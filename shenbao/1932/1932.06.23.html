<p>時評</p>
<h3>從粤亂説到廢止内戰</h3>
<p>滬變初定。創痛猶新。國人怵於外侮紛乘。國勢危殆。方羣起倡導和平。廢止内戰冀以團結我民族之全力。共謀打破當前之大難。而重奠我國家之新基。即一部分軍人。似亦已覺悟其過去之罪戾。而表示再不參加内戰。然而非戰之聲方喧。粤中閲牆之禍又作。舉國人民平和之呼籲。終不能激發快於内戰者之「天良。」終無以戢止殘民禍國之干戈斯眞至足以令吾人悲憤嘆息者矣。</p>
<p>粤中之風雲。以陳濟棠陳策爲其主角。禍變醖釀。已歷數月。今且調兵遣將。開始火併。大戰且在目前而檢視此一幕悲劇之裏面。其關聯之綜錯複雜。實不僅爲局部之變亂。蓋自去年所謂統一和平會議勉强產生相安於一時之統一和平局面以來。西南畸形之政權。始終存在。而其與中央方面則更貌合神離無日不在鈎心鬥角之明爭暗鬥中也。</p>
<p>夫以我國今日之情勢言。内戰之决不容再有。雖三尺之童子。應亦知之。强宼壓境。國脈絲懸。彼飄搖於山海關頭者伊誰之旗幟乎。彼縱横於東北原野者又爲伊誰之鐵騎乎。山河破碎。種族凌夷。凡屬血氣之倫。都應移其目光以對外。都應矢其全力以禦侮。然而自東北淪亡。以至滬變再發。西南方面終始未見出一兵一卒。以赴國難。而所謂海軍。則更終始不見踪影獨於内爭。則厲諸色。形諸言。終且以干戈相見。嗚呼。人民出其血肉以養兵。不能衛國。乃適以禍國。不能保民。乃適以殘民。槍口不以對外。但知對内。迄於今日。猶不覺醒。是則豈僅可哀。抑更可恥。</p>
<p>日前廢止内戰大同盟致電西南當局。責以防遏内戰覆電則謂「並無内戰意義。」各有藉口。其言固亦似堂皇正大矣。但吾不知究將如何而後可謂爲内戰也。</p>
<p>國勢危矣。民苦深矣。事至今日。内戰决不容再有。亦决不應再有。而竟有之。則可知今日之軍閥。决非平和之勸導所能感化。亦非涕泣之呼籲所能斷其仁慈。尤可知軍閥所賴以生長之背景。一日不根本推翻我國之内戰亦終無止息之一日。非戰固人同此心。然而非者自非。戰者自戰。事實昭著。顯在目前。故吾人今而言非戰。應知軍閥一日不打倒。則内戰一日不能停止。更知國家軍隊不爲人民所有。則不足言打倒軍閥。粤亂爲廢戰大同盟之試金石。否則章程等於廢紙。倡導廢止内戰之諸君子。其亦有以實現其進一步有效之方法乎。吾人實引領以望之矣。</p>

<h3>僞國篡提牛莊安東税欵</h3>
<p>宋子文再發宣言</p>
<p>關於大連海關問題</p>
<p>日外務省同情僞國</p>
<p>（北平）宋子文以日嗾僞國不顧一切抗議與條約、竟刦取東北關税、今報根牛莊安東海關電告税欵被刦情况、再發英文宣言、公告世界、（二十二日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）財長宋子文今日宣稱、東北海關事、雖疊經提出抗議、且此事確爲違反條約恊定、而日本與「滿國當局今仍實行强刦存積牛莊安東之税欵、宋並述牛莊安東税務司來電之要略、牛莊之電、乃六月二十日所發、内稱新監督代表今日携滿洲國」財政部函來謁、令余將存於中國銀行之税項、開一支票、交付滿洲銀行、並禁續以税項解交國民政府、如不遵行、則將視爲敵對、而將取有力的計畫云云、余即拒絶、該員乃稱、將刦取税項、二十一日又來電稱、所存於中國銀行之税項、昨日均被用武力移往滿洲銀行、余向横濱正金銀行提出抗議、並要求解欵、該行行長昨已電總行請示云、安東税務司六月二十日來電稱、中國銀行正式來函聲稱、六月十九日接滿洲財長之恫嚇函、當地警務長亦來行、令勿移動税項、故已將所存税項餘欵交出、又所存少數海關行政費、亦經交出、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於滿洲國接收大連海關問題、一部以爲日本如果承認、英美兩國、必聯袂而向日本抗議、外務當局關於此事、曾表示意見、分爲下列二點、（一）此爲中國政府與滿洲政府間之問題、與日本無關、誠然、照明治四十年中日海關條約、係規定大連海關長、須以有日本國藉之人充任之、故現任海關長、爲福本氏、但福本在中國政府管理下而行動、非日本所得而知、（一）大連海關及滿洲各地之海關收入、係滿洲住民所負擔、鑑於此徴税之性質、則對滿洲國此次處置、可表同情、但其最終的解决方法、尙未决定、從大連海關收入一千二百萬兩、除去外債擔保四成、殘餘之七百餘萬海關兩、除由中國政府與滿洲國、平均分配、爲政治的解决外、别無方法、甚至在北平開公使團會議、亦未可知云、（二十二日電通電）</p>
<p>（北平）宋子文今日發表關於大連海關設立之法律上與歷史上之背景申明書如下、自稱「滿洲國」非法政治機關之代表、今圖動用日本所租遼東地内大連海關之税收、如果實行、則爲日本破壞與中國所訂之條約義務、且將搖動海關本身之完整、而更遠大之問題、牽涉遼東租借地之地位者、亦將因代表所謂「滿洲國」之個人侵犯該地中日權利義務之行動而引起矣、夫所謂「滿洲國」者、不過一在日本顧問指揮下之政治機關耳、遼東租借地目下雖由日政府管理、而在法律上仍爲中國之土地也、此種特殊之地位、乃由一八九八年原訂租約而發生、實爲中國主權法令之結果、與中國東三省即滿洲存在之行政體制、毫無關係、所謂「滿洲國」當局對大連海關之任何干涉、皆屬違反中日租地條約之條欵、日本旣握租地之行政權、責當遵守原訂租約中訂明之信託條件、大連海關設於日政府管理之租借地内、如自稱奉「滿洲國」之命行事之個人加以任何干涉、則中政府將視爲違反條約之條欵、日本今仍佔有遼東租借地、亦即根據此約之條件也、關於此節所不當忘懷者、即原訂租約中規定雖行政權歸屬日本當局、而租地之舉、毫不侵犯中政府對該地之主權、則中政府之徴收大連海關關税、當然不成問題、查一八九八年七月六日中日條約之第五欵、而於一九○五年後約束日本者、規定中國可在邊界對由租借地運入内地或由内地運入租借地各貨徴收税項、此種税關、應專由北京政府管理、今謂遼東租借地乃向所謂「滿洲國」租借、直爲笑談、其所謂「滿洲國」者、甚至尙未臻事實之存在、其所自稱所轄之土地、尙不能管理、僅具一種飄渺之政治機關、其實權全操諸自稱僱員之日顧問手、此種無定形之政治機關、甚至日本尙未予以承認、彼自署「滿洲國」官員之圖動用大連海關税欵、更足引起日本之條約義務問題、同時且危害中國海關本身之完整、此種事實實爲中外各國所不得不嚴重注意者也、（未完）（二十一日路透社）</p>

<h3>歡迎新美使席上石井發揮亞門羅主義</h3>
<p>暗示美國勿阻日本侵華</p>
<p>否則美日戰爭將不可免</p>
<p>路透社二十一日東京電　日美恊會今晚開宴會、歡迎新任駐日美大使格魯、德川公爵·齋藤首相·前駐美大使石井子爵·及許多要人均與會、石井致歡迎詞、略謂近有謠言遍傳於世界各處、以爲日美間武裝衝突或將發生、此種觀念、兩國有識之士固皆斥爲荒謬、但惡宣傳之不斷的工作、漸使人心惶慮、此種衝突當然爲不可能、惟在兩件極端未必有之情事中、始或有之、此兩事如下、（一）如日本妄冀非分干涉西半球事件、則戰事當不可免、但日本朝野不務外事、堅决不作除和平而外之任何事件、（二）如美國欲支配亞洲大陸、而阻止日本在亞陸施展其和平與天然之開拓、則時局亦必甚屬嚴重、但渠知美國所注意於東方者、厥爲和平之維持、與條約之尊重、故上述之美國干涉、乃未必有之事、亦猶日本之未必干涉西半球也云、美大使格魯致詞答覆、切實聲明美國利益在持久的和平、謂一九一四年至一九一八年黑暗時代之記憶、今雖稍减其堅强、但此數年之經騐、已在美國人民心理中、植立一種志願、欲以精神與事實、鞏固國際和平之結構、使之永不爲時代與環境所變更云、</p>
<p>路透社二十二日紐約電　據紐約時報載稱、石井子爵所表示美國欲支配遠理之恐慌、並未引起華盛頓反對之評論、其理由爲石井之演説、雖暴露一種亞洲門　主義、而語氣尙屬和緩也、華盛頓當局現信石井之議論、非指六月十日國務卿史汀生致日本之通牒表示美國關心兼併東三省海關事者、殆指自去年九月以來中國事變進程而言、</p>
<h3>美代表宣示態度賠欵軍縮成連鎖關係</h3>
<p>軍縮總委會昨日突然召集</p>
<p>世界目光由洛桑移日内瓦</p>
<p>法國態度繫會議成敗關鍵</p>
<p>國民社二十二日内瓦電　軍縮會議總委員會將於今日下午開會、俾美總代表吉白生可得、陳述美國軍縮態度、之機會、此次總委員會之突然開會、係出於軍縮會議主席漢德森之特别請求、刻在洛桑之法總理赫禮歐、英相麥唐納、與德外長紐拉恩等均將來此出席、此時美國之突然出而干預賠欵問題、仍爲國聯中人閒譚目標、且料今日會中即或吉白生不再當衆以軍縮與賠欵問題相連鎖、恐亦將發生新驚人消息、逆料吉氏定將發一雙關宣言、聲明美國期望軍縮會議獲得若干實在結果、嗣乃陳述美國希望採用之計劃、聞其計劃主張廢除一切侵略軍器、裁减現有常備軍百分之二十四、並於海陸軍費作同様之裁减、惟法人方面料將强烈反對、故此計劃顯似仍少打破僵局之希望、更據英代表團表示、法人之堅拒對美讓步、足以妨碍英法間前於賠欵與軍縮若干基本點所得之初步同意云、</p>
<p>路透二十二日日内瓦電　目下羣衆之目光已由洛桑移向日内瓦、新聞家外交家政治家現正絡繹趕到此間、參與今日之軍縮總委員會會議、</p>
<p>路透二十二日華盛頓電　外交界中今日盛傳國務卿史汀生已命軍縮會議美總代表吉白生告知現集日内瓦之歐洲政治家、如軍縮會議結局失敗、則歐洲可打銷希望美國以好意考慮戰債請求之妄想、此言雖經否認、而傳者皆言之鑿鑿、又參議員狄克生有言曰、世界如能眞正減少軍備、則吾人可整理國際債務、衆視此言足以代表共和黨一般之意見、又政府發言人李德曰、吾人確已告知歐洲、非俟已有眞實之行動、趨向軍縮、則空談取銷或減削戰債、實無濟於事云、</p>
<h3>美總統澈底軍縮計劃</h3>
<p>路透社二十二日紐約電　胡佛總統提議縮減世界軍備三分之一、其建議中包含、（一）廢除坦克車·化學戰法·大口徑之活動砲、（二）減少陸軍兵額三分之一、（三）廢除轟炸飛機、（四）禁止天空轟擊、（五）縮減條約規定各種戰艦、噸位與隻數三分之一、（六）縮減條約規定飛機母艦巡洋艦驅逐艦四分之一、潛艇則三分之一、（七）無論何國不得置潛行之船隻逾三萬五千噸、</p>
<h3>法國對軍縮之新建議</h3>
<p>路透二十二日日内瓦電　今日法國以關於民用及軍用飛機之偉大建議、提交軍縮會議天空委員會、主張絶對禁止天空·化學·黴菌·縱火之戰事、除戰塲或飛機根據地及長射程之砲隊安置地外、禁止由天空轟擊、並提議規定軍用飛機每機至大之噸位、（未裝物之重量）專爲自衛用超過此規定噸位之飛機應有限額、且當歸國聯指揮、此外尙提議大陸商業航空運輸應歸國有、非國際的民用飛機、應規定每機至大噸位之同一根據、關於軍器買賣與私家製造、應定相稱之計劃、加拿大代表起而爭稱、此項建議就民用飛機而論、可施於歐洲、但殊不適宜於幅員廣大在發展中之國如加拿大者、美代表亦贊同此言、嗣乃展期討論、</p>
<h3>日刧關税將提出討論</h3>
<p>路透二十二日日内瓦電　明日中國代表將提出滿洲國刦奪大連海關税項事、</p>
<h3>賠欵會議暫停止活動</h3>
<p>國民社二十一日洛桑電　法比代表現正草擬一聯合説帖、臚舉兩國準備對於修改楊格計劃之讓步條件、故洛桑會議今日暫停活動、僅於今夜英相麥唐納與法總理赫禮歐又會晤一次、而德總理巴本亦與比相冷京晤商甚久、其他代表亦復於旅館房間内或公用休息室中互相聚談、作長時間討論、但就今所知、對於因法國拒絶總勾銷後所造成之僵局、仍未有稍能展開局面之建議、且會議前途、反因美軍縮代表吉伯生與麥唐納赫禮歐在莫爾奇山村秘密軍縮會議結果之披露而益形黯淡、迄今有關係各國代表無一否認此次秘密軍縮會議、因赫禮歐拒絶考慮美國軍縮計劃、致告决裂之説、據稱、赫禮歐堅持法國必須有相當之安全、故僅能考慮從性質的軍縮、最後卒致美國發出類似衰的美敦之表示、無結果而散、據聞吉伯生曾有强硬表示、倘歐洲用於軍備之費、比其所欠美債尤多、則美國不能考慮修改戰債恊定、又謂欲望美國作金錢之犧牲、必須自己先有所犧牲以爲先導云云、此種消息披露後、此間極爲重視、因美代表吉伯生猶係第一次承認軍縮與戰債兩問題有連鎖關係、故頗認爲重要、</p>
<h3>美首席代表潛赴洛桑</h3>
<p>國民社二十一日洛桑電　今日軍縮會議美首席代表吉伯生偕同台維斯、突出一般人意料之外、秘密至洛桑、與英相麥唐納英外務大臣西門密談一小時之久、事後吉伯生語新聞記者云、「吾輩談論軍縮、此雖奇突、却係實情、」按兩人係從日内瓦而來、消息旣傳、一時羣相揣議、咸謂當與賠欵會議之發展有關、但吉伯生語人、倘遇事勢所必要、吾輩或將再來洛桑一次、惟吾輩之來與賠欵會議無關云云、其後英外相西門即偕美代表還日内瓦、現一般人意見以爲代表雖有所談祗限軍縮之聲明、兩人此行實爲美國已有將戰債問題與軍縮連鎖趨嚮之又一明證、暗示歐洲國家倘有眞正軍縮誠意之表示、則美國亦未嘗不可稍緩其索債、蓋美政府前固已明白表示、倘歐洲國家以减輕債務後所省之欵、而用於新戰爭利器之投資、則美國人民决不能贊成减削戰債者也、</p>
<h3>史汀生否認討論戰債</h3>
<p>國民社二十一日華盛頓電　美國務卿史汀生今日發一聲明書、否認美代表在歐曾於洛桑或日内瓦討論戰債問題之説、蓋歐洲電訊謂吉伯生曾告赫禮歐、非俟歐洲减縮軍備、美國不願考慮减削戰債、故美國務卿有此聲明云、</p>
<p>路透社二十一日洛桑電　美代表吉白生以大西洋電話、與胡佛總統接談良久後、發表一文、將戰債與軍縮兩事併作一談、吉白生聲明、歐洲現用於軍備者、多於償還欠美債務所須用者、歐洲减縮軍備什一、則美國或可考慮减債之説、現漸爲人所信、不因美京傳來否認之消息而遂銷滅、蓋此説縱無官塲根據、然衆信胡佛總統實發起歐洲軍縮什一、則美國可減收戰債之言也、</p>
<h3>麥唐納努力戰勝困難</h3>
<p>路透社二十一日洛桑電　赫禮歐欲得德國一種担保、尤欲得德國鐵路債券之主張、現爲賠欵會議中之主要障碍、英相麥唐納刻正努力擬戰勝此困難、今晨麥唐納與赫里歐密談三小時、尙未成立恊定、法國固未有提議停付賠欵與戰債之問題、但法國已知賠欵與戰債今已毫無生氣、英外相西門今晨與法美代表集議於日内瓦、聞此會有甚重要性質、並聞會商後有若干事件已電逹美京候示、西門於散會後、即返洛桑與麥唐納午餐、並報告與美法代表會商之經過情形、未幾麥唐納往晤美代表吉白生、結果雙方一致同意、麥唐納贊成吉白生所提出之美國提議、衆望明日當有甚重要之發展、</p>
<h3>法國賠欵新方案内容</h3>
<p>路透社二十二日洛桑電　關於賠欵問題、茲悉法代表昨日提出方案、包括（一）今後三年内德國停付賠欵、（二）前定以貨物抵償賠欵之額數、仍須照給、（三）停付期間滿期後、德國須交付一筆　欵、該欵將歸美國及其他債權國按照比例分攤、</p>
<h3>比與法立於共同戰線</h3>
<p>路透社二十二日洛桑電　賠欵會議比法代表對於籌賠欵問題、已商妥立於共同之戰線、外間甚至謠傳兩國業已商定德國終當付七八十億馬克、惟英國全數勾銷之政策、今仍未變、德國發言人已表示德國不能接受發行鐵路債券之建議、</p>
<h3>德外長呼籲無力繳欵</h3>
<p>路透社二十二日洛桑電　德外相牛頓資今晨致文麥唐納、重行聲明德國無力續繳賠欵、並謂各國今急當取聯合行動、以謀解决經濟問題、至於法國以安全是虞、則不妨訂一商榷的條欵、俾遇安全與和平受任何脅迫時、德國能與有關係之列强會商、</p>
<h3>日民政黨分裂</h3>
<p>安逹派宣告脱黨</p>
<p>華聯社二十二日東京電　日民政黨内之安逹派、連名請求允安逹復黨、幹部堅　反對、而安逹派山道裏一組織政治研究會、小池組織政策調查會、準備擁護安逹組織新黨、民政黨領袖昨夜開會討論對策、已决定阻止黨内樹派、今晨十時派町田勸山道取消政治研究會、榴内訪小橋囑勸安逹派勿輕舉、其他領袖召集黨員阻止分裂、今日之勸告竟不見效、安逹派二十餘名决定連袂脱黨、</p>
<h3>智利内亂復遭地震</h3>
<p>路透二十一日山的雅谷電　智利地震、居民恐慌、生命财產損失、現尙未詳、</p>
<p>路透二十二日阿眞廷京城電　智利在過去半月内迭起革命與反革命、頗引起此間人士之惶慮、恐智利得設立軍人狄克推多制、如竟實現、則事態之擾亂將更甚於今日、聞平民集衆攻擊兵士、觀此可知軍人專政之不爲人歡迎、軍民衝突、死者多係平民、以無槍階級與有槍階級相鬥、宜死傷多也、有一艦隊現集於樊巴萊沙、準備於有事時、遣陸戰隊登岸、</p>

<p>張治中報告　今日首都各界追悼淞滬抗日陣亡將士曁殉難同胞、兄弟爲參加抗日戰役之一員、蒞茲盛會、悲痛良深、此次戰役、雖屬國際戰之一種、但實際上仍係國際戰之開端、我全國同胞、應充分準備、參加整個民族戰爭、以爭取我民族之自由解放、此次戰役最著名者、爲閘北江灣藴藻浜廟行瀏河五大戰役、其中尤以廟行一役爲最烈、雙方死傷極大、當二月二十日起至二十二日止、敵傾巢來犯、人數約三萬以上、當時守廟行之我軍、即五軍八十八師之一團、經奮勇抵抗、敵終未得逞、至二十二日敵軍總退却時、雙方已不用大砲轟擊、完全入於肉搏狀態、故受傷官兵、大都係剌刀炸彈所傷、犧牲之大、慘不忍言、於此可見我軍勇敢犧牲及不怕死之精神、此次我十九路軍及五路軍、能以少數擊破多數、亦即此勇敢犧牲精神之表現、凡我國民、應繼續此種精神、打倒敵人、消滅日本帝國主義、現在東北失地尙未收復、我全國同胞及武裝同志、應認清亡東北即亡中國、欲救此危亡、惟一方法、祗有拚命、欲求生路、亦祗有死裏求生、人人具必死之心、然後始能求得生路、兄弟敢代表五軍全體向各位報告、即五軍將士、已準備最後流血、爲國家拚命、希望各界亦具此精神、一致進行、</p>
<p>李濟深演説　今日追悼陣亡將士、兄弟以個人資格、略進數言、頃主祭云、追悼陣亡將士、非開會即算完事、其意不外安慰死者、與勉勵後來、兄弟意思、以爲死者極爲光榮、且已死得其所、毋庸安慰、所可悼者、乃吾後死者耳、蓋東北問題、尚未解决、將來痛苦正深、日前兄弟赴廬山謁蔣委員長、即係商决東北事件、因顧代表此次由東北歸來、云東北情形、極爲悽慘、最可痛心者、即僞國成立後、將東北中等以上學校、完全停辦、一面添辦小學多所、敎以日本文字、此次調查團抵東北後、往請願者多係小孩、事後有一八歲小孩、上書調查團云、此次本不願參加請願、但以種種壓迫、若稍加違抗、即有生命之虞、於此可見日人在東北壓迫人民、及我東北人心未死之一斑、顧代表並言僞國擬訓練二十五萬軍隊、統率入關、圖佔領平津、現在情勢危急、故回京與政府商積極抵抗與援助東北辦法云云、兄弟意思、以爲欲恢復東北、非抵抗不行、且不能徒託空言、民衆方面、尤應有所表示、其辦法、即（一）請願政府積極抵抗、（二）實行經濟抵抗、（三）援助東北義勇軍餉彈、如此積極進行、則恢復東北、方可有望、</p>

<h3>告主張對俄復交者　陳啟天</h3>
<p>並質申報記者陳彬龢君（二續）</p>
<p>但是陳君的答復、竟不是這様、陳君説、「民十六我國對蘇絶交、政府所持之理由、爲」蘇俄主使並參加共產黨暴亂、破壞國民革命不得不採取斷然之處置、」民十八中東路一役、眞如大公報所謂「亦本不應有」、（見五月十九日社評再論對俄復交問題）但年來湘鄂贛皖閩共黨勢力之日益披猖、實在對蘇絶交之後、東北一隅、十六年後對蘇仍互派領事、然而東北共黨勢力、並不如南方之張大、則吾人殆不能不承認以對蘇絶交、防遏共黨之政策、已完全歸於失敗、故謂絶交爲反蘇聯則可、謂爲防遏共產則不可、蓋事實已證明絶交實未能防遏共產也、</p>
<p>至於「現在主張復交是否已解决了這些條件」之問題、亦可不必費辭而解答矣、一九二七年英保守黨内閣小題大做、藉口所謂「阿柯斯房屋搜查」而對蘇絶交、迨一九二九年英工黨重握政權、即行復交、豈在保守黨内閣時代、遂無法防遏「赤化」之宣傳、而在工黨内閣時代遂無所願忌耶、反之保守黨内閣對蘇絶交、遂果眞已使英國共產主義之宣傳絶跡耶、故吾人謂絶交爲反蘇聯則可、謂爲防共則不可、此蓋爲必然之理也、」</p>
<p>讀了上段陳君的答復、我們不能不反問陳君者、所謂中東路一役當然包涵絶交與作戰兩事、搜查哈俄領館只是中東路戰役的起因、搜查的結果獲得蘇聯赤化中國的陰謀證據顯與中俄恊定相違、不能説是「本不應有」、如果説中國搜查本不應有、那末蘇俄利用領事在中國宣傳赤化反是應有的嗎、如果陳君又説我所謂「本不應有」乃指對俄絶交、那末我又告訴陳君、中國對俄正式絶交是在十六年、十八年中東路一役、不是中國又對俄絶交、却反是俄國先對華宣告絶交以爲武裝進攻東北的開山砲、這是俄國對華宣戰的絶交、何以反説中國「本不應有」呢、陳君將事實張冠李戴、致於薄於責人、厚於責己、在國際的關係上是不容如此的、陳君以「東北共黨勢力並不如南方之張大」證明「對蘇絶交防遏共黨之政策、已完全歸於失敗」、理由也不充分、因爲、俄國赤化中國的計劃在東北主防守、在南方主進攻、東北有日俄對峙的勢力、如果先從東北着手赤化、勢必引起日俄的直接鬥爭、與俄國的外交總戰略不合、這是南方共禍盛於東北的一個原因、國民黨曾經聯俄容共、因此共黨勢力隨着國民黨由南而北、國民黨的勢力幾乎始終未逹到東北、所以共黨勢力在東北不如南方、這又是一個原因、共黨勢力最盛的南方幾省如鄂贛皖豫閩等都是南京政府的勢力範圍、而南京政府政治的腐敗、軍隊的混雜、實在東北之上、這</p>
<p>是南方盛於東北的第三個原因、明瞭這幾種原因、就不能説南方匪勢之大、即足證絶交以防共之政策歸於失敗、只可説由於聯俄一着、中毒已深、絶交太遲、防不勝防、絶交之後、又不竭力肅清、反日日造亂、予共匪以發展的機會、致成目前不可收拾的局面、如果再立即復交、爲共助勢、那必定更不可向邇了、</p>
<p>至於陳君對於「現在主張對俄復交是否已經解决了這些條件」這個問題、認爲「可不必費辭而解答矣」、由我看來、所謂「可不必費辭」的解答、顯然是無從措詞的解答、孟子所謂「遁詞知其所窮」、陳君總算會遁、由中國一遁遁到了英國、曾君所問的是中國現在對俄復交是否解决了這些條件、不是問的英國、中國與英國的情形不同、英國對俄復交的事實、决不能做中國也可對俄復交的充足證據我且先説一個譬喻罷、例如張三是個身强體壯的大漢、李四是個千孔百瘡的病夫、張三可以涉水跋山、節風沐雨、李四只宜住在醫院、慢慢調養、如果有人硬勸李四學着張三去涉水跋山、櫛風沐雨、並且設問鼓勵説、（張三可以涉水跋山、你李四爲什麽不可以、張三可以節風沐雨、你李四又爲舉麽不可以、」李四果眞信了這個人的鼓勵、我想陳君必定説李四誤聽人言、一定速死、張三可以説是英國、李四可以説是中國、英國是健全發展的西方强國、中國是外感内傷的病夫、英國的政治早上了民治的軌道、中國的政治還在黨治的笳上、英國軍隊是屬於國家公共的、中國的軍隊還是軍閥私有的、英國國民生活很富、中國國民生活很窮、英國没有受過聯俄的禍、中國早已中了聯俄的毒、英國共黨很少、而且没有武裝勢力、中國共匪很多、而且已有很大的武裝勢力、俄國對英國的外交是防守戰略、對中國的外交却是進攻戰略、由這種種不同的情形看來、可以判定英國對俄復交與否、不足爲中國亦可對俄復交的佐證、英國可以對於對俄復交、也可以對俄不復交、均不足影響英國的國本、但是中國立即對俄復交旣得不着有把握的好處、反而先受助長共勢、動搖國本的害處、這又何苦來、故就中國目前情形看來、反俄即爲防共之一法、絶交固爲反俄、亦所以防共、這才是「必然之理」、陳君「所見、不亦太左耶、」</p>
<p>陳君又以爲復交仍有方法防共以塞反對者之口、他曾説、</p>
<p>「邦交儘可恢復、而共產宣傳上可以正當之手段交涉制止、此兩事不能並爲一談、」</p>
<p>復交與防共雖不能完全併爲一談、但是復交之時、必須顧及有無方法防共、以免因復交而助共陳君於此點告訴我們「可以正當之手段、交涉制止」、我要請問所謂「正當之手段」是什麽、照國際慣例、當然不外條約或恊定等手段、决不是憑口説、十三年中俄恊定早已有下條的規定、</p>
<p>「第六條　兩締約國政府互相担保在各國境内不准有爲圖謀以暴力反對對方政府、而成立之各種機關、或團體之存在及舉動、並允諾彼此不爲與對方國公共秩序社會組織相反之宣傳、」</p>
<p>這條規定明明説不許蘇俄在華宣傳共產、然而八年來的事實、共黨是由俄成立的、俄國在中國不但有與中國公共秩序社會組織相反之共產宣傳、並且還以暴力反對中國政府、於是恊定成了廢紙、有交涉等於無交涉、中國要制止、俄國要宣傳、所謂「正當之手段」、其效果早已如此、還再可信賴嗎、</p>
<p>陳君對於以上一點、旣不能予我們以滿意的答覆、又撇開對俄復交與助共的關係不多説、而特别將其論點置在「中國現狀爲最適合於共產主義之泥土」上、他説</p>
<p>「問題之重心、在於我國是否適合於共產主義之泥土、是否有足使共產主義流行之機會、如其有之、絶交奚益、如其無之、復交何害、置　問題之根本不問、而欲以閉門政策、防遏共產主義之流入、吁、物已先腐、雖置之鐵匣、果能保其不生蟲耶、</p>
<p>脱曰、「我國無堅强之統一政府」、「嚴密之社會組織」、「穏定之人民生活」、「無控制共產主義者之把握」、故不容步武列强大開門户、讓「赤色恐怖之陰謀者」、自由出入、是則吾人旣已認定我國爲最適合共產主義之泥土矣、我國旣有此泥土、世即無蘇聯、亦難保不有革命之事實爆發、歷史上之變亂、斑斑可考、不修明内政、不安定民生、而欲以對蘇絶交、爲防遏亂萌之手段、所見不亦太左耶、（未完）</p>

<h3>古廟敲鐘錄（卅）（一）　不除庭草齋夫</h3>
<p>三十四</p>
<p>我説；「小時怕鬼，終身怕鬼，這是千眞萬眞的。我是天不怕，地不怕，甚至於老虎都不怕。止有那鬼呀，只要一説到那個字，我的毫毛就站起來了。朱先生！可有法子消除這個黑夜的恐怖？」</p>
<p>朱先生説；「我像你這大年紀是和你一様的怕鬼。我的祖母，我的外婆，以及左右隣居的親戚朋友，描寫給我聽的鬼，不下十幾個，一個個的都在他們的嘴唇上活躍，在我的心窩裏作怪，使我站在旁邊，全身都打寒顫而發抖。我聽過之後，再也不敢獨自一個進到房裏去，夢裏是必定幾次被那披頭散髮的東西駭得哭。小孩們的恐怖老人家是不會體諒，風雨之夜没有事，還是依舊的談，談得我們的膽子都要駭破了。」我插了一嘴説；「你現在還怕不怕？」朱先生説；「現在不怕了，我在十七歲的一個夏天，當太陽落山的時候，下了一個决心要去看鬼。我家離學堂有六十里路程。這時暑假剛剛過了一半。我是日裏到學堂裏來訪朋友。本來可以在朋友家過夜，可是我想做兩種試騐；一看我能不能走一百二十里；二看路上究竟有没有鬼，所以就决定當晚回家。一路要經過好多個亭子，内中有三個亭子據説是出鬼的。朋友們的勸阻都不聽，我買了一個小燈籠，幾支蠟燭，一盒火柴就動身。走了一點多鐘，遠遠的望見第一個亭子就打了一個寒顫。離亭子差不多十丈路光景，我的毫毛全都站起來了。將近到了亭子門口，我看準了出口，閉了眼睛，兩步當一步的跑出亭子。</p>
<p>好傢伙！越跑越恐怖，好像是有鬼兒在後面追來。跑了幾十步，脱離了鬼的勢範圍，我開始質問自已説；「你幹什麽？你不是來看鬼嗎？如果有鬼，你能跑得掉嗎？如果無鬼何必閉起眼睛跑呢？對！我來爲的是看鬼。到了第二個亭子，我一定要看！」新的决心增加了我百倍的勇氣。走到第二亭，毫毛還是有些竪起。這新决心呌我大膽前進；我是一步一步的從從容容的走進亭子，到了亭心，四邊一望，没有什麽，便有大步闊步的走了出去。第三個亭子是同様走進走出連毫毛也竪了。我征服了鬼！我征服了我心裏的鬼！我征服了我的長輩無意中駭了我十幾年的虚造之鬼！我這個勝仗是用了九牛二虎之力衝鋒衝出來的。你要想征服你心裏的鬼也得要奮鬥。只有决心能征服一切，連鬼在内。我們若能敎導鄉下婦人不再和小孩們講鬼，小寳寳們要少幾多恐怖，等到他們長大起來，也就用不着像我們這様費力的去打鬼了。」</p>

<p>南京電　中大金大軍校金中四校聯合運動會、二十一·二十二·二日在中大運動塲舉行、中大一零五分、　冠軍、金大冷培根之鐵餅三四米六九、打破全國紀錄、中大孟善閔跳高一米七五、鄧堪　三級跳十二米七三、均破江大紀錄、</p>
<h3>草地網球賽中華勝北草地</h3>
<p>中華全勝五組比數爲十五比零</p>
<p>丨明日中華對南草地補賽丨</p>
<p>草地網球聯合比賽、昨日中華網球會初次出馬、對跑馬廰北草地在中華網球塲比賽、驕陽普照下、觀者紛至沓來、中華軍容整肅、精神奮發、每組均以直落三勝、五組終了、中華全獲勝利、以十五比零、建立奇功、爲中華會在草地聯賽中空前未有之戰績、北草地之全軍覆没、亦出於意料之外、</p>
<p>林鄭搭配第一組　中華第一组爲林賽華與鄭兆佳、上塲時頗不得手、二人發球失誤時見、擊法亦無把握、第二盤起、稍見起色、林寳華之表演、未見美妙、鄭兆佳初則平平、第三盤中、頗多精彩之作、博得觀衆之讚美、對手乃庸俗之輩、殊少出色表演、結果中華以六比三、六比零、六比一勝、北草地選手爲ＬＪ柯爾登與納許、</p>
<p>江余聯絡欠純熟　第二組中華由江道章余田光代表、雙方戰頗劇烈、對手爲　勃斯與哥特根、頗有得心應手之妙、江道章稍屬老將、余田光固爲後起、但因初次配合、不能聯絡、時有相讓失分之弊、結果江余雖以八比六、六比四及六比四勝、但頗見吃力、且爲最後一組結束、</p>
<p>屠梁在同一戰線　屠開元與廣州來滬之梁德光、在第三條戰線上、屠君球藝、已爲滬人熟諗、梁德光尙爲初次顯其身手、其球藝似較余田光稍差一籌、但頗鎭靜、二人對付技術平平之葛爾斯與伍萊、誠爲控囊取物、屠梁以六比四、六比三及六比一勝、</p>
<p>郭吳組最先成功　五組中最先結束者、爲第四組郭啟逹吳祝仁、對希脱漢姻與Ｂ柯爾登、郭吳二君、善於耐戰、毫無火氣、故失分殊少、球之忽遠忽近、忽高忽、低、每使對手疲於奔命、招架乏術、三盤終了、郭吳以六比零、六比三、及六比二勝、殊見容易、</p>
<p>馮沈威風亦不减　第五組中華會由老將馮錫康與新進沈美鎭配合、二人威風不减、亦以直落三獲勝、比數爲六比四、六比一及六比二、對手爲希許姆與貝宥、沈君善正手長抽、左臂將軍馮錫康四面顧到、恰到妙處、且二人聯絡上、尙見凑合、</p>
<p>明日將戰南草地　上星期三之第一次賽、中華會原對跑馬廳南草地、因天雨停止、茲悉兩會於明日（星期五）下午五時補賽、地點在中華網球塲、南草地有惠特及史篤克等名將、不若北草地之善於應付、中華會務須謹愼從事、將來或有錦標希望、</p>
<h3>世界重拳錦標美人傑克奪自德人手中</h3>
<p>十五圍合傑克多勝一圍</p>
<p>明年斯時麥克捲土重來</p>
<p>二十一晚約紐長島美狄生塲内、互相視爲勁敵</p>
<p>之德人麥克薛墨林與美人傑克夏蓋、作世界重量擊拳錦標賽、十五圍合形形色色、一一呈映於觀衆之前、喜駭百出、笑啼皆非、迨至大戰終止、裁判宣告美人夏蓋得勝、塲内八萬民衆、頓時大聲歡呼、祝賀成功、二年來全球視爲不易解决之懸案、至此暫告一段落、</p>
<h3>（一）兩雄興師</h3>
<p>往年麥克勝利之來、由於傑克犯規所造成、論者謂其不無僥倖、此次傑克得利、結果不過多勝一圍合而已、則二人眞實本領、似在水平綫上、不能强别其高下、來年斯時、安知麥克不又將越居傑克之上乎、</p>
<h3>麥克將捲土重來</h3>
<p>德人麥克、度其一年安逸生活之後、於其原有藝術、毫未退步、大戰之前、全塲擁戴之聲浪、較高於傑克、成六對五之比、十五圍合歷程之中、出其堅忍不屈之精神、向前奮鬥、而時時壓迫傑克、使其退縮於圍繩之旁、迨至終局、傑克以出擊次數之多、獲得酬報、但有人主見、謂麥克乃受刦者、據繩旁專家所述、德人勝九圍合、傑克四圍合、其餘二圍合、不分勝負、喬治麥端遜三裁判員之一、予麥克十圍合、惟喬治開來及史密斯二裁判則贊成傑克、當裁判宣佈冠軍姓名時、觀衆顯有一平之表示、麥克似見一時目定口呆、然不久回復故態、步至傑克之前、握手而致賀詞、以示其英雄之氣槪、善乎麥克對記者之表示、謂我非甚爲惱喪、然傑克時時受迫而得勝利、此安可者、我將捲土重來、來年再較手腕可矣、</p>
<p>本届世界重量擊拳錦標美人傑克夏蓋氏</p>
<h3>傑克竟償其宿願</h3>
<p>傑克一自犯規失敗之後、傷心可知、但以來日方長、早遲必能逹到勝利之目的、過去二年之内、專心苦練、金剛不壞之身旣成、乃出與麥克作再度之爭雄、故擊拳界曾有惟傑克可敵麥克之謠傳、而美國士女、尤屬關懷、幾莫不各盡其能力、鼓勵此唯一希望之擊拳家、奪冠軍榮銜自彼德人麥克手中、當時一幕十五圍合之結果、傑克竟得償其宿願、美人之狂喜可知、事後此勝利將軍將緩步出場時、大受觀象包圍、幾至不得舉步、或謂傑克斯時排衆出圍之困苦、彷彿與麥克對壘時也、</p>
<h3>（二）大戰眞相</h3>
<p>二人戰績、甚見平均、傑克身量較重、不無便宜、傑克二百零五磅、麥克一百八十八磅、十五圍合中、傑克勝第一、第二·第三、第六·第八·第十四等六圍合、麥克勝第五·第十·第十一·第十二·第十三等五圍合、第四·第七·第九·第十五等四圍合秋色平分二人經此劇戰、咸受巨傷、錦標傑克一目竟至腫閉、麥克嘴唇開裂流血、但均未倒地、</p>
<h3>傑克得力前半局</h3>
<p>第一圍合　傑克開始攻擊、一舉中麥克之頰、左右手又隨之俱進、麥克回擊、亦中傑克之鼻、互相揮擊之中、傑克攻人二下、而同時顎下亦受中一下、（是圍傑克勝）</p>
<p>第二圍合　麥克奮起、迫傑克於繩旁、傑克靜以待動、右手擊中麥克頭部、左手又中敵人耳上、又二下擊中鼻樑、麥克得勢而受擊、不善利用時會也、將終時、麥克擊中傑克耳部、（是圍傑克勝）</p>
<p>第三圍合　傑克先開手、中人頰部、麥克報之以重拳、隨後二人互視對方鼻部爲目的物、各中一下、幾而麥克又中人三下、（是圍傑克勝）</p>
<p>第四圍合　德人先中人之面部、而美人亦予以相當回擊、接後互相打擊、各無便宜之處、將終時、傑克忽下一手、擊在人之下部、麥克受之毫不退縮、是舉大衆觀衆注意、蓋二年之前、傑克即以此犯規失敗、再者紐約擊拳委員會新近通過一議案、謂如受下部攻擊而倒地者、須起立繼續作戰、不然受擊者作失敗論、（是圍平手）</p>
<p>第五圍合　是圍之始、互相攻擊、麥克受迫退至繩旁、繼而反迫敵人於繩旁、且加以擊下、此爲麥克開始得勝之第一圍、（是圍麥克勝）</p>
<p>第六圍合　麥克初占勢、忽連受人擊、綜觀是圍、傑克形勢較佳、麥克處於防衛地位、（是圍傑克勝）</p>
<p>第七圍合　是圍二人各受劇擊、麥克中人顎下、傑克爲之震盪不已、傑克報之重手、亦中人顎下、麥克竟然流血、最後傑克又中人之口部二下、（是圍平手）</p>
<p>第八圍合　傑克忽來猛擊、幸麥克避獲得法、麥克反而回擊一拳、傑克竟爲之動搖、在互撲之下、傑克擊數較多、占得勝利、（是圍傑克勝）</p>
<h3>麥克反攻已過遲</h3>
<p>第九圍合　傑克擊人口部、又二中人之頭部、麥克則直中傑克顎下、（是圍平手）</p>
<p>第十圍合　麥克開始反攻、中人身部、又中人面、麥克嘴唇受擊、破裂流血、但仍占上風、屢中敵身、（是圍麥克勝）</p>
<p>十一圍合　麥克大興奮、攻擊甚厲、傑克左目受傷、（是圍麥克勝）</p>
<p>十二圍合　麥克見敵人左目受傷、乃專攻此處、果然傑克大爲所困、（是圍麥克勝）</p>
<p>十三圍合　麥克仍注意對方傷目、而時時加以毒手、傑在克反攻不利、（是圍麥克勝）</p>
<p>十四圍合　麥克初下毒手、傑克反之以道、其時傑克傷目腫大、將漸見關閉、然而回擊得法、頗占上風、（是圍傑克勝）</p>
<p>十五圍合　最後一圍、形勢緊張、初傑克中人頭部、而麥克又中其傷目、此後往返之間、各有擊中、（是圍平手）</p>

<h3>公共租界電力公司工潮</h3>
<p>黨政機關派員會同調查</p>
<p>工人表示靜候依法辦理</p>
<p>上海電力公司、自新大班霍根斯蒞任後、於六月四日、將斐倫路老廠工作十餘年之老工人、開除一百二十一人、以致激成全體二千五百餘工人之公憤、市黨部社會局、昨派幹員調查、進行調處、茲將各項詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>訂立合同　公共租界電氣事業、原爲工部局管轄、於民國十八年、讓售美商經營、當時訂立電氣事業合同、對於職員之待遇、第十四條規定如下、「對於電氣處之中外職員、公司方面、應完全接受工部局之義務、包刮年金養老金及他種權利、利益在内、公司並須承認保留現有各職員、除能力不足或玩忽職務及工部局現行合同中所規定之其他原因外、不得無故辭退、職員方面、於酬勞升職及服務年限等、應受一種保障、不因改歸公司而受危險或不良之影響」、</p>
<p>大批開除　自新大班蒞任後、藉詞營業影響、於本年六月四日將斐倫路老廠西段方棚間、中段方棚間、揚州路方棚間、中段商頭間、東段高頭間、工作十餘年之老工人一百二十一人、並不宣布其理由、驟然辭退、對於儲蓄金退職金、扣留不發、全體工友二千五百餘人、以工部局對於承受之公司、諄諄囑付、以保障職工權利、具有明證、乃迄今未及三年、公司忽加摧毁、羣起恐慌、當函工部局總裁費信惇請求援助、並呈請市黨部社會局主持公道、秉公調解、而免失業、</p>

<p>工人態度　電力公司工人、昨對新聲社記者云、在工部局管轄之下、待遇尙稱公允、賓主間互相融洽、自讓售於美帝國主義的資本家後、違犯與工部局訂立之電氣事業合同、摧殘工人、對於年老之工人、陸續無故開除、待遇苛刻、與前相差甚鉅、並另雇臨時工人、替代工作、種種壓迫、一言難盡、現我們决靜候黨政機關依法調處、惟在此期内、資本家如果繼續不斷、向我勞工進攻、則恐發生重大糾紛云、</p>

<p>途中失火　該郵船在上海開出後、定明日先到門司、再往神户、詎行至吳淞口外、該輪頭艙内、忽然失火、初時冒烟、經船主霍蘭氏得報、急命輪船員水手人等、就輪内特備之消防器、竭力撲救、查頭艙内貨物無多、僅載零星貨品、故損害或不致過巨、在抵日本以前、火勢可望撲滅、</p>

<p>舊船出售　該公司原行各郵船、多爲九千噸之Ｋ字級輪、茲因新輪完全落成行駛、此項舊船速力較遲、客位亦少、故决定售出、其中第一船名卡摩拉號、向駛倫敦、上海、今由英載貨至滬、昨在上海卸清後、便即開往東洋、售與日本航商、改造後、再行開駛東方各埠、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語录</p>
<h3>土貨的科學</h3>
<p>— 梅</p>
<p>光緒年間，吾們纔看到電的應用，現在到處變成了電力的世界。「電化」是現時代最時髦的名詞，但回額數十年前誰能料到？（翰按蘇維埃＋電化＝簇簇新的布爾札維克主義，電化已成爲確立主義的主要成分了。）</p>
<p>吾們在漢時就發現電的經騐而我們不去推究，偏要待到多少年後，讓西洋人來出風頭，這是多麽可羞的事！</p>
<p>近來無線電的發明，進步一日千里，越弄越神秘了。吾聽得美國某處地方大興土木，在這廣大的建築區裏，到處搜掘并眼，始終没有找到，後來派人到法國去請敎一位無綫電專家，這位專家説：</p>
<p>「容易得很，祗須知道這建築區的經緯度，吾就可以用無綫電來测騐。」這位專家住在巴黎，竟能測斷遠在萬里以外，美國的地下水底位置，豈不是一件奇蹟？曹君仲淵亦知其詳否？</p>
<p>吾以爲要中國科學發逹，必須使科學成爲土貨，决不能始終以舶來品來裝我們的門楣，換言之，我們要自己發明，自己製造，然後科學可以成爲土貨的科學、中國可以成爲科學的國家，曹君有心人，勉之哉。</p>
<h3>曾布</h3>
<p>— 君碩</p>
<p>讀聶太夫人廉儉救國説，同時又聯想到曾布，當曾文正公任欽差大臣恊辦大學士兩江總督時，其身上所穿箭衣，即用河南省所出產之林莊布，論人則道德學問文章功業，並時無兩；論位又屬將相大臣，一旦提倡布衣，屬員幕僚無人不穿林莊布之袍服，一時成爲風尙，林莊布不獨暢銷江蘇，並暢銷各省，尤其是物以人重，時人遂將林莊布改稱曾布，以其爲曾公所提倡故也、由此推想，我國欲挽救今日之經濟危機，提倡國貨，不用洋貨，保存樸儉之國粹，亦非萬難辦到之事，只須物望所歸之人，血誠提倡耳。按曾布多靑灰色，門面僅尺餘，每一件袍料，捲作一卷，大約近三丈，此曾布之特殊點，與他種布疋不同者。近時通都大邑之布店内，徧問竟無此布，年在五十許之做布生意者，尙能知此名稱，惟云已二十多年不銷此布矣。至於年輕之布店夥友，問以林莊布曾布，他還問你是英國的，還是美國法國花旗國的，蓋久已不知有此名稱，更何論當日風行全國之佳話哉？吁可歎也。按聶太夫人爲曾文正公之幼女，前日慧君紀太夫人事，云曾以次女，蓋誤。文正作古之日，尙未嫁，其時太夫人之夫聶公仲芳挽文正聯，自稱待館甥，見榮哀錄。又按曾文正公家書，一女嫁袁漱六之子，一女嫁郭筠仙之子，每嫁一女，規定用銀二百兩，雖當時物價低廉，然以出入將相之家，而樸儉如此，目光遠矣。</p>

<p>夫以一身而瞽。而聾。而瘖。斯誠可謂天下之廢人也已。然有人焉。備此三病。而其心則不瞽。不聾。不瘖。藉此一點心靈。培育其本能而光大之。竟能人定勝天。而與彼聰者明者能言者爭長。甚且駕而上之。斯非天下之非常人乎。伊何人美國之愛倫凱女士ＨｅｌｅｎＫｅｌｌｅｒ也女士生十九月。嬰重疾。而瞽。而聾。而瘖。年十七歲。受育於蘇禮文女士。當時官覺。僅餘嗅與觸二者。及壯。始能言。今則年五十有二。已成全美有名之著作家矣。女士天性聰慧。而其觸覺尤靈鋭。手觸一物。即能言其大槪。且能以觸覺知人之性格。嘗自言。余觸柔滑之手。而知其人爲敎士。觸沉重之手。而知其人爲幽默家。觸羞澀之手。而知其人爲虚僞之勇者。觸鐵拳。而知其人爲彬彬有禮之士。女士愛游泳蕩槳且精於手用印字機。閒輒以十指作勢與人對談。並以手輕觸與談者之唇喉。即能解其發言之意義。故全歐醫士。咸嘆服女士之天才。然女士之精通外國語文。而獲算術學位也。其艱苦卓絶。有非人生意想所能及者。據蘇禮文述女士能言之由來曰。一日余挈愛倫至抽水室。余命持杯承水。杯滿，余持愛倫另一手。於其掌中作水字。Ｗａｔｅｒ時杯水溢。愛倫爲冷所激。狀似驚駭。而擲杯轟立如石人。面呈異象。口拼水字數過。是爲其能言之始。噫。孰料此女童厥後竟能受大學敎育。蜚聲文壇。而成今日美國具大無畏精神擅長口才之大改革家之一。女士學成。專致力於爲聾盲求幸福之事業。所著書。慈祥之氣。現於字裏行間。名著作家馬克土温嘗曰。十九世紀最足令人興奮之人物。厥唯拿破崙與愛倫凱而已。女士近乘羅斯福總統號郵船由紐約赴蘇格蘭。受格拉斯哥大學法學博士學位。其成功之小史。足令殘疾之靑年聞風奮勉。有問女士。如一旦瞽目忽明。願先見何物。女士答曰。首兒童。次犬也。即此一點。亦足以窺見女士之胸襟矣。</p>
<h3>名畫罹劫記</h3>
<p>— 金羊</p>
<p>石谷子王翬。以畫名一代。比及晚年筆墨更神動。蓋已超凡入聖。心手俱化。造詣之深。可直晋宋元名蹟中。非止冠冕當代已矣。是故斷縑零幅。得者如獲異寳。友人陸君。藏有溪山霽雪圖一軸。爲石谷倣李營丘筆意。山勢嶔崎。寒林叢密。近嶺遠峰。皚白如玉。復以水邊蘆葦。客艇漁舟。尤具幽致。通幅以水墨烘托。淡設色。（曾刋入虚齋名畫續錄中）畫本爲陸君先外祖父某公所藏。當紅羊之變。公不遑兼及家資。獨挾此畫偕逃。卒獲倖存。其名貴與珍愛。可覘一般。及傳至陸君。果未嘗稍有損及。歷次驚變。均與偕避。此次倭寇突然犯市。陸君宅次江灣。初以爲僻處安謐。或可倖免。詎知鐵烏横行無忌。卒至無情之炸彈。兼及陸宅。轟然聲起。人眷倉猝逃生。未携一物。徒遙望烈燄中。見名畫與家具。同遭焚如。爲祝融氏羅致收藏矣。陸君驚定之餘。憶及此畫。輒爲唏嘘。蓋物能重置。名畫不可復得矣。惜哉。</p>
<h3>陳玉梅女士的話</h3>
<p>— 鄒生</p>
<p>自從看了「芸蘭姑娘」以後，使我對於主演者陳玉梅女士，像我對於主演「空谷蘭馨」的恩哈婷女士有了同様的好感。伊那様的恬靜的表現，眞值得使人厭棄了克萊拉鮑化的狂熱的沈醉在另外一種幽默的情味之中了。最近我到天一攝影塲去參觀他們攝影，得和陳女士作了十分鐘的談話，這是很有甘甜的回味也很有深刻的意義的。</p>
<p>我問伊那一個好蘭塢的女明星是她所崇拜的，陳女士就説出了一大批的人來，梨琳甘煦啊，露斯蔡德頓啊，珍妮蓋諾啊，······自然，新進的恩哈婷女士也在其内了。伊還説，「我不愛麥唐納的矯揉造作。」</p>
<p>像一朶蘭花似的，陳女士没有一些奢侈和傲慢或呌囂的惡影象。伊穿着一件布製的長袍，脂粉也不施的在攝影塲的一角裏默坐着，當我談起了「芸蘭姑娘」的成績時，伊莞然地謙遜着説：「在有聲中，這實在是我的冒險的嘗試；但我相信，在「一夜豪華」中會得更加使觀衆滿足些，因爲「一夜豪華」這張片子裏的情節，實在太使我受到深刻的剌激了啊。」</p>
<p>伊又講起了自己的生活來，伊説，「做電影的工作，是最快樂也最困難的了。在「一夜豪華」没有開攝以前，把劇本裏的情節和對白，足足研究了兩個多星期：攝有聲片，非有充分的準備是不可的。所以在「一夜豪華」開攝以後，究竟自己能夠滿意得多。」</p>
<p>這一夜，攝製的是另外一本「天一游藝會，」那是熱鬧的非凡的一本歌舞鉅片，大家看了都非常快樂。陳女士却笑着向我説，「可是，請你來看看「一夜豪華」，你又得在極度的快樂之後，給片中人流着同情之淚了，」接着，伊又沈默起來了。在這攝影塲中的一角裏，使我得到了另外一種靜謐的美感。</p>

<h3>馬雙樓記（八七）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主</p>
<p>第十一回　偏枮小邑瞻仰牙旌　猥瑣羣流呵從騶蹕</p>
<p>話説某處濱海之區。有一座斗大的縣城。其名曰海定縣。形勢上雖然襟山帶海。郤是交通阻塞。海無輪舶可通。陸無鐵道可逹。以致僻處海隅。歷來人都視爲荒瘠小邑。縣城以南。距海岸只二十餘里。一望濔漫的原野。與沙灘相似。那鹽滷之氣成年被烈日蒸腾著。五榖不能生。草木不能長。居民除孜孜于漁鹽的微利以外。簡直别無生產。還有東北西三面。面積也有那麽百十方里。偏又是亂峰叢錯。榛莽深密。徒供這亂世中應運而興的綠林豪客們。在平日的出没和憑陵上。得有無窮的便利。若僅照這種情形看來。這海定小縣當是個最難治的縣分。省城中一般鑽營縣知事的差事的。也當視此爲一個苦缺。有些兒趦趄不肯前了。但事實竟恰恰相反。歷來到這裏來幹縣缺的大老爺。來時兩袖清風。去時總可以腰纒纍纍。决不會千辛萬苦虚此一行。因此倒相傳下來是個苦盡回甘的特别肥缺。并因爲縣大老爺的出息好。由人傑而影響到地靈。竟拖帶得這座小縣城也呈現意外的繁榮。共總一座破爛傾圮的矮小磚城。周圍還不過六七里。城内只有縣衙前一條街。有鱗次櫛此的市廛。其餘仍是荒凉得很。郤把一城的獨有的繁榮全集聚在這條街上了。若再把這繁榮的裏面細細解剖一下。還是一種畸形的發展所有生意蓬勃營業暢盛的商店。多半是屬於奢侈的性質。如飯館子。唱雜要的　戲園子。專賣舶來品綢布鐘表丸藥的洋廣雜貨舖子。半公半私窩藏流妓土娼的暗門子。應有盡有。居然也具有現代物質文明的小雛型。此外另有一種很出奇的特色。便是招待過往客商的旅店。多得異常。在那條熱鬧的大街上。就有號稱爲新　文明旅館的十來家。其餘散處于附近小巷裏的老式小客棧。更是星羅碁布。不可勝數。也正因有這些個旅館。容納下那許多的過往客商。才能振興起縣城中的市面。使那條大街上有熙熙攘攘的活躍氣象。</p>

<p>昨日美棉先因蟲害報告而堅、後因華爾街不振而疲、計期貨漲三至四磅音、現貨漲五磅音英棉期貨漲十至十一點、現貨漲十點、埃及棉現貨漲十點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（二十一日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　米市形勢步鬆</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日米市、西路來源十四五號、城鄉店胃比前市爲健、常錫頂客帮買去五百石、價漲五分、早薄稻到湧胃淡、開盤降低一角、洋蘆尖隨到隨銷、市無升沉、變陰元昨到二筒、計貨四百石、酒户如數斛完、</p>
<p>滬北　昨日各帮來源念六七號、本街交易愈覺清淡、常州無錫白粳新鮮定局、中關胃口全無、薄稻飛來鳳斛脚微細、價疲二角、其餘之貨到銷二平、呈下游之象、全日斛開二千二三百石左右、</p>
<h3>洋米跌價動銷</h3>
<p>價小一角本客均有辦裝</p>
<p>昨日洋米續小一角、上午交易清淡、祗開小絞五百包、下午價跌動銷、續開各米二千餘包、市面由疲轉定、惟後市形勢尙難望好、蓋存底太多、必須有大帮去路、方可轉機、昨日辦去者係鎭江南京内地及本街各户、乃係前日試辦合　後、繼續添辦之貨、此後如能逐批合　則後市去胃漸叮發展、市况與價格亦得以逐步轉好、統市開小絞米二千多包、由鎭江南京及本街辦去、本街又去一號中關西貢七百包、價十一元一角半至十一元、紅大絞二百包、價九元二角半、内地帮則辦去温州糙米五百包、價八元五角八分、行情各小一角左右云、</p>
<h3>粉市被客銷帶起</h3>
<p>津帮辦現粉九萬包</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份因洋麥報小二三角、且以天時晴暢、致人心軟弱、七八月份均低至一兩八錢二分七釐半、較前日小一分半左右、惟以後因買氣尙活、客帮微有交易、故又漸好、迨至下午開盤、初仍平疲、惟二盤後因福新開出大批現粉、由津帮分别買定、直送天津、作價一兩九錢三分、計九萬包、（除去水脚實祗一兩八錢左右）人心因客銷之活、故一時買氣驟盛、如七月份最高至八錢四分七釐半、八月份至八錢五分七釐半、九月份至八錢六分半、十月份至八錢七分二釐半、十一月份至八錢八分、較最低時漲二三分不等、惟五盤後以阜豐抛出、祗又跌一分半、結果七月份較前日好二厘半、八月份好五厘、九月份好二厘半、十月份不動、十一月份好五釐云、</p>
<h3>期麥安謐之至</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈穏定之局、以洋麥報價雖小二三角不等、天時亦已晴正、不過本地行家、因某種關係、仍然遇廉收進、賣户方面、目下雖亦步步出檔、惟以低盤之故、必須備有現貨、始能不致搖動、但廠粉豐　、新麥擯住不辦、不免前途帶有隠憂也、結果七月份不動、八月份好一分、九月份不動、十月份好二分、十一月份不動云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　俄莊開辦貢熙茶</h3>
<p>源東路貢熙綠茶、昨日俄國恊助會洋行、業邀集各茶棧進行談判、聞俄莊　價四十八九兩至五十兩、華方認爲過低、新盤尙未開出、惟因此白頭行家、已有深切之注意、聞已發出電報、分致孟買波斯阿富汗等處兜銷、至珍眉綠茶、高莊货依然不動、低莊貨繼續定銷、此外如針層珠茶及祁門紅茶、均有零星交易云、</p>
<h3>瑞士絲銷益减</h3>
<p>英印加徴絲綢進口税</p>
<p>絲織品走銷頓趨呆滯</p>
<p>瑞士所產之絲織品、平日專恃運銷英印兩國茲因英印兩政府施行加徴絲綢進口税百分之二十、致瑞士絲織品走銷頓趨呆滯、生絲消費益减、是以本埠中和新時興愼餘等發往瑞士之廠乾二經電報、近數日中均鮮轉滬、華絲歐銷益陷絶望云、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷糖號開頗盛</h3>
<p>粗砂白劃市步漲</p>
<p>昨日糖市公會市塲劃盤、交易仍盛、荷糖二十四號粗砂白市又步升、成交價爲十四兩一錢、香港貨十三兩九錢、出户且缺、二十號中砂白十三兩六錢、九號荷赤九兩九錢半、市形俏秀、太古糖Ｂ嘜十六兩二錢、天津貨十六兩、ＣＷ嘜十五兩八錢、ＤＹ嘜十五兩六錢、Ｈ嘜十六兩四錢、交易不多、趨勢殊挺、號盤有禎祥號售開香港粗砂白一千五百袋、價十三兩九錢、華新開出二十號中砂白七百袋、價十三兩六錢、又生砂赤一千五百袋、價元十一兩六錢、行方進胃頗濃、故市象均屬堅俏、</p>
<h3>油市　霉令期間之洪桐油</h3>
<p>洪江桐油自入夏令後、銷塲本可發展、乃近因時届黄梅、陰雨連綿、且農民正從事田間工作、改　漆工作、不得不暫行擱置、去路不免稍滯、而走化雖清、但往年如是、故不足爲慮、本埠號家趨此銷路稍緩之際、大槪籌備霉後供給、所以買進尙不寂寞、到貨亦逐日所有、存積似尙充裕、售價以塵元豐十七兩八錢爲正市、祥泰豐集豐盈均售十七兩云、</p>
<h3>疋頭紗價頻跌中之疋頭</h3>
<p>本廠棉布市面、邇日跌風之烈、爲從來所未有良由美棉狂跌、人心搖動所致、長江帮迄難活躍、兼之金融界仍在審愼中、一時難以進展、况各廠存底日多、日廠貨復在活動、致造成此種局面、昨十六磅粗布、　象爲七兩、魁星七兩零五分、十三磅之飛熊人頂球等跌至五兩一錢、十一磅布均在四兩三錢半、九磅布俱已跌入四兩關内、細布莫不跌入七兩之内、汽球紅孔雀均六兩五錢、金城六兩八錢、細斜紋常州貨俱在六兩一二錢、粗斜紋本街略有走動、全屬染坯去路、貓鷹四兩七錢半、三兎四兩八錢半、三魚四兩九錢、人塔六兩七錢半云、</p>
<h3>五金　新鐵行情步漲</h3>
<p>五金交易、邇因霉汛關係、出路鮮少、標準因此不甚進展、惟北路客帮買賣最近趨勢似有進展之望、如新鐵貨談判昨則開出千餘担之鉅、行情比前亦覺良好、如新盤元·三角鐵·新洋元·新洋方等開價比前市均好起五分至一錢不等、惟公會方面、因鑒於此貨成本浩大、况到源又寡、是以均有續漲之提議、而客户及用户方面、聞此消息、購胃反健、是以市面前途、甚覺良好云、</p>

<h3>内戰的解釋</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>内戰的名詞，本來不見諸經傳，不過自民國以來，頻年國内戰爭，一幕一幕開演「閲墻」的拿手好戲，内戰二字，遂成了一個頂時髦的專門名詞，</p>
<p>國人意識淺溥，以爲國人與國人打仗，就算是内戰，今天方曉得完全是弄差，這話從那裏説來，我是有報爲證，　　據昨日某報香港電，「政委會將發通電，説明出師攻瓊，爲誅鋤抗令，與内戰不同」，照這様説來，我們内戰二字的解釋，豈不是完全是差訛了，因爲頻年内戰，兩方多有名目，有名目的均不得作内戰論，</p>
<p>我國旣没有内戰，則内戰的名詞，是從何而來呢？怎様才能算内戰呢？噢！大約是弄差了，九一八事變，可算内戰，一二八事變，也可算内戰，因爲外人戰於我國内地，就是内戰，若國人與國人打仗，這敎做誅鋤抗令，不是内戰，内戰解釋，或是如此，</p>

<h3>新式無線電收音機</h3>
<p>— 乃徴</p>
<p>無綫電的猛進，非其他的科學能夠比得上。近來牠已經到了突然猛進的地位，這數年間的進步，比前數年更快。我們還可以記得，三五年前，普通大家不是都買一只礦石收音機，想聽聽音樂，報告，唱片，等，但起先必定要很危險的爬到屋脊上去架天線，汚穢不堪的掘泥土，或擦乾凈自來水管子，去接地線，接好了，還要細心的觸礦石，戴上了聽筒，聽了蚊子振翼一般的聲音便手舞足蹈，開心得不亦樂乎。但是戴得時間多了，弄得頭漲面紅，並且祇能一個人聽，雖然再有一種用顚空管接喇叭的可以許多人聽，但要拿了數十斤重的蓄電池，到電料店裏去過電，帶來帶去，再要添購電池，弄得氣喘汗流，非常不便·後來就發明一種不必用怎麽甲電池，乙電池的，牠祗要用交流電，即平常我們電燈用的電，我以我們祇要向「卜落」上一插，即可應用，便利非常，這就是新式的無線電收音機·牠非但有這様便利，今年更加有了顯著的改良，增進發音的正確，使與原音酷肖，聲音清朗，毫無别種雜聲，並且美麗堂皇，調整便利，開閉簡易，撰擇精確等，皆足以表示特别進步。現在我簡單的拿牠從外面説到裏面。</p>
<p>新式收音機皆裝在箱匣内，箱匣的質米用木料或金屬，表面髹飾各種顔色的油漆，漆得有的像木紋，有的似桃木的顔色，美麗光滑，非常可愛。牠的形狀有像自鳴鐘的式子，也有貴重的矮櫉箱式子，或是其他各種式様。最新式的收音機，就是價錢低廉的，收聽本埠的播音，可不用天地線，所以没有亂七八糟的電線接進接出，牠祗有一根線通出來，用來通交流電進去的·牠的管理，經過多年的進步之後，已經有一定的標準，現今通行的標準管理，有一只小的電讑，用來開（Ｏｎ）閉（Ｏｆｆ）因爲通出的電線插在「卜落」上後，電流並未通到眞空管内，必須把這小電鑰一開，電流方纔通，普通收音機裏面另外有一只發亮光的小電燈泡亮了，光線從半透明的雲母度數片内透出來，牠報告你知道，裏面電流通了，你可以再用你的手轉選擇柄了。選擇旋轉柄是專門去選擇電臺（Ｓｔａｔｉｏｎ　Ｓｅｌｅｃｔｉｏｎ）的，因爲各電臺所發的波長尺數不同，所以能夠任意旋轉選擇，普通的都附着有度數的圓片，柄轉圓片亦轉，倘使我們要聽ＸＷＣＬ電臺播音，今晚選着了，最清晰的指在幾度上，則明晚旋轉在這度數不可聽得牠的聲音，倘使牠的波長尺數不改變。選擇柄普通都在其他二柄的中間，並且比兩旁二個柄大一些。我們必須再旋轉一個音量管理柄（Ｖｏｌｕｍｅ　Ｃｏｎｔｒｏｌ）使聲量大小，隨心所欲，但從前的收音機放大聲音後，往往不像原來聲音，甚至原來聲音是活潑而富有感情的唱歌，若經過了收音機放大後，好像變成奇怪的哭聲，原來蘇州人的説書，好像變成戲臺上唱京戲的老生的音調，非常難聽·但最新式的收音機，即改良了，有一只音調調整柄（Ｔｏｎｅ　Ｃｏｎｔｒｏｌ），使得放大的音維肖維妙，可以完全像眞，栩栩有生氣。還有雕空的花形，裏襯綢的或絲絨的布，聲音即從這裏出來的。（未完）</p>

<h3>小技士</h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>人類雖然是萬物之靈，但終究也不過爲生活而生存的動物，</p>
<p>無論其爲逹官貴人，無論其爲買辦階級，以至於乞丐盜賊，雖在智識上，有智愚賢不肖之分，而其求生存者則一，也許有時候是利祿心會超高一切，但人類最低的限度，是的確祗求生存，換句話説，也無非是求生活的安適，</p>
<p>星期日老友鄺笑菴君來看我，閒談了一回，終於是因爲無聊和枯寂，便有意無意的邀他到城隍廟去吃茶，</p>
<p>説起吃茶，便又想到我們中國社會民衆的生活習慣，有一部份無聊的人們，他們的光陰是多半消耗於茶館中的，</p>
<p>當我們踏進了得意樓，樓上樓下是早已宣告「客滿」我們好容易在三層樓上找到了一個座位，茶役泡好了茶，接着便是接二連三的乞兒前來討錢，自然這些人可憐而且可厭的，但是轉念想到了整個的社會問題，又不禁發生了深切的感慨，</p>
<p>少時，茶館裏來了一個七歲的孩子，他瘦瘦的面龐，兩顆圓圓的小眼珠，不住的向那些茶客估量着，赤着膞，現出骯髒的體膚，他看了一轉便就地表現起他的技藝來，</p>
<p>他能打拳，他也能翻跟斗，他能倒豎起兩脚，用雙手在地上抓行著，他這様表現了一回，站起來向每個茶客作了一個揖，便照例向他們收取一個銅板，自然是我也未能避免這個義務，</p>
<p>「這是一位小技士呀，」我笑着和鄺君説，</p>
<p>「是呀，但也太可憐了，」鄺君説時又感慨地説道，「外國人學了一些小玩藝，便稱技士，中國的孩子會了這套把戲，却祇好討錢，」</p>
<p>「討錢，這也是一種技藝呀，否則，那一個銅板，也許善人們不是輕易肯佈施的，」</p>
<p>鄺君默然，我也不能再説了，在夕陽西下的時光，我們離開了茶館，彳亍地各自回家，舉頭看那天上的晚霞，正血也似的紅着，</p>

<h3>大菜單</h3>
<p>— 光</p>
<p>滬南Ｓ校，校規雖寛，然而學生缺課，非吃大菜不可，也許是表示校長的寛宏大量，丨本來以前校長進出汽車，何等威風，然而近年來汽車不知去向了，一輛包車代替以前的汽車，</p>
<p>校内對待學生，依然如故，大菜單時常在揭示處可以見到，而且總是「不請則已，一請數十，」不過智多星的學生看到了大菜單，只是説「請客由他去請，不去由我不去，」這個妙法，一傳十，十傳百，差不多全校都效法了，這個不二法門，可以免除吃大菜，所以校長也無法可想，後來忽然籌得一條妙計，「總菜單貼在揭示處，再有個人請客單，在上課的時候，到敎室裏來請」，這條妙計實行了，智多星的學生，也只得徒呼奈何，不得不去一嘗大菜滋味·</p>
<p>最有趣，一天上幾何課，點名後五分鐘，突來一位不速之客，拿出一張大菜單，×敎師讀着，「×××請到訓育處談話」，×××縐着眉頭去了，上課了半小時，又來一張「×××請來圖書館」，末了在退課前三分鐘，又來一張「×××××···等散課後到校長室」被請的學生，不得不在散課後十分鐘内去吃那大菜，敎書的先生，很討厭時時來中止他的講書，學生對於這種請客的政策，很不滿意，不過是「只敢怒而不敢言」，先生抱着「多一事不如少一事」，所以這個請客的妙計，到現在還是不斷的實行呢·</p>
<p>复書</p>
<p>覆書　翻閲前二日報紙、知道有一位先生訽及Ｅｔｈｙｌｅｎｅ一物、是何處購買、他以爲詠槐先生文稿内、詠槐先生已代略覆、查Ｅｔｈｙｌｅｎｅ在常温是一種氣體、藥房中或須不易購到、其製法很多、普通可用酒精與硫酸二物、盛於曲頸瓶内、接以玻璃管、其他一端、接以他瓶、瓶外浸灌冷水、使四周的温度低於常温、酒精與硫酸遇火燒之熱力、發出氣體的Ｅｔｈｙｌｅｎｅ、經過玻璃管入於低温之瓶内、即化爲液體的Ｅｔｈｙｌｅｎｅ可以用快的手續、噴灑於菜葉上、菜菓本身含有水分、他的温度也較常温爲低、Ｅｔｈｙｌｅｎｅ能使菜菓早熟、即因他在空氣中回復氣體時、温度漸高、與菜菓中的水分、在四十八小時内、養化於空氣中、菜菓故能早期成熟、清覆、</p>

<h3>From the Guangdong Troubles to the Abolition of Civil War</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Incident has barely settled. The wounds of creation are still fresh. The people of the nation are alarmed by the multiple foreign aggressions and the precariousness of the national situation. They are rising up to advocate for peace and the abolition of civil war, hoping to unite the full strength of our nation to jointly overcome the current great calamity and re-establish the new foundation of our country. Even some military personnel seem to have realized the guilt of their past and expressed that they will no longer participate in civil war. However, just as the voices against war were becoming louder, the internal strife in Guangdong arose again. The national people's appeals for peace ultimately cannot arouse the "conscience" of those who relish civil war. There is ultimately no way to stop the warring that harms the people and the country. This is truly enough to make us grieve and sigh.</p>
<p>The storm in Guangdong has Chen Jitang and Chen Ce as its protagonists. The brewing of disaster has been going on for months. Now, they are deploying troops and generals, starting a fight. A major battle is imminent. Examining the inside of this tragedy, its connections are complex and intricate, and it is not just a local disturbance. Since last year's so-called Unity and Peace Conference勉强 produced a temporary situation of unity and peace, the deformed regime in the Southwest has always existed. Its relationship with the Central Government has been superficially harmonious but inwardly divided, with open and covert struggles going on every day.</p>
<p>Considering the current situation of our country, civil war cannot be tolerated again. Even a child should know this. A strong enemy is pressing on the border, and the fate of the nation hangs by a thread. Whose flags are fluttering at the head of Shanhaiguan? Whose iron cavalry is rampaging in the Northeast plains? The mountains and rivers are broken, and the race is being humiliated. All those with blood and spirit should shift their gaze outward. All should pledge their full strength to resist aggression. However, from the loss of the Northeast to the re-emergence of the Shanghai Incident, the Southwest has never sent a single soldier to the national crisis. As for the so-called navy, it has never been seen. Only in internal strife do they show all kinds of ruthlessness, expressing it in words and ultimately resorting to arms. Alas! The people offer their flesh and blood to raise soldiers, who cannot defend the country but instead harm it, cannot protect the people but instead slaughter them. They don't point their guns outward but only inward. Until today, they still have not awakened. This is not only lamentable but also shameful.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Great Alliance for the Abolition of Civil War sent a telegram to the Southwest authorities,责以防遏内战. The reply stated that "there is no meaning of civil war." Each has its excuses. Their words are indeed seemingly grand and upright. But I don't know how it can be said to be civil war.</p>
<p>The country's situation is precarious. The people's suffering is deep. Matters have reached this point. Civil war cannot and should not be allowed to happen again. Yet it is happening. This shows that today's warlords cannot be influenced by peaceful persuasion, nor can their benevolence be moved by tearful appeals. It also shows that the background on which warlords rely to grow will not be fundamentally overthrown, and our country's civil war will never end. Being against war is the common feeling of everyone. However, those against it are against it, and those who wage it wage it. The facts are obvious and clear. Therefore, when we speak against war now, we should know that unless the warlords are overthrown, civil war cannot be stopped. We should also know that unless the national army belongs to the people, there is no point in talking about overthrowing warlords. The Guangdong troubles are a touchstone for the Great Alliance for the Abolition of War. Otherwise, the charter is just waste paper. Do the gentlemen who advocate for the abolition of civil war have a way to realize their further effective methods? We are truly looking forward to it.</p>
<p>National Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Wang and Luo Left Beiping to Return South</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen stayed in Beiping and did not go with them.</p>
<p>He still needs to negotiate financial issues.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Jingwei, Luo Wengan, and others left Beiping this morning to return to Nanjing. Gu Weijun, Zhou Dawen, and Zhang's representative Wan Fulin all went to the station to see them off. Wang told reporters before leaving that his mission to the north had been completed. Because all the political affairs in Nanjing need to be taken care of, he urgently needs to return to Nanjing. He will stop briefly in Jinan, perhaps to meet with Han. Whether he will meet with Feng in Tai'an is still undecided. Has, the Secretary-General of the Investigation Team, and Jiang Menglin and Tao Zenggu's new couple also went to the station to see Wang off. Wang and others left Beiping at seven o'clock. Song Ziwen needs to discuss financial issues in North China with local authorities, and he also needs to discuss countermeasures against the destruction of tariffs by the puppet state with all parties. Therefore, he will stay in Beiping for another day or two. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zeng also returned to Beijing with Wang and Luo this morning. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Situation of Wang and Others' Special Train Passing Through Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Jingwei, Luo Wengan, Qin Zhen, Zeng Zhongming, Chen Yaozu, Cao Shaoyan, and others arrived in Tianjin on a special train from Beiping at 9:50 a.m. on the 22nd. Leaders of provincial and municipal agencies all came to the station to welcome them. Wang asked about the local situation in great detail. They left Tianjin at 10:10 a.m. to go south. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang will arrive in Jinan today and is scheduled to visit Feng in Tai'an tomorrow before returning to Beijing. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Refusal to Hire Communicated to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wang and Luo, fearing that they would not be responsible for Gu's life if he went east, plan to telegraph the details of the matter to Yan Huiqing so that he can explain the reasons why Gu is not going to Japan to the League of Nations. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the question of whether Gu Weijun will accompany the investigation team to Japan, Wang and Luo issued a statement before leaving this morning, saying that the investigation team's trip to Japan is specifically to exchange views with the Japanese government based on the recently obtained investigation materials in order to compile a report. This is different from the situation in April when they went to our country's territory in the East to complete the investigation mission. Moreover, when the Chinese government exchanged views with the investigation team, the Japanese representative did not attend. It was originally not necessary for the Chinese representative to participate in the investigation team's visit to Japan to exchange views with the Japanese government. Representative Gu's willingness to serve the country is commendable. However, recently the Japanese side has not welcomed the Chinese representative's accompanying visit, and even said that they cannot protect him. Our country cannot tolerate this kind of unfriendly expression. Therefore, Representative Gu has been instructed not to go. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen to Fly to Beijing Today</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Advisor He Xu of Gu Weijun will fly to Shanghai tomorrow morning. It is rumored that Song will fly to Beijing on the same plane. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Puppet State Usurps Niuzhuang and Andong Tax Funds</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Reissues Declaration</p>
<p>Regarding the Dalian Customs Issue</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Sympathizes with Puppet State</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Ziwen, because Japan instigated the puppet state to disregard all protests and treaties and seize the customs duties of the Northeast, today reported the situation of the seizure of tax funds by the Niuzhuang and Andong Customs. He reissued an English declaration to announce it to the world. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Finance Minister Song Ziwen announced today that although protests have been lodged repeatedly regarding the Northeast customs issue, and this matter is indeed a violation of treaty agreements, Japan and the "Manchukuo" authorities are still forcibly seizing the accumulated tax funds from Niuzhuang and Andong. Song also mentioned the main points of the telegram from the Niuzhuang and Andong Customs Commissioners. The Niuzhuang telegram was sent on June 20 and stated, "The representative of the new supervisor came to visit today with a letter from the 'Manchukuo' Ministry of Finance, ordering me to issue a check for the taxes stored in the Bank of China and deliver it to the Manchurian Bank, and prohibiting the continued transfer of taxes to the National Government. If I do not comply, it will be regarded as hostile, and forceful plans will be taken, etc." I immediately refused. The official then stated that he would seize the tax funds. Another telegram on the 21st stated that the taxes stored in the Bank of China were all forcibly transferred to the Manchurian Bank yesterday. I protested to the Yokohama Specie Bank and requested the release of the funds. The manager of the bank telegraphed the head office yesterday to request instructions." The Andong Customs Commissioner telegraphed on June 20 that the Bank of China had officially sent a letter stating that it had received a threatening letter from the Manchurian Finance Minister on June 19, and the local police chief also came to the bank, ordering not to move the tax funds, so the remaining tax funds stored had been handed over, and the small amount of customs administrative expenses stored had also been handed over. (Reuters telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of Manchukuo taking over the Dalian Customs, some believe that if Japan recognizes it, the United Kingdom and the United States will surely protest to Japan together. The Foreign Ministry has expressed its opinion on this matter, dividing it into the following two points: (1) This is a matter between the Chinese government and the Manchu government and has nothing to do with Japan. It is true that the Sino-Japanese Customs Treaty of the 40th year of Meiji stipulates that the Dalian Customs Commissioner must be a person of Japanese nationality. Therefore, the current Customs Commissioner is Mr. Fukumoto. However, Fukumoto is acting under the management of the Chinese government, which Japan cannot know. (2) The customs revenue of Dalian Customs and various customs in Manchuria is borne by the residents of Manchuria. In view of the nature of this tax levy, sympathy can be expressed for this action of Manchukuo. However, the final solution has not yet been determined. There is no other way than to have the Chinese government and Manchukuo divide the remaining seven million customs taels from the Dalian Customs revenue of twelve million taels after deducting 40% for foreign debt guarantees. It is even possible to hold a meeting of the diplomatic corps in Beiping. (Dentsu telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Ziwen today issued a statement on the legal and historical background of the establishment of the Dalian Customs, stating that the representative of the "Manchukuo" illegal political organ is now attempting to use the tax revenue of the Dalian Customs in the Liaodong leased territory leased by Japan. If implemented, it would be a violation of Japan's treaty obligations with China and would shake the integrity of the customs itself. A far greater problem involving the status of the Liaodong leased territory will also be caused by the actions of individuals representing the so-called "Manchukuo" infringing on Sino-Japanese rights and obligations in that territory. The so-called "Manchukuo" is nothing more than a political organ under the direction of a Japanese advisor. Although the Liaodong leased territory is currently managed by the Japanese government, it is still Chinese territory in law. This special status arose from the original lease agreement in 1898 and is the result of Chinese sovereign decrees and has nothing to do with the administrative system of the three eastern provinces of China, namely Manchuria. Any interference by the so-called "Manchukuo" authorities in the Dalian Customs is a violation of the clauses of the Sino-Japanese lease treaty. Since Japan holds the administrative power of the leased territory, it is responsible for complying with the trust conditions specified in the original lease treaty. The Dalian Customs is located within the leased territory managed by the Japanese government. If any individual claiming to be acting on the orders of "Manchukuo" interferes, the Chinese government will regard it as a violation of the clauses of the treaty. Japan still occupies the Liaodong leased territory today based on the conditions of this treaty. What should not be forgotten regarding this point is that the original lease treaty stipulated that although administrative power belongs to the Japanese authorities, the lease of the territory does not infringe on the Chinese government's sovereignty over the territory. Therefore, the Chinese government's collection of Dalian Customs duties is certainly not a problem. Article 5 of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of July 6, 1898, which is binding on Japan after 1905, stipulates that China may levy taxes on goods transported from the leased territory into the interior or from the interior into the leased territory on the border. This type of customs should be managed exclusively by the Beijing government. It is ridiculous to say that the Liaodong leased territory is leased to the so-called "Manchukuo." The so-called "Manchukuo" has not even reached the point of factual existence. The land it claims to have jurisdiction over cannot be managed, and it is only a vague political organ. Its actual power is entirely in the hands of Japanese advisors claiming to be employees. This kind of amorphous political organ has not even been recognized by Japan. The attempt by officials of the so-called "Manchukuo" to use Dalian Customs taxes further raises the issue of Japan's treaty obligations and at the same time endangers the integrity of the Chinese customs itself. This fact is one that all countries, both Chinese and foreign, must pay serious attention to. (To be continued) (Reuters on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Whether Li Jishen Will Go to Beiping is Undecided</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Jishen told a reporter from a certain news agency, (1) The Japanese actions against China have completely lost rationality. If one only seeks assistance from other countries or argues with the Japanese, it is like a fool's dream and will be of no help in fact. I believe that we must have the determination to resist for a long time and use the strength of the entire nation to recover our great mountains and rivers. The Northeast Volunteer Army is courageous and commendable, and the people should provide them with considerable assistance to prevent them from being eliminated by the enemy. Wang and others are traveling to Taotao and Beiping this time to work for this matter. Specific methods can be formulated. (2) Whether I will go to Beiping or not will be decided after Wang returns to Beijing. (3) The date of my departure to suppress bandits has not yet been determined. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Jishen said that he highly agrees with Wang's statement in Beiping that if the Communists can work together to overcome the national crisis, the government should abandon its policy of suppressing the Communists. The Northeast is our defense line. If the Northeast is lost, Tianjin and Beijing will be in danger, and the country will be insecure. The most important thing at present is to recover the lost territory in the Northeast. If the Communists can truly repent and work together to overcome the national crisis, the policy of suppressing the Communists can be abandoned. Moreover, I believe that the problem of suppressing bandits is secondary to resisting Japan. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Welcoming the New American Ambassador, Ishii Elaborates on the Monroe Doctrine</h3>
<p>Hints that the United States Should Not Obstruct Japan's Invasion of China</p>
<p>Otherwise, a US-Japan War Will Be Inevitable</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st: The Japan-America Association held a banquet tonight to welcome the new American Ambassador to Japan, Grew. Duke Tokugawa, Prime Minister Saito, former Ambassador to the United States Viscount Ishii, and many other dignitaries attended. Ishii delivered a welcoming speech, stating that rumors have been spreading around the world that armed conflict between Japan and the United States may occur. Knowledgeable people in both countries dismiss this idea as absurd, but continuous malicious propaganda is gradually making people anxious. Such a conflict is of course impossible, but it may occur in two extremely unlikely situations: (1) If Japan presumptuously interferes in affairs in the Western Hemisphere, war will be unavoidable, but the Japanese government and people are not concerned with foreign affairs and are determined not to engage in any event other than peace. (2) If the United States attempts to dominate the Asian continent and obstruct Japan's peaceful and natural development on the Asian continent, the situation will be very serious. However, he knows that the United States is concerned with maintaining peace in the East and respecting treaties, so the aforementioned American intervention is unlikely, just as Japan is unlikely to interfere in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Ambassador Grew replied in his speech, emphatically stating that the United States' interest lies in lasting peace. He said that although the memory of the dark era of 1914-1918 has faded somewhat, the experiences of those years have instilled in the American people a desire to consolidate the structure of international peace in spirit and in fact, so that it will never be changed by time or environment.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 22nd: According to The New York Times, Viscount Ishii's expression of fear that the United States wants to dominate the Far East has not provoked any opposition comments in Washington. The reason is that although Ishii's speech exposed a kind of Asian Monroe Doctrine, his tone was still moderate. Washington officials now believe that Ishii's remarks do not refer to Secretary of State Stimson's note to Japan on June 10, which expressed the United States' concern about the annexation of the Customs of Manchuria, but rather to the progress of the China Incident since last September.</p>
<h3>US Representative Declares Stance that Reparations and Disarmament are Linked</h3>
<p>The General Commission on Disarmament Suddenly Convened Yesterday</p>
<p>The World's Attention Shifts from Lausanne to Geneva</p>
<p>France's Attitude is Key to the Success or Failure of the Conference</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 22nd: The General Commission on Disarmament will meet this afternoon, so that the US Chief Delegate, Gibson, can have the opportunity to state the US attitude on disarmament. The sudden convening of the General Commission was at the special request of the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson. French Prime Minister Herriot, British Prime Minister MacDonald, and German Foreign Minister Neurath, who are currently in Lausanne, will all come here to attend. The United States' sudden intervention in the reparations issue is still the subject of gossip among people in the League of Nations. Even if Gibson does not publicly link disarmament with the reparations issue at today's meeting, it is feared that new, surprising news will occur. It is expected that Gibson will issue a double-edged statement, declaring that the United States hopes that the Disarmament Conference will achieve some real results, and then present the plan that the United States hopes to adopt. It is said that his plan advocates the abolition of all aggressive weapons, a 24% reduction in existing standing armies, and a similar reduction in military and naval expenditures. However, the French side is expected to strongly oppose it, so this plan appears to still lack hope of breaking the deadlock. Furthermore, according to the British delegation, France's firm refusal to make concessions to the United States is sufficient to hinder the preliminary agreement reached between Britain and France on some basic points of reparations and disarmament.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 22nd: At present, the eyes of the masses have shifted from Lausanne to Geneva. Journalists, diplomats, and politicians are now arriving here in an endless stream to participate in today's meeting of the General Commission on Disarmament.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd: It is widely rumored in diplomatic circles today that Secretary of State Stimson has ordered the US Chief Delegate to the Disarmament Conference, Gibson, to inform the European politicians gathered in Geneva that if the outcome of the Disarmament Conference is a failure, then Europe can dispel the illusion that the United States will consider requests for war debts in good faith. Although this statement has been denied, those who spread it speak of it with certainty. Senator Dickinson also said that if the world can truly reduce armaments, we can reorganize international debts. Many view this statement as representative of the general opinion of the Republican Party. Government spokesman Reed also said that we have indeed informed Europe that unless there is real action towards disarmament, empty talk of canceling or reducing war debts will be of no avail.</p>
<h3>US President's Thorough Disarmament Plan</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 22nd: President Hoover proposed reducing world armaments by one-third. His recommendations include: (1) abolishing tanks, chemical warfare methods, and large-caliber mobile cannons; (2) reducing army personnel by one-third; (3) abolishing bomber planes; (4) prohibiting aerial bombardment; (5) reducing the tonnage and number of various warships stipulated in treaties by one-third; (6) reducing the number of aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers stipulated in treaties by one-quarter, and submarines by one-third; (7) no country may possess more than 35,000 tons of submersible vessels.</p>
<h3>France's New Proposals on Disarmament</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 22nd: Today, France submitted a grand proposal regarding civilian and military aircraft to the Disarmament Conference's Sky Committee, advocating the absolute prohibition of aerial, chemical, bacterial, and incendiary warfare. Except for battlefields or aircraft bases and long-range artillery positions, bombing from the air is prohibited. It also proposed stipulating the maximum tonnage (weight without cargo) of each military aircraft, with aircraft exceeding this stipulated tonnage used exclusively for self-defense subject to quotas and under the command of the League of Nations. In addition, it also proposed that mainland commercial air transport should be nationalized. For non-international civilian aircraft, the same basis for stipulating the maximum tonnage per aircraft should be established. A corresponding plan should be established regarding the sale and private manufacturing of weapons. The Canadian representative stood up and argued that this proposal, as far as civilian aircraft are concerned, can be applied to Europe, but is not suitable for large, developing countries such as Canada. The US representative also agreed with this statement, and the discussion was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Japanese Seizure of Customs Duties to be Discussed</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 22nd: Tomorrow, the Chinese representative will raise the issue of the State of Manchuria seizing the customs duties of Dalian.</p>
<h3>Reparations Conference Temporarily Suspends Activities</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 21st: The French and Belgian representatives are currently drafting a joint statement, listing the conditions under which the two countries are prepared to make concessions regarding the revision of the Young Plan. Therefore, the Lausanne Conference temporarily suspended activities today. Only British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Prime Minister Herriot met again tonight, and German Prime Minister Papen also met with Belgian Prime Minister Renkin for a long time. Other representatives also gathered in hotel rooms or public lounges for lengthy discussions. However, as far as is known today, no proposals have been made that can break the deadlock caused by France's refusal to cancel everything. The future of the conference has been further clouded by the disclosure of the results of the secret disarmament conference in the mountain village of Morges between US disarmament representative Gibson and MacDonald and Herriot. To date, no representative of any related country has denied the claim that the secret disarmament conference broke down because Herriot refused to consider the US disarmament plan. It is said that Herriot insisted that France must have adequate security, so it could only consider disarmament in principle, and finally the United States issued a statement similar to a stern ultimatum, resulting in no outcome. It is reported that Gibson made a strong statement that if Europe spends more on armaments than it owes in US debts, the United States cannot consider revising the war debt agreements, and that if it wants the United States to make financial sacrifices, it must first make sacrifices itself. This news has been given great importance here, because US representative Gibson is the first to admit that there is a link between the two issues of disarmament and war debts, so it is considered quite important.</p>
<h3>US Chief Representative Secretly Goes to Lausanne</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 21st: Today, the US Chief Representative to the Disarmament Conference, Gibson, accompanied by Davis, secretly went to Lausanne unexpectedly and secretly discussed with British Prime Minister MacDonald and British Foreign Secretary Simon for an hour. Afterwards, Gibson told reporters, "We talked about disarmament, which is strange, but it is true." According to reports, the two came from Geneva. Once the news spread, everyone speculated that it was related to the development of the reparations conference. However, Gibson told people that if the situation requires it, we may come to Lausanne again, but our visit has nothing to do with the reparations conference. Afterwards, British Foreign Secretary Simon accompanied the US representative back to Geneva. The general opinion now is that although the representatives talked about the statement limited to disarmament, the two's trip is another clear proof that the United States has a tendency to link the war debt issue with disarmament, implying that if European countries show a real intention to disarm, the United States may not be unable to postpone its debt collection. The US government had previously clearly stated that if European countries use the money saved after reducing debts for investment in new weapons of war, the American people will never agree to reduce war debts.</p>
<h3>Stimson Denies Discussing War Debts</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 21st: US Secretary of State Stimson issued a statement today denying the claim that US representatives in Europe discussed the war debt issue in Lausanne or Geneva. European telegrams said that Gibson had told Herriot that the United States was unwilling to consider reducing war debts unless Europe reduced armaments, so the US Secretary of State made this statement.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 21st: After US representative Gibson spoke with President Hoover for a long time via transatlantic telephone, he issued an article discussing the two matters of war debts and disarmament together. Gibson stated that Europe is currently spending more on armaments than it needs to repay its debts to the United States. The idea that if Europe reduces armaments by 10%, the United States may consider reducing debts is gradually being believed by people, and is not extinguished by the news of denial from Washington. Even if this statement has no official basis, many believe that President Hoover actually initiated the statement that if Europe reduces armaments by 10%, the United States can reduce the collection of war debts.</p>
<h3>MacDonald Striving to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 21st: Herriot's insistence on obtaining a guarantee from Germany, especially the German railway bonds, is now the main obstacle in the reparations conference. British Prime Minister MacDonald is currently working hard to overcome this difficulty. This morning, MacDonald and Herriot had a secret conversation for three hours, but no agreement was reached. France has not proposed the issue of suspending the payment of reparations and war debts, but France knows that reparations and war debts are now lifeless. British Foreign Secretary Simon met with French and American representatives in Geneva this morning. It is said that this meeting was of a very important nature, and it is said that after the meeting, some events were telegraphed to Washington for instructions. Simon returned to Lausanne after the meeting to have lunch with MacDonald and report on the consultations with the US and French representatives. Soon after, MacDonald went to meet with US representative Gibson, and as a result, both sides unanimously agreed. MacDonald agreed with the US proposals put forward by Gibson. It is expected that there will be very important developments tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Content of France's New Reparations Plan</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 22nd: Regarding the reparations issue, it is learned that the French representative submitted a plan yesterday, including (1) Germany suspending the payment of reparations for the next three years; (2) the amount of reparations previously determined to be compensated with goods must still be provided; (3) after the expiration of the suspension period, Germany must pay a sum of money, which will be distributed to the United States and other creditor countries in proportion.</p>
<h3>Belgium and France Stand on a Common Front</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 22nd: The Belgian and French representatives at the reparations conference have agreed to stand on a common front regarding the issue of raising reparations. It is even rumored that the two countries have agreed that Germany should ultimately pay 7 to 8 billion marks, but Britain's policy of complete cancellation remains unchanged. A German spokesperson has stated that Germany cannot accept the proposal to issue railway bonds.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Appeals for Inability to Pay</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 22nd: German Foreign Minister Newton sent a letter to MacDonald this morning, reiterating that Germany is unable to continue paying reparations, and said that countries should now take joint action to solve economic problems. As for France's concerns about security, it may be possible to order a consultative provision, so that when security and peace are threatened in any way, Germany can consult with the relevant major powers.</p>
<h3>Split in Japan's Minseito Party</h3>
<p>Adachi Faction Declares Secession</p>
<p>United China News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: The Adachi faction within Japan's Minseito Party jointly requested permission for Adachi to rejoin the party. The executives firmly opposed it, and the Adachi faction's Yamamichi Ichigo organized the Political Research Association, and Koike organized the Policy Research Association, preparing to support Adachi in organizing a new party. Minseito Party leaders held a meeting last night to discuss countermeasures and decided to prevent factionalism within the party. This morning at 10:00, they sent Machida to persuade Yamamichi to cancel the Political Research Association, and Ryuuchi visited Kobashi to persuade the Adachi faction not to act rashly. Other leaders summoned party members to prevent the split. Today's persuasion was ineffective, and more than 20 members of the Adachi faction decided to secede together.</p>
<h3>Chile's Internal Strife Compounded by Earthquake</h3>
<p>Reuters, Santiago, 21st: An earthquake in Chile has caused panic among residents. The loss of life and property is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Reuters, Buenos Aires, 22nd: The successive revolutions and counter-revolutions in Chile in the past half month have caused anxiety among people here, fearing that Chile will establish a military dictatorship. If this is realized, the turmoil will be even greater than it is today. It is heard that civilians are attacking soldiers, which shows that military autocracy is unpopular. More people die in conflicts between soldiers and civilians because the unarmed class fights with the armed class. A fleet is now assembled in Valparaiso, preparing to send marines ashore if necessary.</p>

<h3>Capital Memorial Service for Anti-Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>The capital's various circles held a grand memorial service for the martyred soldiers and civilians who died in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War at the public stadium at 9:00 a.m. on the 22nd. The participants were extremely enthusiastic. Shi Ying, the Mayor of the capital, presided over the ceremony, and representatives from various groups served as assistant officiants. The ceremony was extremely solemn. Details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Assembly:  At the entrances and exits of the venue and at key intersections of nearby streets, simple arches made of pine and cypress were erected. A tall tower was temporarily erected in the large square of Xinjiekou, covered with couplets and plaques, which moved every passerby. A registration desk was set up at the entrance of the venue, distributing promotional materials. Inside the venue, boundaries were designated, and representatives from various sectors, including the party, government, military, agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and women, stood in formation according to a set order. Military police, regular police, and boy scouts maintained internal and external order, which was extremely well-organized. On the altar were placed the memorial tablets of the martyred soldiers and civilians, with offerings of pork, lamb, wine, and incense. The couplets and plaques inside and outside the ceremonial ground, as well as the wreaths and flags presented by various circles, were almost everywhere. A broadcasting machine was placed on the stage, and airplanes soared in the sky, scattering slogans to expand publicity. Nine artillery salutes were fired during the ceremony. All government agencies, organizations, and shops in the city flew flags at half-mast and suspended entertainment for one day to show mourning.</p>
<p>Attendees:  Li Jishen, Chief of Training; Shi Ying, Mayor of Nanjing; Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Fifth Army; all executive and supervisory committee members of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee; officers and soldiers of the 87th Division; representatives from various party, government, and military agencies and agricultural, industrial, commercial, educational, and women's organizations, totaling approximately ten thousand people.</p>
<p>Proceedings of the Meeting:  The meeting began at around 9:00 a.m. After the ritual formalities were completed, Shi Ying, the presiding officiant, first presented a wreath, followed by Huang Tianru, a broadcaster from the Central Radio Station, who read the memorial address. After the reading, Shi Ying, the presiding officiant, gave a report, followed by Huang Hechun, a representative of the 19th Route Army, Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Fifth Army, and a representative from the Military Police Headquarters, who successively reported on the course of the anti-Japanese battles. After the reports, Li Jishen and a representative from the overseas Chinese community gave free speeches. The ceremony concluded at around 11:00 a.m. with the shouting of slogans, and the assembly was dismissed.</p>
<p>Report by the Presiding Officiant:  Shi Ying reported that the significance of today's meeting lies, on the one hand, in deeply respecting the greatness of the spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed for the country, and on the other hand, in continuing the spirit of the martyrs, embracing the determination to sacrifice, and fighting bravely against the powerful enemy. If attending the meeting is seen as a mere formality, and emotions fade after the event, then it would be better not to hold it at all. Although the Japanese troops in Songhu have now retreated, our compatriots in the Northeast are still groaning in pain under the iron heel of the Japanese, unable to free themselves. All of our nation have a responsibility to defend the country. If the Northeast is not recovered for even a day, then the nation's responsibility is not fulfilled for even a day. Recovering lost territory cannot rely on others, because the Japanese rely on their military force, are stubbornly ferocious, and have long abandoned international justice, righteousness, and good faith. There is no other way to survive except to strive on our own. Since the 21st year of the Republic of China, the country has been like a boiling cauldron, and most of the internal strength has been lost in civil wars, giving the Japanese an opportunity to exploit. If we want to save the country in the future, we must have internal unity and solidarity, eliminate suspicion, quell disputes, and work together with the aim of external development. In this way, even though the Japanese are extremely cunning, with the overall spirit and strength of our great nation as a diplomatic backing, we believe that we can resist them and have more than enough strength to do so. Unity is strength, and we hope that the people of the country will strive together.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong's Report:  Today, the capital's various circles are holding a memorial service for the martyred soldiers and civilians who died in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. As a member of the anti-Japanese war, I am deeply saddened to attend this grand gathering. Although this battle was a kind of international war, in reality it was still the beginning of an international war. All our compatriots across the country should fully prepare to participate in the entire national war to win the freedom and liberation of our nation. The most famous battles in this war were the five major battles of Zhabei, Jiangwan, Yunzaobang, Miaoxing, and Liuhang. Among them, the battle of Miaoxing was the fiercest. The casualties on both sides were extremely high. From February 20th to 22nd, the enemy launched an all-out attack, with a force of about 30,000 or more. At that time, the defenders of Miaoxing were one regiment of the 88th Division of the Fifth Army. After bravely resisting, the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. By the time the enemy troops made a general retreat on the 22nd, the two sides had already abandoned artillery bombardment and were completely engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Therefore, most of the wounded officers and soldiers were injured by bayonets and bombs. The scale of sacrifice was too tragic to bear. From this, we can see the brave sacrifice and fearless spirit of our army. The fact that our 19th Route Army and Fifth Army were able to defeat the majority with a minority is also a manifestation of this brave and sacrificial spirit. All our citizens should continue this spirit, defeat the enemy, and eliminate Japanese imperialism. Now that the lost territory in the Northeast has not yet been recovered, our compatriots and armed comrades across the country should recognize that losing the Northeast means losing China. The only way to save this crisis is to risk our lives. The only way to seek survival is to seek survival in death. Only when everyone has the determination to die can we find a way to survive. I dare to represent the entire Fifth Army in reporting to you that the officers and soldiers of the Fifth Army are prepared to shed their last drop of blood and risk their lives for the country. I hope that all circles will also have this spirit and proceed together.</p>
<p>Li Jishen's Speech:  Today, at this memorial service for the martyred soldiers, I, in my personal capacity, will say a few words. The presiding officiant said just now that the memorial service for the martyred soldiers should not be considered complete just by holding a meeting. The intention is nothing more than to comfort the dead and encourage those who come after. In my opinion, the dead are extremely glorious and have died well, so there is no need to comfort them. What is to be mourned is us, the survivors. The Northeast problem has not yet been resolved, and the suffering in the future will be profound. A few days ago, I went to Lushan to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the Northeast incident. Representative Gu, who has returned from the Northeast this time, said that the situation in the Northeast is extremely tragic. The most heartbreaking thing is that after the establishment of the puppet state, all secondary schools and above in the Northeast were completely shut down. On the one hand, many primary schools were added, teaching Japanese. After the investigation team arrived in the Northeast, most of those who went to petition were children. Afterwards, an eight-year-old child wrote to the investigation team saying that he did not want to participate in the petition this time, but because of various pressures, if he resisted even slightly, his life would be in danger. From this, we can see a glimpse of the Japanese oppression of the people in the Northeast and the undying spirit of our people in the Northeast. Representative Gu also said that the puppet state plans to train 250,000 troops, lead them into the pass, and attempt to occupy Beiping and Tianjin. The current situation is critical, so he returned to the capital to discuss with the government the active resistance and assistance to the Northeast. In my opinion, if we want to recover the Northeast, we must resist, and we cannot just make empty words. The public, in particular, should express something. The methods are (1) petition the government to actively resist, (2) implement economic resistance, and (3) assist the Northeast Volunteer Army with military pay and ammunition. If we proceed so actively, we can hope to recover the Northeast.</p>
<p>Memorial Address:  On the 22nd day of June in the 21st year of the Republic of China, the various circles of the capital respectfully offer incense, flowers, and clear wine to the spirits of the martyred soldiers and civilians who died in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, saying: Alas, Heaven has afflicted our China! A powerful neighbor lies in wait, scheming and deceitful, violating alliances and betraying trust, willingly leading the barbarians, and wantonly rebelling, invading our Liaoning and Shenyang, and losing important towns, the three northeastern provinces were successively lost, handing them over with folded hands, causing laughter in all directions, borrowing from the enemy to provide weapons and food, how can we forget this great shame and humiliation! Unexpectedly, the Japanese invaders' ambition is not yet exhausted, having gained an inch, they want a mile, the Shanghai Incident broke out, eating away at our superior country, like a long snake and a wild boar, relying on their power, they despised justice, our soldiers, filled with righteous indignation, following the ancient training, not competing in mausoleums, acting quickly and decisively, rolling up their sleeves and rising up, launching a major offensive, punishing the island barbarians, fighting bravely in the public war, vowing to eliminate the ugly prisoners, hoping that the time will come to die together with you, entering death and emerging into life, amidst the smoke of gunpowder and rain of bullets, fighting hand-to-hand and sacrificing themselves, resisting the enemy, our army is brave and fierce, unparalleled since ancient times, fame shaking Korea and Fan, making the enemy's courage cold, regarding death as returning home, China and foreign countries are amazed, meritorious service to the country, indelible in the annals of history, there are also compatriots who have suffered miserably in the chaos of the world, abandoning their homes and families, their wives and children scattered, fleeing in vain, often encountering difficulties, what is their sin against heaven, the people suffer unspeakably, alas, all these heroic spirits are national martyrs, the Yangtze River is vast, Zhongshan is magnificent, summoning souls and offering sacrifices, the hearts of all people are wounded, if your spirits are aware, accept this cup of wine, alas, enjoy the offering.</p>
<p>Funeral Couplets:  A Collection:  You gentlemen struggled for the nation, destroyed your bodies and sacrificed your lives. How can we bear to see our compatriots collect your heroic bones? May our party remember the national hatred, lie in wait and taste bitterness, and must also avenge the humiliation to comfort your loyal souls. (Chiang Kai-shek) Your crimson blood shines, and your dedication is a model. Your extraordinary achievements are recorded, and your righteous spirit lasts forever. (Central Executive Committee) Tragic drums sound, hurting at the edge of Huangpu River.  Desolate robes of comrades in arms.  The spirits of the loyalists are mourned at the Stone City. (He Yingqin) Take away the awe in one battle.  To fortify our border.  A thousand autumns of immortality. To commiserate the national martyrs together. (Tang Shengzhi) Clowns skip around wildly.  Relying on them charging like wild boars and running like wolves. Cut Shanghai and clip Song to spy on the party and state. The stars should be in operation. Mourning our brave and fierce generals. Red hearts and green blood cleanse the mountains and rivers. (Chen Jicheng) Righteous spirit strengthens the mountains and rivers, hold dry arms, defend the country, take righteousness and become benevolence, let the violent bones be on the sandy ground, win fame and shine in the green history, the spirit shines on the sun and moon, protect the nation, support the Shenzhou, sacrifice to save the country, painfully summoning souls at midnight, empty will tears cry on the Yellow Springs. (Central Military Academy) Ninety thousand miles exhausted the raging waves, the Central Plains had early land subsidence, twenty years of unjust war, the last period waved against the Japanese army. (Military Senate) Holding back the raging waves, as a pillar in the middle of the stream, breathing in foreign invaders, raising the voice of the great Han. (Li Jishen) The disaster is felt, the death is a heroic spirit, the Huangpu River tide smells of war blood, sincerity recommends orchids and chrysanthemums, the ceremony is grand, and the winds and rains of Baimen hang loyal souls. (Ju Zheng) Only struggle can survive, looking up to the martyrs, countless heroic souls, overseas Chinese compatriots shed tears together, non-combatants are also in distress, condemn Japanese slaves, the crimes of five continents, all human beings are the same enemy.

<h3>Puppet Police of Harbin Arrest German Reporter</h3>
<p>American and German reporters visited Ma Zhanshan with difficulty</p>
<p>After returning to Harbin, they were suspected by the Japanese side</p>
<p>Linde was arrested and Steele escaped</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence:  Before the League of Nations investigation team came to the Northeast, many European and American journalists came to Harbin to work because they attached importance to the Northeast issue. Among them, there were those who were loyal to their duties and reported the actual situation to their institutions. However, there were also those who were supported by the Japanese side, receiving subsidies from special agencies or the Kwantung Army and being directed by others. Among the famous journalists who sent news telegrams from Harbin were Hand of the Chicago Tribune, Fleet of the New York Times, and Henry of the Chicago Evening Post. Fleet and Henry received 300 gold tickets per month from special agencies, completely promoting favorable news for the Japanese side, becoming Japanese-ized news reporters. Laycock was controlled by the Kwantung Army Headquarters of Japan and also received 300 gold tickets per month. However, although he received subsidies, he sometimes took into account the reputation of his institution and was unwilling to send too much news that was excessively favorable to Japan. The person most dreaded and helpless by the Japanese side was Hand of the Chicago Tribune. This gentleman had been working in Harbin for nearly three months, seeking truth in his newsgathering. In addition to supplying the Chicago Tribune, he also supplied news to the New York News Agency. The quantity and quality of the news he sent were also the most. Although the Japanese side tried their best to contact him and promised him subsidies, Hand was unmoved. The Japanese, unable to do anything else, sent a specialist proficient in English to the radio station to specifically check Hand's telegrams. Knowing that the Japanese were checking, Hand personally sent telegrams to the bureau every day, watched the receiving, dispatching, and bookkeeping, and went to the radio station the next day to retrieve the bottom of the newspaper for inspection to see if his telegram had been withheld. The Japanese harbored hypocritical behavior towards the outside world. Therefore, sometimes they checked Hand's telegrams, knowing that they were dissatisfied, but they were finally forced to send them. When the League of Nations investigation team came to Harbin, Hand went to see Lytton at the Modern Hotel. When he came out, the Japanese side directed the puppet police to arrest him. Hand repelled them with his fists, but was eventually captured by dozens of people working together, detained overnight, and released the next day through negotiations with the US consulate. From then on, he worked as usual. The Japanese then tried to find a pretext to have the puppet state expel him and strictly restricted the activities of European and American journalists. During this period, German journalist Linde and American journalist Steele suddenly visited Ma Zhanshan with difficulty. The Japanese side suspected that the two journalists had other roles and, under the pretext of being familiar with the military intelligence of the puppet state and reporting it to Ma Zhanshan, directed the puppet police to arrest them, causing concern in the European and American news circles. This also proves the Japanese hatred of European and American journalists.</p>
<p>Linde was a special correspondent for the German World News and a correspondent for various magazines in Geneva. Steele was a special correspondent for the New York Times. The two came to Harbin last month with the League of Nations investigation team. After Lytton and others went to Peiping, the two stayed in Harbin and did not leave. Because Chinese and foreign newspapers publicized the bravery of General Ma Zhanshan, the two agreed to meet secretly. On May 24, they disguised themselves as hunters and set off on foot towards Huhuai Road with a certificate from the US consulate. After more than ten days of trekking, they even encountered bandits, but were exempted as news reporters. Some people also pointed out the location of General Ma. In order to cross the Japanese defense line, the two detoured around Huhuai Road and went to Hailun and Suihua. At the beginning of this month, they finally met Ma in Tonghe Town, northwest of Hailun. Because Ma was busy with military affairs, the two followed his traveling camp and moved with him three or four times. They also met and talked with Ma several times, learning everything about Ma's reasons for resisting Japan, the inside story of the puppet state, and the Japanese conspiracy. On the 11th of this month, they returned to Harbin from Wangkui via Anda Station. The round trip took seventeen days, and they were exhausted from the journey. The Japanese side had paid close attention to the two after they secretly left Harbin. In fact, no one except the US consulate knew about their whereabouts. Therefore, it was rumored for a while that the two were missing. The French consulate even entrusted the Japanese side to help find them. When they returned, the Japanese side learned that they had returned from Hailun and suspected that they were on a mission from the League of Nations investigation team to see Ma Zhanshan. Therefore, they instructed Japanese and Russian (White Russian) journalists to surround them and inquire about their meeting with Ma Zhanshan. The two journalists refused to tell them. As a result, the Japanese side became even more suspicious. On the 16th of this month, they again instructed the puppet state's special police investigation bureau to send personnel to the Modern Hotel to arrest the two. Steele had already taken refuge in the US consulate. Only Linde was in the room, so he was arrested. When asked why he met Ma Zhanshan, Linde said that he had a record of the conversation in the hands of American journalist Hand and sent it to the US consulate for translation. He was ordered to ask for it for a look. After urging by telephone, the US consulate refused to send it for inspection. The Japanese side then decided to ban Linde for breaking through the defense line of Manchuria and leaking military secrets and demanded that the US consulate extradite Steele. The US consulate refused. That afternoon, French Consul Hanna heard the news. Because Linde was Swiss and protected by the French consulate, he went to the puppet police station to demand his release, saying that the puppet state of Manchuria had not been recognized by the great powers, the extraterritorial rights had not been revoked, and foreigners could not be detained. The police station did not reply. The French consul then sat in the investigation bureau and refused to leave until Linde was released. The Japanese side, fearing that it would cause problems, ordered the investigation bureau to release Linde that evening, and the French consul escorted him back. However, because Steele had documents in his possession, they considered it important and were still demanding extradition from the US consulate. Currently, many European and American journalists have come to Harbin from Tianjin to inquire about this matter, which may become a noteworthy incident in the future. (Evening of the 16th)</p>
<h3>Headquarters of the Three Provinces for Bandit Suppression in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei to be Established in Hankou</h3>
<p>Cao Haosen Appointed Chief of Staff</p>
<p>He Chengjun and Others Have Returned to Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence:  Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Commission and Commander-in-Chief of the Three Provinces for Bandit Suppression in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, convened a bandit suppression meeting in Lushan. Military and political figures from Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces were summoned to attend. A general decision has been made on the bandit suppression plan, political facilities, and diplomatic and financial policies. Now, the headquarters of the Three Provinces for Bandit Suppression has decided to be established in Hankou. Chiang Kai-shek will come to Hankou within a week or so. The post of Chief of Staff of the headquarters will be concurrently held by Cao Haosen, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Military Administration. Before Chiang Kai-shek arrives in Hankou, everything will be handled by Cao Haosen. He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, Zhu Huaibing, Li Shucheng, and others, together with Geng Bozhao, a military attache of the National Government, and Xiao Xuan, a member of the Control Yuan, went down the mountain on the 20th. They boarded the Jianghe Wheel and arrived in Hankou at 12:00 noon on the 21st. The Chairman of Hunan, He Jian, will remain in Lushan for two or three days before going down the mountain to Hankou and returning to Changsha. I recently visited He Chengjun. According to his conversation, I left Lushan for eight days and attended a total of three meetings. Chiang Kai-shek only attended once. The rest were taken care of by Minister He Jingzhi and me. In addition to the meetings, Chiang also separately summoned the military commanders of the five provinces to inquire about everything. At the meeting, the principles of various civil administration and construction issues related to bandit suppression have been decided. Regarding the military force issue, it has been decided to increase troops to Hubei. As for military expenditure, Chiang Kai-shek has agreed to increase it. Minister He has decided to go down the mountain today (21st) and return to Nanchang for a trip before going to the capital to discuss this matter with President Jiang and Minister Song. How much will be increased will be decided after Minister He arrives in the capital. On the one hand, military expenditure will be increased, and on the other hand, it will be strictly forbidden for the bandit suppression troops to requisition food or raise funds locally. The remnants of bandits in Anhui Province have been dealt with and are no longer a problem. The Kuang Jixun bandit group has been rampaging in the area bordering southern Henan, eastern Hubei, and Anhui Province. When the three provinces implement joint suppression, the army will naturally be able to quell them. The remnants of the He Duan bandits in central Hubei are currently being suppressed by the Tenth Army and the Sichuan Army. The Sichuan Army is also working hard in the Qianjiang area. As long as military expenditure can be solved, the Red bandits will be easily suppressed. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is currently staying in Guling due to illness and taking a rest. He will come to Hankou soon. The headquarters has decided to be established in Hankou. Whether the temporary headquarters will be established in Bengbu is still undecided. After arriving in Hankou, he will be stationed for a considerable period of time before going elsewhere. As for the report that a pacification office has been established in the seventeen counties of southern Jiangxi, with Xie Yuanhan as the commissioner, I did not hear about it when I was in Lushan. It should not be the case. (June 21st)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce on Methods for Jiangsu Financial Contributions and Standards</h3>
<p>Opposes the Collection of Special Business Tax</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members in Zhenjiang at 3:00 p.m. on the 21st to discuss the Jiangsu provincial business tax and financial matters. Seventeen people, including Wang Jingting, attended. The meeting was opened by Chairman Yu Xiaochuan, who said that in response to the federation's request to stop the special business tax and abolish the preparatory staff, the Department of Finance replied that if the federation could raise two million yuan before the 22nd of this month, all problems could be solved. Otherwise, to maintain the locality and meet military pay needs, the collection office would have to be implemented from July 1st. How should the federation respond? Please decide on the case. The following resolutions were unanimously adopted: (1) The federation cannot disregard the laws and regulations of the provincial government in implementing the special business tax and recognize it. (2) Since the implementation of the special business tax is not permitted by laws and regulations, the Department of Finance's request to borrow two million yuan as an exchange condition for stopping the special business tax is fundamentally untenable. (3) To relieve the financial difficulties of the province, divide the temporary and permanent methods. The temporary method: A. On the principle that the business tax should be stopped and the business license tax should be levied instead, as stipulated in the outline ordered by the ministry, the tax rate should not exceed 2/10. After the business license tax is opened, merchants are willing to prepay the tax for one quarter within one month. B. Revamp two months of rent throughout the province, which can collect tens of thousands of yuan. The permanent method: Please ask the Department of Finance to quickly convene the local elders, silver houses, and chambers of commerce in the province to form a Jiangsu Provincial Financial Discussion Committee to solve the province's financial problems, and please establish a budget discussion meeting for the 21st year. (4) Request Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to stop Jiangsu Province from implementing the special business tax. (5) The Standing Committee shall mutually elect three standing committee members to contact the Department of Finance. (6) Recommend three standing committee members and Wu Minyu, Feng Qingxuan, Zhang Shouyi, Zhang Tianmin, and other seven executive and supervisory committee members as representatives to petition in the capital. (7) Based on the resolution of the congress, the federation shall organize a tax law discussion committee with seven members, who shall be nominated by the Standing Committee and submitted to the next executive committee for retroactive recognition. (8) The federation's opposition to the special business tax and the process of stopping the business tax and levying the business license tax instead shall be printed and distributed to various chambers of commerce for general information.

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Newspaper Sued Case Opens in Court: Since the end of last year, local newspapers in this county have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The establishment of the Yunjian Daily, Song Pao, and Yunjian Business Daily has been quite popular among the local circles. The three newspapers recently published a love story about Ms. Jin Shimin, a teacher at a certain girls' school in Zhangyan. Afterwards, a letter from a teacher named Yao from the same school was published to correct it. However, Ms. Jin believed that her reputation had been damaged and repeatedly asked the newspaper offices for the original manuscript, which was refused. She then filed a self-prosecution with the county court, accusing Zhang Xinggong, the manager and chief writer of the Yunjian Daily, Zhang Jiecai, the president of the Song Pao, and Zhang Polang, the chief writer of the Yunjian Business Daily, of defamation. The court opened at court today (22nd) afternoon. Judge Wang Sixian was raised to be tried. Plaintiff Jin Shimin stated the reasons for the self-prosecution. Except for Zhang Polang who did not arrive, the consultants of Yunjian Daily and Song Pao, lawyers Peng Zhongjun and Liu Zhimou, appeared in court to defend. After the judge took the statements of both parties, he instructed them to go out and try to reconcile, otherwise he would set another date for trial. The court adjourned. This case has attracted much attention from the community, and there were quite a lot of people in the audience. The plaintiff, Jin Shimin, was dressed fashionably and spoke eloquently, expressing that she must see the original manuscript.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Locomotive Engineer Dies in Fall: At around 2:00 AM on the 22nd, a night express train from Nanjing to Shanghai arrived at the Wuxi station. The train's engineer, Zhang Zaozheng, a Shanghai native in his thirties, got off the train to check the temperature of the boiler under the engine. He accidentally lost his footing just as he reached the front of the engine, fell onto the tracks, his brains splattered, and he died instantly. The assistant engineer reported the incident to Stationmaster Cao, who immediately prepared a coffin for burial. A letter was also sent to Shanghai to inform the deceased's family to come to Wuxi to claim the coffin for burial.</p>
<p>Organizing a Disaster Relief Committee: Wuxi has been affected by last year's floods, and this year's silkworm harvest has been poor. The rural economy in the countryside has fallen into bankruptcy, so the tide of rice riots occurs several times a day. If relief measures are not taken, the situation will inevitably become unmanageable. Yesterday, Li Tiping of the County Party Headquarters and Qian Sunqing of the Chamber of Commerce, together with the County Government and various agencies and groups, organized a temporary disaster relief committee, dividing it into fundraising, investigation, and general affairs sections. It was decided to convene a council meeting of urban and rural gentry on the 26th to actively handle relief efforts.</p>
<p>Strictly Pursuing Short-Paid Rent Donations: The county government previously received an order from the province to collect two months of rent donations. The County Public Security Bureau and the Finance Bureau were ordered to send personnel to collect donations from each household, collecting a total of over 30,000 silver dollars. Subsequently, an order was received from the province stating that the Provincial Security Team urgently needed funds and ordered the allocation of 20,000 silver dollars from the collected funds. 12,000 silver dollars had already been allocated. Yesterday, another telegram was received from the Department of Finance ordering the immediate allocation of the remaining 8,000 silver dollars, without delay, to avoid delaying military pay. The Public Security Bureau was strictly ordered to expedite the collection and to allocate all remaining funds for emergency use, with no further delays permitted.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>District Chief Accused of Illegally Selling Farmland: Cai Qijin of Chaqijin, Dushan Port, Third District of Shazhou, was murdered last month. His brother, Cai Liujin, accused Cai Qijin's wife and son of murder. The county sent an examiner, Wang Cheng, to the countryside to open the coffin for an autopsy. Afterwards, the Third District Chief, Wang Wenkui, and the District Assistant, Han Jinming, etc., due to the considerable expenses for the autopsy, arrested the village head Chen Wangsen and ordered</p>
<p>Cai Xiaogen, the neighbor of Cai Qijin's family, and the monk Lu and others, to illegally sell seven and a half mu of farmland belonging to Cai Qijin's family, obtaining 185 silver dollars, which they divided among themselves. Cai Qijin's three sons became beggars. Chen Songshan and others reported this to the county. On the afternoon of the 20th, Wang Wenkui and others were summoned to court. Examiner Wang Cheng interrogated them for three hours. The evidence was conclusive. The court ruled that Wang Wenkui, Han Jinming, Gu Zuzhi, and others, as public officials, forged private documents and colluded to illegally sell the farmland of orphans, and should bear criminal responsibility. They were ordered to be detained, and a sentencing date was set. The plaintiffs, Chen Songshan and others, were ordered to return home.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Sending Personnel to Re-seal Anti-Japanese Goods: Recently, merchants such as Yiyantang in the Wuyi silk and foreign goods industry secretly unsealed and publicly sold anti-Japanese goods, and the guild charged 17.5 yuan per thousand yuan. The County Party Headquarters sent personnel to thoroughly investigate. The Anti-Japanese Association convened a meeting on the 21st and decided that the anti-Japanese goods that had been privately unsealed would be re-sealed by personnel from the County Party Headquarters, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Anti-Japanese Association. Wang Haibei would thoroughly investigate the guild's fees. The Southern Goods Industry and the Jingguang Foreign Goods Industry had not privately unsealed goods and did not need to be reinvestigated. It was requested that the County Party Headquarters immediately unseal and publicly sell the goods in accordance with provincial regulations to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<p>Military Police Search Wounded Soldiers' Hospital: Recently, incidents of bandits in military uniforms robbing people have occurred repeatedly inside and outside Wuyi. Huang Gu, the brigade commander of the 155th Brigade stationed in the area, was furious upon hearing the news. On the morning of the 21st, he cooperated with the public security organs and sent teams to search the wounded soldiers' hospitals at Tianning Temple and the County Confucian Temple. Subsequently, they inspected shacks and hotels in the eastern part of the city. As a result, eight suspects, including Chen Shangwu, were arrested and sent to the brigade headquarters for interrogation.</p>

The original accusers, Gong Weifan and others, have also organized a committee to investigate the Dong case to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Bridge Collapses, Crushing Troop Boat: After the troops stationed in Zhapu were transferred, a unit of the 81st Division was transferred from Jiaxing to fill the defense.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, a troop boat sailed out of Jiaxing, carrying more than 100 rifles, two small steel cannons, three officers, and several soldiers. When the boat passed through the territory of Haiyan County, the boat entered the bridge opening. The bridge suddenly collapsed, and the entire boat sank into the river. The tugboat that was pulling it quickly cut the towline and was fortunately unharmed. The military authorities have now detained the people on the tugboat for investigation. The officers have not been salvaged for a long time and are not expected to survive.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Shen Xingnong and Son Kidnapped: In Shangmu, near Linghu in the southern part of Zhejiang, Shen Xingnong, a farmer, has a modest fortune, which attracted the attention of bandits. More than 20 bandits speaking various dialects broke through the wall and robbed a large amount of property, including more than 40 carts of raw silk, more than 40 pieces of silk fabric and clothing. Before leaving, they kidnapped Shen Xingnong and his son Anren.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Business Tax Reduction Measures: Zhejiang's finances have been extremely difficult in recent years. Last year, the likin tax was abolished and replaced with a business tax, but the annual revenue was only 1.05 million, far from the budget. In order to remedy the financial situation, the central government approved the increase of the business tax to 10 per mille across the board. However, the merchants of the province strongly opposed it and repeatedly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to order the province to withdraw the order. They also petitioned the provincial government, which submitted it to a meeting for discussion. Yang Mianzhong, Wang Chengying, and Zeng Yangfu, three provincial committee members, were appointed to re-examine the matter with Zhou Junyan of the Department of Finance. After several consultations, it was decided to reduce the business tax on wholesale to 5 per mille and to classify the business tax on retail, with heavier taxes on items such as cosmetics and consumables. The principle was to take into account the difficulties of the merchants and to ensure that the government's finances and overall budget were not affected. Although the merchants strongly requested the withdrawal of the order, they expressed acceptance of a slight increase compared to last year in order to take the overall situation into consideration. However, they believed that the government's proposal was still too far from their expectations and were unwilling to acknowledge it.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Change of Commissioner of the Changhuai Public Security Bureau: The Changhuai police administration has been corrupt for a long time, and successive commissioners have failed to make effective reforms. Therefore, there is no security to speak of on the water. The previous commissioner, Lu Fengshu, resigned after serving for more than a year due to financial difficulties. The provincial government of Anhui approved his resignation and appointed Wang Xianyou as his replacement. Lu immediately began the handover process, and Wang arrived at the bureau at 10:00 AM on the 21st to take office.</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>A Word to Those Advocating the Resumption of Relations with Russia - Chen Qitian</h3>
<p>And a Question for Shen Bao Reporter Chen Binhe (Continued)</p>
<p>However, Mr. Chen's reply was not like this. Mr. Chen said, "In 1927, our country severed relations with the Soviet Union. The government's reason was that "the Soviet Union instigated and participated in the Communist Party's riots, undermining the National Revolution, and had to take decisive action." The Sino-Soviet Conflict of 1929, was "also something that should not have happened," as the Ta Kung Pao said (see the editorial of May 19, "On the Resumption of Relations with Russia"). However, the increasing strength of the Communist Party in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian in recent years has occurred after the severance of relations with the Soviet Union. In the Northeast, consuls were still exchanged with the Soviet Union after 1927, but the Communist Party's strength in the Northeast is not as great as in the South. Therefore, we must admit that the policy of severing relations with the Soviet Union to prevent and contain the Communist Party has completely failed. Therefore, it can be said that the severance of relations was anti-Soviet, but it cannot be said that it was to prevent communism. The fact has proven that the severance of relations has failed to prevent communism."</p>
<p>As for the question of "whether these conditions have been resolved now that the resumption of relations is being advocated," it is also unnecessary to waste words to answer. In 1927, the British Conservative Party cabinet made a mountain out of a molehill and severed relations with the Soviet Union on the pretext of the so-called "Arcos raid." When the British Labour Party regained power in 1929, it immediately resumed relations. Was it impossible to prevent the propaganda of "redification" during the Conservative Party cabinet era, but there were no reservations during the Labour Party cabinet era? Conversely, did the Conservative Party cabinet's severance of relations with the Soviet Union truly eliminate the propaganda of communism in Britain? Therefore, we can say that the severance of relations was anti-Soviet, but it cannot be said that it was to prevent communism. This is a matter of inevitable reason."</p>
<p>After reading the above paragraph of Mr. Chen's reply, we cannot but ask Mr. Chen: The so-called Sino-Soviet Conflict of 1929 certainly included both the severance of relations and the war. The raid on the Harbin Russian consulate was only the cause of the Sino-Soviet Conflict. The result of the raid was the discovery of evidence of the Soviet Union's conspiracy to redify China, which was clearly contrary to the Sino-Russian Agreement. It cannot be said that it "should not have happened." If it is said that the Chinese raid should not have happened, then is it appropriate for the Soviet Union to use its consuls to promote redification in China? If Mr. Chen says that my so-called "should not have happened" refers to the severance of relations with Russia, then I tell Mr. Chen that China's formal severance of relations with Russia was in 1927. The Sino-Soviet Conflict of 1929 was not a severance of relations with Russia again, but rather Russia declared the severance of relations with China first as the opening salvo of the armed invasion of the Northeast. This was Russia's declaration of war on China. Why do you say that China "should not have happened"? Mr. Chen misrepresents the facts, being harsh on others and lenient on himself. This is not allowed in international relations. Mr. Chen uses the fact that "the Communist Party's strength in the Northeast is not as great as in the South" to prove that "the policy of severing relations with the Soviet Union to prevent and contain the Communist Party has completely failed." The reason is also insufficient. Because Russia's plan to redify China is defensive in the Northeast and offensive in the South. The Northeast has the opposing forces of Japan and Russia. If the redification starts in the Northeast first, it will inevitably cause a direct struggle between Japan and Russia, which is not in line with Russia's overall diplomatic strategy. This is one reason why the Communist disaster in the South is greater than in the Northeast. The Kuomintang once allied with Russia and tolerated the Communist Party. Therefore, the Communist Party's strength followed the Kuomintang from south to north. The Kuomintang's strength almost never reached the Northeast. So the Communist Party's strength in the Northeast is not as great as in the South. This is another reason. The southern provinces where the Communist Party's strength is greatest, such as Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, and Fujian, are all within the sphere of influence of the Nanjing government, and the Nanjing government's political corruption and the mixture of troops are actually above the Northeast. This</p>
<p>is the third reason why the South is stronger than the Northeast. Understanding these reasons, it cannot be said that the great strength of the bandits in the South is sufficient to prove that the policy of severing relations to prevent communism has failed. It can only be said that due to the alliance with Russia, the poisoning was too deep, the severance of relations was too late, and prevention was impossible. After the severance of relations, there was no effort to eliminate the bandits, and anti-Japanese riots were created day by day, giving the Communist bandits an opportunity to develop, resulting in the current irreversible situation. If relations are immediately resumed, it will help the Communist bandits, which will definitely be even more impossible to approach.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Chen's opinion that "whether these conditions have been resolved now that the resumption of relations is being advocated," he believes that "it is unnecessary to waste words to answer." From my point of view, the so-called "unnecessary to waste words" answer is obviously an answer that cannot be worded. As Mencius said, "A fugitive word knows its poverty." Mr. Chen can be considered to have fled, fleeing from China to England. What Zeng asked was whether China's current resumption of relations with Russia has resolved these conditions, not what England's situation is. China and England have different situations. The fact that England resumed relations with Russia cannot be sufficient evidence that China can also resume relations with Russia. Let me give an analogy first. For example, Zhang San is a strong man, and Li Si is a sick man with many holes and sores. Zhang San can wade through water and climb mountains, facing the wind and bathing in the rain. Li Si should only live in the hospital and slowly recuperate. If someone insists on persuading Li Si to learn from Zhang San to wade through water and climb mountains, facing the wind and bathing in the rain, and asks questions to encourage him, saying, "Zhang San can wade through water and climb mountains, why can't you Li Si? Zhang San can face the wind and bathe in the rain, why can't you Li Si?" If Li Si truly believes this person's encouragement, I think Mr. Chen will definitely say that Li Si misunderstood what people said and will definitely die soon. Zhang San can be said to be England, and Li Si can be said to be China. England is a healthy and developed Western power, and China is a sick man with external injuries and internal damage. England's politics have long been on the track of democracy, and China's politics are still on the road of party rule. The British army belongs to the state and the public, while the Chinese army is still privately owned by warlords. The British people live a rich life, while the Chinese people live a poor life. England has not suffered the disaster of allying with Russia, while China has long been poisoned by allying with Russia. There are very few Communists in England, and they have no armed forces. There are many Communist bandits in China, and they already have great armed forces. Russia's diplomacy with England is a defensive strategy, while its diplomacy with China is an offensive strategy. From these different situations, it can be determined that whether England resumes relations with Russia or not is insufficient to prove that China can also resume relations with Russia. England can resume relations with Russia or not, and it is insufficient to affect England's foundation. However, China's immediate resumption of relations with Russia not only cannot obtain guaranteed benefits, but instead suffers the harm of helping the Communist bandits and shaking the foundation of the country. So what is the point? Therefore, judging from China's current situation, anti-Russia is a method of preventing communism. The severance of relations is not only anti-Russia, but also prevents communism. This is a "necessary reason." Mr. Chen's "view is not too leftist?"</p>
<p>Mr. Chen also believes that there are still methods to prevent communism and silence those who oppose the resumption of relations, saying,</p>
<p>"Diplomatic relations can be restored, and the propaganda of communism can be stopped through legitimate means of negotiation. These two things cannot be discussed as one."</p>
<p>Although the resumption of relations and the prevention of communism cannot be completely discussed as one, when resuming relations, it is necessary to consider whether there are methods to prevent communism, so as not to help communism by resuming relations. On this point, Mr. Chen tells us that "legitimate means can be used for negotiation and prevention." I want to ask what the so-called "legitimate means" are. According to international practice, of course, it is nothing more than treaties or agreements, etc. It is definitely not based on oral statements. The Sino-Soviet Agreement of 1924 already had the following provisions:</p>
<p>"Article VI The two contracting governments mutually guarantee that within their respective territories, there shall be no existence and actions of various agencies or groups formed for the purpose of opposing the other government by violence, and promise not to engage in propaganda contrary to the public order and social organization of the other country."</p>
<p>This provision clearly says that the Soviet Union is not allowed to propagate communism in China. However, the fact of the past eight years is that the Communist Party was established by Russia, and Russia in China not only has communist propaganda that is contrary to China's public order and social organization, but also opposes the Chinese government by violence. Therefore, the agreement has become waste paper. Having negotiations is the same as having no negotiations. China wants to stop it, Russia wants to propagate it. The so-called "legitimate means" have already had such an effect. Can they still be trusted?</p>
<p>Mr. Chen could not give us a satisfactory answer to the above point, and did not say much about the relationship between resuming relations with Russia and helping communism, but especially placed his argument on the "soil of China's current situation is most suitable for communism," saying</p>
<p>"The focus of the problem lies in whether our country is suitable for the soil of communism and whether there are opportunities to allow communism to spread. If there are, what is the benefit of severing relations? If there are none, what is the harm of resuming relations? Putting aside the fundamental question, but wanting to use a closed-door policy to prevent the inflow of communism, alas, if things have already rotted, even if they are placed in an iron box, can they be guaranteed not to breed worms?</p>
<p>"If it is said, "Our country does not have a strong and unified government," "strict social organization," "stable people's lives," "no grasp of controlling communism," therefore, it is not allowed to follow in the footsteps of the great powers and open the door, allowing "the conspirators of red terror" to enter and exit freely, then we have already recognized that our country is the most suitable soil for communism. Since our country has this soil, even if there is no Soviet Union in the world, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no revolutionary facts. The historical turmoil can be examined. Without repairing internal affairs and stabilizing people's livelihood, but wanting to use the severance of relations with the Soviet Union as a means of preventing the budding of chaos, the view is not too leftist?

<p>Educational News Main Points</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Department of Education Orders Strict Prohibition of Private Sale of School Property</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued instructions to the county governments of various counties, stating that property centralization can enable adjustment of surpluses and deficits, and unified authority can enable smooth command. The education property of various counties is either managed by the school authorities or by local individuals on behalf of the county. The methods are extremely inconsistent, and inspection is difficult. If this continues, not only will the economy forever feel chaotic, but the efficiency of education will inevitably be reduced as a result. In view of this, the Department has specially formulated measures for centralized property and rectified rent collection, and issued the order No. 194 of the Ministry of Education for compliance. However, it has recently been heard that a small number of people managing school property on behalf of the county intend to sell the property they manage on behalf of the county at reduced prices. If this is true, it is extremely illegal. For this reason, a circular is issued to strictly prohibit it. If the above-mentioned situation is found, those who sell their names should be punished according to law, and those who buy at a price should also be punished with the same crime. The heads of the education bureaus of various counties, if there is negligence or concealment, will be severely punished upon investigation. In addition to separate orders, it is ordered that the county magistrate should announce this to the public, and supervise the county education bureau chief to conduct a strict investigation. This is of utmost importance. This order,</p>

<h3>Records of Knocking on the Bell at the Old Temple (30) (1) Not Removing the Garden Grass, the Tutor</h3>
<p>Thirty-Four</p>
<p>I said, "Fearing ghosts as a child, fearing ghosts for life; this is absolutely true. I fear neither heaven nor earth, not even tigers. Only ghosts – the mere mention of that word makes my hair stand on end. Mr. Zhu! Is there any way to dispel this nighttime terror?"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said, "At your age, I was just as afraid of ghosts. My grandmother, my maternal grandmother, and the relatives and friends around me described no fewer than a dozen ghosts to me. Each one was vivid on their lips and played tricks in my heart, making me shiver and tremble as I stood by. After hearing these stories, I dared not enter a room alone, and I was sure to be startled awake several times in my dreams by something with disheveled hair. The elders did not understand the terror of children. On stormy nights, they still talked about ghosts, scaring us half to death." I interjected, "Are you still afraid now?" Mr. Zhu said, "I'm not afraid now. One summer when I was seventeen, as the sun was setting, I made up my mind to go and see a ghost. My home was sixty miles from the school. Summer vacation was just past the halfway point. I had come to the school during the day to visit friends. I could have stayed overnight at a friend's house, but I wanted to do two experiments: one, to see if I could walk one hundred and twenty miles; and two, to see if there were really any ghosts on the road. So I decided to go home that night. The road passed through many pavilions, and three of them were said to be haunted. I ignored my friends' warnings and set off with a small lantern, a few candles, and a box of matches. After walking for a little over an hour, I saw the first pavilion in the distance and shivered. When I was about ten yards from the pavilion, all my hair stood on end. As I approached the entrance of the pavilion, I fixed my eyes on the exit, closed my eyes, and ran out of the pavilion two steps at a time.</p>
<p>Good heavens! The more I ran, the more terrified I became, as if a ghost was chasing me from behind. After running for several dozen steps, I escaped the ghost's territory and began to question myself: 'What are you doing? Aren't you here to see a ghost? If there is a ghost, can you escape? If there is no ghost, why close your eyes and run?' That's right! I came to see a ghost. When I get to the second pavilion, I must look!' This new resolve gave me a hundredfold increase in courage. When I reached the second pavilion, my hair was still a little raised. But this new resolve called on me to advance boldly. I walked into the pavilion step by step, calmly. When I reached the center of the pavilion, I looked around and saw nothing. Then I walked out with large strides. I walked into and out of the third pavilion in the same way, without even raising my hair. I conquered the ghost! I conquered the ghost in my heart! I conquered the fictitious ghosts that my elders had unintentionally used to scare me for over a decade! I won this victory by charging forward with all my might. If you want to conquer the ghost in your heart, you must also struggle. Only resolve can conquer everything, including ghosts. If we could teach the women in the countryside not to tell children ghost stories anymore, the little ones would have so much less fear, and when they grow up, they wouldn't have to work so hard to fight ghosts like we do."</p>

<h3>National Sports Conference</h3>
<p>丨The venue is in the Livelihood Society Auditorium丨</p>
<p>List of Sports Experts Hired by the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>To be planned and implemented by Wu Linruo after arriving in Beijing</p>
<p>The venue for the National Sports Conference was decided after Preparation Committee member Peng Baichuan personally went to the Livelihood Society on the 21st to discuss with the General Secretary Huang Renlin. Approval was granted to hold the conference in the Society's auditorium, and the Society will be responsible for the food and lodging of the attending members. This arrangement will make the conference more convenient and avoid the trouble of commuting. As for the list of sports experts hired by the Ministry of Education, only a few people were decided at the second preparatory committee meeting. The majority of the remaining sports experts will have to wait until Preparatory Committee member Wu Linruo arrives in Beijing around mid-July to discuss with him in person before a decision can be made. This is because Mr. Wu is a current sports professor and is more familiar with talent in the sports world. With his planning, the conference should proceed more smoothly. At 3:00 PM on the 21st, the preparatory committee for the National Sports Conference held its first meeting at the Ministry of Education Library. Attendees included General Secretary Guo Lianfeng, Document Secretary Huang Longxian, Da Gu Liangjie, Reception Secretaries Shi Wei, Zhang Yuanxun, and Tu Gang. Guo presided over the meeting, which resolved the following: (1) To request Zhou Yongnan and Dai Zefan to design the emblem for the National Sports Conference and complete it within this week; (2) To compile a member handbook, drafted by Weng Zhida and Huang Long, and then handed over to Shi Wei to contact the printing; (3) The conference budget will be reviewed by Tu Gang; (4) Guo Lianfeng and Gu Liangjie will be responsible for organizing the proposals; (5) The venue news will be handled by the venue recorder and the venue reception; (6) To request the Ministry of Finance to allocate 5,000 yuan before July 15 for application;</p>

<h3>Lawn Tennis Match: China Defeats North Lawn</h3>
<p>China Wins All Five Sets with a Score of 15 to 0</p>
<p>丨China to Play South Lawn Rescheduled Match Tomorrow丨</p>
<p>In the joint lawn tennis competition, the China Tennis Club made its first appearance yesterday, competing against the North Lawn of the Race Club at the China Tennis Court. Under the bright sun, spectators flocked to the venue. The Chinese team was well-organized and spirited, winning each set in straight sets. At the end of the five sets, China achieved a complete victory with a score of 15 to 0, setting an unprecedented record for the China Club in the lawn tennis league. The complete defeat of the North Lawn was also unexpected.</p>
<p>The Lin-Zheng Pairing in the First Set: The first Chinese team was Lin Saihua and Zheng Zhaojia. They struggled a bit at the beginning. Errors in serving were frequent for both of them, and their strokes lacked confidence. Starting from the second set, they showed some improvement. Lin Baohua's performance was not particularly impressive. Zheng Zhaojia was mediocre at first, but made some brilliant plays in the third set, earning the praise of the audience. Their opponents were mediocre and showed little outstanding performance. As a result, China won 6-3, 6-0, 6-1. The North Lawn players were LJ Keerden and Nash.</p>
<p>Jiang-Yu's Coordination Lacked Fluency: The second Chinese team was represented by Jiang Daozhang and Yu Tianguang. The battle was quite intense. The opponents were Boss and Gotgen, who showed skill. Jiang Daozhang was a slightly older player, and Yu Tianguang was an emerging talent. However, due to their first-time cooperation, their coordination was lacking, and they sometimes gave way and lost points. As a result, although Jiang and Yu won 8-6, 6-4, and 6-4, it was quite strenuous and was the last set to end.</p>
<p>Tu-Liang on the Same Front: Tu Kaiyuan and Liang Deguang from Guangzhou, were on the third front. Tu's tennis skills are well-known in Shanghai. Liang Deguang was making his debut, and his tennis skills seemed slightly inferior to Yu Tianguang, but he was quite calm. Dealing with the mediocre Geers and Wulai, it was like taking something out of a pocket. Tu and Liang won 6-4, 6-3, and 6-1.</p>
<p>Guo-Wu Team Was the First to Succeed: The first set to end was the fourth set, with Guo Qida and Wu Zhuren against Xituhan Yinyu and B. Keerden. Guo and Wu are good at enduring and showed no temper, so they lost few points. The ball was sometimes far, sometimes near, sometimes high, sometimes low, which made the opponents tired and overwhelmed. At the end of the three sets, Guo and Wu won 6-0, 6-3, and 6-2, which was quite easy.</p>
<p>Feng-Shen's Vigor Did Not Diminish: The fifth Chinese team was composed of veteran Feng Xikang and newcomer Shen Meizhen. Their vigor did not diminish, and they also won in straight sets. The score was 6-4, 6-1, and 6-2. The opponents were Hishum and Bei You. Shen is good at forehand long shots, and General Feng Xikang covered all aspects, which was just right. Moreover, their coordination was quite good.</p>
<p>Will Fight South Lawn Tomorrow: In the first match last Wednesday, the China Club was originally against the South Lawn of the Race Club, but it was stopped due to rain. It is learned that the two clubs will reschedule the match tomorrow (Friday) at 5:00 PM at the China Tennis Court. The South Lawn has famous players such as Hewitt and Stoke, who are not as easy to deal with as the North Lawn. The China Club must be cautious, and there may be hope for a championship in the future.</p>
<h3>World Heavyweight Boxing Championship: American Jake Takes It from the German's Hands</h3>
<p>Jake Wins One More Round Than 15 Rounds Combined</p>
<p>Mack to Make a Comeback Next Year</p>
<p>At Madison Square Garden in Long Island, New York, on the evening of the 21st, two strong rivals faced each other.</p>
<p>The German Mack Schmeling and the American Jake Sharkey, made a World Heavyweight Boxing Championship, fifteen rounds combined, all kinds of shapes were reflected in front of the audience, joys and shocks, laughter and tears were not. Until the end of the war, the referee announced that the American Sharkey had won, and 80,000 people in the field immediately cheered loudly, congratulating him on his success. The global suspense that had been regarded as difficult to resolve for two years has come to an end for the time being.</p>
<h3>(1) Two Heroes Start a War</h3>
<p>Mack's victory in previous years was due to Jake's fouls. It was said that he was lucky. This time, Jake benefited, and the result was only one more round. Then the true skills of the two seem to be on the same level, and it is impossible to distinguish their height. Next year, who knows that Mack will not surpass Jake again?</p>
<h3>Mack Will Make a Comeback</h3>
<p>The German Mack, after a year of comfortable life, has not regressed in his original art. Before the war, the sound of support from the audience was higher than that of Jake, reaching a ratio of six to five. In the course of the fifteen rounds, he showed his tenacious spirit and struggled forward, constantly pressing Jake, causing him to retreat to the side of the fence. Until the end, Jake received a reward for the number of attacks he made. However, some people think that Mack was robbed. According to experts next to the rope, the German won nine rounds, Jake four rounds, and the remaining two rounds were tied. George MacDonson, one of the three referees, gave Mack ten rounds, but the two referees, George O'Kelly and Smith, supported Jake. When the referee announced the champion's name, the audience showed a clear expression of flatness. Mack seemed to see a momentary daze, but soon recovered his old habits, stepped to Jake and shook hands and congratulated him, to show his heroic spirit. Mack's statement to reporters was good, saying that I was not very upset, but Jake was always forced and won, how could this be possible? I will make a comeback, and I can compare my skills again next year.</p>
<p>The current World Heavyweight Boxing Champion, American Jake Sharkey</p>
<h3>Jake Finally Pays Off His Long-Held Wish</h3>
<p>Jake's heartbreak after failing due to a foul is conceivable. However, the days to come will be long, and he will be able to achieve the goal of victory sooner or later. In the past two years, he has devoted himself to hard training, and his indestructible body has been completed, so he went out to compete with Mack again. Therefore, there was a rumor in the boxing world that only Jake can beat Mack, and the American men and women, especially, are concerned. Almost all of them did their best to encourage this only hope of the boxer, to win the championship from the German Mack. At that time, the result of the fifteen rounds was that Jake finally fulfilled his long-held wish, and the ecstasy of the American people can be imagined. Afterwards, when this victorious general slowly left the field, he was surrounded by a large number of spectators, and he could hardly move. Some said that Jake's hardship in getting out of the crowd was like facing Mack.</p>
<h3>(2) The Truth of the War</h3>
<p>The two's record is very average. Jake is heavier, which is not without its advantages. Jake weighs two hundred and five pounds, and Mack weighs one hundred and eighty-eight pounds. In the fifteen rounds, Jake won the first, second, third, sixth, eighth, and fourteenth rounds, a total of six rounds. Mack won the fifth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth rounds, a total of five rounds. The fourth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth rounds were equally divided. The two were seriously injured in this fierce battle. The champion Jake's eyes were swollen and closed. Mack's lips were cracked and bleeding, but neither fell to the ground.</p>
<h3>Jake Gains Strength in the First Half</h3>
<p>First Round: Jake started attacking, hitting Mack's cheek, and then his left and right hands followed. Mack counterattacked and also hit Jake's nose. In the mutual attack, Jake attacked twice, and at the same time, his jaw was also hit once. (Jake won this round)</p>
<p>Second Round: Mack rose up and forced Jake to the side of the rope. Jake waited quietly for the opportunity, hitting Mack's head with his right hand, and then hitting the enemy's ear with his left hand. He also hit the bridge of his nose twice. Mack gained momentum and was hit, not good at using the opportunity. At the end, Mack hit Jake's ear. (Jake won this round)</p>
<p>Third Round: Jake opened his hand first and hit the cheek. Mack retaliated with a heavy punch. Afterwards, the two looked at each other's nose as the goal, and each hit once. After a few moments, Mack hit again three times. (Jake won this round)</p>
<p>Fourth Round: The German hit the face first, and the American also gave a considerable counterattack. After that, they attacked each other, and there was no advantage for either side. At the end, Jake suddenly lowered his hand and hit the lower part of the person. Mack took it without flinching. This move attracted the attention of the public, because two years ago, Jake failed because of this foul. Moreover, the New York Boxing Commission recently passed a bill saying that if a person falls to the ground due to a lower body attack, he must stand up and continue fighting, otherwise the attacker will be judged to have failed. (This round was a draw)</p>
<p>Fifth Round: At the beginning of this round, they attacked each other. Mack was forced to retreat to the side of the rope, and then forced the enemy to the side of the rope and attacked him. This was the first round that Mack began to win. (Mack won this round)</p>
<p>Sixth Round: Mack initially occupied the advantage, but suddenly suffered a series of attacks. Looking at this round, Jake was in a better position, and Mack was in a defensive position. (Jake won this round)</p>
<p>Seventh Round: In this round, the two suffered heavy blows. Mack hit the jaw, and Jake was shaken. Jake retaliated with a heavy hand, also hitting the jaw. Mack actually bled. Finally, Jake hit the mouth twice again. (This round was a draw)</p>
<p>Eighth Round: Jake suddenly came with a fierce attack, but fortunately Mack avoided it. Mack counterattacked with a punch, and Jake was shaken. In the mutual attack, Jake had more hits and won the victory. (Jake won this round)</p>
<h3>Mack's Counterattack Was Too Late</h3>
<p>Ninth Round: Jake hit the mouth and hit the head twice. Mack directly hit Jake's jaw. (This round was a draw)</p>
<p>Tenth Round: Mack began to counterattack, hitting the body and hitting the face. Mack's lips were hit, cracked and bleeding, but he still had the upper hand, hitting the enemy's body repeatedly. (Mack won this round)</p>
<p>Eleventh Round: Mack was very excited and attacked fiercely. Jake's left eye was injured. (Mack won this round)</p>
<p>Twelfth Round: Mack saw that the enemy's left eye was injured, so he specialized in attacking this place. Sure enough, Jake was greatly troubled. (Mack won this round)</p>
<p>Thirteenth Round: Mack still paid attention to the opponent's injured eyes and often added poisonous hands. Jake's counterattack was unfavorable. (Mack won this round)</p>
<p>Fourteenth Round: Mack initially used poisonous hands, and Jake returned the favor. At that time, Jake's injured eyes were swollen and gradually closed, but the counterattack was effective and he had the upper hand. (Jake won this round)</p>
<p>Fifteenth Round: The last round, the situation was tense. Initially, Jake hit the head, and Mack hit the injured eyes again. After that, there were hits in the back and forth. (This round was a draw)</p>

<h3>Banking and Money Industries Telegraph to Protest the Northeastern Customs Taxes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking and Money Industries Association is extremely angry about the Japanese instigating the puppet state to intercept the Northeastern Customs Taxes. Yesterday, they urgently telegraphed the central government to jointly protest and defend the financial lifeline of the country. The original telegram reads, "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs: We were shocked to read Minister Song's declaration on the Northeastern Customs Taxes. The Japanese government has been trying to interfere with our Northeastern Customs Taxes for some time, and now they are instigating the puppet state to implement interception. We are extremely grieved. The Eastern Provinces' customs revenue reaches nearly 40 million yuan annually, which is crucial for the credit of domestic and foreign debt guarantees. Once this is shaken, the consequences are unimaginable. The impact will extend to our country's customs, the foundation of our financial lifeline, which will be completely devastated. This action clearly violates international agreements. Upon hearing this news, we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specially telegram the esteemed Yuan and Ministries to seriously protest, to protect tax rights and maintain debt credit. Our associations are willing to be the backing. We earnestly pray. Shanghai Banking Association, Money Industry Association, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Departed for Hong Kong Last Night</h3>
<p>Claiming This Trip Is Purely Personal</p>
<p>Will Return to Shanghai in the Shortest Time</p>
<p>Zhongwei Sun Ke, who was staying in Shanghai, suddenly left Shanghai on the Changxing Company's Japanese Empress last night for Hong Kong. It is rumored that his mission is to meet with Hu Hanmin to personally mediate the dispute between the two Chens in Guangdong. However, according to Sun's conversation with this newspaper's reporter last night, he said that this trip was purely personal and had nothing to do with the Guangdong affair. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation of the Guangdong Affair According to reliable sources,</p>
<p>Since the dispute between the two Chens occurred in Guangdong, Sun has repeatedly telegraphed Chen Jitang and Chen Ce in the name of all the Zhongwei staying in Shanghai, advising them to cease hostilities, but to no avail. Recently, the Guangdong affair has become increasingly deadlocked, and the war is hard to avoid. At a time when the national crisis is deepening and civil war is breaking out again, it has a great impact on our country's entire foreign policy. All parties have telegraphed Sun to personally mediate. After repeated consideration, Sun resolutely set off last night.</p>
<p>Boarding the Ship Last Night The Changxing Company's Japanese Empress arrived at the port at 2:00 PM yesterday and left Shanghai for Hong Kong at 3:00 AM this morning. Sun Ke, along with his secretary Liang Hancao and two attendants, boarded the Japanese Empress at the New Customs Wharf by ferry at 10:00 PM last night. Former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Gan Jiehou and Sun's relatives and friends went to the wharf to see him off.</p>
<p>Sun's Talk This newspaper's reporter interviewed Sun Ke on the ship last night. According to Sun, this trip was purely personal. Because his wife is ill in Hong Kong, he specially went to visit her. He also plans to visit his old mother in Macau. He will return to Shanghai in the shortest time. The rumor that he is specially mediating the Guangdong affair is not true. If he has time in Hong Kong, he will visit Mr. Hu Hanmin. If there is an opportunity, he will be happy to mediate.</p>
<h3>Wu Chaoshu Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Arrive Today</p>
<p>Guo Wen News Agency reports that Zhongwei Wu Chaoshu, who previously handled the development of Qiongya and returned to Guangdong, recently, due to the naval turmoil in Guangdong Province, Wu left Hong Kong on the Great Eastern Company's President Coolidge on the 21st and arrived in Shanghai. It is scheduled to arrive at the port from Hong Kong at 3:00 PM today. The ship will land at the New Customs Wharf.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Evening, Various Organizations Hosted a Banquet for the 19th Route Army Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>Sun Hongyi, Wang Xiaolai, and Others Delivered Farewell Speeches</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai Scheduled to Take a Steamer to Hong Kong Today</p>
<p>The eighty-nine organizations under the umbrella of the Various Organizations' National Salvation Joint Conference held a farewell gathering for the 19th Route Army officers and soldiers at 6:00 PM yesterday in the grand ballroom of the Great China Hotel on Fourth Avenue. Army Commander Cai, Division Commander Qu, Brigade Commander Weng, and others were all in attendance, creating a grand occasion. Sun Hongyi, Wang Xiaolai, and others delivered farewell speeches, while Cai Tingkai, Weng Zhaoyuan, and others gave response speeches. The details of the event are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Attendees: Representatives of over eighty organizations, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Federation, the Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association, the Republic of China National Crisis Relief Association, the Lawyers' Association, the Roads Association, the National Lawyers' Association, the Women's Political Participation Association, the Anti-Japanese Radical Association, the Overseas Chinese Federation Guangdong Native Place Association, the Huzhou Native Place Association, the Chaozhou Native Place Association, the National Crisis Assistance Association, and the Sichuan Native Place Association, all under the Various Organizations' National Salvation Joint Conference, numbering over a hundred people, including Wang Xiaolai, Li Cishan, Chu Zhuan Cheng, and Yin Zhiling.</p>
<p>The Demeanor of the Generals: After 7:00 PM, the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army arrived one after another, including Army Commander Cai Tingkai, Division Commander Qu Shounian, Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan, Chief of Staff Qiu Guozhen, Regiment Commander Zhang Junsong, and Director Fan Qiwu. General Cai Tingkai was seated in the most prominent position. Both Cai and Brigade Commander Weng were dressed in grey Western suits, looking spirited and exuding the true qualities of soldiers. Weng was slightly thinner. Zhang Junsong, Qiu Guozhen, and others were in military uniforms, all wearing Western-style attire, appearing very dignified.</p>
<p>Letter of Farewell to the Officers and Soldiers: The Shanghai Various Organizations' National Salvation Joint Conference's Farewell Letter to the 19th Route Army Officers and Soldiers. To our respected officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, With the sound of the flute and the three somber songs, we, the people of Shanghai, bid a sorrowful farewell to you. Looking back at the battles at Caojia Bridge and Miaohang Town, where you risked your lives to defend our Songhu, the cooperation between the military and the people was as close as flesh and blood. Now that we are suddenly parting, how can we not feel grief? The Yue Family Army is leaving, and the situation cannot be salvaged; the envoy of the Di people is leaving, and the feelings are unforgettable. Therefore, based on the meaning of farewell words, we convey the sincerity of the people of Shanghai's love and respect, along with their earnest expectations, to the officers and soldiers. China supports three million soldiers; only you have lived up to the expectations of the people and can protect them. In the twenty-odd years of the Republic of China, it has almost been only you. You can kill the enemy for the people, and your names will be recorded in history, forever immortal. It is not just a temporary celebration from our people. However, looking around the world, the threat from the enemy has not yet subsided. The rivers and mountains of the Northeast have not yet been recovered, and the situation in Kangzang is also pressing. Faced with this situation, how can you not shed tears at Xinting Pavilion and strike the oars in the middle of the stream again? Therefore, our people earnestly hope that you will continue the great fearless spirit of resisting Japan and saving the nation, and take on the responsibility of revitalizing the Chinese nation. No matter where you are, fight to the end! The affairs of the nation are as urgent as a blazing fire! Who does not love their country? If you can take on the responsibility without hesitation and always be the leaders in saving the nation, then the rise of the people and the shift in the national situation will surely have new developments. This is what is meant by "one army revives Xia," and you will certainly not let Shao Kang be the only one to shine in the past. This is the first point. The reason why China has today's national crisis is due to the corruption of internal affairs. Even today's resistance against Japan cannot succeed, and it is also due to the obstruction of evil forces within the country. You have experienced hundreds of battles in the revolutionary process. Now, seeing this hard-won country being handed over by these people, how can you not feel heartache? In ancient times, Yue Wu Mu's resistance against the Jin was praised by the whole nation. However, due to being bound by the principles of obedience to superiors, he willingly succumbed to internal traitors, which was deeply regretted by the world. As revolutionary heroes, you must have seen this long ago. Therefore, our people earnestly hope that you will, under the slogan of unity against external enemies, take necessary measures against those who are not united against external enemies. In short, to prevent insects from growing in objects, one must first remove the rot; to prevent people from attacking the country, one must first avoid self-inflicted wounds. Can you tolerate the likes of Qin Hui and Zhang Bangchang? Thinking back to the painful history of the retreat on March 1st, you will surely be filled with anger and draw your swords! This is the second point. The banditry in China in recent years can truly be described as extremely rampant. However, tracing the source of the bandits reveals that it is caused by the people's inability to make a living. Why can't the people of China make a living? From the outside, it is due to the economic aggression of imperialism; from the inside, it is due to the taxation and exploitation by warlords, bureaucrats, and feudal forces. If we only focus on suppressing bandits without addressing the root causes, we dare to assert that the people, not fearing death, will kill endlessly. You were successful in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi and are certainly aware of the crux of the matter. Therefore, our people earnestly hope that you will focus on pacifying the people during this bandit suppression campaign in Fujian, so that everyone can have a stable life and the bandits will disappear on their own. We also believe that the resentment caused by conquering the East and suppressing the Yi, and conquering the South and suppressing the Di, will surely be seen again today. We, the soldiers who come from the fields, know the sufferings of the people and deeply understand that the likes of Huang Chao and Chuang Wang are not communists. This is the third point. Our beloved officers and soldiers, farewell, farewell! Our people can only offer a cup of clear wine and two lines of hot tears to wish you well on your journey. Will you really leave Shanghai? We believe that you have not. Looking at the peach blossoms of Longhua, we seem to see your hot blood; seeing the flowing water of the Huangpu River, we seem to see your loyal hearts. Seeing that you have left Shanghai, your hot blood and loyal hearts are always in the hearts of the people of Shanghai. Alas, the peach blossoms of Longhua, when will they not bloom? The flowing water of the Huangpu River, when will it ever stop? We secretly wish that you can be as immortal as these. We respectfully wish you to work hard for the country and cherish yourselves for the country.</p>
<p>Details of the Farewell Banquet: At 6:00 PM, representatives of various organizations gathered together. Army Commander Cai, Division Commander Qu, Brigade Commander Weng, and others also arrived one after another. At 7:00 PM, they took their seats, and Sun Hongyi, Wang Xiaolai, Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, and Chu Fucheng were jointly elected as chairmen of the presidium. First, Sun Hongyi read the farewell letter to the 19th Route Army officers and soldiers, followed by farewell speeches from Li Cishan, Chu Fucheng, and others. Army Commander Cai, Brigade Commander Weng, and others gave response speeches, followed by speeches from Wang Xiaolai, Yin Zhiling, and others. Army Commander Cai left at 8:00 PM, and the gathering ended at 9:00 PM in a joyful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Guests and Hosts Enjoyed Themselves: First, Sun Hongyi of the presidium delivered a farewell speech and recited the farewell letter. Next, Cai Tingkai gave a response speech, briefly stating that he was very grateful for the vigorous assistance given by the people of Shanghai during the resistance against Japan. He added that he was even more ashamed of today's grand banquet. He said that he could not meet with the people of Shanghai much longer because he would be going to Fujian to suppress bandits. He hoped that the various sectors would guide him in the future, etc. Cai left at 8:00 PM. Next, Li Cishan, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Salvation Association, gave a speech saying that today's farewell had a very profound meaning. He said that the past loyalty and bravery of the 19th Route Army in resisting Japan had made him deeply grateful and admired. He said that he believed that even though the 19th Route Army was suppressing bandits in Fujian, they would still come to the rescue with disheveled hair and tied helmets when the people of Shanghai were in trouble. He hoped that the 19th Route Army could recognize that the people were the people who resisted Japan, and that the people also recognized that the 19th Route Army was the army that resisted Japan, and that the military and the people would be united in spirit forever. Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, stating: (1) The retreat of the 19th Route Army was very orderly, which was unheard of in other countries in the world. It must be known that this retreat was not shameful. (2) Internal war is suicide, and resisting foreign aggression is self-salvation. The 19th Route Army's declaration not to participate in internal wars is commendable. Finally, Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan and guest Chen Qitian also gave speeches. The speeches are omitted for brevity.</p>
<p>Cai Goes to Hong Kong: Cai Tingkai plans to take the Japanese Empress of the Changxing Steamship Company to Hong Kong this morning. The ship will set sail this morning, it is said. The association also presented a large silver shield with the inscription "Farewell to All Officers and Soldiers of the 19th Route Army" on the top, "National Glory" in the middle, and "Shanghai Various Organizations' National Salvation Joint Conference, June 22nd, Republic of China Year 21" on the bottom.</p>

Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jilun, Chen Zhezhen, Liu Zhanen, Chen Liting, Qian Xinzhi, and others attended. First, the preparatory members reported on the progress of the preparations and the fact that they had rented Room 306 on the third floor of No. 4 Hong Kong Road as an office. Next, they discussed various matters: (1) Persuading Chen Jitang, Chen Ce, and Guangzhou organizations that agree with the League's aims to stop the war. (2) Passing the establishment announcement to be published immediately. (3) Actively promoting the League, with Liu Zhanen and Chen Liting responsible for handling it. The establishment announcement of the Preparatory Committee is recorded below: Since the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Bankers' Association, and the Shanghai Money Trade Association are aware of the seriousness of internal and external troubles, they plan to form the Abolish Internal War League and have issued a telegram to solicit participation as founders. After that, they received letters and telegrams from various provinces and cities, organizations, people from all walks of life, and overseas Chinese, expressing their sympathy, which shows that everyone has the same desire for internal peace and resistance to foreign aggression. Now, the four organizations have met and decided to first establish the Preparatory Committee of the Abolish Internal War League at Room 306 on the third floor of No. 4 Hong Kong Road, Shanghai, and start working from today. The inaugural meeting of the founders will be held in Shanghai on August 6 to discuss progress and elect officers. This matter is a fundamental plan for saving the country and requires the gathering of national strength to jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility. We urge the agricultural, commercial, and industrial associations, banks, money exchanges, and various trade associations, education associations, lawyers, accountants, journalists, and various public associations of various provinces and cities, as well as people from all walks of life who have joined the founding, to quickly solicit participation from those who have not yet joined in their local areas. Those who have not yet joined the founding should quickly send letters to join and designate representatives to inform us of their names before the deadline in order to convene and facilitate progress. Do not be disappointed.</p>
<h3>Revised Collection Regulations for Business Tax in This City</h3>
<p>Including Revised Taxable Standards and Tax Rates</p>
<p>The detailed regulations and tax rates for business tax in this city were drafted earlier last year and stipulated to be levied from the beginning of the twentieth fiscal year (i.e., July of the twentieth year of the Republic of China). Now, the detailed regulations and tax rates have been formally approved by the central government, and the municipal government has formally announced them yesterday. They are recorded below:</p>
<p>Collection Regulations: Shanghai Municipal Business Tax Collection Regulations (Revised Edition, June 20th Year). Article 1: These regulations are formulated in accordance with the Business Tax Law promulgated by the central government. Article 2: All businesses within the area of this city, except factories that should have their factory tax collected by the central government or banks organized as joint-stock companies that have their income tax collected, should be levied business tax in accordance with these regulations. Article 3: Businesses that meet one of the following items will be exempted from business tax after investigation and verification: (1) Businesses that are taxed according to their capital amount, with a capital amount of less than 500 yuan. (2) Businesses that are taxed according to their business income, with an annual business income of less than 1,000 yuan. (3) National businesses or municipal businesses, but businesses jointly operated by officials and merchants should still be levied business tax. (4) Businesses that are not for profit. (5) Businesses designated by central government laws to be exempt from taxation. Article 4: The business tax in this city is collected by the Business Tax Collection Office established by the Finance Bureau. Article 5: The taxable standards and tax rates for business tax are specified separately in a table according to different types. Article 6: For the sale of goods, the business tax for the wholesale part may be paid at a fixed rate of one-quarter. The aforementioned wholesale business refers specifically to wholesalers in the same industry. If there is also retail business in addition to wholesale, the tax amount should still be calculated separately. Article 7: The calculation of business capital is based on the actual paid-in capital. However, for joint-stock companies, various public reserve funds should be taxed at one-third of the capital amount. Article 8: If various businesses have branches or factories within the city, their business tax may be paid jointly by the main store or factory. If the main store or factory or the branch or factory is located outside the city, the business tax should be paid solely by the branch or factory or the main store or factory located within the city. If the capital cannot be divided for calculation, the Business Tax Collection Office will estimate the amount of tax payable. If there is any objection, it will be handled in accordance with Article 19. Article 9: If one household operates several types of businesses with different tax rates, the calculation of the tax amount should be based on the business and determined according to the main part of the business. Article 10: Manufacturers who directly retail their manufactured goods at their manufacturing plant should still be taxed according to the tax rate for manufacturing. The retail part should not be taxed separately for business tax for sales. Article 11: Factories that have already had their factory tax collected by the central government or have been levied business tax by this city according to the manufacturing industry, should be levied business tax for sales separately if they set up separate locations to promote their goods. Article 12: Those who operate businesses with their own capital and do not have the nature of selling on behalf of customers and collecting commissions from them, should still be taxed according to business tax even if they have obtained a tooth card (license). Article 13: For businesses that use the amount of business or the amount of capital or other calculated amount as the taxable standard, the Business Tax Collection Office should estimate the annual business income, or the capital amount, and the amount calculated by other methods, and determine the total amount to be collected for the whole year according to the tax rate, allocate it to four seasons, and fill out the receipt vouchers for collection at one time each quarter (the amount collected each quarter is one-quarter of the whole year). However, for short-term businesses, it may be collected monthly or at one time. For newly established businesses, their business tax will be calculated from the quarter or month of commencement. If it is collected at one time, it will be calculated from the time of commencement. Article 14: The amount of business tax payable by a business operator should be reviewed and decided by the Business Tax Collection Office based on the investigation report of the investigator or the report submitted by the business operator. Article 15: After the Business Tax Collection Office decides the amount of business tax payable by a business operator, it should not be reduced or increased within one year, unless otherwise stipulated by laws and regulations. Article 16: If the annual business income or capital amount and the amount calculated by other methods of a business that meets the tax regulations are less than one thousand yuan, the tax will be calculated by rounding to the nearest yuan. Article 17: When the business tax is started, the Business Tax Collection Office may send personnel to cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce to investigate in accordance with the following regulations, compile a tax collection register, fill out the Business Tax Investigation Certificate, have it stamped by the relevant industry association, and request the Chamber of Commerce to transfer it to the Business Tax Collection Office for issuance. If there is no same-industry association organization, the Chamber of Commerce will apply for transfer on their behalf. In the first month of the following year, the business operator will fill out and submit a report form to request the exchange of the Business Tax Investigation Certificate, and the procedures will be the same. As for newly established businesses, they should submit a report before starting and receive the certificate. (1) Business type and number, and its location. (2) Name, native place, and address of the business operator. (3) Amount of business capital. (4) Estimated annual business income. The aforementioned business investigation certificate should be exchanged once a year without any certificate fee. Article 18: For businesses that use the amount of business or other calculated amount as the taxable standard, the business operator should settle the amount of business or the amount calculated by other methods once at the end of each year and report it to the Business Tax Collection Office before January 15 of the following year. However, if the business ends in less than one year, it should be reported at the time of termination. Article 19: If the business operator fails to report in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 and Article 18, or the report is untrue, the Business Tax Collection Office may send personnel to investigate and verify the amount of tax payable. If there is any objection, the investigation situation should be explained in detail, and if there is evidence, the evidence should be submitted to the Finance Bureau for referral to the Review Committee for assessment. The same applies if there is any objection to the decision of the Business Tax Collection Office when the business tax is started. Article 20: If the amount of the taxable standard reported by the business operator is certified by the Chamber of Commerce or an accountant, the investigation procedure may be exempted (joint-stock companies should be certified by an accountant). However, if the Business Tax Collection Office has any doubts, it will still be handled in accordance with Article 19. Article 21: The organization of the Review Committee and the rules of assessment will be determined separately. Article 22: When collecting business tax, if necessary, the Business Tax Collection Office may inspect the business operator's account books, documents, goods, etc., but it must be carried out in conjunction with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

Article 24: The Business Tax Investigation Certificate should be hung in a conspicuous place for inspection. If it is lost or damaged, a new certificate should be exchanged and a fine of two jiao of silver dollars should be paid. Article 25: If the business operator closes down, transfers the business, reorganizes, adds a record, or increases capital, etc., he should immediately report to the Business Tax Collection Office and surrender the old certificate or exchange it for a new certificate. Article 26: If the business operator reports more than less, or conceals the business income or capital amount, or the amount calculated by other methods, or operates without a certificate, once it is found out or reported, the Business Tax Collection Office will submit it to the Finance Bureau for submission to the Review Committee for review and impose a fine of five to ten times the amount of tax evaded. Article 27: The Finance Bureau will issue a notice once a month for the collection of business tax and fines, and compile a creditworthiness record every year, which will be reviewed by the Review Committee, signed, and published. A statement of receipts and expenditures will also be prepared every quarter and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for verification. Article 28: All types of donations and taxes in this city that are of the same nature as business tax shall be temporarily converted into business tax in accordance with the old tax rates and collected separately. Article 29: For businesses that are not listed in the table in Article 5 of these regulations but meet the nature of business tax collection, the Finance Bureau may propose the tax rates to be levied and submit them to the Municipal Government for referral to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval for implementation.

<h3>Public Concession Electric Power Company Strike</h3>
<p>Party and Government Organs Send Personnel to Investigate Jointly</p>
<p>Workers Express Waiting Quietly for Legal Handling</p>
<p>After Hogan assumed the position of general manager of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, he dismissed 121 old workers who had worked for more than ten years at the Ferry Road plant on June 4th, which aroused public outrage among more than 2,500 workers. The Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel yesterday to investigate and mediate. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Establishing a Contract The electric power business in the Public Concession was originally under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council. In 1929, it was sold to American merchants for operation. At that time, an electric power business contract was established, and Article 14 of the contract stipulated the treatment of employees as follows: "Regarding the Chinese and foreign employees of the Electrical Department, the Company shall fully accept the obligations of the Municipal Council, including annuities, pensions, and other rights and benefits. The Company must also recognize and retain existing employees and shall not dismiss them without cause, except for incompetence, neglect of duty, and other reasons stipulated in the current contract of the Municipal Council. Employees shall be guaranteed in terms of remuneration, promotion, and years of service and shall not be endangered or adversely affected by the change to the Company."</p>
<p>Large-Scale Dismissals After the new general manager took office, citing the impact of business operations, on June 4th of this year, 121 old workers who had worked for more than ten years in the west section of the Ferry Road old factory, the middle section, the Yangzhou Road section, the middle section business office, and the east section supervisor office were suddenly dismissed without announcing the reason. Savings and retirement funds were withheld and not issued. All 2,500 workers believed that the Municipal Council had repeatedly instructed the acquiring company to protect the rights of employees, which was clear evidence. However, in less than three years, the company suddenly destroyed the agreement, causing widespread panic. They sent a letter to Fessenden, the president of the Municipal Council, requesting assistance, and petitioned the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to uphold justice and mediate impartially to avoid unemployment.</p>
<p>Party and Government Investigation In order to demand protection, all workers launched the organization of the Shanghai Electric Power Industry Union. It is heard that it has been approved by the Municipal Party Department and preparations will begin immediately so that it can be established as soon as possible. After receiving the report, the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to avoid the expansion of disputes, specially sent personnel such as Zhang Sheng yesterday morning at 10:00 am to investigate the truth so as to conduct mediation according to law. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also scheduled a meeting with the person in charge of the union at 1:00 pm on the 25th.</p>
<p>Workers' Attitude A worker from the Electric Power Company told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday that the treatment was fair and reasonable under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council, and the relationship between the employer and the employee was harmonious. Since the sale to the American imperialist capitalists, they have violated the electric power business contract signed with the Municipal Council, and they have been destroying the workers by dismissing old workers one after another without reason. The treatment is harsh, which is very different from before, and temporary workers are hired to replace the work. All kinds of oppression are too numerous to mention. Now we have decided to wait quietly for the party and government organs to mediate according to the law, but during this period, if the capitalists continue to attack our laborers, I am afraid that major disputes will occur.</p>

<h3>Concession Telephone Workers Fully Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wages Deducted for Strike Period</p>
<p>Strike Committee Organization Has Been Abolished</p>
<p>After the strike committee of the Concession Telephone Company workers issued a declaration of painful resumption of work, all more than 3,000 workers resumed work unconditionally starting yesterday. The strike committee temporarily withdrew. Twelve workers on the north-bound section of Haining Road were refused to resume work by the company. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Full Resumption of Work All workers obeyed the order of the strike committee and resumed work in the company starting at 5:00 am yesterday. The Public Concession and French Concession police stations were ordered to increase the number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives to guard and protect the resumption of work at the entrances of various branches and warehouses. By 6:00 am, all more than 3,000 workers from the Jiangxi Road headquarters, the Fujian Road central branch, the Huishan Road east-bound branch, the Haining Road north-bound branch, the Mathes Silk Road west-bound branch, the Bixu Road French south-bound branch, the Mintini Yin Road new French south-bound branch, the Yidingpan Road Lusheng branch, and the Yangshupu repair shop had fully resumed work.</p>
<p>Dismissal of Several People The company believes that twelve workers on the north-bound section of Haining Road destroyed automatic telephone calls during the strike and refused to allow them to resume work yesterday, announcing their unconditional dismissal. Their wages for the strike period were fully deducted. As for automatic telephone calls, they have been affected by the strike, the sound is low and turbid, and users feel quite inconvenient. Moreover, a small number of users have had their automatic machines damaged and no one to repair them, so they have had to temporarily suspend use. Now that the workers have resumed work, the company has been trying to repair them as much as possible since yesterday and is stepping up its work to fully restore them to their original state in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Strike Committee Abolished The strike committee organization includes the propaganda department, transportation department, discipline department, fundraising department, youth worker department, secretariat, strike court, presidium, and the offices of various branches. The strike committee told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday that this time, due to the oppression of the imperialist police station, the destruction of worker traitors and running dogs, and the hard-line policy of the capitalists, the solidarity was dissipated and suffered a disastrous defeat. The strike committee has decided to temporarily withdraw, engage in strict and sound organization, and prepare for the second struggle.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Rehabilitation Association Asks National Government to Issue 300 Million in Relief Vouchers</h3>
<p>And Sends Letter to Banks and Money Shops Associations to Grant Loans</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Disaster Area Industrial and Commercial Rehabilitation Committee has been actively conducting investigations into various industries in the disaster area. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm, the committee convened its second standing committee meeting to discuss eight important cases. It was resolved to expand the organization, and it was also resolved to send telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Central Political Council, and the Central Party Department, requesting the re-issuance of 300 million yuan in relief vouchers. These relief vouchers should be no different from banknotes and circulated on the market to provide assistance. The meeting also passed detailed rules for handling affairs and sent letters to the Bank Association and the Money Shop Association, requesting that they notify their member banks and money shops to lend credit as much as possible within a possible range so that the disaster-stricken industries and businesses can regain their strength. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Second Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday The committee held its second standing committee meeting at its Hankou Road office at 3:00 pm yesterday. More than fifty representatives from various industries, including Pan Xusheng, Sun Mingqi, Ye Jiaxing, Zhang Yuchi, Qiu Liangyu, Jin Wenxiang, Xie Zhongle, Zhang Dalian, Cai Qiaojun, Xiao Zhemian, Zhou Shiheng, and Cheng Guichu, attended. The meeting was chaired by Pan Xusheng and recorded by Sun Mingqi. (A) Reporting Matters (Omitted) (B) Matters for Discussion (1) The case of the meat industry associations in Zhabei and other places jointly requesting the municipal government to exempt slaughter taxes in the disaster area for relief purposes (Resolution) Forwarded to the municipal government for exemption and replied by letter (2) The case of the soy sauce industry association submitting that landlords in the Zhabei and other disaster areas are forcing small rents and increasing rents, affecting recovery, and submitting opinions for review (Resolution) Forwarded to the Rent Reduction Committee for serious handling (3) Zhang Dalian submitted three opinions on the recovery of the disaster area for review (Resolution) The original opinions will be mimeographed and sent to each committee member for signing and commenting, and will be compiled and discussed at the next meeting (4) Regarding the reported announcement by the municipal government and the municipal finance bureau on the exemption of various taxes, a proposal for review (All considered that the period of exemption of various taxes stipulated by the municipal government was completely within the period of war and occupation by the Japanese army. Since the government had lost its protection, the citizens had no reason to pay taxes, so what was the use of the exemption?) (Resolution) Send personnel to petition the municipal government and the municipal finance bureau, and before restoring the state before January 28, all taxes in the war zone should be completely exempted (5) The detailed rules for handling affairs of the association have been drafted, and a request for approval (Resolution) Revised and passed, and reported to the committee (6) (Omitted) (7) A request to temporarily suspend the collection of various tooth taxes in the disaster areas of the Shangbao and Liang counties before the exemption method is determined (Resolution) Passed (8) The association should appoint members to draft a recovery plan first (Resolution) Appoint Zhou Shiheng to draft, and the meeting adjourned at 6:30 pm</p>
<p>Telegrams to Various Ministries and Departments of the National Government After the meeting, the association sent telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Central Party Department, and the Central Political Council, requesting the re-issuance of 300 million yuan in relief vouchers for recovery. The original petition stated: "The petition is for the expansion of the disaster area and the difficulty of recovery. We earnestly request approval for the issuance of relief vouchers to facilitate circulation and benefit recovery. During the January 28 incident, the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, relying on the concessions as a base for operations. Aircraft and heavy artillery burned, killed, looted, and plundered all commercial markets in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places, turning them into ruins. According to statistics released by the Social Affairs Bureau, the losses exceeded 160 million yuan. These huge losses are the source of livelihood for the citizens in the disaster areas of Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places. Now, the source of livelihood has been turned into rubble and scorched earth. It is difficult to plan for recovery. Although the government is aware of the tragic situation in the disaster area, there is an organization of the Shanghai-Songhu War Zone Relief Committee, planning for recovery and issuing public bonds of 20 million yuan for relief, but it is like a drop in the bucket and will not solve the fundamental problem. Moreover, the plans of the Relief Committee are all for public works. To seek the recovery of industry and commerce in the disaster area, the government must have a huge amount of relief funds. However, the government's reliance on agriculture is an undeniable fact. More than 110 million yuan of bonds have been issued in the past, and most of the annual national tax revenue is used to repay the principal and interest of the bonds. If a huge amount of bonds is issued again, it is actually impossible. Even if it is not, after the people obtain the bonds, the discount loss is less than 50%. It is not only a great loss to the national treasury but also less beneficial to the victims. After repeated deliberation, it is requested that the government issue 300 million yuan in relief vouchers. These relief vouchers are no different from banknotes, circulating in the market and fully usable. The government will allocate 500,000 yuan from the Jianghai Customs each month from the interest reduction of the bonds, collect the same amount of vouchers, and destroy them at once, completing the destruction in 50 years. A committee organized by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Silver Industry Association, and the Money Industry Association will be responsible for the issuance, custody, collection, and destruction. In this way, the government will reduce losses, and it will be easy and convenient. For the people, they will receive economic circulation and benefit greatly. We dare to submit this document, hoping that it will be reviewed and approved to provide relief and benefit recovery, which is fair and convenient. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan."</p>
<p>Letters to Bank Association, etc. The association also sent letters to the Bank Association and the Money Shop Association, saying: "We, the country, have been suffering from frequent floods and droughts in recent years, and the people's livelihood is declining. Shanghai-Songhu and other areas have suffered extremely heavy losses after the war. The industry and commerce have been devastated. Shanghai-Songhu is the hub of the national economy, and its industrial and commercial development is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is essential to find ways to recover it in order to make the people happy and stabilize the society. There are many ways to recover, but it is important to fully provide funds to industries and businesses in the disaster area to make them active. We dare to request that your association notify its members to lend credit as much as possible within a possible range so that disaster-stricken industries and businesses can regain their strength. The industry and commerce are the center of social economy, the main task of the economy, the foundation of agriculture, industry and commerce, and especially the cause of the economy. To provide relief to industry and commerce is to help ourselves. I respectfully submit this for your review."</p>
<h3>The Merchant Shipping Bureau's Ningbo Ferry Xinjiangtian's Accident</h3>
<p>Pilot Officer's Negligence</p>
<p>Chief Mate Reports the Course of Events</p>
<p>The Merchant Shipping Bureau's Shanghai-Ningbo ferry Xinjiangtian had an accident on its last trip from Shanghai to Ningbo when it encountered fog, almost hitting a reef and sinking. The course of events is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Course of Events At 11:20 am on the 15th of this month, the Xinjiangtian ferry departed from Shanghai to Ningbo. In the middle of the journey, thick fog suddenly occurred on the sea surface. The pilot officer from Jiangxi, Pu Sidan, deviated eastward from the normal course. Within half a nautical mile, the Fazhi lighthouse was discovered, and the front had reached the chaotic reefs. The sea water was only four or five feet deep. Seeing that the Xinjiangtian ferry was about to hit the reef, the chief mate and others were shocked, and the passengers were even more panicked. Fortunately, the captain and others urgently ordered to change direction, and the degree of danger was imminent. Thanks to the chief mate He Hongyao's great efforts to avoid it sideways, it was avoided hitting the reef. All crew members believed that the incident was lucky.</p>
<p>Crew Report Yesterday, chief mate He Hongyao and others reported to general manager Li Guojie, saying: "On the last trip to Ningbo, halfway through the journey, the sea was filled with thick fog. The pilot officer did not follow the normal course and deviated eastward straight. At that time, the captain and chief mate were both on the bridge. Suddenly, the southwest lighthouse was discovered half a nautical mile ahead, which was extremely dangerous. The water there was only four feet deep, and the order was urgently given to change course, which fortunately avoided disaster. The danger was truly imminent. If it had been a minute later, it would have hit the reef and sunk, and the lives and property on the ferry would have been sacrificed. I have drawn up a statement for your review."</p>
<p>Pilot Officer Punishment After receiving the report, the director of the bureau believed that the pilot officer was so negligent in his duties and risked the lives and property of the people and the bureau, and that Shanghai and Ningbo ferries have the most passengers. The pilot officer's negligence is extremely dangerous to navigation. It is proposed to first punish the pilot officer and promote chief mate He Hongyao to pilot officer as a reward.</p>
<h3>Provincial Order to Encourage Purchase of War Zone Mortgage Vouchers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, saying: "The Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee's Shanghai Standing Committee Chairman Shi Liangcai sent an official letter saying that the province's relief funds for the war zone were previously resolved at the first general meeting to use 1 million yuan of mortgage vouchers issued by your government. After repeated contacts with the Shanghai financial community by the members of the Finance Group to negotiate mortgage methods, no agreement has been reached. However, considering that the people in the war zone are in urgent need of relief and the delay is worrying, after discussion at the fourth Shanghai Standing Committee, it is proposed that your government issue an order to various counties, inviting officials to encourage the largest landowners to purchase them separately, which is more certain, etc." The record is on file. The losses of the people in the war zone are the most severe for farmers. The relationship between landowners and farmers is close. If the losses of farmers are not compensated, their livelihoods will not be maintained, and farming will not be continued. The landowners will not be able to collect rent. Now, reliable mortgage vouchers are encouraged to be purchased to relieve the poor farmers. Helping others is helping oneself. The rent that landowners should receive will definitely improve day by day. For the benefit of the landowners, this method cannot be said to be harsh. A special letter is sent to you for your perusal, etc. After being submitted to the 500th meeting of the committee of the government, it was resolved to issue orders to Jiading, Taicang, Baoshan and neighboring counties to encourage purchases separately. In addition to replying by letter and distributing, the county magistrate is ordered to follow the order and report.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Prompt Relief for War Zone Losses</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan yesterday, requesting that measures be taken to provide prompt relief for the losses in the Shanghai-Songhu War Zone. The original text stated: "The petition is for a petition. At the third members' meeting convened by the association on June 18, the suggestion of the Dough Industry Association stated that about thirty members of our association were damaged in the war zone, and the number of other industries is unknown. Now that the war is over and people's hearts have stabilized slightly, all industries have suffered this huge loss, which is related to their livelihoods. During the meeting, it should be proposed for discussion and petition the government to find ways to compensate for it in case of emergency, etc." The members' meeting resolved to petition the government to promptly develop relief measures for various industries in the Shanghai-Songhu War Zone and implement them immediately. The losses in the Shanghai-Songhu War Zone, based solely on the registration of forms filled out with the War Zone Loss Registration Committee jointly established by the three agencies, including the Social Affairs Bureau, have reached as high as 160 million yuan. Because it is the center of industry and commerce and the focus of mechanized warfare, it is appropriate that the disaster is severe beyond the ordinary. It is unknown when it will be restored. The association previously telegraphed requesting that Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance's original proposal be followed, allocating 500,000 yuan per month from the public debt reduction fund for the needs of post-war relief in Shanghai. Today, it has also submitted another petition to your academy, requesting that all national and local taxes in the war zone be temporarily exempted, hoping that the vitality of the merchants and people in the disaster area will be restored slightly so that they can gradually seek to recover their businesses. It is necessary for your academy to preside over the matter and quickly order the competent departments to properly handle the allocation of funds and tax exemption immediately so that the municipal government can take action. It is reasonable to record the case and respectfully submit it to your academy for review and approval to handle it separately, which is fair and convenient. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan."</p>

<h3>Various Industries Firmly Oppose Jiangsu Province's Special Business Tax</h3>
<p>Ministries and Departments Clearly Ordered to Revoke</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Disregards Public Sentiment</p>
<p>The six guilds of the Shanghai bean, rice, oil cake, and miscellaneous grain industries held a general meeting yesterday at the bean and rice industry association to oppose the Jiangsu province's special business tax. More than 170 representatives from various guilds attended. The meeting was chaired by Zhu Yunzhang, who reported that the bean and rice industry association had requested the municipal chamber of commerce to telegraph the Executive Yuan to order the revocation of the Jiangsu province's special tax, which was a disguised form of likin. The ministries and departments, considering the difficulty of business, clearly ordered the revocation. However, it was reported that the Jiangsu provincial government had decided to implement the collection of the special tax on July 1. The attendees were asked to discuss countermeasures. The representatives of various industries were extremely angry and unanimously opposed it. If it is implemented, they will not recognize it temporarily. After consultation, the municipal chamber of commerce will be informed again. The original letter reads: "The Jiangsu Provincial Government's special business tax is more harmful to the township people and merchants than likin. Various industry groups in Jiangsu Province have risen up to oppose it. Our association has also repeatedly stated the situation and requested your association to forward a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to order the revocation, begging you to telegraph the Jiangsu Provincial Government to withdraw its decision. The ministries and departments, considering the difficulty of business, clearly ordered the revocation. However, it was read in the newspaper on the 21st of this month that the Jiangsu Provincial Government had decided to implement the special tax on July 1 and set up offices to collect it, 甘蹈厘金覆轍, disregarding the intentions of the central government and resisting the clear order of the ministries and departments to revoke it, and disregarding public sentiment. It goes its own way without any忌偉, puts the government's prestige in the dust, and puts the merchants and people in a desperate situation. The political orders it issues have lost their basis in the first place, so our merchants and people are瞻前顾后, how can we accept it? Moreover, the administrative system should not be chaotic, as it has been since ancient times, and not just now. Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Government is running a special tax, setting up a general office in this city, which means that its administrative jurisdiction has clearly invaded the scope of this city. Once this end is opened, the political orders will be inconsistent, and the political system will be complicated in the future. 惟意是欲, merchants will be 任人剥削, and the merchants and people will have no 噍类. Therefore, our association has again proposed to your association at the members' representative meeting on the 18th of this month, please unite with the chambers of commerce of various counties in the province to oppose the special tax run by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. It is expected that a decision will be made to implement it. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government insists on its original proposal, as reported in the newspaper. Once the tax is collected as scheduled, the merchants and people will be unable to bear it, and tax resistance movements and strikes may occur, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government will be responsible. It is believed that Shanghai holds the hub of the country's commerce, and your association is a giant of the national chamber of commerce. With a high call, the mountains respond, so I am specially sending another letter to you, respectfully requesting you to quickly send telegrams to the chambers of commerce of various counties in the province, convene relevant industry associations locally, and unanimously oppose it to the end, or directly telegraph the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce, while still trying to resist, and inform relevant industries throughout the province. If the Jiangsu Provincial Government implements the collection, they swear not to recognize it. You are known for your dedication to protecting commerce, and I urge you to implement it quickly so that the merchants in Jiangsu can get out of trouble.</p>
<h3>Japanese Commissioner Okazaki Visited Yu Hongjun Yesterday</h3>
<p>Expressed the Sincerity of the Japanese Army's Complete Withdrawal</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reported that although the Japanese members of the joint committee on the demilitarized zone D and the over-border road construction east of Songhu Road have repeatedly stated that they will completely withdraw in the shortest possible time, the Japanese side has not yet stated the exact time of withdrawal. Our member Yu Hongjun inquired again on yesterday morning about the date of withdrawal and hoped to receive a reply immediately. Japanese Commissioner Okazaki personally visited our member Yu Hongjun at the municipal government at 4:40 pm yesterday to answer everything. The two talked for an hour before the Japanese commissioner took his leave. The reporter of Huadong News Agency immediately visited Mr. Yu, who said that the meeting was due to his repeated inquiries about the time of the Japanese army's withdrawal. The Japanese side, in order to show its sincerity, specially sent Commissioner Okazaki to personally reply. The Japanese side stated that the withdrawal of troops stationed in the D zone and the area east of the Songhu Road over-border construction is not a problem. However, due to the stationing locations in the concession and the preparation for all withdrawals, there are still various difficulties, so it has not been possible to fulfill the wish temporarily. However, in any case, the withdrawal will be implemented in the shortest possible time, hoping that our side will understand. The person said that although the Japanese side's withdrawal time has its difficulties, our side also deeply believes that there is no reason to stay according to the spirit of the agreement. In any case, the withdrawal must be made within a day, otherwise our side will request the joint committee to negotiate.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County's Methods for Urging Payment of Past-Due Summer Grain Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau stated that the township heads in various districts had substantial arrears during the summer grain tax period. They had petitioned the county government to issue a general order, setting a deadline for clearing payments by the 25th of this month. Now, the bureau reports that the deadline is approaching, but collections are meager. There have even been instances of conflicts between the tax collection officers and the township heads. Therefore, they submitted a report to the county government detailing the difficulties in urging payment. This matter was specifically raised for discussion at the 106th county administrative meeting. The following methods were decided upon: (1) The district and township heads should submit a clear list of delinquent households, along with the grain collection records, for review by the Finance Bureau. The bureau will then summon and pursue the most notorious debtors, with the assistance of local residents. (2) If the township heads fail to provide a clear list of delinquent households or submit the grain collection records, the districts should be notified to impose sanctions on the township heads.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Road Citizens' Movement to Reduce Rent</h3>
<p>Resolution to Hold a Petition on the 24th</p>
<p>Over two hundred shops and residents on Suzhou Road and in De'an Lane, including Maofeng Ironworks, have observed that the neighboring Taian Lane and other lanes have already received rent reductions of up to three months. However, the landlord of De'an Lane, Zhu Yicai, has ignored this trend and even dares to rely on his influence to oppress tenants by suing them for three months of rent that should be waived. This has caused widespread public outrage among the tenants in the lane. They have united to demand rent reductions. The case has been heard in court twice already. The 15th branch of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Associations, the Suzhou Road Business Association, has also convened a general meeting of representatives from various organizations to discuss assistance measures. It has now been decided, based on the resolution of the general meeting, to organize a joint petition with various organizations on the 24th of this month.</p>

<h3>First Special Court Corrects Cases with Conflicting Judgments</h3>
<p>Cases with Differing Chinese and Western Judgments</p>
<p>All to Be Rewritten with the Cause of Action and Retried</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sentences Were Reduced in Four Cases</p>
<p>After the Xinhai Revolution, the authority of the consular assessors in the Mixed Court suddenly expanded, reversing the roles of guest and host. In criminal cases, the consular judgments became the standard for execution. For major cases such as murder and robbery, the Chinese judges were limited by their authority to impose sentences of no more than five years. If the crime warranted a sentence of more than five years, it would be noted that the prisoner would be detained for five years and then brought back to court for further review. However, the Western judgments of the consular assessors differed. They could determine the length of imprisonment based on the severity of the crime, with the only exception being that they could not impose the death penalty. Therefore, before the Mixed Court was recovered, there were many prisoners in the Western prison in Tilanqiao serving sentences of ten or twenty years. After China recovered the Mixed Court and established a formal court system, efforts were repeatedly made to provide relief in these cases with conflicting Chinese and Western judgments. However, a satisfactory solution could not be found, leading to delays until now. Now, with the agreement of Zhou Xianjue, President of the First Special District Court, and the Municipal Council, corrective procedures have been agreed upon. The legal department of the Municipal Council will collect the case files of prisoners in the Western prison who have conflicting Chinese and Western judgments, and rewrite each case with the cause of action. The First Special Court will then re-examine and pronounce judgment. The previous imprisonment period will be deducted from the new sentence, with each day of detention counting as one day of the new sentence. Yesterday morning, Chief Judge Qian Hongye of the First Criminal Court specially convened court to re-sentence four cases. These four cases involved a total of six defendants. Tian Changfu, Chen Liansheng, and Xu Xiaolianzi were originally sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment each, but their sentences were reduced to ten years of imprisonment each. Li Changqi and others were originally sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, but this was changed to twelve years of imprisonment. Zhao Zhengfu and others were also originally sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, but this was changed to ten years of imprisonment. Li Da was originally sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, but this was changed to seven years of imprisonment. Either the Municipal Council or the defendants can appeal these judgments, just like in ordinary cases. After Judge Qian announced the judgments, Ru Bao-yi, the lawyer for the detective office, immediately stated that according to the new sentence, Li Da's term had already expired. However, the Municipal Council was still considering whether to appeal, so he requested that Li Da not be released and remain in custody temporarily. Judge Qian approved the request. It is reported that there are many cases that need to be re-sentenced. Yesterday was the first time.</p>
<h3>Shaobo Dike Work Unharmed</h3>
<p>Rumors of Collapse Are Inaccurate</p>
<p>Truth Reported by the Canal Works Committee</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors of the Shaobo dike collapsing, but the Jiangsu Construction Department has not received any such report. Director Dong, concerned about the suffering of the people, paid close attention to the matter. In addition to urgently telegraphing Chen, a technician, to conduct a thorough investigation and report, he also telegraphed Han, the deputy director of the Canal Works Relief Committee, to inquire about the situation. The reply stated, "Director Dong of the Construction Department: The telegram stating that Technician Chen did not see the Shaobo dike collapse has been received. A telegram from Acting Director Lu states that the Shaobo New Dike has not collapsed at all. However, at the 110th reinforcement project, which borders a deep pond, the previous request for additional pile funding was not approved. After several days of rain, the slope slightly bulged. The contractor, Zhao Weijin, dug open the bulge, added large tendons, and re-compacted the area to prevent further expansion. There was no collapse or contractor fleeing." It is requested that this telegram be published in the newspaper to avoid misinformation. Signed, Han Guojun.</p>
<h3>A Traitor, Unrepentant, Opens a Gambling Den in Hongzhen</h3>
<p>Entering Through a Toilet to Reach a Hidden Paradise</p>
<p>Pai Gow and Shake Dice Games Bring Great Joy to Gamblers</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army gradually withdrew from Zhabei, all the gambling dens protected by former traitors have closed down. Recently, however, rumors have spread that someone has organized a large-scale gambling den in Hongzhen, within the evacuated area, calling it the Hongli Company. After hearing the news, the reporter initially doubted its veracity. Yesterday, he made a detour to investigate and found that it was indeed true. The company is located at 75 Yucai Road in Hongzhen. The front door is the former site of the Huaxing Soap Factory. Gamblers enter through a small door in the back of the Fuji Ice Drink Shop. After entering the door, one walks a few steps down a long, narrow alley. At the end of the alley is a toilet. Climbing the stairs from the toilet, one suddenly finds oneself in a bright and spacious area, a hidden paradise. To the left is Pai Gow, to the right is Shake Dice. One sees a gathering of heroes, shouting and cheering, in a state of great joy. The reporter toured the area and exited the way he came. He saw guards stationed nearby. By the time he returned, the lights were already lit.</p>
<h3>Suspect in Li Minghui's Lover's Violent Death Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Police Still Investigating</p>
<p>Cannot Be Transferred Immediately</p>
<p>The tragic love story of Little Sister Li Minghui, which was staged in Hong Kong, caused a sensation everywhere. Her living lover, Zheng Guoyou, was interrogated by the British authorities in Hong Kong more than ten times. It was then learned that Wang Nengxiang, another suspect in the murder of her deceased lover, Feng Deqian, had fled to Shanghai. A detective, Mai Runhui, was dispatched to Shanghai to investigate and arrest him. Initially, there were no clues. However, recently, Lu Liankui, the chief detective of the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession, discovered that Wang and his wife, Wang Yang, were hiding at 70 Xie Xu Branch Road in the city. On the morning of the 20th, at 11:30 AM, Detective Liu Shaokui and Detective Wu Hanzhang were dispatched to the police station in the Second District, and, together with the police officers, went to Wang's residence and arrested Wang and his wife. They were detained at the police station. Yesterday morning, they requested the First Special District Court to issue a document to transfer them to the court for interrogation by Judge Qian. According to Ru Bao-yi, the lawyer for the Municipal Council, the Hong Kong authorities have requested that the suspect be transferred to Hong Kong for trial. However, there are still several points that have not been clarified, so he requested a postponement. Judge Qian briefly questioned the suspect about his age and origin, and then ordered him to be detained for one week. If evidence is found, he should be prosecuted in this court. The request from Hong Kong for transfer cannot be granted. It is reported that Wang is from Nantongzhou, Jiangsu. He used to be a carpenter in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Bandit Li Changyuan Executed in Lu Shaotang Case</h3>
<p>Sun Jinsheng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang, a comprador at the Fairall Trading Company and a native of Suzhou, was kidnapped by bandits on Yunnan Road in December of the previous year, and a large ransom was demanded. After Chief Detective Lu Liankui of the Public Concession Police and others arrested the leaders of the gang, Shuai Zhongping from Anhui, Wang Sanhuai, Hu Mingde, and more than ten others, they were sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. They were sentenced to death and imprisonment, etc., and the sentences were carried out. In October of last year, the detectives handling the case went to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau and extradited two accomplices, Li Changyuan and Sun Jinsheng, both from Tianjin, along with the suspected women, Sun Nian and Jin Li. They were sent to the Special Court for questioning and confession. Jin Li died of illness in the women's detention center. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong announced the judgment. Li Changyuan was sentenced to death for jointly kidnapping and demanding ransom. Sun Jinsheng was sentenced to life imprisonment. Sun Li was found not guilty. The prosecution of Jin Li was dismissed because of death.</p>
<h3>British Mail Ship Catches Fire En Route to Japan</h3>
<p>The "Rawalpindi"</p>
<p>Recently, there have been a series of maritime accidents. After the "Shengjing" ran aground, there was a fire on a Dutch ship. Now, a regular mail ship of the British company has also encountered an accident mid-voyage. The reporter, considering that the ship is a first-class new mail ship of the British company and recognized by the British government as a regular British-Chinese mail ship, has made a detailed investigation and recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Sailing from Shanghai to Japan: A British-Chinese mail ship of the British company sails every fourteen days. Since last year, old ships have been phased out and new ships have been built with greater horsepower and tonnage. The ships currently sailing between Shanghai and London are divided into Class A and Class B ships. Class A ships are R-class, each with 16,000 tons. Class B ships are M-class, each with 11,000 tons. This time, the Class A ship "Rawalpindi," 16,640 tons, arrived in Shanghai from London, entered port on the 19th, and unloaded cargo and passengers. It then boarded passengers bound for Japan, and loaded goods transported from Europe to Japan. It departed Shanghai on the 21st, heading directly for the East.</p>
<p>Fire En Route: After the mail ship left Shanghai, it was scheduled to arrive in Moji tomorrow and then go to Kobe. However, when it reached the waters outside Wusongkou, a fire suddenly broke out in the ship's forward hold. Initially, there was smoke. The ship's master, Mr. Holland, was notified and immediately ordered the crew and sailors to use the fire-fighting equipment specially provided on the ship to extinguish the fire. It was found that there were not many goods in the forward hold, only scattered items, so the damage may not be too great. It is hoped that the fire can be extinguished before reaching Japan.</p>
<p>Telegraphing to Inquire About the Cause: The Shanghai office received the report and telegraphed the ship's master yesterday, ordering him to report the details. The ship's schedule is approved by the British government and cannot be changed without authorization. It is currently scheduled to return to Shanghai on July 11 and depart Shanghai for London on the 12th.</p>
<p>Sale of Old Ships: The company's original mail ships were mostly K-class ships of 9,000 tons. Now that the new ships are fully completed and in service, these old ships are slower and have fewer passenger seats. Therefore, it has been decided to sell them. The first ship, named "Carmora," used to sail between London and Shanghai. After unloading cargo in Shanghai yesterday, it immediately sailed to the East to be sold to a Japanese shipping company. After remodeling, it will sail to various ports in the East again.</p>

<h3>Road Association Promotes Road Maintenance Methods in Border Provinces</h3>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association believes that various provinces have been actively building roads recently, with remarkable results. However, road maintenance has not received enough attention, especially in the remote provinces and regions of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. The association sent a letter yesterday requesting that they instruct their respective road bureaus and long-distance bus companies to pay special attention to this issue to avoid hindering traffic, and attached the road maintenance methods of Henan Province for reference. The original letter is as follows: "Respected Sirs, Automobiles and highways are as interdependent as lips and teeth, and as connected as blood vessels. Therefore, vehicles must be purchased with caution, and road maintenance must not be taken lightly. Only then can automobiles travel for a long time, the speed can be increased, the income can be increased, and the losses can be reduced. Our association has been established for more than ten years, and its mission is to promote road and municipal policies and actively improve them. Thanks to the sympathy and cooperation of the transportation industry across the country, gradual improvements have been made, and we are deeply gratified for the future. However, we have found that although transportation in your province has improved and the number of open road sections has gradually increased, the road maintenance issue is still very important after the road construction is completed. Otherwise, cars can easily damage roads, roads can easily damage cars, and with the destruction of rain and the crushing of heavy loads, even concrete roads will not last long, let alone cinder, mud, gravel, uneven roads, which are more likely to be destroyed by each other with vehicles. Therefore, we specially request that your office examine and instruct all road bureaus and long-distance bus companies under your jurisdiction to check and implement the various road protection and maintenance methods that have been discussed by our association over the years, so as to avoid the suffering of uneven damage. All kinds of transport vehicles purchased will be able to be used for a long time and gain more profits. At the same time, attention should be paid to planting trees along the roadside to increase beauty and strengthen the road base. We especially hope to receive a reply, in addition to the enclosed copy of the Henan Highway Bureau's road maintenance methods for reference."</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Construction Department Orders Protection of Dike Works</h3>
<p>Investigations have revealed that the seawall projects in the counties of Jiangnan, Baotai, Songjiang and Changshu have been damaged and collapsed in the aftermath of the typhoon and tidal surge last autumn. If repairs are not urgently planned, the lives and properties of nearby people will have no guarantee. The Jiangsu Construction Department is concerned about the people's suffering and attaches importance to dike works. It is now undertaking the seawall relief project in accordance with the provincial government's mandate to strengthen the seawalls, and the provincial government has organized the Jiangnan Dike Works Relief Committee together with the Shanghai Municipal Government to assist in the handling. The project is now underway, with materials piled up and many workers. During this time of war, there are concerns that ignorant and foolish people may steal materials, which would not only hinder the dike works but also encroach on public funds. The department has strictly ordered the county magistrates to supervise their subordinates to protect the materials and assist as much as possible to ensure the smooth progress of the project.</p>
<h3>French Concession Municipal Council Imposes Business Tax on Hard Fuels</h3>
<p>All Coal Dealers Unite...To Achieve the Goal of Cancellation</p>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council has newly promulgated regulations for the management of hard fuels, including the collection of business tax. All coal dealers in the French Concession have expressed that they cannot afford the burden and have jointly submitted a petition to the Director-General, requesting that the order be revoked. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, the Municipal Council still sent staff yesterday to collect the tax from Huacheng Coal Ball Company on Zhengjia Muqiao Street and Xie Taixin Coal Company on Ganshi Dong Road. The coal dealers politely refused and stated that business is currently slow and they really cannot afford the tax. The tax collectors then produced official letters No. 5398 from the French Concession Municipal Council, and distributed them to the coal dealers, setting a deadline of June 25th for payment of the tax, otherwise the council will take the necessary measures, ordering all franchised companies and the council's departments to suspend the supply of water, electricity and other public services, etc. After receiving the letters, the coal dealers immediately convened a meeting to discuss the matter, and they were united, resolutely stating that they could not afford the tax and would achieve the goal of its cancellation. The letter is reproduced as follows: Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council Official Letter No. 5398. Respected Sirs, The business license fee for hard fuel stores that your company should pay has been repeatedly uncollected by the council's tax collection office. There is no further grace period. Please remit the license fee of three yuan on or before June 25th (Saturday), otherwise, the council will take the necessary measures, ordering all franchised companies and the council's departments to suspend the supply of water and electricity and other public services to your company. In addition, the council may separately prosecute for the collection of the license fee. Please note. Yours sincerely, Tramoulet, Director-General. Furthermore, the Temporary Committee of the Council of Directors has decided that in all cases where the council has to suspend the supply of water and electricity to tax resisters due to failure to pay taxes and license fees, the tax resisters will have to pay an additional connection fee of five taels of silver when requesting reconnection of water and electricity equipment.</p>
<h3>Damaged Guangdong Aircraft Transported Back for Repair</h3>
<p>Now Transported to Shanghai from Hankou</p>
<p>Guangdong Air Force Second Squadron's No. 5 fighter plane, during training at the end of last month, flew to the vicinity of Yichang in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River due to disorientation. Suddenly, the aircraft was damaged and crashed in Baiyang Town. The pilot and the fuselage were not damaged. The pilot telegraphed the Guangdong Air Force Headquarters. Squadron Leader Wu Ruliu was dispatched to the accident site to retrieve the plane. A passport was issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. At the beginning of this month, the aircraft was transported to Hankou and transferred to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Baohe ship to Shanghai for repair in Guangdong. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday (21st). It was originally scheduled to be shipped out on the Hesheng ship tomorrow (24th). However, because the passport from the Ministry of Military Affairs has not yet been issued, it will be temporarily kept in Shanghai. As soon as the passport is issued, it will be transported to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Shengjing Ship in Distress Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The Swire Group's Northern Shipping "Shengjing" ran aground on Qingming Island near Weihaiwei on the evening of the 12th of this month due to fog. The company entrusted the Dalian branch of the Japanese Salvage Company to rescue it. The branch sent personnel to the accident site to inspect it, used an electric grinder to remove the rocks that had penetrated into the cabin, and then used rubber and cement to coat and repair it. The ship was towed to Weihai by the Ningbo ship, etc., as reported in the previous newspapers. It is now learned that three holes were pierced in the bottom of the ship by the rocks, all in the fore and aft holds. The engine room and engine parts were undamaged. The ship was rescued by the Japanese Salvage Company and towed to Weihai for minor repairs. Yesterday, the local Shanghai Swire Group received a telegram from the Shengjing ship stating that it left Weihaiwei for Shanghai this morning (22nd) and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning. It will enter the dock for repairs as soon as it arrives in Shanghai. It is expected to be completed in about a month. It is reported that the ship was insured in advance, so the company did not suffer any losses in this accident.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of Qingyun Road Bombing</h3>
<p>Shopkeeper Provides Generous Compensation to Deceased and Injured Dyers</p>
<p>Pan Acha, Wang Binglin, Xu Jinquan, etc., dyers at the Jiuda Dyeing Factory on Zhabei Tiantong'an Road, were killed on the morning of the 14th of this month at 10:00 AM when a rag-picker child from Jiangbei accidentally triggered the detonator of a bomb while they were drying cloth on the grassland across from the World Theater on Qingyun Road. Details have been reported in the newspaper. It is now learned that the deceased dyers were all natives of Shaoxing, Zhejiang. They had elderly parents and wives and children who depended on their work to make a living. After hearing the news, they came to Shanghai overnight for the funeral, and their feelings were very tragic. It is reported that the factory owner, Shao Shifu, is also a fellow native of Zhejiang. In addition to running the dyeing business in Shanghai, he also opened the Jiudachang Cloth Shop at the corner of Shilu Road on Beijing Road. In recent years, both stores have been very successful. Shao is even more benevolent and compassionate, and deeply sympathizes with the dyers who died tragically in the line of duty. In particular, the factory is located in Zhabei. During the war, all the pigments, cloth, tools, and sundries in the store, estimated to be worth more than 100,000 yuan, were moved out by the dyers at the risk of their lives, so they did not suffer any damage. Their contributions were the greatest. Mr. Shao remembers their past contributions and sympathizes with their tragic experiences, and will give them generous compensation. As for the dyers Chen Changqing and Zhang Aqing, who were injured by the bomb at the time, although they did not lose their lives, they have been disabled. It is reported that they will be given old-age pensions to extend their remaining lives.</p>
<h3>French Concession Municipal Council Levies Excise Tax on Solid Fuels</h3>
<p>All Coal Merchants Unite...To Achieve Cancellation</p>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council has newly promulgated regulations for the management of solid fuels, including the collection of business tax. All coal merchants in the French Concession have expressed that they cannot afford the burden and have jointly submitted a petition to the Director-General, requesting that the order be revoked. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, the Municipal Council still sent staff yesterday to collect the tax from Huacheng Coal Ball Company on Zhengjia Muqiao Street and Xie Taixin Coal Company on Ganshi Dong Road.

<h3>Chief Culprit of Kidnapping Case of Yan Zizhang, He Dade, Apprehended</h3>
<p>He Dade from Ningbo, on the night of July 16th of the 18th year [of the Republic], colluded with Jiang Huixing, Li Afu, etc., in front of the Dadong Hotel on Yinghua Street, Nanjing Road, kidnapped Yan Zizhang, demanding a huge ransom. Subsequently, the police apprehended the two bandits Jiang and Li, and after interrogation in court, they were punished. At that time, because He Dade had escaped without a trace, the police notified both the Chinese and French authorities to cooperate in the arrest. It has been three years since then. Now, Chief Inspectorate detectives Ma Mouxiang and Zhao Rongsheng discovered that the bandit He was hiding in house number four of Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, in the French Concession. Therefore, the other day, they, together with French Concession detectives, rushed to the location and apprehended He. Yesterday, he was brought to the First Special District District Court, where Judge Qian conducted the interrogation. Because the police lawyer Ru Baoyi believed that the case still required further investigation, he requested an extension of the hearing. Judge Qian granted the request and the defendant Xu was taken back to the police station for detention, with the hearing rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Gold Shop Shareholders Accuse General Manager of Embezzlement Case Judgement</h3>

The case has been concluded. Yesterday morning, Criminal Court President Qian Hongye presided over the first criminal court and announced the verdict. The main text stated that Shi Zian and Tian Hongnian were jointly found guilty of breach of trust, and each was fined one thousand yuan. If the fine is not fully paid after mandatory execution, it will be commuted to one day of imprisonment for every three yuan, to be served in prison. The part concerning Song Fuchen was not accepted.

<h3>Kidnapped Child Encounters Kidnappers on the Road</h3>
<p>Kidnappers Forced Child to Call Them Father</p>
<p>A few days ago, Chinese and Western detectives from the Hongkou Police Station cracked down on a kidnapping gang selling children in the Xinfakezhan Inn at number 62 Wuhu Road, rescuing 11 boys on the spot and arresting the ringleader, Wang Xi, a man from Fujian, along with seven men and women. They were handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Among the kidnapped children was a boy named Ma Xiaoqun from Henan, only seven years old. His father, Ma Jiyuan, found out and went to the police station yesterday to claim his child. After confirming the identity, the head of the police released the child to his father. While walking along Robison Road, Ma Deqing, a man from Henan, was identified by the child Ma Xiaoqun as someone who had held him back at his house after being kidnapped and forced him to call him father. He was immediately turned over to Chinese detective Zhao Lianbi and taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation by the head of the police, he was ordered to be detained and investigated together with Wang and others.</p>
<h3>Ni Qiaoying Willingly Becomes Someone's Concubine</h3>
<p>And Claims Everything Was Voluntary</p>
<p>The World's Customs Are Declining, Concealed Love Is Possible</p>
<p>Ni Qiaoying, a 17-year-old girl from Pudong, resides at number 180, Xianghongkou. Her father, Ni Amao, has always been a vegetable vendor, but the girl's mother died early, and her stepmother, Chen, inevitably had disagreements with her, leading to mistreatment. On March 16th of this year, Qiaoying went out alone and never returned home. Her father, Amao, searched everywhere for her without any trace. It wasn't until the other day that he learned that Qiaoying had been abducted by Pan Zhengfu from Jiangbei and was living with him in house number 268, Wuzhou Road, cohabiting like husband and wife. He reported this to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest Pan and brought him and Qiaoying to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District District Court, where Judge Xu Bingrong conducted the interrogation. The police lawyer stated the case, saying that the defendant used to be a patrolman and is now a road worker. Ni Qiaoying met the defendant last winter and a love affair developed. However, there was no improper conduct yet. Recently, because the girl's stepmother, Chen, mistreated her, Qiaoying went out on that day and went to a hotel with the defendant on Kunming Road. After discussing it, the next day, they rented a house in the Chinese area of Zhabei and cohabited for about a week. Because the expenses were quite high, he tricked Qiaoying into staying at his house at number 286, Wuzhou Road, but the defendant already had a wife, Li, and three children. Li saw her husband bring Qiaoying home and stay in the same room. She originally wanted to report it to the police, but after discussing it with her father, Li Xiaobin, she temporarily endured it, preparing procedures to deal with Pan Zhengfu and file for divorce, so that she would have concrete evidence. Only yesterday did she secretly report it to the police and have the defendant arrested, and so on. Then, Ni Qiaoying, wearing a printed calico shirt, black silk trousers, silk stockings, and satin shoes, with her hair not cut and tied in a long braid, with some beauty and a tough attitude, without any shyness, claimed that because she was mistreated by her stepmother, she left home in a fit of anger, told the defendant about it, and asked him to introduce her [to someone]. I used to work in an egg factory and had a relationship with the defendant. We were both willing and went home with him to live together, willingly becoming a concubine, and so on. When questioned, the defendant confessed that Ni Qiaoying was being abused by her stepmother, ran away from home, and asked me to find a way to help her. There was no seduction. Moreover, I already have a wife and rely on her to make a living, and so on. Then, Chen complained that Qiaoying was not her biological daughter, but she did not abuse her. She ran away privately on that day. Her father found out and became ill, and has not fully recovered, so he could not come to court today. After Judge Shen verified the confession, he lectured Ni Qiaoying for being shameless, told her to go home with Chen, and instructed Chen not to abuse her. He then sentenced Pan Zhengfu to six months in prison, suspended for three and a half years, and prohibited him from having any improper conduct with Qiaoying in the future, otherwise he would be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Record of the Dongting Dongshan Fellow Association</h3>
<p>The Dongting Dongshan Fellow Association in Shanghai previously reported that Han Jizhi, the district chief of the 17th district of Dongshan, violated the law and harmed the people, intimidating the financial committee member and handing over the public funds to himself, falsely claiming it was a confiscation. The general meeting was convened, and it was publicly decided to elect representatives to return to the mountain to form a financial review committee with local impartial people. Ye Boliang and others were publicly elected as seven members of the committee and submitted to the county for approval. Unexpectedly, the district chief tried to cover up his difficulties and secretly instructed Zhao Yinzai and other individuals to form another association in an attempt to resist. After sending personnel back to the mountain to investigate and verify the facts, the chairman Zhu Xianhuai reported the information during the executive committee meeting of the fellow association the other day. Everyone believed that the district chief had many lawsuits and had embezzled public funds, which was intolerable. It was publicly decided to send a letter to the review committee to fairly investigate and pursue the matter, and to invite lawyer Xi Yuchang as the legal advisor of the association. The meeting then discussed the security problems of Dongshan. Everyone believed that although the lake bandits were rampant, fortunately, the members of the Dongshan security regiment already numbered 120 people (only 10 people in the front mountain), together with the 70+ people recruited by Ye Zhongzhongjia, the strength was sufficient, and the defense was effective. In addition, Zhang Jisheng, the captain of the 8th Water Police Team, was serious in his suppression and repeatedly captured bandits, rescuing kidnapped victims, and the bandit atmosphere gradually subsided. It was publicly decided that a silver shield and plaque should be publicly presented to Captain Zhang as a reward. Finally, the meeting discussed the dredging of the river. It was publicly decided to submit the plan and survey chart based on the actual survey conducted by Chairman Zhu to the Water Conservancy Bureau to start dredging.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read in your newspaper's news column about the tragic killing of the pawnshop owner and his partner in Yangshupu Road, and there are some discrepancies. The real name of the pawnshop owner, Mr. Xiongjün, is actually Yongjun, and he is from Chaozhou. He has two pawnshops in Shanghai. The murderer of the tragic case in the Qingfu Pawnshop is Weng Yongjun's own son. The tragically killed Jiang Zhenfang was originally from Huangshekeng, Qimen. He was the deputy cashier in the pawnshop. He had just entered the pawnshop on the first day of the fifth lunar month. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 18th of the sixth month of the national calendar, he was tragically killed, without receiving half a month's salary. I have a close relative relationship with the deceased Jiang Zhenfang and know his family background. Zhenfang lost his father at an early age, and his family was poor. He was newly married last summer, and there was an old mother in the hall. The family of several people depended entirely on Zhenfang alone to make a living. Now that I suddenly hear the bad news from afar, they will inevitably be grief-stricken. I have always admired your newspaper for its advocacy of justice, so I send this letter, hoping that you will publish it in the letter column to clarify the truth. I wish you peace.</p>
<p>June 22nd, I, Fang Peiqing, respectfully.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Aphorisms of the 93-Year-Old Ma Xiangbo</p>
<h3>The Science of Local Products</h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>During the Guangxu period, we only saw the application of electricity. Now it has become a world of electricity everywhere. "Electrification" is the most fashionable term of the present age, but who could have foreseen it decades ago? (Editor's note: Soviet + electrification = brand new Bolshevism. Electrification has become a major component of establishing doctrine.)</p>
<p>We discovered the experience of electricity in the Han Dynasty, but we didn't pursue it. We had to wait until many years later for Westerners to show off. How shameful is this!</p>
<p>Recently, the invention of radio has progressed rapidly, becoming more and more mysterious. I heard that a certain place in the United States is building a large-scale construction project. Everywhere in this vast construction area, they are searching and digging, but they have not found it. Later, they sent someone to France to consult a radio expert. This expert said:</p>
<p>"It's very easy. Just know the longitude and latitude of this construction area, and I can use radio to test it." This expert lived in Paris and was able to determine the location of the underground water thousands of miles away in the United States. Isn't this a miracle? Does Cao Jun Zhongyuan also know the details?</p>
<p>I think that if Chinese science is to develop, science must become a local product. We must never always use imported goods to decorate our door frames. In other words, we must invent and manufacture ourselves. Then science can become the science of local products, and China can become a scientific country. Cao Jun has a heart for it, encourage yourself.</p>
<h3>Zeng Bu</h3>
<p>— Jun Shuo</p>
<p>Reading Nie Taifu's saying on frugality and patriotism, at the same time, I thought of Zeng Bu. When Zeng Wenzheng Gong served as imperial envoy, co-handling the post of grand secretary and governor-general of Liangjiang, the arrow coat he wore was made of Linzhuang cloth produced in Henan Province. In terms of people, his morality, learning, writing, and career were unparalleled. In terms of position, he was also a general and minister. Once he advocated cloth clothing, all his subordinates and staff wore robes of Linzhuang cloth, which became a fashion. Linzhuang cloth not only sold well in Jiangsu, but also sold well in various provinces. Especially because things were valued for their association with people, people at the time changed the name of Linzhuang cloth to Zeng Bu because it was advocated by Zeng Gong. From this, I can infer that if our country wants to save today's economic crisis, promote domestic goods, not use foreign goods, and preserve the national essence of frugality, it is not an impossible task. It only requires someone who is respected and trusted by the people to sincerely advocate it. Zeng Bu is mostly cyan gray, and the width is only a little over a foot. Each piece of robe material is rolled into a roll, about three zhang. This is the special point of Zeng Bu, which is different from other types of cloth. Recently, in cloth shops in major cities, when asked, there is no such cloth. Those who are in their fifties and do cloth business can still know the name, but they say that they have not sold this cloth for more than 20 years. As for the young cloth shop partners, when asked about Linzhuang cloth Zeng Bu, they ask if it is from England, America, France, or the United States. They have long forgotten the name, let alone the good story that was popular throughout the country that day. Alas, how regrettable. Nie Taifu was the youngest daughter of Zeng Wenzheng Gong. The other day, Hui Jun wrote about the affairs of Madame Ji, saying that Zeng was the second daughter, which was a mistake. On the day Zeng Wenzheng died, she was not yet married. At that time, Nie Gong Zhongfang, the husband of Madame Tai, wrote a eulogy for Wenzheng, calling himself a visiting nephew, see Rong'ai Lu. Also, according to Zeng Wenzheng Gong's family letters, one daughter married the son of Yuan Shuliu, and one daughter married the son of Guo Yunxian. Each time a daughter was married, two hundred taels of silver were stipulated. Although prices were low at the time, being from the family of a general and minister, they were so frugal, their vision was far-reaching.</p>
<h3>A Proof That Man Can Conquer Nature</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>To be blind, deaf, and mute in one body, this can truly be said to be the most useless person in the world. However, there is a person who has these three diseases, but their heart is not blind, not deaf, not mute. Using this little bit of soul, cultivate their instinct and expand it. They can conquer nature and compete with those who are smart, bright, and eloquent. Even surpass them. Is this not an extraordinary person in the world? Who is she? American Ms. Helen Keller. Ms. Keller was born for nineteen months, suffered a severe illness, and became blind, deaf, and mute. At the age of seventeen, she was educated by Ms. Su Liwen. At that time, her official sense was only the remaining two of smell and touch. When she grew up, she was able to speak. Now she is fifty-two years old and has become a well-known writer in the United States. Ms. Keller is naturally intelligent, and her sense of touch is particularly sharp. When she touches an object, she can say its general outline. She can also use touch to know a person's personality. She once said that she touched a soft hand and knew that the person was a priest. Touched a heavy hand and knew that the person was a humorist. Touched a shy hand and knew that the person was a hypocritical brave person. Touched an iron fist and knew that the person was a polite person. Ms. Keller loves swimming and rowing and is proficient in manual typewriters. Whenever she is free, she uses her ten fingers to make gestures and talk to people. She also lightly touches the lips and throat of the person she is talking to, and can understand the meaning of their speech. Therefore, doctors throughout Europe admire Ms. Keller's genius. However, Ms. Keller's proficiency in foreign languages and obtaining a degree in mathematics is something that no one can imagine. According to Su Liwen, Ms. Keller can speak. One day, I took Helen to the pumping room. I ordered her to hold a cup to hold water. When the cup was full, I held Helen's other hand and made the word water in her palm. Water. At that time, the water in the cup overflowed. Helen was stimulated by the cold, and she stood like a stone man, throwing the cup and standing as if struck by lightning. Her face showed a strange look. She spelled the word water several times. This was the beginning of her ability to speak. Alas, who would have thought that this girl would later be able to receive a university education, become famous in the literary world, and become one of the great reformers in the United States today with a great fearless spirit and a talent for eloquence. After completing her studies, Ms. Keller devoted herself to the cause of seeking happiness for the deaf and blind. The kindness of her books is revealed in the lines between the words. The famous writer Mark Twain once said that the most exciting figures of the 19th century were only Napoleon and Helen Keller. Ms. Keller recently took the President Roosevelt liner from New York to Scotland to receive an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow. Her success story is enough to inspire disabled youths to work hard. Someone asked Ms. Keller, if one day her blind eyes suddenly became clear, what would she want to see first? Ms. Keller replied that first children and then dogs. This alone is enough to see Ms. Keller's mind.</p>
<h3>Record of a Famous Painting's Calamity</h3>
<p>— Jin Yang</p>
<p>Shi Guzi, Wang Hui, became famous in his generation for his paintings. In his later years, his brushwork became even more divine. He had surpassed the ordinary and entered the realm of the saintly, his heart and hand in complete harmony. The depth of his artistic achievement could be directly compared to the masterpieces of the Jin, Song, and Yuan dynasties, far exceeding the standards of his contemporaries. Therefore, even fragments of his silk paintings were treasured like rare jewels by those who obtained them. My friend, Mr. Lu, possessed a scroll of "Landscape After Rain and Snow," imitating the style of Li Cheng. The mountain ranges were rugged, and the cold forests were dense. The nearby ridges and distant peaks were as white as jade. Furthermore, the reeds by the water, the passenger boats, and fishing vessels added a touch of secluded charm. The entire painting was rendered in ink wash, with light colors applied. (It was once published in "Continuation of Famous Paintings from the Xu Zhai Studio"). The painting was originally collected by Mr. Lu's maternal grandfather. During the turmoil of the Hongyang Rebellion, he had no time to worry about his family fortune. He only took this painting with him when he fled and managed to survive by luck. Its fame, value, and the affection he had for it were quite evident. When it was passed down to Mr. Lu, it had not suffered any damage. He had taken it with him to avoid danger during every crisis. This time, when the Japanese invaders suddenly attacked the city, Mr. Lu's residence was located in Jiangwan. At first, he thought that because it was in a remote and peaceful area, he might be spared. Unexpectedly, the ruthless iron birds roamed freely, and an unfeeling bomb landed on Mr. Lu's house. A loud explosion erupted, and his family fled for their lives in a hurry, without taking anything with them. From afar, they could only watch as the famous painting and furniture were consumed by the raging flames, collected and stored by the God of Fire. After recovering from the shock, Mr. Lu remembered the painting and sighed sadly. Although material possessions could be replaced, the famous painting could never be recovered. What a pity.</p>
<h3>Words of Ms. Chen Yumei</h3>
<p>— Zou Sheng</p>
<p>Ever since watching "Yunlan, the Girl," I have developed the same fondness for the leading actress, Ms. Chen Yumei, as I have for Ms. En Hating, the lead in "Lily of the Valley." Her tranquil performance is truly worthy of making people abandon the fanaticism of Clara Bow and immerse themselves in another kind of humorous taste. Recently, I visited the Tianyi Photography Studio to observe their filming and had a ten-minute conversation with Ms. Chen, which was both sweet and deeply meaningful.</p>
<p>I asked her which female stars of Hollywood she admired. Ms. Chen listed a large number of them, including Lillian Gish, Ruth Chatterton, Janet Gaynor, and of course, the newly emerging Ms. En Hating. She also said, "I don't like McDonald's affectation."</p>
<p>Like an orchid, Ms. Chen has no traces of extravagance, arrogance, or clamorous negativity. She was wearing a cloth robe, without any makeup, sitting quietly in a corner of the studio. When I talked about the success of "Yunlan, the Girl," she humbly smiled and said, "In sound films, this is indeed my adventurous attempt; but I believe that I will be able to satisfy the audience even more in 'One Night of Luxury' because the plot in 'One Night of Luxury' has truly stimulated me deeply."</p>
<p>She also talked about her own life, saying, "Working in film is the happiest and also the most difficult thing. Before 'One Night of Luxury' started filming, I studied the plot and dialogues in the script thoroughly for more than two weeks: Filming sound films requires sufficient preparation. So after 'One Night of Luxury' started filming, I was ultimately more satisfied."</p>
<p>That night, they were filming another "Tianyi Entertainment Show," which was an exceptionally lively musical film that everyone enjoyed watching. Ms. Chen smiled and said to me, "But, please come and watch 'One Night of Luxury,' and you will shed tears of sympathy for the characters in the film after extreme happiness." Then, she fell silent again. In this corner of the studio, I gained another kind of serene beauty.</p>
<h3>New Arsenal (Part 2)</h3>

<h3>Record of Ma Shuanglou (87)</h3>
<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Gazing at the Official Banners in a Remote and Small County, A Crowd of Vulgar People Follow the Attendants</p>
<p>It is said that in a coastal area, there was a county town the size of a peck measure, called Haiding County. Although geographically it was bordered by mountains and sea, its transportation was blocked. There were no ships to the sea and no railways to the land, so it was isolated in a remote corner of the sea, and people had always regarded it as a barren and small county. To the south of the county town, only twenty or so miles from the coast, was a vast and boundless plain, similar to a beach. The salty air was constantly evaporated by the scorching sun, and no crops could grow, and no trees could grow. Apart from engaging in the meager profits of fishing and salt making, the residents had practically no other production. Also, in the northeast and west directions, the area was about a hundred square miles, but it was full of chaotic peaks and dense bushes. This provided endless convenience for the green forest heroes who arose in this chaotic world to move in and out and rely on them on weekdays. If only looking at this situation, this Haiding County should be the most difficult county to govern. The general staff in the provincial capital who were planning to be magistrates would regard this as a difficult position. Some people were hesitant and unwilling to go forward. But the reality was just the opposite. All the magistrates who came here to do the county work came with clean sleeves and went away with money in their pockets. They would never work hard and do nothing. Therefore, it was passed down that it was a particularly lucrative position that was bittersweet. Because the magistrate's income was good, it affected the spirit of the land from the outstanding people, and even dragged this small county town to present an unexpected prosperity. In total, there was a dilapidated and collapsing low brick city, only six or seven miles around. Inside the city, there was only one street in front of the county government office, with shops lined up in a row. The rest was still very desolate. It had gathered all the unique prosperity of the city on this street. If the prosperity was carefully dissected, it was still a kind of deformed development. Most of the shops with booming business and smooth operation belonged to the nature of luxury, such as restaurants, opera houses that sang miscellaneous dramas, foreign general merchandise shops that specialized in selling imported silk fabrics, clocks, and pills, and dark doors that secretly housed prostitutes and local prostitutes. Everything that should be there was there. It even had a small prototype of modern material civilization. In addition, there was another very peculiar feature, that is, the inns that catered to passing merchants were unusually numerous. On that bustling street, there were more than a dozen inns that were called new civilized hotels. The old-fashioned small inns scattered in the nearby alleys were even more numerous. It was precisely because of these inns that they accommodated so many passing merchants that they could revitalize the market in the county town and make the street have a bustling and lively atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Very Ordinary</h3>
<p>Slight Advances and Retreats with a Tendency to Soften The price of gold yesterday was very mediocre, with a softening trend and no major ups and downs. It often hovered around 732-3 taels, with only 3 taels of rotation throughout the day. As a result, it fell slightly by one tael and a little, and market sentiment seemed weak. It fell as soon as it opened in the morning, and because the silver market rose and the US dollar was flat, it was greatly affected by the exchange rate. Since then, exchange rates such as the US dollar have changed slightly, and the transactions of various numbers have been different, so the price sometimes fluctuates by 2 taels. The afternoon was even more tired, and the after-market was very deserted, with only slight ups and downs. Because the foreign exchange market was closed on Wednesday, it hovered around 33 taels. The transfer period was only 4 taels and 45 qian, and was still mainly led by the bulls. It is said that there were still about 9,000 contracts that had not been traded.

Large bars rose again by one-sixteenth, the silver price did not change, but the private telegraph slightly went down by one-eighth. The European market was quite flat, and the US side rarely saw activity, and because the US had news of buying raw silver and minting silver coins, market sentiment tended to be low. There was then a fluctuation of 1 tael, and Dalian Gang and Hengxing bought in, and it rose again by more than 1 tael, to 33 taels and 4 qian. However, goods package and Yongfeng Yuhe and other sold out, and because Makali and other sold July US dollar 375, the price immediately fell by 2 taels, to 31 taels and 4 qian. Then it gradually added more than 1 tael, and Hengxing Zhifeng Yongbing Xingyuanchun and other bought in, and Ho and Sumitomo made July US dollar 375, Andada and Sumitomo made October 8125, causing the price to return to 33 taels. At 9:30, the preliminary order was announced to be unchanged, and the US dollar was increased by 125, which was a large exchange rate spread. However, the gold market was not affected. Citibank bought July US dollar 275, so at this time it was 33 taels and 8 qian. Then it slightly went down to 2 taels and 6 qian, goods and Wujing Yongqian Changxiang Fuyu and other bought in, and Mitsui sucked October US dollar 75, and the market situation was revitalized, to 34 taels and 2 qian at 9:45. Later, because HSBC issued September British gold 183125, and Yuanmao Yong Zhifeng Yong Yuhe Yuanchun Yicheng and other also had sales, the price was cut by 2 taels, until about 10:30 it was 32 taels and 1 qian, but in half an hour there were only a few qian commission fees, and soon Yuanxing Yongqian Changxiang Yifeng Yong and other bought in, and the price of Mo gold in this month was 1875, the price of US dollars was 3125, and the gold price rose by more than 1 tael in an instant, 33 taels and 8 qian at 10:40. Later, because the US dollar for this month was 375, and HSBC came out in August by half yuan, Yongfeng Hongkang Yongyuan Mao Yong Yuantai Yuanxing Yong and other have sold out, and the price showed a tired look again, 31 taels and 2 qian at 11:15, and then pulled up more than 1 tael, because HSBC bought June US dollar 375, but when it sold out in August by half yuan, and because Daxing Yong Zhifeng Yongyuan Da Yong Yuhe and other all had sales, it was still in a tired state, and 31 taels finally at 11:50, Tong Taichang Chunyuan Yongyuan Mao goods package and other took this opportunity to pursue, so the price raised 1 tael 34 qian, and the afternoon closed at 32 taels and 4 qian, and continued to do more than 3 taels, so the goods did 1 tael and 1 qian,</p>
<p>The After-Market Was Extremely Desolate After the market opened at 33 taels and 1 qian, it carried the residual wind of the afternoon close, followed by 3 taels and 3 qian, Hengxing first sold out, and immediately went downstream to 32 taels and 1 qian, Yongfeng and retail investors bought in, and immediately increased by 1 tael, 33 taels and 2 qian at 2:45, Hengxing still came out at 3:00 at 32 taels and 5 qian, and was sucked up by goods package and other, and the price rose, until about 4:00 at 33 taels and 6 qian, and then it was extremely peaceful, and there were very few transactions.

<h3>New York Stock Market Still Listless</h3>
<p>(American East Bank Report)</p>
<p>The New York stock market on Tuesday was still very light in transactions, and the market price continued to show a tired trend. There were very few transactions in the previous market. Later, because of the news that "American Metallurgical Company" stopped paying interest on preferred shares, the selling sentiment suddenly prevailed, and the industrial stocks fell by 1.22 pounds, which was the largest. Railway and public stocks fell less, but the "American Telephone and Telegraph" stock fell to a new low of 79 yuan 875 yesterday, with the previous lowest price being 81 yuan 25. The Board of Directors of American Metallurgical Company, in view of the recent low prices of minerals, decided to stop paying official interest on preferred shares in order to increase the company's cash reserves. At this time of cold sentiment, only this news affected the stock market. The points of attention in the trading circle are the national financial balance problem internally and the Lausanne Conference externally. Before these two matters are effectively resolved, it will be difficult for the stock market to turn around. Attached Dow Jones Index as left,</p>

<h3>Buyers of Cotton Yarn Express Instability</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was flat in the morning and down in the afternoon, showing a very weak trend. It has been supported for many days, but the surrounding environment is not good, making it difficult for buyers to maintain their position, thus showing signs of instability and wavering. However, some parties remain firm and have no intention of cutting losses. In short, the overall global trend is sluggish, and it is difficult to change people's sentiments. However, the recent continuous decline has been very rapid. If it breaks through the 40 tael mark, there may be a period of consolidation, which is also unknown. However, the current demand for yarn is still weak, and all parties are affected by the economy and show no signs of excitement. It is said that the price of cotton yarn has fallen by 16 taels and 7 maces compared to the high price period.</p>
<p>Most bulls cut losses in the futures market. The opening of the futures market was flat due to American cotton, but sellers continued to flood the market. Prices rose and fell in each month. As a result, prices rose by 3, 5, and 6 maces in each month. In the afternoon, due to bulls closing their positions, the market fell again by 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 maces. The total transaction volume for the day was 23,300 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 1,550 bales, Yiyu 1,000 bales, Xiesheng 1,200 bales, and Yichang 550 bales. Yida bought 1,000 bales, Yiyu 1,000 bales, Xiesheng 700 bales, Senkang 550 bales, and Tonghe 550 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Futures Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance</p>
<p>October 14.05 Down 1.25 8,850</p>
<p>July 14.20 Down 1.4 17,800 November 14.05 1.1 55,850</p>
<p>August 14.09 1.2 36,100 Total 217,750</p>
<p>September 14.04 1.2 49,500</p>
<p>Demand for Spot Yarn Remains Weak. Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. It was found that various guilds bought a total of 500 bales throughout the day. Fellow traders bought 35 bales, with prices falling by 5.5 to 7.5 maces. Guest traders from Guangdong bought 45 bales, inland 145 bales, Sichuan 90 bales, Fujian 15 bales, Wuhu 10 bales, Luzhou 50 bales, Yunnan 80 bales, Shantou 5 bales, and Xiamen 5 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Under Renewed Selling Pressure</h3>
<p>The cotton market is under renewed selling pressure. Due to stagnant real demand, factories had already absorbed a large amount of foreign cotton last year. As a result, domestic cotton has been encroached upon, and factories have enough supply for seven or eight months. According to those from Shandong, there are still 800,000 piculs of cotton in storage there, mostly fine-staple cotton. There is ample cotton in storage in the north, and a large amount has not been transported out, so market prices have plummeted. Under these circumstances, a cotton merchant in Shanghai still mentioned the possibility of a squeeze in July, spreading rumors in the market. However, the yarn market is plummeting, and raw materials cannot be supported. It is said that the China Trade Corporation sold another 5,000 piculs in the morning market. The future of the cotton market is still difficult to be stable.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Falls by 3-4 Mace. The opening of Zheng Biao was good due to the slight rise in American cotton, and sentiment was still good. However, large traders sold off, and prices fell by 2-3 maces in each month. In the afternoon, due to the weak yarn market, prices fell by another 1.5 maces. The total transaction volume for the day was 35,100 piculs. It was found that Dejiang sold 3,000 piculs, Yichang 4,100 piculs, Tongfu 1,600 piculs, and Jifeng 1,100 piculs. Huaida Ji bought 2,000 piculs, Tianlong 1,000 piculs, Changhe 1,700 piculs, and Rongxing 1,500 piculs. The closing prices of Zheng Biao are listed below: Zheng Biao Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance October 28.40 Down 4.5 141,000</p>
<p>July 27.95 Down 3.5 58,600 November 28.75 3.5 154,400</p>
<p>August 28.25 3.0 104,200 Total 458,200</p>
<p>The Consumption of Spot Cotton is Extremely Sparse. The spot cotton business is quiet, and the market has turned weak again. Yao cotton arrived at 1,200 bales.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton 29.50 Litai Bought 128 Bales Spot Warehouse Delivery</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Telegram Reports Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to pest reports, but then weakened due to the slump on Wall Street. Futures rose by 3 to 4 points, and spot rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 10 to 11 points, and spot rose by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 10 points. Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (21st dispatch):</p>

<h3>Grain Market: Rice Market Showing Signs of Looseness</h3>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday's rice market saw the arrival of sources from the 14th and 15th in the west, and the demand from urban and rural shops was healthier than in the previous market. Regular Changshu and Wuxi customers bought 500 dan, and the price increased by 5 cents. Early Bo rice arrivals were abundant, but demand was weak, and the opening price was reduced by 1 dime. Foreign Luxian tip rice was sold as it arrived, and the market showed no ups and downs. Bianyin Yuan arrived yesterday with two bags, totaling 400 dan, and wine merchants bought all of them.</p>
<p>Shanghai North: Yesterday's sources from various guilds were from the 26th and 27th. Trading on this street felt increasingly quiet. The fresh market for Changzhou and Wuxi white japonica rice was settled, but there was no demand for Zhongguan rice. The feet of the Bo rice Feilaifeng rice were slightly fine, and the price was weak by 2 dimes. The remaining goods were sold at a break-even point, showing signs of going downstream. The total number of dan opened throughout the day was around 2,200 to 2,300.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Prices Fall and Sales Increase</h3>
<p>Prices Fall by a Small Dime and Local Customers All Have Arrangements for Packaging</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice continued to fall by a small dime. Trading was quiet in the morning, with only 500 bags of Xiaojiao rice opened. Prices fell and sales increased in the afternoon, with over 2,000 bags of various rice opened. The market turned from weak to stable, but the future market is still difficult to be optimistic about. The inventory is too large, and there must be large customers to take the goods before a turnaround can occur. The buyers yesterday were Zhenjiang, Nanjing, inland, and local customers, who continued to purchase after a successful trial purchase the day before. If subsequent batches can be successfully sold, the demand in the future will gradually develop, and the market conditions and prices will gradually improve. A total of over 2,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were opened in the market and bought by Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and local customers. Local customers also bought 700 bags of No. 1 Zhongguan Saigon rice, priced at 11 yuan 1 dime and a half to 11 yuan, and 200 bags of Hongda Xiaojiao rice, priced at 9 yuan 2 dimes and a half. Inland customers bought 500 bags of Wenzhou coarse rice, priced at 8 yuan 5 dimes and 8 cents. Prices fell by about 1 dime each.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Driven by Customer Sales</h3>
<p>Tianjin Traders Bought 90,000 Bags of Spot Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw prices fall by 2-3 cents in the morning after the opening due to the decline in the price of foreign wheat and the clear weather, which led to weak sentiment. July and August prices fell to 1 tael 8 maces 2 cents and 7.5 li, about 1.5 cents lower than the previous day. However, demand was still active, and customer traders made some transactions, so prices gradually improved. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was still flat and weak at first, but after the second session, Fuxin opened a large batch of spot flour, which was separately purchased by Tianjin traders and sent directly to Tianjin, priced at 1 tael 9 maces and 3 cents, totaling 90,000 bags (excluding the water discount, the actual price was only about 1 tael 8 maces). Due to the active customer sales, sentiment suddenly surged, and July prices rose to 8 maces 4 cents and 7.5 li, August prices rose to 8 maces 5 cents and 7.5 li, September prices rose to 8 maces 6 cents and a half, October prices rose to 8 maces 7 cents and 2.5 li, and November prices rose to 8 maces 8 cents, up 2-3 cents from the lowest price. However, after the fifth session, Fufeng sold off, and prices fell by another 1.5 cents. As a result, July was 2.5 li better than the previous day, August was 5 li better, September was 2.5 li better, October was unchanged, and November was 5 li better.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Extremely Peaceful</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was generally stable in the morning and afternoon after the opening. Although foreign wheat prices fell by 2-3 cents, and the weather was clear, local traders still bought in at low prices due to certain relationships. Although sellers are also gradually releasing their positions, they must have spot goods in reserve due to the low prices to avoid fluctuations. However, the flour mills are abundant, and the new wheat is not supported, which inevitably leads to hidden worries in the future. As a result, July was unchanged, August was 1 cent better, September was unchanged, October was 2 cents better, and November was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Russian Firm Opens Trade in Gongxi Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Russian Cooperative Foreign Firm invited various tea firms to negotiate on Gongxi green tea from Yuantong Road. It was heard that the Russian firm quoted a price of 48-49 taels to 50 taels, which the Chinese side considered too low, and a new price has not yet been offered. However, this has already attracted the close attention of foreign traders, and it is said that telegrams have been sent to Mumbai, Persia, Afghanistan, and other places to promote sales. As for Zhenmei green tea, high-grade goods remain unchanged, and low-grade goods continue to be sold at a fixed price. In addition, there were scattered transactions of needle-shaped pearl tea and Keemun black tea.</p>
<h3>Swiss Silk Sales Decline</h3>
<p>British India Imposes Import Tax on Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Sales of Silk Fabrics Suddenly Become Stagnant</p>
<p>Swiss-produced silk fabrics rely on sales to Britain and India. Now that the governments of Britain and India have imposed a 20% import tax on silk fabrics, sales of Swiss silk fabrics have suddenly become stagnant, and consumption of raw silk has declined. As a result, telegrams from Shanghai Zhonghe, Xinshixing, and Shenyu to Switzerland have rarely been forwarded to Shanghai in recent days, and European sales of Chinese silk are increasingly hopeless.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Sugar Prices Quite Strong</h3>
<p>Coarse Granulated White Sugar Market Gradually Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw active trading in the market council's price setting. Dutch No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar market gradually rose, with a transaction price of 14 taels and 1 mace. Hong Kong goods were priced at 13 taels and 9 maces, and supplies were short. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was priced at 13 taels and 6 maces, and No. 9 Dutch red sugar was priced at 9 taels and 9 maces and a half. The market outlook was promising. Taikoo Sugar B mark was priced at 16 taels and 2 maces, Tianjin goods were priced at 16 taels, CW mark was priced at 15 taels and 8 maces, DY mark was priced at 15 taels and 6 maces, and H mark was priced at 16 taels and 4 maces. There were not many transactions, but the trend was very strong. Zhenxiang Firm sold 1,500 bags of Hong Kong coarse granulated white sugar, priced at 13 taels and 9 maces. Huaxin opened 700 bags of No. 20 medium granulated white sugar, priced at 13 taels and 6 maces, and 1,500 bags of raw red sugar, priced at 11 taels and 6 maces. Traders had strong demand, so the market outlook was firm and promising.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Tung Oil During the Plum Rain Season</h3>
<p>Hongjiang tung oil could have developed its sales field after the start of summer, but recently, due to the arrival of the plum rain season, with continuous overcast and rainy weather, and farmers are engaged in field work, the paint work has to be temporarily put on hold, and the sales path is inevitably slightly sluggish. Although the sales are clear, this has been the case in previous years, so there is nothing to worry about. Local firms are preparing for the supply after the plum rain season when the sales are slightly slower, so purchases are not deserted, and goods arrive every day, and the inventory seems to be sufficient. The selling price is 17 taels and 8 maces for Chenyuan Feng as the regular market price, and Xiangtai Feng, Jifeng, and Yingfeng all sell for 17 taels.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Amidst Frequent Price Drops in Yarn</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market of this factory has seen an unprecedentedly severe decline in recent days, due to the sharp fall in American cotton and the resulting nervousness. Traders from the Yangtze River region have found it difficult to be active, and the financial community is still exercising caution, making it difficult to make progress for the time being. Moreover, the inventory of each factory is increasing day by day, and Japanese goods are also active, creating this situation. Yesterday, 16-pound coarse cloth was priced at 7 taels, Kuixing was priced at 7 taels and 5 cents, and 13-pound Flying Bear and Person Top Ball were priced down to 5 taels and 1 mace. 11-pound cloth was priced at 4 taels and 3 maces and a half, and 9-pound cloth had already fallen below the 4 tael mark. Fine cloth was priced below 7 taels, Balloon Red Peacock was priced at 6 taels and 5 maces, Jincheng was priced at 6 taels and 8 maces, and fine twill Changzhou goods were priced at 6 taels 1-2 maces. Coarse twill from this street had slight movement, all of which were sales of dyed blank cloth. Mao Ying was priced at 4 taels 7 maces and a half, Three Rabbit was priced at 4 taels 8 maces and a half, Three Fish was priced at 4 taels 9 maces, and Person Tower was priced at 6 taels 7 maces and a half.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Iron Market Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have seen few sales due to the plum rain season, so the standard has not progressed much. However, the recent trend of buying and selling by traders from the northern region seems to be promising. For example, negotiations for new iron goods opened for a large amount of over 1,000 dan yesterday, and the market was better than before. The opening prices for new plate, triangle iron, new foreign plate, and new foreign square were all 5 cents to 1 mace better than the previous market. However, the association is concerned about the high cost of these goods and the scarcity of sources, so there have been proposals to continue to raise prices. Customers and users have heard this news, and their buying interest has increased, so the future of the market is very promising.</p>

<h3>Explanation of Civil War</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>The term civil war was originally not found in the classics, but since the Republic of China, domestic wars have been staged frequently, acting out the "reading the wall" good show. The term civil war has become a very fashionable specialized term.</p>
<p>The Chinese people's consciousness is shallow, thinking that fighting between Chinese people is a civil war. Today, I finally know that this is completely wrong. Where did this come from? I have newspapers as evidence. According to a Hong Kong telegram in a certain newspaper yesterday, "The Political Committee will issue a circular telegram, explaining that sending troops to attack Hainan is to punish those who resist orders and is different from civil war." According to this, is our explanation of the term civil war completely wrong? Because there are many names for both sides in the frequent civil wars, those with names cannot be regarded as civil wars.</p>
<p>Since our country has no civil war, where did the term civil war come from? How can it be considered a civil war? Oh! It's probably wrong. The September 18th Incident can be considered a civil war, and the January 28th Incident can also be considered a civil war, because foreigners fighting in our inland is a civil war. If Chinese people fight with Chinese people, this is called punishing those who resist orders, not a civil war. The explanation of civil war may be like this.</p>

<h3>New Wireless Radio</h3>
<p>— Nai Zheng</p>
<p>The rapid progress of wireless radio is unmatched by other sciences. Recently, it has reached a stage of sudden advancement. The progress in these few years is faster than in the previous few years. We can still remember that three or five years ago, ordinary people would buy a crystal radio to listen to music, reports, records, etc., but at first, they had to climb to the roof to put up an antenna, dig dirty soil, or clean water pipes to ground the wire. After connecting it well, they had to carefully touch the ore. After putting on the earphones and hearing a sound like a mosquito flapping its wings, they would be overjoyed. However, after wearing it for a long time, they would get a headache and their faces would turn red, and only one person could listen. Although there was another kind that used a triode tube to connect to a loudspeaker so that many people could listen, they had to take a dozens of pounds heavy battery to the electrical appliance store to charge it, carrying it back and forth, and then they had to buy another battery, which was very inconvenient. Later, a kind of battery was invented that did not need A and B batteries. It only used alternating current, that is, the electricity we usually use for lights. We only need to plug it into the "outlet" to use it, which is very convenient. This is the new wireless radio. Not only does it have this convenience, but it has also been significantly improved this year, increasing the accuracy of the sound and making it very similar to the original sound. The sound is clear and there is no other noise. It is also beautiful and magnificent, easy to adjust, easy to open and close, and precise to select, all of which are sufficient to show special progress. Now I will briefly talk about it from the outside to the inside.</p>
<p>New radios are all installed in boxes. The material of the boxes is wood or metal, and the surface is painted with various colors of paint. Some are painted like wood grain, some are like the color of peach wood, beautiful and smooth, and very lovely. Its shape is like that of a grandfather clock, or like an expensive low cabinet, or other various styles. The latest type of radio, even the inexpensive one, can receive broadcasts from this city without using an antenna or grounding wire, so there are no messy wires coming in and out. It only has one wire coming out to allow alternating current to enter. After years of progress, its management has a certain standard. The current standard management has a small electric key to turn on (On) and off (Off) it. Because after the outgoing wire is plugged into the "outlet," the current does not flow into the vacuum tube. The current only flows when this small electric key is turned on. In ordinary radios, another small light bulb inside lights up, and the light透透comes out from the translucent mica scale plate. It tells you that the electricity inside is flowing, and you can then use your hand to turn the selection knob. The selection knob is specifically used to select the radio station (Station Selection). Because the wavelengths of each radio station are different, you can rotate it arbitrarily to select the station. Usually, it is attached with a graduated circular piece, and the knob rotates and the circular piece also rotates. If we want to listen to XWCL radio broadcasts, we chose it tonight, and the clearest indication is at what degree, then we can rotate it to this degree tomorrow night to hear its sound, provided that its wavelength does not change. The selection knob is usually in the middle of the other two knobs and is a little larger than the two knobs on the sides. We must also rotate a volume control knob to make the volume as loud or soft as we want. However, in the past, the sound of radios was often not like the original sound after it was amplified. Even if the original sound was lively and emotional singing, it seemed to turn into a strange crying sound after being amplified by the radio. The Suzhou dialect storytelling seemed to turn into the tone of an old man singing Peking opera on the stage, which was very unpleasant. However, the latest type of radio has been improved. It has a tone adjustment knob (Tone Control) that makes the amplified sound lifelike and can be completely like the real thing, vivid and full of life. There are also carved hollow patterns with silk or velvet cloth lining inside, and the sound comes out from here. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Little Technician</h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>Although human beings are the spirit of all things, they are ultimately just animals that live for life.</p>
<p>Whether they are high-ranking officials, comprador classes, or even beggars and thieves, although there is a distinction between wisdom and foolishness in knowledge, they all seek to survive. Perhaps sometimes the desire for wealth will surpass everything, but the lowest limit for human beings is to seek survival. In other words, it is nothing more than seeking a comfortable life.</p>
<p>On Sunday, my old friend Kuang Xiaoan came to see me. After chatting for a while, because of boredom and loneliness, he intentionally or unintentionally invited him to the City God Temple to drink tea.</p>
<p>Speaking of drinking tea, I thought of the living habits of the Chinese society. A part of the bored people spend most of their time in tea houses.</p>
<p>When we stepped into the Deyi Building, the upper and lower floors had already declared "full." We finally found a seat on the third floor. The tea servant brewed the tea, and then a series of beggars came to ask for money. Naturally, these people are pitiful and annoying, but thinking about the entire social problem, I couldn't help but feel deeply moved.</p>
<p>After a while, a seven-year-old child came to the tea house. He had a thin face and two round little eyes, constantly estimating the tea drinkers. He was barefoot, revealing dirty skin. After looking around, he started performing his skills on the spot.</p>
<p>He can practice boxing, he can also do somersaults, he can stand upside down on his feet, and grab the ground with his hands. After he performed like this, he stood up and bowed to each tea drinker, and then collected a copper coin from them as usual. Naturally, I could not avoid this obligation either.</p>
<p>"This is a little technician," I said with a smile to Kuang.</p>
<p>"Yes, but it's too pitiful," Kuang said with emotion. "Foreigners learn some small tricks and are called technicians. Chinese children know this set of tricks, but they have to beg for money."</p>
<p>"Begging for money is also a skill. Otherwise, those good people may not be willing to easily give away a copper coin."</p>
<p>Kuang was silent, and I couldn't say anything more. In the time of the setting sun, we left the tea house and walked home separately. Looking up at the evening glow in the sky, it was red like blood.</p>

<h3>The Big Menu</h3>
<p>— Guang</p>
<p>Although the rules of S School in Shanghai South are lenient, students who are absent from class must eat a big menu. Perhaps it is to show the principal's generosity. In the past, the principal's car was so majestic, but in recent years, the car has disappeared, and a chartered car has replaced the previous car.</p>
<p>The school's treatment of students remains the same. The big menu can often be seen in the display area, and it is always "don't invite, but if you invite, invite dozens." However, the resourceful students said when they saw the big menu, "Let him invite guests, and I will choose not to go." This wonderful method spread from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred, and almost the entire school followed suit. This infallible method can avoid eating a big menu, so the principal has no way to think. Later, he suddenly came up with a wonderful plan: "The general menu is posted in the display area, and then there is a personal invitation list. Come to the classroom during class to invite." This wonderful plan was implemented, and the resourceful students had no choice but to taste the big menu.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is that one day, five minutes after the geometry class started, an uninvited guest suddenly came and took out a big menu. Teacher × read, "××× is invited to the Training Office to talk." ××× frowned and left. Half an hour after the class started, another sheet came, "××× is invited to the library." Finally, three minutes before the class ended, another sheet came, "×××××... etc., after class, go to the principal's office." The invited students had to go to eat the big menu within ten minutes after class. The teachers hated the interruption of their lectures from time to time, and the students were very dissatisfied with this policy of inviting guests, but they "only dared to be angry but did not dare to speak." The teachers held the attitude of "better to do less than to do more," so this wonderful plan of inviting guests is still being implemented continuously.</p>
<p>Reply Letter</p>
<p>Reply to a letter. After reading the newspaper two days ago, I learned that a gentleman inquired about the item Ethylene, where to buy it. He thought that Yonghuai先生 had already replied briefly in his manuscript. After checking, Ethylene is a gas at normal temperature, and it may not be easy to buy in pharmacies. There are many ways to make it. Generally, alcohol and sulfuric acid can be used. Put them in a curved-necked bottle and connect it with a glass tube. Connect the other end to another bottle. Immerse the bottle in cold water to keep the surrounding temperature below normal temperature. Alcohol and sulfuric acid are heated by fire, emitting gaseous Ethylene. After passing through the glass tube into the low-temperature bottle, it will be converted into liquid Ethylene. It can be quickly sprayed on vegetable leaves. The vegetables and fruits themselves contain moisture, and their temperature is lower than normal temperature. Ethylene can make vegetables and fruits ripen early because its temperature gradually increases when it returns to gas in the air. Within 48 hours, it is nourished in the air with the moisture in the vegetables and fruits, so the vegetables and fruits can mature early. Clear reply.</p>
