<h3>小國與日本正面衝突</h3>
<p>提出申斥戎首决議草案</p>
<p>日代表以退盟恫嚇要求撤回</p>
<p>大小國繼續發表對滿案意見</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨十時三刻國聯續開大會、愛爾蘭·西班牙·捷克·瑞典四國代表提出草案請聯盟否認九　八事件爲日本自衛行動聲明「滿洲國」之産生、爲日軍在塲之結果、故若予承認、勢將違反國際間的義務　最後並建議請美俄兩國加入丨九國委員會共討論、松岡對該草案表示反對、要求將該案撤銷、加拿大對日本意見、表示贊同、（八日中央社電）　　（日内瓦）聞四國提案之簽字國主張依瑞士與捷克兩國名義提出之議案、先行辦理、以免載有不承認「滿洲國」條文之議案投票表决、此案僅將連同關於此爭點之各方面演說詞及其他文件、彙交調解委員會考慮、查瑞士與捷克兩國名義提出之議案專言特别委員會事、（八日路透社電）　　（日内瓦）今日午後開會以前、大會議塲及旁聽席中頗有緊張氣象、各代表相緊立談日本對於四國提案之態度、小國又開一度會議、但聞不願撤回其議案、傳說日代表將不以此案僅僅提交十九特委會爲滿意、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日上午國聯開會後、宣讀西班牙愛爾蘭捷克瑞典四國提出議案之後日代表松岡鑒於形勢不佳、即出其最後手段、第一次當衆作退出國聯恫嚇、堅稱此案不符國聯原則及李頓報告、要求立即撤回、否則渠將請主席立即付表决、如提案通過、渠恐將有提案人所不及料之後果云、會衆聞之、如晴天之霹靂、提案人立即退出會塲、作私人之商確、日代表所言、顯然含有如此案通過、日本將退出國聯之意、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）西班牙愛爾蘭瑞典捷克四國曾在大會提出决議案、致引起日代表之抗議該四國代表當於大會散會以後開會討論據聞必欲維持草案原文、因此該草案將在大會投票表、决若經三分二之多數通過、即將提交十九國委員會、但該草案能否獲得此項多數、據大會休息室内各方意見、殊爲懷疑、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>郭泰祺之演說</h3>
<p>任何解决方案</p>
<p>必須以盟約爲基礎</p>
<p>東省處現狀下</p>
<p>直接交涉斷不可能</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日下午我國代表郭泰祺在國聯大會演說、謂任何解决方案、必須以盟約及中國主權完整爲基礎、現狀之下直接交涉斷不可能、（八日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國代表郭泰祺今日在國聯大會演說、宣稱中國接受英外相西門提議先交十九國委員會草擬解决滿案辦法、幷邀美俄加入、然後將所擬辦　提交大會通過　謂中政府贊同英國提議、因其根據於李頓報告第九章並受該章之管理故、郭氏又力請大會通過一决議案禁止承認滿洲僞組織、及贊成抵制日貨爲中國人民抗抵日本在滿侵略之舉動、謂對此間題、西門演說未合中國意見云、（八日國民社電）</p>
<h3>政府致代表團訓電</h3>
<p>請十九國會迅謀解决</p>
<p>（南京）外交界息、國聯大會日内閉幕、全案送十九國委員會討論解决辦法、此次會議小國代表頗主持正義、但大國代表過於持重、實質上未有顯著進展、聞政府方面已訓令我代表團、請十九國委員會於接受全案後應迅謀適當之解决云（八日中央社電）</p>
<h3>四國決議草案</h3>
<p>不承認日本卵翼下之僞國主張邀美俄參加恊議調解第一提案爲捷克愛爾蘭西班牙　瑞典提出者、原文如下、</p>
<p>本大會鑒於李頓調查團之結論、内稱、一九三一年九月十八日以前和平解决之各種可能方法、未曾採用　又稱、中日間之關係、乃變相戰爭之之關係、並稱、一九三一年九月十八日以後、日軍之軍事行動、有能認爲合法自衛</p>
<p>本大會鑒於李頓調查團之報告内稱未經宣戰、而中國土地一部分已被日軍奪據、並宣告與中國他處脫離關係而獨立、</p>
<p>本大會又鑒於李頓調查團之結論、内稱、滿洲現有制度、不能認爲誠摯的與自然的獨立運動、</p>
<p>故本大會認一九三一年九月十八日事變後大規模之軍事佔據、不能視爲合法自衛之計畫、</p>
<p>本大會並認滿洲境内現所成立之制度、僅恃日軍之在境得以實施、又認對於滿洲現有制度之承認、實不適合現有之國際義務、</p>
<p>本大會現授權十九特委會與美俄兩國政府合作、以便與兩造　洽、俾覓取根據上述結論解决此項爭執之辦法、</p>
<h3>第二提案係以瑞士與捷克兩國名義</h3>
<p>提出者、原文如下、</p>
<p>本大會接有李頓調查團之報告與兩造意見書、及行政院自本年十一月二十一日至十一月二十八日之會議紀錄、並鑒於本大會之討論、現請根據一九三二年三月十一日大會决議案舉派之特别委員會（十九特委會）</p>
<p>㈠研究本大會討論中所表示之意見、及提出之建議、幷研究提交本大會之草議案、</p>
<p>㈡草議提案、以期解决根據一九三二年二月十九日行政院决議案提出之爭執、</p>
<p>㈢以此項提案、在可能的最短時間内提交本大會、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>日代表團之宣言</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會日本代表團正式發言人伊藤向報界發表宣言如下、一吾人對於西班牙捷克愛爾蘭瑞典四國代表所提出之决議草案、甚爲詫異、就余之見解而論、此項决議草案、實以辱駡日本爲唯一目的、日本今方努力說明其所處地位、英法及其大小各國代表今方建議調解、該决議草案乃竟在此際提出於大會、至少當認爲不公平、日本代表團深信已接近調解之途徑、而該决議草案　屬背道而馳、非常大會大部份代表、衆經先後發表演說、側重調解、今其中四代表突然有該决議草案之提出、且得全會場或全會場廣大之贊助、吾人於此不得不置疑於發表意見諸人是否有誠意云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美俄參加問題</h3>
<p>西門與兩國代表密商</p>
<p>職權與範圍未規定前</p>
<p>日政府暫不表示態度</p>
<p>（日内瓦）英外長西昨日在大會演說前、與美俄兩代表秘密接洽、據稱兩代表均對西門答復、若國聯大會議决開二十一國會議、邀請兩國參加、兩國决不退辭、（八日華聯社電）　　（日内瓦）聞英外相西門先獲有一種保障、邀請美俄參加十九特委會一舉、不致爲人所不歡迎、故西門始正式提議邀請、此事須俟大會票决後、始可進行、届時大會主席將正式向雙方接洽（八日路透電）　　（東京）此間對於英外相西門爵十主張以美俄兩國加入調解委員會、頗表冷淡、政府方面亦尙無具體表示、今晚日政府之發言人稱、在美京俄京兩方面對此問題未表明態度、及調解委員之職權與範圍未决定以前、日政府對於此事將暫時不置可否云、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）英外相西門在七日國聯大會提議組織二十一國委員會、以調解中日問題、而大會形勢向此目的推之空氣頗爲濃厚、日外務省接到此　、八日晨召集某關係人開會恊議對策、結果决定方針、非先確知該委員會之任　務權限及其範圍等、不能表示贊否、且如抵觸如次三項原則日本絕對反對其組織㈠組織解决滿洲問題之委員會、以當事國代表之參加爲絕對必要、日本排除第三國干涉本問題、㈡滿洲問題應由理事會審議、移交調解委員會乃違反國聯本來之使命㈢解决滿洲問題、以日本承認「滿洲國」之事實爲必要條物件、（八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日政府對於調解委員會之意見、以爲若不抵觸承認「滿洲國」之旣定方針、則不加反對、惟對該會之構成其意如下、㈠二十一國委員會若無中日兩國、則其外觀如强制裁判之機關、有背國聯盟約之協調精神㈠者若美俄兩國參加該會、則現實之「滿洲國」亦應加、入或將要求中日「滿」三國參加該會云、（八日電通社電）美國準備</p>
<h3>與國聯會合作</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）華盛頓聞四小國已在日内瓦提出邀請美國蘇俄參加十九國委員會議案後、頓起深切注意聞政府要人今日對於一旦接到邀請後美國應取之途徑、曾在國務院會商頗久、據目前表示、設國聯能先後受李頓報告、然後邀請、則將更易於美國所接受、因美國認李頓報告爲純粹國聯事也、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>英外相西門之演說</p>
<h3>對中日案認識不足</h3>
<p>圖爲國聯脫卸責任</p>
<p>促進中日直接交涉</p>
<p>特别指出報告書中扺貨一章</p>
<p>隱示中國應負事變遠因責任</p>
<p>西門於七日下午在大會中發言、謂李頓報告書所買獻最大役務之一、爲滿洲難題複雜性質之揭開、此非一國已先試行國聯盟約所規定各種調解機會而無成效、然後始對另　國宣戰之案件亦非一國以兵力侵犯鄒國邊界簡單案件、蓋滿洲問題中有許多特點、非世界他處所可比擬也李頓報告書不作一方面之陳述、但對於中日兩國皆發適得其當之批評、如李頓報告書不載有滿洲境内可怖的狀况之插寫、及排貨運動之客觀的紀錄、則報告書之内容不能謂爲公允、</p>
<h3>不欲做裁判員捷克外長先獲吾心</h3>
<p>捷克代表皮尼士曾謂渠不願爲任何</p>
<p>一方之裁判員　此言實獲吾心、除特殊事件外、有一要事須注意者、即國聯方法未被運用是也、吾人爲國聯會員、故吾人之責任、</p>
<h3>恢復東省原狀英代表謂爲不可能</h3>
<p>在保障國聯盟、約而使國聯方法儘可能範圍運用在將來、吾人首先關切者、爲國聯能運用以改良現有時局之勢力、及國聯不能用此勢力、以致影響將來之嚴重後果、中日間現有衝突、旣因去年九月以前狀况而起、今欲恢復原狀　實招致禍亂之復作、此徒從理想着手、而置時局中之實有事物於不願也、</p>
<h3>解决中日爭執應重實際不重理想</h3>
<p>是以吾人當注重實、際雙方皆未完全接受此報告書、雙方皆各有所退讓、吾人除根據報告書第一部分所載之　史與事實、及其結論進行外、别無他法、吾人必須　護國聯原則、而提倡和解、如直接談判、有良好結果之希望、吾人應以吾人權力内所可有之各種方法以鼓勵之、伹國聯亦可襄助此和解工作也。</p>
<h3>主張美俄參加辦事效能庶充裕</h3>
<p>如能設法使美俄代表加入十九特委會、則特委會辦理此事之效力、更可充裕、西門言至此、追述松岡對行政院之言論、内稱、、日本向爲良好忠實之國聯會員、願竭其所能以保持此種態度云、余代表始終爲國聯史實會員國發言　小國與大國間　關於此點絕無差異、</p>
<h3>認盟約即憲法寧容一國自由弁髦</h3>
<p>國聯盟約同爲吾人之憲法、吾人不能自由髦弁之、吾人責當維持之、吾人先必須覔取合於實際之解决法、如國聯辦理愼重適當提倡解决、則可大有裨補、英國願會同其他會員國、連中日在内、竭其能力予以合作、以覔取與各方面利益皆公允適合之解决方法、而終止目前衝突、並銷除將來衝突之可能性、</p>
<h3>援引林肯名言以努力和平相勗勉</h3>
<p>西門最後證引林肯在第二次國會開幕之演詞一節以結束其今晨之言論、林肯之言、曰「不對人懷有惡意、對於全體保持善會虔信正義、如上帝使吾人見到者、吾人其勉力以完成吾人現有之工作、以成就可在吾人與世界各國間植立公正的永久的和平之事實」（七日路透電）（日内瓦）七日各大國代表發言、英國代表言論頗有袒白傾向、凡李頓報告書對我不利之點、如抵貨排外等均予申述、對日不利之點則概不提及、尤可注意者、英代表引李頓報告書之言、謂　恢復九　八以前狀態爲不可能、」而對於李頓所稱維持現僞國亦屬不合之句、竟不採及、此間一般論調、莫不深爲駭異、（八日中央電）</p>
<h3>英報之評論</h3>
<p>（倫敦）每日電聞批評日内瓦關於中日問題之辯論、希望英外相西門所提出將此問題解决工作交與十九特委會、而邀美俄代表參加之建議、當可爲日内瓦各方面及美俄政府所贊成、（八日路透電）　　（倫敦）今日泰晤七報批評外相西門昨在日内瓦國聯大會所發之演詞、謂此乃對於辛辣言論之有益的調和物、日本未先商諸國聯遽在滿洲行動　今即聞國聯有不客氣之議論、當亦不以爲意、李頓報告書表明如任何一方面不再以强暴行爲增重時局　則必以調和覓取解决、今此問題移交一九特委會辦理、誠可斥爲延宕、但滿案爭執、確爲以忍耐爲和平解决第一條件之問題、「滿洲國」成立之宣布、阻碍李頓報告書所載政策之立即實施、但一年前日本所準備接受者、在一二年後、日本或再將準備接受之、日本國内目前國家主義與　武主義之情感、終必有反動之　日、國聯之工作、在以滿洲居民之永遠利益調和、新邦所代表的言過其實之獨立運動、今欲希望國家作戲劇的姿勢、實爲無益、蓋國聯所建議之極好政策、端賴各個國之志願以實行之也云云、（八日路透電）德外長演說</p>
<h3>弦外有音涉及軍平等</h3>
<p>德代表牛賴資發言稱、中日衝突、與德國有特殊關係、因德國乃解除軍備之國家、在其與國聯工作中、對於可防止利用武力、及提倡和平解决之制度、尤予以特殊之重視也、中日衝突乃此種理論之徵寳、蓋過去一年之經騐、巳向全世界揭示有極大困難、即軍事手段在衝突中一日實現則國聯命令莫可執行是、德代表切言中日衝突之特别性質、謂政治上經濟上社會上利益之衝突、已在滿洲發生一種爭端、而非支配兩造關係之複雜協定所能支持、是以國聯有應以抽象的原則處理此事爲限、但必須成立一種建設計畫、旣可謀取有效之解决　又可防止將來衝突之復作、國聯必須顧及民族之必要力量及其發展之天然趨向、决不可始終忽視過去十年中滿洲境内所發現之天然進化　同時國聯必須沿和平途徑、指導此種發展、庶使武力之施用得以切實廢除、此非創立新司法制度謂、但僅謂有關係之各國政府應集合於國聯盟約及非戰公約原則之下耳、國聯各會員國皆有同樣關係欲中日間良好邦交之成立、德代表最後間接涉及德國在日内瓦要求地位平等事謂中日衝突之外尙有一與全世界有關係之問題此事不將在大會討論之乃中日衝突之研究、當然使大會不得不顧慮一般事件、易言之、如大會欲得一種公平之解决、而無武力干涉、則必使各國有均等兵力此種條件實關重要苟無之、則一切司法手續終成疑案云、</p>
<h3>意代表演說側重實際</h3>
<p>遠東和平基於國際間合作</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯大會中之西門演說</h3>
<p>國聯之無能力以判斷中日問題之是非。我國人早已知之。　今日猶　放棄其依賴國聯之念者。則以前數次開會。各大國間尙有　義執言之代表。在會場上發表不少正論。難未獲到滿美解决之結果。而我國人之憤氣。未嘗不因之梢平。今次之國聯開會則形勢愈非。除各小國代表。尙能支撑公道正義。一致拒絕僞滿洲之承認。而英法意德四大國。則大都主張促成中日和解。未肯明白判斷其是非。其尤足令我人不能釋然者。爲七日下午會議時西門爵士所發表之演說。</p>
<p>其第點曰。「滿洲問題。非一國以兵力侵犯鄰國之簡單案件可比。以其中有許多特點也。」然以我人觀之。此次中日交涉實爲某一國興兵以武力侵略另一國之單純案件。毫無疑義。九一八事　無論何人。皆知爲抱肆行侵略野心之日本所造成證據確鑿。即國聯之椰頓報吿亦承認之。至其中所有種種糾紛。亦皆爲日本欲逹其侵略滿洲之目的所醞釀而成西門爵士之所謂特點。在我人視之。則無一不可歸納於日人侵略行爲之結果。此則我人所深爲不解者也。</p>
<p>第二點曰「此次中日衝突。旣因去年九月以前狀况而起。則今欲恢復原狀。實足招致禍亂之再作。此蓋因徒從理想方面着手。而置時局中之實有事物於不顧也。故吾人應當注重事實。」此言更足令人駭異。試問九一八以前之安全狀况。因何而破壞乎。日人欲併呑我東北三省。故先以種種方法挑起地方上之不安。繼復以武力實行强佔其土地。是則原有狀况之破壞。日人破壞之也。則今日欲解决此問題自惟有先令日本撤兵。以恢復原有狀况爲第一義。若因恢復原狀之後。恐其再釀禍端是承認日本之武力可畏。非國聯所能遏制之也。國聯之體面。非已］剥削盡凈乎此後主張和平之弱國能不爲之寒心乎。</p>
<p>第三點曰。「如直接談判有良好之希望。我人應盡我權力内所有各方法以鼓勵之」此則不啻贊助日本之主張矣。更不啻表示國聯無力解决而推此案於門外矣。日本屢昌言中日問題不許第三者干涉不許國際聯盟置議一方面更以種種說詞。引誘我直接交涉是直接交涉。正彼夢寐以求而未償之素顧彼所以引誘我直接交涉者。以尙畏聯之能主張正義公道與遵守各種公約盟約也。我國之所以信賴國聯。亦以國聯之或尙能主張公道正義與遵守公約盟約也。今若推諉不問。而助成日人所求之不得之直接交涉。則我人又何必請求於國聯仰賴於國聯乎。</p>
<p>英國爲發起組織國聯之一分子。竭誠擁護盟約之宣。言今猶在耳。中英邦交。又稱輯睦。自當主持公平。而不稍爲左右袒。此非爲顧全邦交之私　。實亦維持國聯尊嚴所應爾。倘若一味徇强權之意。則一切公約盟約。眞將等於廢紙西門爵士之演說。不能不認其爲認識之不足。而令我人憶念前代表薛西爾之能差强人意希望英政府當局。爲世界和平計。有以糾正其誤焉。</p>

<p>fuf美總統預算報告軍政經費削减甚巨</p>
<h3>國庫短絀無法減稅財長報告財政基礎鞏固</h3>
<p>▲國民社七日華盛頓電美總統預算報告、業於今日在國會官讀、估計在一九三三至一九三四年之會計年度間、維持美政府及償付一部份國債、共需納稅人負擔四十一萬萬零八百萬金元、四·二○八·○○○·○○○金元、</p>
<p>此項預算數目、比上一年度總統提出之預算報告數目、雖略見增加、而較之上一年度實際預算、已减削五萬八千萬金元、蓋上年度内所有各項追加預算、數復不貲致令政府歲入不敷歲出、而國庫遂告虧短、</p>
<h3>▲無法减稅</h3>
<p>總統滿擬將上届國會通過之賦稅、裁撤若干、但鑒於目前情形、勢已無法裁减、即歲收一萬三千七百萬金元之汽油特稅、與歲收三萬五千五百萬金元之製造品特稅、亦必須照舊征收、否則來年預算、將虧短三萬四千七百萬元、</p>
<p>各部局經費、咸見减削、僅有三數例外、略予酌增、如美國駐華按察使署經費增加六千金元、以免國内採用之行政人員假施行於國外、</p>
<p>預算中最大支出、爲退伍軍人機關經費、共列九三一·七二七·○○○金元、但上年度則列一　·○七二·○六四·○○○金元、</p>
<h3>▲軍費大削</h3>
<p>海軍、經費列三○八·○○○·○○○·金元、上年度爲三四三·○○○·○○○·金元陸軍部列三六五·○○○·○○○金元上年度爲四二三·九四○·三○金元、此數係連巴拿馬運河地帶政費在内、若專用於軍事者、僅二七六·八六三·○○○金元、參謀總長所建議增兵經費、未曾列入、蓋其計劃、本將擬財政稍裕後實行也、海軍部經費、列三○八·○○○·○○○金元、上年度爲三四三·○○·○○○○金元、　所以外間有人認爲海軍輕費、减削過巨、因其中尙含有繼續業已開造諸艦工程之費五三·○○○·○○○金元、此外尙擬於一九三四年一月開造一萬噸新巡洋艦一艘、稍後開造驅逐艦四艘、　　此外農部一七五·六七一·○○○金元、財政部二五○·三○八·○○○金元、美京公共工程建築費四·○二五·九三三金元、</p>
<p>至本年度各部實支經費、此時尙無從精確算出、故此項預算、祇能與上一年度預算比較、惟鑒於目下稅收歉短、一般人預料、來年度預算、雖已大見核减、恐仍須有增抽新稅之必要云、</p>
<h3>德國修改憲法</h3>
<p>大理院長兼副總統</p>
<p>業經國會二讀通過</p>
<p>▲國民社七日柏林電今日德國國會中發生毆鬥之事、原因係由於共産黨議員、攻繫興登堡總統、適有一婦人、聞而大憤、起與高聲抗辯時、聽衆以該婦人爲多事、亦起與婦人爲難、此時國家社會黨之制服黨員、即起而自任糾察之責、共産黨徒、見此亦起而阻止國社黨黨員之行動、雙方毆鬥之事、即由之而發生一時桌·椅·墨水瓶·電話器具等、四處横飛、於是副議長立即宣告休會半小時後、重新舉行會議、形勢始見緩和云今國會通過最重要之議案、即爲大理院院長、同時兼任全國副總統之職、凡總統死亡、或不能履行其職務時、由副總統代理總統之職、此議案提出後、國政黨及其産黨均極反對、國社黨之理由、謂大理院爲獨立司法機關、不願應兼任行政長官之事、致有損司法之獨立、而將大理院院長牽入政治漩　云、惟該議案卒能通過二讀、而三讀約須在明日舉行、此案爲變更憲法、故需議員三分之二之多數贊成、始能最後通過、又敎士中央黨·國社黨·社會民主黨、曾提出許多動議、主張廢止近今所宣布緊急命令中之條文若干、如工資定率、疾病保險及其他救濟問題之類、大約將於星期五日繼續討論之、此外國社黨·共産黨·社會民主黨、尙提出大赦政治犯案、已移交特别委員會審查、各黨關於該問題之意見、僅小有了出入、故不致發生困難、預料諸案辦竣後、國會或將無期延會至何時再行召集、將由議長或常務委員會主裁、</p>
<h3>大閙德國會</h3>
<p>▲國社黨與共産黨議員　大打出手</p>
<p>▲茶盤電話痰盂墨水瓶　空中飛舞</p>
<p>▲路透社七日柏電今日午後國會開會時、國家社會黨與共産黨議員、因共産黨某議員痛詆興登堡總統、而起惡鬥茶盤·電話·灰碟·痰盂·墨水瓶·飛舞空中、其狀可怖、旁聽者中有人加入爲衣制服之國社黨員所執、於是共産黨員五十人一擁登樓、復在樓上互毆、議員數人爲器皿之碎片所傷、未幾、怒氣平息、恢復秩序、乃開始辯論、國社黨所提出總統如有意外或辭職、則應由大理院長代握總統職權議案、該議案志在防杜大權落於施萊轍總理之手</p>
<h3>▲財政鞏固</h3>
<p>▲國民社七日華盛電今日隨總統預算報告送至國會之財政部長米爾士報告、稱美國財政、雖以近兩年繼續虧短、基礎仍屬鞏固、至稅收之短絀、則係隨私人工商業收入同時減少所以各項政費、必須力加樽節、</p>
<p>至國庫短絀、估計至本會計年度終了時、將達一·一四六·○○○·○○○金元、規定還債之欵尙不在内、所以在今後一兩年内、勢將無法減少國債總統預算報告中雖列入還債之欵、恐將仍被移作臨時支出也、</p>
<h3>▲稅收不旺</h3>
<p>年來稅收非常歉短、當一九三二年會計年度終了時、其稅收總數、僅及一九三○年度爲止之前四年間平均稅收之半、即本會計年度稅收、至年度終了時、恐將比今年五月一日估計者一減少二六四·○○○○○○金元反之、政府支出、則因救濟計劃之日多、反有增無已、以故國庫有此鉅額虧短、又謂渠因此竭力反對國會再有任何增加預算之新計劃、</p>
<p>▲國民社七日華盛頓電美總統預算及政務報告、旣已送達國會、今日參衆兩院、乃開始着手十大預算法案、準備討論表决、現料　次國會旣屬硝期會議、而三閱月後、又須改換政府、諒將不致再事黨派爭執、可望迅速通過各案、</p>
<h3>日本空前的財政破綻</h3>
<p>匯兌低落···············外債增加</p>
<p>日政府亦認爲將來之大難題</p>
<p>日本通訊、日本自從實行發揮其侵略政策之後、總算是盛極一時、獨霸東亞了、然而他爲什麽舉國上下、自當權的軍部起以至於出汗　工資生活的人、都一致高呌國難當頭呢、日本之所謂國難又在那裏呢、是左傾思想的發展嗎、是軍事力量的不充實嗎、是世界經濟恐慌所給予的影響、使他商品生産過剩、釀成國内的經濟恐慌嗎、是農村　於破産不可救治嗎、這些問題、雖然都是日本當前的難題、是日本的死活關係、如果不一齊凑起來、還是算不香致命傷痕、幷且是隱埋在社會底下不十分看香淸楚的、特别是他感覺遲鈍頭腦比較單純的軍事當局、更加對這些問題漠視、他們所看見的、第一是「滿洲問題」、日本雖然是吞下去、到底是不是像前外長幣原喜重郎所說的眞是「一顆炸彈」、不久會在日本帝國肚　爆發、第二是美國旣與日本對立、不可調和、蘇聯也幷非日本的與國根本上和日冰炭不相容、他們日夜思維如何控制美國金圓勢力的東漸、如何阻止「赤化」的侵入滿洲、但又不能不緩和蘇聯的情感、使他不爲日本第一個敵人、他們對於這些都籌備得很週密、特别是對盤據呼倫貝爾一帶的蘇炳文張殿九、籌備得有極毒辣的圈套、恐怕蘇張兩軍很難於和日本相持、殊不知極困難的問題、不在軍事、不在外交反而在日本自已的財政、</p>
<p>從去年秋季以後、日本的産業界衰頽日甚、市而敗落、已由内而外、使社會根本上發生動搖、起初他的黨局（若　内閣和軍部）以爲一旦發動對外的軍事行動、旣取得地盤、又剌激起國民的熱感、則區區財政困難、當可掩飾過去、無如事實不樣簡單、匪特軍費花出去一下子收不回來、即市面也因此弄得更壞、於是犬養組閣之初、就實行禁止「金輸出」換一句話說、是要採用通貨膨脹政策不過日本國内的金融資本家、而有多少近代知識的人、不主張輕意放任、致陷財政於破局然而這還不能救濟他的困難、他所希望的市面繁榮、絲毫也沒有改善、到了今年五六月間、生絲市價大跌、産業界幾科乎快要整個的破産、於是纔利用美國大選的煽動市面、實行通貨膨脹主義、生絲這纔漲價一倍有奇、所以政　會一部分、竟主張减低貨幣價値一至日金百圓値美金二十五圓、、以挽濟日本的經濟頽運、</p>
<p>這政策雖然當時有人反對、不曾實行、可是通貨膨脹額、却在八千萬日金以上、同時其國内所存現金、亦减低到億二千萬日金、因此對外匯兌、更見低落、最近乃打破歷來所未有的新紀録、日金百元不過値美金二十元又八分之一、幷且還要向下跌、就一方面看、固然足以剌激日本貨品的向外輸出、可是在另一方面、却反而令日本的輸入美棉印棉、感受莫大的威脅、這或者可以互相抵消的一件買賣、最困難的是日本所負的外債、原來票面記明是美金英磅或法郎的、照現時的匯兌率計算、要增加負債額一倍半、</p>
<p>據日本銀行的調查、本年十月底日本所負外債總額如次、（單位日金千元以平價計算）</p>
<p>國債　　　　一、三九八、二九七　　地方債　　　　　二三四、三九○　　銀行債　　　　　　一九　一七七　　公司負債　　　　四五九、三二三　　總計　　　　二一、一一一、八七以上總計有値二十一億日金的外債、而對法的債務、因爲大多數在歐戰時都已轉入日人手中、故未記入、這些債劵、差不多有五億日金的在日人手中、幷已向日本銀行登記過還有五億日金的債劵、</p>
<p>雖在日人手中、却未登記、去年禁止金輸出之前、三井三菱曾做過一大筆投機生意、買進美金、無形中賺了上千萬的錢、現在對外匯兌、更加低落、凡是有錢的資本家、都焦慮日本金價的將來、資本總是要往安全地方走、他們的金錢、都將逃到海外去、則日本更加困窮、不用講産業界會陷於停滯、日幣將愈不値錢、而資金逃往外國之後、單說這二十一億餘日金的外債、將如何償還、</p>
<p>現在日本政府、看見了這種將來的大難題、於是由財長主張强制收買日本人手裏的外國貨幣的債劵、甚至於要管理對外貿易（效法革命後的俄國）不過收買日本人手裏的外債、須得設立外國貨幣評價委員會到底依照發券當時的價格呢、照禁止金輸出以前的價格呢或另用適當的折算價格呢、還是照時價呢現在都還不曾决定而收買的無論是政府是地方是銀行是發債券的公司本身現在姑不置論、所困難的是這筆十億以上的巨欵、同時還有十億以上在外國人手裏、這都是他莫可如何的事、且不講還本、就是說付利也足以使日本財政陷於破局</p>

<h3>皖省米照捐取消</h3>

<h3>鐵道部說明眞如聯運站計畫</h3>
<p>謂所圈地面積</p>
<p>實已無可再減</p>
<p>鐵道部决定在上海中山路與交通路交叉點迤西、建築京滬滬杭甬兩路聯運站、所估地面、在現時咱綫之南北兩方、即上海市眞如區彭浦區内也、茲簡略說明如在左、</p>
<h3>需要情形</h3>
<p>鐵路車站之位置、與市政之發展、至有關係、上海市政府、前頒上海市市中心區域計畫、擬設客運總站於市中心之西中山北路之旁、貨運總站、則沿京滬路向市郊偏僻部分移出、設於眞如附近、並以現有北站、阻碍閘北交通、主張遷讓、鐵道部詳加研究、亦認有移地建築之必要、復以北站爲三十年前之計畫、現在上海人口增加、商業興盛、較之三十年前、大相懸殊、故北站之地點設備、均不足以應付今日之需要、遑論數十年後、茲當兵燹之餘、房屋傾頽、設備損敗、與其補苴罅漏、一仍舊貫、旣難期鐵路交通之疏暢、復爲市政進行之障碍、遂毅然擇地改作、爲一勞永逸之計、</p>
<h3>設計及擇地</h3>
<p>欲求應付現在上海之需要、並足以替代北站之適中地點、聯運站以設立於上海市所指西市郊偏僻部分之便於客貨運輪之上下而距離北站相近者爲適宜、故聯運站地點之選擇及一切布置計畫、必須不外三種原則、㈠距離目前滬市中心不能太遠、㈡京滬滬杭甬兩路聯運、必須便利、不能失其聯絡、㈢將來總站必須設在江灣、聯運站之設計及地點、應顧及列車直達總站之便利、依此三種原則、故聯運站必須在京滬滬杭甬兩線交叉地點、而列車經行該站、尤應避免北站之輾轉迂迴、現在之旅客列車、固多以此爲終點、但將來江灣客運總站實行建築之後、則經過之運輸益繁、故此聯運站、依照穿越站之規模而設計、軌道佈置、多般串軌、各線均求經濟適用、月台站屋設備、務以旅客方便爲主、又爲減省調車時間起見、機車房及車房、均妥爲布置、俾列車在站卸空之後、逕前載入車房、機車經過曲線、駛入機車房方向自轉、以備回程之用、計畫旣定、遂以合於上列三種原則、而又又適宜於實用、選定現時所圈地段、</p>
<h3>占用地畝面積</h3>
<p>聯運站占用地畝、面積共二千八百畝、其中爲路基所佔者約一百五十畝、其餘爲軌道佈置及各種建築設備所必需、蓋以鐵路營業之增進、上海市將來之迅速發展、港務之興隆、均有一日千里之勢、若不早爲之圖、則不待五十年後、恐已不敷展布、復以便利旅客商家、在前述站屋軌道車房機車房之布置外、舉凡一切貨棧、各種辦公室鐵路旅館職員宿舍及其他與鐵路有關之建築等、均維列於站屋附近、俾將來之鐵路員工之工作効率得以增進、而商旅之便利、得以加多、故此聯運站之設計、並非僅爲應付目前之客貨運輸、所佔用二千八百畝之面積、實已無可再減矣、</p>
<p>極端注意、主持取消甚力、刻聞皖省府已將該省糧食照捐、由常會議决、通令一律取消、以前爲人民所詬病之米照捐、至此始决然芟除、告一段落、惟此項米照捐、向係指作建築公路基金、現旣取消、所有築路經費、聞財部擬另行設法補助、以免路工中輟、總此、可知宋部長關念民瘼、毅力熱心、而財部民食會議之効果、亦克觀厥成云、</p>

<h3>金澈案詳情</h3>
<p>新聲社云、自日探綁架歸化籍民金永鐸案發生　、中外人士、對於此案極爲注意、此之主要角色、除金澈金哲及漢奸黃展英外、背景人物、尙有多名、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>（抗日大同盟之成立）</p>
<p>金永鐸爲韓國要人、歸化中國、業已數載、與中國人多所聯絡、九一八案發生以後、有揚州人趙石龍與稽翥靑友善、因介紹稽與金等相識、時抗日團體紛立、各報宣傳、盛極一時、預趙石龍向各方奔走、組織抗日大同盟、預定方針、爲㈠不在報紙宣傳、㈡盟員務求忠義精幹、在精切做事、不在虛張聲勢、㈢經費由發起人負擔、㈣嚴守秘密、是以除向律師公會請求援救安昌浩之函件、曾登報端外、從無見有此項名稱、流傳社會、如金永鐸金哲等皆其中之人物也、然該同盟之内容、已爲黃展英盡情報告於日領、此刻無容嚴守秘密、故稽翥靑將有長文向社會報告、</p>
<p>（寒風凛烈星夜營救）</p>
<p>前月三十日夜間、金永鐸被綁後、稽翥靑得金妻崔惠淳之報告、逐向崔赴出事地點查看一切、知爲黃展英所賣、乃往尋吳凱聲律師未遇、繼見蔡曉白律師、蔡聞稽至、披衣而起、齒戰有聲、立允向法領署依法交涉、稽又往尋抗日團體中堅份子鄭某、請其協助、又往尋同盟徐某未遇、又赴法捕房探視金哲及被獲之日探、因夜深未遇祇見金哲、偃臥於門内、次農於金哲出險以後、又同蔡曉白律師、赴市政府請願、至夜八時、而金永鐸始由法領交涉釋出、</p>
<p>（以死相拚安然出險）</p>
<p>金永鐸自法領署釋出、後、輾轉而入東新橋大滬飯店、開六零六號房間、即邀稽翥靑前往、籌議脫險之法、即金妻崔惠淳亦不知金寓何處其時南北車站漢奸及日探密佈、加以受傷甚重、稽乃請十字會某名醫爲之診治、至四日晨、稽以汽車乘金氏父子、謂金曰、此刻如日探襲擊、余决以自衛槍抵抗、寗願同歸於盡、不受日探俘獲、設日探跟金跡而至、余將百口難辭、今日爲閣下生死關頭、亦即余之生死關頭、金等下樓、同乘車赴稽友鄭某君之家、鄭謂南北車站均不可去、容設法避免、有間、謂由某路馳車赴某處决無危險、金等信其言、逐同車下鄕、住宿村鎭、至六日始至安全地界、七日已有信致滬申謝、</p>
<p>（搜集證據準備控訴）</p>
<p>稽翥靑以黃展英將案中文卷、會中秘密、報告日領凡屬盟員、除與黃同流台沔者、决不與、黃黨妥洽、現正搜集一年來之經過、公布社會、並擬控告黃展英以危害罪、已於昨日呈請當局、依法究辦矣、稽翥靑爲漣水人、旅滬有年、近三月來、稽氏往返靑江浦及南京等處、未與金氏父子會面、亦未與黃展英等晤談、逐釀此禍稽乃搜集事實、原文叙述此案甚詳明日可以公布、</p>
<p>（金澈放棄發還財物）</p>
<p>金永鐸代表律師蔡曉白、前曾致函法領署</p>
<p>要求轉向日領、追索</p>
<p>沒收之財物、茲蔡律師巳得法領回函、惟日方所沒收之財物、幷未退還原主、僅交法領暫爲保留、其原函云、敬覆者、頃由日領送來寗波商業銀行存摺洋一百七十五元五角九分另現銀五元三角、及其他雜零碎物等、暫爲保存、俟查明金永鐸之國籍後、當即交還等語、但昨聞金澈已致函某駐滬友人、囑通知蔡曉白律師、對於日領署送還之金錢物品等不必具領、情甘放棄、惟盼努力交涉保護中法兩國主權之尊嚴、勿因此造成不良禍端、貽害未來之歸化僑民與韓國僑民及其他各色僑民、對於吳凱聲律師交涉大綱、極爲贊同　　（歸化證書攝影研究）</p>
<p>金永鐸之歸化證書、經法領寄赴北平法公使館後、已由法方攝一照片、寄法研究原證書遂於昨日由法領送交金之代表律師蔡曉白、</p>
<p>（伍澄宇函申辯原委）</p>
<p>伍澄宇律師昨函各報云逕啓者、刻閱報載、有金澈之友談話謂展英隨鄙人甚久、因相信鄙人之故、致遭此禍、閱之殊爲詫異查黃展英係於一二八戰事後、無處棲身、僅曾在敝事務所南京路一零七號時寄住、迨後敝事務所他遷、黃已離去、並非敝處受薪職員、至於韓人方面、弟係本年二三月間、始識金永鐸金哲兩君於冠牛園、金澈未晤時、冠生園黄某在塲或即於此時認識、更非弟爲之介紹、且報載金澈謂與黃相識、尙在去歲、其時弟個人未與金君相識、又何從因而相信、自十九路軍離滬、弟於救國團體、久已停止活動、黃某與金君如何來往、槪不知情、貴報所登某君之言、因五日稽翥靑君來所談及各報所載之言、故即往晤稽君、獲悉金哲君之函、當已一面去函請將詳細情形函復、至恐黃某果有冐用鄙人名義、登報限期答復、否則依法呈請緝究誠恐外間不問眞相、請將此函登出、正擬函間、又於八日見各報所載金哲語人一段、閃爍之間、似有意牽涉鄙人、豈知安昌浩被捕以後、弟絕未與金君一晤面、所謂某君日久到所與黃展英及另有某君者商議濟助、弟以救人之急、在所面談、亦不阻止、而弟更未有願出多金之語、縱他人或有其事、弟亦不掠人之美、黃展英與某君如何、絕不知情、至黃某懸弟之牌子一事此爲滬上律師通有之事、且亦係爲律師業務之事、非爲律務、自不負任何責任、惟查近日新聞屢出欲牽入鄙人、必有某君在内、得無某君於五日到弟處因所意弗獲、而别有作用乎、除函某君外、請貴報照實紀載、免外間不明眞相、致生誤會、並乞以後關於鄙人名譽方面、在此毫無憑證、請爲勿登、致生糾紛、實紉公誼、</p>

<h3>第四敎學要點</h3>
<p>（一）選材宜切合兒童的需要、並須兼願兒童的程度和能力、</p>
<p>（二）在可若範圍内、和勞作、自然、社會等聯絡成整個的單元敎學、例如、㈠在食的設計中、敎學食物食桌的安放、排列、設色專圖案問題、㈡在衣的設計中敎學衣、帽鞋和各種衣料相關的圖案問題、㈢在住的設計中、敎學建築式樣、各室佈置家具設備和選擇等的圖案問題㈣在土、竹、木金工品設計中敎學箱籃、杯碟瓶鉢等所連帶的圖案問題、在行的設計中、敎學舟、車、橋梁、道路業所連帶的圖案問題㈥在印刷工業的設計中、敎學書報雜誌日歷、卡片招貼和其他印刷品所連帶的圖案問題、上述各種設計各年都可兼有、從此等設計中尋求美術原則的應用、以增長美的經騐、養成藝術的眼光、辨别優劣、潠擇物品布置環境的能力這才顯見美術敎學的效用、</p>
<p>（三）美術的發表、可在繪畫剪貼的應用中、充分利用樹葉草葉、花瓣種子、鳥羽、魚鱗貝殻、蝶翅、蠶　砂土、破碎的陶瓷片等、裝排成極有趣味的美術品、這在鄉村小學中、更爲適用、（四）名家作品（名畫、名刻（、織品樣本、書本報紙的封面畫和廣告畫、小說中所有的插畫（如滑稽畫諷剌畫等）郵畫片日歷和各種陶瓷器漆器等、都是欣賞研究的良好資料、應充分　　的搜羅盡量的應用、</p>
<p>（五）在可能範圍内、應該按照兒童的程度需要、設備便於敎學美術的美術室、學校環境的藝術化也應在可能範圍内設法、丨丨但美術的敎學、如自然界的欣賞、美術的參觀展覽、校外的寫生（高年級）尊、不限定在敎室中做、</p>
<p>（六）欣賞是本科重要的作業、應該按兒童的程度和需要隨時啟導兒童欣賞、在每次敎學開始、要用描繪形容的演講式、或詩詞警名或足以激引感情、啟發想像的問題、······以式起兒童欣賞的動機、在兒童注意欣賞的時候、除簡單的說明以補充想像外、關於圖中的知識和畫法等問題、不可詳細討論、但高年級也可從欣賞開端以研究（畫法及雕刻法等）結束、關於中外藝術家的生活、軼事和描寫藝術的詩歌、也可隨所欣賞的對象而乘機提供、</p>

<p>一九三二年體育凌亂之網球局面中</p>
<h3>論世界英雄</h3>
<p>予盾衝突···但最前十名梵恩斯第一···毫無疑義丨透路社之意見丨</p>
<p>倫敦八日路透電如欲分析確定一九三二年世界網球名手之最前十名、必發現今年凌亂顚錯之局面、在大節目大比賽如美洲英國之錦標賽、及台維斯杯賽中、時常發見矛盾衝突之結果勝負不常、成敗無定、但在此局面中、梵恩斯應列第第一名、毫無疑義、茲將最前十名之名手、依次分析論之、</p>
<h3>㈠梵恩斯（美）</h3>
<p>梵之居首席、無人可以加以否認、勝於惠勃爾登、再勝於美國林山、尙未有敢向其挑釁者、天才之世界霸王、已確切證明、其發球、不稍讓鐵爾登其若含有電力之抽射、準確無比、</p>
<h3>㈡柯顯（法）</h3>
<p>柯顯列第二、因全美</p>
<p>網球會中、得决賽權</p>
<p>、此里昂之法國名將、稱雄世界有年、但一九三二年爲其王國沒落之開始、可毫無疑問、</p>
<h3>㈢巴羅屈拉（法）</h3>
<p>在台杯却令治賽</p>
<p>中對美國之成績</p>
<p>必予巴羅屈拉以第三名之地位、法國能保持台杯、巴氏一人之功、第一單打勝梵思斯、最後一日勝愛律生、雖美國聲稱其勝愛律生、爲一含有疑問之不公之判决、但此種爭論、僅起於美人之中、似非運動精神所許、</p>
<h3>㈣愛力生（美）</h3>
<p>愛列第四、全美綢球大會中、得複賽權、與柯顯戰至五盤而敗、台杯中亦與巴羅屈拉、五盤分勝負</p>
<h3>㈤塞德（美）</h3>
<p>塞德在全美賽中、大</p>
<p>顯身手、以六比二、</p>
<p>六比零、七比五勝奥斯汀、而爲唯一能力抗梵恩斯者、複賽中、曾先勝梵恩斯二盤、第三盤僅差一分、卽可造一直落三之驚人紀錄、</p>
<h3>㈥潑倫（德）</h3>
<p>潑倫在台杯中之特殊表演、因以第六名列</p>
<p>之勝潘莱、奥斯汀以及希爾士、</p>

<p>自由談短篇小說方形堡的攻克（二）  法國美美作美影譯　　個砲兵中隊安置在我們的右邊，另一個安置在我們的左邊，可是兩隊都遠在我們的前面。這兩隊砲兵對敵人開始猛烈轟擊，敵人也很有力的回答着，不一會舍威里諾方形堡便消失在濃厚的硝烟裏面了。　　我們這一聯隊差不多都伏在一片凹地裏避免着俄國人的砲火　對於我們本來發射得很少的俄國人的槍彈（因爲他們偏重於射擊我們的砲兵）都在我們的頭上經過，或最多送給我們一點泥土或小石罷了。　　等到前進的命令一下，我的中隊長便很注意的望着我，這使我不得不兩次三番的摸着我年靑的鬍子，盡力裝着一種毫不在乎的神氣。並且我那時並不害怕，我所躭心的祇是别人以爲我害怕。這些不傷人的彈丸還沒有使我那種英雄的鎭靜發生搖動。我的自尊心告訴我我在冒着一個眞正的危險，因爲我究竟在一個砲隊的砲火之下呀。我那時很高興我自已能夠那様處之泰然，我並想着以後在普魯望斯街Ｂ夫人的沙龍中濱講攻克舍威里諾方形堡時的樂趣。聯隊長從我們的中隊前經過，他對我說··丨好啦，你開始便會嘗到一點兒微醉的味道啦。　　我以一種非常勇敢的様子微笑着，一面拂着衣袖上的塵土，因一顆子彈落在距離三十步左右的地方，送來了一點兒灰塵。　　俄國人似乎已經發覺他們的彈丸毫無成績；因爲他們換着一種可以比較容易打着我們隱藏着的凹地的砲彈。一個頗大的爆發，轟去了我的軍帽，反我旁邊的一個人打死了。　　丨恭喜你，中隊長對我說，當我把帽子檢了回來的時候，你今天可以沒事了。　　我知道這種軍事上的迷信的，這種迷信以爲Nonbixinldem（同様的事不做第二次）這句公理可以像適用在法庭上一様適用在戰塲上。我很驕傲的把軍帽戴上。丨這可以不要儀式使得别人舉行敬禮。我盡力做着快樂的様子說。這個拙劣的笑話，因爲恰好合着當時的情形的原故，似乎成了很好的笑話。　　丨賀着你，中隊長再說着，你再不會有什麽危險了，並且你今晚可以指揮一個中隊··因爲我感到這是給我的一個預告。我每次受傷之前，我旁邊的軍官總受到一個死彈。並且他以一種較低的幾乎可恥的聲音濃說道··他們的名字常是用一個Ｐ字開始的。　　我保持着我的鎭靜··别的人也會同我一様的；别人也會同我一様受着這些預言的打擊的。那時我毫沒有經騐，我覺得我不能把我的感情告訴任何人，我覺得我應當始終現得大膽的様子。　　半點鐘後，俄國人的砲火已經減少很多了；於是我們從凹地出來，向方形堡進發。　　我們的聯隊是以三個步兵隊組成的。第二步兵隊担任由山峽那邊去包抄方形堡；其餘兩隊担任正面攻擊。我是隷屬第三隊的。　　　　我們從遮護我們的那種肩牆似的凹地後面跑出來時，便接連幾次受着排槍射擊，但這種射擊並沒有使我們的隊伍蒙着多大損害。子彈飛過時的聲音使我吃驚着，我常常回轉頭去，因此引起聽慣了這種聲音的同伴們和我開了一些玩笑。　　總而言之，我心想，打仗並不是那麽可怕的事情。英雄「英雄」是什麽？  星子　　對於英雄在這世界許多人似乎都感覺着特别的味道，而且都甘心削尖腦袋朝着這一頂自認爲光榮的花冠裏鑽。這様，（英雄）兩字，便支配了人類的思想幾千年。當然，在削尖腦袋使勁向冠裏鑽的人們看來，這打算，並不算錯。理由是　··我們即不數說那立馬垓下，叱咤風雲，或拔劍起舞，慷慨悲歌，下而至於行者武松景陽崗打虎之類的故事，就是當一個人在大盞小盞喝飽了黃酒面紅耳赤之後，敞開胸膛，「拍」使勁打一下，同時高呌出一聲「喝」的時候，這氣槪，也就夠人豎起大姆指齊聲喝釆了，而在這釆　之下，我們的「好漢」該是怎樣的風光！何况這還只是「匹夫之勇」，並不能算是十足的「英雄」。至於十足的英雄，則大都是能爬上　個高高的寳座，把一切的「非英雄」馴伏在他的脚尖前。丨丨所以，一部人類歷史，說得切實一點，即是好漢們爭奪這頂花冠的記錄。　　然而，這一頂花冠之奪行，並不是　椿容易事。譬如··位將爺想成名，便先得使千萬人化成白骨，英雄們所高踞的寳座，便正是這無量數的白骨砌成的，而且他又必以無量數的白骨做階梯，才能爬上這高高寳座。譬如，當聯軍統師霞飛和福煦戰勝歸來，在萬衆歡呼聲裏，傲然地跨過凱旋門的時候，你可曾數淸在他們的脚尖前作成了多少墟墓？　　但就另一方面說··假使一旦英雄的脚底下所踐踏的寃魂，以及馴伏在他的寳座前的羊羣都起來和他算賬，則「英雄」便將立刻從寳座上滾下，這裏，我們又只能看見「羣衆」的「偉力」。你看，那所謂蓋世英雄的拿破崙，到最後還不是被拉下了英雄的寳座？　　　「英雄」便不過如是，然而，在這世界，還儘有不少的人在做着「英雄」的夢。談「幽默」  侍桁　　「幽默」這個名詞，已經成爲現在中國流行的語言了，便這個名詞的定義很難下，它是從英語Hmour這個字譯轉來的，不過你若翻過幾本英語字，典的時候，你了便可以曉行這個字義是怎様地難於解釋了。　　這個名詞的意義雖難於解釋，但凡是眞實理解這兩個字的人，一看見它們，便會極自然地在嘴角上浮現去一種會心的微笑來，所以你若聽見一個人的談話或是看見一個人作的文章，其中有能使你自然地發出會心的微笑的地方，你便可斷定那談話中或文章中，是含有「幽默」的成份；或者呼那談話，是幽默的談話··呼那文章，是幽默的文章，也未爲不可。在西歐的文藝的分野上，幽默的作家和幽默的作品，已經顯然成爲一大流派了。　　在這裏我想特别談一談的，是「幽默」與中國國民性的問題。　　若不是過於武斷的話，我可以說，中國的民族是一種完全不能理解「幽默」的蠻野的民族，一個人能夠使用「幽默」與理解「幽默」，不只是文化敎養的需要，而同時也是需要一種適於「幽默」的人生的哲學的，中國人在人生裏，唯一的正道，是板面孔過日子的，他的笑是利已的笑，是矯傲滿足的笑，是性慾發洩的　　從沒有享受過單純的會心的微笑。這種笑是一種人生上的幸福，而中國民族却是絕對與這種幸福無緣的，所以從這個立脚點上來說，中國的民族是一種最可憐的民族。　　中是人每逢三五成羣，時常也談些笑話，但那笑話，總是屬於低級趣味的多，男人多半是關於女人的事，女人則多半是關於男人的事，而且一向是脫離不開性慾。魯迅先生當年論國駡，指示出中國的駡人總是離不開性慾的事實，其實若放大了講。中國人的閒談，只要一稍放縱，也總是離不開性慾的。而且一般的中國人之養成這種習慣，還是有源可尋的。我們民族的兒童，沒有聽過「說書」或「相聲」之流的很少，而這種「說書」與「相聲」，在可能的限度内，總是參雜進性慾的分子。北平最有名的貧嘴大家「雲　飛」和「花狗熊」，是其尖端的表現，可以說凡是到過北平的人，縱或沒有去過天橋，但這兩個人的名字，總不會沒有聽見過吧，他們的影響也就由此可知了。不只在實生活裏是這様，就在中國的古文學裏以性慾的發洩而代「幽默」的地方，也是不可枚舉的，在元曲選裏，就有這様的句子··「莫不是要×你姊姊的黑窟窿」。（這是四名引子之中的一句，可惜原書不在手下，不能寫出全部了。）　　所以要改造中國人的這種低級趣味，除去正規的大衆敎育之外，大衆化的文學是更負有極大的責任。要怎様才能使一般大衆在實生活裏絕對棄絕了這種低級本能的發洩，而更養成一種高尙幽默的氣質，這是刻不容緩的大問題了。　　五四的新文學以後，雖然時常有短篇的可以稱爲幽默的作品出現，但究竟是屬於極少數的例。像英國的查利斯，蘭勃與柴斯恃屯，美國的馬克，屠恩，俄國的柴霍甫，那様幽默的大家，中國至今還是沒有的。就是再退一步講，極適當的新鮮的「幽默」，在新文藝界也很難尋到。新文藝作品中的「幽默」，不是流爲極端的滑稽，便是變成了冷嘲，最好的例，我們可指了舍予先生的作品。「幽默」旣不像滑稽那様使人　笑，也不是像冷嘲那様使人在笑後而覺着辛棘，它是極適中的使人在理知上以後在情感上感到會心的甜蜜的微笑的一種東西。　　孤獨冰瑩　　我覺得再沒有比孤獨的生活還快樂還舒暢的了！至少我敢這様武斷，什麽生活都是麻煩的，令人討厭的，而只有孤獨的確是可愛的，痛快的，因此我常常一個人大聲的呌喊着··　　「我愛孤獨，我要追求孤獨！」於是我的决心就如此下了！　　自然，事情絕不是如此簡單，而且也不是偶然的，這愛孤獨的由來固然大半是由於個性使然，然而也不能不歸之於環境。　　現在，我是得到解放了！我什麽苦痛也沒有，什麽責任也沒有，什麽麻煩我的，使我流淚，使我痛心的事通通沒有了，我快活，上帝，我完全得到了精神上物質上的大解脫！　　是的，也許有人不相信我的話，以爲我一定有另一種苦痛的，但是自已願意忍受的苦痛，那就不能認爲苦痛了！比方撲火的飛娥，她明明知道火傷害她的翅膀甚至牠的生命，但牠拼命地向前猛飛，向前亂撞，一直到牠生命滅亡的時候，我們說牠可憐嗎！說她痛苦嗎？牠是爲了這求光明而犧牲，　雖然死了，也是有代價的，快樂的。這是小虫，也許我們可以說牠是沒有，談的必要的小動物，說不上什麽犧牲，追求。但是我們人類呢？有多少爲革命而流血而犧牲生命的。他們何嘗不知道推翻舊的社會組織，創造新的世界是不容易的，需要經過很艱難困苦的奮鬥，需要流血犧牲，需要多少次的失敗才能得到最後的成功。然而他們每個從事眞正革命的人，都是抱定了宗旨不顧一切地向前衝去！他們並不是知道痛苦，而是覺得這苦的滋味中帶着甜，帶着一切未來的希望和光明，因此他就認苦痛就是快樂了。　　我也一様，自然覺得孤獨對於我有許多益處，有我想得到的許多快樂和希望，我才去追求孤獨。　　呵，我是社會的人了！我是完全整個的屬於社會的了！我得到了解放，好容易才解開了縛住自已的鎖練，雖然流了不知多少的淚，心痛過不知多少次，但究竟我得到解放了！　　我討厭一切的麻煩，我痛恨情感的糾纏！有多少有希望的靑年都被愛情葬送了，多少有志的婦女被家庭屠殺了！我不唱救人的高調，但至少先要救出我自已。　　勇敢地走上光明的前途吧，不要迥顧，更不要再走錯路，要知道你的未來是有無限的希望與光明的呵丨地球的年齡  逢壬　　世界大科學家愛因斯坦敎授（Einstein）最近到柏林，在個普通的演講會中，講演宇宙的演進一題，他說地球的年齡，至今有一○，○○○，○○○，○○○歲。這個數目，和一般地質學家，字宙學家認爲滿意的估計，竟相差到七○○○、○○○、○○○年，因此就引起了他們不少的驚奇，其實誰能確斷牠對不對呢！　　本來地球的年齡問題，百年前，已有許多天文學家和地質學家，在那兒爭辯了。開爾溫（Kelvin）爵士，大家都承認他是個算學泰斗的，他根據了行星或然變冷的速率，計算地球的年齡，至多不過四○、○○○、○○○年，後來他又自已改變主張，說地球的年齡爲一○○、○○○、○○○年，但是依照地質學家的估計呢，比較這個數目還要超出多多，他們用計算岩石的年齡，來作爲他們有力的憑證。　　他們用以計算地殼岩石年齡的方法，可分三類。第一是根據海洋中鹽份的多寡而定，第二是根據水成岩的厚薄而定，第三是根據射光物貶損的程度而定。　　第一種方法，因爲最初海洋中是沒有鹽份的，假使我們能夠斷定雨點從石上衝至海洋中的現存的鹽份，需要經過幾多的年數，那麽我們就可得到一個公允的地球年齡的數目了。此法最初由杜柏林大學敎授喬萊氏（J·Joly）倡之於前，繼由霍爾莫斯（ArthnrHolmes）敎授　明於後，他們的結論，斷定地球的年齡爲三六○、○○○、○○○年。其後葛里高勒（J·W·Gregory）博士，認爲鈉的分解率，現在比過去高得多，所以依他的主張，從這數字上應當再乘一個五，變成一、八○○、○○○、○○○年，較爲確實。　　第二種方法，計算由水的冲積物，而變成岩石的直數，比較更爲困難些。些法由　爾莫斯和勃里十敎授（Ｊ·Ｈ·Ｂretz）計算出來，結果得五○○、○○○、○○○年，再因高丘而增加的沉積速度的不同，沒有一定的限額，所以普通又要乘個四字，得二○○○、○○○、○○○年，作爲地球的年齡，似較精確。　　第三種方法，根據射光物貶損的速度，計算地球的年齡，那祇要騐行鈉中所含幾多鉛質的成分就得了。這個方法，於二十五年前爲蒲爾胡特博士（Ｂoltwood）所發明，後來由柯華立克敎授（Koovarik）從俄國西北部加勒里亞（Careli新耶那派萊（Sinyanpala）地方，取得了一塊鈾質的岩石，試騐結果，得一、八五二、○○○、○○○年，認爲這是地球最眞確的年齡。然而愛因斯坦敎授認爲在一○、○○○、○○○、○○○年前，自星霧（Nedulae）推開後，宇宙才開始着擴大的，所以他以爲地球是在這個時代産生的。長篇創作時代与愛的歧路  張資平　　今早晨的霜像　白雪般的遮覆着了一面的田野。海泉一面回憶着昨夜裏和鶴子夫人同到Ｍ劇塲去看映畫戲的情景，一面冒着寒風，走向學校裏來。海泉所進的大學在郊外景色極佳的地方。不過自入冬以來，一切植物都枯萎了，所以一眼望去，四周都呈荒凉的景象。（老林）　　剛踏進校門，便聽見前面有人在呌他。忙抬頭一看，原來是一個同級生姓張名應奎的。他和一位女同學，幷着肩，從化學敎室旁的草場上走向這邊來。海泉見過這個女同學幾次面了，只不知道她的名字。張應奎的西裝，大衣都是簇新的，領帶也是花花鹿鹿的。海泉只是穿一件灰布棉袍子，頸上圍着一條絨圍巾。他和應奎立在一塊，就好像馬路上的大光燈和農家裏的小洋燈的對照。「認得她麽？」　　應奎指着立在他身傍的女生同他。他看見那位女同學的雙頰上略泛出一點桃色，微向他點點頭。「見是見過。不過沒有請敎姓名。」「她我呌卓文君。······」應奎笑着說。「又瞎說了，我不喜歡！」她板起臉孔，拉了拉他的右腕。「莫聽他瞎說，我呌卓淑華，以後請多多指敎，林先生。」她又向着海泉點了點首。「你怎麽知道我姓林？」海泉有點不好意思的，問了她。「他告訴我的。」「那裏！你自已先知道他的名字。」應奎表示着有點不滿意她的說話。她的雙頰上又有點紅了起來。「上課了吧。」「沒。······」卓淑華搶着回答。「······還差十多分鐘。」「老林，不得了，又要月考了！」「對啦。今天十九號，是不是？」「學理科眞苦喲丨」應奎苦笑着說。「我早告訴了你，要快改文科。再在理科多</p>

<p>拍手的拍手，怪呌，似乎有怎麽奇怪的事情，直得大衆這様的注意。　　我好奇心起，就用了三分吃奶力，擠進入圍中去，做一個福爾摩司，探聽探聽··　　陡見一位穿着新衣裳的男子，右手衣袖上·不知從何處染來了滿袖的亮幌幌的油水·在濕淋淋地掛下來，把一件簇嶄全新的華絲葛棉袍，失節似的沾汚了，多麽的可惜啊丨只見他伸直了手，臉漲通紅，似乎内心發現着不少的慚愧似的，抱頭鼠竄地，打從南貨店裏跑出來，向人羣中　圍而去。這時街坊上的人，又是一陣哈哈哈狂笑，並且呌囂着奇怪的議論··「實行眞正揩油了」，「揩油主義的信徒」，「揩油揩得轉彎了」，　　但他們在呌鬧的「揩油」，究是怎麽一套把戲，這男子臂袖上，又是爲怎麽染了這般油水，並且爲何人們見他受着損失，而不加同情的可惜，而反在作反常的冷嘲熱譏呢？倒要打聽一個明白。　　南貨店裏的小夥計，倒笑逐顔開的誠意地告訴我，這個男子，是我們店裏的老主顧，天天到來坐坐，抽抽水烟，談談閒話，習以　爲常。可是他生性貪鄙，任何事情，都歡喜揩油，佔便宜，就是到我們店裏來，也常常實行揩油主義，揀愛吃的，自動手拿來往嘴裏送，老　　因爲他是老主顧，不來和他計較，可是我們的同事李先生，看見他這樣貪鄙成性，心中有些不平的惱怒，於是想出了一個妙計來，懲治他一番，給他一個貪小而失大的眼色。我們見他天天來揩油的，尤其是自動手吃長生菓，因爲我們南貨店，自動手吃長生菓，鄕下有這個例子，不以爲奇，祇是不能天天罷了，但他却天天來假做坐在長生菓的甏上，和我們瞎搭訕頭，同時一隻手，却在暗裏慢慢地伸入坐下的甏裏去，摸取花生吃，我們利用他這弱點，打聽着他在今天要到人家去吃喜酒，必定穿綢着緞，打扮齊整，就預先把花生甏移開，掉一個荳油甏在原處，像陷馬坑般地佈置着，待他來中計。果然今天他吃了喜酒回來，打從這裏經過，又要進來揩油了，眞的，不出我們的所料，故態復萌的又在花生甏上坐下，嘴裏仍在假意搭訕，一隻手却又暗暗伸入座下的甏中去了，可笑丨卜通一聲。急忙縮起來，已經不及，滿袖的油水，已濕淋淋地流下來，實行眞正揩油主義了，全店的人見了，不禁哄堂大笑，他也羞得面紅耳赤，抱頭而去，但這時已引動街坊上的人，於是都聚攏來觀看這一幕趣劇了。會  孫源　　是有這輩人閒着沒有事弄壁報寫女同學的秘史，皇后的艶史，也是有這輩人沒事做組織什麽會什麽會。　　在我們這一科，這學期也有人發起組織××學會。　　當然囉，章程是第一要緊。茶杯大的字的章程貼在佈告板上，條文終是這樣的千篇一律的名稱。宗旨，會員，會期，職員，一條一條的下去，而最重要的會費每學期一元是照例寫在最後第二條的。過了三天。老王丨籌備委員對老葉說··「女同學繳費最爽氣，八位女同學都繳費了，男同學只有三四個繳的。」在開成立大會的前一星期已經貼出斗大字的通告。　　本訂二時開會的，三點鐘已打了，到會人數還不到二分之一。通告上明明寫二時開會，大約不會有人弄錯的罷丨怎麽這様人少呢？尤其奇怪的，是女同學一個也沒有到，尤其奇怪的，是女同學中有一個是籌備委員丨雖然沒有籌備過什麽了沒出席。　　『讓他們她們不來好了，我們茶點可以多吃一點。』老朱還狼呑虎嚥的吃，還笑着說。　　就從這天起，在佈告板上，再也看不見××學會四個字了。大家也不問起，有時偶然有個同學高興問問委員老爺們會務倒底怎樣。　　『你去問老王。』老葉說，『你去产問老葉，』老王說，會······　　中國人的組織精神丨中國人的圑結力丨婚姻的掙扎  佩瑾　　隔壁統廂房裏的健，近來他的神色好像十分萎頓，從前那様勇敢英武的精神，今已變憂悶而消極的態度了。當然，爲生活作牛馬的我，整日裏謀麫包問題還沒空，那裏還有這些閒功夫，去探問他的底細呢丨　　昨夜吃過晚飯之後，我們正在閒談，突然隔壁起了一陣爭辯聲，靜聽之下原來健正在反抗他父親作主的婚姻問題。「結婚麽？還早丨等我能夠自立了再談也不遲，何况我還未滿二十歲的人，對於年齡上講，也還太早哩丨還是讓我現在好好的再求些學問吧丨」健发似很懇切地要求他的父親。「不！我早已同你的母親商量過了，爲兒子結婚這是我們的天職况且你現在也已經到了相當年紀，這個你是無論如何不該違背我的」，他的父親施威似的迫脅着健應允。　　「可是！父親··老實告訴你吧！我是絕對難以承認這種舊式的婚姻，而也極端不願和一個我沒有發生愛情過的陌生人結合，因爲我和她是一些沒有感情的啊·········」「我以爲這門親事，給你配得再好也沒有了，眞是所謂門當戶對。就是她，而貎也不十分錯，性情也沒有什麽不好，也總算讀過幾年書，料理家務也來得，有什麽不願呢？像我們這樣的人家，正用得着這样様一個人哩丨」「·····················」　　「健！還是應允了我，不要再做那自由戀愛的迷夢吧！你看，你的表兄偉，他不就是一個例丨其結果是否美滿，他和淑貞不也是自由結合的麽？那麽怎様去年剛剛結婚，現在又吵着要離婚了呢？醒醒呢丨健丨别再迷着不醒丨「這固是矛盾，且背乎天良的事。」健反抗地說··「這種冒昧的結合，雖然他們的心目中，以爲是自由戀愛，是現在潮流中的新人物，其實，嚴重地說一句，像他們這様，簡直是情塲中的公敵，社會中的罪人吧！我想··我是不會這様，也許是不見得會這様丨」健很奮發的辯覆他。　　「我總是不贊成讓你自由去選擇，我認爲這是非法的結合，結髪夫妻，原是三生前締下的姻綠，命裏早已註定，有什麽願意不願意。」「那麽丨依父親的主見，是毫無挽回的餘地了，我的志願也完絕了，到了必要的時候，那未丨我···只有······出亡·····」。健的音是慢慢地由頭而低了下</p>

<p>去。忽又提高嗓子說··「父親··這種非法的婚姻，我是端難承認的啊！」他好似怨極而嗚咽起來。　　「什麽！你敢出亡麽？一定不允我麽？」他的父親深深地嘆了一口氣，略停了一停，接著又說··「不聽父母之命，媒妁之言，定要私下去結識，唉！眞是「人心不古」，「世道日下」，什麽自由，什麽戀愛丨」　　一段爭辯，總算這様含糊地閉了幕，隔壁靜聽着的我，内心倒汎起了無窮的感想，舊禮敎固然是萬惡，可是現在的新局面呢！是否完美？！想守舊派之所以處處這様在諷剌，攻擊，諒非無因吧！店員通訊交易所與兩合公司等之區别　　編輯先生大鑒··昨閱申報知貴刋有店員通訊欄之發起，殊爲欣慰。從此我商界得所問津，抑亦汪洋中之燈堪也！靜係一學徒，平日對於報章雜誌，大有牆高　窺之慨··因念貴欄旨在善及店員學徒之智識，故不揣冒昧，設有疑問數點，欲借先生寳貴之光陰，及貴刋之一角地。予以答覆。問題如下··　　㈠交易所其營業究屬如何？與拍賣行有甚分别？㈡我國公司向分四種·丨有限無限兩合及股份兩合丨請問兩合公司及股份兩合公司區别何在？以上兩點，難在商業中讀過··第解釋甚簡，不易明瞭，且該時無心研究，尙請詳細闡明，易勝幸甚丨專此，即請摆安　　　忻靜甫啓　　編者按··忻君所提出的這兩個問題，甚爲重要，茲護軌管見所及，解答如下（甲）交易所和拍賣行同是一種特殊買賣的塲所，若專就『以拍板爲交易的最後决定』及『競爭價格』而言，似乎相混，（交易所的買賣方法有相對，投標接續，競爭四種，上海的交易所多採用競爭方法，最易使人誤會。）其實，區别正多。如交易所的主旨在助長生産　節市塲，而拍賣行則專以代替他人將貨物得極適宜的價格出售爲目的··所以，交易所是積極的是　的，拍賣行是消極的是靜的。交易所的手續較繁，如用競爭買賣法，必須委託人，經紀人，代理人連成一氣在監督員之下開始交易；拍賣行則直接交易，相當於交易所的相對買賣。至於拍賣所裏面的物價，大　以件爲單位可以隨時漲跌，且其成交純爲現期的；交易所則不然，每日有前後兩市，每市劃分三盤或四盤，每盤有每盤的市價，於成交時又分現期，延期，定期三種辦法。還有一點須注意者··拍賣行必須將貨物一一陳列在那兒任人選擇與出價，交易所則不必，以致演成買空賣空的現象。附註··交易所的種類很多、營業情形又極複雜，欲知其詳，請閱主恩良編交易所大全及同憲文編商業概論第三十章。倘能作實地觀察爲尤佳。　　乙依公司法第二條的規定，公司分爲··無限公司·２兩合公司·３股份有限公司·４股份兩合公司四種·除第１３非忻君所　暫置勿論外，茲將２４兩種的意義和區别，約略一述。　　凡由無限責任股東和有限責任股東混合而組成的公司，呌做兩合公司··其由無限責任股東和股份有限責任股東混合而組成的公司，呌做股份兩合公司。這兩種公司的不同之點，可由下列三方面觀察出來··　　㈠醵集資金　股份兩合公司的無限責任股東不得認足全部股份，必須留下一部負責募集，以免與無限公司組混；但兩合公司的發起人（多爲無限責任股東）對於股份不能募足時，尙可自行認足。兩合公司中有限責任股東所出的資金，是按名核定額份的··股份兩合公司則分爲若干份，由有限責任股東自由認股。　　㈡公司類别　兩合公司，若將其中有限責任股東除去，則與無限公司無别。股份兩合公司，其中一部份無限責任股東的責任，等於無限公司的股東；另一部份有限責任股東的責任　與兩合公司中的有限責任股東無異··而且有限責任股東對於資金，分股認領，又與股份有限公司相同··所以，股份兩合公司實在三者之間。　　㈢經濟立塲　由經濟的立場來觀察，兩合公司與隠名合夥無大區别，（其不同之點即在隱名合夥是契約關係，而兩合公司則立於法人之地位）至於股份兩合公司，能使企業的無限責任股東和出資的有限責任股東相合作，最適於吸收零散資本爲巨額，以從事偉大的企業，在四種公司裏面要算是最妥善的了。小說寫給友人之妻（續二）  秦瘦鷗　　「周大經能於短時期内用搶親式的手腕把她搶來做自已的失戀底報復的女子，不用問一定是一個給時代所抛棄的舊式女子了。她的無智識，無靈魂，更是不待調查，便可預　的事實。」這是我未曾見到你之前，所存的一個極武端，極藐視的測度。不料這個測度　和事實背離到這般的　啊！　　不但　　一笑以　於　的　　的高度，　　的　色······　凡一切身禮的美，你都超越了　芳。丨　經　來的情人我們　同學，丨百倍以上；而你的清雋的談吐，活潑的舉止，靜雅而又可愛的笑　，更不容非議的確立了女性最高　底美。丨靈魂底美。　　於此，我不能不佩服大經的手腕的高妙，以致於像夢魔一般地昏迷了。我當時竟失却了我固有的活躍而又忽燥的性情，模模糊糊地不知道該怎様說才好；以靜默代替了寒喧，老是莫名其录的在一張沙發上坐着。五分鐘，六分鐘，······許久，才復淸醒過來。　　啊，偉大丨女性美底偉大丨牠的確能夠操縱一切的男人，不論他是怎様的大智慧者。　　狂放得像一頭野馬一様的我，到那天才得到了一個足以操縱我的人，就是你丨美麗的小猪玀丨往常，不是我最愛這様的喚着你嗎？而你也很願意我這様的喚你。所以，如今我雖去了，望戰神的懷抱中馳去了；但是，我永不能捨却這一個比什麽都有味的奇妙的稱謂。我並且已預先打定主意，待到倭奴的槍彈遵約而來的撞進我的心坎來的時候，我也得利用這最後的一刹那，盡我所有的力量，高喊一聲「美麗的小猪玀丨」　　你猜，小猪玀，我現在是到了那裏了？待我來告訴你吧！像長蛇似的津浦車，已在牠努力的前進中，把我帶到了離天津不到二百里路的泊頭鎭了。大槪等我頭頂上的電燈熄滅時，一定可以過唐官屯了。　　泊頭鎭，唐官屯，天津，我究竟爲什麽要上這些跟我無一面之緣的幕生地方來呢？憑我的職業和環境而論，且無上津浦車之必要，但是我現在非但已上了津浦車，還要從天津轉往北平，再由北平而上熱河，朝陽寺，南嶺；也許不抵抗主義者也有睡醒的一天，那未說不定我竟會浴血而入瀋陽咧！可愛的小朋友，小猪玀，你候着吧！　　記得在一二八的事變沒有爆發之前，我用着一種淺近可笑的眼光，和妄自誇耀的心理，曾經三番兩次的在你面前慷慨激昻地表示，如其日本獸軍的砲火，竟在上海附近施虐的時候，我心含着笑，從容踏進這一幕「流血百里，伏屍數萬」的大慘劇中去··甚至還有待我臨去以前，請你賜我一個甜吻的暗示。不幸得很丨日本獸軍並不　像我理想中的一般的小胃口，牠們終於在這國際視聽所繫，東亞第一商埠的上海，　搬演出全武行的好戲來了；而我却從戰事爆發的一天起，直至和約簽定的一天止，始終躱在帝國主義者翼護下的公共租界裏，儘把四面八方所聽來的那些神話工的戰事消息，搬回來和你閒　牙，或是懷着看比球一般的心理，登在高處，極幽閒地欣賞着野戰砲的火花。　　你那時，雖然從不曾用一個含有譏剌性的字來使我難堪過；然而我有時淸夜捫心，却眞感覺到極度的慚愧。　　「無靈魂的畜生！」我常是這様咀咒着自已。不錯，那時候我的確已把整個的靈魂，埋葬在你那波浪形的短髪之中去了　丨　　不過，雖然如此，可是從我平日的主張和行爲上看來，你大槪至小也不能不說我是一個好勇鬭很，氣質暴躁的大頑皮吧？眞的，美麗的小猪玀！讓我告訴你··我實在不是一個毫無血性的懦夫。如其不是兩年前，發現了你這一顆夜明珠似的寳貝，别說一二八，就在九一八的時候，我定然　早在邊疆上用我的鮮血，染浸着我們至可愛的靑天白日的國徽了！</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊影界要聞烏發影片捲土重來之先聲  �甫　　本埠萬國影片有限公司，自從和烏發及烏發高蒙聯合公司，簽訂了五年合同以後，於是歐洲的影片，又大舉向着中國電影界攻進來了。在最近的將來，就要在　映的，有麗琳哈蕙，亨利加拉，康勒維特和麗爾丹哥娃合演的「龍翔鳳舞」CongressDances；莎麗曼莉　和漢斯亞爾培氏合演的音樂喜劇「春波艶影」MonteCarloMadness；麗琳哈蕙和「歡喜緣」主角賈克霍爾勃等合演的「樂陶陶」HappyEverAlter;伊密爾詹寗斯主演的「慾潮」	StormofPassion此片曾於上月一月中開映於巴黎一百家戲院，成績的優美，不問可知；此外還有很多片子，也說不了這許多。　　據萬國公司傳出消息，第一部影片，或將開映「龍翔鳳舞」這部影片，不但因爲是製片大家歐利克龐麥ErichPommer和大導演家歐利克却克賽爾ErichCharxell的心血結晶，技巧方面，臻於化境；並且一切音樂，是由音樂大家華納罕門WernefHayman配譜的。　　故事的發生，是在西歷一八一二年拿破侖失敗後，凡與戰事有關係的國家，相約在維也納舉行善後會議，俄皇亞力山大，也特地從俄國跑到維也納去參加這次會議，他有一位寵愛的臣子呌比比可夫，面貎極和他相似，俄皇常把比比喬裝已身模様來愚弄大家；而他自已有閒空工夫的時候，復喬裝一位軍官模様，獨逢到外面去閒逃，因此就和一位小家碧玉發生了一段浪漫的艶跡，不意好事多磨，會議塲上，正在舉行跳舞大會的時候，忽報拿破侖又已在法登岸，於是在會人員，如鳥獸散，而俄皇也就撤了他的愛人，回到俄國去了。　　上面的一段話，是從外國報上譯下來的，拿它作爲烏發影片捲土重來的小介紹，關於上面所說的影片底詳評，祇好等到公映的時候再談了閱者意見談談戰事影片  靑君　　據我們所看過的戰事影片，一方面總是帶寫着兒女之情的。「地獄天使」總算不向這方面着力了，然而裏面還有個把女角附演着，照在下所看過的，則惟有不久以前在巴黎大戲院放映的「鐵血主義，」眞可稱做「男性的影片，」因爲此片自始至終，沒有一位女角在裏邊。　　並且此片以男兒爲國犧牲做結局，是屬於悲劇。照文藝批評法來講··喜劇是屬於優美，悲劇是屬於壯美。所以無疑的，「鐵血主義」是兩重的男性影片。　　不過，話又說回來了，現在有許多銀幕評論家對於外國戰事片，常認爲是帝國主義者的麻醉品，且比爲「糖衣的毒藥。」這實在也是我們不能否認的。所以我們不得不迫切求國産偉大戰事片的出世了！因爲愛情片是世界性的，他國之片映於我國似無什麽妨礙。戰事片則是國家性的，英人的戰事片當然鼓勵英國國民而寫英國的雄威，德人的戰事片當然鼓勵德國國民而寫德國的雄威。以這種影片移映於我國，自然是不免「長他人威風，短自家志氣」了。　　寫完這段時，念念不忘地盼望我國製片公司能早早以「鼓勵民氣」的偉大作品來剌激我們國民。（稿酬乞移助義軍）影星小評胡蝶·陳玉梅·阮玲玉  瑞英　　胡蝶·陳玉梅·阮玲玉是明星，天一聯華三公司的台柱，各個表現的技巧完全不同丨値得來比較一下的。胡蝶··資格是在女明星中最老丨只是她的作風却永遠只會站在水平線上，胡蝶扮起一個端莊的小妞來是頗合身扮的，要是呌、她做一個反派演員，她是勉强了。所以在「啼笑因緣」中裝何麗娜頗爲得當丨而扮沈鳳喜却勉强了。陳玉梅··陳玉梅起初在「芸蘭姑娘」裏看她不見不分出色，但看過「蘭谷萍蹤」後！知道她是在急速的進步。陳玉梅善做悲劇的主角。最好使她扮一個女學生，不要使她扮一個「賢妻良母」。她的作風頗有些像DilliamGish她的眼睛的表情是超過任何人的·一種悵然而悲痛的情狀，可由幕上活躍到觀衆的心底，這是她成功的地方。阮玲玉··以表情風騷著名，這實在不是「風騷」，而是「活潑」，阮玲玉在「野草閒花」的一幕中的表情，我幾乎疑心她是「復活」中的桃樂絲得里奥了。婀娜的身裁，媚人的眼睛，極能引得一般靑年對她着迷，而不想再看麥唐娜的片子了丨阮玲玉的表情之可愛，絕對不是「小鳥依人」，而是「軟玉溫香」。最近聞得她將必變作風了。中國影戲院小統計  趙樹奎　　全中國有二百三十九家影戲院　一九二七年時只有一百零六家　三年中增加了一倍多　二十四個大城市有影戲院　其中八個城市已演有聲電影、　　全中國影戲院共有十三萬六千九百九十四個座位、　一九二七年只有六萬八千五百十二個　三年中也增加一倍多、一九三零年的上半年、　美國片運入中國的尺數是一百零一萬三千零四十四尺、　百分之六十七是有聲片、　一九三一年這半年美國片運人中國的尺數是一百零一萬五零四十四尺、　百分之八九　是有聲片　從一九二一年至一九三零年中國成立一百六十四家製片公司、　但是只有五十三家出過片子、　一九二九年的出品不到五十部、今年春天　只剩了六家、因此次戰事關係　有大多數都受影響　現已破産或另行改組、　　全中國有二十三家經理影片機關　計美國八法國二、德國一、中國十一、　　上海全埠有五十三家影戲院　二十七家演有聲片（按此係滬變前）滬戰後有影院（遊藝場附帶者在内）四十六家均可映聲片編者按、上述統計、恐多錯誤或變遷、茲姑錄之以待　證而已、國片紹介國片紹介城市之夜  燦爛　　城市之夜，已經成了現在各報端唯一的好賣料了；一定會有許多人、希望知道些牠的内容。牠是聯華公司導演費穆的處女作。　　主演仍舊星聯華的兩位大台柱丨丨金熖和阮玲玉。他們表演如何，是另一問題，不過至少可以相信有把握的。講到配角，幾乎沒有一個不是由費穆親自去尋訪得來的。就是所謂的臨時演員，了是親自一個一個找來的，並沒用現成介紹所的人。這片子許多地方是取景於實地的借了工廠或是其他勞動的場所，來攝成城市繁華銷金上丨的北背面，表出金迷紙醉的社會是築在貧民血汗上的。這點恐怕别人都沒有注意到過。　　片中的置景，最注重在貧民生活方面，我們可以找到許多極平常丨但是極動人的貧民寫實還有一點是極可注意的，就是費君在影界中，是發起了革命。因爲根本社會化的影片，是描寫現實的，所以他只希望觀衆記得一少年，一老者一女　······以及其他就很夠了。這是外國片中常可看見，而在國片中，却是創舉。本埠調查别開生面的南方影片公司  初　　薛覺先所辦的，南方影片公司，本刋前已介紹過。提起薛覺先，他對於電影，並不是個新進人物。記得在五六年前，他早經在滬上拍過一張『浪蝶』導演和主演都出他個人一力擔當。這片因爲他和粤劇有悠久的歷史，也曾在港粤之間閧動一時。今年六月間，他又感覺得電影的功能日趨廣大，爲求使他的藝術得到更普遍的傳達計，他毅然捨棄舞台生活，來滬組織南方影片公司。　　這箇南方公司係别開生面的一箇影片公司，牠除製片之外，兼營其他業務。計内設印刷部，專印美術宣傳圖畫；製版部，專製彩色及單色，銅鏱版，木器部，專製各項新式傢私；船務部，代理香港漢運洋行船務。此外又獲得上海及華北總經理權，代理德國柏林司華士哥夫廠所有出品。以薛君的過去經騐和辦事的魄力，而論該公司的前途，必定係很有作爲的。一對英美老搭擋  小夥子　　老萊和大胖子哈台眞是天生的一對滑稽老搭擋，他們有魔力能呌你的嘴吧笑得合不攏，害你肚皮笑疼伸不直腰！眞的，他們倆在一千九百二十六年搭擋合夥以後，他們的才能都有了顯著的驚人的發展和成績。勞萊今年才三十八歲，比哈台小三歲，體重要比哈台輕一百三十磅。他是英國人，從小七歲時候就跟着他的父母上舞台演戲了··十六歲到美國；二十三歲那年才踏進電影界。哈台是美國人，他是個喬其亞大學法科畢業生，對於電影很早就有特殊的愛好。他從二十二歲就開始度着演影戲的生涯，一直到現在，他已有了二十年的經騐了臨時演員的幸運  星宿　　聯合公司自從聘了幾位在電影界已有地位的，導演和男女明星南下後，就將進行攝片，但因在香港廣州等處，難以招致有鏡頭的臨時演員，對於攝片工作上，自必很感困難，于是不得不來滬邀請，現已邀得十人，决於八日起程赴港，都是上海電影臨時演員最著名的聚集處「馬立師」一帶的人物，領隊的是曾在友聯公司」度做過基本演員的姜又佾，起程以前，每人得領旅費十元，和薪工一月三十元，按臨時演員薪工，係照拍戲日數計算，聯合待遇這般臨時演員，却是發給月薪，已有基本性質，所以這次被聯合邀去的臨時演員，莫不喜形於色云，影塲談屑你曉得不？  曉谷　　卓别靈初次在無線電　發音，費了許多氣力。演講完了，他的體重輕了　磅。也許這是他反對有聲影片的理由之一。　　蓋拉萊寳有一次收到了一百多頭狗。因爲有一位記者發表一篇談話，說她最歡喜狗；所以一般崇拜她的人們都拿狗來送給她。　　希佛萊和派拉蒙公司訂的合同中有一個極特異的條件，以後他在銀幕上講英語的時候，不許不用重音，這就是要他講他那法蘭西式的英語，而不許他說純粹的英語。申報電影專刋投稿略例一　本刋歡迎投稿一經登載酬報從豐一　文字旣經登載給酬版權槪屬申報所有一　來件如係譯文應附原著一　本刋篇幅有限文字應力求簡短每稿以五百字左右爲限一　文字照片等等除預先聲明及附回函郵資者外槪不負保存或退還之責電影專著眞笑與假笑  陳大悲　　現在所謂的攝影塲裏是沒有人道，不講慈悲的，所以有人說，攝影塲的生活和軍隊的生活相差不遠。你的疲倦和你的病痛斷不能引起當軸者的注意，使他們少顧慮到些公司的金錢損失，而暫時停止其正在進行的工作。除非你已成了明星，你是斷不能享到這様的幸福的。　　因爲這個緣故，我勸你在這練習表情的時候，先把這笑的一種表情練成一個習慣。對着鏡子就多練練你的笑容。能夠每日無端的對鏡發捧腹大笑兩次以上就是再好的一種習慣。這一種習慣練成之後，不但在你身體方面所受的損失可以補救一點，就連你的精神上也可以多得到些安慰。笑容可掬的人總比雙眉緊鎖的人容易博得攝影塲同伴們的好感些。眞笑練過之後，獨習法的第七式就是練習假笑。　　假笑包刮奸笑，譏笑，冷笑，等等惡意的笑。雖然名爲笑，其實和第五式的驕忌性質差不多，不過因爲在面部筋肉的運動上和眞笑相彷，所以不得不歸他爲笑的一類。假笑完全是惡意的。所以也和驕忌一様，我勸你只是在練習的時候用力的練習一番。練習過後，除了將來在鏡頭工作心需的時候，我希望你不要把這一類的表情練成了習慣，影響到你的日常生活，這一種不好的影響和上面說的眞笑的影響恰恰相反，以夠使得你在同倖中無端造成許多的敵人。</p>

<h3>Small Country Faces Off Against Japan</h3>
<p>Proposed Draft Resolution Citing Japan</p>
<p>Japanese Representative Threatens Withdrawal from League, Demanding Retraction</p>
<p>Large and Small Countries Continue to Express Opinions on the Manchurian Incident</p>
<p>(Geneva) At ten fifteen this morning, the League of Nations continued its General Assembly. Representatives from Ireland, Spain, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden submitted a draft resolution requesting the League to deny that the September 18th Incident was an act of self-defense by Japan, declaring that the creation of "Manchukuo" was a result of the presence of Japanese troops, and therefore, recognizing it would violate international obligations. Finally, it was suggested that the United States and Russia be invited to join the Nineteen-Nation Committee for joint discussion. Matsuoka expressed opposition to the draft resolution and demanded its withdrawal. Canada expressed agreement with Japan's opinion. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that the signatory countries of the four-nation proposal advocate that the proposal submitted under the names of Switzerland and Czechoslovakia be processed first to avoid a vote on a proposal containing articles that do not recognize "Manchukuo." This case will only compile the speeches and other documents related to this dispute and submit them to the Conciliation Committee for consideration. It is noted that the proposal submitted under the names of Switzerland and Czechoslovakia specifically addresses the matter of the Special Committee. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Before the meeting this afternoon, there was a tense atmosphere in the General Assembly hall and the audience seats. Representatives stood closely discussing Japan's attitude toward the four-nation proposal. Small countries also held a meeting, but it is reported that they are unwilling to withdraw their proposal. It is rumored that the Japanese representative will not be satisfied with merely submitting the case to the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the League of Nations meeting this morning, after the reading of the proposals submitted by Spain, Ireland, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden, Japanese representative Matsuoka, seeing the unfavorable situation, resorted to his final measure, making a threat to withdraw from the League of Nations for the first time in public. He firmly stated that the case did not comply with the principles of the League of Nations and the Lytton Report, demanding its immediate withdrawal. Otherwise, he would ask the Chairman to immediately put it to a vote. If the proposal passed, he feared there would be consequences that the proposers could not have anticipated. Upon hearing this, the audience was shocked like a bolt from the blue. The proposers immediately left the meeting to hold private consultations. The Japanese representative's words clearly implied that if the case passed, Japan would withdraw from the League of Nations. (National News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The four countries of Spain, Ireland, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia submitted a resolution to the General Assembly, which aroused protests from the Japanese representative. The representatives of the four countries then met after the adjournment of the General Assembly to discuss. It is reported that they are determined to maintain the original text of the draft resolution. Therefore, the draft resolution will be put to a vote at the General Assembly. If it is passed by a two-thirds majority, it will be submitted to the Nineteen-Nation Committee. However, whether the draft resolution can obtain this majority is highly doubted by various opinions in the General Assembly lounge. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi's Speech</h3>
<p>Any Solution</p>
<p>Must be Based on the Covenant</p>
<p>Direct Negotiations are Impossible</p>
<p>Under the Current Situation in the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, our country's representative Guo Taiqi spoke at the League of Nations General Assembly, saying that any solution must be based on the Covenant and China's sovereignty and integrity, and that direct negotiations are impossible under the current situation. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese representative Guo Taiqi spoke at the League of Nations General Assembly today, declaring that China accepts British Foreign Secretary Simon's proposal to first hand over the task of drafting a solution to the Manchurian incident to the Nineteen-Nation Committee, and invite the United States and Russia to join, and then submit the drafted measures to the General Assembly for approval. He said that the Chinese government agrees with the British proposal because it is based on Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report and is governed by that chapter. Guo also strongly requested the General Assembly to pass a resolution prohibiting the recognition of the Manchurian puppet organization and supporting the boycott of Japanese goods as a move by the Chinese people to resist Japan's aggression in Manchuria, saying that Simon's speech on this issue did not align with China's views. (National News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Government Instructions to the Delegation</h3>
<p>Please Nineteen-Nation Committee Swiftly Seek a Solution</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the League of Nations General Assembly will close within days, and the entire case will be sent to the Nineteen-Nation Committee for discussion and resolution. At this meeting, the representatives of small countries upheld justice, but the representatives of large countries were too cautious, and there was no significant progress in substance. It is reported that the government has instructed our delegation to request the Nineteen-Nation Committee to seek an appropriate solution promptly after accepting the entire case. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Draft Resolution of the Four Countries</h3>
<p>Do Not Recognize the Puppet State Under Japanese Tutelage, Advocate Inviting the United States and Russia to Participate in Conciliation Negotiations. The first proposal, submitted by Czechoslovakia, Ireland, Spain, and Sweden, reads as follows:</p>
<p>The General Assembly, in view of the conclusions of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry, which state that various possible methods of peaceful resolution prior to September 18, 1931, were not adopted, and also state that the relationship between China and Japan is a relationship of disguised warfare, and also state that after September 18, 1931, the military actions of the Japanese army cannot be regarded as legitimate self-defense;</p>
<p>The General Assembly, in view of the report of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry, states that without a declaration of war, a part of Chinese territory has been seized by the Japanese army and declared independent from other parts of China;</p>
<p>The General Assembly, also in view of the conclusion of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry, states that the existing system in Manchuria cannot be regarded as a sincere and natural independence movement;</p>
<p>Therefore, the General Assembly recognizes that the large-scale military occupation after the September 18, 1931, incident cannot be regarded as a plan for legitimate self-defense;</p>
<p>The General Assembly also recognizes that the system currently established within Manchuria can only be implemented by relying on the presence of Japanese troops in the territory, and also recognizes that the recognition of the existing system in Manchuria is not in accordance with existing international obligations;</p>
<p>The General Assembly now authorizes the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee to cooperate with the governments of the United States and Russia in order to negotiate with both parties to seek a method of resolving this dispute based on the above conclusions;</p>
<h3>The Second Proposal is in the Names of Switzerland and Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>Submitted by, reads as follows:</p>
<p>The General Assembly has received the report of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry and the written opinions of both parties, as well as the minutes of the Executive Yuan's meetings from November 21 to November 28 of this year, and in view of the discussions of the General Assembly, it now requests the Special Committee (Nineteen-Nation Special Committee) elected in accordance with the General Assembly Resolution of March 11, 1932, to</p>
<p>(1) Study the opinions expressed and the suggestions put forward in the General Assembly's discussions, and study the draft resolutions submitted to the General Assembly;</p>
<p>(2) Draft proposals in order to resolve the dispute raised in accordance with the Executive Yuan Resolution of February 19, 1932;</p>
<p>(3) Submit this proposal to the General Assembly in the shortest possible time. (Reuters dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Japanese Delegation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Ito, the official spokesperson for the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations, issued the following statement to the press: "We are very surprised by the draft resolution submitted by the representatives of Spain, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, and Sweden. In my opinion, the sole purpose of this draft resolution is to insult and scold Japan. Japan is now striving to explain its position. The representatives of Britain, France, and various other countries, large and small, are now suggesting mediation. The draft resolution is actually being submitted to the General Assembly at this time, which should at least be considered unfair. The Japanese delegation firmly believes that it is close to the path of mediation, but this draft resolution runs counter to it. Most of the representatives of the Extraordinary General Assembly have successively delivered speeches, focusing on mediation. Now, four of these representatives suddenly submit this draft resolution, and receive support from the entire venue or a large part of the venue. We cannot help but question whether the people who expressed their opinions are sincere." (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Issue of US and Russian Participation</h3>
<p>Simon Consults Closely with Representatives of Both Countries</p>
<p>Before the Authority and Scope are Defined</p>
<p>The Japanese Government Will Not Express Its Attitude for the Time Being</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Simon secretly contacted the representatives of the United States and Russia yesterday before speaking at the General Assembly. It is said that both representatives replied to Simon that if the League of Nations General Assembly resolves to hold a 21-nation conference and invites the two countries to participate, the two countries will definitely not decline. (China United Press dispatch from the 8th) (Geneva) It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Simon first obtained a guarantee that the move to invite the United States and Russia to participate in the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee would not be unwelcome. Therefore, Simon officially proposed the invitation. This matter must wait until after the General Assembly votes before it can proceed. At that time, the Chairman of the General Assembly will formally contact both parties. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th) (Tokyo) There is a rather cold attitude here towards British Foreign Secretary Simon's advocacy of the United States and Russia joining the Conciliation Committee. The government has not yet made a specific statement. Tonight, the spokesperson for the Japanese government said that before the United States and Russia clarify their attitudes on this issue, and before the authority and scope of the Conciliation Committee are determined, the Japanese government will temporarily not express its opinion on this matter. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Foreign Secretary Simon proposed the organization of a 21-nation committee at the League of Nations General Assembly on the 7th to mediate the Sino-Japanese problem, and the atmosphere at the General Assembly is quite conducive to this goal. Upon receiving this news, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened a meeting of relevant personnel on the morning of the 8th to coordinate countermeasures. As a result, a policy was decided: unless the tasks, powers, and scope of the committee are clearly known in advance, no approval can be expressed. Moreover, if any of the following three principles are violated, Japan will absolutely oppose its organization: (1) The participation of representatives from the countries concerned is absolutely necessary for the organization of a committee to resolve the Manchurian problem. Japan excludes third-country interference in this problem. (2) The Manchurian problem should be reviewed by the Council. Transferring it to the Conciliation Committee violates the original mission of the League of Nations. (3) The resolution of the Manchurian problem requires the fact that Japan recognizes "Manchukuo" as a necessary condition. (United Press dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's opinion on the Conciliation Committee is that if it does not conflict with the established policy of recognizing "Manchukuo," it will not oppose it. However, regarding the composition of the committee, its intentions are as follows: (1) If the 21-nation committee does not include China and Japan, its appearance will be like a forced arbitration body, which violates the spirit of coordination in the League of Nations Covenant. (1) If the United States and Russia participate in the committee, then the actual "Manchukuo" should also be added, or it will request that China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" participate in the committee. (Telecommunications Agency dispatch from the 8th) The United States Prepares</p>
<h3>To Cooperate With the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Washington) Washington paid close attention to the news that the four small countries had submitted a proposal in Geneva to invite the United States and the Soviet Union to participate in the Nineteen-Nation Committee meeting. It is reported that government officials held a long meeting at the State Department today regarding the path the United States should take once it receives the invitation. According to current indications, if the League of Nations can first accept the Lytton Report and then extend the invitation, it will be easier for the United States to accept it because the United States recognizes the Lytton Report as a purely League of Nations affair. (National News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon's Speech</p>
<h3>Insufficient Understanding of the Sino-Japanese Case</h3>
<p>Attempting to Shed Responsibility for the League of Nations</p>
<p>Promoting Direct Negotiations Between China and Japan</p>
<p>Especially Pointing Out the Chapter on Goods Boycott in the Report</p>
<p>Implicitly Indicating That China Should Bear Responsibility for the Remote Causes of the Incident</p>
<p>Simon spoke at the General Assembly on the afternoon of the 7th, saying that one of the greatest services of the Lytton Report was to reveal the complex nature of the Manchurian problem. This is not a case where one country first tried various mediation opportunities stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant without success and then declared war on another country, nor is it a simple case where one country invades the borders of a neighboring country with force. The Manchurian problem has many unique features that are incomparable to other places in the world. The Lytton Report does not make one-sided statements but makes appropriate criticisms of both China and Japan. If the Lytton Report did not contain depictions of the terrible conditions in Manchuria and objective records of the anti-Japanese boycott, the content of the report could not be said to be fair.</p>
<h3>Not Wanting to be a Referee, the Czech Foreign Minister First Won My Heart</h3>
<p>Czech representative Beneš once said that he did not want to be a referee for any party. These words really won my heart. Apart from special events, one important thing to note is that the League of Nations method has not been used. We are members of the League of Nations, so it is our responsibility,</p>
<h3>Restoring the Original State of the Eastern Provinces is Impossible, According to the British Representative</h3>
<p>In safeguarding the League of Nations Covenant and making the League of Nations method usable to the greatest possible extent in the future, our first concern is that the League of Nations can use its power to improve the existing situation, and the serious consequences of the League of Nations not using this power, which will affect the future. The current conflict between China and Japan arose because of the situation before September of last year, and now wanting to restore the original state will only lead to a recurrence of disasters. This is merely starting from ideals and ignoring the actual things in the situation.</p>
<h3>Resolving the Sino-Japanese Dispute Should Focus on Reality, Not Ideals</h3>
<p>Therefore, we should focus on reality. Neither side has fully accepted this report, and both sides have made concessions. We have no other way but to proceed based on the history and facts contained in the first part of the report and its conclusions. We must protect the principles of the League of Nations and promote reconciliation. If there is hope for good results from direct negotiations, we should encourage them in every way possible within our power. However, the League of Nations can also assist in this reconciliation work.</p>
<h3>Advocating US and Russian Participation Can Make the Effectiveness of Handling Matters More Sufficient</h3>
<p>If a way can be found to have representatives from the United States and Russia join the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee, the effectiveness of the Special Committee in handling this matter can be even more sufficient. Simon, when he got to this point, recounted Matsuoka's remarks to the Executive Yuan, saying that Japan has always been a good and faithful member of the League of Nations and is willing to do everything in its power to maintain this attitude. I represent the member states of the League of Nations throughout history. There is absolutely no difference between small and large countries on this point.</p>
<h3>Recognizing the Covenant as the Constitution, How Can One Country Freely Discard It?</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Covenant is our constitution, and we cannot freely discard it. We are responsible for maintaining it. We must first find a practical solution. If the League of Nations handles it carefully and appropriately and promotes a solution, it can be of great help. Britain is willing to work with other member states, including China and Japan, to the best of its ability to find a solution that is fair and suitable for all parties' interests, end the current conflict, and eliminate the possibility of future conflicts.</p>
<h3>Quoting Lincoln's Famous Saying to Encourage Each Other to Strive for Peace</h3>
<p>Simon concluded his remarks this morning by quoting a section of Lincoln's inaugural address at the second Congress. Lincoln said, "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to achieve a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations." (Reuters dispatch from the 7th) (Geneva) On the 7th, representatives of major powers spoke. The remarks of the British representative were somewhat biased. All points in the Lytton Report that were unfavorable to us, such as the boycott of goods and xenophobia, were stated, while points unfavorable to Japan were not mentioned at all. What is particularly noteworthy is that the British representative quoted the Lytton Report as saying that "restoring the state before September 18th is impossible," but the sentence in which Lytton said that maintaining the current puppet state is also inappropriate was not mentioned at all. The general opinion here is that they are all deeply shocked. (Central Telegram from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Comments from the British Press</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph criticized the debate in Geneva on the Sino-Japanese problem, hoping that the British Foreign Secretary Simon's proposal to hand over the work of resolving this problem to the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee, and inviting representatives from the United States and Russia to participate, would be approved by all parties in Geneva and the governments of the United States and Russia. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th) (London) Today, The Times criticized Foreign Secretary Simon's speech at the League of Nations General Assembly in Geneva yesterday, saying that this was a beneficial compromise for spicy remarks. Japan did not consult with the League of Nations before acting in Manchuria. Now that the League of Nations has heard impolite discussions, it should not mind. The Lytton Report shows that if any party no longer aggravates the situation with violent behavior, then a solution must be sought through conciliation. Now that this issue has been handed over to the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee, it can indeed be dismissed as procrastination, but the Manchurian case dispute is indeed a problem where patience is the first condition for a peaceful solution. The announcement of the establishment of "Manchukuo" hindered the immediate implementation of the policies contained in the Lytton Report, but what Japan was prepared to accept a year ago, Japan may be prepared to accept again in a year or two. The current nationalist and militarist sentiments in Japan will eventually have a reaction. The work of the League of Nations is to reconcile the exaggerated independence movement represented by the new state with the permanent interests of the residents of Manchuria. It is now useless to hope that the country will make a dramatic gesture, because the excellent policies proposed by the League of Nations depend on the willingness of each country to implement them. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th) Speech by the German Foreign Minister</p>
<h3>There Are Other Implications Regarding Military Equality</h3>
<p>German representative Neurath stated that the Sino-Japanese conflict has a special relationship with Germany because Germany is a country that has disarmed. In its work with the League of Nations, it pays special attention to systems that can prevent the use of force and promote peaceful solutions. The Sino-Japanese conflict is a testament to this theory. The experience of the past year has revealed to the world the great difficulty that if military means are realized in the conflict for one day, the League of Nations' orders cannot be executed. The German representative emphasized the special nature of the Sino-Japanese conflict, saying that conflicts of political, economic, and social interests have created a dispute in Manchuria that cannot be supported by complex agreements governing the relations between the two parties. Therefore, the League of Nations should limit itself to dealing with this matter with abstract principles, but it must establish a constructive plan that can both seek an effective solution and prevent the recurrence of future conflicts. The League of Nations must take into account the necessary strength of the nation and its natural trend of development, and must never ignore the natural evolution found in Manchuria in the past decade. At the same time, the League of Nations must guide this development along peaceful paths so that the application of force can be effectively abolished. This does not mean creating a new judicial system, but only means that the governments of the countries concerned should gather under the principles of the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. All member states of the League of Nations have the same relationship and want the establishment of good relations between China and Japan. The German representative finally indirectly touched on Germany's request for equal status in Geneva, saying that in addition to the Sino-Japanese conflict, there is another issue that concerns the whole world. This matter will not be discussed in the General Assembly, but the study of the Sino-Japanese conflict naturally makes the General Assembly have to consider general events. In other words, if the General Assembly wants to achieve a fair solution without military intervention, it must make all countries have equal military strength. This condition is crucial. Without it, all judicial procedures will eventually be questionable.</p>
<h3>The Italian Representative's Speech Emphasizes Practicality</h3>
<p>Peace in the Far East is Based on International Cooperation</p>
<p>The Lytton Recommendation Should be Seen as the Starting Point for a Solution</p>
<p>Italian representative Aloisi spoke, emphasizing the need to seek a solution based on reality, saying that the representatives here are not establishing ideal principles, but want to find a just and practical solution. The solution proposed in the Lytton Report is extremely compatible with the League of Nations' established basic concept of seeking a solution between China and Japan. The debates in the Executive Yuan and the General Assembly have not shown that the measures proposed in the Lytton Report are impossible to implement. All sections described in detail in the report should be considered as a whole. The conclusions of the Lytton Commission should be regarded as the basis for the solution. Both China and Japan have not refused to start negotiations, so the General Assembly can consider using this method to find a solution. In the work of mediation, the recommendations of the Lytton Report should be regarded as the starting point for the solution, rather than fixed and unchangeable rules. If a solution is sought based on the Lytton Report, the future international situation in Manchuria should only be considered when Sino-Japanese harmony is restored. The Lytton Report suggests that the great powers should assist China in restoring stability, which should be followed. Peace in the Far East will be the result of long-term construction work. He hopes that this work will begin on two foundations, namely the Sino-Japanese solution and the cooperation of the great powers with China. The Lytton Commission of Inquiry is the first tool of international cooperation. They are currently in a situation where they may also form a League of Nations body to handle this matter. He believes that the simplest solution is to transform the Lytton Commission of Inquiry into a body to handle this matter, but in order to distinguish between the two bodies, other methods can also be considered. Italy does not object to this, because it does not change the fundamental concept of the international nature of the new committee in the future. (Reuters dispatch from the 7th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Simon's Speech at the League of Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>We Chinese have long known about the League of Nations' inability to judge the merits of the Sino-Japanese problem. Those who still abandon their dependence on the League of Nations today are those who, in previous meetings, still had representatives from major powers who spoke out for justice, expressing many correct opinions in the venue. It was difficult to obtain a satisfactory solution, and the anger of our people was not slightly calmed because of this. The situation at this League of Nations meeting is becoming increasingly unfavorable. Apart from the representatives of various small countries, who can still uphold fairness and justice, and unanimously refuse to recognize the puppet Manchukuo, the four major powers of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany mostly advocate promoting Sino-Japanese reconciliation and are unwilling to clearly judge right and wrong. What is particularly unsatisfying to us is the speech delivered by Sir Simon at the afternoon meeting on the 7th.</p>
<p>His first point was: "The Manchurian problem cannot be compared to a simple case of one country invading a neighboring country with force because it has many unique features." However, in our opinion, this Sino-Japanese negotiation is indeed a simple case of a certain country raising troops to invade another country by force, without a doubt. Everyone knows that the September 18th Incident was caused by Japan, which harbored wild ambitions for肆 行 invasion. The evidence is conclusive, and even the League of Nations' Lytton Report admits it. As for the various disputes involved, they were all brewed by Japan to achieve its goal of invading Manchuria. The so-called characteristics of Sir Simon, in our view, can all be attributed to the result of the Japanese act of aggression. This is what we deeply do not understand.</p>
<p>The second point was: "The current Sino-Japanese conflict arose because of the situation before September of last year, and now wanting to restore the original state would only lead to a recurrence of disasters. This is because it is starting from ideals and ignoring the actual things in the situation. Therefore, we should focus on the facts." This statement is even more shocking. May I ask, why was the safe situation before September 18th destroyed? The Japanese wanted to annex our three northeastern provinces, so they first stirred up local unrest in various ways, and then used force to forcibly occupy their land. Therefore, the destruction of the original situation was the destruction by the Japanese. Then, today, to resolve this problem, we only need to first order Japan to withdraw its troops in order to restore the original situation as the primary meaning. If it is feared that after restoring the original state, it may cause trouble again, it is to admit that Japan's military force is fearsome, and that the League of Nations cannot contain it. Is the face of the League of Nations not already completely peeled off? How can the weak countries that advocate peace not be chilled by this?</p>
<p>The third point was: "If there is hope for good results from direct negotiations, we should encourage them in every way possible within our power." This is no less than supporting Japan's claims. It is even more than expressing that the League of Nations is unable to resolve it and pushing this case out the door. Japan has repeatedly chanted that the Sino-Japanese problem does not allow interference from third parties and does not allow the League of Nations to deliberate. On the one hand, it is using various arguments to induce our direct negotiations. Direct negotiations are exactly what they have been dreaming of and have not yet fulfilled. The reason why they are inducing our direct negotiations is that they are still afraid that the League of Nations can advocate justice, fairness, and compliance with various conventions and covenants. The reason why our country trusts the League of Nations is also that the League of Nations can still advocate fairness, justice, and compliance with conventions and covenants. Now, if we shirk responsibility and ignore it, and assist in the direct negotiations sought by the Japanese, then why should we ask the League of Nations and rely on the League of Nations?</p>
<p>Britain, as a member that initiated the organization of the League of Nations, sincerely supported the covenant. The words are still in my ears. The relationship between China and Britain is also called harmonious. It should uphold fairness and not be biased. This is not for the sake of private relationships between countries. It is also the maintenance of the League of Nations' dignity that should be. If we blindly follow the intentions of the strong, then all conventions and covenants will truly be equal to waste paper. Sir Simon's speech cannot but be recognized as insufficient understanding, and makes us remember the former representative Cecil, who was able to barely satisfy the people's hopes. The British government should, for the sake of world peace, correct its errors.</p>

<p>Taking the Preservation of the Covenant as Their Responsibility</p>
<p>The Solo Delegate's Tone Approached Defending Japan</p>
<h3>The Meeting on the Afternoon of the 7th</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Sino-Japanese problem has taken on a new aspect today. The smaller countries have proposed two motions requesting the League of Nations General Assembly to denounce Japan's violation of treaties. They are seeking the assistance of the American and Russian representatives to discuss mediation methods. The League of Nations General Assembly is now approaching the stage of adopting important measures to resolve the dispute. It is expected that the General Assembly will seriously propose a motion to refuse recognition of "Manchukuo" but stipulate mediation procedures. British Foreign Secretary Simon gave a lengthy speech today, suggesting that the United States and Russia should each undertake mediation work for the Nineteen-Member Committee. German Foreign Minister Neurath also agreed with this proposal. Today's afternoon meeting lasted for three hours, ending at 6:40 PM. Chairman Hymans hoped that the general debate would conclude tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>(The Hague) Delegate Moltesco, speaking through the Spanish representative on the afternoon of the 7th, stated that the Dutch government</p>
<p>agrees with the previous</p>
<p>speakers' opinions regarding the Lytton Report, but he would rather not make any judgments. He declared that we are still within the scope of Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant and must strive for reconciliation. He supports Sir John Simon's suggestion to invite the United States and Russia to participate in the Nineteen-Member Committee. He also advocated that all major powers with consulates in Manchuria</p>
<p>should be asked to submit reports on the Manchurian situation to the League of Nations. The major powers each declared that they would never recognize "Manchukuo." (Reuter's dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Denmark) Delegate Borg stated that the value of the League of Nations Covenant</p>
<p>hinges on the method of interpreting its meaning.</p>
<p>He argued that the Sino-Japanese conflict should be resolved in a way that reflects the basic principles of the League of Nations Covenant. Borg strongly urged China and Japan not to destroy the chain that binds all countries together, which is the League of Nations Covenant. (Reuter's dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The Meeting on the Morning of the 8th</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Assembly convened at 10:45 this morning.</p>
<p>(Turkey) Delegate Husni spoke first,</p>
<p>stating that the Turkish people have always had</p>
<p>a very deep friendship with China and Japan and have given them very sincere sympathy. He deeply regretted the conflict between the two countries. He will now explain Turkey's attitude towards the Covenant and towards the issue of peace. Today, the world is suffering from instability. If unexpected events can overturn regulations at any time, what is the point of convening meetings to resolve debt and other issues? There are areas of the current situation that must be changed for the sake of peace, but these changes, after thorough consideration, should be made in an atmosphere of tranquility and peace. Therefore, the League of Nations Assembly should firmly and clearly determine its adherence to the League of Nations Covenant in the future. He believes that this attitude of the Assembly can alleviate the common anxieties of various countries arising from unemployment and industrial stagnation. If the Assembly, in the spirit of the Covenant, can unanimously express opposition to any action that may undermine peace, then this attitude will surely give the world a sense of peace, and even countries that have suffered some sacrifices due to the initial use of the Covenant can benefit from the guarantee of peace. Any conflict that is sufficient to disturb world peace should simultaneously trigger the actions of the League of Nations Covenant and the Pact of Paris. Therefore, he feels that the Assembly should initiate an invitation to countries that are not members of the League of Nations but are signatories to the Pact of Paris to present their views and share responsibility. The Lytton Report, while analyzing the complexity of the problem, does not neglect the realities of the situation. This document has facilitated the work of the Assembly. The Assembly should, as early as possible, find a way to stop the current conflict in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant. He believes that there are still grounds for applying mediation procedures consistent with Article 15, Paragraph 3. He hopes that this negotiation can achieve a solution that truly satisfies the interests of both parties.</p>
<p>(Mexico) Delegate Pani stated that he</p>
<p>believes that the existence of the League of Nations</p>
<p>depends on the handling of the Sino-Japanese problem. He, representing Mexico, declared that the country is determined to uphold peace and justice in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>Mr. Pani's speech was the shortest, lasting only two minutes.</p>
<p>Japanese delegate Matsuoka spoke, his words startling the audience, saying that the draft resolutions submitted by the South African Republic, Spain, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden, which condemn Japan, are not only inconsistent with the conclusions of the Lytton Report but also inconsistent with the principles of the League of Nations. Therefore, he requested that these resolutions be withdrawn, or they should be put to a vote, so that Japan can know the feelings of the Assembly. If this resolution is passed, it will have consequences that the proposers did not anticipate. After Matsuoka finished speaking, the representatives of the signatory countries of the proposal immediately withdrew to have private consultations.</p>
<p>Chairman Hymans rose and stated that the discussion should continue and that the documents submitted by Matsuoka need to be considered by the Chairman personally and the Japanese representative. Hymans then invited the Polish representative to speak.</p>
<p>(Poland) Delegate Cielecki stated that the Sino-Japanese</p>
<p>dispute presented in the Lytton</p>
<p>Report is extremely complex. The nature of the conflict</p>
<p>is different from ordinary disputes and not entirely the same as armed conflict. Poland has the same respect for China and Japan and is willing to do its best to assist the League of Nations in finding a solution. The recommendations of the Lytton Report should be given careful consideration. Any resolution that has not been fully studied may cause great difficulties. He believes that the most appropriate method for seeking a solution is mediation.</p>
<p>(Canada) Delegate Cairine Wilson stated that Canada</p>
<p>has good intentions towards both China and Japan.</p>
<p>Neither country can be fully judged according to Western standards. The fact that both Chinese and Japanese representatives are present before the League of Nations Assembly shows the strength of the League of Nations, so there is no need to worry too much. He is not without doubt as to whether the Chinese government is sufficiently strong. Canada, as part of the British Empire, also signed the Nine-Power Treaty. He believes that the government's hope in the Nine-Power Treaty is that it does not seek to reduce Japan's treaty rights in China. Any attempt by China to abolish Japan's treaty rights would be a serious violation of international justice. Cairine Wilson then cited former British Foreign Secretary Chamberlain's words regarding the anti-British movement in China and cited a communication from Great Britain to the League of Nations on January 8, 1927. Subsequently, Japan could submit a similar document to the League of Nations in 1931 regarding the boycott of Japanese goods, but even if Japan did so, it would not be a reason for Japan to permanently occupy Chinese territory. Canada moved to delete Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant in 1910. In his opinion, the Assembly should not ignore Matsuoka's statement that the Japanese were not involved in the Manchurian independence movement. All mediation methods must be tried and should not be restricted. Even if the Assembly does not act on each of the articles in the Lytton Report, it may well accept the conclusions of the investigation team as the basis for the Assembly's actions. He advocated establishing a permanent mixed international committee, in which China and Japan could also participate. He hoped that this group could devise a solution acceptable to Japan. If Japan is prepared to seek a peaceful agreement, then no obstacles should be placed in its path. If Japan is not prepared to seek a peaceful solution, then repeated delays will be most unfortunate.</p>
<p>(Panama) Delegate Garaiz stated that the content of the Lytton</p>
<p>Report has appropriately</p>
<p>determined Panama's view on the Sino-Japanese</p>
<p>dispute. He advocates seeking a common ground for agreement based on the League of Nations members' support for the Covenant. The Lytton Report has provided a starting point for the special committee to mediate.</p>
<p>(Chile) Delegate Saavedra stated that</p>
<p>he hopes that the League of Nations will seek a peaceful</p>
<p>solution in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant. He believes that coercive measures should not be used except as a last resort. If they must be used, they must be exercised with the utmost caution. He supports inviting the United States and Russia to cooperate with the Nineteen-Member Committee.</p>
<p>(Romania) Delegate Antoniade</p>
<p>stated that Romania believes that any</p>
<p>solution must</p>
<p>be based on the League of Nations Covenant and the Pact of Paris. The Lytton Commission's work has been excellent, and the Assembly should seek a solution based on its recommendations. He hopes that the future solution can both guarantee world peace and preserve the dignity of both parties to the dispute.</p>
<p>(Hungary) Delegate Thanoss stated that Hungary</p>
<p>is willing to do its utmost to cooperate</p>
<p>with any method that the Assembly can devise to resolve</p>
<p>the dispute.</p>
<p>(Australia) Delegate Bruce stated that Australia has very good relations with both China and Japan. This conflict contains the possibility of a Far Eastern war and the possibility of a worldwide war. Australia upholds all the principles of the League of Nations. The only way for the League of Nations is to work on the present situation. The principles of the League of Nations must be maintained, and the solution must be in accordance with the Covenant. The Lytton Report reveals the facts of this issue without taking sides. He hopes that the Assembly will not pass resolutions that are openly or implicitly condemning, otherwise the work of mediation will be extremely difficult. He believes that a prudent approach is to establish the suggestion of British Foreign Secretary Simon, inviting the representatives of the United States and Russia to join the mediation committee.</p>
<p>After Bruce finished speaking, the Assembly adjourned. The time was 12:50 PM. The afternoon meeting was scheduled to begin at 3:30 PM. After the Assembly adjourned, the representatives of the various small countries gathered to discuss the situation caused by the request of Japanese representative Matsuoka. They all believed that Matsuoka's request was not in accordance with the rules of procedure. According to the meeting procedure, all motions must be submitted to the Nineteen-Member Committee. If Matsuoka requests a vote on a procedural issue, then this vote must have a majority of one-fourth, which the Japanese representative may not be able to obtain. The various small countries decided to discuss it further in the afternoon.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon met with the Chinese representative for over half an hour after the morning session adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Meeting on the Afternoon of the 8th</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The afternoon meeting began at 3:55 PM, 25 minutes later than scheduled.</p>
<h3>Colombia</h3>
<p>Delegate Camacho spoke first, stating that Colombia is prepared to support any solution within the scope of the League of Nations Covenant. Colombia has always based its foreign policy on the principles of the League of Nations. Colombia is prepared to cooperate with any possible mediation plan. (Reuter's dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Su Bingwen Stops Going to Geneva</p>
<h3>Will Return Home Via Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Accompanying Officers and Civilians Decide to Return Home in Three Routes</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Cables Wang Tseng-ssu to Handle Escort Negotiations</p>
<p>Japanese Side Widely Rumors that Russia Agreed to Extradite Su and His Entourage</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen telegraphed Beiping, reporting that he is now in Bolshaya Ussurka and will stop going to Geneva due to lack of funds and will return home via Vladivostok. According to a certain important person, Su's troops were originally a provincial defense force with a smaller establishment of about 2,000 men. Because many anti-Japanese soldiers joined, there were more than 4,000 men. This time, it is extremely difficult to provide supplies and national travel expenses for those who retreated to Russia. Su is directly negotiating with Moscow on this matter. Unless there is a resettlement plan, Mr. Su himself will not be able to return home first. All the rumors circulating are not true. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) General Su Bingwen, loyal and brave in resisting Japan, telegraphed the government after leading his troops into Russian territory, requesting negotiations with Soviet Russia for an escort back to the country. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered Wang Tseng-ssu to negotiate with the Russian government. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Su Bingwen retreated into Russian territory, more than 4,000 accompanying officers, family members, and civilians decided to return to the country in one of three routes. One group will take a ship from Vladivostok, one group will come to Beiping via Outer Mongolia, and one group will get off the train in a certain place in Siberia and go to Tacheng to take a Eurasia plane back to Beiping. It is expected that they will all gather in Beiping in January next year. A certain prominent figure in Beiping has telegraphed the National Government and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that they find a way to transport and assist them. It has not yet been determined whether Su will travel with these three groups or take another route to Europe to return to the country. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Manzhouli, after Su Bingwen led his troops by train from Hailar on the evening of the 3rd, Commander Gui Fu, who had a very good relationship with Su, went to the station to see him off, crying uncontrollably. Su also wept, the scene was extremely tragic. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Important military officers, family members of Su Bingwen's troops, and Su's wife left Hailar for Vladivostok on the 1st. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Widely Rumors that Russian Military Agreed to Japanese Military's Request to Extradite Anti-Japanese Generals</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Toho News, the Russian government agreed to the Japanese military's request and handed over 47 anti-Japanese generals, including Su Bingwen, Zhang Dianjiu, Wu Delin, and Ma Zhanshan, to the Japanese military last night. The Japanese military has transferred them to Qiqihar. However, the Russian embassy denied this, saying that it had not received any such news. The Japanese Ministry of the Army also has not received this official telegram. A certain important person in the Ministry of the Army said that the Japanese military had requested Russia to hand over the anti-Japanese generals. As for the Russian agreement to hand them over, there has been no official telegram. If Russia agrees to hand them over, the Japanese military will accuse them of insulting the imperial army and killing Japanese residents and will hand them over to a military court for extreme punishment. (China United Press dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Lieutenant General Okamura, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, flew to Qiqihar this morning, then transferred to Manzhouli to discuss the transfer of anti-Japanese generals with the Russian consul. According to the opinion of the military department, China and Japan have not yet declared war, and Russia may not agree to Japan's request. Since there is no declaration of war, the Soviet military's opposition to Manchukuo is an internal affair, and all countries have a responsibility to protect political prisoners. Russia has recently been trying to maintain peace and is unwilling to conflict with Japan, but the future of the transfer is difficult to realize. (China United Press dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Enters Hailar</h3>
<p>The Qiqihar Matsumoto Detachment Headquarters announced that the main force of the Hattori Detachment entered Hailar City at 2:00 AM on the 8th. (Dentsu dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Manzhouli Regain Freedom</h3>
<p>(Manzhouli) When the Miyamoto advance force entered Manzhouli City at 2:00 PM yesterday, they rushed to the consulate and discovered that the remaining Japanese people, including Consul Yamagata and Captain Ohara, who had been detained in the consulate since the incident on September 27, were still being held in the consulate. Captain Miyamoto and the remaining Japanese residents embraced each other. Consul Yamagata and others had been detained for 40 days, their hair and beards were full of dust, their faces were haggard, and some wept with joy. (Dentsu dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Did Not Go to Russia, Received Telegram in Beiping A Few Days Ago</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side claimed that Ma Zhanshan disguised himself as a coolie on the 4th and entered Russian territory with Su Bingwen, intending to go to Beiping via Xinjiang. According to a certain important person, Ma is still between Nehe and Buxi, in the Greater Khingan Mountains, and is uniting various units to continue resisting Japan. The Japanese side often sent planes to detect Ma's whereabouts, but all reports were negative. Therefore, they fabricated the news of Ma's entry into Russian territory to eliminate the anti-Japanese forces. In fact, Ma sent a telegram to Beiping on the 4th, reporting his whereabouts and asking people not to believe the Japanese propaganda tricks. (Special dispatch on the 8th) (Beiping) Ma Zhanshan's cavalry is still north of the Qiqihar-Koshun Railway. Ma is currently residing near Boketu, disguised as a peasant. There has been no telegram from Ma to Beiping in the past two days. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian government, after detailed investigation of the Japanese propaganda that General Ma Zhanshan also accompanied General Su Bingwen to enter Russian territory, has so far been unable to confirm it. As for the Northeastern refugees and those who have been relieved of their duties who have now entered Russian territory, there are already more than 4,000 people, including more than a dozen Chinese officials.

The content of the plan is to manufacture 90,000 tons of ammonium sulfate annually with a capital of 15 million yen, as a continuous project for two years. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs, with regard to the original plan of 180,000 tons for the South Manchuria Railway Company, considering the increase in demand and the rise in prices, is very willing for the South Manchuria Railway Company to actively expand, but due to funding reasons, it needs to wait for Vice President Hatta to come to Beijing to discuss further.

<h3>Tang Yulin Decides to Defend Rehe Firmly</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The situation on the Rehe border is tense again. After the military affairs in northern Manchuria end, Japan will launch an offensive against Rehe with Mongolian bandits and Chinese traitors. The Nanling, Chaoyangsi, and Fuxin areas have been particularly tense in recent days. Tang Yulin has sent Meng Zhaotian to inspect the front line and prepare for a solid defense.

<p>(Beiping) The Rehe border is tense, and Tang Yulin is determined to defend it to the death. He will request Song Ziwen and Zhang Xueliang to discuss a thorough solution for the financial situation in Rehe when the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is convened. (Special dispatch on the 8th) (Tokyo) According to telegrams received from Tokyo, military action may soon occur in the Rehe Province. On the 7th of this month, many members of the righteous army on the Fengshan Line engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese garrison troops in Shanhaiguan and Suizhong. As a result, the righteous army was defeated and retreated. It is now reported that the righteous army has concentrated in several locations on the Rehe border. Their weapons are quite well-equipped and include machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. In addition, engineering teams are repairing military roads, connecting various important locations. The righteous army in the area seems to be preparing for a long-term resistance and is determined to refuse to incorporate Rehe into "Manchukuo". According to Japanese sources, the Rehe righteous army is secretly commanded by a certain party. According to news from Shanhaiguan, Japanese aircraft bombed Changanbao northwest of Shanhaiguan twice yesterday, causing some damage to the area.

<p>Germany's Demand for Equal Military Preparedness</p>
<p>French New Proposal Has Concession Intent</p>
<h3>American Plan Also Has Hope for Implementation</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 7th: German newspapers believe that the new French plan contains at least a thread of hope for a preliminary agreement on the issue of equal military status. The new French plan stipulates that Germany and other countries that ease military preparedness should be in an equal position under an equal security system, which is one of the goals of the Disarmament Conference. It is widely believed that this new plan can be used as a basis for continued discussion, stating that the new plan contains a certain degree of recognition of Germany's demands, thus indicating that France is prepared to abandon its absolute disregard or rejection of Germany's demands. However, this morning's newspapers still largely harbor doubts about the final outcome of the Geneva talks. As for the American proposal to have the Disarmament Conference make a preliminary agreement and then adjourn for several years, the Germans do not approve of it because the disarmament agreement that can be drafted at this time is only nominally worthless. ▲ National News Agency, Geneva, 8th: Representatives of several European countries at the Disarmament Conference welcomed the plan proposed by American representative Davis to draft a disarmament treaty before Christmas. It is said that because the United States insists on paying this month's war debts, its attitude has suddenly changed. However, Davis still stated today that his plan has a good chance of being implemented. The first complete excerpt of the plan will be published in Washington newspapers tonight.</p>

After the meeting, the dignitaries claimed that the government had not yet made a decision on the war debt issue. Everything should depend on the outcome of tomorrow's talks, and it is not appropriate to speculate at this time for fear of being inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Paris, 7th: Prime Minister Herriot is scheduled to attend the Finance and Foreign Affairs Committees of the House of Representatives on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning to explain the war debt issue. The date for the House of Representatives to discuss the war debt issue is set for Saturday.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 8th: It is rumored that the French government cannot make a decision on the issue of paying the war debts due on November 15 as quickly as expected. There are now seven options, and it is unknown which one to choose. (1) Pay as scheduled (2) Pay with reservations (3) Pay with government bonds (4) Allocate this amount to the International Clearing Bank (5) Allocate this amount to the Bank of France (6) Refuse to pay (7) Hand over to the arbitration of the British government. The attitude of the British government will be noted by the French government. This matter is not only a question of whether and how France will pay, but also a question of France paying British debts and the Lausanne Agreement. Therefore, the content is complex. French and British cabinet members will meet here tomorrow to discuss it. French Prime Minister Herriot proposed that a thorough consideration should be made first before making a decision. Therefore, the debate on the issue in the French parliament will obviously be delayed. Britain Advises France to Pay the Installments</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 8th: According to reliable sources today, British Prime Minister MacDonald is now trying to persuade France to repay the war debts due to the United States this month.

MacDonald is currently residing in the British Embassy here due to a cold and is expected to delay his return to Britain. Today, the French Prime Minister visited the British Embassy and had a long talk with MacDonald.</p>

Therefore, he requested to disembark and take a train to Turkey. After consideration, the French authorities granted his request. Therefore, Trotsky, his wife, and four secretaries re-embarked and took a train to Ventimiglia this afternoon.</p>

<p>US President's Budget Report Shows Significant Cuts in Military and Administrative Expenses</p>
<h3>Unable to Reduce Taxes Due to Treasury Shortfall: Finance Minister Reports Solid Financial Foundation</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 7th: The US President's budget report was officially read in Congress today. It estimates that during the accounting year from 1933 to 1934, maintaining the US government and repaying a portion of the national debt will cost taxpayers a total of $4,100,800,000.</p>
<p>This budget amount is slightly higher than the budget report submitted by the president in the previous year, but it is $58 million less than the actual budget in the previous year. The reason is that all the supplementary budgets in the previous year were high, resulting in the government's revenue falling short of its expenditure and the treasury being in deficit.</p>
<h3>▲ Unable to Reduce Taxes</h3>
<p>The President had intended to repeal some of the taxes passed by the previous Congress, but in view of the current situation, it is no longer possible to reduce them. Even the special gasoline tax with an annual revenue of $13,700,000 and the special manufacturing tax with an annual revenue of $35,500,000 must be collected as before. Otherwise, the budget for the coming year will be in deficit by $34,700,000.</p>
<p>The expenses of various departments have been reduced, with only a few exceptions that have been slightly increased, such as the expenses of the US Consulate in China, which have been increased by $6,000 to prevent the domestic administrative staff from acting fraudulently abroad.</p>
<p>The largest expenditure in the budget is for the Veterans Affairs Agency, totaling $931,727,000, but the previous year it was $1,072,064,000.</p>
<h3>▲ Significant Reduction in Military Expenses</h3>
<p>The Navy's expenses are listed as $308,000,000, compared to $343,000,000 in the previous year. The Army is listed as $365,000,000, compared to $423,940,300 in the previous year. This number includes the administrative expenses of the Panama Canal Zone. If only used for military purposes, it is only $276,863,000. The Chief of Staff's proposed increase in troop expenses was not included because his plan was originally intended to be implemented after the financial situation improved slightly. The Navy's expenses are listed as $308,000,000, compared to $343,000,000 in the previous year, so some people believe that the Navy's expenses have been reduced too much because it still contains $53,000,000 for continuing the projects of the ships that have already been built. In addition, it is planned to build a new 10,000-ton cruiser in January 1934, and four destroyers will be built later. In addition, the Department of Agriculture's expenses are $175,671,000, the Department of Finance's expenses are $250,308,000, and the construction expenses of public works in Washington, D.C. are $4,025,933.</p>
<p>As for the actual expenditures of the various departments in the current year, it is not possible to calculate them accurately at this time. Therefore, this budget can only be compared with the budget of the previous year. However, given the current shortage of tax revenue, the general public expects that although the budget for the coming year has been greatly reduced, it may still be necessary to impose new taxes.</p>
<h3>Germany Amends the Constitution</h3>
<p>President of the Supreme Court Concurrently Serves as Vice President</p>
<p>Passed Second Reading by Congress</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 7th: Fighting broke out in the German Congress today because Communist Party members attacked President Hindenburg. A woman, hearing this, became very angry and started to argue loudly. The audience, thinking that the woman was meddling, also started to make things difficult for the woman. At this time, the uniformed members of the National Socialist Party rose up and took on the responsibility of maintaining order. Communist Party members, seeing this, also rose up to stop the actions of the National Socialist Party members. Fighting broke out between the two sides, and tables, chairs, ink bottles, telephones, and other items flew everywhere. Therefore, the Deputy Speaker immediately announced a recess. After half an hour, the meeting was resumed, and the situation began to ease. The most important bill passed by Congress today is that the President of the Supreme Court also serves as the National Vice President. When the President dies or is unable to perform his duties, the Vice President will act as President. After this bill was proposed, the National Political Party and its Communist Party were extremely opposed. The National Socialist Party's reason was that the Supreme Court is an independent judicial organ and did not want to concurrently serve as the chief executive, which would damage the independence of the judiciary and involve the President of the Supreme Court in the political whirlpool. However, the bill was finally passed the second reading, and the third reading is expected to be held tomorrow. This case is an amendment to the Constitution, so it requires a two-thirds majority of the members to approve it before it can be finally passed. In addition, the Clerical Center Party, the National Socialist Party, and the Social Democratic Party have proposed many motions, advocating the abolition of some of the provisions in the recently announced emergency orders, such as fixed wage rates, health insurance, and other relief issues, which will be discussed further on Friday. In addition, the National Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Social Democratic Party have also proposed an amnesty for political prisoners, which has been transferred to a special committee for review. The opinions of the various parties on this issue are only slightly different, so no difficulties are expected. After the various cases are completed, Congress may be adjourned indefinitely. When it will be reconvened will be decided by the Speaker or the Standing Committee.</p>

<p>▲ (Reuters, Berlin, 7th) This afternoon, during a parliamentary session, a fierce brawl erupted between National Socialist Party and Communist Party members after a Communist Party member harshly criticized President Hindenburg. Teacups, telephones, ashtrays, spittoons, and ink bottles flew through the air, creating a terrifying scene. Some spectators joined the fray and were apprehended by uniformed National Socialist Party members. Subsequently, fifty Communist Party members stormed upstairs and continued fighting. Several parliament members were injured by shards of the broken objects. After a while, the anger subsided, order was restored, and the debate resumed on the National Socialist Party's proposed bill, which stipulated that in the event of an accident or resignation of the President, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court should temporarily assume the presidential powers. The aim of the bill was to prevent power from falling into the hands of Chancellor Schleicher.</p>
<h3>▲ Fiscal Consolidation</h3>
<p>▲ (National News Agency, Washington, 7th) Treasury Secretary Mills, in his report accompanying the President's budget proposal submitted to Congress today, stated that although the US treasury has experienced deficits for the past two years, its foundation remains solid. The shortfall in tax revenue is due to the simultaneous decrease in private industrial and commercial income. Therefore, all government expenditures must be rigorously economized.</p>
<p>The treasury deficit is estimated to reach $1,146,000,000 by the end of this fiscal year, excluding the funds designated for debt repayment. Therefore, it will be impossible to reduce the national debt in the next year or two. Although the President's budget proposal includes funds for debt repayment, they will likely be diverted to temporary expenditures.</p>
<h3>▲ Weak Tax Revenue</h3>
<p>Tax revenues have been very weak in recent years. At the end of the 1932 fiscal year, total tax revenue was only half of the average tax revenue for the four years leading up to and including 1930. It is feared that tax revenue for this fiscal year will be $264,000,000 less than estimated on May 1st of this year. Conversely, government spending has only increased due to the growing number of relief programs. This is why the treasury has such a large deficit. He also stated that he strongly opposes any new plans by Congress to increase the budget further.</p>
<p>▲ (National News Agency, Washington, 7th) With the President's budget and policy reports delivered to Congress, both the Senate and the House of Representatives began working on the ten major appropriation bills today, preparing for discussion and voting. It is expected that, since this Congress is a lame-duck session, and a new government will be in place in three months, there will be no further partisan disputes, and the bills will be passed quickly.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Financial Ruin in Japan</h3>
<p>Exchange Rate Decline ············· Increasing Foreign Debt</p>
<p>The Japanese Government Also Recognizes This as a Major Future Problem</p>
<p>Japanese Correspondence: Since implementing its aggressive policies, Japan has been at its peak for a while, dominating East Asia. However, why are people across the country, from the powerful military to those who earn a living through sweat, all crying out that the nation is in dire straits? Where exactly is Japan's so-called national crisis? Is it the development of leftist ideology? Is it the inadequacy of military power? Is it the impact of the global economic panic, which has led to overproduction and caused domestic economic panic? Is it the incurable bankruptcy of the countryside? Although these issues are all current challenges for Japan and relate to its very survival, they are not fatal wounds unless they are all combined. Moreover, they are hidden beneath the surface of society and not very clear, especially to the slow-thinking and relatively simple-minded military authorities, who are even more dismissive of these problems. What they see first is the "Manchurian problem." Although Japan has swallowed it, is it really "a bomb," as former Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara said, that will soon explode in the belly of the Japanese Empire? Second, the United States is in opposition to Japan and irreconcilable. The Soviet Union is also not an ally of Japan and is fundamentally incompatible with it. They think day and night about how to control the eastward expansion of American financial power and how to prevent the invasion of "red influence" into Manchuria, but they cannot help but appease the Soviet Union so that it does not become Japan's primary enemy. They have prepared very carefully for all of this, especially for Su Bingwen and Zhang Dianjiu, who are entrenched in the Hulunbuir area, and have devised extremely vicious traps. It is feared that the Su and Zhang armies will find it difficult to resist Japan. Little do they know that the most difficult problems are not military or diplomatic but rather in Japan's own finances.</p>
<p>Since last autumn, Japan's industrial sector has been declining more and more, and the market has collapsed. This has shaken the very foundations of society from the inside out. Initially, the ruling authorities (such as the Inukai Cabinet and the military) thought that once they launched foreign military actions, acquired territory, and stirred up national enthusiasm, the mere financial difficulties could be covered up. Unfortunately, the reality is not so simple. Not only can military expenditures not be recovered quickly, but the market has also been made worse as a result. Therefore, at the beginning of the Inukai Cabinet, they implemented a ban on "gold exports." In other words, they wanted to adopt an inflationary policy. However, financial capitalists in Japan, and those with some modern knowledge, did not advocate for reckless abandonment, which would lead to a financial crisis. Even this could not alleviate his difficulties. The market prosperity he hoped for did not improve at all. By May and June of this year, raw silk prices had plummeted, and the industrial sector was almost bankrupt as a whole. Therefore, they took advantage of the US election to incite the market and implement inflationism. Raw silk prices then rose more than twofold. As a result, some people in the government even advocated reducing the value of the currency to 25 US cents per 100 yen in order to save Japan's declining economy.</p>
<p>Although this policy was opposed at the time and not implemented, the amount of inflation has reached over 80 million yen. At the same time, the cash reserves in the country have also been reduced to 120 million yen. Therefore, the exchange rate has declined even further. Recently, it has broken all previous records, with 100 yen being worth only 20 and one-eighth US dollars, and it is still falling. On the one hand, it is enough to stimulate the export of Japanese goods, but on the other hand, it threatens Japan's imports of American and Indian cotton. This may be a mutually offsetting transaction. The most difficult thing is Japan's foreign debt, which was originally denominated in US dollars, British pounds, or French francs. Calculated at the current exchange rate, the amount of debt will increase by one and a half times.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Bank of Japan, the total amount of Japan's foreign debt at the end of October this year is as follows (unit: 1,000 yen at par value):</p>
<p>National debt 1,398,297 Local debt 234,390 Bank debt 19,177 Company debt 459,323 Total 2,111,187 The above total is over 2.1 billion yen in foreign debt. The debt to France is not included because most of it was transferred to Japanese hands during the European War. About 500 million yen of these bonds are in Japanese hands and have been registered with the Bank of Japan. There are also 500 million yen of bonds that are in Japanese hands but have not been registered. Before the ban on gold exports last year, Mitsui and Mitsubishi made a large speculative profit by buying US dollars, earning tens of millions of dollars in the process. Now that the exchange rate is even lower, all wealthy capitalists are worried about the future of the Japanese yen. Capital always seeks safe havens. Their money will all flee overseas, which will make Japan even poorer. Needless to say, the industrial sector will stagnate, and the Japanese currency will become even less valuable. After the capital flees abroad, how will these foreign debts of over 2.1 billion yen be repaid?</p>
<p>Now, the Japanese government sees this major future problem. Therefore, the Minister of Finance advocates compulsory purchase of foreign currency bonds in the hands of Japanese people, and even wants to manage foreign trade (imitating post-revolutionary Russia). However, to buy foreign debt in the hands of Japanese people, a foreign currency evaluation committee must be established. Should it be based on the price at the time of issuance, the price before the ban on gold exports, or another appropriate conversion price, or the current price? It has not yet been decided. Whether the purchaser is the government, a local government, a bank, or the bond-issuing company itself is not discussed for now. The difficult thing is this huge sum of over 1 billion yen. At the same time, there is over 1 billion yen in the hands of foreigners. This is something he can do nothing about. Not to mention repaying the principal, even paying the interest is enough to bankrupt Japan's finances.</p>
<p>(Tokyo, December 3rd)</p>
<h3>The Sichuan War Erupts Again</h3>
<p>A Major Battle Between Renshou and Jingyan is Imminent</p>
<p>The Tian and Liu Armies Take an Antagonistic Stance</p>
<p>Chiang Cables Deng Xihou to Mediate Again</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the 24th Army abandoned the Luzhou, Xufu, and Fushun-Neijiang lines, the 21st Army has achieved its wishes, and the Sichuan provincial war has come to an end for the time being. Subsequently, a circular telegram from Deng Xihou, commander of the 28th Army, called for a ceasefire. A telegram from the middle and upper-level generals of the Deng, Tian, and Liu armies expressed their support. Tian Songyao, Liu Wenhui, Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, and others also responded with telegrams. In addition, the central government issued a clear order to cease hostilities. Zhang Qun presented his opinions in an elegant telegram. Chairman Chiang also cabled Deng Xihou on the 29th of last month, tasking him with mediation. Telegrams and letters flew back and forth, and peace seemed promising. The people of Sichuan, after the disaster, craned their necks in the hopes of respite. Unexpectedly, after only a few days of ceasefire, all parties continued to engage in maneuvering as before, continued to mobilize troops and raise funds as before, and ignored the central government's orders as before. Contact has recently been reported between Renshou and Jingyan. Liu Xiang's office in Xixi received a Sichuan telegram on the 7th stating that the 21st Army, with nine brigades, was attacking Renshou and Jingyan, and had made contact with the 24th Army on the 4th. A major battle is expected on this route in the coming days. Tian Songyao's forces are pressing towards the provincial capital. Liu Wenhui's forces are constructing fortifications in the eastern gate area outside Chengdu, attempting to defend it. Currently, Liu Zhaogan is serving as the vanguard, opening up the eastern route. Yang Sen, Li Jiayu, and Luo Zezhou's forces are following behind. Chen Shunong's division, with the guarantee of Tian and Deng, is willing to move from Jianyang to the Suining area to facilitate the passage of the coalition forces. Deng Xihou also has a tendency to join the Tian army, and so on. Although there is no lack of Liu Xiang making a show of force, the recurrence of the war, which may tend to expand, can no longer be denied. It is understood that this Sichuan war is mainly between the two Lius, but the initiator is Li and Luo, the conductor is Liu Xiang, and the instigator seems to be Tian Songyao. Only Deng Xihou and Liu Cunhou have not yet joined the vortex. Liu is an experienced general in Sichuan, with the weakest strength, and does not want to have bad feelings with any party. Deng has the closest private relationship with Wenhui, but he is dissatisfied with his arrogance. Therefore, he initially watched his setbacks, and then maintained his position. The circular telegram was issued when Luzhou was captured, which is an expression of this inner feeling. Therefore, these two will never be used by Liu Xiang. Tian Songyao still seems to be taking an antagonistic stance against Liu Wenhui, but Tian's failure in the Chengdu conflict is only enough to support Liu Xiang. In terms of recent trends, it will still be a direct war between the two Lius. It is not yet the time for Deng, Tian, Liu, Yang, etc. to join the competition. As for Deng's mediation in accordance with Chiang's telegram, it was unsuccessful because Liu Xiang did not reply. He has replied to Chiang with a telegram on the mediation. Chiang cabled Deng again the day before yesterday, ordering him to continue to be responsible for mediation. Deng expressed that he will not slacken from beginning to end, but the two Lius have already implemented contact warfare and the battle is in full swing. It is feared that empty words will not be effective. (December 7th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Cables All Provinces to Strictly Prohibit Opium Poppy Planting</h3>
<p>Party, Government, Military Service Personnel, and Students</p>
<p>Measures for Quitting Smoking Reported to the National Government for Record</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang, in order to vigorously enforce the ban on opium, formulated the "Measures for Dispatching Personnel to Investigate and Prohibit Opium Poppy Planting in Ten Provinces." On the day of this month, he cabled the governments of Su, Zhe, Wan, E, Xiang, Yu, Gan, Min, Shan, and Gan provinces to comply with the measures. At this moment, with the Winter Solstice approaching, which is the time for planting poppy seeds, he feared that the measures would not be implemented effectively and that the ban would be delayed. On the 7th, he re-cabled the chairmen of the ten provinces, as well as the pacification commissioners of Fuzhou, Kaifeng, Xi'an, and Hankou, and the army commanders, reiterating the previous order and ordering the provincial governments to first dispatch personnel to investigate, combining punishment and persuasion, to ensure that the seeds do not enter the soil. In addition, the "Measures for Party, Government, Military Service Personnel, and Students to Quit Smoking Within a Time Limit," which were promulgated earlier, have been quite effective since their implementation. On the 7th, he specially reported these measures to the National Government for submission to the Executive Yuan for record. The telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Report to the National Government) I, humbly report that the prohibition of opium is a policy of our Party, and clear orders have been issued repeatedly, no less than three times. The people in various places have become increasingly indulgent, and the opium ban has become lax. The poisonous flames have become even more intense. When Zhongzheng (Chiang Kai-shek's given name) led the army to Wuhan, what he saw and heard was that not only had ordinary people with addictions not been completely cured, but also party, government, and military service personnel, and young students, were drinking poison and enjoying it. Those who had become addicted were found everywhere. The rumors were spreading, and the effects were becoming more pronounced. If this continues, the descendants of Yan and Huang will gradually die out, and the species will no longer exist. What will become of the country? Every time I think of this, I feel pain. I have investigated the previous handling of the opium ban, and most of those who were caught in the legal net were commoners. Party, government, and military service personnel always regarded themselves as a special class, smoking at will, and not feeling strange. The police authorities also considered the situation and pretended not to see anything. The opium ban was rarely effective, and this was the reason. Therefore, I drafted the Measures for Party, Government, Military Service Personnel, and Students to Quit Smoking Within a Time Limit. All party, government, and military service personnel and students who smoke opium and substitutes such as morphine and heroin must register to quit within two weeks. After the deadline, the verification rules will be followed to conduct thorough verification. If anyone fails to register after the deadline and continues to smoke, he will be shot immediately upon verification. This will start with party, government, military, and student personnel to make the general public aware and fearful. The prohibition order will be easier to implement. Since the implementation, it has been quite effective. In addition to the Measures for Investigating and Prohibiting Opium Poppy Planting in Various Provinces, which have been reported separately, the reasons for handling the Measures for Party, Government, Military Service Personnel, and Students to Quit Smoking Within a Time Limit are reported together with the Measures for Party, Government, Military Service Personnel, and Students to Quit Smoking Within a Time Limit and the Verification Rules for your examination and record, and for submission to the Executive Yuan for record. (The measures and rules are omitted)</p>
<p>(Telegram to Various Provinces) Chairman Gu of Zhenjiang, Chairman Lu of Hangzhou, Pacification Commissioner Cai of Fuzhou, Chairman Jiang (Jiangxi), Chairman Xiong of Nanchang, Chairman He of Changsha, Chairman Wu of Anqing, Pacification Commissioner Liu of Kaifeng, Chairman Liu (Henan), Pacification Commissioner Yang of Xi'an, Chairman Yang (Shaanxi), Chairman Shao of Lanzhou, Chairman Xia of Wuchang, Pacification Commissioner He of Hankou, and the Army Commanders, all for your information. The prohibition of opium must begin with the prohibition of opium poppy planting. A telegram was previously sent ordering strict compliance, and Measures for Dispatching Personnel to Investigate and Prohibit Opium Poppy Planting in Ten Provinces were formulated and circulated for compliance. Now that the Winter Solstice is approaching, which is the time for planting poppy seeds, special commissioners should be carefully selected and appointed in accordance with the regulations and measures. Beforehand, in each province, seriously investigate and prohibit it. The provincial governments should investigate and consider the situation in each county, first select appropriate personnel, go to various counties to investigate, and cooperate with the county magistrate to combine punishment and persuasion to ensure that the seeds do not enter the soil. If the handling is ineffective or perfunctory, and the special commissioners dispatched by the headquarters find opium seedlings during their on-the-spot investigation, the chairman and the military commanders will be held accountable. All original investigators and local officials in charge will be dealt with by military law. It is hoped that you will all comply. (December 7th)</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Industrial Department is Abolished</h3>
<p>The Matters in Its Charge Are Merged into the Construction Department</p>
<p>The Transfer Will Be Implemented in Mid-December</p>
<p>Affiliated Agencies to be Closed by the End of the Year</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee decided to abolish and merge the Industrial Department into the Construction Department, the department has begun to handle the closure. It is now heard that the official affairs of each section of the department will be handled by the Construction Department as of the 6th. The transfer period is around the 15th of this month. As for the various affiliated agencies, it is feared that it will be necessary to extend to the end of this month to complete the closure. It is understood that the Industrial Department's past achievements were still good. This time, the provincial government decided to abolish and merge it due to financial exhaustion and inability to open up new sources of revenue, in order to reduce expenditures. It is thought that after the Construction Department takes over, although the agency will be changed, the business will not be affected. Attached below is the Jiangsu Provincial Government's order to the Industrial Department: "In accordance with the decision of the 594th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, the Industrial Department is abolished, and all the duties under the jurisdiction of the department are handed over to the Construction Department for thorough abolition and merger. In addition to submitting a report and issuing a separate order, this order is issued to the department for compliance. The affairs handled shall be closed as of the 15th of this month and reported. All staff salaries shall be approved for payment until the end of this month. You must comply."</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Establishes Refugee Factories</h3>
<p>One Factory to Be Established in Each of the Five Districts of the Province</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Allocates Post-Disaster Relief Funds to Prepare</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi Province has been ravaged by bandits for six years. The bandit scourge has spread throughout the province. Although the army has repeatedly encircled and suppressed them several times, the bandits have fled and returned. As a result, the bandit disaster has been very serious. The disaster situation is particularly serious in Yongxin, Ninggang, and Lianhua in western Jiangxi; Yudu, Xingguo, Ruijin, Shicheng, Ningdu, Huichang, Anyuan, and Xunwu in southern Jiangxi; Guangchang, Lichuan, and Hengfeng in eastern Jiangxi; and Tonggu, Wanzai, and Xiushui in northern Jiangxi. When Zhou Hunyuan, Wu Jinwen, and other divisions recently recaptured Hengfeng, it was just a scorched earth. Being in it was like entering the Gobi Desert. The rest can be imagined. Therefore, in the counties occupied by the Red Bandits and in the areas where they emerged and fought, residents have been unable to live in peace and have mostly fled to places where they can survive more easily. They are displaced and starving people are everywhere. In the past, disaster relief related to bandit disasters, such as setting up a refugee shelter in a neighboring county when a county was invaded by bandits, and distributing emergency relief once a newly recaptured county was liberated, were all passive and temporary relief measures. There has been no active, fundamental plan. Governor Xiong of the Provincial Government, seeing that the number of displaced refugees in various places is increasing day by day, has specially allocated 100,000 yuan of post-bandit relief donations to carry out work relief. He ordered the Provincial Relief Committee to jointly plan with the Civil Affairs, Construction, and Education Departments. The four agencies have decided on a plan to set up a factory each in Nanchang, Ganzhou, Ji'an, Pingxiang, and Shangrao to accommodate refugees from bandit areas and teach them skills to make a living, so that they can work and earn a living. Those who receive relief will not only be relieved of their current hunger and cold, but also have the opportunity to practice skills and engage in occupations, which will benefit both society and individuals. All refugees in the province have been registered by the Provincial Relief Committee and sent to designated Jian Sheng Middle School and other schools. According to the skills filled in on the refugee registration form, they will be tested. Those who are proficient will be provided with other arrangements. The rest will be assigned to various work-study classes according to their similar nature, including dyeing, weaving, soap making, sewing, rattan work, carpentry, stone printing, and other subjects. Women will be taught by the Women's Vocational School, the Women's Weaving Training School, and the Women's Public School. The rest will be taught by the Industrial College, the Agricultural College, the First Vocational School, the Second Vocational School, and Jian Sheng. It is heard that after the training period is over, they will be sent to work in the factory. Teachers from the above schools will be responsible for technical guidance. The relief funds will allocate 10,000 yuan as equipment and raw material purchase funds, which will be expanded in the future to establish each subject separately in order to promote the development of industry. As for the factories in Shangrao, Ganzhou, Pingxiang, and Ji'an, they must also be handled in accordance with the provincial capital's methods. The local administrative commissioners will be responsible for carrying them out. In addition to the funds allocated by the provincial treasury, the rest will be borrowed locally. (November 6th)</p>
<h3>In Jiangsu Province, Counties Abolish Bureaus and Change to Sections</h3>
<p>Already Passed by the Provincial Government Meeting</p>
<p>To Be Implemented on New Year's Day Next Year</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu believes that the current organizational system of the counties has four bureaus below the county magistrate: Public Security, Finance, Education, and Construction, which are respectively governed by the Civil Affairs, Education, Construction, Industry, and Finance Departments. In the counties, he feels that the authority is not unified. In order to increase the authority of the county magistrate and unify the administrative system, he advocates abolishing the bureaus and merging them into the county government, adding several sections to handle various affairs. The Secretariat drafted nine measures, which were submitted to the provincial government meeting for discussion. As the matter was significant, it was decided to have all the provincial committee members, the secretary-general of the provincial government, and the president of the high court jointly review it. Because this case is a major reform of the provincial administrative system, it must be studied in detail. After repeated review, Wang Fangting, the director of the Industry Department, convened a meeting of related agencies last night (5th) to discuss the final decision. Today (6th), it has been submitted to the standing meeting of the provincial government for discussion and passed according to the review plan. All procedures for changing the county organization will be discussed by the departments and submitted for approval. However, the police must follow the company-platoon system of the army (120 people per company). The treatment of the chief of the Public Security Bureau is the same as the company commander, and the chief will be provided with three patrol officers with the same treatment as the platoon commander. The original two sections of the county government remain unchanged. The Finance Bureau is changed to the third section of the county government, the Construction Bureau is changed to the fourth section, and the Education Bureau is changed to the fifth section. The expenses will not change much. The section chiefs will be appointed by the departments in charge at the request of the county government, and the personnel below the section chiefs will be guaranteed by the county government and additionally appointed by the departments in charge. These measures will be approved by the departments and submitted to the government for approval in the coming days, and then the provincial government will issue a circular to implement them on January 1 next year. (December 6th)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>(Zhu Ziyao's Nephew Comes to Suzhou to Commit Suicide) Zhu Ziyao of No. 147, Lai Chou Pier, Shanghai, is a key figure in the Catholic Church and opened the Qiuxin Machine Factory. His eldest son, Binghou, is currently the director of the Aviation Office in Hankou, and his second son, Bingzhe, is a priest in Jinshan County. Zhu Ziyao's nephew, Qiusheng, is 27 years old and has married the daughter of Xu Tongtai Paper Store in Wenpu. He suddenly came to Suzhou to commit suicide. The details of the process and reasons are as follows: Qiusheng left Shanghai last month with 200 yuan and first went to Weiting and other places in Jinshan to play. On the 22nd, when he arrived in Suzhou, he had only 40 yuan left. After arriving in Suzhou, he first stayed at the Suzhou Hotel outside the city, and then moved to Room 23 of the Central Hotel in the city on the 2nd of this month, paying 15 yuan for the room. He used the alias Yu Ziming. Afterwards, he got up at 11:00 every morning and went out, and did not return until after 2:00 in the morning. He was always drunk when he returned. When the bellboy asked where he went during the day, he said he went to Yama to sweep the grave, but it did not work out due to the cold weather. Unexpectedly, before (7th), in the afternoon, he suddenly went to bed and did not get up. He was called but did not respond. The door was pried open and he was found to be unconscious. The charity ward of the hotel knew something was wrong, so it rushed him to Guangmin Hospital for treatment. He gradually regained consciousness in the middle of the night. According to his self-report, he had a mother and two brothers in his family. A lawsuit over property disputes has been going on since 1929 and has not yet been resolved, costing 16,000 to 7,000 yuan. Feeling that the family environment was bad, he secretly took sleeping pills to commit suicide, and so on. Zhu Qiusheng has not yet escaped danger. The Central Hotel has sent someone to notify his family. (Water and land police detectives capture bandits) Xu Fengshan, the detective chief of the Suzhou-Songjiang Water Bandit Suppression Headquarters, received a report from informants that Jiang Dengzhu and other bandits who robbed our crossing-pond farm boats and killed the boat owners were hiding on boats in Fengqiao. He led the police officers on duty to go to Fengqiao on the evening of the 7th and arrested the three bandits Jiang Dengzhu, Wei Xueyou, and Jiang Mingyang, and seized guns, ammunition, stolen goods, etc. They were immediately escorted to the headquarters for interrogation. They confessed that they had intercepted boats crossing the pond and injured the boat owners. They were sent to the headquarters for interrogation on the 8th. In addition, Xue Jun and other detectives from the Public Security Bureau's anti-crime squad arrested the two bandits Li Guangfu and Shao Jiang outside Panmen and also sent them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>(Chief Editor of the "Roar" Newspaper Falsely Accused of Being Reactionary) Zhu Bingdie, the chief editor of the local "Roar" newspaper, resides in front of the New Temple in the city. At 9:00 a.m. on the 29th of last month, his residence was suddenly searched by the Fifth Regiment Headquarters of the Wuxi Gendarmerie on suspicion of being reactionary. As a result, several letters were seized. However, Zhu Bingdie had gone to Anzhen, his hometown, to collect rent at that time, and only his wife, Ni, was at home. Seeing this, she was greatly shocked. Assuming her innocence, she immediately appealed to the News Reporters Association and submitted a request to the county party headquarters to clear her name. After the county party headquarters investigated, it also found that Zhu had always been law-abiding and had no reactionary tendencies. Therefore, in view of yesterday's telegram to Commander Gu Zhenglun of the Capital Gendarmerie, it requested that the case be cleared immediately and dismissed.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>(Robbery and Assault in Yingdong Township) The Zhang Shunxiang family in Zhangjia Village, Yingdong Township, 17th District, Wu County, was suddenly attacked by a group of armed bandits the night before last. After entering the house, they severely beat and burned Xiang, the brother of the victim, causing serious injuries. They then looted all the cash, clothing, and decorations, and set fire to all the miscellaneous items. Afterwards, Lu, the police officer in charge, reported the case to the county on the 7th to seek an arrest warrant.</p>
<p>(Red Spear Society Bandits Sent to Military Tribunal) Zhu Sen, a police officer at the Cui Town Public Security Substation in Wu County, previously arrested Yun Zixiang, Xu Meiyou, Wang Yaochu, Chen Shoukang, and four other members of the Red Spear Society who were plotting to rob Zhangjia Village north of Hengshan Bridge. After questioning them in the county, it was originally intended to transfer them to the court for handling. Unexpectedly, these bandits recently secretly instructed their associates to send letters threatening the county government. County Magistrate Zhang, believing that these bandits were involved in reactionary activities, immediately ordered Secretary Wu Jun to interrogate the four bandits, including Yun Zixiang, once more. On the 7th, he prepared documents and sent police officers to escort them to the Zhenjiang Military Tribunal for interrogation and trial.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>(Mutiny of Soldiers in the 7th Company) The Provincial Security Forces sent two companies of soldiers to Yangzhou to provide security due to the land tax unrest. The 7th Company, stationed at Pingshan Hall, suddenly mutinied at 10 p.m. the night before last. More than 50 soldiers deserted, killing one platoon leader and one squad leader, as well as two horses. They took with them 47 rifles and one box gun, and fled towards the northwest countryside. A team was dispatched to the Xishan area to conduct a thorough search and arrest.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>(Villager Suffers Torture for Buying Salt) Zhang Zhengkang, a farmer from Nanwang Township, 12th District, Danyang County, made a living by farming and had never done anything out of line. Unexpectedly, he encountered trouble for buying salt. Wang Yuhua, a police chief of the 6th District of the Songjiang Salt Affairs Verification Branch Tax Police Bureau, stationed in Yinsha, Wujin County, led more than ten armed police officers directly to Zhang Zhengkang's home. Claiming to be investigating salt, they ransacked the place and harassed everyone. They arrested Zhang Zhengkang and took him to their headquarters, where they tortured him without asking for any explanation. They stabbed Zhang's legs with a knife, causing blood to flow like a river, and he fainted to the ground. His brother, Zhang Zhengji, heard the news and rushed to Yinsha. Seeing the situation, he asked what was happening, but the police officers, relying on their official positions, drove him away with stern voices, saying, "Being stabbed and tortured is a small matter; you could even be shot." Zhang Zhengji kept quiet and came to Zhenjiang to find a way to rescue his brother, only to find himself in an even worse situation. Yesterday, he happened to meet the culprit, Wang Yuhua, at the Zhao Shang Ju wharf. He grabbed him and handed him over to the police at the 4th Public Security Bureau, requesting that he be sent to the court for trial. Unexpectedly, the bureau handed Zhang over to the 6th District of the Tax Police Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>(Rickshaw Pullers' General Strike) After the war, the rickshaw pullers, finding business slow, were convened by the county chamber of commerce and the rickshaw companies, who decided that the city would limit the number of rickshaws to 180 to alleviate the situation. It was decided that Jiji and Changfa companies would each have 50 rickshaws, Renji company would have 60, and Jiao Ta company would have 10. The First District Public Office was to issue the licenses accordingly and not exceed the limit. Recently, Renji and Jiji companies, claiming to operate in Xujiahang, obtained several licenses from the Third District Public Office beyond the limit and came to the city to operate. The day before yesterday, someone reported this to the First District Public Office, which reported it to the County Public Security Bureau. Four rickshaws of Renji company that were using Third District licenses were impounded. Subsequently, Renji rickshaw pullers discovered that Jiji company was also using Third District licenses for several rickshaws, which led to negotiations. The rickshaw pullers, believing that the rickshaw companies were undermining the established limits and affecting their livelihood, went on strike en masse starting on the 7th. A few who were unwilling to join were coerced into stopping by the crowd. The County Public Security Bureau has asked the County Chamber of Commerce to mediate, but there has been no result yet.</p>
<p>(Thief Steals Military Uniform and is Caught) At the Nanxiang Road Intersection Central School, during the evening meal on the 6th, Jin, a female teacher, had her suitcase, shirts, gloves, and other items stolen from the dormitory. The next day, during the evening meal, Director Shen Zhongqing, having returned from outside, saw a person in the darkness. When asked, the person's answer was evasive. When the light was turned on, it was discovered that the person was wearing a military overcoat and did not look like a student. Suspecting him, he was handed over to the police station. On the way, the thief pretended to urinate and dropped a pair of gloves. Shen picked them up and realized that they were the ones stolen from Teacher Jin the night before. He was sent to the First Public Security Bureau. A Treasury Department tax stamp symbol was also found on his waist. Director Wang immediately sent the person and the stolen goods to the county for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>(Hanged Himself Due to Heavy Debt) Lai Jifa, from Shalang, a place in the western countryside of Xiaoshan County, made a living by cultivating sandy land. In recent years, due to having many nieces and daughters, he had difficulty making ends meet, leading to heavy debts that he could not repay. The other day, because the creditors were pressing him for payment, which he could not afford, he took advantage of the absence of others and hanged himself. By the time his family found out, he had already died. His wife, née Lu, with seven children left behind and no way to make a living after her husband's death, also drowned herself in the river early on the 6th. It is reported.</p>

<h3>Cancellation of Rice Certificate Tax in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Minister Song's strong efforts</p>
<p>Seeking other ways to fund road construction</p>
<p>The drastic fall in rice prices in the Yangtze River region this year is unprecedented in recent years. The reasons for this are nothing more than the dumping of foreign rice and the inability of domestic rice to circulate freely, which are the crux of the problem. Previously, Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, in view of this situation, convened representatives of rice-producing provinces in Beijing to hold a conference on regulating the food supply. The main points of the agenda were, first, to ensure the unimpeded flow of domestic rice, and second, to discuss the issues of levying import taxes on foreign rice and providing storage loans. The loan issue has already been settled and implemented in Shanghai with the financial community. Regarding the imposition of taxes on foreign rice nationwide, this goal cannot be achieved unless the circulation of rice nationwide is first ensured and all kinds of rice taxes are completely abolished. Recently, the price of rice in Anhui Province has averaged less than five yuan per shi, and the rice tax has been levied at a rate of six jiao, which is most obstructive to circulation. Minister Song paid extreme attention to this matter and strongly advocated for its cancellation. It is now reported that the Anhui Provincial Government has passed a resolution in its Standing Committee to cancel all food certificate taxes in the province. The rice certificate tax, which had been criticized by the people in the past, has thus been decisively abolished, bringing an end to the matter. However, this rice certificate tax was previously designated as a fund for building roads. Now that it has been cancelled, the Ministry of Finance is reportedly planning to find other ways to subsidize the road construction expenses, so as not to interrupt the road work. In summary, it can be seen that Minister Song is concerned about the people's hardships and has strong determination and enthusiasm, and that the effects of the Ministry of Finance's food conference will also be observable.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Explains Zhenru Joint Transportation Station Plan</h3>
<p>Saying the enclosed land area</p>
<p>Is already impossible to reduce further</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has decided to construct a joint transportation station for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Jiaotong Road in Shanghai, to the west. The estimated ground area is located north and south of the existing rail line, within the Pengpu District of the Zhenru area of Shanghai. A brief explanation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Situation Requirements</h3>
<p>The location of railway stations is closely related to the development of the city. The Shanghai Municipal Government previously issued the Shanghai Central Area Plan, proposing to establish a passenger terminal station next to the Zhongshan North Road in the west of the city center. The freight terminal station was to be moved to the outskirts of the city along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, near Zhenru. It also argued that the existing North Station was obstructing traffic in Zhabei and advocated for its relocation. The Ministry of Railways studied the matter in detail and also recognized the necessity of relocating the station for construction. Furthermore, the North Station was planned 30 years ago. Now, the population of Shanghai has increased and commerce has flourished, which is vastly different from 30 years ago. Therefore, the location and facilities of the North Station are insufficient to meet today's needs, let alone those of decades from now. Now, after the war, houses have collapsed and equipment has been damaged. Rather than patching things up and maintaining the status quo, which would be difficult to streamline railway traffic and would also obstruct the progress of the city, it was decided to choose a new location and rebuild, for a permanent solution.</p>
<h3>Design and Site Selection</h3>
<p>In order to meet the current needs of Shanghai and to replace the North Station, a suitable location for the joint transportation station should be established in the western suburbs of Shanghai designated by the Shanghai Municipal Government, which is convenient for the loading and unloading of passengers and freight and is close to the North Station. Therefore, the selection of the joint transportation station location and all layout plans must adhere to three principles: 1. The distance from the current city center of Shanghai cannot be too far. 2. The joint transportation of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways must be convenient and maintain their connection. 3. The terminal station must be located in Jiangwan in the future. The design and location of the joint transportation station should take into account the convenience of trains reaching the terminal station directly. Based on these three principles, the joint transportation station must be located at the intersection of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways, and the trains passing through the station should avoid the roundabout route of the North Station. The current passenger trains mostly use it as a terminus, but after the Jiangwan passenger terminal station is built in the future, the volume of transportation passing through will increase. Therefore, this joint transportation station is designed according to the scale of a through station. The track layout has multiple crossovers, and each line seeks to be economical and practical. The platform and station building facilities are mainly for the convenience of passengers. In order to reduce shunting time, the locomotive depot and car depot are properly arranged so that after the train is unloaded at the station, it can proceed directly to the car depot. The locomotive passes through the curve and enters the locomotive depot to change direction, preparing for the return journey. Once the plan was finalized, it met the above three principles and was suitable for practical use, and the current plot of land was selected.</p>
<h3>Area of Land Occupied</h3>
<p>The joint transportation station occupies a total area of 2,800 mu, of which approximately 150 mu is occupied by the roadbed, and the rest is necessary for the track layout and various building equipment. The increase in railway business, the rapid development of Shanghai in the future, and the prosperity of the port will all grow rapidly. If preparations are not made early, it is feared that the area will not be sufficient in less than 50 years. In order to facilitate passengers and businesses, in addition to the aforementioned station building, track, car depot, and locomotive depot layout, all freight yards, various offices, railway hotels, staff dormitories, and other railway-related buildings are arranged near the station building so that the work efficiency of railway employees can be improved in the future and the convenience of merchants and travelers can be increased. Therefore, the design of this joint transportation station is not only for meeting the current passenger and freight transportation needs. The occupied area of 2,800 mu cannot be reduced any further.</p>
<h3>British Parliamentarians Discuss Shanghai Special Court</h3>
<p>Reuters News Agency, London, 7th dispatch, Conservative Party member Clayton asked the government in the House of Commons today whether the Shanghai Special District Court matter will be discussed with the Shanghai Municipal Council.

Conservative Party member Kobartrick asked Foreign Minister Simon whether he would advocate that the Municipal Council retain the right to manage judicial police. Eden replied that the government will give due attention to this key point.</p>

<h3>Sichuan River Shipping Gradually Recovering</h3>
<p>Shipping Companies Discuss Increasing Freight Rates</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Sichuan War, Chongqing concentrated cash, issued grain tax treasury bonds, and strictly investigated the outflow of silver dollars, which led to financial stagnation and soaring exchange rates, affecting all industries. The Sichuan merchants stopped handling goods one after another, and river shipping in Sichuan was almost completely interrupted for more than a month. Recently, as the war zone has moved towards Chengdu, the demand for goods in Chongqing has been very high. The Sichuan merchants have begun to come to Shanghai to purchase goods. The first batch of 1,500 bales of disaster relief cotton yarn has been purchased and is scheduled to be transported to Yichang tonight by British ships for transshipment to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Shanghai's largest export to Sichuan is cotton yarn. In recent years, due to excessive competition among Chinese and foreign ships, freight rates have been repeatedly reduced. The freight per bale has only been seven or eight taels of silver. During the Sichuan War, many of the Minsheng Shipping Company's ships were seized and detained by Liu Xiang. They have now been released and have returned to Shanghai. The company has specifically notified Taikoo, Jardine, and Jiejiang to negotiate an increase in the freight rate for cotton yarn shipped from Shanghai to Chongqing. The proposed increase is from seven or eight taels of silver to fifteen taels per bale. Negotiations are currently underway.</p>

<h3>Request to Prohibit the Issuance of Patriotic Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association, noting recent news reports about the issuance of patriotic lottery ticket advertisements, sent a letter to the municipal government requesting that the issuance be prohibited. The letter stated: "Respectfully, we have found that the harm of lotteries has deeply penetrated people's hearts, and the lower and middle classes are particularly affected. The Shanghai market was almost a lottery world several years ago. Today, on the roads of Min Guo, Edward, and Jielu, lottery shops face each other across the street. Vendors hawk tickets everywhere. Poor and pitiful men and women scramble, like moths to a flame. As it becomes more difficult to make a living, the desire to speculate becomes more urgent. Often, they spend every penny, pawn their clothes and accessories, and even borrow money from relatives and friends in order to win the lottery, unaware that for every one person who wins, there are hundreds or thousands who do not. The more they buy, the poorer they become, and the more they cannot stop. How pitiful this is! Those who sell tickets use their cunning to lure the ignorant masses with the bait of one person out of hundreds or thousands winning the lottery. Their techniques are extremely skillful, and their hearts are extremely poisonous. For the past twenty years, those who could not bear to see the suffering of the common people have advocated against lotteries, and this has gradually become public opinion. However, in the corner of Shanghai, prohibitions are repeatedly relaxed, and within and outside the concessions, one side prohibits while the other side relaxes. They either claim to be for charity or change the name to prize tickets, but the disaster does not end. Until May 13, 1927, the Shanghai Temporary Branch of the Central Political Conference of the Chinese Nationalist Party resolved to order the police to prohibit the issuance of all prize tickets with gambling characteristics, and to thoroughly investigate and ban them. The entire city was cleansed, and to this day, the people are grateful and believe that this was the beginning of good governance since the revolution. Recently, patriotic lottery tickets have suddenly appeared in Shanghai, shocking those who have seen them. According to their advertisements, the sources and uses are very ambiguous. Regardless of whether the motive is good or bad, the fact that prize tickets, which have just been banned, are reappearing in Shanghai is like embers reviving. We deeply fear that once this door is opened, the general lottery merchants will seize the opportunity to rise up, and from then on the common people will suffer endlessly, and foreigners will hear of it and laugh secretly. This matter may not have been authorized by the Mayor. We firmly believe that the Mayor cares about the people's livelihood, and cannot bear to see the poor and common people suffer such harm again, nor can he bear to see the good governance since the revolution destroyed in a single day and bring shame to China and foreign countries. We respectfully present public opinion and humbly request that you quickly order the prohibition of the issuance, so that the ban will not be overturned and your merit will be immeasurable. Respectfully, Wu, Mayor of Shanghai Municipality."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Notice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to various agencies, trade associations, labor unions, schools, and other organizations: "Respectfully, our Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop participated in the rescue work during the Shanghai War. A memorial service will be held for the four martyred members at our Chamber of Commerce Auditorium at [time] PM on the 11th of this month. A special letter is hereby sent to you, and we respectfully request that you attend the meeting on time. We would also appreciate it if you could send us a written tribute in advance to honor the memory of the deceased, and we would be deeply grateful."</p>

The medals are in a rectangular redwood box with the words "Medal of Honor for Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage of the Boy Scouts of China" inscribed on it, with the words "Sacrifice to Save Others" in the center, and the senior badge of the Boy Scouts, with the words "Presented by Chiang Kai-shek, President of the General Association of Boy Scouts of China" inscribed below. The medals have now been collected by the head of the 50th Troop for permanent preservation in the troop's headquarters, to commemorate the deceased and to encourage others.</p>

<h3>All Circles Appeal for Rescue of Su's Army</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Patriotic Organizations sent a telegram to military personnel nationwide, stating (titles omitted): "The terrible news has arrived that Su's army, under intense attack by the Japanese army and lacking reinforcements, has suffered casualties of more than half its troops and has been forced to retreat into Russian territory. Our federation is deeply alarmed by this news. Ever since the invasion by the brutal Japanese and the fall of the Northeast, people across the country have risen up to seek salvation. The volunteer armies outside the customs have all sworn to fight to the death against the enemy, bravely resisting for over a year. Our armed forces should inherit Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings on national salvation. How can we merely talk about resistance, abandon our duty to defend our territory and protect our country, sit idly by enjoying peace, and ignore the demise of our nation and people? We turn a deaf ear to the cries of the people and are blind to the hand-to-hand combat of the volunteer armies. We passively accept and allow the Japanese imperialists to invade and trample upon us. Now that the volunteer armies have suffered defeats and the country is in increasing danger, if this continues, will our nation have any survivors left? We believe that all the soldiers across the country, witnessing the enemy's high morale and the country facing destruction, cannot but feel heartbroken. We should all rise up together, request permission from the government to fight against Japan, protect our country, cherish our people, bravely kill the enemy, and fulfill our duties. Our people nationwide pledge to be your support, working together to recover our lost territory, uphold justice, and maintain peace. This would be fortunate for the country and fortunate for the nation. With heartfelt tears and anguish, we implore all our soldiers across the country to consider this carefully." Respectfully submitted by Zhang Junguang and others, standing directors of the National Federation of Patriotic Organizations.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the General Labor Union sent a telegram to the Central Committee in Nanjing, stating: "To the Central Party Headquarters of Nanjing, respectfully to the National Government: Reading General Su Bingwen's telegram sent from Hailar on the 6th, which recounted the unbearable oppression by the Japanese army, ultimately leading to exhausted ammunition and cut-off reinforcements, forcing him to retreat into Russian territory with great sorrow, the shocking news brought forth both blood and tears. The Liaoji region has fallen into enemy hands for over a year now. Alas, enemy troops run rampant everywhere, and our compatriots suffer cruelly from their oppression. Fortunately, the isolated army in the desolate border region raised the banner of righteousness high, punishing those wicked invaders and revitalizing our national spirit. However, due to insufficient supplies and lack of reinforcements, they were unable to achieve complete success and even suffered cruel oppression. Thinking of this, our hearts are filled with pain. Now, Su's army has fallen into foreign territory, and their lives and safety hang by a thread. We humbly beg Your Excellency to quickly devise a way to rescue them and to properly arrange for the relief of other volunteer armies so they may expel the invaders and protect our land, offering some hope. The telegram conveys our grief and indignation, filled with the utmost trepidation. Respectfully submitted, Shanghai General Labor Union."</p>
<h3>Wang Delin Sends Letter to Shanghai Seeking Assistance</h3>
<p>▲ Bitter cold beyond the border, skin splitting</p>
<p>▲ Fellow countrymen, let us help each other</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Chuyu, representative in Shanghai of Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, received a letter yesterday from the army's office in Peiping, hoping that Mr. Zhang would actively seek assistance in Shanghai. The letter stated (excerpts): "Recently, we received a letter from Commander-in-Chief Wang stating that our army's spirit of resisting Japan remains consistent and united. Their willingness to brave ice and snow and sacrifice their lives is especially growing stronger. As they are now exposed to the elements and launching a major siege of the provincial capital, they are wearing only light clothing and enduring extreme cold. This has already caused concern among our fellow countrymen. However, the bitter cold, with skin splitting, is indescribably cruel. Since the beginning of winter, there has been no assistance. Currently, officers and soldiers alike are facing the same difficulties. Some are stuffing稻草 into their coats and trousers due to the lack of cotton. Others have乌拉(俗名靰鞡) that are torn and temporarily mended with tough tree bark. Other items like leather hats and gloves are even more scarce. All these hardships, compared to the fine clothes and delicious food and fat horses of our countrymen inside the customs, are truly worlds apart. If we lose military opportunities due to the cold, and our tens of thousands of iron-blooded warriors die not from the artillery fire of the brutal Japanese but from the disruption of rear support, the failure of our efforts will be deeply regretted. However, our army is determined to fulfill its comrades' wishes of restoring our territory, and even if we are at our wit's end, we will fight to the death, vowing never to retreat. However, the great distance to the border is also a major factor. The survival of our territory is at stake, and we cannot sit idly by and listen to defeat. We are especially conveying the urgent reasons and requesting our compatriots at home and abroad to quickly provide practical salvation. Time is of the essence, and we are filled with anticipation."

<h3>Important News of Groups Aiding Volunteer Armies</h3>
<p>▲ Transportation Team</p>

According to the set plan, departures will take place every two weeks. However, due to the initial establishment, procedures were inevitably slightly delayed, so the first departure could not be punctual. However, this was due to unavoidable circumstances. The team is now preparing for its first departure today, and after further training, it can depart. At the beginning of the team's organization, I, together with Ding Chao and Li Du of the National Salvation Army, and Liu Piguang, the representative of the Shanghai office, were in charge and received their instructions to organize the Northeast Volunteer Army Transportation Team. Liu has been invited to personally inspect the team after its organization. As for the service locations, Liu has been contacted in advance to designate them, and they will generally be within the operational areas of the Li and Ding units. In short, the various procedures for the team's first departure have been completed in order. Only the uniforms are still being rushed, but they should be completed by the 14th. The various materials needed have been mostly obtained since the solicitation, so there will be no problems during departure. As for the departure date, it should be within about a week.</p>
<p>▲ Propaganda Troupe</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Propaganda Troupe has been actively working since its establishment. Yesterday, the troupe held a meeting of various sections and groups at its office at No. 33 Jing'an Villa. More than ten people, including Li Jianhong, Liu Xiaotian, Yuan Qingping, Liu Henwo, Ma Hanru, and Li Jianping, attended to discuss expanding propaganda. It was decided: (1) to add a drama section, with Tiao Hongying and Yu Zhumin as directors; (2) that those patriotic youths requesting to join must be from the Northeast or Southern who can speak with a Northern accent, regardless of gender (those with photography knowledge are preferred). However, when registering, they must provide a detailed resume. After passing the review and completing training, they will be organized into teams and sent north; (3) the supplies needed for the propaganda team's departure will be solicited by the communication section from relevant parties. Receipts will be issued upon delivery; (4) News about the volunteer armies will be collected, compiled, and translated by the translation section as soon as possible, and named *Iron Blood Monthly*.</p>
<h3>Details of the Jin Che Case</h3>
<p>The *New Voice Society* reports that since the kidnapping of naturalized citizen Jin Yongduo by Japanese secret agents, people at home and abroad have been paying close attention to this case. In addition to the main characters, Jin Che, Jin Zhe, and the traitor Huang Zhanying, there are several background figures. They are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(Establishment of the Anti-Japanese Grand Alliance)</p>
<p>Jin Yongduo is an important figure from Korea who naturalized in China several years ago and has many contacts with Chinese people. After the September 18th Incident, Zhao Shilong from Yangzhou became friends with Ji Zhuqing and introduced Ji to Jin and others. At that time, anti-Japanese organizations were springing up, and the newspapers were full of publicity. Zhao Shilong was running around organizing the Anti-Japanese Grand Alliance. The planned policies were: (1) no publicity in the newspapers; (2) members must be loyal, righteous, capable, and efficient, focusing on doing practical work rather than making empty gestures; (3) expenses would be borne by the initiators; (4) strict secrecy. Therefore, except for the letter requesting assistance for Ahn Chang-ho to the Law Society, which was published in the newspapers, this name was never seen circulating in society. People like Jin Yongduo and Jin Zhe are among the members. However, the contents of the alliance have been fully reported to the Japanese consulate by Huang Zhanying. There is no need to maintain strict secrecy at this moment, so Ji Zhuqing will make a lengthy report to the public.</p>
<p>(Bitter Cold Night Rescue)</p>
<p>On the night of the 30th of last month, after Jin Yongduo was kidnapped, Ji Zhuqing received a report from Jin's wife, Cui Huishun. Ji went to the scene of the incident to investigate everything and learned that Huang Zhanying had betrayed him. Ji then went to find lawyer Wu Kaisheng but could not find him. He then saw lawyer Cai Xiaobai. Cai, upon hearing that Ji had arrived, got up in his clothes, his teeth chattering, and immediately agreed to negotiate with the French consulate according to the law. Ji also went to find a key member of the anti-Japanese organization, Mr. Zheng, to ask for his assistance. He also went to find Mr. Xu of the alliance but could not find him. He then went to the French police station to visit Jin Zhe and the captured Japanese secret agent. Because it was late at night, he did not see them, but he saw Jin Zhe lying inside the door. Later, after Jin Zhe was out of danger, Ji and lawyer Cai Xiaobai went to the municipal government to petition. At 8:00 PM that night, Jin Yongduo was finally released through the French consulate's negotiation.</p>
<p>(Risking Death for Safe Escape)</p>
<p>After Jin Yongduo was released from the French consulate, he went to the Dahutian Hotel in Dongxinqiao and opened room 606. He immediately invited Ji Zhuqing to come and discuss a way to escape. Even Jin's wife, Cui Huishun, did not know where Jin was staying. At that time, traitors and Japanese secret agents were densely packed at the North and South train stations, and Jin was seriously injured. Ji then asked a famous doctor from the Red Cross to treat him. On the morning of the 4th, Ji took Jin and his son in a car and said to Jin, "If Japanese secret agents attack at this moment, I will definitely resist with my self-defense gun. I would rather die together than be captured by Japanese secret agents. If Japanese secret agents follow Jin's tracks here, I will not be able to justify myself. Today is a critical moment for your life and death, and also for mine." Jin and others went downstairs and took a car to the home of Ji's friend, Mr. Zheng. Zheng said that both the North and South train stations were dangerous and that he would find a way to avoid them. After a while, he said that driving on a certain road to a certain place would be safe. Jin and others believed him and went to the countryside by car, staying in a village. On the 6th, they finally arrived in a safe area. On the 7th, a letter was sent to Shanghai to express their gratitude.</p>
<p>(Collecting Evidence to Prepare a Lawsuit)</p>
<p>Ji Zhuqing said that Huang Zhanying reported the case documents and the secrets of the alliance to the Japanese consulate. All members, except those who are in the same boat as Huang, will never associate with Huang's party. He is currently collecting the events of the past year to publish to the public and plans to sue Huang Zhanying for endangering the country. He has already submitted a request to the authorities to investigate and deal with him according to the law. Ji Zhuqing is from Lianshui and has lived in Shanghai for many years. For the past three months, Ji has been traveling back and forth between Qingjiangpu and Nanjing and has not met with Jin and his son, nor has he met with Huang Zhanying. This has led to this disaster. Ji is now collecting facts, and a detailed description of the case will be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Jin Che Abandons the Return of Property)</p>
<p>Cai Xiaobai, Jin Yongduo's representative lawyer, previously sent a letter to the French consulate,</p>
<p>requesting a request to the Japanese Consulate for the return of confiscated</p>
<p>property. Lawyer Cai has now received a reply from the French Consulate. However, the property confiscated by the Japanese side has not been returned to the original owner, but only temporarily retained by the French Consulate. The original letter stated: "In reply, the Japanese Consul has recently sent a passbook from Ningbo Commercial Bank for 175 yuan, 5 jiao, and 9 fen, as well as 5 yuan and 3 jiao in cash, and other miscellaneous items, which are temporarily being kept. After verifying Jin Yongduo's nationality, they will be returned immediately." However, yesterday it was heard that Jin Che had sent a letter to a friend in Shanghai, instructing him to notify lawyer Cai Xiaobai that he did not need to claim the money and goods returned by the Japanese Consulate and was willing to give them up. He only hoped that he would work hard to negotiate the protection of the sovereignty and dignity of China and France, and not cause any bad consequences due to this, harming future naturalized citizens, Korean residents, and other residents of all kinds. He strongly agreed with lawyer Wu Kaisheng's negotiation outline. (Naturalization Certificate Photography Research)</p>
<p>Jin Yongduo's naturalization certificate, after being sent by the French consulate to the French embassy in Beiping, has been photographed by the French side, and the original certificate was sent by the French consulate to Jin's representative lawyer, Cai Xiaobai, yesterday.</p>
<p>(Wu Chengyu's Letter Explaining the Circumstances)</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu Chengyu sent a letter to the newspapers yesterday stating: "With respect, I have read in the newspapers that a friend of Jin Che said that Zhanying had followed me for a long time and that he suffered this disaster because he trusted me. I am very surprised to read this. Upon investigation, Huang Zhanying only lived at my office at 107 Nanjing Road after the January 28th Incident when he had nowhere to live. Later, when my office moved, Huang left and was not a salaried employee of my office. As for the Korean side, I only met Jin Yongduo and Jin Zhe for the first time at Guanshengyuan between February and March of this year. I did not meet Jin Che at that time. Huang of Guanshengyuan may have met him at this time, but it was not I who introduced them. Moreover, the newspaper reported that Jin Che said that he had met Huang last year. At that time, I had not met Jin, so how could he have trusted me? Since the 19th Route Army left Shanghai, I have stopped participating in national salvation organizations for a long time. I do not know how Huang and Jin communicated. The words of a certain gentleman published in your newspaper were because Ji Zhuqing came to my office on the 5th and talked about the words published in various newspapers. Therefore, I went to meet Ji and learned of Jin Zhe's letter. I immediately wrote a letter to ask him to reply with the detailed situation. I am afraid that Huang has impersonated my name. Please publish this letter within a limited time, otherwise, I will file a lawsuit and ask for an investigation. I am sincerely afraid that outsiders will not ask the truth. Please publish this letter truthfully to avoid misunderstandings. Also, in the future, regarding my reputation, please do not publish anything without any evidence to avoid disputes. This is a matter of public interest.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Issues Statement ▲ Regarding the Beixin Bookstore Incident</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, received a letter yesterday from Zong Tianliang and others of the Northwest Muslim Protection Education Group in Shanghai, inquiring about the Beixin Bookstore case. Wang issued a statement saying that regarding the Beixin Bookstore case, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, upon receiving a letter from the Book Industry Association stating that it was handling the case according to the Commercial Association Law and accepting the appeals of its members, had only forwarded it and that he had never contacted the Public Works Department. Furthermore, he is not a Chinese director of the Public Works Department. The inquiries in the letter are mostly misunderstandings.</p>
<p>National Flood Relief Association</p>
<h3>Inspection Record of the Completion of the Embankment Project (11)</h3>
<p>(Hubei Provincial Government Banquet)</p>
<p>The Hubei Provincial Government and the Hubei Flood Relief Committee held a banquet on the evening of the 3rd at the Jincheng Bank Building to entertain the entire embankment survey team. Over a hundred people attended, including Xia Douyin, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government; He Chengjiao, Chairman of the Hubei Flood Relief Committee; Yang Wentai, Secretary-General of the Headquarters; Feng Chenxi, Adjutant of the Deputy Officer; and all members of the embankment survey committee. At the banquet, Xia Douyin delivered a welcoming speech, saying, in brief, that Hubei suffered the most from last year's floods. Of the 68 counties in the province, 59 were affected, and of the 35 million people in the province, 30 million were victims. Fortunately, various sectors of Shanghai and friends from other countries generously donated money to provide emergency relief, saving the people of Hubei from water and fire. Moreover, with the rapid completion of the embankment project, the rural economy was able to recover. Now that you have come to inspect, I would like to express our special gratitude on behalf of the people of the entire province. Chu Minyi then delivered a reply on behalf of Wen Lantian, saying, in brief, that the inspection along the way and the Zhanggong embankment were solid and that they demonstrated the perseverance of the Chinese people and their spirit of hard work in construction. The Japanese concession in the section of the flood control embankment along the Yangtze River in Hankou has not been completed due to various obstacles. If a major flood were to recur, this small gap would cause a major disaster. This is entirely their fault. We should make special efforts to actively engage in construction to revive the country and erase this shame. The embankment project is only a small part of the construction. At about 10 o'clock, the guests enjoyed themselves and the banquet ended. (Qian Hua sent from Hankou on the evening of the 3rd)</p>
<h3>The Business Corps Artillery Team Will Go to Hong Kong ▲ to Practice Live Firing</h3>
<p>The Public Concession International Artillery Team, which was previously inspected by the British Commander in Shanghai, advocated that the team should practice live firing. Colonel Thomson, Commander of the Business Corps, also agreed. It was originally planned to go to Hong Kong early to hold exercises, but this was unsuccessful due to the incident in Shanghai. Now that it has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, the team will go to Hong Kong to carry out exercises. It is scheduled to depart around January 26 or 27 of next year. The team has a total of 30 members. After practicing in Hong Kong for four days, they will return to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Rise Up Again to Resist Additional漕 Taxes</h3>
<p>▲ Jiangsu Provincial Government Violates Orders ▲ Attempts to Go Back on Its Word Again</p>
<p>Citizens of Pudong, Xing Zhigang and others, wrote to the Pudong Fellow Villagers Executive Supervisory Committee yesterday, stating: "Please propose a resolution. According to the Shanghai County Government and the County Finance Bureau's joint announcement, the second phase of land price tax for the 21st year of the Republic of China will be collected on November 25th of the solar calendar, and by provincial order, the additional 漕 taxes will be converted to two taels of silver per stone. This is deeply surprising. According to the investigation, the association has submitted a proposal through the general assembly last year to the Ministry of Finance to abolish the additional levy of two taels per stone for the winter 漕 taxes of the 20th year. Subsequently, the ministry approved it, stating: 'The reasons presented by the directors are that the original plan was limited to once in the 19th year, and in the 20th year, it was extended for one year under false pretenses. It is expected that in the future, they will still apply in the same way, which would be a loss of national credibility. Second, Jiangsu Province stipulates that the field tax of each county should not exceed 1% of the land price. This additional 漕 tax exceeds the 1% range. Third, last year happened to be a year of great famine, so taxes should be reduced to relieve the people. The reasons are also justified. Now, the 20th year is about to end, and the extension of the additional 漕 tax will expire soon. In accordance with the Executive Yuan's approval of the original plan, after the expiration, no further requests for extension can be made under any name. In order to take into account both the provincial treasury and the people's difficulties, the additional漕 taxes of Jiangsu in the 20th year can be approved to continue to be collected according to the original plan, and the Executive Yuan should reiterate the previous order that the deadline for additional 漕 taxes in Jiangsu Province should never be extended, and that the exemption will be implemented from the 21st year to show great credibility and relieve the people's difficulties, etc.' were submitted to the court for review and ordered to be followed, etc. According to the investigation, in the 19th year of the Republic of China, Qin Xitian and others, directors of the County Loan Office, stated that the additional 漕 tax of two yuan per stone could not be considered a regular practice and submitted it to the ministry for approval. It was temporarily limited to once for the winter 漕 tax of the 19th year and should not be increased again. Subsequently, in the winter of the 20th year, after the provincial order to continue the additional征漕taxes to be converted to two taels of silver, the current directors of the County Loan Office, Jiang Shijie and Kang Yongnian, submitted to the provincial, prefectural, and ministerial offices, requesting the cancellation of the additional征漕taxes as soon as possible. It was then approved by the ministry, stating that since the provincial government had repeatedly requested this case, it could still be handled in accordance with the law during the period of bandit suppression. However, the field tax in Jiangsu Province has always been heavy. In addition to the regular tax, there are additional taxes. During this one-year extension period, each county must not add any additional donations under the item of field tax. After the expiration, the provincial government must not request another extension under any name, so that both the provincial treasury and the people's difficulties can be taken into account. The Executive Yuan then issued an order, which was then submitted to the National Government for approval. The ministry then ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department to follow these orders. This is a glorious order from the ministry, which concerns the credibility of the country and should be observed to emphasize the political system. Unexpectedly, the Jiangsu Provincial Government arbitrarily continued to extend the additional levy of two yuan this year, and also added a clearing fee of one yuan and one jiao per stone. This not only ignores the ministry's orders, but also imposes additional taxes. How can the people bear this burden? Moreover, this year there was summer drought and autumn rain, cotton was scarce, and grain was cheap. The rural situation around Fengnanchuan has already shown signs of bankruptcy. The League of Nations has sent personnel to investigate and plans to implement relief measures, but the provincial government has not reviewed it and rashly continues to extend the additional levy. How can the people bear it? We specially appeal to the Executive Supervisory Committee of this association to make a resolution based on the previous case and continue to submit it to the provincial and ministerial authorities for prompt cancellation of the additional levy, or to petition in Beijing until the goal is achieved to emphasize the political system and relieve the people of Jiangsu. This is a matter of public concern." According to inquiries with Pudong fellow villagers, the staff said that this additional漕 tax had been approved. If the provincial government wanted to violate the order and impose additional taxes, not only would the people have difficulty bearing the burden, but the government would also be too untrustworthy. We should immediately convene a meeting to discuss and strive for it. It is also heard that a meeting of directors and supervisors will be held at 4:00 PM on the 15th of this month to discuss it.</p>

<p>Li Zhongli Indian Constable Murder Case</p>
<h3>Landlord Accused of Incitement</h3>
<p>The Indian Constable Was Sent to the District Court for Preliminary Hearing Yesterday</p>
<p>Indian watchman constable You Shufu, 5, killed Zhou Ayu, a tenant who was moving out, in the lane of Li Zhongli, Yuezhou Road, in June of this year. The District Court verified this. However, because the Indian enjoyed consular jurisdiction, the British court sentenced him to ten years of imprisonment. The District Court, because the wife of the deceased, Zhou Zhu, accused the landlord of incitement, needed to question him. Therefore, it sent a letter to the British consulate asking for the case to be sent for preliminary hearing. Therefore, yesterday morning, the British Concession police sent the suspect to the District Court. After Prosecutor Wu conducted a preliminary hearing for a long time, he ordered the police to take him back to execution.</p>
<h3>Xu Jiashi's Home Robbery</h3>
<p>Carriage Driver Conspires with Female Servant</p>
<p>Two Falsely Accused Individuals Released</p>
<p>Xu Jiashi, the former Chief of the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court and current President of the Yichang District Court, entrusted his Shanghai residence at No. 5, Lane 196, Luban Road in the French Concession, to a relative and a female servant named He Ban (from Anhui) and a carriage driver named Xu Longtai (from Jiangbei) for management while he and his family took up his new post. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month at 3 PM, thieves broke the glass of the front door, entered, went upstairs, pried open a leather trunk in the bedroom, smashed a cabinet door, and stole four hundred silver dollars in cash. The police were notified and dispatched detectives to investigate. The servant He Ban and the driver Xu Longtai claimed that three thieves broke in and robbed them. They pointed out Shen A'er, a Jiangbei resident living at No. 4, Lane 19, Aiwenyi Road, and Zhou A'gen, a Jiangbei resident (both carriage drivers) at No. 3, Guangyuli, Pingjili Road, as accomplices. The detectives apprehended Shen and Zhou at their addresses. During interrogation, they denied being involved in the theft and claimed they were falsely accused. After a thorough investigation by the detectives, it was discovered that the robbery was actually a conspiracy between Xu Jiashi's driver Xu Longtai and the servant He Ban. They deliberately broke the glass and falsely claimed they were robbed, accusing Shen and Zhou to shift blame and evade responsibility. The detectives arrested Xu and He. Yesterday, they were brought before the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer Lu Shouxi stated that the police investigation into the criminal conduct of the two defendants, Xu Longtai and He Ban, still required further investigation, requesting a postponement of the trial. Regarding the two defendants, Shen and Zhou, the police investigation confirmed they had no connection to the case and were falsely accused, requesting their immediate release to avoid harming innocent people. Judge Li Changnian briefly questioned the defendants and ordered a postponement of the trial to the 15th. Shen A'er and Zhou A'gen were released, while Xu Longtai and He Ban were detained pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Doctor and Female Servant</h3>
<p>Servant's Husband Accuses Wife of Elopement</p>
<p>Also Accuses Doctor of Seduction</p>
<p>Court Rules Case Inadmissible</p>
<p>Doctor to Counter-Sue for False Accusation</p>
<p>Yuan Weichen, a 50-year-old Wuxi native residing at No. 120, Xinbaren Lane, Taopeng Road, Yangshupu, recently hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing his wife, Yuan Shi (51-year-old Wuxi native), of adultery with Cao Tiyin (also known as Cao Qijing, a doctor residing at No. 645, Baker Road), a native of Suzhou, and of eloping, taking clothing, jewelry, and bankbooks worth over 3,300 silver dollars. The court had previously conducted a preliminary hearing, but due to the defendant's absence, the hearing was postponed. It has now been learned that the defendant, Cao Tiyin, has hired three lawyers, Wu Zhiping, Peng Qi, and Lin Dawen, to file a defense with the Special Court. The defense statement claims that Yuan Weichen falsely accused him of seduction and elopement. Cao Tiyin is from a prominent Suzhou family and has practiced medicine in Shanghai for many years. He has always upheld moral principles. He received a newspaper clipping from a friend reporting the above allegations. Among the seven or eight male and female servants employed in Cao Tiyin's household, there are also two female servants with the surname Yuan. One of them is around 50 years old, a native of Wuxi, and was recommended by a broker named Hu from Aiwenyi Road. She has been employed for about a year or so. It is unclear whether she is the "old wife" Yuan Weichen mentioned. Cao Tiyin has practiced medicine in Shanghai for many years and enjoys a good reputation. His residence is well-known to the people of Shanghai. The female servant named Yuan was recommended by a broker, so there was no question of seduction. The broker can be summoned for questioning, and there are other male and female servants in Cao Tiyin's household who can also be called as witnesses. Yuan Weichen's claim that he did not know Tiyin's address and that Tiyin seduced his wife and caused her to elope is clearly a false accusation and he should be sued separately. Yesterday afternoon, this case was scheduled for a continued hearing. The defendants, Cao Tiyin and Yuan Sunshi, both appeared in court. The plaintiff, Yuan Weichen, stated that Yuan Sunshi is his wife, whom he married in his hometown of Wuxi in November of the 29th year of the Guangxu Emperor. They have three sons, the eldest of whom is deceased. On September 16th of the 19th year of the Republic, she suddenly ran away, taking with her 460 silver dollars in cash, a bankbook worth 286 dollars, and jewelry, silverware, and clothing worth over 3,000 dollars. He searched for her for two years without success. It was not until last month that he accidentally encountered Yuan Shi on the road and secretly followed her, seeing her enter Cao Tiyin's home, thus revealing the truth. He requested the recovery of the stolen items and wanted her to return home, but regarding the charges against Cao Tiyin, he indicated he could drop them. The court asked if he had any evidence to prove the stolen items. Yuan replied that he could not provide any evidence. Yuan Sunshi testified that her husband did not provide food and lodging and abused her, forcing her to leave. Therefore, she left in October of the year before last, first staying with her sister. In January of last year, her sister sent her to the Hu broker, who recommended her to the Cao family as a servant. However, she did not take any belongings with her when she left. Now she does not want to go back and is willing to work as a servant in another household to avoid the cold and abuse. The witness, the Hu broker, also testified that he indeed recommended the woman to the Cao family as a servant. Cao Tiyin stated that he has practiced medicine in Shanghai for many years. He has many family members, including sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren, so he employs many servants. Last year, because his third granddaughter was being weaned, he hired Yuan Sunshi through the broker to take care of her granddaughter. He denied any seduction or assistance in elopement, stating it was a false accusation. Before the lawyers of both parties could begin their arguments, Judge Huang Risheng ruled in court that the case was inadmissible. Yuan Sunshi was ordered to provide a surety who could be summoned at any time. The portion of the accusation regarding the false accusation will be prosecuted separately.</p>
<h3>Robbers Arrested Mid-Robbery</h3>
<p>One Thief Attempts to Resist Arrest with a Gun</p>
<p>Detective Liu Apprehends Him</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 1:00 AM, detectives Liu Changgen and Wang Jinsheng of the Yangshupu Police Station learned that a large group of robbers was passing through Huade Road, intending to rob residents of their property somewhere. They reported this to the police chief, who, together with Western detectives, prepared weapons and waited there. After some time, Wang Chunlin, Zhang Jingen, Zhu Xiaomao, Lu Lianqing, Shi Mincai, and Qu Azhu, all from Tongzhou, arrived one after another. Another thief, seeing that the plan was exposed, hid in the undergrowth and attempted to resist arrest with a gun. Detective Liu noticed him and shot him in the buttocks, causing him to fall to the ground and be captured. He identified himself as Xu A'gen. A pistol and six bullets were found on his person. Wang and the others were taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, the wounded thief was sent to the police hospital for treatment. At 9:00 AM, Wang and the other six were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the case still required further investigation and requested a postponement. The gun and bullets were presented for inspection. The Chinese and Western detectives explained the circumstances of the arrest. After Judge Shen Bingrong questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be remanded in custody. The wounded thief Xu A'gen will be further examined after he recovers from his injuries.</p>
<h3>Water Bill Exceeds Rent</h3>
<p>Property Association Asks Public Works Department to Notify Water Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association has sent a letter to the Director General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement regarding water bills exceeding rent. The letter reads: "According to a letter from our member, Shanji Real Estate Agency, they have eleven city buildings on Songpan Road, numbered 82 to 1000. The monthly rent collected is 224 silver dollars. When water was charged at a flat rate, the monthly water bill was 17.40 silver dollars. However, after installing a water meter, the Shanghai Water Company demanded 236.94 silver dollars for the period from September 28th to October 28th, exceeding the rental income. This is shocking. When asked at the Jiangxi Road office, they said there was a leak in a certain section of the underground pipeline. According to Shanghai custom, after water pipes are installed, they must be inspected and approved by a Shanghai Water Company specialist before use. The buildings were completed last spring and are less than two years old. There should be no rust in the underground water pipes. If the water leak is a fact, then the Shanghai Water Company should be fully responsible. It is clear. We are reporting this to you and requesting that you negotiate with the Shanghai Water Company to find a mutually beneficial solution. According to this, your department has taken this case seriously and is working to find a mutually beneficial solution. We are sending this letter for your reference and requesting that you notify the water company."</p>

<h3>Pudong Telephone Branch to be Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has long been preparing to establish a Pudong branch, but has been unable to realize it due to various factors. Previously, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Utilities Bureau had an expired contract with the China and Foreign Telephone Company and the Shanghai Telephone Company. All telephones installed by the company and its successor, the Shanghai Telephone Company, in various districts of Pudong have also been removed. The bureau submitted a request to the municipal government to forward it to the Ministry of Communications, requesting the immediate allocation of materials to complete the project as soon as possible, so that residents could have access. The Ministry of Communications has replied that the internal components of the Pudong branch have already been installed. However, due to the Shanghai Incident, some of the pole materials were used to restore important telephone lines in the Shanghai area, which resulted in the project not being completed on schedule. The agency is currently reviewing and ordering the necessary supplementary materials. Once the materials are purchased, the project will continue. In view of this, the completion of the Pudong branch should not be far off.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Provides Relief to Disaster Victims in Panjiwan, Northern Shanghai</h3>
<p>The disaster victims on Panjiwan Road and Xinlu Road in northern Shanghai suffered greatly during the January 28th Incident.

<h3>Robbers Raid Nunnery at Night</h3>
<p>Bandits Resist Arrest by Firing Two Shots</p>
<p>Police Apprehend One Robber</p>
<p>| Jade Horse, Jade Vase, Ruby Intact |</p>
<p>| Why Wear Jewelry If You're a Nun? |</p>
<p>At 3:30 AM yesterday, six robbers suddenly arrived at Wanfu Nunnery on Datong Road in Zhabei. Two robbers wore long gowns, and two robbers each carried a pistol. They removed the bamboo fence from the back, dug through the wall, and entered the nunnery. At that time, the nuns were all asleep. When they saw the robbers, they dared not make a sound. Later, one nun named Shan Quan took advantage of the fact that the robbers were searching and secretly ran out of the door to report to the Taiyang Temple Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. Officer Wen Jiacong immediately dispatched Sergeant Nie Dexiang and Zhu Liming to lead all the police officers to search for the robbers. When the robbers heard the police, they fled in a group. They fired two shots along the way. Five robbers escaped to the Jiagun Guildhall and disappeared. However, one of the robbers heard that the police were searching and hid in the bamboo fence behind the nunnery. When the police had gone far away, he walked out of the bamboo fence to escape. By chance, Zhao Zhenqing, a police officer from post number 41, happened to be passing by after finishing his shift. He heard footsteps inside the bamboo fence and hid nearby. When the robber came out, he was immediately apprehended. A gold bracelet, a jade horse, a jade vase, a ruby gold ring, a silver rouge box, and a five-cent Fujian coin were found in his pocket. A silver hook was also found on his person. When asked about the origin of these items, he evaded the question, knowing that they were stolen. He was immediately taken to the nunnery for questioning, where the nuns identified the items as theirs. The apprehended robber was taken to the police station, where he confessed that his name was Wu Da, a native of Jiangbei. He was immediately sent to the Fourth District for transfer to the detective team to arrest the remaining accomplices. According to the nuns, there were only a few nuns in their nunnery besides the abbess Yuandao, including Shan Quan and Zhijian. They said, "We are originally monks and don't have anything of value. However, there is a nun who practices with her hair, named Xinzhen. She brought several pieces of jewelry, such as two gold rings, a silver watch, a gold ear pick, and two scarves, which were all taken away by the robbers." The losses totaled more than 1,000 silver dollars. They then led the way to the back to see that the robbers had entered through a hole in the wall under the window of the back hall. The east side of the nunnery is adjacent to the Taiyang Temple. Although there is a bamboo fence around the back of the building, there is open space outside the fence, so the robbers were able to sneak in and rob.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Stamp Tax Conference Closed Yesterday</h3>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax Conference, which began the day before yesterday, has lasted for three days. All the proposals have been reviewed and passed, and the meeting has been concluded separately. As the heads of the branch offices have been away from their offices for a long time, which may affect tax collection, the conference was brought forward and closed yesterday.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Public Library to Move</h3>
<p>New Location Above Biefa Bookstore</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Public Library is moving because its current location (near Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road) is not very suitable. The Public Works Department has been looking for a new location. The Director of the Public Works Department reported to the Library Committee that the former site of the Asian Society and the Yokohama Specie Bank were unsuitable. Although the lower level of the building on the north bank of Suzhou Creek was available, the committee members considered it unsuitable because the location was too remote. Currently, the only available location is the upper level of the Biefa Bookstore at No. 22 Nanjing Road. The rent is 500 taels per month, and a lease can be signed for five years, with an option to renew with an increase in rent of no more than one-quarter. However, a toilet needs to be added, at a cost of approximately 2,000 taels, which must be paid by the Council. It is also necessary to add partitions, but the landlord can cover 750 taels of this cost. If the location becomes insufficient in the future, the rooms on the third floor can also be rented. The current library building has a monthly rent of 700 taels, and the lease expires at the end of April next year. The library can move to the new location above Biefa Bookstore in May. After discussion, the committee members agreed that the location of Biefa Bookstore was central, and the size and rent were also suitable. They advocated signing a five-year lease immediately, with the Council paying for the necessary renovation costs. This proposal was adopted by the Board of Directors on the 7th.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit for Trademarked Elegant Cream (雅霜) for Recovery of Losses</h3>
<p>The Elegant Cream (雅霜) skincare product distributed by the Dalu Pharmacy at 120 Henan Road, Guangdong Road, in the British Concession has been sold nationwide for over a decade, and its business is quite developed. Unexpectedly, it was recently coveted by criminals who manufactured counterfeit Elegant Cream and sold it in the market by mixing it with the real product. After the pharmacy learned about this, Fan Hefu, the manager, found out that the counterfeiting operation was located at No. 50, Tongkang Lane, Min Ti Ni Yin Road in the French Concession. He immediately reported it to the Songshan Road Police Station, who dispatched detectives Xu Desheng, Bao Tan Xie Guangming, and Guo Bingquan to the address. They seized seven dozen counterfeit Elegant Cream products, a large basket of trademark papers, and four baskets of empty bottles from a certain address on Yaozhu Road. They arrested Zhou Jiazhen, Chen Dayou, and Yang Liangqing on the spot and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Second Special Court, Second Criminal Division. The police station's lawyer, Yao Zhaodi, explained the case and stated that further investigation and arrests were needed and requested an extension of the interrogation. Later, Fan Hefu, the manager of the Dalu Pharmacy, stated that his store's Elegant Cream (雅霜) products were sold widely every year, but after being counterfeited, sales suddenly plummeted. Now that the perpetrators have been identified, he has reported them to the police station for arrest and requests a trial. Since the merchant has suffered considerable losses, he requests compensation for the losses and further statements were made by his agent lawyer, Wu Qinsun, generally saying the complainant had filed a trademark with the Trademark Bureau, proof could be granted for incidental private prosecution, etc. When questioning Zhou Jiazhen, he stated that he was a broker and that the Elegant Cream was brokered to him by Yang Liangqing from his uncle’s place. He was unaware of the counterfeiting. Yang Liangqing stated that his uncle Yang Leshan, who is now on the run, asked him to sell the Elegant Cream. He said that his uncle said he bought it from a tea party, so they sold it on his behalf over one hundred bottles, later when they knew it was fake, it was stopped with excuses. Chen Dayou stated that although he and Zhou Jiazhen jointly rented a house, he had no knowledge of the sale of counterfeit goods. After Judge Wu verified the confession, he ordered the defendants to be detained and the trial postponed.</p>

<h3>Desperate for a Flower Arrangement, Someone Steals the Rope from a Hanging Woman</h3>
<p>At 119 Hefeng Lane, Lujiazui, Pudong, at 3:30 PM yesterday, it was discovered that Liu Zhu, a woman from Zhenjiang living at that address, had hanged herself on the bamboo clothesline in the front building. After being cut down, she was already beyond resuscitation. The hanging rope was then found to be missing. It is said that someone stole it to use for a flower arrangement. The deceased was 49 years old, with bound feet. Her husband's name was Liu Youxiang, who has been unemployed for a long time. Her son's name is Dehong, who works as a long-term worker in the fine yarn section of the Nihua Yarn Factory. According to Dehong, the cause of her suicide was economic hardship.

<h3>Pan Yi Commits Suicide in a Hotel</h3>
<p>Pan Yi, a 36-year-old man from Jiangxi, recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing and checked into a hotel. He took room 110 upstairs. It is unknown why, but he suddenly had the idea of dying. He swallowed raw opium the night before. By noon yesterday, he had not gotten up. The tea servant, following routine, went to inquire about whether the room was still occupied, but there was no response for a long time, which was suspicious. Therefore, he pried open the door and entered the room. He saw Pan Yi lying on the bed, dead and without breathing. He immediately informed the hotel and notified the Laozha Police Station, who ordered Detective No. 621 to come to the scene. He transported the body to Renji Hospital and then to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>A Young Woman Dies Pitifully</h3>
<p>The Swallows of the French Concession Disappear</p>
<p>A Young Woman with No Way to Sell Fruit</p>
<p>Cai, a young woman from Suzhou living at 126 Bulin Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, was 28 years old. Since her husband had passed away a long time ago, and she had an elderly mother and a young child to care for, her life was difficult. She carried a basket every day selling fruit in the various entertainment venues frequented by prostitutes. It was enough to make a living. However, since the strict prohibition of opium and gambling this spring, the various entertainment venues have closed one after another, and she has had no way to make a living. Unable to find a way to make money, she swallowed raw opium in secret the night before. She was taken to Renji Hospital, but due to an overdose, medical treatment was ineffective, and she died at 1:30 AM the next morning.</p>
<h3>Death from Alcohol Poisoning</h3>
<p>Ji Hanhe, a 24-year-old man from Tongzhou, and his brother, Ji Guiyu, both lived at 15 Chengdan Lane, Maike Li Road. The night before, Hanhe ate and drank alone outside. He did not return home until after 10:00 PM. At that time, he had drunk too much, became very drunk, and vomited continuously. His brother worked as a servant for a Westerner and had to return home late every day. That night, he did not return home until after 2:00 AM. He saw what his brother had vomited and knew that he had drunk a lot. He wiped it away for him. Then, he went to bed with him. The next morning, Hanhe had suddenly died, but his brother was still fast asleep and unaware. Later, an old woman named Wang, a neighbor, came to his house intending to ask Hanhe to write a letter, but she saw him lying stiffly on the bed, his hands and feet cold. She called out to him, but there was no response. Knowing that he had died, she woke up his brother, who went to the Huishan Police Station and ordered a detective to go to investigate. They took the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Philan Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was requested to send Prosecutor Guo Wei to the office to examine the body and determine the cause of death. According to the testimony of the deceased's brother, Ji Guiyu, who was 20 years old, when he came home, he saw his brother sleeping on the bed and vomiting. He wiped away the vomit for him. However, his brother was very clear-headed and talked and laughed with him as usual. Then, he went to sleep. His brother had no grudges with anyone outside, and he himself had nothing unpleasant to say. After Guo examined the body and determined that Ji Hanhe had died from alcohol poisoning before his death, he ordered his brother, Ji Guiyu, to sign a guarantee and take the body back for burial.</p>
<h3>Traffic Problems in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's Traffic Committee held a meeting on the 25th of last month to make decisions on several issues regarding traffic and parking on roads within the concession. All agreed measures were submitted to the Board of Directors on the 7th of this month for resolution. The various issues are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Parking Light Markers for Public Buses: At the request of Modern Advertising Company, to install illuminated signs at public bus stops and to use them for advertising needs. The police department and public works department believe that this is not suitable, as their establishment will further obstruct and crowd the sidewalks. Therefore, the committee decided to reject the request. A committee member asked whether the signs could be erected in less congested areas. The police chief replied that the existing public bus signs are sufficient to guide the public and there is no need to change.</p>
<p>Taxi Stands on the Bund: Xiang Sheng Automobile Company requested that a certain location on the Bund be designated specifically for the company's taxis to park in order to facilitate the embarkation and disembarkation of ship passengers and is willing to pay fees to obtain this benefit. After consideration by the committee, it was considered that this move would become a patent and it would be inconvenient to approve it. However, for the convenience of ship passengers who are new to this city, it seems appropriate to allocate a location on the Bund for eight or ten taxis to park. The police chief said that such a measure would likely lead to passengers fighting for passengers, raising fares, and arbitrary crowding, and that passengers currently do not feel much inconvenience in hiring cars. The chairman of the committee then suggested that the matter be referred to the police chief for further research and report on various points, and then decide. Also, if it is implemented in the future, it may be possible to contact the taxi industry association to discuss implementation methods.</p>
<p>No Parking Symbols on the Side of the Road: The committee previously resolved to replace the current red paint on the side of the road where parking is prohibited with black and white ceramic tiles. Therefore, the police chief proposed that Articles 28 and 48 of the traffic regulations should be amended and a sentence should be added to Article 28, prohibiting vehicles from parking within 30 feet of any road corner and prohibiting parking along the roadside at the point where there is a platform in the middle of the road. This amendment has been passed by the investigator.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Overtaking on Jing'an Temple Road: A committee member suggested that the current regulations prohibit cars from overtaking other vehicles east of Rue Say Zoong (静安寺路) on Jing'an Temple Road. This was because the section of the old Summer Pique Academy was very narrow. Now that the section has been widened, he suggested that Rue Say Zoong (孚路) be changed to Huo Road (霍路) to the east. The committee members expressed sympathy for this suggestion and asked the police department to conduct further research and report on the traffic settings before making a decision. The committee stated that it had recently seen that passengers alighting from the tram in front of the Zhaoxie Bridge General Assembly Hall were in considerable danger. The police chief replied that there was no platform at that location, and the parking location was too close to the roadside. When cars passed, it was inevitable that those alighting from the tram would be in danger. It is proposed to hand this matter over to the traffic section for handling, discuss it with the tram company, and move the station slightly to the east or west. A report will be made to the committee after it is completed.</p>
<h3>Cheng Zida Passed Away</h3>
<p>Cheng Zida of Ningxiang, also known as Shi Fa Ju Shi, was a famous poet, calligrapher, and painter of today. He sought refuge at sea and maintained his integrity in poverty. He had poetry gatherings with the late Zhang Taiyan, Chen Sanli, Zheng Xiaoxu, and other gentlemen for several years. He suffered from illness for several months this year. Recently, due to the severe cold, he suddenly passed away on the morning of yesterday. The funeral is scheduled for this afternoon at 95 Xiangfu Lane, Carter Road.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Gentleman Zhu Songxi Buried</h3>
<p>The late Zhu Songxi, a gentleman from Zhejiang in Shanghai, passed away this spring. His coffin has been temporarily placed in his ancestral hall in his hometown. He was admired for his generosity and philanthropy during his lifetime. Therefore, many charitable organizations have presented him with plaques. It is reported that he will be buried in Shixia Town on the 13th of this month. His descendants have built a memorial hall, which has been completed. It is expected that many relatives and friends will attend the ceremony at that time.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Office to Relocate</h3>
<p>The Bank of Communications office on Jing'an Temple Road is moving because the current building is insufficient for the expanding business. It has found a new three-story Western-style building at the west end of Pentang Lane, Nanjing Road, which is the former site of the Continental Bank branch. It is currently being renovated and is scheduled to move in after the New Year. It is reported that Liu Xueqi, who is transferred from headquarters, has been internally appointed to fill the position of manager. Mr. Liu is shrewd and capable and has served in the Bank of China and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank for many years. He has a wealth of experience. The bank is confident in its future business development and is very pleased to have found a suitable person.</p>
<h3>The Morality Society Distributes Thunderstrike Powder and Longevity Pills</h3>
<p>The China Morality Society on Taibian Road produces Jade Pivot Thunderstrike Powder and Longevity Pills, which are effective in treating seasonal epidemics, meningitis, and various dangerous and complicated diseases. They are especially effective in treating milder symptoms such as fever, sore throat, measles, heart and chest discomfort, and dizziness. Since distribution began, countless lives have been saved. It is feared that people in society are not yet aware of this. Therefore, it is specially noted to inform those who are suffering from the same ailments. Regardless of the distance, requests sent by mail will be sent immediately.</p>

<h3>Reader's Advisory</h3>
<p>㈠ Discussion Regarding Mr. Li Tianfang's Questions</p>
<p>How to Solve the Problem of Children's Education</p>
<p>Mr. Yuru suggests doing one's best within one's means. When resources are exhausted, one can only have them choose a suitable profession based on their studies. Anxiety is useless, and suicide is especially foolish.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Chifo suggests ㈠ Mr. Li's personal problem can be solved through "self-education" or siblings teaching each other. Not everyone needs to attend school, because many school subjects are impractical. It would be better to learn useful sciences at home. ㈡ Children in the education sector should be exempt from tuition fees. This is something the authorities should pay attention to. Mr. Wu Biezhi suggests changing the current economic system because once the economic system is reformed, the superstructure based on the economy, that is, the social system, will naturally be reformed. The educational difficulties raised by Mr. Li will naturally be resolved along with the entire social problem.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Ying suggests ㈠ Since Mr. Li's eldest son is already in his second year of university and his eldest daughter is in her third year of middle school, they should have sufficient self-study abilities. Furthermore, the daughter's strong desire to study shows she is an ambitious woman. If Mr. Li cannot afford their tuition fees, it would be better for either of them to take up a profession, or both of them to take up a profession at the same time. In this way, while working, they can study, and the newly acquired knowledge in experience will naturally be more practical and concrete. ㈡ Mr. Li said, "I have served in the education sector for more than ten years, and I always encourage people to study, but while teaching other people's children, my own children are constantly threatened with dropping out of school." Viewing studying and occupation, school and dropping out, as two separate things naturally leads to such a statement. One should know that taking a job does not necessarily mean one cannot study, and being in school does not necessarily mean one will not drop out. Just look at the schools now to understand.</p>

<h3>Fourth Teaching Points</h3>
<p>(1) The selection of materials should be suitable for the needs of children, and should also take into account the level and ability of children.</p>
<p>(2) Within the possible scope, it should be linked with labor, nature, society, etc. to form a whole unit of teaching. For example, ㈠ In the design of food, teach the placement, arrangement, color scheme, and special pattern problems of food tables. ㈡ In the design of clothing, teach the pattern problems related to clothing, hats, shoes, and various clothing materials. ㈢ In the design of housing, teach the pattern problems of architectural styles, room arrangements, furniture equipment, and selection. ㈣ In the design of earth, bamboo, wood, and metal crafts, teach the pattern problems related to boxes, baskets, cups, dishes, and pots. In the design of transportation, teach the pattern problems related to boats, cars, bridges, and roads. ㈥ In the design of the printing industry, teach the pattern problems related to books, newspapers, magazines, calendars, cards, posters, and other printed materials. The above designs can be combined in each year, and the application of fine arts principles can be sought from these designs to increase the experience of beauty, cultivate artistic vision, distinguish between good and bad, and have the ability to select items and arrange the environment. This will show the effectiveness of fine arts teaching.</p>
<p>(3) The expression of fine arts can fully utilize leaves, grass leaves, petals, seeds, bird feathers, fish scales, shells, butterfly wings, silkworm excrement, sand, broken ceramic pieces, etc. to arrange into extremely interesting art products in the application of painting and cutting and pasting. This is more suitable for rural primary schools. (4) Works by famous artists (famous paintings, famous engravings, fabric samples, cover paintings and advertisements for books and newspapers, illustrations in novels (such as comic paintings and satirical paintings), postal paintings, calendars, and various ceramics and lacquerware are all good materials for appreciation and research. They should be fully collected and used as much as possible.</p>
<p>(5) Within the possible scope, a fine arts room that is convenient for teaching fine arts should be equipped according to the level and needs of children, and the artisticization of the school environment should also be attempted within the possible scope. However, fine arts teaching, such as appreciation of nature, fine arts visits and exhibitions, and sketching outside the school (for senior grades), is not limited to being done in the classroom.</p>
<p>(6) Appreciation is an important activity of this subject. Children should be enlightened to appreciate it at any time according to their level and needs. At the beginning of each teaching, a descriptive speech or poems and well-known names or questions that can stimulate emotions and inspire imagination should be used to arouse children's motivation to appreciate. When children pay attention to appreciation, in addition to simple explanations to supplement imagination, questions about the knowledge and painting methods in the picture should not be discussed in detail. However, senior grades can also start with appreciation and end with research (painting methods and sculpting methods, etc.). The lives and anecdotes of Chinese and foreign artists, and poems describing art, can also be provided according to the object being appreciated.</p>
<p>(7) Expression is a tool to enrich appreciation, cultivate expression, and creativity. When teaching, attention should be paid to pattern realism and free expression, but when necessary, finished works should also be fully provided as reference materials for expression.</p>
<p>(8) The granting of technology should be when children feel that this technology is needed 丨丨 Because of the lack of this technology, they feel that they are lacking or have difficulties, and the need to learn this technology will naturally arise. (9) The mastery of a technology should be guided in various changing ways according to the age of the children.</p>
<p>(10) Expression must have results to satisfy children's expectations and arouse their interest in learning. Therefore, primary schools should not adopt things that are too difficult to do, or that take a lot of time and effort to succeed. Teachers should provide appropriate guidance when children express themselves in painting to make it easy for them to succeed.</p>
<p>(11) The purpose of research is to enhance the degree of appreciation and recognition, and to solve the difficult problems encountered during appreciation and expression. When teaching, it should be based on children's understanding ability and needs, starting from appreciation and production operations, and should provide more reference materials and avoid abstract explanations.</p>
<p>(12) The painting of expression should be mainly in color (use a hard pen first, then a soft pen. Non-economic lack or other unavoidable reasons shall not use monochrome, 丨 If monochrome painting is unavoidable, the operation of appreciation and research must still be fully colored.</p>
<p>(13) There should be a design for fine arts exhibitions in schools, exhibiting children's works and fine arts toys collected by children, etc., to encourage children's interest in fine arts.</p>
<p>(14) Children's work quantity tables should be used as much as possible to allow children to know their technical progress.</p>
<p>(15) Paintings commonly seen in society, as well as all clothing, food, housing, and transportation items containing patterns, can be criticized for their advantages, disadvantages, beauty, and ugliness with a research attitude, so that children can love beauty and hate ugliness, design improvements, 丨 This is a major task of fine arts teaching.</p>
<p>(16) Children should be taken to local fine arts exhibitions and scenic spots and other places related to fine arts for appreciation and research to increase children's experience. (End)</p>

<h3>Job Teaching Society's 15th Anniversary Solicitation for News</h3>
<p>Each Team's Fierce Progress</p>
<p>Since the start of the Chinese Vocational Education Society's current solicitation, it has been over a month. There are still two weeks left until the end. The captains of each district and team are enthusiastic and hardworking in their work, despite the turbulent times and busy official duties. As of now, the teams in the Shanghai district with the most achievements are Zhu Yinjiang, Wu Yunzhai, and Xu Yuanfang. However, the exact numbers are still unwilling to be disclosed. The top three places outside Shanghai are Fujian, Guangzhou, and Zhenjiang. However, other places such as Nanjing, Suzhou, Jinan, and Hangzhou are not weak either. The captains of the Shanghai supplementary teams met at Yizhixiang Teahouse the day before yesterday. Those who attended were all leaders of Shanghai's national product factories, such as Zhang Kang, Xi Guan, Sun Hongcheng, Pan Lifu, Xu Guanqun, Xu Yangnan, Pei Weimin, Qian Mengmei, Fang Yexian, Ren Shi, Hu Xiyuan, Wang Xiven, and forty others. Shi Liangcai chaired the meeting and gave a welcome speech. Jiang Wenyu and Pan Yangyao reported on the situation of the society. Huang Renzhi and Bai Sen gave speeches on the difficulties of Chinese industry and the necessity of educational industry, which resonated with everyone. In addition, the team leaders in Suzhou are also working very hard. Soochow University specifically sent the society's Deputy Director Yang Weiyu to give a speech. According to Principal Yang Yongqing and Academic Director Pan Shenming of the school, at least two teams can be formed.</p>
<h3>㈦ Pan Lai (England)</h3>
<p>Pan Lai can be listed again; his performance in the Davis Cup was very good. He lost to Borotra in Berlin. In the fifth set, he failed after leading 5-1. He won in Los Angeles and San Francisco. In many of the matches he lost, he could have won in five sets.</p>
<h3>㈧ Kramm (Germany)</h3>
<p>Kramm is ranked eighth because he won the German National Championship and defeated Austin in the Davis Cup.</p>
<h3>㈨ Crawford (Australia)</h3>
<p>It's a little difficult to determine the last two. Crawford is having a successful time, but when he plays, his serves fail completely, exposing his weakness.</p>
<p>Austin (England)</p>
<p>It's hard to decide. Austin reached the final at Wimbledon. His performance against Sato a few days ago was unsurpassed. Although Sato once protested that the grass was too wet, his tenth place is entirely due to his Wimbledon performance. However, the results vary throughout the year; he lost twice in Berlin and was severely defeated by Sedgwick in America.</p>

<p>Last Night's West Qing Basketball Game: Chizhi Lost to John</p>
<p>32 to 36 | Success Falls Short</p>
<p>Pirates Win Again | A Great Defeat of Jinan</p>
<p>Tonight's Three Matches</p>
<p>Chizhi basketball team lost to John by a score of 32 to 36 in the West Qing basketball game last night, a difference of four points. Although Chizhi is composed entirely of veteran players, their golden age has passed. John's performance was excellent, which led to the victory. In the second game, Pirates remained the undefeated champion, defeating Jinan by a score of 38 to 19.</p>
<p>John narrowly defeats Chizhi</p>
<p>Based on recent results, the difference between John and Chizhi is minimal. The lucky one wins. In the first half last night, although John won by four points with a score of 18 to 14, the situation was even. John took the lead with 8 to 4, followed by a tie of 8 to 8, 9 to 9. In the second half, John gradually gained momentum, making it 22 to 18. However, at this time, the general Hou Xuemin was penalized for four fouls and sent off, so Chizhi took the opportunity to attack. Sure enough, wherever the army went, Chizhi took the lead with 29 to 26. John fought hard and tied the score at 30 to 30, but success fell short. The main player Yang Lin was also penalized for four fouls and sent off, the formation was shaken, and the situation was suddenly chaotic. John won with a score of 36 to 32.</p>

<p>Pirates Win Again Over Jinan</p>
<p>The West Qing Pirates are still the most tenacious. Jinan was no match for them. Although they tried their best to resist, they ultimately formed a one-sided situation. However, after this resistance, it was more difficult for the Pirates to score. Although Jinan only scored 9 points in the first half, the Pirates' record was only 19. The total result was 38 to 19.</p>

<p>Commercial News, Finance, and Gold Market Continue to Decline</p>
<p>(Six-Tael After-Hours Trading)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the downward trend continued. The intraday trading range was around 6 taels, fluctuating around 790 taels. Industry sentiment was unstable, resulting in a further decline of 1.5 taels compared to the day before yesterday. The market opened weakly, mainly due to the continuous rise of the silver market and exchange rates. Sellers actively broke the 790-tael mark. Later, the US exchange rate weakened and then strengthened, and the swap rate increased. It was learned that the spot goods shipped from various ports were all re-exported overseas, resulting in a shortage of goods in Shanghai. Consequently, the benchmark price was boosted by 5-6 taels. The downstream market initially firmed up, but then Indian exchange rates contracted, and buyers became active again, pushing prices higher.</p>
<p>(Early Trading Down 5 Taels)</p>
<p>The market opened in January, down 5 taels, at 790 taels and 8 qian. However, sellers were active. Fuchang, Fuyu, Dadecheng, and others were the first to sell, followed by a further decrease of over 3 taels. The US dollar exchange rate for December was 375, January 4375, and March could be settled at 6875, resulting in a drop to 87 taels and 8 qian. Suddenly, Bingxing, Fuyu, Yuanhengyuan, and others started buying, immediately pushing the price up to 90 taels and 9 qian. When the HSBC exchange rate was announced, the first order was not to change, and the US dollar was set at 3125. The domestic market in January was still 4375, and banks were willing to offer 375 for December, so the price slightly increased to 89 taels. Later, Anta, Citibank, British Chinese Bank, and others mutually traded US dollars for March at 625. Yuanmao Yong, Hongkang Yong, Zhaofeng Chang, Qianjing Xiang, Yifeng, and Yifeng Yong all rushed to buy, and because cash reserves were particularly low, the swap rate was increased by 2.5 taels. Buyers were unwilling to sell, leading to a gradual increase in the market price by more than 4 taels, reaching 93 taels and 7 qian at 11:00 AM. However, there were not many intraday trades. Subsequently, the price fell by over 1 tael and then rebounded. Bingxing, Yuanmao Yong, Futai Heng, Fuyu, and Qingfa Yong competed to buy, reaching 4.5 taels at 11:30 AM. Yifeng Yong, Hengyu, Yongfeng, and Fuyu sold at 1.8 qian at noon, and then closed at 2.4 qian.</p>
<p>(The Market Changed Repeatedly Later)</p>
<p>The market opened in the afternoon at 92 taels. Yifeng Yong and Fuchang Qingfa Yong all bought. Zhengjin absorbed US dollars for January at 375, and Mitsui absorbed US dollars for March at 5625, continuing to absorb half a yuan. At 1:15 PM, the price reached 5.5 taels. Later, because US dollars for January at 3125 could all be settled, and this month at 25, Daxing Yong, Fuyu, Dadecheng, Hongkang Yong, Yuhe, and others sold off. Mitsui also sold US dollars for January at 375, so the price plummeted, dropping by more than 6 taels, reaching 89 taels at 3:00 PM. Afterwards, Yuanmao Yong, Tianfeng Yong, Yongfeng, and Yifeng Yong all bought in again. HSBC absorbed 75 for April, Maihang absorbed 625 for March, and Anta traded British-American exchange rates at 3 yuan 2 jiao and 6 fen. However, the market price fluctuated slightly. It was later reported that the Indian cable came in slightly at 7 anna, reaching 94 taels and 7 qian at 4:00 PM. However, the exchange market was somewhat complicated and not particularly good. Subsequently, Yang Fuyu, Qianchang Xiang, and others sold off, resulting in a further decline of 2 taels. At 4:10 PM, it was 2 taels and 8 qian. Dalian gangs and Renxing Yong retail investors bought in. At the close at 4:30 PM, it was 94 taels and 3 qian, a decrease of 1.5 qian compared to the previous day. (The decline has lasted for six days, but the total amount is only over 13 taels). The maximum price for the whole day was 95 taels and 5 qian, the minimum was 87 taels and 8 qian, a difference of 7 taels and 7 qian. The red slip totaled over 12 taels and 75 (less than 8 taels).</p>
<p>(Extremely Conflicting)</p>
<p>The listed price for US dollars was again high at 3125, resulting in 853 taels, a difference of 64 taels. At noon, it was 60 taels, in the afternoon, 61 taels, and then 57 taels. The booked prices were 93 taels, 92 taels, the make-up water was 94 taels, and in the afternoon it was 96 taels. Statistical of over-the-counter transactions, Yuanmao Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, Hengchang Yong, Neixing, Yuanheng, Qianchang Xiang, Zhaofeng Chang, and Yifeng Yong all bought. Hengyu, Yuhe, and Fuyu all sold. Yuantai, Daxing Yong, Yuanchun, Futai Heng, and Hongkang Yong had many deposit and withdrawal transactions. Dadecheng套头 and customers bought and sold at times. In the afternoon, Yongfeng, Yifeng Yong, Hengchang Yong, Qingfa Yong, Shunli, Yuanmao Yong, and Tianfeng Yong all bought. Qianchang Xiang, Hengyu, Fuyu, and Hongkang Yong all sold. The Dalian gang bought a total of seven or eight hundred slips and sold more than one hundred. Guanggang had few transactions. The total amount of various slips to the previous day was about 20,450.</p>
<p>British and American Exchange Rates Varied</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market continued to rise, and exchange rates rose for three consecutive days. The British exchange rate against the US dollar rose sharply by 2 fen and 75, while the US exchange rate against the British pound rose wildly by 3 fen and a half. The HSBC exchange rate was 3125 for both British and American exchange rates. The French, Dutch, and German exchange rates also increased.

It is estimated that Chinese merchants bought about 100,000 pounds of British currency, and banks also traded recent futures in Mumbai for a considerable amount of US dollars, about 1 million. Gold merchants mostly bought recent futures because the benchmark price was stable, making套头 profits.

<p>Review of the London Silver Market</p>
<p>London, 7th - Samuel Montague Company reported that due to India's continued sale of silver on Thursday last week, the market lacked absorption capacity. Later, there were very few changes. India's continued sales offset China's purchases, stabilizing the market. The special development in the silver market now remains to be seen. The current uncertain situation is sufficient to hinder transactions in the silver market.</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Trends from Firm to Weak</p>
<p>Xinfeng Trading Company reported that on Wednesday (the 7th), the New York stock market fluctuated throughout the day, indicating that it had entered a circling state. In the morning, short positions were covered, and the British pound and grain prices strengthened, leading to a consistent rise in all stocks. Transactions in the afternoon were slightly more limited, and market conditions were no longer able to maintain their original state, so they gradually declined. As a result, there was not much difference compared to the previous day. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.2 million shares. According to the "Steel Age" magazine, the estimated steel workload for this week is 16%. The majority of the work is the manufacturing of white iron sheets. Currently, orders are gradually decreasing, and the situation in the latter half of the month is likely to worsen. It is predicted that the demand for white iron sheets next year will increase by</p>

<p>Clapping hands and strange cries suggest something unusual is capturing public attention. Driven by curiosity, I squeezed into the crowd, Sherlock Holmes-like, to investigate. Suddenly, a man in new clothes appeared, the sleeve of his right arm drenched in shiny oil, dripping and ruining his brand-new silk cotton robe. What a pity! He stretched out his hand, face flushed, seemingly ashamed, and scurried out of the dried goods store, heading away from the crowd. The people in the street erupted in laughter and shouted odd comments: "Truly practicing 'squeezing oil'," "A believer in 'squeezing oil'," "Squeezing oil's gone awry!"</p>
<p>But what exactly is this "squeezing oil" they're yelling about? Why is this man's sleeve covered in oil? And why are people mocking his misfortune instead of sympathizing? I need to find out.</p>
<p>A young clerk at the dried goods store cheerfully explained that the man was a regular customer who came in every day to sit, smoke his water pipe, and chat. He was known for his greed and opportunistic behavior, always trying to "squeeze oil" and take advantage. He would come into the store and help himself to whatever he liked, eating it right there. Because he was a regular, they usually didn't bother to argue. However, a colleague, Mr. Li, was annoyed by his greed and devised a plan to teach him a lesson, showing him that trying to get small gains could lead to bigger losses. They noticed he always helped himself to peanuts, since in this town it wasn't uncommon to eat peanuts at the store so no one ever stopped him. But he did it every single day, pretending to sit on the peanut jar while secretly reaching into it to grab peanuts. Exploiting this habit, they learned he was attending a wedding feast and would be dressed in silk and satin. So, they replaced the peanut jar with a bean oil jar, setting a trap for him. As expected, he returned from the wedding feast and stopped by to "squeeze oil." True to form, he sat on the jar, casually chatting while his hand sneaked into the jar. Suddenly, "thump!" He quickly pulled his hand back, but it was too late. His sleeve was soaked in oil, truly practicing "squeezing oil"! The whole store burst into laughter, and he, red-faced with shame, fled. This attracted a crowd of onlookers. By Sun Yuan</p>
<p>There are people who are idle and write gossip about female classmates in wall newspapers, or scandalous stories about royalty; and there are people who have nothing to do but organize associations. In our department this semester, someone initiated the establishment of the "×× Society." Of course, the constitution is the most important thing. The constitution, written in large characters, was posted on the bulletin board. The articles were always the same old routine: name, purpose, members, meeting times, staff, and, most importantly, the membership fee of one yuan per semester was always written as the penultimate clause. Three days later, Old Wang, the organizing committee member, said to Old Ye: "The female students are the most generous with their fees. All eight female students have paid, but only three or four male students have paid." A week before the inaugural meeting, a large notice was posted.</p>
<p>The meeting was scheduled to begin at two o'clock, but it was already three o'clock, and less than half of the members were present. The notice clearly stated that the meeting would begin at two o'clock, so surely no one could have made a mistake? Why were there so few people? What was especially strange was that not a single female student had arrived, and even more strange was that one of the female students was a member of the organizing committee, though she hadn't prepared anything or attended.</p>
<p>"Let them not come, we can eat more snacks," Old Zhu said with a smile, wolfing down food.</p>
<p>From that day on, the four characters "×× Society" were never seen on the bulletin board again. No one asked about it, but occasionally a classmate would jokingly ask the committee members how the society was doing.</p>
<p>"Ask Old Wang," Old Ye would say. "Ask Old Ye," Old Wang would say. The society...</p>
<p>The Chinese spirit of organization! The Chinese spirit of unity! The Struggle of Marriage By Pei Jin</p>
<p>Jian, from the next room in the common wing, has looked particularly downcast recently. The brave and heroic spirit he once possessed has been replaced by a melancholy and passive attitude. Of course, as someone who toils like a beast of burden for a living, I barely have time to worry about putting bread on the table, let alone the leisure to inquire into his affairs!</p>
<p>Last night, after dinner, we were chatting when suddenly a quarrel broke out next door. Listening closely, I realized Jian was resisting his father's arranged marriage. "Marriage? It's too early! It's not too late to talk about it when I can support myself. Besides, I'm not even twenty years old yet, so I'm still too young. Let me study properly now!" Jian seemed to earnestly plead with his father. "No! I have already discussed this with your mother. It is our duty to arrange a marriage for our son. Besides, you are already of a marriageable age, and you absolutely must not disobey me," his father threatened, pressuring Jian to agree.</p>
<p>"But, Father! To be honest, I absolutely cannot accept this old-fashioned marriage, and I am extremely unwilling to marry a stranger I have no affection for, because there is no love between us..." "I think this marriage is the best match for you, truly a case of being well-matched in social status. She is not unattractive, her personality is not bad, she has had some education, and she can manage household affairs. What is there to object to? Someone like her is exactly what our family needs!" "..."</p>
<p>"Jian! Just agree to me and stop dreaming about free love! Look at your cousin Wei, isn't he an example? Was the result happy? Didn't he and Shuzhen also freely marry? So why are they arguing for divorce now, just a year after getting married? Wake up, Jian! Stop being deluded!" "That is indeed contradictory and goes against conscience," Jian retorted. "Although they think of such rash unions as free love, as being modern people, in reality, to put it bluntly, they are enemies of love and criminals in society! I think... I won't be like that, maybe I won't be like that!" Jian retorted vigorously.</p>
<p>"I will never agree to let you choose freely. I believe it is an illegal union. Marriages are predestined from a previous life. What is there to want or not want?" "Then, according to Father's opinion, there is no room for redemption, and my aspirations are completely crushed. When the time comes, then... I... I will only... flee..." Jian's voice gradually lowered.</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>Then, he raised his voice again and said, "Father! I find it very difficult to accept this unlawful marriage!" He seemed to be weeping with extreme resentment.</p>
<p>"What! You dare to flee? You absolutely refuse to agree?" His father sighed deeply, paused for a moment, and then continued, "Disobeying parents' orders and the words of matchmakers, insisting on making acquaintances privately, alas! Truly 'people's hearts are not as they used to be,' 'the world is going downhill,' what freedom, what love!"</p>
<p>The argument finally ended vaguely like this. Listening from next door, I was filled with endless thoughts. Old rituals and doctrines are certainly evil, but is the current new situation perfect?! Perhaps the reason why the conservatives are constantly satirizing and attacking is not without cause!</p>
<p>The Difference Between Staff Communication Exchanges and Limited Partnerships</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I was delighted to learn of the establishment of the Staff Communication column in your esteemed newspaper. From now on, the business community will have a place to seek information, like a guiding light in a vast ocean! I am a mere apprentice who usually feels like I am peering over a high wall when reading newspapers and magazines. Considering that the purpose of your column is to improve the knowledge of staff and apprentices, I boldly pose a few questions, hoping to borrow your valuable time and a corner of your esteemed publication to provide answers. The questions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) How exactly do exchanges operate? What is the difference between them and auction houses?</p>
<p>(2) Chinese companies are generally divided into four types: limited, unlimited, limited partnerships, and joint-stock limited partnerships. What is the difference between limited partnerships and joint-stock limited partnerships?</p>
<p>I have read about these two points in business books, but the explanations are too simple and not easy to understand, and I did not focus on studying them at the time. Please provide a detailed and easy-to-understand explanation. I would be most grateful!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Xin Jingfu</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The two questions raised by Mr. Xin are very important. I will provide answers based on my limited knowledge, as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Both exchanges and auction houses are special venues for buying and selling. If we focus solely on "using the gavel as the final decision in a transaction" and "competitive pricing," they may seem similar. (Exchanges use relative, bidding, successive, and competitive methods of trading. Shanghai's exchanges mostly use competitive methods, which are most likely to cause confusion.) In reality, there are many differences. The main purpose of an exchange is to promote production and regulate the market, while the purpose of an auction house is solely to sell goods at the most suitable price on behalf of others. Therefore, an exchange is active and dynamic, while an auction house is passive and static. The procedures for an exchange are more complex. If using the competitive buying and selling method, a client, broker, and agent must work together under the supervision of a supervisor to begin the transaction. An auction house, on the other hand, trades directly, equivalent to relative trading at an exchange. As for the prices in an auction house, they are generally set per item, can fluctuate at any time, and the transaction is purely for the current period. This is not the case with an exchange. Each day has a morning and afternoon session, each session is divided into three or four trading periods, and each period has its own market price. At the time of the transaction, there are three types of methods: spot, forward, and futures. One more thing to note is that an auction house must display all goods one by one for people to choose and bid on, while an exchange does not need to, which leads to the phenomenon of buying and selling short. Note: There are many types of exchanges, and their operations are extremely complex. For details, please read Zhu Enliang's "Encyclopedia of Exchanges" and Tong Xianwen's "Introduction to Business" Chapter 30. It would be best to make actual observations.</p>
<p>(B) According to Article 2 of the Company Law, companies are divided into four types: 1. Unlimited Companies, 2. Limited Partnerships, 3. Limited Liability Companies, and 4. Joint-Stock Limited Partnerships. Aside from number 1, which is not related to Mr. Xin's question, I will briefly describe the meaning and differences between types 2 and 4.</p>
<p>A company formed by a mix of general partners and limited partners is called a Limited Partnership. A company formed by a mix of general partners and limited partners with shares is called a Joint-Stock Limited Partnership. The differences between these two types of companies can be observed from the following three aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Raising Capital: The general partners of a Joint-Stock Limited Partnership may not subscribe to all the shares and must leave a portion to be raised in order to avoid confusion with Unlimited Companies. However, the founders of a Limited Partnership (mostly general partners) may subscribe to all the shares themselves if they cannot raise enough shares. The capital contributed by the limited partners in a Limited Partnership is determined according to a fixed amount. In a Joint-Stock Limited Partnership, the capital is divided into a certain number of shares, which the limited partners freely subscribe to.</p>
<p>(2) Company Type: If the limited partners of a Limited Partnership are removed, it is no different from an Unlimited Company. The responsibility of some of the general partners in a Joint-Stock Limited Partnership is the same as that of the shareholders in an Unlimited Company; the responsibility of the other limited partners is no different from that of the limited partners in a Limited Partnership. Furthermore, the limited partners subscribe to the capital in shares, which is the same as in a Limited Liability Company. Therefore, a Joint-Stock Limited Partnership is truly in between all three.</p>
<p>(3) Economic Standpoint: From an economic standpoint, there is little difference between a Limited Partnership and a silent partnership (the difference being that a silent partnership is a contractual relationship, while a Limited Partnership has the status of a legal entity). As for a Joint-Stock Limited Partnership, it allows the general partners with unlimited liability and the limited partners providing capital to cooperate, which is most suitable for absorbing scattered capital into large sums to engage in great enterprises. It is considered the most appropriate of the four types of companies.</p>
<p>Novel Written for a Friend's Wife (Part 2) By Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Zhou Dajing, who used a kidnapping tactic to seize her as revenge for his heartbreak, must have taken a old-fashioned woman abandoned by the times. Her lack of intelligence and soul can be predicted without investigation." This was the extremely blunt and contemptuous assessment I had before meeting you. I never expected that this assessment would be so contrary to the facts!</p>
<p>Not only the height to which I was previously laughing at you, or your color... All the beauty of you in person surpassed Meng Fang, Dajing's former lover and our classmate, by a hundredfold; and your elegant conversation, lively demeanor, and quiet and lovely smile incontrovertibly established the highest beauty of a woman: the beauty of the soul.</p>
<p>At this point, I cannot help but admire the brilliance of Dajing's methods, to the point of being as confused as if I were in a dream. I lost my inherent lively and erratic nature, and vaguely didn't know what to say; I replaced greetings with silence, and sat on a sofa inexplicably. Five minutes, six minutes... For a long time, I finally came to my senses.</p>
<p>Ah, greatness! The greatness of female beauty! It can indeed control all men, no matter how intelligent they are.</p>
<p>I, who was as untamed as a wild horse, only then found someone who could control me, and that is you, beautiful little pig! Wasn't that how I used to call you most often? And you were happy for me to call you that. Therefore, even though I have now left and rushed into the arms of the God of War, I can never give up this wonderful epithet, which is more flavorful than anything else. I have also decided in advance that when the bullets of the Japanese invaders come as agreed and hit my heart, I must use that final moment and all my strength to shout out "Beautiful little pig!"</p>
<p>Guess, little pig, where am I now? Let me tell you! The Jinpu train, like a long snake, is carrying me towards Botou Town, less than two hundred miles from Tianjin. Probably by the time the light above my head goes out, I will definitely be able to pass Tangguantun.</p>
<p>Botou Town, Tangguantun, Tianjin, why am I going to these places that I have no connection with? Based on my profession and circumstances, there is no need for me to board the Jinpu train, but now I have not only boarded the Jinpu train, but also have to transfer from Tianjin to Beiping, and then from Beiping to Rehe, Chaoyang Temple, Nanling; maybe the advocates of non-resistance will have a day of awakening, and then maybe I will shed my blood to enter Shenyang! Lovely little friend, little pig, wait for me!</p>
<p>Remember, before the January 28th Incident broke out, I used a superficial and ridiculous perspective and a boastful mentality to express to you repeatedly with great enthusiasm that if the artillery fire of the Japanese beasts were to wreak havoc near Shanghai, I would enter this great tragedy of "blood flowing for a hundred miles and corpses lying in the tens of thousands" with a smile on my face... I even hinted at you to give me a sweet kiss before I left. Unfortunately, the Japanese beasts were not as small-minded as I had imagined. They finally staged a full-scale martial arts show in Shanghai, the commercial capital of East Asia, where the world's attention was focused; but I hid in the Public Concession under the protection of imperialists from the day the war broke out until the day the treaty was signed, spending my time idly chatting with you about the mythological war news I heard from all directions, or climbing to high places with the mentality of watching a ball game, leisurely admiring the sparks of field artillery.</p>
<p>At that time, although you never used a sarcastic word to embarrass me, I sometimes felt extremely ashamed when I examined my heart in the quiet of the night.</p>
<p>"Soulless animal!" I often cursed myself like this. That's right, at that time I had buried my entire soul in your wavy short hair!</p>
<p>However, even so, judging from my usual views and actions, you probably had to say that I am a brave, pugnacious, and irritable rascal, right? Really, beautiful little pig! Let me tell you... I am not a coward without any blood in me. If I hadn't discovered you, this gem like a night pearl, two years ago, not to mention the January 28th Incident, even during the September 18th Incident, I would have used my blood to soak our most beloved national emblem of the blue sky and white sun on the frontier long ago!</p>

<p>*Shen Bao* Local Supplement Film News</p>
<p>The Harbinger of the Return of Ufa Films By Xingfu</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Universal Film Co., Ltd. signed a five-year contract with Ufa and Ufa-Gaumont Joint Corporation, European films have launched a major offensive against the Chinese film industry. In the near future, there will be films starring Lilian Harvey, Henri Garat, Conrad Veidt, and Lil Dagover, such as *Congress Dances*; the musical comedy *Monte Carlo Madness*, starring Sari Maritza and Hans Albers; *Happy Ever After*, starring Lilian Harvey and Jacques Hornebostel, the lead actor in *Affaire Lilian Carée*; and *Storm of Passion*, starring Emil Jannings, which premiered in one hundred theaters in Paris last month to great success; and there are many other films as well.</p>
<p>According to news from Universal, the first film to be released may be *Congress Dances*. This film is not only the brainchild of film moguls Erich Pommer and Erich Charell, reaching the pinnacle of skill, but the music was also composed by the great composer Werner Heymann.</p>
<p>The story takes place in 1812 after Napoleon's defeat. Countries involved in the war agreed to hold a post-war conference in Vienna. Tsar Alexander of Russia traveled from Russia to attend the conference. He had a favorite minister named Bibikov, who looked very similar to him. The Tsar often had Bibikov disguise himself as himself to fool everyone, and in his spare time, he disguised himself as an officer to sneak out. As a result, he had a romantic affair with a young woman from a humble family. Unexpectedly, troubles arose. While a dance was being held at the conference, news came that Napoleon had landed in France. The conference attendees scattered like birds and beasts, and the Tsar left his lover and returned to Russia.</p>
<p>The above paragraph is translated from a foreign newspaper. It is used as a brief introduction to the return of Ufa films. A detailed review of the films mentioned above will have to wait until the public release.</p>
<p>Reader's Opinion: A Discussion of War Films By Qing Jun</p>
<p>From the war films we have seen, they always depict love affairs. *Hell's Angels* is one of the few exceptions, but even it has a female character. In my opinion, only *Westfront 1918*, which was recently shown at the Paris Grand Theater, can be called a "masculine film" because there isn't a single female character in it from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Moreover, the film ends with men sacrificing themselves for their country, making it a tragedy. According to literary criticism, comedy belongs to the beautiful, while tragedy belongs to the sublime. Therefore, *Westfront 1918* is undoubtedly a doubly masculine film.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, many film critics now often regard foreign war films as propaganda tools of imperialists, comparing them to "sugar-coated poison." This is undeniable. Therefore, we must urgently seek the birth of great domestic war films! Because love films are universal, there is not much harm in showing foreign films in our country. War films, on the other hand, are national. English war films naturally encourage the British people and depict British power, while German war films naturally encourage the German people and depict German power. Showing such films in our country will inevitably "inflate the arrogance of others and deflate our own morale."</p>
<p>While writing this, I cannot help but hope that our domestic film companies can create great works that "encourage national spirit" to stimulate our people. (Please transfer my payment to aid the volunteer army.)</p>
<p>Brief Film Star Reviews: Hu Die, Chen Yu Mei, Ruan Lingyu By Rui Ying</p>
<p>Hu Die, Chen Yu Mei, and Ruan Lingyu are the pillars of the Star, Tianyi, and Lianhua companies. Their acting techniques are completely different and worthy of comparison. Hu Die is the oldest of the female stars, but her style always stays at the same level. Hu Die is quite good at playing a dignified young woman, but if you ask her to play a villain, she is forced. Therefore, she was quite successful in playing He Lina in *The Smiling Proud Wanderer*, but forced in playing Shen Fengxi. Chen Yu Mei did not stand out initially in *The Orphan Girl*, but after seeing *Traces of a Lost Wild Goose*, I realized that she is progressing rapidly. Chen Yu Mei is good at playing tragic protagonists. It is best to have her play a female student and not a "virtuous wife and loving mother." Her style is somewhat similar to Lillian Gish. The expression in her eyes surpasses anyone else. A kind of melancholic and sorrowful situation can be actively translated from the screen into the hearts of the audience, which is where her success lies. Ruan Lingyu is known for her seductive expressions, which is actually not "seductive," but "lively." In one scene of Ruan Lingyu in *Wild Flowers by the Road*, I almost suspected that she was Dolores del Río in *Resurrection*. Her graceful figure and charming eyes are extremely capable of attracting young people to become fascinated by her and not want to watch any more Macdonald films. Ruan Lingyu's expressions are absolutely not "coy," but "gentle and fragrant." Recently, I heard that she will definitely change her style.</p>
<p>Small Statistics on Chinese Cinemas By Zhao Shuku</p>
<p>There are 239 cinemas in China. In 1927, there were only 106. It has more than doubled in three years. 24 major cities have cinemas. 8 of them have been showing sound films.</p>
<p>There are a total of 136,994 seats in Chinese cinemas. In 1927, there were only 68,512. It has also more than doubled in three years. In the first half of 1930, the number of feet of American films imported into China was 1,013,044, 67% of which were sound films. In the first half of 1931, the number of feet of American films imported into China was 1,015,044, 89% of which were sound films. From 1921 to 1930, 164 film companies were established in China, but only 53 of them produced films. In 1929, less than 50 films were produced. This spring, only 6 companies remained. Due to the war, most of them have been affected and are now bankrupt or reorganized.</p>
<p>There are 23 film management agencies in China, including 8 American, 2 French, 1 German, and 11 Chinese.</p>
<p>There are 53 cinemas in Shanghai, 27 of which show sound films (this statistic is from before the Shanghai Incident). After the Shanghai Incident, there are 46 cinemas (including amusement parks) that can show sound films.

<p>Introduction to Domestic Films</p>
<p>Introduction to Domestic Films: *City Nights* By Canlan</p>
<p>*City Nights* has become the only good selling material for various newspapers. There must be many people who want to know something about its content. It is the directorial debut of Fei Mu of Lianhua Company.</p>
<p>The leading roles are still played by the two pillars of Star Lianhua: Jin Yan and Ruan Lingyu. How they perform is another question, but at least it can be believed that they are confident. As for the supporting roles, almost every one of them was personally sought out by Fei Mu. Even the so-called extras were personally found one by one and were not hired from existing employment agencies. Many places in the film were shot on location, borrowing factories or other labor venues to depict the front and back sides of urban prosperity and extravagance, showing that a society of wealth and intoxication is built on the blood and sweat of the poor. Perhaps no one else has noticed this.</p>
<p>The set design in the film focuses on the lives of the poor. We can find many ordinary but extremely moving realistic depictions of the poor. Another point that is extremely noteworthy is that Mr. Fei has initiated a revolution in the film industry. Because fundamentally socialized films depict reality, he only hopes that the audience remembers a young man, an old man, a woman... and others. This is often seen in foreign films, but is an innovation in domestic films.</p>
<p>Local Investigation: The Unique Southern Film Company By Chu</p>
<p>The Southern Film Company, run by Sit Kok-sin, has been introduced in a previous publication. Speaking of Sit Kok-sin, he is not a newcomer to the film industry. I remember that five or six years ago, he had already filmed *Rogue Butterfly* in Shanghai, taking on the roles of director and lead actor himself. Because of his long history with Cantonese opera, this film also caused a stir in Hong Kong and Guangdong. In June of this year, he felt that the function of film was becoming more and more extensive. In order to make his art more widely known, he resolutely abandoned his stage life and came to Shanghai to organize the Southern Film Company.</p>
<p>This Southern Company is a unique film company. In addition to film production, it also operates other businesses. It has a printing department, specializing in printing artistic publicity pictures; a plate-making department, specializing in color and monochrome copperplate and woodcut plates; a woodworking department, specializing in manufacturing various new-style furniture; and a shipping department, acting as an agent for Hong Kong Han Yun Shipping. In addition, it has obtained the general agency rights for Shanghai and North China, representing all products of the Siwas Co., Ltd. factory in Berlin, Germany. Judging by Mr. Xue's past experience and his ability to handle affairs, the company's future is bound to be promising.</p>
<p>An Old English-American Partnership By Xiao Huozi</p>
<p>Laurel and Hardy are truly a natural pair of funny old partners. They have the magic to make your mouth laugh uncontrollably and make your stomach ache from laughing so hard! Indeed, since they partnered together in 1926, their talents have seen remarkable and astonishing developments and achievements. Laurel is only 38 years old this year, three years younger than Hardy, and weighs 130 pounds less than Hardy. He is English and started acting on stage with his parents when he was seven years old. He came to America at the age of sixteen and entered the film industry at the age of twenty-three. Hardy is American and a graduate of the law department of the University of Georgia. He has had a special love for film since very early on. He began his acting career at the age of twenty-two and has had twenty years of experience.</p>
<p>The Luck of the Extra By Xingxiu</p>
<p>Since the United Company hired several directors and male and female stars who already have a place in the film industry to go south, they will proceed to film movies. However, because it is difficult to recruit extras with camera presence in places such as Hong Kong and Guangzhou, the filming work will inevitably be very difficult. As a result, they had to come to Shanghai to invite extras. They have now invited ten people to go to Hong Kong on the eighth. They are all people from the "Matilister" area, the most famous gathering place for Shanghai film extras. The leader is Jiang Youyi, who used to be a basic actor in the Youlian Company. Before leaving, each person will receive 10 yuan for travel expenses and 30 yuan per month for wages. According to the temporary actor wage, wages are calculated according to the number of days of filming. The United Company treats these temporary actors, but they are paid a monthly salary, which already has a basic nature. Therefore, the temporary actors who were invited by the United Company this time are all overjoyed.</p>
<p>Film Scene Gossip: Do You Know? By Xiaogu</p>
<p>Chaplin spent a lot of effort giving a speech on the radio for the first time. After finishing his speech, he weighed 5 pounds lighter. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why he opposes sound films.</p>
<p>Clara Bow once received more than a hundred dogs because a reporter published a conversation saying that she liked dogs the most. So people who worship her all took dogs to give her.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple's contract with Paramount has a very unique condition: in the future, when she speaks English on the screen, she must use an accent. This means that she must speak her French English and not pure English.</p>

<p>Film Treatise: Real Laughter and Fake Laughter By Chen Dabei</p>
<p>There is no humanity in today's so-called photography scene, and compassion is not taken into consideration. Therefore, some people say that the life in the photography scene is not far from the life in the army. Your fatigue and your illness cannot attract the attention of the authorities, making them less concerned about the company's financial losses and temporarily stopping the work in progress. Unless you have become a star, you cannot enjoy such happiness.</p>
<p>For this reason, I advise you to practice smiling expressions as a habit first when practicing expressions. Practice your smile more often in front of the mirror. Being able to burst into laughter for no reason in front of the mirror more than twice a day is the best habit. After this habit is developed, not only can the damage to your body be remedied a little, but you can also get more comfort in your spirit. A person with a smiling face is always more likely to win the favor of his colleagues in the photography scene than a person with tightly locked eyebrows. After practicing real laughter, the seventh style of solo practice is to practice fake laughter.</p>
<p>Fake laughter includes malicious laughter such as sneering, mocking, and cold laughter. Although it is called laughter, it is actually similar to the arrogance and jealousy of the fifth style, but because it is similar to real laughter in the movement of facial muscles, it has to be classified as a type of laughter. Fake laughter is completely malicious. Therefore, like arrogance and jealousy, I advise you to only practice hard when you practice. After practicing, except when you need to work in front of the camera in the future, I hope you will not develop this kind of expression into a habit and affect your daily life. This kind of bad influence is exactly the opposite of the influence of real laughter mentioned above, and it is enough to make you create many enemies among your colleagues for no reason.</p>
<h3>Students of Yancang Elementary School Weep Bitterly for National Crisis</h3>
<p>Students' Weeping for National Crisis Touches All Townspeople</p>
<p>The municipal Yancang Elementary School of this city stipulated that this week would be a patriotic activity week. For the past few days, students have been deeply stimulated by teachers' teachings on the national crisis. After classes ended at 4 p.m. on the 7th, local gentry Xu Chunsheng spoke to senior students of the school, saying, "The Northeast Anti-Japanese Army under Su Bingwen has retreated. You are still young, and one day you may become slaves of a conquered nation. I am old, but I cannot help but worry for you." This spread throughout the school. Third-grade female students Chen Yinxin and Lu Cuiyun began to weep bitterly. The school principal, Sun Yougong, saw this as a great opportunity to implement patriotic education, so he gathered all the students to read Su Bingwen's telegram aloud once. Then, school staff members Ding, Xia, and Zhao Yun gave deeply sorrowful speeches, shedding tears. All the students wept bitterly at the time, and then immediately formed a procession to Gaoqiao Town to evoke touching feelings. All the townspeople were greatly moved by this scene.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Revises and Announces Rules for Reviewing Operas and Film</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, in order to review operas and film, and to establish incentive methods, revised the original review rules. Although there were provisions for incentives in the prohibited items, there was no explicit statement. Furthermore, the one yuan license fee required for obtaining a license was not something that small-scale entertainment venues could afford. Therefore, the original rules for reviewing operas and records were revised, adding three items for those who could be rewarded, and canceling the item that required applicants to pay a one yuan license fee when obtaining a license. It is reported that this has been approved by the bureau's meeting and submitted to the municipal government for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Longde Holds Subject-Specific Achievement Exhibition</h3>
<p>The municipal Longde Elementary School of this city recently held a subject-specific achievement exhibition to encourage children's studies. Achievements in subjects such as arithmetic, Chinese, and general knowledge have been presented separately. Each student's achievements are commendable, and the history, geography, charts, and diagrams are especially ingenious. It is reported that the art and kindergarten achievements will be exhibited this Saturday afternoon, and many excellent works are expected at that time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Girls' High School Invites Tao Xingzhi to Lecture</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Girls' High School in Ximen of this city has always paid attention to extracurricular activities. In addition to holding various competitions, they often invite celebrities to give lectures to enhance students' novel knowledge. Today (Friday) at 12:30 p.m., the school is borrowing the Public Education Center to invite Guanghua University professor Tao Xingzhi to give a lecture. It is reported that the school's director Chu Minyi will also come to the school to give a lecture next week, and the public is welcome to attend.</p>
<p>The Chaotic Tennis Scene of 1932</p>
<h3>On World Heroes</h3>
<p>Contradictions and Conflicts... But Vines First in the Top Ten... Without a Doubt | Reuters' Opinion |</p>
<p>London, 8th (Reuters) - To definitively analyze and determine the top ten tennis players in the world for 1932, one must acknowledge the chaotic and confused situation this year. In major events and competitions such as the American and British championships, and the Davis Cup, contradictory and conflicting results were frequently seen, with victories and defeats inconsistent and success and failure uncertain. However, in this situation, Vines should be ranked first without a doubt. Here is an analysis of the top ten players in order:</p>
<h3>㈠ Vines (USA)</h3>
<p>No one can deny Vines' position at the top. He defeated Wimbledon, and then defeated American Linsheng. No one dared to challenge him. The world champion of genius has conclusively proven himself. His serve is no less than Tilden's, and his electric topspin shots are incredibly accurate.</p>
<h3>㈡ Cochet (France)</h3>
<p>Cochet is ranked second</p>
<p>because he reached the finals</p>
<p>in the U.S. National</p>
<p>Tennis Championships.</p>
<p>This famous French general from Lyon has dominated the world for years, but 1932 marks the beginning of the decline of his kingdom, without a doubt.</p>
<h3>㈢ Borotra (France)</h3>
<p>His performance in the Davis</p>
<p>Cup against the United States</p>
<p>must give Borotra third place. France's ability to retain the Davis Cup is due to Borotra's efforts alone. He defeated Vines in the first singles match and Allison on the last day. Although the United States claimed that his victory over Allison was a questionable and unfair decision, this kind of dispute only arose among Americans and does not seem to be in the spirit of sportsmanship.</p>
<h3>㈣ Allison (USA)</h3>
<p>Allison is ranked fourth. He reached the semi-finals</p>
<p>in the U.S. National Tennis Championships, losing to Cochet in five sets. He also battled Borotra to five sets in the Davis Cup.</p>
<h3>㈤ Shields (USA)</h3>
<p>Shields greatly distinguished</p>
<p>himself in the U.S. National</p>
<p>Championships, defeating Austin with scores of 6-2,</p>
<p>6-0, and 7-5, and was the only one capable of resisting Vines. In the semi-finals, he initially won two sets against Vines, and was only one point away from achieving an astonishing straight-set victory in the third set.</p>
<h3>㈥ Prenn (Germany)</h3>
<p>Prenn's special performance in the Davis Cup</p>
<p>resulted in him being ranked sixth.</p>
<p>He defeated Perry, Austin, and Hughes.</p>
