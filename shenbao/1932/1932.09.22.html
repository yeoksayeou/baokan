<p>時評</p>
<h3>國際前途與我國民所以自處</h3>
<p>元</p>
<p>東亞之中日滿洲問題。與歐陸之德法軍備問題。顯然兩問題也。然自國聯方面視之。則實有牽連爲一之勢。因歐陸德法軍備之爭不速解决。勢必無暇顧及東亞。東亞中日滿洲之爭不速解决。亦將增加歐陸問題之困難。故今日國聯處境。確甚困難。對此兩問題。須統籌全局以謀所以壓平戰爭之方策。亦爲勢所必然。但爲國聯計。衡量兩方事實。東亞問題。關係列强之利害雖鉅。而歐洲問題之關係。尤爲切膚。中日間之調解雖甚不易。而德法問題之調解。尤爲棘手。蓋德法兩强。且皆意態堅决。其間自難左右輕。中日則惟以日本有龐大之武力。足以撳動世界戰爭是懼。中國則素尙和平。不妨稍加壓抑於此而求所以消弭戰禍之爆發。則自以先解决東亞問題爲得計。欲東亞問題之速了。自不得不曲意遷就日本。以滿其所大欲。而所謂公理正道有所不計矣。不能澈底和平。祗得徇强權以謀苟且之和平矣。此雖爲吾人懸揣之談。然觀近日國際間之空氣。如最近路透所傳。國聯將力圖避免與日本衝突。依允其展緩討論李頓報告書之請求。又謂某國亦將繼日本而承認僞組織。此種傳說。實皆有蛛絲馬跡可尋者也。</p>
<p>此後國際間而果有此趨勢。我國將何以自處乎。德自提出軍備平等要求後。列强皆爲震動。法報初疑英必同情於德而示敵意。今見英覆文並不袒德。乃一變其態度而爲贊美。則英法之間。巳有默契。可不言而喻。德人初料英國覆文。措詞必甚和緩。今則已大爲失望。然德人雖失望。並不因此而退縮。且愈以激起其堅决之態度。仍堅持其不出席之主張。此即德國强毅不屈之精神所表現也。德旣具此强毅不屈之精神。國聯自必重視之而謀所以轉圜之方。今我國民。亦有此强毅不屈之精神乎。壓迫之來。能如德人之一致團結以全力爭之乎。使我國民而果有此精神者。料列强亦不敢輕易加以壓迫。此又顯然可見者也。</p>
<p>惟然而國人當知所以自處。今日不必恨他人。恨自己無德國之能力耳。不必怨列强。怨自己無德國奮發圖强之决心耳。亦不必忿世界無是非無公道。忿自己無德國抵抗强權之武備耳。今日且勿論德國。當爲吾人所效法。即我對手方之日本最近表示。亦有足資吾人警惕者。報載東京府市敎化團體發起之非常時打開國民自力更生運動大演講。昨日開會。首相齋藤演詞。謂「思維我國前途。外則承認滿洲後有幾何困難。内則農漁山村之疲敝。中小工商業之困憊。歲入之不振。失業之續出。思想界之混亂。皆非容易度過。……爾來數經歲月。浮華放縱之習。依然存在。輕佻驕激之風。尙未止息。而在非常時須有非常之覺悟。願吾國民奮其刻苦之精神。眞能舉舉國一致之實。以排除難局。今幸各地乃有自力更生之說。望毋專賴政府之補助救援。步步建立更生之企圖。」嗚呼。日本之國民爲勝利自驕之國民。乃其所以致力者如此。日之首相爲年邁力衰之首相。乃其所以策勉國民者如此。然則我國民。處此十百倍於日本之非常時。能有十百倍於日本國民之非常覺悟耶。我國今日。祗有望我國民有此非常之覺悟耳。有此覺悟。始能有德國奮發圖强之精神。至國聯將來如何處理中日問題。列强如何壓迫我民族。可不問也。</p>

<p>敎育消息特載</p>
<h3>改革中國學校敎育芻議（二）</h3>
<p>程天放</p>
<p>第二、生産落後、經濟枯竭是中國最大的危機、現在中國人衣食住行的需要、都要仰給於舶來品、不用講大一點的交通用具、如輪船、火車、飛機等、要向外國買、就是小一點的工業品、如鐘錶、自來水筆甚至釘書的釘夾紙的夾、鎖門的鎖、縫紐的針也都來自外洋這還不算稀奇、最奇怪的、中國是發明蠶絲和絲織品最早的國家、而現在舶來綢緞充斥市塲、中國是幾千年的農業國、而現在建築房屋須用洋松、宴客酒肴必維洋菜、甚至人民的糧食也須　外國、民國二十年米麥兩項入口額、超過出口額達二萬萬元以上、這是何等可恥的情形、何等危險的現象、照此下去、人家不必調一兵、不必發一砲我們也非日趨滅亡不可、尤其危險的是過去的敎育不但不能增加人民生産能力、反而减少人民生産能力本來是個農家子弟、假如他不受敎育、長大後還可以做一個胼手胝足的農夫、一受敎育便再也不肯下田耕種、本來是個工人子弟、假如他不受敎育、長大後還可以做一個刻苦耐勞的工人、一受敎育便再也不肯動手作工這種現象、到處皆是所以大學畢業、中學畢業、甚至小學畢業的學生、大多數都成爲安坐而食的不生産份子、大家都往政界敎育界擠、擠不進去的就失業、所以學校畢業生一年多一年、失業的人也就一年多一年、社會上不安定的狀態也就一年甚於一年、這種敎育非促成亡國不可、我們現在必須以敎育力量挽回這種頽風、以敎育力量增加人民生産能力、原來能生産的、受敎育後生産能力更强、原來不能生産的、受敎育後也成爲生産份子、這是中國目前第二個大需要、也是敎育第二個目標、</p>
<p>第三、有良好的敎師、才能有良好的敎育、中國過去關於師資方面、有兩個大缺點一是不良二是不夠、怎麽講不良呢、現在中小學的敎師當中、以敎育爲終身事業、勤勤懇懇、謀兒童幸福的人固然有、但是說句不客氣的話、大多數實在是不明瞭國家的需要、不了解敎育的目標、在那裏試行故事敷衍度日、只要能按時上課、不曠廢學生光陰、巳算是盡職的了、因爲敎師的不良、所以造出來的學生、論智識方面則模　膚淺、食而不化、講技能方面、則一無所長、不能生産、結果都成社會上的游民、怎麽講不夠呢、現在固然是都市裏可以常常遇見失業的師範畢業生、和大學敎育系畢業生、但是鄉村裏面的小學、想找一個師範畢業的敎師却難如登天、如果我們眞要普及國民敎育、那現在僅有的師範畢業生、更是不敷分配、所以我們要藉敎育的力量造成許多良好的師資、這種敎師不僅要有豐富的智識、能夠敎書并且要有生産的能力、熱烈的情緖、高尙的人格、在整個生活上可以爲兒童的模範、有這樣的敎師、才可以造成健全的國民、才可以擔負救國的責任、這是中國目前第三個大需要、也是敎育第三個目標、</p>
<p>第四、中國現在處處人浮於事、曝露着失業的大問題、而另一方面却非常感覺人才缺乏的痛苦、無論學術方面、事業方面、都是如此、中國派遣留學生幾十年了、回國的留學生也上千上萬了、但是有多少能夠在學術界有貢獻有樹立的、有多少自己有專門的著作的、有多少曾經將外國學者的名著有系統的介紹到中國來的、眞是寥寥可數、這是表示學術人才的缺乏、中國現在修鐡路要請外國專家做顧問、練軍隊要請外國專家做顧問、興水利要請外國專家做顧問、改良農業刷新市政也要請外國專家做顧問、處處表示事業人才的缺乏、中國現在要想發展農工商礦森林水利交通市政一切事業、非趕緊培植事業人才不可、要想闡揚學術文化提高民族地位、非趕緊培植學術人才不可、而培植人才、還是要靠敎育力量、這是中國目前第四個大需要、也是敎育第四個目標、</p>
<p>第五、有了大多數健全國民、也有了少數專門人才、國家遺缺乏什麽不缺乏呢、還缺乏政治的領袖、中國現在一切農工商礦森林水道交通市政等事業、都和政治息息相關、如果政治不淸明、政治不上軌道、一切事業不能受政治力量的保護、反要受政治力量的摧殘、那就儘管有車載斗量的專門人才、也只有望洋興嘆、任何事業都不能發達、而且現在赤匪猖獗、人民不能安居樂業、社會上表露極度不安寗的狀態、如何去根本消滅赤匪、安定社會、也决不是專靠武力所能奏效、而有賴於修明的政治、但是如何才能有修明的政治、那先决問題就是先要有良好的政治領袖、政治領袖本來也可以稱爲政治專門人才、爲什麽我要另列一類呢、這是因爲政治人才與其他專門人才性質大不同、相其他專門人才、國家對他所要求的、就是他的專門技能或學識、他所貢獻於國家的、也就是他的專門技能或學識、一個鐡路工程師、國家只希望他能造成良好的鐡路、一個建築工程師、國家只希望他能建築堅固其他的房屋、一個化學家國家只希望他對於化學極深研究做有價值的貢獻、至於在本行之外、他的别項智　是否豐富、他的思想是否卓　、他的行爲是否完全無可疵　、這是我們不應該　求的、但是政治領袖不然了、家對於政治領袖所要求的、不是他的專門智識或技能、而在他能領導社會、轉移風尙、任賢使能、推進各種事業、舉例來講、一省的主席、一縣的縣長、鄭　該是政治領袖、主席或縣長可以不懂工程、但是他應該引用良好的工程專家、將一省或一縣的工程專業做好、主席或縣長可以不懂敎育、但是他應該引用敎育專家、將一省或一縣的敎育辦得發達、中國社會到處都是衰頽鬆懈凌亂貪汚的現象、　政治領袖的人、就應該以身作則、轉移風氣、易衰頽以振作、易鬆懈以緊張、易凌亂以條調、易貪汚以廉潔、中國是「上有好者下必有甚焉者也」的社會、所以改革社會不良風氣的工作、只有負政治責任的人來做、才能收速效、而不是其他專門人才所能做到的、還有一層可以證明政治領袖與專門人才的不同、專門人才是差不多可以不分國家的、在美國是個大工程師、到日本也是個大工程師、到蘇俄還是個大工程師、在英國是個大化學家、到德國也是一個大化學家、到中國也還是大化學家、政治領袖却是一定要出於本國的、所以美國的政治家没法去改良日本的政治、蘇俄的政治家也没法去領導英國的人民、因此故、專門人才缺乏時可以取材異地、而政治領袖則不能、中國要導淮可以請美國人、做工程師、要練陸軍可以請德國人做顧問、但是某一省缺乏一個良好主席、某一縣缺乏一個良好縣長、就决不能請外國人來擔任了、中國缺乏專門人才、但尤其缺乏政治領袖、這種政治領袖也祗有用敎育力量去造成、這是中國目前第五個大需要也、是敎育第五個目標、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<h3>大阪「每日新聞」記者來訪問答</h3>
<p>日本大阪每日新聞上海支局長澤村幸夫偕翻譯員龍岡登攝影師某，來訪相老人；事前備函稱爲編印世界名人錄故，請求會晤。後來將訪問記刊入上海人物印象記第二集中。略述會晤談話。</p>
<p>日本記者問：老先生對於日本，有什麽覲念和感想？相老人答：數十年前，中國留日學生，許多是我勸他們去的。他們想到歐美去；我說中國人研究日本的國情更要緊。據我親身觀察所得，日本國民性的特長，在勤儉而服從。記得明治維新，有幕府，投水自盡，爲忠君愛國故：這是東京山下的不忍池，你們想來也去憑弔過的！日本記者又問：老先生的中心思想如何？</p>
<p>相老人答：我没有特創的學說。ＣATHOLIC的敎義，我奉爲中心思想的。加特力敎，大公無私；所以我認識國際情况，也持這種公正的態度。眼前我對你們，就不因爲外國人的緣故而车視你們；並不像白種人輕視我黃種人一般。</p>
<p>日本記者拿英文精印的「現代日本」和外加盛飾的舞扇，做贄見禮；立談之間，鞠躬如也，不失所謂紳士的容儀：因此相老人優待他們，臨别前，允攝影，和贈題「光爲日本敎乃國基」字。後來他們告辭了。相老人說：扇是東洋老樣子，盛飾是敬禮的表示，看現代日本書中有半裸舞女，不禁歎惜染了西洋惡俗了！</p>
<h3>九一八愛神致詞</h3>
<p>— 阿紅</p>
<p>靑年男女聽者！</p>
<p>我寵愛的孩子們：我以無邊的情，彌深的愛，至高的和平，來將護你們！在我的領域裏，只有甜美丨只有喜悅！只有親熱！詩令雖分四季，然而我這裏只有春天丨在這種氛圍裏，没有嗔怒丨也没有怨尤丨你們是各遂其生而我，也獲得了無上的愉快丨</p>
<p>可是，在去年，九一八那天，不知從甚麽角落裏，冒出一批人類的愛的叛逆來：它們盤踞在興安嶺下，率獸食人，極盡醜惡！蹂躪所及，千萬方里！擾攘經年，兇殘愈甚！這蛇的族類，那裏還有人性？奪其魂魄，固是死神的權力：可是，驅逐這些醜惡東西，出我們領域之外，我却還能領導你們！</p>
<p>來！來！寵愛的孩子們！我們且莫談情說愛！也不要吟風弄月！快武裝起來、去！向興安嶺街上前去！爲：維護和平而戰·：</p>
<p>維護愛的領域而戰！這才眞是偉大啊！可是，記着：我的孩子！可别摸錯了我的箭哇！</p>
<h3>王寵惠軼事</h3>
<p>— 在君</p>
<p>厭聞國事，息影海牙之前任司法院長王寵惠氏，其生平逸事，鮮有知者，茲記之以告讀者。</p>
<p>王氏廣東人，爲我國留法學生中得博士頭銜之第一人，有老博士之譽，旅居歐美數十年，絶無西洋習氣，且恨染西洋習氣者，人有革履西服見之者，王必表示不滿。蓋王先生在國中，固亦未見其服夷服也。</p>
<p>先生好學不倦，每晚非至二時後輙不眠，不善修飾，衣履雖破汚，如不促其更，輙不知自換也。先生常嫌宴會之不經濟時間，故人有請先生者，先生至後即大嚼，手不停箸，及飽即去，絶不流連。</p>
<p>某次先生乘車赴滬，偶不愼，桌上杯壼，悉墮地粉碎，侍役向之索賠，先生窘而不答。役侵之益甚，乃連呼無錢，惴惴不知所措，蓋先生外出，袋中素不名一文也。及隨從者至，其圍始解。</p>
<h3>參觀龐薰琴畫展之後</h3>
<p>— 紅墨</p>
<p>龐薰琴的個人繪畫展覽會於十五日開幕，記者於十六之晨，欣然往觀。因爲時尙早，參觀者還不甚擁擠，遂得從容觀讀。</p>
<p>此次畫展給予我的印象，確乎較之在最近過去的畫展中所得的印象要美好得多。粗製濫造，虚僞，膚淺，抄襲，在龐君的畫面上這些劣點自然是絶跡無踪的了。</p>
<p>記得第一次見到龐君的畫是在去年的南京市府美展中，出品於該展的畫，卽此次第四十三號的「西班牙舞」。在這畫面上除了西班牙的Ｍantilla潑辣强有力的女性，妖冶的舞姿，富於誘惑性的媚眼之外，活潑的筆觸，强烈的色彩，同樣充分地表現了Ｇypce女性特有的氣質。當時頗以不得多讀龐君的畫爲憾。欣慰的很；此次得以滿足了我一年來的要求。</p>
<p>當然的，一張畫的成功，結搆是非常重要的條件。這一層，龐君却頗有把握。他採用圖案式的搆圖去佈置他的畫面，而且常常他所站在對象某一方向的地位是一般畫家所不注意的所在。因此他的章法就格外的顯得新奇有趣，這一點在他的幾幅裸體上特别容易見到。</p>
<p>近來年畫壇上似乎越加不注意技術了。丨當然，這是指基礎而言。丨大槪是受了歐洲新畫理的影響。不過一切新興的學識搬到中國就容易失掉它的眞面目，在給畫的表現上也不曾例外，許多執畫筆的人，丨不好意思稱他們畫家丨以顔料塗滿了丨或哉不全塗丨畫布，自欺欺人地公然懸之於展覽會中，或有指而問之，則說「這是物體的變形，自我的表現，天才的創造。」門外漢自然只得唯唯而已。記得有一次在某展覽便中，一位畫家向我說「現在的繪畫豈特變形，簡直是解體。」這位畫家固爲我平日所欽佩，這句批評尤其使的折服。現在正是畫壇解體的時候，龐君以眞實變形的畫面出來柱持這個危局。他無論描繪一件什麽物體，第一步是變形，第二步是重新造形，經過這二層的鍛鍊，方完成了他嚴正又眞實的畫面，這是他最大的長處。所以我說他柱持了當今這解體的危局，或許不算過譽吧？</p>
<p>前幾年曾有人說「中國只有抒情的小品畫，却没有思想的偉搆。」這話如乎還不曾舊，因爲」</p>
<p>數年來畫壇確乎没有發揮思想的偉大創作出現，連說這句話的本人也没有發表過，眞是件怪事！這次龐君的畫展也不能免此通病，在對於龐君關懷頗切的我，不無多少遺憾，不過這似乎是責之過甚的話了。</p>
<p>鵑按：我也曾參觀過龐君的畫展，很佩服他能以中國畫的線條用之於油畫，其自畫像與一古裝美人圖，更富於仇十洲的作風，其餘的話，紅墨先生己先我言之，因此我也不多說了。</p>
<h3>節禮與捐欵</h3>
<p>— 朱戳</p>
<p>丨一個比例丨</p>
<p>「中秋月餅」「中秋節禮，ＸＸ最宜」誘惑色彩的大字廣告，明顯地刊滿在報紙上。挾着纍纍紙包的人們，潮水似的，在黄昏燦爛的燈光裏，在三公司和馬路的人行道上，擠着擁着。丨在這團體的中秋節邊，處處都少不了購買節禮和餽送節禮的人們，來點綴一下。九一八的紀念，原不過和五九，五卅一般，成了日歷上的名辭；東北的河山，早像「九牛亡一毛」，久已無足輕重。但關外義勇軍苦戰的新聞，還可以像瞧着「滬氓聚衆，搶刦少女」，與「文學家哲學家打戀愛官司」，一般的提起興味，看到「大舉攻瀋陽」等等新聞，也會像看全武行好戲似的，發出幾聲贊賞的彩聲。丨然而對於這軍械不足，糧食缺乏的義勇軍，肯解囊捐欵的又有幾人！　　是的。義勇軍内有張學良的接濟？外有蘇俄的扶助？中國不是我一個人救得來的，還是吃吃月餅瞧　報上全武行的新聞。丨於是購買節禮的，人如潮擁，捐欵東北的，寥若晨星！這是中華民國二十一年九月中的現象。</p>
<h3>說部扶輪會銀絲（二十一）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>（十一）</p>
<p>會場上是擠得水洩不通，而且有些混亂狀態，都是猜疑袁團長遲遲不到會的原因。「做了團長便這麽擺架子，當了師長軍長還了得！」</p>
<p>「也許發生了重大的事件，這幾天外面謠言就很多呢。」</p>
<p>「諸伯方辦事太糊塗，應該早就親自派汽車去迎接才對；不去迎接，團長自然要生氣不來」</p>
<p>了。」</p>
<p>「也許師長軍長吃醋，羨慕他的紀念碑，團長不敢到會了。」</p>
<p>「不是的，剛才縣長，公安局長，商會主席，諸家姑娘等，不是像載鬼一車去迎接過而又失望地回來了麽？不是他們剛才宣布說團長己一人獨自出門，大槪不久就可以到會麽？我想遲到現在還不到，不要是凶多吉少，路上被漢奸謀害了。」</p>
<p>許多人無意識地猜測與討論的時候，而台上大家也在商議，决定立刻舉行開會，不再延滯，因爲時間已不早，先由各方面演說，揭幕的一節，移到最後的節目。</p>
<p>小學校裏的上課鈴，小得像上海賣蛋糕麫包人手裡搖得　樣，而比内地推火油車子的鈴還要小，諸伯方肥得像一隻水牛，執着這小鈴，用力地搖，宣布開會，而會場上還是靜不下來，鈴聲和秋天的金鈴子的虫聲一般。</p>
<p>台下忽然起了一陣鼓噪，台上是莫名其妙。</p>
<p>「靜些！大家靜些！」開會了！開會了！」諸伯方狂喊着，但是無效，羣衆不在注意台上，而都掉過身子向後看。</p>
<p>諸綺蘭眼光敏銳，伊先瞧見遠遠地袁團長在慢慢地走來，便喊道：「啊！他來了，他來了！」伊歡喜得如獲至寳，手舞足蹈地表示出伊心花在怒放。</p>
<p>於是縣長公安局長等等聽着諸綺蘭的喊聲而也注意到了。於是諸伯方一面指揮軍樂隊奏樂，一面跟了縣長走下台去，上前迎接。</p>
<p>「眞平民化的團長，旣不騎馬，又不乘車，更没有一個馬弁副官，從城裡走來，眞是一個」</p>
<p>好團長！」羣衆格外信仰而崇拜，但是没有一個人知道他在本鎭上幽會情人而來。</p>
<p>諸綺蘭醉心於歐化，服膺着ＬadyFirst的習慣，首先上去給團長握手，而且緊緊地握着，足有兩分鐘；但是縣長心裏是很不快活，因爲他是一縣縣長，應該由他先上去握手，却被諸綺蘭搶足上去先握了。</p>
<p>公安局長當然是向縣長拍馬屁的，便在後面過意向諸綺蘭一擠，伊站不住，便只得鬆手站開，於是縣長，公安局長等等，依次上前立正，鞠躬握手。</p>

<p>豫陜晋魯之棉産估計</p>
<p>豫陜晋三省之棉産、據日棉界八月底調查、鄭州棉作狀况、本年雨量缺乏、播種較遲兩禮拜、出芽時天氣尙好、六月後甚旱、至七月中旬止、前後四十餘日無雨、發育大受阻碍、棉樹將枯、幸七月中旬後天降甘霖、始得恢復、各地隨雨量多少、而回復程度各異、</p>
<p>河南　靈寳陜州地方雨量較多、約七分收成、開花結實均好、氣温高熱、如再有適宜雨水、當可期望豐收、洛陽雨量稍少、約六分成收、偃師河陰地方可得七分、惟鄭州近郊降雹、大受損害、不過二分半收成、但平均可得六分四、孟縣鞏縣七分、黄河北岸小冀地方最受雨量之惠、可得八分、平均有七分四厘收成、棉田面積、靈寳陜州地方增百分之四、洛陽偃師鄭州小冀等處去年激增、而今年無甚增减、</p>
<p>陜西　渭水以北、産地旱荒特著、七月中雖得微雨、樹幹仍矮小、不過二分收成、渭水南之咸陽·西安·渭南·新築·赤水·華州·各地雨量稍多、可得五分收成、又朝邑同州等沿黄河一帶、八月間大雨、堤防潰决、淹没甚多、僅一分收成耳、棉田以取締種鴉片、故植棉可增百分之十、</p>
<p>山西　洪洞絳州臨汾等産地、大部份洪水汜濫而受損、約三分五厘收成、黄河韓陽等中部地方平原地多受水害、約二分收成、長縣安巴解縣地方、六七月間旱荒殊甚、雖八月降雨、不易回復、預測四分收成、</p>
<p>陜西山西兩省之良棉産地、平均估計之不過三分之七收成、河南陜西山西三省全産地收成、平均五分之三、據該處人言、可稱平年收成、棉田面積、去年食糧不足、曾經减少、本年亦因糧食棉賤、再見减少、三省棉田平均比去年增百分之二、山西之减少、由他省增加相抵償、結果殊無增减、棉産估計如下、（單位千担）</p>

<p>山東省　據靑島日商棉花同業會調查、本年度山東産棉量、八月二十日發表估計、植棉面積、較去年約增一成、七月中旬大雨傾盆、其後内地多雨水、棉鈴散落、近已天氣轉晴、稍得轉佳、故大體收成與去年相仿云、</p>
<p>美英棉一致前進</p>
<p>昨日美棉初因天氣不佳而堅、旋因多頭了結而疲、卒因空戶抵補再昂、計期貨漲四至七磅音、現貨漲五磅音、英棉期貨漲五點、現貨漲三點、埃及棉現貨漲五點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（二十日電）</p>

<p>糧食　米市形勢站定</p>
<p>滬南　昨日米市各帮米船二三十號、因銀根緊迫交易淸淡、常錫北粳與蘇同帮到銷二平、開盤站定、新粳新杜洋尖各短一角、平望周莊等貨市無榮辱、糯米薄稻糕粳舖去路活、價升轉角許、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日米情裏路來源約二十餘號、形勢一蹶不振、早晨開盤北粳新鮮定局、中關喊起角許、早晚稻貨稀銷淡價無上落、其餘客貨呈下游之象、</p>
<p>小絞銷淡疲軟</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、客帮仍無問津、本街胃口尙活、惟成交數目不多、滬市存積較多之小絞米、交易更少、昨日祗由本街辦去五百包、客帮未辦、内地·江北·長江各路咸有新秈上市、均無過問、致行情小去四五分、西貢米近日貨主略有售意、但以存積不多、市形依然堅固、昨日本街辦去一千三百包、市面略見帶緊、價開九元六角至四角、又中關宿米開九元一角半、小絞米爲八元六角半至五角二分、</p>
<p>粉市逐步轉機</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份市價逐步轉機、良以洋麥後定旣不合劃、而國外期貨來電又復報漲一二角、廠方旣無定進新麥、亦不在市抛賣、且邇日客銷雖無大帮去路、零星抽買、尙形熱閙、而各廠多數未有開足全數粉機、出粉不多、市形乃得立定、昨日洋麥報漲後引起囤買與業外多頭問津、各月份市價乃得逐盤緊砌、收盤堅俏、計九月大一分二五、十月大一分、十一月大一分半、十二月大一分二五、一月大一分、二月大七五、</p>
<p>小麥漲而復跌</p>
<p>昨日麥市上午開市後、各月份市價一致趨大、因洋麥報大、人心回好之故、洋麥旣難定購、市價似有步漲之必要但多頭以市價上升後、隨將餘額售出新定亦有加入、故下午開市後、各月份又復一致趨下、收市價九月至二月六個月均各小一分現麥祗開瑤灣麥五百包、價三兩五錢一二分、由阜豐等辦去、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥回漲</p>

<p>海南元肉、近日到貨轉稀、而地價回升、此間自漲價以來、市勢仍佳、昨南北市各號均有開出、價爲二十七兩二三錢、惟餘貨客號要扳二十八兩、故尙擯持未開、後市以走勢而論、恐難過高、</p>
<p>糖市　靑糖復見微降</p>
<p>昨日糖市以荷匯見縮、標金堅穩、公會劃盤趨勢復轉穩定、二十四號粗砂白劃十四兩六錢、成交不少、二十號中砂白呌十四兩一錢、未成盤、廠家方面、有振新開出頭號冰花靑一批、計百餘袋、價爲十一兩九錢半、比前小二錢許、又建帮號家開出三號冰數十包、價爲十五兩半、又三號冰花靑一批、價爲十兩○半、原盤、又廣帮號家開出碍靑一批、九兩二錢、比前略降、但以走銷較呆、後市仍看續鬆、</p>

<h3>海道測量局長</h3>
<p>吳光宗昨被刺</p>
<p>晨起被擊四槍</p>
<p>午前傷重殞命</p>
<p>凶手四人脫逃</p>
<p>海軍部海道測量局局長吳光宗氏、昨日上午九時十五分、在南市西門方斜路寗康里二弄十六號寓邸、被剌客四人、衝入内室、向吳氏開槍狙擊、週身共中四彈、剌客當塲兎脫、吳氏送仁濟醫院救治、惟因吳年事巳高、流血過多、且四彈悉中要害、延至上午十一時二十五分、在院殞命、同時海軍部測量局市政府均聞耗派員前往吳宅慰問、市公安局長文鴻恩、特親自履勘、茲將經過情形、詳述於後、</p>
<p>暴徒侵入　吳氏年逾耳順、而精神矍鑠、供職甚勤、向除星期例假外、每日上午九時、必親至楓林橋辦公、風雨無間、昨晨起身特早、七時即離床、正在大便之際、吳宅後突侵入暴徒四人、三人御灰色長衫一着黑色長袍、三人戴呢帽、一戴草帽、入門時吳之隨從徐華（海軍警衛第一連土兵充吳之保鑣）即上前迎出、詢尋何人、而其一忽操浙江嵊縣口音、向徐云、「你們吳老爺在家嗎」、徐見來人衣履不類、形跡可疑、亟答以「老爺巳到局辦公去了」、</p>
<p>入樓狙擊　暴徒又續向徐曰、「我們今天特來向吳老爺借幾個盤費」、言至此、徐正欲作答、四人巳同出手槍、留一人監視徐華、餘三人即執槍、一擁上樓、先將吳妾張氏、及女傭小孩等人、驅逐下樓、與徐華禁閉於客堂後東廂房内、三人復行登樓尋找吳氏、不料吳氏之臥室在客堂樓、房門尙未開啓、三人竟繞道由東面廂房而達吳氏臥室、時吳正便畢拽袴由床後而出、三暴徒一見吳氏、如鷹攫燕雀、順手將客房門撬開、將吳拖至扶梯口、即以盒子砲對準吳氏週身、狙擊四槍、</p>
<p>車送醫院　三暴徒見目的已達、當即踉蹌下樓、喚同監視一人、仍由後門而出、越弄奔逃、時谬處崗警已聞聲趕至、適與暴徒相值、遂互相轟擊十餘槍、惟均未命中同時吳宅被監視樓下諸人、最初聞得樓上槍聲四響、知事不妙、然在暴徒威脅之下、均不敢聲張、嗣見暴徒完全逃出後門、始爭先上樓察看、惟吳氏巳奄奄一息、倒臥樓口、亟由吳妾張氏、急以電話報告海軍第一艦隊司令部、一面用自備汽車、將吳氏車送麥家圈仁濟醫院救治、</p>
<p>傷重殞命　吳氏抵院時、巳不省人事、由陳澄醫師及護士長等、先檢騐週身傷部、計中四彈、一彈由左口角斜入至後頸枕骨而出、左邊上下牙全落、一自右胸乳房射入、洞穿後背、一自左脇入、未穿、一彈擊穿右腿脛骨、全部幾處要害、當時吳氏之呼吸益促、雙目微開、厥狀至慘、據陳醫師云、似此情形、性命蓋巳絶望、延至上午十一時二十五分、殁於該院第二八六號病房、張氏如夫人在旁、慟哭失聲、令人酸鼻、</p>
<p>文氏查勘　該管公安局第二區區長金田得報後、當即率同探員韓瑞生等、馳赴寗康里吳宅、時暴徒巳無蹤跡、金區長當在吳氏身旁、檢獲暴徒遺落之假牙三顆、及子彈兩粒、當即帶回存案、並留警士一名、在吳宅看守、以免有閒雜人等出進、並即報告文局長及市政府、文局長得報後、即親自乘坐汽車赴吳氏寓所查勘、並逐一詢問附近崗警後、始行返局、同時、更飭令該管二區轉霧金區長　密偵查、務於最短期間、弋獲暴徒、以張法紀、</p>
<p>一度遇剌　吳氏之被剌、此爲第二次、當民十六年間、楊樹莊任海軍總司令時、吳氏任該部參謀長、時在原處、亦曾被人狙擊、一彈中其口、打落牙齒三枚、吳氏痛極倒地、暴徒誤爲巳中要害、當即揚長逸去、吳即由仁濟醫院醫治得痊、事隔數年、不謂又慘遭擊斃也、又據海軍界方面之人談、則謂或係公事關係、因吳平日爲人甚爲剛直、最易開罪於人、在彼固不知、而在他人則巳與吳締深仇、三年前曾有人刺吳、彈中其下腭而未死、不圖此次復遭辣手、此或即係三年前之仇客、亦未可知云、</p>
<p>運屍糾紛　下午二時、白吳氏之親戚現任兵工廠職員之馬德建君、用電話通知萬國殯儀館、派車至醫院、運送吳屍至該館、以備今日入殮、當車至醫院時、因未得法院檢騐、故捕房禁止移動、後由馬君會同吳氏次子寳鉞、赴該管二區公安局託金田區長、請免騐入殮、以便運屍至萬國殯儀館、金區長未敢擅專、偕同乘坐汽車至公安局、請示文局長、時文氏正在開會、由第一科用電話通知四馬路老巡捕房、請予准吳屍先行運往殯儀館、今日再請地方法院派員檢騐、並由金區長范巡官偕同吳公子及馬君同車往捕房、由捕房派員會同至仁濟醫院、將吳屍用殯儀館汽車運至該館、時巳下午四時、聞定今日下午五時大殮、</p>
<p>海部慰問　吳氏被刺事件發生後、海道測量局方面、立即將詳情報告南京海軍部、海部派駐滬辦事處張楫蔚往吳宅慰問、據張氏談、吳之被剌原因、尙未得悉、海部將按例給予撫卹金、至於局長之繼任人選、尙未確定、海部尙在酌裁中、吳局長被剌後、海部方面、亦通知公安局、請爲嚴緝兇犯、</p>
<p>吳氏履歷　吳光宗、字毓卿、福建閩侯人、年六十三歲、係馬尾海軍學校畢業、少將銜、曾任海軍部福安艦艦長·軍衛科科長·海軍部參事·海軍司令部參謀長·等職、現任海道測量局局長、對於海軍方面資望極深、有一妻二妾、現寓滬者其第二妾張氏、年四十歲、餘則留閩、滬寓有一保鑣、名徐華、二丫環·一名秋紅·一名冬梅、膝下有三子二女、長子十八歲、肄業於福州海軍學校、次子十六歲、肄業於本市聖約翰大學、三子十五歲、肄業於本市正始中學、二女則均肄業於滬西聖瑪利亞女校、</p>
<h3>東北航權斷送</h3>
<p>僞國通令徵稅</p>
<p>華輪行駛困難</p>
<p>九月十五日、日本承認僞國後、東北之大連·安東·營口·三處海關、即實行徵稅、而華輪行駛發生阻碍、東北航權、完全斷送、且影響國内之民生、亟將詳情查記如下、</p>
<p>徵稅　　僞國巳於日本承認後、公布大連·安東·營口·三處海關、在九月二十五日以後、凡商輪進口、統須徵收噸鈔、如不付納、即拒發船牌、禁止輪行、而商貨之進出安東·營口·大連·者、亦於是日起、須按照所訂之僞稅率徵收關稅、向來中國貨往來該三埠、無須納稅、今亦一律徵收、如果拒納、即扣貨科罰、</p>
<p>改航　華商輪行駛東北各埠者、滬上有海昌·政記·肇興·毓大·等輪公司、自去年九一八以後、各該輪局乃聘用日人船員應掛僞國旂號、得以苟延殘喘、今則日本承認僞組織而互訂條約、苟延殘喘之華商輪、亦發生問題、蓋未與立約、即不能通商、故華輪在禁航中也、現在各該輪公司、尙無一定辦法、在本月二十五日以後、如果僞國禁止華輪航行、各公司擬將現行之船、調至北洋各海口暫行、以維營業、</p>
<p>雜糧　東北出産最多爲大荳·荳油·雜糧·苞米、而運至本國内地者、以上海廣州·汕頭·厦門·之去路最大、每年以三四五月至十月、分運載最多約十餘萬噸、今一旦阻斷、殊足影響民食、滬上雜糧帮與廣帮糧食商、已經討論此事、擬此後之需要雜糧、改由國内之海州·長江·及隴海·等三處之貨、以爲抵補、惟統計雜糧方面尙可所得一部、油類則不敷甚巨、猶無補救之策、</p>
<p>日船　大連方面、日船日增、上年更添大批新輪、今已與僞國訂定密約、將東北各埠沿海航權、完全讓與日輪經營、大連汽社在營安兩路、巳派新船崑山丸·山東丸·河北丸·等十二輪行駛專班、而大阪商社近海汽社以及其他之各輪社六家、亦各調大批海輪到東北、藉以得得專航之利、且聞九月廿五日起、日輪之航行東北者、不論運費客脚、槪以六成實收、藉以賈惠於東北人民、稍緩時日、便將增加水脚、</p>
<p>影響　滬上外籍輪船、現雖照常行走東北、但生意已一落萬丈、本月二十五日以後、恐亦發生無約阻航的問題矣、又本埠各華輪公司、此後亦將受聯帶損失、蓋東北之國輪停航後、勢必移至南北洋開駛、照現在情形、尙感貨少輪多、一旦加班、尤使粥少僧　多、同受損失也、</p>

<h3>鐡道部整理業務計畫</h3>
<p>兪棪負責整頓</p>
<p>實施五大計劃</p>
<p>鐡部自顧孟餘長部後、鑑於全國業務之腐敗衰落、即擬着手根本整理、經即調參事兪棪爲業務司長、畀以整頓責任、數月以來、頗聞多所興革、記者昨晋京訪問該部負責當局、承詳細見告、特爲誌之如左　　實行負責運輸　吾國鐡路五十一年來運輸貨品、向不負責、遇有損失、貨商不能向鐡路索償、於是商貨有水道可循、則趨水運、其無水運之處、則託轉運公司代運、轉運公司所索運價、高於鐡路運價一倍以上、貨物成本增昂、貨商經營力與國民購買力、同時减低、而鐡路運貨額、遂一落千丈、今日國匱民貧、亦不無受此影響、去年北寗路僅擇數站、實行負責貨運、中間尙遭九一八之變、關外路線、盡遭僭據、然九個月中祗負責貨運一部份、已增加進欵三百三十餘萬、則貨運負責與不負責、其利害判然可覩、聞該部自本年五月、卽首定各路實行負責貨運程序、一面釐訂各種負責運輸章則、中間雖經轉運業聯合反對、但社會人士、經該部分别在京滬各處開會、招待商會及各業公會·銀行公會·曁新聞界代表、已漸知負責運輸之不容再緩、咸表同情、現在津浦·京滬·滬杭甬·各路、已經實行、貨商託運、極爲踴躍、行見鐡路積弊、從此肅除、貨運暢達、沿線各省、農工商業、咸被其利、卽鐡路本身、如能全國推行、積弊一掃、則每年收入、至少可增至四五萬萬元之譜、（現在每年收入僅一萬八千萬元）</p>
<p>力爭鹽斤給耗　鹽斤自産地轉運銷場風雨侵蝕、分量不免耗損、故鹽場向例、於已納稅報運之鹽外、准其帶運若干不納稅之鹽、以資抵補、謂之給耗、雖屬體恤鹽商、然每年損失國課不少、海州之鹽運銷蘇皖、水運裝輪、運至長江一帶、分銷各地、陸運則利用隴海·津浦·兩線、但水運每百斤給耗九斤、而陸運僅給五斤、不啻水運可多免國稅百分之四、故鹽商悉趨水運、海州外輪運鹽營業、至爲發達、隴海津浦線鹽運、遂一落千丈、是給耗辦法、固不免有損國課、卽國有鐡路之營業、亦爲外輪所奪、公家受兩重損失、實有改革之必要、據該部調查所得、如將給耗辦法、一律取消、則財部年可增收鹽稅一百五十萬以上、或將水運給耗、亦減爲五斤、俾水陸運利益均等、則鹽稅年亦可增收七十萬元左右、至於鐡路營業、但求上述兩項、實行其平均可將外輪所載之鹽吸收、年亦可增加進欵二百餘萬元、聞該部已咨財部核辦矣、</p>
<p>整理郵件運費　鐡路載運郵件、每公里每立方公尺、所定運價一釐、不及各路運輸成本、僅及六等貨運價七分之一、鐡路損失甚鉅、據詳細調查、去年一年所運郵件、計共五十三萬餘公噸、如按六等貨運價計算、鐡路損失三百餘萬元、如按包裹運價計算、損失二千六百餘萬元、而鐡路原有包裹運輸、反致衰落、爲維持鐡路成本計、已力向交通部磋商、求一根本整理辦法、</p>
<p>增加車運能力　各路屢經軍事、車輛破壞及被扣用者甚多、咸苦車輛不敷運用、現經該部業務司精確調查、統計各路因運用調度不得其法、或裝卸貨物過於費時、以致虚糜車輛者亦多、其最高能率每百輛僅得二十輛之用、低者僅及百分之五、非將運用方法改良、不足以應需要、經該司定有各路重車延噸公里標準、飭由各路車務處每日將重車延噸公里呈報、切實監督、如不及規定標準者、卽研究改善其原因之所在、務使適合標準、又飭令各路夜間裝卸貨物、以省時間、預計照此兩項辦法辦到、則車輛運輸能率、至少增進四倍以上、即全國現有一萬二千車輛、可無形中增爲四萬八千輛、鐡路總收入、亦可由一萬八千萬元增至四五萬萬元之譜、此爲絶對可能之事、惟須全國實行負責運輸爲條件耳、</p>
<p>行車耗料標準　行車材料、以煤斤及油類爲大宗、其他如紗布等物價亦不貲、每年共費千數百萬元以上、其實濫費盜竊不少、如煤斤油類等項、現經該部派員隨車監視使用數量、不使妄費、即以監視所得之數量、作爲耗費標準、嚴飭各路遵行、不得任意超越、將來倘照所定標準實行、年可茹省路欵五六百萬元之譜、綜計目前全國鐡路每年營業總收入僅一萬八千萬元、如依預定計劃實行、三年以後、當可至四萬五千元以上、至於純益一層、照第一項全國實行負責運輸、加以車輛調度運用、合乎第四項所定標準、則此兩項收入之純益、每年計可達二萬五千萬元、又第二項鹽斤給耗案、倘能辦到、年可增收二百五十萬元、每三項增加郵件運費案、年可增收五百萬元、第五項節省行車材料案、可减少支出五百萬元、即此五項、巳共可盈餘二萬六千二百五十萬元、此外各項計劃、尙未計算入内、以上數額、係根據各項統計推算、頗爲可靠、如鐡路有此鉅欵運用、則增加各路工程·設備修理舊路·建築新綫·淸償路債·增購機車車輛、均得綽然有餘、尙可以其餘欵、發展鐡路附帶經營之林礦各業、並輔𦔳各地公路之修築、則上述五項辦法、雖似局部之事、而其實促進國家興盛、發展地方富源、均間接利賴、所望關係各方面、皆能推誠相與、經各項辦法、順利進行、固不止鐡路一方獨受其益也、</p>

<p>言</p>
<h3>賣身投靠</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>世上的事，名目雖　似好聽，而按之實際，等於市上的「廉價大賤賣」同一性質者，其事至夥，</p>
<p>昨據報載，内政部公布禁蓄奴婢辦法八條，這事若驟然聽見，必定大家拍手贊同，倘若側頭一想，就不免要發生許多莑問，所謂禁蓄奴婢，就是禁止賣身投靠，三笑姻緣中的唐伯虎，賣身投靠不必說，雙珠鳳中的文必正，賣身投靠，亦是例外，</p>
<p>若同是一人，何人甘爲奴甘爲婢，即其父母，亦何忍把愛的結晶之子女，賣身投靠，送給人家，任人使喚，其中必有不得已之苦衷，旣不能易子而食，又不能析骸而炊，没有辦法，只得把子女賣身投靠，送給有錢的人家，作爲奴婢，這原是日暮途窮，莫可奈何的勾當，</p>
<p>至於賣身投靠之制，我國雖有此惡習，然而以我所聞，並非若何慘無人道之舉，蓄奴如何，尙無所聞，苈蓄婢之制，確是耳熟能詳，蓄婢有兩種，一種活典，一種絶賣，活典者以幾年爲期，期滿取贖，若絶賣者，其婢到相當年齡，其主人爲之擇配，如主僕相得者，往往薄具妝奩，爲之遣嫁，仍如親眷一般，至於虐待婢女，投河自盡等事，雖偶有所聞，亦屬例外也，</p>
<p>是以我國雖有賣身投靠之制，實無異固定之傭，現欲解除此制，我先欲問，該奴婢在家庭中之生活，與在主人家的生活比較若何，該奴婢因爲在家不能生活，所以賣身投靠，現在仍欲遣送回家，是否爲該奴婢所願意，如曰送之救濟院，則救濟院中之待遇如何，我固不得而知，試問救濟院是否能夠常住，而并可以容納多人，亦殊疑問，</p>
<p>總之欲解决賣身投靠，應該先要解决他們生活問題，譬如前日政令，剷除这信，欲把幾位卜卦拆字的瞎眼先生，改換職業，業非笑話，現在有幾位大學裏畢業出來學識豐富的大學生、尙且没有飯吃，尙没有事做，而欲使幾位瞎眼先生，改習行業，豈不是白白裏送他們到死路上去麽，</p>
<p>以上的話，並不是反對禁蓄奴婢，亦不是反對剷除迷信，不過要取消一種制度，任何惡劣的制度，先要同他們尋出一條切實的生路，方可辦理，否則仍舊是「廉價大賤賣」同一有名無實而巳，</p>

<h3>樅樹仿造木棉法</h3>
<p>— 江天覽</p>
<p>木棉價值是很昂貴的，市上每磅至少售洋六七角以上，苟能仿造此項木棉，所得的代價，保證有特殊的利益的，</p>
<p>棉本來是一種有機物、凡一切含有纎維質的植物，都可利用製造棉花，但植物中當以樅樹最佳，因其纎維質較他種植物爲多，若以此仿造木棉，實爲無上的原料，</p>
<p>法將樅樹去皮去節，用機械細切其枝，成爲細片放在長度三十九尺，直徑十三尺的圓筒形的銅器中，銅器中預先敷一層鉛，通進蒸氣，約三十六個小時，木質巳變白色，淸水洗過，取槌敲碎，乃用漂白粉將其漂白，再將壓水櫃壓榨，乾燥後，即成爲純粹的纎維質，</p>
<p>但所得的纎維質，是没有光澤和粘力，如果要光澤粘力，可加鋅綠，鹽酸，醋酸，調和入桶，並加相當的熱度，或再加下一些膠水，自會有粘性，而且略帶糊狀，投入器内，加極重的壓力，製成細絲，</p>
<p>於是將此細絲狀之物，入於淡鹼水中，使從圓筒内經過，即用蒸氣烘乾，再經過阿摩尼亞水、纎維已極堅固、取水洗凈，乾後可任意染種種顔色，但纎維不及天然長，是爲美中缺點，不過一層，造法不繁，藥料亦狠價賤，有志仿造此項木棉的，不妨作一次小試騐、方知鄙人所說的話，並非子虚啊，</p>

<p>貴刊提出這樣的一個問題來公開討論，眞是多麽有價值，有意義，我不禁爲天眞爛漫的兒童們祝福，舜池，史娜二君所提供的關於該問題的意見，都井井有條，匠心獨具，使我不得不感佩他們爲兒童造福的努力。不過，對於他們所討論的讀物的範圍，和史娜君的結論二點，我覺得更有補充伸說的必要。　　一，兒童讀物的範圍，史娜，舜池二君，斤斤於小朋友等定期刊物的爭執，好像除了這種定期刊物以外，便没有兒童讀物似的，這便大錯了，照我說來，凡是以供給兒童閱讀爲目的面出版的書籍，只消是兒童歡迎牠，高興去看牠的，都可說是兒童讀物。所以小朋友等定期刊物，小學生叢書之類，是兒童讀物，七劍十三俠，西遊記連環圖畫，也是兒童讀物。我們旣是在討論改良的問題，便不應該把範圍囿於一隅。自然，在一般敎育家看來，征東，征西之類，是太落伍，太不合時宜，甚至於說是戕賊兒童，斵喪兒童的東西，可是，我們就能以成年人的資格，來禁止兒童閱讀嗎？你聽，兒童不是在高聲嚷着「看了天寳圖，忘記肚子餓」嗎！兒童讀物的好壞，老實說我們成年人没有批評的資格，我們應當把讀物放在兒童面前試騐。征東征西是兒童所歡迎的，在兒童看來，便是很好的讀物，我們如何能主觀的，武斷的，把這種東西，關在兒童讀物的門牆之外？而不把牠放在討論範圍内。兒童世界等定期刊物，充滿着鳥言獸語，與西遊記等到處都是妖魔鬼怪，又有什麽兩樣，又進步在那裏？（詳下節）以同樣必須再事改良的東西，而必須捨彼取此，這怎樣說得通呢？所以，我們對於討論的範圍，要擴大。</p>
<p>二，獸言鳥語比神仙妖怪進步嗎史娜君說：「現在的兒童讀物，應淘汰神仙妖怪，而代以獸言鳥語，並灌輸以一般常識。」又說：「獸言鳥說，是引起閱讀興趣的最大工具，能借此灌輸以多量常識的，就是需要的作品」更說：一神仙妖怪的材料，雖多半含有道德的敎訓，但究屬利弊參半，無登載價值。」不錯，神仙妖怪的材料，的確荒唐怪誕，不近人情，不切事理，而無登載價值，但是，史娜君何以見得獸言鳥語的材料，便合於人情，切近事理，而硬着頭頸說淘汰神仙妖怪，代以獸言鳥語。像孫行者那般會七十二變化一個觔斗便遠去十萬八千里的神怪，果然是幻想中的人物，巨奈公冶長那般能聽鳥言獸語的人，我們就以爲是立在地上的嗎？神仙妖怪與鳥言獸語，相去究竟幾何？况且神仙妖怪，正同鳥言獸語的材料，一樣能引起兒童的閱讀興趣，鳥言獸語，那裏是「最大工具」啊！再者，常識與道德，我覺得有同樣的重要。史娜君說得未免又太滑稽了罷！怎麽可以斷定以同樣一種能引起兒童閱讀興趣的材料，如果灌輸以常識，便是需要的，而含有道德敎訓，便無登載價值，便是利弊參半呢！</p>
<p>我的結論是：現在的鳥言獸語的兒童讀物，在形式的取材上，不比一妖怪神仙」的讀物，有顯着的進步。所以我們的討論範圍，應該儘量擴大。如果說：憑着鳥言獸語的形式而輸以一般常識的是好的兒童作品；那末，能利用神仙鬼怪的材料而注入道德的敎訓或一般常識的，也便是好的作品。不滿意於神仙妖怪的材料，就是爲一鳥言獸語」掘墳墓。</p>
<p>讀者諸君以爲如何？</p>

<h3>街頭的活劇</h3>
<p>— 人</p>
<p>上海的黑幕，眞是層出不窮，單就欺騙，敲竹槓，已是花樣愈出愈巧，越演越新，而漸趨於藝術化了。初到上海或是不脫土老兒氣味的仁兄，若是落了他們的圈套，那可要霉頭觸足！</p>
<p>這裏，將告訴你一幕街頭騙詐的活劇。地點在一段閙市，但左近找不出一個巡警的踪影兒；時間是一個初秋晴天的黄昏；我們的主角是一位充溢十分「土」氣味的Ｂ。</p>
<p>幕開了；在一家緊閉着鐡門的石庫高牆邊，圍着一堆人——有男的，女的，長衫的短褲的，他們的衆目，睽睽地共同一條視線注視着被包圍的一個中年瞎子手中的金表。我們的長衫靑年Ｂ君，他一心一意想佔便定貨，也混雜在人堆裏，眼晴看着，心裏劃算着。瞎子在哀求地喊：</p>
<p>「可憐我瞎子命苦呀！房産毁於砲火，父母弟妹死在矮子槍下，苦命的我又被敵人綁去剜去雙目，雖幸而不死，可呌我往後怎樣生活呀！這只表是先父生平最心愛最寳貴的东西，如今禍出非常，爲着要求延續這殘喘的一息，只得狠心忍痛廉價出售，那位仁人君子慈善爲心，救我瞎子一命，只需給我十元，便願以此奉讓······」</p>
<p>這一套唱得Ｂ心中癢索索的；伸手欲接過表來瞧瞧，腦司令已頒下「决買便宜貨」的命令，眉目間微映着愉快的影子。</p>
<p>「先生要買表，我瞎子感激不盡：但恕我瞎子看不見，無以辨人心，請讓我揑住先生的衣襟。」這是情中之理。Ｂ同意後接過表來托在掌上反覆地審查機件和質地，正待開口，忽然間，人堆背後伸出一隻巨掌搶了表便向東跑，Ｂ心裏急得火從眼珠冒出，拔脚排開人衆欲追，可是衣襟死死地給瞎子扭住不放；并聲聲地向Ｂ哀求：</p>
<p>「先生千萬不要尋我瞎子開心，可憐我瞎子快要餓死了。先生不買，請將原表還我吧。」</p>
<p>糾纒間，兩個黑香雲紗短衣褲的漢子出現了。他們慣會管閒事地，又活像法官宣判般的口吻向Ｂ：「朋友，漂亮些，人家瞎子怪可憐的，爽爽氣氣的賠吧，這只可怪你自己不小心呀！」</p>
<p>兩張伍元鈔票飛進瞎子腰包的時候，瞎子堆下滿臉的笑容，摸索着朝東去了；看熱鬧的人衆和那兩個活像法官的漢子充滿了得意的神色，飛着獰猙的笑鳥獸般地散了；只有我們的Ｂ沮喪着苦臉，帶着頽廢灰敗的心蹣跚地歸來。</p>

<p>Liu Zhennian's Troops Shorten Defense Line</p>
<p>Two Brigades of Han's Troops Reach Suburbs of Yexian County</p>
<p>Chiang Telegraphed Liu Zhennian to Endure and Handle the Situation</p>
<p>Chiang Bo-cheng, on Chiang's Orders, Goes to Weixian to Meet Han</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to news received today regarding the conflict between Han and Liu, Liu Zhennian has complied with the telegram orders from Chairman Chiang and Minister He, and has withdrawn his troops to the rear to avoid conflict. Han's troops are pressing forward relentlessly, causing extreme anger among Liu's officers and soldiers, who are willing to engage in battle. However, Liu Zhennian is still doing his utmost to restrain them, hoping for a peaceful resolution. Nevertheless, the situation is extremely tense. Liu's army is only leaving a small number of troops to defend Yantai, Fushan, and Muping, with the rest being transferred to the front line. Han's military plan is to quickly resolve the Liu problem using a blitzkrieg method. However, since the September 18th Incident, Liu has made considerable preparations for military installations in Jiaodong. Upon noticing Han's actions, he immediately concentrated his forces during the brief period, while shortening the defense line and strengthening fortifications. Although the front lines of both sides are not far apart after Han's troops moved into Pingdu and Changyi, there has been no formal contact to date. It is reported that Chairman Chiang has repeatedly telegraphed Han and Liu, saying that he has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth and make decisions accordingly, urging them to cease hostilities to prevent the outbreak of war and avoid further suffering for the people, and instructing Liu to exercise extreme patience and await a fair resolution from the central government. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin has dispatched senior staff officers of the Military Affairs Commission, such as Li Jialie, to Jinan and Yantai to investigate the truth. They departed on the 20th. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two brigades of Han's army, led by Ma Guanyi and Li Zhanbiao, have reached outside the city of Yexian. Zhao's brigade of Liu's troops is stationed inside the city, with trenches and fortifications dug, providing strong defenses. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shandong states that the Third Route Army's reserve team continued to move forward on the 20th. There are still over a thousand enemy troops in Yexian, relying on fortifications to resist. The commander personally went to Shahe in the morning of the 20th to command, and there has been no major contact at the front. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu's troops in Laiyang are fighting with self-defense forces, and order is extremely chaotic. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) It is rumored that Liu's army has abandoned Yexian and retreated to the east. It is said that they looted extensively before retreating, but there has been no official confirmation by telegram. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Liu's army is holding the east-west defense line from Ma'anshan to Laizhou, while Han's army is advancing from Shahe and Pingdu. It is generally expected that the small skirmishes that have already occurred may soon lead to a major war. However, other parties are currently working hard to mediate. Shen Honglie stated that the warships under his command are only being used to protect the Shandong coast, and they are maintaining neutrality. (21st Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Qingdao, Han Fuju's army has occupied the new city and towns 30 kilometers from Longkou. Liu Zhennian is now willing to negotiate peace. If Han refuses, he intends to persist to the end. (21st Reuters)</p>
<p>(Yantai) According to reliable sources, Han's and Liu's armies fought again in Laizhou this morning. Liu telegraphed the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce here, requesting the shipment of 50,000 catties of barbed wire to Laizhou. (21st Reuters)</p>
<p>Han's Army Headquarters Moved to Yongxian County</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Han Fuju's army's general headquarters moved to Yexian County on the 19th. Han himself also traveled by armored train, departing from Changyi at 9:00 AM on the 19th and heading to Yexian County. The local people, who were suffering from Liu Zhennian's heavy taxation, lined the streets to welcome Han's army into the city. (21st Dentsu)</p>
<p>Han's Army's Right Wing Occupies Pinglidian</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Han's army's right-wing troops occupied Pinglidian, northeast of Pingdu, after noon yesterday. Liu Zhennian's army retreated towards Xiadian. Some of Liu's troops were disarmed by Han's army. (21st Dentsu)</p>
<p>Han's Army's Left Wing Approaches Xincheng</p>
<p>Weixian The main force of Han's army's left wing occupied Zhuqiao at 10:00 PM last night, and further approached Xincheng, heading towards Zhaoyuan. One detachment departed towards the railway station and will reach Fanmadan tomorrow. Cao Fulin's central right-wing troops marched in the rain last night and reached Rizhuang this morning. All routes are experiencing virtually no resistance, advancing into Liu's army's territory as if entering an uninhabited land. (21st Dentsu)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Qingdao, according to reliable reports, the main force of Han's army has advanced to Dazeshan, 30 li southeast of Yexian County, and is facing Liu's army's first-line troops. The morale of Liu's army is declining, and they are gradually retreating. Liu Zhennian is planning to stop them at the second line, so he has moved the general headquarters to Dengzhou to command himself. His defenses are not very strong, and it seems that he will use the third line near Zhifu as the final defense line, constructing strong positions centered on Fushan. If so, the trend of the Shandong war situation is generally clear. (21st Dentsu)</p>
<p>Mediation of the Han-Liu Conflict is Difficult</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Liu Zhennian's side in Yantai to Beiping states that Han telegraphed Liu, asking him to cede Yexian. Liu requested that Han retreat to Weixian's original defense and discuss the matter further. Mediation is difficult. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yantai) The situation here is stable. It is generally believed that Han and Liu are currently negotiating a settlement. Unless the negotiations break down, the war will not resume. There have been no reports of engagements between the two sides in Laiyang. (21st Reuters)</p>
<p>Chiang Telegram Urges Liu Zhennian to Endure</p>
<p>(Yantai) At noon on the 20th, Liu Zhennian received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek with the following content: "The incident happened suddenly. Please endure and handle the situation. Zhongzheng has specially dispatched senior officials to investigate thoroughly. Unless it is the last resort, we should try to avoid war, shorten the defense line, and await the central government's handling and resolution. Please let me know what your current plans are. Chiang Kai-shek, Hao Chen." After receiving the telegram, Liu Zhennian immediately sent a reply telegram, which read: "I have received and understood your Hao telegram. Your Excellency's exceptional favor and concern for my humble command are beyond my ability to express gratitude. I will comply with your instructions, exercise utmost tolerance, and have already withdrawn the troops from the front lines of Shahe and Pingdu to avoid war, to live up to your command. I am now quietly awaiting Your Excellency's instructions. Unless it is the last resort, I will never allow the internal strife that would shame the nation to occur in this time of serious national crisis. I respectfully report to you, begging for your consideration. Your servant, Liu Zhennian, bows and seals." (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Xizhong telegraphed Liu Zhennian, urging him to quickly withdraw troops from Yantai and Muping, accept the orders of Chiang, Zhang, and Han, to avoid disaster for himself and his subordinates. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Han Fuju Sends Representatives to Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuju has sent Song Shiyan and Cheng Xixian to Beiping this afternoon. Song said that he was summoned back to Jinan by Han last time. The incident in Jiaodong was due to a misunderstanding. On the 14th, the provincial government received a secret report that Liu's troops were spying on Weixian. At the same time, the provincial army went to suppress bandits, and Liu's troops suddenly opened fire, leading to a conflict. Han went to the front line to inspect. The Third Route Army has reached Yexian, Laiyang, and other places. Liu's army retreated to Qixia, Xincheng, and other towns. There were only small skirmishes, no major battles. Han arrived outside Yexian yesterday, traveling between Weixian and Shahe. I will stay in Beiping briefly and then return to Jinan. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui Not Actively Mediating</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yanzhu, secretary-general of Ma Hongkui, said that Ma's mediation of the Shandong war was based on personal friendship and was not formally expressed. The rumor that Ma was actively mediating is not accurate. Moreover, the central government has already sent people to investigate and resolve the issue, so there is no need for private mediation. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chiang Bo-cheng Went to Jinan from Beiping Yesterday</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang Bo-cheng telegraphed Chiang last night, reporting on his meeting with Zhang. He immediately received a reply telegram, ordering Chiang Bo-cheng to go to Weixian as a representative to meet with Han and discuss solutions. Chiang Bo-cheng is going to Jinan tonight to meet with Han at the front line. Before departing, he telegraphed Han, reporting on Chiang and Zhang's views on the Jiaodong war, hoping for an early resolution, and that he was ordered to go to Shandong for a meeting. Han telegraphed Chiang Bo-cheng this morning, saying that this military action was taken as a last resort, but he did not mention any solutions. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang Bo-cheng told reporters at the station that he was ordered by Chiang to go to Shandong to inspect and mediate the war, so as not to expand it. He has telegraphed Han to arrange a meeting in Weixian and will arrive in Jinan tomorrow morning before proceeding to Weixian. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yaosu, Deputy Chief of Staff, discussed the Han-Liu conflict, saying that the Shandong issue is very important. The Shandong issue was included in the agenda of both the Paris Peace Conference and the Washington Conference. The Jinan Incident occurred in the 17th year of the Republic, attracting international attention. Now that the country is facing great difficulties, the Han-Liu incident has unfortunately occurred, giving foreigners an excuse. The central government has now sent Chiang Bo-cheng to mediate. It is heard that after Chiang was ordered, he went from Beiping, and it is expected that the Shandong affairs will soon be settled. If it is further delayed, the central government will have a final solution. A dispatch from a news agency here stated that Han and Liu may be open to mediation. It is rumored that Liu Zhennian's troops will be transferred to Anhui for defense, and will enter Anhui via Haizhou. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang telegraphed Chiang Bo-cheng today, saying that the Jiaodong war is undermining unity, acting freely, and is quite dissatisfied with a certain party. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After receiving instructions from Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Bo-cheng went to Jinan this afternoon to inspect the situation on the ground. Han Fuju's representative, Song Shiying, arrived in Beiping from Jinan this morning. When news reporters went to see him, Song said that the war in Eastern Shandong was a minor contact between the two sides' sentries and was not significant. Han Fuju will soon return to Jinan from the front lines. (21st Reuters)</p>
<p>Wang Fangting Replies to Chiang Bo-cheng's Telegram</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the Beijing Office of the Third Route Army Headquarters released Wang Fangting's reply to Chiang Bo-cheng: "Liu Zhennian has occupied Jiaodong for five years, disregarding the central government and the provincial government. The disturbances he caused in the 19th year can serve as a warning. Recently, the people in the area have suffered from rampant taxation and extortion, and are jointly seeking self-defense. The local bandits have also taken the opportunity to carry out large-scale activities due to Liu's usual indulgence. The Chairman is deeply concerned that the situation will become uncontrollable, so he ordered the neighboring dispatch of defense forces to jointly suppress them. However, Liu's troops regarded the defense area as their private territory and launched a fierce attack. At first, it was thought to be a misunderstanding. It was not until the Chairman personally went to Weixian to investigate that he realized their wolfish ambitions and ulterior motives. It has been found that Liu has intercepted national and provincial funds over the years, undermining the administrative system. The Chairman hopes to work together in the face of national difficulties, and is willing to make compromises on all opinions. However, the remnants of warlords are untamed, and even if he wants to avoid conflict, the situation is beyond his control. Previously, people from more than ten counties in Jiaodong and representatives of various organizations presented their accusations to the provincial government, and the documents almost filled the hall. They were all treated with courtesy. Now, upon hearing that the Chairman has arrived in Weixian, they came from afar, brought up old cases, and even joined with local people to kneel and beg, vowing to block the road and prevent his return to the province unless he is rescued from the depths of the water. The Chairman, forced by circumstances, had no choice but to follow public opinion and reorganize the army to eliminate this major scourge. This is the real situation, and I am specially reporting it for your information." (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu's Troops Telegram Reports Tranquility in the Defense Area</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian's representative in Beijing received a telegram from the Staff Department of his division on the 20th, saying, "Our division is responsible for defending Yantai and Longkou, which is of great importance. Since the national crisis, our spirit has been focused on the coast. This time, Han of Shandong secretly went to Jiaowei to send troops and launched a sudden attack. Fortunately, it was discovered early and we were not caught. Our division, mindful of the current national crisis, is determined not to provoke a civil war. Therefore, in addition to immediately ordering all units in the front defense to avoid conflict, we also telegraphed the central government, Chairman Chiang, and Minister He, reporting the details. We have now received a telegram in reply, ordering us to avoid contact and await the central government's handling. Currently, the vanguard troops of our division have withdrawn from Pingdu to the west of Yexian in accordance with the order, and all defense areas are as tranquil as ever." (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinan Local Businessmen and Residents Hold a Meeting</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, local businessmen and residents held a meeting to discuss the Jiaodong incident and reached a consensus: (1) Telegram the central government to request the transfer of Liu's troops for bandit suppression or border defense, and return the political power to the provincial government to complete the unification of provincial administration. (2) Telegram Chairman Han, requesting him to consider the people's hardships and temporarily cease military actions. (3) Telegram Liu, requesting him to announce his intention to obey the provincial government's will and implement it thoroughly. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Longkou Residents Feel Uneasy</p>
<p>(Qingdao) According to a telegram from Longkou, the local people feel quite uneasy. All shops operate as usual during the day, but all doors are closed at night. Citizens are preparing to evacuate. The Bank of Communications branch used two trucks this morning to transport cash to Zhifu. (21st Dentsu)</p>
<p>Japanese Consul-General in Jinan Warns Han Fuju</p>
<p>(Jinan) Consul-General Nishida visited Li, the Acting Chairman of Shandong Province, this morning. Acting Chairman Li said that Han Fuju would lead his main force into Longkou in two or three days. Consul-General Nishida then said that Longkou, Zhifu and other places are inhabited by Japanese and many foreigners in the city, hoping to contact the local consular corps and pay attention to avoid any accidents. Acting Chairman Li fully understood this intention and immediately telegraphed Han Fuju. (21st Dentsu)</p>
<p>Liu Army Brigade Commander Contacts to Surrender</p>
<p>(Jinan) A brigade commander and a chief of staff of Liu's army stationed in Yexian went to Shahe to visit Han and make contact to surrender. The army's progress was slow due to heavy rain. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Expressions of Telegrams from Various Groups</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Beijing has repeatedly received telegrams from local groups in Shandong Province. Those sent from Jinan or Weixian praised Han's good governance and accused Liu of wrongdoing, while those sent from Yantai claimed that Han disregarded the national crisis and provoked hostilities without cause, and praised Liu's achievements. The central government has been exchanging telegrams with Chiang for days, hoping to find a way to eliminate the war. After ascertaining the crux of the conflict between the two sides, a decision will be made on how to deal with it. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, Zhang Weicun of the Provincial Reorganization Committee telegraphed Chiang, saying that the war in Eastern Shandong has its own crux and cannot be resolved by empty words of peace. It is necessary to resolve the center of the dispute based on the facts. The situation is urgent. Please send a competent official who understands Shandong affairs as soon as possible to provide a practical and effective solution, so that the local area can be preserved and the people can be spared from suffering. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu's Army Conscripts Ships to Transport Arms</p>

<p>Japan Disregards</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement of 1907 stipulates that the appointment of the Customs Commissioner of Dalian must be approved by the Chinese Inspector General of Customs. Japan has recently been in negotiations with China to abolish this agreement, but today the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Japan has now decided not to discuss this issue with China. If China protests against the "Manchukuo" authorities taking over the Dalian Customs, Japan will reply that the 1907 agreement is invalid. Japan believes that its recognition of "Manchukuo" has foreshadowed the abolition of this agreement, so there is no room for negotiation. The spokesperson also said that Japan originally considered abolishing this agreement through negotiation before recognizing "Manchukuo", but if the Chinese authorities still consider the 1915 treaty to be invalid, then China must theoretically recognize that the 1907 agreement expired in 1923, because according to the Chinese view, Japan's lease of the Liaodong Peninsula expired in that year. The spokesperson continued that if consular jurisdiction is abolished, Japan may return the leased territory to "Manchukuo", as this move can help consolidate the position and prestige of "Manchukuo" and promote stability in the overall situation, leading to peace and prosperity. These points are Japan's main objectives (21st Reuters).</p>

<h3>International Prospects and How Our Nation Should Conduct Itself</h3>
<p>By Yuan</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo problem in East Asia and the German-French arms race problem in Europe are clearly two separate issues. However, from the perspective of the League of Nations, they are actually interconnected and tending towards unity. If the German-French arms race dispute in Europe is not resolved quickly, there will inevitably be no time to attend to East Asia. If the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo dispute in East Asia is not resolved quickly, it will also increase the difficulties of the European problem. Therefore, the current situation of the League of Nations is indeed very difficult. It is imperative to comprehensively consider both issues and seek a strategy to quell the flames of war. However, from the League of Nations' perspective, weighing the facts of both sides, the East Asian problem, while significant in its impact on the interests of the great powers, is not as acutely felt as the European problem. Mediation between China and Japan is very difficult, but mediation between Germany and France is even more thorny. Germany and France are both resolute in their stance, making it difficult to sway them. The only concern with China and Japan is that Japan possesses a formidable military force capable of triggering a world war. China, on the other hand, traditionally values peace and can be somewhat suppressed to prevent the outbreak of war. Therefore, it would be advantageous to resolve the East Asian problem first. To expedite the resolution of the East Asian problem, it is necessary to accommodate Japan's great desires, disregarding so-called justice and righteousness. Instead of achieving thorough peace, one must cater to might in pursuit of a temporary peace. Although this is speculative, observing the recent international atmosphere, such as the recent Reuters report that the League of Nations will strive to avoid conflict with Japan and agree to its request to postpone discussion of the Lytton Report, and that a certain country will follow Japan in recognizing the puppet organization, such rumors have traces of evidence to be found.</p>
<p>If this trend indeed develops in the international arena, how should our nation conduct itself? Since Germany raised the demand for military equality, the great powers have been shaken. The French press initially suspected that Britain would sympathize with Germany and show hostility. Now that Britain's response does not favor Germany, they have changed their attitude to praise, implying a tacit understanding between Britain and France. Germany initially expected Britain's response to be very lenient, but now they are greatly disappointed. However, despite their disappointment, the Germans do not retreat and are even more determined in their attitude, still insisting on their refusal to attend. This is a manifestation of Germany's strong and unyielding spirit. Since Germany possesses this strong and unyielding spirit, the League of Nations will inevitably value it and seek a way to turn things around. Do our people possess this strong and unyielding spirit? When oppression comes, can they unite as one, like the Germans, to fight for it with all their strength? If our people truly possess this spirit, it is believed that the great powers would not dare to easily oppress them. This is also clearly evident.</p>
<p>However, our people should know how to conduct themselves. Today, there is no need to hate others, only to hate our own lack of Germany's ability. There is no need to resent the great powers, only to resent our own lack of Germany's determination to strive for strength. There is also no need to be angry that the world has no right or wrong, no justice, only to be angry that we lack Germany's military strength to resist the powerful. Today, let us not discuss Germany, but rather, let us emulate it. Even the recent statements made by our opponent, Japan, are worthy of our vigilance. According to reports, the Tokyo prefectural and municipal educational organizations initiated a major public lecture on the "National Self-Reliance Movement in Extraordinary Times." At yesterday's meeting, Prime Minister Saitō said, "Thinking about our country's future, outwardly, there are many difficulties after recognizing Manchukuo; inwardly, the exhaustion of farming, fishing, and mountain villages, the distress of small and medium-sized industries and businesses, the stagnation of annual income, the continuous unemployment, and the chaos in the ideological circles are not easy to overcome... Over the past few years, the habits of extravagance and indulgence still exist, and the frivolous and impulsive atmosphere has not yet ceased. In extraordinary times, there must be an extraordinary awakening. I hope that our people will exert their spirit of perseverance and truly unite as one to overcome the difficulties. Fortunately, there is now talk of self-reliance and regeneration in various places. I hope that we will not rely solely on government subsidies and relief, but rather establish plans for regeneration step by step." Alas! The people of Japan are a people proud of their victory, yet their efforts are so great. The Prime Minister of Japan is an aging and feeble Prime Minister, yet his exhortations to the people are so profound. Then, can our people, in this extraordinary time that is ten or a hundred times greater than that of Japan, have an extraordinary awakening that is ten or a hundred times greater than that of the Japanese people? Today, our country can only hope that our people have this extraordinary awakening. Only with this awakening can we have Germany's spirit of striving for strength. As for how the League of Nations will handle the Sino-Japanese problem in the future and how the great powers will oppress our nation, we need not ask.</p>

<p>US Senator</p>
<p>Reed's Mission to Europe</p>
<p>To Persuade Britain and France</p>
<p>To Take United Action Against Japan</p>
<p>Reuters London, 21st - The Times Washington correspondent reports that the US authorities deeply sympathize with the British declaration on Germany's demand for military equality. They said that the US government regrets any action that tends to increase armaments. The British declaration has attracted public attention to the visit of US Senator Reed to London and Paris. It is heard that Reed secretly indicated yesterday to Herriot that the United States is willing to support France in rejecting Germany's demand for military equality, provided that France supports the United States' attitude towards the Far East. According to reports, Reed is one of the strongest supporters of the current government in the Senate, so if he can be induced to support any form of League of Nations pressure on Japan, it is expected that the Senate will follow suit. The correspondent also said that it is known in Washington that the cooperation between the United States and the League of Nations on the Manchurian incident last year was hindered by Senate opposition to cooperation. Secretary of State Stimson is not making any criticism of Reed's mission to Europe.

Americans speculate that if Russia supplies oil to Japan, it would be tantamount to Russia recognizing Manchukuo. Japan's military actions in Manchuria are clearly not approved by the United States. If Japan engages in war with other countries over the Far East issue in the future, Russia will not be in a position to oppose Japan. If Japan is at war with the United States, the Japanese navy must pass through the Indian Ocean or the Black Sea to import oil from Russia, so the oil transportation issue may not be as simple as the Japanese think.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st - Matsukata, the former president of Kawasaki Shipbuilding, is making good progress in Moscow in negotiating the purchase of Russian kerosene from the Soviet Russian government. The public is paying close attention to this news. It is reported today that the contract can be concluded soon, stipulating that the Soviet Union will supply Japan with 100,000 tons of kerosene, and Japan will pay for it with goods.</p>
<p>US Navy</p>
<p>Consolidates Pacific Defenses</p>
<p>Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - The US Naval Department has allocated ten million US dollars from the public works fund. Yesterday, it officially announced that one-third of it, a total of 3.33 million US dollars, will be used for military defense expenses on the Pacific coast, and will begin work immediately.</p>

<h3>English Newspaper Commentary on the Shandong War</h3>
<p>Stating that China's endless internal wars</p>
<p>Only give Japan opportunities for aggression</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st - The Manchester Guardian comments on the Shandong war, saying that if the Shandong warlords are not actually being manipulated by the Japanese, it gives Tokyo an excellent opportunity. Internal wars in China are common, but the Shandong turmoil is of particular importance, as Japanese soldiers and imperialists are very covetous of the Shandong Peninsula. The transfer of military forces to North China will benefit the Japanese forces and Japanese diplomats in the Northeast, it is said.</p>
<p>Change of Japanese Finance Minister</p>
<p>Saito's position wavering</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - According to rumors from the stock market, Finance Minister Takahashi, who is currently resting in Hayama, may not be able to attend the next regular Diet session due to old age and illness. It is rumored that the Saito cabinet will take the opportunity to appoint Mitsuchi Tetsuya as the next Finance Minister. There are also rumors that some people are recommending that Home Minister Yamamoto succeed as Finance Minister, and that the nobles in the House of Peers believe that since the special Diet session has ended and the recognition of Manchukuo has been implemented, Prime Minister Saito must liquidate the abnormal national unity cabinet, etc. Therefore, the turmoil in the political situation is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Japanese Minseito Party Decides to Support the Current Cabinet</p>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - The Japanese Minseito Party held a Kanto convention in Tokyo at 1 p.m. today, resolving to support the Saito Cabinet to solve the current domestic and foreign difficulties in Japan.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st - The main points of President Wakatsuki's speech at the Kanto convention today are as follows: (1) China should be responsible for the independence of Manchukuo, and it is natural for Japan to recognize Manchukuo and hope for its development. (2) The current state of the financial world is unstable due to fluctuations in currency value. Stabilizing exchange rates requires establishing a fiscal foundation and improving international lending. (3) To alleviate the world's economic difficulties, a world economic conference should be convened as soon as possible, and Japan should also participate. (4) Oppose all forms of dictatorial politics.</p>
<p>President Hayashi of South Manchuria Railway Plots to Cling to His Post</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - President Hayashi of South Manchuria Railway visited Chief Cabinet Secretary Shibata at 2:30 p.m. today to discuss his upcoming return to office and the issue of his resignation, etc. Afterwards, the president told reporters that it was rumored that he would resign, but he would absolutely not resign at this time. He is currently waiting for the resolution of issues being negotiated with the government, and plans to return to office as soon as possible before the 29th. As for the matter of the president of South Manchuria Railway, it has not yet begun, and to say whether he is suitable or not is truly ridiculous. As for the board of directors, it is different from before and related to the military, so it is difficult for him to decide individually, etc.</p>
<p>Movement to Reform the Conscription System</p>
<p>Wealthy Heirs Live in Luxury</p>
<p>Young Military Officers Express Discontent</p>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - The real power within the Japanese Army Ministry has always been monopolized by the Choshu faction of military cliques. From the minister to the section chiefs, it has almost formed a complete Choshu clique, which has aroused great dissatisfaction among local military officers. Recently, since the rise of the Saga faction of Mutō, Araki, etc., within the Army Ministry, they have been trying hard to eliminate the remnants of the Choshu faction. In particular, the young military officers under the Araki faction have taken the opportunity to advocate internal reforms. Japan is nominally a nation of universal conscription in law, but in reality, the sons of capitalists and nobles have mostly never served in the military. Those who shed blood and sacrifice themselves on the battlefield are mostly the sons of laborers and peasants. Not only can the noble and capitalist classes avoid being in the trenches, but they can also profit without effort. Recently, the general lower-ranking officers have understood this point, and have taken the opportunity to advocate a thorough reform of the conscription system to prevent the laboring class from continuing to suffer losses. It is said that their influence has spread throughout the country, and there will soon be a fierce movement.</p>
<p>First Batch of Japanese Armed Immigrants</p>
<p>Receive Temporary Military Training</p>
<p>Depart for the Northeast Next Month</p>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - Most of the first batch of armed immigrant groups being prepared by the Japanese military and the Colonial Affairs Ministry have graduated from the temporary military training classes and are scheduled to depart from Tokyo on October 4th. It is said that this time, in light of the failure of the group immigration in Nagano Prefecture in mid-July this year, in addition to vividly describing the aggression to the public, they are also paying closer attention to military deployment in order to re-motivate the Japanese workers and peasants who are in despair, so that they can serve the military again.</p>
<p>Executive Committee of the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Held First Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Representatives of Various Countries Exchange Views Privately</p>
<p>German Demands for Armaments Become the Biggest Problem</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 21st - The executive committee of the Disarmament Conference met today and immediately encountered the major problem of Germany's demand for equality in armaments. However, the meeting decided not to discuss this matter for the time being, and to consider it after Chairman Henderson receives Germany's reply. It is reported that Henderson recently sent a letter to the German government, expressing his regret for Germany's non-participation in the executive committee meeting, and asking the German government to reconsider its decision, because if Germany is absent for a long time, the future of world disarmament will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Geneva, 21st - Chairman Henderson of the Disarmament Conference convened a meeting of the executive committee today to discuss the preparation for the formal reopening of the Disarmament Conference and the establishment of working procedures. The meeting opened at 11:00 a.m., but the German representative did not attend. Other representatives attending included British Foreign Secretary Simon, American Wilson, Japanese Ambassador Sato, French Army Minister Boncour, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, and Italian Rosso. The meeting first opened in secret, and then changed to a public meeting after a while. Many journalists entered the room. French Prime Minister Herriot did not attend.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 21st - A German government spokesman stated that the German government intends not to reply to the letter from Chairman Henderson of the Disarmament Conference and to wait and see how things develop, hoping that the results of negotiations in Geneva will remove some obstacles to Germany's demand for equality in armaments and automatically open the way for Germany to rejoin the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 20th - The executive committee of the Disarmament Conference will meet tomorrow. Today, French Prime Minister Herriot and British Foreign Secretary Simon have both gone to Geneva. Although their talks are informal and confidential, they will inevitably involve the main points of the disarmament problem. Herriot does not want to directly participate in the formal discussions in Geneva, but wants to personally contact the chief representatives of various countries. This morning, Herriot received Japanese Ambassador to France Nagaoka and Italian Ambassador Morano. The Japanese and Italian ambassadors are also in Geneva to attend the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Geneva, 20th - Tonight, Chairman Henderson of the Disarmament Conference formally denied the rumor that the executive committee meeting would be postponed, stating that the meeting is scheduled to reconvene at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, and a secret meeting will be held first. As for the future meetings of the committee, nothing is known at this time, but it is believed that they will be held publicly. At this time, the subcommittee on reducing military expenditures is meeting in secret. It is reported that a resolution was passed today, acknowledging Japan's request to treat all expenditures for what it calls protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents as special expenses and not to include them in the regular military budget. Japanese representative Sato stated that Japan was forced to spend huge sums of money in order to protect its interests in Manchuria and Shanghai, and this money must not be included in the regular military budget, otherwise it will give the world a misleading impression of Japan's military expenditures.</p>
<p>Swedish Social Democratic Leader</p>
<p>Ordered to Form a New Cabinet</p>
<p>Politics Gradually Leaning to the Left</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Stockholm, 20th - Today, the Swedish King ordered Social Democrat Hansson to form a new cabinet. After receiving the order, Hansson is expected to form a joint cabinet of the Social Democratic Party and the Farmers' Party on Wednesday. According to the results of the Swedish parliamentary re-election on Sunday, the Social Democratic Party and the Farmers' Party together occupy 116 seats in the entire 230-seat chamber. Since public opinion has a significant leftward inclination, the right-wing Prime Minister Hamlin, who had been in office for only a short time, had to resign.</p>
<p>Dutch Parliament Opens</p>
<p>Communist Party Members Make a Racket</p>
<p>Shouting Slogans to Overthrow the Queen</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, The Hague, 20th - Today, a very unusual incident occurred during the opening ceremony of the Dutch Parliament. When the Queen finished her address, all the Communist Party members suddenly stood up and shouted slogans to overthrow the monarch and overthrow the Queen. They were forcibly expelled by the ushers. Then, all the other members of the two houses stood up and sang the national anthem to show their loyalty. Outside the meeting place, there were also Communist Party members preparing to riot, and all the police were immediately dispatched by the authorities to suppress and disperse them. Afterwards, the Queen and her consort returned to the palace in a carriage, and a large number of soldiers were dispatched to cooperate with the police to guard the route. In the Queen's address, there was a markedly pessimistic tone regarding the end of the economic downturn, and it was expected that public expenditures would be drastically reduced.</p>
<p>Second Day of Gandhi's Fast</p>
<p>Issue of Voting Rights for the Untouchables</p>
<p>Various Parties are Rushing to Negotiate</p>
<p>Reuters, Pune, 21st - Gandhi started his fast yesterday. He woke up early this morning and was still in good shape. During the day, he received several guests. It is hoped that Gandhi will stop his fast soon with the help of these people, as a compromise on the issue of voting rights for the lower classes seems to be imminent. Among the guests today were the famous Liberal Party leader Sir Sapru and Jayakar, who talked with Gandhi for two hours and put forward a new plan to convene a meeting of Indian leaders in Bombay. It is now believed that this plan can also be accepted by the lower classes.</p>
<p>Reuters, Pune, 20th - Gandhi began his fast in Yerwada Jail today. Gandhi has been imprisoned since January 3rd this year, for nine months now. Today, the authorities allowed him to meet with newspaper representatives for the first time. Gandhi was in good spirits and told the representatives, "I am a citizen of India, but I am willing to serve the untouchables. The untouchables have the same beliefs as the Indians, but they have no ability to defend themselves. The Indians have repeatedly bullied them. To atone for the sins of the Indians, it would not be too much to sacrifice more than a hundred lives. What is my personal life worth?" Regarding the issue of the untouchables, a telegram from Bombay stated that the Indian leaders' conference had formulated a plan for the representation of the untouchables, which the untouchables might accept. It will be submitted to Gandhi for approval tomorrow. It is possible that a compromise can be reached between the two sides, and Gandhi can therefore end his fast.</p>
<p>Plot to Bomb the Express Train Between Germany and Russia</p>
<p>Shell Placed on the Tracks</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Driver Was Alert and Avoided the Disaster</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Riga, 20th - It has just been learned that on Monday evening, when the Moscow-Berlin express train was passing near Dvinsk in Latvia, someone attempted to bomb the train. The train was carrying a large amount of gold from Russia to German banks. Fortunately, the driver was alert and spotted an obstacle on the track. He quickly accelerated and pushed it off the track. It was later found that it was a shell left over from the European War, tied to the track. If it had exploded, its force would have been enough to destroy most of the entire train. The police have not yet apprehended the mastermind.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Going to Shahe to Supervise the Troops</h3>
<p>Cao Fulin's Army Has Crossed Yexian and is Advancing Eastward</p>
<p>All Circles in Shandong Telegraph Both Sides Calling for Peace</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After Liu Zhennian's army withdrew from Pingdu, it joined forces with the garrison in Yexian and built defensive fortifications there to contain the advance. Han Fuqu arrived in Shahe on the 19th to supervise the troops. Cao Fulin's route crossed Yexian and went east. The provincial party department telegraphed the central government, asking it to order Liu to hand over political power. The gentry and business circles also decided to telegraph both sides, calling for peace and cessation of hostilities to resist foreign aggression. A compilation of news from all sides is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Liu's Army Retreating Eastward: According to a phone call from Changyi, Liu Zhennian's army is retreating eastward. As of noon on the 19th, it had retreated more than 100 li from Changyi. During the retreat, many roads along the way were destroyed, and bridges were burned, causing considerable losses. The provincial army is repairing the bridges on one hand and advancing on the other. Han Fuqu is still in Changyi today. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, came from Jinan to Changyi to meet with Han and will take on the task of directing transportation.</p>
<p>Gentry and Business Circles Plead for Cessation of Hostilities: This morning, the Provincial Defense Aircraft Fundraising Committee held a standing committee meeting at the Grand View Garden. Representatives from the gentry, business, party, and government circles all attended. Zhang Weicun of the Provincial Reorganization Committee proposed an ad hoc motion, saying that the war clouds are now densely gathering in eastern Shandong, and a major battle is imminent. At this time of impending disaster, the people cannot bear to sit idly by and watch their own countrymen fight each other. They should express the people's desire for peace. It was unanimously decided to telegraph both sides, calling for peace, asking Han to be magnanimous, and advising Liu to submit and hand over political power and unanimously cease hostilities to resist foreign aggression (the telegram was drafted by Wang Moxian). If both sides reply favorably to peace, a second step will be taken to send people to both sides to negotiate peace measures. The telegram will be sent out within the day and is also a ray of dawn in the thick war clouds.</p>
<p>What Cheng and Zhang Discussed Upon Returning to Jinan: Cheng Xixian, Senior Advisor to the Provincial Government, and Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, were summoned by Han's telegram to Changyi the day before yesterday and returned to Jinan at 11 p.m. last night. According to reports, Chairman Han left Changyi for Shahe at 11:10 a.m. on the 19th. Liu's army still has defenders in Yexian. It is said that Liu's purpose in defending Yexian is to contain our army's forces. He has built underground tunnels, trenches, and other defensive fortifications in Yexian. However, Yexian is more than 500 li away from Muping, and all transportation is difficult, so it may not be possible to defend it to the end. Chen Dexin's 86th Brigade of our army will arrive in Yexian on the evening of the 19th. The 29th Division Commander Cao Fulin led the Rong Guangxing and Li Hanzhang Brigades and has already advanced east of Yexian. If Liu abandons Yexian or it is captured by our army, Chairman Han will be stationed in Yexian to command and will not return to Changyi. It is expected that within a week, the forces can encircle Liu in one corner. Chairman Han will return to Jinan once he arrives. On the 19th, Liu sent a telegram to Han in Yantai, saying "can discuss." Our side replied to Liu with a telegram from Director Liu Xizhong (Director Niu Zhao is Liu Zhennian's classmate) on a personal basis. The content is unknown, but it probably requires Liu to be transferred. Otherwise, there is nothing to discuss. After the outbreak of the war, Liu sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report, stating that Han's army had pressed on at noon on the 18th, etc. In fact, our army's advance was due to Liu's army firing first, and they retreated as soon as there was any contact. There are no major battles at the front. Chairman Han received telegrams from all sides in Changyi, including Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Minister He, and Commander-in-Chief Ma (Hongkui), mostly inquiring about the situation. The rumor that Ma was mediating is not true. The Provincial Party Department Telegrams the Central Government: The Provincial Reorganization Committee resolved at its regular meeting yesterday that, regarding Commander-in-Chief Han of the Third Route Army's campaign against Liu, it advocated requesting the Central Government to order Liu Zhennian to quickly return the administrative power of the counties in eastern Shandong to the provincial government and the military power to the Central Government. The telegram was sent that evening. The content is as follows: "Urgent, To the Central Executive Committee in Nanjing, Having read Chairman Han Fuqu of the Shandong Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army's telegram stating that Liu Zhennian, Commander of the 21st Division, has seized eastern Shandong, disrupted administration, and obstructed bandit suppression, as repeatedly appealed by the people, he was compelled to use force. We believe that today, when the national crisis is urgent and the security of North China is worrying, Shandong Province is the hub of the north and south and occupies important maritime defense positions. Its security is of great importance, and military and political affairs must be unified. Suppressing foreign aggression first requires internal stability, and separation cannot be tolerated. If Liu Zhennian is mindful of the country's difficulties and fearful of the seriousness of foreign aggression, he should immediately come to his senses and not engage in resistance. Therefore, we submit this telegram to your committee, earnestly requesting that it be forwarded to the National Government, ordering Liu Zhennian to return the administration of the counties in eastern Shandong to the Shandong Provincial Government and the troops under his command to the Central Government for investigation and handling, so as to stabilize Shandong Province and preserve the overall situation. In haste, we await your urgent orders. Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee bows,"</p>
<p>Han Fuqu's Proclamation: Chairman Han Fuqu of the Provincial Government issued a proclamation yesterday denouncing Liu Zhennian. The original text is recorded on the left: "Proclamation, It is hereby proclaimed that the chairman was ordered to come to Shandong and has been here for more than two years. Times are difficult, and I am deeply concerned about shortcomings. I have examined myself and dare not claim credit. Eliminating violence and pacifying the people has never been neglected. Elders and brothers, you have all seen and heard this. In recent years, harvests have been abundant, and banditry has gradually decreased. The counties in the west, south, and north of the province have been personally inspected, and the hardships of the people have also been gradually alleviated. However, it has been found that Liu Zhennian has been stationed in Yantai for five years, engaging in excessive taxes, harsh punishments, and arbitrary assessments, causing countless families to be ruined. The provincial government has received indictments from the people of various counties and letters and telegrams of complaint from all sides, enough to fill a room. At a time when the country is in trouble, what cannot be tolerated? However, the people of the Dengzhou and Laizhou regions are suffering deeply, and banditry is rampant. Since it is all Shandong land and all Shandong people, the chairman's responsibility lies in not being able to sit idly by. Now, the said division has actually attacked the headquarters' bandit suppression troops head-on, using formal senior military officers to harm the people and aid the bandits, and disturb the local area. If we do not carry out a major punitive expedition, how can we respect national discipline and protect the lives of the people? Therefore, the commander-in-chief is personally leading his troops to carry out a punitive expedition in separate routes. The only one to be blamed is Liu Zhennian. If the other officers and soldiers of the said division have a deep understanding of righteousness and withdraw and return, they will be treated equally without regard to the past. The army will not commit the slightest offense. If anyone dares to violate orders and disturb the people, they will be dealt with according to military law and will not be shown leniency. In order to maintain the administrative system and alleviate local suffering, the chairman hopes that all sectors of the people will understand this intention and hereby issue this proclamation to inform all."</p>
<p>Joint Telegram from Various Department Heads: Today, the heads of various departments of the provincial government jointly telegraphed the central government, listing Liu Zhennian's crimes and requesting his dismissal and investigation. The telegram is as follows: "We have found that Liu Zhennian, Commander of the 21st Division, holds troops in Yantai as if it were a separate kingdom, disregarding the people's livelihood and treating laws and decrees like worn-out shoes. For two years, his crimes of extorting wealth and oppressing the people are too numerous to mention. We will only mention the major ones within the scope of administration. The commander of the said division has appointed his own private individuals to the posts of more than a dozen coastal county magistrates, making appointments and removals according to his own wishes, disregarding provincial orders, and disrupting political discipline. He has also appointed his officers and adjutants as chiefs of public security bureaus and leaders of people's militia, using the prohibition of opium and gambling as pretexts to impose exorbitant fines, harbor bandits, and falsely accuse the innocent of theft. The solicitation of donations and the gathering of wealth are appalling. He also recruits soldiers privately to expand his power, forcibly requisitions vehicles and horses, and assigns households to provide tenants. The people's self-defense firearms are all searched for, causing resentment to boil and the people to be unable to make a living. This is the first way in which he controls civil administration. The defense zone of the said division is Fushan and other twelve counties. The said division commander, under the pretext of military expenditures, has withheld all the land tax revenue and various taxes, and has also levied supplies. According to the records of each county for the 20th year, more than 5.2 million yuan has been allocated per mu. Of this year's land tax, more than one million yuan has been intercepted, not including the deed taxes for July and August. The national supply is treated as private property. This is the second way in which he disrupts finance. There is a need to establish an automobile road bureau for the business and transportation route from Weihaiwei to Shidao, and the department has already appointed a director, but the said division considers it to be within its defense line and imposes various restrictions, ultimately leading to its abandonment. The Yantai-Weihsien automobile road is an important transportation route in this province, but it is occupied as private property. Of the income for two years, only 3,000 yuan has been remitted to the department, with the rest going into private pockets. Even the main line of the Jiaolai District Road Bureau, from Yantai to Laiyang, has not been returned to this day, preventing road administration from being drawn up</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>One, this is the third way in which he destroys construction. Jiaodong has always been known as a region of culture, with schools standing tall. Since the arrival of the said division commander, schools at all levels have been obstructed. Recently, at Qixia Middle School, due to a minor dispute, the said division commander used oppressive means to cut and injure several students, and also disrupted Yantai No. 8 Middle School, directing military police to interfere in school affairs, hoping to obtain the school. To this day, the students cannot attend classes, delaying young people, which is no small matter. This is the fourth way in which he destroys education. Yantai Longkou and the towns and counties of Jiaodong have long been known for their thriving commerce. The said division commander extorts huge sums of money every month, draining the marrow and sucking the bones. The fishing industry has the heavy burden of the flag fee for going to sea, while merchants are afraid of his licentiousness and dare not open up new businesses. Agricultural and industrial affairs have all come to a standstill. The cooperative society guidance office and the weights and measures verification office have not been able to be promoted as scheduled. The insatiable greed of one person has led to the endless losses of the public. This is the fifth way in which he exploits industrialists. In other matters, such as disrupting judicial administration and preventing the courts from being established as scheduled, and interfering in the progress of litigation, causing the administration of the various counties to continue along the old ways, he is arrogant and unrestrained and does everything he can. As for his double-dealing and his long-held fence-sitting policy, he has no personality to speak of. In July of the 19th year, when the Third Route Army was fighting hard to support itself in the Qingzhou and Weixian area, the said division commander sent troops to fill the area between Pingdu and Gaomi, ostensibly to help the war effort, but in reality, he wanted to take the opportunity to cut off the railway and put the National Army in a desperate situation. Fortunately, Army Commander Li Yunheng obeyed Commander-in-Chief Chiang's order to provide swift assistance, and the National Army was able to turn the corner. The past events are all there, and they can be counted one by one. We believe that the country cannot lose its discipline for a single day, and the political system cannot be disrupted for a single day. We, as members of the provincial government, each have our own duties, and are responsible for the implementation of all policies. As a member of the provincial committee, the said division commander should work together with one heart and mind to plan progress, but instead, he occupies territory and acts as a local tyrant. When something happens, he hesitates and watches, and when nothing happens, he gathers wealth and enriches himself privately, destroying provincial administration and destroying the local area. Not only does he not have the provincial government in his eyes, but he has long had no central government in his eyes. In order to respect national discipline and protect the lives of the people, we can only implore the central government to issue a clear order to strip Liu Zhennian of all his concurrent posts and order the Third Route Army to strictly arrest and investigate him, in order to warn others and make an example. We await your urgent orders. Li Shuchun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Shandong Provincial Government, Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Finance Department, Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, He Siyuan, Director of the Education Department, Wang Fangting, Director of the Industry Department, Committee Member Zhang Yun, Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, bows, (September 20th)"</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The armies of Han and Liu have been in formal contact in the vicinity of Changyi, Yexian and Pingdu since the 17th. The combined main force of Han's army, composed of Gu Liangmin's 22nd Division, Cao Fulin's 29th Division, and Qiao Lizhi's 74th Division, began to advance eastward from Weixian, and the vanguard has already reached Xinhe. A detachment has also been dispatched from Gaomi, advancing towards Pingdu. Rong Guangxing's 87th Brigade, stationed in Jiaoxian, has already reached Liujiazhuang. In addition, Sun Tongxuan's 20th Division and Zhan Shutang's 81st Division have also joined the battle, each sending a brigade, totaling no less than 50,000 men. Han's army issued a general offensive order at 2 p.m. on the 17th, and the battle line reached approximately 84 kilometers. Liu's army's first line of defense was originally set up in the area of Pingdu, Shahe, and Changyi. Now, due to Han's army's advance and unfavorable battle conditions, it has abandoned the first line of defense and retreated to the second line of defense (near Yexian). After Liu's army retreated, a regiment in Pingdu was disarmed by Han's army, and Han's army's vanguard has already entered Yexian. Liu Zhennian, due to the urgency of the battle situation, has rushed to the front to supervise the battle and ordered the motorcade to transport troops and a large number of military supplies from Yantai and Longkou to the front line in preparation for prolonged resistance. Han's army's headquarters is located in Weixian City, and its radio team is located in Dingjia Garden in the city to communicate with the front line. Han has already borrowed 50,000 yuan from the local chamber of commerce due to insufficient military funds. The local people still feel stable, but generally, those with assets have taken their valuable treasures and come to Qingdao to seek refuge since the outbreak of war. (19th)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Bandit Suppression in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces</h3>
<p>The Red Bandits in the Three Provinces Will Soon Be Completely Eliminated</p>
<p>Regarding the Red Bandits in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, since the combined forces began their overall suppression, they have suffered successive defeats, and all important towns and cities have been recovered. The bandit scourge in the three provinces will soon be completely eliminated. The situation in various aspects is described below:</p>
<p>(1) The bandit leaders Xu Xiangqian, Kuang Jixun, and others, who were entrenched in the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, have been successively attacked by the national army in western Anhui and southern Henan since the end of June. The national army have recovered places such as Huoqiu, Sujiabu, and Hanbaidu in western Anhui, and Longsheng Town and Xuanhuadian in southern Henan. At that time, the national army in eastern Hubei had also completed their concentration. Consequently, on August 6th, the armies from eastern Hubei, southern Henan, and western Anhui launched a general offensive. The bandits suffered successive defeats, and within a month or so, places such as Dushan Town, Mabu, Zhufo'an, Wuqi River in Anhui Province, Hekou Town, Huang'an, Qiliping, Luotian, and Yingshan in eastern Hubei, and Popi River in southern Henan were recovered one after another. Recently, Xinji and Shangcheng, the military and political centers of the Red Bandits, have also been captured. The remaining bandits have fled into their old lair in Jinjiazhai, and there is extreme panic within the bandit ranks. Several people surrender with their guns every day. At this moment, the armies are encircling and suppressing Jinjiazhai and will soon wipe them out.</p>
<p>(2) The bandit leaders He Long, Duan Dechang, and others, who were causing trouble in the areas north and south of the Xiang River, claimed to have tens of thousands of men. After the national army eliminated the bandits entrenched in Diaocha Lake in June, they launched an offensive in early July. They first destroyed important bandit nests in places such as Huibutou, Zhangjie Canal, Qianjiang, Zhoulaoju, Qujiawan, and Zhuhe, seizing more than 10,000 guns and countless prisoners, horses, and supplies. Currently, the two bandits He and Duan are leading over two thousand remnants and fleeing towards Nanzhang, where they have been surrounded by various units of the national army and will soon be eliminated. The remaining bandits who fled into Honghu only have about a thousand men with guns, and the 48th Division is sending teams into the lake to search and suppress them. It is expected that they will be completely eliminated within a few days.</p>
<p>(3) In southern Hubei, there is a group of bandits led by Kong Hechong, who often harass the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Since May, after the national army launched an offensive, they have successively recovered places such as Yinzhu, Liuren, and Tongcheng. Recently, Sanxikou has also been captured. Currently, over a thousand remnants of Kong's bandits have fled to the border between Liuyang and Wanzai, where they are being encircled and suppressed by the Hunan army. One group has also retreated into their old lair in Longgang, and the armies in southern Hubei are currently encircling and suppressing the bandit lair in Longgang. Their complete elimination can be expected soon. (Attached map below)</p>
<h3>Record of the Public Funeral of Tian Tong</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Hankou: The coffin of the late National Government member, Tian Ziqin, arrived in Hankou by ship from Shanghai on the 16th of this month. It was then moved to Wuchang and placed at the Yuema Factory. On the 19th, people from all walks of life held a public memorial service. Central representatives Zhang Ji, Xia Douyin, National Government Executive Yuan representative Xia Douyin, Chairman Chiang's representative Chen Xizeng, Central Committee members Fang Juehui, Shi Ying, Pacification Commander He Chengjun, Provincial Committee members Kong Geng, Li Shucheng, and members of the provincial and municipal party headquarters, totaling several hundred people, attended the service. White horses and plain carriages filled the streets and lanes. On the 20th, the coffin was moved to Hongshan for a public funeral ceremony. This was the first public funeral in Hubei Province, and the etiquette was extremely grand. At 8:00 AM that day, Tian's family invited Zhang Ganxian, member of the Party and Government Committee and director of the Supervisory Office, to perform the ceremony of "dotting the spirit tablet," followed by a family memorial service. At 10:30 AM, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Central Committee members Zhang Ji and Shi Ying, visited the Hongshan Cemetery and paid respects at the resting place of the coffin. After the ceremony, they rested briefly before leaving. At 11:00 AM, Xia Douyin and others arrived and moved the coffin for departure. The procession was very grand. Zhang Ji, Fang Juehui, and others held the ropes of the hearse and personally escorted it. Zhang wore a "Taiping robe" made of Shandong silk, which resembled the inner gown worn by the Cantonese, but was lengthened to the knees. More than ten thousand other people attended the funeral. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, they arrived at Hongshan. The cemetery is located on the left side of Baotong Temple, below the Hongshan Temple Pagoda, on the eastern foot of the mountain. After entering the gate, there is a tomb path about ten feet wide, with rows of evergreen trees on both sides. There is a memorial pool nearby, with an inscription by He Chengjun, named "Qin Pool," engraved on a stone tablet. Ascending the steps, there is a pavilion after about a dozen steps. The spirit tablet stands majestically in the middle, with an inscription written by Yang Shukan and a seal inscription by Zhang Binglin, written by Tian's younger brother, Jiwei, totaling over two thousand words, which narrates Tian's life in great detail. The stone engraving has just been completed. Passing the memorial pavilion is the tomb path, with pine and cypress trees providing shade on both sides, creating an extremely beautiful landscape. The tomb is constructed here, made of granite, round in shape, surrounded by stone walls, with eight stone lions on the left and right. In front of the tomb, there is a stone table and an iron cauldron, gifted by Zhang Nanxian and one hundred and twenty-one others, with many inscriptions. Behind the tomb, ancient cypress trees reach the sky. To the left of the tomb is a memorial pagoda, with the "Record of the Public Funeral of Mr. Tian" written by Xia Douyin engraved on the front and back of the pagoda. At 3:30 PM, the public funeral ceremony was held. After the coffin was carried into the tomb, cannons were fired and music was played. Xia Douyin presided over the ceremony, presenting flowers and reciting the eulogy for the public funeral, lasting half an hour. The ceremony concluded and the attendees dispersed.

The other night, the abbess, Fu Ming, was fast asleep when four bandits speaking with a Jiangbei accent suddenly broke in through the window, grabbed a suitcase, and fled. The main hall of the nunnery has been damaged, and donations of over one hundred yuan were raised in Shanghai to repair it. After being robbed, the nun was very upset and reported the incident to the Fourth Police Station for investigation the next day, and also reported it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Hunan Refugees Harass Everywhere</p>
<p>In recent days, refugees have repeatedly passed through this county, harassing the towns and villages, causing unease among the people. A few days ago, over two hundred Hunan refugees suddenly arrived in Baimao, the 14th district, and robbed Zhou Buqing's house, causing considerable losses. The leaders of the refugees, Shen and Tao, and five others, were extremely tyrannical. When their demand for rations was not met, they ordered the refugees to carry out the robbery. The day before yesterday, the refugees traveled in six boats from Wutangmen to the areas bordering Wuxi and Changzhou, such as Xueyanqiao Town, Hubu Jiangkou, and Hubu Village, demanding the distribution of rations. Wu Zongjie, the head of the Xueyanqiao Defense Corps, came forward to negotiate. As a result, due to local difficulties, no funds could be allocated. Wu personally gave the refugees two thousand copper coins. The next day, they sailed to Xiaochengwan in Changzhou and landed, blocking the road and robbing people. They also broke into the house of villager Xue Tian to rob, and finally went to Zhou Shungen's house in Dongchengwan and Liaoe Township in Xichengwan to rob, causing losses of five or six hundred yuan. Then they boarded the boats one after another and headed towards Zhou Tieqiao in Yixing.</p>

<p>Special Education News</p>
<h3>Preliminary Ideas on Reforming Chinese School Education (II)</h3>
<p>Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>Second, backward production and economic exhaustion are China's biggest crises. Now, the needs of Chinese people for food, clothing, housing, and transportation all depend on imported goods. Not to mention the larger transportation tools, such as ships, trains, and airplanes, which must be bought from foreign countries. Even smaller industrial products, such as clocks, fountain pens, even staples for staplers, paper clips, door locks, and sewing needles, all come from abroad. This is not surprising. The most strange thing is that China was the first country to invent silk and silk fabrics, but now imported silks and satins flood the market. China has been an agricultural country for thousands of years, but now imported pine wood must be used to build houses, and foreign dishes are indispensable for banquets. Even the people's food must be imported from foreign countries. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the import amount of rice and wheat exceeded the export amount by more than 200 million yuan. This is such a shameful situation, such a dangerous phenomenon. If things continue like this, others do not need to send a soldier or fire a cannon, and we will inevitably head towards destruction. What is especially dangerous is that past education not only cannot increase the people's productive capacity, but also reduces the people's productive capacity. Originally, a farmer's son, if he is not educated, can still become a hardworking farmer when he grows up. Once educated, he will never be willing to go to the fields to cultivate. Originally, a worker's son, if he is not educated, can still become a hardworking worker when he grows up. Once educated, he will never be willing to work with his hands. This phenomenon is everywhere. Therefore, most of the students who graduate from universities, middle schools, and even elementary schools become unproductive elements who sit and eat. Everyone is squeezing into the political and educational circles. Those who cannot squeeze in become unemployed. Therefore, the number of school graduates increases year by year, and the number of unemployed people also increases year by year. The unstable state of society is also worse year by year. This kind of education will inevitably lead to the destruction of the country. We must now use the power of education to reverse this declining trend and use the power of education to increase the productive capacity of the people. Those who were originally capable of producing will have even stronger productive capacity after receiving education. Those who were originally incapable of producing will also become productive elements after receiving education. This is China's second major need at present and also the second goal of education.</p>
<p>Third, only good teachers can provide good education. In the past, China had two major shortcomings in terms of teachers: one was poor quality, and the other was insufficient quantity. How can we say poor quality? Among the primary and secondary school teachers now, there are certainly some who take education as a lifelong career and work diligently for the happiness of children. But to be frank, most of them really do not understand the needs of the country and do not understand the goals of education. They are there trying to get by, simply fulfilling their duties. As long as they can teach on time and not waste the students' time, they are considered to have fulfilled their responsibilities. Because of the poor quality of the teachers, the students who are produced are superficial in terms of knowledge, digesting without transforming. In terms of skills, they are completely unskilled and unable to produce. As a result, they all become vagrants in society. How can we say insufficient quantity? Now, it is true that you can often meet unemployed normal school graduates and university education department graduates in cities. But in rural primary schools, it is as difficult as climbing to the sky to find a normal school graduate. If we really want to universalize national education, then the existing normal school graduates will not be enough to distribute. Therefore, we must use the power of education to create many good teachers. These teachers must not only have abundant knowledge and be able to teach, but also have the ability to produce, enthusiastic emotions, and noble personalities. They can be a model for children in their entire lives. Only with such teachers can we create healthy citizens and can we shoulder the responsibility of saving the country. This is China's third major need at present and also the third goal of education.</p>
<p>Fourth, China is now characterized by overstaffing everywhere, exposing the major problem of unemployment. On the other hand, however, there is a great feeling of a lack of talent. This is the case in both academic and professional fields. China has been sending students to study abroad for decades, and tens of thousands of returned students have come back. But how many of them have been able to make contributions and establish themselves in the academic world? How many have their own specialized works? How many have systematically introduced the famous works of foreign scholars to China? There are truly very few. This shows the lack of academic talent. China now has to hire foreign experts as consultants to build railroads, train troops, develop water conservancy, improve agriculture, and modernize cities. Everywhere there is a lack of professional talent. If China wants to develop all industries, including agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, forestry, water conservancy, transportation, and municipal administration, it must quickly cultivate professional talent. If it wants to promote academic culture and enhance national status, it must quickly cultivate academic talent. Cultivating talent still depends on the power of education. This is China's fourth major need at present and also the fourth goal of education.</p>
<p>Fifth, if we have a majority of healthy citizens and also a minority of specialized talents, what is the country lacking or not lacking? It is still lacking political leaders. Now, all of China's agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, forestry, waterways, transportation, municipal administration, and other industries are closely related to politics. If the government is not clean and the political system is not on track, all industries cannot be protected by the power of politics, but will be destroyed by the power of politics. Then, no matter how many specialized talents there are, they can only sigh in vain, and no industry can develop. Moreover, now that the Red Bandits are rampant, the people cannot live and work in peace, and society exhibits an extremely unstable state. How can we fundamentally eliminate the Red Bandits and stabilize society? This can definitely not be achieved solely by military force, but relies on enlightened politics. But how can we have enlightened politics? The prerequisite is to first have good political leaders. Political leaders can also be called specialized political talents. Why do I want to list them separately? This is because the nature of political talent is very different from that of other specialized talents. Compared with other specialized talents, what the country requires of them is their specialized skills or knowledge. What they contribute to the country is also their specialized skills or knowledge. A railroad engineer, the country only hopes that he can build good railroads. A construction engineer, the country only hopes that he can build solid and reliable houses. A chemist, the country only hopes that he can conduct in-depth research on chemistry and make valuable contributions. As for other aspects outside of their profession, whether their other wisdom is abundant, whether their thinking is sharp, whether their behavior is completely flawless, this is what we should not demand. But it is not the same for political leaders. What the country requires of political leaders is not their specialized knowledge or skills, but their ability to lead society, shift customs, appoint the worthy, and promote various undertakings. For example, the chairman of a province or the magistrate of a county should be political leaders. The chairman or magistrate may not understand engineering, but they should employ good engineering experts to do a good job in the engineering profession in a province or county. The chairman or magistrate may not understand education, but they should employ educational experts to make education developed in a province or county. Chinese society is full of phenomena of decline, slackness, disorder, and corruption. Those who are political leaders should set an example, shift the customs, replace decline with vigor, replace slackness with tension, replace disorder with order, and replace corruption with integrity. China is a society where "what those above like, those below will like even more." Therefore, the work of reforming bad social customs can only be done by those who bear political responsibility, in order to achieve rapid results, and this cannot be achieved by other specialized talents. There is another level that can prove the difference between political leaders and specialized talents. Specialized talents are almost the same regardless of the country. Being a great engineer in the United States is also a great engineer in Japan, and still a great engineer in Soviet Russia. Being a great chemist in England is also a great chemist in Germany, and still a great chemist in China. But political leaders must come from their own country. Therefore, American politicians cannot improve Japanese politics, and Soviet politicians cannot lead the people of England. Therefore, when there is a lack of specialized talent, it can be obtained from other places, but political leaders cannot. China can hire Americans to be engineers to dredge the Huai River, and can hire Germans to be advisors to train the army. But if a certain province lacks a good chairman, or a certain county lacks a good magistrate, it will never be possible to hire foreigners to serve in these positions. China lacks specialized talent, but it especially lacks political leaders. This kind of political leader can only be created by the power of education. This is China's fifth major need at present and also the fifth goal of education.</p>

<h3>Supporting the Novel: Silver Threads of the Rotary Club (21)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(11)</p>
<p>The meeting place was crammed with people, and there was a bit of chaos, all wondering why Commander Yuan was so late. "Just being a commander and he's already putting on airs, what would he be like if he became a division commander or a corps commander!"</p>
<p>"Maybe something important happened; there have been a lot of rumors outside these past few days."</p>
<p>"Zhu Bofang is too muddle-headed. He should have sent a car to pick him up in person a long time ago; if you don't pick him up, the commander will naturally be angry and not come."</p>
<p>"Maybe the division commander and corps commander are jealous, envious of his memorial tablet, and the commander doesn't dare to come to the meeting."</p>
<p>"That's not it. Just now the county magistrate, the police chief, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, Miss Zhu, and others went to welcome him like a carload of ghosts and came back disappointed, didn't they? Didn't they just announce that the commander had already gone out alone and would probably arrive soon? I think if he's still not here, it might be an ill omen, and he was murdered by a traitor on the road."</p>
<p>While many people were unconsciously speculating and discussing, everyone on the stage was also discussing and decided to start the meeting immediately without further delay, because it was already late. First, there would be speeches from all sides, and the unveiling ceremony would be moved to the last item on the program.</p>
<p>The school bell in the primary school was as small as the one shaken by the cake and bread sellers in Shanghai, and even smaller than the bell on the kerosene carts in the interior. Zhu Bofang, as fat as a water buffalo, held the small bell and shook it vigorously to announce the start of the meeting, but the meeting place was still not quiet. The sound of the bell was like the sound of golden bell insects in autumn.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was an uproar from below the stage, and everyone on the stage was baffled.</p>
<p>"Quiet! Everyone quiet! The meeting has started! The meeting has started!" Zhu Bofang shouted frantically, but it was ineffective. The crowd was not paying attention to the stage, but turned around to look back.</p>
<p>Zhu Qilan had sharp eyes. She saw Commander Yuan walking slowly in the distance first, and shouted, "Ah! He's here! He's here!" She was so happy as if she had found a treasure, gesticulating wildly to show that her heart was blooming.</p>
<p>Then the county magistrate, the police chief, and others heard Zhu Qilan's shout and also noticed him. So Zhu Bofang directed the military band to play music, and followed the county magistrate off the stage to greet him.</p>
<p>"A truly populist commander; he neither rides a horse nor takes a car, and doesn't even have an aide-de-camp. He walked from the city. He's truly a"</p>
<p>good commander!" The crowd was especially faithful and admiring, but no one knew that he had come from a secret rendezvous with his lover in this town.</p>
<p>Zhu Qilan was obsessed with Europeanization and embraced the custom of Lady First, first going up to shake hands with the commander, and holding his hand tightly for a full two minutes; but the county magistrate was very unhappy, because he was the county magistrate and should have been the first to go up and shake hands, but Zhu Qilan had rushed up and shaken hands first.</p>
<p>The police chief, of course, wanted to flatter the county magistrate, so he squeezed Zhu Qilan from behind, and she couldn't stand and had to let go and stand aside. Then the county magistrate, the police chief, and others stepped forward, stood at attention, bowed, and shook hands in turn.</p>

<p>Finance: Gold Speculation Reverses and Falls</p>
<p>The Wednesday Afternoon Closing Problem Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>Falls Back 5 Taels 7 Mace: Yesterday, the 21st, the gold speculation market reversed after several days of continuous rise, and the downward trend resumed. The situation was still calm, but the market was still uneasy. There were differences of more than 4 taels in half a day, and finally fell back more than 5 taels. The opening was weak, and the silver market fell slightly. Although the forward market also recovered slightly, it was not moved. The continued rise in U.S. silver and the downward psychology of the industry led to a weakening of the foreign exchange rate. However, the advances and retreats were sudden, fluctuating around 730 taels twice. In the end, it was still within the range. Most firms sold more than they bought. All the short positions in October that had not been cleared were cleared by Yuanxingyong, the long position, to more than 200 short positions yesterday, at a price of 8 taels. Because of Wednesday, the problem of permanent closure of the market on Wednesday afternoon, which was previously requested by various brokers and agents, has not been resolved. However, the exchange stated that the time was specified in the business rules and could not be changed for a while, so it was not approved. However, whether the brokers have expressed a unanimous opinion has not been resolved yet. However, the agents insisted on the original proposal and were unwilling to buy or sell, so the market did not open. However, the firms still arrived at the exchange as usual, and the exchange opened as usual. The agents were quite calm and dispersed after 4 o'clock. The details of the morning market are recorded below:</p>
<p>Weakness Seen at the Opening: From the opening of the November market at 731 taels and a half in the morning, it fell 2 taels and 9 mace. Large positions fell by one-sixteenth to one-eighth. U.S. silver public and private telegrams also fell by a small one-eighth. However, the European market went from soft to firm because there were few sellers, so people's hearts were downward. Next was 31 taels and 1 mace. However, Hengyu, Hong Kangyong, Zhifengyong, and others bought in. Also, Huabi sold to Bombay December English gold at 190625, and bought December U.S. silver at 625, so it was 32 taels and 2 mace. Then there was a fluctuation of 1 tael and 2 mace. Goods came for sale, and Yongfeng bought in. At 9:15, more sellers came, and Zhongfu sold November U.S. silver at 5625, and HSBC sold September at 375, which immediately dropped more than 1 tael to 30 taels and 4 mace. At that time, Yifengyong, Daxingyong, Hengchangyong, Yuantai, Shenkang, and others bought in, and it immediately recovered 1 tael, 5 mace, and 6 candareens. At 9:30, it was 32 taels.

In addition, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang, Fuchang, Yuanmaoyong, Yifengyong, Hengyu, Xiexingyong, Dadecheng, Futaiheng, Yuantai, and others tended to sell. Up to January, English gold was traded at 1925, and Citibank sold September U.S. silver at 375, so the gold price dropped by 2 taels. After 10:30, it was even weaker and finally broke 30 taels. Also, in January, U.S. silver was calculated at 875, and the market was weak. Until 10:45, it was 28 taels and 7 mace. Then, some small investors bought in, and it recovered 1 tael.

Soon after, Huabi, Pangen, and others absorbed January U.S. silver at 0875, Maihang absorbed English gold at 25, and Dadecheng, Hongxing, Yuantai, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, Yifeng, and others all dragged in, causing the price to rise by 2 taels. At 11:20, it was 30 taels and 7 mace. Unexpectedly, people's hearts were not firm, and sellers were still endless, such as Yuanmaoyong, Yuanheng, Hong Kangyong, Futaiheng, Hengyu, Yifengyong, and others competing to sell in succession, and the price plunged more than 2 taels. With only a few cents up and down, at 11:45, it was finally 27 taels and 9 mace. In an instant, it added 1 tael, and goods came in for hedging. At 11:50, it was 29 taels. Then it depreciated by 5 or 6 candareens to 28 taels and 4 mace, and then increased to 8 taels and 9 mace, but there was not much trading. At noon, the market was at 28 taels and 7 mace, and then continued to be 29 taels, 3 mace, and 4 candareens. It was generally small short positions, so they were eager to close the market to prevent no trading in the afternoon. Compared with the day before yesterday, it fell again by 5 taels and 7 mace (according to the quotation), which was a reversal of the continuous rise of more than 20 taels (plus the hedging) since the market opened on the 16th. According to yesterday's half-day, the maximum price was 32 taels and 2 mace, and the minimum price was 27 taels and 9 mace, a difference of 4 taels and 3 mace. The bare metal market added 15 taels.</p>
<p>Premium Exceeded 5 Taels: The premium was still unchanged in U.S. silver, so it was still 800 taels, a premium of 70 taels to 68 taels, then 72 taels. The result was 71 taels, a premium of 5 taels more than the previous day. The accounts were 39 taels in September, 29 taels in November, and 35 taels in water.</p>
<p>Supply Exceeded Demand in the Market: In terms of table transactions, the supply generally exceeded the demand. According to statistics, Bingxing, Yongfeng, Shunli, Wanxing, Hengchangyong, Hengxing, Fuxingyong, and Daxingyong all bought in. Yifengyong and Qianchangxiang bought in more than they sold. Hengyu, Fuyu, Yuanmaoyong, Zhaofengchang, Hong Kangyong, Futaiheng, Yuanheng, Yuhe, Yuandayong, and Xiexingyong all sold out. Yuanxingyong sold out more than it bought in. Yuanchun, Yuantai, Shenchangyong, Fuchang, Dadecheng, and others sold and bought in alternately, and the number was not small. On that day, the Dalian gang bought in more than 300 positions and sold out more than 100 positions. The Guangdong gang (Hengxing) bought in less than 100 positions. According to the investigation, the amount of each firm was more than the previous day, with a total of about 20,000, it is said.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Rate Seems to Be Loosening</p>
<p>Although the silver market shrank yesterday, the exchange rate also fell. However, the Shanghai market was not moved. It was actually a small number. As for HSBC's quotation, such as English, American, Hong Kong, and Singapore, there was no change. However, India and Germany each reduced by 25, the franc went down by 1 yuan, and the Netherlands reduced by half a shield. The internal market seemed to be trending loose. The morning market was wide, then slightly flat, and then reversed and loosened. As a result, compared with the day before yesterday, English gold increased by 125, and English gold only increased by 1875, which was due to the continued decline in the exchange rate. As for the gold market, it reversed and fell, returning to within the 730 tael mark. The transaction of Huashang remittance bills was not as smooth as the day before yesterday, and it was only half a day on Wednesday morning. A total of 100,000 pounds of English gold were traded, mostly interbank transactions. Maihang purchased, and Bombay and Sassoon foreign firms also purchased the November contract. However, the gold firms rarely deposited or withdrew. About 400,000 to 500,000 yuan of U.S. silver was traded in total. Chengyongfeng and other firms sold out some, and there were few settlements.

<p>Interest Rate Followed the Old Rules</p>
<p>Recently, the financial market situation, due to the cautious lending relationship of silver and money industries, all sectors of the commercial category feel the difficulty of uneven happiness and suffering, resulting in those who control the power of silver and money being full of warehouses, while the circulation in the market is extremely difficult. The most difficult are the accounts of 35,000 or 10,000, which have long relied on money houses for adjustment, but now they cannot be accommodated, resulting in financial stagnation and commercial decline. Therefore, there is no major demand for the interest rate in the general market.</p>
<p>Interest Rates Generally Stable: The "foreign interest rate" in the early market was 6 mace, 9 fen, and 5 li, and in the afternoon market it was 6 mace, 9 fen, 4 li, 8 hao, and 7 hu and a half. As a result, it seemed to be 2 hao and a half better than the afternoon market the day before yesterday, but 2 hao and a half smaller than the early market the day before yesterday.

The price of small Guangdong silver coins in the early market was 5 mace and 8 fen and 8 li, the same price as the day before yesterday. The afternoon market fell slightly by 1 li to 5 mace, 8 fen, and 7 li. The transaction volume was 130,000 jiao in the early market and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon market. After the sudden shrinkage of copper coins, the price has been increasing every day. Yesterday, it increased by another 2,500 yuan to 429,500 yuan. The transaction volume was more than 45,500 strings of coins.</p>

Huashang receipts were more than 2 million, foreign firms receipts were more than 2.1 million, telegraphic transfer funds were more than 400,000, Bund pledge funds were 1 million, various goods exchange tax funds receipts were more than 7.9 million, pledge transactions were more than 900,000, warehouse withdrawals were 1.3 million, money house silver public receipts were more than 31.1 million, additional funds receipts were more than 4.3 million, various remittance funds receipts were more than 600,000, and cash receipts were more than 1 million.

<p>Securities: Bond Market Suddenly Turns Better</p>
<p>Slightly Stronger Demand with Prices Rising by About Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Transactions Also Reach More Than 3.7 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday (21st), the Huashang Securities Exchange's various bond markets, the spot market was still sluggish, with only 7,000 yuan traded throughout the day. The futures market buying and selling suddenly became active, and prices tended to rise. The total transaction volume for the day was 3.76 million yuan. Hedging and adding positions were quite active, and small investors also occasionally bought in, so the market was better. As a result, only customs duty and reorganization were good for a few jiao, and the others each rose by 4, 5, or 6 jiao. The spot price of the reorganized six alone was 9 jiao higher than last week. The sudden rise in bond prices was probably due to the recent excellent results in suppressing bandits, and the Shandong situation was expected to be resolved peacefully, which improved the market sentiment. However, it is still not permissible to be too optimistic for the time being, it is said.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Merchants Tend to Sell Short</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is very weak. Because people's hearts are deteriorating, and most tend to sell short, the long positions are unanimously bearish under pressure. The Rongxing long position is still struggling hard and has not yet emerged, but it is rumored in the market that 3,000 bales have been transferred to another firm, so the selling force is very strong. In the market, the actual demand from the customer side continues uninterrupted, so the spot yarn market is still calm, it is said.</p>
<p>Manpower Standard Yarn Fluctuates Little: In the morning market of manpower standard yarn, although U.S. cotton rose slightly, the market sentiment was still scattered. In addition, the voice of selling short was extremely high, and the market was even weaker. As a result, the near month fell by 5 fen and the far month rose by 1 qian. In the afternoon, the market sentiment was still uneven, with each month rising or falling by 1 or 2 qian. According to statistics, 24,900 bales were traded throughout the day, and Wenlong sold 1,000 bales, Lichang 1,900 bales, Dachangcheng 1,000 bales, and Dachang 550 bales. Yukang bought 950 bales, Rongxing 850 bales, and Gengfeng 1,750 bales. The closing price is listed below:</p>

<p>Guangdong 255 Anqing 20 Hankou 25 Yunnan 80 Shantou 110</p>
<p>Cotton Slightly Uneven</p>
<p>Speculative Holding Embraces the Principle of Rising Sales and Short Selling</p>
<p>The cotton market is uneven. A certain factory sells continuously, so even though foreign cotton rose slightly, it is difficult to arouse people's hearts. Most people think that after the spot cotton floods into Shanghai, there may be a very big drop, so most embrace the idea of selling short when the price rises. However, the overseas cotton yarn situation is gradually improving, but the local market is still in a bad and sluggish state, it is said.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Near Month Falls, Far Month Improves: In the morning market of Zheng Standard, the market sentiment was slightly better due to the slight rise in U.S. cotton, and each month rose by 5 fen to 1 qian. In the afternoon, the near month fell by 2 qian again, and the far month improved slightly by 5 fen. According to statistics, 65,400 bales were traded throughout the day.

<p>Estimation of Cotton Production in Taicang, Shanxi, Jin and Lu</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Japanese cotton industry at the end of August on the cotton production in the three provinces of Taicang, Shanxi, and Jin, the situation of cotton cultivation in Zhengzhou this year is that the rainfall is insufficient, and the sowing is delayed by two weeks. The weather was still good when the buds emerged, but it was very dry after June. Until mid-July, there was no rain for about 40 days, and the development was greatly hindered. The cotton trees were about to wither, but fortunately, heavy rain fell in mid-July, and it began to recover. The degree of recovery varied from place to place depending on the amount of rainfall.</p>
<p>Henan: There was more rainfall in Lingbao and Shanxi, about 70% of the harvest, and the flowering and fruiting were good. The temperature is high, and if there is suitable rainfall, a good harvest can be expected. There was slightly less rainfall in Luoyang, about 60% of the harvest. Yanshi and Heyin can get 70%. However, the suburbs of Zhengzhou were damaged by hail, and only 25% of the harvest was obtained. However, on average, 64% can be obtained, Meng County and Gong County 70%, and Xiaoji on the north bank of the Yellow River was most benefited by the rainfall, and 80% can be obtained. On average, there is a 74% harvest. The cotton field area increased by 4% in Lingbao and Shanxi. Luoyang, Yanshi, Zhengzhou, Xiaoji and other places increased sharply last year, and there was no increase or decrease this year.</p>
<p>Shanxi: The drought in the production area north of the Wei River is particularly evident. Although there was slight rain in mid-July, the trunks were still short, with only 20% of the harvest. The rainfall in Xianyang, Xi'an, Weinan, Xinzhu, Chishui, Huazhou and other places south of the Wei River was slightly more, and 50% of the harvest can be obtained. In addition, in Chaoyi and Tongzhou and other areas along the Yellow River, there was heavy rain in August, and the dikes collapsed, submerging many areas, with only 10% of the harvest. Due to the ban on opium cultivation, cotton planting can be increased by 10%.</p>
<p>Shanxi: Most of the production areas in Hongtong, Jiangzhou, and Linfen were flooded and damaged, with about 35% of the harvest. The plains in the central part of the Yellow River, Hanyang, and other places suffered a lot of water damage, with about 20% of the harvest. The drought in Chang County, Anba, and Jie County was particularly severe in June and July. Although it rained in August, it was not easy to recover, and 40% of the harvest is expected.</p>
<p>The average estimate of good cotton producing areas in Shanxi and Shanxi is only 37% of the harvest. The average harvest of the entire producing area in Henan, Shanxi, and Shanxi is 53%. According to people there, it can be called a normal year's harvest. The cotton field area decreased last year due to insufficient food. This year, it was reduced again due to cheap food and cotton. The average cotton field area in the three provinces increased by 2% compared with last year. The decrease in Shanxi was offset by the increase in other provinces, resulting in no increase or decrease. The estimated cotton production is as follows (unit: 1,000 dan):</p>
<p>Location This Year's Estimate 20th Year 19th Year</p>
<p>Lingbao 219.4 131.3 115.2</p>
<p>Luoyang 40.5 52.3 3.2</p>
<p>Shanxi 79.0 59.6 50.8</p>
<p>Shanxi 170.5 255.4 183.7</p>
<p>Taikang 42.0 42.0 42.0</p>
<p>Total 551.0 638.6 322.9</p>
<p>Shandong Province: According to a survey by the Qingdao Japanese Cotton Traders Association, the estimated cotton production in Shandong Province this year was released on August 20. The cotton planting area increased by about 10% compared with last year. There was a heavy rain in mid-July, and then there was more rain in the interior, and the cotton bolls fell off. Recently, the weather has cleared up, and it has improved slightly, so the overall harvest is similar to last year, it is said.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education</h3>
<p>Secret Investigation of Education in Various Counties by Assigned Personnel</p>
<p>Dismissal of Xu Decheng, Director of Wujin Agricultural Education Center</p>
<p>Reprimand of Jiang Zhenyun, Director of Danyang Agricultural Education Center</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education is actively reorganizing local education in various counties and has successively promulgated various regulations to be followed. This semester, special emphasis is placed on inspections to assess the performance of various institutions. In addition to dispatching provincial supervisors for guidance, personnel are also sent to various counties for secret investigations to ensure that all institutions are vigilant and actively working. It is learned that personnel were recently sent to Wujin and Danyang counties for secret investigations of social education institutions. According to reports, Su Hongquan, Director of the Wujin County Public Education Center, is able to plan the center's affairs meticulously. However, regarding livelihood education, it should be actively promoted in accordance with the center's plan, and the number of public schools should also be increased appropriately to promote it. Xu Decheng, Director of the County Agricultural Education Center, is ineffective in managing affairs and has no way to improve, and should be dismissed as a warning. The Danyang County Agricultural Education Center has simple equipment, most of the registers are not filled in, there is no plan for various undertakings, and staff members cannot arrive at the center on time. Considering that the director, Jiang Zhenyun, has not been at the center for long, he should be reprimanded first to observe his future performance. The above matters have been instructed to the counties separately for compliance.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Quotations from the 93-Year-Old Ma Xiangbo</p>
<h3>Answers to Questions from a Reporter from the Osaka "Mainichi Shimbun"</h3>
<p>Sawamura Yukio, the Shanghai branch manager of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, along with translator Ryuoka Noboru and a photographer, visited the elderly Xiangbo. Prior to the visit, they sent a letter stating that they were compiling a world celebrity directory and requested a meeting. Later, the interview was published in the second collection of "Impressions of Shanghai Figures." Excerpts from the meeting and conversation are as follows.</p>
<p>Japanese reporter asked: What are your thoughts and feelings about Japan? Old Man Xiangbo replied: Decades ago, many Chinese students studying in Japan were encouraged to go there by me. They wanted to go to Europe and America; I said it was more important for Chinese people to study Japan's national conditions. According to my personal observations, the characteristics of the Japanese national character are diligence, frugality, and obedience. I remember that during the Meiji Restoration, there were shogunate officials who committed suicide by drowning themselves in order to be loyal to the emperor and love their country: this is Shinobazu Pond under the Tokyo Mountains, you must have visited and paid your respects! The Japanese reporter then asked: What is the core of your thoughts?</p>
<p>Old Man Xiangbo replied: I have no unique theory. I regard the teachings of the Catholic faith as the core of my thoughts. The Catholic Church is selfless and impartial; therefore, I recognize the international situation and maintain this fair attitude. In front of me, I will not belittle you because of being foreigners; unlike the white people who belittle us yellow people in general.</p>
<p>The Japanese reporters presented "Modern Japan," finely printed in English, and a decorated dancing fan as gifts; during the conversation, they bowed as well, without losing the demeanor of gentlemen: therefore, the elderly Xiangbo treated them favorably, and before parting, agreed to be photographed and gave the inscription "Light for Japan, Education is the Foundation of the Country." Later, they took their leave. Old Man Xiangbo said: The fan is an old-fashioned Oriental thing, the decorations are a sign of respect, but seeing the semi-naked dancers in the book "Modern Japan," I can't help but lament that it has been infected with Western bad habits!</p>
<h3>Nine-One-Eight Address of the God of Love</h3>
<p>— Ah Hong</p>
<p>Young men and women, listen!</p>
<p>My beloved children: I come to protect you with boundless affection, deep love, and supreme peace! In my domain, there is only sweetness! Only joy! Only warmth! Although poetry divides the seasons, here there is only spring! In this atmosphere, there is no anger! Nor is there resentment! You each live your own lives, and I also obtain unparalleled joy!</p>
<p>However, last year, on September 18, from some corner, a group of rebels against human love emerged: they occupied the Hinggan Mountains, ate people like beasts, and were extremely ugly! The trampling reached thousands of miles! The disturbances lasted for years, and the cruelty intensified! This race of snakes, where is there any humanity? To take their souls is the power of the god of death: but to expel these ugly things from our domain, I can still lead you!</p>
<p>Come! Come! My beloved children! Let us not talk about love and romance! Nor should we recite wind and moon! Quickly arm yourselves and go! Go to the streets of the Hinggan Mountains! Fight for: defending peace:</p>
<p>Defending the domain of love! This is truly great! But, remember: my children! Don't touch my arrows by mistake!</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Wang Chonghui</h3>
<p>— Zai Jun</p>
<p>Before retiring to The Hague due to his aversion to state affairs, former Chief Justice Wang Chonghui's life stories are little known. I will now record them to tell the readers.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was from Guangdong, and was the first Chinese student to receive a doctorate in France, earning him the reputation of "Old Doctor." He lived in Europe and America for decades, but had absolutely no Western habits, and even hated those who had adopted Western habits. If someone wore leather shoes and a Western suit to see him, Mr. Wang would definitely express his dissatisfaction. In China, Mr. Wang had never been seen wearing foreign clothes.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was diligent in his studies and would not sleep until after 2 a.m. every night. He was not good at grooming himself, and even if his clothes were torn and dirty, he would not change them unless urged to do so. Mr. Wang often disliked the waste of time at banquets, so if someone invited Mr. Wang, he would gorge himself immediately upon arrival, never stopping his chopsticks, and leave as soon as he was full, never lingering.</p>
<p>Once, Mr. Wang was traveling to Shanghai by train. He was accidentally negligent, and all the cups and kettles on the table fell to the ground and shattered. The attendant asked him for compensation, but Mr. Wang was embarrassed and did not answer. The attendant pressed him even harder, so he repeatedly cried out that he had no money, and was at a loss as to what to do, because Mr. Wang never carried a single penny with him when he went out. Only when his followers arrived was his predicament resolved.</p>
<h3>After Visiting Pang Xunqin's Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Hong Mo</p>
<p>Pang Xunqin's solo art exhibition opened on the 15th, and the reporter happily went to see it on the morning of the 16th. Because it was still early, there were not many visitors, so I was able to read and observe at my leisure.</p>
<p>The impression that this art exhibition gave me was indeed much better than the impressions I have had from recent past art exhibitions. Crude production, falsehood, superficiality, and plagiarism, these shortcomings are naturally nowhere to be found in Mr. Pang's paintings.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I saw Mr. Pang's paintings was at the Nanjing Municipal Government Art Exhibition last year, and the painting exhibited at that exhibition was "Spanish Dance," which is No. 43 in this exhibition. In this painting, in addition to the Spanish Mantilla, the bold and powerful woman, the enchanting dance posture, and the seductive eyes, the lively brushstrokes and strong colors also fully express the unique temperament of the Gypsy woman. At that time, I regretted not being able to read more of Mr. Pang's paintings. I am very pleased that this time I was able to satisfy my request of the past year.</p>
<p>Of course, structure is a very important condition for the success of a painting. Mr. Pang is quite confident in this regard. He uses a pattern-style composition to arrange his paintings, and often the position he stands in relation to the object is a place that general painters do not pay attention to. Therefore, his composition is particularly novel and interesting, and this point is especially easy to see in his several nude paintings.</p>
<p>In recent years, the art world seems to pay less and less attention to technique. | Of course, this refers to the basics. | Probably influenced by new European painting theories. However, all emerging knowledge, when moved to China, easily loses its true face, and the same is true in the performance of paintings. Many people who hold brushes, | I am embarrassed to call them painters | cover | or not fully cover | the canvas with pigments, self-deceptively hanging it publicly in exhibitions. If someone points and asks about it, they will say, "This is the deformation of the object, the expression of the self, and the creation of genius." Outsiders can only say yes. I remember once at an exhibition, a painter said to me, "Now, paintings are not just deformed, they are simply disintegrated." This painter was one I usually admired, and this criticism especially made me convinced. Now is the time when the art world is disintegrating, and Mr. Pang is using his realistically deformed paintings to support this precarious situation. No matter what object he depicts, the first step is deformation, and the second step is reconstruction. After these two layers of training, he completes his rigorous and realistic paintings, which is his greatest strength. So I say that he supports the current precarious situation of disintegration, perhaps not an overstatement?</p>
<p>A few years ago, someone said, "China only has lyrical sketches, but no great works of thought." This statement seems not yet old, because"</p>
<p>In recent years, the art world has indeed not produced great creations that express thought, and even the person who said this has not published any, which is truly a strange thing! Mr. Pang's exhibition cannot avoid this common problem, and I, who am very concerned about Mr. Pang, have some regrets, but this seems to be an overly critical remark.</p>
<p>Crane Annotation: I have also visited Mr. Pang's art exhibition and greatly admire his ability to use the lines of Chinese painting in oil paintings. His self-portrait and a portrait of a beauty in ancient costume are even more rich in the style of Qiu Shizhou. As for the rest, Mr. Hong Mo has already spoken before me, so I won't say much more.</p>
<h3>Gifts and Donations</h3>
<p>— Zhu Chuo</p>
<p>| A Proportion |</p>
<p>"Mid-Autumn Mooncakes" "Mid-Autumn Festival Gifts, XX are the most suitable" large advertisements with tempting colors, are prominently published in the newspaper. People carrying piles of paper bags, like a tide, were crowding and pushing each other in the brilliant evening lights, on the sidewalks of the Three Companies and the road. | In this group's Mid-Autumn Festival side, everywhere is indispensable to purchase holiday gifts and give holiday gifts of people, to embellish a bit. The September 18th anniversary, was only with the 59, May 30th generally, became the nouns on the calendar; the Northeast of rivers and mountains, early like "nine cattle one hair", has long been insignificant. But the news of the brave troops fighting hard outside the Pass can still be watched with interest, like watching "Shanghai ruffians gathering and robbing young girls" and "literary figures and philosophers fighting love lawsuits," and when they see news such as "major attack on Shenyang," they will also give a few admiring cheers, like watching a full-scale martial arts show. | However, how many people are willing to donate money to these brave troops with insufficient weapons and lack of food! Yes. There is Zhang Xueliang's assistance in the brave troops? There is Soviet Russia's support outside? China cannot be saved by me alone, let's eat mooncakes and watch the full-scale martial arts news in the newspaper. | Therefore, the purchase of holiday gifts is as crowded as a tide, and the donation to the Northeast is as rare as the morning stars! This is the phenomenon in September of the 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Director of the Hydrographic Bureau</h3>
<p>Wu Guangzong Assassinated Yesterday</p>
<p>Shot Four Times in the Morning</p>
<p>Succumbed to Injuries at Noon</p>
<p>Four Assailants Escaped</p>
<p>Wu Guangzong, Director of the Hydrographic Bureau of the Navy, was attacked yesterday at 9:15 AM at his residence, No. 16, Lane 2, Ningkangli, Fangxie Road, Ximen, Nanshi. Four assassins broke into his inner room and opened fire on Wu, hitting him with four bullets. The assassins fled the scene immediately. Wu was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but due to his advanced age, excessive blood loss, and the fact that all four bullets hit vital organs, he succumbed to his injuries at the hospital at 11:25 AM. Upon hearing the news, the Navy Department and the Municipal Government dispatched personnel to Wu's residence to express condolences. Wen Hong-en, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, personally conducted an on-site investigation. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Intrusion by Thugs   Although Mr. Wu was over sixty years old, he was energetic and diligent in his work. Except for weekly holidays, he always went to his office at Fenglin Bridge at 9:00 AM every morning, rain or shine. Yesterday morning, he got up unusually early, leaving his bed at 7:00 AM. While he was using the toilet, four thugs suddenly broke into Wu's residence from the back. Three were wearing gray long gowns and one was wearing a black robe. Three were wearing felt hats and one was wearing a straw hat. Upon entering, Wu's attendant, Xu Hua (a soldier from the First Company of the Navy Guard serving as Wu's bodyguard), immediately stepped forward to greet them and inquire about their business. One of them, speaking with a Zhejiang Shengxian accent, asked Xu, "Is your master Wu at home?" Xu, seeing that the visitors' attire was unusual and their behavior suspicious, quickly replied, "The master has already gone to the office."</p>
<p>Shooting in the Building   The thugs then continued to say to Xu, "We have come specifically today to borrow some travel expenses from Master Wu." As they said this, Xu was about to reply when the four of them drew their pistols simultaneously. One person was left to monitor Xu Hua, while the remaining three, armed with pistols, rushed upstairs together. First, they drove Wu's concubine, Zhang, and the female servants and children downstairs, locking them and Xu Hua in the east wing of the reception room. The three then proceeded upstairs to search for Wu. Unexpectedly, Wu's bedroom was above the reception room, and the door was not yet open. The three bypassed it by going through the eastern wing room to reach Wu's bedroom. At that time, Wu had just finished using the toilet and was pulling up his pants, coming out from behind the bed. As soon as the three thugs saw Wu, like hawks seizing a sparrow, they pried open the door of the guest room and dragged Wu to the top of the stairs. They then aimed their box cannons at Wu's body, firing four shots.</p>
<p>Taken to the Hospital by Car   Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the three thugs immediately staggered downstairs, called out the one who was monitoring, and left through the back door, fleeing through the alley. At that time, the police officers nearby heard the sound and rushed to the scene, encountering the thugs and exchanging over ten shots, but none hit their target. Meanwhile, those downstairs in Wu's residence who were being monitored initially heard four gunshots from upstairs and knew that something was wrong. However, under the threat of the thugs, they dared not make a sound. After seeing the thugs completely escape through the back door, they rushed upstairs to check, but Wu was already at his last gasp, lying at the top of the stairs. Wu's concubine, Zhang, urgently reported the incident by telephone to the First Fleet Command of the Navy. She used her own car to rush Wu to Renji Hospital in the Maijiaquan area for treatment.</p>
<p>Succumbed to Injuries   When Wu arrived at the hospital, he was already unconscious. Dr. Chen Cheng and the head nurse first examined his injuries. It was found that he had been shot four times. One bullet entered from the left corner of his mouth, angled upwards, and exited from the occipital bone at the back of his neck, causing all the upper and lower teeth on the left side to fall out. One bullet entered from the right chest, penetrating the back. One bullet entered from the left side of his body but did not penetrate. One bullet pierced the tibia of his right leg. All the bullets hit vital parts of his body. At that time, Wu's breathing became increasingly rapid, his eyes slightly open, and his condition was extremely tragic. According to Dr. Chen, in such a situation, his life was already hopeless. He died in room 286 of the hospital at 11:25 AM. His concubine, Madam Zhang, was by his side, crying loudly in grief, causing those present to feel sorrow.</p>
<p>Wen Investigated   After receiving the report, Jin Tian, the chief of the Second District of the Public Security Bureau in charge of the area, immediately led detectives such as Han Ruisheng to Wu's residence in Ningkangli. The thugs had already disappeared. Chief Jin found three false teeth and two bullets dropped by the thugs beside Wu's body and immediately took them back for filing. He also left a police officer to guard Wu's residence to prevent unauthorized access. He also reported the incident to Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Government. After receiving the report, Director Wen personally went to Wu's residence by car to investigate and questioned the police officers nearby before returning to the bureau. At the same time, he ordered the Second District to secretly investigate with the Wujin District Chief to arrest the thugs as soon as possible to uphold the law.</p>
<p>Previously Attacked Once   This was the second time that Mr. Wu had been attacked. In 1927, when Yang Shuzhuang was the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Mr. Wu was the Chief of Staff of the Navy Department. At that time, at the same location, he was also attacked by someone. One bullet hit his mouth, knocking out three teeth. Wu fell to the ground in extreme pain. The thugs mistakenly believed that he had been fatally wounded and immediately fled. Wu was treated at Renji Hospital and recovered. After several years, it was unexpected that he would be killed now. Furthermore, according to people in naval circles, it was said that it might be due to official matters, as Wu was usually very upright and easily offended people. He might not have known it, but others had developed deep grudges against him. Three years ago, someone tried to assassinate Wu, and a bullet hit his lower jaw, but he did not die. It was unexpected that he would be attacked again this time. This might be the person who held a grudge from three years ago, it is said.</p>
<p>Dispute over Transporting the Body   At 2:00 PM, Mr. Ma Dejian, a relative of Wu and currently an employee of the arsenal, notified the International Funeral Parlor by telephone to send a car to the hospital to transport Wu's body to the parlor in preparation for the encoffining ceremony today. When the car arrived at the hospital, the police forbade the body from being moved because it had not been examined by the court. Later, Mr. Ma, together with Wu's second son, Bao Yue, went to the Second District Public Security Bureau to ask Chief Jin Tian to exempt the body from examination so that it could be transported to the International Funeral Parlor. Chief Jin did not dare to decide on his own and took a car to the Public Security Bureau to consult Director Wen. At that time, Mr. Wen was in a meeting, and the First Section used the telephone to notify the old patrol station on Simalu Road, requesting permission to transport Wu's body to the funeral parlor first, and that the local court would send someone to examine it today. Chief Jin and Patrol Officer Fan accompanied Wu's son and Mr. Ma in the same car to the patrol station. The patrol station sent someone to the Renji Hospital to have Wu's body transported to the funeral parlor by a hearse. It was already 4:00 PM. It was said that the encoffining ceremony was scheduled for 5:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Naval Condolences   After the assassination of Mr. Wu, the Hydrographic Bureau immediately reported the details to the Navy Department in Nanjing. The Navy Department sent Zhang Jiwei, stationed in Shanghai, to Wu's residence to express condolences. According to Zhang, the reason for Wu's assassination was still unknown. The Navy Department will provide a pension according to regulations. As for the successor to the position of Director, it has not yet been determined. The Navy Department is still considering it. After the assassination of Director Wu, the Navy Department also notified the Public Security Bureau, requesting them to strictly arrest the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Wu’s Resume   Wu Guangzong, courtesy name Yuqing, was from Minhou, Fujian, and was 63 years old. He graduated from the Mawei Naval Academy and held the rank of Rear Admiral. He served as Captain of the Navy's Fu'an warship, Chief of the Military Guard Section, Counselor of the Navy Department, and Chief of Staff of the Navy Headquarters. He was currently the Director of the Hydrographic Bureau. He was highly respected in the Navy. He had one wife and two concubines. His second concubine, Zhang, was residing in Shanghai and was 40 years old. The others remained in Fujian. He had a bodyguard in Shanghai, named Xu Hua, and two maids, one named Qiuhong and one named Dongmei. He had three sons and two daughters. The eldest son was 18 years old and studying at the Fuzhou Naval Academy. The second son was 16 years old and studying at St. John's University in Shanghai. The third son was 15 years old and studying at Zhengshi Middle School in Shanghai. Both daughters were studying at St. Mary's Hall in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Loss of Northeast Aviation Rights</h3>
<p>Puppet State Issues Tax Notices</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Face Difficulties</p>
<p>After Japan recognized the puppet state on September 15th, the customs offices in Dalian, Andong, and Yingkou in the Northeast began to levy taxes, hindering the operation of Chinese ships. Northeast aviation rights have been completely lost, and this has impacted the livelihood of people domestically. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Taxation  After Japan’s recognition, the puppet state announced that the customs offices in Dalian, Andong, and Yingkou would, from September 25th onwards, levy tonnage taxes on all incoming merchant ships. If taxes are not paid, ship permits will be refused, and ships will be prohibited from sailing. Goods entering and leaving Andong, Yingkou, and Dalian would also be subject to customs duties from that day forward according to the established puppet state tax rates. Previously, Chinese goods traded between these three ports were not subject to taxes, but now all goods are taxed. Refusal to pay would result in the goods being seized and fined.</p>
<p>Changing Routes   Chinese merchant ships operating in the Northeast include those of the Haichang, Zhengji, Zhaoxing, and Yu Da shipping companies in Shanghai. Since the September 18th Incident last year, these companies have hired Japanese crew members and flown the flag of the puppet state in order to barely survive. Now that Japan has recognized the puppet organization and signed treaties with it, the survival of these Chinese ships has become problematic. Without a treaty, they cannot trade. Therefore, Chinese ships are being prohibited from sailing. These shipping companies currently have no definite plans. If the puppet state prohibits Chinese ships from sailing after September 25th, the companies plan to transfer their existing ships to various seaports in North China temporarily to maintain operations.</p>
<p>Grains   The Northeast produces large quantities of soybeans, soybean oil, coarse grains, and corn, most of which are shipped to the interior of the country, especially to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen. The largest volumes are transported between March/April/May and October, amounting to over 100,000 tons annually. Now that this route has been cut off, it will significantly impact the nation's food supply. Grain merchants in Shanghai and Guangzhou have discussed this matter and plan to replace the needed coarse grains with goods from Haizhou, the Yangtze River, and the Longhai area domestically. However, statistics show that only a portion of the coarse grains can be replaced, while the shortage of oils is significant, and there is no remedy.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships  The number of Japanese ships in Dalian has been increasing daily, and more new ships were added last year. Now that a secret agreement has been made with the puppet state, coastal shipping rights in the Northeast have been completely ceded to Japanese ships. The Dalian Steamship Company has deployed new ships such as the Kunshan Maru, Shandong Maru, and Hebei Maru on special routes between Yingkou and Andong. The Osaka Shosen Kaisha, Near Seas Steamship Company, and six other shipping companies have also deployed a large number of ships to the Northeast to gain exclusive shipping benefits. It is also said that from September 25th, Japanese ships sailing to the Northeast will collect only 60% of the listed freight and passenger fares to benefit the people of the Northeast temporarily. After a short period, the fares will be increased.</p>
<p>Impact  Foreign ships in Shanghai continue to sail to the Northeast as usual, but their business has plummeted. After September 25th, they may also face the issue of being prohibited from sailing without a treaty. Furthermore, Chinese shipping companies in Shanghai will also suffer collateral damage. After Chinese ships from the Northeast cease operations, they will inevitably move to the North and South Seas. Under the current circumstances, there is already a shortage of goods and an excess of ships. Adding more ships will only exacerbate the situation, leading to losses for everyone.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing Telephones for Assistance</h3>
<p>Lacking in Both Military Supplies and Ammunition</p>
<p>Zhu Jiqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army and member of the Central Committee, urgently telegraphed the army’s Tianjin liaison office to request supplies of funds and ammunition. After receiving the telegram, the liaison office, in addition to trying to allocate funds and supplies, also telegraphed Pan Yunchao, director of the Shanghai liaison office of the army’s headquarters, to request the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association to allocate funds for ammunition. It is said that the association will remit funds soon.</p>
<h3>Detailed Report of the Attack on Shenyang</h3>
<p>General Zhu Qinglan sent a telegram to the Shanghai Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang Compatriots Relief Association, stating: “My telegram of the 30th of last month briefly described the work of Wang Lantian (Sheng Yu) in Shenyang on the 29th of last month. Please announce this. Received a reply from Dong saying that the telegram had arrived in Shenyang and that since I am not acting as the primary representative, there is no need to announce it.” It can be seen that the previous telegram must not have been announced. I believe that success need not be attributed to me. In the future, reports from the front should still be reported to the public. According to the report from Sheng Yu in Peiping and the disclosure of telegram communications, it is confirmed that at 10 PM on the 28th of last month, the various volunteer armies, led by Sheng Yu and Wang Dawei (Lantian), totaling over 3,000 men, infiltrated the city of Shenyang from the east, west, and north. As a result of the fierce battle with the puppet troops and police, in addition to killing and wounding over 20 police officers, over 10 Japanese were killed (including several Japanese officers). Over 110 enemy military and police rifles were seized. They then surrounded the radio station, destroying several important pieces of equipment. Finally, they approached the Japanese supply station, killing 20 or 30 puppet troops, police, and Japanese officers, seizing several swords, ammunition, clothing, and hats of the wounded and dead Japanese officers. When they approached the aircraft factory, they burned over 70 aircraft. Based on this, it is confirmed that this is the result of the work previously assigned to Wang Lantian and others by this association, which has been verified. I am reporting this again. Please consider announcing it to all parties.” Attached is a copy of Sheng Yu’s report. Zhu Qinglan, with seal.</p>
<h3>Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>Patriotic Support Association’s Received Battle Reports</p>
<p>The Peiping Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang Compatriots Relief Association telegraphed its Shanghai office, stating: "Recently received a truncated telegram from Yang Shouxu (Binlou), stating, 'Zhu Jiangjun Jian, and forwarded to Chairman Wu Yushi, Commander Wang, and Mr. Pei Weng Wu Shan, Kang Yuan, Junjie Xiao, Mianzhong, Shouting, and Xiaodie, Tu Sun, Yao, Li, He, Tang Gentlemen Jian. Jiang Shanheng and Zhao Zizhen were previously dispatched to return to Shanghai to report the details, which you should understand. Xu returned from Donghuang to Harbin in July to complete his work and then transferred to Fujin, then walked to Baoqing to see Ding, transferred to Mishan, and went to Lizhen to see Li. Due to difficult muddy conditions, he arrived in Hulin on September 2nd. The morale in the places he has been is greatly boosted. He has now started negotiations with 囗囗, which is quite smooth. Other details will be reported in a separate letter and sent to Shanghai by post from the 囗境, which is expected to arrive. The results of the negotiations will be telegraphed at any time. The truly anti-Japanese people in the Northeast are Ding, Li, and Wang in Jilin and their subordinates Gong, Feng, and Yang, etc. Li and Ma in Heilongjiang have a strong force, but each department lacks clothing, food, weapons, and ammunition to the extreme and must be actively remedied. There is no detailed investigation of Liaoning. Please carefully contact the so-called representatives of the Volunteer Army in Shanghai to avoid being deceived. Xu bears this important task and is afraid of overstepping, and hopes to be given advice from time to time so that he can follow it.' Telegram from Yang Shouxu, etc., Special delivery.”</p>
<p>Another telegram stated: “According to Wu Lei Yuan, on August 18th, the troops of his department, Li Dianchen, made contact with the puppet troops thirty miles south of Changchun for two hours. Our side suffered four casualties, two dead. The next day, at Shelingkouzi, west of Yixi, fifty miles south of Changchun, there was another fierce battle with the puppet troops for five hours. Our army fought bravely, and the enemy army could not support it. In this battle, our side suffered more than ten injuries, and the enemy suffered more than twenty injuries. On the 20th, they attacked Chaluhe and made contact with the puppet troops, with fierce fighting for one day. Although the puppet troops resisted stubbornly, our army was brave and was finally defeated. The enemy's barracks were burned, and three guns and two horses were seized. On the 21st, our army advanced to Shuangyang via Changlingzi, the enemy's defense was very strong, and the battle was very fierce. Our army focused on the left and right flanks to encircle the city, and the enemy was isolated inside and outside, and the military's morale was shaken, and the order was chaotic. Then, representatives Li Yingzhou and others were sent to communicate with our army, willing to accept the reorganization, just as the entire second detachment of the Japanese army arrived and attacked our army very heavily. Our side felt the disparity between the few and the many and the pressure of the artillery fire and had to retreat to the area of Nianzigou. In this battle, our army suffered more than forty injuries and more than twenty deaths, and lost twenty-four large and small guns. The actual number of enemy casualties is unknown. Although our army has suffered a severe injury this time, the officers and soldiers have not diminished their determination to kill the enemy and save the country, and will plan to attack again after the replenishment is complete." I hope you will publicize it to all parties." Lan Seal Qiao.</p>

<h3>The Oriental</h3>
<p>Nianhong Electric Company's Righteous Act</p>
<p>Donated 160 Silver Dollars to the Northeast Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army fought bravely and hard, bringing glory to the nation, and is worthy of our admiration. The employees of the Oriental Nianhong Electric Company donated a day's salary to the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, totaling 160 silver dollars, to provide condolences. Although the amount is small, the righteous act is commendable. The Northeast has been occupied for a year, and not only are the volunteer armies lacking in pay and equipment and in dire straits, but countless civilians have also been displaced. I hope that you will donate generously to save the Northeast, which is the obligation of all citizens.</p>

<h3>Results of Yesterday's Deliberation by the Abolish War Association</h3>
<p>Push Zhang Boling to Shandong to Stop the War</p>
<p>Send Telegrams to Various Groups in Jinan and Yantai to Actively Take Action</p>
<p>The Abolish Civil War League, in light of the outbreak of the Shandong war and the urgent need to eliminate it, in addition to having telegraphed Han Fuju and Liu Zhennian to stop the war the day before, and requesting Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie to mediate, yesterday at noon, standing committee members Wu Daquan, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai (represented by Xu Jisu), Secretary-General Yan Esheng, and others convened another meeting. Considering the urgency of the situation, they publicly nominated Standing Committee Member Zhang Boling to represent the League and travel to Shandong as soon as possible to earnestly persuade the authorities to stop the war. At the same time, they sent telegrams to the Jinan Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Silver and Money Guilds, and the Yantai Chamber of Commerce to take active action to achieve the goal of eliminating the war. The original telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Zhang Boling: To Mr. Zhang Boling of Nankai University in Tianjin: The outbreak of the Shandong war urgently requires a way to eliminate it. In addition to sending telegrams to persuade Han and Liu and entrusting Mayor Shen to mediate, the situation is becoming increasingly urgent, and it is feared that verbal and written statements alone will not suffice. We have long admired your enthusiasm and high reputation. We unanimously nominate you to travel to Shandong as soon as possible to represent this League and earnestly present the case to the authorities, so as to achieve the effect of pulling back from the brink. In addition to informing Chairman Han by telegram, we hereby send this telegram to request your assistance. Respectfully, the Abolish Civil War League General Headquarters, Ma.</p>
<p>Telegram to Various Groups: To the Jinan Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Silver and Money Guilds (sent separately), the Yantai Chamber of Commerce, and to be forwarded to all groups: The war clouds are spreading over Jiaodong, how can we not feel grief and indignation? The national crisis is increasingly urgent, how can we endure civil war? In addition to sending telegrams to Chairman Han and Liu Chang to stop the war and requesting Mayor Shen to mediate, we have today publicly nominated Standing Committee Member Zhang Boling to represent us and travel to Shandong to persuade them to stop. Your associations, as members of this League, have an inescapable responsibility. We urge you to take active action to find ways to eliminate the war. No matter what the problem, it should be resolved politically, not by resorting to force, which will only bring laughter from foreign enemies. Please telegraph your proposed course of action immediately. Respectfully, the Abolish Civil War League General Headquarters, Ma.</p>
<p>Han’s Telegram to Jiang Jieshi: Han Fuju's representative in Shanghai yesterday released a clever telegram from Han to Chairman Jiang, which said (excerpt omitted): Liu Zhennian, Commander of the Division, has been stationed in eastern Shandong for five years. At this time of great difficulty, we had hoped to work together and provide mutual assistance. Who would have thought that according to a confidential report, the bandits in his defense area were planning a joint uprising on September 1st? When we sent personnel to investigate, we found that it was not a joint uprising of bandits, but a group of people suffering from the exactions of his troops, unable to live and unable to die, vowing to sacrifice many lives to jointly drive them out and never coexist with them. We immediately ordered the county to suppress them with all their might, and fortunately, no incident occurred. Recently, the self-defense civilians in the area have united in groups, and bandits have also taken the opportunity to rise up, becoming very rampant. Since Yantai is located at the key point of the Yellow and Bohai Seas, and foreign ships have been constantly coming and going since the September 18th Incident, it is of utmost importance. How should the Commander of the Division stationed there appease the people and properly plan defense to eliminate potential troubles? But he is unaware of the people's suffering and indifferent to the difficulties of the times, only seeking to extort money from the people to fill his pockets, allowing the bandits in the area to run rampant without any fear, and turning a deaf ear. I, Fuju, bear the sole responsibility for the security of the entire province, so I sent a small number of troops to jointly suppress the bandits with the Commander of the Division to appease the people. The Commander of the Division actually regards the defense area as his private territory and suddenly uses force to resist, which is very aggressive. Although I wanted to avoid conflict, it was impossible. At first, I thought it was a misunderstanding, but when I went east, I realized that he harbored malicious intentions and had other plans. I have investigated that the Commander of the Division has been entrenched in eastern Shandong, with the nature of a jackal or wolf. In recent years, he has been extorting money under the pretext of raising military funds. He uses kidnapping to extort large sums of money from the wealthy gentlemen and people in the defense area. According to reports, he once extorted 2.5 million silver dollars from Huang County in one instance. There are many other cases of extortion of 100,000 or 200,000 silver dollars, which are too numerous to mention. The people are complaining and unable to survive, and they all have the intention of perishing with him. The letters and telegrams of complaint received by my office have piled up to a foot in height. In April last year, the Shandong Fellow Association in Beiping sent a telegram detailing the suffering of military expenses in Jiaodong, which was also submitted to the National Government and is on file. Fuju, on behalf of the people, has repeatedly sent personnel to persuade him to take into consideration both the military and the people after the chaos, hoping to move his conscience and repent. However, he turned a deaf ear to the advice and intensified his demands. Moreover, the regular and miscellaneous taxes collected in the counties under his defense have totaled more than one million this year, which has already been retained for use. At this time of financial constraints, all departments are like this. Fuju believes that the national funds should be used for national purposes, and there is nothing wrong with that. Not only did I not prohibit or obstruct him, but I also sent personnel to negotiate and telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds to maintain his expenses. However, the army is squandering national funds, and it does not protect the local people. It is already unforgivable not to suppress bandits, and it is even more outrageous to prevent the suppression of bandits. Such an army that cannot protect the people and harms them is a great scourge to the country and a parasite of the people, even worse than the bandits who disturb the area. At this time when the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious, if unfortunately it leads to a major change, provokes foreign relations, and affects the whole body with one hair, how can Fuju bear this great responsibility? Moreover, since this year, the victims in various counties have been kneeling and crying, and their complaints have been endless. The defense area is also under the jurisdiction of Shandong, and those people are also citizens of Shandong. Fuju's responsibility is involved, and I cannot shirk my duty. I dare not abandon them and invite condemnation. Driven by my conscience, in order to protect the national defense and local security, and to relieve the suffering of the people, I vow to drive out this troublemaker to save the people's lives. I respectfully ask for your understanding of all my difficult circumstances. I hereby report this by telegram, and I beg you to consider it," and so on. I have heard.</p>
<p>Han's Telegram to Shanghai: After the conflict between Han and Liu occurred, Han's representative in Shanghai telegraphed Han to inquire about everything. He received two replies in total, which are recorded as follows (excerpt omitted): I have received your telegram with respect. The harsh rule of Liu in Jiaodong has aroused popular uprisings. On the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, self-defense forces rose up in Laiyang, Pingdu, and Yexian. Our army stopped changing defenses to protect overseas Chinese and appease the people, and there was no conflict. The outside world is mistaken in its reports. I hereby reply by telegram," and so on. I have heard. Another telegram (excerpt omitted): I have received your clever telegram. This time, it was a conflict between local people's organizations and Liu, not the militia. My brother has led troops to Weixian to suppress them, and everything will be fine soon. I hereby reply.</p>
<h3>Yantai and Longkou Have Not Yet Been Blockaded</h3>
<p>Current Situation in Yantai and Longkou: After the outbreak of war in Jiaodong, people in Yantai and Longkou are in a state of panic. Yesterday, a shipping company in Shanghai received a telegram from Zhifu stating that the people in Longkou are very alarmed and that Yantai is also under strict guard. However, the seaports of Yantai and Longkou have not yet been blockaded, and merchant ships can still pass through. However, many residents of the two ports have been taking ships to Tianjin and Shanghai in recent days. Banks in Longkou have also moved their cash to other places.</p>
<p>Liu's Army Seizes Ships: Liu's army in Longkou Port has seized many small ships for military use and has retained a large ocean-going ship for emergency use. The ship has already been fired up and is ready to depart. Merchants in Yantai and Longkou have telegraphed various ports to temporarily suspend loading large quantities of imported goods to avoid accidental losses.</p>
<p>Shanghai Ships Still Operating: The Shanghai Three Companies' Northern Ocean liners operating between Yantai and Tianjin are still operating as usual. According to Mr. Liu, the director of the business department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the area where Han and Liu are fighting is still more than 100 miles away from Yantai, so Yantai has not been affected by the war. The Bohai Fleet has not sent ships to Yantai to blockade the seaport. Our company's ships can still sail there. If the war reaches Yantai, Liu's army will have already resolved the issue, and there should be no problems.</p>
<h3>Chairman Shao of Gansu Province</h3>
<p>Welcomes Investment from Shanghai Banking Circles</p>
<p>National Products Exhibition to Be Held Next Spring</p>
<p>Chairman Shao of Gansu Province sent a letter to Chairman Wang of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, welcoming investment from Shanghai banking circles. The original letter is published below: Brother Xiaolai, I have enclosed Chairman Zhang's letter from Lanzhou, in which he argues that it is truly beneficial to establish a bank in Gansu. Please forward it to the Banking Association and ask them to invite leaders to seriously plan. I can solemnly declare that the provincial government will never borrow money from the bank by force, no matter how difficult it may be, and will certainly fulfill its responsibility to protect it. Recently, the China Industrial Bank sent a letter to Brother Lin Liehu, expressing its willingness to set up a branch here. I have expressed my welcome. I have heard that there is a lot of idle capital in Shanghai, and the West is known for its abundant profits. It would be even better if the banking circles could come here to operate and make plans to invest in industries. The National Products Exhibition is already being planned. Shanghai merchants intend to change it to February or March next year, and we plan to do the same. Other matters discussed are being properly studied by the Department of Construction and will be replied to soon. I have heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already forwarded the letter to the Banking Association for review.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways' Plan for Business Reorganization</h3>
<p>Yu Yan in Charge of Reorganization</p>
<p>Implementation of Five Major Plans</p>
<p>Since Gu Mengyu became the Minister of Railways, he has been aware of the corruption and decline of the national business and has planned to start a fundamental reorganization. He immediately transferred Councilor Yu Yan to be the Director of the Business Department, assigning him the responsibility of reorganization. In recent months, it has been heard that many reforms have been made. A reporter visited the responsible authorities of the Ministry in Beijing yesterday and received a detailed account, which is recorded as follows: Implementing Responsible Transportation: For the past 51 years, Chinese railways have not been responsible for transporting goods. If there are any losses, merchants cannot claim compensation from the railway. Therefore, if there is a waterway available, merchants will choose water transportation. Where there is no water transportation, they will entrust transportation companies to transport the goods. The transportation companies charge more than twice the railway transportation fee, increasing the cost of goods, reducing the operating power of merchants and the purchasing power of the people at the same time, and causing the amount of goods transported by the railway to plummet. Today's national treasury is poor and the people are poor, and this is not without its impact. Last year, the Beining Railway only selected a few stations to implement responsible freight transportation. In the middle, it was hit by the September 18th Incident, and the lines outside the pass were completely seized. However, in nine months, only a part of the responsible freight transportation increased the revenue by more than 3.3 million yuan. The advantages and disadvantages of responsible freight transportation can be clearly seen. It is heard that the Ministry has first determined the procedures for implementing responsible freight transportation on various lines since May of this year and has formulated various regulations for responsible transportation. Although the transportation industry has jointly opposed it in the middle, social figures, after the Ministry separately held meetings in Beijing and Shanghai, inviting representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations, banking associations, and the press, have gradually realized that responsible transportation cannot be delayed any longer and have expressed their sympathy. At present, Jinpu, Jinghu, and Huning lines have already been implemented, and merchants are very enthusiastic about entrusting transportation. It is expected that the long-standing problems of the railway will be eliminated from now on, freight transportation will be smooth, and the agricultural, industrial, and commercial industries of the provinces along the line will benefit from it. As for the railway itself, if it can be promoted nationwide and the long-standing problems can be swept away, the annual income will increase to at least 40 to 50 million yuan (the current annual income is only 18 million yuan).</p>
<p>Strive for Salt Consumption Allowance: Salt is inevitably eroded by wind and rain during transportation from the place of production to the place of sale, so the salt yards have always allowed the transportation of a certain amount of non-taxable salt outside the taxed and reported salt to make up for it, which is called consumption allowance. Although it is a consideration for salt merchants, it still loses a lot of national tax every year. The salt from Haizhou is transported to Jiangsu and Anhui by ship, transported to the Yangtze River area, and sold to various places. Land transportation uses the Longhai and Jinpu lines, but water transportation is given a 9% consumption allowance per 100 jin, while land transportation is only given 5%, which is equivalent to water transportation being able to avoid 4% more national tax. Therefore, salt merchants all tend to water transportation. The business of foreign ships transporting salt in Haizhou is very developed, and the salt transportation of the Longhai and Jinpu lines has plummeted. The consumption allowance method is bound to damage the national tax, and the operation of state-owned railways is also seized by foreign ships. The public suffers double losses, and it is necessary to reform it. According to the Ministry's investigation, if the consumption allowance method is completely cancelled, the Ministry of Finance can increase salt tax by more than 1.5 million yuan per year, or reduce the water transport consumption allowance to 5 jin, so that the benefits of water and land transportation are equal, and the salt tax can also be increased by about 700,000 yuan per year. As for the railway business, as long as the above two items are implemented on average, the salt carried by foreign ships can be absorbed, and the annual income can also be increased by more than 2 million yuan. It is heard that the Ministry has consulted the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Mail Transportation Fees: The railway charges 1 cent per kilometer per cubic meter for transporting mail, which is less than the transportation cost of each line and only one-seventh of the sixth-class freight rate. The railway suffers a great loss. According to a detailed survey, the total amount of mail transported last year was more than 530,000 tons. If calculated at the sixth-class freight rate, the railway lost more than 3 million yuan. If calculated at the parcel freight rate, the loss was more than 26 million yuan, and the original parcel transportation of the railway declined. In order to maintain the cost of the railway, we have vigorously consulted with the Ministry of Communications to seek a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Increasing Vehicle Transportation Capacity: The vehicles of various lines have been damaged and seized in many military operations, and they are all suffering from insufficient vehicle use. Now, after an accurate investigation by the Business Department of the Ministry, it is found that many vehicles are wasted due to improper operation and scheduling or excessive time spent loading and unloading goods. The highest efficiency is only 20 vehicles per 100 vehicles, and the lowest is only 5%. It is not enough to meet the needs if the operation method is not improved. The Department has set a standard for the ton-kilometers of heavy vehicles on each line and ordered the vehicle department of each line to report the ton-kilometers of heavy vehicles every day for effective supervision. If it does not meet the specified standard, the reasons for its improvement will be studied to ensure that it meets the standard. We have also ordered each line to load and unload goods at night to save time. It is estimated that if these two measures are implemented, the vehicle transportation efficiency will increase by at least four times. That is, the current 12,000 vehicles in the country can be invisibly increased to 48,000 vehicles, and the total revenue of the railway can also be increased from 180 million yuan to 40 to 50 million yuan. This is absolutely possible, but it requires the implementation of responsible transportation throughout the country.</p>
<p>Driving Material Consumption Standards: Driving materials are mainly coal and oil, and other materials such as gauze are also expensive. The annual cost is more than 1 million yuan, but there is actually a lot of waste and theft. For items such as coal and oil, the Ministry has now sent personnel to monitor the amount used on the train to prevent waste. The amount obtained from the monitoring will be used as the consumption standard, and each line will be strictly ordered to comply with it and not to exceed it arbitrarily. If the specified standard is implemented in the future, the road funds can be saved by 5 to 6 million yuan per year. In summary, the current total annual operating income of the national railway is only 180 million yuan. If the planned plan is implemented, it should reach more than 450 million yuan after three years. As for the pure profit, according to the first item of implementing responsible transportation throughout the country, coupled with vehicle scheduling and operation, meeting the standards set in the fourth item, the pure profit of these two items alone can reach 250 million yuan per year. In addition, the second item of the salt consumption allowance case, if it can be done, can increase the income by 2.5 million yuan per year. The third item increases the mail transportation fee, which can increase the income by 5 million yuan per year. The fifth item on saving driving materials can reduce the expenditure by 5 million yuan. That is, these five items alone can yield a surplus of 262.5 million yuan. Other plans are not yet included in the calculation. The above figures are based on various statistical estimates and are quite reliable. If the railway has such a large amount of money to use, it can be used to increase the construction of various lines, repair old equipment, build new lines, repay road debts, and purchase locomotives and vehicles. It can also use the surplus funds to develop the railway's ancillary forestry and mining industries, and assist in the construction of roads in various places. The above five measures may seem like local matters, but they are actually indirectly beneficial to promoting national prosperity and developing local resources. It is hoped that all parties concerned can sincerely cooperate and ensure that various measures are carried out smoothly, so that the railway will not be the only one to benefit from it.</p>
<h3>National Morality Maintenance Association</h3>
<p>Telegram Requesting Strict Investigation of Tax Evasion in Postal Packages</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the National Morality Maintenance Association, in order to expose the inside story of postal packages sent from Zhenru, Nanxiang, Songjiang, and Jiashan, said that the malpractices committed by these people resulted in the theft of national taxes and losses of no less than tens of millions of yuan per year. They requested the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications to appoint special commissioners to strictly investigate and sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government of Nanjing, which read (titles omitted): If the customs are thick and honest, the country will prosper; if the customs are thin and vulgar, the country will perish. Those who are good at observing people and countries will judge the strength of the country based on the morality of the people. Today, the morality of our people has declined, forgetting the public for private gain, and other things aside, just looking at the commercial customs declaration in a corner of Shanghai, the inside story is so heavy that it is unbearable to speak of. Generally, treacherous merchants, for the transportation of goods, often do not go to the customs to pay taxes, but secretly transport them in large quantities to Zhenru, Nanxiang, Zhoujiaqiao, and other places for mailing, or pack them in Songjiang, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and other places, and only give small benefits to the postal officials, regardless of the value of the goods or what they are sending. According to those who know the situation well, the amount of national taxes stolen and evaded every year is no less than tens of millions of yuan. Alas, darkness is so great that it is unbearable to sigh. Moreover, in this time of prohibiting the sale of enemy goods, there are often unscrupulous merchants who pass off inferior goods as national goods; when strictly prohibiting the smuggling of weapons, there are often treacherous people who hide pistols in their packages. A few months ago, Chongqing, Sichuan, inspected postal packages and found many pieces of military equipment, which can serve as a warning. Therefore, we hereby expose the inside story and request the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications to appoint special commissioners to strictly investigate and prohibit the places where packages are sent, and the provincial governments of various provinces should secretly investigate the places where packages are received, so that the traitors cannot sell their treachery, and the national tax revenue will not suffer huge theft and evasion. The future of the country depends on it. The National Morality Maintenance Association, Ma Yin.</p>

<h3>Yang Kejia</h3>
<p>Case of Transporting Japanese Cloth</p>
<p>Mobbed and Looted by the Crowd</p>
<p>Four Robbers Each Sentenced to Eight Months</p>
<p>Merchant Yang Kejia, a native of Jiading, runs the Rendaren Cotton Cloth Company at 707 North Chengdu Road, specializing in selling Japanese goods as his main business. Even at this time when the whole country is unanimously and enthusiastically boycotting Japanese goods, he is still openly selling them. The Yichangxiang Foreign Goods Company in the French Concession's Xiafei Road and the Baxianqiao Tudi Temple area are in cahoots with Rendaren, and they collude with each other. Yang Kejia divides a portion of the white-bottomed blue-striped flannel purchased in bulk to Yichangxiang. On the afternoon of the previous day, at 8:40 PM, he sent shop assistants Gu Jinbiao and Yuan Xilin to deliver 60 pieces of flannel to rickshaw pullers Jiang Taolian and Chen Decai. Fearing that accidents would happen along the way, Yang personally led Gu and Yuan to escort the rickshaws. When passing through Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road, passersby saw so many Japanese goods and could not help but feel saddened by the sight of them. They criticized him. Yang did not fear public opinion and boldly went forward. Passersby, wanting to know the truth, followed closely, and the crowd grew larger and larger. When they reached the intersection of Madan Road and Dagu Road, the crowd could no longer restrain their anger and started shouting and throwing away the Japanese goods carried by the two rickshaws. Some greedy people took the opportunity to freely take them away. In an instant, only three pieces were left on the two rickshaws. Yang and others fled. Western Constable 282, Indian Constable 325, and Chinese Constable 1328 chased and arrested the robbers. As a result, Zhao Dacai from Zhenjiang, Wu Jinlin from Tongzhou, Dong Chengshan from Yangzhou, and Kong Xianzhang from Tianjin were intercepted in the Danshui Road and Racecourse area. Dong was carrying two pieces of stolen goods, while Zhao, Wu, and Kong each had one piece. They were taken to the Xinzha Police Station and detained. Yesterday morning, the stolen goods were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Ge conducted a preliminary hearing. First, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that he was prosecuting Zhao and others for robbery and theft. He then described in detail how Yang Kejia escorted the Japanese goods and was surrounded by a crowd of about 60 people along the way, resulting in the robbery. Next, the Chinese, Western, and Indian constables reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. Yang Kejia also surrendered himself and admitted that the cloth was indeed Japanese goods and that he was sending it to Yichangxiang in Baxianqiao. He said that he only made a small commission. The judge questioned him about the source of the goods, and Yang remained silent. Later, he said that he was beaten by the crowd at the time and that his clothes were torn. Witnesses Gu and Jiang also testified that they were ordered by Yang to escort the goods and were robbed on the way. Defendants Zhao and Wu both confessed that at that time, others shouted that they were Japanese goods and asked them to carry the cloth on their behalf, and they were immediately arrested. Dong confessed that he was a tailor and was passing through Dazhan Road when he saw abandoned cloth in the middle of the road, so he picked it up. Kong also confessed that he was passing through the area when someone asked him to carry the cloth on their behalf. After the interrogation, Judge Ge announced the verdict in court. The four defendants, Zhao, Wu, Dong, and Kong, were each sentenced to eight months in prison for the crime of robbery. The stolen goods were returned to the original owner.</p>
<h3>Tragic Suicide of a Woman</h3>
<p>Knelt Before Her Husband After Taking Poison</p>
<p>Said to Take Good Care of the Children</p>
<p>— The Reason Was for Buying Too Much Fresh Meat</p>
<p>Madam Wang Zhang, age forty, from Huizhou, lived with her husband, Wang Chunyang, at No. 179 Xinqing Lane, Ai'erjin Road. Her husband was an antique dealer. The other day, she brought back a large quantity of fresh meat and other goods from Wuxi. Upon seeing this, her husband immediately said to her, "The economy is exceptionally difficult now, you should not waste money like this, especially with four children," and gently rebuked her. This caused the two of them to quarrel. Afterward, she was filled with resentment and developed a pessimistic view of life. Secretly, she took opium to end her life. After consuming it, she knew that death was imminent, so she went to her husband and knelt before him, saying, "I have already taken poison. Please take good care of our children." Her husband, upon hearing this, was extremely anxious and rushed his wife to Baolong Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. She succumbed to the poison and died at 4 PM. The hospital reported it to the Mixed Court Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was notified, and Prosecutor Zhan Liangce was appointed to inspect the body. He conducted the examination, took a seat in his official position, and interrogated the deceased's husband, Wang Chunyang, who stated that he was seventy years old and the deceased was his wife. They were usually very harmonious. The other day, he had slightly advised her against buying too much meat, and she secretly took poison. He was initially unaware until she knelt before him and told him she had ingested opium, at which point he rushed her to the hospital, but it was too late to save her. After hearing the statement, Prosecutor Zhan concluded that the deceased, Wang Zhang, was a woman who died from poisoning before death. The body was handed over to her husband, Wang Chunyang, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Old Friends of the Same Age</h3>
<p>Mutual Assault Leads to Homicide</p>
<p>Li Zhangyou Dies from Serious Injuries After Falling Down the Stairs</p>
<p>Wang Baokang's Confession is Filled with Tears</p>
<p>Wang Baokang, a native of Ningbo, age fifty-eight, owner of Rongji Machine Factory at No. 17, Yuezhou Road, lived at a certain number in the Third Section of the Fifth District of the Chinese area. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, around 1 PM, he quarreled with his old friend Li Zhangyou, a native of Gaoyou, Jiangbei, also fifty-eight years old, on the factory's upper floor over a trivial matter. Wang was angered by his disrespectful remarks and slapped him. Li retaliated fiercely, causing Wang to bleed from his face. As a result of the mutual assault, Li fell from beside the handrail of the staircase and was seriously injured. He was taken to Tongren Hospital by ambulance, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died on the 16th at 7:55 PM. The First Special District Court sent a prosecutor to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road to conduct an examination. Wang Baokang was taken into custody and interrogated by Xu Yongyuan, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Station, and then sent to the court. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong conducted a trial at the Fourth Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, presented the background of the case, stating that when Li Zhangyou was in the hospital, Detective Xu Yongyuan was dispatched to inquire about the cause of the incident. Li claimed that he had a dispute over wage demands and that the defendant had punched and kicked him, causing him to fall down the stairs. When asked a second time, Xu claimed that he had fallen from the upper floor and was injured. There was a post-mortem examination report available for review. The court ordered the bailiff to retrieve the report. Detective Xu testified that he had been ordered by Western Inspector Walter on the afternoon of the 4th at 7:30 PM to go to Tongren Hospital to inquire. Li Zhangyou said that he had been injured by the defendant and his son for arguing over wage demands. When he went a second time on the afternoon of the 7th at 3:30 PM, Li asked if he was an "Ah San" (a derogatory term for Indian policemen). He replied that he was not, but a detective from the police force. Li then said that he had actually fallen down the stairs and that Wang Baokang and his son had not hit him. Although there was no one else to prove this, he reported both investigations to Western Inspector Walter. Although Wang Baokang was nearly sixty years old, he was tall, ruddy-faced with a white beard, and very energetic. He confessed that he and the deceased had been friends for eight years. When he was fifty years old, he opened a catering business on Tangshan Road, and Li was a worker at a certain Chinese silk factory. They met when Li came to his place to eat. Later, after Li lost his job, he came to Wang and said that they were both around fifty years old, but Wang had many children and grandchildren, while Li had no wife or children, and his business had stopped, making their situations as different as heaven and earth. Wang took pity on him and had him stay at his house, doing errands and odd jobs, without charging him for food. Li had a habit of selling opium. Wang repeatedly advised him to quit, but he would not listen. The last time, Wang told him that if he did not change, he would report him to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau. On the 4th of this month, he went to a certain place in the French Concession to buy opium and was severely scolded by Wang, leading to an argument. Wang was momentarily angry and slapped him, but Li retaliated, causing Wang's face to bleed. Bystanders said that Wang had taken him in for seven or eight years and should not treat him so unreasonably. Li then fled down the stairs and accidentally fell and was injured. Wang denied kicking him and burst into tears while speaking, begging for leniency. Zhao Chunlin testified that he had been Wang's neighbor across the street for four years. At the time, he happened to be upstairs and heard them arguing. The deceased had gone to the French Concession to buy opium, but it was stolen by thugs. He was angry and accused Wang of informing others to steal the opium. He came back and made disrespectful remarks. Wang told him that he should not use opium and they started arguing and slapping each other. Li suddenly fell down the stairs and was injured, and was immediately sent to the hospital. Wang Chen, the defendant's daughter-in-law, testified that the deceased had bought six yuan worth of opium in the French Concession and was robbed. He argued with her father-in-law (the defendant). Her father-in-law slapped him first, and the deceased retaliated, causing him to bleed. Her husband, A Cai, had already returned to his hometown and did not hit him. The court reviewed the post-mortem examination report, which showed that the deceased's fourth and ninth ribs were broken. When the defendant was questioned, he insisted that Li had fallen and injured himself. The court ordered the police lawyer to summon Western Inspector Walter to provide testimony. Lawyer Zhang immediately notified him by telephone. After a while, Western Inspector Yao Ke replied by phone, stating that Western Inspector was at the British Public Hall, testifying in an Indian murder case, and could not come to court. Judge Shen ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing to another day.</p>
<h3>Suppression of Melting Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Pawnshops and Silver Smelters Have Their Own Arguments</p>
<p>Since the sudden decrease in foreign cents and the increase in silver prices in this city, the Pawnbrokers' Association has written to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting a thorough investigation and suppression of silver smelters who take high-quality silver dollars and melt them down to recast into silver ingots, resulting in inferior coins flooding the market and superior ones disappearing. The letter stated: "We respectfully report that since the sudden decrease in foreign cents and the increase in silver prices, silver smelters in Shanghai have been secretly melting high-quality silver dollars and recasting them into silver ingots. It is said that after deducting all expenses, they can make a profit of two hundred yuan per ten thousand yuan. Normally, workers in this industry earn only ten yuan per month, but now they can earn as much as five or six yuan per day and night. Tens of thousands of yuan worth of silver dollars are being melted every day. If this is true, silver dollars in the market will inevitably become increasingly scarce, and the higher quality ones are in danger of disappearing altogether. If we do not urgently suppress this, silver dollars will become even more scarce, and paper money will take the opportunity to flood the market. The future impact is unimaginable. At a time when the policy of abolishing taels and adopting yuan is about to be implemented, some argue that more silver dollars should be minted and paper money restricted as a remedy for the future. However, at this critical juncture, there is the absurd act of melting large quantities of silver dollars, which is not good for the country or society. Our association has heard about this and feels deeply concerned. We cannot remain silent and strongly suggest that your chamber promptly conduct a thorough investigation and take measures to suppress this practice to recover the losses. We would be most grateful." However, according to the Silver Smelters' Association, there are a total of nineteen silver smelters in this city, including Taifeng and others. Their business depends on the rise and fall of exchange rates. They specialize in melting large bars into silver ingots, as well as melting damaged silver dollars and small coins into silver ingots. They purely earn a handling fee during the melting process. Previously, due to the high rise in foreign cents, they were bound to lose money and could not operate, so they had to temporarily melt silver into ingots. According to the investigation, the average daily amount of silver assessed and inspected by the public valuation bureau from each silver smelter is over five thousand silver ingots. However, melting large bars makes little profit. They melt high-quality silver dollars on the market, such as "Eagle Dollars" and Yuan Shikai dollars, into silver ingots, resulting in the gradual disappearance of high-quality silver dollars and the flooding of inferior ones.</p>

<p>(3) Since the first case was discovered on April 26 of this year, it has been 144 days. In about half a month, this epidemic is expected to be completely eliminated. The Nanjing Health Department issued a statement to newspapers on September 2, stating that approximately 100,000 people in the country have been infected with cholera this year.</p>
<p>(4) Looking back at the cholera epidemic records of the recent century, there have been five major epidemics, namely 1902, 1909, 1919, 1926, and this year (1932). The trend of the epidemic's spread has been from South China to North China, gradually spreading to the interior provinces.</p>
<p>(5) This year, there were a total of 3037 cases, scattered in 16 epidemic hospitals in this city. Among them, 1831 cases were confirmed as true cholera. 320 cases were treated at the Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital, 232 cases at the Emergency Epidemic Hospital, 215 cases at the Public Works Department Isolation Hospital, and one case each at the Tangshan Road Epidemic Hospital and the Tongren Hospital Refugee Hospital. In the total of 3037 cases, males accounted for 2032 cases and females accounted for 1005 cases, which is a ratio of 66% to 34%, or roughly two males to one female.</p>
<p>(6) The detailed information about this year's cholera epidemic will be presented at the Chinese Medical Association held at the Dehe Institute from September 28 to October 5. At that time, Chinese and Western medical experts from across the country will attend to discuss this important public health issue.</p>
<p>(7) The Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office held four propaganda meetings and four infectious disease research meetings between May 16 and September 8. The participants were the health departments of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, the Health Department of the French Concession Public Works Department, the Shanghai Health Bureau, and the Seaport Quarantine Administration.</p>
<p>(8) Next week, we plan to make a final cholera report and summarize and publish the key points of this epidemic.</p>
<h3>Case of Labor Dispute at Sanyou Company</h3>
<p>Public Hearing Held Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Debate Concluded, Verdict to be Announced on the 24th</p>
<p>Summary of the Hearing: The case of Sanyou Industrial Company's dissolution of the Yinxiang District General Factory, in addition to the workers' hunger strike appeal, was arbitrated by the Arbitration Committee, ordering the factory to resume operations and accommodate one-fifth of the workers. The remaining four-fifths were permitted to be dismissed, but in the future, when the Hangzhou branch added workers, the unemployed workers from the Shanghai factory should be given priority for employment. However, Sanyou Company refused to accept this, so they hired lawyers Tan Yigong and Yu Zhongluo to file a petition with the Local Court, requesting the annulment of the arbitration decision, confirmation of the right to dismiss workers, and the return of the workshop and equipment. The defendant in the case was the Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union, represented by factory director Lao Huimin on behalf of the employers Shen Jiucheng and Wang Xianhua, who appeared in court. The defendant's union's legal representatives, Director Gong Yuting and Zhang Yihai, also hired lawyer Wei Wenhan to present a defense and counterclaim for damages. Yesterday morning at 2:00 AM, the Civil Division Two Presiding Judge Zhao Shulan, accompanied by judges Wang Run and Wang Shicheng, convened a collegial panel in the First Court. The plaintiff and their representing lawyer stated that the Sanyou Company's general factory had suffered two arson attacks by Japanese individuals before January 28th. Subsequently, it encountered the Shanghai war, was reduced to the war zone, and could no longer be maintained, so it had to dissolve the damaged and ruined factory. This had been announced in the newspapers twice. The municipal government's arbitration to retain one-fifth of the workers was not feasible, as it was impossible to determine who should be given priority. If the factory were to resume operations, all machines would naturally have to be started simultaneously, and a small number of people could not handle the work of many. Therefore, it was practically impossible to do so. From January 28th to June, the municipal government mediated, providing a daily food subsidy of 120 yuan, which was quite difficult. Regarding the Hangzhou factory accommodating unemployed workers from the Shanghai factory, the Hangzhou factory was also reducing workers, and the Hangzhou municipal government had instructed that any new additions to the Hangzhou factory must be existing workers, and if that was insufficient, then unemployed workers from various factories in Hangzhou should be placed. Referring to the municipal arbitration of this city would result in not knowing which course of action to take. This was speaking in terms of facts. Legally speaking, although there was a labor-capital contract from March of the 18th year, according to the recently promulgated Factory Law, the wording of the original contract should of course no longer be applicable, because revision of the contract implied that it should be revised accordingly, or modified. What the Arbitration Committee did was no different from trying to save someone from drowning in a well, but that the plaintiffs injuries could be examined, the arbitration should be overturned. The factory was currently occupied by workers, who were not allowed to enter, and even inspecting and repairing the equipment was not allowed. Therefore, it was requested that an order be issued for its return. The defendant's legal representative and their representing lawyer stated that the factory had grown from a capital of 300 yuan to 2 million yuan, all due to the labor of the workers, and had a history of 20 years with no labor disputes. Therefore, they never expected the matter of closing the factory to occur, and that this was completely irrational. Regarding the food expenses, the last payment was only 60 yuan, which was rejected and then not issued. The expense of 120 yuan, when calculated for over 1,000 workers, was only one jiao per person, which had to cover three meals, and left nothing for their parents and wives to live on. This was something that was bound by contract. Among the factories in the Shanghai war zone, there were dozens. After peace was restored, they had all reopened. If the factory had sincerity, why not pay the severance pay? The modification of the contract meant revisions and changes, not overturning it. It had already been decided by arbitration. The arbitration only accommodated one-fifth of the workers, while the factory obtained four-fifths. It could be seen that the factory was already being taken care of, yet they still said the arbitration was unfair. This statement was truly unjust. The workers were currently suffering terribly. What the factory lost was money, while the workers lost their bodies and lives. Of course, life was more important, and the body was precious. Could the compassion of humanity be extinguished? The contract was not ineffective, so they requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected. Regarding the counterclaim, because the factory delayed reopening and did not pay severance pay, they requested that each worker be paid from June 15th until it was received, and that this be enforced immediately. Otherwise, by the time the third trial concluded, the workers' parents and wives would have long starved to death and been buried. They requested assistance with all litigation costs. At this point, the lawyers for both sides debated legal issues extensively for a long time, until 6:00 PM, when the judge announced the conclusion of the debate. If there were no further questions, the verdict would be announced on the afternoon of the 24th.</p>
<p>Appendix: Lawsuit</p>
<p>Plaintiff: Sanyou Industrial Company Limited, located at 497 Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>Legal Representatives: Shen Jiucheng, 49 years old, from Cixi, residing at the same address, Standing Director of Sanyou Industrial Company; Wang Xianhua, 52 years old, from Cixi, residing at the same address, same as above.</p>
<p>Litigation Representative: Lao Huimin, 39 years old, from Yuyao, residing at the same address, Acting Factory Manager of Sanyou Industrial Company Yinxiang Branch.</p>
<p>Defendant: Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union, regarding disagreement with labor-capital arbitration, requesting the annulment of the original ruling and a ruling permitting dismissal.</p>
<p>(A) Declaration of Matters to be Ruled on by the Court: The arbitration decision No. 20 made by the Shanghai Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee on September 1st of this year should be annulled, confirming that the original workers of the Sanyou Industrial Company Yinxiang Port Factory have already been dismissed, and ordering the defendant to hand over the occupied parts of the factory buildings and equipment to the plaintiff for acceptance. The litigation costs should be borne by the defendant.</p>
<p>(B) Reasons for the Lawsuit: The Yinxiang Port Factory established by the plaintiff was first subjected to arson by Japanese ruffians, and after negotiations were brewing, the sudden event of the enemy disturbing Shanghai occurred on January 28th. The perilous situation was beyond what those who were calm and composed after the event could imagine. To cope with this force majeure event, on the day after the outbreak of the war, a notice was issued to all departments to stop work immediately, and all workers were therefore unemployed. Except for those who had already fled to Shanghai on their own, the rest were paid their remaining wages at the Nanjing Road headquarters within three days starting from February 15th, and the factory was dissolved. At that time, some workers negotiated with the plaintiff to provide subsidies for travel expenses to return to their hometowns and seek other livelihoods. This was because, given the situation at the time, there was absolutely no hope of the factory recovering, which was recognized by both labor and capital. Therefore, the plaintiff posted notices in the newspaper, telling employees who had left the company not to come to Shanghai, because there was no possibility of resuming work and there was no room for dispute. On April 18th, the Social Bureau, based on the request of the defendant's representative of one-tenth of the unemployed workers remaining in Shanghai, ordered the plaintiff to provide appropriate relief to the workers. At that time, the plaintiff company was finding it extremely difficult to maintain the status quo and could not come up with any solutions. Even the competent authorities that ordered the provision of relief did not provide any concrete measures. Furthermore, the plaintiff successively submitted requests to the Municipal Government and the Social Bureau, hoping they would provide relief to maintain the industry, but the results were merely being notified for questioning. On May 31st, the enemy troops left the factory, and the few workers remaining in Shanghai broke down the doors and occupied the factory on June 2nd, leading to extremes. Only then did the incident of petitioning for resumption of work arise. The time from the shutdown on January 29th to this point was already more than four months. Since then, the Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters began to negotiate with the plaintiff to borrow temporary food expenses to relieve the workers, a total of three times, amounting to 900 yuan. Subsequently, the Municipal Government forcibly ordered the plaintiff to temporarily maintain the workers' temporary food expenses, and the plaintiff was forced to reluctantly provide 120 yuan per day, which has continued to this day and has become an unbearable burden. During the mediation period, the workers behaved arbitrarily, and the factory buildings they occupied caught fire twice, burning down 28 rooms. Although the plaintiff petitioned for investigation and legal action, the competent authorities could not do anything. Only the workers organized a hunger strike group and made illegal demands, which instead aroused the excitement of various party and government departments. The Central People's Movement Committee and the Ministry of Industry successively sent telegrams to the Municipal Government, instructing them to use extraordinary measures to force the resumption of work. The Arbitration Committee, following these instructions, made a default judgment on August 31st (separately attached). The plaintiff raised an objection on September 4th. Now, in accordance with the period stipulated in Article 8 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Shanghai Labor-Capital Dispute Handling Regulations, this lawsuit is filed to seek relief. Before the implementation of the Factory Law, on March 14th of the 18th year, the plaintiff and the former Sanyou Industrial Company Workers' Union, which the defendant inherited, agreed on treatment conditions equivalent to a labor contract, Article 5 of which stated: "Workers' dismissal shall be handled in accordance with Articles 2 to 8 of the Shanghai Special Municipality Employee Retirement Treatment Interim Measures." The end of the agreement also included a note: "All articles of these conditions that comply with government-promulgated measures shall be fulfilled in accordance with the revised measures if the government revises them in the future." Since the implementation of the Factory Law on August 1st of the 20th year, the former Shanghai Special Municipality Employee Retirement Treatment Interim Measures were abolished. Regarding the issue of mutual dismissal or resignation, according to the intent of the note attached to the original agreement, it should be changed to comply with the later-promulgated Factory Law. Articles 27 to 30 of the Factory Law have clear provisions regarding the termination of labor contracts, which are sufficient to serve as the basis for resolving this case. The original ruling disregarded this and completely adopted the methods proposed by the Mediation Committee, which was a disservice to its mission. The reasons why the original ruling should be annulled are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Impossibility of Partial Resumption of Work: The Yinxiang Port Factory has a historical relationship, and each part is divided into different tasks. The more important ones can be separated into more than 20 departments. What should be chosen to reduce the work if only a part of the work is to be restored? Should the workers in one part be reduced? If the entire factory loses its operational connection, the use of large equipment to manage and harvest a small amount of production would be inconsistent with economic principles and would lead to maintenance costs. After this major crisis, the machinery and tools are incomplete, and the factory buildings are dilapidated, posing a safety hazard. Can its allocation management be limited to one-fifth? Can the execution of the ruling be permitted by the situation? Those who settle labor-capital disputes lack a deep understanding of the actual equipment management of the factory, and the economic cost, and various relationships. How is this different from building a car behind closed doors, which cannot fit on the tracks?</p>
<p>(2) The Unreasonableness of Partial Dismissal: Job loss is a problem for all, not a partial problem manipulated by a few through the labor union. It is unreasonable to think that resuming work for a part of the workers can solve the livelihood problems of all unemployed workers. The original ruling ordered the immediate resumption of work with a minimum of one-fifth of the original workers, meaning that the number of workers could be reduced from over a thousand to one or two hundred. If one or two hundred people can be accommodated, can the majority of the other four-fifths of the workers obey without question? What reasons must be given to the one or two hundred people who are resuming work first, and why should they take priority over the majority of the other four-fifths of the workers? Furthermore, how should the selection be made? It is difficult to find an answer.</p>
<p>(3) The Impossibility of Resuming Work Only at the Yinxiang Port Factory: The equipment at the Yinxiang Port Factory can be described as completely abandoned since it experienced a major crisis. This is an undeniable fact. The current domestic and international situation is difficult to predict, and the factory site is close to a powerful enemy, posing a threat at any time. Before January 28th, it was already full of fear. After January 28th, it was even more like a bird startled by the twang of a bow. Government protection is equivalent to a written statement. Even with great resources, it is appropriate to choose another location to invest. How could the plaintiff, who has suffered a setback, have a dangerous business future that has been recognized by the original ruling?</p>
<p>(4) The Impossibility of Resuming Work Within Three Months: The Yinxiang Port Factory has simple architecture and dilapidated buildings, and should have been rebuilt long ago to ensure safety, as requested by the original workers. Since it has experienced a major crisis, it has reached a point where it can no longer be used. If the current regulations for managing factories are followed, the capital and engineering required for reconstruction cannot be completed in a short period of several months. Furthermore, the plaintiff has always strived for the national goods industry. The reason why it can operate a large business with a small capital is entirely dependent on borrowing and turnover. At this time, the plaintiff has suffered war losses and has reduced creditworthiness. In a society with tight finances, borrowing is difficult. In addition, the existing debt is as high as 3 million yuan, and it is still difficult to deal with the collection of debts. There are more than 2,000 workers currently employed, making maintenance even more difficult. How can it raise huge sums of money to build new buildings now? The original ruling set a limit of three months to resume work, which is absolutely impossible in reality, and limiting the resumption of part of the work is even more illogical.</p>
<p>(5) The Lack of Basis for Continuing to Issue Food Expenses: According to the regulations for various employee services, both long and short-term, approved by the Social Bureau on November 3rd of the 20th year, no work means no wages. Furthermore, the Yinxiang Port Factory has always provided food for workers on their own. From the notice of shutdown on January 29th to the defendant's request to resume work has been over four months. According to the pre-notice period for dismissal stipulated in the Factory Law, this has exceeded several times. The workers who have stopped work are now demanding the maintenance of food expenses. The capital does not belong to the plaintiff, but the municipal government repeatedly says that the temporary burden should be borne by the plaintiff, and orders the plaintiff to reluctantly issue food expenses. Is this not something that has any basis in laws and regulations or contracts? After arbitration, it is still desired to continue the temporary measures set by the municipal government, so that a few manipulators can obtain this endless assistance. Then don't blame the wave of labor unrest and the inability to resolve disputes.</p>
<p>(6) The Ambiguity of Dismissing the Remaining Workers According to the Original Agreement: The so-called original agreement between labor and capital in the original ruling should refer to the treatment conditions equivalent to the labor contract agreed upon by both parties on March 14th of the 18th year. However, according to the note attached to the original agreement and the promulgation of the Factory Law, Article 5 of the original agreement has lost its basis with the abolition of the Shanghai Special Municipality Employee Retirement Treatment Interim Measures. In other words, the dismissal of workers no longer has a basis for requesting severance pay. The original ruling failed to examine and recognize changes in laws and regulations and the application of contracts, and ambiguously stated that the dismissal should be handled in accordance with the original agreement. This means that the four-fifths of the workers who are permitted to be dismissed will inevitably have another dispute over the existence or absence of severance pay. Before one wave subsides, another wave rises. If it is not intended to provoke discord and destroy the situation, how can it be explained?</p>
<p>(7) The Impossibility of Prioritizing the Employment of Dismissed Workers from the Shanghai Factory at the Shanghai and Hangzhou Factories: It has been stated above that the Shanghai factory has no hope of recovery. As for the Hangzhou factory itself, it was originally a yarn factory, although it had weaving machines attached, but all of it was women's work. Recently, due to the sluggish market situation, most of the original female workers have also suffered unemployment. If the Hangzhou factory has limited foreign employment orders and wants to prioritize the placement of dismissed workers from the Shanghai factory at the Hangzhou factory, not only would the nature of the work be unsuitable for both sides, but it would also be impossible in fact. Based on the above explanations, the original ruling was influenced by the party and government's orders to handle it with extraordinary means and was clearly unbalanced. It should be requested to be annulled. As for the workers at the Yinxiang factory, they had already terminated their contracts due to the shutdown due to force majeure for more than one month. The force majeure was based on the most dangerous sudden war, which could not have been foreseen in advance. Therefore, they cannot be blamed for the obligation to report in advance. However, after the shutdown, the reasons for the inability to recover were reported in detail to the competent authorities. The procedural corrections are already complete. How can the dismissed workers be allowed to occupy the factory buildings, turn the guest into the host, and destroy the situation? Therefore, it should be requested that a judgment be made confirming that the original workers have already been dismissed and ordering the defendant to hand over the occupied factory buildings and equipment to the plaintiff for acceptance. Furthermore, the damages caused during the period of the workers' occupation cannot be accurately calculated until the defendant hands over the property to the plaintiff for acceptance. The right to claim compensation at a later date should be reserved. Furthermore, the case file should be collected from the Shanghai Municipal Government for review, and this is hereby stated.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau</h3>
<p>Mediated the Candle Industry Labor Dispute Yesterday</p>
<p>Proposed Two Compromise Solutions</p>
<p>Due to the labor contract issue, a labor dispute occurred among all employees of the candle industry in this city. The Social Bureau summoned both parties for questioning at 9:00 AM yesterday. The employer representatives Shen Chengchang and He Yinsheng and the employee representatives Chen Zenghao and Luo Qinxia attended. Zhu Guilin, Chairman of the Social Bureau, presided over the meeting, and Wang Zuofang recorded the minutes. First, the employee representatives stated that Article 4 of Mediation Record No. 57 of the Labor Department stipulated that the shop has always employed workers from the Songtai gang. This should be handled in accordance with the old regulations, but it is limited to members of the Songtai Candle Industry Union. Now, the employers have violated the conditions and arbitrarily hired new workers, which has led to an increase in unemployment among union members. The employer representatives stated that the natural attrition of the candle industry has reached its limit, and the Songtai gang workers are not working effectively. Therefore, the employers hired new workers. The trade association sent personnel to various shops to advise them to comply with the conditions. The chairman briefly stated that since the labor-capital conditions were agreed upon and signed, they should be complied with. Neither party should violate them. If the employer violates them, the trade association should be fully responsible for stopping them. After lengthy debate by both labor and capital, the chairman proposed compromise solutions: (1) The original labor-capital conditions should be complied with and fulfilled by both labor and capital; (2) Newly hired workers should be required to leave within a time limit. Both parties believed that the matter was of great importance and that they needed to convene a general meeting for discussion before making a decision. The meeting was then adjourned, and it was decided to formally mediate again at 9:00 AM next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>British Public Buses</h3>
<p>New Ticket Sellers Did Not Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>Sixth District Chief Temporarily Arrived to Advise Against It</p>
<p>Company Promised to Respond Before 5:00 AM This Morning</p>
<p>Over 300 new ticket sellers of the British public bus company convened a delegates' meeting the day before yesterday, deciding to organize a strike committee and to launch a general strike starting yesterday morning. At 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the workers gathered on the company's vacant lot on Connaught Road and convened a meeting to discuss blocking the buses from leaving the factory. Upon hearing this, Tan, the chief of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, personally led 40 sergeants and policemen to the scene to maintain order. He also advised all the workers, promising to negotiate with the company authorities again with the worker representatives. If there were no results, then other measures would be taken. All the workers followed Chief Tan's advice and elected 15 representatives to negotiate with the company authorities. Factory manager Short came to receive them, saying that he had received a phone call from the general manager regarding the demands made by the workers and promised to discuss solutions. A response was scheduled for 5:00 AM the next day (i.e., today). The representatives then left and reported to all the workers that they would wait for a response today before deciding on the next course of action. Another meeting was scheduled for 5:00 AM this morning on Connaught Road. Whether or not the strike would be carried out depended on the response today. It remains to be seen whether the response will be satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Relief Work in Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>Director of Yizhen Reports to the Xinwei Association</p>
<p>Mr. Zhai Fengxiang, Director of the Anhui Branch of the China Jisheng Association's Yizhen, was appointed as the chief director of Yizhen in southern Anhui by the Shanghai-based Preparatory Committee for Urgent Relief for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces due to the severe disaster situation in Xuancheng, Guichi, and other counties in southern Anhui. He reported on the handling of the situation to the association at any time. It is now heard that the work has been completed, and all reimbursement documents have been resubmitted by Mr. Zhai to the Xinwei Relief Association after the Shanghai Preparatory Committee for Water Disaster Relief was reorganized. Here is Mr. Zhai's letter: "I was appointed by the Shanghai Preparatory Committee for Urgent Relief for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces to serve as the director of the Yizhen General Office in southern Anhui, handling winter relief in Xuancheng, Guichi, Tongling, Wuhu, Dangtu, and Fanchang counties. Later, Langxi was added, for a total of seven counties. A total of 75,000 yuan and 3,000 yuan for expenses, as well as 9,800 sets of new and old cotton clothes, were allocated successively. Receipts were issued and reported at any time, and the receipts from various counties were collected and submitted. The winter relief ticket stubs, labor relief claim forms, and weekly reports from each county have been successively mailed separately. It is estimated that all have been inspected and approved. Now, I have prepared a clear report on the expenses of the general and branch offices, as well as four copies of the clear report on various expenses of the general office, along with four books of vouchers, two copies of the clear report on expenses from each branch office, and four copies of claim forms and vouchers, all enclosed with this letter for verification and cancellation. A total of 3,121.195 yuan was spent on expenses. After deducting 117.103 yuan in interest on the urgent winter relief deposit from the Wuhu Bank of China, there is still a shortfall of 7.065 yuan, which I personally donated and do not need to be reimbursed for. As the Urgent Relief Association has been reorganized under the name of the General Assembly and is responsible for handling the conclusion of the matter, it should have been reported earlier to clear the procedures. However, I was also handling the Spring and Labor relief projects of the Shanghai Jisheng Association's Chinese and Foreign Yizhen Association, and I was overwhelmed and exhausted. Recently, I suddenly fell seriously ill for two months and did not have time to personally organize the reports. After this letter and various reports are sent, I will have no unfinished business with the Urgent Relief Association. I am returning the original seal of the Yizhen General Office in southern Anhui separately by mail for verification and confirmation."</p>

<h3>Public Concession Health Conditions</h3>
<p>The August report of Dr. Zhou Deng, Director of the Public Health Department of the Public Works Department, has been published. The summary is as follows:</p>
<p>August Mortality Rate: In August of this year, the mortality rate for foreigners inside and outside the concession was 12.63 per thousand, and the mortality rate for Chinese was 13.22 per thousand. This figure for Chinese deaths may not be entirely accurate. The majority of deaths were due to tuberculosis and cholera.</p>
<p>Cholera Gradually Coming to an End: This cholera epidemic reached its peak in mid-July, and then gradually decreased. By the end of August, it was no longer of significant nature. Barring unforeseen circumstances, this year's epidemic can be said to be over. In 1919, the number of cholera deaths was 9.78 per ten thousand, 4.48 in 1926, 1.56 in 1929, and 1.45 up to the end of August this year. Therefore, this year's epidemic can still be considered serious but not large. A total of 170,000 cholera vaccinations were administered this year. General Overview of Infectious Diseases: The most important infectious disease in August was cholera, with 438 cases among Chinese and foreigners within the concession and 59 deaths. Outside the concession, 1,195 patients sought medical treatment, with 98 deaths. There were 2,258 cases of dysentery among Chinese, with 20 deaths, and 46 cases among foreigners, with no deaths. According to reports, there were 76 cases of tuberculosis among Chinese, with 56 deaths. Among foreigners, there were 5 deaths from typhoid fever. There were 2 cases of typhoid fever among foreigners, with 1 death, and 41 cases among Chinese, with 30 deaths. In addition, there were 30 cases of influenza among Chinese and 12 cases of malaria among foreigners. No other significant cases were reported.</p>
<p>Pathological Testing Work: The Pathological Testing Laboratory issued 2,925 doses of smallpox vaccine and 53,826 doses of mold vaccine in August. Fifty cases of rabies prevention treatment were performed. 2,492 samples were received for testing, and 241 analyses were performed. In addition, 45,2190 doses of cholera vaccine were issued. In addition to various bacteria, several types of breast milk and mosquitoes were examined.</p>
<p>Fewer Hospital Patients: The number of patients admitted to the Bureau's isolation hospital this month was the lowest in recent years. The number of patients in the Chinese Isolation Hospital was also not large. The condition of patients in the Tuberculosis Sanatorium did not improve much due to the hot weather. Two patients were admitted and two were discharged this month. The mental hospital remains crowded. There were nine requests for admission, but only four were admitted. The patrol hospital admitted some patients with diarrhea and influenza. The health of prisoners, on the other hand, was quite good.</p>
<p>Veterinary Office Report: The average daily milk production this month was 18,560 pounds. Milk inspections found five cases of adulteration with water. Fifty-nine microbial inspections were performed, of which 20 did not meet Grade A standards. One dairy farm was ordered to suspend sales for failing to comply with recommendations, and five others were fined, ranging from 25 to 80 yuan. A dairy farm owner in Jiangwan was sentenced to six months in prison for operating without a license. Six herds of cattle, totaling 337 heads, were inspected. Forty-eight sick cattle were disposed of, and 23 were not inspected. Nineteen of them had bitten people, but no cases of rabies were found.</p>
<p>Food Inspection Situation: The revenue from vegetable market rentals increased significantly this month, with Beijing Road and Xinzha Road being the most prosperous. Special attention has been paid to bakeries. Several butchers were warned for selling water buffalo tongue. A total of 124 cases of violations were prosecuted. The average daily number of animals slaughtered in the Bureau's slaughterhouses was 110 cattle, 133 sheep, 32 calves, and 58 pigs. The number of animals rejected for not meeting standards this month was 40 cattle, 3 sheep, 3 calves, and 14 pigs. The private slaughterhouses slaughtered a total of 46,026 pigs this month, and 3,143 were rejected after inspection.</p>
<p>The Cleaning Division is Busy: The investigations and disinfection carried out due to the cholera epidemic are still very busy. A total of 38,247 people were vaccinated. In addition, water disinfection, sanitation improvement work, and supervision of small restaurants are carried out. The staff is feeling inadequately allocated. In addition, several schools were inspected due to tuition fees.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Registration Forms Do Not Require Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>Different from the Nature of Invoices and Receipts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association yesterday responded to a letter from Xu Zhicheng, Director of the Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau, requesting that all doctors be informed to affix stamp duty to registration forms in accordance with money receipts. The reply to Director Xu stated: Upon receiving your letter, it is evident that your bureau is thorough in rectifying tax collection and meticulously planned, which is highly admirable. However, the purpose of establishing Chinese medicine registration forms is solely to maintain order in the clinic, ensure sequential consultations, and prevent confusion. Regarding the income from consultation fees, most clinics maintain separate books and affix stamp duty to fulfill the national tax obligations. Therefore, the nature of the registration form is entirely different from invoices and receipts, which is extremely clear. Moreover, Chinese medicine clinics employ various methods for registration forms, mostly stating the patient's name and address, and indicating whether it is a priority or regular number. Some even use bamboo tokens for simplicity. As for recording consultation fees, it is extremely rare. Not only would our association find it difficult to comply, but forcing members to affix stamp duty would only lead to disputes with your bureau. Therefore, we must truthfully respond to your bureau in order to avoid any unnecessary complications. We hope that you will consider this matter accordingly.</p>

<h3>Zhu Bohua</h3>
<p>Sued by Stepmother for Abandonment</p>
<p>Uncle of Defendant Summoned for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Zhu Songpu of Suzhou was a wealthy man during his lifetime, with assets of several hundred thousand. His first wife, Xu, bore him three sons: Bohua, Zhongfang, and Jifang. His concubine, You, bore him two daughters: Jinsen and Jinrong. In the ninth year of the Republic [1920], when Songpu fell ill, You cut flesh from her thigh to treat him. Songpu, seeing her sincerity, gave her a silver deposit book with 5,000 taels of silver under the name of Liangxinji [Conscience Record] to commend her sincerity. Soon after, Songpu died, and all of his property was managed by his eldest son, Bohua, who only gave his stepmother You 24 yuan per month for rent. At a time when the cost of living was high, this meager sum of 24 yuan was not enough to support the lives of the three women. They had no choice but to spend the 5,000 taels. Over the past decade, it has been completely used up. Last year, when Jinsen got married, Bohua gave her 6,000 yuan for dowry expenses. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, Bohua suddenly cut off the monthly 24 yuan payment. Therefore, You and Jinrong were unable to maintain their livelihood. Recently, out of desperation, You and her daughter hired two lawyers, Qin Liankui and Yao Zhaoli, to sue Zhu Bohua in the First Special Court for abandonment, requesting that he be punished in accordance with Article 310 of the Criminal Law. The indictment also accused Bohua of smoking opium. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the Second Criminal Court to summon Zhu Bohua. Zhu Bohua hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to defend him. First, Zhu You stated that she was thirty-nine years old and that Jinrong was eighteen years old. They currently reside at the Qi residence. Recently, because Bohua cut off the living expenses, they filed a criminal lawsuit requesting that he be sentenced according to the law. She also detailed the events as described above. According to the defendant Zhu Bohua's defense, You had accumulated private savings of about 20,000 yuan when his late father was alive, as well as 5,000 taels of silver that his late father had given her. Last year, he gave her another 6,000 yuan. The 6,000 yuan was not for Jinrong's dowry but was also for her living expenses. Therefore, her livelihood was sufficient to be maintained. The 24 yuan monthly payment was because she did not come to collect it, not because he intentionally did not pay it. He also presented two witnesses, his uncles Zhu Liansheng and Chunsheng. According to the testimony of the two witnesses, they had heard that she had some private savings and thought that she could maintain her livelihood. Lawyer Qin stated that Songpu had four brothers. The eldest was named Xingsheng. Since the defendant had cited his uncle as a witness, why did Xingsheng not come along? It was because Xingsheng was unusually upright and could not be used by the defendant. He requested that he be summoned to court. Judge Wu then ordered that the case be postponed and that Zhu Xingsheng be summoned to court for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Person Commits Suicide by Hanging</h3>
<p>Zhang Yihua, a young man from Ningbo, aged twenty-four, recently came to Shanghai from his hometown to seek a living. He resided in room 37 of the Changzhou First Hotel at 369 North Zhejiang Road. Due to economic hardship, he developed a pessimistic view of life and hanged himself in his room the night before last. Later, the room attendant reported it to the accounting office, who in turn notified the Huisi Police Station to send investigators. The body was taken to Tongren Hospital and then transferred to the autopsy room for examination.</p>
<p>In a certain room on the fourth floor of No. 29 Sichuan Road, a person resembling a servant, about forty years old, for unknown reasons, had a sudden suicidal thought and hanged himself in secret the night before last. It was not discovered until after 9:00 AM yesterday. Someone then called the gang police from the Fourth Road Police Station to come and take the body to Renji Hospital, and then transfer it to the autopsy room on Feilun Road, pending a court examination.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>

(2) For the period of the strike, the wages will be paid for five days per person in the iron window department and four days in the other departments. (3) On the morning of the 20th of this month, all workers will resume work. (4) The previously agreed labor-management agreement must be observed by both parties and not violated. Please publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to correct the misunderstanding. Sincerely, Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, September 21st.</p>

<h3>Selling Oneself into Servitude</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>In this world, things, though they may seem good in name, are actually of the same nature as the "cheap clearance sale" in the market. There are very many of them.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's news, the Ministry of Interior announced eight articles of the "Prohibition of Keeping Slaves and Servants." When you suddenly hear this, everyone will surely applaud in agreement. If you tilt your head and think about it, you can't help but raise many questions. The so-called "prohibition of keeping slaves and servants" is the prohibition of selling oneself into servitude. Tang Bohu in "The Trifold Marriage" sold himself into servitude. Needless to say, Wen Bizheng in "The Double Pearl Phoenix" selling himself into servitude is also an exception.</p>
<p>If they are all human beings, who would willingly be a slave or a servant? Even their parents, how could they bear to sell their beloved children into servitude, sending them to other people to be used and ordered around? There must be unavoidable difficulties involved. Since they cannot exchange children to eat or cook with their bones, they have no choice but to sell their children into servitude, sending them to wealthy families to be slaves and servants. This was originally a situation of being at the end of their rope, a desperate situation.</p>
<p>As for the system of selling oneself into servitude, although our country has this bad habit, as far as I have heard, it is not a matter of inhumanity. How to keep slaves, I have not heard of. The system of keeping maids is indeed very familiar. There are two kinds of maid-keeping: one is a "living pawn," and the other is an "absolute sale." A "living pawn" is for a period of several years, and they can be redeemed upon the expiration of the term. As for an "absolute sale," when the maid reaches a considerable age, her master will choose a spouse for her. If the master and servant get along well, they often provide a modest dowry for her and send her off to marry, still like a relative. As for the abuse of maids, committing suicide by jumping into the river, etc., although occasionally heard, it is also an exception.</p>
<p>Therefore, although our country has a system of selling oneself into servitude, it is no different from a fixed employment. Now, if we want to abolish this system, I first want to ask: How is the slave or servant's life in the family compared to their life in the master's house? The slave or servant sold themself into servitude because they could not live at home. Now, if we still want to send them back home, is this what the slave or servant wants? If we say send them to a relief home, how is the treatment in the relief home? I certainly do not know. Let me ask, can one live in a relief home permanently, and can it accommodate many people? This is also very questionable.</p>
<p>In short, if we want to solve the problem of selling oneself into servitude, we should first solve their livelihood problems. For example, the other day, the government order eliminated superstition, wanting to change the professions of several blind fortunetellers. Is that not a joke? Now, there are several college graduates with rich knowledge who still have no food to eat and no work to do. And if we want to make several blind men change their professions, is it not simply sending them to their deaths?</p>
<p>The above words are not to oppose the prohibition of keeping slaves and servants, nor to oppose the eradication of superstition. However, if we want to abolish a system, any bad system, we must first find a practical way for them to make a living before we can handle it. Otherwise, it will still be the same as a "cheap clearance sale,"有名無實 [only in name].</p>

<h3>Elegy on the National Humiliation Memorial Day</h3>

<p>If one tenth of love for the country could restore Xia, and if three households of united hatred were enough to destroy Qin, then the shocking sight of wind and cranes makes one shiver with cold. The Northeast and Southeast are like teeth and lips.</p>

<p>"Unless the Xiongnu are wiped out, there will be no peace." Looking back on the past year, I cannot help but feel ashamed. Outside the passes, the smoke of war blots out the sun, while south of the Yangtze River, the cries of wild geese fill the autumn land. Ashamed, I sit idly by while losing our land, allowing others to steal and establish an imperial state. When will the whale be reined in from the sea? When will the blue and white flag hang above the dwarf's head? (To reciprocate)</p>

<h3>Method of Imitating Kapok with Fir Trees</h3>
<p>— Jiang Tianlan</p>
<p>Kapok is very expensive. In the market, it sells for at least sixty or seventy cents per pound. If one can imitate this kapok, the resulting value is guaranteed to have special benefits.</p>
<p>Cotton is originally an organic substance. All plants containing fiber can be used to manufacture cotton, but fir trees are the best among plants because they have more fiber than other plants. If used to imitate kapok, it is an unparalleled raw material.</p>
<p>The method is to remove the bark and knots from the fir tree, finely cut the branches with machinery into thin slices, and place them in a cylindrical copper vessel 39 feet long and 13 feet in diameter. The copper vessel is pre-lined with a layer of lead and steam is passed through for about 36 hours. The wood turns white. After washing with clean water, it is crushed with a mallet and then bleached with bleaching powder. Then it is squeezed with a water press and dried to become pure fiber.</p>
<p>However, the resulting fiber lacks luster and adhesiveness. To add luster and adhesiveness, zinc green, hydrochloric acid, and acetic acid can be added and mixed into the barrel with a sufficient amount of heat. Or add some glue to make it adhesive and slightly pasty. Put it into a container and apply extremely heavy pressure to make fine threads.</p>
<p>Then, immerse these thread-like materials in a light alkaline solution to pass through a cylinder, dry with steam, and then pass through ammonia water. The fiber becomes extremely strong. Wash clean with water and dry. It can then be dyed in various colors at will. However, the fiber is not as long as natural fiber, which is the only shortcoming. However, overall, the method is not complicated and the materials are very cheap. Those who are interested in imitating this kapok may wish to do a small test to see that what I have said is not unfounded.</p>

<h3>My Views on Improving Children's Reading Materials</h3>
<p>— Cimin</p>
<p>Your publication's proposal to openly discuss such a question is truly valuable and meaningful. I cannot help but offer my blessings to the innocent and lively children. The opinions provided by Mr. Shun Chi and Ms. Shi Na on this issue are well-organized and ingenious, making me admire their efforts to create benefits for children. However, I feel that there is a need for further supplementation and explanation regarding the scope of the reading materials they discussed and Ms. Shi Na's conclusion. First, regarding the scope of children's reading materials, Mr. Shun Chi and Ms. Shi Na are caught up in the dispute over regular publications such as "Little Friends," as if there are no children's reading materials other than these regular publications, which is a big mistake. In my opinion, all books published for the purpose of providing reading to children, as long as children welcome them and are happy to read them, can be said to be children's reading materials. Therefore, regular publications such as "Little Friends" and "Elementary School Students' Series" are children's reading materials, and so are "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" and "Journey to the West" comic books. Since we are discussing the issue of improvement, we should not limit the scope to one corner. Naturally, in the eyes of general educators, things like "Conquest of the East" and "Conquest of the West" are too outdated and inappropriate, and even said to be harming and destroying children. However, can we, as adults, prohibit children from reading them? Listen, aren't children loudly shouting "After reading Tianbao’s Picture, I forgot my hunger!" Honestly, we adults do not have the qualifications to criticize the quality of children's reading materials. We should put the reading materials in front of children for testing. If "Conquest of the East" and "Conquest of the West" are welcomed by children, then in the eyes of children, they are very good reading materials. How can we subjectively and arbitrarily exclude this kind of thing from the walls of children's reading materials and not put it within the scope of discussion? Regular publications such as "Children's World" are full of bird and animal language, just like "Journey to the West," which is full of demons and ghosts. What is the difference, and where is the progress? (More details in the next section.) How can it make sense to choose one over the other when both need to be improved? Therefore, we should expand the scope of our discussion.</p>
<p>Second, are animal languages more advanced than gods and monsters? Ms. Shi Na said: "Current children's reading materials should eliminate gods and monsters and replace them with animal languages, and instill general knowledge." She also said: "Animal languages are the greatest tool for arousing reading interest and can be used to instill a large amount of common knowledge, which is what is needed in works." She further said: "Although the materials of gods and monsters mostly contain moral lessons, they are ultimately half good and half bad, and have no value for publication." It is true that the materials of gods and monsters are indeed absurd, bizarre, unrealistic, and out of touch with reality, and have no value for publication. However, how does Ms. Shi Na know that the materials of animal languages are in line with human feelings and close to reality, and stubbornly insists on eliminating gods and monsters and replacing them with animal languages? Are gods like the Monkey King, who can perform seventy-two transformations and travel 108,000 li in one somersault, really just imaginary figures? Do we really think that people like Gongye Chang, who can understand animal languages, are standing on the ground? How far apart are gods and monsters from animal languages? Moreover, gods and monsters, like the materials of animal languages, can arouse children's reading interest. Where is animal language the "greatest tool"? Furthermore, I think common sense and morality are equally important. What Ms. Shi Na said is a bit too ridiculous! How can she determine that the same kind of material that can arouse children's reading interest is needed if it instills common sense, but has no value for publication, and is half good and half bad, if it contains moral lessons?</p>
<p>My conclusion is: Current children's reading materials with animal languages are not significantly more advanced than reading materials with gods and monsters in terms of the form of material selection. Therefore, our scope of discussion should be expanded as much as possible. If we say that good children's works are those that use the form of animal languages to impart general knowledge; then good works are also those that can use the materials of gods and monsters to instill moral lessons or general knowledge. Being dissatisfied with the materials of gods and monsters is digging a grave for "animal languages."</p>

<h3>Street Drama</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>The dark side of Shanghai is truly endless. Just the deception and extortion alone have become increasingly clever and innovative, gradually becoming an art. If someone who is new to Shanghai or still has the air of a country bumpkin falls into their trap, they are in for a lot of bad luck!</p>
<p>Here, I will tell you about a street scam drama. The location is in a bustling market area, but there is not a single policeman in sight. The time is the evening of a clear autumn day. Our protagonist is a Mr. B who is full of "country" air.</p>
<p>The curtain rises. A crowd of people, men, women, people in long gowns, and people in shorts, are gathered around the high stone wall of a tightly closed iron gate. All eyes are focused on the gold watch in the hands of a middle-aged blind man surrounded by the crowd. Our young Mr. B in a long gown,一心一意, also mingled in the crowd, looking intently and calculating in his mind. The blind man cried out pitifully:</p>
<p>"Alas, I, a blind man, have a hard life! My property was destroyed by artillery fire, and my parents, brothers, and sisters died under the guns of the dwarfs. I, with my bitter fate, was also captured by the enemy and had my eyes gouged out. Although I was lucky enough not to die, how can I live from now on? This watch is the most beloved and precious thing my late father owned in his lifetime. Now, because of this extraordinary disaster, in order to continue this lingering breath, I have to bear the heart and sell it cheaply. If any benevolent gentleman has a charitable heart and saves my life, I will offer it to them for only ten yuan..."</p>
<p>This set of words made Mr. B's heart itchy. He reached out to take the watch to look at it, and his brain had already issued the order to "buy cheap goods." A pleasant shadow reflected in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Sir wants to buy the watch, I, the blind man, am extremely grateful, but please forgive me, the blind man, for not being able to see and not being able to discern people's hearts. Please let me hold onto the lapel of your clothes." This is reasonable. After Mr. B agreed, he took the watch in his palm and repeatedly examined its mechanism and quality. Just as he was about to open his mouth, suddenly, a huge hand reached out from behind the crowd, snatched the watch, and ran east. Mr. B was so anxious that fire came out of his eyes. He pushed through the crowd to chase after him, but his lapel was tightly grasped by the blind man, who cried out to Mr. B in a voice that begged:</p>
<p>"Sir, please don't make fun of me, a blind man. I, the blind man, am about to starve to death. If you don't want to buy it, please return the original watch to me."</p>
<p>During the entanglement, two men in black Xiangyun gauze short shirts and trousers appeared. They were used to meddling in other people's business and spoke to Mr. B in a tone that was like a judge delivering a verdict: "Friend, be nice. The blind man is quite pitiful. Pay up quickly. It's your own carelessness!"</p>
<p>When two five-yuan banknotes flew into the blind man's pocket, the blind man's face was full of smiles. He groped and went east. The crowd watching the commotion and the two men who looked like judges scattered with triumphant expressions and beastly smiles. Only our Mr. B, dejected and with a bitter face, returned home, trudging along with a decadent and disheartened heart.</p>
