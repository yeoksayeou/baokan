<h3 id="c1">國人對日寇熱河應有之注意華 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日人之欲吞熱河乃其［大陸政策］中預定之步驟。上月轟炸朝陽。即其對熱實力發動之先聲。當時我義軍積極進展。日人佈置尚未完備。故猝然中止。改取緩進之手段。今我義軍仍四處蠭起。消息傅來。耿王唐部屬迫近瀋陽而日軍竟冒萬險。悍然攻熱。察其内外形勢。或由二種原因。（一）蘇俄對日。近方積極備戰。日恐一旦與俄接觸。即無餘力圖熱。趁此時機。冒險攻我熱河。若僥倖而勝。便可藉此以牽制外蒙。（二）日本國内。黨争劇烈。臨時議會開會。現内閣基礎。或有動摇之可能。再度攻熱。在朝者便可假對外一致之口實。以缓和在野黨之攻擊與反對。而維持其政權。設此觀測。不遠於事實。則日本此次攻熱。實無足怪。</p>
<p>熱河之得失。關係華北之存亡。而華北之存亡。關係整個中國之安危。故熱河非東北之局部問題。乃全國安危所繫之重大問題。假使熱河不守。日本政局將因對外之勝利。暫時苟安。而其軍人之氣焰。勢必更甚其對我之侵略。將愈激進。利用滿洲傀儡僞國。犯我關内之企圖。亦必加速度進行。不甯唯是。以前淞滬之役。十九路軍及第五軍抵抗之時。世界輿論。莫不對我同情。今若放棄熱河。世界同情於我者。轉將對我失望。興愛莫能助之感。而我將益處於國際孤立寡助之地位。是以就我國内外形勢而論。熱河方面。敵人來勢。無論如何兇猛。必須竭華北乃至全國之力。以與周旋。誓死堅守。萬萬不可放棄。抑熱河在軍事上。决非不易堅守之地。其東南兩面。全是山地。日人之利器。如坦克車重砲。均難使用。即駕飛機。亦多危險。故我苟憑天險以與肉搏。彼方即以倍於我守軍之人數來攻。亦無决操勝算之把握。今彼不避艱險犯熱。正我北方健兒希敵報國最好之機會。亦即吾國軍人予日本軍閥以重大打擊之最好機會。時乎不再。機不可失。北方軍人。應有此注意與覺悟。</p>
<p>最近張學良氏告其部屬［今後國家。因禦侮有用我之處。我必捨身而出。犧牲個人身命。以報國家。］當今熱河告警之時。張氏果欲自贖其深重之罪孽。當不論其地位與名義如何。挺身而出。實踐斯言。然保守熱河。中央亦負大責任。汪之辭職。按其通電。爲反對不抵抗之張氏。中樞要人。一再挽留汪氏。足以表示贊成汪氏抵抗之主張。若目今熱河危急。不籌對策。不予有力之救援則眞挽留汪氏。可謂全無意義。我意負責要人。决不如此。</p>
<p>雖然。中央對於熱河。豈僅於軍事上應策萬全之計。即於外交上亦不可無切實之佈置。以牽制暴日侵略之激進。防其淆惑世界之宣傅。中美邦交。素稱輯睦。乃駐美顔公使久稽歐洲。僅留資望較淺之代辦於彼。即此一端。足見國難臨頭。中央尚有疏忽。其他不遑縷述。時勢危急。至於此極。徒責既往於事無補。現在凡爲國民者。惟有奮起鞭策當局。促其於各方面速施周密而有效之應急對策。恪盡保疆土衛國家之職責。</p>

<p>進行徵收紙幣税</p>
<p>銀行界籲請緩徵可允准</p>
<p>現另與各銀行恊商借欵</p>
<p>中央社云、財政部長宋子文、自偕行政院長汪精衛飛京轉潯、與國府林主席蔣軍委長等、討論汪張辭職問題、業於前日返京、并於昨晨八時二十分、偕衛生署長劉瑞恒·秘書黃純道·財部參事秦景阜等、乘坐自備塞可斯飛機由京來滬、至宋氏此次來滬任務、係與本埠銀行界接洽徵收紙幣税問題、兹將詳情分誌如次、</p>
<p>就商張壽鏞宋氏於昨晨抵滬後、即返祁齊路私邸、略事休息、九時許驅車往訪財政部顧問張壽鏞·暢談約一小時、對進行徵收全國紙幣税問題、有所商榷宋氏因鑒於滬地銀行界籲請緩徵、而財政困難、勢又非開徵不可、故以此事、就詢張氏之意見、</p>
<p>銀行界意見中央社記者、昨訪本埠銀行界某君、詢以對於財政部徵收紙幣税之意見、據談、歐美各國、對於各銀行徵收紙幣税、均有相當之規定、例如甲銀行資本若干、約發若干紙幣、如該銀行所發出之紙幣、超出規定額數、則依照所頒佈之紙幣税徵納、故於銀行界本身、不受若何影響、我國財部、於十九年八月一日所頒佈之紙幣税、并無此項税定、凡發行紙幣之銀行、不論發行紙幣數之多少、一律依照紙幣發行額十分之四之保證準備數之百分之二五紙幣税徵收、如依照該項規定、則予銀行界以重大擔負、年來國内戰事、災患頻仍、金融恐慌己臻極點、銀行界所負之擔負、實無力再加、故本埠銀行界、對於財政部徵收紙幣税、惟有竭力籲請展緩徵收、至全國純幣確數、約計三萬萬餘元、依照所頒之紙幣税率徵收、年可得三百餘萬元、外傅全國紙幣總數共有二十萬萬元、並非事實、又據銀行公會發言人、語中央社記者、關於財政部將實行徴收紙幣税事、現在不願多所主張、公會方面、己推定中國銀行張公權·交通银行盧澗泉·中南銀行胡筆江·三人、原定下午親持説帖、進謁宋部長面陳一切、但迄現在談話時、（下午四時）</p>
<p>尚未聞前往、至於説帖内容、暫時不願發表、惟銀行界實因時事多艱、無力擔負此鉅額之税收、故懇請免予徵收、</p>
<p>紙幣税意義銀行公會發言人又云、紙幣税在歐美各國、亦有實行惟其徵收者、係在超越規定之發行額以外者、即其國家銀行、並嚴守此種規例、譬如某銀行規定紙幣發行額爲一百萬如其紙幣增至百數十萬、則此超出之數十萬、將徵以百分之幾之發行税、所以節制紙幣之過量發行、並含有營業税之意義、故在銀行業其負擔亦不覺過重、</p>
<p>徵收之税率又云財政部規定之紙幣税率、爲千分之二·五（即百分之二五）而其徵收之對象、則爲紙幣發行之保證準備部份、即全额百分之四十、故以發行全額計算、其徵收之百分率爲百分之一、我國現有紙幣數額約三萬萬有餘、以百分之一計、則所擔負之税、年約三百萬、銀行同業在此不景氣狀况下、實難承荷、况財部對於外國銀行之發行紙幣、未聞有徵收之規定、此種不劃一徵收、將使本國銀行因謀减少負擔、而收縮發行外國銀行、則因有利可圖、而增加發行、其結果將使十年來國人銀行事業微細之成績、毁於一旦云、</p>
<p>總管庫難現銀行界某君又謂、今日報載南京電稱、財政部爲維持紙幣信用起見、决將各銀行之六成現金準備、組織一紙幣準備金保管總庫、銀行界對此消息、認爲謡傅、蓋各銀行發行紙幣、須有六成以上之現金準備、以維持其信用、此係各銀行各爲維持其信用、决無歸納一處之理、在事實上亦决不能辦到云、陳蔚青談話中央社記者昨日旋又往訪財政部秘書陳蔚青於中央銀行、詢以財部行將設立現金準備保管總庫説、是否確實、及徵收紙幣發行税進行之程度若何、據陳秘書談、財部行將設立現金準備保管總庫説、本人未有所聞、祇於報上見之、財部如須設立現金準備保管總庫、事實上當與銀行界於事前有所接洽、或徴詢意見、但財部與銀行界迄今尚無關於此事之接洽或微詢、故報載九月一日成立之説、當屬不確、至於財部徵收紙幣發行税、其條例早於民國十九年八月一日公布、惟迄今尚未實行耳最近財部爲防止紙幣充斥於市面計、乃决定實行徵收紙幣發行税、業己令知各銀行在案、惟目前銀行界尚在請求緩徵中云、</p>
<p>財部擬借欵金融界息、財部止次實行徵收纸幣發行税之目的在補救財政之困難、銀行界之籲請緩徵、或可邀得財部之允准、但爲解决財政上之困難、必須謀一補救之辦法、此項辦法、目前尚未確定、蓋財部方面、擬允暫緩徵收、惟須先將此項税收、提前向銀行界抵押、待他日開徵後、再扣除償還、而銀行界方面意見、則以爲紙幣發行税尚未實行徵收、當然不能抵押、如當局財政困難、可另行與各銀行恊商借欵、觀察目前之情形紙幣發行税或可暫緩徵收、財部爲補救目前財政上之困難、將另與各銀行恊商借欵云、</p>

<p>店主唯利是圖亞洲圖書公司開設在北四川路第十八號至二十號、係粤人李耀南所創辦、内部裝璜甚爲精緻、平日營業亦頗發達、惟内部文具用品、都係日商克利洋行出品且經售日貨金箭牌及拜羅自來水筆、故李己藉此獲利不少及、一二八事變、停戰恊定簽字後、李以爲機會重逢、竟又私進大批日貨文具、滿擬藉各校秋季開學之時、乘機牟利、詎竟被赤血鋤奸團偵悉、乃於二十日晚八時左右、派員持警告信一封、投達該公廬山奇案朱牛氏與人通奸弑姑殺子判處死刑奸夫無罪？</p>
<p>江西廬山之麓。有農民綽號朱小鬼者。娶本地婦人牛氏爲室。牛氏稍具姿色。自來朱家後。初尚相安。後忽厭夫貌陋。與村中王克明通奸。。發生弑殺姑子案。兹將詳情據録於下。</p>
<p>用兩手扼姑喉勒死牛氏自與王克明發生關係後。戀奸情熱。日晚留王於房中淫樂。小鬼雖有所聞。但攝婦威。且以家醜不可外揚。竟不加干涉。任所欲爲。小鬼有老母某氏。見此情狀。大不謂然。但亦未敢明白呵斥。祇以温語諷勸。詎牛氏老羞成怒。視其姑爲眼中钉。當晚竟騙其姑入房。用兩手扼其喉勒斃。時小鬼方在外賭博未回。故亦不知其中底細。聽信牛氏之言。認老母爲急病身亡。</p>
<p>小孫不平亦遭毒斃但牛氏謀姑。雖能瞞過小鬼。而其親生之長子。竟向各處宣揚其事。　與祖母伸寃。該氏恨之切骨。當晚又將</p>

<p>夥友受傷情形出事、後附近站崗華捕、即急向該管虹口捕房報告、當亟派員至出事地點查勘一過、並拾去己炸鐵片、帶回捕房留案、該受傷夥友梁廼滬、亦即由該公司自行僱車送至横浜橋福民醫院、惟傷勢甚輕、故由該院醫生將鐵片取出、敷藥包紥後、即於十時許仍回該公司、</p>
<p>日方大加注意及捕房方面查勘過後、日本陸戰隊亦得訊趕來、由軍官二名帶領衛隊直赴該公司、同時日領署亦派員到來察看情形、並臨時派日軍二名、在該公司門首站崗、不准行人在附近來往、最後日軍官等將該公司被炸情形、攝影多幀、向該公司職員訊問當時情形而云、</p>

<h3 id="c175">鎖拿年羹堯與西征隨筆 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>清初的文字獄是很慘旋的，尤其是錢塘舉人汪景祺的西征隨筆案，非但，汪氏夷滅，而且，雍正皇帝遷怒到旁的浙江舉人身上，所以雍正五年有一道諭旨：浙江士習不端，舉人停止會試。直到八年庚戌，才許浙江舉人一體會試，這件文字獄，要算辦得非常擴大的了。</p>
<p>參考雍正三年十月十七日，浙江巡撫福敏浙江將軍鄂彌逹的會銜奏摺，才知西征隨筆案發覺和鎖拿年羹堯有聯帶關係。奏摺上説</p>
<p>：：：九月二十八日申刻，欽差閑散大臣都統拉錫到杭州，齎捧上諭鎖拿年羹堯，欽此。即於是夜同都統拉錫傅喚年羹堯到臣彌逹衙門，臣敏宣讀上諭，即時鎖拿看守。：：</p>
<p>：：又臣等公同搜查年羹堯内室，併書房厨櫃内書信，並無一紙；隨將伊家人夾訊，據供年羹堯於九月十二日，將一應書札盡行燒燬等語。及問年羹堯，供詞無異。至拉錫起身之後，臣等再加細搜粗重家伙，於亂紙中得抄寫書二本，書面標題讀書堂西征隨筆：：内有自序，係汪景祺姓名：臣等細觀，其中所言，其屬悖逆。連日密訪其人，至十月十六日始知汪景祺，即錢塘縣舉人汪日祺。：：：</p>
<p>當時雍正震怒，有［妖辭二本，暫留中］，的硃批，召曰暫留，這部西征隨筆，直留到清室覆亡以後，大内書籍，流落人間，而西征隨筆也變成了一部傅書。要是，當時被年羹堯付之一炬，汪景祺的慘禍，固然是免了，這部西征隨筆早化灰燼，也不能流播人間了。</p>

<p>德國街道之整潔。夙爲世界所稱譽。</p>
<p>即素以绅士式自居之英人對之亦自愧弗如。殊不知德國街道之整潔。非特於都市間爲然。即山陵原野間。亦無不皆然而尤以風景之管理爲尤嚴。各邦政府。無不訂有專律。山陵原野之間。舉凡一切有關歷史的。與夫有關風景的各種建築物。不論其爲公有者。抑爲私有者。無論如何不論其毁損及拆除。人民之擬於。</p>
<p>山旁水畔。築屋數椽。以資春秋暇日。挈眷小住之需者。雖其地産爲私人所有。亦必先呈報山陵管理處。經該處專家。縝密研究。苟其計畫。無害於天然之風景。始得准予興工。否則雖屋己落成。亦必限令拆除之。</p>
<p>所以然者。蓋亦有故。瑞士山明水秀。</p>
<p>本有歐洲公園之目。惟自大戰以後。國際會議。悉舉行於其間。全球貴顯賁臨。鹵簿雜沓。好静之徒。羣相裏足。加以生活之昻。己倍蓗於昔而不止。於是士女遊蹤。相率北去。德人見機不可失。乃力事整頓。以吸引遊客。藉以謀貨物之推銷。都市之繁榮。凡有足以娱遊客者。罔不力行。即以廣告一事而論。亦管理綦嚴。凡屬遊客所經之處。不准設立廣告牌。因此物足以阻斷遊客之視缐。而不能盡情領略湖山景色也。我友曩曾旅德。歸而爲我言。彼曾火車行一時二十分。沿途所見之廣告牌僅十一。其面積之大。無有逾十方英尺者。而此類廣告牌之設。更不知曾納税若干。始取得管理者之許可。其管理之嚴。於此可見。</p>
<p>邇來德人更努力於以風景政策。教育全國之兒童。預料若干年後。德國之風景政策。將更有驚人之進步。不特將奪取瑞士之地位。竊恐全歐遊客。將盡被吸收以去。返觀我國之鄉村。糞穢載途。令人作噁。即以六橋三竺而言。别墅滿湖。乞丐滿山。欲求吸引游客。其可得乎。我知山靈有知。亦當愴然涙下。</p>

<p>— 白舍</p>
<p>！是奮鬥是衝鋒？</p>
<p>！中國人偉大的習性之一！</p>
<p>也許是中國人在平時修養着一種奮鬥的能耐吧？再説得切實一點，大概是隨地隨時演習衝鋒陷陣的技能吧？否則上火車，上電車，上輪船總要拼命搶個先，你搶我也搶，到後來擁成一團糟，究其竟，誰也不得先上去了呢？</p>
<p>我爲了搶前的事，曾向朋友們嘮叨了半點多鐘，結果呢？正如什麽什麽會議一樣，大家拍拍屁股而散。</p>
<p>現在我將問：［日本上次地震時是僑日的華人死得多呢還日本人死得多？］也許大家異口同聲地説：［自然日本人死得多囉，因爲僑日的華人在數字上遠不及日本當地人來得大。］可是據最可靠方面的調查的結果，却有看相反的數字，這話從那説？日本人上船的時候是排着隊，像絞盤上的繩子，是流暢而無阻。中國人呢？却是擁成一塊石餅，等一會，由石餅而變成一堆山陵，要將整個的山陵一口吞下肚去是可能的嗎？可是愈吞不下，那堆山陵的面積愈大了，組織方面也等比例的趨於嚴密而終至於結實無比，自然，一口愈吞不下了，可是愈吞不下。老子愈要你吞，這是顯得中國人的偉大。</p>
<p>如右的事實本來多到可以用列車裝，</p>
<p>但多説恐也無補於眞際，何况現在正是國難期中，這種挣扎，衝鋒陷陣的訓練也是中國人所必不可少，因此我就懶得多拖了。</p>

<p>身無彩鳳伶飛翼。心有靈犀一點通］。</p>
<p>我們從這兩句詩上可以看出古人對於鳥類的戀愛。有相當的識了。［合昏尚和時。鴛鴦不獨宿。］這是以鴛鴦爲戀愛的代表。</p>
<p>其實鳥類之有變愛。並不限於鴛鴦。鳥類的相愛。也並不單是雙飛雙宿。我現在且舉出幾種有坡的事實來。</p>
<p>（一）接吻鴿類雌雄互相接吻。時常可見。有一種鳥名呌戀愛鳥的。雌雄形影不離。兩嘴永永銜接在一起。</p>
<p>（二）歌唱我們在店舖裏買一留聲機片來。聽他唱幾句［我愛你］［我愛你］或是ＬoveＹouＬoveＹou這麽一種粗糙的歌唱。和鳥類比起來。眞是有霄壤之别了。鳥類的美音。如百靈。如黃鶑。如畫眉。凡是聽過的。莫不嘆賞不置。他們的這種歌聲。都是爲戀愛而發的。</p>
<p>（三）摩登化男女在情塲中躑躅的。衣服裝束。莫不求其［摩登化］。大概於戀愛上總有不少的帮助。至於鳥類。既無一文銅板在身。那裏來的摩登化。答曰。不然。鳥類在摩登化。是天生生的。孔雀的錦屏。翡翠的艶绿。鸚鵡的美羽。便是他們天</p>
<p>生的裝飾。</p>
<p>（四）跳舞澳洲産有一種鳥類。他們在樹蔭平地上佈置整潔的跳無塲。或是特造跳舞室。以樹枝。樹葉。鳥羽爲飾品。不過鳥類只有兩雙腿。不像人還有兩個手。所以鳥類不會什麽［却而斯頓］。華爾次］。他們的跳舞。只是張開兩翼。翩翩來往。毛羽互相摩擦著罷了。</p>

<p>— 思蘋</p>
<p>這篇關於日本於一九五年向我提出的二十一條要求的秘史是己故斐希福主教在他去世的前一年口述的。但是從未發表過。直至最近始公布於世。這篇文章對於日本外交的欺詐反覆和世界的關心中國問題很多闡明。其原文迻譯如次。</p>
<p>我自一０七年主持中國傅教事業。曾於一九一四年秋爲教務往東京。哈理斯主教問我是否願同當時日本的總理大臣大隈侯一晤。我説［這晤談是否大隈侯所授意。］他笑道［是的］。我答稱我極願同他一談。因定翌日會見。</p>
<p>大隈侯同我晤談的目的是要求我帶信給中國。呌中國不要以日軍侵略中國而宣戰或横生風波。其時日軍正在雀備從後路進攻青島。日本此舉。破壞中國主權。猶如德國破壞比利時主權一樣。晤談的時候。大隈侯説［我在首相任内。决不同中國戰］。後來他再地聲明［我在職一日。日本决不冐侵略中國之大不韙］。</p>
<p>我回到中國。並没立即向中國政府傅逹大隈侯的口信。在這當兒我思索怎樣向中國進最善的忠告。日本駐華公使日置益就在這時來看我説。他剛奉到大隈侯電令訪我。請我申述大隈同我談話的大意。</p>
<p>我以爲日置益屬於主戰派。大隈侯屬於和平派。因把大隈侯對我的諾言申説得很明白。日置益向我請教日本對華對俄對美應採怎樣正當態度。當天午後。他費了半天工夫。對此題目。提出種種問題。然後聆聽我的意見。我向他指示日本正當的政策。應與各國竭力維持和平。造成自身爲遠東以至太平洋工商業領袖。一如英國之爲大西洋工商業領袖。不應憑藉武力圖謀政治的霸種。</p>
<p>我急於往中國西部。因於三四天内就摒擋行裝。臨行。我到日本公使館向日置益辭行。並對他説。現在行色怱怱。俟明春四川歸來。再行答訪。</p>
<p>日置益過訪之後。我曾往見蔡廷幹。告訴他我來傅逹日本的口信的。至於這口信是否眞情。我不能負責。我不過像一郵差而己。我因把我同大隈侯的談話以及後來同日置益的晤見告訴他。我想蔡廷幹一定把這消息傅逹袁世凱的。後來他來同我第二次談話。蔡廷幹告訴我。袁世凱要請教我大隈侯是否能不食言。我告訴他。我想大隈侯發表這個諾言是有誠意的。在可能範圍之内。他必願意遵守信約。不過照我臆斷。他或者被迫向中國提出苛刻要求。或者不得己而辭職。</p>

<p>從九一八事變後，我方高倡其收復東北失地，但是到現在爲止，從没有看見派一失一將，將東北去收復，然而日軍閥第二步第三步的侵略計劃，一幕一幕的又表現出來了，據昨報電訊，日軍突然分兩路進攻熱河，一由義州，一由朝陽寺，以鐵甲車爲前導，向南嶺口北猛攻，並派飛機七架投彈，建築物盡被燬壞，試問軍政當局如何，</p>
<p>現雖有熱河軍董旅，拚命抵抗，下級軍官，皆怒髮衝冠，憤激欲狂，羣電湯玉麟，速下抵抗命令，但湯毫無表示，則僅僅董軍一旅之衆，如何能長久抵抗，勢必犧牲於日軍炸彈砲火下，而熱河地圖，亦將更色，試問如何，并聞日人計劃，日軍佔領熱河以後，一面與溥儀訂約，將三省割讓日本，一面進窺京津，擁護宣統復辟，即以地理言，若熱河既失，京津自不易守，，則一般辫子黨，又要入關耀武揚威，大演其［皇帝夢］之拿手好戲，試問如何，他們既做了皇帝之夢，偏安東北，組織其小朝廷，當然還不肯干休，勢必罩了日人牌頭，野心勃勃，步步進逼，而日人天然亦利用其無腦筋傀儡，一處一處開映出來，試問如何，</p>

<p>— 愼永</p>
<p>科學昌明了，人們是多麽幸福，得到了管理自然界的權柄，自從電燈泡發明之後，不是又戰勝了可怕的黑暗麽？現在電燈泡的應用己是很普遍，像上海這樣地方差不多没有人家不用了，一到夜裏，大馬路上更是照耀得如同白晝，可是要知道發明者是費了多少血汗，多少時間，因此我們不能不把牠研究一下。</p>
<p>在没有明白　構造之前，我們先應該道牠的原理，原來電流經過阻力大的金屬上就會發生熱，熱度到很高時，就發出光來。</p>
<p>因此電燈泡是一個玻璃的球，裏面有很小的金屬絲，在電流通過的時候，這金屬絲就發出光來，依照以上的原理，這金屬絲必須有三個條件：</p>
<p>第一有很大的阻力所以要用白金等阻力的金屬，而要非常細。</p>
<p>第二受了高熱度不會融化的金屬第三不會氣化的金屬。</p>
<p>因爲有這發光絲發生了許多困難，祇能用各種方法解决，所以漸漸地才有現在這種完美的結果，其中可分爲四個時期，現在且分别略加説明，就可以知道牠的構造了。</p>
<p>（一）白金時期）ＰlatinumＰerid（在這時期中，並不用玻璃泡，不過用兩根銅柱，兩端用很細的白金絲丨發光絲連起來；而後就把電流通過，白金絲發光出來就成了最初的電燈，可是這樣非常危險，因爲没有罩，就容易著火，所以第二步，在發光的白金絲外面，罩上了一個玻璃罩，用很粗的白金條接着發光絲，兩端露在罩外，以備通電，要是至今還是用這種電泡丨用價昻的白金製成的，非特不能普遍，恐怕非大富人家，誰也不敢用了，所以不久就進步到第二個時期了</p>
<p>（二）碳絲時期（ＣarbonＰerigd）用了碳絲代替了白金，價值的確便宜得多，然而有兩個先决的困難問題：第一是怎樣把碳做成細絲，第二是怎樣使碳絲不致氣化，費了許多時候的研究才有了答案，解决第一個問題，就是把竹劈成細絲，經過長時候曬和烘，到了非常乾脆的時候，把牠浸入濃硫酸裏，就變成碳絲了，解决第二個問題呢？是要把玻璃球裏的空氣完全抽出，變成眞空後，就不致氣化了，到這時候終算成功，可是試用了不久，仍不能滿意，原來碳絲太脆，又不能彎曲，因此發明者再繼續研究，不久就到了第三個時期中了。</p>
<p>（三）鎢金時期（ＴungstenＰeriod）這時候用了鎢絲做了發光絲，原來鎢的本質是粉末，而且不能凝結，到了歐洲大戰的時候，德國大科學家才發明了凝合的方法·研究電燈泡的美國科學家安迪生氏，就和他合作，把鎢金造成了發光絲·到這時那導電露在泡外的兩端還是白金·現在也改用了一種價廉的金屬（Ｉnvae)因此電燈泡己臻完美並且價值很低廉，效用很普通了，爲世界造幸福的發明者，還不知足，因爲鎢絲容易蒸發，燈泡上常有一層黑霧，久之就不能用，所以再努力，就到了第四個時期了。</p>
<p>（四）氮氣時期（MitrogenGasPeriod）這時候用氮充滿在玻琉泡中，一方面就防止鎢絲的蒸發，一方面又省了艱難的抽成眞空的手續，從此就有了現在所用的價廉耐用而又美觀的電燈泡了。</p>
<p>從上面看來，小小的電燈泡，發明的科學家是費了多少心血才造成的·並且天下有多少寳藏正要待人們去發掘出來，造成種種供人應用的，我們眞要效法安迪生去發掘寳藏，爲人類造幸福呢！</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3 id="c187">一般社會心理改良的我見 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 范式之</p>
<p>恐怕誰都這樣想吧，目前的社會，尤其是中國的社會，是惡劣的，畸形的，半封建的，不健全的，是還在舊時社會没有完全破滅，新的社會没有完全建設的過渡時期裏，惟有處於這過渡時代的人們，往往是最痛苦，最苦悶，猶如徘徊在十字街頭，不知何所適從，因之對於這現實的社會便要感到不滿足，表示不美好，覺得距離我們所理想的社會尚不可以道里計，</p>
<p>因此，本欄的［改良社會討論會］，便應時勢的需要而産生了，不過過去所己討論的，多是偏於物質方面，或外界環境的改良，而對於每個個人的一般心理的改良，少見討論，須知社會的本身，是不會百孔千瘡疾病叢生以致不可收拾的，所以弄到百孔千瘡不可收拾的，還是組成這社會的每個個人所逐漸造成的，而每個個人的所以要造成這種不良社會，還是由於他們的腦海裏有一種根深蒂固勞不可破，足以阻撓社會前進，妨碍新的社會産生的殘物，（也就是心理）潛伏着，活躍着，致使舊社會的骷髏從新抬頭，舊社會的殘物繼續滋長，新社會的建設無從開始，新社會的精神無由實現，</p>
<p>這些心理最不好的計有下面幾種，</p>
<p>（一）自私自利</p>
<p>（二）虚僞欺詐</p>
<p>（三）崇尚表面</p>
<p>（四）猜疑陰謀</p>
<p>有了自私自利的心理，便不能大公無私廉潔守法，有了虚僞欺詐的心理便不能沉着負責誠實爲人，有了崇尚表面的心理，便不能脚踏實地實事求是，有了猜疑陰謀的心理，便不能互相信仰團結一致，我們若願社會國家走上光明平坦的康莊大道，必須澈底剷除這四種舊社會所殘餘的毒物，必須澈底改良這四種舊社會所遺剩的不良心理</p>
<p>犧牲精神</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>當她的丈夫離開她的病床的時候，她那豆大的眼涙如雨點般的落下來，她的臉色由蒼白染成青灰，她以棉被埋着頭，瘦弱的雙肩不住的抽動。這使這三等病室所有的病人都爲之感動，而且十分驚訝：［爲什麽她會如此傷心的呢？］［密司黎？！］和她並排睡着的黃秋英懇切的問她説［你爲什麽這樣傷心的呢？醫生不是説你的病需要特别静養嗎？］</p>
<p>她仍是哭，而且哭得更加可憐。許久她才回過臉來向着黃秋英嗚咽的説；［我是不能超脱這苦海的，我的病是不能好的，我希望我能早些死去，這時候我覺得死對於我確有重大意義。］</p>
<p>這時她没有眼涙，更不哭泣，只有這絶望的低微的聲音。然而富有同情心黃秋英仍在輕言安慰；</p>
<p>［不過你不能這樣想，病總是診得好的，只要你能好好的休養。其實誰都會死，可是誰都不願意死，因爲死到底是十分可怕的呀。］</p>
<p>［但是，我却覺得死對於我到是十分幸福。］其後她更滔滔的説；［你知道，醫生證明我的肺病比以前更加厲害了。四個月前，我在這裏曾經住了好些時候·當醫生允許我出外調養的時候·我的朋友們都説我比未入醫院時健康得多了。自然，我需要有更好的休憩。可是我們青年人到底是容易興奮的，而且我根本就不能習慣於安静的生活。自上海戰事發生以來，我爲了每個人都應當擔負起反帝的責任，於是我便堅决的加入了看護隊。不用説，那時我是非常忙，甚至於很少睡眼，於是，我的温度增高了，由三十七度增加到三十九或四十度，當然，我的病又復發了，有時甚至咯出血來。：：朋友！你想一個人這樣的不能勞慟，那不簡直成了廢物嗎？從那時起，我便覺得我的生存眞是過於無意義了。］</p>
<p>［别説了罷，你現在休憩一下，你説話太多了。］黃秋英到底非常擔心她，現在又勸阻她了。然而她並不因她的勸阻而停止説話，她仍在繼續的往下説，而且她的聲調是如此凄凉而幽咽。</p>
<p>［我的朋友，我們雖然只有兩三個月的友誼關係，然而我却非常相信你，我覺得你是我眞正的同情者，所以我膽大的要懇求你爲我援助。我家裏還有一個兩歲不到的小孩，我是非常疼愛他的。我死後我希望你能常時去看看他，如同照管你自己的孩子一樣的去關懐他。假如死後眞的還有靈魂的話，那末我的靈魂將由於你的慈愛而得着安慰了！朋友，這是我最後的請求。]</p>
<p>［不過你爲什麽要這樣説呢？你不是説過你的丈夫很愛你以及你的小孩兒的嗎？］</p>
<p>［不，我的好友，你知道我的丈夫剛才就是來和我告别的。他己加入了ＸＸ决死團，他今晚便要出發，我想我們是不會再有機會會面了，因爲他是去肉搏衝鋒，爲民族争生存，而我又是這樣病危。不過，我的夫呀！我希望在我的死前還能夠見他一面啊！我願意有這樣的一個良好的機會。］</p>
<p>他又在哭泣了。</p>
<p>最後她還决然的説；</p>
<p>［可是，朋友！我的不幸的消息，你千萬不能當他正在殺敵的時候告訴他，因爲他過於愛我的原故，許會因此而放棄他偉大的責任的啊！］</p>
<p>其後她不再説話·目光正視正前方，完全沉浸在深沉的幻想中。</p>
<p>悲觀</p>

<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>［哭·我哭了，好久被遺棄了的無名的悲哀，輕輕的又襲上我的心；頭一陣難以消滅的暗影，像窒息着喘不過氣一樣難過，莫名其妙的悲痛，我大哭了半天，現在心頭似乎舒敵了許多：：</p>
<p>一位憂鬱的青年，那是可以從清瘦的面頰，失了神的眼珠上看出來，他咬着筆的另一端，注視窗外一株被風雨吹打得飄摇不定的小樹，</p>
<p>［可憐的小樹，你象徵着我的命運］，他嘴角微動，忍住在眼腔裏的一滴涙終於滾了下來，</p>
<p>［自從］他摇了摇頭，似乎想驅逐一切痛苦，繼續寫他的日記，［我的弟妹無故受他媽的使氣棒，他們雖然和我異母所生，但是我愛他們如生命，因爲我己是完全無靈魂的走屍了，他們丨我爸爸的骨肉，要使他們繼續我爸爸的遺志，在弱小的心靈中，怎樣可以留着這種不良的影像，我就毅然决然上我飄泊之途，天涯海角，隨處停留，維持我合家的幸福，幾年來，爸爸在天之靈像追隨着我一樣，我奮鬭，我挣扎，稍覺灰心的時候，爸爸又出現在我面前，飄泊的生涯也别有風味而富於興趣了，這一次戰争，給了我一個重大的打擊，中國人的生命財産，政府完全没有保障的能力，我幾年來慘淡經營的一個小家庭，埋葬在砲火之下了，雖然這點東西是不值人家一顧的，於我己是畢生的大損失了，我從砲火之下偷逃出來，不被人譏笑我貪生怕死嗎？但是戰死在疆塲的死後風光有什麽用呢？我可吃飯，奮鬭，挣扎：：</p>
<p>突然一陣悽凉欲絶的歌聲從兩巷中送來，他知道是一個老者和他孫女，在秋風秋雨中飄摇中，這若斷若續的歌聲，令人不忍一聽，他推開了日記簿，跳到床上，埋首在枕窩中，重復放聲大哭那可憐的小樹被秋風秋雨，吹斷了腰身，斜傾在路旁的泥水中</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Attention that Chinese People Should Give to the Japanese Bandits' Invasion of Rehe <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese ambition to swallow Rehe is a predetermined step in their [Continental Policy]. The bombing of Chaoyang last month was the prelude to their military action against Rehe. At that time, our volunteer army was making active progress, and the Japanese arrangements were not yet complete, so they suddenly stopped and adopted a gradual approach. Now, our volunteer army is still rising up everywhere. News has come that the troops under Geng Wang and Tang are approaching Shenyang, but the Japanese army is taking great risks and brazenly attacking Rehe. Examining the internal and external situation, there may be two reasons: (1) Soviet Russia has recently been actively preparing for war against Japan. Japan fears that once it comes into contact with Russia, it will have no energy to plot Rehe. Taking this opportunity, it is taking the risk of attacking our Rehe. If it wins by chance, it can use this to contain Outer Mongolia. (2) Domestically, Japan is experiencing fierce party struggles. The Provisional Parliament is in session, and the foundation of the current cabinet may be shaken. Attacking Rehe again, those in power can use the excuse of external unity to ease the attacks and opposition from the opposition party and maintain their regime. If this observation is not far from the truth, then Japan's attack on Rehe this time is not surprising.</p>
<p>The gain or loss of Rehe is related to the survival of North China, and the survival of North China is related to the safety of the entire China. Therefore, Rehe is not a local problem of the Northeast, but a major issue related to the safety of the entire country. If Rehe is not defended, the Japanese political situation will be temporarily secured due to the external victory, and the arrogance of its soldiers will inevitably be even greater, and its aggression against us will become more radical. The attempt to use the puppet state of Manchuria to invade our country will also proceed at an accelerated pace. Not only that, but during the previous Songhu Battle, when the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army resisted, world opinion sympathized with us. If we abandon Rehe now, those in the world who sympathize with us will turn to disappointment with us and a feeling of helplessness, and we will be in an increasingly isolated and helpless position in the international arena. Therefore, based on the internal and external situation of our country, no matter how fierce the enemy's attack is in Rehe, we must exhaust the strength of North China and even the entire country to deal with it. We must swear to defend it to the death and never give up. Moreover, Rehe is definitely not an easy place to defend militarily. Its southeast sides are all mountainous areas. The Japanese weapons, such as tanks and heavy artillery, are difficult to use. Even flying airplanes is dangerous. Therefore, if we rely on natural dangers to fight in close combat, even if the other side attacks with twice the number of our defending troops, it will not have the certainty of winning. Now that they are taking the risk of invading Rehe, it is the best opportunity for our northern warriors to hope to serve the country and repay the enemy, and it is also the best opportunity for our soldiers to give the Japanese warlords a major blow. The time will not come again. The opportunity must not be lost. Northern soldiers should pay attention to and be aware of this.</p>
<p>Recently, Zhang Xueliang told his subordinates: [In the future, if the country needs me to resist aggression, I will definitely sacrifice myself and my life to repay the country.] Now that Rehe is in alarm, if Zhang really wants to atone for his deep sins, he should stand up and practice what he preaches, regardless of his position or title. However, the central government also bears a great responsibility for defending Rehe. Wang's resignation, according to his telegram, was to oppose Zhang, who did not resist. The central leaders repeatedly retained Wang, which is enough to show their support for Wang's resistance. If Rehe is in danger now and no countermeasures are taken and no strong reinforcements are given, then retaining Wang can be said to be completely meaningless. I believe that the responsible leaders will never do this.</p>
<p>However, the central government should not only make perfect military plans for Rehe, but also make practical diplomatic arrangements to contain the radical aggression of the violent Japan and prevent its confusing propaganda to the world. The Sino-American friendship has always been harmonious, but Ambassador Yan to the United States has been in Europe for a long time, leaving only a junior chargé d'affaires there. This alone shows that the central government is still negligent when the country is in trouble. Other things cannot be described in detail. The situation is so critical. It is useless to blame the past. Now, all nationals can only rise up and spur the authorities to quickly implement comprehensive and effective emergency countermeasures in all aspects and fulfill their responsibilities to protect the territory and defend the country.</p>
<p>Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Japanese Army Fiercely Attacks Koubei Yingzi. Dong Futing's Brigade Blows Up a Large Iron Bridge and Defends Firmly. The Japanese Army Forcibly Occupies the Area South of Nanling on the Jin-Chao Line. Zhang Xueliang Invites Generals to Discuss Countermeasures <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Three armored trains and more than 500 soldiers from the Japanese army in Beiping rushed into Nanling Station on the evening of the 19th. After a fierce battle at night, they occupied the area and quickly captured Chaoyang Temple and Zhoujiatun. Now, they are still using armored vehicles to cover and fiercely attack Koubei Yingzi. According to yesterday's telegram, the battle was fierce, and the Japanese army did not succeed, and many died. Our army uses Koubei Yingzi as the first line of defense, Luotuo Yingzi as the second line of defense, Beipiao as the third line of defense, and Chaoyang as the fourth line of defense. Koubei Yingzi has two regiments of infantry and one regiment of cavalry under Dong's brigade, and its strength is sufficient to support it. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanjing received an official telegram tonight stating that Japanese armored trains are now attacking Rehe and have advanced to Nanling. The garrison there has retreated to Koubei Yingzi and plans to blow up the railway bridge to prevent the Japanese army from continuing to advance. (Reuters telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>A certain important person in Rehe, Beiping, said that after the Japanese army attacked Rehe once on the 18th of last month, the area south of Nanling on the Chaoyang line has been forcibly occupied by the Japanese army, and the area north is still under our jurisdiction. Last time, the Japanese side used the Ishimoto incident as an excuse to attack, still wanting to complete its railway ambitions and attempt to seize the Beipiao coal mine. The Rehe authorities, for the sake of sovereignty, did not allow it. This time, the Japanese army came to attack again, still hoping to achieve these two goals.</p>
<p>Dong Futing's brigade is stationed in the counties along the Rehe border. Yangshan, south of Chaoyang Temple, and Nanling, south of Beipiao, form a parallel and extremely dangerous area. The volunteer army led by Bi occupies a part of this area and has a great momentum. If the enemy attacks Chaoyang, Bi's troops will definitely contain its rear. Koubei Yingzi in Nanling is also quite dangerous. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Rehe Telegram Reports Military Situation at the Front <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>A special report from Beiping: Tang Yulin sent an urgent telegram reporting that the Japanese army had launched a large-scale invasion of Rehe. The original telegram roughly said: According to a report from Acting Battalion Commander Wang of the 9th Infantry Company at the front, the Japanese armored vehicles publicly set off towards our territory without notifying our side. The vehicles drove to Pomiaozi and opened fire with our side. We are now resisting. The 8th Infantry Company has been sent to the front to reinforce. A telegram was sent to inform. According to a telegram from Brigade Commander Dong, on the afternoon of the 19th, Japanese planes flew over Chaoyang and scattered leaflets, warning the volunteers to return to their hometowns quickly, etc. They circled for about 15 minutes before leaving. At 6:35 p.m., a telephone call was received from the Beipiao Inspection Office, reporting that at 9 p.m. on the 19th, a telephone call was received from the Japanese army at Chaoyang Temple, saying that the armored vehicles were heading to Nanling to contact our road protection team at the front. A telephone reply was given, instructing them not to go. They will forcibly advance. Our side is afraid that Japan has other intentions. Acting Battalion Commander Wang has ordered the 8th Company to climb the mountain to defend. The front line is properly arranged, and the road destruction tools have been transported to the front. While reporting, it was reported that our team at the front had contacted the Japanese side and requested bullets. According to a telegram from Brigade Commander Dong on the 19th, the Haohai Telephone from the 3rd Road Protection Battalion in Beipiao reported that the Japanese armored vehicles had occupied Nanling. Our team is now retreating to Koubei Yingzi to concentrate and is planning to destroy the iron bridge south of Koubei Yingzi and build a barracks in Koubei Yingzi to resist. This is the current situation reported by telegram. At the same time, it was also telegraphed that the front line troops are weak and that they should be increased from somewhere to Koubei Yingzi. However, Chaoyang is hundreds of miles away from Koubei Yingzi, and it is difficult to reinforce. If they cannot support it, what should be done? According to a telephone report from Brigade Commander Dong, during the fierce battle in Nanling, he used mortars to kill seven or eight Japanese soldiers. Zhang and Ma of the 3rd Battalion were injured. In addition to ordering Brigade Commander Dong to order the front line troops to firmly defend Koubei Yingzi and to investigate the enemy's situation in detail, if they are pressed by the enemy's superior forces, they will gather all of them in a certain place, build a defense line, and resist with all their strength. Please allocate ammunition quickly to meet the urgent needs. (Special telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>Tang Yulin of Beiping sent a telegram to Ping at 20:00, reporting that according to a telephone report from Chaoyang at 12:00 noon on the 20th, (1) Our defense line is still in the original place, and the two sides are in a stalemate. The Russian bridge north of Nanling has been blown up. (2) The Japanese armored vehicles are still in Nanling, and there is no increase in troops or subsequent troops arriving. (3) Various steps to defend Beipiao have been prepared. (4) A certain unit in Sanbaoyingzi is currently engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army in Nanling. It is hoped that the law will be quickly protected, various ammunition will be replenished, and a comprehensive countermeasure will be planned as soon as possible. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tang Yulin of Beiping telegraphed to summon Chief of Staff Li Zanting and Director of Finance Wen Zuofu to return to the province to discuss important matters. Li and Tang returned to Rehe today (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Zhang Xueliang of Beiping invited Wan Fulin, Rong Zhen, and Rehe representative Meng Zhaotian to talk this afternoon to discuss plans to deal with the Rehe border. Zhang said that he had three judgments on the Rehe issue: (1) The Japanese army used the Ishimoto incident as an excuse to attack the Rehe border volunteer army. (2) The attack on Rehe was a bluff to intimidate the interior. (3) The army advanced into Rehe in its true colors. The Rehe border is currently serious, but Tang has more than eight brigades of troops, which are sufficient to deal with it. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>The Beiping authorities are paying close attention to the Rehe issue and have reported it in detail to the central government in the name of the Military and Political Committee for instructions, and have decided to defend Rehe with all their strength. Brigade Commanders Dong Yingbin, Yu Zhaolin, and Yao Dongfan returned to their defenses yesterday and today. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Regarding the recent change of the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe, according to Wang's speech at the Central Standing Committee, the central government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have received telegrams from Beiping reporting on the Japanese army's launch and the Rehe army's resistance. The central government has decided that if the Japanese army advances, it will naturally resist. It has telegraphed Tang Yulin, ordering him to adhere to the meaning of defending the territory and resisting resolutely without hesitation. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe, the central government received urgent telegrams from Zhang Xueliang and Zhang Qun, reporting the situation of the war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also received many telegrams from Ping. Luo Wengan, due to the urgency of the Rehe issue, sent the original telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters through the Secretary of the Ministry of Justice and Administration and presented them to President Wang. At that time, the Central Talk Conference was being held. Wang presented the telegrams for discussion. As a result, in addition to ordering Tang Yulin and the generals in North China to defend the territory to the death, a telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang in Hankou to discuss everything.

<p>According to the news from Shanhaiguan, a train of Japanese troops from Jinzhou drove to the Jin-Chao line to increase defense. The situation in Koubei Yingzi is still urgent. Teams have been transferred to assist and build strong fortifications. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 21st, reporting the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe, saying that more than 300 Japanese troops from Chaoyang Temple on the Beipiao line suddenly attacked Dong Yingbin's troops stationed in Nanling between late night on the 19th and early morning on the 20th, hoping to occupy the entire Beipiao line and spy on Chaoyang. After Dong's troops bravely resisted, the large iron bridge between Nanling and Koubei Yingzi has been destroyed by our army, and the defensive fortifications are extremely strong. The troops in the Beipiao area have been ordered to concentrate their forces to resist, defend the key points, and defend firmly.</p>

<p>The spokesman of the Army Ministry in Tokyo this afternoon denied the Chinese report that the Japanese army had resumed its offensive in Rehe or was planning to carry out a large-scale invasion, saying that there was only a small conflict, the result of which was the pursuit of Rehe soldiers, and a short-term occupation of two ridges five miles northwest of Chaoyang. Before long, the Japanese army withdrew, and the Japanese army did not occupy Beipiao. The Japanese soldiers within the Rehe border are only stationed in Chaoyang Temple, a small number of garrison soldiers. However, other officials said that Japan will take vigorous action to ensure that Rehe is part of [Manchukuo]. This is only a matter of time. The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that when the autumn is clear and crisp, Japan will take resolute action in Rehe Province to end the unpleasant situation caused by Ishimoto's capture and Tang Yulin's disloyalty to [Manchukuo].

<p>Meng Zhaotian, the representative of Rehe stationed in Beiping, went to the Shuncheng Prince's Mansion this morning to visit Wan Fulin and Rong Zhen, asking for ammunition and asking them to submit it to the central government for specific assistance in order to resist for a long time.

<p>After the Japanese army occupied Nanling, people from all over formed militia one after another. The Chaoyang set up a militia headquarters to assist the army in resisting Japan. The volunteer army led by Ge Wenhua harassed the Japanese army's rear in Qilihezi and Nihezi, trying to recover Yixian and cut off the Japanese army's retreat. Until last night, our soldiers and civilians and the volunteer army united and fought a mixed battle with the Japanese army. The Japanese army could not support it and asked Jinzhou for help. A train of soldiers from Jinzhou, carrying more than 500 soldiers, went to help the Japanese army in Nanling. The Rehe authorities telegraphed Zhao Guozeng's brigade, stationed in Jianping, to rush to Chaoyang to assist. (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Central Government Has Obtained Detailed Report <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The central government has now received a detailed report on the Japanese army's re-invasion of Rehe. When the Central Talk Conference was held on the morning of the 22nd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also prepared a detailed report, which was sent to Wang Jingwei for review by Secretary Xiang Zhexun. At that time, the Talk Conference was about to end, and Wang stood up and made a brief report. According to general observations, the Japanese army's move was to threaten Tang Yulin and force him to surrender to the rebels. However, Wu Teng, who is responsible for the invasion, will arrive in Junnei soon, and it is not known whether he will carry out further aggression. At the very least, the volunteer armies in the eastern provinces will try to completely annihilate them. Therefore, the situation in the Northeast is not optimistic, but self-defense and resistance are the established policy of the central government. If the Japanese army implements an invasion, the Northeast armies will definitely be able to resist the enemy to the death under the command of the central government in order to survive.

<h3 id="e13">The War on the Rehe Border is in Progress <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The battle on the Rehe border, Beiping, is still in progress, and the result is unknown. Whether the Japanese army's move is only to rescue Ishimoto or whether it is the first step in a major attack on Rehe is a question being discussed here. The Japanese have already stated that they regard Rehe as</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Part of [Manchukuo], so it is feared that the latter is more likely. According to the official report received here, the Japanese army began to bombard the Nanling border with artillery and machine guns. Before long, the war spread to Gaobei Yingzi and Luotuo Yingzi (transliteration). There were casualties on both sides. During the battle, the Japanese army used airplanes to attack various places along the border, dropping bombs and leaflets. Several villages were destroyed by bombs, and the leaflets warned residents that anyone who joined the volunteer army would be captured and killed without mercy. Residents along the border are now fleeing into the interior one after another. Before long, Japanese planes flew over the Chinese army base in Nanling again, dropping many bombs and destroying the post office, railway station, and other buildings. The telegram also said that the two sides fought fiercely for a day and a night, and it is still not over. The outcome is undecided. Tang Yulin declared that he was determined to persevere to the end. If there was one soldier and one bullet left, he would never retreat an inch. He asked Beiping for instructions and asked to send reinforcements to resist the enemy. It is said that the generals gathered in Beiping decided to convene a special meeting to discuss the plan to defend Rehe and would send a telegram to the whole country, asking for assistance so that they could firmly resist the Japanese army. (Reuters telegram on the 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Will the Rehe Military Situation Expand? <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Beiping, various aspects investigated the Rehe military situation today and determined that the dispute on the Rehe border was only a local conflict and not the starting point of a large-scale invasion of Rehe. It is believed that any action by either side in Rehe is enough to lead to a larger-scale military situation. The Japanese army has already announced that it will not be interfered with in Rehe, and the Chinese will not make any concessions. However, foreign observers said that the current war will not expand beyond the scope of small conflicts, and this kind of small conflict has often occurred since the border incident. According to Chinese news, the Japanese army suddenly launched an attack from Chaoyang Temple and other places without warning on August 20, while Japanese news said that Tang's army shot at Japanese soldiers, so the Japanese soldiers returned fire. As a result, the Japanese army occupied Nanling Station, and the Chinese army destroyed the road track and iron bridge to prevent the Japanese army from pursuing. The general impression in Beiping is still that the roads along the Rehe border are high and must be harvested in mid-September. Before harvesting, it seems that a major war will not occur in Rehe Province. Judging from various intelligence, the Chinese troops left for southern Xinjiang in Rehe have not gone to the north of the Great Wall. Although some people are convinced that the Chinese army is determined to oppose any move to abandon Rehe Province, some believe that without major changes in the situation, this army is unlikely to enter Rehe, so it is believed that the Chinese side is taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>

<p>Nanjing Central convened a weekly memorial service at 10:00 AM on the 22nd, immediately followed by a Central Committee Conversation Meeting. The attending Central Committee members included Wu Jingheng, Tang Youren, Shi Ying, Chen Shuren, Shi Qingyang, Wang Zhaoming, Zhou Qigang, Shao Yuanchong, Gu Zhenggang, Zhou Fo Hai, Zeng Zhongming, Guo Chuntao, Li Zonghuang, Luo Jialun, Ke Xing'e, Zhang Daofan, Gong Ludong, Fang Juehui, Zhu Peide, Yu Jingtang, Chen Gongbo, Gan Naiguang, Cheng Tianfang, Zheng Zhannan, Xie Zuomin, Zhu Jia Hua, Ye Chucang, Li Ciwen, Bai Yunti, He Yaozu, Chen Lifu, Gu Mengyu, Deng Feihuang, Xiao Zhongzhen, Ju Zheng, Xiao Jishan, Chen Guofu, and thirty-seven others. The meeting was chaired by Ju Zheng, and they discussed Wang Zhaoming's request to resign from the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan. The result was that if Wang does not have time to perform his duties at the Yuan, the Vice Premier will act as his replacement, and the decision was sent to the Standing Committee for approval. The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10:15 AM on the 22nd, the Central Committee opened a conversation meeting to discuss the issue of the Premier of the Executive Yuan. Initially, they planned to hold a temporary Standing Committee meeting, but out of caution, they decided to continue with the conversation meeting to gather opinions and submit them to the Standing Committee for resolution. At the beginning of the conversation meeting, Wang Jingwei and Wu Jingheng reported on their trip to Luoyang to discuss the matter with Chairman Lin and Chairman Jiang. Many of the attending committee members expressed their desire for Comrade Wang Jingwei to continue to take responsibility. However, since Wang is a Standing Committee member of both the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Council, and everything still needs to be presided over and planned, and the two councils are the center of political strategy with heavy responsibilities, it would be difficult for him to handle the daily affairs of the Executive Yuan. However, the Executive Yuan is the executive branch for implementing policies, and the position of Premier should not be left vacant. Therefore, it was decided that Vice Premier Song Ziwen would act as the Premier, and the formal Premier would be discussed at the Third Plenary Session. According to Wang, speaking to reporters after the meeting, he will continue to be responsible at the center in the future. The true situation of the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe is not yet clear. If it is true, the central government will strictly order resistance. Wu Jingheng also said that Mr. Wang is very busy and does not have time to handle the daily affairs of the Executive Yuan, so Song will act as his replacement. The formal Premier will be discussed at the Third Plenary Session. The date of the Third Plenary Session was not discussed today, and the Rehe issue was also not discussed.

<p>At the Nanjing Central Standing Committee conversation meeting on the morning of the 22nd, Wang first reported on his trip to Luoyang, stating that he holds the position of Standing Committee member of the Political Council and bears heavy responsibilities, requesting permission to resign from the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan. Next, Wu Jingheng reported on meeting with Lin and Jiang in Luoyang, including Lin and Jiang's hope for Wang to return to his post. After discussion among the committee members, it was decided that if Wang does not have time to perform his duties at the Yuan, Vice Premier Song Ziwen will act as his replacement. This decision will be made at the Central Standing Committee meeting on Thursday. The issue of the Premier's position will still be submitted to the Third Plenary Session for decision.

<p>Nanjing, Chen Shuren stated that at the Central Conversation Meeting on the 22nd, there was a unanimous effort to retain Wang from resigning. A resolution was made during the meeting to only allow Wang to take leave during this period, and the duties of the Executive Yuan will be temporarily handled by the Vice Premier according to law. This case will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee meeting on Thursday for a concrete resolution. The Third Plenary Session is unlikely to be convened in mid-September because during the period of bandit suppression, many important Central Committee members are unable to come to Nanjing to participate, so in reality, it must be postponed. The mass resignation of the ministers of various departments was originally to express joint responsibility for advancing and retreating together, but before the new Premier is decided by the Central Government, they should continue to be responsible as usual. Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways had already submitted his resignation before Wang resigned due to the difficulty of handling affairs. This matter must also be decided by the Central Government. If Wang can withdraw his resignation and勉任鉅艱, then the ministers of the various departments under the Executive Yuan will follow Wang's transfer, and their departure or retention will no longer be a problem.

<p>Nanjing, Song Ziwen urgently needed to go to Shanghai to plan for central financial issues. He took a Sikorsky plane to Shanghai at 6:00 AM on the 21st with his secretary Huang Chundao. Regarding the Central Government's decision that the Vice Premier will act as the Premier in accordance with the law before the Premier of the Executive Yuan is resolved, Song has already agreed to it. Song is scheduled to return to Nanjing on Thursday to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting and act as chairman of the Executive Yuan meeting on Friday. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanjing, according to sources, the resolution of today's Central Standing Committee conversation meeting regarding Song acting as Premier of the Executive Yuan is that if the Premier is absent, the Vice Premier will act as his replacement as usual. Initially, Song's agreement was not sought in advance. Since Song went to Shanghai this morning, he did not attend the Standing Committee meeting. As to whether Song will take the position, various parties are still speculating. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<p>Nanjing, Wu Jingheng stated that the Wang resignation case has been decided to be temporarily shelved and will be submitted for a decision at the Third Plenary Session. The position of Premier of the Executive Yuan is currently being held by the Vice Premier. Wang continues to serve as a Standing Committee member of the Central Political Council and is responsible for the central political responsibilities. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Zeng Zhongming discussed the reason for Wang's resignation, which was due to various difficulties. He believed that it would be better to retire quietly in order to open up a new situation to remedy the current difficulties, but it was definitely not abandoning responsibility. As a Standing Committee member of the Central Political Council, he is still working hard. If the Central Government still needs him to be responsible, even if he is given the position of Minister, Wang will still take it. Regardless of the position, high or low, it is all for the country, and there is no room for refusal. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<p>Nanjing, the organizational regulations of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission have been drafted by the Military Affairs Commission and will be completed soon. It will be submitted to Chiang for review and approval, and it is expected to be reviewed and approved by the Central Political Council and the Legislative Yuan in the shortest possible time, so that it can be established as soon as possible. The scope of organization stipulated in the regulations will be larger than that of the Military Affairs Commission because although the Nanjing Military Affairs Commission is the highest military organ, there are still departments such as the Ministry of Military Affairs, the General Staff Headquarters, and the Directorate General of Training that are responsible for handling matters. In North China, all military affairs will be handled by this one branch with full authority. The number of departments and offices established by the branch will also be more than that of the Military Affairs Commission.

<p>Beiping, Zhang Xueliang will move to the Summer Palace with his family at the beginning of this week. Although Zhang agreed to Chiang's request to stay in Peiping, it is said that he is still determined to withdraw from the military and political circles and has resigned from the new position of the Military Affairs Commission. Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission is afraid that he will not be able to come to Peiping to attend the opening ceremony of the Military Affairs Commission, and it is likely that Jiang Bocheng will be the substitute. Zhang addressed the generals who telegraphed to retain him, advising them not to take any further action, as it would only complicate the situation and cause misunderstandings among the public. It is said that the radical elements among the generals demanded that all the letters and telegrams between Zhang and Nanjing from the September 18th Incident to the retreat from Jinzhou be published, along with a statement of the background of the recent incident, in order to show who is responsible. Zhang advised them not to be reckless, so as not to make it difficult for him and endanger the overall situation. He then ordered them to return to their original defenses.

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams: Contents of Various Agreements of the British Imperial Economic Conference</p>
<p>Imperial Goods Continue to Enter Britain Duty-Free</p>
<p>The Two Agreements Between Britain and Canada and Britain and Fiji are the Most Important</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 21st: The various agreements signed at the Imperial Economic Conference roughly stipulate that imperial goods currently entering Britain duty-free will continue to be exempt from taxes after November 15, 1932, with some exceptions. The British government will maintain the current tariffs levied on foreign goods based on value, which cannot be reduced without the consent of several autonomous governments. The most important are the two agreements between Britain and Canada and Britain and Fiji, which stipulate that if imperial producers cannot or are unwilling to supply Britain's needs at prices not exceeding the world market price, Britain may waive tariffs on certain foreign goods. The British-Canadian agreement states that Canada can only impose protective tariffs on industries in which it has a definite chance of success, in order to limit the import of British products. Canada undertakes to establish a tariff commission, and allows British producers full power to speak to the commission. Canada also agrees to immediately abolish various existing surcharges on imported British goods when its financial situation permits. The agreement is valid for five years, and the agreement is accompanied by various forms detailing the amount of preferential treatment obtained by Canada. One form, to be published, contains 220 items, detailing Canada's preferential measures for Britain. The new preferential treatment for British textiles mainly refers to linen and cotton goods, as well as major categories of wool goods. The British-Canadian agreement continues the method of duty-free import of Canadian milk products into Britain for a period of three years, but if the interests of British manufacturers require taxation, the British government may levy taxes. The British government undertakes to levy taxes on the following goods: foreign wheat, one shilling per quarter; milk, fifteen shillings per hundredweight; butter, 15% ad valorem; apples, four shillings and six pence per hundredweight; canned apples, three shillings and six pence per hundredweight, plus sugar tax; raw eggs, one shilling to one shilling and nine pence per hundred; blister copper, two pence per pound. The British government also undertakes not to reduce the 10% ad valorem tariff on lumber, fish, asbestos, and lead without first obtaining Canada's consent. If imperial producers cannot or are unwilling to sell wheat, blister copper, and lead to Britain first at prices not exceeding the world market price and in sufficient quantities, the taxes can be revoked. A maximum of 2.296 million pounds of Canadian bacon and ham can enter Britain duty-free. Furthermore, the existing preferential measures for Canadian tobacco will continue for 15 years. The list of British-Canadian duty-free goods, which has not yet been announced, contains 220 types of goods, covering a wide range. Many items that previously required taxes are now duty-free. The informal understanding between the iron and steel industries will be the basis for tariff revisions. Canada undertakes to adopt tariffs based on the principle of protection, so that British producers have full parliamentary access to appropriate competition based on the relative costs of economic and efficient production. Article 21 of the British-Canadian agreement stipulates that if Britain and Canada believe that foreign actions may undermine the preferential treatment between Britain and Canada on a certain item, Britain and Canada may prohibit the import of such goods into Britain. The agreement between Britain and South Africa guarantees that South African goods continue to enter Britain duty-free. Although Britain allows South African milk shed products to be imported duty-free for three years, it still reserves the right to levy preferential taxes on South African products or limit their quantity for the sake of British producers' interests. Britain will propose tariff bills to levy taxes on foreign oranges, peaches, grapes, and other fruits that can compete with South African products, and to levy a 10% ad valorem tax on white corn and two pence per pound on blister copper. Britain will levy a preferential tax of two shillings per gallon on certain South African wines. Britain undertakes not to reduce the 10% ad valorem tax on certain foreign goods that compete with South African goods. Britain also allows South Africa's existing preferential treatment for tobacco to continue for ten years. South Africa will propose legislation to seek preferential treatment for certain British goods. The British-Fijian agreement is valid for five years and can be terminated with six months' notice upon expiration. The British-Rhodesian agreement allows Rhodesian goods to be imported into Britain duty-free with reservations. Eggs, chicken, milk, oil, and butter can still enter the country duty-free within three years. Britain reserves the right to reconsider and may notify the Rhodesian government to levy preferential taxes or reduce their quantity. Rhodesian tobacco will still enjoy preferential treatment, with taxes not exceeding two shillings and half a penny per pound. Britain agrees to sponsor the promotion of Rhodesian tobacco. The agreements between Britain and Australia and New Zealand stipulate that the wholesale price of frozen meat in Britain will be increased, as the current price is too low, which greatly affects the livestock industry in Britain and the autonomous territories. The British government's meat policy is primarily aimed at promoting domestic production, followed by expanding the opportunities for autonomous territories to import meat into Britain. Australia agrees to limit its exports of frozen lamb to Britain in 1933, with the amount limited to half of the imports before the end of June 1932. Britain also agrees to restrict the import of foreign meat.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: This morning, newspapers commented on the agreements signed at the Ottawa Economic Conference, with the tone varying depending on the party affiliation. Editorials in Conservative newspapers still praised the achievements of the conference, and echoed Baldwin's saying that a new era has begun in imperial trade, and that the agreement can prevent the trend of economic nationalization. Liberal and Labor newspapers still opposed the results of the conference, pointing out that it only made food more expensive. Opposition newspapers did not believe that overseas autonomous territories' tariff commissions could give British products fair treatment.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 22nd: The Ottawa agreement cannot take effect until it has been approved by Parliament. However, both houses of the British Parliament are currently on vacation and will not meet until October 27. The political world hopes that Parliament will discuss the agreements signed at the Imperial Conference as soon as possible, so it is not impossible to slightly shorten the parliamentary recess. The Canadian House of Commons is scheduled to meet on October 15 to discuss the new British-Canadian trade agreement. If no unexpected events occur, both houses of the British Parliament may convene at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e61">US Election Campaign <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Focus of the Two Parties' Debate</p>
<p>Is the Issue of Economic Recovery</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st: The presidential election campaign is now in full swing. The two most important points for both parties are economic recovery and prohibition. Now, they are focusing on the issue of economic recovery. The Democratic Party is making every effort to criticize President Hoover for being indecisive in dealing with the economic downturn, making major mistakes, and favoring the wealthy and powerful. The Republican Party is spreading rumors that the Democratic presidential candidate, Roosevelt, is a weak, frivolous, and extremely biased person, and that the vice presidential candidate, Garner, is an unreliable and dangerous figure. They are attacking each other without sparing any effort. As for the issue of prohibition, both parties are now quietly wooing organized groups. Some prohibition associations now want to support President Hoover, while some anti-prohibition associations are willing to support Roosevelt. Opinions are divided and very inconsistent. It is difficult to predict how the vote will change in the future.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Manila, 22nd: Philippine Governor Roosevelt has decided to depart for the United States on September 14 to participate in the presidential campaign against President Hoover. The ship that Roosevelt will take is the President Grant. Mrs. Roosevelt will remain here and will not travel with him. Roosevelt's return to the Philippines will be after the end of the election, around early December.</p>
<h3 id="e62">US Senator Borah Advocates Increasing Currency Circulation <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>To Alleviate Difficulties in the Economic World</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 21st: US Senator Borah stated today that if the United States wants to avoid economic chaos and disaster, it should increase its currency circulation. His theory is virtually the same as the late Mr. Bai Yang's free silver coinage plan. Borah believes that the issuance of $1 billion in banknotes stipulated in the House Loan Bank Act is the beginning of the restoration of the gold standard, but this is only the beginning, and more can be issued in the future without endangering the national finances. The so-called gold standard means that one gold dollar can still only purchase the same amount of goods as under the old agreement. In other words, the value of the gold dollar has a certain ratio to the average price of goods. Conforming to this ratio is called the gold standard, so the gold standard is a stable gold dollar price. After being used as a unit of account in contracts, its value will not change no matter how much time passes. Currently, if the US economic world does not have a bold plan to restore prices to the 1926 level, its future will only be chaos and disaster, because under the current situation and plans, we will be unable to repay a large portion of our debts. Now, the House Loan Bank Act allows the issuance of US$1 billion, and US government bonds also have circulation rights. In his judgment, this increase in currency circulation will greatly help alleviate the current economic difficulties, but this move can only be regarded as the beginning of what we want to achieve.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Zagreb, 21st: The Round-Europe Air Race has now become a contest between Italian and German aviators. Italian aviator Colombo first arrived in Zagreb in the first leg, passing through Berlin, Prague, and Vienna. He was closely followed by three German aircraft, piloted by German aviators Mailingfeldt, Stein, and Meisenbach. The Italian aviator arrived here at 4:40 PM, and the three German aircraft arrived in succession within half an hour. Most of the remaining aircraft were still between Krakow and Zagreb. Only two French aircraft had not yet passed Krakow. Furthermore, German aviator Klamon and Italian aviator Donatti were forced to land midway due to engine trouble. Donatti landed in Poznan, and Italian aircraft repair personnel have flown to assist so that Donatti can continue his journey after repairs. German aviator Motschek, who won the championship in the previous two races, also arrived here, ranking twelfth, but his prospects are still good. After a short rest, the pilots set off for Postumia, Italy. It is now reported that the two German aircraft piloted by Stein and Meisenbach have overtaken the Italian aircraft piloted by Colombo.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Fiume, 21st: A telegram from Postumia, located on the border between Italy and Yugoslavia, states that German aviator Mailingfeldt was the first to arrive there. German aviators Stettmann and Meisenbach and Italian aviator Colombo followed closely behind. Twenty more aircraft have now flown past Vienna, and most of the others will spend the night in Vienna. So far, only one accident has occurred: a wing of the Swiss aircraft piloted by German aviator Straumann suddenly came loose midway. The pilot was quite anxious for a moment, but he safely landed in Vienna with a parachute. Straumann has now decided not to continue the race.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 22nd: Several aircraft participating in the Round-Europe Air Race arrived near Rome this morning, completing the race at the Litoriou airfield. In the first leg, German aviator Stettmann was the first to fly in, arriving before 8:00 AM. German aviator Mailingfeldt and Italian aviator Colombo also arrived one after another. A few minutes later, two more German aircraft arrived, piloted by Meisenbach and Lusso. Before noon, six more aircraft arrived, including three German aircraft, two Italian aircraft, and one Swiss aircraft.</p>

<h3 id="e74">American Professor Reveals Japanese Conspiracy <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Japan Considers the US its Primary Enemy, Followed by Russia</p>
<p>Seizing Manchuria with the Japan-France Agreement as Backup</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun published a lengthy article on the 18th entitled [American Views on Japan]. The article provides insight into the psychology of the Japanese and American peoples. A translation is provided below. Recently, the Hearst newspapers in the United States have often made statements expressing fear of Japan. However, the malicious words and wanton attacks on Japan by these newspapers are not surprising. However, the fact that a certain individual who has resided in Japan for seven years, is familiar with the situation in Japan, and is a professor at a Japanese high school has also made such statements is indeed worthy of our attention. His words are: We should know the situation in Japan today and the psychology of the Japanese towards the United States. The negative feelings of the Japanese towards the United States are deeply ingrained, and the reason for this is that after President Roosevelt acted as a mediator at the end of the Russo-Japanese War, Japan could not seize Manchuria and could not obtain compensation from Russia. As a result, it only obtained the southern half of Sakhalin Island. This was the beginning of the Japanese hating the United States. After that, the passage of anti-Japanese laws in California, opposition to the Twenty-One Demands, and other events followed one after another. During the European War, the United States prevented Japan's Siberian expedition from advancing east of Lake Baikal. Last year, the Manchurian Incident suddenly broke out, and the United States intervened again. As a result, Japan was repeatedly constrained by the United States and could not achieve what it wanted. The Japanese have long known that a war between Japan and the United States is difficult to avoid, but it is only a matter of time. Since the enactment of the Asian Exclusion Act in 1923, the Japanese Navy has been preparing for battle. At that time, Japan's will to fight was extremely strong, but the Great Kanto Earthquake occurred, and the idea of fighting disappeared. After the Manchurian Incident broke out this time, the United States did not change its long-standing policy and interfered. As a result, the image of the United States in the minds of the Japanese became increasingly recognized as an obstructer, a hypocritical gentleman, a cold-blooded man (as before, when the United States excluded the Asian race, Japan condemned the United States as a hypocritical gentleman, prevented Japan's inevitable territorial expansion, and condemned the United States as a cold-blooded man, and in all other actions of the United States against Japan, it was always made difficult). However, the proponents of war in Japan were not only the military, but also the entire pro-war nation. These pro-war citizens incited the military to go to war with the United States. For example, in Osaka, the wife of an officer committed suicide to persuade her husband to cut off his concerns so that her husband could serve the country wholeheartedly. This kind of fact is carried out among the people and praised by the government and army officers. Therefore, Japan believes that with this indomitable spirit, martial spirit, and national unity, it can be assured of victory in a war with the United States. It has also said that Japan's naval power is quite dominant among the countries of the world today. Holding such an exaggerated idea to confront the United States, it usually refers to the United States as its primary enemy, followed by Russia. However, although Japan boasts that it can be assured of victory, what it fears is the US Air Force. Therefore, recently, major Japanese cities have been urgently practicing air warfare. However, Japan's aviation technology is quite immature, and Japan also knows that it is not a match for the United States. Therefore, at the recent Geneva Disarmament Conference, it proposed the abolition of aircraft carriers. At that time, when we heard that Japan was proposing this plan, we could not help but laugh, because its fear had been publicly exposed. The outbreak of the September 18th Incident last year was caused by the Japanese military itself destroying the South Manchuria Railway. This has already been mentioned in the Tanaka Memorial. As far as we are concerned, although the Japanese government officially denies it, its ambition to conquer the world is undoubtedly clear. The invasion of Manchuria is a prerequisite for realizing its ambition. After Manchuria is obtained, it can obtain endless resources such as gold, coal, and forests. Not only can it surpass the United States, but it can also increase its wealth by more than three times. What is most noteworthy among them is the Japan-France secret agreement. This agreement was concluded after the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. France allowed Japan to send troops to Siberia and recognized its seizure of the land east of Lake Baikal. The reason why Japan dared to seize Manchuria was that it had this agreement as its backing. Therefore, France is nothing less than a Japanese lantern leader. This view is also known to all countries in the world, so there is no need to avoid it. (The following is omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Recent Political Situation in North China <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Has Cancelled His Intention to Go Abroad</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong is Scheduled to Arrive in Tianjin Next Week to Take Office</p>
<p>Internal Unity, Local Security as Usual</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since President Wang Jingwei submitted his resignation to the Central Government, Zhang Xueliang, Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters, had no choice but to resolutely resign due to environmental reasons, so as to avoid being criticized by all parties. Although more than 50 generals in North China, such as Song Zheyuan, Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezhong, Wang Shuchang, and Tang Yulin, jointly telegraphed the day before yesterday, stating that they would advance and retreat with Zhang, the actual situation is not serious. The generals have followed Zhang's father and son for many years and have been through thick and thin together. On weekdays, Zhang's subordinates are also very harmonious in terms of feelings. This time, Zhang's departure must be expressed in order to comfort Zhang's heart. This is one reason. Furthermore, the generals in North China, witnessing the three northeastern provinces being seized by the violent Japanese and unable to recover the lost territory, should also understand the overall situation, unite internally, and wait for the day to plan a permanent anti-Japanese plan. They definitely do not want to cause unrest in the political situation in North China due to Zhang's personal resignation. This is the second reason. With these two reasons, after the telegram was issued, once Zhang personally comforted and exhorted the generals separately, urging them not to have any excessive remarks, it would be safe and sound. As for whether Zhang will go abroad or stay in Peiping to continue to be responsible for military and political affairs in North China, the reporter was told by Provincial Chairman Wang Shuchang yesterday that it has not yet been decided. However, according to general speculation, there are many problems hindering Zhang's going abroad, so it seems more likely that he will stay in Peiping, or he may still serve as the chairman of the Military Affairs Committee branch. It is also unknown. Because of Zhang Xueliang's resignation, the issue of the change of chairman of Hebei Province has been triggered. This has been decided by the northern authorities and telegraphed to the National Government for appointment. The National Government has now issued an order transferring Yu Xuezhong to be the chairman of Hebei Province, and Wang Shuchang to be the commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison. The military positions held by Yu and Wang will remain the same. After Chairman Wang returned to Tianjin from Peiping yesterday, he immediately instructed the departments to handle the handover matters, and convened his subordinates to give a speech in the provincial government, the general idea being that everyone should not lose heart because of his personal departure, and should still assist the new Chairman Yu in handling affairs with the same spirit as before. As for the department heads and provincial committee members under the jurisdiction of the provincial government, there was also news of a general resignation the day before yesterday due to Chairman Wang's transfer, but after Wang's persuasion yesterday, the intention of general resignation has been cancelled. However, the positions of the heads of the finance and civil affairs departments are important, and it has been widely reported here that they will be replaced. The most promising candidate for the head of finance is Zhang Zhenlu, the former head of the Liaoning Finance Department. Although the position of the head of civil affairs is rumored to be unstable, there is still some chance of being reappointed. Mayor Zhou Longguang is still suitable for dealing with Japanese diplomacy, and is expected to continue in office based on the current situation. According to this political development, local security has not been affected in the slightest. This is also because the military and political authorities are well aware of the overall situation and do not want to give the Japanese an opportunity to take advantage of. It is heard that the new chairman, Yu Xuezhong, has decided to come to Tianjin to take office next Tuesday or Wednesday. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Expanding Air Force in Guizhou and Guangdong <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Guizhou Aviation Bureau Hires American-Trained Pilots as Instructors</p>
<p>Guangdong Continues Promoting Aviation Bonds for New Fighters</p>
<p>Guangzhou Report: The provinces of Guizhou and Guangdong have recently been making great efforts to expand their air forces. In Guizhou, after Bai Chongxi and Li Zongren returned to Guizhou the year before last, they immediately set their minds to establishing an aviation bureau to build up air power. However, at that time, Guizhou lacked aviation talent and had to borrow personnel from Guangdong. When Li Zongren came to Guangzhou to participate in the Southwest National Government, he discussed with the Guangdong Air Force Headquarters about allocating a group of flight personnel to Guizhou to establish an aviation bureau. Zhang Huichang then sent Ao Yuanqing, He Jingwei, Liang Qingquan, Yu Bingyang, Huang Yihe, Deng Xianggang, Yuan Jiaqi, Chen Qiguang, Li Lingyun, Zhou Yiping, Zhang Jian, Huang Fengming, Liu Guoquan, Huang Yuanbo, and more than a dozen others to serve in the Guizhou Aviation Bureau. Lin Weicheng, the former advisor to the Fourth Group Army of Guizhou Province (also from the Guangdong Air Force and formerly the Director of the Guangdong Aviation Bureau), was appointed as the Deputy Director. The bureau's internal organization was divided into a training section, with chief and deputy flight instructors, chief and deputy mechanical instructors, a chief mechanic, senior and junior instructors, all of whom were assigned to the above-mentioned personnel. Since its establishment in Nanning, the bureau has graduated aviation and mechanical classes, each with thirty students. Unexpectedly, the Guizhou authorities, for some reason, suddenly dismissed all the aviation officers who had been introduced by Zhang Huichang of Guangdong to serve in Guizhou this month, paying them half a month's salary and sending them away. This group of Guangdong pilots returned to Guangdong on the 9th. After the dismissal of these personnel, it is rumored that Deng Yueming and Yang Guanyu, who had previously been dismissed from their posts in Guangdong and were staying in Hong Kong, would be hired to serve in Guizhou. However, this has not yet been implemented. If the Guizhou Bureau had not dismissed the Guizhou Aviation Bureau personnel due to political reasons, there would have been no reason to recruit Deng and Yang, who were close to Zhang Huichang, from Hong Kong. Now, considering that Li Zongren has recently hired American-trained aviation personnel returning from the United States to Guizhou, it is possible that the dismissal of all personnel from the Guizhou Aviation Bureau had a political purpose. It is reported that the three American students recently hired by Li Zongren in Hong Kong, Zhang Haoyuan, Wang Demin, and Wu Yaosong, were hired to go to Nanning to serve as flight instructors in the Aviation Bureau. As for the Guangdong Aviation Department, since Zhang Huichang's faction lost power, Huang Guangrui is now reorganizing everything. Recently, there has been news of the expansion of one more squadron. There were only five squadrons, and now it is planned to form a sixth squadron. During Zhang Huichang's tenure, he purchased a batch of fighter planes from a certain country. After Zhang's departure, the purchase contract was taken away by Zhang, so when the planes arrived in Hong Kong, Zhang and the Guangdong government argued over who would take delivery. The Guangdong government had the funds but not the contract, while Zhang held the contract but lacked the funds to take delivery. The two sides were in a long legal battle. Guangdong sent Zhu Zhaoxin to Hong Kong to negotiate using diplomatic means and prepared a large sum of money to purchase the planes. As a result, Zhang Huichang's side failed, and the planes that were shipped were taken over by the Guangdong government. They arrived in Guangzhou yesterday. It is said that these planes are new [Douglas] fighter planes, with machine guns placed in the front, back, left, and right, and a very high flight speed. Five planes have already arrived and have been received by the Air Force Headquarters. The Air Force Headquarters yesterday appointed Hu Jinya (the former commander of the First Aircraft Squadron), who had just returned from the United States to raise funds, as the Air Force Chief of Staff. Hu took office yesterday, the 15th. The government advocates continuing to promote the aviation bonds previously issued by the Air Force to purchase more planes. Chen Jitang has ordered that 3 million be sold within a limited time, with 1.5 million to be sold in Guangzhou and the remaining 1.5 million to be sold in various counties and cities throughout Guangdong Province, with specific sales quotas. Shantou, Nanhai, and Zhongshan are each assigned 200,000, Dongguan, Shunde, and Xinhui are each assigned 150,000, Chao'an, Jieyang, Chaoyang, and Chenghai are each assigned 120,000. The largest quota is for Taishan, which is assigned 250,000. The remaining counties, with quotas of tens of thousands or thousands, are assigned specific quotas for selling bonds and remitting funds.

<h3 id="e77">Fujian Army Begins Troop Movements <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>剿匪 Campaign About to Launch</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondent: The various army units of Fujian Province and the 19th Route Army are now carrying out troop movements in sequence. The city of Fuzhou and its surrounding suburbs are to be guarded by the Supplementary Brigade of the 19th Route Army, under Tan Qixiu. The 1st Marine Brigade, under Liu Gangde, which was originally stationed in the Qiaonan district of the city, has moved to the southern countryside. The Engineer Battalion of the 56th Division, which was stationed in the Qiaobei district, has moved to the western countryside. The 2nd Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, under Chen Qixuan, which was stationed in the urban area, has moved to the northern countryside. The troop movements have been underway for several days. As for the defense of southern Fujian, the 1st Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, under Chen Guohui, also began to withdraw from Huian, Nan'an, and Anxi on the previous day, in accordance with orders, to be replaced by the Mao Weishou Division of the 19th Route Army, and moved into Yongchun, Dehua, and Datian. However, the people of these three counties, in view of the illegal activities of the Chen Brigade in the Quanzhou area, strongly opposed it, and sent telegrams to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Provincial Government, and the Headquarters of the 19th Route Army, refusing the entry of the Chen Brigade. At the same time, the people of the Xianyou and Tian counties, because the deputy brigade commander of the 3rd Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, He Xianzhu, forced the planting of opium seedlings and extorted military pay, amounting to 5 million yuan in just three years, which the people could not bear, also suddenly launched an anti-He movement. Representatives were elected by various groups to come to the province to organize a Save-Our-Homeland Association, demanding that the Pacification Commissioner's Office investigate He and send the 19th Route Army to take over the defense. The storm is quite intense.</p>
<p>After the 60th Division of the 19th Route Army, under Shen Guanghan, and the 78th Division, under Qu Qingnian, were stationed in Longyan and Yongding counties, the overall offensive was temporarily postponed because the armies of Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces had not yet arrived at the agreed locations. First, scattered bandits in the rear were searched for, and economic blockade was strictly enforced, causing panic in the bandit areas. Now, Commander-in-Chief Cai Tingkai, having received a telegram from Military Affairs Committee Chairman Jiang, instructed the Shen and Qu divisions to actively advance towards their destinations and change their previous guerrilla tactics. After receiving the order, Cai ordered the Shen Division to advance towards Changting from Shizhong, and the Qu Division to advance towards Changting from Kanshi, in preparation for the overall offensive. At the same time, he telegraphed the Guangdong forces stationed in Shanghang and Wuping counties, requesting them to postpone their withdrawal so that the army could concentrate its forces for battle. Yesterday, he received a reply telegram from Chen Jitang, approving the retention of Yan Yingyu's brigade in Wuping and Zhong Shaokui's unit in Shanghang to assist in defense. Also, the 19th Route Army's military pay, which was originally allocated 300,000 yuan per month by the Central Government and 200,000 yuan per month by Guangdong, has been specially approved by the Central Government to increase by 200,000 yuan per month, starting in August, and by Guangdong to increase by 100,000 yuan, for application, but all for a limited period of three months.

<p>A Glimpse of the Stele Forest On the afternoon of the 14th, we made a brief visit to the Stele Forest, a historically famous site in Xi'an. Upon entering, we saw steles everywhere, a dazzling array that made us reluctant to leave. Among the many steles, the Sacred Teaching Preface Stele, the Nestorian Stele, the Yan Family Temple Stele, and the Thirteen Classics Stele were particularly well-known. According to our guide, there are about 2,000 steles, divided into more than 440 types. A full set of the Thirteen Classics Stele sells for 85 yuan. The stones, totaling two hundred forty-five, with over one hundred seventy补 stones, are each about six尺 tall and two尺 six寸 wide, contains about three thousand six hundred and fifty-six characters, and sells for about thirty-five yuan. We contemplated them for a long time, but ultimately decided that this matter was outside the scope of our investigation and we could not devote enough time to its study. We then visited the Confucius Temple, inspected the ancient sacrificial vessels such as 籩豆 housed there, and returned.</p>
<p>Approaching Our Destination That evening, Provincial Government members and directors Zhao Shouyu, Li Bailing, Han Guangqi, Li Zhigang, Li Xie, Yu Jun, and others hosted a banquet for all of us at the Northwest Hotel. This was our only banquet together. Tomorrow morning, the members of our North and South groups would head to their respective destinations. The North Group's scope of investigation included sixteen counties: Sanyuan, Yao County, Tongguan, Yijun, Zhongbu, Luochuan, Kuang County, Ganquan, Fushi, Yanchang, Yichuan, Jiyi Town, Longmen, Hancheng, Lin Yang, and Dali. The South Group's scope of investigation included nineteen counties: Qinling, Xiaoyi, Zhen'an, Ankang, Hanyin, Shiquan, Xixiang, Chenggu, Hanzhong, Mian County, Baozhong, Liuba, Miaotaizi, Feng County, Jianchawei, Baoji, Fengxiang, Wugong, and Xingping. The route seemed longer for the South Group, but the scenery along the way was better, and there were many more famous scenic spots and historical sites. The North Group's investigation period was five days shorter than the South Group's, but the journey would be more arduous.</p>
<p>For the convenience of work, each group was further divided into eight subgroups: agriculture and forestry, mining, industry and commerce, water conservancy, transportation, economy, special products, and education. On the North Group side, Li Yongzhen, Sun Zhongyi, and Gu Zhizhong joined the agriculture and forestry group; Huang Bokui, Hu Boyuan, Ma Jin, and Feng Jinglan joined the mining group; Yu Qianliu, Xu Nanchou, and Zhu Ruijie joined the water conservancy group; Liu Binglun and Hua Chenghou joined the transportation group; Xu Yihe and Bian Wenjian joined the economy group; Yan Wei joined the special products group; and Gu Zhizhong and Zhang Mofu joined the education group. The South Group's arrangements were not yet finalized as of this writing. According to the director's announcement, we would get up at 7:00 AM on the 15th, have breakfast at 8:00 AM, and set off at 9:00 AM, and depart at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>On the 15th, we got up at 6:00 AM, and by 7:00 AM, the sound of people was everywhere. Three hours later, the North Group would set off for Sanyuan, and the South Group would set off for Qinling. According to Zhao Shouyu, the places we had passed through before were mostly paradise, but from here on, we would be heading towards hell. But what the taste of hell is like, listen to the next installment.</p>
<p>Also, since the reporter has joined the North Group, aside from entrusting someone to write reports on the South Group, all correspondence will be limited to the North Group. As for the omissions regarding the various situations in Xi'an, I plan to supplement them upon my return. (Sent from Xi'an at 8:00 AM on August 15)</p>

<p>Cao Regiment Transferred to Siyang to Suppress Bandits Cao Pang, the commander of the 2nd Security Regiment of Jiangsu Province, has been stationed in Songjiang for two years. He has rectified his troops and eliminated the gangs in Pudong, and is well-loved by the local people. During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai this year, Commander Cao spared no effort in maintaining local order, sending troops to build roads. The people were able to live in peace. It is learned that the province has ordered him to transfer to Siyang to suppress bandits. Various organizations and district chiefs in the county have sent telegrams to the Provincial Security Department, pleading for him to stay, but have not been successful. In addition to ordering his troops to prepare for departure, Commander Cao will retain several companies in Songjiang to console the people. He has also scheduled a farewell gathering at the auditorium of the People's Education Center on the 23rd, inviting people from all walks of life to attend and bid farewell. Various local organizations have been hosting banquets for several days to express their farewell sentiments.</p>

<p>Police Squad Vigorously Suppresses Lake Bandits On the 27th of the previous month, a large group of Pudong gang bandits suddenly arrived at Chenmu Longting Town in Suzhou, kidnapping seven villagers: Shen Changbao, Shen A'san, Shen A'xi, Zhang Erbao, Jiang Zhangshi, Jiang Gushi, and Xu Xiangxing. The families of the hostages later received letters from the bandits, requesting ransom payments on the 20th (the previous day) by the Xiao Dian Lake. This was detected by the Second Squadron of the County Police, stationed in the village, and Ma, the squadron leader, immediately dispatched Team Leader Wang to lead a team to suppress the bandits and rescue the hostages. Upon arriving at the destination, they were informed by the villagers that there were indeed four bandit boats lingering there. Team Leader Wang then ordered one policeman to be left on each boat to guard it, and the rest of the team landed and advanced. They saw a large crowd of villagers gathered and inquired whether there were any bandits, but all claimed ignorance, so they continued to advance. Unexpectedly, the bandits were mixed in with the crowd, intimidating the villagers from reporting. Seeing that the police had passed, the bandits gathered and opened fire on the boats the police had arrived on. Zhang Jinquan, who was guarding a boat at the time, was wounded in the leg. Upon hearing the gunshots, Team Leader Wang quickly ordered a counterattack. The bandits also opened fire to resist. The two sides exchanged fire for two hours, but the bandits did not retreat. Fortunately, Squadron Leader Ma led his team to reinforce them, and the bandits were defeated and retreated towards Cheng Lake. In the battle, a bandit named Zhang Binwu, who confessed to being a low-level leader in the gang, was wounded and died soon after from his injuries. Squadron Leader Ma immediately sent the wounded policeman to Boji Hospital for treatment and reported the bandit suppression to the headquarters. However, a large number of hostages have not yet been rescued.</p>

<p>Xu Bingren, an investigator sent by the Shaoxing County Government, captured Fu Yongyan (also known as Ying Ting), a robber involved in the robbery case of Shengkang Village in Shaoxing County, in Room 15 of the Mingli Inn outside of Changmen. 245 yuan in banknotes, two pawn tickets, two customs treasury notes, and other items were found in his suitcase. He was immediately handed over to the police and taken to the Third Branch. The suspect confessed to the robbery without denial. The suspect was then handed over to the investigator to be taken back for investigation.</p>
<p>New Developments in the Murder of the Opium Partner Case Zheng Wanglong, the main seller, beat to death his opium partner, Wang Xinyuan (also known as Wang Xinyuan, or Xiao Wang). The Public Security Bureau has sent Zheng Wang to the court for trial and detention. The deceased's wife has arrived from Shanghai and hired lawyer Xu Junyan to submit a petition to the District Procuratorate, seeking justice for her husband. Because the autopsy at the time showed that the death was due to an epidemic, the coffin may be opened for another examination to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>County Middle School Student Kidnapped and Escapes Zhang Zuxun, a student at Wu Yi County Middle School, is the 18-year-old son of Zhang Renfu, the former assistant of the Fourth District Office. He lives in Tianhuangtang Alley in the city. On the 15th of this month, Zuxun went to the East Gate for sightseeing and was kidnapped by bandits. His family was very anxious because he had not returned for several days. Later, they received a letter from the bandits, demanding a ransom of 15,000 yuan, at which point they realized he had been kidnapped. They inquired for several days but found no clues. Today (the 22nd), it was reported that Zuzhu had escaped from the bandit's lair and returned. It is said that the bandits guarding him were sleeping soundly, and Zhang took the opportunity to escape. However, he felt quite tired after walking from the countryside to the city.</p>
<p>Director of Education Bureau Resigns Again The financial situation of Wu Yi County's education is extremely dire, and the funding for various schools has been in arrears for many months. Yang Haoming, the Director of the Education Bureau, feels that it is really difficult to maintain the situation and had previously submitted his resignation, which was not approved. Recently, Director Yang submitted another resignation to the county government for submission to the Education Department, stating that until a replacement is appointed, Supervisor Sun Youguang will act as his agent.</p>

<p>Central Committee Member Cai Yuanpei Comes to Wuxi to Escape the Noise There has been talk recently that Cai Yuanpei, a member of the Central Committee and President of the Academia Sinica and Chairman of the Central University Reorganization Committee, will succeed Wang Jingwei as President of the Executive Yuan. Although various parties have high hopes for him, Cai remains detached and has not agreed. The other day, he quietly left Shanghai and came to Wuxi by car, staying at the home of a friend with the surname of a certain someone in the city. He traveled lightly and kept his whereabouts secret. When someone visited him, he said that the actual political responsibility of the Executive Yuan was too much for him, as he was old and weak and difficult to shoulder this burden. Therefore, he has come to this place of scenic beauty to rest and recuperate. He will return to Nanjing soon, as Central University urgently needs reorganization. However, the exact date of his return to Nanjing is still difficult to determine for the time being. As for the recently discovered Blood Soul Extermination Groups and other things, they are also a manifestation of the patriotism of the Chinese people. However, it is necessary to persist, act according to the law, unite with sincerity, and be unyielding. Only then can we achieve the final victory, and even strong armor and sharp weapons are not to be feared.</p>
<p>Participating in the Hangzhou Social Education Conference The Chinese Social Education Society will hold a meeting in Hangzhou tomorrow (the 24th).

Hua and others, after being appointed, departed from Wuxi for Hangzhou yesterday (the 22nd) to attend the preliminary conference.</p>

They kidnapped Deng's seven-year-old boy and carried him away. Deng, in desperation, chased after them. The bandits fired a shot backward, and the bullet grazed Deng's face, causing minor injuries. In the end, the boy was still taken away. The case has been reported to the police for investigation.</p>

The Yun Gong Association has already issued orders to the Gao and Bao counties, in accordance with the regulations set by the department for prohibiting the construction of houses on the top of the dike, to send police to order the demolition. It was found yesterday that the houses of the people along the dikes in Sishui in Bao County and Gaoyou have not been completely demolished, which is detrimental to flood prevention work. The County Government is hereby ordered to immediately dispatch police to demolish all houses along the dikes in its jurisdiction, whether newly built or old, and to ensure that nothing remains, in order to strengthen the dikes.</p>

<p>Eastern Township Discovery of Young Locusts: In the sixth district of this county, areas such as Huayuantou and Zhuhuitang have recently seen outbreaks of young locusts. The affected area is estimated to be several thousand acres. The locusts' heads have already turned red, and they are about to take flight. Farmers who witness this situation are filled with worry. Upon learning of this, the County Agricultural Experiment Station immediately dispatched assistant staff members Yao Yuqiu and Teng Fengji yesterday (the 16th) to rush to the area and guide the farmers in devising methods to eradicate the locusts.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor: We were astonished to read in your August 19th issue's Taicang local correspondence, under the headline "Patriotic Organizations Established One After Another," a report stating that the Youth Suicide Corps issued a severe warning to Wanhexiang Southern Goods Store for privately importing Japanese goods, and that upon investigation, two bullets were attached to the warning. Since the September 18th Incident, our store has indeed stopped buying and selling enemy goods, which can be verified. Moreover, at this time of national crisis, all people with a sense of righteousness are filled with grief and indignation and share the same hatred for the enemy. Our store's patriotism will certainly not lag behind others. Our conscience is clear and can be attested by Heaven and the sun. Furthermore, our store only received a warning letter from the Blood Soul Kill Traitors Corps, telling us to seal up the enemy goods we had previously stored. We did not receive any warning from the Youth Suicide Corps or the two bullets. This must be a misunderstanding. As it concerns our store's reputation, we respectfully request a correction. Wanhexiang Southern Goods Store, Shatou, Taicang, respectfully submitted on August 20th.</p>

<p>Tennis Star Qiu Feihai to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai, the Singaporean Chinese tennis star, will arrive here on the 26th of this month. He returned to Singapore from Shanghai last winter and has not been back since. Now that the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association's senior singles tournament is about to begin, and Qiu will participate, readers are understandably eager to know when he will arrive in Shanghai. It was once rumored that Qiu would arrive in Shanghai on the 20th of this month. However, according to reporter Lin Baohua, Qiu telegraphed Mr. Lin to say that he would arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of this month. This means that Qiu will be able to make it in time for his first week of the senior singles tournament against Smith, which is scheduled to take place before the 28th. Also, the Shen in the junior singles tournament is actually Mr. Sun Linfang. Mr. Sun went to Germany in 1930 to study tennis and returned to China this June. His forehand and backhand strokes are quite accomplished, but he is used to hard courts and not accustomed to playing on grass, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Youyou Cup Tennis Tournament: Yu Tianguang Loses to Qian Yaobin <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Change in Championship Prospects</p>
<p>Yesterday's matches in the Youyou Cup tennis tournament were all extremely important. Yu Tianguang actually lost to Qian Yaobin by a score of two to one, which may change the prospects for the championship. Qian's tennis skills seem to have improved significantly. His strength can be seen in his match against Guo Bida, and his victory over Yu yesterday was no fluke. Yu Tianguang had no control in the third set, allowing Qian to win 6-0. At the same time, Liang Deguang and Ma Anquan also competed fiercely. Liang's shots were very accurate yesterday, preventing Ma from developing his game. However, Ma is not weak, and it was not easy for him to regain a set in the third game. Although Tu Kaiyuan defeated Shen Baigui in three straight sets, Shen's shots often made Tu shake his head in dismay. Liang Guanying defeated Wang Minshi quite easily. Judging from yesterday's matches, the championship will depend on the schedule for this Friday, as these three games are the last of the tournament. The results of yesterday's matches and today's schedule are as follows:</p>
<p>Qian Yaobin defeated Yu Tianguang 7-9, 8-6, 6-0</p>
<p>Liang Deguang defeated Ma Anquan 6-4, 6-4, 8-6</p>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan defeated Shen Baigui 6-4, 6-3, 6-3</p>
<p>Liang Guanying defeated Wang Minshi 6-1, 6-2, 6-3</p>

<p>(II) Facilities</p>
<p>School Physical Education Facilities</p>
<p>(A) Fields: divided into ball games, track and field, equipment, national martial arts, and playgrounds. The size and quantity should be sufficient to implement the physical education curriculum standards for all levels of schools, with a standard of at least 100 square feet of open space for each student.</p>
<p>(B) Buildings: All buildings necessary for implementing the curriculum, such as gymnasiums, covered playgrounds, swimming pools, physical examination rooms, and medical rooms, should be built according to their capabilities.</p>
<p>(C) Equipment: All fixed and consumable equipment required for the curriculum and extracurricular activities should be fully equipped.</p>
<p>Sports Field Facilities</p>
<p>The area of the county sports field should be at least 30 mu, and the area of the provincial or executive Yuan-administered municipal sports field should be at least 80 mu. The construction and setting of various sports fields should be fully constructed according to the interests and needs of the entire county's population.</p>
<p>Simple sports fields can be more simply constructed according to the needs of the surrounding people.</p>
<p>Children's playgrounds should be fully equipped with children's play equipment and use them as a principle.</p>
<p>(III) Funding</p>
<p>The original proposal is revised as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The physical education funding for schools at all levels, in addition to the physical education fees paid by students, must account for at least 3% of the school's recurring expenses, but the salaries of physical education teachers and staff and special construction are not included.</p>
<p>(2) The recurring expenses of sports fields in each province, city, and county should account for at least 10% of the social education expenses of each province, city, and county, but construction and fixed equipment expenses are not included.</p>
<h3 id="e99">IV. Part on Implementation Methods (1) Research Work <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The materials used for physical education, the methods adopted, and the standards set must go through research procedures before they can comply with scientific principles and be timely.

Sports meetings assess personal achievements, which are only enough to promote the progress of personal achievements. It is a mistake to use this as a standard for evaluating the entire physical education of schools and the public, and to use it as a tool for promotion, in order to promote the popularization of physical education in schools and the public is like seeking fish from trees. On the other hand, physical education assessment is to examine the physical education achievements of the entire city of schools or cities, which can urge the progress of physical education for the majority of the people, and to use this as a means to evaluate the physical education of schools or cities is very reliable.</p>

<p>The state is quite complicated. Yesterday's gold bidding situation was very chaotic, erratic, and unpredictable. There were twists and turns of six taels before and after the market, and the supply and demand varied, the people's hearts were hesitant, and in the end, it rose slightly by a few cents. The opening was still flat, although the silver market reported a drop, it was not moved, which was really affected by the unstable situation and the intensifying situation in the hot provinces. Afterwards, buyers were active, and the exchange rate seemed good, so it showed firmness and then became loose and excessive. Then, sellers suddenly became courageous, and fell from 719 taels to 13 taels, and finally returned to flat. Later, due to the request from the industry to stop trading on Wednesday afternoon, a disturbance occurred. The opening was late, and the market was weak at first and then firm, but there was not much trading. The details of the whole day are recorded below. The morning market changed repeatedly. The October opening in the morning was 717 taels without any honor or disgrace. The previous large bar fell back by 16/5, and the silver price only fell by 3/8. The private telegram was only slightly 16/3, so people's hearts were not good. Then it was 7.5 taels, but Yuan Mao, Yonghengxing, Yuan Yuhe, Yuanheng, Zhaofengchang and others had more than constant selling intentions, and immediately dropped 2 taels, to 15.5 taels. After a while, various banks absorbed US dollars in November at 31.0625 yuan, and October at 30.875 yuan, and Yifeng, Yonghengxing, Zhaofengchang, Hengzhen, Yuan Dasing, Yongruixing, etc. bought them one after another, so the price jumped by 3-4 taels, to 19 taels and 3 qian. At that time, Fuyu, Hengchang, Yong Yuanheng, Zhifeng, and Yong Jun sold them, probably because the near-term US dollar could be settled at 6875, so it was 17 taels. When the 9:30 order was opened, it was around 18 taels, and the listed prices were reduced by 125, but the inside seemed good. Maixing entered November at 31.0625 yuan, and Zhengjin absorbed August at 6875. Fuxingyong, Zhifengyong, Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, Tongtaichang, etc. all came to compete for purchases, causing the price to return to 19 taels and 2 qian. After 9:45, Maixing suddenly came out with US dollars in August at 75, and people's hearts suddenly became weak. Bingxing, Yuan Kangxiang, Hongxing, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Hengxing, Yuan Yifengyong, Zhaofengchang and others were excited to sell, and in just 20 minutes, it plummeted by 6 taels, to 10:00, and finally became 13 taels. After entering, it seemed to be going back up, but only fluctuating around 1 tael, around 15 taels. The cashiering of various numbers was complicated. Then Hengxing came to enter the exchange market, which was still flat, until 11:00, it was 16 taels. However, Hengxing, Hengxingyuan, Hengchangyong, Fuyu, items, etc. re-disposed, causing the price to drop again by 2 taels. At 11:30, it was 14 taels. Yifengyong and Yuan Maoyong came to enter, and then it closed at 15.6 qian.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was slightly late. The afternoon market was delayed until 3:00, at 13.5 taels. Because people's hearts were weak and the exchange rate was loose, Mitsui came out with British gold in November at 4375, and Huabi came out with 9 US dollars at 875, so it was slightly down to 12.8 qian. Afterwards, Maixing absorbed September at 8/25, and Zhaofengchang, Hongkangyong, and Junjin entered. When it was added to 14.5 taels, it depreciated by 5-6 qian. Then, Hengxingyuan, Yifengyong, Tianfengyong, and Hengchangyong competed to enter, and US dollars in December were transacted between Huashangdian and various banks at 375 to 3125, so the market turned from weak to strong. In a blink of an eye, the loan was more than 4 taels high, and it was 18.5 taels at 3:30, which was unexpected. Then, Tongtaichang and retail households came out, and then dropped 1 tael and 4 qian, to 17.1 qian. Suddenly, it was raised by 1 tael, to 18.1 qian, but the closing was still at 4:00, and the price of 17.6 qian was 6 qian higher than last Saturday, continuing to rise to above 19 taels, which was really bought by Yuan Mao, Yongda, etc. According to the largest between 1 and 2, it was 19.3 qian, and the smallest was 12.8 qian, with a total difference of 6.5 taels. The naked bar was 9.5 taels higher, and the published price was changed to 790 taels. The US dollar went back to small 125, which was 71 taels, and after 2 taels, it was 77 taels, 74 taels at noon and 76 taels in the afternoon. As a result, it was 71 taels, which was 12 taels more than last Saturday, with a registration of 16 taels and a supplement of 16 taels, and 18 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The transactions of various numbers are different. There are many complicated transactions on the table. According to statistics, Yifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Fuxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Hengxing, etc. are all entering, and Tongtaichang, Yuan Kangxiang, Yuan Maoyong, and Yuhe are cashing out. Zhifengyong, Hongkangyong, Bingxing, Hengchangyong, Futaiheng, Yuantai, Yuanheng, etc. are all cashing out. Hengxingyuan has a total of 3,000 and several hundred items, with supply exceeding demand, and the exchange rate hedging is entering. In the afternoon, Zhaofengchang, Tianfengyong, Yifengyong, Fuyu, Hengchangyong, and Hengxingyuan all entered. Hongkangyong, Yuantai, Yuhe, Hengyu, Yuanheng, and Tongfu, etc. had a lot of cashing out. Dacheng and Tongtaichang all cashed out. Zhifengyong cashed out and then entered again. On that day, the Dalian gang only had 200-300 items, and the Guangdong gang entered more than 300 items, with few cash outs. The total number of items for each number is still about 22,000.</p>
<p>The problem of Wednesday's post-market break has not yet been resolved. The incident of the dispute between the numbers and the institute in the afternoon of yesterday's gold market was because the institute issued a notice last Saturday that the business hours in the afternoon and the post-market on Wednesdays will all return to the old regulations from the beginning of this week. However, this notice was not sent to the brokers' association, so the agents of each number came forward to negotiate. However, they all expressed sympathy for the afternoon opening and closing times. As for Wednesday afternoons, because there is no market for exchange rates, they demanded a permanent break. Therefore, at 2:00 yesterday, the group petitioned the board of directors. The chairman of the board of directors, Xu Busun, had not yet arrived at the institute, so it could not be resolved. However, the agents were determined to achieve their goals and were unwilling to go to the market to open the market, arguing for a long time. Fortunately, Zhao Zhongying, a standing director, was afraid that the turmoil would expand, so he allowed them to reply today (the 23rd). The agents were satisfied and immediately entered the market to trade, so the opening was already at 3:00.</p>

However, the gold market had many twists and turns, with a total difference of six or seven taels, and finally rose slightly, but the situation in North China was tight, and people's hearts were floating. The transactions of various banks were not bad, but only tens of thousands of pounds were traded in British gold, and about 6-700,000 yuan in US dollars. The Chinese gold industry generally sold out to hedge the slips, and the banks had a good appetite, with the Inner China Bank being the most.</p>

<p>The market situation is a microcosm. Yesterday, when the banks opened and closed, most people had the idea that the foreign cent would definitely rise due to the strong momentum of the foreign cent the day before, and they were mostly in the foreign aspect, and they were still afraid that the banks would still compete for purchases, waiting for the time to seek a good price, so although the price of cents rose in the early market, the transaction was relatively inferior. In the noon market, it suddenly became an opposite example to people's ideas, resulting in a huge setback, and the market suddenly changed. The insider is unknown, and this kind of change has been heard recently, and the money market has not been able to turn around due to the lack of uses, and it is still flat and tired.</p>
<p>The reason for the cent's sharp rise and fall, the early market of the foreign cent, suddenly rose by more than 1 cent, which is 6 qian 9 fen 3 li, which is a huge rise of 2 li compared to the early market of the previous day. In the noon market, it fell back greatly for no reason, which is a drop of 1 cent and a half, which is 6 qian 9 fen 1 li and a half, and the result is slightly less than 2 hao and a half compared to the price of the previous noon. [Silver tear-down] The tear-down of the early and noon markets is 7 points, which is slightly better than the noon market of the previous day, and the cut-head plus water is still only 3-4 points. The current situation of the money market has no very clear image, and the wide angle shrinks with the cent, and the Jiangnan small ocean, with the transaction being sluggish, the market price has not changed at all, and the early and noon markets are the same as 6 qian, and the transaction is only 4,000 jiao in the early market, the Guangdong small ocean, recently it is still peaceful, but the foreign cent has ups and downs from time to time, yesterday morning, the cent rose, so it rose more than 1 li, which is 5 qian 8 fen 6 li and a half, and the cent fell slightly in the noon market, which is 5 qian 8 fen 6 li, and the transaction is 120,000 jiao in the early market, 45,000 jiao in the noon market, and the copper yuan shrank by 1,000 wen, which is 429,000,000 wen, and the transaction price is 10,200 taels of silver, totaling more than 43,700 strings of wen.</p>
<p>The collection and delivery of silver loans is quite complicated. Yesterday, due to the opening and closing of banks, the collection and delivery increased more than usual, with the Chinese merchants collecting and delivering more than 2.9 million tickets and loans, and the foreign merchants collecting and delivering more than 3.1 million tickets and loans, with a special loan of 1.2 million, an electric remittance loan of more than 800,000, a pledge transaction of 1.45 million, various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous loans collected and delivered 10.78 million, Chinese merchants took out of the warehouse 800,000, foreign merchants 600,000, Qianzhuang Yinkong bought and sold 32 million, the collection and delivery of cut-head loans was 4.8 million, and the collection and delivery of remittance loans from various roads was more than 700,000, and the collection and delivery of total loans was more than 1 million, and the tear-down ticket transaction was 6.34 million.</p>

Only the customs tax of 966 was still only tens of thousands of yuan. As for the changes in the prices of various bonds, it was the Japanese army entering Rehe, the Sino-Japanese war re-opening, and the situation in the north was serious again. As a result, the general public's heart turned weak, and selling transactions were very prosperous. When it was first opened in the morning, the prices fell rapidly at the same rate, but after the prices of the various bonds fell, the market's supplementary transactions turned smooth, and the supply and demand returned to flat. Afterwards, the various plates hovered and fluctuated very little, and the result was a drop of 6-7 jiao to 1 yuan and 5-6 jiao compared to the previous one. The form of the bond market is still not optimistic, but for the time being, there will not be a huge continuation of the decline.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market dipped in the morning and stabilized in the afternoon, showing a daily weakening trend. Although there was no significant increase in real demand, sporadic purchases continued. As a result, buyers remained firm, seizing even small opportunities to buy. Rongxing Guan, in particular, held onto a large number of contracts, anticipating a potential surge in sales around the Mid-Autumn Festival. This further strengthened the buying pressure. However, the intense Japanese invasion of Rehe significantly impacted the yarn market.</p>
<p>Human Label Futures Fell Six to Seven Candareens: The market opened lower, with a lack of buyers in the trading floor, causing prices to fall by five, six, eight candareens to 0.011 to 0.012 taels. In the afternoon, there were reports of slight trading activity from the Sichuan group, but most of the purchases were for forward contracts. The opening price rose by three or four candareens, but then fell again at the close. Overall, the domestic economy remains strained, and purchasing power remains weak. Total daily trading volume was 19,650 bales. Changfeng bought 1,500 bales, Yiyu 500 bales, and Zhenda 400 bales. Yikang bought 550 bales, Yichang 1,650 bales, Dachangcheng 850 bales, Dachang 550 bales, and Rongxing 800 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market became more downstream-oriented, with a relaxed atmosphere. The domestic new cotton production situation is generally good, and tomorrow marks the start of the Autumnal Equinox, which is expected to dispel any adverse trends. Therefore, people's sentiment has softened significantly. According to some cotton merchants, the harvest this year will be abundant and the prices in the producing areas are likely to be low. A certain major merchant has been selling off large quantities. However, general buyers have not yet entered the market due to the stability of foreign cotton. Most are in a bullish position.</p>
<p>Zheng Label Futures Fall by 0.0045 Taels: The market opened lower, with a lack of buyers despite the good quality of American cotton. Prices fell by 0.002 to 0.004 taels in various months. The afternoon opening saw a flat market, with prices falling another 0.0005 to 0.0025 taels in various months. Total daily trading volume was 79,700 piculs.

<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday's rice situation saw about 20 to 30 shipments from various groups. The stockpiles at the docks are still substantial. Sales in both urban and rural stores are sluggish, mainly because new rice has started to arrive from various places. Letters from the producing areas indicate that older stocks are being released. Thick japonica rice prices have fallen by another 0.03 taels. Demand for early and late rice is low, with opening prices falling by 0.04 taels. Duyang superior rice has been affected by the new superior rice, with market prices falling by about 0.02 to 0.03 taels. Both new japonica and new superior rice are gradually declining in price. However, Huayuan rice is scarce, and there is significant demand for rice for food exchange. Fragrant rice prices remain firm.</p>
<p>Shanghai North West Road: Supplies are abundant, but trading in this street is very stagnant, with prices plummeting. Compared to ten days ago, prices have fallen by about 0.03 taels. Recently, new japonica rice has been arriving in abundance, driving the market further downstream. Both thick and thin japonica rice are down by 0.03 to 0.04 taels. There is a shortage of Luyang superior rice, with prices set at the opening. New japonica rice is falling in price along with the South market.</p>
<h3 id="e121">North Group Rice Sales are Active <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Xiang Rice Second Batch Arrives at Port: The third batch will arrive soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market showed slight improvement due to purchases from the North group, improving market sentiment. In addition to buying Xiang rice, the North group also purchased about 2,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice. Xiaojiao rice prices immediately rose by 0.005 taels. A total of 5,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were offered at prices ranging from 0.091 to 0.0897 taels, with older rice priced from 0.0874 to 0.0867 taels. In addition to the North group, the Ningbo group purchased 1,000 bags, with the remainder being purchased by local and inland Zhenjiang merchants. 200 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were priced from 0.098 to 0.0967 taels and were purchased by local merchants. The inland group also purchased 350 bags of red Xiaojiao rice, priced from 0.0807 to 0.0795 taels, which was also slightly more stable than the previous market.</p>
<p>The second batch of Hunan rice, consisting of 310 bags, arrived yesterday from Xinnin Xing, handled by Yutai. It was sold immediately at the market. Jinggang rice was priced at 0.09 taels (210 bags), and Jinggang rice was priced at 0.085 taels (100 bags), a 0.002 tael decrease from the previous day. However, the quality was lower, resulting in a more stable market. It is rumored that the third batch, consisting of over 1,000 bags, has also been shipped and is expected to arrive within the next three to five days.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Starch Powder Prices Fall Sharply <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the starch powder market in the morning, prices for all months showed a consistent sharp decline. As foreign wheat quotations continued to fall by 0.02 to 0.05 taels, people's sentiment was already unstable. This was further aggravated by the simultaneous actions of major factories, layer upon layer of sell-offs, resulting in a market that plunged straight down with no looking back. In addition, the serious situation in the North raised concerns that actual sales would be affected. The poor market sentiment offered little chance for recovery. Prices fell by 0.011 to 0.012 taels for near months and 0.03 taels for distant months. At the afternoon opening, people's sentiment remained poor, with prices falling by another 0.01 taels or so. However, by the second round of trading, prices rose slightly as floating short positions were covered and factory sell-offs eased. However, the overall trend suggests that the market will remain weak. The results showed a fall of 0.0175 taels for the current month, a slight fall of 0.02 taels for September, a slight fall of 0.0225 taels for October/November, a slight fall of 0.0275 taels for December, and a slight fall of 0.025 taels for January.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of wheat futures in the morning and afternoon, the market for all months generally showed a sharp decline. With foreign wheat quotations continuing to fall by approximately 0.02 to 0.05 taels, continued price declines and further increases in the exchange rate for foreign wheat imports will be difficult to avoid. The current month, due to approaching delivery, saw some buying activity, which somewhat mitigated the decline. However, the more distant May contracts were heavily sold, causing significant anxiety and resulting in a gradual decline. Although domestic wheat prices have not fallen significantly, the impact of foreign wheat is perceived as detrimental. The results showed a slight fall of 0.02 taels for August, a slight fall of 0.05 taels for September, a slight fall of 0.06 taels for October/November, and a slight fall of 0.07 taels for December. The spot wheat market has once again become quiet. However, 500 bags of Niuzhuang ten-day goods were offered at a price of 3.0338 taels. It is extremely rare to see northern wheat coming to the south.</p>

<p>Haikou Dried Meat Declines Sharply, Guard Against Rebound</p>
<p>Haikou Branches: Supplies Scarce, Prices Rise</p>
<p>The longan harvest in Zhangzhou this year is expected to be quite abundant. The first batch of new goods arrived yesterday on the Taikoo Company's Jinan vessel, totaling over one hundred and ten pieces. Samples are expected to be available today. Current stockpiles are low, and opening prices are expected to be favorable.</p>
<p>Due to an increase in arrivals, Haikou dried meat prices have fallen by 0.05 to 0.06 taels. Trading prices have also decreased accordingly. However, since prices are already low, sales are still active. It was reported yesterday that shipments from Guangdong have decreased significantly, raising hopes for a small rebound after the sharp decline.</p>
<p>The arrival of Haikou branches has been decreasing recently. Yesterday, over 2,000 pieces of numbered goods were offered, with top-grade branches rising by 0.02 to 0.03 taels. There was not much change in middle and lower-grade branches. Trading prices are also tightening, and the market may need to rise further.</p>

<p>This year's silkworm cocoon harvest in Shandong Province is expected to be poor, resulting in a decrease in the production of silkworm cocoon byproducts.

With a gradual recovery in sales in Europe and America, new goods have started to be shipped to Shanghai. Last week, 548 pieces of new Shandong silk heads, such as Changtu and Diwanshou, were shipped to Shanghai by the Yanjing scheduled steamer and stored in warehouses to await display.</p>

<p>Yesterday, needle-like and xiu-like eyebrow green teas from various locations, such as Luzhuang and Tuzhuang, were in high demand among major British and French firms. The goods that arrived were almost immediately sold, resulting in an exceptionally popular market. Prices rose again by 0.03 to 0.04 taels. There was also strong demand from major Wuyuan firms, such as Jinlong, Yihe, and Xiehe, resulting in a firm market. In addition, there were no changes in the situation for Zhenmei and Zhucha teas. Russian firms began discussing prices for Gongxi green tea yesterday, but the prices offered were too low, and no transactions were made. However, Bai Tou firms and Tuzhuang tea factories still showed some sporadic interest.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Hardware Market Still Shows No Improvement <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: As the golden wind brings coolness and the summer gradually fades, the hardware market was expected to see a turnaround. Unfortunately, the adverse environment, tight credit, national affairs in turmoil, and suppression of bandits and communists have made it impossible for merchants and residents to enjoy their work. How can we expect the hardware industry to develop? Simply managing to maintain the market without it collapsing would be a great fortune. Lately, hardware sales have been sluggish. Fortunately, imports have not been widespread, and stockpiles are not excessively large, which helps to stabilize prices. Key items are detailed below:</p>
<p>24 Gauge British Galvanized Iron: Prices Rise Sharply: Extreme Scarcity Leads to Rebound: It is only natural that prices rise after extreme scarcity. Previously, the price of 24 gauge thick British galvanized iron fell sharply due to abundant stockpiles and sluggish sales, with a picul only valued at around 9 taels. Considering the import costs, merchants were losing as much as 0.04 taels. In recent days, however, there has been very high demand from train stations along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines, with total purchases reaching over 20,000 sheets. This has led to a temporary shortage of spot goods, causing prices to rise sharply. Currently, the price can reach as high as 11.05 taels per picul, but there is still a shortage of spot goods. Based on the current situation, prices are expected to rise further. Prices for other gauges, such as 26 and 28 gauge, have also increased by several candareens. 26 gauge is priced at 11.05 taels per picul, and 28 gauge is priced at 11.075 taels, with 6-foot sheets at 8.05 taels and 7-foot sheets at 1 tael.</p>
<p>Black Iron Sheets: Showing Signs of Recovery: With the weather gradually cooling, demand from the north has suddenly increased, giving the black iron sheet market signs of recovery. Prices have also risen sharply, with a picul valued at around 9 taels, an increase of 0.05 to 0.06 taels from before. It was reported yesterday that 700 to 800 bundles were sold to Tianjin merchants.</p>
<p>Tinplate: Market Remains Stable: Imports of this commodity are high, while sales are low. Market sentiment is stable, with a picul valued at 11.05 taels. Prices have remained unchanged for several weeks. Although overseas prices fluctuate, local merchants have managed to maintain prices due to cost considerations, which is commendable.</p>

<p>Shandong Coal Trading Also Active</p>
<p>Sales of Fengtian white coal dust have been sluggish since the summer, with weak prices. Recently, merchants from Hangzhou, the Lake area, and other inland regions have been increasing their purchases, and prices have improved slightly. Market transactions yesterday included 150 tons of original coal dust purchased by Hangzhou merchants at a price of 8.035 taels, 200 tons of new goods purchased by Jiaxing merchants at a price of 0.0825 taels, and 150 tons of original coal dust purchased by Huzhou merchants at a price of 8.03 taels, as well as 80 tons of Hongqi dust at a price of 9.05 taels.</p>
<p>In addition, local shipping companies in Shanghai South are showing strong interest in Tong coal from Boshan and Dashan in Shandong Province. Trading in the entire city is very active, and prices are firm. Prices for Dashan Tong coal and Heishan Tong have risen by 0.025 taels, and prices for Xihe Tong have also risen by 0.01 taels. However, Boshan Yuan Tong is still selling for 9.075 taels per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Song Ziwen Flew to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>To Carry Out the Collection of Paper Currency Tax</p>
<p>Banking Community Urges Postponement of Tax Collection, Possibly Approved</p>
<p>Currently Negotiating Loan with Various Banks</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, after flying to Nanjing with Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei to discuss the resignation of Wang and Zhang with Chairman Lin and Military Affairs Council Chairman Jiang, returned to Nanjing the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 8:20 AM, he, along with Director of the Department of Health Liu Ruiheng, Secretary Huang Chun Tao, Finance Department Advisor Qin Jingfu, and others, took a private Sikorsky airplane from Nanjing to Shanghai. Song's mission this time is to discuss the issue of collecting paper currency tax with the banking community in Shanghai. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Consulting with Zhang Shouyong: After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Song returned to his private residence on Qiqi Road for a short rest. At approximately 9:00 AM, he drove to visit Zhang Shouyong, Advisor to the Ministry of Finance, for about an hour to discuss the issue of collecting paper currency tax nationwide. Song, aware that the banking community in Shanghai is urging a postponement of the tax collection, but also realizing that the financial difficulties make the tax collection necessary, sought Zhang's opinion on this matter.</p>
<p>Banking Community's Opinion: A Central News Agency reporter interviewed a member of the Shanghai banking community yesterday to inquire about their opinion on the Ministry of Finance's collection of paper currency tax. According to them, various countries in Europe and America have certain regulations regarding the collection of paper currency tax from banks. For example, Bank A with a certain amount of capital is allowed to issue a certain amount of paper currency. If the amount of paper currency issued by that bank exceeds the prescribed amount, it will be taxed according to the promulgated paper currency tax regulations. Therefore, the banking community itself is not affected much. The paper currency tax promulgated by our country's Ministry of Finance on August 1, 1930, does not have such a provision. All banks that issue paper currency, regardless of the amount of paper currency issued, are taxed at 2.5% of the 40% reserve requirement of the paper currency issuance amount. If this regulation is followed, it will place a heavy burden on the banking community. In recent years, domestic wars and disasters have been frequent, and financial panic has reached its peak. The burden borne by the banking community is impossible to increase. Therefore, the Shanghai banking community is making every effort to urge a postponement of the Ministry of Finance's collection of paper currency tax. The estimated total amount of pure currency in the country is over 300 million yuan. Collecting according to the promulgated paper currency tax rate would yield over 3 million yuan annually. It is rumored that the total amount of paper currency in the country is 20 billion yuan, which is not true. A spokesperson for the Bankers Association told a Central News Agency reporter that they do not want to make any claims regarding the Ministry of Finance's planned implementation of the paper currency tax. The association has designated Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China, Lu Jianquan of the Bank of Communications, and Hu Bijiang of the Zhongnan Bank to personally present a petition to Minister Song this afternoon to explain everything. However, as of the time of the interview (4:00 PM), they had not yet left. The contents of the petition are temporarily confidential. However, the banking community is truly unable to bear such a large tax burden due to the difficult times, and therefore requests that the tax collection be waived.</p>
<p>Significance of Paper Currency Tax: The spokesperson for the Bankers Association also said that paper currency tax is also implemented in various countries in Europe and America, but it is collected only on the amount of issuance that exceeds the prescribed issuance limit. The national banks strictly adhere to this regulation. For example, if the prescribed paper currency issuance limit for a certain bank is one million, if its paper currency increases to one million and several tens of thousands, then the excess of tens of thousands will be subject to a certain percentage of issuance tax. This is to control the excessive issuance of paper currency and also contains the meaning of business tax. Therefore, the burden on the banking industry is not considered too heavy.</p>
<p>Tax Rate: The spokesperson also said that the paper currency tax rate stipulated by the Ministry of Finance is 0.25% (2.5/1000), and its target of collection is the reserve portion of paper currency issuance, that is, 40% of the full amount. Therefore, calculated as a percentage of the full issuance amount, the percentage of collection is 1%. The current amount of paper currency in our country is over 300 million yuan. Calculated at 1%, the tax burden is approximately 3 million yuan per year. Under the current economic downturn, it is difficult for the banking industry to bear. Furthermore, there is no provision for the collection of paper currency tax from foreign banks. This kind of uneven tax collection will cause domestic banks to reduce their issuance to reduce their burden, while foreign banks will increase their issuance due to the profitability, and the result will be to destroy the meager achievements of the Chinese banking industry in the past ten years.</p>
<p>Difficulties with the General Treasury: A member of the banking community also said that today's newspaper reported a Nanjing dispatch that the Ministry of Finance, in order to maintain the credit of paper currency, decided to organize a general treasury for paper currency reserves, consisting of 60% of the cash reserves of various banks. The banking community believes this news to be a rumor. Each bank needs to have a cash reserve of over 60% when issuing paper currency in order to maintain its credit. Each bank is responsible for maintaining its own credit, and there is no reason to combine the reserves into one place. In fact, it is impossible to do so. Chen Weiqing's Remarks: Yesterday, the Central News Agency reporter visited Chen Weiqing, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, at the Central Bank, and asked whether the Ministry of Finance's intention to establish a general treasury for cash reserves was accurate, and what the extent of the progress of the paper currency issuance tax collection was. According to Secretary Chen, he had not heard of the Ministry of Finance's intention to establish a general treasury for cash reserves and had only seen it in the newspapers. If the Ministry of Finance needs to establish a general treasury for cash reserves, it should consult with the banking community in advance, or solicit their opinions. But the Ministry of Finance and the banking community have not had any contact or solicitation regarding this matter so far. Therefore, the claim that it will be established on September 1, as reported in the newspaper, should be inaccurate. As for the Ministry of Finance's collection of paper currency issuance tax, the regulations were promulgated as early as August 1, 1930, but have not been implemented to this day. Recently, the Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent paper currency from flooding the market, decided to implement the paper currency issuance tax and has notified various banks accordingly. However, the banking community is currently requesting a postponement of the tax collection.</p>
<p>Finance Department Plans to Borrow Money: According to financial circles, the purpose of the Finance Department's current implementation of the paper currency issuance tax is to remedy the financial difficulties. The banking community's plea for a postponement of the tax collection may be approved by the Finance Department, but in order to resolve the financial difficulties, a remedy must be sought. This remedy has not yet been determined. The Finance Department intends to temporarily postpone the tax collection, but must first mortgage this tax revenue to the banking community. The tax revenue will be deducted and repaid after the tax collection begins at a later date. However, the banking community believes that the paper currency issuance tax has not yet been implemented, so it cannot be mortgaged. If the authorities are in financial difficulty, they can negotiate loans with various banks separately. Observing the current situation, the paper currency issuance tax may be temporarily postponed. In order to remedy the current financial difficulties, the Finance Department will negotiate loans with various banks separately.</p>

<p>The Various Trade Associations in the City Telegraphed the League of Nations Investigation Team Yesterday, Requesting That They Report the Truth to the League of Nations with a Spirit of Fearlessness, Sanction Violent Japan, Do Not Succumb to Any Influence, and Prevent Hidden Concerns About the Future of the World: The Original Telegram Stated: "To Mr. Gu Shaochuan in Beiping, Translated and Forwarded to the Gentlemen of the League of Nations Investigation Team, Ever Since Japan Used the Despicable Means of Starting a War Without a Declaration on September 18 Last Year, Contrary to International Practice, and Attacked Our Liaoning and Jilin, Our Frontier Officials Have Repeatedly Ordered the Troops to Retreat in Order to Avoid Responsibility for the Conflict. The Central Government Has Consistently Trusted the League of Nations in Order to Maintain Peace in East Asia.

<h3 id="e131">The Red Blood Assassination Corps Throws a Bomb at the Asia Company <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Bomb Explodes, Company's Glass Windows Shattered</p>
<p>Shop Assistant Liang Naihu Suffers Head Injury from the Blast</p>
<p>Japanese Marines Arrive at the Scene to Investigate</p>
<p>Taking Numerous Photographs of the Aftermath of the Explosion</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Asia Bookstore Company at the north end of the Sichuan Road Bridge in this city, due to selling "enemy goods" and ignoring warnings, was bombed by the Red Blood Assassination Corps. The blast injured shop assistant Ran Naihu and destroyed doors, windows, counters, etc. The detailed account of the incident is as follows:</p>
<p>Shop Owner Driven by Profit. The Asia Bookstore Company, located at No. 18-20 North Sichuan Road, was founded by Li Yaonan, a Cantonese. The interior was elaborately decorated, and the business was quite prosperous. However, the stationery and supplies inside were all products of the Japanese company 克利洋行(Keli 洋行), and it also sold Japanese 金箭牌(Jin Jianpai, Golden Arrow) and 拜羅(Bailuo) fountain pens. Li had profited handsomely from this. After the January 28th Incident and the signing of the ceasefire agreement, Li, believing the opportunity had returned, secretly imported a large batch of Japanese stationery, intending to profit by taking advantage of the autumn school opening season for various schools. However, the Red Blood Assassination Corps detected this. Around 8:00 PM on the 20th, they sent personnel with a warning letter to the company, instructing them to seal up all Japanese goods within 48 hours and issue a public apology, or face appropriate consequences. Li Yaonan ignored the letter. Therefore, the Red Blood Assassination Corps resorted to the final measure yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Sudden Bombing. Around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the company's shop assistants, with no customers coming in, gathered in the shop to chat. Around 9:00 AM, a shop assistant named Liang Naihu returned to the shop from outside. A young man in a Western suit followed closely behind. Liang did not pay much attention at the time. However, as Liang entered the door, he saw the young man raise his hand inward, and a loud explosion occurred behind Liang. Instantly, iron fragments flew everywhere. The glass window counters on the left and in the middle facing the street, displaying Golden Arrow and Bailuo fountain pens, were shattered. A hole was blasted in the wooden board under the middle window counter. Liang's head was also injured by the iron fragments. The order in the shop was instantly disrupted, and the doors and windows were completely destroyed. The young man took the opportunity to escape at that moment.</p>
<p>Shop Assistant Injured. After the incident, nearby Chinese police officers on duty immediately reported to the Hongkou Police Station. They promptly dispatched personnel to the scene to investigate and collected the exploded iron fragments, taking them back to the police station for investigation. The injured shop assistant, Liang Naihu, was taken to the Fumin Hospital at Yokohama Bridge by the company itself. As the injuries were minor, the hospital doctor removed the iron fragments, applied medicine, and bandaged him. He returned to the company around 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Pays Great Attention. After the police station inspected the scene, the Japanese Marines also arrived upon hearing the news. Two officers led guards directly to the company. At the same time, the Japanese Consulate also sent personnel to investigate the situation. They temporarily dispatched two Japanese soldiers to guard the entrance of the company, prohibiting people from coming and going nearby. Finally, the Japanese officers took many photographs of the bombed situation of the company, questioned the staff about the situation at that time, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Lushan Strange Case: Zhu Niu Commits Adultery, Murders Aunt and Kills Son, Sentenced to Death, Adulterer Innocent? <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>At the foot of Mount Lushan in Jiangxi Province, there lived a farmer nicknamed Zhu Xiaogui. He married a local woman named Niu as his wife. Niu was somewhat attractive. After coming to the Zhu family, they initially lived in harmony. Later, Niu suddenly became disgusted with her husband's ugly appearance and committed adultery with Wang Keming in the village, leading to the murder of her husband's aunt and son. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Strangled Aunt with Both Hands. After Niu began her affair with Wang Keming, she became passionately infatuated with him. She would often keep Wang in her room late at night for illicit pleasure. Xiaogui had heard about it but was afraid of his wife's power and believed that family scandals should not be aired, so he did not interfere and let her do as she pleased. Xiaogui had an old mother who disapproved of the situation. However, she did not dare to directly scold them, only offering gentle advice. Niu, feeling ashamed and angered, saw her aunt as a thorn in her side. One night, she tricked her aunt into the room and strangled her to death with both hands. Xiaogui was gambling outside at the time and did not know the details. He believed Niu's story that his mother had died of a sudden illness.</p>
<p>Young Grandson Complains, Also Poisoned to Death. Although Niu was able to deceive Xiaogui about the murder of his aunt, her own eldest son spread the news everywhere, seeking justice for his grandmother. Niu hated him to the bone. That night, she mixed arsenic into his food and forced him to swallow it. Thus, her son also died, bleeding from all seven orifices. The souls of the pitiful grandmother and grandson went to the King of Hell to seek justice.</p>
<p>Immortal Unhappy, Draws Sword to Help. At the time, Lü Dongbin had not yet attained enlightenment. He witnessed the events on Mount Lushan and wanted to seek justice, but he was instead attacked, his hands and feet bound, and thrown into a bottomless cave. Fortunately, He Xiangu rescued him and put the adulterous woman to death. The adulterer, due to some connection, escaped punishment. The details of this story are recorded in the "Biography of the Eight Immortals Attaining Enlightenment" published by the Natural Bookstore.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Hunan Rice Embargo Lifted, Two Million Shi Shipped to Shanghai <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sends Riverboats to Transport</p>
<p>Hunan has historically been a rice-producing region. In recent years, it has suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities, resulting in barren fields. It had to purchase rice from outside to feed its people. This year, the rice harvest in various parts of Hunan was abundant. The Hunan province had banned the export of rice for many years. This year's autumn harvest was a bumper crop. The provincial government lifted the ban, allowing rice to be shipped out of the province. The first batch is about to arrive in Shanghai. The details are as follows, as investigated and recorded by our reporter.</p>
<p>Lifting of the Embargo. This year, Hunan province had a bumper harvest. The rice yield has increased several times compared to previous years. Based on investigation results, the Hunan provincial government determined that after meeting the food needs of the entire province, there was a large surplus. In order to adjust the grain shortage in neighboring provinces, it was decided to lift the rice embargo and allow export. The provincial government can also increase its revenue from rice export taxes. After discussion at the provincial affairs meeting, it was decided to initially allow two million shi to be exported. The decision to continue lifting the ban will depend on the situation in Hunan.</p>
<p>Dispatching Ships for Transport. The rice exported from Hunan will mainly be sold to Shanghai and Ningbo. All shipments will be delivered in Shanghai. Shanghai rice merchants have already gone to Hunan to purchase rice. Upon receiving the report, the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company urgently sent personnel to Hunan to investigate. It was confirmed that the grain embargo had been lifted. The business department of the company then decided to dispatch large riverboat from the Yangtze River fleet to operate a direct Shanghai-Hunan route, specifically to transport the rice being exported. The first batch is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Competition Among Ships. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also borrowed iron barges from the Hanyang Arsenal and the Pingxiang Coal Mine to Changsha for transferring rice to ships. It also plans to add the Jiangjing boat to the Changsha route during periods of congestion to increase the tonnage of rice transported. Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and San Peh Steam Navigation Company have all received the news and have dispatched riverboats to Changsha to compete to transport the two million shi of Hunan rice to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Cotton Weaving Industry Cancels All Subsidies <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Realizing the Spirit of Labor-Management Cooperation</p>
<p>The cotton weaving industry in this city has been under the dual pressure of economic aggression from imperialism and domestic political turmoil for many years. It has been difficult to sustain itself even in normal times. Since last year's national flood, the purchasing power of the Chinese people has greatly decreased. The United Kingdom has also abolished the gold standard to increase exports, and the Japanese are also making every effort to dump goods. As a result, domestic goods factories with weak capital and high costs are facing stockpiles and are on the verge of collapse. To save themselves, they must reduce costs. The Silk and Cotton Weaving Industry Association sent a letter to the industrial unions of the cotton weaving industry in various districts, requesting that both labor and management coexist and prosper by reducing wages. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the labor representatives understood the difficulties of the management and were willing to agree to cancel all</p>
<p>Subsidies and establish a three-article peace agreement. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau approved the original text of the agreement, which will be handed over to the Cotton Weaving Industry Association and the industrial unions. Amidst the surging waves of labor strikes, the cotton weaving industry workers are willing to cancel their existing conditions, which can be considered a model of labor-management cooperation. The original text of the agreement is recorded below: (1) The originally agreed upon labor-management conditions will remain in effect until the new conditions are revised. However, the factory is indeed experiencing poor business and is having difficulty sustaining itself. From the date of signing the agreement, the various subsidies stipulated in Articles 2 and 5 of the original conditions will be temporarily canceled. As for the yarn waiting subsidy in Article 6, the labor side expressed that it can be forgiven in fact. When the factory's business is truly restored to its original state, it will be submitted to the Bureau for approval and restoration. (2) The factory's request to reduce wages should not be discussed in view of the hardship of the workers. (3) The original methods of rewards and punishments will be cancelled for the time being. During the cancellation period, factory subsidies will still be allowed according to custom. Weaving workers will receive 30 cents of ocean money per month, and yarn shaking workers will receive 15 cents of ocean money per month for union dues. Attached are Articles 3, 5, and 6 of the original conditions. (4) The working hours are limited to ten hours and should not be wasted. If the factory needs to open night shifts, it is limited to three hours, and each person will be given 5 cents of ocean money for snacks in addition to wages. (5) In addition to handling meal money according to the old rules of each factory, weaving workers will receive an additional 50 cents of ocean money per month, and yarn shaking female workers will receive 30 cents of ocean money per month. (6) In case of waiting for warping and yarn doubling, the limit is three days. After three days, the factory will subsidize 25 cents of ocean money per day for work meals. If the workers do not go to the machine after three days, the work meal money will be deducted, but no further leave can be requested after three days, except in the case of natural disasters, illnesses, weddings, funerals, or special accidents.</p>

<p>Central Government Sends Personnel to Console and Coordinate a Resolution. The strike and factory shutdown dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Cooperative has been decided by the city government to be submitted to arbitration. The hunger-striking workers are still firmly refusing to eat. Lu Shiying was sent to the hospital due to her deteriorating condition. The central government has sent special personnel to Shanghai to console the workers and coordinate a resolution.</p>
<p>City Government Submits to Arbitration. Mayor Wu Tiecheng met with representatives of various labor unions the day before yesterday. When the representatives petitioned, the Mayor asked the representatives to meet again yesterday to talk. Yesterday afternoon, the representative Li Yongxiang and others went to the city government to await a reply. However, the Mayor was meeting with foreign guests, so he was represented by Secretary-General Yu. Yu replied that the city government has decided to submit the Sanyou factory incident to arbitration and has transferred it to the city party headquarters, the local court, etc. to nominate arbitration committee members. The city government has decided that Councilor Luo Panhui will serve as the chairman of the arbitration committee. It has been decided to submit it to arbitration within a week.</p>
<p>Workers with Serious Illness Sent to Hospital. Since the 18th when the worker Hong Jiaben and others announced a hunger strike, because the capitalist side showed no awareness, Sun Handong and others continued the hunger strike. Although representatives from various parties forcibly fed them a little milk, they have not eaten a grain of rice until now, and their spirits have become extremely weak and reached a dangerous situation. Yesterday morning around 5:00 AM, the hunger-striking worker Lu Shiying moaned repeatedly, and her condition was particularly serious. The union hired a car to forcibly send her to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Continuing to Set Off for Crying and Complaining. The Crying and Complaining delegation members Qi Weigen, Zhang Shiqi, and others, a total of 18 people, set off yesterday morning to the Chaozhou Shanghai Association, the China Women's National Salvation Federation, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Guangdong Provincial Association, the Sichuan Shanghai Association, the Citizens' Federation, the General Federation of Business Circles, the Hui Ning Shanghai Association, and other places to cry and complain about the pain of the workers. All sectors expressed sympathy and willingness to actively assist.</p>
<p>Meal Expenses Have Already Been Paid. The eighth installment of meal expenses for the workers, totaling 840 ocean dollars, should have been paid on Wednesday. The capitalist side made excuses to delay it for several days. Although the party and government agencies repeatedly negotiated, not only did they refuse to accept it, but they also made demands. Recently, in view of the tense atmosphere on all sides, the union representatives Xia Zhongzhao and Gong Zishen, together with Social Affairs Bureau representatives Wang Xianqing and Zhu Guilin, negotiated again at the Nanjing Road distribution office, and finally received the full amount.</p>
<p>Opinions of Central Government Representatives. The Central Party Department, in view of the labor-management dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Cooperative in Shanghai, which has been going on for a long time and has not been resolved, and that the workers have gone on hunger strike due to a lack of solutions, which is extremely pitiful, has sent Wu Zhongheng, the section chief of the Workers' Section of the Mass Movement Guidance Committee, and Zhang Jianbai to Shanghai, together with Shanghai-based investigator Jiang Hao, to the Sanyou Industrial Cooperative in Yinxianggang around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon to console the hunger-striking workers and persuade them to eat. They expressed to the hunger-striking workers that from the central government's perspective, whether from the standpoint of human feelings or the standpoint of the law, the central government believes that the capitalist side has no reason. Because the opening of a factory must be registered with the government, the closure of a factory should also be applied to the government for approval in advance. Whether to approve or not should be determined based on the situation. The expansion of the Hangzhou branch of the cooperative and the closure of the Shanghai general factory should not be possible. If these thousand workers lose their jobs, social panic will increase. Therefore, the central government ordered the Shanghai municipal government and the city party headquarters two weeks ago to force the capitalist side to resume work immediately. I, Wu, claim that after arriving in Shanghai, I immediately telegraphed the central government today, asking it to order the Shanghai party and government agencies to enforce the reply as soon as possible. The reply can arrive tomorrow. I am now in Shanghai and plan to immediately negotiate with the party and government agencies in this city to urge the capitalist side to come to its senses. I will also publish a statement of opinion to promote the capitalist side's awakening.</p>
<p>Cigarette Union Assistance. The Industrial Union of the Cigarette Industry in the Fourth District of this city convened an emergency representative meeting for the hunger strike of Sanyou workers. More than 100 representatives attended. Zhou Xuexiang was elected as the chairman. First, the chairman reported on the course of the Sanyou dispute and the hunger strike situation of the workers, and then discussed assistance methods: (1) Submit a petition to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government, ordering the capitalist side of the Sanyou Industrial Cooperative to open the factory immediately to maintain the livelihood of the workers. (2) If necessary, the factories affiliated with our union will strike to assist. (3) Order affiliated members to provide as much assistance as possible. (4) The secret meeting ended.</p>
<p>Refuting the Capitalist's Statement. The Cotton Weaving Industry Union in the Seventh District issued the following statement in response to the absurd wording of the statement issued by Ji Jiannan, the director of the distribution office of Sanyou Cooperative, as reported in the Starry Night News: (1) After the January 28th Shanghai War, the Yinxianggang location was not designated as a combat zone. When the Japanese army entered the factory on February 17th, they divided the factory into two sections, moving the machinery and assets in the factory to the front section and hiring Russian police to guard it. The empty rooms in the rear section were where the Japanese army was stationed, and the capitalist side was subsidized 30 ocean dollars per day to cover the cost of water and electricity. Since the factory was outside the war zone, how could the machinery have been bombed? (2) The products produced by the general factory are of many types, such as 透凉罗纱 (Tou Liang Luo Sha, cool gauze), single-width bed sheets, towel quilts, free cloth, large and small bath towels, and various household items, not just tablecloths and curtains, which are not necessities. (3) The highest price for free cloth is 38 cents. (4) The capitalist side's annual inventory is always worth more than 3 million yuan, which is a habitual compensation and not overproduction. According to the accountant's investigation report in June of this year, the inventory value was 1.9 million yuan. The shameless Ji Jiannan lied and acted as a tiger, and his despicable personality is indescribable. Fearing that the public does not understand the facts, we have issued this statement to clarify the facts. Cotton Weaving Industry Union, Seventh District.</p>
<p>Various Sectors Express Condolences. Yesterday, those who went to express condolences to the hunger-striking workers included Fu Huaichen, Li Jingyi, and Chen Xiaomei, representing the soap and medicine industry union of the Ninth District, bringing 12 cans of milk, Ge Hecai, representing the publishing industry union, and representatives of the military uniform industry union, all bringing letters of condolence and persuading the hunger-striking workers to resume eating. However, the members of the hunger strike delegation resolutely refused to resume eating.</p>

<p>Workers Hold Two Meetings Yesterday</p>
<p>Hiring Lawyers to Assist Those Arrested</p>
<p>The strike of the British Public Bus workers has not seen any new developments as of yesterday, and the situation remains precarious. Two general meetings were held yesterday, and many important cases were resolved. The details are recorded below. Two general meetings. Yesterday morning at 8:00, all the striking workers held a general meeting at the Renhe Tea House on Wuding Road. More than 120 people attended. The suicide squad reported on the work situation and resolved to fight to the death. In the afternoon at 5:00, a general meeting was held again at the same location, and many important cases were resolved. Due to strict secrecy, the content could not be ascertained.</p>
<p>Assistance to Those Arrested. The day before yesterday, one worker, No. 34, was detained by the French police, and at the same time, the Public Concession police also detained one worker, No. 199. The arrested workers are still in custody and will be sent to court for trial tomorrow. The strike committee has hired a lawyer to appear in court to defend them.</p>
<p>Assaulting New Workers. Yesterday morning at 10:00, a No. 9 Public Bus drove to the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Pingliang Road, and was suddenly surrounded by many workers, who severely beat the new ticket-selling worker on the bus. The worker was seriously injured and sent to the hospital for treatment by an ambulance dispatched by the police. The workers who caused the incident have escaped and have not been caught.</p>
<p>Gunfire Last Night. Around 8:00 last night, when a No. 10 Public Bus arrived at the Xinqiao Station of the Sampan Factory on Maigen Road, a person wearing short clothes suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, holding a handgun in his hand, and aimed at the driver on the bus and fired a shot. Fortunately, the driver was unusually alert, heard the gunshot, and knew there was an accident, so he leaned back, causing his head to violently hit the glass window on the front of the bus, shattering the glass, and injuring his face and other parts. The person who fired the gun went west and disappeared in an instant. The injured driver's name is Bai Yukun, a 23-year-old from Yangzhou. He was sent to the Renji Hospital for treatment by Patrolman No. 2040 from the Xin Zha Police Station who arrived after hearing the news. Court Trial. At 8:20 PM on the 19th of this month, a British Public Bus Company No. 9, No. 108 Public Bus, traveling from east to west from the French Concession of Aiduya Road, arrived at the Dongxinqiao Station. Four striking workers were waiting there for the vehicle to arrive, and went forward to make trouble. When the four people saw the No. 108 bus driving to the station, No. 8 Zhang Bojian opened the door. While the passengers were getting on and off, one person got on the bus and punched Zhang in the face without asking why. Zhang was confused and did not understand what was happening. He was forcibly dragged down and beaten by three accomplices, causing his clothes to be torn and his body injured. At that time, the passengers and others did not understand what was happening and could not resolve the situation. A passenger in the car, Patrolman No. 539 of the Public Concession, caught sight of the situation, got out of the car, and intervened. Zhang managed to escape. The perpetrators fled in a panic. The Indian patrolman chased and shouted, and the suspects ran south towards Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession. Two Chinese patrolmen, No. 144 and No. 577, from the French Police Station arrived after hearing the noise and helped to arrest one person. The other three escaped. The arrested person was taken to the police station along with Zhang. The chief first ordered Patrolman No. 69 to send Zhang to Renji Hospital. After the doctor confirmed that the injury was minor, he applied medicine and left the hospital. Zhang returned to the police station, reported the assault, and requested an investigation. The chief questioned the defendant, who gave his name as Huo Zhongshan, a 26-year-old from Shandong, living in a shed on Wuding Road, Gorden Road. He was a ticket seller in the public bus company and denied the assault. He did not know the names of the three people who escaped, only knowing their numbers as No. 2, No. 34, and No. 278 ticket sellers. After the chief of the investigation section of the French Police Station, Xi, was able to determine that No. 2 was Tang Dongshan, living at No. 361 Yangzhou Road, No. 34 was Xuan Hengchang, living at No. 503 Tongji Road, Tiantong'an Road, and No. 278 was Li Rujiang, living at No. 1003 Hede Road. He immediately reported to the Second Special Court, signed an arrest warrant, and sent police officers and detectives to arrest them at their addresses. Tang had already escaped, and only Li Rujiang was caught. It was also found that Xuan Hengchang's original address had been moved during the war this spring, and his whereabouts were unknown. He escaped after the incident on the 19th. The next night (20th) at 8:00, he was arrested again in the Public Concession on Xin Zha Road for throwing stones at a public bus and was detained at the Xin Zha Police Station. He was immediately taken to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Special District Court for investigation. In the afternoon at 3:00, Judge Wang Gangxu was promoted to the criminal court to conduct a preliminary hearing. First, Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the police station, briefly stated the case, stating that the police station is now prosecuting according to Articles 158, 161, 197, 218, and 382 of the Criminal Law, disrupting order, endangering public security, damaging other people's property, and obstructing freedom, etc. However, the police station's procedures have not been completed, and a request is made to postpone the hearing for one week and allow the defendant to be temporarily detained. It was also stated that the police station received a report from the bus company today that the defendants had committed theft, but the police station has not yet investigated and prosecuted. Then, the plaintiff Zhang Bojian described the assault, but he could not remember the faces of the perpetrators because he was beaten and confused at the time. The official asked if he had any scars on his body, whether he had been treated, and whether he needed to be examined now. Zhang replied that he was treated at Renji Hospital at the time, and there was a medical certificate at the police station, but he is now fine and does not need to be examined. According to Indian Patrolman No. 539's testimony, he clearly saw the first defendant beating the plaintiff first, followed by the second and third defendants beating him together. When questioned, the defendant Huo Zhongshan stated, "At that time, I got off the No. 5 bus and walked south. I heard someone shouting 'robber' and was arrested. I did not commit the assault. I only sold tickets for a month in the public bus company. This time, six representatives initiated a request for the company to increase wages without getting a share of profit, which led to the strike." Li and Xuan also denied the assault. At this point, the official asked the witness, Indian Patrolman No. 539, "When they were beating him, did you see clearly whether the defendants were present?" The answer was, "I saw it clearly with my own eyes." The question was, "Can you guarantee it?" The answer was, "I can." He was then ordered to sign the guarantee. The court then announced that the hearing would be postponed and the defendants would be returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Shuang Gong Silk Factory Labor Dispute Resolved <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Wages Increased by One Cent Per Day</p>
<p>Factory Has Set a Date to Resume Work Tomorrow</p>
<p>Workers at the Fulunheng Shuang Gong Silk Factory at the end of Tianbin Road in Hongkou suddenly went on strike on the 19th. After several days of direct negotiations between labor and management representatives, a significant result was achieved yesterday. The factory has decided to resume operations tomorrow, and the union has also ordered workers to return to the factory at that time. The details are recorded below: Cause of the Strike. The Fulunheng Shuang Gong Silk Factory has a total of 216 silk reeling machines. Manager Shen Zupei, seeing that most of the Shuang Gong silk factories in the city have closed down and the price of Shuang Gong silk has slightly recovered, in order to meet market sales needs, specially modified 108 of the original single-eye silk reeling machines (i.e., each machine reels only one piece of silk) into double-eye machines (i.e., each machine reels two pieces of silk) in early July. The wages of the workers on the double-eye machines were increased to 45 cents, while the wages of the remaining 108 single-eye machine workers remained at 42 cents per day and were not increased. As a result, some workers expressed dissatisfaction and suddenly went on strike at 1:00 PM last Friday, and all the workers in the factory joined the strike.</p>
<p>Mediation Process. After the strike occurred, the workers immediately sent more than ten representatives to report to the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union and requested negotiations with the capitalist to increase wages and improve treatment. The union sent directors Chen Xipou and Zhu Xizhang, and cadre Lu Xusheng, to negotiate with the capitalist representative Shen Zupei. After repeated negotiations and consultations, an agreement was reached at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 22nd). The result was that the wages of the single-eye machine workers were increased by one cent per day to 43 cents, and the wages of the double-eye machine workers remained at 45 cents. Any differences in the price of silver were calculated in ocean dollars. Working hours should be handled in accordance with the rules of the Dan Gong silk factory. The labor and management representatives expressed their agreement, and the strike was resolved.</p>
<p>Resuming Work Tomorrow. After the labor and management negotiations reached an agreement, the union found it difficult to notify all the workers who were scattered in various places in a timely manner. After consultation with the capitalist, it was decided to resume operations tomorrow (the 24th) morning. The union also notified all workers to return to work at that time. It is reported that the union has assigned personnel to be present at the factory when work resumes to maintain order.</p>

<p>Rejecting Demands</p>
<p>The entire group of delivery workers at the Da Gong She, Yun Da Bei Da, and Eastern Pacific three telegram bureaus, due to demands for improved treatment and increased wages, sent a letter to the company manager on the 16th of this month, presenting six conditions, with a deadline for a reply yesterday. The company authorities, yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, officially replied in writing, rejecting all the conditions proposed by the workers. However, the workers do not seem to be going on strike immediately. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Company's Reply: After the Da Bei Da, Eastern Pacific three telegram bureaus received the letter from the delivery workers requesting improved treatment and increased wages, they gave a written reply yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM as follows: "To our respected colleagues, regarding your letter of the 19th of this month, written in block letters, in addition to what has already been explained verbally, we now specifically certify as follows: that our company's concern for the generous wages issue is as always, we are willing to begin an investigation. As for the results of the investigation, we will notify you within a reasonable period of time. At the same time, this company would like to solemnly state that the actions you are about to take are indeed dangerous and would like to solemnly warn you, that you are taking a significant risk, losing your current good job, generous wages, rice price subsidies, monthly bonuses, annual bonuses, sick leave wages, annual leave, and old-age subsidies, etc." This is addressed to all delivery workers of the Da Bei Telegraph Company, respectfully from Bolsen, by order of the General Manager. Also, the letter addressed to the Eastern workers was signed by Manager Bolade, and the content is the same as the letter above.</p>
<p>Workers' Statement: According to a statement issued by a responsible person from the workers' side to the Da Gong She reporter, "The company's so-called generous wages are only 29 yuan per month, and the lowest amount is only 18 yuan. As for the rice price subsidy, it only applies when the rice price reaches 14 yuan or more, and the company subsidizes one yuan. This amount is very small each day, at most one yuan per month, and as little as six or seven jiao of silver. The company has never issued bonuses. Workers' annual leave is only granted for one week per year after working for three full years; otherwise, it is not allowed. As for old-age subsidies, there are no regulations at all. The reply says, etc., are all fabricated facts, terms that obscure the outside world. The workers' vital interests are at stake, and in order to demand improved treatment, we are determined to take effective action to prompt the company authorities to realize this," etc.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Liaison Office of the Northeast National Salvation Army received two telegrams yesterday as follows: (1) Shanhai Pass, 21st: "It is heard that dozens of miles of track along the Tongliao Yamenying section of the Datong line have been demolished by the volunteer army. Trains heading north only reach Zhangwu. During the battle at Baiqizhai on the railway ridge on the morning of the 13th, the residents suffered heavy losses due to fierce bombing by Japanese aircraft. The Jinshan troops once retreated but plan to counterattack. After destroying enemy transportation routes, the various units of the National Salvation Army have separately gathered along the railway lines and are ready to act at any time. The troops under the command of the First Route Commander, Jin Yuming, are spread between Dahushan and Juliuhe on the pseudo-Fengshan Road. The derailment of the Baiqibao train on the afternoon of the 19th was carried out by this unit. Jin himself entered the pass previously due to business. Now, due to the tense work in the front, he hastily returned to the defense on the evening of the 20th." August 22 (2) Shanhai Pass, 21st: "Zhu Wuqing, Chief Supervisor and Central Committee Member of the National Salvation Army, left Tianjin in the dead of night ten days ago and went out of the pass again. Zhu worked extremely hard raising funds and ammunition in Beijing and Shanghai. After returning north, he rushed to make a new combat plan for his troops. Overworked, his health deteriorated. Many around him advised him to rest for a while, but Zhu said that the fighting in the front was taking place during the hot summer months, and he should not cherish his body. He resolutely went east. Ji Yuzheng, Ren Fangqiu, Wei Shimin, Fu Diancou, Li Ziyang, Bai Riqing, etc., and the troops under Li Du and Ding Chao have made contact in various areas of Jiha and will take fierce actions. On the morning of the 16th, Bai Riqing's troops destroyed bridges, demolished tracks, and cut telephone lines between Longtanshan and Jiangmifeng on the Jidun Road. A train passing through was derailed as a result. Dozens of Japanese train crew members and guards were captured. Traffic has been cut off for several days." August 22</p>

<h3 id="e141">Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association Urges Donations for Northeast Volunteer Army <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>To Be a Pioneer Among Fellow Villagers Associations in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai urged fellow villagers to donate to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army in an urgent circular, saying: "The Northeast has been lost for nearly a year. The government makes empty promises of resistance and watches as it is ravaged. Our Northeast Volunteer Army, unable to bear the destruction of our country and people, can only resist with blood and flesh. They advance wave upon wave, regarding death as homecoming. Their indomitable spirit, hardship, and grief are such that, unless one is utterly heartless, how can one bear to stand by and not help? The people in various parts of our country cannot share the hardships of the Northeast Volunteer Army, but if they do not provide economic assistance, how different are they from those who stand by and do nothing? Moreover, with the ambition of the Japanese bandits, if the Northeast is lost, other provinces will also be difficult to defend. If we are regarded as the people of Yue by the people of Qin, we will eventually perish together. It must be known that the enemy is brutal. Once conquered, wives will become concubines, sons will become slaves, and fields and property will be at their disposal. At that time, even if you possess vast wealth, it will be difficult to protect. Even if you can protect it, what use will it be? Directly, it is difficult to save others, indirectly, it is saving oneself. Our association uses special sincerity to urge our fellow villagers in Shanghai to enthusiastically donate to relieve the disaster together. Our fellow villagers in Shanghai are mostly patriotic and enthusiastic. If donations are received, please send them to the association immediately for remittance. Do not think that a drop in the bucket is of no use. You should know that the whole fur comes from one armpit and can be used to make it. If each fellow villagers association in Shanghai promotes it, if every resident of Shanghai donates money, so that the Northeast Volunteer Army is well-fed and armed, and has many soldiers and sufficient equipment to continue resistance, and slightly delay the fate of the country, then among our 400 million Chinese, there will surely be heroes who rise up to lead the people to recover the lost rivers and mountains. The survival of the nation and race depends on this. Loosen your purse strings and make contributions; this is the time." This is specially announced. August 15, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e143">National Coal Freight Rate Increase Postponed for Another Three Months <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The National Mining Federation, considering that the cost of domestic coal is relatively high and cannot compete with Japanese coal, specially petitioned the Ministry of Railways to request a reduction in freight rates, but failed to obtain approval. The Ministry of Railways took advantage of the slack summer freight season to increase coal transport plan, but coal merchants were unable to realize this plan due to capital constraints. In order to encourage the production and sales of domestic coal, the Ministry of Railways specially extended the freight rate increase for another three months.</p>
<p>Reduction of Freight Rates Not Approved: The Ministry of Railways replied to the National Mining Federation's petition for a reduction in freight rates, saying that the main reason for the higher cost of coal mines operated by Chinese is the outdated production tools and poor technology, which has nothing to do with freight rates. The way to rescue them is to innovate production tools and technology; otherwise, simply reducing freight rates will be difficult to achieve. On the railway side, the current freight rates are not enough to make a profit. If they are reduced further, they will not be enough to maintain the road.</p>
<p>Increase in Coal Transport Not Successful: Since November of last year, the Ministry of Railways ordered all railway bureaus to temporarily suspend the price increase for three months, and subsequently extended the period repeatedly. Therefore, although it did not agree to reduce freight rates, it set another plan, ordering all railway bureaus to take advantage of the slack summer freight season to increase coal transport, and separately ordered all coal merchants to take advantage of this period of suspended freight rate increases to transport coal widely in order to avoid difficulties with vehicles in the winter. Now that the summer is about to end, coal merchants have encountered difficulties in terms of capital and time and have been unable to increase coal transport. The Coal Industry Guild has replied to the railway bureau by letter, stating the difficult situation, already reported in various newspapers, that the planned plan cannot be realized.</p>
<p>Freight Rate Increase Postponed: Since the plan to transport coal in the summer failed, and the suspension period is about to expire, the Ministry of Railways believes that it is necessary to postpone the increase again in order to rescue domestic coal merchants. It specially telegraphed all railway bureaus, ordering them to extend the period for another three months from this month. The railway bureau's document stated: "Since the East Province Incident occurred last year, various places have boycotted the import of Japanese coal, and the supply of domestic coal has fallen short of demand. In order to encourage the production and sales of domestic coal and relieve the coal shortage in the Yangtze River, the Ministry temporarily suspended the increase in coal transport rates on all roads for three months. It is estimated that the Jiaoji Railway implemented this on November 1st of last year, and the Jinghu, Huhangyong, Qingnanxun, Xiang'e, Pingsui, Longhai, Jinpu, Pinghan, and other eight roads implemented this on November 21st of last year. Since then, the periods have expired repeatedly, and the Ministry has repeatedly extended them and ordered compliance. Now, in order to relieve domestic coal and resist the dumping of Japanese coal, the Ministry will continue to extend the period for another three months from the 1st and 21st of this month (omitted below)."</p>
<h3 id="e144">International Trade Bureau Investigates National Industries <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>First Investigate Five Provinces, Estimated Completion in Two Years</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province's Investigation Has Been Completed in Several Counties After Implementation</p>
<p>In order to understand the situation of national industries and seek fundamental relief, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially launched a national industry survey, ordering the Shanghai International Trade Bureau to be responsible for the implementation. The bureau has recently complied with the order and is sending personnel to first investigate the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei, and Hebei, and then go to other places for investigation. It is estimated that the investigation of the five provinces will be completed in two years. At that time, a special volume will be published. The industry in the entire Jiangsu province is under investigation. Director He Bingxian gave an important speech to the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday regarding this matter, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation Area: The International Trade Bureau received the order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce one month ago. At that time, Director He immediately proceeded actively and planned the detailed methods for this matter. It was decided to investigate the five provinces of Su, Zhejiang, Yue, E, and Ji within the national territory, and among the five provinces, to first engage in the investigation of Jiangsu province. Since the tenth of this month, investigators have been dispatched to various parts of Su province to proceed. Because of the public's full support, the investigation is progressing smoothly. As of yesterday, the places that have been investigated include Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Longtan, Nanjing, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Jintan, Changshu, Ze, Wujiang, Chuansha, Lili, and Lishui. It is estimated that the entire Jiangsu province can be investigated completely within three months, and the Chinese report will be published in November, and the English report will be published in December.</p>
<p>Investigation Personnel: The specialists for investigating national industries, Zhao Jian and Xiao Guozou, two staff members from the Statistics Section of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, worked together with the investigation specialists from the International Trade Bureau, Hou Houpei, Lu Guoxiang, Feng Hefa, Xie Ze, Yao Fangren, Jiang Xuekai, Ma Jibo, etc. They worked together, and Hou Houpei was recommended as the director. Currently, all of them have been dispatched to various places to engage in the investigation.</p>
<p>Investigation Types: The types of investigation are as follows: (1) Agricultural Economic Investigation, divided as follows: A. Total area of the county and soil rainfall, classification of farming households, etc., B. Agricultural workers, agricultural capital, agricultural tools, E. Cooperatives, (2) Investigation of Household Industries Attached to Farm Households: A. Main producing areas, B. Annual output, G. Raw materials used, D. Source of raw materials, E. Production season, F. Manufacturing aspects, G. Uses H. Application equipment, I. Price per unit, J. Trading habits K. Business organization, M. Main sales locations, N. Taxes, O. Improvements and others, (3) Industrial Investigation: A. Factory name, B. Organization, C. Capital, D. Number of employees, E. Source of workers, F. Work efficiency, G. Raw materials, H. Production situation, I. Sales market J. Equipment description, (4) Investigation of Financial Insurance and Warehousing Industries: A. Name, B. Establishment date, C. Category, D. Organizational nature, E. Capital, F. Public reserve fund, G. Main business, H. Annual turnover, (5) General Economic Situation Investigation: A. History of merchants, B. Currency in circulation, C. Annual import and export goods, (6) Investigation of Materials and Raw Materials: A. Animals and plants and their products, B. Reading materials (the above are general outlines). Director He Discusses: A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Director He Bingxian yesterday. According to the discussion, this investigation of national industries by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is an unprecedented move in our country's construction cause. This is because our country has never conducted an investigation of national industries before. Twenty years ago, Japan published a book specifically about the industrial investigation of our country. However, it has been a long time since then, and it is different from the current situation. The purpose of this investigation, in general, is: (1) Internally, our country's industries are declining and urgently need to seek relief methods. However, in order to seek remedies, we must understand the industrial situation in various parts of the country, so that we know where the shortcomings are, so that we can determine the direction for improvement based on the situation of the national industrial economy. (2) Externally, to make the countries of the world understand the economic and commercial situation of China. At the same time, if there are countries that want to investigate the situation in China, they can also use this to answer. Because one of the most difficult points at present is that foreigners who observe China often ask about the industrial situation and have no way to answer. As for this investigation of the five provinces, it is estimated that it will be completed within two years. Afterwards, other provinces will be investigated.</p>

<p>Lou Xiangqing of Tianjin sent a telegram to Zhu Qinglan, saying: "General Zhu, Qian Junjun from Changchun telegraphed that the floods in Songhei and both rivers are extremely severe. Currently, the Charity National Body plans to establish a flood relief association in Harbin. I dare to beg you to treat everyone equally and vigorously raise funds to benefit the afflicted, etc. I believe that Jihei is our country's land, and the victims are our compatriots. At this time, foreign troubles are rampant, and the great flood has suddenly arrived. The disasters of Heaven and man are hot. In the past, the disasters in Lu, Ji, Shan, Yu, Qin, and Jin, and the provinces along the Yangtze River were severe, and the three northeastern provinces raised a lot of food and money. According to the righteousness of reciprocity, we must not ignore this. I beg you to transfer the matter to the Central Business Council and Minister Song, Chairman Xu, and the China Jisheng Association and other charities, especially to set up and allocate huge sums of money to provide relief as soon as possible, and to imply the intention of appeasing the border people. I cannot bear to wait for the reply. The method of dispersing the relief seems to be able to be handled by Yang Zigong, a member of the charity association in his four provinces, nearby, or by Junren at his discretion, but it is still awaiting your consideration." Lou Xiangqing respects.</p>

<p>Supporting the Implementation Committee of the Two-Eight System</p>
<p>Preventing Foremen and Others from Designing Slander</p>
<p>Wu Xiangxi and 393 other representatives of pier workers in Shanghai issued a declaration to support the Implementation Committee of the Two-Eight System and prevent foremen and others from designing slander, saying: "To all party, government, and social figures across the country: Recently, foremen Jia Boxin and Sun Tiehai, falsely using the name of Shanghai pier workers, published an unsigned and irresponsible announcement in the Shen Xin newspapers, slandering our workers' character and undermining our workers' reputation under the pretext of supporting the foremen. It is infuriating to read. (Omitted in the middle) Fortunately, there is the Implementation Committee of the Two-Eight System, which has been fighting hard for more than a month. The committee is not only the only organization to protect the interests of our workers, but also a legitimate organization approved by the party and government authorities for filing. The responsible committee members are all genuine pier workers and staff members of the trade union. In principle, our workers are willing to wholeheartedly support this organization, which truly represents the interests of the workers. The head can be cut off and the body can be killed, but this genuine organization representing the interests of the workers will never be allowed to be destroyed. We now accept the advice of the central and local party and government agencies and wait quietly for a fair decision. We will not disturb public order in the slightest, and we are willing to strictly abide by the order. All actions will not go beyond the scope of the law, but after this, if there are riots on the docks or other illegal activities, it must be designed and harmed by the foremen, and our two-eight system committee will not be responsible. In order to prevent problems before they occur, in addition to reporting the situation to the party and government agencies for filing, we also ask them to sympathize with the hardship of the workers and provide assistance to achieve the goal of implementing the two-eight system in order to meet the expectations of the workers. This is fortunate. This is declared."</p>
<h3 id="e148">Zheng Baozhao Discusses Railway Responsible Transportation <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Coordinating with the Principle of People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Seeking Happiness for the Entire Society</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways' implementation of responsible transportation this time is related to the national economy, and its significance is extremely important. The Jinpu, Jinghu, and Huhangyong roads have been set to implement this from September 1st. The reporter specially inquired about the personal opinions of Zheng Baozhao, director of the car affairs department of the two roads. Now he has given the following speech: "According to the general situation of railway responsible transportation, I have briefly discussed a few points in the last speech. Now I will further discuss the relationship between railway responsibility and merchants, manufacturing industries, and all aspects of society. First, the railway implements responsible transportation.</p>
<p>After the goods are delivered, the railway is fully responsible along the way. Merchants can save the trouble of various procedures and avoid unexpected losses. Merchants can use the bill of lading issued by the railway to mortgage it to the bank. Since the bank knows that the railway is responsible, it will be happy to accept it. The financial aspect can be extra circulated, and merchants can also rely on financial circulation to increase trade and adequately operate. Moreover, the goods are transported by the railway, which can eliminate the illegal commissions of intermediaries caused by the railway's irresponsibility in the past. The cost of goods transportation can be reduced compared to before. Second, regarding the manufacturing industry, due to the reduction in transportation costs, sales are becoming more and more widespread, and the amount of production can be increased at a high speed. According to economic principles, the wider the production, the lower the cost per unit of production (Perunttcosi). This is mutually causal, and industry and commerce can be developed extraordinarily. Third, in terms of society, the development of industry and commerce requires more and more workers. Workers can have work to do, which can solve part of the unemployment panic. Social order can become tranquil, and the number of production increases. The cost of production and transportation is reduced, and the market goods, according to the law of supply and demand, must fall in price. The people in society can obtain inexpensive goods, increase the purchasing power of money, and gradually reduce the level of living. This is in line with the Prime Minister's principle of people's livelihood. Therefore, responsible transportation is for the sake of happiness for the entire society and is not for the benefit of a few people. As for increasing the freight rate by 10%, it is only to compensate for the losses after responsibility and to add the need for employee equipment. It is completely different from the general increase in freight rates. Moreover, before the implementation of responsible transportation, the illegal commissions borne by the merchants often accounted for more than 20% to 30% of the freight. This time, we have cleared up the accumulated malpractices, and the increase is only 10%. It is obvious which one gets the better deal. At the beginning of this implementation, I urgently hope that all parties will give assistance so that there will be satisfactory results," and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e149">National Railway Freight Car Transportation Regulations (Continued) <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Article 28: Changes in the Calculation of Freight Charges. In the event of a change as described in Article 24, freight charges shall be calculated according to the following items, and any difference or surplus in the freight charges already collected shall be collected or refunded separately: (1) Interrupted transportation: When requesting interrupted transportation, the freight for the section already transported shall be collected. (2) Change of destination station: For goods whose destination station is changed, if the goods must be transported forward or backward from the station where the goods are located, or if they must enter another line, the freight calculation method shall be as follows: first, add the mileage between the original departure station and the station where the goods are located to the mileage between the station where the goods are located and the newly designated destination station, and then calculate the freight according to the total mileage. (3) Return to the original station: When returning to the original station, the freight for the distance already traveled and the return trip shall be collected according to the schedule. Article 29: Changes in the calculation of miscellaneous freight charges. The following miscellaneous charges and expenses incurred due to changes shall be calculated separately: (1) Loading and unloading fees incurred due to changes. (2) When canceling consignment, the storage fee for the goods from the time the goods storage receipt is issued until the time the goods are taken out. However, if the first consignment is canceled and the goods are not moved out of the yard, and it is stated that the goods will still be consigned within 24 hours, the storage fee may be waived. However, for the second cancellation of consignment, regardless of whether the consignment is continued or not, the storage fee shall be calculated from the time the goods are moved into the freight yard until the time the goods are moved out or the consignment is continued. (3) When stopping loading, the detention fee for the vehicle from the time the vehicle is allocated until the time the railway receives the notice to stop loading (every hour or less than an hour shall be calculated according to the vehicle's load capacity, with one dime of ocean silver collected for each metric ton, including day and night). (4) In the event of interrupted transportation, the storage fee for the goods, the detention fee for the vehicle, and the switching fee (a total of two yuan of ocean silver shall be collected for the switching fee for each vehicle that is disconnected midway) from the time of stopping until the departure station receives other change notices. (5) All expenses incurred in the handling of Article 26. Article 30: Calculation of freight and miscellaneous charges for goods delayed in transit. In the event of a natural disaster or accident that causes a delay in railway transportation and cannot be restored within the shortest period, the railway shall immediately investigate and determine that goods that have been prepared for shipment and must pass through the disaster-stricken area shall not be loaded. If the goods have already been loaded and the fees have been collected, the consignor shall be notified to unload the goods, and the full freight shall be refunded, except for the miscellaneous fees that should be collected. Regardless of whether the goods have been loaded or not, if the consignor requests to transport the goods to a certain station that does not pass through the disaster-stricken area and there are still trains passing through, the railway may still transport the goods, but the difference between the freight already collected and the freight to the newly designated destination station shall be calculated and collected or refunded separately. In the event of the disaster described in the preceding paragraph, if the goods have been transported to a midway station and are detained, the railway shall immediately notify the consignor and inquire about the disposal method of the goods, and handle them separately according to the following methods: (1) If the consignor requests to continue transportation as soon as traffic is restored, it must be determined by the railway that the transportation is indeed likely to be restored in the shortest period. (2) If the consignor requests to return the goods to the original departure station, the railway shall return the goods free of charge and refund all the freight it has collected. (3) If the consignor requests to transport the goods to a certain station (not the original departure station), the railway shall calculate the difference between the freight from the original departure station to the originally designated destination station and the freight from the original departure station to the newly designated destination station, and collect or refund the difference separately. (4) If the consignor requests to unload the goods at the midway station, the railway shall refund the freight for the un-transported distance, and all miscellaneous fees required for stopping or changing transportation at the midway station shall not be collected. However, the request in item 4 shall be subject to approval by the railway, and the fees in items 1, 2, and 3 shall be calculated and collected in accordance with the regulations. Article 31: Inspection of Goods. When goods transported by the railway are delivered to the destination station, if the consignee believes that there is a suspicion of loss or damage to the goods, they may request the railway to inspect them and pay the inspection fee in accordance with the regulations. However, if the railway is responsible for the loss or damage of the goods, the inspection fee may be waived. If the railway discovers that the goods are lost, damaged, or have suspicious traces, it shall request the consignee or consignor to inspect them together, and the inspection fee shall be waived. However, the railway may also conduct inspections directly when necessary and notify the consignor or consignee of the inspection results. Article 32: Goods Unclaimed or Refused by the Consignee. If goods are transported to the destination station and no one claims them, or if the consignee refuses to accept them, the railway may temporarily store the goods in the freight yard and collect storage fees (if the goods are damaged due to railway negligence and the consignee refuses to accept them, the damaged goods may be exempted from storage fees, but the undamaged goods shall still be subject to storage fees), and handle them separately according to the following items: (1) If the goods have been transported to the destination station for more than ten days and no one has claimed them, or if the consignee refuses to accept the goods, the railway shall immediately notify the consignor and inquire about the disposal method of the goods. However, for items that are easily perishable or goods of particularly low value that the railway believes are insufficient to guarantee the freight and miscellaneous fees that should be paid, the railway may sell them at auction or dispose of them by other methods at any time. (3) If the consignee comes to claim the goods before the consignor's response to the above notice is received, the original goods shall be delivered, and the consignor shall be notified again (to be continued).</p>

<p>Hubei Province Sends Steamer to Shanghai to Receive the Coffin</p>
<p>Mr. Tian Ziqin, a veteran of the Kuomintang and former member of the National Government, passed away at sea due to overwork in July two years ago. When the Central Government heard of this, it was extremely shocked. The Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, in recognition of Mr. Tian's contributions to the Party and the country, ordered Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun by telegram to lower the flag to mourn and to discuss preferential treatment. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, upon hearing the news at the front, ordered Shanghai Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui to assist in handling the funeral. Furthermore, the 118th Central Standing Committee passed a resolution for a public burial and instructed the Executive Yuan to order the Hubei Provincial Government to handle the matter. After receiving the order, the provincial government, together with Mr. Tian Huan, Mr. Tian Ziqin's brother, surveyed and designated Hongshan in Wuchang as the burial site. They also organized the Hubei Provincial Government Preparatory Committee for the Public Burial of Mr. Tian Ziqin, with members of the provincial government as ex officio members. The tomb construction project was designed by the Construction Department, and the project was quite extensive and the design magnificent. The mountain terrain was grand and the scenery beautiful, making it an unprecedented mausoleum in Hubei Province. The public burial was originally scheduled for November last year, but it was postponed to this spring due to the flood. It was then postponed again due to the Japanese invasion of Shanghai. Recently, President of the Judicial Yuan Ju Zheng formally telegraphed the Hubei authorities, inviting Tian Huanmin back to Hubei to discuss the matter with Director He Chengjun, Chairman Xia Douyin, Chairman of the Public Burial Committee Zhu Huaibing, and Vice Chairman Kong Geng. It has now been decided that the public burial will take place at Shen Shi (3-5 PM) on September 20. The Hubei government will send a special steamer to Shanghai to receive the coffin. It is expected that the steamer will depart around the 10th of next month. As Mr. Tian was a veteran of the Kuomintang, there will definitely be grand and solemn activities at that time.</p>

<p>Since the Anhui Finance Director came to Shanghai to contact banks for loans, the Shanghai Anhui Businessmen's Association and other groups such as the Anhui Fellow Villagers Association have held meetings one after another to discuss countermeasures. The Anhui Businessmen's Association believes that this matter is closely related to the interests of the people of Anhui and cannot be ignored. Yesterday, they also telegraphed Wu Liqing, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting a thorough investigation. The original telegram stated, (title omitted) "Since you, Mr. Chairman, took charge of provincial affairs, the people of Anhui have been fortunate enough to have their taxes reduced. Unexpectedly, news has spread that the Finance Department has privately issued provincial bonds, increasing the burden on the people of Anhui, which even warlords would not dare to do, placing the people of Anhui in a situation of eternal doom. Today, our association respectfully represents 30 million people in Anhui and raises a serious question to you, Mr. Chairman. Were you involved in this bond issuance? Was it approved by the provincial government meeting? What is the purpose? What is the collateral? We hope that you will conduct a fair and thorough investigation and announce the truth. The people of Anhui will be very fortunate." The Shanghai Anhui Businessmen's Association respectfully kowtows.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Shanghai Anti-Smoking Hospital Opened Yesterday <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Xinwei Relief Society has been working hard to carry out active relief work and has specially established the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Hospital. Preparations for the opening have been reported in previous newspapers. On the morning of the 21st, the hospital held its official opening ceremony. Those present that day included Vice Chairman Wang Yiting, Standing Directors Wen Lanting, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Yunong, Director Xu Jingren, Representative Huang Bodu, Dean Chen Aishi, Vice Dean and Medical Director Song Qiluo, and Mr. Hu Hongji, representative of Mayor Wu, heads of various agencies, representatives of various organizations, and leaders and celebrities from all walks of life, totaling more than one hundred and dozens of people. At the time, rituals were performed as usual. First, Dean Chen reported on the preparations. Many guests gave speeches that day, all expressing their expectations. The speech by Dean Ying of the Second Special District Court was particularly moving, and the speech by Standing Director Qu Wenliu was the most profound and sincere, briefly stating that the establishment of the anti-smoking hospital by the association is entirely for charitable purposes, to save poor and blacklisted compatriots. Doctors and staff must be kind and compassionate, treating patients like fathers and brothers treat their children and like loving mothers treat their infants. If the handling is not done properly, it would betray the original intention of the association and would be subject to social criticism. He hoped that all members of the hospital would work hard to eliminate smoking, etc. The hospital is located at 476 Haig Road, a quiet place with lush flowers and trees, fresh air, clean rooms, and complete equipment. The doctors hired are all experienced and well-versed, using scientific methods to eliminate bad habits without pain in a short period of time. There are also special wards that are particularly elegant and the fees are extremely low. If there are poor and blacklisted compatriots who are determined to quit smoking, they can find a reliable guarantor to quit smoking for free, but the guarantor must guarantee that they will not relapse. Those who are determined to quit smoking should not miss this rare opportunity.</p>

<p>The Minhang Yacht Club held its scheduled race on Saturday and Sunday. There was only one race on Saturday and two races on Sunday. The race situation is recorded below. In the race on Saturday, only three yachts participated: (He Dafu) driving yacht No. 3, (Hua Tuosheng) No. 4, and (Xiang Liansheng) No. 6. At 3:40 PM, the flag was raised at the starting line (Puhua Garden) and the yachts set off. No. 3 crossed the starting line first, followed closely by No. 6, and No. 4 was the last to set off. No. 3 passed the first marker on the Pudong bank downstream, turned to the second marker on the opposite bank, and then returned upstream, crossed the starting line, and reached the third marker, and then turned back to the starting line to finish. Nos. 6 and 4 never caught up. Therefore, the gold medal (a silver cup) was awarded to He Dafu. The first race on Sunday started at 12 noon. Six yachts participated: (Hai Si) driving No. 3, (Hua Tuosheng) No. 4, (Xiang Shouze) No. 6, (Wang Yanqing) No. 9, (Gu Chongqing) No. 10, and (A Tuojin Si) No. 11. At the sound of the order, No. 6 crossed the starting line first, followed closely by No. 3, then No. 10 and No. 9. Unexpectedly, No. 9 collided with No. 10, resulting in disqualification. At this time, No. 3 overtook No. 6, with Nos. 10, 4, and 11 behind. No. 6 was disqualified for touching the first marker. However, the wind was extremely light at this time, and yachts Nos. 10, 4, 11, and 3 could not reach the second marker, resulting in their disqualification midway. Only yacht No. 3 was driven properly and reached the finish line. The second race on Sunday started at 3:30 PM. The participants were (Hai Si) driving No. 3, (Hua Tuosheng) No. 4, (Xiang Shouze) No. 6, A Tuojin Si) No. 9, (Gu Caiwen) No. 10, and (Gu Chongqing) No. 11. In the sound of the police whistle, Nos. 6 and 11 drove side by side in the lead. Soon, No. 11 overtook No. 6 and reached the first marker, followed by Nos. 6, 9, and 10, while Nos. 4 and 3 fell behind. After passing the third marker, No. 10 rushed out, and Nos. 9, 6, and 11 went side by side. However, at the finish line, the bow of No. 10 exceeded No. 11 by about a foot in an instant. The results were most exciting at this time. Amidst the applause of the audience, the gold medal was awarded to Mr. Gu Caiwen.</p>

<p>The woman Hu Shen, 29 years old, and her husband, Hu Haigen, opened a Xiecheng Fruit Store at 213 Chengdu Road. The couple usually got along very well. The day before yesterday, the two quarreled over economic matters. Mrs. Hu was resentful and despondent and had thoughts of ending her life. She secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. Her husband noticed and sent her to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and she died shortly after. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Felling Road. Yesterday morning, Zhan Liangce, prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Local Court, arrived at the office to examine the body. After examination, he took a public case and questioned Hu Haigen, who testified that the deceased was his wife and that he did have a slight quarrel with her the day before yesterday over money matters, and that she suddenly took poison. Mr. Zhan, upon receiving the confession, announced that the deceased, Hu Shen, female, had indeed died from opium poisoning during her lifetime. The body was handed over to her husband, Hu Haigen, to be coffined and buried after he made a statement.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Yun Huifang Case Not Heard Yesterday <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Police Lodge an Appeal Against Bail</p>
<p>High Court Summoned the Entire Case File</p>
<p>Therefore, the Trial Could Not Proceed Yesterday</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhao Chen Speaks on the Appeal</p>
<p>Yun Huifang was prosecuted by the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works to the First Special District Local Court for using letter bombs to warn unscrupulous merchants who sold enemy goods, and was granted bail after a guarantee was provided by the business. Yesterday morning was the third scheduled hearing of the case. The Police Department of the Bureau of Public Works, in order to maintain order and tranquility in the court, still dispatched a large team of armed Chinese, Western, and Indian police, thirty to forty in number, led by Western Inspector Fan Pengnian, driving a large red police car with a machine gun installed on the front of the car. At 8 AM, they drove to the front of the First Special Court and stopped on the east side of North Zhejiang Road on Qipu Road, with the front of the car facing the court. Inspector Fan then ordered half of the armed police to be deployed on the left and right sides of the car, and the rest were sent to the court to assist the bailiffs in dispersing the posts. The first courtroom on the third floor, where the case was being heard, was also assigned additional bailiffs to patrol, and several senior Western police officers guarded the doors outside the courtroom. Anyone who was not involved in the case was not allowed to enter. The security was unprecedented. After 8 AM, Yun Huifang and her lawyer arrived at the court one after another. Only a very small number of representatives from various groups and members of the public were allowed to enter the courtroom. Those who arrived after 8:30 AM were all blocked outside the courtroom, giving them a sense of being so close yet so far away. Fortunately, they all knew to maintain order, so although three to five hundred people gathered in the narrow alley in front of the door and by the escalator for a time, there was no shouting or abrupt behavior. At 9:30 AM, Presiding Judge Feng Shide, Chief Prosecutor Wang Zuze, and Female Clerk Tang Weishu took their seats. Chinese Detective Zhao Bingkun, who was handling the case, brought the defendant Yun Huifang to the defendant's box. Yun had a smile on her face and was composed. First, Ru Baoyi, the prosecutor's lawyer for the police, stood up and stated that the police had filed an appeal with the Second High Court against the previous court's decision to grant bail to the defendant. The appeal case has not yet been resolved by the Second High Court, so the case cannot proceed today and should be postponed until the appeal issue is resolved. Defendant's lawyer Zhao Chen immediately expressed agreement to the postponement. Judge Feng then declared that the case file had been summoned by the High Court and had not yet been returned, so it must be postponed. As soon as the High Court decides to return the case file, the court will be opened. He then wrote a note stating that the case file had been summoned by the High Court and would be scheduled for trial after it was returned. Yun Huifang then left the defendant's box and left the court with representatives from various groups. The audience then dispersed, and all security measures were also withdrawn, returning to normal. It was only ten o'clock at this time. Lawyer Zhao Chen made a statement regarding the appeal against Yun's bail, stating (above omitted): "Article 67 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the power to detain the defendant during the trial belongs to the presiding judge or the assigned judge. Article 74 stipulates that the defendant may at any time apply for the termination of detention upon providing bail. Although Article 414 allows the parties to appeal to the direct superior court if they are dissatisfied with the court's ruling, the legislative intent of Article 415 is to ensure the defendant's status. The current spirit of the Criminal Procedure Law places great emphasis on the defendant's interests. The police's position, in terms of assisting the judiciary, is similar to the public security bureau in the mainland, and in terms of representing the prosecution, it is similar to the prosecutor of the court. We have never heard of a public security bureau transferring a suspect to the court and then appealing because the court granted bail, nor have we heard of a prosecutor filing a public prosecution and then disagreeing because the trial judge granted the defendant bail and appealing to the superior court. This strange phenomenon is not seen in the mainland, but it has become a bad example in the concession, which is not a way to protect the defendant's interests. In fact, according to the agreement of the Chinese courts in the Public Concession, the police only have a portion of the power of investigation and public prosecution. The prosecutor can still appear in court to state his opinion and cannot go beyond the scope of the agreement and the Criminal Procedure Law, and have all the powers that the prosecutor has or does not have. It is hoped that the police authorities will respect the interests of the defendant and accept well-intentioned advice to remedy the future. Otherwise, it may be suspected of interfering with the trial. Moreover, Yun has provided bail twice and has never escaped or failed to appear, and there is no risk of collusion or destruction of evidence, and the suspicion of her crime is not as serious as the police claimed. There is no question that bail should be granted. The police lawyer is honest and upright, why should he oppose it and why should he appeal, just to delay the progress of the case? As for the substantive issue of the Yun case, I have long determined it to be a continuous crime during the first hearing, but I did not want to express my opinion casually because the debate period had not arrived."</p>

<p>Returned to Beijing the Same Evening</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by night express train at about 8 AM yesterday. The reporter from the Central News Agency visited him at his residence. According to him, Chairman Lin, Premier Wang, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, and Minister Song, etc., discussed the issue of Premier Wang's resignation at Lushan a few days ago. Although Wang still expressed his firm resignation, all parties insisted on retaining him, so the issue will be discussed at the Central Standing Committee meeting today (i.e., yesterday) and then discussed at the Central Standing Committee meeting on Thursday before being submitted to the Third Plenary Session for resolution. Zhang Xueliang, knowing that he was mentally exhausted and dissatisfied by the public, resolutely retired, which is admirable. As for the military affairs in North China, the Beijing Branch of the Military Affairs Commission is responsible for handling them. I was in Beijing and had not heard of the Japanese army invading Rehe again until I saw it in the newspaper. It is also learned that Mr. Chu returned to Beijing last night.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Railways surveyed and determined the new site for the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Shanghai Passenger Transport Terminal and the Combined Transport Terminal, the Shanghai Municipal Government was requested to issue a public notice regarding the acquisition of land. The sale and transfer of land was suspended for three weeks from the first day of the month. Now, the Ministry of Railways believes that the surveying and purchase of the site has not yet been completed, and the suspension of the sale and transfer of land is about to expire. Minister Gu Mengyu has specially telegraphed the Municipal Government to issue another public notice to extend the suspension of the sale and transfer of land in the area for another three weeks from August 22.</p>

<p>Crime Cannot Be Pursued</p>
<p>The Pole, Du Boliewa Sigen (transliteration), is employed at a leather and soap factory established by a Westerner in Caojiadu. At about 9 AM on the 20th of this month, a neighbor, Strong Wu, a native of Suzhou, went out to wash clothes and passed by the entrance of the leather and soap factory. Unexpectedly, she was forcibly dragged in by the Pole under the eyes of nearby residents, causing a great uproar. The incident was reported to the nearby police, who entered the factory to investigate and saw the Pole, Du Boliewa Sigen, hugging Strong Wu on his lap, and Strong Wu shouting for help, claiming rape. The police obtained the Pole, who indeed intended to rape the Chinese woman, and took the Pole, Du Boliewa Sigen, and Strong Wu to the Sixth District Headquarters for investigation. After questioning, Director Zhang learned that the Pole did intend to rape the woman. Because he was a citizen of a country without a treaty, he was sentenced to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>The Dajilun tugboat, which towed a barge loaded with iron to Wuxi the day before yesterday, unexpectedly sailed to the Yejidun area in western Shanghai. The tugboat wanted to turn, but the helmsman lacked experience, causing the ship to list. The small barge being towed bore the brunt of the accident, causing all six people on the barge, including the family of Yue Haiqing, to fall into the water, and the boat capsized. Rescue efforts were made, but Yue's 11-year-old niece, Yue Xiujin, drowned. The body was not recovered until the afternoon and was taken to the Local Court yesterday for examination. Prosecutor Xie and others examined the body according to the law and confirmed that the body was indeed drowned. It was ordered that the body be taken for burial and await investigation.</p>

<p>The Du family from Funing Arrested Yesterday, around 6 PM, the Second Squad of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau's Water Patrol Team, based on informant reports, learned that two bandit ships were anchored near Xiaogang, Tanzigang. Police Chief Zhang Yushu and others took a patrol boat to the specified location and found two ships anchored there. They boarded the ships and conducted a search, but found no contraband. Consequently, eleven people of all ages, including Du Wuhua, Du Qingfu, Du Hua, Du Xiaokouzi, Du Xiaoguniang, Liu Jiayuan, Liu Jiaxiang, Liu Zhang, Liu Zhu, Xiao Erzi, and Xiao Sanzi, all from Funing, were taken to the branch station and then transferred to the South City Headquarters. Under strict questioning by Squad Leader Zhu, Du Chunhua confessed that he was thirty-three years old. Du Qingfu was his father and brother. Hua was his wife, and Xiaokouzi and Xiaoguniang were his children. Two days ago, a carpenter he knew named Zhou Er asked him to transport three Browning pistols, fifteen rounds of ammunition, one Mauser pistol, and forty-eight rounds of ammunition to Funing, promising to pay him fifty-three dollars after the job was done. He, in a moment of folly, agreed. However, due to the inconvenient timing, he temporarily hid the firearms in a dilapidated coffin in a remote area of Dachang, intending to transport them to Funing when the opportunity arose. When questioned, Liu Jiayuan stated that he was thirty-three years old, Zhu was his mother, Zhang was his wife, and Jiaxiang, Xiao Erzi, and Xiao Sanzi were all his sons. He was a law-abiding citizen and had never been a robber, though he sometimes stole chickens in various cities. Du Chunhua was his cousin, but he had no knowledge of Du's private transportation of military supplies. Unexpectedly, after the case was exposed, his entire family was implicated, and he pleaded for leniency. The squad was ordered to escort Du to Dachang, where he pointed out the dilapidated coffin containing the hidden firearms. After the squad returned with the weapons, they prepared a report and transferred the case to the Municipal Public Safety Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhu Heshang, also known as Zhu Liangwu, a local resident, ran the Longchang Auto Repair Shop on Chengdu Road. Recently, he was suspected of armed robbery and kidnapping for ransom. He was arrested in front of the New World Hotel the other day by Kang Zengxiang, a Chinese detective from the General Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to the police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, the defendant was an accomplice of Dai Anxiang and Wang Jinsheng, who had already been sentenced to imprisonment by the court. At the time, the police had been searching for him without success. As the police have not yet fully investigated, they are not prosecuting him at this time but are requesting permission to detain him temporarily. Zhu hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him and requested bail. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the report and ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing. Zhu Heshang was temporarily detained.</p>

<p>Death Unforeseen</p>
<p>Han Jinsheng, twenty-six years old, a local resident and owner of Yongxing Redwood Workshop at No. 58 Lingji Street, Dadongmen, Nanshi, has recently been affected by the war, causing sluggish business in the shop, resulting in debts of over a thousand dollars. With increasing financial difficulties and the early loss of his parents, he felt helpless and decided to end his life. Around 4 PM on the thirteenth of this month, he left the shop and disappeared without a trace. The other day, the Wusongkou Lifesaving Bureau patrol boat recovered a floating corpse from the Huangpu River. As no relatives could be found, the body was temporarily kept by the undertaker. Later, Han's older brother, Dou Dezhuan, and others learned of it and went to Songjiang to identify the body, which turned out to be Han Jinsheng. Yesterday, several of his colleagues and friends re-coffined the body and transported it to Shanghai for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Publication of "Global Inspection Tour" <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the Tianjin Dagongbao newspaper sent reporter Cao Jun Gubing to travel to Soviet Russia. Upon his return, he wrote a book titled "Inspection Tour of Soviet Russia." Because it coincided with a time when the Chinese people felt bored and wanted to study the current situation in Soviet Russia, the book quickly became popular, selling tens of thousands of copies. However, Cao Jun's account only covered one aspect of the construction of the socialist country. As for the capitalist and imperialist countries, they are currently facing economic panic, and the state of that panic is lacking a specialized book introducing it. The book "Global Inspection Tour" is the latest record of Mr. Ji Hongchang, Meng Xianzhang, Ling Mianzhi, Yu Furun, and others traveling around Asia, America, Europe, and Africa for six months from last autumn to this spring, covering about twenty countries. It describes in detail the political, military, economic, and social conditions of various countries, especially the various social problems caused by economic panic, as well as various new inventions, great engineering projects, and the current situation of millions of Chinese merchants and overseas Chinese scattered around the world. In addition to the main text of about 200,000 words, it also includes forty-six color pictures, such as the 102-story skyscraper in New York, the British naval review of hundreds of warships, and the German Zeppelin airship, which can broaden people's horizons. This book is published by the Oriental Society at No. 10 Xinping Road, Beiping. To make it accessible to the public, it is only priced at one yuan. It has been delivered to the Ri Xin Bookstore and the Shenzhou Beixin Modern Bookstore at No. 19 Baolongfang, Albert Road, for distribution. Mr. Ji and others spent about 60,000 yuan on this trip, and this book is the result. Readers only need to spend one yuan to read this book, and its effect is equivalent to spending 60,000 yuan to travel around the world.</p>

<p>The leather belts of cotton spinning mills often need to be cleaned with oxalic acid. Last year, most of the oxalic acid on the market was of inferior quality. The factories switched to buying a ready-made solution to replace it, which cost ten times more each month. Recently, the Yong'an Third Factory entrusted the Commodity Inspection Bureau to test the solution. The result was that it contained only 3% oxalic acid. Therefore, the Yong'an Third Factory purchased oxalic acid from British merchants and prepared it according to the method, saving dozens of yuan each month.</p>

<p>The Central Grand Theater on Yunnan Road has been renowned for years in Shanghai for screening the first-run films of the Star Film Company. Since the beginning of summer this year, due to the hot weather and the impact of the war, Star's new films have not been shown at the theater for a long time. "Love and Death," recently premiered at the Lutian Cinema in Paris, is the latest production of Star Film Company, directed by Cheng Bugao, director of "Luoxia Gulu," starring Zheng Xiaoqiu and Zhu Qiuhen. Zhu is a rising star whose performance is very impressive. Old Jinghua was her initial screen test, but her subtle and vivid portrayal has already surpassed her predecessors. In this film, although she does not speak, her expressions are touching and penetrating. In addition, the scenery and photography in the film are beautifully enhanced, so Miss Zhu's artistry in this film, like flowers and leaves complementing each other, is even more radiant.

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of Mr. Wang Xiaoshan, who claims that the news item in the Shen Bao on the 19th of this month regarding the accidental fire at the Jichangli rattan workshop in Wangjia Wharf contains many inaccuracies. According to Mr. Xiaoshan, he has been running the Yixinglong rattan workshop for more than ten years. Recently, due to busy summer business, he has been stocking more goods than usual and has fire insurance of 1,500 taels to guard against unforeseen circumstances. On the 18th, during the Ghost Festival, offerings were made on the overpass building, and when burning paper ingots, the fire somehow spread to the rattan material and caused it to ignite. He immediately directed his partners to put out the fire. The easterly wind was very strong on that day, and despite their best efforts to extinguish the flames, they were unable to do so, causing it to spread to neighboring houses, resulting in unfortunate damage. Mr. Xiaoshan is honest and sincere, as known by his neighbors, who are willing to vouch for him. The report that his business was sluggish and that he had a large amount of fire insurance in order to engage in illegal activities is untrue and may cause confusion and damage to his reputation. Therefore, he has specially entrusted our law firm to send this letter for factual correction. Accordingly, we are sending this letter, hoping that your newspaper will publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column for correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhou Shiying</p>

<h3 id="e177">Locking up Nian Gengyao and Random Notes on the Western Campaign <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The literary inquisitions of the early Qing Dynasty were very cruel, especially the case of Wang Jingqi, a recommended scholar from Qiantang, and his "Random Notes on the Western Campaign." Not only was Wang's family exterminated, but the Yongzheng Emperor was angered at other recommended scholars in Zhejiang. Therefore, in the fifth year of Yongzheng, an imperial edict was issued: "The scholars of Zhejiang have immoral habits, and the recommended scholars are suspended from the provincial examination." It was not until the eighth year of Yongzheng, Gengxu, that the recommended scholars of Zhejiang were allowed to participate in the provincial examination. This literary inquisition can be considered to have been handled on a very large scale.</p>
<p>Referring to the joint memorial of Fu Min, the Governor of Zhejiang, and E Mida, the General of Zhejiang, on October 17th of the third year of Yongzheng, we can see that the discovery of the "Random Notes on the Western Campaign" and the locking up of Nian Gengyao were related. The memorial stated:</p>
<p>"::: On September 28th, at Shenshi (3-5 PM), the Imperial Envoy and Minister of Leisure Duties, Dutong (Military Governor) Laxi, arrived in Hangzhou, bearing the imperial edict to lock up Nian Gengyao. Accordingly, that night, Dutong Laxi and I summoned Nian Gengyao to my office. I read the imperial edict aloud and immediately locked him up and placed him under guard. :::</p>
<p>::: Furthermore, we jointly searched Nian Gengyao's inner chambers and the letters in his study and kitchen cabinets, but found not a single piece of paper. We then interrogated his family members, who testified that Nian Gengyao had burned all his letters on September 12th. When we questioned Nian Gengyao, his confession was no different. After Laxi left, we conducted another detailed search of his heavy belongings and found two books of handwritten notes among the waste paper, titled "Reading Hall Random Notes on the Western Campaign." There was a preface by Wang Jingqi. Upon close examination, we found that what was said inside was rebellious. After secretly investigating the person for several days, we learned on October 16th that Wang Jingqi was Wang Riqi, a recommended scholar from Qiantang County. :::</p>
<p>At that time, Yongzheng was furious and wrote a rescript in red ink: "Two books of seditious words, temporarily retained." Although it was said to be "temporarily retained," this "Random Notes on the Western Campaign" was retained until after the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, when books from the imperial palace were scattered among the people, and the "Random Notes on the Western Campaign" became a book of tales. If Nian Gengyao had burned it at that time, Wang Jingqi's tragedy would have been avoided, and this "Random Notes on the Western Campaign" would have turned to ashes and could not have spread among the people.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Germany's Landscape Policy <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Shizi</p>
<p>The cleanliness of German streets has always been praised by the world.</p>
<p>Even the English, who pride themselves on being gentlemen, are ashamed of it. However, the cleanliness of German streets is not only true in cities but also in mountains and plains, especially in the management of scenery. Each state government has enacted special laws. All buildings of historical or scenic significance in the mountains and plains, whether publicly or privately owned, are not allowed to be damaged or demolished.</p>
<p>People who want to build a few houses by the mountains and rivers for their families to stay in during their free time, even if the land is privately owned, must first report to the Mountain Management Office. The experts of the office will carefully study it. If the plan does not harm the natural scenery, construction will be allowed. Otherwise, even if the house has been completed, it will be ordered to be demolished.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that Switzerland has beautiful mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>It was originally known as the park of Europe. However, since the Great War, all international conferences have been held there. Global dignitaries have come and gone, and those who like quiet have left. In addition, the cost of living has increased more than ever before. As a result, tourists have flocked north. The Germans, seeing an opportunity, have worked hard to attract tourists and promote the sale of goods and the prosperity of cities. Anything that can entertain tourists is vigorously pursued. Even advertising is strictly managed. Advertising signs are not allowed to be set up in places frequented by tourists, because they would obstruct the tourists' view and prevent them from fully appreciating the scenery of the lakes and mountains. A friend of mine once traveled to Germany and told me that he had traveled by train for one hour and twenty minutes and had seen only eleven advertising signs along the way. None of them were larger than ten square feet. Moreover, it is not known how much tax had to be paid for the permission of the managers to set up such advertising signs. The strictness of the management can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Recently, the Germans have been working harder to educate the children of the whole country about landscape policy. It is expected that in a few years, Germany's landscape policy will make even more amazing progress. Not only will it take over Switzerland's position, but I am afraid that all European tourists will be absorbed. Looking back at the countryside of our country, the roads are full of manure, which is disgusting. Even the Six Bridges and the Three Temples are full of villas on the lake and beggars on the mountains. How can we attract tourists? I know that the mountain spirits, if they knew, would also cry sadly.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Baishe Speaks <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Baishe</p>
<p>! Is it struggle or is it a charge?</p>
<p>! One of the great habits of the Chinese people!</p>
<p>Perhaps the Chinese cultivate a kind of ability to struggle in ordinary times? To put it more realistically, maybe they are practicing the skills of charging and fighting at any time and any place? Otherwise, why do they always try to be the first to get on the train, on the streetcar, and on the ship? You grab, and I grab, and in the end, it becomes a mess. In the end, no one can get on first?</p>
<p>I nagged my friends for more than half an hour about getting ahead, and what was the result? Just like a certain meeting, everyone patted their butts and left.</p>
<p>Now I will ask: "In the last earthquake in Japan, did more Chinese or Japanese die?" Maybe everyone will say in unison: "Of course more Japanese died, because the number of Chinese in Japan is far less than the number of local Japanese." However, according to the results of the most reliable investigations, there are opposite numbers. Where does this come from? The Japanese line up when they get on the ship, like ropes on a winch, smooth and unobstructed. What about the Chinese? They are huddled together like a stone cake. After a while, the stone cake turns into a pile of mountains. Is it possible to swallow the whole mountain in one bite? However, the more you can't swallow it, the bigger the area of the pile of mountains becomes. The organizational aspect also tends to be more and more tight in proportion, and finally becomes extremely solid. Naturally, it is impossible to swallow it in one bite, but the more you can't swallow it, the more I want you to swallow it. This shows the greatness of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>There are so many facts as right as this that they can be loaded in train cars,</p>
<p>But saying more may not help the real situation. What's more, now is a time of national crisis. This kind of struggle and charging training is also indispensable for the Chinese people, so I'm too lazy to drag it out.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Love of Birds <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>"Their bodies lack the colored phoenix's nimble wings, but their hearts have the telepathic understanding."</p>
<p>From these two lines of poetry, we can see that the ancients had a considerable understanding of the love of birds. "The bridal tree still blends its branches, and the mandarin ducks do not sleep alone." This uses mandarin ducks as the representative of love.</p>
<p>In fact, love in birds is not limited to mandarin ducks. Love in birds is not just about flying together and sleeping together. Now I will give a few examples of facts that exist in slope situations.</p>
<p>(1) Kissing: Pigeons of both sexes kiss each other, which can often be seen. There is a kind of bird called the lovebird, the male and female never leave each other, and their beaks are always connected together.</p>
<p>(2) Singing: We buy a phonograph record in a shop and listen to him sing a few sentences of "I love you," "I love you," or "Love You Love You," a kind of crude singing. Compared with birds, it is really worlds apart. The beautiful sounds of birds, such as the lark, the oriole, and the thrush, are all admired by those who have heard them. Their songs are all for love.</p>
<p>(3) Modernization: Men and women strolling in the field of love all seek to be "modernized" in their clothes and costumes. This probably helps a lot in love. As for birds, since they don't have a penny to their name, where does modernization come from? The answer is: No. Birds are born modern. The peacock's brocade screen, the kingfisher's bright green, and the parrot's beautiful feathers are their heavenly</p>
<p>adornments.</p>
<p>(4) Dancing: A species of bird from Australia arranges a clean dance floor on the flat ground under the shade of trees. Or they specially build dance rooms decorated with branches, leaves, and bird feathers. However, birds only have two pairs of legs, unlike humans who also have two hands. Therefore, birds don't know any "Charleston" or waltzes." Their dancing is just opening their wings and fluttering back and forth, their feathers rubbing against each other.</p>
<h3 id="e181">A Spectator Who Slept for a Long Time <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Mianmian</p>
<p>Once, when the French theater in Paris was performing a work by the famous writer Orcia, the author of "La Dame aux Camélias," Alexander Dumas fils, who was sitting next to Orcia, saw a spectator sleeping in front of the stage. He pointed to this spectator and said to Orcia:</p>
<p>"Look! What is the effect of your work?"</p>
<p>Orcia was furious. Later, on the day when Dumas's work was being performed on the same stage, he was determined to find a sleeping spectator. Sure enough, he found a sleeping spectator in a seat close to the stage. He proudly pointed to this spectator and said to Dumas:</p>
<p>"Do you understand? This is the effect of your work." Dumas looked at this spectator and replied:</p>
<p>"Ah! I remember this person's face. He was the spectator that night. He hasn't woken up yet!"</p>
<h3 id="e182">A Secret History of the Twenty-One Demands (1) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>This secret history concerning the Twenty-One Demands that Japan presented to our nation in 1915 was dictated by the late Bishop Brent the year before his passing. However, it had never been published until recently. This article extensively clarifies the duplicity and fickleness of Japanese diplomacy and the world's concern for the Chinese issue. A verbatim translation of the original follows.</p>
<p>I have been overseeing Chinese missionary work since 1907. In the autumn of 1914, I traveled to Tokyo for church affairs. Bishop Harris asked if I would like to meet with then-Prime Minister of Japan, Marquis Ōkuma. I asked, "Was this meeting suggested by Marquis Ōkuma?" He laughed and said, "Yes." I replied that I would be very willing to speak with him and so a meeting was arranged for the following day.</p>
<p>The purpose of Marquis Ōkuma's meeting with me was to ask me to carry a message to China, urging China not to declare war or create disturbances due to the Japanese military's invasion of China. At that time, the Japanese army was preparing to attack Qingdao from the rear. This action by Japan was a violation of Chinese sovereignty, just as Germany violated Belgian sovereignty. During the meeting, Marquis Ōkuma said, "During my term as Prime Minister, I will never wage war against China." Later, he repeatedly declared, "As long as I am in office, Japan will never commit the great injustice of invading China."</p>
<p>After returning to China, I did not immediately convey Marquis Ōkuma's message to the Chinese government. During this time, I pondered how to offer China the best advice. At that moment, the Japanese Minister to China, Hioki Eki, came to see me, saying that he had just received a telegram from Marquis Ōkuma instructing him to visit me and ask me to restate the main points of Ōkuma's conversation with me.</p>
<p>I believed that Hioki Eki belonged to the pro-war faction, while Marquis Ōkuma belonged to the peace faction. Therefore, I clearly explained Ōkuma's promise to me. Hioki Eki asked me what kind of just attitude Japan should adopt towards China, Russia, and the United States. That afternoon, he spent half the day raising various questions on this topic and then listening to my opinions. I pointed out to him that Japan's proper policy should be to exert efforts to maintain peace with all countries, establishing itself as a leader in industry and commerce in the Far East and even the Pacific, just as Britain is a leader in industry and commerce in the Atlantic, and should not rely on military force to plot political hegemony.</p>
<p>I was eager to go to western China, so I packed my bags within three or four days. Before leaving, I went to the Japanese embassy to say goodbye to Hioki Eki and said to him that because I was in a hurry to leave now, I would return to visit him in the spring after returning from Sichuan.</p>
<p>After Hioki Eki visited, I went to see Tsai Ting-kan, telling him that I was there to convey a message from Japan, but that I could not be responsible for whether the message was truthful. I was merely like a postman. I then told him about my conversation with Marquis Ōkuma and my subsequent meeting with Hioki Eki. I thought Tsai Ting-kan must have conveyed this message to Yuan Shikai. Later, he came to talk to me a second time. Tsai Ting-kan told me that Yuan Shikai wanted to ask me whether Marquis Ōkuma could keep his word. I told him that I thought Marquis Ōkuma was sincere when he made this promise, and that he would be willing to abide by his promise as much as possible. However, in my opinion, he might be forced to make harsh demands on China, or he might have to resign,</p>
<p>allowing the military faction to take charge of the Japanese government.</p>

<h3 id="e183">I Ask, What to Do? <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our side has strongly advocated recovering the lost territories of the Northeast, but to date, we have not seen a single soldier or general sent to recover the Northeast. However, the Japanese militarists' second and third steps of invasion are being revealed one after another. According to yesterday's news reports, the Japanese army suddenly launched a two-pronged attack on Rehe, one from Yizhou and the other from Chaoyang Temple, using armored vehicles as the vanguard and fiercely attacking Nanling Pass. They also dispatched seven planes to drop bombs, destroying all the buildings. I ask, what should the military and political authorities do?</p>
<p>Although Dong’s Rehe army is resisting desperately, the lower-ranking officers are furious and enraged, and they telegraph Tang Yulin, urging him to issue a resistance order quickly. However, Tang has made no response. How can Dong's army alone resist for long? They will inevitably be sacrificed under Japanese bombs and artillery fire, and the map of Rehe will change color. I ask, what to do? It is also reported that the Japanese plan to occupy Rehe and then sign a treaty with Puyi to cede the three provinces to Japan, while at the same time coveting Beijing and Tianjin, supporting the restoration of the Qing dynasty under Xuantong. Geographically speaking, if Rehe is lost, Beijing and Tianjin will not be easy to defend. Then, the Manchu restorationists will once again enter the pass with great fanfare and stage their signature act of the "Emperor Dream." I ask, what to do? Since they have dreamed of becoming emperors and establishing their small court in the Northeast, they will certainly not be satisfied with that. They will inevitably, under the banner of the Japanese, be ambitious and press forward step by step. The Japanese, of course, will use these brainless puppets to open up new territories one after another. I ask, what to do?</p>
<p>Seeing that the authorities have no solution and the military is irresponsible, the people either "flee north to the barbarians or flee south to Guangdong." They either call themselves slaves, present court tablets, and willingly become third- or fourth-class slaves, or they run under the banner of red and do the work of mercilessly killing people. I ask, what to do?</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Light Bulb <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yong</p>
<p>With the advancement of science, how fortunate people are to have gained control over nature. Since the invention of the light bulb, haven't we conquered the terrifying darkness? Now, the application of light bulbs is very common. In places like Shanghai, almost every household uses them. At night, the main roads are illuminated as bright as day. But we must know how much blood and sweat the inventor spent and how much time it took. Therefore, we cannot help but study it.</p>
<p>Before understanding its structure, we should first know its principle. Originally, when an electric current passes through a metal with high resistance, it generates heat, and when the heat reaches a very high temperature, it emits light.</p>
<p>Therefore, a light bulb is a glass sphere with a very thin metal filament inside. When an electric current passes through it, this metal filament emits light. According to the above principle, this metal filament must have three conditions:</p>
<p>First, it must have great resistance, so metals with resistance such as platinum must be used, and it must be very thin.</p>
<p>Second, it must be a metal that will not melt when exposed to high temperatures. Third, it must be a metal that will not vaporize.</p>
<p>Because this light-emitting filament caused many difficulties, it could only be resolved by various methods, so gradually there came about the perfect result we have today. It can be divided into four periods, and now I will briefly explain them separately, so that you can understand its structure.</p>
<p>(1) Platinum Period: During this period, a glass bulb was not used. Instead, two copper pillars were used, with a very thin platinum wire (the filament) connecting the two ends. Then, the electric current was passed through, and the platinum wire emitted light, becoming the earliest electric lamp. But this was very dangerous, because without a cover, it was easy to catch fire. So the second step was to cover the light-emitting platinum wire with a glass cover, using very thick platinum strips to connect the filament, with the two ends exposed outside the cover, in order to conduct electricity. If we still used this kind of light bulb today, made of expensive platinum, it would not only be impossible to make it widespread, but even the very wealthy would probably not dare to use it. So, soon it progressed to the second period.</p>
<p>(2) Carbon Filament Period: Using carbon filament instead of platinum certainly made it much cheaper, but there were two prerequisite difficulties: first, how to make the carbon into thin filaments; second, how to prevent the carbon filaments from vaporizing. It took a lot of time and research to find the answers. The solution to the first problem was to split bamboo into thin filaments, and after a long time of sunning and baking, when it became very dry, to immerse it in concentrated sulfuric acid, and it would become carbon filaments. What about solving the second problem? The air inside the glass bulb had to be completely extracted, so that it became a vacuum, and then it would not vaporize. At this time, it was finally successful, but after a short period of testing, it was still not satisfactory. Originally, the carbon filament was too brittle and could not be bent, so the inventor continued his research, and soon he reached the third period.</p>
<p>(3) Tungsten Period: At this time, tungsten wire was used to make the filament. Originally, the nature of tungsten was powder and could not be condensed. During the European War, a great German scientist invented a method of condensation. American scientist Edison, who was researching light bulbs, cooperated with him and made the tungsten into a filament. At this time, the two ends of the conductor exposed outside the bulb were still platinum. Now a cheaper metal (Invae) is also used. Therefore, the light bulb has become perfect and its value is very low and its utility is very common. The inventors who created happiness for the world are still not satisfied, because tungsten wire is easy to evaporate, and there is often a layer of black mist on the bulb, and it cannot be used for a long time, so they continue to work hard and reach the fourth period.</p>
<p>(4) Nitrogen Period: At this time, the glass bulb is filled with nitrogen, which on the one hand prevents the evaporation of tungsten wire, and on the other hand saves the difficult procedure of extracting a vacuum. Since then, we have the cheap, durable and beautiful light bulb that we use today.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see how much effort the scientists put in to create a small light bulb. And there are so many treasures in the world waiting for people to discover and create all kinds of things for people to use. We really want to learn from Edison to discover treasures and create happiness for mankind!</p>

<h3 id="e189">My Views on Improving General Social Psychology <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Shizhi</p>
<p>Perhaps everyone thinks this way: the current society, especially Chinese society, is bad, deformed, semi-feudal, and unhealthy. It is still in a transitional period where the old society has not completely collapsed and the new society has not been completely built. Only people in this transitional era are often the most painful and depressed, as if wandering at a crossroads, not knowing where to go. Therefore, they feel dissatisfied with this reality, express disapproval, and feel that the distance to the ideal society cannot be measured.</p>
<p>Therefore, the "Society Improvement Discussion Group" in this column was born in response to the needs of the times. However, most of the previous discussions focused on material aspects or the improvement of the external environment, and there was little discussion on the improvement of the general psychology of each individual. It must be known that society itself will not be riddled with diseases and become unmanageable. Therefore, what makes it riddled with diseases and unmanageable is still gradually created by each individual who makes up this society. And the reason why each individual creates this kind of bad society is still because there is a deeply rooted and unbreakable remnant (that is, psychology) in their minds that is enough to hinder social progress and prevent the birth of a new society, lurking and active, causing the skeleton of the old society to raise its head again, the remnants of the old society to continue to grow, the construction of the new society to have no way to start, and the spirit of the new society to have no way to realize.</p>
<p>The worst of these psychologies include the following:</p>
<p>(1) Selfishness</p>
<p>(2) Hypocrisy and deception</p>
<p>(3) Emphasis on appearance</p>
<p>(4) Suspicion and conspiracy</p>
<p>With a selfish psychology, one cannot be selfless, honest, and law-abiding. With a hypocritical and deceptive psychology, one cannot be calm, responsible, and honest. With a psychology that emphasizes appearance, one cannot be down-to-earth and realistic. With a psychology of suspicion and conspiracy, one cannot trust each other and unite. If we want the society and the country to embark on a bright and smooth road, we must thoroughly eradicate these four kinds of poisons left over from the old society, and we must thoroughly improve these four kinds of bad psychologies left over from the old society.</p>

<p>— I</p>
<p>When her husband left her sickbed, her bean-sized tears fell like raindrops, her face turned from pale to gray, and she buried her head in the quilt, her thin shoulders twitching constantly. This moved all the patients in the third-class ward and surprised them greatly: "Why is she so sad?" "Miss Li?!" Huang Qiuying, who was sleeping next to her, asked earnestly, "Why are you so sad? Didn't the doctor say that your illness requires special rest?"</p>
<p>She was still crying, and crying even more pitifully. After a long time, she turned her face and sobbed to Huang Qiuying; "I can't escape this sea of suffering, my illness can't be cured, I hope I can die sooner, at this time I feel that death has great significance for me."</p>
<p>At this time, she had no tears and no more crying, only this desperate, low voice. However, the compassionate Huang Qiuying still comforted her softly;</p>
<p>"But you can't think like that, illnesses can always be cured, as long as you can rest well. In fact, everyone will die, but no one wants to die, because death is ultimately very scary."</p>
<p>"But, I feel that death is very happy for me." After that, she spoke even more eloquently; "You know, the doctor has proved that my tuberculosis is more serious than before. Four months ago, I stayed here for a while. When the doctor allowed me to go out to recuperate, my friends said that I was much healthier than when I entered the hospital. Of course, I needed better rest. But we young people are always easily excited, and I simply cannot get used to a quiet life. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, I have firmly joined the nursing team because everyone should bear the responsibility of anti-imperialism. Needless to say, I was very busy at that time, and I even had very little sleep. As a result, my temperature increased, from 37 degrees to 39 or 40 degrees. Of course, my illness relapsed, and sometimes I even coughed up blood. :: Friend! Do you think that a person who can't work like this is simply a waste? From that time on, I felt that my existence was really too meaningless."</p>
<p>"Don't say it anymore, rest for a while now, you're talking too much." Huang Qiuying was very worried about her and now dissuaded her. However, she did not stop talking because of her dissuasion, she continued to speak, and her tone was so desolate and plaintive.</p>
<p>"My friend, although we only have two or three months of friendship, I believe in you very much, I feel that you are my true sympathizer, so I boldly want to ask you for help. There is still a child in my family who is less than two years old, and I love him very much. After I die, I hope you can often go to see him, and care for him as you care for your own children. If there is really a soul after death, then my soul will be comforted by your love! Friend, this is my last request."</p>
<p>"But why do you have to say that? Didn't you say that your husband loves you and your child very much?"</p>
<p>"No, my good friend, you know that my husband just came to say goodbye to me. He has joined the XX Suicide Squad, and he will leave tonight, I think we will not have a chance to meet again, because he is going to fight in close quarters, fighting for the survival of the nation, and I am in such a critical condition. But, my husband! I hope to see him one last time before I die! I want to have such a good opportunity."</p>
<p>She was crying again.</p>
<p>Finally, she said decisively;</p>
<p>"But, friend! You must not tell him my unfortunate news when he is killing the enemy, because he loves me too much, and he may abandon his great responsibility because of this!"</p>
<p>After that, she stopped talking, looking straight ahead, completely immersed in deep fantasy.</p>
<p>Pessimism</p>

<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>"Cry, I cried, the nameless sorrow that had been abandoned for a long time gently struck my heart again; the first wave of dark shadows that were difficult to eliminate was as uncomfortable as suffocating, the inexplicable grief, I cried for a long time, and now my heart seems to be much relieved::</p>
<p>A melancholy young man, which could be seen from his thin cheeks and dull eyes, he bit the other end of the pen, watching a small tree swaying in the wind and rain outside the window,</p>
<p>"Poor little tree, you symbolize my destiny," his mouth moved slightly, and a tear that had been held back in his eye socket finally rolled down,</p>
<p>"Since" he shook his head, as if trying to dispel all the pain, and continued to write his diary, "my younger siblings were unreasonably made to suffer by his mother, although they were born of a different mother, I love them as much as life, because I am already a completely soulless walking corpse, they - my father's flesh and blood - I must make them continue my father's legacy, in their weak hearts, how can I keep this kind of bad image, so I resolutely embarked on my drifting journey, the ends of the earth, stay anywhere, maintain the happiness of my whole family, over the years, my father's spirit in heaven followed me like this, I struggled, I struggled, and when I felt a little discouraged, my father appeared in front of me again, and the life of drifting also had a special flavor and was full of interest, this time the war gave me a major blow, the lives and property of the Chinese people, the government completely has no ability to protect, a small family that I have been struggling to manage for several years has been buried in the fire, although this little thing is not worth anyone's attention, it is a great loss to me in my whole life, I escaped from the fire, am I not ridiculed for being greedy for life and afraid of death? But what is the use of the posthumous glory of dying on the battlefield? I can eat, fight, struggle::</p>
<p>Suddenly a desolate and desperate singing voice came from the two alleys, he knew it was an old man and his granddaughter, swaying in the autumn wind and rain, this intermittent singing voice made people unbearable to listen to, he pushed away the diary, jumped onto the bed, buried his head in the pillow, and cried out loud again the poor little tree was broken in the waist by the autumn wind and rain, and leaned obliquely in the mud and water by the roadside.</p>
