<p>時評</p>
<h3>農村衰落中食糧入口之槪觀乃</h3>
<p>目下農村衰落其原因自甚複雜如絲茶出口失敗而農村對於工業品之消費伋然未減以致金錢流向都市農村金融窘迫農產物遂不能急於求售價格緣以暴跌又如商人財力之消失足以使農產物需要減少而秋收豐稔復使供給增多此要皆爲目下農產低跌農村恐慌之原因然其最主要之原因則爲外國農產在華之傾售</p>
<p>就食糧一項而言其主要之米小麥麵粉三項民十八以來三年間之進口數如次（單位擔）</p>
<p>民　　　十　　八　　民　　十　　九　　　民　　二　　十</p>
<p>米　　一○八二二八○五　　一九八九一一○三　　一○七四○八一○　　小麥　　五六六三八四六　　　二七六二二四○　　二二七七三四二四　　麵粉　一一九三五二九六　　　五一八八一七四　　　四八八九二七五</p>
<p>就上列數字以觀察厅知食糧之進口實以去歲爲最多去歲食糧進口之獨多一則因民十九春夏之交承民十八荒歉之餘糧價高昂食糧商多獲巨利一般人以爲囤糧可以致富定購期貨遂致過多二則因去秋長江空前大水一般人以爲災後食糧缺乏必可居奇遂不惜大批定購而按之實際則民十九長江流域及東南各省米收甚豐北方小麥收成亦極美滿去年雖大水爲災但傷害禾稼甚屬有限民十九川省苦旱米收僅及四成而去年則已復常態湖北因稻田多在高處收穫轉極豐盈湖南被災區域僅爲該省東北部分未被水區域產米尙富足以供給全省而豫南各縣產米亦極豐饒故認災後食糧缺乏實爲皮相之談</p>
<p>去年進口小麥達二千二百七十萬擔之鉅實爲空前紀錄以民十八西北食麥之區空前大旱而民十八十九兩年間小麥及麫粉之進口乃反遠遜於去年其爲錯亂失常自無疑義此二千二百七十萬擔小麥之中政府借麥項下僅一百五十萬擔故商人自動輸入者實達二千一百二十萬擔此蓋因國内統計缺乏物產盈虚漫無稽考水災以後朝野粉然僉以民食爲慮政府旣已借麥於前人民更盲從購麥於後復以洋麥入口大抵利用交易所爲工具粉廠購麥亦往往同時在交易所抛出期粉一般投機者昧於世界大勢不明世界恐慌之成因及其所至之階段一見粉麥跌價爭購恐後致其給果一巳遭罹損失社會同受其累</p>
<p>迨及今歲食糧之入口仍方興未艾據關册所載其數量如次（單位擔）</p>
<p>米　　　　　穀　　小　　　　　麥　　麵　　　　粉</p>
<p>一月　　一七三三一一三　　一三三八○九九　　六○五○八八　　二月　　一三九六四五八　　　九○一四七九　　九一九六三九　　三月　　二四四八二五五　　二一七五七一五　一○○九八一二　　四月　　二八七三三八○　　二七二八五九九　　八六七三九一　　五月　　二九九四○六九　　一七六五○五二　　九一二一二五　　六月　　二○○八六五三　　一六五四七七九　　四二七六八一　　七月　　一九○三二一四　　　八四一三五八　　二五六一八四　　八月　　一六七五六○二　　　二四九九九六　　二九二八五一　　九月　　一二六五○三六　　　一九八○二六　　二八○二八九　　　　　一八二九七七八○　一一八五三一○三　五五七一○六○</p>
<p>由上述數字以觀察則九閱月間米穀入口之數量已遠過去年全年總數</p>
<p>足見去秋大水以後商人購辦洋米之踴躍而過去各省之禁米出境以及目下之米捐要皆足使洋米暢銷而國内產米反致停積淤滯而終於受損也此外小麥入口雖僅及去年全數之半而較之以前各年已遠過之麵粉則已超過去年全年進口額而小麥麫粉之中政府借麥項下本年運到者則爲小麥麫粉各二百十萬擔在總數中所占成分甚小可知外糧在華之傾銷其影響於目下農村經濟者實較政府借麥爲尤甚也</p>
<p>吾人於此有可恍然者則目下農村之衰落實即世界恐慌波濤之侵入此宰制世界之列强一面旣相率築造高不可攀之關稅壁壘其必須以殖民地及準殖民地爲其過剩產物之尾閭乃理有固然勢所必至而經濟落後組織散漫之中國旣失其經濟上防守之長城國家之經濟政策與人民之商業知識又皆幼稚若此欲其不爲隣國之壑者豈爲事勢之所許吾人將欲建造一關稅壁壘乎則在妥洽的外交政策與財政的關稅政策之下决不能容許有效的關稅壁壘之產生環境之矛盾若此乃欲高談統制經濟詎非夢蘟而虚玄幻想欲於枝枝節節的農村工作找求民族之出路吾人亦惟見其徒勞而巳</p>

<p>▲國民社十三日柏林電德意志普通報今日載其記者與日本出席日内瓦代表松岡氏之談話據松岡語德意報記者之言松岡在莫斯科不過係私人性質並無政治上之重要意味但彼承認曾乘此機會與蘇俄當局作不負責任之意見交換以期促進日俄兩國間之情誼而袪除各種誤會云云松岡氏復謂現日本人民對於蘇俄之見解巳頗有良好之進展而蘇俄對於日本之主張亦巳漸漸表示諒解故松岡氏覺蘇俄嗣後在日本所購買之貨品亦必逐漸增加如日本之各種製造品機器等均足爲蘇俄開關富源之用也松岡氏談話中復提及最近日俄煤油恊定及日本工程師在西比利亞各鐵道服務之事松岡對於各國之恐慌謂蘇俄將自各國手中攘奪世界之市場等等表示不信彼稱蘇俄現在人口巳增一萬六千萬其目前之急務爲供給國内人民之需要故與外界之競爭時期尙屬過早云松岡氏論及滿洲問題時對於近日日本與滿洲僞國所訂之條約竭力袒護但對於日本將有巨欵貸與僞國一事旣不表示否認亦不表示承認松岡氏僅稱僞國貿易情形至佳刻僞國軍隊約有十萬人俱由日本軍官敎練松岡氏最末謂國聯並非適宜之機關可以判决某一國應否爲他國所承認之事云普通報對於上述松岡氏之言論復加以評論謂松岡氏之言實過於客氣實則松在莫斯科與李維諾夫加拉罕賴德克等對於滿洲問題均有深長之計議而加拉罕不日或將親赴日本答謝松岡氏之過訪而日俄間新約之締結不日即可開始討論云</p>

<p>▲哈瓦斯社十二日印度馬德拉斯電英政府對於印度曾起革命風潮之地方加徵一種懲戒稅以致地方人民紛紛遷徒以避此稅尤以喀里喀達附近爲甚此等地方居民似曾全體請求政府以命令實行波拉協定（按此項恊定即印度人與賤民成立之恊定而使甘地停止絕食者）並廢除賤民階級所受之待遇但英國政府以此項問題關係印度之風俗習慣故不願干預對於居民之請求業已拒絕甘地黨徒不滿意英政府謂其政策直欲破壤印度人民對甘地之信仰至於印度之正宗派則集中勢力以與甘地對抗如甘地絕食則渠等亦以絕食應付之以故目下情形頗爲滑稽蓋雙方均以同樣手段以相報復也自殺之風日盛英政府或發表命令以禁止之甘地信徒擬率領賤民至寺院門前羣臥地上一致絕食而正宗派則羣集甘地所居之監獄門前亦以絕食相要脅云</p>
<p>▲國民社十二日普那電今日甘地在獄内接見美聯社記者表示若古魯梵由爾寺院不開放准賤民禮拜則渠復將於明年元旦絕食甘地此時仍瘦削枯槁體力尙未完全恢復</p>

<p>要聞</p>
<h3>日本發覺陰謀團體經過</h3>
<p>獨立靑年社勢力偉大</p>
<p>頭山秀三有密切關係</p>
<p>密輸武器圖擾我東北</p>
<p>日本通信右傾運動的危機在日本比左傾的危機恐怕事實上還大得多因爲右傾運動借名打倒左傾實際不光是牽着日本往後面退走幷且將打破現狀以至根本推翻議會政治都是很明顯的事實不過因爲他背後有現役軍人現役軍人背後有在鄕軍人會在軍國主義盛行的日本是沒有人敢過問的所以犬養毅以現任首相在光天化日之下居然在官邸被殺到現在幾乎半年了一般人還只知道犬養被刺而不知道刺客所以行刺犬養氏的内幕</p>
<p>不久以前赤色的刧掠運動其主持的人不過三人財產的損失也很有限雖然對日本社會引起了極大的不安究竟範圍還很小最近發生的一個案件那就更大得多了主持這個陰謀的團體是右傾團體中不甚著名的「獨立靑年社」他們想在這回秋季大演習期中刺殺當國首相齋藤實内大臣牧野伸顯宮内大臣一木喜德郎宮内次官關屋員三郎他們曾携帶着手槍跑到關西方面去未曾實行以前被警察發覺了其經過大體如次</p>
<p>獨立靑年社中心人物爲兒玉譽士夫年二十四歲是右傾團體最有能力的鬭士曾在一九二八年極力反對勞農黨的建立身懷建白書直接向日皇上訴而被處六個月之有期徒刑</p>
<p>岡田利平也是獨立靑年社的健者曾於一九二六年因美國的排日法案成立特别憤恨美國於是偷偷的跑進東京美國駐日大使館去把該大使館屋上所懸美國旗扯下來後又偷跑出去不曾被捕日警後來雖知道了也未深究</p>
<p>獨立靑年社由兒玉集合幾十個靑年組織成的其政治綱領大意如下</p>
<p>「一·尊王愛國爲吾輦行動之原理」</p>
<p>「一·須改革利巳意識所發露之資本主義政治家」</p>
<p>「一·討滅圖國體改革之赤色思想及行動併消滅一切非日本的兇惡思想」</p>
<p>就表面上看好像沒有什麽實際的行動也不過是一個左傾團體對立的思想團體而且是極幼穉尙未成熟的一種小組織特别是近來的東京以及其他幾個大都市這樣的小組織眞是像雨後春笋一般數不淸楚惟因當局者加以庇護於是乎更兇横起來最初不過是威嚇幾個金融資本家於現制度似乎沒有多大危險但是犬養被刺與右傾諸團體不無關係現時所破獲的獨立靑年社就與那件案子有很深切的關聯同時日本浪人派的老前輩頭山滿的兒子頭山秀三也有密切關係因此頭山住宅亦被檢查甚至天行會也被查看如此則日本右傾諸團體都不免要牽扯進去</p>
<p>此種陰謀决非短時期驟然醞釀更非偶然的不平結合以神戶方面的十三物品販賣輸出有限公司小田商店的主人小田東一手經理的買賣而論從一九二七年起表面上他是個留聲機器商人他用合法的手續從德國從匈牙利等國輸入到日本去的手槍五年之間其輸入數目有二十六七萬枝都把手槍分拆開來當作留聲機器的原料海關的人員旣不易察覺警察當然更難得知道了再加上與外國船舶相勾結在船未進口之前或旣進口之後用小汽船秘密接下來的在這五年以來秘密傳遞總計不下五十萬枝在日本這個有秩序有組織的國家裏不能不說是一件空前所未聞的奇事據他自己的新闻所載和警察的推測說是最大多數都輸出到東三省去了不錯近年來日本軍閥爲了要在東北搗亂借秩序不佳爲名好進兵攻略東北所以從他的右傾諸民民間團體以至於負主要責任的人都參與至少是知道這種秘密買賣幷且把這種買賣當作一種侵略的主要工上全面盡力聯絡白山黑水間的綠林豪客以擾亂中國的政治一面即借此扶殖日本帝國主義在東北的政治勢力他那裏料到東北三省的綠林反轉不肯給他作走狗更進一步要作一點民族的爭鬥縱然不足以打倒日本在東三省的統治不能即刻恢復失地但是却能夠動搖日本侵略東北的企圖能夠使所謂「滿洲傀儡國」不得穩定然則他這種秘密的販賣軍火（手槍一項就有五十萬枝）在東北去年九一八固然巳然搗出了極大的亂子現時還在繼續的搗下去不意這種秘密輸入（武器）買賣販到東三省之後又帶了許多回日本來他自己統計說是有二百三十枝秘密的輸到東京來由右傾的關係轉到左傾團體手中的至少有六七十枝但這只是一部分已發現了的情實恐怕再經過相當時日繼續偵察下去還有更奇異的東西暴露出來（一九三二·十一月·八日於東京）</p>

<p>起步時浩浩蕩蕩七時五十分卡德路口列一字之陣點名旣畢由張信孚信槍一擊數百飛毛腿舉步齊飛直向靜安寺進發長蛇一線遂分前後過靜安寺其地爲一英里居首者張造九其後葛錦文張志和陳立文呂崇義姚亞影呂文俠等起步不久尙不知誰先誰後</p>
<p>▲徐靄臣一馬當先入極　非而路中張志和躍張造九出而居第一呂文俠徐靄臣葛錦文張造九不前不後並駕齊屬將達兆豐花園徐靄臣又超越張志和而居第一以三十碼之遙前領形勢優越大有奪標氣槪於是一路順風直于貝當路方生變化</p>
<p>▲虹橋路上之一瞥光豐花園爲程二哩半白利南路而沿霍必蘭路折入虹橋路爲程六英里佔全程之半三哩之中變化未生葛錦文呂文俠稍微落後造九遂列第三林肯路口造九又越張志和而居第二矣徐靄臣則始終一氣居最前　導及入虹橋路張志和又落而爲第五矣其時最前之秩序爲㈠徐靄臣㈡張造九㈢呂文俠㈣葛錦文㈤張志和個人與團體錦標似已判定大半張呂葛皆滬西甲之健將也</p>
<p>▲貝當路上之變化如是前進經同女書院交通大學折北入海格路再向西南而走貝當路錦標形勢頓生變化此最後之三英里極大之變化發生達二次葛錦文加緊速度一步接一步旣超過呂文俠張造九復越徐靄臣爲第一矣與徐一番競爭超前落後凡二次堪稱全程最精彩之一幕葛毫不放鬆緊釘徐之後亞爾培路向南葛復超徐出前方如此復方則王兆祥越張造九張志和上前矣</p>

<h3>女子創舉</h3>
<p>女子從前未有之競走昨日竟告實現男子十三英里旣畢女子一英里繼之十一時開始點名列隊鳴笛起步繞場四圈然以訓練尙少姿勢不佳者有之連跑帶跳者有之以致劉文靖雖獲第一因犯規三次而被取消資格</p>
<p>▲毫無變化開步後第一圈劉文靖即飛步而去速度甚大於是疑其有帶跑者經此一挫稍見緩慢然劉仍居前其後差尺寸爲成先之三圈之次序毫無變化直至最後一圈才定前後前三圈之次序爲劉文靖成先之張佩綸黃鎭琦張寳瑾吳世英葉明郭蓮妮等相互之距離皆二三尺</p>
<p>▲落選可惜到達終點時劉文靖與成先之並肩而來劉文靖以二寸之前居首成先之次之而張寳瑾則躍居第三惟裁判之决定則以劉三次犯規警告而不改第一次不得不嚴厲執行遂取消資格以成先之拔升第一不勝爲劉可异尙望下次再行努力女子以事創舉觀者皆倍加注意末後由沈嗣良給獎而散</p>

<h3>婦女職業在歐陸</h3>
<p>— 人倫</p>
<p>丨寫在中國女子職業之前丨</p>
<p>在歐洲婦女職業已極普遍，上至公司經理，下至報販郵差，無不有女子挿足；巴黎公共寓所的門房，大都是女的。從來男子所占有之地位，在歐洲一半已被女子奪了去，其原因：一以歐洲女子較多於男子，因數理的必然之結果，女子便不得不謀自立；一爲歐洲生活費之騰貴與女子虚榮心之增長，一方面男子避免結婚而不能結婚之女子遂日多</p>
<p>「自己賺來自己化去！」之理由下，伊們所得工資大都任意消費，尤因親子兄弟姊妹之個人主義之盛行，如我國一般子女以所得交之父母而再向父母手中領取用費之事，可謂絕對無之至於伊們消費之傾向；第一爲裝飾，爲虚榮心之束縛，不顧身分，務使自己之服飾益趨時尙；尤以達相當年齡血氣未定之靑年女子，醉心自由而不能辨善惡，隨時有被誘惑之可能，而伊們亦正專爲被誘惑而極意裝飾；每逢假日，足跡遍戲院舞場，以少量之所得，實無足夠之理。</p>
<p>柏林惠而街之勸工塲，即我國所謂百貨商店裏，此類女店員，多至數千人，彼等之醜態，更非在遠東所可見，據聞此輩百分之八十爲花柳病患者。某次德報所載在某百貨商店内竟發見私生兒，據調查之結果，知爲某女店員所遺棄，於是該店遂舉行全店員之體格總檢查，結果令人可驚者，在一千女店員中，完全健康者，祇有二人，此外竟全爲花柳病患者，而此僅有之二健康者爲十五與十二歲之小姑娘。</p>
<p>諸如此類之事件，並不限於德國之勸工塲爲然，其他銀行之事務員，郵局之女售票員，在歐洲各國，均有此類風氣，即風氣比較嚴正之英格蘭，愛爾蘭亦所不免，祇有質的不同而量則無異也。觀此，女子職業尙在幼穉的我們中國，在熱烈提倡中不得不知所注意。</p>
<h3>月經無妨婦女職業</h3>
<p>— 張珠鳳</p>
<p>丨吾人毋再存此舊歐念丨</p>
<p>自來反對婦女與男子競爭職業者，莫不謂女子在生理上有天然智力缺陷之特種原因，而爲男子所無者，即月經是也。此種觀念，不獨我國人有之，即西方之守舊派，亦多堅信不移，如哈利生（F.Harrison）之言曰：「縱認男女一切能皆相等，然月經一至，則顯有兩性任事能力之差異」。一九○九年，俄人福茲高夫斯基且公言其試騐結果王漢倫女士施美</p>
<p>容術時之神情</p>
<p>漢倫女士爲著名影星，自脫離電影界後，曾在巴黎專研　容術，返國後設「漢倫美容院」於霞飛路樹婦女職業之先聲。（申報攝影社）</p>
<p>，謂月經對於某種心理確有影響，其實殊不信，蓋其試騐時僅爲婦女六人，而此六人又均知其目的，是以不能流露眞情，且其試騐之詳細經過，亦未述及，故不能即認其結論無誤也。</p>
<p>一九一四年，安諾爾德博士（Dr.AEArnold）研侒其女弟子與月經之關係於美國體育雜誌一月號披露其詳細經過，被根據其爲醫爲師之經騐，認爲凡女學生若因月經而不上課，實無科學上之可靠理由。同時，又有女醫博士賀林瓦絲（HollingWorth）對於婦女月經問題，就智覺與意志動作之速度，以及穩定性與疲勞性，等等方面，作長期詳密之試騐，結果由所試之二十三人證明，月經確無妨婦女智力之發展。準此以論則不能以月經爲婦女之弱點，而强謂女子因此即不配從事專門職業也。</p>
<p>但實際上至今尙有不少有智識之婦女，囿於舊說，益以社會上岐視之惡習由來已久，心理上遂不免自餒，而竟願示讓於男子；則殊可慨也。考目前社會上婦女，職業不發達之原因，雖屬多端，即此種舊觀念之根深蒂固，且爲婦女界中之智識分子所堅信不移；斯誠故步自封，不知努方者之態度也。苟其不然，則新婦女當早除此種舊心理也。</p>
<p>試觀彼主張婦女因月經而需有讓男子者，何以不任其家所僱之女工，於月經來時，准其暫作休息？醫院中之看護婦，亦未有因月經大至而得以暫息仔肩；思之，不亦大可晒耶？</p>
<p>謹按：本文多根據前述之賀林瓦絲女醫博士之論文，節錄意譯而成，讀其文者，莫不感其有積極提倡婦女職業之精神；愧我不能達其十一，</p>
<h3>婦女職業的兩重障碍</h3>
<p>— 芮禹成</p>
<p>丨一是嫁人以後二是生了孩子丨</p>
<p>在習俗相沿重男輕女的中國社會裏，大槪對於婦女都懷著兩種不良的心理：一種是將她們當作男性洩慾的玩具，彷彿和娼妓一般：一種是將她們視爲家室服役的苦力，好像是婢僕一樣。可憐女性在這種侮辱以下屈居了數千年之久，現在才算能夠揚眉吐氣丨人們都在高唱著男女平等之歌，竭力打破了兩性的關攔，絕對使男女立在同等的地位。因此，婦女也有服務社會的機會了但是，在現實的社會制度之下，婦女職業仍舊脫不了兩重難關，使她們終於不能一直地努力下去：</p>
<p>凡是在庇蔭之下的少女，求學或是服務大槪都是不成問題的；因爲伊們絲毫不負家庭任何的責任，所謂「吃飯張嘴，睡覺伸腿」。多金之家固然有婢僕伺候，貧寒的也有父母代勞，絕不忍心敎愛女去費些微的力量。可是一旦嫁了丈夫以後，嚴厲的翁姑之下，嫉妬的妯娌之間，無論如何，總不能容你早出晚歸，完全坐受物質的享用；於是嫁人以後的婦女，除非是在小家庭裏而且丈夫必須極端的諒解，才可於職業無碍；否則只有辭退看家，調充主持中饋的太太了第一重難關縱然闖過，但一經生了孩子，這第二重阻攔恐怕再也過不去了！乳娘的撫養總不及自己領帶的當心，除非縫一口袋，將孩子背在後和母親同出同歸，可是這樣怎能做得到呢？我所以認爲婦女職業前途要得平坦無阻，就非設計剷掉這兩重難關不行！</p>

<h3>南湖的船娘</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>丨健康美勝遇摩登女丨</p>
<p>當您走到嘉興的車站旁，擺出一副優游玩賞的樣子，便有不少的異性圍住了您阿　擺渡？到烟雨樓去嗎？嬌聲的呼喚着。其中也有老年的婆婆；也有靑春的少婦；更有妙齡的姑娘，就伊們職業上講，我們不分老小，混稱伊一聲船娘罷了。</p>
<p>講到船娘的服裝，伊們是勞工，當然比不上小姐們的人時，但也收拾得整齊淸潔。伊們的膚色，受了那風吹日炙，當然談不上白嫩兩字，但是伊們圓圓的手臂，粗粗的脚脛，棕色的肉彩，很合時下流行的「健康美」三個字。</p>
<p>伊們的職業，便是搖着一隻小船，渡那客人　逛烟雨樓。伊們每天的收入，也不一定，好的時候，便是熱天，來回一趟要一元，總有三四元的收入。冷落的時候，三四毛錢也要去，那便悽慘了。</p>
<p>南湖是一個很圓整的湖，好像一面琉璃鏡，可惜四面沒有靑山，那也是老天不成全它，不然它也要和西湖比一比高低咧。湖的中央，有一座烟雨樓，層樓疊閣，垂楊籠罩，風景很是不差。炎熱的時候，駕一葉扇舟，到樓中來乘凉，更是合冝。所以船娘靠這湖水，靠這層樓，尤其是炎炎的長夏，着實賺一筆錢咧。</p>
<p>「人老珠黃不値錢」。在勞工的船娘，一定也有這種感嘆，老婦·少婦，伊們搖一次船，不大見錢。年靑而時髦的姑娘却不對了，因此便造成了許多罪惡。這因爲有些浮薄少年們，他們假遊湖坐船爲名，實行那調笑勾搭的行動，所謂「醉翁之意不在酒」，便是這種人們。而在船娘們呢，不費氣力，樂得多掙一些錢，而全不想對於勞工有玷，這種「婦女職業之蠹」，深望地方人士，加以制裁綫對。</p>
<p>操船娘的，大都是本地鄕村中的女子，黃髮赤足，膚色微黑，很有一種天然的風韻。南湖穩着半湖的菱，在那菱花香裏，襯着嬌健的船娘，很有一種畫意和詩景。「宜遠觀而不可　玩」，是我所希望於遊客們的。</p>
<h3>婦女職業問題的研究</h3>
<p>— 螈退</p>
<p>「敎育」究是最急切的工作丨</p>
<p>民國光復之初有女子革命軍，女子參政會，其後均曇花一現，不能確立女子職業的基礎。現在各院部，各省廳均有女職員，如科員、如書記，雖伊們辦事的材力智識，並不下於男職員而外間無識之徒，輙稱之爲紅花瓶，以其僅供裝飾無裨於實用。</p>
<p>還有公司商店，欲廣招徠，亦多雇用女招待，女店員。在安時之用意，未嘗不注意於女子職業，遷流所及，竟有皇后之推選，則非始料之所及。我的主張，所謂女子職業問題者非少數之女子，委曲於婚姻，有待於婦女部之救濟。中國全部之女子，約在二萬萬之巨數，除高年之老婦及初生之女嬰不計外，中年之婦女、及少年之女子，總在一萬萬左右，其中讀書識字者，萬人之中，不知有一二人否？所以現在研究女子職業應先普及敎育，尤其是提倡女子半日學校爲第一先决問題。</p>
<p>記在南京時，家中有女婢七八人，此七八女婢者，非由金錢買來，乃是男女僕人之女兒，白吃間椀，稍供役使，此固大家庭之常事，而其性質則屬慈善。値余臥疾家居，遂每日敎以讀書習字，所有鄰家之小大子，及少年之女傭，願來附讀，一律敎授，此項學堂無以名之，名之曰里巷婦女半日小學。其課本係由余購送，助敎則添聘四人，以學校雖名半日，其實由晨至夜，開至八班，因爲這係婢傭，都有伊們應做的事，所以每次開講，以伊們人數爲斷。如果能推行全國·需用女敎員之數甚多。在昔女子是以紡織爲業，現在有了機器，女子終日無事可做，有的作作小工。必須中國女子人人能識字，或種田，或作工，或開店，纔有生路可走。這所謂全國大多數女子職業的問題，不是少數摩登女子所研究的事吧！</p>
<h3>婦女職業與待遇</h3>
<p>— 針</p>
<p>丨關係種族健康丨</p>
<p>現代各種業務上，都有優異的女性人才出現：婦女職業的可能，自是不成問題，但據科學者研究的結果，婦女生理上缺陷的顧慮，也不可忽略的，據伊亭博士考察一九一九年至一九二二年間瑞京斯篤可爾姆的女工和較高階級婦女的生產狀况的比較，發見女工的受孕可能性，比較上層階級的婦女低百分之二十五，而女工的嬰兒死亡率，則比較上層階級的婦女高出百分之二十六：見東方雜誌復刋號丨丨這種母性病的流行，營養不良，固屬原因之一，而更不好的是長時間的坐成立，會使女子骨盤的發育受打擊。這一種危害，不僅及於婦女本身，而且要影響到種族。</p>
<p>這不是婦女職業本身的缺陷，這是現社會制度的不良丨丨職業婦女待遇的不良，所以要免去這一種危害，唯一的方法是改善待遇：</p>
<p>㈠工作時間减少，</p>
<p>㈡工作酬金加多，</p>
<p>㈢改善女工的設備，</p>
<p>㈣分娩前後須有相當的休養。</p>
<p>古諺：「求人不如求己」，一方面固須政治的或社會的力置爲援助，一方面仍須婦女自己的團結與努力。</p>
<h3>日本婦女職業的分類</h3>
<p>— 斌</p>
<p>丨可分智力技術體力等四項丨</p>
<p>提高女權，實行男女平等，提倡婦女職業，在這二十世紀的新中國已是高唱入雲了！可是現在一般新女子，伊們憑着一股熱血的衝動，四處奔走呼號，鼓吹婦女職業，到後來，也不見多大的效果。</p>
<p>舊雨戎君文言，留學東瀛，上年因憤國難而返國，一昨無意邂逅，彼此促膝談心，後戎君談起東京的女子職業，很發達，現在把他分述於下。</p>
<p>據戎君言，東京的女子職業，約分四種：</p>
<p>㈠運用智力的：如中小學敎員，幼穉園保姆，家庭敎師，女醫生，女店伙，事務員，郵員，賣票員，女記者，女偵探，圖書館管理員，婦女看守等：</p>
<p>㈡運用技術的：如打字員，助產員，計算手，看護婦，美容師，裁縫師，電話司機，圖案師，理髮師，電信員等；㈢運用智力兼技術的：如優伶，女明星·音樂師·畫家·琴師·等；</p>
<p>㈣運用體力的：如派出婦·（猶如吾國之女傭·）摸特兒，女待者，旅館女中，（女中即女僕，）女工，等。</p>
<p>上面四種，不過舉其大槪，只因限於篇幅，只得從略。</p>
<h3>婦女職業的商榷</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>『花缾』啦，『活招牌』啦，未免侮辱了女性，女子的有職業·難道便可以囊視麽？我想：女子的職業，可分三種：第一種是當敎員；第二種是做商人；第三種是做女工。從前女子沒有自立能力·依賴男子，何等束縛—在男子一方面呢，負擔也非常之重；所以生了女子·都說是『賠錢貨』。要是女子有了職業，能自立，旣輕男子的負擔，又使自己能自由，眞是最良好的方法。况且，目下女子的婚姻問題，很難解决。父母做主嗎？結果，往往不良：高的配不上，低的不願就，眞是做父母的一椿難事要是女子有了職業，當然有了社交，自身的婚姻問題，也比較容易解决；所以女子『職業問題』，和『婚姻問題』有密切的關係呢。</p>
<p>要提倡婦女職業，先要提倡女子敎育；所以做父母的，必須使女兒入學讀書，以便將來找尋高尙的職業。要是沒受充分的敎育，那裏找得着好的職業呢！婦女有了職業，一方面仍舊要研究家政，主持家事，萬不可置家政於不顧。同時，必須工讀並顧，業餘應當增進智能，讀書學工，雙方並進。那末，可找到更好的職業，前途尤有希望了。</p>
<h3>婦女職業的沒落</h3>
<p>— 王定九</p>
<p>時代的高湖。形成婦女們的幸運。大隊娘子軍。打着鮮明旗幟浩浩蕩蕩。和男子們對疊。站上同一水平線。「婦女職業」。便是厮殺聲中的一條生路！</p>
<p>解放後的新婦女。初時很有一番作爲。可是瞻顧現在的情狀。又不免使人慨嘆。伊們的前途日趨沒落！</p>
<p>事實告訴吾們。所云「婦女職業」。依舊是四字標榜。眞能切實爲本身職業樹立基礎展拓地盤的萬綠叢中一點紅罷。不然。機關女職員何以有「花瓶」之誚。大部的婦女。還趨炎拜金。甘爲男子的玩物呢？</p>
<p>因此。「婦女職業」的結果。才高的便成「官太太」。下駟的流爲「女招待」。姊妹們都向　落道上鑽。不向成功路上奔。從沒有到西北去的奇女子。却都在妝台前下功夫！</p>
<p>話說回來，我們男子也當負一部責任。不該做「婦女職業」的摧殘者。應本人類互助的精神。捐除猬褒的思想。抛棄袖手的態度。無礙「婦女職業」的進展。以臻共存共榮之境。</p>
<p>姊妹們更當認淸現在的嚴重局面。危機一髮。男子都要執干戈以衛社稷了。你們應負後方的全責。貫澈眞實的「安内攘外」。列國「婦女職業」的這樣蓬勃。便是歐洲大戰所造成。千載一時的機會已在目前。努力吧！</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>（婦妇職業，早已公認爲現代婦女問題中最占重要性之一。本刊特爲編一專號，公開討論，以引起婦女界的興奮。我們在事先决定公開徵稿並訪問專家的意見，所謂意見，是注重實際，不尙空談。於是，紫羅蘭盦主人便想起一位海上名媛現方提倡婦女職業最力的雲裳公司總理譚雅聲夫人丨甘金榮女士來。經他介紹之後，譚夫人很高興，便邀我去參觀雲裳，並談到有關婦女職業的問題。）</p>

<p>譚夫人劈頭就說：「我接辦雲裳之初，有三個動機，從我心弦上發出來；我自己很懺悔，爲什麽不在我的黃金時代，便開始爲社會服務，而到如今綫初期嘗試其中的滋味？我不能做婦女職業的先導者，反爲現代婦女的落後者，豈不自漸！」伊復換口氣說；「不過，普通女子在脫離學校即投身於職業界，我則把家庭的責任，盡了相當的義務，再來償我夙願，這是第一個動機。年來我國社會經濟的衰落，已成江河日下之勢，最大的原因，也許是爲了洋貨傾銷，利　外溢；所以提倡國貨，不容再緩。我很想改良婦女的服裝，改用國貨的材料，轉移婦女界崇尙洋貨的錯念，這是第二個動機。雲裳是文藝界諸位先生費了幾許心血的產物，如由它無人負責，而聽其自然演化，結果是辜負了許多人的願望，我便决心把它中興起來，這是第三個動機。」</p>
<p>聯想到婦女裝飾</p>
<p>在這裏，我又聯想到婦女的裝飾。現代婦女，在服裝上，美容上，爭奇門妍，已是普遍的心理了；其中，給我發現了幾種有趣的事實：有一種　歐化的婦女，伊心目中所需要的衣料或化妝品，一定要買來路貨才稱心，譬如袍料，國貨喬其紗不買，偏要買洋貨萊司；國貨皮裘，如狐皮灰背不買，要買洋貨司　克，諸如此類崇尙洋貨的心理，眞是莫名其妙。有一種婦女的服飾，太不合理化，伊們要時髦，好修飾，而不曾注意穿什麽衣服，適宜於何種塲合？在什麽時令，應穿那一種衣飾？這上面所說卽是所謂不合理化的意思？除非你穿的是普通衣服，到沒甚關係，否則早晨，午前，午後，晚間，都有一定的格式。譬如摩登的小姐或太太們，白天穿了夜禮服，加上灰背皮大衣，穿着金色皮鞋，這樣眩耀的時裝，到大宴會或跳舞廳去本不足奇；要如跑到王寳和酒樓或五芳齋麫館去豈不是令人笑話？所以我以爲婦女的服飾，不講究則已，旣講究了，必須合理化，尤其在公共埸所，更爲重要。</p>
<p>婦女職業的展望</p>
<p>我對於婦女職業，向來很有興趣，因爲以前錯過了機會，所以對於有職業的女性很羡慕，也抱有很大的希望。現在我來分析出三種婦女：㈠已出嫁的婦女；㈡正在職業界的婦女；㈢在求學時代凖備謀職業的女子。我對伊們所抱的希望，凡已嫁的婦女，對家政的處理，丈夫的恩　，子女的撫育，責任非常重要。精治家之道，爲賢妻良母，已盡了女子的天職，雖不在職業界服務，而伊對社會國家的貢獻，已屬非常重大，固不必拘拘於在外服務的；已在職業界的婦女，應該堅定意志，尊重自身的地位與信譽，勿爲金錢所誘，勿爲情感所迷，要打破當前惡環境的包圍，闢一條光明大道；在求學時代的女子，應先考量自己的志願與景况，早爲凖備，學識充裕了，待人接物應世的方法學好了，一到社會，自無格格不入的困難。</p>
<p>尋常習見的弊病</p>
<p>職業界多數女同志，都能奮發向上，但同時又發現了幾種弊病，例如：㈠好事時髦，過於修飾，給人們加了紅花瓶的雅號；㈡對職務少責任心；㈢爲了虚榮心，往往見異思遷，沒有恒心；㈣出外服務，而放棄了家庭的天職。我來舉個例吧：某夫人是很有才學的，自接任某省府的秘書之後，出入必須汽車，手面非常闊綽，月入俸金，還不足自給；把家裏的子女，付託女傭，毫不照顧，阿囡整天的啼飢號寒，阿大阿二不是和隔壁鄰兒吵嘴打架，定是跌破了額角頭皮；像這樣得不償失的幹，誤解了婦女職業的眞義，誰都不會贊成的吧？</p>
<p>譚夫人談得很起勁，可惜時間不早，繼告一段落。</p>

<p>三三養老金條例之任何修正其條件上應有愼重之限制俾不至鼓勵職員因欲領取依照服務年數比例計算之一份部養老金而從早引退鄙人以爲給付此種養老金應有下列兩種條件之限制</p>
<p>（甲）職員經供職若干確定年數以後非因行爲不當而被迫退職者或</p>
<p>（乙）因服務條件之有重要改革致於該員發生損害而自願退職者</p>
<p>三四上文所擬養老金條例之各種規定不能完全達到所有目的綠有關係各職員之養老金利益雖能因此得有保障但對於任期保障至多僅有間接效力</p>

<h3>裝洋</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>丨處世藝術之九丨</p>
<p>裝洋二字，頗爲流行，但洋字究不知如何寫法，到底銀洋之洋呢？還是陰陽之陽？若作陽字，是陰性而表示陽性之意，或是表示光明偉大之意。若作洋字，是洋氣十足，表示歡化之产电，二說均有可通·惟我翻遍字典辭源，無此名目，大約係新名詞，編纂辭源諸先生，當在漏萬之例也但是在此通商鉅埠中流行，當以後說爲近，故用洋字，</p>
<p>裝洋，亦是搭架子之意，架子要辣，辣便有人看得起，洋要裝得足，足便有人去羨慕，此洋之所以不能不裝也，芝蔴綠荳官去見上司，今天不見，明日不見，表示他們十分神氣不如此不足以擺出要人們的威風，裝洋醫生，情願躱在家裏抱小兒，和叉麻雀，病家來請，非等到下午六七時不肯光臨，裝洋公司商店中的夥計，三聲問他不應，四聲問他不答，（汽車階級和摩登女郎例外），不如此不足以裝出寳號大夥計的樣子，裝洋然共請酒，更是討厭，邀柬去不來，電話打去不來，如其寫明午時入席他非一二時不肯光顧，假定到後，吃一二菜即去不如此不足以表示應酬的繁忙，總而言之，應酬以遲到先去爲原則，窰子裏呌紅倌人一樣，這也是裝洋，荷花大少，每月賺十六隻大洋，十五元九角穿在身上裝洋，</p>
<p>裝洋的事例很多，我僅舉其數端言之，這原是我國國民的劣根性，完全是一種虚驕之氣，完全是一種作僞態度，洋人天然裝洋，然而他們的時間非常信守，做商意非常客氣，裝洋的地方，果然裝洋，而不裝洋的地方，原是絕不裝洋不若我國，無論何事，無論何人，一味裝洋，搭盡架子，眞是討氣　，</p>
<p>在此惡劣的環境之中，何不去改造一下，打破此惡劣環竟，不興，假定你有人請客，準時而到，他們必定要笑，此口酒還沒有吃過，所以老早駕臨，若醫生一請就到，他們便要笑，一定生意淸淡，所以十分把結，中國人嘴巴最歹不曉得自己的壞處，想法去改善，偏要把他人的好處，完全破壞，以同汚流俗而後快，此中國之所以爲中國人歟</p>

<h3>鴛湖櫂歌</h3>
<p>— 買千陣</p>
<p>阿儼生小住湖濱，水色常分眉黛顰，一棹輕盈畫中去，伴郎撤綱捉銀鱗，</p>
<p>不是吳中驚　湖，鴛鴦兩字耐人呼，船梢越女掉雙漿，送客游時過綠蒲，</p>
<p>光陰逝水　難覺，採罷蓮花採菱角，歌曲聲聲蕩漿來，錯疑湖上聽仙樂</p>
<p>楊柳陰中水之曲，臨流頻見鴛鴦浴，鴛鴦與妾作比隣，年年相對湖波綠，</p>

<h3>魚肝油</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>魚肝油·大家都知道是一樣滋補的食品；因爲它含有維他命甲和丁能助發育；並含有易於消化的有機酸（Jecoleic及Theropicacids），所以早已公認爲補品了。</p>
<p>魚肝油是從鱉魚的肝中提出，故名。鱉魚多在挪威附近的海邊。捉得後，取其肝置水中共沸之，油較水輕，浮於水面；取出過濾，以去雜質，即得淸魚肝油。</p>
<p>凡是油類，各有特殊之嗅氣。尤以魚肝油的氣味最令人難受：因之無臭的乳，白魚肝油，甜味的麥精魚肝魚，滋補的雞蛋魚肝油，膠殼的魚肝魚丸等，應運而生。因其各有長處，售價甚貴；然自製之，亦非一件難事。</p>
<p>市上所售魚肝油，常攙雜他種汕類，面得善價，可以下列之法檢騐之：㈠魚肝油過發烟硝酸呈玫瑰色。㈡若加濃硫酸，先呈紫色，搖之變棕色。</p>
<p>甲，乳白魚肝油</p>
<p>這是應用物理的性質，把油類混以樹膠及水，做成白色乳劑。和水冲之，像牛乳，無油滴浮在液面，亦無魚肝油之腥氣。且乳劑較純油容易爲腸吸收，故功效亦大。</p>
<p>製法：取魚肝油四份和亞拉伯樹膠粉一份，放在乳鉢中研匀：加水二份，同時，不絕調磨，數分鐘後，妈可潔白的乳白魚肝油。手續簡單，不難實行？製造大量，須用機器。西文名Homogenizer</p>
<p>若須香味，可隨意混入。</p>
<p>原理：樹膠過水，立刻膨脤：並有黏性，好像膠水。但與油無變化，故先以樹膠和油混合，再以水一次加入，樹膠膨脹後溶化成黏液；同時不絕研磨，把油分成極細小的滴滴，爲水包圍，因深液有黏性，各油滴不能凝合；所以無魚肝油之嗅氣。若研之不匀，必有嗅氣存在且置放久之，仍將分爲水與油爲二層。製時須注意：㈠樹膠須乾燥之粉末；量水之器未揩乾時，不得量油；同樣，量油之器，須乾燥後始得量水。㈡水宜一次加入，始無粒塊之生</p>
<p>㈢若首次失敗，油與樹膠及水之混合物，勿必棄去，可加入良好之乳劑中，磨之仍得同一效果。</p>
<p>乙，麥精魚肝油</p>
<p>麥精就是麥芽糖，牠的好處有三：</p>
<p>㈠味甜，常人皆喜訜，</p>
<p>㈡含有一種酵母，能使澱粉變成麥茅糖於人身很容易吸收。</p>
<p>含有易於消化之物，如麥芽糖及少量其他的糖。</p>
<p>中國之凈糖，品質與麥精相同：但經高溫度烘燒，已無酵母，失去助消化的功效。</p>
<p>麥精的製法，已經呂子偉君在本刋述過，勿再贅言了。</p>
<p>製法：以六克亞拉伯樹膠·與十二克甘油在乳鉢中混合，加四十克麥精，調匀：加十五克魚肝油，調交；再加二十克麥精與十五克魚肝油，研至細而均匀爲止。若須香味，可隨意加之。</p>
<p>丙，雞蛋魚肝油，</p>
<p>雞蛋是補品之一，再加富有滋養的魚肝油，確有很大的滋補力：但雞蛋易腐不能保久，這是它的缺點。</p>
<p>製法：和乳白魚肝油的原理相似：用蛋黃代替樹膠。以十克蛋黃加一百</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>克魚肝油，在一乳鉢中研磨之，即得淡黃色之乳劑。</p>
<p>欲防腐敗，可略加百分之五的火酒，或安息香酸。</p>
<p>丁，魚肝油丸，</p>
<p>魚肝油丸，無特殊效用，祇能避免魚肝油的嗅氣而已。</p>
<p>製法；以純膠Gelatine。融化之，用模型做成一粒粒葡萄狀的殼子·再加魚肝油，而封之即得。</p>

<h3>句讀的笑話</h3>
<p>— 禹成</p>
<p>鄕間有一個不識字的人，不知爲了什麽原故，他竟發了横財，而正在榮華快樂的妻子，忽然染病而亡，斷絃以後，他當然還要續娶，幷且誓必娶一個美貌的女子，樂享愛情的幸福。</p>
<p>這個消息傳到一個土棍的耳裏，就來專誠地拜訪，土棍道：「我有一個朋友的妹妹，長得眞像天仙臨凡，我倒想替你做媒，可是你預備送我幾何的酬報？</p>
<p>」邢人笑道，「眞的嗎？那末就费費你的心了，我决定送你兩百塊大洋」，土棍道：「在我在我，包你成功，但你先要送我的酬報，然後我再去做媒！那人躊躇道：「這却不能，或者讓我先看一看姑娘。」土棍道：「姑娘假使瞧見你這樣土頭土腦的，她一定拚死也不肯嫁你，我只有瞞着她，怎好讓你去看呢。不過你儘管放心，我可以寫一張包票給你」。談論而此，就算終結，那人付了土棍二百塊錢，土棍也當面寫了一張包票交給那人收執。</p>
<p>包票上寫的是：「麻子全無頭髮漆黑脚也不大好看」那人問道：「包票上寫著什麽？請你念一遍」！土棍念道：「麻子全無，頭髮漆黑，脚也不大，好看！」那人聽了，非常得意，靜候幸福的來臨，</p>
<p>光陰過得眞快，那人終朝盼望的天仙似的新娘，居然娶進門了，送房後揭去面巾一看，直把那人嚇煞，氣冲冲地到鄰莊上去向土棍駡道：「你這活騙子！什麽天仙臨凡，簡直是妖怪下世，你包标上寫的什麽？現在怎會變成一個又麻又癙又是黑皮又是猪爪子脚的人呢」？說著就扭住土棍，要去打官司，村裏的人也都聚攏來了，</p>
<p>土棍從容地道：「諸位聽我說兩句，我若是無理，當然願受處罰，且不要去見官廳，我包票上明明地寫得淸楚，這是他願意娶的，不信，敎他將包票拿出來看」，那人一聽這話，就勇氣百倍地將包票取了出來，土棍憑著大衆道：「諸位也有識字的，請看這上面不是寫得明白嗎？」說著就念道，「麻子，全無頭髮，漆黑，脚也不好看」。衆人點頭稱是，那人只才知道上了圈套，有苦說不出來。惟有長吁短嘆地回家，同那個又麻又癙又是黑庋又是猪爪子脚的新娘睡覺，一切幸福的迷夢，這時才完全淸醒了！</p>

<h3>昇平氣象</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>昨承老友王君送來請柬一份，幷附入塲劵二紙；呌我去看游藝。那請柬上這樣寫着，</p>
<p>本社茲定于×月×日起，至×日至，假座××路×社，舉行彩排三天。</p>
<p>敬請觀光××集啓</p>
<p>我看了之後，不禁贊嘆，我中國人眞會作樂，自劉阿斗李後主以來，未改乎此度，眞不愧爲一古文明的國家。天災不足懼！外侮不足憂，而樂却不可不尋，不見「阿拉」三北，剛化一二百萬來賽一個會，而滬上人士，又復得覩霓裳羽衣之盛，豈非盛事！大槪，娛樂不忘救國，丨不救國不忘娛樂；這一個信條，已能像憲法一樣，得到多數人民的信守，口號而能見諸實行，這是一個可喜的現象，我眞爲大中華民國前作慶幸，有人動不動京說中國人「窮」「苦」這全不符事實，旣有大會可出，又有好戲可看，窮苦的影子究在那裏，本來窮富，苦樂，惟有程度上的差别，不是絕對的名詞，誰能在兩者中間劃上一刀，一剖兩半呢？沒有飯吃，我就吃粥，沒有粥吃，我就喝湯，奪去了江蘇，還有浙江，奪去了浙江，還有福建，地上不能住，住到山上，山上不能住，住到飛機上，除了滅亡，向後儘有退步哩，記得法國小說家焦爾士威奴曾說過下面幾句話，「沒有車子，我就騎馬，沒有馬騎，我就用脚走，沒有了脚，我就用手爬，沒有手，我就用肚皮滾，」中國人向後退的精神，却也有此勇氣，</p>
<p>享樂本是人類一種天生的慾望，不過須以「吃苦」爲前題，要知淸潔的街道，是由淸道夫的滿身齷龊所造成的，但中國人太聰明了，只知享樂，而不肯吃苦，丨他人给欠們吃的苦頭，當然不算，丨結果，弄得一人快活，萬衆愁苦，一日歡樂，三百六十四日縐眉，這眞何苦來！</p>
<p>寫到這裏，有人對我說，雖只一日的歡樂終勝於終年的縐眉，愁能傷身，　得解　，我說我不去拿槍伏在寫字檯上寫稿，日十分解　了，獨在冰天雪地中奮鬥的義勇軍，太不達觀，不肯解　何，這大槪是氣候的關係，北方天冷，他們的腦筋　許已凍得有些麻木了，否則北方人，京戲總得愛聽，幾時我眞想請全國名票名伶到東北去犒軍，送一點「昇平氣象」到塞外去，</p>

<h3>騙老婆</h3>
<p>— 鳳沼</p>
<p>前天晚上十點鐘的時候，我正在伏着桌子寫信，一陣樓梯聲，只聽得後樓的王先生，帶毃帶喊的說：「瑞英丨瑞英丨開開門！」接着就是砰！砰！的兩聲，但是房裏的王夫人瑞英女士，却是好像睡着了一般，一些聲息都沒有，王先生盡管敲着喊着，裏邊却儘是不睬他，足足有五分鐘以後，王先生的敲聲急了，！砰！砰丨連敲了五六下子，那門已不待人開自然地下來了，這時候的我，預料今天後樓的夫妻倆！致少要演半齣的全武行，不料這位王先生·非但沒有生氣，反而平心靜氣的陪着笑臉說：「瑞英丨瑞英丨你生氣了嗎？你爲什麽不開門！」那位瑞英女士就帶哭帶怨的說：「我同你倆，結婚才有三個月多些，我的錢巳經被你化夠了，到現在你知道我的錢快沒有，你的行動也就不對了，三天沒有回家，你究竟在什麽地方？幹些什麽事？唉！你自己問問良心罷！」說罷！她就嗚咽地哭起來，那位王先生還是帶着笑聲，細語溫言的說着長短，這時候我也聽不淸楚他們倆的争辯，一面就繼續地做我的工作，</p>
<p>第二天淸早，王先生又神氣活演笑容滿面的出去了，到晚上仍舊沒有回來，人靜的時候，只聽後樓的她，嘆着氣說：「唉！我又受他騙了」，直到午夜，我一覺醒來，還能領聆她的哭聲，怨聲，這是多麽的傷心事啊！</p>
<p>今天中午，她還沒有起來，二房東娘娘，盡着人道，敲開了門，勸她起來，只聽得她告訴着說：「他（指王先生）有一個外遇，住在××路××里，他倆常常跳無作樂，可是他自己沒有錢，平時家裏的開支，都是我的私蓄，還要常常來騙錢去化，遇到我要對付他們的時候，總是用溫言巧語來哄騙我，昨天早上，又向我拿了一筆錢去，他說是去買東西來送禮謀事情的，到此還沒有回來，唉·我也不用說了，我就佩服他們男子的騙術高罷！」</p>

<h3>蘇聯影片在日本之遭遇</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>日人第一次看到蘇聯的電影是在一九二六年，該片名「戰鬥艦波登金」。但是並不曾公映，只是在横濱試演一次。其後「風」「三百萬元事件」，「母親」，均相繼輪入。我們知道，高爾基原著的「母親」，在日本是沒有開映之可能的。繼此輸入者爲「熊之結婚」「死塔」「公　之姬」「女性之勝利」「農奴之翼」等片這些片子，一般的都禁止開映。</p>
<p>這中間曾有過一時間的中斷。其後又有「亞洲之嵐」，「春」「全線」，「大地」，「北進之蘇維埃」，「生存鬭爭」，「握有攝影機的他」，「五忻計劃」，「舶來爾」等。</p>
<p>以上各片，均得公開演映，對於日本觀衆，確是引起强烈之興趣。尤其是「五年計劃」，更使日人對蘇聯能有深刻之了解。</p>
<p>這時候有一値得我們特别舉出的，便是「新女性線」。這是蘇聯的文化影片，誠爲貴重之作品，可是不幸不能開映。</p>
<p>其後爲有聲電影時期。如尼古拉愛充導演的「人生指導」，在電影理論與電影技術方面，都駕凌於美國電影之上。有聲影片還有「頓河之靜」，「一人」，「二會合」，「撒德文加」等。</p>
<p>可惜的是一般的都不能全部公開很少有能窺全豹的，關於宗敎方面的如「大地」「中華紀之死」，「他父親之煩悶的一段」，社社罪惡方面的如「大地」中富農毒殺公共農塲之耕牛，羣衆行動的，音樂如International等，都是絕對禁止。這對日本觀衆，或許是引爲不幸的吧。</p>

<h3>德國聲片的前途</h3>
<p>— 現代</p>
<p>│爭向中國市塲傾銷│</p>
<p>電影事業在中國，向來是把握在美國人鍍金影片的手裏，那種誘惑的肉感，鑋鬆的，滑稽，放蕩的做作的美國影片，最能夠投合中國人的嗜好，所以，十五年來的影界，老是讓美國稱覇，但，近年來萬事不願後人的德國，在掙扎苦鬥中漸漸抬頭而注意着東方市塲，要與美國爭覇，是不容掩飾的事實，過去的烏發公司，就是一個强有力的覬覦者。</p>
<p>在今日，烏發公司的全部作品，完全給萬國影片公司取得了映權，於是聲勢更雄壯，預備在全中國大幹一下·因爲德國的作風，壓根兒與美片不同，那種眞實性的描畫，偉大的胆魄與靈活的鏡頭，在國人的印象留下不可泯滅的痕跡，萬國影片公司肯幹，敢幹，就在這一點上。第一部作品已到上海，名字呌「龍翔鳳舞」。</p>
<p>但是，德國片商的雄心，並不是「祇此而止」，跟着產生的就有一家德意志影片公司·它們的計劃是整個兒的介紹│把全德影業的上流出品都搬到上海來。同時因爲上海感受着「一二八」夜的大威脅，在各個人們的心中都浮起槍殺砲轟的慘象，這「上海之戰」給予上海人以非常的敎訓。所以，它們第一部運來的聲片，是「西線活地獄」，而畫面上所描畫的，都是些頽圮摧毀的民屋，砲彈轟炸的戰地抵抗到底的健兒；差不多是把過去「閘北之戰」，重演映在衆面前，這不得不佩服它們的聰明·同時它們還有有聲映機，和美機爭競。</p>
<p>總結一句話，德美影片的鬥爭已開始了。但是我國從事電影業的　們，這以後的責任，是比較的更重了，專讓外人來我們中國，喧賓奪主，猶如國家失了治外法權，一任他外來的侵略，到何日爲止呢？</p>
<p>「西線地獄」是德意志影片公司出品，是針對美片「西線無戰事」的一部戰事鉅著。</p>

<h3>國產影片作風之沿革以及今後之趨勢</h3>
<p>— 吉仲</p>
<p>很一雲眼似的國產電影，有史以來，也已經有十餘個年頭了，雖然這一個時期，並不算長，可是在它的歷程中，的確也有了幾度的變化，現在約略的記它出來，同時還加上一種預測，也就是今後的趨勢。</p>
<p>在最初所謂國產影片，徉簡直是一味胡閙，糟得不堪現狀，當然也談不到什麽藝術，社會上也不加以切實的注意，當作爲賣野人頭的把戱，自明星出品孤兒救祖　記一時轟動，就替國產電影界殺出了一條血路，影片公司也就此相繼成立，那時的作風，大都注重於社會的描寫，盡量的揭出重重黑幕，所以稱作爲社會影片。天一大中國的從事於裨史片的攝製，簡接就造成了古裝影片的勃興，風聲所播，似乎是非古不可，所以那時候是第一個轉變時期，從社會的作風，變作爲古裝的作風。</p>
<p>華劇友聯二公司眼見到古裝片的已成强弩之末，另闢門路，他們就從事於武俠片的創製，「白芙蓉」「山東　馬」的得人歡迎，善於仿模的國產電影界，也彼此的互相改轅易轍，所以這是第二個轉變時期，由古裝而易爲武俠。</p>
<p>盛極必衡，風行一時的武俠片，又告淘太了，明星公司神怪片「火燒紅蓮寺」開映後，在營業方面，竟得到了意外的成功，於是國產片大有非「火燒」不可之槪，這是第三個轉變時期，從武俠而易爲神怪。</p>
<p>首都電檢會的雷厲風行，神怪片就此奄奄一息，正巧舶來聲片盛行，國產電影也就羣趨於有聲片的製造，這是第四個轉變時期，從神怪而易爲有聲。</p>
<p>現在的國產電影，還在有聲潮中過度，可是最近也有些衰落的現象了，無形中又將漸趨於野𧟏風俗，征獵獸片的一條路上去，更前途的變化，還是誰也不敢加以預料呢。</p>

<h3>嘉寳幼年的寫實</h3>
<p>— 鶴譯</p>
<p>地方是在瑞典的首都，斯託克霍姆。</p>
<p>在公寓後面的一個小的庭院裏，一個女孩在玩，她對玩偶談話，當牠小孩一般地和她玩笑。她走前走後，她的二手動着，她的姿態變着，溫柔的聲音，忽而嬌呼，忽而歡笑。她有豐富的情感，做作着，常常地做作着。</p>
<p>這庭院和在斯託克霍姆城一切别的庭院並沒有什麽分别。一方綠的草地有幾處顯出灰色的泥土陽光散佈了牠的愉快和温暖，眞是一塊幽蔭的小場合，尤其在厦天微凉的傍晚。</p>
<p>但這玩洋囡囡的女孩使那個庭院更其顯着了。她就是我們的葛雷泰，格斯泰夫蓀。</p>
<p>光陰愉快而安逸地過去，這女孩漸漸地長成了。她已抛掉她的洋囡囡，而代以學校裏的書本了。但她的愛做作仍和從前一樣，也許更利害呢。</p>
<p>這小的庭院依舊是她的遊戲塲；依舊是她幻夢，野心，和希望的中心。而且現在已變做一個舞台了，因爲在這裡，她時常聚集了許多小孩子，來做演劇的遊戲。她指導他們怎樣動作，告訴他們做些什麽，她總是帶着一個愉快的笑臉熱忱，東跳西跑的指導着。</p>
<p>「你做母親，」她吩咐：「你做父親，你做小弟弟·········」</p>
<p>於是在一羣孩童丨和比他們大一些的人們丨的當中，種種的遊戲表現出來了，充滿了孩童的幻想，和孩童的愛做作，但其中有一個意圖在統制着全體。</p>
<p>時候又一年一年地過去了，在一個夏天的晚上，這女孩坐在她家附近的一所露天戲院裡，看着男伶和女伶表演他們所扮的角色，她非但快樂，並且覺得有異樣的興味。這裡她内心中的個性流露了。</p>
<p>再數年後，她的朋友們知道她在做電影演員，但他們並不驚異，這本來是在他們意料中的事。他們談到小時候飯後或傍晚在那小庭院的情形，都深深理會地點着頭。</p>
<p>再後來，葛雷泰在電影界的聲望，忽然增大，她離開了斯託克霍姆城，離開了這小的庭院，公園和蔭道，但她將無限的光榮，時時輪送到她的帮鄕來。在黑暗的戲院裡，小時候和她一起遊玩的人們，看她表演人生的戲劇；她兒童時的朋友都讚美她，並且說葛雷泰的出名，他們是不會驚異的。</p>
<p>她幼時的幻想實現了，</p>
<p>我和她的哥哥同坐在一個斯託克霍姆有名的大飯店裡的洋台上咖啡室裡面，在我們右面一條小溪的對岸，矗立着一座皇家的城堡，我們坐在牠淸幽的陰影裡，一直過去，至許多排列着的尖屋頂當中，看見了生長嘉寳的故城，瑞典皇子和他的朋友坐在咖啡室的角裡，大約隔我們有三張桌子的距離。（未完）</p>
<h3>所見如此</h3>
<p>— 胡哲明</p>
<p>假使中國人個個不看舶來影片的話，我想中國每年外溢的金錢，至少可以減少幾百萬元。（但是何止此數）</p>
<p>假使將看舶來影片的金錢，捐助東北義勇軍的話，我想，至少可以多殺幾千個的敵人。</p>
<p>假使我們貴同胞，能像日本專吸日本香烟一樣，專看國產片，那末，我國的影片製造公司全體，每年至少可以有幾百萬元的額外收入。假使每年多有幾百萬元的金錢，來培植植幼稚的國產片，我想，國產片總有與舶來片爭榮的一日。</p>
<p>假使我們貴國的製片商，能用同業　忌自相殘殺的精神，同心協力地來同舶來片競爭，我想，國片總有打倒舶來片的一日因爲我們觀影的同胞，决至不會沒有國家觀念的。</p>
<p>我希望專看舶來片的貴同胞，卽使現在的國產片不値你的一顧的話，請你也要稍有國家觀念，少看看舶來片，爲國家留些元氣，雖然是藝術無國界，但是現在國難當頭，爲娛樂而致金錢外溢，究竟於心不忍吧？</p>
<p>希望電影刋物的主編者，對於國產片要努力的宣傳，用公正的態度來批評和指導，切勿專爲舶來影片作義務宣傳員。（却酬）</p>

<h3>眼睛是靈魂的窓戶</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>人身上各種器官之中表情，最有力的就是一雙眼睛。眼睛的筋肉直透進大腦中間去，把心理的活動與身體的活動聯合起來。這些筋肉有一種精神的勢力爲别種器官所沒有的眼，臉，頭三部是人身上表現情緒的最主要的部分。沒有這三部，我們就談不到表演的藝術如果一個演員把他的眼睛閉攏或竟把頭部完全包藏起來，他的身體上不論那一部分不論怎樣美妙的動，他心裏的情緒斷不能夠表現出來。</p>
<p>譬如舞以或是演說台上忽然有一個人站到台中心來，大衆的眼必定都望着他的臉丨由他的臉集中到他的眼睛。大衆所最注意的就時這個人的眼睛。</p>
<p>兩個人初次會面。你對我的眼睛看，我也對你的眼睛看。兩個人往後是相愛呢或是相仇呢？這個問題就在這四目相對的時候决定了一大部分。兩隻好鬥的動物，譬如狗與貓，也是如此。甚麽力量都沒有比較之前，兩方最先比較的就是目力。這是我們日常的觀察所得到的知識。</p>
<p>甚麽緣故呢？因爲人都相信對方的心意是可以由他的眼睛裏探出來因爲人人都相信，眼睛是靈魂的窓戶，由瞳人裏面可以尋到一個人靈魂的深處。</p>

        <h1>1932.11.14</h1>
<h3>An Overview of Food Imports Amidst Rural Decline</h3>
<p>The current rural decline is due to a complex set of reasons, such as the failure of silk and tea exports, while the rural consumption of industrial products has not decreased, resulting in money flowing to the cities. Rural finance is in dire straits, and agricultural products cannot be sold urgently, leading to a sharp drop in prices. Furthermore, the disappearance of merchants' wealth has reduced the demand for agricultural products, while abundant autumn harvests have increased supply. These are all reasons for the current low prices of agricultural products and the rural panic. However, the most important reason is the dumping of foreign agricultural products in China.</p>
<p>Taking food as an example, the import quantities of the three main items—rice, wheat, and flour—in the three years since 1929 are as follows (unit: dan):</p>
<p>Year 18 of the Republic    Year 19 of the Republic    Year 20 of the Republic</p>
<p>Rice         108,228,05            198,911,03            107,408,10</p>
<p>Wheat        5,663,846             2,762,240             22,773,424</p>
<p>Flour        11,935,296            5,188,174             4,889,275</p>
<p>Observing the above figures, it is known that food imports were the highest last year. The unique abundance of food imports last year was partly because the price of grain was high due to the poor harvests of the spring and summer of 1930 following the famine of 1929, and grain merchants made huge profits. The general public thought that hoarding grain could lead to wealth, and excessive futures orders were placed. Secondly, the unprecedented floods in the Yangtze River last autumn led the general public to believe that there would be a shortage of food after the disaster, and they did not hesitate to order in large quantities. However, in reality, the rice harvest in the Yangtze River basin and southeastern provinces was very abundant, and the wheat harvest in the north was also excellent. Although there was a major flood last year, the damage to crops was very limited. The rice harvest in Sichuan Province in 1930 was only 40% due to severe drought, but last year it had returned to normal. Hubei, due to the high elevation of its rice paddies, had a very abundant harvest. The disaster area in Hunan was only the northeastern part of the province, and the rice production in the unaffected area was still sufficient to supply the entire province. The rice production in the southern counties of Henan was also very abundant. Therefore, the idea that there would be a shortage of food after the disaster was superficial.</p>
<p>Last year, wheat imports reached a record high of 22.7 million dan. In 1929, the wheat-producing areas of the Northwest suffered an unprecedented drought, yet wheat and flour imports in 1929 and 1930 were far less than last year. There is no doubt that this was a chaotic and abnormal situation. Of these 22.7 million dan of wheat, only 1.5 million dan were borrowed by the government, so merchants imported 21.2 million dan on their own. This is because domestic statistics lack information and there is no investigation into the surplus or deficiency of products. After the flood, the government and the public were concerned about food for the people. The government had already borrowed wheat, and the people blindly followed suit by buying wheat. Moreover, the import of foreign wheat mostly used the exchange as a tool. Flour mills also often sell futures flour on the exchange at the same time. General speculators are ignorant of the world situation and do not understand the causes of the world panic and the stage it has reached. Upon seeing the price of flour and wheat fall, they compete to buy it, resulting in losses for themselves and harm for society.</p>
<p>The import of food is still in full swing this year. According to customs records, the quantities are as follows (unit: dan):</p>
<p>Rice         Grain         Wheat         Flour</p>
<p>January       1,733,113        1,338,099         605,088</p>
<p>February      1,396,458         901,479          919,639</p>
<p>March         2,448,255         2,175,715         1,009,812</p>
<p>April         2,873,380         2,728,599         867,391</p>
<p>May           2,994,069         1,765,052         912,125</p>
<p>June          2,008,653         1,654,779         427,681</p>
<p>July          1,903,214         841,358          256,184</p>
<p>August        1,675,602         249,996          292,851</p>
<p>September     1,265,036         198,026          280,289</p>
<p>Total        18,297,780        11,853,103        5,571,060</p>
<p>Observing the above figures, the quantity of rice and grain imports in the nine months has far exceeded the total for the entire year of last year.</p>
<p>This shows the enthusiasm of merchants for purchasing foreign rice after the flood last autumn. The past bans on rice exports from various provinces and the current rice taxes all contribute to the good sales of foreign rice, while domestic rice production is stagnant, resulting in losses. In addition, although wheat imports are only half of the total for last year, they far exceed those of previous years. Flour has already exceeded the total import volume of last year. Of the wheat and flour, the government borrowed 2.1 million dan of each this year, accounting for a very small portion of the total. It can be seen that the dumping of foreign grain in China has a greater impact on the current rural economy than government borrowing.</p>
<p>We can now clearly understand that the current rural decline is actually the intrusion of the waves of the world panic. The world powers that dominate the world have all built tariff barriers that are impossible to climb. It is only natural and inevitable that they must use colonies and semi-colonies as outlets for their surplus products. China, with its backward economy and disorganized structure, has lost its economic defense. The country's economic policies and the people's commercial knowledge are so immature that it is not allowed by the situation to not be exploited by neighboring countries. If we want to build a tariff barrier, the contradiction of the environment does not allow the emergence of an effective tariff barrier under a sound diplomatic policy and fiscal tariff policy. If we want to talk about planned economy, is it not a daydream and a vain fantasy? If we want to find a way out for the nation in the trivial rural work, we only see it as futile.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chongqing telegram: The Yu army is advancing on Fushun, and the battle is very fierce near the city.

<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain source, the method to solve the Sichuan situation was discussed by Dai Jitao, Zhang Ji, and Song Ziwen in Wuhan with Chiang Kai-shek.

Liu Xiang recently went to the front line to command the battle, and Luzhou and Fushun are especially contested.

They used sulfur bombs to burn houses inside and outside the city, killing and wounding innocent civilians. The cries shook the sky, and refugees were everywhere. Almost all the shops and houses in the big and small river streets were destroyed. The Yu army's Fan, Pan, and Guo troops also attacked Fushun and Niuyaodu, and they were scheduled to launch a general attack on Neijiang and Zizhou on the 11th. Liu Xiang was bent on causing a continuous war. What crime did Wenhui commit? What did the people of Sichuan do to deserve this? Yielding cannot calm his anger, and retreat does not allow him to survive. He was forced to defend himself. This was against his original intention and contrary to his original intention. How should he stop the arrogance and end the disaster of war? Please make a judgment and issue an order to obey. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Dramatic Changes in US Attitude Towards Russia</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Will Recognize Soviet Russia After Assuming Office</p>
<p>According to a Berlin dispatch from the National News Agency on the 11th, Washington sources report that there will be dramatic changes in the US attitude towards Russia. The Roosevelt administration will recognize Soviet Russia after assuming office. The likely appointment of Senator Ston as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, succeeding Boleh, makes this move even more likely, as Ston and Roosevelt share the same views on the issue.</p>
<h3>President Hoover Expresses Attitude Towards War Debts</h3>
<p>British and French Notes to Be Published Today</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 12th, President Hoover, on his way from California to Washington, told people that if we want to continue the work of restoring prosperity and overcome the many difficulties we face, we must have continued unity and constructive efforts across the entire economic front. Before I leave office, I will work for unity, and even after I leave office, I will continue to cooperate with the opposing party on various sound plans to restore prosperity. Roosevelt caught a cold during the last few days of the election campaign and has not yet recovered.</p>
<p>▲ According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 13th, the British and French government documents regarding war debts have already been sent to the US government separately. It is heard today that Italy and Belgium will also send similar documents. However, the Foreign Ministry stated today that France has not adopted a collective action with other countries on the debt issue. It is rumored that the content of the British document to the US has been notified to the major European governments, but this claim has not been verified.</p>
<p>▲ According to a National News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 12th, the US State Department received information today that Poland is preparing a note requesting the US to reduce the total amount of debt and allow for the postponement of the repayment of the installment due next month. In addition, it is heard that Italy and Czechoslovakia will also join the effort to reorganize war debts. The British document has already been sent to President-elect Roosevelt. Roosevelt caught a cold yesterday and stayed in bed. It is heard that he has recovered today and will study the document.</p>
<p>▲ According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 12th, due to rampant speculation about the content of the British and French war debt documents, the US State Department has decided to publish the original text in the capitals of Britain, France, and the United States on the morning of November 14th.</p>
<p>▲ According to a National News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 12th, it is claimed today that the British and French war debt documents requested a postponement of payment pending the World Economic Conference. Although this news has not been verified, it has triggered protests from Senator Bola, and other prominent figures have also inquired about how the US government will deal with the situation if the economic conference is related to war debts in any way. President Hoover had previously strongly opposed discussing war debts at any economic conference, while Bola opposed the postponement, believing that it is beyond doubt that Britain and other European countries are unable to repay the installment due on December 15th. However, it is questionable whether a solution based on postponement is appropriate. He issued a statement today urging various countries to change their policies as a necessary condition for postponing repayment. If the current policies remain unchanged, they will destroy world civilization, because if Britain pays at this time, it cannot but harm the world economic organization, and even if it pays later, it may not but have an even greater impact. Therefore, this postponement, if it cannot obtain a guarantee that payment can be made later and that previous policies will be changed, is in name a postponement but in reality an elimination. Bola also severely criticized European countries for spending huge sums on armaments, stating that he does not doubt the financial situation described by Britain, but believes that there are fundamental errors in European policies. He repeatedly cited that Britain originally owed approximately $1.2 million USD, which has been reduced to $700,000,000. Furthermore, according to Senator Bingham, there will be a strong Republican group in the Senate opposing war debts, which will become an elimination of concessions. He said that he does not see any hope that the next Congress will consider eliminating war debts, because the Democratic Party platform opposes eliminating war debts, and he also believes that debtor countries, if they can reduce waste, have sufficient financial resources to repay their debts. However, the Democrats' opposition to elimination does not mean that they do not support reductions and deferred payments.</p>
<h3>Simon Arrives in Paris</h3>
<p>According to a Havas dispatch from Paris on the 13th, British Foreign Secretary Simon arrived in Paris at 5:35 PM and left for Geneva in the evening.</p>
<h3>US Discovers Vote Buying</h3>
<p>Each Vote Costs Only One Dollar</p>
<p>According to a National News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 12th, just as the US public is about to forget the election campaign after the election, news that the House Elections Expenses Committee is investigating evidence of vote buying has caused a stir across the country. According to the committee, which was elected by the previous Congress specifically to supervise, it has obtained a large amount of evidence of vote buying in Pennsylvania and Delaware, with each vote costing one dollar. A certain organization that ostensibly does not reveal its partisan affiliation is buying votes, and it is suspected that the Republican Party is behind it. It is heard that this case was brought forward by Wilson, the chairman of the Independent Committee of the Philadelphia Lowe movement.</p>
<h3>Washington Hunger Marchers to Stage Major Petition</h3>
<p>According to a National News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 12th, the Washington Tribune reports that thousands of hunger marchers are currently organizing a petition team to march to Kyoto, intending to petition when Congress is in session. The administrative committee of the Columbia District considers this matter to be serious and is planning to declare martial law in Kyoto. It is anticipated that the petition team will include veterans who were driven out of Kyoto by the military this summer. Therefore, the Columbia administrative committee plans to immediately convene the National Security Forces of the district to cooperate with the police in preventing and controlling the situation.</p>
<h3>Further Reports on the Cuban Hurricane</h3>
<p>The Town of Santa Cruz Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Camaguey on the 12th, the town of Santa Cruz has been destroyed by a tsunami and is no longer suitable for human habitation, making it difficult to rebuild. The exact number of deaths is impossible to ascertain because the corpses have been swept away by the tide. More than 800 bodies have already been buried. To prevent the corpses from endangering the health of the living, the remaining corpses will be cremated. Today, smoke can be seen rising from the crematorium. This tragic work has now begun. Officials estimate that 1,700 people have died. Two British islands, 150 miles from Jamaica, have also been affected by the hurricane, with more than 60 people killed and hundreds injured. Government offices have been completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Britain Advocates Complete Abolition of Air Force</h3>
<p>Long-Range Guns and Large Battleships Also to Be Abolished</p>
<p>To Prevent Civilians from Suffering Collateral Damage</p>
<p>According to a National News Agency dispatch from London on the 12th, it is heard that the British Foreign Secretary's speech in Geneva explaining Britain's new disarmament plan will focus on the complete elimination of large-scale aerial warfare. It is said that the new plan will include the abolition of all existing air forces and military aviation equipment by all countries, and will advise all countries to sign a treaty strictly prohibiting the conversion of civilian aircraft for military use in wartime. In addition, it also advocates abolishing long-range guns and large battleships to prevent civilians from suffering collateral damage. It is also heard that when British Foreign Secretary Simon accompanied Czech Foreign Minister Benes to meet with British Prime Minister MacDonald last Saturday, Benes agreed to persuade Germany to rejoin the disarmament conference.</p>
<p>▲ According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 13th, there was important activity behind the scenes yesterday regarding the issues of war debts and disarmament. Prime Minister MacDonald was residing at Chequers, and Foreign Secretary Simon accompanied Dr. Benes of the Disarmament Conference to visit him. It is believed that the three members discussed the British disarmament proposal that Simon will submit to the Disarmament Conference. It is heard that it includes the abolition of aerial bombardment, international regulations on civil aviation, the destruction of the most powerful warships, the limitation of cruisers to a maximum of 7,000 tons, and the reduction of submarine types and numbers. The newspapers today all expect that the United States will allow the British and French to propose an extension of the war debt moratorium, but any proposal to reduce the amount of war debts must be attached to the large-scale European arms expenditure.</p>
<p>▲ According to a Havas dispatch from Paris on the 12th, the cabinet meeting has completed the review of the French construction plan for armaments and security, and will submit it to the State Council for a final decision next Monday.</p>
<p>▲ According to a Havas dispatch from London on the 12th, when the House of Commons discussed the disarmament issue, Foreign Secretary Simon only explained the principles that the British delegation intends to advocate in Geneva. As for Privy Councilor Baldwin, he strongly argued for the danger of aerial bombardment to civilians. A certain member of the Labour Party also spoke on the matter, saying, "If the general public believes that soldiers fight intentionally, then they should be responsible for the war, and they should suffer the consequences of the war." The implication is that military expenditure should be effectively reduced, which is obvious. But no matter what, Britain's proposal on the disarmament issue will not be disclosed outside Geneva. Whether the moderate cabinet members will be succumbed to the cabinet members in charge of national defense and aviation manufacturing and aviation transportation companies during the cabinet discussions can only be first known by the Disarmament Conference General Committee. Although it is possible in the future to replace the navy with aircraft to take on national defense responsibilities and maintain imperial communication, it cannot be denied that the navy is still a vital component of British national defense at present. With the resumption of the Disarmament Conference debate imminent, the reason why London is still keeping the secret on the air force reduction plan is truly the most interesting question at present. In addition, there is one more point that must be noted, that is, the expression of this kind of silence happened at the time of the departure of Davis, the US disarmament representative, from Britain. It can be seen that although no compromise was reached on the content of the problem when Davis was in Britain, there must have been an agreement on the attitude to be taken by the two countries in common. Moreover, Davis continued to claim that if the issue of equality and percentage is raised among the naval countries, it is equivalent to setting a grade, which will hurt the face of each country, and the naval issue will be impossible to resolve. Therefore, Davis volunteered to travel between Rome and Paris to make France and Italy agree to the ratio stipulated in the London Treaty and not to re-mention the dispute between France and Italy on military equality. From this, it can be inferred that what Davis discussed with Italian Mussolini was purely a technical basis and did not involve political issues. The United Kingdom and the United States believe that if the dispute between France and Italy can be resolved, the construction of light warships can be stopped, and both the United Kingdom and the United States will benefit greatly. The main point of the problem now lies entirely in the construction problem of cruisers and torpedo boat destroyers. This is what we can assert. We also dare to assert that Davis's efforts in this matter have reasons that are even greater than this, because the US's share of cruisers tonnages given to Japan by the London Treaty is a decision the United States is unwilling to concede, and the US naval authorities fear that Japan's request to amend this layer will inevitably lead to the breakdown of the Disarmament Conference. As a result, the United Kingdom and the United States are striving to reduce the tonnage of light warships so that Japan will have no way to demand an increase in the tonnage of this fleet. From this, it can be seen that the reason why the United States is involved in the Mediterranean issue is on the Pacific. This is extremely interesting. The United Kingdom also wants to reduce the tonnage of light single ships, so it advocates that the complete abolition of submarines is necessary. Because if submarines are abolished, the fast ships used to deal with submarines on the sea surface can also be reduced. The United States may agree on this point, but Japan may not agree. As for the issue of armored ships, Washington wants to limit the total tonnage in order to retain heavy-tonnage battleships. The United Kingdom is happy to say that they are classified and restricted. It is said that the opinions of the United Kingdom and the United States are close to each other. It can be seen that they have worked hard. US naval experts seem to have requested to retain the main ships of 35,000 tons. As for the armament on the main ships, one party advocated the 12-inch caliber gun position, and the other party advocated the 16-inch caliber. The United States seems to be able to concede and agree to set the large guns on each main ship at ten with a 12-inch caliber. In addition, it is planned to reduce the maximum tonnage stipulated in the Washington Treaty by one-third, but this reduction is only to stop the construction of ships in the plan for the United States, while Japan should abolish the existing battleships that have been incorporated into the navy. It is now planned to suggest to Japan that only the armament should be removed from these battleships, and the hull should not be dismantled so that it can still be used when war occurs, but it should not be listed in the battleship replacement order. It is not allowed to be supplemented internally. It is not certain whether Japan will admit this point. As for the issue of torpedo boat destroyers, the United States insists on maintaining a certain tonnage and cannot reduce it any further. As for aircraft carriers, the United States believes that in view of the current needs of the United Kingdom and the United States, the tonnage should be set at 22,000 tons. All these points should be the basis for discussion when the disarmament issue is discussed in Geneva in the future.</p>
<h3>Japan's Cunning Policy</h3>
<p>So-Called Compromise Plan As Such</p>
<p>According to a Dentsu dispatch from Tokyo on the 13th, it is not difficult to predict how the League of Nations Council to be held on the 21st will deal with the biggest problem of the Manchurian problem, and the Japanese government's countermeasures, as advocated by Foreign Minister Uchida, are that the Japanese government will resolutely, directly, and clearly describe the inevitability of Manchuria's independence in front of the countries regarding Manchuria, and that this political effect of recognition will be highly touted. This will be used as a basic effort to promote the League of Nations' understanding of Manchuria. As for the so-called compromise plan claimed by the League of Nations, the Japanese government seems to avoid actively suggesting the plan, but the Japanese representative Yue will imply in the debate what kind of plan can be promised by Japan. However, the maximum compromise plan that Japan can obtain seems to be that the League of Nations will suspend the conclusion of the report for a certain period of time, at least about a year, and place a so-called period of watching Manchuria. Therefore, it is not difficult to predict the opinions of the Foreign Ministry here.</p>
<p>▲ According to a Japan United News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 13th, the League of Nations authorities recently made an important proposal on resolving the Sino-Japanese issue, which was sent to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The government plans to discuss this matter carefully with the relevant agencies. The Japanese side has decided on two major principles for solving the central issue, the content of which is as follows: 1. Japan generally acknowledges the spirit of the relationship between China and Japan before September 18 and the particularity of Japan in Manchuria in the Lytton Report, but severely prohibits going back to the facts of the past and discussing the issue of responsibility between China and Japan. 2. The stability of China is necessary for the peace of the Far East and the world. Therefore, in order to improve the future Sino-Japanese issue, the League of Nations will discuss effective measures based on this principle at the League of Nations General Assembly, and Japan will conduct discussions at the League of Nations General Assembly based on this principle.</p>
<h3>International Committee Air</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th, Dentsu News Agency: Recently, there have been widespread rumors in China that the foreign envoys stationed in China have proposed the establishment of an international committee to assist in resolving the Sino-Japanese negotiations on the Manchurian issue, or that the Lytton Commission would participate in direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. Upon receiving this information, Japanese diplomatic authorities expressed the following views: The actions of the League of Nations are still unclear, yet the Chinese envoy group has formally put forward such a concrete proposal, which is highly suspicious. If this is true, then this proposal must have been based on the achievements of the four-nation envoys' mediation of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire negotiations after the Shanghai Incident. However, the nature of the Shanghai Incident is completely different from the Manchurian Incident. The Shanghai Incident could accept the persuasion of foreign countries, while the Manchurian issue has always maintained the principle of rejecting the participation of third countries. Even if the Lytton Commission participates in the Sino-Japanese negotiations, it will absolutely not be recognized. Because today, when Manchukuo has become independent and Japan has officially recognized it, anything that conflicts with the existing facts of Manchukuo will be consistently opposed. If a wait-and-see attitude is adopted regarding whether the future development of Manchuria is beneficial to peace in the Far East, then even the establishment of a committee will not be opposed. However, if the establishment of this committee is planned and advocated with the intention of suppressing Japan, it will be resolutely rejected.</p>
<h3>Japan's Indecisive Policy Towards Russia</h3>
<p>The Newly Appointed Ambassador to Russia is About to Take Office</p>
<p>Negotiations for a Non-Aggression Treaty are Difficult to Start</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th, Dentsu News Agency: The newly appointed Ambassador to Russia, Yoshiji Ota, will depart from Tsuruga around the 10th to take office. Therefore, Foreign Minister Uchida has frequently summoned former Ambassador Hirota, new Ambassador Ota, Ambassador Matsushima, and Vice Minister Arita to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in recent days for important consultations. However, the content is highly confidential. Since representative Yosuke Matsuoka's visit to the Russian capital, the Russian side has repeatedly urged Chargé d'Affaires Amau to conclude a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty. In view of this fact, the Japanese side has decided that determining Japan's attitude first is a primary condition for the Russian proposal. However, regarding the non-aggression treaty, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs avoids making responsible statements, and unnecessary discussions seem to be gaining momentum. Because of the Manchurian issue, Japan is in a difficult international situation. Cautious commentators argue that such a major case does not need to be decided hastily, and the atmosphere within the ministry seems to be dominated by this view.</p>

<p>Paris, 13th, Guomin News Agency: Since the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, Yosuke Matsuoka, arrived in Paris, more than a hundred journalists from various countries have visited him. Their purpose was to explore Japan's position when the League of Nations discusses the Lytton Report. As a result of the interviews, Matsuoka gave each reporter a prepared statement, reiterating the reasons for Japan's military actions in Manchuria. Regarding the Lytton Report, he only stated that some parts were agreed upon by Japan, while the rest were difficult to agree with, and that he would explain the errors Japan believed to exist at the League of Nations. Matsuoka was very cautious in answering the reporters' oral inquiries, only making every effort to publicize the chaotic situation in the Far East, and much of what he said was absurd. Here are a few examples to illustrate the propaganda of the Japanese representative in Europe. For example, Matsuoka told a reporter: "We should know the Far East situation more clearly than the people of the West." He also said that the naval and land forces of the major European and American powers have been in China for 32 years, sometimes used to protect their own interests and their expatriates, and sometimes even used to protect their own officials. The interests of the European and American countries in China are relatively small, so they regard the Chinese situation as accidental and not very important. Japan, however, cannot regard accidental events as very important. He also said that the total number of expatriates in China from European and American countries is far less than that of Japanese expatriates. The situation in China has reached a breaking point, and the September 18th Incident only promoted an action, and the deep-rooted chaos created by some old warlords in China over the years is the background of this action. China's enemy is its own people, not foreigners, etc., doing everything possible to slander in order to cover up their brutal aggression. We must urgently seek ways to deal with it. In addition, Matsuoka reiterated Japan's commitment to peace and upholding the Open Door Policy, and promoted the puppet organization.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, 13th, Guomin News Agency: The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung published today an interview with Mr. Matsuoka, the Japanese representative to Geneva, by its reporter. According to Matsuoka's words to the reporter of the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, Matsuoka's visit to Moscow was only of a personal nature and had no political significance. However, he admitted that he had taken this opportunity to exchange irresponsible opinions with the Soviet authorities in order to promote friendship between Japan and Russia and eliminate various misunderstandings. Mr. Matsuoka further stated that the current Japanese people's understanding of the Soviet Union has improved considerably, and the Soviet Union has gradually expressed understanding of Japan's claims. Therefore, Mr. Matsuoka felt that the goods purchased by the Soviet Union from Japan would gradually increase, such as various Japanese manufactured products and machines, which would be sufficient for the Soviet Union to exploit its resources. Mr. Matsuoka also mentioned the recent Japanese-Russian oil agreement and the service of Japanese engineers on the Siberian railways. Matsuoka expressed disbelief in the panic of various countries that the Soviet Union would seize the world's market from various countries, etc. He said that the Soviet Union now has a population of 160 million, and its current urgent task is to supply the needs of its own people, so the era of competition with the outside world is still too early. When discussing the Manchurian issue, Mr. Matsuoka did his best to defend the recent treaty signed between Japan and the Manchurian puppet state, but he neither denied nor admitted that Japan would provide a huge loan to the puppet state. Mr. Matsuoka only stated that the trade situation in the puppet state was excellent, and that the puppet state's army currently has about 100,000 people, all trained by Japanese officers. Mr. Matsuoka finally stated that the League of Nations is not a suitable organization to judge whether a country should be recognized by another country. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung commented on the above-mentioned remarks of Mr. Matsuoka, saying that Mr. Matsuoka's remarks were too polite. In fact, Matsuoka had in-depth discussions with Litvinov, Karakhan, Radek, etc. in Moscow on the Manchurian issue, and Karakhan may soon visit Japan in person to thank Mr. Matsuoka for his visit, and the conclusion of a new Japanese-Russian treaty may begin to be discussed in the near future.</p>
<h3>Strange Phenomenon in Geneva</h3>
<p>Troops Defect and Sing the Internationale</p>
<p>Geneva, 13th, Reuters News Agency: Geneva is quiet in the middle of the night. The troops have withdrawn to their camps, and the demonstrators have not come out due to the rain. There are now 10,000 soldiers in Geneva, that is, one soldier for every fifteen residents. Yesterday, most of the crowd, except for a few violent ones, behaved in an orderly manner. The demonstrators outside the barracks were mostly teenagers and students, and there were no angry scenes except for scolding and singing the Internationale. The troops do not seem to pay much attention to the situation here.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 12th, Reuters News Agency: The situation is slightly calmer after the riots on Wednesday, but a dangerous situation is brewing in this peaceful city. Due to the tense situation, the Swiss government today continued to transfer two more battalions of troops to the city to defend against the chaotic army. When the troops arrived, the residents of Geneva cursed them. The commander then ordered the use of leather belts to draw water and splash the crowd. The crowd clamored and some wanted to seize the belts. When they heard the soldiers loading bayonets, they did not dare to act. The police used batons to disperse the crowd, and the crowd retreated. Today, a team of troops stationed in Geneva showed friendship to the demonstrators, so the team has been kept under guard in the exhibition hall. However, the soldiers broke the lower glass windows and sang the Internationale, chatting and laughing with the crowd outside the window. The trade union announced a general strike for one day in memory of those who died in the riots on Wednesday. However, the day passed peacefully and no riots occurred. The authorities attach great importance to this situation and have adopted various precautions to maintain order. The demonstrators who died on Wednesday were buried at different times and in different cemeteries in order to prevent the gathering of too many people from becoming uncontrollable. The commander has now issued a statement, effectively placing Geneva in a state of siege. Today, there were socialist demonstrations elsewhere in Switzerland, but there were no major disturbances. When a communist party member who died in the chaos on Wednesday was buried, there was a riot, but it was not serious. The body was wrapped in a red flag and placed in a coffin without a lid. When the funeral procession reached the exhibition hall, the soldiers of the 7th team of Geneva mixed with the demonstrators. The authorities then put the team in stone pipes. At the same time, tram transportation was blocked by demonstrators. The tram company now plans to suspend all operations. Isaac, a member of the Geneva City Council, actively participated in the demonstrations on Wednesday and has been arrested.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 12th, Havas News Agency: People are marching everywhere in the streets and alleys here, often numbering between 400 and 3,000, and gunshots are heard from time to time. Some residents are very frightened. A communist party member was killed in an accident yesterday and his funeral was held today. A part of the 7th battalion of soldiers smashed windows along the way and expressed sympathy to the demonstrators who were singing the International Revolutionary Song. Then they marched through the city and cut the ropes of the electric poles on the trams. The commander of the Geneva defense army has transferred the Vaud canton troops originally stationed between Lausanne and Geneva to Geneva. These troops arrived in the city at 7:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Will Germany Dissolve the Parliament Again?</h3>
<p>The Senate Warns the Government</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Havas News Agency: The German government believes that the newly elected House of Representatives has still failed to clarify the political situation, resulting in continued chaos and no recovery of the national economy. It is heard that the new House of Representatives will be dissolved again within the next week, and elections will not be held in accordance with the current election law. If this is true, then the German government will openly implement a national dictatorship. The government has not yet denied the news of the dissolution of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, 12th, Havas News Agency: Since the news of the government's dissolution of the House of Representatives spread, the representatives of the states in the Federal Senate were greatly moved. This afternoon, the various committees of the Senate held a meeting and decided to issue a firm warning to the Federal Government, urging it not to take actions that violate the Constitution. The representatives of the states may also pay a visit to President Hindenburg as a result.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, 12th, Havas News Agency: After the Prussian officials who belonged to the Socialist Party and the Republican Party were ordered to resign by the administrative commissioner appointed by the central government, Prussian Premier Braun protested to President Hindenburg. Hindenburg replied that according to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Leipzig, the administrative commissioner has the right to dismiss Prussian officials.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, 12th, Havas News Agency: Mr. Schnee, the German member of the League of Nations Investigation Team, recently reported the investigation situation of the team to President Hindenburg.</p>
<h3>Indian Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be Held in the British House of Commons on Thursday</p>
<p>Gandhi to Fast to Liberate the Untouchables</p>
<p>London, 13th, Reuters News Agency: The nine Indian representatives to the third session of the Indian Round Table Conference arrived here this afternoon. According to the current schedule, the first meeting is scheduled to be held in the House of Lords on Thursday, at which time the Indian representatives will be formally welcomed and all preparations will be made. From November 21st, daily meetings will be held to consider the various issues listed on the agenda.</p>
<p>▲ Bombay, 12th, Havas News Agency: Gandhi has decided to fast to fight for the untouchables issue, and this decision will be implemented as scheduled and will not be postponed. Gandhi declared that the Indian orthodox faction has no right to exclude 40 million people from society. Gandhi also said that Indians have oppressed the untouchables in the name of religion for hundreds of years. World public opinion should uphold justice to seek the liberation of these ethnic groups. As for the Indian orthodox faction, based on the judgment of the Bombay High Court, they do not allow untouchables to go to temples to pray. However, the British judge declared that the purpose of the court's judgment was purely to prevent disturbances from occurring in front of the temples.</p>
<p>▲ Madras, 12th, Havas News Agency: The British government has levied a punitive tax on the places in India where revolutionary storms have occurred, causing the local people to move away to avoid this tax, especially near Calicut. The residents of these places seem to have unanimously requested the government to implement the Poona Pact by order (note that this agreement was the agreement between the Indians and the untouchables that caused Gandhi to stop fasting) and to abolish the treatment suffered by the untouchable class. However, the British government believes that this issue is related to Indian customs and habits, so it is unwilling to intervene and has rejected the residents' request. Gandhi's followers are dissatisfied with the British government, saying that its policy is aimed at destroying the Indian people's faith in Gandhi. As for the orthodox faction in India, they are concentrating their forces to confront Gandhi. If Gandhi fasts, they will also fast in response. Therefore, the current situation is quite ridiculous, as both sides are retaliating with the same means. The trend of suicide is increasing, and the British government may issue an order to prohibit it. Gandhi's followers plan to lead the untouchables to lie on the ground in front of the temples and fast together, while the orthodox faction gathers in front of the prison where Gandhi lives and threatens to fast in response.</p>
<p>▲ Poona, 12th, Guomin News Agency: Today, Gandhi met with a reporter from the Associated Press in prison and said that if the Guruvayur temple is not opened to allow the untouchables to worship, he will fast again on New Year's Day next year. Gandhi is still thin and haggard at this time, and his physical strength has not fully recovered.</p>
<h3>Russian Adventurous Spirit</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th, Reuters News Agency: The members of the Soviet Northern Sea Exploration Team, who recently arrived in Yokohama on an icebreaker, are scheduled to depart for Vladivostok on the 18th of this month. The icebreaker, named the Sibiryakov, was damaged by ice floes in the Bering Strait and needs to be repaired in Yokohama for eight days. It is reported that the voyage recently took the "Northeast Passage" from Arkhangelsk to the Far East, which is an unprecedented feat in navigation. The crew consists of 65 people, including one woman.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japan Discovers a Conspiracy Group</h3>
<p>The Independent Youth Society Has Great Influence</p>
<p>Takayama Hidesan Has Close Ties</p>
<p>Smuggling Weapons to Disrupt Our Northeast</p>
<p>The crisis of right-wing movements in Japan is probably greater than the crisis of left-wing movements in fact, because right-wing movements use the name of defeating left-wing movements. In fact, it is not only pulling Japan backwards, but also breaking the status quo and even fundamentally overthrowing parliamentary politics. This is a very obvious fact, but because they have active-duty soldiers behind them, and active-duty soldiers have local veterans' associations behind them, no one dares to ask about it in militaristic Japan. Therefore, Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated in broad daylight at the official residence as the current prime minister. Now, almost half a year has passed, and the general public only knows that Inukai was assassinated, but does not know the inside story of why the assassin assassinated Mr. Inukai.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the people who presided over the red looting movement were only three people, and the loss of property was also very limited. Although it caused great unease in Japanese society, the scope was still very small. The recent case that occurred was much bigger. The group that presided over this conspiracy was the "Independent Youth Society," which is not very well-known among right-wing groups. They wanted to assassinate the current Prime Minister Saito Makoto, Minister of the Imperial Household Makino Nobuaki, Minister of the Imperial Household Kido Koichi, and Vice Minister of the Imperial Household Sekiya Kazusaburo during this autumn's grand exercises. They carried pistols to the Kansai area, but were discovered by the police before they could carry out their plan. The process is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The central figure of the Independent Youth Society is Kodama Yoshio, 24 years old, who is the most capable fighter in the right-wing group. In 1928, he strongly opposed the establishment of the Labor-Farmer Party, submitted a Jianbai Shu directly to the Emperor, and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Okada Rihei is also a strong member of the Independent Youth Society. In 1926, he was particularly angry about the establishment of the American Exclusion Act, so he secretly ran into the American Embassy in Tokyo and tore down the American flag hanging on the roof of the embassy, and then ran away without being arrested. Although the Japanese police later found out, they did not investigate further.</p>
<p>The Independent Youth Society was organized by Kodama with dozens of young people. Its political program is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"1. Respect the Emperor and love the country as the principle of our actions."</p>
<p>"2. We must reform the capitalist politicians who expose their self-interest."</p>
<p>"3. Eliminate the red thoughts and actions that attempt to reform the national system and eliminate all non-Japanese and evil thoughts."</p>
<p>On the surface, it seems that there are no practical actions, and it is just a thought group that is opposed to a left-wing group, and it is an extremely naive and immature small organization. Especially in recent Tokyo and other major cities, such small organizations are like bamboo shoots after a rain, and there are countless numbers. However, because the authorities have given them shelter, they have become even more fierce. At first, they were only intimidating a few financial capitalists, and it did not seem to be a big danger to the current system. However, the assassination of Inukai was not unrelated to the right-wing groups. The Independent Youth Society that has now been broken up is deeply related to that case. At the same time, Takayama Mitsuru's son, Takayama Hidesan, a senior veteran of the Japanese ronin faction, also has close ties. Therefore, Takayama's residence was also inspected, and even the Tenko-kai was checked. In this way, all the right-wing groups in Japan will inevitably be involved.</p>
<p>This kind of conspiracy is by no means a sudden brewing in a short period of time, nor is it an accidental combination of injustice. Taking the trade managed by Oda Toichi, the owner of the Thirteen Goods Sales and Export Co., Ltd. in Kobe, as an example, since 1927, on the surface, he is a gramophone machine merchant. He uses legal procedures to import pistols from Germany, Hungary, and other countries to Japan. In five years, the number of imports has been 260,000 to 270,000, all of which have been disassembled and used as raw materials for gramophone machines. It is not easy for the customs personnel to detect, and of course it is even more difficult for the police to know. In addition, in collusion with foreign ships, before or after the ships entered the port, they were secretly picked up by small motorboats. In the past five years, the total number of secret transfers has been no less than 500,000. In Japan, a country with order and organization, it has to be said that this is an unprecedented and unheard-of strange thing. According to his own news and police speculation, the vast majority were exported to the three northeastern provinces. It is true that in recent years, Japanese warlords have wanted to make trouble in the Northeast, using poor order as an excuse to advance troops and conquer the Northeast. Therefore, from his right-wing private groups to the people who bear the main responsibility, they all participated in, or at least knew about, this secret trade, and regarded this trade as a major work of aggression. They made every effort to contact the green forest heroes between Bai Shan and Hei Shui to disrupt China's politics, and at the same time used this to support Japanese imperialism's political power in the Northeast. What he didn't expect was that the green forests in the three northeastern provinces turned around and refused to be his running dogs, and even went a step further to fight for national struggle. Even if it is not enough to defeat Japan's rule in the three northeastern provinces and cannot immediately restore the lost land, it can shake Japan's attempt to invade the Northeast and make the so-called "Manchurian puppet state" unstable. Then, his secret trafficking of arms (the pistol alone has 500,000) has already caused great chaos in the Northeast last year's September 18th Incident, and it is still continuing to cause trouble. Unexpectedly, this secret import (weapons) trade, after being sold to the three northeastern provinces, brought many back to Japan. He himself estimates that 230 were secretly transported to Tokyo, and at least 60 or 70 were transferred from the right-wing relationship to the hands of left-wing groups. However, this is only a part of the truth that has been discovered. I am afraid that after a considerable period of time, if the investigation continues, there will be more strange things exposed (Tokyo, November 8, 1932)</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Sends More Troops to Attack Luzhou</h3>
<p>Liu Commands the Attack Between Yongchuan and Rongchang</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui Is Stationed in Zizhong to Coordinate and All Parties Defend to the Death</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Liu Xiang previously sent Liao Haitao, Mu Yingzhou, He Chunwu and other four brigades, two airplanes, and two warships to launch a large-scale attack on Luzhou. Liu Wenhui's troops rose up to resist in order to maintain the resources, and the battles have been fierce and unprecedented for days. One side attacks and the other defends, with great sacrifices. On the 8th, one warship of the Chongqing army was destroyed by the Chengdu army, and one airplane was shot down. The Chongqing army retreated slightly. Upon hearing the news, Liu Xiang ordered two brigades, including Guo Xun, to join the front line. Together with the previous ones, there were a total of six teams, and the entire second team of airplanes was dispatched to bomb along the city. At the same time, they attacked fiercely with artillery. On the evening of the 10th, more than a dozen places in the city caught fire, and the city walls were almost breached. Fortunately, Liu Wenhui's reinforcements arrived and cooperated to defend to the death. By late at night, both sides still maintained their original front lines. On the 11th, the contact continued, and there was still no victory or defeat. Luzhou has always been known as a dangerous place. The Chengdu army has heavy troops stationed at Guanyizui, Dahejie, and along the river, as well as at Zhongshan Shangguanshi, Xiaoguanmen, and Chenjiaba outside the city, and has built strong fortifications. It is very difficult for the Chongqing army to attack upwards. However, it is rumored that Lantianba and Wufengling have been occupied by the Chongqing army. Whether this is reliable remains to be verified. In addition to sending a large army to attack Luzhou, Liu Xiang also has heavy troops attacking Neijiang and Fushun. In Fushun, the two divisions of Pan Wenhua and Tang Shizun are fighting fiercely with Zhang's brigade and the Qingxiang army in the Huangjiachang, Daijia Temple, and Huaidezhen area, but there has been no progress. In Neijiang, there are Wang Zanxu's division and Li Luo's troops. Wang's division has been holding on to Paimu Town with the Chengdu army for four days. Li Luo has not joined any side. The Chongqing side is vigorously advocating the meeting of Li Luo in Zinei, but this is just to boost morale. Currently, both Liu's attention is focused on Luzhou, Fushun, and Neijiang. Liu Xiang is traveling back and forth between Yongchuan and Rongchang, commanding the various departments to advance. Liu Wenhui is coordinating all parties in Zizhong, strictly ordering them to defend to the death, and never give up Luzhou. Deng Tian, Yang, Li Luo, etc. are currently setting up new defense lines and are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the war between the two Liu's. It is estimated that once the victory or defeat is determined, they will issue new proposals. (October 12)</p>

<h3>Xu and He's Remnant Bandits Flee into Shaanxi in Three Routes</h3>
<p>The Eighth Division, One Brigade of the National Army is Tasked with Pursuing and Intercepting</p>
<p>Chiang Orders the Complete Elimination of Remnant Bandits in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Within the Month</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Xiangqian and He Long's remnant bandits, having previously joined forces and roamed through Hubei and then Henan, have now split into three routes and fled into Shaanxi Province. According to a telegram from Yang Hucheng, the bandits still possess a force of over 10,000 well-equipped men, entrenched around the Baizengchu area. The National Army's pursuing and intercepting forces have been increased to eight divisions and one brigade, including the divisions of Hu Zongnan, Xiao Zhichu, Liu Maoen, Jiang Fusheng, Li Mo'an, Li Sizhuo, Liu Chunlin, Fan Shisheng, and others, which are deployed in various locations for pursuit. The two units of Liu Maoen and Xiao Zhichu's pursuing forces have deeply pursued into Shaanxi and are currently stationed in Xujiahe, coordinating with other armies for a joint剿suppression. Mr. He Chengjun previously received an order from Chairman Chiang to be stationed in Laohekou and personally command the operations. On the 12th, He returned to Hankou by plane from Laohekou to meet with Chiang, report on the bandit situation, and request instructions. It is heard that he will soon return to the front to supervise the剿suppression. Chiang believes that there are no longer large groups of Red bandits within the borders of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, but small groups remain hidden and difficult to eliminate completely. On the 12th, he specifically telegraphed orders to all armies, requiring them to completely eliminate the remaining bandits within the month and permanently prevent future troubles. The order is recorded below: "It has been found that although the major bandits entrenched in various places in the three provinces have been successively defeated, the remaining elements have not been completely eliminated, and small groups remain hidden and cause trouble from time to time. You must continue to work hard and thoroughly search and suppress them, and you must completely eliminate them within this month to permanently prevent future troubles. You should also cooperate with local military and political leaders to strengthen the people's self-defense organizations and promote transportation construction. Areas such as Shangcheng, Guangshan, Xinji, Yingshan, Huang'an, Daye, Yangxin, Yanxia, Mianyang, Qianjiang, and Honghu have been ravaged for a long time and should be given extra attention. It is now reported that various circles in Nanjing and Shanghai are organizing an inspection team for the bandit areas, which is expected to go to the bandit areas at the end of this month or the beginning of next month for on-site inspection. At that time, you must treat them with courtesy and provide them with full convenience. You should also pay attention to and expedite the supervision and repair of local roads and all tidiness and cleanliness matters in advance. In addition to separate telegrams to the governments of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces and the administrative offices of various bandit areas, and instructing the county magistrates to pay attention together with the resident military officers, all of the above matters must be strictly complied with and forwarded to all subordinate troop officers to comply with, in order to eliminate the bandits, quickly heal the wounds, and achieve real results, and to show the people of the country through the on-site report of the inspection team."

<h3>Soviet Russia Plans to Dump Kerosene in Our Country</h3>
<p>Branch Offices Established in Qingdao, Large Oil Refineries to be Built</p>
<p>Head Office in Shanghai, Branch Offices in Major Cities</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Soviet Russian kerosene has long suffered from overproduction. Although a contract to sell 200,000 tons has recently been signed with Japan, it still cannot alleviate the problem of excessive stockpiling. According to foreign sources, Soviet Russia is now planning to increase its income from the second Five-Year Plan by selling large quantities of kerosene to our country. The proposed method is to establish a head office in Shanghai and branch offices in Guangzhou, Hankou, Beiping, Jinan, Yantai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. The Russian Lobinstain of the Gonghe Tai foreign firm on Hubei Road in Qingdao has been entrusted as the manager of the Qingdao branch. The general manager of the Shanghai head office is scheduled to come to Qingdao around the 20th of this month to discuss everything with Lobinstain. In the future, it is planned to find a large site in Qingdao to build a large-scale oil refinery and establish oil towers near the码头docks to facilitate the import of raw materials for refining and analyzing kerosene, automobile oil, machine oil, and other types of oil for sale. If this matter is realized, other kerosene companies will be significantly affected, and the impact on our country's kerosene production will be particularly significant and cannot be ignored. According to recent investigations, kerosene imports in Qingdao account for the third-largest share of imported goods, with a total annual import value of over 4.05 million taels of customs silver.</p>

<p>Automobile Industry Dispute, Petition to the Province. Thirty-two small automobile companies in this county have petitioned the province for relief and submitted separate petitions to the county government, the Construction Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation of the Xiqia Cheng long-distance automobile company's arbitrary collection of vehicle licenses and forced closures. After receiving the petition, the Construction Bureau issued a reply yesterday stating that if the allegations are true, it would be an intentional infringement of the rights of others and a disruption of road administration. The small automobile companies, facing the interruption of their livelihoods and the dispatch of police by the Jiangyin County Public Security Bureau to arrest people, pushed their representatives, Shi Dehao, Qian Meichun, Zheng Xiamin, and Shi Qinglin, to petition the provincial ministries, the provincial government, the Construction Department, and the Civil Affairs Department, requesting prompt relief to maintain the people's livelihood.</p>

Chen, of the Criminal Court of the same court, opened a trial, and Cao Wenzhi, Pan's wife's younger brother, appeared in court to admit to adultery with Gen Ti, but Gen Ti denied his statement, causing the case to change. Chen opened a trial yesterday and sentenced Pan Qiefang and his wife, Pan Cao, not guilty. The plaintiff, Wu Yang, has already filed an appeal.</p>

<p>Half of the Rent is Allowed to be Retained for County Use. Due to the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, troops gathered in this county and spent a lot of money on defensive works, plus entertainment and other expenses, totaling more than 160,000 yuan. In addition to using local public funds and various reserves, 60,000 yuan was borrowed from various banks. After the end of the military affairs, the provincial government denied it because the county government had not reported it in advance, resulting in the failure to return the huge amount of money. Public funds can be delayed, but commercial loans cannot be delayed. The provincial government collected two months' worth of house rent, and the local authorities petitioned the provincial government to retain all the rent as military money, but were repeatedly rejected by the provincial government. Later, local gentry and representatives of various groups sent Xu Juntan to petition the provincial government and sent Wang, the director of the Finance Bureau, to the province to present the difficult situation. The Finance Department finally agreed to allow half of the unremitted house rent to be retained for county use, and half still needs to be remitted to the province for urgent needs. Yesterday, it was learned that the Finance Department had forwarded the report to the provincial government, which had also approved it. The county has been notified yesterday.</p>

<h3>Circumstances Along the Way</h3>
<p>At the starting point, a grand and impressive sight. At 7:50 AM, a line was formed at the intersection of Carter Road. After roll call, Zhang Xinfu fired a shot from his signal gun, and hundreds of swift feet took off together, heading straight for Jing'an Temple. The long, snaking line then divided into front and rear sections. Passing Jing'an Temple, which was one mile away, Zhang Zaojiu led the pack, followed by Ge Jinwen, Zhang Zhihe, Chen Liwen, Lü Chongyi, Yao Yaxin, Lü Wenxia, and others. It was still too early to tell who would ultimately come out on top.</p>
<p>▲ Xu Aichen Initially Takes the Lead, then Zhang Zhihe Surpasses Zhang Zaojiu to Take First Place. Lü Wenxia, Xu Aichen, Ge Jinwen, and Zhang Zaojiu were neck and neck, almost reaching Zhaofeng Garden. Xu Aichen then overtook Zhang Zhihe, taking the lead by a distance of thirty yards, exhibiting a superior form and great potential for victory. Thus, he had smooth sailing until a change occurred on the Avenue Petain.</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Hongqiao Road: Guangfeng Garden was at the two-and-a-half-mile mark. Turning from Route Pelliot and entering Hongqiao Road marked six miles, half of the entire race. No significant changes occurred within these three miles. Ge Jinwen and Lü Wenxia lagged slightly behind, placing Zaojiu in third. At the Lincoln Road intersection, Zaojiu overtook Zhang Zhihe again, securing second place. Xu Aichen, however, consistently maintained the lead. Guiding the way into Hongqiao Road, Zhang Zhihe fell back to fifth. At that time, the order of the leaders was: (1) Xu Aichen, (2) Zhang Zaojiu, (3) Lü Wenxia, (4) Ge Jinwen, (5) Zhang Zhihe. It seemed that the individual and team championships were largely decided, as Zhang, Lü, and Ge were all top athletes from the Shanghai West District.</p>
<p>▲ Changes on Avenue Petain: As the racers advanced, passing the Tong De Girls' School and Jiaotong University, and then turning north onto Avenue Haig and heading southwest again on Avenue Petain, the championship situation underwent sudden changes. These last three miles saw two major shifts. Ge Jinwen picked up the pace, step by step, overtaking Lü Wenxia and Zhang Zaojiu, and then surpassing Xu Aichen to take the lead. His back-and-forth competition with Xu, with repeated overtaking and falling behind, was arguably the most exciting moment of the entire race. Ge did not relax, staying close behind Xu. As they approached Avenue Albert, Ge once again overtook Xu, taking the lead. Then, Wang Zhaoxiang overtook Zhang Zaojiu, and Zhang Zhihe moved forward.</p>
<p>▲ Competition Approaching the Finish Line: On Route Pichon, heading straight east, the China Athletic Field was already in sight. Ge Jinwen, having overtaken Xu Aichen, now held first place. Lü Wenxia, with increasing momentum, surpassed one after another, challenging Ge Jinwen shoulder-to-shoulder. As expected, Lü flew past Ge, reaching the finish line thirty yards ahead. Xu Aichen finished third, one hundred yards behind Ge. Wang Zhaoxiang, Zhang Zaojiu, Zhang Zhihe, and others followed in close succession.</p>

<h3>A Groundbreaking Achievement for Women</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the realization of the first-ever women's race walking event. Following the men's thirteen-mile race, the women's one-mile race began at eleven o'clock. After roll call, they lined up, and the starting gun was fired. They circled the field four times. However, due to a lack of training, some participants had poor form, and some were running and jumping, leading to Liu Wenjing, despite finishing first, being disqualified for three violations.</p>
<p>▲ No Change in the First Half: From the start, Liu Wenjing sped ahead, demonstrating great speed, raising suspicions of her being paced. This caused her to slow down slightly. Nevertheless, Liu remained in the lead, with Cheng Xianshi close behind. The order of the first three laps saw no changes. The order was: Liu Wenjing, Cheng Xianshi, Zhang Peilun, Huang Zhenqi, Zhang Baojin, Wu Shiying, Ye Ming, Guo Lianni, and others, with distances of two to three feet separating them.</p>
<p>▲ A Pity for Being Disqualified: Upon reaching the finish line, Liu Wenjing and Cheng Xianshi were neck and neck, with Liu Wenjing finishing a mere two inches ahead, followed by Cheng Xianshi. Zhang Baojin surged to third place. However, the referee's decision was that Liu had received three warnings for violations and could not be excused for the first offense, thus had to strictly enforce the rules, disqualifying her and elevating Cheng Xianshi to first place. It was a pity for Liu. Hopefully, she will make another effort next time. The groundbreaking nature of the women's event drew considerable attention from the spectators. The awards were presented by Shen Siliang, and the event concluded.</p>

<h3>"Race Walking Training Method" to be Published Soon</h3>
<p>Written by Lu Xiangqian 丨 Foreword by Shi Youhui</p>
<p>丨Pictured Demonstrations by Shi Jinsheng, Zhang Zaochi, and Zhou Yuyu</p>
<p>Race walking competition has become popular in China. The Diligent Bookstore at 392 Route Labor神父, Shanghai, has recently commissioned Mr. Lu Xiangqian, chairman of the Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation, to write "Race Walking Training Method," which details the history, definition, attire, and methods of race walking, as well as basic training, training schedules, competition strategies, race walking rules, and world records for men's and women's race walking. It also includes a brief history of the China Race Walking Team, biographical sketches of race walking athletes, and the regulations of the Shanghai International Race Walking Association. In addition to text, it contains over forty valuable photographs of race walking athletes such as Shi Jinsheng, Zhou Yuyu, and Zhang Zaochi demonstrating correct form. Mr. Shi Youhui, coach of the China Race Walking Team, has written a foreword for the book, highly praising it. The book is priced at six jiao (with a 10% discount). Mail order registration is one jiao and one fen. It is expected to be published on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Second Interport Football Trial Match</p>
<h3>Mixed Team Comes Out on Top</h3>
<p>Scored Both Penalties</p>
<p>Wins 3-2 Against the White Team</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Western Football Association held its second interport trial match at the Recreation Ground. Twenty-two top Chinese and Western players from Shanghai were divided into a White team and a Mixed team for a competitive match. Several selection committee members attended to observe and critique, aiming to evaluate talent for potential inclusion in the team and to prevent overlooking promising players. The crowd was smaller than the previous match, and the game was less intense. Unexpectedly, the White team, expected to represent Shanghai, conceded two penalties and ultimately lost 2-3 to the Mixed team, contrary to the selection committee's expectations. Commentators suggested that the referee's excessively critical handling of the two penalties contributed to the White team's defeat. However, the day's performance showed that the Mixed team's forwards were more impressive, especially the right wingers, Kezhi and Chen Jiaqiu, who demonstrated excellent coordination. The White team's defense, on the other hand, appeared stronger.</p>
<h3>丨Contributions from Formal Candidates丨</h3>
<p>After two trial matches, the general public likely has a good understanding of the formal candidates. However, Chinese and Western viewpoints differ, with the former prioritizing agility and the latter emphasizing strength. Based on observations, here is a suggestion for a potential team for the selection committee to consider:</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Li Ning, He Lei, Mai Sai'er</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Zha Xu, Lao Deng</p>
<p>Stoke, Weisihe, Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Ke Zhi</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan is undoubtedly a capable goalkeeper. David Guren lacks experience and should be a backup. There is a shortage of interior midfielders in Shanghai, and Li Ning, Feng Yunyou, Stoke, and Mai Sai'er are among the best. Li and Feng performed excellently in the first trial match, while Li and Stoke stood out yesterday. Li is certain to secure a central position. The challenge lies in choosing one of Stoke and Feng, so they are listed together for future consideration. Zha Xu is experienced and strong, like Mount Tai. He Lei and Weisihe are versatile and can play on either side. Xu Yahui is fierce and agile, and Zha Xu feels a sense of rivalry with him. Lao Deng is a natural center forward. The interior wing positions deserve consideration. Mai Sai'er, who played as an interior defender yesterday, was formerly a forward and is agile and skillful. He would be better suited for the left interior position than Jack. Chen Jiaqiu controls the ball with ease, providing excellent support on either side. His coordination with Kezhi yesterday was outstanding. He is recommended for the left wing. Chen Zhenhe is unmatched as the right winger. Fa Fange is slow and his shots are inaccurate, unlike Kezhi, who excels at both running and shooting. Based on these observations, here is a proposed lineup.</p>
<h3>丨Review of Yesterday's Intense Battle丨</h3>
<p>The first half began with the White team playing with ten players, facing pressure from the opposing team. A cross from Kezhi landed in front of the goal, but Gaoshanfu misjudged and shot into the sky. Chen Jiaqiu passed again, but Zhou Xianyan blocked it. Fifteen minutes into the game, White team's Ya'erjie entered the field, boosting morale. Ya'erjie shot from within the crowd, scoring the first goal. The Mixed team maintained momentum and invaded again. De Fei committed a foul, resulting in a penalty. Chen Jiaqiu, entrusted with the team's hopes, shot like an arrow. Zhou touched the ball with both hands, deflecting it onto the goalpost and down. The referee declared it a goal. The first half ended with a score of 1-1.</p>
<p>▲In the second half, Kezhi from the Mixed team was injured and replaced by Baowuerdeng. At that time, the White team showed improvement. Chen Zhenhe and Lao Deng made several attacks, but David defended well. Suddenly, the situation changed. The three players on the left side of the Mixed team simultaneously approached the goal. Goalkeeper Gensheng missed an opportunity to shoot, and the enemy's reinforcements arrived, negating the effort. The Mixed team attacked again, and Gaoshanfu failed to block the shot, resulting in another goal. After losing the lead, the White team regained momentum. He Lei was blocked and passed the ball to Chen Zhenhe, who then passed it to Fa Fange. Fa Fange dribbled the ball and created an opportunity for Lao Deng to score, tying the game 2-2. Soon after, Tang Boni, carrying the ball, was tripped, resulting in another penalty for the White team. Chen Jiaqiu, with familiarity, scored again. As the sun set, the game ended, with the Mixed team winning 3-2.</p>

<h3>Soochow Volleyball Shines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Soochow University's volleyball team defeated Guanghua. Soochow University's volleyball team has twice been crowned champion of the East China Four Universities League, and its strength is second to none. Although some veterans have graduated and left the school this semester, the team's lineup has not diminished. This visit to Shanghai is for the purpose of observing and learning techniques. Yesterday, the 13th, they arrived in Shanghai and played against Guanghua on Da'xi Road, resulting in scores of 21-10, 21-13, and 21-19, all won by Soochow. Yesterday's match was very exciting.

<p>The Chinese Children's Education Society's Annual Meeting Concludes</p>
<h3>丨Election of Directors丨 Next Annual Meeting Scheduled for Beijing or Jinan</h3>
<p>The third annual meeting of the Chinese Children's Education Society lasted for three days, with the 13th being the last day. According to the annual meeting agenda, the second day was for discussing proposals, and today was for discussing society affairs. A total of 36 proposals were on the agenda, excluding impromptu motions. Yesterday, only five proposals related to health education in the first category and one proposal related to curriculum, teaching materials, and textbook research in the second category were discussed. Including impromptu motions, there were still over 30 proposals remaining (including proposals for discussing society affairs). Today, according to the agenda, there was a visit to the Central Meteorological Observatory and the History Museum at 1:00 PM, and a reception hosted by the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau at Wuzhou Park and a banquet hosted by the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM. Therefore, the meeting in the morning needed to proceed at a particularly fast pace. Fortunately, a Health Education Committee had been formed yesterday regarding health education, and a Textbook Research Committee had been formed regarding curriculum, teaching materials, and textbook research. All proposals of the same nature or those that did not require excessive research could be grouped together and submitted to the committees for review and research, thereby providing a solution.</p>
<h3>Details of Proposal Discussions</h3>
<p>The meeting began at approximately 9:00 AM, with Tian Shuren as the master of ceremonies and Li Qingsong as the chairman. It was reported that the discussion of society affairs would be advanced. Proposals for society affairs could be divided into four categories: (1) the location of the next annual meeting, (2) the central issue for the next annual meeting, (3) issues related to improving the daily affairs of the society, and (4) issues related to adding new ventures. Regarding the first category, there were two proposals: (1) the next annual meeting should be held in Beijing and Jinan, and (2) the location of the society's annual meeting should be selected in an area farther from the society's central location in order to promote interest in children's education. (These were discussed together.) The chairman also reported that a telegram had been received from Fuzhou, stating that the climate was suitable and the scenery was beautiful, which was submitted for reference. As a result of the discussion, the first location for the next meeting was Beijing, and the second location was Jinan (if Beijing was not possible, it would be changed to Jinan). Regarding the second category, the central issues were: (1) the society should focus on civic training in the next year, and the fourth annual meeting should discuss and exhibit civic training cases. Heike Tan explained the reasons for the proposal. Zheng Xiaocang said that while civic training was the focus, special attention should be paid to history, and there were many areas of history that needed to be improved. Ma Jingxuan said that attention should be paid to national salvation education, expressing the national spirit and enabling society to understand thoroughly, and advocated for modifying the wording of the proposal. Xue Tianhan asked whether the research center issue was consistent with the exhibition center. The chairman reported that it was consistent. Luo Tingguang believed that civic training covered a wide range of content and did not need to be revised. Jiang Xicen and Shi Shifu argued that the research center of the previous session should not necessarily be the exhibition center of the next session, because after research, results would be obtained before determining the exhibition center, which would be better. Jiang advocated using textbooks as the center, and Shi advocated using the national language as the center. Ma Kehan said that in order to make the outside world understand the meaning of children's education, he still advocated using civic training as the center. Huang Jianzhong agreed with using civic training as the center and added that attention should be paid to six aspects of civic knowledge: (1) enabling children to understand national culture, (2) civic morality, (3) social organization, (4) national politics, (5) national law, and (6) national economy. He also said that the distribution and coordination of civic education materials in schools at all levels should be noted, and materials suitable for our national culture should be determined by referring to foreign situations. Ren Jian and Chen Jianqi proposed using production education as the center and said that production education was the most important goal of civic education. Wu Yanren said that the current first problem was the word "center," and no more details should be discussed other than the center. Xue Tianhan reported that the knowledge portion of civic training determined this time had been extracted and included in a separate subject area, which was smaller. Luo Tingguang said that only those related to children's education should be discussed, and the rest could be ignored. The chairman summarized the opinions, and the so-called central issues were (1) civic training, (2) textbooks (bird and animal languages attached), and (3) production education. Wu Yanren said that there was no need to call it a central issue, call it the points to pay attention to in the first, second, and third categories. Xia Zhanchu summarized and suggested that from this year to the opening of next year's meeting, research should be conducted on issues such as civic training, textbooks, and production education, and the next exhibition should focus on civic training. Wu Yanren said that the meaning of civic training was too narrow and should be changed to civic education. Chen Heqin advocated exhibiting all three. Dong Mengjian advocated still using the center because it was a research center, not a discussion center. (Discussion Result)</p>
<p>Maintaining the central issue as civic training (38 voted for production education, 31 for textbooks, and 21 for civic training). Following Xia Zhanchu's suggestion, three approaches were taken, and following Chen Heqin's opinion, attention was paid to all three exhibitions simultaneously. The third category, issues related to improving the daily affairs of the society: (1) how to increase the efficiency of the society (proposed measures: (1) an annual program of action should be formulated and followed, (2) there must be a certain amount of income and expenditure budget, (3) children's education should be published on a regular basis, (4) the society should have a member communication book dedicated to society information and educational news, which should be distributed to members every week to facilitate contact between members, and (5) work should be done in a spirit of division of labor and cooperation), (2) please add a special topic discussion column in the Children's Magazine, (3) compile children's education volume by volume for easy reading and broad promotion, (4) please open an international children's education news column in the Children's Education Magazine.

<p>Nanjing, 13th: At 3 PM on the 13th, the Municipal Social Bureau of Nanjing hosted a tea party for members of the Children's Education Association at Wuzhou Park, presided over by Wang Chongzhi. In the evening, the Central Government hosted a banquet for the members at the Huarui Reception Hall, with Ju Zheng delivering a welcome speech. During the banquet, Chen Guofu spoke at length about the necessary directions for improving primary school education: 1. Health education should be linked to children's families, and it is easier to achieve results by educating their mothers. 2. Primary school subjects are too numerous, and children's physical and mental states are too fragile to bear the burden. Schools should only teach essential knowledge that can be applied flexibly, such as focusing on nationalism in teaching materials when the country is in distress. Other subjects, such as stories and party knowledge, can be taught by families. 3. The content of existing children's literature is poor, cultivating a deep impression in children of seeking personal gain and forgetting that they are individuals of the nation. He hopes to correct this and make full use of examples of inherent culture in Chinese history to compile fairy tales, cultivating children to become children of the Chinese nation. Shao Yuan Chong spoke about how primary school education should adapt to children's individual personalities and guide them accordingly, focusing on the basic education of national character and correcting individual shortcomings. Finally, Zheng Xiaocang, a representative of the members, delivered a reply. The event concluded happily around 8 PM.</p>

<p>Slight Fluctuations in the Gold Market Last Week</p>
<p>丨 British and American Exchange Rates Initially Increased, Then Decreased 丨</p>
<p>The standard gold price fluctuated slightly last week, starting weak and then sharp, but then seemed to decline, but without excessive turbulence. The daily difference was at most six or seven taels. It happened to be the Western merchant autumn races, and the market only traded for two full days, and the psychology of the industry was hesitant and uncertain, so the supply and demand were divergent. Initially, the silver market reported an increase, and Shanghai's exchange bills were loose and abundant, so it was expected to decline. The opening price of 744 taels and 7 qian only decreased by 2 qian. Then, due to the dumping by the Guangdong merchants, it broke down by 40 taels. The next day, a low price of 734 taels and 3 qian suddenly appeared. Afterwards, it slightly fluctuated because the news of the US election was that Roosevelt was elected. According to Roosevelt's advocacy of raising silver prices, people's hearts turned downward to prevent the rise in silver prices. The gold price once went downstream, but the exchange market was calm, both overt and covert. Moreover, the Central Bank released spot goods, so the price was able to hold steady. On Thursday, unexpectedly, the silver price was reported to have fallen, while the exchange bills were still tight. The industry sought to close out short positions, and general short sellers rushed to cover, causing the price to soar, and Meng Jin suddenly exceeded the 750 taels mark. The autumn races were over, and full-day trading resumed. However, by the evening market, due to the tendency of Guangdong merchants to sell, the price fell. As a result, it soared by 12 taels and 9 qian compared to the previous day. The day before, it rose and fell, and the changes in the market were unexpected. The silver market was near falling and far flat, and people's hearts seemed to soften. Finally, 46 taels and 3 qian were seen. In an instant, the buyers were slightly more diligent, and the market was able to stabilize. The US dollar tended to be popular, and a sharp surge to a peak of 753 taels and 7 qian forced the silver market to deviate, and the British market shrank, and the American market was flat. However, private telegraphs and forward prices rose instead, especially the exchange rate soared, and the gold market fell due to the environment. It should have returned to the 50 taels level, but it was 44 taels and 1 qian in the end. The final easing trend resulted in 46 taels and 7 qian. However, after the close, due to the entry of scattered short positions, it rebounded to 48 taels and some change. The total comparison shows that the price rebounded by 1 tael and 8 qian compared to the previous Saturday. The high and low prices of the entire week differed by 19 taels and 4 qian (the difference between the opening and closing prices was 2 taels). As for spot goods, the Central Bank released and opened a total of about 1,000 bars of bare gold. Initially, 11 taels and a half were added, but later only 10 taels and 0.025 were counted. All the swap positions for November were initially more than 2 taels, but later only 7 qian and 5 fen were counted, and they have been mostly closed out. As for the overseas silver market, it has risen for three consecutive weeks and then slightly declined. The local exchange market has only shrunk by half a level for British gold (125), and the American gold is flat. The internal market initially increased and then decreased, and then tended to be flat, but it was also slightly different due to the exchange rate fluctuations. Among the Chinese gold businesses, the supply exceeded the demand. Currently, the US dollar is short about 2.3 million yuan. There are gold price hedges, and the pound sterling is short more than 200,000 pounds. As for the settlement price, it was initially pressed down to more than 70 taels, then later around 70 taels, and then around 60 taels. It is likely that the exchange rate continued to rise. This week, the overall increase and decrease was calculated as a 3-cent increase for British against US and a 1.9375-cent increase for American against British. Now, the high and low prices of the silver market and exchange bills are listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Compared to Last Saturday</p>
<p>Large Bars, Near Term Eighteen pence, four seven five Eighteen pence, one two Shrinking by zero six two five</p>
<p>Large Bars, Forward Term Eighteen pence, five Eighteen pence, one three five Shrinking by zero six two five</p>
<p>US Silver Price Two dimes, seven cents, three seven five Two dimes, seven cents No Change</p>
<p>Bombay Market Fifty-six rupees, zero nine Fifty-six rupees, zero six Shrinking by one anna</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate, Listed One shilling, nine pence, six two five One shilling, nine pence, three seven five Shrinking by one two five</p>
<p>US Exchange Rate, Listed Twenty-nine yuan, seven five Twenty-nine yuan, five No Change</p>
<p>Standard Gold Seven hundred fifty-three taels, seven qian Seven hundred thirty-four taels, three qian Rising by one tael, eight qian</p>
<h3>The Discount Market Is Becoming More Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday was a Sunday, a bank holiday, so the general atmosphere and trading conditions were generally flat and unremarkable. The silver discount rate did not fluctuate much. The early market was 7 qian, 0 li, 9 hao, 8 hu, and 7 si. The afternoon market was 7 qian, 0 li, 9 hao, 6 hu, and 2 si. As a result, the difference between the two markets was only 2 hao and a half. The silver discount rate was 3 fen in both markets, and it was similar to the previous day. The volume of exchange and bill transactions was 70,000 yuan in the early market and 20,000 yuan in banknotes. The volume of exchange and bill transactions was 170,000 yuan in the afternoon market and 50,000 yuan in banknotes. There were no transactions outside the market. The total volume of discount bill transactions in both markets was about 5 million yuan. Private banks received and delivered more than 24 million, and public banks received and delivered more than 6.7 million. Small private banks traded more than 200,000 yuan. The Jiangnan small silver dollar was 6 qian, 1 fen, and 6 li in both the early and afternoon markets. Only 3,000 jiao were traded in the early market. The Guangdong small silver dollar was 6 qian, 0 li, 2 hao, 7 si and a half in the early market, and 6 qian, 0 li, 3 hao, 2 si and a half in the afternoon market. 65,000 jiao were traded in the early market and 35,000 jiao were traded in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 4,000 wen to 409,000 wen.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>The Prosperity of the Bond Market Last Week</h3>
<p>丨Total Weekly Turnover Exceeded 50 Million Yuan丨</p>
<p>丨Prices Rose Significantly, with Large and Frequent Fluctuations丨</p>
<p>Over the past week (from November 7th to 12th), the spot market conditions of various bond maturities at the Chinese Securities Exchange showed little activity in spot trading. A total of 112,000 yuan was opened, including 33,000 yuan of 19 Customs, 14,000 yuan each of Financial 20 Customs, 12,000 yuan of Reorganization Heritage, and only a few thousand yuan of others. However, the futures market was quite lively, and the market sentiment remained very active. Major players were no longer as sluggish as before, and both near and far-term transactions were brisk. The market's prosperity was the best seen this year, mainly because bond prices fluctuated greatly last week, and the overall environment also experienced some changes. The daily turnover was highest on Thursday, reaching over 15.4 million yuan, followed by 9.74 million yuan on Wednesday and over 8 million yuan on Tuesday. The other days each recorded 5.6 to 6.2 million yuan. The total turnover for the week was 50.04 million yuan, including 33.12 million yuan for November maturities and 16.92 million yuan for December maturities, exceeding the previous week by 24.9 million yuan. Among them, Unified Salt Tax was the most active, with 7.67 million yuan for November maturities and 4 million yuan for December maturities. Unified Tax had 5.475 million yuan for November maturities and 3.13 million yuan for December maturities. Other notable figures include 4.215 million yuan for November maturities and 2.43 million yuan for December maturities of 20 Customs, 3.275 million yuan for November maturities and 2.02 million yuan for December maturities of 20 Rolled, 3.02 million yuan for November maturities and 2.4 million yuan for December maturities of Demobilization, 3.485 million yuan for November maturities and 1.315 million yuan for December maturities of 19 Customs, 2.68 million yuan for November maturities and 1.09 million yuan for December maturities of 19 Charity, 1.535 million yuan for November maturities and 490,000 yuan for December maturities of Customs Reorganization Heritage, 755,000 yuan for Customs, and 809,600 yuan for Reorganization 6 Li, with only 245,000 yuan traded for November maturities and 10,000 yuan for Financial. In general, the trend of bond prices in the past week, although the situation did not see major progress in the first half of the week, and diplomatic relations with Japan remained in an unresolvable state, the market, considering the peaceful resolution of the Shandong issue and the generally favorable situation, led to a good market sentiment, with investment buyers becoming increasingly active. The attitude of financial institutions also gradually improved, and major players were not as indifferent as before, resulting in a consistent surge in prices. Monday saw an increase of 60 to 70 cents to 1.30 to 1.40 yuan, Tuesday saw another increase of several cents to 1 yuan, and Wednesday saw an even stronger surge, with Reorganization 6 and Financial rising sharply by 3 yuan, Demobilization continuing to rise by 2 yuan, and others rising by 1 yuan to 1.60 to 1.70 yuan. However, the sharp rise in market prices was driven by temporary market sentiment rather than a genuine major development in the overall environment, leading to a strong reaction. On Thursday, the excessive price increases prompted those with goods to sell, and a certain party released a large amount, resulting in an oversupply and a sharp drop in prices of 1 to 2.30 to 2.40 yuan. On Friday, only Unified Salt Tax rose by about 1 yuan, with minor fluctuations in other areas. The weekend saw a consistent decline, but only by about 40 to 50 cents. By this point, the market situation was nearing its end. Although market trading remained active, it seemed to be dominated by swap transactions. Observing the trend, unless there are other major changes, there are unlikely to be major fluctuations in the near future. As a result, prices rose by 80 to 90 cents to 2 to 3 yuan compared to the previous week. The following table lists the weekly highs, lows, and fluctuations (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market Was Lifeless Last Week</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn has remained stagnant and weak for the past week due to sluggish actual demand and tight monetary conditions. The various trading groups have shown little vitality. In addition, yarn dumping in the Yangtze River region and the ongoing war in Sichuan have further impacted local yarn, leading to weak market sentiment and increased short selling. However, Rongxing, a major player, has been trying its best to resist. Nevertheless, the current situation is such that actual sales are too slow, and upward momentum is minimal. Fortunately, the bottom has dried up, and the mills have not accumulated excessive inventory. The market situation is lifeless, but sellers remain optimistic, believing that prices cannot fall. Therefore, new short sellers have eagerly entered the market. According to statistics, the total purchases by various trading groups throughout the week were only 2,962 bales. The market was sluggish, and the price of standard yarn fell by 2.3.4.6 cents compared to the previous week. The total turnover for the week was 136,600 bales. The following is a breakdown of the purchases by various trading groups:</p>
<p>Trading Group	Bale Amount	Trading Group	Bale Amount	Trading Group	Bale Amount	Same Trade	45</p>
<p>Luzhou	160	Wenzhou	5	Jiangxi	5	Sichuan	500</p>

<p>April Futures	146.9	144.9	145.1	Down 2</p>
<h3>Signs of a Turnaround in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>There are signs of a turnaround and upward movement in the cotton market. Although the situation for American cotton is unfavorable, the market has been fluctuating within a certain range this week. Therefore, some market participants are inclined to buy. In addition, prices in various production areas are also difficult to lower. As a result, those with actual goods are hedging, making it more difficult for the market to decline. As for the large amount of cotton that a certain manufacturer released, it is currently observing the prices in various regions and is unwilling to release more. Instead, it is considering covering its positions when prices fall. Therefore, if American cotton can stabilize, there are concerns that local cotton will not decline further. However, due to sluggish yarn sales and weak demand from mills, the future remains uncertain. Arrivals at the wharves include 3,539 bales of Yao cotton and 8,206 bales of Tong cotton. The current spot cotton business is good, and the prices of standard cotton for various months have risen by 5 to 6 cents compared to the previous week. The total turnover for the week was 465,500 dan. The following is a breakdown of the spot cotton purchased by various manufacturers:</p>
<p>Cotton Type	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Transaction Volume	Delivery Terms</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton	50.25	28.85	4,000 Bales	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<h3>American Cotton Down 15 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, a decrease in Southern hedging buyers, and a weak market. Futures prices fell by 15 to 18 points, and spot prices fell by 15 points. English cotton futures fell by 6 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 14 points. The Indian cotton market was stable, with Pingguo Er and Aomula rising by 2.25 and Robi Bailuo Creek rising by 3.375.

<h3>Silk and Tea Autumn Race Concurrence and Mid-Term Silk Market Report</h3>
<p>丨Early in the Week, Telegraphs Turned Silent, Silk Merchants Took Advantage of Low Prices to Purchase Raw Silk丨</p>
<p>丨At the Weekend, Japanese Silk Prices Soared, and the European and American Silk Markets Gradually Became Active丨</p>
<p>Last week, the local foreign silk market coincided with the mid-term of the Autumn Racing Season. In the first half of the week, all foreign firms were closed in the afternoon, and the market was only open for three and a half days throughout the week. In addition, although the political and economic unrest in New York and Lyon had subsided, the abundant silk inventory did not stimulate demand, and the telegrams turned silent. The price of Shanghai White Filature had fallen back to the lowest level seen in June and July of this year. Therefore, silk factories in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, and Jiaxing took advantage of the low prices to purchase raw silk for winter silk fabrics. Although silk sales were not quiet, silk prices remained low. However, in the second half of the week, Japanese silk prices in Yokohama and Kobe soared by 43 Japanese yen per picul. The news spread to the European and American markets, and the silk market gradually became active. New York Japanese silk prices soared by several tens of cents per pound, and Shanghai White Filature also rose by 8 to 9 cents. Lyon Japanese silk prices rose by 6 to 7 francs, and Chinese silk factory dry spun silk prices rose by 4 to 5 francs (per kilogram). Unfortunately, silk sales were sluggish, and Japanese silk prices at the weekend showed signs of weakening again. This was because Yokohama Japanese silk futures prices fell back by more than ten Japanese yen last Friday. After a sharp decline, it may be difficult to stabilize. Last week, Shanghai silk merchants traded more than 200 bales of raw silk, and exported more than 400 bales of raw silk. The following is a list of Chinese silk prices in the European and American markets at the end of last week (New York price per pound, unit: US dollars; Lyon price per kilogram, unit: francs):</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Rice Market Remains Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 30 boats arrived at South Shanghai, but trade between urban and rural areas remained inactive. The price of Bai Daoyao variety decreased slightly by 10 to 20 cents. The opening prices of Su Tong and Chang Xi white japonica were set, and the market situation turned negative. Prices of 2.20 yuan per picul were common, and overall prices were weak. Du Yangjian was sold as soon as it arrived, and prices increased by several cents.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, more than 40 boats arrived at the Suzhou River bank in Xinzha, and sales on this street were normal. Northern japonica prices were stable for top-quality goods, and ordinary goods fell by 10 to 20 cents. Early japonica from Ningbo still had demand, and prices remained unchanged. There was no gain or loss in the Lu Bu Jian market. About 3,000 piculs of various goods were opened.</p>
<h3>Coal and White Coal Dust Sales Brisk, Prices High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of various types of white coal dust were quite brisk, as coal briquette factories in the city purchased large quantities, and the market was very strong. 300 tons of Hongqi were sold for 9.5 taels, 350 tons of Mark dust for 8.75 taels, 200 tons of Liujiang dust for 6 taels, 120 tons of Shanxi dust for 8.25 taels, and 100 tons of Fengtian dust for 9.5 taels.</p>

<h3>Women's Occupations in Europe</h3>
<p>— Ren Lun</p>
<p>丨Written Before Chinese Women's Occupations丨</p>
<p>Women's occupations are extremely common in Europe. From company managers to newspaper vendors and postal workers, women have a hand in everything. The doormen of public residences in Paris are mostly women. The positions that men have always held have been half taken away by women in Europe. The reasons for this are: first, there are more women than men in Europe, so women inevitably have to become self-reliant as a result of numerical necessity; second, the rising cost of living in Europe and the increasing vanity of women mean that, on the one hand, men avoid marriage and, on the other hand, the number of women who cannot marry increases daily.</p>
<p>Under the motto of "earn it yourself and spend it yourself!", they mostly spend their wages as they please. Especially with the prevalence of individualism among parents, siblings, and children, it is practically unheard of for children to hand over their earnings to their parents and then ask them for pocket money, as is common in China. As for their spending habits, the first is decoration, being bound by vanity, disregarding their status, and striving to make their clothes increasingly fashionable. Especially young women of considerable age and unsettled blood, intoxicated by freedom and unable to distinguish between good and evil, are constantly susceptible to temptation, and they are precisely decorating themselves with the intention of being tempted. Every holiday, they frequent theaters and dance halls, and their small income is simply not enough.</p>
<p>The Huier Street employment center in Berlin, i.e., what we call a department store, employs thousands of such female clerks. Their ugliness is even more unseen in the Far East. It is said that 80 percent of them suffer from venereal diseases. According to a German newspaper report, a baby born out of wedlock was found in a department store. An investigation revealed that it had been abandoned by a female clerk. As a result, the store conducted a full medical examination of all its employees. Shockingly, out of a thousand female clerks, only two were completely healthy. All the rest were infected with venereal diseases, and the only two healthy ones were young girls aged fifteen and twelve.</p>
<p>Such incidents are not limited to the Huier Street employment center in Germany. Other bank clerks and female ticket sellers at post offices in European countries all have this kind of atmosphere. Even England and Ireland, where the atmosphere is more upright, are not exempt. There is only a difference in quality, not quantity. Seeing this, we in China, where women's occupations are still in their infancy, must be aware of what to pay attention to in our enthusiastic promotion.</p>
<h3>Menstruation Does Not Hinder Women's Occupations</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhufeng</p>
<p>丨We Must No Longer Hold This Old European Idea丨</p>
<p>Those who oppose women competing with men for jobs invariably say that women have a unique physiological and intellectual defect not found in men, namely menstruation. This view is not only held by the Chinese, but also by conservatives in the West, such as F. Harrison, who said: "Even if we recognize that men and women are equal in all abilities, menstruation clearly shows the difference in the ability of the two sexes to work." In 1909, the Russian Vozgovsky publicly stated the results of his experiments.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Hanlun applying her beauty skills.</p>
<p>Ms. Hanlun is a famous movie star who, after leaving the film industry, specialized in beauty skills in Paris. After returning to China, she founded the "Hanlun Beauty Salon" on Avenue Joffre, pioneering women's occupations. (Shen Bao Photographic Society)</p>
<p>, saying that menstruation does have an impact on certain psychology. In fact, he is not credible, because his experiments involved only six women, and all six knew their purpose, so they could not reveal their true feelings. Moreover, the detailed process of his experiments was not described, so we cannot immediately recognize that his conclusions are correct.</p>
<p>In 1914, Dr. AE Arnold published his detailed study of the relationship between his female disciples and menstruation in the January issue of the American Sports Magazine. Based on his experience as a doctor and teacher, he believes that there is no reliable scientific reason for female students not to attend class because of menstruation. At the same time, another female doctor, HollingWorth, conducted long-term and detailed experiments on the issue of women's menstruation, focusing on the speed of intellectual and volitional movements, as well as stability and fatigue, etc. The results proved by the 23 people tested that menstruation does not hinder the development of women's intelligence. Based on this, we cannot use menstruation as a weakness of women and strongly argue that women are therefore not qualified to engage in specialized occupations.</p>
<p>But in reality, there are still many knowledgeable women who are limited by old ideas and the long-standing social discrimination, and they inevitably feel discouraged psychologically and are willing to yield to men; which is a pity. Examining the current social causes of the underdevelopment of women's occupations, although there are many reasons, the deep-rooted old ideas and the unwavering belief of the intellectuals in the women's world; this is truly an attitude of self-closure and ignorance. If not, then the new women should remove this old psychology as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Consider those who argue that women need to give way to men because of menstruation, why don't they allow the female workers they employ to rest temporarily when menstruation comes? Nurses in hospitals are not allowed to rest temporarily because of menstruation; think about it, isn't it worth exposing?</p>
<p>Note: This article is mostly based on the aforementioned thesis of female doctor HollingWorth, excerpted and translated with intent. Readers of her article cannot but feel her spirit of actively promoting women's occupations; I am ashamed that I cannot reach even one-tenth of her level.</p>
<h3>The Two Obstacles to Women's Occupations</h3>
<p>— Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>丨One is after marriage, and the other is after having children丨</p>
<p>In Chinese society, where customs have long favored men over women, people generally hold two unfavorable attitudes towards women: one is to treat them as toys for men to vent their desires, as if they were prostitutes; the other is to treat them as laborers who serve in the household, as if they were servants. It is pitiful that women have been living under such humiliation for thousands of years, and it is only now that they can finally hold their heads high. People are singing the song of equality between men and women, trying their best to break down the barriers between the two sexes and absolutely make men and women stand on an equal footing. Therefore, women also have the opportunity to serve society. However, under the current social system, women's occupations still cannot escape two obstacles, so that they cannot continue to work hard all the time:</p>
<p>For young girls under the protection of their families, schooling or serving is generally not a problem; because they do not bear any family responsibilities at all, so they are called "open their mouths to eat and stretch their legs to sleep." Wealthy families, of course, have servants to serve them, and poor families also have parents to do it for them, and they cannot bear to let their beloved daughters spend a little effort. But once they marry, under the strict control of their in-laws and among jealous sisters-in-law, no matter what, they cannot tolerate your coming home late after leaving early, and completely enjoying material comforts; therefore, women after marriage, unless they are in a small family and their husbands must be extremely understanding, can have no obstacles to their occupations; otherwise, they can only quit their jobs and take care of the family as housewives. Even if they break through the first obstacle, they may not be able to overcome the second obstacle once they have children! The care of a wet nurse is never as good as taking care of the child yourself. Unless you sew a pocket and carry the child on your back and go out and return with the mother, how can this be done? Therefore, I believe that if women's occupations are to be smooth and unimpeded, we must design to remove these two obstacles!</p>

<h3>The Boat Girls of South Lake</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>丨Healthy Beauty Surpasses Modern Women丨</p>
<p>When you arrive at the Jiaxing train station and act like a leisurely tourist, you will be surrounded by many people of the opposite sex. "Want a boat? Going to Misty Rain Tower?" they call out charmingly. Among them are elderly grandmothers, young women, and beautiful young girls. In terms of their profession, we don't distinguish between young and old, and simply call them all "boat girls."</p>
<p>Speaking of the boat girls' attire, they are laborers, so of course they can't compare with the fashionable clothes of young ladies, but they are neatly and cleanly dressed. Their skin color, exposed to the wind and sun, certainly can't be described as fair and tender, but their round arms, thick calves, and brown skin tone perfectly match the current popular idea of "healthy beauty."</p>
<p>Their profession is to row a small boat, ferrying visitors to Misty Rain Tower. Their daily income is uncertain. On good days, especially in hot weather, a round trip can earn a dollar, totaling three or four dollars. On slow days, they might have to go for thirty or forty cents, which is very pitiful.</p>
<p>South Lake is a very round and complete lake, like a pane of glass. Unfortunately, it lacks green mountains on all sides, which is nature's way of not fully completing it. Otherwise, it would compete with West Lake. In the center of the lake is Misty Rain Tower, with its layered buildings and pavilions, shrouded in weeping willows. The scenery is quite lovely. In hot weather, it is even more pleasant to take a fan boat to the tower to cool off. Therefore, the boat girls rely on this lake, this tower, especially during the long, hot summer, to earn a good income.</p>
<p>"An old pearl is worthless." The boat girls, being laborers, must also have this sentiment. Elderly women and young wives don't earn much money per trip. However, young and fashionable girls are different, which leads to many evils. Some frivolous young men use the guise of touring the lake by boat to flirt and seduce. As the saying goes, "The drunkard's intention is not in the wine," this applies to these people. As for the boat girls, without much effort, they are happy to earn more money, without considering that they are disgracing the laboring class. This "pest of women's occupations" should be restrained and punished by local figures.</p>
<p>Most of the boat girls are local village women, with yellow hair, bare feet, and slightly dark skin. They have a natural charm. South Lake is filled with half a lake of water caltrop. Among the fragrant water caltrop flowers, set against the charming and healthy boat girls, there is a sense of artistry and poetic scenery. "Suitable for viewing from afar, but not for frivolous play" is what I hope for the tourists.</p>
<h3>Research on Women's Employment Issues</h3>
<p>— Yuan Tui</p>
<p>"Education" is the most urgent work丨</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Republic of China, there were women's revolutionary armies and women's political participation associations, but they were short-lived and could not establish a foundation for women's employment. Currently, female staff members are employed in various departments and ministries and provincial offices, such as clerks and secretaries. Although their abilities and knowledge in handling affairs are not inferior to male staff members, ignorant people outside often call them "red vases," implying that they are only for decoration and do not contribute to practical use.</p>
<p>Furthermore, companies and stores, in order to attract customers, often hire female receptionists and sales clerks. When An Shi intended to, he paid attention to women's employment. As things shifted, they even selected a queen, which was not initially expected. I argue that the issue of women's employment is not about a few women who are struggling with marriage and need the help of a women's department. The total number of women in China is about 200 million. Excluding elderly women and newborn girls, there are approximately 100 million middle-aged women and young girls. Among them, I don't know if there are one or two literate people out of ten thousand. Therefore, in studying women's employment now, we should first popularize education, especially promoting half-day schools for women as the first prerequisite.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in Nanjing, there were seven or eight maids in my house. These seven or eight maids were not bought with money, but were the daughters of male and female servants. They ate free meals and provided some service. This was common in large families, but its nature was charitable. When I was sick at home, I taught them to read and write every day. All the young and old children of the neighbors and the young female servants who were willing to attend were taught. This school had no name, so it was called a half-day elementary school for women in the neighborhood. The textbooks were purchased and sent by me, and four tutors were added. Although the school was nominally half-day, it was actually open from morning to night, with eight classes, because these were servants, and they all had things they needed to do, so each lecture was determined by the number of people. If it can be promoted nationwide, many female teachers are needed. In the past, women were engaged in spinning and weaving, but now that there are machines, women have nothing to do all day long, and some do odd jobs. Chinese women must all be literate, or farm, or work, or open shops, in order to have a way to survive. This so-called issue of employment for the majority of women in the country is not something that a few modern women are studying!</p>
<h3>Women's Employment and Treatment</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>丨Relates to Racial Health丨</p>
<p>Today, excellent female talents appear in various businesses. The possibility of women's employment is undoubtedly no longer a question. However, according to the research results of scientists, the concerns about the physiological defects of women should not be ignored. According to the investigation by Dr. Iting of the production conditions of female workers and higher-class women in Stockholm, Sweden, from 1919 to 1922, it was found that the possibility of pregnancy for female workers was 25% lower than that of women in the upper classes, and the infant mortality rate of female workers was 26% higher than that of women in the upper classes. See Oriental Magazine Reprint 丨丨 The prevalence of this maternal disease, malnutrition, is certainly one of the reasons, but even worse is the long periods of sitting and standing, which can affect the development of women's pelvises. This kind of harm not only affects women themselves, but also affects the race.</p>
<p>This is not a defect of women's employment itself, but a defect of the current social system 丨丨 the poor treatment of working women. Therefore, the only way to avoid this kind of harm is to improve treatment:</p>
<p>㈠ Reduce working hours,</p>
<p>㈡ Increase wages,</p>
<p>㈢ Improve the equipment for female workers,</p>
<p>㈣ There must be adequate rest before and after childbirth.</p>
<p>An ancient saying: "It is better to rely on yourself than to ask others for help." On the one hand, political or social efforts must be made for assistance. On the other hand, women's own unity and efforts are still necessary.</p>
<h3>Classification of Japanese Women's Occupations</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>丨Can be divided into four categories: intellectual, technical, and physical丨</p>
<p>Promoting women's rights, implementing gender equality, and advocating women's employment have become popular slogans in this new China of the 20th century! However, now, the general new women, relying on a surge of enthusiasm, run around and call out, advocating women's employment, but in the end, they do not see much effect.</p>
<p>An old friend, Mr. Rong, who studied in Japan, returned to China last year due to national difficulties. Yesterday, I met him by chance, and we talked intimately. Later, Mr. Rong talked about the women's occupations in Tokyo, which are very developed. Now, I will describe them in detail below.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Rong, women's occupations in Tokyo are roughly divided into four types:</p>
<p>㈠ Intellectual: such as primary and secondary school teachers, kindergarten nannies, tutors, female doctors, female shop assistants, clerks, postmen, ticket sellers, female reporters, female detectives, librarians, women guards, etc.;</p>
<p>㈡ Technical: such as typists, midwives, accountants, nurses, beauticians, tailors, telephone operators, graphic designers, hairdressers, telecommunications operators, etc.; ㈢ Intellectual and technical: such as actors, actresses, musicians, painters, pianists, etc.;</p>
<p>㈣ Physical: such as dispatch women (similar to female servants in our country), models, waitresses, hotel waitresses (waitresses are female servants), female workers, etc.</p>
<p>The above four types are just a general overview. Due to space limitations, I have to be brief.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Women's Occupations</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Calling them "vases" or "living billboards" is insulting to women. Is it possible to despise women with occupations? I think women's occupations can be divided into three types: The first type is to be a teacher; the second type is to be a businesswoman; and the third type is to be a female worker. In the past, women had no ability to be independent and relied on men, which was very restrictive. On the men's side, the burden was also very heavy. Therefore, when a daughter was born, they said she was a "money-losing commodity." If women have occupations and can be independent, it will lighten the burden on men and allow themselves to be free. It is a very good method. Moreover, the current marriage problem for women is difficult to solve. Do parents make the decision? As a result, things often go wrong: those who are high are not worthy, and those who are low are unwilling to accept. It is really a difficult thing for parents. If women have occupations, they will naturally have social interactions, and their own marriage problems will be easier to solve. Therefore, the "women's occupation problem" is closely related to the "marriage problem."</p>
<p>To promote women's occupations, we must first promote women's education. Therefore, parents must send their daughters to school to study so that they can find noble occupations in the future. If they have not received sufficient education, where can they find good occupations! Women with occupations must still study domestic affairs and manage household affairs. Under no circumstances can they ignore domestic affairs. At the same time, they must work and study concurrently, and they should improve their intelligence in their spare time, reading and studying work, and the two should advance together. Then, they can find better occupations, and the future is even more promising.</p>
<h3>The Decline of Women's Occupations</h3>
<p>— Wang Dingjiu</p>
<p>The high tide of the times has created the good fortune for women. Large teams of women, waving bright flags, marched forward, standing on the same level as men. "Women's employment" is a way to survive in the midst of the battle!</p>
<p>The new women after the liberation initially made some achievements. But looking at the current situation, one can't help but sigh. Their future is declining!</p>
<p>The facts tell us that the so-called "women's employment" is still a four-character slogan. Only a few can truly establish a foundation and expand the territory for their own occupations. Otherwise, why do female office workers have the nickname "vase"? Most women still tend to be pampered by money, willing to be playthings of men?</p>
<p>Therefore, the result of "women's employment" is that those with high talents become "officials' wives," and those with lower talents become "waitresses." The sisters all drill towards the decadent road, not towards the road to success. There are no amazing women who go to the northwest, but they all put in effort in front of the dressing table!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, our men should also bear part of the responsibility. They should not be destroyers of "women's employment." They should uphold the spirit of human mutual assistance, eliminate the hedgehog-like thoughts, and abandon the attitude of inaction, so as not to hinder the progress of "women's employment" and achieve a state of coexistence and common prosperity.</p>
<p>The sisters should also recognize the current serious situation. The crisis is imminent. Men must take up arms to defend the country. You should be fully responsible for the rear, and carry out a true "pacifying the interior and resisting foreign aggression." The vigorous development of "women's employment" in various countries was caused by the European War. The once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is now at hand. Work hard!</p>
<h3>In Front of the Bomei Company</h3>
<p>— Shen Bao Photography Agency</p>
<p>The Bomei Company is located at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road. It was founded by staff of the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association and specializes in manufacturing and selling women's products.</p>
<h3>Short News</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Recently, more than a dozen ladies including Liu Wencai, Ling Qishi, and Liang Peishu, in view of the importance of women's employment, jointly founded a Yuyuan Store at the Yuyuan Road entrance of Jing'an Temple. Not only are all the shareholders women, but also the managers and staff are all women. This promotes the true spirit of women's employment and seeks the development of women's occupations. The store is currently in progress, and the goods sold include women's supplies, children's daily necessities, food and beverages, etc., with domestic products and self-made products as the majority. It should be officially opened in early next month.</p>
<h3>Conversations About Women's Occupations</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>(Women's employment has long been recognized as one of the most important issues for modern women. This magazine has specially compiled a special issue to openly discuss it in order to arouse the excitement of the women's community. We decided in advance to openly solicit contributions and solicit opinions from experts. The so-called opinions are focused on practical matters and not on empty talk. Therefore, the owner of Ziluolan An thought of Madam Tan Yasheng, the general manager of Yunshang Company, who is currently the most active in advocating women's employment, Madam Gan Jinrong. After his introduction, Madam Tan was very happy and invited me to visit Yunshang and talk about issues related to women's employment.)</p>
<p>Initially, There Were Three Motivations</p>
<p>Madam Tan said straight to the point, "When I took over Yunshang, there were three motivations that came from my heart. I myself regret very much why I didn't start serving society in my golden age, but now I am initially trying the taste of it? I cannot be a pioneer of women's employment, but a laggard of modern women. Wouldn't that be self-conscious!" She changed her tone and said, "However, ordinary women enter the professional world as soon as they leave school, while I have fulfilled the responsibilities of the family and come to repay my long-held wish. This is the first motivation. In recent years, the decline of China's social economy has become irreversible. Perhaps the biggest reason is the dumping of foreign goods and the outflow of profits. Therefore, promoting domestic goods cannot be delayed. I really want to improve women's clothing, change to domestic materials, and shift the wrong idea of women's worshiping foreign goods. This is the second motivation. Yunshang is the product of the hard work of many gentlemen in the literary and artistic circles. If no one is responsible for it and let it evolve naturally, the result will be disappointing to many people. I decided to revitalize it. This is the third motivation."</p>
<p>Related to Women's Decoration</p>
<p>Here, I also think of women's decoration. Modern women, in terms of clothing and beauty, competing for novelty and beauty, has become a common psychology. Among them, I have discovered several interesting facts: There is a kind of Europeanized woman. The clothing or cosmetics she needs in her mind must be bought from foreign countries to be satisfactory. For example, for robe materials, she will not buy domestic georgette, but she must buy foreign lace; for domestic furs, such as fox gray backs, she will not buy them, but she must buy foreign silk, and so on. The psychology of worshiping foreign goods is really inexplicable. There is a kind of women's clothing that is too irrational. They want to be fashionable and decorate well, but they have never paid attention to what kind of clothes are suitable for what occasions? In what season should you wear what kind of clothes? What I said above is the so-called irrational meaning? Unless you are wearing ordinary clothes, it doesn't matter, otherwise there are certain formats for morning, forenoon, afternoon, and evening. For example, modern young ladies or wives wear evening dresses during the day, plus a gray-backed fur coat and gold leather shoes. It is not surprising to go to a grand banquet or dance hall in such dazzling fashion. If you run to Wang Baohe Restaurant or Wufangzhai Noodle Restaurant, wouldn't it be ridiculous? So I think women's clothing, if you don't pay attention to it, it's fine. If you pay attention to it, it must be rational, especially in public places, it is even more important.</p>
<p>Prospects for Women's Employment</p>
<p>I have always been very interested in women's occupations, because I missed the opportunity before, so I admire women with occupations and have great hope for them. Now I will analyze three types of women: ㈠ Married women; ㈡ Women who are currently in the professional world; ㈢ Girls who are preparing for employment in their study days. What I hope for them is that married women have very important responsibilities for handling domestic affairs, the kindness of their husbands, and the upbringing of their children. Being good at managing the family and being a good wife and mother has fulfilled the duties of a woman. Even if she does not work in the professional world, her contribution to society and the country is already very significant, so there is no need to be confined to serving outside; women who are already in the professional world should strengthen their will, respect their own status and reputation, not be tempted by money, and not be fascinated by emotions, to break the encirclement of the current bad environment and open up a bright road; girls in school days should first consider their own ambitions and circumstances and prepare early. When they have sufficient knowledge and have learned the methods of dealing with people, things, and the world, there will be no difficulties in being incompatible with society.</p>
<p>Commonly Seen Malpractices</p>
<p>Most female comrades in the professional world can strive to be upward, but at the same time, several malpractices have been discovered, such as: ㈠ Being fond of novelty and fashion, over-decorating, giving people the nickname of red vase; ㈡ Having less sense of responsibility for their duties; ㈢ For the sake of vanity, they often change their minds and have no perseverance; ㈣ Going out to serve and abandoning the natural duties of the family. Let me give an example: A certain lady is very talented. Since taking office as the secretary of a certain provincial government, she must travel by car and is very generous. The monthly salary is not enough to support herself. She entrusts her children at home to maids and does not take care of them at all. A'nan cries hungry and cold all day long, and A'da and A'er either quarrel with the children next door or break their foreheads and scalps. Such a gain does not outweigh the loss. Misunderstanding the true meaning of women's employment, no one will agree with it, right?</p>
<p>Madam Tan talked very enthusiastically, but unfortunately it was too early, so I ended the interview.</p>

The secretary received the reporter and said that after the Board of Directors and Supervisors is established at 8:00 AM on the 14th, he will go to the Bureau at 9:00 AM to take over. Gao Tingzi, Director of Navigation Affairs of the Ministry of Communications, is responsible for the Supervision Department. The Board of Directors is responsible by the Board of Directors, and the General Manager is responsible for the General Manager's Office. All reception personnel have been designated and will take over at the same time.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting at Song's Residence: At 2:00 PM yesterday, Vice President Song invited Minister of Communications Zhu Jia骅, newly appointed General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau Liu Hongsheng, directors and supervisors Qin Runqing, Hu Yunzhuang, Hu Bijiang, Qin Zuze, Zhang Xiaolin, Yang Ying, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Sheng Pinchen, Shi Liangcai, Lu Jianquan, Ye Zuotang, Yu Qiaqing, etc. to exchange views on the mortgage of the Sanjian and the leasing of the wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. It was decided to hold a discussion meeting at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM to discuss the solution.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Meeting: Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications and the directors and supervisors, in order to understand the content of the mortgage of the Sanjian and the lease of the wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, agreed to hold a discussion meeting at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those present were Minister of Communications Zhu Jia骅, Director of Navigation Affairs Gao Tingzi, Mayor Wu, Liu Hongsheng, Qin Runqing, Hu Yunzhuang, Hu Bijiang, Qin Zuze, Yang Ying, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Sheng Pinchen, Shi Liangcai, Lu Jianquan, Ye Zuotang, Yu Qiaqing, and former manager Li Guojie.</p>
<p>▲ Li Detained: Former General Manager Li Guojie was also invited to attend and report. Those present believed that the contract and lease agreement were of great importance and could not be resolved without considerable time for research. They all agreed that the matter should be discussed after the establishment of the Board of Directors and Supervisors and the new General Manager took office. Li Guojie also admitted the errors in the procedures and reported himself. After the meeting, the Municipal Government, at 5:00 PM, received orders to place Li under temporary surveillance pending investigation. Director of Public Security Bureau Wen Hongen accompanied him to the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention pending orders. Li's servant also followed to the Public Security Bureau and then returned to the residence to report. It is heard that he was treated quite well.</p>
<p>▲ Resignation En Masse: Cai Cheng, Chief Secretary of the China Merchants Bureau, Secretaries Liu Ruxiang and Yang Ruinian, Accounting Director Zhou Shuwen, Deputy Director Shou Yiqun, General Affairs Director Zhu Suixuan, Deputy Director Li Zhiping, Shipping Director Wang Tong, Business Director Liu Tianji, and Property Director Jing Yuanming resigned to General Manager Li Guojie yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Mortgage Details: According to Yang Ruinian, Secretary of the China Merchants Bureau, in a responsible interview with a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, General Manager Li, in order to save the Bureau's affairs, had obtained the approval of the former Minister of Communications, Chen Mingshu, and the approval and filing of the supervisor Chen Fumu for the three plans of purchasing new ships on credit, wharf loans, and construction loans. Therefore, he mortgaged to the American China Trading Company for a loan of ten million taels (not ten million yuan), using the Zhongbei and Huasan wharves as collateral. The new wharf was entrusted by the Bureau to the China Trading Company for management and was not within the mortgaged property. The mortgage contract can prove this. In addition to General Manager Li, Supervisor Chen also signed the loan contract. The benefits of the wharf loan are detailed in the book "The Revival of the China Merchants Bureau" (which was published in various newspapers yesterday).</p>
<p>▲ Approval Instructions: Secretary Yang also showed the reporter from the Central News Agency the instructions issued by the Supervision Department on September 3rd, which are recorded as follows: Instructions from the Supervision Department of the China Merchants Bureau of the Ministry of Communications: "The submitted mortgage contracts, loan contracts, lease agreements, and explanatory documents have all been received. The debts of the China Merchants Bureau are accumulated, and the ships and warehouses are dilapidated, resulting in a monthly income of more than 100,000 yuan, which is not enough to cover expenses. If thorough improvements are not made as soon as possible, bankruptcy will inevitably occur. According to the report, we have contacted the American China Trading Company, the Dalae Shipping Company, and others regarding the construction loans in the Bund and Fuzhou Road areas of Shanghai, the mortgage of the Shanghai Zhongbei and Huaxin Nanwu wharves, the lease agreement of the Shanghai Zhongbei and Huasan wharves, and the memorandum of understanding on purchasing ships on credit. After repeated consultations by the former Commissioner Guo Waifeng and the General Manager, and after review by this department, the articles of the contract are feasible and should be approved and filed in accordance with the regulations. The General Manager is instructed to sign the above-mentioned contracts with the American merchants, etc., and the borrowed funds should be used entirely for the purpose of clearing outstanding debts. All the remaining funds should be designated for construction and production, so as to turn the tide of the stagnant situation and avoid the loan being wasted and increasing debts. You must comply with this order. The attached documents are stored concurrently. Supervisor Chen Fumu."</p>
<p>▲ Staff Petition: The Five Wharf Workers' Union of the Bureau held a joint meeting of all group leaders on the mortgage of the wharf and resolved to oppose it. It was decided to send representatives Yu Xianting, Xue Yinkui, Zhang Guiqing, Shi Jizhang, Cheng Changsheng, and group leaders Xia Zhende, Wang Xingcun, Lin Shengxue Xingbiao, Zhao Zurong, etc. to the General Bureau at 10:00 AM today to petition the new director against the mortgage loan and demand the outstanding salaries for October.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Flew to Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Delivered an Important Speech Before Departure</p>
<p>Describing the Reasons for the Reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau</p>
<p>Developing the Shipping Industry to Benefit Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, flew from Hankou to Hangzhou the day before yesterday to inspect the aviation school and returned to Shanghai in the afternoon. Yesterday, Song delivered a speech on the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau and invited Liu Hongsheng, Shi Liangcai, Ye Zuotang, and others to his residence at 3:30 PM to discuss matters related to the China Merchants Bureau. At 4:20 PM, Song, accompanied by his secretary Huang Chundao, took a plane to Hangzhou. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Song Delivers Speech: Song said in his speech yesterday: "The shipping industry is closely related to national transportation, agriculture, industry, and commerce. Among the shipping companies in China, the China Merchants Bureau was established the earliest and has the largest scale. The government has maintained it through various means, but internal conflicts often arise among the shareholders, and the administrators are incapable, leading to numerous malpractices and increasing corruption. Looking at the foreign shipping companies established at the same time as the China Merchants Bureau, they have all expanded more than tenfold, but the China Merchants Bureau has only regressed and not progressed. The ships are outdated, most of them are more than 30 years old, and many have sunk over the years. Not only is the company's loss immeasurable, but the safety of passengers and goods is also worrying, and the shipping industry is declining day by day, and shipping rights are deteriorating day by day, which is a fundamental concern for the country and society. Since the establishment of the National Government, supervisors have been repeatedly dispatched to supervise and reorganize the situation, but the situation is too complicated and difficult to reorganize. The development of national agriculture, industry, and commerce is advancing in tandem with the shipping industry. If the shipping industry cannot be reorganized, the agriculture, industry, and commerce will be affected. The China Merchants Bureau was established the earliest, and the location occupied by the wharf is superior to any company. However, for various reasons, it cannot fulfill its function to serve the society. At the same time, dividends have not been paid for more than ten years. In the past three years, the market price of stocks has averaged only thirty taels per set. In view of the importance of the shipping industry and for the sake of the shareholders, the government has decided to nationalize the China Merchants Bureau, and all stocks are set at fifty taels in cash per set, which has been submitted to the Central Political Council for resolution and approval. The government is willing to pay this relatively high price at a time of financial difficulty, hoping to create a modern shipping company on the existing foundation to promote the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce. The shareholders have not received interest for more than ten years, and the government's offer to recover at a price exceeding the market price by twenty taels shows the government's preferential intention, and most are happy to accept it. At the same time, although the government has taken over the nationalization, it still appoints people with prestigious reputation from all walks of life to take charge of the matter. In view of the past history of the China Merchants Bureau and the current situation of various countries, the government's management of the shipping industry by ordinary officials will be ineffective. Secondly, the concentration of forces from all walks of life can make the shipping industry easier to reorganize. Thirdly, this time is entirely for the purpose of developing the social economy and agriculture, industry, and commerce, so the directors and supervisors appointed are absolutely unrelated to politics. After that, the political situation may change, but the foundation of the China Merchants Bureau will not be shaken by it. The China Merchants Bureau has accumulated huge losses, and this year has already lost more than 1.7 million. The government's nationalization at this time has no benefits to speak of. One is that the global economic situation is not good, the second is that the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau takes time, and the third is that the government's purpose is to promote the development of the shipping industry to benefit agriculture, industry, and commerce. After the takeover, the loss-making routes must also be carried out, from domestic routes to foreign routes, even at the cost of sacrifice. Since the government is frankly seeking benefits for the people, it hopes that all sectors of society will unite and work together, and everyone will regard the reorganization and development of the China Merchants Bureau as an important responsibility, so that the progress of China's shipping industry can be expected."</p>
<p>▲ Flight to Hangzhou: At 3:30 PM yesterday, Song invited Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, Shi Liangcai, Standing Director, Ye Zuotang, Du Yuesheng, Yang Ying, Directors Qian Xinzhi, Hu Yunzhuang, Hu Bijiang, Wang Xiaolai, Supervisors Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runqing, Lu Xuepu, and others to Song's residence on Qiqi Road to discuss the problem of the China Merchants Bureau. The meeting lasted about half an hour before it was dismissed. Song then took a car to Hongqiao Airport and boarded a Sikorsky plane at 4:10 PM and flew to Hangzhou. Duan, the consultant of Zhang Xueliang, is still staying in Hankou and did not come to Shanghai with Song this time.</p>
<h3>Triumphant News from the Northeast National Salvation Army</h3>
<p>Li Haifeng's Telegram: Yan Baowei, the representative of the Northeast National Anti-Japanese Salvation Army stationed in Shanghai, received a telegram from Li Haifeng, the commander of the First Division of the First Route of the Army, reporting on the front-line situation and the demolition of the Jin-Yi Railway. The text of the telegram is as follows: "Our army destroyed the railway between Jinzhou and Yixian on the day of the invasion (12th), preparing to contact the friendly troops in western Liaoning, Geng Jizhou and others, to launch a general offensive against Jinzhou. According to reconnaissance reports, the Japanese invaders in that area are finding it difficult to use their planes after the heavy snow, and the soldiers are suffering from stomach cold and making independent decisions. There are rumors that they have automatically withdrawn from Jinzhou. However, a part of the Japanese invaders in Yixian have their retreat cut off by our army and are extremely panicked. Our army has decided to divide its troops and suppress them, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them."</p>
<p>▲ Huang Yongping's Telegram: The Shanghai Liaison Office of the General Headquarters of the Northeast National Salvation Army received a triumphant telegram from Huang Yongping, the commander-in-chief of the army, stating: "Since our army participated in the attack on Ningnian by the Soviet-Ma allied forces, it has won and lost repeatedly, no less than ten times. The bravery and hardships of our army are truly the elite of the allied forces. Now, on the day of Qin (13th), we have captured Ningnian again and plan to make some adjustments before advancing to the Molinsi area."</p>
<p>▲ Wang Delin's Report: The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter from the Shanghai Liaison Office of Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese National Salvation Army, stating: "Dear Sir, we hereby enclose two copies of the report and hope that you will review them and widely promote them, so as to obtain more assistance. (Report) According to Sun Zi, a communication officer sent by Yang Fuhai, commander of the Eleventh Route, the recent military situation in Andong is as follows: On September 19, Jin Xiushan led two regiments of troops from Andong and engaged the Japanese army on the 21st, and then repulsed the enemy troops at Dagushan. The battle was extremely fierce at 9:00 PM that night, and the puppet army Commander Li Shoushan was surrounded in Dagushan. Recently, an internal conflict occurred, and the Japanese suspected that Commander Li was colluding with us, so they immediately shot his brother, who was the commander of the battalion, causing Commander Li Shoushan to decide to revolt and surrender. First, he killed his deputy commander (Japanese) Zhang Zhongnan and then led his troops to join us, bringing 500 bags of supplies and a large cart of bullets, which were transported by the Ganlong small boat of Andong County to our army headquarters. In this battle, more than 200 enemy troops were killed. Our side lost one company commander and 37 soldiers, and 40 soldiers were wounded. In addition, Jiang Quane, commander of the Yalu River, has joined Jin and Li, who surrendered, and led 1,500 policemen and 200 bags of supplies and a large cart of bullets to attack Kuandian County. They are now actively fighting to the death. Our army's headquarters is currently located in Dali Jiabaozi, Dagushan. However, the weather is extremely cold, and the snow is everywhere. Most of the soldiers are wearing only thin coats to cover their bodies, and they are extremely painful. We urgently need assistance as soon as possible, and we also ask for generous compensation for the fallen company commanders and soldiers. In addition, there are more than 4,000 soldiers of our army stationed in Kaiyuan, and they have now occupied the area. After three days and nights of bloody battles, the situation of capturing it within the day will continue to develop secretly." (Report II) According to Qu Tingfu's report, "I, Tingfu, was secretly sent to the front line to investigate the military situation. I departed from Ping on September 17 and rushed to Dongning County on September 27 to meet Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin. I was sent to inspect the deployment of our army's defense zone, which is extremely strict, and the morale of the army is exceptionally strong. However, the north wind has already started, and the snow is everywhere. Although our army is mostly wearing thin coats, they are extremely painful, but the work of attack and defense has not been relaxed. Then, at the beginning of October, mobilization began, and Vice Commander Kong Xianrong led the troops to engage the Japanese army in fierce battles. On the 16th, they attacked and entered Dongning County and completely recovered it. More than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the rest were exhausted and fled. They urgently mobilized reinforcements. Our side sent Zheng Ying to ambush at the 800-mile Gang area between Hailin Station and Henghe Station and destroyed the railway. The next morning, the Japanese reinforcements arrived. Both sides attacked each other in that area, and almost all the Japanese troops were overturned and killed under the iron wheels, reaching hundreds of people. Our army took the opportunity to encircle and kill a total of 400 enemy troops, seizing nine machine guns, 7,000 bullets, one heavy artillery gun, and a large number of rifles, as well as countless other supplies and military supplies. When Tingfu was secretly ordered by Commander-in-Chief Wang to return to Ping, our army was dispatching two brigades to attack Tieling River, 80 miles away from Hailin, and two brigades were dispatched from Dunhua to attack Yimianpo, 100 miles away from Gaolingzi, and victory will be achieved soon."</p>
<h3>Annual General Meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Economic Society</h3>
<p>Chen Guangfu and Li Fusun Give Important Speeches</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Economic Society held its 4th First Annual General Meeting and Academic Lecture at the Banking Club yesterday. Dai Ailu, Jin Guobao, Chen Guangfu, Cai Zhengya, Chen Qilu, Ye Yuan, Li Fusun, Li Zhaohuan, Pan Xulun, Xu Xinliu, Wang Zhixin, He Dekui, Xu Yongzuo, Li Fuhou, Zhuang Zhihuan, and others totaling thirty-six people and seven or eight guests were in attendance. At noon, they were seated for lunch, after which the meeting was opened. Chairman Dai Ailu reported that Zhang Gongquan and Chen Guangfu were originally invited to give speeches, but Mr. Zhang had to return to his hometown due to business. Mr. Li Fusun had just returned from Nanyang, so he was invited to give a lecture. Afterwards, Chen Guangfu and Li Fusun gave speeches in succession. Dai Ailu, He Dekui, and others made inquiries, and then discussed the affairs of the society before adjourning. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chen Guangfu's Speech: Mr. Chen's topic was "A Way to Solve China's Economic Problems." He briefly stated that he had recently toured and investigated the Yangtze River and the North for four months, traveling from Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, to Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao, and then returned to Shanghai. He felt that the Yangtze River Basin was the richest area in China, but after the great flood, it was full of scars and could not be restored in a short period of time. The situation in Henan was better than the previous year, as it had not suffered from war and the people were able to live a minimum of security. The facilities of the cultural institutions in Kaifeng were more complete than those in Shanghai. Tianjin was affected by the international depression and the numerous taxes and levies in the Zhangjiakou area, resulting in a decrease in the export of wool and other products, which was quite depressed. The situation in Shandong was even better than that in Henan, because the annual output of tobacco leaves, straw hat cords, food, etc. to other places was worth 200 million yuan. The society had a large amount of circulation, so the current situation was very good. He really felt the greatness of the Chinese people's struggle in terms of livelihood. Once the war stops, the recovery will be quite rapid. However, China's economy is very closely related to international relations and is affected by the world everywhere. This topic only refers to the domestic situation, and whether it can be successful is still uncertain. He hoped that everyone would have opinions to teach him. 1. The Reasons for Capital Flowing to Shanghai: Regarding the problem of cash concentration in Shanghai, some people blamed the banks. In fact, the banks were also very willing to release funds to the interior, but this was not within the banks' ability. The reasons were roughly: A. Political instability and insecurity in the interior; B. Credit tightening: In the past, when tea, silk, wheat, and rice were on the market, cash flowed from Shanghai to the interior. Also, due to the sale of cloth, sugar, kerosene, flour, cigarettes, etc. in the interior, cash flowed back to Shanghai. Compared with previous years, the national trade deficit was supplemented by remittances from overseas Chinese, while the interior was supplemented by credit loans. For example, the loans from Shanghai banks to the Zhenyang area and the loans from Ningbo money houses to Hankou exceeded millions each year. In recent years, the floods have caused many bad debts. As a result, not only were they unwilling to continue lending, but they also gradually recovered the loans that had already been released. The position of the bank was to use funds on behalf of depositors, and the psychology of depositors was to flock to the safest option. If they recognized a slight crisis, they would immediately withdraw their funds. The second was the protection of the law. The old laws have been abolished, and the new laws have not yet become a habit. The debtors are not afraid of the law and even regard defaulting on debts as an honor, especially in the interior. 2. The Problems of Shanghai Itself: Among the new businesses in the past twenty years, the progress of banks has been the fastest. In the early stages of the business, foreigners often laughed at its difficulty in succeeding, but now most of the cash in the country has been concentrated in banks operated by Chinese. However, there are still many weaknesses: A. There is no true bank of banks to back it up; B. Too much investment in speculative businesses; C. The stagnation of industrial loans; D. The value of various stocks has no value as securities and cannot be circulated in society, resulting in a decrease in funds. 3. The Difficulties in Relieving the Rural Areas: The main reason is that the farmers lack knowledge, and they become poorer because of their ignorance, and they become more ignorant because of their poverty. It is not easy to start relief and there is a lack of protection. 4. The Prerequisites for Money to Be Securely Transferred to the Interior: The interior must be peaceful, investors must break the mentality of relying on concessions, and the law must be protected. The ways are: A. For the relief of small and medium-sized cities in the interior, the original financial institutions should be used to fully support good money houses and guide them to gradually shift from credit to people to credit to things; B. For the relief of special rural areas, various cooperatives should be used, such as the Shanghai Bank and the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society's cooperatives in North China and the Wujiang Cooperative in Anhui. The results of lending cooperatives are excellent; C. For the relief of old-fashioned rural areas, the original financial institutions, such as pawnshops, should also be used. The knowledgeable people in the pawnshops in various places should find ways to improve them, reduce interest rates, and cooperate with the financial industry. In terms of business, they should not rush to wear and tear clothes, but should extend to commodities such as rice and wheat, so as to gradually establish cooperatives, etc.</p>
<p>Li Fusun's Speech: Mr. Li's topic was "Observations from a Visit to Nanyang." He briefly stated that he had been in Nanyang for fourteen days, and because the communication was simple and the visits and inspections were arranged in advance, he was able to gain something even though the time was short. Overseas Chinese in Nanyang accounted for six-tenths of the total residents, and almost all commercial and economic power was in the hands of the overseas Chinese. However, in recent years, the price of pepper, rubber, and tin ore has plummeted, resulting in many losses. Most of the overseas Chinese who went to Nanyang in the past did not have concrete plans and long-term vision. At that time, pepper, rubber, and tin ore were very profitable, so some people borrowed money to invest, but they gradually plummeted, and most of them went bankrupt. However, those who operated with their own capital were able to survive with difficulty. Although some of them had thick assets, they had very narrow-minded prejudices and no ambition to cooperate. Most of the overseas Chinese students had no concept of the motherland, but there were also many overseas Chinese compatriots and some overseas Chinese students who loved the country. They remitted 300 million yuan to the motherland every year, but they also felt very painful in their lives, and their businesses were gradually declining. If there was no relief, they would fail completely. Many businesses have been transferred to foreign hands, such as the shipping companies that travel between Nanyang, Shantou, and Xiamen, etc., and a certain company has also been mortgaged to foreign banking groups. However, with the slight increase in the value of rubber, there is still hope for business development to be recovered. The most important thing recently is the merger of the Hua Feng, Overseas Chinese, and Hua Shang banks. In the past, the three banks competed fiercely, and after the lending was contracted, they competed with each other in remittance, resulting in losses for each. The last time Mr. Zhang Gongquan traveled to Nanyang and persuaded them to merge, and after several negotiations, it was finally settled, and the name was set as Overseas Chinese Bank, with a capital of 10 million Singapore dollars, with 40 yuan per share. However, the investment scope was narrow and the capital was lacking, resulting in a market price of only 20 yuan per share. He suggested that a domestic banking group buy a part of the shares to increase capital and avoid being bought by foreign merchants, which is still under consideration. He hoped that Chinese people would export more domestic goods and purchase goods produced and operated by overseas Chinese and invest in established businesses to save the crisis faced by overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Branch Meeting: After the lectures, the affairs of the society were discussed and resolved as follows: 1. Amend Article 9 of the branch's regulations, such as: "In addition to paying the society's fees, members of the branch shall pay 2 yuan per year, and friends of the society shall pay 1 yuan per year." 2. Hold a symposium every month. The topic of discussion next month will be the problem of rural economy. Those who have opinions and wish to join the discussion should notify the branch secretary, Mr. Wang Zhixin. 3. Cai Zhengya reported on the work of the Sino-Japanese Trade Research Association. The statistical work of Sino-Japanese trade has been mostly completed, and the research part of Sino-Japanese trade has been less than Beijing's. It was decided to raise more funds to continue the work.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Overseas Chinese Merchants from Vietnam Petitioning Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Discussing the Petitioning Process</p>
<p>Representatives Offering Opinions</p>
<p>Scheduled to Return to Vietnam by Ship</p>
<p>Due to the Sino-French Vietnam Treaty, which China had already announced but the French government had not yet ratified, goods from China have been cut off, threatening the economic ruin of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Vietnam. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Southern Vietnam decided to send Mr. Huang An and Mr. Xu Yixian back to China to petition the government and negotiate with the French. Last week, they arrived in Beijing from Shanghai, stayed for a week, and petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Yesterday, they returned to Shanghai. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed Mr. Huang and Mr. Xu yesterday at their residence, and they discussed the details of their trip to Beijing to petition.</p>
<p>▲ Petitioning Process</p>
<p>Mr. Xu stated that they arrived in Beijing last Monday and immediately submitted their petitions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. They were graciously received by Minister Luo, Vice Minister Xu, and Commissioners Zhou Qigang, Chen Shuren, and Xiao Jishan of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The representatives explained the suffering of the overseas Chinese, and Minister Luo offered comforting words, saying that the French envoy to China was scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Tuesday and that he would do his best to negotiate with him at that time. Commissioner Zhou and others moved the representatives to the Overseas Chinese Reception Center for accommodation and treated them with great courtesy. On Tuesday, the French envoy arrived in Beijing, and due to foreign custom, negotiations could not begin immediately, but a banquet was held. The next day (Wednesday), they met with Vice Minister Xu Mo, who informed them that the French envoy had telegraphed the French government for instructions regarding the Vietnam treaty, and the future looked promising, as the French envoy's attitude was very positive. The representatives, mindful that the French government had not yet ratified the Vietnam treaty and that the sticking point was the list of goods, requested Vice Minister Xu to hand over the annex to the treaty (i.e., the list of goods) for study, which was granted. The representatives then conducted a lengthy study and found some areas that were not entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>▲ Offering Opinions</p>
<p>The annex to the treaty was divided into two parts, one for China and one for France, listing the most-favored-nation tariff items requested for import by each country. China had twenty-three items listed, while France had only six. Upon closer inspection, the items listed by China, with the exception of a few, such as leather, which were popular in Vietnam, were generally irrelevant to the goods used by overseas Chinese. The six items listed by France were all fast-selling products in China, while the twenty-three items requested by China were actually not applicable to the overseas Chinese in Vietnam. The representatives then requested Vice Minister Xu to introduce them to Zhang Weihan, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, who was familiar with the treaty, to discuss adding silk, tea, porcelain, and Chinese medicinal materials, which were most suitable for the overseas Chinese in Vietnam, to the most-favored-nation tariff list, and also adding the originally specified leather and other items. It was decided that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' European and American Affairs Department would retain the representatives' proposal, who solemnly declared that the principle for future negotiations with the French would be based on the newly revised list of goods. Vice Minister Xu expressed his agreement. The representatives believed that the purpose of their petition had been fulfilled, and they left Beijing to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Consular Visas</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of consular visas, the arrangements for this matter in Vietnam have been properly handled. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a notice, the matter had already been implemented in areas where consulates were stationed. Because the treaty with Vietnam had not yet been finalized and consulates had not been established, the issue of visas could not be discussed. This time, when the two representatives, Huang and Xu, went to Beijing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs entrusted the chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Southern Vietnam with the task of handling cargo visas to facilitate commerce.</p>
<p>▲ Scheduled to Return to Vietnam</p>
<p>It has been two weeks since the representatives Huang and Xu returned to China. Now that everything has been settled, they are scheduled to return to Vietnam on the French mail ship General Metzinger on the 19th of this month. It is reported that the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Association will hold a meeting before the representatives leave Shanghai to discuss assistance to the overseas Chinese and to welcome Mr. Huang and Mr. Xu.</p>
<h3>Aviation Construction Association</h3>
<p>Establishment of Custody and Supervision Committee</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the China Aviation Construction Association has received enthusiastic support from patriotic compatriots at home and abroad. The association solemnly invited bankers, business leaders, prominent lawyers, certified public accountants, and enthusiastic patriots to form a Custody and Supervision Committee for donation matters. Yesterday, at noon, the inaugural meeting was held at the YMCA in Baxianqiao. More than ten custody committee members, including Wen Zongyao, Zhang Rongpu, Wang Zhixin, and Tang Baoshu, and supervision committee members, including Bei Zuyi, Liu Dajun, Shen Junru, Li Wenjie, and Xu Yongzuo, elected Wen Zongyao as chairman. He reported on the preparation process, and then the charter was approved. Permanent members of the custody committee and the chairman of the supervision committee were elected. It was resolved to announce the establishment of the two committees in the newspaper and to notify the banks to collect donations. The meeting ended at 3:00 PM. The list of the two committees is recorded below: Custody Committee: Wu Yunzhai, Xu Xinliu, Zhang Rongpu, Guo Zhongliang, Huo Shouhua, Jian Yingfu, Guo Shun, Tang Baoshu, Wen Qinfu, Hu Mengjia, Qin Runqing, Li Fusun, Wang Zhixin, Lin Kanghou, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Gongquan, Qian Xinzhi. Supervision Committee: Shen Junru, Liu Dajun, Li Wenjie, Bei Zuyi, Jiang Baoli, Xu Yongzuo.</p>
<h3>National Central University</h3>
<p>Responding to the Monthly Donation Campaign</p>
<p>Donating Six Months' Worth of Funds, Advanced by the University</p>
<p>Since the Northeast Refugee Relief Association launched the monthly donation campaign, various circles have responded enthusiastically, as reported previously. It is now learned that President Luo Jialun of National Central University and the deans of various colleges, seeing the declaration of the association's monthly donation campaign, expressed their deep sympathy and also drafted a monthly donation standard, with all faculty and staff donating six months' worth of funds, advanced by the university, to meet the urgent needs of the Northeast. The donation notice is recorded below to inspire schools and institutions in various places to launch their own initiatives, as follows: Donation Notice for the Northeast Volunteer Army: The Northeast Volunteer Army is fighting against the violent Japanese with flesh and blood, and they are now facing a harsh winter with meager clothing and supplies. Various circles have separately initiated the collection of donations. All colleagues at the university have long harbored righteous indignation and will surely be happy to support this cause. A standard has been tentatively drafted, with each person donating one percent of their monthly salary for six months, advanced by the university to meet the urgent needs, which will then be deducted from each person's salary in monthly installments, starting from October and ending in March of next year. Those who voluntarily donate more will be registered in a separate book. Those who, based on their own economic circumstances, need to reduce the standard, please notify the accounting department in advance for registration. The method of advancement and deduction will remain the same. It is imperative that these donations actually reach the Northeast Volunteer Army without any waste. Jialun will be responsible for reporting on this matter afterward to ensure credibility. If there are no objections, it is imperative to act quickly. This is hereby announced for your public observation. Luo Jialun, Zou Shuwen, Tong Guanxian, Lu Enxu, Sun Benwen, Huang Jianzhong, Wang Dong, Zhang Guangyu, respectfully.</p>

<p>National Doctor Wang Juecai sent a letter to this newspaper, stating: Mr. Reporter, in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 11th, there was a news item titled "Pitying Person Transfers Medical Expenses to Aid the Volunteer Army," which stated that "Pitying Person" did not wish to reveal their name and had long suffered from insomnia and was unable to sleep at night. They sought medical treatment, which required injections costing ten yuan each, and it was uncertain when they would be cured. "Pitying Person" believed that it was better to sacrifice their own life to save others, so they generously transferred their medical expenses of 1000 yuan to help the Northeast Volunteer Army. I was deeply moved upon reading this. I have always been fond of studying traditional Chinese medicine and am a member of medical organizations and have a license to practice medicine issued by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau. My intention has always been to care for the suffering of my compatriots, but I have other occupations and little free time. The world is chaotic, and I have no time to spare. Therefore, my medical practice is limited to family members and close friends, and I do not wish to publicize it to outsiders. This is known to those who have had a brief encounter with Juecai. Today, upon seeing this news, I could not help but feel a compassion I have never felt before. Although I do not have the means to donate a large sum of money to aid the volunteer army, I know that a generous donor has a difficult-to-treat disease, and if I remain silent and do not offer help, my conscience would not allow it. Therefore, if "Pitying Person" does not consider Juecai to be unteachable and can tell me about their condition, I am willing to make an exception and provide them with a consultation. I respectfully request that you publish this so that "Pitying Person" may see it and send a letter, or if your newspaper has the address of "Pitying Person," please forward this letter directly to avoid taking up space in your newspaper. Juecai's mailing address is: Translation Department, Shanghai Railway Bureau, No. 257 Old Bazi Road. Also, Juecai has suffered from insomnia in the past, and my wife also suffers from it now. Both of us have been cured using traditional Chinese medicine and have never had a single injection. Juecai's writing of this letter is purely out of a sense of conscience, and all obligations have been fulfilled first. I hope you will take this into consideration. This is a respectful greeting to you, Wang Juecai, written on November 16th.</p>
<h3>Yongchang Shop Attacked with Grenades Yesterday</h3>
<p>Received Warning Letters a Month Ago</p>
<p>Yongchang Silk, Satin, Wool, and Cotton Cloth Shop, owned by Jin Zouting of Suzhou, located at No. 64 Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession, was suddenly attacked by two men in their twenties, wearing Chinese-style clothing, who were loitering in front of the shop at 5:20 PM yesterday. Suddenly, one of them threw a grenade into the shop, which immediately exploded. Fortunately, no one was injured, but four pieces of glass in the doors and windows were broken. The two men took the opportunity to escape when the explosion occurred. It is reported that the manager of the shop is Chen Guoliang from Shaoxing, and the business has been doing well. A month ago, the shop received several warning letters.</p>
<h3>County Land Survey Fee Verified and Collected</h3>
<p>Cancellation of Rounding Up Original Proposal</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government and the Finance Bureau jointly issued an announcement yesterday stating: It has been ordered by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance and Department of Civil Affairs: Regarding the collection of land survey fees in various counties, the fee of one jiao per mu will be collected, and those who have less than one mu will be charged as if they had one mu, and receipts will be issued separately. This was implemented in Jiangning and Zhenjiang Counties in the 18th year of the Republic of China when the land survey fee was first collected, and the method was decided by the former Land Consolidation Committee and drafted by the Provincial Department of Finance and issued separately for compliance. Now, citizens such as Sheng Yuanyin, Wang Tinggan, and Wu Weihe of Songjiang County have telegraphed to request that the land survey fee be collected based on the existing practice of verifying the amount. After the two provincial departments reviewed the matter and received a reply from the Provincial Land Bureau, they agreed that the method of charging less than one mu as one mu had many drawbacks and should be improved in a timely manner. The request of the citizens was approved, and the original proposal to round up to the nearest mu was canceled. From this year onward, in addition to those already collected, the land survey fee in each county should be verified and collected based on past practices. For example, if the fee is 1 jiao and 1 fen per mu, then the fee for 1 mu and 1 fen should be 1 jiao and 1 fen, and so on, to ensure fairness and prevent abuse. In addition to the order and report to the Provincial Government for filing, the County Magistrate is ordered to comply and instruct the Finance Bureau to comply. At the same time, a joint announcement will be made to inform all. The County Magistrate must submit a report on the implementation to the Provincial Departments. Therefore, it is hereby announced that the land survey fees in this county have been discussed and resolved at the 119th County Government Meeting to be collected from this year onward. In addition to the fact that the fees for the second phase of the land price tax will be verified and calculated, it is hereby announced to inform all residents of the county.</p>
<h3>Songhu Rehabilitation Association Forms River Dredging Association</h3>

<h3>Various Regions Beg for Relief from the Three Provinces Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Charity Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei is currently organizing a disaster area inspection team to visit the three provinces for on-site inspections. Zhang Fang, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Relief Association, telegraphed Shanghai yesterday to welcome the inspection. The following is a summary of the association's important news yesterday:</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Fang Welcomes Inspection</p>
<p>Zhang Boyingwen, Chairman of the Jiangnan Provincial Relief Association, telegraphed on the 12th, stating that the people in southern Henan were in dire straits due to the disaster. He asked when the inspection team would be departing and requested notification so that they could be welcomed.</p>
<p>▲ Wu Zhongxin Begs for Relief in a Letter</p>
<p>Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, sent a letter stating that the Taihu bandit disaster relief representative telegraphed that the area north of Taihu, reaching Yinghuo to the west, had been invaded by Red Bandits last autumn, killing and kidnapping thousands of people, and looting all clothes and food. The surviving people had suffered again and had no means of livelihood. It was requested that urgent relief be provided quickly and that the Shanghai and Beijing charity organizations be telegraphed for relief. The province has suffered repeated disasters over a wide area, and the people have been scattered, the markets are in decline, and relief is urgently needed. However, the province's finances are exhausted, and there is no money to allocate. The previous telegram is enclosed for reference, and it is requested that funds be allocated to provide relief so that the surviving people can celebrate rebirth.</p>
<p>▲ Hua Yang Charity Relief Association Sends Letter</p>
<p>The Anhui Hua Yang Charity Relief Association sent a letter stating that the Taihu Bandit Disaster Relief Committee telegraphed to request relief for the situation in Taihu. In addition to replying and appealing on their behalf, this letter is sent for reference.</p>
<p>▲ Request Fellow Anhui Provincials to Inspect</p>
<p>The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Shanghai Temporary Charity Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, stating that the Chinese Red Cross Society Susong Branch telegraphed to report a serious bandit disaster and requested urgent relief. The association is sending this letter for reference and hopes that you will provide as much relief as possible. The association has replied to the fellow Anhui provincials, who are currently organizing an inspection team, asking them to join them in inspecting the disaster area and then providing relief.</p>
<h3>Fuyang County Suffers Banditry, Begs for Relief</h3>
<p>Yu Bandit Li Chenggong and Others Run Rampant</p>
<p>The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association and the Fuyang County Fellow-Provincials Association recently received telegrams from the county relief branch, various organizations, and legal groups, stating that Fuyang has suffered successive water and drought disasters, and the people are deeply impoverished. Unexpectedly, Yu Bandit Li Chenggong's group and Zhang Si's and Zhao Hongshan's groups, each numbering several thousand, have recently invaded the county, burning, killing, raping, and looting. The villages they pass through are left in ruins. In the tenth district alone, more than fifty villages have been destroyed, and corpses are everywhere. At least 250,000 people are left alive or have escaped after being abducted and have no home to return to. The suffering is unbearable to describe. Now that severe winter is approaching, they are exposed to the wind and sleep in the open, and people are dying every day. Local finances are exhausted, and there is no way to remedy the situation. We hope that various relief organizations, charity groups, and philanthropists will quickly provide clothing and food to provide relief and protect these survivors from filling ditches. The words are almost written in blood and tears. It is reported that the provincial association and the Fuyang County Shanghai Student Association are preparing to request relief from various charity organizations or to raise cotton clothing, food, and cash to be sent directly to the county relief branch for immediate distribution.</p>
<h3>Anhui People Unanimously Oppose the Rice Surtax</h3>
<p>The Anhui Native Association in Shanghai and the Anhui Students Association in Shanghai Reiterate Their Telegram to Wu Zhongxin Questioning the Disastrous and Oppressive Rice Surtax in Anhui. Respected Mr. Wu Zhongxin of Anqing: Your esteemed telegram has been received. The illegal and oppressive rice surtax has been met with fervent opposition from Anhui people everywhere. Public opinion is clearly against it. Instead of acceding to popular sentiment by removing and punishing Jiang and Ye, you have resolutely dismantled the Grain Administration, only to then expand its organization, establish numerous branch bureaus and inspection stations, setting up a dense network of taxation, exhausting the resources of the people. This is still not enough, as you have decided to issue a massive road construction bond of five million yuan, secured by the rice surtax revenue. The people, already on the verge of death, are being bled dry. How can you bear to exploit them repeatedly? The people of Anhui bear no grudge against you. Why are you so swayed by sycophants, determined to inflict such extreme harm on Anhui? The fellow villagers in Shanghai deeply resent this. Therefore, a joint conference of all sectors was held on the [Eastern] Day, unanimously vowing to fight to the death. In addition to the representatives Liu Zhujing, Ling Shuqiao, Xu Zhiyuan, Dai Gaowu, Fan Zhenbang, Fang Chen, Xu Huanran, and other comrades who left for the province today to petition, we are sending this telegram as a final appeal. We earnestly hope that you will act decisively, abolish the Rice Surtax Bureau and all its personnel, eliminate this institution, and halt the issuance of public bonds. Then, the provincial administration will be renewed, criticism will cease, and public support will be no less than when you first took office. This urgent plea is respectfully submitted for your understanding. The Anhui Native Association in Shanghai and the Anhui Students Association in Shanghai respectfully kowtow. Attached is the Second Notice of the Meeting to Discuss the Rice Surtax: Respected Sirs, This is to inform you that reports have arrived in Shanghai regarding the situation of the delegation petitioning against the rice surtax in various places. All matters relating to this issue urgently need further discussion. It is hereby scheduled that the Second General Meeting of all sectors of Anhui natives in Shanghai to oppose the rice surtax will be held at 2:00 PM on the 13th of this month (i.e., Sunday) at the Native Association in Pu Bai Fang, Rue Luban, to jointly deliberate for further action. The Anhui Native Association in Shanghai and the Anhui Students Association in Shanghai jointly announce.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Anhui Students Association in Beijing Appeals Against Oppressive Levies and Ruthless Exactions: All citizens inside and outside Anhui province, take note! Dispatches report the Anhui authorities’ rampant levies and ruthless exactions, causing widespread outcry. In addition to sending telegrams to Wu and Ye, demanding the immediate cancellation of all kinds of oppressive levies, this association earnestly solicits unanimous support. This is our hope and prayer. The original telegrams are appended below: (1) Telegram to Chairman Wu: Respected Chairman Wu of the Anhui Provincial Government, the people of Anhui have high hopes for your administration. However, the recent establishment of the Grain Administration, the public sale of opium, and the unauthorized issuance of road construction bonds worth five million yuan are harsh policies that harm the people and ruin the country, policies more ferocious than tigers. You are a wise man; we hope you will swiftly retract your orders and not become a continuation of the Chen [Diaoyuan] regime. The Anhui Students Association in Beijing [Gray]. (2) Telegram to Director Ye of the Finance Department: Respected Mr. Ye Yuanlong of the Anhui Finance Department, in recent years, our unfortunate Anhui has suffered repeated disasters, leaving homes devastated and the people impoverished. Yet the provincial authorities have boldly established the Grain Administration, levying a rice surtax, a heavy plunder of six jiao per dan, draining the pond to catch all the fish. How can the people’s lives bear this? Despite clear orders from the Ministry of Finance to abolish it, they brazenly disregard them. At the same time, they have boldly issued road construction bonds worth five million yuan and dispatched Commissioners Yang Youxin and Song Shaobai to Wuhu to publicly sell opium, following in the footsteps of Chen [Diaoyuan], bringing disaster to Anhui. They are severely exploiting the people, substituting violence for violence, leaving the people with no hope. Commentators believe that Mr. Ye, as a scholar who abandoned teaching for wealth, intends to test his methods of exploitation. Mr. Wu is an honest and upright man who, as a supervisory commissioner, vigorously criticized Chen Diaoyuan's rice surtax case. How could he now act hypocritically in this way? Everyone believes that this is Mr. Ye's idea. Mr. Ye, what have you learned from reading the books of sages and worthies? This association distinguishes between worthies and villains in Chen and Mr. Ye, without any regional bias. If you do not rein in your actions and cease your oppression, this association will take the most severe measures to deal with you directly. If you believe otherwise, please wait and see. The Anhui Students Association in Beijing [Gray].</p>
<h3>Quan Shaowu Arrives in Shanghai Awaiting Trial</h3>
<p>Yang Shucheng Also Arrives</p>
<p>Quan Shaowu, the commissioner for disaster relief in northern Anhui, is being sued by the Anhui Native Association in Shanghai for his disaster relief duties. Mr. Quan arrived in Shanghai from Anhui the night before last (the 13th) to await trial. Because there have been rumors that the defendant was avoiding appearing in court, he came specifically to clarify the matter and has hired lawyer Zhang Shizhao to defend him. Also arriving in Shanghai at the same time was Yang Shucheng, the transportation commissioner who is a co-defendant in the case. Yesterday, he hired lawyer Wang Yiping to defend him. Wang Fanwu, a staff member of the Bengbu Grain Station, will also arrive in Shanghai within five days. The court has not yet set a date for the continuation of the trial.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attaché Tadashi Returns to Shanghai from Hankou</h3>
<p>Reportedly, the Anti-Japanese Movement in Hankou Has Halted</p>
<p>The Shen Shi Telegraphic News Agency reports: Major General Tadashi, the Japanese military attaché to China, went to inspect the Yangtze River coast in October. Now that his mission is complete, he returned to Shanghai on the Fengyang Maru the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, Tadashi hosted a banquet at the Japanese military attaché's office on Wuding Road for important officers of the Third Fleet and the Marines, reporting on the recent situation along the Yangtze River coast. According to Tadashi's report to Japanese reporters on his inspection, the anti-Japanese movement in Hankou has completely halted, and Japanese goods have regained their former position in the Yangtze River area.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Will Expand the Municipal Ferry</h3>
<p>Adding One Large Ferry and Three Small Ferries</p>
<p>Opening a New Line from Wusong to the 16th Pier</p>
<p>The Municipal Ferry, run by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, has not only provided great convenience to the citizens, but the bureau has also created the most complete and modern ferry at the lowest cost, which has been praised by both Chinese and foreigners. The bureau currently has four large ferries and three small ferries, but due to overcrowding, they are not sufficient to meet demand. Therefore, it is now planned to add one large ferry and three small ferries. As soon as this is approved by this week's municipal meeting, work can begin. According to Director Huang of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the three small ferries to be added are for use on cross-river routes. They can travel in both directions because the river surface is narrow, and there are many boats. Turning the ferry around is both troublesome and dangerous. The small ferry that travels in both directions not only eliminates the need to turn around, saving time, but also eliminates danger. The large ferry to be added is for use on the new route from Wusong Town to the 16th Pier. It is very troublesome for merchants in Wusong to go to the 16th Pier to purchase goods. If the new route from Wusong Town to the 16th Pier is opened, it will be much more convenient. In addition, all ferries purchased will use diesel engines, so passengers can avoid the discomfort of coal ash blowing in their faces.</p>
<h3>Dollar and American Mail Steamship Companies</h3>
<p>Shorten the Sino-American Voyage by One Day</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao [North China Daily News] reports that the San Francisco liners of the Dollar Steamship Company and the American Mail Steamship Company will now shorten the voyage by one day, reducing the journey from Shanghai to San Francisco to seventeen days. This will begin with the Grant President liner on the 10th of next month. Thereafter, the departure date of the San Francisco liners from Shanghai will also be changed from Friday to Saturday. Furthermore, the round-the-world liners of the two companies coming to Shanghai from San Francisco can also depart from Shanghai one day earlier, starting with the Sea Zang Shi President liner on the 22nd of this month. Thereafter, the departure date will be changed to Tuesday, heading to Europe for export.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Municipal Cooperation Promotion Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Cooperation Promotion Association held its inaugural meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday on the third floor of the Municipal Party Headquarters. More than 50 members, as well as Yu Zhongbiao, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Hang Dingan, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, attended to provide guidance. The meeting elected a presidium consisting of Wei Yi, Li Shiyong, and Shi Jin. Zhu Chaoran served as the recorder. The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Chen Fan, who reported on the preparatory work. The meeting then proceeded to discuss and pass the articles of association and elect executive and supervisory committee members. As a result, Chen Weifan, Li Shiyong, Zhu Chaoran, Shi Jin, and Wang Longzhang were elected as executive committee members, while Chen Zimi and Du Mengsen were elected as alternate executive committee members. Du Gang, Lin Meiyan, and Chen Wei Yi were elected as supervisory committee members, while Liao Zhaojun was elected as an alternate supervisory committee member. After the election, a photograph was taken, and the meeting continued to discuss various proposals. It was resolved to hand these over to the executive committee for handling. A declaration of establishment was issued, and Li Shiyong and others were appointed to review and revise it. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The District Court Strictly Prohibits Flower Gambling</h3>
<p>Flower gambling in this port, with its main operation located in the foreign concession, is organized by a group of hooligans including Cao, Gao, and Mao. It operates three times a day, with thousands of listening posts throughout Shanghai, and the number of errand runners dispatched from these listening posts reaches over ten thousand. The means of luring gamblers are so numerous, and the number of victimized, foolish people is staggering. The daily income is beyond calculation. In the Chinese areas of Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and Huxi, the listening posts and errand runners are also countless. Every evening, passersby stand waiting for swift horses to bring news, and the crowds are especially dense along the Road of the Republic. This phenomenon has come to the attention of the Jiangsu High Court. Cases of families being ruined, suicides, and murders caused by flower gambling are frequent, making it a great scourge of society. Therefore, the High Court has instructed the Shanghai District Court to immediately arrest and detain the worst offenders and to make every effort to suppress it in order to uphold the law. Therefore, the District Court instructed the Judicial Police Department to closely and promptly arrest and bring the offenders to justice, and to announce to the public that reports are permitted, so that the ringleaders can be investigated and punished.</p>
<h3>Appeal to the Supreme Court in the Russian Beggar Case</h3>
<p>In the case of Russian beggar Georgiy Laty Love, who died of illness in the Second Special District District Court detention center on June 19 of this year, his brother, Simon Gray Techy, reported to the French Concession Police Department that the warden of the detention center, Xu Chongwen, the medical officer of the detention center, Yu Ming Gao, and the cell guard, Zhou Zongxiang, were being prosecuted by the Second Special District District Court for abandonment and injury resulting in death. After a trial was held, and the Shanghai-renowned English and French medical officers were invited to re-examine the corpse with the forensic doctor of this court, the result was that he died of illness. Subsequently, the three defendants were found not guilty. The Police Department was dissatisfied with the original judgment and filed an appeal to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. When the trial was concluded, the appeal was dismissed. It has been repeatedly recorded in previous reports that the Police Department was still not convinced by the second-instance judgment and had already filed an appeal with the Supreme Court in Nanjing, the third-instance body. The High Court Third Branch has submitted the files to the higher court for review. The Police Department is now collecting the previous statements of all parties concerned to supplement the written reasons for the appeal.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cement Masquerades as National Product "Horse Brand"</h3>
<p>Domestic Cement Business Accuses Shen Tai Hang and Others</p>
<p>The Domestic Cement Business Office, located at No. 6 Sichuan Road, has always operated the "Horse Brand" cement, promoting it nationwide. Recently, the office learned that Shen Tai Brick and Tile Shop at No. 9 Weishui Lane, Ningbo Road, and the Meichang Construction Factory at No. 101 Zhili Road, Beijing Road, jointly purchased more than 120 bags of Japanese "Ship Brand" cement, changed the labels to "Horse Brand", and transported them into the factory in the hope of avoiding inspection and obtaining huge profits. Therefore, the lawyer was retained to accuse Jia Jisheng, the owner of Shen Tai Brick and Tile Shop, and his councillor, Wu Wenyue, and Xu Qingxiang, the manager of Meichang Construction Factory, of the crime of hindering agriculture, industry, and commerce. The judge Huang Risheng of the Ninth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court of Shanghai summoned them to court in the afternoon. Wang An, the representative of the Domestic Cement Business Office, testified that the cement operated by his office had three trademarks: "Horse Brand," "Elephant Brand," and "Taishan Brand," with "Horse Brand" being the most well-known nationwide. The defendants colluded on the 12th of last month to purchase more than 120 bags of Japanese "Ship Brand" cement, falsely labeled them with the "Horse Brand" trademark, and transported them from the Huishan Wharf to the Meichang Construction Factory to prevent inspection. His office learned of this and immediately sent someone to report to the Huishan Patrol Station. The patrol station then sent Chinese and Western detectives to the Meichang Construction Factory to investigate and found many bags of cement falsely labeled with the "Horse Brand" trademark. The Chinese and Western detectives took the defendant Wu Wenyue to the patrol station. The patrol station said that this case was a private prosecution, so it allowed Wu Wenyue to be released on bail. Therefore, he specially retained a lawyer to sue the defendants. Subsequently, Hua Tan Wang Xiangpo of the Huishan Patrol Station reported that on the 12th of last month at about 12:00 PM, Chen Zhaoxiong and others from the Domestic Cement Business Office reported to the patrol station that Xu Qingxiang, who was running the Meichang Construction Factory, had a lot of cement falsely labeled with the "Horse Brand" of the Domestic Cement Business Office. The patrol chief sent him and Western Detective Huaxun No. 309 to investigate. They found that more than ten bags of cement were labeled with the "Horse Brand" trademark. According to the reporter, this kind of cement was not operated by the Domestic Cement Business Office. Not long after, a man named Wu Wenyue arrived. The defendant Xu Qingxiang said that this cement was transported by Wu. Therefore, they immediately detained Wu. Wu Wenyue said that he was an associate of Jia Jisheng, the owner of the first defendant, Shen Tai Brick and Tile Shop, and said that because Japanese "Ship Brand" cement was now prohibited, falsely labeling it with the "Horse Brand" of the Domestic Cement Business Office could avoid inspection. At that time, he and the Western detective brought Wu into the patrol station. Judge Huang severely interrogated the defendant Jia Jisheng, who testified that there was no Wu Wenyue in his shop, and that he knew nothing about the accusations made by the plaintiff. Xu Qingxiang testified that on the 12th of last month, a man named Wu Wenyue transported more than 30 bags of "Horse Brand" cement. His factory was temporarily short of cement, so he accepted it. Later, he learned that it was Japanese goods masquerading as domestic goods and negotiated with Wu to return it. Wu then drove it away. He originally purchased the goods with money. The plaintiff accused him of colluding, which was a false accusation. He requested to be vindicated. Judge Huang then adjourned the hearing and ordered it to be rescheduled to summon Wu Wenyue, the second defendant, who had not yet arrived, and to summon the witness, Western Detective Huaxun No. 309 of the Huishan Patrol Station, to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>The Western Clothing Industry Association</h3>
<p>Promotes Domestic Woolen Fabrics</p>
<p>The Shanghai Western Clothing Industry Association, in view of the fact that woolen fabrics are the raw materials needed by the industry, especially imported woolen fabrics which flood the market and cause a great outflow of profits every year, recently heard that the association, based on the resolution of the Fourth Members' Representative Conference, intends to actively promote domestic woolen fabrics to stop the leakage of wealth. They specially sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, saying: "Respected Sirs, Woolen fabrics have a wide range of uses, but they are mostly needed for making clothes, especially coats, uniforms, and Western-style clothes, etc., which are mostly made of woolen fabrics. Our association is aware that imported goods flood the market and cause a great outflow of profits. In addition to informing members at any time to encourage customers to use domestic woolen fabrics as raw materials for making Western clothes, we intend to actively promote domestic woolen fabrics to stop the leakage of wealth. It has been resolved by the Fourth Members' Representative Conference to send samples to the association from various domestic woolen fabric factories so that we can introduce them for adoption, etc., which is recorded in the case file. We have long known that your association leads the merchants and can devote itself to promoting domestic goods. We hereby send a letter to request that you inform various domestic woolen fabric factories in the area of this city to send fine samples, indicating the type and price, to the association so that they can be introduced and promoted, which is indeed a matter of public interest." Sincerely, The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>The Sentry, a Chinese Constable, Secretly Sells Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Detention Unsuccessful, Surrenders Himself</p>
<p>After Interrogation, He is Still Detained Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Sun Yulin, a native of Haizhou, was arrested by Chinese Detective Sun Anwen on Huasheng Road at about 9:00 PM on September 12 for carrying a handgun and 99 bullets. He was taken to the Yulin Road Patrol Station and confessed to purchasing the handgun and bullets from his friend, Hua Zhenpu, a native of Tianjin. He was sentenced to two years and six months in prison and sent to prison. Subsequently, the patrol station sent detectives to arrest Hua, but they were unsuccessful. Hua suddenly surrendered to the patrol station with Lawyer Fan Gang and was sent to the court for trial. The attorney for the patrol station, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the defendant had fled after Sun Yulin was detained and then surrendered when he knew he could not escape the law. Sun Yulin was brought to court to testify and stated that he asked the defendant to buy a handgun for self-defense because he had enemies who were plotting against him. He said that he turned to a sailor from Ningbo on a certain ship. He then handed him a handgun and one hundred bullets and taught him how to shoot. So one bullet was missing. The total price was 60 yuan, and he also gave him a reward of 5 yuan. The defendant confessed that he was a sentry at a certain dock. Sun was a foreman of a sand and gravel gang and asked him to buy a handgun for him. He said that he was an office worker and could not buy it for him, so he told him to find a way to buy it himself. Lawyer Fan defended him. Judge Zhao Linyu ordered Hua Zhenpu to be detained and set a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Bold and Reckless</h3>
<p>Gu Weiping's Fraud Exposed</p>
<p>Impersonating a Lawyer's Assistant</p>
<p>Forging Official Government Commissions</p>
<p>Gu Weiping, a native of Nanhui, who impersonated a lawyer's assistant, lived at No. 55 Shengjia Lane in the city. The writing room in his home was quite luxurious. He went out in his own chartered car, pretending to be a lawyer. Recently, he fantasized and claimed to be the director of the Fourth Branch of the Songhu Fishery Tax Bureau, recruiting employees, including Zheng Yisheng, who was a detective in the county government, his brother Zheng Pinggui, and boatmen Tong Liude and Zhou Qiankun, all of whom were commissioned by Gu Weiping. Unexpectedly, after being commissioned, none of them reported to work. They repeatedly urged Gu Weiping, but he kept prevaricating. So Zheng Pinggui told his brother, but he did not know whether it was false or true. Therefore, he submitted a request to the Fishery Tax Bureau to order the Fourth Branch to give them work. The Bureau approved that there was no Fourth Branch established and that Gu Weiping had forged the commission and defrauded them of money. Zheng Pinggui, Tong Liude, and Zhou Qiankun all spent huge sums of money to seek the position. Yesterday, Zheng and others went to Gu Weiping's residence to demand the position, otherwise they would return the money. Therefore, a dispute arose. Patrol Officer Tian Yugui arrested Gu Weiping and brought him to the Second Precinct of the First District for investigation. After questioning by Director Xu, it was found that Gu Weiping had indeed forged the commission and defrauded them of money. Six forged commissions and a written reply were seized and sent to the Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Suffocating a Woman and Performing a Great Coffin Splitting</h3>
<p>The Black Dog Mistaken for a Yellow Dog</p>
<p>The case of a woman suffocated in the attic of the second landlord, Lu Hou, a native of Nanjing, at No. 13 Shude Lane, Xujiahui Town, Huxi, has been reported in detail in previous reports. After the local security officer reported the case to the court for an autopsy, it was found that there were no family members. He was ordered to temporarily place her in a temple. Unexpectedly, it was discovered by a group of flower gambling enthusiasts who went to the altar that night to seek dreams. Dozens of people went to the altar, and in the middle of the night, they dreamed of her transformed into a yellow dog. The next day, they all went to the flower gambling listening posts in the nearby Haige Lane and Xiaoyou Lane and publicly bet on the yellow dog as a long shot. Unexpectedly, things went against their wishes, and the character that came out was actually a black dog, leading to their defeat. Everyone became angry at the wronged ghost and, the night before last, used an axe to split open the coffin, stripped off the clothes of the corpse, and abandoned it outside the coffin. The quilt and bedding were all stolen. It was not until noon yesterday that someone discovered it and reported it to the local security officer, who ordered it to be buried on behalf of the family.</p>
<h3>The Great China Science Research Society</h3>
<p>Visited the Chinese Chemical Industry Society Yesterday</p>
<p>The Great China Science Research Society was established in 1925 as the only organization promoting popular science. It was initially led by Wu Zhihui and successively edited the "Science Weekly" of the Beijing Jingbao and the Shanghai Republic Daily. It was suspended for some reason. This year, it was revived by some members, and the "Science World" was appended to the Chen Bao in this port, which was quite popular with the society. Recently, it has been divided into groups according to the nature of the subjects and is preparing to set up a small-scale "Science Library" and laboratory in Shanghai, and has found more than 200 acres of farmland in the Jinshu of Zhejiang Province, which is planned to be used for agricultural testing. A few days ago, Ling, a member of the society, went to negotiate. Yesterday, more than 40 ordinary members of the society in this port, together with Xu Zhi of the society, visited the Chinese Chemical Industry Society on Binlang Road. Hong and Sun of the factory hosted and accompanied them on a tour of the factory for three hours. Detailed opinions will be published in the next issue of "Science World." The "Winter Supplies," "Tonics," and "Radio" special issues of this publication are especially valuable. The society is widely recruiting members. Anyone who wishes to join is welcome, regardless of qualifications or gender, and can send a letter to the society or the Chen Bao in this port for forwarding.</p>
<h3>Xi Zhuting Missing</h3>
<p>Xi Shengtin, a native of Jingjiang, sold miscellaneous goods to various cargo transport companies. This time, the goods he transported were sold at a loss due to poor market conditions. Last month, he and a friend jointly sold wheat and medicinal materials to Shanghai. The price fell daily, and Xi refused to sell at a loss. The friend was eager to sell, and a dispute arose. The goods were left until the ninth of this month before they were sold. The amount lost was more than 1,000 yuan. He questioned Xi, who had sold them at a very small loss at the time, causing the quarrel to start again. Unexpectedly, Xi and his friend took a boat back to Pudong the day before yesterday. Suddenly, Xi disappeared at the dock. His friend searched everywhere but could not find him. Fearing an accident, he asked a colleague to report to the authorities for investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhu Songpu's Remnant Concubine Appeals the Disinheritance by His Son</h3>
<p>When Zhu Songpu, a prominent figure in the financial industry, was alive, he took a woman from Suzhou named You as his concubine, bearing two daughters, Jinlin and Jinrong, who are now both adults. In the ninth year of the Republic (1920), Songpu suddenly suffered a severe illness that was unresponsive to medicine. You, behind everyone's back, cut flesh from her thigh to cure her husband. This act was known to Songpu, who then provided a deposit of five thousand yuan in the name of "Liangxin Ji" (Good Conscience Account) to commend her foolish sincerity. After Songpu passed away from illness, he left behind assets of hundreds of thousands, all managed by his嫡 son, Zhu Bohua. Each month, only twenty-four yuan was given to You as room expenses. In these times of high prices, how could this paltry sum of twenty-four yuan be sufficient for daily use? Reluctantly, they had to use the five thousand yuan from the Liangxin Ji account to raise the two daughters. Over the years, the five thousand yuan has been almost completely depleted. The year before last, when Jinlin married into the Song family, Bohua, after You repeatedly requested, finally provided six thousand yuan in 洋 as dowry expenses. After the January 28th Incident this year (1932), Bohua, using various excuses, stopped paying the monthly twenty-four yuan room expenses, causing hardship for Zhu You and Zhu Jinrong, mother and daughter. They then hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Zhu Bohua of abandonment under Article 310 of the Criminal Law. During the trial, Zhu Bohua argued that, in addition to the five thousand yuan given to You under the Liangxin Ji account, his late father had also provided twenty thousand yuan in cash. This money was deposited in various commercial firms, which have since gone bankrupt, making it impossible to verify the accounts. Furthermore, he had given six thousand yuan the year before last as severance money. The monthly room expenses were not unpaid by him but rather that she didn't come to get them. He also presented witnesses, Songpu's younger brothers Liansheng and Chunsheng, to testify that they knew for certain that Songpu had given You twenty thousand yuan in addition to the five thousand yuan during his lifetime. You also presented her elder uncle, Xingsheng, to testify that there was no such money. The court then ruled Zhu Bohua not guilty, and the related civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial. You, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired three lawyers, Zhan Jifeng, Qin Liankui, and Yao Zhaoli, to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Their reasoning included: ㈠ The six thousand yuan for the eldest daughter's marriage in the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930) was clearly for her dowry, as her elder uncle Xingsheng can testify. The defendant presented a document claiming severance and a receipt for six thousand yuan, but the appellant did not sign it, and the handwriting can be authenticated. ㈡ The defendant claimed that the appellant had twenty thousand yuan in addition to the five thousand yuan from the Liangxin Ji account, but the source of this money was never explained. When questioned about where it was deposited, he replied with the names of bankrupt firms for which no records could be found. Moreover, Zhu Xingsheng testified that it would be difficult for the defendant if he did not support the appellant's livelihood, so the claim of twenty thousand yuan is entirely unbelievable. They also cited legal reasons totaling over a thousand words, requesting the revocation of the original verdict and the imposition of the appropriate punishment under Article 310 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, the presiding judge of the Second Branch of the High Court's Criminal Division, Yu Hua, along with magistrates Lu and Zhao, opened the court and summoned the defendant Zhu Bohua, who was represented by lawyer Lin Yingqing. Judge Yu adjourned the hearing and ordered another summons.</p>

<h3>The Popularity of German "Lion Strength" Brand Beef and Chicken Essence</h3>
<p>In recent years, many new brands of beef and chicken essence have appeared on the market, with a dazzling array of colors and names that are often similar, leading to confusion. In reality, only the "Lion Strength" brand beef and chicken essence, manufactured by the German Marta Pharmaceutical Factory using a cold-pressing method, is truly of German origin and has significant efficacy. "Lion Strength" brand beef and chicken essence has been sold in China for a long time, functioning to enhance essence, replenish blood, stimulate appetite, and strengthen the mind, making it a reliable tonic for regular consumption. However, buyers must pay attention: any product with only the word "Lion" is not the genuine product, and any product with only the word "Strength" is also not the genuine product. Be sure to recognize the three connected characters of "Lion Strength"　 as the truly German-made product. It is sold in major companies and pharmacies in this port.</p>

<h3>A Local Prostitute Meets a Gigolo</h3>
<p>What face does Xiang Bin have to see Fan Aliuer?</p>
<p>Fan Aliuer, a local Hangzhou prostitute of nineteen years with considerable charm, met Xiang Bin, who resided at No. 21 Jialu Road in Shanghai, during a trip to Hangzhou. Xiang was indeed a gigolo. During his stay in Hangzhou, he met Fan Aliuer. Fan saw Xiang as a handsome young man, and eagerly invited him to stay overnight. Xiang used sweet words to deceive Fan Aliuer, winning her heart. However, Xiang Bin had no money on him. Even the inn expenses were not available, so he lied to Fan, saying that his wallet had been stolen on the train, leaving him penniless. Therefore, all expenses were paid by Fan. Xiang also invited Fan Aliuer to Shanghai, promising to repay her and make new clothes for her. Fan believed him and came to Shanghai with him, temporarily lodging at the Xinxin Hotel on French Avenue. Later, Xiang told Fan Aliuer that he needed to take her old clothes to measure for the new ones. Fan did not suspect anything and gave him several items, including a silk-lined qipao. However, Xiang Bin never returned. Until yesterday afternoon, Fan met Xiang Bin in the county, asking him where the clothes were. Xiang claimed that he had pawned them. Only then did Fan Aliuer realize she had been deceived, and she cried loudly. Zhang Xuezhi from the Twenty-Four Gang arrived and arrested them both, taking them to the Second Precinct of the First District for investigation. The head of the precinct, Xu, interrogated Xiang Bin for deceiving and abducting Fan Aliuer to Shanghai, and for pawning her clothes. The case involves fraudulent acquisition of property and has been handed over to the Public Security Bureau for legal action.</p>

<h3>National Products Harmonica Grand Sale</h3>
<p>The Datong Music Association on Songshan Road in the French Concession, in order to promote national products, has imitated the manufacture of Harmonica and Round Glilee products, which have been individually tested by experts and are becoming increasingly refined, and are very popular in society. The bottom of these products is hand-carved from the original board, which is much more labor-intensive than being machine-pressed, and can permanently avoid problems such as degumming and plate running. The original price was 20 yuan each for the Harmonica and 10 yuan for the Round Glilee. Recently, the association, in order to further promote the products, will sell them at a 30% discount off the list price until the end of the Gregorian calendar year: 14 yuan for the Harmonica (including bow) and 7 yuan for the Round Glilee (including strings), which are being sold by Xiangxing Piano Shop on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. In addition, there is also a North Song ancient wood Harmonica, which is particularly antique in color and sound, and has a unique charm that will surely be treasured by the world in the future. The list price is 100 yuan, but it is now also sold at a 30% discount. However, the raw materials are scarce and the manufacturing is difficult, so there are few products. The association does not set out to sell them.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>On the 11th of this month, Tingzi奉部令 went to Shanghai to urge Mr. Liu Hongsheng, the new Director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to take over the company as soon as possible, and to investigate the company's loan matters.

Secretary-General Liu brought the various contracts signed with foreign companies to the Ministry. The news about the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company published in your newspaper on the 13th of this month, regarding Tingzi's meeting with General Manager Li, does not conform to the facts and should be corrected. Please investigate and handle this matter.</p>

<h3>Report of Judge Feitham on the Situation of the Shanghai International Settlement Volume IV (22)</h3>
<p>32. A third method might suitably be adopted in conjunction with the first or second, in order that officers of the Council who have fulfilled the conditions requisite to qualify for a minimum pension under the existing Rules, and whom the Council considers it desirable to pension according to length of service, may be so treated, without it being necessary to make the officer fit, in other respects, the special conditions proposed to be applicable to officers upon the permanent list.</p>
<p>33. Any amendment of the Pension Rules should contain careful restrictions in its conditions, so as not to encourage officers to retire early in order to qualify for a proportionate pension according to length of service. I think that the payment of such a pension should be limited to the two following classes of cases:</p>
<p>(a) Where an officer has served for a certain definite number of years, and is compelled to retire, without misconduct on his part, or</p>
<p>(b) Where an officer voluntarily retires on account of a substantial change in the conditions of his service which is prejudicial to him.</p>
<p>34. The various provisions of Pension Rules proposed above cannot wholly achieve all that is required. The pension interests of the officers concerned will, indeed, be protected thereby, but security of tenure will be affected only to a limited extent indirectly.</p>
<p>G. The Proposed Municipal Service Committee</p>
<p>35. With reference to the proposed Municipal Service Committee, it must again be stated that the original intention in proposing such a Committee was that it should be a judicial body to deal with questions which may arise between the Council and any officer upon the permanent list under the terms of the proposed new terms of service; but that it might conveniently be entrusted with the same kind of questions affecting certain other grades of officers; for example, a Rule might be made that the question of dismissing for misconduct any officer above a certain grade should be submitted to the decision of the Committee, and a clause might be added to the terms of service accepted by the officer stating that the decision of the Committee upon such question should be regarded as final and binding both upon the Council and the officer concerned.</p>
<p>36. There is, further, the question to which reference is made above of the provision in the Retiring Fund Rules, by virtue of which, in a case where an officer of three or more years’ service is dismissed by the Council or gives notice himself, the Council has a wide discretionary power as to whether he shall receive the whole of his retiring fund benefit or not. I think that an officer’s right to this benefit on retirement should be placed upon a more certain basis. I would suggest that where the Council is not prepared to admit the officer’s claim to this benefit, the officer might refer the question to the decision of the Committee, or to some person deputed by the Committee to investigate the matter. The decision so obtained should be final and binding both on the Council and the officer.</p>
<p>H. A Provision as to Arbitration</p>
<p>37. There is one further point, having a special relation to the position of the foreign officers, to which I think it desirable to make reference, namely, the opinion expressed in that part of this Report which is in effect that a period of transition should occur before the policy of replacing foreign officers in the higher positions by Chinese officers is carried out (Note 11). It is important that, during this period, the Council should still be able to attract and retain an adequate number of well-qualified foreign officers, and the urgent reforms proposed may cause a feeling of uncertainty and insecurity which will sooner or later make it difficult to attract and retain such officers. It has been suggested above that officers of a certain grade or above should be placed upon the permanent list after a suitable period of probation. It is worthy of consideration whether this suggestion should be supplemented by inserting in the terms of service a provision calculated to maintain and increase confidence. What I desire to put forward for consideration is whether it is desirable to insert in the terms of service a clause as to arbitration worded so as to cover any dispute which may arise between the Council and its individual officers. Under the existing Rules, any officer who desires to enforce a claim against the Council which the Council does not admit can only appeal to the Consular Court against the Council, but it is doubtful how long the Consular Courts will continue to exercise their present jurisdiction, and what will be the nature of the tribunal which will eventually rise to take its place. I have made certain suggestions on this subject in an earlier part of this Report (Note 12), but a long time must elapse before this question is finally solved. The present uncertainty of officers as to the future has an unsettling influence, and tends to diminish confidence. I therefore suggest that it would be an appropriate measure to insert in the contract made between the Council and its foreign officers a provision that any dispute arising out of the contract of service should be referred to arbitration.</p>
<p>38. Suggestions have been made above as to the establishment of a Municipal Service Committee, and as to the functions which that Committee should exercise, and, if these suggestions are adopted, the area of dispute which can arise, at all events so far as permanent officers are concerned, will be largely covered. That is to say, any question concerning the exercise by the Council of its power to dismiss a permanent officer for misconduct must be subject to the binding decision of the Committee, and it seems simplest, therefore, to adopt a provision that all disputes that may arise between the Council and any of its foreign officers shall be arbitrated upon by the Municipal Service Committee; but there are two objections which may be urged to the adoption of this method:(1) It might appear to overload the Committee, and (2) The Committee is too large a body to be conveniently summoned for the determination of every kind of dispute. I am, therefore, of opinion that it would be better to adopt a provision that, in all questions which arise between the Council and any of its foreign officers which, according to the rules or bye-laws of the Council, are not to be submitted to the Municipal Service Committee, shall be referred to three arbitrators, one to be appointed by the Council, one to be appointed by the Consul of the officer concerned, and the third to be appointed by the two arbitrators so appointed, and that if they cannot agree upon the appointment of the third arbitrator he shall be appointed by the Municipal Service Committee.</p>
<p>39. The question how the award of an arbitrator against the Council shall be enforced need not, I think, be discussed. What must be assumed is that I am fully persuaded that the Council’s refusal to obey such an award may be regarded as an unlikely contingency, but if it occurs there should be some proper machinery to enforce the award.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Table 8 annexed to Volume II. of this Report shows that the foreign officers in the service of the Council, exclusive of those employed in the Police Force and the Prisons, numbered 851 on June 30, 1930. That Table shows also that the foreign officers employed in the Police Force and the Prisons numbered 1,736 on December 31, 1930, of whom 962 were Indian. As to the details of all foreign officers in all Departments of the Council, see Chap. VIII., Sect. 13, of Part II., and Appendix 6.</p>

<p>(Note 3) See Superannuation and Pension Rules, Appendix 5 to the “Terms of Service for Foreign Officers,” as adopted by the Council on April 1, 1931.</p>
<p>(Note 4) There is a special provision in regard to pensions to members of the Police Force, namely, that any member who continues to serve for twenty-five years receives a pension equal to 40 per cent, of his final salary.</p>
<p>(Note 5) See Chap. V., Sect. 20, of Part IV.</p>

III., Sect. 3, of Part IV., and Chaps. III., Sect. 20, and IV., Sect. 56, of Part V.</p>
<p>(Note 8) See Chap. I. of Part V.</p>
<p>(Note 9) See Appendix 44.</p>
<p>(Note 10) The adoption of this suggestion would prevent employees of the Council from being qualified to vote in regard to their own or their fellow employees’ positions (Chap. III., Sect. 5, of Part VII.). Employees of the Council are disqualified from becoming voters by reason of their being exempt from paying Municipal Rates.</p>

<p>Appendix 44.</p>
<p>Outline of the conditions desirable to be applied to the tenure of office and the right to pension benefits of officers who have been placed by the Council on the permanent list.</p>
<p>The objects of a Civil Service system are two-(1) to secure tenure of office for the officers and (2) to ensure that they receive certain benefits on retirement. I have attempted in this outline to suggest what points may arise when establishing a Municipal Civil Service system for the International Settlement, and how those points may suitably be met having regard to the special circumstances which have to be taken into account. I wish to say that the various suggestions which I have summarized should be referred to and considered in conjunction with the summary given in the following Appendix of the provisions regarding the security of tenure and pension rights of civil servants contained in the Public Service Act of the Union of South Africa. That Act, though designed to suit the special circumstances of South Africa, was drawn up with reference to similar systems recently established elsewhere, and may be regarded as a modern type of a civil service law enacted in a parliamentary country. This summary may be of assistance in illustrating the ordinary nature of a modern civil service system with a sound statutory basis, and in suggesting certain details for the outline of provisions proposed to be applicable to the International Settlement.

<h3>Imitating Foreigners</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>丨The Ninth of the Art of Living in the World丨</p>
<p>The term "imitating foreigners" is quite popular, but no one knows how to write the "foreign" character correctly. Is it the "yang" of silver dollars, or the "yang" of yin and yang? If it's the "yang" character, does it mean femininity expressing masculinity, or does it mean brightness and greatness? If it's the "yang" of ocean, it means full of foreign air, expressing a happy transformation. Both explanations are plausible. However, I have searched through dictionaries and etymological sources, but there is no such entry. It is probably a new term, an oversight by the compilers of etymological dictionaries. However, since it is popular in this bustling trading port, the latter explanation is more likely, hence the use of the "ocean" character.</p>
<p>Imitating foreigners also means putting on airs. The airs must be strong, so people will look up to you. The foreign imitation must be sufficient, so people will envy you. This is why imitating foreigners is a must. Low-ranking officials go to see their superiors, not seeing them today, not seeing them tomorrow, to show how important they are. If they don't do this, they can't display the prestige of important people. Doctors who imitate foreigners would rather stay at home to hold their children and play mahjong. When patients come to ask for them, they refuse to come until six or seven in the afternoon. Clerks in foreign companies and shops don't respond to the first three calls or answer the first four calls (except for car owners and modern girls). If they don't do this, they can't put on the air of being important clerks in a prestigious establishment. Being invited to dinner with someone who imitates foreigners is even more annoying. You send an invitation, and they don't come. You call them, and they don't come. If you specify that the dinner starts at noon, they refuse to arrive until one or two. Assuming they arrive, they leave after eating one or two dishes. If they don't do this, they can't show how busy they are with social engagements. In short, the principle of social engagements is to arrive late and leave early, just like calling on a popular courtesan in a brothel. This is also imitating foreigners. A young man with money earns sixteen silver dollars a month and spends fifteen dollars and ninety cents on himself to imitate foreigners.</p>
<p>There are many examples of imitating foreigners. I will only cite a few. This is originally a bad habit of our Chinese people, completely a kind of empty arrogance, completely a kind of pretense. Foreigners naturally imitate foreigners in their own countries, but they are very punctual and very polite in business. Where they imitate foreigners, they really do imitate foreigners, and where they don't imitate foreigners, they absolutely don't imitate foreigners. It's not like our country, where no matter what the matter, no matter who the person, everyone imitates foreigners, puts on airs to the extreme. It's really annoying.</p>
<p>In this bad environment, why not try to change it, break this bad environment? No. Assuming you invite someone to dinner, and you arrive on time, they will definitely laugh at you. They haven't even eaten the first course yet, so you came so early. If a doctor comes as soon as he is called, they will laugh at him, saying his business must be slow, so he is so eager. Chinese people have the worst mouths. They don't know their own faults and try to improve them. Instead, they completely destroy the good points of others, rushing to join the crowd in doing bad things. Is this why China is China?</p>

<h3>Cod Liver Oil</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Cod liver oil is known to be a nourishing food because it contains vitamins A and D, which aid in development, and easily digestible organic acids (Jecoleic and Theropic acids), so it has long been recognized as a tonic.</p>
<p>Cod liver oil is extracted from the livers of codfish, hence the name. Codfish are mostly found near the coast of Norway. After catching them, the livers are placed in water and boiled. The oil is lighter than water and floats to the surface. It is taken out, filtered to remove impurities, and pure cod liver oil is obtained.</p>
<p>All oils have a special odor, but cod liver oil's odor is the most unpleasant. As a result, odorless milk-white cod liver oil, sweet-tasting malt extract cod liver oil, nourishing egg cod liver oil, and cod liver oil capsules have emerged. Because each has its own advantages, they are sold at very high prices, but it is not difficult to make them yourself.</p>
<p>Cod liver oil sold on the market is often mixed with other oils to get a good price. It can be tested by the following methods: 1) Cod liver oil turns rose-colored with fuming nitric acid. 2) If concentrated sulfuric acid is added, it first turns purple, and then turns brown when shaken.</p>
<p>A. Milk-White Cod Liver Oil</p>
<p>This applies the properties of physics to make a white emulsion by mixing oils with gum and water. When mixed with water, it resembles milk, with no oil droplets floating on the surface and no fishy smell of cod liver oil. Moreover, emulsions are more easily absorbed by the intestines than pure oil, so the effect is greater.</p>
<p>Preparation: Take four parts of cod liver oil and one part of powdered gum arabic, mix them evenly in a mortar, add two parts of water, and grind continuously. After a few minutes, you can obtain a pure white milk-white cod liver oil. The procedure is simple and easy to implement. For large-scale manufacturing, machines are required. The Western name is Homogenizer.</p>
<p>If you need fragrance, you can mix it in as you like.</p>
<p>Principle: Gum swells immediately when it meets water and has viscosity like glue. However, it has no effect on oil, so first mix the gum with the oil, then add water all at once. The gum swells and dissolves into a viscous liquid. At the same time, grind continuously to divide the oil into extremely small droplets, surrounded by water. Because the liquid has viscosity, the oil droplets cannot coalesce, so there is no smell of cod liver oil. If it is not ground evenly, there will be an odor, and if it is left for a long time, it will still separate into two layers of water and oil. Pay attention when making it: 1) The gum must be a dry powder; the oil should not be measured in a container that has not been wiped dry after measuring water; similarly, the water should only be measured after the container for measuring oil has been dried. 2) It is better to add water all at once, so there are no lumps.</p>
<p>3) If the first time fails, the mixture of oil, gum, and water must not be discarded and can be added to a good emulsion and ground to achieve the same effect.</p>
<p>B. Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil</p>
<p>Malt extract is maltose, and its benefits are three:</p>
<p>1) It tastes sweet, and everyone likes to eat it.</p>
<p>2) It contains a yeast that can turn starch into maltose, which is easily absorbed by the human body.</p>
<p>Contains easily digestible substances such as maltose and small amounts of other sugars.</p>
<p>Chinese refined sugar has the same quality as malt extract, but it has no yeast after being baked at high temperature, losing its digestive effect.</p>
<p>The preparation method of malt extract has already been described by Mr. Lu Ziwei in this publication, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>Preparation: Mix six grams of gum arabic with twelve grams of glycerol in a mortar, add forty grams of malt extract, mix well, add fifteen grams of cod liver oil, mix well, and then add twenty grams of malt extract and fifteen grams of cod liver oil, grind until fine and even. If you need fragrance, you can add it as you like.</p>
<p>C. Egg Cod Liver Oil</p>
<p>Eggs are one of the tonics, and adding nourishing cod liver oil has a great tonic effect, but eggs are easily spoiled and cannot be preserved for a long time, which is its drawback.</p>
<p>Preparation: Similar to the principle of milk-white cod liver oil, use egg yolk instead of gum. Grind ten grams of egg yolk with one hundred</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>grams of cod liver oil in a mortar to obtain a light yellow emulsion.</p>
<p>To prevent spoilage, you can add a little bit of five percent alcohol or benzoic acid.</p>
<p>D. Cod Liver Oil Pills</p>
<p>Cod liver oil pills have no special effect, only to avoid the odor of cod liver oil.</p>
<p>Preparation: Melt pure gelatine, use a mold to make grape-like shells, add cod liver oil, and seal them to obtain them.</p>

<h3>A Joke About Punctuation</h3>
<p>— Yu Cheng</p>
<p>In the countryside, there was an illiterate man who, for some reason, had made a fortune. While he and his wife were enjoying happiness, she suddenly fell ill and died. After losing his wife, he naturally wanted to remarry, and vowed to marry a beautiful woman to enjoy the happiness of love.</p>
<p>This news reached the ears of a local rogue, who came to pay him a special visit. The rogue said, "I have a friend's younger sister who looks like an angel descended from heaven. I would like to be your matchmaker, but how much reward are you prepared to give me?"</p>
<p>The man smiled and said, "Really? Then I'll trouble you. I've decided to give you two hundred silver dollars."</p>
<p>The rogue said, "With me, I guarantee your success, but you must give me the reward first, and then I will be the matchmaker!"</p>
<p>The man hesitated and said, "I can't do that. Maybe let me see the girl first."</p>
<p>The rogue said, "If the girl sees you looking so rustic, she will definitely refuse to marry you at all costs. I can only hide it from her. How can I let you see her? But don't worry, I can write you a guarantee."</p>
<p>The discussion ended there, and the man paid the rogue two hundred dollars. The rogue wrote a guarantee on the spot and handed it to the man for safekeeping.</p>
<p>The guarantee read: "Pockmarks, no hair, pitch black, feet not very good-looking."</p>
<p>The man asked, "What does the guarantee say? Please read it to me!"</p>
<p>The rogue read, "No pockmarks, pitch black hair, feet not very big, good-looking!"</p>
<p>The man listened, very pleased with himself, and waited for happiness to come.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. The celestial-like bride that the man had been hoping for day and night was finally married into his house. After sending her to the room and removing her veil, the man was shocked. He rushed to the neighboring village to scold the rogue, "You living swindler! What angel descended from heaven? She's simply a monster from the netherworld! What did you write on the guarantee? How did it become a person who is both pockmarked and ugly, with black skin and pig trotter feet?"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he grabbed the rogue, ready to go to court. The villagers also gathered around.</p>
<p>The rogue calmly said, "Everyone, listen to me. If I am unreasonable, I am naturally willing to be punished. Don't go to the court. I clearly wrote it on the guarantee. This is who he is willing to marry. If you don't believe me, have him take out the guarantee to see."</p>
<p>When the man heard this, he took out the guarantee with a hundred times more courage. The rogue relied on the crowd and said, "Everyone, there are literate people here, please see if it is not written clearly on this?"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he read, "Pockmarks, no hair, pitch black, feet not good-looking."</p>
<p>The crowd nodded in agreement. Only then did the man realize that he had been tricked. He had bitterness he couldn't express. He could only sigh and return home to sleep with the bride who was both pockmarked and ugly, with black skin and pig trotter feet. All the dreamlike illusions of happiness were completely shattered at this moment!</p>
<p>Casual Chat</p>
<h3>An Atmosphere of Prosperity</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received an invitation from my old friend Mr. Wang, along with two tickets, inviting me to see a variety show. The invitation read:</p>
<p>Our company is scheduled to hold rehearsals for three days from × month × day to × day, at ×× Road ×× Company.</p>
<p>Respectfully invite you to view the show. ×× Company</p>
<p>After reading it, I couldn't help but admire. We Chinese people really know how to have fun. Since Liu Adou and Li Houzhu, this hasn't changed. We truly deserve to be called an ancient and civilized country. Natural disasters are not to be feared! Foreign insults are not to be worried about, but entertainment cannot be ignored. The belief that "entertainment doesn't forget saving the country, and not saving the country doesn't forget entertainment" has become a creed that is adhered to by the majority of the people like a constitution. A slogan that can be put into practice is a gratifying phenomenon. I am truly happy for the future of the Republic of China. Some people say that Chinese people are "poor" and "suffering," but this is completely untrue. There are large gatherings to attend and good shows to watch, so where is the shadow of poverty and suffering? Originally, poverty and wealth, suffering and happiness, are only differences in degree, not absolute nouns. Who can draw a line between the two and split them in half? If there is no rice to eat, I will eat porridge. If there is no porridge to eat, I will drink soup. If Jiangsu is taken, there is still Zhejiang. If Zhejiang is taken, there is still Fujian. If we can't live on the ground, we will live in the mountains. If we can't live in the mountains, we will live on airplanes. Except for extinction, there is always room for retreat. I remember the French novelist Jules Verne said the following words, "If there is no car, I will ride a horse. If there is no horse to ride, I will walk on foot. If there are no feet, I will crawl on my hands. If there are no hands, I will roll on my belly." The Chinese people also have this courage to retreat.</p>
<p>Enjoyment is originally a natural desire of human beings, but it must be based on "enduring hardship." We must know that clean streets are created by the full body filthiness of cleaners, but Chinese people are too smart. They only know how to enjoy themselves and are unwilling to endure hardship. The hardships given to them by others, of course, don't count. As a result, one person is happy, and ten thousand people are sad. One day of joy, and three hundred and sixty-four days of frowning. This is truly not worth it!</p>
<p>Writing this far, someone said to me, "Even just one day of joy is better than a year of frowning. Worry can hurt the body, it must be relieved." I said, "I don't pick up a gun and fight, sitting at my desk writing manuscripts, it is already quite relieving. The righteous soldiers fighting in the icy and snowy fields are too narrow-minded and unwilling to relieve their stress." This is probably due to the climate. The weather in the north is cold, and their brains are probably already frozen numb. Otherwise, northerners would definitely love to listen to Peking opera. When I have the chance, I really want to invite famous actors and actresses from all over the country to the northeast to reward the troops, sending a little bit of an "atmosphere of prosperity" to the frontier.</p>
<p>Family Problems</p>
<h3>Deceiving Wives</h3>
<p>— Feng Zhao</p>
<p>At ten o'clock the night before yesterday, I was sitting at my desk writing a letter when I heard footsteps on the stairs. Mr. Wang from the back building was knocking and shouting, "Ruiying! Ruiying! Open the door!" Then there were two loud bangs! But Mrs. Wang, Ms. Ruiying, in the room seemed to be asleep, without a sound. Mr. Wang kept knocking and shouting, but she just ignored him. After a full five minutes, Mr. Wang's knocking became more urgent! Bang! Bang! He knocked five or six times in a row, and the door came down naturally without waiting for anyone to open it. At this time, I predicted that the couple in the back building would at least put on a half-act of a full-scale fight! Unexpectedly, this Mr. Wang not only wasn't angry but instead patiently smiled and said, "Ruiying! Ruiying! Are you angry? Why don't you open the door!" That Ms. Ruiying said with tears and complaints, "We have only been married for a little more than three months, and you have already spent enough of my money. Now that you know my money is almost gone, your actions are no longer the same. You haven't come home for three days. Where have you been? What have you been doing? Alas! Ask your conscience!" After saying that, she started to sob. That Mr. Wang still smiled and spoke softly, discussing the rights and wrongs. At this time, I couldn't hear their argument clearly, so I continued with my work.</p>
<p>The next morning, Mr. Wang went out again, looking energetic and smiling. He still didn't come back at night. When it was quiet, I heard her sighing and saying, "Alas! I've been deceived by him again." Until midnight, I woke up from my sleep and could still hear her crying and complaining. This is such a sad thing!</p>
<p>Today at noon, she still hadn't gotten up. The landlady, fulfilling her duty, knocked on the door and persuaded her to get up. I heard her say, "He (referring to Mr. Wang) has an affair, living at ×× Road ×× Lane. They often dance and make merry, but he doesn't have any money himself. Usually, the household expenses are all from my private savings, and he often comes to deceive me out of money to spend. Whenever I want to confront them, he always uses gentle words and sweet talk to coax me. Yesterday morning, he took another sum of money from me, saying that he was going to buy things to give as gifts to get things done. He still hasn't come back. Alas, I don't need to say any more. I just admire their men's high level of deception!"</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>Shredded Pork Noodles</h3>
<p>— Ya Shi</p>
<p>Ah Yin's mother woke up in the morning, caught a cold, and got a headache. He said that this was either offending the gods or disturbing Tai Sui. She hurriedly went to the fortune-telling hall and invited the blind fortune-teller to come and calculate. The blind man said, "It doesn't matter. This is because the wandering god from the east is passing by this road and is short of travel expenses, so he came to ask for travel expenses. You only need to buy some more long ingots and Yuanbao and burn them facing east in prayer, and you will get better."</p>
<p>Ah Yin's mother listened and ordered Ah Yin to buy four jiaozi's worth of long ingots and two jiaozi's worth of large Yuanbao from the tobacco paper shop and bring them back. At night, she told Ah Yin to take them to the entrance of the alley and burn them facing east in prayer. Ah Yin obediently agreed.</p>
<p>Ah Yin went out the door and went straight to the tobacco paper shop where he had bought them, saying that they were no longer needed and asked him to return them at half the purchase price. The tobacco paper shop, seeing that there was profit to be made, quickly took them back and took out twenty-five copper coins for two jiaozi. Ah Yin took the money and ran to the noodle shop to eat a big bowl of shredded pork noodles and find two pieces of spareribs. He ran back and said to his mother, "Mom, I took them to the entrance of the alley and burned them facing east and prayed. Is your head feeling any better?"</p>
<p>His mother said to him as if she had won a victory, "Good boy, this fortune-teller is really accurate. My head is already half less painful."</p>
<p>When Ah Yin heard these words, he covered his mouth with both hands, laughing so hard that he bent over. He ran outside the door and muttered to himself, "Thank God, if my mother gets this kind of headache every day, it will allow me to eat shredded pork noodles and spareribs every day, haha."</p>

<p>International News</p>
<h3>The Experience of Soviet Films in Japan</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The first time the Japanese saw a Soviet film was in 1926. The film was titled "Battleship Potemkin." However, it was not publicly screened, but only test-screened once in Yokohama. Later, "Storm," "The Three Million Dollar Affair," and "Mother" were successively imported. We know that Gorky's original "Mother" could not be screened in Japan. Following this, "Bear's Wedding," "Death Tower," "Princess of the Commune," "Woman's Victory," and "Serf's Wings" were imported. These films were generally banned from screening.</p>
<p>There was a period of interruption in between. Later, there were "Storm Over Asia," "Spring," "The Whole Line," "Earth," "Soviet March to the North," "Struggle for Survival," "He Who Holds the Camera," "Five-Year Plan," and "Comrade of the World."</p>
<p>All of the above films were publicly screened, which certainly aroused strong interest among Japanese audiences. In particular, "Five-Year Plan" enabled the Japanese to have a deep understanding of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>At this time, there is one thing that we should particularly mention, which is "New Women." This is a Soviet cultural film, a valuable work, but unfortunately, it could not be screened.</p>
<p>Later came the era of sound films. For example, "Life Guidance," directed by Nikolai Ekk, surpassed American films in terms of film theory and film technology. Other sound films include "Quiet Flows the Don," "Alone," "Two Meetings," and "Zadvenka."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of them cannot be fully released, and few can see the whole picture. Regarding religious aspects, such as "Death of the Church," "A Section of His Father's Worries," social evils, such as rich peasants poisoning the farm cattle in the "Earth", mass actions, music such as the International, etc., are absolutely forbidden. This may be unfortunate for the Japanese audience.</p>

<h3>The Future of German Sound Films</h3>
<p>— Modern</p>
<p>│Competing to Sell to the Chinese Market│</p>
<p>The film industry in China has always been in the hands of American gilded films. Those seductive, sensual, frivolous, and licentious American films are best able to cater to Chinese tastes. Therefore, for the past fifteen years, the film industry has always been dominated by the United States. However, in recent years, Germany, which is unwilling to be second to anyone, has gradually risen in its struggle and paid attention to the Eastern market, and it is an undeniable fact that it wants to compete with the United States. The Ufa company in the past was a powerful contender.</p>
<p>Today, the entire Ufa company's works have been acquired by Universal Film Company, so its momentum is even stronger, and it is preparing to do a big job in China. Because the German style is fundamentally different from American films, that kind of realistic portrayal, great courage, and flexible camera shots have left an indelible mark in the minds of the Chinese people. Universal Film Company is willing to do it and dares to do it based on this point. The first work has arrived in Shanghai, called "Dragon and Phoenix Dance."</p>
<p>However, the ambition of German film merchants is not "just this." Following this, a German Film Company was created. Their plan is to introduce the entire elite products of the entire German film industry to Shanghai. At the same time, because Shanghai is experiencing the great threat of the "January 28th Incident," the tragic scene of shooting and bombing is floating in the hearts of everyone. This "Battle of Shanghai" gave the people of Shanghai a very special lesson. Therefore, their first sound film to be transported was "Westfront 1918 (The Western Front)", and the pictures depicted were dilapidated and destroyed houses, battlefields bombed by artillery shells, and soldiers who resisted to the end. It is almost a replay of the past "Zhabei Battle" in front of the public, and one has to admire their intelligence. At the same time, they also have sound projectors to compete with American machines.</p>
<p>In summary, the struggle between German and American films has begun. However, the responsibility of our filmmakers in China is relatively heavier from now on. To allow foreigners to come to our China and take over the host's role, like a country losing extraterritorial rights, letting foreign aggression run rampant, until what day will it end?</p>
<p>"The Western Front" is produced by German Film Company and is a war masterpiece aimed at the American film "All Quiet on the Western Front."</p>

<h3>The Evolution of the Style of Domestic Films and Future Trends</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Domestic films, which are very rare, have been around for more than ten years since their inception. Although this period is not long, there have indeed been several changes in its course. Now, I will briefly record it and add a kind of prediction, that is, the future trend.</p>
<p>In the beginning, so-called domestic films were simply a mess, a terrible state of affairs. Of course, there was no art to speak of, and society did not pay much attention to it, regarding it as a street performance. The "Orphan Saves Ancestors" produced by Star Film Company caused a sensation and broke a bloody path for the domestic film industry. Film companies were established one after another. At that time, the style mostly focused on social descriptions, revealing layers of dark secrets as much as possible, so it was called a social film. Tianyi and Great China were engaged in the production of unofficial history films, which indirectly created the rise of costume films. The news spread that it seemed that only costume films were possible, so that was the first period of change, from the social style to the costume style.</p>
<p>Seeing that costume films had become exhausted, China Drama and United Film two companies opened up new avenues and engaged in the creation of martial arts films. The popularity of "White Hibiscus" and "Shandong Heroes" was welcomed. Domestic film circles, who were good at imitating, also changed course to each other, so this was the second period of change, from costume to martial arts.</p>
<p>When prosperity reaches its peak, it must be balanced. The martial arts films that were popular for a while were also eliminated. After the opening of the Star Film Company's mythological film "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple," it achieved unexpected success in business. As a result, domestic films generally believed that it was necessary to "burn." This was the third period of change, from martial arts to mythology.</p>
<p>Due to the vigorous and resolute action of the Capital Film Censorship Committee, mythological films were on the verge of collapse. Coincidentally, imported sound films were popular, and domestic films flocked to the production of sound films. This was the fourth period of change, from mythology to sound.</p>
<p>Domestic films are still going through the sound wave, but recently there have been some signs of decline. Imperceptibly, they will gradually tend towards a road of wild customs, hunting beast films. As for more future changes, no one dares to predict.</p>
<p>Brief History of Star Film Company</p>
<h3>A Realistic Sketch of Garbo's Childhood</h3>
<p>— Translated by He</p>
<p>The location is Stockholm, the capital of Sweden.</p>
<p>In a small courtyard behind an apartment building, a girl is playing, talking to her dolls, teasing them like children. She walks back and forth, her hands moving, her postures changing, her voice gentle, sometimes cooing, sometimes laughing. She has rich emotions and loves to act, often acting.</p>
<p>This courtyard is no different from any other courtyard in Stockholm. A patch of green grass reveals patches of gray earth. The sunlight scatters its joy and warmth, truly a small, shaded place, especially on cool summer evenings.</p>
<p>But the girl playing with her doll makes that courtyard even more prominent. She is our Greta, Greta Gustafsson.</p>
<p>Time passes pleasantly and peacefully, and the girl gradually grows up. She has discarded her doll and replaced it with schoolbooks. But her love for acting is still the same as before, perhaps even more intense.</p>
<p>This small courtyard is still her playground; still the center of her dreams, ambitions, and hopes. And now it has become a stage, because here she often gathers many children to play acting games. She instructs them on how to move, tells them what to do, always guiding them with a joyful smile and enthusiasm, jumping and running around.</p>
<p>"You be the mother," she orders, "you be the father, you be the little brother..."</p>
<p>Thus, among a group of children and some older people, various games are performed, full of children's fantasies and children's love for acting, but with an intention controlling the whole.</p>
<p>Time passes year after year. One summer evening, the girl sits in an open-air theater near her home, watching actors and actresses perform their roles. She is not only happy but also feels a different kind of interest. Here, her inner personality is revealed.</p>
<p>Several years later, her friends know that she is working as a film actress, but they are not surprised. This was what they expected. They talk about the scene in the small courtyard after dinner or in the evening when they were children, nodding their heads in deep understanding.</p>
<p>Later, Greta's reputation in the film industry suddenly increases. She leaves Stockholm, leaves this small courtyard, parks, and shade, but she constantly brings infinite glory to her hometown. In the dark theaters, people who used to play with her when she was a child watch her perform the drama of life; her childhood friends praise her and say that they are not surprised by Greta's fame.</p>
<p>Her childhood fantasies have come true.</p>
<p>Her brother and I are sitting together in a cafe on the veranda of a famous Stockholm hotel. Across a small stream to our right stands a royal castle. We sit in its quiet shade, looking past many rows of pointed roofs to see the old city where Garbo grew up. The Swedish prince and his friends are sitting in the corner of the cafe, about three tables away from us. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>What I See</h3>
<p>— Hu Zheming</p>
<p>If every Chinese person stopped watching imported films, I think the amount of money flowing out of China each year could be reduced by at least several million dollars. (But it's more than that.)</p>
<p>If the money spent on watching imported films were donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army, I think at least several thousand more enemies could be killed.</p>
<p>If our dear compatriots could exclusively watch domestically produced films, just like the Japanese exclusively smoke Japanese cigarettes, then all of our country's film production companies could have at least several million dollars in extra income each year. If there were several million dollars more each year to cultivate the fledgling domestic film industry, I think domestic films would eventually compete with imported films for glory.</p>
<p>If our country's film producers could abandon their mutual infighting and work together to compete with imported films, I think domestic films would eventually defeat imported films because our fellow filmgoers will definitely have a sense of national consciousness.</p>
<p>I hope that my dear compatriots who exclusively watch imported films, even if the current domestic films are not worthy of your attention, please still have some national consciousness, watch fewer imported films, and save some vitality for the country. Although art has no borders, it is unbearable to let money flow out of the country for entertainment when the country is facing difficulties.</p>
<p>I hope that the editors of film publications will work hard to promote domestic films, use a fair attitude to criticize and guide, and do not act as volunteer promoters exclusively for imported films. (Gratitude is offered)</p>
<p>Film Essay</p>
<h3>The Eyes Are the Windows of the Soul</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabe</p>
<p>Among all the organs of the human body, the eyes are the most powerful in expressing emotions. The muscles of the eyes directly penetrate into the middle of the brain, uniting psychological activities with physical activities. These muscles have a spiritual power that other organs do not possess. The eyes, face, and head are the three most important parts of the body for expressing emotions. Without these three parts, we cannot talk about the art of performance. If an actor closes his eyes or completely covers his head, no matter how beautiful the movements of any part of his body, the emotions in his heart cannot be expressed.</p>
<p>For example, in a dance or on a speech stage, when someone suddenly stands in the center of the stage, the eyes of the audience will definitely be fixed on his face, and from his face, they will concentrate on his eyes. What the audience pays the most attention to is this person's eyes.</p>
<p>When two people meet for the first time, you look into my eyes, and I look into your eyes. Will the two people love each other or hate each other in the future? This question is largely decided at the moment when these four eyes meet. The same is true for two fighting animals, such as dogs and cats. Before any power is compared, the first thing the two sides compare is their eyesight. This is the knowledge we get from our daily observations.</p>
<p>Why is that? Because everyone believes that the other person's intentions can be detected from his eyes, because everyone believes that the eyes are the windows of the soul, and the depths of a person's soul can be found inside the pupils.</p>
