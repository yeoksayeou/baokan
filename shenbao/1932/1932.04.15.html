<p>時評</p>
<h3>國難會議之成績彬</h3>
<p>（綏靖）與（救災）。隔昨旣已分别評論至於（禦侮）一問題。吾人認爲毫無討論之餘地蓋守土自衛政府負有絶對之責任。九一八禍變發生。崇朝之間淪落半壁山河。張學良全。師退却。一再聲言（一切惟服從中央）。而政府對張並未見律以喪土辱國之罪。收復失地之呼聲。今亦歸於沉寂。以故對於此一問題。吾人認爲無再加以討論之必要。今國難會議。業已閉幕。請檢閲其成績。予以正確之評論。</p>
<p>國難會議於七日開幕。十二日閉幕。據報紙之紀錄。到會會員一百四十七人。開會六次。除聽取數次軍事政治財政外交等之報告。與（精誠團結共赴國難）之訓話外。提案一百零六件。决議照例必有之數十案。致慰勞東北義勇軍。慰勞顔代表。嘉慰華僑。嘉慰上海民衆。勗勉全國將士。至國聯調查團文電各一通。發表閉幕宣言一則。歡宴數次。斯即爲所謂國難會議之成績。此種會議。邇年以來。無歲無之討論决議。宣言口號。歡宴閉幕。爲會議一定之程序。在政府固已練習嫻熟在人民亦已視爲（司空見慣）。數年來會議之成績固何如耶。以昔例今。正復相類。而謂此次國難會議。以短短六次之會議。其精神遂足以打破國難。則吾人未敢輕信中外歷史上有此奇蹟也。</p>
<p>吾人檢閲到會會員之名單。若干爲過去及現任之官吏。三分之二爲國民黨員故與其謂斯會爲（農工商學之大聯合）毌寗謂爲（官吏）（黨員）優秀份子）之大聯合。其目的純爲敷衍人民。緩和責難。故會中之主張。與政府之意向。皆有和諧之節奏。汪院長致開會詞曰。（禦悔最需民族思想能一致）前天津市長臧啓芳氏致閉會詞。遂謂（此次本會最大精神。爲不分黨派階級。對禦侮係一致）。而且在（禦悔）一案中正式成立决議。汪院長在開會詞中又曰。（造成國難之責任不能專責於黨）而陶孟和氏之答詞。遂謂（今國民不能以國難全責加諸國民黨）汪院長代表政府報告中。謂（訓政時期。不得不延長。政府之目的。在使訓政完成。憲政趨向光明这路而不入於民元時代黑暗之路）而梅思平氏報告審查政制改革案。遂主張（公開政治實施憲政）等案不提出討論汪院長謂（會中討論可自由）立法院委員高一涵氏之答詞。遂謂（到會之後不特討論未有範圍。言論亦絶對自由。）汪院長又謂（國難會議爲民族精神團結之最高表現。）高一函氏之答詞。謂（我們今日在洛開會。可説已經充分表示此種足以戰勝一切惡劣環境之精神。）尤有甚者。臧啓芳氏之閉會詞中有曰。（最後尚有一鄭重聲明。本會議現完全結束。同人今後亦祇能以國民資格。努力向前。而不可再用國難會議之名義。）是更無異於代表政府致訓詞若曰。（六次之會議。已得圓滿之結果。并暗示此後會員。不得再借國難會員之頭銜。日以集會發通電爲事。在外招搖。予政府以不利）。殆無一處不爲仰承當局之旨意。作可憐之應聲。帮助政府撤彌天之大謊。以朦蔽人民之耳目。故斯會之蓋棺定論。不過徒爲一幕技術純熟之雙簧耳。上下交相欺。上下交相譽。國難云何哉。救國云何哉</p>
<h3>停戰會議小組會亦延期</h3>
<p>駐兵問題日謀破壞我主權</p>
<p>經友邦勸告無效續議無期</p>
<p>停戰會議、因日方態度頑强、暫告停頓、須由國聯特委會解釋後再舉行、僅小組會照常開會、惟昨晨小組會、在英領署舉行、竟無結果而散、無期展延、繼續開會之期、尚未决定、據公報謂須請示後始悉、會議可謂等於破裂、茲將昨日會議經過分誌如下、</p>
<p>小組會議經過軍事小組委員會、於昨晨十時、在英領事署舉行、出席代表我方黄强郭德華、日方田代·西村·阿部·梶原四人、及英美法意各國參贊、開會後、先由日方代表發言、仍要求我方説明駐軍情形、其提出條件三條、（一）蘇州河以南及浦東、究竟有中國軍隊多少、須請中國代表説明、並指示出何處有軍隊、何處無軍隊、（二）日軍撤退時、在上述兩地軍隊、究竟欲攻擊否、（三）即使華軍於日軍撤退時、不施攻擊、但當日軍撤退至雙方同意之江灣閘北等地黠時、在上述兩地之華軍、不得調防、當時我立代表則加以駁復、謂日方所詢之浦東南市兩點、旣不屬於本會範圍之内、當然不能討論、其提出之日軍駐紥期内、我方在浦東南市之軍隊、不得調防、更無理由、蓋此點更妨害中國之主權、中國政府、當然不能承認、况果如日代表所言、則設或該兩地發生地方上重大之擾亂、如土匪之聚刦、反動分子之暴動、而原有軍警力量單薄、不足以彈壓、則中國政府、果否將派兵前往、抑履行日方提出不得調動軍隊之請求耶、惟中國方面、極有誠意、使此會成功、甚希望小組委員會能迅速解决、而得一圓滿結果、日方至是、仍堅持原議、而我方亦言不能答復、會議形勢、甚爲緊張、各友邦代表見會議將濒破裂、遂居中緩衝、我方代表乃謂、日方要求、本無答復必要、惟按照協定第一項之末句、載明、各友邦代表須視察雙方履行條件之語、則我方爲便利各友邦代表起見、於日軍退駐規定地點後、可將南市浦東情形、向各友邦武官報告、至日方提出此種要求、中國代表仍認爲非常駭異、因按理實無提出此種要求之必要、除非别有用心、此則中國方面不得不防者云、而日代表仍謂不能滿意、始終要求將蘇州河以南情形説明、因日軍之側背、將發生危險云云、我代表即謂、日軍撤退後、其左翼全可得租界之保護、實無詢問蘇州河以南我軍之必要、山屢提出在基本原則内所無之問題、而使小組會不能進行、此點、中國代表不負責任、至此會議幾如破裂、雙方各不發言、各友邦代表又竭力調停、乃宣告延期、繼續開會期未定、日方於會議畢、曾言將請示總代表、</p>
<p>小組會議公報　小組委員會昨日數會後、會塲發表公報云、（軍事小組委員會、今日繼續討論、對華軍駐防問題、雙方代表、有若干點未能接近、本會暫行休會、由雙方代表各行請示首席代表後、再行定期談判）云、</p>
<p>郭泰祺氏談話　新聲社記者、昨晤我國首席代表郭泰旗氏、詢以小組會無期延展後、是否須待國聯有明白表示後再開、郭氏謂、未能定、惟大致如大會繼續舉行、則小組會亦將隨之而開、此次小組會議、暫時不能進行原因、乃爲日本方面提出種種與原則無關之意外問題、實違背國聯三月四日决議案、對撤兵之期間、呑吐再三、致未能進行、至大會則須俟國聯開會解釋日軍撤兵之時期一點、因三月四日國聯决議、僅令日本撤兵、其詳細辦法、并未規定、故須待解釋、記者後又詢以對於此會前途之感想、郭氏聞語蹙眉搖首而言曰、尚有何説、語氣中含無限感慨、對於該會、似抱十分悲觀云　　郭德華氏談話　據出席小組會議之中國代表郭德華氏、昨語國聞社記者云、小組會議開會迄今、所談各點、完全爲討論性質、並無决定一案、外傳簽字等等、完非事實、日方在會議席上、屢提節外生枝議案、我方以不在三原則之規定終不予討論、今日小組會議、結果毫無進步、下次會議、日方請示總代表後再定云、</p>
<p>地點並未確定　昨日散會後、官塲發言人稱、對於小組會議、因日方條件苛刻、且不遵國聯决議案討論、故而展延、至小會中前數次之討論、并無决定、外傳撤軍地點之妥洽、均係接近、而并未確定云、</p>
<p>報告國聯裁决　郭泰祺復電云、上海市民聯合會虹口各區分會臨時辦事處鑒、來電誦悉、此次中日停戰會議、我方始終根據國聯大會决議案、要求日軍定期完全撤退、乃日方堅拒不肯定期、會議已成僵局、現我政府業將經過情形、報告國聯特委會裁决矣、特覆、郭泰祺、元印、</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言訓政  瑞　　國難會議前日議决，憲政未實行以前，提前設立中央民意機關，定名爲國民代表會，他們的意思，就是想取消訓政時期，以代表會議來替代，再明白一點説，代表會議就是爲軍政時期與憲政時期的過渡辦法，惟代表會之代表如何産生，與制度之是否適宜，不在今天所欲的範圍之内，姑且不論，我且討論訓政二字。　　天下的事情，無一件不可胡亂幹去，惟有這教訓兩字，須有一些實際，以品行卑汚，文理不通的人，擔任教訓起來，萬萬做不到的，因此講起國民黨的訓政兩字，簡直是最可笑的一件事。　　國民黨不是没有品行較好，博通今古的人才，但是寥寥可數，可餘的黨員，或是店内小夥計，和小學教員，或讀書不成，學業不成的，一到國民軍進來，便拿起招牌，轟轟烈烈，來打倒一般土豪劣紳買辦階級，好百姓見得聲勢赫赫，不久便貼貼服服被征服了。　　政府見軍政時期已經終了丨其實未曾終了！便糊裏糊塗下了一個命令，實行訓政了，什麽呌訓政，就是各團體，及一般老百姓皆須由該黨員講明主義，指導一切，否則不論任何機關，不准成立。　　嘻！糟了，試思各團體及老百姓中尚有老成碩望不少的人才，或是明瞭上下古今的碩土，或是深識中外政術之通才，或出洋留學，或大學畢業，比黨員高明得多，若講到三民主義，彼等雖不入黨，亦曉得主義的來歷，與厲行的利弊，偏欲屈服於一般少不更事一知半解的青年黨員，反奉爲訓政的導師·豈不寃枉麽，豈不好笑麽。　　韓退子曰（生乎我前，其聞道也固先乎吾，吾從而師之，生乎我後，其聞道也亦先乎吾，吾從而師之，吾師道也，夫庸知其年之先後乎），這話原是不差，我現在回顧頭來，且看看黨員之道，關了大門，自相殘殺，黨員之道也，炙手可熱，以勢凌人，黨員之道也，驕奢淫逸，一襪之費約三十元，黨員之道也，縱欲敗度，一宅之資數十萬，黨員之道也，黨員之道固甚多矣，我安得不從而師之。大衆文藝近聞四首  夢苕主　　人世滄桑第幾回，無端驚浪起蓬萊，夢邊失鹿皆吾土，眼底屠鯨孰將才，笳鼓一宵江上急，衣冠百輩賊中來，紛紛那與胡僧事，一任昆明付刧灰，　　傳聞九鼎卜西遷，吟望神州涕泪懸，龍漢亦愁仙佛刧，紅羊况值亂離年，此身自分終沈陸，與賊何堪共戴天，大好家居撞已壞，憑誰隻手定三邊，　　舉國紛争黨李牛，高臺那復鳳皇遊，横流到處成滄海，錯鐵何人鑄六州，此日驚風皆草木，當時未雨欠綢繆，補牢誰道眞無及·莫把金甌一擲休，　　是和是戰論紛歧，借一如今事已遲，豈有寃禽塡大海，空看鳥鵲避南枝，諸公竟守偏安局，此着眞成最後棋，不盡江南開府恨，夢魂猶想中興時，有感  陳伯英　　一月二十八日夜半日軍犯我次日聞十九路軍蔡廷楷將軍拒敵　　今日還留漢織看。魯陽戈健角聲寒。夢中眞覺天將墮。喜極翻教淚不乾。散盡藏書寗有恨。數來守土獨無　。尤憐士氣如山湧。一卒仍拚彈一丸。大衆科學飛機  乃徵　　午飯後翻閲本埠增刋，有夏仁傑君提議的信，説欲以實力的提倡飛機與高射砲，以抵抗暴日：夏君並擬以薪捐買，不勝欽佩·余正在執筆之時，空中又有扶行扶行的聲音，慘無人道的日機在示威。誠然，我們這次確是吃牠的大虧，所以後方的人民，亦弄得搬東遷西，走頭無路。聽説暴日侵犯後第二天，他們國内知道（惟我方飛機能破壞支那甚力）·所以後來他們人民即捐集金錢造飛機數只·聞已經出塢，有數只加入公開飛行表演過·此實因他們的政府在平日對飛行提倡甚力，並且人民亦知道飛機對於戰争上如何重要，如何便宜；而我國人民則不知如何·今余以初步的搜集，介紹出來，一同討論·　　在西曆一千九百零三年十二月十七日的清晨。美國來脱（Ｗrignt）兄弟二人，正駕着他們所造的飛機試飛，但是參觀的人祇有幾十個，他們兄弟二人各自飛行了兩次·最好的一次記錄，是飛行在空中，有一分鐘之久；飛行了八百五十五英尺。這是第一次人類坐在飛行機上航空，他們非常幸運，未出危險。後來他們二人再繼續研究，至一千九百零五年十月五日，在空中飛行了五十分三秒之久，飛行路程有二十四英里又四分之一，（一英里等於五千二百八十英尺）飛行的速率每小時三十八英里。在空中從一切鐘增至五十三分，是經研究一年又九個月，其中用去金錢，廢去心血，則不可計數。從一千九百零五年至一千九百十年。在這五年内，我們在空中自由飛行成功事實了。現在航空非常的發達，各國無不在改良，精益求精，除了交通之用外，其他尚能運貨帶郵，致於戰争上則更不可缺少牠。還有探險，航空測量，研究天空空氣氣壓，天空攝影等的用途。　　氣球利用輕氣滿儲於氣囊内，使之上昇，要到何處去，乘者不能作主，須看風的方向如何；飛艇（Ａirship）則用橢圓的氣囊，滿儲輕氣或氦，使之上昇；下埀一只小艇，頭上裝螺旋推進機，後面有舵，這樣進退可如意也。飛機（Ａ（）riplan）是重於空氣的，牠能夠上昇，便靠空氣的抗力勝過牠自身的重量；抗力是從前面二葉推進機（propeller）打動空氣而來的：推進機愈大，旋轉得愈快，則打動空氣愈急而愈多，抗力亦因此而愈大。抗力則抗在飛機的兩旁翼（Ｗ（）ihg）上的，翼愈大，則能吃抗力愈多；所以要載重的飛，必須推進機大，能轉得快，翼的面積大。本來可以畫一張圖，是關係力學上的，但是報上不能印，所以前面説得詳細一些。　　飛機有二種，一種是陸飛機（Ａ（）irplan），即平常呌牠飛機；還有一種是水飛機（Ｓeaplan）；但是我們要注意，不是一種在陸地上飛，一種在水上飛，這不過因爲一種是停在陸地上，從陸地上飛起來，一種是可以停在水面上，並能從水面上飛起來；所以有這兩種名稱。這兩種飛機再分成複翼飛機（Ｂiplane）,單翼飛機（Ｍonoplane）　　陸飛機的機身下面的架上，有二個或三個橡皮邊的小輪盤（Ｗheels）,在起飛時或降下時，着在地面上磨擦而轉的；並不是像摩托車的輪盤，有機力使牠轉的。水飛機的機身下面，有二只不漏水的，像小艇形狀的浮體，所以能停浮在水面上；牠也能夠降落（Ｌanb　on）在陸地上，但是陸飛機不能停落在水面上的，因爲牠汉浮體托起牠的身體。再講到複翼飛機是一種流行的式子，有二只翼子在身體的每一旁，牠的翼子稍爲長而狹一些。單翼飛機是祗有一只翼子在一面，翼子是大一些，用一種薄而輕的堅韌的合金製成的。　　轉動推進機的機械是用汽油引擎（Gasoline　Engine）因爲取牠最輕而有極大的能力。有一種普通的呌ＷrightWhirlwihd　Ehgine有九只汽缸（Ｃylinder）,利用空氣冷却的，要有到二百匹馬力。大的飛機裝有三只推進機，而發動機亦要用三部。飛機的尾部有使左右轉彎的舵，牠是像船上用的舵一樣，還有上下平衡的舵，使飛機高低；這二種舵是互相埀直的。　　空中飛行者，終是比較在陸地上行的車子危險，並且路又難認，不知自已高高低低，所以飛機内必備各重要的儀器，如自記高度表，空氣速率計，無線電機，升降計，精密指南針等·隨便談談難民之羣  吾　　從前的静安古刹，現在已成爲滿目凄凉的難民收容所了。　　偌大的佛堂中，光線是如此的黯澹，難民們都在這黑黯中呼吸，陰霾恐怖，擁裏着婦女與小孩蠕動，她們無力的侷促在鋪在地上的汚穢的敗絮中苦痛地呻吟，稻草的枯桿散落在她們的頭邊髮際，宛如一羣受傷的瘦狗踡伏在自已的窠巢中被突然的驚恐所懾服而不敢絲毫動顫。她們是如此齷齪，身上常會有許多白蝨發現，當她們脱下内衣在尋找的時候。小孩兒們也同樣的給飢餓所攫住，他們有的是散懶在每親的懷裏，有的是失却了母親的慈愛而在某個角落裏拐着脚哭泣。新生的嬰孩們仍是無時或失的吸吮着母親的乾癟的乳房，因爲乳汁的缺乏以致他們發出貪欲怕悲鳴。上了所紀的老婆婆們，除了不時發出深長的嘆息外，也常和其他的人們攀談着陳舊的往事。在她們的記憶中，洪楊革命的血迹，仍是模糊的依稀可見，而江浙戰争以及國民軍的北伐等戰績，更是赤色斑爛的尚餘血腥，這些古往今來的英雄們的勾當，在她們已是司空見慣的毫不爲奇，可是這次外國人到上海來殺人放火，在她們到是矌古未有傷心慘史了。　　這裏的一切都是無秩序，散亂。老人們的嘆息，小孩們的哭聲，他們的財産，她們的子女，都在大砲的咆哮下變成了灰燼，他們現在雖然從帝國主義的鐵蹄下逃奔了出來，可是無饜的飢饉在鞭撻着他，更使他們深沉的領受着戰争所賜與的痛苦了。　　他們在無可奈何的當中只得在此静候着慈善家的賑濟，雖然是多少含有羞意，然而爲了還要苟延殘喘又是什麽辦法呢？　　他們是這樣日以繼夜的在困苦中挨過那無邊的歲月。他們所感受的是殺人！放火！離散！死亡！他們睡的是破敗的草稈，他們吃的是碎米的稀粥。他們終日的簡直不能痛快的嘻笑一次，他們完全將自已沉溺在悲苦的深淵中而不思有所拯救。然而在他們心中還有一種共同的感覺：（是的，我的家人給他們殺了，我的房屋給他們燒了，但是，我們的血在沸騰，我們的心在狂躍，總有一個時候，總有一個時候啊，看我們將殺人者殺滅乾净！：：：）　　啊！這憤怒！這仇恨！當這惡意的心情凝成一片的時候，將可看到大地亦因之變色了。東西南北意見  建　　農夫説，（國家到了這樣危險的地步，除非岳老爺出世，否則毫無辦法，）　　小販説，（祇要東洋大地震，中國便有希望了，）車夫説，（最好花旗人，羅宋人和東洋拚命的打一仗，）　　念佛老婆婆説，（東洋人用不着睬他，等他的惡貫滿時，天老爺自然會來收他的，）　　基督教徒説，（祇有一個法子，就是耶穌來救，）一鱗一爪圓桌會議  一臧　　圓桌會議的（Ｒound　TableConfence）各稱，是在中世紀英國亞沙王與其騎士圍繞圓桌協議各種問題起頭的，但是爲什麽緣故要圍繞圓桌會議？因爲他的騎士们都各有所長，倘若用他種方式會議，席次不免有高低上下，他們心裏不願坐在後面，或坐在下位，所以亞沙王想出很平等的圓桌會議法，這就是圓桌會議的濫觴，到了前年印度爲謀自治，發生了獨立問題，英國又請甘地赴英，召集印度各派代表，在倫敦開英印圓桌會議，他如在日本開太平洋會議　，也用圓桌式，此次上海事變，日本人提出圓桌會議，可是停戰撤兵問題没有解决以前，當然不能舉行的。一封從軍去的信  月中小殘　　我摰愛的母親；你不是希望你的兒子出門來大大的發展嗎？記得在臨别的那早晨丨一個初春的清晨·渺無人跡的北街上·一個慈仁的老母，對着一個携帶行李的二十多歲的少年，再三囑咐着；　　（兒呀！你要知道，你要明白，族下的對你親戚的對你，人們的，咳，你是没有一人扶助的，你要自立，你從今出門後，更是一個人孤單單的造就自已的生命，更没有我時時照拂着你：希望你的父親在九泉下有靈，祖宗有靈，在默佑着你，默佑着一個異鄕漂泊的孤兒·的事業來：：：：）此時你的聲音嗚咽了！　　在那晨風微拂的一刹那，人間又是一度的别離了！　　母親，從那一個春晨别離後，你的兒便成了一個天涯淪落的人了，舟過巫峽時，峽水的奔騰，是激盪了他底心潮，他在一刹那深深地感到了慈愛的偉大，他覺得他是應該永遠地依傍故廬裏？他的靈魂，是應該永遠皈依在慈親的滕前，當他在天涯漂泊的時候，　　（轟：：轟：：：轟：：：）　　啊！民族的戰争要爆發了，暴風雨的時代來臨了，兩軍的戰塲展開了，呀，血鐘響了，砲彈炸了，我們前線的同胞呀，是一個個猛撲倒了，母親呀！這就是我們大中國被强暴的日本帝國侵略的危急存亡的時候，母親呀！這就是你兒子底意境嚴重轉變的時候了！　　母親：你往時不是要做深明大義的母親嗎？不是説要做爲兒剌背的岳飛的母親嗎？不是勉勵兒要做岳飛一樣的（精忠報國）嗎？如果兒有一日盡忠報。，我想母親一定很喜歡的，現在報國的時候是到了，所以兒子現在要：：：呀！　　母親：兒子現在要從軍去了！　　我（將我手指上的血，滴來寫在這上面，母親：還你的血吧！你的兒子從軍去了！　　你的兒子寫於從軍前一日市音訊　　扶風社近訊　上海扶風社、專門配補各項書報、滬難發作、該社亦致停頓、現已遷回原處、繼續服務、各界委託、仍寄狄思威路塘裏力號可也、又該社集有時報戰事畫報二十五期訂一册、裝製精美、每册只售大洋六角、共止五十册、欲購從速、　　集郵研究社　本埠法租界辣斐德路慈安里四號集郵研究社、近爲聯絡各界起見、特備精美外國郵票百份贈送各界、附郵五分即寄十二種、公佈欄上海第一特區地方法院　　刑事第一審判决　一、戈登路捕房訴魏三强盜案（主文）魏二携帶兇器夜間侵入住宅結夥强盜一罪處有期徒刑八年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲二、總巡捕房訴陸文彬等擄人勒贖案

<h3>The Achievements of the National Crisis Conference</h3>
<p>(Pacification) and (Disaster Relief). Yesterday, we already commented separately on the issue of (Resisting Aggression). We believe there is no room for further discussion, as the government bears absolute responsibility for defending its territory. Since the September 18th Incident, half of our country has fallen within a short time. Zhang Xueliang’s entire army retreated, repeatedly declaring, "Everything is subject to the central government." However, the government has not held Zhang accountable for the crime of losing territory and humiliating the nation. The calls for recovering lost territory have now also subsided into silence. Therefore, regarding this issue, we believe there is no need for further discussion. Now that the National Crisis Conference has concluded, let us examine its achievements and offer an accurate assessment.</p>
<p>The National Crisis Conference opened on the 7th and closed on the 12th. According to newspaper reports, 147 members attended the conference, which convened six times. Besides listening to several reports on military, political, financial, and diplomatic matters, and the lecture on (Sincere Unity to Overcome the National Crisis), there were 106 proposals. As usual, there were dozens of resolutions, expressing condolences to the Northeast Volunteers, congratulating Representative Yan, commending overseas Chinese, commending the Shanghai populace, and encouraging the national soldiers. There was also a telegram to the League of Nations Investigation Commission and a closing declaration. Several banquets were held. This is what is referred to as the achievements of the National Crisis Conference. This type of conference has been held every year in recent years, with discussions, resolutions, declarations, slogans, banquets, and closings. These have become a fixed procedure for such meetings. The government has become proficient in these practices, and the people have become accustomed to them. What have the achievements of these conferences been over the years? The past is similar to the present. To say that this National Crisis Conference, with its short six sessions, has the spirit to overcome the national crisis is something we dare not believe, as there is no such miracle in Chinese and foreign history.</p>
<p>We have examined the list of members who attended the conference. Some are past and present officials, and two-thirds are members of the Kuomintang. Therefore, it is more accurate to call this conference a grand alliance of (Officials) and (Outstanding Party Members) rather than a (Grand Alliance of Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Academia). Its purpose is purely to appease the people and ease criticism. Therefore, the proposals and the government's intentions all had harmonious rhythms. President Wang stated in his opening address, "The most important thing in resisting aggression is national unity." Former Tianjin Mayor Zang Qifang said in his closing address, "The greatest spirit of this conference is that we are united against aggression regardless of party or class." Furthermore, a formal resolution was established on the (Resisting Aggression) issue. President Wang also said in his opening address, "The responsibility for creating the national crisis cannot be solely blamed on the party." Tao Menghe responded by saying, "Today, the people cannot place all the blame for the national crisis on the Kuomintang." President Wang, representing the government, stated in his report, "The period of political tutelage must be extended. The government's goal is to complete political tutelage and move towards a bright constitutional government, not the dark road of the early Republic." However, Mei Siping's report on the review of political system reforms advocated (Open Politics and Implementation of Constitutional Government), and these proposals were not submitted for discussion. President Wang stated, "Discussion at the meeting is free." National Assembly member Gao Yihan responded, "After arriving at the meeting, there were no restrictions on discussion, and freedom of speech was absolute." President Wang also stated, "The National Crisis Conference is the highest expression of national unity." Gao Yihan responded, "Our meeting in Luoyang today can be said to fully demonstrate the spirit to overcome all adverse circumstances." Even more serious was Zang Qifang's closing address, which stated, "Finally, there is a solemn declaration: This conference is now completely concluded. From now on, all participants can only strive forward as citizens and cannot use the name of the National Crisis Conference." This is no different from the government issuing instructions, saying, "The six sessions have yielded satisfactory results," and implying that members should not use the title of National Crisis Conference member to hold meetings and send telegrams, causing trouble and harming the government. In almost every aspect, they catered to the authorities' wishes, acting as pitiful responders, helping the government fabricate a monumental lie to deceive the people. Therefore, the final assessment of this conference is merely a well-executed ventriloquist act. Superiors and subordinates deceive each other, superiors and subordinates praise each other. What about the national crisis? What about saving the nation?</p>
<h3>The Subcommittee of the Ceasefire Conference is Also Postponed</h3>
<p>Japanese Plans to Undermine Our Sovereignty with Troop Deployment</p>
<p>Friendly Nations' Advice is Ineffective, Further Discussions Indefinitely Postponed</p>
<p>The ceasefire conference has been temporarily suspended due to the Japanese side's stubborn attitude and must be held again after the League of Nations Special Committee provides an explanation. Only the subcommittee is holding meetings as usual. However, the subcommittee meeting held at the British Consulate yesterday morning ended without result and was indefinitely postponed. The date for continuing the meeting has not yet been decided. According to the press release, instructions must be requested first. The meeting can be said to be on the verge of collapse. The details of yesterday's meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Military Subcommittee held a meeting at the British Consulate at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The representatives present were Huang Qiang and Guo Dehua from our side, Tshiro, Nishimura, Abe, and Kajiwara from the Japanese side, and the counselors from Britain, the United States, France, and Italy. After the meeting began, the Japanese representatives spoke first, still asking our side to explain the troop deployment situation. They proposed three conditions: (1) How many Chinese troops are there south of the Suzhou River and in Pudong? The Chinese representatives must explain and indicate where there are troops and where there are no troops. (2) When the Japanese troops withdraw, will the troops in the above-mentioned areas attack? (3) Even if the Chinese troops do not attack when the Japanese troops withdraw, the Chinese troops in the above-mentioned areas shall not be transferred when the Japanese troops withdraw to Jiangwan, Zhabei, and other places agreed upon by both parties. Our representatives immediately refuted this, saying that the two points raised by the Japanese side, Pudong and Nanshi, are not within the scope of this conference and cannot be discussed. There is no reason to propose that our troops in Pudong and Nanshi shall not be transferred during the period of Japanese troop deployment. This will further harm China's sovereignty, and the Chinese government will certainly not recognize it. If what the Japanese representatives said is true, then if there is a major local disturbance in the two places, such as a bandit raid or a reactionary riot, and the original police force is weak and insufficient to suppress it, will the Chinese government send troops or fulfill the Japanese request not to transfer troops? However, the Chinese side is very sincere and hopes that this conference will succeed and obtain a satisfactory result. At this point, the Japanese side still insisted on its original proposal, and our side also said it could not answer. The situation at the meeting was very tense. The representatives of friendly nations, seeing that the meeting was on the verge of collapse, mediated. Our representatives then said that there was no need to answer the Japanese side's request, but according to the last sentence of the first item of the agreement, which stated that representatives of friendly nations must inspect the implementation of the conditions by both parties, our side can report the situation in Nanshi and Pudong to the military attachés of friendly nations after the Japanese troops withdraw to the designated locations for the convenience of the representatives of friendly nations. The Chinese representatives still believe that it is very strange for the Japanese side to make this request, because in principle, there is no need to make this request unless there are ulterior motives, which the Chinese side must guard against. However, the Japanese representatives still said they were not satisfied and insisted on explaining the situation south of the Suzhou River, because the flanks of the Japanese troops would be in danger. Our representatives immediately said that after the Japanese troops withdraw, their left flank can be completely protected by the concessions, so there is no need to ask about the Chinese troops south of the Suzhou River. The Japanese side repeatedly raised issues that were not included in the basic principles, which made it impossible for the subcommittee to proceed. The Chinese representatives are not responsible for this. At this point, the meeting was almost broken, and both parties stopped speaking. The representatives of friendly nations made every effort to mediate and announced a postponement. The date for continuing the meeting has not been determined. After the meeting, the Japanese side said it would ask the chief representative for instructions.</p>
<p>Subcommittee Press Release The subcommittee issued a press release at the meeting place after several meetings yesterday, saying, "The military subcommittee continued its discussions today. The representatives of both sides failed to reach agreement on several points regarding the deployment of Chinese troops. The meeting is temporarily adjourned. The representatives of both sides will each ask their chief representatives for instructions before negotiating a new date."</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Taiqi's Remarks The reporter of the Xinsheng News Agency met with Mr. Guo Taiqi, the chief representative of our country, yesterday and asked whether the subcommittee would have to wait for a clear statement from the League of Nations before reopening after the indefinite postponement. Mr. Guo said that he could not determine, but generally speaking, if the general assembly continued to be held, the subcommittee would also open accordingly. The reason why the subcommittee meeting could not proceed temporarily this time was that the Japanese side raised all kinds of unexpected questions that were unrelated to the principles, which violated the League of Nations resolution of March 4. He hesitated again and again on the period of troop withdrawal, which prevented it from proceeding. As for the general assembly, it must wait for the League of Nations to hold a meeting to explain the time of the Japanese troop withdrawal, because the League of Nations resolution of March 4 only ordered Japan to withdraw its troops, and the detailed methods were not specified, so it must wait for an explanation. The reporter then asked about his thoughts on the future of this meeting. Mr. Guo frowned and shook his head and said, "What else can I say?" His tone contained infinite emotion and seemed very pessimistic about the meeting. Mr. Guo Dehua's Remarks According to Mr. Guo Dehua, the Chinese representative who attended the subcommittee meeting, he told the reporter of the Guowen News Agency yesterday that the points discussed at the subcommittee meeting so far are completely of a discussion nature and there is no decision. Rumors of signing, etc. are completely false. The Japanese side repeatedly raised extraneous proposals at the meeting, and our side would not discuss them because they were not stipulated in the three principles. The result of today's subcommittee meeting was no progress. The Japanese side will ask the chief representative for instructions before setting a new date.</p>
<p>The Location Has Not Been Determined After the meeting adjourned yesterday, the official spokesman said that the subcommittee meeting was postponed because the Japanese side's conditions were harsh and did not follow the League of Nations resolution for discussion. The previous discussions in the subcommittee had not been decided. Rumors that the location of the troop withdrawal had been negotiated were only close and had not been determined.</p>
<p>Report to the League of Nations for Adjudication Guo Taiqi replied in a telegram, "To the Shanghai Citizens' Federation Hongkou District Branch Temporary Office, I have received and understood your telegram. In this Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference, our side has always demanded that the Japanese army withdraw completely on schedule based on the League of Nations General Assembly resolution. However, the Japanese side firmly refused to confirm the date, and the meeting has become a stalemate. Our government has now reported the situation to the League of Nations Special Committee for adjudication. Special reply, Guo Taiqi."</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Special Committee Decides on the Date of the Meeting</h3>
<p>The Result of Yesterday's Consultation</p>
<p>The Meeting is Scheduled for the 16th</p>
<p>Tokyo Discusses Countermeasures</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency telegraphed from Geneva on the 13th that it was officially announced here today that the 19-member committee organized by the League of Nations General Assembly has decided to convene on Saturday at China's request. It is reported that this move was agreed upon today by the President of the League of Nations General Assembly and President of the 19-member committee, Foreign Minister Simon, and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond. However, at the same time, it is rumored that Simon advised the Chinese government to reopen the Shanghai ceasefire negotiations and not delay.</p>
<p>The Japanese Union News Agency telegraphed from Tokyo on the 14th that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from the Japanese delegation in Geneva today that the Chinese representative Yan Huiquing once again requested the 19-nation special committee to review the results of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire negotiations and decided to hold a meeting on the 16th to discuss this issue. Foreign Minister Fang Ze and others immediately discussed countermeasures and instructed Japanese Plenipotentiary Representative Nagaoka that only the Chinese side's agreement or disagreement remained to be discussed in the ceasefire negotiations. However, it is regrettable that the Chinese side's attitude is insincere. If the 19-nation special committee discusses the ceasefire negotiation issue, the Japanese representative has no need to participate in the meeting. Fang Ze also ordered the Japanese representative to submit a report on the progress of the ceasefire negotiations to the League of Nations. Reuters telegraphed from Tokyo on the 14th that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received an official telegram from Geneva stating that League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond informed Japanese Chief Representative Sato on April 4 that Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Yan had requested the League of Nations 19-nation special committee to hold a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the Shanghai case. However, because the Shanghai meeting was only delayed and not broken, Drummond advised Dr. Yan that this case should continue to be mediated locally in Shanghai and not be transferred to Geneva. Reuters telegraphed from Tokyo on the 14th that Nanjing denied Tokyo's claim that the League of Nations Secretariat had advised the Chinese representative in Geneva that China should continue negotiations with Japan in Shanghai and not request the League of Nations, saying that neither the Chinese representative in Geneva nor the Chinese government had received this advice. After receiving this news, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Reuters reporters today, based on reliable sources, that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs could say that the League of Nations Secretariat did have this advice for the Chinese representative in Geneva.</p>
<h3>Lin Sen Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing</h3>

<p>Chairman of the National Government Lin Sen arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the Taikoo Company's Anqing ship at 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. He visited Li Shizeng and others that day and had discussions. Yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m., Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng went to Mr. Lin's residence to pay his respects and talked for about half an hour.

After Mr. Wu left, former Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan and Director of the Land Bureau Jin Liren successively paid their respects. According to Mr. Wu Tiecheng's remarks to reporters, Chairman Lin's visit to Shanghai this time was purely a private matter. After he went to Nanjing to preside over the national government, it was his first visit to Shanghai. All of his spring and summer clothes were left in Shanghai. He came to sort them out this time and take them back to Luoyang. He will probably return to Nanjing and then to Luoyang today or tomorrow. However, according to another news report, Mr. Lin came to urge Sun Ke to go to Nanjing to overcome the national crisis together. During the previous meeting between Wang and Sun, Sun expressed his willingness to go to Luoyang.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of the Japanese Army in the Front</h3>
<p>A special telegram from Suzhou on the 14th said that at 9:00 a.m. on the 14th, one Japanese aircraft arrived in Suzhou, Taicang, and Kunshan at the same time. The aircraft flew very low, and the faces of the people in the aircraft could be seen clearly. It circled twice in each place to reconnoiter and then left. At about 3:00 p.m. on the 14th in Changshu, two loud gunshots were heard from the southeast. It was found that the Japanese were shooting a sound film in Liuhe. More than 50 houses were searched by the enemy in Jiading on the 14th. A part of the power grid laid by the enemy in the Liuhe area was removed for unknown reasons. The Japanese army stationed at Zhangjiaqiao, more than ten miles away from the east gate of Taicang, suddenly moved backward. Our army was reported by the local people there and requested to send a team to take over and maintain security. Our army has reportedly sent a team to the area. Our army's positions in the area have moved forward. The current situation in Taicang is very stable, and there is no contact at the front. More than 50 enemies arrived at Fuqiao on the 14th and landed at Qi Yaikou. They carried guns, cannons, and bullets and seemed to intend to be stationed there permanently. Many enemies arrived in Yuewang City at 10:00 a.m. on the 14th and robbed residents. They had the appearance of advancing westward. Official report 1: The enemy is currently concentrating dozens of armored vehicles in Zhabei and plans to occupy Nanshi after the peace talks break down. 2: The Japanese side of the Zhabei Pseudo-Local Maintenance Association intends to reorganize. The Japanese army stationed in Zhuangqian Village, about a mile west of the Huangdu Railway Station, has searched all the houses near the station and demolished the houses for fuel.</p>
<p>A special telegram from Kunshan on the 14th said that the Japanese army has been gathering a large army in Zhuangsi Village near Huangdu on the railway front since the 13th, parking them near the station, and demolishing houses and railway sleepers for fuel. Enemy armored vehicles and tanks were reportedly ordered to concentrate. A special telegram from Changshu on the 14th said that more than 50 enemies have arrived at Fuqiao again and appear to be stationed there permanently. The enemy searched the residents' belongings in Yuewang City at 10:00 a.m. today and had the appearance of advancing westward. The front line has been quite quiet for the past four days, and no gunshots have been heard so far. The enemy is probably deploying. A special telegram from Jiaxing on the 14th said that at 10:00 a.m. on the 14th, a twin-wing Japanese aircraft flew to Hebei to reconnoiter and circled in the airspace for more than ten minutes before leaving.</p>
<h3>The New Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Bell Elected Chairman and Annauer Vice Chairman</p>
<p>The City Federation and Other Groups Sent Letters to Contribute Opinions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession held a board meeting yesterday. At the same time, the new Chinese and Western directors officially took office and elected the chairman of the board. The City Federation and other groups sent letters to the board of directors yesterday to contribute opinions. The details of each item are recorded below.</p>
<p>Board Meeting The board meeting was held at the Municipal Council at 12:00 noon yesterday. The new Chinese and foreign directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lvdeng, Xu Xinliu, Liu Hongsheng, Hu Mengjia, Fukushima, Okamoto, Annauer, Bell, Leslie, Redo, McBain, Parson, Bain, and other fourteen people gathered to talk to each other. Bell was elected Chairman of the Municipal Council Board and Annauer was elected Vice Chairman. They officially took office at the same time, but there was no ceremony. Only at 1:30 p.m. when the meeting was adjourned, the whole group took a photo together.</p>
<p>Contribution of Public Opinion The City Federation, the Joint Federation of Business Circles on Various Roads, and the Trade Association of the Transfer, Customs Declaration, Woolen, and Factory Industries jointly affixed their seals on a letter to the Municipal Council Board yesterday, contributing their opinions, "Respectfully, the following signatory groups, all of whose members or the majority of whose members are taxpayers in the Public Concession, sincerely welcome the directors of your council to take office today and sincerely contribute their opinions to you. The opinions we contribute are completely based on the principles of the rule of law, cooperation, and prosperity of the Shanghai market, which are respected by the Municipal Council. We treat all of you equally and sincerely respect you. Today, you are standing in the position of presiding over the Municipal Council and exercising political power. The history of Shanghai from today onwards will be your responsibility. We sincerely hope that you will work hard for the history of Shanghai after April 14, 1932, so that every page of the historical record will be a fair text. Today, the outgoing board of directors will hand over the most difficult work in history to you. In this handover process, as far as we know, there are several matters that require your special attention: (1) Former Chairman Major General MacNaghten, because Japanese soldiers and Japanese armed civilians without any authority who are responsible for maintaining the security of the concession, have caused the municipal administration to stagnate and residents to panic in the eastern and western districts of Shanghai with illegal actions. Even the patrolmen employed by the Municipal Council to protect the safety of taxpayers were disarmed. On February 4, based on the spirit of his loyal duty, he sent a letter to the British Consul General to protest to the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. Although the police power has gradually returned to its original state, the residents of eastern Shanghai are still in a state of panic, causing the majority of merchants to be unable to open their businesses with peace of mind, the majority of residents are still avoiding living elsewhere, and the above-mentioned illegal actions have not been legally dealt with. Regarding this matter, it is your duty to continue to handle it to the best of your ability after the former Chairman Major General MacNaghten, so that the result will become the first page of valuable historical records during your tenure. (2) According to the report of the Missing Persons Investigation Unit of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department on March 7, the total number of missing persons is 807. Among these 807 people, 136 have been found, and 681 have not been found. According to the report, 474 people were arrested by the Japanese. In addition to the 71 people released by the Japanese, at least 403 people are still in detention. Based on the fact that as many as 214 people have been released by the Japanese and have not been reported missing, the number of people currently detained by the Japanese may be above 681. This situation is no different from residents being held by kidnappers and knowing the kidnappers' residences and names. In terms of responsibility, you should strive to rescue the abducted people from danger. In terms of the spirit of the rule of law, you should prosecute the Japanese who released the 71 people and punish them according to law. The result of this effort can also become a valuable historical record during your tenure. 3. The prosperity of Shanghai for 88 years, judging from the status of architecture and industry and commerce, has almost always had a tendency to progress every year. However, between January 28 and April 14, 1932, the tragic fact of special regression was discovered. Based on this fact, it is estimated that it will take ten years of cooperation for Chinese and Western people to do their best to restore the original state. Regarding this matter, you must solicit the opinions of Chinese and Western people and formulate a plan to restore Shanghai's prosperity in a number of years. During your one-year term, you should encourage Chinese and Western people to work together for it. 4. Although the work that you are accepting from the outgoing board of directors today is more difficult than in any other year, the planning for dealing with the incident is easier than for the outgoing board of directors. Because the outgoing board of directors had no incident like the one on January 28 of this year to provide a reference for planning and dealing with the environment. Now you have witnessed it before taking office and allowed you to clarify the difference between the British, American, and Italian troops and the Japanese troops. Because the British, American, and Italian troops are disciplined and can fulfill their responsibility of maintaining security, while the Japanese troops are not only undisciplined, but also do not know the explanation and meaning of maintaining security. Japanese soldiers have repeatedly declared that the purpose of sending troops to Shanghai is the same as that of the British, American, and Italian troops. Now, the facts prove that they are absolutely different. Therefore, we believe that this kind of declaration by Japanese soldiers is intentionally insulting the disciplined and responsible troops of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy, and we express our dissatisfaction on their behalf. Regarding this matter, we publicly expressed our opinion in the Dagong Bao on April 13, advocating the revision of the regulations of the Defense Force Committee and the abolition of the Japanese troops' right to joint defense from now on, in order to eliminate the concerns of destroying Shanghai's prosperity and the Municipal Council's police power. The opinions we contribute are prompted by our concern for Shanghai's prosperity and our love for the Municipal Council and our respect for you. We believe that it is fair to say that the Japanese directors among you may have unpleasant feelings because of this. However, we believe that if the Japanese directors understand the position they are standing on and the responsibilities they bear, they should abandon their national concepts and welcome our outspokenness. Because we are standing on the position of the Chinese people, although we are dissatisfied with the Japanese who do not abide by the law, we are also willing to give the same respect to the Japanese directors who are standing in the position of the Municipal Council directors as taxpayers, just as other Chinese people praise the Japanese peace-loving people who advocate non-war and oppose the invasion of our country by Japanese warlords. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all Japanese directors who are taking office today will accept our respect and assist other Chinese and Western directors in reducing the difficulties in handling the above matters, and advise the Japanese soldiers in Shanghai and the Japanese who do not know the law to change their attitude as soon as possible in order to preserve the honor of the Japanese nation in the world and among human beings. We have planned to study the plan for Shanghai's prosperity. If you do not consider our opinions to be unworthy and have the determination to strive to restore Shanghai's prosperity, we are very willing to contribute our research results to you at any time."</p>

<p>Above, this situation is actually no different from residents being held by kidnappers and knowing the kidnappers' addresses and names. In terms of responsibility, all of you should strive to rescue those who were kidnapped from danger. In terms of the spirit of the rule of law, you should file charges against the Japanese who released 71 people and punish them according to the law. The results of this effort can also become a historically valuable record during your term of office. 3. The prosperity of Shanghai over the past 88 years, judging by the condition of architecture, industry and commerce, has shown a trend of progress almost every year. However, between January 28, 1932 and April 14, 1932, there was a tragic fact of special regression. Judging from this fact, it is estimated by the general public that it will take ten years of collaboration for both Chinese and Westerners to exert their full efforts to restore the situation to its original state. Regarding this matter, you should solicit the opinions of Chinese and Western people widely and formulate a plan to restore Shanghai's prosperity over several years. During your one-year term, you should encourage Chinese and Western people to work together for this. 4. Although the work that you are accepting from the outgoing Board of Directors today is more difficult than in any year, the planning for dealing with this incident is easier than it was for the outgoing Board of Directors. This is because the outgoing Board of Directors did not have an incident like the events of January 28 this year to provide a reference for planning a response to the environment. Today you have witnessed it before taking office, and this has allowed you to see the difference between the troops of Britain, America, and Italy and the troops of Japan. This is because the troops of Britain, America, and Italy are all disciplined and able to fulfill their responsibilities to maintain order, while the Japanese troops are not only undisciplined, but they also do not understand the meaning or interpretation of maintaining order. Japanese soldiers have repeatedly declared that the purpose of deploying their troops to Shanghai is the same as that of the British, American, and Italian troops. Now, the facts prove that they are absolutely different. Therefore, we believe that this kind of declaration by Japanese soldiers is actually an intentional insult to the disciplined and responsible troops of Britain, America, and Italy, and we express our resentment on their behalf. Regarding this matter, we have publicly expressed our views in the Dagong Daily on April 13, advocating the revision of the regulations of the Defense Force Committee and the cancellation of the Japanese troops' right to joint defense from now on, in order to eliminate the concerns about destroying Shanghai's prosperity and the Municipal Council's police powers. The opinions we are contributing are motivated by our concern for Shanghai's prosperity, our love for the Municipal Council, and our respect for all of you. We believe that, fairly speaking, the Japanese directors among you may develop an unpleasant feeling because of this. However, we believe that if the Japanese directors understand the position they are standing on and the responsibilities they bear, they should abandon their nationalistic notions and welcome our outspokenness. Because we are standing on the side of the Chinese people, although we are dissatisfied with the Japanese who do not abide by the law, we are also willing to extend the same respect, in our capacity as taxpayers, to the Japanese directors who are standing in the position of Municipal Council directors, just as our people praise Japanese peace-loving people who firmly advocate non-war and oppose the invasion of our country by Japanese warlords. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all the Japanese directors who are taking office today will accept our respect and assist other Chinese and Western directors in reducing the difficulties in handling the above matters, and to advise the Japanese soldiers in Shanghai and the Japanese who do not know the law to change their attitudes as soon as possible, in order to preserve the honor of the Japanese nation in the world and among human beings. We have already planned to devote ourselves to studying a plan for the prosperity of Shanghai, and if you do not consider our opinions to be unworthy, and are determined to strive to restore Shanghai's prosperity, we are very willing to offer our research results to you at any time."</p>
<h3>Hongkou District Merchants and Residents Declare They Dare Not Open for Business</h3>
<p>Hoping All National Defense Forces Adopt a Fair Attitude</p>
<p>And Present the Municipal Government with Relief Measures</p>
<p>The Hongkou District branches of the Citizens' United Association, and various commercial organizations, etc., based on the resolutions of the recent general meeting, yesterday issued a declaration stating they dared not rashly open for business, and petitioned the government to provide relief measures. The declaration and petition are recorded below:</p>
<p>Issuing a Declaration The declaration is as follows: Japanese barbarism, occupying the Northeast, relying on their gunboats, advancing on Shanghai and Songjiang, seizing Zhabei. If the world has not lost its sense of justice, it is all filled with indignation, who does not share this anger? The Hongkou District is their stronghold, the concession authorities have no way to resist, only to entrust it to the national defense forces of concerned countries. From then on, the prosperous market is left to the cruel Japanese army to poison life and harm property, using every possible means to the extreme. Such trampling, is witnessed by Chinese and foreigners alike. Alas, the citizens of Hongkou, are under the iron heel of violence, industry and commerce have ceased, the market presents a scene of terror. Even today, if a door is opened, the Japanese army freely takes goods, even without paying a penny. In such a state, how can merchants dare to rashly open for business? How can they be able to live and work in peace? The former prosperous district has been transformed into a harsh environment. It is expected that the national defense forces of concerned countries have not fully performed their duties, leading to a situation where they are like snakes and wolves, acting freely, and losing the power to protect the concession. This is truly a heartbreaking and utterly helpless situation for the citizens of Hongkou. The existence of concessions in Shanghai depends on treaties, but Japan disregards the regulations, treating them as waste paper, allowing itself to do whatever it wants, further disregarding the common commercial port of all concerned countries, and all its prosperity, casting it aside. We are in the concession, which is originally Chinese territory, we should resolve to help each other and strive for self-preservation. In particular, we hope to urge the national defense forces of concerned countries to immediately take action, adopt a fair attitude, and seek a safe path for the Hongkou District, so that merchants can enjoy their work and people can live in peace. Then, survivors after the disaster, will still have a glimmer of hope. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>Presenting a Document to the Municipal Government Requesting the municipal government to provide relief measures, saying: The Japanese invaders are attacking Shanghai and Songjiang, advancing on Zhabei, trampling the entire territory, it can be said to have reached the extreme. The Hongkou area, called a concession, is actually our territory. Our country is a land of propriety and righteousness, strictly abiding by treaties. Who would have expected that the January 28th Incident would occur, and the national defense forces of concerned countries would also be unable to resist the Japanese army, allowing their poisonous snakes to make the Hongkou District their base camp, turning the once beautiful market into a violent and harsh environment. Even today, if one wants to open the door, the Japanese army freely acts, seizing goods, which is often heard. Before the safety of the citizens in Hongkou is guaranteed, how dare they rashly open for business? This is a matter of vital concern and deep suffering. Therefore, on the twelfth of this month, a meeting of representatives from various branches in the Hongkou District was convened, and it was publicly decided to address the issue of opening for business. The special circumstances of the Hongkou District should be addressed by requesting the Municipal Council to provide concrete guarantees to fulfill its duties. We implore the municipal government to grant us negotiations and relief plans to ensure safety. We hereby submit a document to your esteemed office, requesting your assessment of the situation and prompt consideration of measures to maintain this difficult situation, which is a matter of public concern.</p>

<h3>Zhang Yan Advocates Wartime Entertainment</h3>
<p>Zhang Yan, Deputy Division Commander and Brigade Commander of the 19th Route Army, believes that the Japanese attitude is tough and there is absolutely no sincerity in seeking peace. A major war is not far away. It is necessary to rectify the military and prepare for war to resist the powerful enemy. Two academic subjects are scheduled every day, and he personally supervises and actively trains them, sparing no effort. Furthermore, due to the lack of entertainment in the army and the monotonous life, a court was built near the garrison. After dinner every night, officers and soldiers are led to play volleyball and lion dances and other entertainment. There is a sense of awakening the sleeping lion and roaring on the mainland, which is also a rare and treasured event in the military.</p>
<h3>The "North-China Daily News" Reports on the Actions of a Military Police Officer One Day</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" yesterday (13th) published a letter from a person signing as "Resident of Zhabei", roughly stating: My home is near Baole'an Road. On the afternoon of Sunday, the 10th of this month, at about 1 p.m., I returned home to inspect the condition of my home and the surrounding area. When I was about to return after finishing my affairs, a person resembling a servant suddenly ran from a nearby house and told me, (at that time it was about 1:30 p.m.) that he was ordered by his master to hold a pass from the Municipal Council and accompany a maid and a servant girl to return home to fetch things. On the way, they encountered a Japanese military police officer, who went around with them. When they arrived home, the Japanese soldier ordered him to go outside. Just as he was leaving the door, he saw the Japanese soldier trick the maid and the servant girl into the room, fearing that there would be unexpected behavior, etc. I happened to remember that I had seen someone enter the alley and speak Japanese, and I felt that I could speak to the Japanese military police. Therefore, the servant and I returned to the house urgently. When we arrived, we heard sharp cries from inside the room. We thought that the military police had guns, and at this time, there was no other way but to call the patrolmen for help. Just as we were about to turn around, we suddenly saw the servant girl running out, shouting for help. We then went out together to find someone who could help us, and we saw two Japanese police officers walking north near the intersection of Baole'an Road and Yokohama Road. Fearing that they were compatriots and would be unfavorable to us, I hurried to Baole'an Road, with the servant and servant girl following behind. When we were about to reach the intersection of North Sichuan Road, I happened to turn around and saw the Japanese military police officer chasing after us with a gun. I rushed into North Sichuan Road and happened to see a rickshaw, so I hired it and fled. As for what happened to the maid, the servant girl, and the servant, I do not know.</p>
<h3>Hainan Road Area</h3>
<p>Removal of Lead Wire Mesh Wood Piles</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Zhabei, the area around North Zhejiang Road, Hainan Road, Avenue Edward VII, and the Boundary Road is not far from the front line. The public patrol house used barbed wire and wooden piles as obstacles, starting from the western end of Hainan Road near the border with the Chinese concession, and directly surrounding the area near the Xijin Guild Hall to the Boundary Road near the North Railway Station. All the shops were enclosed within it. Now that the area has been reported to be calm, yesterday afternoon, the public patrol house ordered workers to remove all the lead wire mesh to the iron gate at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII. The iron gate was also opened in both directions, so that the shops could move back and resume business. Some small shops have already opened for business. However, the iron gate ends at the Boundary Road, and the obstacles on the western side near the Chinese boundary remain. The sandbags at the intersection of Boundary Road and North Zhejiang Road block traffic, and pedestrians cannot go north. Many people stepped into the sandbag pits to explore the traces of the war around the North Railway Station. All kinds of miserable situations are truly hair-raising.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Red Cross Society Letter to Huang Jinrong Soliciting Donations</h3>
<p>Zhou Xuewen, Chairman of the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, to Shanghai Huang Jinrong, a great philanthropist, says: Jinrong, respected elder, greetings from afar. I have been thinking of you. I hope you are well. Recalling the Jiangzhe battles of the Jiazi year, the Wen Association and Mr. Lu Bohong collected comrades and established the Fifth Sanatorium and Refugee Shelter for women and children of the Songjiang Red Cross Society. At that time, we were assisted by the old uncle with much money, so we could complete the event without debt. I am deeply grateful and unforgettable. Recently, the violent Japanese have provoked incidents, burned Zhabei, and now extend to Jiading, Liuhe and Songjiang are near. The outbreak of war, the richest of them. Wen is in his duty, he can't sit idly by, so he gathered old comrades to set up a Red Cross Branch in Songjiang, which has been filed with the General Assembly. I was mistakenly promoted to chairman of the branch to handle the rescue of villagers and the treatment of wounded soldiers, as a guarantee for the rear. However, Songjiang has not recovered since the war, and the business situation is bleak, so it is difficult to take action in terms of economy. What's more, in the beginning, there was no money. I have repeatedly thought of asking the old man for help, but I am ashamed to ask. However, after thinking about it again and again, in today's world, the righteous and generous are able to think of people's needs. Aside from the old uncle, there is no one else. The so-called call to the heights, then the mountains will respond. This kind of undertaking, Xun has been promoted by the old uncle, and the donors will be enthusiastic. I respectfully send you a letter of appeal and appeal for extensive fundraising. I think that the enthusiastic people know that like the old uncle, they will definitely agree to the request. Wen Jin should pay homage to the wounded soldiers and refugees and thank them. Please be well, and wait for your reply. Nephew Zhou Xuewen respectfully.</p>
<h3>Boy Scouts Prepare to Recruit Steel Helmets</h3>
<p>The Boy Scout Battlefield Service Group plans to raise funds for steel helmets, with a target of 25,000 yuan (based on the cheapest price of 2.5 yuan per helmet, 10,000 helmets can be produced). The approach is to organize a fundraising committee, and to hire social figures to serve as supervisors, and famous accountants to serve as auditors. Various banks collect donations, and solicit designs, etc., which are actively underway. However, according to reporters who met with the person in charge of the rear office of the group yesterday, although the project is now planned to be held, the procedures are still under consideration. The rumor that a fundraising committee has been established is inaccurate and not a fact.</p>
<h3>Italian Aircraft Flew Over the Concession Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Citizens Mistakenly Thought It Was a Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that on Wednesday afternoon, an Italian seaplane, flown by two naval aviation officers, flew over the Public Concession. The Italian tricolor flag was hung on the plane. The plane flew from the Italian cruiser Trento, which was moored in the Huangpu River. After flying for a while, it returned to the original ship. This was the first time that an Italian aircraft had flown over Shanghai. Many Shanghai people who saw it for the first time thought it was a large Japanese naval aircraft, until they recognized that the flag on the aircraft was red, white, and green, then they realized their mistake.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Asks to Stop Landlords from Cutting Off Water</h3>
<p>Respect the Provisions of Item 5 of the Appendix to the Contract</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association yesterday sent a letter to the Director-General of the Municipal Council regarding the matter of landlords cutting off water, saying: Sir, we have received a letter from the United Association of Tenants inside and outside the Dongxi Huifang Lane on Fuzhou Road, stating that because the landlord Sun Bosheng is oppressing them with rent increases, they are negotiating and consulting with him. Sun Bosheng suddenly instructed the Water Company to cut off the water for daily use by all the tenants inside and outside the lane. According to Item C5 of the appendix to the contract signed by your council and the Water Company in 1928, (If the landlord pays the water bill, the Water Company shall not stop supplying water to the inhabited house at the landlord's request, but the landlord shall not refuse to pay the water bill for the house because the Water Company does not agree to his request). If the above report is true, this association believes that the act of cutting off water is inconsistent with the contract. We hereby request you to investigate and correct it in order to maintain the dignity of the contract.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Groups Continue to Run the Relief Association</h3>
<p>During the recent war in Shanghai, Guangdong people who were victims were previously handled by the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Relief Association, which provided funds from the Guangzhao Guild Hall to send them back to their hometowns in batches. Now the association has declared its end, but there are still more than 300 people who have no home to return to for a while, and they have all requested relief from the Guangzhao Guild Hall. The Guangzhao Guild Hall held a joint meeting with the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation the day before yesterday, and it was publicly decided that the Guild Hall and the Federation would continue to take over the matter, first setting up a place to accommodate them, and then gradually finding ways to provide funds to send them away, so as to avoid wandering.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Elementary School Remits Money to Comfort the Troops</h3>
<p>Zhang Fangbao, Yang Jiayao, Gong Zhenduo, Pi Jinzhang, Zhang Lie, Yang Qiao, Wei An, Li Guanghui, Hu Guodong, Zhong Zhenfan, Cai Xuetao, Deng Guojun, Luo Shijun, Ye Jinghua, Chen Zhenhua, Su Dehua, Liu Xichang, Ouyang Lin, Song Huayi, and all the teachers and students of the Jiangxi Yichun Provincial Seventh Middle School Experimental Elementary School, remitted 30 Shanghai dollars through the post office to donate to the 19th Army.</p>
<h3>Refugee Relief Association Begs for Single Clothes and Trousers for Refugees</h3>
<p>Too Hot to Change</p>
<p>Lice Breed Epidemics</p>
<p>The disaster victims from various places who are accommodated by the Refugee Relief Association in the war zone of this city, mostly fled in a hurry when the enemy soldiers invaded, supporting the old and carrying the young, so they did not have time to bring many clothes, resulting in a lack of clothes for replacement, and lice have been growing for a long time, which is detrimental to hygiene. The association had already noticed this and notified the heads of the various management to supervise the refugees to wash diligently, but in the past the weather was colder, and the refugees could still find ways to wash their inner clothes. Since the weather has gradually become hotter, single clothes are needed, and most of the clothes brought by the refugees are winter clothes, and the state of covering one's elbows is completely revealed. If single clothes are not issued, they will inevitably be unable to change them, and the sweat will be smoky, which will not only breed lice, but also easily cause epidemics. However, the association believes that the war is not ending soon, and most of the refugees cannot return to their hometowns. The cost of maintenance will still be huge in the future, so it is not possible to make new clothes for each of them. It has been advertised in the newspaper to solicit single clothes and trousers from all walks of life, regardless of whether they are men, women, young or old, new or old. Donations are welcome. It is heard that the receiving place is Renji Hall on Yunnan Road, 6th Malu.</p>
<h3>Measures for Paying Security Deposits for Customs Brokerage</h3>
<p>Designated Banks Collect on Behalf</p>
<p>The Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs previously promulgated 22 rules for the administration of customs brokerage firms in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance. Commissioner Luo notified everyone and set it to be implemented on February 1. Later, because of the regulations, all customs brokerage firms or factories should pay a security deposit of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, or a customs brokerage association should pay 200,000 yuan. The customs brokerage firms believed that there was no need to pay a security deposit in advance. The companies held meetings and decided to ask the customs to withdraw its order. The chairman of the association, Shi Zikun, was publicly recommended to meet with Commissioner Luo to discuss alternative methods. It was appropriate because of the Shanghai Incident and the delay has been until now. It is now heard that the customs has implemented this matter since March 1. However, the stone representative and Commissioner Luo agreed that all the colleagues who entered the customs brokerage association, a total of more than 200 households, would be allowed to raise 200,000 yuan in cash, and each household would be guaranteed by two companies in a circular. Due to the suspension of business to defend against insults, the market has gradually recovered recently. The customs has urged payment several times. After negotiation between the stone representative and the customs authorities, Zhejiang Xingye Zhejiang Industrial Siming Jincheng Four Banks were designated to collect the security deposits of the same industry. For those who have paid, the association will notify them, and the customs will allow them to report their business, otherwise they will be rejected. As for individual firms and factories, they must still pay the certificate fee of 2,000 to 5,000 yuan as usual.</p>
<h3>A Lot of Japanese Goods Imported</h3>
<p>A Large Number of Sick Japanese Soldiers Return Home</p>
<p>Since this month, there have been seven ships carrying Japanese goods to Shanghai, including cotton, sugar, cement, piece goods, soda, beer, rubber, etc., about 80,000 pieces, some of which were transferred to the Yangtze River. Yesterday, the Yamagata Maru arrived again, carrying 14,858 pieces of Japanese goods from Kobe, including cotton, machinery, white sugar, steam pipes, and flour. In addition, 714 tons of machinery and materials for the Shanghai Japanese yarn factory to prepare for resumption of operations were shipped by Yufeng Textile Factory.</p>
<p>Many Japanese soldiers stationed in Shanghai have been suffering from diseases recently, and it is difficult to treat them. In the past two days, Shirakawa and Nomura sent more than 700 seriously ill Japanese soldiers back to Japan for recuperation. The body of Japanese officer Major Kuga has been scheduled to be transported back to Japan on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Min People Telegraphically Request Strict Prohibition of Opium Public Sales by the Fujian Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Fellow villagers from the six counties of Jian Prefecture in Fujian who are traveling to Shanghai, because Fang Shengtao, etc., of the Fujian Provincial Government, publicly sell opium and poison the entire province, and the direct victims are the Yan, Jian, and Shao prefectures in northern Fujian, convened a meeting and resolved to telegraphically request the central government to stop the investigation. The original telegram reads: Chairman Lin of the Luoyang National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, President Yu of the Control Yuan, and Chairman Zhang of the National Opium Prohibition Committee, greetings. Our Fujian's opium ban has always been strict. Since the Republic of China, warlords have been in power, doing almost all kinds of evil. However, they did not dare to publicly sell opium. Unexpectedly, under the rule of the party, the Fujian Provincial Government, Acting Chairman Shengtao, etc., openly violated the world's disapproval and implemented the public sale of opium. It is heard that in addition to the undertaking organization, those who have been in Fujian for a long time with guns are given grades of fat. This kind of behavior not only violates the national ban, but also violates the legacy of the rural philosopher Lin Wenzhong. It also touches the special chapter on dereliction of duty in the criminal law. Reading the Shanghai and Xin reports of the 7th of this month, a special telegram from Fuzhou said that the Fujian Provincial Government decided on the 5th to cancel the public sale due to fierce opposition from all parties. Since it is said to be canceled, then the previous approval can be known. This kind of telegram, if it is true, must also be a plan to cover one's ears and steal the bell. Evidence is given in the Xiamen special telegram in the Shenxin report of the 9th, saying that the smoke sticks Ye Qinghe and others are secretly establishing a company and paying donations to sell pulp. Then, in fact, it has not been cancelled, which can be imagined. Moreover, last winter, the national opposition to the southern Fujian Le Planting Tobacco Seedlings, the Fujian Provincial Government also decided to implement the eradication, and promulgated several regulations prohibiting planting, which is well-known in the ears of the people, and judging from the facts, the collection of pulp is as usual, and the tax is also as usual. Today's decision to cancel the public sale will be different. The association humbly represents the people of Fujian and pleads for orders. We implore your government and court to examine and verify the public sale of opium in Fujian and to appoint appropriate personnel to thoroughly investigate it in order to clarify the truth. On one side, a special decree is issued to strictly prohibit it in order to extend the national law and eliminate the scourge of opium. The meeting of fellow villagers from the six counties of Jian Prefecture in Fujian is eager to wait for orders. Steam,</p>
<h3>The Anti-Drug Association Drafts a Smoke Prohibition Plan for the Qiongya District</h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Chao, the chief executive of the Qiongya Special District in Guangdong, has just taken office. In view of the fact that many people in the district are addicted to opium, he plans to strictly prohibit smoking in order to eliminate the harm to the people. Because he heard that the Anti-Drug Association has been studying the issue of smoking prohibition for many years, he specially sent a letter to the association's chief executive, Huang Jiawei, yesterday, requesting him to draft a smoking prohibition plan for the Qiongya District. The letter said: Mr. Jiawei, I have been ordered to head Qiong and have already taken office in Guangzhou. I will go to Qiong to take office in the near future. I heard that many people in the Qiong District are addicted to opium. The local government in the past was unable to ban it due to financial relations. I plan to sacrifice this income after taking office and try to ban smoking and transportation, and strive to eliminate it all within six months. However, the Qiong District is surrounded by the sea, and there is a lot of smuggling, so it is difficult to start the investigation. As for the prohibition of smoking, it seems that punishment and persuasion should be used at the same time, and a method of quitting should be prepared for addicts in advance, so that it can be effective. I have made up my mind to ban smoking in the Qiong District. I have long admired your enthusiasm for anti-drug and your outstanding reputation. I dare to send a letter to ask you to plan for me how to prevent transportation and eliminate the source, and how to prevent smoking and eliminate hidden dangers. In addition, if there are any detailed instructions on smoking cessation equipment and detoxification drugs, (excerpt) I respectfully send you a special letter and wish you all the best. It is heard that the association has replied to do so. However, because Qiongya is an island in Guangdong, all situations are different from other places. It specially solicited people from the district who are traveling to Shanghai to come to the meeting to discuss together and to prepare for consultation.</p>
<h3>Hubei Fellow Villagers Telegraphically Congratulate Chairman Xia</h3>
<p>The Hubei Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Hubei Provincial Government, saying: Chairman Xia and all the members and directors of the Hubei Provincial Government in Wuchang, greetings. This reorganization of the Hubei Provincial Government is a great joy for the people of Hubei to have someone in charge of the government. I have heard that you have taken the oath of office on the 11th of the month. Looking forward to the festival, I am very happy. Although Duke Ling has long been in charge of the military talisman, he usually cares about the people's suffering. The vigilance in Wuhan is also a testament to the continuation of governance. You are all scholars of the time, and your morality and studies are outstanding in Haibing. You have long been admired by the villagers. Unfortunately, our Hubei has suffered from natural disasters and man-made disasters. In addition, the government is corrupt and hundreds of policies have not been implemented. Although it is a difficult time, it is also a lack of human planning. Fortunately, you are in charge of the rural country, and you must have insight into the people's suffering and the advantages and disadvantages of politics. In the future, the facilities will be able to cooperate sincerely, express your plans together, and gradually reach a prosperous rule, so as to comfort the hopes of Yunni. I respectfully send you a telegram to congratulate you. I hope you will pay attention to it. The Hubei Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Jiang Lun Will Not Temporarily Increase Shallow Water Fees</h3>
<p>Each wheel company such as China Merchants, Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, Ning Shao, and Sanbei in this port, gathered a few days ago to discuss the shallow water fees added last winter in Jiujiang and Hankou. As the river water has now risen, it was decided to cancel it from tomorrow (16th). At the same time, the freight for goods shipped from Shanghai to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, etc., has been increased by 30% of the original price. It has been recorded in the previous newspaper. It is now heard that the six companies met yesterday. Regarding the increase in Yangtze River freight, due to the current sluggish business, it was decided to temporarily increase it. Therefore, the customs brokerage houses were notified to cancel the previous agreement. However, the shallow water fees in Jiujiang and Hankou will still be cancelled from tomorrow (16th) as before.</p>
<h3>Chengdu Wheel Comes to Shanghai After Danger</h3>
<p>Departed for Niuzhuang This Year</p>
<p>Taikoo Yixing Chengdu Wheel took the route from Niuzhuang to Shantou to Shanghai this time. It was reported earlier (11th) that it ran aground in the sea off Fuzhou Bay. It is now learned that the company's Dean Wheel immediately went to the rescue after passing through the area. It was soon out of danger. Dean Wheel still sailed to Hong Kong, and Chengdu Wheel arrived in Shanghai at about 7 am yesterday. The wheel was undamaged, but it will sail to Niuzhuang this afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Pond Construction Committee Begins Work</h3>
<p>When the Jiangnan Pond Construction Committee was established the day before yesterday, Niu Tiansheng was appointed as the chairman. However, Mr. Niu was in Luo due to official business and was unable to return to Shanghai for a while. Yesterday, Mayor Wu and Director Dong of the Jiangsu Construction Department agreed to hire Shen Chang, a member of the Huai River Guidance Committee, as a member of the Pond Construction Committee and Secretary-General, to be stationed at the meeting at all times to discuss with Vice Chairman Mu Ouchu the affairs of ponds in Baoshan, Songjiang, Taicang, Chuansha, Nanhui, Jinshan, six counties, and Shanghai urban areas. It was also decided to borrow a part of the municipal government's houses in Fenglinqiao as an office from today to start work, so that the pond construction can be completed before the major flood. It is also heard that the association is scheduled to hold its second committee meeting on the 18th to discuss the outline of construction.</p>
<h3>News from Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Recent News on Labor Relief in Northern Jiangxi: The National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee has received a telegram from Xi Dejiong, Director of the Labor Relief Office, dispatched from Xunyang, stating that he recently inspected 25 miles of dikes and embankments along the Gan River in northern Nanchang. The first phase of the project is 85% complete. If work continues, it is hoped that spring floods in this area can be prevented. Local people are satisfied with the completion of the dike project. However, all project costs need to be settled, and the Disaster Relief Committee is currently facing financial difficulties in raising funds. Xi left Xunyang for Hankou the day before yesterday to meet with Sir Simpson, Vice-Chairman of the committee, to discuss all matters.</p>
<p>Situation of Urgent Relief in Northern Anhui: The Huai River area in northern Anhui has suffered the most severe disaster. Due to inconvenient transportation in the area, the delivery of American wheat is difficult, and relief efforts have been delayed. Recently, the American Advisory Committee on Disaster Relief in China generously allocated 150,000 yuan in national currency to assist the National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee in carrying out relief work in northern Anhui. The Northern Anhui Disaster Relief Joint Association was established, with its general office in Bengbu. Six counties with more severe disaster situations were selected for urgent relief, with each county receiving between 12,500 yuan and 37,500 yuan. It is estimated that there are still two months before the harvest season. During this period, the disaster-stricken people are focusing all their efforts on cultivation, and labor relief cannot be implemented. Without clothing and food, they must rely on urgent relief to temporarily survive. Sir Simpson greatly admired this righteous act of the American Advisory Committee on Disaster Relief in China.</p>
<h3>Second Special District Court Burns Confiscated Narcotics</h3>
<p>Since its establishment on August 1st of last year, the Second Special District Court of Shanghai, Jiangsu, has, in accordance with agreements between Chinese and French commissioners, burned all seized opium, opium substitutes, and related paraphernalia such as pipes and lamps from the district's illegal sales and use every three months. The first batch of opium and related paraphernalia seized by the patrol in the three months of August, September, and October was burned on November 14th of last year on the vacant lot next to the east side of the court. The second batch, confiscated from November of last year to the end of March this year, a period of five months, has accumulated in the contraband storage.

<h3>First Special District Court Under Heavy Guard to Try 49 Robbers</h3>
<p>Committed Dozens of Robberies</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Feng Questions Each Case Individually</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the First Special District Court of Shanghai tried a large group of robbers, taking extraordinary security precautions. Armed Chinese and Indian patrol officers were temporarily stationed at the court entrance, and all visitors were carefully checked. At 1:30 PM, the Zhabei Patrol Station transported 49 male and female robbers in large prison vans, including Sun Honggui, Jiang Dexing, Zhou Xuehai, Wang Zixiang, Pan Guoliang, Xu Changgui, Ji Acai, Li Buwen, Deng Changlong, Li Jinfang, Xin Fayu, Gong Litang, Cao Jinbao, Cheng Chuansheng, Chen Dejin, Hang Ruiting, Chen Qiyou, Pan Huanzhang, Xu Jiahe, Wu Asan, Xu Weixin, Wang Zaiqiu, Wang Quanshi, Lü Ruicheng, Han Xiaolong, Xu Yulin, Xu Guangzhong, Sun Qiyou, Lin Shihua, Gu Zhiheng, Zhou Dafeng, Mao Laohu, Yang Yongsheng, Xu Maokun, Xu Yueming, Gong Sangong, Wang Amao, Li Zhitian, Yao Jinfu, Yan Wenbiao, Li Maotang, Chen Dexing, Cao Zilin, Ding Xiaodi, Qi Zengfu, Shen Tongnan, Wang Yinlin, Wang Zhangshi, and Yang AGen. More than a dozen defense lawyers hired by the robbers, including E Sen, Fan Gang, Jiang Yiping, Sun Yuan, and Bao Zhenhuang, and the Patrol Station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, arrived at the court's Second Criminal Division one after another. Since there were not enough seats for the lawyers, several additional seats were added to accommodate them. The court's internal security was extremely strict, and no one unrelated to the case was allowed to enter except for journalists. This group of robbers, captured recently by Chinese and Western detectives from the Zhabei Patrol Station, originally numbered 59. After legal investigation, 10 innocent individuals were released, leaving 49 accused of committing dozens of armed robberies. Presiding Judge Feng Shide, for the sake of facilitating the proceedings and clarifying the details, questioned each case individually. When hearing case A, only those involved in case A were brought to the courtroom, while those not involved in the case remained in the waiting room to avoid confusion. The court began hearing cases at 2:30 PM and continued until dusk, only hearing three or four cases, including illegally possessing handguns and robbing residents of Siwenli on Datong Road. Due to time constraints, the remaining cases were adjourned for further hearing. All defendants, except for three female prisoners detained in the court's women's prison, were returned to the Patrol Station in prison vans, and the court's security was lifted.</p>
<h3>City Tenants Association Requests Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Tenants General Association submitted a document to the municipal government stating: "We hereby petition for the promulgation of a clear order to reduce rents in order to provide relief. Our association has repeatedly received requests from tenants in the city and reports from tenants associations in the alleys, stating that they are being oppressed by landlords who use external force to compel them, leaving them helpless. Several such cases occur daily, and they request a solution to alleviate the situation. Letters are pouring in like snowflakes, all stating that during this Japanese invasion of Shanghai, emotions are high, and everyone is united in resisting the enemy. All industries have been halted, and life is especially difficult. This is an unprecedented disaster. At this extraordinary moment, business is depressed beyond description. Both businesses and residents have suffered immense losses, and income and expenses have become a major problem. To maintain the stability of the city and alleviate the suffering of the citizens, there is no better way than to reduce rents. During this national crisis, landlords are not affected, while tenants are bearing heavy losses. It is necessary to uphold fairness and help citizens renting houses to alleviate their suffering. Now it is a special zone, hailed as a safe area. Although businesses have reopened, trade is sluggish, as one can imagine. The two concessions are close to the war zone, only a stone's throw away, and everyone knows they are affected. This city (including Nanshi) has been dealt a heavy blow, and the plight of citizens is worsening. Tenants throughout the city are making this miserable appeal, a request in accordance with regulations, hoping to share the losses caused by the war and apply the principles of financial adjustment and fairness. For landlords, it only means a reduction in current profits, while for tenants, it can maintain their precarious situation. We should adhere to the principle of helping each other in times of difficulty and make this unavoidable request. We implore your government to consider the suffering of the people, save the commoners from danger, and issue a clear order to reduce rents. Except for Hongkou and the war zone, which should be completely exempt, all areas within the city limits, adjacent to the war zone, close to it, including Nanshi and the special zones within the two concessions, must uniformly reduce rent by half to maintain the security of the city and avoid rental disputes. We also request that you consult with all courts under your jurisdiction and, before a decision on rent reduction is made, handle cases of rent arrears and eviction notices leniently, in order to alleviate the people's suffering and provide relief. We earnestly request your government to review and approve the people's requests, and we are deeply grateful. We also request instructions for our compliance." (Remainder omitted)</p>

<h3>Truck Crashes into Tailor Shop, Apprentice Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Western Patrolman Oversteps Authority and Seizes Criminal</p>
<p>Sixth District Lodges Reasonable Representation</p>
<p>Yesterday (14th) at approximately 1:10 PM, a tragic accident involving a truck occurred on Yidingpan Road, which is a road built by the Municipal Council beyond its boundaries, in the western suburbs of Shanghai. A Western patrolman overstepped his authority by seizing the criminal, infringing upon China's sovereignty. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the Tragic Accident</h3>
<p>Yidingpan Road, next to South Bai Li Nan Road in Caojiadu in the western suburbs of Shanghai, is one of the roads built beyond the boundaries by the Municipal Council. The residents' houses along the road belong entirely to the Chinese area. Therefore, District Chief Ren of the Sixth District is responsible for the security of the residents along the road and provides thorough protection. Yesterday at approximately 1:10 PM, a truck with Shanghai Municipal Council registration number 3740 and Concession registration number 13559 was speeding south. The driver was careless, and the truck veered onto the sidewalk and crashed into a tailor shop at number 28, facing east. At that time, Sun Jingxiang (17 years old, local), an apprentice at the nearby Zhu Sen Tai paint shop, was passing in front of the shop after going out to buy kerosene. He was knocked down by the truck, rolled under the wheels, and thrown into the shop, resulting in immediate death. His internal organs were crushed, and his entire body was covered in blood, a gruesome sight. The shop floor was covered in blood. Pang Qu Shi (31 years old, local), the wife of the owner of the neighboring bamboo shop, was also knocked to the ground and seriously injured, barely breathing. The shop's glass windows, counter, iron cart, workbench, and pillars were all damaged. At that time, Meng Dingchen, a police officer of the Sixth District, happened to be passing by on duty and witnessed the tragedy. He immediately arrested the truck driver, Zhu Changqing, and reported the incident to the station.</p>
<h3>Western Patrolman Interferes Beyond Authority</h3>
<p>District Chief Ren Receives Report</p>
<p>Since the incident involved a death, District Chief Ren immediately ordered the police officer to take the driver, Zhu Changqing, back to the scene of the accident and to quickly send the injured woman to the police hospital for treatment. He also ordered that the truck be driven to the district. However, when the police officer arrived at number 28, a Western patrolman, number 340, from the Jing'an Temple Patrol Station, without asking any questions, aggressively stepped forward and arrested the driver, Zhu Changqing. The police officer found him unreasonable and barbaric in interfering beyond his authority, and returned to the station to report the incident. Shortly after, the Patrol Station sent another car to take away the body and the injured woman.</p>
<h3>Details of the Negotiation</h3>
<p>Since the apprentice died inside the number 28 shop and the injured woman was knocked down inside the shop, and the shop's windows, house, and belongings were all damaged, it was clear that the incident occurred in the Chinese area. Moreover, the police authority on roads built beyond the boundaries should be exercised by Chinese police. Therefore, the main suspect in the case should be brought back for punishment. He immediately sent Inspector Xu to the Jing'an Temple Patrol Station to negotiate, requesting that the driver, Zhu Changqing, be returned. However, the head of the Western patrolmen refused to hand over the criminal, insisting that the road was built by the Municipal Council and should be managed by the Patrol Station. Inspector Xu's repeated explanations were ineffective, and he had to return to the district to report.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Further Negotiation</h3>
<p>District Chief Ren, finding the Patrol Station to be so barbaric, personally went to the scene of the accident to inspect it and ordered a photograph to be taken. He also summoned the shop owner, Zhu Yongbing of Zhu Sen Tai, and Pang Meixue, the husband of the injured woman, to the district for questioning. At the same time, he reported the details of the incident to the Bureau Chief for instructions and would negotiate again, insisting on bringing back the criminal and punishing him according to the law.</p>

<h3>Yang Zhifu, the Comprador Who Kidnapped the Netherlands Bank, Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>No Last Words Before Execution</p>
<p>Only Asked for a Feast of Wine and Meat</p>
<p>Yang Kuihou, the comprador of the Netherlands Bank, lived at the northern end of Old Garbage Bridge. On January 10th of the 19th year of the Republic, he was kidnapped by bandits on Yunnan Road. Subsequently, Lu Liankui, the chief detective of the General Patrol Station's Investigation Department, and detectives Liu Shaokui and Tang Jian, arrested the bandit Yang Zhifu (also known as Liu Zhongyi and Liu Axi), a native of Yangzhou, age 40, at 149 Huishan Road. He was sent to the First Special District Court, where he was found guilty and sentenced to death, and the report was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. Yesterday was the execution date. The Patrol Station escorted Yang to the court at approximately 9:00 AM. The executing judge, Jiang Hechun, ascended to the bench and informed Yang that today was the day of execution and asked if he had any last words. Yang said he had no last words, only asking for a feast of wine and meat was enough. Judge Jiang ordered him sent to the local court for execution. Chinese and Western detectives took Yang down, along with the case files and photographs, and escorted him in a car directly to the Caohejing execution grounds. They also notified the local court to send a prosecutor to accompany the executing officers to the scene to re-examine Yang, verify his identity, bind him according to law, and execute him by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Notice Seeking Claimants for Body Killed by Train</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau reported from the Third Precinct of the Sixth District that on April 7th at 11:00 PM, a male body was found next to the railway tracks at Longhua Station, killed by a train. The male body was estimated to be about 50 years old, wearing a short black cotton-padded jacket and trousers made of imitation Zhigong wool, with a flannel undershirt, black shoes, and black socks. He appeared to be a peddler. His skull was fractured, and his brains had flowed out, with bloodstains obscuring his face and making it unidentifiable. It was determined that he was injured and killed by a train before his death. It was also found that the male body was carrying eight silver dollars, four dollars and thirty cents in banknotes, seventeen steel coins, and a hawker's license from the concession, bearing the name Shao Wenzhi. It is impossible to determine whether this was the name of the deceased. In addition to reporting to the court to send personnel to examine the body, the results of the investigation are being reported. Please review and approve.</p>

<h3>Li Pang, Expert in Bibliography and Textual Criticism, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

Among them, several types of Nestorian scriptures from the Daqin era are particularly valuable, all of which have never been seen by scholars around the world.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news item in your newspaper's news column on the 12th of this month about hooligans in Lao Bai Du, Pudong, openly extorting money from law-abiding citizens, we were greatly shocked. We went to the police station in charge to inquire and found that no such case had occurred. We also visited the address to interview the victim, but no one admitted to being extorted. It is clear that this is inaccurate. Since this is greatly related to the reputations of individuals, we would like to ask you to publish this letter in the correction column to uphold justice.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shen Ruizhi</p>

<p>Aggressive Japan Obviously Opposes Disarmament</p>
<p>Presents the So-Called Security Guarantee Issue Separately</p>
<p>Most National Representatives Support the American Proposal</p>
<p>If There is No Good Faith in the World</p>
<p>Please Return to Your Respective Countries to Prepare for War</p>
<p>Warning Words From the Italian Representative</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 13th Telegram</p>
<p>As a result of the general discussion by the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference in the past three days, according to the opinions of people in the League of Nations, the American plan to abolish all aggressive weapons is gaining momentum, while the position advocated by France is gradually weakening. Today, the Italian representative Grandi first opposed the French proposal and strongly refuted the impropriety of several reasons against the American proposal mentioned in Taydio's speech, saying that if a country violates the Kellogg-Briand Pact and attacks another country, it will inevitably feel that it does not need to be bound by self-restraint clauses and may use bombers and other aggressive weapons. Grandi's most warning words in his speech were that if one first holds the view that there is no good faith in the world, it would be better to abandon all hope of obtaining practical contraction results and return to one's country to prepare for war. At that time, the whole venue was filled with applause. Finally, Grandi reiterated Italy's advocacy of abolishing all cannons, tanks, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, and chemical weapons. Subsequently, the representatives who succeeded Grandi on stage to give speeches mostly agreed with the Italian or American proposals. Turkish Foreign Minister Lusht and the Persian representative both supported the American proposal and proposed that the manufacture of military aircraft bullets should be placed under international management, which would be the best way to abolish aggressive weapons. The Brazilian representative also agreed with the American proposal, but Uruguay supported the French international army plan, as did Yugoslav Prime Minister Marinkovic. The speech by Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski never mentioned the French plan, which was considered strange by those who heard it. It is expected that it was probably due to France's Danube plan and the rejection of certain Polish financial requests that angered the Poles. The Japanese representative Matsudaira's final speech strongly emphasized the necessity of establishing appropriate security guarantees, and said that the security of a country is not only threatened by the superior military power of other countries, but also the unsatisfactory state of affairs in neighboring countries is also a threat to security. After Matsudaira's speech, the General Committee adjourned and will reopen on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Ozaki Yukio, a famous Japanese politician, left Japan last autumn and went to Europe to inspect the political circles of various countries. Ozaki gave a speech at the luncheon of the London Association today on the issue of the Sino-Japanese dispute, saying, roughly, that the Geneva Disarmament Conference turning war into a humanitarian act is no different from turning murder into humanitarianism. In the current Sino-Japanese dispute, the attitude adopted by Japan is no different from the attitude of European and American countries if they were in the same position. In the past twenty years, China has continued to provoke the Japanese people. The League of Nations misunderstood its measures, which enabled Japanese militarists to realize their desires. European and American countries should be responsible for the current situation.</p>
<p>Japan Sends New Note to England</p>
<p>Regarding the Issue of the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>England Strictly Maintains Confidentiality</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, London, 13th Telegram</p>
<p>When members of the House of Commons asked about the general situation in the Far East this afternoon, Conservative Party member Knox asked whether China had clearly stated that it did not want to negotiate issues such as boycotts or anti-foreign actions or the safety of Shanghai. He also asked whether a clear statement by the British government that it intends to negotiate the future of Shanghai based on the Lytton Report would greatly help the current negotiators move towards a peaceful position. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden replied that such questions should be answered at a later date. Eden continued that if the opposition to Dr. Gu Weijun's visit to the three eastern provinces is not properly resolved, then the matter should be handled by the Executive Council of the League of Nations, not the British government. Labour Party member Cox asked a question that many considered extremely important. Cox asked about the content of Japan's communication on the application of the League of Nations Charter to the issue of the three eastern provinces, and asked what measures the British government had taken in response to this communication. Eden replied that Foreign Secretary Simon was unable to announce the content of the Japanese communication because it was of a confidential nature. The Foreign Secretary was also unable to make any comments on the measures taken by the British government in response to this.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Labour Party member Cox inquired in the House of Commons about Japan's communication regarding the application of the League of Nations Charter to the issue of the three eastern provinces. Today, various parties inquired about it but were unable to discover anything about the content. According to a telegram from Geneva, the British delegation there was completely unaware of this matter. It is reported that yesterday, Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden stated in the House of Commons that Foreign Secretary Simon was unable to announce the content of the Japanese communication because it was of a confidential nature.</p>
<p>German President Orders the Dissolution of the Nazi Army</p>
<p>Armed Police Strictly Enforce</p>
<p>This Move is to Eliminate Domestic Division</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 13th Telegram</p>
<p>The German government issued an urgent order today to dissolve Hitler's private army of 400,000 men, designating it as an illegal organization that harms national authority. The order was signed by Hindenburg and countersigned by Prime Minister Brüning and Defense Minister Groener. This move is a major blow to Hitler and the National Socialist Party. Previously, the police had seized documents, which reportedly proved that the National Socialist Party was preparing terrorist acts and plotting to overthrow the government. Therefore, the government is taking this severe measure and is confident that it can dissolve this shock troop without causing disturbances. However, if there is resistance, the government will severely punish it. After the order is announced, members of the National Socialist Party are not allowed to join the shock troop, and all offices and barracks of the shock troop must be confiscated. They are also not allowed to wear uniforms. The President's dissolution of the shock troop is in accordance with the constitution, which authorizes the President to implement plans to restore order and may use force when public safety is endangered. The order stated that government personnel unanimously advocated the dissolution of the military organization of the National Socialist Party. Anyone who still joins this organization will be subject to at least one month of imprisonment. It also said that the existence of such groups will create a situation equal to domestic war. The government is determined to actively intervene with all its methods to eliminate actions that could lead to domestic division and is confident that the majority of the people will support the government's move. This order does not hinder the National Socialist Party itself. The party still has the freedom to act and is the same as other political parties. According to a Reuters telegram from Cologne, the police in the Rhineland and Westphalia are now implementing this order, sealing off the military organs of the National Socialist Party and confiscating their documents. Currently, no riots have occurred anywhere. Another telegram said that the execution of the emergency order was unexpected by the National Socialist Party members everywhere. There was only resistance in a few places, such as Hamburg. The police there saw that the National Socialist Party office was filled with tear gas, so they first opened the windows and doors before entering. A total of five people have been arrested. The National Socialist Party claimed that the police search exceeded the scope, not only sealing off the barracks of the shock troop, but also sealing off the political offices of the National Socialist Party, arresting members of the party in the National Assembly and the state parliaments, and confiscating the party's election supplies.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 14th Telegram</p>
<p>The government's treatment of the National Socialist Party with lightning speed caught the party off guard. The police searched the offices and barracks of the shock troops, and all military supplies were confiscated, including an airplane. They only encountered very weak resistance. The public was initially afraid that the government's implementation of this measure could not succeed without bloodshed, but now they are relieved. Currently, only Brunswick has not taken any search actions. The Minister of the Interior of that state, Klagges himself, is also a radical member of the National Socialist Party and has succumbed to the government's orders to dissolve the shock troops. The National Socialist Party is now consoling itself, saying that the government's aggressive actions will allow the party to gain more votes in future elections.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 14th Telegram</p>
<p>Hitler issued a declaration this morning, advising his former shock troop comrades to continue to obey the command of their teams and their leaders in order to engage in the re-election campaign for the Prussian parliament.

<p>South American Volcanic Eruption Gradually Subsiding</p>
<p>May be Followed by Severe Earthquake</p>
<p>Residents Still Unable to Claim Safety</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th Telegram</p>
<p>According to Reuters telegrams from various parts of South America, the hidden worries in South America have not yet ended. Argentine volcano expert Professor Mana predicted today that within half a month after the volcanic eruption, there will be a severe earthquake. Therefore, the residents who have suffered hardship and are now feeling temporarily stable in the slight cessation of the flames will not be in a truly safe situation in the next half month. Those who took a plane to inspect the volcanic area on Sunday returned saying that there was no way to inspect. However, Chilean aviation officers returned yesterday and said that the most dangerous Quetrupillan volcano in Chile has gradually calmed down. Ash, like rain, mostly fell along the Argentine border, especially in Mendoza Province, where tens of thousands of vineyards were buried in ash. According to experts, the volcanic eruption is not without use, because volcanic ash is a harmless substance, and it is extremely useful for manufacturing cement and other things. The people in the disaster area are now calm, and trains are running as usual.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>Japanese University Professor Discusses the Pros and Cons of Leaving the League of Nations</p>
<p>Dr. Kamikawa and Kisaburo Yokota Oppose Leaving for Reasons Including Hampering Japan</p>
<p>Said That the United States and Russia, Which Are Not Members of the League of Nations, Are Hampering Japan</p>
<p>Since the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents occurred one after another, Japan relied on its military power to act wilfully, causing international public opinion of Japan to worsen day by day. Japan knew that its environment was unfavorable, so it even sang the theory of withdrawing from the League of Nations, vainly attempting to act freely. Little did they know that this was the act of simple-minded military warlords who did not know what politics and law were. As a result, it aroused the attack of scholars in that country, the debate was boiling, and criticisms arose, condemning those who advocated withdrawing from the League of Nations for lacking common sense and disregarding national interests. Among them, the opinions expressed by Dr. Kamikawa, professor of law at the Imperial University, and Kisaburo Yokota are sufficient to represent general public opinion in Japan. The translations are as follows:</p>
<p>Dr. Kamikawa's Article</p>
<p>The Provisional General Assembly of the League of Nations on May 1 is about to be convened. Currently, the theory of our country advocating withdrawal from the League of Nations is very loud. However, whether to withdraw or not is a fundamental issue of foreign policy and a major key to judging our country's destiny. In other words, it is a major transitional period in our country's history. Therefore, our country, from top to bottom, must carefully consider it and not fall into a state of eternal damnation. According to my (Kamikawa's) humble opinion, withdrawing from the League of Nations is not only unreasonable, but will also put us in a desperate situation. As for the reasons held by those who advocate withdrawing from the League of Nations today, there is fundamentally no room for discussion. Because our country's foreign policy can be divided into three ways: (1) Following the ancient tradition, striving for expansion and development in the continental direction. This is called the continental expansion policy. (2) Utilizing our country's geographical position, wanting to be the king of the Pacific, conquering the waves of the Pacific, and grasping the bull's ear of the Pacific maritime power. This is called the Pacific hegemony policy. (3) Abiding by the League of Nations covenant, conforming to the trend of international coordination, seeking political and economic cooperation, and working with the whole world to increase political, economic, cultural, and other welfare. This is called the international coordination policy. These three policies have long been the past experience of our country and are also the future policies that should be adopted and implemented urgently. Because the continental policy is the foundation of our country's foreign activities since ancient times. From ancient times to the end of the World War, our country's diplomacy was implemented in accordance with the continental policy. Based on this policy, the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars were promoted, and Korea and Ryukyu were resolved. At the same time, Southern Manchuria was also within our sphere of influence. This was the first step in the success of the continental policy. Later, when the World War occurred, the European and American powers who had been competing in East Asia had no time to look east. Our continental policy again encountered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Originally hoping to act freely in East Asia, but at that time, due to the rise of democracy and the trend of national self-determination and overthrowing militarism, the great opportunity was suddenly missed. The World War ended, and the League of Nations appeared. Our continental policy could not be developed again. However, our country, having excluded Russia's plan to enter East Asia, gradually progressed and poured its attention into the Pacific. However, the islands in the Pacific were occupied by European and American powers, and the maritime power in the Pacific was also in the hands of others. Therefore, our island nation in the Pacific greatly developed the navy and built merchant ships, and was able to gallop in the Pacific. However, before and after the war, conflict with Russia developed on the continent, and confrontation with the United States developed in the Pacific. The situation in all directions became increasingly tense. At the Washington Conference, our Pacific policy came to a halt again. At this time, because the League of Nations was established, our country's foreign policy changed with the times. Especially due to the rise of national self-determination and the trend of overthrowing imperialism, our country's continental policy and Pacific policy were greatly hit. However, our country, in this new era, had to follow the trend and adopt an international coordination policy. Today, our country is a permanent member of the League of Nations and occupies an important position in the League of Nations. However, since the war for more than ten years, the implementation of this international coordination policy has completely failed to achieve results, and the people's livelihood is in increasing danger. Therefore, it is desired to change the continental policy again in order to advance the country's fortune. However, at this time, whether our country should withdraw from the League of Nations should be carefully studied in terms of our country's policy towards Manchuria and the theoretical form of the League of Nations. Only then can a decision be made. If our country's policy towards Manchuria is determined to be realized, then in any case, it will not be possible to maintain the harmony of the principles of the League of Nations. As a result, there will be no other way but to withdraw from the League of Nations. If our country's theoretical form of policy towards Manchuria can be accommodated in the covenant of the League of Nations, then there is no need to withdraw. However, whether our country's policy towards Manchuria can be harmonized with the covenant of the League of Nations is still a question. Originally, our country's policy towards Manchuria followed two major principles: First, no third country is allowed to establish political or territorial hegemony in Manchuria. Second, we must prevent a third country from establishing an economically superior position. These two major principles were originally the fundamental principles of the past continental policy and will also be the policy to be implemented towards Manchuria in the future. If we want to implement these two major principles, then the only way is to annex Manchuria, or make Manchuria like Korea, subject to our political control, or divide the political territory of Manchuria with China and Russia, or make Manchuria an independent country and a buffer zone between China, Russia, and Japan. Among these methods, none is compatible with the principles of the League of Nations. Because the League of Nations rejects aggressors, the League of Nations will never recognize any country that conquers Manchuria. If our country wants to implement this policy, it will not be able to stand side by side with the League of Nations. Secondly, even if Manchuria becomes our country's protectorate in law or in fact, it is contrary to the principles of the League of Nations. Therefore, our country can only maintain order and tranquility in the insecure region of Manchuria, station heavy troops in Manchuria, and seek the peaceful and prosperous life of the 34 million people of Manchuria, so that it will belong to our protection in an intangible way. This policy should be recognized by the League of Nations. Although the League of Nations recognizes our country and does not interfere, the United States and Russia may rise up to oppose it. However, this matter is only a policy limited to Manchuria, and in order to ensure the permanent peace of the Far East, the understanding of the United States and Russia must be sought. As for the policy of making Manchuria an independent country and a buffer zone between China, Russia, and Japan, it does not violate the spirit of the League of Nations covenant, and even the United States and Russia cannot deny it. In this way, other gradual methods of our policy towards Manchuria, except for non-annexation, will not have any conflict or contradiction with the League of Nations covenant. The League of Nations will also not theoretically or formally interfere with Japan's actions. Since our country is free from the interference of the League of Nations, there is no possibility of withdrawing. Moreover, even if our country publishes a declaration of withdrawal, it will not take effect until two years later. And because of withdrawing from the League of Nations, although our country does not send representatives to Geneva, it is still a member of the League of Nations. Therefore, our country abandons the rights of the League of Nations and bears the obligations alone. It is not easy to do so. Because our country does not send representatives to participate in the League of Nations Council and the League of Nations General Assembly, we will allow the Chinese side to argue in the Sino-Japanese case, and our country has no place to defend. At that time, our country will inevitably be judged in absentia by the League of Nations. This is because withdrawing from the League of Nations will put us in an irreparable situation. In addition, because our country withdraws from the League of Nations, it will completely deprive us of the mandate to govern the South Pacific islands, and our country will lose its important permanent member status in the League of Nations from now on. In the future, it may not be possible to join the League of Nations and restore its original status. In short, today, when our country is in the midst of the revival of the continental policy, it cannot stand side by side with the League of Nations. However, it is even more impossible to withdraw from the League of Nations in order to avoid being bound by the covenant. According to the organization of the League of Nations, even if we declare withdrawal, we still cannot avoid the interference of the League of Nations. However, what hinders the implementation of our country's policy towards Manchuria is not the League of Nations but the United States and Russia.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Wild Cries</p>
<p>I happened to walk outside the city on Sunday. The green fields stretch to the sky. The fragrant grass is unharmed. Suddenly, I heard the cries of women. The sound was mournful and heartbreaking. Alas, every year at the Cold Food Festival, we encounter this flourishing spring. The willows on the roadside are uniquely cut off from the empty boudoir. How sad it is! I felt it and created this:</p>
<p>Spring clouds cry, the wilderness gradually darkens,</p>
<p>White poplars rustle, separated by heavy fog.</p>
<p>From now on, never return from the ends of the earth,</p>
<p>Who can I tell my heartbreak to?</p>
<p>(Lin Zhipeng)</p>
<p>Glimpses of the Battlefield</p>
<p>Swallows</p>
<p>Since the violent sun invaded Zhabei, Wusong, and Jiangwan, all of our countrymen have been united in hatred. Yesterday, a friend escaped from the battlefield and described how the Japanese lured Chinese traitors and various illegal acts. It was heartbreaking to hear. I will jot it down in a haphazard way to show a glimpse.</p>
<p>Since the town of Huangdu was occupied by the Japanese army, the homes of gentry and wealthy families have been emptied. However, a group of riffraff colluded with Chinese traitors in Jiangbei, strutting around and acting as accomplices. They persuaded merchants to open their shops. The villagers were hesitant to move forward. Therefore, they recruited a troupe of flower drum operas from Shanghai, gathered famous male and female Shenqu opera singers, and performed various lewd dramas. As a result, the villagers flocked to them. One night, just as they were gleefully portraying wantonness, they were seen by Japanese soldiers, who insisted that the female opera singers take off their skirts and pants to amuse themselves. The crowd applauded incessantly. The clever female opera singers secretly escaped from backstage. When the news spread to Shanghai, everyone took it as a joke. This is indeed a person with a different kind of heart.</p>
<p>The Jiangwan Racecourse was the scene of the fiercest battles between the two armies. The ground was covered with shell casings. Villagers gathered to pick up the casings. The copper of the shell casings is all of the highest quality. Gathering them in Shanghai, one can get 18 cents per pound. Those who are agile can pick up 30 or 40 pounds, and the selling price is also considerable. The other day, three Indians came and picked up shells with the crowd. One Indian picked up a bomb and fiddled with it repeatedly. With a bang, it exploded. The Indian's abdomen was broken and his intestines flowed out. The scene was terrible. Later, the Indians who came with him carried him away. As a result, those who picked up shells became wary and were not as enthusiastic as they had been in the past.</p>
<p>Education for Refugees</p>
<p>Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>The discovery of Chinese traitors is mainly due to the difficulties of the people's livelihood and the narrowness of knowledge. If good education is given, it is not difficult to save them. People are not made of wood or stone. How can they understand the great road and willingly be slaves and trap their children and grandchildren in eternal damnation? Colleagues in the Shanghai education community have specially organized a Refugee Education Committee. The purpose is to remind the displaced compatriots of their patriotism so that they can recognize the nation as an eternally immortal group, give them spiritual training, and cultivate the hearts of the people. The committee has twelve members, all of whom are scholars. Every day, they go to seventy-five refugee shelters to patiently persuade more than 2,700 male and female disaster victims. Based on the environment, level, and psychology, they compile their own teaching materials. They also publish three-color picture books, explaining them in simple words, such as describing Shanghai's position, Shanghai's liveliness, the Japanese soldiers' siege, killing and arson, inhumanity, and the necessity of resistance by our countrymen. The second lesson of the third issue of the picture book is a picture of displaced people, with the words (People with homes become homeless. People with money become moneyless. Many people have lost their lives. Many people have no food to eat). These few words can deeply stimulate the disaster victims who have been displaced and have no home to return to. It is said that when a certain committee member lectured on this lesson, the disaster victims all sobbed. I think that today's middle and high school students can engage in this during their spare time. Please do not ignore it because the matter is small.</p>

<p>The Shanghai War and Military Weapons (9)</p>
<p>One Store</p>
<p>Poison Gas</p>
<p>Before the nineteenth century, evil-smelling drugs, stimulating drugs, incendiary drugs, and poison gas were invented. At that time, they were only used to kill humans and animals. Later, during wars, poisons, smoke-producing agents, and flame-throwing agents were also commonly used to kill people. Until the nineteenth century, Yipriite and Phosgene invented poison gas. As a result, cruel combat behavior became even more chilling. Because people who inhale poison gas immediately have their respiratory organs shut down, and their skin and internal organs rot and collapse. The nature of its severity is unmatched by any poison. It is found that the main components of this poison are a mixture of arsenic, cyanide, and other substances. Therefore, the Hague Peace Treaty of 1899 prohibited its use. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army used stinky gas because it could not capture Lushun. The Russian army smelled the stench and fell to the ground one after another. In the early days of the European War of 1914, the British and French Allied forces also secretly filled it in shells and fired them. In April 1915, when the Allied forces attacked the Ypres fortress, yellow-green gas clouds suddenly emitted from the German front line and drifted to the British and French front lines. 10,000 people were poisoned and 5,000 died. And 5,000 prisoners also died. This was the most severe battle using poison gas. At the Washington Conference, everyone saw such cruel killing and proposed a strict ban. However, although it is prohibited in form, all countries are still secretly manufacturing it. Because modern warfare has sophisticated trenches, solid fortresses, and ineffective aircraft and cannons, only poison gas can destroy the enemy's position. As for the method of making poison gas, there is temporary, semi-permanent, and permanent. Generally, it is installed in cannons or mortars to launch, or installed in hand grenades to throw, or loaded in airplanes to drop. If six tons of poison gas is used, then the people of a vast metropolis can be completely wiped out in 30 minutes. When the Jiangwan battle was raging, it was rumored that the enemy, because</p>

<p>(Qiaerbin) It has been previously reported that a Japanese military train overturned at a location 15 kilometers from Harbin. According to the Russian train driver, the train derailed when it reached a location 15 kilometers east of Harbin because the spikes on the rails had been removed. The gasoline being transported immediately exploded, and the ammunition also exploded immediately. Five train cars were immediately engulfed in flames, resulting in the death of fourteen people. Fifteen other freight cars were also burned, causing numerous casualties. The China Eastern Railway immediately set up a rescue train, and all cadres departed to handle the aftermath. Regiment Commander Hasebe rushed to the scene, and aircraft also departed for the area. (14th Electric Communication dispatch)</p>

<h3>Another Train Derails on the China Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Suspects Red Party Involvement</p>
<p>(Harbin) The China Eastern Railway is still not stable. Another train derailed near Harbin last night. Because it was a freight train, there were no casualties.

<h3>Declaration of the National Crisis Conference</h3>
<p>Concentrate the Nation's Talents and Resources</p>
<p>Engage in Long-Term Resistance Together</p>
<p>Externally, There Must Be Independent and Autonomous Diplomacy</p>
<p>Internally, There Must Be Well-Equipped National Defense</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The full text of the declaration of the National Crisis Conference is as follows: After the three northeastern provinces were forcibly occupied by the violent Japanese and the Shanghai war suffered setbacks, the National Crisis Conference was convened in the temporary capital of Luoyang. The attendees deeply understand that the creation of today's national crisis did not happen in a day. External aggression and internal problems have occurred together for decades. Only by mobilizing the strength of all four hundred million people and working together with nations in the world that treat us as equals and uphold justice can we achieve international freedom, equality, and domestic unity and peace. Since 1905, the peace of the Pacific and the independence of China have been constantly threatened. The so-called treaty of 1915 was signed under duress by Japan, taking advantage of the opportunity of the Great War. After the European War, the Washington Nine-Power Conference made the greatest effort to restore a peaceful situation in the Pacific. However, the constraints of the 1915 Sino-Japanese Treaty on the three eastern provinces had long been a latent seed of war in the Pacific. The Chinese people deeply understand that the war in the Pacific, or unfortunately, may expand into a Second World War. They have never recognized the coerced treaty of 1915, which endangered our territorial and administrative integrity. They believed that the outbreak of war in the Pacific and the world could be temporarily avoided due to the tolerance of the Chinese people, and they wanted to take this opportunity to devote themselves to political reform and social improvement so that China could gradually achieve international equality and freedom, and the peace of the Pacific and the world could be maintained for a long time. Unexpectedly, in the past two years, countries around the world have encountered an unprecedented economic panic. The Japanese government believed that European and American countries were unable to maintain the balance of power in the Pacific, so it disregarded the League of Nations Covenant and began military occupation of our three eastern provinces on September 18, 1931. During this period, our country suffered a major flood in the Yangtze River basin, agriculture went bankrupt, and people were displaced everywhere. Suddenly encountering this unprecedented violence, the people could not bear it and had to passively resist Japan to prompt it to reflect. The Japanese government used this as an excuse to repeatedly carry out planned large-scale riots in Tianjin, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Shantou, and other places. Finally, their navy and army invaded Songhu. The 19th Route Army stationed in Songhu fulfilled its responsibility to defend the territory and had no choice but to make legitimate defense, resisting for a month. Three days before the League of Nations convened, it withdrew its entire army to Kunshan to wait for friendly countries around the world to make a fair decision based on the League of Nations Charter. However, the Japanese army continued to increase its numbers. Although the troop withdrawal conference was held, they made all kinds of sophistry and had no sincerity. Who would believe that they did not intend to disrupt world peace and undermine the League of Nations Covenant? This conference believes that China, in this serious situation, has no way to survive without concentrating the nation's talents and resources and engaging in long-term resistance together. And long-term resistance must be nationwide, with full preparations in military, political, economic, and financial aspects. We deeply hope that the people of the whole country, regardless of party or class, will unite sincerely, sacrifice all prejudices, and jointly plan strategies for resistance. This conference believes that the strategies for resistance must include independent and autonomous diplomacy externally and well-equipped national defense internally. In terms of independent and autonomous diplomacy, we should eliminate the past habits of following conventions and perfunctoriness in a negative way, and we should have a clear and consistent policy from beginning to end in a positive way. And it is especially urgent to unite with countries in the world that uphold justice and treat us as equals. In terms of well-equipped national defense, military system reform should be the key, and breaking the past pattern of cyclical internal wars based on the principle of popular armed forces is the only path for the people of the country to strive for in the future. Considering that in democratic countries, sovereignty resides in the people, unless the people of the whole country unite as one, the effect of saving the country and resisting foreign aggression will still not be seen. This conference believes that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to establish a civil administration system, determine the basis of civil rights, and the people have no opportunity to exercise political power, it is difficult to gain the training to exercise political power. Therefore, there should be an organ of public opinion in the central government, and the promotion of autonomy should be sought at the local level. In order to seek the development of civil rights and the growth of constitutionalism, the people must have freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association. This conference believes that the organization of public opinion organs must come together with the acquisition of freedom. Before the completion of constitutionalism, ensuring freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association is an urgent need for the people of the whole country. Furthermore, the decline of China's social economy is the source of all chaos, and the signs of decline can be seen in agricultural bankruptcy and industrial depression. As a result, famines occur frequently, bandits run rampant, and the country's power declines. Foreign aggression is becoming increasingly urgent. This conference believes that developing production is essential, and during the period of developing production, repairing water conservancy and alleviating unemployment are especially important. This conference deeply understands that the future of China's social and political development must not be limited to this situation. The four hundred million people of China have their own far-reaching demands. Externally, they demand national independence, and internally, they demand the alleviation of suffering. They will never be satisfied with the above-mentioned points. However, after the three northeastern provinces and Songhu were devastated, resisting foreign aggression is especially urgent. This conference deeply hopes that the government will accept these minimum demands, adopt these most practical views, and unite with friendly countries around the world that treat us as equals and uphold justice to jointly eliminate the Japanese violence that is undermining the Pacific and international peace. This conference further hopes to follow the people of the whole country to promote democracy, enjoy freedom, cultivate a glimmer of hope, so that society and politics can embark on a bright future, then the efforts of this conference in this extremely short period of time will not be in vain. We hereby declare this. (13th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Will Discuss Financial Matters</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhaoming arrived in Nanjing at 6:00 PM. (14th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen is scheduled to return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 15th to discuss financial reorganization methods with Wang.

<p>(Xuzhou) Wang Jingwei's special train left Luoyang and headed east on the morning of the 13th. When passing through Zhengzhou in the afternoon, he turned north to inspect the Yellow River Bridge. He finally arrived in Xuzhou at 7:50 AM on the 14th, stopped for 20 minutes, and then headed south to Nanjing. When reporters interviewed Wang on the train, they inquired about the National Crisis Conference. Wang said that the National Crisis Conference was decided to be convened by the Fourth National Congress and stipulated by the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee to discuss the three matters of resisting foreign aggression, disaster relief, and pacification. In January, the government issued an order to convene the conference. The Executive Yuan was handling matters based on the resolutions. When members Xiong Xiling and others met with him in Beijing, they were informed that matters related to the above three within the authority of the Executive Yuan could be answered responsibly, and matters beyond the authority of the Executive Yuan could not be answered responsibly, but could be discussed freely. Xiong and others failed to convey this clearly to some members. Now that the conference has been held, there have been two absolute proposals: 1. End tutelage immediately and implement constitutionalism, and reorganize the government immediately. 2. The issue of completing tutelage and promoting constitutionalism cannot be discussed and completed without the Fifth National Congress. The debate was fierce. Later, according to the proposal of member Yang Duanliu, 1. End tutelage as scheduled. 2. Establish the National Assembly in advance. Both were passed with great satisfaction. It can be seen that the discussions at the meeting were originally very free. Misunderstandings outside can be dispelled, he said. (14th special dispatch)</p>

<h3>Five Provinces' Bandit Suppression Will Establish General and Deputy Commanders</h3>
<p>He Yingqin and Chen Jitang Are Expected</p>

At the same time, he pointed out that appointing He Yingqin to this position would be most appropriate, because the troops in Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Jiangxi are mostly former subordinates of He, making it easy to direct and deploy them. After consideration, the central government seemed to agree. The title may be called General Commander of Bandit Suppression in the Five Provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, with Chen Jitang as his deputy. He is still in the process of declining the position. (14th special dispatch)</p>

<h3>Reactions to the Arrest of the Sh报 Reporter</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member talked about the arrest of the Sh报 reporter Zai Xiwu by Zhao Qijun, the secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee. Regardless of whether the resolution of the Citizens' Assembly is valid, it is unfortunate that this happened at a time when the National Crisis Conference has just resolved on freedom of speech, making people feel the danger of military personnel handling political affairs. Because military personnel have stronger personalities, they often handle matters arbitrarily. The Central Committee hopes that Zai Jun will be restored to freedom soon. A certain jurist said that the provincial government is an institution, and even if there is a rumor of reorganization, it is not appropriate to make reckless attacks on individuals. At most, a serious correction is enough. If a person is arrested simply for saying that the provincial government will be reorganized, even warlords in the past did not commit such barbaric acts.
