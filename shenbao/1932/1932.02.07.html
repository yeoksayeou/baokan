<p>世界各國當戰爭之時第一關。鍵全視有無維持金融之能力。金融能維持得法。則難關自能平安渡過。不得其法。則全國騷然矣。歐洲大戰之時。英國善於維持。金融得免於紊亂德國維持不善。馬克遂一落千丈此其明證。夫金融所以能收維持之效。固賴政府當局之蓋籌碩畫。而尤賴民衆激發愛國之心。一致恊助。此次日軍犯滬。目的即在破壞上海之金融重心以實現其侵略政策。彼蓋深知我舊歷年關爲各業結束之期。無論勝負。一經擾亂。則人心必。慌慌則提存擠。現一齊擁起。金融即可破產。上海金融一倒。則沿滬杭京滬之金融。一齊牽動。其用意比侵佔東三省土地爲更陰險。爲禍亦更鉅大。我國民能明察其　結所在。善爲應付。則尚可圖存。蓋金融業之組織。無非吸收存欵。以爲放欵流通之用。斷無常集鉅數之金。封存在庫。此最爲淺顯而易知。者當此砲聲震天。各業逃生救死不暇。即在安全之地。風聲所播。亦感不安。欠欵者旣無力能還。而存欵者乃以惶恐之。故。急急提取存欵。以圖自保。如此則金融安得不相擠而倒。殊不知金融倒則彼圖自保者。亦安能獨保。此其見解。非特不知愛。國亦可謂不智之甚。况乎銀錢兩界。均有財產保管委員會之組織。則金融機關更可鞏固。如不自擾。自可高枕無憂。今聞上海商人。已相約於金融復業時不提存。欵蓋亦深知愛護金。融即所以愛護國家。愛護自身。倘各地商人。皆能如此。則此岌岌可危之國難。不難安然而渡。矣</p>

<p>火線内之慘狀</p>
<p>記者住居閘北寳山路華興里、適當火線之衝、二十八日夜開火後、翌晨即遵日飛機之轟炸、記者在砲火、中歷經十六小時、兩次冒越火線、方得將眷屬大小七口救出、暫在租界安頓、此事曾誌前報、記者家屬等、雖從虎口餘生、僅以身免、一切財物、完全未取、及到租界以後、身無餘貲、甚至身上需要衣服、亦無更換、驚魂方定、痛苦隨來、　無衣無錢、在逃難期内、更爲難受也、昨日上午、記者以衣物銀錢、兩皆斷缺、遂與同時逃出之鄰居友人及親戚等五人商議、乘此我軍勝利之際、决計冒險、遄返華興里火線、企圖往取衣服銀錢、我們五人中、四人爲男性、一人爲女性的丫頭、遂於昨晨四時半、於黑夜内出發、而第二次之冒險到戰線、眞令人驚悸欲死矣、結果、物件未取、歷盡千般苦嚇、於亂彈中、爬地扶牆逃出、而隨往之小大姐一名、且已驚怖成疾矣、記者亦覺有生以來、爲第一次大險、較上次十六小時、尤覺萬倍也、</p>
<p>清晨起程　我們五人、約定在上午四時半、到厦門路取齊、至五時一刻、天尚未明、便各出發、各人僅帶現洋三四元、及房屋上鎖匙數個、出發之時、係向新閘橋以西、沿蘇州河、上河内停泊小民船、與渡載難民之船上、擬擺至河北、以入閘北華界、無如爬登民船後、河内已經小船梗塞、不能北搖、而渡船且有一艘、爲難民過多翻沉、溺死多人、故咸不肯再行載人、余等上船後、咸抱奮進之心、不顧船與船之距離、而爭相跳躍過渡、南岸有外兵警備、北岸又慮遇見日兵、則生命全無、歷盡艱苦、始逹彼岸、由污泥中爬上北岸、逹到滬北、天色方作魚肚白、我等從荒野間兜抄向東、幸同行之成衣司一人、地理熟悉、得以潛伏而行、歷過不少路途、始逹共和新路之西段、時天亦漸明、而槍砲聲亦漸近、途中行人、異常稀少、再向東走便是火線、</p>
<p>冒險到家　我等五人、行過鐵路以、北望東漸、進將到永興路、見我忠勇衛國之十九路軍士、散在四處、房屋之被敵機炸毁而火烟不熄者、舉目東望、無處無火焰上冲、我方之高射砲、已架在地上、槍彈一路不絶、我等先由十九路軍問明原因、便阻止我們前進、謂華興里鴻興路一帶爲警戒區、已禁阻行人、余等告以逃難倉卒、衣物銀錢、全在家中、乞求准予通行、寧願冒險、務必歸家取物、兵士鑒我等情切、遂切囑須沿邊倚屋而行、我等始冒險前進、竊幸其時砲聲漸止、然槍聲仍斷續不絶、最險者爲穿過馬路、余等將到光裕里前、目見鱗次櫛比民房、大半爲炸彈大砲所轟到、破垣斷壁、觸目皆是、而火光熊熊、我等方喜將近家門、突來槍彈一排、打入我等行近之房屋上、彈落地時、灰塵激起、距記者不過一二尺我等恐嚇過甚、疾馳而逃、而隨去之一小大姐、已驚跌在地、號泣不能行走、約七時四十分、方到華興里、</p>
<p>軍警告示　自戰事發生後、不肖匪徒、竟有乘機刦取財物、我等到永興路、即見軍警告示、已槍决乘亂搶物之匪徒八名、並處决放火擾亂之奸細六人、永興路前後左右之鴻興坊·鴻吉坊·香山路光裕里·等處房屋、非炸燬即燒去、獨華興里仍巍然獨存、時總弄鐵門已銷、我等到時、即有十九路軍盤查、須出示鑰匙、説明住宅號數、經看弄者證實、方許入</p>
<p>内取物、蓋恐匪徒之冒取也、余等入華興里、見水深没踝、蓋自來水已經炸壞、而房屋盡浸水中矣、電燈火已熄、弄内一百九十幢房屋、祇留兩個老嫗·一個老年之看弄、人餘均逃走矣、</p>
<p>槍砲齊來　我等方入家内、欲思取物、詎料天空中大隊日飛機又來、軋軋之聲、充滿天空、共有十餘架、飛行至低、意在炸我們住屋、機到我軍即開槍砲射擊、同時日兵之大砲機槍頻作、蓋乘飛機掩護而來進攻也、我等在家内聽得機聲、即已大驚、欲逃出房屋、不料轟轟砲聲、將房屋震得格格作嚮、而槍聲如連珠、在砲聲中、又聞得許里里之聲（大約砲彈飛過）我等之膽幾爲嚇破、蓋從未聞得如此近而且多之飛機大砲機槍等同時並作的大聲也、我等以爲必遭擊死無疑矣、五人於此聲裏逃伏一處、聽天由命而已、</p>
<p>逃歸租界　在此大戰之際、除各種槍砲聲外、我們又聞得弄外之喊聲、心膽爲之摧裂、天幸華興里祇有槍彈流到樓上與屋面上、並無砲彈打着、我們伏在樓下水中、約一時左右、漸聞飛機已逃、砲聲亦稀、五人至此、乃决計不再上樓取物趕快逃走其時已在上午十一時矣五人仍空身蹈水而、出祇一隣居帶一被頭、抵弄堂口、欲出弄西、見守兵又換、多着黄呢軍衣、我等向之説明欲逃走、詎該兵乃廣西、人不　滬話、後用鉛筆書示、該兵謂、此地乃戰線之警戒區、非兵士得通行、我等聞此乃大駭、百般與商、終不允許、各人面面相覷、唯有坐而待斃、同時爭相恕悔、直至下午一時許、始經十九軍某排長經過、方許我等隨伊保護之下、送到共和新路、而行走時之困難、非筆墨所可形述、設非其引導、我等已死矣我等脱離火線後、仍走向未行過之四鄕、而抄在途中、有兩次聴到、砲彈又由頭上飛過、我們伏地而避、後在距離較遠之處、僱到人力車兩輛、五人同乘、費洋四元、直至潭子里時、已下午四時半矣、好容易僱到一江北船、（該地盡是江北草屋）以三元代價、渡至對岸、於泥污中上陸、逹至東京路之盡頭、始克狼狽歸來、一物未取、幾送五命、事後迴想、猶爲恐悸也、</p>

<p>大批陸軍增調來滬</p>
<p>聲明不侵英國利益</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　駐美日大使出淵今日通知國務院、日本陸軍一師計九千人、現由日本遣往上海、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　關於派兵赴滬之重要説、明原定今日公佈、但因内閣欲重行考慮所需兵額、並减低原有預算、故展緩發表、當道現雖仍不許披露出兵詳情、但報告出兵之簡略新聞、則已可爲檢查員所通過、据官塲消息、駐華使重光主張此事暫守嚴格秘密、蓋恐華軍聞之、大舉進攻、以殲滅此死傷已逾什一之日本陸戰隊也、日政府雖對於駐外代表、亦未告以出兵事、是以駐美大使出淵近且向美國務卿聲明、日本不欲派兵赴滬、海相今日告路透訪員、上海陸戰隊無多、與十倍之敵衆繼續接戰、疲勞已極、日政府今决議派兵赴滬、無非欲策應陸戰隊、而逐退上海附近之華軍耳、日本絶對無佔据土地、或傷害英國在長江利益之意、一俟目前之工作完成後、即可撤兵、日本派兵赴滬、誠可爲人誤會、但希望日軍到滬後、華軍不戰而退、即使戰爭爲不可免、英國亦儘可放心、日軍作戰區域、當有嚴格限制也云、路透訪員詢以戰地範圍、海相答稱、約延長二三十里、但决不擴、大日本之視上海事件與視滿洲事件、眼光完全不同、英國若能知此、則可了然於未有疑問日本意思之必要矣、滿洲爲日本生死事件、而上海則不過偶有事件、日本對於滬事、亟願及早結朿之、俾可撤兵、希望上海仿天津辦法、由國際恊定、在指定區域内不許華兵駐紮、如是則上海將來可永無續起衝突之可能矣、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　据某要津聲稱、日政府將在倫敦巴黎日内瓦上海發表聲明書、其中含有派往上海之援軍、一俟目的旣達、即擬撤回等語、聞該聲明書志在解釋日本不得不派援兵至上海之理由、並消除各國政府之誤會、因各國政府聞日政府派軍消息、皆向日本表示失望也、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c46">倫敦 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>各界聞日政府决議派陸軍一師至滬之消息、皆呈不安之象、外交部對於該問題、縅默不發一言、列强總揆現正交換關於提交日本下一照會應具何性質之意見、並殷切辯論繼續提出情禮的抗議、是否有用、孟却斯德指導報曰、日本之侵略、僅能由國聯會員之列强决心實施國聯會章各條欵、始足遏止之、又曰、全世界之輿論、幾已一致抗日矣、至少讓國聯一試之、泰晤士報現信日當局已與中國官僚一團接近、其結果或將組成利於日本之地方政府、該報又以冷酷之語調、謂日海軍大將之投身閘北、僅使中國平民慘遭殺戮、使日本軍隊大受損失、使國際形勢大爲錯綜、使日軍原來享有世界之同情、失其大半云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　聞日本聲明書中解釋其不得不派援軍之理由如下、㈠日水兵抵抗十倍之衆之華兵、力旣不足、且需休息、㈡此舉之目的、正與列强增加駐滬軍隊相同、㈢此舉限於保護旅滬三萬日人之利益與安全、並實行租界防務日本之責任、㈣聲明書中謂華軍如不阻撓日軍盡其職責、則日軍不攻擊華軍、㈤聲明書主張滬案與滿案完全不同、日當局謂列强旣責日軍用公共租界爲攻擊之根据地、其唯一免此之法、即爲增厚日軍兵力、蓋現有之陸戰隊兵力太薄舍由租界攻擊、無他法也、日本顯望日援軍到滬後、華軍見機引退、但華軍如不自行退走、則日軍必將迫令退至平安距離也、（六日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Protecting Finance　Silent <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The primary key for all countries during wartime is their ability to maintain finance. If finance can be maintained effectively, difficulties can be overcome peacefully. If not, the whole country will be in turmoil. During the European war, Britain maintained finance well, avoiding chaos, while Germany failed, causing the Mark to plummet. This is clear evidence. The effectiveness of maintaining finance relies on the government's overall planning and, even more, on the public's patriotism and unified cooperation. The Japanese army's invasion of Shanghai aimed to destroy Shanghai's financial center to realize its aggressive policies. They deeply knew that our Lunar New Year is the time for all industries to settle accounts. Whether victorious or not, once disturbed, people will panic, causing a run on banks. If everyone rushes to withdraw their savings, finance will collapse. If Shanghai's finance collapses, the finance along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing lines will be affected. Their intention is more insidious and the harm is greater than occupying the three northeastern provinces. If our people can understand the crux of the matter and respond well, there is still hope for survival. The organization of the financial industry is merely to absorb deposits for lending and circulation. It certainly does not hoard large sums of money in vaults. This is very basic and easy to understand. When the sound of gunfire is deafening, industries are too busy trying to survive. Even in safe places, rumors spread, causing unease. Debtors cannot repay their debts, and depositors are terrified, rushing to withdraw their savings to protect themselves. In this case, how can finance avoid a run and collapse? They do not realize that if finance collapses, those who try to protect themselves cannot protect themselves alone. This view is not only unpatriotic but also unwise. Moreover, the silver and money industries have property protection committees, making financial institutions even more secure. If people do not disturb themselves, they can rest easy. It is heard that Shanghai merchants have agreed not to withdraw deposits when finance resumes, deeply knowing that protecting finance is protecting the country and themselves. If merchants everywhere can do the same, this precarious national crisis can be overcome peacefully.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3 id="e2">No Intense Fighting Between the Two Armies Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Our Air Force Achieved a Small Victory in Combat</p>
<p>One Enemy Plane Shot Down in Zhenru</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Repelled in Zhabei</p>
<p>Wusong Safe Except for a Major Fire</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese army attacked our positions with machine guns and rifles from their bases, occasionally with artillery. The attacks were more intense in the evening but were repelled by our army. Several Japanese planes dropped bombs on Zhabei and other places. Our air force dispatched six planes, chasing the enemy planes from Zhabei to Zhenru, finally shooting down one enemy plane. The rest fled in panic. Wusong was also attacked by enemy planes but was repelled by our army with anti-aircraft guns. The fort is safe. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e3">Battle Situation in Zhabei <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Our Air Force Pursued Enemy Planes</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Opened Fire, Our Troops Retaliated</p>
<p>Our Army's Frontline Slightly Advanced</p>
<p>Yesterday, both sides in Zhabei entered a state of ceasefire, with no major contact. There were occasional artillery sounds from the Japanese side, mainly to prevent our army from attacking, to demonstrate their strength, and to bomb civilian houses. Around 3:00 AM yesterday, there was a brief contact at Fuxing Road and Xinmin Road, which was repelled by our army with machine guns in about ten minutes. At 4:20 AM, machine gun fire started again, mainly around Qiujiang Road, interspersed with artillery and mortar fire, which gradually subsided around 5:00 AM. These were mainly contacts between frontline sentries. Afterwards, the firing was intermittent. Both sides retaliated within their defensive works, with no progress. At around 10:00 AM, a squadron of six of our planes took off, circling and scouting over Zhabei for about an hour before flying to Zhenru to pursue Japanese planes. At around 1:00 PM, Japanese soldiers gathered in large numbers at Laobazi Road and Fuxing Road. Our army had already learned of this and had stationed heavy troops there, so the Japanese soldiers never dared to attack. At around 3:30 PM, nine Japanese planes circled over Zhabei, attempting to drop bombs, but as they descended, our army bombarded them with mortars and anti-aircraft guns, preventing them from succeeding. They dropped over thirty bombs, none of which exploded. The Japanese soldiers then switched to long-range artillery fire, which our army retaliated against, causing the artillery fire to resume. Infantry on all defense lines also fired with machine guns and rifles, gradually ceasing after 6:00 PM. However, around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a unit of about three to four hundred Japanese soldiers sneaked into the Shanyin Road between Song Park Road and Qingyun Road, attacking our army. Our army at that location surrounded them from behind, almost completely encircling the Japanese soldiers, causing over two hundred casualties. Only a few managed to escape. Afterwards, there was no major contact. Both sides remained in their original defensive lines. It is learned that the Japanese soldiers seem to be waiting for reinforcements, as they have suffered over two thousand casualties in recent days and do not want to sacrifice excessively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, news came that the Japanese army suffered heavy losses and retreated after a combined sea, land, and air assault. Our army bravely advanced, and the frontline has advanced to Tiantong'an and Disiwei Road. In the Baoxing Road area, the Japanese army launched several assaults the day before yesterday, but were all repelled by our army with machine gun fire, resulting in a disorganized defeat. Our side has reinforced the defenses with fresh troops, making them even more solid. The defeated Japanese soldiers have mostly taken refuge in residential houses. When the Japanese army assaulted our side the day before yesterday, there were many casualties, reaching over a thousand.</p>
<p>At 11:15 PM last night, there was a major battle at Beisichuan Road and Disiwei Road, starting with rifles and then handguns, soon followed by mortars, artillery, and machine guns, becoming increasingly fierce. Both sides seemed to be charging. Gunfire was dense like a string of pearls, lasting about twenty minutes. Fire broke out, suggesting that houses in the area were burned again. At the same time, the Japanese side used field guns from Hongkou Park to bombard the battlefield, firing over fifty shells. Our side retaliated with heavy artillery, the sound shaking the entire city. Fire followed where the shells landed. By around 0:35 AM this morning, the gunfire had gradually subsided, and the field guns had stopped firing, but intermittent gunfire still occurred from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Fierce Air Battle in Zhenru <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>One Enemy Plane Shot Down</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Dropped Bombs Everywhere</p>
<p>Injuring People in Various Places</p>
<p>The Japanese invaders used planes to drop bombs, harming our people and endangering Chinese and foreign men and women engaged in rescue work. Their actions are treacherous and unprecedented. Our air force responded, and yesterday shot down another plane. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Another Enemy Plane Shot Down Yesterday　Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, over ten enemy planes flew to Wusong, Zhabei, and Zhenru, dropping bombs. Our air force immediately dispatched six planes to respond. About an hour and a half later, one enemy plane was shot down by our army at an open space south of Zhenru Railway Station. Two Japanese pilots and one White Russian pilot died on the spot, and the plane was shattered. The remaining enemy planes, seeing the situation was bad, fled eastward. Our air force pursued them to the Wusong area before returning.</p>
<p>Injured Residents with No Resistance　Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, over ten Japanese planes dropped a bomb at the Gongxing Road small vegetable market, destroying a house. Because residents had already moved out, no one was injured. Our army's planes chased each other in the air, firing machine guns, but no one was injured. The Japanese planes later flew to Dachang and dropped a bomb, but fortunately, no one was injured. Later, at Wangjiajiao, over ten residents were injured. The Japanese army has retreated to the east of the railway and was still fighting in the Jiangwan Road and Tiantong'an area yesterday. Japanese soldiers were scarce on Beisichuan Road. Chinese police officers dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession were stationed at Kemin Road, Yingui Road, and to Binle'an Road. Houses were not burned. The Odeon Theatre was destroyed by bombing. The glass windows and medicine cabinets of the Wuzhou Pharmacy branch at the Laobazi Road intersection were also damaged. Over two hundred refugees at Shigaota Road have been rescued by the Red Cross. In the afternoon, there was fierce fighting in the Song Park Road area. It was heard that when Red Cross members went to rescue them, the refugees kept their doors closed, suspecting that Japanese plainclothes soldiers were attacking, and did not dare to open the doors. After the rescuers reassured them, the refugees followed the rescuers back.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Men and Women Died and Injured in Zhenru　An American female doctor (Dr. Love Sankin) from the Red Cross on Haige Road led the Central University Medical College rescue team to Zhenru yesterday morning around 9:00 AM to work. At 10:30 AM, while directing rescue efforts in front of Jinan University in Zhenru, preparing to go to the front line, an enemy plane soared in the sky and dropped a bomb, landing next to a large tree, about six feet away from the American doctor, destroying a transport vehicle. The doctor was knocked to the ground, covered in mud. She was rescued by her colleagues and found to have an arm injury, fortunately not serious, and was immediately taken to the main hospital for treatment. According to international law, when two countries are at war, Red Cross rescue teams are allowed to work, and no country may harm them. This time, the Japanese army disregarded everything, deliberately violating international law, demonstrating their cruelty. According to Huadong News Agency, yesterday morning around 11:00 AM, ten Japanese planes soared over the Zhenru area, dropping bombs everywhere. A bomb landed in Xiaochenjiazhai in the Zhenru district, destroying four houses and damaging the eaves of the back rows, killing over ten men and women. Four men and two women were seriously injured, and two children were crushed. Several other bombs landed in open spaces and did not explode. One bomb landed at the entrance of Jinan University, destroying a military vehicle. Residents in the area were extremely panicked.</p>
<p>Civilian Houses Destroyed in Caojiadu　Yesterday (the morning of the 6th around 10:15 AM, two Japanese planes circled in the sky over Caojiadu and Fanhuangdu in western Shanghai. Immediately, three of our planes pursued the Japanese planes, frequently firing machine guns, resulting in a major battle in the sky. Before long, the Japanese planes fled east. No. 26 Zhiging Lane, opposite the Caojiadu Jisi Fei'er Road fire brigade, was hit by a bomb that penetrated the roof and the upper floor, slightly damaging a table and a chair. Fortunately, no one was injured. The bomb was about two inches long and half an inch in diameter, cylindrical.</p>
<h3 id="e5">No Battles in Wusong Yesterday <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Only Enemy Planes Dropped Bombs</p>
<p>Forts Were Not Damaged</p>
<p>Major Fire in the Entire Town the Night Before</p>
<p>There were still no battles in Wusong yesterday. At around 11:30 AM, three enemy planes flew from Shanghai to Wusong, scouting over the northern and southern forts, and dropped eight bombs. Three bombs landed in the sea in front of the forts, and the rest landed in the fields near the land side of the forts, all exploding, but the forts were not damaged in the slightest. There were also no losses in the surrounding area. The forts then opened anti-aircraft fire, and the enemy planes fled. At around 2:00 PM, three more enemy planes flew to the forts but left without dropping bombs. Currently, one British and one American warship are anchored in the sea in front of the forts. Although traces of enemy warships remain outside the Wusong mouth, they are blocked by British and American warships, so they did not attack the forts. Observing the situation at the Wusong mouth yesterday, the war seems to be gradually easing.</p>
<p>At around 8:15 PM the night before last, three enemy plainclothes soldiers suddenly appeared in the town, dressed in Chinese clothes and looking like workers. They went to Zhongxin Road, pried open the door of the Renchang Rice Shop, and set fire to the house with kerosene oil. In an instant, the flames soared into the sky, making it impossible to approach. After succeeding, the enemy plainclothes soldiers immediately escaped. The fire quickly spread to neighboring houses. The town's fire brigades responded to the alarm and immediately drove to the scene to extinguish the fire. However, the fire was too fierce, and there were too few firefighters, making it impossible to put it out. The fire gradually extinguished until about 6:00 AM yesterday. Yesterday, reporters went to investigate the scene and found that over three hundred city houses on Zhongxin Road, south to Wanshun Sauce Garden and north to Dehe Pawnshop Majia Lane, Songxing Road, east to Jinjia Alley and west to Cuihualou Restaurant, Guizhu Road, east to Zhongxin Road intersection and west to Nantianmen Dim Sum Shop, and Hongyuan Road, east to Jinjia Alley and west to Zhongxin Road intersection, were completely burned down. The burned area was extremely large, accounting for about one-fifth of the entire town of Wusong. The commercial center of the town, concentrated in that area, was completely destroyed, resulting in huge losses that are impossible to calculate for the time being. After the fire broke out, the garrison immediately sent teams to capture the plainclothes enemy who set the fire, but they were long gone.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The City Government Repeated its Protest <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Landed in the Concession</p>
<p>Hoping the Municipal Council Will Pay Attention</p>
<p>The city government, because Japanese troops have repeatedly landed in the concession in recent days and are still using the concession as a base to attack our army, re-lodged a protest with the Municipal Council last night, saying: "Regarding the Japanese navy using the concession area as a base for attacking the Chinese army, I, the mayor, have repeatedly lodged serious protests with your council and urged you to stop it. Now, according to confirmed reports, a large contingent of Japanese troops arrived in the city yesterday, landing in the concession. After landing, they dispersed throughout the concession, preparing to attack the Chinese army and endangering the security of our city. Yet your council continues to tolerate them, which is difficult to understand. Therefore, I reiterate my protest and request that you seriously consider taking effective measures to strictly stop them, in the spirit of public friendship. Furthermore, according to reports, a large number of Japanese troops will arrive in Shanghai again in the next day or two, and I hope you will pay attention and not allow them to land in the concession to maintain your council's declaration of strict neutrality and avoid causing further misunderstandings among our people." This is addressed to Mackintosh, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession.</p>

<p>The American Military Commander Sent a Letter to Mayor Wu</p>
<p>Mayor Wu received a letter yesterday from Hawke, the commander of the American troops in this city, stating that the Japanese troops had left the American zone on the 4th. The translated text of the original letter is as follows: "Regarding our meeting at the British Consulate on Sunday afternoon about the Japanese troops being on the roads and in the factories within our zone, all the Japanese troops within our zone have left our zone as of yesterday, from north of the Racecourse to the Suzhou River and west of the boundary of the Public Concession. Please convey this to Division Commander Shounian and inform him that the American military zone can guarantee its neutrality." After receiving the letter, Mayor Wu has forwarded it to the division commander for verification.</p>

<p>Explaining the Actions of Japanese Troops in the Concession</p>
<p>The Municipal Council, due to repeated protests from Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, regarding Japanese troops using the concession as a base for combat, held a meeting on the evening of the 6th to consider the matter. It was unanimously decided to reply as follows: "We received your letters dated January 30 and February 3, 1932, stating that the Municipal Council is allowing Japanese troops to use the Public Concession area as a base for attacking your country's troops and has not taken effective measures to stop them. Therefore, the Municipal Council should bear all responsibility for the damage to the concession's neutrality. The neutrality of the Public Concession, or any similar clauses, may exist only because countries enjoying political or other benefits in the concession have concluded treaties or agreements to create them. Therefore, such conditions of concession neutrality can only be maintained and guaranteed by the signatory countries. As Japan is one of the signatory countries, the Japanese government alone is responsible for all actions of Japanese troops in the concession, and the Municipal Council has nothing to do with it. We are responding accordingly. We hope you will verify this. Furthermore, due to the large number of affairs in recent days, the reply was delayed. We apologize for any inconvenience. Mackintosh, Chairman of the Municipal Council, February 6."</p>
<h3 id="e9">Japanese Troops Landed at the Huishan Wharf <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Citizens on North Sichuan Road Advocated Not Allowing It</p>
<p>Sent a Letter to the Ratepayers' Association to Negotiate with the Municipal Council</p>
<p>The North Sichuan Road 17th District Citizens' Association sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday, stating: "Japan is relying on the Public Concession as a military base, designating the area north of the Suzhou River as a Japanese military zone, acting freely, trampling on businesses, burning civilian houses, and brutally killing Chinese people. Their evil deeds are unprecedented. Our association is located on North Sichuan Road, bearing the brunt of the attack, resulting in great losses, which need not be described. The Municipal Council is responsible for local security, and its failure to prevent this in advance is, in fact, its fault. It could be argued that it is weak and helpless, forced to endure and await assistance, which is understandable. Recently, the United Kingdom and the United States have sent considerable troops to Shanghai. Now that the concession has considerable preparations, it should strive to find solutions to maintain the East Asia's leading commercial center. If this continues, Chinese merchants will suffer significant losses, and all countries will experience economic panic, which is undesirable for all countries. However, to treat the symptoms, one must first treat the root cause. The reason why the Japanese can be so rampant is that their warships can come to port at will and their troops can land at will. Recently, Japanese troops have landed freely at the Huishan Wharf without any restraint. The Municipal Council should find ways to stop this, so that the military operations do not expand and the concession can maintain its original status. Otherwise, if Japanese troops continue to arrive, the war will inevitably prolong. If a dangerous situation occurs in the concession, will the Municipal Council bear full responsibility? Therefore, we request your association to urgently send a letter to the Municipal Council to take strict precautions and restore commerce in our area in the shortest possible time, in the spirit of public friendship." This is addressed to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association.</p>

<p>Explained in a Letter to the Ratepayers' Association Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association received a reply from the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "In reply to your letter of February 2, we have received and understood it. Regarding the fact that Japanese naval marines and plainclothes soldiers have usurped municipal powers, causing extreme panic in the northeastern districts of the concession, the Bureau has lodged the most serious protests with the consular leaders. We are currently using various pressures to force the Japanese side to stop its current actions. The Bureau has resumed important duties in all affected areas. The Bureau is particularly concerned about the safety of all residents in the area and is currently taking various measures to alleviate their difficulties. We hope you will be relieved."</p>
<h3 id="e11">Various Reports on Japanese Troops Being Defeated <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Admit They Cannot Attack　The Da Mei Evening News reported that the northwestern front in Zhabei has been quiet this morning (the 6th) after three days of fierce fighting, with only occasional rifle fire, machine gun fire, and artillery and bomb sounds. A representative of the Da Mei Evening News went to the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters at 207 North Sichuan Road this morning. A Japanese officer smiled and told the representative, "Today, the Chinese soldiers seem to be celebrating the New Year." He also said that Japanese troops could not attack Chinese soldiers' positions again without sacrificing many lives, so they are now waiting for reinforcements to continue their advance.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Admit Two Units Were Wiped Out　According to the Japanese-language newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, "Since our army (referring to the Japanese army below) launched a general attack on the morning of the 5th, there has been an unprecedentedly fierce battle. The enemy army resisted with all its might. Although our army fired fiercely, they charged from east and west, making it difficult for our army to advance. Before long, the enemy army (Chinese army) attacked the Japanese army with mortars, causing our army to suffer an unprecedentedly tragic defeat (direct translation from Japanese). The Ichikawa Company of the 0th Unit and the Ikeda Platoon suffered heavy losses because they were on the front line. Platoon leader Ikeda was also seriously injured, and two-thirds of all soldiers were killed or wounded, close to being wiped out (direct translation from Japanese). As for the 0th Unit, from 6:00 AM to 7:23 AM, the enemy army (Chinese army) continued to resist stubbornly. The enemy troops at Liuying Road harassed our army (Japanese army) from time to time, preventing our army from having time to eat. Near Binle'an Road, Second Sergeant Oyazono Eizo of the Yokosuka convoy was injured by a hand grenade. Company Commander Kaneda Keisuke was shot through the chest and abdomen, and their lives are in danger."</p>
<p>One Japanese Plane Sank into the Sea　The Da Mei Evening News reported that one more plane from the Japanese naval aviation unit fighting in Shanghai was lost in the sea yesterday (the 5th). According to a telegram from the owner of the American cargo ship Hanover at 3:00 PM yesterday, the ship rescued a Japanese army pilot at 31 degrees 21 minutes north latitude and 124 degrees 21 minutes east longitude. The land plane D-260 he was flying in ran out of fuel and landed on the sea surface and has already sunk. The Japanese pilot does not speak English. The ship is heading to Manila, etc. According to the location mentioned in the telegram, it is 200 miles east of the Jiangsu coast, almost directly in line with Wusong. It is believed that the Japanese plane must have been circling over Wusong in the early morning and lost its way, flying into the sea until its fuel ran out and it landed on the sea. The telegram said that the pilot was an army pilot and was flying a land plane, which may have been a misunderstanding due to the Japanese pilot not speaking English. It is likely that the plane was a small plane carried by a Japanese aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Nagasaki Ship Carried Japanese Refugees　Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, the Nagasaki Maru ship of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, fully loaded with Japanese merchants and residents seeking refuge to return to their country, left Shanghai and sailed out of the Wusong mouth. This was witnessed by an employee of the Xiangtai Lumber Company.</p>

<p>The Tragic State of the Front Lines</p>
<p>Your reporter resides in Huaxing Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, directly facing the front lines. After the start of firing on the 28th night, the next morning saw indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes. I, the reporter, spent 16 hours amidst the artillery fire, twice braving the front lines, before managing to rescue my family of seven, who are temporarily settled in the Concession. This matter was previously reported. Although my family and I escaped from the jaws of death, we only managed to save ourselves, losing all our belongings. After arriving in the Concession, we were left without any money or possessions, even lacking spare clothes. Once the initial shock subsided, the pain followed. Being without clothes or money during a period of fleeing from danger is even more difficult. Yesterday morning, realizing that we lacked both clothing and money, I discussed the matter with five people who had fled with me – neighbors, friends, and relatives. Taking advantage of our army's victory, we decided to venture back to the front lines in Huaxing Lane, hoping to retrieve some clothing and money. Among the five of us, four were men and one was a young female servant. Consequently, we set off at 4:30 yesterday morning, under cover of darkness. This second adventure into the battle zone was truly terrifying. In the end, we failed to retrieve our belongings and suffered immense fear, crawling on the ground and clinging to walls to escape the flying bullets. Moreover, the young servant girl who accompanied us has become ill from the fright. I, the reporter, feel that this was the greatest danger I have ever faced, surpassing the previous sixteen hours manifold.</p>
<p>Departure at Dawn  We five people agreed to gather at Xiamen Road at 4:30 AM. By 5:15 AM, the sky was still dark, and we each set off, carrying only three or four silver dollars and a few house keys. Upon departure, we headed west towards the New Zhabei Bridge, along the Suzhou River, boarding small civilian boats and boats carrying refugees, intending to cross to the north bank to enter the Chinese-controlled area of Zhabei. However, after boarding the civilian boats, the river was already clogged with small boats, preventing them from moving north. Moreover, one of the ferries had capsized due to overloading, resulting in numerous drownings, so no one was willing to carry more people. After boarding, we all embraced a spirit of determination, ignoring the distance between boats and vying to leap across. Foreign soldiers guarded the south bank, while on the north bank, we worried about encountering Japanese soldiers, which would mean certain death. After enduring great hardship, we finally reached the other shore, crawling out of the mud onto the north bank, reaching northern Shanghai. The sky was just beginning to show a hint of dawn. We detoured eastward through the wilderness. Fortunately, one of the traveling companions, a tailor, was familiar with the area, allowing us to proceed covertly. After covering a considerable distance, we reached the western section of the Republic New Road. By this time, the sky was gradually brightening, and the sound of gunfire was growing closer. There were very few pedestrians along the way. Continuing eastward meant entering the front lines.</p>
<p>Venturing Home  We five, having passed the railway, looked eastward and gradually approached Yongxing Road. We saw soldiers of our loyal and patriotic 19th Route Army scattered everywhere. Looking eastward, we saw houses destroyed by enemy aircraft bombings, with flames and smoke billowing upwards everywhere. Our anti-aircraft guns were already positioned on the ground, and bullets continued to fly incessantly. We first inquired with the 19th Route Army about the situation, and they stopped us from advancing, saying that the Huaxing Lane and Hongxing Road area was a restricted zone, and pedestrians were prohibited. We told them that we had fled in haste, leaving all our clothing and money at home, and pleaded to be allowed to pass, willing to risk danger to retrieve our belongings. The soldiers, seeing our earnestness, instructed us to stay close to the walls as we proceeded. We cautiously advanced, fortunate that the artillery fire had subsided somewhat, although gunfire continued intermittently. The most dangerous part was crossing the roads. As we approached Guangyu Lane, we saw that most of the closely packed houses had been hit by bombs and artillery shells, with shattered walls and broken tiles everywhere, and fires raging fiercely. Just as we were happy to be nearing home, a volley of gunfire struck the houses we were approaching. When the bullets landed, they stirred up dust, landing only a foot or two away from the reporter. We were terribly frightened and fled quickly. The young servant girl who came with us was so frightened that she fell to the ground, crying and unable to move. It was about 7:40 AM when we finally reached Huaxing Lane.</p>
<p>Military Warnings  Since the outbreak of hostilities, unscrupulous bandits have taken the opportunity to loot property. Upon reaching Yongxing Road, we saw military warnings that eight bandits who had taken advantage of the chaos to steal goods had been executed by firing squad, along with six spies who had started fires and caused disturbances. The houses in Hongxingfang, Hongjifang, Xiangshan Road, Guangyu Lane, and other places to the left and right of Yongxing Road were either destroyed by bombing or burned. Only Huaxing Lane remained standing relatively intact. The iron gates of the main alley were locked. When we arrived, soldiers of the 19th Route Army inspected us, requiring us to show our keys and explain the house number. After the guard confirmed our identity, we were allowed to enter and retrieve our belongings, to prevent bandits from pretending to be residents. Upon entering Huaxing Lane, we found the water ankle-deep, as the water supply had been damaged by bombing, and the houses were flooded. The electric lights were out. Of the 190 houses in the alley, only two old women and an elderly watchman remained; everyone else had fled.</p>
<p>A Barrage of Gunfire  As we entered our house, intending to retrieve our belongings, a large squadron of Japanese planes suddenly appeared in the sky, the rumbling sound filling the air. There were more than ten planes, flying low, intending to bomb our houses. As soon as the planes arrived, our troops opened fire with artillery and guns. At the same time, the Japanese soldiers' artillery and machine guns fired frequently, using the planes as cover to attack. Hearing the sound of the planes while inside the house, we were greatly alarmed. We wanted to escape the house, but the deafening artillery fire shook the houses violently. The gunfire sounded like a string of pearls, and amidst the artillery fire, we also heard the sound of 'whizzing' (presumably the sound of artillery shells flying overhead). We were terrified, as we had never heard such loud and numerous airplanes, artillery, and machine guns firing simultaneously. We thought we would surely be killed. The five of us huddled together in one place, resigning ourselves to fate.</p>
<p>Returning to the Concession  During this great battle, in addition to the sounds of various guns and artillery, we also heard shouting from outside the alley, which broke our hearts. Fortunately, only bullets struck the upper floors and roofs of the houses in Huaxing Lane; no artillery shells hit. We lay in the water on the ground floor for about an hour, gradually hearing the planes retreat and the artillery fire subside. At this point, the five of us decided not to go upstairs to retrieve our belongings and to escape as quickly as possible. It was already 11:00 AM. The five of us, still empty-handed, waded through the water and emerged. Only one neighbor took a quilt. Upon reaching the entrance of the alley, wanting to exit to the west, we saw that the guards had changed and were wearing yellow woolen uniforms. We explained to them that we wanted to escape, but the soldier was from Guangxi and did not understand Shanghai dialect. We then wrote our intentions in pencil, but the soldier said that this place was a restricted area of the battle zone, and only soldiers were allowed to pass. Hearing this, we were greatly dismayed. We pleaded and reasoned with him in every possible way, but he refused to allow us to pass. We all looked at each other, resigned to waiting for death. At the same time, we all expressed regret for our actions. It was not until about 1:00 PM that a platoon leader of the 19th Route Army passed by and allowed us to be escorted to Republic New Road. The difficulty of walking at that time cannot be described in words. If he had not guided us, we would have died. After escaping the front lines, we continued to walk through the countryside we had not traveled before. Twice on the way, we heard artillery shells flying over our heads, and we lay on the ground to avoid them. Later, at a greater distance, we hired two rickshaws, and the five of us rode together, paying four dollars. By the time we reached Tanzi, it was already 4:30 PM. We barely managed to hire a Jiangbei boat (the area was full of Jiangbei thatched cottages), and for a price of three dollars, it ferried us to the opposite bank. We landed in the mud and finally reached the end of Tokyo Road, managing to return in a disheveled state, without retrieving anything and almost losing five lives. Looking back on the event, we are still filled with terror.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial National Crisis Association declares to all fathers, elders, brothers, aunts, sisters, and compatriots:</p>
<p>The Japanese have seized our Three Eastern Provinces but are not yet satisfied. They rely on their aggressive spirit to oppress the Shanghai authorities, sparing no effort to demean our national dignity and suppress the will of the people, all to seek a fortunate escape. Yet, no sooner were the terms of surrender signed than the menacing cannon fire arrived. Our 19th Route Army, unable to bear it any longer, rose up in self-defense and dealt a major blow to the Japanese army. This shows that they are arrogant and therefore insecure, while we are thoughtful and able to survive. This is a natural principle, not mere luck. It is the law that a proud army is bound to be defeated, while a sorrowful army is bound to win. It is hoped that the authorities, who are timid about public war, will be awakened to this fact. Firstly. The crisis in the Eastern Provinces deepened as the military authorities retreated step by step, believing it better to lose territory than to lose strength. This was a clever calculation, but patriotic soldiers resolutely broke away, formed their own volunteer armies, and bravely resisted the enemy. General Ma Zhanshan has already made his name known throughout the world and will be remembered forever. Likewise, the JinxVolunteer Army and the Harbin Self-Defense Army are also accumulating strength, gathering streams to form seas, and building up power to become formidable forces. The 19th Route Army, originally burdened with anxieties, suddenly became a vital force in the heartland, guarding the capital. This demonstrates that preserving strength by abandoning territory is merely a means of eking out a living, while building up strength to defend territory is a truly powerful force united by the will of the people. This is the law that the righteous receive much help while the unrighteous receive little. It is hoped that the armies that are armed for self-defense will be awakened to this fact. Secondly. Liaoning and Jilin fell because of non-resistance, and Jinzhou was lost because of non-resistance. The League of Nations made a resolution, but the Japanese ignored it. The United States issued a warning, but the Japanese did not listen. Justice was not upheld, and reason was extinguished. The government authorities, timid and fearful, signed terms of surrender and leaned towards direct negotiations, causing patriotic people to hang their heads in despair, believing that the nation would soon be lost. However, the battle in Shanghai suddenly changed the situation. The government demonstrated its determination to resist by moving to Luoyang, and the international community showed a resolute inclination to intervene because of the Shanghai incident. The people of the whole country competed to offer assistance, turning sorrow into joy. Consuls stationed in Shanghai requested a ceasefire and worked hard to end the fighting. If we continue our efforts, the effect will be many times greater in a matter of months. This shows that justice must be upheld through confrontation, and reason must be established through a balance of power. This is the law that only those who help themselves can be helped by others, and that only with a price can success be achieved. It is hoped that those who trust in the League of Nations will be awakened to this fact. Thirdly. Since the Kuomintang came to power, five years have passed, but its measures have not satisfied the people. Internal disputes have arisen from time to time, and foreign aggression has followed, leading other parties in the country to express their dissatisfaction. Some have even attempted to sabotage the government. This is undeniable. However, with a strong enemy pressing on our borders and the country in a precarious state, if the country ceases to exist, what will the party have? Although the current government is composed of the Kuomintang, it should realize that the country does not belong solely to one party and that only by gathering the strength of the entire people and engaging in a long-term struggle can we save the country from danger. The government has already declared its position to our people. It should take a further step and declare the abolition of one-party rule, so as to gather national strength and no longer divide ourselves. All parties in the country that formerly opposed the Kuomintang should also prioritize national salvation, immediately declare the abandonment of old prejudices, eliminate past grievances, and cease all internal political struggles, so as to jointly address the national crisis. Once the enemy troops have left the country and the foundation of the nation is secure, we can all come together and calmly discuss national affairs, choosing the best course of action. This matter is of utmost importance. Korea perished because of party strife, a lesson that is not far removed and should give us pause. This is the law that unity makes strength, while division dissipates it. It is hoped that all parties in the country will be awakened to this fact. The government's declared goals are to maintain national integrity and respect international credibility. Its means are to encourage the military and police to engage in self-defense, vowing not to cede an inch of territory to the enemy, while also using diplomatic methods to demand that other countries fulfill their treaty obligations. The former is a determination to engage in legitimate defense, while the latter is to submit the matter to international arbitration. Therefore, the previous requests of the people for military strengthening and resistance to foreign aggression, the doubts about direct negotiations, and the opposition to diplomacy of surrender can all be dispelled. Now that the government has clearly stated its aims and moved its offices to Luoyang to seek freedom of action, standing on the same front as our people, our people should, from this day forward, change all previous attitudes of suspicion, resentment, and hatred towards the government, and instead unite against the foreign enemy. The members of this association, based on this understanding, have decided on the following measures to inform and urge the people of the country to implement them effectively:</p>
<p>(A) Armed Resistance: Our country has many coastal ports that the Japanese can use to load marines on warships and land them for harassment at any time and in any place. In addition to the government authorities having capable troops to defend the coastal ports, all people in our coastal provinces should, in accordance with the current Law on Defense Corps, train all able-bodied men between the ages of twenty and forty in firearms shooting and close combat techniques. In the event of an emergency, they should form volunteer armies to assist the local troops and fight to the death with the enemy. In the Eastern Provinces, the Japanese army advanced unimpeded as if entering an unpopulated land because the troops did not resist. Recently, people in various places have organized volunteer armies to fight the enemy and have won great victories, causing the Japanese army to dare not go deep and allowing the local areas to be peaceful. The Japanese army, transported from afar by warships, is ultimately small in number, while our people are ten or a hundred times more numerous than the Japanese army. Once trained to defend their local areas, every place will become a strong force capable of taking the lives of the Japanese.</p>
<p>(B) Economic Severance: The Japanese rely on industry to build their nation. All their products, such as yarn, cloth, seafood, and sugar, are sold in our country. In the past, a boycott of Japanese goods for less than three months was able to cause Japanese factories to close, ships to stop running, and banknotes to stop being exchanged. This time, the Japanese used troops to oppress the Shanghai authorities to abolish the anti-Japanese movement, which shows that a boycott of Japanese goods is what the Japanese fear most. This is also what enables our country to control the lifeblood of the Japanese. If we can continue the boycott for a year, the unemployed workers in their country will become impoverished and cause chaos, leaving them no strength to invade our country. It is regrettable that the authorities were weak and accepted their demand to abolish the work of anti-Japanese organizations. Fortunately, the Japanese have destroyed their own credibility by starting the war, so the previous signatures of surrender by the authorities are naturally invalid. Our people should urgently rouse their spirits, make efforts to boycott Japanese goods, and persevere to the end. Young intellectuals should expand their propaganda efforts to make it widespread and lasting.</p>
<p>(C) Save on Expenses and Contribute to the Military: This war against Japan is to maintain the survival of our nation and people. Whether our country survives or perishes, whether our people are masters or slaves, all depends on this one action. It is completely different from previous internal wars. Once the war starts, it is impossible to know when it will end, so the expenses will be enormous. Relying solely on customs duties and land taxes will certainly not be enough. Since the soldiers are sacrificing for our country and our people, we should not begrudge this small amount of money and refuse to donate as much as possible. Moreover, during the boycott of Japanese goods, we must use domestic goods exclusively, not minding if they are crude. We must strive to save money by being frugal, donating it to the military. Not only should we not waste money, but we should also save on the necessary expenses for clothing, food, and shelter as much as possible, which will benefit both supporting the military and boycotting Japanese goods.</p>
<p>(D) Recognize the Enemy: Our Chinese nation is a lover of peace, as is well known to the friendly countries of Europe and America. This time, the Japanese have repeatedly used means of destroying reason and being inhumane against us. Our people must rise up in resistance for self-preservation. Friendly countries should understand this difficult situation. We must recognize that our only enemy is Japan, only the Japanese militarists. Other European and American people in China are our friends. Even during intense fighting, we should still protect them properly. Since our people recognize that there is only one enemy, we should always use clear reason to control our fervent emotions. All intellectuals should also unite to conduct practical propaganda to make the people understand the true situation.</p>
<p>We respectfully hope that all the fathers, elders, brothers, aunts, sisters, and compatriots in the country will encourage each other and unite to carry out the above measures to save the country from crisis. The country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Japanese Media Reports on American Attitude <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Claiming Sympathy Towards China</p>
<p>The various Japanese newspapers in this port are widely reporting on America's attitude, expressing considerable sympathy towards China. The Mainichi Shimbun even recognizes America's "lack of thoroughness" and that "its tactics are quite inappropriate." The newspaper also claims that "America is quite sympathetic to the brave military actions of the Chinese army and its ability to use full and legitimate self-defense to sanction the brutality of the Japanese army. If China applies to various countries for the following three requests: (1) that various countries are willing to lend large sums of money to China on generous terms; (2) that the supply of foodstuffs is given full convenience; and (3) that the adjustment of military supplies can also be sincerely accepted. It is also said that although the United States is extremely calm on the surface, avoiding the deterioration of relations with Japan, it is secretly using various means to hinder Japan."</p>
<h3 id="e18">More British and American Troops Arrive Yesterday <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>British Troops Remain on Ships, American Troops Land</p>
<p>British Troops: The British have dispatched a large number of army artillery units from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Their commander-in-chief, Keren, also arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 5th aboard the flagship Kent. The artillery ship Belgals, Belgal, and the destroyer Sandwick, Sandwick, fully loaded with soldiers, also entered the port at 1:50 pm yesterday. They are currently anchored at berths 19 and 20 of the river terminal. The soldiers have not yet landed and remain on board.</p>
<p>American Troops: The Greater American Evening News reports that the 31st Regiment of the US Infantry landed this morning (the 6th) after arriving in Shanghai yesterday (the 5th) aboard the transport ship Gamond. At around 8 am, they passed through Nanjing Road and headed to the New World and the Racecourse for stationing. The commanding officer is Colonel Gasser.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Silver and Banking Industries Form a Property Protection Committee <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Greater Financial Stability</p>
<p>In order to maintain market stability and finance, the silver industry and Chinese banks, based on the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual protection, have specially organized a property custody committee by the Banking Association. The committee will take custody of the three types of assets of various banks: goods, properties in the central area of the concession, and securities in the London market, valued at approximately 50 million in cash. Foreign banks, realizing that their interests are closely intertwined, have also joined the association to take concerted action. Since the establishment of this committee, if any bank has a problem with cash flow, the committee can provide assistance. From now on, the market will be stable, and people's hearts will be more at ease.</p>
<p>Money Industry: Since the outbreak of the war in Zhabei, the money industry has been aware of the risk of financial collapse. To prevent this from happening, it decided to organize a special property custody committee in advance to have the guild protect the assets of the various firms. Based on the capacity of each firm, each firm contributed at least 200,000, the more the better. The results were excellent. As of the day before yesterday (the 5th), seventy firms had remitted a total of 15,583,000 taels of silver. It was decided to concentrate the cash to maintain the finance of the whole of Shanghai. Therefore, although there is a major danger this time, the financial industry (referring to money shops) can maintain the situation by concentrating a large amount of cash, so there is no need to worry about suffering losses. Therefore, the financial situation in recent days has been able to overcome the danger.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Red Cross Member Tan Reports Vigorous Morale of Our Troops <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Troops are Very Poor at Fighting</p>
<p>Iron Troops Vie to be First in Killing the Enemy</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter met with Red Cross member Mr. Qiao at his residence the night before last. They discussed the real situation on the front lines, which was quite exhilarating. Mr. Qiao recounted the vigorous morale of our troops, which made the listeners' blood boil. They wished they could go to the front lines immediately and fight to the death with the Japanese. The following is an excerpt from Mr. Qiao's account (the following is all from Mr. Qiao):</p>
<p>I have been rushing to the front lines for several days, solely responsible for the work of rescuing wounded soldiers. According to the wounded lower-ranking officers of our army, this is a rare opportunity for the 19th Route Army to resist the Japanese pirates in Shanghai, and what is most satisfying is that the friendly armies from all sides are competing to fight the enemy on the front lines, vying to be the first, as if they are deeply afraid that there will be no fighting to do. I remember that when our army implemented resistance on the night of the 28th of last month, the first to make contact were police officers from the Public Security Bureau and a part of the military police. At that time, the 19th Route Army, seeing that the war had begun, was deeply afraid that they would be outnumbered, so they immediately rushed to the front lines and instructed the police officers and military police to take a little rest. As a result, they defeated the strong enemy in one battle. Since then, the Japanese army has been losing repeatedly, and their morale has been declining. In addition, the international sentiment has been deteriorating day by day, and everyone lacks the will to fight. Therefore, when they face the front lines, most of them are perfunctory. Once they are attacked by our army, they will eventually be flanked, disarmed, surrounded, and captured. As for the inferiority of the Japanese army's combat strategies, it is more than what we had expected. Every time we see the Japanese army charging, either they do not charge, or if they charge, rarely does anyone survive. Other shortcomings include wasting ammunition, charging with bent backs, attacking when they should not attack, and retreating when they should not retreat. All of these show that the Japanese army has not experienced real combat. As for our army, it is not like that. The 19th Route Army has participated in internal wars for many years, totaling 47 battles, large and small. Although we dare not say that we are invincible in every attack, the title of an iron army is not accidental. Moreover, this time it is completely external, fighting for the survival of the entire nation, so we do not care about everything. The outcome of victory or defeat can be left to the future. From this, we can see that the vigorous morale of our army is a sure bet.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Red and Blue Cross Societies Bury Fallen Soldiers <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Regimental Commanders and Deputies Weep as They Witness the Interment</p>
<p>The Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association dispatched Yuan Shixing, a rescuer from the Red Cross Society's Relief Team No. 100, to Zhabei yesterday to rescue refugees from danger and carry out burial work. Mr. Yuan, at 9 am yesterday, led a car to the Zhabei Charity Group and, together with Wang Binyan, the director of the Blue Cross Society, began to bury the fallen soldiers. The fallen soldiers included Yan Guisheng, a lieutenant company deputy from the 7th company of the 3rd battalion of the 4th regiment of the 60th division, from Hunan, and soldiers Chen Liyuan, Peng Keyuan, Jiang Zhenbiao, Guo Zhiren, Cai Guangming, Cai Guangrong, Cui Desheng, Jiang Zhengbiao, Fan Shoren, Peng Hanwen, Zhou Yunting, Hu Fu, Chen Sheng, Jin Dafu, Liu Qingshi, Huang Jinchen, Wu Guoyi, Lu Jingbu, and two unnamed individuals. A total of 21 fallen soldiers had sacrificed their lives in the attack on Yongxing Road the day before, capturing seven Japanese steel cannons and thirteen machine guns. Twenty coffins were transported from the Pushan Villa, and another coffin was purchased from the Yangzhou Public Hall and taken to the Quanwan Guild Hall on Zhongxing Road for entombment. Yang Changhuang, the commander of the 4th regiment, and Nie Jing, the deputy commander, wept on the side as they witnessed the entombment, saying that Company Deputy Yan had always been in the forefront of every battle, fearless and extraordinarily loyal and brave, so the enemy fled at the sight of him. In this battle, Japanese soldiers launched a fierce attack on our army's position from Heng Hong Road and Dong Bao Xing Road. Company Deputy Yan even took off his upper clothes, bare-chested, and fought back with a machine gun, shouting to kill the enemy and charging into the enemy's position. The Japanese army was so frightened that they collapsed and fled, and our army won a complete victory. Company Deputy Yan was shot several times, but he still shouted "kill, kill, kill" and continued to advance. They were deeply saddened by this. Wang and Yuan transported the coffins to Pushan Villa for temporary placement, but they were spotted by Japanese aircraft in the sky, which dropped a bomb that exploded in the silk factory opposite the Villa. Wang and Yuan quickly drove back, but the Japanese aircraft chased after them, dropping another bomb at the Sun Temple, which landed a few steps to the right of the car, injuring a small barber's right face. They quickly rescued him into the car and sped away. The Japanese aircraft chased after them to the intersection of Datong Road and Haichang Road, dropping another bomb, destroying an electric pole on the side of the road. The soldiers guarding the area fired their guns, and the Japanese aircraft fled. Three bombs were dropped in total, all very close, but none hit, which was fortunate. Mr. Yuan's car returned to the Zhabei Charity Group and rescued more than 60 people from danger. Except for those who went to relatives on their own, the rest were sent to the temporary relief association for transfer to the mainland market for accommodation. According to Mr. Yuan, when the Japanese aircraft dropped the bombs, they flew very low and must have been able to see the Red Cross flag on the car, but they still chased after and dropped bombs, which shows their extreme barbarity and disregard for international conventions.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Chinese Taxpayers' Association Requests Investigation and Rescue of Stranded Residents <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department, which stated:</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>According to a letter from Mr. Shen of Shenji Grocery Store at No. 1031 Yalu Road, around 7 pm on the 29th of this month, Japanese soldiers suddenly broke into his store, claiming to be searching for something. They wantonly destroyed the store's goods and business equipment. Then, they arrested his uncle, Cheng Zhang, his son, Yao Qing, and the store clerk, Mr. Huang, as well as neighbors He Yunxiang and Qu Ziliang, clerks of the Dekang Wood Shop. They also beat his uncle, Cheng Zhang, until he was bleeding. The location of his store is within the Public Concession, and the protection of citizens and police power belongs to the Public Works Department, the highest authority of the Concession. He always pays taxes and dues on time and has never been in arrears. Now that he has suffered such a disaster, he should request relief from the Public Works Department and find a way to demand that the Japanese army release the five arrested people. We, as the leader of all Chinese taxpayers in the city, sincerely request that you forward a letter to the Public Works Department for negotiation as soon as possible. We are extremely eager to pray for your help.</p>
<p>Also, according to Wang Minxin's statement to the association, his brother, Wu Liansheng, 20 years old, from Xiuning, Anhui, was studying at Yida Firm at No. 1297-8 Wusong Road. He was taken away by the Japanese army on the night of January 29. At the same time, seven other people in the store were also taken away. We request that you forward a letter to the Public Works Department for investigation and rescue.</p>
<p>Also, according to a letter from Li Jiansan, his brother, Li Shengxia, 21 years old, was wearing a black Western suit without a hat and was of medium height and slightly dark complexion. He left No. 20 Broadway Road on the afternoon of January 30 to escape the disaster. He was arrested by Japanese soldiers at the intersection of Tiantong Road and Zha Pu Road. His life and death are still unknown. But his brother is a law-abiding citizen and does not have any weapons. We request that you forward a letter to the Public Works Department for investigation and rescue.</p>
<p>The safety of residents in the Concession should be fully restored by your department, and the aforementioned stranded residents should be investigated and rescued.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>To the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department</p>

<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Lines Continue to Depart: It is reported that today (the 7th), three ships, the Tunan, Xin Ningshao, and Yongxing, will sail to Ningbo, berthing at the China Merchants Jinliyuan Wharf. The Fulong Fengpu and Xin'an will berth at the Ningshao Wharf. It is also reported that the Tunan will provide bread to those who disembarked the day before out of consideration for their poor countrymen. Yesterday, a total of six merchant ships sailed to Ningbo. The ship names are as follows: Ninghai, Ningbo, Xin Beijing, Yingzhou (all of Taikoo Company), Wanzhong, Ningxing (Sanbei Company). All departed at 1:30 pm. There was also the Guangfu, which was also scheduled to sail to Ningbo yesterday, but was unable to depart due to other reasons and was rescheduled to depart early this morning at 9 am, carrying more than 4,000 passengers, who stayed in the cabins last night.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Trains Ran Three Times Yesterday: The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway South Station still ran three passenger trains yesterday: the 36th early express train at 8:00 am, the 40th slow train at 10:00 am, and the 38th medium express train at 4:00 pm. The passengers totaled approximately 1,500 to 1,600 people. The passenger train tickets sold for more than 3,400 yuan. Passenger trains also arrived from Hangzhou three times, but with very few passengers. The last passenger train from Hangzhou still stayed overnight in Xin Zhuang and returned to Shanghai the next morning.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Yesterday's Defense Was More Strict <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Nanshi Imposed Curfew Early: After the Japanese soldiers attempted to land at the Datong Wharf by steamboat the night before last to occupy Nanshi, the military police stationed in Nanshi yesterday tightened their defenses again. Machine guns were set up along the riverbank, and the soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the City's Volunteer Army patrolled day and night. Around 6 pm, the authorities in Nanshi imposed a curfew early again, cutting off traffic. The defenses were extremely tight.</p>
<p>"Abandon Weapons to Enter This Gate": After the arrival of a large number of American soldiers in Shanghai, the defense of the northern district of the Public Concession will be gradually taken over by the American soldiers. In order to prevent Japanese soldiers from fleeing into the Concession after being defeated, several wooden signs about four feet long and one foot wide, inscribed with the eight characters "Abandon Weapons to Enter This Gate," have been specially made and will be attached to the iron gates in various places. Therefore, defeated soldiers who enter the Concession in the future must voluntarily disarm.</p>
<p>French Concession Tightens Defense: In view of the serious situation, the French Concession authorities tightened the defense work of the Concession yesterday and dispatched armored vehicles for defense. The observations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Reinforced Iron Gates in Various Places": The iron gates outside the 16th Pier and Limalu Road are the important passages for Nanshi's Hua-Fa Pilians to enter and exit. After the Japanese plainclothes team attempted to land secretly on the Huangtan (Chinese territory) in Nanshi the night before last, they were driven away by our country's police officers. Therefore, the French authorities added two defensive works inside the iron gate at that place. In addition to the first iron gate, the second was reinforced with wooden stakes and barbed wire, and the third was reinforced with sand and burlap bags. The Bund iron gate was not closed, and vehicles were only allowed to exit and not allowed to enter. The iron gate of 　Limalu Road was tightly closed all day long.</p>
<p>"Recruiting White Russian Police Officers": The French police force recruited a large number of Russian White Russians to serve as police officers. They were trained in the empty yard of the east guard of the Xiafei Road Police Station for days. Part of them has been trained and sent out to guard the station. Yesterday afternoon, an armored vehicle on the Fa Public Hall Road paraded from east to west. A gold-lined Western police officer led the way, followed by four Chinese police officers, the armored vehicle in the middle, and a car with two armed Western soldiers in the back to escort the parade.</p>
<p>"Strengthening Defense of the 16th Pier": In the Nanshi Chinese territory, the area around the 16th Pier has strengthened its defenses since the attempted landing of Japanese plainclothes men at the Nan Wharf the night before last, although they were repelled. The area along the Puyang Jiang Ning Shao Wharf and Dong Men Road Ferry Terminal is close to the French Concession, so the defense works have been stepped up. During the day, the military and police jointly protect the area, and at night, the entire 100+ members of the 1st team of the Hu Nan District Defense Corps are added to patrol all night to ensure thoroughness and protect the local area.</p>
<h3 id="e25">News of Military and Civilian Resistance Against Japan <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan: Brigadier General Weng Zhaoyuan's Message to the Military and Civilians states: Fellow Commanders, Soldiers, and Civilians, the brutal and ferocious Japanese have devoured our Northeast Provinces. Continuing their aggression, they now seek to swallow Shanghai. With insatiable greed and insidious plans, they aim to destroy our entire nation and people. Are we, the upright citizens of the Republic of China, willing to become slaves of the Eastern Barbarians? Are we willing to offer our country to the Japanese for their rule? I believe none of you are willing. Therefore, we must resolve to fight to the death. Now, Japan has decided to send two army divisions to Shanghai and will continue to dispatch warships and aircraft. They intend to engage us in a decisive battle, determined to occupy Shanghai. However, Shanghai is the lifeline of China. If we lose Shanghai, China will be finished. Therefore, we must also resolve to fight them to the death and never allow them to occupy even an inch of our Shanghai territory. How can we preserve Shanghai? How can we deal with the Japanese warships, aircraft, and army? Apart from firmly embracing the great spirit of sacrifice and refusing to retreat a single step, we have various means to achieve our goals. We must shoot down their warships and aircraft one by one. We must disarm their army entirely and capture them completely. To achieve this, we must rely on our spirit of sacrifice. Commanders, soldiers, and civilians, we must earnestly continue to unite. We must earnestly continue our resolve to avenge the humiliation of the Republic of China, to avenge the generations of hatred felt by our 400 million compatriots, to achieve merit, and to create an immortal deed in our great history. We can only start from this moment. We sacrifice, we advance, and we kill all the brutal and ferocious Eastern Barbarian devils!</p>
<p>Liu Guorong: Platoon Leader Liu Guorong of the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company of a certain Regiment of a certain Army Division's Announcement Regarding Injuries: My company departed from Hangzhou on January 27th of this year due to the violent Japanese invasion, immediately joining the Zhabei front line to undertake air defense. After the great battle on the 29th, my company's anti-aircraft artillery alone, in Zhenru, Zhabei, acted in self-defense, resisting the enemy. On February 2nd, enemy aircraft pressed upon our position in successive waves. At that time, I, Guorong, personally served as the gunner, hitting one enemy aircraft with a single shot, causing it to catch fire. Another aircraft circled very low, attempting to drop bombs and strafe downwards with machine guns. As our artillery fired continuously, I was struck by shrapnel and severely injured in both legs. Subsequently, I was rescued by the Red Cross and sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. Recently, my condition has gradually improved. As soon as I fully recover, I will immediately return to the front to kill the enemy. Fearing that my comrades are concerned and have worked hard, I specially express my gratitude. Luo Peihuan and others: Luo Peihuan from Yunnan, Liu Jimin from Sichuan, Wang Shifu from Guizhou, and others wrote, stating: We are motivated by anger for the survival of the Party and the nation and have organized anti-Japanese propaganda and weapons. Any member of our nation with these can defend themselves and safeguard the country, etc.</p>
<p>Zhang Zilian and others: The National Salvation Association of the Republic of China established a Military Affairs Committee, with Mr. Zhang Zilian as Chairman and Mr. Wang Hanliang as Deputy. Mr. Tao Zhongxun was appointed as the Commander of the Second Route Army of the National Salvation Army of the Republic of China, and Yu Yizhong as the Deputy. Since receiving the appointment, Mr. Tao and Mr. Yu have spared no effort in planning and assembling, and have reported to the 19th Route Army for record. After several days, everything has been arranged. It is now scheduled to assemble today (the 7th) at the Sanyu Girls' School on Hengtong Road, Zhabei. There are approximately over a thousand people, with five to six hundred firearms and one to two hundred members of the broadsword team. Apart from messengers and service soldiers, after assembly, they will be absolutely under the command of the Military Affairs Committee and will advance to the front line to help the 19th Route Army kill the enemy.</p>
<p>General Labor Union: The General Labor Union's Message to the Soldiers of the Nation states: Urgent Notice to All Army, Navy, and Air Force Generals and Fellow Soldiers Throughout the Nation: The Japanese militarists, violating international law and disrupting world peace, have already occupied our Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces and are now bombing our Shanghai. Thanks to our 19th Route Army and the generals and soldiers at the front, who have sacrificed themselves for the country and defended our territory, bloody battles in Shanghai have repeatedly achieved extraordinary feats. All of our people cannot help but be deeply respectful. The extraordinary actions of the 19th Route Army not only elevate the position of our entire nation but also enhance the integrity of all soldiers throughout the country. Fellow soldiers throughout the nation, how can we dare to lag behind in our patriotic fervor? At this critical moment on the front line, it is time for courageous sons of iron and blood to perform meritorious service for the country. We must all be prepared, go together to kill the enemy, bravely defend the country, and die with glory. Our nation expects nothing less from all our fellow soldiers at this time. Only through this action can all our fellow soldiers create immortal achievements that will be praised for generations to come. Please consider this carefully. Sincerely, The Shanghai General Labor Union.</p>

<p>15,000 People Awaiting Relief from Hunger and Cold: The Investigation Team of the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association's Relief Section is investigating matters. As of today, the city has established 33 refugee shelters, housing a total of over 5,000 refugees, with the Huxi Public Recreation Society sheltering the most, approximately over 6,000 people. Most of the refugees in each shelter escaped alone, possessing nothing but the clothes on their backs. At this time of biting cold winds, they have no bedding at all. Many are falling ill due to the cold. They are suffering from both hunger and cold, and some are simply waiting to die. It is hoped that benevolent individuals from all walks of life will empathize with their hunger and suffering and generously donate money and old clothes as much as possible. Donors can deliver their contributions to the Association's office at No. 66 Sichuan Road to save dying compatriots and create immeasurable blessings. It is reported that the Association has now received over 60,000 yuan in donations from various sectors.</p>
<p>Red Cross Efforts in Relief: The Chinese Red Cross, at 8:00 AM yesterday, the second relief team leader, Xue Zhenyi, together with the tenth team leader, Zhang Zhenyan, went to Baoxing Road, Tiantong'an Road, Gonghexin Road, Song Park Road, and other places for relief.

Yu Songyun of the sixth team arrived at Tiantong'an Road and Baotong Road at 7:00 AM. As there was no fighting in the front, only one dead soldier was found and sent to the headquarters of the fourth regiment. They then patrolled around Dachan and returned. In Dachan, they picked up an unexploded shell and sent it to the American military camp at Shanbanqiao Bridge for safekeeping. Wu Yunqing, the leader of the ninth team, rescued two men, two women, and two children in Yongxing Road and Zhenru, Zhabei, at 9:00 AM, all of whom were injured by bombs.

<p>At 9:00 PM on the 5th, the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the Chinese Red Cross on Guangqi Road in the city learned of sporadic gunfire at the Datong Wharf and immediately dispatched relief teams to search and rescue. They went to Zhonghua Road, where stray bullets flew overhead, fortunately without injuring anyone. On the morning of the 6th, they heard gunfire in Dongjiadu at 3:00 AM and sent relief team members by car to the scene to carry out rescue operations at dawn. They found Wang Fu, a 34-year-old man from Jiangbei, living on a small boat at the Gongyi Wharf, who had a gunshot wound to his right foot. He was escorted to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. In the attic of an attached house, they found a male corpse who had been struck by a stray bullet and had already died. There was nothing that could be done.</p>
<p>Red Swastika Society Rescues Wounded Soldiers: The World Red Swastika Society's rear hospital at Ximen Xieqiao rescued a large number of wounded soldiers yesterday, totaling over a hundred people. It is said that the Society's ambulances can pass through Xinzhazhao Bridge and other roads, making rescue very convenient. The Society plans to set up a second rear hospital nearby to facilitate accommodation. The Society's refugee shelter is located at the Shandong Guild Hall on Luban Road.</p>
<p>Continued Record of Jisheng Society Relief Efforts: The Jisheng Society's relief team, led by Team Leader Ling Youguang, accompanied by team members Zhou Lihuan, Pan Baojing, etc., yesterday (the 5th) afternoon, traveled by car to Datong Road, Yongxing Road, Qiujiang Road, and the intersection of Baoshan Road, and rescued wounded soldiers Wang Hongguang, Li Feiguang, Wang Mingcai, Zhong Jinlin, Yang Shoulin, Xu Wenxiang, etc., and one unidentified person in the midst of gunfire.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association is a joint organization of leaders from all sectors of the city. In particular, the relief section is very active in relieving refugees. Yesterday, the Association and the Wartime Refugee Temporary Relief Association reached an agreement to divide labor and cooperate to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The Relief Association's letter to the Maintenance Association is recorded as follows: "Respected Sirs, Mr. Li Zushen, Standing Committee Member and Director-General of our Association, mentioned that your Association and our Association should divide labor and cooperate on relief matters. We are extremely grateful for your kindness. Our Association has already dispatched personnel to the bombed areas of Zhabei and Hongkou to bravely rescue our compatriots in distress and has established eight accommodation centers and is still working to expand them to do our best. We have also sent personnel to Baoshan, Taicang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jinshan, Songjiang, Changshu, and Jiading counties to discuss the establishment of inland shelters to facilitate evacuation and avoid congestion. All required expenses and food are extremely insufficient and urgently needed. We are writing to respectfully request that you investigate and generously provide relief to save dying compatriots and create immeasurable blessings."</p>
<h3 id="e28">Relief Work of Various Bureau Offices <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(1) Dispatch personnel to Suzhou, Wuxi, Yixing, Changzhou, Huzhou, and other places to contact and encourage the opening of as many ships as possible staying in various places to Shanghai for the transportation of refugees. (2) Dispatch personnel to investigate the city's grain situation and try to transport grain from Nanshi into the concession. (3) Investigate false fundraising. (4) Send the sick refugees rescued from North Sichuan Road to the Red Cross for treatment. (5) Order various charitable organizations to actively handle the relief of refugees and report at any time.</p>
<p>Relief Work of the YWCA: The YWCA has been engaged in relief work since the violent Japanese invasion, providing the Tongde Hospital with doctors, medical equipment, and relief supplies worth over 300 yuan. They have personally gone to the front to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees from danger and sent them to the rear for treatment. They have also asked many boarders and several nurses who have taken refuge in the YWCA's Diswei Road dormitory to make relief supplies every day for the Red Cross and various hospitals. The Shanghai Municipal Maintenance Association has also sent materials for the YWCA to make and use. They have also joined with various Christian organizations to form a wartime refugee shelter at the mainland market on Nanjing Road. Several YWCA staff members go there to serve. As of yesterday, the YWCA has received over 1,700 yuan in donations from various sectors. It is hoped that more donations will be received to continue the work and carry out follow-up matters.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Social Bureau Orders the Sanshan Guild Hall to Shelter Refugees <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The violent Japanese rampage has hit Zhabei the hardest. The artillery fire is continuous, and the suffering of our compatriots in distress is difficult to describe. The city's Social Bureau and various charitable organizations are making joint efforts to provide relief to refugees and are sparing no effort in setting up shelters. It has recently been reported that several hundred fellow Fujianese, including Tongxiang Zhen, went to the Social Bureau to complain that the Sanshan Guild Hall on Sima Road refused to shelter fellow refugees from Zhabei and specially hired the Hesheng ship to Min, selling tickets for 600 yuan at 7.5 yuan each, more than double the price of ordinary tickets, under the pretext of helping fellow villagers. The full package price for the ship is only 3,000 yuan, and the total ticket revenue can be 4,500 yuan. It is called helping fellow villagers, but it is no different from robbing a burning house. They requested that relief be provided. The Social Bureau has strictly ordered the Sanshan Guild Hall to quickly use the entire building as a shelter for Fujianese refugees and to reduce the price of tickets to provide general relief. In order to provide relief to refugees, the Social Bureau specially dispatched staff members Wang Bing and Jiang Zhiyong to Songjiang, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Xiashi, and Hangzhou a few days ago to discuss matters related to sheltering refugees. Mr. Wang and Mr. Jiang returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing their mission. The results of the discussion were very satisfactory. It is reported that Songjiang and Jiashan can each accommodate 2,000 people, Jiaxing can accommodate 6,000 people, Xiashi can accommodate 1,000 people, and Hangzhou can accommodate tens of thousands of people. The refugees' sustenance is enthusiastically donated by philanthropists in each area.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Large Batch of Guangdong Refugees Loaded onto Ships to Return Home <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association immediately went to the war zones to transport a large number of refugees out of danger after the Japanese military's atrocities and set up two shelters. It is learned that the Association, at the request of the refugees, has dispatched ships to transport them back to their native Guangdong. It has now rented the Taikoo Yangxing's Jiaxing ship, which will carry a large number of refugees away from Shanghai today and tomorrow. Guangdong people remaining in Shanghai who wish to return home can request assistance from the Association.</p>
<p>Pusong District Establishes Maintenance Association: The Pusong District Municipal Committee Office, District Party Headquarters, Public Security Bureau, Security Regiment, and the Huxi Municipal Association, in view of the fact that since the outbreak of the war, thousands of people from the disaster areas of Zhabei, Hongkou, and Jiangwan have fled to the Huxi area and are in a pitiful state of displacement, held an emergency joint meeting yesterday to discuss relief measures. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) Organize the Pusong District Local Maintenance Committee. (2) Elect staff. (3) Location: The general office is temporarily located at Shicun Primary School, and temporary mobile shelters are organized at the Guandi Temple Winery and Shicun Primary School. (4) Expenses: Temporarily borrowed by the Municipal Committee Office Security Regiment. It is reported that 1,220,000 people have been accommodated, and the work is extremely intensive. Also, it is reported that the Municipal Committee Office has prepared ten baskets of bread and 160 catties of biscuits to reward the front-line soldiers and sent them to the front to express condolences.</p>
<p>Municipal Boy Scouts Add Shelters: The Battlefield Service Group of the Municipal Boy Scouts Council has previously set up eight shelters for disaster victims, accommodating a total of over 2,600 disaster victims. As all places are overcrowded and the Japanese side's atrocities have not ended, the number of disaster victims will inevitably increase day by day. Therefore, the group yesterday (the 4th) obtained the consent of the Continental Bank to use a part of the newly built Continental Market at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road, which has been renovated, as the group's ninth shelter, which can accommodate about 1,000 people. However, the number of people accommodated is too large, and food is insufficient for distribution. Although it is currently being supplemented by various parties, it can barely be maintained. If the number of people increases again in a day or two, the lack of food will be even more severe. In order to maintain the safety of disaster victims, the group intends to raise funds from all parties. Yesterday (the 4th), three teams were dispatched, and the results were very good. It is deeply hoped that enthusiastic compatriots and patriotic people from all walks of life will donate as much as possible to benefit the disaster victims. In addition, the group's fourth shelter, located in Kuangrentang, has accommodated over 220 disaster victims. A batch of personnel from the two district party headquarters has now joined the shelter to assist in the work. In view of the fact that the disaster victims are all poor people and the houses are very shabby, special attention is paid to hygiene to avoid severe epidemics. It is specially stipulated that two people in each room are responsible for cleaning. At the same time, the daily war news is reported to the disaster victims and appropriate training is given.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Empty Houses on Chengdu Road Can Shelter Refugees <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Business Company Manager Hua Jingting has always been a strong advocate for charitable causes. After the Japanese invasion and the start of the war, in view of the fact that refugees in the disaster area have nowhere to go, he specially vacated two large Western-style houses at No. 2 Chengdu Road, north of Nanjing Road, which are the property of the company, for sheltering refugees without taking any rent. The second shelter of the Changzhou Fellow Villagers Association has borrowed a part of it, but the house can accommodate over 2,000 people and currently only has over 200 people. Therefore, there are many remaining rooms. If any relief organizations need shelters, they can contact Han Zongqi of the Changzhou Fellow Villagers Association shelter in the house.</p>
<p>The Refugee Repatriation Issue is Settled: The Wartime Refugee Relief Association plans to escort refugees to safe areas. Yesterday, the Special City Party Executive Committee dispatched personnel to Qingpu and Jinshan counties to settle the matter. As for the transport ship, it is currently borrowing the Pujiang ferry from the City Government. Once the loan is approved, it can be sent. The Association's reply to the original letter from the City Party Headquarters is recorded below: "Respected Sirs, we have received your letter of the 4th regarding the transportation of refugees. We are very grateful to Mr. Wu Fei and Mr. Zhang Xiaotong of your Association for contacting Qingpu and Jinshan counties regarding the number of people to be accommodated and the expenses required. We are now writing to the Joint Office of the City Government Bureaus to temporarily borrow the Pujiang ferry for transportation. Except that once the ship is borrowed, it will be transported on time, and we will follow your instructions and inform your Association one day in advance for review and transfer." (Datong News Agency)</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Chase Ambulance: The City's Wartime Refugee Temporary Relief Association, after consultation with the Public Concession Board of Works and the Japanese Consulate, agreed that the Concession authorities would send the International Merchants Corps or Japanese police to escort the vehicles. At 3:20 PM yesterday, eleven ambulances were loaded with refugees on Diswei Road to escape danger. When driving through Gonghexin Road, they were unexpectedly seen by Japanese aircraft operating in the sky, which circled around the front, rear, left, and right of the vehicles. Fearing that they would drop bombs, the vehicles accelerated forward to avoid them, while flying the Red Cross flag to request them to cease hostile actions. However, the Japanese aircraft disregarded humanitarianism and dropped a bomb on the ambulance. Fortunately, the technique was not precise, and the vehicles were not damaged. The bomb fell on the nearby Gonghexin Road cemetery, burying several tombs and creating a crater of about a zhang deep.</p>
<p>Merchants Act Righteously: The Yipin Kiln Yard Affiliated Transportation Company of the Fanwangdu Bureau Family Bridge, in view of the fact that the vehicles used by the Chinese Red Cross to rescue wounded soldiers and civilians on the front line are insufficient for distribution, which hinders progress, specially donated all of its vehicles on the 4th. The gasoline car drivers are also supplied by the company, and Dachang Company donated 200 gallons of gasoline. Shareholder Lu Changgui personally drove the car to Zhabei and the front line.</p>
<p>Shelter for School Students in War Zone</p>
<p>Lu Xirong, Zhang Dingxin, and others in the education sector have purchased a school building and plan to run Donglu Middle School. Everything has been in progress. Now, due to the occurrence of the Shanghai Incident, most of the schools in the war zone have been destroyed by Japan, and young students have been displaced, which is very pitiful. They have specially set up a "Shelter for School Students in War Zone." Any affected student in the war zone with proper proof can go directly to the school for lodging. Except for food, which is self-sufficient, no fees are charged. In order to remedy the students' studies, academic experts are invited to give lectures and physical and military training. The address of the shelter is No. 570 Xujiahui Road (west of Dapu Bridge) in the French Concession. It is reported that Mr. Lu and Mr. Zhang are both enthusiastic about education and have many years of experience. They will provide great benefits to the affected youth.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese army attacked Zhabei on the 28th of last month, the Hongkou area has become a terrifying zone. In recent days, the Japanese army has continued to burn and slaughter in the area, which is inhumane. If the authorities of the concession do not take effective measures as soon as possible, our citizens will probably have no survivors in the future. The arson situations in the past two days are compiled as follows: No. 3597 Dithaway Road caught fire at 11:00 a.m. on the 5th, and three houses were burned down. No. 244 Bazilu Road caught fire at around 7:00 p.m. on the 5th and was also burned down. The Meisheng Photo Studio on East Huade Road was burned down by two rooms on the evening of the 5th. Minsheng Middle School, Sanduo Lane, Qiujiang Road, North Sichuan Road, was burned down by four rooms at 11:00 a.m. on the 6th. The Hongkou Fire Brigade went to each place and put out the fire.</p>

<p>A Letter Was Sent to the Automobile Rental Industry Association Yesterday for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce reported yesterday that some unscrupulous merchants have privately rented cars to Japanese bandits for a daily rent of 30 yuan. The association believes that since we are in a time of war, and the Japanese are enticing them with heavy profits, it is inevitable that car industry merchants will be fooled.

<p>Since the outbreak of the war between China and Japan, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the First Special District Local Court on North Zhejiang Road have been in an extremely important location. Therefore, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps ordered dozens of members of various nationalities to open and station in the court to take on the defense. However, the court is very close to the North Railway Station, and there may be unexpected dangers. Therefore, the presidents of the two courts decided to temporarily transfer all female prisoners in the women's prison attached to the court who have been sentenced to more than five years to the women's prison of the Second Special District Local Court in the French Concession. An agreement has been reached with the Second Special Court. At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, the bailiffs hired a large truck from the China Moving Company to escort all important female criminals onto the truck and drove to the Second Special Court Women's Prison in the French Concession for detention. Those who are still undecided and those who have been sentenced to lighter sentences are still detained in the First Special Court Prison.</p>

<p>This time, the ferocious Japanese bandits used fierce artillery fire to massacre our compatriots in Zhabei. Relying on the loyal and brave fight of our 19th Route Army, they have been retreating for days. However, the Japanese bandits are like wolves and may resort to poison gas and poison gas cannons as a last resort. I have read in a book that there is a very simple method of personal protection, which is copied and published for the needs of our compatriots. The method is as follows: 1. When poison gas occurs, quickly wet a piece of cloth, a handkerchief, or gauze (with water, tea, or alcohol) and cover the mouth and nose so that the air you breathe passes through this wet cloth, which will definitely reduce its toxicity. Even if the strongest poison gas invades, using this method to defend yourself can at least prevent you from dying. 2. Use a glass bottle without a bottom to fill it with moderately moist soil, insert the bottle mouth into your mouth to breathe, and plug your nostrils with your hands. However, you must pay attention to the moisture of the soil in the bottle. If it is dry, it will be ineffective. If you use excessively wet soil, you will not be able to breathe through it.</p>

<p>Order to Remove the Bullets</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, a Western child, Lai Paipa, a messenger of the Human Resources Committee of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, was ten or six years old. At 4:00 p.m. on Friday, a member of the B-Team of the corps, Mr. Jin, raised his gun and pretended to shoot at the child. Unexpectedly, his hand touched the mechanism and the bullet flew out, hitting the child. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment, but died in less than 30 minutes. It is reported that a moment before the accident, the headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps had issued an order requiring members to remove the bullets when they were not on duty. Mr. Jin had just returned from leave and did not know the new order, so he accidentally caused this disaster while playing. On the same day, a member of the Russian team in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was injured by stray bullets in the Baoshan Road area.</p>

For this reason, internal business continued as normal, and after the markets reopened the businesswomen felt that storing money was more inconvenient, so they deposited in droves. The employees were busier than usual and the business day extended as a result.</p>

<h3 id="e45">The Japanese Government Is Still Planning to Expand the War <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>A Large Number of Army Troops Are Transferred to Shanghai</p>
<p>Statement Not to Invade British Interests</p>
<p>(Washington) The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, notified the State Department today that a division of the Japanese Army, totaling 9,000 men, is now being sent to Shanghai from Japan. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The important statement regarding sending troops to Shanghai was originally scheduled to be announced today, but the cabinet wanted to reconsider the required number of troops and reduce the original budget, so the announcement was postponed. Although the authorities still do not allow the disclosure of details of the troop dispatch, a brief news report on the troop dispatch has been approved by the censors. According to official sources, Ambassador to China Shigemitsu advocated keeping this matter strictly secret for the time being, fearing that the Chinese army would launch a large-scale offensive upon hearing of it in order to eliminate this Japanese Marine Corps, whose casualties have exceeded one-tenth. The Japanese government has not even informed its overseas representatives of the troop dispatch. Therefore, Ambassador to the United States Debuchi recently declared to the US Secretary of State that Japan does not want to send troops to Shanghai. The Minister of the Navy told Reuters that the Marines in Shanghai are few in number and continue to engage with an enemy ten times their size, and are extremely fatigued. The Japanese government has now decided to send troops to Shanghai to support the Marines and drive out the Chinese army near Shanghai. Japan has absolutely no intention of occupying land or harming British interests in the Yangtze River. Once the current work is completed, the troops can be withdrawn. Japan's dispatch of troops to Shanghai may indeed be misunderstood, but it is hoped that after the Japanese army arrives in Shanghai, the Chinese army will retreat without fighting. Even if war is unavoidable, Britain can rest assured that the operational area of the Japanese army will be strictly limited. Reuters asked about the scope of the battlefield, and the Minister of the Navy replied that it would extend about twenty or thirty li, but would never expand. Japan's view of the Shanghai Incident is completely different from its view of the Manchurian Incident. If Britain can understand this, it can clearly see that there is no need to question Japan's intentions. Manchuria is a matter of life and death for Japan, while Shanghai is just an occasional incident. Japan is eager to conclude the Shanghai affair as soon as possible so that it can withdraw its troops. It is hoped that Shanghai will follow the Tianjin method, where international coordination does not allow Chinese troops to be stationed in designated areas. If so, Shanghai can be permanently free from the possibility of renewed conflict. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a certain senior official, the Japanese government will issue a statement in London, Paris, Geneva, and Shanghai, which will include the statement that the reinforcements sent to Shanghai will be withdrawn once the objectives are achieved. It is heard that the statement aims to explain Japan's reasons for having to send reinforcements to Shanghai and to dispel the misunderstandings of various governments, as various governments have expressed disappointment to Japan upon hearing the news of the Japanese government sending troops. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e46">London <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>All circles are uneasy about the news that the Japanese government has decided to send an army division to Shanghai. The Foreign Office is silent on the issue and does not make a single statement. The Prime Ministers of the Great Powers are now exchanging views on what kind of note should be submitted to Japan next, and are earnestly debating whether it is useful to continue to make polite protests. The Manchester Guardian stated that Japan's aggression can only be stopped by the Great Powers that are members of the League of Nations resolving to implement the articles of the League of Nations charter. It also said that world opinion is almost unanimous against Japan. At least let the League of Nations have a try. The Times now believes that the Japanese authorities have approached a group of Chinese bureaucrats, and the result may be the formation of a local government that favors Japan. The newspaper also stated in cold tones that the Japanese naval admiral's involvement in Zhabei has only resulted in the massacre of Chinese civilians, great losses for the Japanese army, great complications in the international situation, and the loss of most of the world's sympathy that the Japanese army originally enjoyed. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that the Japanese statement explains the reasons why it had to send reinforcements as follows: 1. Japanese sailors are not strong enough to resist the Chinese army, which is ten times their number, and need to rest. 2. The purpose of this move is the same as the increase in the number of troops stationed in Shanghai by the Great Powers. 3. This move is limited to protecting the interests and safety of the 30,000 Japanese living in Shanghai and fulfilling Japan's responsibility for the defense of the concession. 4. The statement stated that if the Chinese army does not obstruct the Japanese army from fulfilling its duties, the Japanese army will not attack the Chinese army. 5. The statement argued that the Shanghai case is completely different from the Manchurian case. The Japanese authorities said that the Great Powers have accused the Japanese army of using the Public Concession as a base for attacks, and the only way to avoid this is to increase the strength of the Japanese army, as the current Marine Corps is too thin. There is no other way to attack from the concession. Japan clearly hopes that after the Japanese reinforcements arrive in Shanghai, the Chinese army will retreat when it sees the opportunity, but if the Chinese army does not retreat on its own, the Japanese army will force it to retreat to a safe distance.

<p>U.S. State Department Studying New Proposals</p>
<p>(Washington) Japan's inability to fully accept the proposals of the powers was expected in political circles, but the tone of Tokyo's reply and its refusal to cease sending additional troops to Shanghai are particularly disappointing and cause increased concern. Some quarters speculate from this that the Japanese government's plan is ultimately to isolate Shanghai or occupy Nanjing and other locations along the Yangtze River, in order to force China to recognize its occupation of Manchuria. U.S. Army and Navy circles hope for a stronger policy and express pessimism, some even fearing that Japan has ambitions to control all of North China. According to political circles, the only hopeful aspect of the current situation is that the Japanese government genuinely wants to avoid a breakdown in negotiations and has indicated a willingness to accept other proposals. However, this is not a cause for great joy, as Washington does not see any new proposals that can be put forward. The State Department is currently studying this matter and is constantly consulting with Navy leaders. Japan took three days to respond after receiving the U.S. proposal. The U.S. seems to want to allow ample time to liaise with other countries. Furthermore, with British Prime Minister MacDonald ill and news from the Parisian press saying that the French government has re-notified Japan, firmly stating that the nature of Japan's reply is unacceptable, both of these factors allow the State Department to remain calm and work jointly with the powers. The French attitude is particularly welcome, as it was previously widely rumored in some U.S. quarters that France and Japan had a secret agreement. This kind of rumor is especially prevalent in Congress. U.S. public opinion is deeply concerned about the situation and people are very uneasy. However, because Hoover does not approve of any action that could lead to conflict, public opinion has softened. The economic decline has further contributed to a calming of public opinion. This is why the U.S. has repeatedly stated that the sole responsibility of U.S. troops is to protect American citizens. Although the peace proposal is still the government's top priority, preparations are being made to send reinforcements immediately, as the U.S. is the leader in international action, and therefore all preparatory measures must be taken. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) Shanghai Japanese Navy Rear Admiral Shiozawa, in an interview on a warship with a Shanghai correspondent from the New York Times, said that the fighting in Shanghai could end in two more days of Japanese bombing. The latest Japanese reinforcements include many field guns, which will be used to attack the area north of Shanghai in order to drive out Chinese troops from the area near the International Settlement. After that, we will advance rapidly, with eighteen large aircraft participating in the operation. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The situation of the Sino-Japanese incident has once again caused concern among government authorities. However, government officials are maintaining a very tight-lipped attitude regarding the progress of events. It was previously rumored that the United States and other countries had notified Japan that if it did not withdraw its invading troops from China by February 11, an economic boycott of Japan would be implemented. The U.S. State Department has strongly denied this claim. The New York Times said that although the U.S. State Department indicated that it would not engage in any new negotiations with the Japanese government before next week, British Ambassador to the U.S. Lindsay, after meeting with U.S. Undersecretary of State Castle, seemed to indicate that he would present a new counter-proposal to Japan. The People's Forum newspaper said that British Ambassador Lindsay did not believe that Japan's mobilization could become a reality. Senator Democratic Party member Knorey declared that Japan did not want to fight, and the United States had no reason to be drawn into the vortex of war. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Hardliners Still Prevail</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's regular cabinet meeting was held, where Foreign Minister Yoshizawa reported on the response to the three-nation proposal, sought the agreement of all cabinet members, and held important discussions on future policy directions. Army Minister Araki and Navy Minister Osumi advocated a tough diplomatic stance, while Finance Minister Takahashi, focusing on the economic standpoint, argued that a very cautious approach should be adopted in policy towards China. The two sides debated fiercely at the time, and the situation was tense. It is unknown whether this will lead to a new situation domestically. (5th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, the rumors of a political crisis in the cabinet here are untrue. Yesterday's Nichi Nichi Shimbun had alarming news on this matter, but inquiries to those within the bureau learned that this news was based on the fact that the Finance Minister initially opposed sending troops to Shanghai, which would increase the burden of military expenditure, because the Chinese army was about to collapse. However, the Finance Minister later realized the necessity of continuing to send troops in view of recent developments, and therefore no longer opposes it. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army has submitted a budget for the expenses required for the Shanghai Incident. The Ministry of Finance, upon receiving the budgets from the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the expenses required for the Shanghai Incident, intends to approve an emergency financial plan immediately. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Inukai issued the following opinion today regarding the current situation: The current Shanghai Incident was originally a measure of self-defense (?), and we have no choice but to cooperate with the powers to maintain order (?). If there is even one mistake, we will face a greater danger than the Russo-Japanese War in the past. Therefore, regardless of whether the general election is successful or not, in order to stabilize people's hearts, we have decided to change our policies to seek political stability, so that we can follow policies to renew the face of the industrial economy. However, if public opinion is not consistent, neither the deflationary policy nor the foreign policy can be implemented. Today, Japan should immediately change its policy of amity towards China and Russia, and earnestly hope that politicians, with burning sincerity, will shake hands with China.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged serious protests with the British and American ministers regarding the use of the concessions by Japanese troops as bases for military operations. Regarding the note, according to a telegram from the Shanghai Municipal Government on the 3rd, the Japanese army's attacks on Chinese troops are still using the concessions as bases. Armed Japanese soldiers have been passing through the concessions daily and heading to western Shanghai and other places, increasing the concerns of our troops. Protests have been lodged with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement. It has been found that the International Settlement allows Japan to use the settlement as a base for military operations. This Ministry already sent a note to your country's consul and military officer stationed in Shanghai on January 31, asking them not to allow the Japanese army to use the settlement to attack areas under Chinese jurisdiction. However, according to the report on the 3rd mentioned above, the authorities of the International Settlement are still allowing armed Japanese soldiers to pass through the settlement and head to western Shanghai and other places, increasing the concerns of Chinese troops, which is highly inappropriate. Accordingly, this Ministry again requests your Excellency to immediately investigate the note sent on January 31, deal with the matter strictly, and provide a reply. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, the Japanese Navy Landing Force in Shanghai has arbitrarily and illegally arrested and imprisoned civilians. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a note to the Japanese Minister, lodging a serious protest. The original text is as follows: Regarding the note, according to a telegram from the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Japanese Navy Landing Force is arbitrarily arresting Chinese civilians, imposing private punishments, or even killing them, in parts of the International Settlement and areas beyond the boundaries of the roads, as well as other locations in Zhabei. It is reported that hundreds of people are still being illegally imprisoned. The investigation found that the Japanese Navy Landing Force has arbitrarily arrested Chinese civilians, killing or injuring them, or imposing private punishments. Hundreds of people are still being detained. This not only violates international law but also violates humanitarian principles. Accordingly, a serious protest is lodged, requesting your Excellency to instruct the commander of the Japanese fleet to release the illegally arrested civilians, punish the criminals who injured the civilians, and investigate and deal with the matter as soon as possible and provide a reply. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that it had, based on information provided by the Shanghai Municipal Government, sent a serious protest to Japanese Minister Shigemitsu, accusing the Japanese Navy Landing Force of mistreating and injuring Chinese residents in the Shanghai International Settlement, and had also sent letters to the British and American ministers in China, protesting against the Japanese army's use of the International Settlement as a base for attacking Zhabei.

<h3 id="e52">Luo Wengan's Statement <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the statement by Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on the situation in Shanghai, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan issued an important statement as follows: The integrity of China's territorial sovereignty has been guaranteed by successive international conventions. There is no reason why the issue of the three northeastern provinces and the issue of Shanghai can be resolved separately within the scope of the territorial sovereignty of the entire country. Moreover, Japan's policy of force against China is also comprehensive. Its military actions are based on this consistent policy. The actions of Chinese troops within Chinese territory to defend their territory are legitimate and justifiable acts in accordance with the law and public reason. There is no question of militarism whatsoever. What China is now enduring is something that no sovereign state can tolerate. If any country were in the same situation as China, its actions would not be limited to the scope of China's legitimate defense. The reason why China is enduring this is to maintain world peace and international conventions. The reason why China has no choice but to resist, in addition to exercising the right of legitimate defense permitted by law, is precisely to maintain world peace and the dignity of international conventions, so as not to allow any violent country to destroy them completely. I urge the world to recognize that Japan's military aggression in the three northeastern provinces since September 18, especially the recent attacks along the Chinese Eastern Railway, the attacks on Zhabei in Shanghai, the continued outbreak of hostilities, the unrestricted aerial bombardment, the recent shelling of the capital, and the large-scale attacks on the Wusong Forts, are all serious acts of war that cannot be concealed. China has now fully accepted the proposals put forward by its American and British allies. However, Japan's military actions have become even more intense. For the sake of the League of Nations resolutions, the Non-Aggression Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the recent measures taken by friendly nations to guarantee peace, it is hoped that the international community will take practical and effective measures to guarantee world peace and the dignity of conventions.

Subsequently, the Japanese Military Police Department sent personnel to take back the military police officers, firearms, and bicycles.

<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>Telegram from Chicago To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office: The following telegram is translated and sent to the commander of the 19th Route Army. We are celebrating your army's brave fight against the enemy and wish you the final victory. The Chinese Students Association of the University of Chicago</p>
<p>Telegram from Perak To the officers and men of the 19th Route Army and the Wusong Fort: The enemy army is invading Shanghai. Your efforts to kill the enemy and your loyalty in defending the territory are deeply appreciated by the entire nation. We especially send this telegram of condolence. The Entire Overseas Chinese Community of Perak, Shi Zhaoyuan Ma,</p>
<p>Telegram from London To the Shen Bao, forwarded to the soldiers on the front line: The Japanese invaders are slaughtering and burning in Shanghai. Everyone admires your efforts to kill the enemy. Please continue to fight to the end to protect our territory. The General Assembly of Overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom</p>
<p>(Telegram from Xinyang) To all newspaper offices: The Japanese devils' policy of active aggression since they occupied our Shenyang has long been known to the world. Our central government has sought to preserve the overall situation and has repeatedly tolerated them, awaiting the sanctions of the League of Nations. However, they have become more and more demanding, even attacking our Zhabei, invading our defense lines, slaughtering our people, and burning our houses after we accepted their demands, disregarding humanity and destroying peace. This is a deep hatred for the whole country, and especially a disgrace for the military. I, Fang, bearing the guilt in southern Henan and responsible for suppressing the communists, was enraged upon hearing the bad news. I believe that the brilliant descendants of the divine land and the bright rivers and mountains, passed down from the Yellow Emperor to this day for more than four thousand years, should not be allowed to be ruined by the hands of today's people. Since the sun and the moon are lost, I am willing to die with them. While there is still a breath, how can I be willing to be a slave? I have already encouraged the soldiers to quickly quell the communist rebellion. At the same time, I am preparing the horses and sharpening the weapons, waiting for later orders, and I will not hesitate to go through fire and water. I also telegraphed the officers and men of each army to fight together and strive for survival, and I will never allow the territory to change color or the nation to be sunk, so as not to cause endless shame to the world. I write this with grief while resting on my spears. Zhang Fang, Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Route Army, bows with his seal.</p>
<p>(Telegram from Nanning) To all newspaper offices, forwarded to General Commander Jiang of the 19th Route Army, Brother Jingran, Division Commander Cai, Brother Xianchu, Division Commander Dai, Brother Xiaosi, and all armed comrades: To all newspaper offices: The violent Japanese started a war in Shanghai. Fortunately, all comrades defended themselves properly, thwarted their fierce attacks, fought for the personality of the Chinese nation, and defended the territory of the Republic of China. The merit lies with the party and the country, and the whole world admires it. I, Chongxi, humbly hold the position of commander and am in a remote border area, unable to provide immediate assistance. I am extremely ashamed. I have reorganized my army and requested orders from the central government to go to the national crisis together. I respectfully send this telegram to congratulate you and wish you victory. Your brother, Bai Chongxi, bows at dawn.</p>
<p>(Telegram from Xuzhou) To all newspaper offices: I have just sent a telegram to the State Council and the Military Affairs Department, which reads: "I believe that since the violent Japanese invaded the west and attacked our three northeastern provinces, they have continued to advance. Recently, they have driven their fleet straight in, landed by sea, provoked incidents in Shanghai, killed and burned, and done everything. I am filled with anger and my heart is torn upon hearing this. The Japanese are invading by force, disregarding public morality and law, and treating us as if we were to be destroyed. All those with blood in their veins cannot but feel pain. Now they are entering our hinterland, and if we do not try to resist, we will see immediate danger. I am a soldier and have a responsibility to defend the country. Driven by my blood, how can I bear to sit idly by and watch the country fall? For the sake of restoring our territory, for the sake of preserving our personality, for the sake of washing away the national humiliation, and for the sake of raising our international status, I swear to fight the irreconcilable Japanese to the death. I have already prepared the horses and sharpened the weapons, ready to go. I beg you to issue an order quickly, so that my troops can be the vanguard of the aid to Shanghai. The troops will be mobilized in the morning and set out in the evening. At this time of national crisis and survival, it is the day for my comrades to die on the battlefield. Although the Japanese army relies on the most advanced material to carry out its invasion, we have the spirit of certain death to resist. We and the enemy are irreconcilable, and life and death are not to be considered. I pray that you will approve and show your respect." I respectfully report this telegram and ask you to examine it. Ma Hongkui bows.</p>
<p>(Telegram from Changsha) To all newspaper offices: The violent Japanese have invaded for several months now. Our government has consistently adopted a diplomatic approach in the spirit of peace and struggle, hoping to achieve a proper solution. However, the more we tolerate, the more rampant they become. Recently, the Japanese army attacked our garrison in Shanghai in the evening and carried out burning and killing. Although our 19th Route Army fought back head-on and inflicted heavy damage on them, the atrocities have not stopped. They have also landed in Shantou. If we do not seek to deal with them urgently, how can we be a country? We have participated in the revolution for many years and dare not lag behind. At this critical moment of life and death for the nation and the country, we have already actively prepared and will immediately take up arms and go to the front, to win glory for the nation and leave righteousness for the world. The masses are indignant and eagerly await your dispatch. Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army He Jian, Chief of Staff Liu Ying, Army Commander Liu Jianxu, Division Commander Wang Dongyuan, Peng Weiren, Li Jue, Tao Guang, Chen Guangzhong, Chen Quzhen, Zhang Ying, and all officers and soldiers bow.</p>
