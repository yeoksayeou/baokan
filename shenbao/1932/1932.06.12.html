<p>時評</p>
<h3>都市的婦女生活彬</h3>
<p>最近八十一歲的聶母在本報自由談發表「廉儉救國說」。對於奢靡的時俗。痛下針砭尤其對於所謂摩登婦婦女們的驕奢豪縱。更是深惡痛絶。文中曾有說。「貴人妻女實爲奢靡作俑之尤。且每爲男子操行事業之累。」又有說。「社會奢侈日甚一日積數十年之漏巵。遂使强鄰之船日堅。砲日利。以爲我侵略之具。是誰之過歟」聶母的持論。誠深足以激起我們的共鳴。</p>
<p>近年以來。社會生活日趨於奢靡在都市尤其有一日千里之勢。都市的婦女們。託庇於豪富或權貴的丈夫的愛憐下。其全部生活。差不多是毫無意義。毫無目的。換言之。其自身即爲無生命。無生活的活力。他們整個的生命力。都浪費於衣食。與無益的消遣。食必珍饈衣必舶來洋貨。畫眉。唇。燙髮。鑽戒高跟鞋。花樣翻新的衣着。居崇樓大厦。行汽車兜風。一切的一切。只是儘情的享受。極端的奢靡。極端的縱慾。除了衣食的享受而外。其他便是電影塲裏的陶醉。跳舞塲裏的摟抱。香檳尊前的狂歡。公圜樹蔭下的細話。麻雀撲克。鴉片以及一切足以銷靡歲月。銷磨生命活力的特事。常與都市婦女們生活結合。大部分的太太們。小姐們。少奶奶們。以至大部分的女學生們。大都是這樣的生活着。讀書只是爲了表面的裝飾。爲了便於看電影的說明書。爲了看新式衣料和裝飾品的廣告。家政不願理。兒女不願養。手足不願勞動。國難不願問聞至於世界政治經濟情勢的變遷更是與他們無涉。生活只是爲了浪費。爲了享受。爲了瘋狂的歡樂。爲了丈夫的愛憐。正如書案上的花瓶。或其他的裝飾品一樣的是爲人而存在。人呢。花瓶呢。幸福呢。恥辱呢。這種非人的生活。决不能不認爲是。一種恥辱</p>
<p>再看社會的另一面。則又有成千成萬的勞苦婦工。以至童女。爲生活而掙扎。而無盡無夜的在工廠中流出她們的血汗。在農村中的田畝中。萬千飢寒交迫的婦。爲了掙扎其一家的生活。和牛馬一樣的過度操作。她們着的是敝衣。吃的是粗食。住的是茅屋。甚至連一衣一食以至一席容身之地。亦不可得。與都市婦女們相較量。也正無異於一處天堂。一淪地獄。雖說她們的生活。是獨立的。自由的。偉大的。具有生命之活力的。然而這種勞逸苦樂不均的不平現象存。在於社會。我們也究不能不認爲是我國目前的危機。</p>
<p>如上所述的奢靡的逸樂的都市婦女。實際上大都是受過敎育。然而她們在嫁得豪富。或權勢的丈夫之後。或生在豪富之家。竟忘却了自身對國家對社會對家庭所應負的責任。而長沉湎於驕奢與逸樂。這種病態。不僅是足以危害一個家庭。抑且足以影響及其兒女兄弟姊妹。間接即所以危害社會。所以婦女們應該認清自己。應該認清自己的責任。應該從奢靡與安逸的生活裏覺悟過來。應該用自己的力量。用自己的手。爭取自己的地位。爭取自己的有意義的生活爭取自己的偉大的人格。</p>

<h3>英愛談判决裂</h3>
<p>凡勒拉返杜白林</p>
<p>路透社十日倫敦電　英愛談判進行終日、但卒成僵局、凡勒拉現已返杜白林、公報稱、所爭各點、討論頗久、但不能有何妥協云、晨間談判無功、午後續議、談判者、顯有與困難奮鬥之努力、英相麥唐納、原擬今日午後入覲英皇、以便於本星期杪、往遊巴黎與洛桑、但因欲促進英愛談判之成功、特展緩入覲之期、會議至午後五時始散、而談話良久之結果、僅爲僵局而已、南愛代表爲自由邦正副主席凡勒拉與鄂吉立、及其他二人、英代表爲包爾温、内相薩繆爾、陸相海爾珊、自治地大臣湯姆士、主席者爲英相麥唐納、討論之失敗、無足使英政界驚異、蓋早知會議無甚把握也、散會後、英相首先出塲、面有煩鬱之色、凡勒拉等旋驅車赴車站、會塲外許多愛爾蘭人士向之歡呼、湯姆士親赴站送行、湯語新聞記者云、英愛談判在沉靜中過去、彼此曾平心靜氣討論各問題云、</p>
<h3>公報中僅寥寥數語</h3>
<p>國民社十一日倫敦電　英愛會議發表簡短公報、表示已告决裂、公報僅寥寥數語、内稱、與會諸人曾將各問題詳細討論、但未見有商得協定之可能云云、按英愛會議自今晨十一時半起、至下午五時方散、中間除午餐稍休息外、諸人討論未嘗間斷、事後愛爾蘭執政凡勒拉等、即於</p>
<p>五時五十五分啟程返杜白林、愛邦執政態度、不料竟如此堅强、不肯稍變、致雙方當軸之會議、又無結果而散、然此亦並非全出意外、惟今後之發展、則殊難逆料、縱廢除宣誓問題、因愛國會否决凡勒拉提案主要點、暫時形勢稍見緩和、而地租問題、仍極緊張、恐糾紛即在目前也、</p>
<h3>出席帝國會議問題</h3>

<p>英財長</p>
<h3>發表財政意見</h3>
<p>欲解决財政困難</p>
<p>有國際合作必要</p>
<p>路透社十日倫敦電　英國財政案三讀會以四零九票對三四票通過、財相張伯倫發重要言論、謂現過之困難、爲各國所共有、斷非一國所提出之任何財政案所可解决、故有國際合作之必要、此爲可獲取現有難題解决方法之唯一途徑云、</p>
<h3>還債及調換債劵</h3>
<p>財相言及還債及調換債劵事、謂政府認爲時機適當時、即將迅速辦理云、</p>
<h3>一般的景象</h3>
<p>財相又言及一般景象、謂近有毫無根據之若干惶慮、實則過分之樂觀、與不適當之悲觀、皆非所宜、下院須持平判斷、編製預算、而以四五兩月所得稅與附稅爲根據、或根據最初兩個月之事態而作全年之預算、皆屬無益、惟渠料内地稅印花稅死稅以及所得稅與附稅之收入、似皆不致大减、渠未有確算進口稅收入之經騐、此種估算、大都出於推臆、最近進口稅收入之數字、頗使人失望、但係假期所致、此後收入當可較半云、</p>
<h3>政府信用己恢復</h3>
<p>財相繼比較現在與現政府就職前之狀况、謂政府今已達於在英人與世人心目中信用業已恢復之地位、一九二九年與一</p>
<p>九三零年失業人數之斷長增高、現已停止、三釐半債劵之市價、去年七月爲七七有奇、今已漲至八人、苟以英國地位、</p>
<p>比較他國、則英人甚有足以自慰之理由、今年一月至四月之貿易趨勢、比諸去年同期、進口貿易之貨值、英國僅减百分之一二、而美國减百分之三零、法國三五、德國三六、以言出口貿易之貨值、英國僅减百分之七、而法國减三八、美德各减三六、本年最初三個月英國之進口數量、其百分數、並未减少、而美國則减百分之四、德國一二、出口數量、德國减落尤多、計達百分之二一、美國一六、英國則所减者、不足百分之一、英國製造品之輸出數、在本年第一年中、且較去年爲多、苟非煤輸出减少、則總輸出數當有增無减云、</p>
<h3>不景氣瀰漫全球</h3>
<p>張伯倫末稱、英國雖獲全球商業之大部份、但世界商業之總數、繼續减少、足見</p>
<p>際此不景氣瀰漫全球之時、無論任何一國、無從發展、經濟不景氣之增長、已使各國人士明瞭時局之眞象矣、</p>
<h3>對洛會前途抱樂觀</h3>
<p>依渠個人觀察歐洲各國對於經濟困難之原因、及其解决辦法、目前比較戰後任何一時、似有更大同意之希望、下星期中吾人將開始會議、懇切努力、以謀在與是　　項困難有直接關係之各國間、得到同意、渠對於會議結果、頗抱樂觀、洛桑會議或將爲歐洲歷史之轉機云、</p>
<h3>智利財政條例</h3>
<p>革命政府擬加以修正</p>
<p>各國外交代表抗議之效果</p>
<p>路透社十日智利京城電　新革命政府頒佈財政條例、欲没收存於智利銀行之外幣、而照現有兌價、償以智利幣披索、因此各外國外交代表由美大使領銜、提出嚴重抗議、現悉此項抗議已有效果、聞某歐人銀行代表已報告其本國大使、謂從智利政府方面、得悉新頒條例將加修正、至少可達保障外人存欵者利益之程度云德國聲明</p>
<h3>無力再繳賠欵</h3>

<p>國民社十日柏林電　德國出席洛桑會議代表雖將奉有訓令、而今日以明白清楚之措辭、重行鄭重聲明、德國無力再繳賠欵、但據今日所聞、新政府並無否認前内閣簽字楊格計劃之効力意、德國現爲緩和法國反對計、將承認楊格計劃之合法、亦無意提出法國及其他戰勝國所索賠欵、是否有效力問題、德代表在會議中、將承認法國地位之完全合法、僅將呼籲德國無力繳付賠欵、以免引起司法問題、而受國際法庭之裁判、</p>

<p>代收新南威爾斯賦稅、以保障該邦之債務、但郎氏仍堅持不屈、即於翌日封鎖各稅所、將銀行存欵提回庫内、並派武裝隊伍、押解鐵路收入、直接歸入金庫、爭持久之、直至一月前、新南威爾斯總督（按聯邦總督與各邦總督均爲英王代表非民選）突以迅雷手叚、免郎氏政務總理之職、暫委其政敵澳州統一黨袖史蒂芬斯、代理政務總理、一反郎氏所爲、故此次選舉、設工黨獲勝、則郎氏仍將出長政府、而該邦與聯邦之爭、將見死灰復燃、如現政府之澳州統一黨獲勝、則勢足以危及聯邦之爭執、可獲切實解决云、</p>

<p>村莊裏的人聽說新先生請來了，男女老幼都跑來看，如同看新郎一樣的熱閙。我們一個一個的介紹與朱先生相見。朱先生立刻把孩子們招在一塊，說：『小朋友丨我講一個故事給你們聽吧。從前有一個農人，祗管代人種』田，把自己的田荒在那兒。後來没有米吃，就餓死了。在他死的時候忽然來了一隻鳥停在屋角上「布榖，布榖」的呌。從此鄉下人就以爲這隻布榖鳥就是那個餓死的老農變的，天天呌人「布榖」以免挨餓。這個故事你們是早已知道了。但是你們可知道這布榖鳥所呌的究竟有什麽意思呢？牠所講的話是：</p>
<p>『布榖布榖　快快布榖。　如不布榖，　没米煮粥。如要煑粥，　快快布榖。　布榖煑粥，　煑粥布榖。』</p>
<p>『我們大家念念看，要念得快，念得不錯。誰念得頂好，我就把這個小皮球交給他管。</p>
<p>大家念得高興極了。王二嫂子的小兒子櫻兒是念得頂快，一個字也没有念錯。他快樂得像個活神仙一般，就這小皮球管理之職。朱先生便開始敎小孩們拍這個奇怪而好玩的東西。這小球兒就是年長的農人也没有看過，有幾位揷進小孩子的隊伍裏去拍了一兩拍，笑嘻嘻的說：『這東西好玩！』</p>

<h3>債券甚形寥落</h3>
<p>價稍回跌趨勢呆滯</p>
<p>昨日華商證券交易所各債券期現貨市况、現貨成交稀少、全日祗開出一萬元、期市亦甚形寥落、市塲買賣人氣、始終異常冷淡、計上午交易祗六十八萬五千、後市亦僅有一百念六萬元、合計一百九十四萬五千元、内除鹽稅佔五十萬元、</p>

<h3>紐約股市一週鳥瞰</h3>
<p>美東銀公司報告</p>
<p>本週中之紐約股市、承上週杪連續上漲後、初呈反動性之回跌、乃未幾因恩俸案、與救濟失業案之通過、對於商人心理不免發生反感、蓋深恐國家預算、仍無法維持平衡、因此股市繼續下跌、已距最低紀錄不遠、幸實業股於相距半點時、己能站立至星期五、名種證券行市、始能昂然競進、奥朋汽車股、一日間再漲起二十一點餘、此種非常激進、實緣空頭抵補者之多、本週中之</p>
<p>商情、亦甚良好、鐵遭業之貨運噸額、較上週爲多、美麥形勢亦佳、因據農部統計、去年冬收爲一四、六六、○○○續、爲一九二五年以來未有之低額、汽車業生産、較上週增三千輛、惟鋼鐵業消息不佳、綜觀各方形勢、最近已有確實之進步、蓋據一般意見、紐約證券行市之跌落、衡以一般商情、實已遠過、故俟政府財政稽定後、股市必有起色也、附本週道瓊斯指數如左、</p>

<h3>紗市日在下落中</h3>
<p>棉紗市况日露襄敗之狀、以本紗底價太高、原料便宜、以致棉紗本身問題低賤、且國内社會經濟不振、農村破産、民窮財盡、於是實銷停滯、而世界物價均在狂落中、且發現空前未有之新低峯、故日商在四處售紗、進行劇烈、華北一帶被其塞滿、因之本紗大受打撃、查本紗市價與世界市况比較爲獨高、所以紗市何能維持、幸滬埠囤貨各廠未見濃厚、暫時較花市爲昂、棉之根據實需爲最大關鍵、</p>
<p>人標賣風未退人標前市開盤、以洋花回漲、塲中市况尙平、然拍至遠期趨跌、二三盤以原棉不振、各月跌五·六·七·八錢、午後市氣更弱、賣氣大盛、各月跌五·七錢、全日成交統計一萬二千三百包、查賣出穗隆八百五十包、榮興一千三百五十包、協生七百包、信誠一千二百五十包、益昶八百五十包、大昌成五百五十包、買進同餘八百包、天隆九百五十包、義成七百五十包、永大八百五十包、元泰五百包、長豐四百包、茲將收盤價分列如下、</p>

<h3>棉市江河日下</h3>
<p>棉市仍疲、跌風劇烈、大有江河日下之概、惟美棉又見微漲、本埠人氣仍虚、本應早有下落可</p>
<p>能、因底貨缺乏、多頭拉緊、現以世界狀况不景氣、本埠美國駐滬分行美安棉行在市兜攬、米特米二價二十七兩、有一萬件、尙可除去回扣一兩、此棉可製紡二十支紗原料、然申新廠鑒於世界潮流不振、皆不敢購買、由此消息傳來、市塲中大起恐慌、且有大户抛賣、市盤愈跌、惟一般棉商仍購進、加碼做多、但與外棉花比較、本棉價格程度、相差仍遠云</p>
<p>鄭標又降半兩　鄭標前市開盤、以外棉雖漲、然場中賣户仍多各月跌二三錢、午後以美棉售價極廉、信誠大量套出各月又跌三四錢、七八兩月跌破九兩關口、查全日成交統計五萬八千三百担、查賣出信誠五千四百担、裕康一千二百担、仁豐一千四百担、頥大一千二百担、永大一千四百担、餘昶一千四百坦、益昶一千担、買進源大四千五百担、長和二千八百担、愼昌二千五百担、瑞大二千担、賡豐一千一百擔、茲將收盤價分列如下、</p>

<h3>丹徒新繭裝出不暢</h3>
<p>繭價太小蠶本不敷</p>
<p>大半自烘繅絲出售</p>
<p>丹徒各市鄉、今顪農民春蠶、飼　大減、加以天時不正、蠶病叢生、傾葉不少、繭産奇歉、繭行珠鮮租出、祇當地絲廠商掛秤限繭收繭、收貨頂眞、開價又小、改喪種請最高價低二十四五元、蠶户蠶本不數、大半自烘自繅、土絲待時出售、是以乾繭輸出不暢、繭市已告終、由京滬車裝往錫滬之乾繭、統計祗五六百包云、</p>
<h3>抽芯珍眉已有動機</h3>
<p>婺東顿溪等路之抽芯珍眉、昨瑞昌杜德等行、均已動辦、惟做開市盤、一百六七十兩、較去年見低一百一二十兩、售價至爲低廉、因此華茶商、業已發出大批電報、通告停止提取此項抽芯、但普通珍眉、去胃雖略見活、然各帮人心堅軟不一、市盤仍恐有跌無漲、針眉秀眉等綠茶、昨仍隨到隨銷、珠茶亦無大宗擱滯、祁浮等路紅茶、怡和洋行、改趨觀望、其他行家、去胃不大、市面已較前大爲减色云、</p>
<h3>婺屯茶市簡報</h3>
<p>婺源茶價難下落、婺邑新茶、今歲因産額减少、山户收園時、又經號搶辦、市上布貨、僅剩三分之一未沽雖滬市銷路呆疲、棧電報惡、山户以前售價高、不願即時跌下、近日東鄉江灣·港口、開秤、價仍須八十元、邑北蕪口墾茶、由恩口茶號收買、價開六十四元、與最初市盤、無甚高下、各號睹茲後進、山價難落、滬市欠佳、爲持審愼計、多主緩辦、</p>
<p>鄣山茶採製將竣　婺北鄣山雲霧茶、因地處高崖、氣候多冷、發育較山洲平原茶見遲、每年須俟全邑新茶上市、始能開採、今歲山内天時更寒、茶芽茁發尤緩、據該山農云、本山新茶、已於旬日前開始採制、因人工充足、不日可告完峻、且喜連朝得露、茶質香味、俱比往年見優、但受滬市不振影響、曩年顧客、現尙無一家上山談盤、</p>
<p>屯溪茶價益降低　屯溪各茶號、自接上海市勢不　消息後、進茶胃量、頓見縮小、雖近日行茶來源漸旺、問津者尙屬寥寥、市價已由八十元傾跌至五十元、如滬市不回好境、各號多主製一帮完塲、免遭虧折</p>
<h3>糧食河下米市又跌一角</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日米市、裏路來源三十餘號、浦存連前約有一百三十餘號、本街交易不佳、北粳與中關米各低一角、早晚稻市消呆滯、幸貨無多、市價跟短一角、洋蘆尖貨稀胃細市况帶疲、變陰元存貨寥寥、形勢站定、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日到頭略有早市交易極淡、至午後河下斛脚頗好、薄稻開盤降低一角、常錫北粳頂定次軟、蘆埠尖及變陰元貨稀形硬、前後二市、河下解脚約三千石之譜、</p>
<h3>洋米晨跌晚定</h3>
<p>江北帮續有辦裝</p>
<p>各米續小一角許</p>
<p>昨洋米市况、晨間承連日之疲風、形勢甚萎各米一律跌小一角左右、午後天時轉陰、人心回上、江北帮與本街鄉莊等均起購買、市面疲而復定、但市上存底充實、洋行仍有兜攬、非有大帮動辦、市價甚難回漲也、統市開出小絞米三千包、價十元零四角至十元零二角半、又陳糙二百五十包、價九元一角半、茄辣地糙五百包、價九元三角七分、一號西貢一百包、價十一元六角、又江西機元米續有新到、開出一百五十包、價十三元半、除江北帮問津小絞外統爲本街鄉莊收進云、</p>
<h3>粉市在靜堅中</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各有份似轉平穏之象、以洋麥報價回漲三五角左右不等、故初開時、較前日曾回高一分零、惟至三盤後、因買氣又寂、仍人軟檔、迨至下午開盤、以大廠擯守、未有出意、兼之天時不佳、大有雨意、故交易雖稀、市氣仍頗穏健、觀察前途、必須實銷轉暢、廠粉得有出路、方有希望可言也、結果七月份較前日好一分二厘半、八月份好一分、九月份好一分二厘半十月份好一分七厘半、十一月份好一分半云、</p>
<h3>期麥疲寂如故</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各有份市面、又趨疲滯之象、洋麥雖報好三五角、惟因内地方面、新麥陸續上市、申廠有動辦、内地廠家、亦多觀察、在此情勢之下、未免消極之至、如七月份最小至三兩二錢八分、八月份三兩三錢半、可見麥市之不振矣、迨至下午開盤、初亦平平、後因粉市略有回好、人心亦爲帶起、但交易依然停寂、發展爲難耳　結果七月份較前日又小二分八月份小一分、九月份未動十月份奸一分、十一月份未動、洋麥漢口帮曾有成交、坎拿大三號麥三兩七錢半、漢口交貨、本埠廠家還價三兩六錢、尙在接洽中云、</p>
<h3>南北貨海口枝收成豐盛</h3>
<p>二週内可登新</p>
<p>海口枝去年失收、顆粒無到、乃物極必返、今賡適得豐年、據訉本屆新貨、約有七分之譜、大約半月内即可到申、因採數旣豐、成本自廉、故市價定必低賤云</p>
<h3>五金黄銅元靜極思動</h3>
<p>黄銅元市面、前因銀根緊急、各帮停辦、市象十分萎靡、售盤因此頗有下游之憂、近幾日來漢口福建諸帮均有需胃、故市情因需辦者篷勃、致有靜極思動之概、標準因此亦有扶摇直上之勢、計每擔估三十八兩云、</p>

<h3>「東方之日」詩的預言</h3>
<p>— 贍廖</p>
<p>詩經齊風「東方之日」兩章詩，小序說是剌衰之詩；我在童年時，讀這兩章詩，隨口讀過，並没有什麽感想。我現在重讀一遍，便不免驚心動魄起來！這兩章詩，好像不是二千年前剌衰之詩，郤是現代鞭策國民的座右銘！諸君不信我先把齊風的原詩寫出：</p>
<p>東方之日兮！彼姝者子，在我室兮；在我室兮，履我即兮！東方之日兮！彼姝者子，在我闥兮；在我闥兮，履我發兮！我只須略略點竄一下，彼姝的姝字，改做侏儒的侏字；履我的履字，改做管理的理字；那麽，這兩章詩便成了富有剌激性</p>
<p>的座右銘！</p>
<p>東方之日兮！彼侏者子，在我室兮；在我室兮，理我即兮！東方之日兮！彼侏者子，在我闥兮；在我闥兮，理我發兮！第一章，是說東方侏儒，已入了我們的室中！入了室中，那麽管理我們，便正即刻了！所以詩中說：『理我即兮。』</p>
<p>第二章，是說東方侏儒，已入了我們的闥中；旣已入闥，那麽管理我們便有發動的機會了，所以詩中說：『理我發兮。』</p>
<p>室在那裏？淞滬便是室，</p>
<p>闥在那裏？東三省便是闥，</p>
<p>九一八，彼侏者子入我闥，管理我們，其機已發。</p>
<p>一二八，彼侏者子入我室，管理我們，便在即刻。</p>
<p>普天下愛國靑年，每日清晨，熟讀『東方之日』詩三百徧，功德無量！</p>
<h3>詩人的房間</h3>
<p>— 鸚哥</p>
<p>丨故都雜寫之九丨</p>
<p>請原諒我，詩人的姓名我是不能告訴你，因爲他現在還活著，他還要爲他的生活一點兒事情，如果我要將他的名字寫出，那多少總影響到他的</p>
<p>生活上去；這在我是覺得不忍心，但是生活上去；這在我是覺得不忍心，但是我可以告訴你、他是有着一個很别緻的名字，給你知道了便要呌一聲怪。</p>
<p>詩人在半月前是舞着他黄色的手杖從名山來，自從在我們的院子裏的一角住下之後，我們便成天看不到詩人的臉，自然囉，他是到外面去尋他的詩了，在夜晚，人們已經睡倒在床上，狗仔是吠了，同時我們的詩人是回來了，除了他那「咯咯」的皮鞋聲很清晰地打進你的腦子，便祗聽得詩人漫長了嗓子在哼着詩句兒。自然，這是詩人化一天工夫找來的僅有的絶句了。</p>
<p>詩人的頭髮很長，黑壓壓地披到肩頭。面色呢？不用說也是很蒼白的，你見着時，也許會覺得他是一個活鬼。而他的房間呢？也就與衆不同的。一天，老媽子替詩人的房間拖地板，她認眞地呌：「周爺！你來瞧。」一時，我被她喊着也就好奇地跑了過去。果然，我們詩人的房間是不失我們所望。且看丨房裏的地板掘去兩大塊，種着兩株夾竹桃，夾竹桃在房裏受不到雨露是枯萎了；是的，枯萎了才有詩意。房間裏没有桌子也没有坐椅，絶無僅存的傢具是一張矮而長的板床，這就是每夜負托我詩人的軀體的東西。地板上滿堆着書和紙，老媽子幾次要把這搬出去，都被詩人阻止了。我順手就從地上揀起了一本雪來詩選，打開一看，我怎麽也看不下去！原來這些寳貴的詩篇上已做了臭蟲的跳舞塲了。再看粉白的牆上，滿壁琳琅地寫着詩人的傑作，最使我感動的是那「我和瑪莉，兩人遊獻。」的兩句了。老媽子問我！「這位先生到底做點什么來？」我便很忠實地告訴好；「他是一個詩人」。「屍人」？老媽子就不明白了。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>愛用香水和肥皂一類的化妝品的。不但是女性男性中也有不少愛好的人。即如前英國國王喬治四世。每年消耗在化妝品上的費用。須七百金鎊。若以現在的市價合算。足有二千金鎊之巨。</p>
<p>美國梅思州Maine地方。有希爾Hill氏一家。子息都是七數。這位希爾先生的父親。是七子之一。而也生了七個兒子。希望先生就是這其中的一個。自娶妻後。竟也陸續的生了七個兒子。長子早已成家、竟一樣的有了七個兒子了。</p>
<p>英國全國的男女和兒童。都愛糖食。據最近一年的統計。竟達七萬五千萬磅之多。若以人口作比例。平均每人每年共吃十七磅。▲倫敦商店中很有幾家老前輩。其在一百年以前的。計有六百五十家。還有好幾家更是古老。都已有了數百年的歷史。</p>
<h3>異味</h3>
<p>— 楊一笑</p>
<p>淮安蒲菜和鱔魚。四季均有。蒲菜爲淮安勺湖産。蓮花街業此者。櫛比鱗次。味最鮮嫰。葷素適宜。鰭魚産稱田間。淮廚别有烹法。爲普通所不及。聞淮廚能以鐥魚製全席。形式風味。各有不同。所謂蒲菜鱔魚。獨步江淮焉。</p>
<p>濟南菜有雨前蝦仁。味極佳。法以生蝦肉一碗。另用鷄蛋一枚。去黄用白。打極透。將雨前茶葉一撮。和蝦仁拌匀。以能個個分離爲適度。略入鹽少許。起猪油鑊。乘油沸時。將蝦仁用漏匀盛之。入鑊炒二三炒即起。則茶葉已放。清香甘美。頗饒風味。</p>
<h3>吳下雜記</h3>
<p>— 殺</p>
<p>金閶花事。久著艶譽。雖靑白易幟時。曾受一度打撃。顧曾幾何時。彼人問哀鴻。又復充斥旅邸間。惟際百業凋敝之時。花間生涯。亦大悽清。第今則時勢造英雄。此種路柳牆花。類皆得趁東風。飛上别枝。十萬金鈴。護作太太以去。即有存者。亦皆價格陡增。非復曩日之待沽無人矣。</p>
<p>十九路軍之抗日。爲我中華民國生死存亡之關鍵。凡屬中華國民。理宜敵愾同仇。一致援助。以爭國家之存亡。顧當十九路軍喋血淞滬時。我吳後方服務團中。所收國民援助前方將士之資。以三十萬居民之吳郡。僅及六千餘金。而避難他遷。遭湖匪刦掠而損失者反常在萬金以上。我民之缺乏國家觀念。而富室之祗顧自保其家。實足令有心人痛哭流涕。而嘆</p>
<h3>廉儉救國說（八）</h3>
<p>— 聶曾紀芬述男其杰撰文</p>
<p>近人好逞己見。淆亂是非。多數人以耳爲目。不能抉擇。於是薄禮敎。毁聖言。自鳴得意。遂造成今日貧亂危急之現象。孰知世界一切糾紛情形。皆嘗經古哲所親歷而加以研討。從其事效。發爲精確之結論。循而行之。則舉凡經濟難題。階級爭端。悉得解决。準諸最新社會主義之學說。多能適合。且世界愈演進而後愈見其允當焉。然非此文範圍所及。故不詳論。予惟欲以個人身受之先訓。貢獻於當世有指導社會之責者。冀加以嚴重之考慮。若有多數聞人。以身作則。挽回風氣。勿輕國俗而重歐風。實行大禹及古來興國名賢之所爲。惡衣服菲飲食。卑宮室。提倡撲拙粗陋之國貨。而羣以用華貴精美便利之舶來品爲可恥。二轉移間。成效可立覩也。然近今社會。女子左右風尙之力。較男子允大。其責任亦更重。故吾尤望我女界能先見及此。妻勵其夫。母勉其子。姊妹勸其兄弟。咸犧牲個人之欲望。羣策羣力。以廉救國。以儉拯民。以不欺安羣而和衆。期以五年。國防固矣。夫國防者。非堅城深溝利兵而已也。管子曰、禮義廉恥。國之四維。四維不張。國乃滅亡。孟子所謂城高池深兵堅甲利委而去之者。四維不張故也。先文公曰。無兵不爲深憂。無餉不足痛哭。獨舉目斯世。求一攘利不先。赴義恐後。忠憤耿耿者。不可亟得。斯其可足浩歎者也。</p>
<p>國亡之無日也。</p>
<p>淞滬抗日陣亡將士追悼大會。旣於吳下舉行。當代偉人。連翩蒞止。會塲秩序。由六十師士兵及海上童子軍維持。警備森嚴。公園及公共體育塲四周。咸成特别戒嚴區域。凡非軍警。及佩有來賓通行證者。率難駐足參觀。當偉人入會塲時。由會中雇馬車迎送入城。一時五卅路上。車馬櫛比。頓成異觀。曩日江都李涵秋氏。草「廣陵潮」說部。有馬車入城至元妙觀一節。閱者譏其不諳吳下狀况。今則李氏預言。竟成事實。泉下有知。其亦自詡爲先知歟。</p>
<p>淞滬抗日陣亡將士追悼大會。所收各處送來輓聯祭品。多如山積。其中以東北將士所送臘製花圈。鮮艶動目。某師全體將士贈與之奪獲暴日之步槍兩枝。炸彈一枚。所製花屏。最爲别緻。開會之日。會塲及公園四周。輓聯周懸。滿目縞素。其中盡多可歌可泣之詞。此日哀榮。或可稍慰陣亡將士英魂。然東北淪陷。遼吉未復。恢復河山。尙有待乎未死將士。循先烈之血路而推進也。</p>
<h3>戰後的曁大</h3>
<p>— 徐本熙</p>
<p>在戰區被毁的大學裏，眞如曁大還算是最幸運的一個，雖科學館炸去了一部份</p>
<p>聽說内部什物，已被漢奸沈頌閣般運一空，而敵軍臨去時，不免又埋了些危險物，爲防制危險起見，一概不准入内，須待專家視察然後開放。入内不得，只從樹隙裏遥矚含有詩意的蓮韜館，便知道它是怎樣的憔悴而懊喪？無疑的，昔日風流，都歸流水了。</p>
<p>重至二百五十磅的炸彈，炸不着蔡將軍，也炸不着高峨的洋樓，只幾間不炸也要倒的小屋，坍成廢墟了。</p>
<p>三節運貨車，却也炸得體無完膚，至今停留在鐵軌上。從事實的報告中，我們知道有十六個忠勇衛國的軍士，和七匹戰馬，就喪失性命於這幾輛貨車裏。至今，至今，望着曁大發怔，只不見這些屍體，</p>
<h3>戎馬雙棲記（七六）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第九回　附專車逐客有虚驚　坐冷衙化石成遐想</p>
<p>安玉田見著小毛。猶如患難中見著了一個親人。自是喜出望外。但一問到昨晚的事。又依然一肚子没好氣。就悻悻答道。别提啦。那姓郭的做事没有跟。竟把我送到衛隊車上。受了一夜的罪。說著。旋又想起所受的那些侮辱。如全行說出未免忒丢人。就忙咽住不再詳提。祗改口問太太們現在那裏。毛德順道。唉。誰曉得那小荒唐鬼圖省事。把你送到那種地方去了呢。那一節車隔了有七八節。難怪我找不著的。現在五太太已經回了衙門。你太太不放心。還在候車室候著。等你一同往第一賓館搬。我們在車上已拍出電報定好了房間了。說罷。忙拉了他上頭等候車室去。梁笑雲乍見他一夜工夫竟精神頽喪得這種樣子。少不得還要細細追問。他迭連摇頭嘆氣。祗推托到了旅館再說不遲。及毛德順把他們送到第一賓館。告辭去後。他才將經過情形細向梁笑雲說知。並還埋怨伊爲什麽不在上車時就派人向各處找他、梁笑雲嘖嘖聲祗笑道。好意思的。堂堂男子漢。同太太出門。行李</p>
<p>和當差的。全由我替你照料帶到。你一點也不管。還要埋怨我不管你。難道你還是三歲兩歲。要我把你抱在手上才行嗎。上一回當。學一回乖。祗怪你閱歷太淺。糊</p>
<p>裏糊塗就跟人家跑。也不回轉來先告訴我一聲。才閙這大笑話。我勸你以後遇事還是與我商量過才做。别再這樣莽撞。這官塲中你不清楚的事還很多呢。安玉田受了這番敎訓。也自覺是咎由自取。不再多言。郤不想在這旅館裏一住下來。當晚又接得毛德順的電話。說葉督軍又啓節向别處檢閱軍隊去了。三五天才能回來。呌他們好好候著。從此安玉田固然是靜候。梁笑雲郤每天總被五太太打電話或派人來。接到衙門去玩、撇下安玉田白天一人在旅館裏甚感寂寞。到第六天裏。梁笑雲竟在衙門中打了一夜的牌没回。安玉田聽見旅館人人傳說葉督軍郤回來了。</p>

<h3>談談家事</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>大家庭制度，早已彰明較著的不適用於現代潮流，則小家庭制度，自應應運而産生，</p>
<p>「五世同堂」「八代不分家」，名目雖然好聽，但是一考究其内容，阿嫂與姑娘不和，大媽與阿嬸反對，即兄弟之間，亦未必能一團和氣，你說我浪費得多，我說你居住得好，内部的爭執，必定非常厲害，不過爲舊禮敎所束握，家長的挾持，亦只得無可奈何，</p>
<p>現在「五世同堂」「八代不分家」的名目，旣不足以資號召，并不能算爲美談了，即家長的權威，亦不能統治其家庭的全部，「同室操戈」「兄弟鬩牆」，阿弟不認阿兄，大媽欺凌阿嬸，一家之内，詬誶時聞，「籬笆旣破，野狗來鑽」，土匪流氓，乘問而入，一家好好人家，弄得不成樣子，</p>
<p>若照現在情形看來，還是組織小家庭，較爲適宜，訂立「各人自掃門前雪，不管他家屋上霜」的條約，各立門户，各自生産，各人自去奮鬭，或者家庭倒有小康的一日，</p>
<p>若再要掙扎「五世同堂」「八世不分家」的空塲面，我恐這人家，一定要全軍覆没呢，</p>

<h3>怎樣裝置避雷針</h3>
<p>— 允釐</p>
<p>諸位讀者們！在上次那篇雷是什麽的文章内，已經告訴了你們空中兩種陰陽不同的電相接觸的時候，不但發出爆炸的聲音，並且可以炸害地面上的人畜和屋宇。照這樣看來，這種電眞是危險極了。但是，我們可有甚麽方法來避免呢？</p>
<p>西曆一七五二年，就是在一百七十八年前，美國那位著名的科學家弗蘭克林（Franklin）用風筆實騐空中有電後，便發明了避雷針（Lightning）（Conductor）</p>
<p>，用來保護屋宇和屋内的人畜，所以現在一般高大的房屋，都有這種避雷針的裝置了。</p>
<p>避雷針是個金屬棒（註）。牠的裝法：就是把這金屬棒安在屋頂最高的地方。金屬的上端是尖銳的，下端聯一根金屬線；金屬線的下端聯有幾塊金屬板。再把這些金屬板埋在地下最潮濕的地方。因爲地下感潮濕，便愈容易傳電。</p>
<p>屋頂上裝了避雷針，何以就能夠免去電的危險呢？但是，我們要明瞭；一切的物質裏都含有電，這金屬棒裏也自然含有電。平常所以不感覺有電，是因爲陰陽兩種電量是平均的，是互相調和的，這就是電學家之所謂「中和」。</p>
<p>若雷雨大作，雲中的電之所以爲害多。因爲陰陽兩種電量不平均，那過多的電便要吸引所缺乏的異性雷，就是說：陽電過多便要吸引陰電，陰電過多便要吸陽電，所以就發生雷電的危險。</p>
<p>我們要免去這種電的危險，祇須用避雷針來消滅那過多的陽雷或過多的陰電。因爲針的上端是尖銳的，是容易放電的。當雲帶了過量的陰電來到避雷針的附近時，因用感應作用，針上所含的陽電便由針的尖端放出，和雲中的中和而使之消滅；針上留下來一部分的陰電，便由金屬線傳入地下。若雲所帶來的是陽電，那避雷針便放出陰電來與之中和；所留下來一部分的陽電便由金屬線傳入地下。總之，無論帶陽雷來也吧，帶陰電來也吧，牠總是放出異性的電來與之中和，所以能夠免去雷電的危險。</p>
<p>避雷針的下面，爲什麽要用根金屬線聯些金屬片埋在最潮濕的地下呢？這是因爲在大雷雨時，雲帶陰電來到針的附近，針上的陽電由針的尖端放出，便留下過量陰電；若雲帶陽帶來到針的附近，針上的陰電由針的尖端放出，便留下過量的陽電。像這樣留下的過量陰電</p>
<p>或是陽電，必須由金屬線寫入地下，才可以完全免去危險。所以那些金屬片必須埋在最潮濕的地下。假若要埋在乾燥的地下，避雷針便失其效用。因爲乾燥的土地，不是良導體，不容易傳雷。</p>
<p>避雷針除了上面所述的一種裝置外，還有一種裝法。。就是把金屬線作成網狀，罩在屋的上方，以免雷電的災害，但無論如何，必得要用一根金屬線聯幾塊金屬板通到地下。</p>
<p>（註）金銀銅鐵錫···這一類的物質，都稱爲金屬。做避雷針，最好用紅銅。</p>

<h3>（五）××公司巡禮</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>長針正指在十一點上，離散寫字間還欠五分，蕭文英的心怦怦的跳動？他想起剛才袁進之的賭學入門，比坐寫字間的死薪水爽快得多，他把寫字檯上的東西整理一下，預備那時鐘鏜鏜的搞了。</p>
<p>兩個人並行的往××公司進行，袁進之像没有事般的談着女子的故事，蕭文英雖然急於要明瞭××公司的情形，但是没有他揷話的餘地，祗聽見他忽然輕輕地說「到了」正是時常走過的×××路口，幾個穿黑長衫的特殊人物，永遠閒散的坐在門口。</p>
<p>他低着頭隨進之走過一條長的甬道，就聽見噪雜的聲音從每一堆的人羣中發出來，他很想擠進去看看是何等摸樣，誰料進之已踏上對甬道的樓梯，毫無經騐的他，也惟有追隨着識途老馬更上一層樓了。</p>
<p>樓上和樓下絶然不同，像進了女兒國一樣，許多每天和化裝品店生意往來的上海婦女，迷着她們的媚眼，望盤裏的球子滾進自己押餅子的號碼上，雖然像香檳票一般，有一個號碼佔最後之勝利，但是不少失望的表情，先寒了蕭文英進來時的一股熱力。</p>
<p>袁進之買了三十塊錢的碼子，如每天進公司管理簿記，在阿拉伯字碼上與命運交戰，文英握着袋裏的鈔票始終躊躇没有勇氣拿出來，自以爲有著作賭學第門的進之，三十塊錢在鈴······鈴鐘聲中滾進廣東銀行（大概談談賭經的大老官，都知道廣東銀行的典故）他的額上像跑進飲氷室的顧客一樣，似乎赴西砲臺般慢慢走出來，並是忘了還有個靠他作識途老馬的蕭文英在背後。</p>
<p>一前一後的從公司出來，各人懷着不同的情緒，在黑影中消逝。</p>

<h3>少年與呌化</h3>
<p>— 隠</p>
<p>一條行人稀少的馬路上，只有一兩個齷齪不堪衣衫襤褸的呌化子，坐在人家屋簷下，找尋他身上小麥大的蝨子，接二連三的只望嘴裏送，掁他那種神氣，比較摩登男女在一塊兒吃西菜的興趣，還要勝幾倍，</p>
<p>遠遠的傳來一種咯咯咯的皮鞋聲，漸漸的由遠而近，那個呌化子立刻停止了捉蝨的工作，站了起來，迎到那位穿皮鞋的少年身邊，</p>
<p>「好先生加福加壽，做做好事丨」他很懇切的說，</p>
<p>「·······」那少年仍是旁若無人的走着，</p>
<p>「唉先生我兩天没有吃子，做做好事吧」他哭喪着臉，顯出很可憐的樣子說，</p>
<p>「······」少年頭也不回揚長的去了，</p>
<p>咯咯咯的皮鞋聲又漸漸的由近而遠了，可憐的呌化子，直等到看不見他的影子，才很失望的踱回他原坐的地方，去做他的捉蝨工作了，</p>
<p>明日我又看見那穿皮鞋的少年，在××公園跟着一個學生派的美貌女郎的背後，這大概就是上海人所謂跟梢吧，</p>
<p>「Miss尊姓，貴校何名，我們做個朋友可好」他很懇切的問好，</p>
<p>「······」她仍是旁若無人的走着，「唉Miss現在社交公開，男女平等，做做朋友也不要緊呀，何必不睬我呢，······」他很急切的說，</p>
<p>「······」她頭也不回的走出公園門去了，</p>
<p>他立在門口，看着她的背影，遠遠的去了，才倒抽一口氣，很失望的走進公園，依　　做那黄包車的玩意兒·</p>
<p>麵色問題</p>
<h3>生活素描</h3>
<p>— 雲織</p>
<p>「太太，你買了罷，一總只有十二斤，譬如做好事，」一位衣衫襤褸的鄉下老婆婆這樣的說，</p>
<p>「你賣蠶豆，我有銅錢你有貨，爲什麽你要說這樣可憐的話呢？」一位鄉下有錢的太太這樣懷疑着問，</p>
<p>「不是的，太太，你買了，我還要趕緊去另挑一担出來再賣呢丨」</p>
<p>「爲什麽這樣情急呀？」</p>
<p>「爲的明天至少要有三塊錢急用，現在還没有一個錢在手呢，」</p>
<p>「三塊錢做什麽急用？」</p>
<p>「因爲明天請了六位相帮的在家種番薯，至少要有三塊錢，二萬番薯種的價錢還是欠着呀，」</p>
<p>「你不是家裏還有人麽？」</p>
<p>「唉、不用說起、一個兒子養到十八歲，挑一担鹽到鎭上去賣，因爲老子生病了，那知給捉私鹽的拿了去，非但將鹽充公，還受了一頓打，氣不過見子生病死了，娶的一房媳婦，從此娘家來領回去，如今只剩下我們兩個老骨頭，六十多的夫婦，偏又不肯死，活着不能不吃飯呀，」言時老婆的眼圈紅了，</p>
<p>「你現在種多少田纔好老夫婦倆吃飯呢？」太太這樣可憐的問，　　「兒子在的時候一共種租田十六畝，現在不能不退給人家種，自己只種十畝了，去了六塊錢一畝的租費，這年頭眞是活不過，」言着這老婆婆的眼圈又紅了，</p>
<p>「好罷，那麽你就將這蠶豆一總賣給我們罷，諾，錢在這裏，」</p>
<p>「好的，眞正阿彌陀佛，」</p>
<p>「呀，我說話太多了，我還急着忙趕回家呢，」這老婆婆說着匆匆的拿了錢走了，（却酬）</p>

<p>孽緣</p>
<h3>心有餘而力不足慕賢小姐</h3>
<p>是否有了今日男女自由擇配，因而覺着舊式婚姻的痛苦，還是舊式婚姻素來是痛苦的，這個重大的問題，痛苦的，這個重大的問題，像我一個十七歲的女孩子，終不能解决，</p>
<p>我的好同學，住在我近鄰，同我同年生的憶夢，好在，這個月底要出嫁了，她自從十日前曉得自己的嫁期後，哭哭啼啼，日以眼涙洗面，二個眼泡早像胡桃一樣，她並不是因年紀輕，輒然離開好的慈愛父母的懷抱，送到人地生疏的夫家去爲憂，也並不在家養尊處優慣了，給了一個窮措大的丈夫，完全不是，</p>
<p>她唯一的原因，無非父母爲她强行擇配，遂使她絶對的不滿意是了，</p>
<p>她的夫家是可算得一個畸形的家庭，七拚八凑成功的，除她的翁外，她的婆是姘識的，好未來的丈夫是個螟蛉子，她的翁還有一個秘密在外結婚的小老婆，現收在家裏，也已生有子女了，並且她婆還有前夫生的一個女兒，雖已字人、因爲女婿不事生産，仍依岳家爲命，</p>
<p>憶夢年紀輕的時候，她的翁還是一個肩販，他住在好家附近的矮屋裏，因爲他財運亨通，一天發達一天，到現在有了點家産，憶夢的父親，看他有了錢，把女兒給了他做媳婦，那時她年紀小，一點不懂，到了近來三四年中，何日不在反對這段婚姻，向父母提出不滿意不在反對這段婚姻，向父母提出不滿意，痛哭流涕，不知有了好幾次，用盡了她的方法，有時會向她父母哀求，有時用大義去感動他的父母，終是使她失望，不得到結果，最近的一次，她拿自己的性命去恐嚇他們，不但得不着父母的愛憐，反用暴力壓制她，</p>
<p>這次她的婚期怎樣迫促，據我曉得，她的婆病得很沉重，醫生都朿手，急要把媳婦娶進來，預備她死後，爲她穿素帶孝，</p>
<p>我親愛的憶夢，我實在心有餘而力不足，我怎能夠帮你的忙呢，</p>

<h3>Urban Women's Life</h3>
<p>Recently, 81-year-old Mother Nie published "On National Salvation Through Thrift and Frugality" in the "Free Forum" section of this newspaper. She fiercely criticized the extravagant customs of the time, especially the vanity and profligacy of so-called modern women. In the article, she stated, "The wives and daughters of dignitaries are the worst instigators of extravagance and often burden their husbands' conduct and careers." She also said, "Social extravagance increases day by day, and the accumulation of decades of leakage allows the enemy's ships to become stronger and their cannons sharper, providing them with the means to invade us. Whose fault is this?" Mother Nie's arguments are indeed deeply resonant and can stir our common concern.</p>
<p>In recent years, social life has become increasingly extravagant, especially in cities, where the trend is advancing rapidly. Urban women, sheltered by the affection of their wealthy or powerful husbands, lead lives that are almost meaningless and aimless. In other words, they themselves are devoid of life and vitality. Their entire life force is wasted on clothing, food, and useless entertainment. Their diet consists of delicacies, and their clothes are imported foreign goods. They paint their eyebrows and lips, perm their hair, wear diamond rings and high heels, and constantly change their clothing styles. They live in tall buildings, drive around in cars, and everything is about unrestrained enjoyment, extreme extravagance, and extreme indulgence. Besides the enjoyment of food and clothing, they indulge in the intoxication of the cinema, the embraces of the dance hall, the revelry before champagne, the sweet nothings whispered under the shade of trees in the park, mahjong, poker, opium, and all other things that consume time and wear down life's vitality. These things are often associated with the lives of urban women. Most wives, young ladies, young mistresses, and even most female students live this way. They read only for superficial decoration, to understand movie subtitles, or to see advertisements for new fabrics and decorations. They are unwilling to manage household affairs, unwilling to raise children, unwilling to do manual labor, and unwilling to inquire about national affairs. As for changes in the world's political and economic situation, they are even more irrelevant to them. Their lives are only for waste, for enjoyment, for wild joy, and for their husbands' affection. They are like vases or other decorations on a desk, existing for the sake of others. What about people? What about vases? What about happiness? What about shame? This inhuman life cannot but be considered a disgrace.</p>
<p>Looking at the other side of society, there are tens of thousands of working women, even young girls, struggling to make a living, endlessly pouring out their blood and sweat in factories day and night. In the fields of rural areas, countless hungry and cold women are working excessively, like cattle and horses, to support their families. They wear tattered clothes, eat coarse food, and live in thatched huts. They cannot even obtain the bare necessities of clothing, food, or a place to sleep. Compared to urban women, it is like comparing heaven and hell. Although it is said that their lives are independent, free, great, and full of vitality, the existence of such unequal phenomena of labor and leisure, hardship and happiness in society cannot but be considered a crisis in our country.</p>
<p>The extravagant and leisurely urban women described above are mostly educated. However, after marrying wealthy or powerful husbands, or being born into wealthy families, they forget their responsibilities to the country, society, and family, and become immersed in vanity and pleasure. This pathological state is not only sufficient to harm a family, but also to affect their children, siblings, and indirectly harm society. Therefore, women should recognize themselves, recognize their responsibilities, and awaken from their extravagant and comfortable lives. They should use their own strength and their own hands to fight for their position, fight for their meaningful life, and fight for their great personality.</p>

Ma is in Hailun and will go to the front lines within days to supervise the attack on Harbin.

The Japanese Consulate General in Fengtian believes that maintaining the status quo will inevitably lead to many complicated matters between the State of Manchuria and Japan and also advocates for rapid recognition at this time. They have submitted this idea to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Recently, Japanese residents in Manchuria have been demanding that the authorities not be bound by international relations and promptly grant recognition, and the momentum is particularly fierce.

They are currently negotiating a loan contract with the British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees, and it can be signed in a few days.

Another loan of about 100,000 yuan will be used to purchase land and build factory buildings. The remaining amount will be raised and supplemented by the Ministry of Industry. The method of guaranteeing interest is that the Ministry of Finance will guarantee the mineral tax for the first three years, and then the factory will pay it itself. After the contract is signed, specialists will be sent to the United Kingdom to negotiate the purchase of machinery. At the same time, the construction of factory buildings will begin and is scheduled to be completed within six months. Manufacturing can begin at the end of this year or next spring.

<p>A Returnee from Chita Talks About</p>
<h3>The Situation of Overseas Chinese in Russia</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Informally released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a conversation with a returnee from Chita,</p>
<p>There are still more than 50,000 overseas Chinese scattered in Siberia. Due to the severe climate, they work for half a year and stay idle for half a year. However, farmers and peddlers are more profitable. Peddlers are divided into two types: general merchandise stores and mobile vendors. Every autumn, they bid to the government for contracts. If there are excess profits, they will be distributed among three to five people the following year so that one person does not monopolize them. Most of the overseas Chinese who engage in agriculture marry Russian women, and their taxes are light and their profits are high. Handicrafts such as bootmakers, carpenters, laundry workers, etc. have very high monthly incomes. Those who fill hard labor to cut grass and logging have enough to eat and clothe themselves every day. The diligent and thrifty still have savings. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Irish Negotiations Break Down</h3>
<p>De Valera Returns to Dublin</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th. Anglo-Irish negotiations continued all day but ended in a stalemate. De Valera has now returned to Dublin. A communique stated that the points of contention were discussed at length but no compromise could be reached. Morning negotiations were unsuccessful. Discussions continued in the afternoon. Negotiators clearly struggled with difficulties. British Prime Minister MacDonald originally planned to meet the King this afternoon in order to travel to Paris and Lausanne at the end of the week, but postponed the meeting to promote the success of the Anglo-Irish negotiations. The meeting adjourned at 5 pm, and after lengthy discussions, the result was only a stalemate. The South Irish representatives were Free State President and Vice President De Valera and O'Higgins, and two others. The British representatives were Baldwin, Home Secretary Samuel, Secretary of War Hailsham, and Dominion Secretary Thomas. The meeting was chaired by British Prime Minister MacDonald. The failure of the discussion is not surprising to British political circles, as it was known early on that the meeting had little chance of success. After the meeting, the British Prime Minister was the first to leave the scene, looking troubled. De Valera and others then drove to the station. Many Irish people outside the venue cheered them. Thomas went to the station to see them off. Thomas told reporters that the Anglo-Irish negotiations had passed quietly, and both sides had calmly discussed the issues.</p>
<h3>The Communique Contains Only a Few Words</h3>
<p>National Press Agency, London, 11th. The Anglo-Irish Conference issued a brief communique, indicating that it had broken down. The communique contained only a few words, stating that the participants had discussed the various issues in detail but saw no possibility of reaching an agreement. The Anglo-Irish Conference started at 11:30 this morning and adjourned at 5 pm. Except for a short break for lunch, the participants discussed without interruption. Afterwards, Irish leader De Valera and others departed for Dublin at 5:55 pm. The attitude of the Irish leader was unexpectedly so firm that he refused to change his position slightly, resulting in the failure of the meeting between the authorities of both sides. However, this was not entirely unexpected. However, future developments are difficult to predict. Even if the issue of abolishing the oath is temporarily eased due to the Dail's rejection of De Valera's main proposal, the land rent issue is still extremely tense, and conflicts may be imminent.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Attending the Imperial Conference</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 10th. Tonight, people familiar with the Irish issue said that the failed Anglo-Irish negotiations mainly discussed the issue of Ireland attending the Ottawa Imperial Conference. This negotiation is very meaningful because Dominion Secretary Thomas had previously declared in the House of Commons that the preliminary negotiations on canceling the oath and participating in the Imperial Conference are incompatible. Thomas's declaration attracted much attention. The failure of the Anglo-Irish representatives to negotiate in London was nothing more than seeking to reconcile these two matters. Last night, Londoners thought that Ireland's attendance at the Ottawa Conference in July was unlikely. The invitation to the conference was indeed sent from Canada, but in the future, the British position in the Imperial Conference will be superior, and its power of decision cannot be ignored. What is unknown is whether Britain will exercise this power of decision.</p>

<p>Den'no, Tokyo, 11th. In addition to establishing a debt consolidation association as a method of rural relief, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has also decided to provide an average of 30 yen per household, totaling 150 million yen, in low-interest financing for production capital.</p>
<h3>Method for Consolidating the Debts of Poor Farmers</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th. Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto summoned Vice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Ishiguro yesterday afternoon to discuss the emergency relief measures that the administrative authorities should take for rural areas. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry unanimously advocated the consolidation of debts of 6 billion yen, intending to apply it to the middle class who can obtain low-interest funds from the Hypothec Bank of Japan and the Industrial Bank of Japan. At the same time, it will focus on the consolidation of unsecured items, such as debts between individuals, with a total debt of 3 billion yen for the poor. The consolidation method is to organize a debt consolidation association by village. The Deposit Bureau of the Ministry of Finance will provide low-interest funds so that the profits from the joint sales association, which is one and the same with the debt consolidation association, can be used to repay the debts.</p>
<p>Passed by the US Senate</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Relief Bill</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 10th. The Senate has passed a relief bill initiated by the Democratic Party, authorizing the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to prepare 300 million US dollars to lend to various states to relieve industry and commerce, and to raise 200 million US dollars to start production projects and support agriculture. The bill has now been returned to the House of Representatives for review. President Hoover does not approve of this bill.</p>
<p>British Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>
<h3>Expresses Fiscal Views</h3>
<p>To Solve Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>International Cooperation is Necessary</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th. The British Finance Bill passed its third reading by a vote of 409 to 34. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain made an important statement, saying that the current difficulties are shared by all countries and cannot be resolved by any fiscal bill proposed by one country. Therefore, international cooperation is necessary. This is the only way to obtain a solution to the current problems.</p>
<h3>Debt Repayment and Bond Exchange</h3>
<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned debt repayment and bond exchange, saying that the government believes that when the time is right, it will proceed quickly.</p>
<h3>General Picture</h3>
<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer also spoke about the general picture, saying that there has recently been some unwarranted anxiety. In fact, excessive optimism and inappropriate pessimism are both undesirable. The House of Commons must judge fairly and prepare a budget. Basing it on the income tax and surtax revenue for April and May, or basing a full-year budget on the situation in the first two months, is useless. However, he expects that the revenue from inland taxes, stamp duties, death duties, and income tax and surtax will not decrease significantly. He does not have experience in accurately calculating import tax revenue. This kind of estimate is mostly based on conjecture. The recent figures for import tax revenue have been disappointing, but this is due to the holidays. The revenue should be better after that.</p>
<h3>Government Credit Restored</h3>
<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer then compared the current situation with the situation before the current government took office, saying that the government has now reached a point where its credit has been restored in the eyes of the British people and the world. The sharp increase in unemployment in 1929 and 1930 has stopped. The market price of 3.5% bonds was just over 77 last July and has now risen to 88. Comparing the British position with other countries, the British have much to be proud of. From January to April this year, the trend of trade compared to the same period last year shows that the value of import trade in Britain decreased by only 1.2%, while the United States decreased by 30%, France by 35%, and Germany by 36%. In terms of the value of export trade, Britain decreased by only 7%, while France decreased by 38%, and the United States and Germany each decreased by 36%. In the first three months of this year, the quantity of British imports did not decrease as a percentage, while the United States decreased by 4% and Germany by 12%. The quantity of exports decreased even more in Germany, reaching 21%, the United States 16%, and Britain decreased by less than 1%. The number of British manufactured goods exported in the first year of this year was even more than last year. If coal exports had not decreased, the total exports would have increased without decrease.</p>
<h3>Recession Spreads Globally</h3>
<p>Chamberlain concluded by saying that although Britain has obtained a large part of global commerce, the total amount of world commerce continues to decrease, indicating that at a time when this recession is spreading globally, no country can develop. The increase in the economic recession has made people in all countries understand the true nature of the situation.</p>
<h3>Optimistic About the Prospects of the Lausanne Conference</h3>
<p>In his personal observation of the causes of the economic difficulties in European countries and their solutions, there seems to be greater hope for agreement than at any time after the war. We will begin a meeting next week and make earnest efforts to reach an agreement among the countries that are directly related to these difficulties. He is quite optimistic about the outcome of the meeting, and the Lausanne Conference may be a turning point in European history.</p>
<h3>Chilean Financial Regulations</h3>
<p>Revolutionary Government Plans to Amend Them</p>
<p>The Effect of Protests by Foreign Diplomatic Representatives</p>
<p>Reuters, Santiago, Chile, 10th. The new revolutionary government promulgated financial regulations, intending to confiscate foreign currencies deposited in Chilean banks and repay them with Chilean pesos at the current exchange rate. Therefore, foreign diplomatic representatives, led by the US Ambassador, lodged a serious protest. It is now learned that this protest has had an effect. It is reported that a representative of a certain European bank has reported to his country's ambassador that he has learned from the Chilean government that the newly promulgated regulations will be amended, at least to the extent of protecting the interests of foreign depositors. German Statement</p>
<h3>Unable to Pay Reparations Anymore</h3>
<p>But Does Not Deny the Validity of the Young Plan</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Berlin, 10th. Although the German representatives attending the Lausanne Conference will have instructions, they today solemnly reiterated in clear terms that Germany is unable to pay reparations anymore. However, according to what was heard today, the new government does not deny the validity of the Young Plan signed by the previous cabinet. Germany now intends to recognize the legality of the Young Plan to appease French opposition and has no intention of raising the issue of whether the reparations claimed by France and other victorious countries are valid. The German representatives will acknowledge the complete legality of France's position in the conference and will only appeal that Germany is unable to pay the reparations to avoid causing judicial problems and being subject to the judgment of the International Court.</p>
<h3>Uchida Yasuya Becomes Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Appointment Ceremony to be Held Tomorrow</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th. Uchida Mitsugu, president of the South Manchuria Railway, will arrive in Tokyo on the morning of the 12th. It is rumored that Prime Minister Saito will persuade Count Uchida to take the post of Foreign Minister. As a result, Count Uchida will definitely agree, and the appointment ceremony may be held on the 14th or 15th. As for the selection of a successor to the president of the South Manchuria Railway, if the issue of unifying the four political powers in Manchuria, which is under suspension, can be resolved, then the South Manchuria Railway will become a purely commercial company, and the selection of the president will be different from the past. Therefore, it is currently planned to leave the position temporarily vacant and have the vice president perform the duties. In short, it is necessary to wait until President Uchida assumes the post of Foreign Minister before determining the government's attitude.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th. Uchida Mitsugu, president of the South Manchuria Railway, will return to Tokyo on the morning of the 12th. Count Uchida's acceptance of the post of Foreign Minister seems certain, and the appointment ceremony of the Foreign Minister may be held on the 13th.</p>

<h3>Support Smith</h3>
<p>As a Candidate for President in the Next Election</p>
<p>National Press Agency, New York, 10th. The Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, the largest newspaper organization in the United States, is headed by Scripps and Howard. Recently, the newspapers held an important political conference in New York, gathering chief editors from newspapers in various regions, and decided to support New York Governor Smith as a candidate for president in the next election. After the meeting, the newspapers disclosed a declaration, stating that whether the next president is Hoover or Roosevelt, the country will suffer a major blow that will be difficult to recover from for decades. The declaration also stated that the United States has been governed by a hesitant government for a long time and can no longer tolerate it. In the current era, decisive action should be taken to avoid delaying important national affairs. The Scripps-Howard newspaper chain has long been known for its independent nature. Each newspaper is free to express its opinions on all political positions in its local area. However, when it comes to federal politicians, they adopt a common stance. Now that preparations for the next presidential election are just beginning, the newspapers have suddenly issued this firm position, so the whole country is paying attention. Furthermore, before President Hoover was elected, the Scripps newspapers issued a declaration stating that if Hoover could be nominated by the Republican Party, the newspapers would support Hoover. But if Hoover cannot obtain the Republican nomination and Smith can obtain the Democratic nomination, then the Scripps newspapers will change their attitude and support Smith. At that time, the Republican and Democratic party supporters were angry at the newspapers' "disregard for party discipline." However, Hoover was eventually elected to the White House because of the support of the newspapers.</p>

<h3>State Parliament Re-election</h3>
<p>National Press Agency, Sydney, 11th. The New South Wales State Parliament in Australia was re-elected today. According to preliminary reports,</p>
<p>the current government faction is victorious. The election in New South Wales this time is attracting attention from all of Australia because the dispute between the former Labor government's Prime Minister Lang and the federal government over debt will be practically resolved in this election. Lang is the leader of the Labor Party in the state. When he was Prime Minister, he tried to reduce the interest on the state's debt. Later, he wanted to suspend payments for twelve months to ease the financial difficulties and relieve the people. The federal government did not approve of this, accusing Lang of attempting to default on debt and lose credibility, and obstructing the cooperation plan agreed upon by the premiers' conference to seek federal rehabilitation. Therefore, the Federal Parliament decided to collect taxes on behalf of New South Wales to protect the state's debt. However, Lang insisted on not yielding and immediately sealed off the tax offices the next day, withdrew bank deposits back into the treasury, and sent armed teams to escort railway revenue directly into the treasury, resulting in a protracted dispute. Until a month ago, the Governor of New South Wales (the Federal Governor and the Governors of the states are all representatives of the British King and are not elected) suddenly and swiftly dismissed Lang from the position of Prime Minister and temporarily appointed his political opponent, Stephen, the leader of the Australian Unity Party, as acting Prime Minister, reversing what Lang had done. Therefore, if the Labor Party wins this election, Lang will still head the government, and the dispute between the state and the federation will see a resurgence. If the current government's Australian Unity Party wins, then the dispute that is enough to endanger the federation can be practically resolved.</p>
<h3>Suspect Arrested in Lindbergh Baby Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 10th. Bruno Hauptmann, a suspect in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, has now been arrested.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Jersey, 10th. A maid in the home of Mrs. Morrow, Lindbergh's mother-in-law, in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case,</p>
<p>was suspected and interrogated by the police three times. She was scheduled to be re-examined today, but the maid committed suicide by poisoning herself in Mrs. Morrow's kitchen. According to the New Jersey police, the maid's sister, Ada Sharpe, left for England four days after Dr. Condon handed over the ransom of 50,000 yuan to the kidnapper's contact person. The police have now telegraphed London, asking the British police to inquire with Ada Sharpe. The police officers handling the kidnapping case said that the suicide of Mrs. Morrow's maid is sufficient to prove the police officers' suspicion that she knows the inside story of the case. The reason why the police officers have this suspicion is because the maid's statements about her movements on the night of the kidnapping were contradictory. Yesterday, the police showed the maid a photo of Hauptmann, who had a criminal record. The maid identified him as the male companion who was with her on the night of the kidnapping. Therefore, the police have now arrested Hauptmann. Mrs. Morrow said that she did not believe the Sharpe sisters were related to the kidnapping case.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hopewell, 11th. According to the police department, Dr. Condon has identified Hauptmann from the portrait as the person to whom he handed over the ransom of 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>Northeast Regime</p>
<h3>Entirely Controlled by Japanese</h3>
<p>The Puppet Fengtian Provincial Office is Contracted by Kanai</p>
<p>Special Attention is Paid to Education in the Northeast</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence, According to people from Shenyang, the situation in the Northeast has changed greatly since the arrival of the investigation team. At first, the Japanese were wary of the investigation team and still used puppets to come on stage, but were manipulated from behind. When the investigation team arrived, the Japanese were deeply worried that these puppets would defect and expose their various conspiracies and activities in the Northeast to the investigation team. Therefore, they openly took sole control of all the real power of the puppet state. The puppet government's decrees were all issued by Komai, the chief of the general affairs department of the puppet cabinet. The decrees of the provinces were also issued by the Japanese. For example, the decrees of the puppet Fengtian Provincial Office were handled entirely by Kanai, the chief of the general affairs department. The various departments under the province were governed by the Japanese chiefs of the general affairs sections of the departments. Hirakawa, the chief of the general affairs section of the education department, was known as the supreme director. The Japanese... Our nation, recently paid special attention to education in the Northeast. In the education department, in addition to the director Wei Huanzhang, the chiefs of the four sections, three were Japanese. In places such as... learning... jobs, all... Japanese.... These Japanese are all handling... education in Korea and have high experience. For example, Saito, the chief of the academic affairs section, has been handling education in Korea for more than 20 years. Takeomura, the chief of social affairs, has been handling education in Korea for more than 10 years. The... key officials of the... are listed on the left, which can be seen from the list. Director Wei Huanzhang, Chief of the General Affairs Section Hirakawa (Japanese), Chief of the Academic Affairs Section Saito (Japanese), Chief of the Social Affairs Section Yi Chengyan (Chinese) but the section chiefs of that section are Japanese Tanemura), Chief of the Supervision Section, the Japanese has not arrived, replaced by Wang Xingyuan, and there are three Japanese supervisors who have not arrived. In addition, at every meeting of the department, in addition to the director's speech, the Japanese Hirakawa chairs the meeting. The power to use people and administer affairs is all in his hands. The director may not approve a word. The other departments are all similar. However, the chief of the police department is directly assumed by the Japanese Mitani Kiyoshi, who commands the police bureau, security bureau, and commercial group. The leaders of these three organizations are all traitors who pander to the Japanese. The chief of the police bureau is like Qi Enming, who has more than 5,000 policemen. The security bureau has more than 700 soldiers. The head of the commercial group is Wang Tongxuan, who has more than 1,000 soldiers. Although the leaders of the above three organizations are pro-Japanese, the soldiers and lower-level officers are quite aware of righteousness. The Japanese, in view of this, plan to replace all the chiefs of the branch bureaus with Japanese and add Japanese police in each branch bureau. This plan is said to be implemented soon. Now the people in the Northeast are in deep waters and desperately hope that the government will send troops to rescue them, but it is a pity that the government does not seem to care.</p>
<p>Liaodong Self-Defense Army</p>
<h3>The Process of Recapturing Xinbin</h3>
<p>The Self-Defense Army Urgently Hopes for Government Assistance</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence, According to people from Shenyang, after the September 18th Incident, Yu Zhishan, the commander of the Liaoning East Border Garrison, had an ambiguous attitude and did not hesitate to sell out the country for glory, willingly being used by the Japanese invaders. However, the officers and soldiers under his command were all patriotic, so when the League of Nations investigation team first arrived in Shenyang, the righteous army on the east border rose up, showing the spirit of our nation, desperately resisting the Japanese to fulfill their destiny of fighting for the country. Yu Zhishan's elite troops were Tang Juwu's regiment and Liao. Both are trusted by Yu. Now both have revolted. On April 21, Tang Juwu was stolen in Huanren County and took the post of commander of the Liaoning Self-Defense Army, leading his troops to resist the Japanese. Currently, more than ten counties on the east border are under the control of the Self-Defense Army, with great momentum and support from the people. Unexpectedly, on May 3, Yu, leading three regiments and several Japanese officers, got off the train at Nan Za Mu and went straight into Lu Street in Xinbin County, contacting Li Runchun's Self-Defense Army, resulting in a fierce battle for three days and nights. There were many casualties on both sides. There was heavy rain. Li personally went to the front line to supervise the battle. Several bullets landed next to his feet, and he fell and then got up, unyielding. He finally ran out of ammunition and was forced to temporarily retreat to Erlaihu Street in Huanren, supervising his troops and preparing for a counterattack. When the rebel army entered Xinbin, the soldiers had no discipline. The merchants of Xinbin, unable to bear the disturbance of the rebel army, sent representatives to visit Li, requesting him to return to defend Xinbin. On May 12, he resolutely led his team to launch a counterattack. After a stalemate for five days, Yu was short of ammunition, and on May 21, he retreated from Xinbin to the Shancheng Town (Yu's old nest) area in Qingyuan. The Self-Defense Army returned to Xinbin on the 24th. After these two bloody battles, the soldiers suffered more than 200 casualties. With Tang Juwu sending troops to assist, the Yu army was heavily surrounded, so it was recaptured so quickly. From then on, the Self-Defense Army's progress was even smoother, but the inability to replenish ammunition is a pity. If the government can provide assistance, it will be able to recover our great rivers and mountains.</p>
<p>League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Delegation's Visit to Qingdao</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the League of Nations Investigative Commission arrived in Beiping from the Northeast, Chairman Lytton, along with the German and Italian representatives, traveled to Qingdao. The Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, and the Japanese representative, Yoshida, also accompanied them. They boarded the train from Beiping on the evening of the 8th, arrived in Jinan at 9:25 AM on the 9th, and departed for Qingdao at 10:15 AM. The details of their transit are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcome at the Station: When the investigative commission departed from Beiping, the provincial government received a telegram from Beiping, reporting the special train’s departure. Chairman Han Fuqu immediately notified Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie to prepare for the reception. This morning (9th) at 7:00 AM, Wen, accompanied by the Municipal Government Secretary-General Wang Naikui, the Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section Jiang Shijian, and the Chief of the General Affairs Section Wang Ying, arranged the reception in the waiting room of the Jinpu Railway Station. They also coordinated with the Jiaoji Railway regarding the transfer of the investigative commission’s special train from the Jinpu line to the Jiaoji line. After 8:00 AM, welcoming personnel from various agencies and organizations arrived at the station one after another. These included the provincial government representative, Director of the Construction Department Zhang Honglie; the provincial party headquarters representative, Wang Tiansheng; the provincial government councilor, Zhou Xiuwen; the Director of the Public Works Bureau Zhang Hongwen; the Manager of the Salt Revenue Audit Office Li Zhifan; the Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee Ge Guangting;</p>
<p>the Chief of the Traffic Department Tan Shuku; the Chief of the Police Section Dai Shihan; and representatives from various agencies and organizations, totaling several hundred people. The Chief of the Public Security Bureau, Wang Kairu, led the police to the station to maintain order, and a military band was present. National flags were placed on the platform, and refreshments were prepared in the waiting room. Consuls from various countries in Jinan, such as the German Consul Higu Xian, the American Consul Mi Hede, the British Consul Gen Zhuozhi, and the Japanese Consul Nishida, also arrived at the station to welcome the delegation.</p>
<p>Special Train Arrives: At about 9:00 AM, the armored train, Beiping No. 1, commanded by Dai Hongbin, led the way into the station. At 9:25 AM, the special train arrived. The Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, alighted first. The commission's chairman, Lytton, the German representative, Xini, the Italian representative, Marescotti, the Japanese representative, Yoshida, and accompanying personnel Liu Chong</p>
<p>jie, You Mijian, Ruina, Yan Deqing, Ye Jirong, and others also alighted. Gu introduced the welcoming personnel to Lytton, and they shook hands as a greeting. They then moved from the platform to the waiting room to rest. It was observed that the train consisted of a total of fourteen cars.</p>
<p>Lytton's Remarks: The provincial government representative, Zhang Honglie, met with Lytton, shook hands, and exchanged pleasantries. He conveyed Chairman Han's apologies for being unable to welcome him at the station due to a foot ailment, and that he was sent as a representative to express welcome. Lytton expressed his thanks. Subsequently, reporters from various newspapers, introduced by Representative Gu, met with Lytton and conversed with him (Representative Gu translating). The reporters first said that the members of the investigative commission had come to their country to investigate for world peace, and had surely suffered greatly in their trip to the Northeast. They asked Lytton what his impressions of the trip to the Northeast were. Lytton replied that he could not express his impressions, as he was currently organizing the investigation materials and needed to wait until the overall report was prepared to speak. However, he could say that the result of the effort to investigate in the Northeast was that they obtained a great deal of material. The reporters then inquired about his hopes for the Sino-Japanese problem. Lytton replied that he was unable to express his hopes at the moment. However, although the Sino-Japanese problem was different from previous international disputes, the principles were the same. The League of Nations, as a facilitating mechanism for the Far East Sino-Japanese problem, had not yet been applied. Regarding the interpretation of treaties, the obligations and rights of both countries, as long as they followed the principles and spirit of the League of Nations and acted with fairness, could be resolved satisfactorily. The reporters asked about the difficulties encountered by the commission along the way. Lytton replied that, naturally, there were many difficulties during the investigation in the Northeast, but some were resolved after explanations from various authorities, which was unavoidable under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Gu Weijun's Remarks: After Lytton spoke, the reporters then spoke with the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun. Gu briefly said that although they had encountered unexpected difficulties in the Northeast, it was their duty to do so. The investigative commission's visit to Qingdao was expected to last until tomorrow evening, and they would return to Jinan the day after. Whether they would tour Qufu and Mount Tai was still under discussion. The location for the commission to compile its report would be decided after returning to Beiping from Qingdao. The reporters also asked about Representative Gu's personal itinerary. Gu replied that he planned to go to Nanjing after returning to Jinan from Qingdao and intended to stay for two days because the matter was important and he would still need to come north. Regarding the commission's trip to Japan, that would be discussed after returning to Beiping. Finally, Gu said that he hoped the people of the country would not forget the Northeast and that the whole country should work together to solve this major problem, as only then could it be resolved. This was not only his personal opinion but also what the people of the Northeast entrusted him to convey to everyone.</p>
<p>Special Train Departs Eastward: After the conversation, everyone re-boarded the train, and the welcoming personnel remained on the platform to see them off. Lytton repeatedly said that the weather was very hot, that everyone had worked hard to come from afar, and thanked them. He also asked Representative Gu what organizations the people at the station were from, and Gu told him one by one. At this time, Zhang Honglie also boarded the train to discuss the commission's itinerary and reception with Gu, and only disembarked after the special train crossed onto the Jiaoji line. At this time, the special train had changed to a Jiaoji Railway locomotive. The Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, Ge Guangting, and the Chief of the Traffic Department, Tan Shuku, accompanied the train to provide hospitality, and the Secretary Zhou Songnian, the Chief of the Mechanical Department Song Dusheng, and the Chief of the Police Department Zai Shihan, were sent on a separate train to lead the way. At 10:15 AM, the investigative commission's special train departed eastward from Jinan to the sound of military music. Along the Jiaoji Railway line, Han Fuqu had telegraphed the 29th Division Commander Cao Fulin, ordering all stationed troops to provide adequate security as the commission's train passed through their territory, to ensure safety. After the commission arrived in Qingdao, it was scheduled to stay at the mayor's official residence (9th).</p>

<h3>Rapid Advance of the Red Movement</h3>
<p>Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that the Tokyo Toda Police Station recently arrested four members of the Communist Youth League, including the organization director, Terao Gisan, and the propaganda director, Kurosawa Toshio, at a secret meeting in Kami-ochiai, Ochiai-cho. They also captured Miyakawa Den, the technology director of the Communist Youth League, at Suwa Villa No. 2 in Tozawa-cho. These individuals were all graduates of the Imperial University and other universities and specialized schools, and were leaders of the central department of the Communist Youth League. Their propaganda materials included magazines such as "Lenin Youth" and "Proletarian Youth."</p>
<p>They are working extremely hard to promote the Prussian Cultural Alliance and have established school classes and factory classes in various places, mainly in major specialized schools under the Tokyo Prefecture, organizing autonomous student associations and secretly contacting reading groups on the front lines to form a large-scale left-leaning cultural movement. Furthermore, the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reports that after the incident of nurses at the Matsuzawa Hospital in Tokyo conspiring to beat Miyahara Kokichi to death, a thorough investigation revealed that the nurses at the hospital had been intensely exposed to red propaganda, which led to the agitation of their thoughts and resulted in this act. Additionally, the Kokumin Shimbun reports that the red movement within the Simple Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Communications in Mita, Shiba Ward, Tokyo, which had temporarily subsided after being suppressed by the authorities last November, has recently been revived by the bureau's staff members, who are secretly using reading groups and research groups as a guise to expand the Communist Youth League's influence. The Metropolitan Police Department uncovered this and abruptly arrested important figures from the Statistics Section, the Loan Section, and the Original Book Section, including Moto Takeshi, Takeuchi Kazuko (female), Takasaki Eiji, Takahashi Zengo, Izumi Jiro, Ari Sakaesaburo, and Okubo Yoshio, and detained them separately at the Maru-san and Mita police stations. In summary, based on reports from various Japanese newspapers, it is evident that the red movement within Japan is advancing rapidly.</p>

<h3>Advancing to Suppress Red Bandits in Western Anhui</h3>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Huoqiu Still Occupied by Bandits</p>
<p>Guan's Troops Advance Towards Zhengyang</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Since the Red Bandits of Western Anhui once ravaged Zhengyang and occupied Huoqiu, reports of bandit activity in northern Anhui have been frequent, and the situation in the Changhuai region is tense. Representatives of the people from Huoqiu, Ying, Zhengyang, and Shou have been traveling to Beijing and Bengbu to appeal for troops. Initially, the central government, due to the spread of the Red Disaster in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region, gathered elite troops based on a comprehensive plan to launch a major suppression campaign. Therefore, the advance to suppress the bandits accumulated in Western Anhui was delayed. The 40th Independent Brigade, led by Song Shike, previously abandoned Huoqiu and stationed itself in Zhengyang, which was actually a measure to preserve the strength of its troops and not a genuine rescue of Zhengyang. The bandits occupying Zhengyang were actually coerced to leave by the local militia leader Yang Chengxuan's troops and the 2nd Regiment of the 2nd Security Brigade, led by Ni Rongxian. After Song's brigade heard that the bandits had retreated, they entered and stationed themselves in Zhengyang to pursue and suppress the bandits. Subsequently, the Huoqiu security team led by Sun Peiji, the militia led by Tian Yu and Yang Chengxuan, and thousands of members of the Red Spear Society and Yellow Spear Society launched a counterattack on Huoqiu. Sun's troops took the front, Yang's troops the left flank, and Tian's troops the right flank. They had</p>
<p>already reached the city of Huoqiu. Members of the Red Spear Society were climbing the city walls when three of them were killed by Sun Peiji's mortar fire, causing them to panic and retreat. The left and right flanks, restrained by this, also retreated one after another, and the effort failed. Furthermore, due to the lack of unity among the people and the lack of unified command, Huoqiu could not be recovered and is still occupied by the Red Bandits. Their outpost line is at Xindian, more than thirty li southwest of Zhengyang, and they have plans to counterattack Zhengyang at the right opportunity. Representatives of refugees from Ying Shang, Huoqiu, and Shou counties in northern Anhui have been continuously petitioning for troops to suppress the bandits in Beijing in order to save the remaining people. Recently, the central government's intentions have been moved, and they have ordered Xu Tingyao, the division commander of the 4th Division stationed in Bengbu, to lead his troops to Zhengyang. After receiving the order, Xu first sent Guan Linzheng's independent brigade stationed at Mentai Zi to depart. Guan's brigade arrived here by train from its defensive area at 8:00 AM today (10th). Xu Tingyao gathered the officers and soldiers of the brigade at the Public Education Center in the morning to give them a lecture. The Changhuai Water Police Bureau had previously hired six steamers and hundreds of civilian boats on their behalf. After the lecture, the officers and soldiers rested briefly and arrived at the riverbank in the afternoon to board the boats and head west along the Huai River. People from Shou and Bengbu in the brigade telegraphed the local gentry in Shou and Zhengyang to prepare for a welcome.</p>
<p>After Guan's brigade departed, the other units also prepared to depart successively, and the division headquarters will also move within days, leaving only a portion stationed in Bengbu. You Kaiyun, the deputy director of the division headquarters, has been newly appointed as the acting chief of the Bengbu Public Security Bureau by the Anhui government, replacing the previous chief, Zhao Chunpu, who has been transferred to the province. You arrived at the bureau at twelve noon today</p>
<p>to take over the seal and assume his duties. The vacant position of deputy director of the adjutant's office was filled by Xu Tingyao, who appointed Lieutenant Colonel Ding Zhenwu, the staff officer. In addition, the newly formed cavalry regiment of the Xu division, currently stationed in Guide, will also be transferred to Western Anhui to suppress the bandits, in order to annihilate the group of villains (10th).</p>

<p>Financial Problems in Fujian Province in the Future</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fang Shengtao, the acting chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, went to Tong'an in late May to command the suppression of bandits. Now that Zhangzhou has been recovered, he has assigned Zhang Zhen, the commander of the 49th Division, to be responsible for the defense of Zhangzhou. He himself, together with Fan Zongchi, the representative of the 19th Route Army, departed from Zhangzhou for Xiamen on the 5th, and returned to the province by the Hai Cheng steamer from Xiamen on the 6th, arriving at noon on the 7th. It is heard that after Mr. Fang returns to the province, the most important thing is to plan finances. Because the current financial situation in Fujian Province is that the monthly income and expenditure differ by 150,000 yuan, and the expenses of various agencies have only been issued up to March. After the 19th Route Army entered Fujian, although the military pay was allocated by the central government, how to pay the anti-bandit expenses is indeed a major problem. Although the summer festival allocation has been repeatedly urged by the Civil and Financial Departments to the counties in advance, as of the 7th, only Shunchang, Xiapu, Fu'an, Ningde, Shaowu, Jian</p>
<p>ning, Taining, Guangze, Putian, Jianyang, and Songxi have delivered the funds, while the rest are unable to cope due to war, famine, and banditry. In the future, income will decrease and expenditure will increase. It is unknown how the authorities will handle this (June 7).</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Military-Police Joint Inspection Measures: Recently, robberies have frequently occurred in the areas near Songjiang, posing a threat to local security. Various local agencies, due to the recent end of the Shanghai War, are concerned that scattered soldiers may be hiding and causing trouble, and have recognized the need to organize joint military-police inspections to curb banditry. Yesterday, the county government invited the provincial security forces, the 88th Division, the tax police corps, and their respective officers to a meeting to discuss measures to maintain public order. It was decided that it was necessary to organize joint military-police inspections. Therefore, it was decided that the four military-police agencies would each contribute fourteen personnel to be stationed at the Yue Temple and the county government. Starting from Monday, they will patrol in groups, and the security corps will dispatch soldiers to guard the four city gates to check for criminals. Local public order should be stabilized.</p>

<p>County Education Association Strives for Education Funds: The County Education Association previously noted that the County Education Bureau intended to reduce the allocation of education funds for one month due to the shortfall in the collection of the grain tax surcharge last year. The association argued that the lives of school staff were already very difficult, and they had been indirectly affected by the Shanghai War, and it was more appropriate to find ways to provide relief rather than reduce education funds. Therefore, the association's eleventh executive committee meeting resolved to send a letter to the County Education Bureau to strongly argue for maintaining the original education funds, and to submit a petition to the county magistrate to order the Finance Bureau to strictly continue to collect the outstanding grain tax to enrich the local economy and benefit the development of education. It is learned that in addition to earnestly implementing the above resolution, Zhao Yunzang, the standing director of the association, also explained to Chen, the department head of the county government, and Yuan, the director of the Education Bureau, the hardship of not being able to reduce education funds, and requested them to find ways to support it. It is heard that Chen, the department head of the county government, highly values education as it relates to the local community, and is doing his best to assist. He has also contacted Director Yuan once, and the bureau is no longer able to insist on the proposed reduction of funds. Therefore, the proposal to reduce education funds is unlikely to become a reality.</p>

<p>Rice-Snatching Trend Spreads Throughout the County: This county suffered a disaster last year, and this year it has been affected by the Shanghai war. The silkworm market is also hopeless, leading to a desperate social and economic situation. The strong resort to taking risks, while the weak are left to perish. Therefore, the trend of snatching rice and robbing has occurred from time to time. Initially, rice-snatching was most prevalent in the seventh district, but it has since spread to the eighth and tenth districts. Now, it seems to be spreading throughout the entire county. On the night of the 7th of this month, at the home of Zhou Fen in Yangjiawan, District 10, fifteen or sixteen poor people wearing black headscarves suddenly broke down the door. They tied up Zhou, her son Renbao, and her daughter-in-law Chen, and beat them severely. They snatched four piculs of white rice, a gold ring, and three boxes of clothes. Renbao then took a gong to the roof and made a commotion, but he was dragged down by the bandits and struck in the jaw, rendering him immobile. Zhou's grandson Zuxing and granddaughter Rongzhen were also terrified. Afterwards, Zhou did not report the incident to the county to request an arrest. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 9th, another fifteen or sixteen similar poor people came, broke down the door, tied up the family members, and beat them severely. They again snatched four piculs of white rice, five cotton quilts, and a box of old clothes before fleeing. The total loss from both incidents is estimated at three or four hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Security Chief Captures Two Communists: Zhu Meiji, the security chief of the eighth district of this county, previously captured two communists, Pu Gengsheng and Tao Axiao, who had shot and killed Pu Tongqing, in Punanwang, District Nine, and Anzhen, District Eight.

Yesterday (the 11th) at 11:00 AM, Zhu, along with his team, escorted them to the city, presented them to the county government, and after interrogation by the department head, ordered them to be detained for investigation.</p>

<p>Investigation of Cai Zhongwei Case Completed and Reported: The Military Affairs Commission consulted the provincial government to order Magistrate Ma to investigate and report on the case of Cai Zhongwei, the captain of the Fourth Team of the Engineering Training Office of the Military and Political Department, who was accused of intimidating farmers and privately receiving subsidies in Houcheng in April. This case was previously reported in the newspaper. Now, Min Junzhong, the director of the Third Public Security Branch, sent inspector Chen Liang to the Second District Office to investigate. According to Shen Dander, the district chief, Cai Zhongwei led his team to the area in early April and requested food and reward money. The first time, ten silver dollars were given, the second time twenty dollars, and the third time seventy dollars. Several days later, Cai again requested rewards, and Cheng Yinfu, the assistant of this district, managed to give him eighty silver dollars. Several times in total, a total of one hundred and eighty silver dollars was rewarded, and there was no receipt. It is confirmed that when supervising the digging of trenches, Dai Xingren, the acting chief of Lei Dong Township, slapped Cai three times and unreasonably intimidated the farmers, saying that anyone who disobeyed orders would be shot. Director Min will report the findings to the county government through the general bureau and forward them to the provincial government for reply to the Military Affairs Commission for investigation.</p>

By the time people discovered it, she had already died. Chen felt remorseful and also committed suicide by taking opium paste. It was truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Grand Canal Project Stalled Due to Lack of Funds: The Grand Canal project, due to the suspension of funds, cannot be completed as scheduled. The critical situation has been reported in this newspaper. Now, people from Jiangbei have been sending telegrams requesting assistance. The telegrams are listed below: (1) The Jiangbei Flood Relief Association, Hu Zhen, Wang Jingting, Bao Xiangzhong, etc., telegraphed Ye Chucang to urgently expedite funding in Beijing, stating that the disaster in Jiangbei was caused by the breach of the dikes and that the construction was about to be completed. The telegram stated, "The heavenly disaster in Jiangbei has been tragically caused by the breach of the dikes. As the great project is about to be completed, we were celebrating together. Suddenly, we heard that there was a lack of funds, and there are signs that work will be suspended. All the work will be lost, and the disaster will be irreversible. The disaster is imminent, and we cannot remain silent. The national government has pledged one million yuan in aid, but the Ministry of Railways has only allocated one-tenth of that amount. You have consistently provided relief, and your contributions are for the people. We urge you to quickly present the situation to the national government and transfer all the promised funds to Yangzhou as soon as possible. This is the only way to reverse the disaster and prevent all previous efforts from being wasted. The survival of the canal dikes depends on this one action. We urgently await your instructions." (2) Jiangbei citizens Xia Zhongjin, Yan Weihan, Yin Xiaoqi, and others telegraphed the Rehabilitation Committee, stating, "Repairing the canal dikes will take place in five months, and the quality of the project is visible. We dare not blindly criticize, but with the flood approaching, the work is not yet complete, and two-thirds of it remains. Pausing the work will make it impossible to finish, The rehabilitation fund is in a lack of funds, and they cannot fully assist them. The office in Yangzhou cannot cope with the demands, causing panic at the moment. The mountain is only a basketful away from being finished, the committee must push for the completion. The committee will not make progress due to a lack of a basket full, and the aim of saving people from start to finish will be unfulfilled.</p>
<p>The committee will have the strength to be well prepared, in order to prevent stopping the engineering. Please specify clearly, to settle people’s hearts." (3) Zhu Shiseng telegraphed Wang Yiting in Shanghai, stating, "The Jiangbei river project urgently needs funds. Work has been suspended due to the lack of funds. The customs surcharge of 800,000 yuan has been approved by the national government and designated for the Jiangbei river project. I am now seeking to discuss this with Mr. Zhu Ziqiao to quickly allocate these funds to provide relief and alleviate the current emergency.</p>
<p>If this is not enough, 400,000 yuan can ensure a satisfactory outcome. Mr. Zi is very anxious about this and urges you to consider the suffering of the people in Jiangbei and proceed quickly. I am eagerly awaiting your reply." It is also heard that Vice Chairman Han of the office in Yangzhou hastily crossed the river yesterday to discuss the matter with Chairman Gu and the heads of the Department of Finance and Construction.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Petition to Ban Fast Boats: The Pinghu-Shanghai and Pinghu-Minnan shipping companies, which operate between Pinghu and Shanghai, have been adding more ships and increasing their speed due to business competition in recent years.

Now, the village committees along the line have submitted dozens of photographs showing the erosion of farmland and the overloaded weight of the boats, requesting the Department of Construction to strictly prohibit the operation of fast boats in order to protect farmland.</p>

<h3>Notes from Knocking on the Ancient Temple Bell (10) (9)</h3>
<p>The Reclusive Husband Who Doesn't Remove the Courtyard Grass</p>
<p>Twenty-three</p>
<p>When the villagers heard that a new teacher had arrived, men, women, old, and young all came to see, as lively as watching a new groom. We introduced each of them to Mr. Zhu. Mr. Zhu immediately gathered the children together and said, "Children, let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a farmer who only took care of planting fields for others, leaving his own field barren. Later, he had no rice to eat and starved to death. At the time of his death, a bird suddenly landed on the corner of the roof and chirped 'Cuckoo, cuckoo.' Since then, villagers have believed that this cuckoo bird is the old farmer who starved to death, calling on people every day to 'Cuckoo' to avoid starvation. You must have already known this story. But do you know what the cuckoo bird's chirping actually means? What it says is:</p>
<p>'Cuckoo cuckoo, Hurry up and cuckoo. If you don't cuckoo, No rice to cook porridge. If you want to cook porridge, Hurry up and cuckoo. Cuckoo cook porridge, Cook porridge cuckoo.'</p>
<p>'Let's all say it together, and we have to say it quickly and correctly. Whoever says it the best, I will give this little leather ball to him to manage.'</p>
<p>Everyone was very happy to recite. Wang Er's sister-in-law's youngest son, Ying'er, recited the fastest, without missing a single word. He was as happy as a living immortal and took on the responsibility of managing this little leather ball. Mr. Zhu then began to teach the children to pat this strange and fun thing. Even the older farmers had never seen this little ball, and some joined the children's ranks to pat it a couple of times, saying with a smile, 'This thing is fun!'"</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Local Nango, Tungda, Chungda Alumni Association will hold a meeting at 11:00 AM today on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA in the French Concession, and a gathering will also be held.

<p>The Venue Problem for the Mixed Tournament. The Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Club's mixed doubles tournament was originally scheduled to begin yesterday, with a total of three groups held at the French Chamber of Commerce. Although it could not be played due to rain, there were still many behind-the-scenes twists and turns. According to Sha Peng, secretary of the Grass Court Tennis Club, the Grass Court Tennis Club is not responsible for designating courts for the players in the preliminary and secondary matches, and the players must agree on the court themselves. Moreover, the courts of the French Chamber of Commerce, except for the Grass Court Tennis Club's special agreement to borrow them, cannot be used for temporary borrowing for matches. In the future, all kinds of matches of the Grass Court Tennis Club will be handled in this way. This is not a proper way to deal with the matter, as it is inconvenient for the players and it is difficult for the organizing side to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>The Mixed Tournament Order Has Been Rearranged. A total of eleven groups participated in the tournament. The order has already been announced, but there have been many changes in the pairing arrangements recently. The rearranged order is as follows:</p>
<p>First week</p>
<p>Fang En and La Bote vs. the Kremnov couple (Miss Fiss)</p>
<p>Livingston and Ma vs. Lin Baohua and Mrs. Manli</p>

<p>Jiang Daozhang and Jie Han vs. Kanafan Luo and Miss Ke Lazhou</p>

<p>Those ranked later</p>
<p>(1) Bao Hui'er and Miss La Ai Te vs. White and Mrs. Borden, (2) Bai Lunzhi and Miss Pi Luo Du Si Gen vs. the winner of "Meias and Miss Lan Er vs. Bu De and Miss Gu Bo."</p>

<p>Shocking News | World Games</p>
<h3>The Puppet State is Actually Allowed to Send Athletes to Participate</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Preparatory Committee on May 28 | Citing Previous Examples of the Philippines and India</p>
<p>Japan Reportedly Selected Yu Xiwei | Will Our Country Protest?</p>
<p>What are the Feelings of the Chinese People?</p>
<p>The 10th World Games will be held in Los Angeles, USA, starting on the 30th of next month. More than 50 countries will participate, as reported previously. Recently, shocking news has come that the members of the Games Organizing Committee actually approved the selection of athletes from the Manchurian Puppet State to participate on May 28. Shen Siliang, honorary director of the National Sports Association, solemnly declared that he cannot attend without his signature. Manchuria is Chinese territory, and now the flag of the Puppet State will be wavering in the Games field. Will our country's authorities rise up to protest?</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee Approves Puppet State Participation</h3>
<p>As the date of the Games is approaching and representatives from various countries are arriving in the United States one after another, the reception committee of the Games is extremely busy, and the Olympic Village is in a state of tension. The organizing committee of the Games held its 29th plenary staff meeting on the night of May 28. The number of countries currently registered to participate is 51, with approximately 2,000 athletes, excluding team leaders and coaches. The previous Amsterdam Games had 46 participating countries. This year, both the number of countries and the number of people have broken all previous records. The only member country that has not sent athletes to participate is China. Most surprisingly, the Games actually decided to recognize the Manchurian Puppet State's participation in the Games and approved the Puppet State's participation on the grounds of previous examples of the Philippines and India. The Philippines and India are not independent countries recognized by the world but have already obtained the right to participate in the Games' group military position. Therefore, the Games disregarded China's sovereign control over Manchuria and simply allowed its participation. It is hoped that the Chinese people will quickly find a way to drive the Manchurian flag out of Los Angeles.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Games Resolution Record</h3>
<p>The meeting record of the Games meeting on the night of May 28 is recorded below. (1) After the end of this Games, the Anglo-American International Athletics Championships will be held in San Francisco on August 14.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese delegation entrusted this Games to contact the German delegation on its behalf to hold the Japan-Germany International Athletics Championships in San Francisco. It was resolved to start contacting Germany immediately.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to previously registering to participate in field hockey, India has now added registration to participate in track and field and swimming. It was resolved to allow them to participate.</p>
<p>(4) The "Manchurian government" entrusted the Japanese delegation to register with this Games on its behalf to send two athletes to participate in track and field. It was resolved to allow the country to join in accordance with the previous examples of India and the Philippines participating in this Games.</p>
<h3>Will Yu Xiwei Be a Representative?</h3>
<p>To Be Confirmed</p>
<p>According to the Puppet State's Shuntian Gongbao, the athlete sent by the Puppet State to participate in the World Games is a certain Yu from Andong County, who recently won the 800-meter race (hosted by the Puppet State) in the Liaoning Provincial Games, with a score of 2 minutes and 2.2 seconds. Japanese newspapers widely reported that this person is Yu Xiwei, but whether this is true remains to be verified.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Will Not Participate</h3>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia, 10th. The technical committee of the Yugoslavia Sokol Sports Association has confirmed that it will not participate in the World Games held in Los Angeles, USA.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Without Major Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Not Exceeding Four Tael Spread</p>
<p>Yesterday, after several days of rising gold prices, there was a reaction, and the market showed a sluggish trend. The market was quite calm, and from morning to noon, the price spread did not exceed four taels. In the end, there was a slight drop of a few cents. The cash flow of different firms varied, with most selling off and short sellers buying. Market sentiment seemed weak. Although the silver market fell, it was not considered significant, and the opening price was low. Subsequently, the market fluctuated, but foreign exchange tended to stabilize, and the final price was just over 724 taels. The market will be closed next Saturday. This week, although there were no major changes, the market was in a state of consolidation. Initially, large gold bars continued to rise, but downstream demand decreased, resulting in a low price of 711 taels and 8 mace. However, spot goods were scarce, especially as a certain bank showed active trading. Therefore, the longs sought to exploit the situation and raised the swap rate. The market price gradually advanced, frequently rising by more than ten taels, and reached a high price of 729 taels by Friday. Afterwards, the Kwong Syndicate sold off, leading to a softening trend. Overall, the total increase for the week was 17 taels and some change, up 9 taels and 1 mace compared to last Saturday. Transactions among various firms showed that firms like Qian Changxiang, Yifengyong, and Dalian Syndicate were mostly long positions, while firms like Run Changyu, Yuanmao, Yongda, and Decheng were short positions. The recent total transaction volume was about 23,000 taels. The detailed situation of yesterday's market is recorded below:</p>
<p>Result Slightly Down Four Cents</p>
<p>The opening price for the July contract was down 7 cents, at 724 taels and 5 mace. Although the price of large gold bars fell another 1/16 to 1/8, the silver price fell 1/8, and private telegrams showed only a small decrease of 1/16. The European market was flat, which was a lingering effect of the previous day's sudden drop. (However, before the official opening, the unofficial market had traded at 27-28 taels). Tongtaichang, Bingxing, Yuhe, Hongkangyong, and others were the first to sell, while the Dalian Syndicate and Wanxing bought. The market price fell from 25 taels to 22 taels. The October USD exchange rate was 31.625, and the June USD exchange rate was 30.06875. Suddenly, Sumitomo absorbed the October USD contract at 5.625. Buyers in the market became aggressive, with Bingxing, Yuhe, Yuanmao, Yongshunli, Zhifengyong, and others buying in, and the price rose by more than 3 taels, reaching 25 taels and 7 mace at 9:20 AM. Hengyu, Hongkangyong, Futaixing, and others sold, and the price decreased by one tael to 24 taels and 6 mace. At 9:30 AM, there was no fluctuation in various exchange rates, and the internal market was still strong. The next month's USD swap rate was 30.8125. Mitsui and Huabi swapped the near-term GBP contract at 0.0625, and the price increased to 25 taels and a half. Afterwards, the price fluctuated by about one tael. Subsequently, Yifeng, Hongkangyong, Yuanmao, Yongyuan, Tai, and others sold, and HSBC sold the August GBP contract at 1.81875, and the price fell by more than 2 taels, reaching 23 taels at 10:30 AM. Although Yifeng and others sold a lot afterwards, fortunately, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Xiexingyong, and Yuanyongtai all bought in. The USD was bought by Macao Commercial Bank at 0.5 yuan, and the Central Bank sold the last half of the June contract at 30.75, which was bought in by the bank, and the gold price was raised by about 2 taels. From 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM, the spread was one tael. At 11:10 AM, it was 24 taels and 9 mace. Afterwards, Wanxing, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongyifeng, and others continued to sell, and the price depreciated by more than one tael, reaching 23 taels and 2 mace at 11:30 AM. At that time, the price stabilized. Near noon, Zhifengyong, Hongkangyong, and retail short sellers came to cover their positions, and the price suddenly rose by about 2 taels, reaching 25 taels. The exchange rate was stable, and the October USD could be sold at 0.5 yuan. At the close, it was 24 taels and 8 mace, slightly down 4 cents compared to the previous day. Hengxing and others sold again, and the price continued to trade at 24 taels and 3-4 cents. The value of goods was down by 3 cents. The maximum price for half a day was 25 taels and 7 mace, and the minimum was 22 taels, with a difference of 3 taels and 7 mace. The published price was still 793 taels, with a borrowing rate of about 70 taels. The registration fee and water supplement were both 25 taels, and the red bar was gradually increased by 8 taels and 2 mace and 5 cents.</p>
<p>Different Firms Trade Differently</p>
<p>According to surface statistics, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Shunli, Dadecheng, and Xiexingyong were all buyers. Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Yuanmao, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, and Huitai had mixed buying and selling. Yuhe bought more than it sold. Hongkangyong, Yuandayong, Futaixing, Hengxing, and Yifeng were all sellers. The Dalian Syndicate bought a total of more than 300 taels and sold 100-200 taels. The Kwong Syndicate sold a total of 1700-1800 taels, indicating that the long positions were being unwound.</p>
<h3>Domestic UK and US Exchange Markets Seem Favorable</h3>
<p>Each Down 0.0625</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market continued to fall, but exchange rates showed a different trend. The UK to US rate continued to decrease slightly, and the US to UK rate rebounded. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The domestic bank market seemed favorable, initially stable, then loose, and then firm again. The final result was that both UK and US exchange rates each decreased by 0.0625 compared to the previous evening. However, the gold market showed a downstream trend, so hedging was appropriate, selling the October USD contract and buying taels. The borrowing rate was still between 70 taels, with a total transaction volume of about 600,000-700,000 yuan. Macao Commercial Bank still had a good appetite, and about 100,000 pounds of GBP were traded between banks. The gold firms had slight inflows and outflows. HSBC continued to sell, but there were no major international news. In the afternoon, there was no market as usual on Saturdays. This week's overall assessment showed that the GBP was flat in both the open and unofficial markets, the USD decreased by 0.0125 in the open market, and decreased by 0.01875 in the unofficial market.</p>

<p>USD exchange rate: The domestic market fluctuated by 0.0125 during half a day. The swap rates for June and July differed by 0.0125, and the swap rates for July, August, September, and October differed by 0.025.

<h3>Large Gold Bar Telegram Reported Price Increase</h3>

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Very Sluggish</h3>
<p>Price Slightly Declining, Trend Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange's bond spot and futures market conditions were as follows: Spot trading was scarce, with only 10,000 yuan traded throughout the day. The futures market was also very sluggish. The market atmosphere was consistently extremely cold. The morning trading volume was only 685,000 yuan, and the afternoon trading volume was only 1.26 million yuan, for a total of 1.945 million yuan. Among these, salt tax bonds accounted for 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The 1920 Customs Consolidated Tax Bonds accounted for over 300,000 each. The remaining bonds had very low trading volume. As for the trends of various bonds, both supply and demand sides were very clear. Large investors were waiting and watching, and small investors were also entering and exiting infrequently. Therefore, prices did not fluctuate significantly. However, due to quieter demand, prices were more depressed than the previous day. For example, June futures of Consolidated Salt Tax Bonds and Consolidated Tax Bonds each fell 7-8 cents, and the remaining bonds also fell slightly by 3-4 cents. Only the 1926 Reorganization bonds had unchanged prices. The spot price of the 1919 Public Welfare Bond was slightly higher by 6 cents compared to the previous day. Considering the market situation, it seems difficult to turn the situation around temporarily. It is feared that there will be no development before the settlement of the previous session.</p>
<p>Bond Type Spot/Future, Previous Close, Final Close, Change from Previous Day, Transaction Volume</p>
<p>1926 Spot, 36.80, 36.80, Unchanged, 25,000</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of the New York Stock Market This Week</h3>
<p>Report from American Eastern Bank</p>
<p>The New York stock market this week, after the continuous rise at the end of last week, initially showed a reactive decline. However, shortly after the passage of the bonus case and the unemployment relief case, merchants inevitably developed a sense of aversion, fearing that the national budget would still not be able to maintain balance. Therefore, the stock market continued to fall, not far from the lowest record. Fortunately, industrial stocks were able to stand firm when they were half a point away from the low, and by Friday, famous securities stocks were able to compete fiercely. The Oppenheim Motors stock rose by more than 21 points in one day. This extreme advance was due to a large number of short-covering.</p>
<p>The business situation this week was also very good. The freight tonnage of the iron and steel industry was more than last week, and the American wheat situation was also good. According to the Department of Agriculture's statistics, last year's winter harvest was 14,660,000, a low figure not seen since 1925. Automobile production increased by 3,000 vehicles compared to last week, but the news from the steel industry was not good. Looking at the situation from all sides, there has been definite progress recently. According to general opinion, the decline in the New York stock market is already far beyond the general business situation. Therefore, after the government's finances are rectified, the stock market will definitely improve. The Dow Jones index for this week is attached on the left:</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market is Declining Daily</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is showing signs of failure. Due to the high base price of local yarn and the cheapness of raw materials, the price of cotton yarn itself is low. Furthermore, the domestic socio-economic situation is depressed, rural areas are bankrupt, and the people are impoverished. As a result, actual sales are stagnant, and world commodity prices are falling sharply, reaching unprecedented lows. Therefore, Japanese merchants are selling yarn everywhere, engaging in intense competition. North China is being filled with their yarn, which is severely impacting the local yarn market. Comparing the price of local yarn with the world market, it is uniquely high, so how can the yarn market be maintained? Fortunately, the factories in Shanghai that stockpile goods do not have large inventories, so yarn prices are temporarily higher than cotton prices. The most important key factor is the actual demand for cotton.</p>
<p>The Selling of Cotton via Public Bidding is Not Over</p>
<p>The opening of the market before public bidding was stable as foreign cotton prices rebounded. However, the price of the far-term futures contract declined, and the price of each month’s contracts (2nd, 3rd, 4th) declined by 5-6-7-8 cents as the raw cotton price declined. The market sentiment was weaker in the afternoon, and the selling pressure was high, with the prices of each month’s contracts declining by 5–7 cents. The total volume of the transactions throughout the day was 12,300 bales. The selling companies and volume of bales were as follows: 850 bales for Suilong, 1350 bales for Rongxing, 700 bales for Xiesheng, 1250 bales for Xincheng, 850 bales for Yichang, 550 bales for Dachangcheng. The buying companies and volume of bales were as follows: 800 bales for Tongyu, 950 bales for Tianlong, 750 bales for Yicheng, 850 bales for Yongda, 500 bales for Yuantai, and 400 bales for Changfeng. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Public Bidding Closing Prices, Change, Account Balance, October 1479, Down 2, 41,400</p>
<p>July 1483, Down 12, 17,050, November 1476, Down 12, 32,400</p>
<p>August 1477, Down 13, 29,000, Total 154,050</p>
<p>September 1477, Down 13, 34,200</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Are Mediocre</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain mediocre. The total purchases from various provinces were 947 bales, and purchases from the same industry were 67 bales. The market price decreased by 5 cents to 1.5 taels. Purchases from visiting merchants were 252 bales, 15 bales for Ningbo, 25 bales for Qingdao, 505 bales for Guangdong, and 150 bales for Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market is Declining</h3>
<p>The cotton market remained weak, and the decline was severe, showing a downward trend. However, US cotton saw a slight rebound. Local market sentiment remained weak, and a decline was expected long ago. Due to the shortage of bottom goods, the longs were tightening their grip. Currently, with the gloomy global situation, the American Eastern Cotton Company, the Shanghai branch of the US Cotton Exchange, was canvassing in the market, offering Mitter M2 at 27 taels, with 10,000 bales available, with a rebate of 1 tael still possible. This cotton can be used to produce 20-count yarn. However, Shin Yick Factory, mindful of the sluggish global trend, dared not purchase it. As this news spread, a panic arose in the market, and large investors sold off, causing the market to fall further. However, general cotton merchants continued to buy, adding to their long positions. But compared to foreign cotton, the price level of local cotton was still far apart.</p>
<p>Zheng Bidding Down Another Half Tael</p>
<p>The Zheng Bidding opened with foreign cotton rebounding, but there were still many sellers in the market, and the prices of each month's contracts fell by 2-3 cents. In the afternoon, with the US cotton selling at extremely low prices, Xincheng heavily liquidated, and the prices of each month's contracts fell another 3-4 cents. The prices of the July and August contracts fell below the 9 tael mark. The total transaction volume for the day was 58,300 piculs. The selling companies and volumes were: Xincheng 5,400 piculs, Yukang 1,200 piculs, Renfeng 1,400 piculs, Yi Da 1,200 piculs, Yongda 1,400 piculs, Yuchang 1,400 piculs, Yichang 1,000 piculs. The buying companies and volumes were: Yuanda 4,500 piculs, Changhe 2,800 piculs, Shenchang 2,500 piculs, Ruida 2,000 piculs, Gengfeng 1,100 piculs. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Bidding Closing Prices, Change, Account Balance, October 2970, Down 40, 97,500</p>
<p>July 2890, Down 40, 48,900, October 2990, Down 55, 86,300</p>
<p>August 2900, Down 70, 80,500, Total 313,200</p>
<p>No Spot Cotton Transactions</p>
<p>There were absolutely no transactions in spot cotton, and the yarn price continued to decline, creating this terrible situation. The source of Yao cotton was 900 bales.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Rebounds Ten Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was calm and firm.

<h3>New Cotton Progresses Smoothly</h3>
<p>The American Eastern Cotton Company received a telegram from New York on June 9, stating that the cotton market buying was weak, the trend was uncertain, and the local securities market was also weak again. These are all phenomena that discourage market sentiment. Sellers were mostly speculators closing positions. The industry slightly bought in when prices fell. There was not much trading in spot cotton, and fabric trading was sluggish. The new cotton crop progresses smoothly.</p>

<h3>Dantu's New Cocoon Shipments Are Not Smooth</h3>
<p>Cocoon Prices Too Low, Silkworm Costs Not Covered</p>
<p>Most Is Self-Dried, Reeled, and Sold as Silk</p>
<p>In various towns and villages in Dantu, the spring silkworm farming has been greatly reduced this year. In addition, the weather has been unfavorable, silkworm diseases are rampant, and many leaves have been shed. The cocoon production is extremely low, and the cocoon markets have few shops for rent. Only local silk manufacturers are setting up scales to limit the purchase of cocoons. The purchase prices are very low. The highest price for improved breeds is 24-25 yuan lower. Silkworm farmers cannot cover their costs and mostly dry and reel the silk themselves, waiting for the opportune time to sell the raw silk. Therefore, the export of dry cocoons is not smooth, and the cocoon market has ended. The statistics for dry cocoons loaded onto the Beijing-Shanghai trains bound for Wuxi and Shanghai are only 500-600 bales.</p>
<h3>There Is Already a Move to Purchase Bud-Plucked Special Tea</h3>
<p>The purchase of bud-plucked special tea from Wudong and Dunxi has already been initiated by Ruichang and Dued Firms. However, the opening market price is 160-170 taels, 110-120 taels lower than last year. The selling price is extremely low, and therefore, Chinese tea merchants have already sent out large numbers of telegrams, notifying the stoppage of the purchase of this bud-plucked special tea. However, although the sales of ordinary special tea have slightly improved, the sentiment among various firms varies, and the market is still feared to decline rather than rise. Green teas such as needle-eyebrow and fine-eyebrow are still being sold as soon as they arrive, and there is no large stagnation of pearl tea. Ewo Foreign Firm has changed its approach to observing the situation of black tea from Qifu and other areas. Other firms have not seen much improvement in sales, and the market has significantly weakened compared to before.</p>
<h3>Wutun Tea Market Brief Report</h3>
<p>Wuyuan Tea Prices Difficult to Lower: This year's new tea from Wuyuan has seen a reduction in production volume. When the mountain households harvested their tea gardens, tea merchants rushed to buy it up. Only about one-third of the goods in the market remain unsold. Although sales in the Shanghai market are sluggish, and telegrams from warehouses are pessimistic, the mountain households are unwilling to immediately lower prices due to the high prices they previously sold at. The opening price for the Jiangwan and Gangtou markets in eastern Wuyuan is still required to be 80 yuan. The Enkou Tea Firm bought the reclaimed tea from Wukou in northern Wuyuan at a price of 64 yuan, which is not much different from the initial market price. Various firms, seeing these subsequent developments and the difficulty in lowering mountain prices, are mostly adopting a cautious approach and delaying purchases due to the poor Shanghai market.</p>
<p>Zhangshan Tea Harvesting and Production is Nearing Completion: Zhangshan Yunwu Tea in northern Wuyuan, due to its location on high cliffs and colder climate, develops more slowly than tea from the mountain plains. Every year, it must wait until the new tea from the entire county is on the market before it can begin harvesting. This year's weather in the mountains is even colder, and tea buds have sprouted even more slowly. According to farmers in the mountains, the new tea from this mountain has already begun to be harvested and produced a week ago. Due to sufficient labor, it will soon be completed. The quality and aroma of the tea are better than in previous years. However, affected by the sluggish Shanghai market, none of the past customers have yet come to the mountain to discuss prices.</p>
<p>Tunxi Tea Prices Are Increasingly Lower: After receiving news of the unfavorable Shanghai market situation, Tunxi's tea firms have significantly reduced the amount of tea they are buying. Although the source of tea arriving in recent days is gradually increasing, there are still few inquiries, and the market price has fallen from 80 yuan to 50 yuan. If the Shanghai market does not improve, most firms plan to complete one batch and then end the season to avoid losses.</p>
<h3>Grain: The Riverbank Rice Market Drops Another Ten Cents</h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday's rice market had over 30 rice dealers in the neighborhood and around 130 rice dealers in total, including those from the pier. The trading in the main street was not good. North Geng and Central Geng rice were each down by ten cents. The early and late rice markets were sluggish, but fortunately, there was not much cargo. The market price followed and shortened by ten cents. The Yanglu pointed rice was scarce, and the market situation was weak. The fermented rice had few stocks, and the situation stabilized.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday's early arrival market had a slight amount of early market trading, but it was very slow. In the afternoon, the unloading of rice on the riverbank was quite good. The price of thin rice decreased by ten cents at the opening of the market. Changxi North Geng rice was stable, and the quality was inferior. The Yanglu pointed rice and fermented rice were scarce and firm. In the two markets before and after, about 3,000 shi of rice were unloaded at the riverbank.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Falls in the Morning, Stabilizes in the Evening</h3>
<p>Jiangbei Syndicate Continues to Load</p>
<p>Various Rice Types Decreased by a Little Over Ten Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation: In the morning, following the tired wind of continuous days, the situation was very weak, and all rice types decreased by a little over ten cents. In the afternoon, the weather turned cloudy, and the market sentiment rebounded. The Jiangbei Syndicate and the villages in this area began to buy, and the market recovered and stabilized. However, the stock on the market was sufficient, and foreign firms continued to canvass for business. If there were no large syndicate purchases, it would be very difficult for the market price to rebound. A total of 3,000 bags of small Jiaomi rice were offered, priced at 10.04 yuan to 10.025 yuan. There were also 250 bags of old coarse rice, priced at 9.15 yuan. There were 500 bags of Kolarady coarse rice, priced at 9.37 yuan. There were 100 bags of Saigon No. 1, priced at 11.6 yuan. Also, new Jiangxi Jiyuan rice continued to arrive, with 150 bags offered, priced at 13.5 yuan. Except for the Jiangbei Syndicate asking about the small Jiaomi rice, all the others were purchased by the local village.</p>
<h3>Flour Market in Quiet Strength</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each contract seemed to turn calm. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat rebounded by about 3-5 cents, the opening price was higher than the previous day by 0.01 yuan. However, by the third session, the buying interest was quiet again, and the market softened. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, the large factories held their ground and showed no intention of releasing flour. In addition, the weather was unfavorable, with a high probability of rain, so although the transactions were scarce, the market atmosphere was quite stable. Observing the future, actual sales must improve and factory flour must have an outlet before there is hope. The final result was that the July contract was better than the previous day by 0.0125 yuan, the August contract was better by 0.01 yuan, the September contract was better by 0.0125 yuan, the October contract was better by 0.017 yuan, and the November contract was better by 0.015 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cereal Market Remained Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cereal market opened in the morning, and various market conditions showed a sluggish trend again. Although foreign wheat was quoted higher by thirty-five cents, due to the continuous arrival of new wheat from the mainland and the potential actions of Shanghai factories, mainland manufacturers were mostly observing. Under these circumstances, they were inevitably extremely passive. The price for July was as low as three taels, two maces, and eight fen, and for August, three taels and three maces and five fen, which shows the depression of the cereal market. When the afternoon session opened, it was initially flat, but later, as the flour market improved slightly, people's sentiment was also lifted. However, transactions remained stagnant, making development difficult. As a result, July decreased by two fen compared to the previous day, August decreased by one fen, September remained unchanged, October increased by one fen, and November remained unchanged. There were transactions of foreign wheat from the Hankou group, with Canadian No. 3 wheat at three taels and seven maces and five fen for delivery in Hankou. Local factories offered three taels and six maces, and negotiations were still ongoing.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Abundant Harvest of Sea Mouth Branches</h3>
<p>New Products to Arrive Within Two Weeks</p>
<p>Last year, Sea Mouth branches had a poor harvest, with no kernels available. Now, after extremes, a bountiful year has come. According to reports, this year's new goods are expected to be about 70% of the norm. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai within about half a month. Because the harvest is abundant, the cost will naturally be lower, so the market price is bound to be low.</p>
<h3>Metals: Yellow Brass Coins – Extreme Stillness Breeds Movement</h3>
<p>The yellow brass coin market had previously been very sluggish due to tight money conditions and the cessation of operations by various groups, causing sales to be under downward pressure. In recent days, the Hankou and Fujian groups have had demand, so the market is thriving due to the need for transactions, leading to a sense of movement from extreme stillness. The standard price has also risen sharply, estimated at thirty-eight taels per dan.</p>

<h3>The Prophecy of the Poem "The Sun of the East"</h3>
<p>— Shan Liao</p>
<p>The two chapters of the poem "The Sun of the East" in the "Airs of Qi" of the Book of Songs, the small preface says it is a poem of satire against decline. When I was a child, I read these two chapters of poetry, read them casually, and had no feelings. Now, when I reread it, I can't help but be shocked! These two chapters of poetry do not seem to be poems satirizing decline two thousand years ago, but rather modern maxims to spur the people! If you don't believe me, I'll write out the original poem of "Airs of Qi" first:</p>
<p>"The sun of the east! That beautiful maiden, is in my room! Is in my room, treads to me! The sun of the east! That beautiful maiden, is at my door! Is at my door, treads to my hair!" I only need to slightly tamper with it, changing the character for beautiful "shu" to the character for dwarf "zhuru"; changing the character for treads "lǚ" to the character for management "lǐ"; then, these two chapters of poetry become stimulating</p>
<p>mottos!</p>
<p>"The sun of the east! That dwarfish child, is in my room! Is in my room, manages me immediately! The sun of the east! That dwarfish child, is at my door! Is at my door, manages my hair!" The first chapter says that the dwarfs of the East have already entered our room! Having entered the room, then managing us is about to begin! Therefore, the poem says: "Manages me immediately!"</p>
<p>The second chapter says that the dwarfs of the East have already entered our door; having entered the door, then managing us has the opportunity to begin, so the poem says: "Manages my hair!"</p>
<p>Where is the room? Shanghai is the room.</p>
<p>Where is the door? The three northeastern provinces are the door.</p>
<p>On September 18th, the dwarfish child entered my door, managing us, the opportunity has begun.</p>
<p>On January 28th, the dwarfish child entered my room, managing us, is about to begin.</p>
<p>All patriotic youths of the world, every morning, read "The Sun of the East" three hundred times, the merit is immeasurable!</p>
<h3>The Poet's Room</h3>
<p>— Yingge</p>
<p>丨Miscellaneous Writings of the Old Capital, Nine丨</p>
<p>Please forgive me, I cannot tell you the poet's name, because he is still alive now, and he still needs to do some things for his life. If I were to write his name, it would more or less affect his</p>
<p>life; I feel unbearable in my heart. But I can tell you, he has a very unique name, and you will call out in surprise when you know it.</p>
<p>The poet came from a famous mountain half a month ago, twirling his yellow cane. Since settling in a corner of our courtyard, we haven't seen the poet's face all day long. Naturally, he went outside to look for his poetry. At night, when people have already fallen asleep in bed, the dogs barked, and at the same time, our poet returned. Apart from the clear "clack-clack" of his leather shoes hitting your brain, you only hear the poet humming lines of poetry in a long voice. Naturally, this is the only quatrain the poet found after a day's work.</p>
<p>The poet's hair is very long, black and thick, draped over his shoulders. His complexion? Needless to say, it is also very pale. When you see him, you might think he is a living ghost. And his room? It is also different from others. One day, the old maid was mopping the floor of the poet's room, and she called out seriously, "Master Zhou! Come and see." For a moment, I was called by her and ran over out of curiosity. Sure enough, our poet's room did not disappoint us. Let's see 丨the floor in the room was dug up in two large pieces, planted with two oleander bushes. The oleanders could not receive rain and dew in the room and were withered; yes, only withering is poetic. There is no table or chair in the room. The only piece of furniture is a short and long plank bed, which is what supports my poet's body every night. The floor is piled with books and paper, and the old maid has tried several times to move them out, but the poet has stopped her. I picked up a copy of Xue Lai's Selected Poems from the ground and opened it. I couldn't read it at all! It turned out that these precious poems had become the dance floor for bedbugs. Looking at the white walls again, they were full of the poet's masterpieces, the most touching of which were the two lines "Mary and I, traveling to Dedicate." The old maid asked me! "What exactly does this gentleman do?" I told her very honestly; "He is a poet." "Corpse man"? The old maid didn't understand.</p>
<h3>World Small Chronicles</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Not only women but also many men love to use cosmetics such as perfume and soap. For example, former British King George IV spent 700 pounds a year on cosmetics. If calculated at the current market price, it amounts to as much as 2,000 pounds.</p>
<p>In Maine, USA, there is a Hill family. The children are all seven in number. Mr. Hill's father was one of seven children and also had seven sons. Mr. Hill is one of them. After marrying his wife, he also successively had seven sons. The eldest son has long been married and has also had seven sons.</p>
<p>Men, women, and children throughout England love sweets. According to the statistics for the most recent year, it reached as much as 750 million pounds. If the population is taken as a proportion, the average person eats 17 pounds per year. ▲There are several old shops in London. There are 650 that are more than 100 years old. There are also several that are even older and have hundreds of years of history.</p>
<h3>Strange Taste</h3>
<p>— Yang Yixiao</p>
<p>Huai'an cattail shoots and eel are available in all seasons. Cattail shoots are produced in Huai'an Shaohu Lake. Those who work in this industry on Lianhua Street are lined up like the teeth of a comb. The taste is the freshest and most tender. It is suitable for both meat and vegetarian dishes. Eel produced in the fields is said to be the best. Huai cuisine has unique cooking methods that are beyond the reach of ordinary people. It is said that Huai chefs can make a full feast with eel. The forms and flavors are different. The so-called cattail shoots and eel are unique to Jianghuai.</p>
<p>Jinan cuisine has pre-rain shrimp kernels, which taste excellent. The method is to use a bowl of raw shrimp meat, and another egg, remove the yolk and use the white. Beat it thoroughly. Take a handful of pre-rain tea leaves and mix them evenly with the shrimp kernels, so that they can be separated individually to a suitable degree. Add a little salt. Heat the lard wok. When the oil is boiling, use a colander to hold the shrimp kernels evenly. Put them into the wok and stir-fry two or three times, then remove them. The tea leaves have already been released, with a clear fragrance and sweetness, and are quite flavorful.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from Wuxia</h3>
<p>— Kill</p>
<p>The flower affairs in Jinchang have long been known for their allure. Although they suffered a blow during the Qingbai transition, it wasn't long before those who asked about the wailing of the people once again filled the hotels. However, at a time when all industries are declining, the life among the flowers is also very bleak. Now, times create heroes. These roadside willows and wallflowers have all taken advantage of the east wind and flown to other branches. Tens of thousands of gold bells are protecting them as they leave as mistresses. Even those who remain have seen their prices soar, no longer waiting to be sold without anyone caring as they once were.</p>
<p>The Nineteenth Route Army's resistance against Japan is the key to the survival of our Republic of China. All Chinese citizens should share the enemy's hatred and unite in providing assistance to fight for the survival of the nation. However, when the Nineteenth Route Army shed blood in Shanghai, the funds collected by our Wuhou Fang Service Group in Wujun, a city of 300,000 residents, to assist the soldiers at the front only amounted to more than 6,000 gold, while the losses suffered by those who fled to other places and were robbed by lake bandits often exceeded 10,000 gold. The lack of national consciousness among our people and the self-preservation of the wealthy are truly enough to make those with a heart cry and sigh.</p>
<h3>On Thrift and Frugality to Save the Nation (8)</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Nie Zengjifen, Written by His Son Qijie</p>
<p>Modern people like to show off their own opinions, confusing right and wrong. Most people use their ears as eyes and cannot make choices. As a result, they despise etiquette and destroy sacred words, feeling pleased with themselves. This has created today's phenomenon of poverty, chaos, danger, and urgency. Who knows that all the disputes in the world have been personally experienced and studied by ancient philosophers? From the effects of their actions, they issued accurate conclusions. Following these conclusions will solve all economic problems and class disputes. Judging by the latest theories of socialism, they are mostly suitable, and the more the world evolves, the more their appropriateness becomes apparent. However, this is beyond the scope of this article, so I will not discuss it in detail. I only want to contribute my personal experiences and lessons to those who are responsible for guiding society in this era, hoping that they will give it serious consideration. If a large number of prominent figures set an example, turn the tide, not lightly regard national customs and value European customs, and practice what Dayu and other famous sages who built the nation in ancient times did, which is to hate fine clothing, meager food, and humble palaces, promote simple and crude domestic products, and collectively regard the use of luxurious, exquisite, and convenient imported goods as shameful, the effect can be seen immediately in the blink of an eye. However, in today's society, women have a greater influence on trends than men, and their responsibility is even greater. Therefore, I especially hope that our women can see this first. Wives encourage their husbands, mothers encourage their sons, and sisters encourage their brothers, all sacrificing their personal desires and working together to save the nation with thrift and frugality, to save the people, to not deceive the crowd and to be harmonious with the masses. If we can achieve this within five years, national defense will be secure. National defense is not just about strong walls, deep moats, and sharp weapons. Guanzi said, "Etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a nation. If the four pillars are not upheld, the nation will perish." Mencius said that a city with high walls, deep moats, strong soldiers, and sharp armor will be abandoned if the four pillars are not upheld. The late Duke Wen said, "I am not deeply worried about the lack of soldiers, and I do not cry bitterly about the lack of rations." But looking at this world, it is impossible to quickly find someone who does not prioritize personal gain, who fears to be behind in upholding righteousness, and who has unwavering loyalty and indignation. This is truly something to sigh about.</p>
<p>The day of national demise is not far off.</p>
<p>The memorial service for the martyrs and compatriots who died in the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War was held in Wuxia. Contemporary great men arrived one after another. The order of the meeting place was maintained by soldiers of the Sixtieth Division and the Sea Scouts. The security was strict. The park and the public sports ground were completely designated as special security zones. Anyone who was not a soldier, policeman, or had a guest pass was not allowed to stop and visit. When the great men entered the meeting place, they were welcomed into the city by horse-drawn carriages hired by the meeting. For a time, the vehicles on May 30th Road were lined up, creating a strange sight. In the past, Li Hanqiu of Jiangdu wrote the novel "Guangling Tide," which had a section about horse-drawn carriages entering the city to the Yuanmiao Temple. Readers criticized him for not being familiar with the situation in Wuxia. Now, Li's prediction has become a reality. If he knew in the afterlife, he would boast of being a prophet.</p>
<p>The mourning couplets and sacrifices sent from various places to the memorial service for the martyrs and compatriots who died in the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War were piled up like mountains. Among them, the wax-made wreath sent by the Northeastern soldiers was colorful and eye-catching. The two rifles and one bomb seized from the Japanese invaders, presented by all the soldiers of a certain division, were made into the most unique flower screen. On the day of the meeting, the mourning couplets were hung all around the meeting place and the park, and the eyes were filled with white. There were many touching words among them. This day of mourning may slightly comfort the heroic souls of the martyrs. However, the Northeast has fallen, and Liaoji has not been recovered. The restoration of the homeland still depends on the soldiers who have not died, following the blood path of the martyrs to advance.</p>
<h3>The Jinan University After the War</h3>
<p>— Xu Benxi</p>
<p>Among the universities destroyed in the war zone, Jinan University is truly one of the luckiest. Although a part of the Science Museum was bombed,</p>
<p>it is said that the internal belongings have been transported away by the traitor Shen Songge. When the enemy troops left, they inevitably buried some dangerous objects. To prevent danger, no one is allowed to enter, and it must be inspected by experts before it is opened. Unable to enter, only looking from the gaps in the trees at the poetic Lian Tao Hall, we know how haggard and frustrated it is? Undoubtedly, the romance of the past has all flowed away.</p>
<p>A bomb weighing two hundred and fifty pounds did not hit General Cai, nor did it hit the tall Western-style building. Only a few small houses that would have collapsed even without being bombed were turned into ruins.</p>
<p>Three freight cars were also bombed beyond recognition and are still parked on the tracks. From the factual report, we know that sixteen loyal and brave soldiers who defended the country and seven war horses lost their lives in these freight cars. Even now, even now, staring blankly at Jinan University, we only do not see these bodies,</p>

<p>Chapter Nine: A Fictitious Alarm of Being Evicted on a Special Train, Sitting in a Cold Government Office Turns into a Distant Fantasy</p>
<p>When An Yutian saw Xiao Mao, it was like seeing a relative in times of distress. He was overjoyed beyond words. But when he asked about what happened last night, he was still full of anger. He replied resentfully, "Don't mention it. That fellow surnamed Guo didn't follow through and actually sent me to the guard car, where I suffered all night." As he spoke, he remembered the insults he had suffered and stopped himself from saying more, fearing he would lose face if he told the whole story. He changed the subject and asked where the ladies were now. Mao Deshun said, "Alas, who knew that little rascal was trying to save trouble and sent you to that kind of place? That car was separated by seven or eight cars. No wonder I couldn't find you. Now the Fifth Madam has returned to the yamen. Your Madam is worried and is still waiting in the waiting room, waiting for you to move to the First Guesthouse together. We already sent a telegram from the car to reserve the rooms." After speaking, he hurriedly pulled him to the first-class waiting room. When Liang Xiaoyun suddenly saw that his spirit had declined to this extent in just one night, she couldn't help but ask him in detail. He repeatedly shook his head and sighed, only saying that it was not too late to talk about it at the hotel. After Mao Deshun sent them to the First Guesthouse and took his leave, he told Liang Xiaoyun the whole story in detail, and even complained that she hadn't sent someone to look for him everywhere when he got on the train. Liang Xiaoyun clicked her tongue and only laughed, "How dare you? A dignified man, traveling with his wife, and I have to take care of and bring all the luggage and servants for you. You don't care about anything and still complain that I don't take care of you. Are you still three or two years old, and do I have to hold you in my arms? Learn a lesson from this. It's your own fault for being so inexperienced.</p>
<p>You just followed people in a daze without even turning back to tell me first. That's why you made such a big joke. I advise you to discuss things with me before you do anything in the future. Don't be so reckless. There are many things you don't understand in this officialdom." An Yutian, having been taught this lesson, also realized that it was his own fault and didn't say much more. He didn't expect that after staying in this hotel, he received a call from Mao Deshun that night, saying that Military Governor Ye had set off again to inspect troops elsewhere and would not be back for three to five days, telling them to wait patiently. From then on, An Yutian waited quietly, but Liang Xiaoyun was called by the Fifth Madam every day, either by phone or by sending someone to pick her up at the yamen to play, leaving An Yutian alone in the hotel during the day feeling very lonely. On the sixth day, Liang Xiaoyun actually played mahjong in the yamen all night and didn't return. An Yutian heard everyone in the hotel spreading the word that Military Governor Ye had returned.</p>

<p>Memorial Text The memorial meeting for the fallen soldiers of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War was held in Suzhou on May 28th. All circles in Shanghai believe that Songhu is the place where the generals and soldiers died for their country, and there were also many civilian casualties. A grand commemoration must be held. Therefore, it is scheduled to hold another memorial meeting in Shanghai on the 12th of this month. We respectfully offer incense, flowers, fresh fruits, and sacrifices to the fallen generals and soldiers and the deceased compatriots, saying: Alas, the powerful neighbor started the war, affecting the Shanghai region. The generals and soldiers defended the country with unwavering loyalty. The lone army defended bitterly for nearly forty days. The bravery in battle and the frequency of casualties are shining brightly in the rivers and mountains, and the righteousness moves ghosts and gods. The enemy soldiers raged, more than the violent Qin. Where the swords and arrows pointed, it spread to the civilians. Sand worms and cranes all shared this destruction. More than three months have passed, and the blood stains are still fresh. The affairs of the time, life is like a grain of dust. Where great righteousness lies, bones are shattered. The spirit of the Chinese nation has been slightly extended. The enemy's fear has been suppressed, and a temporary peace has been achieved. The army is withdrawn and the armor is stored. We, the survivors, are filled with mixed feelings. We offer raw sacrifices and recommend兕觥 (兕觥 a bronze wine vessel), not to seek blessings, but to comfort the elite spirits. Alas, in the white mountains and black waters, the enemy cavalry is rampant. Killing fills the fields, bones are broken, and hearts are shocked. Whose millet porridge is offered to the bones in the wilderness? Comparing this to that, we are all ordinary people. Heaven, how cruel, hot tears fill our eyes. Alas, in the coming great calamity, the nation and the society will collapse. The people are still in a drunken stupor. The officials who built the节 (節 segment/knot/festival) are still engaged in internal strife. The loyal souls and their blood cannot comfort the nine springs. May we, the people, work hard for the future. On this day next year, we will offer sacrifices again. Accept the offering.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong's Eulogy Army Commander Zhang Zhizhong of the 5th Army of the National Revolutionary Army, leading all the officers and soldiers, says in his eulogy: On June 12th, the 21st year of the Republic of China, all circles in Shanghai held a memorial meeting for the fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. We respectfully offer this eulogy: The Japanese pirates are stupid and foolish, the moths of justice, plotting to seize our Liaoning and coveting our Shanghai. Relying on our soldiers and civilians, united as one, we cooperated in resisting and did not avoid sacrifice. Blood dyed Jiangwan, corpses filled the Huangpu River. Our spirit penetrates the sun and moon, our voice shakes the universe. Fragrant flowers and fine wine, we cry and mourn for the fallen. Our martyrs are the light of the nation.</p>
<p>Dai Ji's Memorial Text Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji offers a memorial text, saying: On June 12th, the 21st year of the Republic of China, Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji respectfully offers clear wine and fresh flowers to the spirits of the fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, saying: The夷 (夷 ancient barbarian) people have been our enemies for generations, taking advantage of our荒祲 (荒祲 famine), their poisonous claws flow rampantly. On September 18th, they attacked Shenyang, changing the color of our territory, and our golden 瓯 (瓯 earthenware cup) was not completed. After a year of aggression and plunder, the world is worried. On January 28th, Zhabei was trampled upon, our territory and our land, witnessed by the world. If there is no battle, the nation will die. Alas, our officers and soldiers, pierced chests and broken heads, blood and flesh, and sharp weapons, incomparable sincerity. The strong changed their vision, and the alleys began to sing. The tragic compatriots were murdered, their houses were burned, and their lives were lost. The widows, orphans, and children were displaced and could not be gathered. The old and weak filled the gullies, and the young and strong shared their hatred. Neighborhood assistance in the war, carrying millet and helping with oars, the grey heads rose like clouds, and the Han banners rose like the wind. The poor and the snow, and the spears and halberds of the sea, the united will formed a city, and the righteous and courageous banners marched. It was not only military power, but also the reliance on the people's wisdom. Iron or blood, ten thousand years and a thousand autumns. Alas, alas, accept the offering.</p>
<p>Meeting Declaration The meeting printed a declaration yesterday, which will be distributed to the representatives attending the meeting today. The text reads: Today we are holding this memorial meeting for the fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. We truly have unspeakable grief and pain. "Our magnificent Chinese nation is not respected by the great powers, and our dignified people are treated lightly by foreign races." This has been the case for a long time. In recent times, the imperialists have intensified their efforts, especially Japanese hegemony, destroying the integrity of our territory and killing our innocent compatriots. One after another, events like the May 30th Incident, disregarding humanity and justice, relying on the precision of their cannons, and carrying out the atrocities of beasts. Wherever their iron hooves reached, the sky became dark. Now, the flames of the September 18th Incident have not yet been extinguished, and the disaster of January 28th has come again. It is hair-raising to speak of. Alas, our Chinese nation has suffered a hundred years of double oppression. The nation's vitality has reached its extreme point. Although it is said that the National Revolution has been successful, and that saving the country through the Party has achieved its goal, we have found that internal affairs are not easily sorted out, and revolutionary construction cannot be discussed. Moreover, there are shameless warlords, indulging in wine and sex, putting the duty of resisting foreign enemies and defending the country out of their minds. There is no way to cover up their shame of non-resistance. They borrow the beautiful name of "bearing humiliation and bearing responsibility" or "whole resistance" to unload their guilt. Wood rots and then worms are born. If our own spirit is like this, how can we expect Japan, which has been eyeing us for a long time, to restrain its ambition? The people have the heart to save the country, but lack the means to die for it. Although they loudly call for and advocate resistance against Japan, the environment is so restrictive that they can only be angry and speechless. Therefore, the government authorities have been making all kinds of concessions, hoping to gain the final pity of the imperialists who are waiting to kill. Anti-Japanese patriotic groups have been closed down, and the movement to boycott enemy goods has been virtually canceled. But Japan, whose arrow is on the string and cannot be held back, is still not satisfied. After claiming to be satisfied, they immediately follow up with bombings by airplanes and cannons. It goes without saying that such barbaric acts lack humanity and justice, and simply despise the national integrity of our Republic of China. Their attitude is as insulting as a violent husband towards a weak wife, making her laugh and cry, according to their whims. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army did not disgrace the duty of soldiers, and was not afraid of the Japanese bandits. They were determined to sacrifice themselves and resist to the end, even if the last bullet was fired. With an iron spirit, they stood firm on the mountain of corpses and in the sea of blood, never changing their original intention. As soon as the righteous banner was raised, the people rejoiced. The Fifth Army also loved the country and did not dare to lag behind, rising up to fight together and share the difficulties. The officers and soldiers fought desperately on the front lines, and the people assisted in the rear, and finally achieved the effect of repelling the enemy. After holding out for thirty-four days, the Japanese imperialists, even with their superior cannons and soldiers, not only failed to gain the slightest advantage, but also suffered heavy casualties and losses. And our brave soldiers, who sacrificed for the nation, for the country, for justice, and for righteousness, are countless. At this time, the violent Japanese, unable to win in military terms, were furious and carried out a great massacre, killing our good compatriots and burning our homes. Bones and flesh were scattered everywhere, and ruins were everywhere. The pain was so great that it could not be added to. Thinking of our dead compatriots, although they are not as great in merit as the fallen soldiers, the cruelty of the imperialists is thus more clearly revealed, making the survivors more determined to rise up and resist Japan, and this also has its own meaning. Now the ceasefire agreement has been signed on the bed, and the invading Japanese soldiers have said that they will withdraw and return to their country.</p>
<p>The talk of a round table conference is now being lobbied for by the Japanese side. Although the Japanese government has its own overall plan and the Japanese people have their own dreams, we remember the January 28th Resistance, the intense and tragic morale, the hot-blooded surge of the people, and the result is only remaining corpses and bones exposed on the battlefield, broken buildings and ruins piled up in Songhu, economic devastation, millions of unemployed, and a broken society that cannot be reversed. How can those who have not died not be in deep pain and sorrow multiplied? And our fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots, if they knew in the afterlife, would surely have their hair standing on end and their eyes cracking, and they would cry bitterly. Our empty words of remembrance are of no help. We must quickly awaken ourselves, shoulder the unfinished heavy responsibility of the dead, and urge the government to unite as one, not to be subdued by force, not to be tempted by profit, and continue to resist Japan to the death. Only in this way can we live up to the meaning of today's memorial service, and stand before the spirits of the great fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots without shame. In addition to grief, the conference cannot express all of its intentions, and it humbly recounts them, and hereby informs our compatriots from all walks of life. (New Voice Society)</p>
<p>Propaganda Outline (1) The January 28th Shanghai Incident and the September 18th Northeast Incident are both consistent traditional policies of Japanese imperialism's invasion of China. (2) The withdrawal of Japanese soldiers back to their country is a diplomatic strategy. The Japanese had already indicated at the League of Nations that "the Shanghai Incident can be conceded, but the Northeast Incident should not be interfered with by a third party." This shows that it is not a sincere expression of peace. The withdrawal of troops from Shanghai is only to ease the international atmosphere and to facilitate the thorough success of the Northeast invasion. (3) The responsibility for the Shanghai Incident should be borne by Japan. The Chinese side has always maintained calm, even canceling anti-Japanese groups, in order to seek peace. Unexpectedly, the Japanese attacked that night after claiming to be satisfied, causing the destruction of Shanghai, where world commerce gathers. How can the Japanese be allowed to shirk their responsibility? (4) The Japanese soldiers in Shanghai have not yet been completely withdrawn, and the voice of the free city is becoming more and more audible. Although this is a dream of the Japanese, Japan, which is good at seduction, will surely do its best to incite various countries. The future is truly worrying. This shows that Japan's ceasefire is not sincere. We should expose their ambitions and warn our people to pay attention and prevent them at all times. (5) The fact that Shanghai did not become the Northeast this time is entirely the price paid by the 19th Route Army's heavy sacrifices. From this, we know more about the absurdity of the non-resistance policy. The first way out for the Chinese people from now on is to seek it through unity and continued resistance. (6) From the suffering of the deceased compatriots, we have a deeper understanding of the ferocity and cruelty of Japanese imperialism. We should strive to strengthen the country and fight them to the death in order to save the nation from its critical plight. (7) In mourning the fallen soldiers, we should urge the government to implement resistance and revolutionary diplomacy to fulfill the anti-Japanese aspirations of the dead, and to commend and comfort their merits and their surviving families in order to inspire the loyalty and bravery of the surviving soldiers. (8) The death of the deceased compatriots is due to the poverty and weakness of the country. We should also urge the government and all circles to find ways to appease their surviving families in order to comfort the dead and maintain the people's hearts. (9) After the January 28th Incident, the war zones have all become desolate ruins. The affected areas of Nanshi and the concessions have also suffered considerable losses. We should urge the government and all circles to find ways to remedy the situation and reverse the calamity in one out of ten thousand cases. (10) As for implementing economic severance, promoting domestic goods, and boycotting Japanese goods, this is especially an urgent task. Our people should practice what they preach and not neglect it. (11) When we mourn the fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots, it is not enough to simply observe three minutes of silence for the dead, send a few wreaths, and hang a few mourning couplets. We should never forget their death, the reason for their death, and continue their legacy and their unfinished work.

<h3>Special Martial Law Today</h3>
<p>Due to No Meeting Allowed at Public Sports Field</p>
<p>Iron Gates at the Border Between Chinese and Concessions Temporarily Closed</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Association Against the Ceasefire Agreement and Supporting the Northeast Volunteer Army originally scheduled to convene a memorial meeting for Gu Zhenghong and the martyrs who died in the anti-Japanese war on "May 30th." However, due to special martial law imposed by the Chinese and Concession authorities and traffic obstruction, the meeting was postponed to the 5th. Later, in order to expand the scope, it was changed again to 10:00 AM today at the West Gate Public Sports Field to hold a memorial meeting for the martyrs who died in the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast and Songhu. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, on the grounds that the meeting had not been approved and that it was during a period of martial law, how could it hold a meeting without authorization, ordered its subordinates to ban it. It also declared special martial law today. The police brigades, sections, and substations in all districts were all armed and deployed. Double posts were stationed at all important roads, and patrols were stepped up. The Public Concession and French Concession police departments were also ordered to be on high alert. The iron gates at the border between the Chinese and concessions were all closed, leaving only one or two small doors to allow vehicles to pass. Chinese and Western detectives were also increased.</p>
<p>Checking pedestrians at the border, and the People's Association Against the Ceasefire Agreement and Supporting the Northeast Volunteer Army erected a platform on the stage at the West Gate Public Sports Field yesterday morning in preparation for today's meeting. After receiving the report, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, on the grounds that the meeting was being held during martial law, ordered the police to</p>
<p>Remove the platform, and the doors and windows on all four sides of the public sports field were closed, prohibiting the meeting from being held.</p>

<h3>Third Fleet Leaves Shanghai</h3>
<p>Nomura, Shiozawa, Uematsu, etc.</p>
<p>Returned Home Yesterday on the Izumo Battleship</p>
<p>The Second Fleet of the Japanese Navy, which was transferred to Shanghai on February 3rd, has been there for more than four months. It was not until yesterday that it finally set sail and returned home. Nomura, Shiozawa, Uematsu, Shimada, etc., also boarded the</p>
<p>Izumo battleship to return home. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Flagship Sets Sail After arriving in Shanghai on February 3rd, the flagship Izumo of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet was stationed in front of the Japanese Consulate, commonly known as the Mitsubishi Wharf. An electric網 (網 net/web) was set up around the hull of the ship. At 5:00 AM yesterday, it received Nomura's order to move from in front of the Mitsubishi Wharf to moor in front of the Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu. The military equipment and supplies belonging to the Third Fleet, which were stored in various warehouses in Yangshupu, were then moved onto the ship. The light cruiser Tokiwa was also re-moored there. At 12:40 PM, it began to leave Shanghai.</p>
<p>Nomura Boards Ship Third Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Nomura, accompanied by the newly appointed Director of the Naval Education Bureau, Rear Admiral Shiozawa, and the outgoing Commander of the Marines, Uematsu, as well as Third Fleet Staff Officer Rear Admiral Shimada, etc., arrived at the wharf by car at about 12:00 PM. The Marines then dispatched a team of soldiers led by Major Ota to set up guard posts in the wharf area, not allowing pedestrians to stop and watch.</p>
<p>Japanese Nationals See Off Those who went to the wharf to see off included the newly appointed Commander of the Japanese Navy's Shanghai Special Marine Corps, Rear Admiral Sugi 板 (杉板 cedar plank), Samejima, Kitaoka, two staff officers, the leader of the Chamber of Commerce, Miri, a representative of the textile industry, Funatsu, and various representatives of Japanese nationals, totaling more than 200 people. There were farewell flags written on the wharf, and a team of elementary school students also went to the wharf to see them off. At 12:40 PM, the Izumo finally carried the military officers away from Shanghai and returned home.</p>
<p>Farewell Remarks Nomura delivered farewell remarks to those seeing him off on the Izumo, saying that he was injured during the 天長節 (Emperor's Birthday celebration) and thought he would secretly die in the hospital. Now he is fortunate to have fully recovered, and today he is leaving Shanghai and returning home. He hopes that the Shanghai people will work harder to achieve peace in East Asia, and so on.</p>
<p>Existing Japanese Warships The Japanese warships on the Yangtze River during the war and the Japanese warships in Shanghai were almost united as one. At most, there were 65 ships. The ships in Shanghai are now gradually withdrawing. There are still 15 teams of four torpedoes, which can also set sail tomorrow. From today onwards, the Japanese warships in Shanghai will still belong to the First Foreign Dispatch Team of the Yangtze River, but in reality, there are six more ships than before January 28th.</p>

<h3>Withdraw Completely in the Shortest Possible Time</h3>
<p>Japanese Committee Member Okazaki Formally Replied Yesterday</p>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency said that regarding the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, Mr. Yu Hongjun, a member of our side of the Joint Committee, has made serious representations to Japanese Committee Member Katsuo Okazaki on several occasions. The Japanese side stated that the commander of the Special Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai was in the process of transition between the old and the new, and a formal reply could only be given to our side after the handover procedures were completed on the 11th. At 11:50 AM yesterday, Japanese Committee Member Okazaki formally visited Secretary-General Yu at the Municipal Government as agreed to reply to this question. According to the Japanese Committee, the procedures for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops have been negotiated with Colonel Sugiita, the new commander of the Japanese Marines, and it has been decided to withdraw completely within a few days. However, because the number of Japanese troops currently stationed in Shanghai is greater than before the war, the original garrison locations in the concession are not enough to accommodate them. In the short term, it is still necessary to negotiate garrison locations with the concession authorities. Therefore, the withdrawal date has not yet been determined. However, the Japanese side sincerely hopes that this difficulty can be resolved as soon as possible in the shortest possible time, so that the withdrawal procedures will not be delayed. On the one hand, it also deeply hopes that our country's authorities will understand. After listening to Yu's remarks, he said that although what the Japanese Committee said was for other reasons, according to the spirit of the agreement, those Japanese troops could no longer remain stationed. Moreover, rumors have been rampant in recent days, causing uneasiness among Chinese and foreign residents. Therefore, he still firmly demanded that the Japanese side withdraw immediately and should quickly set a withdrawal date. The Japanese Committee immediately expressed acceptance. The talks lasted for 30 minutes before he left.</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency said that Secretary Lang of the Joint Committee told the reporter of the Xinsheng News Agency in a telephone call the other day that the issue of the complete withdrawal of the Japanese Navy will have new</p>
<p>Developments on the 13th (Monday). At the same time, the Public Concession will begin to lift martial law. At that time, the phone was buzzing, and it was mistaken for a formal reply on the 13th. I will correct it in this order.</p>
<p>Japanese Commander Visits Mayor Wu Colonel Sugiita, commander of the Japanese Navy's Shanghai Special Marine Corps, accompanied by Bai Jinglian, Deputy Consul of the Japanese Consulate, and Kamata Masakazu, Adjutant of the Marine Corps Staff, formally visited Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Public Security Director Wen Yingxing at the Municipal Government at 11:00 AM yesterday, since the handover procedures have been completed. Wu and Wen received them, and Mr. Ban Rugeng, a member of our Municipal Government, served as the interpreter, and Shirai Yasushi served as the interpreter for the Japanese side.</p>
<p>The two sides had a茗談 (茗談 literally "tea talk," meaning informal conversation) for about half an hour before leaving.</p>
<p>Japanese Navy's Actions in West Shanghai According to Liu Yunfang, the director of the second section of the sixth district, the Municipal Public Security Bureau reported yesterday that at about 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, according to Liu Gancheng, the police chief of the Hongqiao police station, a truck carrying about 20 Japanese soldiers drove out of the 同文書院 (Tongwen College) and left. At 9:20, a military vehicle carrying more than 10 Japanese soldiers and military supplies came to the 同文書院 (Tongwen College). It was not until 9:30 that they left. At 11:00 and 12:00, there were two military vehicles, carrying about 30 Japanese soldiers in total, to the hospital. Most of the above-mentioned Japanese soldiers were stationed in the Chinese Ministry. Every night, three or five Marines from the Marine Corps stationed in the ministry would pass through Hongqiao Road, Triumphal Road, and Columbia Road, patrolling back and forth. Also, the old students of the Chinese Ministry, which was formerly located in the Chinese Ministry, have now been merged and attend classes with Japanese students as usual, without any significant actions.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Speech</h3>
<p>No Debts Incurred Since April</p>
<p>Revenue and Expenditure Perfectly Balanced</p>
<p>My Energy and Strength Exhausted</p>
<p>Difficult to Shoulder the Heavy Responsibility of Finance Again</p>
<p>After submitting his resignation, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen remained silent for almost a week. Yesterday, he suddenly released a statement worthy of attention. We hereby record it as follows:</p>
<p>Over the past year, I have been unfortunately beset by both public and private affairs. Therefore, at the end of the year, I resigned and went to Hangzhou for recuperation. However, with the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, the powerful neighbor pressing in, and the atmosphere of war escalating, I felt that the overall situation was critical and that every man had a responsibility. Disregarding everything, I rushed to Nanjing day and night to reassume the position of Minister of Finance. At that time, the national treasury was extremely empty, while military salaries and expenses were urgently needed. Amidst internal and external troubles, I devised various plans, hoping to restore public confidence in the government on the one hand, and secure resources for resisting the enemy on the other. At the same time, it was also necessary to consider the stability of the market and finance. Therefore, on the day of my reinstatement, I immediately began to reorganize government bonds, aiming to ensure that the credit of the bonds would not decline and would be further guaranteed, while also reducing the government's monthly debt burden. Fortunately, bondholders at that time were deeply aware of the greater good, and the reorganization plan was successfully completed. Those provinces that had been intercepting national taxes were strictly ordered to remit them to the central government, and military and administrative expenses were actively reduced. The national order was gradually restored to its former state. Although in recent months, first the Japanese army invaded Shanghai with continuous flames of war, and then the truce agreement was on the verge of collapse, the government has always been diligent and self-disciplined, following a policy of austerity and proceeding painfully. Therefore, in the recent month of April, the government did not incur a single debt, and revenue and expenditure were able to be balanced, which is something I am extremely gratified about. During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, banks and financial institutions in Shanghai were constantly in turmoil. Being located in Shanghai, it was even necessary to lend large sums to the government. I knew that once the market's confidence was lost, the national finance would collapse, and the country would be doomed. Now that the Shanghai incident has come to an end, my energy and strength are exhausted, and I am truly unable to shoulder the heavy responsibility of finance again. From what I have observed, the future financial difficulties may be even greater than they are today, though perhaps not as urgent as in the past few months. This is because the expenditure on military and administrative expenses will likely increase rather than decrease. However, even if administrative expenses increase slightly, it will not be difficult to raise funds. The suppression of the Communist bandits is currently the most pressing problem. If the Communist bandits are not eliminated for a single day, the foundation of the country will not be solid for a single day. The government's only major responsibility is to thoroughly eliminate the Communist bandits in the Yangtze River basin. Now that Chairman Jiang has been entrusted with this responsibility, it can be said that the right person has been chosen. Mr. Jiang is courageous in taking on responsibilities, and we deeply hope that he will persevere and achieve the goal of complete elimination. Since April, the government has made various efforts to economize and has fortunately overcome difficulties, establishing a foundation for balanced income and expenditure. Future construction projects can therefore have a foothold. I am extremely gratified in my heart. However, looking around the country, there are widespread scenes of suffering, with disasters affecting all industries and millions of rural villages being almost completely ravaged by the Communist bandits. In addition, the strong neighbor has invaded, and the wounds have not yet healed. How can we further increase taxes and inflict more suffering on our people? Although in recent weeks, national tax revenues have exceeded my expectations and have not decreased significantly, there is a principle in economics called the law of diminishing returns. Should those in charge of finance not pay attention to this principle during this difficult period? Since tax revenues cannot be increased, the only way is to incur debts. This is like cutting flesh to mend sores, repeating the cycle until there is no more flesh to cut. Is incurring debts any different? If the annual revenue is insufficient, then debts are incurred to make up for it. If there is no way to repay the debts, then new debts are incurred to repay them. Eventually, all the income of the national treasury is used to repay debts, and it is still not enough. I have already tasted the pain in this. In the recent month of April, thanks to various efforts to economize and the great righteousness and sacrifice of national bondholders, this terrifying cycle of the past few years was finally broken. This is a blessing for the country and also a personal fortune. No matter how much the government needs in terms of finance, I feel guilty in my heart and will never follow this evil cycle again. However, the Communist bandits are rampant and cannot be eliminated without a large army. With a large army gathered, military expenses must increase. I am ashamed of my lack of talent and have no way to respond. It is just like a difficult problem in physics: when an irresistible force advances, it suddenly encounters an immovable object. What will be the result? My situation is similar to this. For the sake of the overall situation and from a personal standpoint, I have no choice but to resign. Furthermore, can we not survive without incurring debts? When the world is hungry, vegetable roots can also satisfy hunger. Why must we eat meat porridge? It is good to increase revenue, but if there is no way to increase revenue, the only way is to reduce expenditure. The effect of reducing expenditure has already been seen. Can we not continue to do so and further innovate internally to seek a bright path? The problem of the Communist bandits is not simply a military problem, nor is it simply a political problem. Using military force to suppress the Communist bandits and using politics to pacify the people will ensure that the Communist bandits will not rise again after they are eliminated. Otherwise, they will rise up one after another, and it will be difficult to eradicate their roots. The current economic downturn has reached the world, and those who suffer from it are not only China. The key is to deal with it properly. Looking around Europe and the United States, all are advocating austerity. Countries in the East and West have already done this before us. Diligence and self-discipline are the reasons for our party's success. Because we were able to be diligent, the warlords fled at the sight of the party army, and the people welcomed us with food and drink. That is why we have today. Because we were able to be diligent, even the rampant Japanese eventually lowered their flags and retreated. What we can do today, those who come after us should also be able to do. If we are united and work hard, what do we have to fear from crossing this turbulent sea and achieving prosperity and strength? It depends on the government and the people to do well. My resignation will not affect the political situation. Although I am leaving, I feel at ease. In recent years, I have resigned several times because of the huge expenses and the lack of a magic touch to make money. However, in the end, I was unable to do so because I had not fulfilled my responsibility to the bondholders. Now, it is different. The bonds have been reorganized this time, and those who succeed me should be able to maintain the status quo without difficulty. Although I dare not say that the financial system I have implemented is perfect, the fact that I have been able to achieve a balance between income and expenditure amidst internal and external troubles without incurring a single debt in four months is a foolish idea that may be useful for those who succeed me to learn from. As for the likin tax, which has harmed the country and the people for a hundred years, and all taxes similar to the likin, which I have always hated, they have been fundamentally eradicated under the supervision and active assistance of Chairman Jiang and Mr. Hu. Also, the Central Bank, which I have managed, now has a solid foundation and stands firmly as a pillar of the national finance. Those who succeed me should be able to make good use of it.</p>

<p>Local News Two</p>
<p>Cunningham Denies</p>
<h3>Convening of Roundtable Conference</h3>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Criticizes the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reported that a representative of the Ta Kung Pao yesterday afternoon (the 10th) took a copy of a Tokyo telegram received by the Japanese United Press on the 9th to visit the American Consul General Cunningham, asking if it was true that the Japanese Foreign Ministry had received information that the Shanghai consular body would hold a meeting soon to discuss the roundtable conference. Mr. Cunningham replied that he was not aware that the consular body would hold this meeting and had not heard of this news before. However, Mr. Cunningham's words were very different from those of Iguchi, the acting Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, as reported in yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun. Iguchi said that various foreign chambers of commerce in Shanghai had requested the consular body to hold a roundtable conference in Shanghai, and the members of the consular body would hold a meeting to discuss this matter, but it was not known whether the consular body would request to convene a roundtable conference. As for the Public Works Department's plan to resolve the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries with the special committee of the Shanghai Municipal Government, yesterday's Japanese newspapers in Shanghai strongly criticized this, saying that the Public Works Department had no right to interfere in this matter and that it should be handled by the consular body or the roundtable conference.</p>
<p>Playing with Shells</p>
<h3>Three Seamstresses Tragically Die</h3>
<p>Seamstresses Pick Up a Shell on Baoshan Road</p>
<p>Forcefully Hammering, the Shell Suddenly Explodes and Bombs</p>
<p>Three Male and Female Workers Die Tragically</p>
<p>Ye Shaoyu, a Cantonese, is a red gang tailor. He set up a workshop at No. 531 Hong'an Lane, Bazilu (Targets Road), employing seamstresses Chen Guo, Wang Qian, and Liang Shengyu to make Western suits and shirts for various clothing stores. Recently, because the Dragon Boat Festival had just passed, the work was not busy, and the seamstresses had plenty of free time. Yesterday afternoon, Chen and Wang initiated a tour of the war zone to pay their respects to the broken walls and scorched earth of Baoshan Road. Walking near the Commercial Press, they picked up a shell from a pile of rubble and took it home as a souvenir. Around 7:30 p.m., after finishing their dinner, the seamstresses were chatting idly in the front wing room. Chen and Wang took out the shell they had picked up during the day to play with. At that time, in addition to Chen Guo, Wang Qian, and Liang Shengyu, there was also Ye Hongdao, the younger brother of the workshop owner Ye Shaoyu, in the room. After Chen and Wang stroked the shell for a while, they still felt unsatisfied and suddenly began to knock and peel it in order to further study it and examine the contents of the shell. In an instant, everyone in the house heard a loud crash coming from the front wing room, followed by the smell of gunpowder entering their noses. They followed the sound and rushed to the wing room to see what had happened. But the four people, Chen, Wang, Liang, and Ye, were lying horizontally and vertically on the floor. The objects in the room were in a mess, falling to the ground, and wisps of green smoke were still slowly seeping out of the cracks in the door. Soon, the Hongkou Police Station heard the news and immediately ordered the fire brigade to drive to the scene to collect the four people. Western detective Hair Hua and detective Feng Qi arrived at the scene to investigate and found that Chen Guo and Wang Qian had already died under the shell. Although Ye Xi and Liang Shengyu were not dead, they were covered in blood and flesh and were unconscious. They were sent to Tongren Hospital and Guangren Hospital for treatment respectively. At 9:15 p.m. last night, Liang Shengyu died of serious injuries. Chen Guo, the deceased, was 21 years old, and Wang Qian was also 21 years old and was of Cantonese origin. The injured Ye Hongxi had his left foot broken, and the seamstress Liang Shengyu was also injured all over her body, and their lives were in danger. The shell picked up by the seamstresses was about a foot high and looked like a thermos bottle. It was said that when the accident occurred, iron tools were used to hammer and chisel the shell, causing the explosives to be shocked and explode on the ground. The explosive power of this shell was huge. In addition to the four dead and injured, the objects, utensils, walls, and wooden boards in the room were also damaged, either destroyed or penetrated. The deaths of Chen and Wang were extremely tragic. Wang Qian's hands, feet, and limbs were all blown off, and his chest was also sunken into a hole. Chen Guo's head was destroyed and his face was torn, with blood and flesh blurred and unbearable to look at. Both bodies were sent to the coroner's office to await examination by the court. The four unfortunate seamstresses had only lived in this house for a month, as Ye Shaoyu moved into this house in mid-May. Counting on their fingers, it was only a little over thirty days.</p>
<p>Municipal Government</p>
<h3>Sends Letter Requesting the Withdrawal of British Troops</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government stated that during the Songhu War, British troops stationed in Shanghai were stationed on Bailinan Road and Kaixuan Road. Negotiations had been conducted previously, but they were dismissed as temporary measures and have not been withdrawn. Yesterday, another letter was sent to the British Consul in Shanghai, requesting their speedy withdrawal in order to strengthen friendship. The original letter is as follows: Sir, I am writing to you to inquire about the case of the deployment of your country's troops beyond the boundaries. Previously, this government sent a letter to your Consul General requesting him to forward it to stop this. Later, on February 5, your Consul General replied that it was a temporary measure and that it could be stopped when the situation permitted. Now that the Shanghai Truce Agreement has been signed and the Japanese troops are withdrawing one after another, the situation has calmed down. This government's police force is fully capable of maintaining local security. This government shall be fully responsible for the lives and property of all foreign nationals in this city. It is now found that there are still troops from your country stationed on Qiaodun Road near Columbia Road, Bailinan Road, and the west side of Kaixuan Road. We request your Consul General to forward this to the military authorities of your country to quickly withdraw the troops from the above two locations in order to respect sovereignty and strengthen friendship. We hereby send this letter and hope for your consideration and a reply. Respectfully, to John Brenan, British Consul General in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Army to Return to Philippines</h3>
<p>July 1st</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Pao reported that the 1st Battalion of the 31st Infantry Regiment of the US Army, which was transferred from the Philippines to Shanghai on February 5 after the outbreak of the Shanghai War and stationed in places such as the New World, has been here for more than four months. Because the situation in Shanghai has eased, it received a telegram from Washington last night ordering it to set sail for the Philippines on July 1. The US Army transport ship Republic will arrive in Shanghai from Tianjin on June 30, and the US troops will board the ship on that day and set sail for Manila the next day. It is said that the US Army's stationing in Shanghai was not fixed, but the army and the American community expected it to stay in Shanghai for the summer and return to the Philippines in the autumn. Therefore, this order was quite unexpected for them.</p>
<p>Concession Telephone Workers</p>
<h3>Quietly Awaiting Company's Reply</h3>
<p>Representatives of Arrested Workers Released Yesterday</p>
<p>Strike Committee Held Delegates' Congress Yesterday</p>
<p>Workers from Repair Shop and Others Join the Strike</p>
<p>After the workers of the Concession Telephone Company went on strike, the company delayed negotiations because the conditions had not yet been translated. Yesterday, workers from the Yangshupu Repair Shop, the Yidingpan Road Wiring Room, and the Fujian Road Sample Room also joined the strike, and the situation expanded. The Strike Committee convened a delegates' congress, and the unemployed workers who were laid off before May 30th also joined the unified action and put forward demands. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiations Delayed: The Strike Committee sent representatives to negotiate the conditions with the company the day before yesterday. The company said that the conditions had not yet been translated and still did not give a definite reply, causing the negotiations to stall. It is now heard that the company has completed the translation of the conditions put forward by the workers and will reply on Monday. However, the reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with worker representative Ye Gongzhao yesterday, who said that they have not yet received any notice from the company. It is now decided to strictly organize the Strike Committee and quietly await the company's reply.</p>
<p>Strike Expanded: After the workers of the Jiangxi Road Central Bank and the branch warehouse went on strike, some workers had not yet gone on strike because they had not received orders from the Strike Committee. Yesterday morning, more than 300 workers from the Yangshupu Repair Shop, the Yidingpan Road Wiring Room, and the Fujian Road Main Wiring Room and Sample Room sent representatives to contact the Strike Committee and declared that they were willing to go on strike together. They had only not implemented it because they had not received orders. The Strike Committee believed that the management had no intention of negotiating and immediately ordered the workers of the above lines to go on strike immediately. Therefore, yesterday morning, the strike was implemented, and representatives were sent to participate in the Strike Committee.</p>
<p>Arrested Released: When the striking workers held a congress in front of the new Central Bank on Fujian Road the day before yesterday, the patrolmen arrested the worker representative Ye Gongzhao and the workers Wan Ruichun, Zhang Rongsheng, and Zhu Ziwen for disturbing the peace by shouting slogans. They were completely released yesterday. When Ye Gongzhao and others left the patrol station, the workers of the new Central Bank on Fujian Road held a special welcoming meeting and unanimously decided to fight to the end. It is also heard that the five members of the struggle committee organized by the striking workers in the north line of Hainin Road who were arrested by the patrolmen at the Aiwenyi Road Tongshang Hotel the day before yesterday have been released by the patrol station.</p>
<p>Delegates' Congress: The internal organization of the striking workers this time is very strict. Before the strike, workers from each line elected representatives to organize the delegates' congress. Yesterday at 1:00 p.m., the fourth delegates' congress was convened at Luochun Pavilion, with more than 60 representatives attending. First, the chairman reported that the management had used the excuse that the conditions had not been translated to delay negotiations and at the same time had bought off labor spies to undermine the strike. Now the workers should unite more and fight to the end to seek final victory. When the meeting was held, the patrolmen came to ban it, but the worker representatives insisted on continuing the meeting and immediately resolved: (1) To improve the organization itself and expand the Strike Committee. The 15 members additionally elected by the Public Sports Ground workers' congress the day before yesterday will be added to the Strike Committee. Each line and department will immediately establish a picket team, a propaganda team, and a fundraising team and concentrate them, and under the leadership of the Strike Committee, consolidate the group organization. (2) To make the strike work more active and prevent the company's telegrams and telephone calls. (3) To expand propaganda to the outside world, request assistance from all walks of life, and send representatives to various places to request assistance from workers. (4) To receive newspaper reporters and publish the third declaration, which will be handed over to the Propaganda Department for execution. (5) To raise strike funds. It was decided to collect half a yuan from each worker and also raise funds from the outside world. (6) The external propaganda must be unified (decided to be handed over to the Propaganda Department for execution). (7) To publish a strike tabloid (to be handled by the Propaganda Department). (8) To participate in today's congress. (9) To establish a new office.</p>
<p>Meetings of Various Lines: The enlarged meeting of the Strike Committee of the Fujian Road Line was held at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, with 27 people attending. It was resolved: (1) Each striking worker should participate in the picket team, the propaganda team, the fundraising team, and other work. (2) To improve the work of each department and expand the organization of the transportation team. (3) To pass the third strike declaration. (4) To review the work of the presidium of the General Strike Committee. (5) The entire body to participate in the congress. Also, the North Line Struggle Committee held a meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, with more than 20 people attending. It was resolved: (1) All striking workers should participate in the work of various organizations of the Strike Committee. (2) To improve the group. (3) The entire body to participate in the congress. (4) To start warning the female switchboard operators about their unconscious actions and invite them to participate in the Strike Committee. (5) To establish a worker reception center. (6) To make suggestions to the delegates' congress: (1) To expand the Strike Committee. (2) To improve the work of each line, department, and group. (3) The Strike Committee's finances and work should be regularly reported to the masses. Also, the workers of the air-conditioning rooms of various lines also held a meeting yesterday, with more than 20 people attending. It was resolved: (2) To donate half a yuan each to the strike fund, which was collected at the time. (2) To participate in the congress. (3) To establish an air-conditioning worker affairs committee, electing eight members. (4) To organize a propaganda team and a picket team.</p>
<p>Worker Negotiations: In the past year or so, the Electric Company has successively dismissed more than a thousand workers. Many unemployed workers have not yet received severance pay or have only received one or two months' salary. Now some unemployed workers have put forward the idea of asking the company to reissue severance pay, uniformly six months' salary. It is heard that the striking workers agree with this proposal. Workers and staff members with monthly salaries of more than 40 yuan have also proposed to the Strike Committee that they should all increase their salaries, regardless of Chinese or foreign workers and staff members. It is heard that the Strike Committee also agrees with this proposal. It is said that these two new conditions will also appear in the strike conditions.</p>
<h3>Solution to the Electric Workers' Strike of the Chinese Merchants</h3>
<p>The Union Believes That the Board of Directors' Handling Is Satisfactory</p>
<p>All the workers of the Chinese Merchants Electric Company opposed the dismissal of ticket seller No. 71 by Zhu Shaoyi, the section chief of the car service department, posted large slogans, and drove Zhu Shaoyi away. The situation of petitioning the manager was serious, and there was a tendency to brew a strike. Now the company's board of directors has resolved to allow the resumption of work, and the workers believe that it is satisfactory. The dark clouds have cleared away in an instant. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Dispute: Zhu Shaoyi, the section chief of the car service department of the company, dismissed ticket seller No. 71 for allegedly skimming oil. All the workers believed that Zhu Shaoyi had dismissed the worker for no reason and believed that he intended to oppress them. The First District Water and Electricity Industry Union sent personnel to negotiate, but it was ineffective, leading to a tendency to brew a strike. The day before yesterday, the union specially convened a delegates' congress to discuss measures. Because it was during martial law, the Public Security Bureau dissuaded them, so the meeting was not held. The next day, they petitioned the company, requesting the company to replace Zhu Shaoyi and allow ticket seller No. 71 to resume work. The company agreed to reply after the board of directors discussed it.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Solution: The Chinese Merchants Electric Company held a board of directors meeting yesterday. Regarding the dismissal of ticket seller No. 71 by Zhu Shaoyi, the section chief of the car service department, after the standing directors reviewed it, they submitted it for discussion. They all believed that Zhu Shaoyi's handling was inappropriate, and the service of ticket seller No. 71 was not without negligence. They should be given appropriate punishment separately. Ticket seller No. 71 should still be allowed to resume work, and the salary during the suspension of work should be paid as usual. The rest of the case will be continued to be investigated and handled by the board of directors. It is heard that the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union believes that the board of directors' handling is satisfactory, so the strike was eliminated without a trace.</p>
<p>Land, Finance, Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus</p>
<h3>Consulted Yesterday on the Revitalization of the City Center Area</h3>
<p>Promote the Establishment of a Fund Management Committee</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the revitalization of the city center area, Secretary-General Yu was ordered to convene the directors of the Land, Finance, Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus to a meeting at the Municipal Government at 10:30 a.m. yesterday. Cai Zengji, Director of the Finance Bureau, Jin Liren, Director of the Land Bureau, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Shen Yi, Director of the Works Bureau, all attended. Secretary-General Yu chaired the meeting. First, the directors reported on the progress of the construction of the municipal government houses and local engineering projects. Then, the discussion began. As a result of the discussion, in addition to the city center area plan, which must still be actively carried out, the establishment of the City Center Area Fund Management Committee should be urged to be established as soon as possible. This will not only make the project actively proceed but also make the foundation of the city center area more and more solid. The candidates for the Fund Management Committee will be elected by the landholders to show caution. It is heard that the total amount of the fund, including the first phase of the project, is about 3 million yuan. Since the January 28th Incident, although the municipal government's finances have been extremely strained, not a single penny of this fund has been used.</p>
<p>Huang Bingheng Sent Personnel to Shanghai</p>
<p>To Negotiate the Formation of the Aviation National Salvation Association</p>
<p>Huang Bingheng, Director of the Aviation Administration, believes that national defense is weak and aviation is very immature, and it seems necessary to actively expand and promote it. After the end of the Shanghai War, Huang initiated the organization of the Aviation National Salvation Association to unite all sectors of the country to pay attention to the issue of aviation national salvation. It is learned that Huang specially sent Lin Wojiang to Shanghai to contact various sectors of Shanghai to initiate the organization of the association and solicit opinions from the banking community. It is heard that the result is that because of the painful experience of our country being ravaged by enemy planes during this Shanghai War, all are willing to promote Huang's move to realize it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Issued by the United Reserve Committee</p>
<h3>Public Bill, Treasury Bill, and Mortgage Bill</h3>
<p>After the member banks of the Shanghai United Reserve Committee successively paid up their reserve assets, they have issued the three types of bills, namely public bills, treasury bills, and mortgage bills. These reserve assets have been accurately reviewed by experts and then strictly evaluated, so the guarantee of the bills is extremely solid. For the public bill item, the committee has raised sufficient funds for payment. In addition to the original receiving bank holding it to borrow funds from the committee, if it is issued by the bank, it can be used in the market to fully replace cash. The committee is responsible for paying the bill holder immediately upon sight of the bill and redeeming it in full at any time. This kind of circulating securities is still a new creation in the market. After it is used, not only can the funds between banks become more active, but the exquisite printing, convenient delivery, and solid credit should be welcomed by the commercial sector. As for treasury bills and mortgage bills, their circulation is limited to banks. This newspaper has specially obtained a sample of public bills and treasury bills from the committee (the design of the mortgage bill is roughly the same as that of the treasury bill) and shrunk them to the left to provide to readers.</p>

<p>French Consulate Welcomed Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Pao reported that Vice Admiral Pierre-Alexis Ronarc'h, the new commander of the French fleet in China, arrived in Shanghai on the cruiser Primauguet yesterday afternoon (the 10th) and docked in the Huangpu River in front of the Jiangnan Shipyard.

<p>British Candy Store as a Gift</p>
<h3>Donation to Shanghai War Zone Children</h3>
<p>A message from the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Child Welfare Association states that the director of the Shanghai War Zone Orphanage and Asylum recently received a letter from the owner of Cadbarg Bros. Ltd. (a confectionery shop in London, England), stating that they were deeply saddened to hear of the suffering of children in the Shanghai war zone. At the request of Lady Merield Paget, president of the British Save the Children Fund, the shop has decided to donate cocoa and chocolate candies worth 50 British pounds (equivalent to 800 Chinese yuan), to be shipped to China on May 6th aboard the SS格兰盖里. These items will be distributed by the Shanghai War Zone Orphanage and Asylum, as well as other relevant organizations. The compassion of these foreign friends in providing relief to children is truly commendable. It is noted that the Shanghai War Zone Orphanage and Asylum is jointly established by the Chinese Child Welfare Association, the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association, and the British Save the Children Fund. It has sheltered a total of 95 child refugees. To date, 37 of them have been taken in by others, including 13 by their parents, 4 by relatives, 4 by teachers, 5 adopted as godchildren, 1 apprenticed, and 10 placed in other child welfare organizations. The director of the asylum is Miss Christopher Chancellcr, wife of Mr. Zhang Xuelou, president of Reuters, and daughter of Lady Murield Paget, president of the British Save the Children Fund.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Fellow-Provincials Association</p>
<h3>Request for the Abolition of the Pacification Commissioner's Office</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai sends an urgent telegram to Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, stating: "It is reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Pacification Commissioner's Office has been effectively closed. Upon hearing this news, the public is in a state of anxiety. We have found that in various counties of Jiangsu Province, especially in the areas of Jiangbei, Yangtong, and Huaihai, bandits are rampant, and the people cannot sleep peacefully. Fortunately, since the establishment of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, with Pacification Commissioner Zhang in charge, bandits have gone into hiding, and the region has been able to maintain peace and order. If it is hastily abolished, we fear that the situation will reignite, and villains will seek to act recklessly. In addition, last year's floods in the province, coupled with the failure of this year's spring harvest, have resulted in a large number of refugees and a proliferation of bandits, posing hidden dangers that cause the people to feel as if a great calamity is about to befall them. Therefore, we dare to convey the people's sentiments by sending this telegram to you, humbly requesting that you take the local situation into consideration, heed the public's opinion, and temporarily postpone the abolition of the Pacification Commissioner's Office to maintain order. Depending on the abundance of this year's autumn harvest, the local situation can be assessed, and appropriate measures can be taken accordingly. This would be a blessing for the region, a benefit for the people, and also a contribution to the Party and the nation. We are sending this urgent telegram with the utmost urgency and awaiting your instructions. Respectfully, Xu Qiufan, Wu Yunzhai, Bu Shaoru, and others from the Zhenjiang Five-County Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Pudong Fellow-Provincials Association</p>
<h3>Request to Cancel the Ministry's Approval of Increased Grain Tax</h3>
<p>The collection will continue according to the original plan for the 20th year.</p>
<p>Exemption from collection will be implemented from the 21st year onwards.</p>
<p>On March 2nd, the Ministry of Finance responded to the Pudong Fellow-Provincials Association's request to cancel the additional levy of two yuan on grain tax imposed in the winter of the 20th year: "We have received your petition. Upon review, the petition states that Jiangsu Province requested the additional levy in April of last year, at a time when the signs of disaster were not yet apparent and reports of successive floods had not yet been received, which is indeed the case. Regarding the request to cancel the additional levy of two yuan, we request further instructions from the Executive Yuan after a factual report." This is the reply.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on June 10th, the association received an urgent telegram from the Ministry of Finance: "To the Shanghai Pudong Fellow-Provincials Association: Regarding the case of the additional levy of two yuan on grain tax in Jiangsu in the winter of the 20th year, we previously reported the matter to the Executive Yuan for review and instructions after receiving your association's request for cancellation. Subsequently, we received an order from the Executive Yuan approving the Jiangsu Provincial Government's request to report to the Department of Finance, proposing that the matter be left as it is and requesting a review of the original report, as the points mentioned in the Department's original report were factual. The reasons put forward by the council members in their original report were: first, the original plan was limited to one time in the 19th year, and the extension to the 20th year was a pretext, and it is feared that similar requests will be made in the future, which would be a breach of national trust; second, Jiangsu Province's regulations stipulate that the land tax in each county shall not exceed 1% of the land price, and this additional levy exceeds the 1% range; third, last year was a year of great famine, and taxes should be reduced to alleviate the people's suffering, which is also well-founded. Now that the 20th year is coming to an end, the extension of the additional levy is about to expire. In accordance with the Executive Yuan's approval of the original plan, the extension cannot be renewed under any pretext after the expiration. In order to take into account both the provincial treasury and the people's difficulties, it is suggested that the additional levy on grain tax in Jiangsu for the 20th year should be allowed to continue to be collected according to the original plan, and the Executive Yuan should reiterate its previous order that the deadline for the additional levy on grain tax in Jiangsu should never be extended, and that the exemption should be implemented from the 21st year onwards, in order to show great trust and alleviate the people's difficulties. The Executive Yuan has reviewed and approved the report and ordered compliance. We are now ordered by the Executive Yuan that this case should be directly discussed and handled by the Ministry in consultation with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and a report should be submitted for review and decision. This is the order. Ministry of Finance (Seal)."</p>
<p>Director of the Navigation Administration Bureau</p>
<h3>He Hanlan Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xi Dingmo, Director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau, was transferred to Tianjin by order of the Ministry, and He Hanlan succeeded him. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the new director arrived in Shanghai to take office, and the handover was as follows:</p>
<p>Inauguration Speech: At 9:00 AM yesterday, the new director, He Hanlan, accompanied by Xia Sunpeng and others, arrived at the Navigation Administration Bureau at No. 6 Sichuan Road, where he was greeted by the former director, Xi Dingmo. After a brief rest, they went to the auditorium to hold the inauguration ceremony. The order was very simple. All the bureau staff and the director of the Ningbo Branch were present. Important figures in the Shanghai navigation industry also came to the bureau to attend the ceremony. After the handover ceremony, He Hanlan delivered an inauguration speech, stating that the navigation administration is related to the nation's transportation lifeline and is also linked to commerce. He said that China's navigation industry is still in its infancy, which is undeniable, but it is due to the end of unequal treaties that a situation of guests becoming masters has been created. He said that he was ordered to come to the bureau to study how to revitalize navigation affairs and strive to achieve the hope of fully recovering navigation rights. He said that the former director had achieved great success in handling navigation administration, and that he would follow his example, and so on.</p>

<h3>Gan Jiehou Has No Intention of Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>Gan Jiehou, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, returned to Shanghai not long after resigning and married Ms. Xu Wanjun. He is currently on his honeymoon. According to Gan, recent reports in the newspapers stating that he had plans to go south were inaccurate and that he has no intention of leaving Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Newspaper Labor Strike</h3>
<p>The arrested workers have all been released.</p>
<p>The Newspaper Workers' Union went on strike on the 1st of this month, involving the Shen Bao, Xin Shen Bao, and Shi Bao, in a united action due to the dismissal of workers by the Shi Shi Xin Bao. Subsequently, Mr. Du Yuesheng mediated and the strike was called off. On the 8th, the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau arrested more than 20 former Shi Shi Xin Bao workers who were staying at the Newspaper Workers' Union. Thanks to the rescue efforts of various parties, they were all released yesterday.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Newspaper Workers' Union stated that since the arrest of more than 20 former Shi Shi Xin Bao workers staying at the union on the 8th of this month, instigated by the management of the Shi Shi Xin Bao, the union issued a declaration the day before yesterday, requesting that all sectors uphold justice. This was followed yesterday by the "Sincere Announcement to Society" published by the Shi Shi Xin Bao and the letter from Mr. Zha Renwei, representing the newspaper, to the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao, making corrections. On the surface, the so-called justice, national law, human sentiment, and responsibility are all grand and eloquent, but an analysis of the causes and consequences of this labor dispute will clearly show where the responsibility lies. This labor dispute was entirely caused by the Shi Shi Xin Bao's management's desire to destroy the union's organization, stemming from a failed attempt to print the Da Wan Bao on commission. Initially, all the workers were forced to leave the workplace, and then advertisements were placed in the newspapers to recruit former workers (the workers who returned to work were required to fill out a volunteer form, absolutely obey the newspaper's regulations, and leave the union). This was intended to break up the solidarity of all the workers, and the intentions were obvious to everyone. Subsequently, despite several attempts at mediation by the union and well-meaning parties from the outside, and despite the former workers going to the residence of Mr. Zhang Zhuping, the chairman of the board of directors of the newspaper, several times to petition to return to work, the management of the newspaper remained unmoved. Therefore, the union's entire membership went on strike on the 1st of this month to urge the newspaper's management to reflect. Mr. Du Yuesheng then mediated, and the Shen Bao, Xin Shen Bao, and Shi Bao first resumed work. The dismissal of workers by the Shi Shi Xin Bao was to be resolved by Mr. Du after consulting with the management of the Shi Shi Xin Bao. Unexpectedly, during the period of negotiations between the two parties, the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau came to the union on the 8th of this month and arrested the Shi Shi Xin Bao workers who had been forced to leave. This was not only unfortunate for the arrested workers of the union, but also unexpected by the mediator. The management of the newspaper had already forced these workers into unemployment and was still not satisfied, but wanted to imprison them. How can this be reconciled with the so-called justice, national law, human sentiment, and responsibility? Furthermore, in the correction letter sent by the Shi Shi Xin Bao's representative lawyer, Zha Renwei, to the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao yesterday, it was stated that the union's equipment and belongings were not destroyed. This is a matter of fact, and the union would not dare to falsely accuse anyone. We are currently investigating the destroyed equipment and belongings and taking photographs, which will soon be made public to society. In short, the union's destruction is not only a humiliation for the union, but also a disgrace for all the workers in Shanghai. Although the union is in this unfavorable environment, it does not avoid hardship or fear, and is resolutely fighting for the sake of opening up a glimmer of hope for the dim labor movement in Shanghai. Although the subjective views of labor and management are different, the truth, fairness, and justice will have their own public opinion.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai-Chengdu Route is Renamed the Shanghai-Sichuan Route</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's route from Shanghai to Chengdu was previously named the Shanghai-Chengdu Route because Chengdu's ancient name was Furong (Hibiscus) City. However, the public did not find the use of the character "Rong" to represent Chengdu very clear and often had doubts. Moreover, the route currently only goes to Chongqing, so it would be more appropriate to use the character "Shu" (Sichuan). Therefore, the General Manager, Liu Peiquan, has changed the name of the route to the Shanghai-Sichuan Route in the hope of making it easier to understand, and has reported it to the Ministry of Transportation for record.</p>

<h3>Public Exhibition at Penglai Market</h3>

Everywhere it goes, the public enthusiastically participates, which is beneficial to promoting the future of domestic products. From the 13th to the 15th of this month, it will be exhibited in Shanghai for three days. It was originally scheduled to be held at the county government, but the center is concerned that the venue will be too crowded to accommodate everyone who wishes to attend, so it has been changed to the Penglai Market. Yesterday, the center specially invited all sectors of Shanghai to visit and provide guidance. The original letter is copied below: "To whom it may concern: Our center is holding a native cloth exhibition from June 6th in order to make the Chinese people understand the advantages of native cloth, arouse their awareness of using native cloth, promote agricultural products, improve their lives, and provide farmers with opportunities to compete. It will be publicly exhibited at Penglai Market in your city from June 13th to 15th. The closing ceremony will be held at 10:00 am on the 15th.

<h3>Dies from Shock Caused by Fire</h3>
<p>Careless Boiling of Medicine Causes Fire in Shack</p>
<p>Police Station Forbids Rebuilding of Shacks</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 1:00 AM, the shack of Yao Zhenlai, a native of Jiangbei living in the West Garbage Pond of Yangjia Ferry in Pudong, caught fire because Yao's wife, Chen, was ill and Yao was boiling medicine. Unexpectedly, the charcoal fire shot out, and the bamboo rafters and thatched tiles caught fire immediately. Yao and his son rushed out in panic, but Yao's wife, Chen, collapsed on the bed due to shock and died. The police officers of the First Section of the Third District dragged her out and found that she seemed to have shattered her courage and there was no way to revive her. At that time, the fire spread outward and was very fierce. The fire was then extinguished by the nearby Rongchang Match Factory, which drew water from a pavilion to put out the fire. The fire burned for about an hour, destroying a total of nine shacks and partially destroying two at both ends. Afterwards, Yao Zhenlai, the person who started the fire, saw that his house was destroyed and his wife was dead. He believed that he had caused a great disaster and feared that he would be arrested and punished by the authorities, so he fled with his son without a trace. Yang Zhongquan, the chief of the First Section of the Third District, instructed the local guards to report to the local court to examine the body of Yao's wife. He also issued a notice stating that shacks are most prone to fire, and that all shacks must not be rebuilt to avoid repeating the mistake of the past. The notice reads: "For the purpose of issuing a notice, it is hereby noted that the addition of shacks is not allowed. It has been repeatedly ordered by the Public Security Bureau to strictly prohibit it. Recently, it was found that the West Garbage Pond unfortunately suffered a fire last night. All shacks that were burned and removed must not be rebuilt to prevent fire hazards. This notice is hereby issued to all shack dwellers for compliance. Those who dare to violate this order will be summoned and investigated. Do not say that you were not warned."</p>

<h3>A Gang of Thugs Extort Mr. Zhang Shangyi</h3>
<p>Seven Letters Sent with Threatening Language</p>
<p>Intended to Extort Five Thousand Dollars</p>
<p>Detectives Intercept and Arrest Three Men</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Shangyi, the Chinese Chief Inspector of the Public Concession, residing at No. 123 Chengdu Road, has successively received seven threatening letters from a gang of bandits using the name Li Jianhong, starting last month and continuing until the end of this month. The letters contained violent language and intended to extort five thousand dollars. Zhang reported the letters to the police station and requested an investigation. The day before yesterday morning, Zhang received another phone call from the gang, scheduling a meeting at 5:20 PM in front of the Exchange Building on Avenue Edward VII, and requested a representative to bring the money with a copy of the Dalu Daily as a sign. Zhang reported this again to the police. Chinese detective Wang Chengying disguised himself as a rickshaw puller, and detective Wu Changkai disguised himself as a chauffeur. Detective Zhang Yaoji, posing as Zhang's representative, secretly went to the location. Together with French Concession detectives, they laid an ambush on all sides. Before long, three bandits were seen slowly approaching from Zilai Street opposite. Two bandits stood still at the Avenue Edward VII intersection, acting as lookouts, while one went forward to speak with Detective Zhang and accepted the package, at which point he was arrested. The lookouts were also apprehended. All three were taken to the French Concession police station and then transferred to the Xin Zha police station. After interrogation, the bandit who approached was identified as Que Wenda from Suzhou, also known as Li Jianhong. The two lookouts were named Wang Shuping (also known as Yue Ying, from Haimen) and Wu Zhanlin (also known as Jin Rongsheng, from Nanjing). They confessed to conspiring to extort money, and their statements were recorded. They were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case and submitted the statements, requesting a postponement for further investigation. The court approved the detention. Zhang Shangyi also sent a representative to the court to describe everything. When questioned, the defendant Que Wenda confessed that he knew Wang and Wu. He stated that the whole thing was his own idea. He obtained Zhang Shangyi's address from the telephone book and, using the alias Li Jianhong, wrote letters requesting a loan of five thousand dollars. All previous letters were written by him alone. It was not until the 28th of last month that he told Wang and Wu about the matter at the Changle Tea House and discussed plans. However, by that time, he had already sent five letters and made three phone calls, he claimed. Wang Shuping and Wu Zhanlin both vehemently denied knowing Que, saying they were strangers to him and had nothing to do with the matter. They claimed his words were all lies and that they knew nothing about the threatening letters. They were arrested while passing by the area yesterday. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the confessions and ordered all three defendants to be detained.</p>
<p>Japanese National Illegally Manufactures Morphine</p>
<h3>Chinese Accomplices Sentenced and Fined</h3>
<p>Chief of the Chinese Detective Division of the Public Concession Police, Wang Changgen, and Cao Bingkun, learned on the 23rd of last month that someone was manufacturing morphine equipment at No. 18 West Jiaxing Road to sell to other places for profit. They joined forces with narcotics officers Song Bingzheng, and Chief Inspector Pan Gensi and went to the address in secret. There they arrested the principal offender, a Japanese national named Nakamura, and turned him over to the Japanese consulate for interrogation. Nine Chinese accomplices, Fang Yinbao, Lin Huiqing, Su Ahui, Diao Jinsheng, and cook Wang Kaiyan, along with a large quantity of morphine drugs worth over thirty-five thousand dollars, as well as various machines, tools, wooden boxes, and other items, were taken to the Hongkou police station and transferred to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, the case was ready for sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiao Wanxuan presided over a hearing and sentenced Fang Yinbao, Lin Huiqing, Zhou Yongyuan, Yang Xiuwen, Guo Yuming, and Chen Ruikang to one year and six months in prison and fined them three thousand dollars each for jointly manufacturing opium substitutes. Su Ahui and Diao Jinsheng were sentenced to one year in prison and fined two thousand dollars each for jointly assisting in the manufacture of opium substitutes. If they chose imprisonment instead of paying the fines, the fines would be converted to imprisonment based on the total fine amount divided by the number of days in a year. The number of days the defendants were detained before the verdict was confirmed would be counted as two days of imprisonment for one day of the sentence. The morphine equipment and other items were confiscated according to the list. Wang Kaiyan was found not guilty. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that Wang should be returned to police custody during the appeal period. The court approved.</p>
<h3>Recent Work of the YMCA</h3>
<p>Academic Lectures: To instill knowledge, the Shanghai YMCA initiated a series of academic lectures held every Sunday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Four sessions have already been successfully held, with renowned contemporary figures as speakers, attracting a large audience. The fifth series of lectures was originally scheduled for the spring, but was postponed due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War. Now that social order has been restored, the YMCA has decided to continue the program, starting on June 12th and continuing until August 7th, with the overall theme of "Domestic Peace," divided into nine lectures. The speakers are expected to be Mr. Liu Zhanen, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Maocheng, Wang Xiaolai, He Shangping, Yu Rizhang, Chen Liting, Hu Shuhua, and Liu Wang Liming. It is now summer vacation, and students have a lot of free time, so the number of attendees is expected to be even greater than before. The first lecture of the fifth series is scheduled for this Sunday afternoon at 2:30 PM, with the topic "Non-War and Construction," presented by Dr. Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University. The topic is of pressing importance today, and all Chinese people are eagerly hoping for progress. All those wishing to attend are welcome to the new YMCA location at Baixianqiao.</p>
<p>Radio Broadcast Lectures: The Shanghai YMCA has recently observed the increasing number of people with radio equipment. Merely broadcasting songs only provides entertainment and does not benefit the mind and body. Therefore, the YMCA has decided to utilize radio broadcasting to transmit lectures every Sunday morning from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the Huadong Company broadcasting station. Various topics related to politics, current events, economics, and society will be presented by invited experts. Last week, Mr. Chen Liting reported on "The Visit of the League of Nations Investigation Team to the Three Northeastern Provinces." This Sunday, Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, has been specially invited to report on "The Shanghai Incident." All those with radio receivers are urged not to miss this excellent opportunity.</p>

<h3>Dongdong Hosiery Factory Clearance Sale Ending Soon</h3>
<p>The main branch of the Dongdong Hosiery Factory on Nanjing Road and the Nan branch inside Xiaodongmen have been holding a grand clearance sale and giving away gifts for the past fourteen days since June 5th. The factory is usually not inclined to offer discounts, so this sale has been particularly popular. The attached clearance department has been especially busy, with seasonal summer items such as ramie shirts and trousers, silk and cotton socks, and Parisian cosmetics selling in large quantities every day. The courteous service of the factory staff has also greatly satisfied customers. The clearance sale and gift promotion will only last for seven more days. After that, there will be no extension.</p>
<h3>Excellent Contributions from the Manufacturing Sector</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, all compatriots have been filled with righteous indignation, sharing a common hatred and vowing never to forget this humiliation. In light of this, the Peide Necktie Factory has invented the "January 28th" Western-style cufflinks, which are finely crafted, smooth, elegant, exquisite, and durable, as well as being of high quality and low price. They truly lead the way in the domestic goods manufacturing sector. The main purpose is to promote domestic goods, resist foreign imports, and allow the Chinese people to permanently commemorate the January 28th tragedy. Western-style clothing people are extremely satisfied with their purchase, so they are selling very well in the market.</p>

<h3>Talking About Family Matters</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>The big family system has long been recognized as unsuitable for modern trends. The small family system should emerge in response.</p>
<p>"Five generations under one roof" and "eight generations not separated" sound good in name, but a closer examination of their content reveals discord between sisters-in-law, opposition between mothers-in-law, and even brothers may not be able to live in harmony. One criticizes the other for spending too much, while the other boasts about their living conditions. Internal conflicts are bound to be fierce, but bound by the old ethics and held hostage by the head of the family, they have no choice but to endure.</p>
<p>Now, the names "five generations under one roof" and "eight generations not separated" are no longer sufficient to rally people and cannot be considered good stories. Even the authority of the head of the family cannot govern the entire family. "Fratricide" and "sibling rivalry" occur, with younger brothers disowning older brothers and mothers-in-law bullying daughters-in-law. Within the family, complaints are often heard. "When the fence is broken, wild dogs come in." Bandits and thugs take advantage of the situation. A good family is reduced to a mess.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, organizing small families is more appropriate. Establishing the principle of "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door and doesn't care about the frost on the roof of others," each household sets up its own business, produces its own goods, and strives on its own. Perhaps the family can achieve modest prosperity one day.</p>
<p>If we continue to struggle to maintain the empty façade of "five generations under one roof" and "eight generations not separated," I fear that the family will be completely destroyed.</p>

<h3>Crying Willow Chen</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zun</p>
<p>A strong wind blows through willow branches, only making a soft sound.</p>
<p>Self-proclaimed softness overcomes strength, this principle is indeed unparalleled.</p>
<p>Pines and cypresses hear it and weep, I am born strong and independent.</p>
<p>I would rather be broken into a thousand pieces than be swayed by the wind.</p>
<h3>Hearing the Cuckoo</h3>
<p>Transformed into millions of souls, how many cuckoos are newly added?</p>
<p>Crying non-stop day and night, the tears of travelers fall drop by drop.</p>
<p>Compared to last year's cries, there seem to be countless more grievances.</p>
<p>Don't call to return home, guard the national gate in life and death.</p>
<h3>National Mourning</h3>
<p>In memory of the fallen soldiers in the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War</p>
<p>In life, I wish to be soil, to bury the souls of national martyrs.</p>
<p>In poetry, I wish to be a lament, to mourn the grievances of national martyrs.</p>
<p>Brave soldiers died for the country, their spirits will live on forever.</p>
<p>The Chinese are not a weak race, thanks to you for making it clear.</p>
<p>Bitter was the thirty-day battle, repeatedly pursuing the powerful enemy.</p>
<p>Sad were the traitors who appeased the enemy, providing no assistance for thirty days.</p>
<p>Your achievements were almost successful, the people of the country share the grief.</p>
<p>Offering distant condolences in the wind, you will forever be the god of national warfare.</p>

<h3>How to Install a Lightning Rod</h3>
<p>— Yun Li</p>
<p>Dear readers! In the previous article "What is Lightning?", I told you that when two kinds of electricity with different yin and yang properties come into contact in the air, they not only produce an explosive sound but also can harm people, animals, and buildings on the ground. From this perspective, this kind of electricity is extremely dangerous. But, what methods can we use to avoid it?</p>
<p>In 1752 AD, 178 years ago, the famous American scientist Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning rod after experimenting with electricity in the air using a kite.</p>
<p>, used to protect houses and the people and animals inside, so now most tall buildings have this kind of lightning rod installed.</p>
<p>A lightning rod is a metal rod (Note). Its installation method is to place this metal rod at the highest point of the roof. The upper end of the metal is sharp, and the lower end is connected to a metal wire; the lower end of the metal wire is connected to several metal plates. Then bury these metal plates in the dampest place underground. Because the ground is damp, it is easier to conduct electricity.</p>
<p>With a lightning rod installed on the roof, how can we avoid the danger of electricity? However, we must understand; all substances contain electricity, and this metal rod naturally contains electricity as well. The reason why we don't usually feel electricity is because the amounts of yin and yang electricity are balanced, that is, they are harmonized, which is what electrical scientists call "neutralization."</p>
<p>If there is a thunderstorm, the electricity in the clouds is harmful because the amounts of yin and yang electricity are not balanced. The excess electricity will attract the opposite type of lightning that is lacking. That is, an excess of positive electricity will attract negative electricity, and an excess of negative electricity will attract positive electricity, so the danger of lightning arises.</p>
<p>To avoid this danger of electricity, we only need to use a lightning rod to eliminate the excess positive lightning or excess negative electricity. Because the upper end of the needle is sharp, it is easy to discharge electricity. When a cloud carrying an excess of negative electricity comes near the lightning rod, the positive electricity contained in the needle is released from the tip of the needle due to induction, neutralizing the electricity in the clouds and causing it to disappear; the remaining part of the negative electricity in the needle is transmitted to the ground through the metal wire. If the cloud carries positive electricity, the lightning rod will release negative electricity to neutralize it; the remaining part of the positive electricity is transmitted to the ground through the metal wire. In short, whether it brings positive lightning or negative electricity, it always releases electricity of the opposite polarity to neutralize it, so it can avoid the danger of lightning.</p>
<p>Why does the bottom of the lightning rod need to be connected to some metal sheets buried in the dampest underground? This is because during a heavy thunderstorm, when clouds carrying negative electricity come near the needle, the positive electricity on the needle is released from the tip of the needle, leaving an excess of negative electricity; if clouds carrying positive electricity come near the needle, the negative electricity on the needle is released from the tip of the needle, leaving an excess of positive electricity. The excess negative electricity</p>
<p>or positive electricity left in this way must be sent to the ground through a metal wire in order to completely avoid danger. Therefore, those metal sheets must be buried in the dampest underground. If they are buried in dry underground, the lightning rod will lose its effectiveness. Because dry land is not a good conductor and does not easily transmit lightning.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned installation method, there is another way to install a lightning rod. That is to make the metal wire into a mesh shape and cover it on the upper part of the house to avoid the disaster of lightning, but in any case, a metal wire must be used to connect several metal plates to the ground.</p>
<p>(Note) Substances such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin are all called metals. Red copper is best for making lightning rods.</p>

<h3>(5) A Tour of ×× Company</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>The long hand points directly at eleven o'clock, five minutes short of leaving the office, Xiao Wenying's heart is beating rapidly? He remembers Yuan Jinzhi's Introduction to Gambling, which is much more fun than the dead salary of sitting in the office, he tidies up the things on his desk, preparing for the clanging of the clock.</p>
<p>The two walked side by side towards ×× Company, Yuan Jinzhi talked about the stories of women as if nothing had happened, although Xiao Wenying was eager to understand the situation of ×× Company, but there was no room for him to interject, he only heard him suddenly say softly "We're here" It is the ××× intersection that is often walked, several special figures wearing black long gowns always sit idly at the door.</p>
<p>He lowered his head and followed Jinzhi through a long corridor, and he heard noisy sounds coming from every crowd, he really wanted to squeeze in to see what it was like, who knew that Jinzhi had stepped onto the stairs facing the corridor, without any experience, he had no choice but to follow the experienced guide up another floor.</p>
<p>The upstairs and downstairs are completely different, like entering a women's country, many Shanghai women who do business with cosmetics stores every day, with their charming eyes, watching the balls in the plate roll into the number of their own pressed cakes, although like a champagne ticket, there is one number that occupies the final victory, but many disappointed expressions first chilled the heat of Xiao Wenying when he came in.</p>
<p>Yuan Jinzhi bought thirty yuan worth of numbers, as if he was managing bookkeeping in the company every day, engaging in a battle with fate on the Arabic numerals, Wenying held the banknotes in his pocket and was always hesitant and did not have the courage to take them out, thinking that Jinzhi, who had written the Introduction to Gambling, spent thirty yuan rolling into Guangdong Bank in the sound of the bell... (probably the gambling bosses who talk about gambling classics all know the allusion of Guangdong Bank) his forehead was like a customer who had entered the ice-drinking room, he walked out slowly as if he was going to the West Cannon Platform, and forgot that there was a Xiao Wenying behind him who was relying on him as an experienced guide.</p>
<p>Coming out of the company one after another, each with different emotions, disappearing into the shadows.</p>

<h3>A Youth and a Beggar</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>On a street with few pedestrians, there were only one or two filthy and ragged beggars sitting under the eaves of people's houses, looking for lice the size of wheat grains on their bodies, and repeatedly putting them in their mouths, the way they looked, compared to modern men and women eating Western food together, was several times more interesting,</p>
<p>From afar came the sound of clattering leather shoes, gradually from far to near, the beggar immediately stopped catching lice, stood up, and greeted the young man wearing leather shoes,</p>
<p>"Good sir, may you be blessed and live a long life, do a good deed丨" he said very sincerely,</p>
<p>"·······" The young man continued to walk as if no one was there,</p>
<p>"Alas, sir, I haven't eaten for two days, do a good deed" he said with a mournful face, showing a very pitiful appearance,</p>
<p>"······" The young man walked away without looking back,</p>
<p>The sound of clattering leather shoes gradually went from near to far again, the poor beggar, waited until he could no longer see his shadow, before walking back to where he was originally sitting in disappointment to do his lice-catching work,</p>
<p>Tomorrow I saw the young man wearing leather shoes again, following behind a beautiful student-like girl in ×× Park, this is probably what Shanghai people call stalking,</p>
<p>"Miss, what is your name, what school do you go to, can we be friends?" he asked very sincerely,</p>
<p>"······" She continued to walk as if no one was there, "Alas Miss now that social interaction is open, men and women are equal, it doesn't matter if we become friends, why don't you pay attention to me, ······" he said very eagerly,</p>
<p>"······" She walked out of the park gate without looking back,</p>
<p>He stood at the door, watching her back, going far away, before taking a breath, and walking into the park in disappointment, still acting like a rickshaw man,</p>
<p>The Problem of Livelihood</p>
<h3>A Sketch of Life</h3>
<p>— Yun Zhi</p>
<p>"Madam, why don't you buy it, there are only twelve catties in total, consider it doing a good deed," said an old country woman in tattered clothes,</p>
<p>"You sell broad beans, I have copper coins and you have goods, why do you say such pitiful things?" A wealthy country lady asked suspiciously,</p>
<p>"No, madam, if you buy it, I still have to quickly pick up another load and sell it again丨"</p>
<p>"Why are you in such a hurry?"</p>
<p>"Because I need at least three dollars urgently tomorrow, and I don't have a single penny in hand yet,"</p>
<p>"What do you need three dollars for urgently?"</p>
<p>"Because I have hired six helpers at home to plant sweet potatoes tomorrow, I need at least three dollars, and I still owe the money for 20,000 sweet potato seedlings,"</p>
<p>"Don't you still have people at home?"</p>
<p>"Alas, don't even mention it, a son raised to eighteen years old, carried a load of salt to the town to sell, because his father was sick, who knew he would be taken away by the smugglers, not only was the salt confiscated, but he was also beaten, he couldn't stand seeing his son sick and dying, a wife who was married, was taken back to her maiden family from then on, now there are only two old bones left for us, a couple in their sixties, but they refuse to die, if we are alive, we have to eat," said the old woman, her eyes turning red,</p>
<p>"How much field do you need to plant now for the old couple to eat?" The lady asked pitifully, "When my son was alive, we rented sixteen acres of fields, now we have to return it to others to plant, and we only plant ten acres ourselves, after paying six dollars per acre for rent, it's really impossible to live this year," said the old woman, her eyes turning red again,</p>
<p>"Okay, then you sell all these broad beans to us, here, here's the money,"</p>
<p>"Good, truly Amitabha,"</p>
<p>"Oh, I've talked too much, I'm still in a hurry to go home," said the old woman, taking the money and leaving in a hurry, (Quotations)</p>

<h3>Miss Muxian Who Wants But Cannot Help It</h3>
<p>Is it because there is freedom of marriage between men and women today, so I feel the pain of old-style marriage, or is it that old-style marriage has always been painful? This major problem, the painful problem, like a seventeen-year-old girl, I can't solve it after all,</p>
<p>My good classmate, lives near my neighborhood, Yimeng who was born in the same year as me, fortunately, is getting married at the end of this month, ever since she knew her wedding date ten days ago, she has been crying and weeping, and her face has been washed with tears all day long, her two eye bags are already like walnuts, she is not worried because she is young and suddenly leaves the embrace of her kind and loving parents and is sent to her husband's family where she is unfamiliar, nor is she used to being pampered at home, but she is given a poor husband, which is not the case at all,</p>
<p>Her only reason, is that her parents forced her to choose a spouse, so she is absolutely dissatisfied,</p>
<p>Her husband's family can be regarded as a deformed family, pieced together successfully, except for her father-in-law, her mother-in-law is a concubine, and her future husband is an adopted son, her father-in-law also has a secret little wife who is married outside, now living in the house, and already has children, and her mother-in-law also has a daughter born to her former husband, although she has married someone, because her son-in-law does not produce anything, she still relies on her father-in-law for a living,</p>
<p>When Yimeng was young, her father-in-law was still a peddler, he lived in a low house near a good family, because he was lucky in wealth, developed one day after another, and now he has a little family property, Yimeng's father, seeing that he had money, gave his daughter to him to be his daughter-in-law, at that time she was young and didn't understand anything, until in the recent three or four years, what day has she not been opposed to this marriage, she has raised objections to her parents several times, crying and weeping, and she has not been satisfied with this marriage, she has used all her methods, sometimes she pleads with her parents, sometimes she uses righteousness to touch her parents, but she is always disappointed, and she does not get results, the most recent time, she used her own life to scare them, not only did she not get her parents' love, but she was suppressed with violence,</p>
<p>This time her wedding date is so urgent, as far as I know, her mother-in-law is very seriously ill, and the doctor has given up, so they are eager to marry a daughter-in-law, in preparation for her to wear plain clothes and mourning after her death,</p>
<p>My dear Yimeng, I really want but cannot help it, how can I help you,</p>
