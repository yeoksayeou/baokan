<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c1">廢兩改元的我見寰澄 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>廢兩改元的呼聲。自前清光緒末年到現在。差不多鬧了二十六七年。兩還是兩。元還是元毫無功效。最近洋厘之小洋底之多。開歷來未有之新紀錄。的確是廢兩改元的好時機。金融業及財政當局。擬趁此時機。實行廢兩改元。我人希望中國有較劃一較有系統的幣制。當然表示贊成。</p>
<p>此問題的本身。没有是否問題可以討論。所應討論者。（一）辦法。（二）時期。現在辦法。尙未宣布。無從知其得失。其中最重要者。當爲兩與元的定價問題廢兩則欵必須照定價合成銀元。以後更無洋厘名目。存規銀者。希望銀元定價小。則以銀合元。元存數較多。欠規銀者。希望銀元定價大。則以元合銀。欠數較少各有各的切己利害。我想必當按照國幣含銀實質。（以最低次最近流行者爲準）參酌鑄費及現在市價爲定價標準。務使債權債務兩得其平。則定價不難决定。</p>
<p>其次則爲現有銀元。是否是彀全國流通。如不彀用。必須開廠添鑄。現在洋厘低跌。凡銀質較好之銀元如墨洋·舊龍洋·初期袁頭洋·多數遭銀爐　燬。將來若不彀用。仍須添鑄。（上海存底雖多。然全國是否彀用。是一問題。）低價燬而高價鑄。一出一入。使用貨幣者。吃虧不少。國計上亦屬不經濟辦法。將來設或改變本位。廣鑄銀元。豈非白白煩費。去年曾在中社演講金銀問題。略略發表意見。今節錄如下。</p>
<p>廢兩改元的疑難地方。（一）鑄造大批銀幣。需長期間與大費用。而且需要數量。極難準確。（二）銀兩行用已久。舊金融家憑你。習慣一時不易。打破我想用一種簡易方法。來統一各地通貨。作爲暫時過渡的幣制。辦理手續。分作兩期。第一期廢除各地銀兩名目。以規銀統一之。第二期廢除洋厘。確定規銀與銀元之比價。袛有兌換而無買賣。商貨市價。槪以元計。不得再以兩計。銀元或鈔票。滿千元始准兌銀。中央銀行及政府指定兌換之銀行。照定價兌換。不取手續費。商業銀行及莊舖兌換手續費。不得超過千分之一。政府祗鑄輔幣。以足需之程度爲止。不必再鑄大洋。同時應於第一期辦竣兩事。（一）廢除海關關平銀。（二）國際匯兌應用銀元計價。主持外匯之銀行。按日掛牌。任商家用銀元買賣外匯。</p>
<p>用此辦法之利益。（一）省却鑄造大宗銀元之煩費。（二）鈔票不專以銀元爲準備。（銀兩亦可爲現金準備。）發行較便。流通更易。（三）保留一部分習慣。旋行便利。（詳見金銀問題講稿第五節十一十二十三頁）</p>
<p>照所引述的辦法。規銀名存而實廢。鄙見頗認爲廢兩改元最簡易便利之辦法。可以尅期程功。天下事利弊相因。當然不免也有許多流弊。很願意儘量作鄒蕘之獻。有賜駁敎。尤所歡迎。</p>
<p>至於時期。當然以速爲妙。然錢業公會致財政部電。以（須經過種種籌備。然後明令公布。予人民以相當猶豫期間）爲請。事恐不能速定。時期與辦法相關連。若照鄙說。至遲十個月可以把廢兩改元辦竣。願金融家勿失此時機　　（更正）昨評中（然二十餘年來經四十次國際會議）句中之二字係誤植·應取銷·特亟更正·</p>

<p>東京通信青邨</p>
<p>歷年來日本黨政積弊的遠因、及輓近世界不景氣的近因、交相煎迫下造成了今日日本農村的窮乏、</p>
<p>在過去數年間、日本政府當局、也曾厘訂過治標的救濟策劃丨低利資金之通融、但這通融的結果、不惟無補於農村之挽救、且將使農村前途愈趨於衰頽、政府低利資金的放欵方法、通常是由道·府·縣、勸業銀行·農業銀行·信用組合聯合會等機關經手、分（一）不動產擔保放欵、（二）十人以上連帶信用放欵、（三）町村債放欵、（自町村再貸付於有十人以上之連帶信用者）、（四）購買組合·農事組合等之團體放欵、這些放欵的規程與條件、非常苛刻、因此事實上得以融通低利資金的、祗是一些小地主階級、而一般貧農、往往以缺乏擔保品成不適合放欵條件而遭拒絕、像這樣的救濟、結果是一無所獲、縱令貧民們一旦僥倖而借得低利資金、實際上這資金都化用在不生產的生活費和前賬的清償上、至於使用於產業方面者、實百不得一、結局、貧農是愈救濟愈窮、終於在利息盤剥之下、結束了它一生的運命、　　這裏有兩個實例、（第一件）神奈川縣津久并郡某村、某佃農向官廳告借低利資金、結果拿到的是一張負欠證書、而非現金、據官廳的職員說、這佃農　納村稅甚夥、屢催不繳、因此於放欵時全數扣去、不足欵額、載明於負欠證書、這佃農不惟没有享受到低利資金的些微小惠、反而憑空多負了一重利息的盤剝、（第二件）在山梨縣之低利資金、平均每人可得五十圓左右、但一些僻處深山的佃農、老遠的跑上縣衙門或勸業銀行支店去告借、要費去二十圓的旅費、結局五十圓借欵到手時、祗留得三十圓大洋了、這佃農借了三十圓歸還五十圓、用了三十圓付五十圓的利息、結局（低利資金）轉變爲（高利放欵）了、</p>
<p>尤其在最近數年來、日本農業經營的利率、平均不足四五分、土地價格、也較昔崩落、政府的救濟放欵、在金融方面是低利資金、但從農業經營的立塲而論、已是極高的高利貸了、</p>
<p>日本農村的借金、除低利資金以外、還有從普通銀行、無盡會社及個人（抵擋或信用放欵）借得的、據本年三四月間羣馬縣農會的調查、羣馬縣下有十一萬八千戸農家、人口六十二萬三千人、負債總額達九千三百四十七萬六十圓、平均一戸負擔八百圓、一人負擔一百五十圓、這個負債的年利率大約爲九分八厘左右、每年應付七百十三萬圓的利息、平均每戸負擔六十圓四十錢、每人負擔十七圓三十錢、反之、農家每年所得、平均每戸僅三百四十七圓四十二錢、與負債額及利息額相比、尙不足五百十二圓九十八錢、這個悲痛的數目、很足以反映出日本農民的境過了、</p>
<p>借欵的重重剝削、已夠陷農民於深陷地獄而萬刧不復、但實際不僅這樣、肥料商還榨取着農民的熱血和　肉、</p>
<p>肥料全在農業經營上是一筆極大的支出、統計最近日本全年的肥料消費額爲六　二千萬元、（購入肥料二億九千萬元自給肥料三億三千萬元）平均每戸約當五十元以上、近年以來、農產物價格暴落、一般農家對於肥料金的償付、當然不能如期歸還、債台愈作愈高、窟寵愈挖愈大、在這裏、肥料商人想了一個極妙的方法、譬如某農民今年欠肥料商一百元、到年終祇歸還了八十元、其餘未納的二十元、即由某農民出立借據、按年以十八分算息、農民每年買肥料、每年拖欠貨欵、久而久之、借票上的數額漸漸增加、利息愈加愈大、到最後這農民的財產全部、就在這借要下犧牲、而肥料商就在這借票上大腹便便了、此外、還有一種肥料商人、通常　　米　賣買、他的方法也極妙、這些肥料商人在米榖應價時、和農民訂立肥料賒賣契約、而肥料貨欵的收取不是現金、而以米榖拆價、結局肥料商人賤價買米、高價賣米其間的利益、槪由肥料商人落腰、而農民見着這種不法行爲、也無可如何、有時候祗能自嘆自怨的念着（天作孽、）這（天作孽）三字、是多麽沉痛的音調、茨城縣水戸市的某大肥料商、據說在七八年前還是住小房子、拉肥料車的朋友、但現在已是金百萬了、</p>
<p>關於農民的借欵、在山形縣還有兩種特别的方法、（一）寒　、（二）青田賣、寒　是農民冬季借欵的一法、換言之、以來年的春繭預賣、向别人告貨欵項的方法、農民明知這是（自殺借欵、）但逼於環境而不能不含涙忍痛的予賣、（青田賣）也是一種抵押借欵、以未成熟的米榖作抵、借用欵項方法、這種借欵的利息通常是按年二十分、外加手續費二十分、換言之、八十元的借欵、應歸還一百二十元、結局、農民往往因米榖成熟後所得的代價、不足清償債務、</p>
<p>總之、日本農村的現狀、已是到了崩潰的境地、但農民是活人、當然不能甘於陷入深阱而没有呼聲、這裏、我們祗須檢討一下近來日本的佃業爭議數、就不難立時明白日本農民是在奮鬭挣扎中、據日本農林省的調查、大正六年的佃業爭議是八五件、昭和二年是二○五二件、三年是一八六六件、四年是二四三四件、五年是二四七八件、六年度是二六八九件、這種超速度增加的佃業爭議中、以田租减免、未納田租年付償還期限延期等之爭議爲最多、佃業爭議的結果、地主們不僅不略加憐憫、且更燃燒起反對意識、提議種植前歸還土地、然而孤苦無告的佃農、如何再能忍受這壓迫、</p>
<p>佃業爭議頻添的結果、使地主己大有不安於位之感、於是紛紛賣却了地產逃入都會、而都會中失業的羣衆、却風漲雲湧的流回到鄉間來、這種的人事移動、使農村更多了一層脅威、山窮水盡疑無路、可爲日本今日之農村寫眞、而柳暗花明又一村的境地、將不知重現於何日、</p>

<p>（七）亞林匹克委員會與遠東體育恊會之關係</p>
<p>國際亞林匹克委員會與遠東體育恊會之目的相同、其所用以達此目的之方法亦同、且皆已成功多年、其間自應有密切之關係、夫亞林匹克委員會之範圍、爲全界的、惟在世界各國運動上之發展、其機會頗不平等、　求普遍運動之實現、殊非易事、故亞林匹克委員會之思想、必須有一種發展之機關、必須能維持最高之業餘運動標準、並以提倡普遍運動爲宗旨、至於運動明星之養成、則係出於偶然的、並非由於提倡也、</p>
<p>遠東體育恊會乃一較爲幼稚之團體、不啻爲亞林匹克委員會之子女其取法於亞林匹克委員會者頗多、如遠東運動會之秩序、儘量仿照亞林匹克運動大會、惟有限於各國情形者、不在此例、現下大會會期己改爲每四年舉行一次、且與亞林匹克運動會相間行之、以免有衝突之虞焉、</p>
<p>遠東體育恊會之原名爲遠東亞林匹克競技會、ＴheHarEasternOlympicAssociation亞林匹克委員會之西名爲ＴlympicCommittee後因亞林匹克委員會請勿用ＯlynPic字、始改爲遠東體育恊會、ＴFarEasternAlbleticAssociation</p>
<p>兩會現有之關係、並非出於强迫、亞林匹克委員會對於遠東體育恊會、並無限制、亦不侵犯其特權、而遠東體育恊會則因此關係得以增加其聲譽勢力、並於同時使亞林匹克委員會與世界競技情形之接觸愈廣、亞林匹克會於每次遠東運動會時、派委員一人爲專使、並於關係各國内指定一有名之運動家、爲亞林匹克運動大會專門代表、以指導關於遠東運動大會之事件、並促進其發展、</p>

<p>世界上的專制國大槪要絕跡了罷。暹邏的革命，已告成功，世界上的專制國，又弱一個了。</p>
<p>朋友聽我談專制，他忽的想起一件猴的專制故事後。據他說；是從嶺南雜記上看下來的。我案頭没有這部書，但把朋友的話，記在下面；</p>
<p>嶺南某山裏面，有一種專制的猴，其名曰絨，身倍常猴，毛作金色，號稱猴類中的魔王。平日專以猿猴爲糧。狨要吃猴時，長嘯一聲，羣猴聞聲畢集，羅跪在狨面前，狨便逐一揣其肥瘦。較肥者拾一塊小石，頂在猴的頭上，猴不敢動；狨又長嘯一聲，餘猴悉去，惟有戴石的猴，恭恭敬敬随着狨到河邊，入水洗濯，又自撏其毛，使凈，撏罷，赤裸裸的臥在地上，聽憑狨的大嚼，狨的專制魔力，一至於此！</p>
<p>我聽罷這故事，喟然久之·</p>
<p>道不是寓言，現在世界上何嘗没有狨一類的專制魔王·可憐的箕子遺民，已做了頭頂石塊的猴子，供給那魔王大嚼，那魔王，吃了朝鮮人不算，又要來吃我關外的同胞了，凡是願給魔王吞噬的民衆，實際上已不是民衆，成爲弱肉供給强食的猴子了，</p>
<p>再仆再起的馬將軍，他爲什麽抵抗到底？他便是怕做頭頂石塊的猴子！</p>

<p>— 彭立成自南昌寄</p>
<p>南昌近日發生一種生理變異之怪事。一時轟動社會。各報爭先載錄。事屬離奇。爰錄之本談。以供研究。</p>
<p>距南昌百餘里之豐城縣。日前有一對新結婚之青年夫婦。當新婚之夕。自不免雙雙燕爾。實行結婚的一種任務。詎意初探桃源。進退遂失自由。有如理學上之一種吸力然。雖經雙方力求分開。均不能如願。迨至天明被家人察覺之後。遂雙雙送入本邑某醫院診治。以外屬缺乏良好醫故。僉不敢妄加診斷。乃復雙雙抬至南昌城内。求治於負時譽之聖敎思醫院。但該院亦以此種生理變異。頗爲創聞。對於治療上殊感棘手。除開刀分離一法外。實無他法。於是徴得雙方家長之同意。即施行手術。惟該院未施行手術以前。曾聲明二人之中。祇一人可保安全。否則非醫力所能辦到。施行之結果。男性幸獲安全。女性則因無法救治。當即慘斃血泊中。聞二人自結婚以至開刀之日。已近一星期之久。在此時期間。雙體密接。即大小二便。亦絲毫不能分離。由兩腿流下。亦云苦矣。現南昌醫界人士。聞訊之後。咸紛至該院要求公開參觀。但該院醫士。則聲言此種生理變態之事。素少聞見。療治之法。亦乏研究。至於施行手術。亦出於不得已。故未肯應允公開參觀云。想滬上不乏中西良醫。未識亦能道其理由否。</p>
<h3 id="c112">梅之噄法 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>余嗜梅。人或見之。牙酸涎流。避之唯恐不速。而余啖之。覺津津其有味焉。然本草綱目亦載之。固有藥用上之價值。而羣芳譜且著有煑梅之論。可知梅之爲物。今特不研究耳。苟有科學思想者利用之。抑亦良好之食品。而有益於人生者。殆匪細也。</p>
<p>今歲梅之收穫。較之前歲爲豐。俗謂之熟年。實則去臘下雪稀少。雖羅浮庾嶺。其性喜暖。而百年老榦。名園古刹中。亦復樛曲萬狀。横斜疎瘦之後。結實纍纍。固不獨吾邑爲然。去歲每斤價值可售小洋一角。而其物猶求過於供。今乃僅售每斤銅圓四五枚。而竟無人過問。亦可謂相懸甚已。兼以兵燹。糖價過昻。而天多陰雨。購者益尠。前此以梅爲樹藝較便。栽植亦易。提剏以爲園圃中之佳卉者。輒曰梅三桃四。謂梅秧三年後。即可出品牟利。今則反是。不知梅之實用極廣。價值旣廉。而任其過剩。抑亦大可惜焉。</p>
<p>當避兵之際。余往珠溪。見市招有懸清水梅皮者。初以爲異。嗣詢之當地某君。乃知爲特產。購而食之。厥味甚美。唯性過甜。其眞已失。所謂清水者。非其實矣。而每歲市售。雖非大宗。獲利甚鉅。余因思梅之最爲普通食品者。莫如陳皮梅。而今製此者。以其利之所在。恒以他物代之。名是而實非。苟有味覺。一辨即知其眞贋。實則製法極易。試以梅百斤。食用鹽百分之十。置之於陶器中。使之上下平均。約三日後。再加以清水。減去其鹹性。然後將水瀝下。以糖液百分之五十。沈浸其梅胚後。約一日。則其酸素亦漸失。而與糖質成中和性。食之適口爲度。其物之功用。較之梅醬·梅糊·梅板·梅蘇。梅乾。以及烏梅。梅粘。與夫冷麥。遮厘·咭汁布甸等品實廣。其調合之附屬物。只須甘草·丁香·薄荷·薑未·八角而已·最佳。復加以擰檬。或含芳烈之細粉以融和之。其味益妙。吾邑出品。視他處爲遲。值此梅熟之時。苟能製之。且亦清暑辟穢家常之一良物也。</p>

<p>淞滬戰區之遺跡。攝取於　相者固夥·形之於筆　者尙　　日本於停戰前。已由海陸軍當局。延名畫家和田三造岡田三郎等來滬實寫多幅。携往東京展覽。我國於停戰恊定後。方由名畫家王濟遠面請吳市長紹介撤兵接管委員主席殷亦農發證明書。開始在江灣閘北吳淞砲台灣各地實寫殘跡。不避風雨。不畏烈日。迭經艱難。卒由王氏寫成水彩書數十幅。實屬可貴。茲王氏已於九日起。在吕班路麥賽而蒂羅路九十號二樓濟遠薰琴畫室中。舉行展覽會六日。每日下午一時至七時。公開展覽。開幕之日。王景岐氏即席口占七絕一首。題於濟遠紀念册上。有回想頽垣斜照裏。一行血淚一揮毫之句。</p>

<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>（四）　字工廠</p>
<p>印刷廠中所用之鉛字。大都向　字工廠買來。此項　字工廠。上海有幾十家之多。除商務中華世界各大書店外。以倫鷄橋之華豐鑄字工廠爲最大。而申新等報館。除自　自用外。亦可　買與人者。</p>
<p>字最重要者。爲　模。往往以銅模雕刻之深淺均匀。及字樣之端正秀挺。以定鉛字之好惡。上項　模。以</p>
<p>多來自日本。近年國人亦能製造之。上海全市有該項工廠十餘家。而以閘北王震　爲最著名。然較之日貨。尙遲一籌。故大印刷大報館。需用　模時。仍多購自日本。深望該業工藝家注意之。</p>
<p>鉛字分高低二種。高者曰大陸式。以德國字體爲標準。低者曰島式。以英美字體爲標準。故買者須聲明用何式。否則買來之字。與原有之字。高低不同。不能排印矣。惟中文鉛字。大都用島式。西文鉛字。則各家所　不同。故買者須注意也。</p>
<p>製造鉛字時。先以　模裝置　字機中。再度其高低。配上　字盒。舊式者。用手搖　字機。每搖止一字。而搖出之字。皆有尾。須加工去之。再用小刨床刨光。磨工磨光。方可應用。新式　字機。皆用馬達拖帶。所　之字。　出卽可應用。毋須刨磨等工耳。手搖機。價僅百餘元。自動者。價須萬金矣。上項自動鑄字機。以上海德商泰來洋行所經理之克斯門廠出品爲最佳。美貨次之。蓋德機可出字樣一號至七號。每小時可鑄三四千字。美貨則不能鑄七種之多矣。至舊式手搖者。每小時僅可　百餘字。相差幾一二十倍。前聞我國閘北之建業機器廠。業已仂製德貨。尙未竣工。忽遭兵燹。付諸一炬。至可嘆也。</p>
<p>鉛字出售以磅計。每磅價洋三角至四角。字體小者較貴。至鑄字之鉛。均外貨。設完全以鉛鑄。則字體不能堅固耐用。須酌和點銅錫。及安的木尼。大約點銅錫百分之三。安的木尼百分之七。</p>
<h3 id="c115">古廟敲鐘錄（四）（八） <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>五十二</p>
<p>我這些時候對於我的敲鐘職務是覺得更有意義。古廟的生活似乎是與我所敲的鐘聲結了不解緣。就以這軍事與國術的訓練講吧，便離不了鐘。我們没得啦叭。也没有號筒，這口大鐘便代替了他們做那發號施令之工作。因爲大家幹得起勁，我也就敲得起勁。可是農人說因爲我敲得起勁，所以他們就幹得起勁。大槪這兩方面的話都對，幹得起勁便敲得起勁·敲得愈起勁便幹得格外起勁了。</p>
<p>今天晚上黄團長，朱先生·江營長張師傅秘密會議議决於夜深十二時下緊急集合令演習夜戰。全村没有第五個人知道這個秘密。連我都不知道今晚會有這麽一套把戲。緊急集合令是三聲，三聲的急敲。凡是這種鐘聲一響，大家都得立刻從被窩裏跳出來，拿了各人保管的武器。跑到各人預定的地點，聽候命令。無故不到或遲到的，或忘帶保管之武器或跑錯了地點都要嚴厲之處分。他們在十一時五十分的時候把我從被窩裏拖出來·要我敲這從未敲過之緊急集合鐘。這雖是出我不意然而我是想之已久了。我是多麽的高興啊丨只聽鐘聲一響，妻子推丈夫，嫂嫂喊叔叔，姊姊很弟弟，媽媽喊兒子，都說是土匪到了，快起來丨各人依距離的遠近，三分，五分。七分。十分鐘都到了預定的要壅上預定的地位，聽候命令。到了這時才如道今晚是演習並不是眞的土匪來到。但是演習也是一樣認眞幹。</p>
<p>朱先生是早已有了打算。他辑日打聽那家有老人，那家有病人，我起初不知道他用意所在。他在弄醒我之前，特别派了幾個人去預先告訴老人家和病人使他們不受驚駭。</p>
<p>黄團長從前對大家講過，土匪有時是西邊放火東邊打刦。一忽兒我們看見對面火起，半天通紅。他們雖派了一些人去救火但大隊人馬，都是胸有成竹。絲毫不爲所動。</p>

<p>以七對六票通過接受</p>
<p>昨晚雙方續商有進步</p>
<p>解决公共租界越界築路之協定草案、經工部局總裁費信惇氏提出上星期三特别董事會討論後、在原則方面、業於當時通過接受、所餘者僅其中某一項、及文字方面略有修改數點、昨晚復經雙方代表、一度磋商、又略有進步、茲將昨日所得消息、分誌於次、</p>
<p>通過交還原則據可靠消息、工部局於上星期三召開特别董事會、討論越界築路之恊定草案時、各董均有相當之意見發表、嗣經一度投票、乃以七對六正式通過接受界外各馬路交還中國之原則、按工部局董事共十四人、總董在平時無表决權、但如遇有董事中一人因意見或其他緣故放棄其投票、而其餘各董所投之反正票、又適數目相同時、則總董得參加一票、是以上星期三特别董事會、除總董貝爾之票不計外、所餘之十三票、適得七對六之通過、</p>
<p>已證實之内容上次新聲社所發表之三項恊定草案内容、卽（一）上海公共租界界外各馬路、完全交還中國政府管理、（二）界外各馬路交還中國政府管理後、關於各該路之警察權、以及其他、亦悉數交還中國政府管理、但工部局鑒於界外各馬路附近居住之外人頗多、雙方同意、設立一特别警務機關、由中政府任命一中國人任警長、同時任命一工部局所同意之外人爲副警長、其下設中外警官若干人、均由中政府任命中外人員分任之、（三）以界外各馬路境内所徵收之各項捐稅、充該特别警務機關、及修築通路等之一切用費、此項稅收之管理、由市政府與工部局共同負責、如遇有經費不足時、亦由市政府及工部局兩方負責平均補充之、以上三項、經多方探詢、業己完全證實、大致無誤、惟其中關於正副警長共同處理中外人士之糾紛事、因與公共租界特區法院協定相抵觸、證實爲不確、　　尙待討論各點該協定草案我方經外交部之批示、并訓令俞鴻鈞工提出三數點修正、現聞業已無甚問題、僅工部方面、尙有要求文字之修改者數點、及某某一項、聞此項極關重要、</p>
<p>雙方昨晚會晤連日因工部局代表費信惇染病、以致未能會晤、昨晨　氏本與俞鴻鈞約定於十時許前往市政府會晤、嗣因費氏　痛、不能出門、乃改下午三時半、在費氏私邸會晤、但下午三時半、費氏仍不能見客、因約定於下午五時許、由工部局總辦　　氏代表費信惇與俞氏晤高、聞其結果、已略有進步云、</p>

<p>公斷不能取消合同</p>
<p>雙方涉訟法律救濟</p>
<p>本埠源安輪局向中威租用太平號輪、至華北裝貨、嗣滬戰暴發、源安欲索還租金、中威以不合事實法理、拒絕所請、乃提公斷、詎源安又推翻公斷案而提出訴訟、已引起上海航業界之反感、蓋恐開此不合理之爭端、則影響於航業至巨、且恐因此而生種種糾紛、今中威亦提反訴、茲詳紀如下、</p>
<p>戰前租船源安輪局因天津有大批煤裝到廣東各地、向中威公司租用太平輪、每月租金本須一萬五千元、因陳順通與趙雲台爲知好、减收一萬三千五百元、太平輪租定赴津、滬戰尙永發生、迨到華北運貨、上海戰事已勃發、然此時沿海商輪、均照常行駛、而遠在北洋與廣東者、更無關碍、而趙雲台乃突然提出向中威解約、</p>
<p>停租爭端源安公司藉口中日宣戰解除租約、請中威退費、中威公司以安源誤引條文、不合滬戰之事實與法理、寗能藉此曲解、而且租去之太平輪、係行駛北洋到廣州、絕不在上海戰區範圍以内、該輪在實際上絕無受影響、則更不能推翻合同、創此惡例、即據理駁復、</p>
<p>航會公斷源安主人趙雲台、乃將此事爭端、提交上海航業公會公斷、航會乃指定肇興總船主陳幹清政記總理王伯芬爲公斷員、開議多次、公斷辦法、（一）上海雖發生戰事、但未正式宣戰、且商輪航行無阻、而本埠各碼頭卸裝貨物、小工又未停、對租船合同、未便取消、（二）兩公司同爲會員、應以感情爲前提、對於已付第二個月租金、未便返還、至第三個月、租金亦不再付、而資結束、且津粤一線更爲安全、無取消合同索還租金之理、</p>
<p>提出控訴趙對公斷之通告、又表示不服、乃復提出用英人馬勒爲公斷員、結果亦如上例、令將第三個月租費止付、趙亦不服、乃請律師藉口因戰事、而將中威壓倒、使可達到解除租約返還租金、但已引起滬航界之不滿、</p>
<p>中威反訴此事發生後、本埠各航商、多主照公斷結束、而自趙雲台控訴後、不啻對於公斷員之主張、認爲違法、因之引起航界之反感、其原因以太平輪旣未行戰區、而在安全航路内運貨、未受絲毫損失、又合同條文含有法理、日人不宣而戰、此等處未能曲解條文、萬一他輪船援例、亦相率不認租金、寗非一髮牽動全局、而强創惡例、今日中威公司已將各種證據檢交所聘之律師準備提起反訴矣</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>中國近來國難日亟，生計日艱，自殺事件，時有所聞，紅葉居士本悲天憫人之志，著述（自殺以後的眞相）一書，勸化大家，根據學理，徵引繁富，語語中肯，允稱佳作，諸君如欲索閱，即附郵票一分，向南洋中學補習科討取可也。</p>
<p>因爲這書，我不覺對於現代表年，發生一種感想，現在我國的青年，的確感覺煩悶，痛苦·無出路，但是此種情形，不但我國的青年如此，即各國的青年，亦何嘗不如此，尤其是我們經濟生產落後的中國，自然是不必說了，惟考求近來青年自殺的原因，不外兩條途逕，一是經濟壓迫，一是戀愛問題，因爲近來一般青年的思想，非常錯誤，以爲人生，祗有住洋房，坐汽車，擁抱摩登女郎，才算不煩悶，才算爲出路，這是大錯而特錯了。</p>
<p>在現在世界上做人·討飯是應該的，做苦力是應該的，咬菜根住矮屋子是應該的，若是住洋房坐汽車，原是一個例外，一個人從困苦艱難中得來的路，才呌生路，用腦筋用精力找尋出來的路，才算生路，若坐擁家產，或享現成事業，吃適意飯，這不敎做生路，這敎做運道，這敎做靠福，即是從前也是如此，古人有句話（大丈夫能屈能伸，）若僅能伸而不能去屈，便算不得大丈夫，看看中外各國歷史上的幾位英雄好漢，那一個不是從奮鬥出來的，若眼前一經挫折，就要去尋短見，尋死路，眞是從前女子所爲，而現在女子所不爲的，古人又有句話，（好死不如惡活）其實眞正惡活，本是無甚意義，因爲天生我人，原不是僅僅敎你來消費麵包的，本來要你來吃苦頭，吃苦頭然後有生路，但是要尋生路·先要學習本領，若不學本領，而坐待幸福的降臨，這就敎做自暴自棄，就是無生路。</p>
<p>至於爲了戀愛問題而自殺，更是一椿笑話，戀愛原是一個適然的機會，今天先碰到甲，便與甲戀愛，今天若碰到乙，便與乙戀愛，難道你碰不到甲就終身無人戀愛么，并且變愛一種東西，原是活動的，可變換的，可移轉的，故戀愛二字根本先不成問題，莫說現在是一個家無担石的中國，即在東西洋各國的青年，若談到婚姻問題，總要在三十歲左右，適符古人三十曰壯有室之說，不過古人主張晚婚，從生理上說的，外人主張晚婚，從生產上講的，因爲滿美的家庭，須要有滿美的經濟來維持，倘若你没有生產的能力，即有摩登女郎，不但得不到戀愛的幸福，先要受着戀愛的痛苦，翻過來說，倘若你有生活能力，怕没有年輕貌美的摩登女郎來遷就你么？若有祖先傳下來遺產的，原是例外，若没有祖先留下來遺產的青年，還是拼命去努力學問、充實你謀生活的工具，先去尋一條光明磊落的出路、且慢慢來談戀愛。</p>
<p>這些話不是在諸位青年前瞎吹，我亦是很有自殺資格的一人，早年失學，專制婚姻，家產毫無，所謂自殺的條件，樣樣備具，但現在活了五十餘歲，還是在世界上奮鬥着，掙扎着，莫說自殺，就是閻王拿了帖子來請，還是要與他奮鬥一下呢！</p>

<h3 id="c195">火酒 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 履霜</p>
<p>火酒是一價醇中最普通的甲醇和乙醇的普通名字；在工業上，日用上，和醫學上的用途很廣，所以現在把牠的製法，性質等討論討論：</p>
<p>（一）甲醇ＣＨ２ＯＨ又名本醇因木品大都把木頭在眞空中加高熱而蒸溜出來的，蒸溜物中尙有醋酸和柏油等；柏油可於重蒸時除去。醋酸可用石灰中和之，使成不溶性之醋酸鈣，剩下的就是百份之八到九的甲醇和水，再用分别蒸溜法把水除去，可得較濃的甲醇。</p>
<p>最近德人用水蒸氣和己在眞空中加熱之煤，使成輕氣和一氣化炭Ｈ２Ｏ＋ＣＨ２＋Ｃo；再以此二種氣體用一種媒介劑並加温至三四百度而成甲醇ＣozH2CH3OH。這方法所得的甲醇，代價便宜，可惜尙守秘密，我們還不能現成應用。還須自己去努力！</p>
<p>甲醇毒性甚大，飲之有性命之危，故只能用於工業和其他非入口的製造。　　（二）乙醇Ｃ２Ｈ３ＣＨ又名米酒，普通的飲料酒中有百份之五十至二十的含量，毒性不及甲醇。最便宜的製法，就是把澱娄發酵，使成糖，再經發酵而成乙醇，我們家庭中做酒釀就是這方法。</p>
<p>乙醇可飲用途較廣。因之在禁酒的國家裏，爲限制飲酒起見，規定乙醇中須有甲醇混入，可免稅出售，否則須科以重稅，所以在市上出售的乙醇中，都有十分之一的甲醇，欲得純乙醇，代價很貴的。</p>
<p>有的藥房往往把已攙入甲醇的乙醇當純乙醇出售，購者不察受害非淺。欲知甲醇有否存在，可用一試管倒入半管酒，再沿管壁倒入濃硫酸，約酒量之三份之一，如是則硫酸沉於管底，再輕輕加入數點三氣化鐵液；如有甲醇，在酒和硫酸二層之間，必有一紫色圈，很是明顯。</p>
<p>現在且來談談火酒的用途：火酒在工業上用爲做各種物品的原料，並用爲水不溶性物質的溶劑。各種香料，都用火酒以提煉。醫學上用途很廣的碘酒，就是碘的酒溶液，還有各種丁幾Ｔincture，都是藥物在乙醇中的浸出物。　　火酒的價值比汽油貴，所以還不能作普通燃料，只可在家庭中應用。</p>
<p>我們中國用火酒的一天多一天，除少數飲料酒外，大都取給於外國，很可惜的事，酒精的製法並不十分難，希望大資本家竭力倡製。</p>

<p>不平之氣總是被一個貧字壓了下來病：是一件最苦的事，尤其是窮人害了病，當然；没有錢去醫治，像這樣的因循，不知枉送了幾許生命！在上海的社會上，雖然設了許多送診施藥的善堂，但是重險的疾病，總是少見功効。所以有大多數本領較大的醫生，不得不大搭其架子，或者不搭其架子，牌子是不能紅的，這也是上海窮人一件不幸的事啊！</p>
<p>下面就是一個窮人診病的一幕：　　是一間醫生掛號室中，來了一個中年婦人，枯黄的臉兒，顯見是營養不足；散亂的頭髮，雙眉是深深鎖着，一件黑布短衫足足打了七八處補釘，顯見是被（貧）壓迫着！</p>
<p>那婦人的胸前抱一個年約二歲的孩子，已是病得差不多皮包骨了，那孩子正放直了喉　大哭，頭上的青筋一條一條漲得很高！</p>
<p>（先生！診金可以减少些嗎？請你發一點慈悲心，救救這個孩子的一命吧？）那個婦人指着抱在胸前的孩子對掛號的說：</p>
<p>（那是不行）！掛號的把眼睛一瞪這樣說：</p>
<p>（這裏是六角錢，今天早上拿一件短衫當來的，請先生行個方便吧）！那個婦人再行苦着臉說。</p>
<p>（你去坐在那裏，等診完了他人再行診你的孩子）。掛號的躊躇好一會兒始行冷冷地回答。</p>
<p>（掛號幾鈿）？一個診客這樣問。（二元四角）掛號的裝了笑容很客氣地回答。</p>
<p>直等到過了幾個鐘點，纔診到那個婦人的孩子。丨最後的一個丨在這幾個鐘點裏，那個婦人看見拔號的是何等迅速，而自己呢！丨最後的一個丨受到了幾個冷酷的面孔，心中是怎樣的難過啊！然而：不平之氣總是被一個貧字壓了下來！</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>乂乂音樂院明天要開演奏會了。葉小姐是本校的高材生，當然被學校當局　爲選手，而且担當了（Ｐiano獨奏）的節目。</p>
<p>的確，她的鋼琴彈得很好，譬如像（Ｓoanta）這一類比較普通的樂曲，早已彈得非常純熟，即如悲多汶的（月光曲），在很久以前便能上手，她預備明天將這名曲在演奏會中一顯身手，於是近天來她簡直不敢離開鋼琴了。</p>
<p>現在她彈了一次又一次，每想及在明天將必然的領受無上的榮譽，便覺得心頭感受莫大的歡愉。</p>
<p>（密司葉！）這是同學的呼喚。（你那新做的禮服送來了，快來試一試罷）。　　於是她急忙走回自己的房間去。　　拖長委地的黑色禮服，穿在她小巧的身上，從背後看去，確是非常動人，然而在鏡中所顯現的那滿臉的褐色斑紋，以及那大而厚並往前突出的嘴唇，就連她自己也覺着羞愧。然而她相信假如運用神妙的化裝術，那是一定可以掩蓋了的；譬如先敷上一層較厚的白粉，然後用（西施敷）在唇邊很適當的描畫，甚至於再將眼眶塗成灰褐色，從遠遠地看去，不也可以對付過去嗎？於是她仍是覺着歡愉。</p>
<p>忽然一個校役走來，說是鋼琴科的主任喚她去有話說。當她走進敎員辦公室的時候，已有幾個同學先在那兒。她走近先生的面前，只見那蓄有滿下巴鬍鬚的前任皇家樂院敎授的現在無國藉的白系俄人在她身上惡狠狠地打　一遍，接上是聳聳肩促着眉頭，停了半嚮，只見皇家敎授扯長着命令式的口吻問：　　（你明天的節目預備好了没有？）</p>
<p>（我想是可以對付過去的。）她滿有信心的回答。</p>
<p>（哼？········）又在她身上打　一遍。又是聳聳肩。幾次嘴唇啓動着總没出聲。最後他决然的說：</p>
<p>（我想你明天還是不必出席罷。）</p>
<p>（啊！爲什麽呢？）</p>
<p>（不爲什麽。······不，你自己會知道的。）</p>
<p>一陣羞怒襲上她的心頭，耳邊還聽着同學們喞喞的笑聲。她頽然的退出房來，她蒙受着極重的悲哀了。</p>
<p>第二天她開始覺悟到（貴族出身的敎授原來如此！）</p>
<p>市場訊</p>

<h3 id="e1">My Humble Opinion on Abolishing the Tael and Changing to the Yuan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The call to abolish the tael and change to the yuan has been around since the late Qing Dynasty's Guangxu period, almost twenty-six or seven years ago. The tael is still the tael, and the yuan is still the yuan, with no effect. Recently, the number of "foreign cents" (small silver coins) and "bottom-of-the-barrel" (inferior) foreign coins has set a new record. Indeed, it is a good time to abolish the tael and switch to the yuan. The financial industry and fiscal authorities intend to take this opportunity to implement the abolition of the tael and the change to the yuan. I hope that China will have a more unified and systematic currency system, and of course, I express my support.</p>
<p>The issue itself is not whether it should be done, which can be discussed. What should be discussed is (1) the method, and (2) the timing. The current methods have not yet been announced, so there is no way to know the merits and demerits. The most important thing is the pricing of the tael and the yuan. Abolishing the tael means that money must be converted into silver dollars according to the pricing. Afterwards, there will be no more "foreign cent" denominations. Those who deposit standard silver hope that the price of silver dollars will be low, so they will use silver to get more yuan. Those who owe standard silver hope that the price of silver dollars will be high, so they use yuan to get less silver. Everyone has their own vested interests. I think we must follow the silver content of the national currency (based on the lowest and most recent one in circulation) and refer to the minting costs and current market prices as the pricing standard, so as to ensure fairness for both creditors and debtors. Then the pricing will not be difficult to decide.</p>
<p>Secondly, is the existing silver dollar enough for national circulation? If it is not enough, we must open factories to mint more. Now that foreign cents are falling in price, many silver dollars with better silver quality, such as Mexican silver dollars, old dragon dollars, and early Yuan Shikai silver dollars, have been destroyed by silver furnaces. If they are not enough in the future, they will still need to be minted. (Although there are many reserves in Shanghai, whether it is enough for the whole country is a question.) Destroying at a low price and minting at a high price, with one going out and one coming in, will cause currency users to suffer a lot. It is also an uneconomical method for the national economy. What if we change the standard in the future and widely mint silver dollars? Wouldn't that be a waste of effort? Last year, I gave a speech on gold and silver issues at the China Society and briefly expressed my views. Now I excerpt them below.</p>
<p>The difficult points in abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan: (1) Minting a large number of silver coins requires a long period of time and a large expense, and the required quantity is extremely difficult to accurately estimate. (2) The use of silver taels has been around for a long time. Old financiers are used to it, and it is not easy to change their habits at once. I want to use a simple method to unify the currency in various places as a temporary transitional currency system. The handling procedures are divided into two phases. The first phase is to abolish the denominations of silver taels in various places and unify them with standard silver. The second phase is to abolish foreign cents and determine the exchange rate between standard silver and silver dollars. There will only be exchange and no buying and selling. Market prices for goods will be calculated in yuan and not in taels. Silver dollars or banknotes will only be exchanged for silver when they reach 1,000 yuan. The central bank and banks designated by the government for exchange will exchange at a fixed price without taking handling fees. The handling fees for commercial banks and private money shops shall not exceed one per thousand. The government only mints subsidiary coins to meet the needs. There is no need to mint silver dollars again. At the same time, two things should be completed in the first phase: (1) Abolish the customs tael; (2) International exchange rates should be priced in silver dollars. Banks that manage foreign exchange should post daily rates, allowing merchants to buy and sell foreign exchange with silver dollars.</p>
<p>The benefits of using this method: (1) It saves the trouble and expense of minting a large amount of silver dollars; (2) Banknotes are not solely backed by silver dollars (silver taels can also be used as cash reserves), making issuance more convenient and circulation easier; (3) Retaining part of the existing habits facilitates implementation. (See sections 5, 11, 12, and 13 of the "Gold and Silver Issues" manuscript for details.)</p>
<p>According to the method quoted above, standard silver exists in name but is abolished in reality. I think it is the simplest and most convenient way to abolish the tael and change to the yuan, and it can be accomplished on schedule. Everything in the world has its advantages and disadvantages. Of course, there will inevitably be many drawbacks. I am very willing to offer my humble advice. I especially welcome corrections and guidance.</p>
<p>As for the timing, of course, the sooner the better. However, the Qianye Guild (Bankers' Association) sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting that (various preparations must be made before a clear order is announced to give the people a considerable period of hesitation). I am afraid that the matter cannot be decided quickly. The timing is related to the method. According to my view, the abolition of the tael and the change to the yuan can be completed in at most ten months. I hope that financiers will not miss this opportunity. (Correction) The two characters in yesterday's comment, "(But in the past twenty years, there have been forty international conferences)" were misprinted and should be deleted. I urgently correct this.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Ministry of Finance Reorganizes Salt Tax <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Approved by the Central Political Council</p>
<p>Song Ziwen Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 11th, Song Ziwen submitted a temporary tax rate plan for the reorganization of salt taxes in the production areas to the Central Political Council, which was approved. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 11th, Song Ziwen issued the following statement on the reorganization of the salt tax: Today, the Central Political Council approved the temporary tax rate plan for the reorganization of salt taxes in the production areas. The purpose is to focus on equalizing tax rates. The method is to slightly increase the tax rates in low-tax areas in stages, and gradually reduce the tax rates in high-tax areas in the future. The neighboring areas in various provinces will be increased or decreased to ensure that they are balanced with each other in order to prevent dumping. Once implemented, the burden on the people will not increase, and tax revenues will definitely improve. However, this method is contrary to the interests of a small number of salt merchants who engage in private salt and improper profits, and they will definitely feel inconvenienced. In the Qing Dynasty, there were more than 400 kinds of salt tax rates in our country, which was extremely complicated. After the establishment of the Salt Administration Inspectorate, gradual reorganization was effective. However, in recent years, the country has been in turmoil, and the troops stationed in various places have added surcharges, resulting in uneven tax rates again. The selling price of salt varies greatly, dumping is increasing day by day, and tax revenue is greatly affected. Taking Shanghai, Nanhui, and Chuansha as an example, the tax rate in the Shanghai Concession is 30.05 fen per picul for the central government's regular tax and local surtax, while in Shanghai, Nanhui, and Chuansha, the regular tax and surtax per dan is 7.1 yuan, a huge difference. In southern Anhui, the regular tax and surtax is 9.1 yuan, and on the western shores of Hubei and Hunan, it ranges from 10.9 yuan to 12 yuan, an even greater difference. To compare the tax rates of the so-called wealthy Shanghai Concession with the poor southern Anhui is even more unexpected. Even the tax rates in the northern salt-producing areas are different, with a huge difference between Changlu and Henan. Therefore, dumping cannot be stopped. Seeing this, the Ministry of Finance is engaged in reorganization in order to gradually equalize the burden and increase tax revenue, which is an urgent task for reorganization. After this reorganization, the direct increase in tax rates by the Ministry of Finance is only 6 million yuan per year. The hope is that the greater effect will be achieved by preventing the dumping of low-tax areas and the high-tax areas. Compared with the salt tax revenue of 170 million yuan last year, the direct increase of 6 million yuan is only 30. It can be seen that the intention of the Ministry of Finance to increase is only to crack down on smuggling. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>(Nanjing) The original text of Minister Song's proposal is as follows: Regarding the proposal, I have found that the current salt tax rates use equal tax laws, and the tax rates in various regions vary depending on their circumstances. When the regulations were made in the past, there was indeed a reason for it, and it was not intended to be high or low. However, with the changes in transportation, the remote areas of the past have become convenient areas today. If the tax rates are very different, it is easy to start the malpractice of dumping. Moreover, all the customs salt taxes in the three northeastern provinces have been seized by the invaders, and the national income is becoming more and more depleted. It is urgent to find other ways to make up for it based on the ability of merchants and people to bear it in order to meet emergency needs. It is proposed to partially reorganize the salt tax. The tax rate in high-tax areas will not be increased, and the tax rate in low-tax areas will be slightly increased. The neighboring areas in various provinces must be balanced with each other so as not to be too different. By doing so, it can not only increase tax revenue, but also prevent dumping. The increased tax rate is relatively small. After the increase, it is still lighter than the current salt tax in the four banks of the Yangtze River and the western Anhui, Hunan and Hubei. Therefore, the burden on various regions is equal, and the malpractice of partial depletion is avoided. It seems to be beneficial to the future of salt affairs and the needs of the country. In addition to the detailed table attached, I respectfully ask you to decide whether the plan to reorganize the salt tax rates in various production areas this time is appropriate.

<p>Analogized to a Chick Just Hatched with Undeveloped Feathers</p>
<p>Strongly Urges the People to be Patient and Refrain from Speaking Arbitrarily</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 11th - General Masaki, Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff, recently traveled to Manchuria for three weeks and has now returned. His remarks have greatly disappointed those who advocate for immediate recognition (of the Manchurian puppet state). Masaki said in an interview with reporters today that the Japanese people lack patience. (The Manchurian puppet state) is no different from a chick that has just hatched. It is wrong for the Japanese to treat this new country as a fully guaranteed country. Masaki strongly urged the people to be patient, saying that it would be enough for the government to appoint a committee to discuss the issue of recognition today. It is important to know that the Manchurian problem is the most complex problem Japan has ever encountered. The people should not speak arbitrarily. He personally is not very optimistic about the outcome of the Manchurian issue.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 11th - This afternoon, the newly appointed Foreign Minister Uchida held an informal conversation with reporters in Tokyo, asking them not to ask about his attitude towards the recognition (of Manchuria), as he cannot say anything about it at present. However, he hopes to be able to clarify it soon. Uchida joked that it would be better if other countries recognized (Manchuria). He then mentioned the proposal by Soviet Russia in January of this year to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan, as he has not had time to consider the proposal, but he will study it someday. It is now expected that Uchida will meet with the League of Nations investigation team tomorrow or Wednesday. It is reported that the investigation team has requested that the content of the conversation not be disclosed to the press.</p>

<p>French and German Cabinets</p>
<h3 id="e57">Pass the Lausanne Convention <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 11th - The French cabinet formally passed the Lausanne Convention this afternoon.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 11th - The German cabinet meeting today unanimously approved the actions of the German delegation at the Lausanne Conference. Given Germany's current situation, even the strongest supporters of the government do not expect the solutions negotiated by Papen in Lausanne to be unanimously approved. This move by the cabinet is tantamount to rebuking Hitler and key figures of the National Socialist Party, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Haswa, Berlin, 10th - Prime Minister Papen and members of the German delegation arrived at this station from Lausanne at 1:42 PM this afternoon. Around ten thousand people welcomed them nearby. National News Agency, Paris, 10th - French Prime Minister Herriot returned to Beijing after concluding the convention in Lausanne. He immediately met with reporters today and claimed that the results of Lausanne were excellent. What we should understand is that the link between the reparations solution and the American war debt issue has now been clearly established, so everything depends on reaching an agreement with the United States in the future.</p>
<p>Haswa, Paris, 10th - The French government is extremely satisfied with the Lausanne Treaty. French political circles say that the results of Lausanne are extremely beneficial to France. Herriot based his negotiations on respecting the treaty, and his opinion was first approved by MacDonald, and in the end, Papen could not but recognize it. Thus, the principle of the inviolability of international treaties was established. Observers say that the Lausanne Treaty must be ratified before it can take effect, but Herriot does not want to ask the parliament to ratify it immediately. The French representatives wanted to closely link the war debt issue with the reparations issue, but this principle was not established at the beginning of the Lausanne Conference. By the time the Lausanne Treaty was completed, the creditor nations signed (a gentleman's agreement), stipulating that the Lausanne Treaty could only take effect after the creditor nations of Germany had a solution to the issue of mutual debts. With this (gentleman's agreement), the principle of linking war debts with reparations was finally established. The reason why the Lausanne Treaty was not immediately requested to be ratified by the parliament is because it is waiting for something. At the time of the negotiations among the creditor nations, they did not agree to completely abolish reparations, mainly because the United States opposed this move. Therefore, if the mutual debts of Germany's creditor nations cannot be resolved satisfactorily, the Lausanne Treaty will not take effect, and the situation will be the same as the situation under the Young Plan before the Hoover moratorium was implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Papen Meets with Reporters <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Says He is Quite Satisfied with the Resolution of the Reparations</p>
<p>Responsibility of Military Leadership Abolished Automatically</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 11th - After German Prime Minister Papen convened a cabinet meeting to report on the final progress of Lausanne, he met with reporters this afternoon, strongly asserting that the German delegation did not consider domestic politics when signing the Lausanne Convention and was not affected by it. The facts have long proven that the Young Plan, which placed a heavy burden of 350 billion marks on the German people, was impossible to implement. However, it is not seen that it is possible to abolish the understandings issued by successive German governments since 1918, or to completely cancel the agreement concluded in The Hague two years ago. As for the assertion that the situation that has arisen in the past two years can be eliminated after Germany abandons the Young Plan, it is known without thinking that this is not the case. Therefore, we believe that the results of the Lausanne negotiations are a significant advance. As for whether it is possible to raise the issue of political issues, a study of history has already relieved Germany of the responsibility of military leadership, so this clause in the Treaty of Versailles has actually been abolished. In Germany's opinion, this clause is abolished automatically after the conclusion of the Lausanne Convention. He had hoped that he could achieve equal treatment and freedom in terms of armaments, but things did not go as planned. He also said that the cabinet unanimously agreed that the German delegation could not take other routes or attitudes in Lausanne. British Prime Minister Returns to London from Lausanne</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 10th - British Prime Minister MacDonald returned to London from Lausanne today. When he got off the train at Victoria Station at around 3:00 PM, all the government officials were at the station to welcome him. Many people also came to the station to admire his demeanor. When he left the station, there was thunderous applause. The British Emperor specially sent his private secretary to the station to convey the Emperor's decree, inviting him to the palace. MacDonald entered the palace for an hour at 5:00 PM. After returning to the Prime Minister's residence, he consulted with doctors and decided that after reporting on various matters in the House of Commons on Tuesday, he should take a rest. The Prime Minister received many telegrams from all over the British Empire, congratulating him on his success in Lausanne. According to official sources, after the Prime Minister reports everything in the House of Commons, he will go to his hometown to rest, as he has been extremely hardworking in the past few weeks. The Prime Minister not only received a grand welcome at Victoria Station, but his special train also had the air of a triumphal return as it passed through southern England. When the Prime Minister landed in England from the ferry, the Mayor and citizens of Folkestone gathered on the shore to express their welcome. When he went from the station to the Prime Minister's residence, there were even more onlookers along the way, and traffic was almost blocked. Reuters, London, 10th - Finance Minister Chamberlain returned to England from Lausanne yesterday and said to guests, "I think we have now obtained what we wanted. Reparations have now been cleared away, and a new era has begun. From now on, old suspicions should gradually dissipate. We are now standing on a solid footing and can take action with confidence to solve the outstanding problems."</p>

<p>Published in the British Labour Party Newspaper</p>
<p>Whether it is True Still Needs to Be Confirmed</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 11th - The Labour Party newspaper, the Daily Herald, published a slightly strange message today, claiming that the Lausanne Convention includes four secret agreements: (1) The UK, France, and Italy agree not to ratify the Lausanne Convention until they reach an understanding with the US on the war debt issue. If an understanding cannot be reached with the US, the Young Plan will be implemented again. (2) To form a united front against the US, guaranteeing that one country will not enter into an agreement with the US that would harm the interests of the other two countries. (3) and (4) The two secret documents stipulate that the payment of war debts from France and Italy to the UK will be temporarily suspended before the Lausanne Treaty is ratified. However, this news has not been verified by other parties, so it is not yet certain whether it is true. Today, the London newspapers expressed satisfaction upon hearing the news that German President Hindenburg and former Deutsche Bank President Schacht both supported the Lausanne Convention.</p>

<p>National News Agency, London, 10th - The British Simonite Liberal Party announced today the formation of the National Liberal Party Committee, with the aim of guiding the national election campaign, consolidating the combination of Foreign Minister Simon and Commerce Minister Runciman's group, and supporting the national government. Its spokesperson recently declared that the committee does not want to compete with other Liberal parties and is purely defensive, serving as a focal point for liberalism. Since the organization of the national government in Britain, the division of political parties has undergone major changes. The Liberal Party is divided into three: Lloyd George's faction does not support MacDonald and is now in the opposition, Simon's faction supports MacDonald and is prepared to accept the tariff system, and Samuel's faction largely supports MacDonald but is prepared to accept tariffs as an emergency solution, while still opposing its principles.</p>

<p>Authorities Send Troops to Suppress</p>
<p>National News Agency, Brussels, 10th - According to recent news from the Belgian coal mining area, the labor unrest is expanding and there is a risk of developing into a revolutionary movement. Several places outside Charleroi experienced major disturbances again last night. Striking workers erected obstacles and cut off telephone, telegraph, electric light, and power lines, plunging the entire area into darkness. The authorities sent troops and police to suppress them, killing one worker and injuring five police officers and nine workers. Striking workers also set fire to the house of a director of a mining company, preventing firefighters from putting out the fire. The situation is still very serious.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Brussels, 10th - Although the strike wave in Belgium has expanded to an alarming extent, the overall situation in the country, except for Hainaut province, is generally calm. However, riots have reappeared in Hainaut, killing one person and injuring many. The Belgian government has sent General Tailleman, commander of the First Army Corps, to Hainaut province to suppress the unrest, granting him the power to use severe measures when necessary. The Socialist Workers' Union has ordered a general strike and will hold a large-scale demonstration in Beijing tomorrow. The authorities have deployed armored vehicles for patrol. It is said that if the disturbances do not stop, the government will declare martial law. Railway workers have decided to convene a national conference of railway workers to discuss the issue of a nationwide strike.</p>
<p>Reuters, Brussels, 11th - A general strike was announced in the Charleroi and Mons coal mines in southern Belgium today, and the situation is dangerous. Those on strike fought fiercely with the police on Friday. The authorities initially dispatched several companies of infantry and cavalry to suppress them, and then sent additional troops yesterday. General Tailleman, commander of the First Army Corps, has been appointed to manage the strike area. It is said that this strike was instigated by the Communist Party. Thirteen Communist Party leaders have been arrested, and documents issued by Moscow have been seized. Those on strike set fire to a factory manager's residence today, turning it to the ground.</p>

<p>Discussing the Draft Resolution Proposed by Simon</p>
<p>Germany Expresses Dissatisfaction with Reintroducing Old Agreements</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 10th - It is expected here that the Disarmament Conference will begin important discussions on Thursday, which may take two or three days to complete. The issue under discussion is the draft resolution proposed by British Foreign Secretary Simon, which includes the points that the Hoover Plan Conference has already agreed upon. Simon has distributed the draft he prepared to the representatives of various countries, and the German delegation seems dissatisfied with some paragraphs. What the German side fears most is the organization of a permanent disarmament committee. As for the draft's mention of previous disarmament treaties and drafts, the German side also considers it unacceptable. The German side said that if it recognizes this provision, it would be tantamount to re-signing the Treaty of Versailles.</p>

<p>The Purpose is to Prevent Capital Outflow</p>
<p>Remittances to Fill Operating Capital are Listed as Prohibited Examples</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 11th - The doubts of bankers regarding the newly promulgated Exchange Law have now been dispelled. Bankers were afraid of unintentionally violating the Exchange Law and requested explanations from officials. The Ministry of Finance clearly stated that the function of this law is to prevent capital outflow and does not want to restrict exchange as in some countries in South America and Europe. Funds for paying loan interest and insurance premiums can be remitted abroad, but remittances for the purpose of filling business capital are prohibited.

<h3 id="e71">The Current State of Decaying Japanese Farming Villages <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch by Qingcun</p>
<p>The long-standing accumulation of corrupt practices in Japanese political parties and government, coupled with the recent global economic downturn, have combined to create the current poverty of Japanese farming villages.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the Japanese government authorities have also formulated palliative relief plans, such as facilitating low-interest loans. However, the result of this facilitation has not only failed to save the farming villages but will also lead them further into decline. The government's method of providing low-interest loans is usually handled by agencies such as the prefectural governments, the industrial and agricultural banks, and credit union federations. Loans are divided into: (1) real estate-backed loans, (2) joint credit loans for ten or more people, (3) village and town bond loans (with villages and towns re-lending to those with joint credit of ten or more people), and (4) group loans to purchasing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives. The regulations and conditions for these loans are very harsh. Therefore, in reality, only some small landowners can obtain low-interest loans, while most poor farmers are rejected because they lack collateral or do not meet the loan conditions. Such relief is ultimately ineffective. Even if poor people are lucky enough to obtain low-interest loans, the funds are actually used for non-productive living expenses and repayment of old debts. Very little is used for industrial purposes. In the end, the more the poor farmers are "relieved," the poorer they become, eventually ending their lives under the exploitation of interest. There are two examples here: (First case) In a village in Tsukui County, Kanagawa Prefecture, a tenant farmer applied to the government for a low-interest loan and received a debt certificate instead of cash. According to government officials, the tenant farmer owed a large amount of village tax and had repeatedly failed to pay. Therefore, the entire amount was deducted when the loan was issued, and the remaining amount was recorded on the debt certificate. This tenant farmer not only did not enjoy any of the small benefits of the low-interest loan but also ended up with an additional layer of interest exploitation. (Second case) In Yamanashi Prefecture, the average low-interest loan is about 50 yen per person. However, some tenant farmers in remote mountain areas had to travel a long way to the prefectural government or an industrial bank branch to apply for a loan, which cost them 20 yen in travel expenses. In the end, when they received the 50 yen loan, they only had 30 yen left. This tenant farmer borrowed 30 yen and had to repay 50 yen. He used 30 yen but paid interest on 50 yen. As a result, the (low-interest loan) was transformed into a (high-interest loan).</p>
<p>Especially in recent years, the average interest rate of Japanese agricultural operations has been less than 4-5%, and land prices have also fallen compared to the past. The government's relief loans, from a financial perspective, are low-interest, but from the standpoint of agricultural operations, they are already extremely high-interest loans.</p>
<p>In addition to low-interest loans, Japanese farming villages also borrow from ordinary banks, mutual aid societies, and individuals (collateralized or credit loans). According to a survey conducted by the Gunma Prefecture Agricultural Association in March and April of this year, there are 118,000 farm households in Gunma Prefecture, with a population of 623,000. The total debt amounts to 93,476,060 yen, with an average debt of 800 yen per household and 150 yen per person. The annual interest rate on this debt is approximately 9.8%, with annual interest payments of 7,130,000 yen, averaging 60 yen and 40 sen per household and 17 yen and 30 sen per person. Conversely, the average annual income of farm households is only 347 yen and 42 sen, which is 512 yen and 98 sen less than the debt and interest amount. This tragic figure is enough to reflect the plight of Japanese farmers.</p>
<p>The heavy exploitation of loans is enough to plunge farmers into a deep hell from which they can never recover, but the reality is not only that. Fertilizer merchants are also squeezing the farmers' blood and flesh.</p>
<p>Fertilizer is a very large expense in agricultural operations. Statistics show that the total annual fertilizer consumption in Japan is 620 million yen (290 million yen for purchased fertilizer and 330 million yen for self-supplied fertilizer), averaging over 50 yen per household. In recent years, agricultural product prices have plummeted, and most farm households cannot repay their fertilizer debts on time. The debt burden is getting heavier and heavier. Here, fertilizer merchants have devised a very clever method. For example, if a farmer owes a fertilizer merchant 100 yen this year and only repays 80 yen by the end of the year, the remaining 20 yen is recorded on a promissory note, with an annual interest rate of 18%. Farmers buy fertilizer every year and defer payments every year. Over time, the amount on the promissory note gradually increases, and the interest becomes larger and larger. Eventually, all of the farmer's property is sacrificed on this promissory note, and the fertilizer merchant becomes rich. In addition, there are fertilizer merchants who usually engage in rice trading. Their method is also very clever. These fertilizer merchants sign fertilizer credit sales contracts with farmers when rice prices are high. The fertilizer payment is not in cash but is based on the rice price. As a result, fertilizer merchants buy rice at low prices and sell rice at high prices. All the profit goes to the fertilizer merchants, and the farmers can do nothing about this illegal behavior. Sometimes, they can only sigh and complain (It's God's doing!) These three words (It's God's doing) are such a painful tune. A large fertilizer merchant in Mito City, Ibaraki Prefecture, is said to have lived in a small house and pulled a fertilizer cart seven or eight years ago, but now he has millions of yen.</p>
<p>Regarding farmers' loans, there are two special methods in Yamagata Prefecture: (1) Winter borrowing, (2) Green rice selling. Winter borrowing is a method of borrowing money in the winter. In other words, it is a method of pre-selling next year's spring cocoons to borrow money from others. Farmers know that this is (suicidal borrowing), but they are forced by circumstances to pre-sell with tears of pain. (Green rice selling) is also a type of collateralized borrowing. It is a method of borrowing money using unripe rice as collateral. The interest on this type of loan is usually 20% per year, plus a 20% handling fee. In other words, for a loan of 80 yen, 120 yen must be repaid. In the end, farmers often find that the price they receive after the rice matures is not enough to pay off their debts.</p>
<p>In short, the current state of Japanese farming villages has reached the point of collapse. However, farmers are living people and cannot be content to fall into a deep pit without a cry. Here, we only need to review the recent number of tenancy disputes in Japan, and it is not difficult to immediately understand that Japanese farmers are struggling and fighting. According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there were 85 tenancy disputes in 1917, 2,052 in 1927, 1,866 in 1928, 2,434 in 1929, 2,478 in 1930, and 2,689 in 1931. Among these rapidly increasing tenancy disputes, the most common are disputes over rent reduction, unpaid rent, and extension of repayment deadlines. As a result of the tenancy disputes, landlords not only do not show any sympathy but also ignite opposition, proposing to return the land before planting. However, how can helpless tenant farmers endure this oppression?</p>
<p>The frequent increase in tenancy disputes has made landlords feel very insecure. As a result, they have sold their land and fled to the cities, while the unemployed masses in the cities are flowing back to the countryside like a rising tide. This movement of people has added another layer of threat to the farming villages. "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and one doubts there is no road, " can be a true depiction of the Japanese farming village today, and the state of "where the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, there is another village" is unknown when it will reappear.</p>

<h3 id="e73">The Civil War Turns Peaceful <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Both Chen's Accept Advice from All Sides</p>
<p>Air Force Officials Do Not Participate in the Civil War</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since Chen Jitang sent planes to bomb the fleet on the Lingdingyang sea area a few days ago, the war to attack Hainan has become increasingly tense. Chen Jitang's army in Leizhou has been deployed throughout Xuwen and other counties. In addition to the six aircraft in the first air squadron assisting in the battle in Xuwen, three fighter planes from the second air squadron led by Chen Shou were also dispatched to Xuwen. On the 27th of last month, Chen Jitang transported 120 boxes of aircraft bombs by land via Yangjiang and other places to the front line in Leizhou. For a time, the Leizhou-Hainan war seemed difficult to resolve. However, after Li Zongren, Cai Tingkai, and others arrived in Guangzhou one after another, they persuaded both sides to cease the war. Chen Ce also listened to the advice of Sun Ke and others and moved the six warships, including the Jiangong, from the Lingdingyang sea area to the typhoon shelter in Hong Kong territorial waters. The Zhongshan warship was ordered to return to Hainan Island (rumored to be heading to Xiamen). On the 3rd of this month, the warship arrived in Haikou. Since then, the air and sea war in the Lingdingyang area has come to a complete end. At the same time, Chen Ce also accepted the advice of the central government and sent a telegram to the central government, clearly stating his attitude. The telegram said: ("To all members of the Central Executive Committee: Reading the telegrams of admonition, I am deeply moved. Unfortunately, in Guangdong Province, at a time when the country is in trouble and the communist bandits are rampant, a sudden incident of naval reorganization occurred. Under the circumstances, I was filled with grief and sorrow. Every time I think of the incessant civil wars in our country, the people are in dire straits, and as a result, foreign troubles are repeatedly invited. If there is any conscience, how can we bear to make another wall-gazing and leave endless disasters to the country? The only thing to do is to retreat the entire army to the coast, strive to suppress the communists, and quietly await the central government's decision. Your enthusiasm for loving the country and sending telegrams to the Central Committee members in Guangdong and Hong Kong to mediate should be accepted with sincerity. I especially ask for timely guidance so that there is something to follow. With the sea and sky in sight, I am deeply moved. Chen Ce bows.)</p>
<p>On Chen Jitang's side, it seems that there has also been a turnaround after Cai Tingkai and others strongly advised him. Cai left Guangzhou for Fujian on the 4th. When passing through Hong Kong, he had another thorough consultation with Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Chen Ce, and others. The mediation between the navy and army may be successful. As for the mediation methods, according to rumors, they are roughly as follows: (1) The Guangdong Navy remains independent and is directly under the central government during peacetime and temporarily obeys the orders of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee. (2) The central government (now the Southwest Political Affairs Committee) selects another officer to serve as the naval commander. (3) Chen Ce is appointed as the chief executive or pacification director of the Hainan Island Special Zone. (4) The navy's arrears of pay are cleared as appropriate. (5) Those who wish to return to their former positions are allowed. The above is just a rumor. The actual conditions are not yet known. According to returning guests from Haikou, Hainan Island, the entire island is currently under martial law. Coastal ports and fortresses have defensive works. In particular, the coastal areas of Lingao, Dan County, and Chengmai in the west are under the strictest guard. Mines are spread throughout Haikou and other ports. The Flying Eagle and Hairui warships patrol day and night. In addition to the four marine corps regiments stationed to guard the land, the Hainan Island Militia Command has recently been organized to reorganize the militias in various counties, specifically to suppress local bandits in the interior. The command has recently been established, and Chen Ce appointed Wu Xiong, the director of instruction for the marine corps, as the director of the Militia Command, responsible for bandit suppression. In addition, a civilian ship team has been organized to assist in the defense of the sea. Each team has 20 or 30 civilian ships equipped with guns. Each ship has 50 marines to assist warships in resisting the enemy. This is the recent situation in Hainan Island during the mediation.</p>
<p>The sudden easing of the Leizhou-Hainan war is due to the mediation of various important figures, but the recent resignation of some key personnel in the air force, indicating that they will not participate in the civil war, has also significantly restrained Chen Jitang's military operations on Hainan Island. It is also one of the reasons. It is estimated that more than a dozen air force personnel have resigned this time, including Deng Yueming, the captain of the aircraft instruction team, Ning Mingjie, the captain of the third aircraft squadron, and Yang Guanyu, the principal of the aviation school. Recently, Chen Xiu, the director of the technical department of the aviation office, also resigned and went to Hong Kong. Since they have resigned, Huang Guangrui, the aviation commander of Chen Jitang, has been hesitant to find talent to fill the vacancies. The air force officials who resigned and went to Hong Kong also issued a joint telegram, stating that they would not participate in the civil war. The telegram stated: ("When external insults are multiplied and communist bandits are rampant, if we do not unite as one, we will not be able to save the country. We once issued a statement that we should not participate in the civil war. I believe that our people have a clear understanding of this aspiration. Unexpectedly, the Guangdong Air Force was recently annexed by those who held military power, and recently, they did not hesitate to become the leaders of the civil war. The air force bombing has turned inward, attacking the people. What crime have the people committed to suffer this poison? Once the killing machine is activated, it is difficult to restore peace. We cannot bear to see this popular force used to abuse the people, and we cannot bear to see this national defense weapon used to harm the country. Since we have reached the point of not participating in the civil war, we will not live in a chaotic country. We resolutely leave, and we will not do anything that will cause internal strife. We will always strive to achieve our initial goal of saving the country. We hope you will understand our intentions. Yang Guanyu, Deng Yueming, Ning Mingjie, Wu Ruliu, Zhuang Dihua, Li Yifei, Lu Jiu, Xu Yanmou, Ye Bing, and all instructors and pilots bow together.") (July 5)</p>

<p>Zhu De Captures Sannan, Peng Bandits Capture Nankang</p>
<p>Bandits Invade Nanxiong and Are Currently in a Standoff</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the 19th Route Army entered Fujian, the Communist bandits in southern Fujian have fled from Zhangzhou and Longyan back to Changting. They have regrouped in the old suppression areas of Yudu, Ruijin, and Huichang in eastern Jiangxi. In northern Guangdong, Chen Jitang, believing that Li Zongren was heading east, mistakenly thought that the Guangxi army was coming as well. He transferred the Independent Third Division and the First Training Regiment stationed in northern Guangdong back to the province, stationing them in the northwestern suburbs, resulting in a defense vacuum. In southern Jiangxi, the garrison consisted of only three divisions and one brigade, distributed between Sannan, Ganzhou, and Nankang, so the strength was weak. The bandits then considered taking the opportunity to invade the south. The bandit army of Peng Dehuai, numbering about 10,000, joined forces with the Li Mingrui faction in eastern Jiangxi and attacked southern Jiangxi in two directions, with Nankang as their destination, hoping to cut off the connection between Ganzhou and Nanxiong. At that time, the Guangdong First Army led by Yu Hanmou stationed in southern Jiangxi had only the First Division and two regiments stationed between Nankang. The Second Division was stationed in Ganzhou, and the Fourth Division of the Second Army was stationed in Xinfeng. When the Peng and Li factions attacked Nankang, the Peng Linsheng Regiment of the First Division stationed in Nankang retreated to the Chijiang area due to numerical inferiority. The First Army then rushed the Zhao Lian Training Regiment and the Li Zhenliang First Regiment from Dayu to Chijiang and Qinglong, engaging in fierce fighting with the bandits, which took place on the 30th of last month. After the bandits captured Nankang, they attacked Chijiang and Qinglong. The Guangdong army had only 5,000 troops and fought the bandits for two days and nights. On the 2nd of this month, the bandits launched another large-scale attack, charging seven or eight times, with more than a thousand deaths. Later, Zhu De led 10,000 bandits from Xincheng, Nankang, to join the attack. The Guangdong side also urgently dispatched the Chen Zhang Second Independent Brigade to Nanxiong for defense. On the 3rd, the Peng, Li, and Zhao regiments of the First Army in the Qinglong area withdrew from Dayu for strategic reasons. The bandit forces became more rampant, advancing to besiege Nanxiong. They met the newly arrived Chen Brigade of the Guangdong side. The bandit army, commanded by Mao Zedong, fought fiercely with the Chen Brigade about ten miles east of Nanxiong City. Until noon, the bandits retreated slightly and remained in a standoff with the Chen Brigade at Huangxu.</p>

<p>Other bandit factions captured Dingnan, Qiannan, and Longnan counties in southern Jiangxi, according to reports, under the command of bandit Zhu De. The Zhang Meixin Fourth Division of the Second Army stationed in the area is currently in a standoff with the bandits in Xinfeng, and the situation is serious. Since the First Army lost Nankang, the First Division and the Second Division have lost contact. It is reported that the Ye Zhao Second Division is still in Ganzhou and has not been able to go south, only waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. The bandit forces are now spreading in southern Jiangxi, and Nanxiong is also in imminent danger. Chen Jitang yesterday urgently dispatched the Independent Third Division, heading north from Jiangcun and Xicun to Xixing and Nanxiong for joint defense. He also transferred the Zhang Da Fifth Division of the Second Army and the Zhang Wei Training Regiment of the Second Army from eastern Jiangxi, immediately heading to northern Guangdong to suppress the bandits.

<h3 id="e76">Han Fuqu Inspects Western Shandong <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Madam Han Accompanies Him to Tour Scenic Spots</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu recently decided to personally inspect the counties of Yanzhou and Caozhou in western Shandong and review the local garrisons. He set off by train on the evening of the 9th, accompanied by Gu Youguang and He Zhiguang from the General Headquarters Staff Department, Meng Guangshan from the Adjutant Office, Zhou Zhenhua from the Public Relations Office, Liu Zisan and Zhao Liantang from the Secretariat, and others. Han was also accompanied by his wife, Ms. Ji Ganqing. They planned to visit the Lingyan Temple and Qufu scenic spots. Xu Jizhuang and his wife, the president of the Central Bank, Lu Tingzhuan and his wife, the president of the Bank of Communications, and He Xiangbai and his wife, the president of the Bank of China, also accompanied him to Qufu, waiting for Shi Yousan. The special train was slightly delayed. The reporter then inquired about Han's inspection route. Han said that the train would arrive in Wande tonight, visit the Lingyan Temple tomorrow morning, and give a speech to various agencies in Tai'an in the afternoon. Due to time constraints, he might not be able to visit Mr. Feng. After visiting Qufu from Tai'an, the bank presidents and General Commander Shi (Yousan) would return to Jinan. He would then go to Yanzhou for inspection, then to Jining, and take a car to the counties under Caozhou, which would take about ten days before returning to Jinan, after which he would go to Beiping. Han then instructed Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie that the recent heavy rains would cause the Yellow River to rise, and the dikes might be in danger. He should make preparations and order the River Affairs Bureau to prepare 50,000 sacks. During the rescue, filling them with earth to dam the dikes would be more effective than straw. Wen replied in agreement. At 10:50, Shi Yousan arrived at the station, and the train departed south. Han's train was the Beiping armored train, engine number 315, with four passenger cars, three flat cars, twelve armored cars, and six iron boxcars, totaling 26 cars. It carried three long-distance buses and two sedan cars. Meng Xiande, the captain of the Beiping armored train, accompanied him. After Han's inspection, the seal of the commander-in-chief was handed over to Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 20th Division, to act on his behalf. However, Sun was inspecting the troops in Jiaodong. Before Sun returned, Cao Fulin, the commander of the 29th Division, acted on his behalf, assisted by Liu Shuxiang, the chief of staff of the General Headquarters. The chairman's seal was handed over to Li Shuchun, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, to act on his behalf, assisted by Zhang Shaotang, the secretary-general of the Provincial Government. All military and political agencies were notified to comply. (10th)</p>

<p>Jiang Arrives in Bengbu to Assume the Post of Garrison Commander</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Jiang Dingwen, the commander of the Second Army, was ordered by the Military Commission to serve as the garrison commander of Bengbu. His military headquarters moved here from Xuzhou on the 8th. Jiang went to Zhengzhou from Kaifeng to attend the dedication ceremony of the Second Army Martyrs Cemetery. He then arrived in Bengbu via Xuzhou at 2:30 this morning (10th). After getting off the train, Jiang took a car to the military headquarters (Chamber of Commerce) and assumed his new position as the garrison commander of Bengbu that day. This morning, the reporter went to interview him. According to him, the Military Commission considered the situation in Bengbu to be relatively complicated. At a time when the campaign to suppress the bandits in western Anhui was in full swing, this area urgently needed to strengthen its garrison. The Xu division of our army has made progress in suppressing the bandits in the direction of Huoqiu. The bandits have been cleared east of the Pi River. The area west of the Pi River is still being cleared. Since I have assumed the position of Bengbu garrison commander, I should do my best to consolidate the defense for the local security responsibility, and so on. Currently, the defense here is the responsibility of the Li Brigade of the Ninth Division of the Jiang Department. Jiang will gather the officers and soldiers of his troops for a speech within a few days, and convene the heads of the various units and military officers stationed in Bengbu to hold a garrison meeting to discuss the security matters related to maintaining law and order. The military headquarters and garrison headquarters of the Second Army are still temporarily located in the Chamber of Commerce. As soon as Chen Tiaoyuan's First Route Army Headquarters leaves Bengbu, it will move to the old site of Fengyangg关. It is reported that the First Route Army Headquarters has decided to move to Huaiyin County, Jiangsu, and personnel and soldiers from various places are preparing to depart within a few days.

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Accepts</p>
<h3 id="e78">Chamber of Commerce Decides on Business Tax Rate <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Government Only Needs Annual Tax Revenue of Six Million</p>
<p>In order to solve the financial problems of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce specially convened a meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members in the province. After several days of discussion, it was finally decided to approve the Jiangsu Provincial Government's proposal to reorganize the business tax, stop implementing other commercial taxes. The business tax rate standard, except for those originally levied at 5 per mille or more, will still be levied as before. Those originally levied at 1 per mille will be changed to 2 per mille, those originally levied at 2 per mille will be changed to 4 per mille. Cotton and silkworm cocoons will be reduced by 1 per mille. Gold and silver jewelry will be taxed based on the amount of capital. It will be implemented from the autumn of the 21st year. Tax payments will be prepaid at the beginning of each quarter. If a store closes down midway, it will be refunded on a daily basis. Furthermore, meetings will be convened by the old prefectural district to announce the constitutional decree to assist government offices in collecting taxes, and to advise merchants to comply with regulations and pay taxes. The above measures were negotiated with the provincial departments by the standing committee members of the association, including Yu Xiaochuan, Wang Jingting, Shi Junqing, and Lan Bohua. The provincial side stated that it could be accepted as long as the annual tax revenue reached six million yuan. As to whether the first quarter after the start of the reorganization should be taken as the standard, the association, in order to tighten the expenditure of the tax bureaus in various counties, also suggested to the provincial departments to appropriately abolish the business tax bureaus in various counties, and the collection matters should be handled by a section set up by the Finance Bureau. Counties without a Finance Bureau can be handled by the county government on its behalf. The provincial side quite agreed with this. (11th)</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Hosts Members of the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Reports on the Progress of Planning Provincial Finances</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce has been holding meetings for days to discuss commercial tax measures. The provincial government specially hosted the members of the association at the provincial government at noon on the 8th, and held talks after the meal. Chairman Gu first expressed his welcome, and detailed the actual situation of the provincial finances, expressing his deep gratitude to the business community for assisting the government in solving the compensation methods. Subsequently, Director Shu, Yu Xiaochuan, Shi Junqing, Wu Minyu, Zhu Dexuan, and others from the Chamber of Commerce successively expressed their opinions. It was dismissed at 3 pm. The following is a record of Chairman Gu's speech:</p>
<p>(Gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce, I recently gathered in Zhenjiang to discuss commercial tax issues. I would like to take this opportunity to invite you all to gather together. I am very pleased. You all have a deep understanding of Jiangsu's politics, and you have a thorough understanding of the financial situation and the principles of commercial tax. At the same time, you are very sincere in seeking assistance in tax collection, which is especially gratifying to the provincial government.</p>
<p>Jiangsu's finances, during the tenure of the former Director Zhang Yongni, had not yet determined a budget. At that time, the total annual expenditure was about 17 million yuan. By the time the budget for the 19th year was established, the annual expenditure was about 24 million yuan. At the end of the year, the resulting revenue was about 7 million yuan short. For the 20th year's budget expenditure, it increased to more than 26 million yuan. Comparing revenue and expenditure, as of December of the 20th year, that is, the first half of the 20th year, it was already 12 million yuan short. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the shortfall will be more than 20 million yuan. We came to serve in Jiangsu at the end of the 20th year. At that time, we already felt the exhaustion of the financial future. At the same time, we examined the income for the 21st year. The only reliable item was the land tax, and other miscellaneous income. The total for the whole year was only more than 7 million yuan. Among them, after deducting various loans for dike construction and military advances, the net balance was only more than 3 million yuan. Compared with the actual expenditure during the era of the former Director Zhang, this small amount of revenue is still 14 million yuan short. Compared with the 19th and 20th years, the difference is even greater, making it impossible to establish a budget for the 21st year. Jiangsu's political affairs will be in a state of stagnation. If the government does not ask whether the source of income is reliable, and simply assumes that the income items are forcibly suitable, the resulting income will only be like a painted cake, while the expenditure must be paid in full. It is inevitable to borrow from the future to make up for the present, with thousands of holes. It is still unavoidable to repeat the mistakes of virtual revenue and actual expenditure in the past, repeating the same old story. Jiangsu's financial bankruptcy will be in a position of eternal doom, which is by no means what those who value the facts believe.</p>
<p>Financial methods are nothing more than two kinds: increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. First, start with reducing expenditure. The government has already strictly implemented austerity. In the current situation, it is really impossible to reduce any more. However, even this current situation cannot have enough income to maintain it. As for the method of increasing revenue, after the abolition of the likin, the annual revenue has suddenly lacked a huge amount, and no method of compensation has been raised so far. Our country is an industrially immature country, and the government's source of income is nothing more than agriculture and commerce. The burden of Jiangsu's land tax surcharge is the heaviest in other provinces. If the burden is increased again, the rural areas will be bankrupt. This is what the people of Jiangsu commonly recognize. As for reorganizing the land tax to seek increased income, it cannot be effective in a short period of time. In terms of commerce, the business tax is the largest item. The previous performance in this province is well known to the people of the whole province. In terms of reorganization, if we rely solely on any method of the government, it is difficult to hope for a quick effect. Since income cannot be increased dramatically, and expenditure is difficult to reduce any further, the finances for the 20th year have actually fallen into a desperate situation. The economy is the mother of everything. Since the finances have fallen into a desperate situation, then Jiangsu's political affairs will be paralyzed in every way. We Jiangsu people are responsible for governing Jiangsu. Not only can we not seek positive development, but we cannot even plan negative maintenance. We are deeply concerned about the future, and we are all deeply self-reproachful. After thinking again and again, in order to avoid the stagnation of political affairs, we have no choice but to reluctantly seek to remedy the insufficient portion of this year's income. It is estimated that the insufficient amount, in addition to seeking assistance from the central government and raising other methods, can obtain about 5 to 6 million, and there is still a difference of 6 million yuan. This difference can only be met by two methods: opening up new taxes or reorganizing old taxes. Opening up new taxes, no matter what method is used, will inevitably increase the burden on the people. The people of Jiangsu are declining, and it is difficult to bear. Moreover, we are unwilling to do so. This is well known to the provincial government. As for reorganizing the existing business tax, the past effects have been as described above. If we start reorganizing, if there are no special methods, we are still worried that it will not be effective in the shortest time. When the need is urgent, and the difference in quantity is so great, in order to urgently seek compensation, we have no choice but to take effective methods. Therefore, we have the plan to try out a special business tax. We know that the nature of this tax law is similar to the likin, and we are afraid that there will be abuses in the future. Therefore, after repeated consideration, and after detailed consultation with the central government, the reason why we have not immediately started is that we are also working hard to find a proper solution, seeking a win-win situation. Now that you all believe that the government and businesses should cooperate closely to urgently reorganize the business tax, and that the annual income is expected to reach 6 million yuan, the government only asks that it can meet the required amount and establish a budget. There is no fixed and unchangeable prejudice. Since you are willing to be responsible for assisting as much as possible, in order to have a dramatic increase in business tax revenue, we can abandon the original proposal to handle special business tax. In addition to the business tax rate and reorganization methods being properly planned and handled by the Department of Finance, we hope that you will uphold your original intention of assisting the government, and do your great strength to persuade and support, so that it becomes a correct and reliable income. However, after this business tax has been reorganized, if the result of the first quarter's income can reach 1.1 million yuan, then the annual income can be inferred from this, and the income budget can have a considerable percentage. In case the income number cannot be as we predicted, we will still have to rely on you to continue to assist and continue to find ways to compensate in order to maintain the budget for the 21st year, so as not to cause Jiangsu's political affairs to fall into a state of stagnation. This is the concern of the entire political life of Jiangsu. Not only is it the private concern of I and my colleagues. Today I hastily invited you, and the hospitality is simple and crude. I am very sorry. Please give me more guidance. I look forward to it very much.</p>
<p>Director Shu reported on the financial situation, and stated the reasons for the proposed special business tax, and the methods for reorganizing the business tax in the future. The general idea is the same as what Chairman Gu said.</p>

<p>The tooth tax contractor came to Songjiang to open the county's tooth tax. It has always been levied concurrently by two counters, and the amount collected is less than ten thousand gold. It was taken back by the Finance Bureau for self-management, and actively reorganized. The collection number last year was still good. This tax is offset against the provincial education expenses. After the collection, it must be sent to the Jiangsu Education Expenses Management Office. This year, the Education Expenses Acceptance Office solicited bids from merchants to increase tax revenue. Sun Ming, a merchant from Nanhui, won the bid with a tax amount of 13,000 yuan. He came to Songjiang yesterday to take over from the Finance Bureau, and is now looking for a house to open, and will start collecting immediately.</p>

<p>As the Green Screens Rise, Lake Bandits Swarm Since the beginning of summer,</p>
<p>the tall grass grows luxuriantly in the Taihu Lake area, as if green screens rise. Large gangs of lake bandits hide in the tall grass, making it difficult for police teams to suppress them. As a result, bandit alarms occur from time to time in villages along the lake. Water Security Section Chief Shen has personally</p>
<p>On the 10th, six or seven bandit ships arrived, carrying sixty or seventy bandits. Fearing arrest by government police, they soon left. Twenty-odd lake bandits also arrived in Hengta, purchasing cigarettes, rice, and other supplies in town before leaving. In addition, on the 10th, thirty-odd lake bandits arrived in the Zhoujia Dang area of Wulong Bridge, Suzhou Township, plotting wrongdoing. Upon learning this, Water Security Eleventh Squad immediately dispatched a team to suppress them, but the bandits had already fled upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Entanglements Arise from a Young Woman's Devotion to Chastity Ma Baolin, the young master of Ma Yuanji Silk Shop, residing in Hulong Street, and his fiancée Xu Caizhen, due to neglecting their studies and wandering about, were scolded by their father. Both simultaneously committed suicide by poisoning. Discovered by family members, Ma died from severe poisoning, while Xu was saved. This matter has stirred Suzhou City. Now, the parents of both sides are suddenly engaging lawyers to legally resolve the issue of contract cancellation. Ma's side believes that since he has died, the marriage contract is naturally canceled, and they intend to entrust the original matchmaker to return the betrothal gifts. However, Xu Caizhen firmly wishes to maintain her chastity for Ma. Xu is only eighteen years old and has already donned mourning clothes, preparing to observe mourning at the Ma family. The Ma family firmly refuses. Outsiders are curious about the complex and tortuous nature of the inside story, which is actually just a property issue. Yesterday, Xu hired lawyer Zhang Taitan, who published a solemn declaration in the newspaper, stating that if the parents of both sides do not understand, she would have no choice but to seek death again.

<p>Selling an Adopted Daughter into Prostitution Is Punished Yin Xiaoshan, from Rugao, Jiangbei, has been in Wuxi for over ten years. He had no daughters, so he adopted Chun Di as his adopted daughter. She is now fifteen years old and has been working as a spinning girl in the Zhenxin Yarn Factory outside the West Gate, going out in the morning and returning in the evening, and everything was peaceful. Later, Xiaoshan recruited Wang Huichun as his son-in-law, but they were not yet married. On May 20th of this year, Xiaoshan had bad intentions and colluded with Ma Renlin, Xia Zoushi, and others to trick Chun Di into going to Shanghai and sell her into the Hongyunfang Fulu brothel, obtaining a dowry of 320 yuan in foreign currency. After returning to Wuxi, he gave 80 yuan to his son-in-law Wang Huichun as a condition for breaking off the marriage contract. Huichun refused to accept it, so Xiaoshan used iron chains to imprison him at home and beat him in private. The day before yesterday, Yin Xiaoshan demanded 40 yuan from Ma Renlin and Xia Zoubing unsuccessfully, so he twisted Ma and others into the first branch of the Public Security Bureau under his jurisdiction, accusing them of abducting and selling his adopted daughter Chun Di. After the preliminary hearing by Director Gao, he was sent to the County Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, Section Chief Zhang held a court hearing. Ma Renlin confessed that Wang Xiaosan, a car driver from Puren Hospital, was also involved in the case. Zhang then summoned Wang Xiaosan to the case. According to him, Chun Di was actually tricked by her father Yin Xiaoshan into being sold into a brothel in Shanghai. Section Chief Zhang was very angry when he verified the confession. Yin Xiaoshan went back on his word, sold his daughter himself, and falsely accused others of selling her. He was really harmful. He immediately presented the original case to the County Court for punishment according to law.</p>

<p>Reaction to Chen Jianyou's Replacement of Principals</p>
<p>The undercurrent of education in Jiangxi Province erupted uncontrollably on the 8th after the announcement of the principals of provincial middle schools and above. The principals who were replaced were Li Caibin of the Industrial College, Zeng Zhonglu of the First Middle School, Chen Yingchun of the Fourth Middle School, Long Shudu of the Fifth Middle School, Lv Rigui of the Sixth Middle School, Tu Gang of the Seventh Middle School, Liu Heng of the First Girls' Middle School, Ma Shouzhen of the Fourth Agricultural School, and Zhang Hao of the Pottery Industry. The reaction was swift after the announcement was made. Education Director Chen Jianyou became the target of public criticism. The First Middle School is the largest in scale, with annual funding of over 130,000 yuan. Chen suddenly appointed Zeng Zhonglu, who was not familiar with the education community in Jiangxi, as the principal, and transferred the original principal Chen Yingchun to the Fourth Middle School. Zeng had been appointed as the director of the Mass Education Center last year, but resigned because he heard that the center had little funding. As a result, the faculty and staff of the First Middle School and the students who stayed on campus during the summer vacation petitioned the provincial government to retain Principal Chen. That day, Chen happened to be participating in the elementary school graduation exam award ceremony, and was surrounded and almost beaten. The Industrial College and other schools also had petitions. This was related to the replacement of principals. The abolition of the Second Girls' Middle School in Ganzhou and the integration of classes into the Third Middle School further angered the female community. On the 7th, they went to the Education Department and surrounded Chen, giving him unbearable treatment. Chen's abolition and merger of various schools and replacement of principals were not without reason, but the faculty and staff believed that education was a planned undertaking. Not only did it affect their livelihoods, but it also led to the degeneration of education. Therefore, the opposition was firm, which was beyond Chen's expectations. Because Chen planned to set up two independent normal schools, one in Nanchang and one in Ganzhou.</p>

<p>(7) The Relationship between the International Olympic Committee and the Far Eastern Athletic Association</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee and the Far Eastern Athletic Association have the same goals, and the methods they use to achieve these goals are also the same, and both have been successful for many years. There should be a close relationship between them. The scope of the Olympic Committee is the entire world, but the opportunities for the development of sports in various countries around the world are quite unequal. It is not easy to achieve the realization of universal sports. Therefore, the Olympic Committee's ideas must have a development mechanism, must maintain the highest standards of amateur sports, and must promote universal sports as its purpose. As for the training of sports stars, it is accidental and not due to promotion.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Athletic Association is a relatively young organization. It is no less than a child of the Olympic Committee. It has learned a lot from the Olympic Committee. For example, the order of the Far Eastern Games is as far as possible in accordance with the Olympic Games, except for those limited by the circumstances of each country. The current conference schedule has been changed to be held once every four years, and it is held in between the Olympic Games to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>The original name of the Far Eastern Athletic Association was the Har Eastern Olympic Association. The western name of the Olympic Committee is Olympic Committee. Later, at the request of the Olympic Committee, the word Olympic was not used, and it was changed to the Far Eastern Athletic Association.</p>
<p>The current relationship between the two associations is not out of compulsion. The Olympic Committee does not restrict the Far Eastern Athletic Association, nor does it infringe on its privileges. The Far Eastern Athletic Association can therefore increase its reputation and influence through this relationship, and at the same time make the Olympic Committee have wider contact with the world's competitive situation. The Olympic Committee sends a commissioner to each Far Eastern Games as a special envoy, and appoints a famous athlete in each related country as a special representative of the Olympic Games to guide the events of the Far Eastern Games and promote its development.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the Far Eastern Athletic Association, it was quite popular with the Olympic Committee.</p>

<p>丨Germany and Italy Show Their Colors</p>
<p>Win the Last Two Singles</p>
<p>Win the European Final</p>
<p>丨Austin and Sato Similarly Out of Form丨</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th - The result of the Davis Cup European Zone semi-final was very unexpected. Germany eliminated England three to two, and Italy defeated Japan three to two. In the two singles matches on the third day, England and Japan both failed completely. England and Japan both took a two-to-one lead on the second day.</p>
<p>Austin Completely Defeated In the battle between England and Germany in Berlin, Austin, the main player who won the Hui Bo Erden finals, did not win any of the two singles matches against Germany. He lost to Polen on the first day, and lost to Clam today. Panlai easily defeated Clam on the first day, but lost to Polen's fierce draw and heavy serve today. Panlai lost two sets in a row, and tried his best to counterattack, but was only one step away from a tragic defeat. The results of the two groups are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Clam (Germany) 5-7, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 Austin, England)</p>
<p>(2) Polen (Germany) 6-2, 6-4, 3-6, 0-6, 7-5 Panlai (England)</p>
<p>Japan's Sato is Completely Defeated The same thing happened in Milan. Italy won all two singles matches and reversed the defeat into victory. Encouraged by the members of the Webber Committee, Professor Wm. Sloano, AV. Ormous, and F. J. Wendell, a golden wreath was presented to the Far Eastern Games as one of the trophy prizes. However, the Olympic Committee did not officially recognize the Far Eastern Games until 1920. The reason for the delay was the European War, so it was not that it did not approve or pay attention to this new international organization. That year, when the Olympic Committee held a regular meeting in Antwerp, E. S. Brown represented the Far Eastern Athletic Association and presented its objectives and achievements in detail. All the members fully agreed and decided to send Kano Jigoro as the official representative of the Olympic Committee to participate in the Far Eastern Games held in Shanghai in 1921. At that time, Kano was the only Far Eastern member of the Olympic Committee. At the opening of the 5th Far Eastern Games, he delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Olympic Committee, explained the situation at the Antwerp Conference to the Far Eastern Games, and reported the results of the Shanghai Conference to the President of the Olympic Committee, Gubadin.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1922, Count Peirandra de Coubertin, Vice President of the Olympic Committee (the current President), served as a special envoy and traveled from Europe to the United States to participate in the First Latin American Games held in the capital of Brazil in September. He also planned to go to Osaka, Japan to participate in the 6th Far Eastern Games in May 1923. His trip to South America was quite worthwhile. After the meeting, he traveled to various countries in South America to inspect the situation of physical education. He originally planned to travel around the Far East and finally to Osaka, Japan. Japan was also actively preparing to welcome him. However, when Pei was about to depart from South America, he suddenly received a telegram summoning him back to Europe due to important matters, so he did not make the trip. This was a great disappointment to the Far Eastern Games. Later, the President of the Olympic Games, Gubadin, expressed the hope that Dr. Wang Zhengting, the new member of the Olympic Committee, would represent the Olympic Committee at the 6th Far Eastern Games. However, Wang was unable to attend due to the critical nature of the Sino-Russian incident. Kano Jigoro was still representing the Olympic Committee in reading a congratulatory telegram at the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>After Japan's Sato, who reached the final four, won the doubles, the two singles matches were as completely defeated as Austin's. Stepheni's victory over Sangyuan was expected, while Palmeri suddenly surprisingly defeated Sato. Sato ran around in the last three sets, not knowing what to do. After the match, Sato was out of breath and exhausted and lost. The results of the two singles matches are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Stepheni (Italy) 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 Sangyuan (Japan)</p>
<p>(2) Palmeri (Italy) 4-6, 4-6, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 Sato (Japan)</p>

<h3 id="e108">The Despotic Monkey <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Most of the despotic countries in the world should be disappearing now. The revolution in Siam has been successful, and one more despotic country in the world has weakened.</p>
<p>A friend suddenly remembered a story about a despotic monkey after hearing me talk about despotism. According to him, he read it from the "Miscellaneous Records of Lingnan." I don't have this book on my desk, but I'll write down what my friend said:</p>
<p>In a certain mountain in Lingnan, there is a kind of despotic monkey, named Velvet, which is twice the size of an ordinary monkey and has golden fur. It is known as the demon king among monkeys. It usually feeds on apes and monkeys. When the Velvet wants to eat a monkey, it lets out a long roar, and the monkeys gather together after hearing the sound and kneel in front of the Velvet. The Velvet then examines each monkey for its fatness. The fatter ones pick up a small stone and put it on the monkey's head, and the monkey dares not move. The Velvet then lets out another long roar, and the rest of the monkeys all leave, but the monkey wearing the stone respectfully follows the Velvet to the river, washes itself in the water, and then plucks its own fur to make it clean. After plucking, it lies naked on the ground, allowing the Velvet to feast on it. The despotic magic power of the Velvet is so great!</p>
<p>After listening to this story, I sighed for a long time.</p>
<p>It's not a fable. Aren't there despotic demon kings like Velvet in the world now? The pitiful remnants of Jizi have become monkeys with stones on their heads, providing a feast for the demon king. The demon king, not satisfied with eating Koreans, wants to eat my compatriots outside the Guan. All the people who are willing to be devoured by the demon king are actually not people, but have become weaklings providing food for the strong.</p>
<p>Why did General Ma, who rises again and again, resist to the end? He was afraid of becoming a monkey with a stone on his head!</p>
<h3 id="e109">Ma Zhanshan and Feng Zhanhai Outside Shanhaiguan <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Cai Zhi</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident in Northeast China, half of our country has been occupied by foreign countries for a long time. The day to return my invaded land is nowhere in sight. Fortunately, Black Chairman Ma Zhanshan and Jiyi Army Feng Zhanhai were the first to raise the banner of righteousness and resist the strong enemy with all their might. He healed the wounded and supported the weak, and raised his arms and called out to strive for the last five minutes and make a desperate gamble. Success or failure is difficult to predict, but the prestige is enough to shock people. Don't say that there is no one in Qin. Make them fear Shu like tigers. What is strange is that Ma is named Zhanshan and Feng is named Zhanhai. One is to show the remaining courage of Fu Bo and mark the bronze pillar for long-term existence, and the other is to rely on the legacy of the big tree to consolidate the golden cup forever. Heaven and man respond, and the names and treasures are consistent. He will wield a hundred thousand horizontal grinders and hold three thousand Mauser rifles. He will travel as fast as a meteor, and encompass everything. He will restore all the land, people, and politics outside the three Guan, across the Bai Mountains in eastern China and the Liaohai Sea in northern China, to my nation, and return my sovereignty, and occupy them all. In the past, someone had a couplet saying: "Those who have the will will succeed. Break the cauldrons and sink the boats. The one hundred and twenty Qin passes will eventually belong to Chu. Hard work will not be in vain. Lying on firewood and tasting gall. The six thousand Yue armor is enough to swallow Wu." Know what to strive for. Don't be discouraged.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Physiological Oddity <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Sent by Peng Licheng from Nanchang</p>
<p>Recently in Nanchang, a strange physiological anomaly occurred, causing a sensation in society. Various newspapers raced to report it. The matter is so bizarre that I am recording it for this column for research purposes.</p>
<p>In Fengcheng County, more than a hundred miles from Nanchang, a young newly married couple, on their wedding night, naturally indulged in marital bliss, fulfilling the duty of marriage. Unexpectedly, upon their initial exploration of paradise, they lost the freedom to separate, as if experiencing a kind of attraction like that in physics. Although both tried to separate, they could not succeed. By daybreak, after being discovered by family members, they were sent to a local hospital for treatment. Due to the lack of skilled doctors in the area, no one dared to make a diagnosis without caution. They were then taken to the Saint Church Hospital in Nanchang City, known for its reputation, for treatment. However, the hospital found this kind of physiological anomaly quite unprecedented and felt very perplexed about the treatment. Besides surgical separation, there was no other method. Therefore, with the consent of both sets of parents, surgery was performed. However, before the surgery, the hospital declared that only one of the two could be guaranteed safe; otherwise, it was beyond medical capability. As a result of the operation, the male was fortunate enough to be safe, but the female, due to being beyond saving, died tragically in a pool of blood. It is said that from the wedding day to the day of surgery, nearly a week had passed. During this period, their bodies were closely connected, and even urination and defecation could not be separated at all, flowing down their legs, which was indeed a bitter situation. Now, after hearing the news, medical professionals in Nanchang have flocked to the hospital requesting public observation. However, the hospital doctors stated that such a physiological anomaly is rarely heard of, and there is a lack of research on treatment methods. As for performing surgery, it was out of necessity, so they have not agreed to public observation. One wonders if there are many good Chinese and Western doctors in Shanghai who can explain the reason for this.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Taste of Plums <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>I am fond of plums. Others who see me eat them find their teeth ache and their mouths water, and they avoid me as if I were a plague. But when I eat them, I find them quite delicious. Indeed, the Compendium of Materia Medica lists their medicinal value, and the Treatise on Various Flowers and Fruits even has a discussion of cooking plums. This shows that plums, as a food item, simply haven’t been studied. If someone with a scientific mind were to utilize them, they could certainly become a good food product, greatly benefitting human life.</p>
<p>This year's plum harvest is more abundant than last year’s. People commonly refer to this as a ripe year. In truth, there was little snowfall last winter. Even the plum trees of Luofu and Yuling Mountains, which prefer warmth, have ancient trunks in famous gardens and old temples that are twisted and sparse, but covered with fruit. It is not just our county that has this phenomenon. Last year, a catty could be sold for a dime, and the demand still exceeded the supply. Now, only four or five copper coins can be obtained per catty, and yet no one inquires about them. The disparity is quite great. Moreover, due to the war, sugar prices are too high, and the weather is mostly overcast and rainy, so there are even fewer buyers. In the past, people thought plums were easy to cultivate, and planting them was simple. Those who first promoted them as excellent garden plants would say, "Plums three, peaches four," meaning plum seedlings would produce profit after three years. Now the opposite is true. It is not known that the practical uses of plums are extremely broad. Since their value is low, it is a great pity to let them go to waste.</p>
<p>During the time of avoiding the war, I went to Zhuxi and saw shops selling pickled plum skins. At first, I found it strange. Later, I inquired with a gentleman there and learned that it was a local specialty. I bought some and ate it; the taste was very good, but it was too sweet, and the original flavor was lost. The so-called “clear water” (pickled) plum was not its true flavor. Each year, sales of these pickled plums, while not a major commodity, generate significant profits. It made me think that the most common food product using plums is dried tangerine peel plum. But now, those who make this substitute other ingredients because of the profits involved, the name is correct, but the substance is not. If one has a sense of taste, one can distinguish the real from the fake with just one taste. In fact, the manufacturing method is extremely easy. Try using 100 catties of plums, 10% edible salt, place them in pottery, making sure they are evenly distributed. After about three days, add fresh water to reduce the salty taste. Then drain the water and soak the plum embryos in a 50% sugar solution for about a day. The acidic taste will gradually disappear and neutralize with the sugar, making it delicious to eat. The uses of this are far more extensive than plum sauce, plum paste, plum candy, plum cakes, and dried plums, plum jam, as well as cold noodles, cherries, and pudding. The additional ingredients only require licorice, cloves, mint, ginger powder, and star anise. Adding lemon or a small amount of fragrant powder to blend it further enhances the taste. Our county’s plum production is later than elsewhere. If we could manufacture it during the plum ripening season, it would also be a good household item for clearing heat and preventing foulness.</p>
<h3 id="e112">A Record of the War Zone Relics Painting Exhibition <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Kang</p>
<p>There are many people who have taken photographs of the relics of the Shanghai War Zone. Few have captured them in paintings. Before the armistice, Japan had already sent famous painters Wada Sanzo, Okada Saburo, etc. to Shanghai by the army and navy authorities to paint many works in situ. These were then taken to Tokyo for exhibition. After the armistice agreement, our country only then had the famous painter Wang Jiyuan personally request Mayor Wu to introduce him to Yin Yilin, Chairman of the troop withdrawal and takeover committee, to issue a certificate. He began to paint the ruins in Jiangwan, Zhabei, Wusong, and Baoshan, braving wind and rain and intense sun. After repeated difficulties, Wang created dozens of watercolor paintings, which are truly valuable.

On the opening day, Wang Jingqi impromptu composed a seven-character quatrain, inscribed in the Jiyuan commemorative album, containing the line: “Recalling the setting sun on the ruined walls, each stroke of the brush accompanied by a tear of blood.”</p>
<h3 id="e113">Worth Introducing National Goods Factories (3) <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>(4) Type Foundries</p>
<p>The type used in printing factories is mostly purchased from type foundries. There are dozens of these type foundries in Shanghai. In addition to the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, etc., the Huafeng Type Foundry on Renji Bridge is the largest. Newspaper offices such as Shen Xin, etc., in addition to casting type for their own use, can also sell it to others.</p>
<p>The most important part of type is the matrix. The quality of the type is often determined by the depth and uniformity of the engraving on the copper matrix, as well as the neatness and elegance of the font. Most of these matrices used to come from Japan. In recent years, Chinese people have also been able to manufacture them. There are more than a dozen such factories in the whole of Shanghai, the most famous being Wang Zhen's in Zhabei. However, it is still a step behind Japanese goods. Therefore, when large printing houses and newspapers need matrices, they still mostly purchase them from Japan. It is hoped that craftsmen in this industry will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Type is divided into two types: high and low. The high type is called the "continental style" and uses the German typeface as the standard. The low type is called the "island style" and uses the English and American typeface as the standard. Therefore, buyers must specify which type they want; otherwise, the type they buy will be different in height from the existing type and cannot be typeset. However, Chinese type mostly uses the island style. Western type varies from company to company, so buyers must pay attention.</p>
<p>When manufacturing type, first install the matrix in the type casting machine, then adjust its height and match it with the type case. Old-fashioned type casting machines are hand-cranked, with each crank producing only one character. The characters produced all have tails, which must be removed. Then a small planer is used to plane it smooth, and a grinder is used to polish it before it can be used. New type casting machines are driven by motors. The characters produced can be used immediately without planing or grinding. A hand-cranked machine costs only a hundred yuan or so. An automatic one costs ten thousand yuan. The best automatic type casting machines are the Kesmen factory products managed by the German firm Taylor in Shanghai. American products are second best. German machines can produce typefaces from number one to number seven, casting three to four thousand characters per hour. American goods cannot cast as many as seven types. Old-fashioned hand-cranked machines can only cast a hundred or so characters per hour, a difference of almost twenty times. It was previously heard that the Jianye Machinery Factory in Zhabei, our country, had already begun to imitate German goods, but before it was completed, it was burned to the ground by war. It is regrettable.</p>
<p>Type is sold by the pound, with each pound costing thirty to forty cents. Smaller typefaces are more expensive. The lead used for type casting is all foreign goods. If it were made entirely of lead, the type would not be strong and durable. A little copper, tin, and antimony must be added. Approximately 3% copper and tin and 7% antimony.</p>

<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu (The Man Who Does Not Weed His Courtyard)</p>
<p>Fifty-two</p>
<p>I feel that my bell-ringing duty has become even more meaningful during these times. Life in the ancient temple seems inextricably linked to the sound of the bell that I strike. Take the military and martial arts training, for example; it cannot do without the bell. We don't have trumpets or bugles. This large bell has taken their place, performing the task of issuing commands. Because everyone is working hard, I am also ringing the bell with energy. However, the farmers say that because I am ringing the bell with energy, they are working hard. Most likely, both sides are right: working hard makes one ring the bell with energy, and ringing the bell with more energy makes one work even harder.</p>
<p>Tonight, Battalion Commander Huang, Mr. Zhu, Company Commander Jiang, and Master Zhang secretly decided to issue an emergency assembly order at midnight for a night battle drill. No one else in the entire village knows this secret. Even I don't know there will be such a charade tonight. The emergency assembly order is three loud, rapid strikes of the bell. Whenever this kind of bell sound is heard, everyone must immediately jump out of bed, grab the weapons they are responsible for guarding, and run to their designated locations to await orders. Those who are absent or late without reason, or who forget to bring the weapons they are responsible for guarding, or who run to the wrong locations will be severely punished. At eleven fifty, they dragged me out of bed, wanting me to strike this emergency assembly bell, which I had never struck before. Although this was unexpected, I had long anticipated it. How happy I was! As soon as the bell rang, wives pushed husbands, sisters-in-law shouted for uncles, older sisters called for younger brothers, and mothers called for sons, all saying that bandits had arrived, get up quickly! Everyone, according to the distance from their homes, in three, five, seven, or ten minutes, arrived at their predetermined positions, awaiting orders. Only then did they realize that tonight was a drill and not a real bandit raid. But the drill was still carried out as seriously.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu had already planned this out. He had been inquiring which families had elderly people and which had sick people. At first, I didn't know what he was up to. Before waking me up, he specially sent several people to inform the elderly and the sick in advance so that they would not be frightened.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Huang had previously told everyone that bandits sometimes set fires on the west side while looting on the east side. Suddenly, we saw a fire break out on the opposite side, half the sky was red. Although they sent some people to put out the fire, the main force remained calm and composed.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Gold Price Plunges Over Eight Taels <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The falling trend is very strong. Yesterday, the benchmark gold price continued its downward trend, almost breaking the 750 tael mark. However, the market situation was complicated, and the mentality of the industry turned downward. Throughout the day, there was a fluctuation of 14 taels. Finally, the total drop was eight taels and change. Initially, it was peaceful, and the silver price rose slightly, so it did not have an impact. However, seeing that there were many buyers, it should have trended upward. However, the cashiers of various firms diverged, and the exchange rate was flat externally but weak internally, so the price immediately dropped. There were occasional bounces of two or three taels. As the exchange rate hardened in the afternoon, and the selling pressure increased, the market price continued to decline, finally falling to 750 taels. In the end, it fluctuated between 53 taels. The details of the market situation before and after are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning market was mild. The opening price for August fell by only four qian to 761 taels. Large bars rose by only 3/16 to 1/8, and American silver rose by only 1/8. Moreover, the exchange rate recovered by only 13/16, so people's minds were still calm. Then, Hengxing, Zhifeng, Yongyuanmao, Yongheng, Yufu Xingyong, and Bingxing took the lead in buying. Also, because the silver company bought $75 American gold for October and Shanghai offered half a yuan for August, and Huayin Bank made an interbank transaction of £1.78125 for July, the gold price gradually rose by about three taels. However, there was an instantaneous one-tael rally to 63 taels and 8 qian at 9:15. At that time, Tongtaichang, Xiexing, Yongheng, Yu, and others sold, so September American gold could be settled at 62.25 taels, immediately falling back to 61 taels and 9 qian. The British gold price was announced unchanged, at 62.23 taels. Chengda, Yongbingxing, and others bought, immediately going to 63 taels and 1 qian. Later, Dalian, Bangtong, Taichang, Zhifeng, Yongheng, and others unloaded, and the American gold loosened. Mitsui offered $68.75 for September, so the price immediately went downstream, only reaching 59 and a half taels after ten o'clock. Later, Yuanmao, Yonghengxing, Hongkang, Yongqian, Changxiang, Yifengyong, and others covered their positions and Shunli and others bought, and Huabi sold August American gold for half a yuan to HSBC, so it added another three taels, reaching 62 taels and 8 qian at 10:45. After that, the exchange rate hardened even more, with $62.5 for August settlements. In particular, Fuxingyong, Richang, Zhifengyong, Yuantaiqian, Changxiangyuhe, and small investors inclined to sell. Plus, British gold was traded at 8 pence in October, so the gold price plummeted by six taels, with occasional rallies of a few qian. At 11:45, it was only 56 taels and 8 qian. Later, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yonghengchang, Yongpin, and others bought, adding two taels, reaching 8 taels and 8 qian at noon. However, Yifengyong and others sold, dropping to 8 taels and 2 qian. The noon price closed at 8 taels and 4 qian, again making it to 9 taels and change.</p>
<p>The afternoon gradually weakened. The market initially opened at 58 taels and 8 qian, then from 8 taels and 6 qian to 8 taels and 9 qian. Then, Fushunyuankang, Xiangdaxingyong, Yifengyong, Fuyu Xiexingyong, Richang, and others sold, so the price fell by four or five taels at one time, reaching 54 taels at 2:15. Almost any purchase or sale of British gold for this month at 8 pence was possible. Moreover, the American gold gradually loosened and became flooded. Hengxinghongkang, Yongyuanmaoyong, Tongtaichang dragged in, pulling it up by two taels, reaching 6 taels and 3 qian. After 2:30, the falling trend became more intense. Qianchangxiangheng, Xingyuanhengyufushunshunli, and others were constantly unloading. The British gold was particularly hard. HSBC offered 1.25 for August and Shanghai offered 2.5 for November (Xiexingyong bought). Moreover, the industry sold 3.75 to the bank for November. The market seemed to be in a slump. By 3:15, it finally reached 50 taels. Soon after, Zhengjin and others absorbed $3.75 of American gold for November, Mitsubishi entered $1.8375 of American gold for November, and Yifeng bought it, immediately bouncing back two taels, reaching 52 taels at 3:30. Then it fell by a little over 1 tael, then Daxingyongfuyuanmaochunyuan and others bought again, reaching 3 taels and 2 qian at 4:00. However, Yifeng then released it, falling back to 2 taels and 5 or 6 qian. Later, Tongtaichang and retail investors bought, and those who had sold before covered their positions. This was because they were not holding overnight, which caused the market price to rise again by one tael and three qian, reaching 53 taels and 8 qian. However, the market closed at 4:30 at 53 taels and 3 qian, down 8 taels and 1 qian compared to the fourth day of last week. In short, people's minds were weak, and there was more and more cash. The banks did not open up. Over the course of the day, the maximum price was 63 taels and 8 qian, and the minimum price was 50 taels, with a total fluctuation of 13 taels and 8 qian, which was not uncommon. The premium still added 7 taels and 75 cents.</p>
<p>The posted price was mostly suppressed by eight taels. The posted price was still 828 taels. The listed price did not change. The discount was 65-66 taels to 70 taels, and 70 taels to 78 taels in the afternoon, then 75 taels, a discount of eight taels more than last Saturday. The exchange had a double-closing price, with the front market closing at 58 taels for July and August, and the back market closing at 53 taels, with a supplementary water price of 56 taels, and 51 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The transaction was not lonely. Trading on the trading floor was still lively. However, the cash flow was inconsistent. According to statistics, Yuanmaoyong, Chengdayong, Shunhe, Tongchun, Hongkangyong, Yuanxingyong, Yuankangxiang, Hengxing, Bingxing, and Yifengyong all bought. Tongtaichang, Yuhe, Yuantai, Fuxingyong, Futaiheng, Xiexingyong, Richang, Zhifengyong, and Daxingyong all sold. Hengyu and Dadecheng, etc., had different entries and exits. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Tongtaichang, Yuantai, Yuanxingyong, and Yuanmaoyong all bought. Shunli, Wanxing, Hongkangyong, Tongchun, Zhifengyong, Hengxingyuan, Fushun, and Xiexingyong and Richang all sold. Futaiheng, Hengyu, Daxingyong, Yifeng, etc. sometimes bought and sometimes sold. Dalian Bang bought over 400 bars and sold over 1,000. The Guangdong Bang bought over 800 bars and sold 200-300 bars. The total number of bars for each firm was about 21,000.</p>

The Hong Kong exchange rate continued to fall by .025, totaling 78 taels. However, the British, American, Indian, and Singaporean exchange rates did not change. The prices of bank transactions suddenly became loose and overabundant, especially the British gold exchange rate. Dong was affected by the rising situation in the London market.

As a result, compared to last Saturday, the British gold exchange rate increased by .375, and has returned to 8 pence.

<h3 id="e119">The Interest Rate Is Gradually Improving <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Monday. The banks were open, and the situation in all aspects seemed more energetic. However, transactions involving foreign currency were still sluggish in the market and not as prosperous as last week. There was a lot of silver received and delivered, and transactions involving silver dollar pledges were also less weak than before. However, there was still no news of lending. After this concentration of cash, it would not be easy to circulate it in the short term.</p>
<p>The interest rate split has consistently increased (Foreign interest rate). The early market interest rate was 6 qian 9 fen 4 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half, an increase of half a li compared to the early market the day before. The noon market improved by 1 hao 2 hu and a half, reaching 6 qian 9 fen 5 li. (Silver split) The early and noon markets were the same at 6 fen, an improvement of 3 fen compared to the day before. The market price for markups with water was 1 qian and 8 or 9 fen.</p>
<p>The auxiliary currency, copper coins, violently contracted. Jiangnan small dollars were 6 qian and 5 li in the early market, an increase of 2 li compared to the day before. 5,000 jiao were traded. Because there were no transactions in the noon market, the price was the same as the early market. Guangdong small dollars were 5 qian 8 fen and 8 li in both the early and noon markets, an increase of 7 hao and a half compared to the noon market the day before. 90,000 jiao were traded in the early market, and 20,000 jiao were traded in the noon market. Copper coins violently contracted by 9,000 wen, totaling 416,000 wen. It was heard that the source of trams was scarce the day before, so the market transaction volume was only over 20,000 strings, which was half of the usual port.</p>
<p>Silver dollar collections were slightly more prosperous (Silver currency). Yesterday the bank opened and the collections news was prosperous. Hua merchants collected over 3 million in bills, foreign merchants collected 2.3 million-2.4 million in bills, foreign merchants' pledge transaction were 1 million and Hua merchants' were 780,000, plus various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous items collected more than 10 million and strong, 1 million in warehouse deposits, and private money houses' and silver public units' collections 29 million, markup payment collections four and a half million, various remittance collections 700,000, and 1 million cash (Foreign currencies: the early market for drafts and bills was 580,000, and the noon market was 625,000.

<h3 id="e120">Fluctuations in Securities and Bonds <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Minor Ups and Downs, Quiet Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained extremely sparse in terms of spot transactions. Only 12,000 yuan were traded throughout the day. The futures market was also very sluggish. The atmosphere among buyers and sellers in the market remained very cold, with no improvement compared to the previous week. The total turnover was 660,000 yuan in the morning and 855,000 yuan in the afternoon, totaling 1,515,000 yuan. Among these, salt taxes accounted for 400,000 yuan, while most others were only around 200,000 yuan. The whole lot of the Sixth Consolidated, legacy customs, and 1929 customs bonds each had only several tens of thousands of yuan in transactions. The trend for all bonds indicated no change in market conditions. People's sentiment remained as cold as before, so the market was extremely quiet. Supply and demand remained balanced, and the prices of various bonds did not change significantly as a result. Although there were slight fluctuations of a few cents, they were only determined by the temporary supply and demand in the market and did not show a consistent trend. As a result, compared to the end of last week, there were mixed ups and downs, with amounts only around two cents.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the New York stock market saw improved sentiment due to the results of the Lausanne Conference, leading to a good start and strong prices for various stocks. Public bonds were even better, with particularly strong demand for German bonds. However, the market was significantly affected by a large number of sell orders for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) stock. Subsequently, the rise in shipping stocks reversed the situation, but it gradually weakened again. By the close, the Dow Jones average of three types of stocks was slightly better than Friday's, with a few points increase. However, AT&amp;T stock set a new record for the day, having fallen 13.5 points in the past three weeks. Overall, the current stock market situation is not as bleak as before, as both international economic relations have improved and several commodity prices have rebounded, which is enough to dispel some of the pessimistic sentiment. The only factor that currently affects people's sentiment is the development of the unemployment relief plan. Attached is the Dow Jones index as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e122">Short Selling Dominates Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is generally weak, and the market atmosphere is relatively calm. People's sentiment is weak again due to the decline in American cotton, and short sellers are active again. Actual sales are decreasing, not as enthusiastic as the previous day. However, most of the goods for July and August from various factories have been purchased by the Yunnan and Guangdong groups, so some have higher expectations. Rongxing's long positions remain unchanged. In general, financing is still tight, and the rising power of standard yarn is weak. The Sichuan group purchased more than 10,000 bales in Hankou. Recently, the exchange rate has eased, and the group is more active.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Weak: The standard yarn market opened weak due to the weak American cotton, and people's sentiment was also weak. Prices for all months fell by six, seven, or eight cents. In the afternoon, prices for all months fluctuated by one or two cents. The total turnover for the day was 29,200 bales.

<h3 id="e123">Cotton Market Under Selling Pressure <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, and the downward trend is intensifying. American cotton, which had been rising continuously, turned down due to good weather, causing scattered long positions to become unsettled and liquidate, leading to a further decline in the market. This is a completely speculative effect. In the afternoon, the gold market trended down, and people's sentiment softened even more. However, most profitable short sellers bought in to cover their positions. The sales of spot cotton in the market remain sluggish. The future of the cotton market depends on the movements of American cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Falls by Five or Six Cents: The Zheng Standard market opened weak. American cotton trended down, and selling pressure was strong in the market. Prices for all months fell by four or five cents. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere remained weak due to the decline in the gold market, falling another five cents to two cents. The total turnover for the day was 90,400 piculs. Hengyi sold 4,600 piculs, Suilong 2,600 piculs, Gengfeng 2,000 piculs, Shenchang 2,500 piculs, Changfeng 4,100 piculs, Xincheng 2,200 piculs, and Changhe 6,300 piculs. Yuanda purchased 5,300 piculs, Tongxing 3,100 piculs, Xiesheng 2,600 piculs, Yiyu 4,700 piculs, and Ruida 3,900 piculs. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>December Futures 30.85 60 138,100</p>
<p>Total 648,600</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Mills' Demand is Completely Cut Off: Transactions of spot cotton have stopped because the downward trend of cotton futures has intensified, and demand is even lower. No transactions have been made.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Indian and English Cotton Sales Were Quite Healthy Last Week <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Although the exchange rate in Bombay was unfavorable last week, Japanese merchants continued to purchase. There were no significant purchases from Europe. Local factories had substantial demand, mostly for White Broach, Dhollerah, and Hinganghat cotton. Due to high cotton prices, yarn factories set prices for cotton cloth and cotton yarn, but there were no profits to be made. The panic in the cotton region at the end of last week was canceled due to the resumption of monsoon rains in the west. There was rain in the Oomra district. It is expected that other areas in need of rain, such as Kathiawar, Gujarat, Central India, United Provinces, and Punjab, will also receive beneficial rain. The parity between Indian and American cotton is slightly larger, and Indian cotton may have a huge appeal. The statistics for last week are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1931 1932</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1 3,279 1,949</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 854 826</p>
<p>Cumulative exports since September 1 2,221 847</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 550 129</p>
<p>Shipped to China 192 201</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 1,250 481</p>
<p>Other regions 24 36</p>
<p>Spot sales in Liverpool improved last week. Futures were quite active due to optimism about the war debt plan and rising silver prices. Later, the Lausanne Conference succeeded, and the US cotton government report was favorable to long positions, leading to higher market prices. The market softened at the weekend due to good weather in the cotton region. Although there were long position profit-taking in Egyptian cotton, it still rose along with American cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Gradual Progress in the Grain and Rice Market <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, about twenty-three or four boats of rice from the Fuzhou group arrived in Shanghai South, slightly reducing the inventory in Puxi. However, the sales in urban and rural stores were sluggish due to the hot weather and the continued weakness in the northern market. The opening price of thick Japonica rice suddenly fell by two cents. Although there was not much early and late rice, sales were slow, and prices were also slightly lower. The price of foreign reed pointed rice was also weak.</p>
<p>The rice market in Shanghai North was extremely quiet yesterday. The number of people coming to the market in the morning was very small, and the situation was sluggish. The top-grade Changshu Northern Japonica rice remained unchanged. Medium-grade old rice decreased by two cents. Demand for early and thin double-crop rice was low, and prices were slightly lower. There were few Yin Yuan-denominated goods and sales were small. The market was stable. Twenty or thirty boats arrived from the west road, with about 2,000 stones of river-bottom rice.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Imported Rice Continues to Fall Slightly by One Cent <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Fuzhou Group Trialed a Batch Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, imported rice continued the weak trend from last week, and demand from both local and out-of-town customers was low. Prices continued to fall slightly by one cent. Yesterday, the Fuzhou Group trialed 500 bags due to a slight rebound in market prices. Zhenjiang and local mainlanders bought 2,000 bags, stabilizing the market slightly. However, transactions were sluggish again in the afternoon, and there was no improvement in the outlook. Moreover, the inventory is still sufficient, and new shipments are arriving continuously, making it difficult to reverse the situation in the short term. A total of 2,500 small bags were sold throughout the day, priced at 9 yuan 5 cents to 36 cents. In addition, 147 bags of Jiangxi Yuan rice were sold locally, priced at 13 yuan 9 cents 8 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Flour Market Only Improved in the Last Three Rounds <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a sluggish trend for a while after opening in the morning. Quotations for imported wheat were slightly lower by one or two cents. Transactions both inside and outside the industry were quiet. The nearest month even reached eight cents at its lowest, and the far months were also lower by about five-thousandths of a cent. However, large factories did not sell, so people's sentiment remained calm. By the afternoon opening, the market was still stagnant for the first three rounds, and transactions were even rarer. In the last three rounds, the market atmosphere improved because the Tianjin Group had some spot flour activity, and customers and long positions frequently bought in. Observing this situation, with the current low prices, it is still difficult for a significant turnaround to occur. As a result, the nearest month was better than the previous weekend by 2.5 thousandths of a cent, August was better by 7.5 thousandths of a cent, September was better by 1.5 cents, October was better by 1.25 thousandths of a cent, and November and December were better by 7.5 thousandths of a cent. The Tianjin Group purchased 20,000 bags of paoche flour, priced at 1 liang 9 qian.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Both Near and Far Futures of Standard Wheat Are Sluggish <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Factories Purchased 5,000 Bags of Spot Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market generally showed a weak trend in both the morning and afternoon after opening. Quotations for imported wheat were slightly lower by one or two cents. The Wuxi wheat market also fell by more than one cent. The highest-grade goods were no more than 5 yuan. Therefore, although sales were not very smooth, people who were speculating were inevitably concerned due to the poor environment and low spot prices. Therefore, both near and far periods were sluggish. As a result, July to October were each lower by two cents compared to the previous weekend, and November and December had no comparison. The spot wheat market was still good, and high-grade goods also saw an increase. Kaiguzhen wheat was priced at 3 liang, Changzhou wheat at 2 liang 9 qian, Wuxi wheat at 2 liang 9 qian 3 cents, down to 8 qian 3 cents, Danyang wheat at 2 liang 8 qian 7 cents, Huangbo wheat at 2 liang 6 qian 4 cents, Kunshan wheat at 2 liang 8 qian 1 cent, Penglai wheat at 2 liang 8 qian 3 cents, Zhitang wheat at 2 liang 8 qian 4 cents, Taicang wheat at 2 liang 7 qian 8 cents down to 7 qian, Lujiabang wheat at 2 liang 8 qian 6 cents, Shuangfeng wheat at 2 liang 7 qian 6 cents, Anting 2 liang 8 qian, and Zhitang wheat at 2 liang 8 qian 3 cents.

<p>Among the dried lychees produced in Zhangzhou, the early red lychees are the first to enter the market. According to reports, the first batch has already been transported in by the Hairui ship from Xiamen, totaling thirty-seven boxes. It is currently being cleared through customs and should be available for viewing today. If the goods are pure, the market price should be above that of Shuidong lychees. Moreover, the quantity is not large and will definitely be reasonably priced.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market at the Sugar Merchants Association's market had even fewer transactions, and the market atmosphere was even more weak. The transaction price for Dutch No. 24 raw sugar was 14 liang 3 qian 7.5 cents, Hong Kong goods were 14 liang 2 qian, No. 18 medium raw white was 13 liang 8 qian, Dutch red Nos. 8 and 9 were 10 liang 7 cents 5 qian, No. 10 was 11 liang 2 qian.

B mark was 16 liang 3 qian, CW mark was 15 liang 8 qian, PY mark was 15 liang 5 qian 5 qian, and Japanese mark was 12 liang 5 qian. Sales in various places were not smooth, and the local market was even more quiet, so the market situation was particularly bleak, but the base price was quite firm.</p>
<p>Raw Silk Prices Fell as Factories Purchased Another 500 Taels of Customs Silk</p>
<p>The price of B2 raw silk required by the silk merchants was only 450 taels in the overseas market. Purchases of raw silk by factories were still sluggish. In addition, the frequent contraction of foreign exchange led to a sharp drop in silk prices again. The telegraph price in Lyon, after conversion, fell by another 500 taels. Yesterday, although there were raw silk negotiations at French companies and others, the opening price for SF grade 13-22 denier was only 480-490 taels. Even the price of B grade raw silk required by silk merchants was only 450 taels, and transactions were even more scarce.</p>
<h3 id="e131">New York Raw Silk Sales Greatly Reduced <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Less than 40,000 bales last month: Japanese silk accounted for 76%</p>
<p>New York has many silk weaving factories, and the annual consumption of raw silk requires more than 50,000 bales. Since the global economic recession, the sales of silk have plummeted, and the consumption of raw silk has greatly reduced. The consumption of silk in the last month (June) totaled only about 38,000 bales, a reduction of about 30%. Japanese silk accounted for 76%, and the remainder was from China, Austria, Italy, France, and other countries.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Both Red and Green Tea Transactions Were Scarce <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no large transactions of red and green boxed tea from various routes in this port. The inventory of top and medium-grade goods of Keemun black tea is currently lacking, and sales of low-grade rough goods have not yet started, according to reports from London. Therefore, there have been no transactions in recent days. The demand for Ping-shui green tea remains sluggish. The market for Lu Zhuang and Tu Zhuang Zhenmei teas is also quiet. Only Zhenmei and Xiumei varieties are frequently purchased by Jardine Matheson and Hehe, and the market price is able to remain stable.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Metal Plate Tin: Shantou Merchants Made Large Purchases <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the prohibition order, the trade in tinplate has been quite sluggish, as tobacco factories and printing factories have successively stopped operations. The market is quite cold, and the outlook is extremely pessimistic due to the continuous dumping of spot goods by foreign companies. In recent days, Shantou merchants have suddenly started to make purchases, so the number of transactions has been unusually large. It is estimated that a total of more than 2,000 boxes were shipped out yesterday. The price of 90-pound British goods was sold for 9 liang 7 qian 5 cents, 100-pound for 11 liang 7 qian 5 cents, 90-pound American goods for 13 liang, 100-pound for 14 liang 8 qian, and 200-pound goods for 22 liang. According to those who trade in this commodity, the rainy season will soon be over, and various factories have a tendency to continue purchasing, so the market outlook may have a chance to rebound.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Huang Bingheng Hosts Banquet for All Sectors to Discuss Aviation to Save the Nation <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Huang Bingheng, Director of the Aviation Administration, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. At 7 pm yesterday, he hosted a banquet at the Bankers' Association, inviting leaders from all sectors to discuss matters related to the Aviation to Save the Nation Association and to plan for expanding aviation projects. Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Li Fusun, and dozens of others attended. During the banquet, Director Huang delivered a speech, saying that during the Anti-Japanese War, domestic civil groups and overseas Chinese had requested the National Government to quickly establish an Aviation to Save the Nation Association to lead the people and assist the government. The National Government then ordered the aviation authorities to adopt public opinion and coordinate methods. Since the Aviation Administration was instructed to handle this case, it sent its specialist committee member, Lin Wojang, to Shanghai a few weeks ago to visit everyone, explain the reasons for organizing the Aviation to Save the Nation Association, and solicit opinions. He was grateful for everyone's support. He was very happy and came to meet everyone in person for further consultation. He hoped that the Aviation to Save the Nation Association could be established soon through the efforts of both sides, so that the public and the government could have a fully cooperative center for aviation and air defense. The organization law of the Aviation to Save the Nation Association, the future direction, and the steps to be taken are entirely hoped to be determined by social leaders. If there is a need for aviation experts to participate in discussions, the Aviation Administration will order them to offer advice for adoption. As for the draft charter of the Aviation to Save the Nation Association prepared by the Aviation Administration, it only represents the government's perspective and the concept of the Aviation to Save the Nation Association. It is still desired to wait for everyone to discuss and determine it at a meeting. Whether the board of directors is organized automatically first and then the charter is submitted to the National Government for record, or the charter is first submitted to the National Government by the competent authority for promulgation and then directors are appointed, is acceptable. The draft charter can be regarded as a reference material. The origin of the Aviation to Save the Nation Association is roughly like this. As for its significance and the necessity of this organization, I would like to briefly explain one or two points. The air force is definitely in the most important position in today's strategy because (1) war has evolved from a plane to a three-dimensional space. In the past, offense and defense were limited to land and sea, but now the solution of victory or defeat depends on the sky. Therefore, fortresses that were regarded as natural barriers in the past are almost equivalent to illusions. (2) In the past, the targets of attack were the enemy's military buildings and front-line combatants, but now the air force constantly crosses the battle line to attack civilians in the rear and material construction outside the battlefield. Therefore, innocent people and prosperous areas cannot avoid being destroyed together. During this anti-Japanese war, our side suffered severe damage from the enemy's air force. Therefore, the organization of the Aviation to Save the Nation Association can be regarded as a new understanding of the government and the people after this violent suppression to find a way out. In other words, we have recently understood the value of the air force in strategy and fully understand that unless we combine the strength of the government and the people to seek to develop our country's aviation industry, then with a few dozen aircraft that are not fully equipped, resisting the enemy's air force, which is a dozen to dozens of times more powerful, destruction can be expected immediately, let alone resistance. Today, our country's authorities may not know that expanding the air force is an urgent task. In the past two months, the government has slightly increased the aviation budget. The Aviation Administration is also making great efforts to expand the aviation school to train air force personnel, rectify the aviation factory, and enrich the various aviation teams. However, due to the lack of financial resources and talent, it is ultimately difficult to promote. Looking at the urgent situation in Guanwai and the increasingly fierce banditry in the Central Plains, the development is limited by strength, and the encroachment of foreign aggression is unpredictable, and I am truly concerned. Fortunately, many civil groups at home and abroad understand the overall situation and work together to enable our country to form a powerful air force in the near future. I am willing to take the responsibility of carrying out the task together with leaders from all parties with full enthusiasm. However, since the majority of the directors of the Aviation to Save the Nation Association are representatives of people from all parties, the direction of the project should be controlled by the board of directors. Aviation is a powerful tool for national defense, so there must be a strict review of policies and strategies and a complete plan. This is the government's inescapable responsibility. In the future, how much the public wants the air force to develop, how to raise funds to facilitate the project, and how the government plans and budgets for national defense can all be used as a center for exchanging ideas, gathering ideas, and taking action. The establishment of the Aviation to Save the Nation Association and the cooperation between the government and the people will be realized. Subsequently, Huang discussed the progress of the association with various dignitaries and did not disperse until 9 o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Municipal Government Prepares for Autonomy <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Minutes of the Preparatory Committee's Two Resolutions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Autonomy Preparatory Committee was established on the 1st of this month and held its first meeting at the Municipal Government. The following seven committee members were present: Yu Hongjun, Wu Xingya, Yang Nianzu, Xu Peihuang, Luo Jingyou, Wang Zhijing, and Shen Tong. Yu Hongjun chaired the meeting. The meeting began with a report by the chairman on the progress of the municipal autonomy preparations. This was followed by a report from Committee Member Wu on the steps for preparing autonomy, and a report from Committee Member Xu on the progress of district demarcation work. After the reports, the following resolutions were discussed and decided: (1) Pass the committee's procedural rules; (2) For the selection of the heads of each group, the Secretariat will send personnel for the General Affairs Group, the Public Security Bureau will select personnel for the Investigation Group, and the Social Affairs Bureau will select personnel for the Election Group. The list of names will be sent to the chairman for appointment and reporting on the following day; (3) Yu and Shen will be delegated to compile the committee's budget; (4) The Public Security Bureau will be requested to order each district office to submit a report on changes in the wartime household registration to the committee within one week, after which it will be decided whether to re-demarcate the districts; (5) The meeting date for the committee will be set for every Friday at 10:00 AM. Because there was no suitable location for the committee office, it was temporarily located in the Municipal Government Building. Several rooms have now been located in the Diplomatic Building and the office moved there yesterday to officially begin work. The second meeting was held at 3:00 PM yesterday. All committee members were present except for Luo Jingyou, who requested leave due to business, and Wu Xingya, who was represented by Huang Baoshi. Yu Hongjun chaired the meeting. The subject of discussion was the progress of the Investigation Group's work, and a detailed discussion was held based on the draft plan prepared by the group. It was also resolved that when conducting household registration surveys, the investigation of voter qualifications should also be emphasized. For the investigation of those who have committed crimes and been deprived of their civil rights, a letter has been sent to the Shanghai courts requesting records to be sent to the committee for review. A decision was also made to conduct a household registration survey in the Special District within a set period, but the method has not yet been determined. The Investigation Group's work plan is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Set up district boundary markers to demarcate the city's autonomous districts. The previous district demarcation committee, based on the number of registered households in July of the 19th year, and based on the number of households re-examined as the standard, with the exception of the four districts of Huinan, Zhabei, Yangjing, and Yinxiang, where ten households form a neighborhood and ten thousand households form a district due to special circumstances, all other districts are demarcated in accordance with the Municipal Organization Law, with five households as a neighborhood and five thousand households as a district, dividing the city into forty districts, and detailed maps of the district boundaries have been drawn. For the convenience of the work, boundary markers (such as the boundary of a certain district) will be made for these forty districts (including the war zones) and nailed at the boundaries of each district to facilitate investigation.</p>
<p>(2) Investigate household registration. Although the city's household registration has been investigated and sampled by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, due to the city's rapid changes, which are unparalleled in the country, there are bound to be changes and errors. These should be investigated immediately to avoid disputes during elections. The methods are as follows: (1) After the district boundary markers are nailed, personnel will be sent to each area to investigate each household to avoid omissions. (2) After completing the investigation of one street or one village, continue to process the household registration register and send personnel to re-examine it, and it must be checked against the Public Security Bureau's master register of household registration changes. If there is any doubt, it should be investigated immediately. (3) After the investigation is completed, statistics should be compiled separately in order to start dividing neighborhoods.</p>
<p>(3) Investigate boundary changes. In the demarcation of the city into forty districts, if there are special circumstances in the number of households in each district, each district should not exceed 10,300 households at most, and at least around 90 households, with the remainder being based on 5,000 households, not exceeding 6,000 households. However, the number of households in non-war zones such as Huinan and Yangjing has been increasing, while the number of households in war zones such as Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Yinhang, and Zhenru may decrease. However, the boundary of other districts should not be affected by the change in the number of households in a small number of districts. The proposed methods are as follows: 1. In areas where the number of households has increased, the previous number of households can still be used as the standard, and the increased number of households will be incorporated into adjacent areas where the number of households has decreased. 2. Areas where the number of households has decreased can be merged depending on the number of households decreased.</p>
<p>(4) Survey and examine district boundary maps. After the household registration investigation is completed and the district boundaries are demarcated, the area should be measured immediately and detailed maps should be drawn for examination.</p>
<p>(5) Handle household registration changes. After the household registration investigation is completed in a district, citizens often change their place of residence. Personnel should be sent to manage this to ensure accuracy. There are two methods to choose from: 1. Send personnel from each sub-office to manage it specifically. 2. Or it can still be managed by the original household registration officers in each district of the Public Security Bureau. When there are changes, the sub-office should be notified daily for correction and reporting to avoid confusion over time.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Japanese Troops in District D Repeatedly Delay Withdrawal <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun Asks Ke Nanninghan to Expedite the Process</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in District D and the Gongda and Toyota textile factories have not yet withdrawn. The two Chinese members of the Joint Committee, Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing, have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, but have not received a satisfactory reply. Committee Member Yu Hongjun formally sent a letter to Ke Nanninghan, chairman of the Joint Committee, requesting that the Japanese side withdraw as soon as possible. Subsequently, Ke invited the Chinese member Yu Hongjun and the Japanese member Okazaki to meet at the US consulate on the morning of the 6th to discuss the matter. As a result, Okazaki agreed to give a definite reply to the Chinese side within three days regarding the date of withdrawal of the Japanese troops from District D. As for the Japanese troops in the Gongda and Toyota textile factories, they will be withdrawn successively after the withdrawal from District D is completed. However, the agreed deadline of three days passed the day before yesterday, but there was no reply from the Japanese side. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Committee Member Yu Hongjun yesterday to inquire about this matter. According to Yu, the Japanese member Okazaki promised to reply within three days when he met with him at the US consulate on the 6th regarding the definite date of withdrawal of the Japanese troops from District D, but as of today (the 11th), two days have passed the agreed deadline of three days, and he has not yet received a reply from the Japanese side. The Japanese side's repeated delays and intentional breach of the agreement clearly violate the spirit of the agreement. Therefore, he notified Ke Nanninghan, chairman of the Joint Committee, by telephone at 11:00 AM today (i.e., yesterday), requesting that he urge the Japanese side to withdraw as soon as possible and notify the Chinese side of the definite date of withdrawal.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Money Trade Association Hosted Newspaper Reporters Last Night <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan,</p>
<p>Repeated emphasis on the need for seriousness</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association hosted newspaper reporters at 7:00 PM yesterday at the association's office on Ningbo Road to discuss the issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan. More than 40 reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Qin Runqing, chairman of the association, presided over the meeting, and Yu Zuoting, Fu Songnian, and Hu Xisheng, all standing committee members, successively gave reports. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Qin Runqing reported. The chairman of the association, Qin Runqing, reported first, saying, "Today, our association invited reporters from various newspapers to gather together. We are very honored that you have taken the time to come despite the sweltering heat. This time, the Ministry of Finance has made a decision to abolish taels and change to yuan. Our association agrees with the principle. However, after the change to yuan, the most important issue is to unify the currency system, so as not to cause hundreds of problems because of one benefit. Therefore, we telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to adopt our opinions a few days ago. However, there are many people outside who do not understand, thinking that the money trade is opposed to abolishing taels and changing to yuan. In fact, the money trade has repeatedly explained before that what we require is to rectify the currency system. The situation of the money trade is slightly different from other financial circles. It has a history of hundreds of years and has always focused on providing credit loans as its main business. If shops need to buy goods, etc., villagers must buy and sell in cash, so credit loans are necessary for trade. As for the advantages and disadvantages of the future currency system, Minister Song has said that after the establishment of the Central Mint in the future, a fair valuation must be researched for the fineness of the new currency. If this can be done, hard currency can be unified. However, the most dangerous thing is still paper money. If the fund reserves are insufficient, once a panic occurs due to political relations, it will inevitably cause unimaginable harm to society. Therefore, several meetings have been held for the overall consideration of society, and we must first seek to unify the currency system. The gentlemen of the press present here are all opinion leaders in society, and we hope that they will uphold justice."</p>
<p>Yu Zuoting reported. Yu Zuoting reported, saying, "Unifying the currency system was initiated in the late Qing Dynasty, and it has not been implemented for decades. It is heartbreaking to say. Although it is due to frequent internal turmoil, most of it is due to the lack of unified issuance. Private banks all have the right to issue currency, and the government does not ask whether the issuance reserves of each bank comply with the law. During the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, money shops in the interior operated as usual, but the issuance could not be redeemed. We have doubts. The true meaning of abolishing taels and changing to yuan is not to borrow its name to promote its reality. We must know that the issuance of currency in China, such as the suspension of redemption by the Sino-French Bank in Tianjin, Hankou, harmed the commercial market. In recent years, the Dongpiao, Jiangqian, and Jitie in the three northeastern provinces have plummeted in market value, and the bank notes of Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Zhili provinces are almost worthless. Prices have soared, and farmers and merchants have gone bankrupt. Shanghai's successive incidents have been able to weather the storm because of the silver cash market. If taels are abolished and yuan are changed, and the hard currency is insufficient, soft currency will inevitably replace it. Once the market changes, I am afraid that it will repeat the mistakes of Tianjin and Hankou, or even follow in the footsteps of Russia and Germany. Moreover, since the January 28th Incident, the Shanghai market has been chaotic, and the financial situation has not recovered. The state of depression has affected the whole country, forming a social and national poverty. If we suddenly change course, it will cause public unrest and panic in the market. If we implement the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, we should ask the government to first unify the currency power and the right to issue currency, and then follow the example of the United States and the United Kingdom to fully prepare for the policy of gradually unifying the currency system, so as not to shake the market."</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Franco-Chinese Water and Electricity Labor Strike Yesterday <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>French Consul Visits Mayor Wu</p>
<p>Arrested Workers Immediately Released</p>
<p>After the strike by the employees of the Mechanical Department of the Franco-Chinese Water and Electricity Company, consultations between the municipal government and the French consul yielded no results. The attitudes of both labor and management are extremely rigid, and the strike is bound to be prolonged. The union's employee department held an emergency meeting yesterday and issued a declaration. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Reduction in the number of vehicles due to damage. Yesterday was the fifth day of the strike. Due to the impact of the strike by the Mechanical Department, tramcars and buses of the Franco-Chinese Water and Electricity Company were damaged and no one was repairing them. Many damaged tramcars and buses were parked in the factory on Luban Road. For example, Route 10 from Lujiawan to the 16th Pier, which originally had eight vehicles, has now been reduced to four vehicles. Route 6, which originally had six vehicles, has now been reduced to two vehicles. As for Route 1 from the 16th Pier to the Zhaojiabang Road, Route 2 from the 16th Pier to Xujiahui, Route 3 from Xiaodongmen to Ximen, Route 4 from Tilanqiao to Zhaojiabang Road, Route 7 from the 16th Pier to Zhaojiabang Road, Route 18 from Xieqiao to Yuezhou Road, etc., the number of vehicles running has been reduced. The number of Route 21 buses has also been slightly reduced.</p>
<p>The course of consultations by the municipal government. After the Franco-Chinese Water and Electricity labor strike was reported to the municipal government by the Social Affairs Bureau, the municipal government immediately sent Secretary Geng Jiaji to meet with French Consul General Meyrier to discuss mediation methods. When Geng Jiaji met with Consul Meyrier, he briefly stated the municipal government's purpose, saying, "The Franco-Chinese Water and Electricity labor strike, the company is a Franco-Chinese company, and the location is in the French Concession. The municipal government originally had no need to interfere. However, the workers are all Chinese, and the number of people is large. In order to achieve a balanced solution and local security as soon as possible, we specifically seek your consul's opinion on whether your consul and the municipal government can jointly mediate to facilitate an early resumption of work and avoid expansion." The French consul replied that this was a disciplinary issue for the company. If dismissing a worker caused so much difficulty, there was really no way to resolve it, and the company's attitude was also very firm. Therefore, there was no substantial result. In addition, French Consul Meyrier visited Mayor Wu at 5:00 PM yesterday to have some contact.</p>
<p>Arrested workers immediately released. The Propaganda Section of the Second Water and Electricity Union Strike Committee yesterday ordered all its members to carry a large number of slogans and distribute them for posting in the Nanshi area, such as "(Down with the scab and traitor Lu Guanhong!)", "(Oppose the company's unjustified dismissal of workers!)", "(Down with imperialism!)", "(Support the Strike Committee!)", etc. As a result, the trams of the Franco-Chinese Routes 3, 5, and 6 and the walls were full of slogans. At 1:00 PM, worker Xue Wanshan was arrested by the police officers of the First Police Station of the Public Security Bureau near Xiaodongmen for posting slogans. After receiving the report, the union immediately sent Zhang Fubao to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to request his release. Xu Yefu, chief of the Third Section of the Bureau, sent Zhu Guilin to the Public Security Bureau together with Zhou Lianze of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Wang Zhijing, chief of the Second Section, notified the First Police Station to release him at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>The union held a talk meeting yesterday. The Second Water and Electricity Union held a talk meeting at Dadali, Luban Road, at 1:00 PM yesterday. More than 800 members attended, and the surrounding area was maintained by the picket team. Shen Jing, of the Strike Committee, first reported on the negotiations between the municipal government's secretary Geng Jiaji and the French consul, and advised the members to strictly abide by order and wait patiently for the mediation of the party and government organs. As long as all members are united, they will surely achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Emergency meeting of employees. Due to the fact that the French Electricity Company's Chinese employees withdrew from the union as reported in various newspapers, the Employee Department of the Second Water and Electricity Union convened an emergency meeting of the Employee Department at the union in the morning. More than 60 people attended, and all said that this kind of fellowship association must be a small number of bad elements who listened lightly to blind words and were deliberately tempted by the capitalists to undermine the labor movement. In addition to absolutely denying the union's organization, they also issued a declaration.</p>
<p>The union solemnly declares. The Second Water and Electricity Union Mechanical Department members solemnly declare and refute the illegal organization of the fellowship association.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Has a General Strike Rumor <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Will Summon Both Parties for Questioning Today</p>
<p>The Union Petitioned the Party and Government Organs Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the labor unrest in the traditional Chinese medicine industry in this city, the union sent representatives to petition the party and government organs yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to summon both labor and management for questioning today. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The union petitioned yesterday. The Pharmaceutical Vocational Union sent representatives Fang Qinghe and others to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau at 11:00 AM yesterday to petition for the prompt mediation of the labor dispute at Feng Cunrentang. Wang Manyun, director of the Civil Training Section, and Wang Xianqing, director of the Mediation Department, received them and accepted the union's proposed conditions. The original petition is recorded as follows: "Petition for the matter of the association. The association has received a joint report from all members of Feng Cunrentang, stating that the manager has violated the conditions and imposed various unreasonable oppressions. Repeated reasonable requests have been rejected with insults and curses, resulting in unbearable circumstances. They had no choice but to implement a strike starting on the 1st of this month and have submitted a request to the party and government organs for mediation. The capitalist is inherently cunning, resulting in no results. (Omitted) All members have come to petition and humbly request to be received so that they may state everything and request that personnel be dispatched to lead them and transfer to higher levels to petition, requesting prompt and impartial mediation to avoid further expansion of the dispute." For this reason, a document has been prepared, and two comrades, Fang Qinghe and others, have been sent as representatives to accompany all the employees of Feng Cunrentang to your ministry for petition, handing in the document in person, humbly requesting to be received for public convenience.</p>
<p>Emergency meeting of the association. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Trade Association has recently received secret reports from its members that the Pharmaceutical Vocational Union has dispatched cadres to various district branches and store groups to guide and prepare for a city-wide general strike, including the method and it is scheduled to be convened on the 17th of this month, the union will hold general assembly of all members. During the previous large-scale strikes in the pharmaceutical industry, the union would first set a date to convene a general meeting of members, and after the meeting, the employees would not return to the store to implement a general strike. Therefore, the union's convening of a general meeting of members on the 17th is no different from a general mobilization for a general strike. However, during this summer epidemic prevention period, if the union blatantly disregards social public health and insists on implementing a general strike, it will endanger society. The association is making appropriate prevention measures and held an emergency meeting of the executive committee at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss preventing the union from launching a general strike. At the same time, it appointed two responsible representatives of the association to attend the mediation meeting of the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>The party and government will question today. In order to prevent the expansion of the pharmaceutical labor unrest, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau will convene the Pharmaceutical Union and the National Medicine Trade Association for questioning at 1:00 PM this afternoon, together with the Municipal Party Headquarters, in order to conduct mediation. The notification is recorded below: "Notification for the matter of the pharmaceutical labor dispute. It is hereby decided to convene a questioning session at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of July 12. It is hereby ordered that the association send two responsible representatives to attend on time to listen to the questioning. This is hereby notified. July 10, 21st year of the Republic of China, Wu Xingya, Director."</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Shanghai Municipal Council's Special Board Meeting Approves the Principle of Returning Extraterritorial Roads <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Passed with a vote of seven to six to accept</p>
<p>Progress was made in the continued consultations between the two parties last night</p>
<p>After the draft agreement on resolving the extraterritorial roads of the Shanghai International Settlement was submitted by Stirling Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, for discussion at a special board meeting last Wednesday, the principle of accepting it was passed at that time. The remaining issues were only a few minor revisions to one of the items and wording. Last night, the representatives of both parties consulted once again, and some progress was made. The news obtained yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>The principle of returning was approved. According to reliable sources, at the special board meeting convened by the Shanghai Municipal Council last Wednesday to discuss the draft agreement on extraterritorial roads, all directors expressed considerable opinions. After a vote, it was formally approved with seven votes to six to accept the principle of returning the extraterritorial roads to China. There are fourteen directors on the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Director-General has no voting rights during peacetime, but if one of the directors gives up their vote due to an opinion or other reason, and the number of affirmative and negative votes cast by the remaining directors is the same, then the Director-General can participate in one vote. Therefore, at the special board meeting last Wednesday, excluding the vote of Director-General Bell, the remaining thirteen votes were passed with seven votes to six.</p>
<p>The content has been confirmed. The content of the three draft agreements previously published by the New Sound Society are: (1) All extraterritorial roads of the Shanghai International Settlement will be completely returned to the administration of the Chinese government. (2) After the extraterritorial roads are returned to the administration of the Chinese government, all police powers and other matters relating to the roads will also be returned to the administration of the Chinese government. However, in view of the large number of foreigners residing near the extraterritorial roads, both parties agree to establish a special police agency, with the Chinese government appointing a Chinese person as police chief and simultaneously appointing a foreigner approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council as deputy police chief. Underneath them, there will be a number of Chinese and foreign police officers, all of whom will be appointed by the Chinese government to serve in their respective positions. (3) The various taxes collected within the extraterritorial roads will be used to cover all expenses of the special police agency and the construction of roads. The administration of these taxes will be jointly responsible by the municipal government and the Shanghai Municipal Council. If there is a shortage of funds, the municipal government and the Shanghai Municipal Council will be jointly responsible for supplementing it equally. After many inquiries, the above three items have been completely confirmed and are generally accurate. However, the matter of the police chief and deputy police chief jointly handling disputes between Chinese and foreigners is confirmed to be inaccurate because it conflicts with the Shanghai International Settlement Special District Court Agreement. The points still need to be discussed. The Chinese side has received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and instructed Yu Hongjun to propose three revisions. It is now heard that there are not many problems. Only the Shanghai Municipal Council still requires some revisions to the wording and a certain item. It is said that this item is extremely important.</p>
<p>The two parties met last night. Director Fessenden of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been ill for several days, preventing a meeting. Mr. Fessenden had originally agreed with Yu Hongjun to go to the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM this morning, but he could not leave the house due to pain. The meeting was changed to 3:30 PM at Mr. Fessenden's private residence, but at 3:30 PM, Mr. Fessenden was still unable to receive guests. It was agreed that Mr. , Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, would represent Mr. Fessenden and meet with Mr. Yu at 5:00 PM. It is heard that the result has made some progress.</p>

<p>To Organize the Northeast National Salvation Army Liaison Office. Zhu Jiqing, member of the Central Committee, returned to Beijing from outside the customs last month to report on the progress of his work. He then came to Shanghai to contact people from all walks of life, intending to organize a Northeast National Salvation Army Liaison Office to serve as a rear support for the resistance against Japan. He hosted people from all walks of life at the Atlantic Hotel yesterday afternoon, with more than 100 people attending. Committee Member Zhu first reported on the progress of his work outside the customs, expressing deep gratitude for the enthusiastic assistance from all walks of life. Zheng Zhengqiu, Wu Shan, Wang Lixi, and Cai Fenchong, representatives of overseas Chinese, then gave speeches. It was decided that Committee Member Zhu would invite prominent figures from all walks of life to form groups to be responsible for the work of the Economic, Transportation, and Propaganda Committees, and to first form a Northeast National Salvation Army Shanghai Liaison Office to support the anti-Japanese volunteer army in the Northeast and plan all matters in the rear. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Patriotism Promotion Week Closed Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Provisional Shanghai Airplane Fundraising Committee (Shanghai Call Number), formed by Shanghai various groups' national salvation associations on Xiaoximen Zhonghua Road in this city, felt deeply that foreign insults were increasing daily, while the public spirit in Shanghai was declining as well. Thus, a grand promotion week was held to arouse public attention. Time flies like an arrow, and yesterday was the last day of the association's promotion week. A closing ceremony was specially held at the Xiaoximen Juvenile Propaganda Corps, attended by more than 600 representatives from various groups and guests. Although the scorching sun was blazing and sweat poured down, no one cared. This shows that the hearts of the people are not dead, and the country can still be saved. At 2:00 p.m., the meeting was called to order. Zhang Tianbai was the chairman, Jiang Daiqing was the recorder, Chen Yaofu was the director of general affairs, Chen Peide was the director of entertainment, Xu Gongmei was the front desk director, Yu Zhenhui was the backstage director, Song An was the executive director, and Wu Ganxin was the master of ceremonies. Chairman Zhang Tianbai delivered the opening remarks, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, it is very hot today, but you have come here despite the heat, which shows that you all have patriotic blood and national salvation enthusiasm. However, while you are all more enthusiastic and patriotic than others, there are also many people who while away the days and put national disasters behind them. During the (January 28th) incident, the people here indeed felt pain and resentment towards the enemy, but as time passed, they forgot everything. Even some unscrupulous merchants are selling enemy goods again. How did these unscrupulous merchants grow their hearts? Our association is very worried about this situation, so we held this promotion week, hoping to awaken the public and make them work hard together for a long time. Now, the atmosphere in Tianjin, Beiping and other places is getting tighter every day. If another incident occurs, then the people of our Southeast and even the whole country will be prepared to taste the pain that the 30 million compatriots in the three northeastern provinces have already tasted. Therefore, before this pain is tasted, we should have a thorough awakening and unite to save ourselves." Then, Shen Zurong and others gave speeches (the length of the speeches is omitted). Their words were alarming and won a lot of applause. Finally, Zhang Tianbai proposed that the association initiate a fundraising campaign among the people of this city to purchase airplanes, which would be named "Shanghai." The Shanghai Airplane Fundraising Committee was then appointed.</p>

<p>Can be realized in July next year</p>
<p>The matter of Sino-British telegraph communication has been widely publicized for a long time. At present, the International Telecommunication Bureau is working hard to carry it out, and on the 20th of last month, it signed a communication contract with the Ministry of Communications and the British Imperial Communications Company. On the 28th of last month, it spent 780,000 yuan to purchase two short-wave generators from the British Marconi Company. The generators are the latest type of beam transmitters, whose English name is "Beam." The electricity emitted from Shanghai is focused into a line and directed straight to London, without scattering to other places. The beam transmitters can be shipped from London to Shanghai by the end of this year, and will be installed by the end of June next year. Formal communication can begin in July.</p>

<h3 id="e146">The Rent Reduction Association Petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters Yesterday <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Because there were no results, they will go again today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Movement Committee believes that the rent reduction measures announced by the municipal government are unfair. Therefore, it was decided at a meeting the day before yesterday to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters for correction. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the association specially sent representatives Zhang Yichan, Yu Hualong, and Sun Mingqi to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. Huang Xuchu, a member of the Supervisory Committee, received them. After the representatives stated their intentions, Huang replied that he was not in a position to respond and would submit the matter to the Executive Committee for handling. Since the representatives did not get the gist of the matter, they decided to continue petitioning this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Pudong Rent Reduction Association's Petition <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Pudong Rent Reduction Association believes that the standard rent reduction measures promulgated by the municipal government do not mention the Pudong area, which is unfair. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, they specially sent Sun Xiaozhu, Zheng Xiecheng, Ye Huixun, Zhang Yuping, Gu Shuren, Qian Dongye, Song Peiji, Zhang Jisan, Liu Hairu, and other nine people to the municipal government and the Municipal Party Headquarters with a petition. When they arrived at the municipal government, the Secretary-General was out, so Wang Shaozhai, the Director of Audit, received them instead. The representatives handed over the petition and stated their intentions. Wang explained everything and said that rent disputes involve legal issues. The municipal government's announcement is a standard measure, not mandatory enforcement. He will convey the intentions of the gentlemen to the mayor. The representatives left and went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, where Wang Manyun, the Director of Civil Training, received them and promised to add reasons to the petition and forward it to the municipal government to show fairness. The representatives were satisfied and returned to Pudong. They had originally planned to petition the five district party headquarters in the area that day, but because the petition was not written in time, they will change it to petition today.</p>

<p>Dong Xiujia, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, went to Nanqiao Town, Fengxian County, on the 10th of this month to inspect the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway project. He was accompanied by Qian Yuge, the director of the road project office, Chen Wangong, the engineer, Shen Qingchen, the magistrate of Fengxian County, and Zhou Zancai, the director of the county's construction bureau, to inspect the road along the way. Dong gave a lot of guidance on the road project. It is understood that both Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces started construction on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway last month, and the work is very busy. The Jiangsu section is longer, and the transportation of materials is quite far, so construction is particularly difficult. However, Dong believes that the road is very important for transportation between the two provinces and should be completed as soon as possible. It is said that he has instructed the project office to overcome difficulties and speed up the work to complete it by September 1st of this year.</p>

<p>The Chaozhou Returned to Shanghai Fellow Association telegraphed Chen, Commander-in-Chief of the First Group Army in Guangzhou, Lin, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Qu, Director of the Department of Finance, yesterday, saying: "It is heard that various counties in Chaozhou are currently levying national defense fortress public bonds and airplane purchase fees. Chaoyang, Puning, and Huilai counties are also levying bandit suppression land taxes. We believe that Guangdong is in the midst of a civil war, and there is no time to manage national defense. The counties in Chaozhou have suffered from military disasters and banditry in recent years, and their livelihoods depend on the Nanyang Islands. Overseas Chinese are currently being oppressed by the local governments of various islands and their economies are in dire straits. It is a time of poverty and exhaustion. How can the authorities bear to do this? Don't they know that many bandits are driven by life? If this method is adopted, we are afraid that the more bandits are suppressed, the more there will be. The news from the hometown is urgent and desperate. We implore you to approve the cancellation of the national defense fortress public bonds and airplane purchase fees in Chaozhou, as well as the land taxes in the three counties, and order the counties to stop collecting them immediately to relieve the people from their suffering and revive their lives, leading to the south of the sky.

<h3 id="e154">The Precursor of Reorganizing Chinese Medicine <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, Chinese medicine has been stagnant and has made little progress. Patriotic people are concerned about the dumping of foreign medicines and regard it as a concern for the economic future of our country. Therefore, recently, people in the common medicine industry have risen up to become stronger, which is often heard. However, there is no whole method, so there are few successes. It is now heard that Mr. Huang Qizong of Guangdong is enthusiastic about medicine and spares no effort. This spring, he came to Shanghai with the 19th Route Army. In addition to his rear work, he also wrote a draft on the reorganization of Chinese medical books and sent it out. He intended to take the opportunity to invite celebrities from the medical and pharmaceutical circles in Shanghai to discuss the matter together. However, the situation was serious and the people were uneasy, so he could not start. Recently, the situation has been peaceful. Mr. Huang has repeatedly sent letters to famous doctors Wu Keqian and Jiang Wenfang in Guangdong to discuss the matter. The first step is to organize a sound research association and publish valuable publications to create a precedent for reorganization. In the future, the reorganization opinions will be widely disseminated throughout the country to obtain a public decision. The funds will be donated by overseas Chinese and patriotic people at home and abroad.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Falsifying Rent Tickets Was Prosecuted and Punished <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Residents in the Public Concession who try to evade municipal donations have recently increased significantly. The Bureau of Works can only take legal action. Wu Changfu of 25-26 Shanxi Road was prosecuted by the Bureau of Works' lawyer, Mr. Ru Baoyi, on behalf of the police, in the Special District Court for falsifying rent tickets and not paying the full amount of the donation. In May of this year, the Donation Office found that the rent at that location, including water, was actually 137.5 yuan per month, so it calculated the donation amount based on 131 yuan. However, the defendant claimed that the monthly rent was 89 yuan and produced a rent ticket as proof. After investigation, it was found that the ticket was forged. Therefore, the Bureau of Works prosecuted him. After interrogation by the judge, the Donation Office stated the situation of going to collect donations on May 17th as stated by Mr. Chadar. According to the defendant, he opened a shop in the house at 25-26 Shanxi Road. The owner of the house is an insurance company, but he rented it from a Cantonese named Huang at the end of March, but he does not know where he lives. Since March, the rent has been collected three times, but there are no receipts. Then he changed his statement, saying that he had only received it once in mid-April and forgot to record it in the account. He only asked his wife to do it for him. After paying the rent once, he heard that the house had changed hands. When the donation collector came on May 17th, the receipt taken out by his wife was actually wrong. According to the rent collector of Qingyun Company, the company bought the house from Sassoon Yanghang in January of this year. The defendant also rented it in January. Before that, the rent was collected from a Cantonese. Since February, March, April, and May, the rent has been collected from the defendant, and the rent has not increased. It has always been 137.5 yuan. After the judge reviewed the case, he believed that the defendant should not have tried to forge documents and obtain improper benefits. He was fined 200 yuan or imprisoned for 100 days to show an example.</p>

<p>Fei Huitang from Xuzhou, 38 years old, had been running a tobacco and paper shop in Guanyintang, Tanjia, Hutai Road, Zhabei. When the Shanghai war broke out, Fei refused to flee and remained in the area. When our army retreated to the second line of defense, the area fell to the enemy. As a result, traitors took the opportunity to rise up and often formed gangs to rob and plunder. How could the Fei family be spared? On March 29th, many people suddenly came to Fei's shop with guns to search and loot. Everything, big and small, was tied up and taken away. Fei's life was tied to this, and he died of resentment. His family did not dare to speak out and hastily collected the body. Now that the situation has calmed down, Fei's brother, Fei Futang, believes that his brother died tragically and filed a complaint with the local court requesting redress. The court ordered that the coffin be brought to the court for inspection. Yesterday, the coffin was brought to the forensic inspection office. The village prosecutor and inspectors Shen and Xuan came to the office to inspect the body. It was found that the body had already turned to ashes, leaving only bones.

<p>The Thieves Confessed Readily to Robbery</p>
<p>Woman Named Meiyu Granted Bail</p>
<p>The home of Madam Zhou Shi, located at No. 4, Lane 132, Route d'Edoard, was burglarized on the 13th of last month by five or six bandits who brandished handguns, silencing any outcry, and making off with valuables worth over 1,500 yuan. Afterward, Madam Zhou reported the incident to the Zhabei Police Station, requesting an investigation. Detectives Zhao Fuhai and Cui Shun of the station learned that the bandits were planning another robbery on the night of the 9th at 10:30 PM, and would pass through the intersection of Route d'Edoard and Yunnan Road. They coordinated with Inspectors Tang Jian and Li Shizhong, and Detective Ye Yushan, and proceeded to the location to lie in wait. When Liang Guisheng, Wu Xiaoming, Liu Qianbao, and Chen Rongsheng arrived, the detectives apprehended them together at the station. Upon interrogation, it was learned that other accomplices were hiding in various locations. The detectives then went to No. 44, Yong'an Li, Yunnan Road, Room 38 of the Great Shanghai Hotel, and No. 12, Route Amiral Courbet, where they successively apprehended Shi Baosheng, Ren Zixin, Lin Tiansheng, Dong Shengjing, Shen Pengfei, Zhu Shuangxi (also known as Wang Kunshan), as well as a woman named Xiao Meiyu and a woman named Ding Zhangshi.

Yesterday morning, the police station summoned the victim, Madam Zhou Shi, and transferred the male and female bandits to the First Special District Court, where Judge Ge interrogated them. According to the police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, the other individuals involved had not been investigated thoroughly for other robbery cases, so the charges were only for illegal possession of military firearms and artillery. He requested an extension of the investigation after the hearing to facilitate further investigation. However, Xiao Meiyu had been cooperative with the police in the investigation, and he requested that she be granted bail pending trial. Madam Zhou Shi then identified Liang Guisheng, Lin Tiansheng, and Dong Shengjing as having been present at her home during the robbery. The three thieves confessed to the robbery upon hearing the victim's testimony. Shen Pengfei was even more forthcoming, readily admitting that he had also participated in the robbery at Madam Zhou Shi's home, and offered that two of the five handguns seized were his. Dong also confessed that the other three handguns belonged to him. The judge then granted Xiao Meiyu bail, ordering her to be available for questioning upon notice, and remanded the rest to custody, postponing the hearing for fourteen days.</p>

Xue Man, who worked as a stoker at the water boiler shop in Fuxing Li, Xie Xu Road, said that police officers had arrested him at the water boiler shop the previous night. He didn't recognize any of the robbers, but if they had come for tea, he wouldn't remember them because many people came for tea. After questioning the suspects, District Chief Zhang brought the victims to the district headquarters to confirm the robberies and provide a list of stolen items. He then prepared a document and sent it, along with the robbers, to the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for further investigation.</p>

As a result, Warden Xu Chongwen, Medical Officer Yu Minggao, and Prison Worker Zhou Zongxiang have been charged with abandonment and assault in the Second District Court. Judge Wang Gangxu of the Criminal Division held a hearing and adjourned the case for a later date. Meanwhile, Judge Ying Shi and Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan have jointly sent a letter to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home, instructing them to transport the coffin to Shanghai for re-examination. This matter has already been reported in the newspapers. Here is the latest news:</p>
<p>Coffin Transported to Shanghai The coffin arrived at the Shanghai South Salvation Bureau at 7:00 AM yesterday and was immediately sent to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home. Mr. Qin Shounong, the former director of the funeral home, personally sealed the coffin with tape at the top, bottom, head, and feet. At 11:45 AM, the coffin was transported to the Bureau of Works autopsy room on Dallas Road and placed in a cold storage room to await the scheduled re-examination.</p>
<p>Individuals Present in Court Yesterday marked the second hearing in the case. The Police Department notified the plaintiffs and witnesses to be present for questioning. At 9:00 AM, the plaintiff, the deceased's brother, Simon Grietzki, and his lawyer, Plaimeh Eichenlin, arrived at the court to await the hearing. Witnesses Seriek Mutusnikoff (also translated as Kwatnitz-Gukoff), Dzipuk Dalaeff, and Vladimir Guruluk Tchirkina arrived shortly after. On the defendant's side, Medical Officer Yu Minggao and Prison Guard Zhou Zongxiang arrived. At 10:00 AM, Judge Wang, accompanied by Secretary Zhu, took their seats in Criminal Court No. 1. Judge Ying Shi also attended the hearing, sitting behind Judge Wang to listen. The Russian Emigrant's Association in China was represented by lawyer Wei, who also attended to listen.</p>
<p>Initial Questioning of the Plaintiff First, lawyer Feiduzhen from the Police Department stated that the Police Department had brought the plaintiff and all witnesses. The court ordered the plaintiff, the deceased's brother, to be brought to the stand for questioning (all words were translated by translator Shen Jinshun). He stated that his name was Simon Grietzki, age 35, a Russian national, residing at No. 108, Huanlong Road. The deceased, Georgi Latych-Eff, was his younger brother, age 33. Asked how he knew Georgi Latych-Eff was his brother, he replied that he had seen a photograph and had been told by others. Asked if he knew his brother had been arrested, he replied that he did not. Asked if he knew about his brother's death, he replied that he learned of it from someone who had been detained with his brother. Asked if he had seen the body after death, he replied that he had reported it to the police station but had not seen the body. The court then showed him a photograph and asked if the person was his brother, to which he replied yes. Asked how he knew his brother had been beaten to death as he reported at the police station, he replied that Seriek Mutusnikoff, who had been detained with him, had reported to him that his brother had been beaten to death by a prison guard, and that there were serious injuries to his head, face, nose, and chest. One account said that he died of illness but was not treated when he was sick. Asked if he wanted to request a re-examination of the body, he replied yes, he wanted to request a re-examination. Asked how long it had been since he last saw his brother, he replied that he had last seen him seven days before his arrest, at the evening newspaper office, where he worked as a proofreader. He also stated that his brother had no wife or children. Asked if he was willing to proceed even though the body had already decomposed and external injuries would be difficult to detect, he replied that he was.</p>
<p>First Witness At this point, the judge ordered the first witness to be questioned. Lawyer Plaimeh, representing the plaintiff, stated that he had a few important words to say before the witnesses were questioned and requested that the court question the two defendants (his intention was likely to prevent the defendants from hearing the witnesses' testimonies and changing their own). The judge asked if he was afraid that the defendants would hear the witnesses' words and then ordered defendants Yu and Zhou to leave the courtroom. The witness, Seriek Mutusnikoff, then stated that he was age 50, a Russian national, currently residing with friends at no fixed address, and made a living doing small business. The judge told the witness that he had to tell the truth and that, according to Chinese law, he had to swear an oath first, and that he could be charged with perjury if he lied.

<p>Third Witness The judge asked the witness, Vladimir Guruluk Tchirkina, if he was arrested with the deceased Georgi Latych-Eff. The witness replied that the matter was the same.

The plaintiff had invited him to report to the police station together the next day, but he did not come.</p>
<p>Defendant Testimony The judge ordered the two defendants, Yu and Zhou, to be brought in. Zhou Zongxiang was asked if the three Russians testifying were in Cell No. 4 at the time. Zhou examined the faces of the three men and replied that the first two were, but he did not remember the third. Zhou was asked if they had asked him to call a doctor, and he replied that they had not. He stated that it was after 5 o'clock, which was dinnertime, and the deceased was lying on the ground, not eating. He reported this to the warden and asked the medical officer to come and treat him. The judge then asked the three Russian witnesses if they recognized the defendant, medical officer Yu Minggao. They all said they had never seen him before. Yu was asked if he had treated the deceased, and he replied that he had treated him. He stated that it was dinnertime and he was afraid they would be eating and not paying attention, but he went to see the patient. He did not speak to them and there was no need to speak to them. They did not recognize him, and he did not recognize them. He rarely went into the prison cells. The judge then asked the three Russians if they were eating and did not notice the medical officer coming to examine the patient. The three men all replied that they were together and had not seen the doctor come. He then asked Zhou if he had been eating in the cell when the meal was served. He replied that they were eating in the cell. The plaintiff's lawyer, Plameh, asked the court to ask medical officer Yu Minggao what clothes the deceased was wearing when he examined him. Yu replied that he was wearing ordinary clothes. The judge then asked the three Russians what color clothes the deceased was wearing. They all replied that he was wearing black wool. The Police Department's lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated that he had a question for medical officer Yu: Did he go to treat patients in the detention center based on a report from the prison guard, or did he need permission from the warden to enter the detention center to treat patients? Yu replied that he would naturally need to obey the warden's orders and have permission to enter the detention center to treat patients. Otherwise, he could not directly enter the prison cell. The judge then asked the plaintiff, the deceased's brother, if he insisted on requesting a re-examination of the body. The plaintiff replied that he wanted a clear re-examination to determine the cause of death.</p>
<p>Exhumation Tomorrow At this point, it was noon. The court clerk stood up and read aloud the transcripts of each person's testimony. The court then decided to exhume and re-examine or dissect the body of Georgi Latych-Eff at 10:00 AM on the 13th to conduct further inquiries. The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Shipping Dispute Caused by Yu'an's Chartered Boat Attracts Attention from Shipping Industry <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Arbitration Cannot Cancel Contract</p>
<p>Both Parties Involved in Legal Remedies</p>
<p>The Yu'an Shipping Company in this city chartered the Taiping ship from Zhongwei to load goods in North China. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Yu'an wanted to recover the charter fee. Zhongwei refused the request because it was not in accordance with the facts and principles. Yu'an then submitted to arbitration. However, Yu'an overturned the arbitration award and filed a lawsuit, which has caused resentment in the Shanghai shipping industry. They are afraid that opening this unreasonable dispute will have a huge impact on the shipping industry and will lead to various disputes. Now Zhongwei has also filed a counterclaim, which is detailed below.</p>
<p>Chartering Before the War The Yu'an Shipping Company chartered the Taiping ship from Zhongwei Company because a large number of coal was loaded from Tianjin to various parts of Guangdong. The monthly rent should have been 15,000 yuan. Due to the friendship between Chen Shuntong and Zhao Yuntai, the rent was reduced to 13,500 yuan. The Taiping ship was chartered to Tianjin, and the Shanghai war had not yet broken out. When it arrived in North China to transport goods, the war in Shanghai had already broken out. However, at this time, coastal merchant ships were still operating normally, and those in the North and Guangdong were even less affected. However, Zhao Yuntai suddenly proposed to terminate the contract with Zhongwei.</p>
<p>Dispute over Suspension of Rent The Yu'an Company used the excuse of the Sino-Japanese war to terminate the charter and asked Zhongwei to refund the fee. Zhongwei Company believes that Yu'an has misinterpreted the provisions and does not conform to the facts and principles of the Shanghai war. How can they use this to distort the facts? Moreover, the Taiping ship chartered to travel from the North to Guangzhou is not within the Shanghai war zone. The ship has not been affected in practice, so it cannot overturn the contract and create this bad precedent.</p>
<p>Shipping Association Arbitration Zhao Yuntai, the owner of Yu'an, submitted the dispute to the Shanghai Shipping Association for arbitration. The Shipping Association designated Chen Ganqing, the owner of Zhao Xing Shipping Company, and Wang Bofen, the manager of Zheng Ji Shipping Company, as arbitrators. After several meetings, the arbitration plan was as follows: (1) Although the war broke out in Shanghai, war had not been formally declared, and commercial ships were not hindered. Moreover, the stevedores at the wharves in this city had not stopped unloading goods. The charter contract should not be cancelled. (2) The two companies are both members and should prioritize sentiment. The second month's rent that has already been paid should not be refunded, and the third month's rent will no longer be paid, thus ending the contract. The Tianjin-Guangdong line is even safer, and there is no reason to cancel the contract and demand a refund.</p>
<p>Filing a Lawsuit Zhao expressed dissatisfaction with the arbitration notice and proposed using the Englishman Maller as an arbitrator again. The result was the same as above, ordering the third month's rent to be stopped. Zhao was also dissatisfied and asked a lawyer to use the excuse of the war to overwhelm Zhongwei, so as to achieve the purpose of terminating the contract and returning the charter fee, but this has caused dissatisfaction in the Shanghai shipping industry.</p>
<p>Zhongwei Counterclaims After this incident, most of the shipping companies in this city advocated ending the case in accordance with the arbitration. However, after Zhao Yuntai filed a lawsuit, it was tantamount to considering the arbitrators' claims to be illegal, which aroused resentment in the shipping industry. The reason is that the Taiping ship did not travel in the war zone, but transported goods on a safe route, without suffering any loss. Moreover, the contract clauses contain legal principles. The Japanese did not declare war and these points cannot distort the clauses. If other ships follow this precedent and refuse to recognize the charter fee, wouldn't it affect the whole situation with one move and create a bad precedent? Today, Zhongwei Company has submitted various evidence to its hired lawyer to prepare to file a counterclaim.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Hardoon Estate Case Ruled in Favor of Hardoon's Wife <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>British Court Made Ruling the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Following repeated court hearings held by the British Court of Probate in the past month regarding the Hardoon estate case, the presiding judge, Glan, delivered a verdict yesterday morning (the 10th), upholding Hardoon's will. The plaintiff lost the case, and all four million pounds of the estate remain under the control of Hardoon's wife.</p>
<p>Arguments in the Estate Dispute After the Jewish tycoon Hardoon passed away on February 1st of last year, his will stipulated that all his assets be given to his wife, Mrs. Luo Jialing. On July 16th, the British Court of Probate examined and approved the will. However, two months later, a person named Ezra Hardoon, claiming to be a cousin of the deceased Hardoon, filed a petition with the British Court of Probate to halt the legal proceedings. At the same time, he submitted a sworn affidavit stating that the deceased was mentally incapacitated when the will was signed and was subject to undue influence, rendering the will invalid. On November 9th, Ezra Hardoon appeared in court again and supplemented his reasons, stating that the estate should be handled in accordance with Iraqi law. On December 1st, he submitted a further complaint, claiming that the deceased was a Jew born in Baghdad and was under the protection of British diplomats according to the 1924 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. Therefore, the deceased was not British. Jewish customs do not recognize marriage between Jews and non-Jews. According to Iraqi law, the will can only include one-third of the deceased's property, and foreigners cannot inherit the estate.</p>
<p>Hardoon's Wife's Defense The defendant, Mrs. Hardoon, admitted that the deceased Hardoon was a Jew born in Baghdad but denied that he was only under the protection of British diplomats because of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. She claimed that she had obtained British nationality, was legally married, and had long abandoned her original domicile and obtained a domicile in China. She also denied that the plaintiff and the deceased were cousins.</p>
<p>Another Hardoon Joins the Estate Dispute The case was heard by Sir Glan, the British Consul General, on June 6th. The plaintiff was represented by lawyers Wilkinson and Brownell, while the defendant was represented by lawyers Potter from Hong Kong and Brandt from Shanghai. After the trial began, another Hardoon from Mumbai, Isaac Hardoon, also claiming to be a close relative of the deceased, joined the lawsuit, represented by lawyer Samuel from London and lawyer Haddad from Shanghai. After two weeks of hearings, the trial was concluded.</p>
<p>Key Points of the Verdict Yesterday morning, the British Consul General announced the verdict, ruling in favor of the defendant. The verdict stated that anyone under British protection is in the same position as British citizens in terms of jurisdiction and law. Furthermore, the deceased Hardoon had obtained a domicile in China, and his estate should be handled according to the laws of the country of residence. According to the Sino-British Treaty, the case is under the jurisdiction of the British court, and the laws followed by the British court are naturally British law. The verdict also stated that if the case were appealed, the Iraqi law and Jewish law mentioned in the case were not proven during the trial. Furthermore, the plaintiff did not provide any evidence to prove that Ezra Hardoon and the deceased were cousins. As for Isaac Hardoon's claim that he was a close relative of the deceased, it was only based on what his deceased father, who died 44 years ago, had told him. The verdict also stated that the will was properly signed by the deceased and the witnesses and was indisputable. The claim that the deceased was mentally incapacitated had been abandoned. After the verdict was announced, the defendant's lawyer requested a one-month stay of execution, which was not granted by the court. The two parties' lawyers then jointly requested that the court fees be apportioned according to a specific form.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Snake and Hedgehog Fight <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Spectators Marvel</p>
<p>Thief Seizes Opportunity to Steal</p>
<p>A rogue from Zhenjiang named Wang Zigui recently obtained a small green snake and a hedgehog (commonly known as a "melon-stealing beast") in the countryside. He trained the two creatures to fight, and then drew crowds to watch in open spaces. He colluded with accomplices Da Shunzi and Da Xingzi, who took the opportunity to steal valuables from the spectators. Their success rate was high, and they divided the spoils for their own use. The number of victims was countless. At around 8 a.m. the day before yesterday, they were again performing near the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Wuchang Road, attracting a large crowd. A Jiangxi man named Ding Amao was also watching and marveling at the spectacle when he suddenly discovered that his wallet, containing 27.20 silver dollars, had disappeared. He shouted for the thief to be caught. Detective Bai Mingfu happened to be investigating the area and, after learning the details, arrested Wang and took him to the police station. However, his accomplices had already escaped. Yesterday, he was handed over to the First Special District Court, where Judge Shen Bingrong planned to try him. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the details of the case and requested that the defendant be punished as a warning to others. The judge questioned the defendant and, after clarifying the facts, sentenced the defendant to one year of imprisonment as a warning. The bamboo cage used to store the snake and hedgehog was confiscated.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>A woman from Yangzhou named Huang Zhangshi, aged twenty-four, residing at No. 2 Tao Peng Road, recently formed an illicit relationship with Wang Jinsheng from Qingjiang. They engaged in clandestine affairs more than once. Her husband, Huang Jialin, was completely unaware. One evening at half-past ten, Wang Jinsheng took advantage of her husband being out enjoying the cool air, stealthily entered her bedroom, intending to continue their affair. While they were sitting on the bed whispering sweet nothings, her husband Huang Jialin returned home and witnessed the scene. Filled with anger, he grabbed a kitchen knife and violently struck Wang Jinsheng in the head, causing injury. Wang, being very strong, still attempted to escape through the door, and in turn, seized the knife, slashing Huang Jialin's left wrist. They wrestled to the ground. Patrolman Li Wenzhao discovered them and apprehended Wang Jinsheng, taking him to the police station. The police chief, after questioning them, found that both had been injured and ordered them to be sent to Tongren Hospital. Fortunately, their injuries were minor. After the doctor applied medication and bandages, they were immediately discharged. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Wang Jinsheng to the First Special District Court for investigation. Subsequently, the plaintiff testified about the situation at the time. Huang Zhangshi also confessed that she had known the defendant privately for only two or three months. Last night, he came again, intending to continue their affair, and the conflict arose when her husband returned home. The court reprimanded her for her shamelessness and ordered her to leave. Then, Huang Wangshi, the woman’s mother-in-law, testified that the defendant indeed entered her daughter-in-law’s room and engaged in lewd behavior. This was seen by Jialin, leading to a jealous uproar, and he was instead wounded by the knife. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he had known the plaintiff for a long time and had previously asked him to introduce business. He was borrowed five yuan, and last night he went to collect the debt. He accused me of having an affair with the woman, and he used a kitchen knife to cut my head, so I seized the knife and cut his wrist, which is the truth. Judge Shen Bingrong ordered the court attendants to accompany both the plaintiff and defendant to the forensic doctor for examination. Wang Jinsheng was then sentenced to imprisonment for months as a warning.</p>

<p>Combined with Bigamy Case for Trial</p>
<p>Guo Luman, son of wealthy merchant Guo Yonglan, recently held a wedding ceremony with female painter Xu Zhiqing, leading Guo's legal wife, Guo Han, nee Han Yueling, to accuse Guo of bigamy to the police. The police have filed a public prosecution. Separately, a private prosecution was filed against Xu Zhiqing for knowingly marrying him and against Xu's uncle, Guan Chen, and matchmaker Xing Chunhua, for assisting in the bigamy. The court has repeatedly interrogated them, announcing that the cases will be combined for trial on the 13th. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. However, at the same time, Xu Zhiqing also hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a petition with the First Court, accusing Guo Luman, Han Yueling, Han Meisheng (Yueling's brother), and Wu Miaosheng (Yueling's brother-in-law) of the crime of fraudulent marriage. This fraudulent marriage case was originally scheduled for trial by Judge Wu Tingqi in the Second Criminal Court at 2:00 PM yesterday. However, because this case is also related to the bigamy case, it has also been rescheduled for simultaneous trial on the 13th. In addition, Guo Luman filed a case with the Civil Court of the Special Court against Guo Han for confirming her identity. It is rumored that it has also been scheduled for a combined hearing in the Civil Court on the morning of the 13th.</p>

<p>Rice Merchant Leader Zhu Zixiang Mediates Resolution</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 11th) at 10:00 AM, the patrol boat of the ship donation office of the Finance Bureau was inspecting and collecting donations at the rice industry's dedicated wharf in the South City. When they inspected the rice boat of Shen Xiangsheng, the owner was ashore, so the boatman Wang Yingsheng presented the ship's license and replied that the ship's donation would be brought from the shore to be paid by the owner. Unexpectedly, before the boatman could leave, two patrolmen suddenly used rattan canes to violently whip the boatman and rained punches and kicks on him, causing injuries all over his body. He cried out for help. The crowd at the wharf gathered upon hearing the sound, and everyone was outraged. The boat owners were planning to go on strike, but fortunately, rice merchant leader Zhu Zixiang noticed this and quickly dispatched a water police officer to mediate. He also made every effort to persuade and appease the boat owners to wait for a resolution. The two patrolmen who committed the assault have now been sent to the Water Patrol Team for transfer to the local court for punishment according to law, in order to appease the public.</p>

<p>(3) The Paper Dock Problem. This is a concern of the Qian industry, in light of the disastrous precedents of the ruble, mark, and the domestic warlord's abuse of paper money. Their concerns are well-intentioned, and we should not criticize them too harshly. Moreover, no one can guarantee that such situations will not recur in the future. However, history shows that the trend of economic evolution will inevitably lead to an era of credit, which is unavoidable. If we are afraid to use banknotes after seeing the previous failures, and even unwilling to switch to the silver yuan represented by banknotes, we would not only be acting out of fear of choking, but also be making something practically impossible. For example, when riding a car, if a car crashes, the focus should be on improving driving skills, not abandoning cars altogether. Therefore, if we want to prevent the abuse of banknotes after the conversion to yuan, we should study the system of issuance, how to maintain credibility and prevent abuse, and how to supervise the government and banknote issuers to avoid the dangers of a paper dock. This is the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Moreover, if banknotes can be abused after the conversion to yuan, can't Zhuang bills be abused before the conversion? Because it is a credit tool, and to say that banknotes representing silver yuan are prone to , while Zhuang bills representing silver taels must have sufficient cash reserves, is also untenable. Here are excerpts from Mr. Geng Aide's survey of the number of banknotes issued in Shanghai and the warehouse receipts of Chinese and foreign silver firms, listed in the table below for proof. (Large silver can also be minted into coins, so it is not included.)</p>
<p>Year | Silver in Reserve | Yuan in Reserve | Banknotes Issued</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>End of 1925 | 53,612,000 | |</p>
<p>End of 1926 | 70,570,000 | 68,980,000 |</p>
<p>End of 1927 | 57,210,000 | 78,450,000 |</p>
<p>Total Silver and Yuan | Total Amount | Silver Stored by Chinese Banks</p>
<p>------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Total Silver | 63,960,000 | 22,770,000</p>
<p>Total Yuan | 182,050,000 | 155,900,000</p>
<p>Assuming 7.2 mace equals one yuan, the average percentage of silver and yuan, Chinese banks account for 69.32%, and foreign banks account for 30.68%. Based on the above statistics, there are several points to note. (1) The inventory of silver taels in Shanghai's Chinese and foreign banks is decreasing, while silver yuan is increasing rapidly. (2) For the average inventory of silver and yuan, Chinese banks account for 69.32%,</p>
<p>. Foreign banks account for 30.68%. (3) Chinese banks hold more silver yuan, accounting for 85.63%, while foreign banks hold more silver taels, accounting for 62.83%. (4) At the end of the 19th year, the amount of banknotes issued was 271,000,000, and the silver yuan in reserve was 177,510,000. Even considering only Chinese banks and firms, there was a huge sum of 155,900,000 as of October 14th. It must also be explained that the banknotes of various Chinese banks are mostly circulating in the interior. For example, the Central Bank's banknotes represent the entire amount issued. The China Communications Bank also represents the total amount issued in several southeastern provinces, while the reserves only refer to those in Shanghai. (To be continued)</p>

<p>6. Considering the current situation, in terms of national defense, both we and the enemy can station troops in the hinterland of the Yangtze River and in the coastal ports. Perhaps we cannot station troops, while the enemy can, such as in the Three Eastern Provinces, Lushun, Dalian, and Vladivostok. The enemy has ports, while we do not. Successive governments have created such an unequal situation. Is it possible to neglect the need to enable each township and village to govern themselves, giving them the ability to save and defend themselves, to compensate for the shortcomings of national defense? Even if the big door has been opened, is it possible to set up more small doors and small households to prepare for it? Over the years and months, in the 17th year, 61,221,000 142,200,000</p>
<p>In the 18th year, 91,515,000 159,901,000</p>
<p>In the 19th year, 95,760,000 143,740,000 266,000,000</p>
<p>At the end of February in the 20th year, 93,097,000 146,540,000</p>

<p>At the end of the 20th year, 53,213,000 77,310,000 271,000,000</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang Naiqi in the article (Disorganized Financial Market) in the Bank Weekly, the percentage of warehouse receipts on October 14th of the 20th year is as follows.</p>
<p>Percentage | Yuan Stored by Foreign Banks | Percentage</p>
<p>------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>37.17 | 40,190,000 | 62.83</p>
<p>85.63 | 26,150,000 | 14.37</p>
<p>Each township and district, saving the wealth wasted on soldiers, could have one or two airplanes, anti-aircraft guns, and talent. Is it impossible to slightly salvage one in ten thousand? Respectfully offering this bitter celery that seeks no fame or profit, I secretly believe that the world has a Washington, and he will be willing to taste it.</p>
<p>Former US President Wilson once said (quoting Lincoln), "Justice creates strength." Since we deeply believe in it, we should make every effort to pursue it. I have a God-given confidence, which is the doctrine of self-government. The doctrine of self-government will now undergo the final test. Its purity and the power of its spirit are truly boundless. Now, it will be exposed to the world. The day when everyone struggles will come, and those who do not struggle should be eliminated from humanity. (See his letter to Congress on July 12, 1920) The reason why the doctrine of self-government is called pure and powerful is that it has no intention of exploiting the wealth and power of the people for the government, for the parties in politics, or for the lobbyists at home and abroad. It only seeks to enlighten the people's wisdom and morality, so that the world understands that our Yellow Farmer race has the morality and spirit to establish a nation, and cannot be whipped, enslaved, and controlled by the islanders who have received our culture.

<h3 id="e191">The Truth After Suicide <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>--- Buddha</p>
<p>Recently, China's national crisis has become increasingly urgent, and livelihoods have become increasingly difficult. Suicide incidents are frequently heard of. Resident Hongye, with the ambition to lament the world and pity the people, wrote the book (The Truth After Suicide) to persuade everyone. Based on scientific theory and citing abundant examples, every word is pertinent and can be called a masterpiece. If you wish to request a copy, please attach a one-cent postage stamp and ask the Nanjing Middle School Tutorial Department to obtain it.</p>
<p>Because of this book, I can't help but have a feeling about today's youth. The youth of our country today do indeed feel troubled, pained, and without a way out. However, this situation is not only true for the youth of our country, but also for the youth of other countries. Especially in China, where economic production is backward, that goes without saying. However, when examining the reasons for youth suicide recently, there are no more than two paths: one is economic oppression, and the other is love problems. Because the thinking of the general youth of today is very wrong, believing that life only counts as not being troubled and as having a way out if one lives in a Western-style house, rides in a car, and embraces a modern girl. This is a big mistake.</p>
<p>In the world today, to be a person, to beg for food is right, to be a coolie is right, to eat vegetable roots and live in small houses is right. Living in a Western-style house and riding in a car is originally an exception. The road that a person comes from out of hardship and difficulty is called a way of life. The road that is found with one's brains and energy is counted as a way of life. To sit on a family fortune or enjoy an existing business and eat comfortably is not called a way of life, it is called good fortune, it is called relying on blessings. Even in the past it was like this. There is an old saying (A great man can bend and stretch,) If one can only stretch and cannot bend, then one cannot be considered a great man. Look at the heroes of various countries, which one did not come out of struggle? If one were to seek a short life at the first setback, that is truly what women used to do, and what women today do not do. There is another old saying, (It is better to live badly than to die well) In fact, living badly is not very meaningful, because I was born a person, originally not only to consume bread, but to suffer hardships, and only after suffering hardships is there a way of life, but to find a way of life, one must first learn skills. If one does not learn skills and waits for happiness to descend, that is called abandoning oneself, and it is not a way of life.</p>
<p>As for committing suicide for love problems, it is even more of a joke. Love is originally a chance encounter. If you meet A today, you will fall in love with A. If you meet B today, you will fall in love with B. Is it possible that you will never fall in love with anyone if you don't meet A? Moreover, love is something that is active, changeable, and transferable. Therefore, the word love is not a problem in the first place. Not to mention that China is a country with no resources, even in the East and West, when it comes to marriage, one must be around thirty years old, which fits the ancient saying that at thirty one is strong and has a room. However, the ancients advocated late marriage from a physiological point of view, while foreigners advocate late marriage from a production point of view, because a perfect family requires a perfect economy to maintain. If you do not have the ability to produce, even if you have a modern girl, you will not only not get the happiness of love, but you will first suffer the pain of love. Conversely, if you have the ability to live, would you be afraid of not having a young and beautiful modern girl to accommodate you? If there is an inheritance left by your ancestors, that is an exception. If you are a young man who has no inheritance left by his ancestors, you should still try to study hard and enrich your tools for making a living, first find a bright and upright way out, and then slowly talk about love.</p>
<p>These words are not nonsense in front of you, I am also a person who is very qualified to commit suicide, I lost my education early, had a dictatorial marriage, and had no family property, so the conditions for suicide are all present, but now I am over fifty years old, and I am still struggling in the world. Not to mention suicide, even if Yama comes with a post to invite me, I will still fight him!</p>

<p>Don't say the scenery is good in Jiangnan, Jiang Liang only pities the apes and cranes, the red land has no home, the vermilion gate does not sleep, how can one share sorrow and joy, the vast waves have not dried up, how can one hesitate, to call on the magpies, the melancholy future, the sunset all the way shouting "gu e", precious treasures, ask the spring river what is the matter with the water flowing and the flowers falling, the sea guests talk about the distant Ying Island, the fools dream, what heart is it to steal medicine, the buildings are lonely, afraid that it will appear like a rare Udumbara flower, waiting to pick it without result, ten thousand calls and calls, hating the fact that the addiction is like yesterday.</p>

<p>Evening cooling down in summer, next door there is someone using radio broadcasting, writing this to entertain oneself</p>
<p>The painted curtains open, just as the evening coolness begins to permeate, the moonlight is like water, a little spiritual connection with electricity brings laughter, shrinking the earth amazes his divine skill, modulating clear peace, chanting the long hatred, faintly like the songs and dances of the city, the remaining charm of Jingting, the broadcasting is smooth and unparalleled. Regretfully recalling the previous wine opening, in those years listening to the music, why must we record the past, the silk and bamboo stop the clouds消永夜, suddenly惹起 new sorrow, sorghum is low, rain and clouds roll over, in vain waiting for the Yellow River to clear, the dripping is late, the person is tired, let's look for joy in sleep.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Fire Liquor <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Shuang</p>
<p>Fire liquor is the common name for methanol and ethanol, which are the most common of the monohydric alcohols. They have wide applications in industry, daily use, and medicine. Therefore, we will now discuss their manufacturing methods, properties, and so on:</p>
<p>(1) Methanol (CH2OH), also known as wood alcohol, is mostly obtained by dry distillation of wood in a vacuum under high heat. The distillate also contains acetic acid and tar. The tar can be removed by redistillation. Acetic acid can be neutralized with lime to form insoluble calcium acetate. What remains is 8% to 9% methanol and water. The water can then be removed by fractional distillation to obtain more concentrated methanol.</p>
<p>Recently, Germans have used steam and coal heated in a vacuum to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide (H2O + CH2 + CO). These two gases are then reacted using a catalyst and heating to 300-400 degrees Celsius to form methanol (CO2H2CH3OH). The methanol obtained by this method is cheap, but unfortunately, it is kept secret, and we cannot readily apply it yet. We still need to work hard ourselves!</p>
<p>Methanol is highly toxic, and drinking it can be life-threatening. Therefore, it can only be used in industry and other non-ingestible manufacturing.</p>
<p>(2) Ethanol (C2H3CH), also known as grain alcohol, is present in ordinary alcoholic beverages at a content of 15% to 50%. Its toxicity is less than that of methanol. The cheapest method of manufacturing it is to ferment starch into sugar, which is then fermented into ethanol. Making rice wine at home uses this method.</p>
<p>Ethanol can be drunk and has wider uses. Therefore, in countries with alcohol prohibition, in order to limit drinking, it is stipulated that ethanol must be mixed with methanol in order to be sold tax-free, otherwise it is subject to heavy taxes. Therefore, ethanol sold on the market contains one-tenth methanol. Obtaining pure ethanol is very expensive.</p>
<p>Some pharmacies often sell ethanol that has been mixed with methanol as pure ethanol. Purchasers who are unaware suffer greatly. To find out if methanol is present, pour half a test tube of wine into a test tube, and then slowly pour concentrated sulfuric acid along the tube wall, about one-third of the wine volume. The sulfuric acid will sink to the bottom of the tube. Then, gently add a few drops of ferric chloride solution. If methanol is present, there will be a purple ring between the wine and sulfuric acid layers, which is very obvious.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the uses of fire liquor: In industry, fire liquor is used as a raw material for making various items and as a solvent for water-insoluble substances. Various fragrances are extracted using fire liquor. In medicine, it has wide applications. Tincture of iodine is an alcohol solution of iodine, and various tinctures are extracts of drugs in ethanol. The value of fire liquor is more expensive than gasoline, so it cannot be used as a common fuel, but can only be used in the home.</p>
<p>We Chinese use fire liquor more and more every day. Except for a few alcoholic beverages, most of it is supplied by foreign countries, which is very regrettable. The method of making alcohol is not very difficult, and it is hoped that large capitalists will do their best to promote its manufacture.</p>

<h3 id="e195">A Scene in a Doctor's Office <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>A feeling of injustice is always suppressed by the word "poverty." Being sick is the most painful thing, especially for poor people. Of course, they don't have money to get treatment. Because of this delay, it's unknown how many lives are wasted! Although many charitable halls that provide medical consultations and medicine have been established in Shanghai society, they rarely have good effects on serious illnesses. Therefore, most doctors with greater skills have no choice but to put on airs, or not put on airs, but their signs cannot become famous. This is also an unfortunate thing for the poor in Shanghai!</p>
<p>The following is a scene of a poor person seeking medical treatment:</p>
<p>In the registration room of a doctor's office, a middle-aged woman came in. Her sallow face clearly showed malnutrition. Her hair was disheveled, and her eyebrows were deeply furrowed. Her short black cloth jacket had seven or eight patches, clearly showing that she was being oppressed by poverty!</p>
<p>The woman held a child of about two years old in her arms, who was almost skin and bones from illness. The child was crying loudly, and the veins on his head were bulging high!</p>
<p>"Sir! Can the consultation fee be reduced a bit? Please have some compassion and save this child's life!" The woman said to the registrar, pointing to the child in her arms.</p>
<p>"That's not possible!" the registrar said, glaring.</p>
<p>"Here are sixty cents! I pawned a short jacket this morning. Please make it easier for me!" The woman pleaded with a bitter face.</p>
<p>"Go sit over there, and after he's done examining other patients, he'll examine your child." The registrar hesitated for a long time before replying coldly.</p>
<p>"How much is the registration fee?" one of the patients asked. "Two dollars and forty cents," the registrar replied with a smile, very politely.</p>
<p>Only after several hours did the woman's child get examined. [The last one.] During these few hours, the woman saw how quick the registration was for others, while she [the last one] was met with several cold faces. How sad she was in her heart! However: A feeling of injustice is always suppressed by the word "poverty!"</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The XX Conservatory of Music is holding a recital tomorrow. Miss Ye is a top student at the school and has been chosen by the school authorities as a performer and is in charge of the (piano solo) program.</p>
<p>Indeed, she plays the piano very well. For example, she has already mastered (Sonata) and other relatively common pieces. Even Beethoven's (Moonlight Sonata) she was able to play a long time ago. She is preparing to show off this famous piece at the recital tomorrow, so in recent days, she has hardly dared to leave the piano.</p>
<p>Now she plays it again and again. Every time she thinks of the unparalleled honor she will inevitably receive tomorrow, she feels immense joy in her heart.</p>
<p>"(Miss Ye!)" This is a classmate's call. "(Your newly made dress has arrived, come and try it on)." So she hurried back to her room.</p>
<p>The long, floor-length black dress, worn on her petite body, is indeed very moving from behind, but the brown spots all over her face and her large, thick, protruding lips reflected in the mirror make even herself feel ashamed. However, she believes that if she uses miraculous makeup techniques, it can definitely be concealed. For example, first apply a thick layer of white powder, and then use (Xi Shi powder) to draw appropriately on the lips, and even paint the eye sockets gray-brown, wouldn't it be possible to get by if you look at it from a distance? So she still feels joy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a janitor came and said that the head of the piano department had called her to speak. When she walked into the faculty office, several classmates were already there. She walked up to the teacher, only to see the former Royal Academy of Music professor, a stateless White Russian with a full beard, cast a fierce glance over her, then shrugged his shoulders and frowned. After a long pause, the Royal Professor asked in a commanding tone:</p>
<p>"(Have you prepared your program for tomorrow?)"</p>
<p>"(I think I can handle it.)" She replied with confidence.</p>
<p>"(Humph?········)" He glanced at her again. Again, he shrugged his shoulders. His lips moved several times but no sound came out. Finally, he said decisively:</p>
<p>"(I think you don't need to attend tomorrow.)"</p>
<p>"(Ah! Why?)"</p>
<p>"(For no reason.······No, you will know yourself.)"</p>
<p>A wave of shame and anger swept over her heart, and she could still hear the snickers of her classmates in her ears. She retreated from the room dejectedly, overwhelmed with immense sorrow.</p>
<p>The next day she began to realize (The aristocratic professor is like this after all!)</p>
