<p>時評</p>
<h3>利器與熱血</h3>
<p>日本以一小民族。又常處於地震海嘯之自然迫害中。然而彼民族以一致之艱苦奮鬥。終於奠定其大和民族生存之基石。自維新以來。社會之建設。國家之組織。無不足以表示其爲現代之國家。而爲世界所樂爲稱道。尤以其軍國主義之厲行。軍備之完備。其海陸空軍與其軍事上之器械。無不爲最新式最科學而合於實用。所謂」堅甲利兵。「日本殆可當之無愧。宜乎彼太平洋中之島國。竟能位列三强。與英美分庭抗禮。吾人蓋不能不承認日本爲一近代化之新式國家也。</p>
<p>然而正以日本爲一近代新式國家之故。吾人乃滋爲日本惜。夫以如是佳美之新式國家。而無良好之近世神經司其指導。其大多數國民之婟性。竟爲一種恣横之國家主義所壓制。以一可能維護世界和平謀全人類之福祉。供獻其聰明才力爲天下先者。今不幸而變爲强横暴戾。之封豕長蛇。故吾人於。日本。可謂爲最新式之物。亦可謂爲最陳舊之物。可謂爲最佳美之國家。亦可謂爲最兇惡之國家。日本之堅甲利兵。不過爲其助長兇惡之工具耳。</p>
<p>正以日本民族無良好之近世神經司其指導。而徒爲驕恣暴横貪婪無厭之徒所刼持。故其堅甲利兵。毫不足畏。其軍隊皆爲械式的服從少數軍閥暴力之鞭策。而皆無現代新主義之信仰。與新生命之偉力。故利器雖多亦毫無足畏横暴强悍者。不必即爲與盛之民族。反之和平持重者。亦不必即爲衰老之民族。國家不必建築於强盛之軍旅。堅利之軍器此蓋吾人所深信而毫無可疑者也。</p>
<p>夫然故自上海禍變爆發。日本以陸海空三路强盛之軍力與最新式之利器。對我作拚命之進攻。歐西友邦人士作壁上觀者。都爲我慄危懼乃竟在我十九路軍英勇抗禦之下。毫不得逞。抑且每戰皆北。日人每幾我非現代國家者。今竟重創現代國家之日本。蓋彼雖有利器。而我則有熱血。我民族於極端隱忍之下。哀憤已上衝雲霄人奮必死之心。洒其熱血以維護公理正義與我民族之生命於斷續之俄頃。其足以抑制强暴伸張公理。蓋毫無可疑。此寳貴之熱血。即我民族生命所託。其光輝將永耀世界。培植公理與正義之長存。故吾人對於今日日本軍閥之壓迫。毫不置憂。暴力之來。亦惟有以民族之熱血洒之耳。」但求自助。不求人憐。「自我之熱血。終當贈予吾民族以最後之勝利。我國人其勉之。</p>

<h3>吳淞方面戰况</h3>
<p>敵軍海陸空會攻竟日　　　　我要塞陣亡士兵七名　　　　薀藻浜敵軍被我包圍　　吳淞方面、自昨晨八時許起、敵軍即派海陸空軍大舉會攻我軍陣地、我全線軍士、奮勇應戰、毫不爲動、結果敵軍仍被我撃敗、我要塞方面、僅陣亡士兵七名、而薀藻浜廟行鎭方面、有敵軍三千人、爲我軍包圍、全數解决、極有把握、茲將戰况詳情、分别紀述如後、</p>
<p>敵軍大舉攻吳淞敵軍艦三十艘、於昨日上午八時半、開始向我吳淞砲台進攻、同時並派飛機二十架、在空中投擲重量炸彈助戰、我要塞守軍、全綫沉着應戰、隆隆砲聲、竟日未停、敵軍雖用精良器械、由海空兩方壓迫、但我忠勇之軍士、毫不爲動、故敵軍雖盡全日之時間、向我轟撃、但結果仍不能得手、而我方亦僅陣亡士兵七名而已、</p>
<p>雙方互戰時情形大美晚報云、今晨（二十日）八時三十分起、日驅逐艦七艘、向吳淞砲台發砲猛轟、砲火自黄浦江口起、迄薀藻浜止、致有數處起火、黑烟瀰漫天涯、華軍初未回砲、至九時零二分鐘、華軍第一砲彈飛入浦江、其所落炸裂處、數分鐘前、有一日驅逐艦駛過、於是向張華浜方面日艦所泊處、連轟不已、今晨之砲戰、先由泊於張華浜鐵路碼頭之日驅逐艦夕張號發五吋口徑之大砲彈二枚、以爲猛轟之信號、旋有泊於淞口之驅逐艦第二十二號緩緩駛近吳淞砲臺、當距岸不及一百五十碼時、發砲一排、繼又發砲一排、岸上之兵、僅以機關槍與來福搶作答、槍彈掠汪而過、於是又有一驅逐艦即第二號、如前艦之所爲、是時岸上發出之機關槍彈益密、當第二十二號駛近張華浜鐵路碼頭對面　浦局產業時、浦東方面高橋之華兵、亦以來福搶猛轟、艦上答以機關搶、另有日水兵駕一拖船發來福搶助之、華軍發砲後、第二驅逐艦即讓第三驅逐艦發砲、旣而第四驅逐艦駛至、代前艦發砲無何、驅逐艦第二十二號又駛近蘊藻浜、向華軍陣地發砲數排、繼乃駛去、旋第二號第三號兩艦、又先後發砲畢、此數艦並小驅逐艦兩艘乃又聚轟片刻、現諸艦仍泊於薀藻浜正北起、首尾相接、直延至淞口、當砲轟時、有日飛機一架、翱翔吳淞天空、以事偵察、未擲炸彈、今晨十時、怡和公司之廣生輪船出口時、險中華軍之砲彈、搭客多立於後部艙面、是時機關槍與來福槍彈雖飛舞江中、而搭客並不避匿、實不明其故也、廣生船頭桅懸有紅旗、表示船中載有炸藥、而砲彈一枚、掠船首而過、落於江心、距船僅百五十碼許耳、十時十五分、自來水公司之小輪一艘、亦由彈雨中安然駛過、毫未受損、後四十五分鐘、大連丸亦駛過危險地帶而出口、其餘出口之船、則均折回、</p>
<p>敵三千被我包圍昨日上午、敵軍大隊沿薀藻浜向我軍陣地進攻、我軍略與抵抗、嗣即向後佯退、敵軍以爲我方放棄陣綫、遂突進我方陣地五六里至廟行鎭地方、計有三千人之多、我前綫之左右兩方軍士、當即將其後路截斷、此三千敵軍、遂被我軍包圍、刻將全數解决、我軍已極有把握、該日軍中、雜有俄人不少、又據本埠某機關張華浜工場主任西[ＩP&gt;前綫軍事長官自右至左（鄧鄂川（張炎）（朱紫朝）（鄭豐）</p>
<p>人、於四時四十五分以無線電話報稱、本日自晨至午後、中日兩軍作戰、其劇烈情狀、爲歷來所僅見、但華軍勇猛、較前愈形奮發、日軍因迭攻失利、仍有驚慌之象、至發電時、日軍約一千數百名、已被華軍包圍解决、日軍第一道防線、已爲華軍奪得、又據另一報告、下午一時三十分、在薀草浜方面日本陸軍、被我方包圍、日本海軍、急令吳淞外日本軍艦、開入浦江助戰、當有日本砲艦兩艘、由吳淞駛進、適太古公司長江輪武昌號、亦於此際同時進口、據在船之友人目覩當時情形云、兩日艦開抵薀藻浜時、聞日軍大隊、爲我軍包圍、兩日艦傳便發砲助戰、一連放二十餘砲、均不能命中、遂用硫磺彈、對岸上民房亂開、武昌輪各船員、目覩着彈房屋起火燃燒、而於前方戰事、絶無影響、武昌輪急切駛進、突聞我方回發兩砲、兩日艦幾被撃中、便倉皇逃走、</p>
<p>西報論兩軍陣勢大陸報云、昨夜滬上多數軍事家意見、日軍現已佈置就緖、準備大舉進攻、但其兵數、以與富有潛藏勢力之敵人相遇、守固有餘、進攻尙嫌不足、目下日軍實力、約共二萬人、（按泰晤士報謂有三萬人）分佈於一萬五千碼之戰綫、當薀藻浜之南、京滬鐵路工廠内配置兩大隊、有步兵一千二百人、砲隊兩小隊、每隊野砲四尊、一隊爲七生的半口徑、一隊爲十生的半口徑、其南則泗塘河邊置步兵一隊、周家橋附近亦有步兵一隊泗涇橋考夫球會之西、配置兩隊、而於球會前大路與翔殷路交點處、則置步兵兩大隊、蓋此區亦爲日方配置重兵之所、更南在江灣方棚間之東、近鐵路處置步兵兩大隊、靶子塲西北方配置一大隊、北車站附近亦爲重兵所駐、據稱、分佈沙袋後者、共有一聯隊之衆、其大部份則集中北四川路　　江路一帶、　又其骑兵在薀藻浜附近、有三隊、每隊約一百名、至日軍總數、除砲隊人數、及配置地點、未能探悉外、據聞工程隊有四百五十名、雜務隊亦四百五十名、連步兵五千四百五十名、併計其第九師團實力、約共八千八百五十名、外加海軍陸戰隊約七千名、及第九師調滬以前、先到之一平時編制之師團約五千名、總共二萬人左右、惟聞不日尙有數萬日軍開來、昨晨十一時、有驅逐艦與巡洋艦十三艘駛出吳淞、向日本開駛、諒即係保護運兵艦之用、據昨夜最可靠消息、證以東京電訊、大約在明日夜間至下星期二之間、將有二三師團開到、此項師團、係戰時配置、每師團約有二萬人之譜、以故中日兩軍、雖於昨夜俱已佈置完畢、準備大戰、仍有許多人預料日方或將俟此項援軍開到後、再行大舉總攻撃云、</p>
<h3>江灣方面戰况</h3>
<p>敵三次衝攻均經撃退　　　　地雷燬敵坦克車四輛　　　　我軍先鋒隊達平凉路　　昨晨七時二十分、日軍下總攻撃令後、全線均有激戰、而敵之戰略、係側重於江灣、企圖切斷我軍之連絡、昨日江灣血戰結果、燬敵坦克車四輛、敵不支、潰退、我軍乘勝追撃、昨晚七時、我先鋒部隊到逹平凉路、各情分誌如下、</p>

<p>八字橋敵大潰昨晨七時起、日兵首先向閘北進攻者、爲八字橋方面日兵、先以大砲向該處我軍防地轟撃、但我軍均伏處戰壕、不動聲色、亦不還撃、日兵乃於九時許、以坦克車十餘輛、步兵二千餘名、向八字橋進攻、步兵均尾於坦克車後、我軍即以機關槍射撃迫撃砲隨之、敵兵仍利用坦克車、猛烈進衝、我軍乃抛擲手溜彈、同時敵方飛機、亦在空助戰、大砲密發、我軍在彈雨之下、益奮勇迎撃、待敵坦克車衝入火綫時、我軍即以手溜彈引發地雷、轟然一聲、敵坦克車二[ＩP&gt;江灣民房大火一（王小亭攝）</p>
<p>輛、即爲炸燬、敵兵死傷狼藉、血流成渠、我軍乘勢反攻、敵兵不支、紛向原路奔逃我軍恐有埋伏、固守原防、祗用步槍追射至十一時許、敵兵又用砲轟、但均未中的、未傷我軍分毫、我軍問亦以迫撃砲鋼砲還撃、至下午二時稍殺、三時後、日兵又圖反攻、因此雙方又起激戰、但敵方因晨間受挫後、已露畏縮情態、故祗在原防綫内射撃我軍沉看應戰、日兵不敢前進、乃漸平息、結果、我軍大捷、敵兵傷亡四百餘名、燬去坦克車二輛、</p>
<p>天通庵路敵敗退日兵於進攻八字橋後、即於十時許、向天通庵路我軍防綫、同樣進攻、槍砲互射、密如連珠、敵兵視爲唯一利器之坦克車、屢圖衝散我軍防綫、惟我軍手溜彈炸彈、密如雨點、齊集敵兵坦克車上、同時我軍、多從戰壕中躍出、猛烈前衝、敵坦克車恐受圍撃、亟亟後退、敵兵胆寒、乃亦且戰且退、所用爲掩護衝鋒之坦克車、乃變而爲掩護敗退之用、敵傷亡者二百餘名、至下午二時許、敵又圖襲撃、我軍即伏於戰壕内應戰、但敵軍至距離約三百米突地點、即不敢前進、互相對峙、約二小時、敵因不得逞而敗退、</p>
<p>邢家宅路敵受挫昨日下午一時許、日兵以八字橋及天通庵路、先後失敗、乃急急抽派陸軍四百餘名、鐵甲車十餘輛、由邢家宅路新民路、在飛機野砲掩護之下、向北站進襲、至寶山路口、吾軍突出應戰、一面抛擲手溜彈、一面以機槍横掃、敵人驚惶四竄有一小部份、由鴻興路向東逃去、被寶興路吾防軍迎頭痛撃、悉數殲滅、義品里之南屍骸狼藉、敵偷襲不成、張脈憒興、北河南路底與靶子路北、同時以大砲轟般吾軍陣地、吾亦發砲還撃、至二時後、完全以砲作戰、隆隆之聲、二十分鐘始息、聞靶子路口日人所設之大砲兩門、完全爲吾軍撃毁、</p>
<p>西寳興路激戰日兵旣敗於八字橋、又敗於天通庵路、再敗於邢家宅路之後、猶圖作困獸之鬥、於下午五時一刻左右、重調精銳、向我西寳興路進攻、我軍早已嚴陣以待、俟敵進衝、即予痛撃、日兵乃改用鐵甲車衝鋒、又爲我軍手溜彈逼退、敵方大砲、頓向我軍轟撃、但多中於民房内、且未炸裂、我軍乘勢進撃、同時手機關槍盒子砲迫撃砲步槍手溜彈鋼砲、齊向日兵陣綫集撃、敵兵在我方砲火威逼之下、漸覺不支、傷亡枕籍、後援無應、乃逐步敗退、我軍因戰略關係、仍守原防、</p>
<p>佔領敵司令部昨日日兵以大砲轟撃我軍陣線者、均發自虹口靶子塲及狄思威路日司令部方面、但我軍還砲準確、曾予敵兵後方以巨創、因此在昨晨間、敵兵陣綫、確起變化、未幾敵兵援軍開到、乃得勉强支持陣地、至中午、狄思威路日兵司令部、被我砲撃燬、靶子塲方面敵兵砲位、有被壓迫放棄之勢、砲聲從未間斷、至下午六時三十分左右、我砲隊又將狄思威路敵兵砲基轟燬、同時天通庵路我軍乘機追撃、敵砲兵因步兵失却抵禦力、節節敗退、乃亟圖携砲退却、但我軍已追到、當爲我軍奪獲山砲六門、敵司令部、即被我軍佔領、沿途敵兵死屍狼藉、滿衢血斑、刻我軍尙在分途夾撃中、</p>
<p>大美晚報紀載大美晚報云、今晨（二十日）八時十三分、日砲隊開始以開花彈轟撃閘北、其炸裂處、輒在目的物天空一二百呎、日軍之砲轟、顯欲試探華軍砲位之所在、日砲彈雖落於華軍回砲處之區域、撃中房屋、而華軍陣線、並未受有影響、日轟炸飛機兩架、曾於八時三十分飛起、在寶山路擲下炸彈兩枚、繼即飛去、以讓砲隊作戰、中國砲隊、曾於晨間九時、發彈數枚、惟砲火最烈處、則在華軍前綫以輕砲回轟虹口日軍砲火處、今晨自十時起、至正午止、日軍分兩處發砲、一由靶子塲與虹口、砲轟商務書館之東方圖書館舊址、歷一小時始已、一由江灣附近砲轟閘北北區、且用引火砲彈、致起火三處、今晨日軍砲轟之際、華軍似未回砲、僅以來福槍機關槍向敵軍發砲之地猛射、以防日兵沿寳山路一帶衝撃、據外國軍事家之意見、日軍用尋常之戰法、終難得有進步、觀今晨日軍之砲轟、仍不離乎故智、將來大戰、必爲大規模之巷戰、肉搏之際、兵精數衆者、必佔上着云、</p>

<h3>Weapons and Ardor</h3>
<p>Japan, a small nation, often faces natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. Yet, through unified and arduous struggles, they have established a foundation for the survival of their Yamato people. Since the Meiji Restoration, their social construction and national organization have been sufficient to demonstrate their status as a modern nation, admired by the world. Especially noteworthy is their rigorous implementation of militarism and the completeness of their military preparations. Their army, navy, and air force, along with their military equipment, are all the latest, most scientific, and practical. They can be described as having "strong armor and sharp weapons" without any doubt. It is fitting that this island nation in the Pacific can stand among the three great powers, competing with Britain and America. We cannot but acknowledge Japan as a modernized and new-style nation.</p>
<p>However, precisely because Japan is a modern and new-style nation, we feel sorry for Japan. Such a beautiful and new-style nation lacks proper modern sensibilities to guide it. The narrow-mindedness of most of its people is suppressed by a kind of unrestrained nationalism. A nation that could have contributed its intelligence and talent to the world for the sake of maintaining world peace and seeking the welfare of all mankind has unfortunately become tyrannical and violent, a great boar and long serpent. Therefore, when it comes to Japan, we can say it is the newest and the oldest, the best and the most vicious. Japan's strong armor and sharp weapons are merely tools to aid its viciousness.</p>
<p>It is precisely because the Japanese nation lacks proper modern sensibilities to guide it and is held hostage by arrogant, tyrannical, greedy, and insatiable individuals that its strong armor and sharp weapons are not at all fearsome. Its troops are merely mechanical followers, driven by the whips of a few military cliques, and lack belief in modern new ideals and the power of new life. Therefore, despite having many sharp weapons, they are not at all fearsome. The violent and aggressive are not necessarily a thriving nation; conversely, the peaceful and prudent are not necessarily a declining nation. A nation need not be built on a strong army and sharp weapons. This is what we firmly believe without any doubt.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, Japan has launched a desperate attack on us with its strong army, navy, and air force and the latest weapons. Western friendly nations, watching from the sidelines, trembled with fear for us. However, under the heroic resistance of our 19th Route Army, they have been unable to succeed and have been defeated in every battle. The Japanese have often considered us a non-modern nation, but now they are severely wounded by modern Japan. They may have sharp weapons, but we have ardor. Our nation, after extreme forbearance, has had its sorrow and anger rise to the heavens. People are determined to die, shedding their ardor to uphold justice and the life of our nation in this fleeting moment. Their ability to restrain violence and promote justice is beyond doubt. This precious ardor is what our national life depends on, and its brilliance will forever illuminate the world, cultivating the long-lasting existence of justice. Therefore, we are not at all worried about the oppression of the Japanese military cliques today. Faced with the arrival of violence, we can only sprinkle it with the ardor of our nation. "Seeking self-reliance, not asking for pity." Our ardor will eventually grant our nation the final victory. Our countrymen, strive for it!</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>The Great Battle Begins, Our Army Victorious</h3>
<p>Enemy troops attacking Miaohang are surrounded by our army. Enemy troops were repelled three times in their attacks on Jiangwan. Enemy forces were defeated in their four-pronged attack on Zhabei. Two enemy planes were shot down at Dachang Miaohang. Enemy Commander Kenkichi Ueda, after receiving our reply on the evening of the 19th, did not announce the contents to his officers. Instead, at 7:20 AM yesterday, he issued a general attack order, using the full force of the army, navy, and air force to launch a massive attack on our Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei lines at 7:30 AM. Our side was well-prepared for this attack, so when the enemy attacked yesterday morning, our troops resisted bravely and did not retreat. Although the enemy attacked with all their might throughout the day, they were ultimately repelled by our army. Our front line remained unchanged. The fighting was fiercest in the Jiangwan area, where the enemy used more than 20 tanks to cover large groups of infantry, charging three times but being repelled by our army. Four tanks were destroyed by our landmines. At 5:30 PM, a fire broke out in the enemy's position on Dalianwan Road, disrupting their lines. Our army seized the opportunity to attack, and the enemy retreated in defeat. Our forces pursued them until about 7:00 PM, with our vanguard advancing to Pingliang Road. In the Zhabei area, the enemy used more than 10 tanks to cover infantry in an attack at 9:00 AM, but they were repelled, and two tanks were destroyed by our landmines. At around 10:00 AM, there was also fierce fighting on Tiantong'an Road. By 6:30 PM, the enemy artillery retreated towards Dixiwei Road, and our army seized six mountain guns. On Xibaoxing Road, the enemy attacked us at 5:15 PM but was repelled by our army by 6:30 PM. In Wusong, starting at 8:30 AM, 30 enemy warships and 20 aircraft attacked our forts throughout the day. Our troops calmly responded, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. In the Yunzaobang area, 3,000 enemy troops were surrounded by our army in Miaohang Town and were completely dealt with. Our army is very confident. Enemy aircraft flew to our army's positions to drop bombs, and two were shot down by our anti-aircraft guns at Dachang and Miaohang. However, many of our civilian houses were bombed and set on fire. The war situation obtained from various routes yesterday are summarized as follows: The 19th Route Army headquarters reported a victory, addressed to provincial governments, telegraph bureaus, newspaper offices, and organizations. The report is as follows: (1) At around 10:00 AM this morning, the enemy army, with more than 10 tanks in front and more than 1,000 infantry following, attacked our Baziqiao position in Zhabei. Our army remained silent in the trenches, waiting for the enemy to approach before detonating landmines, destroying two enemy tanks and causing the remaining enemy to collapse and retreat. (2) At 8:00 AM this morning, more than 3,000 enemy soldiers attacked our position near Miaohang Town. Our army calmly responded and is currently in contact. At the same time, an enemy plane was shot down. (3) At 12:35 PM on the 20th, Japanese warships in the Wusong area fired many shots at us, but none hit. (4) At the same time, in the Maojiaqiao area near Dachang, several Japanese aircraft flew in to drop bombs. One was shot down by our army on the spot, and the four bombs attached to the plane did not explode. Issued by the 19th Route Army headquarters (10:00 PM on the 20th).</p>
<p>A telegram of victory from the Longhua Headquarters, addressed to the Military and Political Department of the Garrison Commander's Office and all relevant parties. This morning, the enemy launched a general offensive against us with artillery, aircraft, machine guns, tanks, and armored vehicles. Fierce battles occurred especially at Baziqiao, Jiangwan Station, Jiangwan Town, and Miaohang Town. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and we destroyed five enemy armored vehicles and shot down one enemy plane. In Wusong, more than 30 enemy warships and more than 20 aircraft bombed us, but our defending soldiers suffered minimal losses. Further details will follow. Respectfully submitted, Staff Office of the Songhu Garrison Command, stamped on the 20th, 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Wusong</h3>
<p>Enemy army, navy, and air force launch a combined attack throughout the day. Seven soldiers were killed in action at our fortress. Enemy troops in Yunzaobang are surrounded by us. Since 8:00 AM yesterday, the enemy army has launched a combined attack on our army's positions from the sea, land, and air. Our soldiers bravely responded and did not waver. As a result, the enemy was still defeated by our army. Only seven soldiers were killed in action at our fortress. In the Yunzaobang Miaohang Town area, 3,000 enemy soldiers were surrounded by our army and will be completely dealt with. We are very confident. Detailed accounts of the war situation are described separately below.</p>
<p>Enemy Launches a Large-Scale Attack on Wusong. Thirty enemy warships began attacking our Wusong forts at 8:30 AM yesterday, while 20 aircraft dropped heavy bombs from the air. The soldiers of our fortress calmly responded to the battle and the booming of guns did not stop all day. Although the enemy used sophisticated equipment to put pressure from both the sea and the air, our loyal and brave soldiers did not waver. As a result, the enemy failed despite attacking for the entire day, and our side only suffered seven soldier deaths.</p>
<p>Situation During Mutual Fighting, According to the Greater Shanghai Evening News, "Starting at 8:30 AM this morning (the 20th), seven Japanese destroyers heavily bombarded the Wusong forts, with gunfire extending from the mouth of the Huangpu River to Yunzaobang, causing several fires and black smoke filling the sky. The Chinese army did not initially return fire. At 9:02 AM, the first Chinese shell flew into the Huangpu River, and where it exploded, a Japanese destroyer had passed minutes before. Then, the shells relentlessly bombarded the Japanese warships parked near Zhanghuabang. The cannonade this morning was initiated by the Japanese destroyer Yubari, docked at the Zhanghuabang railway pier, firing two five-inch shells as a signal for the heavy bombardment. Subsequently, the destroyer No. 22, docked at the mouth of the Song River, slowly approached the Wusong forts, firing a volley when it was less than 150 yards from the shore, followed by another volley. The soldiers on the shore responded only with machine guns and rifles, the bullets skimming across the water. Then, another destroyer, No. 2, did the same as the previous ship. At this time, the machine gun fire from the shore became even denser. When No. 22 approached the Pujiang Industry opposite the Zhanghuabang railway pier, the Chinese soldiers at Gaoqiao in Pudong also bombarded it with rifles, to which the ship responded with machine guns. Japanese sailors driving a tugboat also assisted with rifles. After the Chinese army fired, the second destroyer let the third destroyer fire, and then the fourth destroyer arrived and took the place of the previous ship. Before long, destroyer No. 22 sailed near Yunzaobang and fired several volleys at the Chinese army's positions, then sailed away. Then, Nos. 2 and 3 fired successively. These ships and two small destroyers then gathered and bombarded for a moment, and now the ships are still anchored just north of Yunzaobang, end to end, extending straight to the mouth of the Song River. During the bombardment, a Japanese plane soared over the sky above Wusong to carry out reconnaissance without dropping bombs. At 10:00 AM this morning, when the Yihua Company's Guangshun ship was leaving the port, it narrowly avoided a Chinese shell. Many passengers stood on the aft deck. Although machine gun and rifle bullets were flying in the river at the time, the passengers did not avoid or hide, the reason for which is unclear. The Guangshun's bow mast had a red flag indicating that the ship was carrying explosives, and a shell flew past the ship's bow and landed in the river, only about 150 yards from the ship. At 10:15 AM, a small ferry of the waterworks company also passed safely through the rain of bullets without being damaged. Forty-five minutes later, the Dalian Maru also passed through the dangerous area and exited the port, while the other ships that had left the port all turned back."</p>
<p>Three Thousand Enemies Surrounded by Us Yesterday morning, a large enemy force advanced along Yunzaobang towards our army's positions. Our army briefly resisted and then feigned a retreat. The enemy thought we had abandoned our positions and suddenly advanced five or six li into our positions to Miaohang Town, numbering as many as 3,000 people. The soldiers on the left and right sides of our front line immediately cut off their retreat. These 3,000 enemy soldiers were then surrounded by our army and are now about to be completely dealt with. Our army is very confident. It has also been confirmed that many Russians were mixed in with the Japanese troops. In addition, Mr. Xi [IP&gt; the Director of the Zhanghuabang Factory of a certain institution in this port reported by wireless telephone at 4:45 PM that the battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies from morning to afternoon was the most intense ever seen, but the Chinese army was braver and more vigorous than before, and the Japanese army still showed signs of panic due to repeated failures. At the time of the telegram, about 1,000 or so Japanese soldiers had already been surrounded and dealt with by the Chinese army, and the Japanese army's first line of defense had been seized by the Chinese army. According to another report, at 1:30 PM, the Japanese army in Yunzaobang was surrounded by our side, and the Japanese navy hurriedly ordered Japanese warships outside Wusong to enter the Huangpu River to assist in the battle. As two Japanese gunboats sailed in from Wusong, the Taikoo Company's Yangtze River liner Wuchang happened to be entering the port at the same time. According to a friend on the ship who witnessed the situation at the time, when the two Japanese ships arrived at Yunzaobang and heard that a large force of Japanese soldiers had been surrounded by our army, the two Japanese ships immediately opened fire to assist in the battle, firing more than 20 consecutive shots, none of which hit. They then fired sulfur shells indiscriminately at civilian houses on the shore. The crew of the Wuchang saw houses hit and set on fire, but this had no effect on the battle in front. The Wuchang urgently moved forward, when suddenly two shots were fired from our side, and the two Japanese ships were nearly hit and fled in panic.</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Discuss the Positions of the Two Armies According to the Continental Press, the opinion of most military experts in Shanghai last night was that the Japanese army has now been deployed and is preparing to launch a major offensive. However, their troop numbers are sufficient to defend against an enemy with potential strength, but not enough to launch an attack. At present, the Japanese army's strength is approximately 20,000 people (according to the Times, there are 30,000 people), distributed along a 15,000-yard line. Two battalions are stationed south of Yunzaobang, inside the Jinghu Railway Factory, with 1,200 infantry soldiers and two platoons of artillery, each platoon with four field guns, one platoon being seven-centimeter caliber and one platoon being ten-centimeter caliber. To the south, a platoon of infantry is stationed along the Sitang River, and another platoon of infantry is near Zhoujiaqiao. West of the Sijingqiao Kauf Club, two platoons are stationed, and at the intersection of the main road in front of the club and Xiangyin Road, two battalions of infantry are stationed, as this area is also where the Japanese have heavily deployed troops. Further south, to the east between Jiangwan and Fangpeng, near the railway, two battalions of infantry are stationed. Northwest of the Shooting Range, one battalion is stationed, and the vicinity of the North Station is also heavily garrisoned. It is claimed that there is a regiment's worth of troops distributed behind sandbags, most of them concentrated in the Beisichuan Road and Jiangwan Road area. In addition, their cavalry near Yunzaobang consists of three platoons, each with approximately 100 men. As for the total number of Japanese troops, in addition to the number of artillery troops and the location of deployment not being able to be ascertained, it is said that there are 450 engineering corps members and 450 service corps members, plus 5,450 infantry members, making the strength of the 9th Division approximately 8,850 people. In addition, there are approximately 7,000 naval landing forces and one pre-war regular division of approximately 5,000 people who arrived before the 9th Division was transferred to Shanghai, totaling approximately 20,000 people. However, it is heard that tens of thousands more Japanese troops will arrive soon. At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, thirteen destroyers and cruisers sailed out of Wusong and headed towards Japan, presumably to protect troop transport ships. According to the most reliable information last night, confirmed by Tokyo telegrams, approximately two or three divisions will arrive between tonight and next Tuesday. These divisions are wartime formations, each division with approximately 20,000 men. Therefore, although both the Chinese and Japanese armies have completed their deployments last night in preparation for a major battle, many people still expect that the Japanese will wait for these reinforcements to arrive before launching a major general offensive.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Enemy attacks repelled three times. Landmines destroy four enemy tanks. Our vanguard reaches Pingliang Road. After the Japanese army issued a general attack order at 7:20 AM yesterday, there was fierce fighting along the entire line. The enemy's strategy focused on Jiangwan, attempting to cut off communication between our troops. The result of the bloody battle in Jiangwan yesterday was the destruction of four enemy tanks. The enemy was unable to withstand and collapsed and retreated. Our army took advantage of the victory and pursued, and at 7:00 PM last night, our vanguard reached Pingliang Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Four Enemy Tanks Destroyed After the enemy issued a general attack order at 7:20 AM yesterday, the enemy army on Jiangwan Road first used six aircraft to reconnoiter our positions and drop bombs. At 6:00 AM, the enemy made contact with our front-line sentries. At the same time, the enemy heavily bombarded our positions with artillery. After 8:00 AM, more than 3,000 enemy soldiers, led by more than 20 tanks, fiercely attacked the defense line in the Xitiyuhui Road area of Jiangwan Road. Our army fiercely counterattacked and then engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The fierce battle lasted until about 12:00 PM, when the enemy gradually could not withstand it. At the same time, the enemy's tanks hit our army's landmines and were destroyed on the spot. The enemy's morale was thrown into chaos, and they collapsed and retreated. Our army took advantage of the victory and pursued, and the enemy died in heaps, annihilating approximately 800 or more people. After 1:00 PM, more than 2,000 enemy soldiers attacked the same location for the second time. The sounds of guns and artillery filled the air, and the battle was extremely fierce. After suffering a loss in the morning, the enemy's morale was already low. After being severely attacked head-on by our army, the enemy was unable to withstand it after fighting until about 3:00 PM and collapsed and retreated. After 7:00 PM in the evening, the enemy attacked for the third time. After fighting until 9:00 PM, they were repelled by our army again. As a result of the fierce fighting throughout the day yesterday, in addition to destroying four enemy tanks, we also seized a large number of other spoils of war.</p>
<p>Vanguard Reaches Pingliang Road At 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a fire suddenly broke out in the enemy's line on Dalianwan Road in Jiangwan Road. The enemy thought they were attacked by our army and scattered in panic. Our army took advantage of the opportunity to pursue. The enemy resisted stubbornly. At 7:00 PM last night, our vanguard reached Pingliang Road, approaching the Japanese army's headquarters. In addition, at approximately 9:00 PM last night, there were thirteen fires in the enemy area in the Yinhanggang area. For a time, the fire illuminated the sky, and more than ten trucks, full of enemy corpses, were transported to Yangshupu, which shows the large number of enemy casualties yesterday.</p>
<p>Large Fire Near Jiangwan Station The battle in Jiangwan yesterday was extremely fierce, with the two armies advancing and retreating. The artillery of both sides was particularly active. The enemy fired more than a thousand shells throughout the day. As for the enemy's aircraft, six aircraft arrived in Jiangwan starting at 6:00 AM yesterday and dropped bombs everywhere. At about 7:00 AM, several civilian houses in the Wan'an Bridge area caught fire due to sulfur bombs, and flames could be seen as far as Dachang. The flames in Jiangwan reached the sky, and several civilian houses near the Jiangwan Station also caught fire.</p>
<p>Enemy Uses Flame Throwers The 9th Division, commanded by Kenkichi Ueda, is known as the most elite unit of the Fukuda Division. After being deployed to Shanghai, it is prepared for a desperate struggle. It is heard that Ueda's general attack this time, seeing that close combat and rushing attacks resulted in losses, has changed his strategy and adopted chemical attacks to suppress our army. However, whether or not to use poison gas is still being considered. It has now been confirmed that the group brought a "flame thrower" shaped like an ordinary briefcase, containing compressed gas and fuel, specially used for incendiary attacks at night. After being fired, the flame can reach a distance of fifteen meters, causing great harm to our army and reducing its combat capability. It is also learned that the soldiers in white who landed at the Huangpu Wharf last time were the operators of the flame throwers. However, our army has already learned about this and has taken appropriate precautions.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Drops Gas Basins At 9:10 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese army used an aircraft to drop several hundred gas basins near Dachang. These gas basins are made of white cloth on top and white paper on the bottom, containing drugs inside. After landing, they explode, turning into dense smoke. The local villagers reported this upon seeing it and it is currently being studied (presumably the ones dropped by the aforementioned flame thrower).</p>
<h3>War Situation on the Zhabei Front</h3>
<p>Two Tanks Destroyed 　　　　Six Mountain Guns Captured 　　　　Enemy Headquarters Occupied.</p>
<p>The Japanese army launched a general offensive on Jiangwan and Wusong. At about 9 o'clock yesterday morning, they simultaneously attacked Bazibridge, Tiantong'an Road, Xingjiazhai Road, and Xibaoxing Road in Zhabei, using airplanes, artillery, and tanks to cover infantry assaults. The Japanese army's two artillery bases at Hongkou Training Ground and Dixiwei Road fired all day, but to no effect. On the contrary, our army destroyed the Japanese army's headquarters on Dixiwei Road, capturing six mountain guns. On the Bazibridge front, two enemy tanks were destroyed, and countless enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. Our army's front line made progress in the Tiantong'an area, with no other changes. The war situation on each road in Zhabei is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Greatly Routed at Bazibridge</p>
<p>Starting at 7 o'clock yesterday morning, the first Japanese soldiers to attack Zhabei were those on the Bazibridge front. They first used artillery to bombard our army's defensive positions there, but our soldiers all lay in the trenches, remaining silent and not retaliating. At about 9 o'clock, the Japanese soldiers, with more than ten tanks and over two thousand infantry, advanced towards Bazibridge. The infantry followed behind the tanks. Our army immediately fired with machine guns, followed by mortars. The enemy soldiers continued to use tanks to charge fiercely. Our army then threw hand grenades, while enemy planes also assisted in the air, and artillery fired densely. Our army, under the rain of bullets, fought even more bravely. When the enemy tanks rushed into the firing line, our army detonated landmines with hand grenades. With a loud bang, two enemy tanks were destroyed. The enemy soldiers suffered heavy casualties, and blood flowed like rivers. Our army took advantage of the situation to counterattack. The enemy soldiers, unable to withstand, fled in disarray along their original route. Our army, fearing an ambush, held its original defense, only using rifles to pursue and shoot until about 11 o'clock. The enemy soldiers then bombarded again, but none of the shots hit, and our army suffered no damage. Our army also retaliated with mortars and steel cannons. The fighting subsided slightly until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. After 3 o'clock, the Japanese soldiers attempted to counterattack, so fierce fighting broke out again. However, the enemy, having been defeated in the morning, showed a frightened attitude, so they only fired within their original defense line. Our army watched calmly and responded, and the Japanese soldiers did not dare to advance, so it gradually subsided. As a result, our army won a great victory, with over four hundred enemy soldiers killed or wounded and two tanks destroyed.</p>
<p>Enemy Retreats on Tiantong'an Road</p>
<p>After attacking Bazibridge, the Japanese soldiers launched a similar attack on our army's defensive line on Tiantong'an Road at about 10 o'clock, with guns and cannons firing at each other as densely as a string of pearls. The enemy soldiers, regarding tanks as their only effective weapon, repeatedly attempted to break through our army's defensive line. However, our army's hand grenades and bombs rained down on the enemy soldiers' tanks. At the same time, many of our soldiers jumped out of the trenches and charged forward fiercely. The enemy tanks, fearing encirclement, retreated hastily. The enemy soldiers were terrified and retreated while fighting. The tanks, which were used to cover the assault, were now used to cover the retreat. More than two hundred enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. At about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy attempted to attack again, but our army lay in the trenches to respond. However, the enemy soldiers did not dare to advance to a point about 300 meters away, and confronted each other. After about two hours, the enemy retreated in defeat because they could not succeed.</p>
<p>Enemy Suffers Setback on Xingjiazhai Road</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 1 o'clock, after the Japanese soldiers failed at Bazibridge and Tiantong'an Road one after another, they hastily dispatched more than 400 infantry and more than ten armored vehicles, under the cover of airplanes and field artillery, to attack the North Station from Xingjiazhai Road and Xinmin Road. At the Baoshan Road intersection, our army launched a surprise attack, throwing hand grenades and sweeping with machine guns. The enemy scattered in panic. A small part fled east along Hongxing Road and were met with a fierce attack by our defending forces on Baoxing Road, and were completely annihilated. Corpses were scattered in a mess south of Yipinli. The enemy's sneak attack failed, and they became agitated and flustered. At the end of Beihe South Road and north of Bazilu Road, they simultaneously bombarded our army's positions with artillery. We also fired back. After 2 o'clock, the fighting was entirely artillery-based. The rumbling sound only subsided after twenty minutes. It was reported that two large cannons set up by the Japanese at the Bazilu Road intersection were completely destroyed by our army.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting on Xibaoxing Road</p>
<p>After the Japanese soldiers were defeated at Bazibridge, Tiantong'an Road, and Xingjiazhai Road, they still attempted to put up a desperate struggle. At about 5:15 in the afternoon, they redeployed their elite troops to attack our Xibaoxing Road. Our army had already been waiting in a strict formation, ready to launch a fierce attack as soon as the enemy advanced. The Japanese soldiers then changed to using armored vehicles to charge, but were again forced back by our army's hand grenades. The enemy's artillery then bombarded our army, but mostly hit civilian houses and did not explode. Our army took advantage of the situation to advance, while simultaneously firing machine guns, Mauser pistols, mortars, rifles, hand grenades, and steel cannons at the Japanese soldiers' positions. Under the threat of our artillery fire, the enemy soldiers gradually felt unable to withstand, suffering heavy casualties and receiving no reinforcements. They gradually retreated. Our army, due to strategic considerations, still held its original defense.</p>
<p>Enemy Headquarters Occupied</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese soldiers who bombarded our army's positions with artillery all fired from the Hongkou Training Ground and the Japanese headquarters on Dixiwei Road. However, our army's retaliatory fire was accurate and caused great damage to the enemy soldiers' rear. Therefore, yesterday morning, the enemy soldiers' positions did undergo changes. Before long, enemy reinforcements arrived, and they were able to barely maintain their positions. At noon, the Japanese soldiers' headquarters on Dixiwei Road was destroyed by our artillery fire, and the enemy soldiers' artillery positions at the Training Ground showed signs of being suppressed and abandoned. The sound of artillery never ceased. At about 6:30 in the afternoon, our artillery again destroyed the enemy soldiers' artillery base on Dixiwei Road. At the same time, our army on Tiantong'an Road took the opportunity to pursue and attack. The enemy artillery, because the infantry had lost their ability to resist, retreated step by step, and hastily tried to retreat with their cannons. However, our army had already caught up and captured six mountain guns. The enemy's headquarters was then occupied by our army. Enemy soldiers' corpses were scattered along the road, and the streets were covered in blood. At the moment, our army is still attacking in multiple directions.</p>
<p>Report in the "Shanghai Evening Post"</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that at 8:13 this morning (the 20th), the Japanese artillery began to bombard Zhabei with explosive shells, which exploded one to two hundred feet above the target. The Japanese artillery bombardment was clearly intended to probe the location of the Chinese army's artillery positions. Although the Japanese shells fell in the area where the Chinese army returned fire, hitting houses, the Chinese army's front line was not affected. Two Japanese bombers took off at 8:30 and dropped two bombs on Baoshan Road, then flew away to let the artillery fight. The Chinese artillery fired several shells at 9:00 in the morning, but the fiercest artillery fire was from the Chinese army's front line, which used light artillery to return fire at the Japanese artillery fire in Hongkou. From 10:00 this morning until noon, the Japanese army fired artillery from two locations: one from the Training Ground and Hongkou, bombarding the old site of the Oriental Library of the Commercial Press for an hour; the other from near Jiangwan, bombarding the northern district of Zhabei, and using incendiary shells, which caused three fires. While the Japanese army was bombarding this morning, the Chinese army did not seem to return fire, but only fired rifles and machine guns at the area where the enemy army was firing, to prevent the Japanese soldiers from charging along Baoshan Road. According to the opinion of foreign military experts, the Japanese army will ultimately find it difficult to make progress using ordinary tactics. Looking at the Japanese army's bombardment this morning, it is still the same old trick. The future battle will definitely be a large-scale street fight. In a melee, the side with more soldiers will definitely have the upper hand.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Airplanes Shot Down by Our Forces</h3>
<p>Fearing Our Artillery Fire, They Fly Very High　　　　Indiscriminately Drop Bombs Wherever They Fly　　　　Causing No Damage to Our Battle Lines　　　　Only Innocent Civilians Suffer Damage</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Japanese army used all its naval, land, and air forces to attack our side. Enemy planes, from 7:00 in the morning, flew to Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, Zhenru, and other places to scout and drop bombs. However, our army was prepared and used anti-aircraft artillery to bombard the enemy planes, which did not dare to fly low, dropped bombs indiscriminately, without any targets, and caused no damage to our army. Those who suffered were all civilians. Yesterday, according to reports from various sources, six people died from enemy plane bombs and fifteen were injured. The cruelty of the Japanese is evident. Fortunately, our army has sufficient experience in the use of anti-aircraft artillery. Two enemy planes were shot down at Dachang and Miaohang. The war on the front line is also very smooth. The compatriots who died can rest in peace in the afterlife. Yesterday, due to the fierce fighting, many people were injured by stray bullets, which is also recorded below.</p>
<p>Two Japanese Planes Shot Down</p>
<p>At 7:30 yesterday morning, twelve Japanese planes flew from the Jiangwan area to scout over Zhenru, circling for about a quarter of an hour. Because our army's anti-aircraft artillery, machine guns, and rifles fired together, the enemy planes did not dare to drop bombs and fly low, and then went to the Dachang area. When six planes reached Maojia Bridge in the town, one was shot down by our army's anti-aircraft artillery. There were still four heavy bombs in the plane, none of which exploded. The remaining planes fled in panic. At about 2:00 in the afternoon, two Japanese planes flew to Zhenru again, at a height of over 1,800 feet, and quickly flew away from the town. According to news from our army, at about 8:00 yesterday morning, more than 3,000 enemy troops near Miaohang attacked our army's positions. Our army responded calmly. By the afternoon, both sides were in contact and stalemate. At that time, one enemy plane was shot down by our army.</p>
<p>One Enemy Plane Crashes</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Drop Bombs at Dachang</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, enemy planes flew out from the east at about 8 o'clock. Most of them were bombing. First they were in Jiangwan, Bazibridge, Qingyun, and our army's positions. Then they flew to Xiang, and by 10 o'clock, seven planes were in Wu and five planes went to . They were behind me and along the Shanghai-Tai Road. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency in front of the , heard three or four loud noises in the car. At first, he thought it was from the car, but then he looked up and saw three enemy planes flying . To Dachang, and two planes flying lower, seemingly wanting to fire machine guns. The reporter then ordered the car to stop to see what was happening. As soon as he got out of the car, several residents rushed out of a narrow path to the left of the Dachang bus station, saying that the □□ temple had been bombed. So he asked them to lead the way, and within fifty steps, he saw that the wall in front of the temple had collapsed, and some of the temple buildings had also collapsed. Looking at it, there were a total of three holes, four of which were near the temple and facing the small river, and on the right was the Xiaoshi Bridge of Pingjiang. Two holes were on the bank in front of the temple, and one hole was in the middle of the river, so half of the small bridge was buried in mud and half was destroyed by the bombing. The two sides of the bridge, which were large stone slabs, were not broken, but had changed direction and could barely be walked on. About twenty houses on both sides of the river had collapsed due to the shock.</p>
<p>Boatman's Wife and Daughter Tragically Killed</p>
<p>The most tragic was that Ren Puyou had a boat moored next to the bridge. After being bombed, the boat was buried in the soil, and Ren's wife and daughter were buried in the soil. Ren was lucky to escape, and only suffered a scratch on his forehead, which was not serious. But he kept telling people about his wife and daughter, as if his mind had been frightened. Other deaths and injuries were difficult to determine because the residents had fled, so there was no way to start digging. According to passers-by, a total of six bombs were dropped on Dachang, four of which hit civilian houses and two of which hit barren fields.</p>
<p>Enemy Plane Damaged and Flees</p>
<p>After the Guowen News Agency reporter finished inspecting, he heard several loud noises again in the east, which came from the Majia Bridge area, only four miles away from Dachang. So he went further ahead and learned that at 10:20 in the morning, enemy planes came to drop bombs, more than fifteen or sixteen of them, all of which landed in open areas. Two bombs destroyed several civilian houses, killing and injuring five residents. When the enemy plane was circling in the sky, its wing was hit by our anti-aircraft artillery, but it fell to only five or six feet above the ground and still managed to escape. The reporter originally planned to go to Yanghang, but when he arrived five or six miles away from Dachang, he saw that the small wooden bridge had been bombed and destroyed, so he had to turn back. It was said that the bridge was intentionally bombed and destroyed when the enemy planes first came in the morning, so seven or eight planes circled above the bridge and dropped six or seven bombs in total. After achieving their goal, they flew away. But on the way back, the reporter saw a carload of wood going to repair it, and it was soon restored to its original state. One person was injured there. The details of the bombing in Liuhang, Gujiazhai, and Luodian were not clear. The enemy planes at Dachang did not fly to Jiangwan until 1:30 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Tang Bridge Bombed and Repaired</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 9 o'clock, several Japanese planes were scouting and dropping bombs everywhere above our army's defense line. The Tang Bridge between Dachang and Gujiazhai was bombed and destroyed. Engineers went to completely repair it in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Drop Bombs in West Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 9:40, three Japanese planes flew again in the West Shanghai area, soaring in the sky, circling everywhere, and dropping a large number of bombs, more than thirty of them. It is known that the places bombed include: ㈠ Yejiazhai on Connaught Road, where a bomb was dropped, which immediately exploded. A local villager, He Shunfa, 35 years old, was immediately bombed to death. A man and a woman, surnamed Wu, were injured in the face and feet, and were taken to the hospital for treatment. The place is very close to the British barracks on Difeng Road. ㈡ Beicaojiazhai on Bailinan Road, where a bomb was dropped, injuring a boy. ㈢ North of Fanhuangdu Creek, north of Sun Yat-sen Road and north of Great China University, where three bombs were dropped. A local woman, Zhang Chen, 31 years old, was injured in the head and chest, and died instantly. Two bungalows were also destroyed. ㈣ Tanzhawan in Zhabei, where six or seven bombs were dropped. Three thatched sheds of poor people from Jiangbei there were bombed and caught fire, and were burned to ashes in an instant. An old woman was injured. ㈤ North of Xiaoshadu Creek, on the bank of Suzhou Creek, where a bomb landed and did not explode.</p>
<p>Many Killed and Wounded in Zhabei</p>
<p>Yesterday morning after 9 o'clock, the Japanese army fired large shells, which exploded in the sky north of New Zhapu Bridge, and fell at the end of Haichang Road, destroying houses No. 11 and 12 in Renshou Lane, injuring five people and killing one person. A large shell fell on Gonghe New Road, killing one pedestrian and injuring three people. Near Song Park Road on Zhonghua New Road, more than twenty thatched sheds in Jiangbei were destroyed, injuring two women and one man. Near Qingyun Road on Tiantong'an Road, five shells fell, only two of which exploded, destroying seven or eight houses, without injuring anyone.</p>
<p>Stone Bridge Hit and Destroyed</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 10:10, a small stone bridge on the Zhabei Shanghai-Taicang long-distance highway, north of Dachang (about half a mile from Dachang), was bombed and destroyed by Japanese planes. At that time, a car of a certain automobile company was planning to go to Liuhang, but when it drove near Dachang, it suddenly heard the sound of guns and cannons, as dense as a string of pearls. After the car passed Dachang, there were five Japanese planes in the sky, carrying more than ten bombs, and the sound of explosions was loud, and thick smoke rose. Seeing that the stone bridge in front had been bombed and destroyed, the car immediately turned around and fled. Fortunately, the place was desolate, and the bombs fell on the ground, creating huge holes.</p>
<p>Factories and Shops Suspended Operations</p>
<p>In West Shanghai, Caoyangdu, Robison Road, Jessfield Road, Zhoujiaqiao, and the area north of the creek, the Shenxin Yarn Factory, Zhentai Yarn Factory, Lida Flour Factory, Zhonghua Industrial Factory, and various wood factories, sock factories, and shops selling paper, firewood, rice, soy sauce, salt, etc., all created by Chinese businessmen, had already started operations a few days ago. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, a large number of Japanese planes suddenly circled in the sky there, dropping bombs indiscriminately. Therefore, various factories and shops, in order to avoid danger, immediately suspended operations. People were panicked and stayed indoors, afraid to go out.</p>
<p>Three Shells Land in Zhenru</p>
<p>Yesterday morning after 9 o'clock, the enemy fired artillery from Jiangwan and Jianggan, and three shells landed next to a temple east of the Zhenru train station, about four zhang away from the temple. Two shells exploded, and one did not explode. Because the shells landed in the fields, no one was injured.</p>
<p>Summary of Deaths and Injuries from Stray Bullets</p>

<h3>Fires Reported Everywhere</h3>
<p>Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wenzaobang, etc.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Japanese army began a general offensive against our army, and at the same time, Japanese planes also went out to drop bombs everywhere. The Japanese army also used incendiary bombs to attack our rear. As a result, our army did not suffer any major losses, but civilian houses were destroyed and burned everywhere.</p>
<p>In the Zhabei area, although Japanese planes dropped bombs in the morning, they did not start fires. It was not until 1:15 in the afternoon that the Japanese army used incendiary bombs to attack our rear, numbering several hundred. Civilian houses on Baotong Road and Chuan Highway caught fire, and the fire was so bright that it lit up the sky and spread rapidly, not subsiding until about 4 o'clock. Other places such as Guangdong Street, Baoshan Road, and Qiujiang Road were also bombarded, but fortunately there were no disasters.</p>
<p>Great Fire in Jiangwan</p>
<p>The Japanese army, relying on its sharp artillery fire, fired aimlessly. From 10 o'clock in the morning, fires were reported again. By 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the fire was getting bigger and bigger. It was said that hundreds of civilian houses had been burned down.</p>
<p>Wenzaobang Town and Jiangwan were the general offensive areas of the Japanese army. The rumbling of artillery never ceased all day, and the enemy planes also dropped bombs, burning down hundreds of houses.</p>
<h3>Iron and Blood Reply to Japanese Ultimatum</h3>
<p>The generals of the 19th Route Army sent a telegram to the National Government, military and civilian officials of all provinces, and the people of the whole country: Brutal Japan disregards our national government and uses the despicable trick of instigating and spreading rumors, violating common practice, and sending a barbaric ultimatum to our army alone. Our army can only reply with iron and blood. Soldiers serve the country, and to die for it is our duty. The day the war begins is the day our army is ordered. As long as there is one soldier and one bullet left, brutal Japan will never succeed. We only hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will have the will to die, and regard seeking a life of shame as the greatest disgrace, uniting and fighting one after another. Then the sacrifice of our army will not be in vain, and the soldiers who die in battle will smile in the afterlife. Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army Jiang Guangnai, Army Commander Cai Tingkai, Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji, Division Commanders Shen Guanghan, Mao Weishou, Qu Shounian, Deputy Division Commanders Li Shengzong, Zhang Yan, Tan Qixiu, Brigade Commanders Liu Zhanxiong, Deng Zhicai, Zhang Li, Weng Huiteng, Huang Gu, and all officers and soldiers kowtow together.</p>
<h3>City Government Responds to American Consul's Protest</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Uses Concession as Base to Attack Our Army</p>
<p>Who is Responsible for Endangering Residents' Lives and Property?</p>
<p>The other day, the American consul sent a letter to the city government, stating that shells had fallen on the Jiangonghe Wharf, injuring British sailors and killing nearby residents. He requested that the right to claim compensation be reserved for the future. It is heard that the city government has already replied. The reply letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Respectfully, we received your letter of February 17, stating that shells had recently fallen on the Jiangonghe Wharf owned by British merchants, causing serious injuries to two British naval soldiers stationed there, killing two Chinese people, and injuring seven Chinese people. After observing the direction from which the shells came, it is suspected that they were fired by the Chinese army. Please inform your country's military authorities to avoid such misunderstandings, and declare that the right to demand compensation is reserved. Upon receipt of this, it is found that this incident is unfortunate. However, before the source of these shells has been thoroughly investigated and proven, our country's authorities cannot acknowledge any responsibility. Furthermore, this mayor sent a letter to your consul general on February 8, expressing a serious protest regarding the concession authorities' tolerance or failure to prevent the Japanese army from using the concession as a base to attack our country's army. It was also strongly stated that if the concession authorities do not take effective measures in this regard, then the Chinese army, for the sake of self-defense, when attacking the Japanese army that is using the concession as a military base, our country's government will not be responsible for any damage suffered by the lives and property of foreign nationals. However, no effective measures have been heard from the concession authorities to this day to prevent Japan's destructive behavior in the concession, which endangers the lives and property of our country and other countries' people. Recently, Japanese reinforcements have again, with the indulgence of the concession authorities, landed in the concession and calmly deployed to attack our country's military and civilians, which your consul general must be aware of. Therefore, this mayor must reiterate the previous instructions to clarify responsibility. Regarding the letter received, please note."</p>
<h3>Public Opinion in the Great American Evening Post</h3>
<p>The Fault Lies Not with China, But with Japan. Yesterday's editorial in the Great American Evening Post stated: "Those who constantly provoke trouble with guns always get what they want. China's strong refusal is in fact initiated by Japan itself. However, the price of the authority of the Japanese militarists must be borne by our public, which is incomprehensible." Indeed, we are now all under Japan's aggressive "self-defense" guarantee. Japanese Chief of Staff Tashiro said, "The crisis in the concessions and the unrest of the residents have reached their extreme. Therefore, we cannot afford to delay the opportunity any longer." However, there is one point that Tashiro and other Japanese spokespersons cannot announce to the world: the crisis and unrest in the current situation are not the fault of China, but of Japan. We often feel that internal chaos in China is enough to endanger us. Japan even wants to use our habitual way of thinking, but the facts are too obvious. (1) Japan's aggressive actions in Manchuria are the cause of the current tense situation in Shanghai. (2) Japan's misconception that the Hongkou area is Japanese territory is the source of all current conflicts. (3) The Shanghai Municipal Council only announced martial law after Japan made demands. (4) The Japanese army's misjudgment in entering Chinese territory is the starting point of the real war. (5) Japan's bombing of Chinese territory and various violent acts not only affected the Chinese territory, but also the Chinese in the concessions, creating an unforgivable situation for Japan. (6) As of now, due to the initial failures of the Japanese Marines, Japan has had to mobilize large numbers of troops, causing China to encounter indecent and irregular coercion. Knowing the causes of the above, the reasons for Japan's provocation can be known. This morning, a certain newspaper said, "In any dispute, one party must compromise. However, according to common practice, the weaker party often retreats first." (The reporter understands that this is the argument of yesterday's editorial in the Shanghai Times.) However, after making this statement, a certain newspaper suddenly defended itself, claiming that it did not advocate "might makes right," and also stated, "China is not without friends. If it can negotiate with Japan sincerely and openly, China has no need to be afraid." This is truly an entanglement in thinking, which is the reasoning commonly used by the Japanese, and they want to lead us to have the same thoughts. The newspaper further stated, "The Chinese army has the right to station troops on Chinese soil, which is undoubtedly true. However, it is doubtful whether it is rational for the Chinese army to refuse to leave to the death. (Sighs) (Original as is)" In other words, the Chinese army has the right to station wherever it is, regardless of whether it is close to foreigners or not. However, China is weaker than Japan, so it should retreat when faced with Japanese threats. However, China's retreat is not because it is weaker than Japan, but because China has many friends abroad, so it may as well compromise on Japan's ideal open and honest transactions, because friendship is a kind of comfort, etc. The Japanese are also trying their best to argue that the Manchurian Incident is not related to the Shanghai Incident. These two events cannot be discussed on the same day due to the difference between non-resistance and resistance. However, we can loudly proclaim without hesitation that the Manchurian Incident and the Shanghai Incident are both self-sought imperialist behaviors by Japan. The wording of China's reply has made Japan's various sophistries even more obvious, like the finishing touch of painting a dragon. The mutual withdrawal of troops by China and Japan is enough to achieve Japan's declared goals. If they want to pretend to be victors at this time, it is impossible. As for the anti-Japanese movement, it should be resolved through legal means. The Chinese government should restrict anti-Japanese behavior through legal means. However, without thinking about clearing its source and stopping its cause, how can the Chinese government guarantee the cessation of anti-Japanese actions? Furthermore, to disarm China's national defense is truly an extreme demand. If another country asks Japan to disarm its own national defense, we can imagine what Japan's response would be. The Chinese government's declaration that the Chinese army does not usually station in Shanghai is also very appropriate, because this time it was the Japanese army that harmed the Chinese people, not the Chinese army that harmed the Japanese people.

<h3>Eternal Unity, Sincere Spirit</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen's Reply to Xue Dubi Song Ziwen's letter to Xue Dubi states: "To my esteemed friend, Mr. Ziliang, the country has been in turmoil, and we have not heard from each other for a long time. Now, in the midst of artillery fire, I received your letter, reading it over and over again, I cannot help but feel emotional. The violent Japanese have invaded, and the only price we have obtained with tears, blood, and unparalleled sacrifices is the word 'unity.' We will permanently hold this spirit of unity, clearly identify the only enemy to save ourselves, and there is no room for contention of will, nor opportunity for discord. The various doubts and accusations against the government in your letter can be found in the conversations of Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the Commander of the Army in the Shanghai newspapers of the 20th of this month. Furthermore, the rumors are completely unintentional, the questions cannot be answered, and there is no need to . People are concentrating artillery fire to attack our army defending the territory. If our loyal armed comrades who are are scattered across the wilderness were all comrades of the 19th Route Army, the people of the country would rise up to accuse the government, and the government would have no way to defend itself. If not, even if the government does not seek understanding for the moment, how can it comfort the loyal souls who died for the great cause in the afterlife? The ancient saying goes, 'Governing is not about much talk,' let alone military affairs. Humbly accepting your enlightenment, I dare to express my humble opinion. I wish you good health. Your brother, Song Ziwen, February 20th."</p>
<h3>Citizens in War Zones Should Move Immediately</h3>
<p>City Government's Proclamation Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Government issued a proclamation to ensure the safety of citizens in the war zone, stating: "Proclamation: Since January 28th, when the Japanese army invaded our territory, heavy artillery and airplanes have bombarded our prosperous streets, and countless people have suffered harm to their lives and property. Recently, they have made unreasonable demands on our 19th Route Army and the government, which have been strongly rejected. Since the Japanese army despises justice and indulges in violence, our country will resist for self-defense and will definitely fight to the end. Therefore, all citizens living near the war zone should temporarily evacuate to avoid being harmed by the Japanese army and to ensure their safety. In addition to repeated on-the-spot notices to the military and police, this proclamation is hereby issued, and all citizens in this urban area are expected to comply."</p>

<h3>Three Yarn Factories in the Concession Were Damaged by Japanese Artillery Shells Yesterday</h3>
<p>Five Workers Injured, Temporary Shutdown At 9:30 AM yesterday, the Japanese army fired dozens of artillery shells southwest from the Tientong'an area in Zhabei, fiercely attacking our army. Five explosive shells landed in the western part of Shanghai, two in the Tongyi Yarn Factory in the concession, one in the Puyi Yarn Factory, and two in the Dafeng Yarn Factory in the Chinese territory. A reporter from the New Times Agency went to investigate, and the following is the report:</p>
<p>Tongyi Tongyi Yarn Factory, No. 10 Moganshan Road, West Shanghai, is a Chinese-owned enterprise. Because the factory is in the concession, it has been operating as usual in recent days. The river area and the factory are guarded by American soldiers. At 9:30 AM yesterday, while the factory was in operation, an explosive shell from the Japanese army came from the east. One shell landed on the third floor of the factory's southern staff dormitory, immediately blasting off a corner of the south side, with tiles flying and glass windows and walls all damaged. Because it was during working hours, the staff were not inside, so there were no casualties. One shell landed in the warehouse, blasting a large hole more than five feet wide in the wall. The American soldiers stationed in the factory, who were hit directly, immediately retreated to another location and telegraphed the police station, headquarters, and consulate. They sent personnel to investigate and picked up the fragments of the exploded shells as a basis for negotiation. All the workers in the factory temporarily stopped work to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Puyi Puyi Yarn Factory, No. 10 Xianlu Road (formerly the first factory). At 9:30 AM, while the workers were working, a an explosive shell landed. The factory was blasted into a hole. The sound of the explosion injured a guard. Tang Di, a 42-year-old worker who was clearing flowers; Ji Wanren; Li Zhao, 23 years old, from Jiangsu; Wen Cai, 31 years old, from Taizhou; Zhang Shaofu, 40 years old, were all injured slightly. They immediately went to the Red Cross Hospital. After being bandaged, they returned to the factory. The factory director, Zhu Huilin, said that the police station and headquarters had sent personnel to investigate and pick up the exploded shells. The workers in the factory were panicked for a while, so they stopped working. Because the workers were timid, the factory may stop working for several days. This place is a concession, a U.S. military garrison area. The U.S. soldiers were very angry at the Japanese army's bombing of the concession. After receiving the report, the U.S. consul has sent personnel to investigate everything and will reportedly protest to the Japanese consul.</p>
<p>Dafeng Two explosive shells also landed at the Dafeng Yarn Factory on Bingbei Tanzai, Tokyo Road, destroying two small factory buildings. Because the factory is located in the Chinese territory and has been closed for a long time, no one was injured.</p>
<h3>Condolence Messages</h3>
<p>Sixty-First Division Thanks Fellow Countrymen A public note to the elders, brothers, sisters: The country is in trouble, and the powerful enemy is aggressive. The Japanese bandits are unscrupulous and extremely invasive. The people have suffered their oppression and humiliation for more than a day or two. Recently, they have become even more aggressive, rampaging wildly. They have already occupied our Eastern Provinces and plundered our Shanghai. Their animalistic behavior aims to completely annex our Republic of China. Our army bears the heavy responsibility of defending the territory and fights back in self-defense. They have shed blood for weeks, killing over ten thousand enemies. Although their work is not yet complete, they have avenged the national hatred even by a small amount. Our fellow countrymen across the country mourn the impending doom of the nation and share the same hatred of the enemy. They have given material rewards and provided spiritual encouragement. We are surprised and grateful, and their kindness is overwhelming. We have received deep love and care, which increases our determination to kill the enemy. We must continue our efforts to completely eliminate the Japanese atmosphere. Even with one soldier and one bullet left, we will never turn back, so as to fulfill our duty as soldiers and repay the great expectations of our fellow countrymen. We must promote our national prestige and restore our national rights. We hope that our dear fellow countrymen will prepare for a long-term struggle and provide continuous assistance, make plans with a do-or-die attitude, and seek a permanent solution. Sacrifice will surely have its price, and justice will eventually crush the powerful enemy. This is our earnest hope, and we extend our gratitude. Special Party Department of the Sixth-First Division of the Army of the Chinese Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>Overseas Filipinos Continue to Remit $25,000 The China and South Sea Bank has received another remittance of over $25,000 from overseas Chinese in the Philippines to General Cai Tingkai of the 19th Route Army in the past two days. This includes $4,000 from the Chinese Merchants' Medical Association, $300 from the Mydong Ya Shi Yi Sheng Company, $4,200 from the various National Salvation Associations in Gapite, $3,500 from Baguio, $3,000 from Sulo, $4,260 from various groups, $2,000 from Brazil, $1,000 from the second batch from Dansheng Manwan, $1,000 from Los Banos, $730 from Gapeede Yin Lan Nai, $700 from Mashimiaodi, and $800 remitted from Xiamen to Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai. All of these amounts have been transferred to the 19th Route Army Office by the bank.</p>
<p>Chinese Employees of the Municipal Council Enthusiastically Contribute Since its establishment, the General Association of Chinese Employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council has taken consistent action with various external organizations in matters concerning the country. For example, last year, when the Japanese bandits massacred Korean compatriots, there were major floods in Wuhan, and Ma Zhanshan's isolated army resisted the enemy, all of which generated large sums of money to provide assistance. However, all of this was published in the association's monthly magazine, "The Association". Therefore, few outsiders know about it. It is reported that this time, when the Japanese bandits invaded, our 19th Army fought desperately against the enemy, and various organizations in Shanghai have donated money for rewards. The association has also taken action. It is reported that the various associations have donated more than 1,800 yuan, and the source is still coming in. It is said that the donated money will be sent to the Banking Association for forwarding to the generals at the front. They are considering a monthly contribution of five percent to sustain the effort. The Chaozhou Fellow Association Continues to Express Gratitude. On the 19th, the Chaozhou Fellow Association in Shanghai donated seven kinds of food to Brigade Commander Weng, and also rewarded the soldiers of the 156th Brigade with 5,000 jin of white rice, 100 jin of salt, three vats of pickled vegetables, and 100 jin of salted meat.</p>
<p>Catholics Send Gifts One After Another The Shanghai Catholic Women's Thrift Association also prepared military canteens, silk wadded vests, woolen neck warmers, gloves, and other items a few days ago, and sent them to the 19th Route Army Office to express gratitude to the soldiers at the front. They also send personnel to various hospitals every day to express gratitude to the wounded soldiers and donate food. The Catholic Youth Association has also launched a campaign to prepare consolation items, which will soon be sent to the 19th Route Army Office.</p>

<p>The Wives of Chen and Jiang Console the Wounded Soldiers Yesterday afternoon, Mrs. Chen Mingshu, Mrs. Jiang Guangnai, and Mrs. Deng Duanren and her daughters went to the No. 2 Hospital of the Red Swastika Society to console the wounded soldiers. Hearing the moans of the soldiers, they couldn't help but shed tears. They then personally distributed a white flannel shirt and pants, a can of milk, a towel, and silk wadded vests and Guangju oranges to each wounded soldier. Afterwards, accompanied by the staff of the Swastika Society, they went to Guangci Hospital and distributed the items to the fourteen wounded soldiers who had been transferred by the Swastika Society a few days ago. The wounded soldiers were all grateful and thanked them in unison. At the same time, Mr. Wang Feiwen of the Great Eastern Dispensary also donated 40 packages of biscuits and 80 cans of corned beef to the wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Various Bureaus and Offices Forward Consolation Items The Joint Office of Various Bureaus of the Municipal Government received 200 sets of white short shirts made by Renhe Hospital and Shangxiantang Hospital, Jun Sujun of Hongsheng Cloth Shop, and seven boxes and 336 cans of braised beef from Mrs. Wang. The office has forwarded these items to the 19th Route Army Office to express gratitude to the soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>The Consolation of the Citizens' Maintenance Association On February 16, the Shanghai Temporary Local Maintenance Association also sent Yang Youxian to the Orthopedic Hospital to express gratitude to fifteen wounded soldiers and one platoon leader, and to the Shanghai Red Cross General Hospital to express gratitude to one battalion commander, one company commander, four platoon leaders, one special service chief, and forty-two wounded soldiers. Each wounded officer received a consolation prize of four yuan, and each wounded soldier received one yuan. On February 12, Yang Youxian escorted two repaired freight vehicles donated by Chen Diaoyuan and handed them over to Tang, the director of the transportation office at the Zhenru front.</p>
<p>Songjiang Communities Donate Hemp Sacks Last night, the Shanghai Radio Broadcasting Station reported that the 19th Route Army wanted to collect ten batches of hemp sacks. Upon hearing this, the Songjiang County Party Department immediately joined hands with all sectors of society to donate. As of yesterday, 164 large hemp sacks, totaling more than 3,000, had been collected to donate to the 19th Route Army. The Songjiang County Party Department specially sent Lu Changlin and Wu Guofang to transport them to Shanghai, and the Shanghai Municipal Party Department sent Zhang Cangsu to assist in transporting them to the front. The Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce and the National Disaster Temporary Relief Association jointly donated 53 pieces, totaling more than 1,600, which were also transported to Shanghai by Lu and Wu and sent to the 19th Route Army for use.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Continues to Collect Consolation Items The General Office of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Collecting Consolation Items (inside the Ningbo Fellow Association on Tibet Road), the Second Branch Office (inside the Cotton Cloth Industry Association), and the Third Branch Office (inside the Mineral Ash Factory Industry Association) have collected the following items donated by various sectors of society. On February 18, they received 751 yuan in cash, 900 yuan in bank notes, 16 yuan in small silver coins, 6 dozen anti-glare glasses, 5 hemp sacks, 200 rice tickets, 6 boxes of S&amp;W apples, 50 pieces of fermented bean curd, 2 bolts of flannel, and 200 sets of cloth shirts and pants. On February 19, they received 1,250 yuan in silver dollars, 4 jiao in small silver coins, 119 silk wadded vests, 200 oilskins, 14 pickaxes, 97 gas masks, 100 hemp sacks, 1 telescope, 1,000 cigarette tins, and a total of 2 large packages, 4 baskets, and 2 boxes of New Year's cakes, biscuits, and other foods, 100 packs of cigarettes, 104 white cloth pants, 4 pairs of socks, 2 sets of small shirts and pants, 150 thermos bottles, 12 coal forks, 10 dozen gloves, and 240 bottles of first aid medicine. The above items have been collected and transferred separately. The names of all donors are being compiled and will be published in the newspaper one after another.</p>
<p>Opinions on Consoling Soldiers Mr. Wang Dihui wrote a letter saying, "Dear Sir, Ever since the violent Japanese disaster in Shanghai, it has been more than ten days in an instant. The soldiers at the front are loyal and brave in resisting the war, and the compatriots who have been afflicted are displaced. The two things of comforting the army and relieving the disaster are the most urgent tasks. I dare to offer my humble opinion, and the following is a list of the articles: (1) The best way for residents is to use the alley as a unit, and the best way for shops is to use the industry association as a unit. Each unit can launch its own donation campaign, collect a certain amount, and send it to the collecting agencies for separate transfer. (2) Cash is good, goods are good, and it is also good to contribute effort without money. Each should do what they can without restrictions. (3) Ten yuan is good, one yuan is good, one jiao and one cent are also good. Do what you can, regardless of the amount. (4) Water bottles are good, towels are good, toothbrushes are good, and toothpaste is also good. Just seek to be practical and don't dislike being expensive or cheap. (5) The more collecting agencies the better. Post the addresses and office hours in detail in the newspaper for easy delivery nearby. After I have requested the Asia-British Company and other radio stations to broadcast the propaganda, the alleys in various places will actually implement it, and the results are very good. For example, there are only ten residents in Ping'an Lane where I live, but in one or two days, more than 150 yuan in cash has been collected, and the value of the goods is estimated to be more than 300 or 400. If your newspaper allows this to be published, then it will definitely promote it more quickly. This is a special letter, and I wish you all the best. This newspaper, January 20."</p>
<p>This Office Collects Consolation Items and Cash The United States Minneapolis Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association wired 7,500 silver dollars to the 19th Route Army through the United Transportation Company. The Sijing District Office and the Town Chamber of Commerce sent 500 silver dollars, and said that they are still continuing to solicit donations and will send them as soon as they are collected. It can be seen that the people there are enthusiastic and patriotic, because that place is a small town in Songjiang that can get such donations. Mr. Chen Xuquan and the female volunteer group Chen Jinli and Lei Peizhen, etc., initiated a collection to make silk wadded vests and cloth-lined pants from Chen Zuqian, Tonglihao, Ding Baozhao, Nie Zhuojie, Li Bitang, Liu Jianwen, Chen Zhenfu, Lin Changxie, Chen Dehua, Wanguoan, Cheng Binghui, Ye Huifu, Bi Zhongen, Fuping Jiji, Yang Wenfang, Cen Zhongjie, Chen Shihe, Wu Yunan, Huang Ruiping, Wu Bing, Zhuang Weilin, Huang Jiutian, Zheng Shenquan, and other gentlemen and Liu Chenshi and Deng Yuexian and other ladies (to be continued). They have now sent 67 silk wadded vests and 37 lined cloth pants, entrusted to be sent to the front for use. The remaining items will be sent later when they are made. Their enthusiasm is commendable. The Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Shop is a giant in the Chinese medicine industry with many branches. Now, the colleagues of the shop have donated 245 yuan in consolation money. Because there are too many people, I don't have time to list them one by one, so I will briefly record them as follows: Mr. Xu Zhizheng 100 yuan, Mr. Cen Zhiliang 20 yuan, Mr. Xu Guizhen 10 yuan, Mr. Xu Zhifu 10 yuan, Mr. Cen Zongjiao 10 yuan, Mr. Xu Jiusong 10 yuan, Mr. Hu Wangshan 10 yuan, Mr. Hu Shigao and Cen Maochang 5 yuan each, Qiu Dasan and other 13 people 2 yuan each, Wang Linzhao and other 39 people 1 yuan each.

The above items were sent to the 19th Route Army Office. Yang Jidetang also donated 100 yuan, which was not recorded yesterday.</p>

<p>Related to the Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Released Twenty People the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>But There Were Several More Arrests The Lin Daily reported that according to reports, the Japanese Marines sent five people to the Hongkou Police Station yesterday (19th). They were related to the arrests made last week. After investigation, there was no evidence of their suspected crimes. The police station interrogated them and released them. It was also heard that yesterday morning (19th), three Japanese Marines sent fifteen Chinese people to the Sichuan Road Bridge and released them. One of them was a coolie who claimed to have been detained in a Japanese elementary school for ten days. Although the Japanese released more than a dozen people, yesterday afternoon a Western woman reported to the police station that she had seen several Japanese Marines arrest two Guangdong teenagers and search their bodies. Although they found nothing, they still took them to the Japanese Telegraph Bureau.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Has Many Tricks</h3>
<p>Sowing Discord, Inciting People's Hearts</p>
<p>The Japanese army attempted to occupy Shanghai but was heroically resisted by our army and repeatedly defeated. Since Commander Ueteda came to Shanghai to command, he has used various tricks to sow discord. Yesterday morning, three Japanese planes scattered hard paper leaflets over the Shen Garden area. The leaflets were printed with "A Message to Chinese Compatriots" and signed by the Headquarters of the Greater Japanese Empire. The wording was not only poorly written but also contained many instances of sowing discord and inciting people's hearts. I hope our people will not fall for the Japanese army's tricks.</p>
<h3>Yangxing Executes a Traitor</h3>
<p>Shen Xiaolaizi Yesterday afternoon, at the Yangxing bus station, a man from Jiangbei named Shen Xiaolaizi, who used to work in a Japanese yarn factory, was being unemployed and was paid 20 yen a day by the Japanese to act as a spy to scout our army's movements. When he came, he pretended to be a hawker selling rice flower candy, shouting along the way, and went deep into the Dachang Yangxing area. Yesterday, after the soldiers there discovered his tracks, they arrested him. As a result, two hidden badges and hand grenades were found on his body. After the military commander in charge of the area interrogated him, he was executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Yesterday Returned Home in Disarray</h3>
<p>Japanese residents living along the Hongkou area, protected by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, have been boarding ships to return to their country since the outbreak of hostilities. Except for Japanese ruffians who joined the plainclothes teams, the remaining women and children were among those returning to their country. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, over 150 Japanese residents, mostly women and children, were escorted by four members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Council. They were divided into two white canvas-covered trucks, departing from North Sichuan Road, passing through Nanjing Road eastward, and heading towards the Huangpu River to board Japanese warships for their return home.</p>
<h3>Relief Work</h3>
<p>The War Zone Relief Association Convenes a Meeting of Provincial Associations. The Shanghai War Zone Refugee Relief Association, in light of a Reuters dispatch in the "Important Telegrams" section of the Shen Bao on the 17th, under the headline "Beijing Prepares Refugee Camps," which described the exorbitant demands of tea attendants on passengers, found the situation appalling. Yesterday, the association clipped and pasted the newspaper report and sent a letter to Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire Steamship Companies, urging them to have compassion for the refugees, strictly order tea attendants and sailors to treat passengers with respect, and prevent any further extortion. Furthermore, the association held its second executive meeting yesterday afternoon. In addition to reports from various groups on the progress of their work, the association convened a meeting of various provincial associations yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to separately relieve refugees from different provinces, to coordinate efforts and avoid any being left out. The association's rescue team rescued 256 refugees on the 19th. Except for 13 who went to Hangzhou, the remainder were sent to various shelters. A total of 392 people have departed from the various shelters to other locations.</p>
<p>The Establishment of the Red Cross 22nd Hospital. The Chinese Red Cross 22nd Rear Hospital was established by the 10th Frontline Rescue Team of the said association. The hospital is located at the St. Louis Primary School of the Catholic Church on Tiantong'an Road in the French Concession outside the New North Gate. Besides the generous offer of the entire building free of charge by Father Neng, the director of the church, and Principal Yu Xiangong, they also donated equipment. The hospital is divided into the First and Second Hospitals. The First Hospital houses soldiers and civilians with minor injuries, and the Second Hospital houses soldiers and civilians with severe injuries. The two hospitals have more than 300 beds in total, and the operating rooms and various emergency treatment facilities are complete. It was officially established and started working the day before yesterday (the 19th). The president is Dr. Zhuang De, a famous local doctor. The director of medical affairs is Zhang Zhenyan, and the director of surgery is Wu Chongrui. The serving doctors include Gong Hanmei, Ai Renlin, Zhou Jiji, Li (blank), Wang Hongyun, Zhou Shenglai, Wang Zun, Xu Changhe, Zhuang Zhenmeng, Zhu Rongwang, and over 20 other well-known local doctors. The internal divisions, including finance, general affairs, medical affairs, documentation, and (blank), are also very complete. The start-up funds have already been generously contributed by the initiators and various officials, including Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Jin Tingxun, Lu Bohong, (blank) Shouren, and Shang Xinmai. Fearing that the operation period might be prolonged and regular funding insufficient, we earnestly appeal to all compassionate people to generously donate. Please send donations directly to the Red Cross 22nd Hospital for forwarding to the headquarters, which will issue receipts and publish them in various newspapers to express our gratitude.</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang Fellow-Countrymen's Association's Concern for Refugees. The board of directors of the Zhenjiang Five-County Sojourners in Shanghai Association and the Jingjiang Guild Hall held a joint meeting yesterday to discuss ways to relieve war zone refugees. It was decided to solicit donations from fellow-countrymen in Shanghai to support the various shelters in the concessions, so that the refugees could stay in this city or be provided with funds to return to their hometowns. The attending directors pledged a total of 6,500 yuan. In addition to sending circulars to fellow-countrymen in Shanghai and (blank) various newspapers, requesting donations according to their means, the Guild Hall and the Fellow-Countrymen's Association each donated 500 yuan to comfort the soldiers at the front.

In the afternoon, the first group of more than ten rescue team members departed for Zhongxing Road. At that time, the sound of artillery was loud, and three planes flew in the sky, dropping bombs, causing smoke to rise everywhere.

<p>Important Domestic and Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>League of Nations Decides to Convene a Special Assembly</h3>
<p>｜Setting March 3rd as the Assembly's Opening Date｜</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing Vehemently Denounces Japanese Army's Atrocities in Shanghai  　　 Sato Argues Forcefully, Audience Voices Discontent 　　 Chairman Paul-Boncour States Ceasefire Must Originate from Japanese Side 　　 British, Italian, French, and Spanish Representatives All Urge Japan to Compromise (Geneva) 　　 The Council today discussed China's request to convene an Assembly to address the current situation, especially the Shanghai Incident. It expressed great attention, and people gathered intently to listen to the arguments between the Chinese representative, Yan Huiqing, and the Japanese representative, Sato. The outcome of this meeting was the decision to hold a special session of the Assembly on March 3rd. Chairman Paul-Boncour stated at the opening of the meeting that today's session was to discuss China's application to convene a special meeting of the League of Nations. Since the Chinese representative had requested to express his grave concerns regarding the Shanghai situation, he suggested that the Executive Council should first allow Dr. Yan to address the audience. Dr. Yan then addressed the assembly in silence, stating that he had submitted various telegrams to the Executive Council, detailing the various atrocities committed by the Japanese army in the undeclared state of war, and reporting that the number of Japanese troops in Shanghai exceeded 40,000, the number of warships in the river was as high as 40, the Japanese army's use of dumdum bullets had created a terrifying situation in Shanghai, and that they continued to use the Public Concession as a base of operations. Dr. Yan vehemently denounced the slanderous remarks made by the Japanese side against the brave 19th Route Army defending Shanghai, and stated that the negotiations initiated by the British Minister to China, Sir Miles Lampson, between the Chinese and Japanese commanders had been ineffective, and that Japan had now issued an ultimatum expiring on Saturday, with a major war imminent, involving 100,000 troops in combat. This situation could not be ignored, so he requested the Executive Council to consider and implement protective measures to stop the Japanese military offensive. The Japanese army itself was not making an equivalent withdrawal, but was forcibly demanding that the Chinese troops withdraw 20 kilometers within their own territory. What was their purpose? The Chinese commander had stated that the troops under his command were obeying orders and resisting aggression. A few days ago, the Executive Council had sent a letter to Japan, asking them to act with restraint. Japan bears immeasurable responsibility before world opinion. What was Japan's response? Attack, ultimatum, and continuous aggression, and so on. Chairman Paul-Boncour then asked the Japanese representative, Sato, to respond. Sato first read out a document concerning the dropping of bombs by Japanese aircraft in the Public Concession, resulting in loss of life, and the British protest against this, stating that this was an unfortunate and occasional incident, and that the Japanese had apologized to the British authorities for this. Sato continued to address the protest lodged by Simpson regarding the Japanese bombing of a refugee camp, saying that the refugee camp was surrounded by barbed wire obstacles, and the aircraft mistakenly thought it was a military target, which was regrettable. Sato continued, saying that Japan must formally protest against some of the points made by Dr. Yan. The claim that the Japanese army used dumdum bullets and poison gas was untrue. The Japanese army had never used this bullet, even in the Russo-Japanese War. This was impossible. If the Chinese representative could provide evidence that the Japanese army had used smoke bombs, but not poison gas. Dr. Yan accused the Japanese army of being aggressors and constantly launching attacks first. Japan also had reservations about this. The Japanese army was forced to use force to defend itself. The Japanese army never wanted to attack unless it was unavoidable. As for the accusations against the 19th Route Army, the Japanese side had obtained local intelligence confirming this. Dr. Yan's request to the Executive Council to find a way to stop the hostilities. In fact, Japan has done its best to stop the hostilities and hopes to obtain a ceasefire solution. But this effort was in vain. I will explain why the Japanese army was forced into its current position, but I must first explain the origins of the current situation. Chairman Paul-Boncour has declared that the Executive Council, at China's request, wishes to refer the study of this issue to the Assembly. I do not know the content of this resolution, but I feel that the Executive Council is about to hand this matter over to the Assembly, so this is my last opportunity to speak to the Executive Council. I will continue to explain so that the Assembly can understand the various facts of this case. What I am talking about now is the origin of this problem. All the disasters and sufferings we have suffered in the Far East originate from China, not the fact that these countries are organized nations. The country we have to deal with is a country where civil wars are incessant and the rule of law is non-existent. This is painful to say, but unfortunately, it is the truth. If we were dealing with a civilized country, our entire approach would be different, and we could resort to public arbitration or any other method to seek a solution. Thirteen years ago, when China joined the League of Nations, China was an organized nation, but since joining the League of Nations, China has disintegrated. Internal unrest broke out, warlords fought each other, and foreigners could not be protected. Therefore, other countries were also forced to adopt methods that were not applied to civilized countries. Today, if we criticize acts of aggression, we must criticize other countries for their similar acts towards China. The Executive Council must express how it criticizes the same acts committed before Japan. Other countries feel that this kind of behavior is the only way because the League of Nations cannot apply its charter to its various relations with China. Our only purpose is to protect our interests. If we withdraw our troops from Shanghai, it means giving up all our rights in China. This is something that no government can do. Sato, having said this, cited the figures for Shanghai's import and export trade to show that Japan occupies the third position in this trade. He then said that since the League of Nations could not find a way to assist us in our legitimate interests, we only had to protect ourselves. (The audience voiced discontent, and the chairman struck the table with his gavel to stop it). The Executive Council should know how to seek the most adequate and effective solutions in accordance with the truth of the situation. Regarding the League of Nations' application to Japan, I have not yet received a reply from the government. Sato continued to speak about the independence of Manchuria, stating that this matter had to be mentioned because he would no longer have the opportunity to speak before the Assembly convened to discuss this matter. He first explained the term "independent state," explaining the different understandings of the term. The term "independence" is equivalent to self-reliance. Manchuria's current status is a form of autonomy. Japan supports this movement and sympathizes with it. Japan has suffered a lot in Manchuria and feels that this movement can solve its difficulties and allow Japan to live peacefully and develop its interests. Japan cannot accept any political situation that could endanger its capital in Manchuria. When Central China is reorganized, Manchuria may be able to re-establish relations with China, but this is a question for the future. When the Japanese side agreed to the League of Nations resolution of September 30, the Japanese side originally intended to withdraw its troops to the agreed area, but the situation developed rapidly, unexpectedly and unusually, so the situation has now changed greatly. Sato continued to mention the boycott of Japanese goods, the suffering of the Japanese people due to overpopulation, and the difficulty for the Japanese to move elsewhere after the Americas and Africa banned foreigners from entering the country. He said that Japan had sought great improvements in the League of Nations thirteen years ago, but ultimately felt that it was being treated with closed doors everywhere. The Japanese are now being driven out of China, and trade is also being destroyed. We have no territorial ambitions in Manchuria. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan could have annexed Manchuria, but it still returned it to China, not because China was a secret ally of Russia, and refused to return it. What we want is a free garden where Japanese people who respect the principle of open doors can have peace and good administration, and anyone can jointly develop a vast and rich land. We cannot give up Manchuria. This is a matter of life and death for Japan. Has the League of Nations protested against the disappearance of Outer Mongolia from the map of China? However, Outer Mongolia has completely disappeared. We have declared that we have no territorial ambitions. Before the League of Nations blames Japan for its actions in Manchuria, it must investigate the Outer Mongolia incident. As for Shanghai, we only have the idea of self-defense. After our interests are guaranteed, we are ready to withdraw and let neutral troops protect our interests. Dr. Yan replied that the Japanese army's ultimatum would expire in just a few hours. Sato spent a lot of time giving this long speech. The reason for this is clear, but he had to refute the insulting remarks made by the Japanese representative. The Japanese representative referred to China as a chaotic and lawless country. This was a slanderous remark. Sato spoke of an organized government. Can a country where the army and navy can act recklessly be called an organized government? The Soviet Union seized Outer Mongolia before the establishment of the League of Nations. It is absurd to say that the League of Nations can handle this matter now. The Japanese representative, on the one hand, claimed that China has no government and is not an organized country, and on the other hand, advocated direct negotiations with an unorganized country, and did not want to hand this issue over to the League of Nations. This attitude is self-contradictory. Most of the civil wars in China are due to Japanese conspiracies. Japan often subsidizes Party A to attack Party B. The world can see the difference between Japan's goals and those of other countries. Other countries' goals are to protect China, while Japan has always been engaged in inciting unrest. It should be known that China has never been as united as it is today. The commanders who had previously quarreled with each other are now gathered in one room to jointly defend the country. What kind of protection has Japan requested from the League of Nations? Japan is now occupying 200,000 square miles of Chinese territory, bombing Shanghai and Nanjing, and saying that it is asking the League of Nations for protection. This is simply a joke. Dr. Yan then asked the Executive Council to do what it should do, saying that a major bloodbath would begin in four hours. We ask the Executive Council to make an immediate decision. Japan has declared that it has no territorial ambitions, but we have heard this before when Korea was not yet part of the Japanese Empire. Sato denied that the Japanese had incited unrest in China, saying that Japan only wanted peace and order. The claim that Japan was inciting unrest was not credible. Chairman Paul-Boncour, with his fluent eloquence, asked Sato to postpone the deadline of the ultimatum so that there would be room for a solution, and said that he had decided to convene the Assembly, but he did not ignore the Japanese representative's words. When the Executive Council sent the application to Japan, it knew the great strength of the Japanese army and navy, but also knew that the ceasefire had to come from the Japanese side because the Japanese army was on Chinese soil. We only applied to Japan because Japan is a strong country, and from various points of view, Japan is a great country. We now have the threat of a major war. We have not forgotten the Japanese representative's declaration regarding Article 10 of the Covenant. If Japan does not want to retreat from the major war arena, does it not conflict with its declaration? The Japanese representative claimed that he was prepared to hand over the area to neutral troops, which was a suggestion, so he urgently advocated postponing the deadline of the ultimatum. The British representative, Lord Londonderry, supported Paul-Boncour's remarks, saying that the dangerous situation was developing, and its seriousness was indescribable. What is now being requested from Japan is neither a public prosecution nor a judgment. He strongly supported the request to postpone the ultimatum to prevent a tragedy. We have not lost hope that the United Kingdom and others can promote successful peace talks. The representatives of Italy, Germany, and Spain all spoke in favor of postponing the deadline of the ultimatum. The Spanish representative also asked, where is world peace going? Where is the Covenant of the League of Nations going? Sato replied that one thing was possible: the ceasefire must be done by both sides. The Executive Council should use the same strength to request the same from the people fighting against the Japanese army. Paul-Boncour then said that he hoped Sato would send an urgent telegram as quickly as possible. The reason why the Executive Council first requested Japan was because the ultimatum came from Japan, so postponing its deadline also depended on Japan. But if the ultimatum could be put aside, he was prepared to request both countries with the same strength and the same pressure.</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>Paul-Boncour asked the government with representatives in Shanghai to issue an application hoping to shelve the ultimatum. Paul-Boncour then announced the Executive Council's resolution, the main points of which were that although the Executive Council had resolved to submit this issue to the Assembly, it would continue to maintain its work for peace.</p>
<p>The Executive Council finally passed the following resolution: ㈠ The Executive Council, in considering the application submitted by the Chinese representative invoking the provisions of Article 15, paragraph 9, of the League of Nations Covenant, stating that the Sino-Japanese case should be transferred to the League of Nations Assembly, hereby resolves to transfer the case to the Assembly in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 9, of the Covenant. ㈡ Since almost all member states of the League of Nations have delegations gathered in Geneva to participate in the Conference on Limitation and Reduction of Armaments, the Assembly may be convened within a short period of time. The Executive Council hereby resolves that March 3 shall be the date of the Assembly's opening. ㈢ The Executive Council, after recording the methods it has taken to obtain the information necessary for considering the dispute, hereby requests the two parties concerned to make every effort to submit to the Secretary-General all descriptions regarding the case, together with all relevant facts and documents stipulated in Article 15, paragraph 2, of the Covenant, for use by the Assembly. ㈣ The Executive Council's responsibility to continue its work to maintain peace in accordance with the Covenant shall not be affected by this resolution.</p>
<p>This meeting of the Executive Council was the longest and most moving meeting. Even Sato, who was calm and composed, seemed to feel something and was no longer as calm as usual. However, when he responded to Chairman Paul-Boncour's request, he clearly revealed a sense of great responsibility. Dr. Yan looked haggard, eager to record, but did not want to reply. Paul-Boncour said that tonight in Geneva was an anxious night, just like in Shanghai. The representatives in the venue constantly watched the clock, feeling that time was passing quickly, and the closer the time of the tragedy was, the more they unanimously supported Paul-Boncour's request. Sato later spoke to the Executive Council, saying that the chairman's request had been supported by other representatives. He heard this request and could not help but be moved, deeply aware of the anxiety of the people of various countries in the Far East. He expressed regret for the situation that caused the anxiety of various countries and understood the desire for peace of the gentlemen present. If peace could be maintained under this situation, he would gladly welcome the mediation of the great powers. For the sake of the Far East, he would convey your requests to his government. What he regretted was that a similarly urgent request had not been sent to China. We are in a miserable position in Shanghai. If we withdraw, it is tantamount to Japan giving up the position it has acquired with great effort. If the Executive Council advises complete withdrawal, then I will not be able to convey this request to my government. (Reuter's dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Will Take Active Action</h3>
<p>British Cabinet Forms Special Committee on Shanghai Incident 　　 Naval Reservists Have Been Ordered to Prepare 　　 Americans Advocate Cooperation with the League of Nations</p>
<h3>London This morning, Londoners saw the headline</h3>
<p>of various newspapers on their breakfast tables saying "The Great War in Shanghai Has Begun." They were all shocked. The War Office was lit up all night, the first time since the European War. All departments are now unusually active. The Cabinet has formed a special Shanghai Committee, ready to be summoned by the Prime Minister's residence at any time. Its members are Conservative Party leader Baldwin, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, Foreign Secretary Simon, Colonial Secretary Thomas, and Secretary of State for India Hoare. Everyone tacitly acknowledges that the time for diplomatic documents has passed, and what follows will contain a real action. According to Brisbane news, the Australian Navy has been placed on short leave, and several levels of naval reservists have been warned by the authorities to prepare for unforeseen events in the Far East at any time. According to Washington news, former Secretary of War Baker and Harvard University President Lowell and other celebrities wrote to President Hoover, advocating that the United States should indicate that if the League of Nations takes any economic plans to restore peace, it is willing to cooperate with the League of Nations, and said that the United States, in accordance with the Kellogg-Briand Pact, has a duty to come forward to intervene. According to Boston's Fu Lai news, Professor Haas of Harvard Graduate School of Engineering is now launching a boycott of Japanese goods. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>US Authorities Recognize Shanghai Situation is Very Tricky</h3>
<p>Our Country Asks the United States to Take Effective Measures 　　 Stimson Meets with Hoover to Discuss Solutions 　　 (Washington) US Secretary of State Stimson believes that the Shanghai situation created by Japan's ultimatum is very tricky. When he met with reporters today, he refused to comment. The Chinese legation here has formally delivered a note from the Chinese government to the US government, requesting the United States to take steps to maintain peace in Shanghai, and declaring that the Chinese government cannot accept the Japanese army's demands to the local authorities and the commander of the 19th Route Army, because they are too harsh and unreasonable. Therefore, the relevant personnel of the State Department are now considering whether or not to take any steps. There is no clear answer yet. Some people advocate issuing a public statement to respond to China's request, which can stimulate world public opinion in support of peace. However, the general opinion is that given the rapid changes in the Shanghai situation, no one believes that any action taken by the United States can have an immediate effect sufficient to stop Japan's military actions. Also, it is a national electrical dispatch. 　　 Two 　　 (Washington) Political circles have not yet abandoned hope that the Sino-Japanese dispute can be resolved without major loss of life. Secretary of State Stimson today again presented President Hoover with a detailed report on the Shanghai situation, after which the two discussed it for a long time. State Department officials were greatly disappointed by the ineffectiveness of the Shanghai peace talks. They are now actively considering how to deal with the situation that will arise from the continued war. The news of the convening of the League of Nations Assembly was received with great attention here. However, the opinion in political circles is that the actions of the League of Nations cannot change Japan's decision that the Shanghai and Manchurian cases must be negotiated directly with China. (Reuter's dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Convenes Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Considering Whether to Send More Reinforcements to Shanghai</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Preparations are now underway to hold an emergency cabinet meeting tomorrow if necessary. Whether or not it will be held will depend on the development of the Shanghai situation. The purpose of this meeting is probably to consider whether to send additional reinforcements to Shanghai. In order to eliminate misunderstandings, the Japanese government has ordered Sato, the Japanese representative in Geneva, to explain to various countries that the ultimatum issued by the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Shanghai was not addressed to the Chinese government, but only concerned the 19th Route Army. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges Strong Protest with Japanese Ambassador</h3>
<p>Regarding Ueda's Ultimatum 　　　　 Considered Extremely Unreasonable 　　 (Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese ambassador regarding the final ultimatum from Japanese Commander Ueda. The original text is as follows: According to a telegram from Shanghai Army Commander Cai Tingkai, at 8:45 pm on the 18th, he received a letter from Japanese Army Commander Ueda Kenkichi, requesting the Chinese army to promptly cease combat operations and complete the withdrawal of the current front line before 7:00 am on the 20th, and to withdraw completely from the designated areas on the east and west banks of the Huangpu River, 20 kilometers from the Concession line, before 5:00 pm on the same day. In addition, the fortifications and other military facilities in the withdrawal area must be removed and no new ones built, and other terms are listed for implementation. Otherwise, it will take free action, etc. According to a telegram from Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Murai Kuramatsu also sent a similar official letter to the mayor. Since September 18 of last year, when the Japanese army provoked trouble in Shenyang without any reason, it has been advancing with force and occupying various places in the Northeast. On January 28 of this year, the Japanese army suddenly attacked Zhabei in Shanghai. For two decades, large units of the Japanese army, navy, and air force have arbitrarily attacked various places in Zhabei and Wusong. The Chinese garrison had to resist for self-defense. However, the commander and consul-general of your country's army in Shanghai have even made various impossible demands to Army Commander Cai and Mayor Wu, which is extremely unreasonable. If the Japanese army attacks again, the Chinese army will still do its best to resist. Your government should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom. Correspondingly, a strong protest is made, and the ambassador is requested to investigate. (Special telegram from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and Others Discuss Shanghai Situation in Nanjing</h3>
<p>All-Day Meeting Yesterday 　　　　 Results Not Yet Released 　　 (Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Luo Wengan, He Yingqin, etc. met here all day today to discuss the Shanghai situation. Zhang Jingjiang and Wu Zhihui came here from Shanghai this morning to join the discussion. This meeting is extremely important, but the decisions made have not yet been released. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Chiang Kai-shek went to Shanghai to inspect the battlefield, he returned to Nanjing yesterday afternoon and immediately consulted with Wang Jingwei, Luo Wengan, and other government officials on the current situation. Afterwards, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a declaration stating that it could not accept the Japanese demands. (National Electrical Dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Wu Zhihui and Zeng Yangfu arrived in Nanjing from Hangzhou on the 20th and stayed at the guest house of the Construction Committee. Zeng told reporters that the violence of the Japanese invasion is becoming more and more urgent, and we only have to be determined to resist to the end in order to achieve final victory. The recent report that I encountered bandits on the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway is not true. (Special telegram from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Circular Telegram Narrates the Course of the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>If Japan Has Sincerity to Show 　　　　 Our Government is Willing to Consider it Carefully 　　 (Nanjing) Wang Jingwei sent a telegram on the 20th to the provincial and municipal governments and various groups. The original telegram was over 1,000 words long. The first paragraph described the Japanese ultimatum, and the second paragraph described the course of the Shanghai incident. Regarding this attitude and action of Japan, we cannot but recognize that Japan has no sincerity for peace. Japan used the pretext of protecting its nationals, with the 3rd Division and continuing to increase its troops, more than 40 warships, 3 aircraft carriers, more than 100 aircraft, and countless field guns and heavy artillery, damaging the lives, land, property, and property of our people. China explained to the ambassadors of the three countries of Great Britain, the United States, and France that it originally hoped to withdraw its troops at the same time, so that the goodwill of friendly countries would not be in vain. However, Japan issued an ultimatum to us again. The Chinese army is determined to defend itself. If Japan can indeed stop attacking, our army will never counterattack. The troop withdrawal areas referred to in the ultimatum are all our own territory. Our garrison has no reason to withdraw. Japanese nationals have always been protected by China. As for the claim that the protection seems to be incomplete, Japan may take appropriate measures, as if it wants to find an excuse to stir up trouble. Regarding the so-called cessation of the anti-Japanese movement, at a time when the Japanese army is invading our country, if Japan does not withdraw its troops and show respect for China's territorial sovereignty and integrity, then the anti-Japanese movement cannot be eliminated. In short, all responsibility and losses should be borne by Japan. Based on the above reasons, the various items mentioned in the Japanese letter cannot be accepted. If the Japanese government clearly orders the Japanese army to stop the invasion immediately and expresses further sincerity, the Chinese government is willing to consider it in good faith. The last paragraph also stated that ㈠ our country loves peace, ㈡ if the Japanese army invades again, China will resolutely resist, and ㈢ the Shanghai incident is not just a corner. To defend Shanghai, we must help each other, and the whole country should make a long-term struggle with the greatest determination. (Special telegram from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Rarely Comments on Manchuria-Mongolia Independence Declaration</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian newspapers are generally controlled by the government. Today, they published the Manchuria-Mongolia Republic declaration issued by the puppet government of the three northeastern provinces, without commenting on it. Soviet Russian officials also strongly rejected commenting on this matter. However, Russian newspapers have reprinted editorials from German and American newspapers, but they have been very careful to conceal their own views and are unwilling to reveal their views lightly. However, it is reported that Russian officials are very concerned about the announcement of the three northeastern provinces, especially because the puppet government of the three northeastern provinces has made a clear statement against the Soviet system, but this situation has never been recorded in newspapers.

<h3>Painlevé's Attempt to Form a New Cabinet Fails</h3>
<p>Radical Party Refuses to Cooperate 　　　　 Tardieu Will Replace Him 　　 (Paris) After the Laval cabinet resigned, President Doumer immediately entrusted former Prime Minister Painlevé to reorganize a new cabinet. Painlevé originally planned to organize a coalition cabinet, but the Radical Socialist Party was unwilling to cooperate with him. Also, Painlevé intended to recruit representatives from various parties, but those representatives were not necessarily allowed to participate by their own parties. Painlevé encountered difficulties in distributing ministries, especially after the negotiations with Tardieu broke down. Therefore, he had to give up the idea of forming a cabinet. Painlevé recently went to the Presidential Palace to declare to President Doumer that he had declined. The President immediately consulted separately to find a suitable person.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Intensifies National Defense Preparations</h3>
<p>Precautions After Japanese Warships Reappear Interference by Japanese Consul in Guangdong Reports Guangdong Correspondence: The Japanese military, recently suffering setbacks at the hands of the 19th Route Army in Shanghai, is considering threats elsewhere. The southern coastal ports, with Xiamen at the forefront, are the most vulnerable. Therefore, Japanese warships have recently been dispatched to Xiamen again to contain the Southwest's support for Shanghai. It is reported that since the resolution of the Shantou newspaper incident, coinciding with the height of the Shanghai war, the Japanese side suddenly dispatched the warship "Nashi" to Shantou on the 10th of this month, entering the port without permission. The Shantou authorities, in addition to the mayor protesting to the Japanese consul in Shantou, also intensified military deployments. The Independent 2nd Division, led by Zhang Ruigui, reinforced defenses, stacking sandbags at various intersections along the coast and deploying armed soldiers to guard them day and night. They also instructed the Chao-Shantou Customs to extinguish the lights of the three lighthouses near Shantou port – Zhuzhou, Biaojiao, and Mayu – every night at 12:00 to prevent enemy warships from invading. These three lighthouses are located on the main sea lanes from Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Southeast Asia into Shantou port. Extinguishing the lights at night greatly hinders navigation, as the surrounding reefs and sandbars pose a natural hazard. At the same time, the Shantou authorities, to guard against enemy aircraft, have dispatched large units of soldiers to guard the lighthouses and set up anti-aircraft guns to shoot down enemy planes. The Third Army Commander, Li Yangjing, in order to strengthen coastal defense, has transferred the entire Division □ under his command to Shantou, stationed in the city to protect the people. Seeing the tense situation, the Japanese consul stationed in Shantou transferred the Japanese warship "Take" previously stationed in Shantou harbor on the 12th to ease tensions. In fact, the Japanese still have the more powerful warship "Nashi," which has not yet left. The warship "Nashi" has a very large carrying capacity. According to the Japanese consul, the ship is only transporting grain to Shantou. However, according to general speculation, the ship carries more than just grain. Nevertheless, the Shantou defense forces are fully prepared to defend our territory. As for the Guangzhou authorities, believing that the enemy has no credibility, have completed all water and land defense works and equipment within the month as a precautionary measure. Water plants and power plants have also automatically arranged defensive works. Stronger troops have been deployed to guard the Henan area, and the regiments of Division □ stationed in the Dongjiang Heyuan area have been withdrawn to the province, stationed in the suburbs of the provincial capital. Li Jiezhi, the former Independent Brigade Commander, has been newly appointed as the Commander of the Humen Fortress, specializing in the important task of coastal defense. The remaining naval, land, and air force matters are also subject to a comprehensive plan, but due to military secrecy, they cannot be disclosed. The Japanese Consul in Guangzhou, Suma, recently protested to the municipal government under the pretext of Guangdong newspaper reports, stating that he had been reading the newspapers and repeatedly seeing exaggerated reports of the war between Chinese troops and his country's troops in Shanghai. He said that such actions could easily lead to international disputes and requested that the mayor of the city instruct the newspapers not to publish such news in the future. After receiving this letter, Guangzhou Mayor Cheng Tiangu firmly refuted it, stating that domestic newspapers have the right to freedom of speech, and that the news of the Shanghai war was based on telegrams from Shanghai. He also stated that he has no other way to know the exact number of his country's troops, planes, and warships killed, shot down, and sunk by his country's troops, which may be more than the number published in the local newspapers. The Mayor also stated that the local newspapers have a duty to report everything they hear, and that they should do their best to report the news of his country's navy and marines unreasonably attacking his country's territory and indiscriminately killing and burning within his country's territory so that the people of his country may know of his country's troops' bravery. However, he stated that he often sees large-font headlines in his country's newspapers reporting on the killing of his country's troops, the burning of his country's territory, and the unreasonable news of the attack on Shanghai, and he has not heard of his country's consul submitting a protest to his country's government. He asked the consul if he does not read the newspapers. (February 15th)</p>
<h3>Shanxi and Sui Prepare to Send Troops</h3>
<p>Each Army Decides to Select Elite Troops Five Divisions Armories Rush to Manufacture Hand Grenades Taiyuan Correspondence: Generals from all sides have recently been vying to volunteer to resist Japan, and the armies of Shanxi and Sui are not lagging behind. The central government believes that the armies of Shanxi and Sui are known for their proficiency with hand grenades, and that the recent fighting between the anti-Japanese forces and the Japanese army has mostly been street fighting. If the hand grenades of the armies of Shanxi and Sui are fully utilized, it will surely achieve quick results. Therefore, there is an order to select five divisions from the armies of Shanxi and Sui to move out and resist Japan. After receiving the telegram, the generals of Shanxi and Sui are actively preparing so that they can depart as soon as possible. Also, because the armories have long been shut down, after the troops depart, the supply of hand grenades must be fully ensured. In addition to the large amount currently in stock, it has been decided to immediately restore operations at the hand grenade factory under the armories and work overtime to rush the manufacture. The other gun, cannon, and bullet factories are also preparing to restore full operations. Regarding the various issues concerning the departure of the troops, the generals have been asking Yan for instructions in the past few days. After Yang Aiyuan and Zhao Pilian, whom Yan sent to Luoyang, return to the city with the central government's plan, each army will follow orders and depart in batches, led by Xu Yongchang out of the province. As for the issue of the organization of this anti-Japanese force, it is said that a mixed system will be adopted, that is, a certain number of elite and strong officers and soldiers will be selected from each division, mixed, and formed into five divisions, and it is scheduled to hold a mobilization ceremony in the near future. The oath for this ceremony is said to be currently being drafted by Yan Xishan. (February 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Bin County Provincial Government Again</h3>
<p>Official Li Prepares to Resist Japan Again A Glimpse of the Ugly Behavior of Han Traitors in Harbin Harbin Correspondence: Xi Qia, on the 9th of this month, instigated two Japanese planes to fly to Bin County to scatter leaflets, advising Chairman Ji to sincerely agree to cancel the provincial government within three days and hand over political power. Since Jun Hongzhan's regiment of troops happened to arrive in the county on that day, the Japanese planes dropped seven bombs, killing more than a dozen soldiers. Subsequently, another plane flew to the jurisdiction of the Public Security Bureau and dropped three bombs, destroying the bureau. The entire city was in chaos. At noon on the 10th, a Japanese plane still went to scout and scatter surrender leaflets. Cheng Yun sincerely refused to budge. The Japanese military, because the situation in Jinxi is pressing, is unable to attack Bin County. The Hamanoto infantry regiment of the Domoto division and two tanks were transported to Ning'an on the days before yesterday, so the Bin County provincial government is temporarily at peace. Xi Qia plans to make arrangements in Harbin and will still send his rebel troops to harass, so war will be difficult to avoid in the end. It is confirmed that Ding Chao's troops have arrived in Hulan after their defeat and will probably transfer to Binzhou to join forces with Feng's regiment. Gong Zhanhai's troops are heading towards the Hengdaohezi and Yimianpo mountains. Xi Qia has sent personnel to appease them, but Gong has refused. Li Du returned to Yilan on the 12th and is actively replenishing. In the near future, they will inevitably fight the Japanese side again, so the Japanese side is now forcing Zhang Jinghui to lobby Li. The results are still unknown. Xi Qia also fears that Li and Ding will rise again, and has specially ordered Guo Enlin, the director of his Military and Political Department, to come to Harbin to handle the surrender of the Self-Defense Army. Song Wenjun, a former brigade commander in the Self-Defense Army, and Bai Wenqing, the former regimental commander of the 28th Brigade, have already accepted Guo's recruitment. The cancellation of the Harbin Special Zone is Xi Qia's established plan. Zhang Yanqing, the fake Director of the Industrial Department, came to Harbin yesterday to contact Zhang Jinghui. The Northeast Navigation Bureau, the only important agency for river transportation with an annual income of over ten million, was originally under the direct jurisdiction of the Northeast Political Committee. Yesterday, Xi also telegraphed Li Guilin in Harbin to take over. In addition, Xi Qia sent people to take over all agencies where positions could be arranged and recommended, which is also part of the conspiracy to cancel the Harbin Special Zone.</p>
<p>During the time when Ding and Li were suppressing the rebellion and resisting Japan, all the records in the Harbin newspapers were naturally disliked by the traitors. Now that Tang Wu, Xi Qia's henchman and the Director of the Binjiang Public Security Bureau, has returned to office, all newspapers are prohibited from publishing. Of the more than ten Harbin daily newspapers, only two small newspapers and the lifeless Donghua Daily (run by Xue Dake) and the Harbin Gazette, which promotes Zhang Jinghui and the Japanese side, are currently being published. Besides these, there are several Russian newspapers, but the news they publish must be checked first. Therefore, there are no newspapers to read and no news to hear in Harbin. The radio station is controlled by the Japanese military communications team, which is euphemistically called Sino-Japanese cooperation, but in reality it is entirely occupied by the Japanese. Communications from various places and commercial telegrams must also be strictly checked by the Japanese before they are allowed to be released. However, the post office is not yet being checked, so newspapers from various places are still fortunately able to reach Harbin.</p>
<p>The leaders here are all afraid of death and have no integrity. They fawn over Japanese military generals and special service chiefs such as Doihara and Consul Ohashi, fearing they won't be good enough. A few days ago, Zhang Jinghui hosted a large banquet for the Japanese at the Eastern Railway Club. At the banquet, Zhang made flattering remarks to Japanese General Domoto, which were extremely disgusting. Domoto also gave a reply, which was utterly absurd. In addition, Bao Guancheng, the Mayor of the Special City, Fan Peizhong, the Director of the Telegraph Bureau, and the leaders of the two city chambers of commerce also hosted banquets for Japanese General Domoto and others, which is enough to show the ugly behavior of ordinary traitors. Since the 10th, Doihara, accompanied by personnel from the Governor-General's Office, has been checking the tax revenue and agencies such as banks and customs, and has assigned two or three Japanese advisors to each to monitor them. Bao Guancheng, the Mayor of the Special City, is Doihara's Chinese secretary. After Doihara arrived in Harbin, he requested this position. The Bureau is the only revenue-generating agency in the Special Zone. Doihara gave it to Bao, probably wanting to reenact the story of the Mayor of Shenyang, just appointing a proxy to avoid foreign attention. (12th)</p>
