<h3>歐洲對美之挑戰（下）彬</h3>
<p>美國就長此征服了歐洲嗎。換言之。資本主義的世界就能以凡爾賽和約或是道威斯計劃揚格計劃爲基礎而長此安定了嗎。當然。這是絶對的不能。由於無窮期的賠欵之榨壓。十幾年來。德國已呈水窮山盡之勢。到了血盡皮枯。榨取無方的時候德國唯一的出路。便只有呼籲修改和約。換言之。即減輕賠欵。或者是將賠欵一律勾銷這樣便使與賠欵息息相關的戰債基礎已開始動摇。次之。由於德國之凋敝。歐洲各國都呈江河日下之勢。同時由於生活之艱難。德國的社會思想日益左傾。更使歐洲各國感受嚴重的威脅資本主義列强都知道不解脫德國賠欵的束縛。德國的經濟終於無法改善。而左傾勢力之張大。或且因而爆發革命。終於是無可避免於是「賠欵與戰債一筆勾銷」的呼聲。幾年以來。不斷的從英國和意國的政治家口裏喊出。雖說。法國因爲時時防止德國之復興對於此一主張未能同意但戰債之基礎以此而愈益動摇。又爲無可諱言之事實。復次。自一九二九年下半期以來。世界經濟恐慌之狂潮。即以空前的力量震撼資本主義的統治。一般資本家與金融家都爲之手足無措。而認爲賠欵與戰債爲致使經濟恐慌之根因。於是而解决賠欵與戰債問題。以挽回資本主義的末刦。更爲一般短視的經濟學者所主張。緣起之故。美總統胡佛氏去年决然提出連環停付戰債賠欵一年之計劃以緩和國際間之空氣。一以予歐洲以喘息的機會。企辕以此挽回世界之繁榮一時遂博得聰明債主之好譽。然而一年過去了。德國之凋敝依然如故世界之凋敝亦依然如故。而且一切的矛盾更爲深刻擴大。於是乃又有洛桑會議之召集。同時無論美國怎樣表示不願與聞。怎樣表示賠欵與戰債不能併爲一談。但洛桑公約終於簽定了而且進步的成立四國紳士協定接着又成立了英法恊定。接着德意比都加入了這一恊定是明顯地以一致的步調。威脅美國放棄戰債。</p>
<p>美國對於這一挑戰的答復。是戰債可以減少。但歐洲必以減少軍備爲條件。他狠聰的將賠欵戰債與軍縮加以聯繫。所以在軍縮會議中。胡佛氏曾提出驚人的軍縮計劃。最近美參議員波拉主張召集世界會議。考慮改訂。或廢除戰債。但同時又一再聲明。如無軍縮條約等恊定以爲之輔則彼仍堅决反對戰債之取消。這一事實的意義。即是美國不願放棄戰債。使歐洲得有餘力擴張軍備。以便充分的準備第二次世界大戰。這就是暴露了資本主義國家相互間矛盾。</p>

<h3>九一八事變後之日本財政（續）</h3>
<p>東京通信　懐仁</p>
<p>公債大量的發行、在目前日本的財政上、確乎是一件欲避而不能避的癥結、雖說彌縫財政的缺陷、不僅限於發行公債之一途但在軍人聯合内閣之下、極不願實行立刻會有反響的增稅政策、其結果、自不能不走入於負債生活的一法誠然、目下日本人民是没有再堪忍受加稅的能力了、致府爲禮恤民艱起見、實行其募債的較上策、以緩和社會人心、然而這又是一件不可思議的矛盾、不能忍受增稅的人民、如何能應募這龐大額的公債呢、據大藏大臣說、這公債的大部分將由日本銀行應募、驟聞之、似乎公債的發行、已不復與人民有若何切膚的關係、但事實是没有這樣的簡單、</p>
<p>大部分公債由日銀承受的結果、必至增發通貨以作滿洲事件費、赤字塡補及失業事業之用、不消說將引起通貨澎漲的作用、其餘不由日銀承受的小部分公債、大槪都由大藏省預金部應募、預金部應募的結果、雖不至積極的澎漲通貨、但事實上預金部承受公債的時候、必然的將發其死藏着的貯蓄以週轉、實際上也有消極的促進通貨澎漲的可能、</p>
<p>通貨澎漲的結果、使通貨價格日趨於暴落、相對的物價必漸趨於騰貴、照景氣循環的原理、必然的可以喚起一時的產業投資、但在今日世界經濟危機四伏的時代、這是談何容易所以最近日本通貨澎漲物價騰貴的結果、不唯不能振起產業的熱度、感將使勞動者的實質工銀愈趨於低下、而金利生活者、小布　喬亞、農民之財產、無形中暗被徴發、終局使中間層急激的没落爲無產階級、形成有產與無產間明晰的鬥爭、而築造起日本未來的新局面、</p>
<p>九一信事變以後、倐怱經年、日本能否長治久安的盤踞於我東北三省、而行名實俱符的吞併滿蒙、則全視乎我國今後努力之程度及國際與論之態度以爲斷、但日本因九一八而受的財政裂痕與今後之恐怖、已經横放在我們的眼簾、這個或者可以使我們極度的悲哀後得到少許的安慰、然而决不容許我們即因此而樂觀、　　（完）</p>

<p>冠軍　日本會　一○五盤　七八　二七</p>
<p>亞軍　中華會　一○五盤　七六　二九</p>
<p>中華網球會之二次打擊</p>
<p>以實力與機會論之、本季中華網球會實居無上上乘、徒以缺少决心、致錦標失之交臂、南草地僅以八比七勝一分、而鄉下總會則又以七比八失敗二次打擊於是昨日雖具最後决心、已覺吃力、兹列二隊全部成績以賣參考、</p>
<p>中華會　日本會</p>
<p>勝北草地　十五比○　勝北草地　十一比四</p>
<p>勝南草地　八比七　勝南草地　十二比三</p>
<p>勝法商會　十三比二　勝法商會　十二比三</p>
<p>勝葡萄牙　九比六　勝葡萄牙　十二比三</p>
<p>勝斜橋　十四比一　勝斜　橋　十五比○</p>
<p>敗於鄉下　七比八　勝鄉下會　十一比五</p>
<p>勝日本會　十比五　敗於中華　五比十</p>
<p>總結　七六比二九　總結　七八比二七</p>
<p>昨日應得而失之錦標</p>
<p>觀前列成績、昨日中華會控制全塲、十二比三·十一比四、俱爲可能事實、然結果爲十比五者、可勝而失之也、第一組林鄭勢如破竹、六比一先勝、第二盤以五比二居先、而結果因取之太易、竟爲日人追成五比五、而終以八比十奉送之、寗非怪事、而第三第五兩組、果能皆再多勝一盤、則亦萬事解决、最後决勝負之第二組末一盤、苦戰而以七比九失敗、豈非倖運不濟達於極點、而統觀日本隊實平凡無足奇也、</p>
<p>林寳華鄭兆佳克服勁敵</p>
<p>昨日興趣、集中於林鄭對俵町之第一組因二隊皆從未曾失敗、不啻爭上海雙打冠軍、而足爲扶輪杯勝負之預測也、</p>
<p>林鄭操縱全塲　球勢球藝、林鄭皆能左右操縱、直落之意中之事、俵氏開球、林鄭卽獲之、嗣日人奪回局、此後一瀉千里林鄭連勝五局而勝第一盤、</p>
<p>勝之太易而失　第二盤鄭發球、勢仍不衰、三比○握於掌中、飛來惡運、林鄭以勝之太易漸露鬆弛然仍以五比二居、先豈料日人乘機進取連得三局、中華仍以六比五、七比六佔優、然鄭漸露疲狀、發球局一失、第二盤遂去、</p>
<p>林寳華之傑作　第二盤失此一着第三盤乃努力加鞭、不費吹灰、再以六比一勝之、林寳華昨日之表演、因大敵臨前、可謂難得之傑作、角球置球擱網重抽、俱恃得讚好不少、曾有數次重抽、竟置俵氏於不能回手、鄭兆佳仍有正手稍欠把握之病、而時時處於被動地位、日人之敗、則町田之不濟、然町較之去年、已大進步矣、</p>
<p>優游盃前日錢郭第二盤尚未賽畢定今日　賽、二方必出全力以爭、其餘余屠及劉梁二組亦定有相當戰績、兹將今日秩序列下、</p>
<p>下午四時　下午五時半</p>
<p>汪民祝對李庸　錢耀彬對郭啟達</p>
<p>屠開元對余田光　吳祝仁對沈柏貴</p>
<p>馬安權對唐永純　劉　　對梁官英</p>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>消夏的謎（下）</h3>
<p>— 廬</p>
<p>納凉的諸君，又在這小小園地相會了。</p>
<p>上次買獻的三個謎面，諸君猜中也好，猜不中也好：我却不能不自己拆穿這個西洋鏡，把謎底一齊披露：</p>
<p>（一）暴日當空，高唱着無道皇帝論調的，便是蟬。暴日越是當空，蟬的聲調越高只是知了知了呌個不休！所以，蟬的别名，便是知了。｜也有寫作𧊄蟟的從前皇帝論調，只把知道�</p>
<p>了三字做口頭禪蟬也是高唱着知道了，只少去了一個道字，所以，說它是舞道皇帝。這個謎兒，很容易猜容易猜做倚仗暴日勢力的溥儀：其實，溥儀也是可憐蟲，和高唱知了的蟬，不相上下，待到秋凉，暴日的勢力一衰，只怕也要變做秋後的噤口寒蟬了。</p>
<p>（二）重光葵截腿以後，左傳上一句成語，失了效力：這句成語，呌做：｜夫葵猶能衛其足。只爲葵葉傾日不令日光照其根，所以有葵能衛足的成語。重光葵失去了，足那麽葵不能衛其足了！那麽左傳上的成語失其效力了。</p>
<p>（三）援馬援，馬援可對哀。牛哀牛哀上聯，倒看順看皆是這五字：下聯，倒看順看也是這五字。上聯，馬援是古人，借比抗日的馬占山將軍；下聯，牛哀也是古人，　淮南子上說牛哀病七日，化而爲虎，云云。借比絶食要挾的牛蘭分明是個哀黨行爲，郤也可以喚他一聲牛哀。爲着牛氏絶食，有人哀憐他，要設法援救他出險所以，哀牛哀牛哀。五字，也和時局有關。再者，上海近聞，有一條待宰的黃牛，半路脫沈逃，到某廠裏面，向廠主跪地哀求，涙如雨下，廠主動了不忍之心，便買了下來牽往放生局，保全牛命，這條跪地哀求的黃牛，也可以喚做牛哀，廠主保全牛命，也是哀牛哀牛哀所不同的，絶食的牛，和跪地的牛，一是假牛，一是眞牛罷了。</p>
<h3>託愛斯庫夫人</h3>
<p>— 屈誠</p>
<p>玉佛寺旁。檳榔路中。有黑漆石庫門。門樓彫以李杜對奕者。乃故英僑巨商『惠德豐』氏女及婿之居也。其婿姓愛斯庫。名福勞倫斯。Ｆlorance　Ayscough前惠德豐洋行中一寫字員耳。爲人性冷僻。處事頗幹練。以是得女靑睞。結婚後。女父以老病死。此巨萬之遺產。亦隨夫人歸愛矣。</p>
<p>夫人居恒喜習我國文學。即飲食起居。亦靡不以「非中國化」者不樂。積十餘年之研究。於我國詩文頗具心得乃。從事迻譯唐詩。以介紹於彼邦人士。坎拿大某大學耳其名。贈以博士學位。</p>
<p>自是。夫人於學益勤。名亦益著。每當其演講時。聽者恒以萬計。嘗于無線電台播音至各國。詞皆讚揚我國禮義。于婦女之「貞節」「三從四德」等舊道德。尤宣傳不遺餘力。夫人更以身作則于其夫實不亞孟莊之于梁鴻也。</p>
<p>經夫人數年之大聲疾呼。彼邦學者及婦女于其學乃漸加注意。如此則繼夫人之後而推行其道者。必大有人在今我摩登女子方鄙棄固有之道德。。與彼夫人之視若珍璧者相較。能不有愧于中乎</p>
<h3>消夏散記</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>旬日以來。上海温度驟增。最熱時。達百零三度。開年來未有之新紀錄。於是海上人士。竟謀所以避暑之方。爰擇其雋永新趣者錄之。亦浮李沉瓜中之談助也。</p>
<p>兆豐急雨　海上逭暑勝地。厥爲四大公園。而尤以兆豐之濃蔭蔽野。白石淸泉。最爲中西人士所樂趨。職是每當夕陽西下。嬋聲晚唱之際。兆豐公園。遂爲士女萃會之地。把臂同游。依稀仙境某日溽暑薰蒸。炎威若炙。兆豐之門。於五時已見車水馬龍之盛况。該園爲娛樂游侣計。復聘請某西樂隊入塲奏樂徴費四角。聽者亦座爲之滿。五時半樂聲甫奏忽見濃雲四合。急雨如注。於是一曲未終奏者聘者。莫不倉皇奔避。一種狼狽之情景。實屬無可描摹。愚是時方在赴動物園途中。四望無處可供棲避。乃權立巨樹下。期賴濃蔭。獲片刻之苟安。無如雨勢愈趨愈急經一刻鐘而益滂沱。予之襯衣。盡遭水濕。草帽爲雨灌注。幾如落湯之雞。一時婦女之呼號聲。兒童之哭喊聲。融成一片。與風雨聲相應和焉。歷半小時雨稍殺。乃步出園門。一般御薄如蟬翼之時裝少女。尤爲淋漓盡致。羣呼天公不做美云</p>
<p>浦江快渡　公園久游。意興蕭索。友人倡作浦江夜渡。議甫出。而應者十餘人。各携眷與偕。下午八時半羣集於外灘銅人渡頭。魚貫而登市公用局之渡輪。輪分二級。最上者曰特等。西人居多數。往返一元五角次曰頭等。往返八角。輪旣開行。淸風習習襲衣襟。稍焉。去海上繁華之閙市區域愈遠。但見漁舟三五漂蕩江心。隔岸烟霧迷漫。不辨何所。旣而皓月初升。巨如車輪。江水淪漣。暉映奪目。吾儕憑欄話舊。暑氣全消。曉光伉儷復以所備食物分贈朋儕。雜坐歡騰。樂乃無藝舟行半小時。泊東溝。歷十五分鐘。又溯江上駛。九時許抵高橋。相偕登岸。維時江風微拂。恍若初秋。步行約四分鐘。抵一旅舍。電炬燦然。陳設尚佳。内備冷食餐點。代價殊昻予等至一茶肆品茗。圍坐半句鐘。江月如畫。萬里晴空鄉村風物。别饒佳趣。十一時返舟。塵俗盡除。風勢轉急。。於笑語歌嘯聲中。重返歇浦。已逾午夜矣</p>
<h3>溽暑薰蒸憶頂湖</h3>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>肇慶之頂湖山爲華南著名之大山。即佛家所謂天下第十七福地。羣山環繞。風景偉麗。古木鬱森。日光不透。山腰藏有佔地三十畝莊嚴巍峨古刹一座。曰慶雲寺。雕梁畫樓。雄壯無比寺僧三百有餘。工役小童。數亦相埒。内備雅潔客房數十。供遊人寄宿。寺左有震盪山谷飛流千尺之瀑布。山巓有常有雲霞擁護之老頂湖寺。山中名勝古蹟。留題甚多。如洗心亭上。有丙辰護國之役章太炎到遊。親題「滌瑕盪垢」横額。大雄寳殿側之客堂。有孫中山所書「衆生平等」「一切有情」楹帖。及岺春煊之「萬山深處」横匾。階下有何瑞丹書長聯。「如是我聞。風聲。雨聲。泉聲。烏聲。和滿院禪聲。入斯門一聲頓悟」。「於今可見。山色雲色。樹色。及四時景色。到此地衆色皆空」。渾成脫俗。異常貼切。山上又有世界獨產之吊鐘花。及五色杜鵑。石仙桃。紫貝天葵。奇葩異卉。不計其數。多可入藥。由羅隠涌登山。歷程十八里。方達慶雲寺。沿途如鳥飛鳴。泉聲潺潺。滿山蒼翠薰風時來。冬温夏淸。掃盡塵氛。飛水潭中。微風吹來。細浪花浮。淸澈見底。游泳沐浴。凉透心脾。鐘聲樹影。萬念俱淸。幾疑身在廣寒宮。不復知有夏間酷熱每値炎暑。遊客之衆。不亞於浙之莫干贛之匡廬。北方之靑島北戴河等逭暑名區。余曾三次往遊。棲遲匝月時當炎夏。每憶舊蹤。輒爲神往。泚筆至此。凉風颯颯。不啻置身於眠綠亭中。然念心丹殂逝。慧空遠别。思新感舊。。棖觸前鏖。雖値溽暑。又不禁而有秋思矣</p>
<h3>値得介紹的國貨工廠（十二）</h3>
<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>（二）（一）煤球工廠</p>
<p>煤煤發明於我國。原係廢物利用。當初海上煤業大王劉鴻聲君。見煤屑之委棄可惜。化五千金飭日人構造製造煤球機器。機成。立中華煤球工廠。營業蒸蒸日上。迄今中華分有一二三三廠矣。事在人爲。此不得不歸功劉君之卓見與毅力也。</p>
<p>上海煤球工廠。共有十餘家。如中華中國大中華大中國遠東華成國華南洋等。大都在浦東及斜徐路一帶。</p>
<p>煤球淸潔耐火。人多樂用惟須白煤屑製之。蓋燃用煤球之爐。大都無烟囱故烟煤之屑。未能適用。當製造煤球時。煤屑中必和以黃土。黃土以來自蘇州者爲佳。蓋性粘質鬆。一則容易堅結。一則容易燃燒。非他處黃土所可及。或謂煤球中和有易燃之料此不經之談也。每噸煤屑。可攙黃土二成至三成。然最好攙一成七。多則不但不耐火。且不易燃着。實則煤球之優劣。除煤質有關係外。黃土攙加之多少。大有關係。</p>
<p>我國產白煤不少。然仍供不應求。設以大批煤屑製球用。當然不足。除山西少數之白煤屑購用外。大批都來自安南。日本多烟煤。不能適用。</p>
<p>製造煤球機器。我國機廠。現在皆能仿造。機有大小。有一轉出球一百十四個者。有一百四十個者。至一百六十個者。價約二千元左右。</p>
<p>製造煤球。雖可用手工。如打炭基然者然欲求出賣。非利用機器不可。全部機器分三件。（一）磨細機。（二）調和泥水機。（三）造球機煤屑須經上項三種手續始成球。乃由造球機下部。如雨而下。承以鐵絲篩上烘灶之烘乾。用人工裝入籮中。</p>
<p>上項機器。日出煤球三十至四十噸。市價每噸二十四元上下。至安南煤屑。市價每噸十一兩左右。</p>
<p>六十四</p>

<h3>洋釐賡續低墜</h3>
<p>市場情形　昨日銀洋市况可分兩種情形、銀的市面以拆票交易逐漸增加、需要似有進展景象、故市價亦大致轉優、雖頭襯毋慮缺乏、究以有感困難之處、卒至轉有希望、洋厘以當此廢革聲中、厘價地位動摇、現在多空旣無差額、自無競爭舉動、故結果逐漸遜色而低墜耳、</p>
<p>厘跌拆俏　「洋厘」早市厘價較前日跌去半厘、爲六錢九分一厘午市續跌半厘、爲六錢九分零半厘‘結果兩市共跌一厘’「銀拆」早午兩市同爲一錢五分、較前日又高一分、銀行掛牌仍爲六分、而劃頭加水初爲二錢、最後收盤則爲一錢六分、蓋頭襯緊鬆適度故焉、</p>

<h3>紐約股市反動㣲跌</h3>
<p>（美東銀公司報告）</p>
<p>週二紐約股市、開盤價仍較前日高翔、但未幾賣風漸盛蓋係短期進出者之套利舉動雖行市之回跌尚不甚烈、成交達一百五十萬股、又是日爲美國鋼鐵公司發表股息之期、市塲上人心惶惶、多數交易商皆暫停活動、靜候消息之傳佈、嗣該公司卒宣佈僅發優先股股息、而於普通股仍行停付息金、比消息發表後、該公司股票卽跌落一點、惟因爲時已遜、故未發生其他影響、但信一般人對此未必大感失望、因多數人早已預料及之也週二股市之回跌、在實業界反覺歡迎養如此能使多數意存購買、而失却低價之機會者、仍能加入也就日前形勢而觀、套利之舉似尚未完全停止、但信此種反動、不久必能回復也、附道瓊斯指數如左、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市驟轉疲落</h3>
<p>客銷稍滯：空頭大量抛出</p>
<p>人心略軟：市盤跌一兩餘</p>
<p>棉紗市情轉趨疲落、形勢較弱、因客銷停滯、不若前日之踴躍、以致人心略軟、市盤遂現不振之狀、惟榮興大户多頭仍安然不動、在近月仍購進加碼、至於賣方、以各帮實需大批出過之後、恐有一度長久停頓、且世界市况平澹、故在遠月抛賣、目前多空兩方、角逐劇烈但各廠底貨銷罄銀根方面、鬆動不少、態度安靜紗市一時亦不致於大落也、</p>

<h3>現棉售價堅挺</h3>
<p>七月鄭標交貨不旺</p>
<p>棉市較堅、因美棉平定、而金市趨漲、故賣方堅力雖重、本棉存貨太枯、市價鞏固異常、買方以目前紗銷起色、各廠採辦現棉甚旺、故現貨售價堅挺、人心帶緊、而七月份交割貨物未見踴旺、於是多方心神愈覺安穏云、</p>
<p>八月鄭標獨緊　鄭標前市開盤、八月份市氣反緊塲中賣户缺乏、獨漲二錢、遠月平平、二三般仍無變動、收盤略小、結果近漲五分至一錢、遠跌五分、成交統計三萬二千三百擔、查賣出長豐二千三百擔、義餘二千擔、恊生二千二百擔、餘昶一千四百擔、穗隆一千六百擔、達記一千一百擔買進吉豐二千二百擔、遠大二千三百擔、大昶二千四百擔、益豐一千八百擔、兹將鄭標收盤價分列如下、</p>

<h3>廢兩改元研究會昨開第一次會</h3>
<p>對新幣制度意見尚未一致</p>
<p>本星期六擬繼續開會討論</p>
<p>廢兩改元問題、自財長宋子文來滬、與本埠銀錢各界交換意見後、已定原則三項、特組研究委員會、聘請中外專家七人、並函邀銀行錢業及市商會推派代表、參與會商綜合意見、以備政府之參考、第一次研席會、於昨日午後三時、在中央銀行三樓舉行、約五時散會、並預定本月三十日（星期六）下午、在同處繼續討論、兹將各情探錄如左、</p>
<p>出席之委員　昨日會議、出席者、計有委員陳健庵·貝淞蓀·胡筆江·凱末·麥照特·及雷祺·等六人、並錢業界代表俞佐廷、市商會代表馬驥良、委員劉鴻生、及銀行公會代表胡孟嘉、均因事未曾出席、</p>
<p>會議之情形　會議於三時開始、陳健庵主席、首由主席報告、略謂本委員會、係研究性質、對於廢兩改元問題、就財宋參照各界意見所定之三項原則、再總集各界意見、從長研究、以供政府採納報告畢、卽由各委員及代表發表意見、因新幣發行問題、而羣集其注意點於幣制條例、緣民國三年、政府曾頒布幣制條例、其所定重量、爲七錢二分以上、殆後新幣鑄造、未盡遵條例、故市面通貨混亂、此次洋厘暴跌、雖由於内地生產凋敝、上海現貨集中所致、但硬幣之混亂、重量之不一、乃其重要原因、故廢兩改元後之新幣鑄造、非但須求成色之統一、且須求適合民三條例、不使人民受無形之損失、而對於輔幣之鑄造、亦須注意以行十淮位、而利便人民之交易、另一方面意見則因改鑄新幣所需之鑄費爲數至鉅、政府際此外患内憂交迫之下、似難担任、故認爲有減輕新幣重量以資補償之心要、如此、則人民負擔加重、廢兩改元原爲民衆謀利便、而益加人民負擔、似非政府之主旨、故各人意見、尚不能一致乃、决定於本月三十日下午二時半、仍在原處繼續商討云、</p>
<p>陳行之談話　據該會委員陳行語中央社記者云、今日會議、完全是研究性質、故無若何决議、對於三項原則、均已加以鄭重之研究、對於法幣之製造、有主民三制、有主他種制度、各方意見不一、故須加以詳細之研、究因該項問題、非常重要云、</p>

<h3>硬做媳婦與貞操問題</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>貞操問題，在現代的潮流中，雖已根本不能成立，但是女子要守節守貞，在法律原無明文限制，因爲貞操本是道德問題並非法律問題。</p>
<p>蘇州縣立中學學生馬寳麟，與未婚妻女職學生徐釆貞雙服毒案，馬以毒深身死，徐延醫得救，嗣後徐以未婚妻資格，要求爲馬守節，經馬家長堅拒，徐釆貞遂與馬之庶母張氏，互相揪扭，各受微傷，致成訟案，蓋徐釆貞以未婚妻資格，而願爲馬寳麟守節，在此「朝秦暮楚」「人盡夫也」的世界，未始不可以矯薄俗而勵淳風。</p>
<p>然而不時髦矣，并且做烈婦易，做節婦難，烈婦不過激於一時血氣，奮不顧身，或服毒自盡或引頸自裁，尚容易做到，若節婦則所謂「妾心古井水，波瀾誓不起，」此種境界，非常難過，年齡尚靑，而志意未决環境誘惑而芳心易摇，茹苦含辛，原非人道，從前守節易，現在守節難，從前女子，不出家門，惡劣環境，尚少誘惑，現在社交公開，所謂不見可欲而心不亂者，見可欲則未必不亂，與其有初而鮮終，何必多此一舉。</p>
<p>從前未婚婦爲未婚夫守節，本有抱牌做親等事，但此種慘無人道之舉動，實爲人世所難堪，即在當時，城一般的心理上，亦視爲過情之舉動，蓋旣曰未婚，則原未完全取得妻之身分，則守節之舉，自可不必，而徐釆貞之不必守節，更爲顯而易見的事，馬張氏旣經拒絶於前即使要求勉强應允，亦安能度其寗靜之生活，并且其子尚因責言而自甘一死，，則其媳安能聚久而得以相安，恐亦萬無是理，再進數步言，旣要守節不必過門，即在家中長抱獨身主義，終身誓不嫁人，亦可對先夫於地下，何必過門然後謂之守節？</p>
<p>此次未婚夫婦之雙服毒案，其所以服毒之原因，是否僅因庶母責言，而自尋短見，還是尚有别種原因，雖尚不得而知，倘是該未婚夫婦並無庶母别種虐待情形，僅僅爲一句責言而死，其死可謂毫無理由，若其庶母平日酷辣凶狠，難度生活，情願以一死了之，則徐釆</p>
<p>貞何以硬欲過門守節，此種矛盾的理由，眞令人莫測矣！</p>

<p>製鏡的手續，可分爲四個段落，（Ａ）材料，（Ｂ）製液，（Ｃ）鍍銀，及（Ｄ）修飾。</p>
<p>（Ａ）製鏡的玻璃最適宜者，爲厚約二三分的玻璃，須擇其無空氣泡而平整的，最好是鉀玻璃，然後先以亞摩尼亞水洗摩，或炭酸鈉水亦可，去牠的油漬，再於在水中以濕布拭淨，再洗以蒸溜水。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）製鍍銀液有用酒石酸鉀鈉，有用酒石酸，有用果糖，中以用酒石酸爲最宜，其法先製成甲乙兩液，（甲）液是用中性硝酸銀一錢，水十兩，（以百分之一計，）將其溶解在水中，再逐漸加以亞摩尼亞水，使牠沈澱，濾淸去汚穢，放在瓶内，把瓶放在黑暗處，可保存一週，（乙）液用硝酸銀二分，容解在十兩，水的沸水中，加以一·六六分的酒石酸鉀鈉成茶色，乘熱放入瓶中，并攄去渣滓。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）將玻璃水中拿出，用乾布拭乾，把甲乙兩液混合等量相同，急速傾在玻璃面上，用箸來散開全幅，由玫瑰色而赤色而黑暗，約卅分鐘，即變成美麗的金光。</p>
<p>（Ｄ）上面的鍍銀的工作，待銀乾後，輕輕地注以假漆，使可受磨擦，再塗以洋漆，而後才告成功，成爲一塊有用的鏡了。</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>關於「改良婚姻制度」之我見</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>我讀了本刋張鼎銘先生所提出的「改良婚姻制度之建議」以後，我覺得我有說話的必要。然而在這裏爲了顧及發表時的便利起見只能具體的約略申述之如下。</p>
<p>現在我們先得研究中國婚制之經濟關係。</p>
<p>一切社會現象都不能離開經濟關係而存在，這是無可否認的基本原則。因爲先有了某種形態的經濟基礎，然後才有某種形式的諸現象相應而生。中國現代的經濟，不消說完全是私有制度的，不僅如此，而且還深陷在半封建性的泥坑中，即是說中國經濟在帝國主義的威壓之下，並没有完全走上資本主義的道路之可能，雖然在某幾個大的都市中已有了資本主義的形式。在這種基調之下，於是那封建的私有的家庭經濟便個别的被攫奪在家長的掌握中當然個别的家長便因此在家庭中。有着絶大的權威，其對於子女完全是支配者與被支配者的聯繫。被支配的奴隸似的子女之一切，决然脫不出握有全部經濟的家長之桎梏，當然子女的婚姻也便不能例外。那末這裏便說明了所謂「父母之命」「媒妁之言」等婚姻制度之所以產生的根源了。譬如說以子女的婚姻爲仕途的酬答品，以子女的婚姻變爲商品而與有利於己者交易；這在現代中國社會中都可找着充分的例證，關於這一點，｜舊婚姻制度之毒弊｜｜張先生已詳爲說明，茲不贅述。而上面所叙述者，亦僅爲說明其所以如此的原因而已。</p>
<p>如上所述，在祷樣人吃人的現代經濟制度中，對於這畸形現象之一的婚姻制度欲謀改革，我想無論計劃得怎樣周密，結果終是「改良」而已；而且甚至於徒爲理想不能實現於事實。</p>
<p>「時代下的婚姻標準，不宜夾雜以物質…條件」對的，這樣「審愼於初」，或許「不會得到痛苦的結果」，然而在這封建的兼有資本主義的「畸形式的社會中」，一切的一切，都有其物質條件，尤其是從來没有經濟地位的中國女性，其能不靠着結婚之後而從丈夫身那裏獲得物質的需要嗎？即在充分具有資本主義形式上海的女性而論。有又幾個能夠獨立生活而不求助於丈夫呢？反之，中國女性始終在家長的酬答或交易的狀態之下而轉入丈夫的繫絆中。這裏便是一絶大的「物質條件」問題。不必說這一問題現在還没有隨着大革命而得着絲毫解决那末即使經過了充分的「品性」「學力」「愛力」「家庭狀况」的「考察」或「調查」，或「試騐」以及「了解一之後，然而因着必然的物質條件之變化，其愛情能不亦隨之而變化嗎？</p>
<p>所以，婚制問題始終是經濟問題中的一個分野，而經濟問題又必須隨着徹底的大革命才得解决。現在中國的先决條件並未解决。其枝節問題的「婚制」，無論其若何程度的「改良」，充其量亦不過「改良」而已。</p>
<p>至於設若先决問題已獲得徹底的解决，即是經濟形態已非封建性的或資本主義性的，那末婚姻已不再受物質條件之束縛，當然也就不需要一切形式藉以約束戀愛成熟便可同居，因爲有機的愛情决不是可以制限的東西。</p>
<p>最後，我願意這一點意見能夠引起廣泛的而熱烈的討論。</p>
<h3>公園之夜</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>這富於誘惑性的公園之夜，原是學生時代舊游的樂園，當我踏上人生之途，一切的靑春生活，被麫包的呼聲懾服了，公園，跳舞塲，愛，都像夢一樣的渺茫。</p>
<p>昨晚上，訪結婚後的好友Ｔ，他們的小家庭正在租界的神秘之街辣斐德路旁，談話的終點，就喊出到公園去，我不置可否的跟了他們走。</p>
<p>踏進公園的門，我似乎翻開了自己的日記，過去的生活從朦朧中醒來，小溪，幽徑都是我獨自徘徊的舊地，而今蹂滿了仕女芳踪，雙雙，對對，細語如鶯　於公園增了如許旖旎　光，我的意識上終如失去了的童心一樣不可恢復的悔恨，踏着破碎的月影慢步，我的心頭感到隠痛，如鐵踵蹛壓上我的心房。</p>
<p>我們點點的走，各人懐着不同的情緒一陣歌聲從茅亭中送來Ohl　MyDearl　My　Lovel我打了個寒驚望着Ｔ夫婦相偎拾級而上，我就在路旁的椅上坐了下來，　月光照着我，身影斜在路旁，我微笑的感謝她，身影終生没有離開我，同時感謝月光的好意。</p>
<p>「萍怎麽」Ｔ發現了我没有上茅亭，返身問我，</p>
<p>「我乏力」我不願破壞美景良辰說了謊。</p>
<p>他們别我而去了，我昏昏然步出園門，回望園裏黑黝黝的像地獄一般從朦朧中醒來的夢，重被麫包之魔喊了歸去。</p>
<p>我長長的舒了一口氣，飛上黃包車像逃難似的返寓。</p>
<p>性的問題</p>
<h3>再醮</h3>
<p>— 士志</p>
<p>在未開通的某一市鎭上，｜我的家鄉｜最近發生了一件寡婦再醮的事情，因受舊禮敎束縛的緣故，不免爲本鎭人士所指摘；攻擊尤其是十八世紀的老者。但是我很竭力的替她解釋，而認爲她是勇敢而且具有毅力。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：那寡婦Ｓ女士，是智識階級中人。曾受高等的敎育，現在任滬上某小學的級任，每月的薪金亦有五六十元。可是她從前的家境很淸貧，所以她求學時的一切用途，都由她已過的丈夫Ｗ君所供給。他們倆是從小訂婚的，在未結婚前，兩人共同研討學問，感情至爲融洽。後女士與ＳＷ君同時畢業於某大學，兩人始行正式結婚。不幸得很，結婚後的第七日。Ｓ女士唯一的丈夫Ｗ君，竟因用腦過度，以致一疾不起。當Ｗ君臨死的時候，他曾含滬吩咐他心目中的Ｓ女士：呌她不必爲他守節，而犧牲她人生的幸福惟希望她永遠維護他的老母｜她的婆婆｜而已。</p>
<p>Ｓ女士自Ｗ君死後，雖想起了丈夫温存體貼，而痛不欲生。可是爲了家庭的經濟關係便執敎於滬上某小學。很安分的過她獨孤底苦悶底生活，來維持她婆婆的生活。她婆婆雖死了可愛的兒子，而得到了這樣賢淑的媳婦，於内心也得到了不少的安慰。</p>
<p>Ｓ女士這樣底過了六年的苦悶的生活，她自信很對得起亡夫的恩愛。</p>
<p>最近她想到前途的黑暗她覺到性的飢渴；又受到潮流的趨勢；她見到哄動一時的陶女士與蔣校長奮鬭而結合。爲了以上種種的關係：便使她毅然的與她認爲滿意的Ｋ君實行正式訂婚以固定她的前途，解决她性的問題。</p>
<p>的確。守節是慘酷的，尤其是正在靑春時代的Ｓ女士，所以我對Ｓ女士此次的再醮，是很表同情，還希望他倆早締良緣！</p>
<p>可是Ｓ女士實行再醮後，勢將與以前的婆婆脫離關係，那麽她婆婆再有誰來維持她的生活呢？所以我最後希望Ｓ女士不拘什麽名義，仍繼續底維持以前的婆婆的生活，那麽於事理上，良心上都可派司，</p>

<h3>Europe's Challenge to America (Part Two) Bin</h3>
<p>Has America thus conquered Europe for good? In other words, can the capitalist world be stabilized for the long term based on the Treaty of Versailles, the Dawes Plan, or the Young Plan? Of course, this is absolutely impossible. Due to the endless squeezing of reparations, Germany has been in dire straits for over a decade, depleted of blood and withered of skin. When there is no way to extract any more, Germany's only way out is to appeal for a revision of the treaty. In other words, to reduce reparations, or to cancel them altogether. This has begun to shake the foundation of war debts, which are inextricably linked to reparations. Secondly, due to Germany's decline, European countries are all deteriorating. At the same time, due to the difficulty of life, Germany's social thought is increasingly leaning to the left, which further threatens European countries. The capitalist powers all know that without freeing Germany from the shackles of reparations, Germany's economy will never be improved. The growth of leftist forces, or even the outbreak of revolution, is inevitable. Therefore, the call for "canceling reparations and war debts at one stroke" has been constantly shouted from the mouths of British and Italian politicians for several years. Although France, because it is always preventing Germany's revival, has not agreed to this proposal, it is an undeniable fact that the foundation of war debts is becoming more and more shaky as a result. Furthermore, since the second half of 1929, the frenzy of the world economic panic has shaken the rule of capitalism with unprecedented force. Capitalists and financiers in general are at a loss, and believe that reparations and war debts are the root cause of the economic panic. Therefore, resolving the reparations and war debt problem in order to save the end of capitalism is advocated by more shortsighted economists. For this reason, US President Hoover resolutely put forward a plan last year to suspend war debt reparations for one year to ease the international atmosphere, and to give Europe a chance to breathe. He hoped to restore world prosperity thereby, and for a time won the reputation of a clever creditor. However, a year has passed. Germany's decline remains the same, and the world's decline also remains the same. Moreover, all the contradictions have become more profound and expanded. Therefore, the Lausanne Conference was convened. At the same time, no matter how much the United States expressed its unwillingness to participate, and no matter how much it stated that reparations and war debts could not be discussed together, the Lausanne Treaty was finally signed, and the Four-Power Gentlemen's Agreement was established progressively, followed by the Anglo-French Agreement. Then, Germany, Italy, and Belgium all joined this agreement, which is a clear threat to the United States to give up war debts with a unified pace.</p>
<p>The United States' response to this challenge is that war debts can be reduced, but Europe must reduce its military spending as a condition. He cleverly linked reparations and war debts to disarmament. Therefore, at the Disarmament Conference, Mr. Hoover put forward an astonishing disarmament plan. Recently, US Senator Borah advocated convening a world conference to consider revising or abolishing war debts. However, at the same time, he repeatedly stated that if there were no disarmament treaty or other agreements to support it, he would still firmly oppose the abolition of war debts. The significance of this fact is that the United States is unwilling to give up war debts, allowing Europe to have the spare capacity to expand its military, in order to fully prepare for the Second World War. This exposes the contradictions between capitalist countries.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in Tianjin Conduct Street Fighting Exercises</h3>
<p>Changing Sentry Passwords Every Night at the Border</p>
<p>Anxious Tianjin Residents; Military and Police Increase Security</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Tightly Deployed Along the North-Peiping Railway's Extramural Section</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin have been conducting street fighting exercises with infantry and artillery for days. Armed sentries are stationed at the Sino-Japanese border every night, changing the password twice every four hours, acting quite nervously. On the 27th, they went to the Northwest Corner Garden to inspect the water plant, secretly surveying the geography of the Chinese concession, causing anxiety among the residents and a widespread rumor of a disturbance on the 28th. However, our military and police have taken strict precautions, making it difficult to realize. On the morning of the 27th, the Japanese army transported 100,000 hemp bags and wireless telegraph machines, military pigeons, electric nets, etc., loading them onto four freight cars to Shanhaiguan. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side along the North-Peiping Railway outside Shanhaiguan is tightly deployed. Bridges of all sizes at each station have been built into solid fortresses. Defense works have been set up at each important station, and armored vehicles patrol and defend the area. Many Russian and Korean Jinzhou people have replaced the railway police.

<h3>Anti-Japanese Troops Active Along the Siping-Taonan Railway Line</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Yesterday, 300 anti-Japanese troops attacked the Japanese railway guards at Quanjiadian on the Siping-Taonan line. After a fierce battle with the Japanese army, they retreated.

<h3>Japanese Postal Power Develops After the Northeast Postal Blockade</h3>
<p>Qingdao Municipal Government Protests the Establishment of Japanese Post Offices</p>
<p>Plans to Expand the Eurasia Airline Route</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Northeast post office blockade, Japanese post offices have begun to operate. Many postal workers entering Shanhaiguan are detained en route. The Shenyang postmaster, Mr. Bolerdi, is loyal to his duties and determined not to cooperate with the Japanese. Mail from the Northeast to the mainland is forwarded by the Dalian Japanese post office, and mail to Europe and the United States is sent out by the Changchun post office. This blockade has no impact on Japan, only showing our determination. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese have set up ten post offices at each station between Dalian and Changchun, limited to postal transport on the South Manchurian Railway. If they go to the Chinese mainland, they must add Chinese postage stamps. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The Japanese arbitrarily set up a temporary post office in this area.

The Japanese consul's reply was stubborn, saying that if necessary, they would establish international post offices in Qingdao and Shanghai. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Northeast postal blockade, in addition to changing the route of mail to Europe and the Americas to be delivered via the Suez Canal or the Pacific Ocean, the transportation authorities are also planning to expand the branch lines of the Eurasia Airline to facilitate transportation, which is being actively discussed. As for the request of Japanese residents in Shanghai to the Japanese consulate to open temporary post offices, it has been found that foreign postal rights in China have long been abolished. No country can undermine the integrity of another country's postal service, and the international postal agreement contains clear provisions. It seems that the Japanese authorities' unreasonable demands will not be realized soon. This matter belongs to a diplomatic issue, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be prepared to deal with it. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than fifty postal workers from the Northeast arrived in Tianjin on the 27th, and more than one hundred went to Peiping.

Many were recognized by Japanese spies and taken off the train on the Fengshan Railway, and their lives are of great concern. Those who have not left are afraid of being monitored by the Japanese and it is not easy to escape. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The post office here received instructions from Nanjing to stop working from Monday evening. After that, mail to foreign countries may have to use Japanese post offices.

The "Manchukuo" is now trying hard to take over the post office. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The post office under the administration of "Manchukuo" and the Japanese began to operate part of the business this morning.

<h3>Declaration of the Joint Conference of Postal Workers on Protecting Postal Rights</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Postal Workers' Joint Conference issued a declaration on protecting postal rights on the 27th, saying that our Northeast postal service is the most important postal area of our Chinese postal service. The Japanese government has not fulfilled the Washington Conference Treaty and refuses to abolish the South Manchurian Railway Post Office, destroying the integrity of Chinese postal sovereignty. Since the September 18th Incident, it has conspired to obstruct the administration of postal affairs. Recently, it has unscrupulously used its puppet organization in Manchuria to forcibly seize our two districts' public property, detain public funds, issue counterfeit postage stamps, and force their use, making it impossible for our two districts' postal administration to function and temporarily suspended operations. The conference representatives and postal workers across the nation, for the Japanese government's violent seizure, solemnly declare: "We will oppose their behavior." In addition to requesting the government to transfer all Northeast postal workers into Shanhaiguan unconditionally and assign them to serve in various postal districts and resolutely implement the blockade policy, and to telegraph the International Postal Union and the International Postal Bureau to pay attention, we hereby solemnly declare." They also sent a telegram to the Northeast postal workers, saying, "The violent sun is rampant, seizing postal services, invading our sovereignty, and oppressing our compatriots. Comrades outside Shanhaiguan have suffered humiliation and hardship, fighting for the country. The conference has opened, and the comrades are deeply concerned. We send our condolences by telegram." Another telegram was sent to the Postal Economic System Research Committee, saying, "The implementation of a plan to consolidate the postal base is related to the rise and fall of Chinese postal services and has long been demanded by the people of the country. Since the postal workers' unions in various regions have proposed it, your committee has been commissioned to study the implementation methods. At this conference, we unanimously resolved to telegraph your committee, asking you to consider the future of the postal service and promptly request the government to implement the plan to consolidate the postal base as soon as possible, so as to establish a long-term foundation for the postal service." The urgency of the telegram cannot be overstated. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Postal Workers' Joint Conference held its third meeting on the morning of the 27th and resolved: (1) Postal worker representatives should participate in the Postal Pension and Relief Fund Management Committee; (2) Post office buildings across the country should be self-built; (3) Post office employees and supplies across the country should use domestic products; (4) Request to ban private letter offices; (5) Postal workers' working hours should be limited to eight hours; (6) Postal worker vacancies should be filled immediately; (7) Revise the Postal Outline; (8) Expand postal routes and add post offices; (9) Postage stamps, remittance slips, stationery, and all other printed matter should be printed domestically; (10) Postal economy should be made public; (11) Revise the current organizational law of the General Postal Bureau; (12) Postal workers should be given special leave for union affairs; (13) Organize consumer cooperatives for postal workers in various places, etc. The meeting continued in the afternoon, and the proposals will be released after being sorted out.

<h3>Japan Prepares for Far East War</h3>
<p>Drafting a National Mobilization Plan</p>
<p>Starting Exercises from Northern Kyushu First</p>
<p>Japanese Government Openly Appoints Officials</p>
<p>To Take Over All Powers of the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency Osaka Telegram, 27th: In order to prepare for a Far East war, Japan, with the Cabinet Resources Bureau as the center, is jointly studying a national mobilization plan with the authorities of the five ministries of the Army, Navy, Railways, Interior, Commerce and Industry, and Communications. Today, it has been drafted. According to the established procedures, actual tests will be conducted in the three major industrial zones of Northern Kyushu, Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe, and Tokyo. A mobilization meeting will be held in Fukuoka, Kyushu, for four days from the 24th to the 27th. More than 160 people from the military and other departments will attend. The defense of Kyushu, with the Yawata Iron Works as the main focus, will study the following six items: (1) With the ports of Moji and Shimonoseki as the main focus, study the material needs and their supply situation. (2) Study the supply of power such as coal and electricity. (3) Investigate the raw materials required by iron and other factories.

Those who will be responsible for this work are (1) veterans, (2) youth groups, (3) virgin associations, (4) women's associations, (5) juvenile groups, (6) students of all levels of schools, etc. After the implementation in Northern Kyushu, it will gradually be promoted to the Kyoto-Osaka and Tokyo areas.</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo Telegram, 27th: The Japanese government decided today to recommend Kesazuro Mizumachi, a member of the Privy Council and auditor of the Industrial Bank of Japan, as the High Finance Advisor of the "Manchurian Puppet State," and Lieutenant General Kumashichi Tsukushi as the High Military Advisor. It is generally expected that the Japanese government will also recommend Ambassador to Germany Obata or former Foreign Minister Yoshizawa as High Diplomacy Advisor.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency Tokyo Telegram, 27th: It is reported that the Japanese government has decided to promote Mizumachi as the Chairman Advisor. Mizumachi is a Privy Council Advisor, born in Saga Prefecture in 1864. After graduating from the Imperial University, he joined the Japanese Ministry of Finance, serving as Counselor, Secretary, Director of the Financial Bureau, and Vice Minister of Finance. Later, he served as the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, the Director of the Board of Audit, and the Privy Council Advisor during the Hamaguchi Cabinet. He holds a doctorate in law and is currently 69 years old.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency Tokyo Telegram, 27th: Komai Tokuzo, the supreme emperor of the Manchurian Puppet State, is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo within the day. On the surface, it is said that he is going to Japan to discuss the recognition of the puppet state, but in reality, it is to resign from his current position. It is reported that the Japanese government has planned to have Tsuruyoshi Maruyama, the former Superintendent General of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, succeed Komai as the Supreme Emperor. The Japanese have repeatedly stated that the puppet organization was organized by the Manchus, but now they openly appoint officials of the puppet state by the Japanese cabinet. It is unknown what kind of words the Japanese government will use to quibble.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency Tokyo Telegram, 27th: As a result of the Four Heads Political Unification Plan, the leaders of the Japanese troops invading the Northeast will transfer their cadres. A decision will be made after a meeting of the three army chiefs in two or three days. The main list is as follows: General Muto will serve as the Commander of the Kwantung Army and concurrently as the Plenipotentiary Envoy stationed in Manchuria. The current Commander of the Kwantung Army will serve as a Military Councilor. Lieutenant General Koiso Rikusuke is the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. Lieutenant General Yanagisawa will be the Deputy Chief of Staff. The current Chief of Staff Hashimoto will be promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff.</p>
<h3>Japan's Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>Income Far Less Than Expenditure</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo Correspondence, 23rd: A few days ago, Finance Minister Takahashi gave a speech on Japan's financial situation, believing that it is in an unprecedentedly difficult state, because the national income is far less than the necessary expenditure. The government budget for the fiscal year 1932 is 1,780,000,000 yuan, an increase of 280,000,000 yuan compared with the previous year. Tax revenue is 70,000,000 yuan less than the previous year. Postal tax revenue is reduced by 70,000,000 yuan, and state-owned property income is also reduced by 52,000,000 yuan. Takahashi said that austerity has reached its maximum possible limit, and necessary expenditures can no longer be reduced. Moreover, due to the great increase in expenses due to the situation in the three eastern provinces, there are currently no funds available for economic relief. In order to reduce interest rates and facilitate currency circulation, the government has increased the maximum amount of document reserves from 12,000,000 yuan to 1,000,000,000 yuan. However, in order to seek free currency circulation, public trust is absolutely necessary. The people now feel anxious and uneasy, leading to hoarding of existing assets and reluctance to invest lightly. This kind of anxiety must be eliminated before anything can be done. It is generally expected that the official interest rate may have to be reduced again within this month.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Visits U.S. Secretary of State</h3>

It is rumored that Bolivia's army is expected to complete general mobilization on August 6th, and will formally declare war on Paraguay on that day. The entire Bolivian army is currently rushing to the border, and traffic between the two countries has been cut off. According to a telegram from the capital of Paraguay, 10,000 reservists have requested to join the army, and the authorities have agreed to summon them in an emergency.</p>
<h3>Lack of Sincere Disarmament Intentions of France, German General Reorganizes Military</h3>
<p>A Soldier's Duty is to Protect the Homeland</p>
<p>Absolutely Not to be Involved in the Vortex of Politics</p>
<p>Speech by German Army Chief</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 26th - Defense Minister Schleicher today issued a broadcast speech, saying that if neighboring countries do not reduce their armaments, Germany will also repair its armaments to the same level as its neighbors. The main point of Schleicher's speech was the failure of the disarmament conference and the danger of Germany being neighbors with countries with strong armaments. Schleicher accused France of hypocrisy on the issue of disarmament, and said that no one expected other countries to reduce their armaments to the extent of Germany, so Germany had no other choice but to reorganize its armaments.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 26th - German Army Chief General Schleicher gave a speech on the radio tonight, claiming that he did not want to see the declaration of a state of emergency, and even less did he want to see a military dictator government, because using the army as police and involving the army in political vortex, are the two things that soldiers especially oppose. The duty of the army is to protect the country for the nation, and to connect the army with the fate of people from all walks of life for the society, and not to serve any class or special interest. Later, he discussed the military dictatorship system, saying that if the government relies on the bayonets of the army for its life, then this kind of government will quickly disappear and only fail. Therefore, I do not want to see a military dictatorship government, but I hope that Germany will have a government with the three virtues of military courage, decisiveness, and a sense of responsibility in the current very difficult situation. Later, he discussed the status of the German army at the disarmament conference, saying that there were two ways to go. One was for other countries to reduce to the same level as Germany, and the other was to give Germany equal rights to armaments. However, even if the second way is implemented, the German army will not increase, but will only be reorganized so that the country can obtain the necessary security. Some people may object to this for financial reasons, but in addition to guaranteeing the maintenance of a modern and efficient army, the cost will not be much more than that of the army stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<h3>Martial Law Lifted, Election Unlikely to Have Problems</h3>
<p>Disturbances in Berlin Repeatedly</p>
<p>Few Tourists This Year</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 26th - The German martial law has now been abolished. People in general are now focused on the outcome of the elections at the end of July. Chancellor von Papen is now optimistic about the state affairs, saying that he has various reasons to expect that the elections will be conducted safely. Military rule has now been stopped, so administrative power has been restored to the hands of the Berlin police. However, although the state of emergency has been lifted, the punishment of suspending several newspapers for several days has not been cancelled, and the trial of the case against Social Democratic leader Brauer has not been shelved. At night, police clashed with communists, resulting in the death of a woman. A clash between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party in Cologne also resulted in one death and several injuries. There have been repeated disturbances in Berlin, resulting in fewer tourists and affecting trade. In June last year, 24,000 foreigners and 80,000 people from various German states came to Berlin. In June this year, only 12,700 foreigners and 60,000 Germans came to Berlin.</p>
<p>Training Ship Wrecked in Storm</p>
<p>Only One-Third of the Hundred Crew Members Rescued</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 27th - The German Navy training ship Niobe capsized in a storm outside the port of Kiel today. Of the 100 crew members, only 31 were rescued. The whereabouts of the remaining 69 trainees are unknown.</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 27th - A maritime aircraft that flew to the scene of the Niobe training ship accident reported that no crew members were seen. Warships that went to inspect also said that they could not find anything. All the training ship's officers except the captain and first mate drowned at sea. The owner of a cargo ship about half a mile from the scene of the accident told a Reuter interviewer after arriving in Kiel that black clouds surged from the north and a storm suddenly arose. The training ship was right in its path, and the ship capsized in just two or three minutes. Only those on deck were able to be rescued, while those in the ship sank with the ship. The cargo ship immediately went to the rescue and put down two small boats. After four hours, 40 people were rescued and sent to a German cruiser.</p>
<h3>Austrian Cabinet to Resign</h3>
<p>Agrarian Party Dissatisfied with New Loan Agreement</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 26th - The Austrian Dollfuss cabinet will resign within days, because the Austrian Agrarian Party believes that the loan agreement signed by Dollfuss in Geneva is tantamount to binding Austria hand and foot and presenting it to France, expressing deep dissatisfaction and no longer supporting the current cabinet.</p>
<h3>Russian Foreign Policy Unaffected After Signing of Russian-Polish Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>Still Reserving Freedom of Action on Vilnius</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 26th - The government here is often satisfied with the signing of the Russo-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty on Sunday, but said that this move will not affect the Soviet Union's diplomatic policies and specifically stated that the Soviet Union does not, by signing the treaty, regard it as recognizing the western border of Poland and the current Polish occupation of Vilnius. The Russian government still reserves the full right to act freely on these two issues.</p>
<h3>British Imperial Conference Studies Aftermath of Silver Price Problem</h3>
<p>Unlikely to Have Any Results</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 26th - An Imperial Finance Committee was organized in today's Imperial Conference to study the aftermath of the silver price problem. Canadian Minister of Commerce Stevens was elected as the chairman of the committee. Representatives of the Imperial states will be asked to express their opinions on Thursday, and then the issues will be submitted to a subcommittee for separate study. However, according to a representative, the committee may not be able to formulate any great plans, because South Africa is a well-known gold-producing country.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Comment on Chinese Road Administration</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 27th - Archbishop of Canterbury recently traveled to China to investigate the flood situation. After returning, he published many papers in the London Times, strongly criticizing the poor condition of transportation in China, which has aroused great attention from the general public to the internal difficulties of China. The Times published an editorial, saying that better roads cannot quell the ambitions of warlords and bandits, and that convenient transportation will only increase their arrogance. Only roads can help disaster relief, and to avoid famine, river channels should be dredged on a large scale. The newspaper also said that this is not to say that road construction is useless, but that only road construction is not enough to alleviate the plight of farmers. This will have to wait until China can build a stable and responsible government, and then the burden on its farmers can be slightly eased.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices in Guangzhou: During this time when the communist bandits took advantage of the various armies entering Jiangxi to jointly suppress them, they actually attacked Nanxiong with more than 70,000 troops on the 12th, hoping to seize Guangzhou as a base to harm the country. The ferocity of their momentum was unprecedented. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers and generals fought valiantly and effectively suppressed the enemy. Therefore, with only two divisions, they fought for three days and nights, engaged in more than 20 hand-to-hand battles, killing more than 6,000 bandits, capturing more than 1,000, and seizing more than 1,000 guns. The main force of the bandits was destroyed incompletely, and the remaining troops were scattered. The armies of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian are chasing and attacking along various routes, striving to achieve complete suppression. At this time of national crisis, with the country's survival hanging by a thread, we deeply believe that unless the communist bandits are exterminated, national defense cannot be consolidated, and unless the rebels are conquered, neighboring invaders cannot be resisted. The armies of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian have already taken on the task of suppressing the communists, and the central government can be relieved of its worries in the south. We only hope to put into practice the words of long-term resistance, quickly send a large army out of the pass to conquer the rebels, and recover lost territory. We especially hope that compatriots across the country will recognize that resisting Japan, suppressing the communists, and conquering the rebels are the only way for the nation to survive. Do not mistakenly think that suppressing the communists is internal strife, and do not mistakenly think that conquering the rebels will cause foreign troubles, leading the country into eternal damnation. We are fortunate, fortunate! The Southwest Executive Department of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, You.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Finances After the September 18th Incident (Continued)</h3>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence, Huai Ren</p>
<p>The large-scale issuance of public bonds is indeed a crux that the current Japanese finances cannot avoid. Although it is said that making up for financial deficiencies is not limited to the issuance of public bonds, under the joint cabinet of the military, they are extremely unwilling to implement tax increase policies that will have an immediate reaction. As a result, they cannot help but go down the path of debt. Indeed, the people of Japan are currently unable to endure further tax increases. For the sake of showing consideration for the people, the government is implementing the upper strategy of raising debts to ease social sentiment. However, this is also an unbelievable contradiction. How can people who cannot endure tax increases subscribe to such a huge amount of public bonds? According to the Minister of Finance, most of these public bonds will be subscribed by the Bank of Japan. At first glance, it seems that the issuance of public bonds no longer has any direct relationship with the people. However, the reality is not that simple.</p>
<p>As a result of most of the public bonds being borne by the Bank of Japan, currency will inevitably be issued in increased amounts for the Manchurian Incident expenses, deficit compensation, and unemployment projects. Needless to say, this will cause a currency inflation effect. The small portion of public bonds that are not borne by the Bank of Japan will generally be subscribed by the Deposit Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. Although the Deposit Bureau's subscription does not actively inflate the currency, in fact, when the Deposit Bureau bears the public bonds, it will inevitably issue its dead savings for turnover, which may actually passively promote currency inflation.</p>
<p>As a result of currency inflation, the price of currency will tend to plummet, and the relative price of goods will gradually tend to rise. According to the principles of the business cycle, it will inevitably be able to arouse temporary industrial investment. However, in today's era of lurking global economic crisis, this is easier said than done. Therefore, the recent result of Japan's currency inflation and rising prices not only cannot arouse the heat of industry, but will make the real wages of workers increasingly lower, and the property of those living on interest, small shopkeepers, and farmers will be invisibly and secretly requisitioned, eventually causing the middle class to rapidly fall into the proletariat, forming a clear struggle between the propertied and the propertyless, and building a new situation for Japan's future.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, a year has passed suddenly. Whether Japan can long-term and safely occupy my three northeastern provinces and carry out the annexation of Manchuria and Mongolia in name and reality depends entirely on the extent of our country's efforts in the future and the attitude of international opinion. However, the financial cracks that Japan has suffered as a result of September 18th and the terror in the future have already been placed before our eyes. This may give us a little comfort after extreme sorrow. However, it is absolutely not allowed for us to be optimistic because of this. (End)</p>
<h3>The East Railway Eight Stations Issue that Triggered the Deterioration Between Japan and Russia</h3>
<p>Russian Consul Lodges Strong Protest to the Puppet Diplomatic Office Shenyang Correspondence: The recent deterioration of relations between Japan and Russia was triggered by the Jiangyun Office of Puppet Harbin taking over the Jiangbin Wharf of the East Railway Eight Stations. At present, its negotiation industry has stopped. At the beginning of the incident, the Russian consul in Harbin had protested and sent it to the Puppet Harbin Diplomatic Office. Although this matter has been going on for many days, since it has caused a serious escalation of relations between Japan and Russia, it is not without a look at its value. The text is as follows: "This Consul General urges your Special Envoy to pay attention to the fact that the Northeast Jiangfang Fleet Headquarters is interfering irresponsibly and illegally with the Harbin Commercial Office Wharf Transportation Office of the Chinese Eastern Railway. This is destroying the Chinese Eastern Railway and the economic organization of the Soviet Union, and causing the eight stations soybeans to be unable to load and unload for a long time, causing significant losses. At the same time, regarding the illegal behavior of the headquarters, the Deputy Director Li Shaogeng and Deputy Chairman Kuzneitsov have jointly urged the Administrative Officer of the Special District, Zhang Jinghui, to pay attention. When meeting with this Consul General, they promised that the Manchurian government would take appropriate measures to avoid infringing on the rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, the Northeast Jiangfang Fleet Headquarters and the Chinese Eastern Railway Commercial Office are interfering illegally with the affairs of the Commercial Office under the pretext of not renewing the contract, and engaging in irresponsible behavior, such as prohibiting the transportation affairs of the Commercial Office, detaining the wharf staff of the agency, or even detaining the wharf director, and destroying the keys, etc. According to the records of the wharf takeover and the general principles of the actions of the staff of the Northeast Jiangfang Fleet Headquarters, the above facts have been proven, and the rights and interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway have been significantly damaged. This is a serious protest to the Manchurian government. The Manchurian government must bear full responsibility for the damage caused to the economic organization of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Soviet Union. This Consul General hopes that your Special Envoy will quickly stop the Northeast Jiangfang Fleet Headquarters from interfering with the wharf office of the Chinese Eastern Railway, fully restore the wharf rights, and take action against the Northeast Jiangfang Fleet staff's future insults and coercion against the Harbin Commercial Office staff, and within the scope of possibility, quickly request your government to respond quickly. Moreover, the Commercial Office has always stated verbally or in writing that it hopes to renew the contract. Especially according to the past and present contracts, the Northeast Jiangfang Fleet Headquarters has no right to the transportation affairs of the Commercial Office and the wharf (the property of the Chinese Eastern Railway). Soviet Consul General to Harbin, Slavutsky."</p>
<h3>Corruption of Japanese Personnel in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Two Japanese Advisors Guilty of Corruption and Illegal Activities</p>
<p>Opinions Differ Among Various Departments and Agencies</p>
<p>Politics Entirely Controlled by the Military</p>
<p>Even Law-Abiding Japanese People are Concerned</p>
<p>Suifenhe Correspondence: Japanese people often boast that they are united from top to bottom and consistent with the outside world. What the reporter has heard and witnessed here has proved that their statement is inaccurate. Although the Japanese ambition to annex the Northeast is fierce, it is actually divided into two factions: the rapid progress faction and the gradual progress faction. Even in terms of the Japanese people in the Northeast, those belonging to the Honjo Shigeru system of the Kwantung Army and the wandering people who have lived in the Northeast for many years belong to the rapid progress faction. Those belonging to the consulates and the Manchu Railway and cultural organizations advocate truly supporting the independence of the puppet country and Japan avoiding the name and residing in reality, secretly planning or manipulating it. This faction is the gradual progress faction, and the two factions are fighting fiercely in secret. However, because the military holds power, the current situation in the Northeast is completely controlled by the rapid progress faction. The gradual progress faction has retreated to a passive position due to the failure of its proposals. Therefore, in the puppet agencies, advisors, and consultants in various places in the Northeast, no Japanese gentleman has ever participated. Many Japanese people who have lived in Harbin and Heihe for many years and have always had a reputation have buried themselves in their original work and do not dare to climb high. There are actually quite a few people of this kind. A certain scholar once told the reporter that the current approach in Manchukuo is very bad, which only provokes the antipathy of the Chinese people. As a result, seeking speed is not achieved, and there is also fear of debt. There are more and more unemployed people in various places, production is declining, and food for the people this year is worrying, and security next year will be even more difficult to maintain. This kind of strategy is misled by ordinary soldiers. We have lived here for a long time and have not benefited from it. I am afraid that we will soon be affected by the economic downturn and may even go bankrupt and become unemployed. His words are quite representative of the opinions of some Japanese people here. It is a pity that the Japanese warlords are rampant and unscrupulous and do not know that the psychology of their own people is contrary to them. After the Kwantung Army of Japan took control of the life of the three northeastern provinces, wandering people from all over rose up to engage in activities, and even peddlers and pawns became consultants to the puppet state agencies. They forgot their original faces when they ascended to the sky in one step and were greedy and perverted the law without any scruples. For example, Horii, the advisor of the Harbour Ship Administration Bureau in Harbin, made a fortune of more than 100,000 in less than three months in office. The source of this wealth was the permission to build commercial ships. There has always been a surplus of Songhua River ships. The previous Shipping Administration Bureau had a limit of five ships to be built per year, but now Horii has lifted the ban. Anyone who has a movement to this end can build ships. As a result, more than a dozen commercial ships have been added to the Songhua River this year. Recently, the incident occurred and was captured by the Kwantung Army and will be punished. This is one example. The Puppet East Railway Guard Army Headquarters hired an advisor named Imai. This person was a retired soldier in his hometown. His original position was only a sergeant (i.e., subaltern). After being appointed as an advisor, he wore a lieutenant colonel's uniform and swaggered in the city, openly soliciting bribes and selling vacancies. He also had an opium addiction and would lie on a couch in the Chinese opium den every day. After he had enjoyed himself, he would brush off his clothes and leave without paying a penny. Recently, his special agency reported it to the military, and he was dismissed and investigated. A man named Ono was sent to take over. Imai occupied the official residence and refused to leave, and he was still guarded by four soldiers of the Guard Army when he went in and out. Ono was also a wandering man. Seeing that Imai was still claiming to be an advisor, he led four or five Koreans and went to look for him with whips. After they met, the two told each other about their dispatch. Their words were not in agreement, and they even fought each other. After all, Ono had more people, and Imai was whipped many times and staggered away. After going out, he still pointed his finger and scolded loudly, saying that he would not be able to report his grievances. This is another matter. From these two incidents, it can be seen that the Japanese occupation of the Northeast has never had a unified plan of organization. However, a group of wandering people and warlords stare wide-eyed every day, clench their fists, and act like tigers to the Chinese people. The Chinese people are subdued by their lewd power and submit their heads and listen to others. Again, in terms of the Japanese agencies in northern Manchuria, the opinions of the special agency, the military police, and the consulates are very different. Often, the military police are unaware of the affairs handled by the special agency and still interfere with them. The consulates are unaware of the affairs handled by the military police and handle them directly. The same is true for each division. The opinions between each individual are also deep. If puppet officials belong to the A agency system, the B agency must think of a way to restrict them. If they belong to the C and D agencies, the A and B agencies think of a way to remove them. Therefore, people say that the Japanese are consistent with the outside world, but it is not seen. What they can achieve, according to the reporter's observation, is only to despise the Chinese people and have no good feelings. Everyone thinks of the matter of slavery. (21st)</p>
<h3>The Recovery of Qianjiang by the Suppression Army</h3>
<p>Bandits Occupy Qianjiang for Seven Days and Loot More Than 100,000 Worth of Property</p>
<p>Liu and Huang Brigades Recover the County Seat and Kill Countless Bandits</p>
<p>The Kong Bandits, Numbering More Than 10,000, Plan to Capture Puchi</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: In recent months, the red bandits in Hubei Province have been struggling even harder due to the efforts of the army to suppress them. At the same time, in order to cut off communication and facilitate long-term resistance against the officers and soldiers, they have been actively communicating with various routes and forming mutual flanks. On the one hand, they are destroying transportation, so that the officers and soldiers cannot move quickly. The He section in central Hubei and western Hubei, the Kuang Xu section in eastern Hubei and northern Hubei, and the Kong Shen section in southern Hubei have all been launched simultaneously. The Yuan Duan is responsible for communicating with the Xiang River, the Kuang Bandits are responsible for destroying the Pinghan Road and the central Yangtze River, and the Kong Bandits are responsible for destroying the Xiang-E Road. Fortunately, General Commander Chiang is stationed in Hankou, the number of bandit suppression troops has increased, and the mobilization has been rapid, so the bandits' plans have not succeeded and they have suffered heavy losses. According to investigations, the He Duan bandits originally had the pseudo 7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd divisions, together with the pseudo special agents and replenishment departments, totaling about four divisions, using Qianjiang, Tianmen, Jingshan, and Mianyang as their nests. Last month, the 10th Army troops joined forces with the Sichuan Army, Wang Lingji, and Fan Shaozeng, two divisions, to launch a general attack, and successively recovered Zaoshi and Qianjiang, killing countless bandits. It was not long before Qianjiang was lost again and Zaoshi was besieged again. On the 15th of this month, the armies launched a second general attack. Xu Yuanquan, Zhang Zhenhan, Xiao Zhichu, Wan Yaohuang, Liu Peixu, and others were all directing on the front line. On the 22nd, Xiao's division defeated the bandits attacking Zaoshi. On the 24th, Zhang's division and Liu Peixu's brigade captured Qianjiang County. At the same time, important bandit nests such as Diaochahu and Zhangjiegang were all cleared. Currently, He Chengjun and Xu Yuanquan are supervising the suppression of the remnants of the bandits on one side and rushing to handle local relief work on the other. As for the course of the battle, Xu, Zhang, and Xiao all sent telegrams to Hankou to report. Xu's telegram stated: "My Liu Peixu and Huang Xin brigades launched a general attack on Qianjiang on the morning of the 24th. After six hours of bloody hand-to-hand combat and more than a dozen charges, the city was completely recovered at noon, killing countless bandits and capturing prisoners everywhere. In addition to ordering active local relief work, we are also sending teams to follow up and pursue in order to completely clear the area." Zhang's telegram stated: "At dawn on the 24th, Huang Xin's brigade attacked Qianjiang. It was reported that they occupied the area at noon on the same day. The bandits fled towards X溝, and our cavalry is still pursuing." Xiao's telegram stated: "On the morning of the 22nd, our army launched an attack from Tianmen on the pseudo 7th and 8th divisions of the bandits who attacked my Zaoshi. At the same time, Yu Zhaolong's brigade also dispatched troops to attack. Seeing the large army suppressing them, the bandits fled west in a panic. My 10th brigade took the opportunity to pursue them, killing many bandits and capturing more than 20 guns. The bandits planned to retreat to the Qianjiachang and Wamiaoji areas. My army has followed up and suppressed them in the Qipomiao, Wuyanling, Wamiaoji, Tailimiao, and Yangjiachang battles, capturing a large number of bandits, machine guns, mortars, automatic rifles, carbines, and pistols, and mules and horses were seized. We also obtained the seal of the pseudo 9th division. Earlier, the He bandits' pseudo 7th and 9th divisions besieged Jingshan. My Xu group fought alone for 14 days and nights, and the bandits could not succeed. Later, in Qipomiao and Wuyanling, we inflicted heavy damage on the pseudo 7th division. We crushed the pseudo 8th division in Wamiaoji and Tailimiao, and again destroyed the pseudo 9th division, which had fled back from Qianjiang, in Yangjiachang. Countless people drowned. Duan bandits fled west in a panic. On the 20th, we pursued the bandits to Zhangjiegang. Hearing that the He bandits led the remnants of the pseudo 7th division to Zaoshi, we turned back to aid them. On the 22nd, we arrived in Zaoshi, and the bandits fled west again. In this battle, which lasted eight days, we chased for more than 300 li, and fought more than ten battles of various sizes, killing a large number of bandits and capturing more than 300 people alive, capturing more than ten machine guns, mortars, automatic rifles, and light machine guns, more than 300 carbines and pistols, more than 200 mules and horses, the seal of the pseudo 9th division, and dozens of flags, and destroying more than a dozen pseudo county governments." It is also heard that Qianjiang was lost for the second time on the early morning of the 18th of this month. About 5,000 He bandits entered the city, carrying out arson and looting, killing people like hemp, looting more than 100,000 yuan of property, and kidnapping more than 500 old and young men and women before retreating. Although they were released near Shayang, many died on the road, and the disaster was repeated, which is also pitiful.</p>
<p>In southern Hubei, the Kong bandits, led by He Chong, disturbed Guanbuqiao on the Wu-Chang Road on the 15th, and traffic was cut off for four days. On the 19th, it was restored to its original state. According to a recent telegram from Huang Yulin, the county magistrate of Puchi, to the Provincial Government and the Civil Affairs Department, the text said: "The red bandits who disturbed Guanbuqiao on the Wu-Chang Road are from the Kong He Chong Department, with about 10,000 people and more than 2,000 guns. It is rumored that the 85th Division stationed in Tongshan was robbed of more than 200 guns, and the 82nd Division stationed in Guanbuqiao was also robbed of 400 rifles, 4 machine guns, and 2 mortars. I don't know if this is true. The garrison in this county, in addition to telegraphically ordering Xie's battalion stationed in Tingsiqiao to rush to Xianning, also transferred Wu's battalion stationed in Shiqikeng and Long's battalion stationed in the county seat to reinforce the front. The bandits fled when they heard the news. My Xie's and Wu's battalions returned to their original defenses. It is now heard that more than 10,000 bandits with 400-500 guns have recently been discovered in Shushigang and Maishi in Tongcheng County, led by Shen Bandit Guozhen, who are currently in a stalemate with the Tongcheng Corps. According to recent confirmed reports, the National Army has recently obtained secret documents from the red bandits, whose plan is to break through Puchi and connect with the bandits north of the Yangtze River. Now the Kong and Shen bandits are very much imitating Puchi's example. The county magistrate has already consulted with the garrison to block the passes. Tingsiqiao and Shiqikeng Ferry have completed extremely strong defensive fortifications. All the corps in this county are divided into defenses in Longkeng, Xiaobai, Xindian, Chebu, and Wanguchang, supervising the brave teams and allocating defenses." (July 26th)</p>
<h3>The Fujian Pacification Headquarters Controls the Various Troops Stationed in Fujian</h3>
<p>Cai Tingkai Supervises Troops in Zhangzhou to Suppress Communists</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Jiang Guangnai, the Director of the Fujian Pacification Headquarters, has requested sick leave, which has been approved by the Military Affairs Commission. Cai Tingkai, the Commander of the 19th Route Army, will act on his behalf. Because Cai himself is commanding the suppression of communists in Zhangzhou, he has appointed Deng Shizeng, the Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters, to act on his behalf in all matters. Deng arrived in the province on the 16th aboard the Chu Tai warship from Xiamen. He took office on the 17th and announced the appointments of Fan Zongchi as the Director of the General Staff Office, Wu Dian as the Director of the Adjutant Office, and Mao Wenjun as the Director of the Transportation Office on the 18th. A secretariat will not be established. The candidates for the directors of the Military Law and Military Ordnance Offices have not yet been determined. On the 19th, a circular telegram was sent to all unit commanders in the province, informing them that all National Defense Ministry troops would be under the command of the Pacification Headquarters. They were also ordered to submit reports detailing the names and numbers of officers and soldiers, the amount of military equipment and supplies, and the locations where the troops were stationed. On the 20th, a telegram was sent summoning the commanders of various divisions and brigades stationed in the rear areas of northern and eastern Fujian to the provincial capital for a military conference to discuss concrete plans for pacifying the entire province. Liu Heding, the commander of the 56th Division stationed in Yanping, arrived in the provincial capital from Yanping on the 21st after receiving the telegram. He reported to the Pacification Headquarters and the provincial government on the situation regarding the suppression of communist bandits in Chong'an and Pucheng counties on the Fujian border, as well as the local bandits in Yanxi, Gutian, and Minqing counties. He also reported on the conflict between Lu Xingbang's and Ma Hongxing's troops in Guihua, where Ma's brigade was besieged in the city. Lu's division used artillery to bombard the city, causing widespread destruction of civilian housing. Furthermore, the communist bandits in western Fujian took advantage of this opportunity to send troops from Changting, capturing Ninghua and advancing towards Qingliu, creating a very urgent situation. He requested that immediate measures be taken to stop them. On the 22nd, the Pacification Headquarters telegraphed Yong'an, ordering Lu Xingbang to cease the attack pending investigation and resolution. It is unknown whether Lu's troops will comply. Regarding the suppression of bandits in western Fujian, after Cai Tingkai arrived in Zhangzhou from Xiamen, he ordered Zhang Zhen's 49th Division to advance from Nan'jing towards Longyan, Shen Guanghan's 61st Division to advance from Zhangzhou towards Nan'jing, and Qu Shounian's 78th Division to advance from Haicheng towards Zhangzhou. It was decided that Zhang's and Shen's divisions would take the front lines, and Qu's division would secure the rear. The plan is to first recover Longyan, then plan to attack the communist bandits' stronghold in Tingzhou on the Fujian-Jiangxi border. Currently, Zhang's division has advanced to Shizhong in Longyan, and Shen's division has advanced to Hexi in Nan'jing, close to the bandit lines. A major battle is expected to occur soon. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Labor Strike at the Zhongxing Coal Mine in Zaozhuang</h3>
<p>53 Trouble Makers Arrested</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the strike of external laborers at the Zhongxing Coal Mine in Zaozhuang, Han Fuju, the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, sent Wang Jun, along with Gu Xianglin, the Chief of the Industry and Commerce Section of the Department of Industry, to Zaozhuang to investigate the cause of the strike and persuade the workers to resume work. After Wang and Gu arrived in Zaozhuang, they found thousands of workers gathered for a meeting. They gently advised them to resume work first, promising to find a solution to the profit-sharing problem. Most of the workers were willing to resume work, but trouble makers prevented them from doing so. Gu realized that communist elements were secretly instigating and inciting the workers. He then requested and received permission from the provincial government to send Kong Xiangsheng's regiment to suppress the unrest and prevent any unexpected events. Fifty-three trouble makers were arrested and imprisoned in the Yixian County government. A secret investigation is underway to identify and arrest the communist elements who initiated the labor strike and incited the workers, with the aim of imprisoning them. Regarding the resumption of work, Gu discussed and agreed with the company on a temporary solution: to issue bonuses. (Although the external laborers are contracted, the bonuses can be issued based on their performance, such as giving bonuses for exceeding the quota of coal mined, as an incentive. For example, if the original quota was 100 catties of coal per day for one yuan, if someone mines 110 catties in one day, which exceeds the quota by 10%, they will be given a bonus of 10 cents.) The company's bonus plan was also announced publicly. As a result, the workers gradually resumed work, and the labor strike has been resolved.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders Suspension of Jiangsheng Daily</h3>
<p>And Summons Manager Liu Yusheng for Interrogation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 26th, the Jiangsu Provincial Government secretly ordered the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital to summon Liu Yusheng, the director of the Jiangsheng Daily, for interrogation and to order the newspaper to cease publication. After receiving the order, the Public Security Bureau dispatched Captain Shao Hanzhang of the Criminal Investigation Unit, along with detectives in cars, at around 1:00 PM, arresting Liu at Helin Temple and detaining him in the Public Security Bureau's VIP room. Simultaneously, police were sent to guard the newspaper office. The Provincial Government specifically held a meeting with reporters from various newspapers in the provincial capital and reporters stationed in the town by newspapers from other places at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. The Secretary-General chaired the meeting, with Councilor Tang present. The chairman reported the details of the incident, stating that the content in the "Iron Plow" and "Cry" supplements of the newspaper contained inappropriate words, and after consideration, the bureau was ordered to summon him for interrogation and order a suspension of publication. The matter is very simple, expressing this as an unfortunate incident. The reporters requested three points: 1. Clearly indicate the inappropriate content of the newspaper supplements. 2. Allow Liu Yusheng to be released on bail through proper procedures. 3. Hope that the Provincial Government, with its usual care for the public opinion of the provincial capital, will handle this case leniently. The Secretary-General agreed to forward this to Chairman Gu and promised a reply at 2:00 PM on the 27th.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Dispatch Personnel to Supervise Collection of Local Expenses: The County Education Bureau previously suffered from the Songjiang Bank's failure to repay its educational funds, affecting the revenue and expenditure of this year's educational expenses, making it difficult to sustain. The First and Second National Tax Collection Offices have a substantial debt in collecting educational funds on behalf. It was resolved at the county administrative meeting that the Education Bureau should jointly dispatch personnel with local agencies to supervise the collection. The Education Bureau convened a meeting and drafted supervisory measures, requesting relevant agencies to dispatch personnel and implement them on a regular basis. It is now learned that the First District Office has appointed Ding Shixi and Zhang Lian to undertake the task and has sent a letter of reply to the Education Bureau for verification.</p>
<p>County Security Council to Hold Regular Meetings: Qiu Mingjiu, a supervisor of the Provincial Committee's Security Corps, has been inspecting various districts in recent days and will soon complete the task. He will convene a joint meeting of all county and district corps chiefs on the 29th to solicit</p>
<p>opinions on the organization of security corps in each district and to provide guidance on the direction of progress.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Budget Shortfall Leads to Change from Bureau to Section: This county has suffered consecutive years of famine, with barren land and impoverished people, causing the agricultural sector to face difficulties and all endeavors to be abandoned. Although the budget of each agency has been reduced repeatedly, it is still difficult to make ends meet. Recently, a portion of the land tax in the war zone has been ordered to be exempted, further reducing local revenue. Government expenditure should be further tightened to supplement resources. Gu Zhonghan, the head of the First District, Qian Jinpan, the head of the Second District, and Huang Baolin, the head of the Fourth District, specifically submitted a proposal to the first county administrative meeting of the 21st, recommending that the county's Education, Finance, Public Security, and Construction Bureaus be changed to specialized sections attached to the county government, to be handled by the county magistrate. The proposal has been approved and submitted to the province for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Wuxi Prisoners Transferred to Taicang: The county prison and detention center in this county holds more than one hundred male and female prisoners who have been sentenced or are awaiting trial. In March of this year, all of them escaped, and none have been captured since. Recently, due to the hot weather and overcrowding in the Wuxi County Prison, inmates have been dying from infectious diseases daily. Chen Chuande, the county magistrate of Wuxi, considering this, specifically sent a letter to the county government of this county to discuss transferring a portion of the prisoners to Taicang to avoid the spread of infection. He has already sent officers to escort forty prisoners to Taicang, where they were received by prison officer Xia Xueqin for verification.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Bandits Extort Doctor: Wang Weibai, a doctor residing on South Street, received a threatening letter from bandits a few days ago. The letter stated that they had been in Kunshan for more than ten days and were aware that the doctor was highly regarded by patients. Therefore, they would not make unreasonable demands, but requested a loan of 300 yuan to be placed near the electric pole at the door at 12:00 PM on the 25th, wrapped in red paper and marked with a straw sandal. They would send someone to collect it. If the authorities were notified, they would take appropriate measures. After receiving the letter, Wang reported it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Qin Jieren, the Director of the Bureau, dispatched patrol leader Wang Ronghe with two armed patrol officers to ambush the area. At 12:30 AM on the 26th, Xu Xiangqu, a native of the city and former head of the Songjiang Tinglin Public Security Sub-bureau, passed by the location with a flashlight and noticed the paper package. As he bent down to pick it up, he was apprehended by Wang and the patrol officers, taken to the bureau, and detained. At 7:00 PM, after an interrogation by Section Chief Xia, Xu denied any involvement in the incident. Section Chief Xia, based on the statement, suspected that the case involved extortion and ordered him to be remanded in custody. On the 27th, he was sent to the county government for trial. The incident has attracted much attention throughout the city. Wei Wenyuan, the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and Min Caichen, a doctor specializing in trauma, explained to Director Qin that Xu's behavior and reputation were generally good. However, as the principal offender had not been apprehended, it was feared that Xu would have difficulty being released temporarily.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Four Bandits Captured Outside Panmen: Four bandits who robbed the Shi family in Xinguoli, a village in Suzhou, and the family of a certain person at the Golden Lion Bridge were hiding behind the Su Lun Yarn Factory outside Panmen. Yesterday, detectives Xu Songlin and others from the Detective Team captured the male and female bandits Wu Da, Wu Zhang, and others. After being taken to the team, they confessed without denial and were immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau and the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Bandit Suppression Department Welcomes the Extraction of the Ring Leader in the Robbery Case: Shen, the commander of the Suzhou-Songjiang Bandit Suppression Headquarters, received a secret report that Wang Yucheng (aka Shi Changqing), the ring leader in the robbery of the Huzhou Banxiao</p>
<p>boat and other cases, was hiding on the Guangxing Ma Neck boat in Yangshupu, Shanghai. He dispatched Detective Xu Fengshan to Shanghai for arrest. Detective Xu, together with Chinese and Western detectives, went to arrest Wang Yucheng, Zhou Menglin, Zhou Bailin, Cui Desheng, Tang Mingzhou, Yang Zhengqing, Sun Youzhong, Tang Youlin, Wu Zhusan, and other nine people, and sent them to the Shanghai court for temporary detention. On the 26th, the Bandit Suppression Command prepared a document and sent personnel to Shanghai to welcome and extract them to Suzhou for trial.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Orders Retrial of the Case of a Criminal Shooting Police Officers: Zhang Zhikun and Wu Yumei, two criminals who shot and killed three police officers, including Zhao Wei, at the Longquan Building outside the West Gate of Wuyi, have been captured and approved by the provincial government for execution by shooting. There is another accomplice named Yang Yan. The county government received an order from the provincial government to retry the criminal and report the results. On the 26th, Wu Zishi, the secretary of the county government, conducted a retrial in court. Once the facts are clear, they will be submitted to the province for review and approval.</p>
<p>Another Change of Principal at Changzhou Provincial High School: Zhu Lu, the principal of Changzhou Provincial High School, was previously requested by the county representatives' conference to be removed by the province. Subsequently, Zhu also knew that it was difficult to stay and resigned. The Department of Education separately appointed Wang Zhongqi to take over. Recently, Wang submitted his resignation due to other engagements. Recently, the Department of Education also appointed Shao Heting to come to Changzhou to take over. However, the school has been suspended for many days, and matters such as student enrollment and other proceedings for the next semester urgently need to be handled.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Communist Criminal Escapes from Prison: Zhu Xilin, a communist criminal from Taixing, was sent by the Provincial Security Department to the Danyang Detention Center for temporary detention. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, Zhu suddenly escaped from the prison by climbing over the wall. By the time the prison guards realized it, he had disappeared without a trace. Yu Xinbo, the guard on duty, also fled for fear of punishment. Prison guards are now searching everywhere for him. The guard has been arrested in Zhenjiang. Whether there is a suspicion of releasing the prisoner is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Epidemic Outbreak in Urban and Rural Areas: The weather has been extremely hot in recent days, and an epidemic is raging in the city. More than one hundred people have died one after another. The county government, the Public Security Bureau, and the Relief Institute are preparing to establish a summer epidemic prevention center and have considerable equipment for preventive measures. It is now reported that a cholera epidemic has occurred in Baziqiao and Muqiao in the 12th district of the northern countryside. More than 30 people have died in a few days. For prevention purposes, the people in the township are required to bury the dead on the same day without allowing them to hold funerals and stay to prevent the spread of the epidemic.</p>

<p>Planning a Large-Scale Domestic Goods Market: Lu Xiaobo, Yu Xiaochuan, Wu Tixian, Zhou Zigeng, Yang Guangyu, Hu Xiwu, Huang Bofu, Liu Zhuyun, and others in this port, considering that the provincial capital is flooded with foreign goods and lacks a proper domestic goods market, plan to raise funds to survey locations and build a large-scale domestic goods market. This is currently in progress.</p>
<p>The Beijing-Tangshan Road has been Completed: The realignment project of the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway's Beijing-Tangshan section was originally scheduled for completion by the end of June. However, due to rainfall on 31 days in April, May, and June, work could not be carried out and had to be extended to early August. However, the Jiangsu Construction Department considered the project extremely important and could not be delayed any further. It strictly ordered Director Yu of the Engineering Office to supervise the contractors to rush the construction day and night. According to a telegram report from Director Yu of the Engineering Office to the department, the various projects in the Beijing-Tangshan section have been completed successively. The contractors completed the work a few days or more than ten days ahead of schedule, in accordance with the contract's provisions for extending the completion date due to rainy days.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Autumn Harvest in a Drought: This year's summer has been especially dry, with the scorching sun shining for more than twenty days without a drop of rain. As a result, the crops in the Jiangbei area are withering badly. If it does not rain again, not only will the mountain</p>
<p>fields be hopeless, but even the polder fields will yield nothing.</p>
<p>Shareholder Turmoil at Yutong Company: At the previous shareholders' meeting of Yutong Salt Company on Zuowei Street, Yangzhou, after the election of new directors, shareholder Fang claimed that the consolidation of shares and the sudden influx of new shareholders supporting the election of new directors was unfair. He hired lawyer Huang Qi to apply to the county court for mediation and declare the election invalid. The court hearing was on the 24th, but the opposing party, Chen Xiangchen, did not appear. Lawyer Huang requested that the mediation be declared invalid so that a formal lawsuit could be filed. In addition, Fang has learned that the company's capital has suffered losses, with debts exceeding four times the capital. He has separately submitted reports to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Salt Affairs Administration, and the Huaiyun Administration, requesting that they order an increase in capital or declare liquidation to avoid affecting commercial finance and damaging shareholders' rights. Once approval is obtained, a special shareholders' meeting will be convened to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Cholera Epidemic and Drought Leading to Famine: The cholera epidemic in Jiangdu has been detailed in previous reports and is even more severe in the past two days. On the 24th, 26 people in this city died from the epidemic, mostly poor young adults. From early morning to noon on the 25th, five people had died in one corner of the old city. Agricultural products are suffering from drought. If it does not rain again in ten days, the Xishan area will face famine again.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Change of County Court President: Cai Yang, the president of the Nantong County Court, returned to his ancestral home in Hunan due to the death of his father. Long Shiliang, a judge, was temporarily appointed to act as president. Cai also firmly resigned to the High Court, which has been approved. Chen Xianwen has been separately appointed to come to Tong to take over.</p>
<p>Joint Defense Zone Investigating Bandits and Communists: Due to the unrest of bandits and communists in Tong, Ru, Hai, and Taiqi, the joint defense zone is arresting escaped bandits and communists. In Yidong District, more than 160 people are on the wanted list. Among them, those who have been mistakenly implicated have submitted applications to the district headquarters for exoneration. The district director has convened a meeting to publicly resolve the change in handling. Those who are wanted are required to report to the</p>
<p>district security corps for investigation within two weeks. If they have been implicated, they are allowed to be released on bail. If they fail to come within the deadline, they will still be strictly pursued.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Allocates Emergency Military Certificates: The county government received a joint order from the Department of Finance and Construction yesterday, stating that the provincial government has decided to issue 600,000 yuan in Emergency Military Certificates to the entire province of Jiangsu to fund urgent construction projects. The amount allocated to Gaoyou has been reviewed and approved at 6,210 yuan, which should be promptly prepared and reported. The Jiangbei Canal Project Aftermath Committee has sent Commissioner Liu to the post to deliver the certificates to the county government. It is heard that County Magistrate Li will convene a meeting of various agencies and district chiefs to discuss the allocation method.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>Epidemic Spreads, Many Deaths: In recent days, the epidemic has been spreading in Haimen County, with several deaths occurring daily. Yang Shao'an, a reporter for the Dagong Daily, also died from the epidemic the day before yesterday. The newspaper has temporarily ceased publication because of this. Yesterday (the 25th), another eleven people died in the county, and the city statistics show that seventy to eighty people have died in the past ten days. Businesses throughout the county and the city have widely hung white paper flags, praying for rain. Many townships have banned slaughtering and selling fish, meat, shrimp, and crabs. If it does not rain again, not only will cotton, beans, and corn wither and die, but the epidemic may spread further.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Meeting on Rice Loans in the First District: The Rice Loan Branch of the Poor Peasants in the First District of Jiaxing was established a few days ago by the district chief Mei Shoren convening a meeting of the township and town heads. Mei Shoren, Zhu Lisān, and Mei Jinjiang were nominated as standing committee members. It was also resolved that (1) the poor peasants will be reported by the township and town heads in conjunction with the neighborhood chiefs, to be completed within one week; (2) the rice loans will be processed completely within two weeks; (3) the quantity of rice loaned will be prescribed as follows: (A) regardless of the number of mouths, those with three or fewer people will borrow two dou and five sheng; (B) those with five</p>

<p>Investigating and Prohibiting Gambling at Nanhu: Nanhu Lake in Jiaxing is a scenic spot in Hezhong. During the summer season, painted boats gather like clouds. However, singing, choosing beauties, and gambling have always been strictly prohibited. This year is different. The sound of mahjong and singing continues day and night, and the water and land police do not interfere. Yesterday, the County Executive Committee resolved to send a letter to the water and land police to strictly investigate and prohibit gambling at Nanhu.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Director of the Civil Affairs Department to Inspect Ningbo: Lu Bichou, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province, set off from the province a few days ago to inspect various places in Wenzhou and Taizhou.

<h3>Fuyang</h3>
<p>Accident Involving Qianjiang and Dahua Ships: On the 22nd, the Qianjiang and Dahua Shipping Companies' Jiangkai passenger ships departed from Tong. The Hengxing ship of the Qianjiang Company arrived in Fu before long and was about to set off, but because there were many tugboats, it could not go straight. As it was heading downstream, it was about to turn its head when the Dahua ship was about to enter the</p>
<p>port. The two ships could not give way in time, and the Qianjiang Company's Hengxing ship collided with the tugboat of the Dahua ship. The tugboat was smashed, and hundreds of boxes of tea and several passengers on board fell into the water. Fortunately, people nearby tried their best to rescue them. One passenger was rescued with serious injuries. After the Public Security Bureau's Water Police Team learned of the incident, they took the accountants and sailors of the two ships to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shengxian</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Case Occurs at Qingfeng Ridge: Qingfeng Ridge is a necessary route for people from Sheng and Xin to Ningbo, Hangzhou, and Shaoxing. The mountains are towering, and there are no villages in the vicinity. Yesterday (the 22nd) at around 10:00 AM, several shipping boats</p>
<p>were traveling upstream on the Shanxi River, including a pointed-head boat hired exclusively by Sheng and Xin passengers. Because the boat was inspected by the security corps for a long time when it reached Sanjie, it fell behind. Unexpectedly, when it reached the vicinity of the Qingfeng Temple, more than a dozen bandits suddenly appeared, standing on the shore, all wearing firearms. They shouted for the boat to approach the shore, boarded the boat all at once, and ransacked boxes and cabinets, robbing all the cash and valuables of the passengers. They also kidnapped five men and one woman, releasing one man and one woman each on the shore. The names of the four kidnapped people are unknown. It is heard that one of them is an accountant from a certain cloth shop in the city.</p>
<p>Bandits Burn Down Zhang Zuojun's Residence: On June 15, several bandit letters were found in Waizhai Village, Baini Dun Township, First District, Sheng County, and sent to the village head for distribution. One of the letters was delivered to Zhang Zuojun's house, extorting 6,000 yuan. It was stipulated that the land be accepted. If he did not comply, he would be killed and the house burned down without mercy. The letter was signed by Zhang Guosheng, the Commander of the Hongjun Army. Subsequently, bandits came in person to urge him several times, but Zhang ignored them. The bandits held a grudge and came to the village on the afternoon of the 21st of this month to burn the house. In an instant, the fire blazed into the sky, and the multi-story house and the bungalows were turned to ashes. Then, they wanted to burn the residence of Zhang Qingshan, Zhang Zuojun's brother, but were spared after the neighbors pleaded. The bandits left a letter (this letter was delivered to Zhang Zuojun, Zhang Qingshan, and Zhang Nansan, stating that they must leave within three days) and fired shots to intimidate them before leaving.</p>
<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>Hu's 1st Regiment Triumphantly Arrives in Anhui　The 1st Regiment of Hu Zongnan's 1st Division, under orders to suppress bandits in Anhui, has repeatedly achieved success. The bandit atmosphere in Anhui has been slightly reduced. This regiment, the 1st Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the said division, arrived in Anhui on the afternoon of the 23rd via the Shu County land route and is stationed in various locations. When the division first entered Anhui, in addition to the original troops, it also commanded the Independent 33rd Brigade under Tang Yunshan. Recently, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission sent a telegram ordering the 1st and 2nd Anhui Garrison Brigades under Shi Zhongcheng and Li Yanqing to be placed under the control and dispatch of the division. Division Commander Hu Zongnan will soon come to the province from Shucheng to discuss everything with Chairman Wu Zhongxin and inspect Li Yanqing's brigade, which has recently arrived in the province. According to military sources, the division has received orders to open the Han River waterway, and ships have docked in Anhui awaiting transport, but this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>The Longdai River Case Has Been Resolved　The Anhui Construction Department previously sent engineer Li Jixiang to Su County to join engineers Lei Hongji from the Huai River Guidance Committee and commissioners from Jiangsu Province to investigate the dispute over the Longdai River between Su and Xiao counties. The Construction Department now reports that the dispute has been temporarily resolved, with Xiao County agreeing to fill a section of both the Longdai and Xiao rivers, totaling more than three li in length. Workers from Su County have also been withdrawn. It is proposed that after surveying the Suyi River downstream, then along the Longdai River to the upper reaches of Xiao County, they will return to Beijing to discuss a fundamental plan.</p>

<h3>Enrollment at Central University Is Still Difficult to Be Optimistic</h3>
<p>Constrained by National Issues</p>
<p>The Misfortune of Middle School Graduates</p>
<p>Since Central University was reorganized under President Li Siguang, who arrived in Beijing this Monday, all issues concerning professors and students have been resolved. However, the middle schools that had suspended enrollment requested the Central University Reorganization Committee to consider the prospects of the graduates of various schools so that they would have a place to continue their education. Chairman Cai Yuanpei has been in Shanghai for many days, and other committee members here, due to the repeated requests of representatives from various middle schools, also went to Shanghai but found no satisfactory solution. The Reorganization Committee, together with the education administrative authorities, resolved the reorganization plan. After the plan was executed by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education by order, there were practical difficulties. Only if those implementing education and executing orders consider that there is room for consideration or delay the execution can a solution be sought. The Reorganization Committee has no possibility of automatically reconsidering the matter or proposing another suggestion. If various middle schools are indeed in difficult circumstances, they can directly study the matter with the President of Central University in the future. According to those familiar with the situation of all parties, enrollment at Central University may be difficult to achieve. As the education administrative authorities are now determined to rectify the situation, the merger of Shanghai University and the University Council and the temporary suspension of enrollment at Peking University are inevitable. How can a concession be made for the enrollment of Central University alone, which would affect the original position regarding other schools? For example, Central University teachers have not resolved the issue of salary arrears, even though they advocate paying full salaries for February, March, April, May, June, and July, because the government cannot make a special case for one school. Therefore, there is still no solution. (Central University has not yet paid 50% of July's salary.) This is because it is constrained by national issues.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Secretariat Organization Expanded</h3>
<p>New Dean of the College of Engineering Takes Office</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Registration of New Students in Shanghai</p>
<p>National Zhejiang University, including the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, and Agriculture, has had its administrative structure divided among the three colleges due to historical reasons. Although there is a Secretariat, it only handles routine documents. Recently, President Cheng Tianfang, feeling that the measures were scattered and ineffective, decided to centralize administrative power in the Secretariat. In the future, the deans of each college will focus on teaching and academic equipment. The Secretariat will be divided into six sections: Documents, Registration, Accounting, Affairs, Graphics, and Publications, each with a director, and the Secretary-General will be in charge of all sections. Huang Huabiao, an education expert and former Director of the Guangxi Education Department, has been hired as Secretary-General and will also serve as Director of the Documents Section. Yu Ziyi, the secretary, will also serve as Director of the Registration Section, Ouyang Xianyi, the secretary, will also serve as Director of the Graphics Section, Meng Guangzhao will be the Director of the Affairs Section, Tang Zimei will be the Director of the Accounting Section, and Hu Changqi will be the Director of the Publications Section. The internal organization of the Secretariat has been largely completed and is currently busy taking over the administrative part of each college. Xue Shaoqing, the newly hired dean of the College of Engineering, arrived in Hangzhou yesterday and has taken over the affairs of the college. Xue received a degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University in the United States. After returning to China, he served as the head of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Central University for four years and was recently hired as a specialist member of the Construction Committee. He is rich in both knowledge and experience, and the faculty and students of the college warmly welcomed him upon his arrival. The school's first entrance examination for new students was held in Shanghai, and 800 applicants registered, which can be described as enthusiastic. The examination has now been completed, and the test papers have been sent to Hangzhou for review. The results will be announced in about a few days, and the second entrance examination will be held in Hangzhou around August 20th. In terms of moral education, the school will abolish the Moral Education Office and replace it with life instructors to guide students' lives on campus, starting from the next semester. Gan Jiaxin, Qiu Zuanzu, He Changrong, and Tang Liling have been hired to take on these positions.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Private Zhengcun Middle School Adds a Senior High School</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Private Zhengcun Middle School was founded with funds donated by local merchants such as Qian Weiqi. It has been ten years since it was first named Zhengcun College, with junior high school and national studies departments. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, it was approved for registration and renamed Zhengcun Junior Middle School, with Ren Jicheng as the principal. It has held six junior high school graduations. Recently, the school felt that there were many junior high school graduates in the county, and the quota for local senior high school students was insufficient to meet the needs. The school board convened a meeting a few days ago, attended by school board members Zhu Tinghua, Wu Zengyuan, Xue Deyu, Zhang Chongzhi, Chen Gang, and others, totaling more than ten people. It was decided that starting from the 21st year, a senior high school would be added, recruiting one class of first-year students in the general studies department. Temporary and regular expenses have been arranged, and Ji Chengfan has been reappointed as the principal. It has been reported to the Education Department for approval to add the school in accordance with the current regulations for private schools.</p>

The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Students' Movement to Protect the School</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Reception for Journalists</p>
<p>Representatives Went to Beijing to Issue a Declaration</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Promised to Ask the Authorities to Withdraw Their Decision</p>
<p>Riri News reported that after the Executive Yuan passed the Ministry of Education's proposal to merge the Colleges of Law and Education of National Jinan University, the overseas Chinese students felt a great sense of responsibility. In order to safeguard their vital interests and the cause of overseas Chinese education, in addition to the faculty and the school protection association of all students successively sending representatives to Beijing to petition and issuing a school protection declaration, they specifically held a reception for reporters from local newspapers and news agencies at the Central Press Club at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to report all the details, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Process of the Merger　Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, all cultural institutions in Shanghai, such as the Commercial Press, the Oriental Library, and Tongji and Jinan Universities, were destroyed by artillery fire and suffered heavy losses. The Ministry of Education, due to financial difficulties, had difficulty restoring them in a short time. Also, because Shanghai and Beijing were close by, and the capital already had the establishment of the College of Law and the College of Education at Central University, the decision was made to merge the Colleges of Law and Education of Jinan University in order to save expenses and avoid duplication of academic systems and to transfer the students of the two colleges to Central University.</p>
<p>Reasons for Protecting the School　When the association hosted the reporters, Zhu Dunli and Ye Damou first reported the reasons for protecting the school, stating that the greatest mission of Jinan University lies in training overseas Chinese children and cultivating advanced academic knowledge to enable them to develop overseas, especially the Colleges of Education and Law, which have the task of cultivating overseas Chinese teachers and studying the political economy of Southeast Asia. Therefore, without Jinan University, there would be no overseas Chinese education. Without the Colleges of Education and Law, the overseas Chinese children returning to China would not receive teacher training and the opportunity to study Southeast Asian law and economics. If they were transferred to other schools, they would not only have an awkward situation due to the different lives and languages of overseas Chinese children, but would also fundamentally lose the original intention of cultivating overseas Chinese education. According to the facts, the College of Commerce of Central University was completely destroyed by artillery fire in the Shanghai war, but there was no news of contraction or merger. The College of Medicine of Central University has not been heard to have merged with Tongji University due to economic exhaustion. So why does the Ministry of Education only want to merge the Colleges of Law and Education of Jinan University, which has a special mission? Therefore, our school protection movement has full reasons and will never stop until our goal is achieved.</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei's Statement　Mr. Cai Jiemin specially came to the Central Press Club at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. The society sent three representatives, Zhu Dunli, Tao Yi, and Tang Jingzong, to state the reasons for protecting the school. Mr. Wu immediately expressed his complete acceptance and promised to make strong suggestions to the government authorities in order to withdraw their decision.</p>
<p>Petition in Beijing　The school protection movement felt that the merger of the two colleges of law and education would have a significant impact on overseas Chinese education. A decision was made at the meeting the day before yesterday to send Hu Shouyu, Du Ping, and Zeng Yifu with petitions to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education in Beijing the night before to request the withdrawal of the decision.</p>
<p>Visiting School Board Members　In addition to sending personnel to Beijing to petition, the association also specially sent representatives Zhu Dunli and others today to visit the two school board members, Wu Tiecheng and Kong Xiangxi, to state the reasons for protecting the school and request their strong support.</p>
<h3>Graduates Go to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th　Wang Wei, representative of the Jinan University Alumni Association, and others, asked the Ministry of Education to withdraw the decision to merge the colleges. The Ministry of Education sent Secretary Gao to meet them, explaining the government's views on reorganizing the universities. Their request was not understood.</p>
<h3>Current Graduates of Labor University Protect the School</h3>
<p>The special commissioner sent by the Ministry of Education to take over the current graduates of Labor University was the subject of the recommendation of representatives Wang Fuhai and Wen Jimu. When the commissioner visited the school the day before yesterday, they expressed their opinions, asking the Ministry of Education to publish the Labor University's revival plan before taking over the school, and also questioned the problem of introducing the work of the current graduates. It was heard that yesterday morning, a general meeting of all graduate students staying at the temporary school site on Ladu Road was convened, with 24 people present, chaired by Zeng Xiyou, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Please ask the Ministry of Education to announce the school board of the school as soon as possible; (2) Send representatives to visit the receiving commissioner again; (3) Contact former graduates to organize a general association of graduates to discuss school protection matters; (4) Urge the Ministry of Education to introduce work and request temporary living expenses before being hired, and more than ten other items.</p>
<h3>Farewell Reception for Students Going Abroad Will Start Preparing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and the Universal Chinese Students' Association initiated preparations for a farewell reception for this year's students going abroad. It was previously reported that the College of Commerce of National Central University, the Minbao Museum, the Chenbao Museum, and the Commercial Press had participated. Yesterday, Guanghua University, the Tsinghua Alumni Association, Qixiu Girls' Middle School, the Huamei Cooperative Society, the International Issues Research Association, the Great Evening News, and the Zhonghua Book Company agreed to participate. It is heard that the preparatory committee will hold a preparatory meeting at 5:00 p.m. next Monday at Hua'an Building on the eighth floor across from the Racecourse to discuss all the proceedings. Each group has appointed representatives to attend.</p>
<h3>Boy Scout Council Moves Back to Original Address</h3>
<p>Will Convene Citywide Service Personnel for Intensified Training</p>
<p>The Shanghai Boy Scout Council, formerly located at Yi Xiang Li 128, Ximen, was about to close down due to lack of funds after the January 28th Incident. Fortunately, the Moore Memorial Church on Sanma Road offered preferential treatment, so it moved to the headquarters of the Boy Scout group at the church to continue its work and handle war zone services. Now that Shanghai has returned to normal, it recently moved to 167 Wenmiao Road, Ximen, to work. It is recently known that the 24th Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee has passed the resolution to have the Civil Movement Guidance Office send a letter to the Ministry of Education to order the education halls and bureaus of all provinces and cities to order the education bureaus and schools of all counties under their jurisdiction to stop the training of volunteer soldiers. From now on, this training will be incorporated into Boy Scout training. In order to promote the Boy Scout cause, the council will convene citywide service personnel and intensify training to live up to the expectations of the Central Committee.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Astonishing Record at Jiangwan Road: The China Tennis Club Crushes Japan 10-5</h3>
<p>The China Club Narrowly Loses the Group A Championship Despite Being Expected to Win</p>
<p>The Japan Tennis Club Wins the Championship by a Mere Two Points</p>
<p>|| Closing of the Lawn Tennis League ||</p>
<p>The China Tennis Club displayed its might yesterday, unexpectedly defeating the formidable Japan Tennis Club by a score of 10-5 at the Jiangwan Japan Tennis Court. The Group A Lawn Tennis League also concluded, with the China Club losing the championship to the Japan Club by a mere two points, marking the fourth consecutive year the Japan Club has retained the title, causing much sighing and stamping of feet.</p>
<p>Exceptional Results Against the Japan Club</p>
<p>(1) Lin Binhua and Zheng Zhaojia defeated Hyosuke Tawara and Machida 6-1, 8-6, 6-1</p>
<p>(2) Tu Kaiyuan and Qian Yaobin defeated Oka and Matsunaga 8-6, 6-1, 7-9</p>
<p>(3) Ma Anquan and Qian Wenbao defeated Yamaguchi and Sato 2-6, 6-3, 6-4</p>
<p>(4) Yu Tianguang and Feng Xikang defeated Noguchi and Kyokawa 6-2, 6-3, 6-3</p>
<p>(5) Wu Zhuren and Liang Deguang defeated Wada and Uchida 5-7, 6-1, 6-1</p>
<p>Losing the Title by Just Two Points is a Cause for Triple Regret</p>
<p>Before yesterday's final, the Japan Tennis Club led with a total score of 73 to 66 over the China Tennis Club. Out of yesterday's 15 matches, if China could win 12, they would win the championship. If they won 11, it would be a tie, requiring another final. Unexpectedly, they won exactly 10, resulting in a loss by two points. The excellent opportunity to win the championship slipped away, causing much dismay. The total scores of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name, Total Matches, Wins, Losses</p>
<p>Champion, Japan Club, 105 matches, 78, 27</p>
<p>Runner-up, China Club, 105 matches, 76, 29</p>
<p>Two Setbacks for the China Tennis Club</p>
<p>In terms of strength and opportunity, the China Tennis Club was truly superior this season. However, due to a lack of determination, the championship was lost. They won by only 8-7 on the South Grass Court, and then lost by 7-8 at the Country Club. After these two setbacks, although they showed final determination yesterday, it was already a struggle. The complete results of the two teams are listed below for reference:</p>
<p>China Club Japan Club</p>
<p>Won against North Grass Court 15-0 Won against North Grass Court 11-4</p>
<p>Won against South Grass Court 8-7 Won against South Grass Court 12-3</p>
<p>Won against French Business Club 13-2 Won against French Business Club 12-3</p>
<p>Won against Portugal 9-6 Won against Portugal 12-3</p>
<p>Won against Xiejiao 14-1 Won against Xiejiao 15-0</p>
<p>Lost to the Country Club 7-8 Won against Country Club 11-5</p>
<p>Won against Japan Club 10-5 Lost to China Club 5-10</p>
<p>Total 76-29 Total 78-27</p>
<p>Yesterday's Championship Lost Despite Being Within Reach</p>
<p>Looking at the preceding results, the China Club controlled the entire court yesterday. Scores of 12-3 and 11-4 were entirely possible. However, the 10-5 result shows a championship lost despite being winnable. The first team of Lin and Zheng was unstoppable, winning the first set 6-1. They were leading 5-2 in the second set, but because they took victory too easily, the Japanese team caught up to 5-5 and ultimately they conceded the set 8-10. Isn't this strange? If the third and fifth teams could have each won one more set, everything would have been resolved. In the final set of the second team, they fought hard but lost 7-9. Wasn't this extreme bad luck? Overall, the Japanese team was actually quite ordinary and unremarkable.</p>
<p>Lin Binhua and Zheng Zhaojia Overcome Formidable Opponents</p>
<p>Yesterday's interest was focused on the first team of Lin and Zheng versus Tawara, as neither team had lost before. This was essentially a battle for the Shanghai doubles championship and a prediction of the Rotary Cup outcome.</p>
<p>Lin and Zheng Control the Entire Court In terms of both skill and strategy, Lin and Zheng were able to dominate and control the entire court, making a straight-set victory a foregone conclusion. Tawara served, but Lin and Zheng immediately won the point. The Japanese team then regained a game, but after that, Lin and Zheng went on a rampage, winning five consecutive games to win the first set.</p>
<p>Winning Too Easily Leads to Loss In the second set, Zheng served with undiminished momentum, holding a 3-0 lead firmly in their grasp. However, bad luck struck, and Lin and Zheng became complacent, gradually relaxing because they thought victory was too easy, and they still led 5-2. Unexpectedly, the Japanese team seized the opportunity and won three consecutive games. The Chinese team still led 6-5 and 7-6, but Zheng gradually showed signs of fatigue, and with a loss of serve, the second set was lost.</p>
<p>Lin Binhua's Masterpiece After losing that point in the second set, they redoubled their efforts in the third set, winning it easily 6-1. Lin Binhua's performance yesterday, facing such a formidable opponent, can be described as a rare masterpiece. His angled shots, placements, net play, and re-serves were all highly praised. On several occasions, his re-serves left Tawara unable to return the ball. Zheng Zhaojia still has a weakness in his forehand, often being in a passive position. The Japanese team's defeat was due to Machida's poor performance, but Machida has improved greatly compared to last year.</p>
<p>The Youyou Cup: The Second Set Between Qian and Guo Has Not Yet Concluded and Will Be Played Today Both sides will undoubtedly exert all their strength to compete. The remaining teams of Yu and Tu, and Liu and Liang, are also expected to have significant results. The schedule for today is listed below:</p>
<p>4:00 PM 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Wang Minzhu vs. Li Yong Qian Yaobin vs. Guo Qida</p>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan vs. Yu Tianguang Wu Zhuren vs. Shen Bogui</p>

<p>Random Notes</p>
<h3>The Riddle of Cooling Off (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Gentlemen who are cooling off, we meet again in this small garden.</p>
<p>Whether you guessed the three riddles offered last time or not, I cannot help but expose this illusion myself and reveal all the answers:</p>
<p>(1) Under the scorching sun, singing the tune of the lawless emperor, is the cicada. The hotter the sun, the louder the cicada's song, just chirping "I know, I know" without end! Therefore, the cicada's alias is "I know." Some write it as 𧊄蟟. The emperor's tune of the past only made "I know, I know" his mantra. The cicada is also singing "I know, I know," only lacking the word "way," so it is said to be the lawless emperor. This riddle is easy to guess as Puyi, who relies on the power of the scorching sun. In fact, Puyi is also a pathetic creature, no different from the cicada singing "I know, I know." When autumn cools down and the power of the scorching sun wanes, I fear he will also become a silent cicada after autumn.</p>
<p>(2) After Shigemitsu Mamoru's leg amputation, a saying from the Zuo Zhuan lost its effectiveness. This saying is called: "Even the sunflower can protect its foot." Because the sunflower leaves turn towards the sun, preventing sunlight from reaching its roots, there is a saying that the sunflower can protect its foot. Shigemitsu Mamoru lost his foot, so the sunflower cannot protect his foot! Therefore, the saying from the Zuo Zhuan lost its effectiveness.</p>
<p>(3) Aid Ma Yuan, Ma Yuan can be paired with lament. Lament Niu Ai, Niu Ai. The upper couplet, read forwards or backwards, is these five characters: the lower couplet, read forwards or backwards, is also these five characters. In the upper couplet, Ma Yuan is an ancient person, used to compare to the anti-Japanese General Ma Zhanshan; in the lower couplet, Niu Ai is also an ancient person. The Huainanzi says that Niu Ai fell ill for seven days and transformed into a tiger, and so on. Used to compare to Niu Lan, who used hunger strikes to coerce, is clearly an act of a lamentable party, but he can also be called Niu Ai. Because the Niu couple is on a hunger strike, some people lament them and want to find a way to rescue them from danger. Therefore, lament Niu Ai, Niu Ai. The five characters are also related to the current situation. Furthermore, it was recently heard in Shanghai that a yellow ox waiting to be slaughtered escaped halfway and knelt down in a factory, begging the factory owner with tears streaming down its face. The factory owner was moved and bought it, taking it to the release station to save its life. This yellow ox that knelt down to beg can also be called Niu Ai, and the factory owner saving its life is also lament Niu Ai, Niu Ai. The only difference is that the Niu couple on a hunger strike and the Niu who knelt down are one a fake Niu and one a real Niu.</p>
<h3>Entrusting to Mrs. Ayscough</h3>
<p>— Qu Cheng</p>
<p>Next to the Jade Buddha Temple, in the middle of Binlang Road, there is a black lacquer shikumen. The gatehouse is carved with Li Bai and Du Fu playing chess. This is the residence of the daughter and son-in-law of the late British merchant, "Hui Defeng." The son-in-law's surname is Ayscough, and his name is Florence. Florence Ayscough was formerly a clerk in the Hui Defeng Company. He was aloof in nature and quite capable in handling affairs. Because of this, he gained the favor of the daughter. After their marriage, the daughter's father died of old age, and this enormous inheritance also passed to Ayscough through his wife.</p>
<p>The lady has always enjoyed studying Chinese literature, and even in her diet and daily life, she only finds pleasure in things that are "non-Chinese." Through more than ten years of research, she has gained considerable insights into Chinese poetry and prose. She is engaged in translating Tang poems to introduce them to people in her country. A certain university in Canada heard of her name and awarded her a doctoral degree.</p>
<p>Since then, the lady has been even more diligent in her studies, and her name has become increasingly famous. Whenever she lectures, there are always tens of thousands of listeners. She has broadcasted on radio stations to various countries, and her words all praise Chinese propriety. She especially promotes the old virtues of "chastity" and "three obediences and four virtues" for women. The lady even sets an example for her husband, and she is no less than Meng Zhuang to Liang Hong.</p>
<p>Through the lady's years of loud calls, scholars and women in her country have gradually paid more attention to her scholarship. In this way, there will definitely be many people who will follow in the lady's footsteps and promote her teachings. Now that our modern women are despising the inherent virtues, compared to the lady who cherishes them as treasures, can we not feel ashamed?</p>
<h3>Summer Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>In recent days, the temperature in Shanghai has suddenly increased, reaching 103 degrees at its hottest, a new record not seen since the beginning of the year. As a result, the people of Shanghai are seeking ways to escape the heat. Here are some of the most interesting and novel methods, also to add to the conversation while enjoying watermelon and plum juice.</p>
<p>Sudden Rain at Zhaofeng Park The best places to escape the heat in Shanghai are the four major parks, especially Zhaofeng Park, with its dense shade and clear springs, which is most popular among Chinese and Westerners. Therefore, every day at sunset, when the cicadas sing in the evening, Zhaofeng Park becomes a gathering place for men and women, strolling arm in arm, resembling a fairy realm. One day, the heat was sweltering, and the intense heat felt like roasting. At 5:00 PM, the gates of Zhaofeng Park were already crowded with traffic. To entertain visitors, the park hired a Western band to play music, charging a fee of 40 cents. The seats were also filled with listeners. Just as the music began at 5:30 PM, dark clouds suddenly gathered, and heavy rain poured down. As a result, before the end of a song, both the performers and the attendees fled in a panic. The scene of chaos was truly indescribable. I was on my way to the zoo at the time, and I looked around for a place to shelter, so I temporarily stood under a giant tree, hoping to find a moment's peace under the dense shade. However, the rain became heavier and heavier, becoming torrential after a quarter of an hour. My shirt was completely soaked, and my straw hat was filled with water, almost like a drowned chicken. At that moment, the cries of women and the screams of children blended together, echoing the sound of wind and rain. After half an hour, the rain subsided slightly, and I walked out of the park gate. The young women in their thin, cicada-wing-like fashions were especially drenched. Everyone cried out that the heavens were not being kind.</p>
<p>Quick Ferry Across the Huangpu River After visiting the park for a long time, I felt dispirited. A friend proposed a night ferry across the Huangpu River. As soon as the idea was proposed, more than ten people responded, each bringing their families. At 8:30 PM, the group gathered at the Bund bronze statue pier and boarded the Public Utilities Bureau ferry in single file. The ferry was divided into two classes. The highest class was called the special class, mostly occupied by Westerners, with a round trip fare of $1.50. The next class was the first class, with a round trip fare of 80 cents. As the ferry sailed, a refreshing breeze gently brushed against our clothes. Soon, we moved further away from the bustling city area of Shanghai. We only saw three or five fishing boats drifting in the middle of the river, and the opposite bank was shrouded in mist, making it impossible to discern what was there. After a while, the bright moon rose, as large as a wheel, and the rippling river reflected its dazzling light. We leaned against the railing and reminisced about the past, the heat completely gone. Mr. and Mrs. Xiaoguang distributed the food they had prepared to their friends, and we sat together happily, enjoying unlimited joy. The boat traveled for half an hour and docked at Donggou. After 15 minutes, it sailed back up the river and arrived at Gaoqiao around 9:00 PM. We disembarked together. At that time, the river breeze was gentle, as if it were early autumn. We walked for about four minutes and arrived at a hotel. The electric lights were bright, and the furnishings were quite good, with cold snacks and refreshments available inside, but the prices were very high. We went to a teahouse to drink tea and sat around for half an hour. The river moon was like a painting, and the rural scenery under the clear sky was especially beautiful. We returned to the boat at 11:00 PM, all worldly concerns gone. The wind picked up, and amidst laughter and song, we returned to Shanghai after midnight.</p>
<h3>Remembering Dinghu Mountain Amidst the Sweltering Heat</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Dinghu Mountain in Zhaoqing is a famous mountain in South China, also known as the seventeenth blessed place in the world by Buddhists. Surrounded by mountains, the scenery is magnificent. Ancient trees are lush and dense, blocking out the sunlight. Hidden in the mountainside is a majestic ancient temple covering 30 acres, called Qingyun Temple. The carved beams and painted buildings are incredibly grand. The temple has more than 300 monks, and the number of workers and children is also similar. Inside, there are dozens of elegant guest rooms for tourists to stay. To the left of the temple is a waterfall that thunders through the valley and flows for a thousand feet. On the mountain peak is the always cloud-protected Laodinghu Temple. There are many famous scenic spots and historical sites in the mountains. For example, on the Xixin Pavilion, there is a horizontal plaque with the inscription "Wash Away Impurities" personally inscribed by Zhang Taiyan when he visited during the Bingchen National Protection War. In the guest hall on the side of the Daxiong Hall, there are couplets written by Sun Yat-sen, "Equality of All Beings" and "All Sentient Beings," and a horizontal plaque by Cen Chunxuan, "Deep in the Mountains." Below the steps is a long couplet written by He Ruidan: "As I have heard, the sound of wind, the sound of rain, the sound of springs, the sound of birds, harmonize with the sound of Zen throughout the courtyard. Entering this gate, one suddenly understands." "As can be seen today, the colors of mountains, the colors of clouds, the colors of trees, and the scenery of the four seasons. Arriving at this place, all colors are empty." Completely natural and refined, unusually fitting. There are also the world's unique campanula flowers and five-colored azaleas, Dendrobium loddigesii, and Impatiens urophylla in the mountains, countless rare flowers and exotic herbs, many of which can be used as medicine. Climbing up from Luo Yin's Spring to the mountain takes a journey of 18 li to reach Qingyun Temple. Along the way, birds chirp and springs murmur. The mountains are full of lush greenery, and a gentle breeze comes from time to time, warm in winter and cool in summer, sweeping away all worldly concerns. In the Feishui Pool, a gentle breeze blows, and fine waves float. The water is clear and bottomless. Swimming and bathing is refreshing to the heart and spleen. The sound of bells and the shadows of trees clear all thoughts. One almost feels like they are in the Guanghan Palace and no longer knows the intense heat of summer. Every summer, the number of tourists is no less than that of Mogan Mountain in Zhejiang and Lushan Mountain in Jiangxi, and the famous summer resorts such as Qingdao and Beidaihe in the north. I have visited three times, staying for a month each time. Whenever I remember the past during the summer, I am always fascinated. As I put down my pen here, a cool breeze rustles, as if I am in the Mianlu Pavilion. But thinking of the passing of Xindan and the farewell of Huikong, thinking of the new and feeling the old, feeling the previous battles, even in the sweltering heat, I cannot help but have autumn thoughts.</p>
<h3>Worth Introducing National Goods Factories (12)</h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>(2) (1) Coal Ball Factory</p>
<p>Coal was invented in our country. Originally, it was a utilization of waste. At first, the sea coal industry king, Mr. Liu Hongsheng, saw that it was a pity to discard coal dust. He spent 5,000 yuan to order Japanese people to build machines for manufacturing coal balls. Once built, he established the China Coal Ball Factory. Business was booming. Up to now, China has factories one, two, and three. It's up to the people. This must be credited to Mr. Liu's vision and perseverance.</p>
<p>There are more than ten coal ball factories in Shanghai, such as China, China, Greater China, Greater China, Far East, Huacheng, Guohua, and Nanyang. Most of them are in Pudong and along Xushe Road.</p>
<p>Coal balls are clean and fire-resistant, and people are happy to use them. However, they must be made of white coal dust. The stoves that burn coal balls mostly have no chimneys, so the dust from bituminous coal cannot be used. When making coal balls, yellow soil must be mixed with the coal dust. Yellow soil from Suzhou is best, because it is sticky and loose. On the one hand, it is easy to solidify, and on the other hand, it is easy to burn. Yellow soil from other places cannot compare. Some say that flammable materials are mixed in the coal balls, but this is nonsense. Two to three percent of yellow soil can be mixed with each ton of coal dust, but it is best to mix 1.7 percent. Too much will not only make it less fire-resistant, but also make it difficult to light. In fact, the quality of coal balls depends not only on the quality of the coal, but also on the amount of yellow soil mixed in.</p>
<p>Our country produces a lot of white coal, but it is still in short supply. If coal dust is used to make balls on a large scale, it will certainly not be enough. In addition to buying a small amount of white coal dust from Shanxi, most of it comes from Annam. Japan has a lot of bituminous coal, which cannot be used.</p>
<p>Our country's machinery factories can now copy coal ball manufacturing machines. The machines come in different sizes. Some produce 114 balls per rotation, some 140, and some 160. The price is around 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Although coal balls can be made by hand, like beating charcoal, if you want to sell them, you must use machines. The entire machine is divided into three parts: (1) a grinding machine, (2) a mud mixing machine, and (3) a ball making machine. The coal dust must go through the above three steps to become a ball, and then it falls from the lower part of the ball making machine like rain. It is then dried on a wire mesh screen in a baking oven and manually loaded into baskets.</p>
<p>The above machines produce 30 to 40 tons of coal balls per day. The market price is around 24 yuan per ton. The market price of Annam coal dust is around 11 taels per ton.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market Re-emerges with Sharpness</h3>
<p>Increased by 6.8 Taels</p>
<p>Exceeding 750 Taels Transacted. Yesterday, the 27th, the gold market demonstrated vibrancy, with transactions proceeding swiftly and methodically. Initially, the market was calm, but later it showed its sharpness, with a difference of up to 6.5 taels between the high and low prices within half a day. The opening prices were slight, but eventually the prices climbed nearly 7 taels. Although the price of large bars rose at the start, it did not cause any disturbance. This was because the silver price did not move, and the futures silver price fell. Subsequently, the price remained between 746 taels and 747 taels, and there were no bulk transactions from various parties. Furthermore, bid tickets went from stable to tight, and there were rumors of a certain bank selling off spot goods. As a result, major players suddenly began to compete to buy, and the buying interest surged, causing the market to become very aggressive and exceed 750 taels. Finally, the price slightly decreased. Later in the day, due to the intense heat and the lack of foreign exchange market activity, the market was temporarily suspended for half a day, and it was expected that normal operations would resume once the weather cooled down. Below is a record of the morning's activities.</p>
<p>High Opening Prices Observed Early On. The market opened with a rise of 2.9 mace for September contracts, reaching 747.5 taels. Although the British bank rate was reported to be 1/8 higher, the American bank's public telegrams were as before, and private telegrams were slightly higher at 1/16. Moreover, the exchange rate suddenly fell by 1.125 points, causing sellers to become excited. Companies such as Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Heng, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Chang Yong, and Zhi Feng Yong all sold off, causing the price to fall by 1.67 mace. However, there were only a few mace fluctuations, totaling only 45.8 taels. The exchange rate was flat. The initial closing price for U.S. dollars for this month was 81.25, followed by banks buying at 81.25 for August and 30.0125 for October. Both buying and selling were possible. Market participants such as Hong Kang Yong, Yu He, Yuan Xing Yong, Heng Yu, and Yi Feng Yong all bought, while Tong Tai Chang and Heng Chang Yong sold. The market price fluctuated slightly by 7-8 mace, reaching 46.8 taels at 9:15. Later, HSBC offered U.S. dollars for August at 8.75 and for October at 0.0625, and Yokohama Specie Bank and Holland traded English gold for September at 1.825. Therefore, the price returned to 46 taels. At 9:30, HSBC's listed price for English gold remained unchanged, while U.S. dollars decreased by 0.125, resulting in a slight squeeze on the exchange rate. Rui Xing, Yi Feng Yong, Fu Tai Heng, and Yuan Tai all bought, adding one tael. At 10:00, the price was 47 taels, after which the market became mediocre, with fluctuations of no more than 5-6 mace. There were also no large transactions from various firms. Subsequently, due to selling from Tong Tai Chang, Da De Cheng, and retail investors, and because Yokohama Specie Bank sold English gold for October to HSBC at 1.83125, the price retreated by 7-8 mace, reaching 46.2 taels at 10:30. Then the market became peaceful.

In addition, retail investors who had sold in the morning had to chase after the price, as U.S. dollars became tighter. Banks were buying at 75 for this month.</p>
<p>Bank Buying of Spot Goods Further Boosts Market Sentiment. It was also reported that a certain bank sold off 420 bars of spot goods, greatly improving market sentiment.

Therefore, the price was suppressed to 51 taels after five minutes. At noon closing, the price was 51.4 taels, and then it reached around one tael. Articles were traded at a small amount of 4 mace. Compared to the previous day, the listed price increased by 6.8 taels.

<h3>Foreign Copper Coins Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Market Situation: Yesterday, the silver dollar market could be divided into two situations. The silver market saw a gradual increase in transactions of discount tickets, and the demand seemed to be improving. Therefore, the market price generally improved. Although there was no concern about a lack of support, there was a feeling of difficulty, which eventually turned into hope. The price of foreign copper coins was shaky in the face of the reform, and there was no difference between the long and short positions, so there was no competitive action. As a result, the performance gradually deteriorated and fell.</p>
<p>Copper Coins Fell, Discount Tickets Were Popular: The price of foreign copper coins fell by half a li in the morning market compared to the previous day, to 6 qian 9 fen 1 li. The price continued to fall by half a li in the afternoon market, to 6 qian 9 fen 0.5 li. As a result, the price fell a total of 1 li in both markets. The price of silver discount tickets was 1 qian 5 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, which was 1 fen higher than the previous day. The bank's listed price was still 6 fen, and the initial extra water was 2 qian, which finally closed at 1 qian 6 fen. This was because the support was moderately tight and loose.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coins and K'ais Fell: Small Jiangnan foreign coins increased by 1.5 li compared to the previous day, to 6 qian 0.2 li. The prices were the same in both the morning and afternoon markets. Transactions totaled 4,000 jiao in the morning market and 1,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Small Guangdong foreign coins were completely consistent with the price changes in the morning and afternoon markets of the previous day. The price was 5 qian 8 fen 8 li in the morning market and 5 qian 8 fen 7.5 li in the afternoon market. Transactions totaled 105,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins suddenly increased by another 2,500 wen, to 428,000 wen. The total increase in both markets was 5,000 wen. There were also a particularly large number of transactions, totaling more than 53,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Receipts and Disbursements Were Scarce: Bank receipts and disbursements were quite idle yesterday. Chinese merchants received and disbursed 1,670,000 in ticket funds, foreign merchants received and disbursed 1,200,000 in ticket funds, and various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds received and disbursed 7,230,000. Transactions in collateralized exchange funds were 900,000 for Chinese merchants and 600,000 for foreign merchants. A total of 900,000 was deposited in warehouses by both Chinese and foreign merchants. Money shops and silver public agencies received and disbursed more than 28,000,000 in single funds, more than 4,100,000 in extra water funds, more than 600,000 in various remittances, 6-700,000 in available cash, and more than 6,000,000 in discount ticket transactions.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Transactions Were Dismal: Exchange ticket funds in the market totaled 585,000 in the morning market and 430,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes totaled 60,000 in the morning market and 25,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes outside the market totaled 115,000 in the morning market and 55,000 in the afternoon market. Only 30,000 in checks were transacted in the morning market. Bank trading totaled 400,000 in the morning inter-market and 400,000 in the afternoon inter-market. The exchange of funds between various bank accounts totaled 1,440,000. Banknote receipts and disbursements totaled 1,550,000. Money shops received and disbursed 4,900,000 in foreign gold single funds, transacted more than 500,000 in foreign collateralized exchange funds, borrowed and lent more than 1,600,000 in foreign funds, and received and disbursed more than 1,200,000 in foreign extra water funds.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds for July Have Stopped Being Auctioned</h3>
<p>Settlement and Delivery to be Handled from Today</p>
<p>Only the August Price Continued to Fall Yesterday, and the Market Condition Was Clear</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 27th), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange stopped market trading because the futures for July were about to be delivered. Various procedures were handled before delivery, so yesterday there was only one type of futures transaction in the market for August, because the futures for September had to be opened today. Yesterday, there were few transactions from various parties, and a total of 1,515,000 yuan was traded between the two markets. Except for the salt tax, which accounted for 400,000 yuan, the rest was only around 200,000 yuan. Spot transactions were even scarcer. Only 3,000 yuan of Compilation and Dismissal 20 Customs bonds were traded. Regarding the trend of various bond prices, the Northeast situation was still serious, the financial situation was also very difficult, and the market was cold due to the delivery relationship. All prices uniformly declined, resulting in a small number of angles to six or seven angles different from the previous day.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Reacts with Slight Decline</h3>
<p>(Report by American Eastern Banking Corporation)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the New York stock market opened higher than the previous day, but the selling trend gradually increased, which was a profit-taking move by short-term traders. Although the decline was not very severe, the volume reached 1.5 million shares. It was also the dividend announcement date for U.S. Steel, and most traders were nervous and suspended activities to wait for the news. Subsequently, the company finally announced that it would only pay dividends on preferred shares and would continue to suspend dividends on common shares. After the news was released, the company's stock immediately fell by one point. However, because the time was late, there were no other effects. But it is believed that most people were not greatly disappointed, because most people had already anticipated it. The decline in the stock market on Tuesday was welcomed in the real economy, as it would allow more people who intended to buy but missed the opportunity at a lower price to join in. Based on the current situation, the profit-taking seems not to be completely stopped, but it is believed that this reaction will soon recover. The Dow Jones index is attached as follows:</p>
<p>July 25 / July 26 / Change</p>
<p>30 Industrials / 49.78 / 49.04 / Down 0.74</p>
<p>20 Railroads / 18.39 / 17.78 / Down 0.61</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Yarn Market Suddenly Turns Weak</h3>
<p>Customer Sales Slightly Sluggish: Short Sellers Throw Out Large Quantities</p>
<p>Sentiment Slightly Soft: Market Prices Fall by More Than One or Two Taels</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market turned weak, and the situation was weaker because customer sales were stagnant, unlike the enthusiasm of the previous day. As a result, sentiment was slightly soft, and the market price appeared to be sluggish. However, Rong Xing, a major long player, remained calm and continued to buy and add to positions in the near month. As for the sellers, after each group sold a large amount of actual demand, they feared a long period of stagnation, and the world market was unremarkable, so they sold in the far month. Currently, the long and short sides are competing fiercely, but the bottom stocks of each factory are sold out, and the monetary situation is much looser. The attitude is quiet, and the yarn market will not fall too much for a while.</p>
<p>Human Mark Re-enters the 50 Tael Mark: At the opening of the human mark forward market, the selling pressure from the large number of sellers on the previous day was heavy. Each month fell by six or seven qian. The second board slightly recovered, and the third closed lower. As a result, each month fell by six qian to one tael two qian six qian seven qian nine qian. The transaction statistics were 33,800 bales. Xian sold 1,150 bales, Sui Long 1,550 bales, Tong Xing 1,100 bales, Chang Feng 2,100 bales, Ren Feng 700 bales, and Xin Cheng 750 bales. Yi Chang bought 3,000 bales, Xing Yuan 1,050 bales, Da Chang 800 bales, Rui Da 800 bales, Chang Ji 800 bales, Tai Xing 550 bales, and Rong Xing 400 bales. The closing prices of the human mark are listed below:</p>

<p>August / 1505 / Down 12 / 39,250 / November / 1481 / Down 1 / 996,500</p>
<p>September / 1495 / Down 1 / 266,100 / December / 1483 / Down 1 / 772,250</p>
<p>Total: 371,300</p>
<p>There are still 1,000 bales of yarn sold: The clearance of spot yarn is sluggish, but the demand from the southern port is still good. It is found that the statistics of each group buying throughout the day are 1,000 bales, and the market price has fallen by about 5 qian to one or two taels. The amount of each group buying is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong / 485 / Jiangxi / 45 / Sichuan / 50 / Luzhou / 10</p>
<p>Datong / 100 / Shantou / 200 / Mainland / 60 / Ningbo / 5 / Trade / 65 / Total / 1,000 bales</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Selling Price is Firm</h3>
<p>July Zheng Mark Delivery is Not Prosperous</p>
<p>The cotton market is firmer because American cotton is stable and the gold market is rising. Therefore, although the selling force is heavy, the spot cotton inventory is too dry, and the market price is unusually stable. Buyers are very active in purchasing spot cotton from various factories due to the current improvement in yarn sales. Therefore, the spot price is firm, and sentiment is tight. The delivery of goods in July has not been active, so the long side is becoming more secure.</p>
<p>August Zheng Mark is Particularly Tight: At the opening of the Zheng Mark forward market, the market sentiment in August was tight. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and the price rose by 2 qian. The far month was flat, and the situation was still unchanged. The closing price was slightly lower. As a result, the near month rose by 5 fen to 1 qian, and the far month fell by 5 fen. The transaction statistics were 32,300 dan. Chang Feng sold 2,300 dan, Yi Yu 2,000 dan, Xie Sheng 2,200 dan, Yu Chang 1,400 dan, Sui Long 1,600 dan, and Da Ji 1,100 dan. Ji Feng bought 2,200 dan, Yuan Da 2,300 dan, Da Chang 2,400 dan, and Yi Feng 1,800 dan. The closing prices of the Zheng Mark are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Mark Closing Price Change Account Balance / November / 3135 / - / 204,300</p>
<p>August / 3160 / Up 10 / 96,800 / December / 3130 / Down 5 / 169,000</p>
<p>October / 3135 / - / 176,500 / Total / 665,400</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Factory Demand is Active: Spot cotton demand is very active, and various factories have the intention to purchase because yarn sales are booming. The source is 250 bales of Yao cotton, and the selling prices are listed below:</p>

Futures rose by 5 to 6 points, and spot rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by one point, and spot was unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 5 points. Indian cotton was closed.

<h3>Grain and Rice Prices Suddenly Rise by Thirty to Forty Cents</h3>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, the rice market trended upward, and sentiment was excited. Due to the long period of clear weather, both shops took advantage of this opportunity to increase their inventory. In recent years, rice prices have always hardened near the beginning of autumn. The Su Tong market continued to harden by thirty to forty cents. Chang Xi Bei raised the prices of thin rice and early rice by two cents each. The sales of Lu Yang Jian were limited, and the situation was firm.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: Yesterday, the sources of supply from various routes were less than ten. The stomachs of the shops on this street were more prosperous than in the previous market. The price of Chang Su white japonica rice increased by another two or three cents. Early and late rice arrivals were also scarce, and the rural stomach was still weak. The top goods on this street were still active, and the price was approaching the ruler. The market for foreign Du Jian was also firm.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was slightly weaker because the Ningbo gang stopped buying, and the North gang and the mainland's appetite were also weak. However, the floating stock on the market had been reduced by 200,000 bags, and the daily stock in the warehouse had also been sold out in several batches. The weather had been dry for a long time without rain, and Du rice was rising. The selling price of foreign rice had reached the bottom, and the cargo owners' minds were very firm and unwilling to sell at lower prices. Therefore, the market price was not easy to have a huge decline. A total of 3,000 bags of small twisted rice were sold on the unified market at a price of 9 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen to 9 yuan 3 jiao. 200 bags of old small twisted rice were sold at a price of 9 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen to 9 yuan 2 jiao. 500 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were sold at a price of 10 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen to 10 yuan 3 jiao. Apart from 1,300 bags of small twisted rice etc. that were sold to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and the mainland, all were taken in by this street.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Stick to Standard Flour Prices, Sharply Rising</h3>
<p>Transactions are also very active... reaching 500,000 bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat flour market in the morning, the prices of each month trended vigorously upward. The quoted price of foreign wheat rose by about five or six jiao (and it was rumored that American farmers asked the government to stop auctioning futures for two months to wait for a turnaround in prices). The atmosphere in the market had already changed for a long time due to the launch of the major players. Although it was not deliberately raised, there was a huge force, so the opening price rose, and the momentum was very strong. Although there were more floats in the middle and the appearance of weakness, it still tended to rise again in an instant. The factories only sold sporadically and mostly watched. Therefore, the market went up step by step, and the transaction was the first to be seen since the opening of the market. The total market was 500,000. Looking at the future, it is expected that manufacturers will stick to their prices, and it is expected to continue to be popular. As a result, the current month was 2 fen higher than the previous day, August and September were 1.5 fen higher, October and November were 1.25 fen higher, and December was 2 fen higher.</p>
<h3>The Recent Cause of the Rise in Forward Wheat</h3>
<p>Weather is Dry... The Flour Market is Popular</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the forward wheat market in the morning, each month showed a consistent upward trend. This month was the last day. The initial opening was flat, but later there were still empty positions to offset, and the buying was not discouraged, so the outcome was very good. Each distant month, due to the reported rise in foreign wheat, and changes in the surrounding environment, the popularity of the flour market, and the people's hearts also went up step by step. It can be seen that the improvement of the wheat market was entirely stimulated by the flour market, and the weather was dry, so only a heavy rain could comfort the people's hearts. Therefore, the subsequent observation is difficult to see a decline for a while. As a result, this month rose by 5 fen, August rose by 3 fen, September rose by 4 fen, October rose by 3 fen, and November rose by 5 fen. The delivery of spot wheat totaled 38 carts. No. 24 received more than 30 carts, and other numbers received very few. The spot wheat market was shouting high by two or three fen due to the very good sentiment. The opening price of straight pond wheat was 3 taels 0.02 fen, Shuangfeng wheat was 3 taels 0.04 fen, and Penglai wheat was 3 taels 0.02 fen, down to 3 taels. Taicang wheat was 3 taels 0.02 fen, down to 2 taels 8 qian 8 fen, totaling more than 1,000 bags, which were handled by Fuxin and Xinda.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market's Coarse and White Granulated Sugar Returns to Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's public association market's clearing and trading was still active. Sentiment was very strong, and the market price rose. The transaction price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white rose from 14 taels 4 qian 7.5 fen to 14 taels 5 qian. There was also a shortage of shipments, and the market situation was very popular. Raw sand red sugar was 12 taels 2 qian 5 fen, and No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar was 10 taels 6 qian, and the trend was also very strong. Taikoo sugar was still selling smoothly in the north, so the clearing and trading market was very active. B mark was 16 taels 3 qian, CW mark was 15 taels 7 qian 5 fen to 8 qian, DY mark was 15 taels 4 qian 5 fen, HM mark was 14 taels 9 qian, and H mark was 16 taels 6 qian. The market situation was also popular. Zhenxiang offered 500 bags of No. 8 Dutch red sugar at a price of 10 taels 4 qian, but the industry's intention to buy was flat, but the market atmosphere was very stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Silk Sales Unlikely to Improve</p>
<p>Zhejiang: Due to sluggish silk sales and thick inventories, various silk weaving factories have recently reduced working hours and stopped machinery, further reducing the use of silk. Overseas silk factories are also in summer vacation, with few silk telegrams reaching Shanghai, making silk sales unlikely to improve. Yesterday, only five bales of "Earth" brand 18-22 thread white filature were delivered by a Shanghai silk factory at a price of 485 taels. In addition, ten bales of "Pine and Cypress" brand 13-22 thread white filature were delivered by hoarders at a price of 480 taels. Xiangji delivered twelve bales of Three K brand top grade Mianyang yellow silk at a price of 385 taels.</p>
<h3>New Sichuan Raw Silk Samples Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Color and Luster Better Than Old Stock</p>
<p>This year's spring cocoons in various counties of Sichuan Province have had a bountiful harvest with excellent cocoon quality. Various silk factories are now reeling new cocoons. New Sichuan raw silk samples have arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, 42 pieces arrived by mail. Sichuan silk merchants have already shown samples of the new goods to foreign firms, claiming the color and luster are better than the old stock.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Black Tea Shows Signs of Activity</h3>
<p>Since arriving in Shanghai, Wuyuan black tea has remained stagnant in the market due to poor sales of American brands. As a result, many Chinese tea merchants are inclined to break bulk for retail in order to seek sales to Africa and maintain their capital. Yesterday, Jinlong Foreign Firm, which handles American brands, began quoting prices for Wuyuan black tea and will begin operations soon. However, according to rumors among tea merchants, the firm's quoted prices are too low, and negotiations may still be difficult. The market conditions for various grades of rare and special eyebrow teas are not very quiet, and market prices are relatively firm. However, there is no major progress on the whole.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Zhanghua Striped Camel Wool Sells Exceptionally Well</h3>
<p>Striped wide and narrow camel wool piece goods are selling very well in the market, and customer groups generally have demand. Local shops and foreign goods Western clothing stores continue to order weaving from various domestic goods factories, with the "Zhanghua" brand being the most popular, as the selling price is very low and easy to profit from. Currently, the wholesale price of this brand's striped wide and narrow camel wool is only 1.6 taels of silver per yard, which is 5.5 mace cheaper than brands like Hongfa, Maoye, Xianda, and Shengda. Therefore, buyers prefer this brand, and sales are booming. As for imported brands Rongtai and Deji striped camel wool, the asking price yesterday was 2.425 taels per yard.</p>
<h3>Hardware Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Hardware prices have been soaring in recent days. According to investigations, the reasons for the price increases are partly due to a shortage of inventory and partly due to wealthy colleagues in the financial industry buying up goods, leading to a perceived shortage of spot goods in the market and skyrocketing asking prices. However, actual sales volumes are quite limited. Thick English galvanized iron, such as #24, can be sold for 10.05 taels per picul, an increase of 1.2 taels compared to before; #26 is 11.25 taels, 0.75 taels higher; #28 is 11.5 taels, also 0.25 taels higher; 3'7" is 0.09 taels, and 3'6" is 0.08 taels, each increasing by 0.02-0.03 taels. American goods have been affected by the high prices of English goods and have also increased by several cents. #48 sells for 15.5 taels, #28 for 16 taels, #26 for 15.5 taels, and #24 for 14 taels. Galvanized iron sheets have increased even more, with #28 selling for 11.25 taels, #26 for 10.075 taels, and #24 for 9 taels. Ninety-pound English tinplate can be sold for 10 taels, and 100-pound for 11.5 taels. Ninety-pound American tinplate sells for 13 taels, and 100-pound for 15 taels, each increasing by several cents. Only Huisi iron and the like have not seen major fluctuations. In addition, new lead wire prices are also rising sharply, with #16 to #20 selling for 13 taels, and #21 to #25 selling for 17.75 taels. Prices in other markets have remained relatively stable. However, in terms of transactions, the tinplate business has been particularly active recently, with merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai successively purchasing goods. It is said that 1400-1500 boxes have been sold. New lead wire sales along Changjiang Road have been unusually active, with over 400 piculs reportedly sold. Flat galvanized iron sheets with thinner patterns are moving, while those with thicker patterns are not. Market conditions in other areas remain generally lackluster. In terms of arrivals, there have been more shipments of green lead recently, which has softened prices, with each picul selling for 11.15 taels. Local lead is only selling for 11 taels. Due to sluggish sales in other markets, there is no significant difference in market conditions.</p>

<h3>First Meeting of the Research Association for Abolishing the Tael and Changing to the Yuan Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Opinions on the New Currency System Not Yet Unified</p>
<p>A Continued Meeting Scheduled for This Saturday to Discuss</p>
<p>The issue of abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan. Since Minister of Finance Song Ziwen came to Shanghai and exchanged views with various banking and financial circles in the city, three principles have been established. A research committee has been specially formed, consisting of seven Chinese and foreign experts. Banks, financial firms, and the Chamber of Commerce have also been invited to send representatives to participate in discussions and gather opinions for the government's reference. The first research meeting was held at 3 PM yesterday on the third floor of the Central Bank and adjourned at approximately 5 PM. A continued discussion is scheduled for this month on the 30th (Saturday) afternoon at the same location. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Committee Members Present: Those present at yesterday's meeting included committee members Chen Jian'an, Bei Songsun, Hu Bijiang, Keimo, Mai Zhaote, and Lei Qi, totaling six people. Representatives from the financial industry Yu Zuoting, the Chamber of Commerce Ma Jiliang, committee member Liu Hongsheng, and the Bank Association Hu Mengjia were all absent due to other commitments.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings: The meeting commenced at 3 PM, chaired by Chen Jian'an. The chairman began with a report, stating that the committee is of a research nature. Regarding the issue of abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan, the three principles established by Minister of Finance Song after referring to opinions from various circles will be further studied in depth to provide recommendations for the government's adoption. Following the report, committee members and representatives expressed their opinions. Regarding the issuance of the new currency, their attention was focused on the Currency Regulations. Because the government promulgated Currency Regulations in the third year of the Republic (1914), which stipulated a weight of more than 7.2 mace, the subsequent minting of new coins did not fully comply with the regulations, leading to confusion in the market currency. Although the recent sharp decline in foreign coins was due to the decline in domestic production and the concentration of spot goods in Shanghai, the confusion of hard currency and the inconsistency of weight were important reasons. Therefore, the minting of new coins after the abolition of the tael and the change to the yuan must not only seek uniformity in fineness but also comply with the regulations of the third year of the Republic to prevent the people from suffering invisible losses. Furthermore, attention must be paid to the minting of subsidiary coins to implement the decimal system and facilitate transactions for the people. On the other hand, some opinions considered that the minting costs required for recoining new coins would be enormous, which the government would find difficult to bear amidst the current internal and external troubles. Therefore, they believed that it was necessary to reduce the weight of the new coins to compensate. If this were the case, the burden on the people would increase, and it would seem contrary to the government's intention to benefit the people by abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan. Therefore, individual opinions were not yet unified. It was decided to continue the discussion at the original location at 2:30 PM on the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>Chen Xingzhi's Remarks: According to committee member Chen Xingzhi, who spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency, today's meeting was entirely of a research nature, so there were no resolutions. All three principles have been carefully studied. Regarding the manufacturing of legal tender, there are proponents of the system of the third year of the Republic and proponents of other systems. Opinions from all sides differ, so detailed research is necessary because the issue is very important.</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng's Letter: The original letter from Liu Hongsheng is translated as follows: "To Mr. Chen Jian'an of the Central Bank, I regret to inform you that I am ill today and unable to attend the meeting of the Abolishing the Tael Committee this afternoon. I would like to briefly state my views on the minting fee. In my opinion, in order to maintain the operation of the mint and cover expenses given today's high prices, the minting fee should not be lower than 2%. The reasons are as follows: (1) The mint should not incur losses due to minting. A minting fee of 2% seems sufficient to cover labor and unforeseen expenses. (2) The mint cannot be sure that it will have work throughout the year. Ample preparation should be made to maintain the operation of the factory. (3) Based on my experience, the actual costs of the factory often exceed its estimated costs. Therefore, with regard to minting, the minting fee should be estimated generously. (4) The mint estimates that it can mint 13 million yuan of silver dollars per month, but according to my estimation, it will be no more than 10 million yuan. In this case, setting the minting fee at 2% is even more necessary. With sincere regards, Liu Hongsheng."</p>
<p>Gerhard's Opinion: The letter from expert Gerhard (i.e., Keimo) to Chen Jian'an regarding the abolition of the tael is translated as follows: "Regarding the three points raised by Minister Song, I was instructed by the committee members at the meeting on July 20 of the 21st year to summarize various relevant points. I have followed the instructions and recorded the key points of the opinions and proposals made by the committee members as follows: (1) Regarding the weight and fineness of the new currency, it has become a unanimous consensus that the new currency should be the sole and universal monetary unit in China's loan system before China changes from the silver standard. In this case, the mixed-color silver coins currently circulating throughout the country should be gradually recalled and recoined. Assuming that the total amount of silver coins in the country is 200 million yuan, the cost of collecting, melting, and recoining these 200 million yuan will be at least 1.25%. The national treasury will inevitably incur an additional expenditure of 25 million yuan. However, the above estimate does not include the transportation costs from remote areas to the Shanghai Mint, nor does it consider the statutory tolerance of 0.5%, which includes both weight and fineness. Although it is undesirable to have it necessarily at the time of the initial issuance of new coins, it cannot be guaranteed that it will not exist in the silver coins currently in circulation. With the above-mentioned circumstances, the lowest cost of implementing the new policy must be compensated. Even if the government authorities do not pay for this, the situation is inevitable. This minimum cost should be around 1.75%. Based on the above reasons, it is proposed to change the weight and fineness of the current circulating currency as follows: current weight 415 grains, current fineness 0.890, proposed new weight 412 grains, proposed new fineness 0.880. Calculated according to the composition of the new proposal, the total weight is 3 grains lower, i.e., 0.723%, and the fineness is 10 lower, i.e., 1.846%, which can compensate for the recoining cost and take into account the aforementioned statutory tolerance. The weight of the new currency should be calculated in grams. If the weight of the new national currency is 412 grains, then it should be expressed as 26.6971 grams in grams. If the fineness is 0.880, then the pure silver it contains should be 23.493448 grams. Assuming that the composition of the new currency is as above, then its true value should contain 0.6992305 Shanghai taels, but the minting cost has not been calculated. The minting cost should be determined by the mint authorities, but it should also depend on the size of the coinage. (2) The exchange rate for silver contracts still in effect. In order to be fair, this exchange rate should be based on the true value of the new national currency. According to the true value of 100 new national coins... Shanghai taels, 69.92305, plus the minting cost, assuming it is 1.5%, Shanghai taels, 1.04884, totaling 70.97189 Shanghai taels. The above calculations are hypothetical for both parties to the silver contract. Ultimately, what rate should the silver contract be based on in order to convert silver into silver coins? The opinions of bankers, industrialists, and merchants should be widely solicited before a decision is made. The resolution of this issue is unlikely to cause any difficulties. (3) What measures should be taken to make society understand and trust this reform? The most important ones are roughly the following: (A) The new national currency should have freedom of transportation between the provinces of China or between China and foreign countries. Since this new currency represents the monetary unit of the Chinese silver standard, before China's currency system changes from the silver standard, neither the new currency nor raw silver with a fineness of less than 0.880 should be prohibited from entering or exiting freely. (B) Freedom of minting. Freedom of minting has one meaning: the Shanghai Mint can exchange the currently circulating currency for new coins at any time, as long as the old coins still retain their original statutory weight and have not been stripped or otherwise damaged. Freedom of minting also has one meaning: the mint can exchange sycee for new coins at any time according to the initially announced conversion rate (a time limit may be added to this exchange to promote the elimination of sycee). Freedom of minting also has one meaning: if someone requests to exchange large bars of silver with a fineness of less than 0.997 for new national coins, the mint can purchase the national coins it should pay at any time and can easily determine it once using the following formula: national currency 1.000 ounce 0.999 fineness, 1 ounce, 480 grains (412 grains 0.880 fineness), 1 national currency, the answer equals foreign currency 1.322.5948. This is a fixed number that will never change. The minting fee should be deducted from this fixed number. (C) Minting silver bars. If the Shanghai Mint can mint silver bars, it will be of great benefit. This silver bar should still have its original fineness of 0.999. Its value, including the copper cost of minting 1000 yuan of silver coins, should be equal to 1000 yuan of national currency. The silver bar should have the mint's seal, number, and the fineness and weight should be marked prominently. This silver bar has two functions: first, for clearing purposes, to avoid counting and identifying silver coins and to facilitate transactions; second, for export purposes when possible. When China still uses the silver standard, the freedom of silver to enter and exit is necessary. This is very similar to the situation in various gold standard countries where gold bars are more important than gold coins. Gold bars have the freedom to be transported in and out. I personally think this point is very important because in this way, various exchange banks can develop their legitimate business. This is also not harmful to the Chinese government but beneficial because the cost of minting a silver bar worth 1000 yuan is much less than the cost of minting one-yuan silver coins worth 1000 yuan. Anyone who holds or buys a silver bar worth 1000 yuan pays the same coinage tax as anyone else, i.e., the minting fee for minting 1000 yuan of silver coins. Compared with the current situation, this method is not painful for exporters. Anyone who wants to transport silver sycee abroad must also pay a coinage tax, the amount of which may not be smaller than the fee charged by the mint because when silver bars become silver sycee, local silver smelters will inevitably charge a fee. (D) Dismantle other mints in China. Since the Shanghai Mint is sufficient to realize the entire reform plan, there will be no need for other mints in China to exist. Their continued existence will be extremely harmful to the progress of currency unification. If countless other mints cannot be stopped from working, the initial stage of the reform plan will inevitably be affected. Merely closing these mints is not enough to guarantee that they will not compete with the Shanghai Mint in the future. Only complete dismantling can guarantee that they will not destroy the true goal of the new plan. (E) Invite representative groups to actively cooperate. It is proposed to invite leaders from the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors to organize a permanent committee to assist the board of directors of the mint. The board of directors can understand everything about the mint authorities' measures and responses. If the board of directors can appoint a well-known mint chemist who is fair enough to guarantee the composition of the new currency, it will greatly benefit the progress of the business and easily create general trust. (F) The sycee reserves should be eliminated immediately. Since the entire plan is closely related to the abolition of the tael, the mint should immediately start recoining the sycee reserves into new coins, then further recoin the large amounts of mixed-color old silver coins, and finally, if necessary, use imported large bars to mint new coins. The above are the points that should be noted. In addition, there may be other points that can be studied, which should be discussed by other relevant parties. Before ending this article, I would like to state that according to my estimate, the total number of silver coins circulating in China is 200 million yuan, while the sycee reserves stored in banks are difficult to exceed 110 million taels. Therefore, even considering the existing silver coins and sycee, the ratio is 92 to 8."</p>
<p>Letter from the Central Mint: The original letter from Wei Jingzhou and Xiao Weide of the Central Mint is translated as follows: "To the Abolishing the Tael Committee, we are writing to inform you that the silver dollar minting fee we have revised is based on minting 10 million yuan per month, with 10 hours of minting per day. The minimum fee must be 2.25% (&amp;225,000). Please refer to the attached estimate. This minting fee should be increased or decreased, and the increase or decrease should be announced. We believe that the Central Mint should retain the right to increase or decrease the minting fee, and the increase or decrease will depend on the amount of coinage and future changes in the weight, fineness, and material prices of silver coins. We wish to state that our estimates do not include any profit. Furthermore, since minting has not yet begun, there is no basis for the current estimate. In order to be cautious, we have specifically revised the calculation of silver loss, combining it with the copper loss. We believe that the silver loss must be based on 2.5 ounces lost per 1000 ounces of silver per month for 12.5 million ounces of silver per month, because minting 10 million yuan of silver coins requires melting 12.5 million ounces of silver, and there will inevitably be 40% to 50% of waste falling off during the molding process, of which only 50% to 60% can be used for minting. This 40% to 50% of waste is still returned to the 'melting department' for remelting into new silver ingots. The copper required for manufacturing silver coins is now revised to 5 jiao per pound. Most of this copper is purchased from overseas, and copper prices and exchange rates fluctuate from time to time, so it must be taken into account in advance. Depreciation and interest on various machines are also included in our calculations, because the equipment for minting machines, engines, etc. was purchased more than ten years ago, and after several years of work, it needs to be replaced, so this depreciation reserve is for the future replacement of new machines. Workers must be trained initially, so the amount of 10 million yuan minted per month cannot be reached immediately. If the amount of coinage is only 50% of the coinage capacity, the monthly income will only be 112,500 yuan. After the mint has reached the point where it can mint fully, whether its monthly income can offset expenses depends entirely on whether the supply of silver for minting silver coins can be continuous. If the supply to the factory is interrupted or insufficient, and therefore it cannot mint as much as possible, the income will also decrease proportionally, and the mint will inevitably suffer losses. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the sufficient and continuous supply of silver, and it is also necessary to plan in advance how to maintain it during periods of suspension and reduction of work. Otherwise, the mint will only have to increase the minting fee according to the minimum amount of coinage. The minting fee we have calculated is not fixed. We hereby declare that this calculation depends entirely on the amount of coinage and the prices of labor and materials. The 2.25% we have estimated is based on the highest amount of coinage. If the silver supplied to the mint by bankers in the future is only 50% of its coinage capacity, the minting fee will naturally have to be increased proportionally. Our goal is to make the mint a self-sufficient factory, like other factories. The most important goal is to mint a national currency with uniform fineness and weight and to train personnel to become an efficient organization. Our goal is to create a skilled organization so that irregular situations do not occur and so that the fineness and weight of the new silver dollar are uniformly reliable. However, we sincerely hope that you will study our estimates in detail and plan for a substantial fund to maintain the operation of the factory, because there must be no mistakes at the beginning of operations. The future of the mint depends entirely on the cooperation of bankers, industrialists, and commercial leaders. Wei Jingzhou and Xiao Weide." Attached: Revised estimate of monthly coinage expenses for the Shanghai Central Mint. Monthly minting of silver dollars: 10,000,000 yuan. Based on minting 4,000,000 yuan per day, 10 hours of minting per day, 25 working days per month. 127. Estimate based on: silver dollar, weight 412 grains, silver 88%, copper 12%.

<h3>Directorate General of Posts Revises Regulations for Mailing Items</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency: After the postal blockade in the Northeast, Huang Naishu, Director General of Posts, has revised the regulations for mailing items. The regulations are as follows: (1) Mail to Russia and Asia will be rerouted via Vladivostok by sea. (2) Mail to Korea (leased territory) will be rerouted via Dalian, Japan. (3) Mail to Europe will be rerouted via the Suez Canal as before. Mail from the three eastern provinces with stamps from the three eastern provinces will be treated as underpaid. Mail with Chinese stamps will not be treated as underpaid. The Directorate General has instructed the Shanghai Administration to comply with the above regulations.</p>
<h3>Illegal Establishment of Post Boxes by Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>First Batch Shipped Out This Morning</p>
<p>Since our country blockaded postal services in the Northeast, Japanese residents in Shanghai immediately established temporary mailboxes to collect and send mail to the Northeast and other locations. Yesterday, they began collecting and delivering letters at the Huangpu Wharf and the Japanese Club. This morning at 9:00 AM, mail processed by the Japanese in Shanghai was shipped out on the Dalian Maru.</p>
<p>Mail Collection Procedures: The temporary post office, jointly established by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Situation Committee, and various federations in Shanghai, has set up a collection point at the Japanese Club in Hongkou. Mailboxes have also been placed at the Huangpu Wharf, and a Japanese person named Suetaro Okajima has been specially assigned to manage this. It is stipulated that registered items, parcels, and express mail will not be accepted for the time being, only ordinary letters. Chinese postage stamps should be affixed. The first collection deadline was 9:00 AM this morning. Afterwards, mail will be collected for one hour starting at 8:00 AM on the days when the Dalian Kisen Kaisha ships depart. If the deadline is missed, it will be delayed by three days until the next ship departs.</p>
<p>No Postage Stamps Affixed: Yesterday, many letters from Japanese merchants and residents in Shanghai destined for the Eastern Provinces were delivered to the Japanese Club and the Huangpu Wharf. However, none of the letters being sent had postage stamps affixed. When reporters inquired with the Japanese about why they were not affixing postage stamps, the Japanese person stated that although the collection point stipulated that Chinese postage stamps could be affixed, since the delivery was being arranged independently by fellow countrymen, there was no need to pay postage to the Chinese post office again. Rather than spending money to buy Chinese postage stamps, they would rather pay the postage due in the Northeast. Therefore, almost all of the letters being sent this time did not have postage stamps affixed.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Refuse to Send: On the 25th and 26th, various foreign firms in this port sent letters destined for the Northeast, Harbin, and Siberia to the Dalian Kisen Kaisha. The president of Dalian Kisen, Shinji Sato, stated that they needed to be redirected to the mailbox at the wharf. The foreign firms took back the original letters, but then worried that entrusting the mail to the Japanese for delivery might lead to disputes, which would be inappropriate. Yesterday, the foreign merchants agreed to continue sending letters to Siberia through the Chinese post office, which would then forward them via Canada. Although this would be slightly delayed by a few days, it would effectively avoid obstructions and complications along the way. As a result, foreign mail has been refused for delivery by the Japanese.</p>
<p>First Batch Shipped Out: The first batch of letters collected by the Japanese temporary post office was due this morning at 9:00 AM. At 9:05 AM, they were packaged and sent aboard the Dalian Maru, to be transported to Dalian Bay. From there, they will be distributed by the South Manchuria Railway to the puppet bureau in Shenyang, and then forwarded to various ports. From 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM this morning, letters destined for the Northeast, Harbin, etc., can still be collected and sent.</p>
<p>Incoming Mail to Shanghai: Regarding the first batch of mail sent from the Northeast to Shanghai and other locations after the puppet state forcibly took over the post office, a telegram was received yesterday stating that it had been loaded onto the Dalian Kisen steamer Fengtian Maru and is expected to arrive at the Huangpu Wharf at 4:30 PM this afternoon. Yesterday, the Japanese residents had already agreed that mail sent from the puppet state would also be collected by the Japanese Club. Letters, parcels, etc., destined for Shanghai would be delivered by coolies hired by the club using bicycles. However, a proper method for forwarding items to various locations in the interior has not yet been agreed upon.</p>
<p>Remittance Procedures: For remittances from Shanghai to various locations in the Northeast, the Japanese residents have reached an agreement with the Hankou Bank to handle the exchanges. Since the Hankou Bank has a temporary contract with the puppet state's post office for postal remittances, the bank can handle exchanges to various locations in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Huang Naishu's Comments: Huang Naishu, the Director of the Postal Bureau, spoke to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency regarding the Japanese establishing a post office. According to his information, the Japanese side does not yet have a clear organization and is simply delivering items via the Dalian Maru. Therefore, this is a matter for the Japanese and does not affect any other party. Furthermore, since Chinese postage stamps are being used, there is no basis for immediate action. If the Japanese side takes xenophobic actions, such as not using Chinese postage stamps or formally establishing a post office, then we will naturally respond according to the law. He is determined not to allow any party to undermine China's postal independence.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Authorities Telegraph Battle Situation in Tibet</h3>
<p>The Sichuan-Kang Army Recaptures Da Jin Temple</p>
<p>Da Jinwa Sets Fire to Da Jin Temple</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government's office in Shanghai received a telegram from the provincial authorities yesterday reporting on the Sichuan-Kang Army's combat operations and requesting that they persuade people from all walks of life to provide assistance. The original telegram is reproduced below: Since our army (Sichuan-Kang Army) launched its campaign to suppress the Tibetan bandits on the first of the month, the enemy has attacked with over 6,000 troops. Our army is deployed in four directions, responding calmly. In winter, we recaptured Snow Mountain Peak, and Jiangriwu occupied Baili. The rebel general Wudai Ben led his troops to retreat and defend Dajing. In this battle, our officers and soldiers bravely charged forward, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, killing thousands of enemies and capturing many prisoners. Our army suffered casualties totaling over 1,400. Brigade Commander Yu Songlin took advantage of the victory to lead his troops in a fierce attack on Dajin, launching a general offensive on the Wu day and recapturing Dajin and Rongbacha. The Tibetan bandits are retreating towards Dege. However, since the start of the campaign, material equipment has been lacking, and the transportation of provisions has been slow. We are relying entirely on a patriotic fervor to fight the Tibetan bandits. We have repeatedly telegraphed the central government requesting replenishment of provisions and arms, but this has not yet been granted. Furthermore, the people of the country pay little attention to the border defense issue. What they do not know is that the Tibetan bandits' reckless actions this time are purely instigated by a certain imperialist power. We hope you will convey this to compatriots at home and abroad and ask for their assistance. (Another telegram) When the Tibetan bandit Da Jinwa withdrew from Da Jin Temple, he set fire to it, causing great damage. The people in the Da Jin Temple and Rongbacha area, who had secretly aided the Tibetan bandits, mostly fled in fear of punishment. Our army commander Deng Pan Cunzhen (on the 11th) went from Da Jin Temple to Rongbacha, providing meticulous reassurance to the people along the way. They are now returning home one after another and resuming their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Association Telegraphs Request for Peace of Mind and Protection of Territory</h3>
<p>Dagon News Agency reports that the National Salvation Association of Various Organizations sent a telegram to the government: To President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, all members of the Military Affairs Commission, Chairman Chiang of Hankou, Commander Dai of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, and Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government: Recently, the people in the North Sichuan Road area have been agitated and are moving away in droves, as if a great disaster is imminent. This is because the Japanese have decided to reoccupy the area of Hongkou where roads have been built beyond the boundary and the area around Baziqiao. They have already brought in many plainclothes policemen, preparing to send troublemakers to create incidents. On the one hand, they will claim that the Chinese police are unable to protect Japanese residents, and on the other hand, they will drive out the Chinese police, dispatch police to set up posts, and implement the occupation. Our people and the government must not ignore these sinister schemes to undermine our territorial sovereignty. Our association has reliable information and dares to urgently telegraph this report, requesting that you quickly order the troops stationed near Songhu to rush to the Zhabei Xiangyin Township area to firmly suppress the situation, so as to reassure the people and protect the territory. We are anxiously awaiting your response. The Shanghai National Salvation Association of Various Organizations, with gratitude.</p>
<h3>Yu and Feixin Confer Again Yesterday on the Case of Roads Built Beyond the Boundary</h3>
<p>Our Side Insists on Not Impairing Sovereignty</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Has Reported to the Consular Body</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the draft agreement on the recovery of roads built beyond the boundary was previously discussed and agreed upon by Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Feixin Dun, Director-General of the Municipal Council. Feixin Dun then submitted it to a special meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors on July 6 for discussion. As a result, several points in the draft were revised, and it was then handed back to Feixin Dun and Secretary-General Yu for further discussion. Secretary-General Yu believed that the revisions contradicted our principle that "the sovereignty over roads built beyond the boundary belongs to the Municipal Government." Therefore, on the 18th, he visited Feixin and refuted the revisions made by the Municipal Council Board of Directors. Feixin agreed to submit them to the next Board of Directors meeting for further discussion. At 10:30 AM yesterday, Feixin visited Secretary-General Yu at the Municipal Government again. He proposed to revise the points corrected by Yu on the 18th in preparation for submitting them to the regular meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors in the afternoon for discussion. Secretary-General Yu stated his reasons for not being able to revise them and reiterated the principle that "the sovereignty over roads built beyond the boundary belongs to the Municipal Government." After an hour of discussion, Feixin left. Furthermore, the Municipal Council's Information Office announced that at yesterday afternoon's meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors, Director-General Feixin Dun reported on the situation of negotiations with representatives of the Municipal Government regarding the agreement on the management of roads outside the boundary. It was then resolved that a copy of the proposed measures would be transcribed and sent to the Consular Body with a letter.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to Resistance to Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Since imported Japanese goods have recently regained their position as number one, as before September 18th, and sales of these goods are very active in the market, it is urgently necessary to find ways to remedy the situation. The status of handling this is explored and recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Summoning Representatives from Various Industries for Discussions: Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, has been summoning representatives from various related industries for discussions over the past few days and earnestly advising them. The representatives from the various industries who attended also advocated for strict measures and assumed responsibility for mutual supervision. The summoning of representatives from various industries was as follows: On the first day, managers from various yarn shops were summoned for discussions, including those from Jiu Shen, Xing Xiang, Xing Sheng, Qiang Mao Ji, Lin Yuan Feng, and Yi Tai Chang.

<p>Reply to the National Salvation Association: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai National Salvation Association of Various Organizations regarding the situation of the resistance to Japanese goods movement, stating: We received your letter of the 23rd of this month, stating that since the end of the Shanghai War, imports of Japanese goods have surpassed all others, and requesting that we maintain our original intention and make continued efforts in the resistance to Japanese goods movement. Since the end of the Shanghai War, our Chamber has been concerned that the resistance to Japanese goods movement would become lax over time. We have constantly admonished and earnestly advised the various industries, expressing our innermost feelings. These have been repeatedly recorded in newspapers, and we believe they are well known to your Association. In addition, we have sent people to secretly investigate, sent warning letters, and invited people to come to the Chamber for face-to-face admonishments. We have done everything within our power to handle the matter sincerely. We will continue to adhere to this principle in the future and find ways to dissuade people at any time to avoid undermining our previous efforts and making the enemy happy. We are responding with this letter for your information.</p>
<h3>Northeast Customs Issue Awaiting Final Decision from the National Government</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Song Did Not Hold a Meeting Before Departure</p>
<p>Yesterday, personnel from the customs authorities denied rumors that Finance Minister Song Ziwen had convened a meeting at the office of the Inspector General of Customs on Hurd Road before his departure. The official also stated that the Ministry of Finance and the customs authorities had formally consulted on the issue and had completely agreed, but the authorities would not publicly release the results of the discussion, leading to much speculation from the outside world. Reports that meetings would be held today or tomorrow are completely inaccurate. What is currently permitted to be publicly released in newspapers is the final decision of the National Government. Once the Ministry of Finance receives instructions from the National Government and hands them over to the Inspector General of Customs, it can officially issue a declaration and implement an order to block customs.</p>
<h3>New International Telecommunications Negotiations</h3>
<p>New Telegraph Circuit Established Between Shenyang and Berlin</p>
<p>International Telecommunications Bureau Telegraphs Ministry of Communications for Instructions</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that during Zhang Zuolin's time in the Northeast, he strived for autonomous international communications. He successively ordered multiple large radio stations from the United States and Germany and signed reporting contracts with a joint US company, the German Ocean Traffic Company, and the French Wireless Company to implement reporting. Business was suspended after the September 18th Incident. In March of this year, the joint US company, citing convenience for merchants, continued the original contract and opened a direct telegraph circuit between Shenyang and the United States. The International Telecommunications Bureau has repeatedly and seriously negotiated, but without effect. Recently, a new circuit has been established between Shenyang and Berlin, and there are rumors that telegraphs will soon be sent from Java and Paris as well. The situation is gradually expanding. The International Telecommunications Bureau urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Communications requesting instructions and expressing its views. The original telegram is presented below: (Omitted salutations) Regarding the issue of the joint US wireless company communicating with the puppet Manchurian state, the Bureau submitted a report on the progress of the negotiations and requested instructions on April the 4th. To date, no approval has been received, leaving the negotiation direction without guidelines. More recently, Germany has resumed telegraphing with Shenyang, and there are also rumors that telegraphs will soon be sent from Java and Paris. The situation is increasingly expanding, making negotiations even more difficult. It is requested that the Ministry of Communications telegraph Director Zhang again to cancel the original reporting contract with the relevant companies, or state that the puppet Manchurian state is not a legitimate successor and cannot continue telegraphing. This should be submitted for public judgment. At the same time, it seems that telegraphing between our national stations in Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Harbin, Changchun, etc., should be stopped to avoid giving foreigners an excuse and to facilitate further serious negotiations with the company. If this is appropriate, please review and indicate your compliance.</p>
<h3>Director-General of the Naval Department, Li Shijia, Departed for Japan Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Ninghai Warship's Outstanding Fees Are to Be Paid in Installments</p>
<p>The construction of the Ninghai warship, which the Navy Department commissioned in Japan, has been completed, but a portion of the shipbuilding costs remains unpaid. Therefore, the warship has not been able to return to the country for the time being. Li Shijia, Director-General of the Naval Department, who supervised the construction of the warship, returned to Beijing from Japan in the middle of this month to discuss the matter with Minister Chen Shaokuan. A solution has now been found. Li boarded the Nagasaki Maru yesterday morning for his first trip to Japan. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Li Shijia and asked him about the results of his discussions with the Navy Department after returning to Beijing. According to him, at a time when the country's finances are extremely strained, the issue of raising funds was quite hesitant for a time, but ignoring it would greatly affect our credibility. However, the amount owed for the warship, apart from what has already been paid, is not very large. It has now been agreed with Minister Chen to temporarily carry two-thirds of the outstanding warship fees to pay in advance. The remaining amount will be communicated to the factory in a letter from the Ministry, requesting that it be remitted within the month after the Ninghai warship sails back to the country. It is expected that this will not be difficult to arrange, and the warship should be able to sail back to the country by the middle of next month.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Northwest Problem Research Association</h3>
<p>First Meeting of the Executive Committee</p>
<p>The Northwest Problem Research Association held its first meeting of the executive committee at the association's office at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those present included Hu Shuhua, Pan Yangyao, Li Dachao, Guo Weiping, Dai Yuzheng, Chen Weixin, and Yin Zhufu. The meeting was chaired by Li Dachao, and the following resolutions were made: (1) To elect Hu Shuhua, Guo Weiping, and Li Dachao as standing committee members; (2) To assign duties to each department, with each department forming a committee in addition to appointing a director; (3) To pass a declaration; (4) To invite Yang Hucheng, Shao Lizi, Deng Binshan, Lu Dachang, Jin Shuren, Lu Xiaozu, Ma Lin, Li Dan, Ma Hongkui, and Sun Weiru (all from the Northwest), and Yu Youren, Shao Yuanchong, Ma Fuxiang, Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Zhu Qinglan, Wu Tiecheng, Ma Xiangbo, Huang Renzhi, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Gongquan, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Xing, Chen Guangfu, Li Fuxun, Wang Zhixin, and Wu Yunqi (all from the central government and Shanghai) and dozens of others as supporting members of the association; (5) The standing committee members are responsible for handling the various motions passed by the general assembly. The declaration of the inaugural meeting and the bylaws of the association are recorded below:</p>
<p>Declaration of the Inaugural Meeting of the Northwest Problem Research Association: The Northeast has fallen, Rehe is under alarm, and the tyrannical sun rages. The people of the country are united in anger. The Northwest Problem Research Association, which has been in preparation for several months, has also been formally established at this heated and tense time, which is truly a cause for joy and celebration. At the beginning of its establishment, we cannot help but briefly mention a few points to inform the people of the country: (1) Awaken the people of the country's sight and hearing. The Northeast, which is of great importance, fell to the invasion of the tyrannical sun on September 18 because the people of the country did not pay attention to it. Today, the Northwest problem is even more important than the Northeast, but the people of the country still do not pay much attention to it. The problem of overpopulation in the Southeast has led to the inability to solve the unemployment problem. The only way to solve this is to reopen new paths and develop the Northwest to avoid the covetousness of foreigners. It is too late for the Northeast, but the Northwest can still be saved. This is a matter of life and death for the people of the country, and it is what our association's colleagues should urgently awaken the people of the country to. (2) Conduct on-site investigations. As the ancients said, "Sitting and talking is not as good as getting up and doing," and "Hearing a hundred times is not as good as seeing once." Since our colleagues have taken on the task of studying the Northwest problem, they should collect as much information as possible for the use of our colleagues' explorations before conducting research. Our association has dispatched chief members Hu Shuhua and Guo Weiping to go to the Northwest to conduct on-site investigations. They plan to investigate Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and even the key passes outside the customs separately and provide the information obtained to our association's colleagues for research at any time. (3) Pay attention to scientific research. The biggest illness in our country is the lack of scientific thinking among the people of the country, which has led to all kinds of undertakings being inferior to others. Backward production and declining industries are a cause for regret if we do not change now. After the establishment of our association, we are willing to devote our full efforts to paying attention to scientific research, cultivating the scientific literacy of the people of the country, developing industries, and promoting production so that the underdeveloped industry of China can emulate Europe and the United States and progress steadily every day. (4) Concentrate talents from home and abroad. Our country today appears on the surface to be overstaffed, but in reality, it is difficult to find talent. Mechanical, electrical, mining, metallurgical, civil engineering, forestry, agricultural reclamation, and other specialists are needed everywhere in the country, especially in border areas. Our association hopes to concentrate these talents to engage in the development of the Northwest, and the unemployed compatriots in the prosperous cities can also have a place to work. In this way, countless unemployed compatriots can all have a way out, which is beneficial to people, to the public, and to the private sector. (5) Assist government plans. Our association's investigation findings and research accumulations will not be kept secret or selfishly. We are extremely willing to contribute them to the government as much as possible, hoping that the government will carry out large-scale construction. Our association's colleagues will forget their limitations and do their best to assist the government in preparing various plans to promote their implementation and achieve immediate results. (6) Introduce overseas compatriots to invest. In recent years, the establishment of domestic enterprises has been most difficult due to the fundraising of capital, and overseas compatriots who want to invest in the country have no suitable industry to operate in. The Northwest region has vast land, rich products, and great potential for various undertakings. Overseas compatriots who care about their motherland will surely be happy to invest to promote the progress of the Northwest's production industry. Our association is willing to take on the responsibility of attracting and introducing them. Our association is willing to carry out the six points mentioned above step by step, providing research for the people of the country on the one hand and providing consultation for the government on the other. We attach equal importance to theory and practice, and combine scholarship with action. Given time, we hope to achieve practical results. Fearing that the road will be difficult and that our strength will be weak, we sincerely hope that comrades at home and abroad who are enthusiastic about the Northwest problem will give us their support and work together to make progress. We look forward to it with the utmost sincerity. We hereby declare this.</p>
<h3>British and American Consuls Visited Mayor Wu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the Addition of Chinese Members to the Land Commission</p>
<p>According to Article 6 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, the Municipal Council's Land Commission is composed of only three Westerners. Recently, due to the increasing number of affairs, a resolution was made at the last meeting of the two taxpayers' meetings to add two Chinese members, which clearly requires amendment to Article 6. At the same time, according to Article 28 of the same Regulations, changes to the Regulations must be approved by the local government. Therefore, at 9:00 AM yesterday, British Consul-General Beilinan and American Consul-General Keyinhhan went to the Municipal Government to seek approval. They were received by Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Secretary-General Yu Hongjun. After the two consuls explained their intentions, Mayor Wu replied that the Municipal Government not only expressed its approval but also considered it extremely necessary. The addition of Chinese members would inevitably lead to a greater fusion of feelings between Chinese and foreign citizens, and cooperation between Chinese and foreigners would inevitably see greater progress. However, the method of selection, whether it will continue to be selected by the taxpayers' meeting in the future, has not yet been determined and requires a detailed discussion before a decision can be made. The two men left at about 10:00 AM.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Held an Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hu Juewen Was Selected to Represent the Inspection of Shaanxi Industries</p>
<p>Committee Formed to Study Accounting Systems for Various Industries</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its third executive committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Those present included Zhu Wenqi, Chen Zheqing, Ma Shaoquan, Zheng Zenan, Pan Xusheng, Yu Zuoting, Wang Yansong, Bei Songsheng, Wang Xiaolai, Ye Jiaxing, Luo Qinghua, Lu Wenshao, and Ma Jiliang. Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Discussion on the case of representatives participating in the Shaanxi Industry Inspection Group. It was resolved to first select Hu Juewen as the representative. Another person will be selected when a suitable candidate is found; (2) Additional members were added to the Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods. It was resolved to add Zhang Yichen and Fang Yexian as members and to send a letter urging Director Chen Songyuan to overcome his difficulties and convene a meeting quickly; (3) Discussion on the case of organizing a research committee to investigate current accounting systems in various industries. It was resolved, in accordance with the proposal of the standing committee, to appoint Fang Jiaobo, Li Wenjie, Yan Chengde, Pei Yunqing, Shen Huachen, Wang Zhixin, and Xu Guanqun as members, with Fang Jiaobo as the convener; (4) Discussion on the petition from the Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Goods Trade Association requesting that the Representative Assembly correct the Municipal Government's announcement on rent reductions. It was resolved that the issue of rent reductions in the city due to the Shanghai War had been studied in detail by the Organization Committee, which believed that, apart from voluntary rent reductions by landlords, it should fall under administrative punishment. The resolution of the Representative Assembly does not have the legal power to correct or restrict the Municipal Government's laws. Regarding rent reductions voluntarily offered by landlords that exceed the amount permitted by the Municipal Government, in accordance with the principle of contractual freedom, they were not originally restricted by the Municipal Government's announcement. However, to avoid misunderstandings, the Chamber should submit another announcement to the Municipal Government for supplementary announcement and send a letter to inform the association.</p>

<h3>City Council Representatives Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Regarding the Request to Correct the Municipal Government's Rent Exemption Standards</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Residents' Association, based on the resolution of the 16th Executive Committee meeting regarding rent reduction and exemption, appointed representatives including Zhang Yichen to petition the capital. Representative Zhang departed for Beijing by night train last night. Here is the submitted petition to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Executive Yuan:</p>
<p>Petition stating that the rent regulations in Shanghai cannot meet the needs of citizens with weak economic capabilities, requesting review and correction. The Shanghai market has been affected by the global economic downturn, the high value of gold and low value of silver, and floods in various provinces, leading to a situation where citizens appear strong but are actually weak. Furthermore, due to the concentration of cash and the decline of Shanghai industries, real estate has become a source of speculation and a shortcut to wealth. As a result of the high land prices and property values, and the small profit margins, rents have been increased repeatedly, followed by forced evictions. The difficulty for Shanghai citizens to reside and operate businesses has become a major and dangerous problem. The exorbitant costs of small rent, key money, and opening fees are difficult to calculate. Last year, during the floods and the Manchurian Incident, small and medium-sized citizens, despite their weak economic capabilities, showed great patriotism and provided substantial disaster relief and support. However, landlords mostly sat back and enjoyed the benefits without contributing a single penny. Historically, the government has issued public bonds and treasury bills, and all industries have been allocated and required to purchase them, but landlords have always managed to avoid them. Since the January 28th Incident, small and medium-sized citizens have participated in strikes, resisted aggression, and worked tirelessly to provide material and economic assistance to wounded soldiers and refugees. However, landlords fled to Hong Kong or their hometowns, locking their doors and making it impossible to obtain even a single cent of assistance from them. Whether or not they are patriotic is their own business, and it is difficult to force them. However, citizens with weak economic capabilities, whose post-disaster commercial income is less than half of what it used to be, have resorted to reducing food intake, clothing, and salaries. The ever-increasing rents, which account for the largest portion of their expenses, must be reduced and exempted in accordance with the actual needs of citizens with weak economic capabilities. Otherwise, their survival is in jeopardy. During times of commercial prosperity, rents increased steadily, and people had to endure it because it was not easy to close down or move. However, during times of commercial decline, landlords should have automatically reduced rents. However, negotiating with them is like seeking skins from a tiger. To rescue the citizens, the municipal government must correct this. Food is a matter of vital importance, and the government has suppressed high rice prices and punished hoarding and speculation. However, rice can be substituted by other things, and clothing varies in price and can be chosen freely. However, housing has become a semi-monopoly, similar to food and clothing, which is inappropriate. If rents do not correspond to the market, then the hard work of small and medium-sized citizens will only benefit the landlords, and the consequences will be dire. Therefore, rent reduction and exemption in Shanghai is necessary to restore vitality. For this reason, representative Zhang Yichen is dispatched, along with the Municipal Government's rent exemption announcement and the rent reduction measures of the Rent Reduction Movement Committee, to respectfully request review and instructions. We earnestly request that you consider the needs of citizens with weak economic capabilities, correct the Shanghai Municipal Government's rent exemption measures, and secure the prosperity of Shanghai and the survival of its citizens. Respectfully presented to President of the Executive Yuan, Wang...</p>
<h3>The Commercial Press Resumes Operations and Employs Personnel</h3>
<p>Primarily Employing Former Employees</p>
<p>The Commercial Press Main Factory, Translation Department, and Oriental Library were previously destroyed by Japanese troops. The shareholder meeting resolved that operations would resume on August 1st. This newspaper has reported this previously. It is now reported that the press is preparing to resume operations, and the issue of personnel employment is of great importance. A special personnel committee has been established to oversee everything to ensure careful consideration. Although the press is permitted to employ 20% new employees according to the group agreement law, the press authorities have decided to primarily employ former employees to take care of former colleagues. Therefore, of the approximately 200 employees hired by the press's general management office and distribution department, almost all of them are former colleagues. After operations resume, if business improves, the old employees will be given priority when additional personnel are needed in these two departments. It is also reported that the press is preparing to restore a considerable printing factory, which will soon be ready. The employment of workers will also primarily focus on former employees.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Military Affairs Re-Wires to Console Commander Dai and Retain Him in His Position</h3>

<h3>War Zone Housing Donations Approved for Offset</h3>
<p>Spring Season Collections Can Offset Autumn Season</p>
<p>The case of tax reduction and exemption in the war zone of this city, the municipal government has previously approved eleven measures and announced them to the citizens of the war zone, so that everyone can be informed. However, there are 8411 households in the war zone that have already collected spring housing donations before the war. The Municipal Bureau of Finance intends to refer to the precedent of exempting barge donations and instruct the original collection office to transfer the amount of spring housing donations that have already been collected, regardless of whether the houses have been destroyed or whether the household registration has been changed, to offset the autumn housing donations, but no refunds will be given. The municipal government requested instructions from the municipal government the day before, and the municipal government believes that the proposed measures are still appropriate and yesterday specifically instructed the bureau to approve them, but only limited to the seven districts of Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinxing, Zhenru, Pengpu, Yinxiang, Zhabei.</p>

<h3>Chinese Female Doctor from the University of Brussels Uses the Opium Prohibition Problem as a Thesis</h3>
<p>Miss Wang Jingqi</p>
<p>Brussels, July 10th communication, the former Chinese Minister to Belgium, the International Opium Prohibition Representative Miss Wang Jingqi, studied at the University of Brussels, and her graduation thesis was on the Chinese opium prohibition problem. At the beginning of the month, she gave a thesis in the University Auditorium, the final test, and public talk debate. There were five examiners, one of whom was Lea Gerard, a member of the Far East Opium Investigation Group two years ago. The debate lasted a long time. One person in the crowd stood up and questioned, saying, "In 1914, I personally saw poppies everywhere in China, which violated the Sino-British Treaty of 1907." Ms. Wang talked eloquently, saying, "At that time, most of them had already been cleared. Otherwise, the British government would have protested according to the treaty. What you saw, sir, may be a small corner of China. I hope you will not use it as an example of the whole." He then yielded. As a result, the examiners unanimously awarded her the highest degree of doctorate. The examiners have already congratulated her and represented the University of Brussels to congratulate her. Ms. Wang has been overseas for a long time, continuing her father's work to promote the country. If she returns to China and sees opium everywhere and the black disaster is rampant, she may not dare to have the courage to speak loudly and be a Chinese debater. It is said that Wang is now going to study in England, and after returning, she will continue to work to reject drugs.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Negotiations Resolved the Chinese Industrial Plant Labor Dispute Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Factory Will Maintain Meals for Three Months While Temporarily Shut Down</p>
<p>The Contract Will Be Signed at the Social Affairs Bureau Today</p>
<p>The Chinese Industrial Plant on Bailinan Road, Shanghai West, has narrowed its business scope and stopped the dispute over the collection and distribution of silk fabrics in two departments.

After a long period of research, it was decided that (1) the two departments of collection and distribution of silk fabrics would temporarily stop working for three months, (2) during the shutdown period, the factory would maintain workers' meals at 6 yuan per month per person, and (3) after the three-month period expires, if the factory is unable to continue opening, the standard of dismissal compensation will be negotiated again.

<h3>The Wu Song Yong'an Labor Dispute: The Labor Union Sent Representatives to Petition Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Cotton Spinning Industry Union of the Eighth District, because the workers of Wu Song Yong'an Spinning Factory, Shen Yongming and other eight people, were acquitted by the court, the prosecutor who handled the case at that time, because he did not accept the verdict, had to appeal, so he was not allowed to post bail, which led to the death of worker Shen Fugeng in prison. Also, because the factory violated government orders and refused to allow the original workers to work in the factory, yesterday, representatives Wang Tingxi, Wang Yuncheng, Zhao Rongsheng, and others sent more than a dozen people to the local court, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Party Department to petition, first to the Municipal Party Department, where they were received by Wang Manyun, Director of the People's Training Section. The representatives stated their intentions. Later, Wang replied that the headquarters would do its best to rescue the detained workers. As for the unemployed workers who were rejected by the factory, the headquarters would send personnel to negotiate with the factory together with the Social Affairs Bureau. The representatives then left and went to the local court to request the release of the detained workers, and Wang Daozhou, the chief clerk, replied that the court attached great importance to this case. After the last petition to the court, the judge was immediately notified to expedite the conclusion. Now that it has been acquitted, it has been sent to the prosecutor for disposal, and the court has no right to advise. Then he went to the Procuratorate and asked to release the detained workers. Prosecutor Chen replied that he had forwarded the intention to the original prosecutor for expedited disposal. The representatives then left and went to the Social Affairs Bureau to meet Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section, and stated that all the workers had been oppressed by the capital after the war and refused to work. Thousands of workers had no food and shelter, and the bureau had already ordered the capital to protect the jobs of the original workers. However, the capital dared to violate government orders and implement its means of oppressing labor. Then Director Wang replied that the bureau would decide on an effective method in the shortest time to solve this dispute as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Appeals from the Fresh Frozen Fish Industry</h3>
<p>There is a Rumor of the Revival of Fish Tax</p>
<p>The Fresh Frozen Fish Industry Association's letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce says: "Dear Sir, recently, fish merchants from Ningbo and Taizhou have been inquiring with our association, saying that there are recent rumors that there is a news of the re-imposition of fish tax, which seems to be well-founded. If it is realized, the fishermen's chance of survival will be cut off. Please help us to appeal." The fish shops under the association are also closely related and pay close attention to this matter. The rumor is spreading like wildfire. On March 28 last year, the National Government ordered that China's fishing industry is declining. If it is not actively promoted and properly protected, it will not be enough to save it and revitalize it. Therefore, all fish taxes and fishing taxes are exempted, and no agency shall establish other items to collect this tax in order to comply with the government's intention to eliminate disturbances and maintain the fishing industry. After receiving the order, the fishermen of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were grateful and said that there was hope for their livelihood. Unexpectedly, after only one year, there was a rumor of the revival of the fish tax. Woe is me, the common people, running around to tell each other, I really don't know where to start. The National Government issued a clear order to save and revitalize the fishing industry, and all fish taxes and fishing taxes were exempted, and it was repeatedly clarified that no agency shall establish other items to collect this tax. According to our normal reason, we think that we can maintain this guarantee permanently. Now the decline of the fishing industry is as old as ever. Is it said that it has been saved? Is it revitalized? No one can answer this. The government will show great faith to the people, or it will not be as changeable as the rumors say. Only the fishermen are on the verge of bankruptcy. The fishermen are exhausted inside and out, and they are no longer able to bear the pressure. Hearing this rumor, they are extremely frightened. In addition to sending a telegram to Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, please preside over the situation. We also send a special letter to your association, asking you to consider the pain of the fish merchants and fishermen, and quickly forward it to save them. We are deeply grateful."</p>

<h3>Cai Tingkai Donates to Wongan Hall</h3>
<p>The owner of Wongan Hall, a Singaporean overseas Chinese businessman, strongly supported the Nineteenth Route Army's resistance against Japan. Cai Tingkai, the commander of the army, wrote four characters, "Good Medicine to Help the World," as a reward. It is now reported that Commander Cai believes that these four characters are not enough to express his meaning, so he wrote another article detailing the four famous medicines to express his gratitude. The article reads, "Mr. Hu Wenhu, the owner of Wongan Hall, is enthusiastic about saving the country and is kind to people. The Tiger Balm, Bagua Dan, Headache Powder, and Qingkuai Water that he has produced have been effective in treating diseases and have long been popular in China. The people are all in agreement. During the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai, Mr. Hu provided the strongest assistance to our army, sharing the same hatred and making people feel excited. I write this to leave a souvenir, Cai Tingkai." This article was sent to Shanghai yesterday by Zou Minchu, a giant gentleman of Guangdong and the former Director of the Department of Finance of Guangdong, who was traveling in Hong Kong. It is also reported that the four major medicines of the hall have been sold out due to the needs of the society in recent days. A large number of new goods will arrive in Shen within one or two days.</p>

<h3>Scope of Amnesty and Commutation</h3>
<p>There are Regulations That Cannot Be Accommodated</p>
<p>Family Members of Criminals Are Fortunate Not to Be Deceived</p>
<p>Shen Jiayi, the president of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, said that he is currently handling the amnesty, and he is deeply afraid that some people outside will take advantage of this incident to defraud the family members of general criminals. Therefore, he issued an announcement yesterday to inform the public. The announcement is copied as follows:</p>
<p>Announcement Regarding the announcement, the National Government promulgated the Amnesty Ordinance on June 24. The provisions on the scope of commutation are very clear. This court and the Special District Court are complying with the order. However, I am afraid that the people do not know all the details, or are fooled by others, resulting in fraud. The provisions of Article 2 of the Amnesty Ordinance are hereby announced so that the public can be informed. That is, those who committed crimes before March 5 of this year, who do not fall within the various crimes listed in that article, will naturally be commuted. If they are crimes listed in that article, they will not be commuted. The period of commutation is also stipulated by the ordinance and cannot be accommodated in the slightest. If anyone says that they can dredge up the court for commutation, it is purely fraud and extortion. They should immediately report to the Special District Court or report them. Do not misunderstand yourself. This announcement, Article 2 of the Amnesty Ordinance, in addition to those who are pardoned in accordance with the preceding article, those who commit other crimes, the most serious principal punishment for which is death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for a term of seven years or more, the sentence is commuted by one-third, and those who are less than seven years, the sentence is commuted by one-half. However, the following crimes are not commuted: (1) those who commit treason, (2) those who kill direct ascendants, (3) those who kill out of premeditation or have cruel acts, (4) those who rob, rob, or pirate and intentionally kill, (5) those who rob, pirate, or set fire and rape, (6) those who kidnap for ransom and intentionally kill the victim or rape them, (7) those who rape and intentionally kill the victim, (8) those who transfer the abducted or lured out of the territory of the Republic of China, (9) those who commit dereliction of duty or embezzlement of public funds, (10) those who commit crimes stipulated in special criminal laws and regulations that are of the same nature as the above articles.</p>
<h3>Zealous Youth Warns Cotton Cloth Industry</h3>

<h3>First Special Court Continues Hearing of Wenying's Tragic Death Case</h3>
<p>Wenying's Mother Arrives at Court Injured</p>
<p>Fan Hongsheng's Testimony Evasive</p>
<p>Lawyer Claims Da Tan is Mentally Ill</p>
<p>Diaoyu Ke Granted Bail</p>
<p>After the female physiognomist Wang Wenying was murdered, Hua Detective You A'gen, Su Changsheng, and Detective Zhao Ziren from the Zhabei Police Station arrested the principal culprit, Fan Hongsheng (also known as Fan Ruibao). Wang's teacher, Diaoyu Ke (i.e., Cheng Meixian), was also suspected and arrested by Detective You, and the details of their arraignment by the First Special Court have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Division opened a court session to continue the interrogation. Fan was defended by Lawyer Jiang Baoli. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station presented the case, stating that after investigation, Cheng Meixian had no special relationship and should not be prosecuted, requesting his release. Wang Wenying's mother, Wang Wu, although discharged from the hospital, was not fully recovered and arrived at court injured to request questioning. Wang Wu gave her statement, speaking in the Hangzhou dialect, making it difficult to understand what she said. A slightly clearer account of her statement is recorded below: she stated that she was 54 years old, from Hangzhou, and Wenying was her biological daughter. At the age of 13, Cheng Meixian took her to Shanghai to study under the female physiognomist Ling Qing, but the art of physiognomy was entirely taught by Cheng. The following year, Cheng deflowered her daughter, and they have been living together as lovers for four years. A month ago, Cheng brought Fan Hongsheng to her house, introducing him to her daughter. On the 15th of this month (lunar calendar), Fan Hongsheng came to Wenying and said that Cheng Meixian had introduced him to her as a husband. Wenying replied that marriage was a major event and she had to agree, and Cheng Meixian could not interfere. On the 16th at noon, Fan again brought two copies of the Shen Bao newspaper, wrapped around a sharp blade. He brought the blade to Wenying to look at, saying he had to take it home. Wenying told him that if the police found it, he would be sent to court and investigated, so he should be careful. Fan then went outside, and she found his behavior suspicious. She followed him and saw Fan enter the New World Hotel (where Cheng's photography studio was located). Returning home, she blamed her daughter for associating with such people and asked her not to eat opium, as it was dangerous. That afternoon, Fan came again, saying he had been to Cheng Meixian's place, and Cheng agreed to give Wenying to him as a wife, telling Wenying, "You must break away from your mother, so she doesn't need to be consulted." Cheng also gave him 500 yuan, instructing him to kill her mother. If he could achieve the goal, then she would surely give him Wenying as his wife. Because she opposed it, Fan took out a sharp blade from his pocket, with a red string on the handle, and slashed her three times. Wenying, seeing this, shouted for the police and kept saying, "I must find you." Fan then killed Wenying. According to her estimation, if she had allowed her daughter to marry him, she would not have been injured. Fan's lawyer, Jiang Baoli, questioned her, asking if Fan appeared crazy when he came. She replied that he was quite clear-headed and handsome. The court then questioned Fan Hongsheng, who testified that he did not know Cheng Meixian, and only met him once. His affair with Wenying was not introduced by Cheng. He had a wife, but they divorced due to disagreements. He then had an affair with a woman who frequented a certain opium den in Qinghefang. A month ago, he went to the opium den to look for his mistress but did not find her. Wenying was eating red pills and was very sociable. Seeing him, she asked his name and occupation and invited him to eat four corners of red pills. She said that because her mother forced her to be a prostitute, she did not want to go home and was staying in room 225 of the New World Hotel, but did not say she was a female physiognomist. Two days later, Wenying opened rooms 11 and 12 at the Yadong Hotel and went there with him. They had a good conversation and became intimate that evening, staying together for seven days. During these seven days, Wenying never went home. Afterwards, every one or two days, they would open a hotel room, always using Yadong as their meeting place. His feelings for Wenying were very strong, and there was no hatred between them. On the day she moved to Pingle Lane, she gave him ten yuan, asking him to buy teapots and other things. Recently, a certain Mr. Jia, acquainted with the prostitute Lao Si, wanted to open a gambling table. Because Wenying was familiar with Lao Si, he went to her on the day of the incident, asking her to intercede with Lao Si for a position at the gambling table. He went a total of six times. The second time he went, she gave him five yuan, ordering him to eat at a Western restaurant. The fourth time he went, he saw a man named Cheng Wenqin in Western attire. Wenying was not killed by him. When she was killed, he was taking a bath at the Longquan Bathhouse. The court did not believe him and could investigate. Detective Su testified that he had gone to Longquan to investigate, and the tea attendant said that Fan had come at 2 PM on the afternoon of the incident and left after a while, while the incident occurred at 3:30 PM in the afternoon. The Wang family's maid, Chen A'jin, and the driver, Pan Changfu, also testified (details omitted, as reported in this newspaper). At this point, Lawyer Jiang claimed that the defendant, Fan Hongsheng, suffered from mental illness. Last year, his family sent him to the Xin Puyu Hall in the South City for treatment. He bit through the iron chain and escaped to Nanjing. His brother caught him and sent him back to the hall, but he soon escaped again and went to Suzhou, where a colleague, a station employee, sent him to the Gospel Hospital a month ago. He had another episode. According to criminal law, those who have lost their minds are exempt from punishment. However, the symptoms of mental loss are sometimes no different from normal people, and their memory is quite intact. Even the murderer who killed the French president did not show any signs of mental illness in court. The judge still felt it necessary to conduct an evaluation, so he requested the court to postpone the hearing for two weeks, allowing his lawyer to collect evidence to prove that the defendant had a mental illness and submit it to the court. He also requested the court to send the defendant to a psychiatrist for evaluation to determine whether the defendant should be held responsible. Lawyer Ru of the police station stated that since the defendant had evidence to prove his mental illness, he did not object to the request for postponement of the prosecution. Judge Feng then ordered the case to be postponed for two weeks and then heard again. Cheng Meixian was released on bail pending summons, and Fan Hongsheng was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Actively Proceeding with Seaside Bathing Beach</h3>
<p>City Government Orders Compliance by Health and Other Bureaus</p>
<p>The seaside beach in the Gaoqiao district of this city has been a freely chosen swimming spot for Shanghai citizens and foreigners who enjoy swimming. However, the Public Works Bureau of this city believes that Shanghai residents urgently need a large-scale bathing beach in the summer, so it plans to develop the original site into a seaside bathing beach to meet actual needs. It was originally planned to add detailed equipment this summer, but due to the exhaustion of municipal funds, it could not be realized. A contingency plan for this year was temporarily devised and submitted to the municipal government for approval. The bureau had previously received Instruction No. 1661 from the municipal government, approving a trial run, and ordering compliance by the Public Security, Health, Public Works, and other bureaus. Therefore, the bureau has begun to implement it, striving to realize the contingency plan. The "Emergency Plan for Opening the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach This Year" is recorded below: (1) "Demarcation of Scope": It is planned to demarcate the entire sandy beach outside the Yu Zihao Pond near the Dragon King Temple in Gaoqiao as the seaside bathing beach area, placing wooden stakes at both ends and connecting them with lead wire as a boundary. The area within the boundary will be exclusively operated and arranged by the municipal government. Other areas must not be enclosed to avoid disputes and confusion. (2) "Life-Saving Equipment": Eight wooden stakes with water level marks will be erected at a depth of one meter and thirty-five centimeters at low tide, and red flags will be raised on them to mark the boundary between deep and shallow water, so that those who are not good at deep swimming will be warned. A lifeboat will also be stationed next to the stakes, painted red, with lifebuoys and life ropes on board for emergencies. (One lifeboat will be temporarily borrowed by this bureau.) (3) "Changing Equipment": Eighty changing rooms, each with a male and female toilet, will be installed on the grass outside the pond. Each door will have a lock and key, and a person will be specially assigned to manage it, so that bathers can change clothes and store their clothes and belongings. Each small room will be nine meters by one or two meters, enough for three or four people to use. "(4) "Rest Area": Fine sand will be laid on a suitable location on the grass-covered beach. Eight or nine sunshades, twenty canvas chairs, and eight small coffee tables will be placed for bathers to sit and rest after bathing. (5) "Cold Drink Equipment": A large wine stall with twelve meters and a small kitchen with about three by six meters will be built. The pillars and frames will be made of foreign pine, and the tops and four walls will be made of canvas so that they can be disassembled when not in use. Tables, chairs, and utensils will also be provided for the sale of beverages.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Congestion Reduction Plan</h3>
<p>Adding Twenty-Seven Vehicles</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the Public Bus Company of the Public Concession submitted to the Public Works Department that it would add 50 vehicles at the beginning of this year to reduce congestion. This proposal was approved by the Public Works Department and announced. If the company could devise a method to prevent congestion on the upper level of double-decker vehicles, the Public Works Department could allow double-decker vehicles to run on certain roads. At the Public Utilities Committee meeting on the 14th of this month, the General Manager reported that the company had increased by 27 new vehicles and that the total number of passengers had decreased by about 30-40%. As for the double-decker vehicles, the company intends to request a temporary postponement of the discussion until the company's expert consultants and the Public Works Department can first consult in London or test run one vehicle. After consideration, the committee found that the increase in vehicles was satisfactory, and it was feasible to postpone the implementation of double-decker vehicles pending discussion and testing. This decision of the committee was approved by the board of directors yesterday.</p>
<p>The company also sent a letter to the Public Utilities Committee, stating that it was difficult to say the results of the implementation of the one-price system, as the driving procedures had changed a lot since January 28th, and it was only gradually returning to normal. It was also claimed that the company was testing a kind of revolving machine to completely prevent "fare evasion" and will adopt the one-price system as a long-term measure in the future. After reviewing the matter, the committee requested the General Manager to inform the company and to report on the one-price system and the effects of the test revolving machine in the future. This proposal was also approved by the board of directors.</p>
<h3>Police Officer from the Shenjiahang Precinct Assaults a Platoon Leader of the Defense Corps</h3>
<p>Arousing Public Outrage Among Merchants and Residents</p>
<p>Leading to a Strike</p>
<p>At the Shenjiahang Township near the city center, a police officer assaulted Wang Shisan, a platoon leader of the Defense Corps, at 4:00 PM on the previous day (the 26th), causing serious injuries. This aroused public outrage among merchants and residents, leading to a strike. It is said that the incident was caused by a villager playing the erhu (Chinese violin) to cool off in front of the Chipeide Pharmacy in Dongshi at 9:00 PM on the 24th. A police officer from Post No. 4769 of the Second Precinct of the Seventh District came forward to interfere. The villager argued that playing the erhu was not against the prohibited activities, leading to a conflict. Lu Shengxian, a shop assistant from the pharmacy, stepped forward to mediate, saying that playing the erhu was a form of entertainment. Unexpectedly, the police officer became angry with Lu, tore his shirt, and blew his whistle wildly. Merchants, residents, and members of the Defense Corps arrived to disperse the crowd. Afterwards, Lu reported the incident to the Second Precinct. The precinct chief, Yao Benyuan, was out on business, so the inspector briefly inquired about the situation and ordered Lu to leave without reprimanding the police officer. After Yao learned of this, he invited Wang Shisan, the platoon leader of the Defense Corps' branch defense station stationed in Shenjiahang, to the station for a face-to-face inquiry. Wang explained the situation in detail. Chief Yao then disciplined Officer No. 4769 by striking his palm twenty times as a warning. The officer, after being disciplined, not only did not know to repent but harbored resentment against Wang, intending to retaliate. He gathered four or five colleagues and waited with wooden sticks at the stone bridge in front of the station. When Wang said goodbye and left, walking to the bridge, the officers stepped forward, grabbed him, and beat him, causing Wang to be seriously injured. He shouted for help, and the townspeople rushed to the scene. The officers then scattered, but Wang had already fallen to the ground with serious injuries. He was helped up, sent to the Defense Corps headquarters, and then transferred to the Nanyang Hospital in this city for treatment. The merchants and residents of the town, seeing the officers acting so recklessly and unreasonably, assaulting an important official of the Defense Corps, were immediately outraged and went on strike. On one hand, the Defense Corps reported to the Defense Corps Management Committee, requesting investigation. On the other hand, they submitted a report to the municipal government and Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau, requesting strict investigation of the troublemaking officer to maintain local security.</p>
<h3>Egg Industry Association Telegraphs Request for Investigation of Anhui Egg Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Egg Industry Association has reported that the Anhui Egg Tax Bureau was abolished by the Ministry's order, but the tax bureau still exists and continues to collect taxes, which is in violation of the central government's orders and oppression of merchants. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to the National Government's Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance, stating, "To the esteemed Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: We have just received a telegram from the Anhui Huaining County Egg Industry Association, stating that the egg tax bureau has been abolished by the Ministry's order, and the special business tax has also been resolved to be suspended by the provincial government, but the bureau continues to collect taxes, which is unreasonable. We request the Finance Department to instruct us to investigate the egg tax in this province in accordance with Article 18 of the Ministry of Finance's revised regulations for the collection of business tax in this province. The short-term business tax should be collected. Before the special tax was handled, merchants were recruited to manage the bureau and collect taxes in June of last year. The tax rate was set at four cents per basket, which was originally stated in the regulations that egg merchants would be taxed at a rate of 20/1000 of their capital. The bureau has been collecting taxes at this rate. Now that the special tax has been suspended, the egg tax bureau continues to operate as usual and has reported to the Ministry and telegraphed instructions to that effect. Now, according to the previous situation, we must follow the instructions to urge all egg merchants to pay the taxes owed as soon as possible and not delay any further. We have repeatedly reported that the special business tax in Anhui Province was abolished by the Yuanbu order, and the egg tax bureau has also been repeatedly ordered to be abolished. On July 12 of this year, the provincial government again resolved to suspend the special business tax. The egg tax bureau has no possibility of existing. Now, the Finance Department is still setting up a bureau to collect taxes, continuing its policy of harming merchants and harming the people. We are deeply alarmed and ask for a unified resistance to solve the problem. On this basis, the egg industry is also a general business, and the business tax does not seem to need to be collected independently. In the past, it was handled by the Anhui Business Tax Collection Office in various districts. After the special business tax was implemented, it was listed as one of the eight types. Now that the special business tax has been abolished, the egg tax bureau has no reason to exist independently. Moreover, the business tax law stipulates that there is a clear distinction between business turnover and capital amount. The Finance Department deliberately calls a deer a horse, forcibly naming the value of goods as capital and levying special heavy taxes. At present, the value of each basket of Anhui eggs is 10 yuan, then the tax of 4 cents per basket reaches 40/1000, which exceeds the 2/1000 stipulated by the Anhui Provincial Business Tax Regulations by 20 times. Such harsh taxes have never been seen before. It is also said that the egg tax in this province was recruited to manage the bureau and collect taxes in June of last year. I do not know according to which laws and regulations. It is clear that the Anhui Finance Department has resumed the Lijin. This kind of contempt for the orders to abolish the Lijin has no knowledge of the Central Government. We should ask the Yuanbu to investigate strictly to respect the officialdom and re-emphasize the merit order. To be in urgent anticipation of the order, the Shanghai Egg Industry Association."</p>
<h3>Movie Star Supports Thrift Movement</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a place of extravagant customs, especially among women. The All-Zhejiang Association of this city is soliciting members, regardless of class or gender, but with the promise of practicing thrift, which is a good remedy for saving the times. Movie star Chen Yumei greatly supports this move. She sent a letter yesterday expressing her support and willingness to take responsibility for solicitation. The original letter is recorded below: "To Mr. Huiseng, Zhufu, and Xiaolai: I am writing to inform you that I have read in the newspaper that your association is advocating a thrift movement and soliciting members, hoping to reverse the decline. After reading it, I was filled with admiration. In recent times, the habit of extravagance has become more and more serious, and the economic decline is not without reason. Yumei is in the film industry and witnesses the difficulties of the times, and is extremely worried. She is promoting frugality as a pioneer in the film industry and informing women across the country to practice thrift and eliminate extravagance. Now, your association's move has won my heart. Yumei is originally from Wujin, and her husband is from Zhejiang. For this reason, I am writing to request the association's rules, hoping that you will grant me a copy so that I can do my best to contribute to this good cause. I wish you all the best. Chen Yumei." The association has sent a letter appointing her as the captain of the solicitation team.</p>

<p>A Rare and Admirable Deed in These Decadent Times</p>
<p>People from Jiangbei Should Not All Be Judged the Same</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 5 o'clock, a rickshaw puller reported to the Third Precinct of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, claiming to be Yuan Jilang, a 19-year-old from Jiangbei, residing in Yaoyuju Alley inside Xiaonanmen in the Nanshi area. He stated that while pulling his rickshaw the previous evening around 8 o'clock near Xiaotaoyuan on Xicang Bridge, a man appearing to be in his thirties hired his rickshaw. Upon reaching Guangfu Temple, the man wanted to go to Beijing Road and Henan Road in the British Concession. Because his rickshaw did not have a Concession permit, he paid the rickshaw fare and then switched to a rickshaw with a Concession permit. Unexpectedly, in his haste when changing rickshaws, the man inadvertently left a leather wallet on his rickshaw, containing fifteen yuan in banknotes and stock certificates. After discovering this, the man and the rickshaw were nowhere to be found, making it impossible for him to return the items. However, he felt that these items did not belong to him and that he should not take unjust wealth. Therefore, he brought the original items to the bureau today, requesting instructions. After presenting the wallet, Director Jin praised Yuan for his honesty in returning the found money, deeming it commendable. He decided to temporarily keep the items at the bureau, awaiting the owner to come forward with proof of ownership.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the Jiyi Benevolent Society's Plague Hospital</h3>
<p>The Jiyi Benevolent Society's plague hospital, located on Tangshan Road in Hongkou, has been in operation for just over a month. However, it has already seen over 13,000 outpatients. The weather was unusually hot last week, and the hospital's outpatient services were particularly crowded. According to its weekly report, there were 3,554 outpatients, 262 cases of true cholera, and 22 cases of heatstroke. The outcomes were generally good, with 201 patients recovering and being discharged, and 5 patients succumbing without being saved. The spacious wards are already filled to capacity. The hospital is located adjacent to the war zone, and in an area where workers and commoners reside. Although this is a major factor in the busy clinical services, its comprehensive facilities, spacious buildings, experienced medical staff, and conscientious staff are not easily found in other plague hospitals. Therefore, many plague-stricken residents from the western and southern districts of the city travel long distances for treatment, further increasing the hospital's workload. It is now learned that the hospital's directors, anticipating the approach of autumn and fearing that the epidemic will spread even more severely, are actively planning to expand the facilities to strengthen the epidemic prevention efforts and will not establish separate branches in order to maintain focus.</p>

<h3>Forcing Oneself to Be a Daughter-in-Law and the Issue of Chastity</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Although the issue of chastity is fundamentally untenable in the modern trend, there are no explicit legal restrictions on women maintaining chastity, because chastity is a moral issue and not a legal one.</p>
<p>The case of Ma Baolin, a student at Suzhou County Middle School, and his fiancée, Xu Caizhen, a female vocational student, both taking poison has occurred. Ma died from the poison, while Xu was saved by medical treatment. Subsequently, Xu, as the fiancée, requested to observe chastity for Ma, but Ma's family firmly refused. Xu Caizhen then engaged in a physical altercation with Ma's stepmother, Zhang, each sustaining minor injuries, leading to a lawsuit. Xu Caizhen's willingness to observe chastity for Ma Baolin as his fiancée in this world of "shifting allegiances" and "every man for himself" can be seen as an attempt to correct the shallow customs and encourage virtuous practices.</p>
<p>However, it is not fashionable. Furthermore, being a martyr is easy, but being a chaste widow is difficult. A martyr is simply driven by momentary passion, reckless of personal safety, either taking poison or cutting one's throat, which is relatively easy to do. But a chaste widow requires a state of mind where "my heart is like an ancient well, and no waves will ever rise," which is extremely difficult to achieve. Being young and with one's will not yet firmly decided, the environment can easily tempt and shake one's heart. Enduring hardship and swallowing bitterness is not human. It was easier to maintain chastity in the past than it is now. In the past, women did not leave their homes, and there were fewer temptations from adverse environments. Now, with open social interactions, those who do not become disordered when they do not see something desirable may not be so when they do see something desirable. Rather than having a good beginning and a poor ending, why bother?</p>
<p>In the past, unmarried women would hold memorial tablets and perform the role of a relative for their deceased fiancés. However, such inhumane actions are unbearable and were viewed as excessive even at the time. Since they were unmarried, they had not fully acquired the status of a wife, so observing chastity was unnecessary. Xu Caizhen's lack of obligation to observe chastity is even more obvious. Even if her request were reluctantly granted after Ma's family refused, how could she live a peaceful life? Furthermore, their son chose to take his own life due to her rebuke, so how could his daughter-in-law live in peace with them for long? It is unlikely. Going a step further, if she wants to observe chastity, there is no need to go through the door. She can simply remain unmarried at home and vow never to marry for the rest of her life, which would be sufficient to face her deceased fiancé in the afterlife. Why go through the door before claiming to observe chastity?</p>
<p>In this case of an unmarried couple taking poison together, the reason for taking poison is perhaps not just because of the stepmother's rebuke, but perhaps there are other reasons, although this is still unknown. If the unmarried couple did not experience other forms of abuse from the stepmother, and only died because of a rebuke, then their death can be said to be without reason. If the stepmother was usually harsh and difficult to live with, making them prefer to die, then why would Xu Caizhen insist on going through the door to observe chastity? These contradictory reasons are truly incomprehensible!</p>

<h3>Method of Making Mirrors</h3>
<p>— Lü Ziwei</p>
<p>The procedure for making mirrors can be divided into four sections: (A) materials, (B) liquid preparation, (C) silvering, and (D) finishing.</p>
<p>(A) The most suitable glass for making mirrors is glass about two or three tenths of an inch thick. Choose glass that is free of air bubbles and flat. Potassium glass is best. First, wash it with ammonia water or sodium carbonate water to remove oil stains, then wipe it clean with a wet cloth in water, and finally wash it with distilled water.</p>
<p>(B) Silvering liquids use potassium sodium tartrate, tartaric acid, or fructose. Tartaric acid is the most suitable. The method is to first prepare two liquids, A and B. Liquid A is made by dissolving one mace of neutral silver nitrate in ten liang of water (1% concentration). Then, gradually add ammonia water to precipitate it. Filter to remove dirt and place it in a bottle. Keep the bottle in a dark place for up to a week. Liquid B is made by dissolving two fen of silver nitrate in ten liang of boiling water. Add 1.66 fen of potassium sodium tartrate to make a tea-colored solution. While it is still hot, put it into a bottle and strain to remove residue.</p>
<p>(C) Remove the glass from the water and wipe it dry with a dry cloth. Mix equal amounts of liquids A and B and quickly pour them onto the surface of the glass. Use chopsticks to spread it across the entire surface. It will turn from rose color to red to dark, and in about 30 minutes, it will become a beautiful golden light.</p>
<p>(D) After the silver plating above dries, gently apply imitation lacquer to make it resistant to friction. Then, apply varnish, and then it is complete, becoming a useful mirror.</p>

<h3>My Opinion on "Improving the Marriage System"</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhang Dingming's "Suggestions for Improving the Marriage System" in this publication, I feel the need to speak. However, for the sake of convenience of publication, I can only briefly and concretely state my views below.</p>
<p>First, we must study the economic relationship of the Chinese marriage system.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that all social phenomena cannot exist without economic relations. Because there must first be a certain form of economic foundation, and then there will be certain forms of phenomena corresponding to it. Needless to say, China's modern economy is entirely a private system. Not only that, but it is also deeply mired in semi-feudalism. That is to say, China's economy, under the pressure of imperialism, does not have the possibility of fully embarking on the path of capitalism, although some major cities have capitalist forms. Under this keynote, the feudal and private household economy is individually seized by the heads of households. Of course, the individual heads of households therefore have absolute authority in the family, and their relationship with their children is entirely one of domination and subordination. Everything of the dominated and enslaved children cannot escape the shackles of the head of the household who holds all the economy. Of course, the marriage of the children cannot be an exception. Then this illustrates the origin of marriage systems such as "parents' orders" and "matchmaker's words." For example, using children's marriages as rewards for official careers, or turning children's marriages into commodities and trading them with those who are beneficial to oneself can be found fully exemplified in modern Chinese society. Regarding this point, Mr. Zhang has explained in detail the "evils of the old marriage system," so I will not repeat them. The above is only to explain the reasons why it is so.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in the modern economic system where people eat people, if we want to reform the marriage system, which is one of the deformed phenomena, I think that no matter how detailed the plan is, the result will only be "improvement"; and even just an ideal that cannot be realized in reality.</p>
<p>"The marriage standard of the era should not be mixed with material ... conditions." That's right, being "prudent in the beginning" may "not lead to painful results," but in this feudal and capitalist "deformed society," everything has its material conditions, especially Chinese women who have never had economic status. Can they rely on marriage to obtain material needs from their husbands? Even considering women in Shanghai, which is full of capitalism, how many are able to live independently without seeking help from their husbands? Conversely, Chinese women are always transferred to the ties of their husbands under the state of parental rewards or transactions. This is a huge "material conditions" problem. Needless to say, this issue has not been resolved in the slightest with the great revolution. Even after fully "examining" or "investigating," or "experimenting" and "understanding" the "character," "academic ability," "love power," and "family situation," can their love not change along with the inevitable changes in material conditions?</p>
<p>Therefore, the marriage system problem is always a branch of the economic problem, and the economic problem must be resolved with a thorough revolution. The prerequisites for China have not been resolved. The "marriage system" of its branch problems, no matter to what extent it is "improved," is at most just "improvement."</p>
<p>As for if the prerequisite problem has been thoroughly resolved, that is, the economic form is no longer feudal or capitalistic, then marriage is no longer bound by material conditions, and of course, there is no need for any form to restrict it. Cohabitation is possible when love matures, because organic love is by no means something that can be restricted.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that this point of view can arouse widespread and heated discussion.</p>
<h3>Park Night</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>This seductive park night was originally the paradise of old students during my student days. When I embarked on the path of life, all the youth life was subdued by the cry of bread. Parks, dance halls, and love were as vague as dreams.</p>
<p>Last night, I visited my good friend T after marriage. Their small family was next to Lafayette Road, the mysterious street of the concession. At the end of the conversation, they shouted to go to the park. I followed them without expressing an opinion.</p>
<p>Stepping into the gate of the park, I seemed to flip open my diary. The past life awakened from the mist. The stream and the secluded path were all the old places where I wandered alone. Now, they are full of the fragrant traces of ladies. Pairs and pairs, whispering like warblers, add so much enchanting light to the park. My consciousness is finally like the unrecoverable regret of losing my childhood. Walking slowly with broken moon shadows, I felt a hidden pain in my heart, like iron heels pressing on my heart.</p>
<p>We walked bit by bit, each with different emotions. A burst of singing came from the pavilion. Ohl MyDearl My Lovel. I shivered and watched Mr. and Mrs. T climb up the steps, embracing each other. I sat down on the chair by the side of the road. The moonlight shone on me, and the shadow slanted on the side of the road. I smiled and thanked her. The shadow never left me in my life, and at the same time, I thanked the kindness of the moonlight.</p>
<p>"Ping, what's wrong?" T found that I had not gone to the pavilion and returned to ask me.</p>
<p>"I'm tired," I lied, unwilling to spoil the beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>They left me, and I walked out of the park gate in a daze. Looking back at the park, it was dark and gloomy like hell. The dreams that awakened from the mist were once again called back by the demon of bread.</p>
<p>I took a long breath and flew onto the rickshaw and returned home like fleeing.</p>
<p>Sexual Issues</p>
<h3>Remarriage</h3>
<p>— Shizhi</p>
<p>In a certain unprogressive town | my hometown | recently, a widow remarried. Because of the constraints of old etiquette, she was inevitably criticized by the people of the town; especially the elders of the eighteenth century. But I tried my best to explain it for her, and believed that she was brave and had perseverance.</p>
<p>The fact is this: The widow, Ms. S, is a member of the intellectual class. She received higher education and is now a grade teacher in a certain primary school in Shanghai, and her monthly salary is also fifty or sixty yuan. But her family was very poor in the past, so all her expenses during her studies were provided by her deceased husband, Mr. W. The two of them were engaged from childhood, and they studied together before marriage, and their relationship was very harmonious. Later, Ms. S and Mr. W graduated from a certain university at the same time, and the two officially married. Unfortunately, on the seventh day after the marriage. Mr. W, Ms. S's only husband, died of overwork, resulting in an illness. When Mr. W was dying, he含沪 ordered his beloved Ms. S: Do not ask her to keep her vows for him, and sacrifice the happiness of her life, but hope that she will always protect his old mother | her mother-in-law | only.</p>
<p>After Mr. W died, Ms. S, although she thought of her husband's warmth and consideration, was so sad that she wanted to die. But for the sake of the family's economic relations, she taught in a primary school in Shanghai. She lived her lonely and depressed life very peacefully to maintain her mother-in-law's life. Although her mother-in-law died for her lovely son, she got such a virtuous daughter-in-law, and she got a lot of comfort in her heart.</p>
<p>Ms. S spent six years of depressed life like this, and she was confident that she was worthy of her deceased husband's love.</p>
<p>Recently, she thought of the darkness of the future, she felt the hunger of sex; and she was influenced by the trend; she saw Ms. Tao and Principal Jiang struggling and combining, which caused a sensation for a while. Because of the above reasons: she made her resolutely engage in a formal engagement with Mr. K, whom she considered satisfactory, in order to fix her future and solve her sexual problems.</p>
<p>Indeed. Keeping the vows is cruel, especially for Ms. S, who is in her youth, so I sympathize with Ms. S's remarriage this time, and I hope they will have a good marriage soon!</p>
<p>However, after Ms. S remarries, she will inevitably break away from her previous mother-in-law, so who will maintain her mother-in-law's life again? Therefore, I finally hope that Ms. S will continue to maintain the life of her previous mother-in-law under whatever name, so that it can be justified in terms of reason and conscience,</p>
