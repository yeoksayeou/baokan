<p>入夏以來。氣候酷熱。最近更有逐日增高之。勢熱度常在百度以上。爲最近五十年所稀見。在此酷熱之下。一般苦力工人及囚犯。中暑斃命者時有所聞。</p>
<p>即如無錫一廠之中。一日之内。中暑者恒數十。而在此酷暑薰蒸之下。虎疫亦應時而作。日來見之於報紙者。如蘇州。武進。奉賢。宜興。徐州。厦門。漳州汕。頭綏遠。涿洲。北平。保定。南昌。包頭鎭。西安。等地。虎勢都極爲猖獗。死亡率常在百分之四十五至五十之間。哀此　遺。於累歲災荒連年戰亂之下。復遭此疾疫之浩刧。此不僅爲人世間之傷心慘事。抑亦爲駭人聞聽之慘變。</p>
<p>虎疫發生之根因。一爲由於去年大水。溺斃人畜。皆爲微菌之大本營。而連年兵亂及今歲淞滬之變。戰區死亡枕藉。屍體暴露。亦微菌之所自生。經炎日之蒸發。疫勢遂一發而不可收拾。凡此水災與戰禍。實皆。由於人謀之不臧。質言之。即皆由於政治之不上軌道。</p>
<p>彼豪富之家。權貴之門。食則鮮美。衣則綺羅。居則崇樓。空氣流通。未屆暑天。即已挈愛子嬌妻。紛赴廬山北戴河青島莫干山等地避暑。何曾知有所謂酷熱。更何曾知有所謂虎疫能殺人。獨彼成千成萬之勞苦大衆。羣集工廠之工人邪許負重之苦力。薰蒸於炎日下之農民。以及流離四方輾轉道途之老弱。在飢餓鞭筆之下。在疲勞襲擊之下。晝則以血肉與酷暑相搏戰。晚則僵臥於路隅遂乃爲疾疫所集故直接殺人者爲虎疫。而間接殺人者爲（貧窮。）不從此種根因上認取疾疫之由來。而僅歸咎於衛生知識之不普遍及病者之不知善攝其生。鳴呼。在飢餓鞭箠之下。易子而食。賣婦爲餐草根樹皮。皆以果腹民苦如斯。固尚有（衛生）可言耶。</p>
<p>吾人認爲災難愈多。即愈以顯示政治之黑暗。故吾人今日而欲防遏虎疫。</p>
<p>毋寗更進而防遏政治上之虎疫。政治而不清明。則一切殺人之災荒與疾疫。終將。永永無由杜絶也。</p>

<p>熱軍抵抗日軍不逞而退</p>
<p>湯平麟派董旅增駐朝陽</p>
<p>北平通信、日軍侵熱、於十八日在朝陽寺北票間與熱軍衝突後、十九·二十兩日、經北平官方致電熱河詢問結果、證明該兩日已無戰事、因日軍停止軍事行動故我軍亦停止抵抗、惟昨日（二十一）日方宣傳熱河當局代表與日軍代表接洽營救石本恢復北票支線等問題、官方聲稱尙未接得正式報告、已去電詢問眞相、惟一般推測、熱邊形勢、確已緩和、交涉進行、或屬可能、茲紀日軍侵熱情形如次、</p>

<p>日軍開砲　同時日本藉口軍用列車有被義勇軍襲擊之舉、是於十八日下午二時、日本旅團部、乃由錦縣派遣鐵甲車兩列、上載日兵千餘名、並裝置十五生的重砲、駛進朝陽寺車站、强欲開往北票、當時由朝陽寺至北票護路軍、爲熱軍董旅第一營長張守鎭、張營長以日軍鐵甲車强迫欲開往北票、本部軍隊旣未奉到命令、當時即以阻止、日軍鐵甲車首先發砲十餘發示威、意在威嚇我少數軍隊、</p>
<p>我軍抵抗是時我軍張營長正擬與鐵甲車日軍官長交涉、日軍猛以機關槍射擊、我方當起而抵抗、一度發生激戰、地點在朝陽寺附近、至下午八時、熱軍因兵力單薄、將全部集中南嶺、南嶺爲錦朝支路之重要山地、山下有一隧道、火車通過、可達北票、日鐵甲車因我軍猛烈抵抗、於是退往朝陽寺車站開回錦縣、張長左腿確受微傷、以上爲熱邊衝營突實在情况、</p>

<p>因曁大法敎兩院之裁併及北大女文理法院師大暫停招生</p>
<p>頃敎育部部長朱家驊氏對於上海曁南大學法學院敎育學院之裁併及北平大學女子文理學院法學院師範大學之暫停招生有所說明</p>
<p>略稱最近數月來國中敎育界人士感於國難之危迫因念敎育爲立國之本雖與政治經濟種種俱有密切關係互爲因果不可分離然卽就敎育本身而論敎育現狀之不能滿意終爲無可掩飾之事實往往發抒偉論共圖改革熱忱卓見至可感佩綜合各方意見其討論集中之點於高等敎育則多主應求充實勿事舗張必須提高研究學術之程度并注意於實用人材之培植毋事量多祗貴質精於中等敎育則多主切合社會需要救濟國民生計認爲現有普通中學之林立實嫌發展過量應行擴充職業敎育并力求改進使確能增加社會之生產能力於初等及社會敎育則多主因應目前環境須於最短年間使失學兒童可受必要之敎育同時對於成年文盲之充斥須力謀掃除凡此意見幾成舉國一致之呼聲僉以爲今後辦理敎育必須破除造就士大夫之傳統觀念務求切合國家社會之實際與近代之意義卽本部自十九年舉行全國敎育會議議决改進全國敎育方案亦大致標準斯旨規劃成編最近感於近年之事實部中亦正在詳密研討陸續計劃惟茲事體大必須經審愼周密之籌計希望於不久期間得舉以與國人商榷也</p>
<p>茲只就國立及省立之大學與獨立學院而言畢業生成績之不良程度之低劣設備之欠缺研究學術風尙之不競幾爲普遍之現象然最覺引以爲遺憾者卽爲辦學之無方針無計劃設大學·立院系·每忽略客觀之環境及其具備之基礎相互仿傚企慕虚榮從事舗張專務粉飾設課程開講座每忽略基本科目之研究舉各種學科之實在性浮泛龐雜不顧體系職此二因前者之病同一區内同屬政府設立之大學則院系重疊論設備則同一欠缺論敎授敎材亦往往皆斯人也皆斯物也而又一方面卽在一較小城市之大學無需鉅額設備費之文法敎育各院則務求應有盡有卽在一設備費甚鉅之工學院而土木·電氣機械·化學·建築·採礦·冶金各科則必使一無遺漏究竟設備能力爲如何地方需要爲如何皆不論矣後者之病一科可以賅括研究之材料則故爲割裂置基本科目於不顧而競尙新奇普通物理尚未了解而相對論却不可不習經濟思想史不爲系統之論列而享希圖馬克斯等學說必須另開一科基此二因舗張粉飾浮泛龐雜在大學之本體旣如是矣從而學者更可知也夫以中國現時之人力財力而論政府卽集中力量以辦理三五大學尙虞不給無如民十以來只見改大運動之高唱而大學實質之進步則鮮有見及談大學敎育者每咎政治之不良經費之不足畢業生之無出路其言固甚是矣然衡情度理此亦只片面之觀察也所以大學之合理化大學之整理與充實確爲一至迫切至重要之問題惟是事至繁重非經縝密之討論不能得一妥善適當之方案非有從事大學敎育者之澈底認識與共同努力亦末由改進學術爲天下公物大學爲研究學術之機關固非人非歷史非爲學術以外之目的之所可私有而限制之也眞理時代與文化之前途不斷的昭臨吾人之左右目前大學敎育種種不滿意之狀態實并非任何一校所可盡免亦非任何一人所應負責必須共同努力以求繼續不斷之整理與充實而獲得合理之解决也</p>
<p>至於此次政府之决議裁并曁南大學法學院與敎育學院以及北平大學女子文理學院法學院與師範大學之本年暫停招生并非一任何奇特之事實亦只是整理工作之一着而已按曁南大學之設立其目的本爲敎育華僑之子弟華僑於役異邦效勞祖國政府念其賢勞特立斯校有人以爲華僑子弟之歸國只須另設中小學以施特殊之敎育而於大學則毋庸隔離設立正需與國内青年融洽一堂俾於祖國之文化與風尙多所認識且在事實上華僑子弟之歸國其入曁南以外之大學受敎育者實居多數而曁南現在過半數之學生亦并非屬於華僑之子弟此又爲一論現在只就裁併該校法學院與敎育學院而言該校不幸自經暴日摧殘頗有損傷政府對於上海被災學校雖决議交由戰區善後委員會統籌救濟然體察事實該會救濟之力恐一時尙難償其所失故該校必須採取緊缩與集中政策以期無減敎育之效率卽鄭校長對於學系之歸併亦曾有所計議矣上海離京只七小時之路程南京國府所在政治實施悉起於此卽法政學者亦多集於斯地故令其裁撤法學院將現有學生轉入中央大學肄業至於敎育學院之改爲敎育學系正如此次中大敎育學院之改併四系爲一系蓋改院爲系并非含有不尊重敎育學之意思大學生修習敎育以爲師資之備自是甚善在華僑青年固尤爲必要但是特設一院專習敎育科目在一方面苟缺乏文理基本科目之研究試問除敎育科目外將持何術以爲人師在又一方面如許專習敎育之學生畢業後又那得加許敎育行政機會以展其所學要之曁南大學之目的除研究學術而外在實際上本有訓練師資與發展商務人才之特殊目的卽此以論該校之留有文學院理學院商學院以及專爲華僑子弟設立之中小學固是妥善之法再以原有法學院及敎育學院之經費彌補其災害并爲充實文理商各學院及中小學内容之用前途固甚可樂觀也</p>
<p>又按北平大學其有七院學生約二千六百人藝術學院及俄文法政學院在十九年已由部令飭停止招生逐年辦理結束矣女子文理學院有人主張顧念家庭習慣及女生特長應改設女子大學以宏造就亦有謂男女在各大學皆已兼收并容並無特别設立任何大學或學院之必要似此問題猶待研究法學院在北京大學與清華大學雖皆有設立然有人以爲該二校法學院之研究乃偏重理論方面而平大法學院今後須謀注重實際方面以養成法治應用之人材此亦爲尙待研究之問題至於師範大學約有學生一千六百人本爲造就中學師資之目的然按諸現在内容竟與普通大學無異頗患名實不符之病近有人主張師範大學應專收大學畢業生之有志爲中學敎育者修習敎育一年亦有人主張仍存現制將其課程組織切合於充任師資之目的似此問題都未可易以决定大體言之在北平一隅國立大學之院系重疊顯然可見卽北平大學與師範大學設備之不完善政府亦極爲關念尤以師大物理實騐室去年之遭遇火災至可婉惜該二校近年迭起風潮内容複雜每令辦學者深感困難此次政府决議師範大學與北平大學所屬妇女子文理學院之暫停招生原爲便於各該校院之易於整理與改善</p>
<p>夫學校招生本爲一種敎育計劃一方面須體察社會之需要某種人材爲如何另一方面須由學校體察本身在敎育效率之容易於如何現在各校之慣行辦法各院各系漫無决擇豈得爲善該師大及平大法學院女子文理學院之原有學生已屬不少且在社會上此項人材一時亦形供過於求暫停招添新生自是應有之舉要知招生爲辦學之一計劃何校何院應否招添招添幾何皆應有一規定此次政府之决議并非有何軒輊於其間譬如北平工農醫三院之准其招生亦並非卽謂此三院之辦理成績較他院爲優原因此類學院在北平尙屬無多而國家需要建設人才又甚爲急切且顧念各地青年之升學不得不酌予容納之地也</p>
<p>總之政府此次對於中央大學勞動大學青島大學以及曁南平大師大之整理辦法皆經極長時間之討論而審愼决定之舉凡所定裁併整理與暫停招生之辦法表面看來似近消極方面之行動存惡意者或甚至詆爲摧殘現有之敎育其實積極意義至爲　深一切皆爲學生本身之學業以及熱心辦學者之便利術立計至關於各私立大學今後當亦採取嚴格整頓之辦法以期全國青年咸得進修學問之眞正塲合而蔚爲國用政府怵念國難期望大學對於國家之貢獻至爲殷切卽社會人士近月以來之表示亦同抱此見要之整理大學非一時之事正須長期之努力亦非政府一方面所可達到尙望從事大學敎育者之戮力同心以共策進行現在政府於財政拮据之中對於國立各校院經費自本月起勉求十足發給免予減成凡茲苦心衆所共見來年大學之成績爲如何要　於吾人今日之努力本部職司敎育對於今後敎育之如何改進極願接受各方面之意見以期臻於妥善同時對於政府之任何决定亦惟有矢誠矢勇不辭勞怨以力圖實施耳</p>

<p>有一件事很値得注意就是歐亞研究學術好像同時開端，當西洋的希臘哲學發揚開端，拍拉圖，亞里斯多德輩相繼講學的時候，中國適繼三代，春秋，戰國，而到秦漢，諸子的著作也盛極一時，中間雖經秦始皇的焚書坑儒，仍禁不住諸子學說的傳流。當羅馬的謝雪盧大出風頭，漢代的文章也冠絶一時。羅馬統一了歐洲，西漢也幾乎統一了亞洲。宋時有黄白術，西洋在中古時期鍊金術和魔術也盛極一時。在這東西文化相息相通的事實中··吾們就可以明瞭人類的智慧並不因種族的不同而分高下的。</p>
<p>東西文化相通的地方，誠不勝枚舉！譬如秦始皇築長城，建阿房宮，同時羅馬也大興土木。阿房宮的奢麗，阿房宮賦記得歷歷如目，可惜早被項羽一把火燒了，使後人無從瞻仰憑吊。其實，中國文化的價値，往往被一般人所糟塌，歷來文化上的建設。多數是遭燒殺的刧數。文化悠遠的國家，獨多愛燒愛殺的人物，而這般愛燒愛殺的人物，又世世代代綿延不絶，冲積似的，點滴似的文化那裏禁得起世世代代的燒殺啊！</p>
<p>說起阿房宮，在咸豐年間有一位英國駐華公使呌做魏多瑪，竟興致勃發，大做其攷據。魏多瑪的華文很好，居然著過一本華語讀本給英國人讀。依魏多瑪的攷據，在阿房宮的園裏，有水銀做的船，金銀做的鴨鵝，橋樑是銅絲網做的，上去跑路很軟熟。然而阿房宮旣被無情的項羽一把火燒了魏多瑪固然說得天花亂墜，那裏有眞實憑據做證明。</p>

<p>— 壬午</p>
<p>二十世紀的戰爭，純粹是科學的，亦即是化學的，即如飛機在二十年以前，只有一種理想，東方雜誌的新飛艇，誇大其說。不料這次閘北之戰，日本竟憑藉了飛機，抛擲炸彈，毁壞的閘北成了焦土。中國不是亦有飛機嗎？在鄭州一役，頗著成效。日本知道中國飛機將至上海，遠迎於蘇州。這一次空中戰爭，美國蕭德殉焉，日本戰士亦死傷。再於錢塘江上，作拂曉之戰。於是飛機的戰爭，必成爲太平洋覇權者先鋒高射砲是飛機的對頭。但是蔡霖生所發明的飛雷，有人說··（已經成功的，并有很好的成績。）有人說··一只是一種宣傳，飛雷只是飛天神雷，射程不遠，打不下飛機來的。如果眞有飛雷，何以不見記載。一二說均有理由，只望蔡霖生更從事研究必有成功之一日。</p>
<p>毒瓦斯的種類，各國所造，計有二百餘種。捷克所造，尤爲神妙。此次上海閘北的戰爭，日本雖宣傳未曾採用，但捷克所造，爲日本所收買，確有其事。將來毒瓦斯的使用，是必然的。中國軍隊莫患日本之使用毒瓦斯，患在我不能發明抵禦毒瓦斯之利器達姆彈已證明於醫院矣。烟霧彈已見於藴藻浜衣瀏河矣！輕重坦克車更飛馳於吳淞江灣之間。只有（死光）的發明，傳說紛紛，尙未見諸戰事。至於日本新發明的魚雷，將來在太平洋上，必有其稱雄之日。中國</p>

<p>中日上海戰事中。記者嘗往返戰地。有時前線寗靜。恒記友於壕中。促膝坐於地下。暢談戰事零訊。或有告我以奪槍之事。其事至趣。緣在八字橋劇戰時。我軍反攻。先遣敢死隊十四人。手懷炸彈。衝入敵陣。時敵有二十人守一機槍。見我軍逼近。不及發槍而倉皇退却。我軍不費一彈。乃奪得機槍。復反槍以掃射。前此守此槍之敵。竟無一倖免。以其人之道。還治其人之身。其斯之謂乎。今熱乎河急矣。爰書此以勵衛國之健兒。</p>
<p>只有迎送官差的輸，所以魚雷，潛行艇，都有英雄無用武之地的歎息。</p>
<p>中國人近來所講求者，只有幾本破書，尙是在外國買回來的。要說到科學的理化書，各大學的理科，旣然走錯了路。政府諸公所注重又不在此。我所望於各大報者，多載關於科學文字，或者不無小補耶？</p>

<p>我說（你們高中三年的工作。現在告）段落了。可喜可賀呀。）</p>
<p>他聽了把眉頭一皺。嘆一口氣道。（唉。什麽可喜可賀。現在是在過難關呢。我眞灰心極了。）</p>
<p>我說（什麽事使得你這般不開心呢。）他搖搖頭他說（當我未畢業的時候。我時時用心考慮的便是考那一個大學。我想到北平去吧。那裏好學校倒有。但是離家太遠了。往返一次。路費實在不少。我想在上海讀書吧。但是生活程度太貴。並且好學校也有限。想來想去我想只是考中大好。因爲裏面設備聽說很好。而且收費不多。離家也近。所以我終日念念不忘的。便是如何去投考中大。唉。老兄。事情眞令我太灰心了。剛接到招生簡章。第二天看報。說中大解散了。我心裏急得什麽似的。前後去問敎員。敎員說。這不過是一時現象。不久定要恢復的。囑我照常預備。唉。那知恢復莫說未定期。率性今年也不招生了。你想。我怎麽好呀。）</p>
<p>我說。今年眞不招考。你就找一件事做做。到朋年再考不也是一樣嗎。</p>
<p>他說。唉。老兄。你看錯了。你想我們這一個平平凡凡的中學生。在何處去找事呀。現在失業的人。一天天加多。像我這樣程度的，眞是車載斗量。各處各納不下向何去找事呢。說是進家庭大學吧。非特自已閒著慚愧。而且青春不再。以後那裏有機會去讀書呢。我們眞是呌上不得下不得。唖　吃黄連。有苦說不出。只自已心裏知道罷了。咳。不但我呢。有好多好多的中學生。同我抱着一般計畫的。他們也和我一般痛苦呢。）</p>
<p>他很爲憤懣。他繼續說。（有時我不得不恨政府不負責任平時一班官僚政客。都好來辦敎育。也不去查問他。一旦閙事來。便是（解散）。（停辦）。（封閉）。撤消）。絲毫不曾顧到學生的光陰與學業。你想整頓就整頓。短時間内很可恢復。誰知竟弄成這樣。政府那裏爲學生着想呢。那裏把敎育當個敎育呢。實在要是把敎育當做敎育。也不會糟到這步田地了。）</p>

<p>（十五）自來水筆工廠</p>
<p>自來水筆。向係來自外洋。而日貨尤多。以其價廉。頗能暢銷一時近四五年中。上海有關勒銘自來水筆廠。大中華自來水筆廠。一在康脫路。一在西愛咸斯路愼成里。均係國人開設者。</p>
<p>製造自來水筆時。先製筆桿。桿多賽珍品類。以橡膠和松香製之。取筆桿度其長短。車就内外螺絲。再配裝上下銅件。裝吸水带。筆頭等。卽成。銅件大部非自製。買自銅件作者。如此分工製造。成本較可低廉。至筆頭。則完全外貨。</p>
<p>工作機器。係小號台車床。銀孔機。虎鉗。抛車數種。台車床需用較多。故多用馬達扡带。便一手持各式車刀旋用。重要工作。亦卽在此。蓋小小一筆桿。設螺絲不密切。勢必墨水淋漓。爲人厭棄。每車床每日止可出筆二三枝。蓋精細工作。非可迅速從事也。市價貴者。每枝價洋八元。賤者四元左右。關勒銘月可出筆百打。大中華亦相仿佛。</p>
<p>實則製造自來水筆。工作手續雖複雜。然在家庭中。辦一台車床。及手搖小鑽床小台鉗等。卽可從事工作。月設出筆二三十枝。其利或得一家生活矣。</p>
<p>（十六）墨水廠</p>
<p>上海製造墨水者。有關勒銘民生大華中一金城中華商務等六七家。</p>
<p>近年自來水筆風行敎育界中人幾人各一枝而自來水筆所需用之墨水。亦隨之銷行大廣。查墨水之佳者。須中無渣滓。顏色鮮明。書寫流利。中分紅藍二二色而藍色筆用尤廣。上品等市價每打洋二元左右。外貨價値較昂。其行銷我國者。亦以彼之僑民及洋商爲多。蓋國人多用國貨矣。况敎育界中人耶。</p>
<p>墨水原料。以五倍子顏色等。和水調之。經一二度提煉沉清渣滓卽成。有加香料者。取其氣味清香。冀博買客之歡迎耳。雖小小一物。年銷亦有數萬元之多。好在製造者無須多大工具。無須勞工。籌洋三五十元。卽可在家庭中製造之。裝璜亦極簡單。</p>
<p>製造墨水者。大都兼造毛筆用之墨汁原料爲墨粉。製者初皆用我國舊時之松烟墨粉。後以外貨之製造油墨用之墨粉。較爲合用。多改用之。以其無渣滓。而濃淡均匀。惜成本較貴耳。其餘一切製造手續。與墨水同。</p>

<p>六十一</p>
<p>朱先生的議論好一比是金鷄納丸，初嘗是甜蜜蜜的，只要你失誤咬了下去，便立刻嘗到苦味。他老是在糖菓夾下一兩塊黄連使你呑不下去。比如他聽所說的六大訓練，頭五種是毫無疑問，爲什麽又要加上這生育的訓練？（生得好）當然是人人贊成的。誰願意生壞孩子呢？（生龍生蛇，全憑天老爺）雖然是句迷信話，但是把這天老爺當做天然老爺看·也就言之成理。誰能說，他一定會生好孩子，不會生壞孩子？照平常的眼光看來，帝堯生的孩子總該是好的吧，何以偏偏生出一個不肖的丹朱？從另一方面看，　叟生了一個傲慢的象是不足爲奇，但他何以偏偏又生出一個大孝大智的舜？朱先生能敎堯不生丹朱嗎？他能敎瞽叟不生象而單生舜這樣的人嗎？至於（至得少）三個字我就格外不能了解了。現在中國受了帝國主義的壓迫，正要獎勵生聚運用偉大人口的力量去抵抗，何能敎人少生小孩子以自减國力？况且朱先生時常說他收學生如韓信點兵，多多益善，於今他却要提倡减少人口，眞是出我意料之外。老實說，這塊黄連我呑不下去。我不敢盲從却又不願信口批評。同時，我承認朱先生總不是隨嘴亂說。他必定是有一些事實做他的主張的根據。我要先審查他所根據的事實再去批評他的主張，最後才能决定我對於這種主張是否贊同。我主意打好了之後，就向朱先生說··（我對於先生的减少人口的主張很懷疑，現在想請你給我一些事實上的證據看看。）朱先生說··你這個態度是學者做學問的一個根本態度··（拿證據來！）學理必須建立在證據上纔能顚撲不滅。不過我對於你還有進一步的希望。你旣懷疑我的主張，難免不懷疑我搜集的事實。我希望你兩步當做一步走，自已在人口問題上去搜集事實，讓這些事實自然而然的喚出主張來。你心裏不要有一絲一毫的成見。等到你從事實裏濾出主張，再拿來和我的事實與主張比一比看是誰的對。那時如果是我的對，你便放棄你的主張·，如果是你的對，我一定把我的主張棄掉依從你。你得便進城可以到大學圖書館，市立圖書館，以及别的圖書館裏把人口問題的著作都流覽一下然後跑到社會裏上事實的源頭上去親自詳細訪問。這個工作是很有趣味。你可以從容的幹。好在我的一個銅板的節育法還没有發明，等你研究好了再决定我們的方針也不遲，）好，就這麽幹吧。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>有好社會然後有好政府，有好國民然後有好領袖，我考察我國的社會和國民性，處處令人悲觀，眞用得着無藥救三字，可以包括，此種事件甚多，我試舉下面三個例子，</p>
<p>青年專好自殺，戀愛不成自殺，讀書不成自殺，經濟壓迫自殺，這種自殺的行爲，完全表現無奮鬥精神，强毅氣槪，一經挫折，即思一死了之，此種觀念，全是表現國民性之脆弱，而無任重致遠之能力，此所謂無藥救者一，</p>
<p>報紙所載，我國人被綁或被刦，外人一聞此事，莫不奮不顧身，拔刀相助，而我國人即職司持治安之警察或幾位巡捕先生，一聞有警，多畏縮不前，所謂犯不着因幾十元薪工，去犧牲生命，即一家之中，亦恐是這樣，父兄看見子弟被綁，還自喜我得幸免，子弟看見父兄被盜刦持，還自喜我逃走得快，至於鄰舍被綁被盜，更要關緊大門，不敢出去，這種自私自利的心理，實是亡國亡家之根本，只是我國人所獨有，不顧公德，不懂義氣，此種人羣，自然渙散，此所謂無藥救者二，</p>
<p>九一八事變，一二八事變，我國所受之恥辱，所嘗之苦痛，何等嚴重，曾幾何時，而五分鐘之熱度已過，即嫌怨胥捐，渾忘前事，據海關貿易册報告，上月南方日貨輸入，僅較去年减少百分之十五，北方輸入，竟超過百分之二十五，即此一端，足見人心已死，尙復何言，甚且溥儀在事變時，竟利用此機會，大做其傀儡，江北人且利用此機會，大做其漢奸，我國人全無心肝，全無國家觀念，至於此極，此所謂無藥救者三，</p>
<p>以上這種情形，假使你留心點，在我國社會中，處處有得表見，處處可以看出，此種事體似小，而國家之無希望，無辦法，無生路，即在於此，</p>

<p>前天張　粟君建議改良男子服式，的確現在的服式，有改良的必要，非但男子拖泥带水的長衫要改良，就是現在女子短在大腿上的褲子，也有改有的必要，否則這二條公開出來大腿的引誘，不知要誤　多少青年呢。</p>
<p>衣服是保護身體的，男子夏天的絨襪，女子冬天的絲襪短褲，這些太覺不合衛生了，講到西裝，雖美觀便利，然而穿着太麻煩，又太貴族化了，妨且現在夏天，着獨短褲，又未免太氣悶吧，因此本會員主張男子的服裝，上身照學生義式樣，旣便利，又雅觀，又合張君建議長不過膝短必過腰的原則，還可以表示學者的態度，至於下身，我以爲短褲最輕便適合，不過褲長要長及於膝，否則有失雅觀。</p>
<p>有一位鄉老見了現在的摩登少爺，摩登女郎，大發疑問，說現在眞可算文明了，女人的褲子，由很長行到現在，好像没有着，男子呢？反而由短褲（農夫穿短褲的多）長到促着地，唉奇怪，文明呢？妖精化？所以本會員討論男子的服式之外，還要附带建議改良女子的短褲。</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>（一）褲子短絲襪薄在冷天不能保護身體</p>
<p>（二）有碍風化引誘青年誤入歧途因此本會員主張女子褲長必定要長過於膝是否適當請</p>
<p>貴會提出交各會員共同討論此致改良社會討論會公鑒會員懷靜誠</p>

<p>— 張鼎銘</p>
<p>在這新舊思想交替的時代中，我們這中國社會的一切舊制度未經澈底地破壞重佈革命的新建築以前，社會上的一切現象，都呈着畸形，尤其是澎湃着的人生史上最切要的婚姻問題，這問題和社會確有重大的關係，同時也會影響到國家和民族的前途，因爲家庭是社會的基礎，家庭又是以婚姻爲先提，所以我們要研究民族問題，社會的改良，除了敎育和政治的新建設以外，我敢說··這也是一個重要的問題，看看近今不是閙着熱烈的爲婚姻而自殺嗎？要是任其消長下去，不加設法，社會上不是有極大的危害嗎！我可先拿舊婚姻制度的毒弊大槪地來說一下</p>
<p>一　舊婚姻的結合完全是受着舊禮敎的指使丨父母之命媒妁之言丨雙方旣不能會晤，又無從互相地考察各個的品性和家庭狀况及一切，全以虚僞的物質爲目標，這樣的盲目婚姻，在愛情原則上根本不能成立，要知婚姻是要以愛情愛基礎的，否則徒成怨偶，精神上終身感到萬分苦痛和悲哀？</p>
<p>二　舊婚姻結合的手續旣屬麻煩而一切儀式在這革命潮流之下，旣封建且又糜費太甚，像禮金丨可說賣身金，還有衣飾的爭短論長，面子上的舗張聲勢，在資產階級者的結婚費常常會消耗到數千或萬餘元，小資產階級者竟有因之破產或負重債，而無產階級者簡絶是談不到，祗可無形中抱着獨身主義，不少有眞切愛情的青年們，因着這種惡習俗的包圍，不能達到圓滿結局，甚或演生慘劇，所以這種吃人的舊習俗，須切實的去破除，同時由政府嚴令禁止，如有陽逢陰違，不遵禁令者，須予以相當懲罰·</p>
<p>三　舊婚姻之結婚期限其年齡絶無標準，有未成年發育未成熟的男女，因着父母的威脅，早年成婚，致損害其體力及壽限，於國家及社會間的事業方面，間接的也受到損害，這也應由政府嚴令禁止，</p>
<p>我們除了努力地去打倒以上所述的神聖愛情的魔障以外，更須這樣做去··一　愛情的終點是結婚，結婚是我們生命史上一個迫切的追求，在事先若無深切的認識，愼重的考慮，必致成終身之恨，不可消磨的創痛丨而至意志頽唐，甚或無意人世，所以我們在相識以後，一定要有以下幾個條件的瞭解才可進訂婚約··Ａ雙方品性的瞭解Ｂ學力程度的考察，Ｃ愛力眞假的試騐，Ｄ家庭狀况的偵查·總之··時代下的婚姻標準，不宜夾雜以物質或因性的追求和其他有作用的爲條件，這樣以後一定會得到痛苦的結果，在這畸形式的社會中，虚僞的人類間，我們對這個問題，寗可審愼於初，不要貽恨於後喲</p>
<p>二　在以上第一條雙方都已認爲滿意，同時已有相當時期的戀愛時，可挽出介紹人向雙方家長徵得同意，進訂婚約，其辦法宜採取最簡單絶對廢除賣買式，其辦法如下··雙方互相交換信物，合攝訂婚紀念照，或登報宣布三　訂婚後在自身生產能力上有家庭負担之可能性時，即可結婚，其儀式以最新式儀式爲標準，事實上絶對不可過事舗張，虚耗金錢，如假旅館中或任何機關團體中之禮堂行禮節，參加婚禮之戚友則備以茶點或清簡之酒肴供待，以示暢樂，至最簡單者，則此種形式上的禮節亦可不需要，祇須經雙方同意後，即可登報宣佈實行同居，蓋愛情重在精神，不必拘泥於形式上喲</p>

<h3 id="c194">白色顏料的製法 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>白色顏料，種類極多，其中最重要的，就是下列四種，今將其製法，分述如下</p>
<p>（一）鹽基性炭酸鹽白鉛粉（ＢａｓｉｃＣａｒｂｏｎａｔｅＷｈｉｔｅＬｅａｄ（ＰｂＣＯ３）２Ｐｂ（ＯＨ）２）這種顏料是由二氧化炭和氧化鉛相作用而成，其方法有二·，</p>
<p>（一）法蘭西法把氧化鉛儘量的溶解於醋酸鉛的水溶液中，以作鹽基性醋酸鉛鹽，於是送入二氧化炭，則有白鉛粉沉澱而出，瀘過之，瀘液中還含有醋酸鉛，故再可溶解氧化鉛，製成白鉛粉，這是新式的製法，</p>
<p>（二）荷蘭法盛有醋酸（其强度約與酸醋等）的士瓶，上置鉛板，四周圍以動植物質之廢棄物，因其醱酵而放出熱及二氧化炭，醋酸因熱而成蒸氣，與鉛相作用而生鹽基性醋酸鉛鹽，又受二氧化炭之作用，變成鹽基性炭酸鉛鹽，即鹽基性炭酸鹽白鉛粉，那些作用極慢，約須時間一○○至一三○天，這是舊式的製法，</p>
<p>鹽基性炭酸鹽白鉛粉的成分的百分率，約炭酸鉛七五，氫氧化鉛二五··或氫化鉛八五，二氧化炭及水一五，牠和硫化氫氣相接觸，變成黑色，因爲發生黑色硫化鉛的緣故，</p>
<p>（二）白（ＺｉｎｃＷｈｉｔｅＺｎＯ）其製法有二·，</p>
<p>（一）亞美利加法以無烟炭使鋅礦還原成金屬鋅，其蒸氣自爐頂流出，與空氣混合，燃燒成　白，</p>
<p>（二）法蘭西法把金屬鋅在流動空氣中蒸煉，發生蒸氣，燃燒而成氧化鋅（即純白）的白色烟體，</p>
<p>鋅白光亮而純白，大都用於瓷油，牠和硫化氣作用，仍不變色，因爲硫化鋅也是白色以的緣故，</p>
<p>（三）鹽基性硫酸鹽白鉛粉（ＢａｓｉｃＳｕｌｆａｔｅＷｈｉｔｅＬｅｎｄ（ｐｂＳＯ４）２Ｐｂ（ＯＨ）２把方鉛礦（ＰｂＳ）烘炙，其揮發出來的烟，在空氣中氧化而成鹽基性硫酸鹽白鉛粉，這是很好的白色顏料，其成分的百分率是硫酸鉛七五，氧化鉛二○，及氧化鋅五，　的化學性質，極爲穏定，和硫化物作用，不會變黑，用於塗飾木器，較鹽基性炭酸鹽白鉛粉更佳，</p>
<p>（四）Ｌｉｔｈｏｐｃｎｅ（ＢｓＳＯ４ＺｎＳ）這種顏料的製法，是把硫酸鋅及硫化鋇的溶液相混合，即有不溶解性的硫酸鋇及硫化鋅，同時沉澱出來，其反應是··</p>
<p>ＺｎＳＯ４＋ＢａＳＺｎＳ＋ＢａＳＯ４</p>
<p>這沉澱物含有硫酸鋇百分之七○至七五，其餘都是硫化鮮，這種混合的沉澱物，不宜用爲顏料，必須將其燒至暗紅色，驟然投入水中，成爲軟塊·於是研成粉末，用水洗淨，使其乾燥·即成很好的白色顏料，</p>

<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>當然，聽書去没有打考爾夫時髦，但在某一點立塲上，書塲裏依舊不乏聽衆，在上海無論那裏可以發見一方長形的木板，掛在煎饅頭攤的上面，寫着，本樓特請光裕社名家ⅩⅩⅩ彈唱ⅩⅩ）等字樣，你們丨大脚褲的大學生，硬領頭的少爺們，切不可毫不思索地踏上，這搖動的樓梯，因爲當你看到這不滿數方丈的陋室内，無秩序地横着幾條板凳，滿地的瓜子殻，和那裏特有的氣味，你們會搖搖頭把未踏上樓面的最後一步，很迅速地向後轉，</p>
<p>現在所說的（聽書去）顯然並不指聽嚮擋的Ⅹ調，像幾位彎着腰，拱着水烟袋的自以爲老前輩，風雨無阻釘在固定的座頭（行話）上，像抽雅片一樣，不可一日無此君，你們先得把自已裝得花團錦簇·西裝褲須燙得像幾何學裏的垂直線，二寸高的硬領頭支持你整個的頭顱，晚飯以後，在丁路上閒蕩·兩道銳利的目光，追尋你們的出發點，就往高入雲霄的從房裏送進自已的身體，躺在舒適的安樂椅裏，喝着可口的香茗，不問台上誰唱的什麽書，你的耳朶儘可偷聽隔座的私語，有挿話的機會，如金蒼蠅叮臭鴨蛋的加進去，如其你是一位政客式的交際家，那是不難獲得對方的反應，因爲他們的口號，（在這裏的都是我們同志，）是同志當然有發言權，你的眼睛，更其自由了，儘你左顧右盼，與你的鼻官並施妙用，在習習的電風扇下，你再也想不到那些因爲屋裏熱度高得睡不穏的不著衣服的無產階級，躺在柏油路旁而遭市虎的恩窺，如果眞的這一切的一切都不合你的脾胃，你可以閉上眼皮，到直的夢境裏去追求你所要的一切吧，兩毛錢的代價，不會算你生平的大損失的，</p>

<p>— 王英</p>
<p>黄公館裏的大姐阿Ｋ，是多麽的可愛，從容貎上每一部，都顯出她健美的表示，丨烏黑的頭髮，蛋圓的面龐，飽滿的乳房，矯健的脚步，丨她眞不像是做大姐的人，</p>
<p>黄公館裏的少爺梅生，他是個自命爲風流才子的青年，他眼看阿Ｋ長得這般美麗，頓時起了不良的念頭，不惜以小主人的地位，去各她厮混，阿Ｋ呢？畢竟不懂世情，她目光中以爲得到了小主人的垂青，是無上地光榮，經不起梅生的甜言蜜語，和各種誘惑手段她終於陶醉而失去了她的貞操，</p>
<p>不料他們的秘密，竟給梅生的母親查悉，她老人家認爲主僕發生關係，是一種很大的恥辱，她免不得先給梅生一番敎訓，然後把阿Ｋ停歇了，同時駡着她（爛汚貨，不要臉的東西），可憐的阿Ｋ，雖是懷着無限的怨憤，可是她一點也不敢反抗，更没有勇氣，在黄太太面前說出梅生已經破壞了她的貞操，祇見她低着頭，流着涙，慢慢的走出了黄家的門口，</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been extremely hot. Recently, there has been a trend of increasing heat daily, with temperatures often exceeding 100 degrees, a rare occurrence in the past fifty years. Under this intense heat, it is common to hear of coolies and prisoners dying from heatstroke.</p>
<p>For example, in one factory in Wuxi, dozens of people suffer from heatstroke in a single day. Under the scorching heat, cholera also breaks out in season. Recent newspaper reports mention Suzhou, Wujin, Fengxian, Yixing, Xuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Shantou, Suiyuan, Zhuozhou, Beiping, Baoding, Nanchang, Baotouzhen, Xi'an, and other places, where cholera is rampant. The mortality rate often ranges from 45% to 50%. It is truly lamentable that the surviving people, already suffering from years of continuous disasters, famines, and wars, are now afflicted by this epidemic. This is not only a heartbreaking tragedy for humanity but also a shocking and appalling catastrophe.</p>
<p>The root cause of cholera outbreaks is primarily due to last year's floods, where drowned humans and animals became breeding grounds for bacteria. Furthermore, continuous warfare and this year's Shanghai Incident have left battlefields littered with corpses, also contributing to the proliferation of bacteria. As the hot sun evaporates these sources, the epidemic spreads uncontrollably. These floods and wars are all due to poor human planning, or in other words, the failure of politics to be on the right track.</p>
<p>The wealthy and powerful live lives of luxury, enjoying delicious food, fine clothing, and spacious homes with good ventilation. Before the heat even arrives, they take their beloved children and wives to places like Lushan, Beidaihe, Qingdao, and Moganshan to escape the heat. They have no idea what extreme heat is like, let alone that cholera can kill. However, the vast masses of laborers, factory workers, heavily burdened coolies, farmers toiling under the scorching sun, and the elderly and weak wandering and struggling on the roads, under the whip of hunger and fatigue, battle the heat with their flesh and blood during the day and collapse by the roadside in the evening, becoming vulnerable to epidemics. Therefore, cholera is the direct killer, while poverty is the indirect killer. It is insufficient to attribute the cause of epidemics solely to a lack of public health knowledge or a failure of the sick to take care of themselves. Alas, under the whip of hunger, people exchange children for food, sell their wives for meals, and eat grass roots and tree bark to fill their stomachs. People suffer to such an extent that there is no "hygiene" to speak of.</p>
<p>We believe that the more disasters there are, the more they reveal the darkness of politics. Therefore, if we want to prevent cholera today,</p>
<p>we must go further and prevent the political cholera. If politics is not clean and transparent, all these deadly disasters, famines, and epidemics will never be eradicated.</p>

<p>Also Reconnoiter Pingquan and Lingyuan</p>
<p>Although the Situation in Rehe Appears Calm, Japan's Ambitions May Not Be Subdued</p>
<p>The Japanese Army in Jinzhou is Busy with Deployments, Suggesting Further Offensive Plans</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign News: Several Japanese planes flew over Pingquan and Lingyuan on the 23rd for reconnaissance, scattering various leaflets filled with absurd content. Similar leaflets were also found scattered by Japanese planes in Chengde. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Rehe issue appears to be calming down on the surface as the Japanese army has not launched any further offensives. According to a government official, the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe has been carefully planned for a long time. Although no conflicts have occurred recently, the Japanese army has not abandoned its ambition to invade Rehe. When the Japanese army invaded on the 17th, they only deployed 300 infantry, assuming that the Rehe army would retreat without a fight, replicating the Mukden Incident and seizing Rehe in one fell swoop. However, they did not know that we were determined to defend our territory and fight with all our might. Therefore, after encountering resistance, they quickly retreated. Currently, there are 6,000 to 8,000 Japanese troops stationed in Jinzhou, and they have been busy with deployments recently, suggesting that they may launch another offensive after completing their preparations. This is similar to the situation after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, where the Japanese side requested a three-day ceasefire and then attacked us after deploying reinforcements. The entire nation should pay close attention at this time, actively prepare, and the central government has long been determined to make a final stand. Zhang Xueliang is also determined to fight to the death. In the current situation, there is no way out except to resist to the death. The honor of the 19th Route Army can serve as the best lesson.

<p>(Nanjing) Japan has been spreading rumors about launching simultaneous attacks on Tianjin, Beiping, and the Yangtze River basin. According to official observations, this is purely a Japanese intimidation tactic, aiming to prevent us from providing assistance when they attack Rehe, so as to achieve the effect of defeating us one by one. However, the central government has determined that the survival of Rehe is the survival of the entire nation, and will never allow Rehe to fall into the hands of the enemy. Even if Japan dares to expand the Far East conflict and attack our entire country, we will use the power of the entire nation to fight them to the death. To fight for the survival of the nation, we will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that the Nanjing government is determined to implement double taxation on the Manchurian customs issue. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has decided to extract the following points from it and lodge a strong protest with the Nanjing government: 1. According to Article 25 of the Tianjin Treaty of 1858, regarding imports and exports from Chinese territory, it is stipulated that import goods are taxed at the landing site and export goods are taxed at the embarkation site. Therefore, the theory of double taxation violates the principle of local taxation and violates the treaty. 2. Regarding the Manchurian customs issue, the Japanese government is working hard to mediate in good faith to find a compromise point. China's sudden retaliatory double taxation will lead to endless cycles of retaliation and render Japan's good intentions futile. (24th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) The full text of Chiang Kai-shek's speech to the county magistrates on the 12th was organized and published on the 23rd. The main points are: The party's program and the facilities during the period of political tutelage all give the county an important position. If there are bandits in the county, the county magistrate should take responsibility and should be ashamed of it. Neglecting the red bandits is the biggest shortcoming of the Hubei county government. They only know how to rely on the army and do not know how to organize the local area, so it is not enough to talk about suppressing the bandits. During the Taiping Rebellion, Hu Linyi's method of governing Hubei is worth learning from. Today's bandits are far more ignorant than the Taiping rebels, and the problem lies in the fear of bandits. If this fear cannot be eradicated, the bandits cannot be suppressed. The suppression of bandits must rely on local personnel, and the investigation of household registration and the handling of the Baojia system should be carried out realistically. The prevalence of bandits in Hubei is due to the deception of all levels of government. In the future, we must be realistic, strict in discipline, visit the loyal and trustworthy, and not make false reports. This is the fundamental principle of suppressing bandits. It is necessary to know that where there are people, there is land; where there is land, there is wealth; and where there is wealth, there is a way to use it. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Business circles report that since the Shanghai agreement was signed, Japanese merchants on the Yangtze River have imported 60 million yuan worth of Japanese goods in June, undertaken by Mitsubishi and Mitsui and loaned to wholesale foreign firms or directly operated stores in various places as a basic unit for promotion. Although a small number of Chinese merchants collude with Japanese merchants to repackage Japanese goods and pass them off as Western goods for wholesale, the number is not large. In Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Huangshigang, Hankou, Yichang, Shashi, Chongqing, Changsha, and other metropolitan commercial ports in South China, Japanese-run stores are fully stocked with goods and preparing to resume business simultaneously on August 1st. The Japanese government has also spent a large amount of subsidies to directly subsidize each store, on the one hand, to compensate for the loss of unsaleable goods, and on the other hand, to reduce the cost of goods in order to compete with British and American goods. A dumping policy is adopted to reduce the cost of goods to a minimum. For example, if the same goods cost one yuan for European and American goods, and eight or six jiao for domestic goods, they are sold for five jiao. In addition, all of the Japanese Qing Company's liners are also scheduled to resume service on August 1st. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Main Committee to Convene in September to Decide on Next Session</p>
<p>Many Disappointed with Benes Resolution</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 23rd: After the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference passed the so-called Benes Resolution today, Chairman Henderson declared that the next meeting of the Disarmament Conference's Main Committee is scheduled for September 21st. The plenary session must be convened no more than four months from September 20th, approximately around January 15, 1933. When the resolution was put to a vote, the Chinese representative explained why China could not vote and cited recent events in the Far East. After speeches by various representatives, Henderson spoke, saying that any country opposing the voting resolution opposes the principles listed in the preamble of the resolution, clearly referring to Germany. Thereupon, the German representative Nadolny rose to say that he did not oppose any of the principles in the resolution, and that Germany was among the current supporters of these principles. He had stated yesterday Germany’s reasons for opposing the resolution, so he had to vote against it. Nadolny's words were warmly welcomed by many representatives. After Simon, Gilbert, Benes, Drummond, and Herriot spoke, the conference was indefinitely postponed, ending one of the most memorable and disappointing chapters in recent history.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 23rd: The Disarmament Conference has been indefinitely postponed. Its Main Committee will meet on September 21st to decide when to reconvene. Before the closing meeting today, Russian representative Litvinov delivered a moving speech demanding equal armament. Chinese representative Dr. Yan Huiqing declared that he supported the resolution, but China could not undertake disarmament until the Sino-Japanese dispute was resolved. Last night, British representative Simon made a final appeal, saying that if the resolution were the final decision of the conference, many would hesitate to support it, which he could understand. However, the purpose of the current resolution is to record the progress of the conference, secondly to acknowledge President Hoover’s inspiring call, and thirdly to prepare for the second step of the conference, which does not contain any constraints that violate the important beliefs of any country. Simon also said that he understood the feelings of countries with special systems who raised the issue of equal rights at the end of the Great War, but the time was not yet ripe to discuss this issue. French representative Herriot then stated that France's various demands, such as security and public budget limits, have not been accepted by the conference, so they cannot be completely satisfied with the resolution, but France is still willing to vote in favor of the resolution.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 23rd: An editorial in today's London Times laments that the Benes Resolution passed by the Disarmament Conference did not attempt to eliminate inequality. The newspaper said that this inequality is an important cause of political unrest. The newspaper expressed deep disappointment with the resolution, and further stated that the result of five years of work by the Disarmament Preparatory Committee and five months of discussion by the Disarmament Conference was merely the drafting of a new procedure.</p>

<p>To Consider the War Debt Problem</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd: Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed his views in a radio broadcast today, advocating for the immediate convening of a world conference to consider the revision or cancellation of war debts. Borah suggested that this conference should handle reparations debts, disarmament, the restoration of the gold standard, and the stabilization of silver prices in the East. He also said that the Treaty of Versailles must conform to the dictates of conscience and the demands of fairness. Borah has been one of the most ardent opponents of reducing war debts, and this sudden change of position is noteworthy. This seems likely to discourage those who oppose modifying the war debt agreement and further demonstrates that Americans are gradually believing that war debts are a major obstacle to American trade.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 23rd: House Democratic Leader Rayner wrote an article for the Associated Press today, urging the United States to establish relations with Soviet Russia, saying that the United States must have at least one friend. The situation at the Lausanne Conference and the British Imperial Conference, and the trend of events in Asia, indicate that most countries in the world are uniting to resist the United States for various reasons. Therefore, he urges the United States to find other markets, especially focusing on Soviet Russia. He visited Soviet Russia last summer and saw that although it was treated with American unfriendliness, it still eagerly hoped to trade with the United States. It needs everything that the United States produces. There is more construction in Soviet Russia than anywhere else, and there is no unemployment in the country. Finally, he stated that he advocates for the United States to formally recognize the Soviet Russian government.</p>

In addition to the major parties, there are also many small parties that have formed temporary alliances, such as those advocating that the maximum salary for government officials should not exceed 5,000 marks, forming their own faction. Those promoting the abolition of political parties to ensure fair elections have also formed their own faction. However, the combination of these small factions only serves to disperse the vote and is of little practical benefit.

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd: Recently, Nanjing newspapers reported that Japan, due to its military invasion of eastern China, purchased a large amount of military supplies from Germany, and that German arsenals began working day and night to fulfill these orders and supplement their original workers. Those concerned here regard this report as completely unfounded. Since the end of the European War and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany has been prohibited from manufacturing munitions and transporting them to foreign countries. This is the most obvious fact. Currently, the authorities in various parts of Germany are consistently implementing this prohibition, so there is absolutely no matter of selling military supplies to Japan. However, foreign ships sometimes transport military supplies produced by other countries through German ports, leading to suspicions that they came from Germany. In fact, these ships were already carrying munitions when they passed through Germany, and Germany has no way to prohibit them.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Public Telegram <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Telegram from Jingdezhen: To all newspapers, please note: We recently sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, which reads: "Investigation reveals that the special production and sales tax on porcelain, etc., levied by the Jiangxi Provincial Government is a disguised form of likin, violating the National Government's clear order to abolish likin and contradicting the established policy of abolishing likin and increasing taxes. The people of Jiangxi, already impoverished, find it extremely difficult to bear this harsh tax. The people of Jiangxi, through various organizations and affiliated associations, have repeatedly telegraphed your departments, requesting the prohibition of this tax. Currently, Director of the Collection Bureau, Xiu Siyong, has led more than one hundred staff members from the province to the town, disregarding the strong opposition of the local people and forcibly establishing bureaus and checkpoints to detain porcelain ships, leading to a porcelain merchant strike and kiln owners shutting down operations. More than one hundred thousand unemployed workers are marching and petitioning, which is likely to cause a major crisis. Moreover, Jingdezhen borders bandit areas, and alarms are frequent. We are deeply concerned that the unrest will escalate and disrupt local security. The consequences are unimaginable. In addition to reporting to the party and government authorities, we urgently request your departments to examine and approve, and immediately telegraph the Jiangxi Provincial Government to abolish the special production and sales tax on porcelain, etc., on a fixed date. The porcelain industry will be fortunate, and the local area will be fortunate." This town has suffered repeated bandit raids in recent years, and porcelain production has plummeted. Today, the Jiangxi Provincial Government is levying harsh taxes on this dying national product, causing a major disturbance and endangering the life of national porcelain. We urgently request assistance in order to achieve the goal of abolishing the tax. We are greatly looking forward to your assistance. Jingdezhen General Chamber of Commerce respectfully prays.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Japanese Military Invasion of Jehol Province <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Jehol Troops Resist Japanese Aggression and Retreat</p>
<p>Tang Pinglin Dispatches Dong's Brigade to Reinforce Chaoyang</p>
<p>According to reports from Beiping, following the clash between Japanese and Jehol troops in the area between Chaoyang Temple and Beipiao on the 18th, inquiries were made to Jehol by Beiping officials on the 19th and 20th.  The results proved that there was no fighting on those two days because the Japanese military ceased their military actions, so our troops also ceased resistance. However, yesterday (21st), the Japanese side publicized that representatives of the Jehol authorities were in contact with Japanese representatives to negotiate the rescue of Ishimoto and the restoration of the Beipiao branch line. Officials stated that they had not yet received formal reports and had telegraphed to inquire about the truth. However, it is generally speculated that the situation on the Jehol border has indeed eased and negotiations may be in progress. The following is a record of the Japanese military invasion of Jehol:</p>
<p>Ishimoto Goes Missing: The Japanese Yoda Brigade stationed in Jinxi, using the disappearance of the Japanese Ishimoto Kenshiro as an excuse, dispatched armored vehicles and air squadrons on the 18th to begin attacking the Jehol border. The air squadron also flew to Chaoyang and dropped more than 30 bombs. Official reports detailing our losses and the details of the conflict at Chaoyang Temple were received yesterday (21st). The Japanese Ishimoto Kenshiro was originally a businessman in Beipiao. After the Japanese military occupied Jinxi, the Japanese commander stationed in Jinxi appointed him as a military transport liaison officer, responsible for transportation on the South Manchuria Railway. Whether Ishimoto had recently been to Beipiao was not notified to the Jehol Provincial Government or the Japanese Consul stationed in Chifeng. If Ishimoto went to Jehol, he would have to obtain a residency passport from the consulate and, at the same time, notify local officials according to procedures. Since the location of Ishimoto's disappearance was within Liaoning territory, Jehol was unaware beforehand and naturally cannot be held responsible.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Opens Fire: At the same time, the Japanese, using the excuse that military trains were attacked by righteous volunteers, dispatched two armored trains carrying over 1,000 Japanese soldiers and equipped with 15-centimeter heavy artillery from the Japanese brigade headquarters in Jin County at 2:00 PM on the 18th. They drove into Chaoyang Temple Station, forcibly trying to head to Beipiao. At that time, the commander of the first battalion of Dong's brigade, Zhang Shouzhen, was responsible for protecting the railway from Chaoyang Temple to Beipiao. Commander Zhang believed that the Japanese armored trains were forcibly trying to head to Beipiao, and his troops had not received orders, so he immediately stopped them. The Japanese armored trains first fired more than ten shots as a show of force, intending to intimidate our small number of troops.</p>
<p>Our Troops Resist: At that time, Commander Zhang was about to negotiate with the Japanese officers on the armored trains when the Japanese suddenly opened fire with machine guns. Our side immediately resisted, and a fierce battle broke out. The location was near Chaoyang Temple. By 8:00 PM, the Jehol troops, due to their weak strength, concentrated all their forces on Nanling. Nanling is an important mountainous area on the Jinxi-Chaoyang branch line. There is a tunnel under the mountain through which trains can reach Beipiao. Due to the fierce resistance of our troops, the Japanese armored trains retreated to Chaoyang Temple Station and returned to Jin County. Commander Zhang's left leg was indeed slightly injured. The above is the actual situation of the conflict on the Jehol border.</p>
<p>Chaoyang Bombed: Regarding the bombing of Chaoyang by Japanese aircraft, according to County Magistrate Li's report, Japanese aircraft dropped a total of 34 bombs on the brigade headquarters, telegraph bureau, and mortar company in the county town. Among them, three mortar shells did not explode. Our side was caught off guard and did not have time to prepare. More than 30 soldiers and civilians were killed or injured, and more than ten military horses of the brigade headquarters were also killed. On the 19th, the Japanese military took no action. The Japanese brigade headquarters stationed in Jin County sent Staff Officer Yoshioka and Muta, the Japanese consul stationed in Chifeng, to the Jehol garrison to request that the disappearance of Ishimoto be investigated. It is said that Jehol Chairman Tang Yulin has dispatched Dong Futing's brigade to Chaoyang due to the Japanese military's harassment of the border.</p>
<p>Situation Eases: Yesterday (21st) at 4:00 PM, Meng Zhaotian, Jehol's military representative and deputy director of political training, personally used a long-distance telephone to inquire with Jehol. According to the reply, there was nothing wrong on the Jehol border today (21st), and the situation has eased. The Jehol troops are still at Nanling, and the Japanese military has not crossed the Jehol border by even one step. Chairman Tang is currently in Chengde, etc. This proves that the area east of Chaoyang is peaceful and without incident. As for the disappearance of Ishimoto, it will be clarified within a few days. The Jehol troops are also maintaining a considerable level of alert in the Beipiao area. As of the evening of the 20th, the Beipiao branch line train has not yet resumed traffic.</p>
<p>Tang Resolves to Resist: Yesterday, this reporter interviewed Meng Zhaotian, Jehol's military political training deputy supervisor and military representative, asking about the recent situation in Jehol Province. Meng made the following important remarks: This time, the Japanese military, using the Ishimoto disappearance issue as an excuse, dispatched five aircraft to Chaoyang to bomb at 2:00 PM on the 18th. The circumstances of our losses have been reported to me by Chairman Tang in a telegram. At the same time, military action also occurred at Chaoyang Temple Station, which is connected to Liaoning Province. Two Japanese armored trains forcibly tried to pass through and head to Beipiao. Our troops stopped them, and the Japanese military suddenly opened fire. Our troops had no choice but to resist. In the past two days, I have inquired with Song Juchuan, the director of the Jehol long-distance telephone bureau, via long-distance telephone. According to Director Song, the border area of Chaoyang Temple Beipiao is peaceful and the situation has eased. Our military defense is very solid. Chairman Tang Yulin believes that if the Japanese military invades Jehol territory, he will resolutely resist. Currently, the main force of our army has been concentrated at a suitable location. Chairman Tang has recently stated, "I have lived to be over sixty years old and will never commit acts of treason or betrayal. I do not want to be ridiculed by the world." (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e70">After the League of Nations Investigative Mission Arrived in Beiping <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>They Will Organize Materials and Prepare a Report</p>
<p>The Mission Is Highly Attentive to the Jehol Issue</p>
<p>According to reports from Beiping, the League of Nations Investigative Mission, consisting of more than twenty people, arrived in Jinan from Qingdao on the morning of the 20th and then split up to go to Beiping. Lytton and the French member, along with our Chinese representative Gu Weijun, flew north by plane, arriving at 11:00 AM that morning. After disembarking, Lytton, feeling slightly unwell, immediately took a car to the German Hospital to rest. The French member took a car to the Beijing Hotel, and Representative Gu also returned to his private residence in Tieshizi Hutong. The German, American, and Italian members, as well as the Japanese representative Yoshida and his entourage, also took a special train on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway from Jinan on the morning of the same day, arriving in Tianjin at 5:45 PM. They stopped for more than twenty minutes and then headed north to Beiping, arriving at 9:10 PM. It is reported that the attitude of each member upon returning from Japan is very different from that before going to Japan, perhaps due to the stimulation of the Japanese attitude. A representative stated that the steps planned by the investigation mission have achieved very few objectives and are very unsatisfactory. It is determined that the investigation mission report will be completed by the end of August. Furthermore, according to a spokesperson for the investigative mission who spoke to reporters, the materials obtained by the investigative mission in its investigation in the three northeastern provinces are still being organized and will be completed in the near future. The organization work is being carried out separately by the various expert members in cooperation with the secretaries. After all the materials have been organized, a drafting committee will be organized by the members to hold a meeting and discuss, and then work will begin on the preparation of the report. Currently, in terms of the time spent on organizing the materials, the drafting of the report will probably have to wait another ten days or so. Therefore, this is still the secretarial work period. After ten days, it will be the members' work period. It is believed that within ten days, each member may go to Beidaihe one after another in order to allocate work at that time. The Chinese side has submitted more than twenty types of memoranda to the investigative mission, and it is said that a small portion has not yet been delivered, and the number is unknown. The Japanese side has also submitted memoranda, all for the investigative mission's reference. The investigation mission is paying close attention to the problems that have occurred on the Jehol border, but it cannot make any comments. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan Armies Launch a General Offensive Against the Communist Bandits in Southern Jiangxi <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Troops from Five Provinces Encircle and Suppress the Communists on the Border of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian</p>
<p>Aimed at Meeting in Ruijin, the Fake Communist Capital</p>
<p>According to reports from Nanchang, a letter was recently received from Ganzhou stating that the Communist bandits who invaded Guangdong have been severely suppressed by the Guangdong army, suffering heavy losses. They have completely withdrawn to the areas of Xinfeng, Anyuan, Xunwu, and Huichang, with the bandits in western Fujian and eastern Jiangxi coordinating with each other. Although there are still remnants of bandits in Guangdong, they are covering the withdrawal of the Communist masses to Jiangxi. Currently, the three divisions of Zhou Zhirou, Liu Shaoxian, and Li Ming of the 18th Army of Jiangxi have fully arrived in Nankang and Dayu. In addition to stationing a portion of their troops in Ganzhou to secure the rear, the rest have joined the front lines. Wang Dongyuan's division of the Hunan Army, which advanced from Chongyi to Dayu, has also been incorporated into the battle sequence. It is said that the divisions of Miao Pei-nan, Zhang Da, Li Han, Wang Zanbin, etc. of the Guangdong and Guangxi armies have also completed their deployment and will launch a general offensive against the bandits in Xinfeng. The Guangdong army, with Miao Pei-nan's department as the vanguard, has already begun fighting at the junction of Nanxiong and Xinfeng. The Jiangxi and Hunan armies will launch a two-pronged attack from Nankang and Dayu to the northwest of Xinfeng. According to aerial reconnaissance reports, the bandits in Xinfeng and Sannan are covering the transport of baggage, heavy artillery, and looted supplies to Ruijin and Ningdu. The stretcher teams are continuously moving northeast from the Guangdong border. The Communist masses have no intention of fighting and seem to have other plans. However, the Central Government has made a final decision to suppress the bandits, and Chen Jitang of Guangdong has deeply realized that the Guangdong army must unite with the Central Army to suppress the bandits due to the losses of the Guangdong army in southern Jiangxi. Therefore, the armies of the five provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian have agreed to act in unison. Upon investigation of the defense lines of each province, the Guangdong border starts at Nanxiong and extends west to the Hunan border in Renhua and Lechang, and east through Lianping, Heping, Pingyuan, and Jiaoling to Heping in Fujian. This line is defended by the three armies of Xiang Hanping, Li Yangjing, and Yu Hanmou, and Wang Zanbin's division of the Guangxi army. The Jiangxi border starts at Dayu and extends from Nankang and Ganxian along the east bank of the Gan River through Wanbao, Xinghe, Ji'an, and Jishui, and then from Jishui, Yongfeng, Xiang'an, Xinghuang, and Nanfeng counties diagonally eastward to Jianning in Fujian. This line is extremely long. The area above Ganzhou is entirely defended by the 18th Army, and the area below Ganzhou and reaching Ji'an is defended by Wang Liande's troops. The area west from Yongfeng and east to Nanfeng, crossing the central part of Jiangxi Province, is guarded by the armies of Hao Menglin, Sun Lianzhong, and Mao Bingwen. On the Fujian Province side, its defense line against the bandits starts from Jianning and extends along Zhangping to Zhangzhou, and then through Yunxiao, Kehe, and connects with the Guangdong Eastern Jiang garrison. The 19th Route Army is the main attacking force. The above-mentioned forces from the five provinces, at least twenty or more divisions and approximately 200,000 or more men, will form a large encirclement around the Communist bandits on the border of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian, with Ruijin and Tingzhou as the meeting point. If a quick and complete victory can be achieved, the Communist bandits will definitely be eliminated. (July 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Fujian Province's Education Funds and Finances <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Education Fund Committee Proposes Guiding Principles</p>
<p>The Province's Finances Are Divided into Three Districts for Reorganization</p>
<p>According to reports from Fuzhou, under the Red Peril and the Zhang forces' warlordism in Fujian, education funds and finances are truly in dire straits and extremely impoverished. The Provincial Government and the Education Fund Committee are therefore planning to reorganize the province's education funds and finances as much as possible. At 10:00 AM on the 16th of this month, the Education Fund Committee held a meeting in the Provincial Government Conference Room. Fang Shengtao, Cheng Shih-jui, Chen Peikun, Deraeburg, and others attended. First, Cheng Shih-jui, Director of the Education Department, reported on the difficulties in allocating education funds over the years. Then, Chen Peikun, Director of the Education Fund Management Office, reported on the income and expenditure of education funds. Deraeburg, the assistant auditor, stated that he strongly supports the protection of education funds and would never suppress, save, or misappropriate them. Finally, three guiding principles were agreed upon: (1) Education funds should be allocated monthly, with 120,000 yuan as the guiding principle; (2) Unless there are extreme difficulties with salt taxes, education funding should remain unchanged as the guiding principle; (3) If changes are unavoidable, the amount should be approved by the Education Fund Committee. In general, education funding may not be as difficult as before. As for the financial aspect, the Provincial Government Committee previously proposed a plan to reorganize the province's finances by dividing them into districts and submitted it for review. The general idea of the plan is to divide the province into three districts, with one commissioner assigned to each district, responsible for reorganizing various tax revenues in the district and remitting tax revenues to the Finance Department, and reporting the reorganization progress and tax revenue status to the Provincial Government at any time. On the 15th of this month, the Provincial Government Committee reviewed and discussed the plan to reorganize finances by dividing them into districts, and decided that the first district would be based on the prefectures of Ningde, Fuan, and Xiapu; the second district would be based on the prefectures of Yancheng, Jianning, and Shaowu and a part of the Tingzhou prefecture; and the third district would be based on the prefectures of Zhangzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Yongchun, and Longyan. The detailed areas will be determined by a map. Each district will have one commissioner. The commissioners should be accompanied by staff selected from civil servants as a guiding principle. The rest will be handled according to the review report. However, the commissioner may establish an office in a suitable location in the district. The Provincial Government has also decided on the candidates for the commissioner: Shi Jialin (current Director of the Finance Department) will be the first district commissioner, Lin Jinan (current member of the Provincial Government) will be the second district commissioner, and He Gonggan (former Director of the Finance Department) will be the third district commissioner. An official order will be issued within a few days, and they will start working at the beginning of next month. (July 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Issue of the Qingdao Wharf Being Contracted to a Japanese Merchant <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Cleverly Defends Itself</p>
<p>The People Firmly Oppose</p>
<p>According to reports from Qingdao, the Municipal Government decided to contract the construction of the No. 5 Wharf of the Great Harbor in this city to the Japanese merchant Fukuchang Company. Although it has been repeatedly and firmly opposed by citizens of the city and people from all over the country, the Municipal Government still cleverly defends itself, claiming that although the project is contracted to a Japanese merchant, the rights and interests have not been transferred to foreigners. Because the contract stipulates that local Chinese workers must be hired, the cement is limited to Qixin's "Horse Brand," the stone is Laushan's granite, and the wood is Singapore's red hardwood. In fact, it is no different from Chinese people doing it themselves. However, may I ask, if our country's politics are also managed by the Japanese, and our Chinese people still eat rice and goods grown by Chinese farmers and use Chinese workers, how is this different from the facts? What should we say about this? Moreover, upon investigation, during the Japanese administration of Qingdao, they planned to repair and dredge the No. 1 Wharf of the Great Harbor and had already produced 624 large concrete blocks, each weighing 60 tons, but they were never used. When we took over Jiao'ao in the twelfth year, our Jiao'ao Public Administration bought them at the price of one million yuan in national currency. Unexpectedly, these blocks were never used, and most of them have been crushed and broken. They are currently piled up on the vacant land behind the Naval Factory in this city. Although our country has wasted a million yuan on this useless waste, it is fortunate that it has not been used for construction. Otherwise, once used, it would be difficult to guarantee that there would be no danger from the impact of the tide. Furthermore, although it is stipulated that Laushan gravel and Qixin cement should be used for this No. 5 Wharf, how can we know that they will not be replaced with Japanese cement and inferior gravel? The Municipal Government also said that the Japanese merchant Fukuchang Company won the bid with 3.9 million yuan. It is rumored that Kang Yi's bid price was 3.95 million yuan, including 60,000 yuan for underwater engineering excavation costs. The actual bid price was 3.89 million yuan. Therefore, various rumors have arisen, slandering the Municipal Government. Bao Kangyi does not specify 60,000 yuan for underwater engineering in its bid, which is purely a rumor, and there are various merchants' bids that can prove it. Regarding this point, the various Shanghai groups and the National Salvation</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Joint Conference once sent someone to Kang Yi's office to check the duplicate of the bid review, which clearly stated that the excavation cost for underwater engineering was five yuan per cubic meter, totaling 60,000 yuan. Moreover, Kang Yi had sent a letter to the Qingdao Municipal Government's Purchasing Committee explaining the necessity of the excavation. This point is an extremely important contribution to the project. In principle, the Municipal Government should be grateful for it, but now it is said to be creating rumors, what is the intention? It is inexplicable. Kang Yi has contracted many huge projects in Shanghai and has always had extremely harmonious feelings with our Chinese people, and one-third or more of the shares are held by Chinese people. How can there be such a thing as spreading rumors? Moreover, it has already been agreed with the Shanghai people that they would undertake it for 3.89 million yuan including excavation costs, but the Qingdao Municipal Government ignores this and disregards the people's opposition. I don't know what the intention of the officials of the Municipal Government is. I sincerely hope that the Municipal Government will give this issue very serious consideration.</p>

<p>Tax Police Training Institute Continues to Recruit Students: The Tax Police Officer Training Institute of the Salt Affairs Inspection General Office of the Ministry of Finance has been stationed at the gunpowder depot in Songjiang since its establishment to implement training. The head of the institute, Yao Guanshun, is a graduate of the US Army School with excellent academic qualifications and was valued by the late Premier. The instructors at all levels are also US graduates. The second phase of students will hold a graduation ceremony at the end of July, and the third phase will continue to recruit in early August to continue training. These students must be recommended by the salt affairs agency, be at least 21 years old and no more than 28 years old, be of good character and sound physique, and have received secondary education. They must submit a four-and-a-half-inch half-length photo, find a guarantor, and fill out a volunteer form, and the recommending agency must affix a seal to comply with the procedures.</p>
<p>A Thief Escapes After Contracting an Epidemic Disease: Wang Gengsheng, a thief who was not yet sentenced by the County Court, suddenly contracted an epidemic disease in the detention center. The warden, Hu Yaomei, immediately asked a doctor from Songjiang Hospital to treat him. The hospital was not equipped with saline injections, so he had to be transferred to the epidemic hospital. The warden, being serious about human life and preventing infection, immediately sent the prisoner to the Epidemic Hospital of the Red Cross branch for treatment. After the doctor diagnosed him and injected saline, the illness was greatly reduced, but the prisoner took advantage of the guards Zhang Yinqiu's unpreparedness to climb over the back wall while ill and escape. After the guards realized this, they urgently telegraphed the warden, reporting that they had been unable to track him down. It is learned that Warden Hu has not only reported this to the County Court but has also written to the County Public Security Bureau requesting a thorough investigation. The guard on duty has also been investigated by the Procuratorate.</p>
<p>Silk and Cloth Industry Investigates Enemy Goods: Since last year, under the guidance of the Anti-Japanese Association, the silk and cloth industry in this city has registered enemy goods, but they have not been imported again. Recently, there have been peddlers selling printed foreign cloth at reduced prices. After investigation by the industry, it was found that they were all enemy goods. After repeated negotiations, the peddlers voluntarily wrote a letter of repentance and promised not to sell them again. Unexpectedly, before a month had passed, the peddlers relapsed. Therefore, the silk and cloth industry convened a temporary meeting yesterday and decided to elect ten investigators to carry badges and cooperate with personnel sent by the Anti-Japanese Association to be responsible for the investigation in order to rectify the situation. In order to facilitate the execution of their duties, they have submitted a request to the party and government agencies to order them to protect them. The County Government immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to provide effective protection.</p>

<p>Discussing the Issue of Chongming and Qidong Joining Governance: Since Chongming and Qidong separated in the 16th year of the Republic of China, local funding has been greatly affected, and all undertakings have been difficult to promote. Disputes between tenants and landlords have repeatedly occurred on both sides (Note: Qidong is the former outer sand of Chongming). Local people have repeatedly petitioned the province to request joint governance, but there has been no appropriate resolution to date. The County Government of this county received an order from the province ordering the county to convene local people to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the separation and merger of Chongming and Qidong. After receiving the order, the County Government convened a temporary administrative meeting of the entire county in the County Government yesterday.

<p>Organizing a Special Epidemic Branch Hospital to Accommodate Sick Inmates: Since the beginning of summer in this county, the weather has been increasingly hot and humid, leading to rampant and widespread epidemics in urban and rural areas. Hospitals are overwhelmed with patients. Several inmates in the county jail, county government prison, prison outposts, and detention centers are dying daily from the epidemic. County Magistrate Chen, recognizing this urgent situation, besides establishing a special epidemic hospital at the Liu Gong Ancestral Hall in Xidun for initial treatment, convened the fourth joint prison meeting the other day. Attendees included committee members Hua Pu, Qian Zhongliang, Zhang Ruiqiang, Zhou Erkai, Yao Dixin, and Wang Li, a total of six people. The meeting was chaired by Chen Chuande. Discussion items included: (1) Regarding the proposal of how to prevent and treat inmates who suddenly fall ill with heatstroke due to the extreme heat and overcrowding, which makes timely treatment difficult, it was resolved to have Hua Pu find a suitable temple to organize a temporary special epidemic branch hospital to accommodate sick inmates for treatment. The expenses will initially be covered by donations from the committee members (an immediate donation of 75 yuan for medical expenses was made by the committee members). (2) Regarding the proposal of how to raise approximately one thousand silver dollars needed for additional prison expenses, which are especially tight, it was resolved to have the association print donation booklets and send them to committee members to solicit donations within a specified timeframe.</p>
<p>A shocking tale of a local ruffian cruelly murdering his own daughter: Tao Kunquan, a well-known local ruffian in Tu 551 of Tengchang Township, Eleventh District (Beixia Township) of this county, is by nature violent and domineering. The villagers fear him like a tiger. Last year, Tao was arrested and sent to the county court for trial. After his release upon completion of his sentence, he did not mend his ways. He began an illicit relationship with Jin, the wife of a villager surnamed Tao, living together as if they were husband and wife, completely neglecting his legal wife, Mao. Mao's daughter, Guiying, who is twelve years old, was abused by the concubine, Jin. Kunquan not only did not stop her, but also joined in the beatings and inflicted various cruel tortures. A week ago, Guiying was severely beaten by Jin and deprived of food and drink. By the day before yesterday, she was on the verge of death. Not satisfied, Jin and Kunquan dragged the girl to the open space in front of their house, tied her with iron bars on her back, and stretched her arms up, exposing her to the scorching sun all day. Around 10:00 PM, Guiying died from her injuries. After hearing this news, Bao Rongqing, the Tu head, reported it to the county court yesterday because the case involved a human life, which he could not conceal. He requested an investigation to verify the facts for further action.</p>
<p>Investigation of Rice Milling Factory's Adulteration of Rice with Stone Powder: Citizens Hu Jia and others reported that a rice milling factory was adulterating rice with stone powder after milling it to increase profits, harming the people. Citing the ban from last year's Executive Yuan, they petitioned the central and provincial authorities for a crackdown. The rice milling industry claimed that Hu and others had ulterior motives, fabricating claims to disrupt business. They petitioned the Ministry of Industry to send personnel to conduct an on-site investigation to clarify the truth. Minister Chen, upon receiving the petition, dispatched Wang Zhen, a technical specialist from the Central Industrial Testing Laboratory, and technician Yu Renhan to Wuxi the other day to conduct an on-site investigation. They met several times with representatives from the county government, chamber of commerce, and the rice milling industry association. On the 22nd, they invited representatives from the county party headquarters, county government, chamber of commerce, and rice and bean industry association to conduct a joint test at the Dexin Rice Mill. They tested both indica and japonica rice, using five, four, three, two, and one jin of powder per shi, as well as rice milled without powder. The representatives participated in the tests, which took an entire day to complete. The results showed that milling rice with five jin of powder per shi yielded eight dou four sheng seven he, and four, four jin yielded eight dou four sheng three he, and one jin yielded eight dou one sheng six he, while milling without powder yielded seven dou six sheng five he. A table was created showing capacity, weight and all representatives signed and sealed to distribute to all parties. Departments Commissioners Wang and Yu returned to Beijing immediately to report back.</p>

<p>A Young Woman Who Failed an Entrance Exam Jumps into the River: Yesterday afternoon, the ferry of Zhenyang Auto Company, heading to Liuyi, reached Taigu Lidang when a young woman, approximately eighteen or nineteen years old, suddenly jumped into the river. The ship's steward noticed this and immediately informed the captain, who stopped the ship. He threw lifebuoys and called for boatmen to rescue her. A boatman jumped into the river and rescued the woman. After receiving emergency treatment, she regained consciousness. When asked her name, she replied that her surname was Tang, her given name Feng, and that she was from Yangzhou. She had come to Zhenjiang to take a middle school entrance exam, but failed. Fearing being ridiculed upon returning to Yangzhou, she briefly lost her senses and jumped into the river. After being rescued, Tang was sent back to the Zhenjiang shore on the original ferry and then taken to the Fifth Precinct by the auto company. The precinct then sent the girl to the Sino-Western Hotel for temporary lodging. Later, the girl said that she had a cousin, surnamed Liu, who lived on Yantou Street in the city. Police were sent to Liu's residence to report the situation, and Liu took her back.</p>

<p>Construction of a School Building Causes Dispute: The Songjiaqiao Elementary School in the Eleventh District of this county was originally located in the Gongji Hall for over a decade. Last year, during a flood, the school building was completely destroyed. The county government ordered Yang Shishan, the education committee member of the Fifth School District, to be responsible for the construction. Yang hired workers to begin construction on the 16th of this month. Unexpectedly, Feng Zhaofu, a resident of Jiangdu County, came to stop the construction, claiming that the land was inherited from his ancestors. Yang sent a letter to the police team stationed in the town, requesting them to send two soldiers to maintain order. Feng then led a group of people to disarm the soldiers. One soldier was captured. Yang and Shao Hanqin, a special agent of the police team stationed in the town, have come to the city to report to the county government. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Li immediately wrote to the Jiangdu County government to arrest and interrogate Feng Zhaofu.</p>

<p>People Are Poor and Exhausted, Please Exempt Us from Harsh Taxes: Xiaoshan's eastern townships are silk-producing areas. This year, the silkworm season was disastrous, and the silkworm cocoons failed. The rural economy is in dire straits. In addition, the harvest of sandy soil cotton and soybeans has been reduced due to prolonged moldy rain. Lately, cries of hardship are heard everywhere, and the people are in a difficult situation. Therefore, they can only request exemption from various local donations. It is heard that most people cannot afford the self-government household donations collected by the township offices in the townships. After the establishment of the township offices, they are only focused on collecting donations from each household and provide no benefit to self-government. Moreover, the township chiefs collude with each other to oppress the people, which greatly violates Sun Yat-sen's teachings of rescuing and aiding the people. Currently, the people of various townships, unable to bear this harsh taxation, have sent representatives to the provincial government to petition for an immediate exemption to sustain the people's livelihoods.</p>

The boatman, Wang Fulin, wrote to the county chamber of commerce, requesting them to ask the merchants for reduced compensation for the losses. The cargo was 300 dan of white rice and 200 dan of sesame cakes belonging to Zhou Deyu and Shengyuan. Yesterday, the chamber of commerce summoned the directors of various businesses to hold a meeting to discuss solutions. In addition to the losses from salvaging and selling the goods at reduced prices, the boat owner will pay 350 yuan in full compensation and the rest of the loss will be accepted as bad luck by each business.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Zhu Jia-hua's Explanation Regarding the Current Government's University Consolidation Measures <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Merger of the Law and Education Colleges of Jinan University and the Suspension of Enrollment at the Women's College of Arts and Sciences and the Normal College of Peking University</p>
<p>Recently, Minister of Education Zhu Jia-hua gave an explanation regarding the merger of the Law and Education Colleges of Jinan University in Shanghai and the suspension of enrollment at the Women's College of Arts and Sciences, the Law College, and the Normal College of Peking University.</p>
<p>He stated, in brief, that in recent months, people in the national education sector, feeling the urgency of the national crisis, believe that education is the foundation of a nation. Although it is closely related to politics and economics and interacts with them, it cannot be separated. However, even in terms of education itself, the unsatisfactory state of education is an undeniable fact. People often express great opinions and seek reforms with admirable enthusiasm and insightful views. Summarizing opinions from various parties, the focus of discussion is that higher education should aim for enrichment rather than extravagance. It must raise the level of academic research and pay attention to the cultivation of practical talents, valuing quality over quantity. Secondary education should be closely aligned with social needs and provide relief for the national economy. It is believed that the proliferation of ordinary secondary schools is excessive and that vocational education should be expanded and improved to truly increase the productive capacity of society. Primary and social education should respond to the current environment and ensure that out-of-school children receive the necessary education in the shortest possible time. At the same time, efforts must be made to eliminate adult illiteracy. These opinions have become a unified call throughout the country. It is generally believed that education must break away from the traditional concept of cultivating scholar-officials and strive to meet the practical needs of the nation and society and the meaning of modern times. The Ministry itself, since the National Education Conference held in the nineteenth year, resolved to improve the national education program and also planned and compiled it accordingly. Recently, in light of the facts of recent years, the Ministry is also carefully studying and planning successively. However, this matter is of great importance and must be carefully and thoroughly planned. It is hoped that it can be brought to the public for discussion in the near future.</p>
<p>Now, only in terms of national and provincial universities and independent colleges, the poor performance of graduates, the low level of equipment, and the lack of academic competition are almost universal phenomena. However, what is most regrettable is the lack of direction and planning in running schools. Establishing universities and departments often ignores the objective environment and their basic foundations. They imitate each other, admire vanity, and engage in extravagance and specialization in superficiality. Setting courses and opening lectures often neglects the study of basic subjects and the reality of various disciplines, resulting in superficiality and complexity without regard for the system. These two factors cause the first problem: in the same area, universities established by the same government have overlapping departments. In terms of equipment, they all lack it. In terms of professors and teaching materials, they are often the same people and the same things. On the other hand, in a smaller city, the various colleges of liberal arts that do not require huge equipment costs strive to have everything. Even in an engineering college that requires huge equipment costs, departments of civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry, architecture, mining, and metallurgy must be complete, regardless of the equipment capacity or local needs. The second problem is that materials that can be encompassed in one subject of study are deliberately fragmented. Basic subjects are neglected, and novelty is pursued. Ordinary physics is not yet understood, but the theory of relativity must be studied. The history of economic thought is not systematically discussed, but the theories of figures such as Marx must be opened as a separate course. Based on these two factors, the extravagance, superficiality, complexity, and fundamental nature of the university are already like this, and scholars can understand the consequences. Given China's current human and financial resources, even if the government concentrates its efforts on running three or five universities, it is still worried that it will not be enough. Since the tenth year of the Republic, only the high-sounding slogans of the university reform movement have been seen, and the substantial progress of universities has been rarely seen. Those who talk about university education often blame the poor politics, the lack of funds, and the lack of career paths for graduates. Their words are indeed true. However, upon considering the situation, this is only a one-sided observation. Therefore, the rationalization, consolidation, and enrichment of universities is a very urgent and important issue. However, this matter is very complex and requires thorough discussion to obtain a proper and appropriate plan. Without the thorough understanding and joint efforts of those engaged in university education, it is not possible to improve academics. Academics are public property, and universities are institutions for academic research. They should not be privately owned or restricted by any person, history, or purpose other than academics. The era of truth and the future of culture are constantly illuminating us. The various unsatisfactory states of current university education are not entirely avoidable by any one school, nor should any one person be held responsible. Joint efforts must be made to continuously consolidate and enrich them in order to achieve a rational solution.</p>
<p>As for the government's decision to merge the Law College and the Education College of Jinan University and to suspend enrollment this year at the Women's College of Arts and Sciences, the Law College, and the Normal College of Peking University, it is not any strange fact, but merely one step in the consolidation work. The purpose of establishing Jinan University was to educate the children of overseas Chinese. The government, mindful of their virtuous labor, specially established this school. Some people believe that the children of overseas Chinese only need to set up separate primary and secondary schools to provide special education, and that there is no need to isolate them in universities. They should be integrated with domestic youth to learn more about the culture and customs of the motherland. In fact, most of the children of overseas Chinese who return to the country are educated in universities other than Jinan. Furthermore, more than half of the current students at Jinan are not children of overseas Chinese. This is another argument. Now, only in terms of merging the Law College and the Education College of the school, the school unfortunately suffered damage from the Japanese aggression. Although the government decided to hand over the disaster-stricken schools in Shanghai to the Post-War Relief Committee for overall relief, it is observed that the relief efforts of the committee may be difficult to compensate for the losses in a short period of time. Therefore, the school must adopt a policy of austerity and concentration in order to ensure that the effectiveness of education is not reduced. President Zheng has also made plans for the merger of academic departments. Shanghai is only seven hours away from Nanjing, where the national government is located and where political implementation originates. Many scholars of law and politics are also gathered in this place. Therefore, it is ordered to abolish the Law College and transfer the existing students to National Central University. As for the renaming of the Education College to the Department of Education, it is like the merger of the four departments of the Education College of Central University into one department. Renaming a college to a department does not mean disrespecting the study of education. University students studying education to prepare for teaching is excellent, and it is especially necessary for overseas Chinese youth. However, establishing a special college to study education subjects means that, on the one hand, there is a lack of research in basic arts and sciences subjects. How can one be a teacher without the study of other subjects besides education? On the other hand, if students specializing in education are allowed, where will they find opportunities for educational administration after graduation? In short, the purpose of Jinan University, in addition to academic research, is in fact to train teachers and develop business talents. In this regard, it is appropriate to retain the College of Arts, the College of Sciences, the College of Commerce, and the primary and secondary schools specially established for overseas Chinese children. Furthermore, using the funds from the original Law College and Education College to compensate for the disaster and enrich the content of the College of Arts, the College of Sciences, the College of Commerce, and the primary and secondary schools, the future is very promising.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Peking University has seven colleges with approximately 2,600 students. The College of Art and the College of Russian Language and Politics were ordered by the Ministry to stop enrollment in the nineteenth year and were gradually closed. Some people advocate that the Women's College of Arts and Sciences should be renamed a women's university to foster talent, taking into account family customs and the special strengths of women. Others believe that men and women are already admitted to all universities and colleges, and there is no need to establish any special university or college. This issue remains to be studied. Although both Peking University and Tsinghua University have established Law Colleges, some believe that the research in the Law Colleges of these two schools is focused on theoretical aspects, while the Law College of Peking University should focus on practical aspects in the future to cultivate legal talents for application. This is also an issue that remains to be studied. The Normal University has approximately 1,600 students and aims to train secondary school teachers. However, according to the current content, it is no different from ordinary universities and suffers from the problem of a mismatch between name and reality. Recently, some people have advocated that the Normal University should only admit university graduates who are interested in secondary school education to study education for one year. Others have advocated maintaining the current system and tailoring the curriculum to meet the purpose of serving as teachers. These issues cannot be easily decided. In general, the overlapping of departments in national universities in the area of Peking is obvious. The government is also extremely concerned about the inadequacy of equipment in Peking University and the Normal University, especially the unfortunate fire that occurred in the physics laboratory of the Normal University last year. In recent years, the two schools have repeatedly experienced unrest, and the complexity of the content has made those who run the schools feel deeply troubled. The government's decision to suspend enrollment at the Normal University and the Women's College of Arts and Sciences affiliated with Peking University was originally intended to facilitate the consolidation and improvement of the schools and colleges.</p>
<p>The enrollment of schools is originally a kind of educational plan. On the one hand, it must consider the needs of society, and on the other hand, the school must consider its own ease of educational effectiveness. The current common practice of schools is that each college and department has no choice, how can it be good? The original students of the Normal University and the Law College and the Women's College of Arts and Sciences of Peking University are already quite numerous, and there is also an oversupply of this kind of talent in society for a while, so suspending the recruitment of new students is a matter that should be done. One must know that enrollment is one plan of running a school. Whether a school or college should recruit new students and how many should be recruited should have a provision. The government's decision this time is not intended to be unfair. For example, the approval of the College of Engineering, the College of Agriculture, and the College of Medicine of Peking University to recruit students does not mean that the performance of these three colleges is better than other colleges. This is because there are not many such colleges in Peking, and the country is in great need of construction talents, and consideration must be given to the education of young people from all over the country.</p>
<p>In short, the government's consolidation measures for Central University, Labor University, Qingdao University, Jinan University, Peking University, and the Normal University have all been carefully decided after a very long period of discussion. All the measures for consolidation, reorganization, and suspension of enrollment seem to be negative actions on the surface. Those who have ill intentions may even criticize them as destroying existing education. In fact, the positive significance is extremely profound. Everything is for the convenience of the students' own studies and the convenience of those who are enthusiastic about running schools. Plans are made with the most careful consideration. Strict consolidation measures will also be adopted for all private universities in the future, so that young people throughout the country can have a genuine venue to pursue their studies and be useful to the country. The government is concerned about the national crisis and expects the universities to make a great contribution to the country. The expressions of people in the society in recent months also share this view. In short, the consolidation of universities is not a matter of one time, but requires long-term efforts, and it cannot be achieved by the government alone. It is hoped that those engaged in university education will work together to promote progress. Now that the government is in financial difficulties, it is striving to fully issue the funds for national universities and colleges from this month onwards to avoid reductions. Everyone sees the hard work involved. How will the performance of the universities be next year? It depends on our efforts today. The Ministry is responsible for education and is extremely willing to accept opinions from all parties on how to improve education in the future in order to achieve perfection. At the same time, for any decision of the government, it can only be implemented with sincerity and courage, without fear of labor or resentment.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Grass Court Tennis Group A Championship: China and Japan Compete for the Title <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Looking Forward to Wednesday's Decisive Battle</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Group A Championship has now become a contest between China and Japan. Based on recent results and the strength of both sides, Japan has taken a superior position. If China can display a spirit of dauntlessness and work hard to compete, then this glimmer of hope is not impossible to achieve the final victory. The warriors who bear the name of China should know the importance of their responsibilities. In the past six matches between the Chinese and Japanese teams, China won 66 sets and lost 24 sets, while Japan won 73 sets and lost 17 sets. In Wednesday's match, if China can win 11 to 4, then each side will have won 77 sets, resulting in a tie. If there is an even better result, such as 12 to 3, then China can take the lead. On the contrary, Japan only needs to win 5 sets to retain the title. The difficulty of the facts for both sides is like this, and the future result may not be what China hopes for.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Baseball Practice Match: China Loses to Mailing <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>China Lacks Training and Has Unfamiliar Skills</p>
<p>Mailing B Wins 8 to 2</p>
<p>The Chinese baseball team played a practice match against Mailing B yesterday at the Chinese baseball field. This was the Chinese team's debut since its formation. They lost due to seven errors. As a result, Mailing got ten hits and won 8 to 2. About 500 or 600 people watched, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. China's defeat was due to a lack of training, unfamiliar skills, and a disorganized lineup that was difficult to control. However, the talent is quite average, and if they can be given time to train, the future is very promising. The following is a record of yesterday's events.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Pitcher Wei Has Some Skill <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Chinese pitcher Wei Zongwei was formerly a pitcher for the Yokohama Chinese Baseball Association and is a second-class player in the Japanese overseas Chinese community (the first-class pitcher in the Japanese overseas Chinese community is Liu Sezhang, who is currently studying at Hosei University and has not yet enlisted). Yesterday, he struck out (three hits) eight times, matching Mailing's pitch Locke Zasa (four ball counts). Wei only gave up twice, while Mailing's pitch gave up six times. It is said that Wei's performance yesterday did not seem to be at its best.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Liang Brothers' Skills Are Outstanding <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Catchers Zhang Guoxun and Liu Dacheng were quite calm, but they were inevitably unfamiliar due to a lack of practice. First baseman Liang Fuchu is old but strong and worthy of his reputation as a general. He is in charge of issuing orders and has experience in commanding the line. Liang Chengshan, who is stationed at second base, is quick and nimble, has clever actions, and has a unique skill in stealing bases. The rest of the players are also of average quality. However, their batting skills are still lacking.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Mailing Scores Two Points in the First Three Innings <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The attack started at 4:20 pm, with Mailing batting first. Both sides were cautious and made no progress. In the second inning, Mailing scored two consecutive hits. Cowbell and Morgan returned to score two points. China attacked hard and Liang Fuchu reached third base. Wei Zongwei also occupied second base, but two people had already been eliminated, and Gu Degang's high ball was struck out, and all previous efforts were in vain. In the third inning, Mailing's Allart had a great opportunity to return to base from third base, but China's tight union kill was luckily not successful. China was still scoreless in this inning.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Mailing Wins Again with Repeated Hits <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Mailing continued to attack. Fliehmann threw a high ball that flew far into the back of the outfield, and Gu Degang failed to catch it. Then, Cowbell and Morgan each made hits. In addition, Liu Dacheng made a mistake, and the two returned to score two more points. China was still scoreless. At the end of the fourth inning, Mailing won with a score of 4-0. In the upper half of the fifth inning, Mailing's momentum was even stronger, with continuous hits and bases full of power. Fortunately, China worked hard and Wei Zongwei displayed his skills to eliminate Mailing without success. China also did not gain any points.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Zongwei's Hit, Li and Gu Return <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>After Mailing's unsuccessful change of formation in the sixth inning, China worked hard to counterattack. Liu Dacheng got a base on balls, Zhang Zhaoyuan released a hit, and each occupied one base. When Liang Fuchu got to first base, Liu Dacheng was killed at third base. Then, Li Beiliang released a long ball, and Zhang Zhaoyuan rushed back to home base, but Mailing's left fielder had already sent the ball to home base, and Zhang was unfortunately touched out. Fortunately, Wei Zongwei got a hit, and the ball flew far to the right field. Gu Degang replaced Liang Fuchu and ran back to home base, and Li Beiliang also returned, scoring two points. The audience cheered.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Mailing Continued to Score Five Hits <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>In the final seventh inning, China was very depressed. Mailing scored five consecutive hits, and each base was occupied. Enemy Buxel, Simen, Hailang, and Fliehmann returned to score four more points. China persevered and Liang Chengsong stole a base and advanced to third base, hoping to return, but An Lesheng (pinch hitter) was killed because of his risk, and all previous efforts were in vain, which was very regrettable. As a result, China lost 2-8. The game was judged by umpire Carroll and the base umpire was Mullen, and the game ended at 6:10 pm, lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes. The score for each inning is as follows:</p>
<p>Mailing ○ 2 ○ 2 ○ ○ 4 8 points Innings 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th Summary</p>

<p>France's Lacoste Does Not Participate</p>
<p>Paris Telegraph, 23rd: The second day of the US-Germany match was the doubles match between the American team of Van Ryn and Hall vs. the German team of Cramm and Prellwitz. It rained in the morning, but the court was completely dry when the match started at 3:15 pm. At the beginning of the match, the American team controlled the game, making the opponents submit without being able to escape. Cramm was the focal point of the attack. Van Ryn's ball was very fast. As a result, the American team won 6-3, 6-4, 6-1. After two days, the United States led 2-1. The last two singles matches were the American Vines vs. the German Cramm and the American Shields vs. the German Prellwitz. If the United States wins one of the two matches, they will win the Interzonal Championship and play against France. Paris Telegraph, 23rd: French tennis star Lacoste is suffering from pharyngitis.

<p>Some staff are left to handle unfinished matters. The Shanghai Withdrawal Zone Takeover Committee was dissolved yesterday because the Japanese troops had completely withdrawn. All personnel have been dismissed. However, in order to handle unfinished matters, Cha Nanqiang, the special commissioner of the committee, and Li Mo, the secretary, and six other people have been left to handle incoming and outgoing documents and miscellaneous matters in the committee. Yesterday, the committee handed over all documents to the municipal government for preservation. As for the takeover records, they are expected to be temporarily unable to be published because of the lack of photos and loss statistics. The committee also sent an administrative report on everything to the authorities yesterday. Because the committee members worked very hard, the authorities plan to award them honorary prizes.</p>

<p>A large number of postal personnel were ordered to withdraw and enter the pass The Japanese instigated the puppet state to take over and issue counterfeit new stamps A temporary post office was set up at the Japanese Consulate in this city to send letters Because the Japanese instigated the puppet state to sabotage and harass the Northeast Post Office, the Ministry of Communications ordered the General Post Office to implement the blockade, and ordered all postal personnel in the area to leave the bureau. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The news from yesterday is recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Japanese Seize the Eastern Provinces Postal Bureau <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese had already established Japanese postal bureaus within the South Manchurian Railway Zone in northeastern China. The area along the South Manchurian Railway was designated as a Japanese postal district. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have been plotting to seize our country's postal affairs, secretly preparing vigorously. However, due to incomplete preparations, they delayed implementation. After our country ordered a blockade and the withdrawal of postal personnel from various districts in the Northeast, the Japanese openly proceeded with the takeover, with everything directed by the Japanese Fujiwara, the head of the puppet state's postal administration. According to sources in the postal circles in this port, the Japanese are gradually taking over various postal bureaus and are expected to complete the takeover within days.</p>
<p>A large number of postal workers are leaving their posts. The northeastern postal districts are divided into two: the Liaoning District and the Jilin-Heilongjiang District. After receiving orders from the General Post Office, they have been withdrawing one after another. Currently, the Liaoning District Postal Director, Italian Bali Di, and the Jilin-Heilongjiang District Postal Director, British Smith, have issued orders to their subordinate postal personnel to leave their posts and return to the interior. As for the lower-level staff, most of them were hired locally after passing examinations, so they remain in place and are not withdrawing. The northeastern postal personnel have telegraphed the Shanghai General Post Office regarding the withdrawal situation.</p>
<p>New Postal Stamps Discovered in the Rebel Areas After the withdrawal of personnel from the Northeastern Postal Bureau, the Japanese incited rebels to take over. The puppet organization is now creating postal stamps, which have been discovered within our borders. The printing and platemaking are entirely handled by the Japanese. The designs are very similar to Chinese postal stamps. The images printed on the stamps include pagodas and portraits of Puyi. The denominations on the stamps include one cent, two cents, four cents, five cents, ten cents, twenty cents, fifty cents, one yuan, two yuan, and many other denominations. Currently, letters within the rebel areas can still be delivered as usual by the puppet state, but letters sent to the interior are blocked by our country's postal authorities and cannot be delivered.</p>
<p>The General Post Office Telegraphs the Ministry of Communications This Port</p>
<p>The General Post Office has been quite busy in recent days with the issue of blockading postal services outside Shanhaiguan, working through the night with lights burning. Yesterday was Sunday, normally a day off, but the bureau still operated as usual. Director Huang telegraphed the Ministry of Communications regarding the situation after the blockade.</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Establishes Temporary Post Office The Japanese</p>
<p>authorities stationed in Shanghai were greatly alarmed after hearing the news of the blockade of the northeastern postal service. Yesterday morning, they held a meeting to discuss establishing a temporary post office within the Japanese Consulate to collect mail from Japanese residents and transport it to the three northeastern provinces via the Dalian Steamship Company, to mitigate the inconvenience after the blockade.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Continuous Meetings Held by Song Ziwen <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Northeast Customs</p>
<p>and the Abolition of Taels and Currency Reform</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, after arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before, immediately summoned Chief Inspector of Customs Frederick Maze, Director of Customs Zhang Fuyun, and senior Chinese and foreign personnel from both Customs administrations. They held continuous meetings at the Song residence to discuss how to deal with the rebels seizing Northeast customs duties. At the same time, he summoned Bei Songsun, Li Fusun, and others from the Shanghai banking and financial circles to discuss implementing the abolition of taels and currency reform. Significant progress has been made in both areas.</p>
<p>Northeast Customs Regarding Responding to the Rebels’ Seizure of Customs Duties The Minister of Finance believes that customs revenue from the three northeastern provinces is related to the entire national finances and absolutely cannot allow external interference. Moreover, Northeast customs revenue involves domestic and foreign debt issues. Our country should strive to recover it, and all related countries should pay close attention to it. After days of discussion by Minister Song and others, considerable results have been achieved. At 10:00 AM yesterday, foreign advisors such as Mr. Yang of the Customs were summoned again. Steps have reportedly been formulated regarding the blockade of the Northeast customs and the dismissal of Japanese employees of various customs offices, but they cannot be announced before implementation.</p>
<p>Abolition of Taels and Currency Reform The financial authorities have repeatedly discussed the issue of abolishing taels and reforming the currency with various banking and financial circles and experts in this port to rectify the domestic currency system. During this trip to Shanghai, Song summoned Bei Songsun, Li Fusun, and others from the Shanghai banking and financial circles the night before and discussed the matter in detail for two hours. It is now known that Song is very busy discussing Northeast customs and planning funds for suppressing bandits, so the issue of abolishing taels and currency reform will be temporarily handled by Deputy Minister of Finance Zhang Shouyong in consultation with the Shanghai banking and financial circles. Therefore, Zhang consulted with Hu Mengjia of the Bank of Communications and others on methods yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Suppression of Bandit Funds As a result of the previous discussions between President Wang and Finance Minister Song in Shanghai regarding funds for suppressing bandits, the monthly increase was 1.5 million yuan. Song’s trip to Wuhan to visit Chiang Kai-shek was to report in detail on the progress of planning the funds for suppressing bandits. Therefore, Song’s most important task in coming to Shanghai this time is to plan these funds and the issue of Northeast customs duties. Therefore, he has been meeting with the Shanghai banking and financial circles in recent days, and it is reported that a solution has been largely reached.</p>
<p>Will Go to Kuling According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Finance Minister Song Ziwen rested at his residence all day yesterday and did not go out. Among those who visited in the morning was Advisor Yang of the Ministry of Finance. It is said that they continued to discuss the blockade of Northeast customs. No guests visited in the afternoon. As for the news that came from the banking circles the day before, claiming that Minister Song would host a banquet for the banking and financial industries last night to continue negotiating on military spending for suppressing bandits and the abolition of taels and currency reform, Xin Sheng News Agency reporters inquired at the Song residence yesterday and were told that this was not the case. It is not clear whether it was a misunderstanding by the banking circles or a temporary suspension. However, according to reliable sources, Minister Song will return to Nanjing this week and then go to Kuling. There are also reports that he will leave today.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Various Organizations' National Salvation Associations Sent a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yesterday <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Asking to Maintain the Original Intention and Instruct Various Industries</p>
<p>To Continue to Persist in Resisting Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The United Association of National Salvation Organizations sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which stated: "To the respected addressee, since Japan forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces last year on September 18th, our countrymen have been motivated by patriotic enthusiasm to launch a movement to resist Japanese goods. Although this is insufficient to fully resist Japan, it is enough to strangle its economy. However, since the cessation of hostilities in Shanghai, Japanese goods have gradually increased, and the recent import volume has exceeded the first place. This kind of five-minute enthusiasm is truly a great shame for our people. Your chamber is the leader of the city's industry and commerce, and we have always admired your patriotic enthusiasm. We should maintain our original intention, continue to persist in the movement to resist Japanese goods, and hope to formulate concrete measures to be implemented effectively by various industries without the slightest slackening, with the aim of being long-term and enduring. We cannot help but express our utmost expectations. We hereby send this letter, hoping that you will investigate and take appropriate action."</p>

<p>Telegraphing the Japanese Government to Negotiate the Double Taxation</p>
<p>Telegraphing Honjo Shigeru to Invade Our Rehe Province</p>
<p>Petitioning the Japanese Consulate to Prohibit Anti-Japanese Activities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Residents' Affairs Committee held a committee meeting at the Japanese Club on the afternoon of the 23rd regarding the issue of our side's blockade of Northeast customs, double taxation, and the invasion of Rehe by Japanese troops outside Shanhaiguan. According to reporters from the Shi Wen News Agency, the results of the meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Results All the Japanese residents in Shanghai paid great attention to the committee meeting convened by the Affairs Committee on the 23rd, and the discussion on our side's blockade of Northeast customs was particularly detailed. Therefore, this meeting of the Japanese Residents' Affairs Committee lasted from 1:00 PM to 6:30 PM before it adjourned. The results of the discussion were: (1) Regarding the Chinese government's blockade of Northeast customs and double taxation, it was resolved to issue a letter to friendly foreign merchants and a declaration. It was also resolved to send a telegram to the Japanese government, requesting it to negotiate with the Chinese government to abolish them. (2) Regarding how to assist the troops outside Shanhaiguan in invading Rehe Province, it was resolved to: (A) send a telegram to Commander Honjo, congratulating him on his final efforts to thoroughly implement the Japanese government's immigration policy; (B) request that Hayashi Yoshio promptly go to Shanhaiguan to comfort the troops. (3) Regarding the anti-Japanese tide in this port, it was resolved to send three representatives to meet with Consul Murai and request that he negotiate with the municipal government to strictly prohibit it.</p>
<p>Telegraphing Honjo Of the above three resolutions, the letter to friendly foreign merchants and the declaration have not yet been drafted and issued. The two telegrams to the government authorities and Commander Honjo of the Kwantung Army were sent yesterday in the name of the Japanese Residents' Affairs Committee. The original telegram to Honjo contained more than 500 characters. The gist of it is translated as follows: (omitted above) In short, the unprovoked sacrifice of Kwon Shiro Ishimoto (?) is enough to damage the prestige of our great Japanese Empire in China. Moreover, the murderers of Kwon Shiro Ishimoto are organized bandits (?). These bandits are indirectly commanded by Zhang Xueliang and directly ordered by Tang Yulin of Rehe. Therefore, whether the past glory of our great Japanese Empire can be restored and whether the lives of countless Japanese residents in China can be guaranteed depend entirely on whether there is a good outcome of this negotiation. All the residents of Shanghai wholeheartedly support our army's immediate occupation of Rehe to avenge Kwon Shiro Ishimoto. Moreover, the immigration policy of our government is being actively implemented, and we should take this opportunity to thoroughly implement this policy to cultivate potential strength. (omitted in the middle) The Japanese residents of Shanghai, in order to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers defending the country outside Shanhaiguan, have now appointed Representative Hayashi Yoshio to go there to comfort them. As soon as the comfort bags are made, they will set off immediately. All the residents of Shanghai respectfully wish your excellency commander the last effort with the most sincere attitude. (omitted below)</p>
<p>Telegraphing the Japanese Government Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have unanimously refused to purchase Japanese goods, and the anti-Japanese tide is like a raging fire that cannot be stopped, especially after the January 28th Incident. All the Japanese merchants in Shanghai have been hit by this and have gone bankrupt and closed their businesses until now. Their painful situation is not enough for outsiders to understand. After the cessation of hostilities in Shanghai, our Japanese merchants in Shanghai have lost all their property due to the war and cannot return to the state before the January 28th Incident. The anti-Japanese tide of the Chinese people in Shanghai has not subsided slightly. Although some merchants have tried their best to restore their original businesses, it is quite difficult to maintain them due to the sluggish business. (omitted in the middle) How can we tolerate the Chinese government's double taxation to eliminate the existing power of our Japanese merchants in China? The name is to resist Manchuria's seizure of the Dalian Customs, but it is actually a public scheme by the Chinese government to reject the transportation of Japanese goods to China. We should ask the government to promptly appoint a senior official to negotiate seriously with the Chinese government to achieve the goal of abolishing double taxation to relieve the suffering of our merchants in China. (omitted below)</p>
<p>Scheduled Petition The three representatives who were selected at the Japanese Residents' Affairs Committee meeting on the 23rd to petition the Japanese Consulate to prohibit anti-Japanese activities held a discussion meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss the greatest purpose and date of the petition. It is said that considerable measures have been taken. The greatest purpose of the petition, in addition to requesting the Japanese consul to negotiate with our municipal government to abolish the anti-Japanese tide, also includes another issue (because the Japanese side's seal is tight and cannot be found out). The date of the petition is scheduled for 10:00 AM the day after tomorrow (the 27th).</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Money Industry Joint Reserve Fund Was Fully Paid Up Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Officially Established on August 2nd The Executive Committee Met Yesterday to Discuss the Articles of Association The Shanghai money industry reserve bank, which was resolved to be established by the money industry association and is being actively carried out, is scheduled to be established on August 2nd. The 30 million yuan fund was fully deposited in the bank yesterday morning. The details are as follows: Scheduled Establishment The articles of association of the money industry joint reserve bank were drafted yesterday by Qin Siqing, the secretary-general of the money industry association. The content is very detailed. Qin graduated from a foreign business school, has studied financial theory, and served as the manager of the Hankou Zhongfu Bank for more than ten years. He has rich experience. Since taking office as the secretary-general of the association, he has become particularly familiar with the situation in the money industry. Therefore, he is naturally able to handle all the designs for organizing a joint reserve bank with ease. The reserve bank has now decided to hold a members' representative meeting at the Ningbo Road Money Industry Association at 2:00 PM on August 2nd to formally establish the bank and elect committee members.</p>
<p>Fund Deposited The special property management committee of the money industry association has completely ended and stopped working. All the staff are preparing for the joint reserve bank. As for the reserve amount of the reserve bank, it is stipulated to be more than 30 million yuan. Among them, the value of the property is estimated to be more than 27 million yuan, and the fund of the former property management committee has been transferred. The cash portion of 3 million yuan was sent to the money industry treasury for storage by the various money houses before 10:00 AM yesterday, which shows the determination of the money industry to improve this time. If they can persevere and struggle to the end, the results in the future will be considerable. As for the location of the reserve bank, it will be in a new building next to the Tongyuan Bank on Tianjin Road.</p>
<p>Reviewing the Articles of Association The money industry association held an executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. All the committee members, including Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, Chuan Songnian, Pei Yunqing, etc., attended. Qin Runqing chaired the meeting and reported on the progress of preparing the reserve bank. Then, the draft articles of association were discussed. Due to the importance of the matter, it was resolved to appoint Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, Wang Huailian, Xie Fufu, and Hu Xisheng as review committee members. They will be passed at the members' general meeting on August 2nd.</p>
<p>Establishment Mission Xin Sheng News Agency reporters met with Qin Xieqing, the secretary-general of the money industry association, yesterday. According to him, the money industry guild draft houses and yuan-character colleagues have joined the joint reserve bank. The bank was specially established to consolidate the credibility of the entire industry, and its mission is to regulate the financial market and become a permanent organization. The reserve funds paid are: (A) cargo warehouse receipts that can be priced immediately; (B) real estate with a valuation; (C) cash currency or cash notes; (D) existing treasures or existing foreign currency. The committee members will properly evaluate the deposited property, and if the price falls in the future, they must still notify them to replenish it.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Disaster Area Recovery Committee Requests Again to Issue Relief Vouchers <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Disaster Area Industry and Commerce Recovery Committee submitted a request to the Executive Yuan yesterday to quickly issue relief vouchers.</p>
<p>Submitting a document again to request the issuance of relief vouchers to facilitate circulation and benefit recovery, please examine and approve the matter. The undersigned association, in order to promote the early recovery of industry and commerce in the disaster area, previously submitted a document stating the reasons and requesting the issuance of 30 million yuan of relief vouchers. However, two weeks have passed and no clear order has been received for approval, causing the industry and commerce in the disaster area to have no hope of recovery. The undersigned association sighs in despair. Moreover, the extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster are truly rare in history. If relief measures are not taken quickly, the livelihoods of the people will be cut off and the future consequences will be precarious. Enlightened figures like your excellency, the officials of the Executive Yuan, will certainly be aware of this. The undersigned association did not want to repeatedly pester with meaningless words, but only because what we witnessed broke our hearts and the disaster-stricken people are unable to plan for recovery. If we continue to follow this path, the industrial and commercial enterprises in the Songhu area will be forever in an unrecoverable situation. Thinking of the future, we cannot help but feel heartache. Therefore, we are not afraid of being presumptuous and submitting a document again, earnestly requesting your excellency to have compassion for the disaster situation and quickly approve it, so that the industry and commerce in the disaster area can plan for recovery as soon as possible and see the results. We humbly request your examination and approval, which would be both beneficial to the public and to private interests. We respectfully submit this to the Executive Yuan.</p>

<p>So That Customers Can Easily Recognize Them The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notified Various Industry Associations Yesterday: To The Respected Addressee, On The 22nd Of This Month, We Received A Letter From The China International Trade Association, Stating That Our Country's Industry And Commerce Are Still Nascent, And Domestic Products Are Insufficient To Supply The Needs. It Is Necessary To Transport And Sell Necessary Foreign Goods To Meet Domestic Demand. Moreover, World Transportation Is Becoming More And More Convenient, And International Trade Is Growing. It Is Natural To Exchange What One Has For What One Needs. However, There Are Differences In The Quality Of Imported Goods, And There Are Differences In The Nationalities Of Manufacturers. Merchants Have No Preferences For Good Or Bad In Their Pursuit Of Profit, And Customers Have No General Psychology In Their Selection Of Superior Products. Recently, The Market Is Flooded With Foreign Goods, But The Sellers Do Not Indicate Which Country The Goods Are From Or Which Factory Made Them. Buyers Often Have To Ask, And They Often Fail To Answer Properly, Which Leads To A Loss Of Affection And Damage To Transactions. The Beginning Is Small, But The Impact Is Great. Moreover, The Reason Why Our Country's Industry And Commerce Are Backward Is Not Just One End, But Self-Containment And A Lack Of Progress Are The Most Important Reasons. If Stores And Customers Can Pay Attention To Comparing Various Imported Goods And Study The Advantages Of Each, They Can Also Take This Opportunity To Correct Mistakes, So That The Industrial Sector Can Intend To Improve What They Already Have And Carefully Imitate What They Do Not Have. It Is Not Difficult To Develop Industry, And Leakage Can Be Slightly Blocked. The Fifth Board Of Directors Of Our Association, Based On The Above Reasons, Resolved To Suggest That Your Association Be Requested To Inform Various Industry Associations To Label The Foreign Goods They Sell With Their Country Of Origin Within The Possible Range, So That Customers Can Recognize Them And Provide Reference For Entrepreneurs. We Send This Letter Accordingly, Hoping That You Will Investigate And Handle It And Show Your Public Friendship, Etc. It Is True That The Above-Mentioned Requirement That Stores In Various Industries Should Label The Foreign Goods They Sell With Their Country Of Origin So That Customers Can Easily Recognize Them And Entrepreneurs Can Use Them As A Reference Is Indeed Beneficial To The Domestic Industrial And Commercial Circles. We Send This Letter In Accordance With The Situation Of The Letter, Hoping That Your Association Will Investigate And Advise Your Members To Follow And Implement It Within The Possible Range. This Is What We Expect.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Song Shi, Director of the Shanghai Arsenal, Resigned <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Arsenal Affairs Are Temporarily Handled by Liu Shouyu, According to Datong News Agency: The new factory site of the Shanghai Arsenal was previously surveyed and determined to be Xucun, Hangzhou. Later, Hong Zhong, director of the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of War, believed that Hangzhou was not suitable for establishing a factory, so he went to Wuhan to ask Chiang Kai-shek for instructions, advocating moving to Nanjing. Chiang reportedly agreed in person. Now, the order from the Ministry of Military Administration has arrived, ordering the relocation and merger of the medicine manufacturing, gun manufacturing, bullet manufacturing, shell manufacturing, and machine manufacturing factories to Jinling. The Ordnance Department then ordered the factory to expedite the completion of the closure. Song Shi, the director of the factory, had previously submitted his resignation to the Ordnance Department, which is said to have been approved. The arsenal affairs are temporarily handled by Liu Shouyu, director of the Engineering Department. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Zhong Advocated Moving to Nanjing The new factory site of the Shanghai Arsenal was originally surveyed and determined to be Xucun, 20 miles from Hangzhou. After the new factory site was surveyed, senior officials of the factory convened a work conference and drafted a plan for the construction of the new factory in Xucun, which was submitted to the military department for review. Later, Hong Zhong, director of the Ordnance Department, believed that Hangzhou had a prosperous business and that it was not suitable to build a factory there. Therefore, he personally went to Wuhan to visit Chiang Kai-shek and explained the situation, advocating starting construction in Nanjing. Chiang reportedly nodded in agreement. Hong then returned to Nanjing and telegraphed Hu Sihong, director of the Review and Inspection Department of the Shanghai factory, and Lin Weirong, director of the Bullet Factory, to go to Nanjing. At that time, Hu and others were still unaware that the plan to move to Hangzhou had been changed, so they still carried the previous plan to Nanjing. Later, Director Gang explained that the original plan had been changed and held concrete discussions in the Ordnance Department. Because the Ministry of Military Administration had not yet issued a clear order, Hu and others first returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Ordnance Department Ordered the Closure The Ministry of Military Administration considered the relocation of the factory to Nanjing to be feasible, so it has been approved. After receiving the order, the Ordnance Department telegraphed the factory on the 21st to comply. The telegram read, "According to the order of the Ministry, the machines of the gun manufacturing, medicine manufacturing, bullet manufacturing, shell manufacturing, and machine manufacturing factories will be relocated and merged to Jinling. You should comply." On the same day, the factory was also telegraphed to expedite the completion of the closure. The telegram read, "The factory has been ordered by the Ministry to relocate and merge to Jinling. You should expedite the completion of the closure in order to facilitate the relocation. During the closure period, the original employees should continue to serve as before. After the new factory is established, they will be re-evaluated and retained or dismissed. You should announce this to all."</p>
<p>Song Shi Resigned Song Shi, the director of the factory, became very passive after the January 28th Incident and the relocation of the factory's machines to Hangzhou. Therefore, before leaving Shanghai to go to Qingdao to avoid the summer heat, he submitted his resignation to the Ordnance Department and handed over the arsenal affairs to Liu Shouyu, director of the Engineering Department, as his agent. The Ordnance Department is said to have approved Song's resignation, and Liu Shouyu is to temporarily handle the arsenal affairs. Since the closure is imminent, Song has been telegraphed to return to Shanghai to handle the handover. Liu's trip to Nanjing was to request instructions from the Ordnance Department regarding the closure of the factory. It is said that the factory's employees expressed dissatisfaction with the relocation to Nanjing, so they sent Liu as a representative to Nanjing to discuss the matter with the Ordnance Department, which is completely inaccurate.</p>
<p>Artillery Factory Moved to Hanyang The factory originally had seven factories: artillery manufacturing, gun manufacturing, medicine manufacturing, bullet manufacturing, shell manufacturing, machine manufacturing, and steelmaking. After the steelmaking factory was separated by order of the Ordnance Department, there were still six factories left. This time, in addition to the gun manufacturing, medicine manufacturing, bullet manufacturing, shell manufacturing, and machine manufacturing factories, which were ordered to move to Nanjing, the artillery manufacturing factory continues to work as usual because the repair works have not been completed. As soon as the work is completed, the machines of the factory must be merged into Hanyang.</p>

<p>Zeng Zhongming, Deputy Minister of Railways, came to Shanghai again yesterday. After getting off the train at the North Station at 8:00 AM, he returned to his residence to rest. He visited Wang’s residence twice, in the morning and afternoon, but only stayed for a few minutes before leaving. Guo Wen reporters visited Zeng's residence in the afternoon and asked him about the Rehe alarm and various railway matters. Zeng had a conversation with them as follows: (Reporter asked) What is the purpose of your visit, sir? (Answer) There is no special matter. However, today Director Chen Xinghan came to meet me, and I accompanied him to inspect the North Station and the Songhu Road area. (Question) There are conflicting reports from Nanjing and Beijing about the Rehe incident. What is the latest situation? (Answer) The Japanese advance in Rehe was indeed very tense before, but it has calmed down in recent days. (Question) What is the Ministry of Railways' opinion on the transfer of the Songhu Railway to the city? (Answer) This matter was discussed yesterday (the 23rd) at a meeting of personnel from both railways convened by the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing. Roughly speaking, there must be a specific method to await the decision on the relocation of the North Station site. The Ministry of Railways will hold another meeting in Nanjing next Saturday (July 30), at which time the Shanghai Municipal Government will also be invited to send personnel to Nanjing to discuss it together. (Question) Then, judging from the current situation, can the Songhu Railway section be transferred to the city? (Answer) This cannot be answered in advance. Everything must wait for the situation after the meeting next week to decide. (Question) What about Zhang Jingjiang and others' proposal to expedite the construction of the Zhawu Railway? (Answer) Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, and Wu Zhihui proposed the day before yesterday that a light railway be built from Zhapu to Wuhu and assigned to merchants to manage. After consideration by the Ministry of Railways, it was considered feasible. The total cost of the entire line is estimated to be several million yuan. However, since the railway is managed by merchants, all construction plans are still handled by the original proposer, and the Ministry of Railways only reviews the plans, refers to opinions, and assists in the progress. At this point, the reporters bid farewell.</p>

<p>To Be Submitted When It Expires in April Next Year</p>
<p>The Most Important Points Are Bailiffs and Prisons</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Local Court Agreement will expire on April 1 next year. The Ministry of Judicial Administration is currently preparing revisions. It is understood that in addition to the Special District, there are also the Higher Court Second Branch of the Public Concession, the Higher Court Third Branch of the French Concession, and the Second Special District Local Court. The agreements of these three courts will also expire at the same time. When the time comes, not only will the First Special District Court Agreement need to be revised, but the agreements of the other three courts will also be revised at the same time. According to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the candidates for revising the agreement have not yet been decided, but the scope of the revision includes the following:</p>
<p>(1) Police Power: Currently, the judicial police power of the court is in the hands of foreigners. All arrests, searches, and other matters must be done through foreigners, which is quite inconvenient for command. In the future, when the agreement is revised, this police power will be returned to the jurisdiction of the court, and the police station will be in a supporting position.</p>
<p>(2) Lawyer's Rights: According to Chinese law, foreign lawyers are not allowed to appear in Chinese courts. However, due to the provisions of the agreement, foreign lawyers can appear in court to defend Chinese and foreign cases. After the agreement is revised, the right of foreign lawyers to appear in court will no longer be allowed to exist.</p>
<p>(3) Prison Rights: Currently, the prison laws of the courts, the French Concession Higher Third Branch, and the Second Special District Local Court have been returned to the French authorities when they were taken back. As for the prison rights of the First Special District Court and the Higher Second Branch of the Public Concession (civil case criminals and female prisoners) have already been taken back by our side, so they will also be taken back in the future. Other issues, such as the investigation power of the prosecutor, are also under consideration by the Ministry of Judicial Administration.</p>

<p>(Guowen News Agency) Liu Xiang, Commander of the 21st Army of the National Revolutionary Army, sent Wang Fangzhou, Commander of the Wang Column, leading Wang's own 3rd Division and Fan Shaozeng's (Shisheng) 4th Division, in mid-April this year, departing east from Linshui, Sichuan.</p>
<p>Aiding the 19th Route Army in Defending Against Japanese寇 Arriving in Yichang, upon hearing that the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement was about to be established, they were ordered to advance slowly. Later, due to the intense 赤焰 in western Hubei, they were ordered to jointly suppress the 赤匪 He Long, Duan Dazhang, etc. They advanced from Yichang to Shashi. Division Commander Fan Shaozeng braved the炮火, taking the lead, and was seriously injured on June 13 at the front line of Lao Xingzui in Shashi. He was immediately sent to Hankou Wanguo Hospital for surgery. Due to equipment issues, he telegraphed Shanghai Gongji Hospital Western doctor O'Harley and Chinese doctor Liu Songshi</p>
<p>The two doctors took a plane to Hankou on July 16 for consultation, and then accompanied Division Commander Fan on the Wuxue轮船, heading east from Hankou and arriving in Shanghai on the 22nd of the month for hospitalization. It was found that Division Commander Fan's injury was most severe in his right arm. Although the broken bone was reconnected and the bullet was also removed, fragments remained. Both his left and right thighs were also injured. Some of the bullets had been removed, and one bullet remained unextracted. However, according to the doctor's diagnosis, it was believed that the bullet in his medical area did not need to be removed and would not cause any health problems in the future.

<h3 id="e124">Yu Qiaqing Publishes a Talk on Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan has received close attention from all sectors. The reporter, considering that Mr. Yu Qiaqing has been in Shanghai for fifty years and is the祭酒 of Shanghai's commerce, specially went to ask for his opinion on this issue. He was pleased to publish the following remarks. Mr. Yu said that the harm of using both taels and yuan and the benefits of abolishing taels and changing to yuan are already known to everyone and do not need to be repeated. I dare to say that all industries in Shanghai will definitely not oppose this move or harbor secret dissent. However, in everything under heaven, there are benefits and harms. People today only know the benefits of abolishing taels and changing to yuan, but they do not consider how to study and eliminate the harms that will arise after abolishing taels and changing to yuan in advance. This is a big mistake. Although the names of silver taels in various places are complex, the value is consistently calculated based on the actual weight throughout the country. Silver yuan, on the other hand, are not. There are dozens of kinds, including British 洋, 本洋, 站人洋, 北洋龙洋, Yuan coins, and Premier coins. This only refers to hard currency. As for paper money, there are countless kinds throughout the country, making it difficult to enumerate them all. If we do not first comprehensively reorganize and start with a thorough reform, but blindly engage in it, how can we achieve results? For example, if a house leaks, someone proposes to replace it with a new one. This is something everyone agrees with, but before moving into the new house, we must study whether the new house is suitable and whether it has any shortcomings. If we rashly demolish the old house and move into the new house, if the new house leaks even worse, or if the sanitation is unsuitable or the architecture is incompatible, wouldn't we be in a dilemma and force the family to spend the night in the open air? Also, we know that to build a mansion, we must first consolidate the foundation. Rectifying hard currency is consolidating the foundation. Therefore, I advocate that before implementing the abolition of taels and changing to yuan, we must first have sufficient arrangements and preparations and must not implement it hastily. In short, the principle of abolishing taels and changing to yuan is absolutely indisputable, but water can help people and also drown them. It depends on the authorities' ability to use it well.</p>

<p>Organizers Exchanged Views Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>A Formal Establishment Will Be Decided Within a Short Time</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance prepares to implement the abolition of taels and changing to yuan, leaders of various industries in this city, in order to study the social economy, initiated the organization of an Economic Discussion Group.</p>
<p>Exchanging Views Yesterday morning at 12:00 noon, industry leaders Yu Qiaqing, Yu Zuoting, Chen Songyuan, Ping Bingfu, Wu Yaqin, Qin Xieqing, Hu Xihan, Fang Juchuan, Miao Zhenjin, and more than 20 other organizers held an informal meeting while having lunch at the Sanbei Company Building on Guangdong Road to exchange views on the organization of the Economic Discussion Group. As for the organizational outline, it has already been drafted and is being actively reviewed by those designated to review it. After the organizers' meeting is held within this week, it will be formally established.</p>
<p>Actively Preparing After the meeting, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency specially visited industry leaders. According to them, merchants unanimously agree with the principle of abolishing taels and changing to yuan, but after its implementation, the need for paper money will inevitably increase sharply. In order to prevent the excessive issuance of paper money, there should be concrete remedial measures. Now, in order to study the social economy and the advantages and disadvantages of the abolition of taels and changing to yuan, after exchanging views, it was considered that the organization of the Economic Discussion Group is really urgent, so it was decided to formally establish it in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Philie Lace Industry Appeals for Exemption from Business Tax <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Sends a Letter to the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association for Assistance</p>
<p>The Philie Lace Industry has repeatedly applied to the Ministry for exemption from business tax based on the principles and methods for reducing and exempting business tax decided by the 47th National Affairs Conference, but it has not been approved. Now, in accordance with the Court's decree, it is appealing to the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association for assistance. The letter says: "We respectfully inform you that Philie lace is a special product of Chuansha and Nanhui in Pudong. It is purely a handicraft industry of poor rural women. Its exquisite products are praised all over the world and are sold from Shanghai to Europe and the United States. Before ten years ago, the output increased year by year. At its peak, the total value reached about 3 million yuan. In the past ten years, due to the manipulation and control of foreign merchants, business has gradually declined. The total value of current sales is only about 1 million yuan. During the former Beijing government, it was approved to exempt from customs export tax and domestic goods tax, so the cost was not increased, and it was barely maintained, providing a livelihood for hundreds of thousands of poor people in Pudong. Unexpectedly, after the implementation of tax cuts, the government changed to collect business tax to compensate. According to the business tax regulations of Jiangsu Province, the lace industry is taxed at 20 per mille of the business turnover. Later, it was reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval to reduce it to 5 per mille. The Provincial Government ordered the county to comply. Under the order of our association, Shanghai lace is taxed because it is a combined business with a wide business scope and large sales volume, and it has been approved to exempt from business tax. Philie lace, on the other hand, is coarser than lace embroidery and has a narrower business scope, but it is taxed at a high rate of business tax, which is contrary to the principle of fair taxation. Therefore, we immediately referred to the Shanghai tax exemption precedent and reported to the Chuansha County Government for forwarding for tax exemption. We were then instructed by the county magistrate to forward the instructions from the Provincial Finance Office, stating that it was not appropriate to refer to the special circumstances of Shanghai and ordered strict enforcement and diligent collection. Our association immediately convened a temporary general meeting of members and resolved to reapply, according to the law and based on the facts, listing six reasons for tax exemption. We also checked the fourth item of the principles and methods for reducing and exempting business tax promulgated by the Executive Yuan in December last year decided by the 47th National Affairs Conference, which states that for domestic native products and handicrafts related to the livelihoods of the poor, which need to be promoted and maintained under special circumstances in international trade, the manufacturing industry or sales industry may be appropriately reduced or exempted from business tax by the central government or the provincial and municipal governments. We prepared a memorial and recommended Zhang Yunzhi, Du Yunxiang, and Tao Yumen as representatives to go to the capital to petition the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for exemption. Both department chiefs received them and believed that the reasons for requesting tax exemption were sufficient and in line with the fourth item of the principles and methods for reducing and exempting business tax promulgated by the 47th National Affairs Conference. Later, we requested the province to review and reply. Unexpectedly, after nearly a month, we received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that the four methods for reducing and exempting business tax ordered by the Executive Yuan were somewhat obstructive to the situation in this province and had been reported for approval and compliance, and ordered to be informed. Our association immediately continued to argue on the basis of the previous case. It happened that the Shanghai war broke out suddenly, and this case was shelved without recovery. Unexpectedly, we recently received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, according to the reply from the Finance Office, which stated that the situation of lace is completely different from that of homespun cloth. Homespun cloth is supplied and demanded by the poor, and tax exemption is still reasonable. Lace, on the other hand, is close to luxury goods and has nothing to do with the livelihoods of the poor, so there is no need for tax exemption. We were ordered to fill in the report and pay taxes within a limited time. After receiving the order, our association believed that the reply from the Finance Office was not only ignorant of the actual situation of Philie lace but also completely ignored the provisions of the fourth item of the principles and methods for reducing and exempting business tax decided and promulgated by the 47th National Affairs Conference, which states that native products and handicrafts related to the livelihoods of the poor, which need to be promoted and maintained under special circumstances in international trade, may be appropriately reduced or exempted from tax. We again recounted the actual situation of Philie lace manufacturing and the gradual reduction of exports, based on the 47th National Affairs Conference and the Shanghai tax exemption precedent, and continued to separately petition, stating at the end of the memorial that this case is a purely legal request made by merchants based on government orders and precedents. No matter how strictly the tax authorities force the collection, merchants will ultimately be unable to bear this deformed burden that violates the tax exemption precedent and is close to being biased. We have exhausted our voices, and it is still unknown whether we can invite the provincial government authorities to show special pity and approve our request. However, our association believes that the decline of Philie lace has reached an extreme degree, and exports are gradually shrinking. If we are taxed at 5 per mille of the business turnover, the cost will increase, and it will be even more difficult to maintain business. Most of those who operate this industry are short of capital, so how can they survive, and hundreds of thousands of poor women in our Pudong, on whom they depend for a living, will also be desperate. The importance of the relationship is not falsely stated. Because we believe that your association is a Pudong fellow townsmen group with deep qualifications and prestige, and especially values the suffering of merchants, we are specially recounting the case and copying all the previous memorials and instructions to inform you. We hope that you will examine the matter and grant us your strong support so as to achieve the goal of tax exemption and benefit our industry. To the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association."</p>

<p>(Central News Agency) A large number of communists gathered in the Gonghe Cinema on Xiaoshadu Road a few days ago. They were arrested by the Sixth District Public Security Bureau and transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation. The director, Wen Yingxing, considered the matter to be related to reaction and transferred the 88 suspects to the Songhu Garrison Command for interrogation. In the past, the authorities had an organization for reactionary cases, the Shanghai Temporary Military Law Joint Trial Office, with Chen Hanzu, Luo Jingyou, Jiang Huaisu, and Huang Daolin as five members. Since the January 28 Incident, the Joint Trial Office has been suspended in an intangible way. After receiving the case, the Songhu Garrison Command detained the suspects and investigated them separately. According to Chen Hanzu yesterday, the Joint Trial Office has notified the members and scheduled to interrogate them on the morning of the 28th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e132">The French Concession Public Works Bureau Levies a Business Tax on Solid Fuel <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations and Solutions Have Been Reached by the Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>Six Yuan Changed to Two Yuan</p>
<p>Implemented on July 1st</p>
<p>The French Concession Public Works Bureau has issued new regulations for the management of solid fuel warehouses and businesses, levying an annual business tax of six yuan, divided into two installments of three yuan each. The Coal Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which forwarded a letter to the French Concession Public Works Bureau, appealing for the revocation of the tax, but it was ineffective. The Bureau also sent personnel to implement the tax separately. Except for a few small coal and charcoal shops run by women who mistakenly paid the tax, all coal shops unanimously refused to pay and jointly signed a public petition to Director General Tranel, demanding that he withdraw the order and revoke the tax. It has been reported in previous reports that this case was handled by Zhang Gengshan (Manager of Jin Shun Sen Shun Jin Shun San Coal Shops), Chairman of the United Association of Merchants on the 12th Road of the New West District of the French Concession, who stated that the tax was really difficult for the industry to bear and requested assistance from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession. The Taxpayers' Association convened a meeting to discuss and decided to recommend Shang Mujian and Cheng Zhusun as representatives to repeatedly visit Director General Tranel with Zhang Gengshan to negotiate. Director General Tranel ordered the tax collectors to stop collecting the tax and submitted the original case to the Board of Directors for reconsideration and discussion to reduce the burden on the coal shops. As a result, the business tax of the business was reduced by four yuan from the original six yuan per year to two yuan, and it was still divided into two installments for collection, and it was postponed to July 1st for implementation. However, the directors of the Public Works Bureau considered the situation of the warehouse business tax to be special and still followed the original proposal. Director General Tranel informed the Taxpayers' Association of the reduction and postponement in a letter. The Taxpayers' Association immediately replied to Zhang Gengshan, and Zhang Gengshan separately informed the coal shops in the Concession. It is said that the coal shops have also understood and expressed their willingness to pay the tax and thanked Zhang Gengshan for his enthusiasm and Shang Mujian and Cheng Zhusun for their willingness to help. Therefore, the case has now been resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Zhabei Defense Corps Has Been Restored to Its Original State <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Zhabei District Defense Corps has been handling matters quite successfully. Unfortunately, it suffered great losses after the January 28 Incident. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency met with Wang Binyan, the head of the Zhabei Defense Corps, yesterday, who said that it has been gradually restored and that the police affairs in Zhabei will be even more consolidated in the future. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Original Situation: The Zhabei Defense Corps originally had eight squadrons, each with 108 people led by a captain. Including the affiliated teams, there were more than a thousand people. They were diligently trained on weekdays, and their firearms and clothing were also complete. They were the佼佼者 of the Defense Corps in various districts under the jurisdiction of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Post-War Losses: After the Shanghai War, the third and fifth teams of the Corps suffered considerable losses because the residences of the团丁 of the three teams were mostly in areas where the war was fierce. Because their residences were destroyed, their firearms and clothing were lost. The other teams also suffered losses.</p>
<p>Active Replenishment: After the Japanese troops withdrew from Zhabei, our side immediately took over, and our side's security围 immediately registered. If there were any incomplete ones, they were replenished. Now that the rectification has been completed, the original state has been restored and the guards are on duty as usual, but they have not yet been ordered to start drilling.</p>

<p>Since the Zhabei Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company suffered heavy losses from the war and after the armistice, in order to facilitate transportation, it immediately restored transportation in the areas where the Japanese troops had withdrawn at the expense of cutting costs to benefit the people. The number of passengers on the North Station to Zhenru line is very small. Although it is a loss, the vehicles come and go every day as usual. It is calculated that the last bus was scheduled to stop at 6:00 p.m. two months ago. Now, at the request of the residents of Shunzhenru, the company will operate the bus for one more hour every day from July 23. It is learned that the company has newly set the last bus time as follows:</p>

<p>The First Epidemic Hospital of the Zhabei Red Cross has a very large number of patients this week, crowded day and night. There are 108 cases of cholera, 362 cases of epidemic prevention, and 1,674 outpatients. There are no empty beds in any of the wards. Wu Guirong, Jiang Xiqing, Zhou Hongzhang, Zhang Danqing, Geng Guoxiang, Zhang Zidao, Qin Ruiting, and others held onto Wang Peiyuan, the director general, yesterday and requested that he immediately find a way to increase the number of wards. Chen Jingfang and Ji Yingjing, with the consent of Qin Ruiting, the兼护长, hired six additional female nurses, Feng Shouwei, Lu Yunru, Zheng Lijuan, and others, to be assigned. The president specially hired Wang Yaoguo and other four people as doctors. Wang Zhenchuan and Ma Xiaozhi, the two directors, are striving for hygienic progress due to the hot weather and the large number of people. All matters have been completed. Yesterday (23rd), President Du of the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce, accompanied by Director General Wang, visited the hospital. After Ji Rangzhi and Wu Zongyi requested guidance, he replied in English that he was satisfied with the hospital and could be regarded as the crown of the sea. At the same time, the toxin of Japanese violence, now seeing the plight of the patients, makes people痛定思痛.</p>

<p>(Dagong News Agency) The Zhongshan warship, which was bombed in Guangdong, sailed to Shanghai late the day before yesterday and immediately went to the Jiangnan Shipyard to enter the dry dock for repairs. It is said that the hull of the warship was severely damaged and will take two months to repair. Chen Di, Commander of the First Fleet of the Zhongshan warship, has shown his firm determination to resign and went to Beijing yesterday to report everything to the Ministry of the Navy.</p>

<p>Zhao Shusheng and Lao Jieming, representatives of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Association, sent a letter to Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, yesterday, saying, "We respectfully acknowledge that during the recent movement by postal workers across the country to consolidate the postal base, we did not receive the understanding of the authorities, which led to a strike. Fortunately, you, Minister, resolutely attended as a representative and upheld justice. Together with Shanghai Mayor Wu and leaders from all walks of life, you were responsible for mediating and accepted in principle the specific plan to consolidate the postal base proposed by the Trade Union, etc., and signed a solution. Our postal workers obtained a glimmer of light in the arduous struggle to maintain the post office. We are all grateful and admire your fairness, wisdom, and resolute responsibility. Now, the Postal Economic System Committee was established on June 24 as agreed and has convened formal meetings three times. However, we have not seen you, Minister, attend and participate in the meetings, and the gentlemen attending the meetings seem unable to make a decisive decision, resulting in repeated meetings without success. If this continues, the meetings will not be concluded soon, and the postal base plan will be indefinitely delayed. Judging from the original intention of mediation, it is unexpected, and it is felt that the Research Committee must have your, Minister, attendance and participation to be successful. We all believe that since you, Minister, have been responsible for mediation in the past, you will surely be able to handle it well in the future. We hope that you, Minister, will attend the meetings as soon as possible and strongly preside over them to satisfy the expectations of postal workers across the country and plan for the foundation of the entire post office. I am overwhelmed with anticipation."</p>

<p>Formal Inauguration Expected Next Month</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report indicates that China National Aviation Corporation's original routes between Shanghai and Hankou, Hankou and Chongqing, and Peiping and Shanghai included thriving service on the Shanghai-Hankou and Hankou-Chongqing lines last year. However, the Peiping-Shanghai route, running parallel to the Jinpu Railway, failed to gain traction and was soon suspended. According to Wu Zhaoxuan, the company's secretary, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, the company is now actively preparing the Shanghai-Tianjin route. Originally planned for seaplanes, the high salinity of the seawater in that area would damage the aircraft. Therefore, land-based aircraft will be used instead. The route will run from Shanghai, through Haizhou and Qingdao, to Tianjin, a total distance of 664 nautical miles. The flight from Shanghai to Tianjin will take seven hours. Airfields in Haizhou and Tianjin are already fully prepared. However, because the airfield in Qingdao has been leased to the Japanese, Liu Peiquan, the company's manager, along with Aviation Director Band, and Deputy Director Nie Kaiyi, etc., are scheduled to fly to Qingdao tomorrow (i.e., today) to negotiate. A resolution is expected, and passenger service should formally begin next month.</p>

<p>Workers at the Shanghai Electric Company, enraged by the factory's dismissal of 121 workers on the first of last month and the violation of the terms agreed upon during the sale by the former Municipal Council, appointed representatives to negotiate repeatedly without success. In an effort to unite and resist effectively, the entire workforce of over 2,500 workers has been actively organizing a labor union. Preparations are now complete, and the inaugural meeting was held yesterday at 2:00 PM in the auditorium of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.

<p>The meeting was attended by workers from both the old and new factories, Li Yongxiang and Li Mengnan from the General Labor Union, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Liu Xinquan, Shao Xubai, Zhu Xizhang, Zhang Zizhi from various labor unions, and staff representative Fang Qian, totaling over 2,000 people. A five-member presidium (names temporarily withheld) was elected by public nomination. The chairman began by reporting that the workers were enraged by the employer's unwarranted dismissal of a large number of workers, and repeated demands for reinstatement were ignored. Now that the union's organization is complete, this inaugural meeting is being held to discuss countermeasures. This was followed by speeches from Li Yongxiang and Li Mengnan of the General Labor Union and representatives of various other unions (details omitted). Finally, union directors and supervisors were elected, and six important resolutions were passed.</p>
<p>Resolutions Passed: (1) Demand that the employer recognize the union's right to represent all workers. (2) Demand that the employer not dismiss workers without cause. (3) Workers who retire must be paid a retirement bonus of six months' salary and a pension equal to 5% of their full salary. (4) Demand that the employer provide a monthly subsidy of 500 yuan for union activities. (5) Each worker will initially contribute half a day's salary to the union's basic fund, and a fund management committee will be established. (6) Workers who are unjustly injured by foreigners demand compensation for medical expenses and assurance that similar incidents will not recur.</p>

<p>The stretch of the Yangtze River downstream from Shanghai to Huajiaqiao in Yangzhou, known as the Tongyang Line (colloquially called the "Little Yangtze"), covers approximately 600 nautical miles and has 23 ports, more than the main Yangtze River. Consequently, business there is no less prosperous than on the main Yangtze. The route was originally served by the Dada and Datong companies, whose operations were thriving. Every year in late summer and early autumn, the Jiangbei area produces a large quantity of miscellaneous grains, and the scheduled sailings were insufficient to meet demand. Therefore, the two companies would add direct service ships to carry cargo at that time. Now, Meng Zhaoyue and his younger brother Zhuoran have initiated the organization of the Yongfeng Shipping Company to join the Tongyang Line. Preparations have been underway for four months, and the company began operations last Saturday. The company originally planned to operate three vessels. It has now purchased one vessel, named Yongchang, with a total tonnage of over 500 tons and a passenger capacity of over 300. It is docked at Pier No. 8 in Nanshi and departs from Shanghai every Wednesday and Saturday. Zhuoran has been appointed the manager of the company, and Chen Fangru has been appointed the business director.</p>

In addition, the Jiuduan lightship, which is located in the waters within Chuansha, has been replaced by a lightship temporarily dispatched by the Customs to benefit shipping merchants, although a new lightship has not yet been sent.</p>
<p>Steamship Bureau Collects Water Fees in Cash: Since the war, all industries in Shanghai have been impacted. The losses incurred by import and export customs brokers have also been significant. Jardine Matheson's Chongqing branch has temporarily suspended operations, and a certain Shandong-based customs broker recently went bankrupt, incurring losses of over 100,000 yuan, with various steamship companies having outstanding water fees. Yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the British firm Jardine Matheson decided that, starting on the 25th of this month, all export goods declared by customs brokers must be paid for in cash and no longer on credit.</p>

<p>The City National Arts Center held a grand banquet at the Central Western Restaurant the evening before last (the 23rd) to welcome Director Wu Tiecheng and to solicit members for the fifth term. Present were Director Wu's representative Yin Rugeng, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yansong, and about 60 other people. Yuan Ludeng, the deputy director of the center, delivered a speech. This was followed by a report from Director Zhang Fucheng on the center's founding in 1928, the disruption caused by the January 28th Incident, the current reorganization, and plans for future work. Yin's representative then gave a reply, and Lin Kanghou and Wang Yansong gave speeches as well. The gist of their remarks was that China's national strength is weak, and foreign aggression is rampant. The biggest reason for this is the lack of physical well-being among the people. If we want to talk about saving the country in the future, we must first strengthen ourselves. The most effective way to strengthen oneself is to practice national arts. National arts are invented and cultivated by our Chinese nation thousands of years ago and are beneficial to the body in ways that other forms of exercise cannot match. After the speeches, the banquet began. Subsequently, instructors of the center, Tong Zhongyi, Wu Jianquan, Ma Yueliang, and others performed various techniques to add to the occasion. The sword lights flashed, and the cold air was chilling. The gathering finally ended in joy.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Minhang Bus Company Adds Special Buses Minhang Town, located southwest of the city, is more than 80 li from Shanghai. The town is a prosperous commercial center bordering the Huangpu River. In the past, the local magnate, Mr. Li Yingshi, raised large sums of money to purchase land and build the Shanghai-Minhang Motor Road, facilitating transportation. He also built Min Garden north of the town, with artificial hills and flowers, which were of particular interest. Amusement facilities were set up inside, and during the summer months, Chinese and foreign people from Shanghai would flock there during their leisure time. Last summer, the town opened the Riverside Garden on the bank of the Huangpu River at the southern end of the Shanghai-Minhang Road. The garden had a tennis court, swimming pool, Western restaurant, etc., and was extremely popular with tourists. Since the cessation of the Shanghai War, many people from Shanghai have been taking buses to Minhang for sightseeing. Therefore, a large Shanghai merchant is now rebuilding the former site of the Riverside Garden into a summer resort garden. Construction began several months ago and is now nearing completion. The garden has a beautiful location and stunning scenery, with clean air that is beneficial to health. The prospect of successful business is assured. It is also learned that the Shanghai-Minhang Bus Company is preparing to add special buses, which are scheduled to begin running next week or at the opening.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Aftermath of the Factional Fighting Near the Second District <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Li Xinzai Accuses the Second District of Unjust Punishment</p>
<p>Mediation Is Underway, and Peaceful Resolution Is Expected</p>
<p>A few days ago, a crowd fight involving more than 100 Shanghai hoodlums took place at the Changle Tea House, located just a stone's throw away from the Second District Police Station in Nanshi. Each side carried a large number of axes and iron rulers, and the fighting was intense, with many people seriously injured. At the time, the area around Wansheng Bridge was on the verge of chaos, and traffic was completely blocked. When the Second District police finally arrived, they only intercepted a small number of people, including Li Xinzai, and seized several axes. At the time, District Chief Zhang Dongkai, in addition to sending the injured to the hospital, immediately interrogated Li Xinzai. According to Li, he worked as a ticket seller for the French tram company, and he explained the cause of the altercation. District Chief Zhang, in a fit of rage, believed that Li and others dared to incite a crowd and carry weapons in broad daylight, within earshot of the police station, and that they would be responsible if anyone died as a result. Therefore, he had Li severely beaten before handing him over to the District Court. That evening, the court temporarily released Li on bail pending trial. It is now reported that the case has ended. However, Li Xinzai feels aggrieved that the Second District Police Station should not have used unjust punishment. He intends to hire lawyer Xu Heling to file a lawsuit in the District Court against District Chief Zhang. It is now reported that District Chief Zhang, in order to settle the matter, has had someone named Zhang come forward to mediate, agreeing to compensate Li for the medical expenses incurred as a result of the injuries sustained from the beating, and to express his apologies. It is reported that Li is satisfied and has agreed to a peaceful resolution.</p>

Therefore, he submitted a report to Director Wen, prepared official documents, and Inspector Zhou led detectives Gao Wansheng to Hankou on the Jiangxin Steamer yesterday to transfer Lin to Shanghai for interrogation and trial.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau, lacking funds for the county's Party affairs expenses for the 21st year, proposed levying one yuan per hundred yuan on the sale of land and property deeds and half a yuan per hundred yuan on pawn deeds.

The Provincial Department of Finance issued a directive approving the county's levy of one yuan per hundred yuan on the sale of deeds, but exempting the levy on pawn deeds. The bureau has issued an order to the Deed Tax Office to comply with the instructions.</p>

<p>The Eighth District Cotton Spinning Industry Union Issues a Statement Last year, a labor dispute occurred at the Yong An Factory in Wusong over the issue of bonuses, which remains unresolved. Eleven arrested union directors, including Shen Yongming, were acquitted by the Shanghai District Court on the 13th of this month. Because Prosecutor Yang Qi did not accept the verdict and filed an appeal, Shen Fugen, Shen Yongming, and the other eight workers remained in custody, except for Zhang Zhenquan and the other three, who were released on bail. Unexpectedly, Shen Fugen suddenly died in prison at midnight on the 19th of this month. The Eighth District Cotton Spinning Industry Union stated that because the workers had been acquitted, Prosecutor Yang refused to grant bail, leading to Shen Fugen's death in prison. Therefore, it issued a statement (excerpt) requesting that all sectors uphold justice.</p>

The bandits dared to open fire and resisted arrest, fighting as they fled. Because the moon had not yet risen, the bandits escaped in the darkness.

They were introduced from Shaoxing to work at a Shanghai yarn factory and reside at their home. Unexpectedly, Guo Yingen, Liu Jinxian's cousin, enticed the four girls to run away with him the day before yesterday. Concerned for their responsibility, Zhou and his sister immediately asked someone to watch the train and boat stations. They discovered Liu Jinxian on the Ningbo-Shaoxing steamer and brought her home. Upon questioning her, they learned that Guo Xigen had hidden the other three girls separately. He ordered Liu Jinxian and others to travel together on the boat.

<p>Shen Dingnian, age 55, from Chongming, was introduced by his fellow villager Lu Ziming to work for a Mr. Shen at Caojia Muqiao in Wusong one year ago. It was agreed that his salary would be 5 yuan per month. After one year and one month, a total of 65 yuan had not been paid. During the January 28th Incident, the residents of Wusong fled, and Shen also returned to his hometown to take refuge. After the Japanese army withdrew and Wusong gradually returned to normal, Shen sent his younger brother and son, Haiqiao, to Mr. Shen's house to demand his wages. However, Mr. Shen intended to renege on the debt and falsely claimed that Shen Ding had already settled his wages when he left. He gathered a crowd and beat the two men, who fled back to their hometown and told Shen Ding everything. Shen was shocked to hear this. A few days ago, he bought a table and came to Shanghai, staying at his fellow villager's house. Yesterday morning, he went to Mr. Shen's house alone to demand his wages but was humiliated and falsely accused of lacking several pieces of furniture, which he was ordered to compensate for. As a result, he left in displeasure without receiving any money. After Shen Ding left Mr. Shen's house, he felt infinite anger. He walked to Songzhen, bought opium paste, secretly ingested it, and then went to his introducer, Lu Ziming, and explained everything. After a while, Lu noticed that his face was pale and his spirits were low. Upon questioning him strictly, Shen told him everything, finally admitting that he had committed suicide by taking poison. Lu hired a car and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at 5:20 PM.</p>

<p>Wu Caifa, a resident of Ningbo residing at No. 195 and a Half Guirenyi, North Fujian Road, lost his seven-year-old daughter, Deyi, on May 15 while she was playing in front of the door. He asked people to search for her everywhere, but to no avail. On the 12th of this month, Hongkou Police Station detectives Yang Zhaoqing and Xie Guisheng learned that Wang Asi, an abductor they had previously arrested, had confessed that Wu's daughter had been sold to a certain family in Shouguang County, Qingzhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, to be raised as an adopted daughter. They reported this to the police chief and obtained a public notice from the First Special District Court. They traveled by boat with the girl's father, Wu Caifa, to the area. By chance, Wu Deyi was walking on the street when she saw her father and became overjoyed. They inquired about the residence of the seller, and the detectives entered the house, informed them of the situation, and presented the official letter. They took the girl back and reported the matter to the court in charge. Yesterday morning, they returned to Shanghai and sent the girl to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, described what had happened and said that Wu's daughter had been sold by Wang Asi's friend to that place for 60 yuan. Subsequently, Wu Caifa, the girl's father, gave a report. The girl, Deyi, said that an unknown man had said he would buy her candy and took her to a certain place. She could not provide more details. She smiled happily and pointed to Wu Caifa as her father. Judge Shen Bingrong told the girl, Deyi, to return to her father, Wu Caifa, and reunite with her family.</p>

<p>The young woman, Chen Lushi, age 24, from Tianjin, was beautiful. Her husband, Chen Zhiwei, age 22, used to work at a foreign firm but is now unemployed. They had been married for over a year and lived together at No. 17 Qingyuli, South Chengdu Road. They were quite well-off. At 10:30 AM the day before yesterday, Chen hanged herself alone in her bedroom with a silk ribbon suspended from the bed. Chen Su Shi (the husband's grandmother, age 76), saw her and called Chen Zhiwei to help her down. However, she was already barely breathing and could not be saved. Chen Zhiwei and others reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station, who ordered detective Ye Yushan to investigate. The deceased was sent to Renji Hospital and then to the Forensic Pathology Laboratory on Feilun Road for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District District Court, along with bailiff Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the laboratory to examine the body. According to the statement given by the husband, Chen Zhiwei, "We have always been on good terms. My wife cut her hair two weeks ago, but my father-in-law is from a traditional family and works on a boat. My wife was afraid that her father would quarrel with her if he saw it, so she…" The brother of the deceased, Chen Jin, age 22, who resides at No. 54 Yuanjili, Tangshan Road, and is currently a student, said, "My sister and brother-in-law have always been on very good terms. This time, she really committed suicide because of the haircut."

<p>Zhang Songlin from Ningbo is currently twenty-one years old. He was working as a houseboy at the residence of a foreigner at No. 114, Lane 7, Nanyang Road. Earlier this month, the foreigner also hired a Suzhou woman named Xue A’e as an "amah" (nursemaid). Zhang, seeing that Xue possessed some beauty, immediately attempted to seduce her. However, Xue was only seventeen, her affections just opening. After Zhang’s enticements, she couldn’t help but feel a flutter in her heart. Just as their passion was reaching a fever pitch, Zhang was suddenly dismissed by his master. Unwilling to give up the meat that was already at his mouth, he secretly snuck into Xue’s bedroom the following night (the thirteenth of last month) to fulfill his amorous dreams. After that, Zhang continued to visit her secretly for romantic encounters, about seven or eight times in total. However, he eventually felt that this furtive, secret behavior was inconvenient. Therefore, around 9 PM on the thirteenth of this month, he went to Xue again and told her, "The wages here are too low. I've already recommended you for a job at a foreigner's house at No. 2 Tangshan Road. The wages are much better there, so go quickly." Xue, unaware of his deception, followed him out. She was then taken to the building of the Yangshupu Electric Company to stay overnight at the home of his mother, Zhang Huangshi. The next day, they rented a house at No. 429, Siwen Lane, Dalian Bay Road, and began living together. However, Xue Fengshi, Xue’s mother, thought that A’e, having just arrived in Shanghai, had gone out shopping and lost her way home after her daughter disappeared. She reported it to the police station, saying that her daughter was lost. It wasn't until the afternoon of the day before yesterday that she discovered that her daughter had actually been seduced and abducted by Zhang Songlin. She then reported it to the police station, which dispatched Detective Fan Defu and Patrolman Hu Zhiyun. They first arrested Zhang's mother, Huangshi, and then, guided by her, went to Siwen Lane and arrested Zhang Songlin, rescuing Xue A’e at the same time. They were all taken back to the Jing’an Temple Police Station. Xue was ordered to be sent to the Red Cross Hospital to verify that her hymen had been ruptured. Consequently, Zhang and his mother were taken into custody separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. According to the police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, he recounted the previous events and said that the two defendants were being prosecuted for violating Article 257, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime of disrupting a family. Then, according to the victim, Xue A’e, she complained that Zhang had used the pretext of recommending a job to have sexual relations with her several times. Furthermore, according to Xue Fengshi, her daughter A’e was seventeen years old, born in the eighth month of the lunar calendar. She had been betrothed to someone in her hometown of Suzhou before coming to Shanghai. Now that she had been violated by the defendant, she demanded an investigation. Zhang Songlin and Zhang Huangshi stammered in their confessions. After Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confessions in court, he sentenced Zhang Songlin to one year of imprisonment for intending to commit sexual intercourse with a woman under the age of twenty and inducing her to leave the control of a person with parental rights. Zhang Huangshi was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for aiding and abetting the harboring of the induced person, both sentences suspended for three years. Xue A’e was released to her mother.</p>

<p>The twelve detained soldiers arrived at Xiashi Station yesterday at around 11:00 AM on the 36th slow train from Shanghai to Hangzhou. There were more than twenty wounded soldiers from the 88th Division in the third-class carriage. Because they were traveling without tickets, a conflict arose with the military police escorting the train. The wounded soldiers immediately used teacups and utensils from the carriage to hurl at the heads of the military police. Because they were outnumbered, the military police were struck on the head, and blood flowed freely. At that time, the 31st express train from Hangzhou to Shanghai arrived at Xiashi Station. The stationmaster immediately ordered the train to stop and boarded the carriage to report to the military police escort and requested assistance in suppressing the unrest. The wounded soldiers were still committing violence, so they surrounded the wounded soldiers and fired shots as a warning, capturing twelve of the troublemaking soldiers on the spot. They were escorted back to Hangzhou for questioning on the original train. When the military police fired, the passengers on both trains got off the train and fled. Fortunately, the situation was resolved quickly, and no passengers were injured, but they were quite frightened.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Opening of the Paris Open-Air Cinema <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The film industry in this city inevitably suffers a decline during the summer months. The reason for this is that most people in the industry are unaccustomed to sitting in dark and airless movie theaters during the hot weather. Therefore, in recent years, some theaters have added air conditioning, while others have established open-air cinemas specifically for summer operations. Recently, an organization called the Paris Open-Air Cinema was established in the Paris Night Garden, across from the Zhaofeng Garden. The equipment and layout are very perfect, and a large sum of money was used to install a sound machine from the Western Electric Company of the United States, exclusively showing selected Chinese and foreign sound blockbusters. Last night was the first day of the opening, and the latest sensational Paramount blockbuster, "The Love Parade," directed by Ernst Lubitsch and starring Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, was specially screened. Admission was uniformly priced at one yuan, and the audience was extraordinarily crowded. The reason for this is that the venue is surrounded by flowers and trees, the air is fresh, and the oppressive heat does not reach it, making it a summer resort for Shanghai's dancers. The venue also has a reception area next to the Palace Grand Theater of the New World Hotel.

<p>Shen Shumei, the landlord of Daode Lane on Cadre Road, usually entrusts the foreign firm Peace &amp; Ming to collect rent for the lane. Recently, he issued notices using the pretext of rebuilding, ordering all residents to move out. The residents are extremely angry, all saying that the suffering of the market closure and unemployment after the January 28th Incident has not yet recovered, and the landlord's actions are too cruel. Moreover, the houses are still in good condition and do not need to be rebuilt. Therefore, they have elected nine representatives, including He, Zhang, Shao, and Su, and entrusted lawyer Yu Hualong to make demands to the landlord. If the demands are not met, hundreds of residents will be forced to sleep in front of the landlord's door and cry for help, regardless of the consequences.</p>

<p>Xiao Renyuan, the former director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, was sent by the central government to Europe and the United States three years ago to investigate railway operations. Xiao first went to Germany and studied at the University of Berlin. Afterwards, he went to various major railway companies in England, the United States, France, and Switzerland to intern. He has now started his journey back to China and has first written a large volume of "Records of German Railway Investigation." The content is extremely rich, detailing the latest German railway management, traffic, engineering, machinery, and accounting, chapter by chapter, collecting everything without omission. It contains more than one hundred tables and fifty exquisite diagrams. An appendix on world transportation provides a detailed overview of the transportation situation in various countries, which can serve as a compass for China's future railway development. It is said that the book has already been published and is being distributed by the Shanghai Life Weekly Society.</p>

<p>(6) Uncompensated transport: For example, if a plaintiff and his luggage are transported by the defendant without compensation, and the luggage is lost in transit, the plaintiff demands compensation. However, the court believes that the defendant should not be held liable as an insurer or common carrier. This argument is quite fair, because if someone providing transportation services without compensation were to bear the special responsibility of insurance, it would be too unfair. However, if a transportation service appears to be free on the surface but is actually charging indirectly, the responsibility of a common carrier cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>(7) Transportation without a fixed fee should not be considered uncompensated: A carrier cannot avoid the responsibility of an insurer simply because it did not explicitly charge a fee at the time of carriage, nor can it avoid this responsibility by waiving the fee after the loss has occurred. Allowing them to avoid this would allow carriers to take the opportunity to evade the responsibilities of a common carrier. (To be continued)</p>

<p>One thing is worth noting: the study of European and Asian cultures seems to have started simultaneously. When Western Greek philosophy began to flourish, with Plato and Aristotle lecturing one after another, China was in the late Three Dynasties, the Spring and Autumn period, and the Warring States period, leading to the Qin and Han dynasties. The writings of the philosophers were also extremely popular at that time. Although Emperor Qin Shi Huang burned books and buried scholars alive, he could not stop the transmission of the philosophers' doctrines. When Cicero became a prominent figure in Rome, Han dynasty essays also reached their peak. Rome unified Europe, and the Western Han dynasty almost unified Asia. During the Song dynasty, there was alchemy, and during the Middle Ages, alchemy and magic were also extremely popular in the West. From this fact of the mutual communication of Eastern and Western cultures, we can understand that human intelligence does not vary according to race.</p>
<p>The places where Eastern and Western cultures communicate are too numerous to mention! For example, Emperor Qin Shi Huang built the Great Wall and the Epang Palace, while Rome was also engaged in large-scale construction projects. The luxury of the Epang Palace, as described in the "Rhapsody on the Epang Palace," is vividly remembered, but unfortunately, it was burned down by Xiang Yu in a single fire, leaving posterity with no way to admire or mourn it. In fact, the value of Chinese culture is often squandered by the general public. Throughout history, most cultural constructions have suffered the calamity of burning and killing. Countries with long-standing cultures often have many people who love to burn and kill, and these people who love to burn and kill continue for generations, accumulating like alluvial deposits. How can even the slightest cultural accumulation withstand the burning and killing of generations?</p>
<p>Speaking of the Epang Palace, during the Xianfeng period, there was a British minister to China named Thomas Wade, who was inspired to do research on it. Wade's Chinese was very good, and he even wrote a Chinese textbook for the British to read. According to Wade's research, in the garden of the Epang Palace, there were boats made of mercury and ducks and geese made of gold and silver. The bridges were made of copper wire mesh, making them soft and comfortable to walk on. However, since the Epang Palace was burned down by the ruthless Xiang Yu, even if Wade described it in flowery terms, there is no real evidence to prove it.</p>

<p>— Renwu</p>
<p>The war of the twentieth century is purely scientific, that is, chemical. As for airplanes, twenty years ago they were only an ideal. The "Eastern Miscellany" exaggerated the claims about new airships. Unexpectedly, in the Battle of Zhabei this time, the Japanese relied on airplanes to drop bombs, turning the destroyed Zhabei into scorched earth. Doesn't China also have airplanes? In the Battle of Zhengzhou, they were quite effective. Knowing that Chinese airplanes were coming to Shanghai, the Japanese went to Suzhou to intercept them. In this aerial war, the American Short was killed, and Japanese soldiers were also killed and wounded. There was also a dawn battle over the Qiantang River. Thus, the war of airplanes will inevitably become a vanguard for the masters of the Pacific. Anti-aircraft guns are the opponents of airplanes. But there are people who said that the "Flying Thunder," invented by Cai Linsheng (is already successful, and has good results.) Others say that it is just propaganda. The Flying Thunder is just a "Flying Heaven Thunder," with a short range that cannot shoot down airplanes. If there really were Flying Thunder, why is there no record of it? Both statements have their reasons. I only hope that Cai Linsheng will continue to research and will surely succeed one day.</p>
<p>The types of poison gas manufactured by various countries total more than two hundred. The ones made in Czechoslovakia are particularly ingenious. Although Japan claimed that it had not used them in the Battle of Zhabei in Shanghai, the fact that the ones made in Czechoslovakia were bought by Japan is true. In the future, the use of poison gas is inevitable. The Chinese army should not worry about Japan's use of poison gas, but should worry that we cannot invent a powerful weapon to defend against poison gas. Dumdum bullets have already been proven in hospitals. Smoke bombs have already been seen in Yunzaobang and Liuhang. Light and heavy tanks are even speeding between Wusong and Jiangwan. Only the invention of the "death ray" has been rumored, but it has not yet been seen in battle. As for Japan's newly invented torpedoes, they will surely dominate the Pacific in the future. China</p>

<p>— Xuelang</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai, I often went back and forth to the battlefield as a reporter. Sometimes the front lines were quiet, and I would remember my friends in the trenches. We would sit knee-to-knee on the ground and talk about snippets of news from the war. Someone told me about seizing a gun. The story was very interesting. During the fierce battle at Baziqiao, our army counterattacked. An advance suicide squad of fourteen men, carrying bombs, rushed into the enemy's ranks. At that time, twenty enemies were guarding a machine gun. Seeing our army approaching, they retreated in a panic without firing a shot. Our army captured the machine gun without firing a single bullet and then used the gun to sweep the enemy. Not one of the enemies who had previously guarded the gun was spared. Using their own methods to treat their own bodies, that's what it's all about. Now that the situation in Rehe is urgent, I am writing this to encourage the brave soldiers who defend our country.</p>
<p>has only receiving and sending government officials, so torpedoes and submarines have to sigh that heroes have no place to use their skills.</p>
<p>The books that Chinese people have been pursuing recently are just a few broken books, and they are still bought from foreign countries. When it comes to scientific and physical chemistry books, the science departments of various universities have already gone down the wrong path. The government officials also do not pay attention to it. What I hope for from the major newspapers is to publish more articles about science, which may be of some small help?</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Middle School Student's Predicament <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>One day I met a relative who had just graduated from middle school.</p>
<p>I said, "Your three years of high school work have now come to an end. Congratulations."</p>
<p>He frowned and sighed. "Alas, what's there to congratulate? Now I'm going through a difficult time. I'm really disheartened."</p>
<p>I said, "What's making you so unhappy?" He shook his head and said, "When I hadn't graduated yet, I was always thinking about which university to apply to. I thought about going to Peiping. There are good schools there, but it's too far from home. The round-trip fare is really a lot. I thought about studying in Shanghai, but the cost of living is too expensive, and there are limited good schools. After thinking it over, I thought it would be best to apply to Zhongda, because I heard that the equipment inside is very good, and the fees are not high, and it's close to home. So I was always thinking about how to apply to Zhongda. Alas, brother, things are really making me too disheartened. I just received the admissions brochure, and the next day I saw in the newspaper that Zhongda had been dissolved. I was so anxious. I went to ask the teachers, and the teachers said, 'This is just a temporary phenomenon. It will definitely be restored soon.' They told me to prepare as usual. Alas, who knew that the restoration was not only unscheduled, but that they wouldn't even be recruiting this year. What do you think I should do?"</p>
<p>I said, "If they really don't recruit this year, then find something to do and take the exam next year. Isn't that the same?"</p>
<p>He said, "Alas, brother, you're wrong. Where do you think an ordinary middle school student like me can find a job? There are more and more unemployed people every day. People with my qualifications are really a dime a dozen. There's no place to put them. Where can I find a job? As for going to 'Family University,' not only would I be ashamed of being idle, but my youth would be gone, and there would be no opportunity to study in the future. We're really stuck between a rock and a hard place. Like a dumb person eating Coptis chinensis (Chineses goldthread), we can't express our suffering. Only we know it in our hearts. Sigh, it's not just me. There are so many middle school students who have the same plans as me. They're just as miserable as I am."</p>
<p>He was very indignant. He continued, "Sometimes I can't help but hate the government for being irresponsible. Usually, a bunch of bureaucratic politicians like to run education without even investigating it. Once something goes wrong, they just 'dissolve,' 'suspend,' 'seal,' or 'cancel' things, without considering the students' time and studies at all. You want to reorganize, then reorganize. It's easy to restore things in a short amount of time. Who knew it would turn out like this? Where is the government thinking about the students? Where are they treating education as education? If they really treated education as education, things wouldn't have gotten this bad."</p>
<h3 id="e178">Worth Introducing Domestic Goods Factories (9) <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>(Fifteen) Fountain Pen Factories</p>
<p>Fountain pens have always come from overseas, especially from Japan, because of their low prices and ability to sell well for a while. In the past four or five years, the Guan Leming Fountain Pen Factory and the Dachina Fountain Pen Factory in Shanghai, one on Kangtuo Road and one in Shencheng Lane on West Axham Road, have been opened by Chinese people.</p>
<p>When manufacturing fountain pens, first make the pen barrel. Most high-quality barrels are made of rubber and rosin. Take the barrel and measure its length, turn the inner and outer screws, and then assemble the upper and lower copper parts, install the water absorption belt, the nib, etc. The copper parts are mostly not self-made, but bought from copper parts makers. This kind of manufacturing by division of labor can reduce costs. As for the nibs, they are entirely foreign goods.</p>
<p>The working machines are small lathe beds, silver hole machines, vices, and several polishing machines. Lathe beds are needed more, so most use motor tows. It is convenient to hold various turning tools in one hand. The important work is also here. Because if the screws on the small pen barrel are not close, the ink will inevitably drip, which will be annoying. Each lathe bed can only produce two or three pens a day, because precise work cannot be done quickly. The market price is eight yuan for each expensive one and around four yuan for cheap ones. Guan Leming can produce one hundred pens per month, and Dachina is similar.</p>
<p>In fact, although the manufacturing process of fountain pens is complicated, in the home, you can start working with a lathe, a hand-cranked small drilling machine, and a small vise. If you produce twenty or thirty pens a month, you can get a family's livelihood.</p>
<p>(Sixteen) Ink Factories</p>
<p>There are six or seven ink manufacturers in Shanghai, including Guan Leming, Minsheng, Dahua, Zhongyi, Jincheng, and China Commercial.</p>
<p>In recent years, fountain pens have become popular among people in the education field, each with a pen, and the ink required for fountain pens has also sold widely. The best ink must be free of impurities, bright in color, and smooth in writing. There are two colors, red and blue, but blue ink is most widely used for pens. The market price of high-quality ink is about two yuan per dozen. The value of foreign goods is more expensive. Most of those who sell in China are overseas Chinese and foreign merchants. Chinese people mostly use domestic goods. Especially people in the education field.</p>
<p>Ink raw materials, such as gallnut color, etc., are mixed with water and refined one or two times to precipitate the impurities. Some add spices to make the smell fragrant, hoping to win the welcome of buyers. Although it is a small thing, the annual sales are also tens of thousands of dollars. Fortunately, manufacturers do not need much equipment and do not need labor. Thirty to fifty dollars can be used to manufacture it at home. The decoration is also extremely simple.</p>
<p>Most of the ink manufacturers also produce ink for writing brushes. The raw material is ink powder. At first, the manufacturers all used the pine soot ink powder from the old days in China. Later, they used the ink powder used for manufacturing printing ink for foreign goods, which was more suitable, and mostly changed to use it, because it has no impurities and the concentration is uniform. It is a pity that the cost is more expensive. All other manufacturing procedures are the same as ink.</p>
<p>Brief News: Recently, a well-known veteran of the art world has established a new literary and art club on Luban Road, specializing in the sale of ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings. He is now collecting hundreds of fan surfaces of calligraphy and paintings by famous modern figures from the north and south, and plans to open a fan surface exhibition within the month. Among them, there are many that are not easy to obtain, such as Mr. Qin Zizhi, who is eighty years old this year, and the fan surface he wrote is still full of energy. Sun Chengshimin, the grandson of the "ten-hair old man," is only twelve years old. His landscape paintings directly emulate the works of famous figures in the Three Dingjia. There are also many works by the top scholar Liu Runqin, who has long withdrawn the fee for his paintings, and cannot be sought except by those he knows. There are also many works by famous artists such as Ye Guangquan, Cheng Ten Hair, Kuang You, and Han. The beautiful and incomparable sights cannot be taken in all at once.</p>

<p>—斋夫 Who Does Not Weed the Courtyard</p>

<p>Mr. Zhu's argument is like quinine; the first taste is sweet, but as soon as you mistakenly bite down, you immediately taste the bitterness. He always adds one or two pieces of bitter melon under the candy, making it hard for you to swallow. For example, when he hears about the so-called six major trainings, the first five are undoubtedly good. Why add this reproductive training? (Good birth) is certainly something everyone agrees with. Who would want to give birth to bad children? (Giving birth to a dragon or a snake all depends on the old man in the sky.) Although this is a superstitious saying, it makes sense if you regard this old man in the sky as the old man of nature. Who can say for sure that he will give birth to good children and not bad children? From the ordinary point of view, the children of Emperor Yao should all be good, but why did he give birth to a degenerate Danzhu? On the other hand, it is not surprising that 瞽叟 gave birth to an arrogant Xiang, but why did he also give birth to a supremely filial and wise Shun? Can Mr. Zhu teach Yao not to give birth to Danzhu? Can he teach 瞽叟 not to give birth to Xiang but only to Shun? As for the three words (bear fewer), I understand them even less. Now that China is oppressed by imperialism, it should encourage reproduction and use the power of its large population to resist. How can it teach people to have fewer children to reduce national power? Moreover, Mr. Zhu often says that recruiting students is like Han Xin counting soldiers, the more the better, but now he wants to advocate reducing the population, which is really beyond my expectation. To be honest, I can't swallow this piece of bitter melon. I dare not blindly follow, but I don't want to criticize thoughtlessly. At the same time, I admit that Mr. Zhu is not just talking nonsense. He must have some facts as the basis for his argument. I want to examine the facts he is based on before criticizing his argument, and finally decide whether I agree with this argument. After I made up my mind, I said to Mr. Zhu: (I am very skeptical about your claim to reduce the population, and now I want to ask you to give me some factual evidence.) Mr. Zhu said: Your attitude is a fundamental attitude for scholars to do scholarship (bring evidence!) Academic theory must be based on evidence to be indestructible. However, I have further hope for you. Since you doubt my argument, you will inevitably doubt the facts I have collected. I hope you will take two steps as one, and collect facts on the population problem yourself, so that these facts will naturally elicit arguments. Don't have a trace of prejudice in your heart. When you filter out arguments from the facts, compare them with my facts and arguments to see whose is right. At that time, if mine is right, you will abandon your argument; if yours is right, I will definitely abandon my argument and follow you. If you have the opportunity to go to the city, you can go to the university library, the municipal library, and other libraries to browse the works on population issues, and then run to the source of facts in society to conduct detailed interviews yourself. This work is very interesting. You can do it at your leisure. Fortunately, my one-copper-coin birth control method has not yet been invented, and it is not too late to decide our policy after you have studied it.) Okay, let's do it that way.</p>

<p>Slight Rise of Two Taels and Eight Mace</p>
<p>Red Bar Balance Not Thin</p>
<p>The bidding gold situation last week, although there were no special changes, formed a pattern of circling. The situation was elusive, and the price turned upward day by day, at most seven or eight taels. The intentions of colleagues were uncertain, so the demand and supply were different. The price was often around 750 taels. In the end, it rose slightly. The opening price for September at the beginning of the week was 750 taels, and it tended to rise. The silver market had already reported a shrinkage. Today, news suddenly came that the United States would issue banknotes to maintain the economy, and it suddenly became weak. On Tuesday, it showed a profit, probably because the exchange market seemed tight. It once rose to 53 taels and 7 mace. Later, the exchange rate rose continuously. On Thursday, it fell to 42 taels and a half. After that, the rise and fall were irregular. Finally, foreign telegrams reported that the US President had approved the issuance of relief banknotes, and the trend turned soft. The high and low for the whole week was only 11 taels and 2 mace. The total nucleus was slightly higher than the previous week by 2 taels and 8 mace, and only increased by 6 mace compared to the first day of trading (opening price of 748 taels and a half). As for the British and American silver markets, they shrank after three consecutive weeks of growth. The local exchange market was still flat, only the bills of exchange shrank by half a level, and the internal balance was maintained. Only the US dollar shrank slightly, probably because the exchange rate had been shrinking for four weeks. So far, the British dollar is 625 higher against the US dollar, and the US dollar is 75 higher against the British dollar. (In the middle of this week, it rose and then fell. Chinese merchants and speculators and the gold industry, because of the different receipts and payments of bills of exchange, generally threw out US dollars and hedged back notes. Tens of thousands of yuan were traded every day, but the hedging price was slightly far apart. The near-term is calculated at over 40 taels, and the long-term is 37-38 taels. If calculated according to the listed price, it is about 70 taels. There are still more than 10,000 notes that have not been properly settled in August. Both the long and short sides have mutually traded, and the bulls are still paying in, only about 2 taels. Recently, the Central Bank has rarely absorbed spot goods, and the balance is not thin, so the notes are often increased by 9 taels, 2 mace, 5 fen to 9 taels, 7 mace, 5 fen. Now, the high and low prices of British and American silver and exchange rate bids for a week are listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market transactions were particularly deserted due to the bank's weekly holiday. The price of silver was slightly higher in the morning market than the previous day by half a li, at 6 qian 9 fen 2 li 2 hao and a half. The afternoon market continued to fall by 1 hao and 2 hu a half, at 6 qian 9 fen 2 li 1 hao 2 hu a half.

The volume of discount note transactions was 4.56 million in the morning market and 780,000 in the afternoon market. The exchange of bills of exchange was 160,000 in the morning market and 175,000 in the afternoon market. The money shops received and remitted more than 3.8 million in foreign public bills, more than 21 million in copper public bills, more than 400,000 in remittances from various routes, and more than 300,000 in transactions by small money shops. The price of Jiangnan small silver dollar was 6 qian and 03 li in both the morning and afternoon markets, and no transactions were made. The price of Guangdong small silver dollar was 5 qian 8 fen 8 li in the morning market and 5 qian 8 fen 8 li 7 hao and a half in the afternoon market. The volume of transactions was 75,000 jiao in the morning market and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins shrank slightly by 1,000 wen, to 426,000 wen. The volume of transactions was more than 41,700 strings of wen, with a total value of 9,800 taels of silver.</p>

<p>Market Conditions Improved and Transactions Reached More Than 28 Million</p>
<p>The market transaction situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange last week (from July 18 to 23), with few spot goods coming in and out, and even more desolate in the last few days of the week. It is estimated that only 41,000 yuan were opened for the whole week, of which 11,000 yuan was for the 19th Customs, 8,000 yuan for salt tax, 6,000 yuan for finance, and only a few thousand yuan for the rest. However, the futures market was quite active, and the market was more popular among buyers and sellers. It was found that the transaction volume was only 2-3 million yuan in the first two days of the week, and more than 5 million yuan on the remaining days, and nearly 7 million yuan on Thursday. The total transaction volume for the whole week was 28.1 million yuan, which exceeded 8.5 million yuan compared with the previous week. The long-term futures market alone was far better than the previous one, and the recent one was generally good. The middle-term salt tax was 2.65 million yuan for July and 3.065 million yuan for August. The unified tax was 2.575 million yuan for July and 2.13 million yuan for August. The 20th Customs was 1.88 million yuan for July and 2.075 million yuan for August. The 20th Roll was 1.59 million yuan for July and 1.645 million yuan for August. The demobilization was 1.43 million yuan for July and 2.2 million yuan for August. The 19th Customs was 1.74 million yuan for July and 940,000 yuan for August. The 19th Charity was 1.42 million yuan for July and 790,000 yuan for August. The reorganization was 610,000 yuan for July and 485,000 yuan for August. The reorganization of the Sixth Customs was relatively clear, the customs duty was 420,000 yuan, and the reorganization of the 6% was 360,000 yuan. Also, the transaction volume of the 96th July period was 65,000 yuan and the finance was 30,000 yuan. As for the changes in the prices of each bond, in the first two days of the week, although the prices were already declining, the rise and fall were peaceful, and each day was slightly smaller. At that time, the surrounding environment was depressing and the people were indifferent, and the demand and supply were still balanced. However, in the few days of Wednesday and Thursday, the market suddenly underwent major changes. The Japanese army invaded Rehe and bombed Chaoyang. The situation in the north was serious. The diplomacy with Japan was extremely tense. The people in the market felt greatly uneasy. All parties sold out one after another, resulting in a situation where</p>
<p>the demand and supply were very different, and the difference between the prices of each bond decreased sharply and consistently. Each day, the price decreased by more than one yuan to two yuan. The decline was rare in recent days. For example, the price of demobilization once dropped by more than four yuan at the lowest. Especially in the last two days of the week, the situation in the north eased slightly, so the people's minds were slightly settled, the buying and selling transactions were slightly smoother, and the price also fluctuated and rose slightly. However, judging from the situation of the current situation, I am afraid that optimism is not yet allowed. As a result, the price of each bond was slightly lower than the previous week by six or seven jiao to more than two yuan, but the spot price of demobilization fell by 3.9 yuan. The futures for the next month and the current month for the reorganization of the sixth bond and the spot goods for the 20th roll also fell by 2.8-9 yuan respectively. In addition, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange last week decided to stop the afternoon market transactions from last Wednesday for a temporary period of three weeks in order to facilitate business due to the hot weather. The highs, lows, and rises and falls of each bond last week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Spot Yarn Customer Sales of 26,000 Bales Weak</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market was still flat and weak at the beginning of the week. Later, because the various gangs in South China were very active and purchased spot yarn, they were extremely excited, and most of the goods from the factories in July and August were almost completely collected by them. Therefore, the market has been brewing for a long time, but it has failed to rise due to the sluggish domestic economy and the poor environment. Later, due to the improvement in actual demand, the three gangs of Yunnan, Guangdong, and Hunan came one after another to purchase spot goods, and the factories were overwhelmed. It is said that some spot yarns are out of stock, so the market price jumped by two or three taels. People's hearts tended to be high, and the heat was at its peak. In addition, it was reported that Japanese planes bombed Chaoyang and Rehe was tight. There was deep concern that the interior would increase inspection of inferior goods. As a result, speculators increased, and the buying atmosphere became more and more intense. On Friday, the price soared by three taels, four or five qian in half a day, but the foreign market was still sluggish, so large households dumped. Unexpectedly, there was a huge need in the southern port area, and the market suddenly showed a booming atmosphere. The Chinese factories were able to greatly ease their economy, and the bottom goods of each factory were reduced a lot. Therefore, judging from the general trend, it is not easy to decline for a while, but the price has risen by twelve taels compared with the lower price. If there is no special situation, it can be temporarily stabilized. The price of bid yarn rose by five taels and one or seven qian in a week. The total turnover for the whole week was 124,600 bales. The customer gangs bought 25,990 bales of spot yarn, and the three gangs of Guangdong, Changsha, and Yunnan accounted for 17,000 bales. The spot yarn market was also good at three, four, or five taels. The number of bales bought by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Gang Bales Gang Bales</p>
<p>Sichuan 3,690 Guangdong 10,825</p>
<p>Inland 780 Shantou 1,540</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Factory Purchases Also Gradually Active</p>
<p>The cotton market has been extremely calm for a week. In fact, after a major drop, there should be a period of long consolidation. However, most large households sold out unanimously. Although the pressure was heavy, it was not substantial, and it could not fall greatly for the time being. This is because the majority of buyers absorbed at low prices and were mentally stable. In addition, the price of American cotton rose by 7, 8, and 10 pounds per sound compared to the lower price. The gold market also formed a pattern of circling, and the silver plate was calculated between 32 and 33 taels. In addition, the stock of local cotton was too dry. Although there was a huge stock of American cotton in Shanghai, it could not be delivered to the standard. In addition, with the recent improvement in yarn sales, the attitude of each factory was not as stagnant as before, and it was often heard that they were purchasing, adding, and using them. Therefore, various situations can still be maintained for a while. As for the situation of American cotton, judging from the general trend, it is also in a calm situation. It is difficult to fall greatly at present. However, it is found that the number of bid cotton deposits is extremely large, with 638,000 dan. The future changes are not small. The price of bid cotton in each month was higher than the previous week by 4 qian 5 fen to 8 qian. The total turnover for the whole week was 232,500 dan. The spot price of American cotton fell by 15 pounds per sound compared to the previous week. The price and amount of spot cotton purchased by each factory are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to the good weather in American cotton and the poor spot demand, the market was weak due to the enthusiastic selling. It is estimated that futures fell by 9 pounds per sound and spot goods fell by 10 pounds per sound. British cotton futures rose by 3-4 points and spot goods rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was firm due to speculators buying in. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 2.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 2.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 3 rupees. Original Telegram Recorded Left (Telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sources of various gangs in Shanghai South were about 12-13. The stock in Pu was increasingly scarce. The Su Tong gang lacked connections. There were scattered movements of 600-700 shi. The market of fresh Zhongguan North japonica rice suddenly rose by 1-2 jiao. The arrival of early and late rice was scarce, following a rise of 2 jiao. The arrival and sales of Luyang tip were quiet, and the market also followed the show. The Yuan alcoholic beverage households had slight dealings. The opening price fell and rose by 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Xinzha Yesterday, more than a dozen ships arrived. There were not many people in the market in the morning, and it was deserted. Changsu white japonica rice and Jiangyin rice were the most expensive. The opening price rose by nearly a jiao. There were few qingjiao and bo rice in Ningwei. There was none in this street, so the price was tight again. The price of Yangdu tip was the same as the previous market. The arrival of special tips was limited. The road to this city was not smooth, and the trend was hardening.</p>

<p>American Sales Stagnated as Before''''' British and French Prices Increasingly Small</p>
<p>Inferior Silk Invaded Domestic Sales''''' Factory Fabric Sales Fell Miserably</p>
<p>Last week, the silk market of foreign firms in this port became increasingly lifeless. It was found that Japanese silk was sold at low prices in the United States, and the American sales of Chinese silk had been almost completely occupied. In addition, American silk merchants wanted to promote silk sales, and suppressed the silk prices to reduce the cost of raw silk fabrics for silk weavers, so that they could compete with rayon fabrics. The telegraph from Chinese silk was still considered too expensive, and the American sales stagnated as before. Lyon was controlled by hoarders, resulting in a continued decline in silk prices. In London, the telegraph prices of silk were all small due to the exchange rate. The sales of factory silk and satin were sluggish because a large number of inferior silks were transported and sold to the mainland, and the prices were cheaper, resulting in a great reduction in the sales of factory silk by the factory users, and the prices also fell miserably. Last week, silk sales became increasingly bad. The price of overseas Chinese silk was really lacking the possibility of rising due to the influence of the current trend. The price of European and American Chinese silk at the end of last week is listed below (New York price per pound, unit US dollars, Lyon per kilo, unit francs):</p>

<p>Recently, not much Jiazha coal from Xuzhou has arrived, and the sales are also stagnant. Only coal dust still has a small number of transactions. It can be said that there are no transactions for lump coal, so the price is also weakening day by day.

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Only with a good society can there be a good government, and only with good citizens can there be good leaders. When I examine our country's society and the nature of its people, I am filled with pessimism everywhere. The words "truly beyond cure" can encompass it all. There are many such events, and I will try to list three examples below:</p>
<p>Young people are especially prone to suicide. Suicide due to failed romance, suicide due to academic failure, suicide due to economic oppression. This kind of suicidal behavior completely demonstrates a lack of fighting spirit and strong character. As soon as they encounter setbacks, they think of ending their lives. This kind of concept completely reveals the fragility of the national character and the lack of the ability to shoulder heavy responsibilities and go the distance. This is the first instance of what I call "beyond cure."</p>
<p>As reported in newspapers, when our countrymen are kidnapped or robbed, foreigners, upon hearing of this, will bravely and selflessly come to their aid. However, our own people, even those who are police officers or patrolmen whose duty it is to maintain law and order, often shrink back when they hear of an alarm, thinking that it is not worth sacrificing their lives for a few tens of dollars in salary. Even within a family, it is likely the same. Fathers and brothers, seeing their sons and younger brothers being kidnapped, are secretly pleased that they themselves escaped. Sons and younger brothers, seeing their fathers and elder brothers being robbed, are secretly pleased that they escaped quickly. As for neighbors being kidnapped or robbed, they are even more likely to close their doors tightly, not daring to go out. This kind of selfish and self-serving mentality is the root cause of national and familial ruin. It is unique to our countrymen, who disregard public morality and do not understand righteousness. Such a group of people will naturally fall apart. This is the second instance of what I call "beyond cure."</p>
<p>The September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident. The shame and suffering our country has endured were so severe. How long ago was it that the five-minute burst of enthusiasm has already passed? People are now resenting and abandoning each other, completely forgetting the past. According to the customs trade reports, the import of Japanese goods to the South last month decreased by only 15% compared to last year. The import to the North even exceeded last year by 25%. This one point alone is enough to show that the people's hearts are dead. What else is there to say? Moreover, Puyi even took advantage of the incidents to become a puppet, and people in Jiangbei took advantage of the incidents to become traitors. Our countrymen have no conscience and no concept of the nation. It has reached this extreme. This is the third instance of what I call "beyond cure."</p>
<p>The above situations, if you pay attention, can be seen everywhere in our society. These matters seem small, but the country's hopelessness, helplessness, and lack of a way out lie in them.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Discussion on Reforming Men's Clothing with an Additional Suggestion to Reform Women's Shorts <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The other day, Mr. Zhang Su suggested reforming men's clothing. Indeed, the current clothing needs to be reformed. Not only should men's long robes, which drag in the mud and water, be reformed, but also women's shorts, which are now so short that they expose the thighs, should also be reformed. Otherwise, these two temptations of exposed thighs will mislead countless young people.</p>
<p>Clothes are meant to protect the body. Men's woolen socks in summer and women's silk stockings and shorts in winter are too unhygienic. Speaking of Western suits, although they are beautiful and convenient, wearing them is too troublesome and too aristocratic. Moreover, wearing only shorts in the summer is too stuffy. Therefore, this member suggests that men's clothing should follow the style of student uniforms for the upper body, which is both convenient and elegant, and conforms to Mr. Zhang's principle of "no longer than the knees and no shorter than the waist." It can also express the attitude of a scholar. As for the lower body, I think shorts are the most lightweight and suitable, but the length should reach the knees, otherwise it would be indecent.</p>
<p>An old villager saw the modern young masters and ladies and raised a question, saying that it can truly be considered civilization now. Women's pants have gone from very long to now seemingly nonexistent. Men, on the other hand, have gone from shorts (many farmers wear shorts) to pants that almost drag on the ground. Alas, strange, is it civilization? Or demonization? Therefore, this member wants to attach a suggestion to reform women's shorts in addition to discussing men's clothing.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Short pants and thin silk stockings cannot protect the body in cold weather.</p>
<p>(2) They are detrimental to public morals and tempt young people to go astray. Therefore, this member proposes that the length of women's pants must be longer than the knees. Is this appropriate? Please submit it to your association for joint discussion by all members. Respectfully, Social Reform Discussion Society. Member: Huai Jingcheng</p>
<h3 id="e191">Suggestions for Reforming the Marriage System <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Dingming</p>
<p>In this era of the intersection of new and old ideas, before all the old systems of our Chinese society are thoroughly destroyed and new revolutionary buildings are rebuilt, all phenomena in society are distorted. In particular, the most important issue in the surging history of life is marriage. This issue has a significant relationship with society and will also affect the future of the country and the nation. Because the family is the foundation of society, and the family is based on marriage as a prerequisite, so we must study national issues and social reform. In addition to the new construction of education and politics, I dare say this is also an important issue. Looking at recent times, aren't people committing suicide enthusiastically for marriage? If we let it grow without taking measures, wouldn't there be great harm to society! I can first talk about the evils of the old marriage system in general:</p>
<p>1.  The union of old marriages is completely dictated by the old ethics: "Parents' orders and matchmakers' words." Neither party can meet, nor can they mutually examine each other's character, family situation, and everything else. Everything is based on false material goals. Such blind marriages cannot be established on the principle of love at all. You must know that marriage should be based on love, otherwise it will only result in a resentful couple, and they will feel immense pain and sorrow in their spirits for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>2.  The procedures for old marriages are both troublesome, and all the rituals are too feudal and wasteful under this revolutionary trend. Like bride price (which can be said to be a sale of one's body), and the arguing over the length of clothing and decorations, and the ostentatious display of face, the marriage expenses of those in the bourgeoisie often consume thousands or tens of thousands of yuan. Those in the petty bourgeoisie even go bankrupt or incur heavy debts because of it, while those in the proletariat simply cannot talk about it. They can only embrace celibacy invisibly. Many young people with true love cannot achieve a satisfactory ending due to the encirclement of this evil custom, or even lead to tragedy. Therefore, this man-eating old custom must be thoroughly eliminated, and at the same time, the government should strictly prohibit it. If there are those who outwardly comply but inwardly defy, and do not obey the prohibition, they must be given appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>3.  There is no standard for the age limit for old marriages. There are underage and immature men and women who are forced by their parents to marry early, which damages their physical strength and life expectancy. In the affairs of the country and society, they are also indirectly harmed. This should also be strictly prohibited by the government.</p>
<p>In addition to striving to overthrow the above-mentioned obstacles to sacred love, we must also do the following:</p>
<p>1.  The end point of love is marriage. Marriage is an urgent pursuit in our life history. If there is no deep understanding and careful consideration beforehand, it will inevitably lead to lifelong regret and an indelible trauma, leading to a decline in will, or even a lack of interest in the world. Therefore, after we get to know each other, we must have an understanding of the following conditions before we can enter into an engagement: A. Understanding of each other's character. B. Examination of academic level. C. Testing the truth of the love. D. Investigation of family situation. In short, the standard of marriage in this era should not be mixed with material things or sexual pursuits and other influential conditions. After doing it this way, there will definitely be painful results. In this distorted society, among hypocritical humans, we should rather be prudent at the beginning, and not leave regret for later.</p>
<p>2.  When both parties in the above first article are satisfied, and there has been a considerable period of love, an introducer can be invited to obtain the consent of both parents, and then enter into an engagement. The method should be the simplest, absolutely abolishing the buying and selling style. The method is as follows: Both parties exchange tokens of love, take commemorative engagement photos together, or announce it in the newspaper.</p>
<p>3.  After the engagement, when there is a possibility of bearing family burdens in one's own productive capacity, one can get married. The ceremony should be based on the newest style ceremony as the standard. In fact, absolutely no extravagance should be made, and no money should be wasted. For example, hold the ceremony in a hotel or in the auditorium of any organization or group. Relatives and friends who attend the wedding should be prepared with tea and snacks or simple wine and dishes to show joy. To the simplest, this kind of formal etiquette is not necessary. As long as both parties agree, they can announce in the newspaper and start living together. Love focuses on the spirit, so there is no need to stick to the form.</p>

I Wrote This to Thank Him. <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Wangzun</p>
<p>How can one be so cold?</p>
<p>Even in summer, I wear winter clothes.</p>
<p>The blackness does not reach the ink stand,</p>
<p>How can heat enter the rustic spleen?</p>
<p>I often have the intention of approaching the abyss,</p>
<p>It is not without thoughts of correcting the world.</p>
<p>How many cold and hot seasons in life?</p>
<p>How much heat can one get?</p>
<p>Entrusting my body to a coffin,</p>
<p>That is my summer escape.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>The heat is very intense,</p>
<p>Not entering the houses of the rich,</p>
<p>Only scorching the backs of rickshaw pullers,</p>
<p>Burning a piece of their flesh.</p>
<p>Burning them until they are about to ignite,</p>
<p>They run quickly, but still not fast enough.</p>
<p>The young rickshaw pullers shake their straw hats,</p>
<p>Gazing at the tall buildings with envious eyes.</p>
<p>Hurriedly dragging to the alley entrance,</p>
<p>They argue over a few copper coins.</p>
<p>Alas, you must not argue over what is not enough,</p>
<p>Idle rickshaw pullers by the roadside,</p>
<p>Their backs are scorched, and they are hungry and crying.</p>

<h3 id="e194">How to Make White Pigments <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>There are many types of white pigments, among which the most important are the following four. Now I will describe their manufacturing methods separately:</p>
<p>(1) Basic Carbonate White Lead (PbCO3)2Pb(OH)2: This pigment is made by the interaction of carbon dioxide and lead oxide. There are two methods:</p>
<p>(1) French Method: Dissolve lead oxide as much as possible in an aqueous solution of lead acetate to make basic lead acetate. Then, carbon dioxide is introduced, and white lead powder precipitates out. Filter it, and the filtrate still contains lead acetate, so lead oxide can be dissolved again to make white lead powder. This is the new method.</p>
<p>(2) Dutch Method: Put acetic acid (the strength of which is about the same as acid vinegar) in earthen bottles, place lead plates on top, and surround them with waste animal and plant matter. Because of its fermentation, heat and carbon dioxide are released. Acetic acid forms vapor due to heat and interacts with lead to produce basic lead acetate, which is then transformed into basic carbonate lead salt, that is, basic carbonate white lead powder, under the action of carbon dioxide. These reactions are very slow, taking about 100 to 130 days. This is the old method.</p>
<p>The percentage composition of basic carbonate white lead powder is approximately 75% lead carbonate and 25% lead hydroxide, or 85% lead hydroxide and 15% carbon dioxide and water. When it comes into contact with hydrogen sulfide gas, it turns black because black lead sulfide is produced.</p>
<p>(2) Zinc White (ZnO): There are two methods for its preparation:</p>
<p>(1) American Method: Use anthracite to reduce zinc ore to metallic zinc. Its vapor flows out from the top of the furnace, mixes with air, and burns into zinc white.</p>
<p>(2) French Method: Refine metallic zinc in flowing air, generating vapor, which burns into zinc oxide (i.e., pure white) white fumes.</p>
<p>Zinc white is bright and pure white, and is mostly used for porcelain glaze. It does not change color when it reacts with sulfide gas, because zinc sulfide is also white.</p>
<p>(3) Basic Sulfate White Lead (PbSO4)2Pb(OH)2: Bake galena (PbS), and the fumes that are volatilized are oxidized in the air to form basic sulfate white lead powder. This is a very good white pigment. Its percentage composition is 75% lead sulfate, 20% lead oxide, and 5% zinc oxide. Its chemical properties are extremely stable, and it will not turn black when reacting with sulfides. It is better than basic carbonate white lead powder for coating wooden objects.</p>
<p>(4) Lithopone (BaSO4ZnS): The method of manufacturing this pigment is to mix solutions of zinc sulfate and barium sulfide, which will precipitate insoluble barium sulfate and zinc sulfide at the same time. The reaction is:</p>
<p>ZnSO4 + BaS → ZnS + BaSO4</p>
<p>This precipitate contains 70% to 75% barium sulfate, and the rest is zinc sulfide. This mixed precipitate is not suitable for use as a pigment. It must be calcined to a dark red color and suddenly thrown into water to form soft blocks. Then, it is ground into powder, washed with water, and dried to become a very good white pigment.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Going to Listen to Storytelling <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Of course, going to listen to storytelling is not as fashionable as playing golf, but from a certain standpoint, the storytelling venue still has no shortage of listeners. In Shanghai, wherever you can find a rectangular wooden board hanging above a fried bun stall, it is written that "This building has specially invited Guangyu Society's famous artist XXX to perform XXX", etc. You university students in wide-leg pants and young masters in stiff collars must not recklessly step up this shaky staircase, because when you see the few square feet of this humble room, with several benches lying haphazardly, the ground covered with melon seed shells, and the unique smell, you will shake your head and quickly turn back the last step that has not yet stepped on the floor.</p>
<p>What is now being said about "going to listen to storytelling" obviously does not refer to listening to the Shanghai opera tune. Like a few old seniors, bending over and arching their water pipes, are nailed to the fixed seat (slang) regardless of wind and rain, like smoking opium, they cannot live a day without it. You must first dress yourself in a flowery attire. The Western-style pants must be ironed like the vertical lines in geometry, and the two-inch high stiff collar supports your entire head. After dinner, wander around on Nanjing Road. Two sharp eyes seek your starting point, and send yourself into the body from the towering room, lying in a comfortable armchair, drinking delicious fragrant tea, not asking who is singing on the stage, your ears can steal listening to the private whispers in the next seat, and if there is a chance to interject, like a golden fly stinging a stinky duck egg, you can add to it. If you are a politician-style socialite, it is not difficult to get the other party's response, because their slogan is, "Everyone here is our comrade," and a comrade of course has the right to speak. Your eyes are even more free, as you look around left and right, and your nose also uses its wonders. Under the gentle electric fan, you can no longer think of those proletarians who are sleeping unsteadily because the heat in the house is too high, lying on the asphalt road and being coveted by city tigers. If really all of this does not suit your taste, you can close your eyelids and go to the dreamland to pursue everything you want. The price of twenty cents will not be considered a great loss in your life.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Poor Ah K <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>Ah K, the eldest sister in the Huang Mansion, is so lovely. Every part of her demeanor shows her health and beauty. Her jet-black hair, oval face, full breasts, and vigorous steps – she really doesn't look like someone who works as an eldest sister.</p>
<p>Meisheng, the young master in the Huang Mansion, is a young man who calls himself a romantic talent. When he saw how beautiful Ah K had grown, he immediately had bad intentions. He did not hesitate to use his position as a young master to mess around with her. As for Ah K? After all, she doesn't understand the ways of the world. In her eyes, she thought that getting the young master's favor was the supreme glory. She couldn't resist Meisheng's sweet words and various temptations, and she finally became intoxicated and lost her chastity.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, their secret was discovered by Meisheng's mother. The old lady thought that the relationship between master and servant was a great shame. She couldn't help but give Meisheng a lesson first, and then suspended Ah K, while scolding her ("rotten goods, shameless thing"). Poor Ah K, although she was harboring endless resentment, she did not dare to resist at all, and she had no courage to tell Mrs. Huang that Meisheng had already destroyed her chastity. All that could be seen was her head down, tears flowing, slowly walking out of the Huang family's door.</p>
