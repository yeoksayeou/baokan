<h3 id="c1">熱河告急彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>九一八禍變以來。熱河一隅。於强敵虎瞰之下。僅以維持其殘喘。據最近消息。則日本軍閥本莊繁已令各地日軍集中熱河省境。準備大舉進攻。倡言熱河爲「東洋和平之確保線。」以爲進攻熱河之口實。此一隅殘存之土在强敵大舉攻襲之下。其危殆蓋不言可知。熱河而危。其進襲平津之計劃。亦可同時發動此於日人最近宣言。惟戰爭可以解决世界經濟恐慌。及其購買大批軍火。積極擴張軍備諸事實中。即可以確信其準備進窺華北。繼續掀起第二第三之淞滬慘變。日本軍閥亦早已公開宣言。</p>
<p>熱河而一旦有失。則平津必爲震動設使平津復防守不固任敵馳驅則我國殆眞即僅圖偏安而亦不可得。故今日我國實已臨到最後之難關。存亡生死。皆於此决。</p>
<p>過去乞憐呼助之外交。退讓苟安之政策。實效究如何我政府今亦應已有最後之覺悟。十閱月來。不以武力收回失地。不正式出師討伐僞國坐使强敵樹立僞國。并得以完成其侵略計劃我即讓人。人仍犯我。不抵抗之政策適以自誤。顧最近乃尚有人主張遷就日本軍閥造成之事實欲與接洽以冀阻遏其侵略之野心。其計抑何左也。</p>
<p>逞日本軍閥之野心。勢非至鯨呑我整個國家不足以滿其慾彼侵東北。我讓東北。被窺熱河。我讓熱河。設使彼進攻平津。以至長江流域則通讓之極。究以何地爲止乎。寗爲玉碎。不爲瓦全。吾人今究乎。抑爲玉碎乎。求瓦全而不可得。則吾人又將何以自處乎。</p>
<p>以故吾人堅决主張。對於犯熱之敵軍。應準備迎頭之抗禦。同時更策劃收回失地。討伐僞國之全盤計劃。準備發動廣大之民族革命戰爭。</p>
<p>至於目前平津地位。極關重要。懲於過去東北喪失之易。政府對於平津之防務。以及負責長官之遴選。尤必迅速確定嚴密之籌劃。吾人認爲平津之負　長官。必須遴選富於朝氣。　於負責。責而又能以民族生命爲前提之大員前往坐鎭。彼昏庸荏弱。暮氣已　。苟安旦夕。日惟沉面於鴉片酣舞之徒。實不足以言國是以當此重任。政府爲整飭紀綱計。爲挽救華北計。爲免一誤再誤計。此時應有最後之决心。亦應作斷然之處置。事急矣。優柔寡斷。終必誤國。政府愼勿遷就事實。或徇私情。以陷我國家於萬刧不復之深淵。</p>

<p>中興公司怠工</p>
<p>濟南通信、魯省淄博兩縣及嶧縣之煤鑛區、近均發生工潮、茲紀其情形如次、</p>
<p>淄博煤鑛魯東博山淄川兩縣、爲魯省著名之煤區、現除中日合辦之淄川魯大公司規摸最大外、其餘多由我國開採、計大小公司四十餘家、礦井五十餘個、煤質以博山之黑山等地最佳、可以開溶鐵質、淄川煤質稍遜、博山多高山間隔、鑛田頗嫌零碎、最大者不過二千餘畝、不宜大規模開採、故德日皆棄之、而在淄川之大荒地組大規模之公司、現在之魯大公司、名爲中日合辦、實則日人獨營、博山各鑛田、則由我國商人開採、然規模皆不甚大、　本最多者二三十萬元、少者十餘萬元數萬元不等、統計各公司之產量、每日可出煤四千餘噸、魯大公司二千噸、合計每日共出六千餘噸、全年二百餘萬噸、除供給膠濟沿路用魯東各地外、多數由靑島出口運往上海銷售、漢口廣州次之、間有運銷日本大阪横濱等地者、然爲數甚少、</p>
<p>魯煤旣以上海爲主要銷貨塲、現因滬上煤價跌落之關係、魯煤因成本較高、不足與撫順·開　·中興等抗爭、銷路遂一落千丈、魯煤價高之原因、不外抽稅高·運費高·工資高三種、其中關於工資者、去年春間採煤工人、毎人每大班（每一晝夜爲一大班）工資在一元二角上下、去年秋間、因各處閙煤荒、煤價頗高、而銷售暢快、各公司爲增加產額、皆抬高工價、爭雇工人、故工價漲至兩元、亦間有兩元以上者、</p>
<p>各公司爲維持營業與外煤競爭計、經礦業公會議决、自本月七日起、外公司一律裁减工資四分之一、以前工資四元者、减爲一元五角、卽以此數爲標準、不得過高可過低、各礦工人、以與生活有關、羣相反對、自七日至九日間、次第罷工、淄博兩縣除魯大及博東公司外、罷工者共萬餘人、惟各公司機器部仍須照常開工、否則鑛井卽被水淹、故公司方面、仍需一部分開支、共計每日損失四千餘元、工人態度、主張照以前工價、如裁减十分之一、卽可復工、因各工人多爲按日計算之散工、平時旣無組織、罷工後復散居於家、互存觀望、絲毫不能團結也、現經各公司與工會方面接洽、聞多數工人、已允許復工、工資照前數裁减四分之一、并傳勞資兩方、業已妥協訂立合同、但至今（十七）日尚未完全復工耳、</p>

<p>學生應如何利用暑假劉·湛·恩·</p>
<p>暑假將届、全國學校都在準備放假、作一結束了、可是就過去的歷程看來、每年暑假期内、多數學生、總免不了任情游戯恣意口腹、因此精神疲乏、釀成疾病、這都是不能瞭暑假意義、善用暑假的緣故、</p>
<p>暑假時的學生、仍須愛惜光陰、努力品格、修養鍛練身體、並且多與社會接觸研究、平常無暇研究的學術、在此假期、不可飽食終日、無所用心、專作無益有害之事、</p>
<p>今年的暑假、環境更與往年不同、内則水災未復、外則强敵壓境、東北之河山變色、淞滬之創痕猶新、値此國難當前、已臨生死關頭、學生旣爲國家將來中堅份子、臥薪嘗胆、積極求知、培養奮鬥實力、且不暇給、寗有假期可言、所以除普通暑假工作外、更應利用暑假、作救國事業、如（一）實施民衆敎育、（二）提倡國貨、（三）參加社會改良事業、（四）宣傳廢止内戰、積極建設、一致對外、均可爲其努力範勢、</p>
<p>現在申報因爲指導學生、利用暑假舉行懸獎徵文、題目重在實踐、並規定無論大中小學學生、都可應徵、此種鼓勵靑年方法、實含重大敎育意義、深盼全國學校當局及學生家長、一致勉勵予弟參加、俾從此全國靑年、曉然於暑假的利用、</p>

<p>何應欽演詞軍政部長何應欽演詞云、今天是陳英士先生紀念堂落成開幕之日、本人也有機會、前來參加盛典、實在非常榮幸、關於英士先生過去努力革命的種種事蹟、以及其個人的思想與性格、凡是對他崇拜景仰的人、想來大家都很有相當的認識、更用不着我來一點一滴的叙述、不過我們當着國家多難憂患交迫的今日、内則赤匪肆虐、毒痛數省、外則日人侵略、强佔東北、我們今天又來到這曾經日人飛機砲艦轟炸摧毀的上海、紀念十餘年前爲革命而犠牲的陳先生、我們見於陳先生勇往直前、百折不回的革命精神、益感覺得今後革命責任的重要與鉅大、只有希望本黨同志、全國同胞、精誠團結、一致努力、共同來擔此重要鉅大之革命責任、使中華民族走入自由平等的坦途、英士先生嘗對人說、「我生平最恨强權、并喜打不平、凡是見到有以强凌弱的事、必爲憤憤不平、現在世界仍舊是一個不平的世界、所以我願意作世界革命的工作、不過現在的中國、尤其要從速革命、我又是中國人、因此我先着手於中國的革命、俟中國革命成功以後、我當盡力助各弱國及亡國之民革命、務使世界上强權、能完全　除、全世界民族、統能獲得獨立自由、我的志願、　算能完全達到」、英士先生的遇害、是在民國五年五月十八日、他雖然因爲見忌於袁世凱、　志以没未能及見中國國民革命之成功、更無從償其世界大同之大志、但是他的救中國救人類的這種偉大精神、也就値得我們的佩服與效法了、現在日本對我中國、處處持强凌弱、將國際間一切和产公約、毀棄不顧、而國際間亦始終無人主持公理、對强暴者予以嚴厲之制裁、所謂全世界民族之獨立自由、實在　去題甚遠、我們現在要紀念陳先生、應該本着先生勇毅冒險前進奮鬭的精神、對於日人强暴無理的侵略、持以長久繼續的抵抗、務使强權消滅、公理得伸、而後中華民族、乃能自已得到解救、而後乃能盡力以助各弱國及亡國之民族、互謀解救、又赤匪爲禍、逾於猛獸洪水、近年以來、每利用時機、阻撓國民革命之前進、今歲抗日軍事、尤受其影響不小、我們現在要紀念陳先生、要完成陳先生由努力中國國民革命、進而努力世界大同的工作、尤其應該全國一致、集中力量、來把赤匪根本消滅、庶幾國民革命、可無後顧之憂、而堅固其一致對外之壁壘、英士先生又常對人說、「機會必須由創造而來、决不能由等候而來、我們若能努力創造機會、則雖然本身不能坐待成功、也可以造一大潮流、以促進社會的進步、」英士先生、是一個革命的實行家、他雖然屢次失敗、但仍不斷的前進、决不嶦望徘徊、以待革命機會之自來、今日中國國民革命之能有此基礎、自然是由於總理偉大的精神、與人格所創造、但是英士先生忠實服從總理主義、積極佐助革命進行、雖然不能成功、郤已做到成仁、我們今天在甫告落成的紀念堂内、來紀念他、最好大家把他這些遺言、來牢牢記住、切實照行、對於國民革命之成功、定可得到不少的帮助、</p>
<p>葉楚傖演詞在這富麗堂皇會場裏、紀念光明偉大的陳英士先生、我們可以得到一概念、便是光明是從困苦裏得來的、我們當此國難臨頭之時、今天在這富麗堂皇的紀念堂裏、報告英士先生的歷史、贊美英士先生的人格、同時我們更須知道英士先生從前的困苦、在從前普通的人有路走、英士先生没有路走、普通的人有屋住、英士先生没有屋住、差不多天下之大、在那反動軍閥的勢力之下、竟没有英士先生的容身之所、從前英士先生住在漁陽里的一個小樓中、計劃着全國的軍政大事、這個富麗堂皇的紀念堂、便是從那爲人所不容的小樓裏得來的、在這裏、我們便可以證明光明是從困苦中得來的、現在困難又來了、且十百倍於英士先生那時所感受的困難、那末、我們又將怎樣去從困苦中去找尋光明來呢、我們現在明知學不了英士先生、但我們還得要學英士先生、就是學英士先生從困苦中去找尋光明出來、</p>
<p>王曉籟演詞陳英士先生之革命精神、是爲全國人民所欽仰、余與英士先生原係知友、曾追隨於先生之左右、故得見先生偉大之精神、先生沉默寡言、說做就做、絶無猶豫、故其議論少而成功多、先生非但爲國家努力、卽農工商亦受惠不淺、如市商會之得有今日在天后宮橋如此偉大之會所、亦乃得之先生於滬軍都督時代之助力也、今日諸君紀念先生、當毋忘先生所遺留之革命精神、今後有敢勇於内戰、卽對不住英士先生、不能一致對外、卽對不住英士先生、不提倡國貨、卽對不住英士先生、我們要精神團結、共禦外侮、方不負今天紀念先生之意義、</p>

<p>僞國選派少女請願團·到東洋去要求承認其中領班，喚做于若蘭！旣是漢姓，當然是個漢族，女子，爲什麽去充僞國的代表呢？我閱報至此，便道一句妙哉于若蘭！</p>
<p>有人說：這事很不妙，妙在那裏？我說：事情兒很不妙，名義上却很妙—只爲，少女兩字，恰恰凑成一個妙字。妙哉于若蘭！詩興一齊來：</p>
<p>丨丨妙哉！妙哉！奴家姓于名若蘭！</p>
<p>做了漢族女子，郤去跳東牆女子邊干，—西廂成句充一名女姓漢奸，到東洋三島去頑頑，</p>
<p>頑頑，頑頑，管什麽坍了十七八世祖宗的臺。</p>
<p>丨妙哉！妙哉！少女團中充領班！</p>
<p>捧着侏儒足下的木屐，呐喊着萬歲足下，足下萬歲！</p>
<p>早早把關東僞國，承認爲名義上的獨立江山！</p>
<p>好敎那木屐兒獨來獨往，獨往獨來！</p>
<p>再也不許姓馮的去占海，姓馬的去占山。</p>
<p>妙哉！妙哉！少女領袖一朶蘭！</p>

<p>冒名頂替，算是芳蘭。</p>
<p>旣不是空谷蘭，又不是九畹蘭！</p>
<p>這朶蘭花，敢是生在猪頭山？</p>
<p>便不是生在猪頭山，也應產在牛糞堆！</p>

<h3 id="c197">花槍錢 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>汪星伯先生在將要首途赴蘇州的當兒，告訴我以他的國術老師花槍錢文明先生的歷史，我聽了覺得十分奇特，現在揮汗筆述了出來。</p>
<p>籍貫和别號　花槍錢是鎭江錢家村人。因爲他使得一路好花槍，舞動的時候，長如匹練，圓如團月，混身風雨不露，所以别人送一個綽號給他，呌做「花槍錢」。</p>
<p>拳技的特點　花槍錢的拳術是福傳的；此拳的特點在不剛不柔，没有少林門的太硬而高壓化，没有太極門的過軟而無抵抗似的兩重弊病；槍法的妙處在陰陽手的把捉靈活這一點、以及毫不用力地勁出於一刹那間。</p>
<p>形態與軼事　花槍錢身高而瘦，不修邊幅，走起路來，奄奄如病人，常拿一根三尺多長的銅頭鋼骨旱烟袋；但在烟袋的外面，密　漆黑的絲繩；抽起烟來，不費吹灰之力的只用嘴斜噙着，和木質烟管一般，所以在第三者的眼簾裏，也不過是普通的病鬼罷了！可是一遇到那話兒事情發生，便如生龍活虎般勇猛，而烟袋同時也變做他的護身武器了</p>
<p>飯量　花槍錢，每飯米三升，鷄鴨二只，食量眞大呀！汪先生十五年前，常常請他吃飯，量兼鄕村人十倍；有天晚上到汪先生家裏，汪先生們剛要吃畢了，挽留他同吃，他老人家就不客氣地高踞在上面，把當夜十多個女傭的飯吃完還不算，連第二天汪先生的全家早餐也呑了個精光，結果還說不飽咧！</p>
<p>行爲年齡與家世　汪先生十幾年來没得花槍錢的消息；聽說這位老先生是窮而益堅又不事生產的腹裝大飯桶的人，年年過着流浪的生活；生平不多害病，倘使有病，也只消禪坐片時，便霍然而愈了！現在約摸八十三歲；有子，姪，外甥各一，統統有相當的傳授；三人中尤其以他的姪兒是卓卓者！</p>
<p>感想　我聽了錢老師一切的一切，極表欽佩，精神也着實敱舞不少；愛好武術的心理也緊張了九分；但是，可惜像這樣的老人家，没有整個兒廣授門徒，更没有研究科學，没有明瞭現代的時勢，不能夠進一步給社會有點小貢獻，哦！就讓他活上八百零三歲，也只馬馬虎虎空過一世罷了！</p>
<h3 id="c198">皮鞋大王巴泰 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 馬峻操</p>
<p>目前實業界裏最有名的「無冕之王」。</p>
<p>自然要數著美國的汽車大王福特。他的思想。見解。生平。都有人說過了。這裏。我來介紹一位歐洲的福特——捷克拉斯夫的皮鞋大王巴泰。巴泰在東亞的名望。雖没有瑞典火柴大王克魯格那麽響。但是他倆的死於非命。却是一樣的。巴泰的思想見解。和福特如出一轍。就是他們和生平。也很彷佛相似。</p>
<p>巴泰生在捷克斯拉夫的鄕間。他的父親也是一個鞋匠。所以他從小就帮著他父親做皮鞋。應酬顧客。和兜攬生意。十八歲時（一八九四年）。他就自已開一所小規模的鞋店。但是生意並不甚好。到了一九○四年。他决定到美國和法國去學習新式的製鞋和推銷方法。回國後。他就採用福特的大量生產原理。增高効率。減低成本。這樣一來。他的事業。一天興旺一天。在歐洲大戰的時候。他專造軍用的皮鞋。並且賺到好多的錢。</p>
<p>巴泰的鞋廠有三十二所。僱用工人一七·六○○人。每天的產額爲皮鞋九○·○○○雙。橡皮鞋四○·○○○雙。睡室拖鞋四·○○○雙。其他特種鞋五·○○○雙。發行所在本國境内有一·九四六處。在國外的有一五三處。皮鞋的銷塲。不但遍及全歐（蘇俄除外）。并且遠及美國埃及等處。除了鞋廠之外。巴泰還經營與製鞋有關的皮革廠。紗廠。紡織廠。樹膠廠等。所以他出品的成本中。原料方面可以特别便宜。</p>
<p>巴泰成功的主要原因。並不是原料的低廉。他對於贏利的分配特别注意。每個工人都肯自已負責。因爲贏利的分配是拿各個工人工作効率做標準的。巴泰對於工人的待遇。完全和福特一樣。廠裏有免費的補習學校。醫院。電影院。宿舍。還有廉價的餐館。消費社。他的皮鞋價格雖然自六元六角的平均數減至一元五角。但工人的工資反增加了三倍。</p>
<p>巴泰唯一的嗜好是航空。他備有許多的私人飛機。他的使用飛機。好像普通富翁使用汽車一般。五年前曾因了機翼著火。墮地受了重傷。這次他假使能夠安在内廂。决不致於裂屍四段。這也只能說他命運不好了。</p>

<p>— 勞人</p>
<p>酷暑逼人。晚餐後。和二三知已納凉小院中。暢譚古今作消夏資料。韓子志淵。爲述嘉興與杭州最近發生之兩件冒充新文學家事件。無獨有偶。相映成趣。令人忍俊不置。</p>
<p>女學校中之假李達　上海有一位新文學家。名呌李達。知道他的人很多。在去年學校秋季始業時。嘉興中山女子中學。接受杭州友人的推薦書。聘請了一位國學敎員。當開講的那兩天。這位新敎授滔滔不絶。在女學生面前。叙述自已的歷史。他嘗說。鄙人李達。濳心研究新文學。已十餘年。雖然達到現正的地位。仍覺不滿。因爲學問是無止境的。所以本有很希望全級同學。都本此旨做去。方不負父母師長的期望。一面並將李達出版的書籍。提要鈎玄。再加圈批註。分發給學生參考。不到增月的工夫。竟使　般鶑鶑燕燕。把這位新文學家李敎授佩服得五體投地。一時消息傳播到外面。各學校都紛紛聘請演講。不料二三月後。中山女子中學當局。忽然把這位文學家辭退了。學生因爲挽留無效。還罷課要挾了好幾天。有人說。李敎授實在太漂亮了。環境不適於在女學校敎書的。其實事後據人調查。這位敎授。並不是李達。是一個杭州的新聞記者。至於他冒育的意義在那裏。究非外人所能知道的了。</p>
<p>西裝少年冒充魯迅　魯迅的大名。社會上知道的人更多了。在某一個時期。杭州忽然發現一位西裝少年。滿面子思。頭髮蓄得長得可怕。並且胸前懸了一條極大的黑領結。充滿藝術家色彩。每天必獨自一人。携杖到湖山勝處邀遊。遊畢。必定在壁上留「魯迅到此一遊」六字而去。</p>
<p>有一天。一位姓嚴的少年。不期的和他在虎跑遇見。以爲機會難逢。立刻向前致仰慕之辭。第二天復率領了十幾位小說迷的朋友。到旅館中去拜訪他。同時由各人輪流作東。在酒樓裏歡聚了好幾日。後來。有一位上海的文學家。到旅館訪問他。他竟餉以閉門羹。夤夜　擋行李。遷移他去。次日。杭州報上登同一大段新聞。略謂「小學敎員周太素。冒充文學家魯迅。被人發覺。逃逸不知所終。」庸人自擾。像這一類的事件。未免太無意識了</p>

<p>自殺爲千古慘事。亦爲千古疑案。然而從未有人將此中玄秘。盡情宣露。終致迷離惝恍，眞相莫明。今日自殺案之所以日見增多。而莫或制止。未始不由於此也。红葉居士本悲天憫人之旨。撰著「自殺以後眞相」一書。根據學理。徵引繁富。允稱佳作。全書分爲三章。第一章講自殺之痛苦。關於投河自縊槍殺等種種痛苦。分類詳述。悉取才於西國專家之作。非向壁虚造可比。最近靑年。更有一種新奇死法。即横臥鐵道上俟火車至截爲數段。此純以斯賓賽生物學原理爲背景。實屬慘酷已極。除將該項學說。痛加駁斥外。更引西國最新學理。詮釋自殺痛苦。　翻科學陳舊思想。第二章談死後眞相。羅致中外事實。證明死後痛苦。有非可以言語形容者。如西國之千里眼及靈感會中所經歷。悉充作資料。離奇動聽。第三章爲理性的評判。以精深的哲理。評論世俗的弊病。語語中肯。可稱對症良方焉。（欲讀此書者。請開明姓名住址。並附郵票一分。寄上海外日暉橋南洋中學補習科）</p>

<h3 id="c202">牡丹花下死的人生觀 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>在此複雜混亂的社會狀態中，人生的觀念，原是格外的不一致，有以陞官發財爲人生觀，有以嫖賭吃着爲人生觀，有以英雄豪傑爲人生觀，有以名儒碩學爲人生觀，有以吹牛拍馬爲人生觀，總而方之，可說一人有一人的人生觀，人生觀原無一定的界說，古人「牡丹花下死，做鬼也風流，」原是一句俏皮話，諷刺話，而現在社會中，竟有别開生面，以「牡丹花下死做鬼也風流」爲人生觀者，眞是天下之奇聞。</p>
<p>近來報章所載，雙雙情侶，死於黄浦，死於旅館中者，不知凡幾，眞是情極了眞是情到死，死了還要情，好似天生我人，毫無其他作用，祇有爲了「寫情書」，「談情話」，祗爲了「開司」，爲了「肉慾」，人生的全部，完全爲情的犠牲品，所謂牡丹花下死做鬼也風流，眞是咄咄怪事，即如昨日本報所載，水巡捕房在十六號浮筒處，撈獲男女靑年屍體各一具，兩屍合抱一處，有褲帶一根，將兩屍繫住，顯爲失戀情死，聞男名阮成勳，女名徐菊英，此其一例也。</p>
<p>惟情之爲用，其義至廣，如父母之愛其子女，是情，子女之孝其父母，亦是情，推而至於兄弟姊妹親戚朋友，相親相愛，無一而非情，難道情之意義，祇有如此如此，方得爲情，如此而外，就無情可言麽？假定眞如此，則四馬路每體尼蔭路上的許詐多多情人，一個個到黄浦去死，眞是要死得割割裂裂了，古人謂「愛之欲其生，惡之欲其死」，現在反其道以行之，愛之欲其死，難道惡之反欲其生麽，眞是人心大變，大變人心。</p>
<p>戰國時，秦宣太后私魏醜夫，太后病將死，出令曰，爲我葬，必以魏子爲殉，魏子惠之，　　爲魏子說太后曰，以死者爲有知乎，太后曰，無知也，曰太后之神靈，明知死者之無知矣，何爲以生之所愛，葬於無知之死人哉，苦死者有知，先王積怒之日久矣，何暇乃私魏醜夫乎，太后乃止，這段事實，明明說旣是愛人，决不願白白裏要他送死，宣太后雖則妖淫，到此亦能覺悟。</p>
<p>就再激底地說，人生本來是空，死是總有一日，若一樣要死，則死的方法正多，如荊軻聶政之爲刺客，是一死法也，田横文天祥之不肯爲亡國奴，是亦一死法也，徐錫霖熊成基唐才常，以及黄花崗之七十二烈士爲革命而死，亦一死法也，如此次奮勇抗日之陣亡將士，及東北之義勇軍，亦一死法也，如美國人坐飛機八日而環行世界一周，現在又有人欲六日環行世界一周，亦一死法也，一樣犠牲一樣死，一種死得何等光明磊落，一種死得穢瑣齷齪，眞有泰山鴻毛之别。</p>
<p>人獨患貪生怕死，若不怕死，總有辦法，故犠牲原未始不可，總要値得，總要有意義，就是古來大英雄大豪傑，亦不過是不怕死，若僅僅爲了一個女子而死，無辦法而死，眞是　葺，眞是飯桶。</p>

<p>— 韻</p>
<p>「沼氣」自古就有人知道。從源邊和塘池裏可以取得。其法用竹棒將水底沉澱的淤泥攪亂，水面上就放出許多小氣泡。將這小氣泡用玻璃盃「倒接」得。提出此玻璃盃時。急用火向口面然燒。就發靑色的火熖。便是沼氣的燃燒。現在有應用代電燈和燃料的。名爲天然瓦斯燈。</p>
<p>沼氣的化學成分是炭輕四。化學子式ＣＨ４。實騐方法。用乾燥的醋酸鈉五克許。和以同量的輕養化鈉。及石灰末少許。入堅硬的試騐管中熱之。就發生這氣體。西名爲米脫痕（Methane）因其兩個分子皆是可煅　。故發生靑熖火力極强。尋常植物質在空氣不足處腐爛。也會發生這氣體。池塘底的淤泥。因爲他含有多量的腐敗植物。所以也會發生這氣體來。</p>
<p>現在利用他製天然瓦斯燈的方法。就是把植物質的菜葉米糠淘米水。牛糞等。密藏在不透空氣的地窖裏。上面加以淸水。經了一二星期。菜葉米糠等腐化。發生這沼氣。預用六棒攪動。使其氣由一鐵管通出。在這鐵管口。配置安全燈（就是紗罩燈）如煤氣燈似的燃燒起來。便可以代電燈。若改作約如打氣爐口的裝置。（與打氣爐不同的是一從一小氣管出氣。一從多數小氣管出氣）。則可以代打氣爐而爲燃料。</p>
<p>沼氣的燃燒。如不愼混合空氣。則必爆裂。所以這天然瓦斯燈的裝置。不是可以草率從事的。</p>
<p>經營是業的用水泥製的地窖。測定地窖的尺度。所用的植物質的廢物多少。計算能夠發沼氣量多少。並特製一種氣壓表以測定之。其燈頭的裝置。鐵管的裝置。皆經一度的研究而特製專賣。</p>
<p>菜葉淘米水等廢物。在鄕間甚多。城市取之不易。所以此種裝置。以鄕間爲宜。不過一次的裝設水泥地窖。和鐵管燈頭等費用甚巨。鄕間的平民又不容易設備。所以還不能爭勝電氣的力量。又此種裝置本無秘密之可言。亦不能專利。不過尋常想裝置者。至少要請一位有化學和工藝的常識人監督。不然會發生危險。或縱不危險。亦不經濟。不可不愼。</p>

<p>大馬路塞滿了人，也塞滿車：電車，馬車，人力車，小車，卡車，有白牌子的汽車，也有黑牌子的汽車。來的去的，横的直的，擠滿了，塞滿了。</p>
<p>忽然一輛黑牌子汽車停下來了，儼如害着急病似的，不能動顫，於是在後面的得跟着停住了，第一輛，第二輛，第三輛以至第……輛，都得停住都得停住。一時汽車在馬路上接成了一條死</p>

<p>的龍。電車也夾在中間不停的踏着鈴。</p>
<p>現在，害着急症的病車中有人下來了，那人穿着英國式的西裝，褲脚小到最低限度，黄皮鞋，硬草帽，還有那鼻子下面僅有兩指寬的鬍鬚，由於這些特點，我們立刻便會知道那是大帝國的臣民了。他怎麽樣呢？當然照例的檢查一次機件。可是這病車並不像他所希望的那樣容易診治，於是他慌張起來了。馬路是一刻也不能停滯的，在後面的喇叭和鈴聲簡直響個不住，於是印度阿三來了，看熱閙的人也圍着來了。當然我們的阿三只有搖搖頭，唯一的辦法只有帮着這位帝國臣民將這病車推向馬路旁邊去，以使被阻滯的車子得以通過。</p>
<p>然而這並不是最善的處置，即如汽車始終不能就此擺在馬路上而自已也來守着它的。無論如何得設法運它回去。最後他總算有了主意，他招呼着在街上閒散的人們，那種不純熟的上海話簡直使人肉麻。</p>
<p>「喂，你們來幾個人給我推回去好嗎？我給錢你們。」</p>
<p>但是並没有人回答他，誰都是望着他鄙視的一笑便走開了。然而爲了有錢終於有人詢問他：</p>
<p>「你給多少錢一個人呢？」</p>
<p>「到戈登路，兩毛錢一個人好嗎？」</p>
<p>「兩角錢？大馬路到戈登路？呸！」</p>
<p>「那末你說要多少呢？」</p>
<p>「五個人，頂少五塊錢一個，少一個銅板不幹！」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈！」大家發出一陣笑聲。</p>
<p>「ＸＸ人，壞傢伙，不要理他。」有誰這樣的說了。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈哈！」又是一陣笑聲。</p>
<p>人們偶然的在這裏得着一陣歡笑之後，不久便走開了。赤佬，殺中國人的，壞傢伙。誰理他呢？這也算是一種報復。</p>

<p>「高等仕女」，我根本夠不上，我只是個最低等的文丐，「消夏同樂」，夏是否必要消，樂又從那裏起？雪樣的一個銀餅，它威武地把持了村門，這資本主義者的消金地，這貧窮者的流落所。</p>
<p>是極熱的一個垂暮，雲跑來堅邀，我去一賞厥光，苦悶的我，貧乏的我，那裏來的錢？有什麽興趣去看？我回絶了，我說：高等仕女的同樂會，决計不是窮措大似我而可去的。</p>
<p>雲並不生氣，他說：去，一定去，那裏很有趣，並且有位和你同名的女士在着。</p>
<p>「同名，眞的？」</p>
<p>「誰騙你？」</p>
<p>好奇心一動，終於由雲出了「買路錢」進去了，「梁園雖好，不是久戀之家，」不知怎樣，貴人們駕臨之地，我們窮小子進去站在一起，總有點手足失措，所以我進去不多時，爲了豪氣所凌路了，</p>
<p>是的，碧水微波，小舟蕩漾，綠樹鬱葱，唯一消夏勝地，多麽熱閙啊？多麽高興啊？男男女女，一簇簇地眉花眼笑着，</p>
<p>雲是會舞的所以進門就到舞廰去，他說，ＸＸ先生和ＸＸ女士的Tango很精彩，不可不看，而和你同名的Miss，也可乘機一看，當然，我不跟他去，又何所適從呢？</p>
<p>舞廳我從没進過，這次廣了眼界。</p>
<p>男，從面部現着慾的男，女，妖形怪狀近乎赤裸的女，樓緊了拼命舞，光滑的地板，會使我立不穩，没有一個人不快活，消夏同樂大會是名符其實的，</p>

<p>我不認再看，於是我跑了，我只意識要想到這般人除非亡國後才覺悟，我深悔此行的不該，可是晚了。</p>

<p>在忙亂而又急迫的前擠的人羣中，這裏更顯示了「强」與「弱」。强者臉上常是掛着得意的笑，常是張大着吃有的血口。常是圓睜着貪婪的雙目，在等待着爭鬭的對手，在追逐着馴服的羔羊。弱者則無可奈何地宛轉掙扎，或是倒在黑暗的角落裏，偷食强者的殘餘。</p>
<p>電炬從各個建築物上發出各種各色的光，尤其那「紅色」特别剌人眼目。偉大的「紅」色那是血的象徵，是爭鬭的信號，火一般的植立在血和肉所砌成的南京路之最高峯，給予人類以偉大的啓示</p>
<p>嘈雜的聲音，隨着人流湧起，有笑聲，有哭聲，有哀號聲，同時也夾雜着怒吼聲。</p>
<p>在路隅，更有許多妖媚的眼在閃爍着，有許多塗了胭脂的唇在輕嘘着，顫動着的乳峯，搖擺着的肥臀，「來　來　」！這是誘惑的呌喊，也是生的呌喊，妖媚中夾着無限的哀怨與姜厲！</p>
<p>斜掛着殺人的手槍的巡捕站在十字路口的中央，伸長着兩手指揮車輛與人羣，顯然，這社會的秩序，是建築在武力之上。我想假使這武力有一天被另一羣人奪云……………。</p>
<p>夜深了「擁擠着的人羣都暫時休息，準備明日爭鬭角逐的氣力，馬路的兩旁殘剩着弱者的屍骸，廣長的路也從一天的疲乏中吐出一口深苦的氣。</p>

<h3 id="c209">新舊腦筋的衝突 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>在我對鄰鄭姓的老夫妻俩，是天生的一對好人，他有二個兒子，已經都結了婚。還有三個女兒，大的已經出嫁了，第二和第三女兒却還没有出閣，但是也已經過了破瓜之年了。</p>
<p>大兒子和大媳婦雖然祗有三十歲，可是一對時代潮流的退伍者，他俩最古怪的脾氣，是終日不歡喜開口。</p>
<p>然而；二女兒却是一個新腦筋的好動者，也讀過了幾年書，在每個星期日的公園中，總有她和她的情侶—未婚夫—逛著，而且她的未婚夫也天天到她家裏，他俩的愛情，可算達到沸點啊！</p>
<p>鄭老夫妻俩是天生的一對好人，所以由他的女兒自由行動著，倒是善於應順潮流啊！</p>
<p>可是；大兒子和大媳婦是一對時代的落伍者，當然；看見妹子這樣的行爲，很不贊成，有時提出了異議。</p>
<p>因爲腦筋新舊的不同，存了意見，發生了好幾次衝突，</p>
<p>記得有一次，爲了一些小故，已存意見的姑嫂二人口角起來，當然；在盛怒之下，大家都宣佈穢狀，　子和茶具做了她們的犠牲品，鄭老兒氣得話都說不出來，鄭老太剛巧有事回到嶺南家裏去了，所以閙了好一會兒的全武行，方纔給隔壁的一個孫老太太勸開，可是；看閙熱的人，已經擠滿了門口，從此把家醜傳了出來。</p>

<p>黑幕之事，常常有之，惟近年因生活程度日高，社會經濟的不景氣，因之有許多黑心的印度黑炭，利用此機會大開其黑幕—放債公司—聚集不　　徒，爲交際員·（即俗稱拉馬）在外廣招債户，因之缺少金錢者，聽得拉馬之甘言蜜語，往往加入債團，惟一經入轂，印度黑炭即使用其慣技手續，其方法只是欺騙借債人寫一張假筆據，照欵額多寫一二倍，（這是刻板的章程）寫利息一分或分半，其實按月要收八分，九分，在此時，借債人一半受着印度黑炭和拉馬的欺騙，一半受着經濟的壓迫，雖明知受欺，只得飮酖止渴，免强落筆，在相差半數之銀洋和借據，交換時，又將第一月之重利，光行扣去，拉馬强索鞋子錢多少，此外這個印度人，用債權人的資格，時常到債務人家裏去遊玩每每作種種不一的黑心狂欲，（如强姦，打人，駡人，索人子女，不給錢取人貨物，聲請加利等等）債務人如敢反對，當即反面，就向法院裏去謊告債務人本息不還，保人不理，并根據當時被欺騙無法而寫成的假筆據，作爲正當理由，請求法院追償，然而這時候的債務人，猶如病入膏肓，旣不能自救，又不能求救，正如病入膏肓，名醫亦束手無策·不亦寃乎·旣上其當者，已不必記，惟希未上其當者，請注意之。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Urgent News from Jehol <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Jehol Province, under the menacing gaze of a powerful enemy, has barely managed to survive. According to recent news, the Japanese warlord Shigeru Honjo has ordered Japanese troops from various locations to concentrate within Jehol Province, preparing for a large-scale offensive. He has proclaimed Jehol as the "security line for East Asian peace" as a pretext for invading Jehol. The peril faced by this remaining piece of land under the powerful enemy's large-scale attack is self-evident. If Jehol falls, a plan to attack Peiping and Tientsin could be launched simultaneously. This, combined with the recent Japanese declaration that war can resolve the world's economic panic, their purchase of large quantities of munitions, and their aggressive expansion of military preparations, confirms their readiness to invade North China and ignite a second or third Shanghai Incident. Japanese warlords have already publicly declared their intentions.</p>
<p>If Jehol is lost, Peiping and Tientsin will inevitably be shaken. If Peiping and Tientsin cannot be defended and the enemy is allowed to roam freely, our country will truly be reduced to seeking only partial peace, and even that will be unattainable. Therefore, our country has reached a critical juncture where survival and death will be decided.</p>
<p>In the past, our reliance on pleading and seeking help through diplomacy and policies of concession and appeasement has proven ineffective. Our government should now be fully aware of this. For ten months, we have failed to use force to reclaim lost territories or to formally dispatch troops to suppress the puppet state, allowing a powerful enemy to establish a puppet state and complete its invasion plan. Even if we concede, the enemy will still invade. The policy of non-resistance has only harmed ourselves. Yet, even now, some still advocate acquiescing to the facts created by the Japanese warlords, hoping to negotiate to curb their aggressive ambitions. How misguided is this plan?</p>
<p>To satisfy the ambitions of the Japanese warlords, they will not be satisfied until they devour our entire country. They invaded the Northeast, and we conceded the Northeast. They coveted Jehol, and we conceded Jehol. If they attack Peiping and Tientsin, and even the Yangtze River basin, where will the concessions end? It is better to die as a shattered jade than to live as a broken tile. Are we now ready to die as a shattered jade? If we seek to live as a broken tile but cannot, how will we face ourselves?</p>
<p>Therefore, we firmly advocate that we prepare to confront the invading enemy forces in Jehol head-on. At the same time, we must plan for the overall strategy of recovering lost territories and suppressing the puppet state, preparing to launch a broad national revolutionary war.</p>
<p>As for the current status of Peiping and Tientsin, it is extremely critical. Learning from the ease with which the Northeast was lost, the government must swiftly and decisively establish comprehensive defense plans for Peiping and Tientsin, and select responsible officials. We believe that the officials responsible for Peiping and Tientsin must be selected from among those who are energetic, responsible, and prioritize the life of the nation, to be stationed there. Those who are mediocre and weak, full of lethargy, seeking only temporary peace, and indulging in opium and revelry are not fit to speak of the country. Therefore, at this critical juncture, the government should have the final determination to rectify discipline, save North China, and avoid repeating past mistakes. A decisive action should be taken. The situation is urgent. Indecision will inevitably harm the country. The government must not acquiesce to the facts or act out of personal feelings, thereby plunging our country into an abyss of no return.</p>

<h3 id="e2">League of Nations Investigation Team Arrives in Qingdao <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>After a banquet at the Municipal Government last night, they departed west by train.</p>
<p>Lord Lytton is ill; Zhang Xueliang sends a plane to Jinan to meet him.</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The investigation team, consisting of twenty-four members, and twelve Japanese representatives, arrived in Qingdao at 1:20 PM on the 19th aboard the Chichibu Maru. Wellington Koo, Shen Honglie, Ge Guangting, and representatives from various sectors, totaling over a hundred people, welcomed them at the pier. The four commissioners from the United States, Germany, France, and Italy disembarked and stayed at the Governor's Mansion, while the others stayed at the Grand Hotel. Lord Lytton, suffering from neurasthenia, did not disembark with them but was transported to the British Consulate by the Lion's Club stretcher. At around 5 PM, reporters visited him and were received by the team's Secretary-General Haas. When asked about the team's impressions of their trip to Japan, Haas replied that due to an agreement with Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida to keep their discussions confidential, they did not make any announcements in Japan or in China. He added that the articles published in Japanese newspapers were merely speculations and that there was no need to correct them as the Japanese Foreign Ministry had stated that it had not released a single word. When asked where the report would be drafted, he replied in Peiping. When asked when it would be completed, he replied around the end of August. When asked if they would contact the central government again, he replied that they would decide on an ad-hoc basis if there was anything important. The group attended a banquet at the Municipal Government at 5 PM and departed west by special train at 6:35 PM. Wellington Koo added a flower car for the Jiaoji Railway. Lord Lytton was transported to the train by a hospital ambulance and then transferred to a plane in Jinan to go to Peiping. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) League of Nations Investigation Team's Chief Investigator Lord Lytton, suffering from a cold, will be admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital upon his arrival in Peiping. The Chichibu Maru, carrying the investigation team, arrived in Qingdao Harbor at 11:30 AM this morning. All investigators, except Lord Lytton, disembarked at 1:15 PM. Wellington Koo and others welcomed them on the ship. Lord Lytton was carried ashore on a stretcher and then transferred to a sick car to the British Consulate, where his secretary, Esoto, took care of everything. The investigators have already departed for Jinan tonight on a specially prepared train. Lord Lytton will stay there for a short time and then fly to Peiping on Wednesday morning aboard Zhang Xueliang's specially dispatched private plane to enter Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Zhang Xueliang received a radio message from the Chichibu Maru in the ocean, informing him of Lord Lytton's illness, and they agreed via telegram to send a plane to wait for him in Jinan. This office also received the ship's radio message reporting Lord Lytton's indisposition and prepared a sick car for use. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) News of Lord Lytton's illness has caused great concern here, as the Eastern climate is unsuitable, and the long journey is arduous, not to mention the difficulty of the task at hand. The Earl will be fifty-six years old on August 9th. It is inevitable that a man past his prime, bearing such a heavy responsibility, will suffer from mental and physical exhaustion. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang sent Yi Yage in a Ford plane to Jinan this morning to meet Lytton. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Haas telegraphed Peiping to borrow Zhang Xueliang's Ford plane to meet Lytton. Zhang agreed to send a plane to Jinan to meet him. (19th Dispatch)</p>

Lin told visitors that since the incidents in Northeast China and Shanghai, the international community is deeply concerned that world peace and justice may be completely destroyed and earnestly hopes for a fair solution to eliminate this future great disaster. In particular, the American government and public are extremely concerned about the Sino-Japanese dispute, believing that the severity of the situation is enough to affect the tranquility and happiness of all mankind. The task of my visit to China is to conduct a detailed investigation into all serious issues between China and Japan to contribute to the peace movement. I plan to go to Wuhan first on the 20th to meet with Jiang, then转to Mount Lu to visit Lin Sen, and spend several days there to escape the summer heat. After the autumn cools down, I will go to Peiping, and via the Northeast, go to Japan to investigate all situations so that after returning to China, I can create materials for just propaganda.

After investigation, our division has been stationed in Suzhou and has not moved so far. It is more than 800 miles away from Ganzhou by land and is the defense area of another division. No soldier has ever been to that place, so how could we extort the people of Ganzhou? This is the first point. Furthermore, the monthly expenses are all approved and telegraphed by the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance, and there are records to prove it. Not a single cent is taken by ourselves. This is the second point. Your newspaper bears the responsibility of social justice. Please do not easily believe hearsay, which would lead to black and white being reversed. Please correct it to clarify the truth, and it can also be questioned by the public opinion of local citizens.

<p>Britain, America, and France Agree on Three Principles</p>
<p>Limiting Armored Vehicles</p>
<p>Abolishing Chemical Warfare</p>
<p>Supervising Arms Manufacturing</p>
<p>Aviation Issues Still Under Debate</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 18th: After French Prime Minister Herriot held talks with representatives from Britain and the United States, the first stage of the Disarmament Conference was able to come to an end. All parties have agreed on the preamble to the resolution on the matter. This preamble contains two principles that France values most: (1) The reduction of land, sea, and air forces and the interlocking relationship of the three military arms; (2) The ability to aggress must be reduced. From today onwards, the Disarmament Conference has adopted the following three principles: (1) Limiting armored vehicles, (2) Abolishing chemical and bacteriological warfare, and warfare for the purpose of arson, and (3) Establishing a standing committee to supervise the manufacture of arms. However, the issue of aviation is still under debate. France is asking for (1) bombing planes to continue to be used on the battlefield, and (2) to ban civil aviation so that it cannot be used for military purposes. As for special sanctions for violations of the two bans on chemical warfare and aerial bombardment, it seems that Britain, America, and France have reached an agreement. The only remaining issues are the reduction of heavy artillery, the limitation of military quotas, and the restriction of military budgets, which remain unresolved.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 18th: French Prime Minister Herriot, accompanied by cabinet members Foncet, Pangaud, and Renoult, arrived in Geneva today and held lengthy talks with the US representative and the British representative to the Disarmament Conference. According to news from the US delegation, these talks were merely an exchange of views, but rumors outside say that it has been decided that in addition to the preamble guiding the report drafted by the Czech Foreign Minister, a maximum and minimum set of provisions will be drafted for each chapter. The General Committee to be held tomorrow or Wednesday will publicly discuss this proposal.</p>

<p>Ship Collides with Freighter</p>
<p>Fortunately Traveling Slowly and Undamaged</p>
<p>Havas, London, 18th: The British steamship "Empress of Britain," carrying the British, South African, and other national delegations to the Ottawa Conference to Canada, was steaming up the St. Lawrence River towards Quebec when it suddenly collided with a freighter weighing 4,000 tons. Fortunately, the "Empress of Britain" was traveling very slowly at the time due to fog on the river, and the crew was skilled in navigation, so although it suffered a violent jolt, the hull was not significantly damaged. The delegation had just experienced a false alarm due to a power failure last night and encountered this incident again today, which can be said to be extremely unfortunate.</p>
<p>Reuters, Quebec, 19th: The British steamship Empress arrived here last night and received a grand welcome. As soon as the ship entered the harbor, the horns sounded in unison, and the crowds on the shore lined up, cheering non-stop, almost emptying the streets. Canadian planes flew in the air, escorting the British delegation's ship. British representative Baldwin and others made short speeches, thanking the people of Quebec via radio broadcast. At 6:15 in the evening, the British representatives landed. The leader of the Indian delegation also spoke to thank the welcoming crowd.

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 19th: Denmark and Norway have long disputed the ownership of land in eastern Greenland without resolution. The case has now been submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Brief Overview of Greenland and Iceland <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Dispute Over Territorial Rights in the East Is Not Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>Because the Monarchs of Denmark and Norway Are Brothers</p>
<p>The dispute between Denmark and Norway over territorial rights in eastern Greenland has been submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for arbitration. The arbitration period is set for December. Observers speculate that this case will not cause major international disputes and will be easily resolved peacefully because the monarchs of Denmark and Norway are brothers. Greenland is an island in the Arctic Circle with an area of 838,000 square miles, which is nearly 50 times larger than the area of its home country, Denmark (16,604 square miles). Six-sevenths of the island's area is covered by ice, uninhabited, and almost impossible to set foot on. On its east coast, the extension of ice to the sea extends to 250 miles. The daily production of icebergs and smaller ice floes is 40 million tons. It has a population of 16,000. The island has seven radio stations, one newspaper, and a hospital sufficient to accommodate 250 patients. There are 69 concessions and commercial districts, and a total of 300 officials, pastors, and doctors. Only 2% of the island's population is literate. The island has 96 churches and schools, two of which are adult schools and one is a higher education institution, with approximately 2,000 students enrolled. Children from the ages of seven to fourteen are forced to attend school, and outstanding students are selected to be sent to Denmark for further education. Students in higher education institutions have recently organized an orchestra to engage in extracurricular entertainment. The Boy Scout movement has also taken root among young people. They receive regular training in gymnastics and various manual skills. Public health and public sanitation are of concern to the administrative authorities. The island has ten hospitals. The management of public health throughout the island is handled by eight Danish doctors, eight Danish nurses, and hundreds of other midwives. In terms of natural resources and trade</p>
<p>and trade conditions, the living conditions of the island's inhabitants are very favorable. Their way of life is fishing, hunting, and whaling, which causes the Danish government to expend a large amount of funds. Whale meat is a common food for the islanders. There is a coal mine in the northern part of the island that produces 5,000 tons of coal annually. A fox farm has recently been built, and sheep farming has been introduced to the south. There are currently about 6,000 sheep. Cod and halibut are major exports of the island. The islanders mostly operate commercial investments independently without relying on government assistance. Although all administrative affairs related to the island are concentrated in Copenhagen (the capital of Denmark), local autonomy on the island is also very developed. As in the mid-to-late 19th century, the Eskimo region had a local council organization, dividing the entire territory into thirteen districts and sixty-four villages. Each village is governed by a locally elected council. Each member of the council can represent each village and attend district meetings. In addition, there is a legislative council that performs judicial functions, composed of representatives from thirteen districts. The village council has full authority over village finances and administrative facilities. All islanders over the age of 55 who cannot support themselves are subsidized by the authorities with public debt to cover their living expenses. In addition, the natives of the island have a deep-seated attitude of exclusion towards foreigners, so those who want to visit the island can only enter secretly. (World News Agency)</p>

It is estimated that this project will cost 50 million pounds, and it is planned to dredge the upper reaches of the river to a depth of about 26 feet and build dams to protect it to facilitate the passage of large ships. It is also planned to set up a hydroelectric power plant that can produce 2 million horsepower of hydroelectric power. Part of this project, namely the expansion of the Welland Canal linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, has now been completed by Canada at a cost of 25 million pounds. This plan is of great benefit to the grain industry, and shipping costs are expected to be greatly reduced. The industry in the Midwest of the Americas will be greatly and positively impacted. President Hoover pointed out that this plan is the biggest internal improvement in North America. This treaty must be ratified by both countries before it can be implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Puppet Organization Forces Customs Officials to Return to Work <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Using Communist Charges as Leverage</p>
<p>Two Arrests of Chinese and Foreign Customs Officials</p>
<p>Extensive Search of Tax Commissioner Bert's Residence</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: Since the Binjiang Customs was forcibly taken over by the puppet state, the customs offices along the river have been operating. After the puppet state took over the Binjiang Customs headquarters and its branches, along with over two hundred and thirty Chinese and foreign customs officials and tax commissioners, it used violence to coerce a small number of Chinese customs officials to return to work. The remaining customs officials either disguised themselves and returned to the interior or sought refuge elsewhere. Because the customs officials had previously been issued three months' salary by the Ministry of Finance, those who left or suspended their duties did not have any issues with their livelihood. The remaining approximately sixty-two people who did not leave or seek refuge were staying in Tax Commissioner Bert's residence on Customs Street in Nangang. Although the puppet state appointed Yu Shaowu as the Customs Chief, he was merely a puppet. The real power was in the hands of the newly appointed puppet Deputy Customs Chiefs, Kitamura, Murai, Minami, and Kato, all of whom were Japanese. In name, these individuals only replaced the former Deputy Tax Commissioners, but in reality, their authority surpassed theirs. All personnel and administrative matters were in their hands. These four individuals were assigned to work in various customs offices. Of the customs officials they employed, seventy percent were Japanese, twenty percent were White Russians, and only ten percent were Chinese, including the old customs officials who were forced to continue working. Since the forced reopening of customs, daily revenue has only been one-fifth or two-fifths of the original amount. This is because the newly employed customs officials are either unfamiliar with the procedures or fail to notice loopholes. The Japanese in charge, such as Kitamura, also understand nothing and ask the old customs officials about everything. As a result, the handling of procedures is exceptionally slow. Foreign importers and exporters have been extremely dissatisfied for the past month. The American Consul Hansen visited the puppet Customs Superintendent Ba Ying'e to criticize him face-to-face regarding the additional taxes levied on a certain American trading company. The Japanese side is aware of its lack of experience, so it is doing its utmost to force the old customs officials to return to work. On the [blank] day of this month, four Russian customs officials and deputy tax commissioners were arrested, accused of being communists and having evidence of spreading communism. After the arrest, they were forced to sign a commitment to return to work. When they refused, they were imprisoned in the puppet administration office. On the morning of the ninth, the Nangang Tax Commissioner Bert's residence was surrounded again, and six Chinese former customs officials, including Ke and Zhang, and twelve foreign customs officials were arrested, all accused of being communists. At the same time, on the pretext of searching for evidence, Bert's residence was thoroughly searched. Although American Consul Hansen went to stop them, they ignored him. The customs officials arrested in these two incidents are still being detained. Currently, the only option for the old customs officials is to surrender immediately, sign the commitment, and resume work. If they try to sneak out of Harbin and flee to other places, it is almost impossible. This is because the Japanese have instructed the puppet military police to monitor them, and they have not yet been completely withdrawn. The puppet organization sent personnel to Tongjiang a month ago to take over the Lahasusu branch customs. They traveled to Yilan under the protection of the Japanese army. Upon reaching Fujin, they turned back midway because Li Du's army, led by Lu Yongcai, attacked Yilan. As a result, the branch customs in that area has not yet been taken over. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">After the Noulens Were Sent to the Hospital, Luo and Zheng Resumed Their Duties Immediately <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Noulens Resume Eating</p>
<p>Hospital Heavily Guarded</p>
<p>Minister of Justice and Administration Luo Wen'gan and Vice Minister Zheng Tianxi had previously requested to resign due to the numerous difficulties in handling the Noulens' case. Initially, Premier Wang earnestly persuaded them to stay, but they still did not resume their duties. Luo and Zheng also stated that their resignation was purely to uphold the dignity of the judiciary. If the law could not be upheld, they would definitely not resume their duties. Now that the Noulens were escorted to Gulou Hospital for diagnosis and treatment on the evening of the seventeenth by Song, Cai, and others, who guaranteed that they would be available whenever summoned, the hunger strike issue has come to an end. Therefore, on the morning of the eighteenth, at around ten o'clock, they went to the Ministry of Justice and Administration together to resume their duties and handle important official matters.</p>
<p>After the Jiangsu Higher Court signed the order to release the Noulens from the detention center on the evening of the seventeenth, it was initially planned to send them to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum for convalescence. However, because the renovation there was not yet completed and the facilities were inadequate, they were sent to Gulou Hospital instead, arriving at around ten o'clock. Noulen stayed in ward 261, and his wife stayed in ward 273. Dr. Ferant, an American doctor at the hospital, immediately diagnosed and treated them and gave them two liang of rice soup. On the eighteenth, both in the morning and afternoon, the hospital director, Dan Yier, and Dr. Ferant diagnosed them twice. Subsequently, they were fed every two hours, with liquid nutritious foods such as orange juice, lemonade, and rice soup. The amount of rice soup consumed by the Noulens on the eighteenth had increased to four liang. According to the doctor, their lives should not be in danger. On the same day, the Noulens also met with their relative, Feng Jie'en, at the hospital. However, Noulen's body appeared slightly weaker than his wife's.</p>
<p>After the Noulens were escorted to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment by Song and others, the court paid close attention to the surveillance and security after the Noulens were sent to the hospital, as they still had to conduct the trial according to the law after the Noulens recovered. Two police officers dispatched by the Capital Police Department guarded the gate of Gulou Hospital. Outside the Noulens' rooms, three bailiffs dispatched by the court and five military police officers dispatched by the Garrison Headquarters were on duty in shifts. According to the regulations of Gulou Hospital, visitors were only allowed to see patients from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM every day. However, those who wanted to visit the Noulens had to obtain permission from the court.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Labor Unrest in the Mining Areas of Shandong Province <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Strike in the Zibo Coal Region</p>
<p>Slowdown at the Zhongxing Company</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Recently, labor unrest has occurred in the coal mining areas of Zibo and Yiyuan counties in Shandong Province. The situation is described below:</p>
<p>The coal mining areas of Zibo and Boshan counties in eastern Shandong Province are well-known coal regions in Shandong Province. Currently, the Zichuan Luda Company, a Sino-Japanese joint venture, is the largest in scale. The rest are mostly mined by China, with over forty companies of various sizes and over fifty mines. The coal quality is best in Boshan's Heishan area, where it can be used to smelt iron. The coal quality in Zichuan is slightly inferior. Boshan is mostly separated by high mountains, and the mining fields are quite fragmented. The largest is no more than two thousand mu, which is not suitable for large-scale mining. Therefore, Germany and Japan abandoned it and established large-scale companies in the Dahuangdi area of Zichuan. The current Luda Company is nominally a Sino-Japanese joint venture, but in reality, it is operated solely by the Japanese. The mining fields in Boshan are mined by Chinese merchants, but the scale is not very large. The capital is at most two to three hundred thousand yuan, and at least tens of thousands of yuan. According to statistics, the output of each company is more than four thousand tons of coal per day, with the Luda Company producing two thousand tons. In total, more than six thousand tons are produced per day, and more than two million tons per year. In addition to supplying the Jiaoji Railway and various parts of eastern Shandong, most of it is exported from Qingdao and shipped to Shanghai for sale, followed by Hankou and Guangzhou. Occasionally, it is sold to Osaka and Yokohama in Japan, but the amount is very small.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai is the main sales market for Shandong coal, the price of coal in Shanghai has recently fallen. Because the cost of Shandong coal is relatively high, it cannot compete with Fushun, Kailuan, Zhongxing, etc., and sales have plummeted. The high price of Shandong coal is due to three reasons: high taxes, high transportation costs, and high wages. Among them, regarding wages, the wages of coal miners in the spring of last year were around one yuan and two jiao per person per shift (one day and night is one shift). In the autumn of last year, due to coal shortages in various places, the price of coal was quite high, and sales were brisk. In order to increase production, various companies raised wages and competed to hire workers. Therefore, wages rose to two yuan, and sometimes even more than two yuan.</p>
<p>In order to maintain business and compete with foreign coal, the mining industry association decided that starting from the seventh of this month, all companies would uniformly reduce wages by one-quarter. The previous wage of four yuan would be reduced to one yuan and five jiao, which would be used as the standard. It should not be too high or too low. The miners opposed this because it was related to their livelihood. From the seventh to the ninth, they went on strike one after another. In Zibo and Boshan counties, except for the Luda and Bodong companies, over ten thousand people went on strike. However, the machine departments of various companies still had to operate as usual, otherwise the mines would be flooded. Therefore, the companies still needed a portion of their expenses. In total, the daily loss was more than four thousand yuan. The workers' attitude was to insist on the previous wages. If it was reduced by one-tenth, they would resume work. Because most of the workers are casual laborers paid by the day, they have no organization in peacetime. After the strike, they scattered to their homes and watched each other, unable to unite at all. Currently, the companies are in contact with the labor unions. It is said that most of the workers have agreed to resume work, with wages reduced by one-quarter from the previous amount. It is also said that the labor and management sides have reached a compromise and signed a contract, but as of today (17th), work has not fully resumed.</p>
<p>Recently, labor unrest has also suddenly occurred at the Zhongxing Coal Mining Company in Zaozhuang, Yiyuan County, southern Shandong Province. The company has over ten thousand workers. At the end of June, the company only issued bonuses to those working "inside" and not to those working "outside," which caused dissatisfaction among the "outside" workers and led to issues such as increasing wages and reducing workload. The workers of each mine jointly went on strike on July 10. After mediation, work was temporarily resumed, and the demands raised by the workers were discussed: 1. Distribute bonuses, 2. Reduce workload, 3. Increase wages. It has been five or six days, and there have been no results. The total daily output of the more than four thousand miners who go down the mine to extract coal is usually 2.8 million kilograms, with an average of 700 kilograms per person per day. However, the workers have recently been slowing down, and the output has dropped sharply. The total daily output has been reduced to 2.36 million kilograms, with an average of 590 kilograms per person per day. Compared to the previous output, the daily reduction is 440,000 kilograms, causing great losses to the company. The Department of Industry has specially dispatched Gu Wenlin to Zaozhuang to investigate with Wang Jun, who was sent by the provincial government, and to mediate with Zhang Shucheng, the standing committee member and mine manager of the company. Li Shaoji, the standing committee member of the company, also went to Zaozhuang from Jinan with Qin Zhibu, the Zhongxing supervisor specially dispatched by the Ministry of Industry, to inspect the situation. According to Qin Zhibu, the issue of labor unrest at Zhongxing Coal Mine is roughly as follows: Zhongxing's coal has a wide sales market. In addition to the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways using it completely, the Nanjing-Shanghai and Pinghan Railways also use it. Shanghai alone can sell 400,000 tons per year. Recently, Japan's Fushun coal has been competing fiercely. That coal sells for only ten yuan per ton in Shanghai and only twelve yuan in Hankou. This is because Fushun coal is mined in a large open-pit style. Trains enter the mine directly to load coal, which saves a lot on transportation costs. The Japanese government is also providing assistance to expand its sales in China in order to overwhelm other mines. Zhongxing coal sells for eighteen yuan per ton in Shanghai. Although Zhongxing coal has a stronger firepower and two tons can抵撫順 coal three tons, the calculated result is still too expensive. It has now been decided to reduce the sales price to sixteen yuan per ton. The same struggle is being waged in Hankou. Unexpectedly, at this time of fierce competition with Japanese coal, labor unrest suddenly occurred at Zhongxing Coal Mine. Although it is a slowdown rather than a strike, the company has suffered heavy losses in recent days. According to reports, Zhongxing's capital was originally 7.5 million yuan. There are more than ten thousand employees. Because the quality of the coal produced is excellent, the business is booming, and the assets have reached more than ten million yuan. During the Northern Expedition of the Party Army in the seventeenth year, it was once confiscated by the Party Army to serve as military expenses. 1 million yuan was used for each purpose before it was returned. In recent years, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has owed coal debts of up to 2 million yuan. This tangible loss has reached 4 million yuan. In addition, in recent years, Japanese Fushun coal has been competing for sales in Shanghai and Hankou at low prices. After the Shanghai war, sales in Shanghai have become even worse, causing the company to spend seventy to eighty thousand yuan more per month than it earns, relying solely on borrowing to make ends meet. Employee salaries have already been reduced. If the labor unrest continues and is not resolved, it will be even more difficult to sustain. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Recent Administration in Shantou City <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Report by Mayor Zhai Junqian</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Mayor Zhai Junqian of Shantou has been in office for two months. His efforts in promoting municipal administration, such as the construction of roads, the advancement of autonomy, the public bidding and management of taxes, the prevention of cholera, the firm and prudent handling of diplomatic affairs, the elimination of past malpractices, and the endeavor for all constructions, have been deeply appreciated by the citizens. On the eleventh of this month, Mayor Zhai reported on the recent administration of Shantou City during the memorial week. A summary is recorded below to show a glimpse. Mayor Zhai reported: (A) Finance Department: (1) Managing taxes and implementing open bidding, such as the sand and gravel tax, which has been scheduled for public bidding. (2) Urging the collection of aviation shares. As of the eighth, a total of more than 163,000 yuan had been collected. Personnel will be dispatched again to supervise and urge collection. As of the eighth, more than 79,000 yuan had also been collected in national defense public bonds. However, the difference is quite large, and the department has been ordered to earnestly urge collection. The government's expenses are paid 90% across the board, and penalty rules have been established for merchants who delay paying taxes in order to prevent delays. (B) Public Works Department: (1) Projects under construction include Fuping and Guoping roads. Those about to be constructed include Shanpai Road, Zhongshan Road, Shengping Road, Ruiping Road, the municipal hospital, and the municipal library. (2) Regulating the location of telephone and electric light lines on the road to facilitate traffic and improve aesthetics. (C) Health Department: (1) Printing and distributing cholera explanations, posting epidemic prevention slogans to make citizens understand prevention methods, and organizing vaccination teams to go to various districts to provide free vaccinations for citizens. (2) Banning the sale of raw fruits and cold drinks to prevent the spread of cholera, improving toilets, and ordering the dung bucket donation company to pay attention to cleanliness and use lime for disinfection to prevent transmission. (D) Social Affairs Department: (1) In diplomatic terms, the case of Xu Chengkun, a worker injured by the Norwegian Hai Xing wheel, and the case of Li Rong, a citizen injured by French expatriate Famo, were both important cases that former incumbent Huang had been unable to resolve for a long time. They have now been submitted for negotiation and have been resolved by the consuls of those countries paying for medical expenses, which can be called a satisfactory result. Furthermore, the British Consulate stated in a letter that the Asia Company had two hundred boxes of kerosene transported to Huanggang, which were detained by the 20th Regiment of the Seventh Division. This government immediately investigated in detail and found that the company had two violations: 1. Not hiring ships marked by the Chao-Hai branch. 2. Not reporting the Chao-Hai branch for issuing a pass. Since the company had violated the law, a letter was sent to refute it. All of these matters have been handled carefully. 3. In terms of social affairs, the cases of removing signboards that obstruct observation, handling the dispute over the public dispatch collected by the Shantou Seafood Guild, mediating the dispute over the butchery guild in the Third Market, and various labor-management dispute cases have all been resolved quickly. Furthermore, the false driver's licenses issued by former incumbent Huang without the city government seal are now being re-examined for the sake of caution in order to prevent abuses. Other activities, such as preparing for the opening of the asylum, investigating the situation of various news agencies, reviewing the interest rates of pawnshops, and banning newspapers that promote reactionary and obscene texts, are all being actively carried out. (E) Education Department: (1) In terms of school education, education in Shantou City is becoming increasingly developed. The number of classes in primary schools is also gradually increasing, and the number of primary school teachers also needs to be increased. In order to rectify education, primary school teachers are carefully reviewed, and primary school teacher registration is specially held. The equipment of the former industrial supplementary school is simple. It has now been decided to change it to a vocational school starting from the 21st year in order to cultivate technical talents. At the same time, the graduation period of the nanny school will be changed to three years in order to further study. (2) In terms of social education, newsstands will be added, people's night schools will be rectified, literacy campaigns will be promoted, slide shows and book propaganda will be conducted, the general situation of out-of-school children will be investigated, and the qualifications of teachers in people's schools will be reviewed to ensure that education is universal and knowledge is improved. (F) Autonomy Office: It had previously ordered the preparatory committees of each district to establish the preparatory committees of each neighborhood within ten days of receiving the document. The preparatory committees of each neighborhood were sworn in and started working on the third, checking the population in order to conduct citizen registration.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Brief Letter from Hangzhou <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Mint has suspended minting until now for more than half a year. The director, Zhou Peizhen, had been ordered by the ministry to handle the conclusion, and the ministry sent personnel to take custody. All employees were allowed to be paid two months' wages and dismissed. It was originally planned to conclude the order on July 1. Later, all employees surrounded and asked to withdraw the order, so as to maintain their livelihoods, and claimed that they were willing to wait without pay when there was no money. Zhou specially reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance and requested to be exempted from dismissal. On the 11th, he received an order to approve it.</p>
<p>The four provisional measures for the collection of business tax and the business tax regulations in Zhejiang Province have been revised and promulgated. Zhou Junyan, the director of the Department of Finance, specially summoned the directors of the first, second, third, and other nine districts of the business tax collection bureau to the province the other day to discuss the reorganization of tax revenue matters. The directors of the districts have arrived in Hangzhou one after another. The department has scheduled a meeting at the department at 7:30 AM on the 20th to discuss the methods to be carried out in order to levy taxes as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Director Feng of the Two Zhejiang Salt Affairs Audit Branch, in order to save expenses, submitted a memorial to the head office to allow the Ningbo Audit Branch and the police of each bureau and field to be abolished. The branch has now been closed and handed over to Wei Hongmo, the director of the Daishan Yuyao Two Scales Release Bureau, and others to take over. A total of more than four hundred police officers from each bureau and field in the three prefectures of Ning, Wen, and Tai will be paid two months' salary at the end of this month and dismissed across the board.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Pingtiao Bureau opened on the 20th of last month and established six factories. The original price of rice was set at nine and five tenths of a cent per liter. Later, because it was almost equal to the price of plain rice sold in the market, the price was reduced by five tenths of a cent per liter. Now, because each factory sells at most ten shi of rice per day, which is less than three tenths of the previous year, the price has been reduced again, and it is sold for eight cents per liter. It is said that the original date of opening was set for three months, and it is planned to end it one month earlier. (19th)</p>

<p>Accident Involving Wuxi-Chengjiang Long-Distance Bus. The Wuxi-Chengjiang Long-Distance Bus Company, founded by Wuxi locals like Feng Xiaozhong and managed by Sun Chenchu, has seen unprecedented success in its two years of operation. However, the company's management has been lacking, leading to repeated incidents. On the afternoon of the 18th, at 1 PM, the company's bus number six, driven by Yang Amao, was traveling from Chengjiang to Wuxi. When it reached the first iron bridge near the Beikou area in the county, the vehicle, overloaded and exceeding the speed limit, and with the driver operating single-handedly, became unstable. It swerved off the road and crashed into a nearby creek. A villager walking along the road was struck and killed instantly. All thirty-plus passengers were thrown from the vehicle, resulting in twelve injuries, all with head wounds and blood. The scene was horrific. Xue Lubei sustained the most severe injuries, including a testicular rupture, and his life is in danger. Other passengers are also in critical condition and have been sent to Tongren, Puren, and Mingde hospitals for treatment. The driver, Yang Amao, fled the scene. The Public Security Bureau and the Construction Bureau have dispatched personnel to investigate the incident.</p>
<p>Collision Between "Xinminfeng" Steamer and Coal Boat. Near Xin'an Township, about half a *li* from Xin'an Town in the 13th district of the county, a Shanghai Yitaixing coal boat, carrying 55 tons of coal to Yitaixing in Wuxi, was struck by the "Xintongfeng" steamer en route from Wuxi to Shanghai. The collision created a hole in the coal boat, causing it to sink rapidly. Of the six barges being towed by the steamer, three also sustained severe damage. Yu Zhuang, the coal boat captain, immediately directed his crew to seize the "Xintongfeng" steamer, preventing its departure. He also reported the incident to Meng Jiwu, patrol leader number eight, and Wang Yunjiang, patrol leader number nine, of the third group of the water patrol stationed there, who arrived to mediate. Wu Awen, the steamer's chief mate, argued that the coal boat failed to display proper lights and was improperly positioned, leading to the collision. He further asserted that the coal boat should compensate for the damage to the steamer's barges. The dispute remained unresolved. The coal boat captain traveled to Shanghai yesterday to consult with the Yitaixing Coal Company. Patrol leaders Meng and Wang, recognizing the severity of the ship collision and the significant losses involved, prepared a report detailing the incident and submitted it to the brigade headquarters for review.</p>

<p>Dispute Over Education Funds Deposited as Collateral. Educational public funds in Nantong are deposited with merchants as collateral to generate interest. A fierce dispute has arisen between the education bureau and the merchants over the conversion rate between cash and silver dollars. Recently, the education bureau petitioned the county government, requesting prompt settlement based on the Judicial Yuan's interpretation, which stipulates that the silver dollar value should be based on the market price at the time of deposit. The merchants, however, argued that there were precedents in other counties of the province for resolving cash and silver dollar issues and were unwilling to accept the losses. The resolution remains uncertain.</p>
<p>County Government Reviews Case of Bandit Leader from Tong and Rugao. On the 18th, the Nantong County government reviewed the case of Feng Chensi, a bandit leader from Tong and Rugao. Feng's mother, Feng Jinshi, who had appealed to the provincial government, was also summoned for questioning.

<p>Another Highway Robbery in the City. Yao Yiquan, residing in Huitong, was robbed of 300 silver dollars by thugs last month, and the case remains unsolved. Yesterday afternoon (the 17th), Gu Zhizheng, who runs a scissors shop in the west of the county, had collected 50 silver dollars. While passing through Dongshijie Street inside the North Temple, he was attacked by six thugs who beat him severely and made off with all the money. Gu fought back, managing to grab one of the robbers. The other thugs pulled out knives, and Gu cried for help. Hearing the commotion, local residents rushed to the scene, causing the thugs to scatter. The apprehended robber was handed over to the Public Security Bureau, where clerk Yang interrogated him. The robber identified himself as Liu Chenglong, a former member of the anti-smuggling patrol, claiming he was acting on someone else's orders. He has been transferred to the county government for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Police Assault Women. A man surnamed Zheng, a native of Pinghu, serves in the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. A few days ago, he returned to Pinghu from Shanghai and stayed at an inn in the east gate. The previous evening, Zheng took his wife out of the city, but the guards refused to open the gate, leading to a confrontation. Bystanders, feeling the injustice, slapped the guard twice. As a result, all were taken to the County Public Security Bureau. After questioning by Chief Huang, they were lightly reprimanded and released. Unexpectedly, upon returning to the entrance of Sangyuan Alley, they were attacked by several thugs, two of whom were wearing police uniforms. They were beaten severely, and knives were drawn. Zheng sustained multiple bruises, and his wife suffered three knife wounds to the head, causing serious injuries. The incident occurred at midnight, and Zheng frantically blew his whistle for help. Merchants in the east gate area, thinking there was a fire, rushed out in alarm. Outraged, they helped the injured couple to the Public Security Bureau to file a complaint and jointly submitted a petition requesting a thorough investigation and severe punishment as a deterrent to those who disregard the law.</p>

<p>Husband Takes Concubine, Mother and Daughter Commit Suicide. Yu Zhangshi, a woman from Daqingli, Shangsi Township, Hang County, was married to Yu Hongsheng, who worked for the Taikoo Insurance Company in Shanghai, in 1920. They shared a strong bond and had a daughter, Yindi, who is now eight years old. This spring, Yu took Jin Su'e, a woman from Wuxi, as a concubine in Shanghai and brought her home to live with his wife last month. Because Jin was young and beautiful, Yu treated her with exceptional affection, neglecting Zhang. Consumed by resentment, Zhang secretly bought one silver dollar's worth of opium a few days ago. On the morning of the 16th, she and her beloved daughter each consumed half of it, lying down in bed to await death. At noon, a neighbor visited and, upon entering the room and discovering their condition, realized they had taken poison. They were rushed to Jianggan Liuhe Hospital for treatment, but their lives are in jeopardy. The husband and concubine fled without a trace after the incident.</p>
<p>Verdict in Daughter's Death Case. Huang Long, a police officer from Tangqi Public Security Bureau, struck his nine-year-old daughter, A'yu, because she had eaten peaches sent by a neighbor. Instigated by his stepmother, Huang became enraged and dragged and beat his daughter, striking her head with a wooden stick, causing a fatal injury to her temple. The case was transferred to the Hangzhou District Court for investigation. He was prosecuted for causing death by assault. Yesterday (the 18th), after questioning by judge Chen Luzhi of the criminal court, the court ruled that while Wang had the intention to harm, he did not intend to kill his own daughter, which was a mitigating factor. His sentence was reduced by one-half, and he was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Hubei Refugees Escorted Out of Hangzhou. On the 16th, a large group of over 200 Hubei refugees arrived in Hangzhou from Xiaoshan, seeking to reside in the city.

<p>How Should Students Utilize Their Summer Vacation? By Liu Zhan'en.</p>
<p>The summer vacation is approaching, and schools nationwide are preparing to close and conclude the academic year. However, judging from past experiences, the majority of students tend to indulge in unrestricted play and unrestrained appetites during the summer vacation, leading to fatigue, illness, and a failure to grasp the meaning of the summer vacation and make good use of it.</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, students should still cherish their time, strive for moral development, cultivate and train their bodies, and engage with society and research. Subjects that cannot be researched during normal times should be pursued during this vacation. Students should not spend their days in idleness and indulgence, engaging in useless or harmful activities.</p>
<p>This year's summer vacation presents a different environment from previous years. Domestically, the flood disaster has not yet been recovered from, and externally, there is the pressure of powerful enemies. The landscape of the Northeast has changed color, and the scars of Shanghai are still fresh. At this critical moment of national crisis, students, as the backbone of the country's future, must work diligently, actively seek knowledge, and cultivate the strength to fight. They have no time for vacation. Therefore, in addition to ordinary summer vacation activities, they should utilize the summer vacation to engage in national salvation efforts, such as (1) implementing mass education, (2) promoting domestic goods, (3) participating in social improvement initiatives, and (4) advocating for the cessation of internal wars and the vigorous construction of a united front against foreign enemies. These are all areas where they can exert their efforts.</p>
<p>Currently, the *Shen Bao* is sponsoring an essay contest with prizes to guide students in utilizing their summer vacation. The topics emphasize practice, and students of all levels, from elementary to university, are eligible to participate. This method of encouraging young people has significant educational implications. It is hoped that school authorities and parents nationwide will encourage their children to participate so that young people across the country can understand the utilization of the summer vacation.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Details of Western Teacher Beating Students at Huatong Public School. <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Poor Tea Snacks Lead to Physical Assault. On the 13th of this month, students of the Huatong Public School, established by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession, requested newspapers to reveal the news of Mr. Auslice, the Western teacher, and Moffst, the principal, kicking and beating Hong Zuxiu, a student in the second grade of junior high school, and He Shengchang, a student in the third grade of middle school. Later, a reporter visited someone who had worked at the school, who said that every year as the summer vacation approached, the school held an academic exhibition and invited parents to a tea party. After the tea snacks, the principal would give a speech. The snacks prepared in previous years were palatable, but this year it was the opposite. Parents and students received only a paper bag of snacks containing a few pieces of coarse biscuits and cheap bread. The students were quite dissatisfied and blew up the paper bags of snacks into empty bags, making a popping sound. As a result, paper scraps flew everywhere. The Western teacher, Auslice, saw this and disliked it, ordering the students to pick them up and put them in the dustpan. Hong Zuxiu, a second-year student, stated that it was not his doing and explained the reason to the Western teacher, saying, "Why force people to do tea servant work?" Who knew that the teacher would kick and beat Hong before he finished speaking.</p>
<p>Picking Up Paper Scraps Repeatedly Evolves into Physical Altercation. After the kicking and beating, the Western teacher still wanted Hong to obey. Hong had no choice but to bow his head and pick up the paper scraps, placing them in the dustpan. The Western teacher repeatedly forced him to pick them up again and again. Hong could no longer endure it and threw the collected paper pieces back on the ground. The Western teacher considered this act an insult to a teacher and dragged and beat Hong to the faculty room and confined him, imposing a heavy punishment. As a result, two to three hundred students felt injustice, believing that the day of the parents' meeting should be a joyous day. Unexpectedly, the Western teacher acted so wildly, treating the students worse than servants. The students immediately elected He Shengchang, a third-year student, as their representative to negotiate with the principal for his release.</p>
<p>Principal Angered, Slaps Student Representative. During the conversation between the student representative He Shengchang and the principal, there was some misunderstanding in the language. During the speech, He Shengchang said, "Auslice is too uncivilized." The principal, upon hearing the word "uncivilized," became enraged and slapped He Shengchang's cheek three or four times, causing his lips, teeth, and tongue to collide, resulting in injury and bleeding in his mouth. At that time, more than a hundred family members of the students were still waiting quietly at the school for news. The students requested that the parents reason with the principal, but in the end, the principal was too prejudiced and could not be persuaded. The enthusiastic parents' meeting ended unhappily. Each parent came with excitement and left in disappointment.</p>
<p>Tearing Up the Northeast Map. It is also true that the principal tore up the Northeast map and the table of lost territories over the years. On the 13th, when the parents' meeting was held, the students' achievements were also displayed. A map of the three northeastern provinces and a table of lost territories over the years, made under the supervision of the Chinese teachers, were torn up by the principal. The Chinese teachers questioned this, and the principal apologized verbally for the loss of the map. The students were extremely angry and immediately posted anti-Japanese slogans. If they were torn up again, they planned to post slogans such as "Down with Imperialism" all over the school. Fortunately, the Western teachers were not familiar with Chinese and avoided a disturbance. However, the students were not happy, feeling that this was intolerable. The students of the school run by the Municipal Council, who had always been willing to obey, suddenly refused to pick up the pieces of paper, and there was a reason for it.</p>
<p>This is What the Head of Chinese and Western Education Said. On the 14th, the reporter visited Chen Heqin, the head of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council. He said that he had not fully understood the Huatong Public School incident and had only learned some of the situation from the newspapers. The reporter then went to visit Mr. Hiller, the head of the Education Department of the Municipal Council, but Hiller had taken leave to return to his country. Mr. Komp, the former principal of Huatong Public School, was now acting as his replacement. The reporter visited under the name of an individual, but Komp was out. The next day (the 15th), the reporter inquired about the Huatong Public School incident by telephone, and he said that the Western teachers hated the students' disobedience, which led to the beating of the students. The school had begun its summer vacation on the 15th, and the school was very peaceful and there was nothing happening.</p>
<p>Male Teacher Had Not Finished Beating, Female Teacher Also Beat. The reporter went to Fanhuangdu again and met Ou Kui'an, a member of the Education Committee of the Municipal Council. Ou expressed surprise at this matter. He said that he himself was investigating the facts. On the 17th, the reporter went to Penglu and met He Zusheng, the student who was beaten. He said much the same as someone from the school's administration. He added that on that day, students had gathered on the lawn. The school authorities sent several Western teachers to guard the main routes in front of the principal's office, preventing the students from passing through. However, the lavatories had to be accessed by going past the principal's office. A student who was in urgent need of urination was blocked. He was beaten by Miss Moore, a Western teacher.</p>
<p>Students Request Assistance from Taxpayers' Association. Huatong Public School is now on holiday. After being beaten, the students requested assistance from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association.</p>

<p>Today at 5 PM.</p>
<p>At the China Tennis Courts.</p>
<p>In the Lawn Tennis League, the Chinese Tennis Association has fought five matches. Except for the unfortunate 7-8 loss to the Flag Township General Assembly, it has won all the rest. With losses redeemed, the cry for winning is still very high. A total of 75 sets have been played, winning 57 and losing only 18. Judging from this score, the future is promising.</p>
<p>The Chinese Association has two remaining matches, one against Portugal and one against the Japan Tennis Association. These two teams are the strongest and the biggest enemies of China. The victory or defeat is the key to the championship. China will meet Portugal today at the China Association court. Next Wednesday, the China Association will meet the Japan Tennis Association at the Japanese Garden on Dongtiyuhui Road.</p>
<p>The Portuguese team has average talent and extraordinary strength. It has not been defeated since the start of the competition. Its first group of players is the doubles star Cana Vanero and the Caito. The second group is Coraxa and Ma[blank]er. The second group defeated Cx's Whitte and Wilson three to zero.</p>
<p>The Chinese Association's lineup today will be based on averaging out strength. The second group is especially strained. If Jiang Daozhang and Yu Tianguang are still used, I am afraid they will not be able to do the job. For prudence, the Chinese Association has notified the following players to gather at the tennis court before 4:30 PM to discuss enemy tactics. The competition will begin at 5 PM.

<p>Talk by Marathon King Nurmi</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Los Angeles, 18th) World marathon king, Finnish Paavo Nurmi, showed his brave figure at 3 p.m. today at the Olympic indoor stadium and immediately began practicing. After a short 30-minute break, a Dentsu reporter asked him, "How will the competition be this year?" He replied, "Normal. But I plan to shorten the record even more than the previous Amsterdam Games, but this is only regarding the marathon." (Question) "Does what you just said mean you have a very good chance of winning?" (Answer) "That is another question. Your country's Tsuda and Kwon Kim are formidable rivals. Argentina's Zabala and Germany's Teplow, like newly emerging comets, should not be underestimated." (Question) "Although the world expects it, we still believe you can win the championship." (Answer) "I will work hard. I also wish your country's athletes good luck."</p>
<h3 id="e113">American Newspaper Predicts Japan May Rank Third <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>(Dentsu, Los Angeles, 18th) With only ten days left until the start of the Games, Japanese track and field athletes are training more intensely. Track and field stars Oda, Nambu, Yoshioka, Nishida, etc., have adapted to the foreign environment, and new records are gradually appearing. However, the Japanese coaching staff has not released the daily records due to strategic considerations. Detectives from various countries are constantly lurking, specifically seeking information. Sports reporters from American newspapers are also detectives. They secretly watched Yoshioka's 10.4-second 100-meter practice time with astonishment, saying he is as strong as [illegible]. American newspapers published prediction articles stating that Japan may rank third in the Games. Japanese head coach Yamamoto recognizes this criticism as a public assessment.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Second Batch of Japanese Athletes Arrive in Los Angeles <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Dentsu, Los Angeles, 18th. The Taiyo Maru, carrying the second batch of Japanese athletes sent to attend the Olympics, arrived at San Pedro at 10 a.m. today. Olympic officials and Japanese people in Los Angeles gave a special welcome. The ship raised the Japanese flag and sailed to the harbor to greet them. After disembarking, the athletes boarded dozens of cars, with a music band car leading the procession for more than 30 miles, accompanied by welcoming Japanese people. They arrived in Los Angeles at 11 a.m. There, they were welcomed everywhere. In particular, the Japanese female athletes attracted the attention of the people of Los Angeles. The athletes then went to Los Angeles City Hall for a welcome reception before parading through the Japanese quarter. The female athletes went to the Chapman Park Hotel, while the male athletes went to the Olympic Village.</p>
<h3 id="e115">On School Physical Education (II) Lu Xiangqian <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>(3) Training Overly Emphasizes Athletes, Opportunities Are Not Equal. A school's physical education director or teacher, today, who painstakingly seeks to popularize physical education throughout the school, or train in health methods, is not only dismissed as [illegible] by ordinary people, but even students will regard them as mediocre and incompetent. Most people view physical education directors and teachers only as those who can connect with athletes, or lead athletes to expeditions to certain places at certain times, as their supreme authority. Physical education directors or teachers only say, "So-and-so is a national sprint champion, so-and-so is a soccer star and basketball player. In such-and-such year, month, and day, I led them to participate in a certain competition and win a certain championship. All of this was developed through my training, and they are all my talented students." They are invariably proud, as if overwhelmed with glory. They do not know that driving people to fight, creating a lack of specialization in studies, and the pain of having nowhere to turn after graduation are all caused by these so-called directors and professors. Furthermore, considering the many students who gradually develop hunchbacks or even die young from lung disease due to the lack of appropriate physical training and sports opportunities, it is not enough. As a physical education director or teacher, do they not recognize this as their responsibility, and do they not feel ashamed and guilty? Over the years, seeing the overemphasis on training by general school physical education directors and teachers, and the inequality of sports and health opportunities for most people, I deeply regret it. In the future, I hope that those who are directors or teachers, as well as athletes and non-athletes, should all have a deep understanding and clarity of their own rights and obligations. Then, it will be close to the ideal. (Athlete sports are not inappropriate to promote, but should not become a special class.)</p>
<p>(4) Advocating Mass Sports Requires Popularization Among the Common People. The failure of school authorities and those in charge of sports administration to advocate physical education has already been discussed above. Now, at a time when the country is in trouble and the economy is declining, it is especially important to adapt to the times and advocate for the whole country, striving for popularization and accessibility to the common people, so that most people can get physical training and health opportunities. Schools are the starting point. From schools, it should be extended to society, so that all our people, regardless of gender, age, get physical and health training. Then the nation can be strong, and national humiliation can be wiped out. Looking at the errors in past methods of promoting school physical education, the failure to enable the masses to share exercise opportunities is indeed a major cause of today's national weakness. However, most of those who advocate school physical education are still stuck in the imitation of accumulated habits, believing that having a large soccer field, a vast cinder track, and well-equipped tennis courts, as well as foreign sports equipment costing dozens of gold coins, is sufficient to promote physical education. This erroneous concept is a major obstacle to physical education. Today's schools, not only do general students think this way, but also general trendy physical education directors or teachers think this way. Ask the schools across the country, how many have such economic capacity and equipment? Even if they do, ask Shanghai after the January 28th Incident, once the schools themselves are reduced to war zones, most schools plan to relocate, taking classes in narrow alleys and small rooms. Ask yourself, under these circumstances, with the place already feeling small and the economy feeling difficult, as a physical education director or teacher, can you still rely on spacious fields and large buildings, holding volleyballs and basketballs to take the stage and implement your physical education policy? Or should you think of remedial measures, adapt to the environment, and work harder to promote it, not being bound by the current situation? This is a strategy and plan that should be planned by physical education directors or teachers in schools that have been reduced to war zones, as well as those who are preparing for unexpected disasters in the future. In my opinion, those responsible for physical education should usually advocate physical education that is popular and accessible to students. Popularization means not necessarily having a large sports field and perfect and expensive equipment, while still being able to get sports and exercise opportunities. That is, being able to exercise the body and improve health anytime, anywhere, which is conducive to the environment and a method of promotion that is not influenced by the environment. Accessibility means that everyone can get easy and simple sports opportunities and methods, not being困by the economy, and not being limited by techniques. By promoting school physical education in this way, and extending it to social physical education, it will be easy, simple, and most universal. (The End)</p>

<p>Ticket Revenue from the Previous Games. The ninth World Olympic Games in Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1928, had ticket revenue of more than 10 million Dutch guilders. However, the previous games had soccer competitions, and the ticket revenue from soccer was considerable, totaling more than 5 million yuan.

<h3 id="e117">Gold Market Slightly Higher <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold price continued to rise slightly, increasing by 3 liang and 3 qian, but the state was average, totaling a difference of 3 liang and 7 qian for the day. There were no large transactions by any firms. In the end, it rose more than 3 liang again. Initially, the price of silver bars was reported to have fallen, so the opening price was high. Although there were ups and downs afterward, it remained around 751 liang for the longest time, probably because there were no special changes in foreign exchange. Later, the market seemed firm, but the premium was only slightly more than one liang. Later, it was calculated to be about 53 liang. In August, 400 to 500 bars were dropped, and the shorts still paid out 2 liang and 2 qian. Now, Wing Fung, Hang Seng, Dalian Bang, Tai Cheong, and others are swapping. However, major clients still have not swapped all of the 11,000+ bars. The full-day situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>No major fluctuations in the morning. The September opening was at 750 liang, plus 5 qian. Next was 52 liang, because large bars fell another 1/16. Bank of America did not change, private telegrams had already fallen 1/8, so people's hearts were rising. However, Da De Cheng, Hang Shun, Li, and others were selling, so it immediately fell to 50 liang and 6 qian. Soon, Yuhe, Hongkang, Yongyuan Mao, Yongyuan Xing, Yong, and goods hedging came on the scene and entered. Also, British and Japanese banks mutually traded September British gold at 18,125, so the gold price rose more than 2 liang, with fluctuations of several qian. At 9:18, it was 53 liang and 2 qian. At that time, Tong Tai Cheong and others sold. HSBC then offered November British gold at 25, and US dollars for October could be settled at 875. When the British gold was announced, it was 51 liang and 3 qian, and the listed price was the same as before, at 52 liang. Fu Xing Yong, Yi Fung Yong, Rui Kang Yuan, Da Yong, Da De Cheng, and others suddenly sold, so it fell by several qian. At 9:50+, it was 50 liang and 3 qian. After that, it revolved around 51 liang, only fluctuating by a few qian. Hang Xing, Zhi Feng, Yi Fung Yong, Ying Fung, Hang Gan, Chang Xiang, and others all bought within 51 liang. Soon after, Yong Feng and Ri Chang also entered. September British gold was almost at 125, and US dollars offered November US dollars at 30 yuan and absorbed November at 0.0625, so at 11 o'clock it was 51 liang and 9 qian. After entering, Xie Xing Yong, Ri Chang, and Heng Yu Fu exited, falling by 1 liang. At 11:25, it was 50 liang and 6 qian. Then, the silver company came to buy October US dollars at 93.75, Mitsui bought September at 81.25, and Tong Tai Cheong and others bought, immediately pulling up one liang, to 51 liang and 7 qian. By the time of the noon close, it was 51 liang and 3 qian, which was then increased to 1 liang and 6 or 7 qian.</p>
<p>The afternoon was stable. The market opened at 51 liang and 3 qian, then from 1 liang and 4 qian to 1 liang. Later, because of August US dollars doing 68.75, Old Citibank absorbed 68.75, and foreign merchants also settled 68.75 for entry and 62.5 for July, so the market rebounded. Da De Cheng, Yi Fung, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong, and others competed to buy, and the price jumped two liang. At 2:45, it was 52 liang and 9 qian. At that time, Gan Chang Xiang and others sold, so it retreated to 2 liang and 1 qian. For a moment HSBC absorbed 56.25 in July, Mitsui bought 87.5 in October. Kai Tai, Zhi Feng Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Yong, Da De Cheng continued to make progress, and the price increased by more than one liang. At 3:30, it was 53 liang and 7 qian. Tong Tai Chang sold, and then retreated to 2 liang and 3 qian, but buyers rose one after another. In short, the strips on the market were dry. At 4:20+, it was 53 and a half liang. Suddenly, Heng Yu came to sell. At 4:30, the market closed at 52 liang and 8 qian, which was 3 liang and 3 qian higher than the previous day. Hang Xing bought, and then raised it to 53 liang. According to the highest price of the day was 53 liang and 7 qian, the lowest price was 50 liang, with a difference of 3 liang and 7 qian. Bare bars increased by 9 and a half liang.</p>
<p>The marked price was slightly suppressed by 4 liang. The marked price was still 821 liang due to the lack of change in US dollars, with a deduction of about 70 liang. The back market was 70 liang to 67-8 liang, which was 4 liang less than the previous day. The registered accounts were 54 liang in August, 51 liang in September. This month has been settled clearly. The water supplement for the front and back market was 51 liang.</p>
<p>There were no wholesale transactions. There were no large transactions on the market. According to statistics, Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Gan Chang Xiang, Yi Feng Yong, Ying Fung Heng, Tong Chun, Heng Xing, Fu Tai Heng, Yong Feng, Heng Chang Yong, Hong Kang Yong, and Yuan Xing Yong all entered. Tong Tai Chang, Shun Li, Da De Cheng, Yuan Da Yong, Fu Xing Yong, and Heng Yu all exited. Yuan Tai, Xie Xing Yong, Fu Shun, and Fu Yu had many ups and downs. In the afternoon, Zhi Feng Yong, Tai Feng Cheng, Yi Feng Yong, and Da De Cheng all entered. Tong Tai Chang and Gan Chang Xiang all exited. Da Xing Yong, Yuan Tai, Heng Yu, Long Sheng, Hong Kang Yong, and Fu Tai Heng were sometimes in and sometimes out. On that day, the Dalian gang entered more than 100 bars and exited more than 100 bars. The Cantonese gang was also idle, only entering one hundred and several tens of bars.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Foreign Exchange Stabilized, No Special Changes <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday, the silver market's British currency fell and the US was flat, while the exchange rate rose. In this port, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged except for a small decrease of 0.025 for India and an increase of one yuan for the French franc. The internal market was initially flat, then relaxed, then stabilized. As a result, the British and American exchange rates each shrank by 0.0625 compared to the previous day, causing the gold price to continue to rise by more than 3 liang. Banking transactions were still uncommon, with 50 to 60 thousand pounds being transacted, mostly matched, and the gold brokers settling slightly. Also, 6-700,000 yuan of US dollars were transacted, with Chinese merchants slightly taking advantage. Also, various banks made mutual receipts and payments. Silver companies bought October, and foreign firms still settled a lot. However, there was not much hedging activity. The transactions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Throughout the day, the British internal market only rose and fell by 0.0625, from an early price of 1 shilling 8 pence 0.0625 to 1.875, a buying price of 0.125 to 0.25. Zhengjin and Huabi, HSBC and Mitsui all matched September 0.125. HSBC also offered November 0.25, Huabi offered September 0.125.

<p>Yesterday's weather was extremely hot, with the scorching sun like fire, few pedestrians, and the commercial market was depressed. The financial market was inevitably overshadowed. In the morning market, there was nothing to speak of in the banking sector. The afternoon market was slightly more active, but the prices of each market were generally bleak. In terms of settlement, the situation of Chinese and foreign banks was not as strong as the previous few days. The course of yesterday's market is described in detail below:</p>
<p>The "foreign interest rate" was 6 qian 9 fen 4 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half, which was 6 hao 2 hu and a half smaller than the previous day. The afternoon market rebounded by 3 hao 7 hu and a half, which was 6 qian 9 fen 5 li. The "silver discount rate" was one qian for both markets in the morning, with a bank listed price of 4 fen, and a haircut plus water of about 2 qian.

<h3 id="e121">Securities Exchange Temporarily Suspended Afternoon Trading <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The term is three weeks, starting today.</p>
<p>Yesterday's prices were weak, with a transaction volume of 3.4 million.</p>
<p>In recent ten days, the heat has been pressing, and the high temperature has not been seen for many years. In previous summers, the Hua Securities Exchange in this port has partially suspended operations every afternoon to facilitate business. This year, it was originally decided to open as usual, but due to the continuous hot weather, it has been difficult to open as usual. Therefore, it was approved yesterday as requested by all parties to temporarily suspend all afternoon trading, for a period of three weeks. Whether it is necessary to extend the period in the future will depend on the environmental situation at that time. As for yesterday, each session was still opened. Spot trading was extremely rare, with a total of only 7,000 yuan. The futures market was slightly more active than the previous day, and buying and selling were slightly more active. The total transaction volume for the day was 3.43 million yuan, with the central salt tax accounting for 810,000, the consolidated tax accounting for 610,000, the 20 tariff accounting for 500,000, and the others each accounting for about 300,000+. Next, the 1996 tariff and military reorganization each accounted for only 50 to 60 thousand yuan. As for the trend of each bond, it was generally quite peaceful, but the sentiment was weaker, with sellers dominating the market, continuing to shrink slightly from the previous day by about 4 to 5 jiao. Checking the reason for the market's daily weakness is that the diplomatic situation is gradually deteriorating.</p>

<p>(Report from American Eastern Banking Corporation)</p>
<p>After continuous gains last week, New York stock prices remained firm at the opening of trading this Monday. Subsequently, news spread of underwhelming second-quarter operating conditions for several industrial companies. This inevitably unsettled investors, leading to a gradual market downturn. Industrial stocks fell by 1.22 points, while railroad and utility stocks each declined by slightly more than half a point. Steel production rates last week had recovered to 15 percent, but this news failed to stem the downward trend. The results of the DuPont Company's second-quarter operations showed earnings of only four cents per share, causing the company's stock to plummet by over three points, reaching a low of $22.125. If upcoming second-quarter reports from other companies fail to meet expectations, the stock market is likely to continue its decline. The Dow Jones Averages for the week are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e123">Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Exhibits Stability <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Due to the ongoing brisk sales of spot yarn, cotton yarn market conditions and futures listings are still lower than spot prices, creating a relatively solid barrier. Sellers are hesitant to move forward. While there is a slight increase in market prices, it feels thin and weak on the surface. The phenomenon is stable, but short sellers are not making any significant moves. Overall, considering both direct and indirect factors, there is no room for excessive optimism.</p>
<p>Man-Marked Yarn Up Four to Nine Cash, Cloth-Marked Yarn is Very Dull. Prices rose mid-day due to good spot yarn trading and a shortage of sellers, but the market returned to a mediocre state at closing. Ultimately, it rose four to nine cash. A total of 16,200 bales were traded throughout the day. Closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>July contract    144.60   Up 0.60   October contract 145.70   Up 0.4</p>
<p>August contract   145.50   Up 0.80   November contract 145.70   Up 0.5</p>
<p>September contract 145.90   Up 0.90   December contract 145.90   Up 0.6</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Up Half a Tael, Light Volume. Except for continued inactivity from the North, spot yarn trading was brisk among other regional merchants, boosting confidence. Market prices rose by 2.5 to 5 cash. Total market volume was approximately 2,200 bales. Volume by region is listed below:</p>
<p>Wanxian 70 Shantou 210 Xuzhou 10 Same Trade 15</p>
<p>Yunnan 1,171 Sichuan 540 Anqing 110</p>

<h3 id="e124">Cotton Is Peaceful, That's All <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Cotton conditions are unremarkable. Prices are truly in a state of equipoise between rising and falling, and the environment is mixed with both advantages and disadvantages. New activity from both long and short positions has decreased, with most activity being settlement, so there is no new development in the market. What is worth noting is the strength of spot deliveries in July and August, and favorable weather.</p>
<p>Zheng-Marked Cotton Slightly Up, Cloth-Marked Cotton. At the opening, due to news of good spot cotton the previous day, but failing, American cotton fell. It was then reinforced by the settlement of man-marked cotton, but later weakened due to some long positions closing. As a result, all months rose by five fen to one cash, except for a small five fen decrease in the current month. A total of 27,800 bales were traded throughout the day. Closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>July contract   30.40   Down 0.05   November contract 30.75   Up 0.05</p>
<p>August contract  30.90   Up 0.10    December contract 30.75   Up 0.05</p>
<p>September contract 30.80   Up 0.10</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Strong. Factory deliveries of spot cotton continue to be good. This is enough to excite investors at this time between seasons. Transactions are listed below:</p>
<p>Tongyi Yarn Factory buys, Huo Ji Flower, 100 bales, priced at 28.75, Spot delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Chongxin again buys, Again, 100 bales, priced at 28.75, Again</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to poor weather but weakened later due to long liquidations and unfavorable spot market conditions. Futures fell by 10 to 14 points, and spot prices fell by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by six points, and spot prices rose by four points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by five points. Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 18th):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the number of shipments arriving in South Shanghai from various regions was scarce, and the inventory at the docks was limited. The early morning market activity was not very lively. Riverbank dockworkers completely ceased operations by 3:00 PM. Changshu/Wuxi japonica rice was priced closely with Suzhou rice. Early and late rice prices lacked support and declined. Sales of foreign rice were scarce but brisk, with a firm price of one foot. Yuan cargo sold less due to overcast conditions. Prices are expected to continue to increase.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was clear in Xinzha. The supply of Suzhou and Changshu japonica rice was limited, with only sporadic sales. Medium and top grades showed no improvement. Buyers gradually tightened their bids. There was some activity in thin rice from the countryside. Opening prices decreased by one jiao. The supply of foreign Du tip rice was scarce. Riverbank areas and rice mills had limited inventory. Prices have increased by several fen. Sources from the Western routes included Wuxi, Liyang, Kunshan, Jiangyin, and Qingpu, grades 8 and 9.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Ningbo Merchants Continue to Procure Old Broken Rice <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Total Volume of 10,000 Bags Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign rice remained firm. Ningbo merchants were still active, while North and South merchants paused again. Various routes, including the Yangtze River, Jiangbei, and inland, continued to see sales. The total market opened with over 6,000 bags of old broken rice, priced at 8.9 to 8.85 yuan; 5,000 bags of new broken rice, priced at 9.2 to 9 yuan; 300 bags of Mindang rice, priced at 9.7 yuan. All the old broken rice was procured by Ningbo merchants, while the new broken rice was procured by local merchants and small traders. Mindang rice was also purchased by local merchants. Mindang rice had not been sold for a long time, and the price difference from the price sold at the beginning of the month was about one yuan. However, it has improved compared to last week.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Flour Market Suppressed by Factory Sales <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, opening prices for this month through October once again showed tightness. This was because it was rumored in the market that Tin wheat had risen as high as eight jiao. Furthermore, Tianjin merchants newly ordered 200,000 bags of foreign flour, priced at only 1.75 Tianjin taels, which was five fen lower than the previous order. Therefore, outside buyers and general speculative clients tried their best to buy. However, at that time, large factories secretly released large quantities of orders, which was quite significant. By November, speculators gradually realized that opening prices were unstable, so the market fell for no reason by one fen in the second round. This was because the force of factory selling made buyers feel uneasy. On the customer side, customers also returned due to tighter rumors from the Northeast, and the trend turned softer again. After the second round, trading was less, and prices also fluctuated. In the end, this month was slightly better than the previous day by 2.5 li, August fell by 5 li, September fell by 1 fen, October fell by 1.25 fen, and November fell by 1.5 fen, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Distant Wheat Inland Merchants Gradually Release Orders <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Spot Goods Factory Appetite is Still Good... Generally Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, each month showed a trend of near stability and distant weakness. The current month initially rebounded by a small 3 fen, but rebounded again after covering short positions. For the distant months, merchants within the industry, based on foreign wheat quotations, were gradually approaching, and the mistakes of last year could not be repeated. Therefore, the release of orders was quite strong. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was weak due to the decline in the flour market. After observation, the current month may be able to hold, but distant months will be difficult to stabilize. In the end, this month was down a small 1 fen from the previous day, August and September were down a small 3 fen, and October and November were down a small 4 fen. The spot wheat market situation is generally stable due to good factory appetite. Nanjing wheat opened at 2.88 yuan, Bachang wheat at 2.92 yuan, Shuangfeng wheat at 2.88 yuan, Jiading wheat at 2.72 yuan, Zhenjiang wheat at 2.97 yuan, Zhitang wheat at 2.87 yuan, Wusong wheat at 2.8 yuan, Baihegang wheat at 2.85 yuan, and Lujiabang wheat at 2.85 yuan. A total of 3,000 bags were opened, procured by Huafeng, Xinda, and Fuxin, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e130">North-South Goods New Gold Mountain Branches Rise and Fall Quickly <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Since their debut, New Gold Mountain branches have been gradually increasing in color. This is because on one hand, the number of arrivals is small, and on the other hand, the prices are suitable, and supply cannot meet demand. Therefore, in the last shipment, the price of good goods rose to over 32 taels. Yesterday, there was another arrival, and the South Market stores opened first, and the market situation suddenly loosened and fell. Good original branches opened at 30 taels, down about 2 taels. Flat branches remained firm due to their small number, opening at 40 taels and 7 qian. The North Market had not yet opened by evening, and it is expected that there will not be much change.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of foreign firms in this port, foreign firms such as Xiehe, Yihuo, Tongfu, and Tianyu were increasingly interested in green teas such as fine and pointed eyebrow teas from the incoming areas. The city traded more than 3,700 boxes, and the selling price had already increased to 70 taels, a four or five tael increase compared to the previous time. Baochang, Yongyu, Yihuo and other firms are planning to handle fine eyebrow tea from the Wuyuan North Road. Chinese tea merchants, in view of the reduction in domestic production this year, and the recent active tea sales, have become increasingly firm in their attitude. However, the large gangs of green tea in Pingshui currently have no prospect of sales to American firms, and many Chinese merchants tend to sell in smaller quantities, in order to develop sales in Africa.</p>

<p>Snuff-colored (i.e. camel gray) woolen cloth has been out of favor for five or six years. Unexpectedly, in recent times, sales of this color of woolen cloth have recovered smoothly. Currently, snuff-colored flannel for Western suits, snuff-colored barracan, and camel-gray pullovers are selling extremely well, and most have already been swept up by the Western clothing trade. The market stock of snuff-colored barracan and flannel is exhausted. However, mass-produced goods for Chinese-style clothing still do not sell well. Although snuff-colored velvet continues to be released, buyers want to cut prices, so currently, new orders from foreign firms mostly consist of snuff-colored Western suit fabrics. Yesterday, Huavei pullover sold for 7 taels and 2.5 qian, Hualun for 4 taels, Tianxiang Rongtai goods for 3 taels and 8.5 qian, and domestic Zhanghua goods sold for 4 taels and 5 qian to 5 taels and 2.5 qian.</p>

As a result, the market fluctuated. For example, number 2 Great Wall coal also slightly decreased, currently selling for only 8 taels and 7.5 qian per ton.</p>

<p>Saving the Northeast is Saving China</p>
<p>Hoping All Compatriots Across the Nation Will Rise Up and Respond</p>
<p>Tang Juyu, Commander-in-Chief of the Liaodong Self-Defense Army, cabled the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "The country is unfortunate, and the Japanese invaders are encroaching, seizing our land, slaughtering our people, coercing the Han people, and establishing a puppet state. Their various atrocities are beyond description. Juyu and others mourn the disintegration of our land, grieve for the refugees, and vow to defend against disaster with a bleeding heart. We have secretly entered Liaodong and contacted comrades. In a matter of months, followers are like clouds. Thus, on the horse day of April, we swore an oath with blood, and delivered a speech with tears. At the same time, fourteen counties raised the banner of righteousness. Soldiers and civilians were united, sharing a common hatred. Knowing that the masses are no match for the few, and that the strengths are disparate, but in order to fight for the survival of the country and the personality of the nation, any sacrifice is acceptable. In the past two or three months, in Liuhe, Lingjie, Kuandian, Chuanmutai, Yongdianling, Waikekou, Linjiang, and other places, there have been dozens of battles of all sizes. We fought with Chen Bing, pulled flags, and fought to climb. We only mark with red blood, and we do not resign from stepping on sharp blades. The morale of the soldiers is strong, and the Japanese invaders are terrified. However, the lone army is isolated, and there is a shortage of supplies and ammunition. Although there are plans to directly attack Shenyang in three routes, it is difficult to achieve them as scheduled. When I touched my heart at night, I felt deeply ashamed. Now, when the green gauze screen rises and the weeds grow, it is the time for the Japanese invaders and us to fight for the final victory. They are increasing the transfer of elite troops, and the oppression against us is increasing. If it lasts for a long time, I am afraid that we will eventually be taken advantage of by the enemy. Juyu swears to dedicate himself to the country and has long placed life and death out of consideration. What I cannot bear to ignore is the suffering of my 14 counties in Liaodong. When I think of this, I have no tears to shed. In short, saving Liaodong is saving the Northeast, and saving the Northeast is saving China. The situation is urgent, and there is no time to lose. I hope that all compatriots across the country will be aware of the difficulties and dangers, and rise up and respond urgently, so that the merits of several months will not be wasted in one day. The cable is urgent, and I am greatly looking forward to it. Tang Juyu, Commander-in-Chief of the Liaodong People's Self-Defense Army, led Huang Yuzhou, Wang Yuwen, Zhang Weidong, Ying Ruoyu, Zhang Zongguo, Tang Yuzhen, Lin Zhenhuai, Chang Yongan, Deng Tiemei, Li Chunrun, Sun Xiu, Xu Dasan, Li Tanglin, Guo Jingzhi, Wang Xiangbin, Wen Dianjia, Zheng Yufeng, Tan Guanghai, Sun Gengjiu, and all the generals and soldiers respectfully knock their heads, Han."</p>
<h3 id="e135">Customs Authorities Discussed Counter-Locking Liaoguan Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Government's Second Reply Can Be Sent Out Soon</p>
<p>The Government Authorities Decided to Implement a Counter-Locking Policy</p>
<p>Regarding the Northeast customs issue, after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged its second protest with Japan, the Japanese side ignored the views of the government authorities and decided to implement counter-locking when necessary, regardless of whether it responded or not. However, during the transitional period before counter-locking is implemented, there have been recent discoveries of many goods transported from the Northeast to the mainland that hold counterfeit tax receipts from the puppet state. The authorities formally studied the countermeasures yesterday. The news is divided into the following:</p>
<p>Japanese Attitude Yesterday, according to the secretary of the Japanese Embassy, ​​Okazaki, to the reporter of the Xinsheng News Agency, the Central Government's second protest against the Northeast customs issue had already been received. The Japanese government's prepared reply will be sent out soon. The content is roughly the same as the last reply from the Chinese government, stating that the seizure of the Chinese customs in Northeast China has nothing to do with the Japanese government, and the change of the Dalian tax collector is a violation of the agreement, it is said.</p>
<p>Counter-locking Liaoguan Yesterday it was heard that the resolution of the Northeast customs issue has not yet reached the stage of a formal international conference, and is being directly negotiated between China and Japan. However, the Japanese side only accepted the protest against the Dalian customs incident and resigned from other responsibilities. Our authorities have now decided that regardless of their reply or even ignoring it, they will implement counter-locking of Northeast customs when necessary.</p>
<p>Transitional Measures According to diplomatic circles, after receiving a certain document from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the customs authorities a few days ago, the customs authorities in this port held a meeting at about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, led by Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, together with representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, to study the transitional measures before implementing counter-locking of Northeast customs. This is because recently, the mainland has successively discovered goods transported from the Northeast. Whether to allow them to be unloaded or to collect the export tax from the other side on their behalf are all urgent tasks. As a result, because the authorities strictly maintained secrecy, it is still unknown at present.</p>
<h3 id="e136">British Government's Attitude Towards the Puppet State <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The London dispatch of the Zilin News on the 18th stated, "The reporter can assert that the British Foreign Office now recognizes that if Japan recognizes Manchuria at this time, it will be an extremely provocative act, easily inviting criticism from all parties. The attitude of the British government is to firmly adhere to the Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922, especially with regard to the recognized territorial integrity of China in that treaty. Furthermore, the League of Nations investigation team will send out its investigation report at the end of September. Before this report is sent to the League of Nations, any action that may hinder the territorial integrity of China is of course not welcomed by the British government. However, at the same time, it also gives a sympathetic observation to the current administration of Manchuria, and it is willing to give it de facto recognition at an appropriate time in the future, it is said."</p>
<h3 id="e137">Memorial Hall for Mr. Yingshi Held an Opening Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>More than 500 People Attended</p>
<p>The Ceremony Was Exceptionally Grand</p>
<p>The Memorial Hall for the revolutionary martyr Mr. Chen Gong Yingshi was initiated by the members of the Lake Society. Construction began in May of the 18th year and was approved by the central government. It was built on the original site of Chansheng Temple at the corner of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road. In the middle, the construction was suspended due to the Shanghai Incident, so it was postponed until yesterday morning before the completion and opening ceremony was held.</p>
<p>The Thoughtful Reception Before the opening, Chen Aishi, the director of the Lake Society, personally went to the site to take care of and arrange everything, which was extremely meticulous. He also sent a letter to the police, asking them to send police to direct traffic in front of the house. It is estimated that about 30 Chinese and Western Indian detectives were sent, and the Moor Hall Boy Scouts were stationed inside to maintain order. Chen Aishi also personally led the executive committee to receive guests in the hall, and politely refused those who did not wear badges to avoid congestion.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue On the gate of the Lake Society, the national party flag emblem was hung, and it was fully decorated with green pines and colorful flowers. On both sides of the entrance were the signature areas. The front was a white Italian stone staircase with carved railings on both sides, which was very beautiful. The second floor was the main hall of the Memorial Hall. The site was wide and the light was sufficient. The patterns on the four walls were made of light yellow, lake color, and plain white. It was quiet and beautiful, and the plaques donated by various circles were fully hung around. The center was the podium, and the middle was the chairman's table, which was equipped with a microphone. On both sides were piles of flowers and flower baskets donated by the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, and Lin Chairman, Chiang Chairman, Wang President, He Yingqin, Wu Tiecheng, and other important figures. The back was a light green silk curtain, and the pillars on the left and right sides were decorated with pine and cypress couplets, "Supporting the Crisis and Struggling to Make the Business Shine in the Sun and Moon, Becoming Benevolent and Doing Righteousness, Looking Up and Down Without Shame to Heaven and Man", a total of 20 characters. After the curtain was opened, a Party emblem made of fresh flowers on a wall full of green pines was seen. In the middle was the portrait of President Sun Yat-sen, and below it was the military uniform portrait of Mr. Yingshi, with fresh flowers and colored lights decorating the mirror frame around. The seats on both sides of the platform were for representatives, and the seats in the hall were spacious. Before 9:00, the representatives and guests from all parties who participated were crowded. The third floor was the building box of the Memorial Hall.

<p>Wu Tiecheng's Speech: Today is the completion ceremony of Mr. Chen Ying Shi's Memorial Hall. Mr. Ying Shi's contributions were for the good of the Party and the nation. His great achievements and noble spirit have great significance not only in China's past history, but also in the future of the country and society. Today, the government authorities, members of the Lake Society, and the citizens of Shanghai, based on this purpose, built this hall, not only to commemorate Mr. Chen but also to promote Mr. Chen's spirit to alert the people. Today, our country is still in turmoil, and social undertakings are mostly undeveloped. It is hoped that the people will continue Mr. Chen's spirit, work hard and strive to consolidate the foundation of the country, and promote social undertakings. Then the meaning of building this hall can be said to be not obliterated.</p>
<p>Chen Qicai's Report: Chen Qicai, Chairman of the Lake Society, reported on the construction of the Ying Shi Memorial Hall, saying: In the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927], the National Revolutionary Army established itself in the Southeast. The Society commemorated Mr. Ying Shi's revolutionary achievements and submitted a report to the National Government, requesting that a memorial be built for Mr. Ying Shi to show respect and appreciation. At that time, the planned construction included four items: a memorial hall, a business school, a park, and a library. At that time, the Society was preparing to build its own premises, raising funds and looking for land, and actively proceeding. In May of the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929], a report was submitted to the National Government, which ordered the establishment of the Martyr Chen Gong Ying Shi Memorial Hall within the Shanghai Lake Society premises and allocated 50,000 national currency. Subsequently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government allocated 20,000 national currency each, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government allocated 30,000 provincial public bonds, all to subsidize the construction costs of the memorial hall. The Society successively claimed these funds and respectfully hired workers to build the hall. By this month, the project was completed. The construction costs were barely met. Although the internal furnishings and equipment still need to be raised separately, the opening ceremony is being held today, and the various facilities are not yet complete. Please forgive us.</p>
<p>He Yingqin's Speech: Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin said in his speech, "Today is the opening day of the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Hall. I also have the opportunity to come and participate in this grand ceremony, which is a great honor. Regarding Mr. Ying Shi's past efforts in the revolution and his personal thoughts and character, all those who admire him must have a considerable understanding, and there is no need for me to narrate them in detail. However, as we face the many difficulties and tribulations of the country today, with the Red bandits rampant internally, poisoning several provinces, and the Japanese invading externally, forcibly occupying the Northeast, and as we come to Shanghai, which was once bombed and destroyed by Japanese aircraft and warships, to commemorate Mr. Chen, who sacrificed for the revolution more than ten years ago, we see Mr. Chen's spirit of courage, perseverance, and refusal to give up, and we feel more keenly the importance and magnitude of the revolutionary responsibility in the future. We can only hope that the comrades of our Party and the people of the whole country will unite in sincerity and work together to shoulder this important and great revolutionary responsibility, so that the Chinese nation can embark on the path of freedom and equality. Mr. Ying Shi once said to people, 'I hate power and like to fight injustice most in my life. Whenever I see things where the strong bully the weak, I must be angry and feel injustice. Now the world is still an unfair world, so I am willing to do the work of world revolution. However, China now needs revolution as soon as possible. I am also Chinese, so I will start with the Chinese revolution first. After the Chinese revolution is successful, I will do my best to help the revolution of all weak countries and the people of perished countries, so that the power in the world can be completely eliminated, and all nations in the world can achieve independence and freedom. My wish may be completely achieved.' Mr. Ying Shi was killed on May 18th of the fifth year of the Republic [1916]. Although he was envied by Yuan Shikai, his ambition to not see the success of the Chinese National Revolution and to fulfill his great ambition of world harmony was not realized, but his great spirit of saving China and saving mankind is worthy of our admiration and emulation. Now Japan is bullying China everywhere, disregarding all international peace treaties, and no one in the international community has ever upheld justice and imposed severe sanctions on the violent. The so-called independence and freedom of all nations in the world is really far from being achieved. Now we want to commemorate Mr. Chen, and we should follow Mr. Chen's spirit of courage, perseverance, adventure, progress, and struggle, and hold on to a long-term and continuous resistance to the Japanese violent and unreasonable invasion, so that power is eliminated and justice is upheld. Only then can the Chinese nation be liberated by itself, and then can it do its best to help the nations of all weak countries and perished countries and seek mutual liberation. Moreover, the harm of the Red bandits is worse than that of ferocious beasts and floods. In recent years, they have taken advantage of opportunities to obstruct the progress of the National Revolution. This year's war of resistance against Japan has been particularly affected by them. Now we want to commemorate Mr. Chen and complete Mr. Chen's work of striving for the Chinese National Revolution and then striving for world harmony. In particular, we should unite the whole country and concentrate our strength to fundamentally eliminate the Red bandits, so that the National Revolution can have no worries, and its united front against foreign enemies can be consolidated. Mr. Ying Shi also often said to people, 'Opportunities must be created and cannot be waited for. If we can work hard to create opportunities, then even if we cannot sit and wait for success ourselves, we can also create a big trend to promote the progress of society.' Mr. Ying Shi was a revolutionary practitioner. Although he failed many times, he still moved forward constantly, never hesitating and waiting for the revolution to come by itself. Today, the Chinese National Revolution is able to have this foundation, which is naturally created by the Premier's great spirit and personality. However, Mr. Ying Shi faithfully obeyed the Premier's doctrines and actively assisted the revolution. Although he could not succeed, he has already achieved martyrdom. Today, in the newly completed memorial hall, we commemorate him. It is best for everyone to remember these last words firmly, follow them earnestly, and it will definitely be of great help to the success of the National Revolution."</p>
<p>Ye Chucang's Speech: In this magnificent venue, commemorating the bright and great Mr. Chen Ying Shi, we can get an idea that brightness comes from hardship. At this time when the country is in trouble, today in this magnificent memorial hall, reporting on Mr. Ying Shi's history and praising Mr. Ying Shi's personality, we must also know Mr. Ying Shi's former hardships. In the past, ordinary people had roads to walk, but Mr. Ying Shi had no roads to walk. Ordinary people had houses to live in, but Mr. Ying Shi had no houses to live in. Almost under the power of the reactionary warlords, there was no place for Mr. Ying Shi to stand. In the past, Mr. Ying Shi lived in a small building in Yuyang Lane, planning the national military and political affairs. This magnificent memorial hall came from that small building that was not tolerated by others. Here, we can prove that brightness comes from hardship. Now, difficulties have come again, and they are ten or a hundred times greater than the difficulties that Mr. Ying Shi felt at that time. So, how are we going to find brightness from hardship again? We know that we cannot learn from Mr. Ying Shi now, but we still have to learn from Mr. Ying Shi, that is, to learn from Mr. Ying Shi to find brightness from hardship.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech: Mr. Chen Ying Shi's revolutionary spirit is admired by the people of the whole country. I was originally a friend of Mr. Ying Shi and followed Mr. Chen, so I saw Mr. Chen's great spirit. Mr. Chen was taciturn, doing what he said, without hesitation. Therefore, his discussions were few and his successes were many. Mr. Chen not only worked hard for the country, but also benefited farmers, industry, and commerce. For example, the fact that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has such a great venue at Tianhougong Bridge today is also due to Mr. Chen's assistance during the era of the Shanghai Military Governor. Today, you commemorate Mr. Chen, and you should not forget the revolutionary spirit that Mr. Chen left behind. In the future, anyone who dares to engage in civil war is not worthy of Mr. Ying Shi. Anyone who cannot unite against foreign enemies is not worthy of Mr. Ying Shi. Anyone who does not promote national goods is not worthy of Mr. Ying Shi. We must unite our spirits and resist foreign insults together so that we will not fail the meaning of commemorating Mr. Chen today.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Japanese Troops and Japanese Side Have No Intention of Withdrawing from the Gongda and Toyota Factories <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Headquarters of the Naval Landing Force Issued a Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: After the Japanese troops in District D completely withdrew, our side believes that several dozen Japanese naval and army soldiers are still stationed at the Gongda Yarn Factory in Yinxiang Township and the Toyota Yarn Factory in Caojiadu and have not yet withdrawn. This cannot be said to be a complete restoration to the original state before January 28th. Our side, Yu Hongjun, has negotiated with Mr. Okazaki, a Japanese commissioner, several times, requesting withdrawal, but there has been no result. The headquarters of the Japanese Special Naval Landing Force issued a statement specifically on this matter yesterday, expressing no intention of withdrawing. The statement roughly stated that after the withdrawal of troops stationed in District D, the Chinese authorities believed that the Japanese naval and army soldiers still stationed at the Gongda and Toyota yarn factories were not satisfactory and insisted on withdrawal, which was a misunderstanding. It was found that troops have always been stationed at the two factories for protection, which was the case before the January 28th Incident and was absolutely unrelated to the Shanghai war. Therefore, the withdrawal of troops stationed in District D this time is not bound by the ceasefire agreement signed on May 5th. Moreover, the stationed troops are purely for the protection of the yarn factories and do not hinder local security. The Chinese authorities cannot use this as an excuse. However, the headquarters of the Naval Landing Force believes that it will soon be able to automatically withdraw the troops stationed at the two factories within an appropriate period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Plans to Formulate Measures for the Disposal of Existing Japanese Goods <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, It Sent a Letter to All Trade Associations for Notification</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday formulated measures for the disposal of existing Japanese goods and sent a letter to all trade associations, stating: "Dear Sirs, on the 19th of May, fifteen trade associations, including the Cotton Cloth Industry, Color Printing Industry, Brick and Ash Industry, Mineral Ash Factory, Lime Sales Industry, Intestine Industry, Gunny Sack Industry, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, Yarn Industry, Floss Industry, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry, Sugar Industry, Coal Industry, and Electrical Appliance Industry, stated in a letter that since the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stopped working, there have been no measures for the disposal of existing goods. However, it was found that although these goods are inferior goods, they were all purchased by our people with sweat and blood before the Shenyang Incident [Mukden Incident]. If appropriate solutions are not sought, not only will merchants suffer huge losses, but also the social economy will be endangered, which will not help the enemy country. Recently, it was heard that the municipal government is dealing with the unfinished cases of the Anti-Japanese Association, so it is necessary to properly formulate appropriate disposal measures for the goods previously stored by various industries to seek relief and prevent abuses. However, the organizations of various industries are different, and the environments are also different. If a simple method is used universally, it is inevitable that the disease of cutting the feet to fit the shoes will occur. The various trade associations have closer relations with their members and have more relevant knowledge. If your association is responsible for each trade association to separately formulate disposal measures with the principle of preventing abuses, and strictly urge all members to never buy or sell Japanese goods again, it will be more effective and convenient. Therefore, we jointly request that you grant approval, which is in the public interest, etc.' After the meeting, it was decided that each industry should formulate and report appropriate solutions for the existing Japanese goods, depending on the situation, for adoption and implementation, to seek relief and prevent abuses. After the meeting, nine industries responded, and the methods formulated by the Taxi Industry Association and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association were the most practical and detailed. Although the other industries advocated different degrees of detail, they agreed that the associations should be responsible.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>"Associations should be responsible for checking the source of goods in and out, to prevent the continuation of Japanese goods privately. Distribute a volunteer letter and ask each store to fill in the form themselves, and after that never import Japanese goods. Then, the association can organize a group to check and punish stores that import Japanese goods privately." The general idea is the same, which shows that the idea of never buying Japanese goods again has become a widespread and consistent proposition, and the patriotic sentiment of merchants has become more and more firm, which is admirable. It was submitted to the third regular meeting of the second session for discussion, and it was decided that the industries that have not yet responded to the measures for the disposal of existing Japanese goods should also follow the above methods and formulate them properly by each association, and strive to prevent abuses so that private individuals cannot take advantage of the situation. However, each industry must require its members to fill out a voluntary letter and resolutely not import Japanese goods in the future. The association should check at any time, and the above opinions of the regular meeting should be submitted to the second executive committee for discussion and approval on file. It was found that the Japanese aggression in the Eastern Provinces is becoming more and more obvious. Recently, it has openly declared to China and foreign countries that Manchuria will never be returned to China. It is an obvious fact that the Chinese nation must fight to the end against Japan in order to survive. The Northeast Volunteer Army, even in the most difficult circumstances, does not hesitate to sever their bellies and give their lives for the country. All Chinese people must sever economic relations with Japan to provide spiritual support for the Volunteer Army and to control the fate of the crazy enemy economically. Perhaps both sides can advance together, or there will be a day when they will repent and return our occupied land. Therefore, we have recorded the case and notified all associations, one side should pay attention to the disposal of deposited goods, so that they cannot take advantage of the situation, and the other side should pay attention to the prevention of Japanese goods in the future, so as not to cause a resurgence of ashes. In short, if the Chinese nation is not to fall, we must first seek the non-degeneration of our merchants. This huge responsibility, the association is willing to encourage each other with all the associations. Sincerely, and with blessings, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>Appointed Personnel to Be Responsible for Reporting</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: The Dried and Preserved Goods Industry Trade Union of this city deeply regrets that just after the disaster of the January 28th Incident, treacherous merchants, driven by greed and lust, are openly selling inferior goods. The union found that the sales of inferior goods such as white sugar, dried scallops, salted seafood, agar, dried mushrooms, broken ends, seafood, etc. have been quite alarming recently, and effective methods should be used to stop them. Therefore, it was decided at a meeting yesterday to appoint Yu Yaoqiu, Yao Fenglin, Sun Chunshan, Hu Xiaoxiang, Ling Baode, Cheng Wenkui, Mei Lanqing and other seven people to be responsible for actively reporting treacherous merchants from now on, and three measures were formulated: (1) Publish the names of treacherous merchants in the newspaper; (2) Sprinkle stinky chemicals on all inferior goods; (3) Send a letter to the trade association to revoke their membership and revoke their market certificates.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Import of Japanese Goods Has Increased Sharply <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>It Has Returned to the Top Import Position</p>
<p>After September 18th [Mukden Incident], the city established the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and the boycott movement was carried out vigorously. The import of Japanese goods was greatly affected, and it dropped from the first position to the third position. British goods occupied the first position, and American goods occupied the second position. Unexpectedly, after the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the import of Japanese goods became active again, especially Japanese coal, Japanese sugar, and cotton textiles. It has now recovered from the third position to the first position. It is heard that all sectors of the city are now trying to discuss and take effective methods to curb this activity.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Important Notice for Money Exchanges Regarding Reserve Fund <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Failure to Meet 60% Threshold Will Result in Refusal to Sign</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan, since Xu Kan, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, came to Shanghai, a basic decision has been made. Minister of Finance Song Ziwen only needs to visit Shanghai again to discuss and finalize the legal tender price and silver content with the banking and money exchange sectors. The Ministry of Finance can then issue a formal decree to abolish the tael and adopt the yuan. The money exchange sector agrees with this principle in general, but is concerned that the abolition of the tael will be the only step taken, and there will be no good solution for the adoption of the yuan. Even more, they worry that today the yuan will be adopted, tomorrow the jiao will be changed, and the day after the copper coin will be changed, implementing it step by step, which will make it even more difficult to unify the currency system. A reporter from the Kuo Wen News Agency inquired from various parties yesterday and recorded the findings as follows:</p>
<p>Song and Xu Will Come Together: Minister of Finance Song Ziwen departed from Hankou for Lushan and is rumored to return to Beijing today. A reporter inquired at the Song residence yesterday and learned that Song's mission to Hankou included (1) military expenses and (2) tax matters, but also necessitated contacting various sectors in Hankou regarding the abolition of the tael and adoption of the yuan. As for the delay in Lushan, it was to meet with Chairman of the National Government Lin Sen. Now that Mr. Song is scheduled to return to Beijing today, he will likely come to Shanghai the day after tomorrow, and Xu Kan will also come to Shanghai together.</p>
<p>Money Exchange Provisional Meeting: The Money Exchange Association held a provisional meeting at the association the night before last. More than seventy managers of various money exchanges, including Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, and Li Shoushan, attended. After the meeting began, there was also a detailed discussion on the issue of abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan. It is reported that, to prevent a crisis in the credit of paper money, it was resolved: (1) to reorganize the Special Property Custody Committee, and its name will be changed to the Money Exchange Joint Reserve, with a total of 30 million, including 27 million in assets and 3 million in cash; (2) to telegraph to the association's representative examining the issuance reserve, stating that the implementation of abolishing the tael and using the yuan is not far off, and if the reserve cash is less than 60%, do not sign under any circumstances, to protect the safety of the social economy.</p>

It is now learned that the central government is still retaining Dai and will grant him a long leave of absence to recuperate.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Sanyou Industrial Society's Retail Store Reopens Today <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Result of Yesterday's Social Affairs Bureau Inquiry</p>
<p>Food Expenses Maintained by the Company as Usual</p>
<p>After the labor unrest occurred at the Sanyou Industrial Society factory in Yinxiang Township, the Nanjing Road retail store temporarily suspended business due to worker petitions. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned an inquiry yesterday and sent personnel to advise the workers. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inquiry Process: Yesterday morning, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau summoned both labor and management for an inquiry. Ji Jiannan and Lao Huimin of Sanyou Industrial Society, Gong Yuting and Xia Zhongzhao of the 7th District Cotton Textile Industry Union, and Zhou Lianze of the Municipal Party Headquarters attended. Wang Xianqing of the Social Affairs Bureau presided, and Wang Zhiqin recorded. The chairman first reported, briefly stating that the case was being handled jointly by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the case had been submitted to the Municipal Government for arbitration. After instructions were received, they were ordered to reconcile again, so both parties were summoned again, hoping to resolve the matter as soon as possible with the principle of settling matters peacefully. The management reported that a shareholders' meeting was held yesterday and after repeated discussions, it was believed that there was a backlog of inventory, difficulties in economic circulation, and this year's market was not as good as last year, so there was no capacity to start work. The labor representatives reported that they had made concessions several times and hoped to resolve the matter as soon as possible, but the company made a profit last year, which is a fact. Now, instead of reducing the Hangzhou factory established in 1918, it is shifting responsibility to the general factory established in 1912, which is not justified legally or logically. Then the discussion began. The management requested to stop the workers from petitioning at the retail store to maintain business and refused to provide food expenses to the workers again. The labor representatives said that the workers' petition was spontaneous and a last resort. Later, the chairman proposed: (1) both labor and management should wait for the government to resolve the matter, (2) the management should maintain the workers' food expenses as usual, and (3) the labor representatives should be responsible for persuading the workers not to petition at the retail store again, hindering labor. Both parties were ordered to comply, and the meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Advise: Xu Yefu, Head of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, dispatched Zhu Jin together with Gong Yuting, Director of the 7th District Cotton Textile Industry Union, and others to the general factory of Sanyou Industrial Society in Yinxiang Township at 2:00 PM yesterday to advise all workers to wait for the Party and government authorities to resolve the matter according to law, and the food expenses will be provided by the management as usual, and the workers should no longer petition at the retail store, hindering business. The workers accepted the advice. It is reported that the Nanjing Road retail store of Sanyou Industrial Society is scheduled to resume business starting this morning.</p>

<p>Labor-Management Dispute Awaiting Authorities to Mediate</p>
<p>Arrested Workers to Be Interrogated by the Court Today</p>
<p>After the labor unrest occurred at the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory in West Shanghai, the court scheduled an interrogation today regarding the worker-police clash. The union resolved to resume work this morning, and the Party and government authorities thoroughly investigated yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau scheduled mediation for today. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Party and Government Thorough Investigation: The Social Affairs Bureau, following instructions from the Municipal Government, properly handled the labor-management dispute at the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and dispatched Zhu Guilin together with Zhou Lianze of the Municipal Party Headquarters to the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory of the 2nd District Dyeing Industry Union and the 6th District Police Station of the Public Security Bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to mediate according to law.</p>
<p>Court Interrogation: The fifteen arrested workers, including Huang Guifen, were transferred to the Local Court by the Public Security Bureau for obstructing official duties, and a public prosecution will be filed. A hearing was specifically scheduled for 10:00 AM today. Yesterday, workers Feng Aming and Jiang Cairong, patrolman Hu Lizhong, and police officers Zhang Chuanfu, Sun Depu, and Zhu Hongbin were summoned to court for questioning.</p>
<p>Notice to Resume Work: The 3rd District Dyeing Industry Union issued a notice to all members yesterday stating that due to the unemployment of unemployed workers at the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, there was no hope of resuming work, resulting in a complete cessation of work. Now, in order to maintain the livelihood of workers currently employed by the union, a meeting of directors was specifically convened and it was resolved to strongly advise workers currently employed to resume normal work, and strictly comply. This notice is hereby given. Acting Permanent Director Yu Ying, July 19, 1932.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Chen Shuren's Solo Exhibition a Great Success <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Highly Praised by Chinese and Foreign Personages</p>
<p>Chen Shuren's solo painting exhibition closed yesterday (July 19th). It was held in Shanghai for five days, and the number of visitors totaled 23,000, mostly Shanghai celebrities and artists. The last day was for bankers and industrialists, such as Wang Xiaolai and Lin Kanghou, who came together to view it. In recent days, it has been highly praised by Chinese and foreign personages, adding luster to China's art scene. Its impact on the future of Chinese art and culture is self-evident. However, it is especially important for the Shanghai masses who have suffered a great calamity to receive this spiritual comfort, which is more important than any remedial measure. Therefore, Mr. Chen's solo exhibition has been warmly welcomed by the masses for no reason. Mr. Chen hosted people from various countries at the World College last night, and the atmosphere was also very lively. Portuguese painter Carvalho praised Mr. Chen's art as unprecedented in China for thousands of years, and said that the painting "Flying Waterfall in Dinghu" is worth more than 50,000 gold. He wants to write a long commentary on the other sixteen paintings such as "Crows Crowing in the Snow," "Straight Up to the Clouds," "Green Bamboo," "Banana," and "Guilin Landscape," and wrote an English poem on the spot praising "Crows Crowing in the Snow" as a rare masterpiece in the world. Others, such as Gao Qi, who hand-carved the plaster statue of Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum copper coffin, and William, a famous British painter, also had similar criticisms, lingering and admiring, unable to leave until late at night. Mr. Chen's art is so deeply moving. It is a pity that all the works in Mr. Chen's solo exhibition will not be sold. Those who want to exchange a foot of silk for ten thousand gold cannot get it, and there is always regret, which is a fly in the ointment. According to the investigation, the products in Mr. Chen's solo exhibition will be transported to Europe and the United States for exhibition, so they are not willing to give them to others for the time being.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Female Physiognomist Wen Ying Assassinated <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Her Mother Also Injured</p>
<p>Nothing More Than a Love Affair</p>
<p>One Suspect Has Been Arrested</p>
<p>A woman known as Madam Wen Ying, surnamed Yang, is a female physiognomist. She lived with her mother, Wu, at No. 89 Pingle Lane, Racecourse Road, in the Public Concession. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, she was suddenly murdered in her home and stabbed to death on the spot. Wu was also injured. Afterwards, the Zhabei police station sent detectives to pursue the murderer, and a suspect has already been arrested and temporarily detained at the police station for interrogation. The circumstances of Wen Ying's death are recorded as follows: Wen Ying, surnamed Yang, was 18 years old and originally from Shaoxing. She used to study at the female physiognomist Ling Qing's place. In the past two years, the teacher and apprentice separated and made a living by physiognomy, renting a house in Pingle Lane, which was quite narrow. She only hired a small maid to answer the door. Yesterday morning, a man named Fan Ruibao went to Wen Ying's place to visit. After a while, a man named Chen went to talk to her. Chen left first, and Fan left later. Around 3:50 PM, when Wen Ying was smoking opium on the couch, Fan suddenly came again and asked her to go to Lao Si's place. The woman refused, saying that if there was anything, Lao Si could be told to come and talk. Hu went. At this time, Wen Ying had gotten up and was dressing up at the dressing table. Her mother, Wu, was doing needlework next to her. Seeing that the woman was displeased, Fan took out a small silver coin from his pocket and gave it to the maid, A Jin, to buy cigarettes. The maid went out. About six or seven minutes later, because the small silver coin was made of lead, she dejectedly returned. When she reached the intersection of Second Malu and Xizang Road, she suddenly saw her mistress, Wu, running west with her clothes stained with blood, as if she was chasing someone. A Jin stepped forward to ask what was wrong, but she did not answer. So she returned home alone. Entering through the back door, she passed the stove shed and saw Wen Ying lying face down in the alley, covered in blood. She was greatly shocked and immediately reported to the patrolling police, who took Wen Ying and Wu to the hospital. Wen Ying died due to her serious injuries and could not be saved. She had three stab wounds on her body, one in the throat, one in the heart, and one in the left chest, all of which were fatal. Wu, 54 years old, had seven or eight wounds on her shoulders and hands, and her condition was also critical. It is reported that the deceased had an affair with the physiognomist Diao Keke, who lived in the New World, and later had a relationship with Fan Ruibao, the murderer. As for the man named Chen, it is said that he was also the woman's lover. Therefore, Wen Ying's death was nothing more than a love affair. The suspect arrested by the police was arrested from the New World Hotel.</p>

<p>Even Shed Tears and Escapes Death</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at the intersection of Caishen Road and Laozha Road in the French Concession, a cattle dealer led nine yellow cattle through the area, intending to send them to the slaughterhouse on Titoni Lane. One of the cattle refused to move forward. The cattle dealer whipped it repeatedly, but it was still difficult to move it. Therefore, the other eight cattle were taken away first, and this cattle was left tied to a telephone pole on the side of the road. Unexpectedly, as soon as the cattle dealer left, the cattle broke the rope and rushed around, overturning several rickshaws along the way. Many people gathered to watch. After fleeing for a long time, it first entered the Si Ru Chun Noodle Restaurant and escaped from the back door, breaking into No. 177 Yanshou Lane, which is the accounting room of the Zhonghua Fuji Knitting Factory, which moved in this morning. No matter how much they shouted to drive it away, it would not leave, and the cattle knelt on the ground and bellowed. At this time, the cattle dealer also arrived and entered the factory to pull the cattle away. The manager of the factory, Qian, negotiated with the cattle dealer, saying that the factory had just moved in today, and the cattle rushing in was unlucky. Incense and candles must be prepared before it can be taken away. At that time, the cattle dealer misunderstood and called the Vietnamese police, reporting to the police station that the factory was detaining the cattle. After the police chief sent a detective to investigate, he realized it was a misunderstanding. Witnesses said that the cattle knelt on the ground and bellowed, and there were tear marks. Therefore, the factory manager negotiated with the cattle dealer and the factory paid $24.50 to buy the cattle and send it to the Release Life Bureau for raising and releasing.</p>

<p>Liu Tongsheng, a comprador of the Western medicine department of the Tianna Foreign Firm and a native of Jiujiang, was kidnapped by bandits at 218 Yuezhou Road in front of his house around 10:00 AM on the 6th of this month, but he soon escaped. Afterwards, Lu Gengsheng, the Chinese detective chief of the Huishan Police Station, arrested four kidnappers from Tongzhou: Qian Xuen, Ji Jinhua, Wang Alin (also known as Tang Hongfu and Tang Liancheng), and Jiang Jingui. A pistol marked with the words "Chinese Public Security Bureau" and two loads of bullets were seized and sent to the First Special District Court. After repeated trials, the verdict was reached yesterday morning. Judge Fu took the bench and announced the verdict: Qian Xuen, Ji Jinhua, and Wang Alin were all sentenced to death for jointly kidnapping and extorting ransom. Jiang Jingui was given a reduced sentence of eighteen years of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed was allowed to be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day. The pistol was stored in the warehouse pending collection, and the bullets were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Zhang Changsheng, Notorious Robber in Junpu Bureau Robbery Case, Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Changsheng, a river bandit from Pudong, also known as Xiao Changsheng, colluded with Zhang Genbao and Feng Qing, who had already been executed, to rob a large sum of money from the Junpu Bureau's Lifi steamboat, killing one Chinese and one foreign engineer. This happened on May 30th of the previous year. At that time, Zhang Changsheng was on the run. In the past year, Zhang Changsheng was carrying a pistol and planned to rob Zhang San's house on Lafayette Road in the French Concession, when he was caught by a detective near Xiaodongmen Dongmen Road. He confessed to the previous crime and was sent to the Local Court. After repeated trials, Zhang Changsheng was sentenced to death in accordance with the Law on the Punishment of Banditry. After being approved by the Provincial Government, an order to execute the robber was sent to the Criminal Court of the court. The court immediately secretly consulted the Procuratorate, and at 9:00 AM yesterday, the original Prosecutor Yang Qi, accompanied by Clerk Li Tingfan, ascended to the interrogation court and brought Zhang Changsheng to the case, verified his identity, and interrogated him. He confessed that he was 27 years old, from Pudong, and lived in the Lao Bing Factory on Pudong Xinmalu. He asked them to send a letter to the Chengxingyuan Teahouse, and instructed his mother Zhang Chen to take good care of his daughter. Also, his biological mother's surname was Yao, and she lived at the Zhu Family Wooden Bridge in Yangjing East. He asked them to tell her the news. He said that he had a wife at home who was young and could stay if she could, and marry someone quickly if she couldn't, and not worry about him. He is now appealing, and death is death, and appealing is appealing. At this point, it was over. The judge then ordered Police Chief Xu Jinqing, Police Sergeant Chen Xihui, and execution police officers Gu Hanqing, Xue Bingzhang, Zhang Chunshen, Yin Daoxu, and Zou Zhendong to escort the prisoner onto a car and drive to the Caohejing Second Prison for execution by firing squad. The body was collected by the hall and sent to wait for collection.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Plague is Rampant in Wusong <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Patients Die in Less Than an Hour</p>
<p>More Than a Dozen People Have Died Before and After</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been hot and sultry, and the plague is prevalent everywhere. Those who are infected die in less than an hour, which is truly terrifying. Zhao Heshi, the elder brother of Zhao Changsheng, a coach of the Second Team of the Wusong Guard Corps, was over 40 years old and a native of Anhui. He is now engaged in farming in Zhujia Bang, north of Songzhen. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, Heshi still went to the street to buy vegetables. Immediately after, he felt unwell and immediately went home. Shortly after arriving home, he began vomiting and diarrhea. When his younger brother Changsheng learned of this, he invited a doctor to his home for treatment. Because the plague was rampant, he died in less than an hour. Also, Shan Mao (everyone calls him Shan Mazi), who lives in the newspaper office on Wenchang Road in Songzhen, is nearly 50 years old. He has always been fond of wine. The day before yesterday afternoon, he suddenly contracted the tiger plague, vomiting and diarrhea non-stop. When a scrape therapist arrived, he said that he had a severe case of snail Sha disease and was difficult to treat. He died at midnight. Also, a certain Jia, a stacker at the Wusong Flour Mill, also died of the same plague. In addition, three people from Jiangbei who lived in the back of Songzhen and the Yin Family Residence also died of the plague. In recent days, the plague has been quite prevalent in the vicinity of Songzhen and in various villages, so there have been many deaths due to the plague. However, those who receive appropriate treatment can avoid danger.</p>
<h3 id="e160">National Salvation Association Opposes Public Sale of Opium <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The National Salvation Association telegraphed: Since the September 18th Incident, patriotic people have been running around calling for action and encouraging each other to strengthen their national spirit and prepare for a long-term resistance. Government authorities have repeatedly declared and encouraged the people to revive the national spirit and prepare for a long-term resistance. How can the words still be ringing in our ears, and the foreign troubles are getting deeper, but suddenly there is this self-destructive policy of public sale of opium. Recently, Wang Jingwei, Song Ziwen, Liu Ruiheng, and others have been running between Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, secretly negotiating and about to turn the plan into a reality. At the same time, there are rumors in Jiangsu Province of dividing the area for tax package, and there is also a resolution in Hubei Province to cancel the ban on smoking opium by order. This is the proof. The main reason for the decline of the nation is the oppression of foreign troubles, and the harm of opium is known to all. The government has solemnly announced it as a strict prohibition for more than a day. At a time when the enemy is deep and things are urgent, efforts should be made to prohibit it, and there is no reason to impose prohibition on taxation. What's more, the government authorities' goal is not prohibition but taxation. If the public sale is not enough, they will continue to encourage planting and sales. If the encouragement of planting and sales is not enough, they will continue to force planting and sales. Eventually, the people under the blue sky and white sun will be reduced to blacklisted opium addicts. Then our Chinese nation will not wait for the iron hooves of the imperialists to destroy it, but will enter the tomb on its own. Moreover, in the past, we had an obligation to abide by the opium treaty between China and Britain, and we were also a signatory country to the Hague Convention on Prohibition of Opium. Whenever foreigners come to China for investigation, the government still covers up in every possible way. Now that it is once implemented for public sale, what will the international community think of us? Moreover, the so-called opium public sale system is a harsh policy of the British and Dutch countries towards their colonies. Japan will use it to destroy the Taiwanese nation. Now, the government authorities will definitely regard our people as slaves of a fallen country, but how do our people regard themselves? Now, let's take a hundred steps back. The reason why the government must carry out the public sale of opium is to save the poverty of finance. The economic panic in various countries in the world has reached its extreme. I have never heard of poisonous substances that harm the people being listed as a source of tax. It goes without saying that the current government authorities cannot bear to treat the people as grass and use harsh policies. With the arrogance of the military personnel in various provinces today, and the corruption of tax collection personnel, how can the so-called central government, which cannot command the country, hope to have a trickle of money go to the public? Just look at the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, etc. Opium has been publicly sold for a long time. How much has it benefited the national treasury or the provincial treasury? In the past, the Qing Dynasty created Likin, which was also aimed at alleviating the urgent need for finance, and it has harmed us for decades. Now the government has decisively abolished it, and the disaster of public sale of opium is not a thousand times worse. Even if the government does not consider the rise and fall of the country, does it not consider the future generations? Our association, fearing the danger of drinking poison to quench thirst, and thinking about the danger of national subjugation and species extinction, hereby represents the 3 million people of Shanghai, vowing to oppose it to the death. I hope that compatriots across the country will rise up together to promote the government's reflection. I hereby telegraph to report, please be informed. Shanghai National Salvation Association</p>
<h3 id="e161">Taxpayers' Association Protests Water Company's Breach of Contract <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating that it received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' Rent Reduction Movement Committee stating that the Hongyuan Lane Real Estate Association in Hongkou and the Zhaohui Lane Real Estate Association on Robinson Road have stated in succession that they are involved in litigation due to demanding that landlords waive wartime rents. Now it is still under trial. Unexpectedly, the water company suddenly sent personnel to completely cut off the water in the lane on the 5th and 6th. The association immediately sent personnel to negotiate with the company and inquired about the reason for the water cut. It was said that it was the landlord's order, and you can directly demand it from the landlord. The association is now involved in litigation due to demanding rent reduction, and should wait for the legal solution. The landlord does not hesitate to use public utilities to exert high-pressure tactics and cut off the water source. Moreover, more than a dozen households have installed their own water pipes and pay their own water prices, but they also suffer the same damage. The water company also suffers from the landlord's use, ignoring the peace and tranquility of society, which is unreasonable. If a fire breaks out, the households in the lane will be in an irreparable situation. I am here to report the situation and ask your association for help as soon as possible to benefit the people and value hygiene. The Water Company is not a tool of the landlord, and your bureau has specifically stipulated in the water contract to prevent this from happening: "When there are people living in the house, the water company shall not cut off the water supply at the request of the landlord, and the fee shall still be borne by the landlord." However, your bureau has not imposed liability on the water company for violating the contract for cutting off the water of the Yuchang Coal Shop on Suzhou Road and the Huifang Lane on Fuzhou Road at the request of the landlord. Therefore, they dare to continue to act selfishly, and even cut off the water that users who directly enter into a water supply contract should receive. The impact of this is unpredictable. It seems that it is not permissible for your bureau to neglect its duties. I hereby ask your bureau to quickly correct the mistakes of the water company and not first acquire the important task of this patent right, so as to avoid a serious situation.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, a few Japanese soldiers suddenly came to the Fourth Branch of the Chinese Jesus Church on Huta Road on the evening of May 18, carrying weapons and breaking into the house, and took six Christians, including three men, one woman, and two children, to the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps in the 63 Garden, and then moved to the headquarters of the Fourth Brigade on Pingliang Road. They have not been released so far. Yu Guozhen, the president of the association, went to the Municipal Government yesterday to request negotiation with the Japanese side for release. Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government has raised the matter with Okazaki, the joint commissioner of the Japanese side, and Okazaki has agreed to investigate with the team and then reply.</p>

<p>Wang Renlin, acting director of the China branch of the International Labour Office, departed from Shanghai yesterday by train to head north, to investigate the situation of northern laborers, contact local organizations and scholars researching labor issues, and thereby seek to unify the organizations and work studying labor issues in China. It is said that this trip will last for one month, with stops in Nanjing, Jinan, Tianjin, and Beiping. While in Beijing, he will also liaise with the Ministry of Industry, requesting the National Government to approve the following international conventions as soon as possible: (1) establishing free public employment agencies; (2) female industrial and commercial workers should not work for six weeks before and after childbirth, and their salaries should be paid as usual; (3) child labor under the age of fourteen should not be engaged in industrial work; (4) agricultural workers should have the right to freely associate and assemble, equal to industrial workers; (5) industrial workers should have one day of rest each week; (6) workers should receive compensation for work-related injuries; (7) workers should receive disease compensation for work-related illnesses. The benefits given to laborers in the above seven labor conventions have all been recognized by our government and are included in various labor laws, so granting approval is merely a formality, which will not hinder the development of our industry and will at the same time win international goodwill.</p>

<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court recently received instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to handle the amnesty. The amnesty procedure is roughly divided into three classes: (1) those sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than seven years will have one-third of their sentence commuted; (2) those sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years but less than seven years will have two-thirds of their sentence commuted; (3) those sentenced to imprisonment for less than three years will be completely pardoned. The branch court relayed the order to the First Special District Local Court under its jurisdiction, instructing it to gather all relevant files of those eligible for amnesty, categorize them by sentence length, and submit a list for review. However, due to the large number of files in the First Special Court, the review process will take some time, so they are starting with the files of those sentenced to imprisonment for less than three years. This has now been largely completed and reported to the High Branch Court, which reviewed and found twelve people eligible for amnesty last Saturday. Release warrants were immediately signed and sent to the prison warden for release. As of yesterday morning, three more people were found to be eligible for amnesty and were immediately brought to court, where Judge Yu announced their release in court. However, one of them was convicted of a crime of disturbing public morals, so he was ordered to provide bail as a restriction. It is reported that as of March 5, the First Special Court had sentenced more than two thousand criminals to imprisonment for less than three years. If all of them meet the amnesty regulations and are pardoned, the Tilanqiao Prison will be alleviated of overcrowding.</p>

Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the chief of the First Criminal Division of the court, and Judge Wu Tingqi, took turns presiding over the first and second divisions, and proposed to announce the revised sentences for more than twenty criminals who had been resentenced, one by one. These revised sentences were all shorter than the original sentences, so most of them had already completed their sentences based on the new judgments and should be released immediately. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police department appeared in court and stated that he had no objection to the new judgments. Many were released in court, and only a few returned to prison.</p>

<p>The Narcotics Department of the Public Works Department, led by Detective Song Bingzheng, cracked down on a case in Room 511 of the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road, where a Japanese ronin was colluding with unscrupulous Chinese to secretly set up a mechanism for selling green gas guns and cannons, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Japanese, named Kawano, Taniguchi, and Nakama, who were handed over to the Japanese consulate, have been ordered by the Japanese consul to be detained pending investigation. As for the two Chinese, Xu Zailin, from Ningbo, and Tian Chunyi (a misspelling of Tian Chunnian), from Shaoxing, were brought to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning by the police, along with nine green gas guns seized in the case, more than two hundred bottles of medicinal liquid, a submachine gun, more than five hundred rounds of ammunition, and handgun catalogs. Judge Qian presided over the interrogation. According to police lawyer Ru Baoyi, the three Japanese suspects handed over to the Japanese consulate were reportedly scheduled to be tried this morning. The confessions of these suspects are extremely important to this case. The police have not yet heard how they confessed, so he requested that the trial of this case be adjourned. Judge Qian then ordered the two defendants, Xu and Tian, to be remanded in custody and adjourned the trial for seven days.</p>

<p>The tragic love triangle involving little sister Li Minghui in Hong Kong, because the murderer Wang Nengxiang (also known as Wang Renxiang) fled to Shanghai. After being apprehended by Chief Detective Lu Liankui and Detective Liu Shaokui, the First Special District Local Court considered that the case should be tried in Shanghai, rejected the request for extradition from the British official in Hong Kong, and instructed the police to investigate the evidence and prosecute the case. This has been reported in this newspaper many times. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Ru Baoyi formally filed a lawsuit based on Article 282, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, accusing the defendant of murdering Feng Dejing on March 24 on Shankuang Road in Hong Kong. Judge Qian then conducted a trial. The defendant also retained lawyer Zhao Chuanding to appear in court to defend him. According to lawyer Ru, all the evidence in this case is in Hong Kong, so he requested an adjournment for trial. Judge Qian briefly questioned the defendant about his age and address, and ordered him to be remanded in custody, adjourning the trial for fourteen days. As for Wang's wife, Ms. Yang, who was arrested at the same time as Wang, she was not included in the indictment, so she was ordered to be released by the judge yesterday.</p>

<p>Seeking Private Revenge with Knives and Clubs</p>
<p>The Assailants Are Being Apprehended One After Another</p>
<p>Ni Yougen, the chief of typesetting at the Zhonghua Book Company's factory on Jing'an Temple Road, had previously dismissed several workers who were not working hard enough, but had given each of them severance pay to help them make a living. However, Tao Shunbao and Xu Yunzhou, who had been laid off, were very dissatisfied and sought revenge. Recently, they were discovered to have colluded with workers Han Liuxiu and Li Qili, who were still employed, along with Liu Wenqing, Gao Haosheng, and others, either wielding iron bars or holding knives, and even some with handguns. They ambushed Ni on Ha Tong Road Fu Road and Ni's way to the factory. The group attacked him, causing Ni to suffer several injuries and fall to the ground in pain, before the assailants fled. Afterwards, the Jing'an Temple Police Station received a report and dispatched detectives Huang Yongji and Hu Zhiyun to the scene, where they took the injured man to the nearby Red Cross Hospital for treatment. They also arrested six people, including Tao Shunbao, one after another, and handed them over to the First Special District Local Court yesterday for investigation. Because Ni was still in the hospital and unable to appear in court, police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested a postponement, which Judge Wu granted. The defendants were ordered to be remanded in custody pending the injured party's recovery and further trial.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Gunshots on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Train <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>A Passenger is Wounded in the Right Chest</p>
<p>A Thug Falls and is Arrested</p>
<p>At 7:10 yesterday morning, on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train number 35, which departed from Hangzhou for Shanghai, a gunshot suddenly occurred in the carriage while passing through Xieqiao. The passengers were greatly alarmed. A passenger in the third-class carriage, about thirty years old, was wounded, with the bullet passing through his right chest. The conductor immediately ordered the driver to stop the train and took the injured passenger off the train to the waiting room at Xieqiao Station, where he was sent to the nearby Jiaxing Hospital for treatment on train number 36, which was traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou. It is said that his life is in danger. It was later learned that the train had passed near Yangqi outside of Xiaoshi, when suddenly a passenger, about twenty years old, jumped off the train, falling next to the platform, where he was injured. The railway police at the station, along with the local police, went forward to investigate and found a handgun and six bullets on the passenger. It is rumored that the thug who jumped from the train was a kidnapper, and the passenger who was shot in Xieqiao was the hostage. Others say it was a revenge killing. The injured bandit who jumped from the train and had a gun was sent to the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Death of Chen Zhangsheng</p>
<p>Chen Zhangsheng, a thirty-seven-year-old Suzhou native who lived on the pavilion floor at No. 14 Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, French Concession, was addicted to opium. Recently, due to the strict opium ban by the French authorities, he was detained and sent to the Second Special District Court on the 14th of last month, sentenced to one month in prison and fined thirty yuan. He was supposed to be released on the 17th of this month, when his family paid the thirty yuan fine, hoping that he would be released that day. However, it was not until yesterday (the 19th) that the release order was received. Unfortunately, Chen had contracted a severe case of typhoid fever after entering prison. At twelve o'clock yesterday, he was helped into a rickshaw by a prison guard. Before one hour had passed after he arrived at his home in Baoyu Lane, he died.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Hongkou Organizations Oppose Telephone Price Increase <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Another Letter to the Public Works Department Protesting</p>
<p>The Hongkou District Branch of the Citizens' United Association and the joint office of twenty organizations such as Yangshupu Han Bile Road, etc., are protesting against the telephone price increase.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>A Serious Protest to the Public Works Department. The original text is recorded below. During the January 28 Incident, the people of the entire port were under artillery fire and had no time to consider other matters, but the Shanghai Telephone Company discussed raising prices and dared to submit it to your bureau for implementation, freely increasing prices and disregarding the plight of the people. This is the first reason for opposition. Now, checking the telephone receipts, the price increase started in March, and it was secretly implemented without prior announcement, which is the second reason for opposition. Your bureau is the highest municipal authority in the Public Concession and should speak based on facts. In the autumn of economic depression after the war, how can you allow the price increase? This is a failure to observe, and the third reason for opposition. The prosperity of the market depends entirely on the transfer of productivity. Although telephone is one of the public utilities, checking the public utilities in the market should take into account common existence and co-prosperity. Your bureau's duty is to supervise and observe the market's prosperity or decline. Whether to increase prices should also be carefully considered based on facts and should not be handled rashly. This is the fourth reason for opposition. These price increase actions are all one-sided, and the company only seeks profit and does not care about public opinion. But how can your bureau disregard public opinion, rashly pass the price increase, treat taxpayers as nothing, and disregard the law, reason, and human feelings? In addition to notifying stores and users to pay at the old price before the negotiations are resolved, this letter is submitted again to request your bureau to reconsider and achieve a satisfactory solution to appease the people and relieve difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Same Trade Must Join the Guild <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Can Manufacturing Guild Telephones to Request Amendment of the Guild Law</p>
<p>The Iron Can Manufacturing Trade Guild yesterday telegraphed President Shao of the Legislative Yuan, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, stating: (titles omitted) National legislation must conform to human feelings, and effective implementation can be achieved. Otherwise, it is equivalent to no law, and even leads to abuses due to the law. The current Industrial and Commercial Trade Guild Law states that whether or not to join the guild is entirely up to the individual. As a result, the organization of trade guilds in various places cannot be soundly achieved. Those who join the guild are bound by the guild's articles of association and regulations, while those who do not join are free to operate, arbitrarily drop prices, and disrupt trade regulations. The guild is hindered by laws and cannot impose sanctions, so members of the guild are harmed. They will inevitably withdraw on the pretext of leaving, and the guild will disintegrate as a result. Therefore, the existence of trade guilds in name only is actually caused by the laws. The industry is extremely concerned. We are specially telephoning to request your consideration of the actual situation of industry and commerce and to amend the current Trade Guild Law as soon as possible. All businesses in any place that already have a trade guild organization should be required to join the trade guild as members, just as the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that trade guilds must join the Chamber of Commerce as members. This way, industrial and commercial products will not compete by arbitrarily dropping prices, but will seek progress by improving manufacturing technology. Otherwise, the collapse of industry and commerce will be imminent. If your lordships are concerned that the amendment of these regulations may lead to manipulation and monopoly by a few, then the local主管官廳, the highest party headquarters, and the superior chamber of commerce should be given as much close supervision and guidance as possible, and there will be no possibility of manipulation and monopoly. This telegraph is in urgent need of your attention and orders. (omitted below)</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Shanghai Shipping Industry Hopes to Settle the Yuan'an Charter Dispute <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Yuan'an charter of the Zhongwei Taiping Wheel has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, this reporter asked a certain person in the shipping industry, who said that Zhongwei is a purely Chinese-owned organization, so it can join the guild. Mr. Chen Shuntong is a talented person in our country's shipping industry. He and Mr. Zhao Yuntai of Yuan'an are usually very good friends. This time, Yuan'an proposed a declaration of war to resolve the dispute and entrusted the Shipping Association to arbitrate, which was also at Zhao's suggestion. At that time, the arbitrators Wang Bofen and Chen Ganqing repeatedly considered the arbitration process before making a fair judgment. Zhao's overturning of this case not only affects the credibility of the Shipping Association's arbitration, but also contradicts his chartering of the Taiping Wheel to operate in non-war zones after the September 18 Incident, while trying to terminate the contract on the pretext of releasing the mortgage. Now that both parties have resolved the matter legally, whether it is considered a formal declaration of war only needs to be inquired of the central government to obtain an explanation. At the beginning of the Ministry's efforts to recover shipping rights, it is hoped that Yuan'an and others will apply this spirit of contract dispute to the development of the shipping industry. This will not only benefit the country and facilitate transportation, but also promote the development of their own business. The Shanghai shipping industry, as its members, deeply hopes to settle the dispute peacefully based on arbitration and that Mr. Chen will also make some concessions to end the case as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Public Security Bureau Interrogates Reactionaries Yesterday <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>According to Hua Dong She, at 7:30 on Saturday morning, a large number of young men and women were holding a Congress of Representatives from various districts of the Jiangsu County Communist Party in the Gonghe Theater at the intersection of Rue Robert and Jiaozhou Road in Western Shanghai, planning for the Eighth International Red Memorial Day and participating in riots. The Sixth District discovered the meeting and the director, Zhang Mingqin, sent police to surround the building and arrest everyone. Because the case was serious, after a brief interrogation of the ninety-two people, they were transported to the headquarters in three large trucks, where Director Wen ordered the Third Section to handle the case. Here is an exploration of the interrogation yesterday:</p>
<p>The Investigation Is Still Underway. According to a gentleman from the Second Section speaking to Hua Dong She reporters, this case is of great importance. Although many perpetrators have been apprehended, there are still a considerable number of hidden and uncaptured people. Therefore, although the case has been interrogated for two days and there are some clues, it is still necessary to protect the progress of the case in order to investigate the remaining perpetrators to suppress the emerging chaos. The perpetrators are currently sitting under the shade of the trees in the outer courtyard of the Third Section. There are a total of thirty-four people dressed as short-sleeved workers, guarded by six police officers. They are summoned into the room for individual interrogation. Due to the heat and the large number of people, only half of them have been questioned from morning to 4 PM, and the interrogation will continue today.</p>
<p>Further Evidence Obtained. When the perpetrators were arrested, various reactionary publications and red badges were found on their bodies. Yesterday, after a more detailed inspection, action diaries and secret code telegram books, C·P· passwords, etc. were found. The Public Security Bureau is currently studying these items in detail.</p>
<p>Postponement of Transfer. Yesterday, the perpetrators in the case were scheduled to be transferred by armed police officers to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for handling. However, according to Wu Zhiqian, the chief of the Third Section of the bureau, this case is a political crime, and the conditions of martial law and special conditions of the Communist Party should be handled by the garrison headquarters. However, because the interrogation has not yet been completed and the case involves many people and many keys, the transfer is postponed. After continuing to apprehend key individuals, the cases will be handled together.</p>
<p>Bail Not Allowed. Zheng Fuzhen, the owner of the Gonghe Theater, was also arrested because he allowed the Communist Party to hold a meeting. The family claimed that he was innocent and unknowingly harmed, and united with nearby businesses to request bail. However, the Public Security Bureau believes that the case has not been fully interrogated. Although it has been proven that Zheng is a law-abiding merchant, he should also be punished for benefiting from stupidity. Therefore, bail is not allowed until the whole case is clear. However, for the sake of consideration, he is being held in a separate room and treated with courtesy.</p>
<p>Advocate Strict Handling. Hua Dong She reporters interviewed Wen Yingxing, the director of the Public Security Bureau, yesterday morning and asked about the case. He said that since the beginning of the month, labor strikes have occurred frequently in this port. Although this is a result of the post-war social abnormality, it has caused disputes between labor and capital. It is not without the Communist Party's instigation, which has made the already devastated situation even more chaotic in order to achieve their conspiracy. Now that the August 1st Festival is approaching, the reactionaries have been thinking about making progress for a long time. The people who have been apprehended have all been found to be the backbone of the Communist Party, who incite labor movements. Therefore, I am very pleased with this case, because the apprehension of a large number of perpetrators can eliminate many sources of chaos in public security. Therefore, because the number of people involved is large, the interrogation is being carried out in detail, and it has been decided to deal with it strictly.</p>

<p>Yang Fulang Killed During the War</p>
<p>The Corpse Still Hasn't Rotted After Nearly Half a Year</p>
<p>Yang Fulang, a resident of Yangjiazhai on the south bank of the Wenzaobang in Wusong, who is nearly sixty years old and makes a living by rowing a boat, on the second day of the lunar new year this year, the Japanese army planned to attack across the Wenzaobang with heavy troops in an attempt to occupy Wusong and were repelled by our army. The two sides fought fiercely in this battle, and bullets flew horizontally, as dense as raindrops. Yangjiazhai was right in the line of fire, so Yang Fulang dared not stay at home and fled from the hail of bullets to avoid danger. Unexpectedly, he was hit by two stray bullets. At that time, Yang still endured the pain and fled westward, but before he had gone far, he was exhausted and fell into the river and died. The body has not yet been recovered. The night before last, someone from the countryside was touching mussels by the bank of the river near Daxia Lane, west of the Yong'an Yarn Factory, when he touched a male corpse. The skin and flesh of the whole body had not rotted, but the clothes had been taken off long ago. Later, acquaintances identified the corpse as Yang Fulang's corpse and reported it to his son, Yang Ada, who went to identify it and confirmed it to be true. Therefore, yesterday morning, he prepared a coffin and collected the body.</p>

<p>The Hydrographic Office previously sent Mr. Gan Luqing on a surveying ship to Wenzhou Oujiang to measure the port. The work has been completed. It is urgent to publish a map of the waterway there for the fleet and ships to navigate. The bureau has submitted a request to the Navy Department to print and distribute the map, and the department has approved it. The map is designated as number 491, with a title in both Chinese and English. A total of three copies have now been released for sale, at a price of three hundred and thirty yuan each.</p>

<p>Su Youxi, the Shanghai representative of the Northeast National Salvation Army from Beijing, was thirty-three years old. At around 9 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, he was riding in his own car number 7267, driven by the driver Zheng Mulin, from west to east, passing through Hart Road. At that time, a tram number 68 from Route 1 was coming from the east. The driver Bao Ali was unable to react in time, and the two vehicles collided, causing the car to be largely damaged. Su and the driver were both seriously injured. A Chinese policeman number 439 saw the accident and immediately reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The two injured people were then sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Su died from his injuries at 5 PM that afternoon. The body was taken to the autopsy center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was notified and assigned prosecutor Guo Wei to come to the center to inspect the body. After taking his seat, he questioned Bao Ali, the driver of the tram, who said that he was thirty-four years old, from Suzhou, and lived at No. 26 Aiwen Lane, Hart Road. On that day, I was driving to Hart Road and saw two cars coming from the opposite direction, one behind the other. The car that caused the accident was originally in the back and wanted to overtake the car in front, so it accelerated and collided with my car. I was not driving fast at the time. After hearing a statement from Su's friend Liu Houwu, Guo determined that the deceased Su Youxi had indeed been injured and killed by tram number 68 from Route 2 before his death. The body was handed over to the friend Liu Houwu with a receipt to take back for burial.</p>

<p>The Jiufu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. held a shareholders' meeting the other day on the second floor of the company on Buck Road. The shareholders who attended the meeting were very enthusiastic. After publicly electing Zang Shouyu as chairman, the chairman reported that the number of shares and voting rights present had exceeded the legal quorum, and the meeting was opened according to regulations. First, manager Chen Xingwu reported on the business situation of the previous term. Chen Xingwu then stood up and said that after the company took over, it coincided with the repeated domestic and foreign incidents. First, there was the unprecedented flood, then the fall of the Northeast, and then the fall in the price of local products in Southeast Asia. The market was depressed and the financial system was blocked. Domestic businesses were almost all declining and shrinking. The company worked hard and, under the reform of business policies, the sales of various products have shown significant progress, which is very gratifying. Then, supervisor Li Zhengfu reported on the accounts and distribution of surplus. Then, the chairman reported on the new factory construction plan, saying that the company's products, such as Bainianji, Shengdan, Jiufu cod liver oil emulsion, and Buliduo, have been welcomed by people at home and abroad. However, the company's mission to inspire the pharmaceutical industry cannot be satisfied with this. Now that China's new medicine industry is on track, such as the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and the Pharmaceutical Business Management Regulations have been promulgated. It is urgent to expand the factory site and process and manufacture pharmaceutical raw materials, pharmacopoeia preparations, and injectable medicines. However, because the original site is insufficient, a site should be selected in the factory area to build a new factory, and the distribution office should be moved to the business area to facilitate the process. The factory director, chemist Shen Chuanhua, was asked to explain the plan for the construction of the new factory and the phased implementation plan for increasing production. It was approved by the shareholders, and the resolutions were passed. After the ad hoc discussion of several cases, the second supervisor was re-elected according to regulations. Ge Yanheng, Li Zhengfu, and Lu Mutang were still the most numerous and were re-elected, and Li Yipeng was the alternate supervisor.</p>

It also requested the military authorities to send an escort team, carrying machine guns, carbines, and box cannons, to deter bandits and ensure safety. Therefore, passengers on the Shanghai-Lake route can rest assured in the future.</p>

<p>The Weihua Advertising Company at the intersection of Majia Circle and Wuma Road in this port has recently expanded its business, and the original address is no longer sufficient.

In the future, all advertising business commissions will be handled at the new address.</p>

<p>A Letter to the Municipal Government Yesterday Inquiring About the City</p>
<p>The City Party Headquarters sent a letter to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "With deepest respect, we have repeatedly seen reports regarding the recovery of road construction rights beyond the border. The Government is proceeding with this matter, but what the content is, diplomatic secrets, there is no way to know the details. In the current international environment, when the situation is becoming increasingly worse, the great powers are conspiring to seek us, which is within our expectations. It is foreseeable that this Government is proceeding with negotiations to recover road rights at this time, its difficulty is imaginable, and its danger is also very clear. It is now decided by the 50th standing meeting of this association that the results of the negotiations be copied in advance before the negotiation of the recovery of road construction rights beyond the border is concluded or the agreement is signed, so that opinions can be provided at any time for adoption. I can't help but be eager. To the Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>

<p>Yuan Kang Domestic Marine Products Store, located at the intersection of Minguo Road and Fuyou Road in this city, has received a large batch of domestic frozen noodles (commonly known as agar-agar) produced by the Qingdao Taihe Factory, under the brand "Laoshan."  These noodles are of high quality and sold at reasonable prices, making them an ideal healthy food for both vegetarians and meat-eaters during the summer. The quality of these noodles is significantly different from the imported agar-agar that has been sold in the market. They are lustrous and jade-like in color, with the Laoshan trademark embedded inside and bound with white string, making it clear that they are entirely domestic products.  Many large native product stores are selling them in large quantities, which is truly good news for the promotion of domestic goods.</p>

<p>Recently, many people from all walks of life have favored Western-style suits for convenience. However, most Western suit items are imported, resulting in a loss of profits to foreign countries.  This urgently needs to be rectified. Mr. Zhan Jicai, the owner of the Pede Tie Company in this city, recognizing this issue, has established a large-scale factory specializing in the production of bow ties, ties, buttons, and other items, using entirely domestic materials.  These products are beautiful, durable, and affordable. Recently, they have introduced a new type of button called "128" to commemorate the national humiliation. It is reported that business has been very brisk at the company's main store on Nanjing Road and its branches on Sichuan Road and Haig Road.</p>

Recently, people from Singapore came to Shanghai and placed a large order with the factory.  In addition to adding machinery to speed up production, the factory is also operating around the clock to meet the demand.</p>

<p>Suicide is a tragic event throughout history and a puzzling case. The deaths of young people are becoming increasingly common. Hongye Jushi, with the compassionate intention to alleviate suffering, has written a new book, "The Truth After Suicide," in three chapters: (1) The Pain of Suicide, (2) The Truth About Suffering After Death, and (3) A Rational Judgment. The entire book uses profound philosophical principles to critique worldly ills, and every word is pertinent.

<p>Since the opening of the night shift for the city's ferry service, many people in Shanghai have been taking the ferry every night to enjoy a river cruise. Some passengers have suggested holding a weekly fireworks display at Gaoqiao Wharf to add to the enjoyment. However, it is reported that Director Huang of the Municipal Public Works Bureau has rejected this proposal because the area near the Gaoqiao City Ferry Wharf is designated by the municipal government as an oil depot area, and such an activity would pose a significant risk. Therefore, yesterday's foreign news reports about fireworks displays at Gaoqiao are absolutely untrue.</p>

<p>The Austrian Gaole Wax Paper, exclusively managed by the Yixin Educational Supplies Company on Fuzhou Road in this city, has no equal. The company's shipments in May and June have already been sold out. Ordinarily, it takes about twenty days to ship goods from Austria to China. However, due to the urgent demand from buyers and the company's pressing orders, the Austrian factory has expedited production. As a result, multiple shipments are being made this month, and a large batch will arrive in Shanghai within days. It is also reported that the company is committed to promoting domestic stationery products. Its original self-made paper, steel plates, iron pens, printing boxes, leather rollers, and various supplies for mimeographing are also selling well.</p>

<p>Wen Yingxing, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, has been hearing reports of subversive actions by reactionary bandits. Although the bureau's detective team and police officers in various districts have been conducting thorough investigations, the area is vast, and there are always gaps. Furthermore, with the recent labor unrest, there is a risk that reactionary elements may be lurking among the ignorant workers and taking advantage of them. Therefore, Bao Ziying has been specially appointed as the chief secret agent to assist Detective Team Leader Lu Ying in his work. It is reported that Bao is from Nanjing and has held important positions in the police forces of the Suzhou and Changzhou areas. He reported for duty yesterday.</p>

<p>The China Municipal Administration Advancement Association is organized by graduate members of the YMCA Municipal Research Society and advised by former leaders of the Municipal Research Society and municipal experts such as Bao De Kui, Dong Xiu Jia, Tao Le Qin, and Yan En Zuo. It had once prepared to hold a municipal exhibition at the end of last year. Municipal models from various cities in the country had been successively transported to Shanghai for exhibition. However, the exhibition was suspended due to the January 28 Incident, and the association's affairs were also halted. It has been more than half a year since then. Recently, Mr. Mu Zhijie, the executive director of the association, considering that the municipal administration of Shanghai has been greatly affected since the war, especially in the Zhabei area, and that various issues urgently need assistance and progress, hopes that all members will register at the temporary office of the association in the Intellectual Education Department of the YMCA at Baxianqiao within one week so that a general meeting can be convened regularly to reorganize the association's affairs and plan for progress together.</p>

<h3 id="e195">A Humble Opinion on the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan (Continued) Wu Jing Xiong <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Those who believe that the present is the best time to abolish taels and change to yuan think that the recent sharp drop in foreign silver dollars to 6 dimes and 9 cents means that people who receive silver dollars have invisibly reduced their income by 9%. Why not take this opportunity to abolish silver taels and set a standard conversion price of 7 dimes? If we don't act now, it will be difficult to implement it if the price of silver dollars rises again in the future (see the paper published by Mr. Zhang Naiqi in the "Current Affairs News" on July 12). This is certainly not wrong, but we must know that people who receive silver dollars have already reduced their income by 9% due to the sharp drop in the price of silver dollars. How much will it help to set a conversion price of 7 dimes to help them? If it is said that it prevents the price of silver dollars from falling further, then protection is added, but the current price of silver dollars and the actual value of silver coins are almost the same. If it falls further, silver smelters will be profitable and will compete to buy and melt it into silver bullion. Therefore, no matter what, the price of silver dollars will never fall below the actual value. This can be asserted, so why worry? According to the fact that the lowest price of silver dollars in the past could stand above 7 dimes, it was because the quality of silver coins at that time was better. For example, the actual value of foreign silver dollars was around 7 dimes and 1.5 cents, and foreign silver dollars were also outside of 7 dimes. When it came to Yuan coins in the third year of the Republic of China, the quality had already declined, but it was still worth above 6 dimes and 9 cents, so the price of silver dollars never broke the 7-dime barrier. In recent years, the number of coins minted by President Yuan has increased and the circulation has become wider, and almost all of the new coins are used in the market. However, the actual value is only about 6 dimes and 8.5 cents. The sharp drop in the price of silver dollars in the past six months, although it can be said to be due to economic decline, the difference in the quality of silver coins in the past and present is also an important reason. If we say that it is easier to set the conversion price at this low price of silver dollars, how can it be fair? The regulation of the conversion price must at least average the price of silver dollars in the most recent ten years, and then the compromise regulation can make the creditors and debtors no partiality to speak of, and the result of abolishing taels and changing to yuan is that the price of goods will rise, the cost of living will increase, and society will be seriously affected. We do not mean that society should not endure this temporary pain, but at a time when production is declining and all industries are in recession, there is no time to recuperate, so how can we give it a strong laxative? Is this the best time?</p>
<p>In short, the abolition of taels and the change to yuan are beyond reproach, and it is almost as unshakable as Einstein's theory of relativity. The gold standard of the Gammer Plan is unattainable. To retreat and think about the next best thing, the abolition of taels and the change to yuan is also enough to establish the foundation for improving the monetary system. Therefore, we strongly advocate the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, and we hope to see it come true as soon as possible. However, looking ahead and behind, there are many obstacles. If we are not careful, hundreds of coins will be created, causing endless harm. Therefore, we advocate that before the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, at least the following prerequisites must be met:</p>
<p>(1) Use diplomatic and legal methods to prohibit foreign merchants' banks from issuing banknotes.</p>
<p>(2) Unify the national issuing rights and stipulate full reserves (such as the Hong Kong government's method) and closely supervise them.</p>
<p>(3) Centralize the minting rights, determine the weight, quality, and free minting of the new standard currency, and ensure accurate quality.</p>
<p>(4) Compromise and regulate the conversion price of taels and yuan, so as to be impartial.</p>
<p>If the above four issues can be resolved one by one, then the abolition of taels and the change to yuan will naturally reach a stage where everything is ready and success is halfway there, and what could be better than this? Otherwise, a hasty attempt to achieve success will be counterproductive and will only lead to resentment. Moreover, if we suddenly announce the abolition of taels and the change to yuan today without any preparation, which of the dozens of hard and soft currencies will be used as the standard currency? Without first thoroughly reorganizing the national currency, how can we achieve the effect of abolishing taels and changing to yuan? If the weeds are not removed and the seeds are sown, it is difficult to get good harvests. Fellow citizens, please think about this!</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The puppet state sent a maiden petition group to the east to request recognition. The team leader is called Yu Ruolan! Since it is a Han surname, she must be a Han Chinese girl. Why did she become a representative of the puppet state? When I read the newspaper to this point, I said, "Wonderful, Yu Ruolan!"</p>
<p>Someone said: "This is not wonderful at all. What's so wonderful about it?" I said, "The matter is not wonderful at all, but the name is wonderful—only because the two words 'maiden' make up the word 'wonderful.'" Wonderful Yu Ruolan! Poetry comes all at once:</p>
<p>Wonderful! Wonderful! My surname is Yu, my name is Ruolan!</p>
<p>As a Han Chinese woman, she went over the wall! Women do the sides, —"West Chamber" becomes a female traitor, went to the eastern three islands to play!</p>
<p>Play, play, don't care if the graves of seventeen or eighteen generations of ancestors have collapsed.</p>
<p>Wonderful! Wonderful! Leading a maiden group!</p>
<p>Holding the geta under the dwarf's feet, shouting "Long live under your feet, long live under your feet!"</p>
<p>Recognize the Kwantung puppet state as an independent country in name as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Let those geta come and go alone!</p>
<p>Never again allow the one whose surname is Feng to occupy the sea, the one whose surname is Ma to occupy the mountain.</p>
<p>Wonderful! Wonderful! The maiden leader, a sprig of orchid!</p>
<p>Neither Hua Mulan who joined the army in place of her father, nor Su Ruolan who wove a celestial brocade!</p>
<p>Just a stinking flower, —a grass name</p>
<p>Impersonating a fragrant orchid.</p>
<p>Neither a valley orchid nor a nine-mu orchid!</p>
<p>This orchid, could it have grown on Pig Head Mountain?</p>
<p>Even if it didn't grow on Pig Head Mountain, it should have grown on a dung heap!</p>
<p>I call you, Yu, Ruolan!</p>
<p>I sigh for you, Alas! Ruolan!</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Flower Spear Money <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>When Mr. Wang Xingbo was about to leave for Suzhou, he told me the story of his martial arts teacher, Mr. Qian Wenming, who was known as "Flower Spear Money." After listening to it, I felt it was very strange, and now I am sweating and writing it out.</p>
<p>Native Place and Alias: Flower Spear Qian is from Qianjia Village in Zhenjiang. Because he used a good flower spear technique, and when he wielded it, it was as long as silk, as round as a full moon, and no wind or rain could leak through his body, others gave him the nickname "Flower Spear Qian."</p>
<p>Characteristics of Boxing Skills: Flower Spear Qian's boxing technique is of the Fu school; the characteristic of this boxing technique is that it is neither rigid nor soft. It does not have the two major drawbacks of the Shaolin school being too rigid and high-pressure, nor the Tai Chi school being too soft and without resistance; the wonderful part of the spear technique lies in the flexibility of the grasping of the yin and yang hands, and the strength is exerted in an instant without any effort.</p>
<p>Appearance and Anecdotes: Flower Spear Qian is tall and thin, slovenly, and walks as weakly as a patient. He often carries a three-foot-long copper-headed, steel-boned pipe; but on the outside of the pipe, there are densely twisted black silk threads; when he smokes, he only uses his mouth to slant and hold it without any effort, just like a wooden pipe. Therefore, in the eyes of a third party, he is just an ordinary weakling! But when something happens, he becomes as brave as a living dragon and tiger, and the pipe also becomes his protective weapon at the same time.</p>
<p>Appetite: Flower Spear Qian eats three liters of rice and two chickens and ducks per meal. His appetite is really big! Fifteen years ago, Mr. Wang often invited him to dinner, and his appetite was ten times that of an average villager; one night, he came to Mr. Wang's house when Mr. Wang and his family were about to finish eating. He was asked to eat with them, and the old gentleman was unceremoniously sat at the table, ate the meals of more than ten female servants that night, and even ate the entire Wang family's breakfast the next day. In the end, he still said he wasn't full!</p>
<p>Behavior, Age, and Family Background: Mr. Wang has not heard from Flower Spear Qian for more than ten years; it is said that this old gentleman is a poor but unyielding and non-productive big glutton, living a wandering life every year; he rarely gets sick in his life, and if he is sick, he only needs to meditate for a while, and then he recovers! He is now about eighty-three years old; he has a son, a nephew, and a nephew, all of whom have considerable inheritance; among the three, his nephew is especially outstanding!</p>
<p>Thoughts: After hearing everything about Teacher Qian, I expressed my admiration and my spirit was indeed greatly inspired; my love for martial arts was also tense. However, it is a pity that an old gentleman like this did not broadly teach disciples, nor did he study science, nor did he understand the modern situation, and could not further contribute a little to society, oh! Even if he lived to be eight hundred and three years old, he would only pass through the world casually!</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Shoe King Bata <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Juncao</p>
<p>Currently, the most famous "uncrowned king" in the industrial world</p>
<p>Naturally, it should be the American car king Ford. His thoughts, insights, and life have all been talked about. Here, I will introduce a European Ford - Bata, the shoe king of Czech Zlin. Bata's reputation in East Asia is not as loud as that of the Swedish match king Kreuger. But their unnatural deaths are the same. Bata's thoughts and opinions are exactly the same as Ford's. Their lives are also very similar.</p>
<p>Bata was born in the countryside of Czechoslovakia. His father was also a shoemaker. So he helped his father make shoes, deal with customers, and solicit business from an early age. At the age of eighteen (1894), he opened his own small-scale shoe store. But business was not very good. In 1904, he decided to go to the United States and France to learn new shoe-making and sales methods. After returning to China, he adopted Ford's mass production principles, increased efficiency, and reduced costs. In this way, his career became more prosperous day by day. During the European War, he specialized in making military leather shoes and earned a lot of money.</p>
<p>Bata has thirty-two shoe factories. Employing 17,600 workers. The daily output is 90,000 pairs of leather shoes. 40,000 pairs of rubber shoes. 4,000 pairs of bedroom slippers. Other special shoes 5,000 pairs. There are 1,946 issuing offices within the country. There are 153 abroad. The shoe market is not only all over Europe (except Soviet Russia). And as far away as the United States and Egypt. In addition to shoe factories, Bata also operates leather factories related to shoe manufacturing. Yarn factories. Textile factory. Rubber factories, etc. Therefore, the raw material cost of his products can be especially cheap.</p>
<p>The main reason for Bata's success. It is not the cheap raw materials. He pays special attention to the distribution of profits. Every worker is willing to take responsibility for himself. Because the distribution of profits is based on the work efficiency of each worker. Bata's treatment of workers. Just like Ford. There are free tutoring schools in the factory. Hospital. Movie theater. Dormitory. There are also cheap restaurants. Consumer society. Although the price of his leather shoes has dropped from an average of six yuan and six jiao to one yuan and five jiao. But workers' wages have tripled.</p>
<p>Bata's only hobby is aviation. He has many private planes. His use of airplanes. Just like ordinary wealthy people use cars. Five years ago, he was seriously injured when the wings caught fire and fell to the ground. If he had been safely inside this time. There would never have been four pieces of torn bodies. It can only be said that his fate was not good.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Two Impersonators of New Writers <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Laborer</p>
<p>The heat is unbearable. After dinner. With two or three close friends, cool off in the small courtyard. Talk freely about the past and present to use as materials for dispelling summer heat. Han Zizhiyuan. To describe two recent incidents of impersonating new writers in Jiaxing and Hangzhou. They are unique. Complementary. Makes people can not help but smile.</p>
<p>Fake Li Da in a Girls' School: There is a new writer in Shanghai. His name is Li Da. Many people know him. At the beginning of the autumn semester last year, Jiaxing Zhongshan Girls' Middle School. Accepted a letter of recommendation from a friend in Hangzhou. Hired a teacher of Chinese studies. On the first two days of the lecture. This new professor spoke eloquently. In front of the female students. Describe your history. He often said. I, Li Da. I have been studying new literature for more than ten years. Although I have reached the current position. Still feel dissatisfied. Because learning is endless. Therefore, I hope that all the students in the class will do this. Only then can we live up to the expectations of our parents and teachers. On one side, the books published by Li Da. Summary hook Xuan. Re-circle annotations. Distributed to students for reference. In less than a month's time. These Yingying Yanyan. This new literature professor was admired so much. The news spread outside for a while. All the schools have invited him to give lectures. Unexpectedly, two or three months later. Zhongshan Girls' Middle School authorities. Suddenly fired this writer. The students tried to keep him to no avail. There were also several days of strike threats. Some people say. Professor Li is really too pretty. The environment is not suitable for teaching in girls' schools. In fact, after investigation. This professor. Not Li Da. A journalist from Hangzhou. As for the meaning of his impersonation. Outsiders cannot know.</p>
<p>A Young Man in a Suit Impersonates Lu Xun: Lu Xun's name. More people in society know it. At a certain time. Suddenly a young man in a suit was found in Hangzhou. Full of thoughts. His hair was terribly long. And there was a very large black bow tie hanging in front of his chest. Full of artistic color. Every day, he must be alone. Carrying a stick to Lake Mountain Scenic Area for invitations. After the tour. Be sure to leave the six characters "Lu Xun was here" on the wall.</p>
<p>One day. A young man surnamed Yan. Unexpectedly, he met him at Hupao. Thinking that the opportunity was rare. Immediately went forward to express his admiration. The next day, he led more than a dozen friends who were fans of novels. To visit him at the hotel. At the same time, each person took turns as the host. Gathered in the restaurant for several days. Later. A writer from Shanghai. Went to the hotel to visit him. He unexpectedly gave him a cold shoulder. In the middle of the night, he blocked his luggage. Moved him away. The next day. A large piece of news was published in a Hangzhou newspaper. It roughly said that "Zhou Taisu, a primary school teacher. Impersonating the writer Lu Xun. Was discovered. Escape is unknown. " The common people disturb themselves. Events like this. It is too unconscious</p>

<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Suicide is a tragic event throughout history. It is also an eternal mystery. However, no one has ever fully revealed the secrets of this. This has led to confusion, and the truth is unclear. Today, the reason why suicide cases are increasing day by day. But no one can stop it. This is not to say that it is due to this. Hongye Jushi is based on the compassion of the world. Wrote the book "The Truth After Suicide." Based on academic principles. Citation is rich. It is called a masterpiece. The whole book is divided into three chapters. The first chapter talks about the pain of suicide. About the various pains of drowning, hanging, shooting, etc.. Detailed classification. All the talents are taken from the works of Western experts. Not comparable to building air out of nothing. Recently, young people. There is also a new and strange way of death. That is, lying across the railroad track to wait for the train to arrive and cut it into several sections. This is purely based on the biological principle of Spencer. It is extremely cruel. In addition to refuting this theory painfully. More Western new theories are cited. Interpretation of suicidal pain. To overturn scientific and old-fashioned thinking. The second chapter talks about the truth after death. Collection of facts at home and abroad. Proof of suffering after death. There are things that cannot be described in words. For example, what I have experienced in the Western clairvoyance and spiritual meeting. All filled as data. Bizarre and moving. The third chapter is a rational critique. With profound philosophy. Commenting on the evils of the world. Every word is pertinent. It can be called a prescription for the right disease. (Those who wish to read this book. Please write your name and address clearly.

<p>Letter from the Editor: After my manuscript "On Thrift and National Salvation" was published. Many letters have been received from various places asking for separate prints. I originally planned to have it printed immediately. Because there are still two paragraphs attached. One discusses that if we do not advocate loyalty and righteousness, we will not be able to obtain the 19th Route Army and the Northeast Volunteer Army in the future. It also discusses that the chastity of women and the righteousness of men cannot be separated. Modern people advocate breaking the concept of chastity. It is actually a fatal blow to social morality and personal integrity. It is useless and harmful. The second discusses that frugality and thrift should start from diligence and small things. It also discusses that in recent years, China has spread the extravagant and evil customs of the United States. It is the root cause of attracting foreign insults, losing land and humiliating the country. These two paragraphs have not yet been completed due to illness. Now, only the original manuscript will be published in bamboo. The rest will be printed separately after it is written. Anyone who wants to ask for the original manuscript. Please send a message to the Nie Family Speech Society on Liaoyang Road. Qi Jieqi.</p>

<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan</p>
<p>The world knows Zhu Qinglan as a philanthropist. It is also known that Qinglan was a military general. He was indeed a modest and refined gentleman with the demeanor of a famous scholar. When waiting for a position in Shenyang, before it had been changed to a province and the name of Shengjing was still in use, the Qing court had stationed a general to govern affairs. After General Zengqi left, Zhao Erxun succeeded him. Erxun valued his talent and appointed Qinglan as the leader of the patrol army, later promoting him to commander. He was transferred to Jinzhou. He accumulated wealth up to the rank of Daoist Priest. Before the Russo-Japanese War, the area was near the sea, and many people gathered there to avoid the conflict. Good and bad elements were mixed, making public order a concern. Qinglan supervised his troops day and night, patrolling and executing bandits immediately, then reporting to the general. Erxun complained, "Why not seek orders first?" Qinglan replied, "A general abroad is not bound by the ruler's commands, let alone those of a superior. The matter is urgent and should not be delayed. Therefore, I acted according to circumstances. I have not wrongly killed a single person. If any innocent person has been killed, Qinglan is willing to accept the consequences." Erxun said, "Just ensure that is the case, or I will hold you responsible." As a result, the territory under his jurisdiction was peaceful. Later, when Erxun supervised Sichuan, he recommended Qinglan as a commander, equivalent to today's division commander. During the Xinhai Revolution in Sichuan, Erxun's brother, Erfeng, was the governor and arrested and persecuted party members. Qinglan disagreed and requested to leave. A powerful figure in Sichuan, Yin Changheng, raised troops and killed Erfeng. Qinglan then left Sichuan under pretense and entered the Republic of China. Erxun praised him as more virtuous than the president and appointed him as the governor of Heilongjiang. His political achievements were remarkable. He retired, then returned to office as the governor of Guangdong Province. When the Southwest declared independence, he was not tolerated by the military governor Chen and resigned. Having served in Jinzhou for a long time, he settled there. In recent years, he traveled to several provinces, organizing disaster relief and saving people, rarely finding a moment of peace. The world views him as a philanthropist, and it is fitting without shame.</p>

<h3 id="e202">A View of Life: To Die Under a Peony <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>In this complex and chaotic social state, views on life are extremely diverse. Some see getting promoted and becoming wealthy as the purpose of life; others see gambling and eating as the purpose of life; some see becoming a hero as the purpose of life; some see becoming a famous scholar as the purpose of life; some see flattering as the purpose of life. In general, it can be said that each person has their own view of life, and there is no fixed definition. The ancient saying, "To die under a peony, to be a ghost and still be romantic," was originally a witty and satirical remark. However, in today's society, there are those who have created a new perspective, taking "To die under a peony, to be a ghost and still be romantic" as their view of life, which is truly a wonder of the world.</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have reported numerous cases of couples dying together in the Huangpu River or in hotels. It is truly passion to the extreme, passion even to death, continuing the passion after death. It is as if people are born with no other purpose than to "write love letters" and "talk sweet nothings," solely for the sake of "opening a company" and "sexual desire." Their entire lives are sacrificed for passion. The so-called "To die under a peony, to be a ghost and still be romantic" is truly astonishing. Just as yesterday's newspaper reported, the water police found the bodies of a young man and woman at the No. 16 buoy, embracing each other, with a belt tying them together. It was clearly a suicide due to lost love. The man was named Ruan Chengxun, and the woman was named Xu Juying, which is one example.</p>
<p>However, the use of "qing" (情, emotion/love) is broad. For example, parents loving their children is qing, and children being filial to their parents is also qing. Extending this to brothers, sisters, relatives, and friends, mutual affection is all qing. Does the meaning of qing only exist in these ways, and is there no qing outside of this? If that is truly the case, then the many, many lovers on the Fourth Road and on the Ni'ni Ying Road would all go to the Huangpu River to die, truly dying in droves. The ancients said, "To love is to want them to live, to hate is to want them to die." Now, they are doing the opposite, loving and wanting them to die. Does that mean hating and wanting them to live? Truly, people's hearts have changed greatly, greatly changed.</p>
<p>During the Warring States period, Queen Dowager Xuan of Qin had an affair with Wei Choufu. When the Queen Dowager was about to die, she issued an order: "When I am buried, Wei Choufu must be buried with me as a sacrifice." Wei Choufu was troubled by this. Someone persuaded the Queen Dowager for Wei Choufu, saying, "Do the dead have knowledge?" The Queen Dowager said, "No, they do not." The person said, "Your Majesty's spirit clearly knows that the dead have no knowledge. Why bury the one you love in life with a dead person who has no knowledge? If the dead had knowledge, the late king would have accumulated anger for a long time. How could he have had time for his affair with Wei Choufu?" The Queen Dowager then stopped the order. This story clearly shows that if one truly loves someone, one would never want them to die in vain. Even though Queen Dowager Xuan was licentious, she was still able to realize this.</p>
<p>To be even more straightforward, life is inherently empty, and death will come one day. If one must die anyway, there are many ways to die. For example, Jing Ke and Nie Zheng dying as assassins is one way to die. Tian Heng and Wen Tianxiang refusing to be slaves of a conquered nation is also a way to die. Xu Xilin, Xiong Chengji, Tang Caichang, and the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang dying for the revolution is also a way to die. Similarly, the soldiers who bravely resisted Japan this time and the righteous volunteers of the Northeast are also dying in a way. Like the Americans who flew around the world in eight days, and now someone wants to fly around the world in six days, that is also a way to die. All are sacrifices, all are deaths, but one is a death of great integrity, while the other is a death of filth and squalor, truly as different as Mount Tai and a feather.</p>
<p>The only problem people have is being greedy for life and fearing death. If one is not afraid of death, there is always a way. Therefore, sacrifice is not impossible, but it must be worthwhile and meaningful. Even the great heroes of the past were merely not afraid of death. If one dies simply for a woman, dies helplessly, it is truly foolish and useless.</p>

<p>— Shao Juan Chen</p>
<p>Due to business, I traveled south to Fujian and accepted an invitation from Mr. Lin Shouchang. Last night, I traveled from Beijing to Shanghai by train, passing through Kunshan and Nanxiang. Leaning against the window, I surveyed the battlefield, the dark moon and sparse stars, and the desolate scenery. I could not help but feel a mix of sorrow and emotion, so I composed two quatrains to express my feelings. In the hazy moonlight, the scenery is desolate and overgrown with weeds; ruined fortresses and remaining bee hives, a few willows stand. The small grass faces the wind, as if mourning; the bloodstains of loyal souls gradually blur.</p>
<p>Who is the enemy? Who is the friend? Wounds have not healed, yet another journey begins. Three things remain in my heart: aging parents, impoverished people, and the cries of ghosts.</p>

<p>Returning by sea, I saw the destroyed villages and towns of Wusong and Baoshan, all traces of war. How can one not feel emotion when one's homeland is in such a state? I wrote this to Zhizhu, Xueru, Jiaping, and other ladies, and also to Fanggu, Mingzhu, Peishan, and Peiheng.</p>
<p>The water stations and mountain towns are all destroyed, clearly showing traces of iron hooves. The light boat just passes Wusong, and again I hear sad tales of my homeland.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Marsh Gas Lamp <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>"Marsh gas" has been known since ancient times. It can be obtained from the edges of springs and ponds. The method is to stir up the sediment on the bottom of the water with a bamboo pole, causing many small bubbles to be released on the surface. These small bubbles are collected by inverting a glass cup over them. When the glass cup is lifted, quickly bring a flame to the mouth of the cup to ignite the gas, which will burn with a blue flame. This is the burning of marsh gas. It is now being used as a substitute for electric lights and fuel, known as natural gas lamps.</p>
<p>The chemical composition of marsh gas is methane. Its chemical formula is CH4. For experimental purposes, use about five grams of dry sodium acetate, mixed with an equal amount of sodium hydroxide and a small amount of lime powder. Heat the mixture in a hard test tube, and this gas will be produced. Its Western name is Methane. Because its two molecules are combustible, it produces a strong blue flame. Ordinary plant matter will also produce this gas when it rots in a place with insufficient air. The mud at the bottom of ponds also contains a large amount of decaying plants, so it will also produce this gas.</p>
<p>The method of using it to make natural gas lamps is to tightly seal vegetable leaves, rice bran, rice washing water, cow dung, etc., in an airtight underground cellar. Add clear water on top. After one or two weeks, the vegetable leaves, rice bran, etc., will rot and produce this marsh gas. Use a six-foot pole to stir it, allowing the gas to pass through an iron pipe. At the mouth of this iron pipe, place a safety lamp (i.e., a gauze-covered lamp) similar to a gas lamp to burn the gas, which can then be used as a substitute for electric lights. If the arrangement is changed to resemble the mouth of a pressure stove (different from a pressure stove in that one emits gas from a small tube and the other emits gas from multiple small tubes), then it can be used as a substitute for a pressure stove as fuel.</p>
<p>The burning of marsh gas can cause an explosion if it is carelessly mixed with air. Therefore, the installation of this natural gas lamp cannot be done carelessly.</p>
<p>Businesses engaged in this industry use cement cellars and measure the dimensions of the cellar, the amount of plant waste used, and calculate the amount of marsh gas that can be produced. They also specially manufacture a type of pressure gauge to measure it. The lamp head and iron pipe arrangements are all specially manufactured and sold after research.</p>
<p>There are many vegetable leaves, rice washing water, and other waste materials in the countryside. It is not easy to obtain them in the city. Therefore, this type of installation is suitable for the countryside. However, the cost of installing a cement cellar and iron pipe lamp head is very high. It is not easy for ordinary people in the countryside to afford such equipment, so it cannot yet compete with the power of electricity. Moreover, this type of installation has no secrets and cannot be patented. However, those who wish to install it should at least hire someone with knowledge of chemistry and craftsmanship to supervise the process, otherwise there may be danger or, even if there is no danger, it may not be economical. Caution is advised.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<h3 id="e206">Sick Car <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The avenue is filled with people and cars: trams, horse-drawn carriages, rickshaws, carts, trucks, cars with white license plates, and cars with black license plates. Coming and going, horizontal and vertical, crowded and packed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a car with a black license plate stopped, as if suffering from a sudden illness, unable to move. As a result, the cars behind had to stop as well, the first car, the second car, the third car, and so on. All had to stop. For a moment, the cars formed a dead dragon on the road. The tram was also stuck in the middle, ringing its bell incessantly.</p>
<p>Now, someone got out of the sick car with the sudden illness. The person was wearing a British-style suit, with trousers tapered to the extreme, yellow leather shoes, a stiff straw hat, and a mustache only two fingers wide below the nose. Based on these characteristics, we immediately knew that he was a citizen of the Great Empire. What was he doing? Of course, as usual, he checked the machinery. However, the sick car was not as easy to diagnose as he had hoped, so he became flustered. The road could not be blocked for even a moment, and the horns and bells behind him were ringing incessantly. Then, an Indian Sikh came, and onlookers also gathered. Of course, our Sikh could only shake his head. The only solution was to help the citizen of the Empire push the sick car to the side of the road so that the blocked cars could pass.</p>
<p>However, this was not the best solution, as the car could not just be left on the road, and he could not just stand there guarding it. He had to find a way to get it back. Finally, he had an idea. He called out to the idle people on the street, his Shanghai dialect so unskilled that it made people cringe.</p>
<p>"Hey, can a few of you come and push it back for me? I'll pay you."</p>
<p>But no one answered him. Everyone looked at him with a scornful smile and walked away. However, for the sake of money, someone finally asked him:</p>
<p>"How much will you pay each person?"</p>
<p>"To Gordon Road, two mao per person, okay?"</p>
<p>"Two jiao? From the avenue to Gordon Road? Bah!"</p>
<p>"Then how much do you want?"</p>
<p>"Five people, at least five yuan each, not a penny less!"</p>
<p>"Hahahaha!" Everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"Foreigner, bad guy, ignore him," someone said.</p>
<p>"Hahahaha!" Another burst of laughter.</p>
<p>After people had a moment of laughter here, they soon walked away. Foreign devil, killer of Chinese people, bad guy. Who would pay attention to him? This was also a kind of revenge.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Liva Lita Village <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Bei Lei</p>
<p>Like a carpet of fallen leaves, filled with the fragrance of flowers and fluttering shadows, with lingering music and elegant singing and dancing. Look! The wine is as fiery as fire, and the girls are as beautiful as flowers. Another world, a paradise on earth, this is the Shanghai High-Class Women's Summer Pleasure Gathering.</p>
<p>"High-class women," I don't qualify at all. I am just a low-class literary beggar. "Summer pleasure," is it necessary to eliminate the summer, and where does the pleasure come from? A silver dollar, like snow, menacingly guards the village gate. This is a gold-consuming place for capitalists and a place of wandering for the poor.</p>
<p>It was an extremely hot twilight. Yun came and insisted on inviting me to enjoy the scene. Suffering me, poor me, where would the money come from? What interest did I have in going? I refused, saying: The high-class women's pleasure gathering is definitely not a place for a poor scholar like me to go.</p>
<p>Yun was not angry. He said: Go, you must go, it is very interesting there, and there is a lady with the same name as you.</p>
<p>"Same name, really?"</p>
<p>"Who's lying to you?"</p>
<p>My curiosity was piqued. Finally, Yun paid the "toll" to enter. "Liang Garden is good, but it is not a place to stay for long." I don't know why, but when we poor fellows enter a place where the nobles gather and stand together, we always feel a little flustered. So, I was overwhelmed by their grandness.</p>
<p>Yes, the blue water rippled, and small boats swayed. The green trees were lush, truly a summer resort. How lively! How joyful! Men and women, in clusters, smiled with blooming faces.</p>
<p>Yun knew how to dance, so he went to the ballroom as soon as he entered the gate. He said that Mr. XX and Miss XX's tango was very exciting and should not be missed, and that the Miss with the same name as you could also be seen by the opportunity. Of course, if I didn't go with him, what would I do?</p>
<p>I had never been to a ballroom before. This time, I broadened my horizons.</p>
<p>Men, with lustful expressions on their faces, women, with grotesque and almost naked appearances, held each other tightly and danced madly. The smooth floor would make me unstable. Everyone was happy. The summer pleasure gathering lived up to its name.</p>
<p>I sat in the shade of a tree, looking around. I suddenly thought that less than half a year ago, this place, directly opposite, had the Toyota Textile Mill with enemy armored cars patrolling the area. My conscience made me ashamed. I discovered that everyone coming and going had lost all sense of morality. The Northeast was fighting so fiercely, but the people here with leisurely sentiments had forgotten everything.</p>
<p>I didn't want to watch anymore, so I ran away. I only realized that these people would only wake up after the country was destroyed. I deeply regretted coming here, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e208">Nanjing Road at Night <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Standing on the high floor of a certain building, I overlooked Nanjing Road at night.</p>
<p>Although it is night, under the illumination of countless electric lights, it is not only as bright as day, but also more brilliant and radiant than daytime.</p>
<p>Huge buildings stand in rows, regularly and heavily, separated by a road facing each other. The huge shadows stretched across the center of the road, like a giant beast opening its massive mouth.</p>
<p>The flowing groups of cars, the crowded trams, and the masses of people flowed like water on the road. No one was without a tense expression and a fighting spirit, as if they had heard the sound of a charge, rushing forward in a hurried and urgent manner... crowding. This is "life," this is "human society."</p>
<p>Among the hurried and urgent crowd rushing forward, the "strong" and the "weak" are even more evident. The strong often have a proud smile on their faces, often open their greedy mouths to devour everything, and often widen their greedy eyes, waiting for the opponent in the struggle, chasing after the docile lambs. The weak can only struggle helplessly, or hide in dark corners, stealing the leftovers of the strong.</p>
<p>Electric lights emit various colors of light from various buildings, especially the "red" color, which is particularly dazzling. The great "red" color is a symbol of blood, a signal of struggle, planted like fire on the highest peak of Nanjing Road, which is made of blood and flesh, giving mankind a great revelation.</p>
<p>The noisy sounds, rising with the flow of people, include laughter, cries, wails, and also mixed with roars of anger.</p>
<p>In the corners of the road, there are many enchanting eyes flickering, and many lips painted with rouge are whispering. The trembling breasts and swaying fat hips are calling out, "Come on, come on!" These are seductive shouts, also shouts of life, the enchanting is mixed with endless sorrow and strong resentment!</p>
<p>The patrolmen with killing handguns hanging diagonally stood in the center of the intersection, stretching out their two fingers to direct the vehicles and the crowds. Obviously, the order of this society is built on top of force. I wondered if this force would one day be seized by another group of people........</p>
<p>The night grew deeper. The "crowded people" were all resting temporarily, preparing the strength for tomorrow's struggles and competitions. The bodies of the weak remained on both sides of the road. The wide and long road also exhaled a deep, bitter breath from the day's fatigue.</p>
<p>Family Problems</p>
<h3 id="e209">Conflict of Old and New Minds <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>To my neighbors, the old Mr. and Mrs. Zheng, are a natural good match. They have two sons, who are already married. They also have three daughters, the eldest of whom is already married. The second and third daughters have not yet married, but they are already past the age of sixteen.</p>
<p>The eldest son and daughter-in-law, although only thirty years old, are a retired couple from the trend of the times. Their most peculiar habit is that they don't like to talk all day long.</p>
<p>However, the second daughter is a good mover with a new mind. She has also read for a few years. Every Sunday, she always strolls in the park with her lover—her fiancé—and her fiancé comes to her home every day. Their love can be said to have reached the boiling point!</p>
<p>The old Mr. and Mrs. Zheng are a naturally good couple, so they let their daughter move freely and are good at adapting to the trend!</p>
<p>However, the eldest son and daughter-in-law are a couple who have fallen behind the times. Of course, they don't agree with their sister's behavior and sometimes raise objections.</p>
<p>Because of the difference between the old and new minds, they have different opinions and have had several conflicts.</p>
<p>I remember once, because of some small things, the sister-in-law and daughter-in-law, who already had different opinions, quarreled. Of course, in a fit of anger, everyone revealed their dirty secrets. The chopsticks and tea sets were sacrificed. The old Mr. Zheng was so angry that he couldn't speak. The old Mrs. Zheng happened to be back in her hometown of Lingnan for something, so a full-fledged brawl was finally dissuaded by an old Mrs. Sun next door. However, the people watching the excitement had already crowded the doorway, and from then on, the family scandal was spread.</p>
<p>Black Curtain</p>
<h3 id="e210">Black Curtain of Indian Black Coal <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Black curtain events happen often, but in recent years, due to the high cost of living and the economic downturn, there are many black-hearted Indian black coals that are taking advantage of this opportunity to open their black curtain—lending companies—gathering unscrupulous followers to be communicators (i.e., commonly known as runners) to widely recruit debtors. Therefore, those who lack money, after hearing the sweet words of the runners, often join the debt group. However, once in the grip, Indian black coals use their usual tricks and procedures. The method is to deceive the borrowers into writing a fake IOU, writing one or two times more than the amount of money (this is a fixed procedure), writing the interest as one or half a cent, but in fact collecting eight or nine cents per month. At this time, the borrowers are half deceived by the Indian black coals and runners, and half oppressed by the economy. Although they know they are being deceived, they can only drink poison to quench their thirst and reluctantly write the note. When exchanging the silver dollars and the IOU, which differ by half the amount, the heavy interest for the first month is immediately deducted. The runner forcibly demands shoe money. In addition, this Indian man, using the qualification of creditor, often goes to the debtor's house to play, often engaging in various unscrupulous and lustful desires (such as rape, beating, scolding, demanding children, taking goods without giving money, claiming to increase interest, etc.). If the debtor dares to object, he immediately turns hostile and goes to the court to falsely accuse the debtor of not repaying the principal and interest, ignoring the guarantor, and using the fake IOU written out of helplessness at the time as a legitimate reason to request the court to recover the money. However, at this time, the debtor is like a patient who is terminally ill, unable to save himself or seek help, just like a terminally ill patient for whom even famous doctors are helpless. Is this not unjust? Those who have been deceived need not be remembered, but those who have not been deceived should pay attention.</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>In order to eliminate the summer night heat, modern men and women embrace and drive cars on the road, opening their collars and baring their chests, almost with the feeling of "pleasant masculine wind." At the same time, on both sides of the same road, many broken men and women lie sprawled, recklessly exuding a very strong smell of sweat, so that modern men and women have to cover their noses and pass by, even cursing fiercely, saying, "Disgusting filthy things! They should die, they should die." But the broken men and women also wave their big fists and say, "......One day will come, and we will clean up these dog men and women!"</p>

<p>Night is deep, and the toiling people drag their heavy bodies to the basement to rest from their extreme fatigue, but the people above them, pressing down on them, are reveling and dancing. A burst of endless music mixed with heavy footsteps shocks their nerves, so that they are constantly disturbed and cannot sleep. So they roar, "Curse your mother! There will be a time when we will completely overturn the foundation, and see if you can still have fun!"</p>

<p>A rickshaw puller pulled a large man to the door, wiping his sweat while reaching out his hand to accept his hard-earned wages, and begging repeatedly to add a little more. Sure enough, the big man said generously, "Okay, because it's hot, I'll give you one more copper coin."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wang was playing cards. Because the weather was too hot, in addition to the large electric fan rotating above her head, she also ordered the maid to fan her from behind. This made her feel cool. So the maid was covered in sweat, while the wife was full of coolness. So the maid was plagued by sleep, while the wife was extremely energetic.</p>

<p>The clock had already struck two past noon, and A Gen was still shaking the ice cream, shaking it again and again. His arms had already been shaken so sore that he had to stop to rest and close his eyes. But unfortunately, he was discovered by the young master, who had just finished smoking his opium. He stamped his feet and cursed loudly, "Damn thing, others are waiting to eat, but you are sleeping. In such a hot night, do you think you can sleep without eating ice cream?"</p>

<p>Civil Instructions: Shengqing Ji's application to collect funds is noted. Upon investigation, the case funds and litigation costs submitted by the accumulated affairs officer Huang Zhen amount to a total of 165 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 fen. The case funds and litigation costs submitted by Huang Wengu amount to a total of 55 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen. Both are kept on file for collection. Please come to the court at 8:00 AM on the 20th of this month to collect them. This is approved. De Gaoti's application to stop provisional attachment is noted.

This is approved. Wu Zheng Pan Zhaobang Certified Public Accountants report that creditors are requesting a temporary postponement of the disposition of Huang's assets. Please review the instructions for compliance. It is noted that the court's handling of the liquidation of Huang Chujiu's estate has been complex and unstable, and has not been completed to date. It should be actively handled in order to be completed as soon as possible. The auction of Huang Chujiu's real estate has also been repeatedly requested by creditors and debtors. The accountant stated that Dong Yu, a lawyer representing the creditors of the Gongfa Company, Ma Changji, and others, argued that due to the current commercial depression and financial stagnation, the disposition of real estate should be temporarily postponed, and that the lease and construction of houses should be preserved for the benefit of all parties. This is obviously contrary to the opinions of the creditors and debtors in this case, and it is also not the original intention of this court's active liquidation. It is difficult to approve. This is approved. Qin Binggen and others petition for the prompt execution of the auction of Huang Chujiu's estate, and request that the accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang be summoned to submit the case's deeds and securities. It is noted that the real estate of Huang Chujiu has been advertised for auction by this court, and the auction of the movable property is being handled. The request to summon the two accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang to submit the case's deeds and securities, and to order the two accountants to submit a written report on the liquidation of the case, is hereby approved. This is approved.</p>

If the association wishes to understand the circumstances of the case, it may attend the court hearings. The appointment of a lawyer to attend the trial and observe the proceedings is not in accordance with the law and is not necessary to discuss. This is approved.</p>
