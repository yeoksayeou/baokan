<h3 id="c1">康藏問題之緊急彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>東北之失。以其禍發也驟故國人無不爲之痛心駭目。同深悲憤。然而嚴重之康藏問題。遷延迄今。旣已兩年達賴格桑澤仁等承受陰謀者之發縱指使。舉兵入寇。兩年來蠶食鯨吞。即西康一省亦已失去十之七八。西陲半壁寖又將不爲我有。國人以道遠禍緩多不措意。或且尙不知有此事。事邊陲日急疆土日蹙。積兩年之長歲月。國人仍漠然無動於中。吁我民族其果爲睡獅耶。抑竟麻木不仁毫無感覺耶。</p>
<p>康藏以富饒之處女地。久爲强鄰所垂涎。禍機之潛伏已匪伊一朝。前年大吉喇嘛寺與白利土司遺産之爭執。即爲禍機爆發之導火綫。以故禍患一發。乃遂不可收拾迭經唐柯三特派員赴康調處。而達賴等恃有强大之奥援委。蛇反覆。交涉迄無結果。而入寇之師。仍邁進不已。本月五日本報載川康邊防總指揮劉文輝告急電文據云藏方德墨色代本新率勁兵約三千人到大奎寺。即將增上前綫而克代本又由向格一帶調集民兵五千餘人出發在途窺测現勢日内恐有激戰。「又云。」康區没落。即撤西屏。達賴狡預。非同小宼。川康勢等輔車。利害相關綦切。綢力支撑。豈敢告勞第以一隅當彼全藏。難操勝算。已屬必然」情勢之危急。已顯然可見。政府於邊防平日旣漫不措意。禍變旣發仍遷延時日積兩年之久。旣不急謀着後。復不明令撻伐。國家養兵二百萬。但知對内一旦外串猝起。則惶然無措東北旣已淪亡。此西陲之半壁河山。寗再容坐視其變易顔色耶。脫藏軍繼續前進不已西康旣陷。唇齒相依之川境。又寗能不爲侵略者進一步窺伺耶。</p>
<p>吾人認爲此一嚴重問題目前急待解决以國防言。固不容持久遷延。即以康民之長困於兵禍而言。亦不容再久置不决政府對於此事始終主張委曲求全。今旣受盡委曲而終不得全。徒陷無辜人民於戰禍茶毒之悲境。兩年來之失策亦已稍稍覺悟否耶。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者以我内政不修全國鼎沸。强鄰環伺。得機即逞。馴至門户洞開。早無國防可言東北不崇朝而全部淪亡西陲今又被　食殆盡舉目畺環顧禍患紛來。然而國内蝸角之爭持則正方興而未艾嗚呼我民族之大夢。果何時得以醒未乎。</p>

<p>國民社六日柏林電　今日德總統以命令發表國會改選期、定於七月三十一日舉行、按照德國憲法、國會解散後須於六十日内改選、今德總統不顧農黨所舉七月選舉妨害農收之反對理由、而定於七月末一星期日選舉、顯因欲畀新内閣在憲法範圍内較多自由施政之時日、</p>

<h3 id="c91">東北之謎Ｋ <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>（一）簡直是一齣喜劇</p>
<p>國聯調查團、已於六月四日入關了、我國代表顧維鈞、不顧日人之恫嚇與阻撓、毅然前往、亦竟安然完其責任而歸、四十餘日之艱苦工作、至此可暫告一段落、惟此行所得材料、整理尙須時日、現只提出幾個重要問題、寫以忠實的筆墨、使讀者對最近的東北、有一個大概的認識、</p>
<p>東北的現狀、簡單來形容、就是三千三百六十九萬七千七百多同胞、都被日本軍閥、强迫送入隔離病院、行動不許自由、每日由日本醫生和日本看護婦、施用手術和注射麻醉劑、使他們的心靈、在最短期間、逐漸衰弱而至於毫無知覺、直至七萬七千三百十方里的地方、完全日本化、成爲朝鮮第二而後已、</p>
<p>我到瀋陽的第二天、就去城裏過一次、由千代田通、行至商埠地邊界、有着藍色便衣的偵探、登車逐人搜查、有無携帶違禁品、兩旁有許多警察和商團、對面排列着、據日人宣傳、是防止顧維鈞走出附屬地的、商團着的是藍布制服、最惹人注目、以後沿路警察都站雙崗、且有荷槍背面立着的、經十一緯路和大西關大街而入大西門、門内也有警察商團和保案隊一大排駐守、保安隊的制服、和警察一樣是黑色、只不過多一白布人字式的肩章、這個小小肩章、倒也有一點歷史可述、從前是日本憲兵的印記和號數、這在調查團將到時才換上的、穿過東西華門、經過各衙門的前面、見省公署的門口、軍警狠多、敎育廳只開了半門、財政廳只開着半扇門上的小門、裏面也有兵守着、聽說各衙門以前都有日本某某機關的牌子、現在也除去了、後來又折到城内最繁盛的四平街、慢慢地沿街走去、才出小西門、經小西關大街而回至商埠地、見日本領事館附近、戒備最爲森嚴、幾乎是五步一崗、興盡歸來、已是萬家燈火、後來又繼續去過兩次、路線却綃有不同、第三次一觀奉天公園、理想的一個公共遊息的所在、誰知已在日本浪人指揮下、成了賭博之塲、喧囂不可名狀、攬轡亭雙門緊閉、玻璃花房、空空如也、只剩了外面幾株桃花、受着自然風露、還妍然的開着、園内地面高下不平、且有積水、穢氣中人欲嘔、想見此園無人過問、已非一日了、瀋陽所給我的印象、就是市面蕭條、商店閉歇的很多、與三年前所見的繁榮氣象、逈不相同、有些商店雖開着、却只是賣存貨、因爲商會出面干涉、不準隨意歇業、事後調查、才知道稍有血氣和潔身自好的人、此時都已他去、不然就是憤而投身義勇軍、甚至於當鬍匪、如我們同行的、有好幾位、曾在東北做過事、日人老實不客氣的對他們說、現在滿洲國需要人材、待遇很好、諸君皆是優秀分子、何以不在本地服務、由此看來、就是有人想閉户做寓公、恐怕日人不是利誘、就是威迫、也絶對不許們間散、其餘走不了的、可以分爲三類、一類是前任官吏、大都爲日人所刧持、無一個不在軟禁之中、一類是工農商、不是爲財産家庭所拖累、就是爲生計所逼迫、一類是無業遊民、混水裏好摸魚、樂得暫時耀武揚威、這些人各有心思、說是苟且偷安則可、若謂他們眞心和日本人合作、那就未免冤屈了、瀋陽吉林各大城、尤其是長春、一到晚間、便成了恐怖世界、七時起要檢查行人、八時商店一律關門、九時下卡（即關閉木栅）旅館小店伙房茶社澡堂理髮店和丙丁住房、都要逐一搜查過、其餘的人家、也有隨時搜查的可能、十時禁止小販呌賣、謂之凈街、夜間聽見槍聲、是一件尋常的事、一户不許異姓同居、如有親友往來、須先到附近警局、填明親友臨時户口簿、如發生事故、須由户主負責、此外每街又有所謂街長、要帮同警局巡邏、知有形跡可疑的人、應即秘密報告、否則查出法辦、鄰居和街長、都要連坐、四鄉則藉所謂聯村自治名義、實行十家連坐、十家設什長、五十家設閭長、二百五十家設村長、正一人、副二人、四村設聯村長、如此村容留匪人、圖謀不軌、或發起黨派、帶有政治色彩、彼等知情不舉、亦一律同罪、而且離城二三十里、又成了土匪世界、一般農人最可憐、有時牲口被搶去了、有時糧食被搶去了、有時連女兒也被搶去了、所以弄到有田無人耕、大家坐以待斃的景象、</p>
<p>瀋陽警務廳長、現已易爲日人、名三谷清、是以前日本憲兵城内分隊長、又遼寗省公署總務廳長、也由日人金井章次充任、一個總攬行政、一個總管公安、他們把實權握在手内、這是一個最顯明的證據、此外如國務院總務廳總務長官駒井德三、財政部總務司長阪谷希一、外交部總務司長大橋忠一、民政部總務司長中野琥逸、稅務司長源田松三、交通部總務司長大幸近男、鐵道司長森田成之、郵務司長藤田保明、司法部總務司長阿比留乾二、法務司長栗山茂二、及法制局長松木俠、吉林省政府總務廳長原武等、也都是最近發表的、至於下級官吏、更不計其數、這一班日本新貴、靦然無恥的、揚言採取屬地主義、在什麽地方做事、就是什麽地方人、其意就是他們所行所爲、日本政府不負責任、此外又有所謂自治指導員、派往遼甯各縣、少則一二人、多則四五人、最近又在東京考選大學畢業生百餘名、擬派往吉林和黑龍江各縣、他們都已改籍、且有換姓名的、他們的職權、在所做的工作報告書内、關於一縣的行政財政敎育商務買業農業和地方公安、幾乎無所不包、其性質那是指導、直是監督、但是日人還在欺瞞世界、未曾干涉内政呵</p>
<p>東北的交通機關、現在都在日人手内、所以當地只有日本人所辦的報紙可閱、關内報紙、無從入境、中文報紙只可說是日本報紙的譯本、因爲消息都由日人包辦、别無其他來源、至於外來的函電和出版物、都要經過嚴密的檢查、所以東北人士、不但對於關内情形、非常隔膜、就是對於本地情形、也可說是莫名其妙、現在日人最重要的工作、就是使在東北的中國人、個個孤立、尤其是和關内消息隔絶、不許有聯絡的機會、然後彼乃得隨意操縱、用中國人管中國人、用中國人殺中國人、而坐收漁人之利、所以對於一般做幌子的中國人、防範得格外嚴密、莫說發表意見、就是會客也不容易、生病時、規定要到日本醫院診治、惟恐他們和外界有秘密接洽、這次調查團到瀋陽、很想見見臧式毅等人、但是結果都未辦到、臧有日人横山正雄監視、寸步不離左右、所以就是能會到、也未必敢說一句眞話、我們曾約幾個當地舊友來談談、他們都未敢來、有幾個到大和旅館去訪友的中國人、事後都被逮捕、聽說其中姓張和姓齊的、至今還没有釋放、有時我們偶然和中國人在一起、想問問眞實消息、謹愼的總是不做聲、或是指指心、只敎我們會意、那種面面相觀的神情、想起來令人不寒而慄、以後我們也不再去看朋友、恐怕於他們生命和事業有妨碍、不過調查團已收到不少的重要材料、是由變個愛國靑年、冐險託外人轉交的、而且所引用的證據、都是從日本方面覓來、「以子之矛攻子之盾、」直令日人無詞可辯、日人除了新聞紙外、又會假造民意、淆惑衆聽、雇用無業游民、或稱商人代表、或稱農人代表、或稱報界代表、或稱朝鮮人代表、向調查團呈遞請願書、演了不少雙簧式的把戲、所以有人問美國委員麥考益少將、到關外有何感想、他微笑的答道、簡直是一齣喜劇、」此雖然是寥寥一語、而含意却很深、將來調查全般的結果、就是說「作如斯觀、」也未嘗不可、不過最可痛心的、此一齣喜劇、究竟演到何時、才能閉幕、日人用盡心機、造成此種局面、從表面看來、自然是躊躇滿志、但是東北今日、到處風聲鹤唳、草木皆兵、吃大家（就是貧民聚衆至大户强食）的風潮、已延蔓於海城通化各地、此種民不聊生道路以目的現象、恐將長久繼續、是日人之侵占滿洲、爲禍爲福、正未易言、幣原說得好、「吞東北如吞炸彈」或者要不幸而言中罷（六月四日山海關北寗專車上）</p>

<p>第二天早上我們和朱先生在師範學堂的會客室裏相見。那些客套話恕我不述了。我們把進城請先生的來意詳細細的說了一番。朱先生聽了。臉上現出很高興的樣子。他說，『你們先生和我找學校都不是容易的事。諸位一定感學到，有時是合得人意，合不得我意，合不得我意、合得人意。我在去年六月六日冩了幾首小詩。大家知道六月六日是呌做敎師節。我們做先生的人在這一天都要開會，討論先生們如何可以負起培養小孩子以創造新中國與新世界的重大使命。先生是應該如何做法？我那幾首小詩便代表了我的主張。請諸位看一看。若是大家贊成，我很願意下鄉帮忙；若不贊成，那也不必勉强。總之，我是在找一個能行主張的學校，也如同諸位</p>
<p>是在找一位合意的先生。』</p>
<p>我說：『朱先生！那是再好没有了。我來讀。不懂的請先生講。』宋老太和春生哥傾耳靜聽着：</p>

<p>市塲概况　今年以時局關係、往往發生夢想不到之意外消息、此次洋厘之墮跌、實屬亘古未有、滿期逐步恢復、以資運用、乃竟大悖不然、匪特不能回復、甚其江河日下、長此漫無制止、行見金融界有無事可爲之隐憂、各商業有無欵週轉之困難、誠商人之大不幸、今日夏節、銀錢業封關云、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　「洋厘」晨間人心變幻、形勢大軟、而賣户又復起勁、結果較前晨之最低價又小一厘有半、爲六錢九分四厘八毫七忽半、午市更爲危殆、復小八七五、爲六錢九分四厘、爲從來未有見聞之新低價耳、「銀拆」因銀根久鬆、頭襯豐富、故早午兩市之銀拆、始終白借、而劃頭亦無加水可言、</p>

<p>除日本有明顯反對表示外</p>
<p>其他均認爲解决不成問題</p>
<p>新聲社云、上海公共租界越界築路、最近經市政府與公共租界工部局雙方磋商之結果、據當局正式宣布、已達一相當階段、俟雙方分别向國民政府及滬領事團請示後、即可解决、政府方面、於接到此項報告後、將有一周密之考慮、同時領團方面、亦必有相當之研究、是以與公共租界有關係各國之態度、當爲一般人所注意、新聲社記者特向各關係方面探詢一切、茲將所得消息分誌於后、</p>
<p>英僑方面　英方以行政領事戴威森負此項事務之責、新聲社記者曾兩度前往造訪、均以該氏爲哈同遺産出席爲證人、未獲晤見、嗣以英僑方面、以英商會會長馬賽爾爲較有名望、該氏且曾爲圓桌會議事函領團、請從速召集、因逕晤於祥興公司據談、英僑方面、并無反對解决越界築路之意該事渠相信非領事團與中政府之事、欲謀解决、可由市長吳鐵城與公共租界工部局當局、直接辦理、將來如工部局必須待滬領團之集議考慮時、渠亦未準備有何建議、至大陸報載本人致函領團、請求從速召集圓桌會議事、渠以爲此亦屬一種公正之建議、蓋圓桌會議、并非單獨爲中日兩國之事件而開、其範圍係含有討論國際事件之性、即中國國民政府、亦宣布須討論滿洲事件、至所謂上海目由城等等、此說過於奇怪、余大不爲然、最後該氏表示、渠在滬已二十七年、對上海一切情形、均甚熟悉、此外并談論其他情形頗多、</p>
<p>其他各國　其他各國、除日本已有極明顯之反對表示外、餘均大體無甚意見、（一）美國方面、據行政領事穆秋談、渠關於越界築路之行將解决、尙未得其詳細内容、大約將先由中國與工部局方面自行决定、領團召集會議否、渠尙未有所聞、滬美僑對此、將抱何種態度、頗難說、要之、此路以中日兩方關係較重大、美方似無所不可也、（按上言係專指北四川路而言）（二）意大利方面、據公使館參贊洛斯表示、意方將取何種態度、渠尙不得而知、藎此事尙未經討論、渠意以爲此種小事、無討論與表示態度之必要也、（三）丹麥總領事羅恩、以爲此事無甚問題、當與其他各國同一進行、如召集領團會議、考慮此事、亦無如此之早、大約將由南京方面取决云云、</p>
<p>領團密議　國聞社云、關於越界築路問題、自市府與工部局接洽後、雙方均經議有具體辦法呈奉上峯請示、昨據確息、此項雙方議定草案、共計十六條、領團方面、日内正在秘密商議中、對條文頗費討論時間、聞本星期内將召集各國領事公開討論、以期早日解决、至我國方面、現正將草案原文、呈請審核、並聞於本週内可以交發公佈、</p>

<p>上海電話公司工人、昨日下午七時起、突然宣告罷工、昨晚七時以後、法租界及公共租界西區一部份電話不通、經修理後、至九時始完全恢復、全城通話如常、據工人方面宣稱、電話公司全體工人約三千人、一致參加罷工、其要求爲增加工資、改良待遇、戰業保障等項、至電話公司方面、則謂僅自動機間一部份工人罷工、於業務並無影響、且罷工工人、事前亦無何種要求及通知云、詳情分誌如次、</p>

<p>美貨運華增加</p>
<p>大陸報云、據最近美商部發表之貿易報告而觀、美國在滿洲之貿易、在實際上可謂開放之門户業已關閉、本年首三月間、美貨之輸往大連者、僅值美金二十九萬三千元、比去年同時期内所值美金四十五萬元减少百分之三十五、反之、同時期内美貨輸入中國（滿洲除外）者、共值美金二千零三十二萬七千元、比去年首三月所值美金一千六百三十萬元、增加百分之二十五、至美國進口貿易、本季概見衰减、因此中國本部輸往美國之貨物、比去年同時期内竟减少百分之五十八、僅值美金七百四十四萬元、（譯者按與進口美貨價值相較、祇及三分之一强、換言之、在中國方面入超竟達於出口值之兩倍、金錢如此外溢、安得不民窮財盡、望愛用洋貨者加以深切注意）惟由大連輸往美國者、獨比去年同時期增加百分之二十二、值美金三十五萬一千元、又查本年首三月美國全部對外貿易輸出、統值四萬五千九百十五萬元、比去年同時期减百分之三十四、（接對華輸出獨增百分之二十五）輸入總值美金三萬九千七百八十五萬元、以去年同時期減百分之二十九、（按對華輸入减少尤甚、竟减至百分之五十八、由此益可見中國對美輸出之不振也）、更查去年全年美國對外貿易總額比上年度减百分之二十五、在遠東方面比上年度减百分之十五、但對華輸出、連香港大連在内、增加百分之一、對華輸入、連香港大連在内、减百分之三十一、若就中國本部香港及大連分别統計、則去年全年中國本部方面輸入美貨、比上年度增百分之九、輸美華貨、减百分之三十三、大連方面輸入美貨减百分之六十六、輸美華貨、減百分之五十四、香港方面輸入美貨減百分之十八、輸美華貨增百分之九、其中美貨輸入大連香港者、雖頗見減少、但因輸往中國本埠之貨物、其價值遠過於兩埠、故合計之後、去年美貨輸華總值仍得比上年度增百分之一云</p>

<p>滬西眞茹區、當日軍佔據時、曾有鎭民沈頌　者、秉承日方意旨、組織維持會、甘爲傀儡、以是　人莫不側目、當上月二十三日我方接管委員前往接管時、同日下午、沈某突然失踪、此事迄今已歷多日、公安局方面、因據沈妻李氏報告、謂氏夫被綁、係屬該區保衛團所爲、因此局長温應星氏、曾諭令偵緝處人員、前往捕獲該團團員符鍾敏等、惟事後該鎭商民以被捕各人、係屬冤受不白、遂紛紛罷業援助此事、經該區保術團團正王守餘、市政委員洪蘭祥、於前日往市府保釋後、始得告一段落、惟漢奸沈頌閣之被綁案件、則尙未能水落石出、華東社記者、因於昨日特往眞茹方面剌探此事、茲將所得分誌如後　　漢奸被綁經過　據沈頌閣之妻李氏談、當夫被綁之時、彼猶卜居滬上、被綁時間、係爲二十三日下午一時、當時沈頌閣適在眞茹鎭北南陽宅寓中、並有一老僕陪同居家、被綁時、有該區保衛團武裝團員、並便衣團員數十人、先至沈寓、以借用門板爲由、繼見沈某在寓、乃即捕獲、即行押出、向東而行、當時沈之老僕見狀、情知不妙、乃往尾追、冀圖窺探究竟、詎行未數武、即被保衛團員拿槍喝阻、並聲言亦須拘捕、該僕不得已、乃立即步行赴滬、向其女主人李氏報告一切、</p>
<p>沈妻前往營救　沈頌閣之妻、自經老僕報告後、大驚失色、立即偕同老僕、由滬步行至眞茹、惟天已暝黑、至曹家渡時、因值戒嚴不能西進、乃躭擱於親友家一宵、至翌晨未明、乃復繼續前進、抵鎭後、初往市政委員辦公處、訪晤市政委員洪蘭祥、適洪赴滬未返、乃往該區保衛團團正王守餘、當將詳情報告、惟王對團員拘捕一事、堅决否認、當時並與李氏發生衝突、兩人不歡而散、李氏重行訪晤市政委員洪蘭祥、亦無要領、惟據李氏謂、當時洪委員曾表示、保衛團方面、决不出此謬舉、惟可以友誼的帮助、設法詳查、約定於三日後前往聽信、李氏不得已、</p>
<p>乃返滬寓、至三日後再往訪問、詎旣晤洪委員、仍無要領、不得已乃將詳情、報告該處公安局四區三分所所長石錦章、</p>
<p>報告市公安局　李氏之報告該管公安局、亦有原因、蓋當沈某被捕時、其老僕當時、曾追隨於後、一行蠭湧而出時、曾在眞茹車站畔、遇駐防該處之平保安隊、　沈　　　大呼　命、平保安隊　警、乃往　　惟保　　人員、　此係、們的事、可以無庸干涉、　　你們石所長、亦知道此事、故李氏乃往該區所報告、惟石所長對於此事、初未前知、不覺大異、當以茲事體大、命李氏親往公安局報告、温局長聆悉此事後、當以漢好雖屬可惡、惟地方人民、儘可羅列證據、呈控有司、何得私擅拘捕、遂根據報告、帶同證人、命偵緝處人員、亦往拘捕有關係人員、於是而釀成眞茹鎭罷市風潮、</p>
<p>四區三所報告　關於此事、華東社記者曾往該區四分區三分所調查、適所長石錦章外出、乃由劉巡官接見、據劉巡官談、當二十三日該案發生時、該所因接防伊始、初未知悉、旋經報告、乃由石所長往晤市政委員洪蘭祥、惟洪氏當時、諉爲不知、事後負責接防該區之平警、曾報告目撃此項事件、當時雖擬阻止而不得、故此事蛛絲馬跡、實甚可疑、該所方面現正嚴查此事、期得水落石出云、</p>
<p>一紙離奇廣告　此事發生後、沈頌閣之妻李氏、曾接到一綁匪之匿名函、函中聲明此事與保衛團無關、係被等弟兄所爲、如欲沈某安然返家、須出贖價三萬元、函中並聲明接洽方法、須依然來函中預擬之廣告刋登、李氏曾將此函、呈交公安局、經准許刋登廣告、惟於前日刋出後、初無一人、前來接洽、故沈之踪跡、仍無下落、此項廣告、字句頗離奇、茲錄如下「南陽筍乾公司收買眞正甜蜜醬啓事、如有上項貨色、務希將價額件數、以及接洽人姓名地點、詳細開明、函送法租界太平橋潤安里二號轉本公司可也、</p>
<p>漢奸寓所一瞥　沈頌閣之爲漢奸、固爲任何人所嫉首痛心、惟此次突爾失踪、亦殊令人莫明其妙、當沈某在傀儡組織時、曾將附近居民物件、强行攫奪、其寓中纍纍者胥附近居民所有、甚至曁大校舍中物件、亦被據爲己有、昨日記者曾往沈寓視察、沈宅門窗、已被居民搗毁頗多、門上且有車站上職員所貼封條、註明沈某如果回家時、不得擅行啓門、須與車站人員接洽、蓋此因沈某家中、藏有車站物件之故也、沈寓尙頗潔凈、蓋爲該區人民中之稍有積蓄者也、</p>

<p>— 賭廖</p>
<p>從前彼國某首相被剌以後，病臥醫院中，國人很抱着憂慮，尤其是一輩閣員，連日的前往問疾，大有山陰道上應接不暇之勢。好容易某首相放了一個屁，大衆便認爲病有轉機，不但以手加額，甚且舉香檳酒，吟詩一首誌喜。這是，曾見於海上報紙的，不過是那一年那一月的事，我有些模糊了，大概不算得相距久遠罷！</p>
<p>近來報戴某大將薨逝的時候，放屁三響，便斷氣了、同是放屁，却和某首相的屁，功效大不相同、某首相的屁，是病有轉機的先聲，某大將的屁，是病入膏盲的絶響，在這當兒，大概送終的人，不能以手加額了。益發不能舉香檳酒，吟詩一首以誌喜了，或者祭文上面可以用這「於屁三響，頓成絶響，嗚呼哀哉，伏惟尙饗！」的話頭。</p>
<p>我讀宋史，中國大忠良臨終的時候，呼渡河者三。我讀報紙，彼國大忠良臨終的時候，放屁者三。一中一外的忠臣，同是死在一個三上！我便可哼一句文言，呌做「嗚呼！此屁千古矣！」</p>

<p>金君得海者。山東人也。孔武有力。嘗怒捽人於十丈外。盜賊不敢正視其鄉。以卒伍起爲十九軍班長。每戰必創。創必重。曰非創無以見我之非怯。非重無以見我之勇也。江西剿赭宼。功尤著。倭宼我東北。君氣憤歐血。涕泣請出關。不聽復歐血、若中風狂。日縛草爲賊狀。持博刀。且詈且聽。必殘敗而復已。或規之。則怒曰。我血沸矣。不以殺賊。則有歐血死耳。雖然。我自不以有用血灑無用地。已而已而。我終當得處以盡我血耳。今歲上海變起令守廟行鎭。君喜躍。力請任前茅。疊有功。偶受創。懼爲醫士覺。將沮其殺賊也。私列裳裏之。三月一日。我軍撤淞防。羣起束裝。君獨蹲大壕中。不肯去。槍砲聲且近。趣之。泣曰。予胸腹已受七彈。即去亦不生。盍若在未死前復殺數賊乎。遂解儕輩大爆彈數枚偑之。並從容實槍。揮手高歌送軍行。軍退里許。猶聞餘聲激楚焉。聞者皆爲之流涕。而君竟不歸</p>
<p>王遞常曰。此吾門人何生毅生爲予言。生則聞之十九軍朱營長紫朝。君紫朝部也。紫朝言時猶泣數行下。謂失十地尙可復。失一士何可復也。悲哉。</p>

<p>遏止打鼾的機器睡後打鼾是一件很平常的事。但在歐美各國。却認爲可厭。美國的夫婦。竟有因打鼾而提出離婚的。也可見其對於打鼾深惡痛絶的程度了。於是發明家窮思極想。想出一種遏止打鼾的機器來。最近已向專利登記處登記。而得到專利權。這機器是一座傳音器。與無線電播音台中所用的傳音器很相像。不過小一些罷了。臨睡之際。將它較準。放在枕旁。以便與鼾聲相應和。到得睡熟以後。那鋸木似的鼾聲發作了。一聲高似一聲。愈打愈厲害。當時那傳音器也就老實不客氣動作起來。機中有一個電針會跳出來。剌在那打鼾者的身上。使他警覺。倘若不用電針。那麽也有方法。改爲輕微的獨電似的震動一下。而鼾聲也就終止了。</p>
<p>而說到那黑暗而又黑得令人依戀的中央公園。</p>
<p>中央公園，是在每一個靑年的心裏銘刻着深刻的印象的。那邊有繁花夾成的小道，那邊也有廣大的茶塲，更有那隠現着情侣的森林。當繁星在天空閃着鬼眼、瓦斯燈知趣地縮進樹葉的時候，</p>
<p>在中央公園的每一條脈膊上都有着山洪似的人羣在流着、他們都是帶着性的飢餓而來尋求他們滿足的對象。</p>
<p>嘴唇與嘴唇，肉與肉碰撃的聲音是隨時隨地都可以聽得着，尤其是那「不新，要有人來的·····」這種假意的拒絶，是最能挑彈人們的心絃，而使狂烈的顫蕩起來。</p>
<p>「上我家去坐吧？」「要末你上我家去。」「晚上不回去新嗎？」「今天不成」「·····」在這種歡樂的對白聲中，單零的人兒進來就變了一對兒出去了，一對兒一對兒的出去出云，出去做點什麽？這是誰都想得到。</p>
<p>可是遊園的人總不能那麽凑巧，所以一對一對去完之後，照例總要剩下些孤零兒，這些孤零兒是一個人進去還是一個人出來了。當他們走過修長的長安街，祗有一個影子伴着他。但是他們並不失望、因爲明天可以再來的，於是他們全都眼巴巴的期待着明天。</p>

<p>— 聶曾紀芬述男其杰撰文</p>
<p>昔大禹承洪水之後。卑宫室。惡衣服。菲飲食。而致力乎溝洫稼　開三代盛治之先河。亦千古秉政者之模範也。晋文公時。國人尙奢。公身示之以儉。宫室卑鄙。衣不重帛。食不兼肉。時人乃皆大布之衣。粗糲之飯。晋國以覇。衛文公當國破之後。大布之衣。大帛之冠。數年之間。再振國力。吳王閭閻。居不重席。食不二味。以成覇。越王勾踐。臥薪嘗膽。與士卒共苦。竟吞强吳。漢文帝禁止彫文刻鏤。錦繡纂組。郤貢獻。减太官。（主膳食者）省徭賦。一時循吏輩起。盛治稱三代後之最。宋仁宗力行節儉。屏棄珍物。而良將相之多爲宋代冠。時人有言。軍有韓范。虜騎破膽。韓范者。韓魏公。范文正。亦皆以廉儉刻苦爲世稱者。而其效乃能威振强敵也。清聖祖内衣。九日一澣。室中毡毯用四十年。平時食無兼味。故能於明末空虚之後。不務搜括。而盡除明代各種苛稅。雖經三藩回部緬甸之役。而人民樂棄。國力充富。迄於雍乾。共免全國錢糧八次之多。粤亂以前。并釐金而無之。其他積極事業甚多。如從西洋人親學天算。派員測定全國經緯度興圖。爲中國有正確與圖之始。又能親製發條自鳴鐘。及編成暦象考成。康熙字典。諸經纂傳等。鉅籍多種。其好學勤政而造成二百年太平之盛治。皆由其儉約克己之所致也。他如馬援立功交趾。以謙約節儉廉公垂誡。諸葛亮定三分業。以靜儉淡泊立敎。耶律楚材佐元太祖。軍行六萬里。兵威遠至印度西域。而布衣蔬食。神明淡泊。如處深山中。皆由其修養有素發爲事功也。</p>
<p>屬。咸舉以相屬。供其考訂。斯是種種。出自數百年蠧食塵封之餘。凌雜散裂。幾至不堪觸手。乃集合同志。分别綴緝、覓良工鄭重裝治。期於各從其朔。而不失其眞。並發篋陳書。一一排比參證。而後李氏六百年之歷史昭然若揭。史册之遺文墜事亦都得其歸宿。</p>
<p>遭時多難。作而復輟。半載以還。稍稍就緒。而李氏遺族之在明光原籍者。聞而馳書相訊。謂久聞其在北平之一支。藏有遺物。求之數十年渺不可得。一旦復公諸世。深以爲幸。是時朱氏亦於役南中。親赴岐陽故塋。履勘印證。愈覺李氏文物之卓有史學上之價值。一時南北羣彦。無不欣然。願寓目焉。此今茲公開展覽之所由來也。</p>
<p>故家遺物。所以不克長存。多緣寄托監護之不得其所。李氏子孫。雖蕭然在陋巷之中。而肯舉以供當世學者之研討。初不以之自私。其識度何可及。抑又進而有所佇望者。海内喬木之家。能從刦灰之餘。</p>
<p>收拾其先世文獻者。當尙不乏其人。須知時勢所趨。惟公開爲能傳之悠久。倘得聞風興起。進以裨國史之光榮。退以彰先世之潛耀。其爲盛美。豈復有涯。聲應氣求。當可翹足而待也。</p>

<p>昨據京訊，行政院將以戴季陶充蒙藏宣撫使，聞日内即將提出請中政會議任命之說，惟聞戴氏，近因用腦過度，身體不甚健康，假定宣撫蒙藏，必定親赴蒙藏，戴氏是否能跋涉長途，原是一個問題。</p>
<p>宣撫二字，在專制時代，早有此種名目，民國時代，亦曾經袁氏一度借用，惟宣撫二字的意義，原是宣布朝庭德意，撫慰人民生活之意，不知戴氏此次前往，拿什麽德意去宣布，用什麽方法去安慰，到是戴先生一個很重大的使命呢。</p>
<p>更有一個懷疑之點，蒙藏地方，遠</p>
<p>在數千里外，本來，凡隸中華民國版圖的人民，均應享有宣撫的權利，若是則江蘇一省，近在京畿，去年大水，今年大兵，人民困苦顚連，莫可告訴，而未聞政府挾有何種德意，前來安慰人民，殊爲遺憾。</p>
<p>近悅遠來，原是古人治國常經，現在政府僅注意遠來政策，而未曾想到近悅政策，舍近圖遠，恐亦是政府諸公智者千慮一失之故歟。</p>

<p>現在世界上的人，用腦的時候愈弄愈多，所以我人的腦子，也因之愈壞，末有食品或藥品的補助不興，但是各種食品，有否補腦質，或市上所售各種補腦藥水，何種含量較多，這是不是平常人所能鑒定的，所以現在鄙人把牠測騐和比較的方法，寫在後面，來做我人的參考，</p>
<p>測騐法先把要測騐的食品，溶在水中，或煎汁，然後把錏化鉬（Ammonium　molybdate）或硝酸銀（Silvernitrate）液，倒數滴入内，再摇幾摇，倘使有沉澱物，便證明内有補腦質，因爲補腦質的主要成分是燐質，牠在物中常和養氣化合而成燐酸根（Po4），但是燐酸根，和錏化鉬或硝酸銀碰着，便化合而成有色的沉澱物，所以倘使加入錏化鉬或硝酸銀液後，有沉澱出來，便證明内中有補腦質，</p>
<p>比較法把同體積的各種補腦藥水，各放在試管内，再各加錏化鉬或硝酸銀液，加後，各管都摇摇，然後再加藥水丨等到各管都不能再有沉澱出來爲止乃末看各管的沉澱多而濃的，補腦質便多，因爲在同體積内，有更多的補腦質和錏化鉬或硝酸銀化合而生沉澱，</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Emergency of the Tibetan Issue <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The loss of the Northeast was so sudden that the people of the country were heartbroken and shocked, filled with deep sorrow and indignation. However, the serious issue of Tibet has been delayed until now. For two years, Dalai Lama Gesang Zeren and others have been manipulated by conspirators, raising troops to invade. Over the past two years, they have been nibbling away like silkworms and swallowing like whales. Even the province of Xikang has lost seventy or eighty percent of its territory. The western half of the country is gradually ceasing to be ours. Because the people of the country consider the road to be far and the disaster to be slow, many do not pay attention, or may not even know about this matter. The border is becoming more urgent every day, and the territory is shrinking every day. After two long years, the people of the country remain indifferent and unmoved. Alas, is our nation truly a sleeping lion? Or are we simply numb and insensitive?</p>
<p>Tibet, as a rich and untouched land, has long been coveted by powerful neighbors. The hidden seeds of disaster have not been sown just in a day. The dispute between the Da Ji Lama Temple and the Baili Tusi over inheritance the year before last was the fuse for the outbreak of the disaster. Therefore, once the disaster erupted, it became impossible to control. Special Envoy Tang Ke San was dispatched to Tibet to mediate. However, the Dalai Lama and others, relying on powerful support, repeatedly betrayed trust like snakes. Negotiations yielded no results, and the invading army continued to advance. On the 5th of this month, this newspaper reported that Liu Wenhui, the commander-in-chief of the Sichuan-Kang border defense, sent an urgent telegram stating that De Mo Se Daiben of the Tibetan side recently led about 3,000 elite troops to Da Kui Temple and was about to reinforce the front line. Moreover, Ke Daiben mobilized over 5,000 militiamen from the Xiangge area and set out on the way, spying on the current situation, fearing a fierce battle within days. "It also said," "If the Kang region falls, then Xiping will be evacuated. The Dalai Lama is cunning and unpredictable, not like ordinary bandits. The situation in Sichuan and Kang is like interdependent cartwheels, with closely related interests. We strive to support it, but how dare we complain of hardship? It is inevitable that we will not be able to win with only one corner against the entire Tibet." The urgency of the situation is already clearly visible. The government has always been negligent about border defense. After the disaster erupted, it continued to delay for two years. It neither urgently sought countermeasures nor issued a clear order to suppress the rebels. The country supports an army of two million, but only knows how to deal with internal affairs. Once external troubles suddenly arise, it is at a loss. The Northeast has already fallen. Can we allow this western half of the country to sit idly by and watch it change color? If the Tibetan army continues to advance and Xikang falls, how can the Sichuan border, which is as close as lips and teeth, not be further coveted by the invaders?</p>
<p>We believe that this serious issue urgently needs to be resolved. In terms of national defense, it cannot be delayed any longer. In terms of the long-term suffering of the people of Kang from the scourge of war, it cannot be left unresolved any longer. The government has consistently advocated seeking complete peace through compromise. Now that it has suffered all kinds of compromise and still cannot achieve complete peace, it has only plunged innocent people into the tragic situation of war and suffering. Has it finally realized the mistakes of the past two years?</p>
<p>Moreover, our internal affairs are not well managed, and the whole country is in turmoil. Powerful neighbors are watching, seizing opportunities as soon as they arise, until the door is wide open and there is no national defense to speak of. The Northeast was completely lost in less than a day. The western border is now being eaten away. Looking around, disasters are coming one after another. However, the internal squabbles are just beginning and have not yet subsided. Alas, when will our nation's great dream be awakened?</p>

<h3 id="e2">Chiang Kai-shek Goes to Wuhan to Supervise the Suppression of Communist Bandits <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Departed from Nanjing Last Night at 5:40 PM</p>
<p>Chiang is on the "Yingrui" Warship, with the "Yongsui" Escorting Behind</p>
<p>The Military Forces of the Three Provinces Have Been Deployed Separately</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek was originally scheduled to take the "Yingduan" warship to Wuhan before 4 p.m. However, Luo Wengan came to see him, saying that Gu Weijun would arrive in Nanjing soon and requested that Chiang wait a little longer. Chiang therefore changed his departure to 5:30 p.m. A telegram from Wuhan said that Li Zhonggong had arrived in Wuhan before Chiang. Today, someone personally saw Li Zhonggong, and only then did they know that the person who went to Wuhan a few days ago was Chen Xizeng and his entourage. Li did not go with them. The date of Li Jishen's departure will be determined after Chiang sends a telegram. Before Li departs, he and Zhu Peide will be jointly responsible for the affairs of the Military Affairs Commission. After Li departs, Zhu will be fully in charge as an agent. (7th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Before Chiang's departure, the Naval Department ordered the "Yingrui" and "Yongsui" warships to fire up. Chen Shaokuan personally went to the warships to take care of matters and summoned the captain of the "Yingrui" warship, Lin Yuanquan, and the captain of the "Yongsui" warship, Yan Shouhua, to give instructions. The "Yingrui" and "Yongsui" warships were docked at the Jiangxin Pier in Sanbei. At 4 p.m., Chiang's 60-member guard team arrived first and boarded the "Yongsui". At about 5 p.m., those who came to see him off arrived one after another, including Gu Mengyu, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Yi, Gu Zhenglun, Wu Siyu, Huang Bingheng, Zhou Yawei, and Fang Juehui, who boarded the "Yingrui" warship. At 5:25 p.m., Chiang, accompanied by Soong Mei-ling, Gao Lingbai, Wang Shihe, and eight attendants, arrived at the riverside. Chiang was dressed in casual clothes and walked into the Sanbei Pier, then boarded the Naval Department's motorboat to the "Yingrui" warship, shook hands with those who came to see him off, and bid farewell. Only Soong Mei-ling and Wang Shihe accompanied him. The "Yingrui" warship departed westward at 5:40 p.m., with the "Yongsui" warship escorting behind. Gu Mengyu and others returned to the city after the ship set sail. (7th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Before Chiang went to Wuhan to supervise the suppression of bandits, he had ordered the military forces of the three provinces to be deployed separately. The troops of Hu Zongnan, Tang Yunshan, Wang Jun, Zeng Wanzhong, Chen Diaoyuan, Xu Tingyao, Song Shike, etc., in Anhui have already contacted each other and are advancing. The troops of Chiang Dingwen, Chiang Fusheng, Li Mo'an, etc., stationed on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway will also go to assist in the suppression one after another. The military forces of Henan and Hubei provinces are also fulfilling their respective tasks. (7th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Affairs Commission is preparing to establish a Military Medical Supervision Committee, consisting of seven members. The Director of the Health Department, the Director of the Military Medical Department, and four others will be ex officio members. The remaining three will be appointed by the Military Affairs Commission. The Director of the Health Department will concurrently serve as the Chairman of the Committee. After being submitted to the National Government for approval, it can be established before the 15th of this month. (7th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changsha) He Jian will personally go to Wuhan to present and discuss military and political affairs after Chiang arrives in Wuhan. (7th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Renlin, the Director-General of the Lixing Society, flew to Wuhan by plane on the 7th to arrange everything in advance, as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was about to depart. (7th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Xiao's Troops Reach Jingshan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>He and Duan's Bandits Flee North and South</p>
<p>Ma Dengying Goes to Yingcheng to Supervise the Suppression</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to news from the Pacification Headquarters, Xiao Zhichu's troops, Wang's Brigade, and the 1st and 2nd Supplementary Regiments reached Jingshan on the 5th. He and Duan's counterfeit 7th and 8th Divisions fled north and south. Also, Zhang Wanxin's division captured Changjiawan in Mian County on the 5th, killing many bandits. (7th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chiang telegraphed He Chengjun on the 6th, saying that the Red Bandits were causing disturbances, destroying the rural system without anything left. The property of the people was all used to fill the bandit treasury. Good people were afraid and fled, and many vagrants were driven to serve. There was no smoke in the villages, and the fields were all barren. It was heartbreaking to eat. In the future, whenever lost territories are recovered, it is essential to treat and comfort them well and exempt those who were coerced from being implicated. He ordered all the troops to strictly abide by this. (7th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Ma Dengying went to Yingcheng on the 7th to supervise the suppression. (7th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Pacification Headquarters decided to hold a meeting on the 9th to discuss the transportation of bandit suppression supplies. It was decided to start with the troops responsible for defense and suppression in the area east of the Pinghan and Xiangdan Railways. Those summoned to attend included the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, twelve provincial governments such as Guangji, three Public Security Bureaus such as Wuxue, and five chambers of commerce such as Songbu.

<p>Three Provinces Join Forces to Suppress the Peng Bandits</p>
<h3 id="e4">Aircraft Bomb Bandit Nests in Longgang <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Changsha) The joint suppression of the bandits by Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi is still under the charge of He Yingqin. (7th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The command headquarters of the bandits on the borders of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi was located in the old nest of Longgang. On the 3rd, He Yingqin sent several planes to drop more than ten 120-pound bombs, destroying many bandit organizations and killing a large number of bandits. (7th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Jiangxi Eastern Police Force Jointly Suppresses the Fang Bandits <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Two certain divisions have arrived in eastern Jiangxi. The provincial government ordered the police forces of more than 20 counties in eastern Jiangxi to concentrate on jointly suppressing the Fang bandits in Hengfeng.

<p>Japan's Proposal to Establish a Governor-General in the Northeast</p>
<h3 id="e28">Ministry of Foreign Affairs Temporarily Remains Silent <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>If Implemented, They Will Report to the League of Nations and Request a Stop</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter visited a high-ranking official in diplomatic circles to inquire about his opinion on Japan's establishment of a Governor-General in the Northeast. According to him, the Japanese in the Northeast have always had what is known as the "politics of four giants," namely the Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, the Commander of the Kwantung Army, the President of the South Manchuria Railway, and the Consul General stationed in Shenyang. Each of these four giants has independent responsibilities and does not interfere with each other. Therefore, Japan has long had plans to establish a position similar to a Governor-General to achieve administrative unity. Recently, the Saito cabinet formed, and Nagai took office as the Minister of Colonial Affairs and actively planned this matter. If this is true, then the steps taken by Japan are completely the same as annexing Korea, regarding the Northeast as its colony. This infringes upon the integrity of our territorial sovereignty and violates the Nine-Power Treaty and the resolutions of the League of Nations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently observing the situation, but if it materializes, there will be a serious statement and a report to the League of Nations requesting a stop.

<p>Military Commission Asks the Control Yuan to</p>
<h3 id="e33">Send Personnel to Supervise the Payment of Military Salaries <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Control Yuan Asks the Headquarters to Send Staff Officers and Adjutants to Supervise Salary Payments</p>
<p>Division and Brigade Commanders Deny Levying from the People</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan previously stated that regarding the salaries of the various divisions and brigades suppressing bandits, the Ministry of Finance said that they had been paid, but lower-ranking officers and soldiers had not received them, resulting in them constantly levying from the people, even oppressing the people near the bandit areas. On the contrary, the people were displaced due to the army's conscription. The Control Yuan sent a letter to the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, pleading on behalf of the people. Chiang replied, asking the Control Yuan to send ten Supervisory Committee members to the various divisions to supervise the payment of salaries, so as to verify the facts. The Control Yuan stated that the locations of the various divisions and brigades were different, and the travel expenses for each committee member to go would not be covered, so they declined to send them. They sent another letter to Chiang, asking the Headquarters to send a staff officer and adjutant to each division to supervise the salary payments to prevent the division and brigade commanders from taking kickbacks. Subsequently, the Military Affairs Commission stated that, as far as levying from the people was concerned, division and brigade commanders were not directly involved, and they usually relied on local county magistrates and chiefs of public security bureaus. The county and police personnel were poorly selected, and some even used the supply of troops as an excuse to levy taxes from the people. The Control Yuan should recommend talented county magistrates and chiefs of public security bureaus so that the appointment could avoid extorting money from the people. This matter has not been resolved to this day. According to the reasons given by the division and brigade commanders, for example, a Class A division receives a monthly salary of 150,000 during peacetime. However, when they are mobilized, everything such as transportation, supplies, and additional manufacturing and travel expenses increases almost twice as much as usual. The Ministry of Finance issues salaries according to peacetime amounts, which can only be used for transportation, supplies, and the addition of clothing and equipment. As a result, the monthly salaries of soldiers in the various regiments, battalions, and companies are often not paid, or they are not paid in full. Over time, the various divisions and brigades owe a lot of back pay to their soldiers. As for levying from the people, not every division does this. Newly established troops and incorporated troops, as well as troops fighting in war zones, sometimes raise funds from the local area, but the government has always prohibited this and has not tacitly allowed or let things go. In the future, if any troops directly levy salaries from the local area, they can complain to the Military Commission, which will definitely deal with them severely. As for planting opium in various defense areas, it is mostly a matter of understanding between local officials and the army, and this should be discussed separately. (7th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Gesang Zeren went to Kang region to announce local autonomy. Some said he was a rebel, others said he was colluding with Tibet, and still others said he was sent to Xikang by the Central Party Headquarters, and that there were frequent telegrams between them. After investigation from Yunnan, it was learned that Ge was dispatched to Xikang by the Central Party Headquarters to organize party affairs. Three-quarters of Kang territory has already been occupied by Tibet. The remaining dozen or so counties are occupied by Liu Wenhui's troops, who conscript laborers and force the planting of opium. Some party members have been arrested and killed. After Ge arrived, he gained the support of the local people and resolved a portion of Liu Wenhui's troops. Ge has no connection with the Tibetan side, and is solely dealing with the problem of Liu Wenhui's troops' behavior. Those who said Ge was a rebel a month ago were mostly from Liu Wenhui's side, because Liu had a representative in the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, which also issued a news report about Ge's rebellion. The current government and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission have proven that Ge is not a rebel, but is merely making things difficult for Liu Wenhui. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways has approved the Ministry of Interior's letter forwarding its opinion on reorganizing the national water conservancy administration. The Ministry believes that in the past, the established regulations for river management involved stationing high-ranking central officials along the rivers, with overall control residing in the Ministry of Works. The proposed National Water Conservancy Bureau by the Ministry of Interior would have the same status as the former Ministry of Works, and the six regional water conservancy bureaus would be equivalent to the former River and Canal Commissioners, somewhat resembling the stationing of high-ranking central officials along the rivers. Not being subordinate to the provincial governments would facilitate command and ensure unimpeded progress. These opinions have been sent to the Ministry of Interior for reference.

<p>The Four-Headed Political Unification Plan Gradually Takes Shape</p>
<p>The Commander of the Kwantung Army Is Changed to a Governor-General System</p>
<p>With a Director-General of Political Affairs Below to Manage All Administration</p>
<p>China United News Agency, 7th Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held an important meeting at 6:00 p.m. today, attended by Vice Minister Arita, Director of the Asian Affairs Bureau Tani, and various bureau directors within the Ministry, to discuss the Four-Headed Political Unification Plan for Manchuria proposed by the military. It is reported that the opinions within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are not yet consistent. The so-called plan of the military has five main points: (1) A Governor-General is to be appointed, to be held by an army general, concurrently serving as the Commander of the Kwantung Army, unifying the administration of various agencies in Manchuria. (2) Below the Governor-General, a Director-General of Political Affairs is to be established, in charge of political affairs other than military affairs. (3) The Kwantung Government is to be reduced to a local administrative agency. (4) Consuls-General and consuls are to be placed under the jurisdiction of the Director-General of Political Affairs, with a Foreign Affairs Department established to handle matters related to diplomacy. (5) The South Manchuria Railway Company is to be governed by the military Governor-General, carrying out various industrial matters under the Governor-General's instructions.</p>
<p>Dentsu, 7th Tokyo Dispatch: The issue of the Four-Headed Political Unification of Manchuria will be rapidly concretized after President Uchida goes to Tokyo and the special session of the Diet adjourns. As for the Governor-General, it will be held by a general, and the Chief of Staff will be held by a lieutenant general. The names of General Muto Nobuyoshi for the position of Governor-General and Lieutenant General Ueda Kenkichi for the position of Chief of Staff are highly mentioned. Nagata Hidejiro, who has no political affiliation, is being considered for the position of Director-General of Political Affairs.</p>

<p>Reuters, 7th Paris Dispatch: The declaration of the new government of Herriot was read in the Chamber of Deputies today. It was entirely a general discussion and did not clarify the overall European situation, because the European situation depends entirely on the attitude of France toward the issues of reparations and disarmament. The declaration indeed speaks of international peace and goodwill and has the intention of mediation for reparations and disarmament, but it is still linked to France's safety and treaty rights. It also declared that the government is prepared to discuss any plan that tends towards greater world security (this implicitly contains the intention of reaching out to Germany). As for disarmament, France agrees to all solutions that do not endanger its national security. France's army budget expenses will soon be reduced. Finally, it said it will help the people in difficulty together with other countries.</p>

<p>Papen's Cabinet Has No Intention of Dictatorship</p>
<p>Rumors of Restoration Are Pure Fabrication</p>
<p>Once a Prisoner, Now Minister of Labor</p>
<p>National Society, 6th Berlin Dispatch: Today, the German President issued an order announcing the date for the parliamentary reelection, set for July 31st. According to the German constitution, a reelection must be held within sixty days of the dissolution of parliament. Today, the German President ignored the reasons against the election in July raised by the Farmers' Party, which argued that it would interfere with the agricultural harvest, and set the election on a Sunday at the end of July. This is clearly because he wants to give the new cabinet more time to govern freely within the scope of the constitution.</p>
<p>Reuters, 6th Berlin Dispatch: Before the German general election, the Papen cabinet will continue to govern. According to resolute statements from government officials, Papen has absolutely no intention of implementing a dictatorship policy. Hitler's National Socialist Party is now intensifying its work, hoping to win a majority of seats in parliament. The party already holds a majority in various provincial parliaments.</p>
<p>National Society, 6th Berlin Dispatch: Today, Berlin officials are extremely outraged by the shocking news spreading abroad, such as rumors that revolutions have broken out in several places in Germany, that the government has mobilized troops to quell the unrest, and that news is being censored. They claim that such shocking news, as well as previous rumors of royalists plotting a restoration, are all groundless. The current German government is a constitutional government and has no intention of violating the constitution. The fact that the date for the parliamentary reelection is still set within the time limit stipulated by the constitution can be seen as clear evidence, and President Hindenburg is definitely not someone who would violate his oath and betray his trust. Having sworn to protect the constitution, he will be able to carefully adhere to his oath and protect the republic during his term. In addition to this semi-official statement from the German authorities, a major British news agency also issued a formal statement today, stating that it is not responsible for the reports in several London newspapers that armed revolutions have broken out in many places in Germany, stating that it had inquired with the news agency's Berlin office, which replied that it was absolutely unfounded.</p>
<p>National Society, 6th Berlin Dispatch: Scheff, the Director of the German Federal Insurance Bureau, was appointed today as Minister of Labor to complete the entire cabinet. Scheff was previously a director of the Krupp artillery factory. During the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, he actively organized passive resistance and was sentenced by a French military court to imprisonment and forced labor for twenty years, but eventually escaped to the unoccupied area and continued to resist.</p>

<p>Reactionary Elements Take the Opportunity to Become Active</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior Is Preparing for It</p>
<p>China United News Agency, 7th Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese farmers presented a request to the Diet, the content of which was a proposal to extend the principal and interest repayment of all rural debts by three years. Yesterday, it was unanimously approved by the Petition Committee of the Lower House. It is reported that the Upper House also expressed its approval. The question is what attitude the government will take towards this proposal. However, most of the beneficiaries of this proposal are landowners. Tenant farmers are demanding more thorough relief measures, and their momentum is spreading throughout the country. The situation is shifting from a petition movement to direct action. The Japanese Ministry of Interior then ordered local officials across the country to conduct strict investigations into whether there are any communist elements participating in it. If any overstepping actions occur, they should be immediately detained and punished.</p>
<p>Reuters, 7th Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese parliament is now focused on dealing with the matter of relieving agricultural districts, especially in northern Japan, which is urgent. Farmers there are in dire straits, and tens of thousands of people will starve. It is heard that the Army Ministry is extremely afraid that this will affect morale, because 88 percent of the Japanese army recruits come from agricultural districts. A delegation of farmers has petitioned the Diet to allow them to suspend loan payments and implement</p>
<p>relief measures. The authorities are very troubled because the machinery of reactionary and radical parties are taking advantage of the current hardship of farmers to</p>
<p>incite incidents in order to overthrow the current system of governance.</p>
<p>Reuters, 7th Tokyo Dispatch: Members of parliament concerned with the issue of providing relief to farmers today passed a resolution advocating that the government convene another special session of parliament within two months, dedicated to passing legislation for fundamentally reorganizing people's debts, especially in rural areas, and promoting national industries.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Mystery of the Northeast K <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>(1) Simply a Comedy</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team entered customs on June 4th. Our country's representative, Gu Weijun, disregarding Japanese threats and obstruction, resolutely went and safely completed his mission and returned. The arduous work of over forty days has come to a temporary end. However, the materials obtained from this trip still require time to organize. Here, I present a few important issues with honest writing, so that readers can have a general understanding of the recent Northeast.</p>
<p>The current state of the Northeast can be simply described as follows: 33,369,700+ compatriots are being forcibly sent into isolation hospitals by Japanese warlords. Their freedom of movement is restricted. Every day, Japanese doctors and nurses perform surgery and inject anesthetics, causing their minds to gradually weaken and become unconscious in the shortest period of time, until the area of 77,310 square li is completely Japanized, becoming a second Korea, and only then will they stop.</p>
<p>On the second day of my arrival in Shenyang, I went to the city once. From Chiyoda Street, going to the border of the commercial district, blue-clothed plainclothes detectives boarded the vehicle and searched each person for prohibited items. There were many police and merchant corps lined up on both sides. According to Japanese propaganda, this was to prevent Gu Weijun from leaving the concession area. The merchant corps wore blue cloth uniforms, which were very eye-catching. Later, police along the road were stationed in double posts, with some standing back-to-back holding guns. We entered the Daxi Gate via 11th Wei Road and Daxiguan Avenue. Inside the gate, there were also large rows of police, merchant corps, and security guards stationed. The security guards' uniforms were black, like the police, except for a white cloth "人" (person) shaped shoulder patch. This small shoulder patch has a bit of history to tell. It used to be the mark and number of the Japanese military police. This was only changed when the investigation team was about to arrive. Passing through the Dongxi Hua Gate, we passed in front of various government offices. We saw many soldiers and police at the entrance of the Provincial Government Office. The Education Department only had half of its door open. The Finance Department only had the small door on half of its door open. There were also soldiers guarding inside. I heard that all government offices used to have signs of some Japanese agency, but they have now been removed. Later, we turned to Sipin Street, the most prosperous street in the city, and slowly walked along the street before exiting the Xiaoxi Gate and returning to the commercial district via Xiaoxiguan Avenue. Near the Japanese Consulate, the security was the most strict, almost one post every five steps. I returned, having enjoyed my fill, when thousands of lights were lit. Later, I went twice more, but the routes were slightly different. On the third visit, I took a look at Fengtian Park, ideally a place for public recreation. Who knew that under the command of Japanese ruffians, it had become a gambling den, with indescribable noise. The gates of the Lǎn Pèi Pavilion were tightly closed. The glass greenhouse was empty. Only a few peach trees outside were still blooming beautifully, exposed to the natural wind and dew. The ground inside the park was uneven and there was standing water. The foul smell made one want to vomit. It was clear that no one had taken care of this park for a long time. The impression that Shenyang gave me was that the market was depressed and many shops were closed. This was very different from the prosperous scene I had seen three years ago. Some shops were open, but they were only selling their existing stock, because the Chamber of Commerce intervened and did not allow them to close down at will. After investigation, I learned that those with a bit of integrity and who valued their reputation had already left at this time. Otherwise, they had angrily joined the Volunteer Army, or even become bandits. Several of our companions had worked in the Northeast before. The Japanese bluntly told them that Manchuria now needed talent, the treatment was very good, and they were all outstanding individuals, so why not work locally. From this, it can be seen that even if someone wanted to close their doors and live in seclusion, the Japanese would absolutely not allow them to do so, either through enticement or coercion. The rest who could not leave can be divided into three categories: one category is former officials, most of whom were kidnapped by the Japanese and were all under house arrest; one category is workers, farmers, and merchants, who were either burdened by property and family, or forced by livelihood; one category is unemployed vagrants, who were happy to stir up trouble and temporarily show off their power. These people all had their own thoughts. It can be said that they were苟且偷安 (passively content with the present situation), but it would be unfair to say that they genuinely cooperated with the Japanese. Major cities in Shenyang and Jilin, especially Changchun, became a world of terror at night. Starting at 7 pm, pedestrians were checked. At 8 pm, all shops were closed. At 9 pm, the "ka" (wooden barriers) were lowered, and inns, small shops, kitchens, teahouses, bathhouses, barber shops, and 丙丁-grade housing (low quality) were searched one by one. Other households were also subject to random searches. At 10 pm, street vendors were prohibited from hawking, which was called "净街" (cleaning the streets). Hearing gunshots at night was a common occurrence. No household was allowed to have people with different surnames living together. If friends or relatives came to visit, they had to first go to the nearby police station to fill out a temporary household registration form for the friends or relatives. If an accident occurred, the head of the household would be responsible. In addition, each street had a so-called "street chief" who had to help the police station patrol and secretly report anyone with suspicious behavior. Otherwise, they would be punished if discovered. Neighbors and street chiefs would be held jointly liable. In the countryside, under the guise of so-called "joint village autonomy," a ten-household responsibility system was implemented. Every ten households had a "什長" (section chief), fifty households had a "閭長" (village head), and 250 households had a "村長" (village chief), one regular and two deputies. Every four villages had a "聯村長" (joint village head). If bandits were harbored in the village, plotted wrongdoing, or initiated political parties with political overtones, and they knew but did not report it, they would all be equally guilty. Moreover, 20-30 li away from the city became a world of bandits. The general farmers were the most pitiful. Sometimes their livestock was robbed, sometimes their food was robbed, and sometimes even their daughters were robbed. Therefore, the situation reached a point where there was land but no one to cultivate it, and everyone sat and waited for death.</p>
<p>The chief of the Shenyang Police Department has now been replaced by a Japanese man named Mitani Kiyoshi, who was previously the leader of the Japanese military police city squad. In addition, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Liaoning Provincial Government is also filled by a Japanese man named Kanai Akitsugu. One controls the administration, and the other controls public security. They hold the real power in their hands. This is the most obvious evidence. In addition, the Chief of the General Affairs Division of the General Affairs Department of the State Council, Komai Tokuzo, the Chief of the General Affairs Division of the Ministry of Finance, Sakatani Kiichi, the Chief of the General Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ohashi Tadaichi, the Chief of the General Affairs Division of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Nakano Koitsu, the Director of the Tax Bureau, Genda Matsuzo, the Chief of the General Affairs Division of the Ministry of Transportation, Oyuki Chikaoto, the Director of the Railway Bureau, Morita Shigeichi, the Director of the Postal Affairs Bureau, Fujita Yasuaki, the Chief of the General Affairs Division of the Ministry of Justice, Abiru Kenji, the Director of the Legal Affairs Bureau, Kuriyama Shigeji, and the Director of the Legislation Bureau, Matsuki Kyo, and the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Jilin Provincial Government, Haratake, etc., have also been recently announced. As for lower-level officials, there are countless of them. This group of new Japanese nobles shamelessly claim to adopt the principle of territorialism, meaning that wherever they work, they are people of that place. The intention is that the Japanese government is not responsible for their actions. In addition, there are so-called "autonomy instructors" who are sent to various counties in Liaoning, with at least one or two people, and up to four or five people. Recently, more than 100 university graduates have been selected in Tokyo to be sent to various counties in Jilin and Heilongjiang. They have all changed their nationality and even changed their names. Their duties, as stated in their work reports, cover almost everything concerning a county's administration, finance, education, commerce, business, agriculture, and local public security. Their nature is not guidance, but direct supervision. However, the Japanese are still deceiving the world, saying they have not interfered in internal affairs.</p>
<p>The transportation agencies in the Northeast are now all in the hands of the Japanese. Therefore, only newspapers run by the Japanese can be read locally. Newspapers from within the pass (China proper) cannot enter. Chinese newspapers can only be said to be translations of Japanese newspapers, because the news is all monopolized by the Japanese and there is no other source. As for incoming letters, telegrams, and publications, they must undergo strict inspection. Therefore, the people of the Northeast are not only very isolated from the situation within the pass, but they can also be said to be completely clueless about the local situation. The most important task for the Japanese now is to isolate every Chinese person in the Northeast, especially to isolate them from news from within the pass, and not allow them to have any opportunities for contact. Only then can they manipulate them at will, using Chinese people to govern Chinese people, using Chinese people to kill Chinese people, and reaping the benefits of the fisherman. Therefore, they are especially vigilant against the Chinese people who are just acting as figureheads. Not to mention expressing opinions, even meeting guests is not easy. When they are sick, they are required to go to Japanese hospitals for treatment, for fear that they will have secret contacts with the outside world. When the investigation team arrived in Shenyang this time, they very much wanted to meet with Zang Shiyi and others, but in the end they were unable to do so. Zang was monitored by the Japanese man Yokoyama Masao, who never left his side. Therefore, even if they could meet, they might not dare to tell the truth. We asked a few old local friends to come and talk, but they did not dare to come. Several Chinese people who went to the Yamato Hotel to visit friends were arrested afterwards. I heard that among them, those surnamed Zhang and Qi have not been released to this day. Sometimes, when we were accidentally with Chinese people, we wanted to ask about the real situation, but they were always careful not to speak, or they would point to their hearts, only instructing us to understand. That kind of look of mutual consternation was chilling to think about. Afterwards, we no longer went to see friends, for fear of harming their lives and careers. However, the investigation team has received a lot of important materials, which were entrusted to foreigners by patriotic young people at great risk. Moreover, the evidence cited was all found from the Japanese side. "Using your own spear to attack your own shield," leaving the Japanese speechless. In addition to newspapers, the Japanese also fabricated public opinion to confuse the public, hiring unemployed vagrants, calling them merchant representatives, farmer representatives, press representatives, or Korean representatives, to submit petitions to the investigation team, putting on a lot of farcical plays. Therefore, someone asked the American Commissioner, Rear Admiral McCloy, what his impressions were of going to the Northeast. He smiled and replied, "Simply a comedy." Although this is a few words, the meaning is very profound. In the future, the overall result of the investigation can also be said to be "viewed in this way." However, what is most heartbreaking is how long will this comedy last before it closes? The Japanese have exhausted their efforts to create this situation. From the surface, they are naturally complacent. However, in the Northeast today, there is an atmosphere of panic and suspicion everywhere. The trend of "eating the big family" (poor people gathering and forcibly taking food from wealthy households) has spread to Haicheng, Tonghua, and other places. This phenomenon of people not living and being dead (desperate poverty) will probably continue for a long time. Whether the Japanese occupation of Manchuria is a disaster or a blessing is difficult to say. Shidehara (Kijūrō) said it well: "Swallowing the Northeast is like swallowing a bomb," and perhaps it will unfortunately come true. (On the special train from Shanhaiguan to Beining, June 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Battle Situation on the Hu-Hai Railway <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan's Troops Gathered in Hailun</p>
<p>Japanese Army Focused on Advancing from the Qike Railway</p>
<p>Li Haiqing's Army Retreated to Duiqingshan</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: The battles on the Hu-Hai Railway have had no official contact in recent days. The Japanese army entered Suihua on May 27. Most of their troops, the Hiraga Brigade, set up their brigade headquarters in Suihua City. On the 30th, they advanced from Suihua along the railway to Hongqibao, 40 li north of Suihua. They are currently confronting the Black Army in the Nini River and Heini River areas. Because the Nini River has no boats to cross, and the water is shallow and muddy, it is very difficult to cross. Ma Zhanshan's Wu Songlin Brigade's cavalry of 3,000 men arrived at Kangjinjing on the 31st as reinforcements for the Nini River garrison. Shi Lanbin's 55th Artillery Regiment also rushed from Nehe to Hailun. The Black Army gathered in Hailun and Tongbei, about 18,000 strong. However, half of them lacked weapons and relied only on broadswords and red spears, forming martial arts groups, using their flesh and blood to fight the enemy. However, after May 18, the battles of Songpu City, Hulan County, Zhang Shiying Village, and Xiaohei Village all relied on these brave and strong men, who killed many enemies. The Japanese army suffered greatly from this, and later came to believe it was an evil art. They sought out village women, cut off their nipples, and blocked the muzzle of their cannons, believing it would ward off the evil. Many women on the Hu-Hai Railway were victimized as a result.</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan arrived in Hailun on May 31, convened a meeting of various generals, and decided to use Hailun as a military base and Tongbei County as a rear defense. He reorganized the various armies, with Ma himself as the commander-in-chief and Wu Songlin as his deputy. The commander of the 55th Artillery Regiment, Shi Lanbin, was the front-line commander. The temporarily organized commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade, Piao Datong, was the commander of the left-wing army, guarding Baiquan and Keshan to prevent the Japanese army in Heilongjiang from advancing south along the Zhai-Ke Railway. Li Haiqing was appointed commander of the left-wing army, advancing on Liangzhao to coordinate with the front line on the Hu-Hai Railway. That evening, Ma Zhanshan, with the plan completed, immediately returned to Tongbei and personally led more than 1,000 soldiers to deploy defenses between Hailun and Tongbei. Ma had learned that the Japanese army's Suzuki Mitsuto Brigade in Heilongjiang, in conjunction with the Amano unit, was advancing south from the Qike Railway to attack Ma's army from the rear, so he actively deployed defenses there to avoid shaking the rear defense. Currently, the Black Army's battle line has been slightly reduced due to the relationship with the force. The troops guarding the left bank of the Songhua River, Tonghe and Mulan, have all gathered in the Wangkui Qingcheng area. The Hei Jun Cai Hongyou brigade in Wangkui, about 1,500 strong, moved to Qingcheng on May 31, and will slant out of Hulan to cut off the Japanese army's retreat. This is also one reason why the Japanese army did not dare to attack Hailun hastily. Also, on the morning of May 30, at about 7 am, six Japanese planes flew from Harbin to Hailun and dropped more than 50 bombs, almost completely destroying the East and West Avenues. At that time, the fire was very fierce, and the south wind was very strong. The troops were busy fighting the fire and had no fire-fighting equipment, causing the fire to burn for a day and a night. It only went out on the morning of the 31st, and almost all the essence of the city was destroyed. At about 6 am on the 31st, several Japanese planes flew to Hailun again, but were bombed by the Black Army as they passed the Nini River. Two of the engines were damaged and fell to the north of Suihua. The Japanese sent a search team to rescue them, but they could no longer be used. One was forced to return to Harbin, and after arriving in Harbin, it fell into a civilian household in Ximajiagou, destroying the fuselage and seriously injuring the pilot. Therefore, the other Japanese planes turned back before reaching Hailun, and the city of Hailun was spared a second bombing. However, the Japanese army is determined to deal with Ma Zhanshan with all its strength. Because the military operations on the Nini River have not made progress, they have changed to attacking Zhaodong to suppress Li Haiqing's troops on the left wing of the Black Army. The Hiramatsu and Hitoo Regiments of the 14th Division were the main force, using the power of the air force. After a day of fierce fighting, Li's army initially found it difficult to resist and retreated to Zhaozhou. The Japanese army then advanced from Jiangdao. Li's troops were unable to support and retreated to Duiqingshan, and will transfer to Anda County for reorganization. The Japanese army also sent a separate detachment of 1,000 cavalry to attack Anda County again. The pseudo-governor of Heilongjiang Province, Cheng Zhiyuan, also requested the Japanese air force to bomb Anda. On the first day of this month, many Japanese planes had already gone. The details are still unknown. If Li's army is resolved by the Japanese army, Ma Zhanshan will lose its response, and the military situation is quite worrying.</p>
<p>When the League of Nations Investigation Team came to Harbin, the North Manchurian Volunteer Army had the greatest momentum. The various armies approached the suburbs of Harbin, with a potential to enter the city in one fell swoop. Since the Shanghai war has been concluded, the Japanese were able to transfer the 14th Division north, increasing their troop strength, and defeating them one by one. Ding Chao and Li Du were the first to be suppressed and retreated to Baoqing. Feng Zhanhai and Gong Changhai were also forced to retreat to Bin County.</p>
<p>Wang Delin and Liu Wankui retreated to Mudanjiang. The only one supported by Nikkashita (Japanese person) is Ma Zhanshan, fighting alone. (1st day)</p>

<h3 id="e94">A Batch of Communists Executed by Firing Squad <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party Smashed</p>
<p>Dozens of Male and Female Students Implicated</p>
<p>Changsha Communication: Since May 1, many communist leaflets and slogans have been discovered in Changsha, especially in various schools. Communist printed matter has been found in schools every day. Military and police detective personnel were mobilized to investigate day and night. On the evening of May 4, at 9 pm, Wang Wu, a pseudo-municipal committee member who distributed communist leaflets, was captured behind Miaogaofeng Middle School. Wang confessed that the organ of the Changsha Central Municipal Committee of the Communist Party was located at No. 4 Wangjia Lane outside the North Gate. The military and police immediately went to the address to search and seized many secret notices, diaries, and rosters. Subsequently, communists Zhang Qingping (organizer of the Maple Leaf Literary Society), Zhou Guancheng (technician of the Advanced Agricultural School), Dai Xiaoren (student of the Advanced Agricultural School), Zhang Ji (of the Changsha Central Municipal Committee), and male and female students from the First Middle School of the province and other schools, totaling seventy or eighty people, were arrested successively. However, because so many students were arrested, people throughout the province paid close attention. The party, government, and military authorities, after several consultations, decided to give all the implicated young men and women light sentences and assign them to their parents for supervision and rehabilitation. As for Wang Wu, Zhang Qingping, Zhang Ji, Dai Xiaoren, and Zhou Guancheng, who all betrayed the party after surrendering and were willing to be bandits, were all sentenced to death. They were tied up and taken outside Liuyang Gate at 3 pm on June 4 and executed by firing squad. He Jian also announced their crimes, stating: "The red bandit and important criminal Wang Wu (also known as Wang Wu, also named Foyan, also named Jinghui, alias Chen Qi), whose ancestral home is Anhua, and Zhang Qingping (also named Mengping, also named Zhang Quan) of Changsha, Zhou Moqiu of Liuyang, and others, were classmates at the Huangpu Military Academy. During the purge of the party, they were arrested and imprisoned at the same time due to their communist affiliation. They received years of rehabilitation. After they were released from prison one after another, Zhou Moqiu and his fellow villager Zhou Zhige came to Changsha last year to work secretly, living on the third floor of No. 4 Wangjia Lane outside the North Gate. Soon Wang also arrived and secretly set up the Red Bandit Pseudo-Changsha Central Municipal Committee in the building, distributed slogans and leaflets, and directed the party members in Yuanjiang, Yiyang, and Changsha to proceed, while colluding with Zhang Ji (also known as Zhang Jiren), a fellow party member he met in Huangpu prison, to expand proletarian literary propaganda. Zhang Ji introduced them to the resurrected Maple Leaf Literary Society to give lectures, and renamed the society Hongsheng (homophone of Red Army). Zhang Qingping and others used the name of literary research to advocate class struggle, causing ignorant young people to be anesthetized by them. Later, on the afternoon of May 4, at about 9 pm, Wang Wu and his bandit gang continued to distribute leaflets, hoping to create a red terror in the province. The investigators of the Changsha Public Security Bureau of Hunan Province caught him on the spot and found dozens of copies of the pseudo-municipal committee's Five-Four Proclamation to the Public in his pocket. The pseudo-central secret notice and Zhang Ji's secret diary were recovered in the pseudo-organ building. It was also discovered that Zhou Guancheng, a technician at the Provincial Advanced Agricultural School, who is currently a pseudo-municipal committee member Wang Wu, acted as guarantor, and that Dai Xiaoren, a student at the school, had confessed and then returned to work for the Red bandits. They were arrested at their addresses, and the people involved in the society (Maple Leaf Literary Society) were arrested and sent to the Ministry. After repeated inquiries by the headquarters, the criminals Wang Wu, Zhang Ji, Zhou Guancheng, Dai Xiaoren, Zhang Qingnianping, and others confessed that they organized the organ, advocated the redification, and betrayed after surrendering. Their crimes are serious and they should be sentenced to death according to the law, so that they may be warned to others. In addition to taking the criminals Wang Wu, Zhang Ji, Zhou Guancheng, Dai Xiaoren, and Zhang Qingping, etc., to the execution ground for a firing squad, and strictly arresting the fugitive bandits, and separately handling the related prisoners in custody, the charges are urgently announced to inform the public. This is the announcement." According to the report, Wang Wu and others used the "Maple Leaf Literary Weekly Society" as a tool in Changsha to lure students from various schools to join the society as members in the name of studying literature, and then anesthetized them, causing seventy or eighty male and female students in various schools to be implicated.

<p>A Tragic Case of Bandits Killing and Wounding Villagers: In the Chajia Bang area of the Five Ku District under the county, a large number of bandits were discovered last night. The director of the local public security substation, the police, and the security corps went forward to arrest them. The bandits resisted and dispersed. Two remaining bandits hid in a shed. At dawn today (7th), many villagers went to the fields to cut grass. The hidden bandits mistook the villagers for the arresting party. The two bandits went crazy and stabbed with knives. The villagers had nowhere to escape. Zhang Fuxiang, a 60-year-old villager, and his wife Zhang Chenshi, 50 years old, were stabbed to death on the spot. Zhang Longsan and his wife Zhang Xushi were stabbed and injured. Zhang Zhoushi was seriously injured. The bandits, seeing the tragedy they had caused, fled into the countryside. The injured have been sent by their families to Ruosifu Hospital in the city for treatment. However, Zhang Zhoushi's injuries were fatal and difficult to treat. Except for Zhang Longsan and his wife, who remained in the hospital for treatment, Zhang Zhoushi was taken back on the original boat. The severity of the banditry there is evident.</p>

<p>A Large Gang of Lake Bandits Robbing and Kidnapping: Recently, there has been a gradual decrease in the number of troops stationed in Kun County, so the bandit atmosphere is rampant again. At 3 pm on the 6th, more than 100 lake bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Wang Hanchen, a wealthy household in Pingzhuang Village in the Ninth District under the county. The entire group was armed. After entering the door, they robbed all the money, clothes, and belongings. Before leaving, they kidnapped Wang Ziyu, two of his daughters-in-law, and three workers into the boat and sailed away. After passing through the Duhejing area, they landed at Zhou Zhicheng's house and robbed them, injuring Zhou's wife with a gun butt. Zhou was tied up and taken to the boat, sailing towards Wangyang Cheng Lake in Zhuodun. When the bandits arrived at Zhuodun Mountain, they released the three Zhou workers and instructed them to send a letter to their master, preparing 100,000 to redeem them at a certain place. County Magistrate Cheng Ruji learned of this and urgently dispatched a team of police to rush to suppress them, but the bandits had already gone far away.</p>

After County Magistrate Cheng learned of this, he sent Police Chief Zhang Xianlin and Public Security Bureau Inspector Li Ruifu, leading dozens of armed police and patrolmen, to rush to suppress them by boat. When they arrived, the bandits had already fled upon hearing the news.</p>

The General Headquarters immediately dispatched Deputy Adjutant Guan, along with Patrolman Wang from the local Public Security Substation, to arrest Geng outside Xumen Gate. They also searched Geng's home at 27 Lianxi Lane for an hour but found nothing. Consequently, Geng was sent to the Public Security Bureau and then transferred to the General Headquarters for further investigation.

<p>Brutal Husband Kills Wife, Buries Body, and Attempts to Conceal Evidence: In Chen Douban Lane, Zhuang Chen Township, District 5 (Tianshang City) of the county, a villager named Chen Quangen was a carpenter. His family was poor. His wife, Lu (also known as A Qiao), was nearly forty years old and suffered from a mental illness, acting like a madwoman and speaking incoherently. They had two sons and one daughter: the eldest son named Jin Fu, the second son named Jin Sheng, and the daughter named A Mei. The eldest son currently works as a waiter in a restaurant near Huangbu Pier. Chen Quangen saw that his wife was demented and practically useless. Therefore, the relationship between husband and wife was very bad. On the evening of the 29th of last month, Chen Quangen suddenly had the idea to kill her. He killed Lu with a wooden object and moved the body to a mulberry field next to the Tangtou Education Hall. He dug a muddy pit and buried her naked, intending to conceal the evidence. The next day, villagers became suspicious because Chen Lu suddenly disappeared. They inquired with Chen Quangen, who sent his younger brother, Chen Panlao, hurrying to the city. He summoned his nephew, Jin Fu, to the countryside. They searched everywhere and even dredged the nearby river, but found no trace. It wasn't until the 5th of this month that Lu's body was found in the soil in the mulberry field next to the Education Hall. Thereupon, the son of the deceased, Chen Jinfu, together with You Pinshan, the head of the 21st Tu (a local administrative unit), reported to the County Court, requesting an examination. Upon receiving the report, the Prosecutor's Office had Prosecutor Shen conduct an interrogation. Because the testimony of the Tu head was confusing, he was ordered to post bail. Chen Jinfu was ordered to return home. The murderer, Chen Quangen, had escaped at the time, but was apprehended by his younger brother, Chen Panlao, at Zhoujing Corridor in Zhoujing Lane and sent to the police station of the 12th Public Security Sub-bureau for temporary custody. Yesterday (the 7th), Prosecutor Shen, along with Coroner Wang and court police, went to the scene of the crime to conduct a legal examination. The examination revealed that the deceased, Chen Lu, had slight discoloration over her entire body, and it was confirmed that she had been buried alive. After the examination, the family was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial. The murderer, Chen Quangen, was taken to the court for interrogation and custody, pending investigation.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Province's secondary school examinations will also be held later, and primary schools, which have always had examinations, will still conduct them this year.</p>
<p>Shanghai: According to a recent report, the city will hold graduation examinations for middle and primary schools on a scheduled basis. A reporter from the Education Society visited the person in charge of the Municipal Education Bureau to inquire about the examination methods. According to them, the bureau, after receiving the graduation examination regulations for middle and primary schools issued by the Ministry of Education, was considering them but had not yet decided whether to hold them. Later, because the city was located in a war zone, the schools were affected by the war, and the start of the school year varied. Various subjects could not be completed at the same time. Therefore, the graduation examinations for middle and primary schools this summer vacation will be temporarily suspended. A report has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for verification and instructions.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province: The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education received an order from the Ministry of Education, stipulating the graduation examination methods for middle and primary schools. It should have complied with the order and held the examinations this semester. However, the document from the Ministry arrived late, and the summer vacation was approaching. The public and private middle schools in the province were about to hold graduations, and there was insufficient time to prepare. Furthermore, the first time holding examinations should be handled with caution to ensure completion. A report has been submitted to the Ministry of Education requesting instructions on postponing the graduation examinations for middle school students this semester. As for primary school graduates, various counties and cities have always held examinations. The Department of Education has issued a notice to all counties and cities to follow the Ministry's order and organize examination committees to handle them separately. If they cannot be held this semester, they should state their reasons and submit them to the Department for verification.</p>

<p>In recent years, ball sports such as soccer and tennis in our country have made considerable progress, but handball has rarely been heard of. Even in Shanghai, few people pay attention to it.

<p>(7) Competition officials: all officials in the competition will be appointed by this department</p>

<p>The next morning, we met Mr. Zhu in the reception room of the Normal School. Please excuse me from recounting those polite words. We explained in detail the purpose of our trip to the city to invite him. Mr. Zhu listened, and a delighted expression appeared on his face. He said, "It's not easy for you teachers and me to find a school. You must all feel that sometimes it suits people's wishes, and sometimes it doesn't suit mine. Sometimes it doesn't suit my wishes, and sometimes it suits people's wishes. Last year on June 6th, I wrote a few short poems. As everyone knows, June 6th is called Teachers' Day. We teachers have to hold a meeting on this day to discuss how teachers can take on the important mission of cultivating children to create a new China and a new world. How should teachers act? My poems represent my views. Please take a look. If you all agree, I would be very willing to go to the countryside to help; if you don't agree, there's no need to force it. In short, I'm looking for a school that can implement my ideas, just like you all</p>
<p>are looking for a satisfactory teacher."</p>
<p>I said, "Mr. Zhu! That's just wonderful. I'll read them. Please explain anything I don't understand." Old Granny Song and Brother Chunsheng listened attentively:</p>
<p>"One</p>
<p>Last year, June 6th, The children cried in fright. This year, June 6th, The darlings are so happy.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Last year, June 6th, Buttocks stuck to the benches. This year, June 6th, Bodies drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Every year, June 6th, Dead books are no longer read. Only do living learning, The more you do, the less you have.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Every year, June 6th, The teacher grows the grain himself. When the stomach rumbles, Drink a bowl of green bean porridge.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Shanghai Education After the January 28th Incident (10) (2) Shang <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Nineteen Recent Schools</p>
<p>On March 1st, our army defended the second line of defense, and the war came to an end. The people of Shanghai temporarily stopped hearing gunfire and artillery. The frightened people gradually woke up. Parents wanted to send their children to school, teachers worked even harder in schools, and students felt that long-term absenteeism was not a good policy. Closed schools planned to reopen, and the number of students in schools that had already opened gradually increased. On March 16th, the Joint Association of Teachers and Staff of the China School issued a letter of encouragement to all schools to resume classes. Their reason was that since the enemy had accumulated decades of ambition to plot against us, the resistant actions against the enemy could not be stopped in a short time. We citizens must be calm, those who work should settle into their jobs, and those who study should settle into their studies, in order to cope with the long term. Education is the foundation of the country. Yue Wang Goujian used it to defeat Wu, and the Japanese used it to show their strength. We were brought to a poor and weak position due to the stagnation of education. Now the concession in the southern city is peaceful and quiet, and the melting spring scenery is the time for our youth to study hard. Please, patriotic teachers and students, temporarily endure the pain, calm your minds, invigorate your spirits, and quickly open school and start classes. Use twelve points of effort to seek practical scientific education to consolidate the national foundation for resisting foreign aggression. Such a proposition is indeed very important in times of chaos.</p>
<p>The ceasefire agreement was signed on May 5th, the anniversary of the revolutionary government, the day Sun Yat-sen took office as the extraordinary president. The air on all sides shows the image of clear skies after the rain and the earth returning to spring. Schools, of course, work hard to open their doors for the country and for the family. Even 90% of the private schools burned in the war zone have set up stoves, arranged desks and chairs, and started ringing the bells. Don't you see the brand new blue characters on a white background and white characters on a black background, almost every five steps and every ten steps, hanging high and majestically in the concession? The poor Pudong Middle School, Dongwu Second Middle School, and Danhua Middle School are still tightly closed for some reason. The classroom chairs are covered with dust, as if they have been exhausted by oppression and have no courage to struggle anymore.</p>
<p>The Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School, full of talented people, will restore its old appearance. Jingye Middle School, Xinlu Normal School, and Wusong Middle School are working together to make a fake</p>
<p>are merging with Chengdu Road and An Elementary School to hold classes, but there are less than 170 students, a decrease of two-thirds compared to the previous semester. A reporter heard the day before yesterday that Cheng Kuanzheng, the principal of Wusong Middle School, said that the three schools moved to Jingye Middle School in Xiaodongmen to hold classes. It is inconvenient for municipal elementary schools to act independently and recruit students in different places. Therefore, schools that have suffered from the war (as of April) still include Pengpu, Pusong, Yinxiang, Caojing, Zhenru, and Yinhang six districts' Jieyuan, Meicun, Chendu, Zhuku, Yucai, Zhalu, Zhuhang, Pengcheng, Zhenru, Guanlong, Zhangcun, Yizhong, Yinhang, Zhixing, Shen, Zhouwan and other twenty-four schools, all silent and without a single student. It is now heard that the Japanese troops have withdrawn, and they are all preparing to go back and open school.</p>
<p>The result of bombing, burning, destroying, and looting of municipal elementary schools in the three districts of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong is that many have been completely destroyed. Even if they have not been completely eliminated, many have collapsed or been damaged. Nine out of ten households have been abandoned, and school-age children can be said to be extinct. Even if schools are opened, no one will come to school. In the future, when peace is achieved, and we plan to revive, there should be a scientific, comprehensive plan that meets the needs of society. Therefore, at the end of February, the administrative organs carefully planned a proper solution. Starting in May, the schools in the three districts will be temporarily closed. Although the writing says "closed", in reality it is "start", starting the first step in preparing for the construction of schools in the near future. The reporter thinks that the construction of schools and even all cultural construction in the war zone will certainly be greater and more spectacular than before the war. The great Chinese nation will never bow its head, submit, fear, or fail to revive because of foreign invaders. It is only a matter of time before the blood and flesh of loyal soldiers will fertilize the land in the war zone, blooming with splendid cultural flowers. The Shanghai Education Bureau sees the clues in the regulations for the closure of schools in the three districts. The regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  All municipal elementary schools in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong three districts (hereinafter referred to as the three districts) shall be temporarily closed in accordance with these measures, pending the Bureau's consideration of the local situation and gradual planning of the entire recovery plan.</p>
<p>2.  The principals of the municipal elementary schools in the three districts shall complete the transfer clearly within one week from the date of the order, and the custodian appointed by the Education Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the custodian) shall temporarily receive and keep it.</p>
<p>3.  After the principals of the municipal elementary schools in the three districts have completed the transfer clearly, they shall be temporarily suspended from their duties and await separate transfer. All school workers in each school, except for those who are retained after consideration, shall be dismissed.</p>
<p>4.  The principals of the municipal elementary schools in the three districts shall follow the following regulations for the transfer procedures: A. The principals shall accompany the custodians to inspect the original school or the original school site and inform the custodian in detail whether the school buildings and bases are municipal property or rented property. B. The principals shall inform the custodians in detail of the names, ages, birthplaces, and guarantor's name, occupation, and address of the original school servants. C. The principals shall hand over the bases of the school buildings that were burned down, the remaining school buildings and school supplies, and the school property transferred to other places to the custodians for registration and reporting. D. If any school has a final account that has not been reported or the school district construction fund account is not clear, the principal shall be responsible for reporting or clearing it within a time limit. E. After the principals have completed the transfer clearly, they shall submit the transfer books signed and sealed by the custodians to the Education Bureau. F. These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval and promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Ambition and Strength of Japanese Athletes (Part 2) <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Translated by Jiang Huaiqing</p>
<p>Pole Vault and Low Hurdles: Nishida Shuhei in the pole vault has an excellent record of 4.15 meters, and there are several others who can reach a height of 4 meters. Minakuchi, a student at Meiji University, has a fastest time of 56 seconds in the 400-meter hurdles, truly a rare talent. Sumiyoshi Kosaku of Waseda University has a score of 3614.355 in the decathlon. In addition, there must be relay races included. The 400-meter record of 41.6 seconds was created by Inuma Kiyotoku, Sasaki, Ame Iwao, and Yoshioka Ryu.</p>
<p>400 Meters and High Jump: Other items worthy of pride include Nakajima Igai Taro of Waseda University in the 400 meters, his masterpiece being 49 seconds; Kimura Kazuo in the high jump, his best performance almost reaching a height of 3 meters; Oshima Kamakichi of Kansai University in the high jump and long jump; Kitamoto Masaji of Keio University in long-distance running; and Sanroku Yoshio, a graduate of Keio University, who holds the national high hurdle record. All are world-renowned.</p>
<p>All of the above athletes will attend the World Olympics this fall. Judging from their individual performances, they are confident that they will give a special performance, winning the highest score for Japan and shining the spirit of Great Japan sports to all countries in the world.</p>
<p>The Great Swimming Pool in Los Angeles: Japanese swimming ranked second in the 9th Dutch World Games. This time, the Japanese athletes are deeply accomplished, and there is a great possibility of winning international championships. The newly built Los Angeles swimming pool was built exquisitely and is rare in various countries because Mr. Nakagawa Kenzo, the Japanese consul in Los Angeles, had previously requested the opinion of the Japanese Olympic Committee. The famous aquatic heroes of various countries will compete in the magnificent swimming pool from August 6 to 13 to glory for their country.</p>
<p>Japan Defeated American Stars Last Year: Last August, Japan invited the American National Swimming All-Star Team to Japan. In a three-day confrontation with Japanese athletes at the Meiji Jingu Swimming Pool, the Japanese athletes defeated the American All-Star Team by a score of 40 to 23, which shocked the swimming circles of various countries at that time.</p>
<p>Makino's Amazing Masterpiece: The extraordinary masterpiece of Japanese athletes is the highest record of 10 minutes, 25 seconds, and 2 tenths of a second in the 800-meter freestyle for middle and long distances by Japanese athletes. However, in last year's Japan-US confrontation, Makino Masazo set a shocking world record of 10 minutes and 6.6 seconds. The American generals Krabbe, Little, and Wiegerte were all defeated by the 15-year-old young hero Makino, truly the first miracle man in the world.</p>
<p>Creating a Special Situation: In addition, the Japanese championship holder Yamamoto Haruo's 200-meter freestyle in 2 minutes, 15 seconds, and 4 tenths of a second, Minakuchi's 100-meter freestyle in 59.2 seconds, and the 800-meter relay swim in 9 minutes, 20 seconds, and 9 tenths of a second created by Meiji University athletes, and the 300-meter medley relay in 3 minutes and 31 seconds are all outstanding achievements. In the previous World Games, Japan lost to Sweden, Austria, and Germany, which were famous in the swimming world, by 18 to 45 points, second only to the championship America. With the great progress of Japanese athletes, they will definitely be able to create a special situation. At the moment, the Japan Aquatic Sports Association is still selecting diving and water polo teams, as well as female athletes, to participate in the World Games, which is currently underway.</p>
<p>Rowing: In addition to the two important items of track and field swimming, it is also planned to send two groups of rowing athletes, one group of four and one group of eight, who are currently training. In last year's rowing competition between Waseda and Keio Universities, Waseda won the eight-person championship, and Keio won the four-person championship. Now, the athletes from these two universities are about to represent Japan at the World Games, which will also add a lot of glory to Japan.</p>
<p>The Tenth World Games is at hand. The high-spirited and energetic Japanese athletes will cross the Pacific Ocean on a long expedition, carry forward, work hard, and strive to win the championship in the Tenth Olympic Games in the world. This is what everyone wishes and congratulates. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Terrible Fall of the Lil Silver Market <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>New Low Price: 6 Mace, 9 Fen, 4 Li</p>
<p>Market Overview: This year, due to the current situation, unexpected news that could never be imagined has often occurred. This drop in foreign lil silver is truly unprecedented. It was expected that upon expiration, there would be a gradual recovery for use, but it went against this expectation. Not only was it unable to recover, but it continued to decline rapidly. If this continues without restraint, the financial world will face the hidden worry of having nothing to do, and various businesses will face the difficulty of cash flow. This is truly a great misfortune for merchants. Today is the Summer Solstice, and the silver and money businesses are closed.</p>
<p>Lil Silver Discount Price: The "Foreign Lil Silver" market sentiment changed in the morning, and the situation became very weak, and sellers became more active. As a result, it was one and a half li smaller than the lowest price of the previous morning, at 6 mace, 9 fen, 4 li, 8 hao, 7 hu, and a half. The afternoon market was even more dangerous, falling another 875, to 6 mace, 9 fen, 4 li, an unprecedented new low price. Due to the long-term loosening of silver credit, the "Silver Discount" market had abundant reserves, so the morning and afternoon silver discounts were always borrowed without interest, and there was no increase in the commission rate.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The morning and afternoon prices of Jiangnan small silver coins were both 5 mace, 9 fen, and 9 li, which was 1 and a half li smaller than the previous day. However, it also entered the 6 mace mark, mostly due to the fall in foreign lil silver. The transaction volume was 4,000 jiao in the morning market and unheard of in the afternoon market. Although Guangdong small silver coins did not have a huge drop yesterday, they were also reduced by about 1 li due to the foreign lil silver relationship. The morning market was 5 mace, 9 fen, 3 li, and 2 hao and a half, and the afternoon market was 5 mace, 9 fen, and 3 li and a hao and a half. The transaction volume was 235,000 jiao in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Steel dollars also deviated from the norm, and the price yesterday was 2,000 wen longer than the previous day, a new price of 425,500 wen, which is also an unprecedented event in the history of steel dollars.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" Yesterday, due to unstable market sentiment and the unfinished period after settlement, there were not many collections. Chinese merchants collected 2.3 to 2.4 million in ticket funds, foreign merchants collected 1.7 to 1.8 million in ticket funds, remittance collections were more than 1.1 million, cargo funds were more than 1.8 to 1.9 million, mortgage funds were more than 1.2 million, telegraphic transfers were more than 500,000, customs duties were also more than 500,000, miscellaneous collections were more than 2.8 to 2.9 million, foreign funds were more than 600,000, warehouse outflow was 900,000, money shop and silver guild single collections were more than 19 million, commission rate collections were more than 3.3 million, various remittance collections were more than 400,000, and cash collections were 400,000 to 500,000. "Foreign Funds" The morning market for remittance and ticket funds was 615,000, and the afternoon market was 475,000. Banknotes were 50,000 in the morning market and 20,000 in the afternoon market. Off-exchange banknotes were 160,000 in the morning market and 50,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading in the morning market was 550,000 in mutual trading, and 400,000 in mutual trading in the afternoon market. The inflow and outflow of foreign accounts of various banks was more than 1.1 million, the inflow and outflow of banknotes was more than 1.1 million, the single collections of foreign guilds in money shops were more than 4.8 million, the foreign commission rate collections were more than 2.1 million, the inflow and outflow of foreign funds for borrowing was more than 1.2 million, and the transactions of small money shops in the inflow and outflow of banknotes and remittance commission were 400,000 to 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Margin Money in a Peaceful Process <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Continued Good for Two Mace and Six Fen: Yesterday's margin money market was peaceful, but not too tortuous. The total daily difference was six taels, and in the end, it continued to rise by two taels and several fen. More numbers bought than sold. It initially trended upward because the silver price was reported to have fallen, and the silver market futures had also fallen back. Later, short sellers pushed in, and the exchange rate was slightly better, so it exceeded 720 taels. After that, there were ups and downs of more than two taels. The aftermarket was extremely peaceful. All buying and selling belonged to the retail trade. Both long and short sides were waiting because today (Summer Solstice) is a market holiday. Finally, it stood between 21 taels. Now the detailed situation of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>Long Positions Opened High: It rose by one tael and five fen from the opening of the July market, to 719 taels and five fen. The price of large bars did not change, the silver price shrank by one-eighth, and the private telegraph also dropped by three-sixteenths. However, Yuhe, Tianfeng, Yongfu, Yu, Tongtaichang, and others sold, and it immediately fell by more than one tael to 18 taels and two fen. Then, Yuanmao, Yongda, Xingyongheng, Yu, Zhifengyong, Yuhe, and others came to compete to buy, and the US dollar for September could be sold for 31.625, while only 1875 was settled in August. The industry made some grabs, which caused the gold price to rise suddenly by six taels, to 24 taels and two fen at more than 9:10. Then, HSBC released British gold for June at 0625, and Hongkang Yong, Zhifengyong, Dalian Gang, and others sold. Silver companies sold US dollars for September at 31 and a half, so it was less than two taels. At 9:30, the British gold disclosure was not changed, and the internal was stable. US dollars for August were paired at 1895, and half dollars for September were also made. The British and American exchange rates were calculated at 37575. At 9:45, 24 taels and two fen were continued. However, the seller’s upper market did not continue to seek it. Bingxing, Hengshunli, and others sold, and because the US dollar for the month could be settled at 25, and the British gold was calculated at 1875, the gold price was reduced by four taels. At 10:30, the head of the item and Hengxing and others bought in, returning two taels. Until 11:30, it was 22 taels and three fen, but in this small hour, it was only a few fen up and down. Bingxing Tianfeng Yong and retail longs sold, so it fell back by more than one tael. The noon collection was 22 taels and eight fen, and the revealed price was calculated to be within 70 taels.</p>
<p>The Aftermarket Was Miserable and Unbearable: The aftermarket opened at 22 taels and five fen. Dalian Gang's receipts and payments were inconsistent, but Dadecheng and item heads were all in, so the price increased by one tael, to 21 taels and six fen. Then, US dollars for October were bought by the wheat firm for 75, and British gold for October was paired at 25, and retail sales fell downstream, to 22 taels and three fen. After 2:30, one tael was slightly added, but there were very few transactions. Around 3:00, it was 21 taels and four fen. Later, Hongkang Yongshunli and others sold, so it dropped by more than one tael. At nearly 4:00, it was 20 taels. British gold for September was difficult to sell at 1875. Later, there were several fen to settle the deal. At 4:15, it was 21 taels. Later, it was 22 taels and four fen. The transactions were mostly retail deals. The market closed at 4:30 at 22 taels and six fen, which was two taels and six fen more than the previous day. Guang Bang Yifeng bought in and raised it to 21 taels. According to the daily maximum price of 24 taels and two fen and the minimum price of 18 taels and two fen, there was a difference of six taels. The revealed price was calculated to be 70 taels. The registered water replenishment was calculated to be 21 taels, and the bare bar was calculated to add 9 taels and five fen.</p>
<p>No Large Inflow and Outflow: According to the face transaction statistics, Yuan Maoyong, Yuanda Yong, Hengxing, Wanxing, Yifeng Yong, Yuantai, Futai Heng, and Yuhe all entered. Hengyu and Daxingyong also entered. Shunli, Tongtaichang, Hongmayong, and Bingxing all exited. Zhifengyong, Richang, Fuyu, and Dadecheng had very troublesome inflows and outflows. Remittance sleeves had both inflows and outflows. In the afternoon, Dadecheng, Yifeng, and Yuhe all entered. Hongkangyong and Shunli all exited. Other numbers were quite rare. Both Dalian Gang and Guang Bang did not have much buying and selling.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Foreign Exchange: British Loose, American Tight <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday, the silver market saw British silver flat and American silver fall, and the exchange rate returned slightly. However, HSBC's listing only reduced the French exchange rate by one yuan and the German exchange rate by half a mark. The rest remained unchanged. The internal market was British loose and American tight, which was related to the rebound in the exchange rate, but the situation was quite stable. It seemed tight in the early morning, but the gold price fell, and then it tended to stabilize. The afternoon was flat. As a result, compared with the previous night, the British gold rose slightly by 0625, and the American gold shrank by 125 to 0625. There were no foreign news.

<h3 id="e124">Large Bars Rose by 0625 <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>

<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e125">Bond Prices Slightly Rebounded <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Trend Is Peaceful and the Market Is Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market situation of various bond futures at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was not lonely. The total daily opening was 85,000 yuan, including 20,000 for finance, 18,000 for salt tax, 15,000 each for reorganization and 20 customs duties, and 5,000 to 6,000 for other items. The futures market was slightly clearer than the previous day. The market was very calm in the morning market with two rounds, and only 1.5 million yuan was opened. The afternoon market was slightly better, with a turnover of about 2.5 million yuan. The statistics were 3.995 million yuan. Various bonds such as unified salt tax, 20 customs duties, and troop reduction were all good, while the entire 6 customs duties and 96 bonds were extremely rare. As for the changes in bond prices in the morning and afternoon, the environment was quiet. Because today is the Dragon Boat Festival, various industries are closed, so the market is deserted. All parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the supply and demand situation is quite balanced. The bond futures rose from the previous day because there were few sales on the market, but the number was only about half a yuan. Only the spot of the entire 6 financial bonds fell by one yuan and several jiao, and the spot of the 19th good bonds in July was also slightly weak. Looking at the future of the bond market, if there are no major developments in the environment, it will be difficult to have major changes for a while because it is within the accounting period of June.</p>

<p>(Report from the American Eastern Bank Company)</p>
<p>New York on Monday presented a technical reaction, so the two-day rise has been slightly suppressed, and prices have also fallen back with public debt securities, but in the aftermarket, they have all tended to be firm. Industrial stocks fell by 1.56 pounds, which is slightly more serious, but Monday's reaction is purely technical. The only consumption that deserves attention on this day is the Senate's difficulty in resolving the issue of whether to include electricity tax in the tax bill, but according to the latest news, the entire tax bill has been passed by the Senate. Another phenomenon in the market on Monday is enough to prove that the reaction belongs to technical covering. Sellers in the aftermarket have almost disappeared, so the market is actively upward, and several stocks have even exceeded the height reached on the previous day, especially public utility stocks. Regarding the budget issue, the Senate passed the tax bill on the 6th. After the passage of this bill, the national tax revenue is expected to reach 111.9 million yuan, while the total expenditure is 112.5 million yuan. The shortage of 6 million yuan will be reduced from government expenses. The budget balance issue has been resolved, and the industrial and commercial circles will follow the banking circles to make constructive efforts. According to the news on the 6th, the White House has announced that it will increase the financial relief agency's capital to 300 million yuan, establish a domestic loan discount bank, and establish a financial and industrial mixed committee in accordance with the Federal Reserve system. With these kinds of plans, it is predictable that the recent rebound in the stock market will continue to progress. The Dow Jones Index on Monday is as follows:</p>
<p>June 4 | June 6 | Up and Down</p>
<p>---|---|---|</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks | 50.88 | 49.32 | Down 1.56</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks | 17.64 | 17.07 | Down 0.57</p>
<p>20 Public Utility Stocks | 19.83 | 19.31 | Down 0.52</p>
<p>Attached is the Shanghai Commercial Securities Index of the American Eastern Bank Company:</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Decline in the Yarn Market Is Gradually Being Discovered <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is very weak, and the downward trend is gradually rising. Due to the very low prices of overseas flower yarns, the bottom price of the local yarn is too high, so the market atmosphere is quite unstable. Fortunately, the bottom goods of various factories are not very strong, and they can still be maintained for a while. However, measuring the world situation, the 50 tael mark is difficult to preserve, and the future is difficult to be optimistic. Now the actual demand is becoming more and more light. There is absolutely no vitality in North China, and the Yangtze River is also in the scope of Japanese merchants' influence. The only place that can be relied on is Nanbu, where the sales volume is thin. In the later period, it will gradually enter a light season, so the people are unanimously pessimistic. It is found that a certain country's yarn has fallen by another 3 yuan outside.</p>
<p>The Margin Continuously Fell by Eight or Nine Qian: The Margin Market opened in the morning market, with American cotton falling back, and the people's sentiment loosened. Each month fell by four, five, six, and eight qian. The situation was still weak in the afternoon, and each month fell by another three or five qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 17,550 packages. It was found that Delong sold 550 packages, Tongfu sold 350 packages, Shenji sold 600 packages, Renfeng sold 600 packages, Xincheng sold 400 packages, and Yichang sold 450 packages. Jifeng bought 400 packages, Gengfeng bought 1,350 packages, Shunda bought 1,350 packages, Heshen bought 450 packages, and Yichang bought 500 packages. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Margin Closing: Up and Down | Account Balance | October 1509 | Down 9 | 34,250</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>July 1511 | Down 8 | 17,850 | November 1511 | Down 7 | 25,950</p>
<p>August 1509 | No Change | 26,000 | Total |  | 133,600</p>
<p>September 1509 | No Change | 28,950 |  |  |</p>
<p>The Consumption of Spot Yarn Is Mediocre: The digestion of spot yarn is mediocre. It was found that each gang bought a total of 800 packages, and the fellow merchants entered 30 packages. The market fell by five to seven and a half qian. The guest gangs entered 15 packages from Jiangxi, 35 packages from Ningbo, 20 packages from Shantou, 30 packages from Xiamen, 50 packages from Guangdong, 45 packages from the interior, 20 packages from Fujian, 36 packages from the northern gang, 480 packages from Yunnan, 10 packages from Xuzhou, and 100 packages from Changsha.</p>
<p>The Cotton Market Is Becoming More and More Unsupportable</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Near Term Is Approaching the 30 Tael Mark <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, and the downward trend is still strong. Because American cotton has fallen back by more than 10 pounds, the people are becoming more and more empty. Some buyers are also showing panic, and they have to endure the pain of cutting losses. The market is becoming more and more downstream. In short, the actual demand is stagnant, and various factories have no intention of moving. Moreover, the situation of foreign cotton is not good, so most people tend to sell, and the market price is even more difficult to maintain. It was found that the lowest price of standard cotton last year was 30 taels and 6 qian, and today's July price has reached 30 taels and 2 qian, discovering a new low price that has not been seen in several years.</p>
<p>Zheng Margin Fell Again by Three or Four Qian: Zheng Margin opened in the morning market, with American cotton falling back, and the market was even more weak. Each fell by two qian. In the afternoon, there were long settlements, and the downward trend was even stronger. Each month fell by another two qian and five fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 33,500 dan. It was found that Yichang sold 1,600 dan, Changhe sold 3,000 dan, and Shenchang sold 1,600 dan. Yuanda bought 4,200 dan, Gengfeng bought 3,900 dan, and Tongfu bought 700 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Margin Closing: Up and Down | Account Balance | October 3090 | Down 45 | 87,900</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>July 3040 | Down 40 | 47,600 | November 3120 | Down 35 | 68,400</p>
<p>August 3070 | Down 40 | 78,300 | Total |  | 282,200</p>
<p>The Consumption of Raw Cotton Is Extremely Light: The consumption of spot cotton is very light. Various factories have no appetite, and the price of American cotton is especially weak. The actual demand is even more lacking. The source is estimated to be 455 packages of Yao flower.</p>
<p>Yao Flower | 27.70 | Hongzhang Entered | 600 Packages | Sent to Factory</p>
<p>Yao Flower | 28.50 | Yongyu Entered | 500 Packages | Sent to Factory</p>
<h3 id="e129">American Cotton Fell Again <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton lacked important buyers, the weather was good, and there were long settlements. The market was weak. The futures fell by 18 to 20 pounds, and the spot fell by 15 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 1 point, and the spot rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 10 points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but later softened due to the sale by some Japanese merchants. Pingguoer rose by 6.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 5.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (6th telegram):</p>
<p>Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | Equivalent to Shen Standard | Indian Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | Equivalent to Shen Standard</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>July | 512 Down 18 | 22.20 | July | 385 Flat | 25.70</p>

<p>Last week, American cotton was weak.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Europe and India Settle Accounts <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>New York, June 3rd dispatch: The cotton market situation for the week is as follows: This week, the raw cotton market has been weak due to a large number of settlements from Europe and India. Furthermore, the stock and commodity markets were also weak, making the cotton market even more sluggish. Although the July futures price fell below five cents, the market rebounded, rising by more than one dollar per bale. However, confidence is still lacking, and settlement activities are prevalent. News of extremely unsatisfactory domestic and foreign trade, as well as anxieties about political developments, have contributed to the weakness of the cotton market. The reports on climate and cotton crop conditions this week have been satisfactory. Many believe that the drop in cotton prices has consolidated the actual position. However, although demand from the trade has picked up at low prices, general buyers have expressed hesitation, anticipating that if the weather is favorable in June, local settlements may increase in July. At the same time, sentiment is uncertain, and everyone is closely watching developments on Wall Street and in Washington.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3 id="e131">Tunxi Zhenmei Plummets Again <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since the opening of the market, Tunxi Zhenmei green tea has been exceptionally sluggish. Last week, it had already dropped by thirty to forty taels. However, the market situation has remained depressed in recent days. Chinese tea merchants, aware of this situation, have had to repeatedly lower prices to seek sales. Yesterday, Jinlong Foreign Firm bought several hundred boxes, and the market price fell another four or five taels. However, the Zhenmei (Needle Sprout) variety is sold as soon as it arrives, and the market is still quite firm. Various firms, including Yingzhuang Xiehe, Tianyu, Jinlong, and Tongfu, are purchasing Qimen black tea, and there have been no significant changes in prices.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Wuxi Cocoon Merchants Freely Handling Drying for Farmers <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Business Tax Exemption Granted</p>
<p>More Farmers Drying Cocoons Themselves Due to Low Cocoon Prices</p>
<p>Farmers in various cities and villages in Wuxi have suffered damage to their early and late silkworm crops this year due to weather conditions. Although new cocoons have been successively launched on the market, the overall cocoon production is only twenty to thirty percent of normal years. Only fifteen cocoon merchants have opened for business. Most silk mills in the urban area have scales set up to collect cocoons in front of their doors. Arrivals are gradually increasing, and most are limiting prices for cocoon purchases. The highest price for high-quality foreign varieties of cocoons is only around thirty yuan. More silkworm farmers are drying the cocoons themselves, and the cocoon merchants who have not opened for business are allowed to freely dry cocoons for farmers, with a one-year exemption from business tax.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Foreign Firm Silk Market Collapses <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the local foreign firm silk market has completely collapsed. Upon investigation, silk prices in the European and American markets have repeatedly plummeted, and telegrams regarding Chinese silk have been scarce. European firms are taking a wait-and-see approach. Although there were short-covering transactions in yellow and white silk yesterday, silk prices continued to weaken. It is estimated that ten bales of Zhonghe Jima brand top-grade Qilibai dried silk were priced at only five hundred taels. Five bales of Samsung Jinzhou top-grade yellow silk were priced at four hundred and twenty taels. Ten bales of Kechang Guopen second-grade yellow silk were priced at three hundred and thirty-one taels.</p>
<p>Grain</p>
<h3 id="e134">Hexia Rice Market Loosens <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the rice market's domestic sources totaled only thirty-odd vessels. However, there were few stocks in the warehouse. Demand from urban and rural stores waned due to the warmer weather and the continued weakness of foreign rice. Sentiment was mediocre, so demand was present but not strong. Transactions were similar to the previous day. There was also no change in the prices of thick japonica rice. Arrivals of thin indica rice were scarce, and sales were sluggish. Market prices were slightly firm. Foreign refined rice was scarce and in demand, with no significant price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, there were thirty to forty vessels of sources. Transactions on this street were sparse because both merchants were approaching the settlement period. Today and tomorrow, both the northern and southern markets will be closed. Changzhou, Wuxi, and Kunshan, Jiangyin, Yixing, and other white japonica rice varieties fell by one dime, and other goods also showed a downward trend. The Hechang rice mills in both markets opened with about two thousand piculs.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Foreign Rice Continues to Fall by One Dime <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Merchants Trial Small-Batch Coarse Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was very quiet. There were no transactions of even one bag during the first half of the day. In the afternoon, local village merchants came to the market to make some purchases, but there were few transactions. Prices continued to fall by a dime. This was mainly because there was sufficient rice in Shanghai, arrivals were also strong, and demand was sluggish. National buyers were taking a wait-and-see approach. Sentiment was weak, and financial problems hindered transactions. Only when the city's stock of 1.3 million piculs of rice had been mostly sold off would there be vitality. The total quantity sold by merchants on this street was only about a thousand bags. Zhenjiang merchants then trialed 1,500 bags of small-batch coarse rice. The market stabilized slightly. The price of small-batch coarse rice opened at $9.32, small-batch $200 at $10.65, red large-batch $300 at $9.67, Saigon No. 1 $400 at $11.85, and Mindang rice $100 at $10.09. Additionally, merchants on this street purchased Jiangxi Ji Yuan $100 at $14.35.</p>
<h3 id="e136">New Flour Lowest at 1.9 Taels <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market remained depressed after the opening bell in the morning for all months, because foreign wheat quotations fell again by about thirty to forty cents and sixty to seventy cents. The global recession has not changed. Domestic flour sales are very quiet, especially in the three northeastern provinces, where sales are even worse than before. Flour mills have stockpiles and no way out. There is good reason for the lack of enthusiasm. However, there was a slight improvement later due to short-covering. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market sentiment was weak again. The lowest price for July was 1 tael 9 qian, August to 9 qian 05 li. Later, because there was a slight intake from outside the trade, the factories did not move and temporarily moved to a stable state. However, the future silence and stagnation still look flat and weak. As a result, July, August, and September each fell by 1 fen 2.5 li compared with the previous day, October fell by 1 fen 5 li, and November fell by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Marked Wheat All Plummeted Violently <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for wheat futures showed a consistent and violent decline for all months after the opening bells in the morning and afternoon. Because the trend of foreign wheat is not good, the domestic environment is very different from the past. The flour mills now have ample stocks, and they cannot avoid giving up on new wheat. Moreover, domestic finance is not smooth, and the purchasing power of both inside and outside the industry is extremely negative. In this environment, the market has no vitality to speak of. The opening price for July was still 4 qian 1 fen, but the closing price in the afternoon fell to 3 qian 6 fen. The drop has reached a huge 2 qian 1 fen after just two days of trading. The distant months are also roughly the same. Looking ahead, if there is no solution to the financial situation, it will be difficult to maintain the current price. As a result, July fell 1 qian 3 fen compared with the closing price of the previous day, August and September fell 1 qian, October fell 9 fen, and November fell 8 fen.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3 id="e138">White Tung Oil Rises on Hankou Telegram <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Recently, white tung oil prices in Hankou have turned upward because the supply is gradually decreasing. The lowest wholesale price for domestic sales was only 13 taels 68 qian, but it quickly increased to 14 taels 4 qian, and the market is already showing tension. Yesterday, however, a telegram was suddenly received from Hankou stating that the wholesale price had increased to 15 taels 2 qian, based on foreign exchange rates, and the trend is still expected to rise. Although the reason for the rise was not detailed in the telegram, it is speculated that it was because the price had fallen too much this spring, and speculators had all withdrawn from this business, resulting in a sudden drop in supply. The rising trend is just beginning.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3 id="e139">Summer Goods Gradually Show Vitality <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market has been stable in recent days. Customer sales are still constrained by financial issues, making it difficult to develop as much as possible. In addition, silk prices in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas have fallen sharply. Later, there will be a slack season, and it will be difficult to see any improvement. However, the retail sales on this street are the highest in recent years, and small-scale businesses can be seen everywhere. This is because the current price of goods is lower than ever before. Since the weather has turned hot, summer goods have gradually shown vitality. White leno and muslin, which were stagnant and motionless, have now been sold out. Yesterday, Meizuishi goods were sold out at 2 qian 7 fen. The good Huamaolong goods on the market have also fallen in price. Zhonghe goods require 2 qian 8 fen 5 li. Poplin for trousers is selling even better, with a price increase of about 2 fen compared to last month. Marked cloth is still listless. Fine twill and fine cloth fall as soon as they arrive. Various factories are launching large quantities of coarse cloth. Transactions of Samsung, Kuixing, and Hongfu brands totaled more than a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e140">Coarse Sand White Rises Gradually <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Factory's Crystal Sugar Market Also Calls for Higher Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for the Sugar Association's public trading was still active, and sentiment remained good. The supply of 24-grade coarse white sugar from the Netherlands was scarce, and the transaction price of Hong Kong goods rose to 13 taels 7 qian 5 fen. Several hundred bags were sold from the Jian bang, with high-grade goods priced at 13 taels 9 qian 5 fen. Demand was quite strong, and the market was very prosperous. The trend of 18-grade medium white sugar at 13 taels 2 qian and 9-grade Dutch red sugar at 9 taels 9 qian was also firm. Taikoo sugar B, Tianjin goods at 16 taels 2 qian, CW mark at 15 taels 7 qian 5 fen to 8 qian, and H mark at 12 taels 4 qian all had solid markets. Due to the rising price of coarse white sugar, the factory's crystal sugar market also called for higher prices. However, sales have not been very smooth, resulting in fewer transactions.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Held an Extraordinary Meeting Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e141">Discussing Three Important Cases <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Issue of Road Construction Beyond the Boundaries is Submitted to the Central Government for Review</p>
<p>The Construction of the City Center District is Decided to Continue in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Instructing the Finance Bureau to Raise 5 Million to Revitalize the War Zone</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Municipal Government of this city held an extraordinary municipal meeting. Attendees included Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, the directors of various bureaus, and Councilor Yin Rugeng. The important items discussed included: (1) the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries; (2) the issue of the city center district; and (3) the issue of revitalizing the municipal administration in the war zone. Regarding the first item, the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries, because both parties had already signed and approved the outline of the draft agreement on the issue, in addition to Secretary-General Yu's report on the progress, the content of the articles was also studied and discussed in detail. As a result, an opinion letter was attached to the outline of the draft agreement and submitted to the Central Government for review. The second item, the construction of the city center district, was decided to continue the work. The third item, the issue of revitalizing the municipal administration, was decided to be carried out by the Municipal Finance Bureau raising 5 million to carry out. The discussion ended at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Negotiations for Road Construction Beyond the Boundaries</p>
<h3 id="e142">Attitudes of Various Related Countries <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Except for Japan, Which Expressed Clear Opposition</p>
<p>The Others All Believe That the Resolution is Not a Problem</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Concession Board have recently negotiated the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries of the Shanghai Public Concession. According to the official announcement of the authorities, a considerable stage has been reached, and it can be resolved after the two parties separately request instructions from the National Government and the Shanghai Consular Body. After receiving this report, the government will have a thorough consideration, and the Consular Body will also have considerable research. Therefore, the attitudes of the countries related to the Public Concession are of general concern. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specifically inquired about everything from various related parties. The information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>British Side: British Administrative Consul Davidson is responsible for this matter. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited him twice, but was unable to meet him because he was attending the Hartung estate as a witness. Subsequently, because the British side regarded Marsel, the chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, as more reputable, and he had also written to the Consular Body regarding the Roundtable Conference, requesting that it be convened as soon as possible, he was directly met at the Xiangxing Company. According to his conversation, the British side has no objection to resolving the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries. He believes that this matter is not a matter for the Consular Body and the Chinese government. To seek a resolution, Mayor Wu Tiecheng and the authorities of the Public Concession Board can handle it directly. In the future, if the Concession Board must wait for the collective deliberation of the Shanghai Consular Body, he is not prepared to make any suggestions. As for the report in the Continental Daily that he wrote to the Consular Body requesting that the Roundtable Conference be convened as soon as possible, he believes that this is also a fair suggestion, because the Roundtable Conference is not held solely for the events of China and Japan. Its scope includes the nature of discussing international events, that is, the Chinese National Government also announced that the Manchurian incident must be discussed. As for the so-called Shanghai by the city, etc., this statement is too strange, and he strongly disagrees. Finally, he stated that he has been in Shanghai for 27 years and is very familiar with everything in Shanghai. In addition, he discussed many other situations.</p>
<p>Other Countries: Other countries, except for Japan, which has already expressed extremely clear opposition, generally have no significant opinions. (1) According to the American Administrative Consul Mu Qiu, he has not yet obtained the detailed content regarding the upcoming resolution of road construction beyond the boundaries. It will probably be decided first by China and the Concession Board themselves. He has not heard of the Consular Body convening a meeting. It is difficult to say what attitude the American community in Shanghai will take on this matter. In short, this road is more important in the relationship between China and Japan, and the US seems to have no objection. (Note: The above refers specifically to North Sichuan Road.) (2) According to the Counselor of the Italian Legation, Ross, he does not yet know what attitude the Italian side will take. This matter has not yet been discussed. He believes that this kind of small matter does not require discussion or the expression of an attitude. (3) The Danish Consul General, Luo En, believes that this matter is not a big problem and should proceed in the same way as other countries. If a meeting of the Consular Body is convened to consider this matter, it will not be so early. It will probably be decided by Nanjing, etc.</p>
<p>Secret Deliberations of the Consular Body: Guowen News Agency reports that regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries, since the Municipal Government and the Concession Board contacted each other, both parties have discussed specific measures and submitted them to their superiors for instructions. According to reliable sources yesterday, the draft agreement agreed upon by the two parties consists of a total of sixteen articles. The Consular Body is currently secretly discussing it these days, and it takes a lot of time to discuss the articles. It is heard that a public discussion will be convened by the consuls of various countries within this week in order to resolve the issue as soon as possible. As for our country, the original text of the draft is now being submitted for review, and it is also heard that it can be issued and announced within this week.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Negotiations for the Japanese Army to Withdraw Quickly <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun Denies Restoring Administration First</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Japanese army's withdrawal, since Okazaki, the Japanese committee member of the Joint Committee, notified our committee member Yu Hongjun by telephone the day before yesterday, informing him that he still needs to continue consulting with the Japanese naval authorities and asking for a little more time, Yu has not received any further indications from the Japanese side until last night. However, yesterday, all newspapers reported that before the Japanese side has a clear indication of the areas where the Japanese army has not withdrawn, we have decided to restore police power and administrative power in the two places first. This is a misunderstanding of rumors. Regarding the restoration of administrative power, a reporter from the Far East News Agency asked Committee Member Yu Hongjun the day before yesterday, and according to Committee Member Yu, the Japanese army's long delay in withdrawing has no basis at all. It is clear that they cannot violate the treaty of truce and station their troops in areas where they should not be stationed. Therefore, we can only urge them to withdraw in order to restore our administrative power as soon as possible, otherwise the Japanese army will be responsible for destroying the truce agreement. Yesterday, the reporter saw that the news in the newspaper was the opposite of Mr. Yu's statement, so he visited and asked Mr. Yu again about this news, and he strongly denied it. He said that when he met with Okazaki on the fourth, he criticized that the Japanese army would not withdraw for a day, and he could not exercise his power for a day. At that time, Okazaki said that we might as well restore the power first. But how can the exercise of power be under the authority of another country's army? Therefore, he immediately expressed his opposition at that time and strongly urged them to withdraw. In short, before the Japanese army completely withdraws, he will never send a policeman or an official to post in the administrative district. The reports in the newspapers may have some misunderstanding on this point.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Telephone Workers Strike <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly Implemented at 7 PM Last Night</p>
<p>Eleven Demands Raised</p>
<p>Telephone Calls Not Affected</p>
<p>Yesterday, starting at 7:00 PM, the workers of the Shanghai Telephone Company suddenly declared a strike. After 7:00 PM last night, telephone service was disrupted in the French Concession and a part of the western district of the Public Concession. After repairs, it was fully restored at 9:00 PM. Telephone calls throughout the city were normal. According to workers' claims, about 3,000 telephone company workers participated in the strike unanimously. Their demands include increasing wages, improving treatment, and job security. The telephone company, on the other hand, said that only a part of the workers in the automatic machine room were on strike, which did not affect operations, and that the striking workers had not made any demands or notifications beforehand. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Course of the Strike: Since the Shanghai Telephone Company switched to automatic machines, it has reduced the number of workers many times, and the treatment has also been extremely difficult. In January of this year, there was brewing for a strike, and representatives were elected to contact the capitalists. Then the Shanghai war broke out, and it was shelved invisibly until now. A week ago, the workers once again made five demands to the capitalists, including increasing wages, improving treatment, and not dismissing workers. The capitalists did not give a satisfactory answer. Until 7:00 PM yesterday afternoon, when the workers on the night shift went to work, they suddenly announced a strike. The capitalists had not received any notice in advance.</p>
<p>Normal Telephone Calls: After the strike, none of the workers on the night shift went to the bureau to work, so the machine rooms and switchboards of the telephone bureaus in the British and French Concessions were unmanned. The bureau temporarily sent Western engineers to manage them. The telephone lines in the French Concession and the western district of the Public Concession were slightly damaged, causing temporary interruptions. All repairs were completed until 9:00 PM. Because the telephone is completely automatic, there were only more than 40 switchboard workers on the night shift in the entire city. Last night, each bureau was replaced by one or two Westerners, so telephone calls were still normal and were not affected by the strike.</p>
<p>Strike Declaration: The strike declaration of the workers of the Shanghai Telephone Company reads, "Workers and people of the whole of Shanghai, we telephone workers who are cruelly oppressed and exploited by the American imperialist Electric Trust. In order to increase profits, the capitalists desperately implement rationalized production, transform automatic machines, and lay off workers in large numbers. Every telephone worker feels extremely painful and can no longer bear it. In order to save our lives and livelihoods, we have united unanimously. There is really no second way except to wage a resolute struggle against the telephone capitalists. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan and all imperialists have intensified their attacks on China and divided China. The attacks by the so-called civilized American imperialist telephone capitalists on our telephone workers have become even more cruel. In the past few months, hundreds of our telephone workers have been dismissed and abandoned on the streets, and no one cares about them. Because many workers' families and houses were bombed and destroyed by Japanese imperialist planes and artillery during the Shanghai war, our telephone workers still disregarded their lives and worked as usual under the threat of artillery fire. Recently, the telephone capitalists wanted to dismiss more than 300 workers in June and hire White Russians to replace the work of Chinese workers. Not only did they dismiss workers in large numbers and increase work, but they also canceled the precedent of increasing wages in April every year, and also canceled Sunday work, etc. Many old employees who have worked in the company for more than ten or twenty years still have wages of only about 20 yuan. The savings that have been accumulated year by year are often deducted and confiscated by the capitalists for no reason. According to the workers in the engine room, the working hours are more than twelve hours. It is obvious that the more so-called 'civilized' and 'advanced' imperialist capitalists are, the more they are the most cruel vampires of our workers. Smart imperialist capitalists are afraid that we, the oppressed slaves, will rise up to fight, and have come up with many tricks to deceive us and oppress us, so that we all do not dare to move. All the worker traitors and running dogs have unanimously risen up to serve the capitalists, saying things like 'Don't strike if you are anti-imperialist', 'Don't be anti-imperialist if you strike', 'The imperialist capitalists have no choice but to dismiss workers', 'The telephone strike is disrupting the social order of Shanghai', and 'The telephone workers' struggle can only be waged after the whole of Shanghai's workers rise up to fight', etc., selling out the interests of the workers, dispersing our strength, and eliminating our struggle. The eighteen articles proposed by the trade union last year and the signature campaign initiated by the foreman recently have all become empty words on blank paper. This tells us that the peaceful method of not waging a fierce struggle against the capitalists has no result. It is helping the imperialist capitalists and selling out the interests of our workers. We telephone workers can no longer endure it. Past experiences have taught us that now we can only unite unanimously, rely on our own strength, and wage a resolute struggle against the imperialist capitalists to protect ourselves and improve our painful lives. Our purpose is to achieve our required conditions. We swear to resolutely implement a general strike to seek our victory, and not be subjected to any threats, oppression, deception, destruction, or devastation. We hope that all the workers and people of Shanghai will unanimously support us, and please provide assistance in spirit, material, and struggle strength. We, the workers of the whole of Shanghai, will work hand in hand on the same front to wage a resolute struggle against the imperialist capitalists. If our workers cannot endure it, we will definitely strike on June 7th. This is our declaration."</p>
<p>Demands: The strike conditions are as follows: (1) Oppose the dismissal of workers, oppose the increase of work, and restore the jobs of dismissed workers; (2) Increase wages uniformly for all workers, old and new (specific measures will be determined later), starting from April of this year; (3) Oppose the cancellation of Sunday work, and double the wages for work during holidays; (4) Return the savings to the employees for their own safekeeping; (5) Guarantee no dismissal when transferring jobs; (6) Pay wages as usual during sick leave, and do not dismiss workers after they recover; (7) The working hours of workers in the engine room should be the same as the working hours of ordinary workers; (8) Do not transfer workers in the automatic machine test lines to do odd jobs, such as sweeping the floor; (9) If the company needs to recruit employees, it should first be supplemented by unemployed telephone workers; (10) Oppose the employment of White Russians; (11) Oppose the telephone company increasing telephone charges to users.</p>
<p>Capitalist's Statement: A reporter from this newspaper interviewed Mr. Gail, the deputy director of the telephone company, last night. He said that the strike started at 7:00 PM and was only carried out by some workers on the night shift. There was no contact or notification with the authorities beforehand. As for the workers, they sent representatives to the authorities in January of this year to make some demands, but they have not been resolved. As for the purpose of the workers' demands, the company set up automatic machines, the need for employees is gradually decreasing, resulting in layoffs and deep anxiety, on the one hand, to increase wages, on the other hand, to require security, but in the company, in order to promote the general welfare of the people, so that users pay fees as much as possible to reduce, if the workers say, will use to increase the burden of telephone charges, and said that day shift workers whether to participate in the strike, did not dare to decide, because tomorrow (that is, today) is a holiday.</p>
<p>Company Notice: The Shanghai Telephone Company issued a notice last night stating that because some machine and switchboard workers have stopped working, users may experience slight delays when dialing 01 and 09, please forgive.</p>

<p>Marine Corps Inspected Yesterday: Uematsu, the commander of the Japanese naval marine corps, inspected the marine corps in Shanghai yesterday. The team of about 1,600 people, divided into infantry, tank team, howitzer team, machine gun team, gun carriage team, etc., gathered at Hongkou Park from Jiangwan Road to North Sichuan Road at 9:30 am. About 4,000 Japanese expatriates went to watch. At around 11:00 am, the team returned from North Sichuan Road to Wusong Road via Bazilu. The place where the army passed was guarded by armed marine corps, and pedestrians were generally prohibited. They could only pass after the army had passed.</p>
<p>Izumo Ship Scheduled to Leave Shanghai: Rear Admiral Shiozawa, commander of the First Overseas Dispatch Team of the Japanese Navy, has now been ordered to be reassigned as the director of the Naval Education Bureau. Rear Admiral Kikuno has been dispatched to succeed as the commander of the First Overseas Dispatch Team stationed in Shanghai. Also, the injuries of Nomura, commander of the Third Fleet, have gradually improved. Uematsu, commander of the Shanghai Marine Corps, has also been transferred back to his home country. Colonel Sugisaka has been appointed as his successor. Yesterday, the naval officers agreed to take the flagship Izumo ship on Saturday (11th) of this week and return to China. There are more than 700 naval personnel on the Izumo ship, who will also return to Japan with the ship at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e146">General Overview of Sino-American Trade <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Decline in Chinese Exports to America</p>
<p>Increase in American Exports to China</p>
<p>Reports from the mainland state that, according to the latest trade report released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Open Door policy in Manchuria has, in reality, been closed. In the first three months of this year, American goods exported to Dalian were valued at only USD 293,000, a 35% decrease compared to the USD 450,000 during the same period last year. Conversely, during the same period, American goods imported to China (excluding Manchuria) totaled USD 20,327,000, a 25% increase compared to the USD 16,300,000 during the first three months of last year. Overall, the U.S. import trade has seen a decline this quarter, leading to a 58% decrease in goods exported from mainland China to the United States compared to the same period last year, valued at only USD 7,440,000. (Translator's note: This is only slightly more than one-third of the value of American imports. In other words, China's import surplus is twice its export value. With money flowing out like this, how can the people not be impoverished and wealth depleted? It is hoped that those who love to use foreign goods will pay close attention.) However, goods exported from Dalian to the United States increased by 22% compared to the same period last year, valued at USD 351,000. Furthermore, the total value of U.S. exports in the first three months of this year was USD 459,150,000, a 34% decrease compared to the same period last year (excluding the 25% increase in exports to China). The total value of imports was USD 397,850,000, a 29% decrease compared to the same period last year (note that the decrease in imports from China is even greater, reaching 58%, further illustrating the decline in China's exports to the U.S.). Moreover, the total value of U.S. foreign trade last year decreased by 25% compared to the previous year, and by 15% in the Far East. However, exports to China, including Hong Kong and Dalian, increased by 1%, while imports from China, including Hong Kong and Dalian, decreased by 31%. If China proper, Hong Kong, and Dalian are statistically separated, then American goods imported to China proper last year increased by 9% compared to the previous year, while Chinese goods exported to the U.S. decreased by 33%. In Dalian, American goods imported decreased by 66%, while Chinese goods exported to the U.S. decreased by 54%. In Hong Kong, American goods imported decreased by 18%, while Chinese goods exported to the U.S. increased by 9%. Although the import of American goods to Dalian and Hong Kong decreased significantly, the value of goods exported to China proper far exceeded that of the two ports, so after summing up, the total value of American goods exported to China last year still increased by 1% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Shao Lizi's Letter to Wang Xiaolai</p>
<h3 id="e147">Planning the Development of Resources in Gansu Province <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Intending to Invite Entrepreneurs to Inspect</p>
<p>Shao Lizi, the chairman of Gansu Province, intends to devote effort to the development of resources in Gansu. Yesterday, he sent a letter to Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, requesting that he invite entrepreneurs from Shanghai to inspect the province and promote the sale of domestic goods in the Northwest. Wang has sent a letter inquiring about the methods of contact. The correspondence is recorded below:</p>
<p>Shao Lizi's Letter: Your telegram arrived very late. I am deeply grateful for your kind words and congratulations. With my limited talent, I have been entrusted with a heavy responsibility, and I rely on the support of wise men from across the country. Gansu Province has suffered frequent disasters, and the people are impoverished. Villages are ruined, and fields are barren. The misery is worse than in any other disaster area. However, the customs are simple and honest, and the resources are abundant, making development possible. Entrepreneurs from Shanghai who are willing to engage in agriculture, mining, wool, leather, and other industries are welcome to inspect. Moreover, the shops in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces are filled with foreign goods, mostly transported from Tianjin. If merchants of domestic goods in Shanghai could pay attention to sending more samples and indicating methods of wholesale purchase, I am confident that Shaanxi and Gansu provinces could provide a large market. I hope you will strongly promote this. Furthermore, I have written to Mr. Ziqiao, asking him to solicit donations for the Gansu Province work relief projects and for resettling refugees in villages. I also ask for your support when you meet with him.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Reply: I have just received your letter. I deeply lament the difficulty of implementing policies in the aftermath of the destruction in Gansu Province. I am also inspired by the fact that the Qin and Long regions were once called treasure troves, awaiting development. I hope that people from the Southeast can work together to preserve resources for the country and open up opportunities for the people. This is truly the intention of a virtuous man. I will carefully discuss this with the industrial and commercial circles here and start by encouraging merchants to send samples and try sales. However, I need to know who to contact, whether there are any merchants in Lanzhou who can be entrusted with trial sales, or whether I should simply discuss this with the Lanzhou Chamber of Commerce. This is a new venture, and I would appreciate it if you could provide clear guidance so that we can follow it. As for agriculture, mining, wool, leather, and other industries, can you provide some general information so that it will be easier to gather entrepreneurs to come to Gansu for inspection? I have already conveyed your wishes to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao. Respectfully replied.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th: After receiving Finance Minister Song's resignation, President Wang immediately consulted with Chairman Chiang and various ministers and decided to personally go to Shanghai to persuade him to stay. Originally scheduled to depart on the evening of the 6th, but due to meetings of the Executive Yuan and the Central Standing Committee on the 7th, the trip was changed to the night express train to Shanghai on the evening of the 7th. Before departing, he issued a statement: Song and Chen are both courageous in taking responsibility. Their resignation is not a deliberate act of negativity, but due to the difficulties of handling affairs, they have no choice. I sympathize with them greatly. Chiang also feels the same way. This trip to Shanghai is not only to earnestly persuade them to stay, but also to further discuss ways to make progress in the situation.</p>

Furthermore, formal approval has not yet been sought from the Chinese government. Therefore, he has not yet formally assumed office and does not wish to publicize it for the time being. However, when a reporter from Dalu Bao inquired with a senior Chinese official yesterday, it was said that the Chinese government approves of the Count's promotion to Minister. It is now heard that the credentials are already en route, and as soon as they arrive in Shanghai, Count Ciano will go to Beijing to present them and formally assume office.</p>

<p>Japanese Troops Do Not Withdraw, Thugs Are Not Eliminated</p>
<p>National Territory and Police Authority Should Not Be Ignored</p>
<p>The General Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Various Roads in North Shanghai submitted a letter to the municipal government requesting that the takeover committee be informed to negotiate the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Hujia Mu Bridge. The text is as follows: A petition requesting the prompt takeover of the Hujia Mu Bridge area to restore commerce and ensure the safety of the people. According to a report from Xing Minyi, a representative of the Fifth District Branch of our association, the Hujia Mu Bridge area is still within the area temporarily occupied by Japanese troops, which has led to the hiding of gangsters, hoodlums, traitors, and other villains, who harass, extort, and commit all kinds of crimes. Gambling is rampant without any restraint. Shops dare not open, and the people cannot live in peace. The Japanese soldiers are rarely seen, and even when there are three or five patrols, they turn a blind eye and do not interfere, allowing the villains to do as they please. Merchants and residents are eager for an early takeover to revive commerce. Please submit this to the takeover committee through your office to promptly take over the area. Based on this, we believe that the current situation in the area is extremely chaotic. If the police are not quickly dispatched to maintain order, the police force of the concession will inevitably take over, which concerns the national territory and police authority and should not be ignored. We request that your office inform the takeover committee to take over the area as soon as possible, dispatch police patrols, and maintain the livelihood of the people and revive commerce, which is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

<h3 id="e155">End of the Road for Traitors in the Zhenru District <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Strange Kidnapping Case Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>When the Zhenru district in western Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese army, a town resident named Shen Songge, acting on the instructions of the Japanese side, organized a maintenance association and willingly became a puppet. As a result, everyone despised him. On the 23rd of last month, when our takeover committee went to take over the area, Shen disappeared suddenly on the afternoon of the same day. This has been going on for many days. The Public Security Bureau, based on a report from Shen's wife, Li, that her husband had been kidnapped by the local defense force, had Chief Wen Yingxing order the Criminal Investigation Division to arrest Fu Zhongmin and others, members of the force. However, the merchants and residents of the town believed that those arrested were innocent and wrongly accused, so they went on strike to help them. After the head of the town's defense force, Wang Shouyu, and Municipal Committee Member Hong Lanxiang went to the municipal government to bail them out the other day, the matter was brought to an end. However, the kidnapping case of the traitor Shen Songge has not yet been resolved. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency went to Zhenru yesterday to investigate the matter. The information obtained is recorded below: The Process of the Traitor's Kidnapping: According to Shen Songge's wife, Li, when her husband was kidnapped, she was still living in Shanghai. The kidnapping occurred at 1:00 PM on the 23rd. At that time, Shen Songge was at his residence in Nanyangzhai, north of Zhenru Town, with an old servant. When he was kidnapped, dozens of armed and plainclothes members of the local defense force first went to Shen's residence, claiming to borrow a door panel. When they saw Shen, they immediately arrested him and took him away, heading east. When Shen's old servant saw this, he knew something was wrong and followed them, hoping to find out what was going on. However, after walking only a few steps, he was stopped at gunpoint by the defense force members, who threatened to arrest him as well. The servant had no choice but to walk to Shanghai to report everything to his mistress, Li.</p>
<p>Shen's Wife Goes to the Rescue: After Li was informed by the old servant, she was shocked and immediately walked from Shanghai to Zhenru with the old servant. However, it was already dark, and they could not continue west from Caojiadu due to the curfew, so they stayed overnight at a relative's house. The next morning, they continued to move forward and arrived in town. First, they went to the office of Municipal Committee Member Hong Lanxiang, but Hong had gone to Shanghai. Then, they went to see Wang Shouyu, the head of the town's defense force, and reported the details. However, Wang firmly denied that the members of the force had arrested Shen and had a conflict with Li. The two parted unhappily. Li then visited Municipal Committee Member Hong Lanxiang again, but to no avail. However, according to Li, Hong had said that the defense force would not do such a thing and could help investigate as a friend. They agreed to meet again in three days to hear the news. Li had no choice but to return to her residence in Shanghai. Three days later, she visited again, but still had no news from Hong. Helpless, she reported the details to Shi Jinzhang, the director of the Fourth District Third Precinct of the local Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau: There was also a reason for Li to report to the local Public Security Bureau. When Shen was arrested, his old servant had followed behind him. When a group of people surged out, they encountered the Ping'an Security Team stationed near the Zhenru railway station. Shen... shouted for help. The Ping'an Security Team... police... went to investigate... However, the defense... personnel... said this is... our business... you don't need to interfere... Your Director Shi... also knows about this. Therefore, Li went to report to the local precinct. However, Director Shi was not aware of this and was greatly surprised. He considered this a major matter and ordered Li to report to the Public Security Bureau in person. After Chief Wen heard about this, he believed that although the traitor was hateful, the local people could list the evidence and file a complaint with the authorities. How could they privately arrest him? Based on the report, he brought the witness and ordered the Criminal Investigation Division to arrest the related personnel, thus causing the strike in Zhenru Town.</p>
<p>Report from the Third Precinct of the Fourth District: Regarding this matter, a reporter from the Huadong News Agency went to investigate the Fourth Precinct Third Section. Director Shi Jinzhang was out, so they were received by Inspector Liu. According to Inspector Liu, the precinct was initially unaware of the incident when it occurred on the 23rd. After reporting, Director Shi visited Municipal Committee Member Hong Lanxiang. However, Hong claimed to be unaware of the matter. Later, the Pingjing police responsible for taking over the area reported witnessing the incident but were unable to stop it. Therefore, the clues in this matter are very suspicious. The precinct is now rigorously investigating the matter in the hope of finding out the truth.</p>
<p>A Bizarre Advertisement: After the incident, Shen Songge's wife, Li, received an anonymous letter from a kidnapper stating that the matter had nothing to do with the defense force and was done by their brothers. If they wanted Shen to return home safely, they had to pay a ransom of 30,000 yuan. The letter also stated that the contact method was to publish an advertisement according to the instructions in the letter. Li submitted the letter to the Public Security Bureau and was allowed to publish the advertisement. However, after it was published the other day, no one came to contact them, so Shen's whereabouts are still unknown. The wording of the advertisement is quite bizarre and is recorded below: "Nanyang Bamboo Shoot Company is buying genuine sweet soy sauce. If you have the above-mentioned goods, please send a letter to No. 2 Run'an Lane, Taiping Bridge, French Concession, stating the price, quantity, and the name and location of the contact person for our company to collect."</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Traitor's Residence: Shen Songge's being a traitor is something that everyone hates and abhors. However, his sudden disappearance is also puzzling. When Shen was in the puppet organization, he forcibly seized the property of nearby residents. His residence was filled with items belonging to nearby residents, and even items from the school were taken as his own. Yesterday, the reporter went to Shen's residence to inspect it. The doors and windows of Shen's house had been destroyed by the residents. There was also a seal on the door posted by the staff of the railway station, stating that Shen was not allowed to open the door without permission if he returned home and had to contact the railway station staff, because Shen's house contained items from the railway station. Shen's residence was quite clean, as he was one of the more affluent people in the area.</p>
<p>Mr. Hong Lanxiang's Talk: According to Municipal Committee Member Hong Lanxiang of Zhenru District, speaking to the Huadong News Agency, Shen's kidnapping was actually done by local thugs who had been victimized by Shen when the Japanese army occupied the area and were now retaliating. It had nothing to do with the defense force, and they were never involved. When the incident occurred, I was in Shanghai. Now, there are false accusations against the force, which is unfortunate. This is because a certain local organization is at odds with the defense force. I am now submitting a request to the municipal government for a thorough investigation. Mr. Hong also cited an incident to prove his point, saying that if the defense force members were going to make a secret arrest, why would they be fully armed, giving people an opportunity? Furthermore, I was very close to Shen. His coming to live in the town, buying land, and... were all handled by me. How could such a thing happen? One day, the truth of this case will come to light and clear the force of false accusations. The defense force management committee has also dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter because it is so important.</p>

<p>When the 19th Route Army resisted the Japanese, overseas Chinese in Myanmar formed a volunteer army to join the front line to resist foreign aggression for their motherland. The captain, Li Jianying, and more than 50 soldiers, all strong men from the overseas Chinese community, were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the Da Ma, a ship of the British India Company, on May 24. They had previously telegraphed the 19th Route Army. Later, due to incomplete departure procedures, they changed to the company's New Weiya postal ship from Yangon to Shanghai, arriving 14 days later than originally scheduled. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission received a telegram and sent a representative to Shanghai to welcome them. The army arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Liu Xiang of Sichuan yesterday, saying: "To Commander Liu, Chengdu: The entire Xikang province, due to the nation's misfortunes, has been continuously occupied by Tibetans for years, with nearly two-thirds of the territory lost. Since the Daba Temple incident, Luhuo has become precarious, and the defenses of Sichuan province are almost entirely dismantled, causing even greater concern for the west. The Deng Brigade, under your command, has recovered Ganzi and Zhanhua, one after another, slightly deterring the enemy's momentum. The people here are celebrating with joy. However, the Tibetans are still increasing their reinforcements, and every time we read telegrams from you and the people of Xikang requesting military pay and equipment, we are filled with endless anxiety. We believe that the number of troops in Sichuan province is the highest in the country, estimated by recent reports to be over 400,000. If you could request Commander Chengfu to dispatch two-tenths of these troops to guard the key passes of Xikang, the border would be as solid as the Great Wall. Rifles and rifle bullets can both be manufactured by the Chengdu Arsenal, making it easy to continuously replenish supplies. If there is no sense of 'this border' or 'that border' among comrades, then with the entire strength of Sichuan, there is no reason why the Tibetans cannot be resisted. Every time people here read telegrams of appeal in the newspapers, those who understand say it is like Confucius being cautious when facing a matter, while those who do not understand even criticize you for trying to evade responsibility after the fact. Now, in the three northeastern provinces, a great mistake has been made, and there is no way to recover it. Looking towards the southwest, please do not repeat the same mistake. We hope you will consider this. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce." Fish.</p>

<p>Telegraphs the Executive Yuan to Sincerely Retain Him</p>
<p>Sends Representatives to Personally Visit Minister Chen</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union recently heard that Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu had telegraphed the Executive Yuan to resign from all his concurrent positions.

The original telegram and letter are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Executive Yuan: "To President Wang of the Executive Yuan, National Government, Nanjing: Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu, amidst difficulties, took charge of communications, benefiting military and political affairs. In expanding party affairs, who expected him to resign? Reading the telegrams, his loyalty and righteousness overflow. Upon hearing the news, emotions surged. At this difficult time, the foundation awaits consolidation. The union workers earnestly request the Executive Yuan to consider our feelings and firmly retain him. We eagerly await your command. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union." Yu.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Discussing the Handling of Civil Enforcement Issues <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Recently, foreign newspapers have frequently reported on issues involving the Special District Court's handling of civil enforcement. A reporter interviewed Shen Jiayi, President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, about this matter. The conversation is recorded below: (Question) "Foreigners frequently complain about the Special District Court's handling of civil enforcement. What is the reason for this?" (Answer) "Enforcement is different from adjudication. Adjudication only investigates the facts and applies the law to seek a fair judgment. Enforcement, however, involves the defendant's financial resources, so adjudication is often easier than enforcement. This is not unique to China; it is the same in all countries. China's litigation law is modeled after the continental law system and adopts a three-trial system. Cases that go through two or three trials will naturally take a long time. If the defendant has not reached the level of bankruptcy and the plaintiff has not requested the court to declare provisional execution, provisional attachment, or provisional disposition according to the law, the defendant's property will not be subject to any restrictions. Those who intend to avoid enforcement can secretly transfer their property. This is also one of the difficulties of enforcement, which is unavoidable even in countries with more complete legal systems. In China, due to the incomplete registration and notarization systems, private property is even easier to conceal. These are all major reasons for the difficulty of enforcement. However, these are all related to the system or special circumstances, not to the court's inefficiency. I deeply know that the importance of judgment lies in enforcement, especially in swift enforcement. More than ten years ago, when I was the president of a local court, I felt that this matter should be given special attention, so I created a civil enforcement office to take on this responsibility. Since the establishment of the National Court, I have paid even more attention to this matter and have repeatedly instructed civil enforcement personnel to pay close attention to various practical matters to maintain the interests of creditors who have received judgments and to make judgments have consequences. Regarding the system, the Ministry of Judicial Administration is currently working on reforming the civil procedure and civil enforcement system, hoping to streamline procedures and benefit the parties involved." (Question) "Recently, foreigners have criticized the court, saying that there is unfairness in handling civil cases. Does the court have this issue?" (Answer) "As the president of the court, I do not want to argue about this kind of argument. However, China's current laws are all adopted from Europe and the United States, and judges must make judgments based on the law. Moreover, according to China's litigation law, a judgment must be written, listing the facts and reasons for the judgment. If there is anything inappropriate, it is easy to point it out. Therefore, it is not easy for a judge to make judgments with prejudice. If, within the scope of the law, the judge's judgment is favorable to the plaintiff or favorable to the defendant, it is extremely difficult to determine an absolute standard. It is too vague to simply say it is unfair. I very much hope that those who have doubts can cite specific judgments and ask legal scholars to publicly evaluate them, which would be very beneficial. In the past, foreign nationals in China sometimes used political power to achieve results in civil cases that exceeded the power of the law, such as civil cases in the old Mixed Court, where judgments were often final after only one trial, and debtors were detained even before a judgment was made. This is one example. This kind of effect is, of course, impossible to obtain in today's courts, which base their judgments and enforcement on the law. It would be a misunderstanding and even a suspicion of using politics to subjugate the law to blame the court for this inconvenience. Although the legal system may not be perfect, according to what I know, the Ministry of Justice is now working hard to carry out reforms to make it as perfect as possible. This is what I dare to announce to people both inside and outside the country."</p>

<p>Retaining the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Labor Unions previously sent Chen Xiufu and twelve others to Suzhou to participate in the memorial service for the martyrs of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. On the same day, they went to the headquarters of the 19th Route Army to petition for them to be stationed in the original defense of Beijing and Shanghai in preparation for the Japanese invaders. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. They then united with people from all walks of life in Suzhou and Wuxi to jointly work to retain the 19th Route Army. On the 4th, they went to Beijing together with Suzhou petition representatives Qiu Kunchang, Fan Junbo, and Xia Xuejun, and Wuxi representatives Ding Shaochu, Mao Gongming, and Chen Huang. On the 6th, they submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Military Commission, and the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting the revocation of the order. The Military Commission sent Shao Jun as a representative to meet with them because the Chairman was inspecting the 87th Division. He agreed to submit a proposal to the Military Commission meeting on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss remedial measures to prevent the people from all over the world from being disappointed. Chen Kuan saw the representatives on behalf of President Wang of the Executive Yuan. He stated that the order for the 19th Route Army to enter Jiangxi to suppress bandits was issued by the Military Commission. The reason for sending the 19th Route Army was entirely because the mountains in Jiangxi were difficult and the 19th Route Army was skilled in mountain warfare and had strong combat capabilities. He hoped to eliminate the bandits in Jiangxi as soon as possible and therefore ordered the troops to be transferred. Regarding the rumors that this was a bargaining chip with the Japanese, the Executive Yuan could responsibly state that this was absolutely not the case. Each of the representatives asked that President Wang agreed to submit the matter to the Executive Yuan for discussion. Vice Minister Kuan saw the representatives on behalf of the Ministry of Military Affairs and agreed to have the Ministry of Military Affairs request the Military Commission and the Executive Yuan to, to the greatest extent, allow a portion of the 19th Route Army to remain stationed to appease the people in various places. The representatives will go to various regions to report on the process of the petition. It is reported that the Federation of Labor Unions will expand the movement and work with all sectors of society to petition again in order to achieve the goal of retaining the 19th Route Army.</p>

<p>Recent News from the Xinwei Relief Society</p>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces and the Temporary Relief Association for Refugees in the War Zone, considering that the matters of emergency relief for flood disasters and relief for refugees had temporarily come to an end, jointly decided to announce their dissolution. However, given that there are still many displaced disaster victims and news of disasters in various provinces is constantly being heard, causing great pain and suffering, it was deemed inappropriate to simply ignore them. Therefore, a joint meeting of the two associations decided to organize the Xinwei Relief Society, which was officially established on June 1st to continue handling relief matters. The following information is recorded below:</p>
<p>Declaration: "The country is in trouble, and disasters are frequent. Floods are rampant, and foreign insults arrive. Those who are displaced have no one to turn to, and the flames of war come to an end. Alas, our children suffer this catastrophe. We are angry and heartbroken. We have established the Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces and the Shanghai Temporary Relief Association for Refugees in the War Zone, regardless of our limited resources. The Emergency Relief Association has allocated relief funds to nineteen provinces and cities, and the Relief Association has helped over 300,000 refugees. All of this relies on the enthusiastic assistance and generous contributions of people from all walks of life, which has made this charitable act possible. We are deeply grateful for this. Now that the emergency relief has been completed and the Shanghai war has ended, the two associations should be dissolved as soon as possible. Therefore, a joint general meeting was held, and it was unanimously agreed that the disasters, although said to be destiny, are actually due to poor human planning. Past relief efforts were all after-the-fact repairs, which were not very helpful. Therefore, learning from the past and being cautious in the future, rather than moving firewood after the disaster has arrived, it is better to bend the chimney in advance. Moreover, there are currently nearly 2,000 refugees in the relief association who have no home to return to, and the relief work in provinces that have not been completed by the Emergency Relief Association also needs to be properly planned. Therefore, the Xinwei Relief Society was initiated to eliminate passive methods and draw up a fundamental plan, based on loving people with virtue and helping people with law, so that they can each do their best and each achieve their lives. It is hoped that we can prepare for a rainy day and avoid digging a well when thirsty. However, this matter is significant, and we are willing to do our best, but we still hope that fathers, brothers, sisters, and aunts will have great compassion and provide spiritual and material support, so that planting melons will lead to melons and planting beans will lead to beans, believing in the evidence of cause and effect, and descending blessings and good fortune, surely rewarding those who give. We hereby declare, please consider carefully."</p>
<p>Articles of Association: "(Article 1) The purpose of this association is to provide relief to disaster-stricken compatriots using active methods so that they can each achieve their lives. (Article 2) This association will continue to handle relief matters from the Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces and the Shanghai Temporary Relief Association for Refugees in the War Zone in the Xinwei year. Therefore, it is named the Xinwei Relief Society. (Article 3) This association is initiated and organized by people from various charitable and public welfare organizations in Shanghai. Those who agree with the purpose of this association are all members of this association. (Article 4) The organization of this association is as follows: Executive Group, Audit Group, and Finance Group. Each group has a director and a deputy director, who are appointed by the board of directors. The organizational regulations and detailed rules of procedure will be determined separately. (Article 5)</p>
<p>This association may appoint several secretaries to handle various affairs. (Article 6) This association will hold a general meeting of members once a year, a board of directors meeting once a quarter, and a standing board of directors meeting once a month. Special meetings may be convened when necessary. (Article 7) The operating expenses and administrative expenses of this association will be raised by this association at any time. (Article 8) All income and expenditure of funds and goods will be publicly announced in the newspaper at any time. (Article 9) These articles of association will be reported to the National Government Relief Commission for record after being resolved by the general meeting. (Article 10) These articles can be changed.</p>

<p>Trafficable by September 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway is an important highway for developing the industry and military transportation of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The National Government has ordered the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to build it as soon as possible. The construction of the road is now largely complete.

<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau Dispatches Personnel Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in order to prevent the import and manufacture of inferior man-made fertilizers, is strictly enforcing import and export inspections in accordance with ministerial orders. Since the implementation, it has achieved considerable results. However, it is feared that unscrupulous merchants may privately transport them to avoid inspection, or mix in impurities and inferior quality after inspection, seeking exorbitant profits and harming farmland. In order to strictly prevent this abuse, the Bureau has specially dispatched inspectors from today (the 8th) to Wenzhou, Haimen, Ruian, Pingyang, Shipu, Haiyou, Ninghai, Dinghai, Yuhuan, Chumen, Wenling, Ningbo, Zhenhai, Fenghua, Cixi, Yuyao, Shaoxing, Zhoushan, Baiguan, Shangyu, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Haining, Changxing, Hangzhou, Fuyang, Tonglu, Yuhang, Lanxi, Jinhua, Yongkang, and Anjiang counties in Zhejiang Province, and various counties in Jiangsu Province, to conduct inspections. At the same time, the Bureau has sent letters to local governments, requesting their assistance in the process.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Yeh Shan-tao Director Issue <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Another Interrogation Yesterday</p>
<p>Evidence Still Needs to be Investigated</p>
<p>Following the death of Huang Chu-chiu, the day and night banks belonging to the Gongfa Company founded by him successively went bankrupt. Creditors Zhang Zhengji, Zhu Chengfei, Dong Longxing, Chen Kaifu, and others learned that Yeh Shan-tao, famous for his real estate business, was also one of the Gongfa directors. They demanded that he bear responsibility for the debts, but Yeh denied it, citing a letter Huang Chu-chiu wrote to him during his lifetime approving his resignation as director as proof. However, Zhang and others did not believe it and claimed that the letter was forged by Yeh to evade responsibility. They jointly sued Yeh for forging documents in court. The initial trial concluded that the plaintiffs' evidence was insufficient and found Yeh not guilty. The plaintiffs were unwilling to accept this and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After repeated hearings, the investigation of witnesses could not be completed quickly, so the trial has not yet concluded. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu of the Second High Court and two prosecutors, Zhao and Guo, held another hearing. The creditors attached great importance to the proceedings and hired the Bingxun Stenography Team to record the proceedings for reference. However, Zhang Zhengji and Zhu Chengfei, two of the appellants, suddenly deviated from the approach taken by Dong and Chen. Their lawyers, Dong Yu and Bian Jialu, filed a separate petition to withdraw the appeal. Therefore, these two men did not appear in court yesterday. Only the lawyers for Dong and Chen, Yan Luqing, and the opposing party appeared. Witness Gan Yuesong also arrived as summoned. Judge Yu first handed Yeh's letter from Huang Chu-chiu to Gan for review and asked if the letter was in Huang's handwriting. According to Gan, although the two letters were from Huang Chu-chiu to him, they were probably not written by Huang himself, but by his secretary. Yeh Shan-tao previously asked me for letters from Huang, so I gave them to him. I did not expect them to be used in a lawsuit. Then, lawyer Yan presented a postal receipt, saying that it proved that Huang Chu-chiu's secretary Wu Meichun and Yeh had been in contact and that Yeh knew Wu's current address. The judge then asked Yeh where Wu was, but Yeh insisted that he did not know. He also stated that he was indeed a director when Huang Chu-chiu operated the exchange, but he resigned when the exchange went bankrupt. Although Huang still hired him as a director of the Gongfa Company afterward, he never took office and the money he received each month was actually travel expenses for his role as a consultant, etc. Lawyer Yan then stood up and continued, saying that in order to prove that Yeh was a director, in addition to the existing evidence, they should request the accountants Wu Cheng and Pan Zhaobang to provide the minutes of the board meetings, as the lawyers had recently discovered that the appellant had signed "present" in those minutes. At this time, Yeh's lawyer, Lu Shaozong, felt that the appellants were making requests at every hearing, which was causing complications and delaying the proceedings. He therefore asked the judge to order the opposing party to submit any other requests they had at the same time, so as to avoid further complications in the future. There was then some debate between the two sides. As a result, the hearing was adjourned pending further investigation of evidence.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Request to Abolish the Hard Fuel Business Tax <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Letter from the New West District Business Association to the Taxpayer Association</p>
<p>The New West District Twelve-Road Business Association of the French Concession yesterday sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayer Association of the French Concession regarding the newly promulgated hard fuel business tax by the French Municipal Council. The letter stated: "We are writing to inform you that members of our association, including Jin Shun, Yong Mao, Xin Da, Dexing, He Xin, Zhang Kunhe, Xin Shun, Sen Shun, and Hong Da coal shops, have successively reported that the French Municipal Council has promulgated regulations on the hard fuel business tax, requiring all coal shops within the French Concession dealing with hard fuel to pay three yuan every six months and that special officers have notified them that collection will begin immediately, otherwise they will be subject to penalties. We are greatly surprised by this. Our members operate shops in the French Concession and pay huge amounts in municipal taxes. The council's sudden promulgation of these regulations and the imposition of this exceptional tax is truly unaffordable. We request that you forward this matter to the French Municipal Council and work towards its abolition." According to this, we have learned that the reason for the French Municipal Council's new regulations is to address the issue of coal being displayed along the roads. However, the members of our association are not roadside coal stalls but legitimate shops, and should not be subject to these regulations. The council disregards everything and uses this as an excuse to levy an extra special tax on shops, which is completely unreasonable. Therefore, we are writing to your esteemed association, requesting that you promptly forward this matter to the French Concession Municipal Council and abolish this harsh tax to maintain commerce, for which we will be publicly grateful. Sincerely, To Chairman and Committee Members Du and Cheng of the Chinese Taxpayer Association of the French Concession, Zhang Gengshan, Chairman of the New West District Twelve-Road Business Association of the French Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Repercussions of the Stamp Bureau's Inspection of Soda Water <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Guild Announces Temporary Suspension of Soda Water Sales</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette and Candy Trade Association issued a notice to members who also sell soda water, stating, "We have recently received reports from members such as Shen Wan Cheng of Tasha Bridge and Chen Defeng of Ninghe Road that they have been detained by the tax bureau for selling soda water without stamps. We have already sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to write to the tax bureau to argue our case. It has been determined that the stamp tax should be collected directly from the factories that manufacture the soda water, in accordance with the method of taxing at the factory. Cigarette and candy shops are retailers and should not be responsible for paying the stamp tax. Now the bureau is not taxing at the factory, and it is strictly prohibiting sales, allowing tax-free soda water to be transported in, and then suddenly sending officers to inspect retail shops and detaining those who do not have stamps. Soda water in the concession does not require stamps, but Chinese areas do, which is clearly unfair. Moreover, no notice was published in the newspaper or issued by the guild before the inspection was carried out, and no detention receipt or fine slip was given after the goods were seized. This is close to harassment, and there are many irregularities. Our guild has thousands of members, and many of them also sell soda water. How can we tolerate such harassment? Therefore, we are notifying you to temporarily suspend the sale of soda water until a satisfactory solution is reached, and to return all soda water in your shops to the original factory. We will resume business when the tax bureau has clearly defined the regulations, so as to avoid harassment. If you disobey and are seized by the bureau, the guild will not be responsible. This matter concerns your vital interests, so please do not ignore it. We hereby notify you."</p>

<h3 id="e179">Plague Cattle Discovered in the Western Suburbs <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Farmers Seek Divine Guidance</p>
<p>Police Station Sends Police to Stop Them</p>
<p>Plague cattle (commonly known as "scraping intestines yellow") have recently been discovered in the towns and villages of the Hongqiao and Meilong areas of western Shanghai. It is currently the time for farmers to sow seeds, and they rely entirely on plowing cattle for work. Now that this disease has occurred, and there are no veterinarians in the countryside to treat it, the generally ignorant villagers are rushing to seek divine guidance, even knocking on Taibao, dispelling astral deities, and engaging in all sorts of superstitious activities, which is laughable. The local Municipal Public Security Bureau has learned of this and sent police to stop it, and has arrested and interrogated the so-called "immortal" (i.e., witch) who was spouting nonsense.</p>
<h3 id="e180">British Assessor Hears Hadow Estate Case <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The case of the Jewish millionaire Hadow's estate was heard by British Assessor Graham at the court on the morning of the 6th. After the court session began, British lawyer Samuel, representing Isaac Hadow of Mumbai, suddenly claimed that his client was a close relative of the late Hadow and requested the court to allow him to join Hadow's wife as a defendant to oppose the plaintiff, Ishlah Hadow. The assessor rejected the request. The hearing continued yesterday morning. Lawyer Samuel defended Isaac Hadow of Mumbai for a while. Then, the British Consul of Shanghai, Davidson, presented various documents copied from old cases in the British Consulate General, and Hadow's wife's lawyer, Pu De, asked the consul a few questions about the documents. The evidence disputed by the lawyers on both sides yesterday morning was the nationality of the late Hadow. The defendant's lawyer proved that Hadow and his sister's father had become British subjects in India after their birth, and also proved that when Hadow's property in Hangzhou was confiscated by the Chinese authorities in 1927, the British government handled the negotiations for him. He also stated that the deceased had been awarded the Third Class Chia-ho Decoration by the Chinese government during his lifetime, which was approved by the British Emperor. All of this was sufficient to prove that the late Hadow was a British subject. The plaintiff's lawyer presented genealogical and other evidence to prove that the deceased was actually an Iraqi. The court session resumed in the afternoon, and there was a dispute over Samuel's status.</p>

<p>He Rong, a native of Haizhou, living at No. 591, Baohua Lane, East-West Huade Road, was a sailor on the French mail ship "Atos." He recently came to Shanghai, berthing at the China Merchants Bureau dock in Hongkou. On the 3rd of this month, the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a secret report stating that someone was smuggling a large number of firearms on the ship. They dispatched detectives along with river police to arrest the person involved, Zhong, and seized 26 handguns and 2,900 rounds of ammunition. Zhong then confessed that He was also an accomplice. On the morning of the day before yesterday, the Public Security Bureau sent detective Wang Jiheng to the Huishan Concession Police to request assistance in the arrest. The head of the patrol ordered detective Li Hongsheng to arrest He Rong. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Qiao questioned him. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case, briefly stating that the defendant was also on the ship at the time and, seeing that the matter had been exposed, took the opportunity to escape. However, the Public Security Bureau did not bring the criminal Zhong to the court today. The detective then explained the previous situation and presented the official letter for inspection, requesting a transfer. After Judge Qiao questioned the defendant briefly, he ordered He Rong to be handed over to the detectives to be taken back for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Five Robbers Repeatedly Commit Major Robberies <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The Huishan Concession Police recently received a report that robbers were hiding on Longjiang Road, Yangshupu. They dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest five Jiangbei natives, Bian Rongliang, Bian Rongchang, Liu Zhaofeng, Wang Yongfa, and Shao Peirong, and recovered a handgun and seven rounds of ammunition discarded by the robbers. They were sent to the First Special District Local Court for investigation. It is now learned that the five robbers were accomplices of Feng Xiao Wu Zi, who was recently arrested by the Huishan Concession Police. According to the police investigation, the robbers had successively used weapons to rob the cigarette and paper shop at No. 144 Pingliang Road, the southern goods shop at No. 64 Huade Road, the residents at No. 503-504 Meizhou Road, and a shed in that area. The amount of property stolen was quite large. Yesterday morning, Chinese and Western detectives summoned the victims and witnesses and sent the robbers and ammunition to the First Special Court. Judge Wu Tingqi questioned them and then, because police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the circumstances of the case were complicated, requested a postponement of the trial. Judge Wu then approved the postponement and set the trial for the afternoon of June 15th. The defendants will remain in custody for the time being.</p>

<p>Patriotic Performance by the National Music Research Society</p>
<p>The Depiction by Ms. Qin and Ms. Xie is Exquisite</p>
<p>Suppressing the invading Japanese pirates is one of the most glorious pages in Ming Dynasty history for resisting foreign aggression.  Chinese people have recently begun to recall this event in historical records, but the details are not well known.  Xiantan Yuyin used records from the History of the Ming Dynasty as scripting material.  Once completed, it was named "Pacifying the Bandits in the Ming Dynasty."  On the day after the opening of the Brahma Temple Club, members of the National Music Research Association performed it on the fourth floor of the Continental Emporium.  It included both literary and martial elements, as well as Kunqu and other types of opera. The plot was complete and beautiful.  Scenes such as "Defending the City" and "Training the Troops" expressed the great righteousness of defending the homeland and the power of the people.  It used the past to satirize the present, causing people to wake up suddenly.  The "Homesickness" and "Persuading Surrender" scenes expressed how patriotic women helped their motherland in humiliating circumstances.  Madam Qin and Madam Xie, who played the women in the play, portrayed the patriotic psychology with meticulous care, and their expressions were wonderful.  Moreover, the wording was elegant and refined, which was a bonus.  On that day, all the guests were deeply moved by the play, applauding and praising it, and hoping that it would be performed continuously so that people at sea could enjoy a visual feast and promote patriotic ideas, making the Chinese people more courageous in serving the country.</p>

<p>The Xiangmao Soap Company has newly launched an Ax Brand soap, the quality of which is comparable to the long-famous Xiangmao Beiji soap, but the price is uniquely low. Therefore, although it is newly created, its sales are extremely strong, and it is almost impossible to keep up with demand. The key is that the soap is inexpensive, of high quality, and has something to offer. It is said that the soap is currently exclusively distributed by Zheda Hao, located at 261 Shandong Road.</p>

<p>Dou Wenjin, detective number 80 of the French Concession Police, lost a wallet on the 6th of this month while out on official business. Inside was a detective license issued by the French Chief Inspector, which disappeared without a trace. In addition to reporting to the Chief Inspector and reissuing a new license to perform his duties, there is concern that the old license may be lost outside and picked up by bad people, leading to impersonation and deception. If people from all walks of life encounter this, it is hoped that they will immediately hand them over to the nearest police station for prosecution.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Big Shots and Farts in That Country <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Du Liao</p>
<p>In the past, after a certain prime minister in that country was assassinated and lay ill in the hospital, the people of the country were very worried, especially the cabinet ministers, who went to inquire about his illness day after day, so many that it was overwhelming. With great difficulty, the prime minister farted, and everyone believed that his illness had taken a turn for the better, not only putting their hands on their foreheads in relief, but even raising champagne and reciting a poem to celebrate. This was seen in a Shanghai newspaper, but I am a little hazy about the year and month. It probably wasn't that long ago!</p>
<p>Recently, when a certain general died, the report said that he farted three times and then breathed his last. The effects of farting are very different from the prime minister's fart. The prime minister's fart was the harbinger of a turn for the better, while the general's fart was the final sound of an incurable disease. At this moment, the people sending him off probably couldn't put their hands on their foreheads in relief. Even more so, they couldn't raise champagne and recite a poem to celebrate. Perhaps the eulogy could use the line: "With three farts, he became a final sound, alas, may you enjoy this offering!"</p>
<p>I read in the History of the Song Dynasty that a great and loyal subject of China called out "Cross the river!" three times as he lay dying. I read in the newspaper that a great and loyal subject of that country farted three times as he lay dying. One Chinese and one foreign loyal subject, both died with a "three"! I can then hum a classical Chinese sentence, calling it "Alas! This fart is eternal!"</p>
<h3 id="e196">Biography of Jin Dehai <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Chang</p>
<p>Jin Dehai was a man from Shandong. He was strong and powerful. He once angrily threw a man ten zhang away. Bandits did not dare to look directly at his village. He rose from a common soldier to become a squad leader in the 19th Army. In every battle, he would be wounded. And his wounds were always serious. He said, "If I am not wounded, I cannot show that I am not a coward. If my wounds are not serious, I cannot show that I am brave." When suppressing the Red bandits in Jiangxi, his achievements were particularly remarkable. When the Japanese bandits invaded our Northeast, he was so angry that he coughed up blood. He wept and begged to go beyond the border. When this was refused, he coughed up blood again, as if he had suffered a stroke. Every day, he would tie up grass to resemble bandits, holding a broadsword, cursing and striking until he was exhausted. Someone tried to advise him, but he angrily said, "My blood is boiling! If I do not use it to kill bandits, I would rather cough up blood and die! However, I will not spill my useful blood in a useless place. Enough, enough! I shall eventually find a place to exhaust my blood!" This year, when the Shanghai Incident occurred, he was ordered to guard the temple and maintain order. Jin was overjoyed. He strongly requested to be in the vanguard and repeatedly made contributions. Once, he was accidentally wounded. Fearing that the doctor would find out and stop him from killing bandits, he secretly hid the wound in his clothes. On March 1st, our army withdrew from the Songhu Defense Line. The soldiers gathered to pack their bags. Jin alone squatted in a large trench, refusing to leave. As the sound of guns and cannons drew near, they urged him. Weeping, he said, "My chest and abdomen have already been hit by seven bullets. Even if I leave, I will not survive. Why not kill a few more bandits before I die?" Then, he took out several large explosive devices and put them on, calmly loaded his gun, waved his hand, and sang loudly to send the army off. Even a mile away, the echo could still be heard, stirring the air. Everyone who heard it shed tears for him. And Jin never returned.</p>
<p>Wang Dichang said: This was told to me by my student, He Yisheng. Yisheng heard it from Zhu Zichao, battalion commander of the 19th Army. Jin was under Zichao's command. Zichao said that when he spoke of this, tears streamed down his face. He said that losing ten territories could still be recovered, but how could one recover the loss of such a soldier? Alas!</p>

<p>Nights in May are even more filled with the romantic, mysterious, and fleshy world. Dazzling electric lights and charming signs adorn the dilapidated ancient city, making it exceptionally young. Movie theaters, cafes, and dance halls all have lipstick-covered lips, stocking-clad legs, curved eyebrows, curved waists, and a kind of fragrance that can be smelled but not described.

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>A Machine to Stop Snoring. Snoring after falling asleep is a very common thing. But in European and American countries, it is considered annoying. Some American couples have even filed for divorce because of snoring. This shows the extent to which they abhor snoring. So inventors racked their brains and came up with a machine to stop snoring. It was recently registered with the patent office and granted a patent. This machine is a transmitter, very similar to the transmitters used in radio broadcasting stations, but smaller. Before going to bed, you adjust it and place it next to your pillow, so that it corresponds to the snoring sound. After you fall asleep, the sawing-like snoring sound erupts, louder and louder, more and more intense. At that time, the transmitter will honestly start working. There is a needle in the machine that will pop out and poke the snorer, making them alert. If you don't want to use an electric needle, there is also a method: change it to a slight electric-like vibration, and the snoring will stop.</p>
<p>...and speaking of that dark and beloved Central Park.</p>
<p>Central Park is engraved in the heart of every young person with a deep impression. There are paths lined with flowers, there are also large tea fields, and there are forests where lovers appear and disappear. When the stars are twinkling in the sky like ghostly eyes, and the gas lamps tactfully shrink into the leaves,</p>
<p>On every pulse of Central Park, there is a mountain torrent-like crowd flowing, all of them are coming with sexual hunger to seek their object of satisfaction.</p>
<p>The sound of lips and lips, flesh and flesh colliding can be heard anytime, anywhere, especially that "not new, someone has to come..." This kind of false refusal is the most capable of plucking people's heartstrings and causing them to tremble wildly.</p>
<p>"Let's go sit at my house?" "Or you come to my house." "Aren't you going back tonight?" "Not today..." In this joyful dialogue, single people come in and go out in pairs, a pair of couples coming out and going into the clouds, going out to do something? This is something everyone can imagine.</p>
<p>But people who visit the park can't always be so lucky, so after pairs go out, there are always some loners left. These loners go in alone and come out alone. As they walk past the long Chang'an Street, only one shadow accompanies them. But they are not disappointed, because they can come again tomorrow, so they all eagerly look forward to tomorrow.</p>

<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>The Shanghai Incident was caused by Japanese monks. This is known to everyone. It is said that these monks came from overseas last year and were stationed at a certain temple in Qujiaqiao. They wore tall hats and white wide shirts, and often walked through the streets ringing their religious instruments. Passersby were drawn to them. One of the monks was a friend of Mr. Wenlanting. I once approached him and asked, "Sir, your teachings have spread throughout the country. How did you suddenly include the Isles of the Immortals? What do you think of this?" The gentleman said, "The Buddha's teachings are equal, aiming at universal harmony. Therefore, there are no national boundaries in religion. This monk worships the Lotus Transformation Sect. The words he recites are all prayers for peace." Now, north of the Shanghai Bund, these monks of Gautama sought to bestow peace, but instead provoked war. The people suffered calamity, and their homes were turned into ruins. Our merciful Buddha, hearing of this, should lower his eyebrows and put his palms together, saying, "The karmic obstacles of sentient beings have not yet been exhausted. They have no opportunity to hear this Dharma sound. Paradise has turned into hell." Good, good.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Record of the Qiyang World Cultural Relics Exhibition (Part 2) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— K</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Guixin studies Chinese construction. He seeks evidence of modern architecture. Therefore, he pays attention to the literature of old families. His discovery of the cultural relics of the Qiyang family actually began with a picture of Pacifying the Barbarians and two fragments of rhinoceros armor. The picture depicts the style of Western houses, which coincides with the records in ancient books. And the rhinoceros armor is enough to examine the evolution of lacquer work. Further, he inquired about its origin. He learned that it came from the Li family. The 21st generation descendant, Guoshou, currently lives in Beijing. Fearing the turmoil of the world, and knowing that the Zhu family was dedicated to preserving documents, he also generously produced his collection, including images, tomb maps, family trees, and contracts.</p>
<p>...All were entrusted to be affiliated, provided for their examination and revision. These various things, coming from the remaining moths and dust seals of hundreds of years, were scattered and broken, almost too fragile to touch. Therefore, he gathered colleagues, separately stitched them together, sought good craftsmen to carefully repair them, aiming to restore them to their original state without losing their truth. He also opened boxes and displayed books, arranging and comparing them one by one. Only then did the 600-year history of the Li family clearly emerge. The lost writings and anecdotes of historical records have also found their place.</p>
<p>He encountered many difficulties and setbacks. For more than half a year, he gradually got on track. The surviving members of the Li family in Mingguang, the original home, heard about it and sent letters to inquire, saying that they had long heard that the branch in Beijing had hidden relics, which they had been seeking for decades but could not find. They felt fortunate that they were now being made public. At that time, the Zhu family was also serving in the south of the country, personally going to the old cemetery of Qiyang to inspect and verify, and felt even more that the cultural relics of the Li family were of great historical value. At that time, scholars from both the north and the south were happy and willing to see them. This is the origin of the current public exhibition.</p>
<p>The reason why relics of old families cannot be preserved for long is mostly because the entrustment and supervision are not in the right place. Although the descendants of the Li family are meagerly living in humble alleys, they are willing to offer them for the research of contemporary scholars, not for their own selfish gain. How can their knowledge and judgment be surpassed? Moreover, there are further expectations. Among the tall trees in the country, there must still be many people who can collect the documents of their ancestors from the ashes of destruction. One must know that the trend of the times is that only publicity can transmit them for a long time. If they can hear the news and rise up, advancing to benefit the glory of national history, and retreating to highlight the hidden brilliance of their ancestors, how can their magnificence be limited? When voices call for voices, and qi seeks qi, we should wait expectantly.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Two Righteous Dogs <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Mi</p>
<p>The Japanese bandits invaded Shanghai, ravaging several counties. Those displaced and destitute numbered more than a million. Wherever the guns and cannons passed, houses were turned into ruins. The cruelty and inhumanity were rarely seen in history. And the heartless and mad traitors still took the opportunity to stir up trouble, willingly acting as accomplices, which is infuriating.</p>
<p>My home is east of Lou River. During the Battle of Jiazilu in Qi Lu, it was repeatedly subjected to the edge of swords. Only the courtyard remained. In recent years, it has been repaired and gradually restored to its former appearance. When the Japanese bandits invaded, the whole family moved away. We had two dogs, but we did not have time to take them with us, so we left them there. When the bandits arrived, they saw that my house was spacious and the flowers and trees were lush, so they occupied it with hundreds of people for three months. When the bandits left, the villagers all returned. I also returned to inspect, only to find that the house was empty. Even the flowers and trees in the courtyard could not escape. The distance from the Jiazilu battle cannot be measured in miles. At that time, a neighbor who had witnessed the Japanese bandits' invasion said to me, "When the bandits invaded and occupied your house, the two dogs guarded the house and did not leave. The bandits gave them food, but they did not eat it. When they were hungry, they would eat at the farmhouses of neighboring villagers. They are righteous dogs." I couldn't help but feel emotional. Therefore, I record this matter to make it known to all. Those who willingly collude with the enemy and assist the bandits are truly inferior to these two dogs. (Unpaid)</p>

<p>Chapter 9: Attaching a Special Car to Expel Guests with False Alarm, Sitting Coldly in an Official Office Becomes a Distant Thought</p>
<p>All kinds of arrangements took two full days to complete. Because I was busy with other things, and because I didn't want to make it public, I didn't inform any of my other friends. Only Wei Zhuomou invited them to a farewell dinner. On the evening of the third day, Mao Deshun came again, panting, and said that they would definitely set off tonight. So, he carried his luggage and brought his entourage, dividing them into two cars and heading to Ye's residence. As soon as the Fifth Madam met An Yutian, she took out a letter of appointment, saying that this was a temporary appointment from her brother-in-law as a councilor. The commander-in-chief left it here. An Yutian first thanked the Fifth Madam. The Fifth Madam instructed, "When the commander-in-chief comes back later, brother-in-law should still go to meet him and formally thank him for the appointment." At that time, the residence was very busy packing luggage. The Fifth Madam also had some private matters and invited Liang Xiaoyun to go in and help with the arrangements. An Yutian remained squatting in the small living room, waiting. After waiting for a long time, Mao Deshun came again and said, "The commander-in-chief has returned from the official residence after saying goodbye. He is about to get on the train. The living room is also full of people seeing him off. You should take this opportunity to go and meet him." An Yutian followed Little Mao, turning corners and arriving at a large living room. Sure enough, he saw that the inside was crowded with people, smoke was swirling, and they were all clustered around the short Governor Ye, who was standing in front of the large square table, vying to speak. On the table, there was also a set of ebony dominoes that had just been used for Pai Gow and had not yet been picked up. With great difficulty, Little Mao led the way, charging forward to squeeze to the front of the table and bow to Ye Zuozhang to express his gratitude. Ye Zuozhang glanced at him and loudly shouted, "Are you definitely going with me? Has a place been found on the train?" An Yutian suddenly thought that Liang Xiaoyun must be in the same compartment with the Fifth Madam on the train. It would not be convenient for him to be mixed in there. So, he blurted out, "I will definitely go with the governor." Ye Zuozhang did not wait for him to finish speaking. He pointed to another adjutant beside him and said, "Remember, prepare a room on the train for this Councilor An." The adjutant responded with a "Yes, sir." Ye Zuozhang immediately looked to his left and right and changed the subject. He had nothing else to say to An Yutian. An Yutian stood there blankly for a moment. Suddenly, he felt someone tugging at him from behind. He turned his head to look and saw that it was the adjutant who had just been designated by Old Ye to entertain him. He kept beckoning to him. He followed the adjutant out of the living room and listened to the adjutant say, "Come on, let me send you to the train first to find a place. When there are a lot of people later, I'm afraid you won't be able to find an empty berth." An Yutian did not want to refuse. The adjutant was also urging him. He wanted to find Little Mao to tell Liang Xiaoyun. Unfortunately, he didn't know when Little Mao had left. He had been careless for a moment. So, he followed the adjutant in confusion. He jumped onto an open-top car outside the gate. He also asked in the car what the adjutant's surname was and what his name was. But he forgot it as soon as he heard it.</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>According to yesterday's news from Beijing, the Executive Yuan will appoint Dai Jitao as the Imperial Commissioner to Mongolia and Tibet. It is said that it will be submitted to the Central Political Conference for approval within a few days. However, it is said that Dai has recently been overworking his brain, and his health is not very good. Assuming that he is appointed as the Imperial Commissioner to Mongolia and Tibet, he must personally go to Mongolia and Tibet. Whether Dai can travel long distances is originally a question.</p>
<p>The title of Imperial Commissioner existed long ago in the era of autocracy. In the Republican era, Yuan Shikai also borrowed it once. However, the meaning of the title Imperial Commissioner is originally to announce the virtues of the court and to comfort the lives of the people. I wonder what virtues Dai will announce this time and what methods he will use to comfort. This is a very important mission for Mr. Dai.</p>
<p>There is also a point of doubt. Mongolia and Tibet are thousands of miles away. Originally, all people who are part of the Republic of China should have the right to be comforted. If that is the case, then Jiangsu Province, which is near the capital, suffered from a major flood last year and a major war this year. The people are suffering and have no one to tell. But we have not heard that the government has any virtues to comfort the people. This is very regrettable.</p>
<p>Bringing joy to those nearby and attracting those from afar has always been the classic method of governing a country. Now the government only pays attention to the policy of attracting those from afar and has not thought about the policy of bringing joy to those nearby. Abandoning the near and planning for the far is probably a mistake made by the wise men of the government.</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Testing and Comparison Method of Brain-Boosting Substances <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Worker</p>
<p>Nowadays, people in the world are using their brains more and more, so our brains are also getting worse and worse. There is no lack of food or medicine to supplement it. But whether various foods have brain-boosting substances, or which of the various brain-boosting tonics sold on the market has more content, is not something ordinary people can identify. So now I will write down the testing and comparison methods for your reference.</p>
<p>Testing Method: First, dissolve the food to be tested in water, or decoct it into juice. Then, pour a few drops of ammonium molybdate or silver nitrate solution into it, and shake it a few times. If there is a precipitate, it proves that there are brain-boosting substances inside, because the main component of brain-boosting substances is phosphorus. It is often combined with oxygen to form phosphate (Po4) in things. But when phosphate encounters ammonium molybdate or silver nitrate, it combines to form colored precipitates. So, if after adding ammonium molybdate or silver nitrate solution, there is precipitation, it proves that there are brain-boosting substances inside.</p>
<p>Comparison Method: Put various brain-boosting tonics of the same volume in test tubes, and then add ammonium molybdate or silver nitrate solution to each. After adding, shake each tube, and then add more tonic, until each tube can no longer produce any more precipitate. Finally, look at which tube has more and denser precipitate. That tube has more brain-boosting substances, because in the same volume, more brain-boosting substances combine with ammonium molybdate or silver nitrate to produce precipitate.</p>

<p>— Ang Lian</p>
<p>"Old V-Get up! Get up!" People have already had a class, aren't you getting up yet?" O, holding a lecture note in his hand,</p>
<p>"Ugh... huh..." Old V turned over and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>"Fine! Sleep as long as you want, it's your own business" to be divided by the registrar, it has nothing to do with me," C said, hurrying off to class.</p>
<p>When C finished class and returned to the dormitory, Old V was just stretching in bed, a corner of the quilt falling to the floor.</p>
<p>"Lazy ox!" C blurted out, sitting at the desk to write a letter.</p>
<p>"Lazy ox? Don't you feel sorry for someone who hasn't slept all night..."</p>
<p>"Who told you to dance all night!" He lowered his head to write a letter again.</p>
<p>"That dancer is really too cute, she has me head over heels, my mind a wandering monkey," Old V said dramatically, "You know, I've already spent three hundred dollars on her, think, she, Marilyn, has such exquisite and charming art!"</p>
<p>"Charming? Hmph, dancers are never good, if you really fall in love, you'll suffer a lot."</p>
<p>"No way! My registered letter is coming soon!" Old V said, lazily getting out of bed. When he came back from washing his face in the water room, the room was crowded with five or six people.</p>
<p>"Hey! Old V, you have a registered letter, go to the mailroom to pick it up!"</p>
<p>"Good news!" Old V jumped up, "Money's here! I'm treating tonight, for sure!" He hurriedly put on his clothes.</p>
<p>"Of course you're treating!" The one nicknamed Dance Monster Old Zhang shouted loudly, "Call Marilyn to sit at the bar! Old V! Let us all get a taste!"</p>
<p>"Of course, of course!" Old V happily walked out the door with a dancing gait.</p>
<p>Dance Monster Old Zhang quietly watched what C was writing, "Love letter! Love letter! Old C is writing a love letter!"</p>
<p>"Public! Public!" Four or five people shouted in unison.</p>
<p>"No! No!" C blushed, pressing the letter down with both hands.</p>
<p>"It must be made public!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Bring it out for everyone to see!"</p>
<p>Just as they were arguing, Old V opened the door and came in, the color of his face not looking good.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Bad news! He threw the letter in his hand on the table.</p>
<p>They all crowded around to read the letter, only to see;</p>
<p>"You've only been in school for less than two months, and you've spent over five hundred dollars. Don't you think that in these post-war times, when all industries are declining, raising money is not easy? Such waste... upon seeing this letter, pack your bags and go home..."</p>
<p>"Bad news!" They stared blankly, the dejected Old A sighing.</p>

<p>— Ben Xi</p>
<p>Mr. W wrote to me, telling me that he has recently been engaged in a kind of humorous work, harmless but meaningful. He said that several of our comrades, in view of the national crisis, which is getting worse and worse, feel that a sharpened era has arrived, and love is by no means the urgent task of young people, so every day after class, they go to the park in an organized way to carry out work, specifically to destroy sweet talk.</p>
<p>These days, although the spring is about to pass, it is just reaching maturity. The love and nurture of the universe is scattering sweet breath. Young masters and young ladies are moved by the scenery and walk slowly among the flowers. Whatever national crisis, whatever pain, has gone with the spring breeze. The fire of youth is dancing everywhere, so in the depths of the green shade, there are now pairs of beautiful figures, all with the idea of "willing to be mandarin ducks rather than envying immortals."</p>
<p>Several comrades, each holding a book, broke into the lush branches in different directions, especially after hearing laughter coming from the cracks. When they got inside, they sat down next to the lovers, without saying a word, nor revealing a frivolous air, actually browsing through the scrolls. In this way, a pair of lovers who were sweet-talking would stand up and leave, although they felt embarrassed, they had no choice but to glare. This method has been tried and tested.</p>
<p>Ha! What a spoilsport, isn't this a bit of a sin?</p>

<p>— Su E</p>
<p>Yesterday, when I went home from school, I passed the entrance of the security regiment's garrison. At that time, there was a security guard in a yellow uniform standing at the door. He seemed to know that I would definitely pass in front of him, so when I was about to approach, he looked at me with a cheeky smile. At this time, I hated him extremely, and simply looked at him as well. Who knew that when I was looking at him, he put a hand over his mouth, and then waved it outwards. Ah! At that time, my nameless anger suddenly rose ten feet. I thought, you ghost, how dare you make such an ugly flying kiss at me? On one hand, I made up my mind, and pretended to smile on my face, all the way to their garrison inside. I found the commander, and I told him what happened, and asked him to severely punish that guy. Fortunately, the commander was very understanding, he quickly apologized to me, and agreed to my request, and a storm was finally over.</p>
<p>I think the security regiment is organized to protect the people, now not only does it not fulfill its duty of protection, but dares to tease women, it is really extremely hateful.</p>

<p>To Messrs. Nai Zhengzhi and Bin Jian, I have long wanted to engage in rubber industry investigation and manufacturing, but I lack the knowledge. The rubber factories in Shanghai have strict access and refuse visits, unlike my leather factory which can be open to the public. Now reading the attached publication, seeing the great works of the two gentlemen, discussing the rubber industry and manufacturing, I am overjoyed after reading it. May I ask for your address by letter? I will come forward to listen to everything. I think the two gentlemen are advanced people who advocate domestic goods, I trust you will not hesitate to teach me. Please accept my greetings. Mu Yunwu, in respect.
