<h3 id="c1">讀史汀生致波拉函（二） <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>歐戰結束。國際政治之重心巳移至太平洋上。而中國則又恰爲太平洋上風雲叢集之焦點。固早爲世界所一致公認。是故欲維護太平洋上之和平。并避免人類第二次之大屠殺。除尊生中國領土行政主權之完整如九國公約所簽定之明文外。蓋無他道。日出席九國會議之幣原代亦曾宣稱。「日政府之立塲。對於中國無人可以否認其自行統治之神聖權利。亦無人可以阻撓其造成偉大之國家命運。」今則盟誓在耳。口血猶新而竟一佔東北。再犯淞滬。舉凡盟約之尊嚴與國際信義。皆悍然不顧是則與其謂日迫害中國。毌寗謂爲迫害世界。與其謂日爲中國之敵或美國之敵。毌寗謂爲世界之公敵。華盛頓政府爲欲維護九國公約之尊嚴。曾放棄其戰艦製造之領袖地位並打銷甘姆菲列濱繼續設防之計劃。故九國公約復與海軍公約息息相關。破壞九國公約。即無異於破壞海軍公約。即無異於脅迫美國放。棄其現在之海軍政策。擴充其海軍以準備太平洋上之角逐。而此情勢。必又將立即引起倫敦之注意。重新掀起國際間海軍競爭之黑浪。與太平洋上不太平之怒潮。</p>
<p>勢之所趨。不得不爾故日人此次在我上海挑起戰禍。實爲世界第二次大戰之發端然則日本之罪惡。不更爲世界人士所灼見耶。自史汀生此函發表心後。在國際間顯然巳引起良好之反應。英泰晤士報孟却斯德報。都著論力表贊同法報稱爲美國遠東政策偉大之宣言北京。而講壇導報則更直指爲對芳澤脆弱靜議之痛快的反駁。視此國際之輿論色調巳漸趨顯明。使日軍終不覺悟。則華盛頓府對日。必將作進一步之有力表示遠東情勢重大之轉捩。爲期勢必不遠吾人於此蓋可預爲斷言。我國於國家際間一切盟約。向爲忠實之擁護者。於史氏斯函維護世界和平之熱忱。自表深重之敬意獨是吾人須認淸際此風雲幻變之秋世界各國莫不各有其立塲。而此立塲又莫不各視其本身利害而决定。換言之。即美有美之立塲。我有我之立塲。如依賴史氏斯函之所表示。而視爲拯我危困之靈符者不爲短視。即爲依賴成性。美對於制裁日人之暴行。縱有從行動上積極表示之决心。但至少亦必有一二年長時問之準備。之補充。與論之製造。其尤重要者大選舉實爲一大關鍵。故美即欲有所表示。亦决不在目前。在國際政局未有變動之前吾人猶處於孤軍奮鬥之難境。除竭盡全力。拼命苦鬥。以謀打破當前之難關而外决無他道亦决無其他倖存之理</p>

<h3 id="e1">Reading Stimsons' Letter to Borah (Part Two) <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The European War has ended. The center of international politics has already shifted to the Pacific Ocean. And China just happens to be the focus of the gathering storm in the Pacific. This has long been unanimously recognized by the world. Therefore, to maintain peace in the Pacific and avoid a second great massacre of humanity, there is no other way except to respect the territorial and administrative integrity of China as clearly stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty.幣原喜重郎, the Japanese representative at the Nine-Power Conference, once declared: "The Japanese government's position is that no one can deny China's sacred right to self-rule, nor can anyone hinder its creation of a great national destiny." Now, the oaths are still ringing in our ears, and the blood is barely dry, yet they occupy the Northeast and then invade Shanghai. They disregard the dignity of treaties and international faith. Therefore, rather than saying that Japan is persecuting China, it is better to say that it is persecuting the world. Rather than saying that Japan is the enemy of China or the enemy of America, it is better to say that it is the common enemy of the world. To uphold the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Washington government abandoned its leading position in battleship construction and scrapped the plan to continue fortifying Guam and the Philippines. Therefore, the Nine-Power Treaty is closely related to the Naval Treaty. Destroying the Nine-Power Treaty is tantamount to destroying the Naval Treaty, which is tantamount to coercing the United States to abandon its current naval policy and expand its navy in preparation for a contest in the Pacific. This situation will inevitably immediately attract the attention of London and rekindle the black wave of international naval competition and the turbulent tides of unrest in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The trend of events is inevitable. Therefore, the Japanese provoked war in Shanghai this time, which is actually the beginning of the Second World War. Then, isn't Japan's crime even more clearly seen by the world? Since the publication of Stimson's letter, it has clearly aroused a good reaction internationally. The British Times and the Manchester Guardian have both published articles strongly expressing their support. The French newspapers hailed it as a great declaration of American Far East policy. The Beijing Morning Post directly pointed out that it was a delightful rebuttal to the fragile 静议 (peaceful discussions) of 芳泽 (芳泽谦吉, Japanese Foreign Minister). It is evident that the international public opinion is gradually becoming clear. If the Japanese army does not wake up in the end, then Washington will definitely make further forceful representations to Japan. The turning point of the major Far East situation is bound to be not far away. We can foresee this. Our country has always been a faithful supporter of all international treaties. We express our deep respect for Mr. Stimson's enthusiasm for maintaining world peace. The only thing we must recognize is that in this autumn of rapidly changing situations, all countries in the world have their own positions, and these positions are all determined by their own interests. In other words, America has its own position, and we have our own position. Those who rely on what Mr. Stimson's letter expresses and regard it as a magical charm to save us from our predicament are either short-sighted or have a dependent nature. Even if the United States has the determination to actively express its sanctions on the Japanese atrocities through action, it will at least take a year or two to prepare and replenish, and the creation of public opinion. More importantly, the general election is a major key. Therefore, even if the United States wants to express something, it will definitely not be at present. Before the international political situation changes, we are still in a difficult situation of fighting alone. There is no other way but to do our best and fight desperately to break through the current difficulties, nor is there any other way to survive.</p>

<p>Since changing their strategy to attack our Jiangwan area with all their strength, because of our army's fierce resistance, every attack has ultimately failed. Therefore, they used dozens of cannons and dozens of aircraft to bomb Jiangwan Town day and night for more than thirty hours, hoping to destroy our army's positions, but the result was still a failure. However, the civilian houses in the town were burned to the ground as a result, and the whole town was almost a field of rubble. Many innocent residents who had not escaped from the town were bombed to death, and corpses were piled up like mountains, with a foul odor that was unbearable. Especially the nearby river water became more and more turbid. For safety reasons, our army temporarily left the town at 9:00 pm on the 26th and moved the front line to nearby defenses. However, the enemy army, seeing our side waiting in full battle array, was still spying on the area east of the town, too timid to move forward. On the evening of the 27th, the enemy army sent a small number of sentries to sneak into the town to scout under cover of darkness. When they were detected by our army, they immediately opened fire with machine guns and repelled them. Since then, both sides have been defending across the town. Therefore, Jiangwan Town is actually the focus of the fire lines of both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Our Army Defends Strictly Along the Sitang River <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Starting at 3:40 pm, the enemy again used a small number of troops to attack Yangjia Building south of Jiangwan. They were bravely repelled by our army. However, for strategic convenience, our army is now building defenses in an area slightly west of Jiangwan. The enemy thought that our army had retreated deceptively and did not dare to advance rashly. It was not until 7:00 am yesterday that the enemy used airplanes to first scout out the reality and then used giant cannons to bombard until nearly 10:00 am before advancing to 　　Bridge. At that time, our army had already completed preparations and launched a fierce counterattack. The enemy could not withstand it and retreated dozens of yards. When the enemy army reached the town, in order to prevent our ambush troops from hiding in the civilian houses, they set fire to all the houses, and the flames were more intense than when they were burned on Shishan Road in the past. At 4:30 pm, the Guowen News Agency reporter looked east from the Shanghai-Taicang Road and saw that the fire was still spreading. As for the enemy at Wancang Bridge, after being held back by our enemy, they built defenses in the vicinity. At 2:00 pm, they used a small number of troops to launch a sneak attack on Yanjiatai north of Jiangwan and Yangjia Building south of Jiangwan, but they all failed to succeed due to our solid defenses and retreated. After 3:00 pm, there were occasional gunshots, all fired by the sentries of both sides. The battle was not very fierce. At present, our army's defense line, starting from Jinmu House in the north and ending at Yangjia Building in the south, has formed a straight line, and the defense is more strict than before with Sitang and Yujing rivers as the battlefield.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Fierce Battle at Xiaochang Temple and Yanjiatai Yesterday <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>In the morning, the enemy in Jiangwan used cannons and more than ten aircraft to bombard the Xiaochang Temple and Yanjiatai areas. The artillery fire stopped at noon. Then, more than a thousand enemies attacked us from the Dashen House and Zhoujia House areas. Our army bravely charged and killed, cutting the enemy into two sections, causing them to be unable to respond to each other, and they retreated immediately. At about 1:00 pm, they were surrounded by our army. The mixed battle lasted for three hours. The enemy army was resolved by our army. As of 4:00 pm, there was artillery battle in that area again.</p>
<p>Also, at 8:20 am the day before yesterday, 囗囗团长 (regiment commander) Hua Zhaodong reported that the Japanese 19th Regiment of the Japanese 9th Division, about sixty to ten people, were reconnoitering our army's defenses near Mengjia House. He immediately sent troops to outflank them from the Shuidao Road and surrounded them. After a fierce battle of about an hour, the entire enemy army was wiped out without a single survivor, and three boxes of hand grenades and dozens of rifles were seized. At about 11:00 pm, there were very dense machine gun sounds in the Jiangwan area, which lasted for an hour before weakening. However, there was no cannon fire, which suggests that the area was not intense, only the conflict of the sentries.</p>

<p>Great Fire Burns for Two Days Unextinguished</p>
<p>Yesterday, Japanese troops in Zhabei still used three aircraft to drop bombs in the Zhabei area in the early morning. As a result, Qujiang Road and Gongxing Road became a scene of great fire again, which was not extinguished in the evening. From 4:00 pm, both sides resumed artillery battle until about 5:00 pm, when the enemy used a small number of soldiers to attack our Eight Character Bridge and Qingyun Bridge areas, but they were all repelled by our</p>

<p>army with machine guns. At the same time, our army's front line has advanced to the north of the Songhu Railway. The situation yesterday afternoon is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e9">Our Army Defeats the Enemy at Eight Character Bridge <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Japanese troops</p>
<p>continued to use cannons to bombard our Eight Character Bridge area fiercely at about 4:00 pm yesterday afternoon. About twenty minutes later, more than 300 enemy troops were seen coming to attack. Our army immediately opened fire. The enemy troops also fired their machine guns. Before long, the enemy troops came like a tide. Our army quickly swept with machine guns. The enemy troops retreated immediately, but the vanguard troops had already suffered six or seven casualties. Then, the enemy troops saw that our army's machine gun stopped firing, so they made a comeback again. Our army continued to attack fiercely, but the enemy troops were receiving support from the rear. Our army immediately went out of the trenches to fight. Both sides used hand grenades, rifles and machine guns to fire and fought fiercely for a long time. The enemy troops could not hold on. Our army pressed forward urgently. The enemy then collapsed and retreated. Our army rose up to pursue until they stopped and defended at Liujia Bridge.</p>

<p>When the Japanese troops</p>
<p>attacked Eight Character Bridge, the enemy troops in the Qingyun Road Qingyun Bridge area also had a large force, about six or seven hundred people, attack us at about 5:00 pm. After our army responded, they launched a fierce attack. As a result, the enemy troops were in a panic and were about to disperse when they were already surrounded by our army on the left and right. The enemy was afraid of being surrounded and retreated urgently. Our army took the opportunity to pursue and advance towards Tiantong'an Road. The enemy scattered and fled to the south of the Songhu Railway. In the evening, our army's front line had advanced to the north of the Songhu Road, relying on the danger to hold the line.</p>

<p>Zhabei Zhongxing</p>
<p>Road Zhongxing Lane was set on fire by enemy aircraft dropping incendiary bombs the day before yesterday. By the night before last, the road had been completely reduced to ashes. At the same time, the eastern end of Qujiang Road had been extended to. It only weakened slightly yesterday morning, but the embers were still burning. Yesterday afternoon, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in that area again, so the embers rekindled and the great fire broke out again. By about 5:00 pm, Dingyuan Lane had been completely burned, and the momentum was very strong, gradually extending westward. At the same time, Gongxing Road Guangyu Lane was also burning vigorously, and the houses on the left and right sides of Guangyu Lane had been burned to. The two great fires have been connected into one, lasting for two days and one night, and gradually saw flat extinguishing at about 8:00 pm last night.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Enemy Planes Bomb Zhabei <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Eight Killed, Eleven Injured</p>
<p>At the intersection of Haichang Road and Datong Road in Zhabei Yaojia Stone Bridge, yesterday morning at 11:40 am, four enemy planes flew to the area and dropped a bomb weighing about 150 pounds, which exploded immediately, destroying seven or eight questions (units) of houses with a deafening sound, forming a huge hole. Yaxiexing Hotel was bombed, killing the hotel owner and his wife, apprentices and four young children. Three passers-by were also killed. Nearby Dafengxiang Foreign Goods Store, Sugar Food Store and Paper Store were also affected. A total of eleven people were injured. At the same time, four people were pressed inside when the houses collapsed. After the incident, the security team and police workers dug them out. One person had been crushed too hard and died instantly. The other three were also seriously injured and were in danger of dying. They were immediately sent to the rear hospital by the Red Cross for treatment.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, three planes went to Dachang Liuhang area to reconnoiter. At 10:45 am, three bombs were dropped in Liuhang, killing one farmer and injuring two. In the afternoon, a bomb was dropped next to the Dachang Public Bus Station. The bomb probed into the soil, and the sand and dust flew up, accumulating on all sides like a small mountain, but there was no loss. It was immediately filled by engineers.</p>

<p>Enemy Warships Open Fire with Cannons from Time to Time to Disturb Our Fort</p>
<p>Chinese Iron Factory Hit by a Bullet and Set on Fire</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 am, the reporter boarded a small steamer along the Huangpu River to Wusong to inspect the war situation in that area. When passing the bottom of Yangshupu Road, he saw two enemy gray seaplanes No. 46 and No. 42 floating on the surface of the river. After this, he saw two enemy destroyers No. 15 and one No. 2 docked one after another. Until in front of Shanghai University, near the enemy airport of the school, there were about 40 enemy aircraft of gray and white color parked at both ends of the field, rising and falling from time to time, with dust flying. In the center, there were more than 20 camp tents, and the shadows of enemy soldiers were looming, seeming extremely busy. The small steamer passed the Jiansong Bridge and saw two enemy armored vehicles parked on Jungong Road near the water and electricity plant. At about 10:30 am, the wheel arrived at Zhanghuabang. From Shanghai University to Zhanghuabang, no traces of enemy ships were seen. There was an enemy yellow transport ship berthed at the Zhanghuabang Grain and Rice Wharf, and four or five hundred enemy soldiers and military supplies were being landed at the wharf. The Chinese Iron Factory in the Wenzaobang area was in flames, and it was impossible to approach it. The reporter then landed on the Sanjiaotou Port across the river from Zhanghuabang and asked the villagers there. According to them, four or five enemy ships attacked the fort the day before yesterday afternoon at about 5:00 pm, but soon stopped. From the night before yesterday to yesterday morning, there were no battles. The sound of guns and cannons from Houjia Wood Bridge and Jiajia Bridge was also silent. However, the large enemy fleet outside the mouth of Wusong was illuminating the sea with searchlights all night, and as many as twenty searchlights were a magnificent sight. Yesterday morning at about 6:00 am, two enemy ships sailed into the mouth of Wusong. The two ships were traveling very slowly. When passing the town of Wusong, they fired more than fifty cannons in succession to bombard our army in the town of Wusong. Our army also opened machine guns to counterattack the enemy ships. After the enemy ships passed the mouth of Wenzaobang, they sped away towards Shanghai. Yesterday morning at about 9:00 am, three enemy planes flew up from outside the mouth of the river and circled around our army's positions several times. They dropped several bombs in the Wenzaobang area. Three of the bombs hit the Chinese Iron Factory, which exploded and caught fire immediately, burning very fiercely. The reporter later had a little food and drink there. Until about 1:00 pm yesterday afternoon, six enemy ships sailed from outside the mouth of the river to San　Shui and opened fire, bombarding the fort. The soldiers guarding our fort also opened fire and returned fire at the enemy ships. The two sides bombarded each other for two hours. In total, several ships fired more than 120 cannons in succession, but the damage to our fort was very slight. Until about 3:00 pm, the tide ebbed and the enemy began to retreat outside the mouth of the river. The reporter also left Wusong and returned to Shanghai. The fire in the Chinese Iron Factory was still burning. When the small steamer returned to Qujiang Bridge at about 4:00 pm, it saw four trucks, fully loaded with military supplies, going from south to north along Jungong Road.</p>
<p>Many of the civilian houses in Wusong that were destroyed by Japanese warships were bombed. Several questions of houses in Zhao Jiasheng's house behind Yangwang Temple inside the east gate of Baoshan were destroyed the day before yesterday. Wang Ruizan's house in the east market of Yangxing, the厢房 (side room) and the main room, and several flat houses of Zhu Yingtang's family, a villager from Xiaozhujia House in the south, were all bombed and destroyed the day before yesterday afternoon. Fortunately, no one was injured in the above places. According to a villager who witnessed the incident, he has seen many Japanese bombs since the outbreak of the war in Wusong, but very few have exploded. He is used to seeing unexploded bombs falling in the fields and is not afraid at all.</p>

<p>Difficult to Unload Arms and Ammunition</p>
<p>Three Thousand Can Arrive This Morning</p>
<p>Part of Them Planned to be Transported to Liuhe</p>
<p>Japan has dispatched a large number of reinforcements to Shanghai to increase the front line and try to</p>
<p>attack again. More than 6,000 people have been transported to the front line in the past two days. It is said that there are still more than 8,000 people remaining on the various warships stationed outside the mouth of Wusong, including infantry and artillery. Due to the rising and falling tides, it is difficult to transport them by barge. The Japanese military headquarters has specially dispatched two large transport ships and merchant ships, and one 600-ton Yangtze River Japanese ship, and three destroyers, to undertake the barge transportation task. Yesterday morning, a warship and a river ship were first dispatched to load 2,000 Japanese soldiers into the port. At 4:05 pm, another No. 1 transport ship and 　鱼　 (Fish) ship were dispatched to Sanjiashui to barge the first batch of 2,000 people, which could arrive last night. The second batch of ships were sent, which can load 3,000 Japanese soldiers and should arrive in Shanghai this morning. All the cannons and machine guns are now being hoisted into the barge with cranes due to the difficulty of barging. Although all the shells and bombs are wrapped in purple grass, the transfer is even more dangerous. Once they fall, there is a danger of explosion. The Japanese army is afraid of destroying the transport ships and wants to unload and transport them to Shanghai, which takes more time.</p>
<p>It is found that the total number of Japanese soldiers transported to Wusong this time is 14,000. In addition, there is a part of engineer and baggage soldiers, residing in fourteen warships. In addition to most of them landing in Shanghai, it is heard that the Japanese side plans to transport a part of the army to Liuhe by boat to land. It is said that this time the battle will be changed again. In addition to the Jiangwan road as a frontal attack, troops will also be sent to disturb the Liuhe area, but our army is already prepared.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Continental News Exposes Japan's Financial Straits <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Thanks to Its Warlords' Disregard for Everything</p>
<p>Continental News said that Japan's invasion of the Northeast has been five months, and the military operations in Shanghai have also been one month. Its current economic and financial situation can be further studied to see how much it can support the war in China. However, to have a considerable understanding of Japan's financial strength, it is necessary to look back at the financial and economic situation since the 欧战 (European War). Most people have already recognized that the European War was harmful rather than a blessing to Japan. During the European War, Japan gained unprecedented prosperity. The government's annual income far exceeded its expenditure, and the national treasury had a surplus of no less than 640 million Japanese Yen. The Japanese government's credit at home and abroad was also like the sun in the middle of the day and the beginning of the full moon. After 1921, the prosperity of the war gradually began to show signs of decline. Then, the great earthquake in 1923 caused the government's finances to begin to decline like a river. There was no year without a huge deficit. By the beginning of the second half of 1931, the national treasury savings had been exhausted, and the public bonds raised since 1913 had increased to 2,417,697,000 Yuan, resulting in a total government debt of 4,378,593,000 Japanese Yen. Japan's public finances were so tight, and private economy was getting worse and worse. Since 1921, the average annual trade deficit has reached 380,000,000 Japanese Yen. Although there are various intangible income such as shipping income and foreign tourists' consumption in Japan, as well as overseas Chinese remittances and foreign investment income to offset the trade deficit, by the end of 1930, Japan had a total of 3,189,000,000 Japanese Yen to be paid abroad. In 1931, Japan's exports decreased even more, and since the Japanese warlords began to infringe on China's sovereign rights in Northeast China on September 18, the sharp decline has become increasingly obvious. It is found that the average annual export volume of Japan in the recent five years is about 200 million US dollars, and in 1931, it was only 114.7 million Yuan, a decrease of about 85 million Yuan. As of the recent five months, exports have been reduced to an average of no more than 75 million Japanese Yen per month, while in the first half of 1931, the average monthly value was 100 million Yuan. At the same time, shipping has been suspended, investment in China is no longer profitable, overseas Chinese cannot remit money back home, and tourist trade has also been greatly affected. All kinds of intangible income have seen a sharp decline. With such a decrease in its</p>
<p>exports, less than 100 million Japanese Yen per year, coupled with the unexpected shortage of intangible income, it is really incomprehensible. In this situation, how can it cope with the huge expense of 150 million Japanese Yen of national expenditure? This is why the Japanese government has not been able to balance its budget since 1929. Japan's public finances and private economy are as tight as mentioned above, and the current exchange rate of Japanese Yen can further prove the seriousness of the situation. Around 1922, still in the late stage of the war and prosperity, Japan had a total of 220 million Japanese Yen in deposits at home and abroad. After the Northeast incident last year, in less than three months, it had already abolished the gold standard. After May this year, its deposits have been reduced to 430 million Yen, only one-fifth of the deposit amount in 1922. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, every time Tokyo sent troops to Shanghai, the exchange rate of Japanese Yen fell by several pounds. In the first half of December last year, 100 Japanese Yen was still worth 49.5 US dollars. On January 28 this year, it fell to 37 US dollars. At present, it is only worth 30.5 US dollars. It is that the Japanese government has no way to prevent the devaluation of banknotes, and the Japanese banknotes are following in the footsteps of the Buma (hyperinflation in Weimar Germany). The facts are like this, undeniable. The Japanese people have obtained this kind of rapidly trending bankruptcy situation, 　虑 (should) thank their warlords for disregarding world public opinion and the people's burden capacity and still invading China, making the situation more profound. According to recent telegrams from Tokyo, the Japanese government expects to continue the Shanghai military operations until the end of March and has approved a military expenditure of 22 million Japanese Yen. The total military expenditure for the Shanghai operation has reached 56 million Japanese Yen. According to the latest news, Japan will continue to send a large army to Shanghai, then the war will be prolonged, the war zone will be expanded, and its military expenditure will inevitably increase further. If economists do a little research on the aforementioned totals, they cannot help but agree with the words of the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, Sato, to the reporter of the German newspaper "If the conflict between the three eastern provinces and Shanghai cannot be turned into a local event, Japan will lose everything."</p>

<p>Yesterday at 1-2 pm, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau escorted a Japanese spy, Hou Chuncheng, to Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower in Ximen and executed him by firing squad. A large crowd of onlookers gathered at one time. The following is a record of the announcement: For the matter of announcement, according to the report submitted by the first station of the second district, the member of the defense regiment captured an enemy agent, Hou Chuncheng, a 26-year-old man from Fuzhou, near the City God Temple, and found red and white armbands and other items when he was arrested. The case was sent to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. Hou Chuncheng's actions as a spy for the enemy army are in accordance with Article 12, Section 2, Article 10, Section 2 of the Army and Navy Law, and he is sentenced to death and handed over to this bureau for execution. Now, Hou Chuncheng is identified, bound to the execution ground and executed by firing squad to show a clear warning.</p>

<p>Received Thirty Yuan a Day from the Enemy to Set Fires</p>
<p>The areas of Zhongshan Road, Yongxing Road East Street, and Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei were previously set on fire by traitors. The Public Security Police successively arrested five traitors, including Wang Sanyuan, and transferred them to the military department for interrogation. At first, they tried to deny it in every possible way, but because the evidence was conclusive and there was no way to escape, they confessed that they had indeed received 30 yuan a day from the Japanese to set fires in Zhabei. Wang had received more than 200 yuan from the enemy until the day of his arrest. Wang's communication with the enemy was introduced by his cousin, who used to work as a foreman in a Japanese factory, etc. Therefore, the military department believed that during this war, they dared to set fires in broad daylight and disrupt public order. Yesterday morning, they were all bound to Zhongshan Road and executed by firing squad to show a clear warning. However, the fire on Zhongshan Road was still billowing with white smoke yesterday and had not been extinguished.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Shanghai Law College Completely Destroyed, Confirmed <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Report Submitted to the Ministry of Education for Instructions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Law College on Jiangwan Road, Zhabei, was painstakingly established over many years by Mr. Chu Fucheng and Mr. Shen Junru. In the autumn of the 19th year (of the Republic), classrooms and student dormitories were constructed. The classrooms could accommodate more than 1,800 students, and the dormitories could accommodate over 1,000 students. In the winter of that year, it was approved and registered by the Ministry of Education, achieving remarkable results. In the autumn of last year, a large auditorium was added. The total construction cost for all the buildings was over 400,000 yuan. During the January 28th Incident, the brutal Japanese army committed atrocities such as slaughtering our soldiers and civilians and burning our houses. In particular, they made a point of burning cultural institutions. Almost no building in the Zhabei area was spared. It was rumored at the beginning of this month that the college had been burned down, but because the college was located within the Japanese army’s important defensive line, it was impossible to go and investigate. According to reliable information, the college was indeed set on fire by Japanese soldiers on the 3rd of this month at 4 p.m. They entered through the side gate of the college and used gasoline, first burning the classrooms, then the auditorium and dormitories. The entire college was burned down by 5 p.m. the next day. It is reported that the college authorities, besides trying every means possible, have already submitted a detailed report of the incident to the Ministry of Education for instructions. The original report is as follows (excerpt): The tyrannical actions of the Japanese army are becoming increasingly rampant. Ignoring international conventions, on January 28th, they launched an attack on our [territory], committing murder, arson, and wanton destruction. They especially targeted our cultural institutions for devastation. The college’s Jiangwan Road campus, located near the Japanese military headquarters in the Hongkou [International] Settlement, was rumored to have been destroyed at the beginning of the war. Initially, due to the disruption of transportation, it was impossible to investigate. According to a new report from a school worker who escaped from the war zone, the auditorium, classrooms, and dormitories were indeed set on fire by the Japanese on February 3rd and 4th. The total loss of school property is estimated at over 435,000 silver dollars. Since its establishment six years ago, the college has not owned an inch of land or a tile, renting houses to enroll students and struggling to maintain itself. Later, the school directors initiated fundraising and purchased land in the 18th year [of the Republic], constructed classrooms and dormitories in the 19th year, and added a large auditorium in the 20th year, forming a basic structure. Unexpectedly, shortly after its completion, it was burned down by the enemy, which is deeply regrettable. It will not be easy to rebuild. Moreover, over 1,300 young students have lost their place of learning, and the need for nurturing the foundation of the country is even more pressing. Therefore, we must specifically report in detail the circumstances of the burning of all the college's property and investigate the property losses. A detailed list of the amount [of losses] has been prepared in duplicate for your ministry's inspection and approval. We also request that you forward it to the Executive Yuan, ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with Japan immediately and demand compensation, in order to maintain education and protect national rights. This would be a great act of virtue. (The following is omitted)</p>

<p>Telegrams Sent to the National Government and the League of Nations to Seek a Proper Solution Quickly</p>
<p>The National Salvation United Association of various groups held a grand meeting yesterday morning at 10 a.m. at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to commemorate the one-month anniversary of the anti-Japanese bloody battle in Shanghai. They mourned the anti-Japanese martyrs and invited representatives from the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army to report on the battle situation. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely solemn. After the presidium, consisting of Hu Shuhua, Chu Fucheng, and Feng Shaoshan, reported the purpose of the meeting, representatives from various armies and divisions reported on the battle situation. The representative of the 19th Route Army,</p>

<p>On the progress of the battle, saying, "The Japanese invaders have been poisoning Shanghai for a month. In this month, not to mention the armed soldiers sacrificing their lives on the front lines, the lives and property of our men, women, old, and young compatriots have been sacrificed under the guns, cannons, and bombs of the Japanese invaders' land, sea, and air forces. It is now impossible to calculate, and the crimes of the Japanese invaders are countless. On September 18th of last year, when we were suffering from severe floods and banditry, the Japanese invaders suddenly robbed our three northeastern provinces. On this day last month, the Japanese invaders again attacked the 19th Route Army, which was defending the Shanghai-Nanjing area, claiming that we were not resisting. Even if we resisted, it would only be for two or three hours. Unexpectedly, in this one month, the Japanese invaders' more than 40 warships, more than 140 aircraft, one division and one mixed brigade of the army, 5,000 naval landing troops, merchant plainclothes teams, tank vehicle teams, and field artillery regiments launched fierce attacks day and night without success. Therefore, we are issuing daily urgent appeals for reinforcements. Salt Lake [General Shiozawa] could not do it, so they replaced him with Nomura. Nomura could not do it, so they replaced him with Ueda. Ueda could not do it, so they said they would replace him with Hishikari. They said they would replace him with Shirakawa. The arrogant and brutal Japanese invaders, who look down on the world, are now panicking throughout the country. As for the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, although their weapons are not as powerful as those of the Japanese invaders, they have the determination to defend the country's territory. From the 20th, even if the enemy's artillery fire is even fiercer, we will only engage them with our flesh and blood." (At this point in Director Fan's report, he was extremely saddened and tears welled up in his eyes, and the audience sobbed.) "The soldiers' sacrifice is to fulfill their responsibilities to the country, for justice, and for humanity. In this month, relying on the blessings of our ancestors and the assistance of the people, we have slightly demonstrated the spirit of the nation. But we still have to desperately kill the enemy until we complete the responsibility of defending the country and the people." He concluded, "Please, gentlemen, unite and prepare for a long-term resistance to the enemy." The representative of the 5th Army, Zhang Zhizhong,</p>

<p>On the recent battle situation, the facts were the same as those reported in the newspapers these days (omitted). He also said that although shooting airplanes with rifles is not the proper method, our army has actually achieved results, which shows the loyalty and bravery of our army. Next, the Chief of Staff of the 80th Division, Yu,</p>
<h3 id="e25">Xiang Fangqiang, Gave a Speech ㈠ The Significance of Our Division's Participation in the Campaign Against the Japanese Invaders; ㈡ Duties and responsibilities from Yunzaobang to Jiangwan, and the experience of the bloody battle on the 22nd; ㈢ Please provide material and spiritual assistance from all sectors of society. After the reports, Director Fan, Instructor Wang, Staff Officer Xiang, and others took a group photo with the presidium in front of the stage to commemorate the occasion. <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>

<p>President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and Minister Zhu of the General Staff Department: The Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai, and the bloody battle has lasted for more than a month without gaining an inch. Those who fear Japan like a tiger and regard them as superhuman now know that is not the case. This one result alone has been very effective. The major powers' contempt for our nation's psychology has been swept away. The international anti-Japanese atmosphere, which could not be achieved with countless mental and financial resources, has also permeated the world. The tears in the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which were torn apart by the Japanese invaders, have already been addressed. (Great! In this month-long battle, the people of Shanghai exhausted their resources and dedicated their bodies to the battle, regardless of the consequences. Extended to civilian assets throughout the country, all are war costs. All people are soldiers. The Communist Party abandoned its usual views to assist in the anti-Japanese resistance, which is truly unprecedented. Our authorities, gentlemen, still have no hesitations. Zhang Xueliang's northeast territory, taken from his father's revenge, has been taken away. Currently, the enemy's elite troops are concentrated in Shanghai, with multiple preparations and divided forces. International oppression and domestic suppression of war. Warlords run rampant. There must be some consideration. Why is Zhang Xueliang, who holds heavy troops in his hands, still unwilling to advance, but intends to defeat them one by one? Or is he regarded as a father? At the commemoration of the bloody battle of the month, Shanghai people feel bloody souls pain and dedicated themselves to protecting great sacred war. Hurry up and do not come to a decision with the people. Give real strength to support the Shanghai War and immediately order Zhang Xueliang to send troops to show his effect on his ancestors, the entire Chinese nation.</p>

<p>Dr. Yan, Chinese representative to Geneva, to the representatives of all nations in the League of Nations: Since January 28th, Japan has unjustifiably attacked the defensive troops of Zhabei from the Shanghai International Settlement, continuously sending naval, land, and air forces to encircle and attack our unprepared Wusong fortress and the defensive positions of our troops. They have used fierce bombs to destroy defenseless cultural institutions and civilian residences and markets. A prosperous urban area of several dozen square miles has been reduced to scorched earth, and tens of thousands of our peaceful civilians have been killed. They have also arbitrarily used dumdum bullets to carry out massacres. All of Shanghai's industry and commerce have been suspended, and Chinese and foreign industrialists and merchants have been rendered unemployed, with millions of workers losing their jobs. Our front-line</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>soldiers, bearing the mission entrusted to them by the government and the people to defend every inch of land and fight for survival, have resisted the enemy with death and have followed each other. Our people have also spared no effort to contribute their materials and lives to act in unison with the defending army. Now, this life of bloodshed has lasted for one month and thirty-two days. Therefore, we have gathered 570 representatives from 167 public organizations to hold a memorial meeting for the month-long bloody battle to commemorate the atrocities committed by Japan against us under the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, to mourn the heroic souls of our fallen soldiers on the front lines, to seek the path we should follow, and to prepare to sacrifice ourselves to uphold world peace and various sacred covenants. Representatives of all nations in the League of Nations, who love peace and respect international faith, hope that the atrocities are enough to overflow the world. Quickly think about the most effective method to block the source of this flow. This will be the safety of the world and justice.</p>

<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>If Japan continues its atrocities, it must be stopped. The naval cooperation that Britain and the United States should implement within the next three to six months is what the world urgently needs today. If this cooperation cannot be realized due to a lack of understanding, then the responsibility for stopping Japan's atrocities should fall on the United States, which should reassert its leadership in the Navy. Japan's annexation of Manchuria and the exposure of its ambitions for Shanghai and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have shown its attempt to dominate the Pacific. This means that the Japanese military government is prepared to engage in a third foreign war, that is, a war against the United States. (The first was the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, and the second was the Russo-Japanese War of 1904.) This is not an alarmist statement, but who could have predicted that the seizure of Shenyang on the night of September 18th would be followed by five months of atrocities that would shock the world? From this point of view, the United States should use force to stop Japan's war against China, which is not only to maintain the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but also to preserve the United States' interests in China.

<p>Reuters, Nanjing, 28th: The Chinese Aviation Department issued a statement saying that the American aviator Mr. Short has been serving in the Chinese Air Force as an instructor for some time and has a close friendship with many Chinese aviators. Recently, seeing the Japanese army's atrocities and the bombing of Shanghai's undefended areas, which resulted in the deaths of many innocent women and children, he repeatedly expressed his determination to sacrifice his life to uphold justice and humanity. On February 22nd, Short flew out with a team of Chinese aircraft, but got lost on the way. He then saw three Japanese aircraft dropping bombs in Suzhou and immediately engaged them alone. However, three more Japanese pursuit aircraft attacked from a high altitude, forcing him to land. The Japanese aircraft continued their fierce attack, causing Short's aircraft to be damaged and Short to be killed. Short made the noblest sacrifice for the country he truly loved. The Chinese Air Force is deeply impressed by his work. The Chinese government has ordered that his remains be buried with the highest honors.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Asks the Shanghai South City Fire Brigade to Initiate [A Memorial]</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai South City Fire Brigade requesting that Hu Amao, who did not surrender to the enemy, be praised to comfort his loyal soul. The original letter read: "Dear Sirs, today's newspaper reported that Hu Amao, a driver for the South City Fire Brigade, was forced by Japanese soldiers to drive a truck loaded with military supplies. Hu, under duress, drove the truck straight into the Huangpu River, willingly sacrificing himself with the flood. The Japanese military supplies were all sunk. Such intelligence and adaptability, righteousness and willingness to sacrifice for the country, clarity of mind and unwavering in the face of difficulty, is a tragic and moving story that even scholar-officials would be ashamed of. It is appropriate to give special praise and seek to support his surviving family to comfort his loyal soul. If your organization agrees, please promote and initiate [this]. (Our association will also be listed as a co-sponsor.) To the Shanghai South City Fire Brigade."</p>

<p>To Be Implemented on March 1st</p>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, the Chinese and foreign officials of the Customs received a verbal instruction from the Commissioner of Customs, preparing to collect import and export duties in the Customs, dividing them into new and old taxes. The old taxes are for repaying indemnities to the foreign powers. The new taxes will be paid to the Central Government for distribution by the National Government. Because the foreign powers have already agreed to suspend the payment of indemnities for one year, there will be no distinction between new and old taxes in the future. All tax revenue will be paid to the Central Government. It is also said that this move will be officially announced today and is scheduled to be implemented on March 1st.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Condolence Message <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Purchasing Anti-Aircraft Guns Cannot Be Delayed. Recently, Japan has sent large groups of aircraft to Shanghai to participate in the war and has been disrupting our rear areas, such as the air battles in Suzhou and Hangzhou, only causing panic among our residents. Seeing the lack of aircraft in our country, and motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, people in various provinces have started fundraising to purchase additional aircraft and donate them to the army. However, due to the lack of qualified pilots, the costs are too high, and the results are limited. The value of anti-aircraft guns is cheaper than aircraft, and their function, at present, is no less than that of aircraft. Recently, some people in the radio industry have planned to initiate a change of direction for the money raised for purchasing aircraft to purchasing anti-aircraft guns. Not only can more anti-aircraft guns be purchased with the same amount of money, but their use is also much better than aircraft. They are currently contacting comrades to promote its implementation and working hard to publicize it, so that people across the country can transfer their funds for purchasing aircraft to purchasing such effective weapons, in order to carry out an effective and rapid anti-Japanese campaign.</p>

<p>Someone visited the 26th Wounded Soldiers Hospital at the intersection of Rue de la Lubeck and Avenue du General Foch and saw hundreds of our soldiers who were wounded while fighting the enemy. Although they were in great physical pain, they had joyful expressions on their faces and were not despondent at all. They all wanted to go out to kill the enemy as soon as they recovered. There were phonograph records in the hospital to help with entertainment. People from all walks of life often brought items to express their sympathy, but most of the food was bread, biscuits, etc., which was in oversupply. The wounded soldiers wanted to eat eggs. The reporter hoped that all circles would send more eggs for seasoning. For example, sending three dozen eggs would cost less than ten yuan, and each person could get one, which would be quite and easy</p>

<p>Li Fangxiao, an old man from Zhengzhou, Henan, is 110 years old. Liu Fusheng, a boy from Kaocheng, Henan, is only 10 years old. Both are Muslims. They each sent a package of oranges to the front-line soldiers of the 19th Route Army to express their condolences. The old man looks as strong as a young man and repeatedly expressed heroic words, as if he did not know he was old. It is rare to see such an old man and a young man comforting the troops. The Wan Guo Restaurant in East New Bridge donated half of the 510 yuan and 80 cents earned from the entire day's business on the 25th of this month to the front lines and entrusted the other half to the Red Cross Society.

<p>Due to the outbreak of war, many Wenzhou natives living in Shanghai fled from the war zones. Those with some financial means have mostly returned to their hometowns on their own. However, the poor compatriots who have stayed for a long time, both men and women, old and young, are suffering from hunger and cold, a truly pitiable sight. A few days ago, the Wenzhou Association considered providing them with travel expenses to seek a living elsewhere in Shanghai. Unfortunately, the Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping route has been affected by the war and is impassable, preventing the distressed people from returning home. Yesterday (the 28th), the Yili Steamer happened to be sailing to Wenzhou, and the association immediately requested the shipping company to provide free passage for over a hundred compatriots to return to their hometown.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Over Eighty Trade Associations Request Resumption of Business <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Working Together with Soldiers at the Front</p>
<p>To Implement the Original Aspiration of Long-Term Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>The following over eighty trade associations in Shanghai—money exchange, silk mills, silk and satin, cotton cloth, yarn, flour, cinder plants, color printing, rice, timber, mercerized cotton weaving, coal, tobacco exchange, wall paper, liquor shops, north-south goods exchange, south goods, pawnshops, cigarette factories, sausage, brick and tile, lime sales, ginseng and bird's nest, medicinal herbs, sugar, spun silk, iron, letterpress printing, and others—have submitted petitions to the municipal government and the municipal chamber of commerce requesting resumption of business. The petitions stated that since the Japanese troops started the conflict in Shanghai, some public opinion has held that businesses should not resume operations until the Japanese troops have withdrawn. In fact, although this view stems from patriotic zeal, it is ultimately unhelpful. The Japanese troops' invasion is intended to destroy China's commerce along the Yangtze River, to implement their so-called economic blockade. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed this view. The closure of Chinese industry and commerce is exactly what the Japanese want. If China fails to break their economic blockade plan and instead helps to achieve it, how can this be considered resistance? Moreover, driving out the Japanese invaders depends on military strength, military needs come from tax revenue, and tax revenue depends on commerce. If business is suspended for a long time, it will directly affect tax revenue and indirectly affect military pay. There have been proposals in public opinion to allocate a percentage of business profits to reward the troops, which cannot be done if businesses do not open. Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau issued a notice warning employers not to use the excuse of the war to dismiss employees. If they are restricted from dismissing employees but not allowed to open for business, how can they survive? The initial intention of the strike was simply to express hatred of the enemy and shared grief, not to threaten the violent Japanese by striking. The biggest reason why public opinion now advocates a long-term strike is that the nation is in distress and private interests should not be considered. However, as explained above, a long-term strike will only increase the nation's distress. During the European War, both sides staked their national fortunes to fight for the final victory. The idea that businesses should not open in enemy territory is not a plan the associations agreed upon. The associations believe that the resumption of business cannot be delayed any longer. The municipal government should be notified to quickly inform businesses throughout the city to resume operations. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council should be consulted to devise practical protection measures, so that businesses can fulfill their duties, work together with soldiers at the front, and implement the original aspiration of long-term resistance against Japan. This is truly the most urgent plan at the moment and cannot be further delayed.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese troops invaded, Shanghai's commerce has been in a state of stagnation. Therefore, the account settlement period for the 20th year was extended to the end of February by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Now, because the war has continued, businesses have not improved, and it is difficult to implement the account settlement period at the end of February. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has again petitioned the Municipal Government to extend the account settlement of the 20th year to the end of May. It is now learned that the Municipal Government has approved the Chamber's request yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of the "Shen Bao,"</p>
<p>We are writing in response to a report in your newspaper stating that a Pan Shunji Car Company on Gordon Road in Yihe Lane has transferred four or five trucks, originally owned by White Russians, to the Japanese enemy. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has strictly ordered us to investigate and reply. After a thorough investigation, our association has found that there is no Pan Shunji Car Company in that location. The only car company in Yihe Lane is Pan Baoji Car Company. Moreover, Pan Baoji is an executive committee member of our association and only owns two trucks. One truck was assigned by our association and is still working at the front lines for our army, as documented in our records. The other truck is hired by a Chinese factory, and there are receipts to prove this. Therefore, our association can guarantee that Pan Baoji has not provided trucks to the enemy. However, due to similar addresses and rumors, in addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to strongly guarantee this, we are hereby issuing the above statement to be published in the "Letter to the Editor" section of your esteemed newspaper to correct the record and avoid implicating the innocent. Respectfully, Shanghai Freight Automobile Association, February 28.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Important Domestic and Foreign Telegrams: British and French Envoys Reiterate <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Methods for Mediating the Shanghai War</p>
<p>Results of Discussion by the Foreign Affairs Committee</p>
<p>Believed the Methods Are Acceptable</p>
<p>But the Wording Still Needs to Be Revised</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British envoy Lampson arrived at Xiaguan at 9:45 AM on the 28th via Battleship No. 69. Accompanied by Acting Consul General Garand and four others, he went to the Huilong Hotel, and then to the British Consulate. Lampson telegraphed Foreign Minister Luo to meet him at the Foreign Affairs Official Residence. Luo inquired about the issue of a peace zone, and Luo replied that the matter required instructions from the central government. French envoy Wilden also arrived in Nanjing at noon today. Foreign Minister Luo invited both Lampson and Wilden to dinner this evening. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Based on the mediation methods for stopping the war proposed by the British envoy, Luo Wen-gan gave an impromptu report at the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting in the afternoon. After discussion, the committee concluded that the Shanghai War was entirely caused by the Japanese army, and the Chinese army was resisting in self-defense. If the nations could prevent the Japanese army from further advancing, China would adhere to the initial aim of peace to avoid expanding the situation. The proposed methods were considered acceptable, but with reservations regarding consideration and revision of the wording. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to information from the "Nichi-Nichi Shimbun," after news of Japanese reinforcements arriving in Shanghai and the appointment of General Shirakawa as commander-in-chief of the naval, ground, and air forces was received, the foreign envoys remaining in Shanghai believed that the future of Sino-Japanese relations would become increasingly thorny. On the evening of the 25th, they held an emergency meeting in Shanghai to discuss preliminary methods for mediating the Sino-Japanese war. The content was reportedly as follows: 1. The Sino-Japanese war should be stopped simultaneously on a fixed date. 2. After the ceasefire, the Chinese troops should withdraw ten li, and all major Japanese units should retreat to a safe zone, with a distance of twenty to twenty-five li between them. 3. When both sides withdraw, representatives from third countries should monitor the withdrawal, and third-country troops should guard the withdrawn positions. These troops will withdraw when Sino-Japanese negotiations begin. After this draft was finalized, the American, British, and French envoys have consulted with the highest Chinese and Japanese military and political authorities in Shanghai several times, and all believe that consultations are possible. Therefore, British envoy Lampson and French envoy Wilden separately boarded warships and set off for Nanjing to formally consult with our military and diplomatic authorities. Lampson arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 28th, went to the British Consulate to rest for a moment, and then telephoned Foreign Minister Luo to arrange a meeting at the Ministry. At 10:40 AM, he and Counselor England arrived at the Ministry. Luo greeted him with diplomatic etiquette. They consulted in the Minister's reception room for over an hour. The British envoy also stated that French envoy Wilden had arrived in Nanjing. At 12:00 PM, Foreign Minister Luo accompanied Chen Mingshu. Luo hosted a dinner for the British and French envoys at the Foreign Affairs Official Residence and invited officials from various departments in Nanjing. A reporter who visited a certain Counselor yesterday was told that at the League of Nations special assembly on January 3, most member states would be inclined toward peace and would compel China and Japan not to expand the war and absolutely avoid a world crisis caused by the Far East dispute. Most of Britain's trade with China is in the Yangtze River basin. Currently, serious attention is being paid to the Sino-Japanese affairs in the Yangtze River and Wusong River. If the current war cannot be resolved, the League of Nations Special Assembly will have a concrete and serious expression. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Highly Active Delegations from Various Countries</p>
<p>(Geneva) With the League of Nations Assembly special meeting about to open, the League of Nations Secretariat and delegations from various countries have been very active in recent days. In the League of Nations lounge, many expressed opinions on the outcome of this meeting, but opinions were divided and there was no consensus. However, according to some representatives, the League of Nations aims to restore peace, and the Assembly may decide to entrust this matter to the countries most concerned about the Far East. Others said that the only way for the Assembly is to implement the various clauses of the League of Nations Charter. However, there is also a major suggestion to convene a conference of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to handle this difficult problem, but this is unlikely to happen because it would be equivalent to giving up the Assembly's power under the League of Nations Charter. As for the opening procedures of the Assembly, the morning session will be devoted to electing the chairman. It is expected that Foreign Minister Hymans will be elected. In the afternoon, the Chinese and Japanese representatives will present the origins of the dispute. After the general debate, the Assembly will appoint a committee, and then the Assembly will decide on the form of the resolution. The meeting is expected to last for ten days. Many representatives are concerned whether the Disarmament Conference will be held at the same time as the Assembly meeting. It has not yet been decided. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Germany Restricts Foreign Coal Imports</p>
<p>(Berlin)</p>
<p>Due to the poor state of the German coal industry, the Coal Commissioner decided today to reduce the amount of foreign coal imported in March and April by 50,000 tons each month. According to the commissioner,</p>

<p>workers</p>
<p>has also been reduced from 261,000 to 200,000. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>U.S. President Approves Reserve Fund Bill</p>

<p>Date Set for German Presidential Election</p>
<p>(Berlin) The presidential election is scheduled to begin voting on March 13th. The order prohibiting public gatherings and speeches has been lifted, allowing all parties to engage in election campaigns. In the next two weeks, thousands of speakers will travel to all parts of the country to conduct campaigns, leaving no village, however small, unvisited. Among the presidential candidates, Hindenburg is the most prestigious. It is rumored that Hindenburg will issue a declaration on the eve of the election, explaining the reasons why he agreed to be a candidate and saying that those who vote for him are voting to support the current cabinet and its policies, and that he wholeheartedly supports the current cabinet and its policies. Among the candidates, Hindenburg has the best chance. Conservative Party leader Weistaura published a long list of prominent figures supporting Hindenburg tonight and said that the only way to restore Germany's vitality is to re-elect Hindenburg. The Social Democratic Party's "Vorwärts" also called on 8 million Social Democratic voters to vote for Hindenburg as a bulwark against the tide of National Socialism. It should be noted that when Hindenburg first ran for president seven years ago, the newspaper condemned him as a puppet of reactionary parties, but now it is supporting him so strongly. This shows that the battle lines of German party strife have now undergone great changes. The other candidates are: one is the Communist Party's Thälmann, one is the German National People's Party's Dusterberg, and one is the National Socialist Party's Hitler, who has now begun his campaign.

<p>Swiss Parliament Passes New Tariff</p>
<p>(Bern) The Swiss Federal Parliament today passed a new tariff, which greatly increases the tax on all goods that can be manufactured in Switzerland but are imported from foreign countries, and some items can hardly be imported again. This new tariff is scheduled to take effect on March 1st. It is expected that trade between Switzerland and its neighboring countries, such as Germany, France, and Austria, will greatly weaken in the future. (27th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ludendorff Discusses the Sino-Japanese Incident</p>
<p>Munich, Rumors that German World War I General Erich Ludendorff was invited to China to serve as the commander of the Chinese army to deal with Japan. Today, Ludendorff stated that of course, I cannot go to China. I am quite worried about the Sino-Japanese dispute, because I fear that it will become the start of a world war. Such a tragedy must be avoided with all our efforts. Wall Street in the United States, the place where New York's major banks are concentrated, is well aware of this situation and has recently developed plans to expand loans and make serious preparations. Wall Street wants to take the opportunity to expand the Chinese market, but this is not allowed by Japan. Japan must advance, and it must be known that the three northeastern provinces are extremely important to Japan's life. (27th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Important News [P Chiang Kai-shek and Jiang Bocheng Go to Beiping]</p>
<p>To Visit Zhang and Discuss the Northeast Problem</p>
<p>Had a Secret Talk with Han in Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence: Chiang Kai-shek's representative, Jiang Bocheng, recently went to Beiping from Nanjing to discuss the Northeast problem with Zhang Xueliang. Han Fuqu received a telegram from Jiang Bocheng in advance, inviting him to Jinan and asking to meet at the station to discuss matters. Therefore, Han arrived at the station at 6:10 p.m. today (24th). When the train Jiang was on arrived, he boarded the train and talked with Jiang for about 20 minutes before finishing. Jiang then spoke to the visitors, briefly stating that this trip was ordered to go to Beiping to discuss matters with Commander Zhang. Regarding the recovery of the Northeast, because the matter is too important, no rules have been set yet, and it is still being planned. Zhang Deputy Commander's Chief of Staff, Bao Wenjun, arrived in Nanjing yesterday and met General Chiang. He also met Bao. Bao reported to General Chiang</p>
<p>on the current situation in the Northeast</p>
<p>and planned everything. Therefore, General Chiang</p>
<p>dispatched this official</p>
<p>to discuss matters with Deputy Commander Zhang. Because the General</p>
<p>had something to say,</p>
<p>he also asked this official to Jinan to conveniently pass it on.</p>
<p>Regarding the war, the Japanese 5th Division is the strongest in the Japanese army.</p>
<p>This division has fought in Northwest Siberia and brought</p>
<p>politicians to attack Jinan in the 17th year of the Republic. The soldiers in Shanghai are not enough for our army.</p>
<p>There are other</p>
<p>matters that have been going on for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>They are not worth mentioning. Jiang also said that if it were not for our army in Shanghai</p>
<p>, the</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan incident would have already happened.</p>
<p>At this point,</p>
<p>Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie</p>
<p>and Government Secretary-General Zhang</p>
<p>Dengtang boarded the train</p>
<p>and still did not leave</p>
<p>the train, leaving Jinan for Beiping at 6:40 p.m. (24th)</p>

<p>Organize Local Self-Defense Committee</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Discovered at Zhuang Station</p>
<p>Songjiang correspondence: This county is close to Shanghai. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, local security has been maintained very thoroughly by the military and police. The county government recently convened leaders of various groups and heads of various bureaus and offices to discuss defense issues. It was decided to organize a local self-defense committee, referring to the methods of Zhenjiang and Danyang, and draft a general outline of the organization, appointing nine people, including the county magistrate, as permanent committee members. It will set up information, propaganda, security, fire prevention, relief, transportation, and communication sections, which will be managed by committee members. It plans to organize a self-defense force of 100 people in the city and suburbs to strengthen security.</p>
<p>Bai Jizhi, director of the Joint Military and Police Inspection Office, recently issued a notice with County Magistrate Shen, stating that the war is currently fierce and this county is close to Shanghai. In order to consolidate the rear and maintain security, starting from the date of the notice (25th), pedestrians will be prohibited from traveling after 11:00 p.m. and food and lodging shops should close before the appointed time.</p>
<p>On the 25th, the last train from Shanghai to Hangzhou passed through Xinlonghua Station. Suddenly, enemy aircraft were discovered in the sky, flying along the railway line, watching for an opportunity to drop bombs on the locomotive. The passengers were greatly alarmed and got off the train to hide in the bamboo forests and fields, hoping to avoid danger. As expected, two enemy bombs were dropped, but fortunately, they did not hit the target. One fell into the mud and did not explode, and the other fell on a pile of firewood and coffins, causing coffins to fly around. Later, the enemy aircraft returned to Shanghai, and the train escaped danger and continued to drive. However, the passengers were all frightened. Yesterday morning (26th) at around 6:00 a.m., another twelve enemy aircraft flew west along the Huangpu River. When passing through Songjiang, they flew very high. According to news from Hangzhou, Qiaosi Airport was bombed by enemy aircraft, so the enemy aircraft passing over Songjiang must have been going to Hangzhou.</p>
