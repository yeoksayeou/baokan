<p>自一二八滬變發生至於今天。恰爲四週月。在今日吾人立於隨風翻飛之半旗下。以十二分之摯忱。對滬戰戰殉國之忠烈將士。表示最崇高之敬意與哀思。誠覺萬感叢集悽愴末能自制。</p>
<p>廻思去年東北禍變突發。在不抵抗之亂命下。半壁山河。轉瞬淪亡。至今三千萬同胞。猶陷於水火。末由振拔。當滬　爆發之先。日軍人亦作豪語。謂四小時内即可佔領上海。其目中蓋早已視我國如無人。不有我忠烈之將士。奮其英武。崛起抗禦。鏖戰肉搏。則上海三百萬人民。或亦早陷於與東北同胞。同一命運。國未亡而身先淪爲奴隸。即上海之局面。今日正亦不知何若。此則諸忠烈將士之豐功偉績。長鐫於吾人之心版。永永不可磨滅者一也。</p>
<p>邇近數十年來。外人對於我國之批評。善意者目爲獅。惡意者則目爲怯弱無能之民族。爲應受淘汰之弱者滬變爆發之先。亦大都斷定我國决不應戰。而默認日人四小時内佔領上海之語。爲非誇大之言。其目中亦早視我國如無人。不有我忠烈將士之艱苦决鬥。屢挫强鄰。使日三易主將。其將何以換新國際人士之耳目。轉變國際人士之觀感此一月又二日光榮之戰績。實足昭示世界以睡獅今已覺醒。我民族尚未喪失其立國之精神此則諸忠烈將士之豐功偉績長鐫於吾人心版。永永不可磨滅者二也。</p>
<p>民國以來。無歲不戰。爭城以戰。殺人盈城。爭地以戰。殺人盈野。將士之死於鋒鏑者。同胞之無辜被難者。何可勝紀。損失之鉅。荼毒之慘。誠令人不忍廻思。然而此二十餘年來諸戰役。除北伐爲有意義之戰爭。參加北伐之死難將士。爲有價值之犧牲外。餘皆爲爲虎作倀。爲個人作工具。助軍閥作鷹犬。其死蓋塵埃之不若。此次淞滬之戰。則爲維護正義。爭取我民族生存自由之光榮戰爭。滬戰殉國將士之死。亦爲光榮之死。偉大之死。以此一戰而一部分軍人。乃亦從而憬然覺悟。表示再不參加内戰。以此一戰。而多數憂國之士。乃亦怵於内戰之决不容再有。從而發起廢止内戰之運動。故此戰有若一聲洪鐘敲破我民族二十年來酣於内戰之心理。其影響我民族之前途。至鉅至深此則諸忠烈將士之豐功偉績長鐫於吾人心版。永永不可磨滅者三也。</p>
<p>嗟乎。斜陽荒草。戰壘永在。碧血斑爛。長與日月爭光輝。殉國諸將士。雖死不死矣。吾人認爲今日追悼殉國諸將士。不應徒在於下半旗獻花圈讀祭文默念致哀諸種形式之追悼。而應在於諸忠烈將士衛國守土禦侮抗日英武精神之承繼。抑吾人尚有欲建議者。諸殉國將士。爲國家爲民族已作忠烈之犧牲矣。然而諸將士之老父老母孤兒寡婦。失所依附。情至足悲。不久以前。曾有人倡議敎養遺族。但今已寂然無聞。吾人認爲爲紀念先烈。爲崇德報功爲鼓勵後來。此舉實有必要。深盼國人集羣力以共促其成。</p>

<p>對東省採積極侵略政策特議會定下月一日召集英俄報評新閣之一斑</p>
<p>華聯社二十七日東京電日内閣今日下午舉行第二次閣議、議定於六十二届國會首相之施政演說内容、聞其綱領爲（一）對滿蒙採取積極政策、（二）安定國内人心、（三）實行社會政策、除去社會上之不安、（四）救濟農村之困苦、（五）肅正軍紀、維持國軍之信用、（六）肅清政界之腐敗行爲、（七）刷新建造財界、上列七項已交付柴田書記官長着手起草、</p>
<p>路透社二十七日東京電今日聞特别議會定六月一日召集、歷時約兩星期、開會日、政府將發表外交財政及一切庶政政策、議會主要目的、爲通過豫算案及其他財政計畫、據政界消息、外交政策似將較前内閣略爲寛大、財政政策雖稍擴張、但無大變更、</p>
<p>遠東社二十七日東京電齋藤組閣後、對於台灣總督一職、本擬請政友會派之兒玉秀雄擔任、今忽任民政黨派之中川健藏爲台灣總督、因此政友會對新内閣用人極爲非難、因永井拓相係民政黨員、而又任該黨中人中川爲台灣總督、殊失此次組織超然内閣之精神、由是政友會與民政黨兩派對於六月初旬必須更換之國内地方官吏、引起非常注意黨派配置</p>
<p>電通社二十七日東京電留任之荒木陸相、關於今後方針語人曰、目下急務、第一爲軍之統制、其大體方針早已决定、以後着着實行而已、滿蒙及其他方面之問題、亦照既定方針邁進、</p>

<p>路透二十七日倫敦電泰晤士報今日社論、批評日本新政府、謂齋藤之爲新政府領袖、可見日本或將恢復一九一八年以前施行有效之方法、即首相與國會政黨無眞正關係是、以期療治國家政治痼疾、國人不喜激烈思想、故對於軍人之干涉政治、加以忍耐、雖上海冒險事業、現被認爲過失、但全國迄未稍减其日本對於東三省應有最後判决權之决心、可見此次政潮乃内部關係云、泰晤士報又稱、日本不寗靖之根本原因、起於經濟狀况、新政府在一般經濟未恢復時、僅能採行柔和方法、然此或未能使責難政府者帖服也新相與其閣員、前途尚有鉅大困難、首相雖以温和著聞、然恐未能有補於其對軍閥之關係、故首相不得不希望日内瓦或華盛頓勿作激怒日本極端國民主義者之言行、因若輩現猶在狂躁危險之狀態中也云、</p>

<p>在羊肚溪失事</p>
<p>廿分鐘内全沉</p>
<p>員客全部溺死</p>
<p>本埠美商捷江公司彝陵輪、由重慶來滬、行至萬縣宜昌間、突遭觸礁、船身於二十分鐘即行沉没、旅客船員、死亡甚衆、記者特往調查、兹分記其大概狀况如下、</p>
<p>失事情形彝陵輪由重慶裝運貨物並旅客四十餘人、開航來滬、該輪在二十三日離渝、至二十五日午刻、行至宜昌下流及萬縣上流江面、地名羊肚溪、該處礁石甚多、上下輪船、本視爲最難行之處、日來長江上游水勢忽漲忽落、該處江面暗礁、水當淺時顯露、輪行可以趨避、今因水漲之故、礁石爲水漲淹、輪船經過、不能目覩、該輪正值下航、江水激流、而衝入暗礁石上、船體爲暗礁觸破、頓時進水下沈、</p>
<p>沉没迅速彝陵輪肇禍、據稱、係船由激流下水、外舷撞入礁石、因碰擊過重、立時破碎、江水狂冲進輪、一瞬之間、船身便爾下沉江内、前後祇二十分鐘、即全没江底、祇露出桅木一段、該輪此次失事、據公司中人言、（一）由江水漲落不定、（二）大都領港員錯引水道、致衝擊在礁石之上、而釀成此奇禍云、</p>
<p>被難人員查該輪中共乘有旅客四十五人、又有船員水手生火等十餘人、當時觸礁之際、全輪震動、在艙内各旅客、正欲出艙逃生、即在艙面船員水手、欲思解取舢舨及救命衣、而因下沉過速、不及逃避、全部員客、竟無一逃出、完全隨輪溺入江中、而成此空前慘劇、</p>
<p>船主脫險昨日晨、捷江公司、接得在羊肚溪之美國兵艦、發來無線電報告、彝陵失事經過、謂船主海納遜氏、已經救出、業由上駛入川之渝江輪載往重慶、其他落水之旅客船員等等、大多數已經爲激流冲去、或死在船内、而得以入水後逃起者、大約不過二三人、詳細情形、尚未報告到滬、昨日滬行已發電至重慶詢問、並令打撈及救援落水之旅客、</p>
<p>輪船損失捷江公司之上江輪中、以彝陵輪最佳、該輪載重爲三百噸、船身係鐵壳、引擎甚美、計自行駛川河十餘年來、從未擱淺或失事者、爲上江輪内最完美之一船、今次自重慶下航、船内裝載貨物無多、今連郵件、全部沉失、損失之數、至少十餘萬元也、</p>

<p>「張先生！你請在我房廟寛坐一下。等我敲了鐘再來陪你談。」</p>
<p>說了，我便去敲我的曉鐘。我一面走一面想，這個鬍子倒是給了我一個難題目。我必得拒絶他。但是他在鄕下是有一部分的勢力，他成事不足，敗事有餘，我必得留神。我雖必須拒絶他却决不可以得罪他。不是冤家不碰頭。敲鐘把他敲醒抽大烟已經是使我夠受了。現在我提倡辦學堂，他又要來做先生，天下有這樣巧事，眞是令人可笑可惱。可是怎麽辦呢？……我敲了鐘，走進房，只見張鬍子是躺在我的床上打呼了。這大概是曉鐘的效力吧？他聽見我的曉鐘是必須睡倒嗎？誰知道？好，率性讓他睡吧，睡到我有辦法的時候再呌醒他。</p>
<p>有了！這個學堂應該歸全村的人民主持。誰能獨斷獨行？誰能私相授受？好，就這麽辦。每家派一個代表到廟廟來共同商議。我想而又想覺得這是最公平的辦法，除此以外，再也想不出更的的。我於是走遍村莊，挨家招呼說：「每家請派代表一人，公議開學請先生，聽我鐘聲一響就來。」……小孩們是歡天喜地的說：「要開學堂了……我們有學堂進了……」</p>
<p>我一一招呼完畢，即回到廟廟來佈置一切。這些人來開會、會是如何開法呀？這村莊裏自從盤古開天關地以來，是没有開過一次正式的會。我也没有這種經騐。這個創校會議是多麽的重要，我們能夠隨便的開嗎？不錯，我抽　裏有一本什麽會議通則，何不拿出來看看。這本書是一位青年遊客送我的。現在這部書便成了我們惟一的指導。我以爲翻幾翻，曉得一個大概，便可以動手敲鐘。其實没有如此容易。我這次做事，未免過於匆忙，好像臨渴掘并一般。但是我以爲臨渴掘并還是憑着自己的努力去謀解决，總比站在那兒等天下雨好些。我一連看了兩個多鐘頭纔把開會的重要秘訣弄清楚。我於是大膽的去敲那召集創校會議的鐘。</p>

<p>雲既述麵店老人事。又爲余言冉振及何啞虎之殺敵。虎虎有生氣。今先記冉振。當日軍侵我遼吉之後。執政者既以不抵抗主義高揭。還我河山。渺無日期。然而東省民衆受盡日軍之荼毒。廬舍爲墟。白骨盈野。大都已爲無國無家之人。故義勇軍崛起於各地。與日軍作野戰。洒血擲頭。屢摧强敵。迄今聲勢頗大。日軍雖欲撲減之而未能也。冉振者。牛莊人。趕驢爲生。曾人行伍。能荷槍作戰。後以得罪長官而遁去。在里巷中好行俠義。齊民中頗有名焉。巨匪老北風恨日人之强暴。揭竿而起。率其徒黨。夜襲牛莊。守備之日軍倉猝應戰。義勇軍奮力殺賊。日軍大敗。冉振則於夜間披衣起。握木棍。疾趨日軍營。伏於暗陬。適逢一日兵退走。一躍而前。棍下而日軍踣地矣。乃奪其槍及子彈。加入義勇軍作戰。擊斃日軍多人。且導引義軍痛追喔是役也。大使日軍喪膽。老北風佩其勇。頗賞識之。其後日軍增援反攻。義軍以戰略關係。遂不得已退走。冉振亦同去。不識此忠勇抗日之壯士。今尚在軍中否也。</p>

<p>滬一月餘之抗日血戰。大刀隊參加殺敵。忠勇莫倫。有口皆碑。兹述大刀隊之類别。爲本刋補白。</p>
<p>專用大刀之大刀隊。無其他武器。作戰時居步騎兵之後。迨短兵相接。種鋒肉搏時。一聲喊殺。躍出前敵。大刀砍處所向披靡。倭人每見刀光。不覺其膝之屈。或足之向後轉。此輩或擇兵士訓練而成。或民衆之激於義憤而來此者。蓋皆熱血男兒也。</p>
<p>兼用大刀之大刀隊。實即軍中之步兵也。彼輩手提長槍。背負大刀。作戰時。遠以槍擊。近則荷槍而用刀。蓋槍端剌刀。不若大刀劈殺之快利也。劉峙之第一師。前月進駐吾常。吾見其軍中步兵。背際各揷大刀一柄也。</p>
<p>全身武器之大刀隊。大刀之外。腰懸盒子砲。及手溜彈。兩腿綁布中均藏匕首。作戰時。宜用槍者。則盒了砲發如聯珠。宜用彈者。則手溜彈遥擲必中。苟敵方彈來如雨。無可避讓。則揮舞大刀。寒光閃爍。不見其人。但聞彈爲刀格。錚錚作響。不能及其身也。國術中之善使刀劍者。衣白衣。舞至酣暢時。但覺刀光劍影。寒氣逼人。潑以濃墨。盡爲刀障。迨其舞罷。白衣無半點汚痕也。大刀隊殆亦具此神技歟。與敵人血搏。每以大刀砍劈。當者立斃。若寳刀不幸而折。則棄之而出匕首。短刀狂舞。亦所向辟易。此全身武器之大刀隊。遠射近攻。無往不利焉。</p>

<p>故都雜冩之六</p>
<p>廟會，差不多是古代市廛制度的遺留。</p>
<p>每逢月中一定的日子，阜内大街上便洶湧着黑壓壓的人潮，路旁也頻添了許多小販的攤兒，並且你還以聽到要把戲的鑼鼓的喧鬧，賣技人的胡笳獨奏，烟鬼清戰，以及許多許多呌賣的聲音。如此如此地延續了三天，這是誰都知道白塔寺裏有着廟會了。</p>
<p>廟會，在北京本不止白塔寺一個，我所知道的城裏還有一個護國寺，城外温泉那邊也有一個，可是我因庽所離得白塔寺近，所以白塔寺廟會的情形曉得熟悉一點，其實呢。所謂廟會也都差不多的。</p>
<p>廟會的日子來到，附近的人們都興高采烈地趕着逛，就是遠道雇洋車來逛也頗不乏，尤其是近處的小孩們，到廟會的日子全都笑開嘴兒狂一般的鑽進廟會去，因爲他們在那時可以看西洋鏡裏的大姑娘洗澡，看到山東人要的猴兒戲，還有三個大子兒一聽的臨時梆子兒，以及一個大子一杯的荷蘭水，總之，他們認爲廟會裏的一切都能勾引他們小小的心靈，使他們樂不思蜀呢。廟會廟，除了看的，差不多日常用品都有得賣，和小兒子做短衫的料子也有，女學生寫情書兒的花花信紙也有，裝飾女人的珠寳兒也有，可是價錢都比外面大街上來得便宜，進雖然是喜歡買高價洋貨的貴婦人小姐們的芳踪所不到的原因，可是中産階級以下的人們却是趨之若鶩的。自然囉，這裏有最合他們的胃口的市價，同時廟會也差不多是爲了這中産階級以下的人們而保留下來的。</p>
<p>我在廟會裏化了十個大子買了盆百日紅，自已委高興地捧回庽所裏，因爲要使他一天繁榮一天，所以每天總和服侍老爺一樣的服侍他，和他捉蟲，並且澆了很多的水，可是不上一星期，花就　了，葉兒也枯了。於是我又期待着次一個廟會，好再買一益。</p>

<p>安玉田愛了這番敎示。如頑石點頭般唯唯諾諾。再無話說。暗中却正在横了心的拚了出去。横竪梁笑雲是爲了眞心愛他才作如此打算。非如此不能順遂伊的心意。及換取將來的共同的幸福。就是良心上終不免感覺得是意志薄弱。不像個正人君子。但正人君子到飄流窮困時無人憐念。也一樣的受不了。倒不如渾天糊塗。沉醉在極難得的温柔鄕裏。把那些書毒頭的迂念忘掉。只等候名利場中喜音的來到罷。過了一天。果盼到毛德順押了汽車前來迎接。一進門就蹦蹦跳跳。對他們夫婦行軍禮。呌大人太太。巴結得好不道地。後又慌慌忙忙的說到正經事上。丑表功似的嚷道。我留了一整天的心。全哨探好了。大帥這兩天就要出京。忙得不可開交。公館裏早晚來的客人。越發赶這個緊急的當兒。比平常日子更多。若安夫人跟他們一道兒去擠。恐怕談不上什麽話。如今另有個好法子。大帥今晚定要上大舞台聽各大名角一齊會串的大義務戲。樓上包廂足包好十來個。五太太本就想接安太太去一同聽戲的。不如就便也請安大人同去一趟。只消上戲園子去得早。等台上尚没唱着好戲。大帥坐在那裏有些發悶的時節。就由我說是奉五太太之命。領了安大人去見見他。乘他那個時候高興。包可以談得很對勁。此刻天已快黑了。請你二位就快些預備。先到公館裏去見五太太。回頭再一塊兒上大舞台去候着。大帥晚上雖也有許多撥飯局。但爲了要聽好戲。一定抽空兒到得早的。快…快。汽車已在門口候着。五太太特呌我來催請呢。梁笑雲聽了不勝歡喜。請那毛德順隨便休息一會。伊就回臥房裏去梳洗裝扮。並囑安玉田也須更換新製的漂亮袍褂。安玉田暗想着這幾天眞聽着了多少新鮮門道。見當今大闊人也另有特别意想不到的見法。須到笙歌雜奏金鼓交鳴的戲園包廂裏去見。才能碰到大闊人高興的節骨眼兒上。這眞是奥妙難知高深莫測了。</p>

<p>甚麽呌做爲人的道理？爲人的道理，範圍甚廣，總而言之，爲人之道，不可以勢凌人，恃强欺弱，須要行人方便，自己方便，</p>
<p>古人有兩句話，毋爲親愛者所痛，爲見讐者所快，就是他自己大難臨頭，或是蓋棺論定之際，他的人格就在此兩種人類裏可以判定了，</p>
<p>例如一個乞兒，或是一個絶對貧乏的人，到了没奈何的時候，總有人來憐惜他或是接濟他，若是一個土棍流氓，或是一個有特殊權威的有槍階級，這種人雖然死了，傍人非但不加憐惜，還是要稱快的呢，</p>
<p>故爲人的道理，原無絶對的標準，不過這人在世界上，於人有利的，即爲好人，於人有害的，即爲惡人，</p>

<p>— 銚</p>
<p>近代的許多新發明，總没有像無線電那樣的驚人，牠把電的力量在空中傳到數千里之外，「順風耳朶」這一句話，已經能夠實現了，現在我要把牠的原理來與讀者講講，</p>
<p>電不但能夠在金屬上流動，並且再能發出一種波浪來在空中行動，這種電浪流行的速率與平常的光差不多快，大約每秒鐘行三萬萬米突，電浪有長短不同的分别，靠着發出電浪的蓄電池而定的，有一種電浪，牠每一個波浪是四百米突長，牠每秒鐘共有七十五萬個波浪，「三萬萬被四百除等於七十五萬」所以電浪也有分别，牠們的分别就是波浪的長短，和每秒鐘波浪的多少，</p>
<p>但是一處發出電浪來，還有一處怎樣能夠收到呢？這是靠着電感（ＥlectricＲesonance）的作用，什麽呌做電感？電感便是當一個蓄電池發出電浪來的時候，另一個同樣大小的蓄電池，在相當的距離外，受到牠的感化，就能收到好的電浪，這種電浪便變成電流，在那蓄電池内發生作用了，倘使那個蓄電池不是同樣的大小，那末就不會發生電感的作用，我們可做一個試騐，用兩個蓄電瓶（Ｌeyden　Ｊars）放在一尺距離的地方，再用電線作成兩個方圈，把瓶内外的錫片接連起來，但必須使一個電瓶的電線不是完全接牢，稍有一些嘑口，倘使我們在那嘑口的地方通一根很强的電流，使火星跳過這嘑口，我們就可以發現那另一個瓶的電線上也有電了，當然我們所用的電線也應當和牠的長短一樣的粗細，而平行的放置着，</p>
<p>自從我們發明電感的作用，我們就根據牠的原理造成了無線電話和無線電報，當一個人在那發音機旁講話，他高低長短絡繹不絶的聲音，影響到那隻發音機，而使牠發出不同的電浪來，這種電浪逹到我們的收音機，只要我們把這種電流影響到那發音的喇叭，而發出不同的聲音來，凡此種種電的變化，都依照那人聲音的高低輕重，所以我們聽得無線電中所發的聲音，完全像他本人的講話，一點没有兩樣的，</p>

<p>「我自從上次在××里與你相遇之後，夢寐不忘，今是又覩玉容，眞是姻緣天定，請問小姐貴姓芳名？香閨何處？多少青春？在何校讀書？請小姐詳細告訴，我倆以後可以常常通信，研究研究學問，我很盼望！」</p>
<p>我一百個不睬他，只是默默地走，但是我走得快，他也走得快，我走得慢，他也走得慢，我不耐煩了，駡他一聲，「猪　」！他還是緊緊跟着，我心中眞是又氣忿，又慌張，千幸萬幸碰着了你，那個「赤老」才逃走了，你不來，我還要多受一刻苦悶的糾纒哩！」她說完了，有些難爲情的樣子，</p>

<p>— 丁奴</p>
<p>在滿富着異國情調的霞飛路上，我的朋友新近發現了一件秘密，我想到，這個秘密也許很多人不知道，讓我在這裏把它公開吧，</p>
<p>事實是這樣，在一天春風沉醉的午晌，我的朋友從下公園裏回來，在一個車站裏，踏上了電車，這時候，人是踴擠着，凑巧得很，我的朋友的面前，却擠來了一個異國少婦，髮是捲着，唇是染着口紅，穿了一件很貼體的紅色衣裳，飄飄然有如仙女之慨，電車是風馳電掣的向前走去，從這位少婦的身邊，頻頻吹過來肉感的氣味，使得我的朋友陶然欲醉，時候是春天，眼前站着的又是春天的人物，我的朋友自然只好讓春色的芬芳來陶醉他的意識了，</p>
<p>我的朋友只是呆着，不管那位異國少婦的頭已貼靠着他的胸脯，那位少婦以後做了些什麽舉動，我的朋友一點都覺不着了，</p>
<p>只有一個時候，他的帽子好偈是觸了仠麽東西，他定睛翻過去看時，原來他的旁邊是站着一位外國長子，這位長子，一眼看去誰都明白是那一國度裏的人，他們雖然有國家，但他們的國家是不容納他們，這是我們熟悉的白俄了，當下我的朋友，並不當做一件事，一顧之後，仍舊站着原位，一直等到那位少婦下了電車，他纔若有所失似的轉了一個身，走進車廂裏坐着了，</p>
<p>待他回到家裏，摸一摸他的衣袋，銀包却不翼而飛了，他愕然，纔懂得剛纔那位少婦的對他親暱，是什麽意思，</p>
<p>瞎三話四</p>

<p>進娛樂塲的目的，大家都爲的平日做事或讀書過於煩悶，找一點開心開心！然而事實徧不是這樣。</p>
<p>一天，我的朋友極高興，而且知道我極窮，所以請我看電影，同時還請了幾位Ｍiss，進了一個較闊的影戲院，那時已是開映了幾分鐘了，我們便都在黑暗中隨着招待員電筒光的方向，找着了坐位。</p>
<p>這時大家都在靜默中，一幕一幕的看見電影過去，同時有一位英文很流俐的Ｍiss，在念着銀幕上的字。</p>
<p>一瞬兒，我後面忽然有兩位Ｍiss哭起來了，我們都奇怪地向後看，我的朋友並問什麽？</p>
<p>一位女士這樣說：啊！原來是有一位多情的Ｍiss，爲的同情電影裏的悲哀！所以哭。</p>
<p>當時我便想到世界上這種憑書吊涙的人，是很多的，但在我看起來，這電影的情節，並不十分好，有一兩幕比較緊張一點的地方，那時只是使我呆住了一些時，究竟不值得哭，因此我便發現了女子的確比較男子軟性。</p>

<h3 id="e1">In Memory of the Martyred Soldiers and Officers of the Shanghai Battle <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>From the outbreak of the January 28th Shanghai Incident to today, it has been exactly four months. Today, as we stand beneath the half-masted flag fluttering in the wind, we express our utmost respect and sorrow with the deepest sincerity for the loyal and heroic soldiers and officers who died in the Shanghai battle. Indeed, a myriad of emotions surge within us, and we are overwhelmed with grief.</p>
<p>Recalling the sudden outbreak of the Northeastern Incident last year, under the chaotic order of non-resistance, half of our nation's territory was lost in an instant. To this day, thirty million of our compatriots remain trapped in misery, unable to free themselves. When the Shanghai Incident erupted, the Japanese soldiers also boasted that they could occupy Shanghai within four hours. Clearly, they had long regarded our country as if it were devoid of people. If not for our loyal and heroic soldiers and officers, who rose up with courage and might to resist and engage in fierce close combat, the three million people of Shanghai might have suffered the same fate as their compatriots in the Northeast. The nation would not have perished, but they would have been enslaved. As for the situation in Shanghai today, it is impossible to imagine what it would be like. This, then, is the first of the great achievements of the loyal and heroic soldiers and officers, forever engraved in our hearts and never to be erased.</p>
<p>In recent decades, foreign criticism of our country has been divided. Those with good intentions see us as a sleeping lion, while those with malicious intent see us as a cowardly and incompetent nation, a weakling deserving of elimination. Before the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, most people were certain that our country would not resist and tacitly accepted the notion that the Japanese would occupy Shanghai within four hours, considering it no exaggeration. Clearly, they had long regarded our country as if it were devoid of people. If not for the arduous and determined battles of our loyal and heroic soldiers and officers, who repeatedly thwarted the strong neighbor, forcing the Japanese to replace their commander three times, how could we have refreshed the eyes and ears of the international community and changed their perceptions? The glorious battle of one month and two days was enough to show the world that the sleeping lion has now awakened and that our nation has not lost its spirit of independence. This, then, is the second of the great achievements of the loyal and heroic soldiers and officers, forever engraved in our hearts and never to be erased.</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, there has been war every year. Battles to seize cities resulted in corpses filling the cities, and battles to seize land resulted in corpses covering the fields. The soldiers and officers who died on the battlefield and the innocent compatriots who perished are too numerous to count. The enormous losses and the tragic devastation are truly unbearable to recall. However, among all the battles of the past twenty years, only the Northern Expedition was a meaningful war, and the soldiers and officers who died in the Northern Expedition made a valuable sacrifice. The rest were all aiding the wicked, serving as tools for individuals, and acting as lackeys for warlords. Their deaths were less significant than dust. The Battle of Shanghai, however, was a glorious war to uphold justice and fight for the survival and freedom of our nation. The deaths of the soldiers and officers who died in the Shanghai battle were also glorious and great. Because of this battle, some military personnel came to realize the truth and vowed never to participate in internal wars again. Because of this battle, many patriotic people were alarmed by the impossibility of any further internal wars and launched a movement to abolish them. Therefore, this battle was like a resounding bell that shattered our nation's twenty-year obsession with internal war. Its impact on our nation's future is profound. This, then, is the third of the great achievements of the loyal and heroic soldiers and officers, forever engraved in our hearts and never to be erased.</p>
<p>Alas, the setting sun shines on the desolate weeds, and the battlements remain forever. The crimson bloodstains shine with the sun and moon. The martyred soldiers and officers, though dead, are not truly dead. We believe that today's commemoration of the martyred soldiers and officers should not merely consist of lowering the flag to half-mast, offering wreaths, reading elegies, and offering silent condolences. Instead, it should consist of inheriting the loyal, heroic, and valiant spirit of the soldiers and officers who defended the country, protected the land, resisted aggression, and fought against Japan. Furthermore, we have a suggestion to make. The martyred soldiers and officers have already made a loyal and heroic sacrifice for the country and the nation. However, the elderly parents, orphans, and widows of these soldiers and officers have lost their means of support, a situation that is truly heartbreaking. Not long ago, someone proposed educating and raising the bereaved families, but now that proposal has faded into silence. We believe that this is necessary to commemorate the martyrs, honor virtue and reward merit, and encourage those who come after us. We deeply hope that the people of the country will unite their efforts to make this a reality.</p>

<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Memorial Text: On May 28th, the 21st year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, respectfully offers flowers and clear wine to the spirits of the soldiers and officers of the 19th Route Army who died in the anti-Japanese war, saying: Alas, the country is unfortunate, and foreign insults come frequently. Stupid and ugly barbarians plunder our land and attack our cities. The fires of Liaoning have not yet been extinguished, and the Shanghai Incident arises again. Wherever the enemy cavalry goes, the sight is heartbreaking. Our soldiers and officers uphold the Three Principles of the People, unite and help each other, and cherish the spirit of kinship. They defend the country against insults and bravely disregard their own safety. They enter Cai during the snowy night, and their crimson blood adorns a thousand springs. Our soldiers and officers are loyal and brave heroes. They climb cliffs, cross the sea, and march far away. They do not sleep at dawn, and they build fortresses. Their eyes reach thousands of miles, and sorrow spreads throughout Jiangnan. Our soldiers and officers are the vanguard of the people. They fall forward and follow one another, and their swords pierce the clouds. Xian Zhen loses his life, and Peng Qing's chest is pierced. Their heroic souls are brilliant and will forever guard Shanghai. Our soldiers and officers leave behind the fragrance of their leopard skins. For the Party and for the country, we mourn the national tragedy. The fire of Wujiang and the spiritual light of the Huangpu River. We whip our horses and look east, at the sunset over the old fortress. We wave our spears and shake the sun, vowing to sweep away the demons. We cry for our positions and look around with sobs. We pour wine and offer sacrifices, waiting for the cloud chariot. May the spirit flag descend and enjoy our pure offerings. Alas, may you enjoy the offerings.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's Memorial Text: On the year 21 of the Republic of China, Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, respectfully offers fragrant flowers to the spirits of the soldiers and officers who died in the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai, saying: Alas, the country's steps are difficult, and strong neighbors press upon us. They pursue militarism, exhaust their soldiers, violate alliances, break faith, ignore our sovereignty, and abuse our people's lives. We have endured much, and they have become arrogant. Gods and men are angered, and we rise up in righteous indignation. We vow to fight to the end, without fear or arrogance. With a wave of our arms, our voices pierce the clouds. Falling forward and following one another, like lightning and thunder. The events are pressing, and the killing intent is extremely fierce. Cannonballs fly horizontally, and machine gun bullets rain down. The day is dark, and blood and flesh mix together. We still go forward despite a hundred deaths, unyielding and indomitable, and we do not shirk from any difficulty. Victory reports are frequently sent, and news spreads throughout the streets. People at home and abroad sigh in admiration. We do not act recklessly in the face of danger, and we walk through danger as if it were nothing. The ardor of sacrificing oneself for righteousness is rarely recorded in history. Alas, we mourn that you diligently served the country with your death. Rituals have their constant principles, and the imperial library will discuss your merits, and the pure history will record your achievements, which will be forever displayed between heaven and earth, and we will prepare ample mourning and honor. Your heroic souls are not far away and should come and enjoy the offerings. Alas, may you enjoy the offerings.</p>
<p>Chen Jitang's Memorial Text: Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group, leads all the soldiers and officers to offer fragrant flowers, clear wine, and delicious food, and specially sends representative Yang Dezhao to offer sacrifices to the spirits of the soldiers and officers who died in the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai, saying: Alas, China is unfortunate, and turmoil occurs frequently. The red atmosphere is still hot, and the water bandits invade. The Northeast has fallen, and the Shanghai war has begun. Our soldiers and officers are filled with righteous indignation and rise up to resist the enemy, fighting for the country's honor. They fall forward and follow one another, regarding death as returning home. The fierce offensive is repeatedly thwarted, and the world is shocked. The attempt to swallow Wu has not succeeded, and we grieve over the sudden sacrifice. The whole country mourns and the three armies shed tears. Your names will remain in history, and your achievements will shine like the stars. Alas, the national crisis has not ended, and we look eastward with sadness. We rely on your spiritual power to restore our national territory. Our humble sincerity is briefly expressed, and we offer pure wine. May your souls not be ignorant and come and enjoy the offerings. May you enjoy the offerings. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>No Secret Records or Attachments</p>
<p>Luo Wengan Introduces Guo to Journalists</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 27th afternoon, Luo Wengan hosted journalists, introduced Guo Taiqi, and reported on the process of concluding the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement. Guo first handed the original Chinese and Japanese translations of the agreement to the reporters for their perusal, to prove that there were no so-called secret documents. He then discussed the fact that the Chinese people seemed to have misunderstandings about the government's repeated statements, while they deeply believed in Japanese propaganda materials, and even made unfounded speculations, saying that there were secret attachments, secret records, or oral understandings. The Shanghai conference was convened based on the League of Nations resolution, and its scope of discussion was limited to ceasefire and troop withdrawal, and absolutely no political issues could be raised. This was the first point. Article 18 of the League of Nations Covenant clearly stipulates that any treaty or international contract concluded by any member state should be immediately sent to the Secretariat for registration, and would not take effect until it was registered. Moreover, representatives of the four friendly nations participated in the conference from beginning to end. How could they violate the spirit of the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty, etc., and discriminate to conclude secret agreements that infringe upon China's sovereignty? This was the second point. Furthermore, there were no formal records of this Shanghai conference. Only the two sides kept their own records and reported them to their respective governments. After each meeting, I sent detailed telegrams to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and there are files to be checked. This was the third point. The above three points are sufficient to prove that there is no secret agreement outside of the agreement. Today, the military has mostly withdrawn, and our side is also gradually accepting it in full. The factual clarification is almost exhausted. As for the round table conference, I personally believe that if it is only to discuss the Shanghai security issue, there is no need to convene it. If it must be convened, the Sino-Japanese problem, including the entire Northeast Incident, must be discussed. (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Mingshu expressed his gratification after the resumption of postal services, saying that although the actions of the employees this time exceeded the norm, the central government still showed generosity and did not investigate. As for my responsibilities, I deeply blame myself for failing to eliminate them beforehand. However, public officials using strikes to coerce the government, regardless of whether it is well-intentioned or malicious, is not permitted by law. I am deeply grateful to the various organizations in Shanghai for their well-intentioned advice to the postal workers, which quickly resolved the situation. People in Shanghai suggested establishing a research institute for the postal economic system. If it does not violate the law, the government can consider and accommodate it. Postal workers have made remarkable achievements in the revolutionary process. Even in the anti-Japanese war, they maintained traffic regardless of their own safety. Their loyalty and patriotism are no different from the soldiers who shed blood on the front line. Although I am the minister, I am the same as the lower-level postmen in the wartime post office, serving the government. This time, the postal staff can repent, so that the national discipline will not be destroyed. As long as I am in office, I will follow the principle of love and sincerity, and do my best to be loyal to my duties, in order to maintain the post office from failure. (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Cai Peitan, Director of the Yangtze River Waterway Management Association, said that the Yangtze River is inevitably going to have the same flood as last year, because there is a lot of silt in the Yangtze River. During the low water period between Anqing and Hankou, there are eleven places that obstruct navigation. The Wusongkou has also been congested in recent years. Fundamental dredging cannot be completed without 50 million. A quick fix cannot be done without millions. The quick fix methods are: 1. Build embankments. 2. Dredge the Wusongkou. The five teams of the association's surveying team have stopped surveying work due to funding problems. The Shanghai dredging project is too small, and I am afraid it will not help.

They met with Zeng Zhongming yesterday afternoon and Wang Jingwei at Shenshi (3-5 pm) today, reporting that Inner Mongolia is being incited by both Japan and the Soviet Union, and some princes are being used by Japan. The situation is critical, but the entire population of the leagues and banners consistently supports the central government. They heard that the central government intends to send a commissioner to pacify the area, and plans to appoint Ma Fuxiang, who has no connection with the Mongolian banners and is separated by religion, as the pacification commissioner, which will only increase the confusion in Mongolia. The people of the leagues and banners unanimously oppose this. If the public sentiment is agitated, those on the left will attach themselves to Outer Mongolia, and those on the right will unite with Japan, which is not a blessing for the country. Please stop this proposal. Wang agreed to accept their petition. As for Zhangjia being the Mongolian Enlightenment Envoy, the enlightenment only belongs to the religious part, which is different from the political nature of comforting and pacifying.

<p>All newspaper offices are advised to note the following from a telegram from Heilongjiang: Since the brutal Japanese iron hooves broke through the Northeast, the comrades of this association have cooperated with Chairman Ma wholeheartedly to jointly seek strategies to resist the enemy. Afterwards, due to the fact that the traitors acted as accomplices and were willing to kneel down as slaves, and the brutal Japanese wolves were by nature ferocious, they were determined to destroy Heilongjiang before giving up. Our Heilongjiang Province is located in a corner, isolated and without assistance. As a last resort, we discussed a proper solution with Chairman Ma to cope with the harsh environment. Chairman Ma believes that if you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you get the tiger's cubs? If you don't serve Fucha, how can you turn Wu into a memory? Therefore, he endured humiliation and did not hesitate to delve into the bandit ranks to explore the true face of Japanese aggression and prepare for the adoption of the principles of the League of Nations. In terms of form, this association telegraphed on February 2 to temporarily suspend work in order to avoid Japanese suspicion. In terms of substance, secret work has not dared to cease. This is because we have been planning with Chairman Ma for a long time and have long had a comprehensive plan, proceeding separately to await the opportunity. Now, as the League of Nations investigation team comes to the East, Chairman Ma's telegrams are full of words, exposing the Japanese conspiracy. This association will also formally continue its work. At this moment, the party, government, military, and people of Heilongjiang Province are united and solid, and will fight the Japanese to the end, determined to restore the Black Water and White Mountains one day. We hope that all compatriots across the country will make a decision immediately and not hesitate any longer, so as not to miss the opportunity. This is our earnest prayer. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee bows. (11th)</p>

<h3 id="e75">Proposed Policy Guidelines <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Adopting an Aggressive Policy Towards the Eastern Provinces: Special Assembly to Convene on the First of Next Month; British and Russian Newspapers Comment on a Glimpse of the New Cabinet</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 27th – The Japanese cabinet held its second cabinet meeting this afternoon, deciding on the content of the Prime Minister's policy address to the 62nd National Diet. It is reported that the outline will be: (1) adopt an aggressive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia; (2) stabilize the morale of the nation; (3) implement social policies to eliminate social unrest; (4) alleviate the hardships of rural areas; (5) rectify military discipline and maintain the credibility of the national army; (6) eliminate corruption in political circles; (7) renovate and rebuild the financial sector. The above seven items have been handed over to Secretary-General Shibata to begin drafting.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 27th – It is learned today that a special assembly is scheduled to convene on June 1st, lasting approximately two weeks. On the opening day, the government will announce its policies on foreign affairs, finance, and all administrative matters. The main purpose of the assembly is to pass the budget proposal and other financial plans. According to sources in political circles, the foreign policy is likely to be slightly more lenient than that of the previous cabinet. Although the financial policy will be slightly more expansive, there will be no major changes.</p>
<p>Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 27th – After the formation of the Saito cabinet, it was originally intended to appoint Kodama Hideo, from the Seiyukai party, as the Governor-General of Taiwan. However, Nakagawa Kenzo, from the Minseito party, has suddenly been appointed as the Governor-General of Taiwan. Therefore, the Seiyukai party is strongly criticizing the new cabinet's personnel appointments. Because Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai is a member of the Minseito party, and now Nakagawa, another member of the same party, has been appointed as the Governor-General of Taiwan, it goes against the spirit of forming a non-partisan cabinet this time. As a result, both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are paying close attention to the allocation of party positions for the local officials who must be replaced in early June.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 27th – Retained Minister of the Army Araki said to people regarding future policies: "The most urgent task at present is the control of the military. The general policy has already been decided, and we will implement it steadily from now on. The issues of Manchuria and Mongolia, as well as other aspects, will also proceed according to the established policies."</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Dalian, 27th – President Uchida yesterday received another telegram from Prime Minister Saito, urging him to accept the position of Foreign Minister in view of the importance of the current situation. Uchida, however, is currently in Dalian with an investigation team and unable to leave his position. He is temporarily withholding his response until he decides whether to go to Tokyo.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 17th – This morning, Russian newspapers expressed significant satisfaction with the appointment of Viscount Saito as Prime Minister of Japan, stating that Saito had organized groups to promote Russo-Japanese friendship, which shows that he has no animosity towards Soviet Russia. They hope that the new Prime Minister will continue to uphold this policy and seek closer economic cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th – The Times newspaper published an editorial today criticizing the new Japanese government, stating that Saito's leadership of the new government suggests that Japan may restore the methods that were effective before 1918, namely, that the Prime Minister has no real relationship with parliamentary parties, in order to cure the country's political ills. The people do not like radical ideas, so they tolerate the military's interference in politics. Although the Shanghai adventure is now considered a mistake, the whole country has not diminished its determination that Japan should have the final say on the issue of the Three Eastern Provinces. It can be seen that this political crisis is an internal affair. The Times also stated that the fundamental reason for Japan's unrest lies in its economic situation. The new government can only adopt gentle methods until the general economy recovers, but this may not be able to appease those who criticize the government. The new Prime Minister and his cabinet members still face enormous difficulties in the future. Although the Prime Minister is known for his mildness, it is feared that he will not be able to improve his relationship with the military cliques. Therefore, the Prime Minister must hope that Geneva or Washington will not say or do anything to enrage Japanese extreme nationalists, because they are still in a frantic and dangerous state.</p>
<p>Japanese Navy Celebrates</p>
<h3 id="e76">Anniversary of the Russo-Japanese War <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Containing Profound Significance, Obata Comforts Japanese Residents in Germany, Saying the Two Countries Are Not Likely to Engage in War; Japan United Press, Tokyo, 27th – Today is the 27th anniversary of the Japanese Navy's victory in the Russo-Japanese War. The then-Admiral Togo and other naval officers held a celebration at the Suikosha Naval Club. At around 11:00 am, the Emperor, accompanied by Minister of the Imperial Household Iki and Chamberlain Suzuki, attended the event, having lunch with the officers and listening to the old generals' wartime stories. The meeting adjourned at 3:50 pm.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 27th – This Navy Day, marking the first since the end of the major wars in Manchuria and Shanghai, holds a profound significance. The Japanese naval authorities held a grand commemorative celebration this morning. The Emperor-Generalissimo attended the event, with Admirals Yamamoto and Togo, along with over nine hundred other naval officers and soldiers, participating.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 27th – In recent days, there have been repeated alarming reports that Russia and Japan are on the verge of a split. Today, Russian newspapers published a comforting statement by Obata, the Japanese ambassador to Berlin, regarding this matter. Obata told representatives of the Association of Japanese Residents in Germany that the Japanese government always exercises extreme caution in respecting the legitimate interests of Soviet Russia in northern Manchuria and strives to avoid discrimination. The Japanese government has repeatedly announced to the Soviet Russian government that the sole purpose of Japan's military operations in northern Manchuria is to protect Japanese residents. We firmly believe that Soviet Russia will be able to understand Japan's intentions and not harbor feelings of fear. Japan Secretly Proceeding</p>
<h3 id="e77">Planning to Facilitate a Roundtable Conference <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Difficult to Hold if China Does Not Participate; British Undersecretary Answers Questions from Labor Party Members; British Embassy Cannot Practically Move to Shanghai</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th – Labor Party MP Jones asked the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons today about the negotiations with the Japanese government to prepare the agenda for a roundtable conference between the major powers to discuss Shanghai. He asked if the Chinese government should be invited to join from the very beginning of the negotiations and requested that the British government guarantee that it would not participate in the discussion unless the Chinese government fully participated. He also stated that no changes to the status of the Shanghai International Settlement should be sought without the consent of the Chinese government, as the League of Nations General Assembly resolution on March 11th stated that attempting to resolve disputes under military pressure violates the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant. The Foreign Secretary was absent, and Undersecretary Eden answered on his behalf. He stated that the Japanese Foreign Minister recently invited the ambassadors of several countries stationed in Japan to secretly discuss convening a roundtable conference in Shanghai according to the League of Nations Council proposal of January 29th. However, this secret talk should not be called negotiation. Eden continued that the roundtable conference would not be able to take place without the participation of the Chinese government. As for the agenda, it has not yet been considered, but the conference should abide by the principles of the League of Nations General Assembly's resolutions on the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th – Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden answered various questions from members of parliament regarding the China incident in the House of Commons this afternoon. One member asked if the government would consider it an economical measure to move the British Embassy in Peiping to the Shanghai International Settlement and disband the embassy guard. Eden replied that moving the embassy was practically impossible and would not necessarily save money. Several members then questioned the abduction of British missionary Fairclough in Anhui and the shooting of British Vice-Consul Collins during a rescue attempt. Eden replied that the government was extremely concerned about the attacks and kidnappings of British citizens, and Minister Lampson had urged the Chinese Foreign Minister to quickly arrest and prosecute the Chinese soldiers who shot the British Vice-Consul.</p>

<p>National Socialist Party and Socialist Party Engage in a Major Fight; Lu Zhonglian Uses His Body as a Screen</p>
<p>National News Agency, Danzig, 26th – Yesterday's martial drama in the Prussian Assembly has spread to the Danzig Free City Assembly today. Members of the National Socialist Party and the Socialist Party actually exchanged punches. Fortunately, other members used their bodies as shields, interposing themselves between the warring factions, which managed to quell the disturbance. During the melee, the audience in the gallery were driven out by the police because some of them were members of the two parties' action squads preparing to join the all-out brawl.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 26th – The Vienna City Government, in commemoration of the bicentennial of George Washington's birth, is about to name a newly built civilian apartment building after Washington. Today, the American Minister was invited to attend the inauguration ceremony. Just as American Minister Stocking was about to accept the silver key to the gate and deliver a short speech, four members of the Communist Party suddenly staged a demonstration, protesting the death sentences of four black men in the United States who allegedly assaulted a white woman. At the same time, hundreds of Communists in the audience shouted slogans such as "Down with America!" and "Liberate the Black People!" The police rushed in to suppress the disturbance and restore order. The American Minister hastily delivered his speech and left. Afterward, several people threw stones at the American Minister's car, but fortunately, they did not hit it. This afternoon, Austrian Chancellor and Foreign Minister Dollfuss personally visited the American Minister to express the Austrian government's apology.</p>
<p>Economic Decline</p>

<p>Unemployed Workers Repeatedly Riot</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 26th – The long-simmering unrest in Germany due to economic decline and political tension suddenly erupted today. Several cases of brawls between members of the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party occurred in Berlin, resulting in six serious injuries, but they were relatively minor. In Dortmund, a large group of unemployed workers defied orders to disperse and attacked the police in a fierce battle, resulting in one death and fifteen injuries, including several police officers. In Hamburg, the Communists opened fire first, wounding one police officer, and the police were forced to open fire on the Communist protesters, seriously wounding six. In Düsseldorf, a large group of unemployed workers smashed shops, cars, and trams in the downtown area and looted goods. Later, a large contingent of police arrived, fired blank shots, and dispersed them.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 26th – Yesterday's violent brawl in the Prussian Assembly is still the topic of public conversation today. As for who is to blame, opinions are divided and there is no consensus. It is feared that there will never be a verdict, as both sides refuse to investigate. The newspapers of the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party, of course, blame each other, but based on what has been heard and seen, the Communists were the provokers. However, most commentators believe that no matter how provocative the Communists are, political disputes cannot be resolved by exchanging punches. The public believes that this case has strengthened Bruning's hand in negotiating the reorganization of the cabinet and resetting policies, which is currently underway behind the scenes and will be ready when President Hindenburg returns to Berlin next week.</p>

<p>Seven People Have Eight Opinions; A Whole Month Was Wasted on Verbal Battles; Weight Limits for Warplanes Cause Disagreement Between French and Italian Representatives</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 26th – The Naval Committee of the Disarmament Conference has completed its report, the first of all the subcommittees. The report was completed today, but after four weeks of heated debate, it is no different from what it was before the committee met. The only thing the committee members could agree on was that "the opinions of all countries are definitely not the same." Apart from this, it seemed that all the committee members believed that their own country's military equipment was purely for defensive purposes, while the military equipment of other countries was solely for the purpose of aggression. Therefore, even the most important issue of determining aggressive military equipment remains elusive. The report lists various different claims, with no fewer than twenty-five claims on this issue. For example, there are four identical claims regarding battleships, and the other twenty-one are different. As for retaining aircraft carriers, only eight countries are in slight agreement, while the other eighteen have different opinions.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 26th – The various subcommittees of the Disarmament Conference are currently busy discussing various data, statistics, and proposed cases. The Special Committee has passed a resolution to abolish chemical and bacteriological weapons. The Aviation Committee has added incendiary weapons to the list of prohibited military equipment.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 26th – The Aviation Committee of the Disarmament Conference met this morning to discuss the offensiveness of aircraft and how to determine it. There were two opinions at the meeting. France argued that the weight of the empty aircraft should be the standard, while Italy argued that in addition to the weight of the empty aircraft, the relationship between the horsepower of the engine and the power of the engine in the air should also be the standard. The two sides debated for a long time, and then a roll-call vote was taken. Nineteen countries supported the Italian proposal, eighteen supported the French proposal, and two abstained. Britain, the United States, and most European countries supported the French proposal. The meeting reconvened in the afternoon to continue the discussion.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 27th – Prime Minister MacDonald held a transatlantic telephone conversation with important figures in Washington on May 25th at his ancestral home of Lossiemouth. The news was heard here today, and there is much speculation. The US State Department did not comment on the news of the Prime Minister's telephone conversation, neither admitting nor denying it.

<p>Reuters, London, 27th – According to today's London Times, eight well-known British construction machinery companies have jointly formed a company specifically to develop major engineering projects in China, named Dorman Long &amp; Associates (China) Ltd. It will contribute its specialized knowledge to the Chinese authorities to promote engineering plans, and it is reported that it can also provide convenience in terms of capital. According to an official of a major company associated with the new company, China has great hope for the future if it has a stable political system. It is reported that Freeman, who went to China last year for the new company's affairs, will soon go to China again to have final discussions with representatives of other related commercial firms, so that they can put forward joint recommendations with various details for implementing great plans. In addition to undertaking great engineering projects, the new company also aims to promote Sino-British friendship, and it intends to draw the attention of the Chinese authorities to the value of past British engineering achievements and the new works that China still needs, so that it can keep pace with the industrial needs of the new era.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Defense Against Impeachment <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Also Says He Thinks of Resigning Every Moment</p>
<p>When the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang held its Standing Committee meeting on the 24th, Wang Jingwei made a report on the impeachment case by the Control Yuan regarding the Shanghai Armistice Agreement. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said, "Since hearing the news that Control Yuan President Yu Youren impeached me on the grounds that the Shanghai Armistice Agreement had not been passed by the Legislative Yuan, I immediately made two decisions. The first is that the Shanghai Armistice Agreement cannot be overturned, and the second is that I personally am willing to accept the impeachment. Why can't the Shanghai Armistice Agreement be overturned? On April 30th, the Executive Yuan sent Vice Foreign Minister Xu Mo to attend the Legislative Yuan to report on the content and process of this agreement. On May 3rd, after reporting on the content and process of this agreement to the 29th Temporary Meeting of the Central Political Conference, I also stated that this case had been reported to the Legislative Yuan, but whether it should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval first was pending instructions. The Central Political Conference then resolved as follows: 'Since this agreement is not a treaty of peace, it should be handled according to the method proposed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and submitted to the Executive Yuan. After completion, the Executive Yuan will report to the Legislative Yuan.' According to this resolution, Mr. Yu Youren's impeachment case has no basis. According to Article 15 of the National Government Organization Law, 'Before the promulgation of the Constitution, the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Control, and Examination Yuans are each responsible to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.' Therefore, it is natural for the Executive Yuan to handle this case in accordance with the resolution of the Central Political Conference. The reason I said that the Shanghai Armistice Agreement cannot be overturned is this. The Central Political Conference's resolution that 'this agreement is not a treaty of peace' is very appropriate. Resistance and negotiation at the same time is the fundamental policy for dealing with the national crisis at present. Resistance is not a declaration of war, and a ceasefire is not peace. On January 28th, the Executive Yuan ordered the troops stationed in Shanghai to resolutely resist the Japanese army's occupation of Zhabei. On February 20th, it also rejected Japan's ultimatum. At that time, neither was approved by the Legislative Yuan. Why didn't the Control Yuan impeach me for this reason? It's because resistance is not a declaration of war. Since resistance is not a declaration of war, naturally a ceasefire is not peace. Mr. Yu Youren's impeachment case cites Article 27 of the National Government Organization Law, which states that the Legislative Yuan has the power to resolve legal cases, budget cases, amnesty cases, declaration of war cases, peace cases, and other important international matters, believing that even if the ceasefire agreement is not a peace case, it cannot but be said to be an important international matter. However, the scope of so-called 'important international matters' is very broad. Without explanation, it would be unclear which events handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be approved by the Legislative Yuan first and which should not, and there would be no certain standard, which could lead to disputes at any time. This is why I requested the Central Political Conference to decide. From one aspect, the Shanghai Armistice Agreement can be said to be important, but from another aspect, this agreement is purely military in nature and does not contain any political significance. Originally, the government paid attention to not attaching political conditions to this case from beginning to end, because the Northeast Incident and the Shanghai Incident cannot be resolved separately. If resolving the Shanghai ceasefire and troop withdrawal involves political conditions, it would violate this principle. Otherwise, the Shanghai ceasefire and troop withdrawal would only be a local cessation of hostilities. If it is regarded as equally important as a treaty of peace, it would not only be useless but would also cause a huge misunderstanding. The above are all the reasons why the Shanghai Armistice Agreement did not need to be approved by the Legislative Yuan first. Now that the Central Supervisory Committee has rejected the Control Yuan's impeachment case, there is no doubt that the Shanghai Armistice Agreement cannot be overturned. However, I personally am very willing to accept this impeachment case and resign from my position. The Central Government selected me as the President of the Executive Yuan at 10:30 pm on January 28th, and the Shanghai War broke out at 11:30 pm on the same day. At that time, although I was ill and could not bear this heavy responsibility, I really had nowhere to escape between heaven and earth. For several months, I have thought of resigning every moment. Now that I have this opportunity to relieve myself of responsibility, I can ease the conflict between the Yuans and slightly calm the emotions of my comrades. Both publicly and privately, it is beneficial and harmless. Therefore, I sincerely request the Central Executive Committee today to approve my resignation from the position of President of the Executive Yuan. If approved, I will still serve in the Central Party Headquarters as usual."</p>

<h3 id="e88">Determination to Attack Hainan Island <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Chen Ce Intercepts Taxes in Hainan, Changes County Magistrates</p>
<p>Mediation by Xiao Focheng and Hu Hanmin Fails</p>
<p>Chen Jitang Dispatches Large Land and Naval Forces in Separate Directions</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After a portion of Chen Ce's fleet sailed to Hainan Island, he immediately dispatched the Feiying and Hairui warships to strictly guard the coastline. On land, he deployed marine corps for defense. Recently, Chen Ce formally issued a proclamation, stating in brief: "Given that our eastern neighbor is encroaching and the nation is in peril, all citizens have a duty to save the country. I, the Commander-in-Chief, reflecting on the past and contemplating the future, understand that without ceasing internal strife, we cannot resist the invasion of the tyrannical Japanese, and without sincere unity, we cannot avert the crisis of our national destiny. Therefore, I lead my comrades to respectfully inform the people of the country, vowing not to participate in internal strife, but to unite in resisting foreign aggression. These humble intentions are truly based on conscience, and I trust that the wise and virtuous of the country will understand. Yet Chen Jitang, the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group, (omission) does not consider that the navy is an army of national independence and cannot be controlled according to the private intentions of anyone. Moreover, the permanent abolition of the positions of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to prevent the revival of autocracy and dictatorship has been resolved by the National Congress of Representatives and cannot be altered according to the private intentions of anyone. (omission) To implement my original intentions and avoid conflict, I have led my fleet and marine corps to relocate to Hainan Island, working hard to resist Japan and suppress the communists, awaiting the fair judgment of the Party and the country and the upholding of justice." Furthermore, after the commander of the marine corps sent by Chen Ce, Chen Qingyun, and the naval chief of staff, Chen Ding, arrived in Hainan, they made all kinds of renovations and ordered the Haikou sub-treasury to intercept all tax revenues from Hainan Island and deliver them to the First Fleet Headquarters for use. All county magistrates on the island were also newly appointed, including Chen Mingheng as the magistrate of Wenchang County, Zhou Jun as the magistrate of Lingao County, Chen Jiabing as the magistrate of Dan County, Ling Shengjiao as the magistrate of Changjiang County, Fu Dongyue as the magistrate of Lingshui County, Chen Bai as the mayor of Haikou, and Fu Shiying as the president of the Hainan Republic Daily. The marine corps headquarters is located in Keyuan, Haikou. The original four regiments of the marine corps have recently been expanded into two brigades, with Chen Ding appointed as the commander of the First Brigade and Chen Ji as the commander of the Second Brigade. In recent days, large cannons and anti-aircraft guns have been installed at the Xiuying Fort in Haikou to strictly guard and control the passage to Hainan Island. The coastal areas of Qiongshan, Chengmai, Wenchang, Lingao, and Dan County are all heavily guarded by marine corps. Zhang Huichang's air squadron also conducts aerial reconnaissance daily. In short, Chen Ce has established Hainan Island as his new base, and Hainan Island has become an independent new situation.</p>
<p>Chen Jitang himself initially wanted to use political means to settle the Hainan issue. He repeatedly sent Guangjin warship captain Zhao Guizhang to Hong Kong and Macau to persuade Chen Ce to order the ships stationed in Hainan to return to the Pearl River in Guangzhou to await reorganization. Chen Ce not only did not respond but also demanded that the Haihu and other warships detained in the Pearl River be allowed to sail to Hainan Island. Zhao returned empty-handed. Subsequently, feeling that the mission had not been fulfilled, he resigned from the position of Guangjin warship captain appointed by Chen Jitang. Chen Jitang then changed his strategy and asked Xiao Focheng and Hu Hanmin to negotiate with Chen Ce. However, Chen Ce had already taken a position of opposition against Chen Jitang, so Xiao could not move Chen Ce's heart with personal feelings. Hu Hanmin also had a peaceful proposal for Chen Ce, advocating that the original Japanese fleet be divided into a river defense fleet and a coastal defense fleet, with Chen Ce continuing to serve as the commander of the coastal defense. Chen Ce would recommend someone to be appointed by the provincial government as the commander of the river defense fleet. In addition to serving as the commander of the coastal defense fleet, Chen Ce would also serve as a special commissioner for the Hainan Island region. Whether this proposal can be realized is still uncertain, because Chen Ce's position already seems to include these two important positions, and the two or three dozen river defense ships have long been incorporated by Chen Jitang and cannot be commanded in reality. So why bother with the extra step of recommending someone to be appointed by the provincial government? Chen Jitang's intention is to fundamentally reorganize the navy. If Chen Ce is still allowed to serve as the commander of the coastal fleet and is allowed to hold out in Hainan, why is mediation necessary? Therefore, in terms of the situation, the Hainan Island incident will inevitably resort to force.</p>
<p>Recently, it was learned that the troops that Chen Jitang mobilized to attack Hainan Island include the Ranwu Regiment from Yangjiang and Yangchun, the Third Independent Regiment under Zhang Wentao, and the Ye Minyu and Zhang Wei units of the Second Army Training Regiment. They have successively departed for Gaozhou and Leizhou, awaiting the command of Chen Zhangfu, the Pacification Commissioner of the Southern District. The defense areas of Yangjiang and Yangchun that were left behind have been filled by the 15th Regiment of the Second Army under Luo Xiuli. However, Hainan Island is surrounded by the sea on all sides, requiring a large number of troops. Therefore, Miao Peinan, the head of the training division, was recently transferred to lead his troops to the southern route for support. The First Regiment of the division under Luo Cequn has been transferred from the North River to the province and will depart together with the Second Regiment under Liang Gongfu and the Third Regiment stationed in Zhaoqing. In recent days, the General Headquarters of Chen Jitang's Office of Management has been very busy preparing military supplies and has chartered two merchant ships from a certain foreign firm, which are moored at Bai'etan, awaiting orders to transport troops. The Haihu, Guangjin, Zhixin, and Jianru warships, which were recently taken over, have been fundamentally reformed, with new people replacing those above the rank of chief engineer, preparing to jointly launch a land and sea attack on Hainan Island with the land forces of Gaozhou and Leizhou.

<h3 id="e89">Three-Pronged Bandit Suppression Plan <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Lin Zhiyuan Goes to Xiamen to Meet with Various Generals</p>
<p>Fang Shengtan Goes to Yanping to Discuss Northern Fujian Defense</p>
<p>Rumors Spread Between Fuzhou and Xiamen That the Guangxi Army Will Send Two Divisions to Assist in the Suppression</p>
<p>The Situation in Quanzhou Eases Slightly, and Order is Restored</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Government recently sent Commissioner Lin Zhiyuan to Xiamen to discuss matters related to suppressing the Red Army. On the 16th of this month, he returned to the province by plane. According to Lin's report, after arriving in Xiamen, Zhang Zhen, the commander of the 49th Division, and Chen Guohui, the commander of the First Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, separately flew from Zhao'an and Quanzhou to Xiamen, where they convened several meetings with Chen Jiliang, the commander of the First Fleet of the Navy, and Lin Guogeng, the Xiamen Naval Garrison Commander. They agreed on a three-pronged plan to attack Zhangzhou. Zhang Zhen would be responsible for attacking Zhangpu from Yunxiao, Chen Guohui would be responsible for attacking Longxi (i.e., Zhangzhou City) from Tong'an, and the newly appointed commander of the Marine Corps Red Army Suppression, Lin Shouguo, would be responsible for attacking Haicheng from Xiamen, so that the bandits would be attacked from both sides and unable to attend to both. After the decision was made, Zhang and Chen returned to their original defenses to make arrangements. Lin Shouguo also went to Xianyou to summon the two former units of Lin Jizeng and Dai Jixiong to go to Xiamen, to assist the Huang Maohe Regiment of the First Brigade of the Marine Corps. The Navy sent warships to transport them to Haicheng, and the Navy also allocated 1.5 million rounds of ammunition for use.</p>
<p>Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government Fang Shengtan has arranged the military affairs of the downstream army. However, in the upstream area, after Zhu De sneaked into Tingzhou, the bandit forces were once again restless, and the newly编, newly organized, Second Division, Sixth Brigade, under Ma Hongxing, which was responsible for defending the front line of Qingliu and Guihua, declared independence, making the situation very tense. Therefore, on the 17th, he went to Yanping with Chen Peikun, a member of the provincial government, to discuss with Liu Heding, the commander of the 56th Division, the deployment of defense in northern Fujian, so as to prevent the bandits from fleeing to northern Fujian after the general offensive in southern Fujian began. He returned to the province on the 19th.</p>
<p>Since the Guangdong Army aiding Fujian retreated to the border between Fujian and Guangdong, the Party and government authorities in Fuzhou and the gentry and merchants in Xiamen have telegraphed Li Zongren, asking him to send the Guangxi Army to Fujian to suppress the bandits, and were willing to bear the military expenses. Therefore, rumors have been spreading between the province and Xiamen that the Guangxi Army will send two divisions to Fujian to assist in the suppression of bandits. However, the provincial government still received a telegram from Chen Jitang yesterday, stating that the Guangdong Army's entry into Fujian would not change the original plan. In addition to continuing to search for and suppress the remnants of the Red Army in western Fujian by the troops stationed in Wuping, Shanghang, and Yongding, he is also working with the Guangxi Army authorities to coordinate the military affairs of aiding Zhangzhou. Once the Guangxi Army troops take over the defense of southern Jiangxi, they will immediately transfer most of the Guangdong Army in Jiangxi to Fujian to actively suppress the bandits. He hoped to inform the various armies in southern Fujian to strictly guard their original defenses. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government informed Zhang Zhen, Chen Jiliang, Chen Guohui, and others.</p>
<p>安(An) The situation is tense, and the local area is in chaos. They have left their posts to come to the province. Now the provincial government, according to Chen Guohui's report, invaded Tong'an 赤匪(Red Bandits), Because our army's defense is tight, there is no gap to take advantage of, and has retreated to Zhangzhou. The situation in Quanzhou has eased, stores have resumed operations one after another, and local order has been restored. Therefore, the provincial government ordered the officials staying in the province to return to their posts in time to avoid dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>The Red Bandits in Guangfeng and Shangrao in Jiangxi Province have recently been pursued tightly by the two divisions of Xu Kexiang and Mao Bingwen. They have also fled to the Fujian border and joined forces with the local Red Guerrillas of Chong'an and Pucheng to carry out large-scale activities. Yesterday, the provincial government received an urgent telegram from Qian Yuguang, the brigade commander of the Provincial Defense Army stationed in Pucheng. They immediately telegraphed Liu Heding to quickly order the front-line troops to be on strict alert, and also telegraphed Xu Kexiang to send troops to the Fujian border to encircle and suppress the bandits, in order to eliminate them.

<p>Wuxi Silk Industry Extremely Pessimistic</p>
<h3 id="e90">Provincial Government Approves Loans with Collateral to Relieve Distress <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, previously appointed Lin Ken, the director of the office, Tan Xihong, and others to go to Wuxi, and telegraphed He Yushu, the director of the Department of Industry of Jiangsu Province, to go to Wuxi to discuss with the silk and cocoon industries the measures to relieve the cocoon market. First, a Cocoon Area Relief Committee was established, and silk factories were reorganized and work was improved. It has now been learned that the relief funds have been secured. The county chamber of commerce and the farmers' banks in various cocoon-producing areas have repeatedly appealed to the provincial government to relieve the Suzhou cocoon market. The provincial government finally agreed to allocate 500,000 yuan of loan collateral, with 100,000 yuan to relieve the Wuxi cocoon market. They sought cash from the Shanghai silver and money industries. It is said that Zhang Gongquan, the manager of the Bank of China, and Wang Zhixin, the manager of the New China Savings Bank, assisted in the process, and the loan was secured. It will soon be remitted to the Farmers' Bank for use as relief funds for the cocoon market.</p>
<p>The Cocoon Area Relief Committee held its second executive committee meeting at the Silk Factory Guild Hall at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th. Chairman Chen Zhanru discussed the items. 1. A report was given on the previous meeting of the committee, where the members, including Hua Yingchun and others, were appointed to draft three measures: loan repayment, cocoon store 代烘 (Dai Hong, 代烘焙 is bake/dry on behalf of), and silk factory reorganization. They have now been drafted separately, but there are many difficulties among them. Therefore, they will be discussed and decided at the general meeting on the 24th.</p>
<p>The Cocoon Industry Guild also held an executive committee meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the 20th because the cocoon season is approaching. Chairman Hua Shaochun discussed the items. There are hundreds of cocoon stores in the four townships of the county. This year, the silk factories have no money to buy cocoons. The fresh cocoons of each silkworm household should be 代烘(Dai Hong) by the cocoon stores. Please review. It was decided that the situation in the area should be considered and the cocoon office should be handled accordingly, and the cocoon baking matters should be designated. For example, if there are six cocoon stores in 甲zhen (Jia Town), they should cooperate and one store should 代烘(Dai Hong) dry cocoons. It was also decided to convene a spring cocoon meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the 26th.</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been unfavorable, sometimes sunny and sometimes rainy, causing great damage to the silkworms in the four townships. For example, in the 15th district (Qingcheng City), such as Qianzhou, Yuqi, Lishe, Beiqifang, and Fuzhou Village, many have died. The silkworm-raising households are dejected and have no joy. In the 5th district (Tianshang City), such as the Sitou, Zhangcun, Changan Bridge, and Guting Temple areas, a large number of silkworms are in their third sleep and about to sprout leaves, but there are also many with red heads and white stiffness. It is estimated that 40% have died. At first, the market price of mulberry leaves was 2.2 yuan per dan, but now it is only 4 jiao per dan, and no one is asking about it. The silkworm eggs in Xiaolishu, Dali City, and Qianzhan, etc., are all the Yongzi and Huqiu brands, so they are slightly better than other varieties and may make up for the loss in the future. The wheat and silkworm cocoons are also soaked in rainwater and have developed a yellowing disease. If the wheat harvest is reduced and the silkworm business is disappointing, the livelihood of the farmers will inevitably cause great panic.</p>
<p>Soong Ching Ling Plans to Establish</p>
<h3 id="e91">Wounded Veterans Factory for National Defense <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Nantong Correspondence: Ms. Soong Ching Ling, during the anti-Japanese operations of the various armies in Shanghai, established the Shanghai National Wounded Soldiers Hospital at Jiaotong University, accommodating hundreds of wounded soldiers for national defense. Famous doctors from Beijing, Hong Kong, and other places, as well as famous ladies from Hong Kong and Shanghai, were responsible for medical treatment and nursing. The hospital's expenses were also raised by Ms. Soong through donations from various places. The scale was large and praised by social figures. Although the war has ended, Ms. Soong is still making every effort to carry on and is planning to set up a military training factory, hoping to settle the loyal and brave soldiers who shed blood for the country, in order to fulfill the purpose of defending the country and rewarding meritorious service. Chen Cheng, the commander of the 18th Army, felt sorry for the many wounded officers and soldiers of the various divisions of the army over the years. Therefore, he allocated a large sum of money from the army to establish a training factory for the army at Datou, Nantong, in 1931, which was quite successful. Therefore, Ms. Soong specially sent Mr. Zheng Taipu to Nantong to inspect the factory to learn from it. Zhuang Mingyuan, the director of the factory, accompanied him on a detailed inspection of the various departments of the factory. According to Mr. Zheng, Ms. Soong originally intended to come to Nantong to inspect the factory in person, but she did not do so due to the rain. Mr. Zheng praised the organization and management of the factory very much and has returned to Shanghai to report.</p>

<p>The Shazhou 沙田 (literally sand field, refers to newly-formed arable land from river/sea silt) Case Expands into This County's Fourth District Shazhou City was originally sandy land with no fixed boundaries. In recent years, due to the accumulation of sea sand, a lot of 沙田 (Sand Field) has emerged. Therefore, the people of Shazhou, because the price of sandy land is cheap and the output is high, are competing to enclose 沙田(Sand Field) in order to enrich themselves. As a result, fights and lawsuits occur from time to time. Cao Yinnian, who is in this district, obtained 200 mu of 沙田(Sand Field) the year before last, carrying a county certificate, but it was occupied by Huang Zhulou in the name of the 福利墾植公司(Welfare Reclamation Company). Cao sued the county government, but it has not been resolved for years. This spring, he again petitioned the county government for review. Because the case was not resolved, the county government ordered the Fourth District Office to organize a custody office together with the district's Public Security Bureau, and appointed Lu Lianshi as the custodian. The Public Security Bureau also sent many police officers to assist. Unexpectedly, Huang Zhulou was very dissatisfied and repeatedly negotiated with Lu Lianshi for its return. Because Lu had a county order, he could not dispose of it without authorization. Seeing that the plan was not successful, Huang led more than a hundred people to Lu's office at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th of this month. First, he beat Lu violently, and then took away two policemen together, and burned down the office building. Later, the Xixushi Public Security Bureau rescued Lu and escaped to the city to report to the county. Huang Zhulou and several others who had gathered crowds to use force were also arrested by the Public Security Bureau and sent to the city. The county government has interrogated and detained them separately, awaiting a judicial solution.</p>
<p>The robbery of fishing boats at Hupukou In this county, Hupukou has always been a bustling fish market. Recently, cuttlefish and shad have been on the market, and fishing boats are rushing to the river to catch fish and sell them at high prices. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 18th of this month, a fishing boat surnamed Li was exporting fish at the exit. When the boat passed the Xuliujing estuary east of Hupukou, it suddenly encountered several pirate boats, who shouted for them to stop and fired warning shots. The fishermen in the fishing boat fired back with their own rifles and fought back in the cabin. In the end, because they were outnumbered, they were overtaken by the pirates. Seventy or eighty bandits boarded the boat and looted it for half an hour before leaving. The fishing boat lost more than 1,000 yuan in silver dollars and many odds and ends. They have now reported to the police station for arrest.</p>

On the way through Yuncun, he notified Zhang Jinghua, the director of the Eighth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, to send five policemen to accompany him. After arriving in Caoqiao, he contacted the town mayor Zhao Kangshou and others. He immediately led the group police to Sun's house to search. Sun's house has no less than six or seventy rooms, and the Sun Xingyuan grocery store is opened at the door. When he entered the room, Kui Sheng's brother Pusheng came out to question him. Prosecutor Guan told him the intention. Pusheng replied that Kui Sheng himself was in Shanghai and that they lived separately. His residence was locked with foreign locks. Prosecutor Guan advocated opening the locks for searching. Pusheng refused, and Mayor Zhao and others also said that they could not open the door. At this time, hundreds of thugs suddenly came and threw teacups at Guan's head. Then they launched a violent riot. Guan's head was bleeding a lot, and his waist and back were severely injured. Clerk Yin and bailiffs were also beaten and injured, and their clothes were torn. Afterwards, he managed to report to the county government and the Public Security Bureau by telephone in Banshang. They immediately sent a team to rescue him, and also conducted a large-scale search.

<p>Order to Investigate Military Roads and Waterways The counties in Jiangsu Province previously rushed to build military roads due to tight national defense. Many cases of filling waterways occurred. Now the Jiangdu County Government, because the county is along the river, has been dug and built with solid defense works by the 94th Brigade stationed in Yangzhou, and 暗壕(secret trenches) dug on the river dikes, with gun ports installed. The summer season is approaching, and the water is rising dangerously. Although the brigade commander was allowed to telegraph his troops to fill in the gun ports, there were many places where the military roads blocked the waterways. The people should dig water pipes and rebuild bridges wherever possible. Yesterday, the autonomous districts were instructed to follow this order and notify the Construction Department to fear that the military roads would block the waterways. The county was ordered to find out the situation and report it within five days of receiving the document. It was also ordered to supervise the director of the Construction Bureau to propose remedial measures for the Department's review in case of waterway blockage. Yesterday, special orders were issued to the Construction Bureau and the public offices of the 4th, 6th, 7th, and 8th districts, ordering them to find out whether the waterways were blocked at the places where the military road passes through the Qin County. The Department was notified, and the Bureau prepared remedial measures for the County Department for review. Bandits Forcefully Demand Property On the night of the 20th, a dozen bandits broke into the house of Li Dianchun, a farmer in Qiaoshu Town, and went to various rooms to search. They fired guns to threaten his daughter-in-law and forced Li to hand over his property, burning Li's tongue and smoking his eyes. Fortunately, Li's wife sneaked out of the back door and rang the gong to call for help. The bandits abandoned their loot and fled. The victim has reported the incident to the local Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation.</p>

<p>Public Buses are Destroyed In order to facilitate the people's travel, the Jiangsu Construction Department is piloting public buses in the provincial capital. Unexpectedly, they were destroyed on the first day of operation. At 9:45 a.m. on the 22nd, a public bus with the number 0822 drove out of the Provincial Government Road. When it reached the intersection of the station road, the rickshaw pullers in the city believed that the construction department was driving public buses in the city and that the livelihood of the rickshaw pullers would be taken away. They gathered two or three hundred rickshaw pullers and waited in advance. When they saw the bus coming, they swarmed forward and used stones to destroy it. They destroyed all the machines and glass. The bus drivers were also beaten. They immediately reported to the second police station stationed at the station. The patrol captain of the station led the police to suppress the incident and took the rickshaw pullers Qian Zhonghong, Yu Junsheng, and Tang Dazhong to the station. When the rickshaw pullers saw that Qian and others were detained, they also swarmed to the station, and the order was in chaos for a while. At that time, two railway workers, Lu Hengzhi and Cui Yunlong, passed by. The police officers at the station mistakenly thought they were the rickshaw pullers who caused the trouble and went forward to arrest them. Lu and others believed that they were arrested innocently and resisted, resulting in a conflict. The two workers were injured in the waist. The station police department sent the workers to the railway hospital for treatment. The arrested rickshaw pullers were sent to the fifth branch for interrogation.</p>

<p>Relief for the Silk Cocoon Market: The silkworm season in Jiaxing is approaching its peak, and large-scale silkworm rearing is coming to an end. A banking syndicate has specially raised 600,000 yuan in cash to meet the needs of cocoon merchants. The provincial government, also aiming to relieve the cocoon market, has negotiated with the banking syndicate to establish a Cocoon Market Relief Committee, raising 1.8 million yuan for cocoon merchants in various counties to borrow. However, many cocoon merchants remain hesitant, unwilling to borrow to purchase cocoons. Yesterday, key figures from the Cocoon Industry Association, including Zhang Ximin, Cha Shuxiang, Wu Heshu, and Shen Yijun, proposed establishing a cocoon-drying factory in each of the seven districts of the county for the convenience of farmers. Each factory would cost approximately 2,000 yuan, totaling 14,000 yuan, to be borrowed from local public funds and repaid after the silkworm season. Drying prices are yet to be determined; cocoons would be temporarily stored, and after their future sale, the remaining funds, after deducting all expenses, would be returned to the cocoon owners. Regulations for cocoon drying and consignment sales are currently being drafted and will be submitted to the provincial government for approval before implementation.</p>

On the 21st, they apprehended two bandits, Tong Asi and Zhao Alai, who was piloting the bandits' boat, in the Ma'an area. They confessed to their accomplices, and the detectives were preparing to apprehend other bandits when Zhao Yusheng, the town leader of the area, intervened on behalf of Zhao Alai because of kinship. He requested the release of Zhao Alai, but the detectives refused. Zhao Yusheng then ordered the local militia to confront the detectives with guns, attempting to seize their weapons, leading to a conflict that nearly resulted in gunfire. Fortunately, Squad Leader Zhou arrived and ordered the militia to disperse, resolving the situation. The detectives have now submitted evidence of the case and the resistance to arrest to the Public Security Bureau and the county government for investigation.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Letter to Foreign Chambers of Commerce</p>
<h3 id="e105">Refuting the Absurdity of a Free City <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Mislead the British Residents Association</p>
<p>Safety of Commercial Cities Based on Fairness and Justice</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the foreign chambers of commerce in Shanghai yesterday, refuting the British Residents Association's absurd notion of supporting a free city. The original letter reads: Dear Sirs, We have seen in the newspapers that the British Residents Association has sent a letter to the various foreign chambers of commerce, requesting their support for the following resolutions and expressing their views to the Chinese government, strongly advocating the necessity of convening a roundtable conference so that the major powers of the world can discuss these and other issues. Our chamber has reviewed the attached resolutions, which identify the causes of recent conflicts and disputes as: (1) The extraterritoriality courts; (2) The administrative rights over roads built outside the settlements; (3) The presence of armed troops in and around Shanghai. It claims that unless the above outstanding issues are resolved simultaneously, the recent Sino-Japanese dispute in Shanghai cannot be permanently and satisfactorily resolved. Our chamber believes that such a statement in the resolutions of an association is quite shocking. In terms of diplomatic relations, the United Kingdom is a friendly nation to both China and Japan, and there is no reason to exclusively cater to the satisfaction of one side. If only the satisfaction of Japan is considered, the Sino-Japanese dispute will be hidden and will inevitably become more prolonged and lead to more severe disasters. In terms of commercial relations, such important issues should take into account the public opinion of the merchants residing in the country. Why was consent never sought in advance, and instead, Japan's intentions and interests were followed? What is the public opinion of the merchants residing in the country? In February of this year, when the Japanese military invasion of Shanghai was at its peak, officials from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed designating Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Shanghai, and Guangzhou as free cities where no Chinese troops would be stationed forever, hoping to gauge international public opinion. At that time, our chamber issued a declaration, strongly refuting it, stating that the deployment of troops by a country cannot be subject to the interference of other countries. Most countries also scoffed at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' proposal. As a result, the Japanese side then disavowed this opinion, claiming that it was merely a private proposal by the official. From this perspective, the free city of Shanghai advocated by Japan today is merely a scene in a drama from that time. Japan's advocacy of a free city of Shanghai has two intentions: (1) Since the three northeastern provinces have already been monopolized by them, and the commerce of various countries in the three northeastern provinces has plummeted, they want to use this as a place to offer favors; (2) The Songhu war has lasted for several months, and the commerce of various countries in Shanghai has suffered greatly. They want to use this to ingratiate themselves with the various countries as a means of self-redemption. Here, our chamber dares to faithfully advise our friendly nations that the foreign merchants in China hope for the advancement of commerce and the safety of the commercial city of Shanghai, which is a common desire and a common principle. However, it must be based on fairness and justice and not seek other strategies. The goodwill of 400 million people is the most effective salesman for goods in China and the safest fortress to protect the commercial city of Shanghai. Since Japan forcibly occupied Shenyang, the commerce of various countries with China has suddenly increased compared to before. This fact is clearly evident. Japan, unable to suppress its jealousy, has proposed the free city in the hope that the various countries will initiate negotiations in order to secretly sow discord. Why? Because Japan forcibly seized our three northeastern provinces and restricted our sovereignty in Shanghai, it is naturally resented by the Chinese people. However, the matter of the three northeastern provinces was created entirely by Japan. The proposal for a free city of Shanghai was initiated by Japan first, and the various countries followed after. The Chinese people will inevitably transfer their resentment towards Japan to the various countries. This is the first step in the success of Japan's diplomatic policy, and the British Residents Association has also been misled. The cause of the outbreak of the Songhu war this time (1) can be said to be due to the Japanese naval officers' ambition to follow in the footsteps of the army warlords and make Shanghai their place of conquest. This is evident from the repeated informal declarations of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which stated that the Shanghai incident was left to the discretion of naval personnel. The truth of the incident is thus proven. (2) Since they have made the three northeastern provinces their lifeline, they also want to control the commercial arteries of the Yangtze River as their source of sustenance. However, Shanghai does not have a Japanese-controlled settlement that can be used as a base, so they want to take this opportunity to create one. In analysis, the motivation for the war on that day was nothing more than this. Therefore, the garrisoning of troops in Shanghai is by no means the real cause of the outbreak of the war. In terms of boycotts, Shanghai has had nine such boycotts against Japan. In terms of troop deployments, the presence of Chinese troops around Shanghai has been a long-standing phenomenon and did not start last year. Why has there been peace all along, but this time it suddenly erupted? Therefore, upon investigation, the three issues listed by the British Residents Association are not related to the Sino-Japanese conflict in Shanghai. As for the roads outside the settlements and the extraterritoriality courts, they are even less relevant to Japan. Japanese newspapers have never paid attention to this. If the various friendly nations want to ensure the safety of their commerce with China, they should first assist China in achieving a satisfactory resolution to the three northeastern provinces incident. Then all Sino-Japanese conflicts will naturally be eliminated. Not only will the peace and order of Shanghai be preserved, but the entire commerce with China will also increase. If this cannot be achieved for the time being, they should also exercise keen observation in every matter, stand in an impartial position, and not be dazzled by Japan's false words. It should be noted that Shanghai underwent 34 days of intense fighting this time, but the Chinese troops never entered the settlements. Even when Japan used the settlements as a base, the Chinese troops did not pursue them. Therefore, to ensure the safety of the settlements this time, only a real guarantee needs to be sought from Japan. Instead of doing this, they want to limit the deployment of Chinese troops. Such an unfair and unjust approach is naturally unacceptable to our country. Why do the various friendly nations abandon their goodwill towards China and share the blame for Japan? Therefore, the resolutions of the British Residents Association, from the perspective of the commerce of various countries with China, should not be easily supported. Our chamber dares to represent the Chinese merchants of the entire city and offer its sincere advice. We hope you will take it into consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Yiling Sinks After Striking Reef <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Accident in Yangduxi</p>
<p>Completely Submerged Within Twenty Minutes</p>
<p>All Passengers and Crew Drowned</p>
<p>The American Jiejiang Company's Yiling轮, en route from Chongqing to Shanghai, struck a reef between Wanxian and Yichang. The ship sank completely within twenty minutes, resulting in numerous passenger and crew deaths. Our reporter conducted an investigation, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Accident: The Yiling轮, carrying cargo and over forty passengers from Chongqing to Shanghai, departed Chongqing on the 23rd. At noon on the 25th, it was sailing on the Yangtze River between Yichang downstream and Wanxian upstream, in an area called Yangduxi. This area is known for its numerous reefs, making it one of the most difficult stretches for ships to navigate. Recently, the water level of the upper Yangtze River has been fluctuating sharply. The submerged reefs in this area are exposed when the water is low, allowing ships to avoid them. However, due to the rising water, the reefs were submerged, making them invisible to passing ships. The Yiling轮 was sailing downstream when the turbulent waters pushed it onto a submerged reef. The ship's hull was breached by the reef, causing it to immediately take on water and sink.</p>
<p>Rapid Sinking: According to reports, the Yiling轮's accident was caused by the ship's hull colliding with a reef due to the turbulent downstream current. The impact was so severe that the hull immediately broke, and the rushing river water caused the ship to sink within a matter of moments. The ship was completely submerged in the river within just twenty minutes, with only a section of the mast visible. According to sources within the company, the accident was caused by (1) the fluctuating water levels of the river and (2) the pilot's error in guiding the ship, causing it to strike the reef.</p>
<p>Personnel Casualties: It is reported that there were a total of forty-five passengers on board, along with over ten crew members, including sailors and stokers. When the ship struck the reef, the entire ship shook. Passengers in the cabins were trying to escape, and crew members and sailors on deck were trying to release lifeboats and life jackets. However, due to the rapid sinking, they were unable to escape. All passengers and crew were drowned with the ship, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy.</p>
<p>Shipowner Escapes Danger: Yesterday morning, the Jiejiang Company received a radio report from an American warship in Yangduxi regarding the Yiling轮's accident, stating that the shipowner, Mr. Haenesson, had been rescued and was being transported to Chongqing on the Yujiang轮, which was sailing upstream. Most of the other passengers and crew who fell into the water had been swept away by the turbulent currents or died inside the ship. Only about two or three people were able to escape after falling into the water. Detailed information has not yet been reported to Shanghai. The Shanghai office sent a telegram to Chongqing yesterday to inquire and ordered the salvage and rescue of the passengers who fell into the water.</p>
<p>Ship Loss: Among the Jiejiang Company's Yangtze River ships, the Yiling轮 was the best. It had a displacement of 300 tons, an iron hull, and an excellent engine. It had been navigating the Sichuan River for over ten years and had never run aground or had an accident. It was one of the most perfect ships on the Yangtze River. This time, it was sailing downstream from Chongqing with relatively little cargo. Now, including the mail, everything has been lost, resulting in losses of at least 100,000 yuan.</p>

The cradle of the revolution has once again faced the danger of disintegration. Looking ahead, we cannot help but feel worried and fearful. At this time of urgent foreign invasion, both the naval and air forces are crucial to national defense. Why cause such a great disturbance, causing ridicule from the enemy and heartache from our compatriots? We have recently heard that Mr. Zhang Zhan'tang has taken on the role of mediator, bringing a ray of hope. It is not too late to mend the fence. It is up to you to unanimously advocate for an immediate end to this meaningless conflict, to restore the nation's vitality, and to cherish the talents of our party.

<p>Telegram to Chen Jitang: To Mr. Chen Bonan in Guangzhou: Recently, disputes have re-emerged within Guangdong over the reorganization of the naval and air forces. All comrades who care about the cradle of the revolution are expressing their grief and regret in unison. We are even more deeply worried and fearful about the recent rumors of preparations for war. We have heard that Mr. Zhang Zhan'tang has resolutely taken on the role of mediator, and we hope for a turning of the tide. Only great courage can rein in the horse at the edge of the cliff. We implore you to prioritize the overall situation and the Guangdong situation, accept Mr. Zhang's advice, and enable revolutionary comrades to unite again and work together to overcome national difficulties. The future of the party and the nation depends on it. We offer our sincere advice and humbly request your consideration. A reply would be appreciated. (Same signatories as above)</p>

<p>Released After Waiting for a Long Time</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, yesterday (26th), there were reports of Japanese troops mistreating an American citizen to the US Consulate. It is alleged that on Monday afternoon at approximately 1:45 PM, Mr. Steiz, an American citizen from the Victor Company, along with Mr. Hand and a Briton, Mr. Glover, were driving east along Pingliang Road when a Japanese naval vehicle sped towards them, nearly forcing them off the road. Mr. Steiz informed them that they were driving recklessly and almost caused an accident. As soon as Mr. Steiz's car stopped outside the factory gate, the Japanese military vehicle turned back and pursued them. Five sailors, each with a bayonet and handgun, surrounded the car and forcibly pulled Mr. Steiz out of the car. They threatened him with bayonets and forced him to climb into the Japanese military vehicle. Thereupon, two colleagues and Mr. Glover accompanied Mr. Steiz into the Japanese military vehicle and were taken to the Japanese military headquarters near the Yangshupu police station. They were brought before an officer, but he did not understand English. Although Mr. Steiz had a rudimentary knowledge of Japanese, he was not fluent, and a translator was not available. After waiting for a long time, an English-speaking officer arrived, clarified the situation, and released everyone.</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Xingya, the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, arrived at the bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday to assume his duties and complete the takeover. He also announced the new staff. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>New Appointment Yesterday Morning: At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, the bureau dispatched Zhang Binghui, the chief of the Fourth Section, to Mr. Wu's private residence to welcome him. He arrived at the bureau at 10:10 AM to assume his duties. Huang Boqiao, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau; Shen Yi, Director of the Public Works Bureau; Xu Peihuang, Director of the Education Bureau; Hu Hongji, Director of the Health Bureau; Wang Yansong of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Party Headquarters; and representatives from various sectors came to the bureau to congratulate him.</p>
<p>Handover Procedures: Former Director Mai Chaoshu entrusted Mai Gongyun, chief of the First Section, Xu Jisan, a staff member, and others to handle the handover procedures. The new Director Wu dispatched Hu Xianqiao, Chen Baohua, and others to receive the files, seals, and other items. The handover was completed at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's Speech: Subsequently, Director Wu convened all 140 staff members of the bureau in the bureau's auditorium to deliver a speech. He said, "Xingya is meeting with you for the first time today, and I have two points to discuss with you. (1) The Bureau of Social Affairs, especially under the current circumstances, bears a very important responsibility and is closely related to various organizations and agencies. You have served in the bureau for a long time and should have a considerable understanding of and contribution to the various organizations and agencies in the city. Seeing that the previous directors have handled their duties and have been highly trusted by the society and the public, we can see that we must continue to implement all the plans of the previous director, prioritize the urgent matters, and deal with all the urgent matters in the society first. For example, the central government and the municipal government have comprehensive plans and instructions for the issues of relief in the war zone, and the Bureau of Social Affairs must strive to take responsibility. Fortunately, you are all familiar with the situation in the city, and you can propose concrete measures for anything that you think is required by the society and the public, and implement them after deliberation. (2) In the past, the general office staff of any agency were uneasy when there was a transition between the old and the new. This is the biggest problem in Chinese politics. For the staff themselves, the bureau."</p>

<p>Released After a Long Wait</p>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," it was reported to the American Consulate General yesterday (the 26th) that a recent incident of Japanese military mistreatment had occurred. It is said that around 1:45 PM on Monday, an American named Mr. Stauss from the Victor Company, along with Mr. Hand, and an Englishman named Mr. Glover, were driving east on Pingliang Road in a car. A Japanese naval vehicle sped towards them, almost forcing them off the road. Mr. Stauss informed them that their driving was careless and nearly caused an accident. As soon as Stauss's car parked outside the factory gate, the Japanese military vehicle turned back and pursued them. Five sailors, each with bayonets and pistols, surrounded the car, forcibly pulled Mr. Stauss out, and threatened him with bayonets, forcing him to climb into the Japanese military vehicle. Thereupon, two colleagues from the company and Mr. Glover accompanied Mr. Stauss onto the Japanese military vehicle. They were taken to the Japanese military headquarters near the Yangshupu police station, and led before an officer. However, the officer did not understand English.

<p>Mr. Wu Xingya, the new Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, arrived at the bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday to take office and complete the handover. He also announced the new staff appointments. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Taking Office Yesterday Morning: At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, the bureau dispatched Mr. Zhang Binghui, the head of the Fourth Section, in a car to welcome Mr. Wu from his private residence. He arrived at the bureau at 10:10 AM to take office. The Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Huang Boqiao, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Shen Yi, the Director of the Education Bureau, Xu Peihuang, the Director of the Health Bureau, Hu Hongji, Wang Yansong from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Pan Gongzhan from the Municipal Party Headquarters, and representatives from various sectors all came to the bureau to offer their congratulations.</p>
<p>Handling the Handover: The former Director, Mai Chaochu, entrusted the head of the First Section, Mai Gongyun, and staff members Xu Jisan and others to handle the handover. The new Director, Wu, appointed Hu Xianqiao, Chen Baohua, and others to receive the files, stamps, etc. The handover was completed by 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Director Wu's Speech: Director Wu then convened a meeting with all 140 staff members in the bureau's auditorium. He stated, "This is the first time I, Xingya, have met with everyone. I would like to discuss two points with you: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau, especially under the current circumstances, bears a very important responsibility and is closely related to various organizations and institutions. Those of you who serve in this bureau have a long history and a considerable understanding and contribution to various organizations and institutions in this city. Just by seeing how the previous directors handled their duties and earned the trust of society and the public, you can understand. In the future, we must continue to follow the plans of the previous director and prioritize the urgent needs of society. For example, issues such as disaster relief in the war zone have comprehensive plans and instructions from the central government and the municipal government. The Social Affairs Bureau must diligently take on its responsibilities. Fortunately, all of you have a detailed understanding of the city's situation. In the future, if you have any suggestions that you believe are required by society and the public, you can propose concrete measures and consider implementing them. (2) In the past, general administrative personnel in any organization were uneasy during the transition between old and new leadership. This is the biggest flaw in Chinese politics. Staff members themselves often lose their jobs due to a lack of security, and the efficiency of the organization suffers due to frequent changes. When I served in Hubei and Anhui provinces, I did not advocate for changes to the staff. You can all continue to perform your duties as usual. I will act with impartiality and will not easily change those who work hard. This is what I hope everyone will pay special attention to." It is heard that Director Wu will hold a formal swearing-in ceremony on June 1st.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Night Trains to Resume from June 1st <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Through Train Service from Xinlonghua to North Station Resumes Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Japanese military withdrew from the North Station on the afternoon of the 23rd, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway authorities resumed the Beijing-Shanghai through train service on the 24th. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency interviewed Mr. Zheng Baozhao, the Chief of the Traffic Department of the railway, yesterday regarding the recent arrangements. According to Mr. Zheng, since taking over the North Station on the 23rd of this month, the facilities along the line from the station to Qingyang Port have been completely destroyed. Under the guidance of Director Chen, various departments have worked hard to repair the train service within 24 hours. However, there have been many difficulties. For example, most of the locomotives in the Locomotive Department could not be repaired and restored to their original condition because the Wusong Locomotive Factory was occupied by the enemy and the Nanjing and Changzhou factories were small in scale and lacked facilities. Moreover, although the railway bureau had made considerable preparations for rolling stock and equipment since the end of February, Shanghai lacked these materials, so the facilities were still inadequate. We hope passengers will understand. The railway will try to restore the original condition as soon as possible to facilitate passengers. As for the traffic conditions, most of the telegraphs, telephones, electrical signals, railway signs, and signal flags between the stations from North Shanghai to Qingyang Port were damaged. The Electrical Engineering Department was unable to restore them temporarily due to a lack of telegraph lines, telephone copper wires, and electrical machinery. All trains arriving at the station will be guided by station staff to avoid danger. Therefore, the first day of resuming train service was extremely difficult, but in order to facilitate public transportation, we are still trying our best to manage it. Starting from the 26th, we have added one round trip each of the Beijing-Shanghai through train. At the same time, the railway line from Xinlonghua on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to the North Station has also been repaired and through train service has resumed today (yesterday, the 27th), directly reaching the North Station as before. In addition, the reorganization of Beijing-Shanghai passenger trains is actively underway, but the most difficult problem is the shortage of locomotives and the damage to the facilities on passenger cars. We have asked the Locomotive Department to try to restore the original condition of the locomotives as soon as possible and to rush to install electric lights and other equipment on the cars. In short, for the convenience of the public, we have agreed with Director Chen that, no matter what, starting from June 1st, we must resume the Beijing-Shanghai night train service, that is, including the overnight trains, with four or five round trips of the Beijing-Shanghai through train and three or four round trips of the local trains each day, and try to restore freight trains. During this difficult planning period, we hope for the understanding and assistance of all sectors to restore the original condition as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Cotton Yarn, Sugar, and Paper Industries</p>
<h3 id="e116">Strictly Investigate Fellow Businesses Importing Japanese Goods Privately <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters yesterday to the cotton cloth, yarn, sugar, and paper trade associations, requesting a strict investigation of fellow businesses importing Japanese goods privately. The letter stated: "To Whom It May Concern, the Chamber has previously stated that the Japanese have not repented for their invasion of China. Their intention to annex the Northeast is a prelude to swallowing all of China. In order to survive, our nation must not abandon the economic severance of ties with Japan, regardless of how the environment changes. We have earnestly advised the various trade associations to heed this message, almost to the point of exhaustion. Upon investigation, according to recent reports in the Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun regarding the recent situation of Japanese businesses in Shanghai, it is stated that 'transactions of cotton yarn and cloth are only a small amount being transported to Qingdao and Tianjin. As for Shanghai, there are also only small deliveries. There are still many Chinese customers for the import of sugar, paper, and miscellaneous goods, but only small transactions are being made.' Judging from the situation, it is clear that there are a few black sheep among your fellow businesses who are willing to defy righteousness. As the saying goes, 'Trickling streams will become rivers.' These small deliveries and transactions at this time are only an attempt to test the waters and are the initial step towards creating a barrier for the future. Looking ahead, it is deeply disheartening. Your association is enthusiastic about saving the country and has always been relied upon by the Chamber. You should have heard about the situation reported in the newspaper. It is hoped that you will eliminate favoritism, promptly investigate and punish those who violate the agreement, and deter others from following suit."</p>

<p>People's Organizations Federation Sends Another Letter to the Committee for Clearing Seized Goods</p>
<p>The People's Organizations Federation sent another letter to the Committee for Clearing Seized Goods yesterday, expressing its opinions. The original letter is as follows: "To Whom It May Concern, we have read in the newspapers that you are seeking methods to thoroughly resist enemy goods, which shows your painstaking efforts and is greatly admired. The Federation has already submitted its opinions on resisting enemy goods to the Committee for Clearing Seized Goods. As you are one of the members of the committee, you should already be aware of them. We believe that resisting enemy goods and clearing seized goods are related. The Federation believes that if we want to plan for the long term, we must be cautious in the present. If one side is destroyed, the foundation will inevitably be undermined. You have the intention to gather broad opinions. The Federation has previously presented six opinions: (1) oppose the clearing organization; (2) continue the work of resisting goods; as for the use of the cleared goods, (1) promote domestic goods, (2) provide relief to the unemployed, (3) assist righteous armies, and (4) provide relief to disaster victims. We hope that you will present these at the meeting for discussion and not abandon them. Sincerely, To Chu Fucheng, Chen Songyuan, and all members of the Clearing Committee. The Shanghai Federation of People's Organizations, May 27th."</p>

<p>Since the central government decided to send the entire 19th Route Army to aid Fujian, the United Association of Fujianese Organizations in Shanghai was extremely pleased to hear the news. They specially appointed representatives Xie Yinpo and Pan Zuomin to bring official letters to Suzhou to visit Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, expressing the welcome of the Fujianese people to the army's entry into Fujian to suppress the communists. Xie and Pan left for Suzhou by train last night, carrying wreaths and elegiac couplets to participate in today's memorial service in Suzhou for the fallen soldiers of the 19th Route Army.</p>
<p>Beijing and Fujian Authorities</p>
<h3 id="e121">Reply to Telegrams from Fujianese Organizations in Shanghai <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>After the representatives of the United Association of Fujianese Organizations in Shanghai visited Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek in Beijing, the military aspects were arranged, and the 19th Route Army was ordered to enter Fujian as soon as possible. The association has received letters from Wang Jingwei and telegrams from Fang Shengtao and Zhang Zhen in recent days, which are detailed below:</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's letter (title omitted): "I met with you yesterday and received your letter. I am aware of everything. The fall of Zhangzhou has shocked all of Fujian. My colleagues in the government are deeply concerned. We have discussed the situation in detail with the Military Affairs Commission for several days and have reached a general decision, which will be announced soon. I hope you will understand. However, suppressing the communists should not rely solely on military force, but also on political reform. Military force is a temporary solution, while politics is the fundamental solution. Both should be emphasized. I hope that people's organizations can cooperate sincerely with the government to curb the rise of unrest and achieve governance. This is my heartfelt wish. Signed, Wang Jingwei."</p>
<p>Fang Shengtao's telegram (title omitted): "I have received your telegram. The communist scourge in our homeland must be eliminated as soon as possible. We are actively planning and, as soon as the arrangements are in place, I will personally lead the provincial departments to eliminate them. I am ashamed that inadequate precautions have caused you to be concerned from afar. Thank you for your encouragement. I will work hard to live up to your expectations. I hope that you, who care for our homeland, will provide guidance at any time so that I may improve. Signed, Fang Shengtao."</p>
<p>Zhang Zhen's reply telegram (title omitted): "I have received your telegram. The communist scourge concerns the whole country and is not a local issue. The plan to suppress the communists requires overall planning and cannot be accomplished by a small number of troops. The main forces of the communists entering Fujian are the First and Fifth Army Corps. The forces attacking Zhangzhou were the elite of these army corps. The Third, Fourth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Armies, and several independent divisions, totaling about 30,000 men, were after the battle of Shiyong in Longyan, we could only gather our forces, defend the key passes, and fight hard for more than ten days. The enemy and our forces suffered about 4,000 casualties each. Exhausted and without reinforcements, I painfully took responsibility for abandoning the city. The situation in Fujian is complex, and Zhang has spread rumors, saying that we retreated without a fight. The facts are there and need no explanation. I have been stationed in Zhangzhou for four years and have always strived to build up the region in various ways. I am committed to our homeland and, as a soldier, I would not abandon Zhangzhou unless absolutely necessary. This heart of mine will be understood by those who know the situation. We are reorganizing our forces and striving to counterattack. The vanguard has advanced to Zhangpu, Shijiao Dong, Punan, and other places. If we can get help from friendly forces, we will be able to recover Zhangzhou in the near future. The newspapers in the country are a reflection of evil intentions. After the communists invaded Zhangzhou, provincial news even reported that Sun Lianzhong or the Guangdong army were passing through to resist the Japanese. The disruption and absurdity are truly heartbreaking. You, who love your homeland and country, must be aware of the facts and not be blinded by rumors. As long as I have breath, my will will not falter and I will not abandon my responsibility. We must fight to the end together. Signed, Zhang Zhen Ma."</p>

<p>For the Purpose of Relieving Aged Silk and Cocoons in Factories</p>
<p>Grading and Mediation Committees Established</p>
<p>Regarding the relief of silk and cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the government has ordered the suspension of the collection of export duties on raw silk and the surcharges on the silk industry public bond fund from May 18th. In addition, a subsidy of 100 taels per dan will be given when they are sold abroad. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments have decided to first issue treasury bonds of four million yuan. While the treasury bonds are being printed, preliminary receipts will be used as substitutes. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Committee for Reorganizing Aged Silk and Cocoons in Factories has established two committees: a grading committee and a dispute mediation committee. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment of Grading Committee: The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Committee for Reorganizing Aged Silk and Cocoons in Factories resolved at its sixth executive meeting to establish a silk and cocoon grading committee. Cai Wuji, Shen Huachen, and Zhu Jing'an were appointed as members, and experts Ren Fengkui and Huang Jinfan were hired as consultants to handle the grading of exported silk. It was announced yesterday that the committee has been established and will begin operations immediately.</p>
<p>Establishment of Mediation Committee: The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Committee for Reorganizing Aged Silk and Cocoons in Factories resolved at its sixth executive meeting to establish a dispute mediation committee. Shen Qingsheng, Qin Runqing, Feng Zhongqing, Ye Zhuotang, Li Zufa, Zhu Jing'an, and Shen Huachen were appointed as members to handle disputes between the silk and cocoon industry and the silver and money industries regarding collateral loans. It was announced yesterday that the committee has been established and will begin operations immediately.</p>

<p>Taicang Native Place Association</p>
<h3 id="e125">Opposes the Chief County Being Moved to Jiading <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently announced that it would divide the province into fifteen administrative regions, with each region having a chief county to supervise the administration of the entire region. The method of division is to establish the chief county in the former government or prefecture seat. However, Taicang was originally a directly subordinate state, but the chief county that should have been established was changed to Jiading. The Taicang Native Place Association in Shanghai believes that the facilities are different and expresses its opposition. It called a meeting yesterday and decided to send a telegram to the provincial government requesting that the former practice be followed. The text of the telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Gu of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it is reported that all former government and prefecture seats will be chief counties, but Taicang, which should have a chief county, has been changed to Jiading, which is different. Please continue to designate Taicang as the chief county, called the Taicang Region, to show uniformity and avoid disputes. Signed, Taicang Native Place Association in Shanghai."</p>

<p>Shanghai Power Company Implements Actual Usage-Based Electricity Bills</p>
<h3 id="e128">Lu Yusheng Sends Letter of Thanks for Successful Negotiation with Ratepayers Association <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Lu Yusheng, a taxpayer in the Public Concession, previously wrote to the Chinese Ratepayers Association to negotiate with the Shanghai Power Company, which was not charging electricity bills based on actual usage. This issue has now been resolved. He sent another letter yesterday to express his gratitude, stating: "To Whom It May Concern, I have resolved the issue of the Shanghai Power Company's increased electricity fees directly and satisfactorily with the company. However, I am grateful that your association has stood up for justice and fairness, and has submitted negotiations to the Municipal Council, unyielding, so that the method of charging electricity based on actual usage can be implemented. This is all the result of your association's efforts. I should express my utmost respect, and the residents within our concession should have considerable support for your association's spirit of service. I believe that the mission your association bears is very great. Now there are increased voices for telephone, tap water, etc. in the concession. I sincerely hope that your association will continue to uphold its consistent spirit and resolutely oppose these increases so that the Chinese in our concession will not be further burdened and exploited. I also have something to tell your association: Upon examining the contract charter of the Shanghai Power Company, there are several clauses that show too much contempt for us Chinese. I hope that your association will study and correct these. Sincerely." The association replied, "To Whom It May Concern, we have received your letter of May 26th and are pleased to learn that the electricity fee issue has been resolved directly and satisfactorily with the company. This proves the company's obedience to the truth and respect for public opinion. Our association's responsibility lies in seeking the truth and expressing public opinion. We are ashamed of your praise. Regarding the issue of telephone price increases, the association has made a statement under the supervision of public opinion. The issue of tap water prices is more important to the people's livelihood than telephone and electricity, as there is no alternative. The association is studying this in detail and will be able to put forward concrete proposals soon. We are deeply grateful for your concern for municipal administration. Please also inform us of the clauses in the Shanghai Power Company's contract charter that show contempt for users so that we can proceed with amendments. We believe that the company is organized by civilized people and will follow good advice.</p>

<p>Municipal Police Bureau Conducts Household Registration Check</p>
<h3 id="e129">Notice Limited to Reporting by the End of This Month <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Residents in the Chinese areas of this city, due to the Sino-Japanese war, have moved away one after another, resulting in changes in household registration. Most of these changes have not been registered. Now, the Municipal Public Bureau considers that order is gradually returning to normal, and residents moving in and out, births, deaths, and inheritances should all be registered in accordance with the regulations, so as to emphasize the important administration of household registration. Therefore, a notice has been issued, limiting all residents to report to the police station in charge by the end of this month. While some residents have complied with the report, there are also many who have delayed in reporting. Therefore, in recent days, all police districts have sent household registration police officers to conduct detailed investigations in each household within their jurisdiction, and have also informed all residents that if there are any changes in the future, they should report them at any time.</p>

<p>Yu Yan, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, Organizes Opinions on Railways</p>
<p>Telegrams to All Routes Soliciting Rescue and Improvement Plans</p>
<p>Yu Yan, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, recently published his thoughts on reorganizing railway business and improving railway administration, stating that in the past ten years, the railway administration has been passively perfunctory, and has become increasingly degraded and corrupt, causing the railways across the country to become almost a kind of duty-bound agency. The various routes have gradually become rotten and can no longer be renovated and reorganized. Therefore, starting from the personnel aspect to reorganize, the spirit of fairness, integrity, and struggle should be the method of improvement. Abiding by the law, being open and impartial is called fairness, being legal, reasonable, and in line with national and people's well-being is called righteousness, not being perfunctory is called integrity, being clean and devoted to public service is called cleanliness, invigorating the spirit is called struggle, and striving tirelessly is called fighting. Although these three points contain many meanings, they are the only way to defeat the bureaucratization of the administration of various routes. To improve railway business, one should engage in commercialization, (A) increasing transportation efficiency, (1) recovering all military vehicles, (2) reducing the number of delayed tons of various routes and increasing the number of delayed ton miles, (3) improving the freight yards and improving the roads of various routes, (4) improving the management methods of the porters and transshipment companies of various routes, (B) promoting responsible transportation. Since the Siping-Taonan Railway began to implement it in the ninth year of the Republic of China, its business income has increased dramatically year by year, from more than one million to six million. Last year, the Beining Railway only operated eleven stations. During the year, except for three months when the route was divided by the violent Japanese, there were only nine months. Statistics show that the total turnover has increased to 40 million. From the perspective of responsible transportation alone, it has also increased by more than 3,297,000 yuan. This achievement can be used as an example. (C) Implementing commercial management methods, (1) improving the equipment of each station, (2) paying attention to scientific management methods, (3) promoting business solicitation, (4) making all rules and regulations public, (5) conducting detailed investigations of the industrial and commercial enterprises along the routes of various routes and finding ways to connect, (6) promoting domestic routes and water and land combined transportation methods. All of these are temporary solutions to the current business. As for the fundamental reorganization plan, how to reorganize the debts of various routes to restore railway credit, how to plan the engineering equipment of various routes, and increase the number of locomotives, all require huge amounts of money. This is the entire railway reorganization plan, which will be carried out at any time after discussing with the Deputy Minister of the Ministry and the various departments, in order to gradually improve. Also, Yu sent a telegram to the colleagues of the various routes, saying, "To the public of the colleagues of the various routes, I am taking the position of department director with my mediocre and shallow abilities. I have insufficient knowledge and weak ambition. I hope to add the views of loyalty and benefit, and I am not afraid to tell each other ten times. I hope to use the mistakes of other mountains to attack jade, and do not hesitate to leave a thousand thoughts behind. If there is anything that is not done, I am willing to hear good words. If you come to teach, I will wait sincerely." Yu Yan, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, has a seal.</p>
<h3 id="e132">National Goods Exhibition to Open Soon <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>June 6th</p>

<p>The Industry and Commerce Management Association Holds a Meeting Today</p>
<p>In recent years, the national products of our country have been constantly innovated and are becoming more and more developed. The excellence of their quality and the low prices are especially beyond the reach of foreign products. However, there seems to be a lack of research on the methods of promotion, resulting in a large market being occupied by foreign goods. The China Industry and Commerce Management Association, in view of this, has invited the same opportunity to hold a luncheon meeting at the Lianhua General Association at No. 3 Beijing Road at noon today to discuss together, and has also invited Mr. Huang Shoumin, manager of Taishan Bricks and Tiles Company and Puyi Yarn Factory, to attend the meeting and give a speech entitled "My Views on the Method of Promoting National Goods." Mr. Huang has spared no effort in promoting national goods, especially in the method of promotion, he has always had a deep understanding. At this time of resisting goods, the promotion of national goods is the most important thing. It is expected that the participation in the meeting will be very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the China Southeast Main Association of the World Red Swastika Society has achieved good results in handling the relief work for the Shanghai war. Now, although the society has ended all relief work for the war, in view of the fact that the districts affected by the war are full of devastation, and post-war rehabilitation and relief are urgent, the society's Beijing General Office has allocated 18,000 yuan for post-war rehabilitation and relief, with 10,000 yuan handed over to the society's Beijing Office to handle rehabilitation and relief in Nanxiang, Liuhe, west (including Yanglinkou Jiading Jiwangmiao), Taicang and other places, and 8,000 yuan allocated to the Shanghai General Office to handle the disaster areas of Baoshan, Wusong, Liuhe, Jiangwan, Miaohang, Dachang, Zhabei, Nanxiang, Zhenru and other places. The Shanghai General Office also allocated 6,000 yuan for rehabilitation, totaling 14,000 yuan, to distribute to the disaster areas. It has now appointed investigators to start district-by-district investigations and implement rehabilitation. Also, it is reported that after our side took over the Huangdu-Nanxiang area, many of the buried bodies were dragged by dogs, scattered all over the ground, which was unbearable to see. As the weather gradually heats up, the stench is suffocating, which is detrimental to hygiene. The 19th Route Army Transportation Department sent a telegram to the East Asia Relief Team of the society, requesting that a burial team be sent to work immediately. After receiving the telegram, Captain Cao immediately sent the director of the burial team, along with his staff, carrying tools, to start from Suzhou and is now carrying out burials in Nanxiang and other places.</p>

<p>The Shanghai North China Merchant Public Bus Company has always been very developed in its daily business. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the company was right in the middle of the incident. Many vehicles were destroyed, and the losses were not small. Recently, the company, in order to quickly seek to restore traffic, has been speeding up the repair of all vehicles, and is scheduled to start operating on June 1st. However, the three lines of buses used to run from the North Station to Zhenru, passing through Qiujiang Road, Jiaotong Road and other places. It is heard that the route will be changed, passing through the railway station and other places to Zhenru. The company has submitted it to the Public Utility Bureau for instructions, and it can be implemented as soon as it is approved.</p>

<p>New Drug Association Sends Letter to Lawyer Wu</p>
<p>The New Drug Association sent a letter to lawyer Wu Linkun, saying that the owner of Tongchunfang, Huamao Real Estate Company, the landlord of the British-owned Bianerde Foreign Firm, has not only refused to reduce the rent for the tenants, but also hired your lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Special Region Local Court for rent arrears. The housing is located in the center of the concession and is not affected by the war at all. The businesses operated by the defendants are mostly hotels, restaurants, pharmacies, etc., which have tripled their profits during the war. This is very strange. After the January 28th Incident, all the shops in the concession, out of patriotic enthusiasm, went on strike to resist the enemy. It was not until April 1st that they reluctantly resumed business. The members of our association, as reported, are also among the defendants. The wholesale of foreign goods is the main business, and the retail business is the secondary business. After the incident, the national transportation was blocked, the wholesale of foreign goods was completely cut off, and the retail business only sold one or two yuan a day, which was not enough to pay for the food of the staff. After the resumption of business, the market was depressed, and the business also fell sharply, and the economic hardship was very different from the past. It is ridiculous to say that they have tripled their profits. The various associations in the city are concerned about this, so the Shanghai Citizens' Rent Reduction and Exemption Movement Committee has submitted the zoning rent reduction measures to the party and government agencies, requesting that they be promulgated by order. The municipal government is still considering the matter and should wait patiently for a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e144">National Lawyers Association Protests Against Opium Monopoly in Various Provinces <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of opium monopoly in various provinces, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association and various people's organizations have risen up to protest. Supervisory Committee Member Gao Youtang has also filed an impeachment against Liu Ruiheng, chairman of the Anti-Smoking Committee, but the authorities have other intentions and have not investigated it, resulting in the spread of the opium disaster and its increasing severity. The Propaganda Department of the National Lawyers Association also issued a statement yesterday, expressing its opposition. It is recorded as follows: "The tide of opium monopoly has occurred several times before and after. Now, the adulterous husband is listening to our ears, and we hear about opium monopoly again. At this time, there are sores everywhere, and there are many difficulties. The central region has repeatedly seen floods, and the north and south have seen each other's troops. The local authorities have come up with this loyal heart to implement opium monopoly, which will inevitably make the survivors who are spared from the floods and true disasters all die under the fire of opium pipes. Reversing the trend of history, there is nothing more than this. It is harmful to nature and reason, and it is even more so. Recently, various provinces have carried out public sales, and the rain is rushing wildly, walking with high heads and wide steps, regardless of忌. In fact, the Central Anti-Smoking Bureau secretly approves and supports them, teaches them the tricks, and directs their advance and retreat. Therefore, the central region remains the same, and Fujian and Anhui take the lead. North China followed suit, and the southeast worked hard to brew. The black terror has come to people, and the Chinese national soul will be widely invited back. In ancient times, there was a harsh government that ate people by cart, and now there is a tragic story of poisoning and slaughtering people. This kind of tragedy is actually seen in this 20th century civilized world, in the era of high-pitched democracy and humanism. Is it not a strange thing? This kind of harsh government is not seen in the uncivilized nations of South Africa and North Australia, but in the Chinese nation, which has always been known as the descendant of Xuanyuan and has enjoyed a brilliant and glorious history of more than 4,000 years. It is even more shocking to hear. It is a joke to the world, and it leaves a stain on the past. Who does not have the same deep feeling of dying together? The crimes of opium smoking and the prohibition of transport, sale, and smoking are all clearly recorded in the criminal law, and the single anti-smoking law has also been promulgated and implemented by the Legislative Yuan of the National Government. The prohibitions are all there, but the anti-smoking authorities are blinded by greed and change their minds, implementing opium monopoly, destroying the criminal law, and creating various pretexts. Therefore, the Special Tax Office, the Anti-Smoking Investigation Office, and the Narcotic Drug Management Agency are all波诡, and people are dazzled by them. Now, opium monopoly in various provinces is also seen in practice, which shows that the authorities have hidden evil intentions and have been planning it for a long time. They have been thinking about it day and night, promoting traitors and villains and leading them as their followers. Therefore, the promoters of opium monopoly, Wu Liande and the organizers Li Jihong, have been repeatedly requested by the public from all walks of life to be dealt with according to law, but the government has always tolerated them. Even Liu Ruiheng, the current chairman of the Anti-Smoking Committee who怂恿 public sales, has been impeached twice by the Supervisory Yuan in the past two years, but the government has also ignored it, and its prestige has been swept away, and the law has been destroyed. Our association has always taken promoting the rule of law and protecting human rights as its responsibilities. We will definitely unite with the public and various organizations to oppose this act of greed for wealth and disregard for the law. We swear to resolutely oppose the disguised opium monopoly system that strips the people's fat and凌國本, and strive for it according to the main purpose of our association's protection of rights. We hope that people from all walks of life will be vigilant and take the warning of the nest, make a picture of披髮, and urgently rise up to resist, and all will respond, so that the evil system of disguised opium monopoly will not exist in our country, destroy our home, and destroy our blood. Our association sincerely策駘, and is willing to be the backing of the people of the country. This is the statement of the Propaganda Department of the National Lawyers Association.</p>

<p>Opposing Landlords' Deadline for Eviction</p>
<p>The houses of Hua'anfang on North Zhejiang Road and Huaxing Road are the property of Chen Bing, who is actually run by Xiangzang Foreign Company. After the January 28th war, the house was near the North Station. Because the road belonged to the concession, it was surrounded by railway networks. When the tenants were in trouble, most of them fled for their lives, and the tenants' belongings were all stolen by traitors and vagrants. Therefore, the losses suffered by the tenants in the neighborhood were even greater than those in other places. After the ceasefire, the landlord published a notice in the newspaper on April 16, giving the tenants a deadline to move back. The shops and residents were planning to resume business. Before a month had passed, the tenement office suddenly notified the tenants, on the pretext of renovation, to vacate the premises by the end of the month, and forcibly built bamboo fences to force them to move. The residents of the neighborhood, in view of the landlord's unreasonable persecution, specially sent representatives from the Tenants' Association to petition the Social Bureau yesterday, and also sent a letter requesting rent reduction and assistance.</p>

<p>Jiang Shoubao Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</p>
<p>Jiang Shoubao, a 13-year-old Wuxi girl living at No. 629 East Tangjia Lane, had a quarrel with a neighbor girl, Qian Amao, 14 years old, at about 7 pm on the 25th of this month. After the quarrel, she secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide that night. After her mother noticed, she immediately reported it to the relevant Huishi Police Station and ordered detectives to investigate. The girl was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but she died of poisoning the next day. The body was taken to the Xiyanshi Institute on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was requested to appoint Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and secretary Wang Zuyi, to go to the institute to investigate the body. Ascending the seat of office, according to Qian Amao's confession, "I was selling newspapers in the lane that day, and Jiang was scolding me behind my back. Later, I also scolded him back a few times, and there was no other accident." According to Jiang Li's complaint, "The deceased is my daughter, and her husband died early. At about 6 pm the night before, I went to Tongfu Road for something. Unexpectedly, when I returned home, I saw that the girl's face was very different, and she told me that she had swallowed opium." The reason was because she had a quarrel with Qian Amao, and Qian's parents beat my daughter and burned her neck with cigarette butts. Neighbors and my brother all witnessed it at that time. If she had not been beaten, she would not have committed suicide." Mr. Guo declared that the deceased was indeed poisoned to death by swallowing opium before her death. The body was handed over to the mother of the corpse, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Wang Yuanlong Sues Zhang Shichuan <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Both Parties Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>The famous director Wang Yuanlong, who is currently the leading actor in the Longma Film Company, signed a contract with Zhang Shichuan, the manager of the Star Film Company, in August last year to shoot the film "Water Margin". Later, because the film was banned by the authorities, Zhang sued Wang in the First Special District Court for civil reasons for owing money. At that time, the newspapers also published this matter. However, after Wang Yuanlong was sued, he believed that Zhang's publicity in the newspapers had completely destroyed his reputation, causing him great losses for almost a year. Therefore, he also hired lawyer Ge Cheng to sue Zhang Shichuan in the Special Court for defamation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Fu Lin opened a court to hear the case. The defendant Zhang Shichuan did not arrive, and lawyer Zhan Jifeng was appointed to appear in court as his agent. He also filed a counterclaim for false accusation, that is, according to the complaint of the plaintiff Wang Yuanlong, the above situation was true and that he did not owe Zhang's money. Therefore, the lawsuit was also won at that time, but Zhang's publicity in the newspapers damaged my reputation, causing me great losses. I should ask to investigate. Then lawyer Zhan Jifeng said that this case was actually caused by the plaintiff making waves out of nothing, filing a lawsuit, and wanting the defendant to be punished criminally. He also stated the circumstances of the civil litigation and submitted the previous judgments for filing, and filed a counterclaim, falsely accusing him of requesting to be punished according to the law. At the end of the debate by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Fu ruled in court that Wang Yuanlong and Zhang Shichuan were both not guilty. Wang Yuanlong's ancillary civil litigation was transferred to the civil court for trial.</p>

<p>The Car Returned Intact</p>
<p>The Purpose of the Theft Remains Unknown</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:25 PM, a hurried customer, appearing to be a local youth, about thirty years old, wearing a gray jacket and a felt hat, entered the Asia Automobile Company at 107 Avenue Dubail in the French Concession. Claiming to be named Wang, he asked the company accountant the hourly rental rate. The accountant replied that the minimum price was three silver dollars per hour. The hurried customer immediately paid three dollars, saying he needed to go to Longhua. The chauffeur, Zhao Alin from Yangzhou, was assigned a Shunfeng sedan with a French Concession license plate number 12192 (Shanghai City 41040). When the car reached the entrance of Lane Sande on Avenue Saepe, the youth suddenly ordered the car to stop and called out to a person standing at the lane entrance wearing a black raincoat. The two then sat side by side, and the car drove south. After reaching Xujiahui Road and crossing the Jinguiji Bridge, it arrived at Xietu Road. At that time, the youth ordered the car to drive west. When it reached about a hundred paces west of Mingde School, the youth again ordered the car to stop. The two jumped out of the car together, forced the chauffeur out of the car, and forbade him from making any noise, saying they needed to borrow the car for a while and would return it shortly. The youth then got back into the car and drove off at lightning speed. The person in the raincoat watched over the chauffeur. About half an hour later, the person in the raincoat told the chauffeur in a low voice that the car was parked on Zhongshan Road and that he could go and get it. After saying this, he left. The chauffeur then walked west to Zhongshan Road, but could not find the car anywhere. He then went to the Longhua Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau to report the incident. At that time, a chauffeur from the Headquarters who was passing by Jinguiji Bridge on official business saw the car that had been stolen and told Zhao Alin. When Zhao rushed to Jinguiji Road, he indeed saw the car parked by the roadside. Everything in the car was intact. He immediately drove the car back, which was already after 8:00 PM. However, the true purpose of the hurried customer stealing the car remains unknown.</p>

<p>Zhang Bin, also known as Zhang Yulin and Zhang Zhenting, from Xuzhou, residing at 285 Yuqing Lane, Avenue Messimy in the French Concession, along with accomplices Song Ziping (from Anhui) and Peng Yifu (also known as Peng Jifu, from Jiangxi), claimed to have recruited thousands of volunteer soldiers in Henan and needed funds for their deployment. In Shanghai, they solicited a large sum of over 20,000 yuan from Gu Zilin, Zhang Yintang, and seven others who owned inns, etc. Fearing that Gu and the others would see through the deception, they lured them to Henan, causing them to be detained by the provincial government and nearly suffering an unjust fate. Later, after various public organizations in Shanghai sent telegrams to prove their identities, they were released and returned to Shanghai yesterday. They went to Yuqing Lane in the French Concession to find Zhang to negotiate, but Zhang had already fled without a trace. They have now reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau and various police stations in both the Chinese and French Concessions, requesting that they be put on the wanted list and severely punished.</p>

Such a perfect marriage must have been predestined in a previous life. Spring is as deep as the sea, hundreds of flowers bloom, mandarin ducks pledge their lives together. May the flowers be beautiful, the moon be full, and the people live long, to watch the paired shadows forever."</p>

Other performers, such as Zhang's younger sister-in-law, Miss Mali from the United States singing Peking opera, also received much applause. Today is the last day. Zhang will perform his life's masterpieces to the fullest as a farewell commemoration. Miss Mali will change her performance to "June Snow." Other programs will also be more substantial than in the past two days. The additional screening of the silent film "Divorce Den" requires one hour, so those who reserve seats can see the entirety of Zhang's technique, even if they arrive half an hour late.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Yixin Educational Supplies Company's Wax Paper Sells Well <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that Yixin Educational Supplies Company, located on Fuzhou Road in Shanghai, has been manufacturing domestic wax paper for ten years. Although its products occupy an important position among domestic goods, the supply is insufficient to meet the demand. At this time of post-war agreement and commercial revival, in order to prevent the activity of enemy wax paper, the company has exclusively managed wax paper produced by the Austrian Golle factory as a supplement. Its quality is excellent, its effect is particularly long-lasting, and it is superior to enemy wax paper, which is as expected. As a result, both retail and wholesale sales are so busy that they cannot keep up. It is evident that the Chinese people have an urgent need for mimeograph wax paper. It is also learned that in one month, large shipments of the wax paper will arrive one after another, and in six months, all of the manufacturing machinery can be shipped to Shanghai to manufacture more domestic wax paper using domestic raw materials.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 28th. The Ministry of Education has formulated provisional regulations for graduation entrance examinations for primary and secondary school students and has issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities. If any province, city, or district has special circumstances that prevent it from holding a secondary school entrance examination, it must first submit a report to the Ministry for approval and record. If any county or city primary school cannot hold an entrance examination, the local educational administrative organs should describe the local situation and submit it to the responsible Education Department for review and record.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 28th. According to a report from the Jiangxi Education Department, universities hold entrance examinations for new students in early July each year, while middle schools in various provinces often hastily end the courses and hold graduation examinations in advance in order to accommodate students applying for further education. However, even with this, the time is too short and transportation is difficult, and many students traveling from afar often arrive late. Therefore, they requested that all universities and educational institutions in the country be notified to postpone the entrance examination periods appropriately starting from the next academic year. The Ministry has now issued a circular to all schools to consider and implement this.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Some Changes to the Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Primary School <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Normal Schools Independently Implement Attached Primary Schools to Become Experimental Primary Schools with Exclusive Responsibility for Experimentation</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department has decided to implement an independent system for normal schools and has designated Zhenjiang Middle School and eight other schools to specialize in normal school education in the future. Starting next year, they will no longer enroll general education students. The experimental primary schools originally attached to these schools will naturally be changed to attached primary schools for normal school students to practice and research effective teaching methods for local primary schools to emulate. The experimental primary schools attached to middle schools that have not been changed to normal schools will still be called experimental primary schools, with the exclusive responsibility for experimenting with new teaching methods, and will gradually enrich their content in order to complete the above mission. However, before all the normal school students originally in the middle schools have graduated, the names of the primary schools may be changed, but the original tasks will not be changed much. This matter has been communicated to the middle schools and experimental primary schools for information. The Education Department's instructions are extracted below:</p>
<p>In order to emphasize normal school education, cultivate excellent teachers, and achieve the goal of universal compulsory education, this Department has decided to adopt an independent system for normal schools. Starting in 1932, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Taicang, Rugao, Huaiyin, and Donghai Middle Schools, as well as Suzhou and Xuzhou Girls' Middle Schools, will be designated to establish normal school departments and will not enroll general education students. All other provincial middle schools will no longer enroll normal school students. It has been communicated to all schools to comply. The experimental primary schools currently in the provincial middle schools are mostly reorganized from the primary schools attached to the former normal schools. At that time, the organizational changes were made because of the emphasis on experimental work. However, because the experimental work was just starting and the plans were complicated, the original task of normal school students' practice was sometimes not fully considered, resulting in the feeling that the most recent graduating normal school students lacked teaching experience. Now that the independent normal schools have been restored, the organization of the attached primary schools should be changed accordingly to suit the actual situation.</p>
<p>It is now decided that starting in 1932, the experimental primary schools attached to the middle schools designated to specialize in normal school education, including Zhenjiang Middle School Experimental Primary School, Wuxi Middle School Experimental Primary School, Taicang Middle School Experimental Primary School, Huaiyin Middle School Experimental Primary School, Donghai Middle School Experimental Primary School, Suzhou Girls' Middle School Experimental Primary School, and Xuzhou Girls' Middle School Experimental Primary School, should all uniformly cancel the experimental designation. Together with the primary school department of Rugao Middle School, they will all be renamed "Attached Primary School of [Middle School Name]," with special emphasis on the teaching practice of normal school students. They will also research and improve effective teaching methods for local primary schools to emulate. The remaining South Middle School Experimental Primary School, South Girls' Middle School Experimental Primary School, Suzhou Middle School Experimental Primary School, Tongzhou Middle School Experimental Primary School, Xuzhou Middle School Experimental Primary School, Yangzhou Middle School Experimental Primary School, and Songjiang Girls' Middle School Experimental Primary School will still use the old experimental name and will be solely responsible for experimenting with temporary education methods. The results of the research will be shared with the attached primary schools to jointly improve local primary schools and gradually enrich their content in order to complete the above mission. Before all the normal school students in these middle schools have graduated, the original teaching practice should still be carried out as before, and guidance should be strengthened. The organizational regulations for attached primary schools will be drafted and promulgated separately, and the organizational regulations for experimental primary schools should be amended and promulgated separately. This order is hereby issued to the principals of the schools for their information. This order.</p>

<p>News from the Pudong Middle School Board of Directors: Pudong Middle School has been closed for one semester since the January 28th Shanghai Incident due to the dangerous location, obstructed transportation, and the fact that most of the students are from Guangdong and Sichuan, who have all returned home to transfer to nearby schools or study at other schools. The school board of directors immediately resolved to close the school for one semester. The principal formally notified the students' parents and reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau for record. Now that Shanghai has been restored, the school board of directors is properly planning a thorough reorganization and preparing to open the school early next semester and provide all kinds of assistance to students' studies. The news reported yesterday that the teachers and students of the school jointly formed a school affairs maintenance committee and that the school would open on June 1st is completely rumored and not factual.</p>

<p>Ten</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang! Please sit in my temple room for a while. I'll talk to you when I've finished ringing the bell."</p>
<p>With that, I went to ring my dawn bell. As I walked, I thought, this bearded man has given me a difficult problem. I must refuse him. But he has some influence in the countryside. He is more than capable of ruining something but is not enough to fix it, I must be careful. Although I must refuse him, I must not offend him. It's never a good thing for enemies to meet. The fact that I’m waking him up from his opium den with the bell is already more than enough to bear. Now I'm promoting the establishment of a school, and he wants to be a teacher. It's so coincidental that it's truly laughable and annoying. But what to do? ... I rang the bell and walked into the room, only to find Zhang the Bearded Man lying on my bed snoring. Is this the effect of the dawn bell? Does he have to fall asleep when he hears my dawn bell? Who knows? Okay, let him sleep, I'll wake him up when I have a solution.</p>
<p>I have it! This school should be run by all the people in the village. Who can act alone? Who can privately pass it down? Good, let's do that. Each family will send a representative to the temple to discuss it together. The more I think about it, the more I feel this is the fairest method. I can't think of anything better. So I walked through the village, greeting each family and saying, "Please send one representative from each family to the temple to discuss opening a school and hiring a teacher. Come when you hear my bell ring." ... The children happily said, "A school is opening ... we'll have a school to go to ..."</p>
<p>After greeting everyone, I returned to the temple to arrange everything. How will these people hold a meeting? Since the creation of the world, this village has never held a formal meeting. I have no such experience either. This founding meeting is so important, can we just hold it casually? That's right, I have a book on meeting rules in my drawer. Why don't I take it out and take a look? This book was given to me by a young tourist. Now this book has become our only guide. I thought that I could flip through it a few times, get a general idea, and then start ringing the bell. In reality, it wasn't that easy. I was too hasty in this matter, like digging a well when I was thirsty. But I thought that digging a well when I was thirsty was still trying to find a solution through my own efforts, which was better than standing there waiting for it to rain. I spent more than two hours reading to figure out the important secrets of holding a meeting. Then I boldly went to ring the bell to convene the founding meeting.</p>
<p>The school's work is being carried out with professors and students jointly forming a school affairs design committee. This spirit of cooperation is proposing fundamental plans to seek the development of school affairs. The school's new charter will soon be printed, and the improvements in organization and education will be determined in the new charter.</p>
<p>In the past ten days, students at the school have been striving to demonstrate a spirit of unity, and various societies have been fully established. There are four organizations: the Political Science Society, the Educational Society, the Science Society, and the Commerce Society. The Political Science Society has initiated a joint effort by all the societies to conduct research and investigation on various aspects after the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. It is planned to compile the results of the research and investigation into a series of books or special publications for contribution.</p>

<p>A Conversation with Lin Baohua</p>
<p>Our country’s tennis star, Qiu Feihai, after experiencing numerous battles in Shanghai last year, achieved great success and was highly praised. Despite losing to Canadian Davis Cup player Defoe and Japan's Hyosaku Tabaru, he eventually defeated Lin Baohua three to one, avenging his defeat of the previous year. Therefore, those who talk about tennis now will say that Xing Feihai is better than Lin Baohua. Since the end of last year's tennis season, Qiu returned to his hometown of Singapore. Whether he will return to Shanghai has attracted the attention of the tennis community and those who appreciate Qiu's skills. This reporter met Lin Baohua yesterday to inquire about Qiu's return to Shanghai. According to Lin, Singapore's tennis competitions are far less grand than those in Shanghai, so Qiu decided to make a comeback. The date is around mid-June. The various competitions of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club have been entrusted to me (Lin himself) to register. Furthermore, Lin Wangsu, who defeated Qiu Feihai three to two last year, will also come with Qiu. If this becomes a reality, this year's tennis season will be no less lively than last year. Ladies and gentlemen in Shanghai who are passionate about tennis, as well as those who appreciate the skills of Lin (Wangsu), Qiu (Feihai), and Lin (Baohua), will undoubtedly eagerly await.</p>

Later, there was a slight fluctuation around 725 taels, indicating a stable exchange rate. It seemed weak at noon, but the exchange rate tightened slightly in the afternoon, and banks made some purchases, so the gold price turned stronger. However, there were not many transactions from all parties. The recent transaction volume is estimated to be less than 19,000 taels. The detailed situation of the whole day is recorded below.</p>

HSBC sold June American gold to Zhengjin at 6875, and the price plummeted by more than two taels, until it reached 24 taels at 11:00. Then, due to banks absorbing August 31.0625 yuan and September 1875 yuan, it increased to 25 taels and two qian in just ten minutes. However, Yifeng, Yongyuan, and Kangxiang, etc., continued to sell, and the US dollar seemed strong, so it declined by more than one tael.

The closing price at 4:30 was 26 taels and four qian, an increase of three taels and four qian compared to the previous day. The situation was exactly the opposite of the previous day.

<p>Market Overview Yesterday, in the Japanese street silver and money industry, there were many transactions in the morning and afternoon markets due to the majority of securities being sold for delivery. However, the morning market still had bank purchases to support it, and the silver dollar price did not change much. The afternoon market saw stagnation in purchases and a strong selling atmosphere, making it difficult for prices to hold steady. As the trend became increasingly weak, it was always difficult to expect a firm price. Since the silver base was in the middle of the general closing period, there was no hope of rising either.

<p>The decline in the New York stock market in the past few days only slightly stopped on Thursday. At the beginning of the opening, the atmosphere was the same as the previous day. Various stocks fell repeatedly. Later, due to Washington's decision to levy a sales tax on manufactured goods, people were hopeful, so the stocks rose uniformly, and the closing price was slightly higher than the previous day. Whether there will be continued progress in the future depends on how the tax system progresses. However, it is expected that stock prices will slightly trend upward during the day. The Dow Jones daily guidance is attached as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market was weak in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the trend was abnormally scattered and there was no sign of recovery. People's hearts were bleak, and transactions of futures yarn were still scarce. It was still difficult to resume business hours, so the range of market fluctuations was between one or two taels, and the elasticity was getting weaker. Under these circumstances, it was difficult for the market to prosper for a while. The actual needs in the market were also mediocre, and each gang had no active purchasing power. The Sichuan gang has now announced that it has stopped buying. In short, the current market is still in a stagnant state.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Man-Marked Market Is Extremely Idle <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The man-marked market opened in the early market, and foreign cotton fell again. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and each month fell by five or six qian. In the afternoon, there was a part of scalping, and the market rebounded by 1, 2, and 5 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was only 2,950 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 300 bales, Tongyu 300 bales, Gengfeng 450 bales, and Yida 250 bales. Renfeng bought 450 bales, Shenji 450 bales, Yiyu 150 bales, Jifeng 250 bales, and Tongxing 150 bales. The closing prices are listed as follows:</p>

<p>The current yarn business was less than yesterday. The Guangdong gang bought the most, totaling 335 bales. In addition, Yunnan entered 702 bales, the inland entered 69 bales, Shantou 70 bales, Ningbo entered 27 bales, and Zhenjiang entered 15 bales, totaling 1,300 bales. The market conditions were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Cotton Market Is Ordinary <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat and tired, and the market atmosphere was still peaceful, but the situation of American cotton was relatively soft and gold prices were calm. In fact, most outsiders intended to go long because the bottom had dried up and the weather was too cloudy, and the water in Hankou was gradually increasing. However, based on actual measurements, there was no good possibility, the needs of each factory were quiet, and foreign cotton's calculated silver plate was cheap, so there was no prospect of great development in the current cotton business.</p>
<p>Zheng Marked Has No Major Changes. The Zheng Marked opened in the early market, and the market was slightly soft due to the weakness of American cotton. Each month fell by five fen to one qian. The market was particularly strong when the afternoon market closed, and each month rose by five fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 10,200 dan. It was found that Yichang sold 1,400 dan, Yuanda 900 dan, Yongda 300 dan, Shenji 400 dan, Zhenda 400 dan, and Tongfu 200 dan. Jifeng bought 400 dan, Taixing 200 dan, Yuchang 300 dan, Yifeng 800 dan, Changhe 700 dan, and Yongchang 400 dan. The closing prices are listed as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was tired at first due to bad news from Liverpool, and bulls closed their positions. Later, it rebounded due to some short covering.

<h3 id="e200">Important News on Domestic New Cotton Production <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Recently, letters have been received from cotton-producing provinces and regions, covering the overall situation of cotton production. Excerpts are as follows: Hubei (Letter of the 14th): Due to a severe shortage of seeds and rampant bandits in the countryside, farmers have no way to cultivate the land. Due to last year's flood, farmers have no power to cultivate the land, and this year's production will inevitably be reduced. It has been raining for more than half a month in Hubei Province, and cotton production has been even more damaged.</p>
<p>Shanxi (Letter of the 15th): The situation of cotton production this year is still unlikely to be a bumper harvest. Due to the lack of rain this spring, each county did not receive three or four inches of rain until the 5th of this month. However, the sowing period seems to be slightly late.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Early Silkworm Cocoons Seen New, Late Silkworms Only Three Sleeps <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The spring silkworms in the four villages of Wuxi have a difference of about two weeks between the early and late silkworm seasons. The early silkworms have suffered damage due to the weather, and 60% to 70% have been abandoned. Early silkworm cocoons have been seen new. However, after the silkworms were on the racks, due to thunderstorms and extreme cold, the silkworm ants did not spin enough silk, and the silkworms were thin and inferior. Very few cocoons were opened for weighing. This kind of inferior cocoon was refused and not accepted. Slightly superior cocoons originally opened at only 15 or 16 yuan, but now it is only 20 yuan. The late silkworms, which are being raised by the silkworm households, only have three sleeps. The climate is unevenly warm and cold, and the development is not smooth. However, it is slightly better than the early silkworm flood. The price of leaves is currently sold at 1 yuan and 45 corners.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market remained stagnant and lifeless. It was found that New York raw silk prices continued to decline, and factory managers and others also became weary. Various silk mills are focusing on rayon and Japanese silk as raw materials, causing the market to weaken to an extreme. No one inquired about Chinese silk. Both spot and futures silk in Shanghai remained suspended, indicating the silk market has fallen into dire straits.</p>
<h3 id="e203">High Prices and Flourishing Trade for New Tea in Wuyuan <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>New tea from Wuyuan has been opening for sale in large quantities since the day before yesterday. Tea farmers have sold almost a third of their tea reserves. Today (the 20th), Dragon Isle tea, known for its superior quality among northern Wuyuan tea leaves, was opened for sale by Cantonese merchants, priced at 80 yuan. Qinghua Zhangcun tea was priced at 70 yuan, Xikeng tea at 74 yuan, Nanxiang Kaoshui tea at 48 yuan, and Yaocun Duan tea at 51 yuan. The market momentum continues to rise. However, high-grade tea from various villages above Dayuan and Fengshan in the eighth district is not yet being traded in large quantities, as harvesting and processing are not fully completed. Various shops in Sikou and Zhangcun are rushing to produce “core-extracted” tea and have scheduled sorting to begin tomorrow. According to recent investigations, more than ten new shops have been added in Wubei Yanchuan, Wangcun, Gao'an, and Dragon, among other places. Among them, Gao'an Qian Jixiang is a Shanghai Cantonese shop that relocated to Wuyuan this year due to the destruction of its warehouse in Zhabei.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Qimen Black Tea Third Batch Approaching Completion <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The various batches of Qimen black tea, except for the first and second batches that have been successively shipped to Shanghai, the third batch will soon be fully stacked within days. By the end of this month, all batches are expected to be completed. According to statistics from Qimen tea merchants, the amount of tea purchased by various shops this year is 30-40% less than in previous years, with each shop buying no more than 300 boxes. This is because there was a lot of rain during the picking season, resulting in weak production. Later, when the weather cleared, the tea leaves were already old and the plants were no longer tender. The final mountain price also fell to 30 yuan. Economically sound shops are still processing floral-scented tea. Currently, various shops are hoping that the first and second batches will be sold profitably, and they will need to continue processing subsidiary batches when new tea emerges.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Qimen Tea Trade Still Thriving <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market saw active trading in Qimen, Fuliang, and other types of black tea. Over 3,300 boxes were traded throughout the market. Top prices remained at 200 taels, and the situation has become more stable than before. However, the green tea market remains sluggish. There were no transactions for high-grade Zhenmei tea. Foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson, Wing On, and Tong Fu have purchased over 600 boxes of native Zhenmei and Zhenmei needles, but prices are consistently declining. About twenty boxes of Gongxi tea from Donglu, Wuyuan, arrived yesterday. It is reported that white-label merchants are offering prices that are 10-20 taels lower than before. Chinese tea merchants are unwilling to sell due to high costs, and no new prices have been established yet.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Dexing Tea Difficult to Sell Due to Banditry <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>This year's Dexing new tea is of tender and high-quality. Due to financial constraints, mountain farmers, even though their residences have been occupied by bandits, are seizing the opportunity to return home to harvest and process new tea. Because they cannot store the tea at home, they are willing to sell it cheaply. Top and middle-grade tea is only selling for 20 to 19 yuan per dan (unit of weight). Common tea merchants, enticed by the prospect of high profits, are braving danger to travel to the seventh, eighth, and ninth districts to purchase tea. Tea purchased in Dexing can be sold for 50 to 60 yuan per dan in Wuyuan, resulting in a profit of 30 to 40 yuan per dan. Recently, tea merchants from Sikou and Changtan in Wuyuan went to the Xinjian area to purchase tea but were discovered by communist bandits. One tea merchant from Sikou was captured, and the rest abandoned their tea and fled. As a result, merchants who were going to Dexing to purchase tea are all deterred and dare not consider it anymore.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Rice Market Sales Slow After a Peak <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai South rice market received approximately 30 boats from the western routes. The inventory at local shops was slightly higher. Due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival and financial pressure, transactions were sluggish. Changzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, and other varieties of northern Jiangsu rice were each down by one jiao. Qingjiao, Sisong, and Bo rice also followed, decreasing by a few fen. The sale of Tongbian Yinyuan rice was mediocre, and the momentum was also weakening. Foreign, Du, and Ke varieties were scarce, resulting in a hard increase of one jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, twenty-seven or eight boats arrived in the North City from various gangs. The market opened in the morning with a disheartening and lackluster atmosphere. Prices for Changzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, and other types of white rice were fixed in the morning market. By the afternoon, prices had dropped by one jiao each. There was not much early Bo rice available, so the price remained the same as the previous market. Foreign Lu Tip rice was neither sought after nor despised. Glutinous rice was being purchased by wine sellers, causing tightness in the market. There was a lack of Yinyuan rice, resulting in no market for it. In both the front and back markets, the total amount of grain unloaded from boats was approximately 3,400 shi (unit of volume).</p>
<p>Min Dang Rice Routes</p>
<h3 id="e208">Gradually Trending Upward <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rain made people hopeful for the rice market, and spot prices rose consistently. Although there was a large inventory of Xiaojiao rice, sales were also strong. Over 12,000 bags were offered in the market, with brokers directly allocating over 10,000 bags to factories. Prices still rose by several fen. There was a shortage of Min Dang rice, but demand in the market was good, leading to high demand for the route's rice. 400 bags were offered, priced at 11.4 yuan, an increase of over two jiao compared to the previous day. The prices of other types of rice also rose by several fen. However, futures were continuously being sold off by foreign firms, keeping the market flat. Xiaojiao rice was sold for 10.093 yuan and 10.08 yuan, then at 10.069 yuan. Old Xiaojiao rice was sold for 10.054 yuan. 1,000 bags of red Xiaojiao rice for delivery in three or four days were sold for 10 yuan. Min Dang rice for delivery in four weeks was sold for 5.25 taels per 600 tons. Xiaojiao rice for May delivery was sold for 5 taels per 200 tons. In new transactions, a company from Saigon sold 1,250 tons for July delivery, including 1,000 tons of Yuanli rice from Gongli at 5.5 taels and 250 tons of Changli rice from Gongli at 5.45 taels, all purchased by the street. The street also purchased 250 bags of Jiangxi Yuan rice, priced between 14.5 yuan and 14.48 yuan.</p>
<p>Cold Weather Affects New Wheat</p>
<h3 id="e209">Spot Flour Slightly Active <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market showed slight activity. Due to the cold and rainy weather, the new wheat harvest has been somewhat affected. As it is currently the harvest season, if the weather does not clear, there will inevitably be an impact on the market value of flour and wheat. As a result, people seem to be firm in their expectations. Bingchuan flour was offered at 2.035 taels, then 2.025 taels. Approximately 6,000 bags were sold in the market. Honglanche flour was not traded and is expected to be available during the new wheat season.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3 id="e210">Piece Goods Market Weakens Again <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The local cotton cloth market has become sluggish again. As the end of the accounting period approaches, credit has become tight. Additionally, continuous rainy weather has caused the Yangtze River to rise significantly, causing people to become more cautious. Demand is not as strong as it was in previous days. Yesterday's prices fell across the board. Jin Sanda Bleached Cloth, which had been holding firm for a long time, also dropped by a small amount. Although the Northern Gang made some purchases of 16-pound coarse cloth, there is a large amount of inventory in Shanghai, so prices are also gradually softening. The Yangtze River Gang is not active in 13-pound cloth, resulting in a strong downward trend. Although fine cloth is in season, the surreptitious activities of Japanese factories are making it difficult for prices to rise, and there is a tendency for them to decline further. Fine twill is even more silent. Shanghai floral cloth, Lun Chang floral cloth, and other items are also loosening across the board.</p>
<p>The market for Western piece goods is sluggish due to the rainy weather. After a period of activity, there have been considerable sales of lower-body striped Fuzhou silk. Yesterday, Yuanfang sold it for 3.15 qian, Xinji for 3.1 qian, Huaji for 3 qian, and Maigao for 2.8 qian. There was not much change in upper-body goods. This year's price for 7-thread raw Luo silk is about one tael lower than last year. Yingli Huaji only sold it for around 5.5 taels. There has been some recent activity in the domestic market for white Chong linen. Deji sold it for 2.05 qian, and Zhonghe double-width for 3.85 qian.</p>
<h3 id="e211">White Straight Tribute Cloth Sales Not Weak <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Recently, sales of white straight tribute cloth have been quite good. Heji's top grade is selling for 5.25 taels, second grade for 4.5 taels, and Haoshi for 4.05 taels. High-grade samples from Hongkou are being sold for 8-9 yuan per yard. Both local cloth shops and Western-style clothing stores have purchased it. Sales are more active than last week. It is reported that foreign firms are shipping more from their warehouses than in the previous week. There have been some transactions with guest gangs. Yesterday, Zhengchang white straight tribute cloth sold for 4.75 taels, and Wufeng striped white straight tribute cloth sold for 4.25 taels.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Ran Zhen'ao <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>You have already described the events involving the old man at the noodle shop. Now, I will tell you about Ran Zhen and He Yahu's killing of enemies, which is truly spirited. Let me first record Ran Zhen's story. After the Japanese army invaded our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, the ruling authorities raised the banner of non-resistance. The day of returning our rivers and mountains was nowhere in sight. However, the people of the Eastern Provinces suffered greatly under the Japanese army's poison, their homes turned to ruins, and the fields filled with white bones. Most of them had become people without a country or home. Therefore, volunteer armies rose up in various places, engaging in field battles with the Japanese army, shedding blood and throwing their heads, repeatedly defeating strong enemies. To this day, their momentum is quite strong, and the Japanese army has been unable to suppress them. Ran Zhen was from Niuzhuang and made a living driving a donkey cart. He had served in the military and was capable of fighting with a gun. Later, he deserted after offending his superiors. He was known for his chivalry in the neighborhoods, and was quite famous among the common people. The great bandit Lao Beifeng hated the brutality of the Japanese and rose up in rebellion, leading his followers in a night attack on Niuzhuang. The defending Japanese army responded hastily, and the volunteer army fought bravely, defeating the Japanese army. Ran Zhen arose in the night, wearing his clothes and gripping a wooden stick. He rushed to the Japanese army camp and hid in a dark corner. When a Japanese soldier retreated, he leaped forward and struck the soldier with his stick, causing him to fall to the ground. He then seized the soldier's gun and bullets and joined the volunteer army to fight, killing many Japanese soldiers. He also led the volunteer army in a fierce pursuit. This battle greatly frightened the Japanese army, and Lao Beifeng admired his courage and greatly appreciated him. Later, the Japanese army reinforced and counterattacked, and the volunteer army was forced to retreat due to strategic considerations. Ran Zhen also went with them. I do not know if this loyal and brave anti-Japanese warrior is still in the army today.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Shanghai Broadsword Teams <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>During the month-long bloody battle against the Japanese in Shanghai, the broadsword teams participated in the killing of enemies with unparalleled loyalty and courage. This is universally acknowledged. Here, I will describe the types of broadsword teams to fill in the gaps in this publication.</p>
<p>The broadsword team that uses only broadswords has no other weapons. During battle, they are positioned behind the infantry and cavalry. When close combat ensues, they leap to the front lines with a shout. Wherever their broadswords strike, they are invincible. Whenever the Japanese see the glint of the blade, their knees involuntarily bend or their feet turn backward. These men are either selected and trained from the soldiers or come from the general public, stirred by righteous indignation. They are all men of passion.</p>
<p>The broadsword team that also uses broadswords is essentially the infantry in the army. These men carry long guns and broadswords on their backs. During battle, they use their guns for long-range attacks. For close combat, they use the gun with the bayonet, but the bayonet is not as quick or effective as the broadsword. When Liu Zhi's First Division was stationed in Wuchang last month, I saw that the infantry in his army each carried a broadsword on their back.</p>
<p>The broadsword team with full weapons, in addition to the broadsword, also carries a Mauser pistol on their waist and hand grenades. Daggers are hidden in cloth bindings on both legs. During battle, if the situation is suitable for using a gun, the Mauser pistol fires like a string of pearls. If hand grenades are needed, they are thrown accurately. If the enemy's bullets come like rain and there is no way to avoid them, they wield their broadswords, and a cold light flashes. You cannot see the person, but you hear the bullets being deflected by the blade, making a clanging sound. The bullets cannot reach their bodies. Those skilled in using swords in Chinese martial arts wear white clothes. When they dance passionately, you only see the glint of swords and the chilling aura. If splashed with thick ink, it would all become a barrier of blades. When they finish dancing, their white clothes would not have a single stain. Perhaps the broadsword teams also possess this divine skill. They engage in bloody combat with the enemy, using their broadswords to chop and slash. Those who are struck are killed instantly. If their precious sword is unfortunately broken, they discard it and draw their daggers. They dance wildly with their short knives, and are also invincible. This broadsword team with full weapons is effective in long-range attacks and close combat. They are always victorious.</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Scenery of the Temple Fair <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Parrot</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Writings of the Old Capital (6)</p>
<p>The temple fair is almost a remnant of the ancient market system.</p>
<p>Every month on certain days, Funei Avenue is flooded with crowds of people, and many vendors add their stalls to the roadside. You can also hear the clamor of gongs and drums from the street performers, the solo performance of the Hu Jia by the street artists, the clear battles of the opium smokers, and many other hawking sounds. This continues for three days, and everyone knows that there is a temple fair at the White Pagoda Temple.</p>
<p>In Beijing, the temple fair is not limited to the White Pagoda Temple. I also know of one at Huguo Temple in the city and one at the hot springs outside the city. However, because I live near the White Pagoda Temple, I am more familiar with the situation there. In fact, all temple fairs are similar.</p>
<p>When the day of the temple fair arrives, the people nearby excitedly rush to attend, and there are also those who hire rickshaws from afar to visit. Especially the children nearby, on the day of the temple fair, they all smile and excitedly rush into the temple fair, because at that time they can see the big girls bathing in the peep show, watch the monkey show performed by Shandong people, listen to temporary Bangzi operas for three copper coins, and drink Dutch water for one copper coin per cup. In short, they believe that everything in the temple fair can attract their young minds and make them forget to return home. In the temple fair, in addition to things to watch, almost all daily necessities are sold. There are materials for making short shirts for young boys, fancy stationery for female students to write love letters, and jewelry for decorating women. However, the prices are cheaper than on the streets outside. Although this is the reason why ladies and young women who like to buy expensive foreign goods do not frequent the temple fair, the people below the middle class flock to it. Naturally, there are market prices here that suit their tastes, and the temple fair is almost reserved for these people below the middle class.</p>
<p>I spent ten copper coins in the temple fair to buy a pot of Zinnia, and I happily carried it back to my residence, because I wanted it to flourish day by day, so I served it every day like serving an old master, catching bugs and watering it a lot. However, in less than a week, the flowers drooped and the leaves withered. So, I looked forward to the next temple fair, so I could buy another pot.</p>

<p>The bugle horns startle and turn back the Shanghai tide, and a small army is proud of the insects and sand. Knowing that you were careless and lost the hard-to-attack city, you must regret sending your troops to raid from afar. Your great ambition was rewarded like Qin Bolang, and your prestige ultimately belonged to Han Piaoyao. Men lightly value life and death when serving their country, singing and crying, sharing drinks and writing great appeals.</p>
<p>From the beginning, divine courage relied on sincerity, and we still hear the sound of killing thieves in the dark sky. Sages and heroes have all died for a hundred years, and half of the heroes have no name for eternity. Who will turn the world's peaceful situation around? It should be evaluated in the Spring and Autumn Annals as a righteous war. Keep the good model of unwavering loyalty, and may a good name be bestowed upon the newborn nineteen (just one month after "January 28th," a grandson was born and named Nineteen).</p>

<p>For thirty-five days, the spirit of resistance filled the mountains and seas, shaking the past and shining on the present. Thinking of the lone army advancing alone at that time, invincible in their path. The brave warriors had already given their lives to fulfill their vows. What is there to fear from ten thousand deaths? They only sought to win a few points of popular sentiment, sweeping away the island country that swallows the East Sea.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years, the history of diplomacy has been one of holding back resentment and shame, stepping forward and then backward. Sighing that to this day, hundreds of ills are rampant, and things are getting worse and worse. The esteemed gentlemen are ultimately engaging in empty talk of revolution, with no plan. It is unbearable to retreat three times from the Japanese invaders and celebrate peace under the city walls.</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>"Sofu" and "Lafu" are both very peculiar terms in the East. "Sofu" originated in Japan, and "Lafu" is a product left over by our Chinese warlords. Yesterday, the newspaper reported that "Chen Jitang's troops were recruiting in the Guangsan Road area…" This is an ominous sign, and may be the beginning of another tragic scene of fratricide! During the twenty years of civil war, "Lafu" has left us with an incomprehensible sense of sorrow and trauma! The tighter the "Lafu" is pulled, the worse the situation becomes. Conversely, when fighting for the survival of the country and seeking the interests of the nation, such as the Northern Expedition fifteen years ago and the recent Battle of Shanghai, who would not be eager to participate in the war? How could there be a kidnapping-style "Lafu"? Therefore, the people fear "Lafu," which is to oppose civil war. Whoever forces "Lafu" is the demon of civil war!</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Tomb of Sima Yi <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>Sima Yi was a hero. I once visited his tomb and now recall what I saw to share with the readers.</p>
<p>It is located outside the north gate of the current capital (Luoyang), about three miles from the city and two miles from the east railway station. The terrain along the way is undulating and the roads are rugged. The tomb faces south and has a majestic appearance. There are no stone figures of civil or military officials or stone beasts at the mausoleum gate, nor are there tall, arched tomb trees. The rampant grass and desolate smoke create an extremely desolate scene. There is a stone stele in front of the tomb, engraved with the six characters "Emperor Xuan of Jin, Highland Mausoleum." The tomb site covers an area of more than ten acres and is about ten zhang (unit of length) tall. There is a hole in the center of the top that gradually narrows and is so deep that it cannot be seen. The elders of Luoyang say that a certain villager hated his treachery and sold his good head to a foreign country for the price of 100,000 gold yuan. If this is true, I am afraid that the stubborn Zhongda must be stroking his severed neck underground, boasting that his unsightly gray-white face could fetch such a good price. About two or three hundred steps to the right of Sima's tomb, there is a stone stele of the Li family's ancestral tomb. One says that it is the ancestral tomb of Li Hongzhang of Hefei, because it is buried on the dragon vein, so Hongzhang was granted the title of Duke. This statement is far-fetched and should not be taken seriously. However, I have indeed seen the stone stele of the Li family's ancestral tomb. It is impossible to know if it is connected to Hongzhang.</p>

<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Zhang Daqian came from Weitang yesterday and invited me to Dafengtang to discuss art. Zhang Ershanzi, Xie Dayu, Cen Ludan, and other gentlemen were also present. We read art, tasted tea, and discussed the past and present. The room was filled with joy, and the host and guests were very happy. Then, Shanzi presented Chen Sanli's (Poetry Elder) newly composed inscription for the tomb of the famous calligrapher Zeng Nongran. The Zhang brothers were Zeng Nongran's students and excelled in painting and calligraphy. After Nongran's death, they joined with their fellow students to organize the Zeng-Li Alumni Association, holding memorial services in spring and autumn to commemorate their teacher's virtue. It is rare to see this in the end times. Nongran's remains had already been transported back to his hometown for burial, but the inscription was still missing. His eldest son traveled to Lushan to ask the Elder Sanli to write an inscription, elaborating on Nongran's literary achievements and virtues, and describing his intimacy with Qing Daoren and Sanli in detail. However, the friendship between the two is also fully revealed in the lines. Nongran in the afterlife must be smiling and stroking his beard. The inscription is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Inscription for the Tomb of the Late Zeng, Official of the Ministry of War in the Qing Dynasty, written by Chen Sanli of Yining. The deceased was named Zeng Xi, courtesy name Ziji, formerly Siyuan, and later known as Nongran. His family has been from Hengyang for generations. He was born a year after his father's death. His mother, Madam Liu, worked hard to raise him to adulthood. He was intelligent and strong in his youth and became a student at a young age. He read widely and was skilled in literature and art. He was known among his peers for his calligraphy. Zhang Junhengjia, the envoy in charge of education, admired him and selected him to study at the School of Classics, where his studies advanced further. In the Xinmao year of Guangxu, he passed the provincial examination. He was not selected by the Ministry of Rites. He paid for the position of official and was assigned to the Ministry of War. In the Guimao year, he became a Jinshi and remained in the Ministry of War, becoming a secretary in the Department of Military Selection. Soon after, he was granted the title of Advisory Minister of the Bide Academy. Earlier, in the Jiawu year, Duke Liu Zhongcheng led troops to Shanhaiguan to defend against the Japanese pirates. He went to the military headquarters once. After retreating, he joined the public carriage to write a letter, generously presenting his political opinions. His spirit was very strong. When the demon people rioted, he hastily escorted his mother out of the capital. He was immediately robbed. He found a bamboo sedan chair for his mother to sit in and walked with a servant for about forty miles before finding a boat. At that time, his mother cried to him. He smiled to show that he was not suffering and comforted his mother. After returning south to his old residence in Hengyang, he feared the officials and accepted the position of head lecturer at Shigu Academy, also serving at Hanshou Longchi Academy. He originally studied Dai's Rites, the Gongyang Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals, and the Zuo Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals. His writing and poetry were elegant and discarded the mundane. The students who were taught by him changed their views in response. Later, he served as the director of the Normal School of Law and Politics, the Education Association, the Advisory Bureau, and the Autonomous Bureau. His reputation was high. After the national changes, his mother died at an old age. He was so devastated that he almost gave up his life.</p>

<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Eighth Episode: Limitless Sadness and Grievance in Confession, Difficult to Expect Open-Mindedness. Extreme Singing and Dancing, Glimpsing Majesty.</p>
<p>An Yutian loved these teachings, nodding his head like a stubborn stone. He said nothing more, but secretly hardened his heart to go all out. In any case, Liang Xiaoyun was doing this because she truly loved him, and it was the only way to fulfill her wishes and exchange for a future of shared happiness. Although his conscience could not help but feel that his will was weak and that he was not a gentleman, no one would pity or care for a gentleman when he was drifting and impoverished. It was better to be muddleheaded, immersed in a rare gentle village, forgetting those bookish and pedantic thoughts, and just wait for the good news to come from the field of fame and fortune. The next day, he finally saw Mao Deshun arriving in a car to pick them up. As soon as he entered the door, he jumped and bowed to the couple in a military salute, calling them "Sir" and "Madam," flattering them insincerely. Then, he hurriedly spoke about the serious matter, boasting as if he had performed a great service. "I have been paying attention all day. The commander-in-chief is about to leave Beijing in these two days and is very busy. The guests coming to the mansion in the morning and evening are even more eager to take advantage of this urgent time than usual. If Madame An goes to squeeze in with them, I'm afraid there won't be much to talk about. Now there is another good way. The commander-in-chief is definitely going to the Grand Theatre tonight to listen to the great charity performance of all the famous actors. There are more than ten boxes upstairs. The Fifth Madam originally wanted to invite Madam An to listen to the opera together. Why not also invite Sir An to go along? Just go to the theater early. When the commander-in-chief is sitting there feeling a little bored before the good operas start, I will say that I was ordered by the Fifth Madam to lead Sir An to meet him. Taking advantage of his happy mood at that time, you can definitely talk very well. It's getting dark now. Please prepare quickly. First go to the mansion to see the Fifth Madam. Then go to the Grand Theatre together to wait. Although the commander-in-chief also has many dinner appointments in the evening, he will definitely find time to arrive early in order to listen to the good operas. Quick... quick. The car is already waiting at the door. The Fifth Madam especially told me to come and urge you." Liang Xiaoyun was overjoyed. She asked Mao Deshun to rest for a while, then returned to the bedroom to wash and dress up, and instructed An Yutian to also change into a newly made and handsome robe. An Yutian thought to himself that he had really heard so many new tricks these days. There were also special and unexpected ways to see the great and wealthy people of today. You had to go to the theater box, with its mixed sounds of singing and music, to meet them, so that you could catch the commander-in-chief at a happy moment. This was truly mysterious, unfathomable, and profound.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Way of Being a Person <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>What is called the way of being a person? The scope of the way of being a person is very broad. In short, the way of being a person is not to bully others with power or to oppress the weak with strength. You must make things convenient for others and yourself.</p>
<p>The ancients had two sayings: "Do not do what pleases your loved ones but grieves your enemies, and do not do what pleases your enemies but grieves your loved ones." That is, when he is facing a great disaster, or when his coffin is closed, his personality can be judged by these two types of people.</p>
<p>For example, a beggar or someone who is absolutely poor, when they are helpless, there will always be someone to pity or help them. If it is a hooligan or someone with special authority or armed forces, even if this kind of person dies, others will not only not pity them, but will also be happy.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no absolute standard for the way of being a person, but if this person is beneficial to others in the world, he is a good person; if he is harmful to others, he is an evil person.</p>
<p>Therefore, good people fear their death, and evil people fear that they will not die. When a person reaches the critical point of life and death, the personality of an evil person and a good person can be determined by this. Therefore, just as it is with one person, so it is with a country.</p>

<p>— Meng·Tiao·An·Zhu·</p>
<p>Pheasant flies at dawn, from whence does it fly?</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles of misty sea and Penglai path.</p>
<p>A prodigal son from Penglai travels the sandy battlefield,</p>
<p>Surviving a hundred battles by the river's edge.</p>
<p>Turning his head towards his homeland, tears fall like rain,</p>
<p>Who understands the bitterness of joining the army?</p>
<p>The flying pheasant seems utterly mad,</p>
<p>Military aura dissipates into the light of powder and rouge.</p>
<p>The military gate is a fragrant cave,</p>
<p>Fine wine of grapes sent to the lips.</p>
<p>Three thousand goddesses at one's disposal,</p>
<p>All transformed into the dreams of Yangtai.</p>
<p>Leaving the door, still wearing Five-Shu coins,</p>
<p>Is it Yunsu or rain-like grease, who can tell?</p>
<p>The scenery of a celestial kingdom is truly worthy,</p>
<p>Passersby compete to watch the pheasant flying at dawn.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Wireless Radio <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Diao</p>
<p>Of all the modern inventions, none is as astonishing as wireless radio. It transmits the power of electricity through the air for thousands of miles. The saying "Ears that Hear the Wind" has already become a reality. Now, I will explain its principles to the readers.</p>
<p>Electricity can not only flow through metal but also emit a type of wave that travels through the air. The speed of this electrical wave is almost as fast as ordinary light, approximately 300 million meters per second. Electrical waves have different lengths, depending on the storage battery emitting the waves. Some electrical waves have a wavelength of 400 meters, and there are 750,000 waves per second ("300 million divided by 400 equals 750,000"). Therefore, electrical waves differ in wavelength and the number of waves per second.</p>
<p>But how can a receiver receive the electrical waves emitted from a transmitter? This relies on the action of Electric Resonance. What is electric resonance? Electric resonance occurs when a storage battery emits an electrical wave, and another storage battery of the same size, at a considerable distance, is influenced by it and can receive a good electrical wave. This electrical wave becomes an electric current and takes effect within that storage battery. If the storage battery is not the same size, then electric resonance will not occur. We can conduct an experiment using two Leyden Jars placed one foot apart. Use wire to create two square loops and connect them to the tin foil inside and outside the jars. However, one of the wire connections must not be completely secure; leave a small gap. If we pass a very strong electric current through the gap, causing sparks to jump across it, we will find that the wire connected to the other jar also has electricity. Of course, the wire we use should be the same length and thickness and placed parallel to each other.</p>
<p>Since we discovered the action of electric resonance, we have created the wireless telephone and wireless telegraph based on its principles. When a person speaks into a microphone, the varying pitch, length, and continuous nature of their voice affect the microphone, causing it to emit different electrical waves. These electrical waves reach our receiver. As long as we influence the sound-emitting speaker with this electric current and emit different sounds, all these electrical changes follow the pitch and intensity of the person's voice. Therefore, the sounds we hear from the wireless radio are exactly like the person's speech, without any difference.</p>

<p>— Yunzong</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I was passing by ×× Road for some errands when I saw my girlfriend, Ying, walking quickly towards me from the opposite direction. She said breathlessly, "Zhu! You've come at the right time! Today, I ran into a 'rascal!'" Her lovely face showed great panic.</p>
<p>"Which one? Where is he?" I asked boldly, showing an attitude of standing up for her. I saw a young man wearing a felt hat and a blue gown behind Ying, turning around and running away.</p>
<p>Ying, still unsettled, pointed at the young man and said, "There! That's him! Oh dear! I was so scared!"</p>
<p>"What happened? Where are you going now?" I continued asking.</p>
<p>"I'm going to school! I came out of my house and was walking to the intersection of ×× Road when suddenly that stranger jumped out from the side and rudely said, 'Miss! I've been thinking about you for a long time!' I was shocked and knew he was no good. I angrily rebuked him, saying, 'Get lost! Be smart!' As I said that, I walked away with big strides, but he still followed closely, saying,</p>
<p>'Ever since our encounter in ×× Lane, I've been unable to forget you, even in my dreams. Today, I see your beautiful face again; it's truly a predestined fate. May I ask for your honorable surname and given name? Where is your fragrant boudoir? How old are you? What school do you attend? Please tell me in detail. We can correspond often and study together. I look forward to it!'</p>
<p>I completely ignored him and just walked silently. But when I walked fast, he also walked fast; when I walked slowly, he also walked slowly. I lost patience and cursed at him, calling him a 'pig'! He still followed closely. I was truly both angry and flustered. Luckily, I ran into you; that 'rascal' finally ran away. If you hadn't come, I would have suffered another moment of tormented entanglement!" After she finished speaking, she seemed somewhat embarrassed.</p>
<p>I said with a smile, "This is the 'Miss's' difficulty in walking the road!"</p>

<h3 id="e228">On Avenue Joffre <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Nu</p>
<p>On the Avenue Joffre, which is full of exotic flavors, my friend recently discovered a secret. I thought that many people might not know this secret, so let me reveal it here.</p>
<p>The truth is this: one afternoon during a drunken spring breeze, my friend was returning from the Lower Park. At a bus stop, he boarded a tram. At this time, people were crowding together. Coincidentally, a foreign young woman squeezed in front of my friend. Her hair was curled, her lips were painted with lipstick, and she wore a fitted red dress, floating like a fairy. The tram sped forward, and the sensual scent wafted from the young woman's side, making my friend feel intoxicated. The season was spring, and the person standing in front of him was also a spring character, so my friend naturally had to let the fragrance of spring intoxicate his senses.</p>
<p>My friend just stood there blankly, not caring that the foreign young woman's head was leaning against his chest. My friend didn't notice what the young woman did afterward at all.</p>
<p>Only once, his hat seemed to touch something. He focused and looked back to see that next to him stood a foreign man. Anyone could tell at a glance which country these people came from. Although they had a country, their country did not accept them. These were the White Russians we are familiar with. At the time, my friend didn't think it was a big deal. After one glance, he stood still in his original position until the young woman got off the tram. Only then did he turn around as if he had lost something and sat down in the car.</p>
<p>When he returned home and touched his pocket, his wallet was gone. He was stunned and then understood what the young woman's intimacy just now meant.</p>

<p>The purpose of going to an entertainment venue is for everyone to find some joy because they are too bored from working or studying every day! However, the reality is often not like that.</p>
<p>One day, my friend was very happy and knew I was very poor, so he invited me to see a movie and also invited several Misses. We entered a relatively large movie theater. The movie had already started a few minutes before, so we all found our seats in the dark, following the direction of the usher's flashlight.</p>
<p>At this time, everyone was silent, watching the movie unfold scene by scene. At the same time, a Miss who was very fluent in English was reading the words on the screen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, after a while, two Misses behind me started crying. We all looked back in surprise. My friend asked what was wrong.</p>
<p>One of the ladies said, "Ah! It turns out there is a sentimental Miss who sympathizes with the sadness in the movie! That's why she's crying."</p>
<p>At that time, I thought that there are many people in the world who shed tears over books, but in my opinion, the plot of this movie was not very good. There were one or two scenes that were a bit tense, which only made me freeze for a while. Ultimately, it wasn't worth crying over. Therefore, I discovered that women are indeed softer than men.</p>
