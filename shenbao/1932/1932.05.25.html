<h3 id="c1">目前預防水災之重要彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>客歲霪雨之初。記者即會爲文呼籲政府及國人。急施防禦。不幸不加措意。遂致洪水橫决。吞州没縣。十餘省之田廬房舍。半沉波底。五千萬人之生命財產。盡付東流災情之慘重。百年罕見。迄今追念。猶爲寒心。</p>
<p>往者己矣。今漢口一地。月初以來氣候陰沉霪雨不畷江流日見泛溢。一般人均抱洪水再見之杞憂。武昌之武泰閘。日前即以險聞。而關係漢口安危之張公堤停工己久。禍燃眉睫顧念前途。吾人又爲之不寒而慄。</p>
<p>四月十六日國府救濟水災委員會辛博森抵漢。視察災情以卾省急待振濟之災民。尙有三十萬人。現每日多以草根加麥充飢。且每日僅食一次。以消化不良。病者累累。頗爲關心。又聞卾中一帶。樹皮亦作價出售。每斤在百文以上。其他逃至四方。輾轉流離面黃飢瘦形容枯槁者。觸目皆是。村舍寂寞田畝</p>
<p>荒蕪。即歲榖豐登。元氣亦難興復。更何容痛肉之上復加刀創設使此次又不早爲防禦使洪水得以再肆其茶毒。則此僅存之孑遺。寗尙有噍類耶。</p>
<p>吾人於去歲水災。曾謂「災禍發生。實非天降。責盡在人。」處今日科學昌明之世界中旣不能防之於前復不能救之於後。一而再再而三。終至無年不荒。在國爲恥。在民爲痛。一之爲甚。豈容再見。</p>
<p>荷蘭一低窪之小國耳。土地大半低於海面。然而風輪頻轉。溝渠暢流。鮮有水患之發生。是則地理上之設施。足以防水勢之己然者。他若調節雨量。可藉助於造林。而日前報載。蘇聨發明驅雪佈雨等控制天時之機。則直能防水患於未然矣。何我國竟長此　頇而罔覺也。</p>
<p>若曰國庫空虛。則一舉贈人。動輒數萬。何獨於此無之。且政府近來力謀建設都市。以供觀瞻南京建築巍峨西安又告大府。政府之宫室。固高矣美矣。但此滿目荒凉。村舍零落之慘狀。即不言力謀興復。豈忍再坐視洚水再發。完全隨巨浪以俱去耶。吾人切盼政府懲去歲之失。急即着手。從事預防。此爲國脈民命之所繫。政府愼勿再颟頇坐視。以陷民族於無可挽救之地。</p>

<p>上海報界工會爲郵工罷工宣言云、轟轟烈烈的上海郵工大罷工、終於由醖釀而至於爆發了、這次的遠因和近因、各方面的消息報告都很詳細、從這許多詳細的報告裏、我們很明白這次郵工的罷工、完全是出於愛護郵政、爲救郵而奮鬥、這種大公無私的勇敢犠牲精神、我們對之很表萬分的同情、但不幸得很、當我們仔細回顧三天來的情形、不禁毛髮悚然、爲什麽呢、看那由於罷工而至各地消息阻滯、凡能深知這次罷工原因的、當能鑒及、可是帝國主義者、却在「維持消息靈通」的美名掩該之下、開始作掠奪郵權的準備了、如果這個準備也隨了郵潮的擴大、而擴大起來、那末、我們敢預言、整個的中國郵權眼睜睜的送入虎口、而無法挽救、這時候、在郵工主觀上、誠然爲救郵而罷工、然在客觀上、恰得了相反的結果、所以我們對於此次郵工罷工、在原則上雖表十二分的同情、然在目前這種形勢之下、如果仍舊延長下去、結果恐將有害無利了、好在自罷工以後、當局己表示能完全接受郵工所提出的要求、祗不過對於救郵的方案、尙待以後商、現在郵工本身的要求、旣能解决、當不致使郵權落入虎口、故此罷工己無繼續延長或再使之擴大的必要、尙望明察的郵工同人和全國各界同胞們、加以注意、則中國幸甚、郵務的前途幸甚、謹此宣言、上海幸界工會、</p>

<p>社會之交通秩序而不致此不幸事件之擴大、並能從速早日解决、不致因愛護郵政而反有碍於郵政、且更波及人民之交通秩序、尤其是於郵工罷工之後、工部局即乘機成立臨時郵政以替代、其目的固爲便利交通、法良意美、然影響於我國郵政之主權以及郵工本身之利害、誠有莫大之關係與隠憂、甚望我政府及郵工同人切實注意及之、本會於此、用特鄭重宣言、</p>

<h3 id="c162">選拔之日期 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>

<p>鄉下人一談到我就聨想到敲鐘，所以喊我鐘兒，久而久之，鐘兒便成了我唯一的名字。但是我在古廟裏做的事不止是敲鐘。大槪是因爲敲鐘這一件事曾與鄉下人發生密切的關係，他們便把他牢牢的記着，其餘不和他們發生關係的事，他們就不大知道了。我的日常工作。除敲鐘之外是挑水，種菜。還有，爲和尙倒夜壺。挑水種菜二事我是做得和敲鐘一樣的認眞，暫時無膚多談。只有爲和尙倒夜壺那件事我是不好意思說却又不忍不說。我從六歲起就做着這個工作，算到現在差不多是倒了十年的夜壺。起初我只知道夜壺的氣味有些難聞，還以爲這是孩子們應該做的事。和尙用得着論語的時候也是孔子的信徒。他時常把「有事，弟子服其勞。」這句話解釋給我聽。惰他說。這些事裏面是包含了倒夜壺。</p>
<p>最近，我開始懷疑了；「和尙也有手，夜壶爲什麽不」自己倒？病人，老人是應該有人看護。年紀輕輕的和尙，又不害病，爲什麽要我服侍？」我想到這裏立刻提起筆來冩了四句話：</p>
<p>「我有一雙手，</p>
<p>敲鐘種菜蔬。</p>
<p>爲人倒夜壺，</p>
<p>不是大丈夫。」</p>
<p>當晚我是下了一個絶大的决心；從今以後，只做大衆的公僕，不做個人的聽差。</p>
<p>次日晚飯後，和尙拿起夜壺，覺得很重，知道是没有倒，喊我進房用旱烟管指着夜壺說：「你飯也忘記吃了嗎？倒去！」</p>
<p>我說：「我不能倒！」</p>
<p>他說；「你的手爛掉了不成？」</p>
<p>我說：「你的手呢？自己的夜壺自己倒！」</p>
<p>他氣得拿旱烟管瞄準我的頭腦榖敲來，我順手接了過去，括擦一聲便折爲兩段！他馬上向我胸前送來一拳，我退一步右手接着他的拳左手托着他的肘，笑嘻嘻的推他一推說：「用你打人的力氣去倒自己的夜壺吧！」</p>
<p>當我接着和尙的拳，托着和尙的肘，只要順手一壓，便可以呌他跌在地上吃泥。我爲什麽不這樣幹呢？和尙實在是打不過我。我的拳頭不打那比我力小的人。何况我的宗旨只是不再爲他倒夜壺，他動手打我，我不得己出而抵抗，只須使他知道我是威武不能屈就算罷了，何必賣弄我的力氣呢？和尙終不覺悟，氣憤憤的說；「滾蛋！這個廟裏的飯，不是你吃的。背着你的破布爛棉花滾！」說了，和尙悻悻走出廟門，不知道他到那兒去過夜了。</p>
<p>我是等着敲過最後一次的曉鐘，告别了鄉下朋友，再向那海闊天空去賺飯吃。</p>

<p>— 賴札</p>
<p>吾生平頂歡喜讀哲學，因爲哲學是研究一切科學的鑰匙。吾譯暫學爲「致知學」，因爲先有「致知」，才後可以「格物」，先有邏輯，才後可以着手研究。</p>
<p>吾讀哲學越讀越起，晚上點了洋蠟燭，連夜看書，看得連眼光都變了近視。</p>
<p>那時，買書眞不容易。輪船從歐洲來，要經過好望角，大兜其圈子，冩信去定書，要一二年後纔有回信。後來，蘇蘇士運河通了，（翰按蘇彛士運河通於一八六九年）船經運河，用岸上的馬拉縴，交通交便當一些。</p>
<p>吾認爲哲學著作之好，再比不上拉丁本了。吾曾爲震旦編了一部講義呌做致知淺說。後來，吾整理一下，由商務出版。這部致知淺說是吾根據幾種最淺顯的拉丁作家做藍本而編纂成的。吾譯的種種名詞，往往引用佛家式道家言。譬如Lndividu人家都譯做「個人」，吾譯做「局自體」，這是佛經上的名詞。譬如，體積所占的空間，吾稱做「方位」，這也是佛經上的名詞。</p>
<p>致知淺說祇說了名學部份。但是看了這本書，就可以知道中國文字不通的地方。</p>

<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>日本自犬養内閣被戕。一時軍人氣燄甚盛。法西斯蒂主義。甚囂塵上。政黨内閣。瀕告破產。果也。消息傳來。木閣銷聲。（鈴木也）藤閣勃起。（齋藤也）行見從此日本軍閥得勢。政黨政治。不絶如縷矣。當茲藤閣降生伊始。用述蠡見。以作諧譚。</p>
<p>夫藤之爲物。旣堅且强剛柔並具。日本歷來之外交政策。糜不威脅利誘。兼而有之。所謂善用其軟硬勁者是也。此後齋藤主政。行將益見其藤皮老臉。牽絲扳藤矣。</p>
<p>藤爲依木而生之植物。此次齋「藤」組閣。蔣惟荒「木」之馬首是瞻。蓋亦意中事也。</p>
<p>或曰。鈴木。亦木也。何以見屈於藤。余曰。鈴木之木。雖非朽木。但木繫於鈴。究非大器。故不足以支大厦。非若老藤之結實也。</p>
<p>又有詢余者曰。齋藤組閣。就字論義。其政策亦可得而蠡測乎。余曰。藤之爲物。無隙不繞。一樹不足。再而之他。乃最善侵略之植物也。藤閣之政策。或猶是耳。日本官吏之以藤名者。見於報紙。有佐藤。加藤。伊藤等。茲更益以齋藤。先後映輝。日閣可作藤器舖矣。</p>
<p>纒夾先生讀吾文意。笑曰。藤之爲藤。不僅可作手杖。編器物之黃藤也。舉凡絲瓜則有絲瓜藤。西瓜則有西瓜藤。剌人者則曰毛毛藤。製菜肴者則有狗杞藤。</p>
<p>余曰。是矣。此眞狗死藤也。夫狗即犬也。「犬」養死而齋「藤」繼。非狗死藤而何。聞者咸爲撫掌。</p>

<p>— 寒廬</p>
<p>到崑山太倉去勞軍的一天。步哨槍聲。續續可聞。形勢雖很嚴重。而全體將士態度鎭靜。生活愉快。絶對没有感覺到戰爭的恐怖。</p>
<p>微風飄拂着音韻嫋嫋的唱片聲。依稀辨得出是粤曲柳摇金的一折。在戰壕裏面。也常常可以看到一種特殊的軍械！留聲機器。這確是他們娱樂上唯一的恩物。</p>
<p>馬鞍山下運動塲上。許多武裝同志正在努力於足球的競爭。擔任評判的是一位少年軍官。興趣的濃厚。正和學校生活一般無二。其他。從事於國術表演。武藝比試的。更見得勇氣百倍。興會淋漓。</p>
<p>一小隊將士們。很認眞於「强渡」的演習。在河流邊。卸去了軍衣褲。擎起了手槍步槍。從那冷水深泥的河中涉水奮呼而過。上岸時。大家都很興奮。竟没有介意到肌肉的紅凍。</p>
<p>領導參觀的沈營長向我們作簡要的解答。他說。「我們確信戰鬥能力的强大。精神比較物質格外來得重要。敝軍訓練方法。最注重於「軍隊家庭化」的實現。主旨在使得弟兄們生活上愉快活潑而多興趣。因此。每天除例操以外。種種娱樂的提倡。差不多己漸漸成了常課。」</p>
<p>我不由不驚佩着十九路軍組織的完密與精神的偉大。同時。因着軍中娱樂聨想及於最近看到一部集合各種歌曲游藝而成的有聲國片「銀星幸運」所給予我精神上的快感。以及其中參加的「得勝鑼鼓」等暗示救國的深意。很可以見到國難時期並没有廢棄那正當娱樂的必要。</p>
<p>茫茫歸途中。不住的映現着軍隊生活的一幕。又想。將士們的精神慰勞。「銀星幸運」誠然是良好的貢獻品。不過最好應在痛飲黃龍的那一天。</p>

<p>「你會經親眼看見過這些事情嘕？」我問。</p>
<p>我們在討論這個問題的時候，怱然來了一陣震聾耳朶的聲音，擊鼓聲，鏡鈸，打鐘聲，從對面的廟裏送來，這些少女同時大聲呌喊着：</p>
<p>「這些是何等殘酷的行動呀！」</p>
<p>「你最近會見過甘地先生麽？你看他怎樣？」我問。</p>
<p>「他說他很好，但我對他說，「爲什麽我祗是看見你的骨子。」但他說他一定覺得很好。」</p>
<p>但他說他的食物現在己改變了，他己不吃羊乳而吃葡萄乾和菓汁了。」</p>
<p>「司蘭德小姐被捕以後，他作何感想？」我問。</p>
<p>「我曾告訴他，他們把米拉布捉去了，但他說「是的，他們把伊捉去了。」他對這件事早」</p>
<p>己知道，他什麽事情都知道，他早曾對我說伊要被捕的，而所有的事情，他所預科的，什麽都會實現的。」</p>
<p>「那些殘酷的事情究竟怎樣了？」那位青年在狂呼，那時對面來的喧擾聲，似乎更厲害了·劈拍劈拍，好像暴雨中的雷鳴。</p>
<p>「你們現在的計劃是怎樣，夫人？」我問「你再想回到監獄裏去重作犯人麽？」</p>
<p>我的計劃是繼續爲祖國工作，」伊答道·「爲着祖國而服務，一切聽憑上帝的擺佈，我們」</p>
<p>應當要忍耐着，而我正在預備着有什麽不幸事件的發生呢！」</p>
<p>甘地夫人立了起來，照了印度的送别禮，和我握了一下手·而同時那位青年，竟不肯否認，一定說那是殘酷的事件又發生了·</p>
<p>「好，那麽究竟是什麽一回事情呢？」我對他問，和他還是第一次談話呢。</p>
<p>他對我目不轉睛的凝視了一回。</p>
<p>「你看見過那些事情麽？」我問。</p>
<p>「不。」</p>
<p>「那麽你個人方面，知道什麽人做些事情呢？」</p>

<p>第八回　無邊哀怨懴情中難期曠逹　極度聲歌行樂裏得覩威嚴</p>
<p>果然憑這一點點東西。便討著伊眞心歡喜。極肯出力的替你帮忙。當塲把葉督軍請了來。當面說妥。你的事可算十亭中有九亭九靠得住了呢。又還有個姓名呌毛德順的人。是我們從前拉胡琴敎戲的毛帥傅的小兒子。時常跟他爸爸同應我們堂差。當下手彈月琴。如今人長大了。投奔到五太太那裏。承伊肯提拔。改了行當伊貼身的隨從小副官了。我見著後也賞了他一點錢。爲的聽說葉督軍很不容易見得著。你比不得我能穿堂入戸。逕去找五太太設法。將來若單獨去見老葉。怕免不了有阻碍。那就又用得著這個小毛。可以揀機會領你進去。大槪一半天那小毛就會替你布置妥貼。親自前來邀你。你只預備見老葉時該是怎樣說法。務使一說便能合拍。那就可以逹到極大的目的了。安玉田趕忙陪笑道。你眞能。這些門道。我的是一竅兒不通。若不是你替我去忙。我便做夢也未能夢想到要辦這種事。少不得以後還要勞你常常的指敎。梁笑雲很得意的囅然微笑。默然沉思。隨又想出許多問題。一項項遂漸提出來與安玉田詳加討論。及研究到未來的位置與最後的希望。安玉田自分資淺人微。所求不應過奢。目前若能弄到一個閒散差事。也將就可以滿意。伊却　堅决的主張。事情旣說到如此順遂。好機會不可錯過。索興就撈摸一點實權。要幹上級的帶兵官。最不濟也當弄個步兵上校的團長到手。即使没有現成的空缺可補。也還可請求成立新隊伍。自去招收軍隊。我己向老葉說過。你在本鄉本土裏有那樣的名望與實力。無論招安土匪或收編民團。都立刻能號召多少人。只請老葉下一張委任。給一個旅團長或司令的名義。包就能對老葉出力報效。安玉田聽到這。不勝駭異。便跳起來摇手道。你說得太眩惑没有邊了。雖說現今在外面混事。人不可忒老暫。總多少得吹一點牛皮。但像你這樣信口替我胡吹亂吹。實際上我决没有那樣大的能耐。吹出去以後。將來敎我怎麽樣能辦得到。豈不終久要閙笑話。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>鬼神有無問題，我國閙了幾千百年，尙没解决，現在奇了，偏偏閙到科學世界的英國去了，</p>
<p>茲據路透電訊，英國利物浦地方，有一所大房子裏，近年常常閙鬼，男子被鬼推滾下樓，女子被鬼摔落廳裏，使一般鄰居，聽得毛骨悚然，眞是奇怪，　　子不語鬼力亂神，孔子不敢說無鬼，祗是不語，又曰敬鬼神而遠之，若無鬼神，敬他則甚，似孔子還是主張兩元論的，六朝蕭子良，篤好釋氏，范縝盛稱無佛，縝又著滅神論，以爲形者神之質，神者形之用，神之於形，猶利之於刀，未聞刀没而利存，子良無以難，是范縝絶對主張一元論的，</p>
<p>惟以我所聞，像我國怪異之書，不可勝錄，即從朋輩中得來，耳聞目見的事實，亦不可殫述，故取精用宏，相驚伯有，以常理推測，固非不可能之事，即如伍廷芳博士，亦有人鬼溝通之說，英國靈魂學家某君，亦謂有五鬼可與直接談話，</p>
<p>近來「科學家」與「玄學家，」尙閙得鳥烟嶂氣，兩不相容，我想還是科學尙未完全發明的緣故，倘使靈魂之學，用科學方法來研究，一定可以成功一種專門的學問呢，</p>

<p>— 挹雲譯</p>
<p>藍黑墨水，又稱鐵五倍子墨水。以鐵鹽，鞣酸與藍色顔料相混和即成。鐵鹽與鞣酸相遇，成鞣酸低鐵，（FerrousTaunate），該物並無顔色，但若暴與空氣中，即迅速氧化，而成黑色之鞣酸高鐵（Ferrictaunate）。此即墨水冩下時爲藍色，移時變成藍黑色之故。</p>
<p>法以鞣酸四克，置燒杯中（玻杯亦可），加三百立方厘水而熱之至鞣酸溶盡止，靜置待冷。另以綠樊（即硫酸鐵）五克，溶於一百立方厘水中。若其液現黃色，可加數滴稀硫酸，使回復原有之青色。再以三克之藍，溶於二百立方厘之水中，拦溶之。加阿拉伯樹膠三克（約十立方厘），再加五立方厘甘油，一二滴之石炭酸。（石炭酸爲防止墨水生霉）。</p>
<p>將硫酸鐵液，加入己冷之鞣酸溶液。再將此混和液，加入顔料液。再以水五百立方厘釋稀之。拦匀後，以慮紙或夏布濾過，裝入瓶中，塞以木塞，即可隨時取用。（譯directionpapor）</p>
<p>前予與同學，依此分量而製，其濃淡均甚適宜，較市上售品，實有過之無不及。設萬一太淡，則可加熱，以减少其中之水分。若太濃，則可加水釋稀。倘一不小心，身上沾染墨水，水洗之不見效，可見檸檬汁洗之即去。</p>
<p>按墨水製造法，本刋前己登載一文，此篇與前法略有不同，故復披露如右，編者識。</p>

<p>顔料不僅用於繪事，又爲油漆之主要原料，亦可用以染色及製造墨水，其功用甚大。請分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）普魯士藍　黃血鹽一克，三氧化鐵六克。</p>
<p>（二）鮮紅　等量之碘化鉀與二氯化銾。</p>
<p>（三）鋇白　等量之硫化鋇及硫酸鋅。</p>
<p>（四）鉻黃　醋酸鉛十克，鉻酸鉀六克。</p>
<p>法將各物各溶於水，然後互相混和，靜置片時。濾過，用水洗顔料粉二三次，使乾，研之，即成各色之顔料。</p>
<p>（五）鉻橙　以鉻黃加少許苛性納液，共熱之，即成橙色。</p>
<p>（六）青　以鋇白，普魯士藍，及鉻黃相調，能成草青以至深青之各種青。</p>
<p>將以上顔料，加數滴亞麻仁油，拌匀後，再加數滴松節油，即成各色之油漆。</p>
<p>前項濾過之濾液，爲氧化鉀，醋酸鉀，及硫化鋅等。可分瓶藏之，以備他用。篇幅有限，容待另文述之。</p>

<p>但是錢呢？錢呢？何况是要馬上寄去！</p>
<p>他訪遍了所有的友人，他反覆的在床上思考，整夜不寐。最後他總算有了辦法：妻還有一件印度綢的長衣留在箱裏，自己的一件　嘰夾袍，己經不必穿了。哼！這只少可以當十五塊錢吧？這只是可以救救急的。但是夾袍大汚，假如不洗一次，一定是没有人要的。最後他决定將他送到洗染公司去</p>
<p>於是他比較安心了。然而妻的瘦削的哭臉以及孩子的微弱的呼吸常在心頭浮動。</p>
<p>很悒鬱的挨過了四天以後，他從洗染店裏拿回了這一件可救孩子性命的衣裳，他更覺得心頭舒服了。不由的臉上也泛上一抺近日來不曾有過的微笑。但是他還得檢查一下。假如衣裳上有了破洞那是當不起價的，可是糟糕，果然不幸在下揑極其明顯的地方有了一個大洞，這還有誰要呢？……無法可想，只得再送到裁縫店裏去。</p>
<p>丨喂！請快點替我補一補。</p>
<p>丨好的，先生：你明天晚上來拿罷。</p>
<p>丨再快一點不可以嗎？</p>
<p>丨先生！那眞是來不及。</p>
<p>這一夜他又是失眠。剛一睡去，便看見自己的孩子己經死了，妻在旁邊嘶着聲音哭，於是他也大哭，並且撕着頭髮，搥着胸口。……醒轉來只是一頭冷汗。「啊！幸而還是一個夢。然而這是一個不祥的預兆啊！不過後天早上一定可以寄去。」</p>
<p>上早一醒來，他懷着沉重的心預備再焦急挨到晚上。</p>
<p>中飯時他又得着一個不好的消息，那就是郵政罷工，這怎麽好呢？電匯是不可能的。幸而在報紙上發現航空並不罷工，然而是否可以匯錢呢？却還是一個疑問啊……不管，等晚上先拿着錢再說罷。</p>
<p>電燈亮了，他在裁縫店裏。</p>
<p>丨先生！眞對不起，我們太忙，大家都在趕製夏衣。先生的是秋衣。現在己不必穿了，還是請再等幾天來拿罷。</p>
<p>丨可是，……呀！</p>
<p>說明嗎？丨不，還是不說。這怎麽好意思說呢？於是儼如受了重傷似的走出了店門。</p>
<p>丨啊！我的孩子約！……我看見你的臉了！</p>
<p>回家時，他以被蒙着臉，……</p>
<p>穿西洋鏡</p>
<h3 id="c261">大律師 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 祺華</p>
<p>近來上海的大律師，好像多得己經很夠了，我們走出門口，就可以看見×××大律師，××合組事務所的招牌，掛得淋琅滿目：但是大律師製造所，還是在整批的製造出來，恐怕不久的將來，馬路上要五步一律師，十步一事務所，弄得非常閙熱了，</p>
<p>大律師第一天掛牌，終要登一個廣告，第一件天經地義的大題目，便是「保障人權」但是老實說，他們的，唯一目的實是職業問題，</p>
<p>現在我們再來研究研究，大律師爲怎麽這樣的興隆，</p>
<p>第一個原因，因爲上海的離婚非常盛行，但是離婚這一幕戲中　一定要用着大律師的，後來離婚案子一天多一天，弄得大律師接應不暇，所以大律師增加起來，</p>
<p>上海有錢的人很多，老頭子眼睛一閉，幾位兒子就要閙分遺產，分得不平均，又要請敎大律師了，這又是一個原因，</p>
<p>上海出風頭的人很多，他們有了一些錢，就要請一位大律師來做常年法律顧問了，有許多人竟請了幾位；所以出風頭的人愈多，大律師愈需要，這也是一個原因。</p>
<p>還有，學做大律師比較便當些，這是有事實可以證明的，我們校裏讀理科學生的人數，終不及讀法科的人數多，並且他們都是下午五時後上課的，日間還可以另謀職業，他們的敎授有時候不來授課，因爲他們都是大律師，交際很廣闊，有了朋友請他吃夜飯，他就不能到校：但是對於學生很便當，因爲他們也可以早些回家去，這倒也是一個原因，</p>
<p>以上的四個原因，是我的同學一位小律師告訴我的，他的父親是大律師，他家裏要二代做律師，我想講給我聽的原因不見得會錯的。他還說；「有分遺產的生意來，我們最歡迎；倘使做着一次，三個月内事務所裏無人走進來，還可以不擔憂，」</p>

<p>— 杜鵑</p>
<p>「收紙錠灰！收紙錠灰！」我們到處都可以聽見，並且再可看到一種特殊的尊容，比銀幕上卓别麟更爲要滑稽，比裴斯開登尤爲要冷靜，頭上幾十年一根曲辫子，加上乾隆時代的氈帽，紙錠灰色的臉兒，十四世紀的衣服，脚上一雙眞正國貨的草鞋，右肩掛着竹籃左手拿着旱烟罐，假使請一位考古博士來估量，到還值得去研究研究，</p>
<p>我再把他們的麫包問題來說，在上海賣紙錠灰的人，一共有八九百餘人之多，他們的籍貫山陰會稽，别處的人没有的，聽他們說，這是山陰的特產，在這八九百中，自己有資本的，不過一百人，其他八百人，都是每天收來賣給爐主的，爐廠共有十餘家，資本要算神廟徐某開的最大，薛弄底孫某次之，最好的紙錠灰，可烊錫對拆，在收賣時，假使賣者偶一不愼，就給他們掉包，他們的正業，都是種田，田中忙碌時候，就回鄉去，田種定了再來，他們非但可以享受到上海的繁華，並且麫包問題亦就此解决了，</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論</p>
<h3 id="c267">新車替代舊車甘 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>購買汽車此其時矣</p>
<p>一九三二年新汽車模型於去年末季上市時。各廠家即令其生力軍之汽車出品努力向前。及至今年一月汽車展覽會開幕。各色各樣之汽車成羣結隊而來。於是上說乃更證實矣。待展覽會會期終止。以後之數個月中。事實尤爲明顯。各廠家均一致下有决心。羣以其新出品之汽車爲前鋒。猛攻一九三二年之局勢焉。</p>
<p>一九三二年新車之機構方面進步。渠等咸能自爲表白之。機師等對於新車引擎之進步自屬一目了然。但大多數之汽車駕駛家。非可比擬於機師者。渠等對於新車表示好感。但渠等所知者。不過廠家方面之言。謂新車售價低廉。逈非從前所出之汽車所可比擬。</p>
<p>意圖購買新車之買主。據人言一九三二年之新汽車。較之從前者。無往而不進步優美。故咸欲若蜚購買。而自行審别。於是其中若干人即從而購置之。莫不欣喜逾恒。顧客方面均謂一九三二年之新汽車。質料精美。售價公道。較之從前出品。進步多多。凡目下顧主方面所言者。即今年開首時廠方所宣揚者也。若輩所掛在口頭者。非爲討論所欲出售之汽車。而談讑所欲買置之新汽車。</p>
<p>新汽車之基本價值外。尙有各種進步。如乘坐之舒適。駕駛上之安全及便捷是也。車架·摩托·及車身之進步。往往不爲非機械家者所知。能增加汽車之服務能力。及其壽命。而各種改良又能增加使用時之愉快。此種革新之汽車。其目下之售價。尙有爲一般人所思考及者。第一。其售價較之往年之汽車爲低廉。第二。目下之低價不能保持其長久不變更。據各廠主腦人之意見。新車價格有不得不增加之勢。</p>
<p>今年開始以來。汽車售價旣有减削。亦有增加。而市上大有一種論調。謂汽車之削價業己至最低之限度。故據各廠主腦人言。今後車價之更動。祗爲增加而己矣。此外又国美聨邦政府不久對於汽車又將徵稅。因之經售商之進本。將自動的增長矣。</p>
<p>職是之故。或謂欲買汽車。自當以目下爲最適宜。而此外又可不言而喻者。即買主大可傾其所有。放胆以求新車之購置也。凡購置新汽車之思想一起。則處置舊汽車之問題亦必隨之俱來。許多人深信將現有之汽車。多留一年爲得計。其中若干人此種之見解爲無誤。但亦不盡然。車主常有一種經騐。即一輛汽車在其生命的某一個時期中。用以服務殊不經濟。及至日舊一日。其維持之費用亦必日有增加。於是不時理修。其修理及照顧之費用。較之新車之費用。所增實多。</p>
<p>故現有舊汽車者。對於此種問題。不能忽視之。必須通盤計算。究經保持多恙善病之汽車爲經濟。抑購置康健强壯之新汽車爲省錢。尙有安全問題亦須顧到。許多用舊之汽車。對於車中人及路上駕駛者。殊有明顯之危險。苟能一思危險之發生。則於經濟節省之觀念。當不過慮矣。</p>
<p>凡未經購買汽車。及常購一種價格不相上下之汽車者。當未知本年各種汽車之售價若何。買車者可傾其所有置一新車。凡欲購置一車。若因心雖深喜。而嫌其售價過昻。或願略出高價者。則不妨於此項汽車之一類中。更擇貨身略高。或略低者。購買之。購車者盡可以三百三十元之代價。買一小奥斯汀。或以一萬三千七百十元置一杜森柏華貴汽車也。</p>
<p>就上述售價懸殊之兩種汽車而言。其中問之各式各樣車輛。苟欲以價值分類。殊非易事。若干種之汽車在一類中或爲售價甚低者。然在他類中視之己甚昻貴矣。故各種汽車之中。實不能立一確切之界限。事甚明顯。但自大體上言之。美國所製造之三十種牌子之汽車。可分爲低價。中低價。中價。中高價。及高價數種</p>
<p>除少數種之汽車外。低價汽車之售價大槪爲七百元左右。如四隻汽缸之奥斯汀。通用所出之六缸雪佛蘭。四缸及八缸福特。四缸潑萊茅斯。及六缸惠萊士哇浮蘭等是也。小奥斯汀之售價。大槪自三百三十元至五百五十元美金。雪佛蘭之售價近己减削。約自四百四十五元至六百二十五元之譜。福特之新四缸者自四百十元起至六百元。Ｖ八者每一種增五十元。由四百六十元至六百五十元不等。一九三二年式克雷斯勒之潑萊茅斯牌。售價自四百九十五元起。至七百八十五元之可以移動之轎車止。惠萊士哇浮蘭「六」新車自四百十五元起至六百六十五元止。售價自七百元起至一千元之汽車。大都列於中低價之種類中。其中若干種不及七百元。亦有若干種略逾一千元之數。但大半均在七百與一千之間。</p>
<p>利益。如將硯在的短距離輕便火車加以適當的流缐化。則每小時行駛七十五至八十英里之速度。所需要的總馬力可以减少至一半以上。</p>
<p>預料這些試騐的結果。將有革命的高速火車式樣計晝出來。流缐化之應用於火車也許不若應用於飛機者之廣。然觀乎己往的成績。不難想見其在該方面的未來的發展。</p>
<p>回溯一九一零年人類開始探索天空的時候。流缐化初次在空中作眞實的試騐。此間所受到的阻力完全是空氣阻力原有的箱子式飛機遂即被認爲不適用而改作了流缐形。</p>
<p>美國全國航空諮詢委員會主席愛姆斯博士。曾謂充分的流缐化足以减少飛機的阻力三分之二。那麽美國各航空線上的任何三座發動機的巨大飛機。如果加以適當的改造。當可减少二座引擎。而仍保持和目前同樣的速度。</p>
<p>觀乎最近英國皇家航空隊的表演。可知今日飛機製造家的重視流缐化。在力求更完全的流缐化的研究中。己經得到了多種減少風力的飛機新式樣。此後流缐化在航空方面尙有充分發展的餘地</p>

<p>arles　Maurpin）實騐的結果。斷定空氣阻力至少爲火車所受全阻力的三分之一。所以如把法國的火車依照流缐化原理加以適當的改造。則每年所耗煤量當可减省一百萬噸之譜。</p>
<p>歐洲大陸上己經有幾輛火車多少流線化了。一輛是法國北部的「金箭號」。牠和形狀和牠的名稱一樣的古怪。車廂是密合地接連着。後面拖着一條閃光的鋁質圓錐形尾巴。德國的徐柏林火車活像一條巨魚。牠是藉裝在後面的一個推進器行動的。最近牠建樹了每小時一百四十三英里的速度新紀錄。即在美國亦可見到烟囟和車頭燈隠藏在裏面的圓角機車了。</p>
<p>美國威斯汀好斯研究實騐所現正試騐流缐化應用於特别快車及輕便火車的效果。研究主任鐵德强博士。由研究得到一種信念。以爲快班火車的流缐化足以减少風的阻力三分之二。及車身所受總阻力二分之一·鐵氏又覺得流線對於重大慢車雖不甚重要。而對於輕便火車則甚有。目前飛機的落地齒輪和坐席的突出部分等。足以增加空氣阻力百分之五十或以上倘發動機無若何根本改造而欲使飛機速度多所增加。那就非把那些部分除去或築入機身不可。</p>
<p>流線化在航海方面。一如在陸運及航空方面。也開始有飛速的進步。汽船之能有每小時幾及百英里的速度。其主要原因是船身式樣的改革。舊式的Ｖ形汽船。排水甚多。因而受阻甚巨。自改成平坦的水上飛機式樣後。其速率驟增三倍之多。</p>
<p>局部的流綫化己被成功地應用於幾艘巨大的外尖輪船。新式小艇有裝置飛機推進器者。不久將行駛於德國内河中。此種小艇於空氣阻力特加注意。經工程師加以流綫化以備空中應用的形體。用之於水上低速度行駛。己臻於有效的流綫化了。但在應用高速度時。阻力的情形便大不相同。每小時行駛一百英里的小艇。其所受阻力。一如每小時疾行一千三百英里的飛機所受者。</p>
<p>流綫化在今日殆己成爲工程界所共同注意的事物。流綫化用途極廣。而其應用於尋常的汽車。似覺最含有革命的意味。假令我們的汽車加以適當的造形。則每加　汽油或可多走兩倍的路程。此事若固可能。爲什麽以前未曾實行呢</p>
<p>原因似乎是因爲自從航空器通行以後。交通器具的速度大爲增高。纔有考慮到空氣阻力的必要。又因爲多數汽車製造商誠恐流綫化車身的奇特式樣在當時未能普遍。不敢實行改造。</p>
<p>或謂流缐化在今日尙不能普遍應用。因爲狹長的流缐形體足以浪費汽車内部的地位。且使停車問題更形困難。同時某著名工程師則預言。在此後數年内。流線形汽車將通行於美國各地。並指德國己獲成績爲其預言之根據。</p>

<p>一九三二年式新車業己登塲。新舊交替。各車商莫不竭力推銷。以新問世之汽車填置己經用敝之舊車。而各汽車製造家則更努力宣傳。競述其新車之種種優點。及所改良之處。推陳出新。精益求精。以視己往之一九三一年式者。其進步及改革之處。自甚衆多。然分其大要而述之。則不出乎下列四項。即（一）動作上格外平易安靜。（二）車身及行動各部聲息减少。（三）車身及車架製作益精。駕駛上尤爲舒服。（四）速率增進。使用經濟。外觀上式樣更佳。因之一九三二年式之新車。除式樣及外觀上進少不論外。其機械結構上之進步。即爲其動作及機力傳進之優良是也。</p>
<p>汽車機械之進步。日有新奇之發展。而最近之最大進步。厥推自由吃排。其影響於汽車製造。有若從前之自動發動機及四輪制車機一般。各種新車幾於盡己採用此項自由吃排之裝置。此外數種汽車則將裝用自動接合子。具有自由吃排之功用。至於機力之傳逹。各種汽車對於此項結構。莫不顯其甚大之進步。其齒輪之調動。在在有便易流利之長處。以視年前稱爲最大進步之四種調速裝置。便捷上相去又不可以道里計矣。</p>
<p>不久之前。某汽車製造家。造成一種小車。將引擎擱置兩個橡皮柱上。名之爲「浮動力」。製造此種小車者。聞將依其方式改造於大形汽車之中。但此項新發明之構造方法。如一九三二年式新車中不及採用者。則不久之後必能加以深切之考慮。而用之於車上也。就上所述均係其犖犖大者。其他甚關重要之旁枝細節。一時無從齤述。凡今年之新車中槪引用無遺也。今姑略舉其名稱如次。如眞空電氣火花管理。眞空喞筒。用以促動風屏抺掃。自動發動機。燃料冷却裝置。及二重活瓣之構造。每一汽缸用活瓣四個。如是則速率及力量均大增加。而引擎之大小一仍其舊。並不加大。</p>
<p>除上述者外。引擎製造方面。於汽缸之壁及活瓣座等處。採用硬性之抗熱合金。鋁質之活塞引用甚廣。目下引擎中用鉛質者日見其衆。故全鋁質之汽車。不久可以見諸實現也。一九三二年式新車。其製造方面所用橡皮之處甚多。蓋取其能保持平穏。而便利於機身之動作也。汽車聲息問題。向爲汽車製造家所渴欲解决者。一九三二年式之汽車對於聲息之减除方法。己大見進步。凡摩托·車架·及車身上之種種聲息。咸己減削之至。齒輪囓合力求吻合靜易。機力之傳逹各部均加校準。故其衝擊之聲音大減。引擎後部之聲息幾於減削皆盡。其前部亦因特殊之裝置而力趨靜默。</p>
<p>車身之建築亦係特殊者。可免一切輾軋之聲。按筍之處咸用局部鍜合法。不若從前之用螺絲釘者。其他則於接置車身時。廣用橡皮爲填置之具。以避震撼而免聲音。此外汽車製造家爲保證駕車之之平穏舒適起見。復用一種駕乘管理器特色。此係某製造廠所發明。而接連即有三家仿製者。凡裝有此種管理器者。乘客</p>

<p>車架之體力亦若車身一般。大爲增道。或增其大小尺寸。或易其式樣構造。在在能使駕車者得到舒適及安全。談及外形則一九三二年式新車之改革最多。其大體均爲低平流化之形態。故散熱器之裝置亦取低形。俾作前削美觀之狀。風屏亦略向前傾。成爲優美之曲線狀。而與上下極相稱。遮陽光之眉庇。業己代以可以隨時校正之簾罩。此着對於駕駛者甚形便利。因能隨時將迎頭來之陽光遮住。即旁由來者亦可阻斷。而向前瞭望則倍形清晰。且將遮陽光之眉庇除去後。不但形式上增進美觀。即行動亦較迅速。因能减少風力之壓阻故也·至於新車前後形之相稱優美。無庸贅言。</p>
<p>新車内部之形式及美觀。咸在優良之中。但有一事可爲申言者。即新車上所用駕駛之機鈕等。咸裝置於駕駛者之正前面。如是駕車者眼光向前。即能有得手應心之妙。且其右面地位又得空出。此爲一九三二年式新車安全上之一個特點。</p>

<p>一九三二年式福特汽車。其外觀上僅在水箱方面略有更改。復因前後輪軸稍向下彎曲。使車身降低若士。其他未見有何革新。</p>
<p>至於福特汽車之内容。則改革之處甚多。其最重大者爲汽油箱位置。己由車前移至車後。考汽油箱之置於車前者。因與引擎相近。有引起火災之危險。除極小汽車。無法搬易者外。幾無有置於車前者矣。今福特汽車將汽油箱移至車後。乃使福特汽車愈與普通汽車之内容相似。至於因汽油箱位置之向後。則增設汽油唧筒藉以吸取汽油入化汽機。</p>
<p>新車之駕駛盤。爲黑色銅骨椽皮所製。盤之中央。則設有前燈小光之管理物。並在轉向機上增加一鎖。使汽車停置於路上者。益增安全。</p>
<p>新車前窗上之拭窗機。亦甚新奇。該機係利用引擎吸氣之功用使之運動。全機隠庇於車頂内。即汽管亦隠藏不可見。祇有開關及拭窗片露出於外。</p>
<p>引擎之潤滑系統。己加改良。即於原有潑激方法之外。復加設油喞筒給油。使機油之流行。益行活躍。</p>
<p>車輪之直徑復略縮短。但車胎之尺寸則略增大。計爲５.25×18英寸。</p>
<p>車體之長度。計增長二寸半。故兩門轎車之車門甚寛。乘客之欲進入車内後座者。無須將前府之椅背撳下。故進出殊稱便利。</p>
<p>變速機之内容。亦稍改革。其第二擋之齒輪。係採用常嚙式。變速甚簡便。使用時亦穏靜不噪。福特引擎之内容。除增加汽油及機油唧筒各一具外。完全無改革。電氣組内之蓄電池。係八十安培量。</p>
<p>在英國製造之福特汽車。計有二種。一爲八匹馬力之小福特汽車。一爲大福特汽車。而後者復分爲大力小力兩種。除引擊之馬力大小不同外。其底盤各部完全相同。在英國之售價。兩門轎車售一百八十鎊。四門轎車售二百二十五鎊。如購小馬力車。則須另加五鎊。</p>
<p>上述大力引擎。計實馬力二十四匹。小力者計十四匹。前者在二千四百轉每分鐘之速度時。發生四十八匹馬力。後者在三千轉時。可得四十一匹馬力。</p>
<p>至於小馬力之引擎。汽油用量較省。如現今汽油箱能藏汽油十一加侖者。可行二百七十英里。但大馬力者僅可行二百四十英里云。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Important Points for Preventing Floods Now <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of last year's incessant rains, this reporter wrote an article urging the government and the people to quickly implement preventative measures. Unfortunately, no action was taken, resulting in devastating floods that engulfed states and submerged counties. Fields and houses in more than ten provinces were half-submerged, and the lives and properties of fifty million people were swept away. The severity of the disaster was unprecedented in a century. Even now, recalling it sends shivers down our spines.</p>
<p>The past is gone. Now, in Hankou, since the beginning of the month, the weather has been overcast with continuous rain, and the river's flow has been visibly overflowing daily. The general public is harboring anxieties about another potential flood. The Wutai Sluice Gate in Wuchang has recently been reported to be in danger, and the construction of the Zhang Gong Dike, which is crucial for the safety of Hankou, has been suspended for a long time. With disaster looming, we cannot help but tremble at the prospect of the future.</p>
<p>On April 16th, Xin Bosen of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee arrived in Hankou to inspect the disaster situation. There are still 300,000 disaster victims in Hubei Province urgently in need of relief. Currently, many are filling their stomachs daily with grass roots mixed with wheat, and they only eat once a day. Due to indigestion, many are falling ill, which is a major concern. It is also heard that in the Hubei region, tree bark is also being sold at a price of over one hundred cash per catty. Others have fled to all directions, wandering and displaced, with yellow faces, emaciated and gaunt appearances, which is a common sight. Villages and hamlets are deserted, and fields are barren. Even if there is a bumper harvest this year, it will be difficult to restore the vitality. How can we allow further wounds to be inflicted on already suffering flesh? If we do not take preventative measures early this time and allow the floods to wreak havoc again, will any survivors remain?</p>
<p>Regarding last year's floods, we stated, "The disaster was not sent by Heaven; the responsibility lies entirely with people." In today's world of advanced science, if we cannot prevent it beforehand or rescue it afterward, and this happens again and again, ultimately leading to perpetual famine, it is a disgrace to the nation and a pain to the people. Once is already too much; how can we tolerate seeing it happen again?</p>
<p>The Netherlands is just a small, low-lying country where most of the land is below sea level. However, with windmills constantly turning and ditches flowing smoothly, the occurrence of floods is rare. This means that geographical infrastructure is sufficient to control the force of water. Furthermore, regulating rainfall can be achieved through afforestation. Recent reports indicate that the Soviet Union has invented mechanisms for dispersing snow and creating rain, thus controlling the weather and preventing floods before they even occur. Why is our country so dull and unaware of this?</p>
<p>If it is said that the national treasury is empty, large sums of money are readily given away to others, often in the tens of thousands. Why is this not possible when it comes to preventing floods? Furthermore, the government has recently been striving to build cities for visual appeal. Nanjing has magnificent architecture, and Xi'an is also reporting the construction of grand government offices. The government's palaces are indeed tall and beautiful, but faced with the desolation and scattered villages, if there is no active effort to restore them, how can we bear to sit idly by and watch the floods strike again, completely sweeping everything away with the giant waves? We earnestly hope that the government will learn from the mistakes of the past year and immediately begin taking preventative measures. This is what the nation's lifeline and the people's lives depend on. The government must not remain dull and sit idly by, leading the nation to an irreversible disaster.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Inspection of Wusong and Zhabei</p>
<p>Today's Takeover of Wusong and Baoshan</p>
<p>The invading Japanese army in Shanghai has been continuously withdrawing under orders, and the number of Japanese troops remaining in Shanghai is less than half. The Japanese government had previously ordered the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai within one month. On the 10th of this month, the Japanese representative of the Joint Committee formally notified all committee members, including our representatives, and indicated that the withdrawal date would likely not exceed one month. According to official news, the Japanese side has decided to completely withdraw its troops stationed in Shanghai by June 2nd. The aforementioned withdrawal locations include the temporary locations in Zhabei, Yinhang, Yinxiang, and Wusong, as decided by the Subcommittee of the Ceasefire Conference. From the 3rd of next month, only a small number of marines will remain in Shanghai, and the situation will be completely restored to what it was before January 28th. The areas that were taken over and inspected yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Yanghang and the Lion Grove Fort were taken over by our side yesterday. The takeover committee issued a public announcement yesterday afternoon regarding the takeover of Yanghang. Wang Qingtao, the first district chief of Baoshan, and Liu Yumen, the special commissioner of this committee, reported upon their return to the committee in the afternoon that they departed from the committee at 9:00 AM this morning to Yanghang to negotiate with the commander of the Japanese garrison, Itazu. By 11:00 AM, both parties had signed and stamped the transfer documents. At that time, committee members from various countries and our representative Wen Yingxing were present to supervise. The Japanese troops completely withdrew at 12:00 PM noon, and 70 of our police officers were immediately deployed to guard the area. The area has been peaceful since the takeover.</p>

<p>The Japanese troops in the Wusong and Baoshan area are scheduled to withdraw at 11:00 AM this morning. Yesterday, our takeover committee sent personnel to inspect. The news of today's takeover is recorded below. The personnel for today's handover include the Japanese successors and our receivers. It has been decided that the Japanese successor for Baoshan County is Major Lotus, and our receiver is Sun Xiweng. The Japanese successor for the Sanguantang Ammunition Depot is also Major Lotus, and our receiver is Song Lichen. The Japanese successor for the Wusong Fort is Major Yoshitome, and our receiver is Chen Wenyu. The Japanese successor for the Fort Barracks is Major Yoshitome, and our receiver is Cao Jinggou. The Japanese successor for Wusong Town is Major Tokisawa, and our receiver is Police Officer Li. The handover ceremony will likely be held simultaneously at the Fisheries School.</p>

<p>The Japanese troops in the entire Wusong Town area, except for the temporary garrison areas designated in the ceasefire agreement, are scheduled to withdraw at 11:00 AM this morning, and our side will send personnel to take over. To prepare in advance, the takeover committee sent personnel yesterday to Wusong at 8:00 AM, together with relevant agencies, to negotiate with the Japanese troops and conduct a detailed inspection of the damaged areas. The details of the process are compiled below.</p>

Yin Tixin, Police Officer Li, Tao Xiaojie, and Tang Chengzong were assigned to negotiate all handover matters with the Japanese side today. All inspectors gathered at the Lianshe Takeover Committee at 7:10 AM and departed together by car at 8:15 AM.</p>

<p>After the inspection personnel left the Lianshe on West Aihams Road, they traveled east to Aiduoya Road, then north along Sichuan Road, exiting Pingliang Road, following Jungong Road to Wusong, passing Yunzaobang, and arriving at the headquarters of the 7th Regiment of the Japanese Army at the Huafeng Yarn Factory at 9:15 AM. Liang Fuchu, Cha Nanqiang, Li Shengjun, and Tao Xiaojie, special commissioners of the takeover committee, Li Jing, chief of the 7th District of the Public Security Bureau, Yin Tixin, interpreter, and Tang Chengzong, of the Wusong District Municipal Committee, entered the headquarters to negotiate the handover procedures for today with the commander of the 7th Regiment, Tokisawa Naohiko. The negotiations were completed at 10:25 AM, and the commander, Tokisawa Naohiko, along with an adjutant, went to inspect the area around Wusong Station.</p>
<h3 id="e9">The Tragic State of Wusong Station <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Traveling east from the headquarters of the 7th Regiment of the Japanese Army on the banks of Yunzaobang, through the Yunzaobang Town area, the inspectors arrived at Wusong Town Station. The civilian houses around the station were completely destroyed, riddled with bullet holes. The ticket office next to the station, consisting of three small houses, was severely damaged, and the interior was especially messy, with not a single table or chair remaining. To the north of the station was a civilian education center, with walls collapsed and completely ruined. The scene was even more tragic to the south of the station. When will it be restored to its original state? It is certainly not something that can be restored overnight.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Remnants of the Seaside Hotel <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>After inspecting Wusong Station, the inspectors went to inspect the "Seaside Hotel" around 10:45 AM. The Seaside Hotel, located in a secluded seaside area, had excellent surroundings. It was established by an Englishman named Davis. When the Japanese army committed atrocities, bullets rained down on the hotel, but he did not retreat. Despite repeated warnings from the British consulate, he remained unmoved. Yesterday, when the inspectors inspected the hotel, only remnants were left. Amid the smoke, debris, and broken tiles, there was a command post, which was used by Weng Zhaoyuan, the brigade commander of the 1056th Brigade of our 19th Route Army, to direct combat. Next to the Seaside Hotel was the Wusong Customs House of the Jianghai Customs. Although the building was extremely sturdy, it was also riddled with bullet holes. Behind the Customs House was the Suitang River. There was a small house by the Suitang River, which had been reduced to ashes, leaving only a few remaining bricks.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Negotiations at the Fisheries School <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>After completing the inspection of the Seaside Hotel area, it was already 11:00 AM. The inspectors went to the Wusong Fisheries School. The school was located in the northwest corner of the Seaside Hotel and had a large campus. The 4th Battalion of the Japanese Machine Gun Corps was stationed there, and its commander was Major Yoshitome. Our people originally planned to negotiate with the battalion commander after inspecting the school to also inspect the Wusong Fort, as Major Yoshitome was responsible for the security of the Wusong Fort. However, yesterday morning, Yoshitome happened to be out. Our people waited for a long time, but he did not return. Unable to do otherwise, they abandoned the inspection of the fort and went to inspect Tongji University.</p>

<p>After leaving the Fisheries School, the inspectors went to inspect Tongji University. Many of the school buildings were destroyed by artillery fire, but they were relatively easy to repair. The school had already ordered craftsmen to begin repairs. The inspectors circled the area but did not enter the buildings to examine them in detail, as no one was in charge. The school has gardens with very serene scenery. Large and small artillery shells stand erect in the gardens, demonstrating the devastation suffered by Tongji and serving as a memorial. The inspectors left Tongji at 12:00 PM and went to the Municipal Committee office.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Telephone, Telegraph, and Electric Plants <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The inspectors from the Telephone Bureau and the Telegraph Bureau went to inspect the Telephone Bureau. The bureau was destroyed, with only the framework remaining. Many of the machines were also lost. According to Engineer Huang, who inspected the site, everything needs to be rebuilt. They will first repair the Shanghai-Wusong telephone lines and then install the machines. According to Tao Fengshan from the Telegraph Bureau, the telegraph branch was in Zhanghuabang, where the Japanese troops had not yet withdrawn. Many of the branch's equipment was also lost. The Wusong Yaoming Electric Plant was completely destroyed because it was located in Yunzaobang. The Songyang Telephone Company was also destroyed and cannot be restored. The telegraph, telephone, and electric poles above Yunzaobang were severely damaged, and repairs will be difficult. It is likely that everything will have to be rebuilt.</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Various Aspects of Wusong District <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The entire Wusong district has a total of 10 map sections, 5,048 square li, over 7,000 households, and a population of about 40,000. The market is prosperous, and cultural institutions such as Tongji, Labor, Fisheries, Zhonggong, Merchant Marine, and other schools are gathered here. The peacekeepers include the security corps and the 7th District and its 1st and 6th sub-stations of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. This war bore the brunt of the damage, with 95% of the houses being destroyed. Of the 40,000 people who returned after the ceasefire, only 20-30% are present.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Areas Being Received Today <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The entire Wusong district occupies over 50 square li. Only one-third of the entire district is being received today, and it is divided into two locations. One location is Wusong Town, and the other is from the Sitang River in the western district of Wusong Town, eastward through Yangjiazhai, Jinjiazhai, Tongji University, Zhangjiazhai, Zhongda Medical College, to Xinma Road, northward along Xinma Road, and then to the Seaside Hotel area. All areas within Tongji University, east of Xinma Road, south of the Seaside Hotel, and west of Wusong Town, excluding the Songhu Railway, are temporary garrison areas for the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army may withdraw in the next few days, and the entire district will be restored sooner or later.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Surveying the Locations of Institutions <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Most of the original institutions in Wusong were destroyed. After Li Jing, Tang Chengzong, Zhang Yuchi, and others surveyed the area yesterday, it was decided that the 7th District Office of the Public Security Bureau would be temporarily located in the Caishen Temple (which used to be the 8th District Party Headquarters). The Municipal Office, the Security Corps, and the Farmers' Association would be located at the original site at the intersection of Dongsheng Road. The Chamber of Commerce would remain on Guizhi Road. The Caishen Temple was designated as the location for both parties to handle the handover procedures, and a reception area for handover personnel and news reporters was set up in the Dahua Building. Dong Fei was recommended by the Municipal Office, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Security Corps to handle all reception matters.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Inspection Along the Way Yesterday <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>When the Shanghai War broke out, the Wusong area was a fortress and was the focus of the enemy army's attention. Artillery and aircraft went there to bomb it every day, so most of the civilian houses were destroyed, with only 5% remaining. According to Tang Chengzong, a municipal committee member in the district, the total losses were over 4 million. When we set off yesterday, we proceeded along Jungong Road. Jungong Road was built by He Fenglin when he defended Shanghai. The road surface was high and flat. However, when we went to Wusong yesterday, the road surface was already rugged and uneven, with some sections completely destroyed. The car drove on it as if dancing. There were few Chinese residents in the civilian houses along Jungong Road. Some places were occupied by the Japanese. Japanese women were sometimes seen lingering under the low houses, or peeking out, smiling derisively. The Naval Hospital was also on the side of Jungong Road. When we went to inspect yesterday, we saw a small squad of Japanese military police stationed in the hospital, and there were many horses. The fine building was turned into a stable after being destroyed, which was truly regrettable. South of Yunzaobang was a Buddhist Layman's Forest, which has now been turned into a geisha business by the Japanese. The words "waiting area" were written large outside the door. The Layman's Forest was originally a clean place for those who converted to Buddhism, but it has been insulted by the Japanese geishas for no reason. Even if Buddha knew, he would only sigh helplessly. The so-called Shirakawa Bridge on Yunzaobang spans the river. The bridge is not very high, and the construction is also very crude. The Japanese side boasts of their achievements here, exaggerating it as a victory memorial bridge in the Shanghai War. When we saw it, we couldn't help but feel angry. Some colleagues suggested changing the name to Cai Gong Bridge (Cai Tingkai), which was applauded by everyone who heard it. After driving past Shirakawa Bridge, we arrived at the headquarters of the Japanese Army Regiment at the Huafeng Yarn Factory. Two Japanese soldiers were stationed outside the factory. Our personnel entered the factory and negotiated with the regiment for a long time before proceeding together to inspect the Seaside Hotel area in Wusong Town. During the battle at the Seaside Hotel, the hotel owner refused to leave and defended the hotel to the death. When going to Wusong, one could often see the hotel's flagpole with the British coat of arms hanging high. Yesterday, however, it was different. Only remnants remained, and even the flagpole was gone. Only one-tenth of the residents of Wusong have returned recently. Since the houses were all destroyed, they had no choice but to build temporary thatched huts by the roadside, with several families living in them. Their suffering</p>

<p>Need not be said. Some people built new houses among the ruins, but they were mostly simple and crude, just enough to shield them from the wind and rain. After the war, people's livelihoods were difficult, and all kinds of recovery efforts had to rely on the government. The inspection of various places was completed at 12:10 PM, and we returned together. Along Jungong Road, Japanese engineers were dismantling military telephones, and the Japanese side was preparing to depart urgently. When we inspected the area yesterday, we felt that the Japanese side's military equipment was something that our side could never hope to match. Just the military telephones alone had sturdy and exquisite poles, surpassing our country's commercial telephone poles. The Japanese military transport vehicles were also sturdy and fast, far beyond the reach of our 19th Route Army, which fought to resist Japan. From this, we can imagine how painful and difficult the battles of the 19th Route Army were.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Yesterday Afternoon's Inspection of Zhabei <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>At 11:15 AM yesterday morning, Yin Rugeng, chairman of the takeover committee, and committee members Guo Dehua and Zhu Xibai, and Secretary Li Mu, departed by car to Zhabei to inspect the local security, transportation, and sanitation conditions after the takeover. They first went to the Hubei Office of the Public Security Bureau to inspect and found that all places inside the office were swept clean. Director Huang Ming was out on official business. A district member then led the way on a motorcycle, inspecting in detail the most heavily destroyed areas along the roads. Then, they went to the 5th District, asking about the security, transportation, sanitation, and other conditions in the area, and obtaining accurate answers on the map. Then, He Yiming, the 5th District Chief, and others led the way on motorcycles, turning out of the North Railway Station for a week-long inspection. They then traveled along Baoshan Road, passing the ruins of the Commercial Press, and arrived at the intersection of Donghengbang Road for inspection. After ensuring that the defenses were properly deployed, they turned into West Baoxing Road, crossed the Yokohama River, along Liuying Road, crossed the Yokohama River again, turned into Pushan Road, and returned via Datong Road, crossing the railway. It was already 1:30 PM.</p>

<p>Postal workers in Pingjin and other places went on strike yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the postal workers' strike. Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry and Commerce, and Xiao Zhongzhen, member of the Central People's Movement Committee, were specially sent to Shanghai to discuss solutions with all parties and mediate the situation. All sectors also made informal contacts with the postal workers yesterday to conduct mediation. Zhong Shigang, director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, returned to Beijing yesterday to report that postal workers in various places responded one after another. Postal workers in Pingjin and Hebei have already started strikes, and the situation is becoming more extensive. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Xie Peilin and Zhang Rongchang, directors of the Shanghai Postal Administration, issued a circular to all employees yesterday, stating that they were instructed by the director to address the current labor movement through peaceful methods. If this is not effective in the shortest possible time, severe measures will be taken. All employees of this bureau should resume work immediately and work together to fulfill their responsibilities to the country and society. The Shanghai Postmaster is instructed to notify all subordinate employees and submit a list of the names and titles of employees who return to work and those who do not, so that the situation can be assessed in the future and rewards and punishments can be given accordingly. Therefore, this is specifically notified to all employees to return to Shanghai to work as soon as possible to avoid inconvenience.</p>

<p>The Shanghai United Rescue Association of various groups sent a letter to the Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Workers' Association yesterday, stating that regarding the strike event of your association, this association telegraphed the government on the 23rd, requesting that the government accept your association's suggestions as much as possible. The original text was published in various newspapers. Now, the Public Concession and the Japanese have each set up so-called interim post offices, which this association is infinitely alarmed by, because the recovery of foreign post offices will be soon. If this strike results in the restoration of foreign post offices, what sorrow will your gentlemen bear? We sincerely hope that you will pay close attention to this and provide urgent and effective relief. This is addressed to the Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Workers' Association, from the Shanghai United Rescue Association of various groups.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Municipal Government Proclamation of Admonition <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government received instructions from the Executive Yuan yesterday to admonish postal employees to abide by laws and regulations, share the difficulties of the times, and resume work immediately. A special proclamation was issued, stating that the Executive Yuan instructed that the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Workers' Association held a strike at 5:00 AM on the 22nd of this month. According to Article 3 of the Trade Union Law, employees and hired workers of national administrative, transportation, military, and state-owned industrial agencies shall not organize trade unions by invoking this law, and Article 23 states that trade unions organized by workers in the various undertakings listed in Article 3 shall not declare strikes. Article 37 states that the competent authority may dissolve a trade union when it has any of the following circumstances: (1) The basic requirements for existence are not met; (2) The violation of laws and regulations is serious, disrupting order or harming public interest. Now, the Shanghai postal employees, disregarding laws and regulations during the serious situation and national crisis, hold strikes to coerce, which has a serious impact on the country and society. The government should immediately instruct the competent authority to deal with it according to law. The mayor is instructed to earnestly persuade the postal employees to resume work immediately, and the government will consider and handle the suggestions regarding postal affairs. If they are still unaware, the government will have to implement strict measures to protect national transportation agencies, maintain order, and promote public interest. The order must be obeyed and not violated. Therefore, it is hereby announced that postal employees who hold strikes are violating the law, and especially at this time of national crisis and local unrest, it is likely to endanger the country. In accordance with the foregoing order, this proclamation must be issued immediately, and the postal employees must abide by laws and regulations, share the difficulties of the times, and resume work immediately.</p>

<p>Regarding postal suggestions, they should wait quietly for the government to resolve them and not violate them, lest inconvenience occur. This is urgent and important.</p>

<p>Public Concession Notification No. 4237 (for handling emergency postal affairs) on collecting and sending export postal items states that starting from 9:30 AM on Tuesday, May 24, 1932, an emergency postal service will be attached to the bureau's building, but it is limited to sending export mail. The office will be located in Room 286 on the second floor of the bureau, with entrances and exits at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road. Postage can only be paid with separately issued vouchers, according to the following methods: A. The emergency postal office sells postage voucher books, priced at one yuan per five vouchers. B. Letters weighing no more than one ounce should be affixed with one postage voucher per letter. C. Letters weighing more than one ounce but not more than twelve ounces can be affixed with additional vouchers according to the attached postage chart. Letters weighing more than twelve ounces must be specially agreed upon before they can be received. D. All letters to Hong Kong or abroad can be received. E. Registered letters, regardless of weight, should be affixed with two additional postage vouchers per letter. F.

<p>All sectors believe that the establishment of a temporary post office by the Public Concession impairs national sovereignty and have expressed opposition. This reporter specifically went to the Strike Committee to inquire about their opinion on this matter. According to the person in charge of the committee, the two committees cannot agree in principle to the establishment of a temporary post office. However, since the establishment of the bureau is temporary, we hope that the government will automatically wake up and accept the solid postal plan as soon as possible. Then, after the post office resumes work, the bureau will be canceled, and it will not be a problem.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng, in an effort to swiftly resolve the postal worker strike, has proposed a compromise. According to our reporter's inquiries with the central authorities, the details are as follows: Regarding the demands of the postal workers, (1) concerning the merger of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, as it pertains to the national administrative system, changes cannot be easily made. (The reason) The Savings and Remittance Bureau is of great importance to the livelihoods of ordinary people and has the nature of a postal bank. With the postal service as guarantor, the business it conducts is not limited to the postal sector. (2) Subsidies for the China National Aviation Corporation will remain as they are. (The reason) Subsidies for the aviation corporation are necessary for the sake of developing China's aviation future. Cancellation is practically impossible. (3) Regarding all issues concerning the postal workers themselves that require improvement or reform, the Ministry of Communications will organize a Postal Affairs Research Committee to accept the workers' demands to the extent possible. (4) The above compromise solution will only be discussed further after the postal workers resume work.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 24th (Special Dispatch) - Wang, regarding the Shanghai postal strike, telegraphed Pan Gongzhan and Wu Kaixian to come to Nanjing to discuss remedial measures. Pan and Wu offered two suggestions: (1) The establishment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau was approved by the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the law. The current demand by Shanghai postal workers to abolish it concerns national administration, and the Ministry has no authority to unilaterally change the system. The labor union can be immediately instructed to petition the Legislative Yuan directly. If the Legislative Yuan allows for changes to the regulations, the Ministry will have no problem. (2) Subsidies for aviation expenses should be limited. Based on actual needs, specify how much to allocate each month. If the limit is exceeded, the Ministry of Communications can petition the government, and the Ministry of Finance can disburse the funds. Wang greatly approved of this and immediately relayed it to the Ministry of Communications, sending representatives, along with Pan and Wu, to Shanghai to persuade the workers. They are scheduled to depart on the 24th. Gan Naiguang visited Wang on the 23rd to inquire about domestic policy. Wang Jingwei stated that the central government has decided to resolve the Shanghai postal strike in two parts: (1) Telegraphically order a swift resumption of work while awaiting a resolution. (2) If the former cannot be fulfilled, the government will use strict measures to resolve the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Ministry of Communications Hosts Press Conference <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Special Dispatch) - The Ministry of Communications hosted a press conference on the morning of the 24th, inviting over seventy members of the press. Vice Minister Yu Feipeng began by reporting that since the establishment of the Chinese postal service, employees have always been treated very well. Employees have served for many years, and things have always been peaceful. Since the emergence of labor unions, however, there has been one wave of unrest after another, with hardly a peaceful year. Before the Shanghai strike, the employees made the following demands: (1) Postal savings, with the postal service as guarantor, must be handled exclusively by postal personnel; otherwise, the word "postal" should not be included in the name of the Savings and Remittance Bureau. (2) Savings and remittances handled by post offices in various locations should not have their profits counted as income of the Savings and Remittance Bureau. (3) The Savings and Remittance Bureau is a redundant organization and should not be separated from the postal service; it should be abolished immediately. The Ministry deemed the demands unreasonable, inconsistent with the facts, and that the overall interests of the nation could not be subject to arbitrary changes based on the private views of a few. Therefore, they were not accepted, and explanations were provided. The reasons for the explanations have already been reported in the press. The current strike has been brewing for a long time. To safeguard the interests of the nation, the Ministry has tried its best to accommodate every consideration. For example, the rice subsidy was originally a temporary measure. Employees with lower salaries received a rice subsidy of two yuan per month, which was reasonable. However, even those with salaries as high as five or six hundred yuan also received it. High-salaried employees did not necessarily need this small amount, but when considering all 30,000+ employees, it would cost an additional 800,000+ yuan per year, which was too large a burden. Therefore, it was proposed to abolish it to save money. However, after the employees expressed their difficulties, a compromise was reached: the subsidy would not be canceled for those with monthly salaries below 80 yuan. As for limiting the number of postal workers at each level, it was originally intended to ensure a definite budget, but at their request, the restriction was temporarily suspended. If expanding the business required it, the number of employees could still be increased. However, the employees were still not satisfied and proposed the so-called "consolidation of the postal base." According to investigations, the total savings in the Savings and Remittance Bureau nineteen years ago was over 12 million yuan. After separation, it increased to over 24 million yuan in the twentieth year. The total amount of drafts developed was over 13 million yuan before separation, and over 16 million yuan after separation. Business development can be verified by these figures. As for aviation, it is a new and emerging industry, and the people in the border provinces have an urgent need for it. In the China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, our side holds 1.5 million in capital, to be paid in ten years. The annual amount included in the postal budget is about one million, purely for the purpose of paying for the share capital, and is not a subsidy. There was never an annual subsidy of over 3 million yuan. Furthermore, the so-called "independent postal administration" is incomprehensible. Is it independent for the benefit of the nation, or is it independent from the government and the Ministry of Communications? Postal accounting has always followed the same method as telecommunications and railways. What is meant by "special" in this case? All of these things are beyond the bounds of law and reason. At a time when the nation is in crisis, they are using strikes as a threat because their demands have not been met, undermining the nation's interests, impacting order and security, and giving foreigners an excuse to encroach on postal rights. This is extremely regrettable. However, it is still hoped that they will quickly realize their mistake, listen to the advice of the central government's special representatives and the municipal authorities, as well as the newly appointed Director of the Postal Administration, and resume work immediately to avoid losses for all parties. Chen Fumu then reported that the reason for the increase in postal rates was that international mail was shipped by foreign ships. From the 17th year of the Republic to the present, shipping costs have increased by 70 percent. Employees have received salary increases for many years, totaling over 10 million yuan. However, the increase in expenses has not been equal to the development of the business, so how could it not suffer losses, and how could it not seek to make up for them? Furthermore, due to the need to expand the business, such as adding offices, increasing rural postal services, and other equipment, it was necessary to find ways to increase revenue. Therefore, it was proposed to increase postal rates, which would increase revenue by over 9 million yuan per year, which would be just enough to cover the above-mentioned needs and create a balanced budget. However, due to opposition from all parties, it was necessary to abandon the proposal and only increase rates by half. In the future, it will only be possible to make up for accumulated losses and there will be no new construction to speak of. The surplus of the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau, 550,000 per month, is transferred to the postal service. If it were not for the Savings and Remittance Bureau's contribution, the postal service would probably be bankrupt. Currently, the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau has 5 million in cash besides investment in other businesses. The postal service does not seek to increase revenue and reduce expenditure to reorganize the business, but instead extracts funds from the Savings and Remittance Bureau on a monthly basis. Does it really intend to use up all of this cash within seven months of this year? The postal service is a state-run enterprise, and its employees are government-appointed officials. The labor law clearly stipulates that government civil servants are not allowed to organize labor unions, nor do they have the right to strike. This extraordinary action has had a huge impact, and the government already has appropriate measures to deal with it.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Labor Union Cables Minister <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The two labor unions cabled Chen Mingshu, stating: "To Minister Chen of the Ministry of Communications, Nanjing. Since the recovery of postal rights, the postal service has been affected by poor politics and has been deteriorating daily. Your Excellency previously served as the leader of Guangdong, with a distinguished political reputation. Last year, you were appointed to manage communications, and our associations were deeply pleased for the future of the postal service. Recently, in light of the postal service's near-bankruptcy, which cannot be remedied by increasing postal rates alone, we have ventured to present a plan to consolidate the postal base, requesting its adoption and implementation, so that the postal base may be permanently secure, to live up to your Excellency's expectations for reforming the postal service, and to fulfill the duties of employees. Unexpectedly, rumors have spread, blocking our voices and preventing our associations' sincere efforts to serve the postal service from reaching the top. Therefore, we have been forced to resort to the ultimate action. Our associations are in a state of extreme grief. For the present, we can only ask Your Excellency to discern the truth and make a decisive decision to accept our humble suggestions and promote their realization. Not only will the 30,000+ postal workers be eternally grateful, but the people of the entire nation will also offer fervent prayers. These are our heartfelt words, and we pray for your consideration and acceptance. Respectfully, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union."</p>

<p>Postal workers began a general strike at 5 AM on the 24th. The Management Bureau and 20 branch offices were completely sealed. At the same time, a strike committee was established, with 19 members responsible for handling affairs. During this period, all activities were conducted, and three transportation and maintenance guerrilla teams were organized, responsible for guarding the gates, transmitting news, and distributing leaflets. On the 24th, the strike committee issued an order to all employees to leave their posts and go home, awaiting instructions from the committee. During the strike, they were to remain calm and ensure that public order was not disturbed. Anyone found plotting unlawful acts would be severely punished. The Postal Workers' Union issued a declaration on the 24th, stating that in order to consolidate the postal base and protect the livelihoods of postal workers, they vowed to unite with the postal workers in North China, act as the vanguard of the people, and take consistent action with the Shanghai union to implement the strike. The union also submitted a petition to Zhang Xueliang, explaining the course of the strike and their plight, requesting forgiveness and sympathetic assistance. On the 24th, the union telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, hoping that it would quickly adopt and implement their demands to prevent the situation from escalating. Postal bureaus in other provinces and cities telegraphed Beijing, stating that they would implement the strike at noon on the 24th.</p>

With the Shanghai war just ended, order not yet restored, and the war zone preparing for reconstruction, the business community is settling accounts. Transportation services, in particular, cannot be suspended for even a day. Our Chamber previously telegraphed the government regarding the increase in postal rates, strongly advocating for a reduction. We have also telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to adopt the postal workers' suggestions, believing that the welfare of society requires that burdens be light and efficiency be high. However, the postal workers, because the government has failed to accommodate their demands, have implemented a strike, and the impact has caused nationwide anxiety. Delaying a decision will have serious consequences. We urge the government to take swift action and fully adopt the postal workers' good-faith suggestions. We also hope that the postal workers will prioritize the nation and society and resume work immediately. We especially hope that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters will guide and assist in resolving the situation. We are sincerely praying for this. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3 id="e43">Statement from the Savings and Remittance Bureau <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency reported that yesterday, the person in charge of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau made a statement to reporters, saying that the postal workers' demand to abolish the Savings and Remittance Bureau concerns the national administrative system. Whether or not to abolish it is a matter for the central government to resolve, and the Bureau has no position to take. However, there are still several misunderstandings in the outside world, and the Bureau must clarify them. (1) Postal employees believe that the separate establishment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau is the sole reason for the postal service's losses. In fact, the separation of the Savings and Remittance Bureau is completely unrelated to the postal service's losses. Apart from the Savings and Remittance Bureau being the hub for planning and promoting savings and remittance services, and the three branches in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou being the backbone for managing savings, all postal districts executing the orders of the Savings and Remittance Bureau to handle savings and remittance matters are still the postal service and its employees. The total annual expenditure of the Savings and Remittance General Bureau and its branches is only 639,661 yuan (accurate figure for the 19th year of the Republic). The progress of the savings and remittance business, combined with the total amount of savings and remittances, has increased significantly compared to before. Even if it is considered that the Savings and Remittance Bureau has no achievements and it is decided to abolish and merge it, the savings will only be over 600,000 yuan (in fact, it is less than this amount, because there are still some postal workers in the Savings and Remittance General Bureau and its branches who will still have to be paid by the post office after the merger). May we ask how much the postal service loses each year and whether saving this small amount can make up for it? Furthermore, the net profit of the Savings and Remittance Bureau is not transferred for other uses. According to regulations, after setting aside 30% for public reserve, it is still transferred to the postal service general bureau's account for use. In the 19th year of the Republic, because the postal service had more losses, the Bureau transferred all of its surplus of over 5,670,000 yuan to the postal service. Postal employees should all know this, but they still say that the separate establishment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau is the main reason for the postal service's losses, which is completely contrary to reason. (2) It is said that the Ministry of Communications established the Savings and Remittance Bureau to facilitate the withdrawal of funds. This point is even more unfounded. The Postal Service General Bureau and the Savings and Remittance General Bureau are both completely subordinate to the Ministry of Communications and must obey the Ministry of Communications' orders. If the Ministry of Communications wants to withdraw funds, there is no difference between the Postal Service General Bureau and the Savings and Remittance General Bureau. In fact, the Ministry of Communications has never withdrawn funds from the Bureau. There are records to verify this. Recently, the Bureau's Supervisory Committee has been established and has hired an accountant to audit the accounts. There will be a formal report in the future that can be used as proof.</p>

<p>Since the strike of the postal offices in this city, the China National Aviation Corporation, in order to maintain smooth communications, has devised ways to collect and send airmail as usual. It is reported that yesterday, those who went to the company to post were extremely crowded, and all the company's personnel were insufficient. Therefore, starting today, all airmail will be collected and sent by the wired telegraph offices and wireless telegraph offices in this city, as well as the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Declaration from the Press Labor Union <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Press Labor Union's Declaration on the Postal Workers' Strike states: "The resounding Shanghai postal workers' strike has finally erupted after brewing for some time. The long-term and short-term causes of this strike have been reported in detail from all sides. From these many detailed reports, we clearly understand that this postal workers' strike is entirely out of a desire to protect the postal service and to fight to save it. We express our deepest sympathy for this selfless and brave spirit of sacrifice. But unfortunately, as we carefully review the situation over the past three days, we cannot help but feel frightened. Why? Look at the disruption of news from various places due to the strike. Anyone who deeply understands the reasons for this strike can see this. However, imperialists, under the guise of 'maintaining the free flow of news', have begun preparing to seize postal rights. If this preparation expands along with the expansion of the postal strike, then we dare to predict that the entire Chinese postal rights will be handed over to the tiger's mouth, and there will be no way to save them. At this time, in the postal workers' subjective view, they are indeed striking to save the postal service, but objectively, they have achieved the opposite result. Therefore, although we express twelve points of sympathy for this postal workers' strike in principle, if it continues to be prolonged under the current circumstances, the result may be more harmful than beneficial. Fortunately, since the strike, the authorities have expressed their willingness to fully accept the demands put forward by the postal workers, but the plan to save the postal service still needs to be discussed later. Now that the postal workers' own demands can be resolved, there is no chance that postal rights will fall into the hands of the tiger. Therefore, this strike no longer needs to be prolonged or expanded. We hope that the discerning postal workers and compatriots from all walks of life across the country will pay attention to this. Then China will be fortunate, and the future of the postal service will be fortunate. We hereby declare. Shanghai Press Labor Union."</p>
<h3 id="e46">Declaration from Various Industry Labor Unions <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Various Industry Labor Unions' Declaration on the Postal Workers' Strike states: "This time, the postal workers, because the Ministry of Communications did not adopt their plan to consolidate the postal base, went on strike the other day. We believe that this postal workers' strike is to protect the postal service and to reduce the burden on all Chinese people, not for the benefit of the postal workers themselves. Therefore, for this postal workers' strike, we, standing on the side of the working class and the people of the entire society, deeply express twelve points of sympathy and attention. However, the target of this postal workers' strike is not the capitalist but the Ministry of Communications. But the Ministry of Communications is a government agency, so how this postal workers' strike can be resolved is related to the government's policy on the postal service and has a profound relationship with the transportation order of all Chinese people. However, at this time when the nation is facing a crisis, and the government's administration is dealing with countless problems, it should be able to take care of the social traffic order and sincerely accept the postal workers' proposal. We, standing on the side of society, at this time when the anti-Japanese war has just ended, and all industries are reviving, the postal workers' strike has a very large impact. We sincerely hope that the postal workers can take care of the social traffic order and not expand this unfortunate incident, and that it can be resolved quickly so that it will not hinder the postal service because of the protection of the postal service, and it will not affect the traffic order of the people, especially after the postal workers' strike, the Public Works Department took the opportunity to establish a temporary postal service to replace it. Its purpose is to facilitate traffic, which is a good idea, but it has a very large relationship and hidden concerns about the sovereignty of our postal service and the interests of the postal workers themselves. We hope that our government and postal workers pay attention to this. We hereby solemnly declare this."</p>

<p>To all newspapers, groups, and compatriots across the country: The country is facing a crisis, foreign aggression is imminent, and strong neighbors are watching. The country has already fallen into a critical autumn, and bandits are rampant, and the people are in a state of misery. The situation is more serious than this. All of our government and people should work together to overcome difficulties. The two postal workers' unions suddenly went on strike because of the plan to consolidate the postal base, and the impact is unspeakable. Our associations deeply sympathize with the union's original intention of loving the postal service and saving the postal service. However, at this time when the country is in danger, and new creations are heavy, we must pray that the situation will not expand again, that disputes will be resolved as soon as possible, so that society will not be disturbed and foreigners will have an excuse. We also hope that the authorities will adopt the various proposals put forward by the postal workers as appropriate. Society is fortunate, and the party and country are fortunate. In order to maintain local order and consolidate the labor movement, our associations must unite and rectify our internal affairs, and not participate in any movements that disrupt society.

<p>His Condition Improved Slightly After Surgery Yesterday</p>
<p>But His Life Remains Highly Perilous</p>
<p>Japanese Commander Shirakawa Yoshinori's condition deteriorated and, by yesterday dawn, he was unconscious and barely breathing, gradually entering a terminal state. At 8 AM, doctors performed another blood transfusion, and his condition temporarily improved. At that time, Dr. Goto examined Shirakawa's condition and had performed ten blood transfusions, but the vomiting of blood and bloody stools continued to persist. If his condition was allowed to progress naturally, he would not be able to survive the night. Therefore, it was decided to perform surgery in the hope of a slight chance of survival. Goto then anesthetized Shirakawa locally at 11:30 AM and personally performed the operation, opening Shirakawa's abdomen. A cancerous tumor, the size of a fist, was found in the duodenum. The tumor was cut off and removed. The surgery took about an hour. After the surgery, the vomiting of blood and bloody stools stopped suddenly, and his consciousness was relatively stable. However, he was still unable to eat anything. Doctors said that he had a glimmer of hope. If there are no more changes within the next day or two, he may be able to escape danger. However, his life is still highly perilous at the moment. At 11:30 PM last night, the chief military doctor of the Japanese Army Hospital examined Shirakawa and saw that his complexion had returned to normal. The military doctor then announced to the outside world that Shirakawa would be able to safely spend the night. Outside, there were rumors about Shirakawa's death, saying that he had died at 11 AM the day before and that the Japanese side was secretly not announcing it. In fact, Shirakawa is still hovering between life and death, and the claim that he is dead is not yet true. His will was verbally given to Chief of Staff Tashiro on the 19th, who recorded it and established it.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Shanghai, 24th, a slight pause. At 10 AM today, the Shanghai Expeditionary Force Medical Department announced Shirakawa's condition at 6 PM on the 23rd: temperature 37.6 degrees Celsius, pulse 108, respiration 20. The condition at 6 AM on the 24th: temperature 36.6 degrees Celsius, pulse 120, respiration 24. The condition at 5 PM: temperature 37.6 degrees Celsius, pulse 108, respiration 18. Black and reddish liquid stool was passed twice last night at 9 PM and 10 PM. Hemostatic injections were given, and 200 grams of blood were transfused. Although he entered a state of lethargy last night, he would sleep and wake up, which was very painful. From 6 AM to 7 AM this morning, he continued to pass black liquid stool three times. The degree of anemia has increased, and his physical strength is gradually decreasing. His pulse is gradually deteriorating, and the power of his heart is also gradually weakening. His life is already in a worrying state. Another blood transfusion was performed at 8 AM.</p>

<p>Service Resumes on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Yesterday</p>
<p>Trains Departed from Shanghai Once in the Morning and Once in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Today’s Train Schedule Remains the Same as Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 24th), due to the complete repair of the tracks and other infrastructure along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, Director Chen Xinghan and Chief of the Transportation Department Zheng Baozhao urgently ordered the resumption of passenger train services. However, due to the limited number of trains, only two direct passenger services to Nanjing were initially operated. The first train departed at 11:00 AM, stopping at all stations along the route. A total of 237 third-class tickets and 8 second-class tickets were sold, generating a total revenue of $264.46. The second train departed at 3:45 PM, operating as a special express train, stopping only at Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Danyang, and Zhenjiang. A total of 283 second and third-class tickets were sold, generating a total revenue of $822.14. Director Chen Xinghan and Chief Zheng Baozhao personally oversaw all operations at the station throughout the day. Today, passenger train services will continue to operate in the same manner, with the first train departing at 11:33 AM. Additionally, due to the ongoing clearance work at each station and the lack of storage space, passengers are requested to collect their luggage immediately upon arrival to prevent loss. The Engineering Department is working day and night to clear and dismantle the original sites of the damaged stations. At 9:00 AM today, Director Chen Xinghan and Chief of the Transportation Department Zheng Baozhao will take a special train to inspect the tracks, bridges, telephone communications, and other infrastructure at each station between Kunshan. They are expected to return to Shanghai at approximately 4:00 PM. Director Chen Xinghan of the two railway bureaus is scheduled to host a visit for reporters from various newspapers and news agencies to Zhenru, Nanxiang, and other locations at 9:00 AM today. The gathering will take place at the United Press Office before 9:00 AM, with departure scheduled for 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, after the resumption of service on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway yesterday, the train from Nanjing to Shanghai also arrived yesterday. The first train was the 7:00 AM early train, originally scheduled to arrive at the North Station at 4:44 PM. However, due to the recent completion of repairs on the tracks and bridges east of Kunshan, the train's speed was slightly reduced, and it arrived at the North Station at 5:20 PM, only 35 minutes behind schedule. The train from Nanjing to Shanghai was hauled by Pacific-type locomotive No. G57, pulling eight passenger cars. The train was extremely crowded, with approximately 800 passengers, and a large amount of luggage. Upon disembarking, passengers were delighted to see the national flag with the blue sky and white sun emblem displayed outside the station gate. Furthermore, the second train from Nanjing to Shanghai, the 8:00 PM service, also arrived on time at 9:05 PM last night. This train was even more crowded than the previous one. The gates between the North Station and the boundary road, which the foreign settlement had originally scheduled to close at 6:00 PM last night, were reopened by the railway authorities upon the train's arrival to facilitate the entry of passengers residing in the foreign settlement.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Telegram Urging Universal Impeachment of Wang <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Various People's Organizations sent a telegram to the entire nation, stating (excerpt omitted):</p>
<p>"Regarding the Control Yuan's impeachment of Wang Jingwei for illegally approving the Shanghai-Woosung Armistice Agreement, based on the National Government's Organic Law, the Legislative Yuan has the power to deliberate and decide on declarations of war, peace treaties, and other major international matters. The Executive Yuan's approval of the Shanghai-Woosung Armistice Agreement without prior review and decision by the Legislative Yuan is considered fundamentally illegal. Wang Jingwei, as the President of the Executive Yuan, should be subject to appropriate punishment for this violation. This righteous stance is clear as day. However, it is reported that Wang's side is still employing deceptive rhetoric, attempting to justify his actions by claiming that the agreement falls under administrative procedures, that there was no declaration of war and therefore no peace treaty to negotiate, and that the case was approved by the Central Political Council, negating the need for review by the Legislative Yuan. This is extremely arbitrary. The agreement is clearly based on the outcome of a war between the two countries. We ask, what is Shanghai? What is the agreement? If there was no war, why a cessation? What is the difference between a declared war and an undeclared war? Is it possible to claim that there was no war when there were 32 days of bloody conflict, with the front lines extending for 200 to 300 li? Wang Jingwei's reversal of truth, his skillful sophistry, disregard the gravity of the matter and attempt to misrepresent the situation. He is truly a scourge to the Party and the nation. Wang Jingwei relies on the Central Political Council as his supreme backing, seemingly unaware that under the clear sky and bright sun, there is no such thing as an imperial court conference. Even if there are no capable individuals in the government and all departments are filled with sycophants, one cannot claim that there is no talent to be found. His contempt for the world is excessive. Wang Jingwei's guilt of violating the law and harming the country through the approval of this agreement is fully established. To be slightly critical is to call him a traitor, which is not excessive. The people of our entire nation are sworn to resist Japan, while Wang Jingwei is sworn to ingratiate himself with Japan, daring to act improperly and remaining unrepentant. Without a unified expression, it will be impossible to awaken him. (1) All organizations should jointly request the Legislative Yuan to declare that this agreement is entirely invalid. (2) All organizations should jointly request the Control Yuan to continue its impeachment, demanding that Wang Jingwei resign from his position, retract his approval, or face appropriate legal punishment. Furthermore, the government should announce its determination to resist for the long term and supervise its implementation. The prevailing trend of decline must be reversed, discipline strengthened, and the system reformed. The nation's future may yet be salvageable. Otherwise, if the Control Yuan stands alone and the Legislative Yuan remains silent, evil precedents will be set, leading to recklessness and impunity. The Party, the nation, and the country will perish, and great disaster will befall us. This association, mindful of these concerns, has voiced its strong opposition and issued repeated telegrams since learning of the impending agreement, expressing our extreme sorrow and indignation. We reiterate our call to action, urging you not to disregard this matter as a fait accompli." (remainder omitted) Respectfully, the Shanghai Joint Association of Various People's Organizations.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Organizations and the Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association issued four telegrams yesterday in support of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e52">Telegram to Twenty-Two Chambers of Commerce <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>To the Chambers of Commerce and Bar Associations of Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Kaifeng, Xi'an, Hankou, Changsha, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, Yangzhou, Zhengzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Yantai, Zhangjiakou, and Shijiazhuang, Greetings. Since September 18th (the original text is the same as the telegram sent to military and civilian leaders of various provinces in yesterday's newspaper, omitted), your association has been at the forefront of the people, deeply committed to national salvation. We humbly request that your esteemed members lead the way in generously donating and actively promoting fundraising to support the righteous armies, which is essential for defending the entire nation. The situation is critical. We earnestly await your efforts. Respectfully, the Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Organizations and the Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association.</p>

<p>To the Chambers of Commerce and Bar Associations of Guangzhou, and forwarded to Hong Kong and Macau, Greetings. Since September 18th (excerpt omitted), Guangdong is a source of revolution, and its determination to resist Japan surpasses that of any other region.

<p>To the Chambers of Commerce and Bar Associations of Chongqing and Chengdu, Greetings. Since September 18th (excerpt omitted), Sichuan, the Land of Abundance, is easy to defend and difficult to attack. Its population and territory are comparable to those of major European powers, and its military strength and organization of the people are unparalleled in the country. If it can rise to the occasion, Sichuan alone can suppress the violent Japanese. Your association serves as a guide to the people and is universally admired. We humbly request that you rally the masses, promote widely, and prepare to use Sichuan's human and material resources to shoulder the great responsibility of saving the nation. We ask your association to carefully consider how to provide current assistance to the Northeastern Volunteer Army, so that hundreds of thousands of loyal and brave soldiers can sustain a prolonged war with the enemy, thus safeguarding the lifeblood of the nation and its people, and work together to accomplish this great cause. We look forward to good news.</p>

<p>To the Dagongbao Newspaper in Tianjin, forwarded to the National Salvation Associations, Chambers of Commerce, and Bar Associations, and to Mr. Xiong Bingzhen and Mr. Ding Muhan in Beiping, forwarded to the National Salvation Organizations, Greetings. Since September 18th (excerpt omitted), we rely on the wisdom of the nation's elite to uphold the noble cause of resisting Japan and saving the country, to lead the masses and solicit donations. We have telegraphed officials and civilians throughout the country to rise up together. Regarding fundraising in North China, we respectfully request your full support. Yan and Liaoning are interdependent, and the pain is deeply felt. You will surely anticipate the troubles of others and urgently seek to provide assistance. The life and death of the nation and the survival of the country depend on it. We earnestly await good news. Respectfully, the Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Organizations and the Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association.</p>
<h3 id="e56">National Disaster Relief Association Telegrams Requesting the Suppression of Communists and Bandits <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The National Disaster Relief Association sent a telegram to the Military Council of the National Government in Nanjing, the Governors of various provinces, the Pacification Commissioners, and military generals, stating: "Since the Japanese army invaded our territory eight months ago, the Northeast has almost fallen, and Shanghai has suffered repeated bloody battles. The entire nation is united in grief and indignation. As you command the troops and guard the frontiers, the nation looks to you with hope. It is your duty to defend the territory and strengthen the military, striving for survival. The people share this hope. Furthermore, the nation's quest for victory abroad must begin with internal stability. There can be no defeating strong enemies abroad when bandits and communists are rampant throughout the land. In recent years, communist bandits have wreaked havoc in our country, and efforts to suppress or appease them have failed. As a result, the people of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces have long suffered. Recently, half of Jiangxi Province has become a bandit zone, and they have even split into groups, attacking southern Fujian and northern Anhui. If this continues, they will surely grow stronger, and the nation will cease to exist, let alone resist foreign aggression. If you are truly motivated by love for the country and a sense of responsibility, you should seize this opportunity to vigorously suppress them, eradicating them completely. Furthermore, suppression must be done in cooperation with the people. We believe that the most urgent task is to quickly establish local militias in various places, based on the size of the villages and the number of people, organize them according to military systems, and implement training. They should be managed by impartial local gentry under the supervision of the local government, and the Party should not interfere, in order to unify authority. In peacetime, they can be used for self-defense and protection against bandits, and in times of need, they can cooperate with the official army and mobilize at any time. Their effectiveness will be far greater than distant reinforcements, which are often too late to be of use. As for the expenses, the local Party branches spend nearly a million dollars each year in each province, throwing money into a bottomless pit, which may even foster laziness and recklessness, harming the local people. These funds should be abolished and used to establish militias, so that the people can benefit and the villages can be defended. Recently, Guangxi Province has established militias throughout the province, with each team consisting of ninety people. Each county, depending on its size, trains several teams. Within a few months of their establishment, the bandit problem was eradicated. The organization of the Hunan militia is similar to that of Guangxi, and it has been recently reorganized with even better results. The fall of Changsha last year and the subsequent counterattack by the National Army, which involved fierce and bloody battles, are clear evidence of this. Now, Jiangsu has also entrusted gentry with the organization of a Defense Committee, which oversees everything and supervises the counties to actively implement the plan. Given time, it will surely be effective. At this critical juncture, when survival is at stake, we cannot afford to ignore this. The people must be able to live and work in peace before they can easily share a common hatred of the enemy, and the nation must be orderly before it can improve its politics. We urge you to be mindful of the danger of national extinction, fulfill your duty to protect the territory and the people, put aside all internal strife, suppress communists and bandits, and spare no effort. If the people's lives are hanging by a thread, they will be relieved, and if the nation's lifeline is not severed, it will gradually recover, reclaim lost territory, and resist aggression. This is the beginning. Please consider this carefully. Respectfully, the National Disaster Relief Association of the Republic of China."</p>

<p>Opinions Still Not Consistent</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, since the British Residents Association proposed that various countries hold a meeting to jointly decide the status of the International Settlement and sent letters to various foreign chambers of commerce in the city to solicit their agreement, a reporter from the Continental News specifically inquired about the opinions of the various chambers of commerce yesterday. The British and American Chambers of Commerce did not wish to express any opinion. The French Chamber of Commerce is currently considering the matter in its board of directors. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce supports the resolution drafted by the British Residents Association and sent a reply letter yesterday. The Danish Chamber of Commerce has not yet made a decision. The Italian Chamber of Commerce is still considering the matter in its board of directors and expects to make a decision next week. The Dutch Chamber of Commerce will hold a meeting this week to make a decision. A member of the Norwegian Chamber of Commerce denied the rumor reported on Saturday that the chamber supported the resolution, saying that the chamber has not yet taken any action. The Belgian Chamber of Commerce stated that not all directors are in Shanghai and will hold another board meeting in early June to make a decision.</p>

<p>Five-Member Commission Believes Only Solution to Break Deadlock</p>
<p>Administrative Committee to be Established with Zhang Xueliang as Leader</p>
<p>(Geneva) A surprising rumor emerged here today, claiming that the Lytton Commission intends to place Manchuria under the administration of the League of Nations. After considerable deliberation on all causes and effects regarding the Liaoning issue, the five members of the Commission believe that the only way to resolve the current deadlock is to place it under the jurisdiction of the League of Nations. This matter will be discussed in detail in the Commission's final report, which is to be submitted in September. As for the details of the plan, it is said that an Administrative Committee will be established with Zhang Xueliang as the leader, and representatives from Britain, France, China, Japan, or perhaps two or three other countries will serve as members. This committee will be responsible to the League of Nations. However, this rumor has not yet been verified in Geneva. Key officials in the League of Nations Secretariat have stated that they know nothing about this matter. (National News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The investigation team questioned Japanese Deputy Consul General Morishima at the Japanese Consulate yesterday regarding Japan's control over the South Manchuria Railway and leasehold rights. (Special dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Lytton Commission, including Sir Lytton, visited Japanese Consul General Morishima at the Japanese Consulate at 9:30 AM yesterday to inquire about the South Manchuria Railway and leasehold rights. They questioned the reason for negotiating with Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Xueliang instead of the central government. Morishima replied that China had never had a stable central government, and the central government's authority over the three eastern provinces had only existed since the establishment of the Nanjing government three or four years ago. Even now, the Nationalist government's influence has not fully extended to the three eastern provinces, as Your Excellency will be able to see clearly during your on-site investigation. He then explained the current situation in the three eastern provinces, Zhang Xueliang's relationship with the central government, and the railway issue, as well as other matters, based on the facts and the treaties after the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars.

<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 24th: Saito's selection of cabinet members is progressing. Today, Suzuki, President of the Seiyukai, requested that Saito include Mizuno, Takahashi, Tokonami, and Hata in the cabinet. Saito only agreed to three. Mizuno, Takahashi, and Mochizuki are Saito's preferred candidates. The Minseito Party will nominate Yamamoto Tatsuo and Machida Chuji. Araki is determined to resign, and General Hayashi will succeed him as Army Minister. General Okada is determined to be the Navy Minister. Xiang Chengzhizhu, a figure in the business world, refuses to take office and recommends Nakajima Kumakichi to join the cabinet. Ucida, Yuasa, and Nagata, three members of the Upper House, and Hiranuma, Vice President of the Privy Council, will also join the cabinet. The distribution of cabinet members is roughly as follows:</p>

<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 24th: Today's meeting of the three senior officials of the Army has decided to cooperate and support the Saito Cabinet. However, opinions on the successor of the Army Minister have not yet been unified and will be considered again tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Seiyukai Promises Assistance <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 24th: Suzuki replied to the new Prime Minister Saito today, declining to take a seat in the new cabinet but promising to support it with the Seiyukai. Therefore, the new cabinet can ensure friendly cooperation between the two major parties in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 24th: Suzuki, President of the Seiyukai, visited Saito at 9:30 this morning to ask about the Seiyukai's assistance to the new cabinet and the new cabinet's policies on: (1) the gold embargo issue; (2) rural issues; (3) Manchuria issues; (4) the current situation; (5) the fundamental policy of organization. Saito replied that specific policies could not be stated at this time. However, (1) the gold embargo has already been implemented, and efforts must be made to prevent fluctuations in the economic world and there is no intention of lifting the embargo; (2) the rural area is plagued by social problems, and efforts should be made to revitalize it; (3) the established policy on Manchuria issues will be implemented; (4) the strategy to address the current situation is to stabilize the people's hearts; (5) the cabinet's organization policy has been detailed yesterday. Mr. Suzuki immediately understood and agreed to consult with the party's leadership before clearly answering whether to assist the new cabinet or not.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 24th: During the first meeting between Saito and President Suzuki this morning, the new cabinet's policy on fiscal and economic policies largely recognized the Seiyukai's policy and reached a consensus. As a result, President Suzuki decided to order party members to join the new cabinet and provide internal and external assistance.</p>

<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 24th: Due to Saito's earnest request, Minister of Finance Takahashi decided to remain in office. Takahashi decided to take on the dramatic task despite his old age for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Prime Minister Saito is an amateur in finance, so he must have a person with skills and personality as the Minister of Finance. (2) Minister of Finance Takahashi is a figure desired by the national financial world. Since the establishment of the Inukai Cabinet, he has been proceeding according to the planned financial policy. If he resigns this time, the financial world may be in turmoil. (3) If Minister Takahashi remains in office, the Seiyukai will definitely support the new cabinet.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 24th: Last night, President Suzuki and the elders of the Seiyukai, at the meeting, Tokonami and Mochizuki insisted that in the current situation, the only way to organize a cabinet of national unity is for our party to assist the Saito cabinet. Ogawa Heikichi quoted the history of the Constitutional Protection Movement, saying that under the beautiful name of national unity, it is difficult to resolve the current situation in practice. Our party should always rely on the spirit of the founding party and strive to establish a path of party politics, and aim to overthrow the transcendental cabinet. Those who opposed it said that such a discussion, which does not understand the current situation and is stubborn and inflexible, will only make the people disbelieve the Seiyukai when dealing with the world. After several discussions, it was decided to clearly listen to the Saito Cabinet's policies and cabinet organization policy, and then hold an elders' meeting to decide whether to agree to or not.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd: German newspapers all believe that Japan's appointment of Viscount Saito as Prime Minister is a guarantee that there will be no war in the Far East. Most commentators praised his achievements, calling him a man of the talent needed to cope with difficult times, and he will definitely gain the respect and trust of the people across the country. As the German World Newspaper said, even if the Japanese regime has been seized by the military, the Saito Cabinet is unlikely to adopt extremist policies. Now its cabinet members must be the most famous figures in the country, who are not confined to party views and can implement true national policies.</p>

Only China, Italy, Germany, Russia, the Netherlands, and other 14 countries advocated for retaining the deletion. France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and others strongly advocated for deletion. Before the decision, the two sides argued fiercely. Representatives from China, Germany, Italy, and Russia all argued that dropping bombs would harm civilians and should not be allowed by humanity.</p>

The draft was drafted by the International League of Peace Enforcement. (Note: The original text of the International League of Peace Enforcement is International League of Peace Enforcement, which seems to be a different organization from the International Anti-War Congress, which called for world sympathy in the Paris telegram yesterday.

<p>Havas, Geneva, 23rd: Lord Ponsunby, President of the International Anti-War Congress, and the great German scientist Einstein, declared to the international press this afternoon that the discussion in Geneva on qualitative and quantitative disarmament is endless, which is disappointing.

<p>Maintaining All Treaty Rights</p>
<p>Indicates No Relaxation on German Reparations</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 23rd – The Paris Morning News published an interview with Mr. Herriot, widely regarded as the future Minister of Foreign Affairs. He stated that France's future foreign policy would be characterized by "extreme prudence." Mr. Herriot said in the interview that if he were to head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, his motto would be: "For every step taken, review it at least twice, or even three times, and make every decision with extreme care, not neglecting even the slightest detail." When asked about the overall direction of future diplomatic policy, Mr. Herriot stated that France must insist on all the rights it should obtain from the peace treaty and all international agreements, and he would reject any approach that did not first guarantee France's rights and interests. When asked what to do if Germany questioned France's claims, Mr. Herriot replied that if Germany believes that what it is paying exceeds what it should bear, we might invite world experts to carefully examine the various figures and statistics. However, the Young Plan was voluntarily accepted by Germany, and the figures were also voluntarily acknowledged by them. Mr. Herriot concluded by saying that France should maintain its traditional policy of peace and justice, while also avoiding any suspicion of weakness, as any concessions by France would only provide excuses for German National Socialism.</p>

<p>Famous German Detective Arrested</p>
<p>Diary Found on Person</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 23rd – A person has been arrested here, and a diary has been found on him with the words "Killer of Kitchener" written on the cover. This person was arrested in the United States in 1929 but managed to escape to Mexico by plane. British authorities are now seeking him in connection with a ship burning case. The diary found today contains a map showing the terrain of Orkney Island, with a cross drawn and the words "Kitchener killed here" written next to it. The location he marked is the site where the British ship Hampshire sank. The British ship Hampshire sank off the coast of Orkney Island, Scotland, in June 1916. At the time, Secretary of War Kitchener and his staff were on a secret mission to Russia on this ship. Unexpectedly, the ship had an accident at sea, and the cause remains unknown to this day, almost becoming a mystery. The person arrested today is said to have been a journalist and an international speculator. When South America was at war with Britain, he helped South America hate Britain. He was arrested here in 1919 for shipping several boxes on the merchant ship Denison, which was sunk en route, killing several people. Authorities suspected that the boxes contained explosives, so they arrested him. Authorities have not yet announced the person's name. Reuters, New York, 24th – It is now known that the person arrested yesterday in connection with Kitchener's death is the famous German detective Captain Dukeson. However, he insists that he was arrested by mistake.</p>

<p>Because the Party Government Relies on Zaibatsu</p>
<p>Impeding the Active Development of the Military</p>
<p>Therefore, First Overthrow the Party Government</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Daily News published an article by Xiang Hu Zhi on the 18th. The article is lengthy, and the following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>The assassination of Prime Minister Inukai, viewed from within, is not a surprising event. Why? Because the prime minister of a country, who controls the key to national affairs, is suddenly assassinated, it is naturally considered a major case. However, judging from past events in Japan, such as the attacks on former Prime Ministers Hara Takashi and Hamaguchi at Tokyo Station, although members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties were very surprised, the general public showed no shock. Furthermore, incidents such as the attacks on Yasuda Zenjiro and Dan Takuma, although related to the zaibatsu and caused great anxiety, were also ignored by the general public. Moreover, in the past, the assassination of Ito Hirobumi in Harbin, and recently the bombing of General Shirakawa in Shanghai, did not move the public at all. However, Inukai's death was different. When the news spread throughout the country, panic arose immediately. For example, the stock exchange closed, and three prefectures outside Tokyo City temporarily declared martial law. All police officers nationwide were mobilized, which was unprecedented. The death of Prime Minister Inukai, who was approaching old age, by this ruthless bullet, was certainly imaginable at the time. However, the reason for the tragedy is not in this. Therefore, we should pay considerable attention to how the future situation in Japan will evolve. The surface cause of Inukai's death was a fatal blow from a huge shadowy figure. What is this huge shadowy figure? It is the current Japanese zaibatsu and capitalists. The entire structure of our country's government today is almost entirely formed by these zaibatsu. These zaibatsu, represented by two or three people, organize the government according to their own likes and dislikes, destroy the government according to their own interests, organize political parties based on their own relationships, and dissolve political parties based on their own well-being. For example, one side formulates laws, while the other side tramples on them. The decisions are made by their contradictory wills. For example, after the fall of the Minseito cabinet, the Seiyukai cabinet followed and re-prohibited gold exports in order to buy foreign exchange and accumulate tens of millions of yuan. They gathered the elite troops of the nation and sent them to war. As soon as the troops left our country's ports, their whereabouts were unknown, but the spies of the zaibatsu had already gone there first. This is the phenomenon that the Japanese military today is always under the control of the zaibatsu. Therefore, today's political parties and the military can be said to be two pillars supporting the zaibatsu. In the past, whenever a prime minister or president was suddenly attacked, the cabinet collapsed, or a political party split, although there was temporary unease, parliamentary politics and party politics did not waver in any way. When the leader of the zaibatsu was killed, although there was a temporary loss of control, there was no undue concern among the entire capitalist class. In the recent economic situation, in this era of extreme global poverty, if the zaibatsu do not invest, military spending will have to be reduced. The political parties with the zaibatsu as their background are naturally very arrogant. As a result, the military became resentful. Judging from the circumstances of certain major incidents in the past and the suppression of the Manchurian Incident beforehand, it can be proved that the person who killed the Prime Minister this time was a soldier, and was an organized group, openly wearing formal uniforms. Judging from their intentions, it was like wanting to pour boiling water on the backs of the zaibatsu and political parties. The reason why they took this drastic measure is that the zaibatsu and political parties today regard the country as a secondary issue, in addition to their own affairs. The general public is trapped in unemployment, worrying about the economic downturn day and night, while they spend all year round in gold and jade pavilions, wine pools and meat forests, without any pity. This aroused their great injustice, and they took this drastic action. From this point of view, the root cause of Inukai's death at the hands of the military is the intention to overthrow the current structure of the national society in order to reform it. The other day, Minister of the Army Araki said, "Investigate the root cause to prevent future troubles." What is the root cause he is talking about? That is, to smash the zaibatsu who ignite the people's lifeblood and covet fine wine and nectar with a heavy hammer, and overthrow them in one fell swoop, in order to wash away the filthy dust from the foundation of the party organization.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Zhejiang Postal Workers Unite with Shanghai Postal Workers <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Implement Strike on the Morning of the 24th</p>
<p>Hangzhou News – Since the Shanghai postal workers' postal rescue movement occurred, and a strike was implemented on the 22nd, the close proximity of Shanghai and Hangzhou has had an impact. The postal workers of Zhejiang Province took unified action with Shanghai starting at 6:00 AM on the 24th. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Brief History of the Union: The Hangzhou Postal Workers Union was established in 1927 and was organized by lower-level employees. It once went on strike and fought to drive out a British局長. Later, it was suspended for some reason. Urged by the Shanghai Postal Workers General Union, it was established on December 31st of last year. All postal workers in the province have joined, and the organization is quite strict. There are a total of 135 postal branch offices in Zhejiang Province, 6 branch offices in Hangzhou City, and a total of more than 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Preparations: The Zhejiang Provincial Postal Workers Federation is located at the Guankou Branch Office. After receiving the news of the Shanghai strike, because the four items of the postal base consolidation plan were not accepted by the Ministry, the Federation prepared to respond and take unified action with Shanghai to show its determination to support postal rights. By the evening of the 23rd, a strike was declared.</p>
<p>Strike Declaration: The Zhejiang Postal Workers Federation's strike declaration stated: "Under the leadership of the National Postal Workers General Union and the General Labor Union, in order to save the postal crisis and express our unified determination, we announce a strike starting on the 24th and await orders. This struggle of ours is not for the benefit of colleagues, but for the entire postal industry, which has a great relationship with the people and the country. The postal industry can only be healthy and sound in the political environment of China by relying on the integrity of the organization and the independence of administration and economy. Unfortunately, since the recovery of postal rights, it has gradually been dominated by political forces and has shown a tendency to corruption. Two years ago, a few ambitious people wanted to seize the postal economic power and implemented a plan to place private individuals. Under the name of development, they forcibly separated the important parts of the postal service, savings and remittance business, and established parallel management agencies. This is the current Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. Branch offices were established successively in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou and other places. In reality, the land-based savings and remittance business is still handled concurrently by postal departments in various places. However, the organization and system of the postal service have been broken since then. The use of personnel and administration by the Savings and Remittance Bureau is even more unbearable. The annual expenditure has increased by more than 3 million yuan. At the same time, airlines were opened, and the postal service subsidizes more than 1 million yuan each year. Such extravagance has led to the current postal losses and the implementation of this postage increase. However, the postage increase only makes the people suffer, and the postal service itself does not benefit at all. How long can the life of the postal service be extended by continuing to 'cut flesh to mend sores'? Therefore, Shanghai postal colleagues felt the darkness of the future and the importance of their responsibilities. On the 1st of this month, they gathered the opinions of colleagues across the country and submitted a 'Specific Plan for Consolidating the Postal Base' to the transportation authorities, requesting the following points: (1) Abolish the Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the savings and remittance business will still be managed by the postal department; (2) Stop subsidizing all expenses of the airline; (3) Temporarily maintain the original postage rates, and increase them after items 1 and 2 have been implemented and the postal budget is still insufficient; (4) Implement independent postal economy and special postal accounting, that is, use the postal economy to exclusively support the postal service; (5) Maintain the independent postal administration system; (6) Maintain the postal personnel system and guarantee the existing treatment of postal workers. Although there have been considerable revisions regarding the postage increase since the proposal of this plan, the authorities have completely lacked the sincerity to accept the above fundamental requirements. For a month, postal groups across the country have filed petitions one after another. The Shanghai General Labor Union and the General Chamber of Commerce have also simultaneously urged the transportation authorities to adopt them. However, the authorities have not been moved at all. We cannot but admit that they have other intentions and are willing to destroy the postal service. Today, we received an order from the National Postal Workers General Union to take strike action by colleagues in this city starting at 6:00 AM tomorrow (24th) in order to promote the authorities' awareness and await a resolution. We will not resume work until the goal is achieved. We are seeking permanent benefits for the people and cannot but hope that the people will endure temporary inconvenience. Dear people, forgive us and help us!"</p>

<h3 id="e153">Songjiang Postal Workers Union Expresses <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The local postal workers' union stopped work for one day yesterday to show its support for the Shanghai postal strike. It resumed work as usual this morning (the 24th). Its statement roughly stated that the postal organization has always been very complete, and the economy is also quite abundant. However, in recent years, the Ministry of Communications has forcibly divided the savings and remittance section and subsidized the airline, resulting in accumulation. Without thinking about addressing the root cause, it has increased postage rates, increasing the burden on the people. Other restrictions on the number of postal workers and the cancellation of employee rice subsidies are even more unbearable for our hardworking postal workers. For this reason, the Shanghai postal strike is to urge the authorities to wake up. We will strengthen our internal organization to show our support by stopping work for one day.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Wuxi Postal Workers Unanimously Respond to the Strike <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>As a result of the strike by the Shanghai Postal Bureau, mail delivery was disrupted and news was blocked. The first-class post office on Hanchang Road in this county, as well as the third-class post offices in Jiangyin Lane, Simenhoumen, and Shitan Bay, etc., also went on strike unanimously starting at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 24th) in response to the order from the two postal workers' unions. They distributed leaflets and posted notices from the Postal Workers' Union Committee, stating: "The plan to consolidate the postal base, which was proposed by the two Shanghai postal associations after gathering the opinions of postal workers across the country, is a fundamental solution to save the postal service in danger. The postal workers' unions in various places have previously requested the authorities to adopt and implement it by telegram. It has now been ordered by the National Postal Workers' Unions, stating that the authorities disregard the interests and are determined to refuse. It has been ordered that the Association instruct all postal workers to go on strike uniformly from now on and not to resist. Therefore, our Association will announce a strike from today. During the strike period, members of the Association will not handle any postal affairs and will wait quietly for the General Association to resolve the matter and wait for the order to resume work."</p>

<h3 id="e157">Important News: The E Province Government Strives to Resolve the Education Turmoil <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Summons Teachers and Staff for Talks, Returns Resignations</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence – The education sector in E Province, due to the rejection of Shen Shiyuan, has caused a strike and work stoppage, and more than 10,000 young people have unfortunately abandoned their studies. Governor Xia Doudong, in order to resolve the dispute as soon as possible, specially summoned representatives of the education sector for talks on the 21st, and recommended provincial committee member Kong Geng and Secretary-General Yang Zaichun to persuade them. It is based on the fact that Kong is a senior figure in central E, and his virtue and reputation are well-respected and respected by the education sector, and Yang once served as acting Education Director, hoping to influence them emotionally. At 10:00 AM on the 21st, more than 30 education representatives, including Wang Yizhou, responded to the summons and arrived at the government office. Kong and Yang received them. Kong first asked two points, one was why Shen was rejected, and the other was why it was necessary to strike because of the rejection of Shen. He also conveyed Governor Xia's opinions, one to cancel the rejection of Shen, and the other to resume classes immediately. Education representative He Qingming expressed that the rejection of Shen was a matter of personality and career. Wang Yizhou said that he hoped the provincial government would approve the resignation and issue the back wages. Kong and Yang repeatedly persuaded them to take the students' studies as the priority and resume classes immediately, and returned the resignations on the spot. The representatives firmly refused to accept them. At the same time, they solemnly stated that resignation was not a strike. After talking for a long time, they dispersed without any result. At 12:00 noon, more than 30 teacher and staff representatives, including Luo Bingshu, went to the Education Bureau to demand back wages. The new Education Director Shen Shiyuan personally came out to meet them. Luo and others recounted their difficulties and said that Shen came with a plan and had his own appropriate methods. Colleagues had already resigned from various schools and museums and asked to issue back wages as soon as possible so that they could change their careers. Shen replied that the right to raise and issue arrears was in the provincial government, and the Education Bureau had no possibility of advocating it alone. He will, to the best of his ability, submit it to the provincial government meeting for long-term discussion. After Shen replied, the representatives continued to state their plight and asked to raise and issue them as soon as possible, but there was no result. The provincial government, because the persuasion was ineffective, convened a temporary meeting at 3:00 PM and decided on two measures: one was for the government to earnestly persuade the heads of various schools and museums and teachers and staff to perform their duties as usual, so as not to let students waste their studies; the other was to order the Education Bureau to handle it properly, and to instruct the heads of various schools and museums, teachers and staff to work with peace of mind and resume classes immediately to comfort the youth's desire to study. The instruction said, "For instruction matters, after investigating the reports published in various newspapers in Wuhan for days, the provincial schools are in a state of strike. According to the joint names of the heads of various schools and museums, teachers and staff of the schools and museums have all resigned from various schools and museums and submitted requests to relieve the heads of the schools and museums, etc., to the government. Yesterday, the Political Affairs Conference decided to publicly recommend the government committee member Kong and Secretary-General Yang to represent the government and summon the heads of the schools and museums, etc., for earnest persuasion, and the submitted resignations were returned on the spot and filed. According to the report of the government committee member Kong and Secretary-General Yang, after repeated explanations, the heads of the schools and museums still refused to withdraw their resignations, their words were tactful and their intentions were determined, and they were afraid that the schools would not be able to resume classes for a while. The government deeply regrets this. After investigating and appointing officials, the central government has its own discretion, and all teachers and staff should abide by it. Now, they are resigning en masse, wasting the time of the students and delaying the time, and they should also feel uneasy. It has been decided by the government's temporary meeting, in addition to instructing the Education Bureau to handle it as soon as possible, to earnestly persuade all the heads of the schools and museums and teachers and staff to be aware of it, to work with peace of mind and resume classes immediately to comfort the youth's desire to study. We have high hopes for this, this order." (May 21st)</p>

<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Southeast Medical College in Zhenru was located in the war zone. All the instruments, specimens, equipment, and students' luggage and books in the school were not moved out. After our army changed its strategy and retreated to the second line of defense, Zhenru fell, and the school building was occupied by the enemy. The objects in the school were also looted, with losses amounting to hundreds of thousands. It was recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday (the 23rd), the Japanese army withdrew as agreed. The principal of the school, Guo Qiyuan, led the teachers and staff to take over and reorganize. In order to investigate the actual situation of the school after the robbery after the war, the Municipal Education Bureau also sent personnel to inspect it. It is reported that the school has taken photos of the traces of the destruction and robbery of the school building this time in preparation for reporting to the Ministry of Education in the future.</p>

<p>Departure for the United States Around July 15th</p>
<p>A London telegram stated that Britain will select representatives to attend the 10th World Games to be held in the United States this autumn amidst economic constraints and strict rules. The details are translated as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e162">Date of Selection <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The British Olympic Games Association has indicated to various sports organizations that the amount of money it can raise can exceed that of those who attended the 1928 Games. The Association does not intend to select additional candidates.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Records of Striking the Bell at the Old Temple (5) - The Unswept Courtyard and the Studious Man <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>When villagers talk about me, they immediately think of bell-ringing, so they call me "Bell." Over time, "Bell" became my only name. However, what I do at the old temple is more than just ringing the bell. It's probably because the bell-ringing is closely related to the villagers, so they remember it firmly. As for other things that don't concern them, they don't pay much attention. My daily work, besides ringing the bell, includes fetching water and growing vegetables. Also, I empty the chamber pot for the monk. I do the fetching water and growing vegetables as seriously as ringing the bell, so I won't talk much about them for now. It's only the matter of emptying the chamber pot for the monk that I'm embarrassed to talk about but can't bear not to mention. I've been doing this work since I was six years old, and it's been almost ten years now. At first, I only knew that the smell of the chamber pot was a bit unpleasant, and I thought it was something that children should do. When the monk needs to use the Analects, he is also a follower of Confucius. He often explains to me, "When there is something to be done, the disciples take on the labor." He says that these things include emptying the chamber pot.</p>
<p>Recently, I've begun to have doubts: "The monk also has hands, why can't he empty the chamber pot himself? Sick people and old people should be cared for. The monk is young and not sick, why does he need me to serve him?" Thinking about this, I immediately picked up a pen and wrote four lines:</p>
<p>"I have a pair of hands,</p>
<p>To ring the bell and grow vegetables.</p>
<p>To empty the chamber pot for others,</p>
<p>Is not what a true man does."</p>
<p>That night, I made a great resolution: from now on, I will only be a public servant for the masses, not a personal servant.</p>
<p>The next evening, after dinner, the monk picked up the chamber pot, felt it was heavy, and knew that it hadn't been emptied. He called me into the room, pointed at the chamber pot with his opium pipe, and said, "Have you forgotten to eat? Empty it!"</p>
<p>I said, "I can't empty it!"</p>
<p>He said, "Have your hands rotted off?"</p>
<p>I said, "Where are your hands? Empty your own chamber pot!"</p>
<p>He was so angry that he aimed the opium pipe at my head and knocked it. I caught it with my hand, and with a snap, it broke into two pieces! He immediately sent a fist towards my chest. I took a step back, caught his fist with my right hand, supported his elbow with my left hand, and pushed him with a smile, saying, "Use your strength to hit people to empty your own chamber pot!"</p>
<p>When I caught the monk's fist and supported the monk's elbow, I could have easily pushed him to the ground and made him eat mud with a simple press. Why didn't I do that? The monk really couldn't beat me. My fist doesn't hit those weaker than me. Besides, my purpose is only to no longer empty the chamber pot for him. He attacked me, and I had no choice but to resist. I only needed to let him know that I was unyielding to force, so why show off my strength? The monk still didn't understand and said angrily, "Get out! The food in this temple is not for you to eat. Get out with your tattered cloth and rotten cotton!" After saying that, the monk walked out of the temple in a huff. I don't know where he spent the night.</p>
<p>I am waiting to strike the last morning bell, bidding farewell to my village friends, and then going to the wide world to earn a living.</p>
<p>Supplemental Representatives: The full team of athletes has not yet been selected. The selection period is likely to be within one or two weeks before leaving for the United States in mid-July.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Number of People and Expenses <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>It is estimated that the United Kingdom will select 30 representatives and 20 staff members. Each person will be given 150 pounds for travel expenses. The association plans to raise 15,000 pounds through free donations from enthusiastic sports supporters. If the sum of 15,000 pounds cannot be raised, the selection of representatives will be further reduced. In this case, the United Kingdom will only be able to participate with one person in each sport.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Clothing and Identification <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Most of the funds will be used to purchase clothing for the athletes, including uniforms, undershirts, shorts, red, white, and blue stripes. Travel expenses and athletes' allowances, as well as food and lodging, will be provided by the United States. This year, the uniform style has been slightly changed. The white shorts will be replaced with red, white, and blue stripes around the chest for easy identification.</p>

<p>Preparation for the Six Giants Sports Meet</p>
<p>The Shanghai Six Giants Sports Meet will be held on the 4th of next month. The Chinese YMCA has a significant influence among the six giants, mainly because the university athletes have been eager to try their skills since the Shanghai Incident. Now, they will serve the YMCA and participate in this grand sports meet. It is scheduled to hold a competition against the athletes of Great China University at Great China University on Jiaozhou Road this Saturday at 1:30 PM for practice. Most of the Great China University athletes are also YMCA athletes. This competition is only a nominal distinction, and in reality, they are all one family.</p>

<p>Mr. Hong Xianfang Donates a Silver Cup as a Prize</p>
<p>First Committee Meeting on the 30th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Tennis Federation was established in 1926. The first members included Lotte, Youyou, Yu Kuai, the YMCA, and the Chinese Five Ball Association. Through annual competitions, it had grown to as many as eleven teams by 1930, which shows the federation's contribution to promoting interest in tennis in Shanghai. The prize for the federation's competition was a large silver cup donated by Mr. Hong Xianfang. The cup had been won by the Chinese Association and expired in 1930. Last year, it was suspended indefinitely. Fortunately, the launch of the Xianfang Cup competition prevented Chinese competitions from being interrupted. However, the long history of the Chinese Tennis Federation was interrupted, which was regretted by all the ball clubs. Therefore, it was proposed that the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association should find a way to restore it. The association has written to Mr. Hong Xianfang to jointly discuss the restoration plan. Now, Mr. Hong has generously agreed to transfer the Xianfang Cup from last year as a national competition prize and entrust the association to prepare for and continue the competition in order to restore the only Chinese joint competition organization in Shanghai. His intention is excellent. The Association has now written to Fang Bofen, Ling Xitao, Chen Shao, Gu Qingyu, Ma Detai, and Zhang Zizhen to serve as committee members. The first meeting will be held at the Deng Tuomo Hotel at 12:30 PM on the 30th to plan the implementation.</p>

<p>A society that is frighteningly arrogant and pitifully naive, that highly disregards "love" and highly values "sex," and youths who were originally to be relied upon as the backbone of the future, the current general university students, jumped out of the environment of all evils to reform it. Who knew that the university students in Shanghai would suffer hardship before graduating? Those from wealthy families don't need others to take care of them; they have their own ways to find "safety." But the poor students in ragged clothes and with nothing to their names, who usually barely make ends meet, have difficulty surviving after suffering unexpected disasters. Therefore, those who were preparing to save society now need society to save them. Thus, the general poor scholars have the organization of the "Shanghai Schools' Disaster-Stricken Students Association," which has its office in the East China Apartment on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. There are 606 university students participating. They elected representatives to carry out activities everywhere. The Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to conduct registration of disaster-stricken students, preparing to subsidize their return to their hometowns. From March 28th to April 2nd, a full week, only 36 people came forward to register with proof of their original school attendance. Five were middle school students, and the other 575 university students disappeared without a sound, not knowing where they went.</p>

<p>From the table on the right, we can see that the suffering of students who came to Shanghai from afar is several times greater than those from the local area and those near the local area. The reporter knows that the Patriotic Girls' Middle School in Chenyuan, Jiangwan Road, fled in a panic during the war, barely escaping with their lives. All their personal belongings were stored in the school, which was then set on fire by the enemy on the grass field. There were three female students from Sichuan who were in a dilemma and suffered unspeakable pain. Finally, their principal put together a few dollars to buy a boat to return to their hometowns. This is what I know personally. There must be many other students who have suffered terribly. Alas! Who caused this to happen? The 36 registered students, after a thorough investigation by the government and an additional oral examination, were given pocket money, free tickets, travel expenses, and letters of introduction, and were sent back to their hometowns one by one. In reality, 32 students returned, and 4 students have not yet received the money to make arrangements for their return. Presumably, they are planning other ways. The total cost of sending them back was 321 yuan. Apart from most of the government allocation, the Guangzhao Association subsidized 90 yuan, and the War Zone Refugee Relief Association subsidized 50 yuan.</p>

<p>In a period of great seriousness and imminent disaster, how can we calmly talk about Children's Memorial Day? However, how can we not talk about Children's Memorial Day? The importance of children from a national standpoint far outweighs their importance from a family standpoint by thousands of times. Moreover, in China, which is shaky and full of disasters, the Municipal Education Bureau formulated the "Implementation Outline for Commemorating Children's Day in Shanghai Primary Schools and Kindergartens During the National Crisis," "Teacher's Homework Reference Materials for Commemorating Children's Day in Shanghai Primary Schools and Kindergartens," and "Slogans for Children's Day" on March 1st, amidst the urgent rumors of enemy attacks on Nanshi, and distributed them to the schools for compliance. On April 4th, Children's Day, it sent personnel to the schools to inspect and guide them. Now, I record a copy of the implementation outline and 26 waiting slogans for reference.</p>
<p>Implementation Outline for Commemorating Children's Day in Shanghai Primary Schools and Kindergartens During the National Crisis</p>

Each school should prepare a detailed report on the implementation of Children's Day and send it to the bureau for review.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Child Welfare Association has contacted many celebrities to write commemorative articles for Children's Day. Readers may not forget that Shanghai's major newspapers carried celebrities' handwriting on April 4th. That day, the Child Welfare Association also held a variety show. The masters watching from the audience were mostly the little brothers and sisters in the refugee camps. This year is their unprecedented first Chinese Children's Day. It is a pity that the commemoration in Shanghai cannot be carried out as they wish, nor can it arouse the attention of the whole society.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Yang Rongwei, Xie Chengping, Shen Zurong, and others suspected of obstructing official duties in the assault on Guo case, which has already undergone one interrogation, Lawyer Zhao Chen has submitted a defense statement to the Second Special Court, requesting a decision not to prosecute. The reasons for this request are detailed below: (1) Insufficient evidence of criminal suspicion: The assault on Guo Taiqi on May 3rd was purely the act of numerous unknown civilians, and the defendants had absolutely no involvement. There are many pieces of evidence to the contrary, and a few are highlighted below: (1) The four defendants, Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Xie Chengping, and Yang Rongwei, representing various groups of the National Salvation United Association, first went to Guo's residence. Shen Zurong, representing the University United Association, then arrived to inquire about the contents of the agreement. During their discussions with Guo Taiqi, no disagreements occurred, and no large crowds of people surged in. Considering the close relationship between the defendants and Guo on ordinary days, they would never resort to violence in either public or private matters. (2) When Guo Taiqi moved to another room to negotiate with the two representatives, Dai Ji and Huang Qiang, the crowd swarmed in, demanding that Guo explain the contents of the agreement. After Guo entered the room, when he leaned on the table and read out the first article of the ceasefire agreement, "Cease all and any combat actions in the vicinity of Shanghai," the crowd misunderstood it to mean that neither the Nanshi nor Pudong areas would be allowed to station troops, and became deeply angered, causing an uproar of accusations. The defendants, Li Cishan and Yin Zhiling, immediately urged the crowd to be patient and listen to the rest of the text. At that time, many in the crowd expressed opposition to Li and Yin, even shouting "Get out, get out!" and hurling abuse at them. This was witnessed and heard by Guo Taiqi himself, which can prove that the defendants never colluded with the crowd in any violent acts. (3) After Guo Taiqi was surrounded by the crowd, the defendants tried in many ways to appease them, but to no avail. Copper coins and teapots were thrown around in a chaotic manner, and the defendants were all in danger of being hit, covering their heads and unable to avoid it. Even if the identities of the perpetrators are unknown, it is undeniable by Guo Taiqi that the defendants did not participate. (4) The only strong evidence for the assault on Guo is Guo himself identifying the perpetrators in court. None of Guo's family members or employees witnessed the event, so their testimonies are unreliable. Since Guo has repeatedly stated to the press that it is difficult to identify the individuals in the crowd at the time, there is essentially no usable evidence in this case, and the defendants should not bear unwarranted responsibility. (5) When the crowd assaulted Guo, there were no fewer than a hundred people. Afterwards, they fled in all directions. If the defendants had participated, why couldn't they have fled with the crowd at that time? Only because of their closer relationship with Guo did they stay at Guo's residence to inquire about his injuries. This is sufficient to presume that the defendants did not inflict any violence on Guo. (6) When the police detectives arrived at Guo's residence, the crowd had already dispersed. The detectives saw that the defendants had not left and suspected them of assault, so they took them to the police station. When Guo heard the news, he was well aware that the two defendants, Li Cishan and Yin Zhiling, were completely innocent. He immediately entrusted Xia Qifeng to personally go to the police station to bail them out. The other defendants were also bailed out by people entrusted by Guo himself. All of this can serve as proof that the defendants are not suspected of committing a crime in this case. Moreover, the defendants are either well-known lawyers in Shanghai, experts in research and education, have studied abroad, or are university professors, all having received higher education. They can argue with reason and defend themselves with facts. How could they resort to such a foolish act of violence? In summary, there is insufficient evidence of criminal suspicion against the defendants, and they should be granted a decision not to prosecute in accordance with Article 244, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. (2) The act does not constitute a crime: Guo Taiqi was not assaulted while performing his duties according to the law, so Article 142, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law cannot be applied. Based on the circumstances of the day, the assault occurred before he was actually performing his duties. It is presumed that your court believes the defendants are suspected of violating Article 142, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and is exercising its investigative authority. However, whether a crime is established requires both ordinary and special elements. If one element is missing, a crime is not constituted. The defendants are indeed not suspected of violating Article 142, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Assuming that they are, in addition to the ordinary elements, the following special elements must also be present: 1. Intention to obstruct official duties; 2. Use of violence or coercion; 3. Obstructing the lawful performance of specific duties. However, the defendants did not possess the aforementioned special elements. Furthermore, the duty performed by Guo Taiqi was the signing of the ceasefire agreement, and whether the signing procedure was fundamentally illegal has already become a major issue in national law. Article 27 of the revised Organic Law of the National Government of December 30, 1931, stipulates that "The Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body of the National Government." "The Legislative Yuan has the power to decide on legislative bills, budget bills, amnesty bills, declarations of war, peace treaties, and other important international matters." In addition, the "Regulations on the Exercise of Sovereignty" passed by the Third Central Executive Committee's Second Plenary Session on June 17, 1929, and promulgated by the National Government on July 3, stipulated in Article 1 that "All legislative bills, financial bills related to the Party's finances, and treaty bills or other international agreement bills related to national rights, which fall within the scope of legislation, may not be established without a resolution by the Legislative Yuan. If they are promulgated and implemented without a resolution by the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan has the responsibility to raise questions, and the organ that promulgated and implemented them will be deemed to have overstepped its authority. If the Legislative Yuan does not raise questions, it will be deemed to have neglected its duty." According to the above provisions, the Shanghai ceasefire agreement could not be established fundamentally without a resolution by the Legislative Yuan. It is undoubtedly true that it should not have been rashly signed without a resolution by the Legislative Yuan. As a senior diplomat and former acting minister, Guo Taiqi could not claim ignorance of the legal procedures for international agreements to be resolved by the Legislative Yuan, nor could he claim that he was acting on orders from higher authorities and had no choice but to carry them out. Guo also knew that the law has the strongest force and that the power of the law is higher than orders. Performing duties according to the law and performing duties according to orders are clearly strictly distinguished and must not be mistaken. Even though it has already been signed in fact, it is still an illegal signing, and no amount of argument can absolve it of blame. Moreover, it was a signing according to orders, not according to the law, which is an undeniable fact. Taking a step back, even if it is assumed that the defendants are suspected of assaulting Guo, it was obstructing the unlawful performance of a specific duty, not obstructing the lawful performance of a specific duty. The crime of Article 142, Paragraph 2 cannot be established. Even if there was an act of assault, it would at most constitute the crime of "injury out of righteous indignation on the spot" under Article 297 of the Criminal Law. However, according to Article 4 of the "Agreement for the Establishment of Chinese Courts in the French Concession of Shanghai," your court can only investigate cases to which Articles 103 to 186 of the Criminal Law apply. As for other cases, they should be prosecuted by the French Concession authorities or initiated by the victim as a private prosecution. This is assuming that the defendant is suspected of committing a crime. On the one hand, the elements of obstructing official duties according to the law are lacking, and on the other hand, there is no authority to investigate the crime of injury out of righteous indignation. It is already inappropriate to prosecute, let alone when the defendants are inherently free from the suspicion of committing the aforementioned crimes. According to Article [unclear]44, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a decision not to prosecute should be made. (3) The circumstances are minor, and it is more beneficial to decide not to prosecute: The cause of this case stems from the public's patriotic fervor. The public deeply feels the close relationship between national interests and their own interests and is unwilling for the government to take any actions that would cede sovereignty and humiliate the country. The content of the Shanghai ceasefire agreement is controversial, and the public is confused. Guo Taiqi showed people a draft of the agreement in English, so how could the public not misunderstand it? The public, in order to prevent the illegal signing of the ceasefire agreement, took actions outside the bounds of the law. Their public anger was aroused by patriotic zeal, which is forgivable under the law and commendable in spirit. This kind of tragic and intense expression makes outsiders celebrate that the national spirit of China is not to be trifled with and that the patriotic thought is advancing rapidly. It should be cherished and cultivated to nurture a great national spirit, and high-handed measures must not be used to frustrate its lively and vigorous vitality. Remembering that after the Meiji Restoration in Japan, the government worked hard to abolish consular jurisdiction, but various countries set the condition that foreign judges be hired in the courts. At that time, public resentment reached its peak, and when a meeting was held in Hibiya Park, the leg of Foreign Minister Okuma Shigenobu, who was responsible for signing the treaty, was blown off. Also, during the Russo-Japanese War, US President Roosevelt took on the role of mediator. The Japanese government knew that prolonged warfare would likely lead to defeat by Russia, so it seized this opportunity to cease hostilities and negotiate peace, sending its diplomatic representative, Komura Jutaro, to sign the Treaty of Portsmouth. The general public, dissatisfied with the government's humiliating diplomacy, severely beat Komura upon his return to the country. Afterwards, the Japanese government, respecting public opinion, did not pursue the matter in depth. Neither Okuma nor Komura dared to offend public anger, and neither sought prosecution. Furthermore, since the September 18th Incident in the three northeastern provinces last year, Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting was beaten first, followed by National Government Commissioner Cai Yuanpei and Executive Yuan President Chen Mingshu being injured. The central government respected public opinion and did not thoroughly investigate. Wang, Cai, and Chen also did not want to go against public opinion and request the court to severely punish the perpetrators. How is Guo Taiqi's beating any different from the injuries suffered by Okuma, Komura, Wang, Cai, and Chen? At this time, when public misunderstandings have not been resolved and the tide of patriotic anger is at its peak, the handling must be cautious to avoid arousing public indignation. As the saying goes, "Agitation breeds change," and "Preventing the people's mouths is more difficult than preventing a river." It is like a river rising, and if the downstream is blocked, the embankments will collapse, the floods will overflow, and it will be impossible to control. It is necessary to dredge the waterways first so that the flood can flow into the sea, and then the flood will subside. The approach to handling the Guo case is the same. The government does not need to investigate deeply, and the court does not need to severely punish, and then the public anger will subside. Afterwards, they will naturally know to restrain themselves. Moreover, the agreement has already been signed, Guo has not suffered serious injuries, and the circumstances are minor. It is more beneficial to decide not to prosecute, not to mention that the defendants themselves did not commit any violent acts. According to Article 245, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a decision not to prosecute should be made. (4) The victim does not wish for punishment: The victim in this case, Guo Taiqi, has repeatedly stated that he does not wish to investigate deeply. Therefore, he has neither personally filed a private prosecution with the court nor requested your court to prosecute. His intention not to wish for punishment is obvious. According to Article 245, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a decision not to prosecute should be made. Based on the above reasons, I sincerely urge your court to examine the matter closely, weigh the circumstances and the law, and decisively issue a decision not to prosecute, in order to uphold the rule of law and avoid injustice. This would truly be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Procuratorate of the Shanghai Second Special District District Court. (May 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e178">Municipal Health Bureau's Diligent Efforts in Cleaning Up Zhabei <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Correction of Japanese Newspaper Reports</p>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau to the Shanghai Troop Withdrawal Area Takeover Committee states: With regards, upon investigation, a news report regarding hygiene matters in Zhabei was published in the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun newspaper on the 21st of this month, which is entirely untrue. Furthermore, the Shen Bao and the English-language China Press newspapers also reported that the Director of the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council reported to the Board of Directors that it was handling part of the street cleaning work in Zhabei, but the wording was ambiguous and should be corrected to avoid confusion. Therefore, the facts are listed below for your Committee to investigate, separately inform, correct, and disclose. (1) On May 21st, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun newspaper stated that after the Zhabei area was taken over by this city, no preparations had been made for hygiene work. However, when the various parts of Zhabei were occupied by the Japanese army, garbage piled up and urine and feces were scattered everywhere. After the Takeover Committee divided the area and implemented the takeover, the Municipal Health Bureau immediately dispatched street cleaners to carry out work in the areas that had been taken over. Since May 16th, street cleaning has been carried out in the area south of the railway and north of the Suzhou Creek (i.e., part of the jurisdiction of the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau, as well as the First and Second Sub-offices of the Fourth District) to remove the accumulated garbage and fecal contamination from the Japanese military occupation as the first step. After the accumulated garbage and fecal contamination have been removed, daily street cleaning work will be resumed according to the original method. A total of 160 street cleaners were dispatched, divided into groups to take charge of sweeping, washing, disinfecting, and other tasks, and three administrators were assigned to effectively supervise the work. Since the implementation on the 16th, from the date of takeover to the 20th, more than 8,550 carts of accumulated garbage have been removed, weighing approximately 2,800 tons. It was loaded onto barges and towed by small tugboats to the municipal government's designated landfill at Longhua Wharf for disposal in accordance with the law. In addition, free vaccinations were promoted, and more than 3,800 people have been vaccinated. The above facts can prove that the Japanese newspaper's claim that no preparations were made for hygiene facilities in the areas taken over is completely inaccurate. As for the claim that cholera has occurred in Tanzhiwan, the Municipal Health Bureau had already investigated and confirmed that one person had cholera in Tanzhiwan on April 26th (during the Japanese military occupation before the takeover). However, the patient had been isolated and treated. This further proves that the Municipal Health Bureau is extremely concerned about hygiene and disease prevention and is working hard. The facts should be disclosed to show the reality. (2) On May 21st, the Shen Bao and the English-language China Press newspapers reported that the Director of the Public Health Department of the Public Concession reported to the Chairman of the Board that hygiene work was being carried out in the area around McLaren College and North Sichuan Road on Dixwell Road, and that it seemed that the Chinese authorities would not be able to exercise their powers there for some time. However, that area is still occupied by the Japanese army, and the Takeover Committee has not yet implemented the takeover. However, the Municipal Health Bureau has made full preparations for the rectification of hygiene matters in various parts of Zhabei. Once the takeover is completed, all street cleaning, disinfection, disease prevention, and other work can be implemented immediately. The sooner the Japanese army withdraws, the sooner the hygiene of the residents there can be restored. Looking at the active implementation of hygiene work in the areas that have already been taken over, it can be seen that the Chinese municipal government and the Municipal Health Bureau in charge of this matter attach great importance to and are working hard on this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Investigation After the War in Jiangwan <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jehol Relief Association believes that it is difficult to ascertain the true situation of the local residents in Jiangwan and other places after the war in Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the Director of the Rescue Team, Zhang Xianqing, led members in a private car to Jiangwan to investigate. The east-west main streets of the town, formerly prosperous markets, had all turned into rubble and rotten wood, a scene of extreme devastation. However, the west main street, Yin Jia Zha, Li Xiaozifang, and nearby shops had not been burned, but bullet holes and gaps were visible everywhere. According to the local people, the descendants of Li Xiaozi were very poor but were able to be self-disciplined and filial, so the neighborhood was also sheltered, and the disaster did not reach them. This shows that good deeds bring blessings, which is credible and substantiated. The Jiangwan Disaster Relief Association for Fellow Villagers has set up a disaster victim registration office inside the Jiangwan Grand Temple Fire Brigade, so that disaster victims can register temporarily and then discuss the situation and provide money and rice. It is heard that there were more than 6,000 shops and residents in the town. Since the Shanghai war, they have all fled to other places. Now that the area is peaceful, the residents are returning home one after another, but they have no homes to return to, and the good disaster victims have no food, clothing, or shelter, making it difficult to survive. In addition to hoping for relief from the government and charitable organizations, countless lives will likely have no way to survive.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Establishment of the Xinwei Relief Association <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Urgent Relief of Flood Disasters in Various Provinces and the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association have both concluded their work. However, both associations believe that while the disaster was due to fate, it was also caused by human failings. Therefore, in order to learn from past mistakes and prevent future problems, and because nearly 2,000 refugees taken in by the current relief association have no homes to return to, and the relief work in provinces where the urgent relief association has not completed its work still needs to be properly planned for, the association, commemorating the year of the disaster, Xinwei, is named the Xinwei Relief Association and was established yesterday. The charter is recorded below: (Article 1) The purpose of this association is to provide relief to disaster-stricken compatriots in a proactive manner, so that they can each make a living. This association will continue to handle relief matters from the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Urgent Relief of Flood Disasters in Various Provinces and the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association in the year Xinwei, hence the name Xinwei Relief Association. (Article 2) This association is initiated and organized by people from various charitable and public welfare organizations in Shanghai. (Article 3) The members of this association will elect 31 directors and 11 supervisors, and the directors will elect among themselves one chairman, one vice-chairman, and nine standing directors to carry out the association's affairs. This association will have an unlimited number of honorary directors. (Article 4) The organization of this association is as follows: Executive Group, Review Group, and Finance Group. Each group will have one director and one deputy director, who will be appointed by the Board of Directors. Organizational regulations and rules of procedure will be drawn up separately. (Article 5) This association may appoint a number of staff members to handle various affairs separately. (Article 6) This association will hold a general meeting of members once a year, a board meeting once a quarter, and a standing board meeting once a month. Extraordinary meetings may be convened when necessary. (Article 7) The administrative expenses and operating expenses of this association will be temporarily raised by this association. (Article 8) All income and expenditure of money and goods will be announced in the newspapers at any time. (Article 9) This charter will be reported to the National Government Relief Committee for record after being approved by the General Assembly. (Article 10) If there are any matters not covered in this charter, they may be submitted by the Board of Directors to the General Assembly for amendment. The list of directors includes: Wen Lantong, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jingren, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xiaolin, Ye Jingqiu, Huang Hanzhi, Zhao Jinqing, Zhang Xiaoliang, Wang Rutang, Zhu Ziqiao, Wang Yiting, Chen Aishi, Li Zushen, Wu Zhihao, Qu Wenliu, Weng Yinchu, Shen Lisun, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Zhou Shouliang, Huang Bodu, Wang Boqi, Shi Liangcai, Xi Yunsheng, Feng Liutang, Zhou Weishi, Zhang Shenzhi, Gu Jisheng, Guan Yunsheng, Mao Yousheng. The list of supervisors includes: Li Yunshu, Ding Guicen, Lin Kanghou, Huang Jinrong, Yao Wugang, Wu Yunzhai, Gu Xinyi, Zhu Qiluo, Pan Xulun, Xu Yongzuo, Zhu Hujiang. It is said that the joint meeting of directors and supervisors will be held at 4 p.m. today at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road, where the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors will be held.</p>

<p>Temporary Launches to be Completely Removed</p>
<p>Restoration to the Original State Within a Week</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was interrupted, and inland transportation relied entirely on launches. The number of temporary launches on the Shanghai-Suzhou route greatly increased. Now that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has begun to operate, a large number of inland water vessels can only suspend their operations. The recent situation is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Early Morning Launches to Shanghai-Suzhou <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>On the Shanghai-Suzhou route, only China Merchants and Yuan Tong had ships operating. When the January 28th Incident occurred, a large number of refugees from Shanghai fled to Suzhou and Changzhou, and the Shanghai-Zhang Company and others temporarily added early morning launches, traveling back and forth daily to avoid the dangers of night航. After the [unclear] Incident, others followed suit, and there were China Merchants, Yuan Tong, Qingji, Heping, Yongyuan, Shanghai-Zhang, Zhengchang, Tongji, and Central companies, each forming a single early morning launch to Shanghai-Suzhou, specializing in carrying passengers. Freight, postal items, and newspapers were carried by mid- and late-day launches. In addition, the Changzhou-Xichang-Ganlu launches also sailed to Suzhou. The development of the Shanghai-Suzhou ships was unprecedented.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Suspension Due to Few Passengers <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the number of inland water launches has increased daily, while the number of passengers has decreased daily. The launch companies, competing for business, have reduced ticket prices. A first-class cabin, which sold for 48 yuan during the war, has now fallen to 12 yuan, and still no one is chartering it. A deck seat has also fallen to 1.10 yuan. Recently, each launch has only made a little more than 100 yuan per trip, which is not enough to cover the cost of coal, food, and other expenses. Yesterday, when the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was opened, the number of passengers decreased sharply. Each morning at the Old Gate Bridge, the barkers from each company had no passengers to solicit. Although they have not completely disappeared, there are only a few. The launch companies are currently discussing suspending operations.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Restoration to the Original State <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>It was heard yesterday that the China Merchants and Yuan Tong companies in the Shanghai-Suzhou launch route have decided that if no one boards the early morning launches, they will restore the Shanghai-Suzhou night launches, specializing in carrying cargo, and will restore the alternating daily service between the two companies. The temporary launches that were opened during the war, which have no fixed routes, will also have to be suspended, and each will open its original routes. It is planned to return to the situation before the January 28th Incident in one week. China Merchants will send newly built launches to operate on the Suzhou route.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Suzhou Customs Revenue <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the affairs of Suzhou Customs have greatly increased, and the tax revenue has also greatly increased. Originally, the tax revenue of Suzhou Customs relied entirely on one or two Shanghai ships, and the monthly income was barely enough to cover the salaries of the customs officers. After February, the number of launches greatly increased, and the tax revenue also improved. Now that the ships are about to suspend operations, the tax revenue of Suzhou Customs will plummet again.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Proposal for Summarizing Accounts at the End of June <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the January 28th War, the period for summarizing accounts for the 20th year of the Republic of China by the business community was agreed to be held at the end of May. Now that it is approaching, a part of the merchants in this city, according to the usual practice of Shanghai banks, propose that the settlement of accounts for this time of the business community can be held in accordance with the end of June, so that the transfer of accounts, interest, settlement, and other items will be consistent with the annual settlement of the banks, which will be convenient for all industries. They have petitioned the central government and the municipal chamber of commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Requesting Collection of Taxes Based on Actual Rent <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: With regards, it has been approved that the First District Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Federation has sent a letter stating that, according to the representatives of the Zhenbo Church, Wu Huichuan, Xie Senchang, Liu Zhongfa, Shunxingxiang, Xi Shengsen, Gutai Chang, Gu Fangsheng, and Zhou Rongzhang, Zhou Yiqing, and Lu Yinhua of Zhili Road, the rent for each room in Zhili Road is 32 yuan per month, and the police tax has also been calculated according to the rent over the years. However, at about 3 p.m. today, a Western employee of the Municipal Council came to collect the police tax, forcibly wanting to calculate the rent for each room as 40 yuan. The representatives believed that the police tax was based on the amount of rent, and there was an old precedent to follow, but the employee forcibly wanted to increase the tax and threatened that if the tax was not calculated according to the 40 yuan rent and sent to the tax office, the police would seal the door in three days, and copied down the door numbers. The representatives were therefore extremely alarmed and begged the association to forward the employee's coercive tax increase and threats to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to uphold justice. According to this, the Municipal Council forcibly estimates high rent prices in order to increase its revenue, directly causing tenants to bear an additional burden and indirectly promoting opportunities for landlords to raise prices. Such actions that oppress the common people are not what the Municipal Council, which is responsible for ensuring the safety of residents and maintaining local order, should do, nor can they be done by public officials. Similar cases have been repeatedly disputed by your association in the past. Now that we have received the above report, we should forward it for review, and we sincerely hope that you will negotiate with the Municipal Council as soon as possible to show fairness and protect the residents. It is inappropriate to collect taxes based on estimates that do not correspond to actual rents. Your office has repeatedly corrected this, but the tax office of your bureau has repeatedly and deliberately violated this, not knowing what the intention is. In the four reasons stated in your bureau's recent reports, except for one that is natural, the second, whether the house certificate has the word "Yi" on it, the third is purely speculation rather than fact, and the fourth should be handled according to the law if there is concrete evidence. This association believes that the financial plan of your bureau's treasurer is admirable, but it does not consider the method of actually adding to the tax to be bright, and it is actually against economic principles and property rules. The letter is hereby forwarded, and we hope that you will investigate and quickly order corrections so that you will not try again and cause more disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Notice of Proposed Water and Electricity Price Increase in the French Concession <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Property Owners' Association Objects</p>
<p>The issue of water price increases in the International Settlement remains unresolved, and there are also rumors of increases in water and electricity rates in the French Concession. According to insiders, water and electricity prices in the French Concession are already relatively high compared to other areas. Water fees have always been calculated using water meters, placing a heavy burden on property owners, unlike the International Settlement Water Company, which uses a flat rate system for ordinary alleyway houses. Therefore, there is no justification for further price increases. Moreover, the number of residents in the French Concession has been increasing year by year, and the water company's income has doubled, resulting in substantial profits. However, the company is now citing large expenses as a reason to request the Municipal Council to increase both water and electricity rates uniformly. The Municipal Council is currently considering the request and has not yet approved it. The Shanghai Property Owners' Association is greatly concerned upon hearing this news, believing that water and electricity rates in the French Concession are already higher than those in other areas, and further increases would only burden residents. They plan to send a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council, urging the Chinese directors to pay close attention and find ways to thwart the company's price increase plan.</p>

<p>The Zhabei National Products Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, was interrupted due to the Japanese invasion. Although the goods from various factories were stored in the orphanage, after the recovery of police authority and the restoration of order, Chen Yiting, Lin Guyun, Yi Zhiyun, and Wang Honghui were publicly appointed to inspect the goods. Most of the goods were lost. To protect a portion of the interests of the various factories, it has been decided to invite representatives from each factory to separately inspect and retrieve their goods at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 25th). A letter has also been sent to the Shanghai North Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau to request that officers be dispatched for protection and to permit the release of the goods.</p>

<p>The Henan Southern Special District Pacification Committee hosted a press conference for the local press at the Xinlide Western Restaurant on 4th Ma Road, Guangxi Road, at 12:00 noon yesterday (the 24th). More than 20 reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. During the conference, Yang Yifeng, a member of the committee, reported on the origins and current situation of the communist bandits in the Henan Special District, as well as future plans for suppression and the effectiveness of past joint efforts by the Party, government, and military. He also presented photographs of disaster-stricken civilians, which were very tragic to witness.

<h3 id="e191">Japanese Morphine Operation Busted on West Jiaxing Road <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Japanese National Nakamura Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>Morphine worth 35,000 gold coins Seized</p>
<p>A Japanese national named Nakamura had been secretly operating an illegal morphine sales operation at No. 18, Sande Lane, West Jiaxing Road, Hongkou. After the Municipal Council regained police authority in the Hongkou district, it resolved to severely crack down on such illegal operations. Wang Changgen and Zhao Bingkun, Chinese detectives of the Chief Inspector's Office of the General Inspectorate, reported the recent activities of the Japanese national to the authorities. A search warrant was requested from the First Special District Court, ordering Song Bingzheng, an investigator specializing in the prohibition of narcotics, and Pan Gensi, the western detective, to proceed to the address to conduct a search. The house was in a Japanese style. The Japanese national Nakamura resided on the upper floor, while the rear building and the pavilion were equipped with machines for manufacturing narcotics, with morphine stored inside. The Chinese and Western detectives, having previously obtained a search warrant from the Japanese consulate, immediately entered the premises and began the search. In addition to seizing narcotics on the spot, they also arrested nine Chinese residents in the house: Fang Yinbao, Lin Huiqing, Zhou Yongyuan, Yang Xiuwen, Guo Yuming, Chen Ruikang, Wang Kaiyan, Su Ahui, and Diao Jintang. The Japanese national Nakamura was also handed over by the detectives to the Japanese police officers who accompanied them to the Japanese Consulate. Yesterday morning, Fang and the other eight were sent to the First Special Court, where Magistrate Qiao Wanxuan conducted a preliminary hearing. According to Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, the defendants were being prosecuted under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law because they possessed substitutes for opium with the intention of selling them. It is reported that 119 pounds of morphine powder were seized, estimated to be worth over 35,000 gold coins, and all kinds of machinery are temporarily stored in the police station. As for the Japanese national Nakamura, a separate lawsuit will be filed with the relevant consulate. The Chinese and Western detectives then reported the circumstances of the search of the house. Magistrate Qiao then interrogated Fang Yinbao and the others one by one. The defendants all claimed that the drugs found were actually insecticide. As a result, the defendants were still detained pending further questioning. It is also reported that Magistrate Qiao will schedule a personal inspection of the house at a later date in order to gain a clear understanding of the situation for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e192">French Concession Security Gun Donation Company Case Opens <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Sixteen Households Already Registered and Paid</p>
<p>Mao Jingeng and Mao Jinsheng, head detectives of the French Concession's McLane Police Station, along with deputy detectives Wang Rusong and Jiang Changwen, and patrol detectives Gu Mingzhou and Lu Jinxiang, raided the Security (Gun Donation) Company at No. 8, Building B, Public Concession Road at noon the day before yesterday. They arrested Zhang Shengfu, a Ningbo native who was the accountant, and fourteen employees: Zhang Debao, Song Bolin, Yu Xueming, Yu Gansheng, Wang Kailiang, Shi Guifu, Lu Aquan, Du Arong, Chen Baorong, Han Huangjin, Zhou Lansheng, Wang Guihua, and Wang Hengchun. The main culprit is still at large. They confiscated twenty-five large and small account books, hundreds of registration certificates, a house lease (two-landlord Chen Yuncai signed a lease with the Security Company for 135 yuan per month), and five large and small lead signboards, stationery, and other items. Fifteen people who were waiting to register, including Shen Jifu, Lu Meiqing, Han Aquan, Gong Yimin, Feng Yongfu, Gu Chengfa, Xu Yongning, Zhao Shiquan, Hong Achun, Zhang Genfu, and Liu Jiacai, were also taken to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, they were ordered to be detained separately, pending delivery to the court for interrogation. The details were published in yesterday's newspaper. Subsequently, the police found that sixteen households had already registered and paid donations, including Xu Zhaoming, upstairs at Yufu Barber Shop, No. 87 Jixiang Street, who donated three opium pipes; Sun Yongchang, upstairs at Dingji Barber Shop, Xizilaihuo Street entrance of Fadamalu Road, who donated four opium pipes; Shangyushe, No. 82, Caishi Street entrance of Zhengjia Muqiao Street, who donated five opium pipes; Gao Jinsheng, No. 963, Xujiahui Road intersection of Bedang Road, who donated six opium pipes; Liu Sangji, No. 97, Baxianfang, who donated seven opium pipes; Sun Atang, No. 7, Lanfang Lane, Caishi Street, who donated nine opium pipes; Le Gongyu, No. 2, Tianxi Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao, who donated eight opium pipes; Chen Gengang, No. 331, Aiduya Road, who donated ten opium pipes; Daguangming, No. 67, Baoyu Lane, who donated fourteen opium pipes; Xu Asan, No. 25, Deshan Lane, who donated fourteen opium pipes; Zhao Shiqi, Wan Shangseng, Chen Asheng, Zhang Shaoji, Ni Xiangxian, and Zheng Yinlu, each donated one opium pipe, waiting for business. Yesterday, the police sent Zhang and the other fourteen to the Second Special District Court for investigation, and also sent Shen Jifu and the other fifteen to the case for testimony. At 3:00 PM, Magistrate Zhang Chaozuo and Clerk Wang Yihui arrived at the First Criminal Court for trial. According to Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, the police temporarily charged the defendants with joint fraud and obtaining property under Article 363 of the Criminal Law. As the main culprit is currently at large and the police procedures are not yet complete, a postponement was requested pending further investigation and apprehension of the main culprit. Patrol Detective Gu Mingzhou reported the details of the bust, presenting the evidence. He stated that he had selected thirteen or fourteen of the defendants, who claimed that the company had hired them as bodyguards and entrusted them with buying six pistols, priced at 330 yuan, with a deposit of 200 yuan paid in advance. When questioned, the defendant Zhang Shengfu stated that he had been hired as an accountant by a friend and had only been there for one day, unaware of the details. The other thirteen defendants all stated that they were either tea servers or shop assistants, and some had not yet been assigned duties. After the interrogation, the court ordered Shen Jifu and the other fifteen to appear in court to be questioned one by one about their registration. The court then announced that the hearing would be adjourned to May 31 for further investigation, and the defendants were temporarily detained in the police station, while Shen Jifu and the others were dismissed pending further notice.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Amicable Settlement Reached in the Bitter Jade Lawsuit Involving the Gongfa Company <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The bitter jade lawsuit in the bankruptcy case of Shanghai Riyue Bank's Gongfa Company, previously filed with the Second Special Court by Liu Baogeng, represented by lawyers Lin Yingqing, against liquidators accountant Pan Zhaobang, Wu Zheng, and Huang Xianzhong, son of Huang Chujiu, seeking joint ownership of the jade, was ruled in favor of Liu Baogeng. Subsequently, the accountants and others, dissatisfied with the original judgment, appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court. A settlement was reached in court before Justice Zhao Zhenhai and clerk Yin Tingxiang. The main points of the settlement are as follows: (1) Appellant Liu Baogeng agreed to abandon his claim of joint ownership of the jade, and the appellants were responsible for seeking the consent of the creditor group that had previously sued the Gongfa Company to repay the appellant 2,700 yuan for washing, cutting, and transportation expenses as a final settlement. The unfinished incense burner, jade waist section, and fourteen pieces of material were to be claimed from the original court by the appellant in the name of Baohua Xiang Firm, and entrusted to Yizhen Le for the continuation of the full washing and cutting project within a period of two years. 35% of the sale price of the future finished product will be allocated as wages and all expenses for the appellant to continue the work. Both parties agreed that the settlement was established. (2) The litigation costs of both trials shall be borne equally by both parties.</p>

<p>The Estate is Valued at Over 20 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Samuel No Longer Represents the Plaintiff</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, the estate of Jewish tycoon Hardoon is valued at over 20 million yuan. When Hardoon died, his will was entirely held by his wife. Subsequently, Islah Hardoon applied to the court, claiming that the estate should be equally divided between him and other relatives of the same clan, and hired London lawyer Saar as his counsel. However, yesterday morning, Saar suddenly announced to the press at the British Assize Court that he was no longer representing Islah Hardoon, stating that the reasons for this were morally and professionally inconvenient to announce. Furthermore, Islah Hardoon's previous application for the court to appoint an impartial administrator to manage the disputed property while the lawsuit was pending was also rejected by Sir Glynn, the British Assize Judge, who stated that his reasons were too weak. Sir Glynn also ordered Islah Hardoon to deposit litigation costs in advance to prevent defeat before the case could proceed. However, the plaintiff's lawyer Sulomend replied that the plaintiff was unable to prepare this huge sum, so the case may undergo changes.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Academia Sinica's New Invention in the Research of Domestic Wine Qu <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Zeng Yi, who was previously sent by the Academia Sinica to Sichuan Province to investigate tung oil and discovered the ruins of an ancient volcano, recognized that China's wine imports exceed 6 million taels of silver annually, with Eastern imports accounting for half of that amount. Moreover, domestically produced wine, made using traditional methods, is worth tens of millions of taels of silver annually, but the traditional methods result in low production and cannot compete with foreign wines and alcohol. Furthermore, domestic wine merchants are currently purchasing foreign spirits to mix with drinking wine, which is harmful to health. Therefore, there is a need for research and improvement. Dr. Zeng returned to the Chemical Research Institute of the Academia Sinica to research domestic wine qu. Recently, he extracted several fermentation microbes from wine qu produced in northern China. The wine-making ability of one of these microbes has now been successfully tested. From now on, China's old wine-making methods can be fundamentally scientificized through the success of this experiment. In the future, China's wine-making qu can be completely replaced with a small amount of "Cai bacteria" (named by Dr. Zeng as Cai bacteria in honor of President Cai Yuanpei, who strongly advocated scientific research at the institute). However, the yield is 25% higher than the highest yield obtained from Chinese distilleries. It is reported that the method for producing "Cai bacteria" is extremely convenient. Previously, the production of Chinese wine qu involved many superstitious taboos and took a month. Now, according to Dr. Zeng's new method, it only takes three days. Rice and wheat flour can be used as raw materials, and an artificial incubator or a low-temperature thermostat can be used as equipment. Dr. Zeng is now producing this bacteria on paper, similar to silkworm seed paper, or sealing it in glass tubes for easy mailing, and plans to open a factory in the future to sell it worldwide. It is also reported that the wine-making ability of this "Cai bacteria" is unprecedented and has never been recorded abroad. Previously, Keermaiti of the Pasteur Institute in France extracted a microbe from Annam wine qu with a maximum wine-making power of only 3.5%, while Dr. Zeng's pure "Cai bacteria" can produce more than 20% alcohol, a difference like heaven and earth, and a new contribution to the international academic community. Dr. Zeng's wife, Ms. Hu Ze, who holds a bachelor's degree, also researches wine qu with Dr. Zeng at the institute and discovered a yellow microbe. Its wine-making ability is slightly inferior to "Cai bacteria," but the wine tastes quite good. As there is no name for this bacteria in China, it is proposed to be named "Yang bacteria" to commemorate Mr. Yang Xingfo, who strongly advocated scientific research in China. It is reported that the qu bacteria used in Japanese sake and Chinese Shaoxing wine are of the same family as "Yang bacteria."</p>
<h3 id="e198">Three Kidnappers Executed <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Execution of Kidnappers of Women and Children</p>
<p>Shen Asan, a kidnapper from Wuxi, 20 years old, and Yu Zhulin, a kidnapper from Ningbo, 34 years old, used firearms to organize a gang on November 7 of last year, broke into Jiang Zirong's iron shop on Tiantong Road, kidnapped Jiang's seven-year-old son and family, hid them at No. 15 Huishan Road, and demanded a ransom of 50,000 yuan. The case was discovered, and the detectives of the Huishan Police Station arrested them and sent them to the First Special District Court. After interrogation and clear confession, Shen and Yu were each sentenced to death. Another kidnapper, Jiang Dinghui from Yangzhou, 24 years old, organized a gang on January 10 of this year, kidnapped the widow Wang Yu from No. 71 Taian Lane, North Shaanxi Road, and demanded a ransom. He was arrested by the Huishi Police Station and sent to the Special District Court, where he was sentenced to death and sent to prison for verification. Now, the Special Court has reported the files of the above two cases to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for verification and execution. Yesterday morning was the deadline, and the police sent Shen, Yu, and Jiang to the First Special Court one after another. Magistrate Shen declared to the three criminals that today was the day of execution by firing squad and asked if they had any last words or to notify their families. According to Shen Asan, please send a letter to his brother-in-law Zhang Yaokui at Beimentang, Wuxi, to come to Shanghai to collect his body. Yu Zhulin said he had no last words, but only asked to use the eight yuan found on his person to buy a pair of shoes and socks and two pieces of tin foil. Jiang Dinghui said, please send a letter to Yan Huaiyu at No. 305 Aiwenyi Road, asking him to come and collect his body, and had nothing else to say. He also requested food and wine. Magistrate Shen ordered them to be sent to the local court for execution. The Chinese and Western police then took the three criminals down, along with the files and photos, and escorted them in a prisoner car to the Caohejing execution ground. They also notified the local court, and the prosecutor supervised the execution and verified the identity of the criminals before carrying out the execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Headless Male Corpse in Suzhou Creek <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Neck Cut Very Clean</p>
<p>A headless male corpse floated to the bank of Suzhou Creek near the Xinzha Bridge yesterday morning. After the water patrol team took the corpse ashore, it was discovered that the head of the corpse was missing, and the neck was cut very cleanly. The fingers of both hands of the deceased were also completely cut off. The corpse was wearing a white cloth shirt and blue cloth pants. It is suspected that the deceased was brutally murdered and dismembered before being thrown into the river. Therefore, Shen Xiaohe, the Eleventh District Bailiff, was ordered to report to the local court for an examination.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Wall of Former Tianchan Stage Collapses Late at Night <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately No One Injured Due to Late Hour</p>
<p>Trams on All Routes Detour</p>
<p>The site of the former Tianyi Stage theater on Nanjing Road, between Zhejiang Road and Hubei Road, has been in disrepair for some time. The owner hired workers to dismantle and rebuild it. The site was surrounded by bamboo fences, and the roof had been gradually dismantled, but the four walls were still standing. However, having lost the support, and exposed to the erosion of wind and rain, the walls were in a dangerous state. Suddenly, at around 3:00 AM yesterday, the wall along Hubei Road collapsed with a loud crash, and bricks and stones fell, mixed with mud. Fortunately, it was late at night, and there were no pedestrians or vehicles, so no one was injured. If this had happened during the day, the area, which is usually a busy traffic area, would have suffered serious damage. After the wall collapsed, bricks and stones piled up on the road. It was not possible to clear them at night, so the Public Works Department sent workers to clear them at dawn. Trams on routes 3, 5, and 6 had to pass through the area. Yesterday, due to the obstruction, trams traveling south from the north turned east at the Wulong Risheng Building on Zhejiang Road, and trams traveling north from the south turned east at the Wuma Road intersection and traveled along the Bund to Nanjing Road. Although this was a slight detour, traffic was not inconvenienced. By the afternoon, the remaining bricks and rubble on the road had been completely cleared.</p>
<h3 id="e201">He Shousun <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Requests Divorce from Husband</p>
<p>Married for Thirteen Years Without Children</p>
<p>Husband Abandons Her; She Requests Divorce</p>
<p>He Shousun, a female employee of the Municipal Education Bureau, is currently 37 years old and originally from Jiangxi. In 1920, when Ms. He was 24 years old, she was engaged to Liu Shicheng, a fellow villager, through her parents' arrangement. However, although they have been married for thirteen years, they have had no children due to Liu's hidden illness. In addition, the relationship between the couple is extremely poor, and their interests are completely opposed. For the sake of her future happiness, Ms. He has hired lawyer Shi Lin to petition the First Special District Court for divorce mediation. However, because the conditions proposed by Liu are difficult to accept, the mediation has been unsuccessful. She is now formally filing for divorce against Liu. The petition states that she became engaged to Liu in 1920 and was originally scheduled to marry the following winter. However, Liu suddenly requested a postponement. By February 1922, he deliberately violated customs and insisted on returning to their original hometown of Ganzhou to marry. After the marriage, he was arrogant towards the plaintiff because he disliked the plaintiff's family's poverty. His temperament was also eccentric, and he often scolded and quarreled. The plaintiff tolerated him as much as possible, so she was often silent. During the summer vacation of 1925, the plaintiff wanted to return to Nanchang to visit her father and notified the defendant before departure, agreeing to go together. However, he was slow to act, which clearly showed his wealth and unwillingness to live with the plaintiff. In 1931, the defendant held a position in the Secretariat of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, earning a substantial income. He often took leave to come to Shanghai, but always stayed elsewhere, unwilling to see the plaintiff. Even if he visited, he would avoid her, as if she was a stranger. There was no affection to speak of. It was found that the defendant had been diagnosed by a doctor eight years ago as having physiological changes that made it difficult to have children. Therefore, although the plaintiff had conceived once, the fetus died in the womb. Although the doctor removed the corpse by surgery, the position of her waist and abdominal muscles has been distorted ever since, and she has had no children to this day. This is really affected by the defendant's chronic disease. For the sake of descendants, for the sake of family happiness, and to avoid the pain of both parties, she specifically applied for mediation. However, when the court held a mediation hearing on April 23, the defendant did not appear in court. His lawyer instead asked the plaintiff to continue to live with him and bear the responsibility of support, resulting in unsuccessful mediation. As the defendant suffers from an incurable disease and has abandoned her, she requests that a divorce be granted. Magistrate Yang of the First Special Court opened a hearing yesterday morning. The defendant, Liu Shicheng, is currently employed at the Hangyuan Telegraph Bureau. After receiving the summons, he immediately came to Shanghai and surrendered to the court with his representative lawyer. Magistrate Yang then questioned them, stating that both parties were intellectuals and had been married for many years. They should live together for a long time, and why should they rush to divorce? He advised both parties to go outside and conduct a settlement. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<p>Zhang Baoqing, a famous martial arts master, and his entire class of more than 20 people, came to Shanghai to perform, as reported in the previous newspaper. Fan Yixiang, the general manager of Yihua Company in this city, introduced by Pan Yihua, hosted a welcome dinner for them at the Guangshengyuan Restaurant on Nanjing Road last night, with Zheng Xitao and others accompanying them. They drank happily. During the dinner, Mr. Zhang described in detail his performances in various European countries over the past 15 years. According to Mr. Zhang's ambition, China's technology sector should organize a large-scale group, hire interpreters proficient in various foreign languages, and go to European and American countries to promote China's national skills. This would not only absorb foreign money but also win glory for the country, so that it would no longer be despised by foreigners and laughed at as the "Sick Man of East Asia." It is reported that the programs that Mr. Zhang and his entire class will perform at Summer Peak tomorrow are all skills honed over 20 years, with divine courage and agility, making people speechless.

<h3 id="e208">A Simple Explanation of Acquiring Knowledge <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Lai Zha</p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have always enjoyed reading philosophy because philosophy is the key to studying all sciences. I translate philosophy as "the study of acquiring knowledge" because only with "acquiring knowledge" can one then "investigate things." Only with logic can one then begin to research.</p>
<p>The more I read philosophy, the more interested I became. I lit Western candles at night and read late into the night, until my eyesight became nearsighted.</p>
<p>At that time, buying books was really difficult. Ships from Europe had to go around the Cape of Good Hope, making a large circle. Writing a letter to order a book would take one or two years to get a reply. Later, the Suez Canal opened (Editor's note: The Suez Canal opened in 1869), and ships could pass through the canal, pulled by horses on the shore, making transportation more convenient.</p>
<p>I believe that the best philosophical works are in Latin. I once compiled a textbook for Aurora University called "A Simple Explanation of Acquiring Knowledge." Later, I revised it and had it published by the Commercial Press. This "Simple Explanation of Acquiring Knowledge" was compiled based on several of the most basic Latin writers. In my translation of various terms, I often used Buddhist and Taoist terminology. For example, "Individu" is usually translated as "individual," but I translated it as "juziti" [局自體, roughly "self-contained entity"], which is a term from Buddhist scriptures. For example, the space occupied by volume, I called "fangwei" [方位, "location"], which is also a term from Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p>"A Simple Explanation of Acquiring Knowledge" only covers the section on terminology. However, reading this book will reveal the shortcomings of the Chinese language.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Humorous Tales from the Wisteria Pavilion <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>Since the assassination of Japan's Inukai Cabinet, the military's arrogance has been rampant. Fascism is rising to a fever pitch. The party cabinet is on the verge of collapse. Indeed. News arrived that the "Wood Cabinet" (Suzuki) disappeared. The "Wisteria Cabinet" (Saito) rose. It is seen that from now on, Japanese militarists will gain power, and party politics will hang by a thread. As the "Wisteria Cabinet" is just beginning its tenure, I will express my humble views as humorous tales.</p>
<p>The wisteria, as a material, is both firm and strong, possessing both hardness and softness. Japan's foreign policy has always combined threats and enticements. It is said to be good at using both its soft and hard strengths. From now on, Saito's administration will increasingly show its old wisteria bark face, pulling and dragging.</p>
<p>Wisteria is a plant that lives by climbing on trees. This time, Saito's cabinet is "wisteria" in name, and he is only following the lead of Araki's "wood". This is also expected.</p>
<p>Some may say, Suzuki is also "wood." Why did it yield to wisteria? I say, Suzuki's wood, although not rotten wood, is only wood tied to a bell. It is ultimately not a great vessel. Therefore, it is not enough to support a large building, unlike the strong fruit of old wisteria.</p>
<p>Others ask me, If we discuss the meaning of the name "Saito Cabinet," can we also infer its policies? I say, Wisteria, as a material, wraps around every gap. If one tree is not enough, it goes to another. It is the most aggressive of plants. The policies of the Wisteria Cabinet may be just like that. Japanese officials with "wisteria" in their names are seen in the newspapers, such as Sato, Kato, and Ito. Now, Saito is added, shining together, and the Japanese cabinet can be considered a wisteria ware shop.</p>
<p>Mr. Chan-jia read the meaning of my article and laughed, Wisteria is not only for making canes and weaving yellow wisteria objects. There is also loofah vine for loofah, watermelon vine for watermelon, prickly hair vine for stinging people, and wolfberry vine for making dishes.</p>
<p>I say, That's right. This is truly "a dog dies, then wisteria". "Inu" (dog) died and Saito succeeded. What else could it be if not "a dog dies, then wisteria"? Those who heard it all applauded.</p>

<p>(It has not been two months since Lingxi returned to his hometown. Looking at Jiyuan and his maternal grandfather's old residence from the boat, he felt sad and wanted to cry.)</p>
<p>At dawn, the stream rushes. For whom are the oarsmen urging in the wind? The flowers on the shore and the red sun are irresistibly beautiful, just illuminating the eyebrows of people. Fleeting years pass quickly, exchanged for a jade coffin poured eastward by turbulent waves. The fragrant soul fondly remembers the ink-wash homeland. The white-haired subject of Du Fu. The daytime horn sounds from the river sky. End the war-torn alarm; the cuckoo cries bitterly. The weeds in the mortuary do not become spring. Remembering Prince Wang's road of death. Wearing white linen like snow, the twilight approaches. Arriving at the river bridge, how desolate to complain. Enduring long-term regrets, transform into a round ice. Deep at night, illuminate you.</p>

<p>(Remembering Miss Su when the car passed Bansong Garden; she wanted to visit when she was in Shanghai but never did.)</p>
<p>Again, the dream car dust is blown up. The painted garden pavilions, heartbreaking to see. The mirror railing, spring waves, I wanted to arrive then but never did. The smoke-dried peach blossoms dye the willows, replacing the taste of sorrow. Tearful eyes look at the orioles, asking if there are flower-front bells and pendants. The porter sighs at the graceful shadows, buried in the singing of five sighs. Wildly joyous Shanghai city, letting go of the watery weather. The remaining lonely swallows in the east wind argue about returning to the tortoiseshell beam. Counting the drunken eyes and lamp lips, everything is avoided for her sake.</p>
<h3 id="e212">A Scene from Military Life <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Hanlu</p>
<p>On the day of visiting the troops in Kunshan and Taicang, the sound of sentry gunfire could be heard continuously. Although the situation was very serious, all the officers and soldiers were calm and happy. There was absolutely no sense of the terror of war.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze wafted the melodious sound of a record, faintly discernible as a section from the Cantonese opera "Willow Shakes Gold." In the trenches, one could often see a special kind of military equipment: gramophones. This was indeed their only source of entertainment.</p>
<p>On the exercise ground under Ma'an Mountain, many armed comrades were working hard in a football competition. The referee was a young officer. His interest was as strong as in school life. Others, engaged in national martial arts performances and martial arts competitions, showed even greater courage and exuberance.</p>
<p>A small team of soldiers was seriously engaged in "crossing the river" exercises. On the riverbank, they took off their military uniforms and pants, raised their pistols and rifles, and waded through the cold, muddy river, shouting and struggling. When they reached the shore, everyone was very excited and did not even mind their muscles turning red from the cold.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Shen, who was leading the tour, gave us a brief explanation. He said, "We firmly believe that in order to strengthen combat capabilities, spiritual strength is more important than material things. Our military training method focuses on the realization of the 'militarization of the military' and aims to make the brothers' lives happy, lively, and interesting. Therefore, in addition to daily exercises, the promotion of various entertainment activities has gradually become a regular routine."</p>
<p>I could not help but admire the Nineteenth Route Army's perfect organization and great spirit. At the same time, associating the military entertainment with a recent audio-visual national film "Silver Star Luck," which combined various songs and games, gave me spiritual pleasure. The "Victory Gong and Drum," among other things, hinted at the deep meaning of saving the country. It can be seen that in times of national crisis, there is no need to abandon proper entertainment.</p>
<p>On the vast return journey, a scene from military life kept appearing. Also thinking, mental consolation to the soldiers, "Silver Star Luck" is indeed a good contribution. However, it is best to drink heartily on the day of capturing Huanglong [the enemy's capital].</p>

<p>— Yinhong</p>
<p>Recently, in Ohio, USA, a young engineer named Woodfud is engaged in manufacturing a rocket that flies seven miles per second. He intends to use this for traveling to the moon. He claims that he can reach the moon in 200 hours.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, Mr. Wood is not the first American to dream of visiting the Moon Palace. Several years ago, a man named Cookhtan approached the famous astronomer Camille Klamarion with the same plan, inviting him to be a travel companion. Mr. Klamarion's reply was quite humorous, saying that he could not leave his post, but if the brave warrior made a second trip, he would definitely accompany him.</p>
<p>Mr. Cookhtan also put aside his original plan. It was probably because Mr. Klamarion did not agree to go with him.</p>

<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>"Have you ever seen these things with your own eyes?" I asked.</p>
<p>As we were discussing this issue, suddenly a deafening sound came, drumming, cymbals, and bells, sent from the temple across the street. These girls shouted in unison:</p>
<p>"What cruel actions these are!"</p>
<p>"Have you met Mr. Gandhi recently? What do you think of him?" I asked.</p>
<p>"He said he was fine, but I said to him, 'Why do I only see your bones?' But he said he must feel fine."</p>
<p>"But he said his diet has now changed. He no longer eats sheep's milk but eats raisins and fruit juice."</p>
<p>"What did he think after Miss Slade was arrested?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I told him that they had taken Mirabehn away, but he said, 'Yes, they have taken her away.' He had already known about this."</p>
<p>"He knew everything. He had told me before that she was going to be arrested, and everything he predicted would come true."</p>
<p>"What exactly happened to those cruel things?" the young man shouted. At that time, the noise from across the street seemed even more intense. Crackle, crackle, like thunder in a rainstorm.</p>
<p>"What are your plans now, Madam?" I asked. "Do you want to go back to prison and be a prisoner again?"</p>
<p>"My plan is to continue working for the motherland," she replied. "Serving for the motherland, everything is left to God's disposal. We"</p>
<p>"Should be patient, and I am preparing for something unfortunate to happen!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Gandhi stood up, gave the Indian farewell greeting, and shook hands with me. At the same time, the young man refused to deny it, insisting that those cruel events had happened again.</p>
<p>"Okay, so what exactly happened?" I asked him, and it was the first time I had spoken to him.</p>
<p>He stared at me intently for a while.</p>
<p>"Have you seen those things?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then, personally, do you know anyone who does these things?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Child," I said, "there is only one rule here. No matter what, I cannot believe anything to be true that I have not seen."</p>
<p>"So what is this then?" he shouted.</p>
<p>"Wind," was my answer. At the same time, I bowed and left.</p>

<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Boundless Sorrow and Resentment in Repentance; It's Difficult to Hope for Open-Mindedness; Extreme Singing and Dancing; Enjoyment Reveals Authority</p>
<p>Sure enough, with just this little bit of something, you won her true heart's delight, and she was extremely willing to help you vigorously. On the spot, she invited Military Governor Ye to come, and she agreed in person. Your matter can be considered nine and nine-tenths complete. There is also a person named Mao Deshun, who is the youngest son of Mao, the music teacher who used to play the huqin and teach opera. He often followed his father to serve in our hall. He used to play the yueqin. Now that he has grown up, he has joined Fifth Madam's place. He has been promoted and changed his profession to become Fifth Madam's personal adjutant. When I saw him, I also gave him some money, because I heard that Military Governor Ye is very difficult to meet. You can't compare to me being able to enter and exit the halls and rooms at will. Go directly to Fifth Madam to find a way. In the future, if you go to see Old Ye alone, you may inevitably encounter obstacles. Then you can use this little Mao to find an opportunity to lead you in. Most likely, little Mao will arrange everything properly in half a day and personally invite you. You only need to prepare how you should speak when you see Old Ye. Make sure that what you say is in tune with him, and then you can achieve the greatest purpose. An Yutian hurriedly smiled and said, "You are really capable. I don't understand any of these ways. If it weren't for you helping me, I wouldn't have even dreamed of doing this. I will have to trouble you to teach me often in the future." Liang Xiaoyun smiled triumphantly and silently pondered. Then she thought of many questions, and gradually brought them up one by one for detailed discussion with An Yutian, and to study the future position and the ultimate hope. An Yutian thought that his qualifications were shallow and his influence was small, and that his requests should not be too extravagant. If he could get a leisurely job now, he would be satisfied. But she resolutely advocated that since things are going so smoothly, a good opportunity should not be missed. Simply try to get some real power and become a higher-level officer in charge of troops. At the very least, you should get a colonel's regiment leader of the infantry. Even if there is no ready-made vacancy to fill, you can still request to establish a new team and recruit troops yourself. I have already told Old Ye that you have such reputation and strength in this hometown. Whether it is to recruit bandits or incorporate militia, you can immediately call for many people. Just ask Old Ye to issue a commission and give you the title of a brigade commander or commander. I guarantee that you can exert effort and repay Old Ye. When An Yutian heard this, he was shocked and jumped up, waving his hands and said, "You are saying things too flamboyantly and without limit. Although it is said that in today's world, one should not be too honest, you still have to exaggerate a little. But I absolutely do not have such great ability to brag and exaggerate like you. After bragging, how can I manage to do it in the future? Wouldn't it eventually become a joke?"</p>

<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, the market was very sluggish, and the trend was difficult to invigorate. Judging from the current situation, there was little hope for the interest rate on foreign currency, and credit was also very loose. Therefore, there was nothing significant to record in the market. As for the banking industry, as it is the end of the accounting period, various major trades were generally neglected, resulting in a rather cold and quiet market.</p>

<p>The May Term Will Be Suspended Today in Preparation for Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday's Prices Rebounded Slightly, and the Market Situation Improved Slightly</p>
<p>Due to the approaching end-of-month settlement period at the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, trading of May futures will be suspended from today to allow for the handling of various procedures before settlement. Settlement will be implemented this Friday. Yesterday was the last day of trading for May futures. Yesterday's spot market situation for various bonds showed few spot transactions, with only 11,500 yuan traded throughout the day. Futures were slightly better than the previous day. The market situation was slightly calmer than before. The morning turnover was over 1.6 million, and the afternoon turnover was 1.2 million, totaling 2.885 million yuan. Among them, the turnover of unified salt tax reduction and disbandment bonds and 19th Customs bonds was relatively high at 400,000, while most others were only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Whole sixth customs tax, 96 series, and unauthorized bonds were still relatively quiet. As for the trend of various bonds, the morning market was the most stagnant. The market supply and demand situation continued to be extremely balanced, and the price decline was minimal, with almost no change from the previous day. In the afternoon, there was more replenishment in the market, and the selling side showed a dispersed trend. As a result, various prices rebounded uniformly, but the trend remained peaceful. In the end, compared to the previous day, only the whole sixth next month's term, the 96 series current month's term, and the reduction and disbandment spot goods decreased slightly by a few 角. Other bonds rose by about two or three 角. The future of the bond market is still extremely stable for the time being.</p>

<p>Total Daily Volume Only 600,000 Shares</p>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Silver Company)</p>
<p>Traders still maintained a cautious wait-and-see attitude on Monday, and the market remained extremely quiet. The morning market had once risen, but speculators immediately sold off for slight profits. The afternoon market fell several points compared to the end of last week. The daily turnover was 600,000 shares, a low ebb not seen since 1924. The New York Stock Exchange is currently almost inactive. It is difficult to expect improvement until various efforts to overcome the economic downturn have made substantial progress. The Dow Jones Daily Index is attached as follows:</p>

<p>Too Few Transactions... Slight Fluctuations</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is becoming increasingly sluggish, and the situation is very bleak. Trading in the market is becoming increasingly deserted, and there is no hope of prosperity for the time being. Due to the small number of transactions, fluctuations are minimal. The inventory in the exchange is 84,050 bales, most of which are two-account bales, with an actual quantity of only 11,200 bales. Some are very dissatisfied with the previous settlement prices. The current financial situation has not recovered to a loose state, and the Guangdong Navy issue remains unresolved. Due to these various reasons, the future situation is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Manbiao Slightly Up Two, Three, Four, Five Qian <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>The Manbiao market opened in the morning, with a slight increase in foreign cotton and firm gold prices. Sellers in the market were slightly lacking, and each month rose two, three, four Qian. The afternoon market became weaker, with each month rising or falling one or two Qian. The total daily transaction volume was only 3,700 bales. Ruida sold 450 bales, Shenji 250 bales, Gengfeng 200 bales, Rongxing 100 bales, and Heshen 100 bales. Jifeng bought 450 bales, Yukang 250 bales, Dachangcheng 300 bales, Yiyuan 250 bales, and Yuantai 450 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The spot yarn market is extremely dispersed, and the brokers of various groups are very sluggish. Only the Sichuan group is more active. The total statistics of purchases by various groups throughout the day were 950 bales. The market was flat. The customer side Sichuan group entered 700 bales, the inland entered 78 bales, Hong Kong entered 50 bales, Shantou entered 15 bales, Ningbo entered 30 bales, the Northern group entered 2 bales, Fujian entered 25 bales, Guangdong entered 10 bales, and the industry entered 52 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is slightly firmer, and US cotton has risen slightly, leading to good sentiment. Some shorts covered their positions, and the market price rebounded. However, the overall situation is still calm. Because the inventory of foreign cotton is too thick, factories have sufficient raw materials, and there are no inquiries about domestic cotton. However, those outside the industry generally believe that the current climate is not suitable, and they are deeply concerned that it will hinder the progress of new cotton. However, the time is still early, and the impact is small.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Zhengbiao Has Some Short Covering <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The Zhengbiao market opened in the morning, and US cotton rose again. The buying sentiment in the market was stronger, and each month rose 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, the near month rose 0.15 yuan, and the far month rose 0.05 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 4,400 dan. Dafeng sold 300 dan, Changhe 700 dan, Yifeng 500 dan, and Yuanda 300 dan. Yicheng bought 600 dan, and Xinheng 1,300 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton rose due to excessive rainfall and short covering. There was a lack of sellers, and the market was calm and firm. Futures rose 7 to 8 points, and spot goods rose 10 points. UK cotton futures rose 3 points, and spot goods fell 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell 10 points. Indian cotton market closed.

<p>Cocoon Merchants Have Virtually Stopped Weighing</p>
<p>This year's cocoon production in various cities and towns near Chang'an has been affected by the weather, with a total reduction of no more than 20%. Cocoon merchants have been opening for several days, but the limited prices set are too low. The highest price for improved foreign breeds of cocoons is only 30 to 35 yuan. Silkworm farmers all claim that the losses are too great, and they are generally using their own stoves to dry the cocoons. Therefore, in the past two days, there have been very few cocoons arriving in the market. Cocoon merchants have virtually stopped weighing, and the fresh cocoons they have collected have all been dried into dry cocoons, packed, and stored at the station, waiting for loading and transportation. A large amount of dry cocoons will be transported to Shanghai in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Wuxi Fresh Cocoons Listed <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday, the local silk market of foreign firms was quiet and lifeless. Due to the abundance of artificial silk and Japanese silk in overseas markets, telegrams from China were not being forwarded. Various silk firms insisted on prices, and merchants who bought Chinese silk suffered heavy losses. The market was quiet. Only Taihe entered 5 bales of Liuqin brand top-grade white silk from Qili, priced at 575 taels. Kechang entered 6 bales of Weiyichang brand top-grade yellow coarse silk from Guopen, priced at 345 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Red and Green Tea Transactions Brisk <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local tea market of foreign firms was quite brisk. Red teas such as Qimen Fugu and green teas such as Luzhuang and Tuzhuang Zhenmei and Zhenmei needles saw a total transaction volume of 3,416 boxes throughout the city. Although the market for red tea was slightly looser than before, it did not fall sharply, as everyone was aware that the cost price was high and was unwilling to make excessive concessions. Although there were negotiations on Tunxi Zhenmei yesterday, no agreement was reached. Chinese merchants' attitudes have become more stable than before, so the market for Suian Zhenmei has not changed. In addition, due to the establishment of the French firm Yongxing Foreign Firm, the market for Zhenmei needles has become brisk. The selling price of goods from Luzhuang has increased to 79 taels, an increase of 7 or 8 taels from the previous time. The trend of the tea market has gradually entered the right track.</p>

<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the goods from Road 17 and 18 on the west side were in great demand. Su Tong group and Ping Li North all rose by one 角. Buyers were eager, and it was believed that the source of Grain-in-Ear must be abundant, so they sold as they came. Qingjiao Siyi thin rice consistently rose nearly one 角. The arrival of Lu Yang pointed rice was dwindling, but the existing inventory was lacking. Bian Yin Yuan's sales were flat, and the market did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday's source was Road 23 and 24, and the market was quite refreshing. The top goods of Northern Whip and each grade of Zhongguan were raised by one 角. There were slight arrivals of early and late rice, and there was slight entertainment for inland and re-export groups. Yang Lu Jian was sold as soon as it arrived, and the price was as before. Glutinous rice arrived in three barrels yesterday, and all numbers of 斛 were sold, and the market rose by one or two 角.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Foreign Rice Rises by One 角 <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation was that, due to a good report of rain for Domi, people's hearts were already leaning upward. Moreover, customer transformation was also seeing prosperity. The Shanghai-Ningbo Railway has already opened, and the officials along the line were becoming more comfortable. Wuxi and Nanjing were more lively, and Chongming and Jiangbei also had inquiries. The market was up by a large 角 compared to the previous market. It was estimated that more than 10,000 bags of Xiaojiao were opened, priced at 10.071 yuan to 10.043 yuan. There were 1,200 bags of old Xiaojiao rough rice, priced at 9.37 yuan. 1,000 bags of Mindang rice were priced at 11.05 yuan. 100 bags of Jia Ladi rough rice were priced at 10 yuan. 400 tons of Mindang rice for delivery in two or three weeks were priced at 5.25 taels.</p>

<p>The spot powder market was still quiet yesterday, with only 5,000 to 6,000 bags traded throughout the city. However, the factory prices were raised, and people's hearts were slightly better. The spot goods of the warship opened at 2.04 taels, seemingly better than the previous day by 0.005 tael. Fuxin's rotation also opened at 0.04 yuan. The Red and Blue Car Factory had no sales openings, and the return goods also rose slightly, opening at 2.0425 taels to 2.05 taels. Because there were no chips on the market, the other grades had no transactions. Only the factory had sporadic sales channels.</p>

<p>Tong'an Round Longans Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>"Longkou Vermicelli" has been lacking in continued arrivals recently. The inventory on the market is still thin, and the customer goods have risen to 19.8 liang per town, which is better than before by 0.3. Therefore, the market is tight. Yesterday, Longkou vermicelli was sold at 20.02 yuan, and the second at 20 yuan. Sales were still active, and the situation was stable.</p>
<p>"Tong'an Longans" have been lacking in arrivals for a long time, and the inventory on the market is also lacking. Yesterday, Taiyuan Fu entered a batch from Fengmenkou, with a total of only ten boxes. It was said that there were both large and medium sizes, but the large size of the market was weak due to the inventory of Quan Pao. The medium size was more scarce and will definitely sell well.</p>

<p>Black Pepper Sales Sluggish, Market Loose</p>
<p>Black Pepper: Customer sales have been inactive in recent days, and there is also a large inventory. Production areas have also fallen, and the market has gradually loosened. Yesterday, it was heard that the price of 200 bags of Heida was 42 taels, and the price of 100 bags of No. 1 was 42.5 taels. Brokers did not dare to hoard, and key personnel were unusually sluggish. In this situation, unless the sales field moves greatly, there is a risk of further declines.</p>
<p>Mushrooms: Old goods were cleared early, and the new goods were harvested quite abundantly this year, so goods have been arriving from all routes recently. Yesterday, 106 pieces of Tunxi goods arrived, with large, good pieces priced at 214.5 taels, high uniform pieces at 191 taels to 187.5 taels, ordinary pieces at 165 taels, and secondary to 149.5 taels. Many importers were still arriving, and the goods were cleared as they arrived.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the Chinese tallow sales market, the situation has been active. It is heard that various soap factories in the local area have also been importing, but it is not as prosperous as in previous years. Summer sales rely entirely on soap factories, because the candle-making market has already stopped work. The goods prepared by Bayoutou brokers are generally for soap making, so the goods do not seek high quality, but only take cheap prices to be cost-effective. It is heard that recent sales openings are around 21 liang, slightly more, sent to the soap factory for weighing. Recently, the price of butter is also cheaper, only slightly less than 20 liang, so manufacturers calculate that butter is cheaper. For this reason, the Bayoutou market seems to be hindered, but the manufacture of high-quality scented soap cannot abandon Chinese tallow and use butter alone. Therefore, the sales of Chinese tallow to soap factories are not completely hopeless. The inventory of local oil and wax brokers is not abundant, because commercial recovery has not been possible for a while after the war, or they are unwilling to prepare too much. However, it is heard that the source in Hankou is not prosperous, and the sales market is still clear, and the accumulated inventory is thin. Now that the price has fallen to this step, there seems to be no risk of further declines.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Woolen Piece Goods Market Moving Downward <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the price of woolen goods has been falling, sales are sluggish, and the market situation is weak. If the white goods for summer are timely, the selling prices have fallen one after another. Zhu Luosha, which previously sold for more than 8 qian, is now reduced to 6 qian 7-8 fen. The old brand white jili of 记盗仙草一一一一顿号, wholesale price per yard is 4.25 taels, and if there are customer transactions, the seller is still willing to make concessions. This product was sold for 5.25 taels last year, a difference of 1 tael. Various French blue wools continued to move downward in the market yesterday. In short, due to the gradual heat of the weather, the sales of woolen goods are expected to be clear, and the market situation is weak. It is not until the autumn season that there is little hope for progress.</p>

<p>After the enamel factory stopped purchasing enamel iron, the market has been silent. The standard is poor due to poor environmental conditions, resulting in a downward trend. The cheapest price is 8.8 taels for 26-foot iron, 9 taels for 36-foot fine patterns, and 8.25 taels for coarse patterns. However, there are still few large businesses. However, in recent days, the business of customer groups seems to be trending, so more than 500 to 600 dan have been opened. However, the market price is still not easy to raise, such as 8.9 taels for 26-foot iron and 9.2 taels (fine patterns) and 8.4 taels (coarse patterns) for 36-foot iron.</p>

<p>Recently, the trading of American white lead has been unusually quiet, because customer groups and factories rarely decorate, and copper coin bureaus and ordnance factories, which used to be called畅销, have also been rarely purchasing. Therefore, the market situation is unusually萧条, and the standard is therefore loosening. Currently, each load is estimated at 18 liang, which is 0.5 liang lower than before. It is heard that the price can be cheaper for large-scale transactions, and the market price of miscellaneous brands is only around 16 liang, but transactions are also very冷落.</p>

<p>The sales of Datong anthracite chunks have been sluggish for the past two weeks. Daily market transactions are only 20 to 30 tons, and the plate price has therefore fallen. Yesterday's market price was only 15 liang per ton, or even 14.7 to 14.8 yuan, which could also be purchased. The whereabouts of its unified coal are also滞, and only the foreign warships have slightly purchased it, and the price is 13 liang per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e248">The Ghost in the Tall House in England <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Fo</p>
<p>The question of whether ghosts and gods exist has been debated in our country for thousands of years and has not yet been resolved. Now, strangely, it has happened in England, the world of science.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, in Liverpool, England, a large house has been haunted in recent years. Men are pushed down the stairs by ghosts, and women are thrown into the hall by ghosts, causing the neighbors to be terrified. It is truly strange. Confucius did not talk about ghosts, forces, and chaos, and did not dare to say there were no ghosts, but simply did not talk about them. He also said to respect ghosts and gods and keep them at a distance. If there are no ghosts and gods, why respect them? It seems that Confucius still advocated dualism. During the Six Dynasties, Xiao Ziliang was devoted to Buddhism, and Fan Zhen strongly argued that there was no Buddha. Zhen also wrote a theory of destroying gods, believing that form is the substance of the spirit, and the spirit is the function of form. The relationship between the spirit and form is like the sharpness of a knife. It has never been heard that the sharpness survives when the knife is gone. Ziliang could not refute him. Fan Zhen absolutely advocated monism.</p>
<p>However, according to what I have heard, there are countless strange books in our country. Even the facts heard and seen from friends cannot be exhausted. Therefore, I take the essence and use it widely, to scare Bo You. It is not impossible to speculate with common sense. Even Dr. Wu Tingfang had the theory of communication between humans and ghosts. A certain British spiritualist also said that there are five ghosts that can be talked to directly.</p>
<p>Recently, "scientists" and "metaphysicians" have been arguing with each other, incompatible with each other. I think it is because science has not been fully developed. If the study of the soul is researched using scientific methods, it will definitely be possible to successfully create a specialized field of learning.</p>

<p>The scars of Songhu have not yet faded, how can the agreement be signed! Looking north, the soul is broken, and the beacon fire connects the clouds at Yuguan. Within the country, hideous iron fists are used, and demons and monsters display their means. It is heard that chickens and insects are fighting, and the southern sky is full of conflicts.</p>

<p>I remember Jiading as a scenic spot in Jiangnan, but I hate that it has been repeatedly ravaged by war in recent years. Endless suffering from relocation and displacement, unbearable exhaustion in people's lives. I, Jialing, took the lead in regaining it, and it has been twenty-one years since the Xinhai Revolution. The sound of revolution spread for the second time, and battles broke out between the north and south, starting beacon fires. Since then, more than ten years of fleeting time, the local area has been clean and peaceful. Who knew that the situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang would arise, and wars and conflicts would disrupt the end of the year. Suddenly hearing the sound of planes coming from the sky, this spring again faced the beginning of disaster. How can a famous town be a scarred place? Fortunately, the entire city was not burned to ashes.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Manufacturing Blue-Black Ink <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Yi Yun</p>
<p>Blue-black ink, also known as iron gall ink. It is made by mixing iron salts, tannic acid, and blue pigments. When iron salts and tannic acid meet, they form ferrous tannate, which is colorless. However, when exposed to air, it quickly oxidizes to form black ferric tannate. This is why the ink is blue when it is written and turns blue-black after a while.</p>
<p>To make it, place four grams of tannic acid in a beaker (glass beaker is also acceptable), add 300 cubic centimeters of water and heat until the tannic acid is completely dissolved, and then let it sit to cool. Separately, dissolve five grams of green alum (i.e., ferrous sulfate) in 100 cubic centimeters of water. If the liquid appears yellow, add a few drops of dilute sulfuric acid to restore its original blue color. Then, dissolve three grams of blue pigment in 200 cubic centimeters of water and stir to dissolve it. Add three grams of gum arabic (approximately 10 cubic centimeters) and then add five cubic centimeters of glycerin and one or two drops of carbonic acid (carbonic acid is to prevent the ink from becoming moldy).</p>
<p>Add the ferrous sulfate solution to the cooled tannic acid solution. Then add this mixed solution to the pigment solution. Then dilute it with 500 cubic centimeters of water. After stirring evenly, filter it with filter paper or summer cloth, put it into a bottle, and plug it with a wooden stopper. Then you can take it and use it at any time. (translated directionpapor)</p>
<p>I and my classmates made it according to this quantity before, and the concentration was very appropriate. It is really more than not as good as the goods sold on the market. If it is too light, you can heat it to reduce the amount of water in it. If it is too thick, you can add water to dilute it. If you accidentally get ink on your body, washing it with water is not effective, but washing it with lemon juice will remove it.</p>
<p>Note: The method of making ink has been published in a previous article in this publication. This article is slightly different from the previous method, so it is disclosed again on the right. - Editor</p>

<p>Pigments are not only used for painting, but also as a major raw material for paints. They can also be used for dyeing and making inks, and their uses are very extensive. A detailed description is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) Prussian Blue: One gram of yellow blood salt and six grams of ferric oxide.</p>
<p>(2) Scarlet: Equal amounts of potassium iodide and mercuric chloride.</p>
<p>(3) Barium White: Equal amounts of barium sulfide and zinc sulfate.</p>
<p>(4) Chrome Yellow: Ten grams of lead acetate and six grams of potassium chromate.</p>
<p>Dissolve each of the above substances separately in water, then mix them together and let stand for a while. Filter, wash the pigment powder two or three times with water, dry it, and grind it to form pigments of various colors.</p>
<p>(5) Chrome Orange: Add a little caustic soda solution to chrome yellow and heat together to form orange color.</p>
<p>(6) Green: Mix barium white, Prussian blue, and chrome yellow to create various shades of green, from grass green to deep green.</p>
<p>Add a few drops of linseed oil to the above pigments, mix well, then add a few drops of turpentine to form paints of various colors.</p>
<p>The filtrate obtained from the previous filtration contains potassium oxide, potassium acetate, and zinc sulfide. It can be stored in separate bottles for other uses. Due to limited space, it will be described in another article.</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Mr. Yi has been very poor recently. His own salary has long been used up, and he even has to borrow money from friends for pocket change. But a few days ago, he received a letter from his wife, saying that she and a three-year-old baby were both sick. Especially the lively and lovely child, now has almost only a last thread of life remaining... At the end of the letter, she repeatedly urged him to send money back immediately.</p>
<p>Of course, the main thing is to send money back. With money, he could send them to the hospital. Naturally, a foreign hospital would be the most reliable. If they stayed in the hospital, that adorable child would surely be saved. Ah! That adorable child!...</p>
<p>But where is the money? Where is the money? What's more, it needs to be sent immediately!</p>
<p>He visited all his friends, he thought over and over again in bed, unable to sleep all night. Finally, he came up with a solution: his wife still had a piece of Indian silk long dress left in the box, and his own lined robe was no longer needed. Humph! These should at least be worth fifteen dollars, right? This is just enough to help with the immediate crisis. But the lined robe was very dirty. If it wasn't washed first, no one would want it. Finally, he decided to send it to the laundry.</p>
<p>So he felt a little more at ease. However, his wife's thin, crying face and the child's weak breathing constantly floated in his mind.</p>
<p>After enduring four very depressed days, he took back from the laundry this piece of clothing that could save his child's life. He felt even more comfortable in his heart. An hint of a smile, not seen in recent days, couldn't help but appear on his face. But he still had to check it. If there were holes in the clothes, it wouldn't fetch a good price. But, oh dear, sure enough, unfortunately, there was a big hole in a very obvious place at the lower fold. Who would want this?... There was no way to think, he could only send it to the tailor shop again.</p>
<p>"Hey! Please fix this for me quickly."</p>
<p>"Okay, sir: come back tomorrow night to pick it up."</p>
<p>"Can't you do it any faster?"</p>
<p>"Sir! That's really not possible."</p>
<p>He had another sleepless night. As soon as he fell asleep, he saw that his child had already died, and his wife was crying hoarsely beside him. So he also cried loudly, tearing his hair and beating his chest... Waking up, he was covered in cold sweat. "Ah! Luckily, it was just a dream. But this is an ominous omen! But it will definitely be able to send it the day after tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>Upon waking up early in the morning, he prepared himself to anxiously wait until evening, with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>At lunch, he received another piece of bad news, which was that the postal workers were on strike. How could this be? A telegraphic transfer was impossible. Fortunately, he discovered in the newspaper that airmail was not on strike, but whether money could be sent was still a question... No matter what, wait until he had the money in hand tonight before saying anything.</p>
<p>The lights were on, he was at the tailor shop.</p>
<p>"Sir! I'm really sorry, we're too busy, everyone is rushing to make summer clothes. Sir's is autumn clothing. It's no longer necessary to wear it now, please come back in a few days."</p>
<p>"But... Ah!"</p>
<p>Did he explain? No, he still didn't. How could he have the nerve to say it? So he walked out of the store as if he had suffered a serious injury.</p>
<p>"Ah! My child!... I see your face!"</p>
<p>When he went home, his face was covered...</p>

<h3 id="e254">Barristers <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Recently, it seems that there are already enough barristers in Shanghai. We can see the signboards of "XXX Barrister," "XX Joint Law Office" everywhere, displayed in a dazzling array. However, the "barrister manufacturing plant" is still producing them in batches. I'm afraid that in the near future, there will be a barrister every five steps on the street, and a law office every ten steps, making it extremely lively.</p>
<p>The first thing a barrister does on the day they open their practice is to post an advertisement. The first and most fundamental topic is "protecting human rights." But to be honest, their sole purpose is really a matter of career.</p>
<p>Now let's study why barristers are so prosperous.</p>
<p>The first reason is because divorces are very prevalent in Shanghai. But in this drama of divorce, a barrister must be used. Later, the number of divorce cases increased day by day, leaving barristers unable to cope, so the number of barristers increased.</p>
<p>There are many rich people in Shanghai. As soon as an old man closes his eyes, several sons will start arguing about dividing the inheritance. If the division is not equal, they will have to consult a barrister. This is another reason.</p>
<p>There are many people in Shanghai who like to show off. Once they have some money, they want to hire a barrister as their year-round legal advisor. Some people even hire several. So the more people who like to show off, the more barristers are needed. This is also a reason.</p>
<p>Also, it's relatively easy to become a barrister. There is evidence to prove this. The number of students in our school who study science is always less than the number of those who study law. And they all attend classes after 5:00 PM. During the day, they can find other jobs. Their professors sometimes don't come to teach because they are all barristers and have extensive social connections. If friends invite them to dinner, they can't go to school. But it's very convenient for the students because they can also go home earlier. This is also a reason.</p>
<p>The above four reasons were told to me by a classmate who is a small-time lawyer. His father is a barrister, and his family wants two generations to be lawyers. I don't think the reason he told me would be wrong. He also said: "We most welcome inheritance division business. If we do it once, we don't have to worry even if no one walks into the office for three months."</p>
<p>The Bread and Butter Problem</p>
<h3 id="e255">Collecting Paper Ingot Ashes <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Azalea</p>
<p>"Collecting paper ingot ashes! Collecting paper ingot ashes!" We can hear it everywhere, and we can see a special appearance, even more comical than Charlie Chaplin on the screen, even more calm than Blaise Pascal, with a crooked braid that's decades old on his head, plus a Qianlong-era felt hat, a face the color of paper ingot ashes, 14th-century clothes, and a pair of genuine domestically-made straw sandals on his feet, with a bamboo basket hanging from his right shoulder and a dry tobacco pot in his left hand. If you were to ask an archaeology PhD to estimate, it would still be worth studying.</p>
<p>I will now talk about their bread and butter problem. There are a total of eight or nine hundred people who sell paper ingot ashes in Shanghai. They are from Shanyin and Kuaiji, no one else is. They say that this is a specialty of Shanyin. Among these eight or nine hundred people, only one hundred have their own capital. The other eight hundred people collect ashes every day and sell them to the furnace owners. There are more than ten furnace factories in total. The one with the most capital is said to be Mr. Xu of the temple, followed by Mr. Sun at Xuenongdi. The best paper ingot ashes can be used to melt tin for profit. When buying and selling, if the seller is not careful, they will have the goods switched out. Their main occupation is farming. When the fields are busy, they return to their hometown. Once the fields are planted, they come back again. They can not only enjoy the prosperity of Shanghai, but also solve their bread and butter problem.</p>

<h3 id="e260">Replacing Old Cars is Sweet <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Now is the Time to Buy a Car</p>
<p>When the 1932 new car models were launched in the last quarter of last year, manufacturers immediately ordered their new automotive products to advance forward. By the time the auto show opened in January this year, cars of all colors and styles came in droves. This further confirmed the above statement. After the auto show ended, the situation became even more apparent in the following months. All manufacturers unanimously made a decision to use their new automotive products as a vanguard to fiercely attack the situation in 1932.</p>
<p>The mechanical improvements of the 1932 new cars speak for themselves. Engineers are well aware of the advancements in the new car engines. However, most car drivers are not comparable to engineers. They express their appreciation for the new cars, but they only know what the manufacturers say, namely, that the new cars are cheaper than the previous ones.</p>
<p>Potential buyers of new cars are told that the new 1932 cars are invariably superior to their predecessors. Therefore, they all want to buy them like crazy and judge for themselves. As a result, some of them purchased them and were overjoyed. Customers all say that the new 1932 cars are of exquisite quality and fair price, a great improvement over previous products. What customers are saying now is what the manufacturers promoted at the beginning of this year. What people are talking about is not the cars they want to sell, but the new cars they want to buy.</p>
<p>In addition to the basic value of the new cars, there are various improvements, such as comfort of riding and safety and convenience of driving. Improvements in the chassis, engine, and body are often unknown to non-mechanical experts, but they can increase the serviceability and longevity of the car. Various improvements can also increase the pleasure of use. The current prices of these innovative cars are still being considered by the general public. First, the price is lower than that of cars in previous years. Second, the current low price cannot remain unchanged for long. According to the opinions of the heads of various manufacturers, the price of new cars has to increase.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the price of cars has been reduced and increased. There is a prevailing opinion in the market that the price reduction of cars has reached its lowest limit. Therefore, according to the heads of various manufacturers, the only change in car prices in the future will be an increase. In addition, the US federal government will soon impose taxes on cars, which will automatically increase the cost of goods for dealers.</p>
<p>Therefore, some say that the best time to buy a car is now. In addition, it goes without saying that buyers can spend all their money to buy a new car. Once the idea of buying a new car arises, the problem of disposing of the old car will inevitably follow. Many people believe that it is wise to keep their existing car for another year. This view is correct for some people, but not entirely. Car owners often have the experience that a car is uneconomical to use at a certain period in its life. As it gets older, the cost of maintenance will inevitably increase day by day. Frequent repairs and maintenance will cost more than a new car.</p>
<p>Therefore, owners of old cars cannot ignore this problem. They must make a comprehensive calculation to determine whether it is more economical to maintain a car with many ailments or to buy a healthy and strong new car. The issue of safety must also be considered. Many old cars are a clear danger to the people in the car and to drivers on the road. If one can think about the occurrence of danger, then one should not overthink the concept of economic savings.</p>
<p>Anyone who has not bought a car or who always buys cars of similar prices may not know the prices of various cars this year. Car buyers can spend all their money to buy a new car. If one wants to buy a car, but dislikes its high price, one may wish to choose a car with a slightly higher or lower price within the same category. Car buyers can buy a small Austin for 330 yuan, or a Duesenberg luxurious car for 13,710 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the two types of cars with the above-mentioned disparate prices, it is not easy to classify the various vehicles in between by value. Some cars may have very low prices in one category, but they are very expensive when viewed in another category. Therefore, it is impossible to establish a clear boundary between various cars. It is very clear. However, generally speaking, the thirty brands of cars manufactured in the United States can be divided into several types: low-priced, low-mid-priced, mid-priced, mid-high-priced, and high-priced.</p>
<p>Except for a few types of cars, the price of low-priced cars is generally around 700 yuan, such as the four-cylinder Austin, the six-cylinder Chevrolet produced by General Motors, the four-cylinder and eight-cylinder Ford, the four-cylinder Plymouth, and the six-cylinder Willys Overland. The price of the small Austin is generally from 330 to 550 US dollars. The price of the Chevrolet has recently been reduced, ranging from 445 to 625 yuan. The new four-cylinder Ford starts from 410 yuan to 600 yuan. The V8 model increases by 50 yuan for each model, ranging from 460 yuan to 650 yuan. The 1932 Chrysler Plymouth is priced from 495 yuan to 785 yuan for the convertible sedan. The Willys Overland "Six" new car is priced from 415 yuan to 665 yuan. Cars priced from 700 yuan to 1,000 yuan are mostly listed in the low-mid-priced category. Some are less than 700 yuan, and some are slightly more than 1,000 yuan, but most are between 700 and 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Benefits. If the existing short-distance light rail train is properly streamlined, the total horsepower required to travel at a speed of 75 to 80 miles per hour can be reduced by more than half.</p>
<p>It is expected that the results of these experiments will lead to revolutionary high-speed train designs. The application of streamlining to trains may not be as extensive as its application to airplanes, but considering the past achievements, it is not difficult to imagine its future development in this area.</p>
<p>Looking back to 1910, when humans began to explore the sky, streamlining was first tested in the air. The resistance encountered was entirely air resistance, and the original box-like airplane was deemed unsuitable and changed to a streamlined shape.</p>
<p>Dr. Ames, chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in the United States, once said that full streamlining can reduce the resistance of an airplane by two-thirds. Then, any three-engine large airplane on the US air routes, if properly modified, can reduce two engines and still maintain the same speed as it currently has.</p>
<p>Observing the recent performance of the British Royal Air Force, it can be seen that today's aircraft manufacturers attach great importance to streamlining. In the research to strive for more complete streamlining, many new airplane styles that reduce wind resistance have been obtained. After this, there is still ample room for streamlining to develop in aviation.</p>
<h3 id="e261">French Minister Weildon and his 1932 Citroen six-cylinder car pictured at the French Consulate in this port <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<h3 id="e262">Streamlining of Transportation Vehicles (Continued) Left <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>However, streamlining is not limited to automobiles. Streamlining is also necessary for trains. The results of experiments by French person M. Charles Maurpin determined that air resistance is at least one-third of the total resistance experienced by trains. Therefore, if French trains are properly modified according to the principles of streamlining, the amount of coal consumed each year can be reduced by one million tons.</p>
<p>Several trains in continental Europe have already been somewhat streamlined. One is the "Golden Arrow" of northern France. Its shape is as strange as its name. The carriages are tightly connected, with a shiny aluminum conical tail trailing behind. The German "Schubert Liner" train looks like a giant fish. It moves by means of a propeller installed at the rear. Recently, it set a new speed record of 143 miles per hour. Even in the United States, rounded locomotives with chimneys and headlights hidden inside can be seen.</p>
<p>The Westinghouse Research Experiment Institute in the United States is currently testing the effect of streamlining on special express trains and light rail trains. Research director Dr. Theodore Strong is convinced that streamlining express trains can reduce wind resistance by two-thirds and the total resistance experienced by the body by one-half. Tie also feels that streamlining is not very important for large, slow trains, but it is very important for light rail trains. Currently, the landing gear and protruding parts of airplanes can increase air resistance by 50% or more. If the engine is not fundamentally modified and the speed of the airplane is to be greatly increased, then those parts must be removed or built into the body.</p>
<p>Streamlining in navigation, like in land transportation and aviation, is also beginning to make rapid progress. The main reason why steamboats can reach speeds close to 100 miles per hour is the reform of the hull style. Old-fashioned V-shaped steamboats drained a lot of water, which caused great resistance. Since being changed to a flat seaplane style, its speed has increased threefold.</p>
<p>Partial streamlining has been successfully applied to several huge outer wheel steamships. New-style boats with aircraft propellers will soon be traveling in German rivers. This type of boat pays special attention to air resistance. The shape, which has been streamlined by engineers to prepare it for aerial use, has achieved effective streamlining when used for low-speed travel on water. However, when applying high speeds, the resistance situation is very different. A boat traveling at 100 miles per hour experiences the same resistance as an airplane traveling at 1,300 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Streamlining has almost become a matter of common concern in the engineering world today. Streamlining has a wide range of uses, and its application to ordinary cars seems to be the most revolutionary. If our cars are properly shaped, they can travel twice as far per gallon of gasoline. If this is indeed possible, why hasn't it been done before?</p>
<p>The reason seems to be that since aircraft became popular, the speed of transportation vehicles has greatly increased, making it necessary to consider air resistance. Also, most car manufacturers were afraid that the unusual style of streamlined bodies would not be popular at the time, so they did not dare to make changes.</p>
<p>Some say that streamlining cannot be widely applied today because the slender streamlined shape wastes the internal space of the car and makes parking more difficult. At the same time, a famous engineer predicts that streamlined cars will be popular throughout the United States in the next few years, and points to the achievements Germany has made as the basis for his prediction.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Overview of the Features of the 1932 New Car Yu <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>The 1932 new car has already been launched. With the old replacing the new, all car dealers are doing their best to promote it, filling the market with new cars to replace the old ones that have been used up. Car manufacturers are working even harder to promote it, competing to describe the various advantages and improvements of their new cars, removing the old and bringing forth the new, constantly striving for perfection. Compared with the previous 1931 model, there are many improvements and reforms. However, to describe the main points, it does not go beyond the following four items: (1) extra smooth and quiet operation, (2) reduced noise from the body and moving parts, (3) more refined body and chassis construction, and a more comfortable driving experience, (4) increased speed and more economical use, and a better appearance. Therefore, the 1932 new car, apart from the minor improvements in style and appearance, its mechanical structure has improved, namely, its excellent operation and power transmission.</p>
<p>The progress of automotive machinery is developing with new wonders every day, and the greatest recent progress is the free clutch. Its impact on car manufacturing is like that of the automatic engine and four-wheel braking system in the past. Almost all new cars have adopted this free clutch device. In addition, several cars will be equipped with automatic couplings, which have the function of a free clutch. As for the transmission of power, various cars have shown great progress in this structure. The gear shifting is easy and smooth everywhere, and the convenience is incomparable to the four-speed control device that was called the greatest progress a few years ago.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a car manufacturer created a small car that placed the engine on two rubber pillars, calling it "floating power." The manufacturer of this small car is said to be modifying large cars in its own way. However, if the construction method of this new invention is not adopted in the 1932 new car, it will soon be given deep consideration and used in cars. The above are all important points. Other important details cannot be described at this time. All the new cars this year have been referenced. Now, let me briefly list their names, such as vacuum electrical spark management, vacuum pump, used to drive the windshield wiper, automatic engine, fuel cooling device, and double valve construction, with four valves for each cylinder. This greatly increases the speed and power, while the size of the engine remains the same and does not increase.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, in terms of engine manufacturing, hard heat-resistant alloys are used in the cylinder walls and valve seats. Aluminum pistons are widely used. The number of lead-containing engines is increasing, so all-aluminum cars will soon be realized. The 1932 new car uses a lot of rubber in its manufacturing, because it can maintain stability and facilitate the operation of the body. The noise problem of cars has always been a problem that car manufacturers have been eager to solve. The 1932 car has made great progress in reducing noise. All kinds of noises from the engine, chassis, and body have been reduced to the greatest extent. The gear meshing is smooth and quiet. All parts of the power transmission are calibrated, so the impact noise is greatly reduced. The noise at the rear of the engine is almost completely eliminated, and the noise at the front is also reduced by special devices.</p>
<p>The construction of the body is also special, which can avoid all crushing noises. The tenon joints are all made by local forging, which is different from the use of screws in the past. Others use rubber as a filling material to avoid vibration and noise when the body is connected. In addition, car manufacturers have used a driving management feature to ensure the smooth and comfortable driving. This was invented by a manufacturer, and three other manufacturers followed suit. Passengers who have this manager installed</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Can exert the comfort they want. On various different roads, they can increase or decrease the oil pressure in the water shock absorber to achieve a smooth ride.</p>
<p>The physical strength of the chassis is as greatly improved as the body. Either its size is increased, or its style and construction are changed. Every place can make the driver feel comfortable and safe. When it comes to appearance, the 1932 new car has the most reforms. Its overall shape is low, flat and streamlined, so the radiator is also designed in a low shape to make it look forward and beautiful. The windshield is also slightly tilted forward, forming a beautiful curve that is very symmetrical up and down. The sun visor has been replaced by a curtain that can be adjusted at any time. This is very convenient for the driver, because it can block the sunlight coming from the front at any time, and can also block the light coming from the side, making the forward view clearer. Moreover, removing the sun visor not only improves the appearance, but also makes the action faster, because it can reduce the pressure resistance of the wind. As for the symmetry and beauty of the front and rear shapes of the new car, there is no need to repeat them.</p>
<p>The internal form and beauty of the new car are all excellent, but one thing can be stated is that the driving buttons used on the new car are all installed directly in front of the driver. In this way, the driver can have the wonderful feeling of getting started quickly and with ease when looking forward. Moreover, the space on the right is freed up. This is a safety feature of the 1932 new car.</p>
<h3 id="e264">News Ford Motor's Recent Reforms Ze <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>The 1932 Ford car has only slight changes in its appearance in the water tank. Also, the body is lowered like a scholar because the front and rear axles are slightly bent downward. No other innovations have been seen.</p>
<p>As for the content of the Ford car, there are many reforms. The most important of these is the location of the gasoline tank, which has been moved from the front of the car to the rear. The reason why the gasoline tank is placed in the front of the car is that it is close to the engine, which poses a fire hazard. Except for very small cars, which cannot be moved, almost no cars have the gasoline tank placed in the front. Now that Ford cars have moved the gasoline tank to the rear of the car, the contents of Ford cars are becoming more and more similar to ordinary cars. As for the position of the gasoline tank being moved to the rear, a gasoline pump is added to draw gasoline into the carburetor.</p>
<p>The steering wheel of the new car is made of black copper bone elm skin. In the center of the wheel, there is a control for the front headlights. A lock is also added to the steering gear to make the car parked on the road safer.</p>
<p>The window wiping machine on the front window of the new car is also very novel. The machine uses the engine's intake function to move. The whole machine is hidden inside the roof, and even the steam pipe is hidden and cannot be seen. Only the switch and the wiper blade are exposed.</p>
<p>The lubrication system of the engine has been improved, that is, an oil pump is added to the original splashing method to supply oil, so that the circulation of the engine oil is more active.</p>
<p>The diameter of the wheels is slightly shortened, but the size of the tires is slightly increased, with measurements of 5.25×18 inches.</p>
<p>The length of the body has increased by two and a half inches. Therefore, the doors of the two-door sedan are very wide. Passengers who want to enter the rear seats in the car do not need to press down the back of the front seat, so entering and exiting is very convenient.</p>
<p>The contents of the transmission have also been slightly reformed. The gears in the second gear are constantly meshing, and the speed change is very simple. It is also stable and noise-free when used. The contents of the Ford engine are completely unchanged except for the addition of one gasoline and one oil pump each. The battery in the electrical group has a capacity of eighty amperes.</p>
<p>There are two types of Ford cars manufactured in the UK. One is the small Ford car with eight horsepower, and the other is the large Ford car. The latter is divided into two types: high power and low power. Except for the different horsepower of the engines, all parts of the chassis are completely the same. The selling price in the UK is £180 for the two-door sedan and £225 for the four-door sedan. If you buy a small horsepower car, you have to add another £5.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned high-power engine has an actual horsepower of 24 horsepower, and the low-power engine has 14 horsepower. The former generates 48 horsepower at a speed of 2,400 revolutions per minute, and the latter can get 41 horsepower at 3,000 revolutions per minute.</p>
<p>As for the low-horsepower engine, it saves more gasoline. If the current gasoline tank can hold 11 gallons of gasoline, it can travel 270 miles. However, the high-horsepower car can only travel 240 miles.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Features of Commer Trucks Explained <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Commer Commercial Motor Car Company. One of the earliest established among the major British truck manufacturers. Its products have been popular all over the world for more than twenty-five years. Commer trucks' four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines are strong and beautiful, with no worry of vibration. They are used for heavy loads and long distances, and are extremely economical and cost-effective. They are not only agile and stable. As for the entire chassis, it is especially praised by engineers and transportation companies. The silent three-speed gearbox is a feature of commercial vehicles that originated with Commer, and has been proven by the "fG.Q" and "Jnvader" models. This is especially effective for difficult jobs. Only with this equipment can a proper speed be maintained, and less force is applied to the engine. Another important feature is that Commer trucks use a special superior worm gear as standard equipment, which is light, has no vibration, and allows the driver to control the vehicle freely and easily in crowded areas. The design of the new Commer truck</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>and construction are perfectly suited to modern automotive transport and all the needs of mechanical power ratio. There are two styles on display: the famous "Raider" and "Gentaur". The Raider has the most complete advantages of any one-and-a-half-ton truck in the same price range. The wheelbase is ten feet six inches. If equipped with a railing body, it is especially suitable for loading long and heavy goods. The engine is a side-valve type, with six cylinders and a Royal Automobile Club rated horsepower of 22.6. The clutch and gearbox are specially rolled for heavy work. The cooling system has a specially enlarged capacity, and the pressure car has a magnificent effect and is completely sealed and can be adjusted separately. The driving action is extremely convenient and extremely reliable.</p>
<p>The Gentaur is a two-ton truck with a smaller wheelbase than usual, but a larger body position. It is not only spacious for loading heavy goods, but also very convenient to operate in narrow places. The chassis is specially constructed and extremely strong. The crossbars are especially sturdy, so no matter how heavy the load or how poor the road conditions, it can easily handle it without any bending. In short, the Gentaur is a real heavy-duty truck that can provide full utilization for all businesses with its speed, reliability, and cost-effective service. The Gentaur engine is a six-cylinder side-valve type with a Royal Automobile Club rated horsepower of 22.6. The wheelbase is 135 inches. The rear axle is a special superior floating type, and the traffic jam automatically increases power, making the effect even more magnificent. The clutch and gearbox are a single dry plate type, completely enclosed in the flywheel, requiring no lubrication and no attention</p>

<h3 id="e267">Public Concession Recent Automobile Statistics Praised <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Ford Ranks First with the Most</p>
<p>The automobile registration statistics of the French Concession in Shanghai have been recorded in this publication. Here are the recent statistics of automobile registration in the Public Concession. From January 1, 1932 to March 31, the number of automobile registrations in the first quarter of this year was 6,038 passenger cars, 1,933 trucks, and 782 motorcycles. There were a total of 173 brands of passenger cars, but the automobiles used by the foreign troops stationed in Shanghai are not included, and the number is also several hundred. Among the cars, the largest number is still Buick and Ford. Ford is the champion, with a number of 642. Buick is 7 less than Ford, with a total of 635, ranking second.</p>
<p>In addition to Ford and Buick, the third is Chevrolet, with a total of 385. The fourth is Austin, with 372. The others with more than 300 are Studebaker, ranking fifth, with 339. Felix the Cat ranks sixth, with 334. Morris Cowley ranks seventh, with 317.</p>
<p>There are four types with more than 200. Dodge ranks eighth with 260. Nash ranks ninth with 260. Essex ranks tenth with 206. Willys-Overland Whippet ranks eleventh with 201. Those exceeding 100 include Morris Oxford with 182, Citroen with 168, Chrysler with 126, Hupmobile with 119, and Renault with 102. Judging from the above numbers, it is evident that Austin, Studebaker, and Standard are progressing very rapidly. Plymouth also shows signs of improvement. This kind of increase is quite similar to the situation in the United States. This is probably due to the progress of "floating power."</p>

<h3 id="e268">Advantages of Dodge Four-Cylinder Cars <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Floating Power and Free Wheeling</p>
<p>The revival of Dodge four-cylinder cars is truly an important page in automotive history. Considering that automobile manufacturers are currently competing fiercely to be the leader, and want to use the increase in the number of engine cylinders to solve the problem of car vibration, then the revival of this type of four-cylinder car is especially valuable and worthy of praise. Four-cylinder cars have always been known for their simplicity and economy. Now, in addition to restoring its original characteristics, the Dodge four-cylinder car also has natural floating power. Because of this advantage, not only are all the shaking and vibrations of the frame and body completely eliminated, but also its full mechanical power, magnificent effect, comfortable appearance, and easy and free operation are all outstanding and unmatched.</p>
<p>In addition to natural floating power, free wheeling is another important feature of the new Dodge four-cylinder car. The reason why the new Dodge four-cylinder car is so easy to operate and has the advantage of "effortless management" is that it has a special superior power transmission device, silent gears, silent second gear, and free wheeling. The sedan-shaped double-drop frame, matched with a steel-welded unibody, complement each other and are even more beautiful. The center of gravity of the car is thus lowered, while the road clearance and interior position are not damaged at all. Furthermore, the use of a new driving wheel and a steering wheel shock absorber placed on the front spring to the left or right of the driver, so that road bumps will not be transmitted to the steering wheel, making it more comfortable to be in the car. As for high-speed driving, no matter how sharp the turn, it is still smooth and comfortable, with no danger of tilting or hard wheel turning. The reason why the new Dodge four-cylinder car is so easy to drive and so comfortable to ride is due to the above advantages.</p>
