<p>流光如駛。轉瞬之間。中華民國二十一年僅有今日一日矣。試回顧過去一年之中。細審我國政治上之進步如何。經濟上之進步如何。國民活力之增加者幾何。辨認愈深。尤不禁悲從中來。感奮愈切。　　溯自前年九一八事變以還。我國雖處處居於劣敗地位。不戰而失瀋陽吉林。敵兵突擊。即棄錦州。中國雖土地廣博。其能經幾次宰割耶。所聊堪自慰者。即瀋變而後。國民略有向上之動機。政府亦具與民更始之决意。黨國先輩。且力倡「精神圑結。共赴國難。」前此之不調和處。乃因大難頭而盡行消去。從此可以上下同心。舉國一致以共赴國難。孰知一二八事變陡起於肘腋之間。全國所依爲財政及產業重心之上海。竟遭砲擊。首都南京亦僅得免。抗戰達三十有二日。就憂鬰方面觀察。閘北繁盛之區。盡化焦士。吳淞形　之地。突變瓦礫塲。僅以有形之物質損失。合淞滬一带計之。當在十萬萬圓以上。而精神的損失。人命之代價。與夫東南半壁。凡工商各業間接虧耗。尙不在内。東北之失陷。誠爲我國民永世不忘之奇恥。而淞滬喋血。尤係我民族百年尤新之深恨。但就另一方面觀察。我國雖遭受空前未有之困難。值百業凋零農村極度困疲之际。尙能勉强支持。僅以一隅之師。當傾國之宼。　戰月餘。一般國民。奮其勤苦耐勞之精神。協助政府。外禦强敵。内抑禍亂。於此短時期中。固未能克盡全功。而民族精神。實已充分表現。旣明自力復與之道。五千年積習已深之古國。焉能計其一日之功。矧强敵當前。國難正亟。而地方猶欠清理耶。</p>
<p>當今之世。高呌國難者。固非僅我國爲然也。以北美合衆國之富。無論天產人工。自歐洲大戰而後。堪稱世界獨步。然自經濟恐慌發生以來。遂日漸衰。一九三一年六月胡佛總統宣佈賠欵戰債延期支付。滿以爲世界經濟。將有轉機矣。無乃迄今一年有半。世界經濟。旣未變好。合衆國情形。反而恐慌加甚。工業製造品。堆積如山。小麥棉花。亦均跌至生產費用所需之最低價值以下。商品叢　。無法消售。而失業者增加（至一千萬以上。）餓莩載道。組織緊密。富有强悍精神之德意志。因壓迫重重。無論政治上經濟上之情實。皆處於絕頂困難之中。布魯寗内閣。即以緊急命令維繫其國民經濟之圓滑週轉。巴本上台。幾爲絕對專制。雖曾解散議會。亦不能征取多數議席。勝過希脫拉黨之法西斯；運動。及至施萊赫將軍組閣。以内閣總理而兼國防。乃純爲軍人政治。矣然而德國當前之經濟因難。豈軍事的强力所能解决。五百九十餘萬失業工人。（據工會調查·則謂完全失業者·占二千萬零七十五萬工人中百分之四十七·）此種景象。豈輕於戰爭也哉。法國在歐洲各國中。其經濟情形。最爲穩定。究其實際。市面繁榮到達頂點時期較各國爲後。故其衰落也亦遲。且曾收受大量賠欵。去年以來。雖盡量增築關稅壁壘。輸入貿易因此减低。而輸出貿易。較之去年亦縮减百分之三十以上。失業工人陡增至三十四萬。國庫支出。則較一九二六年時膨脹百分之五十。故藏金豐富居世界第二位之法闌西。其經濟的國難。固仍繼續未已也。英國原爲資本主義各國之領袖。去年秋季以來。即抛棄其金本制。甘心讓其金融王座。以通貨膨脹政策。維持瀕於衰落之經濟。憲政先進國家。竟脫離憲政常道而組織舉國協力一致内閣。應付其非常（國難。）二百九十二萬之失業者。仍屬無法就業。彼日本自以爲軍刀可以征服一切。武力戰勝。即可消彌當前之因頓。殊不知軍費增加。乃爲恢復市面之惟一阻碍。設我中國不肯屈服。則日本之所謂國難永無消解之期。</p>
<p>環顧今日之世界。小國無論矣。皆日向破產程途中崩潰。即所謂六大國者。莫不處於危機四伏之中。皆奮其全力。或以本國爲基本。如英帝國之經濟聯盟。或以開拓領土爲職志。如日本之侵略我國。其舉國若狂共赴國難則一也。</p>
<p>試返觀我國。自九一八迄一二八事變期間。國人處於强敵暴力壓迫之下。尙能勉力自助。乘時奮起。頓有中國復與之新氣象。曾幾何時。眼前之危機仍舊。東北三省。陷於敵手。滬戰創痕尙平服。敵方軍隊。則耀武揚威於我國境内。而一般人民經一度鬆弛。（農村略見豐收工商且困於城市）·當前危機。乃熟視若無觀。酣歌曼舞醉死夢生。惟追尋片刻之歡娛快樂。坐待敵人之自斃。漠視東北之淪亡。於民族國家前途。初無所顧惜。危險當前亦不知警惕。更有甚者。戕賊個人之不足。而乃嫁禍地方。災及人民。授敵人以口實騰笑友邦。遺羞當世。陷國家於危亡。是故愛我者袖手旁觀。怒我者落井下石仇我者且操刀相割矣。</p>
<p>自國聯調查團報告晝發表。以至國聯行政院開會此三個月時期中。統觀我國境内。韓劉交閧。幸得平息。而四川二劉爭鬭竟至水陸空三軍并用。無辜川民。乃須忍受形同敵國之殘酷災禍。川戰未已復加以黔軍猶王之爭。瘠苦如貴州尚不免屢遭兵　忠實於所事之勤苦農人。用盡勞力。亦難得一時之安枕。長江下游一带。去年遭受水患。室如　罄。今春突聞滬戰。驚悸欲絕。秋季豐收。又復穀賤成災。一命如絲。不絕如縷。所幸頼維持者。厥爲我國民堅忍卓絕。耐苦茹辛之歷史美德以撑此瀕於破產之危局。是故敵國方面百計欺凌。萬端笑駡。甚至謂我國爲無組織之國家。其意在從根底暗示列强。「中國旣未形成近代國家。則可任人取予。」且又嚴整軍備。國聯大會期中。又借換防之名。調熊本第六師團前往錦義一带。準備乘時侵襲熱河。掠　榆關而主持和平之國際聯盟。匪特受英法兩大國之影響僅止於保持歐洲之均勢。今且一意曲就日本。實行延宕靜觀。坐令東亞和平。碎於日本軍國主義鐵蹄之下。</p>
<p>東方市塲自今失却均衡。戰爭禍根。於是愈種愈深。好戰之日本軍閥且揮其軍刀。指責和平。竟欲與我國實施清算。</p>
<p>我國處此險惡環境中。復遇强橫無比之頑敵。必須及時奮起爭鬭。血肉相摶。眉尾相結。與敵人爭取最後之勝利。我雖實力薄弱。苟盡力與日本相撲。最後勝利。必歸「悲者。」當此年終之日。願國人努力自勉。『以前種種譬如昨日死。以後種種譬如今日生！。』</p>

<p>㈠敎育爲什麽辦不好？種田人何以反沒有飯吃？</p>
<p>丨高勉之君來信丨</p>
<p>我這裏有兩個問題，其一，敎育問題：余自十七歲之翌年努力鄉敎以來，已將九載，其始之五年，上受土劣（學委）之把持，下受羣小之包圍，雖得農友之信仰，終因異地人而辭職。十八年之夏，慕曉莊學校之名，約二三同志，自費赴寗參觀一月有餘。同時有本縣敎育界亦組織參觀圑前往，未聞有雙字之報告他。而余則偕同志奔走四鄉，覓定校址而創設本校焉。二年以來，上無行政當局之協助，下受同業（敎育非職業）之妒忌，進展因難已極！余今欲問：㈠把持敎育之土劣何以不能打倒？㈡官費參。觀的何以沒有報告？有志參觀的何以得不到官費？㈢行政當局何以口裏重視鄉村敎育，而實際不予以協助？㈣同業何以要妒忌而不肯合作？㈤努力鄉村敎育是否是書獃子，而人家應否以書獃子目之？其二，農村問題：本校附近之農村社會，人民勤儉，烟賭不知。去年因天時關係，田稻短收不少，就拿柴來說，今年的農友們，也感到沒柴燒的苦處了。因此，今年農民要吃十六元一石的米；本地出產，除了米外，在春夏之交，尙有蠶繭和豆麥之類的副產品，不料今年的荳麥，幾乎賤得沒有人要，蠶繭只有一角洋錢一片。這已經使農友們够受的了，豈知又有什麽×××的；軍隊開到農村裏來，住上二個多月，雖無重大損失，然供養之費，已經很爲難的了！唉！不幸的農民，那裏想得到目前要吃這許多苦哩，辛苦了一年，田稻是熟了，每畝平均有五斛吧，那知又是空歡喜，米價只值六元了啊！請看他們的出欵：㈠牛欵㈡米欵㈢漕糧㈣畝捐㈤租米㈥賬欵！草把米欵來計算罷：十六元加利要三石糙米還一石白米哪！所以，這裏有幾個問題，是農友們問我而我不能解答的，在此一併提出，請加解答：種田的何以反沒飯吃？㈡米麥豆絲等農產品何以如此賤？㈢店裏的東西何以這麽貴？㈣捐稅何以這麽大？㈤我們要軍隊有什麽用？</p>
<p>···記者按：高君所問幾點，確都是眼前很重要的問題，記者認爲有公開討論價值，特在此提請讀者諸君來共同討論。</p>
<p>㈡目前大家所要說的是什麽話？</p>
<p>丨張從龍君來信丨</p>
<p>我的意見：申報上的讀者顧問，太覺乏味了，狠好的一個有益的敎師，牠是要去指使一些迷路者的，而徒然供給一般所謂失業者，喊一些無謂的口號，不是說社會環境不良，就是說自己要做工都辦不到，舞一下筆桿子，發發牢騒。要曉得做工要有三種條件：第一，須問問你自己可有做工的技能，廠裏不是養老院，要這些外行。第二，自己可能吃苦？做工要用氣力的，第三，方能說社會不良，政府無能，爲何不開幾個冩字工廠，養活我們？我不信有了技能又能吃苦的工人，會得找不到飯吃而餓死。還有一種女太太們，或者是女才子的變相，開口說婚姻不良，討些補救方法，閉口說對方不好，徵求些自由出路，或者造個謠言，出出風頭。我想在這個世界，别說是女性受了些丈夫的壓迫，舉目一望，環球六大洲，大有大的壓迫，小有小的壓迫，誰不在壓迫之下生活着。我向來不說空泛話的，今天也得了傳染病了。於討論科學智識的通信，或者想辦一種事業徵求各界合作的文字，那麽或者能引起若干人的興趣吧。</p>
<p>覆；接讀來信，我們覺得足下的思想，實在矛盾得可以。你旣然知道「環球」羣衆，誰都「在壓迫之下生活着「，何以又說「一般」「失業者」的「口號」都是些「無謂」的「牢騒」？足下之意，是否呌許多被壓迫者應該服從「壓迫」到底·不應該有一些反抗？目前社會的「不良」，凡是平日稍稍留心觀察社會的，都會知道，而你還說這一般的呼號是在「發牢騒」那末要怎樣的呼號，才算「有謂」呢？才不是「發牢騒」呢？我們也知道，做工要有相當「技能」，要能「吃苦」，可是目前的問題，是否是「技能」與「吃苦」的問題？大家可以看見有多少有「技能」而又能「吃苦」的人，都不免於「失業」·不免於「餓死」，這究竟是誰的不好？水災，旱災，兵災，匪災，以及其他一切的「壓迫」，都是「天老爺」的「恩賜」呢？還是「人謀之不臧」？成羣的失業羣衆，他們都是爲沒有「技能」和不能「吃苦」而失業的嗎？譬如足下現在想去辦一點「事業」，單靠你的「技能」和能「吃苦」，事業是否就能發達？有無其他種種障礙，會使你事業終歸失敗？這種種擺在眼前的嚴重問題，大家正忙着討論改革，而足下還輕輕以「牢騒」兩字抺倒之，眞使我們「莫明其妙」了：至於婚姻問題，雖已經過許多人的奮鬥，直至今日，也還是不能普遍獲得「自由」事實亦很明顯，足下却以爲在這種不自由的壓迫之下的呼聲，目的是在「出出風頭」，理論之幼稚，同樣的使人可笑。總之，我們也知道現在應該從事所謂「建設」，應該多研究自然科學，然而社會如此，非先有一番變革，一切何從談起：我們毫無成見，只知跟着大家走，大家來信是說什麽，我們就給他發表什麽，足下要我們多發表些關於研究「科學」「事業」的函件，我們未嘗不願，其如來信都是痛苦的「口號」與「牢騒」何？</p>

<p>祇以九人作戰寡不敵衆</p>
<p>「蘭開夏三比二勝」</p>
<p>昨日曁南對蘭開夏在在逸園作史高塔杯複賽、以已往實力言、曁南雖失陳鎭和羅海光二將、猶不難擊敗蘭開夏而取得决赛權、安知幸運不佳、禍不單行、上塲念五分鐘、曁南卽傷徐亞輝及鍾冠明二大將、以後僅以九人作戰、雖猶努力作戰、攻入兩球、卒以寡不敵衆、遭二比三之慘敗、於是史高塔杯、曁南淘汰、讓碧眼黄毛爭奪天下矣、兩隊陣線如下、</p>
<p>蘭開夏</p>
<p>希　爾　薩萊福　　　　　　麥克獨惠　　　　賴恩士　　馬　生　　　　　召　貝　勞　頓　　　　　　披　脫　　　　　巴恩斯　　　　　　　　　　馬列斯　開　芝　　曁南隊</p>
<p>梁樹棠　劉祖侃　　　　　　顧尙　　　　　　鍾冠明　　徐　亨　　　　　莊世鴻　徐亞輝　　　　　　江善敬　　　　　陳鎭祥　　　　　　　　　　謝全和　梅洪寶　　丘八連中兩球　昨戰曁南陣線中引人注目者、卽爲原任守門謝全和改任右前鋒、由蜚聲香港廣州之徐亨擔任守門、但徐之技術、未見特殊表演、交綏之下、雙方爲奪標心切、競爭殊烈、曁南因江善敬與守門之誤會、被丘八中鋒勞頓攻入一球、離開賽約五分鐘耳、同時鍾冠明卽告受傷離塲、混戰角逐、曁南幾度進攻、均不見效、在二十分鐘時、蘭開夏巴恩士又中一球、成二與零之比、</p>
<p>曁南還敬一只　曁南連失兩球、怒氣冲天、全軍奮發、大舉反攻、未及五分鐘、江善敬後方送出遠球、梅洪寶帶前進攻、通過兩關、至相當地點、短交與陳鎭祥、陳乘機射門、一舉成功、乃還敬一球、劇戰聲中、莊此鴻忽亦受傷、幸卽痊愈、不料在二十五分鐘時、徐亞輝復告重傷離塲、以後之曁南、祇九人作戰、實力大受影響、　　劉祖侃造和局　上半時過去後、稍事休息、曁南一鼓作氣、殊見驍勇、前鋒雖祇三人、但個個威風凛凛、不可一世、相戰不六分鐘、邊將劉祖侃邊陲入寇、所向披靡、進至門角、横掃一脚、球勢猛急、飛入門角、建立奇功、姿勢殊美、曁南遂成二比二之和局、死裏逃生、大有後來居上之勢、</p>
<p>二比三遭慘敗　曁南自造成二比二後、精神爲之一振、前鋒三小時、躍躍欲試、時探敵壘、無如接應乏人、呼應無方、每有力不從心之慨、蘭開夏猛撲不已、開芝屢逞妙技、周旋又約十分鐘許、曁南球門、忽受包圍、四面夾攻、江善敬顧尙勷、招架不暇、徐亨顧此失彼、於是智者千慮、必有一失、久而久之、卒被蘭開夏右内鋒巴恩士攻入一球、嗣後曁南九人位置、時有調動、冀作背城借一、無如寡不敵衆、力不從心、不得不以二比三慘敗矣、</p>

<p>二十六比二十五丨兩江勝最後罰球</p>
<p>林寳華鄭兆佳等丨網球表演頗出色</p>
<p>今日綱球繼續表演丨今日競走丨足球比賽</p>
<p>杭州新浙江建設運動會、邀請上海男女球隊表演、昨日第一日、上午女子籃球、兩江以二十六比二十五勝東南一分、下午綱球表演、由林寳華鄭兆佳等出塲、今日上午、繼續網球表演、下午中華競走隊、表演環城競走、尙有足球比賽、上海華聯隊、對杭聯會隊、下午三時起、其况甚盛、　　兩江勝東南</p>
<p>丨形勢始終緊張難分軒輊</p>
<p>丨最後一罰球兩江得勝利</p>
<p>結果二十六比二十五</p>
<p>新浙江建設運動會、昨日在杭州省立體育塲開幕、第一塲比賽、女子籃球表演、兩江以二十六比二十五勝東南一分、最後三分鐘時、兩隊各得二十五分、臨了一分鐘、兩江楊森罰中一分、才定勝負、東南孫毓秀於完畢前、亦判得一罰球、但球竟離籃而出、遂差一分失敗、爲之惋惜、論實力、論表演、難分姊妹、精彩與緊張、難得遭見、裁判舒鴻、</p>
<p>飛機獻技比賽之前、覓橋中央航空學校學員、駕駛飛機二架、在球塲四週、上下翱翔、忽高忽低、或直上雲霄、或一落而下、翻身顚倒、作種種驚人表演、臨時散放彩色傳單、競相爭得、</p>
<p>廳長開球直至十時半、才由建設廳長曾飬甫、行開球禮、四座觀者、約五六百人、曾廳長向上一抛、裁判之銀笛一呌、兩江東南遂開始爭球、杭市長趙志游亦預早在塲觀戰、</p>
<p>形勢平等兩江東南互相攻守、進退盤旋、楊森發見技術犯規、孫毓秀雙手上抛、東南以一分先開紀錄、潘月英半塲遠射、加上二分、東南聲勢浩大、先得三分、而兩江屢次進攻、陳榮明在籃下投擲、失去可中之機會二次、球進在中線處、陸雪琴鄒善德自相爭球、漁翁得利、球褌下滾後、兩江中將陳榮明截獲直進、陸雪琴趕往阻之、球旣入籃、又宣告犯規、兩江於此連得三分、兩方平等、</p>
<p>兩江佔先東南在此平手局面之下、接連施用遠射戰法、心與願達、失去之機會無數、潘夢中的、兩江以五比三超出、潘月英再造平等、然而陳榮明潘夢接連又中、第一節完畢、兩江以九比五勝四分、</p>
<p>緊張聲中休息二分鐘、東南奮發爭雄、大顯身手、潘月英王慧貞各中一球、頓時恢復九比九、兩江陳榮明又加二分、王慧貞不示弱、十一比十一、十三比十三、兩江見勢緊張、再呌休息、是爲第三項、潘月英罰中、東南以十四比十三、穿出兩江一分、上半時末個一分、楊森在嚴密監視中、投入網内、兩江以十五比十四勝一分、</p>
<p>難解難分檸檬之後、再决雌雄、楊森罰得一分、潘月英之遠投、又是十六比十六、十八比十八、二十比二十、此八分鐘中、可稱遠射時代、雙方以守衛過密、發展甚難、雙方百步穿楊这妙技、全塲驚嘆、相顧失色、第三節完畢、兩江二十二比二十勝二分、</p>
<p>又成平手决勝負之最後八分鐘、全局最精彩之一段、陳英明連得三分、兩江突以二十五比二十、促居有把握之勝勢、然而王慧貞異軍突起、在離籃二十尺之斜角、一舉中的、再接再厲、又入籃下、黄淑華禦之、球旣入綱、黄判犯規、王慧貞爲東南恢復失地五分、二十五比二十五、局勢突轉成平局、離完塲尙有二分鐘、一時空氣緊張、全塲呼喊、</p>
<p>惜哉一分勝負將决於此二分鐘中、各方皆心慌意亂、一無所得、東南不幸、代替陸雪琴入塲之秦瑞英、忽判犯規、楊森罰中、此一分、爲兩江造勝利、然東南於最後之一秒、孫毓秀亦得罰球、奈球不入綱、徒呼負負、二十六比二十五解决勝負、</p>
<p>特殊藝術雙方表演、在天寒氣冷之中、若是表演之佳妙、可稱雙方所未有、兩江前鋒以陳榮明最敏速、翻身籃下、反手一托、美妙難述、楊森受監視、有甚得意、東南王慧貞異星突起、爲全隊生色不少、後衛監視之嚴密、使兩江無從入籃下、亦東南之特殊之色彩、</p>

<h3 id="c142">林寳華鄭兆佳各一 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>丨三比六丨六比四丨</p>
<p>林寳華對鄭兆佳之單打、最受注意、林第一盤以三比六失敗、第二盤六比四奪回、</p>
<p>寳華斷拍開塲林發球、連勝回記、繼續又得二局、三比零先聲奪、第四局小鄭開球塲地雨後尙濕、舗河亦滑、小鄭一記向林反手力射、林一滑坐倒於地、網拍之絃斷其二、鄭請其換、鄧洛普新拍、林謂完畢再換、豈知一連失六局、第一盤六比三、鄭兆佳勝、</p>
<p>兆佳受贊第二盤之第一局、爲林所勝、兆佳又以二比一追出、三比二居先、至此林才得二局、四比三佔前、而以六比四奪回一局林常第笑容、態度殊佳、二人表演、各極其致、林寳華時近時遠、忽輕忽重三球、使觀者孫馬芙而鄭兆佳之抽擊、跳起重壓、兩角準射、其藝不在寳華之下甚遠、靑出於籃勝於籃、咸謂不料有鄭兆佳若是之能、殊出意外</p>
<h3 id="c143">江道章全勝陳乃新 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>

<p>曾養甫試球　兩江東南女子籃球表演賽、原定十時開始、會長趙志游、早於九時前蒞塲、觀兩軍練習、笑容可掬、嗣因時間已到、而名譽會長浙江建設廳長曾養甫姗姗來遲、乃延至十時半舉行、並請曾開球、曾於此道素具興趣、惟年來久已荒疏、觸景生情、興味盎然、卽拾球作投籃之試、連擲五六次、卒未中的、曾身大體胖、復着極厚之棉袍、不覺已面紅氣喘矣、</p>
<p>裁判員敲鑼　開賽時計時員以小鑼一面、藉鳴金作健兒收兵之號令、至第二節終了、計時員鳴鑼聲音太低、東南英雌正包圍敵陣、幾乎投進一只、幸未命中、否則難免糾紛、裁判員舒鴻、執鎚用力鳴鑼數下曰、何不敲響一點、不然又要打開了、</p>
<p>女學生咋舌　杭市男女中等以上學校數不在少、年來對運動漸知注意、請體育敎授加緊訓練、球藝已大有進步、較之滬上則不免小巫見大巫也、此次聞兩江東南等各校女生、莫不以一度瞻仰爲快、故運動塲上衣香鬢影、羣雌粥粥、當在觀衆半數以上、見兩隊表演之精彩、形勢之緊張、不亞男子、咸爲咋舌不止云、</p>
<p>飛機散傳單　上午十時、球類表演賽開始、航空學校允運動會之請、特派飛機兩架、飛至會塲空際、散發傳單、駕駛人作種種姿勢、在空中作顚倒翻覆之飛行、看臺觀衆、大聲呌好、五彩傳單飛舞滿塲、觀客均你搶我奪、煞是好看、</p>
<p>林寳華趕到　林寳華爲滬上綱球明星、與邱飛海齊名、所向無敵、此次應該會之約、與鄭兆佳作表演比賽、昨日因事冗留滬、預料林鄭之單打、恐未能准時舉行、乃爲展期一日、詎林不願爽約、於中車由滬趕到、大會於賽前張貼秩序佈告、重行將林名列入、亦可謂不失信於觀衆矣、</p>
<p>保衛團戒嚴　會塲於開幕前特請杭市義務保衛團團員三十名、警士十名、維持秩序、大門口戒嚴、一般無參觀劵者、終不得其門而入也、上半日除由各學校書店代售者外、計售門票一千四百二十張、小洋二千八百四十角云、</p>

<p>差　···十四丨跌度···四</p>
<p>高峰一現立即下游</p>
<p>中央開現跌勢稍殺</p>
<p>全部過程速寫　昨市標金因外　倫敦大條近遠俱縮一二五、紐約銀價亦跌一二五、英美美英　匯兑、降下一分三七五、　電銀價亦小一二五、　匯市因大條脚地並不見佳、（收市後美國傾向買進）故英匯開盤、與前收　價、美匯則初開雖較前收略緊、開後卽鬆、標金亦然、開盤雖跳爲八百三十三兩二錢、升至二兩四錢後（又一新高價）卽見下游、大户見漲路被塞、遂相　疑、前有成豐永出　於先、（八百十八兩八錢）再有廣帮脱手於後、新價雖頻見、盤頭却多、咋市亦然、高價已成、但不知此種盤勢、由何人手創、價雖略行下游、但未過跌、大德成福餘　餘先下手爲强、匯市亦隨之而鬆、跌至念二兩五錢、幸有中央銀行來作中流之砥柱、繼續開現、遂轉和平、人心尙好、今將全市情形、分誌於後、</p>
<p>晨市由高而下　晨開受銀價見跌之影響、遂開高盤、爲八百三十三兩二錢、較前收又漲二兩半至二兩四錢、福餘等稍售、退至二兩二錢、然此際人凡尙好、金價遂在二兩間徘徊、及至大德成天豐永來出、華比亦售正月念七元、降爲三十兩五錢、散户稍納、升爲一兩、匯市趨鬆○六二五、正月可結、福餘恒餘慶發永脱手、價遂下游、無奈銀行内盤愈硬、匯豐出正月美匯已一二五、大德成　塲猛售、十分鐘内瀉下八兩、降爲念五兩二錢、匯豐掛牌英匯不動、美匯縮一二五、恒興來進、價始轉平、並聞中央有開現之訊、遂漲至七兩、無如匯市依然鬆濫、三月美匯三七五不能售、正月美匯一八七五可結、天豐永恒餘日昌等　出、又瀉三兩餘、爲念三兩五錢、元亨購條、價稍上升、此時三井售出三月美匯四三七五、而中央續有開現之舉、恒興同豐恒再進、拉十二兩、未幾回落　餘、而匯市亦轉平、正月美匯二五銀行要、遂好至六兩、最後由數錢升降之後、爲念五兩六錢收盤、物品拍五兩半、</p>
<p>後市漸歸平靜　下午開盤略小、爲念五兩、市况甚平、元春稍納、價遂略升、匯市轉佳、三月美匯二一二五可售、人心向上、漲至七兩光景、丙興福餘售出、價漸不支’但華比要　二月美匯三一二五、恒餘義豐永來進、漸至八　二錢、恒興　塲脱售、恒餘慶發永隨之而售、孟　電告漲起　安那、散户　售、一轉瞬間小去二兩七錢、而匯市並未带動、銀行做過四月美匯二七五、較上午緊秀、金價復盤　回升、重到八兩、恒興仍賣、又跌至三六兩内、而各號交易亦已散漫、大德成來進、升至七兩四錢、志豐永則出、盤旋者達半小時、至四時半爲二十六兩六錢收盤、物品拍七兩、查全市最高價八百三十三兩四錢、最低價八百二十三兩五錢、上落有九兩九錢、結果較前收回跌四兩一錢、</p>
<p>揭價多抑八兩　揭價因匯豐掛牌美匯縮一二四○○○合標金價、爲八百九十七兩二錢、照收盤言、約撳七十　餘、較前日多撳八兩、正月份登賬價八百二十六兩、二月份同價、補水八百二十三兩、</p>
<p>中央續開現貨六百餘條　中央銀行續開現貨約有六　餘條、價自二十四兩至二十五兩、較期貨約賤一兩、塲内由德成同豐恒恒興等代做、</p>
<p>交易數量仍薄　全市交易統計、福餘·天豐永·丙興·大興永·昌升永·慶發永·鴻興等爲賣方、福昌·兆豐昌·志豐永·元亨·　豐永·宏利·恒興·恒餘等爲買方、大德成上午猛出、下午稍進、現貨號則轉進、大連帮依然無大票交易、廣帮除恒興代客納進二百餘條外、益豐亦居於旁觀地位、所有二月份條額、截至二十九日止、共有一萬八千九百條、較前略增、</p>
<p>烚赤照加七兩半　烚赤連日平靜、中央肯降價開現、故價略行回漲、計照加七兩半、塲内成交不多、銀樓稍售、僅由盈豐恒納進、交易仍不滿百兩、</p>
<p>掉期盛極而衰　掉期交易、連日盛極、物極必反、昨市極少成交、乃因各現貨號得悉中央銀行確肯降價開現、較之期貨約差二兩、是以恒興雖肯貼進、前日之價、竟不　見、（多方貼出二兩半外）上午僅由盈豐恒以貼出二兩之價、向恒興掉正月至二月、約一百○五條、未幾中央開進現貨、其價與期貨相差僅一兩餘、掉期又告冷淡、直至下午始由盈豐恒貼出一兩、正月至二月向恒興掉一百七十五條、最後福昌與現貨號同豐恒竟做　掉、亦爲正月至二月者、計成交四百二十條、變幻之速、誠令人驚異也、</p>

<p>丨各有一二五起伏丨</p>
<p>昨市匯兑、外　倫敦大條雖縮、然脚地不佳、故英匯開盤與前收　價爲一先令七便士半、已露萎狀、其後預悉掛牌未動、金價下降、愈形轉鬆、入後平平、紐約銀價亦降一二五、英美美英　匯兑亦跌一分三七五、銀行私電亦小一二五、故開盤稍緊、但極形恍惚、近期計二十七元或二十六元九三七五、加　遠期銀市雖跌而不多、且最後之月份、跌勢較殺、金價回頭、故美匯亦靈時見鬆、掛牌雖小一二五、然大勢已去、無濟於事、銀行互有扒塞、結果英匯較前收硬起一二五、美匯則平、全日有一二五升降、</p>
<h3 id="c162">大條回長零六二五 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>

<p>本年商業市面不振、又兼一二八國難後、市面之蕭條、幾逾半載、始於下半年稍稍進展、乃以金融界不肯儘量放欵、以致欲活未活之商市、又發生經濟恐慌、卒至年終大結束時期、依然未見有巨大往來、故此屆總歸納情狀、遠不逮　年之旺盛、不過市面尙稱安謐、未有若何風潮、可自　也、</p>
<p>洋厘價平交淡銀　率由舊章　「洋厘」早市厘價爲七錢一分一厘六毫二忽半、午市異常冷淡、故交易方面亦屬　落、「銀拆」早午兩市同爲二分、與前日市價仍雷同、然形勢寛鬆、故連日非二分卽白借、銀劃頭加水昨又無行市矣、</p>
<p>江角午市狂漲銅元大致放長　江南小洋、早市爲六錢三分、較前日改昂二厘、午市同行方面買氣鼎盛、以致市價狂抬、收盤價較早市竟高一分零半厘之巨計爲六錢四分零半厘、做出交易、早市九千角、午市一萬七千角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢一分四厘、午市爲五厘半、兩市間雖昂一厘半、而較前日午市之價、似反小去一厘半、做出交易、早市六萬角、午市七萬五千角、銅元放長一千五百文、爲三百九十三千五百文、交易四萬零五百三十千零五百文、計　欵一萬零三百兩、</p>
<p>交易銀洋俱稀收解銀多洋寡　「銀欵」昨日銀行收解消息、因値大年夜僅距離一日、對全年中結束手續、亟須疏理、故形勢奇緊、華商收解票欵三百四五十萬、外商二百十餘萬、特欵五　餘萬、結欵收解六百餘萬、　匯欵五十餘萬、墊欵二百餘萬、　欵取贖一百四五十萬、各種貨匯税　諸欵收解九百四五十萬、出倉一百二十萬、錢莊　公單收解三千七百餘萬、　頭欵收解四百八十餘萬、各路匯欵六十餘萬、收現一百餘萬、「洋欵匯劃票欵、早市做出三十六萬、午市八十七萬五千、鈔票早市三萬、午市一萬、塲外鈔票早市六萬五千、午市五萬五千、支單交易、早市四萬、午市三萬、銀行交易、早市互市三十萬、午市六十萬、各銀行洋户　來收解一百七十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百四十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出一百四五十萬、洋　欵交易一百十餘萬、　路去胃三十餘萬、錢　洋公單收解八百四十餘萬、拆借洋欵一百四十餘萬、小錢莊交易五十餘萬、</p>

<p>十二月份鄭標花在七月始上塲、爲三十兩零一二錢、旋以美棉天氣變化、蟲害蔓延、八月八日美棉政府估計、產額减縮、市價飛漲八十餘磅音、市盤隨之上升、在八月間最高至三十五兩外、嗣至二次九月八日美棉估計發表、暴落一百餘磅音、世界棉市大爲震蕩、一落千丈、同時某廠商以國内氣候順適、棉產增加、在標花市塲大量抛出、包額積達二十萬擔以外、於是市氣頗有搖搖欲墜之勢、在十一月間最低峯曾見三十兩零零五分、嗣經各路來源缺乏、華棉在八九月間氣候不佳、北方雨水過多、黄河决口、棉產大受損害、產額由一千零八十二萬九千一百六十二擔减至八百零九萬四千八百六十三擔、人心尤緊一步、另有一部分鑒於某廠商抛出大量之額、缺貨交解、軋空盤勢特熖、市盤日趨上騰、最高至三十三兩五錢半、至於賣方視局勢洶洶、在天津搜買西河粗絨棉一萬多包、來滬交解、商塲上消息一播、市况突變、又回跌一兩、但有數廠决意收貨、粗絨棉未及來　、市盤又見漸漸向上、又至二兩外、結果最後一盤、爲三十二兩七錢、交割價爲三十三兩、殘餘二萬六千九百擔、實行交割二萬一千擔、其餘均係自行交割、貨品陜西花最多、火機有二千擔、收貨溥益廠及通底公司爲最多、交貨信誠號獨家、茲將收交兩方經紀人及牌號列表如后、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日來源較多、到六十餘艘、零胃轉暢、城鄉店客均以過年店存未足、採辦踴躍、包棧胃天津帮　路續湧、計售通　稻船頭念八號、數計三千餘石、因此行情飛騰、蘇同帮漲起角半、常帮高貨漲一角、中關貨價高二角、至於南港青角等帮　稻中關貨、飛提二角五分、高貨加起角餘、早稻亦漲一角、變元加高二角、陰元因酒壼帮去胃轉懈、價格僅提五分、洋杜尖到貨仍乏、價亦高起一角五分、回顧浦中存積雖厚、但以連日爲零　　胃去路暢旺、積存隨之减少、是以日後到船較少、去胃依然繼續、則價格當有上漲之望、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下到船四十餘艘、白粳堆户仍進取、零銷交平、價形　定、中次加近尺、杜埠尖高貨乏到、中次銷路頗佳、價亦挺立、陰元到少銷活、白元及羊尖價加尺許、薄稻亦加數分、客尖無榮辱、</p>

<p>— 侍</p>
<p>我從小很少有機會同着我的父親見面，我怕他像怕一個兇神似的，所以到現在每逢我在腦中幻想着他的面孔時，連一個輪廓也記不起來了，但有一次，他的面貌却總活現在我的心裏。　　那印象是極其不好的，在我們的家第一次破產後我正考入中學校的當兒，我的父親在重大的打擊下，連我們兄弟的學費都在爲難着了，我的叔父答應了這種負擔，但我的叔父也是一個典型的吝啬的富翁。於是在我和我的哥哥入校的前一晚，父親把我們呌到他的身邊，問我們所應交納的一切費用，他是以最緊縮的政策分配了各種费用，我們明知道他的分配是不夠用的，但也不敢說話，我的哥哥怕他是比我還要怕得厲害的。最後，因爲買被單的錢，我壯着膽子站在他的身背後說：「這至少要買兩條才夠替換的，」這話使得他憤怒了，他急轉頭來發着獰惡的眼神　着我說：「要買一百條丨」丨這種獰惡的像貌與聲音，其後便總印在我的心裏，我許多次努力想把這種記憶拂掉，但是總沒有成功，因爲我相信恐怕還不曾有過人類的父親對着他的孩子現過這樣怕人的獰惡的面　。</p>
<p>但我的父親是一個極有能幹的人，藉着我叔父的勢力，不久他又重興起他的家業。然而這像曇花一現似地，立刻又遭到了第二次更險惡的風波，經過這一次，我的父親便永不能再起，而我們的家也就漸漸陷在貧窮的深淵裏。</p>
<p>僥倖，在我們的家還能支持的時候，我獨斷地離開了國，跑到日本去。</p>
<p>沒有一日會使我安心的，每當我想起了我的家，！那不幸的家呀！</p>
<p>在經濟的風波之外，我的家是時常要吵打的。我的父親，在他最得意的時候，娶了一個姨母，被我的母親曉得了，我的母親要尋死，要去作尼姑，但是終被我們牽住了，可是這家庭，從此便變成了修　塲，在夜半，我們弟兄時常從夢裏驚醒，戰慄着心怯怯地聽着我母親的呌駡聲或東西的　打聲。</p>
<p>我怎樣的努力，也逃不開這　惑。在我　經　日本住　兩年之後，有一夜，我作了這樣一個夢：</p>
<p>「我好像再回到了我的那不幸家庭。</p>
<p>家，是兩間　屋，屋裏發着一種汚穢的氣味，一張破床，一張方桌，兩把椅子，另外什麽都沒有了。</p>
<p>我的哥哥　在床上呻吟着，面孔慘白，像是一個臨死的人。</p>
<p>我的弟弟！！那被一個不幸的家　苦着心的可憐的孩子，伏在方桌上啼哭。</p>
<p>我的父親皺着眉，徘徊在屋間的空地上：母親坐在床邊呌駡着。</p>
<p>像火花的一閃似地，他們毆打在一起；我想攔阻我的母親，但是她更暴怒了，對着我的胳臂上咬了一口。」</p>
<p>我痛苦地喊呌着從夢裏驚醒了。這時，在異國的天空上正現出薄明曙光。一個情感荒無了的孩子，居然眼裏也會湧出淚來了。（完）</p>

<p>— 杜衡</p>
<p>今天是一九三二年最後的一日，這是說·明天就是新年。然而近來，我們中國人是不過新年的。這也並不盡然是近來民生波蔽，百事摧毁，連一頓『年夜飯』都沒有一家人吃得起的原故，肯花三塊錢去看梅博士演劇的人還着實不少呢。我們中國人是放着新年不過·過舊年。假如你嘗試着革新，在今天買起猪頭·準備請起菩薩來·那麽·『難道你們過陽曆年的』？看見的人一定會詫異得對你這樣問。</p>
<p>問這句話的人一定不會覺得他是犯下了蔑視政府法令的重罪：旁的不說，就是『陽曆』兩個字就根本用錯了，他應當說『國曆』。</p>
<p>這國曆，原是我們的革命政府用斷然的革命手叚提倡出來的·當時花費的勁道的確很不小·至少比今年對付日本帝國主義的武力侵略所用的勁道要大得多·論到近幾年來的設施和革新，這一點實在有權利列入天字第一號。然而不幸得很，這國曆，大槪是爲了究竟不是道地的國貨之故，在我們四萬萬同胞中恐怕至少有三萬萬還用不慣·即如就過年來說·也恐怕至少有三萬萬人在過着舊年：至於新年·那是恐怕連想也想不起來。</p>
<p>即如我。雖然未必落伍到連想也想不起，但要不是今天拿着筆找題目做文章的話，那便恐怕也會把这個新的年三十忘記了。</p>
<p>說起忘記。一九三二年倒的確是中國人表現得最健忘的一個年頭。從我們的兗兗諸公起·一直到賤夫走卒止·差不多誰都忘記了一九三二是在砲火中誕生的：比到這，前面所說起的過年不過年的事情，眞不知要小到多少。眞的，我們又何必把這些事情苦苦地記在心裏呢。砲火是遠了，科學縱然發達，然而聲音可以傳到三千里那麽遠的大砲却始終沒有發明出來，我們沒有順風耳。自然落得清靜：縱然有代替順風耳用的無線電，然而無線電裏是祇聽到梨園歌管聲，在耳根依然是一片昇平景像，我們還是落得清靜，清靜而且忘記。</p>
<p>好，我們把一九三二年連同她的一切都忘記吧·讓牠悄悄地過去，而等待着當然又是國泰民安的一九三二年的來到。</p>

<p>— 傅東華</p>
<p>動盪時代信仰多；動盪時代無信仰。信仰多等於無信仰。若有人問我有沒有信仰，我說有，有有：</p>
<p>我相信地球是圓的。</p>
<p>我相信全體大於部份·部份小於全體。</p>
<p>我相信七乘七等於四十九，七加七等於一十四。</p>
<p>我相信凡人都有死。</p>
<p>我相信沒有性交不會生兒子。</p>
<p>我相信經咒不能救國。</p>
<p>我相信信不過自已無寗死。</p>
<p>··································</p>
<p>信仰和迷信原是姊妹行·因此有許多人誤認迷信作信仰。</p>
<p>信何至於迷呢？</p>
<p>我有個從美國研究「領袖術」（ＡitofLeadrsh　)回來的朋友告訴我，「倘若××政府每月給我五百元，我就會迷信××主義」。這眞是至理名言，一語破的！</p>
<p>從知所謂美國的「領袖術」也者，即以五百元，五十元，乃至五元，五角，五分之符，籙而使人迷信之術也。領袖而無信徒，斯不成其爲領袖矣。領袖各率其值得五百，五十，五元。五角，五分之各等信徒而與其他領袖戰，而於是乎天下　。</p>
<p>動盪時代無信仰，有之唯領袖的信仰‘而領袖的信仰乃亂因也。</p>
<p>人各自信信眞理，而不信領袖，則天下太平矣。</p>
<p>然而這五百，五十，乃至五元·五角，五分也者，是如此其必要而捨不得，然則亂乃人類之定命歟！曰是在敎育。</p>
<p>（附註：鄙見與豈凡先生的「排天才」大致一樣，唯對豈凡先生的「尊愚論」不能贊同。因爲天才的主要因素之一就是别人之愚。）</p>

<p>— 振甫</p>
<p>牠奏着低低的音樂，牠彈着　微的弦　，就祇這幽妙的景地，也足使人神往了。牠是在山的泉，牠永不流到山外去，當然能够保持着永久的純潔了。</p>
<p>我們從鉢盂泉出來，就到山上去。山上的石級，很巧妙地就原有的石頭　成。山路曲折，一　間花野草，不時的牽住了我們的衣服，警告我們不要前進；難道天然的風景，不許人們來窺探嗎？難道恐怕上面的危險難走嗎？但是我們終於不理牠們而鼓勇上前了。怪石是滿目皆是，都好像經過了鬼斧神工的刻　，有的直立着，似乎非常的尊嚴，有的　臥着，表示異樣的閒適，有的披着青綠的苔衣，有的戴着紅綠的小花，有的好像負傷的困獸，身上被人們刻了許多傷痕，作出橨怒的形狀。當我們前進的時候，一塊大石横立在路中，我們不得不低着頭向牠的下面穿過。有的參天矗立，攔住去路，我們不得不轉換方向。有一處一塊大石怱裂爲二，我們不得不在牠的裂縫中進行，所謂一線天者是也。半山以上，已經沒有路徑了。我們從石上翻過去，攀住了葛藤，經過了多少次的轉折，方才到了山頂。在山頂上，我們可以望見蘇州境内起伏的峯　，我們可以望見隱約的太湖，我們可以望見縱横的田疇和鱗次的屋宇，好比做一度的鳥瞰。因爲　趕去趁木瀆的汽船，可惜我們不能久留就怱怱的下山了。　　山脚下的楓樹，雖則僅有一部分漸漸的紅了，而地上小的楓葉，却已像新喝了酒似的非常紅了，像怕見生人的小兒女，一日遇見了我們這些客人便羞得滿面通紅似的，這是何等可愛的紅啊！這是值得贊美和謳歌的。我們採了許多枝，带着太陽，踏着沙沙的草，在蘆花點頭送我們和樹枝奏着自然的歌聲中，我們歸去了。下面是一首紀念天平山的詞：</p>
<p>猙獰怪石眞堪怖，都向天平駐。米顚倘向此山來，料應拜倒一步幾徘徊。可憐楓葉紅初始，靈秀皆鍾此。殷懃折取一枝枝。爭如紅豆一樣最相思。調寄　美人</p>
<p>等到我們到了木瀆，汽船已在幾分鐘前開去了，僅僅幾分鐘。但是又有什麽法子呢？於是我們開始步行，從木瀆到蘇州，不過二十七里路，當不至行困難的。</p>
<p>夕陽漸漸地淡下去了，從白色的光彩變成黄金色，淡淡地舖在地上草上樹枝上，當她的光線舖到水面上去的時候，一部分被帆船带去了；一部分舖在水面上的，又被槳聲和微波攪亂了，攪成幾千點的光明，耀到人們的眼睛上。我們背着太陽，沿着塘岸，在這金黄色的太陽光洒滿了的世界中走路，這是多麽幸福啊！</p>
<p>我們走到了横塘，使我們懷念那明末時候的陳圓圓了。吳梅村不是明白的告訴我們，「前身合是採蓮人，門前一片横塘水」麽？不是又告訴我們，「横塘雙槳如飛，何處豪家强載歸」麽？我們對了這一片横塘碧水，追想圓圓當時的情狀，不是很夠我們玩味嗎？随便凑幾句來作紀念罷：</p>
<p>横塘碧水清如許，空憶浣秒侣。忽忽一過又回頭，芳草斜陽惆悵水東流。圓圓艶蹟知何處，楓冷吳江渚。芳魂月下莫歸來，神州烽火依舊亂相催。調寄虞美人</p>
<p>當我們在流連着横塘的時候，太陽暗暗地被帆影带走了，被水流去了，僅有的我們背着的一部份，又被歸巢的　鴉背了带走。幸得嫦娥的銀燈，已經高掛，所以我們從金黄色的太陽光中，轉到鐘光的世界中來，使我們體味着幽靜的夜的世界，這是多麽幸運的事啊！在繁星密布似的燈光中，我們微笑地回到蘇州了。</p>

<h3 id="c196">「看」和「逃」 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 沈剛甫</p>
<p>「看」和「逃」·是中國人的兩套看家拳。</p>
<p>從娶新娘出棺材抄靶子打相打以至於兩條黄狗當街性交·莫不會哄動閒人若干　看得津津有味：逢着大火燒，更　熱閙，人從四處八方趕來看，　出人命來也未足爲奇的。</p>
<p>然而，如果看火燒而聽說燒斷了沿馬路的電線的話，一羣人便立刻會拔脚轉身，亡命飛跑，大顯其逃的本領，是亦勢所必然。</p>
<p>這其間　也有聰明朋友，索性把「看」和「逃」併爲一談，事情就有點滑稽，就像滬戰時，日本浪人在北四川路發威，中國人看的一大羣，浪人皮鞭一揮，中國人便一面逃，一面看。</p>
<p>乃至對於國家大事，中國人亦無不如此：義勇軍在關外冰天雪地中血戰，關裏人却像在看三本鐵公鷄，圍着火爐看牠結局如何：一旦日本軍隊開到上海，便茫茫然如喪家之犬，抱頭鼠竄，逃之夭夭。</p>
<p>然而，隔岸觀火，雖非美德，巖牆不立，則確　君子之道，中國禮義之邦，鳥可以無君子哉，</p>
<p>故或人曰：中國要亡國，因爲中國人只會「看」，然而中國不會滅種，因爲中國人會「逃」！</p>
<h3 id="c197">歲暮的惆悵 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 符</p>
<p>朔風怒號，大地回春。這酷寒殘冬，就要和我們告别了。</p>
<p>走到家裏，看看那壁上的一九三二年的日曆已只剩了薄薄的幾頁；走到街裏，那憧憧的人影和送年的彩燈，又在我的眼底裏閃耀，觸目驚心，到處在告訴我已是歲暮，一九三二年的歲暮。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，人們　了一歲之終，總照例要　别地忙一番的。各人總不免起了各種各樣的情緒，這情緒究竟包含着些什麽，我可不大清楚，留戀這僅存的幾天吧？寄望於未來的新年吧？但是，就常理論之，後者　多於前者吧。這可咒詛的一九三二年　還留戀　？我們自然期望着新年一九三三！</p>
<p>於是，你看：馬路旁　測字攤上的先生，不是已在揮筆直書「國泰民安」「五穀豐登」的春聯？預備到了新年，就一齊掛貼起來，這是希望未來的表記。今年的財運不好，都希望明年發財，今年的官運不「亨」，總希望明年陞官，今年内亂外患的頻仍，都希望明年化爲「國泰民安」，這樣，人們都憧　着就要到來的美滿的新年，那還會情願留戀這烏烟瘴氣殘留的歲月？</p>
<p>我郤並不這樣想。我不是沒有着希望，然而，我每每希望着「未來」，而結果未來反使我陷於失望的悲哀。到後來往往「未來」反還不及過去。所以，如果過去的事實要是永遠這樣繼續下去的話，我再也不　有什麽希望了。</p>
<p>前年的歲暮，人們不是熱望着「去年」嗎？然而，我們現在試回顧去年，無論那一方面可比前年進步了？東北淪亡，洪水氾濫，荒收成災，「去年」那裏及得來前年？去年的歲暮，大家都悲痛着九一八的恥辱，巴不得把倒楣的「一九三一」快些送過去，而寄望於今年，那曉得一過新年，便是滬戰爆發，遍地内亂，甚至豐收也成災，今年又那裏及得來去年？，一年一年地過去，一年不如一年，這是鐡般的事實！這樣下去，對於未來的新年，我眞不　有什麽希望了！因此，我對這彌留的歲暮，倒反覺得有留戀的意味。</p>
<p>荏苒又是一年！我們對於新年且慢懐着奢望，我們把將要過完的今年，從頭回溯一番吧。　　　一二，二四。</p>

<p>我·······我，我······我·······</p>
<p>他疊連的說了幾個我字，急忙忙的又兜了一個圈兒，走進第四衖裏來了。　　立在最後一家廚房門口，笑吟吟的等着他來的不就是那個嬌小活潑的卓淑華麽？</p>
<p>『蜜司脫林，對不住了，今晚上冷呢。』</p>
<p>『還好。』</p>
<p>他沒有預想到卓淑華竟肯伸出手掌來和他握手。使他驚異的是　的手和他的一樣的冰冷，似乎他的還比　的暖和一點。</p>
<p>踏進了後門。看見火廚裏異常的不整潔，或横或縱。排着兩三個小煤灶。有兩個衣裳渥濁的媂人在微暗的電光下洗盤碗。</p>
<p>（十四）</p>
<p>由卓淑華的領導，海泉走上她們樓上的前樓房裏來了。才踏進房門，忽然聽見一陣悠掦的鋼琴音。</p>
<p>『你家裏有鋼琴？』</p>
<p>海泉問卓女士。</p>
<p>『不。那是隔壁的。』</p>
<p>前樓房裏不見一個人，也沒有防寒的設備。他走進來。仍然感着冷氣襲襲的。這房裏的陳設雖不像廚房的凌亂渥濁，但也沒有特别的家具，一般的鐵床，一般的鏡台，一般的桌凳，在房正中有一張大八仙檯，檯上擺着一盤紅瓜子，和幾個茶杯。最令他注目的是，梳妝台傍邊裝有電話機。</p>
<p>『請坐吧，蜜司脫林。』</p>
<p>她招呼他在八仙桌前的一把椅子上坐下來後，也和他作直角的方向，取了位置坐下來。海泉坐在卓女士的面前似乎很拘束的，一時無話可說，也不敢仰起頭來看她。他勉强裝出笑的表情，以减少他的漸怍。</p>
<p>『蜜司脫林，對不住啊！』</p>
<p>她笑着把瓜子盤端前來給他。他無意識地揑了幾粒。在這瞬問他乘勢看了卓淑華一眼，她的臉上滿堆着親暱的笑容。他想，這確夠消受了。在學校裏的女同學們，那一個不是架子大得要死，那裏有像她這樣親暱，這樣客氣的。</p>
<p>『你住在這裏？』</p>
<p>海泉乘勢問了她。</p>
<p>『··················』</p>
<p>她沉吟了一忽，才點了點頭。</p>
<p>『······不過，蜜司脫林，你莫告訴任何一個同學喲。』</p>
<p>『張應奎曉得吧？』</p>
<p>『他不曉得，我沒告訴他。』</p>
<p>她此刻的態度轉正經起來，歛了笑容了。</p>

<p>— 天方</p>
<p>在這饑荒失業，騒擾，充滿着矛盾的時代，全世界十六萬萬人口中希望上帝來搭救的人們，在瘋狂地慶祝這「聖誕佳節」。不差，聖經上的話原是很動聽。的而吐綬雞又那樣的可口。聖誕村又那樣的美麗。連環甲荷戈的戰士們，丨不信耶穌的川中將士們除外丨也得一日歡迎。這何怪羅馬敎皇要引以爲「欣慰。」不信。請看報載。</p>
<p>路透社二十三日羅馬電，巴拉圭與玻璃維亞兩國政府，已通知羅馬敎皇，聲明願遵敎皇所提出耶誕節休戰之議，故自耶誕節前夜十時起，至耶誕節夜十時止，查谷森林境内停止戰爭，敎皇對此，表示欣慰，並希望此舉可導成兩國間之永遠和平云。</p>
<p>砲彈飛來。血肉飛去。原是一種可拍的景象。倘在。「聖誕佳節」。而猶砲火相餉。豈不是大煞風景。使人疑心到上帝已不管地面上的事情了。這如何使得。所以對於波巴。</p>
<p>兩國停戰二十四小時的事。不獨上帝的代表。丨敎皇。「表示欣慰。」即遠在千萬里外。得不到好處。吃不到苦頭的我。也引以爲。「欣慰。」我所引以爲欣慰的是死去千餘年，千萬人崇奉的耶穌，至今還有些些微效，又豈止是兩國該死的寃魂，得以苟延一日之殘喘而已哉。所可惜的，是停戰的時間，只有「二十四小時，」而「永遠和平」還不過是一個「希望」而已，</p>
<p>講到「和平」的「希望」我們懐之不爲不久，從第一個聖誕數起，到今天已是一千九百三十又二個聖誕了。朝朝暮暮，念在牧師的嘴裏，聽在人民的耳裏，未嘗不像煞有介事，然而「博愛」兩字，至今還是一張不兑現的支票，社會似乎比二千年前耶穌傳道的時候，並未改善得分毫。反而加劣。我們還記得當一千九百十四年世界大戰發生時，各國的敎士們，不是喊着「爲上帝而戰」「爲正義而戰」嗎？可是究竟誰是爲着上帝。誰是爲着正義我們至今還是茫然。只苦了這批。該死的英雄生命是爲野心家所浪費了。這次一千萬以上的死亡。二千二百三十四萬。萬元（美金）的戰費。不能不呌上帝負担着一部份消費的責任。</p>
<p>本來希望「和平」决不是空言所能奏效，「博愛」也頗有限制，天主敎徒决不會愛耶穌敎徒，浸禮會也决不禮拜美以美會，這還是信奉着同一的上帝。更不要。說對於異敎徒的敵視了。「非戰公約」原只是國際間的一種裝飾品，而「聖經」也不過是一部「廢話」對弱者進攻時或可用以麻醉麻醉對方的意志，如「打你右臉，再給以左臉」之類的迷藥，碰到强者。就不客氣完全無效。非打個明白不可。决不來。受你美言的誘惑。所以空唱了一千九百餘年的「博愛」還免不了一塲世界大流血，免不了把人家做奴隸，原因是不揣其本而妄想齊其末的緣故。所以時有自打嘴巴的事情發現，退一步說。「正義」而果靠敎士們維繫。那末這班吃。「上帝飯。」的人。眞也太不盡責了。死去一定不得救。</p>
<p>墨索里尼說。「空言雖美長槍大砲尤美。」威爾遜說。「公理要以武力爲後盾」希望得救的人們。聽着吧。亞們。</p>

<p>— 順基</p>
<p>㈠甘藷做酒精的方法，拿甘藷細細的洗凈，放在鍋上，隔水蒸熱，用刀切成薄片，而後放在石臼裏面，用捧打爛；等到温度稍低，大槪在華氏寒暑表一百二十度左右，另把麥芽的碎屑拌匀，并且再注入熱水，使牠變做稀而薄的液汁；於是再等到冷以後，倒入用棉布做成的袋裏，榨出糖汁，使糖汁滴入桶裏；再另外有發酵作用的酵母，過了一天，糖汁的表面上，便發生無數的小泡，後來漸漸减少，不能上浮：再倒入蒸溜器裏，蒸成氣體，遇着了冷，漸漸凝結，又變做液體，這液體那就呌酒精了。　　㈡玉蜀黍做酒精的方法，把玉蜀黍從軸上剝下，隨即放在石臼裏面，而後打碎；另在玉蜀黍粉每重一百磅的中間，加水二十磅，再加入淡硫酸三四磅，用捧須拌得很匀；於是再放在鍋上蒸熱，使牠變做漿糊一般；等牠冷後，放在磨裏磨碎，拌入麥芽的碎屑；過了幾個鐘點，冲入熱水，那麽就變做有甜味的糖液；再在細密的滤器裏，把糖液濾出，加入拿麥做成的酒麴；這樣再過了一二天，糖液漸漸的發酵，所生的小泡，起先是很多的，到後來漸漸的减少；等到沒有小泡浮出的時候，再行蒸做氣體，而後使牠漸漸冷起來，等冷以後，那麽又變做液體，這樣就是酒精了。酒精的用處。丨因爲酒精是有芳香的無色液體，易溶各種藥品，故製造假漆，香水及碘酒等用以做溶劑。其性易於燃燒，熱度也高强，所以用以點燈；及新近發明出來的酒精熨斗，用以燙平衣服，又有防腐的功能，動植物等浸在酒精中經久不腐。由此可見酒精的功用，也可想而知了。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3 id="c201">嚴重而難解决的問題 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我讀了本月二十四日張頣園先生的通訊「跑進商店後身體壞了」以後，非常之同情。他所提出的問題，是一個很重要的社會問題，並不是不個簡單的小事情，所以値得大家來討論的，編者對張先生的回答，我相信並不能滿足張先生的要求：第一；沒有指出張先生所以不健康的原因；第二，編者所提出的辦法，是張先生在實際上所做不到的。</p>
<p>張先生自己說：『自從進了舊式商店以後，便不因不由地漸漸消瘦下去』。這裏我敢回答：是因爲張先生每天要做十二點鐘以上的工作，沒有多餘的時</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>間來休息，以致積勞而消瘦成病；自然此外還有不良的待遇和意外的束縛，例如張先生想在每日清晨練習打拳的事情，都要受經理的干涉，認爲有越常軌。那其餘的可不必說了。</p>
<p>不錯，呼吸新鮮空氣可以强身。然而張先生在事實上爲了自己的吃飯問題；爲了要養活家小問題；勢不能離開城或者要搶死搶活的吃飯，或者餓過了火也還不能吃，那裏談得到節制飲食！至於說什麽「食後散步，做點愉快性情的事和其他運動」，這只有高等的自由人才有權利做得到。出賣勞力的平民，在現在的不平等的剝削的社會裏，是絕對的不可能！根本問題不能解决，高唱什麽體育德育智育並重等等，都是徒然的　　日規</p>
<p>市而到鄕下去。再則，一早起來就要趕着店務，那有必須時間去吸新鮮空氣；舉行柔軟體操也至少要十五分鐘，這十五分鐘的時間那裏來呢？何况他的經理老板，也要認爲這是「有越常軌而大爲不然。」飲食的營養，自然是好辦法！然而店員每月所得的薪水很少，平日所吃的包飯，不能得到多分的營養品也是事實。至於飲食有節制，也不是做店員的可以辦到的事情，事情忙起來時候，。</p>
<p>只有每個勞動者自己覺悟起來，團結起來，爲着爭取自己應有的一切權利而鬥爭；要求八小時工作制，改良待遇，增加工資，才是正當的途徑，才是根本的辦法，然後說得上其他的問題。</p>
<p>這是我讀了「店員通訊」後的感想，希望編者先生在貴欄裏披露，若是編者先生認爲沒有披露可能的，那就請轉給張先生自己。然而我是希望登載的。如有不同意處，可加以指導。</p>
<h3 id="c202">出租房子的故事 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>二房東之所以抱定「寗可房租輕點但不可沒有家眷」，的主張，爲的是過去就吃了沒有顧及到這點的虧，以致弄出不少的麻煩，甚至拖下幾個月的房租，一夜間便溜之大吉，但一顧及到要有家眷才租，却又錯過了許多可租的機會，亭子間已空上三個月了，雖然曾來得不少的人要借，但總缺少二房東要家眷的條件，</p>
<p>房東太太覺得房子老是空着，實在可惜，但是二房東的脾氣是怪硬的，隨她如何說，總不肯稍作通融，而她則以爲只不再租給穿長褲脚的學生，因爲上次溜之大吉的便是穿長褲脚的學生，其餘倒不必顧慮許多，</p>
<p>這樣果然亭子間由房東太太租掉了</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>，是租給一位蘇州姑娘，房東太太以爲是如此停當的姑娘，那總不會失事的，二房東知道了，却更是搖頭，</p>
<p>姑娘說是在××絲廠做工，但伊的模樣，却不像一個工人，又說有丈夫在　城幹差事，但伊却常有男朋友晚上來伴伊睡覺，這些都使二房東越想越疑越不安，而房東太太却深信女人總不會比男人壞，至說伊或有不正經之處，那是城市女人十個有九個如此，</p>
<p>一個月過去了，相安無事，房東才放了三四分心、房東太太更覺得女人到底不比男人壞，</p>
<p>第二個月第三個月也相安的過去了，而且是先期繳納房租，而且沒有什麽牽带，只稍爲不好的，是半夜裏還有人客出出進進，</p>
<p>姑娘的話，果然不謊，伊的一位丈夫從日轉來了，由此房東也便放心了，因爲已具備了他的條件，而且無形間不知清靜了多少，尤其是夜間，</p>
<p>但不知怎樣，近來姑婚總是愁眉愁臉，似乎有什麽心事似的，然當了伊丈夫的面時却又看不出有什麽異樣，房東太太見伊這樣，便時常找伊來談談心，或是請伊過來吃東西，因爲已有了半年同居的關係，她們固有了相當的友誼，有時房東太太錢不應手，也會向伊借貸過三五十塊，姑娘從不向她討，隨她什麽時候還，當還給伊的時候，伊還要客氣其詞地說，「倷拿去用好了，刻息（這時候）阿拉還弗要用咯」，這更使房東太太覺得伊確然不比男人壞，簡直是一個最可靠的女子，</p>
<p>早幾天伊忽然向房東太太說，「婆婆死了，需要寄點錢回去，這幾天我們手邊很不活動，想向太太貸三十塊錢，過三天就還」，適巧房東太太儲有一筆繳付大房東的房金在手，馬上便貸給了伊，</p>
<p>三天過後，大房東來收房租了，房東太太便上亭子間去，見了姑娘的丈夫有哭臉，她安慰似地對他說，「先生，令慈旣已百歲了，也用不着過分傷心」　　姑娘的丈夫愕然回答，「家慈並沒有死，只是我的妻子逃走了」，</p>
<p>「哈妻子逃走了呀，伊還借去了我三十塊錢哩，········房東太太茫然了，</p>

<p>— 彭年</p>
<p>十三號的英，近日不知爲了甚麽：挹鬱寡歡，愁容莫展，似乎非常不悅意。烏油似的頭髪，已好幾天不見梳沐了，蓬鬆得比松毛還要亂；她認爲最合意最時髦的幸福縐一件旗袍，又多日不着在身上，根比馬蹄還要小的一雙高跟皮鞋，平日她是慣穿着的，今天又不在玲瓏的脚上了。這眞是一件不可思議而很奇怪的事。「她怕在矯正奢華生活了嗎？那末，埀頭喪氣怎何呢！」我這樣地思索着。</p>
<p>時代的巨輪不停底旋進，在我幻想的一刹那，過去又是一星期了。在那天魚白打破黑沉沉環境放曉的晨光，我正好夢初回，外面忽然起了一種驚奇的聲音，停了一會，弄内的人聲鼎沸，冷靜得和死後出殯一般的早晨空氣，頓呈囂張的氣象，一班人口裏只嚷着：</p>
<p>「英···不好了···甚麽···英···」這時坐在被窼裏的我，已被她們驚擾由朦朧而清醒了。但是還沒有曉得外面究竟是甚麽一件事，只是在心中循環迴旋猜想着。</p>
<p>弄内的空氣漸漸地消沉下去，人聲的高潮蝟集在十三號了。於是我由催想而入疑惑英的途徑，「怕英自殺了嗎？看她近日的樣子，或者···」在我這樣縈思的時候，隔壁老史怱怱地進來了。氣急大喘的對我說：</p>
<p>「老樓：十三號的英，昨夜自縊身死了。」</p>
<p>「甚麽？甚麽？她自缢了嗎？」我驚異的問？</p>
<p>「她爲甚麽自殺的？」我又問了一聲。</p>
<p>「這是我不能曉得，恐怕别人都在猜想她自殺的原因。」</p>
<p>「怕她爲戀愛而自殺的?」我頓思起她上學期在××大學的一段戀愛史，這樣地自問着。</p>
<p>穿好衣服，急急地跑到她的家裏，可是家人都在痛哭流涕，悲慟欲絕，看看英的屍體，又使我嘔喟，因之不得不止於發問。後來英的父親出來，略約地問了一問，果然不出我意料之外，她是爲戀愛而自殺的呀！</p>
<p>由此，引起了她的過去的思波：她是××大學敎育系的學生，一班浪蜂狂蝶的男學生，都拜倒她的石榴裙下。因爲她的一副天然嬌艶之貌，確易使人迷醉五里霧中，誘入情綱。所以她有「學校花」「梅花之神」的雅號。</p>
<p>懷春正濃的她，加以缺少理智，在不久的過去，就和獵艶能手Ｂ君戀上愛，繼而發生肉體上關係，從此一幕的演過去，她們的情感肉慾，已經達到極度的高潮，簡直不能抑止的了。</p>
<p>男子終於缺少情義，在他們甘密生活過程中，Ｂ君又戀愛上一個妙齡少女，琵琶别抱，嫌此歡彼，對她漸漸地憎惡起來，後來簡直白眼相加，常起勃谿，結果，他們的愛情完全破產了。到了今日，英竟香消玉殞了。</p>
<p>靑年的學生們，戀愛不是你們光明的前程，是堕落的陷阱。請你們快自省吧！不要再猶豫了。</p>

<p>在從前，任憑你找隨便什麽地方去看吧，校内大路上，樹林子裏，竹籬中，茅亭内，都可以看到哥兒和小姐們談着，笑着，講着甜蜜蜜的話，吃着甜蜜蜜的糖，並肩坐着的有，手挽手兒走着的也有，早晨有，晚上更有，這些，我們不去說它，他她們在你愛我，我更愛你咧，就說自流井的水塔底下和旗杆下四週的石級上吧，也不斷的有同學坐在那裏胡講，Ａ一面剝着花生，Ｂ用力在吸他的香烟屁股，有的看小說，有的唱璇宮艶史裏的英文歌，有的哼廣東調。更有味兒的是我們班裏的學究，一個人冷清清地坐在荒僻的草坪上在讀古文，現在，天冷了，一切的一切都被西北風捲走了，於是「字紙簏」的把戲又出現在我們的眼前。</p>
<p>這「字紙簏」說也奇怪，牠在夏末秋初還沒有，就因爲是西北風那樣的貶膚欲裂，牠才應運而生，并且都生在小姐們身上，假使她摩登和家境殷實一些，那麽少不得要带着兩個「字紙簏」！大衣或拉毛短大衣上的兩個口袋！</p>
<p>怎麽會起了這個名兒？有來由的：</p>
<p>密司張雖不能算我們的皇后，但是她那　而　　　實幽靜而富於情感，　何况她　長於文學和演講呢？她最惹人注目的，便是她的明眸皓齒，和逗人的睨視，可是，她雖愛睨視，却又寓着極端的莊嚴，愈莊嚴，愈顯得她值得羡慕！愈睨視，愈顯得她可愛！可是，大家祇有私心裏愛她，在愛的途徑上，不容發動一點，别說如何進展了。</p>
<p>天冷了，她早就着起拉毛短大衣，哥兒們正苦無法可施，恰恰她大衣上兩個口袋天天張着大嘴似乎在等東西吃一般，有位廣東同學阿梁，他和她常時靠近着坐位，於是寫許多小紙條向她口袋裏抛去，有時像投壼，有時像扒兒手一般偷偷摸摸的，說也好玩，我們的政治學敎授似乎已瞥見一眼，密司張却絲毫不知。</p>
<p>下了課，又上課了，密司張又跑進來了，不知到袋裏去摸什麽，一摸摸到了好幾個紙團，却把牠抓了出來，漲紅了臉，當看了一條還不完時便恨着咕嚕道：</p>
<p>誰這麽無聊呀？把我的口袋當「字紙簏」嗎？</p>
<p>同時，密司李，密司陸，·····好幾位同學，也都從大衣袋裏摸到了幾個小紙團，男同學笑得東倒西歪丨女同學怒氣冲天。</p>
<p>結果，大家都忘了要上課一般，好在正巧臨時布告敎員因事告假，妙極！妙極！這笑聲便由敎室裏带到敎室外面去了。</p>

<p>— 方天</p>
<p>日曆已翻到最後幾頁，心緖也不比尋常，近來看報怕見「冬季大減價」一類的名詞，因爲由於「冬季」兩字，會使你想到「債」上去，何况這年頭，討債問題又這樣風行於世界，新近法國的内閣不是爲債逼倒的嗎，</p>
<p>「窮」固非「病」但「舉債」「還債」倒是頗費思量的事，照自然淘汰說起來一個人弄倒「畢的生司」「囊空如洗」的時候，該是自己的不爭氣，怨不來他人怨不來天，只好退避三舍，就此不吃飯，免得再叨擾人世，但「生存」是人類共有的大慾，决不因此自加原諒，而事情也頗有不然的，於是便有所謂「借債」，</p>
<p>「借債」是人間酬酢中最難作得好的事，丨向外國大借欵除外丨書面，　似乎太不親切，而口頭又期期難出於口，所以借債時的神情，雖說不上「惶恐」，但至少有點「模糊」我也曾借過債，當我開口訴說時，我總覺得有點把弱點示人的感想，丨雖說「緩急人之所時有也」，但我這小布爾喬亞的尊貴性始終還未脫除盡凈，在朋友前總覺相形見絀，當我走出大門時總是如釋重負長舒了一口氣，說出來不怕寒氣逼人，大槪「小貧」才有這種現象，至於千萬百萬的借欵，一定堂而皇之，絲毫不覺得慚愧，於此我又自慚「落伍」了，</p>
<p>從借債更想到一般的事實「債台高築」固不是體面的事，但至少也可表示自己的身份，能夠舉債上萬，當然愈多愈闊！社會上决不以你窮人相待，獨在這不景氣的境况中有多數人是債台都築不起來，那才夠可憐哩，不要遠說到農工歲尾年頭，聽都市的破產聲吧，</p>

<p>㈤東家老爹來了</p>
<p>這一塲談話，王二嫂也就覺得孟先生眞是個同情的人，他說的話都有理。二人隔了一個塘角，就有一句沒一句向下談着。後來有兩個牽牛的孩子，將牛牽到塘邊來喝水。孟國寳不便望下說，就起身走了。到了這天晚上，又來繼續着說城裏的事情。他說到綢緞店，料子能堆得像山一樣，賣胭脂花粉的店，過他的大門口，都是香的。戲園子裏唱戲，一定带佈景，唱到有山的時候，台上眞有山，唱到有水的時候，台上眞有水。王二嫂眞個越聽越有味，又到夜深方散。孟國寳次日上午起來，還不曾矻飯，就將在城裏带回來送人的剩餘禮物，檢了幾樣，用手絹包子提着，向王老二家送來。剛走到門口，只見王二嫂手提了一隻宰剝好了的鷄：要向塘邊走去，看到了孟國寳就笑着呌了一聲孟先生，扶了路旁一枝樹站着，向他微笑着。孟國寳無甚可說的，只有那樣一句敷衍話，老二在家嗎？王二嫂道：東家老爹來了，他在堂屋裏陪着呢，我想把鷄收拾好了，就呌他去請孟先生來吃晚飯的，巧是孟先生就來了。我炒了瓜子，燒了熱茶，你請到裏面坐。他聽說王老二在陪東家老爹，就有些不願進去，可是轉念一想，自己是來調查農村經濟狀况的，參與着東家和佃户這一個談話，多少也許可以得些材料，便向王二嫂笑道：我這裏有點小東西，送給二嫂用，請你不必說我送的，就說是我母親送你的吧？</p>

<h3 id="c207">好萊塢的預言家說琪恩哈羅的將來（下） <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 凛</p>
<p>好萊塢的預言家，除掉𨳐尼佛林之外，還有大理奥和馬龍諾佛爾兩位。大理奥是位星象家，並且能够相手紋，透觀心理。他對於琪恩哈羅的將來，觀測與𨳐尼佛林稍有不同。他說琪恩將來必成大名，但幸福是無分的。她將於兩年之内嫁於一位同影業稍徵有些關係的人，但這次的婚姻，仍將以悲劇爲結局。經過這次悲劇之後，再隔了兩三年，又要同一位與保羅博恩智慧相同的人結婚。她敬愛他，他亦歸順她如倦鳥之還巢。但二人之間，終不能得到圓滿快樂，因爲琪恩哈羅是天生就不能得夫婦之樂趣的。她將繼續在影界盡力，而得大成功，但命運多舛，終身雖望有快樂之望。第三位預言家馬龍諾佛爾是天文學者，他善觀星象，判定吉凶。他於保羅博恩未死兩星期之前，曾指示於名導演格雷菲士不久將有一位影界大人物自殺，他說保羅的自殺，係由於一種極微渺而極兇險的星象振動所造成。他說琪恩哈羅生於三月三日，係屬於水形的；保羅生於十二月十三日，係屬於火形的；而管理影戲事業的星象係海王星。所以琪恩和保羅一箇屬水的，一箇屬火的，一同放在海王星同一分野之内，猶如將水火二物，放在一隻瓶裏，水火自然要互相尅制，互相併滅。這次當然是水勝於火，保羅終不能逃出自殺之一途。因此看來，琪恩同保羅本來就不應當結合，他們之間，本來就沒有相處相安的可能。至於琪恩的將來，馬龍諾佛爾深信琪恩將繼續從事於影戲事業。她將於兩年之内，重新嫁人，嫁後可以得到些微的快樂，這箇時候，恐怕琪恩就要脫離影戲事業了。</p>
<p>以上所說的三種預示，各有各的見解，我們不到將來，無從知道誰的預言是，誰的預言非。但是很奇怪的，他們有一件事，係衆口一詞的，就是琪恩哈羅將於兩年之内，重新嫁人還有一件事，是𨳐尼佛林同大理奥見解相同的，就是琪恩所嫁的人，大槪不是影業中的人物�</p>
<p>，但與影業至少有些關係。至於琪恩再嫁之後，能否得到快樂，卽就衆口異詞了。最好我們將他們三箇人的預言，記起來，到了兩年之後，看看應騐不應騐。</p>

<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>在近兩個月來，各戲院所映的片子，竟以滑稽片佔了絕大的優勢，這也可以看出美國影片的趨向了。</p>
<p>裴斯開登ＢusterKeaton自從有聲片盛行以後，他主演的，片子突然多了起來。老牌滑稽明星中，沒有人能和他比一比量數的。質的方面，也算不錯。如果你不信，可以看一看他最近演的「大學敎授」。SpeakEasily</p>
<p>本事是說一個大學敎授，因爲上了一個人的當，以爲他已發了財，就辭了職，打算到支加哥去。他到了一個小村中，在車站上和兩個旅客丨歌舞團員丨握手道别，不料火車却開走了。於是他不得已又找到那歌舞團中去，因爲他金錢上的揮霍，所以團中人都很巴結他。他也賞識了内中一個女優，兩方面的利用，於是他居然作了團主，带了所有的人，到百老匯表演去了。那時另有别的女優，也盡力籠絡他。以他如疾。如呆的態度，使表演成了極大的喜劇。同時他夢想中的巨欵居然也從天而降。八千尺的滑稽片，就在他和女優的一吻中結束了。</p>
<p>開登的表演極好。鐵板似的面孔，非常冷雋的態度，　大的舉動，都很討好。弄出大鼻子傑美JimmyDurante是第二次同他合作，笑的動因，却是正相反。傑美完全是嘻皮笑臉。配角方面有幾個男演員是很不錯，女演員就差事了，表演不免有過火處。</p>

<p>美國人對於中國民族的特性曾經說過，「中國人做生意，金錢不會用，所以不會賺，」的確，美國人的金錢眞會用，所以錢也眞會賺，即就影片一項而講，就很可看出這原則的不謬，和美國製片商的所以成功，中國製片商的所以失敗了，</p>
<p>本刋上拾肆日登的一片「『派拉蒙』之滬戰影片」裏說該公司因此共獲盈利二百四十餘萬，就是這個原則很好的證明</p>
<p>有人說，美國的影片是建在金圓上的，片子裏面有富麗的陳置，宏偉的佈景，熟練的演員，妖艶的女星，和牠們充分地發揮的紅唇白腿，和其餘一切的一切，雖然有許多人因此批評他，但美國的製片商却賺了許多錢，他們錢即眞會用，所以他們的錢也當然就會賺了，</p>
<p>回觀我們中國的製片商却不同了，他們不但不會用，並且不肯用，現在他們用雖肯用了，但却又不會用，就拿『明星』的『啼笑因緣』來講，一攝了六集，錢是肯用了，但因爲不會用，所以一集不如一集，假使『明星公司』當局是會用錢的話，那情形就不同了，一定要把他們攝六集所用去的錢，選「啼笑因緣」這本書裏，最有精彩，有意味的片段，或全書的精華，攝成一集，加以攝六集的演導，攝影和種種的精神放在一集上，那麽牠的成績一定就非常可觀，牠的錢也可以賺非常之多了，</p>

<p>「三個摩登女性」，眞不愧是一張摩登的片子。牠很顯明的說出來醇酒美人享樂消閒都是過去的丨落伍的丨摩登。拿潮流的，應當平民化，社會化。故事很平凡，導演術還很靈活，佈景亦堂皇，攝影光線都美，聯華出品中，（除去人道）這片子顯示出驚人的進步。</p>
<p>其中可說的就是對於勞工的寫實。一張摩登的片子，注重在都市生活的，而同時能顧到都市繁華的背面，這就是導演的成功，</p>
<p>這部片子，極合上中下各階級的口味。我希望摩登的青年們都去看一下，認一認清自身的地位，學一學什麽是呌人可敬可羨的「摩登」。</p>

According to a person from Chaoyang, on the 18th of this month, the Japanese army's Sanjian Zheng unit of Chaoyang Temple once attacked the Sanbaoyingzi in Nanling, but because our side's defense of Nanling was very strong, it did not succeed and withdrew to its original defense that night.

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese in the Northeast plan to implement five major poisonous schemes next year: 1. The puppet Central Bank will issue several million banknotes to collect cash and food from the Northeast, causing the Northeast economy to collapse and food shortages. 2. They will use heavy money to buy off Mongolian border bandits and Mongolian troops, and then gradually immigrate to Mongolia, and buy off and organize invading Mongolian troops, with training instructors and senior officers dispatched by the Japanese side. 3. Eliminate the volunteer army, starting with Heilongjiang, solving the Su Ma and other departments, and then moving on to Jilin and Liaoning, actively harming the volunteer army in various departments. 4. Armed immigration, starting from February of next year, will begin to move. The people who are moved must be fully armed, with a predetermined number of 300,000. 5. On the one hand, they will use heavy troops to contain Rehe, and on the other hand, they will implement the Manchu-Mongolian policy. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The envoys of various countries in Beiping, since Shigeru Yoshida's arrival in Ping, have been discussing how to deal with the new situation after the invasion of Rehe in various aspects and the Japanese army in Tianjin has been holding meetings for days. Japanese troops on the Fengshan and Jin-Chao lines have been arriving one after another, and trains fully loaded with military supplies arrive two or three times a day. Considering the above, a war between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Rehe is inevitable. The embassies of various countries stationed in Ping have also consulted several times on the issue of protecting their nationals. If the Japanese army invades Ping and Tianjin, they will organize a joint army to protect the Dongjiaominxiang. According to the news obtained by the diplomatic corps, the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe will occur before the League of Nations meeting on January 16. It is planned to occupy Minlu, Chifeng, Lingyuan, Chengde and other places on a large scale before the Lunar New Year, and at the same time attack Shanhaiguan and Pingjin, creating a new situation, making it impossible for the League of Nations to mediate, and using force to force the signing of a humiliating treaty. The generals in North China are deeply indignant at the brutality of the Japanese and have decided to defend their territory to the death and fight the Japanese to the last.

<h3 id="e15">The Japanese Army's Attack on Rehe is the Same Old Trick as the Shanghai War <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Success Means the Completion of a Delusion; Failure Means Seeking Another Way Out</p>
<p>We Should Devote All Our Strength to the Rehe Issue</p>
<p>The Soldiers Defending the Territory Bear the Most Important Responsibility</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter asked a certain authority about the tense situation in Rehe, asking whether the Japanese side was bluffing or would actually invade. Although he did not make a definitive judgment, he said that if the Japanese army invaded, the strategy adopted would be no different from the strategy of the Shanghai War on February 27 and 28. Moreover, the current situation is similar to that of the Shanghai War. On February 27 and 28, the former 19th Route Army bravely resisted. The Japanese army could neither win the war nor make peace. The Japanese army's expenses were huge, and there was widespread resentment, so Shirakawa sent heavy troops to attack Liuhang, making a desperate gamble. If successful, they would continue to advance; if defeated, they would seek another way out. Unfortunately, our reinforcements did not follow up, resulting in failure. The British ambassador's mediation was used to turn the tide. The intention of attacking Rehe this time is also the same. The Dong Province issue is being insisted on by both sides, and the issue of whether or not to recognize the puppet organization is deadlocked. For the past year, Japan has been facing extreme economic exhaustion due to huge military expenses, expenditures, and stagnation of export goods, making it difficult to maintain for long. When the League of Nations meets this time, Japan will collude with Britain to pressure us. Britain will also unite with Japan in order to delay its war debts to the United States. In the end, due to our firm stance and the efforts of various small countries to uphold justice, Britain's plan to delay its debts to the United States failed, and France even had its cabinet fall because of this. The Sino-Japanese dispute could not be resolved through further mediation. At this point, Japanese diplomacy was in a completely desperate situation. It attacked Rehe with all its strength, the same old trick as in Shanghai. If successful, the delusion of the four northeastern provinces would be completed, and there would be no need to negotiate with us diplomatically. If defeated, they would seek another way out. Therefore, we should devote all our strength to the Rehe issue. If we win due to resistance, the Japanese army will definitely collapse. Even if we unfortunately create a glorious failure, we can also find another way out diplomatically. In the future, will Rehe perish like the September 18th Incident, or will it be like the Shanghai War, where success was lost at the last moment, or will it be a major turning point in the life of our nation and country? The soldiers defending the territory bear the most important responsibility. (30th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain member of the Military Commission said that Japan's attempt to invade Rehe did not begin today. Judging from the various military actions on the Rehe border in the past six months, it is enough to see its intentions. Furthermore, such as the communique of the puppet organization, its orders are all issued to the four provinces, including Rehe. Its unwillingness to let go of Rehe is obvious. Recently, the Japanese side has used money to buy off ignorant and foolish people on the Rehe border, forging public opinion, colluding with bandits, and causing disturbances everywhere, using this as a pretext for invading Rehe. The reports from the various volunteer armies of the Beiping Military Sub-Committee and from Tokyo predict that the time of the outbreak will be around February. Its military plan is to attack Rehe on one side and invade Pingjin on the other. The Yangtze River area is also equipped with a substantial navy to contain it. It is difficult to predict at this time to what extent the future situation will expand. The telegrams from Rehe that this committee receives every day are immediately forwarded to Chairman Chiang for review. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

After Su Bingwen telegraphed Stalin and Wang Zensi, the secretary of the Chinese delegation, and other evidence, the important people of the Russian authorities admired Ma's character and treated Ma and Su with the same courtesy.

<p>(Beiping) The puppet state's finance minister Xi Qia recently secretly ordered the counties in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang to elect representatives to create a petition in the name of national public opinion, recommending the puppet governor Puyi as emperor, and drafted a persuasion letter, ordering the representatives to sign and seal it, intending to send it to Geneva for puppet state propaganda. When the representatives arrived in Changchun and presented the petition, the Japanese chief of the Shenyang police and puppet hall heard about it, and because the matter had not yet been formally initiated by the Japanese, he expelled the representatives. However, the Japanese are still secretly planning Puyi's restoration. The important officials of the puppet state's various organs are now being replaced by Japanese. Han traitors have no real power. The puppet prime minister Zheng Xiaoxu has been very negative recently. He once recommended Zang Shiyi to succeed him, but Zang declined. The puppet state's Minister of the Army Zhang Jinghui only lives with his two concubines in a newly opened hotel in Changchun, and he is respectful and respectful even when he sees a Japanese military policeman, for fear of offending the Japanese.

<p>(London) Chinese envoy to England, Guo Taiqi, told a Reuters interviewer today that after returning to Geneva next week, he will urge the League of Nations to immediately pass the Lytton Report, and especially focus on the deadline for the League of Nations General Assembly to accept the Lytton Committee's report. The dispute in the three northeastern provinces is no longer a purely Sino-Japanese issue, but a world issue involving the survival of the post-war peace system. If this system were to collapse, he feared that the 400 million Chinese people would have a reaction, and Chinese policy might have a new direction.</p>

Before his departure, he told people that there were no major battles ahead due to bad weather and that preparations were underway. Although Zhu and Mao's main force is still gathered in the Lichuan area, it is about to collapse. The bandits have seen through the bandits' fraudulent cruelty and are surrendering one after another.

<p>Shang Zhen Also Leaves Ping and Returns to Shunde</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 8:50 this morning, Han Fuju, accompanied by Jiang Bocheng, Shen Honglie, and others, returned to Jinan from Ping by special train. Han told reporters that our army in Rehe has had minor conflicts with the Japanese army from time to time, but not as serious as rumored. This time, the North China Political Committee has plans for resisting insults, but it is not yet convenient to announce them. My impression of this trip to Ping, both internally and externally, is very good. The generals of North China met in Beiping without prior arrangement, and they all shared the same hatred for the enemy and were determined to defend their territory. Compared with when I went to Ping in the summer, it was even more exciting, and because they were united externally and internally, it was even more solid. Therefore, the result was satisfactory. Director Zhang's attitude is also firm and his courage is great. Zhang was initially worried that the generals would have different opinions and had many concerns. Now that he sees that everyone is united and swears to defend their territory as his backing, he is relieved and more willing to go to the front and do it decisively. Mr. Feng, with his qualifications as a member of the Central Committee, can go to Beijing wherever he is, and Mr. Jiang will definitely welcome him. I don't know if he has any intention of leaving Zhang and going elsewhere. The defense of Yantai is currently maintained by the navy and is very calm. If land forces are needed in the future, I will send people there immediately. When I was in Ping, Director Zhang ordered the three armies to meet them. This matter can be discussed with Commander Shen, and it is not a problem. I am determined not to compete for the port. Shen Honglie said that Han is determined to send people to take over the defense of Yantai and Longkou. I will return to Qingdao tonight. Jiang Bocheng said that he came here to open a provincial representative conference and has no other task. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Deficit of More Than Two Million Taels</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Eastern Railway problem occurred, China has been in a surplus position in Sino-Russian trade for the past three years. According to the statistics of the Customs, the import amount in the 20th year was more than 22.72 million taels, and the export amount was more than 53.6 million taels, with a surplus of 30 million taels. However, since the outbreak of the January 28th Shanghai War this year, the boycott of Japanese goods in the country and the rapid influx of Soviet-Russian goods have resulted in a deficit of several hundred thousand taels after offsetting exports and imports in the last four months. After China and Russia announced the resumption of diplomatic relations, there have been great changes recently. Sino-Russian trade this year will turn from a surplus to a deficit.

<h3 id="e27">Seeing off the Old Year and Welcoming in the New. <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Time flies like an arrow. In the blink of an eye, there is only one day left of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Looking back on the past year, let us carefully examine the progress of our country's politics, the progress of our economy, and how much the vitality of our people has increased. The deeper the recognition, the more we cannot help but feel sadness, and the more urgent our inspiration.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident of the year before last, our country has been in a position of inferiority and defeat everywhere. We lost Shenyang and Jilin without a fight. When the enemy launched a sudden attack, we abandoned Jinzhou. Although China has vast lands, how many times can it withstand being divided and carved up? The only thing that can be comforting is that after the Shenyang Incident, the people had a slight motivation to improve, and the government also had the determination to make a fresh start with the people. The party and state elders also strongly advocated "spiritual solidarity to jointly face the national crisis." The previous disharmony was completely eliminated due to the great disaster. From then on, we could unite from top to bottom and the whole country could work together to face the national crisis. Who knew that the January 28th Incident would suddenly erupt in our armpit? Shanghai, the national center of finance and industry, was bombarded. Only the capital, Nanjing, was spared. The war lasted for thirty-two days. From the perspective of sorrow and depression, the prosperous area of Zhabei was reduced to scorched earth. The strategically important land of Wusong suddenly became a field of rubble. Considering only the tangible material losses in the Shanghai and Wusong area, it should be over 100 million yuan. And the spiritual losses, the cost of lives, and the indirect losses of all industries in the southeast region are not included. The loss of the Northeast is truly a national humiliation that our people will never forget. The bloodshed in Shanghai is an even deeper hatred that our nation will never forget for a hundred years. However, on the other hand, although our country has suffered unprecedented difficulties and is in a time when all industries are declining and the countryside is extremely exhausted, we can still barely support ourselves. With only a small force, we are facing the enemy of the entire country.</p>
<p>For more than a month of war, the general public exerted their spirit of diligence and hard work to assist the government, resist strong enemies from abroad, and suppress chaos from within. Although it was impossible to accomplish everything perfectly in such a short period of time, the national spirit has been fully demonstrated. Having understood the way to self-reliance and recovery, how can we count the achievements of one day for an ancient country with five thousand years of deep-rooted habits? Moreover, with a strong enemy in front and the national crisis being urgent, there are still areas that need to be cleaned up.</p>
<p>In today's world, it is not only our country that is loudly proclaiming national crisis. With the wealth of the United States of America, whether it is natural resources or human labor, it can be called the world's leader since the European War. However, since the economic panic occurred, it has gradually declined. In June 1931, President Hoover announced the postponement of indemnity and war debt payments, fully expecting that the world economy would have a turning point. However, a year and a half has passed, and the world economy has not improved. On the contrary, the situation in the United States has become even more panicked. Industrial manufactured goods are piled up like mountains. Wheat and cotton have also fallen to the lowest value required for production costs. Goods are congested and cannot be sold, while the number of unemployed has increased (to over ten million). Starving people are everywhere. Germany, with its tightly organized structure and strong spirit, is in an extremely difficult situation, both politically and economically, due to heavy oppression. The Brüning cabinet maintained the smooth operation of its national economy through emergency decrees. When Papen came to power, it was almost an absolute autocracy. Although he had dissolved the parliament, he could not win a majority of seats, surpassing the fascist movement of the Hitler Party. By the time General Schleicher formed a cabinet, combining the positions of Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, it was purely a military government. However, can the current economic difficulties of Germany be solved by military force? Over five million unemployed workers (according to a trade union survey, complete unemployment accounts for 47% of the 20.75 million workers). Is this kind of scene lighter than war? Among the European countries, France has the most stable economic situation. In fact, its peak of prosperity came later than other countries, so its decline is also later. Moreover, it has received a large amount of indemnity. Since last year, although it has tried its best to increase tariff barriers, import trade has decreased as a result, and export trade has also decreased by more than 30% compared to last year. The number of unemployed workers has suddenly increased to 340,000. The national treasury expenditure has increased by 50% compared to 1926. Therefore, France, which has abundant gold reserves and ranks second in the world, still has its economic crisis continuing. Britain was originally the leader of capitalist countries. Since the autumn of last year, it has abandoned its gold standard and willingly relinquished its financial throne, using inflation policies to maintain its declining economy. An advanced constitutional country has even deviated from the normal path of constitutionalism and organized a national unity cabinet to deal with its extraordinary (national crisis). 2.92 million unemployed people are still unable to find employment. Japan believes that its military sword can conquer everything and that military victory can eliminate the current predicament. It does not know that increased military spending is the only obstacle to the recovery of the market. If China refuses to yield, then Japan's so-called national crisis will never be resolved.</p>
<p>Looking around the world today, small countries aside, all are collapsing on the road to bankruptcy. Even the so-called six major powers are all in the midst of crisis. All are exerting their full strength, either based on their own country, such as the British Empire's economic alliance, or with the goal of expanding territory, such as Japan's invasion of our country. But the one thing they have in common is the whole country going crazy to face the national crisis.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, from the September 18th Incident to the January 28th Incident, the people of our country were under the oppression of a strong enemy's violence, but they were still able to help themselves with great effort, seize the opportunity to rise up, and suddenly there was a new atmosphere of China's recovery. How long has it been? The crisis in front of us remains the same. The three northeastern provinces have fallen into the hands of the enemy. The wounds of the Shanghai war have not yet healed. The enemy's troops are flaunting their power in our country. And the general public, after a period of relaxation (the countryside has seen a slight harvest, but industry and commerce are trapped in the cities), are turning a blind eye to the current crisis, singing and dancing, drunk and dreaming, only seeking momentary pleasure and happiness, waiting for the enemy to perish on their own, and ignoring the fall of the Northeast. They have no regard for the future of the nation and the country. They do not even know to be vigilant when danger is at hand. What is even worse is that they are not satisfied with harming themselves, but instead blame the local area, inflict disasters on the people, and give the enemy an excuse to laugh at friendly countries, leaving shame for the world and putting the country in danger. Therefore, those who love us stand by and watch, those who hate us kick us when we are down, and those who hate us even wield the knife to cut us.</p>
<p>From the publication of the League of Nations' investigation report to the meeting of the League of Nations' Administrative Council, in these three months, looking at our country, the conflict between Han Fuju and Liu Zhennian was fortunately quelled, but the fighting between the two Lius in Sichuan even involved the use of land, sea, and air forces. The innocent people of Sichuan had to endure the cruel disaster as if they were in an enemy country. Before the Sichuan war was over, there was the struggle between the Qian army and You Guocai. Even Guizhou, which is as barren and bitter as Guizhou, could not avoid repeated military disasters. The hard-working farmers who are loyal to their work, even if they use all their strength, can hardly get a moment of peace. The Yangtze River Delta area suffered from floods last year, and the houses were empty. This spring, they suddenly heard about the Shanghai war and were terrified. The autumn harvest was once again a disaster due to cheap grain. Life is as thin as a thread. What we rely on for support is the historical virtue of perseverance and hard work of our people to prop up this precarious situation. Therefore, the enemy country is trying every means to bully us and mocking us in every way. They even say that our country is an unorganized country. Their intention is to imply to the powers from the root that "China has not yet formed a modern country, so it can be taken at will." They are also strengthening their military preparations. During the League of Nations' General Assembly, they also used the name of troop rotation to transfer the Kumamoto 6th Division to the Jinzhou and Yi County area, preparing to take the opportunity to invade Rehe and seize Shanhaiguan. The international alliance that advocates peace is not only influenced by the two major powers of Britain and France to maintain the balance of power in Europe, but is now also deliberately accommodating Japan, implementing delays and watching, allowing the peace of East Asia to be shattered under the iron hooves of Japanese militarism.</p>
<p>From now on, the Eastern market will lose its balance. The roots of war are being planted deeper and deeper. The war-mongering Japanese warlords are wielding their military swords and criticizing peace, even wanting to settle accounts with our country.</p>
<p>Our country is in this dangerous environment and is facing an incomparably strong and stubborn enemy. We must rise up and fight in time, fight flesh and blood, and work together to win the final victory against the enemy. Although our strength is weak, if we do our best to fight Japan, the final victory will surely belong to "the one who is grieved." On this New Year's Eve, I hope that the people of the country will strive to encourage themselves. "All things of the past are like yesterday's death. All things of the future are like today's birth!"</p>

<p>Remarks by Researchers at the Academia Sinica</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The earthquake in Gansu this time was extremely severe. According to a researcher at the Meteorological Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, the Gansu earthquake occurred at 10:08:54 AM on the 25th of this month. Nanjing felt the tremor four minutes after the earthquake occurred. The epicenter was in the Tianshan Mountains. The cause of the earthquake was the fault structure of the mountains. Therefore, the duration of the earthquake was more than two hours. Its severity even broke earthquake records, surpassing the tragedies of the Xinjiang-Gansu earthquakes in 1920 and 1927. The radius of the ground rupture was about 20 Chinese miles. Suzhou suffered heavy losses due to the impact of the epicenter wave. Other areas around the epicenter, such as Lanzhou, Qinghai, Mongolia, and Sichuan, were also affected by aftershocks. In addition to notifying the meteorological observatories in Shanghai, Beiping, Soviet Russia, the Dutch East Indies, and India, the Meteorological Research Institute is also paying attention to reporting to each other. Furthermore, since the earthquake occurred in Xinjiang in the northwest last year, and this year it has moved east and west to Gansu, another earthquake has occurred. The cause will be carefully studied in the future. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) After He Chengjun arrived in Xi'an, plans to suppress the remaining bandits have been agreed upon. Yang Hucheng has been appointed as commander-in-chief. Yang flew to Hanzhong on the 30th. It is heard that the remaining bandits have again dispersed and fled towards northern Sichuan. Our divisions under Liu Maoen, Xiao Zhichu, and Hu Zongnan are still pursuing them. The Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei armies have decided to encircle and suppress them immediately, so as to eliminate them in one fell swoop. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun telegraphed the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters on the 29th that the Xu bandits were defeated in southern Shaanxi and seemed to be fleeing to the border of Sichuan. The National Army is blocking them in the Shiquan and Ziyang area. The future of bandit suppression is optimistic. He will return to Hankou in about ten days. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to military sources, most of Xu bandits' remnants have fled into the northern part of Tongjiang and Nanjiang counties in northern Sichuan, near Yusi Pass. The main force is in Nanjiang and seems to be attempting to flee to Gansu. Tian Songyao and Liu Cunhou have separately sent troops to suppress them. It is heard that He Long has already crossed the Yangtze River to the south bank in the Badong area on the Hubei border. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that the size of our country's provinces is larger than that of a single European or American country, which is a major reason why politics is not easy to advance. The cultivation of warlords in the past was also conceived from this. Therefore, there are already many people who advocate reducing the number of provinces. Since the proposal was put forward and passed by member Wu Chao-shu at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang two years ago, it has aroused the attention of the people of the country and many have expressed their support. However, given the current situation, it is a difficult issue to implement. But the first step in this matter is to investigate the population, geography, economy, customs, transportation, etc. of each province, and at the same time solicit the opinions of experts, and then formulate detailed methods. As for the recruitment of talents for investigation, it is another major difficulty. It must take a long time to succeed. Moreover, Shi Ying proposed to change the provincial system, so that from now on, the powers will be concentrated in the hands of the governor. Judging from the past and present, if a governor does not have military power, can he fully exercise his duties? If he has military power, can he avoid repeating the abuses of military personnel governing in the past? In the future, if the number of provinces can be reduced and the provincial system can be changed, it will be most appropriate. The implementation of the above two plans must be complementary. The Central Political Council will first send them to the Economic and Legal Systems Groups to review them together, and then submit them to the Standing Committee for discussion to determine the principles and make practical preparations. If we want to implement them at the beginning of the constitutional government, we must proceed quickly at this time. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Advocating for the U.S. to Permanently Retain Naval and Military Powers</p>
<p>Filipinos Rejoice and the Entire Nation is Ecstatic</p>
<p>Manila, 29th (National News Agency): Today is the 36th anniversary of the martyrdom of Philippine independence fighter José Rizal. It is a legal holiday in the Philippines, and all sectors are taking a day off. The news of the U.S. Congress passing the independence bill has arrived here, making Filipinos even more joyful and the entire nation ecstatic. A large number of Manila citizens participated in a parade, departing from Rizal Street at 3 p.m., circling the entire city, and arriving at the Rizal Monument in Luneta Park in the evening for a grand review and speeches about Rizal's deeds before dispersing. Parades were also held throughout the island, with beauty pageants held in advance to select the most beautiful girl as the Rizal Day Queen, serving as the leader of the parade on this day. The participants competed in colorful and strange costumes to add to the parade's splendor. Apart from grand prayers held in various churches, the original intent of mourning had long been lost, turning into a festival of entertainment. However, today, as the freedom for which Rizal fought throughout his life is about to be realized, everyone feels joyful. Rizal was one of the greatest figures in the Philippines, also being a doctor, philanthropist, social reformer, poet, writer, and linguist. Although he advocated for peaceful reform throughout his life, the Spanish military authorities accused him of inciting revolution and brutally executed him by firing squad in Bagumbayan at 6 a.m. 36 years ago.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas): The draft law regarding the autonomy of the Philippine Islands was recently passed by the House of Representatives, stipulating that autonomous rights be granted to the Philippines after ten years.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (National News Agency): The U.S. House of Representatives debated this bill for only one hour before passing it today, which is rare. This indicates that even if the bill is vetoed by President Hoover, there will still be enough votes to pass it again. Although there has been no record-breaking vote in the Senate, it is said that before the vote, no more than fifteen people actually opposed independence. It is expected that if a second vote is needed in the future, it may not be impossible to obtain the required two-thirds majority. The bill will now be signed by the Speaker of the House, Garner, and sent back to the Senate. After being signed by the President of the Senate, Vice President Curtis, it will be sent to the President. Hoover is currently out of the capital for fishing, and will likely return to the capital within the next week. According to the Constitution, he has several days to consider before either approving or rejecting it. However, even after the President approves it, the bill must be passed by the Philippine Legislative Assembly or Constitutional Convention before it takes effect.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (Reuters): According to the compromise reached by the House of Representatives on the Philippine Independence Bill today, the joint committee of both houses drafted it. In addition to the independence clauses, it also contains milder restrictions on immigration and trade than before, and includes provisions advocating that the United States should permanently retain full naval and military power in the Philippines, and requesting the President to negotiate a treaty with foreign governments recognizing the Philippines' permanent neutrality upon its independence.</p>
<p>Manila, 30th (National News Agency): Philippine Senate President Quezon, a leader of the independence movement, assured today that the independence bill passed by the U.S. Congress, although containing some unsatisfactory provisions, can be accepted by the Philippines. He stated that considering the current situation in Washington, the bill may already be considered the best possible option. However, he intends to cable his representative in Washington to explain this situation, and that he personally will approach this bill with a very open mind, and will provide a detailed commentary after thorough study.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 30th (China United News Agency): Yesterday, in the New York exchange market, the Japanese exchange rate fell another nineteen cents, closing at 20.81 cents. According to Japanese speculators, the exchange rate against foreign currencies will fall again in a month. They cited five reasons: (1) The Japanese fiscal future is becoming more pessimistic. During the ongoing congressional session, the shortcomings of Japanese finance will inevitably be gradually exposed to the world financial community, causing a decline in Japan's credit. (2) The control of the Dalian clique is ineffective. (3) The situation in the League of Nations remains sluggish, and the future is extremely worrying. (4) The military offensive against Jehol will begin in mid-January. If this war again provokes public outrage from world opinion, the situation will become unmanageable. (5) Japan's foreign trade has entered a period of excess imports. With the above reasons, the financial community in the new year will have difficulty recovering. Although military industries may slightly recover, the remaining foreign exchange from the reactionary boom, falling prices, and high prices will plunge the opinions of the working and peasant classes into poverty.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (China United News Agency): According to a report by the Bank of Japan, the gold notes issued today reached 1,455,306,000 yuan, which is 29,992,000 yuan more than the previous record in 1916, and 74,140,000 yuan more than the same period last year. It can be said to be a new record since the founding of Japan. Its cash reserve of 425,068,000 yuan is only 29 percent.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Spanish Revolutionary Party's Conspiracy to Revolt Exposed <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Barcelona, 30th (National News Agency): The three parts of the Spanish Revolutionary Party, namely the Industrial Revolutionary Party, the Anarchist Party, and the Communist Party, have recently abandoned their differences and conspired to revolt together. Fortunately, a bomb exploded in the old ammunition depot of party members in Barcelona, ​​which attracted the attention of the police, who seized a large amount of military equipment, such as bombs, hand grenades, rifles, pistols, and bullets, as well as many secret documents, and learned the location of arsenals and bomb depots throughout the city and elsewhere. The police authorities immediately went to each location and seized them with lightning speed. The party's plan was to take advantage of the public celebrating the New Year to distribute military equipment on Sunday morning, and agree to start the revolt at 10 a.m. Railway workers would also go on strike at that time to obstruct the movement of troops, because the party leaders knew that the garrison in Barcelona would be easily subdued if they could not get outside support. The party also relied on a part of the military to rebel against the government, because there were several officers on the roster. Fortunately, the discovery was made early, otherwise, it would have been difficult to manage.</p>

<p>The Warning of the British Labour Party Newspaper</p>
<p>Those Who Promote Japanese Arrogance Should Bear Full Responsibility</p>
<p>London, 30th (Reuters): The diplomatic correspondent of the Labour Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, published an article on the front page entitled "Japan Prepares to Seize Peiping," stating that the Japanese warlords are currently gathering troops in South Manchuria, planning to invade Jehol, with the ultimate goal of continuing south to occupy Peiping, declaring all of North China an independent country, and supporting Puyi to ascend the throne as a puppet emperor. At that time, China will no longer remain silent and will inevitably resist with arms, and a real war will begin from then on. Those who bear most of the responsibility for this war will be those who have now tacitly approved Japan's actions, causing its arrogance to grow daily.</p>

<p>Washington, 29th (Havas): Secretary of State Stimson formally notified French Ambassador to the United States Claudel that U.S.-French trade negotiations have completely stopped. Regarding this matter, Under Secretary of State Castle made a correction, saying that the trade negotiations have not stopped, but only been temporarily suspended. Stimson and Claudel never discussed the U.S.-France trade agreement. President Hoover is about to leave office, and regarding international issues, he cannot take any measures in fact without first obtaining the consent of the new President Roosevelt. Roosevelt's views are completely different from Hoover's, especially regarding trade agreements and tariff issues. For example, Roosevelt advocates for reducing tariff rates, while Hoover advocates for raising them. Their opinions differ so much that Roosevelt, in order to preserve his freedom to negotiate after taking office, is unwilling to intervene in political affairs at this time.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Indictment of Chen Duxiu Case <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Indictment from the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office</p>
<p>Chen and Ten Others Accused of Endangering the Republic of China</p>
<p>After Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, and others were escorted to Nanjing, the Ministry of Justice instructed the Jiangsu High Court to handle the case according to the law. Prosecutor Zhu went to Nanjing for investigation, which has now concluded. Except for Wang Xiaochun, for whom no substantial evidence was found and who will not be prosecuted, Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Wang Wu, Pu Yifan, Wang Ziping, He Afang, Wang Zhaoqun, Guo Jinghao, Liang Youguang, and Wang Jiantang, a total of ten people, are deemed to have committed crimes endangering the Republic of China based on conclusive evidence and should be held criminally responsible. A public prosecution was filed with the Criminal Division of the same court the day before yesterday. As soon as President Lin returns to Suzhou (Lin is currently in Zhenjiang reporting on his work at the Jiangsu Provincial Representative Assembly), he will appoint a presiding judge to go to Nanjing to conduct the trial. The indictment of Prosecutor Zhu is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Defendants Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi (also known as Zhang Cinan), Wang Wu (also known as Song Fengchun), Pu Yifan, Wang Yuping, He Afang, Wang Zhaoqun, Guo Jinghao (also known as Peng Daozhi), Liang Youguang, and Wang Jiantang, the above ten defendants, are all in custody. The above-mentioned defendants are involved in Case No. 38, Criminal Character, of the Republic of China, which endangers the Republic of China. The investigation has been completed, and it is deemed that a public prosecution should be filed. The criminal facts of the defendants and the articles of law violated are listed below:</p>
<p>In October of this year, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau received a tip that a counterfeit central organ of the Communist Party was located on the upper floor of No. 210 Chunyang Lane, Dongyouheng Road, in the Shanghai International Settlement. Inspector Tang Bao and Zhang Qingtai were secretly dispatched with a letter to the First Special District Court to issue a search and arrest warrant. They, along with Western Detective Gode and Western Detective Clerk Laosilai of the police station, went to the address at 3:00 PM on the 15th of the same month. Xie Shaoshan and the defendants Pu Yifan, Peng Shuzhi (also known as Zhang Cinan), Wang Wu (also known as Song Fengchun), and Wang Zhaoqun, five people in total, were holding their weekly meeting and were arrested together. A large number of reactionary documents were seized on the spot, along with several scraps of paper with communication addresses. Based on these addresses, detectives went to the upper floor of No. 11 Yongyu Lane, Yuezhou Road, at 7:00 PM on the same day and arrested the defendant Chen Duxiu, seizing a large number of reactionary documents. At around 9:00 PM, they searched Pu Yifan's residence at No. 322 Gaofu Lane, Shengmuyuan Road, and seized various reactionary documents, and also arrested Wang Xiaochun. At around 12:00 AM that night (the 16th, 0:00 AM), they went to No. 1044 Siwen Lane, Datong Road. Because it was late at night, the door was knocked on, and the people inside were frightened by the noise. Two people jumped out of the window, one escaped, and only the defendant Liang Youguang was arrested, and several reactionary documents were seized. At 7:30 AM, they went to the lower floor of No. 335 Yeguang Lane, Tangshan Road, where the defendants Wang Ziping and He Afang were printing communist publications "Spark" and "School Life," and they were arrested along with the evidence. At 12:00 PM, they went to No. 20 Fuli Lane and arrested the defendant Wang Jiantang, seizing ten types of reactionary books. Previously, after the detectives arrested Wang Ziping and others in the house at No. 335 Yeguang Lane, Tangshan Road, they immediately dispatched people to guard it secretly. On the 17th, the defendant Guo Jinghao (also known as Peng QiuZhi), unaware that the matter had been exposed, went to the house and was also arrested by the guarding police officers. They were then escorted to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and handed over to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to be brought back. First, Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi were transferred to the Military Law Department of the Army Headquarters of the Ministry of Military Administration. After questioning, it was determined that they were not related to the communist bandits in Hubei and Jiangxi, and Chen Duxiu and others were not active military personnel. Moreover, the location of the crime did not comply with the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 7 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. It was deemed that they had no jurisdiction and were transferred to this office by the Ministry of Justice for handling according to the law. This office collected the case files and interrogated them repeatedly. Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, and others admitted to joining the Communist Party, establishing the Left Opposition faction of the Chinese Communist Party, and being elected as members of the Central Publications Committee. During the investigation, it was discovered that the police of the Shanghai International Settlement had seized more than 40 types of reactionary documents in Chen Duxiu's home. Staff members were dispatched to the Central Party Headquarters to collect all the documents and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau subsequently delivered the accomplices Wang Wu (also known as Song Fengchun), Pu Yifan, Wang Ziping, He Afang, Wang Zhaoqun, Guo Jinghao, Liang Youguang, and Wang Jiantang, a total of nine people, to this office for joint trial. As a result of the investigation, except for Wang Xiaochun, for whom no substantial evidence was found and who will not be prosecuted, the criminal acts of Chen Duxiu and the other nine defendants should be discussed separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Chen Duxiu's Part: The defendant Chen Duxiu is from Huaining, Anhui. He initially studied at Tokyo University in Japan. He returned to China briefly during the first and second years of Xuantong in the Qing Dynasty (1909-1910) to engage in writing. After the restoration, he went to Japan again to continue his studies. In the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915), he returned to China and went to Shanghai, where he served as the editor of the Youth Magazine, aiming to oppose religion, warlords, and Confucianism. In the fifth year of the Republic of China (1916), he went to Peking University as the dean of the Faculty of Arts until the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920), when he returned to Shanghai to run the Youth Magazine. In the same year, he joined the Communist Party. He then went to Guangdong to serve as the Director of Education for about a year. He returned to Shanghai due to illness. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), he went to Moscow and stayed for about two months. After returning to China, he was appointed as the General Secretary of the Communist Party, directly receiving orders from Moscow and directing the activities of the Communist Party in various places. Until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), due to the Kuomintang's purge of the Communists and the failure of the Communist Party, the Third International dismissed him from his position as General Secretary, claiming he was ineffective in performing his duties. At that time, the Communist Party internally split into two factions: (1) the Stalin faction, also known as the Cadre faction; (2) the Trotsky faction. The defendant leaned towards the Trotsky faction and disagreed with the Cadre faction. By the second half of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), he was expelled from the party. Thereupon, the defendant gathered a group of expelled individuals, such as Peng Shuzhi, Wang Ziping, and Song Fengchun, and organized the Left Opposition faction of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai. The defendant and Peng Shuzhi and Zhang Jiu were elected as members of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, and Song Fengchun and Pu Yifan were elected as alternate members of the Standing Committee. They also established branches in Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places to carry out activities separately. Due to limited funding, they only participated in labor unions and student movements, and because there were fewer party members in the farmers' associations, they could not expand. The party's publications included "School Life" and "Spark," both of which were edited by the defendant. All of the above facts were confessed by the defendant in the police station, the Second Branch of the High Court, and this office, and are consistent with the confessions of the accomplice Peng Shuzhi and others. The defendant is the chief of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Left Opposition faction of the Chinese Communist Party (hereinafter referred to as the CCP Opposition), and is the mastermind of a party. He should be responsible for his personal actions and the reactionary documents he published. Moreover, he should be fully responsible for the reactionary leaflets and manifestos published in the name of the CCP Opposition and the actions he directed. After reviewing the "Political Resolution on the Current Situation and Our Tasks" published in the name of the CCP Opposition (Evidence No. 24), the "Appeal to the People on the Seventh Anniversary of the May Thirtieth Movement" (Evidence No. 5), the "Declaration on the Current Situation" (Evidence No. 6), the "Notice of the Organizational Committee" (Evidence No. 10), the "Appeal to the People on the Japanese Imperialists' Recent Attack on Shanghai" (Evidence No. 11), the "Appeal to the People of the Whole Country on the Japanese Occupation of Shanghai" (Evidence No. 15), the "Appeal to the People by the Committee of the Eastern District of Shanghai on the Japanese Massacre in Shanghai" (Evidence No. 16), the "Appeal to the People of the Whole Country on the Japanese Occupation of Shanghai" (Evidence No. 20), and the "Recent Work Plan of the Beijing Special Committee" (Evidence No. 323), on the one hand, they used diplomacy as a pretext to vigorously promote communism; on the other hand, they coldly ridiculed and wantonly attacked the Kuomintang government. In essence, they claimed that the Kuomintang government's credibility had fallen to the ground and it could not lead the masses. They should lead the farmers, workers, and proletariat in armed uprisings, organize peasant-worker armies, establish a Soviet regime, overthrow the National Government, and implement a proletarian dictatorship, and wanted to overthrow capitalists, confiscate land, and distribute it to poor peasants. Their words were contradictory, obviously intending to destroy China's economic and political organization. The "Where is China Going?" (Evidence No. 26), "This is the Broad Road of the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Movement" (Evidence No. 26), "The Situation After the Second Resolution of the League of Nations" (Evidence No. 26), and "Appeal to Workers in Commemoration of May Day" (Evidence No. 26) published in his personal name, even regarded the Three Principles of the People as reactionary and advocated a third revolution, resolutely sweeping away the Kuomintang government and replacing the Kuomintang regime with a revolutionary people's regime. His intention to endanger the Republic of China is obvious. However, upon investigation of the procedures followed by the Communist Party, which originally included stages such as organizing groups, propagating doctrines, armed uprisings, and establishing a Soviet regime, it is observed that the defendant's actions only involved the propagation of communism and had not yet reached the stage of an uprising. However, with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, he assembled and organized groups, and used written materials to engage in treasonous propaganda, which is conclusively proven. He should be held responsible.</p>
<p>(2) Peng Shuzhi's Part: The defendant Peng Shuzhi, also known as Zhang Cinan, is from Baoqing, Hunan. He graduated from Baoqing Middle School. In the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), he joined the Communist Party in Changsha. In the same year, he went to Moscow to study. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), he returned to China and served as a mathematics teacher at Shanghai University and was in charge of editing the New Youth Monthly and Guide Weekly. Until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), when the Kuomintang purged the Communists and the Communist Party split, the defendant leaned towards the Trotsky faction. Due to differences in strategy, he was expelled from the party by the Cadre faction. In the second half of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), he joined Chen Duxiu in forming the Left Opposition faction of the Chinese Communist Party and was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee. On October 15 of this year, using the pseudonym Zhang Cinan, he was holding a weekly meeting at Xie Shaoshan's house with Pu Yifan, Wang Wu, Wang Zhaoqun, and others when he was arrested on the spot. The defendant is a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the CCP Opposition (hereinafter referred to as the CCP Standing Committee) and is one of the masterminds of the party. He should be fully responsible for the reactionary propaganda documents published in the name of the party and the activities he directed. The reasoning is the same as for Chen Duxiu. The reactionary documents he personally published, such as "The Japanese Imperialists' Forcible Occupation of the Three Northeastern Provinces and the Ruling Class's Kuomintang" (Evidence No. 26), "The Meaning of National Unity Against Foreign Aggression" (Evidence No. 26), "The Stalinists' Assessment of the Manchurian Incident and the Crisis of the Anti-Japanese Movement" (Evidence No. 26), "The Lessons of the Shanghai Incident and its Future" (Evidence No. 26), and "The Lessons of One Year of the Manchurian Incident and the Awareness That the People Should Have" (Evidence No. 26), upon reading their content, all promote communism and even slander the Kuomintang as a running dog of imperialism. After examining its purpose and strategies, it is determined that it aims to endanger the Republic of China. However, it has not yet reached the stage of an uprising. His acts of using written materials for treasonous propaganda and assembling and organizing groups should be held equally responsible with Chen Duxiu.</p>
<p>(3) Wang Wu's Part: The defendant Wang Wu, originally named Song Fengchun, joined the Communist Party in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China (1925) through the introduction of Zuo Jun and was in charge of propaganda work. Later, he disagreed with the Cadre faction and was expelled from the party. He then joined the Trotsky faction. In May of last year, using the pseudonym Liu Menggeng, he organized a Communist Party organ with Zheng Chaolin. The Songhu Garrison Command discovered this and, together with the police, arrested the defendant. The Shanghai Provisional Military Tribunal sentenced him to six years in prison and sent him to the Second Jiangsu Prison to serve his sentence. Later, the defendant contracted a disease in prison and was approved for medical parole on October 5 of this year. He did not repent and continued to carry out Communist Party work and was elected as an alternate member of the CCP Standing Committee. On October 15, he attended a Communist Party meeting with Peng Shuzhi and others and was arrested along with them when the detectives arrived. The defendant has clearly admitted to joining the Communist Party and being responsible for propaganda work. Although the defendant does not admit to being promoted to an alternate member of the CCP Standing Committee and attending Communist Party meetings after being released on medical parole, the accomplice Xie Shaoshan stated in the police station and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court (hereinafter referred to as the Second Branch of the High Court) that there were five members of the Standing Committee, namely Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Pu Yifan, Luo Shifan, and Song Fengchun. The last person had just been released from the Caohejing prison and this was his first time attending a meeting. I was arrested on the day we were holding our weekly meeting, etc. (pages 21 and 46 of the Second Branch of the High Court volume). Peng Shuzhi and Chen Duxiu also stated that the defendant was an alternate member of the Standing Committee (pages 51 and 52 of Volume 2 of this office), which is consistent with Xie Shaoshan's testimony. It is conclusively proven that the defendant attended the meeting and was elected as an alternate member of the CCP Standing Committee, and he cannot deny it. Moreover, while carrying out a crime, he committed the same crime again, and the circumstances are more serious. It is requested that he be severely punished.</p>
<p>(4) Pu Yifan's Part: The defendant Pu Yifan firmly denies joining the Communist Party and being elected as an alternate member of the Standing Committee. However, he was arrested while attending a weekly meeting at Xie Shaoshan's house, and reactionary books were found in his residence at No. 322 Gaofu Lane, Shengmuyuan Road. The accomplice Xie Shaoshan stated that the Standing Committee included five members: Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Song Fengchun, and Pu Yifan (also known as Bu Deze), etc. (page 21 of the Second Branch of the High Court volume). When the judge of the Second Branch of the High Court asked what Peng Shuzhi's position was, she replied that he was a member of the Standing Committee. When asked about Pu Yifan and Wang Wu, she replied that they were also members of the Standing Committee (page 46 of the Second Branch of the High Court volume). Chen Duxiu stated in this office that there were three members of the Standing Committee. Besides me and Peng Shuzhi and Zhang Jiu, Pu Yifan and Song Fengchun were both alternate members of the Standing Committee (page 51 of Volume 2 of this office). The accomplice Peng Shuzhi, when asked in this office about Xie Shaoshan's statement that there were five members of the Standing Committee, replied that two were alternate members of the Standing Committee. When asked who the alternate members of the Standing Committee were, he said Song Fengchun and Pu Yifan (page 52 of Volume 2 of this office). Taking all of the above into consideration, it is highly credible that the defendant is an alternate member of the Standing Committee of the CCP Opposition. Moreover, the defendant was arrested on the spot while attending a meeting. If he were not a member of the Standing Committee, how could he participate? It is beyond doubt that the defendant joined a group assembled to endanger the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(5) Wang Ziping's Part: The defendant Wang Ziping, also known as Zeng Meng, is from Wenzhou, Zhejiang. In the twelfth or thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he went to Guangdong to apply for the Whampoa Military Academy but failed. Through a friend's introduction, he served as a clerk at the academy and then transferred to the Guangzhou General Labor Union, where he worked as a secretary. He resigned due to low pay and drifted around Guangzhou for several years. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), through the introduction of his friend Qin Dingyu, he became a proofreader at the Chongwentang Printing House on Jiangwan Road in Shanghai. He joined the Communist Party at the persuasion of Hao Qianzhi, the deputy manager of Chongwentang. In October of the same year, he was sent to Moscow to study at Sun Yat-sen University. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, he returned to China due to illness and became involved with the Left Opposition faction. He was expelled from the party by the Cadre faction and joined the Trotsky faction. He was responsible for copying, printing, and distributing propaganda documents for the party. When he was arrested, the defendant was printing "School Life" and "Spark," claiming that the party instructed him to print 100 copies of "School Life" and 250 copies of "Spark." Given his actions, he joined a Communist Party organization and helped to spread communist propaganda. He has confessed to this without dispute and should be held criminally responsible.</p>
<p>(6) He Afang's Part: The defendant He Afang, also known as He Fang and He Zhi, is from Ruian, Zhejiang. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, he arrived in Shanghai. In February of the sixteenth year, he joined the Communist Party organization through the introduction of his friend Jin Muhun, also known as Jin Shisheng, and served as a messenger, receiving 25 yuan a month. In September of the sixteenth year, he was sent to the Eastern University and Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow to study communism for about three years. After graduating, he worked as a coppersmith in a red factory for about half a year and was expelled from the country. In April of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, he returned to Shanghai and worked as a coppersmith in factories such as Zhuoqun Machinery. He then joined the Trotsky faction. On September 23 of this year, he moved to the lower floor of No. 335 Yeguang Lane, Tangshan Road, and jointly printed reactionary publications, leaflets, and other documents of the CCP Opposition with Wang Ziping. All of the above facts have been stated in detail by the defendant in the police station, the Second Branch of the High Court, the Public Security Bureau, and this office. When he was arrested, he was engaged in printing work, and a large number of reactionary documents such as "Spark" and "School Life" were seized on the spot, which is consistent with his confession. The defendant joined the Communist Party organization and helped to spread communist propaganda. The evidence and testimonies are solid and conclusive and should be prosecuted according to the law.</p>
<p>(7) Wang Zhaoqun's Part: According to the defendant Wang Zhaoqun, he is from Suxian, Anhui. In October of this year, through the introduction of his friend Li Sichang, he was instructed to go to Shanghai to find Xie Shaoshan for work and stayed at Xie Shaoshan's home. He was arrested together with Peng Shuzhi and others on October 15 and firmly denies joining the Communist Party. Xie Shaoshan's home was the central organ of the Communist Party and was often used for meetings and discussions, which Xie Shaoshan has repeatedly stated clearly. Moreover, the Communist Party is a secret organization, and its meeting places are extremely strict. It does not allow outsiders to be present. Furthermore, he was arrested while a meeting was in progress. If the defendant did not have any qualifications, why would he be allowed to attend and participate? Since he was arrested on the spot, there is no doubt that he is a communist who joined a group and attended meetings.</p>
<p>(8) Guo Jinghao's Part: Guo Jinghao is Peng Shuzhi's younger brother and his original name was Peng Daozhi. There is a Communist Party school registration form to prove this (page 66 of Volume 2 of this office). According to the registration form, the defendant is currently 23 years old. In September of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China (1925), he joined the Communist Party in Changsha, Hunan. He later withdrew from the relationship in an informal way. In December of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), he joined the Opposition in Shanghai. He had previously engaged in student movements. After joining the Opposition, he was engaged in the district committee and student movements in the eastern district of Shanghai and is currently responsible for organizational committee work and student movements. According to this record, the defendant is highly suspected of joining a Communist Party organization.</p>
<p>(9) Liang Youguang's Part: On October 15 of this year, after the Communist Party's central organ in Chunyang Lane, Dongyouheng Road, was cracked down, several scraps of paper with communication addresses were seized. Based on these addresses, the detectives went to ambush No. 1044 Siwen Lane, Datong Road. Because it was late at night, the defendant and others were nervous due to their guilt. Another person escaped by jumping out of the window, but the defendant Liang Youguang was chased and captured after jumping out of the window and running for more than ten steps (page 44 of the Second Branch of the High Court volume). Various reactionary books were seized in the house. When questioned, the defendant firmly claimed that the reactionary books did not belong to him. However, since the defendant is not a member of the Communist Party, he should have sat quietly in the room and waited for the search. Why would he be so panicked? The Shanghai Public Security Bureau has verified that the defendant is an inspector of the CCP Opposition in various provinces and had just arrived in Shanghai from Guangxi. There is an official letter from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to prove this (page 64 of Volume 2 of this office). There is considerable evidence that the defendant is a member of the Communist Party. His claim that he was looking for his younger brother Liang Youming is obviously an excuse and cannot be believed.</p>
<p>(10) Wang Jiantang's Part: The defendant Wang Jiantang repeatedly denied participating in Communist Party work when questioned. After reviewing the files of the Second Branch of the High Court, it was found that the detectives went to arrest him based on the communication address scraps seized at Xie Shaoshan's house, and also seized ten types of reactionary books at the defendant's home. The defendant claimed that the books belonged to Wang Boping, a resident on the upper floor. However, Wang Boping could not be found and summoned, and the defendant's name matched the name of the communication seized at the central organ of the Communist Party. There is a report from Western Detective Gode of the police station that can be cited as evidence (page 45 of the Second Branch of the High Court volume). It is clear that the defendant is a member of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi (Zhang Cinan), Pu Yifan, Wang Wu (Song Fengchun), Wang Yuping, He Afang, Wang Zhaoqun, Guo Jinghao (Peng Daozhi), Liang Youguang, and Wang Jiantang organized groups or assemblies for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China and have violated Article 6 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. Moreover, Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi used written materials to engage in treasonous propaganda, and Wang Ziping and He Afang helped with treasonous propaganda, which is highly suspected of violating Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the same law. The seized communist books and documents were used for committing crimes and preparing for crimes and should be confiscated in accordance with Article 10 of the same law and Article 60, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law. A public prosecution is hereby filed in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Appeal of Songxing Bank Creditors <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the County Court to Correct the Original Ruling</p>
<p>Impartial Judgment Requested Against Defendants Who Have Not Withdrawn</p>
<p>Regarding the Songjiang Bank debt case, the County Court sent out the original ruling on the 26th. Bai Guanlan and others applied for an appeal on the 27th. Yesterday (the 29th), they listed legal provisions to supplement the grounds for the appeal as follows: "㈠ Article 53 of the Code of Civil Procedure concerns necessary joint litigation. This case is not a necessary joint litigation, but an ordinary joint litigation. Since it is an ordinary joint litigation, Article 52 of the same law naturally applies. This is self-evident. ㈡ Why is this case not a necessary joint litigation? Necessary joint litigation has an inseparable nature from the beginning. The rationale of the same law takes easements as an example. Shi Zhiquan's annotated explanation of the Civil Procedure Regulations further cites the revocation of betrothals as examples. This kind of litigation objective with unified determination is fundamentally indivisible. It is very different from the joint defendants of joint and several debts, because suing one person or a part of the joint and several debtors is also effective. In other words, it is divisible everywhere. ㈢ Whether or not a debt is unified and determined is originally stipulated in substantive law. Article 272, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code stipulates that the establishment of joint and several liability is limited to cases where the law provides for it. Article 681 of the same law states that when the partnership property is insufficient to pay off the debts of the partnership, each partner shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency. Since Songjiang Bank has not been legally registered as a company, it cannot be regarded as a legal person and a partnership. Since it is a partnership, the creditor can naturally request full or partial payment from one or several or all of the debtors simultaneously or sequentially (see Article 273 of the Civil Code). Its nature is not only simply divisible, but also the creditor has the right to choose whether to divide or not, and there is absolutely no opposing provision. Since substantive law stipulates this way, procedural law naturally applies the articles for non-unified determination, namely Article 52 of the Code of Civil Procedure rather than Article 53. The original ruling stated that it is necessary to maintain the same state in substance, which means that the legal meaning of Article 273 of the Civil Code has not been considered. ㈣ It is found that Zhu Hezun and Gu Jiaxuan are part of the defendants. Withdrawing the case against these two is regarded as not suing these two. Moreover, when the withdrawal against the two was requested in court, the presiding judge asked why the withdrawal was made. The agent replied that it was because the two argued that they did not participate. Judge Pan then ordered the lawyer of the defendants Zhang Xiaolin etc. to argue. Then the lawyers of both parties debated each other. If the entire case was withdrawn, what would be the point of the debate? It is evident that the court did not consider the entire case withdrawn at that time. ㈤ Based on the above, the original ruling's citation of Article 53 of the Code of Civil Procedure is indeed erroneous, then the litigation costs cannot be applied according to Article 85 of the same law, but should</p>
<p>allow the substantive rights of the litigation to be decided in accordance with Article 87 of the same law. In short, the creditor's rights in this case are legally established, and the defendants should bear joint and several liability. The original ruling and your court's decision not to prosecute Zhang Xiaolin, etc. criminally has been explained in detail in the first half. The appellants are eager to appeal in accordance with the provisions of Article 449 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and request your court to review and verify and promptly correct the original ruling in accordance with the provisions of the first half of Article 457 of the same law, and to make a fair judgment on the joint defendants who have not withdrawn the case based on the prior complaint, and order the defendants to bear the litigation costs, for the sake of both public and private virtue."</p>
<h3 id="e86">Kidnapping Case Occurs in the Suburbs of Songjiang <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, robbery cases have occurred frequently in Songjiang. Unexpectedly, the Wang Guoqing family in Shanjiaqiao, outside the East Gate, three miles from the city, was also kidnapped by bandits on the night of the 29th. The Wang family is well-off and has long been coveted by bandits. That night, a bandit boat was parked in the river behind the Wang residence. There were about twelve or thirteen bandits, each holding a pistol, who rushed into the Wang residence and looted it. Because they did not gain much, they were not satisfied with their desires, and forced Wang Guoqing to hand over 2,000 yuan. Wang said he had no means to produce it, and was immediately tied up and taken to the boat. Wang's grandmother, unable to bear her beloved grandson being taken away, immediately collected 300 yuan in cash and chased after the bandit boat, intending to redeem her grandson. However, the bandits took the money and still refused to release him. Helplessly, she reported to the County Public Security Bureau for arrest on the morning of the 30th.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Wuxi Rice Prices Gradually Decline <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>This year's rice prices have reached their lowest point. At the end of the year, sales are increasingly sluggish. However, the amount of goods arriving is not very large, so market prices are only slightly decreasing day by day. The reason for this is that it is the end of the year, and most merchants are preparing to close their books. Merchants from Jinan, Tianjin, and other regions come to Wuxi to purchase goods, but shipping takes time, and it is too late to transport them back within the year, so they have stopped buying. Judging from the situation, the rice market will not improve much within the year. Yesterday's market price dropped slightly by a few cents. Top-grade coarse japonica rice was six yuan and eight cents, down to six yuan and one cent. Coarse large-grain indica rice was six yuan and four or five cents, down to six yuan. Coarse sheep indica rice was six yuan and six or seven cents, down to six yuan and two or three cents. Coarse wharf indica rice was six yuan and four or five cents, down to six yuan. Coarse Hakka indica rice was five yuan and five or six cents to five yuan and one or two cents. Coarse Yuan rice was seven yuan and two or three cents to seven yuan. High-grade white japonica rice was seven yuan and one or two cents to six yuan and seven or eight cents, down to six yuan and five or six cents. White Yuan rice was eight yuan and two or three cents to eight yuan. White sheep indica rice was seven yuan to six yuan and seven or eight cents. White large-grain indica rice was six yuan and eight or nine cents to six yuan and five or six cents. White wharf indica rice was six yuan and eight or nine cents to six yuan and six or seven cents. Hakka white indica rice was six yuan and four or five cents to six yuan and one cent. Japonica rice was three yuan and nine cents to three yuan and seven cents. Sheep indica rice was three yuan and five or six cents to three yuan and two or three cents. Wharf indica rice was three yuan and four or five cents. Hakka indica rice was three yuan and three or four cents to three yuan and one cent. Yuan rice was four yuan and two or three cents to four yuan and one cent.</p>

<p>Chenjia Lane, outside the west gate of Jiangyin, is only about three miles from the city. At about 7:00 pm on the 27th, the Jin Yaozu family, who runs a cloth factory, was suddenly visited by three robbers who claimed to be borrowing fire and entered the house to rob. One robber fired a shot to intimidate, hitting his accomplice Zhang Hesheng, who fell to the ground in extreme pain and was captured. The other two robbers escaped. Afterwards, the Fourth Public Security Sub-Bureau of the South Suburb reported to the county government, which sent police officers along with the provincial security regiment to search, but the robbers had already gone far. The captured robber Zhang Hesheng was sent to the county for interrogation on the 28th.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Chinese League for Civil Rights Holds Reception for Chinese and Foreign Journalists Yesterday <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese League for Civil Rights held a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at Hu'an Building at 4:00 pm yesterday. More than 30 journalists from local newspapers, magazines, and news agencies attended. Madam Sun Yat-sen, Ms. Soong Ching Ling, the chairman, was absent due to a cold. The reception was hosted by the vice-chairman Cai Yuanpei and the general secretary Yang Xingfo, who reported on the purpose of the organization and the current situation of the League for Civil Rights. After the report, Chinese and foreign journalists stood up one after another to express their opinions on the freedom of speech and publication. Vice-Chairman Cai Yuanpei gave satisfactory answers. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 6:00 pm. Details of the event are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Madam Sun's Speech <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Madam Sun was absent due to illness and sent a letter to express her apologies. After the journalists were all present, Chairman Cai Yuanpei stood up and read her speech on her behalf. It said, in brief, "Today is the day when the Chinese League for Civil Rights is hosting the Shanghai press. On behalf of the League, Qingling extends sincere wishes and welcomes to all of you. The press and the members of the League for Civil Rights share the responsibility of promoting the progress of human society. Therefore, I believe that, in theory, we should have a united front and faithful cooperation for our common mission. The purpose of the League is to assist all struggles for the freedom of association, assembly, speech, and publication. In other words, the League for Civil Rights is a fighter and defender of freedom of publication. Therefore, from the perspective of the publishing industry itself, it seems that this League should be given sincere support. One important point that Qingling would like to solemnly present to you is that the League's greatest effort is to assist the vast majority of political prisoners who are in prison without help or knowledge. As members of the press, you are well aware of the illegal detention of many of our countrymen and the existence of secret military trials, a relic of the Middle Ages. Will you remain silent and not protest against these things, or will you work together with the League for Civil Rights to shoulder this mutual responsibility?"</p>
<h3 id="e93">Cai Yuanpei's Speech <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Today, the founders of the League and I are hosting the journalists of this city. I am extremely grateful for your presence and guidance. Madam Sun has explained the intention of the League and its close relationship with the press. I would like to share my personal thoughts. What we want to protect is human rights, and our object is human beings. Since we are all human beings, we have a common and universal human right that should be protected. Therefore, first, we have no partisan prejudice, because what each party is fighting for has gone beyond universal human rights. We will never work exclusively for one party and disregard others. Second, we have no national boundaries, because whether someone is from country A or country B, since we are all human beings, we should not discriminate based on nationality. However, there is a difference in the opportunity to serve people depending on whether the location is near or far. We have more opportunities to serve people in our own country and fewer opportunities to serve foreigners. But foreigners also have their own comrades who can easily serve them. According to the division of labor, there is no difference. Third, we do not discriminate between those who have been convicted and those who have not. It is a matter of course that the human rights of those who have not been convicted should not be trampled on. For those who have been convicted, if they are innocent, there is of course a need for relief. As for those who have been convicted and are not innocent, if we follow the psychology of hating evil as an enemy, it seems that we can ignore everything. However, criminologists attribute human sins to physiological defects, and socialists attribute them to social causes. Even at the root of punishment befitting the crime, there is still room for consideration. Therefore, the ancients had the admonition "If you know the circumstances, have pity and do not rejoice," and the observation of tracing the past and understanding the truth. Even under legal sanctions, we must recognize that punishment befitting the crime is natural and should not be added to beyond the natural punishment. If there is any addition, there is also a need for protection, such as private torture and abuse in prisons. Therefore, we do not discriminate against those who are innocent or guilty. The news you preside over may be out of patriotism and give special care to your own country, or it may be because you have a special relationship with one party and often have the attitude of supporting party A and attacking party B in political views. This is indeed inevitable and unavoidable. However, I hope that you can transcend national and party relations in protecting universal human rights and make judgments accordingly. This is what I hope for.</p>

<p>Then, the general secretary of the association, Yang Xingfo, reported that the League was founded only half a month ago and has only established a temporary executive committee to handle the work. The purpose is to fully protect civil rights. In the future, branches will be established in Beijing, Shanghai, and Pingjin. Li Jizhi has been entrusted to handle the work in Beijing. Nanjing is being entrusted to handle the work. Because Shanghai has not yet publicly solicited members, the branch has not been formally organized and established. The formal executive committee must be established after the branches are established, and then the executive committees from various places will be convened to hold a national executive committee meeting, from which the formal executive committee will be produced. Today, we are hosting all the journalists, ㈠ hoping that you can understand the organization of our association, ㈡ hoping that all of you present will take the lead in joining our association, etc.</p>

The Executive Committee entrusted Dr. Li to be responsible for organizing a branch in Beiping after arriving in Beiping. In addition, the association sent another telegram to the Beiping Public Security Bureau regarding the recent illegal detention of dozens of teachers and students in Beiping, hearing that only Xu Deheng was released on bail by President Jiang of Peking University. The telegram reads as follows: "Bao, Director of the Beiping Public Security Bureau, Greetings. We have heard that only Xu Deheng has been released on bail among the teachers and students illegally detained in Beiping, and the remaining dozens are still detained by your bureau. The government is strongly advocating the protection of all freedoms of the people, but how can your bureau explain its actions? We urge you to release all the detained teachers and students immediately in order to respect public opinion and protect civil rights. We look forward to a reply by telegram.

Other parts will then continue to move in order, with the aim of completing the move completely within January. The moving fee approved this time is only 500 yuan, which may not be enough. During the move, routine official business will be suspended for two days.</p>

<p>The Municipal Bank of this city remitted 40,000 yuan from the surplus of the previous year's settlement and delivered it to the municipal government. Although the bank was affected by the war, it still had a surplus to remit, which shows that it is loyal in its work and effective in its management. Yesterday, it specially prepared a letter to the bank's board of directors for commendation. The original letter stated, "Reply to your association's official letter, which stated that since the establishment of the bank, thanks to the supervision and guidance of your municipal government, the business has been able to progress gradually. However, due to the impact of the January 28th Incident this year, it has not been able to fully develop, which is regrettable. Now, at the time of this session's final accounts, the board held its 39th meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month to discuss all items of allocation. In addition to the usual appropriations, there is still a surplus in this session. A special allocation of 40,000 yuan is sent to your government to fulfill its responsibilities. This has been resolved and passed and is hereby recorded and reported for your inspection and reply. Approved. Since Shanghai has suffered from war and upheaval, all industries have declined, and financial institutions have been particularly affected. The municipal bank alone has been able to maintain its efforts and progress amid the storm, and has been able to manage its affairs with ease and achieve remarkable results. The final accounts for this session show that there is still a surplus beyond the usual appropriations. This is due to the fact that all employees have been loyal to their duties and have been able to achieve this. In the future, the internal foundation will be more solid, and the external reputation will be even more evident. The future is unlimited. After reading this, we are extremely pleased. All the 40,000 yuan in surplus remitted to the government, in addition to notifying the Finance Bureau, is hereby replied for your information. This is addressed to the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Bank."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Central Mint to Begin Casting on March 1, Year 22 <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter met with Finance Minister Song and had the following conversation. According to Minister Song, the Shanghai Central Mint plans to begin casting on March 1, Year 22. For those entrusting silver for casting, each yuan will cost approximately seven mace, one candareen, and five cash of silver. Furthermore, the Central Mint can create silver bars with a purity of 999/1000, and the pure silver content will be equivalent to 1,000 new silver coins. The Mint will also charge a casting fee for those requesting the Mint to cast silver bars. The calculation of the casting fee will be equivalent to the casting fee for 1,000 new silver coins, plus the refining fee. The amount of the refining fee will depend on the type of silver submitted. Minister Song also stated that a Shanghai Central Mint Advisory Committee will be formed, comprised of leaders from the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors, to assist the Mint in maintaining the legal purity of the new silver coins. In addition, renowned chemical testing experts will be hired as chemists for the Mint. Minister Song's plan, if realized, will likely prevent the Shanghai tael exchange rate from being higher than the current market rate.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Public Concession Increases Number of Chinese Land Commissioners <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Selection Procedures Still Under Dispute: In early summer of this year, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession passed a resolution to increase the number of Chinese Land Commissioners by two. They directly negotiated with the Concession authorities to implement this. Subsequently, the Consul General of the Protecting Power in Shanghai agreed. However, according to Article 28 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, the local officials' consent is required. Therefore, British Consul General Brenan and American Consul General Cunningham addressed Mayor Wu in late July. However, the Municipal Council believes that the nominees should be subject to the Council's approval. Thus, in early October, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association directly sent a letter to the Municipal Government, expressing their opposition to the Council's approval, and requested that negotiations be conducted with Consul General Cunningham, the leader of the consular body. In mid-October, the Municipal Government forwarded the Chinese Ratepayers' Association's opinion to Consul General Cunningham for review. It is now known that Mr. Cunningham replied a few days ago, which has been sent to the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Government has forwarded it to the Ratepayers' Association for review. The original letter from the Municipal Government to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, the following is an excerpt from the letter from the American Consul General and Leader of the Consular Body: Regarding the addition of two Chinese commissioners to the Land Commission, the Leader of the Consular Body forwarded a proposal to the Municipal Council on July 27, and approved the public letter of October 13. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association's public letter expressed opposition to the requirement that the two Chinese commissioner nominees in the proposal must be agreed upon by the Municipal Council and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Municipal Council and the Chinese Property Owners' Association. The opinions stated by the Association are very pertinent and reasonable. Based on this, the Council was asked to consider these opinions. Now, the Director-General of the Council has replied, stating that after further consideration, the Council believes that if Item A of the resolution passed by the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting is retained, it can be implemented accordingly. Item A was contained in the letter of July 27, namely, "A. One of the two newly added Chinese Commissioners to the Land Commission must be appointed by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association. The appointee must not be a property owner or a representative of a property owner. The other commissioner shall be appointed by the Chinese Property Owners' Association." As such, if the Chinese Commissioners are appointed separately by the Ratepayers' Association and the Property Owners' Association according to the above method, the Municipal Council is willing to withdraw the restriction stated in Item B of the previous letter that the approval of the Municipal Council is required. However, as stated in the Ratepayers' Association's public letter of October 13, the Ratepayers' Association and the Property Owners' Association must still exchange opinions with the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council when selecting the Chinese Commissioners. Now that the Municipal Council has responded to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association's wishes regarding the selection of Chinese Commissioners, it is hoped that Your Honorable Mayor will provide written confirmation of agreement to the Municipal Council's revised proposal. If it is necessary to amend the Yangjingbang Regulations, we can submit our opinions to the Diplomatic Body. A response is requested. Respectfully, etc. Based on this, the previous letter was duly forwarded for your information. Now, in accordance with the preceding, a corresponding letter is sent for your review, and a prompt response is requested. Respectfully, Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai.</p>

<p>Hua Guoxi, a Chinese worker who was a barber in Japan, was deported back to Shanghai during the Shanghai war and resided on Wusong Road. In mid-December, he took the Japanese ship Mikasa Maru to Yokohama again. After purchasing a ticket and boarding the ship, he hurriedly misplaced his Japanese police permit. Fearing that he would not be able to disembark in Yokohama, Hua landed in Osaka. Hua secretly disembarked in Osaka, intending to avoid the scrutiny of the Japanese police in Yokohama, which led to his detention. Since Hua had friends in Osaka, he thought he could obtain a guarantee to avoid any unexpected incidents. However, after Hua disembarked, the Japanese police discovered him and telegraphed to various places to conduct a thorough search. Hua was greatly alarmed upon hearing this news and rushed from Osaka to Kyoto to take temporary refuge. However, the police were everywhere, and Hua was arrested as soon as he arrived in Kyoto. He was sent to the Osaka Police Station on the 26th of this month and imprisoned. The original plan was to put him on the Asosan Maru to Shanghai, but due to a lack of time, a telegram was sent yesterday to change the plan to the original ship, Mikasa Maru, which will arrive in Shanghai on January 2. At that time, he will be transferred to the Public Security Bureau to recover all expenses. Before this incident, a group of overseas Chinese, including Lin Shengyou, Lu Dehai, He Congzheng, and Yang Zhaofu, traveled from Shanghai to Japan and were detained by the Kobe Water Police Station. They were not allowed to disembark and were sent back to Shanghai on the original ship. Each person had prepaid in cash, which was deducted as travel expenses, so they suffered both mentally and financially.</p>

<p>A Crew Member of the Ill-Fated New Fu Tai is a Model of Social Service: The New Fu Tai vessel struck a reef at Jigu Reef at 4:45 AM on the 26th of this month. The vessel immediately sent out a distress signal via wireless radio, which was received by the Shanghai Coast Radio Station, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Radio Station, and the Tongshun Steamer. The report was immediately made to the shipping company, and the Tongshun Steamer sailed to the vicinity of the distressed vessel, rescuing over twenty crew members by sampan. When the sampan went to rescue a second time, the New Fu Tai was gradually sinking, but the vessel's radio operator continued to communicate and call for help with the rescuers. The captain, seeing that the situation was critical, rushed to the radio room and urged the radio operator to quickly escape to the sampan. However, the radio operator, with a strong sense of responsibility, was unwilling to leave. The captain and the first mate, seeing that the situation was hopeless, forcibly pulled him out and lowered him into the sampan by a rope from the side of the ship. At that time, the wind and waves were very strong, and the sampan was swaying and unstable. With a single misstep, he was submerged. At first, he stretched out his arms and called for help, but a wave swept him away, and he disappeared in an instant. At the same time, the sampan capsized, and the captain, first mate, and over twenty other people were also in distress. The above is according to the eyewitness accounts of the rescued crew members. The wireless radio operator's name was Jin Changcheng, a native of Jiangning, Jiangsu, 21 years old, with an elderly father who depended on him for a living. He was a first-class graduate of the Shanghai China Wireless Radio Engineering School, excelling in both character and academics, and was highly valued by his teachers. He was especially responsible in his service, so he remained calm in the face of disaster and worked hard to call for help, ultimately enabling some of the crew members to be rescued. Mr. Jin sacrificed his life because of his strong sense of responsibility and his escape was the last. Mr. Jin is truly a model of social service.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Record of the Trial of Male and Female Members of the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Group's Headquarters Were Located in the Unified Hotel; The Police Have Arrested Five Group Members; The Trial Was Held Yesterday; The Court Was Heavily Guarded; The Prosecutor Stated That It Meets the Requirements for Exemption from Prosecution</p>
<p>Following the arrest and conviction of Yun Huifang, a member of the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group, seven more people, including Liu Chongwu, were arrested. The police filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court. Details of the trial on the afternoon of the previous day were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Unexpectedly, on the 22nd of this month, five more men and women, including Luo Sizhang, were arrested and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Since the police investigation was not yet complete, the court ordered a temporary postponement of the publication. The investigation has now been completed, and the trial was held publicly by the First Special Court yesterday morning. The detailed circumstances are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Arrest: Zhao Bingkun, the Chinese Deputy Inspector of the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police, after detaining Yun Huifang and Liu Chongwu, members of the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group whose sole purpose was to eliminate traitors, secretly investigated the group's headquarters and accomplices. It was not until the 22nd of this month that the room number 41 in the Unified Hotel on Beihai Road, which was the group's headquarters, was discovered. At 2:00 PM, he led the Fourth District detectives to raid the room. In the room, four people were arrested: Luo Sizhang (also known as Luo Yixin), 20 years old, from Anhui; Lu Yong, 16 years old, from Pudong; Wu Hongsheng, 18 years old, from Shanghai; and Zhang Guifang, 18 years old, a woman from Pudong. A large amount of explosives, two bombs, and raw materials for making bombs were confiscated and taken back to the police station. Under questioning, it was learned that there were other accomplices hiding in the Yongyu Qianzhuang on Ningbo Road. Subsequently, Hong Zhifang, 20 years old, from Shaoxing, was arrested. In Hong's home at No. 105 Haig Road, an empty bomb shell, a bomb design, and six rifle bullets were confiscated and brought back to the police station, where they were detained separately. They were then sent to the First Special Court. Because the crime had not yet been clarified, the police lawyer requested permission to detain them, which the court granted.</p>
<p>The Crimes: The police then began to investigate. The results showed that Luo Sizhang, Lu Yong, and Hong Zhifang obtained a hand grenade from Hong Zhifang at 5:00 PM on the 20th of this month and went with Luo Sizhang to throw the grenade at the Wanshun Chang Foreign Goods Store at No. 257 Nanjing Road, because they found that Wanshun Chang was selling Japanese goods. At that time, Luo stood at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road, while Lu went inside. Shortly after, he came out and threw the grenade inside. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out near Wanshun Chang at this time, and the fire brigade was doing its best to put out the fire, so Wanshun Chang was also watered, and the ground was full of water. Therefore, the grenade landed in the water and did not explode, and Wanshun Chang did not report the incident to the police. Therefore, the police did not know about it. After Luo and others confessed, the police took Luo and Lu to the store to demonstrate the situation at the time and asked the store if they had been bombed. The store denied being bombed but said that they had previously received warning letters from the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group Youth League. The police immediately ordered Luo et al. to make a list, detailing everything.</p>
<p>Court Security: Yesterday morning, the case was scheduled for trial. At 8:30 AM, the police escorted Luo et al. by car to the waiting room of the First Special Court Criminal Division. In order to prevent any unexpected incidents, a police car loaded with dozens of Chinese and Western police officers from the reserve team was dispatched to the gate of the court at Qipu Road. The car stopped in the middle of the road with a machine gun mounted on the roof for security. The Chinese Detective Chief Zhang Wenjun and the Western Detective Chief of the jurisdiction police station led the Chinese and Western police officers to the court to assist the bailiffs in maintaining order and preventing any disturbances. Personnel Present at the Hearing: At 9:10 AM, Qian Hongye, Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the Special Court, Chief Prosecutor Wang Zuze, and Clerk Guan Zhiliang took their seats in the First Criminal Division. The police were represented by Lawyer Ru Baoyi, and the defendants were represented by Lawyers Yuan Yang'an, Qu Yue, and Xi Yafu. The police listed Luo Sizhang as the first defendant, Lu Yong as the second defendant, Wu Hongsheng as the third defendant, Zhang Guifang as the fourth defendant, and Hong Zhifang as the fifth defendant.</p>
<p>Prosecution Laws: Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police first stated the articles of prosecution, saying that the police were prosecuting the five defendants for the crime of obstructing order by participating in a society whose purpose was to commit crimes, according to Article 161 of the Criminal Law, and for the crime of illegally possessing military firearms and explosives, according to Article 1 of the Regulations on the Prohibition of Military Firearms and Artillery. Since Luo, Lu, and Hong threw a bomb at Wanshun Chang, they were charged with the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 318 of the Criminal Law. Lawyer's Statement: When the defendants were arrested, a seal of the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group and a design for preparing to engrave the seal of the Zhongmin Patriotic Advancement Team were found, indicating that they were organized. A notebook was also confiscated, which contained records of their meetings, as well as the Zhongmin Patriotic Advancement Team's articles of association and declarations. Articles 7 and 8 of the articles of association state the methods of warning treacherous merchants, such as shooting, striking, or bombing. If anyone obstructs the progress, they will be dealt with by force. This shows that their organization is for the purpose of committing crimes, and the articles of association and declarations all bear the signatures of defendants one, two, three, and five. Although the fourth defendant is not named, she is also an accomplice and should be held responsible under Article 161 of the Criminal Law. The crime of illegally possessing explosives is also very clear, as dangerous goods were found in the defendants' places of arrest, so no explanation is needed. The crime of obstructing freedom committed by the defendants is also very clear. Because the defendants learned that Wanshun Chang was selling Japanese goods, they went to throw a bomb on the 20th of this month. Fortunately, it did not explode. The defendants also admitted that they had previously sent a warning letter, but the letter had been discarded by Wanshun Chang, so it is impossible to know what was said in it. The reports and confessions of each person were submitted to the court. The confessions of Luo and Hong were written in their own handwriting, while the rest were recorded by the police and signed and fingerprinted by the defendants.</p>
<p>Western Detective's Report: Western Detective Chief Gribble then testified that, "We first arrested the first, second, and third defendants in the Unified Hotel. Later, fearing that there were more revolutionaries, we sent detectives to guard the inside. At 10:30 AM, Zhang Guifang came, and the detective arrested her. Explosives were found on her. According to her, Luo Sizhang feared that these items would be dangerous in the inn, so he asked her to take them to her home. Because they were needed today, she was ordered to bring them back. Finally, Hong Zhifang was also arrested. Their group's first regular meeting was held on September 18 at No. 22 Guling Road, where it was decided to change the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group to the Zhongmin Patriotic Advancement Team. Luo Sizhang proposed to find a way to obtain small arms, and Wu Zhengming proposed to use hydrochloric acid and other things to warn treacherous merchants. The second regular meeting was held on November 24 at No. 9 Nanlin Lane, Haining Road. Cai Yaozu reported on the economic situation, Luo Sizhang reported on the preparations for weapons, and leaflets warning treacherous merchants and a warning letter to the Nanshi National Goods Market were passed. The contents of the leaflets were not only unfavorable to treacherous merchants, but also unfavorable to the police lawyer. At that time, we found a jar of road salt, which, according to Luo, belonged to Wang Shao-cheng of No. 209 Xizang Road. Wang is wanted by the police for the murder of Wang Zhengtao at No. 310 and No. 312 Xinzha Road. The bomb we seized was prepared to be sent to the Nanshi National Goods Market. The Wanshun Chang case was discussed and decided in advance at a meeting in Baik Road. Later, Detective Zhao and I led the second defendant, Luo, to the store to demonstrate the situation." Wang Shengmu, the assistant manager of Wanshun Chang, testified that "Our store does not sell enemy goods. However, the old inventory in the store must be sold due to capital constraints." He denied that a bomb had been thrown.</p>
<p>Defendant's Testimony: Defendant Luo Sizhang testified, "Although I am the Deputy Captain, I was actually used as a scapegoat by the group. All affairs were presided over by Cai Yaozu. I deny participating in the bombing of Wanshun Chang. I confessed because I was afraid of police torture. The truth is that on the 19th, Lu Yong told me that he was going to bomb Wanshun Chang. I dissuaded him. Unexpectedly, Lu came the next day and said that he had bombed the store. I severely reprimanded him, so I did not actually participate in this matter." The court then asked about the discussions with Zhang Guifang and the relationship between them. Luo replied that they met at the Renji Hospital and had no relationship. He was asked if it was because he was afraid that the explosives in the hotel would be dangerous that he ordered Zhang to take them for safekeeping. Luo replied that the item was given to him by Cai Yaozu and he did not know what it was. Later, Zhang came to his place to take it away. He did not know at first, but later, after Zhang took it away, he told her that it was dangerous and ordered her to send it back. He did not order her to take it away. He was asked whether Zhang Guifang had previously been fined 20 yuan by the court for soliciting customers as a prostitute, and there was a fingerprint record to prove it. He was asked whether he knew that she was a prostitute and had an affair with her, otherwise, why would he give her such an important item to take back and forth. He replied that there was no such thing. Zhang Guifang testified, "My younger brother was sick, so I accompanied him to the Renji Hospital for treatment. That's when I met Luo, and we have no relationship. On the morning of the 21st, I went to Luo's hotel and took the dangerous item from the drawer. Later, Luo told me that it was dangerous and ordered me to send it back, so I sent it back and was arrested." The court asked her if she had previously been fined for prostitution, and Zhang firmly denied it. Lu Yong testified, "Although I am a member of the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group, I did not throw the bomb. I confessed to the Wanshun Chang case because I was afraid of torture. I only know that Chen Guangxiang sent a warning letter to the store." The court asked if he had persuaded Wu Hongsheng to join the Blood Soul Group. He replied that he had not. Wu Hongsheng testified that he was friends with Luo Sizhang et al. and was a colleague in the Volunteer Army. Lu Yong did not persuade him to join the Blood Soul Group. Hong Zhifang was in the construction industry. Regarding the police's confession, he said that the detectives had written the draft and ordered him to copy it. He denied participating in the bombing. Start of Debate: At this point, the court ordered the start of the debate. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police stated that the defendants' organization of a group for the purpose of committing crimes and their bombing and intimidation were very obvious. According to their crimes, there was no excuse. However, the defendants were all very young, and this point could be forgiven. If the court gave a reduced sentence, his lawyer would agree and requested that a judgment be made according to the law. The defendants' representatives, Lawyers Yuan, Qu, and Xi, successively argued, generally dividing the following points: (1) Since the treacherous merchants are called treacherous and harm the interests of the Republic of China, the defendants' removal of them is not a crime. (2) The police cannot prove that the explosives were definitely possessed by the defendants. (3) The confession cannot be proven to be true. (4) The police lawyer's final conclusion is quite appropriate and should be given special attention. (5) Please refer to Articles 66 and 76 of the Criminal Law to grant a special reduced sentence and request that a suspended sentence be pronounced at the same time as the guilty verdict in accordance with Article 90 of the Criminal Law. Finally, Prosecutor Wang rose to state his opinion, saying that although the two articles of prosecution by the police can be divided into three situations, they are actually one act. According to Article 74 of the Criminal Law, a heavier sentence should be imposed. Since the defendants were motivated by patriotism, they violated the law. Considering their circumstances, they meet the requirements for exemption from prosecution. Please judge them according to the law. Scheduled Sentencing: Judge Qian then concluded the debate on the case and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of January 5. Wu Hongsheng and Zhang Guifang were allowed to post a 500 yuan bail bond each. The rest were detained. After the verdict was announced, the police security was also withdrawn at the same time. It was already past noon.</p>

<p>A Bold Undertaking to Circumnavigate the World Departing from Shanghai Next Month: According to the North China Daily News, a New Yorker named White Bromsheld has purchased a Chinese-style sandboat, only 65 feet long, and is modifying it. He named it New Horizon and plans to depart from Shanghai in January to circumnavigate the world. The ship was built in Ningbo and was completed just a year ago. It has already been sailing at sea for five months. When it departs in the future, in addition to White Bromsheld and Evansworth, four crew members will be hired. Initially, Chinese crew members will be hired, and in the future, it is hoped that Europeans will be used. The route will be from Shanghai to Hong Kong, then through the Philippines, Guam, Honolulu, through the Panama Canal, and then to Europe. Several months ago, a Chinese-style sandboat departed from Shanghai, and a Frenchman sailed it for a long ocean voyage, but unfortunately, it sank in Taiwan. This will be the second Chinese-style sandboat to circumnavigate the world.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Eight Ningbo Fishermen Rescued by the Shengjing Steamer <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, eight Ningbo fishermen recently drifted in the Yellow Sea and hoped to be rescued for twelve hours. They were rescued by the Taikoo Shingking Steamer on Wednesday morning and brought to Shanghai. The Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association sent them back to their hometown. They left Shanghai on the Ningxing Steamer of the Sanbei Company yesterday (29th) afternoon. When they boarded the ship, they were so happy to have survived that they used the remaining money from the repatriation fee given by the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association to buy firecrackers and firecrackers, as well as peanuts and fruit, to share with the coolies and boat boys at the pier to celebrate. It can also be seen that their situation in the sea was dangerous and their rescue was unexpected, so they were extremely happy. It is said that eight people left Ningbo on a fishing boat several months ago. On Tuesday night in the Yellow Sea, they were suddenly hit by a steamer. The mast broke and the boat leaked, but the steamer broke through the waves and left as if nothing had happened. The eight people drifted on the sea, thinking that there was no hope of survival. Fortunately, the Shengjing Steamer, which was sailing from Tianjin to Shanghai, saw their mast sinking at about 9:00 AM on Wednesday morning. It rushed to the side of the ship, threw the cable to tie it up, and then pulled the eight people one by one onto the ship, giving them food and clothing. At that time, the boat was almost full of water and would sink in an instant. There was little hope that these people would not be buried in the belly of the fish. When the Shengjing arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, the eight people were sent to the Water Patrol Police Station and transferred to the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. It is now heard that the Customs authorities will be asked to thoroughly investigate the steamer that caused the disaster and did not provide assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Zhou Fengyi's Bestial Acts <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Accused of raping his eleven-year-old adopted daughter, the court should severely punish him. Shen Zhifa, a Ningbo native currently residing at 6 Annam Road in the French Concession, is 48 years old. He previously ran a coal business but became a vegetable vendor at a small market after losing his job. He has five daughters and two sons. Zhou Feng, a Tianjin native (37 years old), currently working as a needle worker but previously a constable residing at 17 Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, in the French Concession, was an old neighbor. Zhou, after marrying, did not have children, so the couple was very fond of Shen's children. In July of last year, Shen's wife died, and he was burdened with the care of his children. Therefore, he gave his fifth daughter, Xiaomao (11 years old this year), to Zhou as an adopted daughter. At the time, Shen did not draw up a contract, nor did he receive any money from Zhou. Zhou took the girl to raise, and the two sides considered themselves relatives by adoption and visited each other from time to time. Unexpectedly, Zhou, a man with the face of a human but the heart of a beast, repeatedly raped the girl in the months of July, August, and November of this year and forbade her from speaking out. However, Xiaomao was young and not fully developed. After being violated, she fell ill, her face became yellow and emaciated, and her urethra was damaged, causing constant urination. Zhou did not provide medical treatment. Until the 27th of this month, for the 70th birthday of the girl's maternal grandmother, Shen went to Zhou's place and took Xiaomao to her grandmother's house to celebrate her birthday. In the afternoon, he wanted to send the girl back to Zhou's house, but the girl feared Zhou's abuse and refused to go back. Her grandmother thought the girl was being wilful and playful, so she kept her overnight and told Shen to pick her up the next day. The next day, the girl's grandmother wanted to send the girl back herself, but the girl cried and refused to go to Zhou's house again. When asked, she revealed the details of the rape. Her grandmother was shocked upon hearing this and immediately informed her son-in-law (the girl's father), who reported it to the French Concession police. Detective Zhu Junpei was dispatched to arrest Zhou. Meanwhile, the head detective ordered the girl to be sent to Guangci Hospital, where Doctor Brisset (professor of medicine at Aurora University) examined her and confirmed that the girl's hymen had been ruptured due to rape, issuing a diagnosis certificate to be attached to the case file by the police. Yesterday, the police escorted Zhou to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Xiong Huihua and Clerk Tao Zongkan presided over Criminal Court One to hear the case. The police lawyer, Gu Shouquan, explained the case, stating that the defendant had committed indecent acts against a minor and was being prosecuted under Article 243, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Criminal Code for offenses against public morals, requesting severe punishment according to the law. At this point, the court, considering the case to be one of public morals, inquired whether spectators should be prohibited. After questioning, the defendant directly confessed. The court ordered a date to be set for further interrogation and instructed the plaintiff, Shen Zhifa, to take the girl to the court's forensic doctor for examination in the afternoon for verification.</p>

<p>Cordiality in the courtroom, the judge orders out-of-court reconciliation. Zhu Lunqing, 68 years old, from Ci’xi, Ningbo, an assistant manager at Yongju Money Shop in Ningbo Road, Tonghe Lane, was sued by his third concubine, Zhu Zhang, 22 years old, from Huzhou, for abandonment. The First Special District Court had concluded its hearing and acquitted Zhu Lunqing. Subsequently, Zhu Zhang, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Liu Hongxun to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. There had been two summons for questioning, but Zhu was ill, so it did not proceed. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the case was heard again by Judge Zhao Zhengdang with Judges Cai and Guo. The appellant, Zhu Zhang, brought a son and a daughter to the court, and the appellee, Zhu Lunqing, also arrived with lawyer Zhao Zuwei. Zhu Zhang stated that she was currently 22 years old and residing at her cousin's house at 60 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road. Because Zhu had driven her out, forced her to write a divorce agreement, and failed to provide for her needs, effectively abandoning her, she had filed a lawsuit. When she was 14 years old, she came to Shanghai from her native Huzhou to escape the war and stayed at her cousin's place. Her cousin was Zhu Lunqing's second concubine and asked her to stay temporarily in the small room. One night, Zhu used a small knife to pry open the door and entered, asking for sexual favors. Because she was young, ignorant, and had no ability to resist, she was raped. The next day, her cousin saw her crying and questioned her, and she told her everything. The cousin negotiated with Zhu to no avail and, since what was done could not be undone, advised her to marry Zhu. Because she had already lost her virginity, she agreed. At the beginning of the marriage, Zhu treated her well. At 15 and 16 years old, she gave birth to two sons, and at 19, she gave birth to a daughter. However, the eldest son had already died, and now only a six-year-</p>

<p>(1) Why is education not doing well? Why is it that farmers don't have enough to eat?</p>
<p>[Letter from Mr. Gao Mianzhi]</p>
<p>I have two questions here. First, the education issue: Since I started working in rural education at the age of seventeen, it has been nine years. In the first five years, I was controlled by local bullies (school board members) and surrounded by petty people. Although I gained the trust of farmers, I resigned because I was from another place. In the summer of the eighteenth year, I admired the name of Xiaozhuang School and traveled to Ningbo with two or three like-minded comrades at our own expense to visit for more than a month. At the same time, the education sector of this county also organized a visiting group to go, but I have not heard any report from them about it. However, I, together with my comrades, went to four rural areas to find a school site and establish the school. For two years, there has been no assistance from the administrative authorities above, and jealousy from colleagues (education is not a profession) below, making progress extremely difficult! I now want to ask: (1) Why can't the local bullies who control education be overthrown? (2) Why are there no reports from those who went on official-funded visits? Why can't those who are interested in visiting get official funding? (3) Why do the administrative authorities verbally emphasize rural education but fail to provide actual assistance? (4) Why are colleagues jealous instead of cooperating? (5) Is working hard in rural education being a bookworm, and should people look at me as a bookworm? Second, the rural issue: In the rural society near the school, the people are diligent and thrifty, and they do not know about smoking or gambling. Last year, due to weather conditions, the rice harvest was not good. Even when it comes to firewood, this year's farmers are also feeling the pain of not having enough firewood to burn. Therefore, this year farmers have to eat rice that costs 16 yuan per dan; local products, in addition to rice, also include silkworm cocoons and beans and wheat in the spring and summer. Unexpectedly, this year's beans and wheat are almost so cheap that no one wants them, and silkworm cocoons are only one jiao per piece. This has already made the farmers suffer enough, but who knew there was some ×××; the army came to the countryside and stayed for more than two months. Although there were no major losses, the cost of providing for them was already very difficult! Alas! Unfortunate farmers, who could have imagined that they would have to suffer so much now? They worked hard for a year, and the rice matured, averaging five hu per mu, but who knew it was all in vain, and the rice price was only worth six yuan! Please look at their expenses: (1) Cattle fees (2) Rice fees (3) Grain tax (4) Mu tax (5) Rent rice (6) Account fees! Let's calculate the straw and rice fees: sixteen yuan plus interest requires three shi of rough rice to exchange for one shi of white rice! Therefore, there are several questions here that farmers asked me but I couldn't answer, so I am raising them all here and asking for answers: (1) Why is it that farmers don't have enough to eat? (2) Why are agricultural products such as rice, wheat, beans, and silk so cheap? (3) Why are things in stores so expensive? (4) Why are taxes so high? (5) What use do we have for the army?</p>
<p>...Reporter's note: The points raised by Mr. Gao are indeed very important issues at present. The reporter believes they are worthy of public discussion, so I am hereby inviting readers to discuss them together.</p>
<p>(2) What is it that everyone wants to say right now?</p>
<p>[Letter from Mr. Zhang Conglong]</p>
<p>My opinion: The Reader's Advisory section in Shen Bao is too boring. It is a very good and beneficial teacher, but it is just directing some lost people, and only providing some so-called unemployed people with some meaningless slogans, saying that the social environment is bad, or that they can't even find work, just waving their pens and complaining. You need to know that there are three conditions for finding work: First, you must ask yourself if you have the skills to work. Factories are not nursing homes, they don't want these amateurs. Second, can you endure hardship? Work requires effort. Third, then you can say that the society is bad and the government is incompetent. Why don't you open a few writing factories to support us? I don't believe that workers with skills and the ability to endure hardship will be unable to find food and starve to death. There are also some ladies, or disguised female geniuses, who open their mouths to say that marriage is bad, and ask for remedies, and close their mouths to say that the other party is bad, and seek free ways out, or create rumors and show off. I think in this world, not to mention that women are oppressed by their husbands, looking around, across the six continents, there is great oppression and small oppression, who is not living under oppression. I have never spoken empty words, but today I have caught the disease. As for communications discussing scientific knowledge, or texts seeking cooperation from all walks of life to start a business, then perhaps it can arouse the interest of some people.</p>
<p>Reply: After reading your letter, we feel that your thoughts are really contradictory. Since you know that everyone in the "world" is "living under oppression," why do you say that the "slogans" of "general" "unemployed people" are all "meaningless" "complaints"? Do you mean that many oppressed people should obey "oppression" to the end and should not have any resistance? The "badness" of the current society is known to anyone who usually pays a little attention to observing society, and you still say that this general cry is "complaining," then what kind of cry is considered "meaningful"? What is not "complaining"? We also know that working requires certain "skills" and the ability to "endure hardship," but is the current problem a problem of "skills" and "endurance"? Everyone can see how many people with "skills" and the ability to "endure hardship" are still inevitably "unemployed" and inevitably "starve to death." Whose fault is this? Are floods, droughts, wars, banditry, and all other "oppressions" "gifts" from "Old Man Heaven"? Or is it "bad human planning"? Are the crowds of unemployed people all unemployed because they lack "skills" and the inability to "endure hardship"? For example, if you want to start a "business" now, can your "skills" and ability to "endure hardship" alone make the business flourish? Are there other obstacles that will cause your business to fail in the end? Everyone is busy discussing reforms to address these serious problems in front of them, and you lightly dismiss them with the word "complaining," which really makes us "confused." As for the marriage issue, although many people have fought for it, even today, it is still not possible to universally obtain "freedom." The facts are also very clear, but you think that the purpose of the calls under this unfree oppression is to "show off." The immaturity of the theory is equally laughable. In short, we also know that we should now engage in so-called "construction" and should study more natural sciences. However, with society like this, unless there is a transformation first, how can we talk about anything? We have no preconceptions. We only know to follow everyone. What everyone says in their letters is what we will publish. You want us to publish more letters about studying "science" and "business," and we are not willing to do so, but what if the letters that come are all painful "slogans" and "complaints"?</p>

<p>Hua An Cooperation's Great Solicitation Competition: Hua An Cooperation Life Insurance Company of Jing'an Temple Road in this city is a purely Chinese-owned organization, operating as a life insurance company using Anglo-American scientific management methods.

<p>Scott Cup Football Tournament Semifinals</p>
<h3 id="e130">Jinan Sadly Eliminated <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Two Players Injured Within the First Twenty-Five Minutes</p>
<p>Fighting with Only Nine Players Proves Too Difficult</p>
<p>"Lancashire Wins 3-2"</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jinan faced Lancashire in the Scott Cup semifinals at the Recreation Ground. Based on past performance, even without Chen Zhenhe and Luo Haiguang, Jinan should have been able to defeat Lancashire and secure a spot in the finals. Unexpectedly, fortune was not on their side, and misfortune struck repeatedly. Within the first twenty-five minutes, Jinan lost two major players, Xu Yahui and Zhong Guanming, due to injuries. Afterward, they had to play with only nine players. Despite their best efforts and scoring two goals, they were ultimately outnumbered and suffered a heartbreaking 3-2 defeat. Thus, Jinan was eliminated from the Scott Cup, leaving the blue-eyed, blonde-haired foreigners to compete for the championship. The lineups for both teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Lancashire:</p>
<p>Hill, Sarlefe, McDonald, Lyons, Ma Sheng, Zhao Bei, Lawton, Pitt, Barnes, Marius, Kai Zhi.</p>
<p>Jinan Team:</p>
<p>Liang Shutang, Liu Zukan, Gu Shang, Zhong Guanming, Xu Heng, Zhuang Shihong, Xu Yahui, Jiang Shanjing, Chen Zhenxiang, Xie Quanhe, Mei Hongbao.</p>
<p>Qiu Balian Scores Two Goals: What caught the eye in Jinan's lineup yesterday was Xie Quanhe, originally the goalkeeper, who was reassigned to right forward, with Xu Heng, famous in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, taking over as goalkeeper. However, Xu's skills did not stand out. As the match began, both sides were eager to win, and the competition was fierce. Jinan conceded a goal to Lancashire's center forward Lawton due to a misunderstanding between Jiang Shanjing and the goalkeeper, just five minutes into the game. At the same time, Zhong Guanming was injured and left the field. Amidst the chaotic struggle, Jinan launched several attacks, but none were effective. In the twentieth minute, Lancashire's Barnes scored again, making the score 2-0.</p>
<p>Jinan Returns the Favor: Having conceded two goals, Jinan was incensed and launched a full-scale counterattack. Less than five minutes later, Jiang Shanjing sent a long ball from the back, Mei Hongbao carried the ball forward, passing two defenders, and at a suitable spot, he passed it to Chen Zhenxiang, who seized the opportunity and scored, returning the favor. Amid the fierce battle, Zhuang Shihong was also suddenly injured, but fortunately, he recovered quickly. Unexpectedly, Xu Yahui was seriously injured and left the field in the twenty-fifth minute. After that, Jinan had to play with only nine players, greatly affecting their strength.</p>
<p>Liu Zukan Equalizes: After a brief break following the first half, Jinan showed great courage in one breath. Although there were only three forwards, each one was imposing and unmatched. Less than six minutes into the second half, winger Liu Zukan invaded the enemy territory, unstoppable, advancing to the corner and unleashing a powerful shot. The ball flew into the corner of the goal, a remarkable feat, with a very beautiful posture. Jinan thus tied the score at 2-2, escaping death and showing great potential for a comeback.</p>
<p>2-3 Agonizing Defeat: After tying the score at 2-2, Jinan's spirits were lifted. The three forwards were eager to try, constantly probing the enemy's stronghold. However, they lacked support and coordination, always feeling a lack of strength. Lancashire continued to attack fiercely, and Kai Zhi repeatedly displayed excellent skills. After about ten more minutes, Jinan's goal was suddenly surrounded, and they were attacked from all sides. Jiang Shanjing and Gu Shang worked tirelessly to defend, but Xu Heng was unable to cover everything. Thus, even the wisest man can make a mistake. In the long run, Lancashire's right inside forward Barnes scored, making the score 3-2. Afterward, Jinan's nine players rearranged their positions from time to time, hoping to make a desperate effort. However, they were outnumbered and lacked the strength, and they had no choice but to suffer a heartbreaking 3-2 defeat.</p>

<p>| The situation was consistently tense, with little to differentiate the teams.</p>
<p>| Liangjiang Gains Victory with the Final Free Throw</p>
<p>Final Score: Twenty-Six to Twenty-Five</p>
<p>The New Zhejiang Construction Games opened yesterday at the Hangzhou Provincial Stadium. The first match was a women's basketball exhibition, with Liangjiang winning against Southeast by one point with a score of twenty-six to twenty-five. In the last three minutes, both teams had scored twenty-five points each. In the final minute, Liangjiang's Yang Sen scored a free throw, which decided the victory. Southeast's Sun Yuxiu was also awarded a free throw before the end, but the ball missed the basket, resulting in a narrow one-point defeat, much to their regret. In terms of strength and performance, the two teams were evenly matched. The excitement and tension were rarely seen. The referee was Shu Hong.</p>
<p>Aircraft Show Before the match, students from the Central Aviation School in Qiaoli were asked to pilot two aircraft, soaring up and down around the stadium, sometimes high and sometimes low, either soaring straight into the clouds or plunging down, tumbling and performing various stunning maneuvers. Color leaflets were scattered temporarily, causing a scramble to grab them.</p>
<p>Hall Director Kicks Off It was not until 10:30 AM that Zeng Yangfu, the Director of the Construction Department, performed the opening kickoff ceremony. Approximately five to six hundred spectators were present. Director Zeng tossed the ball up, the referee blew the silver whistle, and Liangjiang and Southeast began competing for the ball. Hangzhou Mayor Zhao Zhiyou was also present to watch the game early.</p>
<p>Equal Situation Liangjiang and Southeast mutually attacked and defended, advancing and retreating, circling around. Yang Sen was found to have committed a technical foul. Sun Yuxiu tossed the ball up with both hands, and Southeast opened the scoring with one point. Pan Yueying scored two points with a mid-court long shot, and Southeast's momentum was strong, taking a three-point lead. Liangjiang repeatedly attacked, but Chen Rongming missed two opportunities to shoot under the basket. The ball went into the middle of the court, and Lu Xueqin and Zou Shande fought over the ball. Taking advantage of the situation, the ball rolled under the crotch, and Liangjiang's Chen Rongming intercepted it and went straight in. Lu Xueqin rushed to block it, but the ball went into the basket, and a foul was also called. Liangjiang scored three consecutive points, tying the score.</p>
<p>Liangjiang Takes the Lead Under this tied situation, Southeast continuously used long-range shooting tactics. Countless opportunities were missed, contrary to their wishes. In Pan's dream, Liangjiang exceeded the score by five to three. Pan Yueying tied the score again. However, Chen Rongming and Pan Meng scored again one after another. At the end of the first quarter, Liangjiang won by four points with a score of nine to five.</p>
<p>Amidst Tension After a two-minute break, Southeast fought hard and showed their skills. Pan Yueying and Wang Huizhen each scored a goal, immediately bringing the score back to nine to nine. Liangjiang's Chen Rongming added two more points, but Wang Huizhen did not show weakness, making it eleven to eleven, thirteen to thirteen. Seeing the tense situation, Liangjiang called another timeout, which was their third. Pan Yueying made a free throw, putting Southeast ahead of Liangjiang by one point, fourteen to thirteen. At the end of the first half, Yang Sen scored a goal amidst tight surveillance, putting Liangjiang ahead by one point with a score of fifteen to fourteen.</p>
<p>Tied Score After the lemon break, they decided the winner again. Yang Sen scored a free throw, but Pan Yueying's long shot made it sixteen to sixteen, eighteen to eighteen, twenty to twenty. During these eight minutes, it could be called the era of long-range shooting. It was difficult to develop further due to the excessively tight defense of both sides. The all-accurate shooting skills of both sides caused the entire stadium to marvel and lose color in comparison. At the end of the third quarter, Liangjiang was ahead by two points with a score of twenty-two to twenty.</p>
<p>Another Tie The final eight minutes of the deciding game were the most exciting part of the whole game. Chen Yingming scored three consecutive points, and Liangjiang suddenly took a commanding lead with a score of twenty-five to twenty, creating a winning momentum. However, Wang Huizhen suddenly rose up and made a shot from a diagonal angle twenty feet away from the basket. Then, she went into the basket again. Huang Shuhua defended her, but as the ball entered the net, Huang was called for a foul. Wang Huizhen recovered five points for Southeast, making it twenty-five to twenty-five. The situation suddenly turned into a tie. With two minutes left in the game, the atmosphere was tense, and the whole stadium shouted.</p>
<p>Alas, One Point The outcome of the game was about to be decided in these two minutes. Everyone was flustered and gained nothing. Unfortunately for Southeast, Qin Ruiying, who replaced Lu Xueqin, was suddenly called for a foul. Yang Sen made the free throw. This one point created victory for Liangjiang. However, Southeast's Sun Yuxiu also got a free throw in the last second, but the ball did not go into the net, so she could only sigh in defeat. The game was resolved with a score of twenty-six to twenty-five.</p>
<p>Special Art The performance of both sides, in the cold weather, was so wonderful that it could be called unprecedented for both sides. Liangjiang's forward Chen Rongming was the most agile, flipping over under the basket and tossing the ball backhand, which was indescribably beautiful. Yang Sen was under surveillance, but she was very proud. Southeast's Wang Huizhen stood out, adding a lot of color to the whole team. The tight surveillance of the defenders prevented Liangjiang from entering the basket, which was also a special feature of Southeast.</p>

<p>Tennis Exhibition</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:00 PM, a tennis exhibition was held at the Provincial Stadium's tennis court. Gentlemen and ladies of Hangzhou, impressed by the great names of Lin Baohua and others, there were over a thousand spectators, more than for the women's basketball in the morning. There were three singles matches in total. Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia each won one set. Jiang Daozhang won against Chen Naixin completely, and Yu Tianguang lost to Ouyang Xuhui. Finally, Lin, Zheng, Jiang, and Yu performed doubles in two sets. The audience smiled happily and were very satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia Each One <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>| Three to Six | Six to Four |</p>
<p>The singles match between Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia was the most watched. Lin lost the first set with a score of three to six but won back the second set with a score of six to four.</p>
<p>Baohua Breaks Racket Lin served at the beginning, winning consecutive returns. He continued to win two more games, taking a three-to-zero lead. In the fourth game, Zheng served. The court was still wet after the rain, and the pavement was also slippery. Zheng shot forcefully towards Lin's backhand, and Lin slipped and fell to the ground, breaking two of the strings on his racket. Zheng asked him to change it, offering a Dunlop brand new racket. Lin said he would change it after the end. Who knew that he would lose six consecutive games, and Zheng Zhaojia won the first set with a score of six to three.</p>
<p>Zhaojia Praised Lin won the first game of the second set. Zhaojia then chased up with two to one, taking the lead with three to two. At this point, Lin only had two games. He took the lead with four to three and won back one game with six to four. Lin always had a smile and a great attitude. Both performers went to the extreme. Lin Baohua sometimes played close, sometimes far, sometimes lightly, sometimes heavily, making the audience nervous. Zheng Zhaojia's smashes, jumping up and pressing down heavily, with accurate shots in both corners, his skills were not much lower than Baohua's. He was said to be better than Baohua and it was unexpected that Zheng Zhaojia was so skilled, which was a surprise.</p>

<p>Zeng Yangfu Tries the Ball The Liangjiang Southeast women's basketball exhibition was originally scheduled to start at 10:00 AM. Chairman Zhao Zhiyou arrived at the venue before 9:00 AM to watch the two teams practice, with a beaming smile. Later, because the time had arrived, but honorary chairman Zeng Yangfu, the Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, was late, the event was delayed until 10:30 AM and Zeng was invited to kick off. Zeng has always been interested in this but has been neglecting it for years. Touched by the scene, he became very interested. He picked up the ball and tried to shoot, throwing five or six times, but failed to score. Zeng is tall and fat, and he was wearing a very thick cotton robe, so he was already red-faced and panting.</p>
<p>Referee Strikes Gong The timer for the start of the game used a small gong to signal the athletes to stop. At the end of the second quarter, the timer struck the gong too softly. The Southeast heroines were surrounding the enemy's camp, almost scoring a goal. Fortunately, they did not score, otherwise, there would have been a dispute. The referee Shu Hong, struck the gong hard several times and said, "Why not strike it louder? Otherwise, it will be opened again."</p>
<p>Female Students Amazed There are many middle and above schools for both men and women in Hangzhou. In recent years, they have gradually paid attention to sports and asked physical education professors to step up training. Ball skills have greatly improved, but compared to Shanghai, they are inevitably inferior. This time, hearing that the female students from Liangjiang, Southeast, and other schools, all wanted to see them, so the sports ground was full of ladies, more than half of the audience. Seeing the excitement of the two teams' performances and the tension of the situation, no less than that of men, they were all amazed.</p>
<p>Aircraft Distributes Leaflets At 10:00 AM, the ball game began. The aviation school agreed to the request of the sports meet and sent two aircraft to fly over the venue to distribute leaflets. The pilots made various poses and performed upside-down flights in the air. The audience in the stands cheered loudly. The colorful leaflets flew all over the field, and the audience scrambled to grab them, which was very interesting.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Arrives Quickly Lin Baohua is a tennis star in Shanghai, as famous as Qiu Feihai. He is invincible. This time, he should have met the agreement to perform a competition with Zheng Zhaojia. Yesterday, due to business, he stayed in Shanghai. It was expected that Lin Zheng's singles match could not be held on time, so it was postponed for one day. Unexpectedly, Lin did not want to break the agreement and rushed from Shanghai by China Railway. The conference posted an order announcement before the game, re-listing Lin's name, which can also be said to be keeping faith with the audience.</p>
<p>The Defense Regiment Imposes Martial Law Before the opening of the venue, thirty members of the Hangzhou Voluntary Defense Regiment and ten police officers were specially invited to maintain order. Martial law was imposed at the gate, and those without visiting tickets were not allowed to enter. In the first half of the day, in addition to those sold by schools and bookstores, a total of 1,420 tickets were sold, totaling 2,840 small oceans.</p>

<p>Even More Essential Reading for Young People in the Interior</p>
<p>The "Guidance for University Entrance Examinations" and "Guidance for Middle School Entrance Examinations," published by the Qin Fen Bookstore on Fourth Malu Road in Shanghai, were compiled by Mr. Lu Shaoji, director of the Normal Department of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School.

The former book has a total of six chapters, and the latter has a total of seven chapters. Each chapter is divided into sections.

<h3 id="e152">Gold Standard Prices Rose for Several Days, but Yesterday Began to Reverse and Fall <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Spread ··· Fourteen丨Decline Degree ··· Four</p>
<p>The Peak Appears and Immediately Goes Downstream</p>
<p>Central Bank Opens Cash and the Downward Trend is Slightly Checked</p>
<p>A Quick Sketch of the Entire Process Yesterday, the market gold standard price fell because of the external London large bars near and far shrinking by 1.25, New York silver price also fell by 1.25, British-American and American-British exchange rates fell by 1.375, and telegraphic silver price also fell slightly by 1.25. The exchange market did not see any improvement due to the underlying weakness of the large bars (after the close, the United States tended to buy). Therefore, the opening price of the British exchange rate was the same as the previous closing price, while the opening price of the American exchange rate, although slightly tighter than the previous closing price at the beginning, loosened after the opening, and so did the gold standard price. Although the opening jumped to 833.2 taels, rising to 2.4 taels (another new high price), it immediately went downstream. Large households, seeing that the rising path was blocked, became suspicious of each other. Cheng Feng Yong first sold at 818.8 taels, and then the Guangdong group sold off later. Although new prices were frequently seen, there were many buyers at the top of the market, which was also the case yesterday. High prices have been formed, but it is not known who created this market trend. Although the price has slightly gone downstream, it has not fallen too much. Da De Cheng Fu Yu Yu took the lead, and the exchange market also loosened accordingly, falling to 22.5 taels. Fortunately, the Central Bank came as a pillar in the middle stream and continued to open cash, so it turned peaceful, and the people's hearts were still good. Now, the situation of the whole city will be recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>The Morning Market Goes from High to Low The morning opening was affected by the decline in silver prices, so it opened high at 833.2 taels, an increase of 2.5 taels to 2.4 taels compared to the previous close. Fu Yu and others sold slightly, retreating to 2.2 taels. However, at this time, the people's hearts were still good, so the gold price hovered between 2 taels. When Da De Cheng Tian Feng Yong Lai sold, China-Belgium also sold January at 27 yuan, falling to 30.5 taels. Retail investors slightly paid, rising to 1 tael, and the exchange market trended to loosen by 0.0625, which could be settled in January. Fu Yu Heng Yu Qing Fa Yong sold off, and the price went downstream. Helplessly, the internal market of the banks became harder and harder. HSBC issued January American exchange at 125, and Da De Cheng sold fiercely in the market, falling by 8 taels in ten minutes, falling to 25.2 taels. HSBC listed British exchange unchanged, American exchange shrank by 125, Heng Xing Lai entered, and the price began to turn flat. It was also heard that the Central Bank had news of opening cash, so it rose to 7 taels. However, the exchange market was still loose and excessive. March American exchange at 375 could not be sold, and January American exchange at 1875 could be settled. Tian Feng Yong Heng Yu Ri Chang and others sold off, and then fell by more than 3 taels, to 23.5 taels. Yuan Heng bought bars, and the price rose slightly. At this time, Mitsui sold March American exchange at 4375, and the Central Bank continued to open cash. Heng Xing Tong Feng Heng re-entered, pulling 12 taels. Before long, it fell back, and the exchange market also turned flat. January American exchange at 25 was wanted by the bank, so it improved to 6 taels. Finally, after rising and falling by a few cents, it closed at 25.6 taels. Goods were auctioned at 5.5 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Gradually Returns to Calm The afternoon opening was slightly smaller, at 25 taels. The market situation was very flat. Yuan Chun slightly paid, and the price rose slightly. The exchange market improved. March American exchange at 2125 could be sold, and people's hearts were upward, rising to 7 taels. Bing Xing Fu Yu sold, and the price gradually became unsustainable. However, China-Belgium wanted February American exchange at 3125. Heng Yu Yi Feng Yong Lai entered, gradually reaching 8.2 taels. Heng Xing sold off in the market, and Heng Yu Qing Fa Yong followed suit. Meng telegraphed that Ana rose. Retail investors sold, and in an instant, it went down by 2.7 taels. However, the exchange market did not drive it. The banks made a deal on April American exchange at 275, which was tighter than in the morning. The gold price rebounded and returned to 8 taels. Heng Xing still sold, and it fell again to 36 taels. The transactions of each company were also scattered. Da De Cheng Lai entered and rose to 7.4 taels. Zhi Feng Yong then exited, and it hovered for half an hour, closing at 26.6 taels at 4:30. Goods were auctioned at 7 taels. It was found that the highest price in the city was 833.4 taels, and the lowest price was 823.5 taels, with a difference of 9.9 taels. As a result, it fell back by 4.1 taels compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The Opening Price is Mostly Suppressed by Eight Taels The opening price was calculated as 897.2 taels because HSBC listed American exchange shrinking by 124000, which is in line with the gold standard price. According to the closing price, it was suppressed by about 70 yuan, which is 8 taels more than the previous day. The account price for January was 826 taels, the same price for February, and the subsidy was 823 taels.</p>
<p>The Central Bank Continues to Open More Than 600 Bars of Spot Goods The Central Bank continued to open spot goods of about 600 bars, with prices ranging from 24 to 25 taels, which is about 1 tael cheaper than futures. De Cheng Tong Feng Heng Heng Xing and others acted as agents in the market.</p>
<p>The Volume of Transactions is Still Thin The transaction statistics of the whole city show that Fu Yu, Tian Feng Yong, Bing Xing, Da Xing Yong, Chang Sheng Yong, Qing Fa Yong, Hong Xing, etc. were the sellers, while Fu Chang, Zhao Feng Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Heng, Feng Yong, Hong Li, Heng Xing, Heng Yu, etc. were the buyers. Da De Cheng sold fiercely in the morning and slightly entered in the afternoon. The spot goods companies turned to enter. The Dalian group still had no large transactions. Except for Heng Xing entering more than 200 bars on behalf of customers, Yi Feng also remained on the sidelines. All the February bars, as of the 29th, totaled 18,900 bars, slightly more than before.</p>
<p>The Extra Red Increase of 7.5 Taels The extra red has been calm for days. The Central Bank is willing to reduce the price and open cash, so the price has slightly risen. The increase is 7.5 taels. There are not many transactions in the market. Silver shops sell slightly, and only Ying Feng Heng enters. Transactions are still less than 100 taels.</p>
<p>Swap Trades Go From Boom to Bust Swap trades have been booming for days. Extremes meet, and yesterday there were very few transactions in the market, because each spot goods company learned that the Central Bank was indeed willing to reduce the price and open cash, which was about 2 taels different from futures. Therefore, although Heng Xing was willing to pay, it did not see the price of the previous day (the multiple parties paid 2.5 taels), and only Ying Feng Heng swapped January to February to Heng Xing at a price of 2 taels, about 105 bars. Before long, the Central Bank opened and entered spot goods, and the price difference between spot goods and futures was only more than 1 tael, and swap trades became cold again. Until the afternoon, Ying Feng Heng paid 1 tael to swap January to February to Heng Xing, 175 bars. Finally, Fu Chang and the spot goods company Tong Feng Heng actually made a swap, also for January to February, a total of 420 bars. The speed of the change is truly amazing.</p>

<p>丨Each Has 125 Fluctuations丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's exchange rate, although the London large bar shrank, the base was not good, so the British exchange rate opened at the previous closing price of one shilling and seven and a half pence, already showing signs of weakness. Afterwards, it was known in advance that the listing was unchanged, and the gold price fell, becoming more and more loose. After entering, it was flat. The New York silver price also fell by 125, the British-American and American-British exchange rates also fell by 1.375, and the bank's private telegrams were also small by 125, so the opening was slightly tight, but extremely dazed. Recent calculations of 27 yuan or 26 yuan 9375, plus far-term silver market, although the fall was not much, and the last month, the downward trend was more murderous, and the gold price turned back, so the American exchange rate was also loose. Although the listing was only 125, the general trend was gone, and it was no help. The banks were mutually pulling and plugging. As a result, the British exchange rate hardened by 125 compared to the previous close, and the American exchange rate was flat. The whole day had 125 rises and falls.</p>

<p>This year's commercial market is sluggish, and after the January 28th National Crisis, the market's depression lasted for nearly half a year before it slightly improved in the second half of the year. However, because the financial community was unwilling to lend money as much as possible, the commercial market that wanted to be revitalized but was not, experienced an economic panic. As a result, at the year-end major closing period, there was still no significant transaction. Therefore, this year's total summary situation is far less prosperous than in previous years. However, the market is still peaceful, without any major disturbances, which is fortunate.</p>
<p>Foreign Cent Price is Flat, Transaction is Weak, Silver Rate Follows Old Rules The early market cent price for "foreign cents" was seven qian one fen one li six hao two hu and a half. The afternoon market was unusually sluggish, so transactions were also declining. The "silver discount" was two fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, which was still the same as the previous day's market price. However, the situation was loose, so it was either two fen or white borrowing for days. The silver head adding water had no market yesterday.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Minor Coin Rises Madly in the Afternoon, Copper Coins Mostly Lengthen The Jiangnan minor coin was six qian three fen in the early market, an increase of two li compared to the previous day.

The Guangdong minor coin was six qian one fen four li in the early market and five and a half li in the afternoon market. Although the price difference between the two markets was one and a half li, it seemed to be 1.5 li lower than the price in the afternoon market of the previous day. The transaction was 60,000 corners in the early market and 75,000 corners in the afternoon market. Copper coins lengthened by 1,500 wen, to 393,500 thousand wen, with transactions of 40,530 thousand and 500 wen, totaling 10,300 taels.</p>
<p>Both Silver and Foreign Currency Transactions are Rare, Silver Settlement is More, Foreign Currency is Less Yesterday's "silver fund" bank settlement news, because it was only one day away from New Year's Eve, the year-end closing procedures needed to be sorted out urgently, so the situation was very tight. Chinese merchant settlement votes were 3.45 million, foreign merchants were more than 2.1 million, special funds were more than 50,000, settlement funds were more than 6 million, foreign exchange funds were more than 500,000, advance funds were more than 2 million, fund redemption was 1.45 million, and various goods exchange tax collection was 9.45 million.

<p>Yesterday (30th), the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the spot market was very good, and the prices in the futures market were also generally peaceful. The market was relatively calm, and with the end of the national account period approaching, major players were watching and there were not many transactions. Although retail investors were not lonely, there were also no huge transactions. Especially since various prices had fallen too much in recent days, scattered needs seemed to dominate, and the price generally hovered and trended upward. As a result, it rebounded by about 8 jiao more than the previous day, only 1 jiao for 96 and Jin Chang. The February issue of the 20th roll fell by nearly 1 yuan compared to before delivery because there were no transactions yesterday. The closing situation is good, but the end of the year is approaching, and the exchange will be closed for many days, so today's situation may be even more stable. The total spot transaction for the whole day was 31,000 yuan, of which more than 10,000 yuan were unified salt tax, and the rest were only several thousand yuan. The front and rear market transactions in futures were each about 2.7 million, totaling 5.38 million yuan, of which salt tax accounted for 1.5 million, which was more, unified tax was more than 900,000 yuan, and the others were clearer.</p>

<p>(Cotton Yarn) The spot market situation for cotton yarn is quite good. Because people are optimistic, it is generally expected that there will be a new atmosphere after the New Year, and the red market in the spring will likely improve. Therefore, the number of doers is increasing day by day. Today, the American cotton telegram also rose, which helped, and the market situation was even stronger. Standard yarn will handle delivery procedures at the end of the month and will be closed for one day. It has been found that the statistics of the various groups buying are 786 bales, and the market conditions have risen by five qian to one tael. From tomorrow, the spot market will also be closed, and business will resume as usual on January 4, 1933. The number of bales bought by each group is listed on the left.</p>

<p>A Concise Review from the Beginning to Delivery</p>
<p>Residual Bale Amount of Yarn is 6,700 Bales</p>
<p>Only 1,200 Bales Were Actually Delivered</p>
<p>The Standard Yarn of December was launched in early July at a price of 143-4 taels. Later, due to the bad weather of American cotton and serious insect pests, the market price rose. At the same time, a certain yarn company in the Guangdong group searched for cash in the market, and Standard Yarn Rong Xing purchased it, so the rising wind became more and more fierce. In August, the highest price once reached 157-8 taels. Unexpectedly, the American cotton government estimated twice and fell by more than 100 pounds, and the world cotton market crashed and turned down, with a tendency to be out of control. Standard yarn went straight from 56-7 taels to below 50 taels. The Rong Xing bulls struggled hard, but the trend was such that a single tree could not support the building. Yarn from Shanxi and Hebei sought a way out in Shanghai, and the market has since slumped, hovering at a low peak of 46-7 taels. In the autumn, there is usually an autumn sales development, but this year the domestic harvest is called abundant, but the selling price of agricultural products is meager, and the livelihood of farmers is still poor. Yarn sales are equal to despair, so the accumulation of various yarns in Shanghai is increasing day by day, about 120,000 to 130,000 bales. Therefore, at the beginning of December, the low peak was 138 taels. Then, due to the scarcity of cotton from various sources and the impact of the gold market on foreign cotton, the purchase was not smooth, and there was a short squeeze. The market price suddenly rose, and the tired yarn market suddenly saw vitality. The foreign groups had been quiet for a long time and thought about moving. They took a look at the situation and moved to purchase about 20,000 to 30,000 bales. Standard yarn went out of 40 taels and reached a maximum of 44.6 taels. At the same time, the financial community entered January and exited February and March, making arbitrage transactions, about 7,000 to 8,000 bales. The market situation has been hard in recent months. As a result, the last plate was 142.7 taels, with a residual of 6,700 bales, and the delivery price was 142 taels. Only 1,200 bales were actually delivered, and the rest were self-delivered. The goods were 20-count C採花200 bales, 龍船400 bales, 人鐘 150 bales, 松鶴 450 bales. The brokerage number and bale amount for receiving and delivering goods are listed below.</p>

<p>Residual Amount of Cotton is 26,900 Dan Actual Delivery Counted as 21,000 Dan Goods Aspect Shaanxi Cotton is the Most</p>
<p>The Standard Cotton of December started to be listed in July, at 30 taels 12 qian. Then, due to the change in the weather of American cotton and the spread of insect pests, the American cotton government estimated on August 8 that the production would be reduced, and the market price soared by more than 80 pounds. The market price rose accordingly, and the highest price in August was more than 35 taels. Later, the second American cotton estimate was released on September 8, with a drop of more than 100 pounds. The world cotton market was greatly shocked and plummeted. At the same time, a certain manufacturer estimated that the domestic climate was favorable and cotton production increased, and a large amount of cotton was thrown out in the Standard Cotton market, with the amount accumulating to more than 200,000 dan. Therefore, the market atmosphere was quite precarious, and the lowest peak in November was 30 taels and 005 fen. After the lack of supply from various sources, the climate of Huamian in August and September was not good, and there was too much rain in the north, and the Yellow River burst its banks, and cotton production was greatly damaged. The production was reduced from 10,829,162 dan to 8,094,863 dan, and people were even more nervous. In addition, a part of the cotton saw that a certain manufacturer had thrown out a large amount of cotton, and the position was short on delivery, and the short squeeze became special. The market price has been rising day by day, and the highest price has reached 33 taels and 5 qian and a half. As for the seller, seeing the turbulent situation, the seller searched for and bought more than 10,000 bales of Xihua coarse velvet cotton in Tianjin and came to Shanghai for delivery. When the news was broadcast on the business market, the market situation changed suddenly and fell back by 1 tael. However, several factories were determined to receive the goods, and the coarse velvet cotton had not yet arrived, and the market price gradually went up again, and even reached 2 taels. As a result, the last plate was 32 taels and 7 qian, and the delivery price was 33 taels. The remainder was 26,900 dan, and the actual delivery was 21,000 dan. The most of the goods was Shaanxi cotton, and the most of 火機 was 2,000 dan. The most of the receiving goods was Puyi Factory and Tongdi Company, and the exclusive supplier was Xincheng. The brokerage and brand numbers of the two parties receiving and delivering goods are listed below.</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, there were more sources, reaching more than 60 ships. Retail sales were smoother, and urban and rural store customers were actively purchasing because their New Year's store stock was insufficient. 包栈胃 Tianjin Group continued to pour in, selling Tong稻船头念八号, totaling more than 3,000 shi. Therefore, the market conditions soared, Su Tong Group rose by a corner and a half, Chang Group high goods rose by a corner, and Zhongguan goods rose by two corners. As for 南港青角 and other groups, the Zhongguan goods rose by two corners and five cents, and the high goods increased by more than a corner. Early rice also rose by a corner, 變元 rose by two corners. 阴元’s sales went slack due to the wine jug group’s slack sales, and the price only increased by five cents. There was still a lack of 洋杜尖 arrivals, and the price also rose by one corner and five cents. Looking back at the accumulated stock in Puzhong, although it is thick, the inventory has decreased with the recent smooth retail sales. If there are fewer ships arriving in the future and sales continue, then the price is expected to rise.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, more than 40 ships arrived from down the river. The white粳堆 household still bought, and retail sales were flat. The price was stable. Zhongci increased by nearly a chi. The high goods of 杜埠尖 were scarce, and Zhongci sales were good, and the price was also firm. Yin Yuan arrived in small quantities and sales were active, Bai Yuan and 羊尖 prices increased by about a chi. 薄稻 also increased by a few cents, and the 客尖 had no glory or disgrace.</p>

<p>丨Fufeng Opened to 2 Taels, Exceeding Standard Flour丨</p>
<p>After the standard flour stopped trading, the spot goods still went out extremely smoothly. The closing price for December was 1 tael 5 qian 8 fen, and the closing price for January was 1 tael 9 qian 1 fen. The spot flour asking price was because the 客帮 demand was very strong, and the factories naturally raised the price. It is heard that Fufeng opened to 2 taels (but there is very little spot flour, and it is also difficult to ship from 木街), and Shen Da Huafeng and others opened to 1 tael 9 qian 8 fen, one is already exceeding December, and the other is already equal to the December standard. This kind of situation is really unexpected. (On the 29th, Fu Fu and other factories opened 170,000 bags again, which were handled by the North and South Ocean groups) Therefore, when the January market opens, it is feared that the extreme tightness of the spot goods will continue to be high.</p>

<p>Fujianese merchants continue to clear stock at lower prices... Small glutinous rice also sees transactions. Yesterday, imported Yuan rice and Xiang rice were sluggish in sales. Due to merchants from the north and south shifting to river-bottom rice, sales came to a standstill. Customer Yuan rice, despite its excellent quality and popularity among local customers, saw customers shifting to river-bottom Du Yuan rice due to the rising prices of Customer Yuan rice since last week, which attracted transporters. In the past two days, as many as five or six thousand bags arrived. Fujianese merchants took the opportunity to depress prices. Yesterday morning, Wuhu Yuan rice opened at a sudden drop of twenty or thirty cents. The price continued to fall in the afternoon, more than fifty cents lower than the opening price a few days ago. Xiang Yuan rice also dropped thirty or forty cents. The general market opened with 150 bags of Hunan machine-milled rice, priced at $9.90. 2,163 bags of Wuhu machine-milled rice opened at $10.03 in the morning, then dropped to $10.01 or $10.02, and further down to $9.90 in the afternoon. Zhongguan cargo dropped to $9.50. With ample stock arriving, the market is expected to remain soft. The market continued to offer 100 bags of old small glutinous rice, which were still cleared by the local market at $7.65, the same as the previous market price.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to the upcoming five-day customs closure and the guild's decision to close the market for two days on January 1st and 2nd, trading at the guild was extremely quiet. Only 200 bags of second-grade granulated white sugar were traded in the afternoon at $15.88875, slightly down by 1.25 cents from the previous day. The remaining stock saw few transactions. Due to strong sales of new Chao Qing sugar in recent days, local prices have soared. According to telegrams, high-quality sugar has risen to $17, equivalent to about $9.30 per picul in Shanghai, exceeding Shanghai's price by twenty or thirty cents, creating a reverse situation. The market is expected to be volatile.</p>

<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Since I was little, I rarely had the opportunity to meet my father. I feared him as if he were a fierce god. So, until now, whenever I imagine his face in my mind, I can't even remember an outline. But once, his face was always vividly present in my heart. The impression was extremely negative. After our family's first bankruptcy, I had just been admitted to middle school. My father, under the severe blow, even struggled with our brothers' tuition fees. My uncle agreed to bear this burden, but my uncle was also a typical miserly rich man. So, on the night before my brother and I entered school, Father called us to his side and asked us about all the fees that should be paid. He allocated the various expenses according to the most stringent policy. We knew that his allocation was not enough, but we didn't dare to speak. My brother was even more afraid of him than I was. Finally, regarding the money for buying bedsheets, I plucked up the courage to stand behind him and said, "At least two sheets should be bought for replacement." This made him angry. He turned his head sharply and glared at me with a ferocious look, saying, "You want to buy a hundred sheets!" This kind of ferocious appearance and voice was always imprinted in my heart afterward. I tried many times to shake off this memory, but I never succeeded, because I believed that perhaps no human father had ever shown such a frighteningly ferocious face to his child.</p>
<p>But my father was an extremely capable man. With the help of my uncle's power, he soon revived his family business. However, like a flash in the pan, it immediately encountered a second, more dangerous storm. After this time, my father could never rise again, and our family gradually fell into the deep abyss of poverty.</p>
<p>Fortunately, when our family could still support it, I decisively left the country and ran to Japan.</p>
<p>Not a day would make me feel at ease. Whenever I thought of my family, that unfortunate family!</p>
<p>In addition to the economic storms, my family was often quarreling. My father, in his most proud moment, married a concubine, which my mother found out about. My mother wanted to commit suicide and become a nun, but we finally restrained her. But this family, from then on, became a repair shop. In the middle of the night, we brothers often woke up from our dreams, trembling with fear, listening to my mother's screams and curses or the sound of things being thrown.</p>
<p>No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't escape this bewilderment. After I had lived in Japan for two years, one night, I had such a dream:</p>
<p>"I seemed to have returned to my unfortunate family again.</p>
<p>The home was two cramped rooms. The room smelled of filth. A broken bed, a square table, two chairs, and nothing else.</p>
<p>My brother was groaning on the bed, his face pale, like a dying man.</p>
<p>My younger brother! That poor child who was suffering from an unhappy family, was crying on the square table.</p>
<p>My father, frowning, wandered around the open space in the room. Mother sat by the bed, screaming and cursing.</p>
<p>Like a flash of sparks, they fought together. I wanted to stop my mother, but she became even more angry and bit me on the arm."</p>
<p>I woke up from my dream with a painful cry. At this time, a faint dawn was appearing in the foreign sky. A child whose emotions were barren actually had tears welling up in his eyes. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e185">Forgetting 1932 <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Du Heng</p>
<p>Today is the last day of 1932, which means tomorrow is New Year's Day. However, recently, we Chinese people are not celebrating the New Year. This is not entirely because the people's livelihood has been plagued recently, and everything has been destroyed, so that even a 'New Year's Eve dinner' is unaffordable for a family. There are still quite a few people willing to spend three yuan to see Dr. Mei's play. We Chinese people are putting aside the New Year and celebrating the old year. If you try to innovate and buy a pig's head today and prepare to invite the gods, then, 'Are you celebrating the solar New Year?' People who see it will definitely ask you this question in surprise.</p>
<p>The person who asks this question certainly won't feel that he has committed a serious crime of despising government decrees: not to mention anything else, the two words 'solar calendar' are simply misused, he should say 'national calendar'.</p>
<p>This national calendar was originally promoted by our revolutionary government with decisive revolutionary measures. At that time, the effort spent was indeed not small, at least much greater than the effort used this year to deal with the Japanese imperialist armed invasion. When it comes to the facilities and innovations in recent years, this point really has the right to be listed as number one. Unfortunately, this national calendar is probably because it is not a genuine domestic product, so probably at least 300 million out of our 400 million compatriots are still not used to it. For example, when it comes to celebrating the New Year, I am afraid that at least 300 million people are celebrating the old year: as for the New Year, I am afraid that they can't even remember it.</p>
<p>For example, me. Although I may not be so outdated that I can't even remember it, if I weren't holding a pen today to find a topic to write an article, then I'm afraid I would have forgotten this New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Speaking of forgetting, 1932 was indeed a year in which the Chinese people showed the most forgetfulness. From our respected officials to the lowly servants, almost everyone has forgotten that 1932 was born in the flames of war: compared to this, the matter of whether to celebrate the New Year or not, mentioned earlier, is really insignificant. Really, why should we keep these things in our hearts? The flames of war are far away. Even though science is developed, a cannon that can transmit sound as far as three thousand miles has never been invented. We don't have super-hearing. Naturally, we are left in peace: even if there is a radio to replace super-hearing, all that is heard on the radio is the sound of opera and music, and there is still a peaceful scene in our ears. We are still left in peace, peace and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Okay, let's forget 1932 along with everything about it. Let it pass quietly, and what awaits us is, of course, a prosperous and peaceful 1933.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Faith in Turbulent Times <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Donghua</p>
<p>In turbulent times, there is much faith; in turbulent times, there is no faith. Much faith is equal to no faith. If someone asks me if I have faith, I say yes, yes, yes:</p>
<p>I believe the Earth is round.</p>
<p>I believe the whole is greater than the part, and the part is smaller than the whole.</p>
<p>I believe seven times seven equals forty-nine, and seven plus seven equals fourteen.</p>
<p>I believe all humans die.</p>
<p>I believe you can't have a son without sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>I believe chanting scriptures and spells cannot save the country.</p>
<p>I believe I would rather die than trust myself.</p>
<p>··································</p>
<p>Faith and superstition are originally sisters, so many people mistakenly recognize superstition as faith.</p>
<p>How can belief become superstition?</p>
<p>I have a friend who returned from the United States studying "Leadership Skills" (ＡitofLeadrsh　). He told me, "If the ×× government gives me five hundred yuan every month, I will be superstitious about ××ism." This is truly a golden saying, hitting the nail on the head!</p>
<p>What is known as American "Leadership Skills" is the art of using five hundred yuan, fifty yuan, or even five yuan, five jiao, five fen symbols, to make people superstitious. A leader without followers cannot be a leader. Leaders each lead their followers worth five hundred, fifty, five yuan, five jiao, five fen, and fight with other leaders, and therefore the world is in chaos.</p>
<p>In turbulent times, there is no faith, only the faith of the leader, and the leader's faith is the cause of chaos.</p>
<p>If people each believe in the truth and do not believe in leaders, then the world will be peaceful.</p>
<p>However, these five hundred, fifty, even five yuan, five jiao, five fen are so necessary and reluctant to give up, then is chaos the destiny of mankind! It is said that it lies in education.</p>
<p>(Note: My opinion is roughly the same as Mr. Qi Fan's "Rejecting Geniuses," but I cannot agree with Mr. Qi Fan's "Honoring Ignorance." Because one of the main factors of genius is the ignorance of others.)</p>
<h3 id="e187">Suzhou Impression (Continued) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Fu</p>
<p>It plays low music, it plucks the faint strings, just this quiet and beautiful place is enough to make people yearn for it. It is the spring in the mountain, it will never flow out of the mountain, of course it can maintain its permanent purity.</p>
<p>After we came out of the Bowl Spring, we went to the mountain. The stone steps on the mountain are cleverly built from the original stones. The mountain road is winding, and occasionally wild flowers and weeds hold onto our clothes, warning us not to move forward; is it that natural scenery is not allowed for people to peep at? Is it afraid of the danger above? But we finally ignored them and bravely moved forward. Strange rocks are everywhere, all seem to have been carved by supernatural craftsmanship, some standing upright, seeming very dignified, some lying down, expressing a different kind of leisure, some wearing green moss coats, some wearing red and green small flowers, some like wounded beasts, with many scars carved on their bodies, making angry shapes. As we advanced, a large rock stood across the road, and we had to lower our heads and pass under it. Some stood towering into the sky, blocking the way, and we had to change direction. At one place, a large rock suddenly split into two, and we had to proceed in the crack, which is the so-called One-Line Sky. Above the mountainside, there are no paths anymore. We climbed over the rocks, clung to the kudzu vines, and after many twists and turns, we finally reached the top of the mountain. On the top of the mountain, we can see the undulating peaks within Suzhou, we can see the faint Taihu Lake, we can see the crisscrossing fields and the orderly houses, as if doing an aerial view. Because we had to hurry to catch the boat to Mudu, unfortunately we couldn't stay long and hurried down the mountain. The maple trees at the foot of the mountain, although only a part of them gradually turned red, the small maple leaves on the ground are already very red, like a child who has just drunk wine, and is so ashamed to see strangers, this is how lovely red it is! This is worth praising and singing. We picked many branches, carried the sun, stepped on the rustling grass, and returned in the nodding of the reeds and the natural songs played by the branches. Below is a poem commemorating Tianping Mountain:</p>
<p>The grotesque rocks are truly frightening, all stationed in Tianping. If Mi Fu came to this mountain, he should bow down every step. It is a pity that the maple leaves are just beginning to turn red, all the spirituality is concentrated here. Diligently pick one branch after another. How can it compare to the red beans, which are the most missed. Tune: Yu Meiren</p>
<p>When we arrived at Mudu, the boat had already left a few minutes ago, only a few minutes. But what else can we do? So we started walking, from Mudu to Suzhou, only twenty-seven miles, it shouldn't be difficult to walk.</p>
<p>The sunset gradually faded, from a white color to a golden color, faintly laid on the ground, grass, and branches. When its light spread to the water surface, part of it was taken away by the sailing boats; part of it laid on the water surface was disturbed by the sound of oars and ripples, stirring into thousands of points of light, shining into people's eyes. We walked with our backs to the sun, along the bank, in this golden world, how happy it is!</p>
<p>We walked to Hengtang, which made us miss Chen Yuanyuan of the late Ming Dynasty. Didn't Wu Meicun tell us clearly, "In a past life, I should have been a lotus picker, with a piece of Hengtang water in front of my door"? Didn't he also tell us, "The double oars of Hengtang fly like wings, where did a rich family forcibly take her away"? We look at this piece of Hengtang碧water, and imagine the situation of Yuanyuan at that time, isn't it enough for us to savor? Let's put together a few sentences as a memorial:</p>
<p>The water of Hengtang碧is as clear as Xu, only remembering the companions washing silk. Suddenly passing by and turning back, the fragrant grass and slanting sun are melancholy in the east of the water. Where are the traces of Yuanyuan's beauty, the maple leaves are cold on the Wu River. May the fragrant soul not return under the moon, the beacon of Shenzhou is still urging the chaos. Tune: Yu Meiren</p>
<p>While we were lingering in Hengtang, the sun was secretly taken away by the shadows of the sails, and carried away by the water flow. The only part we were carrying on our backs was also taken away by the crows returning to their nests. Fortunately, Chang'e's silver lamp has already hung high, so we have turned from the golden sunlight into the world of bell light, allowing us to experience the quiet night world, this is such a fortunate thing! In the starry lights, we smiled and returned to Suzhou.</p>
<p>Shanghai, December 11, 1932</p>
<h3 id="e188">"Watching" and "Escaping" <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Gangfu</p>
<p>"Watching" and "escaping" are the two signature moves of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>From marrying a bride, carrying a coffin, copying targets, fighting, to two yellow dogs having sex in the street, it will always stir up some idlers to watch with relish: when there is a big fire, it is even more lively, people rush to watch from all directions, and it is not surprising that people die.</p>
<p>However, if you hear that the fire has burned through the electric wires along the road, a group of people will immediately turn around and run away, showing their ability to escape, which is also inevitable.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there are also clever friends who simply combine "watching" and "escaping" into one, and things become a bit comical, just like during the Shanghai war, when Japanese ronin were showing off their power on North Sichuan Road, a large group of Chinese people were watching, and when the ronin waved their leather whips, the Chinese people ran away while watching.</p>
<p>Even regarding national affairs, the Chinese people are no different: the volunteers are fighting bloody battles in the frozen wilderness outside the Guan, but the people inside the Guan are like watching the Three Iron Roosters, watching how it ends around the stove: once the Japanese army arrives in Shanghai, they are at a loss like dogs without a home, running away with their heads in their hands.</p>
<p>However, although watching a fire from across the river is not a virtue, and standing under a collapsing wall is certainly not the way of a gentleman, how can the land of Chinese etiquette be without gentlemen?</p>
<p>Therefore, someone said: China is going to perish because the Chinese people only know how to "watch", but the Chinese will not become extinct because the Chinese people know how to "escape"!</p>
<h3 id="e189">Year-End Melancholy <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The north wind roars, and the earth returns to spring. This harsh and cold end of winter is about to say goodbye to us.</p>
<p>Walking into the house, looking at the calendar of 1932 on the wall, only a few thin pages are left; walking into the street, the bustling figures and the New Year lanterns are shining in my eyes, startling me, telling me everywhere that it is the end of the year, the end of 1932.</p>
<p>It's strange, people always seem to be busy with farewells at the end of the year. Everyone can't help but have all kinds of emotions, and I'm not very clear about what these emotions contain. Are they reluctant to leave these few remaining days? Are they pinning their hopes on the future New Year? However, theoretically speaking, the latter is more than the former, right? Why still be reluctant to leave this cursed year of 1932? We naturally look forward to the New Year, 1933!</p>
<p>So, you see: aren't the fortune-tellers by the roadside already writing spring couplets with "National Prosperity and People's Peace" and "Good Harvest of the Five Grains"? They are prepared to hang them up together when the New Year comes, which is a sign of hope for the future. This year's financial luck is not good, so everyone hopes to make a fortune next year, this year's official luck is not "prosperous," so everyone hopes to be promoted next year, this year's frequent internal and external troubles, so everyone hopes to turn them into "National Prosperity and People's Peace." In this way, people are all looking forward to the beautiful New Year that is about to come, so why would they be willing to be reluctant to leave these smoggy remaining years?</p>
<p>I don't think so. It's not that I don't have hope, but I often hope for the "future," but as a result, the future makes me fall into the sorrow of disappointment. In the end, the "future" is often not as good as the past. Therefore, if the facts of the past continue like this forever, I will no longer have any hope.</p>
<p>Wasn't everyone eagerly hoping for "last year" at the end of the year before last? However, now let's try to look back at last year, in which aspect has it progressed compared to the year before last? The Northeast was lost, floods were rampant, and famines were caused by crop failures. How can "last year" compare to the year before last? At the end of last year, everyone was grieving over the humiliation of September 18th, wishing to send the unlucky "1931" away as soon as possible, and pinning their hopes on this year. Who knew that as soon as the New Year passed, the Shanghai War would break out, there would be internal strife everywhere, and even a bumper harvest would become a disaster. How can this year compare to last year? Year after year, it gets worse and worse, this is an ironclad fact! If this continues, I really don't have any hope for the future New Year! Therefore, I feel a sense of reluctance towards this dying end of the year.</p>
<p>Another year has passed! Let's not be extravagant about the New Year, let's look back on this year that is about to end from the beginning. December 24, 1932.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>I·······I, I······I·······</p>
<p>He said the word "I" several times in succession, and hurriedly circled around again and walked into the fourth alley. Standing at the kitchen door of the last house, waiting for him with a smile, wasn't that petite and lively Zhuo Shuhua?</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, sorry, it's cold tonight."</p>
<p>"It's okay."</p>
<p>He didn't expect that Zhuo Shuhua would actually reach out her palm to shake his hand. What surprised him was that her hands were as cold as his, and it seemed that his were a little warmer than hers.</p>
<p>He stepped in through the back door. He saw that the kitchen was unusually untidy, with two or three small coal stoves lined up horizontally or vertically. Two women in dirty clothes were washing dishes under the dim electric light.</p>
<p>(14)</p>
<p>Led by Zhuo Shuhua, Haiquan walked into the front building on the upper floor of their house. As soon as he stepped into the room, he suddenly heard a melodious piano sound.</p>
<p>"Do you have a piano at home?"</p>
<p>Haiquan asked Ms. Zhuo.</p>
<p>"No. That's next door."</p>
<p>There was no one in the front building, and there was no cold-proof equipment. He walked in. He still felt a gust of cold air. The furnishings in this room were not as messy and dirty as the kitchen, but there was no special furniture, just ordinary iron beds, ordinary dressing tables, and ordinary tables and chairs. In the middle of the room, there was a large octagonal table with a plate of red melon seeds and a few teacups on it. What caught his attention the most was that there was a telephone next to the dressing table.</p>
<p>"Please sit down, Mr. Lin."</p>
<p>She greeted him to sit down on a chair in front of the octagonal table, and also took a seat in a direction perpendicular to him. Haiquan seemed very restrained sitting in front of Ms. Zhuo, and was speechless for a while, and didn't dare to look up at her. He forced a smile to reduce his awkwardness.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>She smiled and brought the melon seed plate to him. He unconsciously pinched a few seeds. At that moment, he took the opportunity to look at Zhuo Shuhua. Her face was full of intimate smiles. He thought, this is really enjoyable. Which of the female students in the school doesn't have a big air, where can you find someone as intimate and polite as her.</p>
<p>"Do you live here?"</p>
<p>Haiquan took the opportunity to ask her.</p>
<p>"··················"</p>
<p>She pondered for a moment before nodding.</p>
<p>"······But, Mr. Lin, don't tell any classmates."</p>
<p>"Zhang Yingkui knows?"</p>
<p>"He doesn't know, I didn't tell him."</p>
<p>Her attitude became serious at this moment, and she restrained her smile.</p>

<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>In this era of famine, unemployment, riots, and full of contradictions, the 1.6 billion people around the world who hope that God will save them are celebrating this "Christmas Festival" madly. Indeed, the words in the Bible are very touching, and the turkey is so delicious, and the Christmas village is so beautiful. Even the soldiers in armor, except for the Sichuan generals who do not believe in Jesus, must welcome it for one day. No wonder the Pope of Rome considers it "gratifying." If you don't believe it, please read the news.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 23rd - The governments of Paraguay and Bolivia have notified the Pope of Rome, stating that they are willing to abide by the Pope's proposal for a Christmas truce. Therefore, from 10 pm on Christmas Eve to 10 pm on Christmas night, the war in the Chaco Forest will be suspended. The Pope expressed his gratification at this and hoped that this move could lead to lasting peace between the two countries.</p>
<p>Shells flying, flesh and blood flying away, is originally a terrible sight. If on the "Christmas Festival" and still exchange with artillery fire, wouldn't it be a great scenery. Make people suspect that God no longer cares about things on the ground. How could this be allowed. Therefore, for 波巴.</p>
<p>The 24-hour ceasefire between the two countries, not only God's representative, 丨 the Pope, "expressed gratification," but also me, who is far away and gets no benefits and suffers no hardships, also considers it "gratifying." What I find gratifying is that Jesus, who died more than a thousand years ago and is worshiped by millions of people, still has some slight effect, and it is more than just the damned souls of the two countries that can prolong their remaining lives by one day. What a pity is that the ceasefire time is only "24 hours," and "eternal peace" is just a "hope."</p>
<p>Speaking of the "hope" of "peace," we have been harboring it for a long time. Counting from the first Christmas to today, there have been one thousand nine hundred and thirty-two Christmases. Morning and night, recited in the mouths of pastors, and heard in the ears of the people, it has never seemed to be taken seriously. However, the two words "brotherly love" are still an unfulfilled check, and society seems to have not improved at all compared to the time when Jesus preached two thousand years ago. On the contrary, it has worsened. We still remember when the World War broke out in 1914, didn't the priests of various countries shout "Fight for God" and "Fight for Justice"? But who is fighting for God and who is fighting for justice, we are still at a loss today. Only this batch of damned heroic lives were wasted by ambitious people. This time, more than ten million deaths and 22.34 million yuan (US dollars) in war expenses cannot but call on God to bear part of the consumption responsibility.</p>
<p>Originally, hoping for "peace" can never be achieved by empty words, and "brotherly love" is also quite limited. Catholics will never love Christians, and Baptists will never worship Methodists. This is still believing in the same God. Not to mention the hostility towards pagans. The "Non-Aggression Pact" is just a decoration between countries, and the "Bible" is just a "nonsense." When attacking the weak, it can be used to anesthetize the other party's will, such as "If someone strikes you on the right cheek, offer the left as well," a kind of narcotic. When encountering the strong, it is completely ineffective without politeness. You must fight clearly. Never come. To be tempted by your sweet words. Therefore, after singing "brotherly love" for more than nineteen hundred years, a world-wide bloodshed is still unavoidable, and it is inevitable to enslave people. The reason is that we are trying to achieve the end without understanding the root cause. Therefore, things of slapping oneself in the face are discovered from time to time. Taking a step back, if "justice" is really maintained by the priests, then this group of people who eat "God's rice" are really too irresponsible. They will definitely not be saved after death.</p>
<p>Mussolini said, "Empty words are beautiful, but rifles and cannons are more beautiful." Wilson said, "Justice must be backed by force." People who hope to be saved, listen! Amen.</p>

<h3 id="e192">How to Make Alcohol from Sweet Potatoes and Corn <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Shun Ji</p>
<p>(1) How to make alcohol from sweet potatoes: Wash the sweet potatoes carefully, put them on a pot, steam them over water, cut them into thin slices with a knife, and then put them in a stone mortar and mash them with a pestle; when the temperature is slightly lower, about 120 degrees Fahrenheit, mix in the crushed wheat sprouts, and then inject hot water to make it a thin liquid; then wait for it to cool, pour it into a bag made of cotton cloth, squeeze out the sugar juice, and let the sugar juice drip into the barrel; then separately use yeast with fermentation effect, after one day, countless small bubbles will appear on the surface of the sugar juice, and later gradually decrease and cannot float; then pour it into a distiller, steam it into gas, and when it meets cold, it gradually condenses and turns into liquid again, this liquid is called alcohol. (2) How to make alcohol from corn: Peel the corn from the cob, and then put it in a stone mortar and then crush it; add 20 pounds of water and 3-4 pounds of dilute sulfuric acid to every 100 pounds of corn flour, and mix it evenly with a pestle; then put it on a pot and steam it to make it like a paste; after it cools, put it in a mill and grind it, and mix in the crushed wheat sprouts; after a few hours, pour in hot water, then it will turn into a sweet sugar liquid; then filter the sugar liquid in a fine filter, add wine koji made from wheat; after one or two days, the sugar liquid gradually ferments, the small bubbles produced are very numerous at first, and gradually decrease later; when no small bubbles float out, steam it into gas again, and then let it gradually cool down, and after it cools down, it turns into liquid again, this is alcohol. The uses of alcohol: Because alcohol is a fragrant, colorless liquid that is easily soluble in various medicines, it is used as a solvent for manufacturing fake paint, perfume, and iodine tincture. Its nature is easy to burn, and the heat is also strong, so it is used for lighting lamps; and the newly invented alcohol iron is used to iron clothes, and it also has the function of preservation, animals and plants are immersed in alcohol and do not rot for a long time. From this, the function of alcohol can be seen, and its function can also be imagined.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Serious and Difficult Problems <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhang Yiyuan's communication "Falling Ill After Entering a Shop" on the 24th of this month, I feel very sympathetic. The problem he raised is a very important social problem, not a simple trivial matter, so it is worth discussing by everyone. I believe the editor's response to Mr. Zhang cannot satisfy Mr. Zhang's requirements: first, it did not point out the reason why Mr. Zhang is unhealthy; second, the solutions proposed by the editor are not practically feasible for Mr. Zhang.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang himself said: "Since entering the old-fashioned shop, I have been gradually losing weight involuntarily." Here, I dare to answer: it is because Mr. Zhang has to work more than twelve hours a day, without extra time</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>to rest, resulting in accumulated fatigue and emaciation into illness; naturally, there are also poor treatment and unexpected constraints, such as Mr. Zhang's desire to practice boxing every morning, which is interfered with by the manager, who believes it is unconventional. The rest need not be said.</p>
<p>Indeed, breathing fresh air can strengthen the body. However, Mr. Zhang, in fact, for the sake of his livelihood, for the sake of supporting his family, cannot leave the city or has to struggle desperately for food, or still cannot eat even after being extremely hungry, so how can he talk about moderation in diet! As for what is said about "taking a walk after meals, doing something that makes you happy, and other exercises," only high-class free people have the right to do so. The working-class people who sell their labor, in the current unequal and exploitative society, it is absolutely impossible! If the fundamental problem cannot be solved, singing loudly about the equal importance of physical, moral, and intellectual education, etc., is all in vain.</p>
<p>to the market and then to the countryside. Furthermore, having to rush to shop duties early in the morning, where can the necessary time to breathe fresh air be found; performing calisthenics also requires at least fifteen minutes, where does this fifteen minutes come from? Moreover, his manager and boss would also consider this "unconventional and greatly inappropriate." Nutritional food is certainly a good solution! However, shop assistants receive very little salary each month, and the packed meals they eat on weekdays cannot provide much nutrition, which is also a fact. As for having a balanced diet, it is not something that shop assistants can do; when things get busy.</p>
<p>Only when each worker becomes aware, unites, and fights to win all the rights that they deserve; demands an eight-hour work system, improves treatment, and increases wages, is the correct path, is the fundamental solution, and then other issues can be discussed.</p>
<p>These are my thoughts after reading "Shop Assistants' Communication." I hope the editor will publish it in your column. If the editor thinks it is not possible to publish it, then please pass it on to Mr. Zhang himself. However, I hope it will be published. If there are disagreements, please provide guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Story of Renting a House <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>The reason why the sub-landlord is determined to "rather have a slightly lower rent but not rent to anyone without a family" is because he suffered losses in the past by not considering this point, resulting in a lot of trouble, even dragging on several months of rent, and then disappearing overnight. But once he considered only renting to families, he missed many opportunities. The small room in the pavilion has been vacant for three months. Although many people have come to inquire, they always lacked the sub-landlord's requirement of having a family.</p>
<p>The landlady felt that the house was always vacant, which was a pity, but the sub-landlord's temper was strangely stubborn, and no matter how she tried to persuade him, he would not budge. She, on the other hand, thought that as long as she didn't rent to students wearing long pants again, because the last one who disappeared overnight was a student wearing long pants, there was no need to worry about anything else.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the small room in the pavilion was rented out by the landlady.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>It was rented to a Suzhou girl. The landlady thought that such a decent girl would not cause any trouble. The sub-landlord knew about it, but shook his head even more.</p>
<p>The girl said she worked in a silk factory in ××, but her appearance didn't look like a worker. She also said that her husband was working in the city, but she often had boyfriends who came to sleep with her at night. All these things made the sub-landlord more and more suspicious and uneasy. The landlady, however, firmly believed that women were generally not as bad as men. As for saying that she might have something improper, that was the case with nine out of ten city women.</p>
<p>A month passed, and everything was peaceful. The landlord relaxed his worries by three or four points. The landlady felt even more that women were indeed not as bad as men.</p>
<p>The second month and the third month also passed peacefully, and the rent was paid in advance, and there was no trouble. The only slight problem was that there were still guests coming and going in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>The girl's words were indeed not a lie. One of her husbands came back from the Japanese, and the landlord was relieved because his condition had been met, and the place was much quieter, especially at night.</p>
<p>But for some reason, the girl has been looking gloomy recently, as if she had something on her mind. However, when her husband was around, there was nothing unusual. The landlady saw her like this and often chatted with her or invited her to eat, because they had been living together for half a year and had a considerable friendship. Sometimes, when the landlady was short of money, she would borrow thirty or fifty dollars from her. The girl never asked her to pay it back and let her pay it back whenever she wanted. When she paid it back, the girl would politely say, "Keep it and use it. I don't need it right now." This made the landlady feel even more that she was indeed not as bad as men and was simply the most reliable woman.</p>
<p>A few days ago, she suddenly said to the landlady, "My mother-in-law died and I need to send some money back. We are very short of money these days. I would like to borrow thirty dollars from you and will pay it back in three days." Coincidentally, the landlady had a sum of money on hand to pay the head landlord's rent and lent it to her immediately.</p>
<p>Three days later, the head landlord came to collect the rent. The landlady went to the small room in the pavilion and saw the girl's husband with a crying face. She comforted him and said, "Sir, your mother has lived to a hundred years old and there is no need to be overly sad." The girl's husband replied in astonishment, "My mother is not dead. It's just that my wife has run away."</p>
<p>"Huh? Your wife ran away? She even borrowed thirty dollars from me..." The landlady was bewildered.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The End of Love <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Nian</p>
<p>English, Number 13, has been depressed and unhappy recently, with a worried expression, as if she is very dissatisfied. Her oily black hair has not been combed or washed for several days, and it is as messy as pine needles. Her favorite and most fashionable happiness crepe cheongsam has not been worn for many days. The pair of high-heeled leather shoes with heels smaller than horse hooves, which she usually wears, are not on her exquisite feet today. This is truly an incredible and strange thing. "Is she correcting her extravagant lifestyle? Then, why is she so dejected!" I thought to myself.</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the times keeps turning forward. In a moment of my imagination, another week has passed. That day, when the fish belly white light broke through the dark environment and dawn broke, I was just coming back from a dream. Suddenly, there was a surprising sound outside. After a while, the alley was filled with noise. The morning air, which was as calm as a funeral procession, suddenly became noisy. A group of people were shouting:</p>
<p>"English... something bad... what... English..." At this time, sitting in the quilt, I was disturbed by them from being drowsy to being awake. But I still didn't know what was happening outside, I was just guessing in my heart.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the alley gradually subsided, and the climax of people's voices gathered at Number 13. So, I entered the path of guessing and wondering about English. "Did English commit suicide? Looking at her appearance these days, maybe..." While I was thinking like this, Old Shi next door hurried in. Gasping for breath, he said to me:</p>
<p>"Old Lou: English, Number 13, hanged herself last night."</p>
<p>"What? What? She hanged herself?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Why did she commit suicide?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"This is something I don't know. I'm afraid others are guessing the reason for her suicide."</p>
<p>"Did she commit suicide because of love?" I immediately thought of her love affair at ×× University last semester and asked myself this way.</p>
<p>After getting dressed, I rushed to her house. But her family was weeping and wailing, heartbroken. Seeing English's body made me sigh, so I had to stop asking questions. Later, English's father came out and asked a few questions briefly. As expected, it was not beyond my expectations. She committed suicide because of love!</p>
<p>From this, it aroused her past thoughts: She was a student in the Education Department of ×× University. A group of male students, like amorous bees and butterflies, bowed down under her pomegranate skirt. Because of her naturally charming appearance, it was indeed easy to make people drunk and confused, and lure them into the net of love. So, she had the elegant nicknames of "School Flower" and "Plum Blossom Goddess."</p>
<p>With spring in her heart and a lack of reason, she fell in love with Mr. B, a skilled hunter of beauty, not long ago, and then developed a physical relationship. From then on, as the scene unfolded, their emotions and desires reached an extreme climax, simply uncontrollable.</p>
<p>The man finally lacked affection. In their sweet life, Mr. B fell in love with another beautiful young girl, abandoned her for another, and gradually hated her. Later, he simply gave her cold looks and often quarreled. As a result, their love completely went bankrupt. Today, English died a tragic death.</p>
<p>Young students, love is not your bright future, it is a trap of depravity. Please reflect on yourselves quickly! Don't hesitate any longer.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Wastebasket <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Cui</p>
<p>In the past, no matter where you looked, on the main roads of the school, in the woods, in the bamboo fences, or in the thatched pavilions, you could see guys and girls talking, laughing, and telling sweet words, eating sweet candy, sitting side by side, or walking hand in hand. There were some in the morning, and even more in the evening. We won't talk about these, they love me and I love you even more. Let's talk about the stone steps around the water tower and flagpole in Zigong Well. There were always students sitting there chatting nonsense. A was peeling peanuts, and B was sucking hard on his cigarette butt. Some were reading novels, some were singing English songs from the Romance of the Xuan Palace, and some were humming Cantonese tunes. What's even more interesting is the scholar in our class, sitting alone on the desolate lawn reading ancient texts. Now, it's cold, and everything has been swept away by the northwest wind. So the "wastebasket" trick has reappeared before our eyes.</p>
<p>This "wastebasket" is strange. It didn't exist in late summer and early autumn. It only came into being because of the skin-flaying northwest wind. And it all appears on the young ladies. If she is fashionable and has a wealthy family, then she will have to bring two "wastebaskets"! The two pockets on the coat or wool short coat!</p>
<p>How did this name come about? There's a reason:</p>
<p>Miss Zhang may not be our queen, but she is indeed quiet and full of emotion, and she is also good at literature and public speaking. What attracts the most attention is her bright eyes and white teeth, and her teasing glances. However, although she loves to glance, she also implies extreme solemnity. The more solemn, the more she seems worthy of envy! The more she glances, the more she seems lovable! However, everyone only loves her privately. On the path of love, there is no room for a single move, let alone any progress.</p>
<p>It's cold, and she's already wearing a wool short coat. The guys are struggling to find a way to do something. It just so happens that the two pockets on her coat are always open, as if waiting for something to eat. A Cantonese classmate, A-Liang, often sits close to her. So he writes many small notes and throws them into her pocket. Sometimes it's like pitching pots, sometimes it's like a pickpocket sneakily. It's funny to say, our professor of political science seems to have caught a glimpse of it, but Miss Zhang doesn't know anything.</p>
<p>After class, it's time for another class. Miss Zhang runs in again. She doesn't know what to touch in her pocket. She touches several wads of paper, but pulls them out, blushing. When she hasn't finished reading one, she grumbles angrily:</p>
<p>Who is so bored? Are they using my pocket as a "wastebasket"?</p>
<p>At the same time, Miss Li, Miss Lu, ... several other classmates, also found several small wads of paper in their coat pockets. The male students laughed so hard that they leaned back and forth, while the female students were furious.</p>
<p>As a result, everyone forgot that they were supposed to be in class. Fortunately, it was announced that the teacher had taken a leave of absence due to an emergency. Wonderful! Wonderful! The laughter spread from the classroom to outside the classroom.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Debt <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Tian</p>
<p>The calendar has been turned to the last few pages, and my mood is not as usual. Recently, I am afraid of seeing terms like "winter sale" in the newspaper, because the word "winter" will make you think of "debt." Moreover, the problem of debt collection is so popular in the world these days. Wasn't the recent French cabinet forced to resign because of debt?</p>
<p>"Poverty" is certainly not a "disease," but "borrowing debt" and "repaying debt" are quite thought-provoking matters. According to the theory of natural selection, when a person is reduced to "nothing left" or "empty pockets," it is their own fault, and they cannot blame others or heaven. They should just retreat and stop eating, so as not to bother the world anymore. But "survival" is the common desire of mankind, and they will never forgive themselves for this. And things are quite different, so there is the so-called "borrowing debt."</p>
<p>"Borrowing debt" is the most difficult thing to do well in human interaction. Written, it seems too impersonal, and oral, it is difficult to say. So, the expression when borrowing debt, although not exactly "panic," is at least a little "vague." I have also borrowed debt. When I open my mouth to tell, I always feel like I am showing my weakness to others. Although it is said that "everyone has times of urgency," my petty bourgeois dignity has not been completely eliminated. I always feel inferior in front of my friends. When I walk out the door, I always breathe a sigh of relief, as if a heavy burden has been lifted. It's not afraid of the cold to say it, but this phenomenon probably only exists with "small poverty." As for borrowing tens of millions, it is certainly done openly and without any shame. At this, I am ashamed of being "outdated."</p>
<p>From borrowing debt, I think of a general fact: "Debt-ridden" is certainly not a respectable thing, but at least it can show your status. Being able to borrow tens of thousands, of course, the more the better! Society will never treat you like a poor person. Only in this depressed situation are there many people who cannot even build a debt tower, which is really pitiful. Don't talk about the farmers and workers at the end of the year, just listen to the bankruptcy sounds in the city.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Meng Guobao said, "Second Sister-in-law, haven't you ever been to town?" Wang Ersao said, "I went once when I was little for a temple fair in the town, but I don't remember it now." Meng Guobao said, "Ah! People in the countryside are so pitiful, they can't eat well, they can't dress well, and they can't see the colorful world." As he said this, he broke off a willow branch and sat on the stump of a willow tree that had fallen into the water. He brushed the surface of the water with the willow branch. Wang Ersao smiled and said, "Mr. Meng always says that he pities us country people. You have a good heart." Meng Guobao smiled and said, "After talking for two days, Second Sister-in-law has shown sympathy for me. Lao Er still doesn't understand." Wang Ersao pressed her clothes with both hands, slightly raising her head, sighed, and said, "Farmers, what do they know." After speaking, she sniffled and lowered her head to wash the clothes.</p>
<p>㈤ The Landlord Came</p>
<p>From this conversation, Wang Ersao felt that Mr. Meng was truly a sympathetic person, and what he said was reasonable. The two of them were separated by a pond corner and talked one sentence at a time. Later, two children leading cows brought the cows to the pond to drink water. Meng Guobao couldn't continue talking, so he got up and left. That night, he came again to continue talking about things in the city. He said that in silk shops, the fabrics could be piled up like mountains, and the shops that sell rouge and powder smelled fragrant even when passing by their doors. In theaters, plays were always performed with sets, and when they sang about mountains, there were real mountains on the stage, and when they sang about water, there was real water on the stage. Wang Ersao was truly enjoying it more and more, and they dispersed late at night. The next morning, Meng Guobao got up and hadn't had breakfast yet. He took some of the remaining gifts he had brought back from the city and wrapped them in a handkerchief, carrying them to Wang Lao Er's house. Just as he reached the door, he saw Wang Ersao carrying a slaughtered chicken: she was about to walk to the pond. Seeing Meng Guobao, she smiled and called out "Mr. Meng," supporting herself against a tree by the roadside, smiling at him. Meng Guobao didn't have much to say, only that perfunctory sentence, "Is Lao Er at home?" Wang Ersao said, "The landlord came, and he's accompanying him in the main room. I was thinking of preparing the chicken and then asking him to invite Mr. Meng for dinner. It's a coincidence that Mr. Meng came. I've fried melon seeds and made hot tea, please come inside and sit down." He heard that Wang Lao Er was accompanying the landlord, and he was a little unwilling to go in, but then he thought that he was here to investigate the rural economic situation, and participating in this conversation between the landlord and the tenant might give him some material, so he smiled at Wang Ersao and said, "I have some small things here to give to Second Sister-in-law, please don't say that I gave them to you, just say that my mother gave them to you, okay?"</p>

<h3 id="e199">Hollywood's Fortune Teller Talks About Jean Harlow's Future (Part 2) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Besides Jani Furling, there are also two fortune tellers in Hollywood, Dario and Marlon Nofal. Dario is an astrologer and can also read palms and understand psychology. His observation of Jean Harlow's future is slightly different from Jani Furling's. He said that Jean will definitely become famous in the future, but she will not have happiness. She will marry someone in the film industry within two years, but this marriage will still end in tragedy. After this tragedy, after another two or three years, she will marry someone with the same intelligence as Paul Bern. She loves him, and he submits to her like a tired bird returning to its nest. But the two of them will never be able to achieve complete happiness, because Jean Harlow is born without the joy of marriage. She will continue to work hard in the film industry and achieve great success, but fate will be bumpy, and she will hope for happiness throughout her life. The third fortune teller, Marlon Nofal, is an astronomer who is good at observing the stars and determining good and bad luck. Two weeks before Paul Bern's death, he told the famous director, Griffith, that a big figure in the film industry would soon commit suicide. He said that Paul's suicide was caused by a very subtle and extremely dangerous stellar vibration. He said that Jean Harlow was born on March 3, which belongs to the water element; Paul was born on December 13, which belongs to the fire element; and the star that manages the film industry is Neptune. So Jean and Paul, one belonging to water and the other belonging to fire, were placed together in the same field of Neptune, just like putting water and fire in a bottle. Water and fire will naturally restrain and annihilate each other. This time, of course, water prevailed over fire, and Paul could not escape the path of suicide. Therefore, it seems that Jean and Paul should not have been together in the first place. There was no possibility of them getting along in peace. As for Jean's future, Marlon Nofal firmly believes that Jean will continue to work in the film industry. She will remarry within two years, and she can get some happiness after marriage. At this time, I am afraid that Jean will leave the film industry.</p>
<p>The three predictions mentioned above have their own opinions. We will not know whose prediction is right and whose prediction is wrong until the future. But it is very strange that there is one thing that they all say the same thing, that is, Jean Harlow will remarry within two years. There is also one thing that Jani Furling and Dario agree on, that is, the person Jean marries is probably not someone in the film industry.</p>
<p>, but at least has some relationship with the film industry. As for whether Jean can get happiness after remarrying, the opinions are divided. It is best to remember the predictions of the three of them and see if they come true in two years.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Review of "Speak Easily" <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>In the past two months, the movies shown in various theaters have been dominated by comedies, which also shows the trend of American films.</p>
<p>Buster Keaton's movies have suddenly increased since the prevalence of sound films. Among the veteran comedy stars, no one can compare with him in terms of quantity. The quality is also good. If you don't believe it, you can take a look at his recent "Speak Easily".</p>
<p>The story is about a college professor who was tricked by someone into thinking he had made a fortune. So he resigned and planned to go to Chicago. He arrived in a small village, shook hands with two passengers (vaudeville performers) to say goodbye at the station, but the train left. So he had to find the vaudeville troupe again. Because of his lavish spending, everyone in the troupe flattered him. He also appreciated one of the actresses. With mutual use, he actually became the troupe leader and took everyone to perform on Broadway. At that time, other actresses also tried their best to win him over. With his dull and silly attitude, the performance became a great comedy. At the same time, the huge sum of money he dreamed of actually fell from the sky. The 8,000-foot comedy ends with him kissing the actress.</p>
<p>Keaton's performance is excellent. His iron-like face and very cold attitude, the big moves, are all very pleasing. Jimmy Durante, with the big nose, is working with him for the second time. The reason for the laughter is the opposite. Jimmy is completely happy-go-lucky. Several of the supporting male actors are very good, but the female actors are not as good, and their performances are inevitably over the top.</p>

<p>Ah Bao's mother is playing a phonograph and singing opera; Ah Bao is very curious and asks, "Mom! Is there someone hiding inside?"</p>
<p>When foreign talking pictures first arrived in Shanghai, the villagers suddenly heard sounds coming from the screen. They were baffled and said, "Could there be someone hiding behind the screen talking?"</p>
<p>The first joke is still just a joke, but the second joke, ha ha! has already become a reality! Don't you believe it? I'll tell you, this joke happened in our own country's movie theaters!</p>
<p>A year or two ago! It was during the recession in our country's film industry, and speculative elements in the film industry, seeing the development of Western talking pictures, almost all the business of Shanghai cinemas was taken over by talking pictures! At this time, the Chinese people warmly welcomed talking pictures as a new industry. The heads of small companies were envious and thought about taking advantage of it. They racked their brains and used eye-catching advertisements with "Domestic Talking Pictures" as a facade, saying that they were striving for domestic films! Competing with imported talking pictures! In fact, the trick was exposed. What "Domestic Talking Pictures" were all fiction, just as the villager said: there were people hiding behind the screen! They were lying in wait behind the scenes, reading the subtitles on the screen, just like ordinary conversations! Isn't this the biggest joke in the world?</p>
<p>The above story has indeed become a reality from a joke! Is it true or not? It's just that I'm not willing to reveal the name of this company!</p>

<p>According to secret reports, in February 1933, two large-scale film companies appeared one after another, and they are currently in the process of very secret organization. The participants are all people in the film industry today with considerable strength, but due to various reasons, they will never reveal their true colors until they reach maturity.</p>

<h3 id="e203">"Don't Know How to Use" and "Don't Know How to Earn" <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Americans once said about the characteristics of the Chinese nation, "Chinese people in business don't know how to use money, so they don't know how to earn." Indeed, Americans really know how to use money, so they really know how to earn money. Even just looking at the film industry, you can see the correctness of this principle and the reason why American filmmakers succeed and Chinese filmmakers fail.</p>
<p>The article "Paramount's Shanghai War Films" published in this magazine on the 14th said that the company made a profit of more than 2.4 million, which is a good proof of this principle.</p>
<p>Some people say that American films are built on gold, with luxurious furnishings, magnificent sets, skilled actors, glamorous actresses, and their fully displayed red lips and white legs, and everything else. Although many people criticize them for this, American filmmakers have made a lot of money. They really know how to use money, so their money will naturally be earned.</p>
<p>Looking back at our Chinese filmmakers, they are different. Not only do they not know how to use money, but they are also unwilling to use money. Now that they are willing to use money, they still don't know how to use it. Take "Laughing and Crying Fate" by Mingxing as an example. They filmed six episodes, and they were willing to spend money, but because they didn't know how to use it, each episode was worse than the last. If the authorities of "Mingxing Company" knew how to use money, the situation would be different. They would definitely take the money spent on filming six episodes and select the most exciting and meaningful fragments or the essence of the entire book "Laughing and Crying Fate" and film it into one episode, putting the directing, photography, and all the spirit of filming six episodes into one episode, then its results would definitely be very impressive, and it could earn a lot of money.</p>
<h3 id="e204">After Watching "Three Modern Women" <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>"Three Modern Women" is indeed a modern film. It clearly says that fine wine, beauties, enjoyment, and leisure are all things of the past, outdated, and not modern. The trend should be popularization and socialization. The story is very ordinary, the directing is still very flexible, the sets are also magnificent, and the photography and lighting are beautiful. Among the products of Lianhua, (except for Humanity) this film shows amazing progress.</p>
<p>What is worth mentioning is the realism of the portrayal of laborers. A modern film that focuses on urban life can also take into account the back of urban prosperity, which is the success of the director.</p>
<p>This film is very suitable for the tastes of all classes, upper, middle, and lower. I hope that modern young people will go and see it, recognize their own position, and learn what is called admirable and enviable "modernity."</p>

<h3 id="e205">Swanson's Children's Education <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Nan</p>
<p>Mrs. Swanson now has three children. The oldest is a daughter named Gloria, who is now eleven years old; the second is an adopted son named Joseph, who is now nine years old; the youngest is named Michele, who is also a daughter, and is only six months old.</p>
<p>Since Swanson gave birth to Gloria, she decided that her children would not be allowed to be photographed; not allowed to be publicized; not spoiled; and that all educational supplies should be equipped according to the most beautiful class, giving them the best opportunities; but other than that, they should enter society in the same way as children from ordinary families. She still adheres to her principles to this day, unbreakable. Her children have never been photographed or published in newspapers. Not long ago, a London reporter secretly took a photo of her youngest daughter, and when Swanson found out, she was furious. She is currently filming in London, and she occasionally allows her children to step into the doors of the cinema, but only to make them not completely ignorant of the production aspects of the film. But other than that, she often makes them understand that they are in the same position as children from ordinary families, and also wants to make the students in the school not feel that there is anything different about them.</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan directed the patriotic blockbuster "Adventures in the War Zone" by Mingxing Company, showing the scene when Hu Die was captured and imprisoned, and the two enemy agents were vying for her attention. This film will be released in the Central Grand Theater on New Year's Day in the solar calendar.</p>
<p>Anecdotes of the Film Industry</p>
<h3 id="e206">The Struggle History of Several Stars (Part Two) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Jun</p>
<p>Constance Bennett lived an unsettled life between New York and Europe as a child. She understood the ways of the world at the age of ten. Her environment was very good, and she lived a wealthy and luxurious life since she was a child. However, when she first entered the film industry, she was despised like Clara Bow, but she did not give in. She was very uninhibited and had experience in the ways of the world, so a twenty-seven-year-old woman occupies an important position among Hollywood stars.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer, who is called Darling of the gods, also had a hard time at first. In the beginning, she couldn't find a position in New York to solve her bread problem. She kept some of the money she earned from work to support her life. She preferred to walk when she went out, saving the fare. After struggling so hard, she was finally recognized for her achievements in silent films. This was not a fluke.</p>
<p>Barbara Stanwyck had it even harder. She was raised in an orphanage. She had a natural voice, and her singing was very moving. At first, she was a dancer, then a singer, and then entered the film industry. She struggled against her predicament for a very long time, and eventually succeeded. She is a star in Hollywood who is known for her courage and魄力.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford's beginning also has an interesting story. When she first arrived in Hollywood, she was an unnoticed minimum dancer; short and fat, wearing ill-fitting clothes, Hollywood was a place where romantic people gathered, how could she not envy their luxurious lives: slowly her ambition sprouted, she developed a desire to be a character, she gradually changed from her inside to her outside: she gradually read books, trimmed her hair, face, and changed to fashionable clothes: from being neglected in the past, she is now enthusiastic, when she married Douglas Fairbanks Jr., she completely broke away from the original Joan Crawford, and created a new and sincere passionate Joan Crawford.</p>
