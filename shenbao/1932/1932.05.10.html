<p>此次上海虹口公園炸案發生後。日當局會同法巡捕房。在法租界搜捕與此案有關之韓僑。致引起韓僑之恐怖。而安昌浩之被捕。尤爲韓僑所反對。各界所注目。茲請根據法律。對於安案作一簡單之檢討。　　查安氏之被捕。在其訪問韓僑李春山時。時巡捕曁日軍人。往逮李氏李適不在其寓。祗因偶遇安氏。遂將氏捕去。就法律而論。日當局如欲逮捕安氏。事前應向法院請求拘提安氏之拘票。而拘票上應載明（一）被告之姓名性别住址。或其他足資辨别之特徴。（二）告之犯罪行爲。（三）拘提之理由。但日軍人未得此項拘票。遽將安氏逮捕其爲不合於法彰彰明甚。　　安氏爲三韓獨立運動之領袖宜爲日方所忌惟氏縱因運動獨立而獲罪。要亦純粹的政治犯。未可與尋常罪犯。相提並論。政治犯不應引渡爲國際公法所公認。良以政治犯不問其爲維新派或守舊黨。大抵懷救國拯民之志。無自私自利之謀。故文明各國。莫不予以庇護。遠在一八四八年代。歐洲大陸政治犯之匿居英倫三島者不可勝計。爾時英國猶且不予引渡亦不願逐之出墳。乃今日上海。竟不能庇一安氏。原因所在。殊不能令人無疑。　　不寗唯是。據上海律師公會上國府司法外交兩部冬電。晏彰昊原名安昌浩。曾於民國十一年取得我國第八五三號入籍許可證書。是安氏實我國之人民。非依去年公佈之（關於上海法租界内設置中國法院之協定。）不得擅行拘囚。查該協定第六條載。（凡在租界内逮捕之人犯。除休息日不計外。應於二十四小時内。送交該管法院。逾時不送交者。應即釋放。）又第七條載。（任何人犯。非經該管法院庭詢。不得移送於租界外之官廳……）今茲日軍逮捕安氏。事前旣未向中國法院請得拘票。事後不交中國法院庭詢且又迄今未將安氏釋放。是又不能無疑。　　在法律之前。人人平等。悉有同等之權利與義務。安氏詎能外此。吾人屏除一切感情與客氣僅僅就事論事。則政府實亟應以外交手段。糾正前失不可默爾而息。在滬之東西人士。不乏法治之素養與習慣。爲維持法律與條約計。爲保障人權計。當亦不忍坐視上海開此有關全市聲譽之惡例也。昨日接收瀏河嘉定南翔</p>

<p>余經商日本。歷有年所。去歲九一八起。僑胞益被仇視。二月前因敝店夥友劉君被害。而店亦被毁。不得已歇業返國。離日前遍歷東京各地。藉資觀察。見聞極多。摭述一二。以告國人。　　近來東京滿佈戰雲。日軍部聲稱日美之戰。爲期不遠。飭各軍一律武裝準備。並從事建築防禦工程。海軍密佈各要塞。暗施魚雷。防空設備。亦已置妥。現正積極建造地下鐵道及兵工廠。日政府且擬遷都朝鮮。一部份已秘密移往。其計劃如單獨對美作戰。則先發制人。直取菲列濱。消滅美國遠東艦隊。然後進攻舊金山。如英美聨合。則取守勢。以海軍全力守東京。放棄台灣。勝則攻取新加坡菲律。濱。敗則退出本土而守朝鮮。及中國東北等部。　　至此次滬戰。日人損失極重。總共傷亡士兵數約二三萬。尤以一二八二九兩日之海軍陸戰隊傷亡更衆。三千人幾無百人生還。大角海相得息。痛惜異常。曾泣語人曰。帝國練海軍三十年。素爲世界各國所稱道。今竟爲支那軍擊得如此狼狽。將來若遇强有力的敵人。更不堪設想矣。</p>

<p>行走的魚魚只能用著它們的尾巴。在水中游泳。這是人人所知道的。在普通人的眼光看來。魚在水中游泳時。似乎得力於尾鰭。尾鰭動得快。它也游得快。其於魚身兩旁的肌肉。然後能在水中游行自如。但是現在經了種種試騐。纔知道魚類不但能游泳。有的魚竟能到水外來爬樹或行走的。最近倫敦動物院中。到了許多能行走的魚。是從爪哇Ｊava來的。它們出了水。可以把它們的胸鰭代腿代脚。在地上行走。又有一種魚。在水外可以生活好幾天。能爬上高高的棕樹。古人説的（緣木求魚。）倒眞的實現了。</p>

<p>昨日報載，吳佩孚在北平寓中，堂中高懸乩書壽字，上書青玄老人書付智玄，智玄即吳秀才的法號，吳秀才的才學如何，人格如何，我現在不來下以批判，但吳秀才總可説是一個迷信者，我今日借秀才來提出這個迷信問題，加以討論，到底。。　　迷信有什麽罪狀，　　不迷信有什麽好處，　　破除迷信這句口號，早已高唱入雲，至於近年，更加雷厲風行，前年幾位城隍老爺，土地菩薩，大倒其霉，有的請入冷宫，有的抛諸東洋大海，最可憐的，幾位拆字。起課，瞎眼算命。的先生們，也要逼着他們去改習行業，試問現在生計没落的中國，就是高貴的大學畢業生，或舶來品的博士碩士，一時還没有事做，呌幾位瞎子先生，去改什麽業呢？這是一個例，　　近日吳淞閘北等處戰事，在日兵身畔，搜出像（南無阿彌陀佛）的符咒，不可勝數，前日他們追悼陣亡將士，也請了不少的日本僧人，超度一般異域寃魂，照這樣看來，日本迷信的程度，並不亞於我國，但是他們的文化依舊進展，國家的實力，依舊澎脹，可見迷信一事，不一定阻礙文化，不一定阻礙國家的發展，而不迷信亦未見有什麽好處，這又是一個例，　　果然我不能説他們的進化，由於迷信，但亦總可説迷信實與進化無關，我國的政治不良，文化落後，並不去努力改進，而汲汲焉舍本逐末，惟破除迷信是務，結果祗失了一般愚夫愚婦的信仰，增加了本來無聊生活的失業者，試問更有什麽益處呢？　　若更進一步説，極野蠻的民族，且不必講，即如歐美各國，其人民宗教思想，何等濃重，何等普遍，何嘗不是迷信，到底未曾剝奪他們文明國的徽號，未曾阻斷了他們國家强盛的前途，若再廣義一些説，無論何人，總帶有一些迷信的色彩，　　旣云迷信，必定有迷信的對像，其對像不一定（神妖鬼怪），方爲迷信，熱衷利祿者，以陞官發財爲其對像，喜色情狂者，以摩登女郎爲其對像，喜吃老酒者，以紹興高粱爲其對像，有芙蓉癖者，以陳公膏爲其對像，嗜賭博者，以××公司××總會爲其對像，時裝少女，浮滑少年，以跳舞廳影戲院爲其對像，誇豪闊者，以洋房汽車。及三公司陳列的奇裝艷服。富麗物品爲其對像，這種對像，亦何嘗不可説是迷信？　　若把以上兩種的迷信，請法官來判斷罪名，我想前者還是過失的犯了一種輕微的罪名，後者乃是（公共危險）罪呢　　註公共危險罪，在法律上决不如　　此解説，不過借牠一個名詞來應用罷了，</p>

<h3 id="c186">汽水自製和原理 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 克</p>
<p>天氣一天熱似一天，汽水（按汽水西名AeratedWater原義應作炭酸水）也漸漸上市了，所以特地把汽水的製法寫出，同時更把汽水作一個簡單的探討。　　（Ａ）材料：　　（一）檸檬酸（CitricacidHC6H5O7）｜果實中多含有此酸，含有一分子的水，成無色的結晶，易溶於水，酸性甚輕爽。　　（二）小蘇打（BicarbonateofSodaNaHCO3）｜即酸性炭酸鈉，俗稱小蘇打。以上二物，各處藥房都有出售。　　（Ｂ）準備｜冷沸水·有彈子的汽水瓶·果子露·糖精或糖汁·其他各種香料如香蕉油等·戥子一個·　　（Ｃ）製法｜先將果子露及糖汁香料等，傾入瓶中約四分之一·（以瓶爲單位）然後灌入冷沸水，再用戥子把小蘇打稱十分，先傾入瓶中，即用手掌緊八分，待檸檬酸一入瓶中，即用手掌緊覆瓶口，急將瓶倒置，愈快愈妙·因爲檸檬酸一遇小蘇打，即起化學變化，生出多量炭酸氣，瓶中的彈子，即藉汽力而落下，緊附在瓶口的橡皮圈上，此時，汽水也可算告成了·如要吃時，祇須將彈子推下，亦如市上出賣的一樣，會生出很多的汽來，假使做得得法，滋味亦不下於市上所出賣的·　　（Ｄ）原理和功用｜汽水的原理，即是檸檬酸遇小蘇打後，起化學變化而生出炭酸氣，炭酸氣本不願溶於水中，但因瓶口緊塞，不能向外跑出，遂不得不溶在水中·待塞子一開，一部份炭酸氣即跑出，同時水面的壓力减輕，故水就起泡，好似沸騰一樣·功用則在凉爽可口，可以止渴，并且助消化，炭酸氣入肺當然有害，然而入胃却并没有什麽害處的·　　附帶聲明一句，市上所出售的汽水，并不是這樣製法，因爲此法祇適用於做少量的·故祇適用家庭中，至於説到市上的汽水，是利用高壓力，使大量炭酸氣溶於水中而製成，不過其目的無百在使炭酸氣溶於水中而已·</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>在南京路上的行人之中、我們如果統計一下、那麽來往的西裝少年、至少有十分之一二、這次我回到松江去、在比較的最繁盛的嶽廟街上、碰到西裝少年、大槪也可占到百分之一二、再從松江回到故鄉、那邊是一個冷落的市鎭、人口不多、以前呢？在街上本來找不到一個西裝少年的、但現在也有兩三個西裝少年、皮鞋聲得得、徘徊於我們的鎭上、　　中國青年的心理、以爲穿了西裝、有多麽漂亮、無非是受了虚榮心的衝動、在現社會上、一個中等以上的學生、偶而出去應酬、不穿着一副西裝、在許多的西裝朋友之中、不免要自賤形穢、所以連窮到不能付學費的朋友、西裝却不可不預備一套、　　尤其男女社交公開、戀愛自由的聲浪日高的時候、一個年青到達了求偶的時期、要想找覔女友、非要去交際不可、但在交際塲中、你如果不穿上一身西裝、也許因爲不體面、不神氣、而難能得到摩登女郎的青睞、同時她們在同性的友侶之中、有了西裝少年做情人、似乎在面子上生了許多光彩、　　所以近來青年的喜服西裝、可算是虚榮和求愛的心理的表現、</p>

<p>｜｜捉蟋蟀　　爲什麽拾紙烟屁股名之爲捉蟋蟀？這是連捉蟋蟀的阿三自己也是不大明白的。不過他都算完全懂得了捉蟋蟀到底是怎樣的一回事了。　　照阿三的年齡來説，他還是和坐汽車上小學的少爺們一樣年青，但是從去年起，他便　不得不開始獨立生活了。在他的小癟三同伴中他學會了拾紙烟屁股，於是這便成爲他唯一的生活法門。　　每天都是一樣，他一個早晨便得提起小布袋到馬路上去做生活，電車站，電影院門前，以及一切熱鬧的塲所，都是他頂好的躑躅之所。在人羣中擁擠着，小心而繼續的找尋他唯一的生活資料。　　近來這種生活並不好做，操着這同樣工作的除了原有的抽大烟的朋友以外還增加了好些從外國跑來的露宋。所以有時竟會爲着爭搶一個比較長大的烟頭而遭受他們大年齡的辱駡或毆打，有時甚至流出血來。　　然而長時間的經騐却給與他許多寳貴的教訓··譬如説卡德路，泥城橋那些地方，烟屁股固然多，可是都是只剩一點兒而且烟葉癟脚，反之在外灘，大馬路，靜安寺路一帶，所拾到的幾乎都是頂黄的烟絲并且很長的一段。好烟絲可賣好的價錢。，所以卡德路等地的工人區域，到底是值得咒咀的了。　　（×他媽｜一紙烟吸到這樣的一點兒才丢掉，……）當他在連日天雨以後而偏又只能拾到不及半寸的烟屁股時他常是這樣無情的咒駡的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Legal Issues of the Ahn Case <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Following the bombing at Hongkou Park in Shanghai, the Japanese authorities, in conjunction with the French Concession police, conducted searches in the French Concession, arresting Korean residents suspected of involvement in the case, causing terror among the Korean community. The arrest of Ahn Chang-ho was particularly opposed by the Korean community and drew widespread attention. We now present a brief review of the Ahn case from a legal perspective.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, Ahn's arrest occurred during a visit to Korean resident Lee Chun-san. Police officers and Japanese soldiers went to arrest Lee, but he was not at home. They encountered Ahn by chance and arrested him. From a legal standpoint, if the Japanese authorities wished to arrest Ahn, they should have first requested an arrest warrant from the court. The warrant should have included (1) the defendant's name, gender, address, and other identifying characteristics; (2) the alleged criminal act; and (3) the reasons for the arrest. However, the Japanese soldiers did not obtain such a warrant and proceeded to arrest Ahn, which is a clear violation of the law.</p>
<p>Ahn is a leader of the Korean independence movement and is therefore feared by the Japanese. However, even if he is guilty of advocating for independence, he is still purely a political prisoner and should not be treated as a common criminal. It is a universally recognized principle of international law that political prisoners should not be extradited. This is because political prisoners, whether they are progressives or conservatives, generally harbor a desire to save the country and its people, without seeking personal gain. Therefore, civilized nations universally grant them protection. As far back as the 1840s, countless European political prisoners sought refuge in the British Isles. At that time, Britain did not extradite them or expel them. It is therefore perplexing that Shanghai today cannot protect even one Ahn. The reasons for this are indeed questionable.</p>
<p>What's more, according to a telegram from the Shanghai Bar Association to the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Ahn Chang-ho, originally named Ahn Chang-ho, obtained Citizenship Permit No. 853 in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. Therefore, Ahn is actually a citizen of our country, and he cannot be arbitrarily detained except in accordance with the (Agreement on the Establishment of Chinese Courts in the French Concession of Shanghai), which was promulgated last year. Article 6 of that agreement states, "Any suspect arrested within the Concession shall be delivered to the competent court within twenty-four hours, excluding rest days. If the suspect is not delivered within the time limit, he shall be released immediately." Article 7 also states, "No suspect shall be transferred to a government office outside the Concession without being questioned by the competent court..." The Japanese military arrested Ahn without first obtaining an arrest warrant from the Chinese court and has not handed him over to the Chinese court for questioning, nor has he released him to date. This is also cause for concern.</p>
<p>Before the law, all people are equal and have equal rights and obligations. Ahn should not be an exception. Setting aside all emotions and pleasantries, and speaking solely on the facts, the government should urgently correct the previous error through diplomatic means and not remain silent. Among the Western and Eastern people in Shanghai, there is no lack of understanding and adherence to the rule of law. To maintain the law and treaties and to protect human rights, they should not tolerate the setting of such a bad precedent in Shanghai, which would affect the city's reputation. Yesterday, the receipt of Liuhe, Jiading, and Nanxiang began.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Security Police Deployed <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Transportation agencies worked diligently to ensure the first phase of the Japanese troop withdrawal. It was decided that by 1 PM yesterday, the Japanese troops in Liuhe, Jiading, and Nanxiang would be completely withdrawn. Luodian's final withdrawal was scheduled for 1 PM today. Yesterday, our receiving committee began the handover process. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e3">Receiving Committee's Takeover Work <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>▲ Japanese troops withdraw from three locations: Nanxiang, Liuhe, Jiading, and Luodian. Because the Japanese side was awaiting our personnel to take over, they had four infantry battalions and one mountain artillery team stationed in the area. It was decided in advance that they would completely withdraw by 1 PM yesterday. As for the troops stationed in Luodian, their complete withdrawal was scheduled for 1 PM today. However, according to a message from the Shanghai Municipal Government at 6 PM yesterday, the Japanese troops at the front line in Liuhe had already completely withdrawn, while those in Jiading and Nanxiang were still in the process of withdrawing. Our receiving personnel had already negotiated with the Japanese authorities in advance, and the handover work was proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>▲ Luodian to be taken over today: The Japanese troops in Luodian consist of one infantry battalion and one mountain artillery platoon. Their final withdrawal is scheduled for 1 PM today. Yesterday, the receiving committee ordered Bao Shan County Magistrate Sun Xiwen, along with translator Huo Shi and eleven attendants, to proceed to the location to handle the handover. Sun and his party set off at 11 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Liuhe takeover completed: Regarding the takeover of Liuhe, Jiading, and Nanxiang, the respective receiving committees handled the matters separately yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the committee received a report from translator Tao Xiaojie in Liuhe stating, "Yesterday (the day before yesterday), I went to Liuhe with District Chief Qian to meet with Ishikawa, the commander of the Japanese garrison. As a result of the negotiations, our police were allowed to take over the defense at 8 AM today (yesterday), while the Japanese troops withdrew separately. All the houses and equipment occupied by the Japanese troops in the area have been inventoried and handed over to District Chief Qian for takeover."</p>
<p>▲ Defense of the withdrawal areas: Regarding the defense of the areas being taken over, the Jiangsu Provincial Government sent 300 police officers the day before yesterday to be stationed in Anting. That evening, the receiving committee assigned 200 police officers to Taicang and Liuhe, and 100 to Nanxiang, to take over the respective areas.</p>
<p>▲ Dispatching personnel for on-site inspection: Yesterday, the receiving committee considered that Liuhe, Jiading, and Nanxiang were quite far from Shanghai, and that intelligence was not readily available. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, committee member Wen Yingxing sent four inspectors—Li Qingxin, Guo Zhenliang, Guo Chenghai, and Zeng Keguang—on a special trip to the various areas to inspect the takeover situation on-site. These personnel returned to Shanghai late last night.</p>
<p>▲ Zhu Xibai arrives in Shanghai: Zhu Xibai, a member of the receiving committee, arrived in Shanghai by boat yesterday to participate in the takeover work. Li Mingyang, the Jiangsu Provincial Government's receiving committee member, will depart for the front this morning to inspect the takeover matters.</p>
<p>▲ Ping's Security Team Arrives in Beijing: Regarding the issue of the Beiping Security Team coming to Shanghai, the receiving committee received a telegram from Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating, "Received telegram from Director Zhang Yu of Beiping, stating that the first batch of 500 security team members, led by Lu Lu, departed from Pingyang evening and will transfer from Tianjin south on Geng evening. Expected to arrive at Pukou around the day of Zheng. The Ministry of Railways has been ordered to prepare cars to await the team's arrival in Pukou and then order them to transfer to the front." However, according to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 9th, 500 special police officers arrived here from Beiping today. Because they are all unarmed, they are now awaiting the Ministry of Military Affairs to provide them with weapons before heading to Kunshan to take over the defense of the areas vacated by the Japanese soldiers. It is currently scheduled to depart tomorrow night or Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Railway Bureau Actively Resumes Traffic <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>▲ Negotiate the return of the engine plant: Railway Bureau Chief Chen Xinghan stated that as the Japanese troops had gradually withdrawn as agreed, railway traffic should be restored immediately. However, the Wusong engine plant was still within the Japanese area, making it difficult for the bureau to proceed with everything. Therefore, he sent a letter to the receiving committee, asking it to forward it to the Chinese representatives on the joint committee to negotiate with the Japanese side for its early return. It is reported that Secretary-General Yu, the Chinese member of the joint committee, has already negotiated with the Japanese side and notified Kleninghan, the chairman of the committee, of the details.</p>
<p>▲ Lujiabang and other stations to resume operations first: The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau plans to resume operations at all stations east of Kunshan immediately after the Japanese troops withdraw. Yesterday, it was learned that the East Section Traffic Department of the railway had issued an order, notifying the personnel of Lujiabang and the Nanxiang station's telegraph and ticket departments in Shanghai to go to the section chief's office at 2:30 PM yesterday to collect free travel passes so that they could detour through Suzhou this morning and return to their original stations to serve.</p>
<p>▲ Qingyanggang Bridge to be repaired: An electrical dispatch from Suzhou on the 8th stated that the Qingyanggang Bridge, Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Kilometer 70, is being supervised by Yin Zhi of the Second Division. Negotiations are currently underway with the 19th Route Army. Once work begins, the entire line can be opened to traffic in at most seven days.</p>
<p>▲ Director Zheng's speech: At 10 AM yesterday (the 9th), Zheng Baozhao, director of the Traffic Department of the Railway Bureau, in order to prepare for the resumption of traffic and encourage employees to work hard, personally visited the temporary office of the bureau's traffic personnel in Guangxi Road, Cian Lane, and convened all employees in Shanghai to deliver a speech. He said, in brief, that the recent Shanghai Incident had been sudden, and the railway had borne the brunt, with considerable losses, as everyone knew. A large number of employees lived in the war zone, and the impact had been great, with years of hard work completely sacrificed, which was well known to all the bureau's colleagues. Now that the Sino-Japanese agreement had been signed, and the cessation of hostilities and withdrawal of troops would be implemented as agreed, the bureau was actively pursuing plans to resume traffic, and traffic would be restored in two weeks. In the future, all employees should continue to maintain their past spirit of hard work and be loyal to their duties. They should not allow material sacrifices to cause spiritual decline. They should understand that the bureau, after this time of chaos, should work even harder to revive the railway's business, which is also a way to compensate for personal losses.</p>
<p>▲ Circular from the Traffic Department: Yesterday, the Traffic Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways issued a separate circular to the chief of the Shanghai-Nanjing Line and the chiefs of various sections and stations stationed there, stating, "Greetings, the Shanghai-Nanjing Line will soon be open to traffic. All employees of the East Section, from Qingyanggang eastward to the stations of the Shanghai-Songhu branch line, who were transferred to Suzhou and Changzhou for work due to the war, and those who reported to Shanghai, must all prepare from today to return to their original stations for work. Those employees who were transferred to Suzhou and Changzhou should report to the East Section night shift chief and await dispatch at any time without delay. Those who were transferred to work on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line should also be investigated by the relevant section chief and ordered to prepare to return to their original stations. This circular is hereby issued in addition to the separate notice, so that you may all comply and inform accordingly, and report back as required."</p>
<h3 id="e5">Post Office Plans to Resume Postal Services in War Zones <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>▲ Baotai postal services have been restored: Before the signing of the agreement, the Shanghai Postal Administration had negotiated with the Japanese side and agreed to first restore postal services in the three invaded areas of Zhenru, Baoshan, and Wusong. The Taicang post office was also restored at the same time.</p>
<p>▲ Sending personnel to Jiading, etc.: Since the Japanese troops began withdrawing on the 6th, transportation in various places urgently needs to be restored. The Shanghai Postal Administration sent personnel to Liuhe, Anting, Nanxiang, and Jiading the day before yesterday to handle the restoration of postal services in those areas. It is reported that as soon as the situation is settled, mail delivery will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>▲ Negotiating for Zhabei postal services: Although Zhabei is nearby, it is still within the Japanese defense perimeter. However, the post office is seeking to restore postal services as soon as possible and has therefore negotiated with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>▲ Jiangwan post office site destroyed: Jiangwan was the site of fierce fighting, so the Jiangwan post office site was also destroyed by artillery fire. The post office has decided not to re-establish a post office for the time being, and will only set up a letter box first.</p>
<h3 id="e6">International Radio Station Moves Back to Zhenru <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Zhenru International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications has been subjected to the threat of Japanese aircraft, but all employees have remained on duty, risking their lives to maintain China's international communications. On March 2, when Japanese troops entered Zhenru, the station's management personnel transported important equipment to Shanghai, and all international communications were transmitted by the Fenglinqiao Radio Station as usual. Now that the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement has been signed, the station will transport the equipment in Shanghai back for installation and has resumed communications with Europe and the United States on the 7th of this month. Armistice Agreement</p>
<h3 id="e7">Copy Not Signed Yesterday <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>▲ Failure to decide on the word "location" The issue of signing the copy of the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement, although both governments have issued instructions to Shanghai, the meaning of the translated Chinese text is still subject to debate. Yesterday morning, our representatives Zhang Sixu, Deng Zhongying, and Yin Rugeng, and Japanese representatives Horiuchi, Okazaki, and translator Arino, met at the Japanese Consulate, but were still unable to reach a complete decision, so it was not signed yesterday. The dispute over the meaning of the words "(acts of hostility)" and "(withdrawal)" has been resolved, and only the word "(location)" remains. According to Okazaki, the Japanese secretary in charge of the matter, the word (HOSTILITIES) (which we translated as "acts of hostility," Note from the reporter: the translation of this word is very important. The Japanese side requested that it be translated as "acts of enmity," which is a very broad term that includes popular anti-Japanese sentiment and boycotts of Japanese goods. Anything that the Japanese side considers to be an act of hostility will be included, which would inevitably involve political issues. "Acts of hostility" only includes military actions) has been resolved. Only one word remains unresolved. He would not say clearly whether this word was (WITHDRAW) (i.e., withdrawal) or (PLACE) (i.e., location). It is expected that this copy can be signed tomorrow or the day after, and Minister Chongguang will now be able to sign in person, without having to wait for a supplementary signature in the future. After further inquiry, it was learned that the word was indeed "(location)" and that negotiations will be held again this morning. If it can be determined, it can be signed in the afternoon; otherwise, it will have to wait until tomorrow. The Chamber of Commerce telegraphs, requesting</p>
<h3 id="e8">Announce the Truth of the Agreement <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government yesterday, requesting that the truth of the Shanghai Armistice Agreement be announced. The original telegram read, "Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Luoyang: In the past, diplomatic precedents have often included secret protocols, declarations, and other documents in addition to the formal text, which have resulted in the loss of rights and the ruin of the country, causing endless harm. There are similar concerns about the Shanghai Armistice Agreement this time. In addition, the Japanese newspapers have spread many rumors, causing the people to become increasingly confused. It is requested that your esteemed Yuan clearly declare that, in addition to the published documents, there are no other secret annexes to this case, in order to dispel public doubts and reassure the people.

<p>The Shanghai Federation of People's Organizations, representing all the people of Shanghai, declares its denial of the humiliating agreement signed with Japan on May 5. "Gentlemen, our nation's people, with the patriotic fervor of historical inheritance and environmental oppression, have been sacrificing their spirit, career, economy, life, and material for the sake of (resisting Japan and saving the country) for seven months since September 18. All sacrifices have been made without hesitation, with the hope of genuinely resisting Japan and achieving final and complete victory. Alas, what hope is there now? On May 5, Guo Taiqi was ordered to sign the so-called armistice agreement with Japan. Upon examination, the entire agreement, in addition to the articles, includes annexes and records of mutual understanding at the meetings. According to reports from Chinese and Japanese newspapers, the substance of this agreement includes all political and military actions within our country's territory, as well as the freedom of speech and action of the people (to resist Japan and save the country), which are all subject to direct and indirect interference within the scope of the agreement. This completely violates Guo Taiqi's responsible statement to our people that he would never accept conditions that would lose rights and humiliate the country, and the government's clear declarations of (determination to resist for a long time) and (no withdrawal of troops, no negotiations). In particular, Guo Taiqi signed secretly, without publicly examining all the articles of the agreement, annexes, and records of mutual understanding prior to signing. Of course, under the revolutionary diplomatic position of the National Government and the political system of the Republic of China with the people as the main body, it is absolutely invalid. In addition to sending telegrams to express our opposition and denial, this association hereby solemnly declares in the newspapers that we will never recognize the entire Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement signed by Guo Taiqi on May 5 under orders. The responsibility for betrayal should be borne solely by Guo Taiqi and those who ordered it. We hope that all the people's organizations for resisting Japan and saving the country, and all compatriots at home and abroad, will unanimously deny it without hesitation. Heaven and earth bear witness to this statement. Shanghai Federation of People's Organizations, May 5 and 6."</p>

<h3 id="e11">A Letter Regarding the Bombing Case <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>▲ Signed by Kim Gu of the Korean Patriotic Corps</p>
<p>▲ Recounts the Assassination Attempt on Japanese Dignitaries: Yesterday, the post office delivered a letter mailed in this port. Upon opening it, it contained an English-typed document entitled (The Truth about the Hongkou Park Bombing Case), and an attached photograph, as shown on the left. The document is translated as follows:</p>
<p>The truth about the Hongkou Park bombing case, which the Japanese side is trying to link to a certain organization in order to achieve its goals, is still shrouded in darkness. Koreans residing in Shanghai have been the first to be hit, being arbitrarily arrested without discrimination or warrants. Koreans in Tokyo and Korea itself have also been affected. I, the instigator of this entire incident, am making the truth known to the world for the sake of humanity and justice, and in the hope of arousing friends to engage in the work of overthrowing Japan's policy of aggression. I am no longer in Shanghai, so I can speak frankly without fear.</p>
<p>▲ Planning and Execution: Ever since Japan annexed Korea by force, and then seized Manchuria and unjustly invaded Shanghai, it has become a threat to peace in the Far East and the whole world. Therefore, I decided to avenge the enemies of world peace and the thieves of humanity and justice. First, I sent Lee Bong-chang to Tokyo to attempt to assassinate the Emperor of Japan on January 8. Next, I sent Yun Bong-gil to Hongkou Park on April 29 to assassinate Japanese military leaders. The details of the Hongkou Park incident are published below: On the morning of April 29, I summoned my young patriotic comrade Yun Bong-gil to my residence and gave him two hand-made bombs. One was to kill the enemy, but I instructed him to only kill Japanese militarists and to avoid harming people from other countries. The other was to be used for suicide after the deed was done to eliminate traces. He solemnly accepted the order and promised to obey my instructions. Then, we shook hands with tears in our eyes, hoping to meet again in the next life. I hired a car and took him to Hongkou Park. He only carried two bombs and four silver coins. I wished him success and said goodbye.</p>
<p>▲ Yun Bong-gil's Brief Biography: Yun Bong-gil was born in Yesan, Korea, in 1908. He came from a poor family. His parents are still alive, and he has a wife and two children. Yun was intelligent as a child and was known as a child prodigy. As he grew older, he witnessed the changes in the world, and his patriotism became increasingly intense. He never forgot to fight. At the age of 17, he set up a night school to teach poor farm children, which he did for five years. Later, seeing that the economic and political oppression of Koreans by the Japanese was becoming increasingly severe, driving Koreans to bankruptcy and death, he decided to avenge the country, left home, and wanted to go to Shanghai. His travel expenses ran out on the way, so he stopped in Qingdao and worked at a laundry operated by the Japanese Nakahara Kanesaburo. After saving some money, he left for Shanghai last August. He first entered a factory, but left his job in anger at the unfair treatment. He then worked at a vegetable store in the Hongkou small vegetable market, waiting for a good opportunity. Recently, he came to see me to discuss ways to save the country. Soon after, he joined the Korean Patriotic Corps.</p>
<p>▲ Contents of the Korean Patriotic Corps: The Korean Patriotic Corps is an organization that I formed by gathering patriotic comrades. Its purpose is to save the motherland by force. Only those who are willing to make the supreme sacrifice are eligible to be members of the Corps. The recommendation and approval of all members is personally decided by me. Therefore, no member of the Corps even knows the names of other members. The Corps does not hold meetings. The conduct of our work is absolutely secret. We plan to assassinate important enemy figures and destroy enemy administrative organs in order to restore the independence of our motherland. We have no money or troops to fight the Taiwanese, but we have (one person) who is prepared and trained to kill them single-handedly in the midst of heavy Japanese guards.</p>
<p>▲ Who am I?: Who am I? Who is writing this? My name is Kim Gu, the person the Japanese are trying so hard to search for and arrest. I am fifty-seven years old. My whole life has been dedicated to saving the country and seeking the permanent freedom of our people. I began my adventurous career in 1896 at the age of twenty-one. In that year, although Korea was an independent country in fact, Japan had already ravaged Seoul and harmed our queen in the palace. The whole country was shocked, and I secretly planned revenge. I followed the traitor Tsuchida to An Yue in Huanghai Province, Korea, and killed him with my bare hands. Then I climbed the nearby city wall and wrote a long letter, stating my name, address, and the reason for the assassination. After finishing, I returned home. Japanese soldiers rode out in all directions, and after twenty days, I was arrested, sent to JIWUPO, and imprisoned. The Korean court was coerced by the Japanese ambassador Hayashi Gonsuke and sentenced me to death, but King Gojong intervened and suspended the sentence for three years. I took the opportunity to escape from prison, disguised myself as a monk, and hid in a remote temple for a year. Then I traveled all over Korea, participating in the enlightenment movement at that time, and founded many new-style schools. In 1909, An Jung-geun assassinated Ito Hirobumi in Harbin. The Japanese arrested and imprisoned me, considering me to be An's close friend. Later, after being released, I became the principal of Yangshan Middle School in An Yue, Huanghai Province. In 1911, I was implicated in the assassination of Governor-General Terauchi, arrested again, and sentenced to fifteen years in prison with hard labor. Fortunately, the Korean police knew my character, and for thirty years, I never revealed my real name, so I was able to save my life. I was released after five years in prison, thanks to several general amnesties that shortened my sentence. In March 1919, the whole country rose up in unison and began the independence movement. Knowing that my life was in danger, I fled to China. Since then, I have fought hard against Japan, but the world powers are unwilling to be enemies with it. My weapons are only a few pistols and many bombs. In the future, I will continue to fight tirelessly until my country regains its independence.</p>

<h3 id="e14">May 9th Commemoration Yesterday <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>▲ Municipal Party Headquarters Convenes a General Assembly: Yesterday was the 17th anniversary of the National Humiliation of May 9th. The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city led various circles in a National Humiliation Commemoration Meeting on the third floor of the headquarters. More than 200 representatives from various institutions and organizations attended, with She Gang presiding and Xu Yefu as the master of ceremonies. The meeting was held as scheduled. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then representatives from various circles made impassioned speeches (omitting the lengthy speeches). The meeting adjourned after the ceremony. The special party headquarters of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways also held a National Humiliation Commemoration Meeting at its temporary office on Tianjin Road yesterday. More than 100 representatives from various institutions and organizations and all working comrades attended. After the meeting was held as scheduled, Committee Member Chen Bohua presided over the meeting and reported on the situation. Then, Comrade Zhang Yunhe gave a speech, which was very impassioned. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Record of a Visit with Sun Ke <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The talk of a Hangzhou meeting between Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Sun Ke to discuss the current situation has been rampant in recent days. External sources have even claimed that the Hangzhou meeting was scheduled to be held yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, our reporter specifically went to Molly Avenue to visit Sun Ke. After entering the Sun residence, the reporter first met Yu Ming. Mr. Yu recently resigned from his position as the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram to persuade him to stay, and Mr. Yu was drafting a reply, firmly expressing his intention to resign. The reporter then went upstairs to Mr. Sun's study and had a brief conversation with Mr. Sun. Mr. Sun told him that he was not aware of the Hangzhou meeting. The reporter then asked Mr. Sun whether there had been any correspondence with Wang Jingwei's side after he published his political views. Mr. Sun replied that Mr. Wang had also advocated democracy in Shanghai, and it seemed unlikely that he would change his position after entering Beijing. However, democracy requires all the people to have the opportunity to participate in politics. There are two ways for the people to participate in politics: local areas should have autonomous organs of people's representatives, and the central government should have deliberative organs freely elected by the people. This is the first point. On the people's side, there must also be groups for political participation movements, that is, political parties. Therefore, other political parties should be allowed to exist outside of the Kuomintang. This is the second point. The participation of Wang and other members of the Kuomintang in politics cannot be said to be the implementation of democracy, but only (dual dictatorship). While opposing dictatorship, dual dictatorship is also not recognized. Mr. Sun finally said that the urgent task of our country is how to advance from rule by man to rule by law, and how to advance from military rule to democracy. Although the political views he recently expressed cannot be immediately realized, they will inevitably be the path to take in the future. The reporter saw Mr. Sun's desk full of Western books and asked what he was studying. Mr. Sun replied that he had no opportunity to study in Beijing, and now that he has leisure time, he is studying the Pacific issue to supplement his lack of learning.</p>

<p>▲ Will Send Personnel to Europe and America to Negotiate Sales</p>
<p>▲ The Future of the Silk and Cocoon Industry is Very Concerning</p>
<p>The Committee for the Reorganization of Aged Filature Silk and Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Filature Silk Sales Committee officially began operations yesterday, setting a deadline for registration, and will send special personnel to Europe and America to negotiate sales. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>▲ Notice for Application</p>
<p>Applicants for registration of aged filature silk must fill in the following items: 1. Applicant, 2. Mailing address, 3. Owner's name, 4. Pledgee, 5. Trademark type, 6.

Number of warehouse receipts, 14. Warehouse receipt number. The application for registration of aged cocoons is roughly the same as above, but it must specify the place of origin, the name of the cocoon market, and the quality, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Registration Method</p>
<p>The Committee for the Reorganization of Aged Filature Silk and Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang issued the following registration methods yesterday: (1) Those who come to the committee to obtain registration application forms must have seals affixed. (2) Applicants for registration must apply for registration within the registration period stipulated by the committee. The government will no longer subsidize aged filature silk and cocoons that are not registered by the deadline. (3) Both the owners of silk and cocoon merchants and the silver houses that have received mortgages can come to the committee to register cocoons. However, one item cannot be registered under two different names. If there is a mortgage relationship, please contact each other to handle it. (4) Applicants for registration must fill in all the items listed in the registration application form as detailed as possible to facilitate investigation procedures and avoid errors and delays. (5) Applicants for registration must also contact the warehouse where the goods are stored. When the committee sends personnel to the warehouse to investigate, verify, and weigh the goods, they should provide convenience and allow the investigators to take a one-pound sample from each lot of dried cocoons. However, the investigator must hold the committee's seal and credentials to be accommodated and guided. (6) If the applicant has a telephone number, please specify it on the application form for easy contact. (7) All applicants must be responsible for the accuracy of the information reported. If any falsehood is found, in addition to not being registered, they will also be severely punished. (8) After receiving the registration application form, the committee will first register it according to the regulations and wait for investigation and verification before issuing a registration receipt for record purposes and easy reference. Applicants should request a receipt from the registration section when submitting the application form, otherwise the committee will not be responsible. (9) For registration of aged cocoons, each application form is limited to one lot for easy verification.</p>
<p>▲ Sales Plan</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met yesterday with a member of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Filature Silk Committee and asked about the sales plan. According to him, after the establishment of the committee, the outline of the sales plan has been drafted: (1) Immediate sale, (2) Export bill negotiation, (3) Consignment sale. However, it is not limited to these. It is stipulated that the storage of filature silk will be tentatively implemented for eight months. If the results are good, it will be decided to change it to a permanent organization. Committee members such as Li Shuchu will be sent to the United States, France, and other countries to negotiate sales. The departure date must be determined by the committee.</p>
<p>▲ Current Situation of the Silk Industry</p>
<p>Among the silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, there are 113 in Shanghai, 38 in Wuxi, and 10 in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Haiyan in Zhejiang Province. Currently, less than one-tenth of them are barely maintaining operation. The European and American silk markets are controlled by Japan, and Chinese silk has plummeted. Currently, B-grade silk is only worth 500 to 550 taels of Chinese silver per picul, while the cost of aged silk is more than 900 taels per picul. Each picul will inevitably lose more than 400 taels. According to the regulations of the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, if the highest cocoon price this spring is calculated at 35 yuan, then the silk produced from fresh cocoons will also be more than 550 taels per picul. Therefore, the future of the silk industry is very concerning.</p>

<p>(Changchun) Sir Lytton met with a group of reporters at the Yamato Hotel yesterday afternoon and made the following remarks: To date, the Investigation Team has inspected Manchuria from both the Japanese and Chinese standpoints. The reason for coming here to meet with the authorities involved in the incident is to learn the truth beyond what has been seen so far and what is reported in the news. That is, to discover what Manchuria itself really demands and how to resolve all the contradictions within Manchuria. Materials provided by all parties are currently being received to see how to carry out the mission. Since the investigation has not been completed, a definitive opinion cannot be expressed. However, if the League of Nations asks me whether the Manchurian issue can be resolved, I dare to answer confidently that a solution can be found. However, the League of Nations does not force a solution on China and Japan, but only hopes for the support of the member states and the two countries. (Electric Communications Society, 9th)</p>

<p>Japanese Barracks Heavily Guarded</p>
<p>He Zhuguo Rejects Japanese Army's Request</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army has decided to occupy Shanhaiguan as soon as the League of Nations Investigation Team leaves Northeast China. (Special dispatch, 9th) (Beiping) The Japanese barracks stationed in Yuguan have been heavily guarded for days, making every effort to deploy military forces. Most of the barracks' artillery positions are facing the city of Yuguan, except for a few facing the station. (Special dispatch, 9th) (Beiping) The Japanese army in Yuguan requested that He Zhuguo sign an agreement allowing them to freely suppress the Volunteer Army within 80 li of Yuguan. He Zhuguo refused, saying that the area within 80 li of Yuguan is the defense zone of the Chinese army. If the Japanese army wants to suppress bandits in this area, they must first obtain the signature of the Chinese military commander, otherwise, the lives and property of the Chinese people will be endangered, and the Japanese must be held responsible. The Japanese army has not yet replied. Yuguan has been under martial law every night from 8:00 p.m. and lifted at 6:00 a.m. the next morning. There are often gunshots at night, which are the Japanese's tricks to disrupt the local area.

The Japanese insisted on using the name of national defense police and remained stationed at the station. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>Guangdong Municipal Party Department Sends a Telegram</p>
<h3 id="e42">Opposing the Armistice Agreement <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Pointing Out Five Major Shortcomings</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Provincial and Municipal Party Departments sent a telegram on the 8th opposing the armistice agreement, listing five major shortcomings of the agreement: (1) The Shanghai incident occurred following the Northeast Incident and should be resolved entirely. The agreement explicitly does not mention the Northeast, which is tantamount to abandoning the Northeast. This does not conform to the three statements made by our representatives in the League of Nations, so-called resolutions of the League of Nations, and should be a solution to the entire dispute. (2) Article 2 of the agreement and the annex limit our right to station troops in the area east of the railway line in the location where our troops are stationed. Moreover, there are no standard methods for restoring normalcy, which is bound to be determined by the will of Japan. That is, if normalcy has not been recognized by Japan, we will not be allowed to station troops in the occupied territories of Shanghai. How is this different from the stipulations of the Boxer Protocol that troops are not allowed to be stationed within 50 li of Tianjin? (3) Article 3 of the agreement and the annex stipulate the temporary location of the Japanese army. The meaning of "temporary" is extremely vague, and the area of the adjacent land is only a general description using maps such as ABC. How long will the territory be and cannot be known by the Chinese people? The so-called withdrawal of Japanese troops is nothing more than a trick for the Japanese to deceive themselves, and the adjacent land may never be recovered. (4) The Songhu Road is an important defense area of our country and should be guarded by troops sent by us. The agreement only stipulates that Japan will not interfere with the Songhu Road, but there is no explicit stipulation on our dispatching troops to protect it. What will happen if Japan interferes? In addition, disabled Japanese soldiers and livestock, along with medical personnel, may remain in place and need our protection, which is tantamount to giving Japan an opportunity to start a war in the future. (5) The stipulations in Articles 1 and 4 of the agreement state that representatives of friendly countries and the joint committee only have the power to investigate and urge attention when there is any negligence in the implementation of Articles 1, 2, and 3, and have no power to enforce implementation. Japan is strong and unreasonable. International treaties, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the resolutions of the League of Nations cannot make it obey. Who would believe that representatives of friendly countries can make it comply by verifying and urging the joint committee to pay attention? In conclusion, the full text of the agreement not only contains political nature but also forfeits national sovereignty. Now, the Volunteer Army is rising up in the Northeast, and the League of Nations is conducting investigations. Japan already finds it difficult to cope. Our government should muster the three armies, encourage the people, and negotiate with Japan, and the integrity of our territory and sovereignty will surely be restored one day. How can we not come up with this plan and secretly sign the agreement? How can the ruling officials shirk their responsibility? The survival of the nation is at stake. Please quickly try to save the situation.</p>

<p>New Postal Rate Measures</p>
<h3 id="e46">June 1st Implementation <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu Discusses Reasons for Price Increases (Nanjing) - The Ministry of Communications announced that postal rates would be increased to alleviate half of the financial burden, effective June 1st. According to a report from the Directorate General of Posts based on information from the Postal Union, China owes various international postal organizations approximately 5 million yuan to date. While there are over 3.9 million yuan in international postal transportation reserve funds set aside for repaying these debts, a portion has already been diverted. The purposes of the price increase are (1) to increase postal transportation tools, (2) to expand the postal route network, (3) to add second and third-class post offices, and (4) to promote rural postal routes. Although the postal savings and postal services are separate, they are essentially interconnected post offices. The deficit is due to the Ministry of Communications using surpluses from the savings bureaus and increasing postal fees to offset postal losses. (Special dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Mingshu told reporters about the postal rate increase: (1) The accumulated losses over the years have been substantial, making it necessary to increase prices to make up for the deficit. (2) It is necessary for developing postal services and completing all equipment needs. Recently, some have criticized the use of postal funds to manage airmail transportation and the establishment of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, claiming they are the sources of postal losses. However, they do not realize that airmail transportation is a social undertaking, and it is currently being reorganized. This falls within the scope of postal services and should be managed comprehensively. The independence of savings and remittances is a common practice in various countries, aiming to develop businesses through specialization and cooperation. It would be a case of "throwing out the baby with the bathwater" to rashly advocate for abolition due to temporary losses. The current increase in the amount is substantial, which was not the original intention. However, the request from the people to reduce or waive the fees has been accepted and submitted to the Executive Yuan, with implementation scheduled for June 1st.

<p>French Second Round of General Election Results</p>
<h3 id="e78">The Left Wing Wins a Great Victory <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>191 More Seats Than the Government Party</p>
<p>Painlevé Joins the Presidential Race</p>
<p>Theodore's Cabinet Likely to Resign</p>
<p>Herriot as Mayor Loves the People Like His Own Children</p>
<p>Communist Leader and Hero of the Black Sea Fails to be Elected This Time</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Paris, 9th - The results of the second round of voting in the French National Assembly show that the Herriot faction has achieved a tremendous victory again. The current Prime Minister Theodore's faction has already admitted defeat after midnight yesterday, saying that this vote clearly indicates that Theodore's third cabinet will resign soon. Since the election reports from various regions arrived in Beijing late yesterday, the victory of the Herriot faction was already clearly visible. By 12:30, the Herriot faction had won 370 seats, while the Theodore faction had only 232 seats, a difference of more than 130 seats. Although some seats have not yet been announced, they will not affect the victory of the Herriot faction. According to the division and rise and fall of French political parties, they are centered on leading figures. Although there are many small parties, they can be roughly divided into six factions: the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party led by Herriot, the Republican Left led by Theodore, the Republican Democratic Union led by Marin, and the remnants of the extreme right-wing monarchist party. Among them, the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party are known as the left wing, while the Republican Left and the Republican Democratic Union are known as the right wing. In this election, the Radical Socialist Party and the Socialist Party joined hands. The aforementioned Herriot faction refers to these two major parties. The Theodore faction refers to the right-wing parties that jointly form the current government.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Paris, 9th - Today, the lower-level official departments announced the revised general election results. The Herriot faction won a total of 389 seats, exceeding the majority of the entire assembly. The Theodore faction only won 198 seats. Now that the second election results have been announced and the left wing has won a great victory, whether the President of the Senate, Lebrun, can be elected president tomorrow is no longer as stable as it was before. The radical newspaper "La République" claims that if the new parliament opens tomorrow, the Theodore cabinet will be overthrown. The current old parliament can no longer represent public opinion. When electing the president tomorrow, this must be taken into account. Another radical newspaper, "L'Intransigeant," said that the left wing will abandon its original intention of not nominating a presidential candidate. Painlevé has agreed to be nominated as the second presidential candidate. Also, all French newspapers today are speculating about the impact of the election on the cabinet, believing that Theodore will not be able to be re-elected in the future without the support of the Radical Socialist Party. The leader of the Radical Socialist Party, Herriot, is generally considered to be the next prime minister. Although Herriot has not made any clear statements at this time, he only said that he will no longer lightly form a cabinet as he did in 1924 with only the tacit support of the Socialist Party. However, it is generally believed that this remark indicates that Herriot is willing to form a cabinet if he receives the active support of the Socialist Party. The attitude of the Socialist Party shows that it is preparing to abandon its long-standing passive policy and share the responsibilities of the government. It is rumored that negotiations have begun between the various left-wing parties this morning. Roughly, Herriot's attitude can be determined after the negotiations are completed. If the left-wing parties cannot form a coalition cabinet, there is still the possibility of cooperation between the Radical Socialist Party and the Theodore faction.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 9th - The results of the second round of voting in the French National Assembly are a victory for the left-wing parties. It is expected that Theodore will resign when the Chamber of Deputies reconvenes. However, the selection of the new government is still unpredictable. However, France's attitude towards current international issues, in any case, cannot be changed. Although Herriot is more moderate, he agrees with Theodore on issues such as disarmament, reparations, and war debts.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 8th - Painlevé's associates claim that after the French general election, looking around the country, the one most capable of presiding over everything to realize the unity of the parliament and the government's republicans is Painlevé. Therefore, they have indeed strongly invited Painlevé to be a presidential candidate. Last night, Painlevé and the leader of the Radical Socialist Party, Herriot, spoke on the phone. It is rumored that Herriot has agreed to provide assistance to him personally and from the Radical Party.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 9th - Theodore and his cabinet will resign tomorrow night. Former Prime Minister Painlevé declared today that he is willing to be a presidential candidate.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Paris, 8th - After the landslide victory in the election, Herriot, as the mayor of Lyon, personally supervised the rescue efforts after a cliff collapsed in the suburbs of Lyon today, risking serious injury twice. The first time the earth and rocks collapsed, Herriot was only a few inches away from being buried. The second time a huge rock fell, the fire chief was fortunate to push Herriot away, avoiding disaster. However, the fire chief fractured his kneecap. Herriot's love for the people is evident in his willingness to risk his life to rescue those trapped in collapsed apartments.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 8th - Among those who were not elected yesterday, there is the Communist candidate Marty, who is known as the "Hero of the Black Sea." The so-called Hero of the Black Sea refers to the winter of 1918, when Marty was still a sailor and instigated a mutiny to prevent a French warship in the Black Sea from bombarding a certain city, thus earning the title.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Gou's Wife Continues Interrogation <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>No Suspicion of Complicity</p>
<p>Gou Made a Will Before Leaving Home to Prevent Accidents</p>
<p>French Police Are Investigating Whether He Was Funded by Russia</p>
<p>French Government Claims Gou is a Communist</p>
<p>Russian Newspapers Believe it Contains Political Undertones</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 8th - Gou's wife has now arrived here from Monaco, dressed in black and appearing very flustered. She told the police that her husband had never had any nervous disorders, and he was devoutly religious and often went to church. It is unbelievable that he could commit such a crime. When he left Monaco, he only said that he was going to Paris to sell books and made a will before leaving to prevent any unexpected events. She said he always carried two guns for self-defense. The police are now eager to find out whether Gou received any subsidies from any Russian political party. Giraud, who defended political assassins in 1914, has now been appointed as Gou's defense lawyer. The son of British Prime Minister MacDonald has now arrived here to represent his father in offering condolences to the family of the late President and Theodore. The remains of the late President will be buried tomorrow according to his wife's wishes. Hundreds of thousands of Parisians passed by the presidential palace today after casting their votes and paid their respects. According to reports from London, the British Prince will represent the British Emperor in carrying the coffin for the late President.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Paris, 8th - Today, the wife of Gou, the assassin of the French President, was not charged as an accomplice but temporarily detained as an important witness in the case. According to her statement during the official interrogation today, she was married in Paris last year and had a dowry of 40,000 francs. Her husband had recently abandoned all political ambitions and devoted himself to his profession, burying himself in writing books. However, according to semi-official sources, the police suspect that Gou's wife's explanation of the source of Gou's current cash and bank deposits is an excuse and that it must have been provided by a foreign political organization.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Paris, 9th - Today, officials continued to interrogate Gou's wife. According to her statement, Gou claimed that he had used his wife's dowry of 40,000 francs, and he had been very short of money recently. It is expected that this was also one of the reasons that prompted him to decide to commit the assassination. After the interrogation, Gou's wife was released, but she is not allowed to leave Paris during the period of the dowry case.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Moscow, 8th - After the assassination of French President Doumer, the Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a message stating that the murderer, Russian Gou, was a member of the Communist Party. Russian newspapers are therefore extremely angry. Russian newspapers instead accused Gou of being a White Russian and said that the French government had always protected White Russians and that Doumer's assassination was the result of this policy. The official newspaper of the Soviet Union claimed that the French strongly claimed that Gou was a member of the Communist Party and fabricated facts, which undoubtedly contained political undertones, hoping to stir up public sentiment and enable the right-wing party to win in this general election. The Communist Party's newspaper claimed that the masterminds behind Doumer's assassination were not in Russia but in Paris.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Brussels, 8th - (The Belgian newspaper "L'Indépendance Belge") recently learned from its correspondent in the Czech capital about the following information about the murderer Gou: (Gou was not unknown among the Russian expatriates in Prague. Gou occupied an important position among the secret envoys sent out by Moscow. According to well-informed sources, Gou served as a soldier in the Russian Cossack regiment during the European War. After the war, he disappeared. One thing that can be determined is that Gou's name was not in the list of White Russian soldiers under General Langshell who opposed the Reds. Ten years ago, he appeared in Romania again. Soon the Soviet government allowed him to return to Russia quickly and received a Moscow passport. He immediately pretended to leave, but a few days later, it was rumored that Gou was executed after returning to Russia. "L'Indépendance Belge" also learned from another source that Gou had studied tropical medicine in Brussels, Belgium, in order to act as a Soviet Russian envoy to the Belgian Congo.)</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Paris, 9th - Dimitri, a White Russian exile, committed suicide today by jumping from the sixth-floor window of his apartment. He left a note to the police, saying that he felt ashamed to face the world again because he was worried and angry that his comrade had assassinated the French President.</p>

<p>A Sailor Sneaks Ashore to Report</p>
<p>President Personally Leads a Large Army to Suppress</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New York, 8th - The Peruvian cruiser Bolognesi, anchored in Callao, mutinied last night. Officers below the captain were all detained by the mutineers. Another warship also rebelled in succession, but a sailor snuck ashore, reported to the authorities. The troops in Lima, the capital, rushed to Callao, to prevent the mutineers from landing. It is generally believed that the mutiny of the two warships was instigated by the Communists. It is rumored that the Communists planned to revolt simultaneously in various parts of South America yesterday. The Peruvian government had received warnings from London. A telegram from Lima only mentioned the mutiny of the Bolognesi, and did not mention the other warship. It is said that the mutineers tried to land, but failed. Later, the government ordered to shoot with torpedoes. The mutineers knew it was difficult to resist and surrendered. After the incident, the government announced martial law. A telegram from Lima said that local order is now peaceful as usual.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Peruvian capital, 8th - The Peruvian Communist Party revolted and occupied two cruisers. Peruvian President Cerro personally led the army, navy and air force to attack, resolved its landing forces, and then attacked from top and bottom with aircraft and torpedo boats, and then retook the two ships and arrested the rebels. Their leader, Polay, was a communist, has also been arrested. All are now detained on San Lorenzo Island, pending trial by a military court. According to the official announcement, this uprising is part of a socialist revolution plan, and they intend to rise up throughout South America, involving 100 million people.</p>

<p>Should Not Be Regarded As Worthless</p>
<p>Churchill Advises Britain and the United States to Pay Attention Together</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, London, 8th - Today, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill gave a radio speech to the United States, urging cooperation between British and American monetary policies to prevent destructive inflation (excessive issuance of banknotes). The main points of his speech are roughly as follows: The world's gold has been gathered in one corner, hoarded and not dispersed, resulting in a 70% increase in gold prices in the past five years, while all commodity prices, including silver, have fallen. The extreme disparity between gold and silver prices should have been a concern for world politicians long ago. Silver is still the currency of 100 million people and should not be regarded as potatoes and turnips without attention.</p>

The secretary replied that Japan has no intention of waging war against Russia or any other country, but the representatives insisted on seeing Matsudaira before agreeing to leave the embassy. Finally, the police pushed them out of the embassy.</p>

<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Moscow, 8th - After being warmly welcomed in Russia, the Turkish delegation set off from Moscow today to return home. Turkish Prime Minister Ismet and Foreign Minister Lusht accompanied government officials in a special train to Odessa, where they transferred to a ferry across the Black Sea. Russian government officials went to the station to see them off, and a military station team was dispatched, with extremely grand etiquette. Before departure, Turkish Foreign Minister Lusht met with Russian newspaper reporters. After expressing his gratitude for the enthusiastic welcome of the Russian people, he claimed that one of the concrete results of this trip was to negotiate a deferred payment of 8 million yuan to Turkey so that Turkey could purchase Russian-made machinery. The machinery will mainly consist of plows and textile machines. The loan is guaranteed by the Turkish government and will be repaid within 15 years without paying cash but by Russia selecting Turkish products as compensation.</p>

<p>Holds May 9th Commemoration ▲Wang Jingwei Presents Two Important Reports ▲Establishment of Public Opinion Organs during the Tutelage Period ▲The Course of Signing the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement</p>
<p>The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters' office in Nanjing held a May 9th National Humiliation Commemoration Meeting at 9:00 AM. More than 600 people attended, including Wang Zhaoming, Shao Yuanchong, Shi Qingyang, Chen Lifu, Zhou Qigang, Chen Bijun, Fang Juehui, Shi Ying, Miao Peicheng, Li Zonghuang, Deng Feihuang, Yang Hu, Chen Fumu, Hong Ludong, Zeng Kuoqing, Zhou Zuomin, Xiao Jishan, and Gu Zhenggang.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei reported, roughly stating: "Today is the May 9th National Humiliation Commemoration, and it is also the weekly commemoration of the Premier. I have been entrusted by the Central Committee to report two matters to you comrades: (1) the issue of establishing a central public opinion organ during the period of political tutelage; (2) the course of signing the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement. Regarding the first item, the Central Political Council has held two formal meetings and two discussion meetings, conducting detailed discussions. Although a complete decision has not yet been made, firstly, everyone agrees that a central public opinion organ should be established; secondly, the majority opinion favors using the name 'National Political Participation Council' rather than 'National Assembly'; thirdly, after the central public opinion organ is established, elected legislative and supervisory members should be dismissed to avoid duplication. Everyone should know that this is an important task to complete political tutelage and achieve constitutional government and should pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>Regarding the second item, the full text of the agreement has been published in various newspapers, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs has also issued a statement, which everyone must have seen. In summary, there are about three points I can tell you: (1) this agreement is entirely for a ceasefire and troop withdrawal and has no political nature; (2) the Northeast issue will not cease negotiations because of this; (3) the Chinese side has sent police to take over the lost territories. Everyone must know that diplomacy depends on military strength, military strength depends on economic, cultural, and all scientific equipment, and all of these depend on politics. Politics is the foundation of everything. In the future, we will continue to maintain a policy of negotiating on one hand and resisting on the other," etc.</p>

<p>Opinions on the Far East Issue</p>
<p>▲Has Gained Sympathy from Heads of State ▲But if You Want to Solve the Problem ▲It Must Undergo Extremely Strong Patience</p>
<p>▲The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that Stimson, who was active on the international stage in Geneva under the guise of promoting the disarmament conference, hurriedly returned to the United States because it was contrary to expectations. When he was in Bremersville, he answered the American reporters' conversation as follows: "The issues I discussed in Geneva, the disarmament conference, have been successful. Other issues such as the Far East issue, which has mutual interest relations with various countries, have gained the sympathy of the heads of state and are also very beneficial. However, the solution of the problem in the future still needs to go through time and extremely strong patience," etc.</p>
<p>▲The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reported that US Secretary of State Stimson had already started his journey home on the 1st. Regarding the Manchuria issue, he already had a considerable understanding with British Prime Minister MacDonald. MacDonald said that when the Manchuria issue occurred, he was ill and did not personally deal with it, which caused the British attitude to be somewhat weak. Fortunately, now it has been agreed with the United States, and the United Kingdom and the United States can ensure closer coordination than before when dealing with the Manchuria issue in the future. Today, the Manchuria issue is about to be submitted to the League of Nations. Because of the coordination between the United Kingdom and the United States, it is worth noting to what extent the Far East policy will ultimately be transformed.</p>

<p>▲Continuous Rain and Rising Yangtze River Water Level ▲Wutai Sluice Gate is Dangerous and Rescue is Being Prepared</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The floods in Hubei Province last year were most severe in Wuhan. The prosperous markets were completely turned into swamps, and the number of people affected by the disaster was more than 770,000, with property losses of tens of millions. People from all walks of life, looking back on that time, never fail to talk about the flood with pale faces. An investigation into the causes of the flood reveals about several points: (1) continuous heavy rain for ten days, sharply increasing the amount of water, and the rivers could not accommodate it; (2) the Yangtze River was blocked, and the huge amount of water could not flow smoothly; (3) the levees were not strong; (4) the rescue was not effective. Although the authorities traced the source after the incident, trying to find a once-and-for-all solution, such as suggesting dredging the Yangtze River, planning to consolidate the levees, and planning to build a flood-proof road around the city, etc., it was ultimately hindered by the situation in Fujian. It was decided that Li commanding officers Huang Renhuan and Huang Yanzhen would take two divisions and hurry into Fujian. According to the intelligence obtained by the provincial government, after the two divisions of Huang Renhuan and Huang Yanzhen recovered Yongding, they advanced towards Longyan. Now they have arrived at Dachih and Xiaochih. The Red Bandits in Zhangzhou are in a state of emergency and have transferred all the troops of Mao Zedong, the fake first army, and Huang Zhongyue, the fake 15th army, to Nan Jing to cooperate with Peng Dehuai's fake fifth army, hoping to resist stubbornly. The outposts of the two sides started contact on the 1st of this month. Currently, there are only more than 1,000 local Red Bandits in Zhangzhou City, specializing in distributing rice and collecting money to supply the front line. Generally speaking, if the Red Bandits lose in Longyan, Zhangzhou will be abandoned. As for the Red Bandits, the fake 8th Army under Luo Binghui, in the west of Fujian, took advantage of the tense situation in southern Fujian to unite with local bandits and approached Jianning, Qingliu, and Guihua. Currently, Lu Xingbang's division is guarding Guihua and Qingliu, and Zhou Zhiqun's brigade is guarding Jianning, strictly preventing Luo's bandits from fleeing in. Liu Heding's division concentrated the two brigades of Gui Zhenyuan and Jiang Yan in Shunchang Jiang Le, as a rear response. Yesterday, the chief of staff of the division headquarters, Wang Jicheng, came to the province to report the deployment in northern Fujian to Fang Shengtao. It is reported that in addition to sending Chen Weiyuan, the chief of staff of the Provincial Security Department, to Quanzhou, to discuss the deployment of southern Fujian with Chen Guohui, the brigade commander of the First Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, and Han Huirong, the chief of staff of the 49th Division, Fang Shengtao himself plans to go to Quanzhou for inspection within a few days. However, according to today's newspaper, Xu Kexiang's division of Zhu Shaoliang's 6th Route Army, which was ordered to aid Fujian, has already been spent and the decision was not implemented.</p>
<p>Time passes quickly, and a year has passed. The blockage of the river remains the same, the damage to the levees remains the same, the market has not recovered at all, and many victims have not been resettled. However, in recent days, continuous heavy rain has caused the river to gradually rise, and the Wutai Sluice Gate in Wuchang has been presenting a dangerous situation. The citizens, having suffered greatly, are all deeply worried about this. The Water Conservancy Bureau is also very concerned about this. In addition to preparing for rescue, it is also planning this year's flood prevention plan and submitting it to the provincial government for review and approval. The original submission is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Within the Wuhan urban area, the flood prevention projects, except for the entire Hankou and Zihu levee in Wuchang, which have been undertaken by the Hubei Flood Relief Rehabilitation Committee, other places have those that should be repaired in advance, and those that should be protected at any time. However, the rise and fall of the water are unpredictable, and the highest water level this year cannot be predicted. Now, if the basic flood prevention projects cannot be completed entirely, and the flood prevention matters are planned in advance, it will inevitably be a temporary panic, and it is difficult to guarantee safety. If the bureau is solely responsible, then the bureau's responsibility is to manage the water conservancy of the entire province, and it cannot focus all its efforts on the corner of Wuhan. If the chambers of commerce or public works institutions of the three towns are responsible, then flood prevention is tied to the safety of Wuhan, and this matter is of great importance. It is still not thorough to handle it by only a few agencies. After careful consideration, if this year's water level rises to 47 feet on the Jianghan Customs water gauge, it is planned to organize the Wuhan Temporary Flood Prevention Committee by the following agencies and groups, in accordance with the temporary organization of the levee repair and flood prevention committee of the Construction Department last year, so that we can cooperate with each other and not be hasty. The proposed method is as follows: (1) The Wuhan Temporary Flood Prevention Committee is composed of the Hubei Construction Department, the Hubei Water Conservancy Bureau, the Hankou Municipal Government, the Hankou Public Security Bureau, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, the Hubei Dike Construction Fund Management Committee, six agencies, and the three chambers of commerce of Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang, each sending personnel to organize it, and its chairman and members will be temporarily appointed. (2) Under the committee, there are three offices: General Affairs, Accounting, and Engineering. The General Affairs Office is undertaken by the Hankou Public Security Bureau, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, and the Wuyang Han three chambers of commerce, handling documents, procurement, communication, transportation, and recruitment. The Accounting Office is undertaken by the Hubei Levee Construction Fund Management Committee, handling cashiers and accounting. The Engineering Office is undertaken by the Hubei Construction Department, the Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Hankou Municipal Government, handling engineering matters. In addition to the aforementioned project plans and estimates for repairs and protections, which will be submitted by the bureau in a special case, if the water level of this year's Wuhan flood prevention affairs rises to 47 feet on the Jianghan Customs water gauge, it is proposed to organize the Wuhan Temporary Flood Prevention Committee to be responsible for handling the reasons, whether it is appropriate, and it is appropriate to submit a document to your government for verification and compliance) (May 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Changshu After the Ceasefire <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, various groups have been organized in this county, such as the Civilian Rescue Team and the Local Maintenance Association, which were quite excited. Now that the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement has been signed by both sides, the groups have begun to prepare to end everything. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Refugees Will Be Sent Back to Their Hometowns</p>
<p>The local Red Cross Society sent relief teams to Taicang, Luduqiao, Yanglinkou and other places at the beginning of the war to rescue refugees. More than a thousand people were rescued, mostly women and children. After arriving in Changshu, the society set up the first and second reception centers to accommodate them. The issue of supplies was donated by the local enthusiasts to the association, which has been more than two months. Now that the ceasefire agreement has been signed, the refugees want to return home and have asked the directors to find ways to send them back to their hometowns. Yesterday, the reporter met with Yu Jiusi, the director of the association, who said that although the ceasefire agreement has been signed, the Japanese army on the front line has not been removed, and there are concerns that there may be further complications when the refugees return. It is now planned to send an investigation team of Cai Wenqiao and others to conduct a proper reconnaissance before sending them back to their hometowns separately.</p>
<p>▲Local Maintenance Association Issues Commemorative Medals</p>
<p>After the Fifth Army resisted the enemy at Miaohang, it was ordered to come to Changshu for recuperation. At that time, the 47th, 87th, and 88th divisions arrived in Changshu and were stationed there. For the convenience of all parties to make contact, the county government convened various agencies, groups, and local gentry to organize a local maintenance committee, with the county magistrate, the head of the public security bureau, the president of the chamber of commerce, and the party committee member taking turns to serve as executive officers, specializing in contacting the army, dealing with ships, stationed locations, and procurement, etc. All the clerks are working around the clock. Now that the end of the work is approaching, the association has made various commemorative medals for the officers, all of whom are volunteers, and will be distributed at the end of the work as a souvenir. As for the expenses of the association, including the construction of the former office, etc., it is about more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Civilian Rescue Team is About to Return to Changshu</p>
<p>When the front-line war broke out, the general young patriots of this county, in view of the fact that our army bravely killed the enemy, but occasionally were injured and lacked treatment, there was the organization of the civilian rescue team, with more than 40 participants. Later, some of them went to Taicang in order to work on the ground. At that time, the 19th Route Army stationed there was short of such talents and was very welcomed, and was ordered to be incorporated into the team under the command of the 156th Brigade. When there was a small contact at the front, the team followed the army to perform rescue work. Now that the major event is roughly over, the volunteer army of various routes has been ordered to return, and the Civilian Rescue Team has also been ordered by the 19th Route Army to return to Changshu immediately. It is heard that the people in this question will open a welcome meeting when the team returns to Changshu to praise the team for its national efforts, and ask to report the situation on the front line.</p>
<p>▲Special Rescue Team Will Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Red Cross Society organized a rescue team, with as many as 22 teams, after the January 28 Incident occurred. Later, after our army retreated to the second line of defense, the association merged the 22 teams into a special rescue team, with 80 to 90 team members, and appointed Zhang Zhenyan as the captain to go to Suzhou to prepare for work. Later, I don’t know why the entire team was transferred to Changshu and stationed in the Qu's ancestral hall in Zhucaobang. Captain Zhang soon went to Yixing, and the front line was also quite quiet, and there was nothing to do. Now it is also in the process of sorting out and will soon return to Shanghai.</p>

<p>▲Returning to Songjiang to Avoid Disaster Suddenly Suffers a Huge Theft</p>
<p>Since the Songhu war occurred, the Japanese planes have come to Songjiang to scout from time to time, causing those with a little fortune to move their belongings to Shanghai. Now that the ceasefire agreement has been signed, those who moved to Shanghai have successively moved back, and luggage has been carried back and forth, causing bandits to covet. Last night (7th), the tenant surnamed Qian in the Li house in Ai Jiaqiao in the city suddenly reported a theft, losing 1,500 yuan in banknotes and about 2,000 yuan in valuable clothes. According to the Qian surname, he had just moved back from Shanghai on that day and suffered this huge theft, and he was extremely frustrated.</p>

<p>▲Impersonating a Reporter to Collect Money Exposed</p>
<p>Shao Bofang, the owner of Zhao Tang Coal Yard Nongkou Tianbao Inn, was arrested by Li Xiongbiiao, the Fifth Team of the Railway Artillery Team of the Land, Sea and Air Force at 2 pm on the 1st of this month. It is heard that the reason for his arrest was actually due to the owner of a certain number in that place purchasing military hemp bags by mistake. Shao's wife, Yang, was very anxious after learning about it. At that time, Chu Boqin, a native of Liyang, impersonated a reporter from Mingbao Newspaper and claimed to Shao Yang that this matter was very small and that he could find a way to bail him out, so there was no need to worry, but he needed 200 yuan. At the same time, Tang Shuji, the owner of De Tai Tin Foil Shop in Jiangyin Lane, and Hua Fengshan, the owner of Rifengyuan Noodle Restaurant in Coal Yard Lane, also said that Chu Boqin could be asked to find a way. Shao Yang believed it when she heard the words, so she borrowed 200 yuan from the Huzhentai Rice Shop in Fangxi and agreed with Shao's friend Zhang Wenxuan and Duan Youjian to hand over the money to Chu et al. at the Minsheng Building Teahouse near the station and explained that in addition to the 200 yuan, they would need to send an additional reward of 100 yuan and Chu Boqin 50 yuan, limited to noon that day. After the agreement was reached, Chu immediately took the money to the Yuejia car, not knowing what kind of hookup he was doing. Half an hour later, Li ordered Shao Yang to find three guarantors to bail Shao Bofang home. By the next day, Chu went to Shao's house to thank Shao, Shao refused sternly because the circumstances were suspicious. It lasted for three days and still could not be formally resolved. The matter was detected by Qin Hongye, the backbone of Mingbao Newspaper, and because it was related to the reputation of all newspaper reporters and this newspaper, he reported to the fifth branch of the Public Security Bureau for investigation at 8 am the day before. Director Peng arrested Chu Boqin according to the report and summoned the principal Shao Yang to the bureau, transferred it to the head office, and forwarded it to the prosecutor's office of the county court. After the prosecutor Du opened the court, he ordered Shao Yang to send him back, Chu Boqin was detained and awaited trial.</p>

<p>▲Road Association Investigates Fraud</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Road Promotion Branch has been established for five days in the Zhaozong Ancestral Hall on Zhong Street. The association discovered that He Shipan, the chief executive, had used the name of the association to go to Rixin Tuo to privately print the sea gate mu donation receipt book and forge documents in an attempt to defraud money. The executive director meeting decided to send He to the county government for questioning and went to Rixin Studio to find the evidence. Magistrate Ma questioned him at night and ordered him to be imprisoned and await trial.</p>

<p>▲Execution of Police Captain for Colluding with Bandits</p>
<p>Liu Zhongzhi, the captain of the third squad of the Huaiyin County Police, was originally the company commander under Ma Yuren during the warlord era and was in secret communication with bandits in various counties in Huai, supplying the bandits with guns and ammunition. After Ma's failure, he went elsewhere for a while. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, he was filled with his current position due to the reputation of a certain director in Huaiyin, and was assigned to Songji and other places in this county. He recruited bandit leaders Ding Zhaohuai, Zheng Xuewu, Wu Xingfang, etc. as disciples, privately lent the public and private guns under his control to bandits to rob people, and harbored hostages and demanded fields. There were many accumulated cases, and the villagers were afraid of his power and dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. A month ago, the Wang Yanshen Brigade of Liang Guanying's 25th Route Army was ordered to suppress the bandits in various counties in Jiangbei. After detecting Liu's bad deeds and hearing that bandit leaders Ding Zhaohuai and others were hiding in his house, he immediately sent a team to Liu's residence in Dupaifang to search and arrest them. Ding and others had already fled upon hearing the news. Liu was arrested, submitted to the headquarters for questioning and found to be true, and was immediately sentenced to death according to law. At 11 am today (3rd), Liu was brought to court for identification, tied up and taken to the Qingyang small railway station, and executed by shooting.</p>

<p>▲Beijing-Wuhu Liner Robbed Midway</p>
<p>The small liners operating on the Yangtze River in Wuhu have been repeatedly robbed by bandits, and there is no good way to prevent it. Merchants and travelers regard it as a dangerous place. Yesterday, the Wu Ning Liner of the Nanjing-Wuhu class Xifeng Company sailed from Beijing to Wuhu, carrying many passengers. At one hour and three quarters in the morning, when it was near Heshanggang downstream of Caishi, four bandits suddenly appeared, with three pistols and a broadsword in total. Two people jumped into the old big house and ordered them to turn around and open downstream. They immediately began to search, back and forth as many as seven or eight times. No one on the entire ship was spared. There was a certain head of the Dangtu Wounded Soldiers Hospital who received 2,500 yuan in supplies and a box cannon in Beijing, and the travel expenses of hundreds of female students from Wuwei Visiting Group and more than 700 liang of raw opium of a certain soil dealer were all searched. There was also an old woman who was shot in the breast and died on the spot while arguing with the robbers for three silver coins. The small liner was forced to spin in the river, and viewers on both sides were blocking the river. Two hours later, they carried the stolen goods onto a rowboat and escaped. At that time, one of the robbers wearing a suit accidentally fired his box cannon when getting off the rowboat because he was carrying too many stolen goods, injuring his leg. After the bandits boarded the boat and left the wheel, the self-defense groups of Dangtu and He County opened fire on both sides to pursue them. Until 9 pm, the small liner arrived in Wuhu, and the estimated loss was more than 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Wu Zhaogang's department of the 10th Route Army of the Liaoning Volunteer Army has more than 20,000 people, with complete guns and horses. Since the Shenyang Incident, it has repeatedly fought fiercely with Japan, such as the Jinxi Xingcheng Xinmin Liuhegou and other battles, and has won considerable victories. It is now heard that the department wants the compatriots in the south to understand the recent situation in the Northeast, and has specially sent Xu Jinyai, the political minister of the department, Xiao Ruipeng, the investigation section chief of the political department, Li Xinming, the secretary-general, Wu Zhidong and Yang Shijie, the adjutant office, and Liu Xinyuan, the communicator, etc. to Shanghai to report on the anti-Japanese experience and ask for assistance from all walks of life.</p>

<p>▲Regarding the Secret Order to Arrest Representatives</p>
<p>Because the representatives of the various groups had an audience with Foreign Vice Minister Guo Taiqi a few days ago, there was a misunderstanding that caused the use of force. At that time, Guo was quite willing not to investigate, but the foreign consultant Xia Qifeng secretly ordered the arrest of the representatives, causing the representatives to suffer greatly. Moreover, Xia had firmly stated that he would never want to witness the signing of the humiliating treaty, so yesterday afternoon, he sent a letter to Xia Qifeng to question him.</p>
<h3 id="e101">19th Route Army Has No Air Force Organization <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of the 19th Route Army organizing an air force, which was published in yesterday's Chinese and foreign newspapers, this reporter went to the rear office of the 19th Route Army to inquire. According to the responsible staff there, the air force is a part of the national defense forces and must have an overall plan. It must also be planned in its entirety by the central government. No military force can act on its own. The 19th Route Army has absolutely no plan for this matter. As for the overseas Chinese in various ports, although some wanted to help this army with airplanes during the Sino-Japanese war, this army had no airfield at that time and lacked the necessary equipment. Overseas Chinese were separately notified by telegram to send the donations to the central government for reception. The current situation is not known in detail, but the so-called reception of airplanes donated by overseas Chinese is not factual. As for Zhang Huichang's visit to Shanghai, although he met with Chiang Kai-shek and Cai Tingkai, they never discussed the organization of an air force. It is ridiculous that the Chinese and foreign newspapers are widely reporting that the 19th Route Army appointed Zhang Huichang, Ding Ji, and Xu as the commander and deputy commanders of the air force, respectively.

<p>When the Sino-Japanese situation was urgent, the Ministry of Transportation ordered the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau to consult with the Shipping Association and the Da Lai Company. The company's ships would carry poor overseas Chinese students back to the country each time they passed through Japan. It was agreed that the fare for those boarding in Yokohama would be reduced to 27 yuan per person, and 23 yuan for those boarding in Kobe. It was scheduled to be implemented immediately. However, according to the Maritime Affairs Bureau yesterday, since the armistice agreement has been signed, commerce can gradually recover. Therefore, the Da Lai ship's plan to carry overseas Chinese students back to the country has been suspended.</p>

<p>▲Zhang Mingyuan Sentenced to Life Imprisonment ▲Zhou Gan臣 and Others Released</p>
<p>Li Mingzhong and eleven others, the initiators of the Southeast Self-Defense Army, were secretly reported to the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Director Wen dispatched detectives to cooperate with concession detectives to arrest more than ten people separately at the Dadong Hotel and other places. After being interrogated by the Judicial Section of the bureau, they were sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. After further detailed questioning by Wang Yi, the Chief of the Military Law Department of the headquarters, Li and the other eleven people, as well as the case files and evidence, were transferred to the Military and Political Department of Nanjing. After separate interrogations by Wang Zhennan, the Chief of the Military Law Division, Li Mingzhong, Jiang Mingji, and Zhang Mingyuan confessed that there was sufficient evidence of internal strife. They were sent to the Second Isolation Room of the prison department of the department in Sanyuan Lane and detained. A request was submitted to Chiang Kai-shek, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, for punishment. The crime committed by the suspect was endangering the Republic of China, and an order was given to execute them separately. Therefore, on the morning of May 2nd, the department brought Li Mingzhong and Jiang Mingji to the execution ground in front of the Second Isolation Room of the prison department for execution by firing squad after the execution office verified their identities. Zhang Mingyuan was sentenced to life imprisonment. The rest, Zhou Gan臣, Sun Yushu, Song Botao, Yin Yuting, etc., were all released.</p>

<p>This reporter visited Mayor Wu Tiecheng to inquire about the contents of the important declaration that would be issued in Guangdong, as the Shanghai armistice agreement was established, and the reshuffling of the air and naval forces in Guangdong was trending towards expansion. Mayor Wu said that the dispute in Guangdong's air and naval forces was due to the reorganization issue that occurred before the Shanghai armistice agreement. It was entirely an internal issue in Guangdong and had nothing to do with the overall situation, and the situation had gradually eased. Comrades in Guangdong had already said that all military forces would no longer participate in the civil war, so it should not expand. If Guangdong withdraws the troops that had already entered Fujian and Jiangxi to suppress bandits due to internal turmoil, then the bandit suppression work in Fujian and Jiangxi will be somewhat affected. Today (i.e., the 9th), various newspapers published a section of the New Voice News reporter's speech regarding Guangdong matters, which is surprising. In fact, I have never made any speeches about Guangdong matters to any reporters before today.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods, and the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation held a joint meeting on the second floor of the Commodity Exhibition Hall. More than ten representatives, including Wang Jiean, Lu Xingzhuang, Sun Chucheng, Zhang Dezhai, Zhu Boyuan, Zhu Zhenhan, Chen Yiting, Zhu Dechao, and Zhong Jinchen, attended. After a long discussion, they all agreed that since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai's national goods factories have been devastated. If national goods are not actively promoted to awaken the public's psychology, foreign goods will inevitably take advantage of the situation. It was resolved that the five national goods groups would initiate a national goods exhibition with a sales department so that the audience could recognize national goods. The Commodity Exhibition Hall will draft a specific plan, and then gather various groups to conduct a detailed study. Then, the factory representatives meeting will be convened to discuss the date.</p>

Yesterday, the joint federation of organizations notified all organizations to postpone sending representatives to the pier to welcome her, so as not to make futile trips. After the date is determined, a further notice will be issued.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Ren Luping Dies of Illness <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>▲The Coffin Will Be Sealed This Afternoon Ren Luping, the director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, died at about 1:30 PM the day before yesterday. He participated in the closing ceremony of the Kangjiaqiao War Zone Refugee Shelter. He made a speech on stage and took pictures. While talking to the guests and drinking tea, he suddenly felt dizzy and fell to the ground. The attendant police officers immediately helped him back to his residence in Minzhili, Hatong Road, but he was unconscious. Famous Chinese and Western doctors were immediately called for treatment. It was said that it was a cerebral hemorrhage, or a stroke. The treatment was ineffective, and he passed away at 8:40 PM. The coffin will be sealed today (the 10th) at 1 PM, and the funeral will be held on the afternoon of the 12th. Ren's given name is Xiechen, and he was nearly forty years old. He was from Henan and served in the police force for many years. He was honest, straightforward, and his integrity was admirable. When Dai Shifu was the director, Ren was the inspector. Because of his diligence in handling affairs, he was soon appointed as the director of the Second Branch of the Second District in Nanshi. When Director Yuan took office, Ren's achievements were even more remarkable. Before long, he was promoted to the director of the Seventh District, and finally to his current position. However, Caojiadu is a place with many factories and a large population, and the area is vast, making it difficult to manage. But Ren handled it with ease. After the January 28th Incident broke out, Ren stayed in the office for a long time, personally supervising his subordinates to maintain the local area, day and night, without the slightest slack. Later, because the 19th Route Army retreated to the Second Defense Line, the Japanese army confiscated all the guns in the Sixth District. In this critical situation, Ren was not afraid of violence and argued with reason. As a result, the Japanese army returned them in full. His courage was such. Now he has suddenly passed away, and everyone who hears about it deeply regrets it. It is said that the vacancy in the Sixth District will be filled by the current Director of the Third District, Zhang Qinming. The position in the Third District will be filled by Yu Baozhen, the assistant of the Second Section.</p>

<p>▲Eight Measures Resolved to Temporarily Cope with the Current Situation ▲Start an Investigation to Fundamentally Eliminate the Problem</p>
<p>In view of the suffering of contract labor workers, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau specially invited various related groups yesterday afternoon at 1 PM to discuss ways to eliminate social evils and protect labor. More than twenty groups attended, including the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, the War Zone Civilian Temporary Relief Association, and the Hudong Commune. More than twenty representatives attended, including Feng Liutang, Zhu Hanzhang, and Zhang Lue. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Luo Yi and Hang Dingan to attend, and Wang Zhiqin recorded the minutes. First, Chairman Luo Yi reported the purpose of the meeting, and then the issue of eliminating contract labor workers was discussed. It was resolved (1) to notify each shelter to report the number of such workers, and not to allow them to be claimed or guaranteed by the contract food providers, pending further arrangements. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau will clarify the relationship between the contract food providers and the workers to resolve disputes, and issue orders to each shelter to handle the matter in accordance with the following two measures: (A) The maintenance groups will issue certificates to the contract food providers for the original family members to inquire about the contract food providers, with evidence to rely on. (B) The maintenance groups will send letters to the family members of the workers. (3) Each shelter will notify the family members of the workers to claim them, and explain the secrets of the contract labor system. If they wish the charitable organizations to maintain or introduce them to work, they can do as they please. (4) Before the family members of the workers claim them, each children's welfare group should share the responsibility of sheltering and educating them. When they reach the legal age of child labor, which is fourteen years old, the maintenance groups should try to introduce them to work in factories. (5) When introducing the workers to work, it must be stipulated with the factory that the wages belong to the workers, or temporarily deposited in the maintenance group and transferred to the workers' family members. (6) When introducing the workers to work, it must be stipulated with the factory that the provisions of Articles 6 and 7 of the Factory Law should be followed, and there should be no discrimination or abuse. (7) The groups that introduce the workers to work should periodically check on the living conditions of the workers after they enter the factory to fulfill their responsibility of guaranteeing them. (8) Investigate the actual situation of the system in order to eliminate it thoroughly.</p>

<p>Since the general affairs, translation, and printing departments of the Commercial Press held a meeting, they have unanimously resolved to oppose layoffs. It is also said that they have submitted a petition to the government to withdraw the order. However, the company suddenly published the social affairs bureau's approval in the newspaper yesterday (the 9th), and scheduled to distribute severance pay and implement the layoff procedures. Upon hearing the news, the association convened an emergency meeting yesterday (the 9th). It is said that the city government's approval was not agreed upon by the labor side. The association will immediately declare its dissent, and will petition the higher authorities to request the maintenance of the labor contract, in order to comply with the spirit of the rule of law. It was originally scheduled for all employees to go to the city government to petition yesterday (the 9th), but because it happened to be the national humiliation memorial day, and both the Chinese and foreign concessions had been put under martial law, it was feared that misunderstandings would arise, so it was decided to go to petition today.

<h3 id="e117">Reasons for Opposing the Installation of Main Water Meters <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Shui Yu Company sent a letter to the Shanghai Real Estate Association yesterday, stating: To Whom It May Concern, the water company suddenly sent workers to our company's Runyu Lane, Yangshupu Road, to install main water meters without obtaining our company's consent beforehand, nor was there any notification. This abruptness is deeply regrettable. We have checked the letter from the company to your association, which stated that in order to save water, there is a desire to install meters. Our company does not oppose this in principle, but in order to prevent waste, it is necessary to install a water meter for each household, as promised in the original letter, and to directly collect water fees from the tenants in order to be effective, in the same proportion as residents' electricity use. The owners should not bear any responsibility, but in order to be considerate of the tenants and avoid the cumbersome procedures of installing and removing water meters, the owners may pay the meter price and deposit on behalf of the tenants. If the water is measured according to the current main meter system of the company, it is equivalent to adding the cost of water wasted by the tenants to the owners, what is the meaning of saving? Our company cannot recognize this and asks your association to negotiate with the company to implement the proposal of installing meters for each household. We would be most grateful.

The chairman was Ms. Wu Qiongyao of the Shanghai West Workers' Group. More than 100 people attended, gathering together to celebrate. At the same time, they were also concerned about national crisis issues, female workers' work issues, and unemployment issues. Therefore, the most important thing in this commemoration meeting was how female workers can fulfill their patriotic duties and how workers can solve their own problems, such as unemployment and work conditions. All participants felt that female workers should bear a great mission in the future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Miscellaneous Grain and Sesame Cake Trade Association yesterday announced to the fellow trades, stating that when the Japanese occupied Shanghai, they saw a large amount of activity in Yangtze River trade, and Shanghai is a distribution area for goods, especially the source of recovery of the Yangtze River. The most important reason for the Japanese army's massacre in Shanghai during this Shanghai incident is this point. We should all uphold the responsibility of every citizen for the rise and fall of the country. At this time when national hatred has not been avenged, we should unanimously reject Japanese goods. This association adheres to this position and will not allow itself to slack off. Therefore, it was resolved at the 26th executive committee meeting yesterday that if any member of the trade privately orders goods from Japanese merchants or ships them on Japanese ships, once discovered, the association will recognize the member as a public enemy and immediately expel them from the association. The entire trade will be notified not to buy or sell, and the same will be done in the case of substitutions. This is hereby posted, hoping that all trades will understand this intention and take note. This is of utmost importance. Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to Public Works Department</p>
<h3 id="e120">Request That the Yan Yutang Kidnapping Case Be Solved Within a Time Limit <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲Patrol Officers Lack Training, Allowing Bandits to Escape ▲It Is Deeply Regrettable That Taxpayers Do Not Enjoy Protection</p>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, based on a letter from the Jiangxi Road Business Association stating that the patrol officers did not do their best in pursuing the bandits when Yan Yutang of the Guangyu Business Company was kidnapped, which seemed to be due to a lack of training, sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department yesterday, requesting that the case be solved within a time limit. The original letter stated: To Whom It May Concern, the Jiangxi Road Business Association reported that Yan Yutang, the general manager of the Guangyu Business Company on this road, was driving his own car to the company entrance at 8:30 AM on the 4th of this month, when four or five bandits suddenly came up to the car with guns. Two bandits pointed their guns at the driver, forbidding him to make a sound, and monitored the driver. The remaining bandits monitored the victim, driving the car straight to the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Avenue Edward VII, forcing the driver out of the car, and sped away. When he was kidnapped, a Chinese constable on Jiangxi Road and Five Horse Road witnessed the situation. Only after the car left did he blow the whistle. Three or four patrol officers arrived later. The kidnapped car happened to drive to the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Jiangxi Road. The red light stopped it for three minutes. The patrol officers only blew the whistle lightly behind it and did not pursue it, allowing it to escape and drive away. The Public Works Department is responsible for the improper maintenance of law and order, and after the incident, it did not fulfill its duties to apprehend the bandits. This is due to poor training. This matter concerns the local security and responsibilities. We should request your association to protest to the Public Works Department as soon as possible, to solve the case within a time limit, in order to maintain commerce and protect security, etc. We have received this request. The police officers must be brave and agile when dealing with bandits. According to the Jiangxi Road Business Association, there was an opportunity to rescue Yan Yutang. However, because the patrol officers of your bureau lacked training and were unable to respond to the situation in a timely manner, lacking both courage and agility, they allowed Yan to be kidnapped by the bandits, failing to provide the protection he was entitled to under his tax obligations. This is deeply regrettable. In accordance with the previous letter, we should request your bureau to investigate the case thoroughly as soon as possible, solve the case within a time limit, and order all police officers to pay close attention to it in the future in order to maintain law and order. Do not fail to do so.</p>

<p>Jin Baoyi, a probationary detective of the French Concession Police Department No. 61, was shot and killed by bandits on the evening of the 6th while resisting arrest, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday was the day of Detective Jin's funeral. The French Chief Inspector, Feiber, along with Western Detective Chief Inspectors from various police stations, and Hua Detective Chief Inspector Tao Defu, led a group of inspectors, deputy inspectors, and detectives to pay their respects at the funeral altar at noon. The funeral procession commenced at 2:00 PM. Police officers and patrolmen from the Public Concession Police Department and the Public Security Bureau were dispatched to participate in the funeral procession. Detectives from the English, French, and Chinese districts also attended to hold the ropes of the hearse. The French Concession Police Department dispatched a platoon of armed Annamese police to escort the procession. The funeral was extremely grand, truly embodying the glory in life and sorrow in death. It is now heard that the Municipal Council plans to grant generous compensation. Furthermore, Qian Achun, the worker who was killed by a stray bullet at the time, was reported to the Second Special Court yesterday to be examined and verified. As he had no family, the French Concession Police Department's Special Squad pooled funds to purchase high-quality clothing and a coffin, providing a dignified funeral and placing him in a temporary hall, awaiting family recognition.

At the time, the post office was crowded with people remitting money, and she could not get to the counter. Lu Jinzhang, a tailor from Yangzhou who lives at No. 7 Ma'an Lane, Chongqing Road, was also there to remit silver dollars home. Seeing that she could not get to the counter, he pretended to be well-intentioned and offered to hand the silver dollars over for her. She believed him to be true and handed the silver dollars over to the counter. Unexpectedly, Lu had malicious intentions and wanted to seize the money. He wrote his own Yangzhong County address on the remittance slip to retrieve the receipt and escape. She discovered his deception, grabbed him, and demanded the receipt. During the argument, a clerk with the surname Lü confirmed that Lu had unlawful intentions and immediately called the police to send the person and evidence to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special District Court. Fei Xizhen, the police station's lawyer, explained the case, stating that the case was clear. If the plaintiff entrusted the defendant to hand over the money, then the defendant committed the crime of embezzlement. If the defendant conspired to hand over the money, it was considered embezzlement and should be handled according to the law. The plaintiff then stated the previous events. A postal worker with the surname Lü also testified in court, proving the defendant's unlawful actions. When questioned, the defendant Lu Jinzhang continued to deny the charges and refused to admit guilt. Presiding Judge Wu Fanglian stated that the case was clear and that no denial would be allowed. He then announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled a date for sentencing. The defendant was returned to custody. The remittance slip with the evidence was sent to the police station to be returned to the postal worker with instructions to correct the address and send it. Hujiamuqiao.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese army occupied Zhabei, traitors such as Hu Lifu and Wang Du have been enticing smokers and gamblers to openly set up gambling dens and opium dens, engaging in various illegal activities. Although the ceasefire agreement has been initialed and signed, the Zhabei area has been handed over to our authorities for takeover. However, the traitors remain unrepentant and continue to openly gamble under the protection of the Japanese in Hujiamuqiao, Hongkou, and are sending out many touts (people who specialize in attracting gamblers) to stand at the entrances of major theaters to attract gamblers.

<h3 id="e131">Acquittal in Murder-for-Money Case <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Lu Qingcai, also known as Lu San, from Jiangbei, was arrested last September by his accomplice Chen Sanwenzijing of the Chief Patrol Room, who confessed to participating in kidnapping activities. Chinese and Western detectives then brought Chen, the thief, to the French Concession to arrest Lu. During the investigation, Lu suddenly fell ill and was returned to the hospital by the police station. He died in the hospital within a few days. After examination by the court, his wife, Lu Yinshi, was ordered to collect the body. Unexpectedly, she hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Local Court, accusing Zhou Honglin, the detective in charge of the case at the Chief Inspection Office, of demanding a bribe of 2,000 yuan from her husband, Lu Qingcai. When the time came for repayment, not only did he not return the money, but he also falsely accused her husband of being a kidnapper, and arrested him and abused him with torture, causing Lu's death. She requested that he be convicted of murder for money and that the loan be recovered. The case has been repeatedly opened and investigated. The previous newspaper reported repeatedly about this case. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. The defense lawyer of the defendant Zhou Honglin, Fan Gang, and others were present in court to await instructions. Judge Qian then ascended the stand and declared Zhou Honglin not guilty. The accompanying civil lawsuit was dismissed. Ding Xingzi</p>
<h3 id="e132">Trial of Drunk Man Who Killed His Wife Begins <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲Peacemaker Killed ▲Wait for Family to Arrive Before Questioning Ding Xingzi, a man from Yangzhou, came to Shanghai from Hankou earlier. He learned that his wife, Mao Guiying, from Hubei Province, had developed a relationship with a certain adjutant surnamed Chen and was unwilling to follow him as a wife. In a moment of anger, at noon on the 3rd of this month, he took a knife while drunk to No. 195 Dongyouheng Road, in the pavilion room upstairs of his home, and stabbed Guiying in the forehead and other parts of her body. Her mother, Mao Gao, and aunt, Gao Xushi, intervened to mediate, but were also stabbed to the ground by Ding. They were all sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. As a result, Gao Xushi died of her injuries. The Hongkou police station heard the alarm and dispatched Chinese detective Liu Zhaonian to take Ding Xingzi, along with two murder weapons, to the First Special District Court. The details of the interrogation and the examination of Gao Xushi have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over a continued interrogation at the First Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that the victims, Mao Guiying and Mao Gao, had slightly recovered from their injuries and were in court to testify. When questioned, Mao Guiying testified that she was 19 years old and the defendant was her husband. Last October, her aunt, Gao Xushi (the deceased), acted as matchmaker and she married Ding in Shanghai at the Yuegong Hotel on Sichuan Road. However, she previously had a husband with a certain surname and had long been divorced. During the previous Shanghai war, she and her mother and sister took refuge in the Guangtailai Inn on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. At that time, the defendant was still at home taking care of the house. Because his mother and former wife both ran brothels in Hankou, and his wife was also a prostitute, her mother (Mao Gao) had instructed him to go to Hankou and bring his mother and wife to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, he returned to Shanghai the other day, only bringing his son, Xiao Mao (4 years old), and three prostitutes, Lao San and Azhu. At the Guangtailai Inn, she was questioned by her mother, and her aunt, Gao Xushi (the deceased), also scolded him for being willing to live as a cuckold and not bringing his mother and wife to Shanghai. She then planned to temporarily live in a church for a month, and the defendant harbored resentment. The next day, they returned to their home at No. 195 Dongyouheng Road for lunch. He drank a cup of Shaoxing wine. After a while, after the meal was over, he secretly locked the door and produced two sharp knives, one from her home and one he had hidden beforehand, and stabbed her in the forehead, then stabbed her in the hand. At that time, her mother (Mao Gao) quickly pulled him away, and her aunt, Gao Xushi, also stepped forward to persuade him, but they were all stabbed and fell to the ground. The defendant accused her of having an affair with a certain adjutant, which was not true. Her mother, Mao Gao, stated that Guiying was her biological daughter. Last autumn, her daughter went to visit her aunt, Gao Xushi. He saw her and immediately asked her to act as matchmaker and married her at the Yuegong Hotel in Shanghai. Later, they went to Hankou and learned that he had a wife who was a prostitute, so they quarreled and returned to Shanghai. They rented a house on the same road. Earlier, because she had instructed him to go to Hankou and feared that his mother and wife would come to Shanghai, he only brought his son and two young prostitutes. She slightly condemned him, and he developed this vicious intention, leading to this tragedy. She was stabbed in the waist and hand in two places. The family of the deceased (Gao Xushi) will come to Shanghai in a few days. When questioned, the defendant stated that because his wife wanted to go to the church, he was momentarily upset, and because he was drunk, he intended to intimidate his wife Guiying with a knife and did not intend to kill her. The injuries to Mao Gao and the deceased Gao Xushi were due to drunkenness and confusion, and he stabbed them involuntarily. He asked for leniency. Judge Shen ordered him to remain in custody and wait for the family of the deceased to arrive before questioning. Mao Guiying and Mao Gao were taken by the court clerk to the forensic room to examine the injuries.</p>

<p>▲Sentenced to One Year and Six Months of Imprisonment Zhuo Qingen, a 26-year-old Cantonese, was an employee in the current account department of the Hong Kong National Savings Bank on Jiangxi Road. On April 22nd, he used fraudulent means to forge a check and impersonate the seal of depositor Hong Li to withdraw 2,000 taels of silver from the Women's Commercial Savings Bank on Nanjing Road and deposit it privately into the Shanghai Bank. The National Bank discovered the incident and reported it to the Chief Patrol Room the day before yesterday. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to arrest Zhuo and seize 400 silver dollars and a deposit slip from the Shanghai Bank with a balance of 100 yuan. He was taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated the case and said that the money deposited in the Shanghai Bank by the defendant had been gradually withdrawn. In addition to the 400 yuan seized from the defendant, only 100 yuan remained on the deposit slip. Zheng Jiaju, an employee in the accounting department of the National Bank, also filed a case, explaining everything. When questioned, the defendant said that he did not know who put the check in his drawer, and the seal had already been affixed. It was true that he sent his brother-in-law Liang Zhenpeng to collect it. After verifying the confession, Judge Qian Hongye sentenced the defendant Zhuo Qingen to one year and six months of imprisonment for using forged valuable vouchers to fraudulently obtain property, and imposed a fine of 500 yuan. If the fine is not paid in full, it will be converted into imprisonment at a rate of two yuan per day. The forged check will be confiscated. In the accompanying civil lawsuit, the defendant should compensate the plaintiff with 2,000 taels of silver and statutory interest from April 22nd of this year until the date of the end of the execution. The 400 silver dollars and the remaining balance of 100 yuan deposited in the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank Yaoji account are allowed to be seized.</p>

<p>▲Pedestrian Ju Sanyou Injured At around 9:00 AM yesterday, a French tram traveling from Min'guo Road to the intersection of Tongqing Street was struck head-on by a collapsing cart pulled by Huang Wenxi. The tram was damaged in two places, and a pedestrian, Ju Yiyou, was injured in the leg. Qian Tingyong, an inspector from the French Tram Company, and Ju Sanyou, who was injured in the leg, took Huang Wenxi and the collapsing cart to Zhu Tinghui, a police officer from the 15th Watch Post of the 1st Section of the 2nd District. After questioning by Chief Xu, the plaintiff and defendant were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

When the car passed the corner of Mao'hai Road, it sped out of control and drove onto the cement sidewalk, instantly injuring Ma Xiaoguang, a resident of Anhui at No. 3261 Yinhua Lane, Robert'son Road, in the head. He was bleeding profusely and his injuries were serious. A rickshaw puller was also injured in a vital area and died instantly. Officer No. 1851 arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm and arrested the driver for punishment. The injured person was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment, and the body was taken to the Felun Road Mortuary for examination, pending notification to the court for inspection.</p>

<p>Dr. Cen Zhongming, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner at No. 504 Dexing Lane, Haining Road, has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for more than ten years. All those who suffer from illness and receive his treatment are revived, and he has saved countless lives every year.

Dr. Cen felt compassion for them and provided free consultations at the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII and at the Tianji Hall on Wuma Road, not taking any fees. Therefore, many refugees suffering from illness received his treatment. Now that the situation has calmed down, Cen has returned to his residence to practice medicine as usual, but he continues to provide free consultations to the poor and sick.</p>

<p>Hanli Company, a Chinese merchant (No. 467 Jiangxi Road, opposite the water tower, telephone 19049), sells various lampblack manufactured by famous American factories, which is very suitable for making ink and rubber overshoes. In the past, this imported product was sold by foreign merchants, and Chinese people only knew to buy it from foreign firms to meet their needs. Now that Chinese people are directly transporting and selling it, why not purchase it directly from Hanli Company in order to regain profit rights? All industries involved in the manufacture of rubber, ink, natural ink, and ink sticks should pay attention.</p>

<p>▲Tried Yesterday by the Second Special Court Ying Xiyuan, from Hangzhou, the owner of the Dashun Transportation Company behind the South Railway Station, was previously investigated and seized by detectives from the 2nd District Public Security Bureau for smuggling the poisonous substance red pills. Ying and the stolen goods were taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, Yu Xin'gong Customs Brokerage, located at No. 5 Jilifang, Diandang Street, French Concession, entrusted him to transport them. The bureau requested the French Concession Police to send detectives to Yu Xin'gong to arrest the owner, Li Yushan, who was not present. Only Zhang Pekui, a partner, and Li Zhushi, the wife of the owner, were found. Ten items were seized and taken to the police station to be sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the case, requesting the transfer. The official stated that the crime occurred in the French Concession and ordered the Public Security Bureau to send Ying and the stolen goods to the court for interrogation and verification. Zhang and Zhu were released on bail pending verification. The Public Security Bureau then sent Ying, along with the evidence, twenty small packages of red pills, two wooden boxes of medicinal powder, and two packages of white medicinal powder, to the Second Special Court for investigation. Yesterday, Zhang Pekui and Li Zhushi were summoned. Ying was sent to the court. In the afternoon, Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the trial in Criminal Division 1. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case. Ying Xiyuan confessed that on April 2nd, he went to Yu Xin'gong Customs Brokerage. The accountant told him that there would be two packages of stone powder to be transported to Hangzhou the next day. The next day, someone was sent to drive the truck to the company, and it was seized by the Public Security Bureau. He did not know it was red pills at the time, and there was a Yu Xin'gong note to prove it. He also hired a lawyer to defend him and requested permission to post bail. When questioned, Zhang Pekui confessed that although he wrote the note, the goods were directly entrusted to Ying for transfer by the customer Zhang Jinfu. Li Zhushi confessed that her husband, Li Yushan, had returned to his native Jiangxi, and she did not know anything about the affairs of the business. The court ordered that the trial be continued on May 16th. Ying Xiyuan was ordered to post a shop guarantee of 3,000 yuan. Zhang Pekui's guarantee was changed to 5,000 yuan. If no guarantee was provided, they would be detained. Li Zhushi was released on her original bail pending verification.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Correspondence <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, we, Yang Cai Hua Xian and Yang Hua Xun Yang, hereby declare that upon reading the article (Yang Shengzhi's concubine is in litigation for inheritance, and Lawyer Zhang Shizhao submitted a written opinion) published on the third page, tenth edition of Shen Bao on the 23rd of this month, it is entirely inconsistent with the facts and damages our reputation. The lawsuit filed by the late husband's concubine, Wang Jiazhen, this time was for alimony, not for inheritance. This is error one. Hua Xian and Xun Yang were both officially married by the late husband, with matchmakers, marriage certificates, and locations where the wedding ceremonies were held, all with solid evidence. Although the late husband's elder brother, Shengzhao, died in Fushun for national affairs, and he intended to marry two wives to have a son to inherit the family line, it seemed to constitute bigamy, but we were unaware of this beforehand. After negotiation, the late husband remained adamant. Now that he has passed away, how can our status be compared with Wang Jiazhen, who was redeemed from a brothel? The newspaper stated that there were three concubines, namely Cai Hua Xian and Hua Xun Yang, etc. This is error two. Hua Xian's son, Xiu Qian, is already eleven years old, and the newspaper claimed he was an eight-year-old child. This is error three. Wang Jiazhen stole clothes and valuables and fled, cohabiting with a man named Zhao in the Southeast Hotel in Nanjing. After investigation, it was reported to the police station, and both the person and the stolen goods were seized and sent to the Jiangning District Court for handling. It was not that we refused and falsely accused her. The newspaper had words such as "working together to drive out Jiazhen, accusing her of adultery," which is error four. As for our son Xiu Qian, he has been ruled by the Jiangning Court as the heir to the late husband's estate. Wang Jiazhen, due to adultery, has lost her status as a family member and has no right to claim alimony, according to the Supreme Court's interpretation and the precedent of the Dali Court. The opinion letter submitted by Lawyer Zhang Shizhao in this case is divided into four points, leaving people in a fog. Lawyer Zhang is simultaneously acting as the agent for the plaintiff, Wang Jiazhen, requesting 42,000 yuan in alimony, advocating starting from protecting the estate, detaining the proposed 120,000 yuan, and hoping that gentry in Guizhou who have connections would come forward to manage it. Since we have a biological son, the estate belongs to the son and is inherited according to law, which has already been ruled by the court. It is not a comparable situation with an ownerless estate, so what is there to protect and manage? Furthermore, demanding a huge amount of alimony from the late husband's biological son and virtuous wife by a runaway adulteress, and attempting to damage the estate by recklessly requesting detention, there is no legal precedent to allow it. We previously hired your esteemed lawyer as a year-round legal counsel, responsible for safeguarding reputation and other legal rights, which has been advertised in newspapers such as Shen Xin Times. Now that the report damages our reputation, we should request a representative to send a letter to the editor of Shen Bao, requesting that this letter be published in the newspaper's correspondence column or other equivalent position, in place of a correction, to avoid confusion. This would be greatly appreciated. After verifying the mentioned points, they are all consistent with the case file evidence and legal precedents. We hereby request your newspaper to verify and publish this, correct the factual errors, and protect the reputation of the parties involved. This is greatly appreciated. Respectfully addressed to the editor of Shen Bao, Lawyer Shan Yuhua, April 29th. I hereby state that yesterday, on May 5th, I read in your newspaper that Yang Xianbang came to our hospital for treatment, and that Tao Shuzhen was taking care of him, etc. Reading this was very surprising because our hospital is a maternity and child care hospital. How could Yang Xianbang come to our hospital for treatment? Since the opening of our hospital, there has also been no one named Tao Shuzhen. How could this have happened? Because it is related to the reputation of our hospital, please make a correction on our behalf. This is respectfully addressed to the editor, Bethel Hospital, respectfully. Educational News.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Exhaustion of Jiangsu Provincial Education Funds <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>▲ Schools will distribute income on a pro rata discounted basis upon opening. ▲ Grades 1, 2, and 3 may not be paid according to the budget. | Only 2,612,000 yuan collected this year | | Education Funds Management Office returns to Funds Committee | The Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office sent a letter to the Jiangsu Education Funds Committee, stating: In response to your committee's letter No. 31, approving the six proposals sent by principals of Jiangsu Provincial Secondary Schools, such as Wang Maozu, to be submitted for discussion at the 29th meeting, its sixth proposal requests that the Management Office be responsible for handling the disbursement of funds for this year in accordance with the following three items: (1) The disbursement of January funds should be completed by the end of April at the latest; (2) The notification of the allocation of February funds to counties should be issued by the end of April at the latest; (3) The disbursement of March funds should be completed by June 20th at the latest. This was resolved at the 29th meeting of this committee to be communicated to the Management Office for disbursement as requested. Accordingly, an excerpt of the proposal is sent for your information and disbursement, etc. Upon approval, it was found that last year's floods caused severe damage. Director Chen Mengzhao of the Finance Department, knowing that the special education funds for the 20th year would be greatly affected, also inquired and accurately estimated the collectible amount. It was roughly estimated that the salt, teeth, and land taxes would amount to 2.35 million yuan, which was communicated to your committee for verification, and relief was requested. At that time, it was only the flood. The foreign invasion had not yet spread to Jiangsu Province. By this year, the Japanese military had provoked incidents, occupied Shanghai and Zhejiang, and wars continued. Director Zhou Fohai knew that tax collection would be even more difficult. On February 15th, your committee convened the 28th meeting and proposed to formulate measures for the reduction of expenses for provincial educational institutions during the national crisis, in order to economize and maintain the situation. It was jointly resolved that the expenses of provincial educational institutions from December of the 20th year must be maintained according to the budget. The Management Office should do its best to raise funds. If there is a shortfall, the primary school funds, boarding fees for normal school students, and overseas study funds should be disbursed according to the original amount on a monthly basis. In addition, schools in the war zone that cannot open should be given maintenance fees at their discretion, and the rest should be distributed on a pro rata discounted basis. When the situation stabilizes, income increases, and disbursement can be made according to the original amount, the discounted amount should be stopped and the previously discounted amount should be compensated, etc. This is also a temporary measure to maintain the situation by adjusting expenditures to income. This office is preparing to allocate funds accordingly. Now that the previous reason is approved, the budget is still required to be disbursed according to the budget during the national crisis, which seems to conflict with the 28th resolution. According to the various incomes of this year, as of now, there are more than 2,158,000 yuan, plus more than 454,000 yuan of funds allocated to counties, totaling more than 2,612,000 yuan. (The financial department's subsidy has not been received.) Based on the estimated amount, it has already been exceeded, and resources have been exhausted. Now, there is a deadline for disbursing the funds for the first three months of the year to various schools, totaling more than 936,000 yuan, which is difficult to raise in a prosperous year and a peaceful time. At this time of famine and war, Jiangbei is affected by floods, and Jiangnan is also affected by military affairs. Tax revenue is insufficient, and there is little money to be transferred. Even the funds allocated by various counties have not been paid in full. Where can a large amount of income come from? In addition, financial stagnation and banks' refusal to lend make it impossible to accommodate. Resources are exhausted, and there is nothing to pay. This is due to natural disasters and man-made disasters, and there is nothing that can be done. However, schools are in difficulty and should do their best to maintain this. It is already impossible to find a way. What about the funds for the fourth, fifth, and sixth months? Accordingly, we request your committee to deliberate and provide guidance so that we can follow it. We are extremely anxious to await your instructions.

<h3 id="e152">Shanghai's Educational Undertakings After January 28th (1) Shang <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>▲ Schools closed due to the outbreak of war. ▲ Staff and students died in accidents. The left-wing writer Sinclair in New Continent published the following passage at the beginning of his book criticizing American education ("The Goose-Step"): "Today, millions of young people are studying in schools. They are the lifeline of our nation and the cornerstone of our country's future. If they receive a sound education, the country will be peaceful and great. Otherwise, there is little hope for everything." Indeed, education is the most fundamental undertaking for saving and building the country, which no one can deny. The country's poverty is not true poverty, but the lack of knowledge of young children is true poverty. The Japanese's strong armor and cannons sank Wusong Zhabei. Shanghai will never go bankrupt, but the destruction of cultural institutions in Wusong Zhabei means Shanghai will truly go bankrupt. The Japanese army seems to have clearly seen this. After the outbreak of the January 28th Shanghai Incident, wherever the enemy's footprints reached, schools, libraries, and bookstores were all ravaged. This loss cannot be redeemed by anything. Let us wipe away our tears, endure the pain, and calculate the account for Shanghai's education sector after January 28th.</p>
<h3 id="e153">1. Population Casualties <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The school calendar for the 20th year stipulates that February 1st is the beginning of the second semester. As the day approached for schools at all levels to start classes, the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred. Some schools, enthusiastic about education and serious about running schools, planned to make up for the students' missed studies in the previous semester due to the fall of the Northeast by starting school early. Therefore, most of the school's faculty and staff went to school, and students entered school together. They were preparing to spend a peaceful teaching and studying life of ringing bells for class and shaking bells after class. Unexpectedly, the enemy's guns and cannons and bombs awakened their good dreams, and they could not even attend the (last lesson). Even if they had heard the news beforehand that the situation was tight, the intelligent intellectual class would naturally join the masses and move away like ants. However, after all, many people learned from the government's (calm) attitude and did nothing. As a result, the male and female teachers and students of Guangdong primary and secondary schools were displaced, and the whereabouts of the principal of Chongde Girls' Middle School had to be inquired about by the administrative organs. Li Shicen of the Commercial Press escaped danger by claiming illness, and Shen Baiying carried the burden of young refugees and fled. 1,473 pieces of luggage from Shanghai Law School disappeared. Everyone was concerned about their own lives, who would care about the education undertaking that is the foundation of the country? Cautious people, learning from the ancient saying "evacuate to the city in minor unrest and evacuate to the countryside in major unrest," abandoned Shanghai, which was usually the focus of attention, and sang the song of returning home and retreating to the inland. However, what about the staff and students who returned to their hometown but could not see their parents? They can only wander like stateless White Russians, or be slaughtered like chickens, ducks, pigs, and sheep. The reporter paid attention to the reports in the newspapers or the reports of friends, and investigated the casualties of the population of schools at all levels in 137 schools in the war zone. The circumstances are described as follows: Student Zhou of Soochow University, Yao Jingfei of Chih Tze University, Zhao Bishi, director of academic affairs of Soochow Second Middle School, Li Boyi, director of the dormitory of Guangzhao Primary School, and his two sons, Jiang Da, a school worker at Southeast Medical College, Yang Ada, a school worker at Chih Tze Affiliated Middle School, Wang, a maidservant, Pan Aq, a gatekeeper at Guangdong Primary School, Tao Ada, a school worker, and others all died in accidents. Four students from Great China University (it is said that two students have been released by the Japanese command), Tan Bian, a technician at the Jiaotong University factory (living in Dade Lane, North Sichuan Road), Yang Xianwen, Yang Boren, Chen Dehua, students of Jinan University, Wang Yongzhen, a student of Nanyang High School of Commerce, Zhang Qihou, a teacher at Sanyu Primary School, Jiang Shixu, a teacher at Qingbai Primary School, and his family of six, Jiang Shengzhi, a teacher, Zhang Gensong and Zhang Yagen of the German Poultry School, Fang Xuejian, an employee of the White Goose Painting Tutoring School, etc., are still missing. Chen Huadong, a student at the Land Hospital of Zhongda Medical College, Chen Shidao, an employee of the Art College, Feng Hepu, Feng Kanglan, and Miss Ma, a Western teacher at Chongde Girls' Middle School, Wu Jingshan, an employee of Nanyang High School of Commerce, etc., were injured. There are also many school workers who were injured or missing. What kind of reaction do readers have to this ominous news besides sighing and complaining?</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market has seen significant progress, showing a vibrant atmosphere. Genuine needs among customers have greatly increased. The enthusiasm of buyers from all sides marks the first surge since the Shanghai Incident. This is mainly due to the signing of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, the withdrawal of Japanese troops, and the gradual restoration of transportation. In terms of financial resources, the financial sector has been able to adjust and assist, unlike the sluggishness of previous days. As a result, people's spirits have been lifted. Additionally, the price of 20-count "Ren Zhong" yarn is 23 taels lower than the peak in February. Given the slightly improved environment, various customers have been actively procuring, leading to a sudden and prosperous turnaround in the long-depressed yarn sales. However, Japanese factories have fully resumed operations, making great efforts in production. Regarding sales, they are proceeding vigorously. Therefore, the best Chinese yarn does not need to be discounted, but should follow the trend and clear out the bottom stock. Future prospects will still depend on the current situation. It is observed that the Guangdong customers have made the most purchases. Due to the suspension of bidding for "Biao" yarn on the 59th, the reopening of bidding tomorrow is expected to bring a rise of one or two taels, as the current increase in genuine demand may excite people's spirits. Total daily purchases of spot yarn by various customers are estimated at 2,500 bales. Market prices have risen by 2.5 to 5 qian. Guangdong customers purchased 1,500 bales, domestic customers purchased 200 bales, Northern customers purchased 50 bales, Jiangxi customers purchased 170 bales, Shantou customers purchased 250 bales, Changsha customers purchased 50 bales, Hankou customers purchased 35 bales, and fellow traders purchased 100 bales.

<p>▲ Mostly Saturated with Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but factory demand remains sluggish. As most manufacturers are saturated with foreign cotton, there is currently no need for large-scale purchases. However, small purchases for blending purposes continue. With the recent improvement in yarn sales, there may be some active buying prospects. Therefore, the current situation is more active. According to statistics from the exchange, 110,800 dan of "Biao" cotton were traded last week. The opening prices of various factories are listed below: Shaanxi cotton 31.25, Dafeng Factory purchased 220 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory.

<p>▲ Bombay: Last week's market price fell slightly with American cotton. The lowest point was reached on Wednesday. Japanese exporters made slight offsets at this low price.

In terms of futures, business was poor, and the labor unrest in Lancashire was tense. Mainly due to the smooth progress of new American cotton, it led to a trend of mass selling. The announcement of the US Department of Agriculture's policy of selling stockpiled cotton, although sufficient to dispel doubts, was still difficult to satisfy people, as the inventory at the end of the season will be greater than the consumption of the season. The weekend followed the rise of American cotton. Egyptian cotton business was poor. Silk and Tea</p>

<p>▲ Terrible Weather... No Hope for Silk Harvest</p>
<p>In recent years, the silk industry in Zhuji, Zhejiang, has been developing rapidly. Last year, due to damage from the weather, the silk harvest was greatly reduced. This year, farmers fear repeating the same mistake as last spring. Furthermore, the rural economy is strained. The number of silkworm eggs raised is only about 40% of last year's. After the silkworms hatched, there were continuous cloudy and rainy days, and the climate temperature was not high, which was unfavorable for development. Until the middle of the third molt, the leaves were abundant. After a stuffy and hot day and night, 30-40% of the silkworms were lost. The early silkworms have already entered the major molt. Unexpectedly, the weather suddenly turned strangely cold again, and it was cloudy and rainy with no sunshine. The silkworms all suffered from insomnia and stopped eating. This year's silk harvest will be hopeless again.</p>
<h3 id="e163">The Price of Sichuan Yellow Silk Also Fell Miserably <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The local foreign firm silk market in this city has been affected by the low-price competition of Japanese silk in the European and American markets. Yellow and white factory silk has been almost lifeless. Yesterday morning, there were no silk telegrams from overseas transferring to Shanghai. Although British and Indian firms had Sichuan yellow silk to replenish shortages, the price also fell miserably. It is estimated that Jardine Matheson and others imported top-grade 13-15-filament Sichuan yellow factory silk of the 25th color for 580 to 605 taels. Samsung and others imported 30 bales of No. 2 "Hongri Lanfeng" brand crude crude silk from Chongmian for 280 to 300 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local tea factories' "Zhenmei" green tea, totaling more than 130 boxes, was put on the market. British firms such as Hehe, Jardine Matheson, and Jinlong were very interested in buying in order to catch the new shipment of the Dalai Company's ship "Bombay" which was about to sail. It is heard that more than 40 boxes of Yu'an firm's goods have been negotiated and priced at 130 taels. More than 80 boxes of Shaoxing firm's goods have been negotiated and priced at 125 taels. In the autumn when the new tea from this route of firms has not yet arrived, the market is still considered brisk. However, local firms are quite anxious due to the lack of tea-making labor.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Britain and Canada Impose Import Taxes on Chinese Tea <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The British government previously proposed to increase the import tax on Chinese tea by 50%. According to news from London yesterday, this proposal has been implemented since the 1st of this month. The method is to add 4 pence for each pound of tea. According to the current shilling calculation, it is equivalent to 25 taels of Chinese silver per dan. Combining with the previous tax rate, each dan needs to be taxed 50 taels of Chinese silver. However, the British government has not discussed adding taxes on the import of red tea from Indian territories. According to general tea industry experts, the purpose of the British government's heavy taxation of Chinese tea is to curb the development of Chinese tea trade with Britain and to promote the prosperity of territorial tea industry.</p>

<p>Yesterday (30th), the various routes of Qimen and Fuliang autumn red tea, due to the sunny and warm weather, mountain households took advantage of the situation to dry the tea leaves and rushed to pick, rub, and make tea, and the shipments were very abundant. The main branch firms all opened scales together today to compete for procurement. The market price opened in the Baimao Port area of Fuliang at 90 yuan per dan, and the price in the Hantan area was 70 yuan, which was 7-8 yuan higher than the old price. The price in the Xianglin Bay and Yingxi areas of Qiu opened at 70-90 yuan, which was also 10 yuan higher than last year. The price in the southwest of Qimen still opened at around 100 yuan, which was no increase or decrease from the previous market price. If the weather is sunny and without rain for several days, the new tea can be collected together. Currently, each firm is trapped by insufficient cash and cannot buy as much as possible, which is a great regret.</p>

<p>The development of Suian green tea in Zhejiang is earlier than that of Anhui. This year, tea firms in the area, in order to seek tender tea leaves and increase the production of fine goods, have advised mountain households to rush to open the gardens before the Beginning of Summer. Therefore, mountain households, due to the strong demand from the tea firms and in order to make profit off high prices, plan to give priority to picking and making tea leaves from Zhouyuan in the next few days to meet the demand.</p>

<p>In previous years, the new tea from various villages in Wuyuan County usually opened gardens before the Beginning of Summer. This year, due to the cold weather after Qingming, the development of tea buds was slow, and mountain tea only showed silver tips. In the past two days, the weather suddenly turned warm, and the rain stopped, and the tea trees quickly became green and lush. As the Beginning of Summer is approaching, the mountain households are deeply concerned that they will not be able to pick and make the tea in time, and those households with a lack of labor, and early tea in the northeast, have already begun to pick and hurry to pick on the 2nd (today), while the remaining mountain households in various villages are currently busy preparing firewood, rice, and miscellaneous items in preparation for entering the market within the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Xiushui Red Tea Market Momentum is Sluggish <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Xiushui, Wuning, and Tonggu counties in Jiangxi have long been important producing areas of red tea. In recent years, due to soil deterioration and the lack of management by mountain households, the quality and taste have deteriorated. The sales of red tea from the counties of Xiushui and Wuning in Shanghai foreign firms have become increasingly narrow. Last year, 50-60 firms in the Xiushui and Wuning counties relied on Shanghai warehouses to enter the mountains to remit money and barely opened the market. The tea produced in boxes totaled around 20,000 boxes. This year, the red flames in the Xiushui and Tonggu counties are still high. Foreign tea firms are all afraid and dare not open the market. None of the Shanghai tea warehouses enter the mountains to welcome guests. The economy of local firms is even more difficult as a result. Except for tea firms with more abundant capital from enemy families, who have already planned to leave the village and open the scales, the rest are watching and not moving forward. The market momentum is extremely sluggish.</p>

<p>Recently, the new tea in Dexing County has grown quite long and can be picked and made on schedule. However, the 7th, 8th, and 9th villages in each village, which are the most abundant in tea production, have recently had 6-7,000 red bandits from Fang Shao retreating to the area from the border of Zhejiang. Residents in Xiaoche Bajun, Xinjian, and Haikou have all fled outside and dare not return home. No one is paying attention to the tea leaves. None of the original tea firms have opened the market. It is observed that the tea market in Dexing County will be difficult to open under this terrifying situation this year. Grain</p>
<h3 id="e171">Rice Market Arrivals and Sales are Two-Faced <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, the arrivals of various firms in southern Shanghai were still numerous, but the sales market was not brisk. Northern firms had settled on early and late rice in the morning. By the afternoon, the visiting firms moved to process them, and the prices rose by nearly a corner. There were few high-quality Yanglu pointed rice, and the middle-grade goods were squeezed by the visiting tips, which seemed to be slow-moving, resulting in price cuts. The arrivals and sales of Bianyin Yuan were evenly matched, and the market was neither rising nor falling. The total amount of rice in the Huangpu River was around 3,000 stones throughout the day. ▲ Yesterday, the source of Nian San Sihao coming down the Suzhou River in northern Shanghai was fixed at the top-grade Su Changbai glutinous rice, and the Zhongguan stale secondary goods fell by one or two corners. Although there was a shortage of Qingjiao Chonggu thin rice and Songjiang rice coming to the market, the appetite was limited, and the situation continued to be weak. The Yanglu pointed rice was also being repaired, and the Fuzhi pointed rice was short of goods and had no market. The sales of Tongbian Yin Yuan were neither glorious nor disgraceful. The customer firms and local streets had some dealings with Yang rice, and the trend continued to be stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Yang rice market situation returned to prosperity. Due to the competition between Changjiang North and the hinterland the previous day, the market price had already increased secretly by 2 corners. After the market opened yesterday, the demand from the hinterland's customer firms became more active, and the local streets also took the opportunity to buy, and the market price increased by another 2 corners or so. The prices rose by as much as 4 corners in two days, and the total transactions were about 40,000 bags, and the market showed a great improvement. Due to the foreign firms not selling and the fixed customers hoarding, the price of spot goods also rose by more than one coin with the rise in spot prices. However, in the afternoon yesterday, due to the increase in water freight by Hankou customer firms, the bidding price increased, and they watched and did not move again. Therefore, the market situation returned to stability after the rise. The selling prices were: No. 1 Saigon 11 yuan 8 corners, Xiao Jiao 10 yuan 7 corners, Mindang 10 yuan 7 corners, Jia Ladi brown rice 9 yuan 9 and a half corners, Xiao Jiao Luzhou goods 9 yuan 9 corners, Xiao Jiao April 4 taels 9 and a half coins, May 5 taels 1 coin and a half.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market's foreign wheat had some slight ups and downs, but the Beiyang customers suddenly started to buy and pack, and people's hearts returned to upward trends. The asking price for standard military ships for this month was 2 taels 0 fen 2.75, and the old car brand was 2 taels 0 fen 2.5. After the intervention of the intermediaries and the follow-up of the hoarders, the military ships closed at 2 taels 0 fen 4, and the old car brand closed at 2 taels 0 fen 3.75. Therefore, it was 1 fen better than the selling price at the end of last weekend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's exchange market allocation and trading was still active, but the number of households selling was particularly low, and the situation was all stable. The trading price of No. 24 coarse sugar of Dutch sugar was 13 taels 2 qian, and the high-quality coarse-grained sugar was 13 taels 2 qian 7.5 fen, and the Hong Kong goods were 13 taels 1 qian, and the market situation was still brisk. The No. 8 Dutch red sugar was 9 taels 5 and a half coins, and the No. 10 was 9 taels 8 qian, and the market was relatively flat. The Taikoo sugar B mark was 16 taels 5 qian, the CW mark was 15 taels 9 qian to 16 taels, the HM mark was 13 taels 8 and a half coins, and the post-market price was 14 taels, and the H mark was 12 taels 2 qian, and the market situation was brisk.

<p>The price of Longkou vermicelli, which was previously stored, had fallen to 19 taels. Now, the newly produced B products have arrived in batches, and the market situation has suddenly become tight. The initial price offered by customers was 19 and a half taels, and the later price showed signs of tightening again. Sales from all parties have also been slightly active, but the selling price has not been able to be too high for a while, and it will be necessary to wait for the opening price to rise again before it can be increased accordingly. Piece Goods</p>
<h3 id="e176">Printed Cloth Falls Sharply <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>In recent times, the piece goods have still been falling more than rising. In particular, the printed cloth item has been declining rapidly. The sales of outgoing goods have been slightly active, which is really due to the crowding of shipments. Yesterday, a set of Shanghai goods colors had fallen to 4 taels 4 qian, two sets of colors 4 taels 4 qian and a half, three sets of colors 4 taels 5 qian, Lun Chang goods white ground 4 taels 3 qian 7.5 fen, colored 4 taels 4 qian and a half, which was about 1 qian less than the previous week. The white ground and black ground satins are also not active, and among the cotton cloths, the fine material spinning is the most sluggish, and the fine cloth fabric is quite active. Yesterday, more than 200 pieces were transacted, but the price was also difficult to excite. "Ren Qiang Lan Ji" (人槍藍鷄) 7 taels 3 qian and a half, "Ren Qiang Hong Ji" (人槍紅鷄) 7 taels 3 qian and 7.5 fen, "Qiqiu" (汽球) 7 taels 0 fen 5, "Lan Shen Ying" (藍神英) 7 taels "Zun" (囤) qian, and "Lan Kong Que" (藍孔雀) 7 taels 3 qian all had transactions. Among the coarse cloths, 9-pound and 11-pound were " " ( ), and 16-pound and 13-pound were still falling. The coarse twill still only has sporadic sales, and East Asian goods have been increasingly active recently. 80-90% of the small wholesale shops in the market have sales, and the "Yuanyu Chou" (元羽綢) is particularly smooth. Most of them are purchased by umbrella factories, because Western goods of "Yuanyu Chou" are quite expensive, and the local factory goods are also in short supply. The asking prices for fine Serge, Zhigong Ni, Satin, and other items are higher than before due to continued sales.</p>

<p>— Ou Xin</p>
<p>I have been doing business in Japan for many years. Since the September 18th Incident last year, overseas Chinese have been increasingly discriminated against. Two months ago, my store's associate, Mr. Liu, was killed, and the store was also destroyed. I had no choice but to close down and return to my country. Before leaving Japan, I traveled to various parts of Tokyo to observe and learn. I saw and heard a lot. I will select a few to tell the people of our country. Recently, Tokyo has been filled with the clouds of war. The Japanese military department claims that the war between Japan and the United States is not far away. It has ordered all troops to be armed and prepared, and is engaged in the construction of defense projects. The Navy has secretly deployed torpedoes in key fortresses. Anti-aircraft equipment has also been prepared. It is now actively building underground railways and military factories. The Japanese government is also planning to move the capital to Korea. A portion has already been secretly moved. The plan is that if it is to fight the United States alone, it will strike first, take the Philippines directly, and eliminate the US Far East Fleet. Then it will attack San Francisco. If Britain and the United States join forces, it will take a defensive position, with the Navy fully defending Tokyo, abandoning Taiwan. If it wins, it will capture Singapore and the Philippines. If it loses, it will withdraw from the mainland and defend Korea and the northeastern part of China. The Japanese suffered heavy losses in this Shanghai War. The total number of soldiers killed and wounded was about 23,000. In particular, the naval landing force suffered even more casualties on January 28th and 29th. Almost none of the 3,000 men survived. Admiral Osumi was deeply saddened by the news. He once wept and said to others: "The Empire has been training the Navy for 30 years, and it has always been praised by countries around the world. Now it has been beaten so badly by the Chinese army. If we encounter a powerful enemy in the future, it will be even more unimaginable."</p>

<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>Several days before our army retreated to the second line of defense, the Japanese army used aircraft to reconnoiter and drop bombs between Suzhou, Changzhou, Kunshan, and Taicang. Our people have suffered countless disasters. Mr. Xu Delin, a new employee of the county party headquarters in this county, told me about a tragedy after escaping from Luodian. So far, I have searched the newspapers in Suzhou and Shanghai, but there is no record of this. Therefore, I am urgently recording it to prove the brutality of the Japanese. When the Japanese army fiercely attacked Liuhe, the area around Luodian was often patrolled by Japanese aircraft. The villagers had become accustomed to it. Therefore, all the celebrations with relatives and friends were as usual. One day, in a village about two miles northeast of Luodian, a villager named Zhang was marrying a daughter-in-law for his son. He still followed the old-fashioned wedding ceremony. The auspicious time had arrived, and firecrackers were set off. At that time, a Japanese aircraft flew near the area. Suddenly, a crackling sound was heard. Assuming it was the firing of our army, they fled in a hurry. After a while, the sound of grinding in the sky became louder. A large number of bombers flew over and dropped bombs one after another. The villagers did not pay attention to it at first. At this point, they began to panic and tell each other. But the bombs had already fallen like rain, and flames were raging. They were unable to avoid and were buried in the fire. Before long, the entire village was destroyed. The dead were lying everywhere. The Japanese aircraft then soared away. Alas, the villagers were innocent and suffered this calamity. It was truly tragic.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Walking fish can only use their tails to swim in the water. This is known to everyone. In the eyes of ordinary people, when fish swim in the water, it seems that they rely on their caudal fins. The faster the caudal fin moves, the faster it swims. The muscles on both sides of the fish's body then allow it to swim freely in the water. However, after various tests, it is now known that fish can not only swim, but some fish can even come out of the water to climb trees or walk. Recently, many walking fish arrived at the London Zoo. They came from Java. When they come out of the water, they can use their pectoral fins as legs and feet to walk on the ground. There is also a kind of fish that can live outside the water for several days and can climb tall palm trees. The ancients said "(climbing trees to catch fish)" has really come true.</p>

<p>At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Shi Kefa supervised the army in Yangzhou, planning to recover lost territory. He used the Four Towns as a shield. The main generals of the Four Towns were Gao Jie, Huang Degong, Liu Zeqing, and Liu Liangzuo, all brave men. Among them, Gao Jie was the most tyrannical, and Huang Degong was the most valiant. It is a pity that they suspected each other and did not cooperate with each other, so they were defeated and destroyed by the Qing army. When Huang Degong first started out, he walked on foot as a whip-wielding servant for merchants. When he entered the capital via Shandong, he encountered bandits. The merchants all fled, but Degong alone held two donkey hooves to defend against the bandits. He was invincible and killed more than ten people. People were all surprised by this. Later, he made meritorious service in Hebei and was named Earl of Jingnan. He once defeated Zhang Xianzhong's roving bandits at Fangling in Qianshan, killing ten thousand of them. Zhang Xianzhong was almost captured. Degong was honest and loyal. Although his troops were not many, he always charged ahead in battle, as swift as a flash. The people of Jianghuai were amazed and called him invincible, calling him Huang Chuang. Among the roving bandits, there was a young and brave general called the Invincible General, who was the only one who did not submit. When he met Degong, he said to his comrades: "Why are you so timid? I will capture Huang Degong for you." The bandits all watched with bated breath. The Invincible General took a long knife and charged into battle, shouting with glaring eyes. He rushed to Degong. Degong brandished a golden mace and rode his horse to meet him. He immediately captured him, placed him horizontally on the horse, held down his shoulder with his left hand, and galloped away with his right hand whipping the horse. The bandits were demoralized and warned each other: "You must avoid Huang Chuang." His courage was like this. At this time of urgent foreign aggression, when we hear the drums and think of generals, brave warriors can revive the country. ▲ Correction: Yesterday's article was the second part.

<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Pitiable Night of Sharing Dreams, Forced into an Alliance Under the Bed, Still Remembers the Time of First Love, Betrays the Promise by the Window. An Yutian had a fellow-township relationship with her. He had met her in the assembly hall of the Beijing Students' Association of Fellow Townsmen early on, but they had not had any deep friendship. The reason why their two hearts suddenly came together was due to the medium of that whatchamacallit April 27th student movement. On that day, April 27th of the previous year, students from various national schools in Beijing, for some particularly major issue, suddenly launched a most violent student movement, gathering thousands and thousands of male and female students, marching in columns, flying various colored flags, shouting various slogans, distributing various leaflets, and heading mightily, like angry waves, to the location of government agencies to make some request. In fact, the request did not seem to be such a terribly scary thing. It was only laughable that those big figures in power were too timid. Upon receiving such a bizarre report, they stubbornly claimed that the students were going to come to kill and set fires. They were so scared that they were covered in excrement and urine. They didn't even care about opening any kind of national conference. They hurriedly ran away through the back door, disappearing without a trace. Someone, I don't know which high-minded big shot, having escaped to an extremely safe place, a room in a hotel in Dongjiaominxiang, somewhat calmed his frightened soul, and suddenly thought of issuing orders, deploying troops and defenses to preserve that big government office, lest it be truly destroyed by the students, so that officials could rely on the temple to receive incense forever. These several phone calls were made, and immediately countless teams of soldiers and police were transferred to the front of that government gate. Swords were drawn, bows were strung, guns were in hand, and cannons were arranged like a forest, surrounding the big government office layer upon layer like an iron barrel. Like facing a major enemy, they waited for the students to come and kill. Moving on, those many male and female students did come, shouting earth-shattering slogans, and the several representatives at the front, holding a petition like a doctoral dissertation, were about to step forward to submit the letter. However, they were blocked by the four iron-barred gates that were tightly closed. Immediately, they shook the iron bars and loudly negotiated a few words, but still no one came out to answer. Only a row of soldiers and police inside could be seen glaring at the students, their teeth gnashing, wanting to shout the students back. Thus, the students shouted outside, and the soldiers and police roared inside. Just as they were deadlocked, several small stones, no one knew where they came from, flew into the gate. The soldiers and police immediately obeyed the order to not start trouble first and to maintain order, thinking that they had an opportunity to act.</p>

<h3 id="e183">The Longevity Character in Wu Xiucai's Hall <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Wu Peifu's residence in Beiping has a longevity character written by a spirit medium hanging high in the hall. It is inscribed "Written by Qingxuan Elder, bestowed upon Zhixuan." Zhixuan is Wu Xiucai's religious name. I will not criticize Wu Xiucai's talent and character for now. However, Wu Xiucai can be said to be a superstitious person. Today, I will use Xiucai as an example to raise the issue of superstition and discuss it. In the end... what are the crimes of superstition? What are the benefits of not being superstitious? The slogan of eradicating superstition has long been shouted to the skies. In recent years, it has become even more vigorous. A few years ago, the city gods and earth gods suffered great misfortune, some were placed in cold palaces, and some were thrown into the Eastern Seas. Most pitifully, those fortune tellers who analyze characters, cast lots, and are blind were forced to change their professions. May I ask, in today's China, where livelihoods are declining, even highly educated university graduates or foreign-educated doctors and masters cannot find jobs for the time being. What profession can you ask a few blind gentlemen to change to? This is one example. Recently, in the battles in Wusong and Zhabei, countless amulets with the image of "Namo Amitabha" were found on the bodies of Japanese soldiers. The other day, they held a memorial service for the fallen soldiers and invited many Japanese monks to deliver the souls of foreign ghosts. Judging from this, the degree of superstition in Japan is not less than in our country, but their culture is still progressing, and their national strength is still expanding. It can be seen that superstition does not necessarily hinder culture, and it does not necessarily hinder the development of the country. On the other hand, not being superstitious has not been seen to have any benefits. This is another example. Indeed, I cannot say that their evolution is due to superstition, but I can also say that superstition has nothing to do with evolution. Our country's poor politics and backward culture are not improved through effort, but we are eagerly abandoning the fundamental for the superficial, and only making the eradication of superstition our task. As a result, we only lost the faith of ordinary men and women and increased the number of unemployed in an already boring life. What benefit is there in asking? If we go further, not to mention the extremely barbaric nations, even in European and American countries, how strong and widespread is the religious thought of their people? Is it not also superstition? In the end, it has not deprived them of the title of civilized countries, nor has it blocked their path to national strength. If we say it more broadly, everyone has some superstitious color. Since it is called superstition, there must be an object of superstition. The object does not necessarily have to be gods, demons, and ghosts to be considered superstition. Those who are enthusiastic about wealth and status take promotion and wealth as their object; those who are addicted to lust take modern girls as their object; those who like to drink old wine take Shaoxing sorghum as their object; those who have a hibiscus addiction take Chen Gong ointment as their object; those who are addicted to gambling take XX Company XX Association as their object; fashionable girls and frivolous young men take dance halls and movie theaters as their object; those who boast of extravagance take Western-style houses, cars, and the strange and beautiful clothes and luxurious items displayed in the three companies as their object. Can these objects not also be said to be superstition? If we ask a judge to judge the crimes of the above two types of superstition, I think the former is only a slight crime of negligence, while the latter is a crime of "public danger". Note: The crime of public danger is by no means explained in this way in law, but only a term is borrowed for application.</p>

<p>— Gu Zuliang</p>
<p>A gathering of heroes at the meeting to discuss national difficulties, competing to travel to the capital, Luoyang. Pacifying, relieving disasters, and resisting insults, the three major outlines must be clearly recognized. After all, the general's ambition is high, his heart still thinking of the Han Dynasty, vowing to leave Cao. If Lou Lan can be killed by you, your reputation will never be diminished.</p>

<p>— Bao Ren</p>
<p>The east wind blows rain again, Qingming, the Hu cavalry enter the Han city one after another. No wonder the brave troops number ten thousand, but they use peace talks to answer the rise of peace. The cannon rumbles, and the warships are tall, the banners and streamers embrace the sea, the rear army has no succession, losing the previous battle, sadly listening to the river wind roaring with angry waves. The sound of the machines rumbles, shaking the earth, looking back at Wusong with lingering sorrow, the coastal plants are mostly remnants, tears sprinkled on the riverbank to talk about the ashes of the disaster. The battle blood is still fishy, and the bones are not yet cold, enduring the humiliation to talk about sorrows and joys, who can save the sand worms and apes, the picturesque rivers and mountains are unbearable to look at.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Homemade Soda and Its Principles <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>The weather is getting hotter day by day, and soda (according to the Western name AeratedWater, the original meaning should be carbonic acid water) is also gradually on the market, so I specially write out the method of making soda, and at the same time make a simple exploration of soda. (A) Materials: (1) Citric acid (CitricacidHC6H5O7) | This acid is mostly contained in fruits, containing one molecule of water, forming colorless crystals, easily soluble in water, and the acidity is very refreshing. (2) Baking soda (BicarbonateofSodaNaHCO3) | That is, sodium bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda. The above two items are sold in pharmacies everywhere. (B) Preparation | Cold boiled water, soda bottles with marbles, fruit syrup, saccharin or sugar juice, other various spices such as banana oil, etc., a scale. (C) Method | First pour the fruit syrup, sugar juice, spices, etc. into the bottle, about one-quarter (using the bottle as a unit), then pour in cold boiled water, then use the scale to weigh one-tenth of baking soda, first pour it into the bottle, then press it tightly with your palm, wait for the citric acid to enter the bottle, then quickly cover the bottle mouth with your palm, and quickly turn the bottle upside down. The faster the better. Because citric acid immediately undergoes a chemical change when it encounters baking soda, producing a large amount of carbon dioxide. The marble in the bottle falls down by the force of the gas and adheres tightly to the rubber band at the bottle mouth. At this time, the soda can be considered complete. If you want to drink it, you only need to push down the marble, just like the ones sold on the market, it will produce a lot of gas. If it is done properly, the taste is no less than those sold on the market. (D) Principles and Functions | The principle of soda is that citric acid reacts with baking soda to produce carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide does not want to dissolve in water, but because the bottle mouth is tightly plugged, it cannot run out, so it has to dissolve in the water. When the stopper is opened, a part of the carbon dioxide runs out, and at the same time the pressure on the water surface is reduced, so the water bubbles, like boiling. The function is to be cool and refreshing, can quench thirst, and help digestion. Carbon dioxide entering the lungs is certainly harmful, but entering the stomach is not harmful. In addition, I would like to state that the soda sold on the market is not made in this way, because this method is only suitable for making a small amount, so it is only suitable for use in households. As for the soda on the market, it is made by using high pressure to dissolve a large amount of carbon dioxide in water, but the purpose is nothing more than to dissolve carbon dioxide in water.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Western-Suited Youths <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Among the pedestrians on Nanjing Road, if we make a statistic, then the Western-suited youths who come and go account for at least one or two tenths. This time when I returned to Songjiang, on the most prosperous Yue Temple Street, I encountered Western-suited youths, probably accounting for one or two percent. Then from Songjiang back to my hometown, that is a deserted market town, with a small population. In the past, you couldn't find a single Western-suited youth on the street, but now there are also two or three Western-suited youths, their leather shoes clattering, wandering in our town. The mentality of Chinese youths is that wearing a Western suit is so beautiful, which is nothing more than being impulsed by vanity. In today's society, a student of middle or higher status occasionally goes out for social occasions, and if he doesn't wear a Western suit, he will inevitably feel inferior among many Western-suited friends. Therefore, even friends who are so poor that they cannot pay tuition fees must prepare a Western suit. Especially when the waves of open male and female social interaction and free love are rising day by day, a young person who has reached the stage of seeking a spouse must go out to socialize. But in the social scene, if you don't wear a Western suit, you may not be able to win the favor of modern girls because you are not decent and not spirited. At the same time, they seem to gain a lot of face among their female companions when they have a Western-suited youth as a lover. Therefore, the recent preference of young people for Western suits can be regarded as a manifestation of vanity and the psychology of seeking love.</p>

Before this national crisis is resolved, we should no longer seek that mad entertainment." "Huh,..." A few days later, because of the special roadside, no, the attraction of the decorated advertisements touched the heart of A's lover. She invited him, probably because he really couldn't (?) reject her request, and they walked together, talking and laughing, towards the movie theater with its giant mouth that devours people. There was still more than a quarter of an hour before the show started. They casually looked around, and then ate the brought snacks and read the instructions for (XXX Story). "Hey! Old A, why, you came too?" "Yes... yes." "Didn't you say that before this national crisis is resolved, we should not seek that mad entertainment? How..." Y smiled...

<p>— Xi Wu</p>
<p>On a Sunday afternoon, when it was about to rain, the air in the room was very tense, making people feel very stuffy. Bored, I happened to flip through the anti-Japanese calendar on the wall. The content was lively anti-Japanese paintings, plus many celebrities' handwriting, which was shocking and indeed a good plan for anti-Japanese resistance. On page fourteen, it was titled with the big characters "Students are the soul of a country," and signed "Hu Lifu." Cough, is it him? No, this is the anti-Japanese (Hu Lifu). He is a celebrity, he is an intellectual, and he will never abandon anti-Japanese resistance to flatter Japan. I once read a statement by another (Hu Lifu) in the newspaper. How many Hu Lifus are there? If it's not him, who is it? Is there a third (Hu Lifu)? Doubts were winding around the strings of my heart!</p>

<p>||Catching Crickets Why is picking up cigarette butts called catching crickets? Even A San, who catches crickets, doesn't quite understand this himself. But he can be considered to fully understand what catching crickets is all about. Judging from A San's age, he is still as young as the young masters who go to elementary school in cars, but since last year, he had to start living independently. Among his little urchin companions, he learned to pick up cigarette butts, and this became his only way of life. Every day is the same, he has to take his small cloth bag to the road in the morning to make a living. Tram stops, movie theater entrances, and all lively places are his best places to wander. He crowds in the crowd, carefully and continuously searching for his only source of livelihood. Recently, this kind of life has not been easy to do. In addition to the original opium-smoking friends, those who do the same job have also added a lot of drifters from foreign countries. So sometimes they will suffer insults or beatings from them due to their older age for competing for a relatively large cigarette butt, and sometimes even bleed. However, long-term experience has given him many valuable lessons. For example, in places like Carter Road and Nicheng Bridge, although there are many cigarette butts, they are only left with a little bit, and the tobacco leaves are inferior. On the contrary, in the Bund, Great Road, and Jing'an Temple Road areas, almost all of the picked up cigarette butts are top-quality tobacco and a very long section. Good tobacco can be sold for a good price. Therefore, the working-class areas of Carter Road and other places are ultimately worthy of cursing. (× His mother! | Throw away a cigarette butt after smoking it to such a small point,...) When he could only pick up cigarette butts less than half an inch after several days of rain, he often cursed ruthlessly like this.</p>
