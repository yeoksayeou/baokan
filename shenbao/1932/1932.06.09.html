<p>時評</p>
<h3>法國赫里歐組閣以後</h3>
<p>翰</p>
<p>此次法國選舉左派勝利赫里歐進而組閣其皇皇宣言亦已昭示吾人矣。夫代議政活之更迭往往隨時勢環境而變遷。近頃國際風雲。日益緊急。經濟恐慌日趨危岌巫因河東岸希特勒之極端勢力劍拔弩張。咄咄逼人。獨於西岸。則鎭靜寂寞。得未曾有雖經杜美總統之變故。選舉秩序仍極安。定。絶未受絲毫影響而選舉結果德法相較。德右傾而法左傾。德法政治之趨向。相背而馳。尤爲惹人注目之現象。</p>
<p>赫里歐所領袖之激進社會黨其眞以社會主義爲政綱乎。法國政黨之左右分野。其眞以社會主義與反社會主義爲鴻溝乎斯兩問題。實爲研究法國政治所必待解决者。按法國政黨左右分野。已不能以理論爲爲疆界。當就事實作判斷。法國政臺上左傾之論調。右派亦已耳熟能詳。盡量摹倣。且繪聲繪色。鉅細畢肖一切左頌的剌激性尖銳性之名詞。已非自名左傾者所專有。是則法國之所謂左右傾。已不能專在言論上辨别之矣彼赫里歐都。固自名爲左傾者也。乃其在選舉運動中之演說。鄭重聲明。謂「吾人非革命者。但吾人决不失去社會性與國民性。」是則赫氏之左傾。爲不革命之左傾。向所持爲經典之社會主義。早已暫置高閣矣。最近近江國輿論。述法國之左右。傾以大地方爲右小地主爲左大企業爲右小工業爲左大資本家爲右。小資剷者爲左、以資産階級之大小爲左右之標準則其所謂左右亦可發一噱矣。　　吾人前嘗推測此次法國選舉赫里歐勢必出而組閣。其色彩將爲非左非右。今揆諸當前事實吾人之論斷尙未大謬赫氏所領袖之激進社會黨。曾與雷翁白崙所領袖之社會黨磋商合作。社會黨曾。提出最底限度之政綱。爲合作之條件。如積極實行裁軍。嚴厲監督銀行。提倡社會保險。歸併鐵路爲國有。實行每星期四十小時工作等。赫氏竟嚴詞拒之是則赫氏之政治主張。已與社會主義不相謀以此爲左。左亦有限</p>
<p>吾人根據以上觀察。敢斷定赫氏組閣以後之法國政治。仍將不斷的繼續普恩加賚泰狄歐輩衣鉢相傳之政策。再加上一層和平之保護已色而已。據最近電訊。法國對賠欵問題仍不肯作若何讓步。而赫氏之新閣成立宣言。亦仍以維持巴黎和約。國聯盟約羅加諾安全與仲裁條約。非戰約等爲歐洲和平之基礎。賠欵戰債之解决。以不損法國利益爲前提國際軍縮之實行以安全程度爲比例。則其所謂左派之政綱。與泰狄歐賴伐爾輩所領袖之右派政府較。相去亦無幾矣。</p>
<p>總之。法國現代政治舞台上。始終維持陳舊之情節。排列陳舊之佈景。而換以一般新的脚色而已。法國之政策不變。則德國之危機莫解。或且因此助張希特勒之勢力。加重帝國主義間之衝突吾人近顧國難之方殷。遥望世界之不安。誠不勝其焦灼也。</p>

<p>自由市之說益表面化</p>
<p>（東京）首相齋藤今晚以外相之資格與英美法意大使談話、其内容未經宣露、惟信四國大使已向說明各本國政府對於前外相芳澤五月十三日所提出建議之態度、此項建議、迄未正式發表、聞芳澤當時曾建議將上海改爲撤除軍備區或内之國際自由城、此訊外務省旣未徵實、亦未否認、故衆益信其確實、惟今悉芳澤曾提出計畫、以期使圓桌會議得早舉行、而謀上海之永久安全、（八日路透社電）</p>

<p>謂日本施其侵略與破壞條約政策、乃竟因此任令向中國强索讓與權、其理誠不明已云云、（八日路透社電）</p>

<h3>赫里歐獲得國會信任</h3>
<p>法衆院三九零對一五二票贊助新政府</p>
<p>赫里歐大政宣言爲取悅各派措詞温和</p>
<p>國民社七日巴黎電　今日法衆院以三九零票對一五二票、表决信任赫禮歐内閣通過新閣大政宣言、尙有六十議員放棄投票、此種表示、足以大增新内閣之力量、並可視爲贊成赫禮歐之外交政策</p>
<h3>同意票數少於預料</h3>
<p>路透社七日巴黎電　赫禮歐今日在衆院所發國際和平與好意之演詞已獲得同意票、惟票數不若預料之多、衆議員於聽取新總理言論後、投同意票者三百九十人、不同意者一百五十二人、未投票者五十人、赫禮歐此番言論、爲取悅左右兩翼而發、預料可獲滿塲一致之同意、乃投反對者人數尙多、誠出乎意外、社會黨投同意票、但其領袖白倫愼重聲明、此次投信任票、並非作該黨對於新政府願予以無疑問的援助之解云、赫禮歐旋即答稱、渠未能容許社會黨之投票影響其自由云、查投政府票者、爲赫氏所隸之急進社會黨、急進黨左翼、中央黨、及社會黨、新總理之言論、並未澄清歐洲大局其一番議論、以和平與好意爲主旨、新總理言及世界軍縮及賠欵問題、屢以法國安全爲言、而對於法國軍費預算則有立即縮减之切實表示、</p>
<h3>議塲中各派有爭辯</h3>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>法入塲者、不下數百人、但結果皆失望而去、下午二時四十五分、旁聽席已人滿爲患、外交人員及各議員、待至開會前最後數分鐘、始入議塲就席、議長於下午三時、登講壇、全塲鼓掌、移時、新内閣入塲、在政府席上、循次就坐、其時全院議席、已大致坐滿、前總理泰狄歐、坐於右側之中間、與多人握手寒暄、至三時十分、議長振鈴開會、全塲寂靜、議長蒲伊松、起立演說、首對已故之各舊議員、致誄詞、稱頌已故社美總統之爲人、並謂當此世l界恐慌之時、本屆議員任務、極爲重大、但須努力工作、不可悲觀、議長又稱贊議院内閣制度、謂其伸縮自如、能應付各種困難、至於法國酷愛和平之心理、於上次選舉、可以見之、蒲氏演詞、極爲會塲所歡迎、當其言及白里安、及多瑪二人時、鼓掌聲不絶於耳、稱頌杜美總統時、全塲除共産黨以外、均起立致敬、議長辭畢、乃請新總理赫禮歐、宣讀大總統致議會之咨文、會衆凝神諦聽、咨文讀畢、赫氏即郎讀内閣宣言、其時雖有共産黨議員、意圖擾亂、然衆院全體、對於赫禮歐之宣言、極爲注意、言及國際合作之必要時、掌聲大作、關於補償一層、左右中各派、一致鼓掌、赫禮歐又謂「文明民族、將戰爭置於法律之外、」此語一出、泰狄歐首先鼓掌、全塲掌聲、相繼而起、最後赫氏要求議院信任時、社會黨、急進社會黨、及中央派、一致鼓掌、少頃、議院請求將繋獄之共産黨議員拉曼德、予以開釋、議長又將質問政府大政方針之各要求、提出宣讀、内閣總理承認即時開始辯論、首先質問者、爲共和民主聯合派議員勃松、渠謂内閣政策、對於經濟方面、猶嫌不足、渠希望政府、能使「法國將有宣布世界和平之一日」之預言、得以實現云、議會旋於四時三十分休會、四時四十五分重開、彭古與勒盧、由參院出席歸來、入政府席、就座、共産黨議員陶利奥、提出關於社會政策之質問、要求政府、採用每週四十小時、及每日七小時之工作制、渠責社會黨、不應放棄其本黨政綱、而與急進黨政府合作、社會黨與共産黨、乃發生爭辯、陶利奥及於人聲嘈雜中、畢其辭、旋有下萊因地方議員、瓦爾德發言、謂黨以舠健政策、對付希脫拉主義、並要求政府</p>
<p>、以强有力之手段、救濟失業、共産黨議員班利、批評政府外交政策、謂其對遠東事變之態度爲不當、而對哈爾濱事件中之態度、尤盡量指摘、赫禮歐答稱、法國對遠東問題、尙未决定採取何種步驟、前航空部長哀那克、切實聲明左派急進系、將擁護政府、社會黨首領勃侖謂、社會黨决定對於政府、表示信任、並極言左派此次勝利、關係重大、左派無論如何、將利用此種勝利、勃侖又謂、法國之民主主義、愈臻鞏固、則世界和平、亦愈有把握、末又稱、政府每次之行動、如能表現左派之勝利、則社會黨、必將加以擁護云、旋泰狄歐登壇、中央及右派熱烈鼓掌、極左派與共産黨、則表示反抗、暄囂頗甚、議長乃命其遵守秩序、泰氏向左派聲稱「君等選舉中所得票數、增加百分之十、又以左派聯盟之故、所得席數、復增加百分之三十、急進社會黨、自一九一九年以來、常在兩極端之間、躊躇不决、對其友人、時而投票擁護、時而投票反對地君等之成功、實由左派聯盟所致」泰狄歐發言時、甚爲鎭靜、左派偶有憤怒之表示、輒以微笑、社會上黨開始騷導、亦屬無效、然泰狄歐仍繼續指責社會黨、謂該黨每次登台之後、輒放棄其平日所主張之軍事政策於不顧、而其所行之財政政策、往往使國家破産、泰氏謂、自一九二六年至一九三二年間之政治、實係建設和平之政治、例如楊格計畫、及白里安之非戰公約、均可稱道、泰氏對於前任政府之財政策、辯護甚力、並稱渠對於法國安全仲裁軍縮等主張、始終贊成泰氏談及政府聯盟時、謂社會黨與急進黨、僅於實施原則上、意見不能一致、最後乃問政府於軍縮會議中、對於法國主張、是否仍加擁護、若然則渠將請其友人、投信任票云、赫禮歐登壇答稱、關於外交政策之各項措施、皆已於内閣宣言中、明白確定、泰氏所問各節毁亦已包括在内、赫氏繼向共産黨陶利奥答稱、渠素在内、赫氏繼向共産黨陶利奥答稱、渠素極尊重工人、且法國對於减少工作時間之政策、將在日内瓦繼續主張、至於外交政策問題、赫氏謂一九二四年、渠擁護白里安政策、至今猶遵守此項政策、終不渝、赫氏對社會黨、深致感謝、但亦效社</p>
<p>會黨之態度、保留其獨立之地位云、赫禮歐與泰狄歐兩人、答辯頗久、至八時四十五分、經多數議員要求、暫行休息、八時五十五分、重行開會、泰狄歐又在本人席上發言、引起社會黨之抗議、共産黨宣言該黨將投反對政府票、旋宣告散會、議長乃將下列動議案、付表决、即「衆議院敬聆政府宣言之後、願信任政府、俾其按照國民最近表示之多數意見、施行政治、」結果、政府以三百九十票、對一百五</p>
<p>十二票之多數、取得議院之信任、</p>
<h3>泰狄歐欲辭去黨魁</h3>
<p>國民社八日巴黎電　昨夜法新總理赫禮歐在衆院所得信任票、更比昨夜所報爲多、反對者祗一百十五票、足見泰狄歐雖反對政府、其所屬共和左派議員、顯有一大部份投贊成票、或放棄投票、據稱泰氏因此頗憤黨紀之廢弛、正謀辭去黨魁、惟法報對於政府大政宣言、則未若國會擁護之熱誠、惟其中關於外交問題、除數家指爲過於謹細外、餘皆表示贊成</p>
<h3>英德各報論調一斑</h3>
<p>國民社八日柏林電　德報對于法新政府大政宣言、迄今仍以僅在標題中加以評論者爲多、皆謂其中並無新計劃、且所論多屬抽象、對於當今急要問題、未有具體解决辦法、貢獻世界云云、惟德文世界報所見較有希望、謂赫禮歐準備勉納德國對于賠欵問題之若干主張、</p>
<p>國民社八日倫敦電　今晨英報對於赫禮歐之大政宣言、類皆認爲足以增進洛桑會議成功之希望、即如泰晤士報及每日電報雖稱赫禮歐之方針、與前任内閣所異者、多在語調、至於原則鮮所變更、然亦對於最近之將來、認爲較多希望云、</p>

<h3>將下新緊急令</h3>
<p>對失業救濟制度</p>
<p>將有嚴峻的修改</p>
<p>國民社七日柏林電　今日從官廳方面徵實、德政府擬即撤消解散國家社會黨挺進隊、（即褐衫隊）命令之說、但據稱、此舉並非恢復舊狀、該隊將與其他半軍事性質機關、同受政府最嚴密之監督、至於撤消禁令之新命、或將合在新緊急命令之内、此項新緊急命令正在政府準備之中、本星期内大約可以發表、今日内閣曾爲此集會兩次、冀將政府所懷切要目標立即實現數種、據聞所擬新令中、封於失業救濟制度、將有嚴峻的修改、以期减省國庫開支、但料此舉必將引起工人强烈抗議、致政局益見緊張、更將有重大影響於新選舉、但聞政府已抱有决心、倘將來新選舉後、未能組成大多數之政府、决定解散再選、</p>

<h3>救濟農民計畫</h3>
<p>展延貸金償期一年</p>

<h3>國聯調查團抵平（二）</h3>
<p>專車早開、後聞日人在該處有種種佈置遂廢然作罷、車上一行人衆、無所事事、多往海濱游覽、或參觀開　礦務局、午後蔡元寗向南二民、由北戴河乘摇車至、各報及通信社記者、以在秦皇島不能工作、擬搭二時之慢車、先往山海關、乃屆時忽大雨傾盆、亦只得中止、</p>
<p>調查團車、係於二日由唐廠開至秦皇島、此車即上次調查團所乘坐、故佈置與上次完全無異、下午四時、開往山海關、先停於站之北月台、後又移於南月台、由北寗路輸運處長王奉瑞氏指揮一切、</p>
<p>山海關車站、已懸萬國旗及英文歡迎標語、南月台且建有臨榆縣各界歡迎彩轉樓、氣象爲之一新、記者下車視察、見車站之西房屋、已爲日人强改爲奉山路局售票處及站長辦公室、但門窗均關閉、僅留一警駐守於木栅之側、窗外又貼有新章則多種、其中最可注意者、爲車票必須在此處購買、南月台上之頭等女候車室、則改爲奉山路車務段及聯絡事務所、男候車室、則兼售酒及其他飲料、其屋外之杆上、且公然懸五色旗、詢之站上人員、此實創見、記者又至站外游覽、始知所謂滿洲國之國際警察、已爲避調查團耳目、暫時藏匿、而以便衣偵探代之矣、下午六時三刻、雨霽虹出、日人之壓道車已入月台、車上繪有黄綠花紋、係戰時淆亂敵人視線者、車中滿載日軍、日本代表處女秘書二人、及日本報館之攝影記者、亦附乘此車先至、七時旣屆、調查團專車亦到、車首所交×者、又五色旗也、第七旅長何柱國氏、率軍隊一排來迎、並有田氏小學童子軍十餘人、此時日軍官亦岔集、日軍人更梭巡於月台、帮同維持秩序、專車於軍樂聲中停止、各委員及顧代表、參議劉崇傑·蕭繼榮秘書施肇夔諸氏、魚貫而下、皆先與顧夫人握手爲禮、一時攝影記者、遂包圍於顧夫人左右、臨輸縣各界代表、特戩謁顧代表、以爲此行忍辱負重、勞苦功高、面致敬意、迨行李上下完畢、即換乘北寗路專車、於七時三刻開行、八時一刻抵秦皇島、初擬駐此過夜、旋恐保護不便、乃再開至北戴河海濱、車站亦建有彩牌樓、沿途綠樹叢中、紅燈照耀、頗爲悅目、朱光沐氏首先登車、與</p>
<p>顧代表商定次晨游覽秩序、並其他諸事宜、入夜當雨交作、但空氣凉爽、無不安然入睡</p>
<p>顧代表於百忙中、接見平津滬各報及通信社記者、答其所發諸問、大致謂一予此次參與調查團、去瀋陽吉林哈爾濱大連旅順鞍山等處、由鞍山回瀋陽、又去撫順、今日入關、車行所經、爲皇姑屯溝帮子錦州興城綏中前所等處、只錦州下車視察、勾留約一小時、予對此行、不願多言、所可奉告者、即同人所至、皆覺難受、所見皆傷心慘目、東北地面、爲沿海八九省大、可比德法二國面積之和、誠爲錦繡河山、天然寳藏、然今三千萬同胞、竟身受亡國痛苦、國人經過此次事變、應時刻將東北記在心頭、時刻勿忘三千萬同胞希望拯救、眼光要放遠、個人問題是小、</p>
<p>對外倘無辦法、必致玉石俱焚、中國人常自謂地大人衆、何致亡國、但一觀東北、即知其不可信、東北見只有日兵五萬、而三千萬人無如之何、同胞欲向吾人訴苦、而勢有所不敢、吾人欲向同胞致意、而勢有所不能、因日人監視甚嚴、來者必遭逮捕、呼籲無門、慘不忍言、但有一事可值</p>
<p>得注意者、即曾接到不少請願信函、内皆希望政府與關内同胞、從速設法、予以援手、予認保全東北領土及三千萬人民、無論在朝在野、皆有應盡責任、此爲目前最大之事、其他可暫勿顧問、言時幾於涙下、彼此相對黯然、末謂一切詳情、容到北平暢談、</p>
<p>五日天郎氣清、各委員有起身絶早下車散步者、因候李頓爵士、故至九時、始出發西山、公益會已備好人力車數十輛、車夫皆戴新草笠、着新號衣、藍布紅字、頗整齊、顧代表最前、各委員繼之、蜿蜒若長蛇之陣、隨處停留、參觀各莊、後發聯峯山之巔、國旗飛揚於上、美景盡收眼底、莫不心曠神怡、飄飄欲仙、迨至章莊進茶點、顧夫人已先在、操其如簧之英法語、周旋於各委員間、乃繼續領導至海濱各莊參觀、沿途只聞花香鳥語、疑是世外桃源、同人流連若不欲去、比回車站、已逾初定時刻半小時矣、</p>
<p>午後各記者又以書面向調查團有所詢問、李頓爵士代表答復、大要爲「此次到東北、自四月二十日至六月四日、完全爲搜集材料、即關於九一八事變之經過情形及以後至現在之狀况、此種材料、隨時送至日内瓦、以供參考、今尙在繼續工作中、故不能預有所主張、在東北雖曾遇許</p>
<p>多困難、但此種困難之給予、非日本政府、亦非日本軍事當局、而爲第三者、而調查團均忍耐對付、今幸已成過去、馬占山將軍之未能會晤、實因北滿戰事甚烈、前往時、須得東北地方當局與俄國之帮助、但此種帮助、終未獲得、至調查團之第二步工作、即希望利用中日兩國政府之誠意、而謀一解决之方法、但相信中日雙方、均有此誠意云云、</p>
<p>專車於正午離北戴河、何柱國旅長同車赴平、調查團曾邀往詢問由海關之近况極詳、下午五時過塘沽、中國代表處秘書李鴻拭游彌堅二氏、及陳宜春女士、亦由瀋陽經大連乘輪先到、在此登車、此三人在理、應隨同顧代表由陸路入關、而日人堅執不允、謂只能以赴長春之人數爲限、故不得不繞道、而日本代表處現已增至二十一人、謂與中國代表處赴瀋陽之人數相等、噫、日人氣量之狹、於此可見一斑、五時半抵天津、只停片刻、抵北平、已九時十分、因調查團請免除繁褥之點綴、故僅懸「歡迎國聯調查團」及「歡迎顧代表」中央文標晤、張學良氏等皆來迎、寒暄後、李頓爵士等一行、則赴北京飯店、</p>
<p>顧代表夫婦、則回鐵獅子胡同私宅休息、中國代表處人員、談及此行感想、英不憤慨非常、在長春吉林哈爾濱、被監視較在瀋陽尤嚴、調查團與當地官史之會晤、均</p>
<p>未參與、惟到處發見不少愛國志士、願爲祖國効死、覺東北民氣、非常可用、頃過所謂奉山路、則兩旁樹木、爲防義勇軍、均已截短、氣象荒凉已極、在錦州、日人只延調查團至交通大學視察、並指門上所繪日形、謂開時則分而爲二、乃華人排日之證、西人多笑之、錦州至山海關間、則見便衣隊甚多、有着長服者、有着短衣者、有戴帽者、有無帽者、有持棍者、有荷槍者、开式至不一律、總之不至東北、不知中國之危、一至東北、則愛國心自能油然增長矣、</p>
<p>調查團中人、雖守口如瓶、然私人談話、覺釀成此種局面、日人固甘爲戎首、而前任東北官僚、亦責無旁貸、此次對於所謂滿洲國、始終未加承認、不但一切招待未接受、即與溥儀鄭孝胥等晤見時、亦只用個人稱謂、可謂煞費苦心、當交涉北上面會馬占山時、日人竟謂調查團唯顧維鈞之言是聽、有擾亂地方治安、蔑視滿洲國之存在、其一手遮天之勢、蓋已盡收於明鏡之中矣、（六月六日）</p>
<h3>俄報鼓吹反日</h3>
<p>海參崴戰爭空氣濃厚</p>
<p>據東京萬朝報莫斯科電稱、蘇俄聯邦責日本右傾報紙、公然主張佔領海參嵗、其對蘇俄挑戰的態度、顯然暴露、莫斯科中央執行委員會機關報伊士威士恰報、發表社論曰、日本當局對於此種言論、並未取締、專在口頭上高唱與蘇俄聯邦保持平和、而不願與蘇俄締結不侵犯條約、其用意可見、又共産黨機關報、謂日本過信自國軍備之充實、一味挑戰、實爲其致命的失策、今日本帝國主義者、已由宣傳而進於行動之斯、吾人應積極準備云云、</p>
<p>東京報知新聞載稱、哈爾濱海參崴間之交通、依然杜絶、海參崴之戰爭空氣、亦其濃厚、該地官廳對日本人課法外之稅、凡僑居該地之日人、除日本總領事館員商事會社少數事務員合計三十四名外、其他日人完全被逐、他如與日人往來之俄人、則均流放於北部西伯利亞、從事嚴酷之勞役、且因物資缺乏、相繼餓斃、悲痛之狀、令人酸鼻、</p>

<p>名古屋新聞云、五月下旬之對外貿易、入超二千三十餘萬元、自一月以降、累計已達二億五千三百萬元、實破未曾有之記</p>
<p>錄、其不振主因、一因美國對日需用减少、其中棉花之輸入甚旺、而生絲之輸出銳减、加以對滬交易、前途遼遠、接收地仍布戒嚴令、客船之赴日本者、乘客極多、日本之赴上海者、逐漸减少、帝通商品、一時决難恢復、貿易狀况、愈陷不振云、</p>

<p>國立中央大學敎授第十五次會議、曾議决如於六月五日以前不發十二月上半月積欠、即行總請假、並將此决議案告知學校當局請其早爲准備、以免校務之停顿、及本月初學校領經費一部份、敎授會乃與劉代校長協商、以此欵先發十</p>

<p>十九</p>
<p>宋老太說：「好極了！我頂歡喜頭四句。從前的先生簡直是個閻羅王，小」孩子見了先生面，駭得比個小鬼還不如。我那小孫兒放在這種先生面前，老身何能放下心來。先生以小孩子爲小寳寳，我就無憂無慮了。」春生哥說：『「先生自種榖」足見先生看得起務農，我們農人一定歡迎。』我說：『這五首詩中，我有一句不大明白。「板凳黏屁股」是怎樣講？請先』生指敎。』</p>
<p>先生生說：『從前讀書人倒了霍，才願敎蒙童館。因此他的事業呌做「坐館」。在他們看來，坐館是個窮差使。因爲競爭的人不多，所以又呌做「坐冷板凳」。初坐上去的時候，難免覺得有點冰人、等到坐之旣久，則熱而黏起來了。這句詩是形容一個「坐而不做」的先生。現在呢？這板凳還是依舊的冷。一天勞苦之後，我們可以坐在上面休息：若是貪圖舒服依舊坐到黏起來，那就辜負了這條可貴的冷板凳了。在我給一位朋友的信裏，我曾進一步主張這種生活之改革。現在也不妨說出來請諸位指敎。我在這封信裏寫的是：</p>
<p>『從前的先生，』愛坐冷板凳。現代的先生，赤着脚挑糞。』我們聽了末了一句都忍不住的笑了。可是在笑聲中却流露了一種說不出的敬意。最後我問：『聽說有人談到敎師節是有「重士」的意義，朱先生以爲何如？』</p>
<p>朱先生說：『師是不是士？士該不該看重？重士是不是重師？我們要想把這些問題回答清楚，必先知道從前所謂之士究竟是什麽？這是古代農人對於「士」的認識而由我描寫出來的一幅「士」的小影：</p>
<p>『四體旣不勤，五榖也不分，達則做官去，窮則敎學生。』這樣的一類人在現代是不配受任何人的敬重了。從前那些好吃懶做的士是居四民之首。現在只有靠自己動手種田做工賺飯吃的人纔算是一品大百姓。士的地位是没落了。我們雖不可重士却不可不重師。敎人種田種得好的是農之師。敎人做工做得好是工之師。敎四萬萬國民起來拿民權，保民族，厚民生了以創造出一個名實相符的中華民國的是國民之師。農不重師則農必破産：工不重師則工必粗陋；國民不重師則國必不能富强。但是要人敬的必先自敬。重師首在師之自重。把頂戴去掉丨把博士帽，領士帽，學士帽去掉！把想比白工高一個頭的野心去掉！把一雙可以自由活動的手伸出來！「士」化爲「士」乃可以爲師。六六節的本意在重師丨丨重這樣的師。若是拿牠來維護士大夫的地位，那便是開倒車了。所以我認爲敎師節的重大意義在化士爲工，在化敎書之師而爲做工之師，敎人做實騐之工，做生産之工，做建設之工，做創造新鄉村，新中國，新世界之工。諸位　我這個意思對不對？』</p>
<p>領八百四十元、共五千八百八十元、又五組職員合領萬數千元、總計幾達三萬元、共挪移之專欵、自敎職員之存薪（即學校已發而敎職員尙未支取者）與學生之講義費實騐費外、尙有爲同人等所不忍言而又不得不言者、則爲同人等之水災捐欵、去歲同人等領九十月薪時、各扣水災捐欵十分之一、合計約達萬元、據會計組宣布、當時因欵項不足、捐欵皆係虚扣、然救災急於救火、續有欵項、自應儘先繳送國府收欵機關、乃朱前校長以上職員薪金、已領至今歲一月、而同人等去歲九十月所扣捐欵、至今猶未繳送、其爲朱前校長等領三月全薪時挪用、不言而明、災民之因此欵被挪用而死於溝壑者、更不知有若干人、而同人等及全校助敎各院系及圖書館職員、</p>
<p>於滬戰初起聲中、僅各得十一月份之二十元而已、同人等旣痛災民之無告、復感自身之艱困、徒以國難當前、隠忍而不敢向社會宣布、數月以來、滬事漸平、學校正式上課、政府自二月份起</p>
<p>亦按月發維持費三成五成、校中維持費之支配、皆取决於校務會議與敎授會各院代表、而出席校務會議者、自校長外、又皆屬敎授會同人、然同人等除主張全發薪水較低職員或加發成數、並預留全校事業費外、對於自身仍祗領三成五成、月僅得數十元及百數十元、雖因首都生活價之昂責、同人等仰事俯畜、時虞不給、然國家財政、旣支絀萬狀、同人等内則力維低薪職員生</p>

<p>紗花美棉始高繼回</p>
<h3>結果呈小俏之象</h3>
<p>昨日美棉初因利物浦消息良好而堅、後因天氣順利及華爾街不振而疲、計期貨漲二至四磅音、現貨不動、英棉期貨漲四至六點、現貨跌八點、埃及棉現貨跌五點、印棉停市、原電錄左、</p>

<h3>現紗未有做開</h3>
<p>人心都趨向軟化</p>
<p>棉紗現貨市况、未曾做開、商塲上集會者寥落星稀、因夏節大數休業、但人心多數趨疲、美棉微漲二四磅音　客方均現呆滯之狀、銷量甚少、蓋以世界大勢極其不振、海外紗價太廉、各方均被塞滿、本紗受其重大打撃也此時華紗各廠極應設法裝運各省地頭競銷、况原料廉宜、有利可圖、速宜乘機急追、使得底貨囤積輕鬆、但祗某巨商自己運往他埠兜銷、因之人鐘紗較爲緊俏、其他廠家囤貨日見增加、至於無錫紗亦陸續運申、查該處之紗向銷徐州濟南一路、現被靑島上岸之日紗搶去、因此祗得向滬上求出路、第二原因農村衰敗、經濟不振、内地人民購買無力、有此種種原因、標紗有一部份心理、預測見一百四十五兩左右云、</p>
<p>絲茶軍事影響</p>
<h3>崑山蠶收絶無希望</h3>
<p>崑山四鄉蠶事、近年來漸見進展、東門外天十四圖及重二圖蓬間鎭等處農民、均注重蠶桑、無如滬變突起、國軍退駐崑山、四鄉掘挖戰嚎、農蠶備受影響春蠶均未飼育、迨和議告成、軍隊撤防蠶事已告終了、雖有少數農民植有桑田者補育晚蠶、奈寒暖無度、雨多晴少、蠶蟻發育不利、蠶病叢生、東外各圖雖有上　之蠶而日暖放凉、吐絲遲滯、今歲崑邑春蠶、收成勢必絶望云、</p>
<h3>洋莊絲經夏節無市</h3>
<p>昨爲歷屆習俗相沿之夏節、華洋絲商均循例休業一天、洋莊絲經無市、例無市面可報云、</p>
<h3>婺源新茶銷暢價堅</h3>
<p>昨爲婺邑新茶開秤之第七日、雖滬市茶訉不良、山價並未因而降落、蓋茶號迫於塲面已開、勢不能中輟、山户以存茶日少、堅不落價、故昨日各鄉開秤、盤價仍在五十餘元至八十元之間、與前數日無大差異、計北鄉浙源·梨坑·六十六元、洪源·和坑口七十元、六堡源·岩下五十五元、路下程·洪村·横亭六十元、硤石·詩村五十六元、程家七十元、甲椿八十元、南鄉太白五十八元冰坑六十元、西鄉甲道五十六元五角、湖山五十九元、叢山七十元、各號進茶數量、均在百餘担不等、大約可敷製首帮所需、其中以高岸粤商謙吉祥、已進三百餘担、觀日來號方需求之殷、盤價似難落下、進茶之號、連日均一律開始揀焙、趕製珍眉等細貨運滬云、</p>
<h3>屯溪茶市頓趨冷淡</h3>
<p>屯溪茶號、自接申市外銷不振、態度頓趨消極、各號進茶數量、均極稀少、昨日休屬上溪口開秤、出盤七十五元、葉質稍劣之貨、出盤六十元、本埠外茶進口、未臻踴躍、僅少數歙縣販貨、零星議沽、行茶尙無大批新貨上市、故屯號開製者、現尙不及十分之半、市勢殊形不振云、</p>
<h3>浮梁茶正式開秤</h3>
<p>浮屬東南兩鄉靑茶、各山户均採製告竣休婺茶販、咸紛紛麕集各村搜買、且出産嫩頭、號販多樂强進、連日各地談盤結果、已正式開秤、市盤自四十八元至六十元、頭批新貨、已陸續運出、二批又正在搜辦中、</p>
<h3>祁門茶市之尾聲</h3>
<p>祁門紅茶、因多雨出貨不旺、各號進茶稀少、</p>
<p>往年每帮有一百箱者、今年僅做七八十箱、最少者只五六十箱、現雖將告收塲、其間少數茶號、欲須加辦、凑做尾帮、近日祁南江家河遲茶、山户仍有採制、市價自三十元至四十元、還有因經濟不敷開銷、勢成擱淺、一時難即收塲云、</p>
<h3>五金蛋廠帮購辦馬口鐵</h3>
<p>馬口鐵市面近甚良佳、蓋異軍突起之蛋廠帮、昨有鉅數收辦、成交甚廣、行情異常堅秀、一百磅美貨又開三十一兩、英貨二十五兩、九十磅美貨估十四兩、英貨估十兩、聞市况仍看漲風云、</p>
<h3>煤炭開平煤鬆動</h3>
<p>開平煤塊屑各貨、近來到頭頗旺、棧存亦夥是以售價、略有鬆動、日昨市塲售開、每噸均跌三四錢、計現售一號屑每噸八兩六錢、二號屑八</p>
<p>兩二錢、林西塊九兩云、</p>

<h3>日軍允卽撤盡</h3>
<p>日内當有答復</p>
<p>關於日軍撤退問題、昨晨共同委員會日方委員岡崎、復有電話通知我方委員俞鴻鈞云、現日方駐滬海軍當局、適值新舊交替之際、故對於此問題、新舊官吏、均無暇顧及、尙須假以時日、續與新任海軍司令協商、一俟商有結果、即行答復云云、事後、據俞秘書長向遠東社記者表示、謂日方態度、尙屬誠意、故日軍撤退、可不成問題、不過時間上或尙須有一二日之延擱、但日方旣有此種情形、我人亦應予以諒解、從緩一二日、當亦無不可也云云、</p>
<p>據市長吳鐵城氏語華東社配者云、關於日軍撤退問題、日方已有即日撤退之表示、惟現因新舊交替、於手續上將展緩數日、關於連日閘北方面、謡諑紛繁、吳市長昨日正式聲明、此項事件、完全係屬奸人造謡挑撥、如六日晚天通庵路附近有人放槍、外間疑爲日軍挑釁、現經調查證明不確、並已拘獲嫌疑犯兩名、又日來吳淞江灣閘北等處、常有日軍來往示威、吳市長謂、此乃日軍因該項區域、尙有日憲兵等駐在、不時來往換防、居民不察、遂起誤會云云、</p>

<p>國電氣公司全體工友云、中國電氣公司全體工友們、自九一八事件發生以來、美帝國主義電話資本家、對於我們電話工人的壓迫與剥削、更加凶蠻殘酷了、兩月來我們電話工友、被開除的已經數百餘人了、現在資本家又要在六月份開除三四百人、而雇用白俄來代替中國工人的工作、同時並將禮拜工與每年四月增加工資的慣例、也都取消、我們累年累月血汗積下來的儲蓄金、也往往被資本家藉故尅扣充公、資本家對於我們電話工人的壓迨和剥削的罪惡、絶非筆墨所能盡述現在我們已宣佈全體罷工、希望你們與我們表同情、不要受人利用、爲電話公司工作、</p>

<h3>毆郭辯護意旨</h3>
<p>第二特區地方法院檢察官就郭泰祺在寓邸被設事件、對各團體救詞聯合會各代表檢舉一案、自上月十六日一度債訉後、久無消息、現由陸紹宗俞踵駱兩律師爲李次山等撰一辯護護意旨書、催請速行處分、因此案甚爲社會所注目、特將其書採錄如後、</p>
<p>爲協助被告李次山·殷芝齡·楊鎔偉·謝承平·沈祖儒等、就妨害公務之嫌疑一案、陳明辯解意旨事、查本案於五月十六日奉傳各被告到案債查、羅未依刑訴法第六十條詳示犯罪之嫌疑及罪名、惟庭諭係就五月三日郭泰褀被人毆傷事件爲偵查、而所發傳票、載明案由爲妨害公務、得以</p>
<p>推知李次山等、係因受有刑法第一百四十二條之犯罪嫌疑、故被傳案偵訉、若郭泰祺受傷之被害部分、因其先已表示不願訴究、自不在檢察官應依職權偵查範圍之内、本律師因請求查閱卷證、並知本案偵查、完全發自鈞處之職權行動、非如謡傳之受有行政上指挥、吾人本於尊重法權之素志、良用佩慰、所不能已於言者、法律之前、人人平等郭泰祺於受傷後就診於醫院、依刑訴法第九四條、就其所在爲訉問、雖無可議若其眷屬僕從、則無不能到案之理由、乃亦就郭氏住宅訉問之、使被告等不能就各該人證之錯誤陳述、而質縀正、殊爲憾事、又查曾在郭氏住宅内訉問之證人金生阿吳及徐愛梅等、於五月十六日偵訉日期、雖在傳喚之列、詎竟抗傳不到、郭泰祺早已傷愈出院尙未傳喚到案、使與被告質對、究竟此在訴訟法上應再踐行如何之程序、鈞處自能依法處分、姑置不論、今惟就本事件說明李次山等毫無犯罪嫌疑之辯解理由、以供明察、</p>
<p>（一）查李次山·殷芝齡·楊鎔偉·謝承平四被告、於·</p>
<p>時三十分之間、（見郭泰祺本人口供、郭徐德荃所繕報告及法租界捕房政事處長薩爾理報告譯文、）而郭氏因就浴延滯、至接見之時、已在九時至九時三十分之間、（見金生供及薩爾理報告譯文、）是李殷楊謝四人到郭宅後、坐守近一小時之久、始獲接見、假令郭泰祺是日無就浴之稽延、則在沈祖儒續到請見之前、當已與李殷楊謝接談完畢、無復與續來者會見機會、又何致因人多口雜、而釀成毆撃之事、郭氏是否每晨皆浴、固非李殷楊謝所能知、是日請見適在浴時、須守候一時之久、而後得見、尤非李殷楊謝所能先知、謂其有組織、分先後預約打手、於一小時後來施暴行、實爲不合情理之苛論、此就李殷楊謝四被告坐候接見時間、非所預期之點審究之、可知當郭氏接見李殷楊謝時擁來行兇之人、皆屬偶然會合、其行爲與李殷楊謝四被告之請見、旣無因果聯絡、其責任自與李殷楊謝無所涉、</p>
<p>（二）沈祖儒雖與第二批續到之人偶然會合　同時請見、然在請見時、先投名剌、彬彬有禮、一如李殷楊謝之先經通報、苟爲行兇而來、或與其他同來之人有所謀合當不致獨留形迹、以待事後之召捕、且沈祖儒進見以後、續到不識姓名者、更有數批據捕房報告稱、郭氏正談話間、突有靑年學生二十餘人郭君會客室、大呼打倒郭泰祺、内有一人奪取茶杯　　擲去等議、是此二十餘靑年學生非與沈祖儒同時來見、已有明證、傷郭者縱可謂出自此突來之二十餘靑年學生、而此二十餘靑年學生究爲何人所召致、並無綫案可尋、又何能任意羅織、使非與此二十餘靑年學生同時求見之沈祖儒負同謀之責、</p>
<p>（三）五月三日郭泰祺被姓名者撃傷後、羣衆早作鳥獸散、留而未去者僅李殷楊謝沈等被告及新聞紀者數人而已、其所以不即離去郭宅之原因、在新聞記者固欲詳知郭泰祺傷後情狀、而李殷楊謝沈等被告、則以郭氏突遭强暴公誼私交、均應懇切慰問、兼之中懷坦白、不欲亟圖引避、假令事出同謀當已隨衆逃避之不遑又豈肯坐待召致巡捕之查究　故當外部顧問夏奇峯君將經過情形電告捕房、經其指派福煦捕房留備隊趕至郭宅時、各行兇人早已急即逃去、（見薩爾理報告）被告等雖曾奉命借往捕房候訉、初未被郭氏指爲嫌疑人犯、李次山殷芝齡兩人且承郭泰祺商諸夏奇峯君、先爲保釋、足見郭泰祺就當時親身目覩情形亦無疑及李殷諸人之理由事後以其眷屬僕從之附會傳說、一變磊落光明之態度、因多疑而見理失眞、誤認加害者先事有何組織殊不知郭氏被撃、當時坐立擁擠於室内外者、識與不識何慮百數十人、據郭氏内姪女徐愛梅所供一室内坐滿三四十人之多、而郭泰祺本人供稱、動手行兇約計不過四五人、就中　茶杯者一人、餘僅抛擲銅元而已、倘謂其先有組織、而確信郭泰祺爲喪權辱國者之爪牙、擬一致予以懲儆、求達防阻簽訂賣國協定之目的則以三四十乃至百數十人之衆、一聲鼓譟養足交加即不難立使郭泰祺粉身碎骨了其殘生又何必僅以一人摜茶杯、三四衆擲銅元、傷其一額而止而逃故就郭氏之受傷狀况言、不但可斷定李殷楊謝沈等五被告未嘗與聞其事、且可兼以證明在逃不識姓名之四五兇手、亦屬當塲激於一時之義憤、登而爲不能以理智駕馭感情之衝動、絶未抱有任何目的、更有何事先組織之可言、郭氏因事後檢得銅元二三百枚、及銅元皆有包紙、而驟執爲先有組織之馮據、所見不廣、抑何可笑、（四）卷查本案偵查狀况、依郭泰祺本人及其眷屬僕從之供述、有足使李殷楊謝沈等五被告、遭受疑似之嫌者、厥爲（一）各人證供稱、先進之四代表中、有一穿中山裝者、出去招手、呌進許多人來、（昂金生徐愛梅郭泰祺供詞、及郭徐德荃所書之報告、）及（二）郭泰祺供稱、「老媽子阿吳和我内人的姪女、看到沈祖儒在外面大駡、並指使這班兇手逃走」兩點而已、茲再針對各該供述、分须闢謬如次、（）一查金生及徐愛梅供詞、並未指明首先來見四代表中之穿中山裝者、是何名姓、但據郭泰祺本人供稱、「我只有以先進來的四個代表是認識的、」則四代表之名姓、當爲郭氏所素悉、而是日四代表中、何人服中山裝、旣爲郭氏所目覩、則中山裝者究爲何人、郭氏不難應聲而舉其姓名、何以至今尙游移其詞、捉摸未定、李殷楊謝四代表中、究有何人服中山裝、郭泰祺旣未到案明確指認、自不能因其眷屬僕從有此傳說、信以爲眞、又查金生供謂、「穿中山裝者在外面招人進來、」徐愛梅供謂、「郭太太看見穿中山裝的出去呌進許多人來、」詞皆肯定、而郭妻徐德荃親筆所書報告、則僅稱「並見室内另有穿中山裝少年欲出門外、似有呼人模樣、」又麗疑似未定之區、執與徐愛梅等肯定之供詞較、亦顯見彼此有所附會才盾、不　　合、以此而謂李股楊謝四被告於毆郭事件有嫌疑、其嫌疑亦萬分薄弱、於檢舉後之公訴、何所裨益、（二）就文字上觀察、郭泰祺本人旣供稱「老媽子阿吳和我内人的姪女看到沈祖儒在外面大駡、並指使進班兇手逃走、」似於毆郭事件、沈祖儒涉有重大嫌疑、但沈祖儒之「大駡」及「指使兇手逃走、」旣非郭所目覩、需阿吳原供、「我只看見有一年四十多歲有鬍髭著長衣裳的人、在外面駡、」徐愛梅原供亦稱、「見有一鬍髭約四十多歲的人在外面駡什麽賣國賊、」均未指明此駡者爲沈祖儒、且已明白辨議其人之年貌、老而多髭、適與現在被傳到案之沈祖儒年少無髭者不相若、郭泰祺又何能據此傳說、即武斷其人爲沈祖儒、尤可怪者、郭妻徐德荃所繕具之報告、竟有所謂長鬚老人沈祖儒者、語凡兩見、曰「郭夫人聞有客來、即下樓察視、見長鬚老人沈祖儒亦在室内守候、」曰「並見長鬚老人沈祖儒、由客室内倉惶逃出、大呼口號賣國奴、打死你等語、」此屬郭妻徐德荃筆述其親自目覩之事實、在法律上應負紹當之言責、不容諉爲舛誤、然在情理上、旣已倉惶逃走、當不致再呼口號、而郭妻徐德荃所述聞得之口號爲「賣國奴、」「打死你、」而徐愛梅述其聞得之駡聲、則爲「賣國賊、」同時同地、對於同一人之見聞、竟不一致、沈祖儒固無化身易容之術、乃沈祖儒姓名之上、冠以長鬚老人四字、謂非當時目瞀神昏、或事後有意附會、而故爲羅織人罪、又何至謬誤至此、以上皆就事實上被告涉及疑似之嫌、詳爲辯解、已可斷爲嫌疑不足、依刑訴法第二四四條第二疑之規定、即應爲不起訴之處分、至郭泰祺雖有被人毆撃之事實、然以其被毆當時、非在執行職務之際、其簽訂五五協定、於法又顯多可議、事前民衆激於愛國狂熱、防阻當局之喪權辱國、不能與犯罪同論等、法律上見解、已由本案共同辯護人趙琛律師、另具辯護意旨書、言之綦詳、本律師以爲法律上之見解、都屬退步而言之、辯解理由、而在本案事實上偵訉、未能獲得李殷楊謝沈等五被告有同謀參預毆郭事件之相當證據前、尙無提前討論之必要、故雖贊同趙琛律師之辯護意旨、仍希望鈞處逕依事實上查無嫌疑證據之理由、以不起訴終結偵查之處分、藉免訟累無辜、謹呈上海第二特區地方法院檢察處、辯護人俞鍾駱律師、陸紹宗律師</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語录</p>
<h3>原物</h3>
<p>— 梅花</p>
<p>吾從小就歡喜研究科學，吾對於數學，物理，化學，都有特殊的興趣。吾到上海讀書的時候，西洋的科學剛在那時起頭發展。吾還記得曾拿眞空的　瓶製造煤氣，居然可以燃一二分鐘之久，又曾拿玻璃管擦羊毛布，擦後可以吸紙屑。吾常拿這些物理試騐當做消遣的玩意兒。人家看了往往奇怪，其實他們都不知道炭氣可以發火，玻璃管經磨擦後可以發生電磁的作用。吾還和他們開玩笑，說吾可以玻璃做琥珀咧！</p>
<p>說起琥珀，就要想到「琥珀拾芥」「磁石引針」的老古話。這些事實在漢朝時代早就發現，可是大家都說不出原因，而且也不肯推究其原因；弄得没有法子的時候，就歸到甚麽陰陽的感化，玄妙得不可思議。</p>
<p>原來科學必須有抽象，没有抽象就不能概括一切。中國人抽象的力量很薄弱，這是科學不發達的大原因。古人說得好，「物有本末，事有先後」有果必有因，可是中國向來對於這原則的應用，偏重於行爲方面，而不重學問。祇講「原行，」而少講「原理，」祇講「原道，而少講「原物。」</p>
<h3>戰地素描之一</h3>
<p>— 錢台生</p>
<p>丨北站到寳山路</p>
<p>戰時緊張的情氛消滅了。來代替他的。自然還是和平氛園中歌舞昇平的享樂。</p>
<p>首當其衝的北站。要是你高興。還是可以以看電影的眼光去留一趟的好因爲那異國軍人猙獰地持着劍光的步槍站着崗位的時候。我們凛然的以未能一親我中華國土的機會而悵惘。在當你自由地可以張着臂走進那親切的殘碎的北車站時。你將又發生怎樣的感喟呢。而一般扭着腰枝狹狹長長旗袍的姑娘。那清膽的高跟鞋踏上了才抹去血漬的月台上。這又令人返映出什麽印象呢。</p>
<p>殘破的北站呵。你太使人感喟了。</p>
<p>除了票房還保持着舊狀以外。所有的貨棧月台。和三樓的建築。那粉碎的屍駭丨碍瓦和粉灰。傾頽在四地。正門的三樓。還剩着一個殼傾圯的牆壁。上面正還有着工人在拆卸磚瓦。這大約和「收復失地」一樣。慢慢的設法恢復舊狀吧。</p>
<p>出了北站。沿着滬寗車站路走向寳山路。這一條路上。已可想見戰時肉搏血浴的情景。沿馬路的住宅牆上還有着兵士臨時開的長方槍泂。每一塊磚瓦上還留着槍彈火迸的痕跡。擋路二梗鐵的柱子上。可以很明顯的找到每一顆子彈穿入人類皮膚的力量。那和槍靶一樣的。鑿滿了蜂窩的形象。</p>
<p>走入寳山路。經過虬江路。寳昌路到寳興路。一直到那五層大厦的東方圖書館和對面的商務印書館。</p>
<p>因爲參觀「戰地」。並且曾在砲火中跳躍。血花中傾頽的建築。一條寳山路上。我們没看見較完整的建築。能射在眼簾</p>
<h3>寄陶配三南京</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>君游陜洛興如何，歷歷鴻踪雪印過，一度春來新草，萬方刦後舊山河，珠槃徧歃盟書在，鐵軌横施戰骨多，難道白頭競頑健，江南風月遂要娑。</p>
<h3>挽丹徒荆夢蝶</h3>
<p>— 錢小山</p>
<p>菊社初逢日，黄花細雨天，（同邑章百熙夏憶鹤曾以菊宴相招，爲予識夢蝶之始，）狂來巾漉酒，喜得雁傳箋，（夢蝶曾有亦園雅集記，見本談，稱道吾家君，并及予，）世亂猶爲客，才多不永年，莊周眞蝶化，落月一悽然。（夢蝶爲梁溪榮氏記室，近以霍亂逝世，傷哉丨）</p>
<p>裏的。無非那經過烈火洗禮。大砲炸彈轟炸過那撕得粉碎的樣子。丨從日軍撤退。我們來接收這破碎的寳山路以後。頓然把南京路四馬路迷夢中的靑年男女拖到這戰塲上來了。</p>
<p>寳山路上的住民。果然要哭無涙。而我們中華國民對這殘碎的國土。又有怎樣的感覺呢。</p>
<h3>犧牲於滬戰之情侣</h3>
<p>— 天恨</p>
<p>兵兇戰危。古有明訓。此次日軍侵我淞滬。發生大戰。綿亘三十二晝夜。其兇其危。爲我國念年來所有戰爭任何一役之冠。以敵軍有飛機肆虐。勿論爲前線。爲後方。胥受其殘害也。此三十二晝夜中。不知有幾許配偶。因之離散或死亡。不復能聚。尤屬人間最慘痛之事。乃據友人告我。竟有他埠情侣。亦無端犧牲於此一役中者。其人姓吳、家頗殷實。曾畢中學業、鍾情於同里某女校敎員李女士。故年已二十有五。尙未授室。蓋吳父係一商人。頭腦甚舊。以爲李家赤貧。女父又死。祗其母健在。恃女執敎鞭爲活。不願媳之也。且不知因何理由。非厭惡女子之爲敎員者。吳數數請於其前。要求娶李。皆遭峻斥。其後遂不敢言。但每值其父與之論婚時。吳亦竭力反對。用是父子間感情殊劣。女雖鍾情。然較吳曠達。有思想。嘗勸其勿忤慈顔。謂我儕之愛。重在精神。曷爲斤斤於夫婦形式。渠無伯叔。又無兄弟。祗有一母。此焭焭孑影。無論得嫁吳與否。渠將終身不嬪他人。若得嫁吳固佳。不則誓與吳爲精神夫婦。願吳勿過逆親意。奈吳殊不若女之曠達。居恒戚戚然。逮去冬。吳父忽與邑之某富商成莫逆。商有一女。亦甚明慧。遂婚焉。此次吳父必欲其成。不問吳意。逕繋赤繩。吳聞而大恚。訴諸女。女又勸之。吳怫然曰。然則我當離此處。海角天涯。一任萍飄可也。言已逕出。女隨後詢曰。往何處去。曰。我先到上海。且言且行。略不返顧。但聞女言曰。汝爲我出亡。我要忍獨留。當與君偕行也。吳終不顧。翌晨竟悄然來滬。孰意不數日即發生大戰。頓念女有「不忍獨留」語。其果追踪而來耶。來則必至閘北。以女知其有至友在閘北也。則不禁大慮。是時吳適寓其友在租界之小家庭中。故未及難。旣而得故鄉消息。女果到滬。因設法冒險赴閘北探訪。則聞女竟已慘死。吳一慟幾絶。及歸友寓。數日亦死。</p>
<h3>廉儉救國說（六）</h3>
<p>— 聶曾紀芬述男其杰撰文</p>
<p>以上所舉明君良將相。皆能以儉德律身而福利强大其國之證。此即中國禮敎之本旨。然則道德果消極乎。更證以西國近事。如華盛頓林肯。皆以廉儉私德聞於世。其成就之偉大。人所截知。無待贅述。再造意大利之加富爾。以身許國。立志不娶。以成大業。現任德總理普魯寗。獨身不娶。所得月俸。除食用外。盡還國庫。不蓄私財。故德人雖處極困苦之境。猶能與政府合作。羣稱普氏爲德國救星。俄之史丹林。能使國人耐苦力作。以成其五年計劃。而人樂從。以其能自儉苦。與衆無異。而忠實爲人所信故也。印度甘地。爲今世之第一英傑。其所以能爲國人信仰景從者。亦由其刻苦自厲有以致之。甘氏日食。飯止一蔬。及羊乳少許。其所著衣服。乃自紡之紗所織。一切洋貨皆不用。乃至輪船火車皆不坐。雖千里亦徒步以赴之。今人以爲利用科學發明。足以增加辦事之功效。然歐美人個人功效。有能如甘氏者乎。世有不戰而能屈人之兵者。甘氏是也。先文正公有言。精神愈明。此意惟能努力者自知之耳。以上所述。我國先民。及泰西賢哲。德業事功有成效者。英不對於一己深自貶抑。使肉體享用至最小限度。約而言之。即克己制欲而已矣。</p>
<h3>記白蓮藕粉</h3>
<p>— 綉球庵主</p>
<p>前者偶讀紫蘭花片。所載訝介子之清平樂詞。盛稱無錫東大池之美。其詞中有云。「溪山幽蒨。隄畔新妝現。小别桃花紅更艶。又異舊時人面。遠峯眉黛糢糊。綠楊秀髮新梳。巧對一泓明鏡。比他西子何如」。適值春光明媚。景色宜人之時。益動游興。爰與程君竹平。偷得一日閒。往踐汪鵬翔君之約。</p>
<p>余等甫抵無錫。逕往東大池。逕見桃花盛開。紅雲片片。映以綠柳。益增嫵媚。池水澄清。光明如鏡。沿池有小徑。夾徑種桃花無數。中有白色。及玫瑰紫色者。尤覺相映成趣。</p>
<p>小徑旣盡。有長橋一。登亭四望。山水桃柳。盡收眼底。殊令人有世外桃源之感。</p>
<p>離大池。即往梅園。梅花已謝。餘香猶在。園中有軒曰。餐英。余等就之小憇。時已逾午。飢腸微鳴。鵬翔乃出其所携藕粉。先以冷開水調匀。。再以沸水。隨冲隨調。清香四溢。而富潤膩厚。余訝其不似尋常品。詢之。鵬翔曰。先曾祖筱塘公。以藕粉爲養生上品。而慨於市售者。頗多雜僞。乃不惜心力。督率家人。採購眞白蓮藕。研究製造。故所成之粉。純凈異常。余父昔曾蓮赴南洋勸業會賽會。沐奬金牌。遐邇馳名。余聞言。索視商標。竹平笑日。君欲購者。請認明黎陽汪經畬堂。庶不致誤。相與一笑而歸。（却酬）</p>
<p>短訊　求幸福齋主何海鳴君。近鑒於國難方亟。特提倡戰爭文學。以此次滬戰爲背景。串揷一愛情故事。寫戰事小說一部。曰「黄浦血痕」。計二十四回。每回五千字。共約十二萬言。現已寫竣。但尙未定何家書肆印行。日來頗多寄函天津法界益安里十四號何庽接洽者。此書如出版後。當可于戰爭文學中放一異彩云。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙棲記（七三）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第九回　附專車逐客有虚驚　坐冷衙化石成遐想</p>
<p>到了前門車站。只見站上異常冷靜。僅有一些排隊送行的軍警和樂隊。早來到月台邊。在那灰黯不明的電燈柱下。木雞似的呆立著。隨又找著一列專車摸上車去。見裏面黑魃魃寂止無聲。好不陰慘。那郭副官解釋著道。此刻車頭還没掛上。電燈没接綫。人也未到齊。才準有空位置呢。但黑暗中史見一長條許多包房的門全關得很嚴。不知開那個房間是好。郭副官在過道上一壁來回亂跑。一壁高呌什麽朱副官。大概這朱副官便是這車上管理專員。要找他才能設法。呌了半晌。恍惚聽有一聲極微弱的聲氣在一間包房内答應。郭副官摸著了方向。領著安玉田推門而入。見裏面窗子邊一張小木几上。點著半段殘蠟。蠟花開得很大。光圈閃動著並不明亮。只依稀看出内中是左右兩排床位。上下共分二層。都已經吊扯起來。倒是個舊式頭等臥車。左邊高舖上正躺著那個朱副官。從朦朧初醒兩眼惺㳂中伏著床沿。問明了郭副官的來意。信手朝下一指道。就是這底下的床舖罷。郭副官見移交已畢。再没有他的事。一聲不響的拔腿便走。安玉田坐下來。仰面朝上。正想與那朱副官攀談幾句。却又聽得上面已發出一片極重濁的鼾聲。原來那朱副官向裏翻了個身。又呼呼的睡熟了。撇下安玉田冷清清坐在那燭光如豆之下。景象兒好不凄凉慘澹。後來也不知悶坐了多少時候。猛地車身一震。電燈緊跟著大放光明。安玉田暗想。定是火車頭已經接上。葉督軍一會兒就要上車。當不至於再使他感受寂寞了。正忻慰間。果聽得車站上汽車喇叭聲。人們的步履聲。呌喊聲。交響著閙成一片。衝破了原先的寂靜的空氣。不久。這種種聲響更加嘈雜。有一種最尖銳的哨笛聲。從遠處一聲聲接續吹送來。旋又聽得有人在月台上飛步狂奔高聲大嚷道。大帥來啦。</p>

<h3>僞國選少女赴日呈遞國書</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>前日北平電僞國政府，選日滿韓少女五名，本月中旬赴日，呈遞國書，</p>
<p>呈遞國書，亦是國際間一件很重要的事，遞者受者，雙方均有體面關係，今僞國竟選少女五名赴日，呈遞國書，這不是一件希奇而特别的事麽，我因此研究下來，其中確有不少意義，</p>
<p>一、僞滿洲國不是人稱少爺國麽，但是少爺權柄雖小，到底還有些陽性，至於女子，則陽性全無，夫綱獨振，以女子而代表僞滿州國，完全表示日本的「賢母良妻主義」，</p>
<p>一、呈遞國書而用女子，已經奇異，而女子之中，又選日滿韓三國女子，其意若曰，滿洲的女子，等於韓國女子，韓國女子，等於日本女子，就是耶穌敎徒所說，聖母聖子聖靈三位一體之意，</p>
<p>一、旣名曰滿洲國，自應有許多文武百官，足以代表國家，奉膺使命的，必不在少數，今竟不遣一人，而獨遣幾個摩登女子，奉承使節，眞是「滿朝文武多飯桶，博得美人一笑看，」</p>
<p>照以上幾點看來，日人之舞弄僞滿洲國，可謂已極，並且我聞日本對於僞滿洲國的組織，頗有悔意，故昨日報載，滿洲四頭政治統一案，行將通過，果如此，則僞滿洲國一幕俾儡活劇，不久就要「停鑼」了，</p>

<p>科學</p>
<h3>菓子汁取法</h3>
<p>— 槐</p>
<p>菓子汁的用途，除製各種酒外，夏日的欽料如橙汁水，檸檬水，氷淇淋布丁等：都要用菓子汁來作的，菓汁内所含與人身營養有關的成分，除菓糖菓酸及鹽類外，還有一種重要物質，即近年科學廣告中所常見的維他命是也，維他命的存在，以有色鮮菓内爲特多，故菓汁亦是廉價維他命的來源之一，如更進一步從事自製，大則可輓外溢利權，小亦有補家庭經濟，現把菓汁的取法，</p>
<p>介紹出來，</p>
<p>菓汁佳者，顔色鮮美，汁液透明，氣味與生菓無異，欲得佳品，在取出時須特别留意以下諸點：（一）榨取時與煮沸時，嚴忌與鐵器錫器接觸，（二）須在銅器内煑沸，但切不可置銅器内使冷，防菓酸在空氣内與銅起化學作用，能使菓汁色味變壞，（三）煑時，以方至攝氏八卡至百度之間爲度，須立刻去火，</p>
<p>製法先選多汁鮮菓，入麻布袋内，置壓機下，爲防布袋破裂，始宜徐徐壓榨，俟大部菓汁已經流出，再用大壓力榨乾，如此取得的菓汁，内含一種膠狀菓漿Pektin如不設法取出，冷後即凝爲膠狀固體，不適於用，有在此菓汁内加百分之五或八的純酒精，Pektin即成沈澱下沈，然後單取上層清液，或用濾過法將沈澱晳出均可，惜此法所得菓汁，内含少量酒精，顔色氣味均可變壞，只可作製菓子酒之用，此外一法，即藉菓皮上附着的天然酵母的作用，使Pektin變爲沈澱，最易晳出，法取壓出菓汁，再加入一百分一或二的精製曰糖，入大玻瓶或罐内，不可注滿，以全容量三分二爲度，再用木拴緊閉瓶口，栓上揷一玻管，管的下端不宜浸入菓汁内，上端，向下彎曲，浸入一杯水内靜置室中，室内温度至高不能過攝氏二十或二十五度，一二日後，菓汁發生炭酸氣泡，經玻管導入水杯内洩出，數日後發酵告終，炭酸氣泡亦止，速將上層清液傾出，下層用濾器濾過，即成鮮菓汁，如欲長時間的保存，則須用銅鍋加熱，至八十或百度，乘其未冷時即入瓶内封固，可保年餘不變色味，如專爲飲料之用，則須於未加熱前，加入同重量的精製白糖於内，煑至津騰，立即除去泡膜，入瓶固封待用，</p>

<h3>靠此營生</h3>
<p>— 王士本</p>
<p>「啊唷哀哀哀，槍斃的强盜啊，浮」屍啊，你眞夠要我命了，什麽這樣的狼心，把我辛辛苦苦做下的錢，一起拿去，呌我明天把什麽活命呢丨哀哀哀，」在蒲石路的西端，沿馬路邊停靠一副臭豆腐乾担子，旁邊站立一個衣服不齊面目粗黧的人，眼滬汪汪地發出這樣連哭帶駡的悲聲，</p>
<p>在這種聲音播洩不到十分鐘，已引動馬路上往來的行人，一時擠攏來倒有二三十人，這時人羣中有一位工人式的男子，向那哭的人問道，「你的錢怎樣被人偷去的，有多少呢」</p>
<p>不暪諸位先生說，方纔有一個小伙子，來交易我的生意，以我的碗不乾凈，呌我到對面自來水上去洗洗，我一時受騙，掮了他的木梢，等到洗好回來，人已不見，後來看看鍋子旁的錢筒，已經不見了，我一天生意，兩塊多錢，都在裏面，現在偷去了，呌我一家五口，怎麽活命啊，」這位賣豆腐乾的：從頭劃一地告訴觀衆，說畢，嚎啕大哭起來，</p>
<p>先前問的朋友，聽了他的報告，即在袋裏掏出兩個雙毫給他，並且忠告他，下次留意，在這小販接受他的銀幣和忠告時，只見他掉轉身來，向觀衆說</p>
<p>上海的人眞壞，像這樣苦的小販子，也要想頭他，我也是一個工人，見他這般可憐，那不救濟呢，請諸位也帮帮他的忙，給他凑集兩塊錢，使他明天仍好做生意，這種好事，比燒香還有益哩，」</p>
<p>觀笔們聽了他一番言語，覺得有些道理，并且他自己已做了發起人，首先解囊，再看看這小販，面部現在萬分可憐的悲慘狀態，仍在厲害地哭着，於是不約而同的表示同情，你一毛，他二毛，不到十分鐘，已全數告成，這小販接受了觀衆的救濟金，連連道謝，揩乾眼涙，挑上担子去了，</p>
<p>在觀衆散去的時候，馬路旁一爿烟紙店，有人在裏面說「唉丨今天這齣雙簧，苗頭倒不歹，比昨天好起有一倍啦，」</p>

<h3>窮話速記</h3>
<p>— 張彰</p>
<p>「阿大的爺，明天的米都没有了，柴·鹽·醬·也没有了，家裏的零用錢，只剩三十個銅板，阿大又要吵買···，這種日子，實實難過，你總得想想法子呢？···」一個年約三十來歲的中年婦人對她枕邊的男子說。</p>
<p>「唉，說起來眞苦惱，我有什麽方法可想呢，學校裏的薪水，不但要打六折，」而且還欠我一個半月，問校長去拿，他推說没來領到，問他借呢？也說没有，一般的同事們，也和我一樣地可憐，親戚方面，只有老黄比較富有些，但他也很勢利的啊，我的女人，你看照這樣下去，我們是祇有活活地餓死啊，唉！」一個中年男子，憂愁滿面的也在回答他的妻子。</p>
<p>「隔壁的阿土，雖然是小工，但生活倒很寛裕，家裏終有一樣葷菜吃，而且每月也有一些餘欵，你枉爲是敎書先生，人家說起來，總是先生娘娘，實在我還不如阿土的妻子呢，「想起來，氣也氣死我了···」一位敎書先生的妻子又對她的丈夫說。</p>
<p>「你不要東也憂窮，西也愁苦，我們到底是先生階級，像阿土，雖然會賺錢，但是人家說起來，總是下等人，是小工，體面到底没有我們好，我們雖然現在苦一些，薪水終究拿到着的，你暫時耐耐邑？明天没有用，去揀一二件衣服，去當一當再說，等我拿到薪水，我們一家人快快活活地吃一頓好了，···」一個小學敎員又回答他的夫人道。</p>
<p>「啊！罷了，你總是這樣說，上次他也不是對我這樣說的嗎，已經一個月了，仍也祇拿五隻大洋回來，當衣服有什麽衣服可當，當當也要當完的，嫁你這種丈夫，不氣死也要餓死了，唉，命該如此，我有什麽可說呢·」他的夫人對他丈夫憤憤地說。</p>
<p>「唉！」男子祗管歎氣，一聲也不響。</p>
<p>前面的一段話，是我的一位朋友告訴我的，因爲他的家裏，隔壁住的，是一位小學敎師，和他的妻子三人；據他說，他們時常如此的，尤以滬難發生以後爲最甚，現在房租也有兩個月不付了，看上去的確很可憐呢？</p>
<p>我聽了他的話以後，立刻速記下來，當我在作稿的時候，嘴裏不禁嘆道。</p>
<p>「階級害人，先生害人，」這二個牢騷話。</p>
<p>生意画孔</p>
<h3>銀行中</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>我生平最怕走進當舖和銀行，因爲它們常會給我以極大的奚落。但是昨天爲了去兌一張支票，終於又得跨進那高大的門檻。</p>
<p>當我憂懼的找到了支取處，那裏已有一個比我理蹩脚的小伙子站在那兒，手裏緊揑着支票向着「銅檻」内的人凝視着，帶着和善的請求的眼光。於是我也拿出支票站在那人的旁邊，謹愼的不敢發出聲響。但是我却看見就在我面前的銀行員仍在翻着簿子，並且在上面寫着外國字，他小心於自己的工作，完全没有注意到我們在聽候他的發落。於是我的心情焦急，但是我也不敢焦急。其後那小伙子始終抖着喉音說：</p>
<p>『先生！對不住。』</p>
<p>『········』可是那位先生連眼也不睬，没有回答。</p>
<p>『先生！我眞等得太久了。』又是他說，似乎有點兒耐不住火性似的。於是那先生更狠狠地說：</p>
<p>『急什麽呢？』</p>
<p>『啊！急什麽呢！』多麽權威啊！』我想。憂懼和憤怒同時逼上心頭。當然那人也不敢再說什麽了。</p>
<p>其後是一陣皮鞋的脚步聲在我們的身後停住，接上是一高大的外國人擠了進來，於是我連忙讓開，只聽得那洋紳士說了一聲；</p>
<p>「哈羅，Please」立刻那位先生便應着，</p>
<p>「Yes丨」立刻走了過來。</p>
<p>約莫五分鐘的光景，那位洋先生便拿一大疊的鈔票挺着胸膛走出去了。</p>
<p>這時候那位先生將我們都看了一眼，好像是要在我們身上找出什麽不同之處來，於是僥倖得很，我的支票被奪去了。</p>
<p>幾分鐘後，當我退去的時候，我覺得對於那比我更蹩脚的人確有無限的歉意。</p>
<p>走出銀行，雖然是悶熱的空氣亦覺得格外宜人，於是我深深　地吸了一口氣。</p>

<h3>After Hériot Forms the French Cabinet</h3>
<p>By Han</p>
<p>With the recent victory of the Left in the French elections, Édouard Hériot has proceeded to form a cabinet, and his grand pronouncements have already been made clear to us. The changes in representative political life often shift with the times and circumstances. Recently, the international situation has become increasingly urgent, and the economic panic is worsening. On the eastern bank of the Rhine, Hitler's extreme forces are poised with swords drawn, aggressively pressing forward. Yet, on the western bank, there is unprecedented calm and quiet. Even after the incident involving President Doumer, the electoral order remained extremely stable and was not affected in the slightest. Comparing the results of the elections in Germany and France, Germany leans to the right, while France leans to the left. The divergent political trends of Germany and France are particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Does the Radical Socialist Party led by Hériot truly embrace socialism as its platform? Is the division between left and right in French political parties truly a chasm between socialism and anti-socialism? These two questions must be resolved to understand French politics. In reality, the division between left and right in French political parties can no longer be defined by theory; it must be judged based on facts. On the French political stage, the rhetoric of the left-leaning parties has become familiar to the right-wing as well, who imitate it to the fullest extent, vividly and meticulously. All the stimulating and sharp terms of praise associated with the left are no longer exclusive to those who call themselves left-leaning. Therefore, the so-called left and right leaning in France can no longer be distinguished solely by rhetoric. Hériot himself, of course, identifies as left-leaning. However, in his campaign speeches, he solemnly declared, "We are not revolutionaries, but we will never lose our social and national character." Thus, Hériot's left-leaning is a non-revolutionary left-leaning. The socialism he once held as a classic has long been shelved. Recently, public opinion in the vicinity of Lake Biwa described the French left and right as follows: large landowners are right, small landowners are left; large enterprises are right, small industries are left; large capitalists are right, small capitalists are left; the size of the bourgeoisie is the standard for left and right. Such a definition of left and right is laughable. We previously speculated that Hériot would inevitably emerge to form a cabinet after this French election, and that its color would be neither left nor right. Judging from the current facts, our assessment is not far off. The Radical Socialist Party led by Hériot consulted with the Socialist Party led by Léon Blum on cooperation. The Socialist Party proposed a minimum platform as a condition for cooperation, such as actively pursuing disarmament, strictly supervising banks, promoting social insurance, nationalizing railways, and implementing a forty-hour work week. Hériot sternly rejected these proposals. Thus, Hériot's political views are incompatible with socialism, and his left-leaning tendencies are limited.</p>
<p>Based on the above observations, we dare to assert that French politics after Hériot forms his cabinet will continue the policies passed down from Poincaré, Barthou, and Tardieu, with the addition of a layer of "peace protection." According to recent telegrams, France is still unwilling to make any concessions on the reparations issue, and Hériot's new cabinet declaration still maintains the Paris Peace Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, the Locarno Security Pact, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact as the foundation of European peace. The resolution of reparations and war debts is predicated on not harming French interests, and the implementation of international disarmament is proportional to the level of security. Thus, his so-called left-wing platform is not much different from the right-wing governments led by Tardieu and Laval.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the modern French political stage consistently maintains old plots, arranges old scenery, and merely replaces them with new actors. If France's policies remain unchanged, Germany's crisis will not be resolved, and may even help to increase Hitler's power and exacerbate conflicts between imperialist powers. As we look at our nation's ongoing difficulties and the world's unrest, we cannot help but feel anxious.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Five Nations Secretly Discuss Shanghai Issue</h3>
<p>Four Ambassadors Visit Japanese Prime Minister Saitō</p>
<p>Express Opinions on Yoshizawa's Suggestions</p>
<p>Talk of a "Free City" Becomes More Apparent</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saitō spoke tonight with the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy in his capacity as Foreign Minister. The content of the discussion has not been disclosed, but it is believed that the four ambassadors explained the attitudes of their respective governments towards the suggestions made by former Foreign Minister Yoshizawa on May 13th. These suggestions have not been formally published. It is rumored that Yoshizawa suggested turning Shanghai into a demilitarized zone or an international free city within it. The Foreign Ministry has neither confirmed nor denied this information, leading many to believe it is true. It is now known that Yoshizawa proposed a plan to hold a roundtable conference as soon as possible to seek a permanent solution to Shanghai's security. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Causes Major Concerns in British Newspapers</h3>
<p>London The secret discussions in Tokyo regarding a roundtable conference on China have caused significant concerns in the Manchester Guardian. Today, the newspaper published an editorial urging the public to pay attention to "a small matter" whose significance should not be overshadowed by various future meetings elsewhere. The editorial stated that it is "odious" to hear that an aggressor is engaged in secret discussions with particularly relevant powers, with the intention of predetermining demands on China. Although this action is in line with the League of Nations and the powers' handling of the Sino-Japanese dispute from the beginning, it is absolutely unjust. The newspaper further stated that Japan, through its policy of aggression and treaty destruction, is now being allowed to extort concessions from China, which is incomprehensible. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Contents of Talks Kept Strictly Secret</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The ambassadors of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy to Japan visited Saitō, who also serves as Foreign Minister, together this afternoon at 6:00 PM. The four ambassadors expressed their governments' opinions on Foreign Minister Yoshizawa's proposal to hold a preliminary meeting for the Shanghai roundtable conference in Tokyo. They left after a thirty-minute meeting. The contents of the four governments' responses are being kept strictly secret. There is no objection in principle to promoting the opening of the roundtable conference, and it is generally supported. However, it seems that Japan has not received a satisfactory response regarding the holding of a preliminary meeting in Tokyo. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>British Parliamentarians Question in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London During today's session of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Hall Caine asked the Foreign Secretary whether he had considered the request from the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai to convene a roundtable conference to resolve outstanding issues, given the risk of a recurrence of the events of 1927 and 1931. What actions will the Foreign Secretary take to promote the conference? Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden replied that Foreign Secretary Simon had not yet received this information. As for the roundtable conference, it is still under secret discussion. Another Conservative MP asked whether the Foreign Secretary would consider the Lytton Report as the basis for a roundtable conference and use it to achieve a statesmanlike solution, treating both Chinese and foreigners with impartiality. Eden replied that this issue is still under secret discussion, so he could not provide any information. However, he assured that all relevant facts would be considered. A Labour MP suggested sending another commission to Manchuria to investigate. Eden disagreed, stating that sending a commission to observe the ongoing war in Manchuria in the hope of benefiting the League of Nations would be futile, and that the Lytton Commission had recently concluded its investigation. Eden also announced that Foreign Secretary Simon had received a report that Japanese authorities in Dalian were preventing goods from entering Manchuria. The British Ambassador to Tokyo had been instructed by the Foreign Office to negotiate with the Japanese government, and assurances had been received that this measure would not be implemented immediately. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Investigation Team Leaves Beiping</p>
<h3>Going to Qingdao for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The members of the investigation team, Lytton, as well as German and Italian representatives and attendants, Mr. Hsu, and others, and our representatives, Gu, Liu, Yan, etc., and Japanese representatives, Yoshida, Hayashi, Ide, etc., left Beiping at 6:00 PM this evening for inspection in Qingdao. Wang Fengrui, chief of the traffic department of the Beining Railway, and Zhou Songxian, section chief, accompanied them. The reception office telegraphed Han Fuju and Shen Honglie, requesting them to provide appropriate protection at that time. Fei Lete, Deputy Secretary-General of the Investigation Team, and attendants Dunning and Liddofman, etc., arrived in Beiping from Dalian this morning and immediately visited Lytton to report on the situation along the way. (Exclusive dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When Lytton and others left Beiping at 6:00 PM this evening, those who came to the station to see them off included Zhu Guangmu, Haas, and Wang Chengchuan, etc. The German and Italian representatives went to the German and Italian embassies this morning to bid farewell.

<h3>Gu Weijun Discusses the Current Situation in Northeast China</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A Reuters correspondent paid a special visit to Dr. Gu Weijun today. According to his description of the current situation in Manchuria, it is extremely alarming. Gu stated that Japan's large-scale military operations are actually aimed at annexing Manchuria, and this is clearly evident everywhere in Manchuria. Chinese in Manchuria have been forced and coerced into serving Japan. The current situation is like setting fire to a pile of firewood, so the future of East Asia is fraught with hidden dangers. Gu believes that if a solution is not found quickly based on solemn international treaties and fairness to China, there will soon be an explosion. The repercussions of this explosion will not only shake and harm the peace of the Far East and the Pacific, but may also spread to the whole world. Today, no one can avoid the impact of war simply because of distance. Once a war breaks out, it will spread throughout the world. Gu continued that what he saw and heard during his trip to Manchuria made him extremely worried about the future of peace. The Manchurian problem has proven to be related to the survival of China and to international affairs. The prosperity and peace of the world depend on this. Only a fair, prompt, and concerted action by the relevant powers can save Manchuria from dangerous development. When asked about the obstruction of the work of the League of Nations investigation team, Gu replied that he was unable to fulfill his responsibilities as a Chinese attendant and contribute the necessary assistance to the investigation team due to the restrictions imposed by the Manchurian authorities. These restrictions were imposed in various ways, such as closely monitoring his actions and those of the Chinese delegation. Even when the investigation team was delineating its responsibilities, it often encountered major difficulties. Gu emphasized that the members of the investigation team acted with sincerity and impartiality, seeking only to be factual and objective, which he and all the Chinese admired. As for the results of the investigation team, although a great deal of information was collected from the Chinese side, the collection of information was greatly hampered because the Chinese attendants and the Chinese delegation were subject to various restrictions, so that they could not meet the witnesses whom the Chinese delegation wanted to send to the investigation team, and the results obtained were not as numerous as expected. When asked about his mission to France, Gu said that he was very willing to go to Paris, but because of his duties here, it was difficult to complete them for the time being, so he did not know when he would be able to make the trip. Before making a decision, he wanted to consult with the leaders of the National Government. Gu also confirmed that he would be traveling to Qingdao with Lord Lytton, Italian and German investigators, and Japanese attendants this evening, saying that this trip was to allow the investigators to decide on the location for compiling the final report. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Location for Compilation of Report</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Qingdao, the locations considered for the compilation of the investigation team's report are Beidaihe, Weihaiwei, and Qingdao. Weihaiwei has been eliminated due to transportation, communication, and other factors. Beidaihe is strongly desired by Zhang Xueliang, and may be selected. However, although Lord Lytton seemed moved for a time, a commissioner from a certain country raised an objection, arguing that it would be inappropriate for the investigation team to accept a location chosen by Zhang Xueliang, who has a direct interest in the investigation. Therefore, Lord Lytton is inspecting whether Qingdao is suitable in order to reject Zhang Xueliang's request and maintain his own credibility. According to local sources, the choice of location for the compilation of the report seems to have been decided in fact to be Qingdao. (Electric News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Travel Itinerary of Lytton and His Entourage</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Qingdao, Lytton and his entourage, whose purpose is to inspect Qingdao, are scheduled to depart from Beiping on a special train of the Jinpu Railway at 6:00 PM on the 8th, arrive in Jinan at 9:15 AM on the 9th, and depart from Jinan on a special train of the Jiaoji Railway at 10:45 AM on the same morning, arriving in Qingdao at 9:00 PM on the same night. They will stay in the local area that night and inspect the city on the 10th, returning to Beiping that night. Depending on the situation, they may depart on the morning of the 11th. As for the accommodations for the entourage in the local area, the Chinese side proposes to provide the mayor's official residence and the International Sanatorium for the commissioners below Lord Lytton, as well as the third country side and the Chinese entourage, except for the Japanese attendants and attendants. However, the Japanese side believes that Lord Lytton may reject the Chinese's intention, and it is not known. Therefore, in order to prepare for any eventuality, all the rooms in the Grand Hotel have been reserved for the entourage. (Electric News Agency, 8th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Absolutely Denies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after Japan occupied Northeast China, it repeatedly instigated traitors to destroy our administrative sovereignty and establish various illegal organizations.

<p>French Chamber of Deputies Supports New Government by a Vote of 390 to 152</p>
<p>Herriot's Policy Declaration Uses Moderate Language to Please All Factions</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 7th. Today, the French Chamber of Deputies voted 390 to 152 to express confidence in the Herriot Cabinet, passing the new cabinet's policy declaration. Sixty deputies abstained from voting. This expression is sufficient to greatly increase the strength of the new cabinet and can be regarded as an endorsement of Herriot's foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Fewer Affirmative Votes Than Expected</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th. Herriot's speech in the Chamber of Deputies today on international peace and goodwill received affirmative votes, but the number of votes was less than expected. After listening to the new Prime Minister's speech, 390 deputies voted in favor, 152 voted against, and 50 abstained. Herriot's speech was intended to please both the left and right wings, and it was expected to receive unanimous approval, but the number of those who voted against was surprisingly high. The Socialists voted in favor, but their leader, Blum, solemnly stated that this vote of confidence should not be interpreted as the party's willingness to provide unconditional support to the new government. Herriot immediately replied that he could not allow the Socialist Party's vote to affect his freedom. Those who voted for the government were the Radical Socialists to which Herriot belonged, the left wing of the Radical Party, the Central Party, and the Socialists. The new Prime Minister's speech did not clarify the European situation. His discussion focused on peace and goodwill. The new Prime Minister spoke of world disarmament and the reparations issue, repeatedly emphasizing France's security, but with a sincere expression of immediately reducing France's military budget.</p>
<h3>Disputes Among Factions in Parliament</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 7th. Today was the first important meeting of the French 15th Congress. For several days, it has been impossible for bystanders to obtain admission tickets. Therefore, before the meeting, hundreds of people lined up in front of the Chamber of Deputies, hoping to enter temporarily.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Those who were allowed to enter were no less than several hundred people, but in the end, they were all disappointed. At 2:45 PM, the gallery was already overcrowded. Diplomatic personnel and deputies waited until the last few minutes before the meeting to enter the chamber and take their seats. At 3:00 PM, the Speaker ascended the podium, and the entire chamber applauded. After a while, the new cabinet entered and took their seats in the government seats in order. Former Prime Minister Tardieu sat in the middle on the right side, shaking hands and exchanging greetings with many people. At 3:10 PM, the Speaker rang the bell to start the meeting, and the entire chamber was silent. Speaker Pu Yison stood up and gave a speech, first paying tribute to the deceased former deputies and praising the character of the deceased President Doumer. He said that at this time of world panic, the task of the current deputies is extremely important, but they must work hard and not be pessimistic. The Speaker also praised the parliamentary cabinet system, saying that it is flexible and can cope with various difficulties. As for France's love of peace, it can be seen in the last election. Pu's speech was very well received by the meeting. When he mentioned Briand and Doumer, the applause was endless. When praising President Doumer, the entire chamber, except for the Communist Party, stood up to pay their respects. After the Speaker finished his speech, he asked the new Prime Minister, Herriot, to read the President's message to the parliament. The audience listened attentively. After the message was read, Herriot immediately read the cabinet's declaration. Although there were Communist deputies who attempted to disrupt, the entire Chamber paid close attention to Herriot's declaration. When he mentioned the necessity of international cooperation, there was thunderous applause. Regarding the compensation issue, all factions on the left, right, and center applauded in unison. Herriot also said, "Civilized nations will place war outside the law." As soon as this was said, Tardieu applauded first, and applause erupted throughout the chamber one after another. Finally, when Herriot requested the parliament's confidence, the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Central Party applauded in unison. A little later, the parliament requested that the imprisoned Communist deputy, Ramand, be released. The Speaker also presented and read out the various requests to question the government's major policies. The Prime Minister acknowledged that the debate would begin immediately. The first to question was Bosson, a deputy of the Republican Democratic Union, who said that the cabinet's policies were still insufficient in terms of the economy. He hoped that the government could make the prediction that "France will have a day to announce world peace" come true. The parliament then adjourned at 4:30 PM and reconvened at 4:45 PM. Peng Gu and Le Lou returned from attending the Senate and took their seats in the government seats. Communist deputy Taoli Ao raised questions about social policy, demanding that the government adopt a 40-hour work week and a 7-hour workday. He blamed the Socialist Party for abandoning its party platform and cooperating with the Radical Party government. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party then had a dispute. Taoli Ao finished his speech amidst the clamor. Then, Walde, a deputy from the Lower Rhine region, spoke, saying that the party should deal with Hitlerism with a vigorous policy and demand that the government</p>
<p>Should use strong means to relieve unemployment. Communist deputy Banli criticized the government's foreign policy, saying that its attitude towards the Far East incident was inappropriate, and especially criticized its attitude towards the Harbin incident. Herriot replied that France had not yet decided what steps to take on the Far East issue. Former Aviation Minister Ainake firmly stated that the left-wing radical system would support the government. Socialist leader Blum said that the Socialist Party had decided to express its confidence in the government and emphasized that this victory of the left was of great importance. The left, in any case, will take advantage of this victory. Blum also said that the more consolidated France's democracy becomes, the more guaranteed world peace will be. Finally, he said that if the government's actions can demonstrate the victory of the left, the Socialist Party will definitely support it. Then Tardieu took the stage, and the center and right wings applauded enthusiastically, while the extreme left and the Communist Party expressed resistance and made a lot of noise. The Speaker ordered them to observe order. Tardieu said to the left wing, "The number of votes you got in the election increased by 10%, and the number of seats you got increased by 30% due to the left-wing alliance. The Radical Socialist Party has been hesitant between the two extremes since 1919, sometimes voting for its friends and sometimes voting against them. Your success is due to the left-wing alliance." Tardieu was very calm when he spoke. The occasional expression of anger from the left wing was ineffective with a smile. However, Tardieu continued to accuse the Socialist Party, saying that after each time the party came to power, it abandoned its usual military policy, and its financial policy often bankrupted the country. Tardieu said that the politics from 1926 to 1932 was the politics of building peace, such as the Yang Ge Plan and Briand's non-war pact, which are all commendable. Tardieu strongly defended the financial policies of the previous government, and said that he always supported France's advocacy of security arbitration and disarmament. When Tardieu talked about the government alliance, he said that the Socialist Party and the Radical Party only disagreed on the principles of implementation. Finally, he asked the government whether it would continue to support France's advocacy at the Disarmament Conference, and if so, he would ask his friends to vote for a vote of confidence. Herriot took the stage and replied that the various measures regarding foreign policy had been clearly determined in the cabinet declaration, and all the questions asked by Tardieu had also been included. Herriot then replied to the Communist Party's Taoli Ao, saying that he has always been, Herriot continued to reply to Communist Taoli Ao, saying that he has always respected the workers, and France will continue to advocate the policy of reducing working hours in Geneva. As for the issue of foreign policy, Herriot said that in 1924, he supported Briand's policy, and he still adheres to this policy and will never change. Herriot expressed his deep gratitude to the Socialist Party, but also imitated the position of the</p>
<p>Of the Socialist Party and retains its independent status. The two people Herriot and Tardieu replied for a long time. At 8:45 PM, after the request of the majority of the deputies, a temporary break was taken. At 8:55 PM, the meeting was reopened. Tardieu spoke again from his seat, causing protests from the Socialist Party. The Communist Party declared that the party would vote against the government. The meeting was then adjourned. The Speaker then put the following motion to a vote, that is, "After the House of Representatives respectfully listens to the government's declaration, it is willing to trust the government so that it can implement politics in accordance with the majority opinion recently expressed by the people." As a result, the government obtained the confidence of the parliament with a majority of 390 votes against 152 votes.</p>
<h3>Tardieu Wants to Resign as Party Leader</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 8th. Last night, the French Prime Minister Herriot won more votes of confidence in the House than were reported last night. Only 115 voted against, which shows that although Tardieu opposed the government, a large portion of the Republican Left deputies to which he belonged either voted in favor or abstained from voting. It is said that Tardieu is quite angry about the abolition of party discipline because of this, and is planning to resign as party leader. However, the French newspapers are not as enthusiastic about the government's major policy declaration as the parliament's support. However, among them, with regard to the issue of diplomacy, except for a few who pointed out that it was too cautious, the rest expressed their support.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Arguments of British and German Newspapers</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 8th. To date, German newspapers have mostly commented on the French new government's major policy declaration only in the headlines, saying that there are no new plans in it, and that most of the discussions are abstract, and there is no concrete solution to the urgent issues of the present time. The German World Newspaper has a more hopeful view, saying that Herriot is prepared to reluctantly accept some of Germany's claims on the issue of reparations.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 8th. This morning, British newspapers generally believe that Herriot's major policy declaration is sufficient to increase the hope for the success of the Lausanne Conference. Even the Times and the Daily Telegraph, although they claim that Herriot's policy differs from that of the previous cabinet mostly in tone, and there are few changes in principle, they also believe that the near future has more hope.</p>
<h3>The Result of the Radical Party Re-election</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 8th. After Herriot resigned as Chairman of the French Radical Socialist Party because of his cabinet formation, the result of the re-election last night was that Yaer Bei was elected Chairman and Pang Na was elected Vice Chairman. Both of them are left-wing members of the party and are known as provincial strongmen.</p>
<p>Disarmament Conference</p>
<h3>Air Force Committee Ends in Discord</h3>
<p>Subcommittee Recommendation Included in the Report</p>
<p>Representatives from Italy, Russia, and Germany Leave in Protest</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 7th. Today, the Air Force Committee of the Disarmament Conference ended in discord. Representatives from Italy, Russia, and Germany left in anger, claiming that they would no longer attend the committee meetings. The committee will now reopen tomorrow to draft a report. The reason why Italy, Russia, and Germany protested was because the committee decided to include certain answers in the report regarding the questions raised by France, in accordance with the recommendations of the subcommittee. During the discussion, the Italian representative argued that the answers recommended by the subcommittee would create an absolutely misleading impression on the conditions of the air force equipment. The German and Russian representatives supported the Italian claim, but as a result of the vote, it was still decided by twenty-three votes to eleven votes to include the subcommittee's recommendations in the report. China and Italy, Russia, Germany and other countries also voted against. After the voting results were announced, the representatives of the three countries immediately withdrew from the meeting place along with the protesters.</p>
<p>German Government</p>
<h3>Will Issue New Emergency Decree</h3>
<p>On the Unemployment Relief System</p>
<p>There Will Be Severe Modifications</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th. Today, it was confirmed from official sources that the German government intends to revoke the order to dissolve the National Socialist Party Assault Troopers (i.e., the Brownshirts). However, it is said that this move is not to restore the old situation. The team will be subject to the government's strictest supervision together with other semi-military agencies. As for the new order to lift the ban, it may be combined in the new emergency order. This new emergency order is being prepared by the government and is expected to be published within this week. The cabinet met twice today for this purpose, hoping to immediately implement several of the government's important goals. It is reported that in the new decree, there will be severe modifications to the unemployment relief system in order to reduce national treasury expenditures. However, it is expected that this move will cause strong protests from workers, which will make the political situation even more tense, and will have a major impact on the new elections. However, it is heard that the government has made up its mind that if it fails to form a majority government after the new election, it will decide to dissolve and re-elect.</p>
<p>Papen Prepares</p>
<h3>To Attend the Lausanne Conference</h3>
<p>As Leader of the German Delegation</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th. Today, semi-official news reported that German Chancellor Papen will personally lead the German delegation to the Lausanne Conference. However, Papen will hardly be able to stay in Lausanne for a long time. During his absence, Foreign Minister Baron Neurath will be the chief representative of the delegation. In addition, Finance Minister Count Kroesigk, Economics Minister Professor Warmbold, and External Deputy Minister Dr. Puhl, etc., will all attend. If financial issues in Germany are discussed at the meeting, Dr. Luther, President of the Deutsche Bank, will also attend.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 8th. The German delegation participating in the Lausanne reparations conference next Tuesday will be composed of Foreign Minister Nielaiser, Finance Minister Kroesigk, and Economics Minister Warmbold.</p>

<h3>Cuts Army Budget</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 7th. Today, the US Senate Finance Committee, with a straightforward approach, cut 7 million US dollars from the Army Department budget passed by the House of Representatives. However, most of the cuts were for river and harbor improvement expenses. Other motions to economize on military and administrative expenses, such as merging the Navy and Army into a Department of Defense, which is estimated to save 50 million US dollars annually, and canceling the Navy and Army transport ships, which could save 2 million US dollars annually, were not considered.</p>

<p>Japanese Authorities Consider</p>
<h3>Relief Plan for Farmers</h3>
<p>Extension of Loan Repayment Period by One Year</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: The hardship and unrest of farmers remain the focus of public attention. The authorities are currently considering a relief plan. However, the proposal to suspend farmers' debts, which amount to approximately 600 million yuan, has been widely criticized, as this move would strike a blow to the current capital and economic system and lead farmers and industrialists to ruin together. The proposed amendment to the tax regulations, especially the increase in certain tax rates, is also opposed. It is generally believed that it is questionable whether it is worthwhile to continue to provide protection in the current state of industry. It should be noted that the current hardship of farmers is largely due to sacrificing their interests to subsidize and protect urban industries. Mitsui Company now acknowledges the urgency of relieving farmers and has donated 3 million yuan for relief as a public initiative.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, led by Minister Goto, Vice-Ministers Ishiguro and Arima, and other relevant officials, gathered last night to discuss emergency relief measures for rural villages. The meeting continued until late at night and it is said that a debt reduction policy has been decided, with the following guidelines: of the low-interest funds related to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry loaned to rural villages by the Deposit Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, which amount to 400 million yuan, approximately 80 million yuan is due to be repaid in August and September. It has now been decided to extend the repayment period by one year. At the same time, negotiations will be conducted with the Ministry of Finance to appropriately extend the repayment period for all low-interest funds loaned to farmers by the government. Furthermore, in order to provide emergency assistance to impoverished farmers, it is planned to sell government-owned rice at low prices, within the scope permitted by regulations, with deferred payment. However, this matter is still under consideration.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: The Seiyukai held an emergency executive meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures for rural villages. All agreed that reducing the currency value was the most effective method. However, regarding whether to amend the currency law to reduce the currency value or to lift the gold embargo at the new currency value, opinions were divided and no consensus was reached. As a result, a small committee was selected to create a basic proposal for emergency rural relief measures, and the meeting adjourned. Ten committee members gathered in the Diet this morning to create a concrete proposal.</p>
<h3>Chilean President Montero Resigns</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 8th Dispatch: Since the revolution in Chile, various telegrams have reported conflicting information about the whereabouts of President Montero. The Chilean Minister here has recently received an official telegram from Santiago stating that President Montero has indeed resigned and that his government has been taken over by a revolutionary committee.</p>

<h3>Unemployment Relief Plan</h3>
<p>Appropriation of 2.3 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>For Unemployment Relief Expenses</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th Dispatch: The unemployment relief bill previously proposed by Representative Garner, advocating the appropriation of 2.3 billion yuan for relief expenses, was referred to the Finance Committee for review. President Hoover and the Secretary of the Treasury were strongly opposed, but the Finance Committee ultimately reported the bill on June 3, agreeing to it. Now this bill has been passed by the House of Representatives and sent to the Senate.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 7th Dispatch: U.S. President Hoover's relief plan was rejected by the House of Representatives today by a vote of 218 to 183.

The content of the plan is to raise 2 billion yuan to construct public works, with each person working five days a week, in order to reduce unemployment. It is expected that the Senate will strongly oppose it. Today, the Senate voted 63 to 14 to reject a motion to reduce the budget for expenses for veterans and their families by 48 million yuan from the originally listed 98 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The Impact of the Bank of Japan's Interest Rate Cut</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: The Bank of Japan reduced the official interest rate across the board by two tenths of a sen from today, as reported in yesterday's telegram. Regarding its impact on the industrial world, under normal circumstances, lowering the interest rate today, when tariff increases have been confirmed, should invigorate the business world. However, in today's global recession, with declining exports and falling prices of various goods, people dare not operate businesses with peace of mind. According to general observation, it is feared that the effect of this interest rate cut will not be apparent.</p>
<h3>Unexpected Death of Diplomat Bordonaro</h3>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>On the Way to Pingyu</h3>
<p>The Inspection Group Passes Through Shanhaiguan and Visits Beidaihe</p>
<p>Representative Gu Talks About His Impressions of the Northeast</p>
<p>Returning to Beiping at 9:00 PM on the 5th</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Wang Guangqi, Secretary-General of the Chinese Delegation, received a telegram from Shenyang informing him that the League of Nations Investigation Commission would enter Shanhaiguan on June 4. At the same time, he received telegrams from Premier Wang Zhaoming of the Executive Yuan, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission, ordering the delegation to go to Shanhaiguan to welcome the members of the Commission and Representative Gu Weijun and to express their condolences. Therefore, on the evening of the 3rd, at 8:00 PM, he took the night train on the Beining Railway to Yu. Those who went with him included Zhu Guangmu, Director of the General Affairs Office of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, representing Zhang Xueliang; Cai Yuan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Beiping Municipal Government, representing the Beiping Municipal Government; Ning Xiang, Director of the Reception Department of the Beiping Reception Committee for the League of Nations Investigation Commission; Yan Deqing, Director of the South Jiaoji Railway Management Committee; Liu Naifan, Chief of the Protocol Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Madam Huang Huilan, wife of Gu Weijun, with her sons Yu Chang and Fu Chang, and her nephew Shan Chang. Also, four dogs were brought along on a separate car. In addition, Zhang Xueliang sent Advisor Zhang Weibin with forty guards from the Beiping Pacification Headquarters to escort the League of Nations Investigation Commission's special train. There were also several reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers and news agencies in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai. The number of vehicles could not be increased temporarily, resulting in extreme crowding. There were no vacant seats on the dining car, and some had to sit up all night. As it was approaching summer, many people were going to Beidaihe to escape the heat. The train arrived in Beidaihe the next morning. Zhu Guangmu, Cai Yuan, and Ning Xiang disembarked to arrange everything, as the Investigation Commission intended to stay there to escape the heat and prepare reports. Wang Guangqi and others continued to advance. They then learned that the Investigation Commission's special train was stopped at Qinhuangdao, so they disembarked there. Madam Gu's car was also unloaded. Initially, it was planned to attach it to the rear of the special train, but the special train had a car reserved for Secretary-General Haas, who had already gone to Ping. Therefore, it was provided for Madam Gu to ride in. Madam Gu very much wanted to visit the Great Wall, and instructed the special train to leave early. Later, upon hearing that the Japanese had made various arrangements there, she abandoned the idea. The people on the train had nothing to do, so many went to the beach to swim or visit the Kailuan Mining Bureau. In the afternoon, Cai Yuan and Ning Xiang arrived from Beidaihe by rickshaw. The reporters from various newspapers and news agencies, unable to work in Qinhuangdao, planned to take the slow train at 2:00 PM to Shanhaiguan first, but at that time, a heavy rain suddenly poured down, so they had to stop.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Investigation Commission Arrives in Ping (1)</h3>
<p>The Investigation Commission's train arrived in Qinhuangdao from Tangchang on the 2nd. This train was the one used by the Investigation Commission last time, so the arrangements were exactly the same as last time. In the afternoon, at 4:00 PM, it left for Shanhaiguan. It first stopped at the north platform of the station, and then moved to the south platform. Wang Fengrui, Director of Transportation of the Beining Railway, directed everything.</p>
<p>The Shanhaiguan Railway Station was decorated with national flags and welcome banners in English. A colorful welcoming archway from all sectors of Lin Yu County was built on the south platform, creating a completely new atmosphere. Reporters disembarked to inspect the station and saw that the buildings to the west of the station had been forcibly converted by the Japanese into the ticket office and stationmaster's office of the Fengshan Railway Bureau, but the doors and windows were closed, with only a guard stationed next to the wooden fence. Various new regulations were posted outside the window, the most noteworthy of which was that tickets must be purchased here. The first-class women's waiting room on the south platform had been converted into the Fengshan Railway Bureau's Traffic Section and Liaison Office, and the men's waiting room also sold wine and other beverages. A five-colored flag was openly hung on the pole outside the building. When asked about this by station staff, it was said to be a new invention. Reporters also visited outside the station and learned that the so-called "Manchukuo" international police had been temporarily hidden to avoid the eyes of the Investigation Commission and replaced by plainclothes detectives. At 6:40 PM, the rain stopped and a rainbow appeared. The Japanese escort car had entered the platform. The car was painted with yellow and green patterns, intended to confuse the enemy's sight during wartime. The car was full of Japanese soldiers, two female secretaries from the Japanese Delegation, and photographic reporters from Japanese newspapers. At 7:00 PM, the Investigation Commission's special train arrived. The five-colored flag was flying at the head of the train. Brigade Commander He Zhuguo led a platoon of troops to welcome them, along with more than ten members of the Tian Family Elementary School children's corps. At this time, Japanese military officers also gathered, and Japanese soldiers patrolled the platform to help maintain order. The special train stopped amidst the sounds of military music. The commissioners and Representative Gu, Counselor Liu Chongjie, Secretary Xiao Jirong, Secretary Shi Zhaokui, and others got off in turn, all first shaking hands with Madam Gu as a courtesy. At that moment, the photographic reporters surrounded Madam Gu. Representatives from all sectors of Lin Yu County especially paid respects to Representative Gu, expressing their respect for his hard work and bearing the burden of humiliation on this trip. After the luggage was unloaded, they transferred to a special train on the Beining Railway and departed at 7:30 PM, arriving at Qinhuangdao at 8:10 PM. Initially, it was planned to stay here overnight, but fearing inconvenience in protection, they reopened to the Beidaihe beach. The station also had a colorful archway, and the red lights illuminated the green trees along the way, which was quite pleasing to the eye. Zhu Guangmu was the first to board the train and discuss the next morning's tour schedule and other matters with Representative Gu. It rained heavily at night, but the air was cool and everyone slept peacefully.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Investigation Commission Arrives in Ping (2)</h3>
<p>Representative Gu, in the midst of his busy schedule, met with reporters from newspapers and news agencies in Ping, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and answered their questions. He said that he had participated in the Investigation Commission and had gone to Shenyang, Jilin, Harbin, Dalian, Lushun, Anshan, and other places. From Anshan, he returned to Shenyang and then went to Fushun. Today, he entered Shanhaiguan. The places the train passed through were Huanggu Tun, Goubangzi, Jinzhou, Xingcheng, Suizhong, and Qiansuo. He only disembarked in Jinzhou to inspect, staying for about an hour. He did not want to say much about this trip. What he could say was that everyone felt uncomfortable wherever they went and saw heartbreaking scenes. The Northeast is as large as the eight or nine coastal provinces and is comparable to the combined area of Germany and France. It is truly a beautiful land and a natural treasure. However, now 30 million compatriots are suffering the pain of national subjugation. After this incident, the people of the country should always keep the Northeast in mind and never forget the hope of 30 million compatriots for salvation. We must have a long-term perspective. Personal problems are small.</p>
<p>If there is no solution externally, we will all perish together. The Chinese often say that our country is vast and populous, so how could we be subjugated? But one look at the Northeast and you know that it is not true. There are only 50,000 Japanese soldiers in the Northeast, and 30 million people can do nothing. Compatriots want to complain to us, but they dare not because the Japanese are watching very closely. Those who come will be arrested. There is no way to appeal, and it is unbearable to talk about. But one thing is worth noting: many petitions have been received, all hoping that the government and compatriots in Guannei will quickly find a way to provide assistance. He believes that preserving the territory of the Northeast and 30 million people is the responsibility of everyone in the government and out of it. This is the most important thing at present, and other things can be temporarily ignored. He almost shed tears when he said this, and everyone looked at each other in dismay. Finally, he said that all the details would be discussed in Beiping.</p>
<p>On the 5th, the weather was clear and bright. Some of the commissioners got up early, disembarked, and took a walk. Because they were waiting for Sir Lytton, they did not leave for West Mountain until 9:00 AM. The Public Welfare Association had prepared dozens of rickshaws, and the rickshaw pullers were all wearing new straw hats and new uniforms, blue cloth with red letters, which were quite neat. Representative Gu was in the front, followed by the commissioners, winding like a long snake. They stopped everywhere to visit the various villages. Later, they sent to the top of Lianfeng Mountain, where the national flag was flying, and the beautiful scenery was all in sight. Everyone felt refreshed and wanted to ascend to immortality. By the time they reached Zhang Village to have refreshments, Madam Gu was already there, using her fluent English and French to interact with the commissioners. They then continued to lead them to visit the various villages on the beach. Along the way, they only heard the fragrance of flowers and the songs of birds, suspecting that it was a paradise. Everyone lingered, reluctant to leave. By the time they returned to the station, it was half an hour past the originally scheduled time.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, reporters again submitted written questions to the Investigation Commission. Sir Lytton answered on behalf of the commission, saying that the purpose of coming to the Northeast, from April 20 to June 4, was entirely to collect materials, that is, about the course of the September 18th Incident and the situation up to the present. These materials are sent to Geneva at any time for reference. Now they are still working continuously, so they cannot have any prior claims. Although they encountered many difficulties in the Northeast, these difficulties were not given by the Japanese government or the Japanese military authorities, but by third parties. The Investigation Commission has been patient in dealing with them. Now they are fortunate to have passed. The reason why General Ma Zhanshan was not able to meet was because the war in northern Manchuria was very fierce. To go there, they had to obtain the help of the local authorities in the Northeast and Russia, but this help was never obtained. The second step of the Investigation Commission's work is to hope to use the sincerity of the governments of China and Japan to find a solution. But they believe that both China and Japan have this sincerity.</p>
<p>The special train left Beidaihe at noon. Brigade Commander He Zhuguo went to Ping on the same train. The Investigation Commission had invited him to inquire in detail about the recent situation from the Customs. In the afternoon, at 5:00 PM, Li Hong, You Mijian, and Ms. Chen Yichun, secretaries of the Chinese Delegation, also arrived by boat from Shenyang via Dalian and boarded the train here. These three should have followed Representative Gu by land to Guannei, but the Japanese insisted on not allowing it, saying that the number of people going to Changchun could only be limited. Therefore, they had to take a detour. The Japanese Delegation has now increased to 21 people, saying that it is equal to the number of people in the Chinese Delegation going to Shenyang. Alas, the narrow-mindedness of the Japanese can be seen from this. At 5:30 PM, they arrived in Tianjin, only stopping for a moment. By the time they arrived in Beiping, it was 9:10 PM. Because the Investigation Commission requested to avoid tedious decorations, only the central banners "Welcome the League of Nations Investigation Commission" and "Welcome Representative Gu" were hung. Zhang Xueliang and others all came to welcome them. After exchanging greetings, Sir Lytton and his party went to the Beijing Hotel.</p>
<p>Representative Gu and his wife returned to their private residence in Tieshizi Hutong to rest. Members of the Chinese Delegation talked about their impressions of this trip, and their indignation was extraordinary. The surveillance in Changchun, Jilin, and Harbin was even stricter than in Shenyang. They did not participate in the Investigation Commission's meetings with local officials. However, they found many patriotic people everywhere who were willing to die for the motherland, and felt that the national spirit in the Northeast was very useful. When they passed through the so-called Fengshan Road, the trees on both sides had been cut short to prevent the volunteer army, and the atmosphere was extremely desolate. In Jinzhou, the Japanese only invited the Investigation Commission to inspect Jiaotong University and pointed to the Japanese pattern painted on the door, saying that when it was opened, it would be divided into two, which was evidence of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese sentiment. Westerners mostly laughed at it. Between Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan, many plainclothes teams were seen, some wearing long clothes, some wearing short clothes, some wearing hats, some without hats, some carrying sticks, and some carrying guns, with extremely inconsistent styles. In short, if you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know the danger of China. Once you go to the Northeast, your patriotic heart will naturally grow.</p>
<p>Although the people in the Investigation Commission kept their mouths shut, in private conversations, they felt that the Japanese were willing to be the leaders of the enemy, and the former Northeast bureaucrats could not shirk their responsibility. This time, the so-called "Manchukuo" has not been recognized from beginning to end. Not only has all the hospitality not been accepted, but even when meeting with Puyi, Zheng Xiaoxu, and others, only personal titles were used, which can be said to be painstaking. When negotiating with Ma Zhanshan in northern Shang, the Japanese actually said that the Investigation Commission only listened to Gu Weijun, disrupting local security and despising the existence of Manchukuo. Their attempt to cover the sky with one hand has been fully reflected in the mirror. (June 6)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspapers Promote Anti-Japan</h3>
<p>Heavy War Atmosphere in Vladivostok</p>
<p>According to a Moscow dispatch from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, the Soviet Union accused Japanese right-wing newspapers of openly advocating the occupation of Vladivostok, clearly exposing their challenging attitude towards the Soviet Union. The organ of the Central Executive Committee of Moscow, Izvestia, published an editorial saying that the Japanese authorities did not ban these remarks, and only chanted slogans of maintaining peace with the Soviet Union, while refusing to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, and its intentions can be seen. The organ of the Communist Party said that Japan overestimates its military strength and is challenging in every possible way, which is a fatal mistake. Now the Japanese imperialists have moved from propaganda to action, and we should actively prepare.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun stated that traffic between Harbin and Vladivostok is still cut off, and the war atmosphere in Vladivostok is also very strong. The local government imposes extra-legal taxes on the Japanese, and all Japanese residing in the area, except for a total of 34 employees of the Japanese Consulate and trading companies, have been completely expelled. Other Russians who associate with the Japanese have been exiled to northern Siberia to engage in harsh labor, and have starved to death one after another due to lack of supplies. The situation is tragic and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Japan's Foreign</p>
<h3>Trade is Increasingly Sluggish</h3>
<p>Reduced Demand for Japanese Goods in the United States</p>
<p>No Improvement in Trade with Shanghai</p>
<p>The Nagoya Shimbun said that in late May, foreign trade was in deficit of more than 20.3 million yuan, and the cumulative deficit since January has reached 255.3 million yuan, which is an unprecedented record. The main reasons for the slump are: first, the demand for Japanese goods in the United States has decreased, the import of cotton has been strong, and the export of raw silk has decreased sharply. In addition, the future of trade with Shanghai is uncertain, the receiving areas are still under martial law, there are many passengers on passenger ships going to Japan, and the number of passengers going to Shanghai from Japan is gradually decreasing. It will be difficult to restore trade immediately, and the trade situation is becoming increasingly sluggish.</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<h3>Purchases and Transports Huge Amounts of Foreign Machinery</h3>
<p>Is it to Invade China?</p>
<p>Or to Attack the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>New York Special Dispatch: Recently, the Japanese government has spared no effort in purchasing and transporting military machinery and gunpowder from various countries due to military demands and preparations. The results of the investigation are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>In February of this year, the Japanese government purchased a large amount of military supplies from German manufacturers, which were shipped from Elde to Japan. At the same time, it also ordered gunpowder from the Skoda Factory in Czechoslovakia, which was shipped in two batches. 700 boxes were shipped from Hamburg, Germany, and 4,000 boxes were shipped by the Zaward Steamer. Subsequent shipments are still countless. Because the Japanese government actively waged war against China, it specially sent a military commissioner to Czechoslovakia in February to contact various manufacturers to purchase machinery, which was generally shipped from the port of Trieste. The Skoda factory has a branch in France, which merged with the French SchniederCrersot factory. In February, it transported 18,000 bombs and 2,300 gas bombs to Japan. The above-mentioned Japanese military commissioner was also commissioned to go to Germany to order a large quantity of Acid from a German chemical factory for the purpose of manufacturing gunpowder. The word "Pianos" was falsely written on the box surface to deceive and cover up the outside world. In addition, the number of military supplies ordered from France, Britain, and the United States is also very alarming. It is estimated that 20 large tanks were ordered from the Solricce Works in France, and 4,000 aircraft bombs were manufactured at the France Antornobib Co. at Dijon. According to the US House of Representatives, the total number of purchases in the United States was 188 million gold yuan. The number of purchases in the United Kingdom was 42,000 gold pounds. The total number of purchases from Poland was more than 3 million yuan. The above are all transactions that have been completed in February and are known to the outside world. The numbers after February and those being processed are still under investigation. Japan's purchase of machinery in various countries is extremely secret. Various manufacturers are trying to maximize their profits, and their methods of deceptive shipping are also</p>

<p>emerging one after another. However, based on the above findings, there are already such alarming numbers in February, which is enough to arouse the attention of the world. (Ye sent on May 2)</p>
<p>Self-Defense Army</p>
<h3>Recapture of Acheng</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Between Chinese and Japanese Troops at Noon on the 2nd</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Acheng County was captured by the Self-Defense Army on the morning of May 30th. The majority of the Jilin puppet army's 8th Brigade, led by Chen Decai, defending the city, were surrounded and disarmed. Only one infantry company and one platoon each of mortars and machine guns, along with puppet brigade commander Chen Decai, fled back to Harbin. When Chen's brigade retreated to Daga River east of Harbin, Xi Qia immediately accused them of abandoning their duty and ordered the brigade to recover the lost territory immediately. However, the soldiers of Chen's brigade had originally cooperated with the Self-Defense Army and had only surrendered to the rebels a month prior under Chen Decai's leadership. Therefore, the soldiers were unwilling to engage the Self-Defense Army in battle. Chen, unable to command his soldiers, had no choice but to retreat. Upon hearing that Acheng had been recaptured by the Self-Defense Army, the Japanese army, fearing it would shake Harbin, immediately dispatched four aircraft to bomb Acheng from the air, causing fires within the city. Bombing continued on the 31st. Fearing excessive losses to merchants and civilians, the Self-Defense Army withdrew its entire force to Wujianfang and Baichengzi south of the city. Simultaneously, traffic on the Harbin-Suifenhe line was cut off. A 25-kilometer section of the railway between Acheng and Changshunzi, near Harbin, was also dismantled by the Self-Defense Army cavalry, disrupting eastbound passenger train service. The East Railway sent a relief train carrying dozens of workers to repair the line, but they were stopped by the Self-Defense Army. On the evening of the 31st, the Japanese army dispatched another train carrying engineering and infantry units to repair the tracks. By this time, the Self-Defense Army had retreated to Baichengzi, allowing the Japanese army to repair the railway. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, a Japanese unit opened fire on Acheng City after disembarking from a train at Ashihe, causing chaos throughout the city with smoke billowing. Hearing that the Japanese army had arrived, the Self-Defense Army also launched an attack on the Japanese army at 5:00 AM, and fierce fighting broke out in the outskirts of the city. By noon, the Japanese army had suffered over a hundred casualties and was on the verge of collapse, so they telegraphed Harbin for reinforcements. The Japanese army dispatched the Nakamura Brigade in four troop trains, while the Murai Brigade stationed at Yimianpo also sent its main force. By 1:00 PM, all units had arrived and joined the defense, intensifying the battle. Ashihe Station and the vicinity of Baichengzi were engulfed in artillery fire, and all eastbound passenger and freight trains on the East Railway were halted. At 2:20 PM in the afternoon, a large Japanese cavalry unit arrived in three troop trains to reinforce Acheng. Around 4:00 PM, the Japanese army circled around the Self-Defense Army's rear flank, forcing the Self-Defense Army to retreat towards Lalin and Shuangcheng County. After 7:00 PM, news arrived here that the fighting had ceased and that eastbound passenger trains had resumed service. It is reported that the main force of the Self-Defense Army consists of the Ma Xianzhang Brigade of Li Du's command, Yang Zibin's unit of Xing Zhaoxing's command, and Gong Changhai's cavalry detachment, numbering about 3,000 troops, under the command of the Self-Defense Army headquarters in Acheng County. Their tactics are purely guerrilla warfare, aimed not at occupying territory but at exhausting the Japanese army and dividing their forces to relieve the pressure on the Hulan-Hailun line. On the 28th of last month, they briefly attacked the city, then immediately retreated. They attacked again on the night of the 29th. The head of the Public Security Bureau's security brigade in the city, Liu, led his troops in response, and merchants and civilians welcomed the army into the city. They successfully captured it at 1:00 AM on the 30th. Yang, the chief of staff of the puppet 8th Brigade, Wei Xiufeng, the puppet Acheng County magistrate, and the chief of the Public Security Bureau were all captured. To punish the traitors, the Self-Defense Army executed Wei Xiufeng and the chief of the Public Security Bureau, and crippled Chief of Staff Yang by cutting off his feet. The Self-Defense Army now appears to be planning an attack on Shuangcheng. The Japanese army is tracking and pursuing them with cavalry. According to Japanese sources, the Self-Defense Army's attack was extremely fierce and their ammunition was plentiful (hence the Japanese side is quite fearful). It is also reported that the Self-Defense Army is now based in Bin County, where Xing Zhanqing and Feng Zhanhai are in command. Xing commands the Big Sword Society and Red Spear Society, with a force of about 30,000. In addition to the units of Li, Ding, and Xing, Feng Zhanhai commands about six brigades and nine detachments, also totaling around 30,000. Their organizational structure is as follows: Commander of the Jilin Self-Defense Army and Commander-in-Chief of the Right Route and Brigade Commander of the 1st and 6th Brigades Feng Zhanhai, Deputy Commander of the Right Route and Brigade Commander of the 3rd Brigade Gong Changhai, Brigade Commander of the 4th Brigade Yao Bingqian, Brigade Commander of the 2nd Brigade Zhao Weibin, Commander of the 5th Brigade Yang Wenlin, Detachment Commander of the 1st Cavalry Detachment Xia Yunlong, Detachment Commander of the 2nd Cavalry Detachment Guo Yukun, Detachment Commander of the 3rd Cavalry Detachment Jia Ruichen, Battalion Commander of the 1st Cavalry Battalion Feng Zhanwu, Battalion Commander of the 2nd Cavalry Battalion Huang Zhenting, Commander of the Special Service Regiment Kui En, Commander of the 1st Detachment and 1st Regiment of the Big Sword Martial Arts Group Duan Xifeng, Commander of the 2nd Regiment of the 1st Detachment of the Big Sword Martial Arts Group Zhao Yaozong, Commander of the 2nd Detachment and 3rd Regiment of the Big Sword Martial Arts Group Guo Shun, Commander of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Detachment of the Big Sword Martial Arts Group Ji Kuishan, Regimental Commander of the 1st Regiment of the 1st Brigade Deng Naibo, Regimental Commander of the 3rd Regiment of the 1st Brigade Zhang Guangxi, Regimental Commander of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade Zhao Xuetao, Regimental Commander of the 5th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade Yu Zhenpan, Regimental Commander of the 6th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade Yu Xiangzhen, Regimental Commander of the 7th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade Ge Fangting, Regimental Commander of the 8th Regiment of the 4th Brigade Li Haizhou, Regimental Commander of the 9th Regiment of the 4th Brigade You Yuanhui, Regimental Commander of the 10th Regiment of the 5th Brigade Kao Fenglin, Regimental Commander of the 11th Regiment of the 5th Brigade Zhang Shuting, Regimental Commander of the 12th Regiment of the 6th Brigade Liu Wanhui, Regimental Commander of the 13th Regiment of the 6th Brigade Liu Hongqi, Regimental Commander of the 14th Regiment of the 6th Brigade Mai Ruiting, Detachment Commander of the 1st Route of the People's Self-Defense Corps Liu Pinzhang, Regimental Commander of the 1st Regiment of the 1st Route of the People's Self-Defense Corps Zhang Yuheng, Regimental Commander of the 1st Regiment of the 2nd Route of the People's Self-Defense Corps Wang Xianzhang, Detachment Commander of the 1st Detachment of the 3rd Route of the People's Self-Defense Corps Zhao Zhuohua, Regimental Commander of the 4th Regiment of the 3rd Route of the People's Self-Defense Corps Feng Qingtai.

<p>Chen Jitang</p>
<h3>Taking Over Guangdong Railways</h3>
<p>A Supervisory Committee Established by the Provincial Government</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Chen Jitang is actively making arrangements for all military matters. Recently, the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou), Guangjiu (Guangzhou-Kowloon), and Guangsan (Guangzhou-Sanshui) Railways have been considered important organs for military transportation in the Southwest. These three railway bureaus were originally under the Central Ministry of Railways. However, the three railways are closely related to the Southwest, which makes it quite inconvenient to have them without a management organ in Guangdong. Therefore, Chen Jitang proposed at the 14th meeting of the Southwest Political Affairs Conference to take back the supervision and management of the three railways to Guangdong Province. This was approved, and it was resolved to assign responsibility for handling the matter to the provincial government and to order the formulation of measures and the commencement of taking over the three railways as soon as possible. After receiving the order, the provincial government drafted measures for the takeover, established a committee to supervise the three railways, and appointed Hu Jixian, Li Luchao, and Liu Juke, director of the Xicun Silk Factory, as members of the supervisory committee. The committee is located within the provincial government, and all staff members are assigned from various departments of the provincial government. Once the committee is established, the three railways will be handed over to it for specialized management. Monthly reports on the road construction projects, administrative and business conditions, and revenue and expenditure of each road must be submitted to the committee for consolidation. The provincial government has already issued a circular to the three railway bureaus notifying them of the change (June 3rd).</p>
<p>19th Route Army</p>
<h3>Enters Fujian in Three Batches</h3>
<p>Communists Retreat from Nanjing to Longyan Again</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Regarding the 19th Route Army's campaign to suppress bandits in Fujian, the provincial government received a telegram yesterday (3rd) from Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai of the army, stating that the first batch, the Mao Weishou Division, is scheduled to depart from Nanjing on the 5th. The second batch, the Ou Shouquan Division, will depart as soon as the second batch is ready. Both will land in Quanzhou and enter Zhangzhou via Tong'an. Army Commander Cai will also accompany the army to Zhangzhou to command everything. The third batch, the Shen Guanghan Division, will be led by Commander-in-Chief Jiang himself to the province to arrange the rear and organize a pacification office to liaise with the various armies in Fujian and handle the affairs of clearing the local area. It is expected that the dispatch will be completed within this month. As for the army's pay and the expenses for suppressing bandits, 900,000 yuan is needed each month. In addition to the 300,000 yuan allocated monthly by the central government, the army will raise the rest on its own. Currently, the army's representative, Fan Zongchi, is in Zhangzhou, consulting with Fang Shengtao, the acting chairman of the provincial government. However, the 400,000 yuan raised by the gentry and business communities in Xiamen to be remitted to the Gui army as funds for entering Fujian has been decided to be donated entirely to the 19th Route Army. As for the Red bandits, they retreated from Nanjing to Longyan again on the 1st and are setting up defensive works in the Da Chi and Xiao Chi areas in preparation for resistance. Therefore, in the future, the most intense battles for suppressing the bandits will be in the Longyan area. If Longyan can be captured, Tingzhou can be approached directly. (June 4th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents Expand Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Send Representatives Back to Country to State Opinions</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Japanese residents in Qingdao have been actively planning to expand the shipping industry in China. The other day, a general meeting of all Japanese residents in Shandong was held in the residential community to discuss the progress. It was decided to send Dao Dao and Jin Zu as representatives of all Japanese residents in Shandong to return to their country to advocate for an increase in scheduled shipping in order to permanently secure maritime commercial rights. Dao Dao and others took the Nikko Maru east yesterday, May 5th. It is reported that they will first go to Osaka and Kobe to meet with the mayors and commercial groups there to exchange views, and then transfer to Tokyo to strenuously argue the necessity of expanding the shipping industry to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Communications, and large trading companies such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi. This is a glimpse of their economic aggression (June 6th).</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province</p>
<h3>Sales Tax Implemented</h3>
<p>Specifically to Fund the New Divisions of the Security Command</p>
<p>But the Future of Various Taxed Products is Extremely Bleak</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: In Jiangxi Province, during the years of the Republic 15 and 16 (1926 and 1927), the total annual income from national and local taxes was approximately 24 million yuan. Subsequently, after the abolition of likin (internal transit tax) and the spread of banditry throughout the province, the annual income from national taxes is less than half of what it was before, while the local annual revenue budget, although listed at 6 million yuan, actually only brings in 3 to 4 million yuan. Recently, Zhao Shi-hui, the chairman of the provincial government, believing that more effort should be put into suppressing bandits due to the fact that out of the province's eighty-one counties, more than twenty counties, including Ruijin, Yudu, Hengfeng, and Shicheng, have completely fallen into the hands of bandits, more than twenty counties, including Tonggu, Dexing, Yongfeng, and Anhua, exist in name only, and more than twenty counties, including Xiushui, Ji'an, Qiyang, and Nanfeng, are plagued by the presence of local communists and have not been cleared after years of suppression. He then decided to expand the security forces into two Class B divisions, each with two brigades, and each brigade with two regiments, for a total of eight regiments. At the same time, security sub-commands would be established in eastern, western, southern, and northern Jiangxi, under the direct command of the Provincial Security Command, similar to the former military governors. Wei Su-zhong and Guo Bing were appointed as the heads of the western and eastern Jiangxi security sub-commands. The security teams had already been formed with four regiments, and the remaining regiments were being trained. However, the annual cost of this project is approximately 4 million yuan. Xiong then proposed at the provincial conference on clearing bandits to levy a special sales tax specifically to fund the expenses for suppressing bandits. Initially, the representatives from various counties rejected the proposal, believing that the people could not afford increased burdens due to the economic depression. However, after Xiong explained the various reasons, it was passed and sent to the provincial government for handling. The Finance Department has now appointed Hu Siyi, the former governor of Jiangxi Province, as the director of the Sales Tax Bureau, with the intention of starting the levy on June 1st. The products to be taxed include five items: porcelain, summer cloth, bamboo, wood, paper, and tea. It is estimated that the annual income could reach 3 to 4 million yuan. The Finance Department is currently preparing to establish 25 branch offices in the production and export areas of the above items for tax collection. Upon investigation, the production area for porcelain is Jingdezhen in Fuliang, which was captured by bandits last year, and its vitality has not recovered. Its sales have also been affected by the transport of foreign porcelain and finance, and its business is declining day by day. Fine summer cloth is produced in counties such as Wanzai and Yihuang, but the output has greatly decreased due to the banditry. Coarse summer cloth is produced in counties such as Fuzhou and Linchuan, and its sales are to various parts of Korea, but since the Wanbaoshan incident, sales have been cut off. There are already hundreds of thousands of unemployed male and female workers in Liduzhen, Linchuan. The production area for bamboo and wood is in remote mountain villages, most of which have now become bandit-controlled areas. In recent years, fir in southern Jiangxi has almost disappeared. The raw material for paper is bamboo, and the production area is also in poor mountain villages. Two-thirds of the paper-producing areas in counties such as Wanzai, Qianshan, and Yihuang have fallen into the hands of bandits, and the supply of paper is even scarcer, with prices already twice as high as before. The main production area for tea is Xiushui, which has also suffered from arson and looting by bandits, and no one enters the mountains. Moreover, its sales were mainly to Russia, but since the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, its exports have decreased to less than 50 percent. The output of the above items has decreased, and sales are sluggish, with a bleak future. The results of the tax collection can be predicted.</p>
<p>Aviation Administration</p>
<h3>Investigates the Truth of the Bengbu Bombing Tragedy</h3>
<p>Sends Lu Xinjiu and Zhong Liru to Bengbu</p>
<p>Compensation Will Be Given to the Affected Families</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Zhao Jingxian, the squadron leader of the 1st Aviation Squadron, dropped a thirty-five-pound bomb from a Vought Corsair aircraft number 102 while flying from Guangshan back to Bengbu, the bomb fell to the ground and exploded, killing and injuring sixty-three men and women. It stirred the entire city of Bengbu. Yan Yuting, the squadron leader of the 1st Squadron, immediately telegraphed the Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Military Affairs, reporting the truth of the incident. The Aviation Administration immediately sent Lu Xinjiu, the chief of the Medical Science Section, and Zhong Liru, a clerk of the Military Affairs Section, to Bengbu to investigate the cause of the accident, the extent of the damage, and the number of casualties in order to report to the Ministry of Military Affairs and request compensation for losses and condolences to the families of the victims. After receiving the order, Lu Zhong arrived in Bengbu on the morning of the 5th and went to the Garrison Command, the 1st Aviation Squadron, and the Public Security Bureau to investigate the truth of the tragic bombing. They also went to the Taiping Street bombing site with the head of the 3rd Precinct and the police to investigate the area destroyed by the bombing and the losses of the Liuxingsheng and Dechang grocery stores. They then went to the major hospitals treating the injured to inspect the injuries of the bombing victims. The results of the investigation were that twenty-two men and women were killed in the bombing, twenty-one of the bodies had been identified and claimed by their families for burial, and the body of an unknown person had been buried by the Swastika Society. Thirty-one people were seriously injured and receiving treatment in hospitals and at home, and ten others were slightly injured and had recovered. Upon hearing the news, the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce sent Sun Yuanfu and Xiang Yuncheng to meet with Lu Zhong to request that the Ministry of Military Affairs provide generous compensation to the families of those killed and injured in the bombing, and to ask the Aviation Detachment stationed in Bengbu to not fly over the city with bombs in the future to avoid further danger. Lu and others agreed to convey the request to the Aviation Administration and instructed them to comply. The Chamber of Commerce also submitted a report to the Bureau of Local Affairs. A certain Zhou in Jiaodao Xiaoguang has more than thirty shi of white rice, which has not been sold. During the past half-month, there have been frequent rice shortages in the villages. Zhou was vigilant, but the other day, a nearby farmer wanted to buy rice from Zhou and prepared to pay the price in cash. Zhou refused. The villager left angrily and later set Zhou's house on fire, which spread to the homes of the neighboring Zhou and Lin families, burning more than twenty rooms to the ground. It is said that the arson was committed by poor people nearby who were angry at not being able to buy rice.</p>
<p>Removing a Corrupt Official and Holding Him in Custody The Changshu County chief, Chen, believed that Zhang, the head of the 14th Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Zhangshe Town, 17th District, has exhibited unlawful behavior and has been investigated and found to be true. Yesterday, he specially ordered the County Public Security Bureau to quickly summon the branch head Zhang Jun to the bureau for custody and investigation. After receiving the order, Director Hua immediately sent Inspector Tuo Chuangfei to summon Zhang Jun to the bureau, place him under strict custody, and await investigation.</p>
<p>Ten Robberies in One Night: Four Boats Wuxi suffered failures in the spring, summer, and autumn of last year, resulting in flooded fields and crops. This year, it has also been affected by the Shanghai War, with merchants resting in the city and farmers abandoning their fields. All industries have come to a standstill, and there are four to five thousand unemployed people in society, excluding silk factory workers. Moreover, after the war, displaced people are returning to their homes, so petty theft and blatant robbery have been occurring frequently, making life difficult. Now that it is the Dragon Boat Festival, merchants in the villages entrusted boats to bring money to the city to pay merchants, which aroused the covetousness of bandits. The other day (7th), eight robberies of cargo ships, pig boats, and paper boats occurred in one day, totaling fourteen boats, with losses ranging from dozens to hundreds of yuan. Few people have reported the robberies. The following is a brief list of those who were robbed: (1) Five hundred yuan in cash and goods were robbed from the head of the area. (2) A boat in the northern area was also robbed at the same time, with losses of more than 400 yuan. (3) Boats from Huashu, Zhutang, and Taipingqiao were also robbed, with losses of dozens of yuan each. (4) The Jinwanxing Beef Shop at the Shanmenkou of Chong'an Temple in the city was robbed of a cash box by four vagrants. Two of the vagrants were caught on the spot by the patrol team and taken away for strict handling. Changshu</p>
<h3>Major Fire Outside the East Gate</h3>
<p>At 3:00 AM on the 6th of this month,</p>
<p>the Xingshun Bamboo Shop in Zhuhang outside the East Gate, due to carelessness with fire, suddenly burst into flames. Moreover, the goods in the shop were all straw mats, bamboo, baskets, and other flammable materials, making the fire even more dangerous. As a result, the fire intensified and became uncontrollable. At one point, hundreds of bamboo poles were burned and exploded, sounding like gunfire, causing the authorities to mistakenly believe it was gunfire and take strict precautions, not daring to go to the rescue. By the time the various energy societies arrived, more than an hour had passed, and the shop had been reduced to ashes. A total of fourteen rooms in the three-courtyard Xingshun Bamboo Shop were burned, along with six rooms in the Gao residence in the east and eight rooms in the Fuchengyu Dyeing Workshop to the west. The total loss is estimated to be over 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>A Bandit Den Busted in Wangdian In recent days, robberies have occurred frequently in Wangdian, Jiaxing, and the surrounding villages. The following is a breakdown of the incidents: (1) The home of Lin Yimao, a villager in Baofu Township, was broken into by bandits speaking in mixed dialects. The victim was tied up with rope, and silver, clothes, rice, and other items were robbed, resulting in significant losses. (2) On June 5th, the home of Qiu Xinggao, a villager in Baofu Township, was also robbed. Qiu Xinggao's right arm was stabbed with a knife, and he was tied up with rope and beaten. His wife, Shen, was also stabbed with an iron awl and forced to reveal the location of valuables, which were then robbed, including silver, silk wadding, clothes, and other items worth over 1,000 yuan. The next morning, Qiu Xinggao secretly reported to Lu Tongshen, the captain of the Baofu Township Defense Corps, who led platoon leaders and other members to Zhujiahui and arrested eight bandits from the Hunan Jiangbei gang in Chen Simao's residence, including Gao Mingyuan, Fan Xiusong, Chen Mingyuan, Chen Xiaogao, Chen Touzi, Fan Ronghua, Fan Wangshi, and Chen. Dozens of stolen items were recovered. The suspects were sent to the 5th District Defense Corps for questioning. After Lin Yimao and Qiu Xinggao identified many of the stolen items, the bandits were sent to the Jiaxing Local Court for interrogation on the afternoon of the 7th.</p>

<h3>CU Professors General Leave One Day To Demand Back Pay</h3>
<p>50% of December Salary Not Paid 50% of May Paid Unfairly</p>
<p>To Consider Student Studies Resumes Teaching on 7th and Issues a Statement</p>
<p>At the 15th meeting of the professors of National Central University, it was resolved that if the arrears for the first half of December were not paid before June 5th, a general leave would be taken, and the school authorities would be informed of this resolution in advance so they can prepare to avoid disruption of school affairs. At the beginning of this month, the school received a portion of its funding, and the professors association negotiated with Acting President Liu to use this money to first pay the December salaries, and then use the funding to pay 50% of May's pay, in order to avoid the general leave. Acting President Liu did not agree to this request, so 50% of the May salary was paid on the 5th of this month, which the professors association was very dissatisfied with. Unexpectedly, the professors association found out that a small number of people had received the full 50% payment, and the payment method was unfair, which caused great public outrage. On the morning of the 6th, a notice was issued in the name of the chairman of the professors association, stating that in accordance with the resolution of the 15th professors meeting, all professors would take a general leave from this day onwards, and a statement would be issued separately explaining the reasons. The students of the university, upon learning that the professors would take a general leave, believed that it would greatly affect their studies, so they elected representatives of the student body to express two opinions to the chairman of the professors association: (1) They expressed sympathy for the professors association's general leave due to the school's unfair payment of salaries. (2) They hoped that the professors association would resume classes from the 7th and thoroughly investigate the inside story of this salary payment. The chairman's office agreed to submit the matter for discussion at the afternoon meeting. At the same time, Acting President Liu Guanghua summoned the chairman of the professors association to the president's office to persuade them not to use the arrears to force a strike, which would disrupt the students' studies, and hoped that they would persuade the professors to resume classes as soon as possible. He said that 50% of the December salary had been borrowed from the bank and would be paid on the 9th of this month, and that the remaining month and a half of arrears would be paid as soon as possible. At 4:00 PM, all the professors held the 16th meeting in Zhizhitang, chaired by Ding Siyi, Liu Yunchou, and Zhang Qiyun. They resolved: (1) To accept the students' request and resume classes on the 7th, bearing the pain. (2) To issue a statement on the situation of the school's salary payment to avoid social misunderstanding. The statement would be drafted by the chairman's office and issued after each individual signs and seals it. At 6:00 PM, the professors association held the 15th professors meeting again, and resolved that if the school did not clear the December salary arrears by the 15th of this month, a general leave would be taken from the 16th.</p>
<h3>Central University Professors' Declaration of General Leave on June 6th</h3>
<p>Since last year, due to the school's dire financial situation and three months of unpaid salaries, and with the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, the former school president, now Minister of Education, Zhu Liuxian, suddenly resigned under some pretext. He ordered Zhang Xiunan, the former head of the accounting department and now Director of General Affairs of the Ministry of Education, to misappropriate tens of thousands of yuan from various special funds of the school to pay the full salaries of the president and staff of the general office from November of last year to January of this year. According to the accounting records, former President Zhu received 2,025 yuan, former Dean of the Law School and current Acting President Liu Guanghua, and former Secretary-General, now Director of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education, Guo Xinsong, each received 1,200 yuan, totaling 2,400 yuan. The two former president's secretaries and the heads of the five departments of documentation, registration, accounting, general affairs, and publishing each</p>
<h3>Records of Striking the Bell at the Old Temple (10)(7)</h3>
<p>Not Removing the Court Grass,斋夫 [pen name]</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Song said, "Excellent! I like the first four lines the most. The teachers of the past were simply King Yama. Children were more terrified of teachers than little devils. I would never feel at ease leaving my little grandson with such a teacher. If the teacher treats children as precious treasures, then I will have no worries." Brother Chunsheng said, "'The teacher grows his own grain' shows that the teacher respects farming, and we farmers will certainly welcome that." I said, "Of these five poems, there is one line I don't quite understand. What does 'the bench sticks to the backside' mean? Please, teacher," give me some guidance."</p>
<p>The teacher said, "In the past, scholars only agreed to teach young children after they had failed in their careers. Therefore, their profession was called 'sitting in a study.' In their eyes, sitting in a study was a poor job. Because there weren't many people competing for it, it was also called 'sitting on a cold bench.' When you first sit on it, you inevitably feel a bit icy, but after sitting for a long time, it becomes warm and sticky. This line of poetry describes a teacher who 'sits but doesn't do.' What about now? This bench is still as cold as ever. After a day of hard work, we can sit on it to rest; but if we greedily sit on it until it becomes sticky again, then we will have failed this valuable cold bench. In a letter to a friend, I further advocated for a reform of this kind of life. Now I might as well say it out loud for everyone's instruction. What I wrote in this letter was:</p>
<p>'The teachers of the past,' loved to sit on cold benches. Modern teachers, barefoot, carry manure." We couldn't help but laugh at the last line. But in the laughter, there was a kind of indescribable respect. Finally, I asked, "I heard some people say that Teacher's Day has the meaning of 'respecting scholars.' What does Mr. Zhu think?"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said, "Is a teacher a scholar? Should scholars be respected? Is respecting scholars the same as respecting teachers? To answer these questions clearly, we must first know what the so-called 'scholar' of the past actually was. This is a small portrait of a 'scholar' based on ancient farmers' understanding, depicted by me:</p>
<p>'The four limbs are not diligent, the five grains cannot be distinguished, if successful, they become officials, if poor, they become teachers.' People of this kind do not deserve anyone's respect in the modern age. In the past, those lazy scholars who loved to eat were at the top of the four classes of people. Now, only those who rely on their own hands to farm and work to earn a living can be considered first-class citizens. The status of scholars has declined. Although we cannot respect scholars, we must respect teachers. Those who teach people to farm well are teachers of agriculture. Those who teach people to work well are teachers of industry. Those who teach 400 million people to stand up to seize civil rights, protect the nation, and promote people's livelihoods, thereby creating a Republic of China that lives up to its name, are teachers of the people. If farmers do not respect teachers, then agriculture will surely go bankrupt; if workers do not respect teachers, then industry will surely be crude; if the people do not respect teachers, then the country will not be able to become rich and strong. But those who want to be respected must first respect themselves. Respecting teachers starts with teachers respecting themselves. Take off your official hats! Take off your doctoral caps, masters' caps, and bachelors' caps! Get rid of the ambition of wanting to be a head taller than white-collar workers! Stretch out a pair of hands that can move freely! 'Scholars' transformed into 'workers' can then become teachers. The original meaning of June 6th is to respect teachers -- to respect teachers like this. If it is used to maintain the status of scholar-officials, then it is going backward. Therefore, I believe that the great significance of Teacher's Day lies in transforming scholars into workers, in transforming teachers who teach books into teachers who do work, teaching people to do experimental work, productive work, construction work, and creative work to build new villages, a new China, and a new world. Everyone, am I right?"</p>
<p>Regarding the teachers and all the assistant teachers in each faculty and librarians,</p>
<p>at the beginning of the Shanghai war, each only received twenty yuan for the November salary. As the teachers were distressed by the suffering of the disaster victims and felt their own difficulties, they endured it silently and dared not announce it to society because of the national crisis. For several months, the Shanghai situation gradually calmed down, and the school officially resumed classes. The government also issued maintenance funds from February at 30% to 50% per month. The distribution of maintenance funds in the school is decided by the school affairs meeting and the faculty representatives of each faculty, and those who attend the school affairs meeting, apart from the president, are all faculty members of the faculty association. However, apart from advocating for the full payment of salaries to lower-paid staff or an additional percentage, and reserving full project funds for the school, the faculty members still only received 30% to 50% of their salaries, only a few tens of yuan or a few hundred yuan per month. Although the cost of living in the capital is high, and the faculty members were often unable to make ends meet, considering that the national finances were extremely strained, the faculty members internally tried their best to maintain the livelihood of low-paid staff, and externally, apart from appealing to the government to fully pay the salaries, they dared not complain. Their difficult situation in maintaining education should be understood by the gentlemen of the country. However, regarding the unpaid salaries that former President Zhu, Acting President Liu, and others had already received but the faculty members had not, we should ask Mr. Zhu and Mr. Liu to be responsible for raising funds. We held several meetings and sent representatives to contact the two gentlemen one after another, but the two gentlemen only made excuses and delayed, and have not shown any sincerity. Considering that the summer vacation was approaching, we held the 14th faculty meeting on May 16th and decided to ask the school to pay off the arrears before January by the 10th of this month, and separately sent letters to Mr. Zhu and Mr. Liu. Former President Zhu ignored it, and Acting President Liu replied that the deadline was too short and could not be complied with. The faculty members strongly disagreed and held the 15th meeting on May 31st, automatically extending the deadline to July 5th, paying half a month's salary before the 5th of this month, and issuing formal receipts for the flood relief donations from last year in the shortest possible time. We separately sent representatives to inform Mr. Zhu and Mr. Liu in person, but as a result, former President Zhu did not recognize the legally organized group of faculty members as having a legal basis, and only agreed to have private talks with each representative, and did not acknowledge the date of payment of arrears at all. Acting President Liu agreed to announce the date of payment of half a month's arrears before the 5th, but the actual payment would have to be on the 7th, which had already been agreed upon. However, as late as the 6th, Acting President Liu had not yet announced the date of payment of arrears, willingly going back on his word without any concern. On the one hand, former President Zhu even broadcast rumors to threaten to dissolve Central University. The faculty members could no longer bear it and decided to take a general leave of absence within the scope permitted by the school to express their protest, in order to attract the government's attention and to promote the awakening of Mr. Zhu and Mr. Liu. This is why there is a general leave of absence today. However, considering the students' studies, the 16th meeting this afternoon still decided to resume classes from the 7th with great reluctance, and announced the school's salary payment process and the reasons for the faculty members' leave of absence, awaiting the judgment of the government and the gentlemen of the country. The faculty members would like to further state their demands as follows: (1) Please ask former President Zhu and Acting President Liu to send the misappropriated flood relief donations from last year to the relief agencies within three days. (2) Please ask former President Zhu and Acting President Liu to pay off in installments the arrears before January, which they had already received four months ago, by July 5th. As for whether school administrators can receive priority pay, whether flood relief donations can be misappropriated, and whether those who misappropriate flood relief donations can continue to manage the country's education, the government has its own discretion, which is not what we want to discuss. This declaration is hereby made, and we hope that the government authorities and the gentlemen of the country will further enlighten us. (June 6, 21st year [of the Republic of China])</p>

<p>Wartime Labor School Returns to Original Site</p>
<p>The second, fourth, fifth, and tenth schools established by the Labor Education Committee of this city were appropriately located in the war zone after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, making it impossible to attend classes. To avoid wasting students' studies, they were temporarily relocated to Wulin Road, Xinzha Road, Robert Sheng Road, and other places to continue classes. Now that the situation is calm and local order has gradually been restored, except for the tenth school, which is facing practical difficulties and has been ordered to continue operating at the intersection of Robert Sheng Road and Jiaozhou Road, the other three schools, such as the second, fourth, and fifth, have officially returned to their original locations to attend classes starting on June 1st.</p>
<p>Preparing</p>
<h3>National Sports Conference</h3>
<p>Plan to First Organize a Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education is preparing to convene a National Sports Conference and is currently drafting rules for the preparatory meeting, as previously reported in this newspaper. Since the release of this news, the Ministry of Education has received letters from people in the sports community inquiring about the progress of preparations and offering suggestions. In particular, Mr. Chu Minyi, the current Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, is known for promoting sports and is very sympathetic to the convening of the National Sports Conference. The Ministry of Education has drafted the rules for the preparatory meeting and sent them to Mr. Chu, and asked him to designate a time for Li Zheng, Director of the Social Education Department, to go to discuss and agree on the meeting date and all preparatory matters. Once the consultation is confirmed, the Ministry of Education will organize the preparatory committee for the National Sports Conference in the near future.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Public Doubles</p>
<h3>Yu and Zheng Are Indeed Powerful</h3>
<p>Straight Set Victory Over Chen Min and Chen Xianzhang</p>
<p>Tu Ling, Ma Tang, and Yi Obtain Complex Rights</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang, in yesterday's public doubles tennis two-week tournament, indeed defeated Chen Xianzhang and Chen Min with a score of 6-2, 6-0, 6-0 to win the right to the semi-finals. Tu Kaiyuan and Ling Xianyang will compete with Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang on the 12th for the right to the final. Another group, Ma Anquan and Tang Yongchun, won two matches. The results yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang Zheng Zhaojia 6-2 6-0 6-0 Chen Xianzhang Chen Min</p>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan Ling Xianyang 6-4 6-3 8-6 Chen Guocheng Shen Meizhen</p>
<p>Ma Anquan Tang Yongchun 3-6 3-6 6-4 8-6 9-7 Mao Honggui Liang Guanying</p>
<p>Yu and Zheng's performance: Zheng Zhaojia was naturally the best, with a forehand smash that was unmatched. It's a pity that he wasn't always careful, and sometimes missed the net. The serve and volley were both very effective. Yu Tianguang was slightly inferior, perhaps because they hadn't cooperated perfectly. There were many balls that he didn't have the confidence to kill.</p>
<p>Tu Ling's victory record: Tu Kaiyuan was the most outstanding, with a powerful serve and a great volley, scoring many points. Tu Ling often used angled shots to the east and shot to both sides, making Chen and Shen exhausted. The match between Ma and Tang against Mao and Liang was evenly matched and difficult. In the end, victory or defeat was determined by endurance.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Again Weak</h3>
<p>(Report by American Eastern Bank)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the New York stock market, all parties maintained a cautious attitude. The daily transaction volume was only 800,000 shares. Industrial stocks continued to fall by 1.85 pounds. Because there were very few incoming households on the market, prices tended to weaken. The market failed to recover later because there were few short sellers. The anxious news on Tuesday was the unemployed's demonstrations and the re-raising of the veterans' pension case. If this case is passed, the budget will still not be balanced, which will affect the economy. If it is rejected, the market sentiment will definitely improve. The relationship is not shallow. The Dow Jones index is attached as left:</p>
<p>June 6 June 7 Up/Down</p>
<p>30 Industrials 49.32 47.47 Down 1.84</p>

<p>Yarn, Flower, and American Cotton Initially High, Then Returned</p>
<h3>The Result Presents a Slightly Active Appearance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but later weakened due to favorable weather and the slump on Wall Street. Futures rose by 2 to 4 pounds, while spot prices remained unchanged. English cotton futures rose by 4 to 6 points, while spot prices fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegram records are left:</p>

<h3>No Business Done for Current Yarn</h3>
<p>People's hearts are all trending towards softening.</p>
<p>The spot market condition of cotton yarn has not started to do business. There are sparse gatherings in the market. Because the summer festival is a big holiday, the market is closed, but most people's hearts are tired. American cotton rose slightly by 2 to 4 pounds. Customers are all in a stagnant state, and sales are very small. This is because the world situation is extremely sluggish, and overseas yarn prices are too cheap. All parties are full, and this yarn has suffered a major blow. At this time, the various Chinese yarn factories should try to ship their goods to various provinces for competitive sales. Moreover, raw materials are cheap, and there is a profit to be made. They should quickly seize the opportunity to catch up so that the accumulation of bottom goods is relaxed. However, only a certain large merchant is selling his own goods to other ports, so the clock yarn is tighter. Other factories' stockpiles are increasing daily. As for Wuxi yarn, it is also being shipped to Shanghai one after another. It is found that the yarn from that place used to be sold all the way to Xuzhou and Jinan, but now it is being snatched away by Japanese yarn landed in Qingdao. Therefore, they can only seek a way out in Shanghai. The second reason is the decline of the countryside and the economic depression. The people in the interior have no ability to buy. For these reasons, some people have a psychological view of the standard yarn, predicting it will be around 145 taels.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Affected by Military Affairs</p>
<h3>No Hope for Silkworm Harvest in Kunshan</h3>
<p>Silkworm farming in the four rural areas of Kunshan has gradually made progress in recent years. Farmers in Tian 14th Tu and Chong 2nd Tu, Pengjian Town, outside the east gate, all pay attention to sericulture. However, the Shanghai Incident suddenly broke out, and the National Army retreated to Kunshan. The four rural areas were dug with trenches for war, and agriculture and sericulture were greatly affected. No spring silkworms were raised. By the time the ceasefire was concluded and the army withdrew, sericulture had ended. Although a small number of farmers who planted mulberry fields raised late silkworms, they suffered from immoderate cold and warmth, with more rain and less sunshine. Silkworm ants developed poorly, and silkworm diseases were rampant. Although there were silkworms in each tu outside the east, the sun warmed up and then cooled down, and the silk spinning was delayed. This year, the spring silkworm harvest in Kunshan will inevitably be hopeless.</p>
<h3>Foreign Bank Silk Market Closed for Summer Festival</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the summer festival, which has been a custom for generations. Chinese and foreign silk merchants were closed for the day as usual. There was no market for foreign bank silk, so there was no market to report.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan New Tea Sells Well at Firm Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of the opening of the Wuyuan new tea market. Although the Shanghai tea market was not good, mountain prices did not fall because of it. The tea houses were forced to open the market and could not stop. The mountain households had less tea in stock and refused to lower prices. Therefore, yesterday the opening prices in various villages were still between 50 and 80 yuan, with no major difference from the previous few days. The prices were: Northern Township, Zhe Yuan, Li Keng, 66 yuan; Hong Yuan, He Kengkou, 70 yuan; Liubao Yuan, Yanxia, 55 yuan; Luxia Cheng, Hongcun, Hengting 60 yuan; Xiashi, Shicun 56 yuan; Chengjia 70 yuan; Jiachun 80 yuan; Southern Township, Taibai 58 yuan; Bingkeng 60 yuan; Western Township, Jiadao 56.5 yuan; Hushan 59 yuan; Congshan 70 yuan. The amount of tea purchased by each house was about 100 dan, which was enough to make the first batch. Among them, Gaoan Cantonese merchant Qian Jixiang had purchased more than 300 dan. Judging from the enthusiastic demand from the tea houses in recent days, the prices are unlikely to fall. The tea houses that have purchased tea have all started to pick and roast, rushing to make fine goods such as Zhenmei to be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Tea Market Suddenly Turns Cold</h3>
<p>Since the Tunxi tea houses received news that export sales in Shanghai were sluggish, their attitude suddenly became negative. The amount of tea purchased by each house was extremely small. Yesterday, Shangxikou in Xiu County opened, offering 75 yuan, while goods with slightly inferior leaf quality offered 60 yuan. The import of foreign tea into this port has not been enthusiastic. Only a small number of Huizhou merchants sold goods sporadically. There is no large batch of new goods on the market for going to the tea market. Therefore, less than half of the Tunxi tea houses are currently producing tea. The market situation is particularly sluggish.</p>
<h3>Fuliang Tea Officially Opens</h3>
<p>The tea farmers in the southeast townships of Fuliang Prefecture have all completed the picking and manufacturing. The tea merchants from Xiu and Wu have gathered in various villages to search for purchases. Moreover, they are eager to purchase the tender heads, and the merchants are happy to increase their purchases. After discussions in various places in recent days, the market has officially opened. The market price is from 48 yuan to 60 yuan. The first batch of new goods has been shipped out one after another, and the second batch is being searched for and handled.</p>
<h3>The Final Chapter of the Qimen Tea Market</h3>
<p>Due to the rain, the output of Qimen black tea was not strong, and the amount of tea purchased by each house was small.</p>
<p>In previous years, each batch was 100 boxes, but this year it is only 70 to 80 boxes, and the smallest is only 50 to 60 boxes. Although the market is about to close, a small number of tea houses want to add to the production to make a final batch. Recently, mountain households in Jiujiahe in southern Qimen are still picking and manufacturing late tea. The market price is from 30 yuan to 40 yuan. There are also those who cannot afford to pay for expenses and are stranded. It is difficult to close the market immediately.</p>
<h3>Hardware and Egg Factories Help Purchase Tinplate</h3>
<p>The tinplate market has been very good recently. The egg factory group that arose was the helper with many purchases yesterday, and a wide range of transactions were made. The market was unusually firm. American 100-pound goods also opened at 31 taels, British goods at 25 taels, and American 90-pound goods were estimated at 14 taels, and British goods were estimated at 10 taels. It is heard that the market is still bullish.</p>
<h3>Kailuan Coal Loosening</h3>
<p>Kailuan coal lumps and dross have been quite strong recently, and the inventory in the stacks is also large, so the selling price has loosened slightly. The market sold yesterday fell by 3-4 qian per ton. The current selling price is 8 taels and 6 qian per ton for No. 1 dross, and 8 taels and 2 qian for No. 2 dross, and 9 taels for Linxi lumps.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Visited Song Ziwen and Chen Mingshu</p>
<p>Earnestly Urging Them to Withdraw Their Resignations</p>
<p>Also Met with Sun Ke to Discuss Guangdong Affairs</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, along with Gu Mengyu, the Minister of Railways, and Chu Minyi, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Nanjing the night before last. They arrived at the Zhenru Railway Station at around 8:00 AM yesterday. Those who went to Zhenru to welcome them included Madame Chen Bijun, Guo Taiqi, Wu Tiecheng, and others. After Wang got off the train, he and the welcoming officials boarded separate cars and returned to his residence. At 9:20 AM, Wang went to Song Ziwen's residence on Qiqi Road to visit the Minister of Finance, Song Ziwen, and earnestly urged him to stay. Song expressed that the financial authorities are now in dire straits and that he is too weak to continue to maintain the situation, and he firmly declined Wang's request to stay. Wang then put forward his suggestions on the central financial plan, and they discussed it for about half an hour before Wang excused himself and returned to his residence. At 10:00 AM, Wang went to Chen Mingshu's residence on Shanzhong Road to meet with Chen Mingshu, urging him to withdraw his resignation and return to Nanjing to resume his duties as soon as possible. They talked for nearly two hours. Chen explained in detail the difficulties that made it impossible for him not to resign, and his attitude was still very firm. Wang then returned to his residence for lunch. At 3:00 PM, Central Committee Member Wu Zhihui, accompanied by Chu Minyi, visited Wang at his residence. At 3:50 PM, Wang took a car to Sun Ke's residence on Yingli Ai Road to meet with Sun Ke and discuss Guangdong affairs. They also had a very detailed discussion on Sun's recently proposed draft outline for resisting Japan and saving the country. Regarding the issue of resuming diplomatic relations with Russia, Wang put forward the central government's specific views. Wang returned to his residence at around 5:00 PM. At 5:10 PM, the Minister of Railways, Gu Mengyu, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng visited Wang one after another and had a long talk. It is said that Wang's visit to Shanghai was only to urge Song and Chen to withdraw their resignations, and there were no other tasks. He is scheduled to stay for two days and then return to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Agrees to Withdraw Completely Soon</h3>
<p>A Reply is Expected Within Days</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, Okazaki, the Japanese member of the Joint Committee, again notified Yu Hongjun, the Chinese member, by telephone yesterday morning, saying that the Japanese naval authorities stationed in Shanghai are currently in the process of transition between the old and new administrations. Therefore, both the old and new officials have no time to take care of this issue and need more time to consult with the new naval commander. Once a result is reached, they will reply. Afterwards, Secretary-General Yu told a reporter from the Far East News Agency that the Japanese attitude is still sincere. Therefore, the withdrawal of Japanese troops should not be a problem, but there may still be a delay of one or two days. However, since the Japanese side has this situation, we should also be understanding and delay for one or two days, which should also be acceptable.</p>
<p>According to Mayor Wu Tiecheng's statement to a reporter from the East China News Agency, regarding the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the Japanese side has expressed its intention to withdraw immediately. However, due to the transition between the old and new administrations, the procedures will be delayed for a few days. Regarding the rumors circulating in Zhabei in recent days, Mayor Wu formally stated yesterday that these incidents are entirely the result of malicious people spreading rumors and provoking trouble. For example, someone fired a gun near Tiantong'an Road on the evening of the 6th, and the outside world suspected that it was the Japanese army provoking trouble. However, investigations have now proven that it is not true, and two suspects have been arrested. In addition, Japanese troops often come and go to demonstrate in Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, and other places in recent days. Mayor Wu said that this is because the Japanese army still has Japanese military police stationed in these areas, and they come and go from time to time to rotate defenses. Residents do not understand and thus misunderstand.</p>

<p>Negotiations on Building Roads Beyond the Boundaries</p>
<h3>The Consular Body Will Not Hold a Meeting for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Will Wait for Yu Hongjun to Contact Ke Yinhan First</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of building roads beyond the boundaries of the Public Concession, after the Shanghai Municipal Government and the authorities of the Public Works Department drafted a solution, our side has submitted the entire case to the government for review. At the same time, the concession authorities have also submitted it to Ke Yinhan, the American Consul-General and leader of the Shanghai Consular Body, for his approval. Therefore, the consular body intends to convene a meeting to consider this issue. However, according to Secretary Lang of the Consular Body, the consular body cannot hold a meeting in the near future. Negotiations on building roads beyond the boundaries will probably be determined after Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government has contacted Ke Yinhan once.</p>
<p>According to the Dalu News, regarding the issue of building roads beyond the boundaries, the leader of the consular body had not yet received a formal report on the solution agreed upon by the representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the representatives of the Public Works Department as of yesterday evening (July 7th). Yesterday, a reporter from the Dalu News specifically visited Ke Ninghan, the leader of the consular body. Ke said that since he had not yet formally received the agreed articles, it was not convenient to express any opinion, but he stated frankly that the management rights of the roads outside the boundaries had often been in dispute in recent years. In this environment, it is urgently necessary to have an agreement. Yesterday, a reporter from the Dalu News also learned that the local Japanese authorities had not lodged any protests against the consular body's approval of the draft. In fact, as of yesterday afternoon, the Japanese Consulate-General had not yet received the proposed draft articles, so there was no way to approve or disapprove them. However, the Japanese press's Shanghai bureau had telegraphed the draft to Tokyo, so it is possible that the Japanese government has protested. Later, a reporter from the Dalu News visited Fessenden, the Director-General of the Public Works Department. Fessenden said that he was not yet able to discuss the matter. At this time, he could only state that what the committee members had agreed upon could not be regarded as an agreement, and in fact there was no agreement. The proposed draft has not yet been delivered to the consular body or the diplomatic corps. When the reporter asked about the content of the articles, Fessenden declined to disclose them, saying that it was not yet time to publish them, but he said that the representatives of the Public Works Department had tried their best to find a peaceful and satisfactory solution to this problem.</p>
<h3>Liu Manqing Hosted a Press Conference Yesterday to Report on Her Trip to Kham and Tibet</h3>
<p>Departing Again for Kham and Tibet Today</p>
<p>Ms. Liu Manqing hosted a press conference at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, attended by more than thirty reporters from various newspapers, as well as Ms. Liu's sister, Man Yun, and others. Ms. Liu first reported on her trip to Kham and Tibet. Ms. Liu is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong today, transfer to Yunnan, and then go to Xikang and Tibet to conduct investigations. The talk ended at around 5:00 PM, followed by a group photo. The text of Ms. Liu's speech is recorded below: "Dear reporters, dear guests, dear comrades, since the military-civilian conflict in Xikang on February 26th this year, due to the distance and lack of accurate information, the truth is largely unknown to the outside world. Fortunately, you all care about Kham and Tibet, and we are gathered here today. I would like to report to you on the truth in Kham. Xikang is located between Sichuan and Tibet and has long been subjected to violence from both sides. The people are ignorant, and there is a language barrier. It is like a dumb person eating Coptis chinensis - unable to express their suffering. This has been the case for a long time. In recent years, the government has considered ways to save them, but it has always been deceived by individuals who monopolize the process, so the government's concern for the people of Kham cannot reach them, and the people of Kham's sincere desire to support the government has no way to reach the authorities. After repeated delays, they are becoming more and more estranged. Comrade Gesang Zeren, who is a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, saw the suffering of the people of Kham and knew that it could not be alleviated by sitting and talking. Therefore, he invited comrades from seven provinces, including Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Fujian, to request permission from the central government to enter Kham to establish a party. On June 10th of last year, he entered Kham via Sichuan and Yunnan. Those from Yunnan arrived in Kham on September 15th of last year, and they went to various counties to promote the Three Principles of the People, distribute various propaganda books and paintings in both Han and Tibetan, and mimeographed Han-Tibetan textbooks, established the Ba'an Library, and prepared to organize party headquarters in various counties, which was deeply trusted by all the people of Kham. However, Liu Wenhui, the commander-in-chief of the Sichuan-Kang border defense forces, strongly disagreed. On the one hand, he detained seven comrades, including Wang Xifeng, who had arrived from Sichuan, in Chengdu, and they have not arrived to this day. On the other hand, he secretly ordered the Sichuan army stationed in Kham to arrest them strictly. On February 26th, he shot and killed Dai Langxi, the propaganda officer, causing public outrage. The next morning, the people disarmed all the stationed troops. On March 5th, more than 140 representatives from Ba'an, Yanjing, Xiangcheng, Daocheng, Derong, Yidun, Lihua, and Yajiang counties gathered in Ba'an and unanimously decided to organize a provincial construction committee based on the provincial order, prepare for provincial construction, and establish a provincial defense army for self-defense. Comrade Ge was publicly elected to take charge of the matter. Comrade Ge, in view of the strict party discipline and the national crisis, was extremely frightened by the occurrence of this unfortunate incident. He telegraphed the central government in Dongge every day, waiting for a decision, and the matter was filed. However, Liu Wenhui telegraphed the central government, saying that Comrade Ge was colluding with the Tibetan side and betraying the party and the country. He even fabricated a central government order and offered a reward for his arrest. His arrogance and disregard for the central government can be imagined. Moreover, his killing of party commissioners is not a one-time event, and the whole country knows it. As for his abuse of the people of Kham, there is a precedent for the abuse of the people of Sichuan. Moreover, during his six years of governing Kham, in addition to adding seventeen kinds of additional taxes, pre-collecting grain taxes until the 38th year of the Republic, deceiving the people of Kham, raising 280,000 yuan for anti-Japanese expenses, losing two counties, Ganzhan, last year, and causing a riot in the Ma Brigade on February 15th this year, looting Kangding, and shooting and killing party affairs personnel on February 26th, what achievements can he speak of? Is there any reason for the existence of such a tyrannical warlord who destroys party affairs, harms Kham, and endangers the people? Should he be sanctioned by the people? Please judge fairly. After I reported the above details to the Central National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the central government has discerned his treachery and decided to establish a province. His plan failed, so he ostensibly claimed to recover the lost land, but secretly ordered Ma Chenglong, Huang Xunye, and Yu Ruhai's three brigades to attack Ba'an and other counties in southern Kham in order to fulfill his ambition to harm the people. Little did he know that the people's anger was too deep and they would die with him. After ten days of fierce fighting, Ma and Huang's entire forces were intercepted into several sections, and the grain transport was cut off. On April 2nd, they were disarmed again. Liu Wenhui has repeatedly claimed that Ganzhan has been recovered and that the Tibetan soldiers are launching a strong counterattack. Although he is not deceiving people, he has too many stolen reputation telegrams and dares not believe them deeply. I still hope that the central government will send senior officials to handle the matter fairly, so that all problems can be solved easily. I especially hope that you will give just assistance and provide practical guidance."</p>
<h3>Zhang Huichang Arrived in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Former Guangdong Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhang Huichang, because his mediation of the Guangdong Incident was ineffective, arrived in Shanghai by the Dollar Line's President Lincoln from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, and will arrive at the port this afternoon. The ship is moored at the Yangshupu pontoon. It is said that after Zhang arrives in Shanghai, he will take a car to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Li Shijia Arrived in Shanghai from Japan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Report to Nanjing Within Days and Then Go to Japan</p>
<p>The Riri News reported that Li Shijia, the Permanent Vice Minister of the Navy, went to Japan a month ago to negotiate the construction of the Ninghai warship. The ship has now been completed and launched in Japan. He returned to China in advance on the Nagasaki Maru and arrived at the Huishan Wharf in this port at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those who went to welcome him included Tongji ship captain Chen Yongqin, Jing'an ship captain Zhang Rizhang, and Naval Headquarters Adjutant Zhang, as well as Japanese military attaché Uehara and military attaché Kitaoka, who also personally went to the wharf to welcome him. After Li landed, he drove back to his private residence on Fuxu Road. It is said that Li has decided to go to Nanjing within days to report everything to the Navy Department, and then go to Japan again to lead the new Ninghai ship back to China.</p>
<p>The Customs Huaxing Patrol Ship</p>
<h3>Held a Launching Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>The East China News Agency reported that the Jianghai Customs had previously found that the sea area under its jurisdiction was quite wide, and the existing police force was insufficient to maintain it. Therefore, last year, it entrusted the Jiangnan Shipyard to build two patrol ships, Huaxing and Feixing. Construction began in November of last year and has been underway for seven months. Although it went through the January 28th Incident, work never stopped and has been largely completed. The Huaxing ship was launched at the Gaochang Temple in the shipyard yesterday afternoon, and Mrs. Mayers, the Inspector General of the Jianghai Customs, performed the bottle-breaking ceremony. The Feixing patrol ship will also be launched within three weeks. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Ceremonial Platform: The Huaxing patrol ship was parked on the ground in the boiler room of the shipyard. A temporary platform was set up in front of the ship for the use of guests watching the launch. Naval flags of various countries were hung high on the platform. A bottle of champagne was tied with five-colored silk ribbons at the bow of the ship.</p>
<p>Guests Attending: In addition to Inspector General Mayers and his wife, those who attended the ceremony yesterday included Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, and his wife, Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs (represented by Section Chief Huang Chuwei), Karnel, Inspector of the Customs Patrol, Forbes, Bailicha, Hu Xiyong, Wang Zhilan, Hong Ruixiang, and Chen Dichun, Deputy Commissioners of Customs, Ding Guitang, Secretary of Customs, Li Du of the Customs Confidential Section, Ba Runsheng of the Audit Section, Chen Xunyong, Commander of the Naval Training Fleet, Zeng Yijing, Director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, Ye Baoqi, Battalion Commander of the Guard Battalion, Chen Zaofan, Deputy Director of the Shipyard, Ye Zaifu, Director of the Shipbuilding Section, Yu Jianfu, Deputy Director, and more than a hundred others. Yu Jianfu served as the chief receptionist. When the bottle-breaking ceremony was held, Battalion Commander Ye Baoqi of the Guard Battalion also dispatched soldiers to guard the area around the platform.</p>
<p>Details of the Launching: At 2:50 PM, all the guests attending the ceremony had arrived. Inspector General Mayers and his wife also boarded the Customs' Jinghui small steamer at that time and landed in front of the general affairs office of the Gaochang Temple shipyard. Chen Zaofan, Deputy Director of the Shipyard, led them to the viewing platform. At 3:00 PM, the bottle-breaking ceremony was held. At that time, Mrs. Mayers held a bouquet of flowers. When the whistle sounded, Mrs. Mayers threw the champagne at the bow of the ship. The bottle broke immediately, and champagne splashed everywhere. The spectators applauded and cheered. The Huaxing patrol ship slowly entered the Huangpu River amid cheers and applause, and was towed by the shipyard's Jiangxin and Jianggeng small steamers and docked at the wharf. The process took about ten minutes.</p>
<p>Champagne Celebration: After the ship was launched, Deputy Director Chen invited the guests to the shipyard's large restaurant for tea, refreshments, and champagne. Deputy Director Chen stood up and gave a speech, saying, "Today is the launching and bottle-breaking ceremony for the Huaxing ship. I am deeply grateful to all of you for gracing us with your presence. The Jianghai Customs has previously commissioned our shipyard to build two patrol ships. These two ships still exist and are in use. The ones we are building now are larger than the previous ones. I hope that these two new ships can eliminate all pirates."</p>
<p>Mayers' Reply: After Deputy Director Chen's speech, Mayers replied on behalf of the guests, saying, "I am very happy to attend the ceremony today and I am grateful for the gifts presented by your director. Pirates are rampant. With the addition of these two ships, they will surely be wiped out. In addition to wishing these two patrol ships well, I also wish your shipyard a prosperous future." At 3:40 PM, they all took their leave, and Mayers and others returned to the Customs on the Jinghui small steamer.</p>
<h3>Photograph of the Launch of the Customs Huaxing Patrol Ship</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of the Ship: The two ships were built simultaneously by the shipyard last year, and the keel was laid on November 25th. The ship is 148 feet long, 26 feet wide, and 13 feet high, with a displacement of 600 tons and a draft of 10 feet. It is worth 1.3 million taels of customs silver. Construction has been underway for seven months, and it has now been largely completed. There are a total of four large and small guns, which are installed by the customs themselves. Half of the materials used in one ship are domestic products. It is scheduled to be completed in full by December of this year.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Navy Department: Yesterday afternoon, the Navy Department specifically telegraphed Deputy Director Chen of the shipyard to inquire about the launching of the Customs ship. Deputy Director Chen replied by telegram, saying, "To Minister Chen of the Nanjing Navy Department, I have received your telegram with respect. The Customs ship was launched today, and Mrs. Mayers, the Inspector General of Customs, broke the bottle. Respectfully replied, Fan bows."</p>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Lines Repaired</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines were bombed by Japanese aircraft after the Shanghai War, and all the automatic long-distance telephone switchboards on the lines were destroyed, resulting in heavy losses. At the same time, branch exchanges at the Maigen Road Station, Fanwangdu Station, Nanxiang Station, and the Xujiahui Station, Xinlonghua Station, and South Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway were also obstructed. The Car Department has notified the Works Department to quickly send staff to install the main switchboard at the North Station first, and then send staff to rush to the above-mentioned stations to carry out repairs. It is now known that the automatic long-distance telephone on the line was connected to all stations on the two lines at 2:45 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Meetings at Various Exchanges　Yesterday, all workers at the following exchanges separately convened meetings to discuss the course of action: (1) Jiangxi Road Central, (2) Fujian Road New Central, (3) Haining Road North, (4) Huishan Road East, (5) Metcalfe Road New West, (6) Baixun Road French South, (7) Mintiniyin Road New French South, (8) Yidingpan Road Sheng Exchange, (9) Yangshupu Warehouse. They resolved to expand their respective disciplinary teams and establish special task forces to strictly prevent violations of discipline.</p>
<p>Strike Order　The Shanghai Telephone Company Strike Committee issued an order stating: "Order for compliance. The committee, due to the lack of sincerity from the company in accepting the conditions previously proposed for our own interests and protection, has been compelled to declare a strike starting at 1 AM on the 8th. All our members are strictly prohibited from going to work at the company from the date of the strike declaration. Obey the discipline and follow orders. This is an important order."</p>
<p>Letter to Electrical Workers　The Strike Committee sent a letter yesterday to all workers of the Chinese Electrical Company stating: "To all workers of the Chinese Electrical Company, since the September 18th Incident, the oppression and exploitation of us telephone workers by the American imperialist telephone capitalists has become even more brutal and cruel. In the past two months, hundreds of our telephone workers have been fired. Now, the capitalists are planning to fire 300 to 400 more people in June and hire White Russians to replace Chinese workers. At the same time, they have also canceled the custom of Sunday pay and annual wage increases in April. Our savings accumulated from years of sweat and blood are often confiscated by the capitalists on various pretexts. The capitalists' crimes of oppressing and exploiting us telephone workers cannot be fully described in words. Now we have declared a general strike. We hope you will express your sympathy with us and not be used by others to work for the telephone company."</p>
<p>Public Statement　The Shanghai Telephone Company issued a statement yesterday regarding the strike, stating: "Since some of the company's Chinese workers went on strike on Tuesday night, there has not been any serious disruption to telephone service. All damages in the Western, Northern, Mintiniyin, and Huishan district exchanges have been temporarily repaired, and telephone service can be maintained as usual. The equipment in the main machine room is also being repaired. The extent of this labor unrest will only be known tomorrow, as today is a public holiday. As for the motivation behind the labor unrest, the company is completely unaware, as the workers did not provide any prior notice of the strike. The company has always been concerned with the welfare of its employees, and employees can always make suggestions to the company. However, since the company completely converted the telephone system to automatic switching, it had to dismiss many engineering personnel and former operators. It is anticipated that this labor unrest is mainly aimed at restoring the jobs of the dismissed workers. However, as there are currently no vacancies in the company, this is difficult to achieve. Moreover, when the automatic switching system was being installed, the company had already issued notices to operators and other workers to seek other employment when each step of the process was about to be completed. If there are any further acts of sabotage that cause congestion in the lines, the public is requested to assist the company in trying to make fewer phone calls."</p>
<h3>Record of the Radio Station's Welcoming and Farewell Gathering</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Transportation held a gathering at Laobeimen the afternoon before yesterday at 5 PM to welcome the station's staff members who participated in the Northeast Volunteer Army to resist Japan and go north, and to welcome the station's staff members who participated in the 19th Route Army to resist Japan and return to Shanghai. They also made iron commemorative medals to distribute to each member, and there were solemn speeches. The details of the grand occasion are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming　The Shanghai Radio Station staff members Li Chuanbin, Xu Anlin, Pan Chengmu, Shi Yifeng, Yan Shanzhi, Wang Ying, etc., who were previously selected to participate in military service, departed to serve in the military radio communications team when the Shanghai war first broke out. When the defense was withdrawn, the team moved to Kunshan. At that time, the communication between Suzhou, Shanghai, Kunshan, and other places relied entirely on the assistance of the radio team. The team also made significant contributions. Later, due to the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the military affairs also came to an end. The members returned to Shanghai one after another. The colleagues at the station admired their bravery, so they specially held a meeting to welcome them and made commemorative medals to distribute to each member.</p>
<p>Farewell　At the same time, the station's staff member Mr. Zhang Xiujue had also participated in the Shanghai war, but at that time, our army had already retreated to Anting, and the fighting was not very intense. After Mr. Zhang returned to Shanghai this time, he deeply regretted not having made efforts in the anti-Japanese war. Upon hearing that there was an organized Northeast Volunteer Army communications team, he joined resolutely despite the difficulties. Mr. Zhang has a grandmother, parents, wife, and daughter. This time when he departed to the north, his family did not hinder him at all. The colleagues at the station were all amazed and impressed. It is reported that Mr. Zhang departed by train early yesterday morning, first to Beiping, and then transferred to various places in Liaoning and Shenyang.</p>
<p>Speeches　The gathering began with a speech by Mr. Zhu Qiqing from the station, followed by reports from the members who participated in the Shanghai war on what had happened. Later, Mr. Zhang gave a speech, roughly saying, "After several obstacles, I was able to achieve my initial goal of participating in the Northeast Volunteer Army, which makes me very happy. I feel even more honored to be able to sacrifice myself in the Northeast for my country's territory. Colleagues, the meaning of your coming to see me off today has at least two points. One point is probably the meaning of admiration, and the other is nothing more than encouragement to me. I hope that those who admire and encourage me will not only admire and encourage me. Before the Japanese imperialists leave the Northeast, I hope my colleagues will follow me. At the time of separation today, I hope even more that in the foreign land of the Northeast, our souls can be reunited like today."</p>
<p>Presentation of Gifts　Finally, Ms. Chen Yizhen, a staff member of the station, distributed commemorative medals to the members who participated in the Songhu War. Since Mr. Zhang was going to the Northeast and it was inconvenient to carry them, the colleagues at the station purchased four items as gifts: a wool blanket, a thermos, a flashlight, and goggles, which were presented by Ms. Chen. The meeting adjourned at 8 PM.</p>
<h3>Ebbing River Tides</h3>
<p>For the past month, the river tides have been rising sharply. Residents along the river are terrified, fearing that the floods of last year will be repeated. However, according to Mr. Xi Dejiong, Director of the Work Relief Department of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, general concerns about rising river levels are actually unfounded. In early June this year, the river levels along the river are not significantly different compared to the river levels at the same time in previous years. Over the past 64 years, the average river level along the river has been 44 feet in Hankou. Last year, the water in Hankou rose to 54 feet, which was a special circumstance and not a reliable basis for predicting water levels. A comparison of recent river levels along the river is listed below:</p>
<p>Date　　Yichang　　Changde　　Jiangyin　　Hankou</p>
<p>May 28　　19.5 feet　　13.6 feet　　24.0 feet　　35.6 feet</p>
<p>May 29　　18.9　　24.3　　25.4　　54.3</p>
<p>May 30　　17.1　　18.7　　25.3　　34.9</p>
<p>May 31　　14.9　　15.8　　　　　　35.1</p>
<p>June 1　　　　　　　　　　35.4</p>
<p>June 2　　　　　　　　　　35.5</p>
<p>June 3　　　　　　　　　　25.5</p>
<p>June 4　　　　　　　　　　35.2</p>
<p>The water in Hankou generally comes from the upper reaches of Yichang, Changde, Xiangyin, and the Han River. Currently, the water level in the upper reaches of the Han River cannot be investigated because it is in the bandit area. The water levels in the other three places have been receding daily and are returning to normal. Hankou should be safe. On June 4, 1921, the water in Hankou rose to 35 feet 12 inches, which is the same height as the water level in Hankou on the same day this year. In 1912, the highest water level in Hankou was 47 feet (on August 10), which did not overflow the river beach. It is expected that the water level this year will not be more severe than it was 11 years ago.</p>

<h3>Tax Police Regiment to Kaizhou to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>The First Regiment of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Police Corps, stationed in the Xinjing Huacao area northwest of Shanghai, recently received an order from the Military Affairs Commission to go to Haizhou to suppress bandits. It is reported that they will travel to Haizhou by waterway. Fearing that they might pass through Wusong and cause misunderstandings with the Japanese army, they have notified the Joint Committee to inform the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>After the War, the Japanese</h3>
<h3>Infringe on Our Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>Negotiations for the Dismissal of Japanese Seamen　The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha in this port, after the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, suspended all of its Yangtze River</p>
<p>ships, and chartered the Dafuku Maru, Daitei Maru, Nanyo Maru, Xiangyang Maru, etc., to the Japanese Navy for transporting troops and military supplies, etc. The seamen used on the ships were originally Chinese stokers, sailors, etc. Later, due to the need for military transport and the need to maintain secrecy, the company, in accordance with the wishes of the naval authorities, dismissed all the Chinese seamen and replaced them with Japanese seamen for more than four months. Now that the Japanese troops in Shanghai are gradually withdrawing, the Navy no longer needs chartered ships, and has lifted the charter agreements for all the Yangtze River ships and returned them to the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha. After receiving these Yangtze River ships, the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha is planning to resume navigation on the Yangtze River. However, the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha has dismissed the Japanese seamen Tsuda Kiyoshi, Nakajima Ichishi, Fukao Koji, etc., 54 in total, who were employed on the Daitei Maru and other ships, and re-hired the original Chinese stokers, sailors, cooks, etc., who have lower wages and work diligently. The group of Japanese seamen expressed opposition to the termination of their contracts and asked Uenoyama Yoshiki, the leader of the Japanese Seamen's Union in Shanghai, to negotiate with President Miri of the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha to fight for jobs on the ships. They insisted that they must continue to serve as seamen and that Chinese seamen should not be rehired. Miri firmly insisted on refusing to hire them. Uenoyama then boarded the Tsukuba Maru and left Shanghai to return to Japan. The Japanese ships will hire</p>
<p>Chinese sailors and others for the resumption of work.</p>
<p>Japanese Fishing Boats Smuggling into Port　In recent years, China's coastal fishing industry has been almost completely taken over by Japanese fishing boats. Last year, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Navy agreed on the boundaries of territorial waters. Foreign fishing boats with a tonnage of more than 200 tons were generally not allowed to enter our territorial waters for fishing. Violators would be seized by the Navy. After this order was announced, the Japanese tried every means to maintain their fishing rights by either changing to Chinese flags or changing the names of their ships. Every year, many Japanese fishing boats fish outside Wusong and transport the fish they catch to Shanghai for sale. Once prohibited, the Japanese were very unwilling. After the outbreak of the January 28th Incident this year, the Japanese fishing industry took advantage of this opportunity to send more fishing boats to fish in our territorial waters outside Wusong. They also violated the prohibitions of the Ministry of Navy and the Ministry of Finance, and continued to come to fish under the protection of their navy. They openly transported and sold their catch in Shanghai. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, Japanese fishing boats such as the Owl Maru, Fukushima Maru, and Xun Maru had already transported 6,000 boxes of fish, as well as 1,200 boxes and 800 boxes, etc., to Shanghai for sale. Since the war, more than 30 Japanese fishing boats, including the Hakuto Maru, Okinawa Maru, Asahi Maru, Mitsuki Maru, Taisei Maru, Toho Maru, Kamo Maru, Daishin Maru, and Akiritsu Maru, have invaded our territorial waters to fish and transported their catch to Shanghai for sale.</p>

<h3>Defence Arguments Against Accusation of Assaulting Guo</h3>
<p>Regarding the case in which Guo Taiqi was assaulted at his residence, the District Attorney of the Second Special District Court, after briefly interrogating the representatives of various organizations' Joint Petition for Rescue Society on the 16th of last month, has remained silent for a long time. Now, lawyers Lu Shaozong and Yu Zhongluo have written a defence argument on behalf of Li Cishan and others, urging a swift resolution. As this case has garnered significant public attention, we have transcribed the document as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of assisting the defendants Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Yang Rongwei, Xie Chengping, Shen Zurong, and others in clarifying the suspicion of obstructing official duties: Upon reviewing the case, the defendants were summoned to court on May 16th for investigation. Luo Wei did not fully explain the suspicion and charges of the crime in accordance with Article 60 of the Criminal Procedure Law. However, the court order was to investigate the incident of Guo Taiqi being assaulted on May 3rd, and the summons stated that the reason for the case was obstructing official duties, which can be inferred as Li Cishan and others being suspected of violating Article 142 of the Criminal Law, hence being summoned for interrogation. As for the victimisation of Guo Taiqi's injury, because he had already expressed his unwillingness to pursue the matter, it is naturally not within the scope of the prosecutor's duty to investigate. Our lawyers requested to review the case files and learned that the investigation of this case originated entirely from the powers of your office, and not from any administrative directives as rumoured. We are sincerely gratified by this respect for the rule of law. What we cannot refrain from saying is that everyone is equal before the law. After being injured, Guo Taiqi sought medical treatment at the hospital. In accordance with Article 94 of the Criminal Procedure Law, it was unobjectionable to interrogate him where he was. However, his family members and servants had no reason not to be brought to the court. Yet, they were interrogated at Guo's residence, preventing the defendants from cross-examining and correcting the erroneous statements of these witnesses, which is regrettable. Furthermore, witnesses Jin Sheng, A Wu, and Xu Aimei, who were interrogated at Guo's residence, were on the summons list for the May 16th interrogation date, but surprisingly failed to appear. Guo Taiqi has long recovered from his injuries and been discharged from the hospital, but has not yet been summoned to court to confront the defendants. What procedures should be followed in litigation law? Your office can naturally dispose of this matter in accordance with the law. For now, we will set it aside and only explain the reasons why Li Cishan and others have no criminal suspicion in this incident, for your careful consideration.</p>
<p>(1) According to Guo Taiqi's own statement, the report written by Guo Xu Dequan, and the translated report from the French Concession Police Affairs Director Salri, the four defendants Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Yang Rongwei, and Xie Chengping arrived between 8:00 and 8:30 AM. Because Guo was delayed by his bath, it was between 9:00 and 9:30 AM when he received them, as seen in Jin Sheng's testimony and the translated report from Salri. This means that Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie waited at Guo's residence for nearly an hour before being received. If Guo Taiqi had not been delayed by his bath that day, he would have finished his conversation with Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie before Shen Zurong arrived to request an audience. There would have been no opportunity for him to meet with those who came later, and how could an assault have occurred due to the crowd? Whether Guo bathes every morning is something that Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie could not have known. The fact that the request for an audience coincided with his bath and required an hour of waiting before they could be seen was also something that Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie could not have foreseen. To say that they were organised, arranged for thugs to arrive in advance, and carried out the assault an hour later is an unreasonable and harsh argument. By examining the point that the waiting time for Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie to be received was not expected, it can be seen that those who rushed in and committed the assault when Guo received Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie were all coincidentally gathered. Their actions had no causal connection with the request for an audience by the four defendants Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie, and their responsibility is naturally not related to Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie.</p>
<p>(2) Although Shen Zurong happened to meet with the second group of people who arrived later and requested an audience at the same time, he first presented his calling card when requesting the audience, behaving politely, just like Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie who had been notified in advance. If he had come to carry out an assault or had conspired with others who came with him, he would not have deliberately left traces, waiting to be summoned and arrested afterwards. Moreover, after Shen Zurong was admitted, there were several more groups of people who arrived whose names were unknown. According to the police report, while Guo was talking, suddenly more than twenty young students entered Mr. Guo's reception room, shouting "Down with Guo Taiqi!" One person grabbed a teacup and threw it. This clearly proves that these twenty or so young students did not come to see Guo at the same time as Shen Zurong. Even if those who injured Guo could be said to have come from these suddenly arriving twenty or so young students, there is no clue as to who summoned these twenty or so young students. How can anyone arbitrarily fabricate a charge and make Shen Zurong, who did not seek an audience at the same time as these twenty or so young students, bear the responsibility of conspiracy?</p>
<p>(3) After Guo Taiqi was injured by an unknown person on May 3rd, the crowd scattered like birds and beasts. Only the defendants Li, Yin, Yang, Xie, Shen, and a few journalists remained. The reason why they did not leave Guo's residence immediately was that the journalists wanted to know the condition of Guo Taiqi after the injury, while the defendants Li, Yin, Yang, Xie, and Shen, out of public duty and private friendship, should sincerely express their condolences. Moreover, they were candid and did not want to rush away to avoid suspicion. If the incident had been a conspiracy, they would have fled with the crowd, let alone sit and wait for the police to investigate. Therefore, when the foreign advisor Xia Qifeng telegraphed the situation to the police, and they dispatched the Fuxu police reserve team to Guo's residence, all the perpetrators had already fled in a hurry (see Salri's report). Although the defendants were ordered to go to the police station for interrogation, they were not initially identified by Guo as suspects. Li Cishan and Yin Zhiling were even bailed out by Guo Taiqi after discussing it with Xia Qifeng, which shows that Guo Taiqi, based on what he personally witnessed at the time, had no reason to suspect Li, Yin, and others. Afterwards, based on the fabricated rumours of his family and servants, he changed his candid attitude, lost sight of the truth due to suspicion, and mistakenly believed that the perpetrators had some organization beforehand. He did not know that among the hundreds of people, both known and unknown, who were sitting and standing crowded inside and outside the room at the time when Guo was attacked, Guo's niece Xu Aimei stated that the room was full of thirty or forty people, while Guo Taiqi himself stated that only four or five people actually committed the assault, one of whom threw a teacup, and the rest only threw copper coins. If it is said that they had an organization beforehand and firmly believed that Guo Taiqi was a henchman who was selling out the country, intending to punish him and prevent the signing of a traitorous agreement, then with a crowd of thirty, forty, or even hundreds of people, a single shout of encouragement would have been enough to crush Guo Taiqi and end his life. Why would they only have one person throw a teacup, and three or four people throw copper coins, injuring his forehead and then fleeing? Therefore, based on the condition of Guo's injuries, it can be determined not only that the five defendants Li, Yin, Yang, Xie, and Shen did not participate in the incident, but also that the four or five unknown perpetrators who fled were also driven by a momentary sense of indignation at the scene, acting on an impulse that could not be controlled by reason, without any prior planning. Guo collected two or three hundred copper coins after the incident, and because the copper coins were all wrapped in paper, he hastily considered it evidence of prior organization, which is short-sighted and laughable. (4) After reviewing the investigation of this case, according to the statements of Guo Taiqi himself and his family and servants, the following are the only things that may cause the five defendants Li, Yin, Yang, Xie, and Shen to be suspected: (1) Each witness stated that among the four representatives who came in first, one wearing a Zhongshan suit went out and waved, calling in many people (see Jin Sheng's, Xu Aimei's, and Guo Taiqi's statements, and the report written by Guo Xu Dequan); and (2) Guo Taiqi stated, "The old woman A Wu and my wife's niece saw Shen Zurong scolding loudly outside and instructing these perpetrators to flee." Now, we will refute each of these statements separately. (1) Upon investigation, Jin Sheng's and Xu Aimei's statements did not specify the name of the person wearing a Zhongshan suit among the four representatives who came in first. However, according to Guo Taiqi's own statement, "I only know the four representatives who came in first," then the names of the four representatives should be known to Guo. Since Guo witnessed who among the four representatives was wearing a Zhongshan suit, he should have been able to name the person wearing the Zhongshan suit. Why is he still hesitating and uncertain? Guo Taiqi has not yet clearly identified which of the four representatives Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie was wearing a Zhongshan suit. Therefore, he cannot believe that it is true because his family and servants have this rumour. Moreover, Jin Sheng stated, "The person wearing a Zhongshan suit called people in from outside," and Xu Aimei stated, "Mrs. Guo saw the person wearing a Zhongshan suit go out and call many people in." Both statements are affirmative. However, Guo's wife Xu Dequan's handwritten report only stated, "And saw a young man wearing a Zhongshan suit in the room wanting to go outside, seeming to be calling for people." It is still in the area of uncertain suspicion. Compared with the affirmative statements of Xu Aimei and others, it is also evident that there is some agreement and contradiction between them. To say that the four defendants Li, Yin, Yang, and Xie are suspected of being involved in the assault on Guo based on this, the suspicion is also extremely weak. What benefit will it bring to the public prosecution after the accusation? (2) From a textual perspective, Guo Taiqi himself stated that "The old woman A Wu and my wife's niece saw Shen Zurong scolding loudly outside and instructing the perpetrators to flee," it seems that Shen Zurong is highly suspected of being involved in the assault on Guo. However, Guo did not personally witness Shen Zurong's "loud scolding" and "instructing the perpetrators to flee." A Wu originally stated, "I only saw a man in his forties with a beard wearing a long gown scolding outside," and Xu Aimei also originally stated, "Saw a man with a beard about forty years old scolding something about a traitor outside." Neither of them specified that the person scolding was Shen Zurong, and they have clearly identified the person's age and appearance, old and with a beard, which does not match the young and beardless Shen Zurong who is now being summoned to court. How can Guo Taiqi arbitrarily conclude that the person is Shen Zurong based on this rumour? What is even more strange is that Guo's wife Xu Dequan's report even mentions a so-called long-bearded old man Shen Zurong twice, saying, "Mrs. Guo heard that a guest had come and went downstairs to check, and saw the long-bearded old man Shen Zurong also waiting in the room," and "And saw the long-bearded old man Shen Zurong fleeing in panic from the guest room, shouting slogans 'Traitors, kill you!'" This is a fact that Guo's wife Xu Dequan personally witnessed and wrote down, and she should be responsible for her words under the law and should not blame it on mistakes. However, in terms of reason, having already fled in panic, he should not shout slogans again. Guo's wife Xu Dequan stated that the slogans she heard were "Traitors" and "Kill you," while Xu Aimei stated that the scolding she heard was "Traitor." At the same time and place, the observations of the same person are inconsistent. Shen Zurong does not have the ability to transform and change his appearance. To add the four words "long-bearded old man" to Shen Zurong's name, how can it not be said that it was a deliberate fabrication of crimes due to visual impairment or intentional exaggeration afterwards? The above are all detailed defences on the facts that the defendants are suspected of being involved. It can already be concluded that the suspicion is insufficient. In accordance with Article 244 and the second doubt of the Criminal Procedure Law, a decision not to prosecute should be made. Although there is a fact that Guo Taiqi was assaulted, he was not performing his duties at the time, and his signing of the May 5th Agreement is legally questionable. The public's patriotic fervour to prevent the authorities from selling out the country should not be equated with a crime. The legal opinions have been elaborated in detail by lawyer Zhao Chen, the co-defender in this case, in a separate defence argument. Our lawyer believes that the legal opinions are all defensive arguments made in retrospect. The investigation on the facts of this case has not obtained sufficient evidence that the five defendants Li, Yin, Yang, Xie, and Shen conspired and participated in the assault on Guo. There is no need to discuss it in advance. Therefore, although we agree with lawyer Zhao Chen's defence argument, we still hope that your office will directly terminate the investigation with a decision not to prosecute based on the reason that no evidence of suspicion has been found in fact, so as to avoid innocent people from being burdened by litigation.

<h3>Hosts Banquet for All Overseas Chinese Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Volunteer Corps Report on Combat Experiences</p>
<p>The Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Association held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in its building to welcome the Golden Body Overseas Chinese Volunteer Corps, which participated in the frontline combat. In addition to more than 30 members of the Volunteer Corps, there were also Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu, Song Sheng, and members Chen Zimi, etc., totalling over 200 people, accompanying them. Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu presided over the meeting, with Zhou Xiuquan as the secretary. After performing the ceremony, Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu delivered a welcoming speech, stating that the members of the corps, in order to fulfil their responsibilities as masters of the Republic of China, returned to the country to participate in the Battle of Shanghai. This spirit of disregarding life and death to seek survival for the nation is truly admirable. Now that the members of the corps have successfully completed their mission and are returning south, passing through Shanghai, this association, in addition to admiration, has prepared refreshments to welcome you. The journey ahead is long, and we wish you all the best. Next, the representative of the Volunteer Corps, Lin Jingxiong, reported on the combat experiences of this operation. Then, standing committee member Zhou Songsheng, members Wang Bannong, Guo Qiming, Chen Yifeng, etc., delivered speeches in succession. Finally, they shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Association Comforts Wang and Chen</h3>
<p>The violent Japanese destroyed peace and invaded Shanghai. Shanghai citizens, driven by righteousness and patriotism, formed volunteer armies to participate in the anti-Japanese work. Wang Pingnan, a legal advisor of the Shanghai Citizens Promoting National Goods Association, served as the battalion commander, and Chen Binghui, a member of the 12th Standing Committee, served as the transport and battalion commander. They led the entire army, under the command of Brigade Commander Weng Zhaohui of the 158th Brigade, bravely fought the enemy, endured the hardships of camping in the open air, faced the dangers of gunfire and bullets, and fought bravely for more than a month, making many contributions. Their courage and determination, and their spirit of defending the country, were deeply respected by all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, and were admired by the citizens of Shanghai and the national goods industry. Now that Wang and Chen have successfully completed their mission, returned to Shanghai after being relieved of their duties, the association, in conjunction with the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, has scheduled to hold a comfort meeting at 2:00 PM this afternoon (9th) in the auditorium of the association's office in Nine Acres Land, in order to comfort their difficult and arduous spirit of serving the country and leading the people to resist Japan, and to invite the two comrades to report on their personal experiences of resisting Japan, so as to broaden their knowledge. The association's secretarial office has sent letters to the affiliated factories, dispatching personnel to participate, and it is expected that there will be a warm and grand occasion at that time.</p>

<h3>Shipping News</h3>
<p>Hengshan Escapes Danger The Hengshan vessel of the Sanbei Company was chartered by the Soviet Russian Commercial Fleet to operate in the Vladivostok area. In late last month, the vessel was sailing in the Korean waters near Jeju Island when it suddenly encountered dense fog. The vessel mistakenly ran aground on a reef in the fog, and the first two cabins were broken, causing seawater to rush into the cabins, damaging the cargo. The situation was quite dangerous at the time. The shipowner urgently telegraphed the Osaka Salvage Company in Japan to send a vessel for towing and rescue. Yesterday, they received a telegram saying that after the rescue vessel arrived at the scene, they first repaired the holes and then filled them with cement. Then, they pumped out the accumulated water. The ship has now escaped danger and has been towed to Nagasaki, Japan, where it has entered the dock for major repairs. It is expected to be completed in about two weeks. The loss from this accident is about 40,000 taels.</p>
<p>Recent Transportation News The 19th Route Army was ordered to enter Fujian to suppress the communists. The Ministry of Military Administration telegraphed Shanghai, calling for China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, Jiahe, Wanxiang, Songpu, Tunan, Yongxing, and other eleven vessels to transport the army to Fujian. The first batch to depart was Mao's 61st Division, which went directly to Quanzhou and Xinghua in Fujian to be stationed separately. Yesterday, news was received in Shanghai that the entire Mao Division had arrived in Quanzhou on the 6th and was currently disembarking. The vessels will return to Nanjing immediately to transport the 60th and 78th Divisions to Xiamen and other places. The transportation period is limited to 30 days for loading.</p>
<p>Commercial School Opens The Wusong Merchant Marine School of the Ministry of Communications, since the Ministry of Communications appointed Xia Sunpeng as the school principal, has been greatly damaged by the destruction of the Paotaiwan school building, and it cannot be used without major repairs. It has now temporarily rented the Albert Road Albert Lane in the French Concession of Shanghai as a temporary school building, and is also repairing the original school at the same time. All the details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now heard that the school has opened on May 28th, and classes officially started on the 6th of this month. Students from far and near, with the resumption of singing and learning, have flocked to the school. The school's facilities are also being gradually completed.

The future of the school is indeed gratifying. It is also heard that there are concrete plans for the administrative aspects, which are being submitted to the ministry for instructions. As soon as the repairs to the Paotaiwan school building are completed, it will be moved back to the original site.</p>
<h3>Native Cloth Exhibition</h3>
<p>The exhibition begins its tour today</p>
<p>The native cloth exhibition organised by Shanghai County Farmers' Education Centre, which will be exhibited at Shanghai Teenagers' Propaganda Group on the 18th and 19th of this month, held its opening ceremony on the 1st of this month at the Zhuanqiao Farmers' Education Centre, as we have previously reported. It is now known that a week has passed since the opening ceremony, and tens of thousands of people have visited and purchased cloth every day, showing the enthusiasm of Chinese people for promoting domestic goods. However, due to the short preparation time for this exhibition, there are only over 1,000 types of native cloth. The quality of the cloth, its durability, is praised by all viewers. Among them, there is a type of white cloth woven by an old woman over 70 years old, which shows the hard work of the rural people. The association will tour various districts for exhibition starting today (8th). The exhibition will be held at the Shanghai Teenagers' Propaganda Group on the 18th and 19th of this month. The tour locations and dates are recorded as follows: Minhang, June 8th and 9th; Maqiao, June 10th and 11th; Beiqiao, June 12th and 13th; Tangwan, June 14th and 15th; Sanlin, June 16th and 17th; Shanghai, June 18th and 19th. The exhibition time is from 7:00 AM to 11:40 AM and from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. At each location, a publicity meeting will be held on the first day, inviting local leaders to participate, in order to spread the word and increase efficiency. In addition, the association has a sales department to sell various native cloths. Private firms can also be established with the approval of the association.</p>
<h3>National Exhibition Summer Products Sell Well</h3>
<p>The National Exhibition organised by the Shanghai Tianhougong Bridge Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been thriving since its opening, and can be described as unprecedented. Now, the factories and shops participating in the exhibition, due to the arrival of Mengxia season and the hot weather, are offering seasonal goods at low prices, such as Huahua Store's cosmetics, Renchangyong's scientific instruments, Huafu Factory's straw hats, Xinghua Factory's bamboo products, Peide's ties, Zhenhua Factory's pottery, Ruixing Factory's sanitary incense, Senlin Factory's rattan willow products, etc., with exceptionally strong sales. As for Watson's soda and Yicheng's beer, there are too many customers to serve, which proves that most compatriots have gradually embarked on the path of promoting domestic goods.</p>
<h3>Fike Escapes Danger and Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Evening News reports that Fike, the captain of gasoline tanker No. 2 of Jiejiang Co, who was kidnapped by the communist bandits in the Yangtze River on January 15, was rescued by the Water Disaster Relief Committee and released on May 31. He arrived in Shanghai by the Poyang ship this morning (8th). Mr. Fike is 68 years old and will return to his hometown in California soon. It is said that he was treated well by the bandits, but due to improper diet, he has lost 20 pounds. In addition, the two Chinese engineers of the dyke project, who were also captured by the bandits, are now being held by the bandits. The bandits are now demanding medicines worth 1000 big dollars, another 1000 dollars in banknotes, five telephones, and 30 tons of flour in exchange for their release. When they left the bandits' lair, the flour had been transported in, and it is expected that the two men will be released soon.</p>
<h3>Wang Yansong Discusses the National Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>New Voice Society reports that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and four other groups have initiated the organization of a National Goods Exhibition, as has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Mr. Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the association, made the following statement yesterday regarding this matter: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and others initiated this National Goods Exhibition out of concern for the overwhelming influx of foreign goods, the continuous outflow of money, the increasing impoverishment of the people, and the weakening of the nation. They feel compelled to exert their utmost efforts and loudly appeal to attract attention from all parties. The advocacy of national goods in our country has been ongoing for quite some time, and the National Government has even listed the promotion of national goods as one of the seven major tasks of local autonomy. However, while the advocacy seems enthusiastic, the actual results are quite limited. Looking at the situation of Sino-foreign trade, since the opening of the sea routes, except for the six years before 1877 when there was a slight surplus, there has been a long-term trade deficit since 1877. In the year before last (1930), the trade deficit was over 414.9 million taels, which caused widespread alarm, considering it unprecedented and perhaps unsurpassable. However, it is not known that last year's total import value was 1,427,574,000 taels, and the total export value was 887,450,000 taels, with the huge trade deficit reaching over 540 million taels, equivalent to over 750 million foreign dollars. If this continues, how can the people survive, and how can the nation stand? Tracing the cause, the unsoundness of politics and the instability of society, leading to the shaking of property and the decline of industry, are certainly among the root causes. However, the people's rejection of national goods and preference for foreign goods cannot be denied. If the people could all use national goods, then, on the positive side, even if it is difficult to increase the value of exports in a short time, on the negative side, the value of imports would never jump to over 887 million taels in a year, exceeding the export value by over 540 million taels. In my humble opinion, the first way to remedy this is that the entire nation must have a thorough awakening and a great determination. Everyone must economize on clothing and food, and be diligent and thrifty. Whatever national goods can replace, no matter what, national goods must be purchased and used, and this must be maintained for a long time without being fickle. Moreover, people in the government and leaders from all walks of life should set an example and take the lead in promoting national goods. At the opening of this National Goods Exhibition, someone wearing a foreign-made suit gave a speech on stage, giving the audience a very bad impression. This is an example of how social leaders fail to take the lead in sincerely promoting national goods. In addition, schools currently consume a large quantity of foreign goods, and teachers and students, because of their cunning, wear foreign-made suits, which further promotes the sale of large quantities of cotton and woolen goods by foreigners. Furthermore, industrialists and businessmen, who are most affected by the oppression of foreign goods, should especially love and use national goods. However, according to general observations, their use is limited to the products of their own industry, and for other items they use, they still only buy foreign goods. If the intellectual class and industrialists and businessmen are so indifferent to national goods, what else can be said? It is no wonder that people talk about promoting national goods and resisting foreign goods every day, but the import of foreign goods continues to break past records year after year. Learning from the past and preventing future mistakes, we can only hope that the production society and the consumption society can have a thorough awakening and a great determination. Producers should work hard to manufacture, consumers should try to buy, and we also hope that leaders from all walks of life will lead by example to improve social customs and reverse the declining trend, and so on.</p>
<h3>Mr. Burgess of the United States Passes Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. P. Burgess, President of the United States Wood Memorial Foundation, set off from the United States to the Philippines to give lectures and investigate leprosy relief affairs. He passed through Shanghai on the 6th and the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association specially held a banquet at the Bankers' Association at 7 pm that evening to welcome him. Mr. Kuang Fuzhuo and Mr. Gao Mingqiang warmly hosted him. Those who attended to accompany him included Wu Liande, Ding Shujing, Diao Xinde, Cheng Lian, Chen Hongkang, Sheng Qingcheng, Chen Wenying, Mrs. Xiao Zhiji, Mrs. Yan Fuqing, Mrs. Zheng Yangxiu, and other 20 people. While the wine was still flowing, a sound film brought by Mr. Burgess about the Culion Leprosarium in the Philippines was screened. The beautiful scenery and daily life of the hospital, such as diagnosis and treatment, entertainment, sports, etc., were all included in a total of seven reels, which were greatly appreciated by the viewers. After the screening, Mr. Burgess was invited to give a speech, and Mr. Kuang Fuzhuo thanked him before everyone dispersed. It is said that Mr. Burgess only stayed in Shanghai for one night and took the original ship to the Philippines the next morning.</p>
<h3>Shipping Association Writes to the Customs</h3>
<p>Regarding the difficulty of stamping voyage logs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association has encountered difficulties in stamping the voyage logs of ships sailing in the inner harbor. It wrote to Mr. Luo, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, yesterday, stating: "Sir, according to a letter from the Shensha Shipping United Bureau, which is jointly formed by members Dada Shipping Company, Ping'an Shipping Company, Xingshang Shipping Company, Yuxing Shipping Company, Xinlong Shipping Company, Jufeng Shipping Company, and Jufeng Baoji Shipping Company, we read in the newspaper that the joint announcement by the Customs Superintendent and the Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs stated that the internal harbor licenses and river licenses issued by the Customs to Chinese merchant ships will be discontinued from June 1st according to government orders. From that date, when Chinese merchant ships clear customs at treaty ports, the ship's agent or captain should prepare a customs clearance application form, clearly stating the ship's destination, route, and the regulations under which it operates (general shipping regulations, internal harbor shipping regulations, or Yangtze River shipping regulations) and submit it to the Customs for verification. In addition, all Chinese merchant ships should have a voyage log to record where the ship cleared customs, the destination, and all other itinerary matters. All detailed measures regarding this new regulation can be inquired from the General Affairs Section of the Customs." Upon receiving this, we immediately consulted Director Hu of the Jianghai Branch Customs, who indicated that the voyage log should be stamped by the branch customs at each port that the ship passes through or arrives at. If there is no branch customs, it should be stamped by a public institution, and if there is no public institution, it can be stamped by the local chamber of commerce. Our companies' ships operate along the ports in the three counties of Shanghai, Chongming, Haimen, and Qidong. There are 16 to 17 ports that they pass through on the same day, and none of them have branch customs. The county governments, public institutions, and chambers of commerce in Chongming, Haimen, and Qidong are quite far from the ports, with the closest being more than 15 or 16 li away. When the ship arrives at a port, it only stops for a few minutes to pick up and drop off passengers and cargo. Therefore, it is practically impossible to have the voyage log stamped by the public institution or chamber of commerce in each port, as the distance is long and the time is short. Therefore, we are writing to the association to forward a letter to the Customs Superintendent and Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, requesting special consideration for our bureau's ships and exempting them from stamping to facilitate travelers and alleviate the burden on shipping companies. We are deeply grateful and await your instructions." In addition, members Dada Shipping Company and Datong Renji Shipping Company, which operate on the Tongyang route, have stated similar situations. The Shensha route, which operates from Shanghai to Chongming, Haimen, Qidong, and other counties, and the Hutongyang route, which operates from Shanghai to Nantong, Taizhou, Yangzhou, and other places, each pass through no less than 10 or 20 ports. When the ships pass through these ports, they only stop for a few minutes or 10 to 20 minutes. There are no docks or pontoons to moor alongside, nor are they inlets. Passengers disembark and embark and a small amount of cargo is loaded and unloaded by sampans. The ships arrive and depart without delay. Each port is more than 10 li or dozens of li away from the city, and the county government, public institution, or chamber of commerce is located in the city, so far from the port where the ship temporarily stops. It is practically impossible to order the ship to travel more than 10 li or dozens of li in a matter of minutes or 10 to 20 minutes to request a stamp. The companies' claims are indeed factual. Therefore, we are writing to request that the Jianghai Branch Customs be instructed that, except for the final destination or places where there are branch customs, which should be stamped on the voyage log, all other ports along the way where stamping is practically impossible should be exempted from stamping to conform to the facts and facilitate convenience. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>Appeal from the Sauce and Wine Industry</h3>
<p>A letter to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sauce and Wine Industry Association sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "We are writing regarding the unauthorized alteration of the tax system by seizing goods. We respectfully request that you quickly order the return of the seized goods, correct the tax system, and maintain government orders. It has come to our attention that a member, Zhihe Hao, reported that Lin Xitao, the director of the Shanghai Local Yellow Wine Collection Branch of the Jiangsu Second District Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Bureau, under the pretext of inspecting licenses on November 15th of last year, unreasonably seized 51 urns of yellow wine and illegally detained the shop owner, Fan Xiasheng. Moreover, the seized wine had stamps affixed according to regulations and there was no tax evasion. Since the seizure, several months have passed without the goods being returned or any punishment being imposed. This is an extreme example of violating the law and disturbing merchants. We request that you negotiate for the return of the goods and forward the matter to higher authorities for strict investigation. Furthermore, dozens of firms, including Fengtai and others, jointly stated that since Lin Xitao took over the Shanghai Local Yellow Wine Collection Branch, he unilaterally changed the weight of each urn from 40 jin to 45 jin, as announced by the Ministry of Finance, falsely claiming that it was approved by higher authorities, resulting in a significant loss to the industry. We request that you submit this to the Ministry of Finance for correction." The association convened a meeting of members and discussed the matter repeatedly. The members were indignant and said that the director unreasonably seized goods and even detained merchants for a long time without returning the goods. There was no formal seizure procedure beforehand, and no punishment of the merchants was carried out according to regulations afterward. Merchants are all law-abiding citizens. Seizing their goods and detaining the shop owner is no different from treating them as heinous criminals. Has the Zhihe branch owner, Fan Xiasheng, actually violated regulations and evaded taxes? No clear announcement has been made. This is clearly an abuse of power and a violation of the law that disturbs merchants. If this is not strictly investigated, how can merchants be secure in their business and how can others be deterred from following suit? Furthermore, the weight of 40 jin per urn announced by the Ministry of Finance has been followed since the establishment of the monopoly tax, and wine merchants have unanimously complied. Even previous officials in charge of the local yellow wine monopoly tax did not dare to change it arbitrarily. Now, the director is manipulating things, falsely claiming that he has reported to higher authorities for approval. The tax system announced by the Ministry of Finance has gone through legal procedures and is consistent throughout the country. How can it be arbitrarily changed? There is absolutely no such bad example. This not only deceives merchants but also has the suspicion of soliciting for private gain. It should be submitted to the competent authority for strict investigation and punishment." It was decided to submit the matter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and telegraph the Ministry for a thorough investigation. However, no reply has been received to date, and the members are panicking and questioning the association. Therefore, we are writing again to respectfully request that you quickly approve the order and first return the seized goods to prevent further losses to the merchants. All illegal parts, such as the unauthorized alteration of the tax system, should be investigated, corrected, and punished accordingly to secure commerce and maintain government orders. We are extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to Minister Song of the Central Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Picking Up Firewood and Finding a Bomb</h3>
<p>A scavenger dies a tragic death</p>
<p>Yesterday at 11:25 am, Chen Jiamo, a 46-year-old man from Jiangbei who lived by scavenging, was picking up old firewood in the water near the Jin Sheng Road Pier in Yangshupu, next to the Yihua Yarn Factory. He then found an object on the beach. Chen took it in his hand and looked at it, but somehow it suddenly exploded, with a loud bang that shook the vicinity. Chen's abdomen was blown open, his internal organs flowed out, both hands were blown off, both legs were pulverized, one eye was blinded, and dozens of small holes were blasted all over his body. The flesh was blurred and horrific to behold. Chen fell to the ground and died instantly. His son, Dingyou, who was picking up firewood nearby, heard the loud noise and came over, saw Chen blown up on the beach, and reported it to the Customs Water Police Station. The police sent officers to take Chen's body to the police station, inquired about the cause of death, and then ordered detective Xue Silin to take the witnesses Song Ali and the deceased's brother Chen Jiacang and son Dingyou and Dingyu to transport the body to the autopsy station of the Nanshi Rescue Bureau and report to the local court for inspection. The explosive was extremely violent and destroyed two or three zhang of the cement dam on the beach. It is believed that it was a bomb abandoned by the Japanese.</p>

They were all ordered to be remanded in custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Detective Accompanies Young Girl</h3>
<p>Visiting and Investigating the Address of Seduction and Cohabitation</p>
<p>Searching All Over, It Was Finally Found</p>
<p>The Seducer Is a Gatekeeper Policeman</p>
<p>Wang A'mei, a 17-year-old female worker from Suzhou at the Tongyi Yarn Factory, was lured by the sweet words of an old woman, Shen Fu, who lived at No. 265 Macau Road, and on the 23rd of last month, she went to the French Concession with the old woman to stay with Wang Zuofa from Zhejiang in a small inn. Later, they rented a house to live in at No. 447 Avenue du Père Froc, lasting for half a month. A few days ago, Wang took the opportunity to escape back north. After being questioned by her parents, she reported the case to the Xinzha Police Station, who arrested the old woman, Sun Fu, and sent her to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Detective Yuan Xinzhong was also assigned to investigate and thoroughly investigate Wang Zuofa, who had committed the seduction. However, Wang A'mei was a young girl who was not familiar with the roads in Shanghai. She could not even name the place where she lived. Yesterday, Detective Yuan took Wang A'mei in a car to visit and investigate the address of cohabitation in various places in the French Concession. When they passed in front of No. 447 Avenue du Père Froc, the girl suddenly felt that this was a familiar place. She led Detective Wang into the house at No. 447, where Wang was still present and was immediately arrested. It was 3 pm, and Wang was sent to the First Court of the Special District yesterday. The police lawyer described the case, and Judge Feng Shide interrogated the defendant, who claimed that he was currently a gatekeeper policeman. Wang A'mei was introduced by Shen Fu. They first stayed in a hotel and then lived together. However, at that time, Wang A'mei voluntarily followed him to live with him, and he had bought her four new cheongsams, one of which was still being sewn by a tailor. As for her age, he had never asked. As this case was initially obtained, Shen Fu will continue to be tried this morning. The police lawyer requested to combine the cases for interrogation today, and Judge Feng approved.</p>
<h3>Traveler Dies by Poisoning</h3>
<p>In a small inn at No. 727 Qipu Road, there was a traveler who called himself Yao A'er, 20 years old. Yesterday at 0:40 pm, the waiter saw that he had not yet gotten up and called out several times outside the door, but there was no response. He then managed to pry open the door and saw that he was dizzy and lying stiff on the bed. He also found a small amount of opium residue and a suicide note, knowing that he had taken poison. He immediately reported it to the Hui Si Police Station, who sent him to Renji Hospital by car, but he died despite the treatment. The hospital moved the body to the autopsy station for examination.</p>
<h3>Two Drowning Deaths in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Liu Chengbao and Anhui woman Song Liu, 28 years old, made a living ferrying boats at the Xiangjia Pier. Yesterday afternoon at about 2:00 pm, the woman drove her boat to the San Tai Pier in Nanshi, intending to dock. Suddenly, a boat carrying bran sped out from Xiangdang and accidentally collided with the bow of the woman's boat. With a loud bang, the entire boat shook. Liu Chengbao, the woman’s younger brother, lost his footing and fell into the Huangpu River. At the time of the rising tide, Liu fell into the river and drowned under the bran boat. Although efforts were made to rescue him, he had already died. The woman was furious and twisted the boss of the bran boat, Chen Zhangxiang from Pudong, to the Nanshi Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team to request a thorough investigation. Under the preliminary trial by Captain Liang, because the incident involved human life, he immediately dispatched police to the scene of the incident to conduct a detailed investigation and refer it to Feng for handling.</p>
<p>Xiao Haihuizi. Xu Baoxing, a barge household, had a son named Xiao Haihuizi, who was 13 years old. Yesterday morning at about 8:00 am, Xu had important matters and pushed the boat out, heading from east to west. When passing the Huangpu River near the Caojiadu Gongyi Oil Factory in Husi, a kiln cargo boat sped from west to east, intending to block the boat. Dai Dianyuan, a boatman, accidentally inserted the bamboo pole into Xu's boat, and Xiao Haihuizi, who was standing on the boat at the time, was swept out by the bamboo pole, causing him to fall into the Huangpu River. Because of the rapid tide, he could not be rescued and drowned. Xu immediately twisted Dai together with the boat owner Zhou Yingui and others into the Caojiadu Police Station of the Second Branch of the Water Patrol Team. The branch sent the people to the Nanshi General Team to ask for verification.</p>

Suddenly, black smoke was like ink, and sparks flew everywhere. Later, the fire brigade drove pump trucks to put out the fire, which was extinguished in about half an hour. It is estimated that the loss of machinery and cotton is more than a thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Case of a Child Bride Being Defiled</h3>
<p>Xie Changhai Will Be Difficult to Escape Punishment</p>
<p>Witness Testimony Conflicts With Confessions</p>
<p>Final Argument on Appeal Awaits Pronouncement</p>
<p>Zhou Jindi, the 17-year-old child bride of Zhang Hongcai, a man from Jiangbei, originally worked at the Japanese-owned Yufeng Yarn Factory. Suddenly, on January 30th, she disappeared. At that time, the Sino-Japanese war was extremely fierce, and it was impossible to find her. After several days, the girl was found in Zhabei, looking like she had epilepsy. Her father-in-law took her home and healed her. When asked about the reason for her disappearance, she said that she was abducted by Xie Changhai and two accomplices to a certain place and raped for three nights, and then abandoned, causing her to suffer from a mental illness. Zhang then reported the case to the police, who arrested Xie and sent him to the First Special District Court, where he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Xie was dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. During the court hearing, Xie firmly stated that on the day Zhou disappeared, he was still working at a noodle stall in the Yufeng factory and that he also stayed there at night. The judge then ordered the police to summon the noodle stall owner to court for questioning. Yesterday afternoon, the court continued the hearing. The noodle stall owner testified that Xie had worked at the stall for a week seven or eight years ago, and had not seen him since. He was no longer very familiar with him, and he did not know anything about the circumstances of the crime. Judge Yu based his testimony on the fact that the case was clear and ordered the lawyers on both sides to begin their arguments. First, the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu spoke, saying that based on the testimony of the witness who came to court, it was clear that the appellant's confession was not credible and should be rejected on appeal and executed according to the original judgment. Next, Xie's lawyer Yan Luqing defended, saying that according to physiology, a girl of 16 is fully developed, and even if she is raped for three nights in a row, she should not suffer from mental illness. Moreover, the victim is physically strong, while the appellant is weak. It can be inferred that the reason for Zhou Jindi's mental illness was caused by being raped for three nights by two fugitives. And since she was mentally ill, she could not recall who was raping her at the time. Only because she saw that the appellant had mediated afterward, she pointed to Xie as the rapist in order to deal with her father-in-law's questioning. This may also be the case and should be carefully examined and the original judgment reversed, and so on. The court immediately announced the end of the arguments. Xie Changhai was returned to custody to await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Record of the Shareholders' Meeting of the Huiquan Aerated Water Factory</h3>
<p>The Huiquan Aerated Water Factory, known for producing champagne beer, which sells well in Siam and Sumatra, now, because domestic people are accustomed to bitter tastes, is launching a new type of natural beer. With the assistance of Yun Jibi's deviousness, a shareholders' meeting was held yesterday at the Central Restaurant in Shanghai. The most famous type of beer was provided for drinking at the same time, and everyone was asked to taste and comment. As a result, they unanimously praised the natural beer, saying its bitter-sweet taste was like the "Jian Guo" fruit, enough to awaken one from intoxication, making people remember it with every meal. It was then decided to manufacture and distribute it in large quantities. All the company's articles of association have been revised in accordance with the newly promulgated Company Law, and other matters were discussed and resolved, and reported to the Ministry for record in accordance with the law. Furthermore, because the factory's products, such as beer and champagne, are extremely suitable as gifts for weddings, birthdays, funerals, and sacrificial rites, a special type of gift certificate has been issued for use by all sectors of society. After the discussion, voting was held, and the elected directors were Fang Yongkang, Lu Xingjie, Jiang Zhongfu, Dong Xixiang, and Tong Bingsheng, a total of five people, and the supervisors were Chen Xuyuan and Jin Shaowen, a total of two people.

The four walls were covered with elegiac couplets. At half past three, Mrs. Guo Bingwen, the president, announced the meaning of the memorial service. Then, children from the Education Institute, including Li Guiying and Bao Baoyu, sang a memorial song. The singing was mournful, and everyone in attendance was moved to tears. Pastor You gave a speech about Mrs. Jiang and her family's ordeal. Mrs. Liu Zhanen delivered a eulogy, stating briefly that she had known Mrs. Jiang for many years. Her character was noble, and she was a capable wife and mother in assisting her husband and educating her children. She was also enthusiastic about public welfare and provided many-sided support for the society's undertakings. Now that she has sacrificed her life for the country, it is a great misfortune for mankind. As we remember her virtuous example, we should follow Mrs. Jiang's spirit, continue to work hard, and live up to the meaning of today's memorial service. After the speech, Ms. Wang Yangmeizhen, representing the board of directors and staff, presented a wreath. Then, those present donated money to give to Mrs. Jiang's nine-year-old orphaned daughter, Pi Yu, clothing materials and other things she loved, to express their grief and condolences. The meeting adjourned around five o'clock after taking a photograph.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have just read the article "The Last Stand of Traitors in Zhenru District" published in your newspaper (June 8th). It stated that the report from the 3rd Precinct of the 4th District mentioned the representative of the visiting police officer, Stone, speaking on behalf of Chief Stone, saying, "According to Police Officer Liu, when the case occurred on the 23rd, the precinct was unaware of it because it had just taken over defense. After a report was made, Chief Stone went to meet with Municipal Committee Member Hong Lanxiang, but Hong claimed to be unaware at the time. Afterwards, the plainclothes police of the district who were responsible for taking over defense reported witnessing the incident, and although they intended to stop it at the time, they were unable to. Therefore, the clues in this matter are very suspicious." I am extremely surprised after reading this. Chief Stone has met with me several times to discuss the issue of the precinct renting a house, but he never mentioned this case. It is strange where Police Officer Liu's statement that I claimed to be unaware came from. Furthermore, the section of my statement stating that Shen Zhilai resided in Zhenru, purchased land, and built a house, all through my management, is also inconsistent with the facts. Shen Zhilai purchased land in Nanyang House ten years ago, and it was introduced by Jin Jun Shaolian at the time. I only met Mr. Shen at this time. Shen's house was not built through my management. Furthermore, according to Wang Tuanzheng Shouyu, other sections are also mostly inconsistent with the facts. I should write a letter to request a correction to clarify the facts. I am deeply grateful for your fairness.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hong Lanxiang, Municipal Committee Member of Zhenru District, Shanghai</p>

<p>Aphorisms of Ma Xiangbo, the 93-Year-Old</p>
<h3>Original Object</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom</p>
<p>I have loved studying science since I was a child. I have a special interest in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. When I went to Shanghai to study, Western science was just beginning to develop at that time. I still remember making gas with vacuum bottles, which could actually burn for a minute or two, and rubbing wool cloth with glass tubes, which could attract paper scraps after rubbing. I often used these physical experiments as a pastime. People often looked at me strangely, but they didn't know that carbon gas can ignite and that glass tubes can generate electromagnetic force after rubbing. I even joked with them that I could make amber out of glass!</p>
<p>Speaking of amber, one must think of the old saying "amber picks up mustard seeds" and "magnet attracts needles." These things were actually discovered in the Han Dynasty, but everyone couldn't explain the reason and didn't want to investigate it; when there was no way, they attributed it to the influence of yin and yang, which was mysterious and incredible.</p>
<p>Originally, science must have abstraction, and without abstraction, it cannot encompass everything. The Chinese people's power of abstraction is very weak, which is a major reason for the lack of development of science. The ancients said it well, "Things have roots and branches, and affairs have priorities." There must be a cause for every effect, but China has always emphasized the application of this principle on behavior, not on learning. We only talk about "original conduct" and less about "original principles," only talk about "original way" and less about "original object."</p>
<h3>Sketches from the Battlefield (1)</h3>
<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>From the North Station to Baoshan Road</p>
<p>The tense atmosphere of wartime has disappeared. What replaces him is naturally the enjoyment of singing and dancing in the peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<p>The North Station, which bears the brunt of the impact. If you are happy. It's still good to take a trip from the perspective of watching a movie because when the foreign soldiers stand guard with their fierce and sword-shining rifles. We are filled with regret for missing the opportunity to personally visit our Chinese territory. When you can freely walk into that kind and broken North Station with your arms open. What kind of emotion will you have again? And the girls in narrow, long cheongsams twisting their waists. When those clear and courageous high heels stepped onto the platform that had just been wiped of bloodstains. What impression does this reflect?</p>
<p>Broken North Station, ah. You make people feel so much.</p>
<p>Except that the ticket office still maintains its old state. All the cargo yards, platforms. And the three-story building. The shattered corpses, rubble, and powder ash. Collapsed in the four places. On the third floor of the main entrance. There is still a shell-like wall left. There are still workers dismantling bricks and tiles on it. This is probably the same as "recovering lost territory." Slowly try to restore the old state.</p>
<p>Out of the North Station. Walking along the Hu-Ning Station Road towards Baoshan Road. On this road. One can already imagine the scene of hand-to-hand combat and blood baths during the war. There are still rectangular gun holes temporarily opened by soldiers on the walls of the residences along the road. Every brick and tile still bears the marks of bullets and fire. On the iron pillars blocking the road. You can clearly find the power of each bullet entering human skin. That is the same as a gun target. Carved with a honeycomb image.</p>
<p>Walk into Baoshan Road. Pass Qiujiang Road. Baochang Road to Baoxing Road. All the way to the five-story building of the Oriental Library and the Commercial Press opposite.</p>
<p>Because of visiting the "battlefield." And once jumped in the artillery fire. A broken building that collapsed in the blood. On Baoshan Road. We didn't see a more complete building. Can shoot in the eye</p>
<h3>Sending to Tao Peisan in Nanjing</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>How is your tour in Shanxi and Henan, the traces of the journey are clear, like snow prints. Once spring comes with new grass, after countless disasters, the old mountains and rivers remain. Swearing an oath with wine on a tray is still there, the railway tracks are laid horizontally amidst many war bones. Could it be that we're competing to be energetic in old age, finally shaking the Jiangnan wind and moon?</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Jing Mengdie of Dantu</h3>
<p>— Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>We first met at the Chrysanthemum Society, on a day of light rain and yellow flowers (Zhang Baixi and Xia Yihe of the same town once invited us to a chrysanthemum banquet, which allowed me to first meet Mengdie), he came crazily with a wet kerchief and wine, I was happy to receive a letter from the wild goose (Mengdie once wrote a record of the Yiyuan Gathering, which can be seen in this talk, praising my father and mentioning me), the world is in chaos and he is still a traveler, his talent is great but his life is not long, Zhuang Zhou truly transformed into a butterfly, the setting moon is sadly lonely. (Mengdie was the secretary of the Rong family of Liangxi, and recently passed away from cholera, alas!).</p>
<p>what's inside. It's nothing more than that appearance torn to pieces after being washed by the fire. Bombed by artillery shells and bombs. After the Japanese army withdrew. After we received this broken Baoshan Road. He suddenly dragged the young men and women from the dreams of Nanjing Road and Simalu to this battlefield.</p>
<p>The residents on Baoshan Road. Sure enough, they want to cry without tears. And what kind of feeling do we Chinese people have about this broken territory?</p>
<h3>Lovers Sacrificed in the Shanghai Battle</h3>
<p>— Tian Hen</p>
<p>The army is fierce, and the war is dangerous. There are clear instructions in the ancient books. This time, the Japanese army invaded our Songhu and a great war broke out. It lasted for thirty-two days and nights. Its fierceness and danger is the crown of any war in our country's history for many years. Because the enemy army has aircraft raging, no matter whether it is the front line or the rear, they are all harmed. In these thirty-two days and nights. I don't know how many couples. Because of this, they were separated or died. I can't get together again. It is the most tragic thing in the world. According to a friend, there are even couples from other cities. Also sacrificed in this battle for no reason. The man's surname is Wu and his family is quite wealthy. He had finished middle school and was in love with Ms. Li, a teacher at a girls' school in the same village. So at the age of twenty-five. Still not married. Wu's father is a businessman. His mind is very old. I think Li's family is very poor. The woman's father is also dead. Only her mother is healthy. Relying on the woman to teach with a whip for a living. I don't want her to be a daughter-in-law. I don't know for what reason. I hate women being teachers. Wu asked him many times. Request to marry Li. All were severely reprimanded. After that, I didn't dare to say anything. But whenever his father discussed marriage with him. Wu also tried his best to oppose it. Therefore, the relationship between father and son is very bad. Although the woman is in love. But more open-minded than Wu. Have thoughts. Once persuaded him not to disobey Ci Yan. I think our love. Focus on the spirit. Why be so particular about the form of husband and wife? She has no uncles. There are no brothers either. There is only one mother. This single shadow. No matter whether you can marry Wu or not. She will never be a concubine to others for the rest of her life. If marrying Wu is good. Otherwise, swear to be a spiritual couple with Wu. I hope Wu won't go against his parents' wishes. But Wu is not as open-minded as women. Always mournful. When it comes to last winter. Wu's father suddenly became an unyielding friend with a wealthy businessman in the city. The businessman has a daughter. Also very intelligent. So marry her. This time Wu's father must want him to succeed. Regardless of Wu's wishes. Straighten the red rope. Wu Wen was furious. Complain to the woman. The woman also persuaded him. Wu said angrily. Then I should leave this place. To the ends of the earth. You can let the duckweed float around. He had already spoken. The woman then asked. Where are you going? Said. I'm going to Shanghai first. While speaking and walking. Don't look back. But I heard the woman say. You ran away for me. I have to endure being left alone. You should go with me. Wu finally ignored it. The next morning, he quietly came to Shanghai. Who knew that the great war would break out in a few days? I suddenly thought of the woman's words "I can't bear to stay alone." Did she really follow him? If she came, she would definitely go to Zhabei. Because the woman knew that he had a close friend in Zhabei. Then I can't help but worry. At that time, Wu happened to be living in a small family of his friend in the concession. So it was not difficult. Then I got news from my hometown. The woman really arrived in Shanghai. So I tried to risk going to Zhabei to visit. Then I heard that the woman had died tragically. Wu was almost desperate in grief. And returned to his friend's residence. Also died in a few days.</p>
<h3>On Saving the Country Through Honesty and Frugality (6)</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Nie Zengjifen, Written by his Son Qijie</p>
<p>The above examples of wise monarchs, good generals, and prime ministers are all evidence of their ability to regulate their behavior with frugality and virtue, thereby benefiting and strengthening their countries. This is the fundamental purpose of Chinese etiquette and teachings. So, is morality truly passive? Let's further confirm this with recent Western events. For example, Washington and Lincoln are both known throughout the world for their honest, frugal, and private virtues. Their great achievements are evident to all and need no further elaboration. Cavour, who rebuilt Italy, dedicated himself to the country and vowed not to marry in order to achieve great things. The current German Chancellor, Brüning, remains unmarried. Apart from food, all of his monthly salary is returned to the national treasury and he does not accumulate private wealth. Therefore, even though the German people are in extremely difficult circumstances, they are still able to cooperate with the government. The people call Brüning the savior of Germany. Stalin of Russia was able to make his people endure hardship and work hard to complete his five-year plan, and people were happy to follow him. This is because he was able to live a frugal and simple life, no different from the masses, and his honesty was trusted by the people. Mahatma Gandhi of India is the foremost hero of today. The reason why he is trusted and followed by the people of his country is also due to his self-discipline and perseverance. Gandhi's daily diet consists of only one vegetable and a small amount of goat's milk. His clothes are made of yarn spun by himself. He does not use any foreign goods, and he does not even take boats or trains. Even if it is thousands of miles away, he goes on foot. Today, people think that using scientific inventions can increase the efficiency of doing things. But are there any Europeans or Americans who can achieve the same efficiency as Gandhi? There are those in the world who can subdue the enemy's soldiers without fighting. Gandhi is one of them. The late Marquis Wen Zheng had a saying, "The clearer the spirit, this meaning can only be known by those who work hard." From what has been said above, successful and effective people, sages and philosophers, Chinese and Western, would not deeply humble themselves with regard to their own indulgence, and would minimize the enjoyment of the body. In short, it is self-control and restraint of desires.</p>
<h3>A Record of White Lotus Root Flour</h3>
<p>— The Mistress of Embroidery Ball Nunnery</p>
<p>Previously, I accidentally read the article "Purple Orchid Flower Pieces," which contained Ya Jiezhi's "Qing Ping Yue" lyrics, praising the beauty of Dongda Pond in Wuxi. In the lyrics, it is said, "The stream and mountains are secluded and beautiful, and new makeup appears on the embankment. A small parting makes the peach blossoms even more colorful, and the faces are different from the old times. The distant peaks have blurred eyebrow colors, and the green willows have newly combed hair. Cleverly facing a pool of bright mirror, what can you do to compare it to Xizi". It happened to be a time of bright spring and pleasant scenery, which further aroused my desire to travel. Therefore, I stole a day of leisure with Cheng Jun Zhu Ping and went to fulfill the appointment of Wang Pengxiang Jun.</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived in Wuxi, we went straight to Dongda Pond. We saw that the peach blossoms were in full bloom, with patches of red clouds, set off by green willows, which added to the charm. The pond water was clear and bright like a mirror. Along the pond, there was a small path, with countless peach trees planted on both sides. Among them, those with white and rose-purple colors were especially interesting.</p>
<p>When the small path was exhausted, there was a long bridge. Climbing the pavilion and looking around, the mountains, rivers, peach trees, and willows were all in sight, which made people feel like they were in a paradise.</p>
<p>Leaving Dachi, we went straight to Meiyuan. The plum blossoms had withered, but the residual fragrance was still there. There was a pavilion in the garden called Can Ying. We rested there for a while. It was already past noon, and our stomachs were rumbling slightly. Pengxiang then took out the lotus root flour he had brought. First, mix it well with cold boiled water. Then, use boiling water to mix and stir it while flushing it. The clear fragrance overflowed, and it was rich and greasy. I was surprised that it was not like ordinary products. When asked, Pengxiang said that my ancestor, Xiaotang, regarded lotus root flour as the best product for nourishing health, and he was saddened that there were many adulterated products sold on the market. Therefore, he spared no effort to supervise his family to purchase real white lotus root and study its production. Therefore, the powder made is exceptionally pure and clean. My father used to go to the Nanyang Persuasion Fair with Lotus and won a gold medal. It is famous far and wide. When I heard this, I asked to see the trademark. Zhu Ping smiled and said, if you want to buy it, please recognize Liyang Wang Jingyu Tang, so that you will not make a mistake. We smiled at each other and went back. (Thank you)</p>
<p>Short News: Mr. He Haiming, the owner of Qiu Happiness Studio, has recently seen the urgent national crisis, and specially advocated war literature. Taking this Shanghai war as the background, he interspersed a love story and wrote a war novel called "Bloodstains on the Huangpu." It is planned to have twenty-four episodes. Each episode is 5,000 words, totaling about 120,000 words. It has now been completed. However, I have not yet decided which bookstore to print. Recently, many letters have been sent to He Yu, No. 14 Yian Lane, Tianjin French Concession, to contact me. If this book is published, it will be able to shine in war literature.</p>
<h3>Record of a Couple's Life in the Military (73)</h3>
<p>— Master Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Accompanying the Special Train to Drive Away Guests with Empty Surprise, Sitting in the Cold Yamen Turning into a Stone of Reverie</p>
<p>When we arrived at Qianmen Station. Only the station was unusually calm. There were only some military police and bands lined up to see off the guests. They had arrived at the platform early. Standing there like wooden chickens under the dim and unclear electric light poles. Then he found a special train and got on the car. Seeing it was dark and silent inside. How gloomy. Deputy Guo explained. The train head has not been hung up yet. The lights are not connected. Not everyone has arrived yet. Only then is there a vacant position. But in the darkness, I saw a long row of cabin doors all tightly closed. I don't know which room to open is good. Deputy Guo was running back and forth in the aisle. While shouting what Chief Zhu. Probably this Chief Zhu is the special administrator of this car. He has to find him to find a way. After shouting for a while. I vaguely heard a very weak voice answering in a cabin. Deputy Guo groped in the direction. Leading An Yutian to push the door open. I saw a small wooden table by the window inside. Half a stub of candle was lit. The wax flowers bloomed very large. The halo was flickering and not bright. I could only vaguely see that inside were two rows of berths on the left and right. Divided into two layers, both up and down. They have all been hoisted up. It was an old-fashioned first-class sleeping car. Chief Zhu was lying on the high bunk on the left. Leaning on the edge of the bed from the misty, half-awake, sleepy eyes. After asking Deputy Guo's intention. He casually pointed down and said. It's this berth underneath. When Deputy Guo saw that the transfer had been completed. There was nothing more to do. He turned around and left without saying a word. An Yutian sat down. Looking up. He was just about to chat with Chief Zhu. But I heard a very heavy snoring sound coming from above. It turned out that Chief Zhu had turned over. He fell asleep again, snoring. Leaving An Yutian sitting coldly under the candlelight like beans. The scene was so bleak. Later, I don't know how long I sat in boredom. Suddenly the car shook. The electric lights immediately shone brightly. An Yutian thought to himself. The train head must have been connected. Governor Ye will be on the train in a while. I won't feel lonely anymore. Just as I was feeling happy. I heard the sound of car horns. People's footsteps. Shouts. The symphony was noisy. Breaking the original silent air. Soon. All these sounds became more chaotic. A sharp whistle. Sent from afar, one after another. Then I heard someone running wildly on the platform and shouting loudly. The commander is here.</p>

<h3>The False Country Selects Girls to Go to Japan to Present Credentials</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The other day, a telegram from Beiping reported that the false state government had selected five girls from Japan, Manchuria, and Korea to go to Japan in mid-June to present credentials.</p>
<p>Presenting credentials is also a very important matter in international affairs. Both the presenter and the receiver have a relationship of dignity. Now the false state has actually selected five girls to go to Japan to present credentials. Isn't this a strange and special thing? I therefore studied it, and there are indeed many meanings in it.</p>
<p>1. Isn't the false Manchuria called a young master's country? But although the young master's authority is small, it still has some masculinity. As for women, they have no masculinity at all. The husband's authority is the only one that rises. Using women to represent the false Manchuria fully expresses Japan's "wise mother and good wife doctrine."</p>
<p>2. It is already strange to use women to present credentials. Among women, girls from Japan, Manchuria, and Korea are selected. The meaning is as if saying, the women of Manchuria are equal to the women of Korea, and the women of Korea are equal to the women of Japan. It is the meaning of the Holy Mother, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit, three in one, as the Christians say.</p>
<p>3. It is called the Manchurian State, so there should be many civil and military officials who can represent the country and accept the mission. There must be not a few. Now, not a single person is sent, and only a few modern girls are sent to flatter the envoy. It is truly "the Manchurian court has many rice buckets, only to win a smile from a beauty."</p>
<p>Judging from the above points, Japan's manipulation of the false Manchuria can be said to have reached its extreme. And I heard that Japan has some regrets about the organization of the false Manchuria. Therefore, the newspaper reported yesterday that the unification plan for the four heads of Manchuria will be passed soon. If so, the puppet show of the false Manchurian state will soon "stop the gongs."</p>

<h3>Qing Ping Yue</h3>
<p>— Lustrous Rain Su Liangru</p>
<p>Dense overcast, day after day of wind and rain. Annoying the passers-by, their intestines are broken. All the way, falling flowers and flying catkins. Sparse, dense, and continuous. The path is overgrown with grass, and orioles are flying. Leaving a straw raincoat and hat. Laughing at him as if drunk and crazy.</p>
<h3>A Return Visit to Zhenru</h3>
<p>— Gan Fang</p>
<p>I recall last year's end, driving away for a brief farewell. The frosty wind blew my clothes, its touch almost cracking my skin. Looking back, the radio tower stood tall, towering to the sky. To the southeast was a university, solemn and outstanding. The sound of music and singing flowed continuously, season after season. Time is short and swift; a separation, and suddenly three months have passed. I drive seeking old haunts, but the old haunts are like a dream. The once bustling place is now a den for squirrels and rats. The setting sun brings broken trails of smoke, wild birds peck at white bones. Spring plowing has long been abandoned; the wild fields are all overgrown. Human affairs change so suddenly; how can one not have gray hair?</p>

<h3>Methods for Obtaining Fruit Juice</h3>
<p>— Huai</p>
<p>The uses of fruit juice, aside from making various wines, extend to summer beverages such as orange juice, lemonade, ice cream, pudding, etc.: all of which require fruit juice as an ingredient. The components in fruit juice related to human nutrition, besides fructose, fruit acids, and salts, also include an important substance: the vitamins commonly seen in recent scientific advertisements. Vitamins are especially abundant in brightly colored fresh fruits, thus fruit juice is also an inexpensive source of vitamins. If one goes a step further and engages in homemade production, it can, on a larger scale, reclaim lost profits from abroad, and on a smaller scale, supplement the family economy. Here, I will introduce the methods for extracting fruit juice.</p>
<p>Good quality fruit juice has a bright and beautiful color, clear liquid, and an aroma no different from the fresh fruit. To obtain a high-quality product, special attention must be paid to the following points during extraction: (1) Strict avoidance of contact with iron or tin utensils during squeezing and boiling. (2) Must be boiled in copper utensils, but never allow it to cool in the copper utensil to prevent fruit acids from chemically reacting with the copper in the air, which can spoil the color and flavor of the fruit juice. (3) When boiling, maintain a temperature between 80 and 100 degrees Celsius, and remove from heat immediately.</p>
<p>For the production method, first select juicy fresh fruits, place them in a linen bag, and put them under a press. To prevent the bag from tearing, gradually apply pressure to squeeze the juice. Once most of the fruit juice has flowed out, apply greater pressure to squeeze it dry. The fruit juice obtained in this way contains a gelatinous fruit pulp called Pektin. If not removed, it will solidify into a gel-like substance after cooling, making it unsuitable for use. Add 5% or 8% pure alcohol to this fruit juice, and the Pektin will precipitate to the bottom. Then, simply take the clear liquid from the top, or use filtration to remove the precipitate. Unfortunately, the fruit juice obtained by this method contains a small amount of alcohol, and its color and aroma may be spoiled, so it can only be used to make fruit wine. Another method utilizes the natural yeast attached to the fruit peel to precipitate the Pektin, making it easy to remove. To do this, take the squeezed fruit juice, add 1% or 2% refined white sugar, and pour it into a large glass bottle or jar, filling only two-thirds of the total volume. Then, tightly close the bottle opening with a wooden stopper, and insert a glass tube into the stopper. The lower end of the tube should not be immersed in the fruit juice, and the upper end should be bent downwards, immersing it in a cup of water. Leave it to stand in a room where the indoor temperature should not exceed 20 or 25 degrees Celsius. After one or two days, carbon dioxide bubbles will form in the fruit juice and escape through the glass tube into the cup of water. Fermentation will end after several days, and the carbon dioxide bubbles will also stop. Quickly pour out the clear liquid from the top, filter the bottom layer, and fresh fruit juice is ready. If you want to preserve it for a long time, heat it in a copper pot to 80 or 100 degrees Celsius, and seal it in bottles while still hot. This can preserve the color and flavor for more than a year. If it is intended solely for beverage use, add the same weight of refined white sugar to it before heating, boil until it froths, immediately remove the foam, and seal it in bottles for later use.</p>

<h3>Making a Living This Way</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiben</p>
<p>"Ah, alas, alas, the executed robber, the floating corpse, you really are going to kill me! What kind of heart do you have, taking away the money I worked so hard to make, what am I going to live on tomorrow? Alas, alas!" At the western end of Pushi Road, along the roadside, a stinky tofu stand was parked. Standing next to it was a person with disheveled clothes and a coarse face, eyes brimming with tears, uttering such sorrowful cries mixed with curses.</p>
<p>Within less than ten minutes of this sound spreading, it attracted passersby on the road, and twenty or thirty people gathered around. At this moment, a worker-like man in the crowd asked the crying person, "How was your money stolen, and how much was there?"</p>
<p>"To be honest with you, gentlemen, just now a young man came to buy my tofu, and said that my bowl wasn't clean, and asked me to go across the street to the tap water to wash it. I was fooled for a moment, and entrusted him with my carrying pole. When I came back after washing it, the man was gone. Later, I looked at the money jar next to the pot, and it was gone. I make a little over two dollars a day, it was all in there. Now it's been stolen, how are my family of five going to live?" This tofu seller told the audience the whole story from beginning to end. After speaking, he began to wail loudly.</p>
<p>The friend who had asked earlier took out two dimes from his pocket and gave them to him, and advised him to be careful next time. As the peddler accepted his coins and advice, he turned around and said to the audience:</p>
<p>"The people of Shanghai are really bad. They even want to take advantage of a poor peddler like this. I am also a worker, and seeing him in such a pitiful state, how can I not help him? Please, everyone, help him out too, and collect two dollars for him, so he can still do business tomorrow. This kind of good deed is more beneficial than burning incense!"</p>
<p>The onlookers, hearing his words, felt that there was some truth to them, and he himself had already taken the initiative, opening his wallet first. Looking again at the peddler, whose face was now in an extremely pitiful and tragic state, still crying severely, they all expressed their sympathy in unison. You gave a dime, he gave two dimes, and in less than ten minutes, the full amount was collected. The peddler accepted the audience's relief money, thanked them repeatedly, wiped away his tears, and went off with his carrying pole.</p>
<p>As the audience dispersed, someone in a cigarette and paper shop by the roadside said, "Ah, today's double act wasn't bad, it was twice as good as yesterday."</p>
<p>The Problem of Poverty</p>
<h3>A Quick Record of Impoverished Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhang</p>
<p>"Father, we have no rice left for tomorrow. No firewood, salt, or soy sauce either. We only have thirty copper coins left for household expenses. Ada is going to start crying about buying... These days are really hard to bear. You have to think of a solution, right?" A middle-aged woman, about thirty years old, said to the man next to her on the pillow.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's really distressing to talk about it. What solution can I think of? Not only is the school salary discounted by 40%, but they also owe me a month and a half. I asked the principal to get it, and he claimed he hadn't received it yet. Asked him to borrow it? He said he didn't have it either. My colleagues are generally just as poor as I am. On the relatives' side, only old Huang is relatively rich, but he's also very snobbish. My dear, if things continue like this, we'll just starve to death. Ah!" A middle-aged man, his face full of worry, also replied to his wife.</p>
<p>"Although Atu next door is a laborer, his life is quite comfortable. They always have some meat dish to eat at home, and they also have some savings every month. You're just a schoolteacher, and people always call me 'Teacher's Wife,' but in reality, I'm not as good as Atu's wife. Thinking about it, I get so angry I could die..." A schoolteacher's wife said to her husband again.</p>
<p>"Don't worry and fret about everything. We are, after all, of the teacher class. Like Atu, even though he can make money, people always say that they're of the lower class, laborers. Our image is still better than theirs. Although we are suffering a bit now, the salary will eventually come. Can you be patient for now? If we have nothing to use tomorrow, go pick out one or two pieces of clothing to pawn, and we'll talk about it after I get the salary. Our whole family will have a joyful meal,..." A primary school teacher replied to his wife again.</p>
<p>"Ah! Forget it, that's always what you say. Didn't you say the same thing to me last time? It's already been a month, and we've only gotten five silver dollars back. What clothes can I pawn? We'll pawn everything away eventually. Marrying a husband like you, I'll either die of anger or starve to death. Alas, that's my fate, what can I say?" His wife said angrily to her husband.</p>
<p>"Ah!" The man just sighed, not saying a word.</p>
<p>The passage above was told to me by a friend of mine, because his neighbor is a primary school teacher and his wife and child. According to him, they are often like this, especially since the Shanghai Incident occurred. Now, they are two months behind on rent, and they really look very pitiful.</p>
<p>After listening to him, I immediately jotted it down in shorthand. As I was writing the manuscript, I couldn't help but sigh in my mouth.</p>
<p>"Class harms people, teachers harm people," these two complaints.</p>
<p>Business Sketch</p>
<h3>Inside a Bank</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>I have always been most afraid of entering pawnshops and banks because they often make me feel extremely humiliated. But yesterday, in order to cash a check, I finally had to step over that high threshold again.</p>
<p>As I fearfully found the cashing counter, there was already a young man standing there, more awkward than me, tightly clutching a check in his hand and staring at the person inside the "copper railing" with kind, pleading eyes. So I also took out my check and stood next to that person, cautiously daring not to make a sound. But I saw that the bank teller in front of me was still flipping through the books and writing foreign words on them. He was careful with his work and completely unaware that we were waiting for his disposal. So my mood became anxious, but I dared not be anxious. After a while, the young man finally said with a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"Sir! Excuse me."</p>
<p>"......" But that sir didn't even glance at him, not answering.</p>
<p>"Sir! I've really been waiting too long." He said again, seeming a little impatient. So that sir said even more harshly:</p>
<p>"What's the rush?"</p>
<p>"Ah! What's the rush!" How authoritative! I thought. Fear and anger simultaneously surged to my heart. Of course, that person dared not say anything more.</p>
<p>After that, a sound of leather shoes stopped behind us, followed by a tall foreigner squeezing in. So I quickly made way, only to hear the foreign gentleman say:</p>
<p>"Hello, Please." Immediately that sir responded,</p>
<p>"Yes!" and came over immediately.</p>
<p>In about five minutes, that foreign gentleman walked out with a large stack of banknotes, chest puffed out.</p>
<p>At this time, that sir glanced at us all, as if trying to find something different about us. So, luckily, my check was snatched away.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, as I retreated, I felt infinitely apologetic towards the person who was even more awkward than me.</p>
<p>Walking out of the bank, even the stuffy, hot air felt particularly pleasant, so I took a deep breath.</p>
