<h3 id="c1">日派野村特使赴美元 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自東亞風雲緊急而後國人每懷一疑問曰。日俄戰乎。日美戰乎。從過去之情勢觀之日俄與日美之情感。時而緊張。時而緩和。大略相同。確難窺測其究竟。但至近來。則吾人可以明瞭日俄間之所謂備準開戰。感情惡化。不過故布一種疑陣。而日美間之感情惡化。愈趨急劇。則己無可爲諱。故前問題之解答。不必多言也。</p>
<p>日美在日俄戰争後。即己互相搆怨。美國斯時之目光。己放棄。大西洋而移於太平洋方面。力主「滿洲之門户開放與機會均等。」日本對之己大疑忌。迨歐戰發動。美又宣布「美國政策。爲解决中國之永遠安全與和平計劃。努力維持中國領土及行政的安全。並依照條約及國際法。保證友好國一切的權利。使在中國全領土内。樹立不偏不倚的通商原則。」日本對之。更大爲憤激。及至九一八事件發生。美復重申前議。并提出非戰公約九國公約。以阻日本之行動。至是日本全國之青年軍人。遂起極大之衝動。咸以美之舉動。不啻進扼日本之生命線。忍無可忍。惟有與之一决雌雄。於是其報紙。其雜誌。及種種小册。連篇累牘。皆討論二次大戰之準備。甚至如前月東京萬朝報所載。公然認美艦隊之集中太平洋。爲其挑戰行動。主張日本應對美先取攻勢。以奪取太平洋之海上覇權。軍事家又研究日美兩國海軍之優劣。以爲目前之艦隊力量。美劣於日。三年後必日。劣於美。故尤主張速戰。吾人僅據以上情形觀察。兩國感情之惡。己入於尖鋭化。美國數十年來對於遠東之主張。再三聲明。當然不肯輕易放棄。而日本對於滿洲之拒絶第三者干涉。不容美國之置喙。亦己迭有表示。不肯稍有所讓步。此種情勢。早己顯然共見。然則如之何而能避免此正面之衝突乎。</p>
<p>日美邦交惡化之醖釀己久。所以未破裂者。以未遇相當。之時機耳今之滿洲問題。國聯調查團不日即提出報告。是國聯解决滿洲問题。即在斯時。而日美兩方對滿洲問題之正面接觸。亦在斯時。國聯如何處置發表之日。恐即爲東亞戰禍第一彈相投之日也。惟美國斯時。軍事上之準備若何。友邦之助力若何。必爲其鄭重考慮之點。而日本今日慷慨激昻之勇氣。果可以吞美洲而逼巴拿馬否。恐臨時亦必有所顧慮。故此次野村特使之遣派。其任務雖爲求美國之諒解與消除誤會。然以我人觀之。非藉以試探美國當局對滿之眞意。即爲其最後躊蹰之一念所迫而出也。日美間最後能否避免正面衝突。當視此野村特使之一行。然而其希望恐亦微矣。世界人士。早己目遠東之遼東半島。爲東洋之巴爾幹。今東洋巴爾幹。己爲人競争而禍將爆發。而我東洋巴爾幹之主人。將袖手坐視。一如隔岸之觀火耶。嗚呼。</p>

<p>▲火烽球藝平平</p>
<p>▲客軍實力不弱</p>
<p>——結果四十比十一——</p>
<p>▲今日網球戰嶺南</p>
<p>四川二十軍籃球隊、昨晚七時與火烽隊作戰於中華籃球房、查火烽隊爲上海籃球會乙組第五部中之中等球隊、球藝平平、川軍實力頗有可觀、可及上海籃球會乙組第二部之球隊、故昨晚之戰、形勢相差懸殊、結果川軍以四十比十一大勝、</p>
<p>▲上半時開賽後、川軍極爲活動、傅遞擲籃、恰到妙處、故分數迭增、當得十三分時、火烽方開紀録、上半時結果、川軍十七分、火烽僅二分耳、</p>
<p>▲下半時、下半時起川軍球勢益盛、陷陣建功、勢如破竹、火烽雖努力反攻、卒以力弱無效、故比數始終相差極遼、下半時成二十三比九觀川軍人才頗平均、聯絡雖稍欠缺、而各人頗爲努力、擲籃亦有把握、昨賽中左鋒裴宋澤共得十七分、成績如下、</p>

<p>▲兩隊球藝均佳競争頗多精彩</p>
<p>▲青年先開紀録卒以一比四敗</p>
<p>金風送爽、艶陽普照、芳草如菌之中華棒球塲上、昨日下午五時、華東與青年作夏令足球比賽、良辰美點、極間情逸致之妙、兩隊球藝相仿、人才傑出、夏令足球賽中之姣姣者、俱有染</p>
<p>指錦標之資格、挾路相逢、自有一番劇戰、青年雄風可畏、先開紀録、結果卒以一比四敗於華東、觀者無不心滿意足、歎爲壯觀蓋兩隊表演之佳、實開夏令赛以來所未有、此外兩組果（一）星光勝强南、四比一、（二）青華勝大江、七比一、青華隊尚未敗北、前途亦有希望、兹將華東對青年之陣線及比賽情形述下</p>
<p>▲華東隊</p>
<p>錢敬鏞</p>
<p>王長頴吴幼林屠開元</p>
<p>陸鍾恩李甯胡有成上楊人偉下</p>

<p>李文清鄭連坤上朱文奎下</p>
<p>王逢春</p>
<p>張彭年上朱文瀾下馬文鈞上沈錦達下顧一飛祝小雲</p>
<p>▲青年先發制人裁判員何克輝、鳴笛開始華東開球先攻、球勢順利、迫近敵門、無功而還、青年忽如狂風暴雨、直向華東球門湧進、華東猝不及防、加以後方疏忽、措置失當、青年視小榮顧一飛同時並進、華東陳祥龍監禦不及、顧一飛衝至門下、一舉成功、觀衆精神一振、華東爲之一驚、此前十分鐘内事也、</p>
<p>▲華東立即還禮以球勢而論、華東常佔優勢、論者以爲青年雖勇、恐難保龍門之不開、果也、五分鐘内、華東即還敬青年一球、當華東四面包圍青年球門之時、錢敬鏞角球送出、屠開元接濟得法、胡有成得撥球人門、縱使守門手段高妙、亦無救藥矣、</p>
<p>▲錢敬鏞之威風半小時時、華東胡有成又中一球、此球之得、固應歸功胡之一踢、然錢敬鏞之雄風、尤不可不記、爰屠開元在中線地位、將球遠送左角邊界左翼錢敬鏞原亦在中線地位、但見球疾馳而上、竟能衝破敵方防線、而將球傅中、其跑也、疾如龍駒、加以觀衆呐喊助威、其氣勢之雄壯、不可一世、上半時華東以二比一佔優、</p>
<p>▲巧生亦中一球下半時起、華東形勢益佳、前鋒之活躍、前衛之驍勇、後衛之堅固、在在使青年减色董小培一次攻門、似己進門、但被青年守門搭住救出、一者失望、一者驚喜、惟華東軍威雄壯、青年雖努力抵禦、卒難八面顧到、久而久之、奚巧生得錢敬鏞之傅球、攻入門内、乃成三此一、</p>
<p>▲敬鏞頭上功夫兩軍角逐、形勢平稳者多時、青年前鋒、幾難越雷池一步、球勢乃偏重於一方、幸而青年守衛、尚稱努力、時能化險爲夷、當比賽終了前三分鐘時、青年門前、兩軍混戰、屠開元一次猛射、球從横木彈回、力道甚足、其聲如砲、雖未進門、己使青年飽受虚驚、但由虚而實、錢敬鏞忽頂球入門矣、爲時無幾、比賽告終、華東以四比一勝、</p>
<p>▲老將威風不减查華東隊中、多海上名將、實力不弱、昨日更見特色如錢敬鏞、屠</p>
<p>開元、董小培奚巧生、胡有成等、均有良好表演、李甯昨日初次出塲、四面顧到、大有一夫當關、萬夫莫敵之勢、汗馬戎功、不可多得、後衛王長頴陳祥龍禦敵有法、失誤頗少、守門陸鍾恩安、如泰山、不勞手足、全隊精神團結、聯絡亦佳、夏令錦標、似有莫大希望、至於青年隊、多新進名</p>

<p>— 錢台生</p>
<p>淪陷在水深熱火中的東三省，説句傷心的話，快要做「週年」了。東北幾十萬的健兒，盼望着關内速遣大軍，收復失地，這批鐵與血混合的健兒，多麽殷切着祖國的復興呢？他們在這青紗帳起的時候，乘勢向各處敵軍進襲，弄得敵軍人馬紛亂，四分五裂。他們把東三省一口氣吞下去，却想不到那山林深處，有這麽一批掛彩不喊疼，顫撲不怕死的健兒，時時予敵軍重創，處處出奇兵制勝；矮子一聽見老北風，老帮頭的聲音，早嚇得膽落魂飛，他們以爲是攫奪了東三省的寳藏，却想不到是一顆埋伏深處猛烈的炸彈！</p>
<p>七月份裏，這批在血水飛沙中打滾的東北健兒，據敵人自己傅出，一共在各處進襲了一千0三十六次，我們可以想見每次中，在那漆黑的夜晚裏，匍匐在青紗帳中的健兒，看見敵人，便顧不得死活，向敵人衝擊，頭落臂斷果然顧不得，全軍覆没，也祇是這樣博得敵軍一聲得意的獰笑：槍彈與血肉的火迸，迸出了幾千年來固有民族的靈魂！</p>
<p>新民族英雄馬占山將軍果然沉悶的等待了一年，各地深山叢林中的健兒，也都納悶地遥領着關内的大軍，你眞以這些民族的靈魂，這批神出鬼没矯捷如兎的東北健兒，那敵軍犀利的軍器，那飛矢凌空的鐵鳥，和那二百五十磅重量的炸彈，眞的不能征服這批彈盡槍少的健兒麽？</p>
<p>快近「週年」的東北，這責任又應該放在誰身上呢？</p>

<p>▲戚子卿篤小二弗説好話盲詞小説雙金錠。中有揚州王三小姐來蘇告狀。至城中因果巷投奔著名訟師吴縣生員戚子卿。畫僮小二官胡言亂語一段明代故事。考長洲諸人矱野獲編。德清俞曲園茶香室叢鈔。皆載戚子卿確有其人。家住因果巷頗富有。築讀書樓。題額曰鴛鴦。繞屋遍種梅花。在四通橋右云云。清乾隆長洲進士顧俠君（嗣立）秀野草堂。一名五百梅花草堂。在閭邱坊。閭邱坊與因果巷後巷前巷。明末清初。顧氏秀野梅花。或即戚氏鴛鴦梅花。雙金錠小説。謂王三小姐認戚子卿作母舅。大成坊口寫狀伸寃。戚子卿窮無聊赖。酸氣撲鼻。與褚俞所記。全乎不合。惟戚子卿篇小二官弗説好詞之諺。悉從雙金錠説都中來。小二官爲子卿之齎值。無錫産。蘇州人謂家曰篤。係俗字。</p>
<p>▲走盡三關六碼頭孟子。古之爲關也。將以禦暴。今之爲關也。將以爲暴。春秋戰國時己然。何况後世。蘇州乃闔閭舊都。吴宫花草。譽美東南。緑水青山。艶稱今古。城周圍三十六里。旱門八。水門八。上應八風。下應八卦。伍子胥督造。設備周至。他處城池皆不及焉。原有三關六碼頭。百貨雲屯。萬商霧集。所以有金閶銀胥。銅齊鐵葑之稱。三關則一爲滸墅關。一爲鐵嶺關。一爲鷄鳴關。今關址猶存。六碼頭。則一爲萬人碼頭。誤犯人碼頭。前清外府六十三州縣遞解民刑重囚進省。赴臬憲衙門聽審。必須由水路船隻來。在萬人碼頭登岸。由是訛傅作犯人。一爲接官廳碼頭在胥門萬年橋。凡官員上任由他處來。必在此登岸。故曰接官碼頭。其餘四碼頭。詢諸白髮老翁。亦瞠目無以對。</p>

<p>— 自在</p>
<p>本年虎疫。流行之廣。傅染之速。爲近來所未有。據衛生署所公佈之染疫區域。己達十五省。計江蘇·浙江·安徽·江西·湖南·湖北·河北·山東·河南·陜西·綏遠·福建·廣東·察哈爾·四川等省。蔓延不可謂不廣。昨藴冰來自西蜀。行滕甫卸。即譚四川内江癘疫近况。其猖獗悽慘。誠令人有譚虎（虎列拉）色變之概。爲録於左。以資譚助。</p>
<p>内江因氣候反常。虎疫流行。二十日中。死去者三千餘人。即由隆昌移防内江之王學淵團部。於七月底開至。三日之内。死去九十餘人。乃移於别村以避之。目下縣城因死人過多。棺木製造不及。多用床板改製。所死之人。貧苦爲多。有用棉胎或草蓆捲屍軟葬者。亦有用大木箱載孩屍者。全家人口。一概死絶者甚多。有劉某在茶館問友人云。今晨中街出若干具。友答其出六十四具。劉正談笑間。突然倒地。不省人事。其友初尚以爲戲。及覩其色變。始覓醫藥治。醫未至而劉己死矣。又道士趙隆文。往龍院開靈。甲家死三人。乙家死二人。丙家死一人。道士在乙家作法時。竟伏地不起。主人尚以爲作法。良久。呼之不應。氣息身冷矣。又有中醫楊之厚。爲某家診受疫者六人。診未竣。開方亦未完。醫云。我回家後必死。不再診矣。診金母須交也。主人愕然。醫歸。是夕竟死去。而所診之六人。亦不能救。今全縣己入於恐怖世界。防疫驅瘟保生救命等團體甚多。其防範方法。亦殊愚拙。有放藟蒲頭於水缸者。有吃稀鹽者。有吃大蒜者。有臨時以白礬冲沸水飲者。種種不一。更有纔花舞龍。一如度歲。以期祓除不祥者。以非科學化之舉。而欲騙除有傅染性之疫。其愚亦至可憐也。</p>

<p>東北淪陷。且一載矣。袞袞諸公。方擁兵作偏安之夢。僅恃一緑林好漢月俎餘生所組織之義勇軍。轉戰於白水黑山間。以血肉之軀。與獸兵之飛機重砲。</p>
<p>以争最後勝利。沐血鏖戰。前仆後繼。此種可歌可泣之事跡。凡有血氣之徒。莫不同聲慨嘆。解囊相助。以稍盡袍澤敵愾同仇之微忱。顧吾蘇地之銀行界。對於蘇人捐助東北義勇軍兵費。竟無一銀行。代爲收滙。儼如秦越。漠然不相關。吾蘇銀行界自九一八事起後。從未解囊捐助百元以上之捐欵。惟當十九路軍退守第二防綫。日本飛機頻來視察之際。亟亟請當局拆毁火鐘樓。免爲日機注目。「國家喪亡吾不負責。不圖吾蘇銀行家。竟亦同具偉人之懷抱。可佩也。</p>
<p>吴淞閘北。血跡猶新。吾海上士女。早恢復紙醉金迷之昇平景象。摩登人物。競作游泳之戲。於是藝術畫刋中。健美之蜜斯小影。乃滿幅琳瑯。展圖對視。盡足以消壯士之魄。第東北風雲正急。朱地未復。南嶺又陷。熱河局勢。岌岌可危。一般浴水之摩登人物。偶一念及東北浴血之義勇軍。未審尚能向人前賣弄肉感否也。</p>
<p>疫癘蔓延。鄉間尤盛。吾蘇光福鄉間西華村中。一村十餘家。喪亡人數。竟超二十人以上。此雖因鄉間廁所櫛比。羣蠅成陣。而迷信之烈。尤爲致死之要素。鄉俗一遇人病。以延女巫。送疫神爲唯一治病妙法。而送疫神之祭品。主要者爲半熟之猪頭。神既送過。即取而大啖。以半熟之肉。經蠅陣包圍。狂吞飽啖。壯者平時亦難免患病。矧在疫癘之時乎。鄉人愚陋。固屬可笑可憐。第一班以改造農村自命之人物。對於此種重大問題。曾無一人向鄉民作切要之實事演講。第斤斤於三月讀畢之千字課。教訓農民。以爲改良農村之唯一要具。殊令人爲之感慨無窮也。</p>

<p>本埠大同樂會鄭覲文先生。近因年事日高。對於青年音樂專家。莫不愛如生命。有王寂紅者。南通人。原名安祥。擅琵琶古琴。爲鄭君所親授。更有劉天華者。江陰人。操藝尤精。與鄭君爲世交。故鄭君對於二子之期望亦至殷。今二子忽連翩逝世。鄭君之哀悼可知。乃作長篇駢文。於舊歷七月二十二日夜深人静。獨祭二子於大同樂會音樂室。篇中因寂紅有三角戀愛事。　備周至。亦正所以深痛之也。於天華則幾放聲大哭矣。文云。唯中華民國二十一年舊歷七月二十二日夜深人静。老拙鄭覲文謹以花香酒菓。全鳴之琴。廣陵之曲。致祭於吾門王集鴻劉天華二子之靈日。嗚呼。學士中殂。才人早世。人間不幸。千古共傷。集鴻天華皆其一也。集鴻幼讀詩書。長嫻藝術。不因環境而變其初衷。不以經濟而移其素守。亦青年之佼佼者矣。民國八年。張季直創辦伶工學校於南通。聘戲劇學者歐陽予倩長校務。集鴻因肄業焉。嗣該校停辦。集鴻隨予倩來滬。予倩因有重組新舞臺之舉。無暇教人。乃携集鴻來大同樂會。謂予曰。孺子可教也。囑予代庖。予诺之。於是集鴻日必一至。詢其所學。爲專習琵琶者。令彈之。乃海門之遺派也。予嫌其立品較次。囑爲根本改造。口講指畫。悉能心領神會。四絃之外。復習七絃。立志益堅。操藝日進。調成午夏。閙競渡之龍舟。彈到九秋。舞臨風之梧葉。陽春有脚。揮來鳥語花香。白雪消寒。漫弄瓊樓玉宇。亦國樂之良材。藝林之健者矣。一日忽來會告余曰。近作滿城風雨曲。願就正焉。因爲余一揮。且索批評。余曰。指法旋律·均無瑕疵。唯一味敷衍題而。風風雨雨。雨雨風風。絶無秋心肅殺。秋色悲觀意味。爲美中不足耳。然如頃間所彈。亦己非易事矣。集鴻日。願承教。閲數日。又來謂予曰。安祥之名太俗。擬改用泣紅二字。予大不謂然。因詔之曰。題名不嫌惡劣。惟晦氣字不可用。彼又曰。然則用寂紅可乎。余曰。不如集鴻二字之爲愈。彼貌似然之。予即疑其有異。無何。果見各報紛載兩女合嫁一男事。一時傅爲美談。羡之者有之。艶之者有之。并忌之者亦有之。在予也。則爲之一喜一懼。喜則喜二重艶福。豈非前世修來。懼則懼一點微陽。將爲括囊以竭。</p>

<h3 id="c106">總理拒毒遺訓全文 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>孫總理於民國十三年間，在廣州任大元帥時所發表之拒毒遺訓，足爲主張禁烟者之標凖。值此議論紛紜之時，總理之遺訓，誠足爲禁烟當局設施之南針，兹特照刋如次：</p>
<p>予之意見，認中國之禁烟問題與良好政府之問題，有連帶之關係，鴉片營業，絶對不能與人所賦予權方之國民政府兩立：但在政府當局，對於庶政之設施，未能實現民治之威權以前，於達到有效之禁絶，殊非可能。現在一般不法之軍閥，各在轄境之内，不但奬勵，而且强迫種植鴉片，明訂完密之禁烟計劃，爲用殊微，良以種植鴉片，較種植米穀蔬菜菓實等物，事簡而利厚，故農民大都不願，亦不敢反對軍閥强迫種烟之命令也。國際聯盟之禁烟大會，正將開會，出席該會之各國代表，應本公道之精神，毅然訂立嚴密計劃，禁止各國鴉片及其複製品，（如嗎啡海洛因等毒物）之出産，蓋中國政府破裂之結果，不但使烟苗復盛，亦使對外貿易日趨停滯，中外商人及合法商品之製造家，均受巨大損失，目下由私運私賣鴉片銷耗之鉅量欵項，若用於正當貿易，不但可使本國商業復興，並可使中外間之合法通商大形起色。邇來有以謂今日我國鴉片復興，遍地皆毒，不如法律正式允許烟土之營業，海關放任外洋鴉片入口，以充裕餉源，此等主張，絶對不當，中國之民意，尤其守法安分純潔之民衆，其意見未有不反對鴉片：苟有主張法律准許鴉片營業，或對鴉片之惡勢力表示降服者，即使爲一時權宜之計，均爲民意之公敵，今日國内情形，至爲恶劣，拒毒運動之進行，備受難阻，以致成績甚尠：然對鴉片之宣戰，	絶對不可妥恊，更不可放棄，苟負責之政府機關，爲自身之私便，及眼前之利益，倘對鴉片下旗息戰，不問久暫，均屬賣國之行爲；總之，對於鴉片之禍害，不論何種形式之降伏，均可謂爲蔑視國民之良心主張，即以持非法之鴉片爲利源之土匪式軍閥言之，亦不敢公然承素缺乏道路與各項利便交通之建設，加以不時有軍閥之鬥争，結果使農民之經濟負担日益加重，農民雖欲安分耕種普農産，殊不可能。例如廣東省政府極端反對烟毒，但鄰省私運之外，向有國外鴉片由海道輸入，在此等現狀之下，雖有良好政府如廣東省者，甘冒萬難以取締非法之鴉片營業，釐定完密計劃，以圖毒害之根本廓清，但以水陸私運之繁多，無從收相當實效，於此，吾人可見局部之舉動，殊難收效，欲達禁烟之目的，必需由國民政府採定全國一致遵守之計劃，是故吾人應先打倒爲禍較深爲害較烈之軍閥，促進國民政府之成立，使之實現民治之威權，禁烟始能收效：今日限阻礙民衆生活與自由之禍害，一經廢除，則輿論勢力，必可貫澈禁絶鴉片之目的，目下軍閥未經打倒，民治政府尚未統一全國，對於達到上述目的之最佳方法，乃在拒毒團體之奮鬥不懈，繼續努力於調查與宣傅之運動，使非法營業，無所歛迹，雖或一時未能收效，但千萬不可放棄堅忍與不妥恊之奮鬥决心，當永遠抱定澈底不降服之政策。</p>

<p>日本阿片毒害防止會幹事菊池酉治著繼滿洲事變又起滬戰、此兩大事變、足使世界各國對和平前途感覺不安而且將使國聯和平陷入僵局、此兩案之發生其眞正之原因究竟何在、實爲我人所當研究者、爲欲使各國了解遠東糾</p>
<p>紛之眞相、明瞭其糾葛之所在、不得不從阿片問題與兩案之相關説起、</p>
<p>我日軍部所聲稱之滿案原因、謂華兵破燬我鐵路、攻我守備隊、所以不得己發揮自衛權占領滿洲各要津、軍人所説之話、果能相信乎、凡世界上具有天良者、不可不究問其事實及其是非、以人道公理爲立塲、細查其根源曲直、各國人民須恊力同心研究是非、破邪顯正、此乃爲維持世界和平及爲人類造福之正道也、</p>
<p>若盲從輕舉妄動者之行爲而誤國家之前途、或任其横行侵略行爲、國民不出而制止、則將陷國家於不可自救之危局、結果將引起最悲慘之遠東大戰、是勢所難免之事、最危險者爲忘却國際恊調精神、而欲强行之軍部及政治當局者之無節制之野心、此輩之蠢動、我國民應負其全責任而我國民知其非法而欲匡救者鮮矣、現在尚且放任軍閥越軌行爲、可謂我國民無自覺之證明也、</p>
<p>我認鴉片及麻醉藥品問題、由人道上將來必生國際間之大糾紛、自早就悔過不再做嗎啡生意招集在華做鴉片及嗎啡生意之同業者、自廢此種害人之生意、組織團體防毒至今日、遼變三個月前、我同志豫先知悉、在不久之期間内、以鴉片問題爲導因、將發生一大事變、果然於上年九月十八日夜、日本軍佔領瀋陽及吉林等地、現時日本國民及其當事者之軍部、似乎己忘其因、或者故意掩飭其眞因於人類面前、以朦蔽世界之輿論、然而、何以使日軍如此興奮、决心破壞世爲原因、實是大錯特錯、其眞因實爲日人之密賣鴉片嗎啡毒品問題也、日人之賣毒事件、時常爲中日間紛争之種子、遼案之發端、起於一九三一年二月張繼之演説、張謂、「日本軍隊在中國首要城市、袒護日人密謀鴉片嗎啡等類之毒品、流毒於中國、」日軍部以爲此言有譏誹日軍之聲譽、經日公使館要求張繼取消前言、並對日政府宣誓不再言及此事、張繼置之不理、反列舉事實、駁日軍部之要求、日軍老羞成怒、乃轉其鋭鋒攻擊日外部軟弱無能爲、以爲事關於日本軍隊之信用問題、欲以武力解决之、</p>
<p>斯時因美國飛機師飛來日本、惹起重大國際問題、新聞紙上又無篇幅顧及軍部之面子問題、世人亦失了究明賣毒問題之好機會、至六月下旬、中村大尉問題及萬寳山案繼起、日軍部喜得望外、異常興奮、謂復仇之機到矣、日軍部遂爲目前之興奮而誤日本國家百年之大計、軍部之態度亦可謂爲欲達目的不擇手段之辦法、然其過失可盡歸於日本軍隊乎、張繼之責難方法、亦不可謂無失當處、關於張氏之失當、我有許多資料、但本文之目的不在此、不必説本論之宗旨、在究明日本人做不正生意、於世界和平前途、影響甚大、爲謀人類幸福、日人之做不正生意者、應取何種决心、此爲之主要論旨也、</p>
<p>張繼所列之事、均屬事實、於我同胞實是有愧、但是日本人都做此種生意、有種種之原因伏在其中、一爲地理上之便利、來往時間短速、及交通便利、易於密輸入、二爲經濟上、勞力少而收益多、容易發財、此爲日人多做此種生意之根本原因也、因此而引起中日間紛争不絶、我深望世界有心人、注意此事、恊力講究、補救辦法、以免中日兩國民永遠相争、</p>
<p>日人所以趨於此種恶習之原因甚堪研究、以我之見解、日俄戰後日本得勝、日人渡滿謀生者日多、皆以戰勝者之威風與華人接觸、而不如華人之耐苦勤儉治家、戰争之勝利者在經濟上反爲敗者、遂不能與華人並覇營商、小資本之日本人、竟想以簡便方法求發財之路、終迷入鴉片嗎啡之不正生意、相習成風、而中國禁烟爲國策、相傅至今、因政治不修明、愈禁烟鬼愈多、至一九一一年、中英鴉片恊定成立、禁印烟之進口、國内亦施行嚴禁政策、及清國倒后、各省爲軍閥所佔、内争不息、各自謀利、禁烟令己成一片之空文字矣、處於此種環境包圍之下、中國實情、在華主要城市、外人漸見增加、鴉片嗎啡彌滿於全國各城市、其中因地理上之接近、來華之日人亦多所以做此種營業者亦日人居多、此爲勢所難免之事、</p>
<p>鴉片嗎啡等類之毒品買賣、多集中於大連·上海·神户·由此三港轉運於天津·青島·瀋陽·濟南·等地、日人在此地方做不正生意、日官衙亦有心取締管束、但爲自國民之海外發展上、不甚嚴厲、此爲日人多做此不正生意之原因也、在華做此生意者、歐美各國之人亦多、其交易數量亦遠在日人之上、因他們之人數不多、惹起華人注目之機會較少、日人所以受華人注目者、蓋爲人數多而其數目少故也、</p>
<p>華人爲毒品之老主顧、其中亦自有原因、中國歷年内亂、經濟疲弊、政治不修、禁烟制度爲軍閥所摧殘、禁烟一變爲　烟、以烟利爲軍費入軍閥之利　、加之歐戰後、歐洲所産之麻醉藥品過多、流入中國其額甚鉅、而且軍閥在各地强要人民裁罌花、所以烟害遍及全國、其慘狀非筆紙所能盡也、</p>
<p>一九二五年在日内瓦開國際鴉片會議時、中國聲明脱退、各地軍閥以爲自今以後不必再受外國干涉、大奬勵特奬勵、勸國民吃烟、軍閥得巨利爲軍費、擴大地盤、屢與内戰、國民中富裕者吃鴉片、零落者用廉價之麻醉藥品、因此華人爲戰禍、烟禍及天災、三者所困、民不聊生、其慘狀不可勝記矣、華北某農村中、麻藥中毒者有百分之四十八、其原因一半在中國政府治之腐敗、其一半須歸於日本人之販賣業者之罪、日本國民須明瞭同胞在華所爲之罪孽、而共同分負其責</p>
<p>華人觀察此種事實、新聞記者及各團體多以爲日政府在後面操縱援助、或日軍却在背後掩護意在絶滅華族、以種種方法及手段與日本抗争、喚起國民之反省、以期民族之發展、亦可謂當然之處置、但是造成中國煙害之元兇之某大國、欲以帝國主義的方法、永久壓制中國之心可謂不在日本之下、由歷史上之事實觀察、以鴉片問題爲中心之國際紛争、某大國須負其創制之功、日本之國家主義派中、有一班人們、以爲華人之民族性、優越於日人、將來恐敵不過華人、所以須以鴉片政策毒害華人、藉此維持日人之優越地位、其短見不可及也、在租界内煙館及麻藥店林立、駐華各國軍隊之行李檢查、對此種毒品之檢查甚寛、亦可證明帝國主義者之用意何在　　經過此種實際問題所發生之兩國間之紛争甚多、其數不遑枚舉、濟南慘案、與鴉片問題關係甚深、日政府剖白濟南案之原因、爲北伐軍虐殺人、日軍爲欲保僑而來、但是我國自早己明知其眞因還是在鴉片問題、華軍惡日人之原因、係數年來所結之寃仇、殺日人不過其結果而己、日僑自數年來以鴉片嗎啡之事業營私、毒害華人甚深、因此中日間發生數次之大交涉、日人販毒之事、時常爲華報所登、民衆因痛恨日人之販毒、而華軍遂殺販毒日人、而日軍反袒護不正日人、此爲濟案之眞相也、造成濟案之因者、亦是造成備案之因、但是兩國國民、尤其是日本軍部、己忘其眞因矣、如此因無人道之行爲而引起國際紛争、一次己是足令人反省、何必再三重演災禍</p>
<p>濟南案在國際聯盟鴉片會議發生一大問題、（一九二九年一月）斯時中國代表王景岐博士之聲明書中有一節論及濟案與鴉片問題之相關、其内容云、日本之山東出兵及在華日本軍隊、擁護日本之販賣鴉片嗎啡之商人甚力、爲此中國甚難取締鴉片、對此聲明、日本代表佐滕委員非常憤慨、駁云、中國委員之言、使世界人士感覺日本軍隊與鴉片問題有關、日本軍隊在紀律上未嘗受外人指斥、爲日軍隊之名譽、此聲明不可輕輕看過、此種辯論登於華報、以後華人又起排日風潮、與華人之印象甚深、不久日本國内發生一大鴉片密輪出案、所關係者有政界之人、所謂安倍義也事件是也、受彈劾之人爲田中總理大臣、久原迎信大臣及山口近衛師團長、山口師團長因此辭職、此消息傅入中國、華人愈深信日軍人擁護日人販毒、由此中日兩國間之感情愈增、遠東之大局漸告多事矣、</p>
<p>如此事實之累積、遂有張繼之責難日軍部之言、但是鴉片問題不但是人道上之大問題、亦爲國際上之大問題、爲鴉片問題所訂之條約、多歸廢紙、爲人類之保健上有重大意義之鴉片及麻藥品禁止問題、今爲擾亂遠東和平之工具、對此問題、中日兩國民須加猛省訴之於全世界、爲人類之幸福、求一完善之辦法、則本文之目的達矣、</p>

<p>▲俞棪之重要談話</p>
<p>鐵道部爲欲解釋九月一日起辦之負責運輸疑點起見、特派業務司長俞棪之·帮辦譚耀宗·等來滬、於昨日午後三時餘、假銀行公會招待各界、公開報告、兹誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>▲參加之人員鐵道部業務司長俞棪·帮辦司長譚耀宗·京滬滬杭甬兩路局長陳興漢·車務處長鄭寳照、來賓計到市商會·中國銀行·交通銀行·鮮肉業·絲光業·紗業等各同業代表、及各報各通訊社記者約數十人、至三時半入席、由俞司長主席、恭讀總理遺囑、然後由帮辦譚耀宗報告實行货物運輸責任意義、</p>
<p>▲主席開會辭下午三時開會後、行禮如儀、首由主席俞棪致辭、略謂鐵路運輸、自民十交通部與軍事當局早訂有運輸通則、惟歷因運輸之不負責任、致國内貨物、不能暢通、生産地貨積如山、消耗地無貨出售、貨物之不流通、以致商市之凋敝、因商市凋敝而社會經濟、又趨停滯、此種現狀、鐵道部本身之不謀發展、無庸爲諱、而同時轉運公司需索運費太高、亦有以致之、如北甯路每二十噸貨一車由津至平、運費爲一百四十元、今同此路程、經轉運者轉運、則案二百元、因爲鐵路之不負責任、故貨主除不得己自雇船只與小車以便運輸外、勢必多耗金錢、現在鐵道路自顧部長任職以來、爲欲解除此種商民痛苦、故積極舉辦負責運輸、貨物得以流暢、而鐵道本身營業、亦賴以發展、一舉兩利、何樂不爲、因此今日承各界代表不吝蒞臨、即欲惜此相叙一堂、對本部辦理負責運輪、加以指教云　　▲譚帮辦報告主席致詞畢、次由鐵道部業務司帮辦譚耀宗報告負責運輸有利貨主人民與鐵道本身之各點、略謂、各位來賓、方才俞司長所謂負責運輸之意義、與負責運輪可解除貨商痛苦、與發展工商各業等重要性、己甚詳盡、現讓兄弟再來以事實證明之、俞司長所説、係實在的、非理論的、因鐵路運輸不負責、實不合理、試問物交船夫或脚夫運至目的地、而中途遺失、彼能説不負責的嗎、所以歷因鐵路運輸不負責、乃發生不良之結果、（一）本廉利薄貨物、因不負責致貨商不敢販運、以生産與消耗言之、兩地俱無利益、而鐵路方面、亦徒少一筆運輸收人、（二）因鐵路不負責、貨商擇無時間性貨物、由别法運輸、例如民十三東北運津糧食、因鐵路不負責、貨商大半由東北往大連以至天津、至民十七、北甯路爲補救貨運、特與四洮·瀋海·聯絡辦理聯運、但結果貨物仍走南滿路、（三）鐵路運輸不能保障、轉運公司因此乘勢居奇、弊端不一而足、如私賣車皮脚夫敲詐、均給貨商增一層負擔、更因敲詐生意低落、兹有一先例述之、必使諸君驚奇、即南滿路一公里每年收入有十一萬元、而我國鐵路祇二萬元、相差竟超五倍、其故完全在負責與不負責之關係、所以現在鐵部積極舉辦負責、一方固欲發展鐵路本身、一方即欲解除商運痛苦云云</p>
<p>▲來賓之演説譚耀宗報告畢、爲來賓演説、首由市商會代表李如璋、次交通銀行霍寳樹、以上大意均謂負責運輸、意固甚善、惟站員要挾弊端不得不請鐵道當局在小處加以嚴密防範、次爲中國銀行金紹琴及新聞界代表趙叔雍演説、詞多相同、謂鐵道部舉辦負責運輸在鐵道及貨商方面、固甚兩便、但在轉運業亦不得不加以着想、否則轉運一業、生計勢必爲難云云、末由主席答詞、大意轉運興路局人員、對運輸發生弊端等等、鐵部己經訓令各路站預爲防範、而轉運業方面、雖有影響、但貨運暢通、能少利多運、轉運業並不會因鐵路負責運輸反致衰落也云云、詞畢遂散會</p>
<p>▲俞司長談話記者以俞司長自就職以來、爲時僅及二月、於鐵路業務方面、諸多興革、其所舉辦各端、事關國家百年大計、彰彰在人耳目、此後推行無阻、全國鐵路、定有起死回生之望、貨物負責運輸、尤爲根本上革新政策、世人容有未盡明瞭者、緣舉出問題數則、詳爲詢問、承俞司長解答如下、（問）負責運輸、在歐美當行之甚久、在中國猶屬初創、以前曾有人建議乎、（答）民國十一年運輸會議、曾通過負責運輸方案、但僅頒布一通則、至今十年、除東北各新路外、幾無一路實行、（問）然則何以此次竟能毅然實行、（答）本人辦事、向主實事求是、能做一分、即做一分、此次實因歷年以來、各路貨運、日趨衰落、弊端百出、商民受層層剥削、亦痛苦萬狀、國民經濟前途、不堪設想、爲完成鐵路應負之使命計、爲解除商民之痛苦計、爲發展國家社會之經濟計、除實行貨物負責運輸外、無他辦法、更鑒於迭次空言負責運輸、不能實行、故此次延聘專家、組織委員會、妥擬章程、務求完密、以期實行之後、一無障碍、（問）現行之運輸方法與轉運公司之辦法如何、（問）目下積弊重重、一言難盡、商人運貨、除公開非購買車皮不可外、更有所謂各站費、倘不繳納此項站費、則站員於行車方面、必多方留難、甚致不加機油、貨車中途脱鈎等、不一而足、一批貨物、累月經旬、不知何日始得運送、商人處於此慘苦情形之下、惟有向轉運公司多出運輸、請其派員押運、於是轉運公司所收之運費、有高出鐵路定價數倍以上者、譬如津浦路每十噸貨一車、由浦口至徐州鐵路運費爲八十八元、而由轉運公司經手、則索一百三十五元、試問商民何辜、須多出此數成之經手費、其資本較爲薄弱之商人、輙視鐵路運輸爲畏途、因運價既高、成本自重、銷路又非易易、於是貨物壅塞於出産之地、不願外運、而全國國民之經濟、乃益以枯　、（問）實行負責運輸、究竟有無把握、（答）當然有把握、以北甯路而論、在去年除九一八事變以後不計外、僅九個月之間、單就負責運輸之十一站而言、己增收入三百三十三萬、初步試辦、收效之宏、己能如此、倘全國一致辦理、前途希望、眞不可限量、（問）既實行負責運輸矣、何以又加運價一成、（答）以前運價、係照各路運輸成本而訂、並未將負責運輸之成本列入、目下既實行負責運輸、則舉凡貨塲之建設、倉庫之建築、篷布之購置、員工之增加、押貨警察之添募、以及其他因負責而必須之設備、并損失之賠償等、皆係鐵路將來之擔負、故成本之增重、不言而喻、（問）此後運貨先後、與車輛之支配如何、（答）貨物先到先運、車輛支配、绝對公開、倘有急於運輸之貨物、更訂有優先最優先之辦法、但此亦係恐車輛不充足時之權宜辦法、將來車輛調度得宜、務使棧無積貨、隨到隨運、則亦無所謂優先與最優先矣、（問）提貨單如何、（答）提貨單之價值、等於有價證劵、商人有資本一萬元、一批貨物運出、即以之做押欵、再裝第二批、於是往復循環、是一萬元可做三四萬元之交易、此點關係資金流通者甚大、且鐵路方面、亦可助商人做押欵、（問）既實行負責運輸矣、鐵路方面、非備有鉅額資金、似難敷賠償之用、（答）此層似屬過慮、蓋以事實言之、鐵路方面、絶不會使商人貨物受有損失、四洮路每年貨運進欵約四百萬元、每年平均僅賠七千餘元、至北甯路開辦負責運輸、全年進欵碱百三十餘萬元、賠償不過三千餘元、故此後鐵路嚴飭員司勤愼辦事、賠償是不成問題的、（問）轉運業今後有無影響、（答）鐵路絶對無與轉運公司爲難之意、但希望轉運公司勿再肆意敲剥客商、純採取薄利多運主義、則業務亦自能蒸蒸日上、（問）萬一負責運輸發展極速、貨物山積、則鐵路車輛、必不敷應用、奈何、（答）照目下統計、各路車輛、延擱誤時、甚不經濟、本部現規定一種圖案、貨運發展、即四倍於往日、亦决無車輛缺乏之虞、（問）九月一日實行後、有無其他障碍、（答）本人自問良心、爲鐵路前途計、爲解除商民痛苦計、始毅然舉辦、絶對無他念滲雜其間、各界如有高見、均請隨時以書面見教、無不盡量接受、</p>

<h3 id="c154">廢止與制止 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>廢止二字的意義，是廢除而停止之意，但是自己廢止，或被人廢止，尚没意思表明，若制止二字，其意義便有不同，是有强制執行之意，即使當局不肯停止，亦欲强硬執行，故廢止與制止二字的意義，相差甚遠，</p>
<p>昨日滬上開廢止内戰大同盟會，到各省市代表四四九人，不可謂非空前的盛會，有某會員提議，廢止二字，擬改制止二字，的確比較的更有意義，因爲呼籲和平，停止内戰，二十年來，不知閙了好幾次，但是軍閥們，一面簽訂和平公約，一面儘管開了大門，打他們的仗，這種呼籲，試問有什麽意思，這種公約，試問有什麽効力，</p>
<p>故某會員主張廢止二字，改爲制止二字，欲以請求式的而變爲强制式的，這是的確很有價值，不過槍桿子在他們的手裏，試問你有什麽方法可以制止，試問你有多大能力，可以制止，如提案中，亦有制止内戰的方法，其方法概括説來，就是不合作，試問歷次内戰，那一次是人民合作而贊成的呢，可知所提方法，其效力能亦等於零，</p>
<p>然而現在所謂内戰二字，其界説更是難言，譬如勦共之舉，所謂内戰乎，抑非内戰乎，如曰内戰，則一任共黨之到處活動乎，如曰非内戰，則居然是内戰的形式也，并且一方帝國主義者，高躣大呼，實行其併吞政策，而赤化主義者，又到處騷擾，即欲對外，亦不能併力一致，勢必有詞得所藉口，故共黨此時，也應該變更方針，高呼一致對外之口調，</p>
<p>更澈底地説，此時並非高喊廢止内戰之時，是應該高喊一致起來共同禦侮之時，若僅高談廢止内戰，如北方將領之主張不抵抗主義，數日之間，而把關外好好地三千萬人民，數千萬方里的土地，完全奉送，其時北方亦並無所謂内戰也，這樣雖不内戰，實與内戰無異，故現在所應當討論者，如何去澈底禦侮，如何去收復失地，乃爲上着。</p>

<p>— 奴</p>
<p>從九一八之後，國人又高唱抵制仇貨、經濟絕交了，因爲這次所受的瘡痕，比較來得深刻，所以它的時間性，也不至五分鐘，「前事不忘，後事之師，」我們既然知道前幾次的抵制，是暫時的，消極的，往往事過境遷，枉然耗費了許多寳貴的精神，得不到什麽代價，所以現在應該進一步的，作永久積極的抵制，就是我國没有替代品的仇貨，研究他怎樣做法，積極的趕快去造，較之單調的消極抵制，功效何啻十倍百倍，兹略仇貨中的洋菜製造法，約略的寫在下面。</p>
<p>當七八月的時候，在我國沿海一帶，去採取新鮮的石花菜（海味行也有現成可買）用淡水洗净，浸三四天，取出曬在日光下，乾後用十斤的石花菜，浸在九兩漂白粉，二錢硫酸，六升清水的溶合液中，（此液應先濾過）約十分鐘後，待菜現白色，把它取出，再浸在石灰乳裏面，不到三分鐘，放在清水裏洗净，用石白搗爛，再用清水漂淡，使原料没有别種氣味，便放入鍋子裏，加五倍的水，煑沸，煑時加少許米醋，輕輕拌攪，約半小時後，改用文火，見菜完全溶化，去火，用布榨取漿汁，將所得液汁，再入鍋煑沸，减少水份，等他變成糊狀，倒在樹盤裏，待他凝結，（這時冷度應高，否則不易凝結，）才用刀切成長約尺餘，闊二寸許的糊條，再將粗條用分切器切細，曬乾了，便成爲潔白像銀絲一般的洋菜了。</p>
<p>編者按，我想洋菜這樣東西，我國爲用甚廣，的確可以按法製造，不過待他將凝結時，不用刀切，用做線粉的方法濾出，或用做麵的機器中榨出，未識可能否，敬以質諸奴君。</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3 id="c158">改良浴室之我見 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>這裏我所説的不是以那高樓大厦中的精緻的浴室爲對象，而是就那街頭巷尾專供一般市民所使用的浴堂而言。先不妨就現有的説幾句。</p>
<p>（一）誰都知道淴浴對於健康上有極大的關係，可以説，若有人終身不淴浴，那末便得減壽，至少也得身體衰弱，這因爲常淴浴可使毛孔舒暢，因之體内之污穢亦得充分排瀉。所以淴浴乃是任何人所不能缺少的生活，决不是只限於某一部份的人們的。然而大多數的窮人，不僅是不會有完備淴浴之設備，即花幾毛錢去浴堂一次亦不可得。當然，有的人，整個熱天不能痛快的洗澡一次，冬天更不必説。</p>
<p>（二）只要你去過浴堂一次，你一定會覺得那所謂「池堂」的水過於不潔，一池給體垢染成灰白色的熱水，裏面滿集着疥瘡者。楊梅毒者在没命的扒抓。（至於所謂盆堂，雅座，特别雅座等，當然不在本文以内。）於是花了許多錢正好購買皮膚病回來。</p>
<p>（三）偌大的上海，有幾個浴堂，於是打定主意洗個澡，便得花去好些電車錢。同時因爲浴堂取費過昻，於是每一次，最少是五毛以上。</p>
<p>（四）女人不必淴浴，似乎己被世人公認：不然這未繁榮的上海，爲什麽少有女人有浴堂呢？吾見聞淺陋，而且不是女人，所以只知道四馬路有幾個似乎是爲了妓女開設的（又要重覆一句，土耳其浴室，開旅館洗澡，……不在本文之内。）</p>
<p>（五）……當然還有，可是一時想不起來。）</p>
<p>這樣看來，吾對於浴堂便有如下的幾點意見。</p>
<p>（一）開設浴堂，爲主要的社會事業之一，即是要使每一個人都常有洗澡的機會。并且使洗澡的習慣普遍到每一個市民。</p>
<p>（二）浴堂一律用池堂，不宜過大，以便不停的換水，同時又不致過於耗費熱水，每一個只能在池外用肥皂盡量洗净，並以盆掬水洗滌清潔，然後再浸入池内，以使池水不致易於污穢。</p>
<p>（三）有皮膚病者絶對禁止入内，以免愽染。</p>
<p>（四）浴堂不可取費過昻，最多以一毛錢爲限，並取締一切額外開支。因爲浴堂不必過事舖張，只消一只爐鍋，一只水池，一間坐室便可了事，大可節約資本：即收入微小的代價，亦可支持，何况漸次養成人們每天洗澡的習慣，同時人們亦有每天洗澡之經濟的可能：當然來者衆多，自然會生意興隆。</p>
<p>（五）女人的浴堂可併入一般的浴堂之内，只消另設一室，以便婦女得有平等之享受。（同時小孩亦可同等）</p>
<p>（六）浴堂須普通，甚至於每百家平均有一個浴堂。大而言之，普遍鄉村，普遍全國。</p>
<p>（七）還有，還有。</p>
<p>當然，以上的辦法，假如是清平盛世，政府負有大部份提倡的責任，然而，現在……哎！</p>
<p>本意見是以日本（雖當此「國難方殷」，或不致遭諸君加以「親日」的頭銜吧？）的設施爲傚法的，熱心者諸君，可請往虹口的日本浴堂參觀。</p>
<p>區區此誠，敬獻諸君，願諸君有以見教。</p>
<p>最後還得説：「先有健全之國民然後才有健全之國家」，洗澡能助進健康，當然便是培厚國家的能力，追述數語，以補前述理由之不足。</p>

<p>— 他</p>
<p>現在又是大雨，我將四圍的窗户全行關上，我重重的吸着香烟，我静静的耹聽雷聲和雨聲，我等候一次又一次的電光在我眼前閃爍。</p>
<p>於是我的心情又是煩亂又是恬静，於是我回想起九年前的一個故事。</p>
<p>也是這末一個雨天，那時我和友人王君閉在屋裏，任窗外雨打風吹，王君却爲我訴説他幼年的景况。丨以下是他的叙述。</p>
<p>「你知道最苦的孩子莫過於幼年時死了母親，這或許不是一般人都曾經歷過來，可是我却深嘗着這種苦味。</p>
<p>我生長於一個貧苦的農家，當然在這樣的一個貧農的簡陋的家庭中，我的母親的逝世對於我父親不必説是給了一個重大的打繫。可憐我父親只得一個早便帶我起來，自己燒了早飯吃了之後，便教我提着中飯隨着他向年間走去。他一面工作着一面爲我講故事。倦了他教我在樹蔭下睡覺，任螞蟻和蒼蠅在我身上游戲。北風吹來時我只得蜷在衣襟中哭泣。上午是這樣，吃過午飯也是這樣。一直到黃昏時騎在牛背上回家。</p>
<p>我的父母是非常相愛的，這在父親的講述中可以知道。我是母親的獨生子，也是我父親的獨生子，正因爲母親的死去使我感覺到父親仁愛之偉大。這我可以得着充分的證明。</p>
<p>有一次我給隔壁的孩子毆打得流血，當然我只得忍耐着，因爲我總想找尋一個機會報復一次，在一個黃昏時，我居然找着了這種機會，我將他的鼻子打得同樣流血，於是我勝利了。可是不久那孩子却啼哭着領着他母親到我家裏來了。那時我父親正在洗脚，只聽得那婦人指着父親説：</p>
<p>「你的孩子太可惡了，你非重重地教訓他一次不可。你看他把我的孩子打出血來了。」</p>
<p>「爸爸！」我搶着反辯：「他上次也打得我流血，不過我不像他來告訴你罷了。」</p>
<p>於是父親安慰那孩子的母親，陪小心，而且指着我吆喝，我哭了。於是那孩子得意的走了。但是我受了侮辱，我很傷心。不久我看着父親轉過臉來低聲的和我説：</p>
<p>「孩子，我並没有打你呀，你爲什麽還要哭呢？你要知道，你不應當和他們閙，你只有吃虧的，因爲你是一個没有母親的孩子呀！」</p>
<p>於是我父親也飲泣了。</p>
<p>但是他對我並不如何溺愛。</p>
<p>有一次，我從一個蒙館裏逃了回來，而且在父親面前盡量設法掩飾。父親不作聲，我覺得十分安心。吃晚飯時，他特别提醒我説：</p>
<p>「你今晚多吃一點飯。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢？」我問：</p>
<p>「不爲什麽」</p>
<p>晚飯後，父親坐在草坪中，我照例的走近他，可是他却一手拉着我，順手在屁股下拿起鞋履照着我的背上一下打來，一面喝着説：</p>
<p>「你下次還逃學嗎？」</p>
<p>「爸爸！」我哭着：「不呀，我再不敢了。」</p>
<p>這一次教訓對於我非常有效，從此養成我用功的習慣。也許這種内罰是我父親最好的教訓手段。」</p>
<p>王君停止着不説了。但是他仍是沉默在回憶中。其後我問他説：</p>
<p>「那末你終於没有繼母嗎？」</p>
<p>「這也許是父親爲着我的緣故吧。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan Dispatches Special Envoy Nomura to the US <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the situation in East Asia became critical, our countrymen have frequently pondered a question: will there be a Russo-Japanese war or a US-Japan war? Judging from past circumstances, the sentiments between Japan and Russia, and between Japan and the US, have sometimes been tense and sometimes eased, roughly the same, making it genuinely difficult to discern the ultimate outcome. However, recently, it has become clear to us that the so-called preparations for war between Japan and Russia and the deteriorating relationship are merely a smokescreen, while the deteriorating relationship between Japan and the US is becoming increasingly acute, which is undeniable. Therefore, the answer to the earlier question is self-evident.</p>
<p>Japan and the US had already harbored grievances against each other after the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, the US had shifted its focus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, strongly advocating "the Open Door policy and equal opportunity in Manchuria." Japan had become deeply suspicious of this. When the European War broke out, the US again announced that "American policy is to strive to maintain the security of China's territory and administration and to guarantee all the rights of friendly nations in accordance with treaties and international law, thereby establishing an impartial principle of commerce within the entire territory of China, in order to resolve China's perpetual security and peace." Japan was even more indignant about this. When the September 18th Incident occurred, the US reiterated its previous proposals and put forward the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty to impede Japan's actions. At this point, the young military officers throughout Japan were greatly agitated. They all felt that the actions of the US were tantamount to choking Japan's lifeline, which was intolerable. The only option was to fight to the finish. As a result, their newspapers, magazines, and various pamphlets all discussed preparations for a second world war at length. Even the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, as reported last month, openly regarded the concentration of the US fleet in the Pacific as a challenge and advocated that Japan should take the offensive against the US first in order to seize maritime hegemony in the Pacific. Military experts also studied the strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese and American navies, believing that the current fleet strength of the US was inferior to that of Japan, but in three years Japan would be inferior to the US. Therefore, they especially advocated for a quick war. Based on the above situation alone, we can see that the animosity between the two countries has reached a critical point. The US has repeatedly stated its position on the Far East for decades and will certainly not easily give it up. Japan has repeatedly stated that it will not allow any third-party intervention in Manchuria and will not allow the US to interfere, and will not make any concessions. This kind of situation has long been evident. How, then, can this head-on collision be avoided?</p>
<p>The deterioration of relations between Japan and the US has been brewing for a long time. The reason why it has not yet erupted is that the appropriate opportunity has not yet arisen. Now, the League of Nations' investigation team will soon submit its report. The time for the League of Nations to resolve the Manchurian issue is at hand. The time for the direct confrontation between Japan and the US over the Manchurian issue is also at hand. The day the League of Nations makes its disposition public may be the day the first shots of war are fired in East Asia. However, at that time, the US will have to carefully consider its military preparedness and the assistance of its allies. Japan's current courage and enthusiasm, can it swallow America and force Panama? I am afraid that it must also have some concerns at that time. Therefore, the dispatch of Special Envoy Nomura this time, although its mission is to seek the understanding of the US and eliminate misunderstandings, in our view, it is either to probe the true intentions of the US authorities regarding Manchuria or is forced by its final hesitation. Whether a head-on collision between Japan and the US can ultimately be avoided depends on this trip by Special Envoy Nomura. However, the hope is probably slim. People around the world have long regarded the Liaodong Peninsula in the Far East as the Balkans of the Orient. Now, the Balkans of the Orient is about to erupt into disaster due to competition. Will the owner of our Oriental Balkans stand by and watch, like observing a fire from across the river? Alas.</p>

<p>(Shanhaiguan) Transportation in Western Liaoning is disrupted. Passenger and freight trains are passing through the main line of the Fengshan Railway, although there have been no major obstacles. Recently, as the Righteous Army has become active again, each train is escorted by an armored car and the number of armed railway police has been increased. The Datong branch line is still open to Zhangwu. The Jin-Chao Line can reach Yixian. The Gouying Line has been directly opened to traffic, but the travel time is uncertain. Most of the inaccessible sections are in the war zones of the Righteous Army. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Over a thousand troops from Zheng Guilin's Righteous Army in Western Liaoning are very active in the Suizhong and Xingcheng areas. Recently, they have established contact with various routes and launched a three-pronged attack. One route attacks Qiansuo, the second route attacks Wanjia Tun, and the third route attacks Gaoling. Fierce battles have been raging for days. Late in the evening, they once attacked the Qiansuo railway station, surrounding the Japanese troops stationed there. Later, the Japanese garrison from the Yuguan area arrived to reinforce, and the Righteous Army, fearing being attacked from both sides, temporarily withdrew. The Righteous Army besieging Gaoling occupied the area after several fierce encounters on the 27th, causing heavy losses to the Japanese army. Later, the Japanese army from Suizhong arrived, and the Righteous Army, due to the disparity in numbers, retreated and dispersed into the vicinity of Gaoling for guerrilla activities. Before nightfall, the Japanese troops in Qiansuo, fearing an attack by the Righteous Army, opened fire fiercely as a show of force, and the sound of artillery could be heard clearly in Yuguan.

<p>(Nanjing) The Third Plenary Session was originally planned to be convened in September. However, more than ten central committee members hold military positions and are suppressing bandits in various provinces, making it inconvenient for them to return to Beijing to attend. Furthermore, as the communist disturbances have not yet been quelled, it is difficult to comprehensively plan for local post-disaster relief. The date for convening the session will be determined after the bandit suppression work is completed. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan believes that Foreign Minister Uchida's absurd speech in the Japanese Diet has completely exposed his ambitions towards China.

<p>Chiang Kai-shek Issues Three Important Orders</p>
<p>▲ Order to Military and Political Chiefs of Six Provinces to Strictly Implement Performance Evaluations</p>
<p>▲ Order to Hubei Construction Department to Promote the Han-Qia-Ping Coal Mine</p>
<p>▲ Order to the Supreme Court to Send Personnel to Temporarily Replace Hu Shu's Position</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Commander-in-Chief Chiang is stationed in Hankou this time, besides supervising the suppression of bandits, he is also paying great attention to all reforms. Today (27th), he issued a strict order to the chairmen of the governments of the six provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Jiangxi, and the commanders of various armies and divisions to strictly implement performance evaluations of personnel at all levels, in order to change long-standing bad habits and reverse the trend of fatigue and negligence. The telegram said, "To the Chiefs of Affairs: Upon investigation, in recent times, military and political organs in various provinces have only paid slight attention to the diligence, ability, and moral conduct of the staff at each subordinate level, and this only by the chiefs in charge. Their energy is limited and their scrutiny will naturally be insufficient. The chiefs of each department, section, and unit, as well as the commanders of the various army ranks and other responsible persons, are unwilling to abandon face and report truthfully so as to clarify merits and demerits and determine rewards and punishments. Consequently, the pure and impure flow together, and the mediocre and excellent are indistinguishable. Useful talents are often buried, while ordinary people compete to advance. Because of this, politics in various provinces have become lax, the downward trend cannot be reversed, the ambitious are discouraged, and the people are apathetic. The phenomenon of corruption has reached an unfathomable depth of concern. From now on, senior leaders in military and political organs of various provinces must strictly supervise the civil and military officials under their jurisdiction and thoroughly correct the nonfeasance of following old habits. Each of them should take the promotion of talent and service to the country as their own responsibility, invigorate their spirits, pay attention to the evaluation of personnel diligence, and clarify the rules for merits, demerits, rewards, and punishments. There must be a record of performance evaluation at the end of each month, and a report of individual performance every three months to serve as the basis for promotion, demotion, advancement, and retreat. In ordinary work, personnel at each level should be jointly responsible. If it is discovered that a staff member has neglected his duties, the section chief must also bear the blame. If a section or department member has disgraced his position, the section or department chief should also be punished. In each army, from the commanders of each rank to the other officers and staff, the matter is the same. Only in this way can layers be supervised and levels be controlled, so as to change the long-standing bad habits and reverse the trend of fatigue. It must be understood that those who aspire to serve the country must also start by cultivating talent in order to achieve great things and establish a great cause. Therefore, a general order is hereby issued to the chairmen of the provincial governments and the commanders of the various armies and divisions to promptly comply and supervise the senior officials under their jurisdiction to comply uniformly. The prosperity or decline of national talent and the rise or fall of politics will all begin here. In addition to separate orders, this urgent order is hereby issued for compliance and forwarding to subordinates for strict compliance, without fail."</p>
<p>The second order promotes industry, instructing the Hubei Construction Department to promote the sale of Pingxiang coal in Wuhan, stating, "For compliance, according to the letter presented by He Xi, of the Hankou temporary office of the Pingxiang Coal Mine Management Office of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, that the整理 Ping Mine feels the pain of unflexible expenditure turnover, earnestly requesting the promotion of sales, in the Wuhan market, to supply 1,500 tons of washed coal monthly to the Water and Electricity Company, 300 to 500 tons monthly to the military transportation agency, several hundred tons to the arsenal, and more than 1,000 tons of good coking coal to the Liuhegou Iron Factory and the arsenal, and several hundred tons of coking coal to the Shanghai Mint. This is a matter of cheap prices and good quality, the public will be benefited, and Pingxiang Coal Mine can rely on it. Upon investigation, Pingxiang Coal Mine belongs to national products, and in order to promote the future of revitalizing industry and to maintain thousands of skilled workers, it should be strongly promoted. In addition to letters to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, a joint order is hereby issued to the director of the department to immediately comply, transfer the order to the Hankou Water and Electricity Company, all the monthly amount of coal needed, shall be purchased from the Han-Qia-Ping Coal Mine Company, in order to promote the industry."</p>
<p>The third order involves Hu Shu, the Chief Prosecutor of the Wuchang Local Court, who violated the law and neglected his duties by releasing Liu Wenjin, the principal offender who embezzled embankment funds. Chiang ordered the provincial government to arrest Hu and hand him over to the military law office for detention. Because people's lawsuits cannot be stopped, Chiang ordered the Hubei High Court Procuratorate on the 27th to quickly send a senior prosecutor to temporarily replace the Chief Prosecutor of the Wuchang Local Court. The original order to the prosecutor stated, "This Commander-in-Chief has always advocated maintaining the judiciary. This time, Hu Shu violated the law and neglected his duties. For the sake of rectifying officialdom, he cannot but be temporarily detained. However, people's lawsuits cannot be stopped. It is hereby ordered that the procuratorate quickly send a senior prosecutor to temporarily replace the Chief Prosecutor of the Wuchang Local Court so that lawsuits can proceed and the people will not be delayed. This is of utmost importance. This order." (August 27th)</p>

<p>Changsha Citizens' Daily Newspaper Resumes Publication</p>
<p>▲ He Jian Orders Resumption of Publication and Release of People</p>
<p>▲ All Newspapers Resume Original State</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Changsha Citizens' Daily Newspaper was sealed because of its published current affairs commentary, which criticized Hu Da, the commander of the provincial capital's garrison. Hu actually sealed the newspaper and arrested the editor-in-chief Jiang Shoushi, causing an uproar. The Changsha Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Hunan Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, and the Changsha Municipal Federation of Groups held a joint meeting on the 23rd and decided to request He Jian to respect the New Federation's proposal to resume publication of the Citizens' Daily Newspaper, release Jiang Shoushi, and punish Hu Da, otherwise they would go on strike. They printed 100,000 copies of the slogan "Rescue the Citizens' Daily Newspaper, Request the Punishment of Hu Da" and posted them at the door of every household to show their indignation. The Changsha Mud and Wood, Knitting, and Printing Unions also held a joint meeting of representatives of various industry unions at the Luban Temple on the 24th to respond to the resolutions of the provincial and municipal chambers of commerce. If the above three objectives were not achieved, they were prepared to strike. Moreover, since all the city's news agencies uniformly stopped submitting manuscripts from the 22nd, the sources of news in this province for all newspapers were cut off. Each day, only a special publication on punishing Hu Da was published, which caused the provincial government to disapprove of Hu Da's mishandling of the situation. Hu Da, realizing that things were going badly, asked someone to mediate and voluntarily accepted all the requests of the New Federation, hoping that the incident would not escalate. He Yuanwen, the director of the Changsha Municipal Preparation Office, and Yin Deyang, the director of the Hunan Telecommunications Administration, came forward, and together with Ling Zhang and Chen Jieshi, representatives of the New Federation, went to see He Jian and proposed two mediation methods: (1) He Jian would order Hu Da to resume publication and release the people; (2) He Jian would record a major demerit for Hu Da in the name of the chairman and commander-in-chief. However, He Jian felt that the second item would make Hu Da too embarrassed, and Hu had submitted the sealing of the newspaper for his approval, so it did not seem appropriate to punish him suddenly. Therefore, he fully accepted the first item and argued about the second item for a long time. Finally, the representatives of the New Federation relented and only requested the speedy resumption of publication and the release of the people in order to quell the anger of the industrial and commercial groups. He Jian immediately issued an order stating, "According to the request of Chen Jieshi and others, standing committee members of the Journalists' Federation, to resume publication of the Citizens' Daily Newspaper and release editor Jiang Shoushi, etc., approval has been granted. They are ordered to comply. As for the sections pointed out by Zuo Xueqian, the president of the Citizens' Daily Newspaper, accusing the commander, upon investigation, they do not conform to the facts and are the result of a misunderstanding. A separate case has been approved and ordered to be notified. This order to Commander Hu, He Jian, printed on August 24." When the order was issued, it was already 9:30 p.m. For fear that the delivery would be too late, it was handed over to He Yuanwen and Ling Zhang, Chen Jieshi, Huang Xingyi, and other representatives of the press to take to the garrison headquarters in person and hand it over to Hu Da. Hu immediately ordered his adjutant to bring out Jiang Shoushi and hand him over to the representatives of the press to greet him. Hu Da personally sent him to the Toumenkou where both sides expressed their apologies and parted. At that time, representatives of the press, industry, and commerce had received the news in advance, and more than a thousand people gathered at the gate of the garrison headquarters to welcome them. From the police department to the Citizens' Daily Newspaper, firecrackers were set off along the way, which was extremely lively. After returning to the newspaper office, Zuo Xueqian, the president of the Citizens' Daily Newspaper, and Jiang Shoushi both gave speeches expressing their gratitude for the assistance. Then, Chen Jieshi, representing the various groups, gave a speech, saying, "The sealing of the Citizens' Daily Newspaper this time was an unfortunate incident for the Changsha press. The entire society was affected by it. Fortunately, it has come to an end. The Citizens' Daily Newspaper is like a lamp that has been dimmed and relit. We hope to continue to add enough power to make this relit lamp shine even more brightly." After the speech, a group photo was taken and they dispersed with cheers. At this time, the seal at Toumenkou had been removed by the police department, and a storm had ended. All news agencies began to resume submitting manuscripts from the evening of the 24th, and all newspapers also resumed their original state from the 25th. (August 25th)</p>
<p>Second Session of Hunan Province's Review of County Magistrates</p>
<p>▲ Fifty Names Approved Awaiting Appointment</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since Lu Diping presided over Hunan's administration in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the appointment of county magistrates has been entirely based on the examination system. He Jian continued to follow the same system. In the five years since, county magistrates have been examined three times and reviewed once. The county magistrates who have been examined and reviewed have all been appointed. He Jian, because the examination procedure was too complicated, continued to hold the second review of county magistrates.

<p>Recent News on Bandit Suppression in Southern Jiangxi</p>
<p>▲ The First Army Has Recovered Areas Near Ganzhou</p>
<p>▲ The Second Army and Guangxi Army Advancing on Anyuan in Separate Routes</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, the various bandit suppression armies in southern Jiangxi have adopted a slow advance, step by step, first clearing the local Communists in the garrison areas, and then gradually moving towards the bandit areas. At present, the First and Second Columns of the Guangdong Army have recovered their defense areas before the battle of Xiong Yu. The Second Division of the First Army under Yu Hanmou has returned to defend Ganzhou. Division Commander Ye Zhao personally led the 4th and 5th Regiments of the division to garrison Ganzhou. The 6th Regiment and the Training Regiment are stationed between Nankang and Xincheng. The transportation between Ganzhou and Dayu has been fully restored, and the remaining bandits do not dare to steal and attack. Only outside the Gongshui, Zhangshui, and Yuhe Rivers, there are a few brigands. As for the Li Zhenqiu Division of the First Army, it has now advanced to the Shangyou Chongyi area, and its forward troops have even advanced to Shadi Shijing and other places northwest of Shangyou. In addition to searching and suppressing local Communists, the various units of the First Army are also stepping up the construction of the Gan-Da (from Ganzhou to Dayu) highway. The defense expenses collected in Ganzhou, 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per month, are all allocated for road construction. As for the more than 3,000 refugees in the area, they are being provided with work relief. Huang Zhinan, the current deputy division commander of the Second Division of the First Army, is the director of the highway, and he is required to complete the Gan-Da highway within half a year. The Communist bandits in southwestern Jiangxi have now retreated slightly, but most of them are still gathered in eastern Jiangxi. Bandit leader Zhu De recently heard that the Qu Shounian unit of the 19th Route Army on the Fujian border had advanced from Yongyan, Fujian, to Yongding and had contacted the Huang Renhuan unit of the Independent First Division of the Guangdong Army in Shanghang. Therefore, he transferred the Luo Binghui unit of the Communist bandits in western Fujian from Yongding to retreat to Changting, and used Changting as a barrier for Ruijin, Huichang, and Shicheng. He specially gathered the 16th, 18th, and 23rd Communist bandit armies in Tingzhou and other places, and built new-style trenches from Changting to Hetian in Liancheng, and the puppet organizational agencies in Tingcheng were all moved out of the city to Sanyuan Bridge, plotting a final stubborn resistance. According to external observations, the Communist bandits in Changting seem to be adopting a defensive posture, and towards southern Jiangxi, they have the appearance of making a second sudden raid. At present, the garrisons of the Fujian and Guangdong armies in Yongding and Xunwu have stepped up their defense, and the Second Column of the Guangdong Army under Xiang Hanping, stationed in Sannan, has planned to directly attack Anyuan to block the exit of the bandits. He has moved his military headquarters to Longnan, ordering the Zhang Meixin Division of the Fourth Division to advance from Dingnan to Anyuan. At present, the vanguard of the Fourth Division, the Kong Kequan unit, has approached Ancheng, and at the same time, the Mo Dehong unit of the 130th Regiment of the Wang Zanbin Division of the Guangxi Army in Xinfeng is flanking Anyuan.

<p>Guangdong Army Searches and Suppresses Bandits on Fujian Border</p>
<p>▲ Independent First Division Clears Bandit Gangs in Yongding</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, the Communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi have gathered in the corner of Huichang and Ruijin. The Guangdong Army in southern Jiangxi has also been advancing step by step, tracking and pursuing them. In the future, the bandit forces will be located in western Fujian and eastern Guangdong. Therefore, Li Yangjing, the commander of the Third Army stationed in eastern Guangdong, specially went to the northeastern border a few days ago to inspect the defense areas of various units and review all the troops. After Li inspected Xingning and Meixian, he returned to Chaoan on the 19th and planned to hold an eastern district pacification meeting in Shantou in September. Li had arrived in Shantou from Chaoan on the 23rd. According to a report from the border defense army in Fujian, the Communist bandits in Yongding recently came out to disturb the area. Huang Renhuan, the commander of the Independent First Division, dispatched troops to wipe out the Communist bandits in the area. The details of the Yongding bandit suppression are recorded below: (1) On the 16th of this month, the Ye Regiment reported that in the Fengrenshi area, 50 li away from Yongding City, there were large gangs of Communist bandits organizing Soviet agencies, hoping to cause trouble. After receiving the report, Regiment Commander Ye led the entire first battalion, a machine gun platoon, and a mortar to rush to surround and suppress them on the morning of the 17th. Unexpectedly, the Communist bandits had fled upon hearing that the government army was coming and had camped in Fengrenshi for three days without any movement. According to secret reports, the Communist bandits were now gathered in Tanghu Township, eight li away from Fengrenshi. The regiment commander immediately sent troops to surround and arrest them in the bandit's nest, and found many suspected criminals and various Communist propaganda publications. (2) According to scouts, there were large gangs of Communist bandits gathered in Lufeng, 30 li away from Hangzhou City. On the 17th, Regiment Commander Zeng of the First Regiment led the first and second battalions and the mortar company and machine gun company to rush to suppress them. When they arrived at Lufeng, they found dozens of Communist bandits retreating towards Huangfang. Regiment Commander Zeng, in addition to dispatching troops to search near Lufeng, immediately directed the various units to pursue. When they were about to reach Huangfang, the bandits colluded with the bandits in Huangfang Township, with a total of several hundred people, relying on the dangerous terrain to stubbornly resist. The two sides fought each other for an hour. Regiment Commander Zeng immediately led his troops to charge straight up, and the enemy began to collapse. Dozens of Communist bandits were found in the valley, and many reactionary propaganda items were seized. Although the Communist bandits in Yongding have been reported to have retreated, recently there has been news that the Communist bandits in Anyuan have broken through and gone south, and it is rumored that the Communist bandits rushed to a place 50 li away from Xunwu and harassed the area. The Sannan defense army has stepped up its vigilance in the past few days. Xiang Hanping, the commander of the Second Army stationed in Sannan, has led the fourth and fifth divisions to strictly defend and has ordered Wang Zanbin's unit of the 44th Division of the Guangxi Army, which was transferred to Xinfeng, to guard Anyuan. The two armies are in a corner, and if the Communist bandits in Anyuan break through, they will be surrounded and attacked on a large scale to consolidate the borders of southern Jiangxi.

<p>Journey to the West (10)</p>
<p>▲ No Unauthorized Absences</p>
<p>In view of the shortcomings of the previous delayed departure, we decided to depart early for Tongfu this time. On this day (the 18th), in the early morning, before dawn, I heard a loud noise in my dream. I was awakened by the noise and took the flashlight from the pillow to look at the watch on my hand, which was only a quarter past four o'clock. After washing up, I had breakfast. Everyone was energetic in the morning, and the conversation was very lively. At six o'clock, the mules and litters were ready, and we could have set off immediately. Suddenly, we heard that there was a bandit alarm nearby, and we were afraid of encountering unforeseen events on the way. We asked someone to inquire about the details, and after a long time, we learned that the bandits had fled far away to the border of Longjing, so we relaxed and ordered to advance. By this time, it was already past seven o'clock. On this day, I was unable to endure sitting in the stuffy sedan chair, and all other riding animals could not be found, so I walked with Ou Jianzhong, enjoying the scenery along the way. I only saw high mountains rising and falling, and the scenery was quite complete, but there was no water to embellish it, which made me feel insufficient. At about eleven o'clock, we arrived at Huangpu Town. Because we were too tired, everyone got out of the sedan chair to rest. At this time, Mr. Ou seemed to be exhausted and took the opportunity to hire a donkey in the town to take his place. A few minutes later, the whole team continued to move forward. I then walked with the sentries. After twenty li, Ma Xiaozhong let me ride his white horse, so I mounted and whipped the horse to gallop forward. At about two thirty in the afternoon, I arrived in Tongguan with the duty soldiers of Director Zhang of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. In terms of the epidemic situation, Tongguan is very different from Yaoxian. In Yaoxian, families died of the epidemic one after another, while in Tongguan, it was said that it had not yet been discovered. This is because Han Huanyu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, adopted the method of inspecting the epidemic at the ports and ordered the policemen standing at the city gate to strictly prohibit any patients suffering from cholera from entering the city. At the same time, he advised the people in the city to sprinkle lime water and forced them to take baths, so the epidemic disappeared. It can be seen that the epidemic is not heaven-sent, and human power can also be used to eliminate it.</p>
<p>At half past three, all those riding in the litters also arrived, and they conveniently visited the ash dump coal shop. Mr. Huang Boda bought a large piece of coal for fifty copper coins as a chemical test specimen. The miner was overjoyed that he had been given too much. That night, we stayed at the elementary girls' school, which was smaller than those in Sanyuan and Yaoxian, which made us feel a little uncomfortable. However, we heard that further north, what we encountered would be even worse. Taking Yijun County, which is 90 li away from Tongguan, as an example, there are no such mules and horses in the city. By analogy, everything else is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>▲ Coal Mining in Tongguan</p>
<p>Tongguan is a region with abundant coal mines, but unfortunately, due to inconvenient transportation, it has not been able to sell well elsewhere. Now, the total number of coal mines in the area will be investigated in detail, and the results are as follows:</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Area | Output | Nature | Depth | Condition | Stratigraphic Boundary | Direction | Distance | Location | Other</p>
<p>(1) 190 square li | 11,400 tons | Black and hard | 36 zhang from the ground | Ash black | Middle boundary limestone | Southeast | 35 li | Chenjia River | Daily output about 50 tons</p>
<p>(2) 130 square li | 7,80 tons | Bright and hard | 23 zhang | Ash black | Due south | 5 li | Huihuopo | Daily output about 10 tons</p>
<p>(3) 90 square li | 54 tons | Same as above | 37 zhang | Same as above | Southwest | 37 li | Miaodigou | Daily output about 12 tons</p>
<p>(4) 70 square li | 42 tons | Same as above | 22 zhang | Same as above | West | 45 li | Xincunwan | Daily output about 9 tons</p>
<p>(5) 140 square li | 8,400 tons | Ash black and sparse | 19 zhang | Same as above | Southeast | 30 li | Ling'erpo | Daily output about 12 tons</p>
<p>(6) 150 square li | 9,000 tons | Same as above | 24 zhang | Same as above | Due south | 42 li | Hongchang | Daily output about 8 tons</p>
<p>(7) 90 square li | 540 tons | Same as above | 24 zhang | Same as above | Due east | 32 li | Sijingke | Daily output about 8 tons</p>
<p>(8) 140 li | 8,400 tons | Same as above | 24 zhang | Same as above | Same as above | Due east | 33 li | Zhongjingke | Daily output about 13 tons</p>
<p>The above eight mines have all been mined, but mines 5, 6, and 8 have been stopped. In addition, there are smaller mines such as Yongshou Village, Xicun, Zhongquan, Liangshui Spring, Yushi Ao, and Shangdian, which have also been mined.</p>
<p>▲ Ash Dump Coal Mine. On the afternoon of the 18th, on the way to Tongguan, we took the opportunity to inspect the Ash Dump Coal Mine, which is about 5 li from Tongguan County. There are two wells open, both 180 feet deep. The two wells are 25 feet apart, and the coal seam has three layers. The first layer is 2 feet thick, the second layer is 5 feet thick, and the third layer is 2 feet 5 inches. The first and second layers are 12 feet apart, and the second and third layers are 5 feet apart. The well was opened in the 26th year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty. The diameter is about 16 feet, and it is 10 feet from the ground, built with brick and stone. The remaining 6 feet are left to nature. The coal seam runs north-south, sloping east or west about 10 degrees (coal seam inclined). Each large shift has 22 workers, including 12 coal miners, 14 or 15 coal pullers, and 4 or 5 casual workers (no fixed job). Each day, they need to produce about 800 to 900 baskets of coal (150 jin per basket). The second coal seam is currently being mined. The wages for each person in the well for each large shift are 17 yuan. The wages for the 8 people who operate the winch above the well are 2 yuan and 4 jiao for every 50 baskets. The hemp rope for the winch is 5 minutes in diameter, and each rope is 5 feet long, weighing about 1 jin and costing 4 jiao. The hemp rope must be replaced once every 40 days. The miners go up and down, and two people can stand in each basket. The coal is loaded into a rectangular basket in the well, which is 18 inches long, 8 inches wide, and 5 inches high, and can hold 40 jin of coal. The lifting is done with a round large basket, 15 inches in diameter and 15 inches deep. The coal has smoke. Local kilns have been opened within 20 li east of Huikan. The height and width of the coal lanes in the well are each 5 feet. Because the roof is hard, no supports are used. The coal is mined using the room and pillar method, and the coal pillars are 12 feet square. The annual coal production is about 20,000 to 30,000 baskets, totaling more than 2,000 tons. Work starts for 10 months each year, with 10 to 60 workers. 30 yuan are paid to the merchants each month, and 30 yuan are paid as coal tax. In addition, 10 baskets of coal are paid to the county government for each large shift. The selling price of raw coal is 5 jiao per basket, and the price of lump coal is 5 jiao per 100 jin. The burning fire method is commonly used in the mine. For this system, another inclined well is opened 100 feet below the air outlet well, and a fire is burned at the bottom of the inclined well, and the surface of the air outlet well is covered and blocked. The hot air rises from the inclined well, and the cold air enters the well from the air inlet well, so that the workers underground can work without suffocating.</p>
<p>▲ Baigong Temple Coal Mine. At half past seven on the morning of the 19th, we took more than a dozen donkeys to Baigong Temple to investigate the coal mine. The journey took about 10 hours, and we returned at about 6 pm. The road was full of high mountains and steep slopes. Sometimes, because the slope was too steep, we had to get off the donkeys and crawl up, which was very laborious. The results are as follows: The mine is located 25 li southeast of the county seat and was opened in the 11th year of the Republic of China. There are two vertical wells, arranged east and west, 20 feet apart, and each 6 feet in diameter and 110 feet deep. 1,500 to 1,600 yuan of capital has been used. The first layer has been reached, the coal is 6 feet thick, sloping northwest, and running northeast-southwest. There are 15 people in the well, including one foreman, six coal miners, seven coal pullers, and one casual worker. Each large shift is 7 days, and each person's wages for each large shift are 5 yuan, and a total of more than 50 baskets of coal must be produced. The wages for the 6 people who operate the winch above the well and the 2 people who send the coal to the pile are 5 jiao per day. 120 baskets can be hoisted per day. There is currently more than 1 zhang of accumulated water in the well, part of which is water from abandoned wells and part of which is surface water. At present, the water is being pumped out with cowhide bags, which can hold 100 jin of water per bag. Two people can pump out 100 bags of water in 12 hours. Each support in the well uses three pieces of wood, the beam is 3 feet long, the legs are 4 feet long, and the wood is 6 inches in diameter. The price of each support is 9 jiao. The wood used for the horizontal support on the two wood supports is 6 feet long and 2 inches in diameter, and each piece of wood costs about 1 jiao. The mine pays 100 yuan to the merchants each quarter, 40 yuan per month for coal tax, and 2 yuan for special tax. The selling price of coal is about 4 to 5 baskets per yuan. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Extremely Uneasy About U.S. Fleet Remaining in the Pacific</p>
<p>U.S. Watching Development of the Puppet State Recognition Issue</p>
<p>▲Reuter's Tokyo, 28th - The Japanese government is extremely uneasy due to the United States' criticism of the Manchurian problem and the extended stay of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet in the Pacific. It has been decided to send Vice Admiral Nomura to the United States to lobby and dispel American misunderstandings. Nomura served as commander of the Japanese Third Fleet after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, commanding surface warfare. He lost an eye in the Hongkou Park bombing incident on April 29th and is still recuperating.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - Naval Minister Okada, in view of the increasing tension in U.S.-Japan relations, will specially send a person with outstanding knowledge of U.S.-Japan diplomacy and naval issues to the United States. Based on the intention of the Privy Council, he requested the United States to understand Japan's policy towards Manchuria. After consulting with cabinet members, it was decided to send Vice Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo, not under the title of envoy, and this was fully understood. Therefore, an envoy was sent to Nomura's villa in Katase yesterday, and Vice Admiral Nomura agreed.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Washington, 27th - The U.S. government is considering the possible repercussions of Foreign Minister Uchida's announcement of the plan to recognize the "Manchukuo Puppet State." It is now anxiously awaiting the publication of the Japan-Manchukuo Agreement. U.S. authorities are particularly concerned about the possibility of Japan and Manchukuo concluding treaties regarding the abolition of extraterritoriality. However, in any case, before the report of the League of Nations Investigation Commission is released, the U.S. government will not issue any further statements on the Northeast issue.</p>

<p>Declares That Russian Troops Did Not Invade Manchurian Territory</p>
<p>Also States That No Defensive Works Were Built in Manchuli</p>
<p>▲Tass News Agency, Moscow, 28th - Soviet Consul-General in Harbin, Slavutsky, delivered to the Foreign Affairs Commissioner of Jilin Province a document from the Soviet government in response to the protest from the Jilin authorities. The Foreign Affairs Commissioner of Jilin Province visited Mr. Slavutsky on August 16th, stating that he had received an order from the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry in Changchun to protest that in the past December, Soviet border guards had repeatedly crossed into Manchurian territory, even approaching the Manchuli Station, and that Soviet regular troops had invaded Manchurian territory, established outposts, erected electric fences, and carried out other defensive works. The Soviet government has now sternly rejected the Jilin authorities, stating that all the points mentioned in the protest are completely unfounded or are the result of the Manchurian authorities believing in false information. At the same time, it declared that the situation in Manchuli on the border has remained unchanged for many years, and no disputes have occurred.</p>

<p>In Accordance with Procedures for Russian Mail</p>
<p>But Does Not Constitute Recognition of Puppet State Stamps</p>
<p>▲Kokumin News Agency, Washington, 27th - Regarding the issue of international mail from the Manchukuo puppet state, U.S. postal authorities recently told a representative of the Kokumin News Agency that since the Manchukuo post office was separated from Chinese jurisdiction, the U.S. side has temporarily accepted mail coming to the U.S. with "Manchukuo puppet state" stamps in accordance with the procedures for handling Soviet Russian mail because the so-called "Manchukuo puppet state's" international status has not yet been determined. However, this does not constitute recognition of the "Manchukuo puppet state" stamps, and this is not a final decision, as it is still necessary to consult with various countries in the Universal Postal Union on how to handle it. According to U.S. postal authorities, this postal issue may cause disputes. The U.S. government has decided to refuse recognition of Manchukuo, as can be seen from the State Department's repeated statements since Japan's invasion of Manchuria.</p>

<p>Budgeted Expenses 208,000 Yen</p>
<p>With Veterans as the Mainstay of Immigration</p>
<p>▲The World News Agency says that the Japanese Kwantung Army Special Service Department and the Shenyang branch office director of the Colonization Ministry, Secretary Nagai, have recently conducted detailed research on agricultural immigration to Manchuria, both theoretically and practically, and have created a concrete plan. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama of the Special Service Department has brought it back to Tokyo to discuss it further with the relevant authorities of the Colonization Ministry, so as to create a definite immigration plan, and immigration matters will be carried out according to the plan thereafter. The estimated expenses are 208,000 yen, and it has been decided to submit it to the Provisional Parliament. The contents of the concrete plan created by Nagai are recorded as follows: (1) The immigration site is located in the two areas of the Ba Hulicao River tributary, 12 li south of Sanxing Guimusi in Jilin Province (with approximately 270,000 Qing of uncultivated agricultural land). (2) Immigrants may not bring family members, and 500 men will be recruited first. (3) The 500 immigrants will be composed of 100 students from the Xideng Elementary School, which is currently training in agricultural affairs at the Beida Camp in Shenyang, 100 people who will be sent to the school from Japan, and 300 others. The other 300 people will be composed of agricultural immigrants who have already arrived in Manchuria and local farmers. (4) The immigration method will adopt the Tuntian soldier system, with veterans as the main component. (5) The immigration business will focus on farming and animal husbandry, with paddy fields only being a part of it. After the immigration plan expenses are approved by the Provisional Parliament, recruitment of immigrants will begin and they will be sent to the Eastern Provinces.</p>

<p>▲Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reports that recently, due to the internal turmoil, German newspapers have gradually paid less attention to the Far East issue. On the 20th of this month, the Berliner Tageblatt published a lengthy commentary completely denouncing Japan's aggression in Manchuria, with the main point being that the Japanese Empire has now achieved the goals it has been pursuing for the past several decades, but Manchuria's coal, iron, and other vast resources are enough to determine Japan's fate, and it is also questionable whether Japan can guarantee the open door policy to other countries. In particular, the facts of Japan's various brutal acts near Shanghai last time almost lost its moral authority and, regardless of whether it is peaceful or not, has revealed its aggressive behavior towards other countries. Today, the entire Manchurian territory is in Japan's hands, and it will soon form a second independent Korea.</p>

<p>Frontal Conflict Between Both Sides in Parliament Can Be Avoided</p>
<p>Minister of Justice Reports Truth of May 15th Incident</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - The two issues of the Rice Law Amendment Bill and the Debt Consolidation Association Law are sufficient to brew a crisis of frontal conflict between the government and the Seiyukai. However, the government anticipates that it can reach a compromise with the Seiyukai. The Seiyukai executives still maintain (1) that in addition to removing the tax-rate-based rice price in the Rice Law Amendment issue, colonial rice must be purchased and disaster relief rice must be delivered free of charge, (2) that the Central Treasury Law for responsible consolidation associations must be passed, still adhering to the party's position. Later, the government expressed its approval for removing the tax-rate-based rice price, and the hardline opinions within the Seiyukai greatly eased as a result, and they still intend to proceed with parliamentary business, with the intention of attaching a resolution of hope to the government's original proposal and approving it. Since the attitude of the majority party, the Seiyukai, has softened, the Provisional Parliament will likely not experience turbulence.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - Yesterday, Minister of Justice Oyama reported the truth of the May 15th Incident in a closed session of the House of Representatives as follows: The Minister of Justice first explained the situation of the Blood Oath Corps, and then turned to the May 15th Incident, saying that the assassination of Junnosuke Inoue and Takuma Dan continued to occur this spring. Fourteen people were prosecuted for their relationship with the Blood Oath Corps, with Nissho Inoue as the center. Among them were eight students from the Imperial University, Kyoto University, and Kokugakuin University. These people, indignant at the current situation, planned to assassinate ten political figures and ten business leaders. The plan was suspended because the Inoue assassination was discovered and they were subsequently arrested. Those who were indignant and rose up in succession were the members of the Aikyo School, proceeding with the same purpose. Twelve members of the faction and four related persons, with 00 as the leader, first contacted everything at the Koga Town in Ibaraki Prefecture through naval officers and technical school students among the comrades. In addition to the twelve naval officers involved, there was one reserve officer, ten military academy students, and one dropout. Before the implementation, 00 met with a certain person at his home on April 3rd, giving him a pistol and 140 rounds of ammunition. Thereafter, up to May 13th, 00 handed over 6,000 yen to a certain person several times. On the day of the implementation, they were divided into three groups. The first group gathered at the Shokonsha Shrine to attack the Prime Minister's residence, the second group gathered at Sengakuji Temple to attack the residence of Makino Naifu, and the third group gathered at Shinbashi Station to attack the Seiyukai headquarters. These three groups all planned to attack the Metropolitan Police Department at 1:30 PM. A certain person from another faction attacked the Bank of Japan, a certain person attacked Mitsubishi Bank, and a certain person planned to kill Seida, who tried to stop this plan. The Minister of Justice ended his explanation here, and there were no questions, and then the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Revolutionary Army Controls the Capital and Threatens Parliament</p>
<p>Acting President Flees to the Argentine Embassy</p>
<p>▲Kokumin News Agency, Guayaquil (Ecuador), 27th - News received today that Bonifaz, the elected president whose qualifications were rejected by the Ecuadorian Congress, has launched an uprising in the capital and occupied the public mansion. Acting President Moreno has fled to the U.S. Embassy. Bonifaz was elected president on October 20, 1931, for a five-year term, but because his parents were Peruvian, the Congress decided that his qualifications were not met and he was unable to take office. Subsequent news reported that the incident developed so rapidly that it has clearly become a national revolution. Acting President Moreno has changed his refuge to the Argentine Embassy. The revolutionary army has controlled the capital and is determined to coerce the Congress to repeal the resolution not recognizing Bonifaz's qualifications. However, it is reported that several groups of troops loyal to the acting president are preparing to attack.</p>

<p>Compromise Reached with Center Party</p>
<p>New Parliament Unlikely to Be Dissolved Immediately</p>
<p>▲Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 27th - The German government is currently concentrating all its efforts on completing its economic reform plan. Its manifesto was completed tonight after revisions. According to financial sources, the government no longer employs the method of forcefully issuing public bonds, but still insists on levying an industrial tax, which is inevitable, but will not affect the working capital of industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>▲Reuter's, Berlin, 27th - It is rumored that the Center Party and the Nazi Party have reached a compromise after lengthy negotiations. If this rumor is true, there will be a fundamental change in Germany's political future. There will be a mixed party occupying the majority in Parliament, and a parliamentary government will continue to exist because there will no longer be a reason to dissolve Parliament. According to public speculation, the new cabinet will have Nazi leader Strasser as Prime Minister, Brunner of the Center Party as Foreign Minister, and Schleicher as Minister of Defense.</p>
<p>▲Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 27th - If the German Parliament is dissolved within a week of its convocation, whether Chancellor von Papen will follow the constitution and hold a re-election within sixty days, or temporarily postpone the election by implementing essential policies by presidential emergency decree, remains a major question lingering in the minds of Germans at this time. Today, the Korolyev Daily commented, claiming to have received reliable information that the government, in view of the current political turmoil and the fact that the German people have experienced several election campaigns in recent months, such as two presidential elections and several state parliament and national parliament elections, if the entire country is immediately thrown into the turmoil of electoral competition again, there is a danger that may occur. Therefore, if the Parliament is dissolved, it seems that the election should be temporarily postponed for the welfare of the country, and all forces should be concentrated on dealing with economic difficulties and safely overcoming the winter. If everything goes well, it is hoped that an election can be held according to the new election law next spring. The newspaper commented on this plan, believing that Chancellor von Papen apparently no longer counts on the possibility of cooperation between the Nazi Party and the Center Party, but if this cooperation can be realized, it is expected that the president and the chancellor will not insist on dissolving the Parliament either.</p>

<p>▲Reuter's, London, 27th - The British Cabinet met today to consider the results of the Ottawa Conference, lasting five hours. Except for Herchell and Lister, who remained in Canada temporarily, and Simsman, who was en route and had not returned, Gilmore returned to Scotland due to his wife's illness. It is reported that after the Cabinet accepted the report of the Ottawa Conference, it discussed the parliamentary procedures necessary to deal with various issues. Because some points have not been resolved, the question of whether Parliament should be convened before the end of October has not yet been decided. In addition to the Ottawa affair, important domestic events such as South Ireland and India were also discussed. It is reported that there is significant progress on the South Ireland issue, and personnel from various departments are preparing everything to implement the government's policies arising from the Ottawa resolutions and agreements.</p>
<p>▲Reuter's, London, 27th - Conservative leader Baldwin gave a broadcast speech tonight, saying that the results of the Ottawa Conference were better than expected. One of the biggest points is that the conference has agreed on a revised trade policy that can truly benefit a wide area. No one in the autonomous territories or the country can now say that he has occupied invasive ground in the agreement to exchange interests, because there is absolutely no exchange issue in our will. The scope and nature of the autonomous territorial tax revisions can make Britain occupy a larger and more prosperous part of the autonomous territorial market. Canada and Australia have announced their willingness to reduce tax rates so that British manufacturers can compete fairly in their markets. This is the greatest achievement of the entire conference.</p>

<p>▲Japanese Fishing Boats Catch Fish in Shanwei</p>
<p>▲Our Marine Product Boat Robbed Near Dongsha Island</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, Recently, the Japanese not only invade our Northeast step by step, but also send warships to plunder our marine products on the sea. Near the southwest coast, there have recently been two incidents of marine products being plundered. The reason is that several Japanese fishing boats have been arbitrarily catching fresh fish in the Shanwei sea area, and using electric boats to transport fish to and from various ports. Even Japanese fishing boats have broken into the outer harbor of Mayu Port in Shantou, stealing fish and transporting the captured fish to Hong Kong, changing trademarks, posing as foreign fish, and re-selling them in Shantou and the Nanyang area. This is one thing. Secondly, Dongsha Island has always had a Chinese fishing company, but the fishing boats it sent out were forcibly robbed by Japanese ships, resulting in the destruction of the company's Dongmei electric boat and the killing of five crew members. Manager Feng of the company has reported the theft of marine products by Japanese ships on Dongsha Island, the destruction of our fishing boats, and the killing of our crew members to the Guangdong Construction Department and forwarded to the Guangzhou Municipal Government to negotiate with the Japanese consulate. The Japanese consulate replied, falsely claiming that there was no evidence and ignoring it. However, at the beginning of this case, it was reported by the Dongsha Island Radio Station, and a commissioner was assigned by the Construction Department to take detailed statements from the four injured crew members Zhou Chu and others, and the Dongsha Island Director Li was approved by telegram to re-investigate clearly, and the evidence was conclusive. Recently, marine product company merchants have re-calculated the marine product losses for this year according to the budgeted amount of investment and reference to the selling price, and the value of the loss of electric boat guns and bullets, as well as the number of families of the five crew members who died requiring compensation, and have submitted a detailed document to the Construction Department, along with the case, to the Guangzhou Municipal Government, to negotiate with the Japanese Consul in Guangzhou again to achieve full compensation in order to make up for the losses and protect territorial sovereignty. The company's request for compensation from the Japanese Consul is as follows: (1) The annual production of sea-man grass is about 2,500 dan (according to 100 jin per dan), with each dan worth about 40 yuan at the time, the loss is 100,000 yuan; (1) The annual production of shellfish is about 500 dan, with each dan worth 30 yuan at the time, the total loss is 15,000 yuan; (1) Destruction of one Dongmei electric boat, loss of 9,000 yuan; (1) Four self-defense rifles were plundered, loss of 560 yuan; (1) 300 bullets were plundered, loss of 45 yuan; (1) The families of the five crew members who were killed requested 5,000 yuan in compensation each, totaling 25,000 yuan. The total compensation required is 149,605 yuan. After the authorities received the report, the Municipal Government has negotiated with the Japanese Consul again. (August 25th)</p>

<p>▲Business Tax Bureau Extends Implementation Period Again</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence, The Shantou business community opposed the business tax, and a committee was organized by 52 businesses to request a postponement, and Wu Sihai and four others were sent to the province to petition and investigate the actual situation of the business tax implementation in various places for reference. Therefore, this case has not yet been resolved. The opinions held by the business community against the business tax are (1) that there are many special taxes and miscellaneous levies after the abolition of Likin, and the burden on the people is even greater than before Likin; (2) that the import and export tax rates of the customs have increased, and the government has defense, road construction, aviation volunteer bonds, civil aviation and other bonds, which amount to thousands of millions at every turn, burdening the people; (3) that the business tax rate is heavier than anywhere else, and the procedures are difficult and complicated, and it is difficult for merchants to do it. Director Hu Guannan of the Business Tax Bureau also knows the opinions of the merchants, but he cannot change the regulations without authorization. If it is handled too hastily, it may cause a strike. The first extension was for ten days, which expired on the 18th. Very few businesses complied. The bureau had no choice but to issue another notice extending it for ten days, declaring that there would be no further extensions and announcing the tax rates for various industries as follows, calculated on the capital amount: (1) Printing and publishing industry, (2) Goods sales industry, (3) Savings industry, (4) Barber industry, 5 per thousand for each of the above; (5) Manufacturing and processing industry (6) Banking industry (7) Transportation industry, 10 per thousand for each of the above; (8) Silver shop industry 15 per thousand; (10) Telephone industry, electricity industry, 2 per thousand.

<p>▲Residents of the Provincial Capital Are Also Panic-Stricken</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence, The plague in Shanxi Province has been getting worse in recent days. Almost all of the 36 counties in the Hedong area of southern Shanxi have been affected. According to telegrams received by the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Office from various counties, Yongji, Yishi, and Linjin are the most tragic. More than 2,000 people have died in Linjin, and more than 1,000 people have died in Yongji and Yishi. More than 4,000 people have died in these three counties alone. In the remaining Xinxing, Wenxi, Quwo, Yuncheng, Anyi, Jiexi and other places, there are also deaths every day. Although the bus between Yuncheng and Fenglingdu has been suspended, Yuncheng has tightly closed the city gates and implemented inspections, and actively defended together with the medical committee members sent by the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Office, but the epidemic is still fierce and difficult to eradicate for a while. Originally, only Datong and Hequ in northern Shanxi discovered the plague, but recently Daixian, Pinglu and other places have also had the plague, with about 20 to 30 deaths per day. Daixian is only 300 to 400 li away from the province, so the residents of the provincial capital are all panic-stricken, and almost everyone is afraid that a natural disaster is about to strike.

<p>▲ The Department of Finance Thoroughly Investigates Tax Evasion The busy canal tax in our country has accumulated too many malpractices over the years, and it is impossible to rectify it for a while, so that the people are full of complaints, and the government is also at a loss, watching the granaries, and greedily embezzling as much as possible.

Previously, tax evasion cases were also discovered in Zhenjiang, which caused a sensation for a while. It is now heard that the county government has summoned the plaintiff and defendant for interrogation. With each side sticking to its own words, it is impossible to know the truth.

Therefore, the Department of Finance has been requested to select commissioners to supervise the checking of deposits to show caution and clarify the truth. Now the Department of Finance, in addition to instructing the county government to allow it, has also sent Xu Ruzhen to supervise and urge the Finance Bureau to check in detail year by year, and report truthfully.</p>

<h3 id="e91">A Wonderful Scene from the Summer Football Tournament: Huadong Won Against Qingnian Yesterday <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>▲ Both teams have good skills and a lot of exciting competition.</p>
<p>▲ Qingnian scored first, but ultimately lost 1-4.</p>
<p>With the golden breeze and the bright sun shining on the green grass of the China Baseball Field, Huadong and Qingnian played a summer football match yesterday at 5 pm. The beautiful time and scenery created a pleasant atmosphere. Both teams had similar skills and outstanding talents. They were the best teams in the summer football tournament and had the qualifications to win the championship. Meeting on the road, there was naturally a fierce battle. Qingnian's powerful momentum was awe-inspiring, and they scored first. As a result, they lost 1-4 to Huadong. The spectators were all satisfied and exclaimed that it was a spectacular sight. The excellent performance of both teams was unprecedented in the summer tournament. In addition, the results of the other two groups were (1) Starlight won against Qiangnan, 4-1, and (2) Qinghua won against Dajiang, 7-1. Qinghua has not yet been defeated, and there is still hope for the future. The lineups and match situation of Huadong vs. Qingnian are described below.</p>
<p>▲ Huadong Team</p>
<p>Qian Jingyong</p>
<p>Wang Changying Wu Youlin Tu Kaiyuan</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen Li Ning Hu Youcheng (Yang Renwei up, Dong Xiaopei down)</p>
<p>Chen Xianglong Mao Honggui (Shi Jinsheng up, Xi Qiaosheng down)</p>
<p>▲ Qingnian Team</p>
<p>Zheng Liankun (Xin Ziliang down, Cao Chuyun up)</p>
<p>Zhang Yangmu Xu Buyun</p>
<p>Li Wenqing Zheng Liankun (Zhu Wenkui up, Wang Fengchun down)</p>
<p>Zhang Pengnian (Zhu Wenlan down, Ma Wenjun up, Shen Jinda down, Gu Yifei Zhu Xiaoyun)</p>
<p>▲ Qingnian takes the lead. The referee, He Kehui, blows the whistle to start the match. Huadong kicks off and attacks first. The momentum is smooth, approaching the enemy's goal, but they are unsuccessful. Qingnian suddenly rushes towards Huadong's goal like a storm. Huadong is caught off guard, and the defense is negligent and improper. Qingnian's Xiao Rong and Gu Yifei advance at the same time. Huadong's Chen Xianglong fails to defend in time, and Gu Yifei rushes to the goal and succeeds in one fell swoop. The audience's spirits are lifted, and Huadong is shocked. This happened within the first ten minutes.</p>
<p>▲ Huadong immediately returns the favor. In terms of momentum, Huadong often has the upper hand. Observers believe that although Qingnian is brave, they may not be able to protect their goal from being breached. Indeed, within five minutes, Huadong returned a goal to Qingnian. When Huadong surrounded Qingnian's goal on all sides, Qian Jingyong sent out a corner kick. Tu Kaiyuan received it effectively, and Hu Youcheng managed to shoot the ball into the goal. Even with superb goalkeeping skills, there was no remedy.</p>
<p>▲ Qian Jingyong's power. Half an hour later, Huadong's Hu Youcheng scored another goal. The credit for this goal should be given to Hu's kick, but Qian Jingyong's power cannot be forgotten. Tu Kaiyuan, positioned in the center, sent the ball far to the left corner of the boundary. Left winger Qian Jingyong was also originally in the center, but he managed to break through the enemy's defense and pass the ball in. His running was as fast as a dragon colt, and the audience's shouts and cheers added to his momentum. His aura was invincible. In the first half, Huadong took the lead with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>▲ Qiaosheng also scores a goal. In the second half, Huadong's momentum became even better. The activity of the forwards, the bravery of the midfielders, and the firmness of the defenders all made Qingnian pale in comparison. Huadong's Dong Xiaopei once attacked the goal, and it seemed that the ball had entered the goal, but it was blocked and saved by the Qingnian goalkeeper. One person was disappointed, and the other was surprised. However, Huadong's military power was strong, and although Qingnian tried hard to resist, it was difficult to take care of all sides. Over time, Xi Qiaosheng received Qian Jingyong's pass and attacked into the goal, making the score 3-1.</p>
<p>▲ Jingyong's header skills. For a long time, the two armies competed, and the situation was stable. Qingnian's forwards could hardly cross the line. The momentum of the ball was concentrated on one side. Fortunately, Qingnian's defenders were still working hard and could turn danger into safety. Three minutes before the end of the match, the two armies fought fiercely in front of the Qingnian goal. Tu Kaiyuan once shot fiercely, and the ball bounced back from the crossbar with great force. The sound was like a cannon. Although it did not enter the goal, it made Qingnian suffer a false alarm. However, from false to real, Qian Jingyong suddenly headed the ball into the goal. There was little time left, and the match ended. Huadong won 4-1.</p>
<p>▲ The veteran's power is undiminished. The Huadong team has many famous generals from Shanghai and is not weak. Yesterday, they showed more distinctive characteristics. People like Qian Jingyong, Tu Kaiyuan, Dong Xiaopei, Xi Qiaosheng, and Hu Youcheng all had good performances. Li Ning made his debut yesterday, taking care of all sides and showing the momentum of one man guarding the pass, and ten thousand men not being able to pass. His achievements on the battlefield are invaluable. Defenders Wang Changying and Chen Xianglong defended effectively and made few mistakes. Goalkeeper Lu Zhongen was as stable as Mount Tai, and did not need to use his hands and feet. The team was united in spirit, and their coordination was also good. They seem to have great hope for the summer championship. As for the Qingnian team, they have many new and promising generals. The team is average, and their offense and defense are excellent. There is great hope for the future.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Financial: Last Week, the Gold Market Suddenly Turned Downward, Plunging by 24 Taels, Breaking Through the 700 Tael Mark <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the gold market experienced a sharp decline, breaking through the 700 tael mark. However, there were no excessive fluctuations on a daily basis, with only occasional fluctuations of less than 10 taels. Since the silver market reported a decline at the beginning of the week, and the exchange rate was secretly flat, the price failed to rise due to the increasing tension caused by the Japanese invasion. The opening price for October was the same as the previous Saturday, at 717 taels, followed by 719 taels and 3 qian (the highest price of the week). Afterwards, the overseas silver market fluctuated, and the exchange rate between the UK and the US rebounded slightly after a few days of small gains. As a result, the gold market entered a state of hovering, fluctuating around 710 taels. As the international economic conference gradually made progress, the United States had already sent representatives, and the silver prices in the UK and the US tended to rise. The Shanghai market was also firm, but the supply from Chinese merchants exceeded demand, and hedging transactions were minimal, as they were not cost-effective. Therefore, both sides were short, and the selling pressure from major players was strong, and the market suddenly showed a decline, with dark clouds looming, plunging by more than 20 taels. On Saturday, a new low of 691 taels and 8 qian was suddenly seen. The entire week saw a retracement of 27 taels and 5 qian. Compared with the previous Saturday, the total decline was 24 taels (having fallen for five consecutive weeks, a total of about 54 taels). The difference between the opening and closing prices was also 24 taels. As for large bars and silver prices, they rebounded slightly, as the UK/US exchange rate frequently rose (by half a unit). The domestic market followed suit, and gold merchants initially delivered slightly, but continued to sell relentlessly. The UK gold price rose by 5.625, and the US gold price continued to rise by 8.125. However, the exchange rate was reversed, with the UK against the US continuing to fall by 75, and the US against the UK falling slightly by 375. The gold closing price was initially pressed down by 70 taels, and then by more than 80 taels. However, the hedging of forward US dollars was about 50 taels apart, and the spot market was still flat. The Central Bank absorbed and sold US dollars. According to a survey, there were more gold exchange contracts than before, estimated at 25,000 contracts. The long positions were mainly held by Yuanxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, etc., while the short positions were held by Hengxing, Tongtaichang, Hengxingyuan, Yuanmaoyong, etc. According to Reuters on the 28th (yesterday), the price of large silver bars rose slightly again. Observing the situation, the gold market may still undergo a change. The high and low prices of the UK and US silver markets and exchange rates are listed below:</p>
<p>Type Highest Lowest Compared to previous Saturday</p>

<h3 id="e94">Silver Market is Similar in the Morning and Afternoon <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to it being Sunday, the banks were closed as usual, causing the market to be unusually quiet. The transaction volume was greatly reduced, so the silver price softened accordingly, decreasing slightly by 1 hao and 2 hu and a half compared to the previous day's morning market, to 6 qian 8 fen 8 li 7 hao and a half. The silver swap rate remained at 4% in the morning and afternoon markets. The amount of exchange bills made in the morning market was 215,000. There were no transactions in banknotes inside or outside the market. The amount of exchange bills in the afternoon market was 410,000. The amount of banknotes in the market was 20,000, and there were no transactions outside the market. The amount of silver loans and swap bills traded was 5,890,000. The amount of silver received by Qianzhuang and banks was over 24,400,000. The amount of silver received by the treasury was over 4,440,000. The amount of remittances from various places was over 400,000. The amount of transactions by small Qianzhuang was 300,000 to 400,000. The Jiangnan small silver coins were priced at 5 qian 9 fen 9 li in the morning market and 5 qian 9 fen 7 li in the afternoon market. The amount of transactions made was 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver coins were priced at 5 qian 8 fen 3 li 7 hao and a half in the morning market, and the same price in the afternoon market. The amount of transactions made was 75,000 jiao in the morning market and 10,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins also increased by 500 wen, to 433,000 wen, opening a new top-price level rarely seen before. Over 55,400 strings of coins were traded, totaling 12,800 taels of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Securities Market Remains Pessimistic, Bond Prices Experienced a Slight Decline Last Week, with Sluggish Trading and Low Volume <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Over the past week (from August 22nd to 27th), the bond market situation at the local Chinese Securities Exchange remained quite lackluster. Spot market trading continued to be extremely sparse, with a total weekly turnover of only 45,000 yuan. Among these, bond transactions accounted for only 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Although the futures market did not experience significant changes, it was approaching the end of the month, nearing settlement. Therefore, there were more swap and liquidation transactions from various parties, making the market atmosphere not entirely desolate. Daily trading slightly increased compared to the previous period, with a peak of approximately 6.7 million yuan on the first day of the week. On other days, trading mainly ranged around 4.7 to 4.8 million yuan. Only on the weekend, trading in the August series was temporarily suspended in preparation for settlement, resulting in a very quiet market with only 1.4 million yuan traded in the September series. The total weekly trading volume for various bonds was 26.905 million yuan, exceeding the previous week by more than 7 million yuan. Among these, the Disbandment Bonds, Salt Tax Bonds, and Unified Tax Bonds remained relatively active. The Salt Tax Bonds saw 2.585 million yuan traded in the August series and 3.4005 million yuan in the September series. The Disbandment Bonds saw 2.205 million yuan traded in the August series and 3.33 million yuan in the September series. The Unified Tax Bonds saw 2.015 million yuan traded in the August series and 2.16 million yuan in the September series. Other bonds, such as the 1920 Customs Bonds, saw 1.63 million yuan traded in the August series and 1.45 million yuan in the September series. The 1919 Customs Bonds saw 1.195 million yuan traded in the August series and 885,000 yuan in the September series. The 1919 Benevolent Bonds saw 845,000 yuan traded in the August series and 775,000 yuan in the September series. The Reorganization Bonds saw 975,000 yuan traded in the August series and 360,000 yuan in the September series. The Customs Bonds saw 260,000 yuan traded in the August series and 75,000 yuan in the September series. The 1926 Consolidated Bonds only saw trading in the August series, with the 1926 Consolidated Bonds at 120,000 yuan and the 1926 Bonds at 25,000 yuan. The financial market was inactive. Regarding the price fluctuations of various bonds during the past week, although the international situation was generally favorable and the domestic situation was considered stable, the overall environment could be said to be slightly better than before. However, the situation in the Northeast remained concerning. Although the invasion of Jehol had temporarily ceased, the exposed ambitions indicated that the future prospects between China and Japan remained bleak. Therefore, although bond market trading was slightly more active due to swap and liquidation activities, investor sentiment remained unchanged. Under the current circumstances, both buyers and sellers were taking a wait-and-see approach. Furthermore, the low prices in the spot market made sellers extremely reluctant. Market transactions were sporadic, and large investors rarely engaged in large-scale transactions. As a result, the supply and demand situation did not change significantly, and price trends fluctuated within a narrow range. There was no consistent upward or downward trend, and the stagnant situation remained unchanged. Reviewing the price movements, Monday saw a relatively significant drop of about one yuan. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, prices generally hovered and gradually strengthened. Friday saw a slight decline, and Saturday saw a drop of about seven to eight jiao. Overall, the decline outweighed the increase compared to the previous week. The September series of the Disbandment Bonds and the 1920 Customs Bonds each rose by approximately 1.4 yuan, while the September series of the 1919 Customs Bonds, Benevolent Bonds, 1920 Bonds, Consolidated Bonds, Salt Tax Bonds, etc., each fell by about one yuan. Other bonds experienced price changes of about half a yuan or less. Judging from the market situation, the current state remains extremely chaotic, and the future prospects are not yet overly optimistic. The following table lists the high and low prices and price changes of various bonds during the past week (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>| Bond     | Series   | Highest (Day) | Lowest (Day) | Range  | Change from Previous Week |</p>

<p>[P The Cotton Yarn Market Rises Sharply Last Week</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has been rising sharply in the past week, mainly due to the continuous increase in American cotton prices, which has stirred up market sentiment. However, actual sales have not been very smooth because the domestic economy is still difficult to fully ease, resulting in weaker purchasing power from various parties. Only buyers from Sichuan, Guangdong, and inland areas have shown stronger purchasing power, while others are secondary. It is estimated that a total of 10,305 bales were purchased by various parties throughout the week, with prices increasing by one to two liang. Buyers of standard yarn have maintained a very strong attitude, with high expectations reaching their peak. Therefore, they seize every opportunity to buy when prices fall, accumulating increasing amounts. The total transaction volume of standard yarn for the entire week is estimated at 211,650 bales, with prices for each month increasing by three liang and one, two, three, four, or five qian compared to the previous week. The following is a breakdown of the bale numbers purchased by various parties:</p>
<p>| Region   | Bales | Region   | Bales | Region   | Bales | Region   | Bales |</p>
<p>| -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- |</p>
<p>| Sichuan  | 3,650 | Inland   | 2,530 | Changsha | 225   | Zhenjiang | 25    |</p>

<h3 id="e96">The Standard Cotton Market Has Been Advancing on a High Trajectory All Week <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market has been advancing on a high trajectory all week, with the situation showing a rapid and vigorous upward trend. American cotton prices have been soaring continuously, with the distant months approaching the 10-cent mark, and spot prices have risen by 160 points per pound compared to the previous week. This situation can be described as extremely sharp. Fortunately, gold prices have been declining, and the silver market has been loosening, resulting in a slight easing of hidden costs. As a result, local cotton merchants have been actively absorbing supplies, and the bullish sentiment has been particularly strong, leading to a step-by-step increase in market prices. However, the large short positions of a certain major merchant remain unchanged, with no intention of covering. Prices for standard cotton in various months have increased by one to two liang compared to the previous week, with a transaction volume estimated at 677,500 dan. American cotton prices have increased by 160 points per pound compared to the previous week. The following lists the current cotton purchased by various factories:</p>
<p>| Cotton Type | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Transaction Volume | Series |</p>

<p>[P Grain Market Easing Continuously</p>
<p>▲ Although few goods arrived in Shanghai South yesterday from various regions, only about ten ships arrived. There was still ample storage in Pudong, and sales in urban and rural stores were sluggish. New goods arrived vigorously, but prices were also affected by the weakening of the Zhazi market, the irregularity of thicknesses, and the shortage of foreign silver. The sale of refined goods from Luzhou was also rare, and the market was mediocre. New japonica rice lacked flavor, and prices fell by three jiao.</p>
<p>▲ Over twenty ships from the Xinzha West Road source, trade in this street felt increasingly stagnant. Changxi and Beigeng Zhongguan both fell by two or three jiao, with prices converted to silver dollars remaining stable. The market lacked upward or downward movement. Early and late rice goods in villages and rural areas moved slightly, with prices increasing by one jiao. New japonica rice fell in price similarly to the South Market, refined goods from Yangdu were in short supply, and market sentiment continued to be bullish.</p>

<p>▲ Scarce Inventory Cannot Meet Demand:: European Demand Remains Strong, Shortages Cause Prices to Rise</p>
<p>▲ The Best Situation in Nearly Two Years:: Future Prospects Gradually Appear Optimistic</p>
<p>Last week, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market almost flourished. European and American silk weavers, seeing that the world economy was gradually recovering and silk product sales were improving, and that cocoon production in various silk-producing countries was poor this year, with production not meeting sales, and fearing a silk shortage in the future, began to buy spot and futures silk. Suddenly, the market atmosphere became bullish and silk prices rose sharply. During the past week, overseas yellow and white silk transactions remained strong. The rising trend in the New York and Lyon raw silk markets had not stopped, and Yokohama silk also continued to rise. Chinese silk merchants believed that raw materials were scarce and predicted that raw silk production would not meet demand. They maintained a firm attitude, believing that shortages and price increases were a natural trend in the market. Spot and futures silk transactions remained brisk during the past week, and prices generally trended upwards. Spot silk exports reached over 2,000 bales, which was the best situation in nearly two years. Future prospects gradually appeared optimistic. The following table lists the prices of European, American, and Chinese silk at the end of last week (New York: price per pound in gold dollars; Lyon: price per kilogram in francs):</p>

<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>The three provinces of the Northeast, mired in deep water and intense heat, are, to put it sadly, nearing their "anniversary." Hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers in the Northeast are hoping that the inland will quickly send a large army to recover the lost territory. How eagerly do these brave soldiers, a mixture of iron and blood, await the revival of their motherland? When the sorghum fields rise, they take advantage of the situation to attack the enemy troops everywhere, causing chaos and disarray among the enemy forces. They swallowed the treasure of the three Northeast provinces in one gulp, but they never thought that in the depths of those mountains and forests, there would be a group of brave soldiers who do not cry out in pain when injured, and who are not afraid to rush forward and die, constantly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy troops and achieving surprising victories everywhere. The dwarfs, upon hearing the sound of the old northeast wind and the old gang leaders, are so frightened that they lose their courage and souls. They thought they had seized the treasure of the three Northeast provinces, but they never thought it was a fierce bomb buried deep inside!</p>
<p>In July, this group of Northeast soldiers, who were rolling in blood and sand, according to the enemy's own transmission, attacked in various places a total of 1,036 times. We can imagine that each time, in that pitch-black night, the soldiers crawling in the sorghum fields, upon seeing the enemy, disregard their own lives and charge towards the enemy. Head falling, arm breaking, they really disregard it, and even if the entire army is wiped out, it is only to earn the enemy's triumphant sneer: the clash of bullets and flesh and blood bursts out the soul of the inherent nation for thousands of years!</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, the new national hero, did indeed wait silently for a year, and the brave soldiers in the deep mountains and forests of various places also remotely led the large army in the inland with concern. Do you really think that the soul of this nation, this group of agile northeastern soldiers like rabbits, that the enemy's sharp weapons, the iron birds flying in the air, and the 250-pound bombs, really cannot conquer this group of brave soldiers with exhausted ammunition and few guns?</p>
<p>With the "anniversary" of the Northeast fast approaching, who should this responsibility be placed on?</p>

<p>"Qi Ziqing and the Dumb Boy Never Say Nice Things" is a proverb mentioned in the blind storyteller's novel *Double Gold Ingots*. The story involves Miss Wang San from Yangzhou coming to Suzhou to file a lawsuit. She seeks refuge with the famous lawyer Qi Ziqing, a scholar from Wu County, in Yinguo Lane in the city. The painting servant Xiaoguan's nonsensical ramblings are a story from the Ming Dynasty. According to *Records Gleaned from the Wild* by people from Changzhou and *Tea Fragrance Studio Miscellany* by Yu Quyuan of Deqing, Qi Ziqing was a real person. He lived in Yinguo Lane and was quite wealthy. He built a study and named it Mandarin Duck, planting plum blossoms all around the house, located to the right of the Sitong Bridge. Gu Xiajun (Silin), a jinshi from Changzhou during the Qing Dynasty under the Qianlong Emperor, owned Xiuye Thatched Cottage, also known as the Five Hundred Plum Blossom Cottage, in Luqiu Fang. Luqiu Fang and Yinguo Lane were located behind and in front of each other. During the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, Gu's Xiuye plum blossoms might have been Qi's Mandarin Duck plum blossoms. The *Double Gold Ingots* novel states that Miss Wang San recognized Qi Ziqing as her maternal uncle, and wrote a complaint at the entrance of Dacheng Fang to seek justice. Qi Ziqing was described as poor, bored, and with a strong sour smell, which is completely inconsistent with the records of Chu and Yu. However, the proverb "Xiaoguan of the Qi Ziqing chapter never says nice things" in the *Double Gold Ingots* all comes from the capital. Xiaoguan was Qi Ziqing's servant. Homes in Wuxi were called "Du" by the people of Suzhou, which is a colloquial term.</p>

<p>"Walk Through the Three Passes and Six Docks" Mencius said, "In ancient times, the purpose of passes was to defend against violence. Today, the purpose of passes is to perpetrate violence." This was already the case during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, let alone later generations. Suzhou was the old capital of Helu. The flowers and plants of the Wu Palace are praised as beautiful in the southeast. The green waters and green mountains are praised as beautiful in ancient and modern times. The city is thirty-six miles around, with eight dry gates and eight water gates, corresponding to the eight winds and eight trigrams. Wu Zixu supervised the construction, and the facilities were comprehensive. Other cities could not compare. Originally, there were three passes and six docks, with all kinds of goods gathered and merchants gathered like clouds. Hence, there was the saying "Golden Chang Gate, Silver Xu Gate, Copper Qi Gate, Iron Feng Gate." One of the three passes was the Hushu Pass, one was the Tieling Pass, and one was the Jiming Pass. The sites of the passes still exist today. One of the six docks was the Wanren Dock, mistakenly referred to as the Prisoner Dock. During the Qing Dynasty, the sixty-three prefectures and counties of the outer provinces escorted civil and criminal heavy prisoners to the province for trial at the Niexian Yamen. They had to arrive by waterway and disembark at the Wanren Dock. Hence, the rumor that it was the Prisoner Dock. One was the Jieguanting Dock at the Wannian Bridge in the Xu Gate. All officials who took office from other places had to disembark here, hence the name Jieguan Dock. When asked about the remaining four docks, even the old men with white hair stared blankly and could not answer.</p>

<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>The widespread and rapid spread of the cholera epidemic this year is unprecedented in recent times. According to the areas affected by the epidemic announced by the Department of Health, it has reached fifteen provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Chahar, and Sichuan. The extent of the spread cannot be said to be narrow. Yesterday, Yunbing came from western Sichuan and disembarked at Xingteng Wharf. He talked about the recent situation of the cholera epidemic in Neijiang, Sichuan. Its rampant and tragic nature is truly terrifying. I am recording it on the left to assist the discussion.</p>
<p>Due to abnormal weather, a cholera epidemic broke out in Neijiang. In twenty days, more than 3,000 people died. The Wang Xueyuan Regiment, which was transferred from Longchang to Neijiang, arrived at the end of July. Within three days, more than ninety people died, so they moved to another village to avoid it. Currently, the county seat is experiencing a shortage of coffins due to the large number of deaths. Many people use bed boards to convert coffins. Most of the dead are poor. Some wrap corpses in cotton blankets or straw mats for soft burials. Some use large wooden boxes to carry the corpses of children. Many families have been completely wiped out. Someone named Liu asked a friend in a teahouse, "How many corpses were carried out of Zhongjie this morning?" The friend replied, "Sixty-four corpses." While Liu was talking and laughing, he suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness. His friend initially thought it was a joke, but when he saw his face change color, he sought medical treatment. Before the doctor arrived, Liu had already died. Also, the Taoist Zhao Longwen went to Longyuan to perform rituals. Three people died in A's family, two in B's family, and one in C's family. When the Taoist was performing rituals in B's house, he fell to the ground and could not get up. The owner thought he was performing rituals. After a long time, they called him but he did not respond. He was breathless and his body was cold. There was also a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner named Yang Zhihou. He diagnosed six people with the epidemic in someone's home. Before the diagnosis was completed and the prescription was written, the doctor said, "I will surely die after I go home.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Random Thoughts <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>The Northeast has fallen for a year now. The honorable officials are still clinging to the dream of a fragmented peace, relying solely on the volunteer army organized by remnants of outlaws, fighting in the white waters and black mountains, using their flesh and blood against the enemy's aircraft and heavy artillery,</p>
<p>fighting for the final victory. They bathe in blood and fight fiercely, falling one after another. Such commendable and tearful deeds are met with sighs of sorrow and generous donations from all those with a sense of justice and patriotism, to show their sincere sympathy and shared hatred for the enemy. However, the banking sector in our Suzhou area has not a single bank that assists in collecting donations for the Northeast Volunteer Army, as if they were strangers from Qin and Yue, indifferent and unrelated. Since the September 18th Incident, Suzhou's banking sector has never donated more than a hundred yuan. Only when the 19th Route Army retreated to the second line of defense and Japanese aircraft frequently came to inspect, did they urgently request the authorities to dismantle the fire watchtower to avoid attracting the attention of Japanese aircraft. "We are not responsible for the country's demise." Unexpectedly, the bankers of Suzhou also share the ambition of great men. How admirable!</p>
<p>The bloodstains in Wusong and Zhabei are still fresh. The ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai have already resumed their extravagant and decadent lifestyle. Modern people are competing in swimming. As a result, artistic pictorials are filled with images of healthy and beautiful misses. Looking at the pictures, one can easily dissipate the spirit of warriors. However, the situation in the Northeast is urgent, and the land of Zhu has not been recovered. The Southern Ridge has fallen again, and the situation in Rehe is precarious. Do these modern people who bathe in water still dare to flaunt their sensuality in front of others when they occasionally think of the volunteer army shedding blood in the Northeast?</p>
<p>The plague is spreading, especially in the countryside. In Xihua Village in Guangfu Township, Suzhou, more than ten families in one village have lost more than twenty people. Although this is due to the close proximity of toilets and swarms of flies in the countryside, the prevalence of superstition is the main cause of death. According to local customs, when someone falls ill, they hire a witch and send away the plague god as the only effective way to cure the disease. The main offerings for sending away the plague god are half-cooked pig heads. After the god is sent away, they take it and devour it. Eating half-cooked meat surrounded by swarms of flies, even strong people can hardly avoid getting sick, let alone during a plague. The ignorance of the villagers is indeed laughable and pitiful. However, none of the first group of people who claim to transform the countryside have given any essential and practical lectures to the villagers on this serious issue. Instead, they focus on teaching the farmers a thousand-character text that can be read in three months, believing it to be the only essential tool for improving the countryside. This is truly regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e106">A Night Sacrifice to Two Musicians by the Great Harmony Music Society (Part 1) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Jinwen of the Shanghai Great Harmony Music Society, in recent years, due to his advanced age, cherishes young music experts as if they were his own life. There is Wang Jihong, from Nantong, originally named Anxiang, who is skilled in the pipa and guqin, and personally taught by Mr. Zheng. There is also Liu Tianhua, from Jiangyin, whose skills are even more refined. He and Mr. Zheng are lifelong friends. Therefore, Mr. Zheng's expectations for the two are also very high. Now that the two have suddenly passed away one after another, the extent of Mr. Zheng's sorrow can be imagined. Therefore, he wrote a long parallel prose and, in the deep and quiet night of the twenty-second day of the seventh lunar month, sacrificed to the two alone in the music room of the Great Harmony Music Society. The article mentions the love triangle involving Jihong, in detail, which is precisely why he mourns him so deeply. As for Tianhua, he almost burst into tears. The text reads: "On the deep and quiet night of the twenty-second day of the seventh lunar month in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the old and clumsy Zheng Jinwen respectfully offers flowers, incense, wine, fruit, the Quanming qin, and the Guangling melody to the spirits of my disciples Wang Jihong and Liu Tianhua. Alas! Scholars die young, and talented people pass away early. Human misfortune is a common sorrow throughout the ages. Jihong and Tianhua are among them. Jihong studied poetry and books from a young age and was skilled in the arts. He did not change his original intentions due to the environment, nor did he alter his principles due to economic reasons. He was also an outstanding young man. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, Zhang Jian founded the Lingo School in Nantong and hired the drama scholar Ouyang Yuqian to be the principal. Jihong studied there. Later, the school was closed, and Jihong followed Yuqian to Shanghai. Yuqian, because he had plans to reorganize the New Stage, had no time to teach. So, he brought Jihong to the Great Harmony Music Society and said to me, 'This child can be taught.' He asked me to teach him in his place. I agreed. From then on, Jihong came every day. I asked him what he had learned. He said he was specializing in the pipa. I asked him to play. It was the legacy of the Haimen school. I disliked his moral character and asked him to fundamentally reform. I explained and demonstrated, and he was able to understand everything. In addition to the four-stringed pipa, he also studied the seven-stringed qin. His ambition became even stronger, and his skills improved day by day. He tuned to Midsummer, playing the dragon boats racing in the river. He played to Mid-Autumn, dancing to the phoenix leaves in the wind. The warm spring has feet, bringing the songs of birds and the fragrance of flowers. The white snow melts the cold, idly playing with the jade palaces in the sky. He was also a good material for national music and a strong figure in the art world. One day, he suddenly came to the society and told me, 'I recently composed the 'Full City Wind and Rain' melody and would like to have it corrected.' So, I played it once and asked for criticism. I said, 'The fingering and melody are flawless, but it only emphasizes the title. Wind, wind, rain, rain, rain, wind, there is no autumn heart of desolation, no autumn color of pessimism. It is a flaw.' However, what you just played is not easy to do. Jihong said, 'I am willing to be taught.' After a few days, he came again and said to me, 'The name Anxiang is too vulgar. I plan to change it to Qihong.' I strongly disagreed and said, 'The name does not need to be evil, but an ominous word cannot be used.' He then said, 'Then is it okay to use Jihong?' I said, 'It is better to use the two characters Jihong.' He seemed to agree. I immediately suspected that there was something different. Sure enough, I saw reports in various newspapers about two women marrying one man. For a time, it was spread as a good story. Some envied it, some admired it, and some were jealous of it. As for me, I was both happy and afraid. Happy because he had the double blessing of beauty, which must have been cultivated in a previous life. Afraid that a little yang energy would be exhausted.</p>

<p>Special Anti-Drug Publication</p>
<h3 id="e107">Full Text of Premier Sun's Anti-Drug Instruction <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Premier Sun's anti-drug instruction, issued when he served as Grand Marshal in Guangzhou in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, serves as a standard for those who advocate for the prohibition of opium. At a time when there is much debate, Premier Sun's instruction can truly serve as a compass for the authorities in charge of prohibition. It is specially published below:</p>
<p>In my opinion, the problem of opium prohibition in China is related to the problem of good government. The opium trade is absolutely incompatible with a national government endowed with the rights granted by the people. However, before the government authorities can implement measures to realize the authority of democracy, it is not possible to achieve effective prohibition. At present, illegal warlords not only encourage but also force the cultivation of opium within their jurisdictions. Elaborate and detailed plans for prohibition are of little use. This is because cultivating opium is simpler and more profitable than cultivating rice, vegetables, fruits, and other things. Therefore, most farmers are unwilling and dare not oppose the warlords' orders to force the cultivation of opium. The International League of Nations' anti-drug conference is about to open. The representatives of all countries attending the conference should uphold the spirit of fairness and resolutely establish strict plans to prohibit the production of opium and its derivatives (such as morphine, heroin, and other poisonous substances) in all countries. The result of the Chinese government's fragmentation has not only led to the resurgence of opium seedlings but also to the stagnation of foreign trade. Chinese and foreign merchants and manufacturers of legitimate goods have suffered huge losses. The huge amounts of money consumed by the smuggling and illegal sale of opium, if used for legitimate trade, would not only revitalize the country's commerce but also greatly improve legitimate trade between China and foreign countries. Recently, some have said that since opium has revived in our country today and poison is everywhere, it would be better to officially legalize the opium trade and allow foreign opium to be imported through customs to enrich the military expenditure. Such proposals are absolutely inappropriate. The public opinion of China, especially the law-abiding, peaceful, and pure people, is against opium. Anyone who advocates legalizing the opium trade or shows submission to the evil forces of opium, even if it is a temporary expedient, is a public enemy of the people. The current situation in the country is extremely bad, and the anti-drug movement is facing many difficulties, resulting in very little achievement. However, the declaration of war on opium must not be compromised or abandoned. If responsible government agencies, for their own private convenience and immediate benefit, lower the flag and cease fighting against opium, no matter how temporary, it is an act of treason. In short, any form of surrender to the scourge of opium can be said to be a disregard for the conscientious demands of the people. Even the bandit-like warlords who regard illegal opium as a source of profit dare not openly admit that they lack roads and convenient transportation facilities. In addition, there are frequent warlord struggles, which result in an increasing economic burden on farmers. Even if farmers want to peacefully cultivate ordinary agricultural products, it is impossible. For example, the Guangdong provincial government is extremely opposed to opium, but in addition to smuggling from neighboring provinces, foreign opium is also imported by sea. Under such circumstances, even if a good government like the Guangdong province braves all difficulties to crack down on the illegal opium trade and establish complete plans to fundamentally eliminate the poison, it is difficult to achieve substantial results due to the large number of smuggling activities by land and water. From this, we can see that local actions are difficult to achieve results. To achieve the goal of opium prohibition, the national government must adopt a national plan that is uniformly observed. Therefore, we should first defeat the warlords who are more deeply rooted and more harmful, promote the establishment of a national government, and enable it to realize the authority of democracy, so that opium prohibition can be effective. Today, the scourge that limits the people's lives and freedom, once abolished, will enable public opinion to achieve the goal of opium prohibition. At present, the warlords have not been defeated, and the democratic government has not yet unified the country. The best way to achieve the above-mentioned goals is for anti-drug groups to struggle unremittingly and continue to work on investigation and propaganda, so that illegal business has nowhere to hide. Even if it may not be effective for a time, we must never abandon the determination to persevere and not compromise. We should always adhere to a thorough and uncompromising policy.</p>

<p>Today is the 90th anniversary of the Treaty of Nanjing and the opening day of the First National Anti-Drug Representative Assembly. When we recall Lin Zexu's spirit of eradicating opium and resisting strong enemies, he was eventually exiled due to the machinations of villains. Later, these mediocre and corrupt officials misled the country, resulting in the Treaty of Nanjing, ceding land and paying reparations, opening the door to the deadly poison that would destroy the country and exterminate the race, and planting the root of endless suffering. Thinking of this, I truly do not know where to find tears. The past is gone. What about now? Opium poppies are everywhere in the southwestern provinces. The authorities in Fujian and Anhui are driving people to plant opium. Yangtze River steamers, national railways, and private transportation of drugs are as frequent as weaving. Even national defense warships, amphibious aircraft, are inevitably caught carrying drugs from time to time. In the northern provinces, from the gentry and officials to the sedan carriers and runners, the addiction to white powder and red pills has spread throughout society. The special tax in Hubei and Hunan has not been abolished, and the public sale in Jiangsu is continuing. The central government's collection of opium tax has not been successfully realized. A disguised opium management agency has been officially approved to be established. Alas! The Northeast is gone. What about Rehe? The blood of Shanghai has not yet dried, and the situation in North China is again in danger. At this time when national disasters are looming, how should the whole country, from top to bottom, sharpen its will and strive to prepare for national salvation? Instead of doing this, we are eagerly committing suicide by indulging in drugs. Lin Wenzhong's efforts have all vanished. Premier Sun's instructions are shelved. The so-called party discipline and prohibition laws are also regarded as waste paper. How can the country not perish? My colleagues, seeing the rampant spread of opium and lamenting the imminent destruction of the race, are engaged in the anti-drug movement. We deeply feel the great responsibility and our own weak abilities. Therefore, we have convened the Eighth National Anti-Drug Representative Assembly, hoping to gather wisdom and benefit widely, and to unite our wills to form a stronghold, so that the anti-drug movement will become more and more sound and achieve the goal of eradicating opium. The opening day happens to be the anniversary of the Treaty of Nanjing, so as to show that we will not forget and encourage ourselves. I respectfully write a few words to preface this special publication.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Mission of the National Anti-Drug Representative Assembly <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The National Anti-Drug Representative Assembly will open in Shanghai today. What is its mission? I believe this is what the community wants to know. I will briefly describe it below.</p>
<p>Positive Aspects (1) To realize Premier Sun's Anti-Drug Instruction Everyone knows the harm of opium and drugs. For China, it is especially the reason for its weakness. Our nation, country, society, family, and international status are all declining. Tracing back to the beginning, which one is not caused by the harm of opium? Without opium, how could China be in this state today? Therefore, Premier Sun said, "The declaration of war on opium must not be compromised... Even if it may not be effective for a time, we must never abandon the determination to persevere and not compromise. We should always adhere to a thorough and uncompromising policy." Premier Sun's far-sightedness and deep understanding of our country's problems, and his firm advocacy of anti-drug policies, are rooted in his long-term concern for the country. His benevolent words are beneficial and widely applicable. Our people should sincerely regard them as a guideline, and persevere unremittingly, without changing or slackening, until success is achieved. At this National Anti-Drug Representative Assembly, the people, without any private agenda, dare not fail to inspire themselves and wage a life-and-death battle against opium and drugs, so as to live up to Premier Sun's spirit in heaven. (2) To unify the organization of the national anti-drug movement. In recent years, looking at the domestic anti-drug movement, although it has been severely damaged by the authorities in various places, its spirit has not been diminished. This is because right and wrong have not been obliterated, and justice is still in the hearts of the people. This humble sentiment, if it is appreciated by society, is because any widespread national movement, without a unified organization, is ultimately weak. As the ancients said, "A single tree is hard to support a mansion, but the will of the people can build a city." In the past, the national anti-drug movement was unable to act consistently due to the different environments in various places. Sympathizers deeply regretted it, and those who liked to stir up trouble criticized it. Therefore, this association plans to unify the organization of the national anti-drug movement, so that in the future, we can unite our strength and fight actively, easily achieving the effect of using arms and fingers together, without the worry of hesitating or diverging. (3) To formulate a strategy for fighting against the scourge of opium in the future. The scourge of opium is like a huge demon. Its evil influence is extensive and exceeds expectations. Our fight against it is like "the Tao is one foot high, but the demon is ten feet high." Therefore, this association plans to formulate a strategy for fighting against it in the future. Generally speaking, it will not go beyond the following three paths: (A) Striving to promote anti-drug education, so that it penetrates the hearts of the people, from children to adults, so that everyone is afraid of the harm of drugs and runs away from each other, without easily trying them. (B) Formulating a concrete opium prohibition plan, offering it to the central government, requesting its adoption, and promoting its realization from the perspective of the people. (C) Offering opium prohibition plans to officials in various places who have the sincerity to prohibit opium, and striving to help them realize them. The above three points, either starting from the lower level, so that the power of the drug demon will gradually diminish, or prompting politicians to advocate prohibition, so that the drug demon loses its support and is bound to gradually die out. We aim to achieve our goals, taking into account both overall planning, so that we can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Negative Aspects Thoroughly oppose the public sale of opium and the opium business. The country has a prohibition law. Since our country claims to be a country ruled by law, we cannot ignore the law. The opium business, although profitable, is forbidden by morality and law. There is no doubt that if a private individual commits it, he will be imprisoned and despised by society. How much more so for those who hold the power of the country and rule the people? Although the calls for public sale have temporarily subsided, demons are lurking around, and trouble is brewing on all sides. There are many people who are eloquent and persuasive, trying to persuade the government to pursue drugs for profit. We should still be vigilant, consider all aspects, and not procrastinate or indulge, lest the government be unfortunately deceived, fall into the wrong path again, and make our anti-drug people unable to escape the deep condemnation of the people of the country. This is what this association hopes for from our anti-drug comrades at the beginning of the opening. As for the anti-drug issue, it is a major issue in China. The intelligence of the people in this association is short-sighted and shallow. We originally knew that we were not worthy of the great task, but a fool's idea may not be without a small contribution to the country. Gentlemen of the country, please teach us.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Dong Wenyuan on the Anti-Drug Movement of the Past Three Years <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The National Anti-Drug Movement of the past three years has entered its most critical period. Seeing the rampant nature of the opium scourge and the laxity of prohibitions, we feel the immense weight of our responsibility. We have bravely risen up to fight against the evil forces. Surrounded by powerful enemies and facing all-round isolation, we have used only our bare hands to cry out loudly. How could our chances of success be anything more than a mantis trying to stop a chariot or throwing eggs against a rock? However, right and wrong have their own principles, and justice resides in the hearts of the people. We act on the dictates of our conscience, striving to save the country. Even though we make enemies of the powerful and incur the resentment of the influential, we have indeed gained the sympathy of public opinion and the support of the people, which is why we have been able to continue our existence and fight for the prohibition of opium. This is no accident. We hereby present a summary of the association's affairs over the past three years to inform fellow comrades and patriotic gentlemen who care about the anti-drug movement. We are grateful for the care and concern shown for the work of our association and hope for continued support to prevent it from being destroyed. If so, it would be fortunate for our country's opium prohibition, and not only for the anti-drug movement. In the past three years, the planting, transportation, sale, and consumption of opium in the country have not only not decreased but have instead shown a trend of increasing. Moreover, the import and spread of foreign narcotics is increasingly threatening to seize the opium market and replace it. The trend of injecting morphine is rampant in the three northeastern provinces, especially in the area around the South Manchuria Railway. In the provinces of North China along the Yellow River basin, the habit of smoking heroin has become widespread in the middle and lower classes. In the Yangtze River region and the southern provinces, opium smoking is still flourishing. However, the scourge of red pills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is on the rise, with its poison spreading endlessly, which is truly heartbreaking. The southwestern provinces have always been opium-producing areas, and in recent years, the situation has worsened, even more so than before. Young students and ladies from prominent families are also often seen lying on opium couches, considering it nothing strange. General society even views smoking as being wealthy and being addicted as being fashionable. Local authorities in various provinces all regard protecting opium and forcing opium cultivation as their sole source of profit, inventing various pretexts and competing to follow suit. Farmers in Sichuan who do not grow opium are subjected to lazy donation fines, and villages in Fujian that refuse opium donations suffer the tragedy of being massacred. More recently, the Anhui Northern Anhui People's Uprising originated from opium taxes, and the Putian rebellion was also due to local taxes. Yangtze River steamboats and naval vessels that do not transport opium are as rare as morning stars. Airplanes transporting opium began in Guangdong and Yunnan, and soldiers in Fujian Province have also begun to imitate this. Since the beginning of this practice, the harm has become increasingly severe. Recently, even military advisors in the National Government have been found to carry opium. The Jiang'an steamboat incident involved another opium investigation. Furthermore, soldiers carrying opium are not allowed to be interfered with by police officers, and when high-ranking officials traffic drugs, the blame is often attributed to their attendants. Everyone from top to bottom is competing for profits, and the law is treated as mere empty words. To talk about opium prohibition is like seeking a tiger's skin. This is the general situation of the opium scourge within the country. As for the situation abroad, various international conferences have been convened, and investigation committees have traveled to East Asia, seemingly with a sincere intention to prohibit narcotics. In reality, however, each opium-benefiting country has ulterior motives, each aiming to protect their colonial opium tax revenue and domestic narcotic production. Therefore, the results have been nothing. The difficulties faced by the anti-drug movement under this internal and external aggression can be imagined.</p>
<p>Over these three years, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has remained true to its consistent policy, engaging in opium prohibition efforts without wavering or compromising. However, under these circumstances, the difficulties it has faced are beyond description, and the fact that work has not been able to proceed according to the original plan due to various obstacles is something that fellow comrades understand. Although the achievements of our association's work may not be entirely satisfactory, we have spared no effort and risked our lives in recent years. We dare not belittle or disregard the meager results we have achieved. We hereby present a general account and respectfully request review and guidance to benefit the future.</p>
<p>Resisting the public sale of opium has been the most important work of our association in the past three years. In just three years, the authorities have announced the implementation of public sales three times. The first public sale appeared in the spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China, promoted by Wu Liande, who utilized the gradual prohibition policy and was the head of the globally-renowned Opium Prohibition and Investigation Bureau. He gave it the beautiful name of "integrating prohibition with taxation," but in reality, it was simply tolerating drugs and collecting taxes. Our association, aware of the underlying schemes, made a clear announcement to the people of the country. At the same time, with clear banners, we expressed our thorough opposition to the authorities and urged the people of the country to wake up and resist in unison. Seeing that the general trend was not in their favor, the authorities' voices gradually subsided, and the first act of opposing public sale came to an end. Our association knew that the authorities' actions were not sincere and that a comeback was only a matter of time. Therefore, we remained vigilant and did not slacken, preparing for the greatest sacrifice to cope with the pressure and tragic actions of the authorities. As expected, the establishment of a narcotic management agency soon appeared in the newspapers. Our association persevered, vowing to never give up, sending telegrams and appeals like snowflakes. The authorities failed again. However, our association was exhausted and could no longer fight. After that, there was a period of relative quiet. The authorities temporarily lay dormant, waiting for an opportunity to act. Our association also took the opportunity to rest and conserve its strength. Between spring and summer of this year, the flames of public sale erupted again, spreading throughout the country, with an unprecedented level of rampant activity. The authorities were determined to go into the tiger's den, willing to sacrifice everything for this. Although our association faced dangers, we could not shirk our duty. Therefore, we generously intervened and fought to the death again, appealing to the people of the country and seeking assistance from neighboring countries. The authorities were eventually unable to continue, and the Executive Yuan reiterated opium prohibition and permanently abolished the evil system of public sale. This was originally official rhetoric and could not be easily believed. However, the Executive Yuan is a respected body, and it cannot be equated with the former. In addition, our association has also redoubled its efforts in investigation work. Previously, when the opium prohibition authorities intended to adopt the Taiwan opium public sale system, they sent Li Jihong to inspect it. Our association also sent Secretary-General Huang Jiawei to Taiwan to investigate. After returning, he compiled "A Glimpse of Opium Prohibition in Taiwan" and made it public to the people of the country. Second, we conducted a national survey of the drug situation, divided into regions and reaching the most remote areas, producing statistical tables. Last year, after the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, anti-Japanese propaganda surged throughout the country. Our association specifically compiled a memorandum summarizing the despicable behavior of the Japanese in China of spreading drugs to amass wealth and submitted it to the international investigation team to clarify the truth, and also announced the Nakamura Incident to dispel international doubts. Our association has spared no effort in supporting the overseas anti-drug movement. In addition to our association's Secretary-General Huang personally going to various colonial territories in Southeast Asia to promote the anti-drug movement and advocate for the organization of anti-drug groups the year before, last autumn, our association sent Education Committee member Chen Xixiang to Singapore to assist in establishing the Singapore Anti-Drug Association and went to various places to promote it vigorously. The results were very good. Those that have been established include the Singapore and Batavia Anti-Drug Associations, and the rest are still in preparation. The opium scourge in Fujian and Anhui has caused several major waves, which are deeply entrenched and difficult to reverse. Because soldiers were protecting it and officials were colluding with each other, local anti-drug groups vowed to fight to the death, but achieved little effect. Our association, feeling its responsibility, could not bear to avoid it. Therefore, we resisted unanimously, vowing to share the same hatred, with frequent correspondence and telegrams reaching hundreds of pages. However, warlords and corrupt officials resorted to delaying tactics, continuing their actions in secret, causing the opium scourge in Fujian and Anhui to remain severe to this day. This is the most heartbreaking thing for our association, and we can only sigh in vain. Our association is a people's organization with no resources for production. What it relies on to maintain itself is a small amount of funds for support. Now, as these funds are exhausted, we have repeatedly tried to raise donations, but all efforts have been sabotaged by the enemy and have not been fully successful. The enemy has a strong latent power, resorting to suppression and intimidation. Not only are those who are powerless unable to help, but even those who are enthusiastic and wealthy are afraid of trouble and dare not donate. This kind of poisonous scheme is enough to control the lifeline of our association. However, our association has not been discouraged by this and continues to run around with endless hope, still planning to build a Lin Zexu Memorial Hall when the environment is more favorable, as a model for future generations in anti-drug efforts. We are now actively handling the preparatory procedures and will implement it as soon as the economy shows a slight improvement. At the same time, we will continue to hold a more magnificent national anti-drug tour, so that the concept of anti-drug efforts penetrates the center of society. Although our association's wishes are extravagant, with the sympathy and assistance of the people of the country, what we are doing will be very easy.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Voices of Sympathy <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After the news of this National Anti-Drug Delegates Conference spread, people abroad who are concerned about China's anti-drug issues have sent telegrams to express their sympathy, numbering no less than several hundred. A portion of these telegrams is translated below. In the midst of national crisis, may the enthusiastic anti-drug comrades in China listen to these words. Browne- a friend of China- tells the Chinese people, "Being in close proximity, I am deeply aware of the tricks of the foreign devils. I dare to express my sincerity to the people of China. At a time when foreign invasions are urgent, it is not difficult to recover our lost territories and restore our glory if we work together domestically. However, there are those who attack in secret, catching us off guard. The number of adorable young Chinese who come overseas to study or work and are poisoned by them is unknown. Who are these people? They are opium, morphine, cocaine, etc. Chinese people weep bitterly at the sound of war drums from the Northeast, vowing to avenge this hatred. Why not remember that the arrival of these poisons from foreign lands is no less terrifying and hateful? Their arrival is without weapons, silent and without trace, and they have been lurking among the Chinese people for hundreds of years. The Chinese people not only do not unite to resist them but instead regard them with indifference, even taking the initiative to commit suicide by indulging in them, bringing shame to themselves and shame to the country. How can they then seek to serve the country? I am unable to serve due to illness. How is this different from a traitor serving the country? At the Geneva International Opium Commission, a certain Japanese diplomat once said, 'Among the Eastern nations that have not been conquered, Japan is the only one. There is no other reason than that it has not been poisoned by opium.' These words were spoken in 1924, but the Chinese people have never paid attention to them. Alas! The previous efforts of China to eradicate opium and drugs once shocked the world. Why did the end of doing good ultimately lead to its prosperity and growth? There is no lack of appropriate methods to eliminate opium. If you continue to work hard and never give up, complete success can be expected soon. The great and benevolent Chinese nation, if united in sincerity, will not be subject to foreign interference. The ultimate honor of individuals and the country will ultimately belong to it. What doubt is there? Chinese people who become addicted to opium abroad should not be allowed to re-enter the country, whether alive or dead. The green mountains are like paintings, and the green waters meander. Such beautiful scenery is not for these people. Chinese good mothers must be careful not to let their children stumble and fall into addiction, leading to emaciated bodies, broken souls, and dead hearts. Cowering and hesitant, yet still among the people, they are disloyal to the country and unfilial to their families. Chinese kind fathers should urge the government to implement prohibitions and protect their children. The government protects the people, which is how it fulfills its duty, for heaven sees as the people see, and heaven hears as the people hear. The people are the foundation of the nation, and when the foundation is strong, the nation will be at peace." The above are the heartfelt words of a person who sympathizes with China, wishing to see China's revival and dominance in the world soon. Let them silently pray for the permanent unity of China internally and expel all its enemies from its borders.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Telegram from the Geneva International Anti-Drug News Agency <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>To Mr. Jiawei: We have learned that your association will hold a National Delegates Conference to discuss future anti-drug issues. I humbly offer a few of my views, hoping you will consider them: (1) Firmly request the government to abide by the articles of the International Opium Conference in Geneva on February 19, 1925, and the International Conference on the Limitation of the Manufacture of Narcotic Drugs in Geneva on July 13, 1931. (2) Firmly request the government to ask the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs of the League of Nations to investigate the opium scourge in various concessions or leased territories in China, and request the governments of countries with concessions or leased territories in China to provide a detailed report on the drug situation in each concession. As for the drug situation in the Shanghai International Settlement, the appropriate authorities can be held responsible for reporting it. (3) Sincerely cooperate with the League of Nations and submit detailed annual reports to the League of Nations, because although the Chinese government has annual reports submitted to the League of Nations, there may be shortcomings regarding the opium issue for certain reasons. (4) Publish an annual report on opium and drugs in China, especially detailing the smuggling of drugs by foreign ships and the harm they cause to China. (5) Publish a special edition on opium and narcotic drug issues annually in prominent foreign newspapers in China (such as the opium special edition of the Peking and Tientsin Times in 1919 and 1920). The above points, in my opinion, may be beneficial if they can be discussed at the Delegates Conference. I hope for the best. I wish you well. Browne, President of the Geneva International Anti-Drug News Agency.</p>

<p>To Mr. Huang Jiawei, Secretary-General of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association: I have recently learned that your association will hold its first National Delegates Conference. Since I have known the staff of your association, I have deeply admired your perseverance and prudence in using the unique method of educating the public to resist drugs and save the country. Although the anti-drug work is heavy, with the strong and fearless spirit of your country's people, you will eventually defeat the demons. This must be attributed to the great spirit of sacrifice of your association. My colleagues and I are also participating in the work of eradicating the scourge of drugs worldwide. I sincerely wish your country's anti-drug work success and attach a recent resolution from the British section of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom for your reference. I wish you well. Bai Ai, Secretary of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, British Section.</p>

<p>(1) The Opium Committee of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom strongly supports the assertion of the Far East Opium Investigation Team that "opium should not be regarded as a legitimate commodity, and all opium needs, except for medical and scientific needs, should be regarded as illegal." (2) We firmly believe that government public sales of smoking opium are clearly in violation of Article 6 of the Geneva International Opium Conference, and that our (British) failure to fulfill international obligations in colonies and dependencies damages our national honor and endangers the friendship between China and Britain. (3) We also hope that the recommendations of the investigation team, (A) to limit the amount of opium smoked by addicts through a registration method in order to achieve the goal of prohibition, and (B) to abolish the inclusion of opium revenue in the tax revenue budget, will be immediately implemented in Britain and the Far East.</p>

<p>To Mr. Huang Jiawei, Secretary-General of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association: I have received your letter and am pleased to know that you are well. I am deeply honored to join your association as a member and enclose my membership card for your receipt. You have asked for my opinion on this National Delegates Conference, and I respectfully offer the following points: I am deeply gratified by the growing success of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association. I express my sympathy for the National Delegates Conference held in Shanghai and will wait and see the discussions and resolutions of this important conference. I wish in advance that it can fully realize the patriotic and humanitarian causes. Before, I was fortunate to obtain a sentiment from Pope Pius XI on the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association. (I was really fortunate, and the Pope's letter to me in January has been translated and published by your association, and it should have achieved considerable results. I follow the Pope's intention, that the cooperation between the Church and the anti-drug groups can guarantee success of the anti-drug movement. I respectfully submit this and wish you well.

<p>To Mr. Huang Jiawei of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association: We have recently learned that your association will hold a National Delegates Conference. We are very pleased to hear this from afar. Your association's action will enable people from various countries to understand their own strength.

<h3 id="e121">Opium Problems That Triggered the Manchurian Incident <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Written by Kikuchi Yuji, Executive Secretary of the Japan Opium Poisoning Prevention Association. Following the Manchurian Incident, the Shanghai War erupted again. These two major incidents have made countries worldwide feel uneasy about the prospects for peace and have brought the League of Nations peace efforts to a standstill. What are the true reasons for these two cases? This is something we must study. To enable all countries to understand the truth about the Far East conflict and clarify where the entanglement lies, it is necessary to start with the relationship between the opium problem and the two cases.</p>
<p>The reason for the Manchurian Incident claimed by our Japanese military is that Chinese soldiers destroyed our railways and attacked our garrison troops. Therefore, we had no choice but to exercise our right of self-defense and occupy key points in Manchuria. Can the words of soldiers be believed? Anyone with a conscience in the world must investigate the facts and their rights and wrongs. Standing on the grounds of humanity and justice, we must carefully examine the root causes and truths. People of all countries must work together to study right and wrong, break evil and promote righteousness. This is the right way to maintain world peace and create happiness for mankind.</p>
<p>If we blindly follow the actions of reckless people and mislead the country's future, or allow their rampant aggression without the people coming out to stop them, it will plunge the country into a crisis from which it cannot save itself. The result will inevitably lead to the most tragic Far East war. The most dangerous thing is forgetting the spirit of international cooperation and the unrestrained ambitions of the military and political authorities who want to force their way. Our people should bear full responsibility for the reckless actions of these people, and few of our people know their illegality and want to correct them. Now, we are still allowing warlords to overstep their bounds, which can be said to be proof of our people's lack of self-awareness.</p>
<p>I believe that the opium and narcotic drug problem will inevitably lead to major international disputes in the future from a humanitarian perspective. Since I regretted it early on and stopped doing morphine business, I gathered fellow traders who were doing opium and morphine business in China, abolished this harmful business, and organized groups to prevent drug poisoning until today. Three months before the Liaoning Incident, my comrades knew in advance that a major incident would occur in the near future due to the opium problem. Sure enough, on the night of September 18th of the previous year, the Japanese army occupied Shenyang and Jilin. At present, the Japanese people and the military involved seem to have forgotten the cause, or deliberately concealed the true cause from mankind to obscure world opinion. However, what made the Japanese army so excited and determined to destroy the world as a cause is a big mistake. The real cause is the Japanese people's secret sale of opium and morphine drugs. The Japanese people's drug sales have often been the seeds of Sino-Japanese disputes. The beginning of the Liaoning Incident originated from Zhang Ji's speech in February 1931. Zhang said, "The Japanese army in major cities in China is protecting Japanese people's conspiracy of opium, morphine, and other drugs, which are poisoning China." The Japanese military believed that this statement was a criticism of the Japanese army's reputation. The Japanese embassy requested Zhang Ji to withdraw his previous statement and swear to the Japanese government that he would not mention this matter again. Zhang Ji ignored it and instead listed facts to refute the Japanese military's request. The Japanese military became angry and turned its sharp edge to attack the Japanese Foreign Ministry for being weak and incompetent, believing that the matter concerned the credibility of the Japanese army and wanted to resolve it by force.</p>
<p>At that time, the arrival of an American pilot in Japan caused a major international problem. The newspapers had no space to take care of the military's face, and the world missed the opportunity to investigate the drug sales problem. In late June, the Captain Nakamura incident and the Wanbaoshan incident followed. The Japanese military was overjoyed and excited, saying that the opportunity for revenge had arrived. The Japanese military then misled Japan's century-long plan for the current excitement. The military's attitude can also be said to be a method of using any means to achieve its goals. However, can its fault be entirely attributed to the Japanese army? Zhang Ji's method of accusing is also not without its shortcomings. I have a lot of information about Zhang's inappropriateness, but the purpose of this article is not here. There is no need to say that the purpose of this discussion is to clarify that the Japanese people's doing improper business has a great impact on the future of world peace. For the sake of human happiness, what kind of determination should the Japanese people who do improper business make? This is the main purpose of this article.</p>
<p>The matters listed by Zhang Ji are all facts, and we are ashamed of our compatriots. However, there are various reasons why Japanese people do this kind of business. One is the geographical convenience, the short travel time, and the convenient transportation, which makes it easy to smuggle in. The second is the economic benefit, with little labor and high income, making it easy to get rich. This is the fundamental reason why many Japanese people do this kind of business. This has caused continuous Sino-Japanese disputes. I deeply hope that people of good will in the world will pay attention to this matter and work together to study and remedy the situation, so as to avoid eternal conflict between the Chinese and Japanese people.</p>
<p>The reasons why Japanese people tend to this kind of bad habit are worth studying. In my opinion, after Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, more and more Japanese people went to Manchuria to make a living. They all contacted the Chinese with the prestige of the victors, but they were not as hardworking and thrifty as the Chinese in managing their families. The victor in the war became the loser in the economy. They could not compete with the Chinese in business. Japanese people with small capital wanted to find a shortcut to get rich, and finally became obsessed with the improper business of opium and morphine. This became a common practice. China's opium prohibition has been a national policy to this day. Because of political disrepair, the more opium is prohibited, the more opium addicts there are. In 1911, the Sino-British Opium Agreement was established, prohibiting the import of Indian opium. Strict prohibition policies were also implemented domestically. After the Qing Dynasty fell, the provinces were occupied by warlords, and internal strife continued. They each sought their own interests, and the opium prohibition order had become a mere piece of paper. Under the surrounding of this environment and the real situation in China, foreigners gradually increased in major cities in China, and opium and morphine spread throughout the cities. Among them, due to the geographical proximity, many Japanese people came to China, so most of those who engaged in this business were also Japanese. This is inevitable.</p>
<p>The trade of drugs such as opium and morphine is mostly concentrated in Dalian, Shanghai, and Kobe. From these three ports, they are transshipped to Tianjin, Qingdao, Shenyang, Jinan, and other places. Japanese people do improper business in these places, and Japanese officials also have the intention to crack down and control them, but for the sake of overseas development of their own people, they are not very strict. This is the reason why many Japanese people do this improper business. There are also many people from European and American countries who do this business in China, and the amount of their transactions is far above that of the Japanese. Because there are not many of them, they have less chance of attracting the attention of the Chinese. The reason why Japanese people attract the attention of the Chinese is because there are many of them and their numbers are small.</p>
<p>The Chinese are old customers of drugs, and there are also reasons for this. China has been in internal turmoil for many years, the economy is exhausted, the politics are not repaired, and the opium prohibition system is destroyed by warlords. Opium prohibition has become opium, and opium profits are used for military expenses and warlord profits. In addition, after the European war, too many narcotic drugs produced in Europe flowed into China, and the amount was very large. Moreover, warlords forced people to cut poppies everywhere, so the harm of opium spread throughout the country. The tragic situation cannot be exhausted by pen and paper. In a certain village in North China, 48% of the people are addicted to narcotics. Half of the reason is the corruption of the Chinese government's rule, and the other half must be attributed to the crime of the Japanese sellers. The Japanese people must understand the sins committed by their compatriots in China and share their responsibilities together.</p>
<p>Chinese people observe this kind of fact, and many newspaper reporters and groups believe that the Japanese government is manipulating and assisting behind the scenes, or that the Japanese army is protecting behind the scenes with the intention of exterminating the Chinese people. They use various methods and means to fight against Japan, awaken the people's reflection, and expect the development of the nation, which can also be said to be a matter of course. However, a certain big country, the culprit of China's drug abuse, wants to permanently suppress China with imperialist methods, which can be said to be no less than Japan. From the observation of historical facts, a certain big country must be responsible for the creation of international disputes with the opium problem as the center. Among the nationalists in Japan, there is a group of people who believe that the Chinese people's national character is superior to that of the Japanese people, and they may not be able to defeat the Chinese people in the future. Therefore, they must use the opium policy to poison the Chinese people and maintain the superior position of the Japanese people. Their shortsightedness is beyond reach. In the concessions, there are many opium dens and narcotic drug stores. The luggage inspection of the troops stationed in China is very lenient on the inspection of such drugs, which can also prove the intention of the imperialists. There are many disputes between the two countries that have occurred after this kind of practical problem, and the number is countless. The Jinan Incident is closely related to the opium problem. The Japanese government explained the reason for the Jinan Incident, that the Northern Expeditionary Army abused and killed people, and the Japanese army came to protect the overseas Chinese. However, our country has long known that the real reason is still the opium problem. The reason why the Chinese army hates the Japanese is the grudges that have been accumulated over the years. Killing the Japanese is just the result. Japanese overseas Chinese have been using opium and morphine to make profits and deeply poison the Chinese people for several years. Therefore, several major negotiations have occurred between China and Japan. The Japanese people's drug trafficking is often reported by Chinese newspapers. The people hate the Japanese people's drug trafficking, so the Chinese army killed the Japanese drug traffickers, and the Japanese army protected the improper Japanese people. This is the truth of the Jinan Incident. The cause of the Jinan Incident is also the cause of the Beian Incident. However, the people of the two countries, especially the Japanese military, have forgotten the true cause. It is enough to make people reflect on causing international disputes due to such inhuman behavior. Why repeat the disaster again and again?</p>
<p>The Jinan Incident caused a major problem at the International League of Nations Opium Conference (January 1929). At that time, Dr. Wang Jingqi, the Chinese representative, had a section in his statement discussing the relationship between the Jinan Incident and the opium problem. The content said that the Japanese army's dispatch to Shandong and the Japanese army in China strongly supported Japanese merchants selling opium and morphine. Therefore, it is very difficult for China to crack down on opium. Regarding this statement, the Japanese representative, Committee Member Sato, was very angry and retorted that the Chinese committee member's words made people around the world feel that the Japanese army was related to the opium problem. The Japanese army has never been criticized by outsiders in terms of discipline. For the reputation of the Japanese army, this statement cannot be taken lightly. This kind of debate was published in Chinese newspapers. Later, the Chinese people started an anti-Japanese trend again, which had a very deep impression on the Chinese people. Soon, a major opium smuggling case occurred in Japan. Those involved were people from the political circles. The so-called Abe Yoshiya incident. The people who were impeached were Prime Minister Tanaka, Minister Kuhara, and Commander of the Yamaguchi Near Guard Division. The Commander of the Yamaguchi Division resigned as a result. When this news reached China, the Chinese people became more convinced that the Japanese military supported the Japanese people's drug trafficking. As a result, the relationship between the two countries, China and Japan, increased, and the overall situation in the Far East gradually became eventful.</p>
<p>The accumulation of such facts led to Zhang Ji's accusation against the Japanese military. However, the opium problem is not only a major humanitarian problem, but also a major international problem. The treaties made for the opium problem have mostly become waste paper. The problem of banning opium and narcotic drugs, which is of great significance to human health, is now a tool for disturbing peace in the Far East. Regarding this problem, the people of China and Japan must reflect deeply and appeal to the whole world. For the sake of human happiness, we must seek a perfect solution, then the purpose of this article will be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Paper Money Tax Resolved <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲ Tax Amount: 3.06 Million Yuan</p>
<p>▲ All Banks Have Fully Paid</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that there has been much speculation and confusion about the collection of the paper money tax. Yesterday, a reporter from the National News Agency visited the responsible personnel of the Ministry of Finance to inquire about the truth of the matter. They were kind enough to make the following statement:</p>
<p>The National Government promulgated the Paper Money Regulations on August 1, 20. The regulations stipulate that the banks issuing paper money should have 60% in cash and 40% in marketable securities as reserve funds. A portion of the securities should be taxed at 2.5%, and a portion of the cash is naturally tax-free. The total paper money tax rate is only 1% of the total amount issued. The banks in Shanghai that issue paper money firmly acknowledge that the government has the reason to collect the paper money tax. At the same time, they believe that the Japanese army's invasion of Shanghai and the floods throughout the country have led to financial stagnation and commercial depression. They generally believe that the tax rate set by the government is too high and request that the original 2.5% be reduced to 1.25%. The Ministry of Finance's opinion is that commercial conditions should be considered, and the country's finances should also be taken into account. The tax rate can be reduced in the future, but for this year, the laws and regulations that the country has promulgated must be implemented. As a result of the consultations, the banks have a long sense of patriotism and take the overall situation into account. They have paid the full tax amount of 3.06 million yuan.</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reports that Mr. Song Ziwen, acting President of the Executive Yuan, received a telegram from Chairman Chiang from Wuhan the day before yesterday, urging him to immediately accompany Minister of Transportation Chen Mingshu and General Commander of the 19th Route Army Cai Tingkai to Beijing to discuss national affairs. Mr. Song originally planned to accompany Mr. Cai to Beijing on Mr. Song's own Sikorsky aircraft yesterday morning. However, it was found that the tail rotation of the aircraft was not working properly during the test flight yesterday morning. For the sake of prudence, the pilot immediately drove the aircraft to the Longhua Airport for repairs. As of 2:00 p.m., the repairs had not been completed, so Mr. Song was unable to go to Beijing yesterday. The departure has been rescheduled for 6:00 a.m. this morning, when he will fly to Beijing with General Commander Cai. Minister of Transportation Chen Mingshu was unable to accompany him due to other commitments.</p>

<p>The new commercial treaties that our country revised with Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, France, Poland, and other countries in 17 and 18 years will expire this year after three years. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet notified the countries to revise them again. Foreigners say that they will continue to be valid for three years. However, the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty has been in effect for three years since its approval, but the French have not yet implemented it. The Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty has exceeded 30 years, and the Japanese have not allowed it to be revised. In addition, for those that have not expired, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to revise them when they expire. The following is a record of the news obtained by the reporter of the New Sound News Agency:</p>
<p>▲ Continued Validity for Three Years The new commercial treaties that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revised with Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Portugal, and Spain between November and December of the 17th year and the commercial treaties that were concluded or revised with Turkey, France, and Poland between January, May, and September of the 18th year, except for the Sino-Polish Treaty, were mutually notified and approved by the governments of both countries in the 18th year and took effect. Currently, except for the Sino-French Commercial Treaty, which expires on the 16th of next month, and the Sino-Polish Commercial Treaty, which expires in the spring of next year, the others have expired one after another this year after three years. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet notified the above countries to propose revisions. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired from the consulate that since neither party to the expired treaties has proposed revisions, the treaty will remain valid for another three years. According to international practice, treaties are mostly established with a validity period of three years. After the expiration, if neither party proposes revisions, they will continue to be valid for another three years and do not need to be notified.</p>
<p>▲ Japan Refuses to Revise The Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty was signed in the 22nd year of Guangxu and has been in effect for nearly 40 years. China has expired three times (according to the old rate set by China and foreign countries, the term is 10 years), but the Japanese side still refuses to propose revisions. The Japanese side is taking the excuse that the six-month consultation period has expired (according to the treaty, revisions should be discussed within six months, and if they are not completed, they will continue to be valid for 10 years) and requesting an extension of 10 years. Currently, the treaty has exceeded 34 years and has not been revised. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has long announced that all countries whose treaties have expired and have not been able to revise new treaties are considered to be countries without treaties and will be treated with the temporary measures announced in the 17th year.</p>
<p>▲ France Does Not Implement The Sino-French Vietnam Land Commercial Treaty and the Sino-French Beijing Supplementary Commercial Treaty. In July of the 17th year, a note was sent to the French ambassador to open negotiations. After a year, the Sino-French Beijing Supplementary Commercial Treaty was abolished on May 16, 1929, and revised and signed as the Sino-French Vietnam Land Commercial Treaty. After being approved by the governments of both countries, it took effect on September 16 of the same year. It will expire on the 16th of next month, after three years. However, the French side is delaying implementation on the pretext that the Gui Army destroyed the French Consulate in Hankou last year and the refund of import taxes in Yunnan. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained to France, the French side fully understood, but the regulations on the mutual benefit goods list between the two countries have prevented it from being realized. It is heard that the authorities are in the process of carrying it out.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Anti-War Alliance Held Two Meetings Yesterday and Declared Its Closure Last Night <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲ Appointed Ma Xiangbo and 14 Others as Honorary Committee Members</p>
<p>▲ Appointed Wu Daquan and 56 Others as Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>The Standing Committee Will Be Established Today</p>
<p>The Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance held its second and third meetings yesterday morning. It was decided to establish branches in various provinces, cities, counties, and overseas Chinese locations to recruit members and carry out the anti-civil war movement. At the afternoon meeting, 57 standing committee members, including Wu Daquan, and 15 honorary committee members, including Ma Xiangbo, were elected. The conference closed last night and issued a declaration. The first meeting of the standing committee will be held at the Bankers' Association at 3:00 p.m. today. The following is a record of the news:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Second Meeting in the Morning <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>▲ Mr. Lin's Speech The meeting was declared open at 9:00 a.m. The chairman, Wang Xiaolai, respectfully read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and performed the ceremony. Then, the chairman, Lin Kanghou, reported on the meeting of the Review Committee and the Preparatory Committee. He said that the presidium of the conference and the preparatory committee had tried their best to make everything simple and clear, so that the cessation of civil war could be effectively implemented. Some people doubt whether the alliance has any political background and whether Shanghai has been contracted to do it. In fact, the alliance is purely an organization of all sectors of society who yearn for the cessation of civil war and has no background. The original initiators were the four organizations in Shanghai, and the meeting place was in Shanghai, so it was more convenient and enthusiastic for Shanghai people to participate. However, this only shows their enthusiasm for the cessation of war. As for the implementation plan, as soon as the general association and branch organizations are established, they will be able to exert their influence and eliminate civil war. Yesterday, we received telegrams from the Honolulu Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese United Association, congratulating the opening of the alliance and joining the alliance. Then, he explained that the Yantai Beer Company donated beer and the Yick Loong Watson Company donated soda water, which were both national product merchants expressing their enthusiastic support for the cessation of civil war. Then, he reported on today's agenda and the inspection of the city's chamber of commerce boy scouts by the representatives at noon, and asked the Datong Music Society to play national music.</p>
<p>▲ Review Report Chen Liting, chairman of the Proposal Review Committee, reported on the review of the proposals and received 85 formal proposals. There were many other opinions expressed in letters and declarations. Since they were not formal proposals, they were not included. All the proposals were divided into two categories in addition to the proposals of the Preparatory Committee, which were classified as the first category. The second category was the plan within the scope of the alliance's articles of association, including 61 proposals from Liang Shiyi and others. The third category was the plan outside the scope of the alliance's articles of association, including 24 proposals. Among them, many have both characteristics and have been listed separately.</p>
<p>The Review Committee believes that all the plans in categories 2 and 3 are of great value and asks you to discuss them in detail.</p>
<p>▲ Discussion Situation After the review report, according to the agenda, the discussion of the first category of proposals began. Ye Guansheng temporarily moved that the articles of association of the alliance should be revised and passed by the representative assembly. For a time, those who seconded and those who thought it was not necessary to revise and pass all stated their reasons. After an hour of discussion, the chairman, Wu Daquan, put it to a vote. As a result, the majority agreed to submit it to the assembly for passage. Lin Kanghou then read it item by item. Except for the assumption that the number of standing committee members in Article 7 was from 50 to 100, and the addition of Article 11, the rest were passed according to the original proposal. It was already 10:45 a.m. Then, the first category and the second category of proposals were discussed and passed, and they were handed over to the standing committee for separate implementation.</p>
<p>▲ Resolutions on Various Cases A. Review Report, First Category (1) Branches should be quickly borrowed from chambers of commerce or other legal organizations in various provinces, cities, counties, and overseas Chinese locations. The articles of association will be quickly formulated and handled by the Standing Committee. (2) The General Association and branches should quickly publish in newspapers and send people to recruit members. All organizations and individuals who have joined the initiators should also be introduced to members separately. (3) According to Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Association, the General Association should quickly publish a "Cessation of Civil War" periodical on a regular basis and send it to the branch associations in various provinces and cities for distribution in the locations of the general and branch associations. Celebrities should be invited to give public speeches on "Cessation of Civil War" at any time. (4) According to Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Articles of Association, the personnel of the General Association and branches should investigate at any time whether there are political disputes in various places that may cause civil war, and report them to the Standing Committee for prevention. (5) According to the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Articles of Association, the Standing Committee should adopt the proposals of the members and study the methods of peaceful cessation when civil war occurs, and may appoint members who are familiar with the situation in various places and industries as commissioners to study separately for temporary adoption by the Standing Committee. (6) The expenses of the General Association, according to Article 8 of the Articles of Association, are planned to be raised from the organizations and individuals who join. Each organization is free to determine the annual donation of 50 yuan to 500 yuan, and each individual is free to determine the annual donation of 5 yuan to 100 yuan. If the above donations are not enough for the use of the alliance, donations may be raised from organizations or individuals outside the alliance to supplement them. After this case was discussed and passed by the assembly, it was handed over to the Standing Committee for separate handling. B. Review Report, Second Category. 61 proposals from Liang Shiyi and others were passed by the assembly and handed over to the Standing Committee for handling.</p>
<p>▲ Formation of Nomination Committee The discussion continued until 11:20 a.m. The chairman, Wu Dingchang, announced that he was afraid that there would not be enough time to continue discussing the proposals and proposed to discuss the formation of the nomination committee in advance. It was decided to elect the seven members of the presidium as ex officio members, and then the presidium would appoint 14 people to form the nomination committee. When 14 people were appointed, Yu Rongqiao, Han Yangshan, Chen Peide, Li Gongpu, Shi Leiying, Liu Jichen, Zhu Xuefan, Huang Linsheng, Chen Liting, Liu Guangpei, Xu Jiqing, Chen Zheqing, Song An, and Ye Guansheng opened the nomination committee at 1:20 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Abolishing the Warring Factions Alliance Charter <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Charter for the Abolition of the Civil War Grand Alliance: (Article 1) This conference is convened to launch a nationwide people's movement to abolish civil war because foreign aggression is rampant, stemming from internal strife, and internal excuses are rife, due to civil war. (Article 2) This Alliance's movement to abolish civil war shall proceed in the following order: (1) In peacetime, the Alliance</p>
<h2>Page 15</h2>
<p>should publish open letters or speeches, stating the evils of civil war and elucidating the benefits of peace. (2) If political disputes arise that are sufficient to cause civil war, the Alliance should advise both sides to trust any popular representative bodies (before formal national representative bodies are established, legally recognized civilian business groups can substitute) to mediate. Neither party shall absolutely resort to force to resolve the issue. (3) If, unfortunately, civil war does break out, all group members and individual members of the Alliance should unanimously refuse to cooperate and may even adopt peaceful and appropriate methods to stop it. (Article 3) This Alliance shall not engage in any other activities except for the movement to abolish civil war. (Article 4) Anyone who supports the aims of this Alliance, regardless of individual, group, gender, profession, or political party, may sign up as a member without needing an introduction and have their name publicly announced by the Alliance. (Article 5) The Alliance may establish a general affairs office in Shanghai and may establish branch offices at</p>
<p>necessary locations. (Article 6) The Alliance may establish several standing committee members, with a term of one year, to form a standing committee to deliberate and manage all affairs of the Alliance. Because of the large number of members and the vast area, it is difficult to convene a general meeting. For the sake of simple and convenient procedures, the number and selection of the first standing committee members shall be decided and publicly nominated by the initiators. From the second term onwards, the standing committee shall decide and publicly nominate them. If necessary, administrative staff may be appointed, also decided and selected by the standing committee. (Article 7) The Alliance may appoint several honorary members, nominated by the standing committee. (Article 8) The Alliance does not collect membership fees, and its funds may be raised through donations from supporting organizations and individuals, but it shall not request assistance from the central or local governments or any public institutions. (Article 9) All rules and regulations necessary for the Alliance's affairs shall be formulated by the standing committee. (Article 10) The Alliance's term of establishment is temporarily set at five years, but if no civil war occurs before the expiration of that period, and it is deemed unnecessary to continue the abolition movement, it may be dissolved early. (Article 11) This charter shall be implemented upon approval by the representative assembly and shall be amended in the same way.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Nominating Committee Meeting <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>▲ Meeting Situation: The Nominating Committee met at 1:30 PM, with the attendance of Chen Zheqing, Xu Jiluo, Chen Liting, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Yunying, Yang Meizhen, Liu Zongchen, Pu Yangshan, Lu Zhangyuan, Liu Zhanen, Chen Peide, Song An, Yu Rongqiao, Chen Shucheng, Ye Guansheng, Liu Guangpei, Lin Kanghou, Wu Daquan, Li Gongpu, and Huang Linsheng. Chen Liting served as chairman, and Yan E'sheng served as recorder. Three principles were resolved. Based on these principles, a total of fifty-seven standing committee members were proposed. The meeting adjourned at 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Principles Adopted: (1) Coverage of all provinces; (2) Inclusion of all professional groups; (3) Individuals with considerable reputation and influence in their local areas.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Afternoon Third Meeting <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chairman's Report: At 3 PM in the afternoon, the third meeting continued, chaired by Wang Xiaolai. After performing the ceremonial rites, he reported on the Nominating Committee meeting and the nomination standards. He then announced the list of fifteen honorary members and fifty-seven standing committee members (recorded separately) and explained that as the Alliance's affairs expand, the number of honorary members and standing committee members will be increased at any time, in order to generate widespread power. He requested the assembly's approval, which was passed unanimously without objection.</p>
<p>▲ Discussion Situation: Continuing the discussion of proposals, the review committee, Chen Liting, first reported that there were twenty-five proposals, which were merged into the third category. The reason being that although the content was extremely valuable, some proposals were beyond the Alliance's capabilities, such as reorganizing the army. During the discussion, some people questioned the standard of the scope of civil war. After the review committee explained, "Non-bandit suppression military actions are considered civil war and are factually determined by the standing committee." Afterwards, someone raised the question of whether the suppression of communists constitutes civil war and how the Alliance should express its opinion on it. Chairman Lin Kanghou replied that it would be referred to the standing committee to solicit public opinion and make a decision. Subsequently, it was resolved that all third-category proposals would be referred to the standing committee for consideration and implementation. Later, Huang Jinghan and fifty-three others proposed a temporary motion on how to prevent the financial sector from recognizing and raising public bonds related to civil war. The proposers requested the assembly to send a telegram to all sectors, uniformly refusing to do so. Chairman Lin Kanghou and Wang Xiaolai explained separately that there was no need to send a telegram because any military personnel raising public bonds would always use construction as a pretext and would never openly admit to using it for civil war. Qian Xinzhi said that the initiating groups are the banking and money industry groups. As he works for a bank and has now joined the Alliance, he will never lend a single penny to civil war in the future (applause from the crowd). He also hoped to absorb all staff, students, and workers of the banking and money industry into the Alliance so that its power would be strong. Chairman Lin Kanghou decided that the standing committee should widely solicit the membership of the financial industry in various places to cut off the economic sources of civil war. There were also seven temporary motions, such as actively assisting the Northeast Volunteer Army, proposed by Chen Peide, Gong Yi, and others, all of which were referred to the standing committee.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Reception and Tour Situation <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>▲ Inspection of the Boy Scouts: After serving in the January 28th battle zone, the Shanghai business community's Boy Scouts were praised by all sectors for their love of peace and dedication to service. For this Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance conference, held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the troop, at the order of the Chamber of Commerce, summoned its members yesterday (the 28th) to be inspected by the representatives. After the meeting adjourned at 11 AM, the Boy Scouts lined up and marched out. The entire contingent consisted of eighty-two people, divided into ten squads, led by a military band playing music. The representatives then inspected them, and Wu Bingchu delivered a speech, stating that among the healthy forces in China, the Boy Scouts, especially those run by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, are the most prominent. He said that it was an honor for everyone to witness their military appearance today. After the speech, Wang Xiaolai replied on behalf of the representatives, saying that the Boy Scouts of the Alliance all served on the front lines during the January 28th Shanghai Incident and maintained order at meetings of all sectors in peacetime, so they have been deeply praised by society. He hoped that everyone would assist them so that they could make further progress. Finally, Ye Chunnian, the troop leader, said that during their service in Shanghai, four members of the troop sacrificed their lives, marking a tragic chapter in the history of the Boy Scouts, but the troop would not be discouraged because of this and is still prepared to serve the country at all times.</p>
<p>▲ Luncheon Reception: The National Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, and the Money Industry Association hosted a luncheon for the representatives. Lin's representative provided the vegetables. During the meal, Wang Xiaolai stood up and gave a speech, stating that it was a great honor to gather with representatives from all over the country today. He said that everyone had traveled far and wide to Shanghai to attend the meeting to abolish civil war and seek a way out for the nation. The Chamber of Commerce and others specially prepared vegetarian meals to welcome everyone and do their best as hosts. What he hoped for in the Alliance's affairs was that in the future, the high opinions of all representatives would be combined, and everyone would work together with focused attention and single-mindedness. Then, although the Alliance is like a newborn infant today, after a period of cultivation, it will surely complete its great mission with great fanfare in the future. At the same time, we must use the spirit of peace and struggle to strive for everything and ensure that the people of the country can live and work in peace and have the same coarse food and simple meals as they have today.</p>
<p>▲ Visiting National Products: After lunch, the Shanghai Datong Music Club played five movements of the National Music at the venue. Then, Zheng Chengqing, the general director of the conference, led the representatives to visit the National Products Market and the National Products Exhibition Hall. The representatives inquired earnestly, and the staff of the exhibition hall explained in detail, which showed that the representatives from all over the country were very concerned about the development of national production in the movement to abolish civil war.</p>
<p>▲ Public Banquet Last Night: At the Hong Kong Road Bank Club last night, the Chenbao News Agency and the Xinsheng News Agency jointly hosted a banquet for the representatives of the commercial, banking, and money industries from various provinces, cities, and counties. Wu Daquan, Yong Jianqiu, Yu Xiaochuan, Pu Yangshan, and more than fifty others attended. Pan Gongzhan and Yan E'sheng hosted the event. During the banquet, the representatives all gave speeches, and the Xinsheng News Agency presented each representative with a copy of the "Japanese Trademark Compilation." The banquet ended at 10 PM. This afternoon at 7 PM, the National Federation of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce will host a banquet for the representatives of the Chambers of Commerce of various provinces, cities, and counties.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Today's Standing Committee Meeting <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Alliance is scheduled to hold a standing committee meeting this afternoon at 3 PM. A notice was issued yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance Representatives' Assembly has, in accordance with the Alliance's charter, elected you as a member of the Alliance's standing committee. The first standing committee meeting is scheduled to be held this Monday, the 29th of this month, at 3 PM at the Bank Club on the fifth floor of 4 Hong Kong Road. Important Alliance affairs will be discussed. At that time, we earnestly hope that you will attend on time. We would be very grateful."</p>
<p>▲ Closing of the Assembly: After the discussion concluded, Chairman Yang Meizhen presented the closing declaration of the assembly (recorded separately). After the entire body approved it, Chairman Liu Zhanen delivered the closing remarks (recorded separately). Then, Huang Linsheng, on behalf of all attendees of the assembly, delivered a speech thanking the four initiating groups and the preparatory staff for their hard work and hospitality, hoping that the Alliance would develop day by day, resist foreign aggression, and build a good country, and that it would be able to implement the abolition of civil war as soon as possible and dissolve early. He also hoped that all representatives and members would not forget to work hard and pay attention to the Northeast issue and promote national products. Finally, Chairman Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, saying that the representatives had come here from afar, and this was only a slight fulfillment of the host's duty, not worth thanking. From today onwards, the people have awakened. Whether the nation, people's rights, and people's livelihood can be completed and find a way out depends entirely on this as a test. He hoped that everyone would be determined to go through fire and water and wear out their heels.</p>
<p>▲ Closing Remarks: Chairman Liu Zhanen delivered the closing remarks, saying: "The conference for these two days, gathering so many representatives and members together, focusing on discussing the abolition of civil war, has a very important meaning. When the Alliance had not yet opened, some people said that there would be civil war first within the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance, but for two days, everyone has been calm and discussing everything and has been able to complete it as scheduled, which proves that the Chinese people do have a spirit of unity. On the one hand, it shows the military personnel in the country that the masters have awakened and will no longer take a laissez-faire approach. In the future, they will concentrate their national strength and develop production. On the other hand, it shows the countries of the world that the Chinese people have risen to work hard to abolish civil war and will unite to resist foreign aggression in the future. This is the most important two meanings of the Alliance. Ordinary meetings often have meetings without discussion, discussion without decision, and decision without action. Now that our meeting has been opened and the discussion has been decided, the question in the future is whether it can be implemented or not. According to the Alliance's charter, when civil war is about to break out, mediation will be carried out. If mediation is ineffective, cooperation will not be given. This is only one method. Who is ultimately responsible for implementation? It is definitely not the case that the task is completed by entrusting it to a few standing committee members. If the resolution is not to become mere words on paper, all members must sacrifice themselves and dedicate their entire bodies and minds to the Republic of China in order to fulfill the mission of the Alliance. We must also express our sincere gratitude to the four initiating groups, the National Federation of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and the Money Industry Association, as well as the preparatory committee, for their dedication to the Alliance's affairs, and to the Xinsheng News Agency and Chenbao News Agency for their various assistance to the Alliance."</p>

This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Ministry of Railways Hosts Explanation Meeting for All Sectors on Responsible Transportation <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yu Yan's Important Remarks</p>
<p>In order to clarify the doubts about the responsible transportation implemented by the Ministry of Railways starting on September 1st, the Ministry of Railways specially dispatched Yu Yan, Director of the Business Department, and Tan Yaozong, Assistant Director, to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, they hosted a public report at the Bank Association for all sectors. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Attendees: Yu Yan, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways; Tan Yaozong, Assistant Director; Chen Xinghan, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus; Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Traffic Department. The guests included representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the fresh meat industry, the silk reeling industry, the yarn industry, and other industry associations, as well as reporters from various newspapers and news agencies, totaling approximately several dozen people. They took their seats at 3:30 PM, with Director Yu serving as chairman. He respectfully read the Prime Minister's will, and then Assistant Director Tan Yaozong reported on the significance of implementing cargo transportation responsibility.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Opening Remarks: After the meeting began at 3 PM and ceremonial rites were performed, Chairman Yu Yan gave a speech, stating that the Ministry of Communications and military authorities had long established transportation regulations for railway transportation since the tenth year of the Republic, but due to the lack of responsibility for transportation, domestic goods could not circulate smoothly. Goods piled up like mountains in the production areas, and there were no goods for sale in the consumption areas. The lack of circulation of goods led to the decline of the commercial market, and the decline of the commercial market led to the stagnation of the social economy. The Ministry of Railways itself does not want to hide the fact that it is not developing. At the same time, the high transportation costs demanded by the transshipment companies also contributed to this. For example, on the Beijing-Ningbo Railway, the transportation cost for one car of 20 tons of goods from Tianjin to Ping is 140 yuan, but the same route costs 200 yuan when transshipped. Because the railway is not responsible, cargo owners have no choice but to hire boats and small carts themselves to transport their goods, which inevitably costs them more money. Now, since Minister Gu has taken office at the Ministry of Railways, in order to relieve the suffering of merchants and people, he has actively promoted responsible transportation, so that goods can flow smoothly, and the railway's own business can also rely on it for development. What could be more pleasing than achieving both at the same time? Therefore, today, I am grateful that representatives from all sectors have taken the time to attend. I would like to seize this opportunity to gather together and ask you to give your guidance to the Ministry's handling of responsible transportation.</p>
<p>▲ Assistant Director Tan's Report: After the chairman's speech, Tan Yaozong, Assistant Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, reported on the benefits of responsible transportation to cargo owners, the people, and the railway itself, stating, "Distinguished guests, Director Yu has just explained the meaning of responsible transportation, the relief it can bring to the suffering of merchants, and the importance of developing industry and commerce in great detail. Now, let me prove it with facts. What Director Yu said is real, not theoretical. It is indeed unreasonable for the railway to be irresponsible. If goods are handed over to boatmen or porters for transport to their destination and are lost midway, can they say they are not responsible? Therefore, the railway's lack of responsibility has resulted in undesirable consequences: (1) The transportation of goods with low profits and low prices is not dared by merchants due to the lack of responsibility, and neither the production area nor the consumption area benefits. The railway also has less transportation income. (2) Because the railway is not responsible, merchants choose to transport non-time-sensitive goods by other means. For example, in the thirteenth year of the Republic, grain was transported from the Northeast to Tianjin. Because the railway was not responsible, most merchants went from the Northeast to Dalian and then to Tianjin. By the seventeenth year of the Republic, the Beijing-Ningbo Railway, in order to remedy cargo transportation, specially worked with the Sidao and Shenhai railways to handle joint transportation, but the result was that the goods still went to the South Manchuria Railway. (3) The railway's transportation cannot be guaranteed, so transshipment companies take advantage of the situation to engage in profiteering, with countless malpractices, such as secretly selling cargo cars and extorting tips from porters, all adding an extra burden to cargo owners. Moreover, business is sluggish due to extortion. Now, let me tell you a precedent that will surely amaze you. The South Manchuria Railway's income per kilometer is 110,000 yuan per year, while our country's railways only earn 20,000 yuan, a difference of more than five times. The reason for this is entirely the relationship between responsibility and irresponsibility. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways is now actively promoting responsibility. On the one hand, it wants to develop the railway itself, and on the other hand, it wants to relieve the suffering of commercial transportation."</p>
<p>▲ Guests' Speeches: After Tan Yaozong finished his report, speeches were given by the guests, starting with Li Ruzhang, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and then Huo Baoshu of the Bank of Communications. The general idea was that responsible transportation is certainly well-intentioned, but the authorities should take strict precautions against the malpractice of station staff demanding bribes in small matters. Next, speeches were given by Jin Shaoqin of the Bank of China and Zhao Shuyong, representative of the press, which had much in common, saying that responsible transportation by the Ministry of Railways is certainly convenient for both the railway and cargo owners, but the transshipment industry must also be taken into consideration, otherwise the livelihood of the transshipment industry will inevitably be difficult. Finally, the chairman replied, saying that the Ministry of Railways has already instructed the staff of each road station to take precautions against the malpractice of transshipment and road bureau personnel in transportation, and although the transshipment industry will be affected, the smooth flow of cargo can lead to less profit and more transportation, and the transshipment industry will not decline because of the railway's responsible transportation. After the speech, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲ Director Yu's Talk: The reporter asked Yu Yan, who had only been in office for two months, about the many innovations in railway business that he had made, and the various aspects he had promoted, which were related to the country's century-long plan and were clearly visible to everyone. He was asked whether there would be any obstacles to promoting it in the future, and whether the national railways could be revived. As cargo transportation responsibility is the most fundamental policy of reform, the reporter raised several questions that the world may not fully understand and asked for detailed explanations. Director Yu answered as follows: (Question) Responsible transportation has been practiced in Europe and the United States for a long time, but it is still a new concept in China. Has anyone suggested it before? (Answer) The transportation conference in the eleventh year of the Republic passed a responsible transportation plan, but only a general rule was promulgated, and for ten years, except for the new railways in the Northeast, almost no railway has implemented it. (Question) Then why can it be resolutely implemented this time? (Answer) I have always been pragmatic in my work. If I can do one point, I will do it. This time, it is because the cargo transportation of each road has been declining day by day over the years, with all kinds of malpractices. Merchants have been exploited layer by layer and are suffering immensely. The future of the national economy is unthinkable. In order to complete the mission that the railway should bear, to relieve the suffering of merchants, and to develop the economy of the country and society, there is no other way but to implement responsible cargo transportation. Furthermore, in view of the repeated empty promises of responsible transportation that have not been implemented, this time I have hired experts to organize a committee to properly draft regulations, striving for perfection, so that there will be no obstacles after implementation. (Question) What are the current transportation methods and the measures of the transshipment companies? (Answer) The current malpractices are too numerous to mention. Merchants who transport goods, in addition to openly buying cargo cars, have to pay the so-called station fee. If this station fee is not paid, the station staff will deliberately create difficulties in the operation of the train, even to the point of not adding engine oil and causing the cargo cars to derail midway, and so on. A batch of goods may take months to be transported. Under this miserable situation, merchants have no choice but to pay more for transportation to the transshipment companies and ask them to send personnel to escort the goods. As a result, the transportation costs charged by the transshipment companies are several times higher than the railway's price. For example, on the Jinpu Railway, the railway transportation cost for one car of 10 tons of goods from Pukou to Xuzhou is 88 yuan, but when handled by a transshipment company, it costs 135 yuan. What crime have the merchants committed that they have to pay this extra handling fee? Merchants with weaker capital regard railway transportation as a daunting task, because the transportation costs are high, the costs are heavy, and sales are not easy. As a result, goods are congested in the place of origin and are unwilling to be transported out, and the economy of the national people is further depleted. (Question) Is there any certainty of implementing responsible transportation? (Answer) Of course there is certainty. Taking the Beijing-Ningbo Railway as an example, excluding the September 18th Incident last year, in just nine months, the income from the eleven stations that handled responsible transportation alone increased by 3.33 million. The preliminary trial run has been so effective that it can be done. If the whole country handles it uniformly, the hope for the future is truly limitless. (Question) Now that responsible transportation has been implemented, why is the freight rate increased by 10%? (Answer) The previous freight rate was set according to the transportation costs of each road and did not include the costs of responsible transportation. Now that responsible transportation has been implemented, the construction of cargo yards, the construction of warehouses, the purchase of tarpaulins, the increase of employees, the addition of cargo police, and other equipment that must be responsible, as well as compensation for losses, etc., will all be borne by the railway in the future. Therefore, the increase in costs is self-evident. (Question) How will the order of priority for transporting goods and the allocation of vehicles be handled in the future? (Answer) Goods will be transported on a first-come, first-served basis, and the allocation of vehicles will be absolutely open. If there are goods that need to be transported urgently, there are also priority and most-priority methods, but this is only a temporary measure in case the vehicles are not sufficient. In the future, when the vehicles are properly dispatched, there will be no backlog of goods in the warehouse, and they will be transported as soon as they arrive, so there will be no so-called priority and most-priority. (Question) What about the bill of lading? (Answer) The value of the bill of lading is equivalent to a valuable security. Merchants with a capital of 10,000 yuan can use it as collateral after a batch of goods is shipped and then load a second batch. Thus, the circulation is repeated, and 10,000 yuan can be used to make 30,000 to 40,000 yuan worth of transactions. This point is very important for the circulation of funds, and the railway can also help merchants make collateral. (Question) Now that responsible transportation has been implemented, it seems difficult for the railway to have a huge amount of funds to cover the compensation. (Answer) This level seems to be an over-concern. As a matter of fact, the railway will never allow merchants' goods to suffer losses. The Si-Tao Railway has an annual cargo transportation income of approximately 4 million yuan, and the average annual compensation is only over 7,000 yuan. Since the Beijing-Ningbo Railway began responsible transportation, the income for the whole year was 130 million yuan, and the compensation was only over 3,000 yuan. Therefore, the railway will strictly order its staff to work diligently, and compensation will not be a problem. (Question) Will the transshipment industry be affected in the future? (Answer) The railway absolutely has no intention of making things difficult for the transshipment companies, but it hopes that the transshipment companies will no longer wantonly exploit customers and purely adopt the principle of small profits and more transportation, so that their business will also be thriving. (Question) What if responsible transportation develops extremely rapidly and goods pile up like mountains, and the railway vehicles are insufficient? (Answer) According to current statistics, the vehicles on each road are delayed and wasted time, which is very uneconomical. The Ministry of Railways now stipulates a pattern. If cargo transportation develops, even four times more than in the past, there will be no shortage of vehicles. (Question) Are there any other obstacles after September 1st? (Answer) I ask myself, for the sake of the railway's future and to relieve the suffering of merchants, I resolutely organized it. There are absolutely no other thoughts mixed in. If anyone has high opinions, please teach me in writing at any time, and I will accept them as much as possible.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there should be no obstacles after implementation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Liaison Office of the Propaganda Committee of the General Command of the Northeast National Salvation Army received a telegram from Shanhaiguan on the 27th: (1) The troops of Jin Ziming, General Commander of the First Army of the National Salvation Army, at 9:00 AM, dismantled the railway tracks 2 li east of the Baqibao Station on the pseudo-Fengtian Railway. The Japanese army fired more than ten cannons, and more than ten of our soldiers died. Six or seven villages between Raoyanghe and Baqibao were destroyed by the Japanese army, and the loss of life and property was very heavy. Also, western Liaoning is seemingly calm, but there will be major developments within days. The Jinzhou-Chaoyang Railway is still open to Yixian, which proves that Yixian is still in the hands of the enemy. (2) The volunteer army in the Kaiyuan, Changtu, and Tieling area is gradually taking the form of a joint encirclement. Conflicts occur from time to time. The Kaiyuan station has been attacked by us twice. The Zhao Dongsheng unit under the command of Qi Ziju, commander of the Independent 16th Detachment of the National Salvation Army, fought fiercely with the Japanese army and the Wang Dianzhong puppet army in Anshan from evening to morning. A Japanese agricultural country was destroyed by us, and Japanese residents in Anshan spent a night in panic. (3) Li Ziyang, commander of the 3rd Division of the Independent 7th Detachment of the National Salvation Army, led 3,000 troops to gather near the Bingshi River on the Jilin-Changchun Railway, intending to destroy the tracks and tunnels between Xiataitai and Shimenling to cut off Jilin-Changchun transportation. The enemy and puppet forces were alerted and reinforced. Our army launched a fierce offensive.</p>

<p>Lawsuit Involving an Old Husband and a Young Concubine</p>
<p>▲Huzhou Girl Came to Shanghai to Avoid the Disaster of War</p>
<p>▲The Host's Warm Hospitality Led to Her Becoming a Concubine</p>
<p>▲Good Harmony for Eight Years Without Any Different Words</p>
<p>▲Sudden Discord Leads to a Lawsuit in Court</p>
<p>Zhu Lunqing, the owner of Yongju Money Shop in Ningbo Road, Tonghe Lane, is sixty-four years old. During the years when Qi Xieyuan and Lu Yongxiang were fighting in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, a fourteen-year-old Zhang girl from Huzhou came to Shanghai to avoid the disaster of war. Because she had some distant relationship with Zhu's concubine, Ms. Chen, she stayed at Zhu's house. Zhu saw that her face was quite beautiful, unlike a village girl, so even though the war had subsided, he insisted on keeping her. The girl also lost her parents when she was young, had few close relatives, and was alone. Returning home would leave her with no support and a difficult life. Fortunately, the host was hospitable, so she stayed with the thought of enjoying herself and forgetting her homeland. When she reached the age of fifteen or sixteen, Zhu used all kinds of teasing and paid special attention to her. Thereupon, the girl was defiled. Zhu's concubine then mediated and had Zhu take her as a concubine to avoid clandestine affairs and being laughed at by those who would catch them. The girl initially had no objection. After eight years, she had given birth to two sons and one daughter. Except for the eldest son who died young, the second son, Dahua, and the young daughter, Caifen, were all dearly loved by Zhu. Ms. Zhang was even more favored. Unexpectedly, Zhu's attitude has suddenly changed recently, and his treatment of Ms. Zhang is completely different from before, often abusing her. In the spring, he even wrote an agreement to sever the relationship, forcing her to sign it, wanting to implement a strategy of abandoning the box and keeping the pearl. However, Ms. Zhang was unwilling to sign, wanting to leave without a name, and it was difficult to live together. Therefore, she hired lawyer Jiang Yiping and filed a criminal lawsuit against Zhu in the First Special District District Court, recounting the circumstances of how she was deceived by Zhu when she was young, had a weak will, and lacked the ability to resist, and how she became Zhu's concubine after being seduced by Zhu's concubine, Ms. Chen. It was further stated that Zhu was old and confused, easily believed slander, and repeatedly abused her, making it difficult to maintain her life. However, she still lowered her head and humbled herself, hoping that he would wake up. Who knew that in March of this year, he suddenly forced her to sign a prepared agreement to sever the relationship. After begging, it was dropped. Moreover, the children born were still at the age of being cared for and raised, and the mother and children depended on each other for life and could not be separated even slightly. It was found that the defendant had committed the crime of raping a girl under the age of sixteen and abandoning a person without the ability to save herself, without providing the necessary support for her survival, which constituted a crime under Article 310, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. It was requested that Zhu Lunqing be quickly ordered to be arrested and interrogated and severely punished according to law, and that all rights to incidental civil suits be reserved in order to warn against wickedness and maintain the rule of law. The court, according to the complaint, immediately issued a summons and sent a Chinese constable No. 1281, Jin Wanrong, to Yongju Money Shop yesterday to inform the defendant to appear in court for questioning on schedule. It is said that Zhu is already an old man, while the plaintiff, Zhu Zhang, is only in her twenties. When they appear in court on another day, the pear blossoms and begonias will be even more interesting.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Two National Goods Organizations Request Speedy Arbitration of Labor-Management Disputes <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens Promoting National Goods Association and the China National Goods Maintenance Association, in view of the tense situation of labor-management disputes in national goods factories and the tendency towards extremes, which is not conducive to the future of the national goods industry, telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting them to investigate the facts and arbitrate as soon as possible. The original telegram reads: (Omitted titles) The promotion of national welfare and people's livelihood depends primarily on labor-management collaboration to develop production, resist the economic aggression of the foreign powers. Since September 18th, the social economy has suffered greatly. The Chinese goods factories have suffered tremendous losses in the Shanghai war. Due to financial constraints, they have all been forced to cut back. This is a common fact and is not desirable. Unfortunately, labor-management disputes have arisen and have been prolonged without resolution, creating a trend towards mutual destruction, making those who are determined to invest in revitalizing industry wary. Existing factories are in indescribable panic, only increasing the number of unemployed workers and leaving behind hidden worries for social security. The associations feel the danger and dare not remain silent. Therefore, they telegraphed your department and government, imploring you to consider the severity of the national crisis and the immaturity of industry, and to quickly telegraph the Shanghai authorities to promptly handle the labor-management disputes in national goods factories according to law, and earnestly investigate the facts and arbitrate as soon as possible. We await your orders with utmost urgency. Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Citizens Promoting National Goods Association: Yu Hede, Feng Shaoshan, Chen Yiting, Chen Binghui, Fang Jiange, Xu Jianruo, Zhang Dezhai; Standing Committee Members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association: Wang Jie'an, Wang Hanqiang, Wang Xingyi; Respectfully requesting your investigation and decision, (sealed).</p>
<h3 id="e140">Repercussions of the Mass Movement Committee's Telegram Reaction <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>▲The Shanghai Publishing Industry Trade Union etc.The Shanghai Publishing Industry Trade Union and other organizations issued a statement regarding the labor dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Company, stating: Yesterday, we read in the newspapers that more than 40 factories, including Yixin Toothbrush Factory, made a statement regarding a telegram declaration from the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, stating that yesterday, we read in the newspapers that regarding the labor-management dispute at the Shanghai Sanyou Industrial Company, the telegram from the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government stated that the telegram included phrases such as forcing the capitalist to resume work within a specified period of time by extraordinary means. According to Article 37 of the Provisional Constitution, people have the freedom to operate businesses. This is an absolute private right under the law. Forcing work to resume not only violates the spirit of the Provisional Constitution but also sets a bad precedent unseen in the world. China's industry is just emerging. For four or five years, the government has repeatedly issued orders and declarations to protect it. Now, the reality is the opposite, and the colleagues are even more fearful. Therefore, we dare to sincerely announce this, seeking the maintenance of public opinion and a legal and proper solution. The content of the statement obscures the facts and stubbornly quibbles, hoping to confuse the public and achieve their conspiracy to oppress workers. The Sanyou Industrial Company did not suffer significant losses in the recent Shanghai war and has no reason to suspend production. The truth of the matter has long been clarified by the central and municipal party and government agencies. However, the capitalist of the company is stubbornly cunning and uses this as an excuse to forcibly close the factory, causing more than a thousand workers to be displaced and unemployed, creating social panic. The workers of the company have repeatedly negotiated with the capitalist but have been rejected. Later, the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau mediated several times, but the capitalist firmly refused to accept, resulting in no resolution. After such delays for several months, there was no prospect of a solution. The workers of the company, seeing no hope for their livelihood, went on a hunger strike as a final plea, hoping that the capitalist would wake up and resume work quickly. However, the capitalist turned a blind eye to the fact that the workers had been on a hunger strike for several days and their lives were in danger, and did not move at all. People from all walks of life felt pity and resentment for the attitudes of both labor and capital. The Central Mass Movement Guidance Committee, also aware of the extraordinary period when the lives of the workers were in danger, issued an order to deal with the capitalist by extraordinary means. This policy, for the sake of fair treatment for both labor and capital, and for the sake of humanitarian justice, should be issued. As for the national law, it is intended to protect all the people, not just to guarantee the capitalists of the aristocratic class. The operation of the capitalist should be protected by law, but the livelihood of the workers is also protected by law. Moreover, factories are not allowed to suspend production freely. This is also clearly stated in the Constitution. These factories disregard the suffering of our workers and speak entirely from the standpoint of private interests, which further shows the viciousness of the capitalists. Moreover, they openly oppose the reasonable measures of the central authorities of the Party, which may have other intentions. The associations feel injustice at this preposterous argument and therefore make this correction, and request the central government to implement extraordinary measures to save the endangered lives of the Sanyou Company workers. Furthermore, the recent wave of labor unrest is entirely due to the illegal oppression of workers by the capitalists. Now, these factories have jointly issued a declaration, which shows a tendency to jointly oppress our workers. In the future, the status of our workers will inevitably become darker. Therefore, in order to protect the interests of our workers, it is even more necessary to unite and make a legitimate resistance. We hope that all the workers in the city will work together, and we hope that people from all walks of life will provide strong assistance, which will not only be the blessing of all the workers in the city but also the good fortune of the Party and the country. The Shanghai Publishing Industry Industrial Trade Union Reorganization Committee, the Shanghai Press Trade Union, the Shanghai First District Water and Electricity Industry Industrial Trade Union, the Seamen's Trade Union Maintenance Association, the Stevedores' Trade Union Two-Eight System Implementation Committee, the Shanghai East District Yarn Factory Trade Union Federation, the Shanghai Knitting Industry Trade Union, the Shanghai Sixth District Cigarette Industry Trade Union, the Shanghai Eighth District Cotton Spinning Industry Trade Union, the Shanghai Fifth District Loading and Unloading Trade Union, the Shanghai Fifth District Paper Industry Trade Union, the Shanghai Sixth District Lighterage Trade Union, the Shanghai Garment Industry Occupational Trade Union, the Shanghai Dongjiadu Ferry Trade Union, the Shanghai First District Knitting Industry Trade Union, the Shanghai Timber Transport Trade Union, the Shanghai Plywood Industry Industrial Trade Union, and other 27 trade unions jointly declare.</p>
<p>▲Declaration of Assistance from the Press Trade Union The Press Trade Union declared its support for the laid-off workers of the Sanyou Industrial Company, stating: It has been eight months since the Sanyou Industrial Company's labor unrest occurred, and it has not yet been resolved. It is not that the unity of our workers is not strong, but that the capitalists are deliberately trying to put the workers to death. Although the workers organized a hunger strike group to promote the capitalists' pity, the deranged capitalists turned a deaf ear and did not change their minds even slightly due to the hunger strike. Alas, how vicious! If they could wholeheartedly improve the factory's industry and develop domestic goods, so that money would not flow out, at a time when China is advocating domestic goods, Sanyou Industrial Company can be called the most developed industrial factory in China. Now, they want to put the workers to death and shut down the developing general factory. We recall that the Sanyou Industrial Company once had only a few hundred yuan in capital, and then gradually expanded to its current development. It is truly the crystallization of the sweat and blood of all the workers. The workers do their best to produce with the capitalists, and they also want the business to develop and the domestic products to be excellent. The workers are also concerned that foreign goods are increasingly flooding the market and domestic goods will be eliminated, so they strive for excellence and compete with foreign goods. Looking at the various products of Sanyou Industrial Company, compared with foreign goods, there is not much difference, and the goods produced are even better than imported goods, all created by the energy of the workers. Given these two points, now the Sanyou capitalists are repaying kindness with hatred, disregarding the livelihood of the workers, and wanting to achieve their goal of oppressing the workers. The Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Party Headquarters have repeatedly mediated but have ignored them. They want to create social unrest. During this time of internal and external troubles, even genuinely loss-making industrial factories are still maintaining the livelihoods of the workers, let alone profitable factories. Now, the central government has sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate and force the Sanyou Industrial Company to restore its former state in order to maintain the livelihoods of the workers, but the Sanyou Industrial Company has rejected the order and contacted major industrial factories in China to publish declarations in various newspapers, implementing their great capital alliance and striving to create social panic, talking about Article 37 of the Provisional Constitution, which states that people have the freedom to operate businesses and that it is an absolute private right under the law. Moreover, we are under the economic oppression of foreign powers and suffering from the tragedy of natural and man-made disasters. Maintaining the status quo is already extremely difficult. We thought the capitalists did not know the various sufferings, but it turns out they do. You also know about natural and man-made disasters, so why do you do all kinds of vicious things? The workers have already suffered from natural and man-made disasters and are now suffering from the oppression of the capitalists. In Shanghai, where the cost of living is high, they can only barely make ends meet when they have a job. Once they suffer the pain of unemployment, how tragic will it be? Where is the capitalists' conscience? Moreover, Sanyou Company has always advocated domestic goods and treated workers well, so its business has gradually developed and has truly become the leader in the country. Last year, all factories were affected by the war, but Sanyou Company's business was better than in previous years because the people were driven by patriotism and bought domestic goods from Sanyou Industrial Company, so the profits were more than 300,000 yuan. The China Industrial Federation listened to Sanyou Company's one-sided story and echoed it, earning the notoriety of oppressing workers. Under the clear sky and bright sun, how can the people willingly accept the oppression of the capitalists? The workers follow Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's teachings and still embrace the spirit of labor-capital cooperation, and do not take any excessive actions, but wait quietly for the arbitration of the party and government agencies. However, the China Industrial Federation dares to destroy Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's teachings on protecting labor organizations, creating criminals who darken society. The colleagues of our association stand on the same position as the workers, our friendship is as deep as those in the same boat, and we are ready to go to life and death together. We are willing to fight with the capitalists, rather be a broken jade than an intact tile. All my workers, rise up together and fight to the death with the capitalists who are destroying the workers! Our association will lead more than a thousand workers to provide strong assistance. We hereby declare.</p>
<p>▲Trade Union Federation etc.The Trade Union Federation's declaration regarding the declaration of various factories and companies states: Yesterday, we read in the newspapers the declarations of dozens of factories, including Shanghai Yixin Toothbrush Factory, and the telegrams from the China Industrial Federation to the Central Party Headquarters and various ministries, which caused us great surprise. The labor-management dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Company has been through the local highest party headquarters together with the government to persuade the capitalists to quickly resume work in order to avoid the expansion of the dispute, but the capitalists disregarded the intentions of the party and government agencies and repeatedly delayed, causing the dispute to spread and the conflict to intensify. The well-intentioned mediation of the party and government agencies could not be realized. The workers were on a hunger strike and their lives were in danger, so the central government issued an order for mandatory enforcement to help them in their plight. Moreover, the Factory Law clearly stipulates that the suspension of a factory must first be approved by the government. The factory did not obtain the government's approval beforehand, but suddenly suspended operations. After the dispute occurred, it further violated the orders of the party and government agencies and refused to resolve it, resorting to vicious means such as cutting off workers' food and stopping water supply to suppress the workers. Its illegal and unreasonable actions have long been despised by public opinion. Freedom of business is indeed enshrined in the Provisional Constitution, but freedom is only possible within the scope of the law. Suspension of business without notifying the government means that there is no freedom to speak of. All my workers should unanimously demand that the central government resolutely implement mandatory measures to warn against cunning and maintain social order. Moreover, the telegram from the China Industrial Federation contains the words "sacrificing the existing" and "throwing" everything away. Such obvious threats and unified walls are attacking us workers. If we workers do not seek a way to survive, then the workers will die of starvation, jump into the river and die, but cannot move the hearts of the capitalists who eat fat meat and cook thick food, and the central government's orders cannot be carried out by the group of wealthy people who own assets and live in mansions. Are we workers still human? Fellow workers, the situation is urgent, and the matter is dangerous. Rather than enduring grievances, allowing others to cut us into pieces, sell us off piecemeal, and die, why not rise up together, support the central government in implementing mandatory orders, and not stop until the goal is achieved? Let us encourage each other. We hereby declare, members of the Shanghai Trade Union Federation, the Newspaper Delivery Occupational Trade Union, the Cantonese Steamboat Wood Industry Weaving Industry Trade Union, the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Industrial Trade Union, the Ink Manufacturing Occupational Trade Union, the Municipal Tea Industry Workers Trade Union, the Municipal Cured Meat Industry Occupational Trade Union, the Municipal Leather Manufacturing Industry Industrial Trade Union, the Municipal Piano Industry Industrial Trade Union, the Municipal Third District Coal Silk Reeling Industry Industrial Trade Union, the Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Industrial Trade Union, the Municipal Civilian Shipbuilding Wood Industry Occupational Trade Union, the Fifth District Water Wood Industry Trade Union, the Municipal Card Industry Trade Union, the Municipal Lithographic Printing Industry Industrial Trade Union, the Municipal Umbrella Industry Trade Union, the Second District Pier Trade Union, the Fourth District Pier Trade Union, the Fifth District Garment Industry Trade Union, the Municipal Winery Occupational Trade Union, the Municipal Jar Repair Industry Occupational Trade Union, the Duck Slaughtering Industry Occupational Trade Union, the First District Pier Trade Union, the Municipal New Taikoo Wharf Workers Trade Union, etc., 34 trade unions jointly declare.</p>
<h3 id="e141">After the Workers of Sanyou Factory Resumed Eating <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>▲Still Hospitalized for Treatment</p>
<p>▲Talks on the Factory Fire</p>
<p>Hong Jiaben and others, the workers of the Sanyou Industrial Cooperative General Factory in Yinxiang Port who went on a hunger strike, have shown signs of improvement in their spirits since resuming eating on the evening of the 25th, but they are still hospitalized. Yesterday, the person in charge of the union gave a speech on the factory fire. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Hunger Strike Workers Still in Hospital. After thirty-one workers including Hong Jiaben voluntarily went on a hunger strike, Party and government agencies repeatedly sent personnel to persuade them to eat, but to no avail. Subsequently, the Party and government agencies issued a joint notice from the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the municipal government had decided to formally arbitrate the case on the 31st, and a solution was not far off, urging them to resume eating to avoid accidents. The workers complied and announced their resumption of eating that evening. Yesterday morning, the 7th District Cotton Weaving Industry Union sent two directors, Gong Yuting and Bao Boyi, to the Labor Hospital and Shanghai Hospital to visit and express their condolences. They saw that the workers' spirits had reached a good state, but many suffered from headaches and foot pain, and had not yet fully recovered. Therefore, they are still hospitalized for treatment. ▲Labor Committee Speaks on Factory Fire. The Standing Director of the 7th District Cotton Weaving Industry Union gave a speech on the factory fire that occurred the day before yesterday (the 27th), saying, "When the factory fire occurred the other day, the workers discovered it and immediately requested to enter the first half to inspect whether the fire started inside the factory. Unexpectedly, they were stopped by the police force. The reason for this is difficult to understand. After negotiations, they were allowed to enter and put out the fire. At this time, the Yangshupu Fire Brigade also drove to the scene, and the fire was extinguished in about twenty minutes. After much investigation, no leads were found. Since the workers entered the factory on June 2nd, until the police brigade stationed on the 21st of this month, strict precautions were taken, and no disasters occurred. Later, with the police brigade stationed in the factory for protection, there was no concern for accidents. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 17th, a fire suddenly broke out in the factory buildings along Ma Yushan Road, and now there is another fire alarm in broad daylight. At a time when this dispute has not been resolved, such an unfortunate event has occurred. It is clear that villains are sabotaging from within, trying to harm the workers. Therefore, in order to clarify the truth, this union must ask the Party and government agencies to thoroughly investigate."</p>
<h3 id="e142">British Public Bus Strike News Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The strike at the British Public Bus Company has been going on for twenty days and has not yet been resolved. The detained workers have not yet been released. The strike committee has hired pro bono lawyers to prepare for court defense. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Strike Committee Statement. The strike committee, fearing misunderstandings from the outside world due to recent incidents of vehicle damage, injuries, and other unfortunate events, issued a statement yesterday saying, "Workers have endured a painful strike due to the devastation and oppression of imperialist capitalists. The company has intensified its efforts to forcibly resume operations, making it impossible for workers to maintain their livelihoods. This committee will abide by the wishes of all workers, maintain order, and await mediation from Party and government agencies and legal entities. This committee has not been involved in the recent disturbances outside. We fear misunderstandings from the outside world, so we hereby declare."</p>
<p>▲Hiring Lawyers. Ticket sellers No. 199 and No. 124 were arrested by the police and interrogated by the court. They are still detained. The workers are outraged and have decided to go to court to petition for their release when the trial begins. They have also hired lawyer Li Aokui to defend them in court.</p>
<p>▲Petition Today. All the workers decided at a meeting the day before yesterday to petition the municipal government yesterday. Therefore, all the workers planned to depart yesterday. However, because yesterday was Sunday, a regular holiday for the municipal government, they decided to change it to this morning to petition and request a prompt mediation to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲New Workers and Security. Since the outbreak of the strike, the company has hired more than one hundred new workers to maintain operations and assigned them to various vehicles. Recently, due to disturbances, many new workers have been injured. Yesterday, the company issued each new worker a police whistle for security purposes, in case of need.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Anhui Merchants' Association Joint Meeting <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>▲Opposing Provincial Debt, No Personal Grudges</p>
<p>The Anhui Merchants' Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the association's headquarters yesterday (the 28th) at 3:00 PM. More than twenty people, including executive committee members Zhang Yihe and supervisory committee member Zhu Xinzai, attended. Zhang Yihe chaired the meeting. The agenda included: (1) Executive and supervisory committee member Wang Yiping proposed that the association has repeatedly strived against the case of Ye Yuanlong, a member of the Anhui Provincial Committee, privately raising debts, but to no avail. Unexpectedly, recently, one or two unscrupulous people have spread rumors, saying that "it is close to attacking a private person," in an attempt to confuse the public. How should we respond to this case? "It was resolved that the association's opposition to the private raising of provincial debt has been expressed in repeated telegrams to the provincial government, all focusing on the provincial debt itself and never involving Ye Yuanlong's personal morality. The association only asks about the facts of the private raising of provincial debt and will fight for every penny. There are absolutely no personal grudges against any individual. It was decided to appoint Chen Jiakui, Wang Yiping, and Huang Dawen to draft a declaration to publicize the association's purpose and prevent treacherous people from flattering officials and confusing right and wrong. It should be submitted to the standing committee for publication within a limited time. (2) Regarding the case of private school provincial debt, personnel will be sent to the banking industry to investigate the truth. (3) Regarding the issue of relocating the association's headquarters, it was "resolved" to appoint three members of the planning committee. After finding a suitable address, it will be submitted to the executive committee for approval.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Reward for the Arrest of the Main Culprit in the Arson of the Updated Stage <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau issued a notice yesterday, which reads, "Notice of Reward: According to a report submitted by merchant Gu Zhuxuan and others, Zhuxuan, in order to revitalize the market after the Japanese invasion of Zhabei, entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the Updated Stage at No. 6 Menggu Road and took over the operation of the Updated Stage, spending a lot of money on repairs and decorations. Now that the work is about to be completed, on the morning of August 17th at about 3:00 AM, it was suddenly set on fire by lawless bandits and almost completely destroyed. We have already submitted a detailed report requesting your approval for the arrest. Zhuxuan and the owner of the building have jointly raised 5,000 yuan each, totaling 10,000 yuan, and deposited it in Zhejiang Bank as a reward for the personnel involved in purchasing leads and making arrests. It is assumed that the mastermind and the arsonists burned this public entertainment stage to revitalize the market. Their intentions must be to harm society and disrupt order. It is definitely not a simple act against an entertainment stage that has no grievances with anyone. Their other intentions and the organization of the bandits are obvious. If we do not promptly publish a reward notice for their arrest and conduct strict investigations, it will not be enough to maintain local peace. Therefore, arson is a matter that requires strict arrest and punishment. In addition to issuing orders to all subordinates to investigate and arrest, we hereby issue a notice to inform the public. If the main culprit is found, a reward of 10,000 yuan will be given as an encouragement. This is hereby announced."</p>

<p>▲Brick and Ash Industry. The Shanghai Brick and Ash Industry Association previously convened a general meeting, but it was adjourned due to the failure to review the closure and relocation of members from the war zone.

The Bean and Rice Industry Association convened a special meeting of all members from the north and south the day before yesterday at 2:00 PM. More than 200 people attended the meeting. The meeting was called to order at 3:00 PM. Chairman Gu Xin reported the purpose of the meeting and said that today's invitation to industry meetings is because of the Yangmi that the industry has made with Dahongheng and Xiangmao Foreign Company, and is about to ship the goods. Xiangmao Foreign Company suddenly published an advertisement in the newspaper, falsely accusing Dahongheng of ceasing business, and filed a lawsuit with the court for seizure. Checking this transaction, the number is very small. According to the current market valuation, the number is only one thousand four hundred taels, but this matter is related to the harm to the industry. Please attend the industry and quickly seek countermeasures. Industry sentiment is excited, and Xiangmao Foreign Company should not falsely accuse Dahongheng of ceasing business, publish it to destroy the reputation, and sue the court to close it. If it is not negotiated, the industry will trade with the foreign company in the future, and the accusations and lawsuits will not only damage the business, but also the reputation and credit of the industry will be lost. After public discussion, the industry has agreed that those who have goods fixed by Xiangmao Foreign Company will stop the shipment and stop new transactions. Do not trade with them until it is resolved. Help Dahongheng and ask lawyer Qu Yue to file a counterclaim. It was further discussed that the railway freight car is responsible for transportation. Now the Ministry of Railways has scheduled a meeting of various commercial groups in the Bank Association Building tomorrow. Our industry should elect representatives to attend the meeting and publicly nominate Chen Ziyi as a representative to attend the meeting and discuss it. Secondly, it was discussed that the goods traded by the industry with foreign merchants, the certificate should be in Chinese as proof. If the Western certificates issued by foreign merchants are not accepted, the meeting will be adjourned at 6 o'clock.</p>

The most encouraging was that of Yongjiang, president of the Human Affairs Daily. His words were as follows: "I am very happy and gratified to be able to participate in your association's 19th anniversary celebration and the inauguration ceremony of the new committee members. In the past, when I was studying at a military school, I heard Tong Bao talk about how China's national destiny today has reached a state of decline and is in danger, and there is a danger of subjugation. Fortunately, the people in the southwestern provinces are strong and organized, so there is still hope. At first, I thought that his words were inevitably biased and arbitrary. Later, after observing the overall situation, I realized that his words were not false, and today I am even more impressed by your association's visit. I also feel that his comments contain the ultimate truth. Since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, my 19th Route Army rose up and fought, and its glory shook the world. Today is the 19th anniversary of your association. I would like to use these auspicious (19) two characters to congratulate your association on its future development and to wish it an unparalleled glory." Then, the Hewannian Music Class played music to celebrate. The Heyi Sports Association Lion Dance Troupe, the Qunxiong Sports Association Lion Dance Troupe, the Qunzhi Sports Association Nine Lion Troupe, and the Gaoyang Temple Workers Lion Dance Troupe, with the sound of drums and firecrackers, shook the sky. They successively lined up and went to the meeting to pay their respects.

The firecrackers outside the door went off again, like a string of beads, and the streets were crowded with people, making it impossible to move. It can be said that it was extremely grand.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Abolition and Prevention <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The meaning of the two characters "abolition" is to abolish and stop. However, it does not make clear whether it is self-abolition or abolition by others. But the meaning of the two characters "prevention" is different, meaning that there is mandatory enforcement. Even if the authorities are unwilling to stop, one still wants to enforce it strongly. Therefore, the meanings of the two characters "abolition" and "prevention" are quite different.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Great League for the Abolition of Civil War was held in Shanghai, with 449 representatives from various provinces and cities. It can be said to be an unprecedented grand gathering. One member proposed that the two characters "abolition" should be changed to "prevention", which is indeed more meaningful. Because calling for peace and stopping civil war has been going on for many times in the past 20 years. However, the warlords, while signing peace agreements, still opened the door wide and fought their battles. What is the meaning of such appeals? What is the effect of such agreements?</p>
<p>Therefore, a member advocated that the two characters "abolition" should be changed to "prevention", to change from a request-style to a mandatory-style. This is indeed very valuable. However, the guns are in their hands. What methods do you have to prevent it? How much ability do you have to prevent it? As in the proposal, there are also methods to prevent civil war. The general method is non-cooperation. May I ask, in previous civil wars, which one was cooperated and approved by the people? It can be seen that the effectiveness of the proposed method is also equal to zero.</p>
<p>However, the definition of the so-called "civil war" is even more difficult to say. For example, the suppression of the Communists, is it a civil war, or is it not a civil war? If it is a civil war, then should the Communists be allowed to move around everywhere? If it is not a civil war, then it is actually in the form of a civil war. Moreover, on the one hand, imperialists shout loudly and implement their annexation policies, while on the other hand, communists harass everywhere. Even if we want to resist foreign aggression, we cannot unite our forces. We will inevitably find excuses. Therefore, the Communist Party should also change its policy at this time and shout the slogan of uniting against foreign aggression.</p>
<p>To put it more thoroughly, this is not the time to shout for the abolition of civil war. It is the time to shout for unity and joint resistance to foreign aggression. If we only talk about the abolition of civil war, like the northern generals' advocacy of non-resistance, in a few days, they completely presented the 30 million people and tens of millions of square miles of land outside the customs. At that time, there was no so-called civil war in the north. In this way, although there is no civil war, it is no different from civil war. Therefore, what should be discussed now is how to thoroughly resist foreign aggression and how to recover lost territories, which is the best strategy.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Method of Manufacturing Agar-agar <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Slave</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have once again chanted the slogan of boycotting enemy goods and breaking off economic relations, because the scars suffered this time are relatively deep, so its temporality will not be five minutes. "Remembering the past is a guide for the future." Since we know that the previous boycotts were temporary and passive, and often wasted a lot of precious energy after the event, without getting any price, we should now take a further step and make a permanent and active boycott, that is, for enemy goods that our country does not have substitutes for, study how to make them, and actively hurry up to make them. Compared with a monotonous passive boycott, the effect is more than ten times greater. Now, I will briefly write down the method of manufacturing agar-agar in enemy goods below.</p>
<p>In July and August, go to the coastal areas of our country to collect fresh Gracilaria (available in dried seafood stores), wash it with fresh water, soak it for three or four days, take it out and dry it in the sun. After drying, use ten catties of Gracilaria, soak it in a solution of nine taels of bleaching powder, two qian of sulfuric acid, and six sheng of clear water (this solution should be filtered first). After about ten minutes, when the vegetable turns white, take it out and soak it in lime milk. In less than three minutes, wash it in clear water, mash it with a stone pestle, and then bleach it with clear water to remove any other odors from the raw material, then put it in a pot, add five times the amount of water, and boil it. Add a little rice vinegar and stir gently while boiling. After about half an hour, change to a slow fire, and when the vegetable is completely dissolved, remove the fire, squeeze the juice with a cloth, put the obtained liquid juice back into the pot and boil it to reduce the water content. When it turns into a paste, pour it into a tree plate and wait for it to solidify (the temperature should be high at this time, otherwise it will not easily solidify). Then cut it into paste strips about one foot long and two inches wide with a knife, and then cut the thick strips into thin strips with a dividing machine, dry them in the sun, and they will become white agar-agar like silver threads.</p>
<p>Editor's note, I think agar-agar is widely used in our country, and it can indeed be manufactured according to this method. However, when it is about to solidify, do not cut it with a knife, but filter it out using the method of making vermicelli, or squeeze it out using a noodle-making machine. I wonder if it is possible? I respectfully ask Mr. Nu for his opinion.</p>

<h3 id="e159">My Opinion on Improving Bathhouses <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Here, what I am talking about is not the exquisite bathrooms in high-rise buildings, but the bathhouses in the streets and alleys that are exclusively for the use of ordinary citizens. Let's start by saying a few words about the existing ones.</p>
<p>(1) Everyone knows that bathing has a great relationship with health. It can be said that if someone never bathes in their life, then they will have a reduced lifespan, or at least have a weakened body. This is because regular bathing can make the pores comfortable, so that the dirt in the body can be fully discharged. Therefore, bathing is an indispensable part of life for anyone, and it is by no means limited to a certain group of people. However, most poor people not only do not have complete bathing facilities, but also cannot afford to spend a few cents to go to a bathhouse once. Of course, some people cannot take a comfortable bath even once in the entire hot season, let alone in winter.</p>
<p>(2) As long as you have been to a bathhouse once, you will definitely feel that the water in the so-called "pool" is too unclean. A pool of hot water dyed grayish-white with body dirt is full of scabies patients. People with syphilis are scratching frantically. (As for the so-called private rooms, elegant seats, and special elegant seats, etc., of course, they are not within the scope of this article.) So spending a lot of money is just buying skin diseases back.</p>
<p>(3) In such a large Shanghai, there are only a few bathhouses. So if you are determined to take a bath, you have to spend a lot of tram fare. At the same time, because the fees for bathhouses are too high, each time costs at least five cents or more.</p>
<p>(4) It seems that it has been generally recognized that women do not need to bathe: otherwise, why are there so few bathhouses for women in this undeveloped Shanghai? I have limited knowledge and I am not a woman, so I only know that there are a few on Fourth Malu that seem to be opened for prostitutes (I have to repeat again, Turkish baths, bathing in hotels, ... are not within the scope of this article.)</p>
<p>(5) ... Of course there are more, but I can't remember them all at once.)</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, I have the following opinions on bathhouses.</p>
<p>(1) Opening bathhouses is one of the main social undertakings, that is, to enable everyone to have the opportunity to bathe often. And to make the habit of bathing universal to every citizen.</p>
<p>(2) All bathhouses should use pools, which should not be too large, so that water can be changed constantly, and at the same time, it will not consume too much hot water. Everyone can only use soap to wash themselves as clean as possible outside the pool, and use a basin to scoop water to wash themselves clean, and then immerse themselves in the pool, so that the pool water will not be easily contaminated.</p>
<p>(3) People with skin diseases are absolutely prohibited from entering, so as to avoid infection.</p>
<p>(4) Bathhouses should not charge too high fees, at most one cent. And crack down on all extra expenses. Because bathhouses do not need to be overly extravagant, just one stove, one pool, and one sitting room can do the trick, which can greatly save capital: even if the income is small, it can be supported. What's more, gradually develop the habit of people bathing every day, and at the same time, people have the economic possibility of bathing every day: of course, there will be many customers, and business will naturally be booming.</p>
<p>(5) Women's bathhouses can be incorporated into general bathhouses, just set up another room, so that women can have equal enjoyment. (At the same time, children can also be treated equally)</p>
<p>(6) Bathhouses must be common, even one bathhouse on average for every hundred households. On a grander scale, it should be common in rural areas and common throughout the country.</p>
<p>(7) There's more, there's more.</p>
<p>Of course, the above methods, if it is a peaceful and prosperous age, the government has a major responsibility to promote it. However, now... alas!</p>
<p>This opinion is based on the facilities in Japan (even at this time of "national crisis", I hope that I will not be given the title of "pro-Japanese"?). Enthusiastic gentlemen, please visit the Japanese bathhouses in Hongkou.</p>
<p>This humble sincerity is respectfully presented to you, and I hope that you will teach me something.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to say: "Only with healthy citizens can there be a healthy country." Bathing can help promote health, which is of course cultivating the country's strength. I have added a few words to supplement the lack of the aforementioned reasons.</p>
<p>Sadness</p>
<h3 id="e160">Father and Son <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Now it's raining heavily again. I've closed all the windows around me. I'm heavily smoking a cigarette. I'm quietly listening to the sound of thunder and rain. I'm waiting for the lightning to flash in front of me again and again.</p>
<p>So my mood is both troubled and peaceful, so I recall a story from nine years ago.</p>
<p>It was also a rainy day like this. At that time, my friend Wang and I were closed in the house, letting the rain and wind blow outside the window. But Wang told me about his childhood. 丨The following is his narration.</p>
<p>"You know, the most miserable child is the one who loses his mother in childhood. This may not be something that everyone has experienced, but I have deeply tasted this kind of suffering.</p>
<p>I grew up in a poor peasant family. Of course, in such a simple family of a poor peasant, the death of my mother was undoubtedly a major blow to my father. Poor father had to get me up early, cook breakfast for himself, and then teach me to carry lunch with him to the fields. He told me stories while working. When he was tired, he taught me to sleep under the shade of a tree, letting ants and flies play on me. When the north wind blew, I had to curl up in my clothes and cry. The morning was like this, and so was after lunch. Until dusk, I rode home on the back of a cow.</p>
<p>My parents loved each other very much. This can be seen from my father's narration. I am my mother's only son, and also my father's only son. It is precisely because of my mother's death that I feel the greatness of my father's benevolence. I can get full proof of this.</p>
<p>Once, I was beaten and bled by the child next door. Of course, I had to endure it, because I always wanted to find an opportunity to retaliate once. One evening, I actually found this opportunity. I beat his nose until it bled the same way, so I won. But soon the child cried and led his mother to my house. At that time, my father was washing his feet. I only heard the woman pointing at my father and saying:</p>
<p>"Your child is too hateful. You must teach him a lesson. Look, he beat my child until he bled."</p>
<p>"Dad!" I snatched and retorted: "He beat me and bled last time, but I didn't tell you like him."</p>
<p>So my father comforted the child's mother, apologized carefully, and shouted at me, I cried. So the child walked away triumphantly. But I was insulted, I was very sad. Soon I watched my father turn his face and say to me in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Child, I didn't beat you, why are you still crying? You have to know that you shouldn't quarrel with them, you can only suffer, because you are a child without a mother!"</p>
<p>So my father also sobbed.</p>
<p>But he didn't spoil me that much.</p>
<p>Once, I ran back from a private school, and tried my best to cover it up in front of my father. Father didn't say a word, I felt very relieved. At dinner, he especially reminded me and said:</p>
<p>"You eat more rice tonight."</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked:</p>
<p>"For no reason."</p>
<p>After dinner, my father sat in the lawn. As usual, I approached him, but he grabbed me with one hand, and picked up his shoe and hit me on the back, shouting:</p>
<p>"Will you skip school next time?"</p>
<p>"Dad!" I cried: "No, I dare not anymore."</p>
<p>This lesson was very effective for me, and since then I have developed the habit of studying hard. Perhaps this kind of internal punishment was my father's best teaching method."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang stopped talking. But he was still silent in his memories. After that, I asked him and said:</p>
<p>"Then you finally didn't have a stepmother?"</p>
<p>"This may be for my sake."</p>

<p>▲Effective Remedy for Curing Erysipelas. I once suffered from this disease. Although I was treated by famous Chinese and Western doctors, it was ultimately ineffective. Later, I was introduced to an effective remedy by my friend Wei Ronghui. It is very simple. The disease was cured in a few days. It has been two years since then, and it has never recurred. Out of gratitude, I am spreading it widely so that those who suffer from the same disease can be cured. Raw oil (i.e., peanut oil) should be applied with cotton about five or six times a day. Raw oil should be purchased from ordinary sauce gardens. Patients should avoid washing with hot water and must use warm water. Remember this.</p>
