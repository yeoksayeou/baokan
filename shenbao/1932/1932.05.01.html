<p>時評</p>
<h3>悲壯的五月彬</h3>
<p>五月到了。今天便是五月的開頭。五月是悲壯的。偉大的。是可泣可歌的。在歷史的篇幅上。五月間是充滿了光榮和勝利。同時也充滿了悲痛和羞辱。</p>
<p>我們試一翻過去歷史的篇幅。　　今天——五月一日。即是全世界勞働者最値得紀念的勞働節。勞働節的起源。是一八八四年十月七日八大勞工聯合會在美國芝加歌開會决議以每年五月一日爲期。舉行要求八小時工作制的運動。並指定一八八六年五月一日爲第一次示威運動的日期。從此以後。「五一」便成爲全世界工人的一個紀念日便成爲一個光榮偉大的革命紀念日。</p>
<p>今日後兩日便是「五三。」五三是一個什麽紀念。我們應該還不曾忘却罷。一九二八年。日本爲阻撓我國革命運動之進展兩次出兵山東。造成五三慘案。至今濟南城頭。血跡猶新。彈痕宛在。這深重的恥辱。深重的鞭痕。應該尙未在我們的心版上揩拭罄盡罷。</p>
<p>再後一日。便是有名的「五四」。五四運動之爆發。是在民國四年。其爆發的近因。爲由於日本二十一條之脅迫。與軍閥政府賣國行爲之刺激。而其意義則爲一次反帝國主義反軍閥之民主運動。亦即爲劃時代之新文化運動五四運動發生而後。我國的文化。乃顯然轉入一個新的方向。</p>
<p>再次是「五九」。五九是我民族歷史上最沉痛的一頁。在民國四年的這一天。由於日本以哀的美敦書作最後的脅迫。夢想復活帝制死灰的北洋軍閥袁世凱。便不顧民意。於是日與日本簽訂最可恥可痛的二十一條。這二十一條内容極苛刻。不僅是足以亡我國。抑且足以滅我種。然而袁政府根本不顧民族的利益。不惜賣國以自利。於此足以證明帝國主義與軍閥爲互相依庇。我們今後而欲求我民族之自由平等。必須根本打倒軍閥。</p>
<p>本月的最後一天爲「五卅」。血染的「五卅」。大家也許還未曾忘却罷。雖說南京路上的塵土。已將民國十四年的血跡輕輕地淹没。然而這一次的慘案。却留下了永永不可磨滅的歷史。</p>
<p>我們翻閱了過去偉大而又羞辱的舊賬之後。究作何感想呢。而且當前我國家正陷於危急存亡的「艱境」中。在此艱難情勢之下。度過這悲壯的五月。我們更將作何感想呢。未來的五月。正等待著我們創造新的光榮與偉大啊。</p>

<p>路透社三十日東京電云、此間日報對於虹口公園炸彈案、均表驚訝、且謂上海休戰恊定之簽訂勢必延緩、殊可悵惜、衆料此驚人之事件、將不致波及中日間關係、肇事地點旣在日方勢力範圍之内、且兇犯復係日本臣民、日當局自無向中國抗議之意、各報對此事件之論調、頗稱穩健、蓋案中行兇者之目的、此時尙未明瞭也、</p>

<h3>西報紀載各情</h3>
<p>譯大陸報　大陸報云、昨日虹口公園發生炸彈案後、工部局公共工程處美人希巴特亦遭拘留兩小時、希氏寓居江灣路四十一號、即在公園附近、因見日兵追捕工程處兩華工、出而緩頰、遂同遭拘捕、據稱兩華工係在園中工作、迨炸彈發生後、見有日兵前來作逮捕狀、華工急奔避、日兵乃追之至哈氏寓所、事後、美總領事署得報、遂向日當道交涉、要求釋出希氏、如果有犯罪嫌疑、請即移交美當道審理、否則立予釋放、於是日當道召希氏問話後、遂予釋放云、</p>
<p>大美晚報　大美晚報云、昨晨虹口公園之炸彈案、共傷十一人、日本居留民團行政委員長河端已於今晨四時前、在福民醫院因傷重逝世、日使重光葵今日午後狀仍危殆、據福民醫院中人聲稱、該使身中炸彈碎片二十餘、聞澈夜呻吟、甚覺痛若、醫士一面爲其止痛、一面施用手術、爲其移去深陷腹部、與下肢之金屬碎片、其餘受傷者、今日已確有轉機、野村司令頭部受重創、右目不保、）據大陸報云、左眼珠已取出、）惟體况尙好、白川司令身中數創、最重處乃在顎部、植田司令足受重創、或須截去數足趾、村井領事今日大有進步、如傷無意外變化、則休養兩星期、或可到署辦公、居留民團書記長友野、臂雖受創、並不厲害、其他受微傷者、有日兵兩名、日水手一名、大阪每日新聞攝影師一人、今晨據日總領事署消息、日軍民當局對於炸彈案、已開始作初步查究、現信出事後、即有數人因株連被拘、昨日午後與夜間、復拘獲嫌疑者數人、昨晨出事後被拘之人、經盤問後、多經開釋、現在拘禁中者、尙有幾人、未能確悉、但今晨聞共爲八人、三爲韓人、現信餘皆華人、擲炸彈之韓人尹奉吉被拘後、曾遭日人痛毆、遍體鱗傷、後經日憲兵及日商團救出、法捕房昨夜曾應日當局之請、至少在界内拘獲韓人一名、此外凡被疑從事排日活動之韓、現正在日人緝捕中、今晨當局不欲聲明此案是否一人　一小團體所爲、抑爲偉大暗殺陰謀之一部分查死者河端、爲日居留民中最老最有聲望者之、於俄日戰爭前由大阪來滬業醫、數年前被舉爲日居留民團副委員長、兩年前被舉爲正委員長、有老母旅滬、弟妹在大阪、工部局總辦鍾思、今晨曾代表該局致函日居留民團弔唁河端之遇害、工部局總董培而、今晨亦致函日領事井口慰問昨日受傷諸人　並希望其早日痊愈、</p>
<h3>法租界韓僑危</h3>
<p>搜李春山　自是案發生、韓人尹奉吉當塲被捕後、立經日憲兵司令部詳密研訊、關於兇手供詞、日方嚴守秘密、而訊問結果、認爲現住法租界之韓國僑民團總裁李春山有重大嫌疑、遂於當日下午一時、日總領事署即特派便衣警探多名、持文逕赴法捕房嚴厲要求、將李拘捕並引渡、法捕房即派刑事隊同往霞飛路寳康里二十七號李之住宅搜捕、時李適不在家、旋經日警一度嚴密查抄、終無所獲、</p>
<p>捕安昌浩　當時捕李未獲、即</p>
<p>留少數日警在李宅駐守、未幾、忽來一五十餘歲之韓人、至李宅訪李、詎甫入門、即遭日警逮捕、當時疑其人即係李春山、立即帶入盧家灣法總巡捕房、經捕頭詳問一過、不料斯人並非李春山、而爲韓國革命領袖安昌浩氏、於是日人更加重視、要求引渡、當時雖經安竭力剖白、及有力韓僑援救、但安氏終不能得政治犯之保障、卒被引渡至日使館、</p>
<p>安氏略歷　按安氏爲韓國革命導師、原籍朝鮮平壤、現年五十三歲、祖業務農、天性穎慧、弱冠時即從事革命運動、韓人最有勢力之「新民會」、即安氏所手剏、最初密集全韓各地青年、約近萬人、圖謀恢復國權、不料功敗埀成、亡命海外、一度赴美、復與僑美韓人組織革命團體、「三一」運動發生時、由美到滬、主持獨立運動、凡各地韓人從事革命運動者、均受安氏指揮、奮鬥迄今、埀四十餘年、曾任韓國獨立政府總理、其一生革命歷史、與卓絕精神、與我國孫總理如出一轍、</p>
<p>株連韓僑　自安氏遭捕後、居留法租界區域内之韓僑、大起恐慌、均呈不安之象、詎至昨晨二時半、日使館果派出便衣警探數十人、共分十二卡車、直驅法捕房、要求急往各處繼續搜捕韓僑、法捕房允之、並飭派探捕多人、會同前往搜索、至黎明四時許、計在白萊尼蒙馬浪路新民邨四四六號惠生醫院獲一人、爲韓人金姓、又辣斐德路三八八號獲兩人、一爲樸濟建、年二十二歲、現在英美電車公司充七十九號查票、一係樸之胞弟、年僅十七歲、現在民國路浸會堂讀書、</p>
<p>捕十七人　除以上兩處外、又在霞飛路寳康里六十五號獲四人、姓氏未詳、馬浪路普慶里八號獲一人、名張全瑾、年二十八歲、當被捕時、態度甚爲從容、並怡然語人、略謂事已至此、毫不介懷、自問此身可以對全韓同胞、可以對祖國、餘復何求云云、此後又在大埔橋新新里及各處逮捕多人、迄昨晚止、陸續共捕十七名之多、齊解日軍司令部聽候訊問、查旅滬韓僑居留法租界者數約萬人、自此事發生後、僉認爲完全失其保障、大有人人自危之概、</p>
<h3>停戰協定簽字代表問題</h3>
<p>日方由村井總領事代表</p>
<p>停戰協定、自日前非正式會議、通過英公使藍溥森關於日軍完全撤退期限之折衷辦法後、實際上已告完成、近頃日本軍政要人、在虹口公園被炸後、停戰會議、恐因日方代表受傷、或致發生影響、昨經中日英外交當局一度接洽、决定不因該事件而再陷停頓、</p>
<p>日方簽字代表　惟日方代表如植田師團長及重光公使、均已炸傷、一時不能離開醫院、簽字或成問題、茲聞日使館昨晨接得東京外務省訓令、擬以村井總領事任簽字代表、蓋以村井受傷最輕、不日即可痊愈也、日使館方面、因即通知英使、轉逹我方微求同意、外交次長郭泰祺、遂於昨晨十一時、赴英總領事館、訪晤英藍使、接洽此事、郭次長並於昨晚、將日方簽字代表問題、特電南京行政院長汪精衛請示另據日人方面消息、村井總領事傷勢雖輕、惟須兩星期方能出院、日外相芳澤、已另委日使館參事官矢野爲簽字代表、日使館參事官之地位、　一等書記官及總領事爲高、矢野現在北平、日政府已電促其來滬矣、</p>
<p>協定簽字日期　日内瓦方面、聞已於昨日舉行國聯議會特别委員會公開會議、故此間停戰恊定、祇待定期簽字、外人方面消息、恊定定明日簽字、惟尙未經官方證實、外交界方面、祇謂下星期四内可望簽字、</p>

<p>國民社二十九日日内瓦電今夜此間發表、軍縮大會之總委員會非俟各大國間對於某種政治問題商得若干切實同意後、不再開會、此項消息係在法代表彭古與法報代表談片中發表、但彭氏仍聲稱、專門委員會並不休會、又軍縮大會主席漢德森於今日主幹委員會秘密會議之後、亦發同様聲明、宣稱、總委員會暫不復開會、但除此一端外、其他仍照常進行、毫無變更、並稱、軍縮會議完全休會之動議、尙未有人提出云云、但據確訊、軍縮會議完全休會一層、會中主幹人物業已密加考慮、開史汀生與麥唐納均贊成此舉、因認苟於政治問題尙未有同意之希望時、技術方面之討論亦屬徒勞無益、而此外各方面今夜亦均承認軍縮會議因各大國政治家對於政治問題未能商得同意、業已擱淺、至各大國之所以未能商得同意者、則由於泰狄歐不願來日内瓦、將法德所爭者聽英美公斷故也、設非漢德森竭力反對休會、則軍縮會議或者今日則將閉幕、然照日前情形、料該會之完全休會、亦不過時日問題而已、至該會今後之能否化險爲夷、全繫於五大國談話之重開、據英方意見、法政府曾表示願於五月十五以後賡續日内瓦談話、而法代表彭古談片中、亦有五大國代表談話在五月十二日以前、未必重開之表示、果爾、則料軍縮會議勢須展至六月初、始有重行集議之望、現有一端業已確定、即將來五大國重開談話時、美國務卿已不能參加、届時將以吉伯生代表美國據美代表團某君言、吉伯生亦極能貫澈美國之主張、現史汀生將赴意國口岸、趁下一班郵船返美、史氏原擬取道法國口岸、今以泰狄歐不願來日内瓦、史汀生亦不願往巴黎、乃改道意國故此間亦認此事針鋒相對、頗堪尋味、</p>

<p>路透社二十九日日内瓦電今日軍縮會議海軍委員會集會時、德代表萊因巴登發言稱、「袖珍戰艦」之建造費、較主力艦約多半數、但各國若願减少主力艦之總噸數、則德國亦不惜犧牲其「袖珍艦」云、德代表且謂主力艦常用以封鎖海港、故間接上有攻擊對方之作用、是項用、係隨噸數多寡而增减云、日代表則稱、凡戰鬥品之性質、應視其用途如何而定、主力艦係海軍之重要部份、但如用台攻擊對方、則須賴他項戰艦同時並用云、美代表史璜生聲稱、美國負有保護巴拿馬運河安全之責任、主力艦爲美海軍之主要成素、如被廢除、則美國之國防須通盤改組云、英代表鮑潉德中將謂渠贊同美代表之意見、即主力艦僅屬禦性質也、英代表且謂主力艦能否轟毁陸地上之砲台、渠殊懷疑云、</p>
<p>國民社二十九日日内瓦電德總理白魯寗與美國務卿史汀生英相麥唐納作最後長談後已於今日啓程返柏林、德國駐法大使荷樞來日内瓦、向總理報告某項問題、亦同行、但抵巴塞耳後、荷樞將換車返巴黎、</p>

<p>崇明新開河趙某。務農爲業。家中豢鴿。鴿數十頭。前日鴿羣中忽雜一異鴿。形狀魁梧。不類凡品。趙遂以食爲餌。設計捕之。檢視其足上繫有軟鍚管一。細如箸。長約一寸許。管端有螺旋蓋。展而觀之。則赫然一紙外國文書也。趙本鄉人。中文且不識。何况外國文。持問鄰右。亦皆瞠目不知。事爲該邑沈縣長得悉。立以電話命該區區公所。以十元代價向趙購買。速送縣府研究。沈縣長固精解東文者。詳爲翻譯。方悉係日軍自瀏河發至上海之軍情報告。其中文意爲瀏河方面。缺乏馬糧。兵士多病。且不肯戰云云。沈即呈報省政府。轉請軍事當局備核焉。</p>
<h3>報話拾零</h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>余髫齡時。就讀於陳師朗如門下。師與先父交相莫逆。合訂申報一份。時則余鄉交通閉塞。舉全鎭所定報紙。僅二三份耳。余則每日以先父閲過之報。送至師處。終歲如是。無時或間。忠於此職。殆不啻一賣報童也。</p>
<p>僻鄉難得報紙。鄉人且不能識報紙。惟其腦海中。常有一申報在。凡見大幅之印刷物。輒日申報紙。惟其少也。而報紙之價値乃益貴。余家定閲報紙一份。而踵門索舊報者不絕。分與數紙。輒歸以補其敗壁。錯綜倒置。岡顧也。我國文化之未能普及。可見一斑。</p>
<p>報紙爲時代之表現。但其力亦足以改造時代。六十年來之申報。其鼓吹民權。倡言憲法。於民國之肇成。亦頗若干力量。然而時至今日。革命雖已告成。民權猶未實現。申報之應爲吾人努力者。更未能稍懈也。</p>

<p>— 雲間貧俠</p>
<p>湘人鄭識微。有口才。一貧如洗。日在茸城各茶肆藉拆字以度日。口若懸河。談言微中。故生涯頗不落寞。昨見其在望江樓爲少年拆一黨字。先問少年何用。少年日問時事耳。鄭乃揭開話匣。大放厥詞。日、論黨字之形。頗似規矩正直。無黨無偏。然黨字之首。是一小字。倒像一個黑胖子。頭戴瓜皮尖頂小唱難似入時。終覺有些尖頭把戲。且黨字上邊。是個尙字。佔全字十分之四。下邊是個黑字。倒佔全字十分之六。終嫌黑氣太重。到底不甚高尙。即以尙字論。除去小字。便成回。如於口字上加一小晝。便成同字。恐開黨同伐異之風。更恐演同而不和之象。况尙字中祇有口字。尤恐蹈口是心非。有口無心之弊。再以小字論之。其義雖小。所關實巨。若於小字下加一撇便成少字。近來年。多數喜事。多數氣盛。深恐少不更事。閙成極大禍胎。設竟禍端爆發。小民旣遭旡妄之災。大局亦受糜爛之害。故無論大小事件總以謹小愼微爲是。心中雖屬萬分痛苦。面上終須極端和平。際此小人得志之日。吾人憤懣之氣。萬萬不可少形於詞色。果爾。庶幾大事化爲小事。小事化爲無事。更以黑字論。現在是黑白混淆。非黑白分明之世。黑心者多。赤心者少。世界人類。多係黑眼鳥珠祇見白銀子一流。縱有明白人。亦多爲極大之黑氣所籠罩。而莫可如何。質言之。簡直不是黑暗世界。實已成爲黑暗地獄矣。於此而欲求一線光明。打破此黑漆皮燈籠。非上下心口致。合羣策羣力不爲功云云。少年探囊取輔幣券二角以酬之。鄭遂稱謝而去。</p>

<p>他便很興奮的答道。我要孤身奮鬥。自尋出路了。本來我進大學習政治法律。點兒没有用處。如今軍人當令。幹什麽都不如做軍官强。我趁此没有錢上學的當兒。不如及早改行。投筆從軍。聽説我那省城裏葉督軍葉作章。近來極力擴充軍隊。新設了個講武堂。招考學員。我打算就回去投考。一來藉此目前有個安身之所。得以維持生活。二來熬到畢業之後。弄個下級軍官做。也好竭力去奔前程。求發展。若是天從人願。有朝我也能握著大兵權。我誓必痛勦土匪。殺郤那牛黑風與我家父母報仇。梁笑雲聽到這裏。自已恰也把一口烟吸好。不禁噗哧一笑道。看你弗出。倒有𢜪大的志氣。只可惜有些像小孩子説夢話呢。如今炎凉世界。不論在任何軍政界作事。商有人特别提拔和没有奥援。單憑自已那點小本事去瞎闖。是永遠没有好希望的。你去幹一名講武堂的學員。費盡辛苦。三年畢業。至多不過弄一個連排長做。再要從這個起碼的下級官。巴望著一步一步高升到做師旅長。有大兵權到手。可以去勦滅牛黑風。那眞是比登天還難。恐怕是熬到頭髮白的那一天。也仍是白賣氣力。徒作空想。絕逹不到你的目的。你這計晝未免太迂拙了。安玉田被伊這一奚落。身上不由冷了大半截。只埀頭喪氣的答道。你的話固然很有見地。但我除此别無第二條路好走。便只好像老僧苦修的一般。混到那一步算那一步。梁笑雲微笑道。你這種聽天由命最卑怯的思想·我不大贊成。况且事在人爲。我也不信就會毫無辦法。據我看來。你的主意倒未嘗不對。雖説這條路你一個人未必走得通。但天地間能人甚多。難道就没有個把得力的朋友。能夠帮你的忙嗎。安玉田忙問道。你如今敎我求誰帮忙去。梁笑雲笑指著自已美玉琢成般的鼻子説道。眼前便有。你怎麽就没想到我呢。安玉田猛地一驚。就又追問著道。你會有什麽好法子。</p>

<h3>足堪紀念的事情</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>在某一個時期中，而突然發生一樁驚天動地的事件，則這事件必定使人腦筋中，容易記憶，容易令人永遠不忘，　　余昨天在增刋中，寫了一段小小的歷史，叙述余第二次入申報時期，家兄藴和看了，非常懷疑，我説是不差的，他説爲什麽？，我説我有一段驚奇的事實，足爲佐證，就是徐錫麟統制，剌殺滿人巡撫恩銘一事，我還出過徐錫麟書，去崇拜徐公，我還獲到不少的權利，這事多嗎悲壯而劇烈，留在我腦筋中，那能使我忘記呢，</p>
<p>就是馬老先生增刋六十年來上海之一文中，還提起康聖人賴嫖债一樁韻事，其時康没有辦法，眼睛一閉，計上心來，馬上跳入救命船中，一筆爛污賬，居然被能賴得乾乾淨淨，馬老先生記憶力雖强，但他今年已是九十三歲，經過奇形怪狀的事，不知多多少少，康聖人已是死了多年年，這段香艷的趣史，必定是三十年的故事，因馬老先生認爲這段故事，很有趣味，很在價値，所以他留在腦中，到現在還不肯忘記呢，昨日爲本報六十年大誔，我重提起悲壯而激烈的徐錫麟剌恩一事，馬相伯老先生提着了康聖人風流韻事，這類特殊而有趣味的事情，旣是令人勿忘，因爲本報六十年大慶的紀念，而提起這事，更足令人永遠勿忘，　　唉！你們不要忘記了本報六十年的紀念日，</p>

<p>[P科學黏合劑</p>
<p>— 黄胃</p>
<p>皮紙木材及玻璃，普通皆用膠黏合·，但是種黏料，遇水即失其效用，簿片松香（ShellacFlakes)，週水不濕，頗爲黏合品中之良劑，凡金屬及非金屬之物，皆可通用，法以薄片松香熱之，加火酒少許，使之溶解、即可應用。</p>
<p>玻璃之黏劑，却有數種··薄片松香亦其一，是種黏劑，祇可防水之浸入，若用於火酒中，即失其功效。故化學房及西藥店、多不得已用舶來之黏劑。然若取橡皮管少許，熱而溶之，再加炭化硫··（ＣarponＤisulphide）至成爲稀液時，便將此液敷在要接之處、其效用與舶來品無異。</p>
<p>鈉化砂酸鹽（ＳodiumＳilicare），爲玻璃與金屬之最好黏劑，其堅固之率，實非他類黏劑所能及。</p>
<p>以上數種玻璃之黏合劑，在商業上各有效用，各有其長。然若欲玻璃與玻璃黏合，使之透光，則不能不用加拿大之樹香。許多槍彈穿不過之玻璃，皆用多數極薄玻璃，用這種黏劑，黏合而成。</p>
<p>假象牙爲火綿與樟腦等之化合品，近來市上出品極多。風琴鋼琴之白板，兒童之玩具等皆是。若欲黏合，可取假象牙片少許，溶於阿西多尼（Ａcdfone）</p>

<h3>救國方案的片面觀事</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>自中國有了國難之後，我有意無意中已讀過好些學者名流的救國方案了。</p>
<p>又是救國方案！又是救國方案！</p>
<p>然而這些方案是否可以眞的救國呢？雖然這還是一個疑問（對不起！先生們，小子陪罪！），但是這大可以不去管它，爲什麽呢？因爲那至少也是深思熟慮的「具體計劃」，最低限度，在起草者本人是可以完全相信其「存在性」的吧？</p>
<p>有的主張一黨專政·，—他們説這是國家主義的主張·</p>
<p>有的主張和蘇聯復交·，—他們説這是左派的見地。（照中國法律這有共黨嫌疑。）</p>
<p>有的説聯美·，—這是那派的主張呢？</p>
<p>有的説始終信服國聯·，—這又是那一派的主張呢？………如此如此。</p>
<p>正義堂皇。路路皆通。</p>
<p>當然，有了「國難」便得「救國」，這是愛國志士所衆口同聲的。譬如歐戰時德國的政府名人都鼓吹着「爲祖國的光榮而戰」，蘇聯遇着列强進攻時，也煽惑工人們「擁護工人的祖國」，即如這次日本人亦高喊着「國難打開！」亦且爲了「維護本帝國之特殊權益與尊榮」，而不惜出重兵以「膺懲中國軍閥」。（謹按·，口吻巧極！）如此説來，中「國」之應「救」，乃是毫無疑義的，所餘者乃救國之道耳。</p>
<p>如此，這些洋洋大文眞是有用之極了。嗚呼！盛矣哉！</p>
<p>但是方案之施行、大有人在，他們是否肯就這様依照諸先生的「藥方」而「如法砲製」呢？否則，要施行就必須先行「執政」。那末假如自已執政以後又是否肯不昧前言的而平心做去呢？難道完全不爲本身的「利益」打算嗎？這可難説了。</p>
<p>至於先有救國方案之捉出然後或有執政的希望，以至跨入官衙的門檻，這該是必然之理了。</p>
<p>况且所謂國難不一定僅爲抗日，即如洛陽的國難會議所規定的討論範圍。所以，諸位學者名流們！你們還得趕快將「綏靖…」列入你們的方案中去，否則他日將不易實現諸先生所希望的彈冠相慶吧？</p>

<h3>兩個印象</h3>
<p>— 幹芳</p>
<p>砲聲遠了，學校裏的鐘聲響了·我想不到在祖國埀亡的時候，居然還有受敎育的一天·我挾着書包，幾乎喜得發了狂·</p>
<p>這是新遷的校址，校舍狹小·連休息室也没有·下了課，我獨自在晒臺上徘徊，因爲我是這次本校大减價才轉進來的·陌生生半個人兒也不識·無聊地翻開書，一半攤在欄干上，一半在手中·那兒看得見不面草塲上、談笑，打架，閙成一片·草塲近處四五個人坐成一個圓圈，他們手上都執着幾張小小的長方式的卡片，那紅的梅花，深深地吸引了我的注意力，我知道他們在打撲克·</p>
<p>急匆匆趕來，上課鐘已敲過，挨進敎室，坐位也没有了·一個不熟識的同學讓出一半來給我坐了·矮而且黑的敎師正在講『分化字例』·兩分鐘以後，他忽然停止了··」上課請不要吸烟！實在敎室太小，人數太多，空氣已經不清潔了·提　　起這些太傷心—我們自已寛大的講堂，被人家佔去了·』他的眼皮眨得更加快，誠懇凄惶的向着後排個吸着香烟的同學發言·但是他又覺得這様講太使他難堪，於是忙掩飾着説··「我也是個烟王，祇是不在敎室中抽罷了·」</p>
<p>這是什麽時候？砲未停，兵未退，國仇未復·我們是青年，此志豈容少懈·可是第一次給與我的印象是如此，使我的熱血從頭頂冷到脚踵·我知道了，這是大學敎育的成績！我寫到此地，熱誠地希望我們的引導者，尤其辦大學敎育的人，不要空談救國，受的敎育不適合於今日·這班半墮落的青年·這班將來中國的主人翁，不加深切的改造，嚴格的訓練·再任全們自由放縱，那我們預備着看中國滅亡罷！良心逼迫着我以血和淚向我親愛的敎師們請願·</p>
<p>一鳞一爪</p>
<h3>别開生面的慰勞品</h3>
<p>— 滄</p>
<p>此次引起世界上表同情，爲民族爭生存的滬上戰爭，雖我民衆尙難得到最後的勝利，但是一般民衆，大都很熱烈的來慰勞我忠勇而爲民族爭光的武裝同志、實在不少，除錢不計外，其他軍用品需用品，也不可勝數，在這許多慰勞品的中間，最値得我們注意的，有三位慰勞品，都是不可思議的，一、是一位美國人，他拿了五元美金來慰勞，并且他有一信，説了許多敬偑的話，末了，他説這五元是不夠分配諸位弟兄的，不過希望都購幾粒子彈來抵抗無人道的敵人，</p>
<p>一、是南洋的僑胞，他寄來商務印書館的兩張書劵，牠的價値，祇有二元角，他也信上説，這一些並不能慰勞你們，不過請你們多買幾粒子彈罷了，</p>
<p>一、是送一件馬褂來慰勞，亦且没有説明他的用意，令人莫明其妙，這以上三件的慰勞品，豈不是别開生面呢？</p>
<p>胡説</p>
<h3>誰是賣國賊</h3>
<p>— 白匋</p>
<p>前幾天報紙上曾登載了熊希齡先生致汪院長精衛先生的一封信，這封信的大意大致是説汪院長曾在中央紀念週説··熊先生是二十一條的副署者，是個賣國賊！此人現在上海，如果他到洛陽來參加國難會議，我們殺死他！於是熊先生申辯，他雖然在民國四年做過國務總理，但簽定賣國條約二十一條的時候，他却已去職，要請汪院長查清樘案再説。並敬告汪院長，當此國難臨頭的時節，身居要職，自家尤須爲國愼重。大人先生們的是非曲直，我們老百姓雅不願意多所批評，但熊先生不是簽定賣國條約二十一條的副署者，的確是眞的。那末，簽定賣國條約的賣國賊，究竟是誰呢？</p>
<p>不是别人，正是大名鼎鼎的賣國賊曹陸章三人之中的陸增祥。據説，陸增祥因爲簽定賣國條約，自已懺悔不及，現在棄了家室，跑到外國去做和尙了！</p>
<p>在這個國家危亡的時節，這種舊賬，可以不算若要算起舊賬來，這種舊賬恐算勝不算呢，不過「舊賬未清，免開尊口」舊賬雖可以不算，但新賬决不容再加，國家將亡，必有妖孽，倘若這個時候，不出岳飛，却再出了數多秦檜，如何辦法，寄語老百姓莫放過賣國賊！</p>
<p>電影</p>
<h3>觀「天香國色」後</h3>
<p>近日開映於南京大戲院之本年再度被舉爲電影帝后却爾福雷珍妮蓋諾合演空前巨片『天香國色』。係溶合悲哀詼諧及音樂於一爐之傑作。天下之事。不如意者常居八九。天下之人。傷心者居其泰半。彼片中之珍妮却爾。亦一例耳。苟使有情人終成眷屬。則唱隨之樂。自不待言。無如天心不仁。焚琴煑鶴。一一吊夢温愁。痛風嗟月。嗟夫。珍却爾之表演。細膩深刻感人深矣。滑稽明星安爾勃雷德。在『五十年後新世界』中。其表情已予吾人深刻之印象。今復在該片中串插令人發　噴飯之笑料。俾吾人於悲哀中。獲得相當之樂趣。其調劑殊適佳也。是片純爲音樂藝術化。有出諸美國近代譜曲大家甘勳氏手之新歌六曲。詞句深邃。非同凡響。而配以曼妙之音樂。配角邱麗兒。作風潑辣騒蕩。此片在美國最大之洛賽戲院開眏。打破歷年售座紀錄。非倖致焉。</p>
<h3>卡爾登映「療情記」</h3>
<p>卡爾登開眏之『療情記』一片。係從數百部英國影片中選出之一部絕妙精品。美國最大影片公司米高梅。曾出鉅資購得該片全美之放映權。當在美國開映時。所有觀衆。莫不同聲讚美。賣座之盛。打破任何。紀錄。蓋是片不但情節緊凑。而其結搆優異。不落尋常窠臼。尤爲難能。至於主演此片者。則爲譽噪一時之倫敦舞台明星。其表演之逼眞。確能催淚銷魂也。</p>
<h3>「斷腸花」將近開映</h3>
<p>一個弱小女子。他一心要向上。但是那不幸的命運。惡劣的環境。以及社會的抨擊。偏要將她趕到地獄中去。這是一件多麽痛心的事。那『斷腸花』一片的能夠賺人流淚的原因。就在乎此。『斷腸花『片中的她。本來是一位非常賢淑的小家碧玉。但是那不幸的命運。一步不離的追隨着她。使她潦倒一生。且她因援助愛子成名。竟不惜犧牲色相。幹那賣笑生涯。結果愛兒雖幸功成名就。然而她可就憔悴不堪了。總之此片自始至終。可以説是幕幕是血。字字是淚。富有情感的人看了當然不必説。即使鐵石心腸人觀之。亦將爲之淚下。還有一件最難得的事。就是主角漢倫女士。一人兼飾四個時代角色。並皆維妙維肖其化裝的技術。表演的天能。非具有藝術天才者。是决不能勝任的。聽說這本片子。不久將在國泰大、開映了。</p>

        <h1>1932.05.01</h1>
<h3>Tragic May</h3>
<p>May has arrived. Today is the beginning of May. May is tragic, great, and worthy of tears and songs. In the pages of history, May is filled with glory and victory, but also with sorrow and humiliation.</p>
<p>Let us look back at the pages of history. Today—May 1st—is the Labor Day that all laborers around the world most deserve to commemorate. The origin of Labor Day was the resolution passed at a meeting of the eight major labor unions in Chicago, USA, on October 7, 1884, to hold a movement every year on May 1st to demand an eight-hour work system. May 1, 1886, was designated as the date of the first demonstration. Since then, "May 1st" has become a day of commemoration for workers all over the world and a glorious and great revolutionary commemorative day.</p>
<p>Two days after today is "May 3rd." What kind of commemoration is May 3rd? We should not have forgotten it yet. In 1928, Japan dispatched troops to Shandong twice to obstruct the progress of China's revolutionary movement, creating the May 3rd Massacre. To this day, the bloodstains on the city walls of Jinan are still fresh, and the bullet marks are still there. This deep shame, this deep mark of the whip, should not have been completely wiped away from our hearts.</p>
<p>The day after that is the famous "May Fourth." The outbreak of the May Fourth Movement was in the fourth year of the Republic of China. The immediate cause of its outbreak was the coercion of Japan's Twenty-One Demands and the stimulation of the traitorous behavior of the warlord government. Its significance was a democratic movement against imperialism and warlords, that is, a new cultural movement that marked an era. After the May Fourth Movement, China's culture clearly turned in a new direction.</p>
<p>Next is "May 9th." May 9th is the most painful page in our nation's history. On this day in the fourth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai, the Beiyang warlord who dreamed of reviving the ashes of the imperial system, signed the most shameful and painful Twenty-One Demands with Japan on that day, disregarding public opinion, because Japan used the Aizemei memorandum as the final coercion. The content of these Twenty-One Demands was extremely harsh, not only enough to destroy our country, but also enough to exterminate our race. However, the Yuan government completely disregarded the interests of the nation and did not hesitate to sell out the country for its own benefit. This is enough to prove that imperialism and warlords depend on each other. If we want to seek freedom and equality for our nation in the future, we must fundamentally overthrow the warlords.</p>
<p>The last day of this month is "May 30th." Everyone may not have forgotten the blood-stained "May 30th." Although the dust on Nanjing Road has lightly buried the bloodstains of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, this massacre has left an indelible history.</p>
<p>After we have reviewed the great and humiliating old accounts of the past, what are our feelings? Moreover, our country is currently in a "difficult situation" of national crisis and survival. Under this difficult situation, how will we feel when we spend this tragic May? The May of the future is waiting for us to create new glory and greatness.</p>
<h3>Results of the League of Nations Assembly Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Resolution on the Shanghai Sino-Japanese Armistice</p>
<p>The Special Committee's Report Submitted to the Assembly</p>
<p>Passed Unanimously by All Except Japan Abstaining</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Geneva, 30th—The League of Nations Assembly convened this morning, chaired by Foreign Minister Hymans. The resolution drafted by the Committee of Nineteen and attached to the Lampson Compromise was passed unanimously. The report submitted by the Committee of Nineteen stated that there are still 20,000 Japanese troops in Shanghai. It is feared that renewed hostilities will erupt if the armistice negotiations are not completed swiftly and smoothly.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 30th—The League of Nations Assembly convened at 10:40 this morning to consider the Shanghai situation, chaired by Foreign Minister Hymans. The meeting was held in the same hall as the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference. Hymans first expressed his regret for the Shanghai Hongkou Park bombing, saying: "We are deeply saddened and angered by such acts of violence upon hearing of the large number of casualties. I sincerely wish all those injured a speedy recovery. I visited Mr. Nagaoka yesterday to express my condolences, and I now express them again in public." After Nagaoka expressed his thanks, Hymans rose to describe the situation of the Shanghai negotiations, saying: "I can now report to you that hostilities in Shanghai ceased several weeks ago, which is very gratifying." He then summarized the details of the negotiated armistice agreement and stated, "I would especially like to draw your attention to the organization of the Joint Committee. The method of its organization and the powers conferred upon it, which are to provide factual and certain proof of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, are, of course, the most important parts of the agreement agreed upon by both sides." He then read out the draft revised resolution proposed by the Committee of Nineteen and distributed the committee's report, stating that the armistice agreement is expected to be signed soon. He then invited the assembly to discuss the resolution and the report. The Chinese representative, Yan Huiquing, was the first to speak, stating that China always listens to the League of Nations' proposals. He asked the assembly to note that Japanese troops are still stationed on Chinese territory. This is an undeclared war of aggression by Japan against China, and the victim is still allowed to be occupied by all the unreasonably seized possessions, which is a most regrettable precedent. He then detailed the progress of the Shanghai armistice negotiations, declaring that China has accepted the proposed armistice conditions everywhere, but Japan has rejected China's acceptance everywhere. This resolution is entirely for the sake of maintaining peace, but it still recognizes that the continued stationing of Japanese troops on Chinese territory is a serious violation of China's territorial integrity. He declared that although China accepts the resolution in its entirety, it still reserves all rights under the League of Nations Covenant and international law. He further emphasized the importance of Sections Six, Seven, and Ten, declaring that China hopes that the situation created by the occupation of Chinese territory by foreign troops will not become an international precedent. The Japanese representative, Nagaoka, rose to speak, stating that Japan has constantly sought agreement in the armistice negotiations. He believes that what has been agreed upon in this meeting is in line with all the conditions in the League of Nations resolution. He stated that although Japan is forced to abstain from voting, it can assure the Assembly that Japan does not change its desire to implement the agreement perfectly. When the Shanghai armistice conference reopens in May, Japan will be prepared to sign the armistice agreement. Finally, Nagaoka thanked the friendly nations for their mediation and expressed special gratitude to British Minister Lampson. As for Japan's intention to abstain from voting, Nagaoka declared before the vote that the Japanese delegation did not consider itself in a position to speak on the draft resolution, so it wished to refrain from voting. However, the Japanese government still maintains its original position regarding the reservation that the application of Article 15 of the Covenant to the Sino-Japanese dispute should always be reserved. But I can assure the Assembly that the Japanese government's attitude does not change its firm determination to strive for the Shanghai negotiations to be completed with the least possible delay. Hymans then announced that the Assembly would vote on the resolution and the committee's report. When Japan was called, Nagaoka again stated that he would refrain from voting. After the roll call, Hymans declared that both motions had been passed unanimously, as Japan should be considered absent according to the rules. The chairman then thanked the representatives, stating that he hoped the armistice agreement would be faithfully implemented and asked all countries with diplomatic representatives in Shanghai to effectively supervise the implementation of the agreement. Finally, the British representative thanked the chairman on behalf of the assembly, and the meeting adjourned at 11:45. Today, four Americans, Gilbert, Wilson, and Marina, attended the meeting as observers, occupying half of the seats prepared for non-member observers, which shows the attention of the Americans.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Geneva, 29th—Today, the Committee of Nineteen passed a resolution expressing condolences to those injured in the Shanghai bombing. The committee held a closed meeting at 5:00 PM and adjourned at 6:20 PM. Afterwards, a communique was issued stating that the committee had drafted a report in accordance with Section 1, Article 3 of the League of Nations Assembly's resolution of March 11, which will be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly tomorrow.

<h3>Condolences from Various Countries</h3>

<h3>Will Not Affect Shanghai Case</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th—After a meeting of the Foreign Minister, Army Minister, and Navy Minister this afternoon, it was reported to the Emperor that it had been decided to view the Shanghai armistice agreement and the Hongkou bombing as completely separate matters that are not related. Japan's attitude towards the armistice agreement negotiations will not change, and it will strive to conclude the agreement as soon as possible. Reuters, Tokyo, 30th—The signing of the Shanghai armistice agreement has been temporarily delayed due to the bombing in Hongkou Park, in which many Japanese diplomatic and military authorities were injured. However, government officials hope to find a way to conclude the Shanghai armistice agreement within the shortest possible time. Although Minister Shigemitsu Kui was seriously injured, he dictated several telegrams, which were recorded and reported to the Japanese government, saying that he was deeply sorry for not being able to continue his work due to his injuries and hoped that the government would conclude the Shanghai negotiations within the possible scope, as the conclusion of the armistice agreement is very important.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th—Japanese newspapers here have expressed surprise at the Hongkou Park bombing and said that the signing of the Shanghai armistice agreement is bound to be delayed, which is regrettable. It is generally expected that this shocking incident will not affect Sino-Japanese relations. Since the scene of the incident is within the Japanese sphere of influence and the perpetrator is a Japanese subject, the Japanese authorities have no intention of protesting to China. The tone of the newspapers on this incident is quite stable, as the purpose of the perpetrator in the case is still unclear at this time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Discusses Aftermath</h3>
<p>Consulate Meeting At 9:30 yesterday morning, Japanese Consul Iguchi, Second Secretaries Horiuchi and Moriya, Adjutant Mizuno, Staff Officer Abe, Naval Chief of Staff Shimada, Colonel Kita, Chief of Staff Tashiro, and other Japanese naval and military officers and diplomats gathered at the Japanese Consulate General to discuss the aftermath of the bombing and the countermeasures to be taken at the armistice conference.</p>
<p>Veterans After the bombing, Japanese residents became extremely uneasy. The Japanese Veterans Association also held an executive meeting at 4:00 yesterday afternoon to discuss countermeasures, and will make a statement in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Suspects Not Released</h3>
<p>The culprit and suspects captured on the spot the day before yesterday are still under strict interrogation in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Jiangwan. The culprit is calm, and the suspects are still detained and have not been released. According to Japanese sources, Yoon Bong-gil is one of the Korean suspects arrested. The person who threw the bomb on the spot was a Korean with the surname Li.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Reports</h3>
<p>From the Mainland Newspaper: The Mainland Newspaper reports that after the bombing in Hongkou Park yesterday, Mr. Hibbard, an American from the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau, was also detained for two hours. Mr. Hibbard resides at No. 41 Jiangwan Road, near the park. He saw Japanese soldiers chasing two Chinese workers from the Public Works Department and stepped forward to intercede, and was thus detained along with them. It is said that the two Chinese workers were working in the park, and after the bombing occurred, they saw Japanese soldiers coming to arrest them. The Chinese workers fled, and the Japanese soldiers chased them to Mr. Hibbard's residence. Afterward, the American Consulate General was informed and negotiated with the Japanese authorities, demanding the release of Mr. Hibbard. If he was suspected of committing a crime, they requested that he be handed over to the American authorities for trial; otherwise, he should be released immediately. The Japanese authorities then summoned Mr. Hibbard for questioning and released him.</p>
<p>From the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury: The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the bombing in Hongkou Park yesterday morning injured eleven people. Mr. Kawabata, the administrative chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association, died this morning at 4:00 AM in Fukumin Hospital due to his injuries. Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu's condition remained critical this afternoon, according to sources in Fukumin Hospital. The ambassador suffered more than twenty shrapnel wounds and reportedly groaned in pain throughout the night. Doctors administered painkillers and performed surgery to remove metal fragments embedded deep in his abdomen and lower limbs. The condition of the other injured individuals has improved today. Commander Nomura suffered severe head injuries and may lose his right eye (according to the Mainland Newspaper, the left eyeball has been removed), but his overall condition is good. Commander Shirakawa suffered several injuries, the most severe of which was to his jaw. Commander Ueda suffered severe leg injuries and may require amputation of several toes. Consul Murai has made great progress today, and if there are no unexpected changes, he may be able to return to the office in two weeks. Mr. Tomono, the secretary-general of the Japanese Residents' Association, suffered arm injuries, but they are not serious. Other minor injuries include two Japanese soldiers, one Japanese sailor, and one photographer from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun. According to sources from the Japanese Consulate General this morning, the Japanese military and civilian authorities have begun preliminary investigations into the bombing. It is believed that several people were detained after the incident due to suspected involvement. Yesterday afternoon and evening, several more suspects were arrested. Many of those detained after the incident yesterday morning have been released after interrogation. There are still several people in custody, but the exact number is unknown. However, it was heard this morning that there were a total of eight people, three of whom are Korean. It is now believed that the rest are Chinese. The Korean who threw the bomb, Yun Bong-gil, was severely beaten by the Japanese after his arrest, and was covered in bruises. He was later rescued by the Japanese military police and Japanese business groups. Last night, the French police, at the request of the Japanese authorities, arrested at least one Korean within the French Concession. In addition, Koreans suspected of engaging in anti-Japanese activities are currently being pursued by the Japanese. This morning, the authorities did not want to state whether the case was committed by one person, a small group, or part of a larger assassination plot. The deceased, Mr. Kawabata, was one of the oldest and most respected members of the Japanese community. He came to Shanghai from Osaka to practice medicine before the Russo-Japanese War. He was elected as the vice-chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association several years ago, and as the chairman two years ago. His elderly mother is in Shanghai, and his siblings are in Osaka. Mr. John Keswick, the Secretary General of the Public Works Bureau, sent a letter on behalf of the Bureau this morning to the Japanese Residents' Association to express condolences for the death of Mr. Kawabata. Mr. Henry de Gray, Chairman of the Public Works Bureau, also sent a letter to Japanese Consul Iguchi this morning to express condolences to those injured yesterday and hope for their speedy recovery.</p>
<h3>Crisis for Korean Residents in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Searching for Li Chunshan: Since the incident occurred and the Korean Yun Bong-gil was arrested on the spot, the Japanese Military Police Headquarters has conducted a detailed investigation. The Japanese side has kept the suspect's confession a secret. The interrogation revealed that Li Chunshan, the president of the Korean Residents' Association residing in the French Concession, is a major suspect. Therefore, at 1:00 PM that afternoon, the Japanese Consulate General dispatched several plainclothes detectives with a warrant to the French police, demanding the arrest and extradition of Li. The French police dispatched a criminal squad to search Li's residence at No. 27 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre. However, Li was not at home at the time. After a thorough search by the Japanese police, nothing was found.</p>
<p>Arresting Ahn Changho: Since they failed to arrest Li,</p>
<p>a few Japanese police officers were left to guard Li's residence. Not long after, a Korean man in his fifties came to Li's residence to visit Li. As soon as he entered, he was arrested by the Japanese police. At the time, they suspected that the man was Li Chunshan and immediately took him to the French Police Headquarters in Louzawei. After a detailed interrogation by the chief of police, it turned out that the man was not Li Chunshan, but the leader of the Korean Revolution, Ahn Changho. The Japanese then became even more concerned and demanded his extradition. Although Ahn tried his best to explain and was rescued by influential Korean residents, Ahn was ultimately unable to obtain protection as a political prisoner and was extradited to the Japanese embassy.</p>
<p>A Brief Biography of Ahn: Ahn is a mentor of the Korean Revolution. He was originally from Pyongyang, Korea, and is now 53 years old. His family were farmers. He was intelligent and began engaging in revolutionary activities in his youth. The most powerful "New People's Association" in Korea was founded by Ahn. Initially, he gathered young people from all over Korea, numbering nearly ten thousand, to restore national sovereignty. Unfortunately, the effort failed, and he fled overseas. He went to the United States and formed a revolutionary organization with Korean residents in America. When the "March 1st Movement" occurred, he came to Shanghai from the United States to preside over the independence movement. All Koreans engaged in revolutionary activities in various places were under Ahn's command. He has been fighting for more than forty years. He once served as the Prime Minister of the Korean Provisional Government. His revolutionary history and outstanding spirit are similar to those of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in China.</p>
<p>Implicating Korean Residents: Since Ahn was arrested, the Korean residents in the French Concession have been in a state of panic. Until 2:30 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese embassy sent dozens of plainclothes detectives in twelve trucks directly to the French police, demanding an urgent search of Korean residents' residences in various locations. The French police agreed and ordered several detectives to accompany them. At around 4:00 AM, one person, a Korean with the surname Kim, was captured at Hui Sheng Hospital at No. 446 Xinmin Village, Rue Boileau. Two people were captured at No. 388 Route Lafayette, one being Park Jegeon, 22 years old, currently working as a ticket inspector No. 79 at the British-American Tramway Company, and the other being Park's younger brother, only 17 years old, currently studying at the Baptist Church on the Avenue de la Republique.</p>
<p>Arrest of Seventeen People: In addition to the above two locations, four people were captured at No. 65 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre, with unknown surnames. One person, named Zhang Quanjin, 28 years old, was captured at No. 8 Puqing Lane, Rue Massenet. When he was arrested, he was very calm and told people that since things had come to this, he did not care. He asked himself if he could face all his Korean compatriots and his motherland. After that, many people were arrested in Xin Xin Li, Dapu Bridge, and other places. As of last night, a total of seventeen people had been arrested and sent to the Japanese Military Headquarters for interrogation. There are about ten thousand Korean residents in the French Concession. Since this incident occurred, they have all felt that their protection has been completely lost, and everyone is in danger.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Representatives Signing the Ceasefire Agreement</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Represented by Consul Murai</p>
<p>Since the informal meeting days ago, the British Minister Lampson's compromise on the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops has been passed, the ceasefire agreement has been completed in effect. In recent days, the Japanese military and political leaders were bombed in Hongkou Park, the ceasefire conference may be affected due to the injury of the Japanese representatives. Yesterday, the Chinese, British and Japanese diplomatic authorities had negotiations and decided not to be halted due to this incident.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Representative for Signing: However, the Japanese representatives, such as Commander Ueda and Ambassador Shigemitsu, have all been injured in the bombing and cannot leave the hospital for a while, the signing may become a problem. It is heard that the Japanese Embassy received instructions from the Tokyo Foreign Ministry yesterday morning, and plans to appoint Consul Murai as the representative for signing. It is said that Murai suffered the lightest injury and will recover soon. The Japanese Embassy immediately notified the British Minister to convey the request for agreement to our side. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi went to the British Consulate General yesterday morning to meet with British Minister Lampson to discuss the matter. Vice Minister Guo also sent a telegram to Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan of Nanjing, last night to ask for instructions on the issue of the Japanese representative for signing. According to Japanese sources, although Consul Murai's injuries are minor, he will have to stay in the hospital for two weeks before he can be discharged. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa has appointed Yano, the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, as the representative for signing. The status of the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy is higher than that of the First Secretary and the Consul General. Yano is currently in Peiping, and the Japanese government has telegraphed him to come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Date of Signing the Agreement: It is heard in Geneva that the special committee of the League of Nations Council held a public meeting yesterday, so the ceasefire agreement here is only waiting for a scheduled signing. According to foreign sources, the agreement is scheduled to be signed tomorrow, but it has not been officially confirmed. Diplomatic circles only say that the signing can be expected within next Thursday.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Postage Increases</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks Again to Retract the Order</p>
<p>The issue of postage increases has attracted much attention from all sectors. Mr. Chapin, the Postmaster of the Municipal Postal Administration, was ordered by the Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications to increase postage rates in 63 districts, excluding the three northeastern provinces. Domestic green, local yellow, and international blue stamps for ordinary letters will be permitted from May 1st. All letters, postcards, books, printed matter, trade contracts, samples, postage, registered mail return receipts, express mail, and package receipts, and various handling fees will be revised uniformly. Although the Municipal Chamber of Commerce continued to telegram the Executive Yuan yesterday, asking to retract the order again, no reply was received. The original telegram is as follows: To the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications of Nanjing: The association has telegraphed this month regarding the case of postage increases, with book postage increasing by two to three times, requesting that fees continue to be charged according to the old regulations. No reply has been received. It is now heard that the implementation is imminent. Cultural institutions, commercial organizations, and individuals from all commercial and academic circles in this city believe that the post office is a state-run enterprise and not like merchants who aim to profit. At a time when the national economy is declining to the extreme and cultural progress is plummeting, postal fees should not be further increased, tending towards a suicidal policy. They have been actively arguing and pleading. I respectfully telegram your esteemed yuan and ministry to review and approve, and considering the importance of postal fees to the prosperity and decline of people's livelihoods and the growth and decline of culture, resolutely abolish the established case of postage increases, to show recovery. The telegram is sent urgently, awaiting orders. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows, caught.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Authorities in the Concession Strengthen Joint Defense in May</h3>
<p>Banning All Assemblies and Parades</p>
<p>Dispatching Double Guards to Check Pedestrians on All Main Roads</p>

Inspectors claim that female inspectors will depart to various locations to check pedestrians. At 9:00 PM, a special curfew will be declared, cutting off traffic and prohibiting pedestrians until 5:00 AM the next morning. The authorities also sent personnel to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department of the Public Concession and the French Concession Municipal Bureau Police Department to discuss joint defense measures. As a result, the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession notified each police station in May to strengthen prevention. Chinese and Western detectives are deployed to the junctions of the Chinese Concession to guard and check pedestrians.</p>

<p>[The Public Works Bureau Prevents Japanese Military Parades]</p>
<p>Reply to the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce had previously sent letters to the Public Works Bureau protesting the rumors that the Japanese military would parade on North Sichuan Road on the Emperor's Birthday. It is now heard that the Public Works Bureau has replied, saying, "We received your letter of April 29th, informing us that the Japanese military will hold a parade on the Emperor's Birthday and requesting that we stop it to avoid accidents. Your letter was sent on April 29th, and the Japanese military parade was scheduled for that morning. However, on April 27th, we received notice from the Japanese military authorities through the police department that the celebration ceremony would include a military action-like event in the concession. We immediately notified the Japanese authorities, requesting that they stop all actions that would increase the tension. We are replying to your letter accordingly."</p>
<p>Reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau, requesting that it investigate and stop the Japanese military from parading in the concession under the pretext of celebrating the Emperor's Birthday, as this would easily cause trouble and reassure the people. It is now learned that the Public Works Bureau replied to the association yesterday, saying, "We received your letter stating that the Japanese residents in Shanghai intend to parade in celebration of the Emperor's Birthday and requesting our bureau to prevent it to maintain security. We are aware of this. However, we must inform you that your letter was dated April 29th, and the Japanese parade was scheduled to take place on the morning of that day. We must inform you that on April 27th, we learned that the Japanese celebration would include a military action-style program on the roads of the concession. At that time, we immediately and urgently negotiated with the Japanese authorities, requesting that they not take any actions that would increase the tension in the situation." We are replying specifically and hope for your understanding. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs a Request to Lift the Ban on Cash Shipments</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the ban on cash shipments is hindering finance and the people's livelihood after the war, with a huge impact. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, saying, "To the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance of Nanjing: Since the Northeast Incident, followed by the Shanghai War, various places have successively banned the export of cash, especially in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Shantou. It is important to know that the circulation of goods in various places depends entirely on whether silver coins can be adjusted. Therefore, the flow of silver coins is closely related to the prosperity and decline of industry and commerce. Now, if the export of cash is banned, the adjustment will lose its normal state, and goods will be accumulated in various places, and silver coins will be滞塞 in the metropolis. Both do not seek each other, and the situation in various cities will inevitably become paralyzed, and the harm is unimaginable. It is appropriate to telegraph your government and departments to review and approve, and quickly order all provinces to cancel the ban on cash shipments, to comply with the fundamental purpose of economic circulation, which is convenient for the public. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows, trapped.</p>
<h3>Money Dealers Will Abolish Restrictions on Inter-Bank Transfers from Today</h3>
<p>Restoring the Normal State Before January 28th</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, the banking industry has organized a Joint Reserve Committee, and the money industry has organized a Special Property Custody Committee to regulate finance. In order to prevent the outflow of cash, the money industry has limited the transfer of tickets registered by various firms to inter-bank transfers. However, for customers who need cash to purchase daily necessities and for foreign firms to ship goods, flexible measures were taken. It has been decided by a meeting of member representatives that from today, the normal state before January 28th will be restored, and restrictions on inter-bank transfers will be abolished to facilitate the circulation of finance in various industries.</p>

<h3>The Postal Workers Union and the Labor Union Express Grave Concern About the Postage Increase</h3>
<p>Proposing Concrete Plans</p>
<p>Submitting a Petition to the Ministry for Implementation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has ordered the Directorate General of Posts to implement the postage increase from May 1st. Various groups have submitted petitions to retract the order. Some people went to the Postal Workers Union and the Labor Union to inquire about their opinions. According to the committee members in charge of the union, they said that the postage increase will increase the burden on the people, and they do not agree with it in principle. However, the postal business did incur losses last year, and the biggest reason was due to natural disasters and man-made disasters. However, natural disasters and man-made disasters are temporary phenomena. Is there a need to increase postage for this temporary loss, and are there other fundamental ways to remedy the postal service besides increasing postage? The members of the two unions are logically reviewing the facts of the postal service, various statistics, and collecting opinions from postal workers across the country, and are preparing concrete plans to consolidate the postal base and facilitate the people. It will be completed soon, and concrete suggestions will be made to the Ministry of Communications. Regarding the maintenance of the postal service and the reduction of the burden on the people, the two unions and all postal workers across the country have the greatest determination and are willing to be the vanguard of the people and strive to promote its realization.</p>
<h3>The Bookstore Industry in Peiping Opposes the Postage Increase</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bookstore Industry Association received a telegram yesterday from the Jin De Society of the industry in Peiping, saying, "The method announced by the Ministry of Communications to increase postage fees, the book delivery fee, has greatly increased, affecting the dissemination of culture. At a time when the people and businesses are struggling and education is falling, how can this be done? Our association sent a telegram to the National Government and other agencies yesterday, saying, 'The National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Interior in Nanjing, it is reported that the postage increase method greatly increases the delivery of books, increasing the burden on the people and hindering the progress of culture. At this time of poverty among the people and the closure of businesses, this topsy-turvy policy is deeply shocking and is contrary to the principles of the late Premier to reduce book and newspaper postage and promote education. We should request the retraction of the order. We are eagerly awaiting this.' We are sending this telegram to you to ask your association to work hard to protest and achieve the goal of cancellation. We hope that the cultural institutions in Peiping will also rise up to resist.</p>
<h3>The Bookstore Industry in Anhui Opposes the Postage Increase Congratul</h3>
<p>Telegram 1: To the Shanghai Bookstore Industry Association, greetings. The Ministry of Communications is planning to increase book postage by two to three times, hindering culture more than anything else, and greatly conflicting with the government's purpose of spending huge sums of money to develop education. Our association heard this and was greatly shocked. In addition to petitioning the government to retract the order, we have also received unanimous support from all sectors. Respectfully, the book is especially strong, striving for the future of the country, especially the future of culture. The Bookstore Industry Association of Ning County, Anhui Province, bows.</p>
<p>Telegram 2 To the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Education: The Ministry of Communications' proposal to increase postage fees has been decided to be implemented in May of this year. In the aftermath of the disasters, the people's strength has been extremely depleted, and suddenly increasing taxes, how can they survive? And especially for books and printing, the increase is two to three times, hindering culture more than anything else. Although the government is exploring financial resources and the situation is unavoidable, this method is tantamount to implementing a policy of fooling the people. How can we comfort the spirit of the late Premier in heaven and maintain the Kuomintang's policy of promoting culture? Our association believes that this matter is related to the people's livelihood, national culture, and the credibility of the party, and we especially telegraph you to request that you retract the order and postpone its implementation. The Anhui Library Association bows.</p>
<p>[Regular Meeting of the Jiangnan Seawall Aftermath Association]</p>
<p>Deciding on Both Stopgap and Fundamental Solutions</p>
<p>Hiring Five More Committee Members, Including Zhao Housheng</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Seawall Aftermath Committee held its third meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the association's office. Attendees included Committee Members Lin Kanghou, Chen Guangfu, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Zhao Jinqing, Zhu Ziqiao, Shen Lisun, Wu Yun, etc. Observers included Shen Yi, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau, etc. Chairman Chen Guangfu reported on the opening of the meeting. First, Committee Member Shen Lisun reported on the recent progress of the association's affairs and the financial status of office expenses. Then, Committee Member Jin Houcheng reported on the process of contacting various parties to survey the seawall. A total of six survey quotas were available, half of which were from provincial and municipal government departments, and half of which were from the local level, generated by the Taibao Two Counties Seawall Protection Committee. The survey locations started from Wusong and went along Baoshan to Liuhe, and ended at Yanglinkou. Later, various committee members reported on the progress of contacting the central, provincial, municipal, and people's sides to deal with the seawall repair funds. The most important suggestion was Zhang Gongquan's proposal for a fundamental solution, which advocated imitating Changsha and Hankou by collecting 2% of the seawall repair funds under the customs duties, so that 1.7 million yuan could be obtained annually under the Jianghai Customs duties. In this way, a permanent Jiangnan Seawall agency could be established once and for all. In addition, methods such as collecting a special cigarette tax or allocating a part of the cigarette tax were also possible. (The original text of the proposal is detailed in yesterday's newspapers.) It was decided to suggest that the government request adoption. As for the current stopgap solution, it was decided to recommend Deputy Committee Member Mu Qichu, Committee Member Du Yuesheng, Committee Member Lin Kanghou, Committee Member Wang Yiting, and Committee Member Chen Guangfu to contact each other. Furthermore, since the matter concerns finance, Provincial Finance Director Shu and Municipal Finance Director Cai should be invited to discuss concrete solutions, and it was also decided to advance funds to start construction. Director Dong should also be invited to attend the temporary meeting on May 5th. Next, Director Shen Yi reported on the seawall plan in the Gaohang area of the city, advocating that new and old projects should be used together, which was highly praised by the committee members. The meeting adjourned at 6:45 PM.</p>

<h3>Detectives Bravely Act, No Thief Escapes</h3>
<p>Two Killed...Two Captured Alive...One Wounded by Gunfire</p>
<p>At 7:20 PM on April 29th, five bandits, Zhang Jinkuan, Jiang Chang'an, Zheng Haiqing, Zhou San, and Jin Dasanzi, all from Jiangbei, broke into the home of Zhu Longhai at No. 426 Maigen Road, armed with weapons. Zheng suddenly took out a pistol, threatening them to remain silent, and drove Zhu Longhai and others into a room, monitoring their movements, and then carried out a robbery. At that time, Zhu's co-residents, Xi Dongsheng and Xu Hongsheng, took the opportunity to sneak out and secretly report to Chinese detective Gao Huixian, who reported to the Gordon Road Patrol Station. The patrol captain immediately dispatched Chinese detective chief Shen Chongli, patrolmen Liang Yuliang, Li Baichuan, and Liu Chunshu, and Western detective chief Crawford Elder in three groups to the area. Two groups were ambushed on the nearby north-south thoroughfares, and the opposite side was not guarded because it was a riverbank. Another group, led by Detective Elder, rushed into the gate. At that time, the bandits had already robbed 60 silver dollars and 15 cents, and were about to leave with the loot when they encountered the detectives. The bandit Zheng took out a Mauser pistol and attempted to resist arrest. The detectives took preemptive action and opened fire with their pistols. For a time, the gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. Zheng was shot three times and fell to the ground. The Mauser pistol and 23 bullets were seized. Zhou died on the spot after being shot and was lying on his side in the owner's room. The bandit Jin Dasanzi was also shot several times and endured the pain to rush out of the gate with the bandit Zhang. Jin fell into the river in front due to his haste and died. The bandit Zhang was also arrested by Detective Shen. Another bandit, Jiang Chang'an, was arrested in the stove shed. In this battle, the two bandits Zhou and Jin were killed on the spot, and some of the original loot of 29 yuan and 75 cents was found near their bodies. The bandit Zheng was wounded by gunfire, and the two bandits Zhang and Jiang were captured alive. The deceased were carried to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road, and the wounded were taken to the hospital for treatment. Zhang and Jiang were taken to the patrol station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the criminal court of the First Special District Court. According to the lawyer of the patrol station, Wang Yaotang, who stated the above situation, the detective Li Baichuan also had a gunshot wound on his leg at the time. However, the patrol station has not yet investigated whether the bandits opened fire to resist arrest, so he requested a postponement. After Judge Wu Tingqi checked and reported, he briefly questioned the two defendants, Zhang and Jiang, and instructed them to be detained for a postponed hearing after investigation. Until about 10:00 AM, Inspector Guo Wei of the Special Court came to the scene to examine the corpses and took the public seat. According to Zhu Longhai, the owner of the house, who claimed to be from Pudong and was running a meat stall, he saw four bandits entering the room last night, one holding a pistol, and confining him and others in a room to carry out the robbery. He pointed out that the captured bandit Jiang Chang'an was indeed at the scene. Guo then issued an order that the two bandits Zhou San and Jin Dasanzi had been confirmed to have resisted arrest before their deaths and were shot and killed on the spot by the detectives. The pistol and 23 bullets were temporarily handed over to the patrol station for safekeeping, and the corpses were handed over to the Binshan Villa for collection.</p>
<p>[PCompardore Borrows Money in the Name of a Foreign Firm&gt;</p>
<p>Resigns on Pretext and Disregards the Debt</p>
<p>Sued by the Foreign Firm on Criminal Charges</p>
<p>Chen Yuru, a compradore from Suzhou who worked for the Jiali Foreign Firm at No. 105 Jiangxi Road, borrowed 14,000 taels from the China Industrial Bank between April 30th of last year, using the name of the firm. At the end of October, he resigned on a pretext and ignored the debt, secretly using the money for his own purposes. The bank reported this to the General Patrol Station, which sent Chinese detective Lai Yuanshan to No. 1659 Huajiangxi Road to arrest him. He was detained in the First Special District Court on charges of theft. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang opened the court for questioning. The plaintiff's lawyer presented the loan document for investigation and questioned the defendant. The defendant confessed that he had pledged the money on behalf of a customer and had not used it privately, and that he was now willing to settle it gradually. He also hired a lawyer to argue that this was a civil matter and requested to be released on bail to find a way to pay off the debt. The plaintiff's attorney stated that he did not object to bail and asked the court to set a reasonable amount. The defendant paid a surety of 14,000 taels and the hearing was postponed for further verification.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Discusses Postal Rate Issue</h3>
<p>Submitting a Written Inquiry to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Issue Was Also Discussed Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan discussed the postal rate increase proposal today. The Director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications attended the meeting to report that the increase was necessary for the safety and rapid development of the postal service. Last year's total revenue was 30 to 40 million, but due to the opening of the savings bureau and the impact of the flood, there was a loss of 4 million. It is estimated that the price increase will increase revenue by 10 to 20 million next year. Wei Haosheng said that if the Ministry of Communications increased postal rates for the purpose of building houses and opening savings bureaus, it would be inappropriate. Wang Yongbin said that regardless of whether the price increase issue was reasonable, the Ministry of Communications had violated government orders. On September 1 of last year, the National Government clearly ordered that the central and local governments should first obtain the decision of the Central Political Conference and the review of the Legislative Yuan for the principle of compulsory collection from the people and the granting of special interests such as various exclusive purchases, monopolies, and franchises before they could be established. Since this case has not been discussed by the Central Political Conference or reviewed by this Yuan, the Executive Yuan has no right to independently decide the date of implementation. In addition, the general budget for the 20th year of the Republic has been clearly announced. As a result, Chen Changheng drafted a written inquiry to be sent to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Communications to immediately stop implementation. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 183rd meeting at 8:00 AM on the 30th. The attending committee members were Zhu Hezhong, the 30th person, and the chairman was Acting President Qin Zhen. The discussion items are as follows: (1) The Legal System Committee of this Yuan reported on the interpretation of the term "net profit" in the Regulations on the Supervision of Private Public Utilities and the limit of public reserve fund deposits. It was resolved to pass the review report. (2) Committee members Cai Xuan, Chen Zhaoying, Zhuang Songfu, Ma Yinchu, and Lin Bin of this Yuan reported on the review of the draft organizational charter of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Regional Fisheries Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry. It was resolved to return it to the original reviewers and committee members Wei Tingsheng, Feng Zhaoyi, Zhu Heping, Zhou Wei, and Zhang Mojun for review. (3) Review the Budget Law. It was resolved to refer it to the Finance Committee and committee members Luo Ding, Shi Shangkuan, Liu Kejuan, Wang Shiwei, Zhao Chaojun, Cai Xuan, Shi Weihuan, Cheng Zhonghang, and Zhu Hezhong for review. (4) Committee members Zhang Zhihan and others of this Yuan temporarily proposed that the increase in postal rates would increase the burden on the people and violate legal procedures, and should consult the Executive Yuan to submit the case to this Yuan for review. It was resolved to submit an inquiry to the Executive Yuan and request that the case be submitted to this Yuan for review. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch) (Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan announced this morning that the increase in inland postal rates was illegal. The Yuan convened a meeting in the morning and resolved that the decision of the Ministry of Communications to increase postal rates was not in accordance with the law. It requested that the National Government immediately issue an order to stop its implementation, because the matter had never been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review, and the National Government's budget had been passed and promulgated, and the price increase of postal rates was not included in the case, so it was difficult to implement it. The Legislative Yuan also discussed the new plan of the British minister, and several committee members expressed their indignation. It was resolved that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should strictly abide by the resolutions passed by the Special Committee of the Nineteen Powers and reject the new plan. However, this move will not affect China's acceptance of the plan, as the final decision-making power rests with the National Government. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Two Railway Bridges Between Harbin and Hengdaohezi are Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The situation in the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is deteriorating. Two railway bridges between Harbin and Hengdaohezi have been completely destroyed, causing traffic to be cut off again. It is said that this was done by the anti-Manchukuo army. The railway bureau sent two repair cars from Yimianpo and Hengdaohezi to the scene to repair, but they were attacked en route and had to return. The destroyed railway bridges are currently difficult to repair, so trains only reach Yimianpo, which is 90 miles from Harbin. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[PShitouhezi Station Attacked&gt;</p>
<p>(Harbin) The anti-Manchukuo army recently attacked the Shitouhezi station again. The stationmaster was captured. Ma Zhanshan's troops are also very active and are now stationed in sections not far from Fujia Dian. When Ma revolted, the army did not change its position. It was only yesterday that it announced its resistance to the Manchukuo government, detaining all the vehicles in the Fujia Dian station and sending them to Hailun. The Japanese army has been dispatched to the Fujia Dian area, but due to the lack of vehicles, there is currently no way to pursue them. Recently, the Japanese army stationed outside Fujia Dian obtained an armored train in Hailin. There are two corpses in the car, the Russian driver Shijiejin and the Russian guard Gomen, both of whom were bound and shot dead. It is said that the Russian road police between Yimianpo and Hengdaohezi were all detained when the anti-Manchukuo army retreated. Their fate is currently unknown. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[PMa Zhanshan Declares That He Never Signed a Treaty with Japan</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Had Pressured Him to Sign a Treaty</p>
<p>He Resolutely Refused and Has Not Signed It</p>
<p>Heihe Ma Zhanshan telegraphed, "All newspaper offices are informed, the Japanese aggression in the Northeast, cunning conspiracy, have emerged repeatedly. The most cruel thing is to force signatures on unilaterally drafted treaties and contracts, which is a habitual trick. When I was in the province, the Japanese side held their proposed loan contracts for the Qiqihar-Huhuai Railway and aviation treaties, etc., and forced me to co-sign them, using all means of enticement and coercion. I refused them all and have not signed them. Recently, I heard that the Japanese side signed it with Ding Jianxiu, the Minister of Transportation of the puppet state. After investigating the fact that Zhanshan had been falsely commissioned by the Japanese for more than 40 days, although he was within the sphere of influence of the Japanese, he never signed any treaties. I have asked myself, and I can face the country and the people. Since leaving the province on April 2, I have worked hard to resist Japan, and there has been no signing of treaties. The people of the country should be able to understand this. I am only worried that the Japanese will falsely use my name, or coerce other officials remaining in the province, to sign a contract. Therefore, I hereby declare that Heilongjiang has never signed a treaty with Japan. Any contract that is forged in the name of Zhanshan, or signed by anyone, will not be recognized and will be invalid. I hope this will be known to the public." Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, respectfully printed, (30th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Team Members are Under Severe Surveillance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a visitor from Shenyang, the Japanese side is doing everything possible to hinder the actions of the Chinese delegation participating in the League of Nations Investigation Team in Shenyang, making it impossible for them to be free. Detectives are densely stationed where the delegation is located, which is extremely bizarre. There are often six or seven people on duty outside Representative Gu's residence. Even when he goes to the dining room or other rooms, they must follow him. Not to mention going out for a walk. Staff members are also under severe surveillance. Their bedrooms are sometimes invaded and their conversations are sometimes interfered with. Many visitors are prevented from visiting, and some have even been arrested because of this. One night, a stenographer of the delegation was returning to his room when he found a Japanese person already in the room. He ran out of the room, but there were also several people standing outside the door. The stenographer called out loudly, and a committee member arrived at the scene, and the Japanese people all fled. It is inferred that the intention may have been to steal important documents. Currently, all members of the investigation team are also unable to avoid surveillance. This is completely contrary to the League of Nations' resolution that both governments should provide all kinds of facilities. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>300,000 Hubei Province Flood Victims Starving</h3>
<p>Relief Association Telegraphes Various Groups for Assistance</p>
<p>(Hankou) The flood relief association has exhausted its relief funds and food supplies. If assistance is not received, 300,000 flood victims in the province will have nothing to eat in one or two weeks. The situation is extremely serious. The Hubei Relief Association sent an urgent telegram yesterday to various groups, requesting immediate assistance. The National General Relief Association replied that the funds have been exhausted and they are unable to help. The provincial government also replied that the provincial funds are severely depleted and they cannot respond to the request. Therefore, the future of the 300,000 flood victims is a cause for great concern. Most of them are gathered along the riverbank and have not been able to return to their homes because the communists have disrupted their villages. However, if they are not provided for, these 300,000 flood victims may be driven by hunger to join the communist movement. According to the person in charge of the relief association, the government troops are currently engaged in communist suppression operations elsewhere, and the military strength in Wuhan is very thin. If the 300,000 flood victims take desperate measures due to the interruption of relief efforts, the future will be unimaginable. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<h3>Disarmament Conference Runs Aground</h3>
<p>Political Problems Remain Unresolved</p>
<p>Technical Discussions are Futile</p>
<p>Talks Among Five Major Powers Scheduled to Resume Within Two Weeks</p>
<p>Debate Between Germany and France Over Pocket Battleship Issue</p>
<p>Brüning Departs for Berlin</p>
<p>Geneva, April 29 (National News Agency) It was announced here tonight that the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference will not reconvene until the major powers have reached some concrete agreement on certain political issues. This news was released during a conversation between the French representative, Mr. Paul-Boncour, and representatives of the French press. However, Mr. Paul-Boncour still stated that the specialized committees are not adjourning. The chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Mr. Henderson, also issued a similar statement after today's closed-door meeting of the Steering Committee, declaring that the General Commission will not reconvene for the time being, but that everything else will continue as usual without any changes. He also stated that no motion for the complete adjournment of the Disarmament Conference has been proposed. However, it is reliably learned that the complete adjournment of the Disarmament Conference has already been secretly considered by key figures in the conference. Mr. Stimson and Mr. MacDonald both support this move, believing that technical discussions are futile when there is no hope of agreement on political issues. Furthermore, all parties here tonight acknowledge that the Disarmament Conference has run aground because the politicians of the major powers have failed to reach an agreement on political issues. The reason why the major powers have failed to reach an agreement is that Tardieu is unwilling to come to Geneva to allow Britain and America to arbitrate the dispute between France and Germany. If it were not for Mr. Henderson's vigorous opposition to adjournment, the Disarmament Conference might have closed today. However, given the current situation, it is believed that the complete adjournment of the conference is only a matter of time. Whether the conference can avert disaster in the future depends entirely on the resumption of talks among the five major powers. According to British sources, the French government has expressed its willingness to continue the Geneva talks after May 15. Mr. Paul-Boncour's conversation also indicated that talks among the representatives of the five major powers are unlikely to resume before May 12. If this is the case, then it is expected that the Disarmament Conference will have to be postponed until the beginning of June before there is hope of reconvening. One thing is now certain: when the five major powers reopen talks in the future, the US Secretary of State will not be able to participate. Mr. Gibson will represent the United States at that time. According to a member of the US delegation, Mr. Gibson is also very capable of carrying out the United States' proposals. Mr. Stimson will go to an Italian port to take the next mail ship back to the United States. Mr. Stimson originally intended to travel through a French port, but because Mr. Tardieu is unwilling to come to Geneva, Mr. Stimson is also unwilling to go to Paris, and has therefore changed his route through Italy. Therefore, it is recognized here that this matter is tit-for-tat and worthy of investigation.</p>
<p>Geneva, April 29 (National News Agency) After consultations with key figures such as British Prime Minister MacDonald and US Secretary of State Stimson today, it was decided that the disarmament talks among the five major powers would resume within two weeks.</p>
<p>Geneva, April 29 (National News Agency) In today's meeting of the Naval Committee of the Disarmament Conference, the German and French representatives again engaged in a heated debate over pocket battleships. The French representative pointed to the German pocket battleship Deutschland as the most dangerous weapon in the world and argued that it should be abolished. The German representative stood up to refute this, calling it an excellent model of a defensive weapon. He said that if other countries could imitate it, it would save a lot of military spending. As for the fact that its firepower is huge and its armor is thin, this is because the Treaty of Versailles limited Germany to building ships of no more than 10,000 tons, so it had to increase firepower and speed.</p>
<p>Geneva, April 29 (Reuters) At today's meeting of the Naval Committee of the Disarmament Conference, the German representative, Mr. Rheinbaben, said, "The construction cost of a 'pocket battleship' is about half that of a capital ship, but if all countries are willing to reduce the total tonnage of capital ships, then Germany will not hesitate to sacrifice its 'pocket battleship.'" The German representative also said that capital ships are often used to blockade seaports, and therefore indirectly have an offensive function. This function increases or decreases depending on the tonnage. The Japanese representative said that the nature of all combat items should be determined by their use. Capital ships are an important part of the navy, but if they are used to attack the other side, they must rely on other warships to be used at the same time. The US representative, Mr. Swanson, stated that the United States has the responsibility to protect the safety of the Panama Canal and that capital ships are a major element of the US Navy. If they are abolished, then the US defense must be completely reorganized. The British representative, Rear Admiral Pound, said that he agreed with the US representative's opinion that capital ships are only defensive in nature. The British representative also said that he doubts whether capital ships can destroy land-based forts.</p>
<p>Geneva, April 29 (National News Agency) After a final long talk with US Secretary of State Stimson and British Prime Minister MacDonald, German Chancellor Brüning departed for Berlin today. The German Ambassador to France, Mr. Hoesch, came to Geneva to report on a certain issue to the Chancellor and also traveled with him. However, after arriving in Basel, Mr. Hoesch will change trains and return to Paris.</p>
<p>French General Election, First Round of Voting Today</p>
<p>Paris, April 20 (Reuters) Tomorrow is the date for the French Chamber of Deputies election. There are 3,617 candidates for the 615 seats in the Chamber. This is widely regarded as the most important election since the European War. It is anticipated that there will not be major changes among the four major parties, as all parties, with the exception of the Social Revolutionary Party and the extreme conservative party, have largely converged on the main lines of domestic and international policy. If there are changes, it is likely that the Central Party and the Radical Party will gain the position of the extreme source. As there are five or six candidates competing for each seat, a candidate must win an absolute majority of the votes to win. It is expected that at most two or three hundred people will be elected in the first round of voting. The remainder will be elected in the second round of voting on May 8, at which time the parties will negotiate to reduce the number of candidates. The current number of seats held by the four major parties in the Chamber is as follows: National Party 85 seats, Central Group 235 seats, Radical Party 109 seats, Social Party 111 seats. This election campaign has proceeded very quietly, almost unprecedented in French political history, which proves that the constituencies are all aware of the importance of their responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Soviet Land Minister Reaffirms Maintaining Peace</h3>
<p>Determined to Resist Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>Moscow, April 30 (National News Agency) Soviet People's Commissar for Military Affairs, Voroshilov, issued a May 1st proclamation to the Red Army, reaffirming the Soviet Union's desire to maintain peace, but stated that while the Soviet Union is determined to maintain peace, it is also equally determined to do its utmost to resist any attempt to invade its territory, undermine it, or destroy its revolution.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Turkish Friendship, Joint Anti-Imperialist Struggle</h3>
<p>Molotov Hosts Banquet for Turkish Prime Minister</p>
<p>Moscow, April 29 (TASS) Tonight, Soviet People's Committee Chairman Molotov hosted a banquet for the Turkish Prime Minister and other key figures of the Turkish government at the Kremlin. During the banquet, Molotov first delivered a welcoming speech, expressing the importance of Soviet-Turkish friendship, stating that the current international conflicts should forge the friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and that this friendship is further strengthened because the people of the Soviet Union and Turkey are both engaged in the struggle against imperialism to seek their national independence, the right to survive, and to reconstruct their countries. The cooperation between the two countries for the past twelve years has not been slackened in the slightest. Soviet-Turkish cooperation has created a new model in international politics, as the non-aggression treaty signed by the Soviet Union with foreign countries, starting with the 1925 Soviet-Turkish non-aggression treaty, was a pioneering agreement. Turkish Prime Minister Ismet then rose to deliver a reply speech, expressing his heartfelt gratitude for the warm welcome from all sectors of Soviet society. At the same time, he said that he had long admired the Soviet Union's amazing construction, so he wanted to come and visit, as well as to strengthen the close friendship between the two countries. This trip reminded him of the Soviet-Turkish treaty established after a long struggle in 1925, which was signed only after Litvinov and Karakhan traveled to Ankara. In conclusion, the Turkish Prime Minister said that the Soviet Union and Turkey seek the mutual interests of the two countries in close friendship, which represents not only a satisfactory combination in the international community, but also a cornerstone of international peace.</p>
<p>Riga, April 29 (Havas) The Soviet press, because of the invitation of the Turkish delegation to Russia, declared that Soviet Russia already has a partner in the East and is no longer as isolated as before. It is rumored in Moscow that there is a plan for Eastern solidarity, which seems to have originated from Karakhan, the former ambassador to Beijing and now the deputy commissioner for People's Foreign Affairs. This rumor, combined with the remarks of Losovsky, secretary of the International Red Labor Union, is quite meaningful. Losovsky, at the ongoing Trade Union Congress in Moscow, said that a Far Eastern war has already begun, that the Soviet border has been threatened, and therefore the issue of mobilizing all trade union members should be put on the agenda. In addition, Aimeng, chairman of the Aviation and Chemical Development Association, also stated at the Trade Union Congress that an inevitable war is imminent, and that each trade union is purely a military organization.</p>
<h3>Today is Labor Day: Soviet Russia Holds a Grand Celebration</h3>
<p>The Purpose is to Promote Preparedness for National Defense</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency, Moscow, 30th) This Labor Day, the Soviet Russia will hold an unprecedented grand celebration throughout the country. Its true purpose is to promote preparedness for national defense. The displays in all the shops' windows and the decorations in the streets of Moscow all contain the meaning of preparedness for national defense. Tomorrow's official announcement will also solemnly declare the urgency of war and the importance of military training for the people.</p>
<p>[P International Labor Conference Decides on Minimum Age for Child Labor</p>
<p>(Reuters, Geneva, 29th) The International Labor Conference today discussed the age of child labor in non-industrial positions, and decided that the minimum age in India should not be less than ten years old, and in other countries, the minimum age should not be less than fourteen years old. During today's debate, representatives compared the labor conditions of various countries and said that the labor situation in India is not as good as in Japan.</p>
<p>[P Bizarre Overseas Rumors: Serbian Aviator Joins the Anti-Japanese War</p>
<p>(Havas, Yugoslavia, 29th) A newspaper in the capital of Albania received news from Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, stating that during the battles between China and Japan near Shanghai, a Chinese pilot named Li Fuyan (transliteration) shot down many Japanese planes, becoming a household name. London newspapers have repeatedly published reports about Mr. Li's great deeds. However, it is now known that Mr. Li is not Chinese, but a Yugoslavian named Bani Shang, whose first name is Kresimi. A friend of Bani Shang's, who is a pilot in the First Aviation Pursuit Team in Novi Sad, happened to see a photo of Mr. Li in the newspaper and confirmed that it was Bani Shang. Yesterday, reporters went to the residence of Bani Shang's mother in Petrovaradin. They were told that her son was born in Virovitica in 1891, and served as a court official there. Later, he was involved in a dishonorable incident, and left Yugoslavia. There was no news until 1922, when his mother received a letter stating that Mr. Bani Shang was serving in the Japanese Army Air Force. No one knows how Mr. Bani Shang was able to leave the Japanese army and join the Chinese air force.</p>
<h3>South Irish Patriotic Association Passes Second Reading of Oath Abolition Bill</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 29th) The Free State Abolition of Oath Bill passed its second reading in Parliament today with 77 votes against 71 votes. Former government leader Cosgrave said that de Valera had previously created Anglo-Irish infighting with foolish arrogance, and now wants to create an atmosphere of war in the Free State. De Valera replied that the abolition of the oath does not undermine the Anglo-Irish Treaty. There is no need for negotiation on this matter. Whether the equality of all countries within the British Empire is just empty talk will be tested here. What we are doing does not exceed the scope of what we can do. If the British government wants to take retaliatory action, it will only prove that what it calls equality is all hypocrisy.</p>

<p>[P Japanese Side Mass Arrests Russians in Harbin</p>
<p>Soviet Government Orders Business Community to Leave Harbin</p>
<p>Active Participation of the Soviet Railway Workers' Union</p>
<p>The Righteous Army of the Harbin-Suifenhe Line Launches a Large-Scale Alliance</p>
<p>(Harbin Correspondence) After the incident where a Japanese troop train was bombed at Cheng Gaozi Station on the Harbin-Suifenhe Line of the Eastern Railway a few days ago, the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters immediately sent many detectives to Harbin to arrest the Soviet railway workers. As of today (the 22nd), more than 230 people have been arrested and are being secretly investigated at the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. Gao Changchun, the leader of the Detective Team of the Railway Police Department, was also arrested by the Japanese soldiers and severely tortured. He was accused of being the mastermind of the case. However, Gao did not confess despite being tortured until his body was covered in wounds. Therefore, the Japanese military's search and arrest operations are still ongoing. All members of the Soviet business and industrial communities in Northeast China who do not have important jobs have been ordered to return to their country. All commercial organizations and state-owned trading companies have been ordered to close down and are scheduled to be liquidated within a month. The houses and properties will be taken care of by German consuls and German expatriates. The Soviet railway workers who are serving in the military also received a secret order from the Russian consulate the day before yesterday, instructing them to return to Vladivostok or Khabarovsk early to report to the Military Branch of the Political Bureau. The Soviet Railway Workers' Union has secretly formed a youth army, which has been secretly transporting ammunition and weapons from Russia to the east and hiding them in railway clubs along various stations. The army is divided into three shifts and is secretly deployed along the Harbin-Changchun, Harbin-Manzhouli, and Harbin-Suifenhe lines to carry out sabotage of transportation and railway buildings. There are rumors that the Russian Red Workers will hold a large-scale strike and riot within the May 1st holiday. Recently, slogans and leaflets opposing Japanese imperialism and supporting the Soviet Union have been posted all over Harbin. The Japanese side is naturally panicked about this. In addition to the Kwantung Army Headquarters urgently telegraphing the Ministry of the Army to request reinforcements, it also instructed Wang Ruihua, the director of the Special Police Department, to search the Soviet Workers' Union and the Russian Consulate in Harbin, hoping to uncover the headquarters of the Red Russians. Wang Ruihua refused to do it immediately. The Japanese side then forced the puppet government to summon Wang to Changchun, where he was reprimanded by the puppet Prime Minister and ordered to do it immediately. Wang returned to Harbin a few days ago and is currently planning how to proceed, as he fears that carelessness will easily cause changes. White Russian technical personnel in Harbin have been almost completely rounded up by the Japanese army in recent days, and they are planning to use them to replace Soviet railway employees when they strike. The White Russians are very active, and it is said that 6,000 of them have secretly formed a volunteer army. The Japanese side is supplying them with guns and ammunition. The headquarters is in Harbin, and the army is secretly deployed in Mianpo, Wujimi, Boketu, and Taolai Zhao along the Eastern Railway. The Japanese side will use them as vanguards for attacking Soviet Russia. The Russian authorities in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk have been propagating news of a Sino-Japanese war and Japanese troops approaching the Russian border for the past week, broadcasting it via radio every night, and the attitude is very active. Foreigners in Harbin generally see the inevitability of a Sino-Japanese war as clear as day, so more and more people are moving to the interior or seeking safe areas to avoid disaster. The Chinese people, on the other hand, feel that even if they sacrifice temporarily and suffer the ravages of the international communist army, they would rather not see their land fall and become slaves under the iron hooves of the empire forever. Therefore, they all hope that the Sino-Japanese war will start soon.</p>
<p>Currently, the National Salvation Army of the Harbin-Suifenhe Line is cooperating with Li Du and Ding Chao's Self-Defense Army and reorganizing into the National Salvation Army, with Wang Delin as the commander-in-chief, Ben Du as his deputy, and Feng Zhanhai as the chief of staff. Li's troops are currently being transported to the Harbin-Suifenhe Line, planning to form a triangular front. On the evening of the 21st, Liu Zhenbang's Second Route National Salvation Army advanced to Dongshahe. Xi Qia's troops retreated near Mianpo. Traffic between Dongshahe and Mianpo has been cut off, and Harbin-Suifenhe passenger and freight trains have been cut off. The Japanese Murai Brigade stationed in Mianpo is in contact with the National Salvation Army. The fighting was fierce on the evening of the 21st. On the morning of the 22nd, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses due to the fierce attack of the National Salvation Army. Japanese expatriates in Mianpo and Dongshahe have all withdrawn to Harbin. The fighting is still going on. The newly arrived Japanese Hirose Division in Harbin, two infantry regiments and one artillery regiment, had already left for reinforcements on the 21st, and a total of three regiments of field artillery and infantry advanced to Wujimi, planning to transfer to Yanshou to attack Yilan. At the same time, the river ice has thawed, and they are planning to transport troops by naval ships to attack by water, coordinating with the land route. The Japanese army believes that the united old Jilin army is a force that cannot be insulted, so they are eager to strike first. Yesterday, it was heard that Dunhua County, Jidun Road, was besieged by Wang Delin's Big Sword Brigade, and Nong'an County was besieged by Li Qingshan's National Salvation Volunteer Army, both of which were very urgent. The Japanese side specially dispatched a large force to attack. At the time when the League of Nations Investigation Team is entering the country, the voices of anti-Japanese resistance are rising, which is enough to prove that the people of Northeast China have never been willing to be slaves of a fallen country. (April 22nd) [P The Japanese Government Believes the League of Nations is Harmful and Useless</p>
<p>Eager to Withdraw and Reconsider Countermeasures</p>
<p>(Kobe Shimbun) The relationship between the Committee of Nineteen and our country is becoming more and more unfavorable. Fundamentally, we are standing on opposing sides, so there is no room for compromise. From an international perspective, it is better for Japan, which is currently joining the League of Nations that is harmful and useless, to withdraw as soon as possible. Initially, the argument for withdrawal came only from the military, but now it is gradually becoming a policy within the government. The reasons are: (1) The Japanese government does not recognize the Committee of Nineteen's legitimacy, so its resolutions cannot bind Japan. (2) If Japan does not recognize its resolutions, the Committee will further use the powers granted to it and, according to Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Covenant, adopt other measures to suppress Japan when disputes cannot be resolved. (3) The Committee of Nineteen argues that if Japan is not bound by the resolutions, it is necessary to request a judgment from the International Court of Justice or the Legal Committee. (4) Regarding the resolution of the General Assembly on March 11, the Japanese government opposed it by reserving the right to abstain, arguing that the resolution has no binding force, but other countries do not recognize Japan's attitude. They will insist that the March 10 resolution is valid. If this is the case, Japan's opinion and the League of Nations' claim are incompatible, and future disputes are inevitable. Therefore, Japan's presence in the League of Nations is not a good strategy. (5) If the organization of the League of Nations does not change its current state, Japan's resistance to the League of Nations will never end. In addition, this time, in order to protect their own security, the small countries want to deal with the abstract issue of a security guarantee formula in a realistic way. In the future, they will inevitably use the same means against Japan. As a result, Japan's presence in the League of Nations is harmful and useless. (6) Many of our people are worried that if the Shanghai issue is not resolved quickly, the Manchurian issue will also be in a disadvantageous position. However, our government believes that if the Shanghai issue is not resolved favorably, the Manchurian issue will suffer the same unfavorable result. Therefore, if we surrender to the demands of the Committee of Nineteen on the ceasefire issue, and on the one hand disregard the Committee of Nineteen's claims on the grounds that we are not bound by the resolutions, it is an even more unprincipled opinion that will leave future troubles. They will inevitably persecute Japan, and Japan will suffer endless harm. In view of the above reasons, Japan should clearly express its intention to withdraw from the League of Nations at this critical moment and reconsider future countermeasures.</p>
<h3>London Diplomatic Circles Observe Sino-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>British Newspapers' Arguments Are Unfavorable to Japan</p>
<p>(Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, London Special Correspondent Nan Shan) London has recently been hearing that the situation between Japan and Russia is tense, and diplomatic circles recognize it as a major issue. However, according to those who understand the situation in both countries, the following three points can be included: (1) Some people believe that Japan, influenced by Redization, will provoke a war against Russia. Although Japan cannot wipe out the Communist Party in one fell swoop, it can give a painful blow to Redization. (2) Some people believe that Japan has ambitions in the Russian coastal region, so it is challenging Russia. (3) In the past two or three months, there have been frequent exchanges of telegrams between Moscow and Washington, the contents of which are entirely about the Manchurian issue. Russia and the United States seem to have reached a tacit agreement, so Russia's recent attitude has been tough and unwilling to shy away from war with Japan. It is also said that Japan may unite with Russia and the United States in a war. Although there are the above three observations in London diplomatic circles, the British officialdom is quite calm and has not expressed any clear stance. However, several newspapers in the journalistic community have recklessly criticized Japan, and their arguments are very unfavorable to Japan.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Advises Puyi to Take Care of Himself</h3>
<p>The Only Way to Survive is to Seek Assistance from the Investigation Team</p>
<p>Sacrificing Therefore is Better Than Inaction</p>
<p>(Beijing Correspondence) After Ma Zhanshan arrived in Heihe from Longsha, he announced that he would continue to resist Japan. On the 25th, Ma sent a telegram to Puyi and Zheng Xiaoxu, advising them to take good care of themselves. The original telegram read: "To Puyi, Long Live the Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Changchun. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, Zhanshan has been serving in the army and has no chance to meet you. Now that the Japanese are causing trouble, you have been used by the Japanese as a rare commodity in retirement. When I visited you before the restoration, I was honored to receive your kind words and hear your innermost thoughts. I am grateful and do not know how to repay you. After returning to the Jiang, I recalled what I saw and heard in Changchun. I am sure that the Japanese are using you as a puppet to achieve their ambition of carving up the Northeast and making it a continuation of Korea. Although they have repeatedly stated that there is no infringement of territorial sovereignty, Zhang Yanqing and Xie Jieshi have also repeatedly said that the Japanese are determined to be trustworthy. However, at the meeting, Komai severely criticized Xi Qia for the issue of Japanese nationals, and because the investigation team is about to come to the east, they are deeply afraid that the establishment of the Manchu state will be detected by the international community. Therefore, they are deceiving the world under the guise of the self-determination of the people of Northeast China. If we continue to delay like this, after the investigation team leaves, right and wrong will have been reversed, and there will be no hope of restoring the Northeast. Once the National Government sends troops to suppress them, you will not only be a criminal of the Republic of China, but also heavily burden the Republic of China's spirit of the world being for the public. Even if the National Government abandons the Northeast, you will be a piece of meat on the chopping board and a fish in a pot. In a few years, the Japanese will inevitably use their old tricks of annexing Korea. I am deeply afraid that the Qing Dynasty's three hundred years of deep benevolence and kindness will be constantly sent to the hands of the National Revolution and be cut off under the iron hooves of the Japanese. This is what Zhanshan is worried about, and I dare not fail to speak frankly to you. For the sake of the present, the only way to survive is to wait for the investigation team to arrive in Changchun, and when you meet them, to describe in detail how the Japanese are oppressing you and how the organization of the government is not of your own volition. On the one hand, request the team to protect you and allow you to leave the country. If so, the Japanese will not dare to harm you under international surveillance. In the future, when China is restored, you will surely be supported by the people and become the head of the Republic of China again. Even if it is not easy to escape from the tiger's mouth and you sacrifice yourself, your heroic name will be praised by future generations for thousands of years, which cannot be compared to being trapped in a cage and doing nothing. Now that Zhanshan is taking advantage of the fact that the investigation team is about to arrive, under the pretext of investigating the defense, I am personally going to Heihe to reorganize the army and prepare for the recovery of lost territory. On the one hand, I will inform the world and show the truth about the Japanese, so that their devilish tricks have nowhere to hide. I will do my best to resist their violence and swear to fight them to the end. Even if I unfortunately lose, I will never let go of a single soldier to repay you and the entire nation. I think you are naturally intelligent and will surely have a good way to handle it. I am sending this telegram with great anxiety and anticipation. Ma Zhanshan bows respectfully. (Ma's telegram to Zheng Xiaoxu has roughly the same meaning as the telegram to Puyi)"</p>
<h3>Guangdong Army Recovers Chongyi in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) After the Guangdong Army's Yu Hanmou troops entered southern Jiangxi, the bandits who were originally based in Ganzhou and Yuxin moved to avoid the heavy and take the light. Except for Lin Biao's pseudo-Fourth Army, He Binghui's pseudo-Twelfth Army, and Zhao Bosheng's (Sun Lianzhong's rebel soldiers) pseudo-New Fifth Army entering Fujian from Ruijin and Shicheng, Li Mingrui's pseudo-Seventh Army and Peng Dehuai's pseudo-Third Army Corps, on the one hand, fled west from Ganxian to Chongyi and Shangyou, echoing the bandits in eastern Hunan and Guixi, and on the other hand, entered Suichuan from Wan'an, contacting the scattered bandits in Yongxin and Ninggang to return to their old nests in Jinggangshan. The remaining bandits, such as Gu Daozhong, Wu Zhonghao, and Yang Yuebin, are still lurking in the areas of Gulonggang, Gaoxingxu, Wangbi, Dongshao, and Ganzhu, hoping to disperse the targets of the National Army. However, on the Guangdong Army side, Li's division in the middle has advanced to Ganzhou, and Zhang and Ye's divisions on the left have concentrated in Xinfeng and are advancing towards Xingguo and Yudu. According to news from Ganzhou, Ye's division has been attacking the bandit nests in Dawolong and Hui Chang'anbao for several days, killing 400 to 500 bandits and surrendering more than 1,000. The surrender of the rebel soldiers of Sun's unit in the pseudo-Fifth Army is also very enthusiastic. Li's division also attacked and washed away the 9th Division of the pseudo-Second Army at Yangmeisi, the boundary between Nankang and Chongyi, a few days ago, and the remaining Red bandits retreated to Shangyou, and captured the county seat of Chongyi. Yu Hanmou received the news and ordered Fan Dexing's troops to rush to suppress them overnight. According to military reports, Fan's brigade completely defeated the Red bandit Peng Dehuai's troops occupying the county seat of Chongyi in the morning. At 3:00 p.m. on the same day, the remaining bandits in Ke County fled towards Guopingba and Dongfang. Our army is still tracking and pursuing them.</p>

<h3>The Tragic Death of Lu San in the Lawsuit for Being Wrongfully Accused of Kidnapping After Being Sued for Debt</h3>
<p>Lu Yin Seeks Justice for Her Husband</p>
<p>Detective Zhou is Accused of Murdering Him</p>
<p>Zhou Vehemently Denies Everything</p>
<p>The Nurse Also Testifies in Court</p>
<p>Zhou Honglin, a detective from the General Investigation Office of the General Police Department, together with Detective Chief Lu Liankui and others, took the wanted criminal Chen Sanwenzi in three cars to investigate the kidnappers on Ximen Road in the French Concession on September 28 last year. After passing the west side of the Great World, a person in a rickshaw came face to face. According to the report of the informant who went with them, the person in the rickshaw was the kidnapper Lu San, also known as Lu Qingcai, so they got out of the car and arrested Lu. Unexpectedly, Lu suddenly fell ill a few days later. The police department sent him to the hospital for treatment, but he died. Afterwards, his wife Lu Yin filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Local Court through a lawyer, accusing Zhou Honglin of murdering her husband. It has been tried several times and has been reported in previous newspapers. The court opened again yesterday, but the presiding judge has been replaced by Judge Qian Hongye, so it must be retried. The defendant, Zhou Honglin, hired lawyers Fan Gang and others to defend him. Judge Qian immediately ordered the plaintiff Lu Yin to state the intent of the prosecution. According to her statement, the defendant Zhou Honglin had borrowed 1,000 yuan from her husband in the past and had a written note. When the agreed date arrived, he did not repay the debt. On August 17th of the lunar calendar last year, her husband took the note and went to Zhou to demand payment, and was arrested and accused of being a kidnapper. When her husband was in the hospital, she went to visit him. At that time, he whispered to her that he had been injured by Zhou, and told her to seek justice for him. At that time, no one in the hospital heard him, only Lu Su, who went with her, heard him. Chen Zhu had also witnessed her husband being tortured in the police station. Zhou Honglin, the defendant, stated that Lu Qingcai was arrested by Deputy Detective Tang Jian. Tang Jian searched him on the spot and then transferred him to the Laozha Police Station for detention. Although the case was handled by me, I never independently conducted an investigation of Lu. Since I have been serving in the police station, I have done my best to catch thieves. This time, I have been maliciously accused and intend to retaliate, so the plaintiff's statement is mostly castles in the air and cannot be believed, and so on. Then, Chen Sanwenzi was brought up to testify. Deputy Detective Tang also reported the circumstances of Lu San's arrest, stating that after Lu was taken into the car, the informant confirmed that he was the right person. The nurse, surnamed Lu, was also summoned to the case. According to her statement, Lu Qingcai was very ill at the time, and when he saw his wife, he shook his head frequently, as if refusing people to come near, and she did not see the two parties talking. Judge Qian announced that he would wait for a scheduled debate because the witnesses had already been examined.</p>
<h3>Xu Qingyun's Posthumous Lawsuit for Encroachment on Inheritance</h3>
<p>Married Daughter Accuses Her Brother</p>
<p>Her Husband Represents Her in Court</p>
<p>Xu Qingyun Forbade Lawsuits Before His Death</p>
<p>Still Inevitably Meet in Court</p>
<p>—A Dispute Between More Than 10 Million and More Than 1 Million—</p>
<p>Fang Xu Meiying, the daughter-in-law of Ningbo businessman Fang Jiyang, and the daughter of the late comprador of the British Bank, Xu Qingyun, hired a lawyer last winter to file a criminal lawsuit in the Second Special District Local Court against her elder brother Xu Maotang for encroaching on the inheritance. The court ordered an accountant to check the accounts and re-verify the case. It has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, she was summoned again, and Judge Cao Jun opened the court for trial. The plaintiff, Xu Meiying, was represented by her husband, Fang Wenbo, who stated that his wife was ill, so she did not appear in court. Then, the lawyer Qin Liankui stood up and stated the case, stating that the plaintiff's father actually had an inheritance of more than 10 million yuan during his lifetime. After his death, the defendant suddenly claimed that there was only an inheritance of more than 1.5 million yuan. After deducting the costs of funeral and debts, there was little left, which was a huge difference. Last time, the court ordered an audit, but the accountant only extracted a few account books. It should be requested that the court order the defendant to hand over the remaining account books so that the accountant can investigate in detail. Xu Maotang, the defendant, stated that his father's inheritance was actually only 1.56 million. When he made his will, his mother, younger siblings, and others were all present. All the inheritance was managed by his father alone during his lifetime. After his death, his mother held the key to the silver box, so he did not know how much property there was. As for whether there were other account books, the merchant did not know. Then, accountant Xie Lin stated that after being ordered to investigate the accounts of Xu's inheritance, his accountant received 79 account books from the first year of the Republic of China to the 20th year, and a general account book of accumulating gold and jade from the 33rd year of Guangxu to the 19th year of the Republic of China. This general account book was personally recorded by Mr. Xu himself at the end of each year. His accountant believed that Mr. Xu's account books were complete and without any defects. The plaintiff could not force Maotang to hand over other account books. If the plaintiff had any doubts, she could present evidence. At this point, Maotang also stated that on the day before his father died, that is, on the evening of November 10 last year, his younger sister, Meiying, the plaintiff, cried loudly in front of her father, saying, "What will I do after you are gone?" At that time, his father comforted her, saying, "People say that I have tens of millions of assets, but in fact I only have one or two million. Don't listen to other people's words, or get involved in lawsuits," and so on. At that time, the merchant's mother and elder sister were all present and heard it, which could be proved. Finally, after a long debate by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Cao announced the adjournment, and said that he would wait for the accountant to report in detail within fourteen days before making a final decision. On the one hand, he instructed both parties to reconcile out of court.</p>
<h3>The Second Special Court Disposes of Huang Chu Jiu's Estate</h3>
<p>The Hospital's Marked Price Must Be Above 17,000</p>
<p>The Villa in Hangzhou Cannot Be Disposed of Casually</p>
<p>One-Tenth of the Movable Property Has Been Auctioned</p>
<p>The Disposition of Immovable Property Still Needs Detailed Discussion</p>
<p>The case of the Shanghai Day and Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department's bankruptcy was collectively investigated by the Second Special District Court yesterday. Judge Cao instructed the lawyers and accountant Pan that today's court session would resolve four matters: (1) Recently, the Shanghai New Medicine Industry Association requested to buy the Huang Chu Jiu Hospital at the previous marked price of 17,000 yuan. I wonder if your lawyers have any opinions on this? The creditor representative, lawyer Yan Luqing, stated that he requested the court to still publish a notice for competitive bidding, and the minimum price must be above 17,000 yuan before it could be sold. Huang's agent lawyer and accountant both expressed their agreement. Judge Cao also said that the second matter was Huang's real estate in Hangzhou. Huang's family and the mortgagee settled the case for more than 10,000 yuan. After investigation, this property is worth more than 20,000 yuan, which is a huge difference. Will it harm the interests of other creditors? What is the method of relief? Lawyer Yan stood up and said that regarding this matter, the former French Public Concession had ordered Huang's family not to dispose of it casually, and ordered it to be transferred to the Shanghai Liquidation Office for joint handling. The settlement is fundamentally invalid and should be relieved. Huang's family agent lawyer Yu Zhongluo stated that according to his lawyer's suggestion, the third creditor must go to the Hangzhou official office to request the revocation of the settlement and continue to handle it according to law to avoid damage. Judge Cao also said that the third matter was that one-tenth of the movable property had already been auctioned. The remaining part must be sold as soon as possible. Is it proper and must be discussed? Accountant Pan sued and made a statement on this point. After the first auction, the Battle of Shanghai occurred before the second auction, which happened during the war and during the lunar New Year. Even if it was auctioned, no one would be interested, so it was stopped. His accountant plans to summarize the accounts at the end of May and then auction them in June when the money market in various places is loose, so as not to suffer losses. The official also said, what about the immovable property? Lawyer Yan and others and the accountant said together, whether the above points can be reported after the lawyers representing the various creditors have discussed them in detail? Judge Cao then approved the request and announced the adjournment.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Recently, my client, Chen Wenbin, stated that he was shocked to read in the "Frontline Military News Summary" column of your newspaper on April 23rd that a special dispatch from Suzhou on the 22nd stated that Chen Wenbin had been appointed as a maintenance member after the enemy occupied Liuhe. Mr. Chen himself returned to Wuxi on March 1st, when the enemy invaded Liuhe, and on April 26th, he returned to Liuhe to inspect the goods in his Dachanghe flower shop, staying only one night. There is no truth to the matter of him holding a position as a member of the maintenance committee. It is obvious that someone is deliberately spreading rumors to endanger his life and property. Therefore, I have been specially commissioned by my client to take legal measures to protect him based on the newspaper report. I am writing to request that your newspaper make a correction and publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section. I would be most grateful. Sincerely, Lawyer Xu Fengbiao, April 26th.</p>

The total market opened with 17,000 packages of Little Twist, about 1,000 each from Saigon and Gia Lai, and the Hankou brokers took 3,000 packages of Little Twist.  Individual Yangtze River customers took 5,000 packages of Little Twist. The rest were taken by local囤户.

<p>[P Strong Disk Show at Present Flour Factory &gt;</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current flour market saw improved sentiment.  Spot goods for this month are already scarce on the market.  Local and customer demand has slightly decreased, but very little is being sold. Therefore, the opening price was 2 taels and 7 cents, but even with a reduction of 2.5 li, no sales occurred. This type of transaction is entirely in spot goods, and compared to the factory disk prices, it is indeed much cheaper. May will soon be spot month, and because the demand for spot goods is turning brisk, sentiment is naturally rising.  The initial offer was 2 taels and 7.5 cents, followed by an increase of 2.5 li, which is 5 li better than the previous day.  Currently, the factory disk remains unchanged. If the current chips become scarce and sales become more active, the market will remain firm, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Decline in Cotton Cloth Has Slowed Slightly</h3>
<p>The local factory cotton cloth market has been declining steadily recently. In the past half-month, Hubei goods have seen the steepest decline in fine cloth.

Yesterday's situation showed that the decline had slowed, but the needs of all parties have still not turned around. Subsequent cargo prices must be transferred according to the situation and how the resistance to Japan develops, it is said.</p>
<p>[P Summer Woolen Fabrics Activated &gt;</p>

<h3>North-South Goods Hunan Lotus Seed Market Price Upside Down</h3>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds previously had thin inventory, with high-grade seeds approaching 60 taels. However, since the Shanghai Incident, sales from all parties have been greatly affected, so although inventory is low, market prices have instead declined. In addition, due to recent weather conditions, there is a risk of insects and frogs.採客 have been sluggish, so they have resumed price suppression. Therefore, the market price has repeatedly declined, reaching more than ten taels before and after. Yesterday, better-quality goods were only 45 or 6 taels, but land prices remain firm, resulting in an upside-down situation, it is said.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Pigeon Straying to Chongming</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>A farmer named Zhao from Xinkai River in Chongming raises dozens of pigeons at home. A few days ago, a strange pigeon suddenly appeared among his flock. Its shape was sturdy and unlike ordinary pigeons. Zhao then used food as bait and devised a plan to capture it. Upon inspection, he found a soft tin tube tied to its leg, as thin as a chopstick and about an inch long. The end of the tube had a spiral cap. When he opened it, he found a piece of foreign text. Zhao was a local and did not even know Chinese, let alone a foreign language. He asked his neighbors, but they were all dumbfounded and did not know. The matter was learned by County Magistrate Shen of the county, who immediately telephoned the district office to buy it from Zhao for ten yuan and quickly send it to the county government for research. County Magistrate Shen was proficient in Eastern languages and translated it in detail. Only then did he learn that it was a military intelligence report sent by the Japanese army from Liuhe to Shanghai. The Chinese meaning was that the Liuhe area lacked horse feed, soldiers were mostly sick, and they were unwilling to fight, and so on. Shen immediately reported it to the provincial government and forwarded it to the military authorities for verification.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Talk Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>When I was a child, I studied under Mr. Chen Langru. Mr. Chen and my late father were close friends. They jointly subscribed to one copy of the Shen Bao. At that time, transportation in my hometown was blocked. Only two or three newspapers were subscribed to in the entire town. Every day, I would deliver the newspaper that my father had read to Mr. Chen. I did this throughout the year without interruption. I was so loyal to this job that I was almost a newspaper boy.</p>
<p>It was difficult to get newspapers in remote villages, and the villagers could not even read them. However, they always had a Shen Bao in their minds. Whenever they saw a large printed item, they would say it was Shen Bao paper. It was rare, and therefore the value of the newspaper was even more precious. My family subscribed to one newspaper, and people constantly came to the door asking for old newspapers. Giving away a few sheets would often result in them being used to patch up broken walls, mixed up and upside down, without regard for order. The lack of popularization of culture in our country can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The newspaper is a representation of the times, but its power is also sufficient to transform the times. The Shen Bao over the past sixty years has advocated for civil rights and constitutionalism, and has made some contributions to the founding of the Republic of China. However, even today, although the revolution has been completed, civil rights have not yet been realized. What the Shen Bao should strive for is even more unrelenting.</p>
<h3>A Split-Character's Words</h3>
<p>— Yunjian Poor Knight</p>
<p>Zheng Shiwei from Hunan is eloquent and penniless. Every day, he relies on split-character analysis in various teahouses in Rongcheng to make a living. His speech is like a waterfall, and his words are subtle and to the point. Therefore, his life is not so lonely. Yesterday, I saw him analyzing the character "party" for a young man in Wangjiang Tower. First, he asked the young man what it was for. The young man said he was asking about current events. Zheng then opened the floodgates and spoke volubly, saying, "Looking at the shape of the character 'party', it is quite like rules and uprightness, without party or bias. However, the top of the character 'party' is the character 'small,' which looks like a fat, dark person wearing a melon-skin pointed hat, somewhat like a fashionable singer. In the end, it feels like a pointed-head trick. Moreover, the character 'above' is '尙,' which occupies four-tenths of the entire character. Below is the character 'black,' which occupies six-tenths of the entire character. In the end, the black atmosphere is too heavy and not very noble. Even if we take the character '尙,' removing the character 'small,' it becomes '回.' If you add a small stroke to the character '口,' it becomes the character '同.' I am afraid of opening the door to party-spirit and suppressing differences, and I am even more afraid of the phenomenon of being the same without harmony. Moreover, there is only the character '口' in the character '尙,' and I am especially afraid of falling into the trap of saying one thing and thinking another, having a mouth but no heart. Again, if we take the character 'small,' its meaning is small, but what is related to it is huge. If you add a stroke below the character 'small,' it becomes the character '少.' In recent years, there have been many happy events, and many are full of vigor. I am deeply afraid of inexperience, leading to a huge disaster. If a disaster breaks out, the common people will suffer undeserved misfortune, and the overall situation will also suffer damage. Therefore, no matter how big or small the event, it is always best to be careful and cautious. Even if you feel extremely painful in your heart, you must remain extremely peaceful on the surface. At this time, when villains are gaining power, we must never show the slightest sign of anger in our words or expressions. If we do, perhaps we can turn big things into small things and small things into nothing. If we take the character 'black,' it is now a time when black and white are confused, not when black and white are distinct. There are many black hearts and few red hearts. Most of the world's humans have black eyes and only see silver. Even if there are enlightened people, they are mostly shrouded in a huge black atmosphere and there is nothing they can do. In short, it is simply not a dark world, but has become a dark hell. To seek a ray of light from this and break this black lacquer lantern, it will not be successful without the concerted effort of everyone from top to bottom." The young man reached into his pocket and took out two dimes to pay him. Zheng then thanked him and left.</p>
<h3>World Little Things Record</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>London, the capital of England, is often foggy and rainy. During the most recent three and a half months of dark skies, theft cases have occurred frequently. There have been as many as 479 cases of handbags being snatched from pedestrians on the street.</p>
<p>The authorities in southern France, in order to change the road policy, felt that the white roads, although beautiful, are too dazzling under sunlight. Therefore, they plan to completely change all the roads to red. Other second-class roads will be changed to green and yellow.</p>
<p>Many dogs are being trained in German asylums for the deaf and dumb to serve deaf and dumb people. They are taught to recognize various required signals. For example, when the dog is walking with its owner on the street, as soon as it hears the sound of a car horn, it can warn its owner in advance to avoid being hit.</p>
<p>Americans love movies the most. According to a recent survey, there are a total of 20,500 movie theaters in the country, with a total of 18.6 million seats. In all of Europe (excluding Russia), there are only 27,000 movie theaters with only 11 million seats.</p>

<p>He then answered excitedly, "I want to struggle alone and find my own way. Originally, it was useless for me to study politics and law in college. Now that soldiers are in charge, doing anything is better than being a military officer. While I don't have money to go to school, I might as well change careers early and join the army. I heard that Military Governor Ye Zuozhang in my provincial capital is making every effort to expand the army and has newly established a military academy to recruit students. I plan to go back and take the exam. First, I can use it as a place to settle down and maintain my livelihood. Second, after graduating, I can become a junior military officer and do my best to seek a future and develop. If heaven wills it, one day I will also be able to grasp great military power. I vow to severely suppress the bandits and kill Niu Heifeng to avenge my parents." Liang Xiaoyun heard this and took a puff of her cigarette. She couldn't help but chuckle and said, "I can't see that you have such great ambition. It's just a pity that it sounds like a child talking in his sleep. In today's cold and fickle world, no matter what you do in any military or political field, without someone to specifically promote you or without strong support, it is impossible to have good hope by blindly breaking through with your own little skills. You're going to be a student in a military academy, spending all your efforts and graduating in three years. At most, you'll only be a platoon or company commander. Hoping to be promoted step by step from this basic junior officer to become a division or brigade commander, with great military power in hand, so that you can eliminate Niu Heifeng, is truly more difficult than ascending to heaven. I'm afraid that by the time your hair turns white, you'll still be selling your strength in vain and just dreaming. You'll never achieve your purpose. Your plan is too clumsy." An Yutian was greatly discouraged by her ridicule and answered dejectedly, "What you say is certainly very insightful, but I have no other way to go. I can only be like a monk cultivating diligently, muddling through step by step." Liang Xiaoyun smiled and said, "I don't quite agree with your cowardly idea of leaving everything to fate. Moreover, things depend on human effort. I don't believe there's nothing to be done. In my opinion, your idea is not necessarily wrong. Although you may not be able to make it alone, there are many capable people in the world. Isn't there a reliable friend who can help you?" An Yutian quickly asked, "Who are you teaching me to ask for help from?" Liang Xiaoyun smiled and pointed to her nose carved like beautiful jade and said, "Right in front of you. Why didn't you think of me?" An Yutian was suddenly startled and then asked, "What good idea do you have?"</p>

<h3>Commemorative Matters</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>In a certain period, when a shocking event suddenly occurs, this event must be easily remembered in people's minds and easily unforgettable forever. Yesterday, I wrote a small piece of history in the supplement, describing the time I entered Shen Bao for the second time. My brother Yunhe saw it and was very suspicious. I said it was correct. He said why? I said I have a surprising fact that can be used as evidence, which is the assassination of the Manchu Governor Enming by Xu Xilin. I also published Xu Xilin's book to worship Duke Xu, and I also gained a lot of rights. Is this thing not tragic and violent enough to make me forget it from my mind?</p>
<p>In Mr. Ma's article "Sixty Years in Shanghai," which was added to the supplement, it also mentioned the interesting anecdote of Kang Shengren owing a debt for prostitution. At that time, Kang had no way to pay, so he closed his eyes and came up with a plan. He immediately jumped into the rescue boat, and a pile of dirty debts was actually paid off cleanly. Although Mr. Ma has a strong memory, he is already ninety-three years old this year. I don't know how many strange things he has experienced. Kang Shengren has been dead for many years. This fragrant and interesting history must be a thirty-year-old story, because Mr. Ma believes that this story is very interesting and valuable, so he keeps it in his mind and has not forgotten it until now. Yesterday was the 60th anniversary of this newspaper, and I re-mentioned the tragic and violent assassination of Enming by Xu Xilin. Mr. Ma Xiangbo mentioned Kang Shengren's romantic anecdotes. This kind of special and interesting thing is unforgettable, and because of the 60th anniversary of this newspaper, mentioning this matter is even more unforgettable. Alas! Don't forget the 60th anniversary of this newspaper.</p>
<h3>Wen Jian Friends Lyrics Tune "Waves Wash Sand"</h3>
<p>— Yan Yie</p>
<p>I laugh at myself for no reason, old and melancholy, talking about the present and the past, mourning spring and autumn, having sad words that cannot be spoken, national disaster and family hatred, ashamed to rely on Liu, forcing myself to climb the tower, pitying myself in the world like floating scum, last night my soul returned to my hometown in a dream, suspecting there was a rabbit fur coat,</p>
<h3>Grieving the Times</h3>
<p>An old man with white hair in his declining years, also mixed in the refugees, indulging in chanting in a pale day, who can be like Taibai with good wine, the body is like a diamond, why not break, the eyes see the jade Buddha all empty, I only hear people say, the red fire of artillery is everywhere,</p>
<p>Suffering from widowhood has always been better than suffering from poverty, power is not flesh and blood, but also close, fat belly, genius of heaven, nagging title, national disaster people, monks in the kitchen, thieves in the tatami, inequality is also called equality, wanting to ask the Buddha the root cause,</p>
<p>Passing through Zhabei by car, the eyes are full of desolation, the prosperous market of the past, now a field of rubble, the officials play with the invaders, the people suffer too much, want to cry but no place, tears crisscrossing,</p>
<h3>Crying Book Chapter</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zun</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, I hear an old man crying, I ask the old man why he is crying, from now on there will be no books to read, I remember when I first bought a book, it was like visiting a famous sister, meeting each other beautifully, spending more than a thousand gold, returning to the bookshelf, boasting about being old, hiding deeply like a virgin, few people are fortunate enough to visit, sitting alone in the book building, facing each other happily, spring breeze and autumn moon, reading and drinking wide, scrolls read hundreds of times, Song edition or Ming copy, a word is rubbed several times, every word is gold and jade, also know the country is worried, I live in Shenjiang, my home is near the foreign concession, singing and dancing for decades, I say I will end this life, extracting ancient secrets, king of a hundred cities, I will not count the matter of sealing the marquis, why is heaven not kind, blowing up the dust of Penglai, the fire of the first month of Yangchun, I protect the unconscious god, when will the fire stop, the sound of crying books is endless, I want to die with the book, my wife and children are forced to pull me up, alas, alas, there is nothing outside the body, my body is not worth cherishing, I will not see my book again, tut, tut, half a lifetime of heart and blood, where to summon the soul of the book, and say goodbye to the book forever,</p>
<p>[P Scientific Adhesives</p>
<p>— Huang Wei</p>
<p>Leather, paper, wood, and glass are commonly bonded with glue. However, these types of adhesives lose their effectiveness when exposed to water. Shellac flakes are not wetted by water and are excellent adhesives. They can be used for both metal and non-metal objects. Heat the shellac flakes and add a small amount of alcohol to dissolve them before use.</p>
<p>There are several types of adhesives for glass. Shellac flakes are one of them. This type of adhesive can only prevent water from entering. If used in alcohol, it loses its effectiveness. Therefore, chemical labs and pharmacies often have no choice but to use imported adhesives. However, if you take a small amount of rubber tubing, heat it and dissolve it, and then add carbon disulfide until it becomes a thin liquid, you can apply this liquid to the area to be bonded. Its effectiveness is no different from imported products.</p>
<p>Sodium silicate is the best adhesive for glass and metal. Its strength is unmatched by other types of adhesives.</p>
<p>The above types of glass adhesives are all effective in commercial use and each has its own advantages. However, if you want to bond glass to glass and make it transparent, you must use Canadian balsam. Many bulletproof glasses are made of numerous very thin pieces of glass bonded together with this adhesive.</p>
<p>Artificial ivory is a compound of guncotton and camphor. There are many products on the market recently. The white panels of organs and pianos, children's toys, etc. are all made of it. If you want to bond it, you can take a small piece of artificial ivory and dissolve it in acetone before using it to bond objects.</p>
<p>Forging bonding to bonding seems the same but is actually different. The medication must wait for a separate topic and discussion.</p>
<p>East West North South</p>
<h3>One-Sided Views on National Salvation Plans</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Since China has had national disasters, I have intentionally or unintentionally read quite a few national salvation plans from scholars and celebrities.</p>
<p>Another national salvation plan! Another national salvation plan!</p>
<p>However, can these plans really save the country? Although this is still a question (sorry! gentlemen, I apologize!), this can be largely ignored, why? Because that is at least a "concrete plan" with thoughtful consideration. At the very least, the drafter himself can completely believe in its "existence," right?</p>
<p>Some advocate a one-party dictatorship. —They say this is the advocacy of nationalism.</p>
<p>Some advocate restoring relations with the Soviet Union. —They say this is the view of the left. (According to Chinese law, this has the suspicion of being a communist party.)</p>
<p>Some say align with the United States. —Which faction's advocacy is this?</p>
<p>Some say always believe in the League of Nations. —Which faction's advocacy is this? ... And so on.</p>
<p>Justice is upright. All roads lead to Rome.</p>
<p>Of course, when there is a "national disaster" one must "save the country," which is the unanimous voice of patriotic people. For example, during the European War, the German government and celebrities all advocated "fighting for the glory of the motherland." When the Soviet Union encountered an attack by the great powers, it also incited the workers to "support the workers' motherland." Even this time, the Japanese also shouted "open up the national disaster!" and also "maintain the special rights and dignity of this empire," and did not hesitate to send heavy troops to "punish Chinese warlords." (Note carefully, the tone is extremely clever!) In this way, there is no doubt that the "country" should be "saved," what remains is the way to save the country.</p>
<p>In this way, these grand articles are extremely useful. Alas! Magnificent!</p>
<p>However, those who implement the plan are out there, are they willing to "prescribe according to the law" according to the "prescription" of the gentlemen? Otherwise, to implement it, one must first "govern." Then, if you are in power, are you willing to do it impartially without betraying your previous words? Do you not plan for your own "interests" at all? This is hard to say.</p>
<p>As for having the hope of governing or even crossing the threshold of an official yamen after first coming up with a national salvation plan, this should be an inevitable truth.</p>
<p>Moreover, the so-called national disaster is not necessarily only the Anti-Japanese War, just like the scope of discussion prescribed by the Luoyang National Disaster Conference. Therefore, scholars and celebrities! You must hurry to include "appeasement..." in your plan, otherwise it will not be easy to realize the rejoicing of the gentlemen in the future, right?</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>Two Impressions</h3>
<p>— Gan Fang</p>
<p>The sound of artillery is far away, the school bell rings. I can't believe that I can still be educated when my motherland is dying. I'm almost crazy with joy carrying my schoolbag.</p>
<p>This is the new school site. The school building is small, and there is not even a rest room. After class, I wandered alone on the sunbathing platform, because I was transferred here during this school's big sale. I didn't know a single strange person. I opened the book boredly, half spread on the railing and half in my hand. I can't see the playground, laughing, fighting, making a lot of noise. Four or five people sat in a circle near the playground, and they were all holding small, long-style cards in their hands. The red plum blossoms deeply attracted my attention. I knew they were playing poker.</p>
<p>I hurried to class, the bell had already rung, and I squeezed into the classroom, but there were no seats left. An unfamiliar classmate gave up half of his seat for me. The short and dark teacher was lecturing on "differentiation of characters." Two minutes later, he suddenly stopped. "Please don't smoke in class! The classroom is too small, the number of people is too large, and the air is no longer clean. It's too heartbreaking to mention these things—our own spacious lecture hall has been occupied by others." His eyelids fluttered faster, and he spoke sincerely and sadly to the classmate in the back row who was smoking. But he also felt that it was too embarrassing for him to say this, so he quickly covered up and said, "I am also a smoking king, I just don't smoke in the classroom."</p>
<p>What time is this? The cannons haven't stopped, the soldiers haven't retreated, the national hatred hasn't been avenged. We are young people, how can this ambition be relaxed? But the first impression given to me was so, making my hot blood run cold from head to toe. I knew that this was the achievement of university education! When I write here, I sincerely hope that our leaders, especially those who run university education, should not talk empty words of saving the country, the education received is not suitable for today, this group of half-fallen young people, this group of future masters of China, if not thoroughly reformed and strictly trained, let them be free and unrestrained again, then we are ready to see China perish! Conscience compels me to petition my dear teachers with blood and tears.</p>

<h3>Unconventional Comfort Items</h3>
<p>— Cang</p>
<p>This Shanghai war, which has aroused global sympathy and is fought for the survival of our nation, has yet to bring us, the people, to a final victory. However, the general public has been very enthusiastic in offering comfort to our loyal and brave armed comrades who are fighting for the glory of the nation. Besides money, countless other military supplies and necessities have been provided. Among these many comfort items, three are particularly noteworthy and unbelievable. First, an American gave five US dollars as a token of comfort. He also included a letter with many words of admiration. At the end, he said that five dollars was not enough to distribute to all the brothers, but he hoped that they could buy a few bullets to resist the inhuman enemy.</p>
<p>Second, overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia sent two book coupons from the Commercial Press, worth only two yuan and two jiao. In their letter, they also said that this was not enough to comfort them, but asked them to buy a few more bullets.</p>
<p>Third, someone sent a mandarin jacket as a gesture of comfort, without explaining its intention, which was baffling. Aren't the above three comfort items unconventional?</p>
<p>Random Talk</p>
<h3>Who is the Traitor?</h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>A few days ago, newspapers published a letter from Mr. Xiong Xiling to President Wang Jingwei, stating that President Wang had said during the Central Memorial Week that Mr. Xiong was a co-signer of the Twenty-One Demands and a traitor! He is now in Shanghai, and if he comes to Luoyang to attend the National Crisis Conference, we will kill him! Therefore, Mr. Xiong defended himself, saying that although he had served as the Prime Minister of the State Council in the fourth year of the Republic of China, he had already resigned when the Twenty-One Demands, a treaty of national betrayal, were signed. He asked President Wang to verify the official records before speaking. He also respectfully advised President Wang that, at a time of national crisis, those in important positions must be cautious for the sake of the country. We, the common people, do not wish to criticize the rights and wrongs of you gentlemen, but it is indeed true that Mr. Xiong was not a co-signer of the Twenty-One Demands, a treaty of national betrayal. Then, who is the traitor who signed the treaty of national betrayal?</p>
<p>It is none other than the notorious traitor Lu Zengxiang, one of the three great traitors Cao, Lu, and Zhang. It is said that Lu Zengxiang, feeling remorseful for signing the treaty of national betrayal, has abandoned his family and gone abroad to become a monk!</p>
<p>At this time of national crisis, these old accounts can be ignored. If we were to settle old scores, I fear that the accounting would be more harmful than beneficial. However, "before old debts are settled, hold your tongue." Although old accounts can be ignored, new ones must not be added. When a nation is about to perish, there will be demons. If, at this time, we do not produce Yue Fei but instead produce many more Qin Huis, what will we do? I advise the common people not to let go of traitors!</p>

It is a masterpiece that combines sorrow, humor, and music in one. In this world, things are rarely as one wishes, and most people are heartbroken. Chatterton in the film is no exception. If lovers could always be together, the joy of companionship would be self-evident. Alas, heaven is unkind, burning the zither and boiling the crane, causing endless sorrow and grief. Ah, Chatterton's performance is delicate, profound, and deeply moving. The comedic star, Arnold Korff, already left us with a deep impression with his performance in "Transatlantic". Now, he interjects hilarious jokes into the film, allowing us to find some joy in sorrow. His adjustment is especially good. The film is purely musical and artistic, featuring six new songs composed by Herbert Stothart, a major modern American composer. The lyrics are profound and extraordinary, and they are paired with beautiful music. The supporting actress, Clara Blandick, has a bold and flamboyant style. This film opened at the largest Loews Theatre in the United States and broke all previous box office records, not by chance.</p>
<h3>Carlton Shows "Private Lives"</h3>
<p>"Private Lives," which is showing at the Carlton, is a superb film selected from hundreds of British films. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the largest film company in the United States, spent a large sum of money to acquire the exclusive screening rights for the film in the United States. When it premiered in the United States, all the viewers praised it unanimously. The success in box office broke all records. This film is not only tightly plotted, but also has an excellent structure, which is rare because it does not fall into the usual clichés. As for the star of this film, she is a London stage star who is famous for a time. Her performance is so realistic that it can bring tears to the eyes.</p>
<h3>"Heartbroken Flower" Coming Soon</h3>
<p>A weak woman. She wants to move upward with all her heart. But the unfortunate fate, the adverse environment, and the criticism of society all want to drive her into hell. This is such a heartbreaking thing. That is why the film "Heartbroken Flower" is able to make people shed tears. The "Heartbroken Flower" in the film was originally a very virtuous girl from a humble family. But that unfortunate fate followed her every step of the way, causing her to live a life of wretchedness. And for helping her beloved son to become famous, she did not hesitate to sacrifice her beauty and engage in the profession of selling laughter. As a result, although her beloved son was fortunately successful, she was devastated. In short, from beginning to end, this film can be said to have scene after scene of blood and word after word of tears. Needless to say, emotional people will be moved to tears by it, and even those with hearts of stone will shed tears after watching it. There is also one thing that is most rare, that is, the leading actress, Helen Twelvetrees, plays the roles of four different eras, and they are all lifelike. Her makeup skills and performance ability are not something that can be accomplished without artistic talent. It is said that this film will soon be released at the Cathay Theatre.</p>
