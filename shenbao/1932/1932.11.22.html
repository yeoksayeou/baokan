<p>時評</p>
<h3>由招商局事件所引起之感想誠</h3>
<p>最近發生之招商局出押四棧事件。已引起社會人士極大之注意。誰應負此一案件之責任。與夫此案究應作如何之處置。社會大抵已有公論。吾人殊不願抑亦不必再作若何之論斷獨是。由此一事件。之剌激。吾人所生。。之感想則至多。謹申言之。</p>
<p>第一招商局自創辦迄今。已已六十处之歷史。同時成立之洋商航業公司。無不有驚人之進步。獨招商局則六十年來不僅未見擴充。更且每况愈下。年賴舉債以維持其殘喘。即今年亦已虧百七十餘萬元。因之航業日益凋落。</p>
<p>航權亦日被侵奪。影響所至。不僅招商局本身瀕於奄奄一息。即我全國之交通與工商業之發展。亦無形遭受絕大之打擊。所以致此。雖原因。不一。而。「缺乏保管責任心。」要亦爲其最要之一端。</p>
<p>據「國民政府清管整理招商局委員會報吿書」有云。「查自壬戍至丙寅</p>
<p>最近五年内。歷年虧折總額。計有四百三十七萬餘兩。然總滬局每年發給員司酬勞金五年共計。二十四萬五千九百九十四兩。查自癸亥年來。股東。未獲得分文息金。乃局中員司獨享此厚酬。」</p>
<p>又有曰「∶∶∶修理費總計每年約六七十萬兩。：：：而内河廠（所承辦）實居最多數。約占全額之半。查丙寅年内河廠共計修理費三十一萬四千餘兩∶∶∶惟内河廠旣係該局附屬　枝機關。内部辦事人員當然與該局辦事者關係甚密。∶∶∶曾經本會函調帪籍備查。而該廠忽以賬房失蹤。帪簿遺失呈報。内中情形不問可知矣。</p>
<p>就上錄報吿書所述兩點而言。已可灼見「缺乏保管責任心。」殆即爲招商局最大之積弊。惟無保管責任心。故營私·舞弊·中飽·不負責。公私不分。種種弊端。皆從而滋生。此次出押四棧事件。要亦即爲弊端表現之一幕。前美使館商務參贊安諾德先生在「中國問題裏的幾個根本問題」一書中曾有云「保管責任之觀念。在華人中無論如何努力。終不能確立其穩定之意義。∶∶∶此弊爲狀不一。根深而普遍」安氏之言。至足令吾人警惕反省。而此次出押四棧事件之發生。則又不啻爲安氏之言加以有力之證明。雖然。吾人試一默察當前種種不負責公私不分之所表現於事實者。又豈僅此次招商局出押四棧事件而已。吾人又從可知招商局出押四棧事件之發生。絕非偶然。病根深種。由來已久。出押四棧事件之澈底查辦。固爲絕對應然。而如何拔去此深種之病根。則尤爲切要。</p>
<p>第二。官僚政治。實爲障滯我國政治莫克步上軌道之最大癥結。迄至今日。此種政治之實質。更普通侵入各個部門。無論公營或私營之事業。都無不侵入兼攬多職遙領空銜。排斥異已安挿私人。所謂「一人得道。雞犬皆可昇天。」所謂「一朝天子一朝臣。」種種官僚政治之實質。殆無處不顯明暴露。招商局雖爲商營。而歷年把握其實權者。大抵皆爲失意之官僚政客故其被刼持於官僚政治之下。巳非一朝。復以其連年虧累。不爲人所重視之故。狡黠者得更據爲營私舞弊之窟。此去彼來。惡習相乘。亦匪伊一朝。如今日四棧之出押。又不過爲數十年來官僚政治之複演。脱從更大者更遠者而言。則肅清貪汚。扶植廉潔。其根本之道。則又在於　掘官僚政治之根基。</p>
<p>嗟乎。「天下攘攘皆爲利往。天下熙熙。皆爲利來。」徵諸老氏之言。可知人存私慾。今古無殊然而欲人無私慾固誰能具此偉力。能之者其感在於心理之澈底改造乎。其或在於社會制度之逐漸改善乎。以故吾人對於此次四棧出押事件。固極重視。而於四棧出押事件發生之意義及其由來。則尤爲重視。去者已矣。吾人其更注目於來茲。</p>
<h3>外交戰開始</h3>
<p>國聯空氣頓形緊張</p>
<p>行政院昨日開會聽取兩當事國意見</p>
<p>松岡肆鼓簧極盡詆毀我國能事顧維鈞博士據理逐層痛加駁斥滿案爭執解决權在特别大會日本以在行政院討論爲有利</p>
<p>▲國民社二十一日日内瓦電國聯行政院今日在緊張空氣中集會、考慮李頓報吿主席凡勒拉於今晨十時二十分在國民旅社禮堂（即國聯秘書廳所在）宣吿開會、中國代表顧維鈞在其右、日代表松岡洋右在其左、分座於馬鞍式會議席之兩旁、其餘各理事依次就席、每　代表前咸置有李頓調查團報吿　份、此爲李頓勳爵馬柯迪佰爵克考台將軍麥考益少將與希尼博士調查數月一致同意之結果、國聯希望在此中覔一將滿洲交還中國、而仍可使日人不致退出國聯之調解方法者也、至會塲中外交人員新聞記者及公衆旁聽席、則莫不人爲之滿、</p>
<p>▲路透二十一日日内瓦電今晨國聯行政院開特别會議、考虜李頓報吿書會場中人甚擁擠、李頓勳爵及調查團其他各委員皆坐於旁聽席中、議長凡勒拉略述李頓報吿書之起源、讚美調查團所成就之工作稱其報吿書爲光明文件、令人欣賀、使人興奮、渠特向李頓等道謝、凡勒拉繼乃追述此項爭執中之程序、并言及國聯大會成立十九委員會之舉動、旋請日代表松岡陳述其意見、同時聲明午後會議將予中代表之同樣機會、十一時四十分鐘日代表松岡開始發言、其所陳述者、不外乎日本意見書之輪廓謂李頓報吿書以整個言、尤以叙述章叚言、實供給有價値的事實上眞相其中且有數節、完全與日政府意見一致、日人願首先對於李頓調查團之工作表示誠摯之感謝、惟此報吿書經長期研究後覺演繹殊欠適當、故吾人已繕擬若干意見、供國聯行政院考慮、希望行政院對此意見、予以完全考量、報吿書中對於中國前途之樂觀態度、日本未能贊同實則中國情形、今較華盛頓開會時尤爲惡劣、昔時中國未有赤禍今則蔣介石親自討共矣、惟國民政府與國民黨猶不放棄其數年前政使各外國政府增多其駐滬防兵之原則、自國民黨採用急進思想以來、中國對外之關係迄無進步、國民政府充滿排外主義而不懈的工作、謀養成靑年仇外之心理、中國五千萬兒童發育於劇烈思想之勢力下、此爲最近將來中之可怖難題、在華日人遭遇多年之抵制、現被用爲國家政策之工具、以期達到廢除外人條約權利之目的、列强立約、以戰爭法外舉動、余將</p>
<p>詢問行政院有官塲或半官塲性質之抵制、何以國聯不應痛斥之、而認爲法外舉動乎、李頓報吿書有數處流露日本仇視之意、其實不然、日政府確信中國人民被誤導、被脅迫、且被誤解其意見、日政府知中國人民之主要願望、在和平享受其勤勞之結果耳、日本現維持其舊有之友誼、而期望兩國間繁榮與友好的合作之時期云松岡言及李頓報吿書所稱九一八藩陽附近鐵路所遭之損失、不足爲軍事行</p>
<p>動之理由節、謂此次爆發、僅就其本身言之、本無關十分重要但報吿書未曾詳</p>
<p>言此種局勢之嚴重背景、苟此事發生於另一時期、而非緊張若是之甚者、則調查團之意見、當屬正確而合理、日本不能依允調查團所發九一八夜軍事行動不能被</p>
<p>認爲合法自衛計畫之結論云、松岡言至．</p>
<p>此乃引證一九二八年六月二十三日凱洛格之公文、内稱自衛權爲任何主權國所賦有、亦爲任何條約所含蓄松岡繼又引證美參院在批准此約時所通過之議</p>
<p>案、内稱、自衛權之實施、當在實際上�</p>
<p>擴至行使自衛權國家之領土管轄界限之外、松岡又引證一九二八年五月十九日與一九二八年七月十八日英外相張伯倫之兩函、英政府在第一函中表示意見以爲美國草約條欵不屏絕被迫自衛國之行爲、并聲明英國在某區域内、其福利與完整與英國和平安全有特殊關係者、决不容許外來之干涉第二函表示意見、以爲此約絕不限制或損害自衛權、唯國家自</p>
<p>己有酌視環境採行自衛戰爭之資格、松岡續稱、日政府鑒於上述之明白保留、認定其軍事行動爲自衛行爲、此種權利、巴</p>
<p>黎非戰公約對之並不發生疑問、或予以否認、此固人所明白了解者也日本之所以不將滿洲問題提交國聯者、其理由如下、㈠民意不許外來干涉㈡國聯手續勢必費時頗久、恐大損日僑在滿之地位、㈢在西方人士辯論之際、時局恐將有劇變、而日人解决之希望或將延長過久、㈣事</p>
<p>件在爆發時、實循其天然途徑而行渠不認滿洲乃中國整個的一部分之說、凡被人承認之中國政府、從未有管轄權及於</p>
<p>滿洲者、調查團所稱恢復原狀無以使人滿意一節、渠表同情、但調查團所稱維持現狀、亦屬不能使人滿意一節、則渠完全</p>
<p>不能同意、「滿洲國」之建設、似屬唯一可能的解决方法此日本之所以予以承認也除此而外之其他觡决方法、不待實行、即僅僅考慮、亦足使遠東全局受嚴重之騷擾、使「滿洲國」現存之信任人心、將因此而搖動、而中國方面擾亂之謀、更將因以活動、日人决然不能加入此種考慮、李頓調查團對於東三省氏獨立運動之眞確、加以欵問、要知「滿洲國」之組織、非日人所發起、但基於滿洲人民脱離張學良之志願、調查團所得關於此事之許多情報、似未注意之、日本文武官吏皆不許參加滿洲成立新政治制度之謀、渠爲之扼腕者、調查團似接受張學良方面所供给之報吿、而不注重「滿洲國」官吏之言論、試舉例言之、「滿洲國」之可驚的進步、如財政預算事、未嘗見諸報吿畫、至於今日滿洲之亂氛未始非中國援助所致、其顧明旨趣、在對西方世界作不滿意之表示耳、如以滿洲所發生之事歸罪日本、則殊失平允、如中國全部感僅滿洲一處早有適當之統治、而日人之生命權利得免於故意摧殘之舉動、則何致發生變化、吾人之自衛行爲、出於天然自動、而在吾人作自衛行爲時獨立運動遂亦自　發作、松岡言至此、取希臘那伐尼諾爲喩、該處之偶爾槍擊、及自衛之還擊、遂成立希臘之獨立、松岡績稱、滿洲境内之結果、不由日本負責、負其責者、爲中國及張學良之政府、此乃其自己作爲所致、與日無尤、而其所作爲者實違反日本屢次之警吿、日本旣未破壞國聯盟約九國公約、亦未破壞巴黎非戰公約、請國聯行政院少安勿躁、而以慷慨加諸中國之忍耐、稍加諸日本、日本不欲與他國開戰、亦不欲擴大其領土、日本非侵略國、日人深切誠摯希望其偉大鄰國得享福利耳云云、</p>
<p>▲路透二十一日日内瓦電國聯行政院今日午後之會議、開會稍遲、因顧維鈞博士到會稍諼也、聞顧博士之演詞、半屬豫先擬就、餘爲答覆今晨松岡言論之詞、</p>
<p>（日内瓦）我代表顧維鈞二十一日下午在國聯行政會席上演說、痛駁日代表松岡上午所述各點、略謂日本之傳統的侵略政策、始爲和平之眞正的威脅、中國之經濟抵制僅爲自衛行動、且每次經濟抵制、均由於日本之侵略而起、中國不能對此負責、且此亦非無理智之行動中國亦從未排外、現在無數之外僑安居中國、雖日僑今日亦受同樣保護、華人今日之對日惡感、概因日本之侵略而發生中國要求恢復被人刦奪而損失之權利、中國深知由協商之道、當能使自然的政策實、現望國聯予中國以正義云云（二十一日中央社電）</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯二十一日日内瓦電關於行政院今晨開始討論滿洲爭議一事、俟中日兩國代表各自陳述意見以後、現在日内瓦之李頓調查團或將由行政院就雙方當事國對於報吿書所提出之異議加以諮詢、因此最近數日之内李頓調查團當與行政院同時集會、一般人預料、行政院將於本星期以内專議滿洲事件、其討論結果、不至遽下結論惟以關於滿洲事件之卷宗、連同中日兩國最近反所提出之文件、併移送國聯會大會或移交比國代表希孟所主持之十九國委員會、則尤有可能、十九國委員會在十二月初以前不至開會、蓋希孟將因十一月二十九日比國總選舉、在該國京城居留故也、</p>
<p>國民社二十日日内瓦電茲據國聯秘書廳某職員談、日本對於李頓報吿書之意見書中所提出之解决滿洲問題之各種建議表示反對日本之意見書共五十頁、對於調查團調查之方法、頗肆强烈之抨擊、稱該調查團對於爭論最重要之各點、均根據子極端可欵之證據而加判斷云、李頓報吿書對於現在之滿洲僞國旣不主張加以維持、故日本意見書復竭力聲明該僞國之成立、非但與日本所已經訂立之各種國際條件並無抵觸、且與滿洲地方人民之志願亦甚相合、實爲與中國成立諒解之唯一圓滿之根據云、再則李頓報吿書中所主張之國際共管及設立國際警憲等等、日本意見書則一筆抹殺、謂此等方策萬難維持滿洲之治安、云</p>
<p>（南京）外部接日内瓦代表團電吿、李頓報吿二十三日提出行政院會議討論、二十一日二十二日商手續及程序、日方主張中日問題即由行政院討論、反對提十九國委員會及特别大會、蓋以行政院祗大國參加、活動較爲便利、大會則五十餘國參加、且小國素抨擊日本侵略政策、於日不利、但本年二月十二日我國已根據盟約第十五條請提大會討論、並經大會受理、故中日爭端討論權早入大會之手、此次因李頓調查團係行政院所派出、故不得不先由行政院討論、至最後討論及解决權仍屬大會日雖活動、但各國决難同意、結果失敗、毫無欵義（二十一日中央社電）</p>
<p>▲電通社二十一日東京電據今晨由日内瓦日代表部致外務省之情報稱、松岡代表自渡歐以來、總合與各國代表由私的折衝所得之印象、國聯方面持下列之之見解、中日問題自去秋、九月以來、曾受國聯盟約第十一條之適用、後因中國方面於今年二月十二日提出召集總會之牒文、故二月十九日之理事會、决移牒總會、適用盟約第十五條、然報吿書之審議、一應在理事會所爲者、其决定的解决則移牒總會云、日政府對之、當即於今日致如下之訓電與在日内瓦之松岡代表、㈠認國聯盟約第十五條之發動者、爲限於上海事件、關於滿洲國者曾始終附以保留、㈡調查團係據理事會之决議而所任命者、然其報吿書之審議、應由理事會爲之、依此根本理由、理事會不爲原則的裁决、而漫然將問題移牒總會、是所絕對反對云、</p>
<p>▲路透二十日日内瓦電自日本提出答覆李頓報吿之說帖後、一般觀察咸認危機已迫、日方之說帖措辭頗爲精密、但其說明日本立塲之各點則措調强硬、足以表示日本無接受李頓調查團所建議之各點、現各方咸信根據　約第十　條由行政院進行調解手續已無望、現國聯特别大會已將討論中日問題之權、授與十九人委員會、則行政院已處於特殊之地位、行政院之責任在謀中日糾紛之調解現根據顔惠慶之宣言及日本之說帖、調解已屬無望、現十九人委員會即將討論對於李頓之報吿書應採何種行動云、</p>
<p>▲路透二十日日内瓦電此間一般人咸信中日糾紛、已有造成重大危機之趨勢、現國聯大會討論中日問題、將於十一月二十日上午一時開始辯論、屆時日代表松岡將報吿日本之立塲、中國方面由顧維鈞答覆、雙方之觀察、將交李頓調查團加以批評、此事之趨向若何、尙難逆料、但一般人土咸抱想觀、因日本旣已表示拒絕李頓報吿書、中國代表顔惠慶於演說中亦態度强硬、表示中國將援引盟約第十六條規定懲罰侵略國之辦、法雙方旣各走極端、由行政院根據盟約第十一條設法調解已屬無望、大會現除將報吿送交十九人委員會外、已無他法、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯二十日日内瓦電國聯會行政院討論滿洲問題之期、迫於眉睫、中日兩國爲此事各派多數人員、組織代表團、前往日内瓦、中國代表團計共五十人、日本代表團則達七十人、日本特派代表松岡洋右已於昨日將日本對李頓報吿書之意見、備文送交國聯秘書長德魯蒙爵士、松岡已拜訪美代表台維斯及國聯行政院主席凡勒拉、今日將繼續拜訪中國代表團、亦有所活動、</p>
<p>▲路透二十一日東京電日内瓦日本全權松岡昨在國聯無線電播音臺演說、此間清晰可聞、即遞傳於全國各地、松岡於演說中切言列强承認「滿洲國」、實爲恢復遠東和平之唯一途徑</p>

<p>謂遠東局勢尙未絕望</p>
<p>諷示日本勿蠻幹到底</p>
<p>▲路透二十日日内瓦電李頓勳爵今日從國聯播音台發表昭吿世人之言論、謂遠東形勢雖屬可慮、但非無望今日固爲世界大可憂慮之時期、但渠望起自滿洲之波濤、可爲賢明的政治手腕所挽回、</p>
<p>東省現狀違反條約所爭非僅唯握政權</p>
<p>滿洲現有之時局、不可視爲與現有條約相合今所爭之點、較管理滿洲者應爲中國或爲日本之問題、尤爲重大、即維持國家間和平的共同責任之原則、應否保全抑聽令犧牲是己云、</p>
<p>日認僞國絕不合理戰禍不已於已無益</p>
<p>李頓言及日本之承認「滿洲國」、謂若一種舉動、本身爲絕不合理者、則不能僅因其已成事實、而認爲合理、調查團報吿書所建議之解决辦法、終有益於日本、因日本欲在中國仇視及民界憤懣之時維持現狀、則代價必奇鉅也、如東三省不復有循環不已之衝突危險則亦與中國有益云</p>
<p>調查團之虚與委蛇不得視爲承認表示</p>
<p>李頓勳爵言及調查團游東三省事、謂調查團不能承認自稱爲獨立國政府之人、調查團僅能示以禮儀上之敬意、如拜客時着禮服戴帽及共飲香檳酒而已、但調查團固明白表示不能承認其國家或其職位之存在也、李頓勳爵勸世人忍耐信任、謂人或因國聯用討論與會議之方法從事進行、而遂不忍耐、要知此種方法、在調解中實屬必要云、</p>

<p>▲路透二十日日内瓦電中代表顔惠慶今日午後語外國新聞記者、謂中國未有欲推翻李頓報吿書結論之意、中國對於報吿書之各點不盡同意、但以爲中立委員團以雙方所承認之著聞人士所組所者、其所有之結論、非雙方任何一方所宜駁斥、况事實固甚昭著也、中國現不聲稱已採行直接違反李頓調查團提議或勸吿、或反抗國聯及其條約義務之政策、亦不宣佈以　武主義爲一種清潔榮譽之事、中國抵抗日人　武主義已逾一年、吾人準備機續抵抗、久而弗懈、如遇必要、亦將用武、以清除吾人國境内之敵軍但吾人固恨戰事、而切望和平也、吾人來此、請國聯予吾人以和平與公道、不幸日本軍閥不欲和平而欲戰爭、不以日内瓦之會議、爲公平解决之工具、但視爲一種機會、一面仍進行其對華不宣而戰之軍事行動、一面欲得拒絕外來干涉之消極的國際擔保、吾人信任對國聯保持信用、猶之吾人信任將來時機到時、國聯會員國亦必對中國保持信用也、中代表或將援用國聯盟約其他數條云、顔博士引李頓報吿書之文、稱述中政府討共之切實成功繼言及東三省地位、謂東三省不宜於日本殖民、再日人之所謂東三省獨立運動、在日軍侵八以前、實無所聞、今時機</p>

<p>日意見書終難自圓其說</p>
<h3>美官塲力避正式批評但表示願與國聯合作</h3>
<p>▲國民社二十日華盛頓電美國當道對於日本之李頓報吿意見書、因恐正式評論後、被人誤認爲問接干涉國聯、故今日僅非正式表示意見、以爲該意見書幾難自圓其說内有許多方面與美國之見解逈殊、即其他各點、其理由亦殊薄弱、美要人之居負責任地位者、對於日人所持九國公約不適用於滿洲爭執之立塲、尤難贊同、認此種立塲、絕難自圓其說、因美國信九國公約、專爲保障中國之統一而設、今以日本軍事行動結果中國之統一、已直接爲之破壞美國固願承認中國今方缺乏某種之統一現象、與國内之缺乏安定、但當締結九國公約之時、日本與其他簽約國、均早已明白承認此種事實且於完全深知中國狀况之後、同意商定不加干涉、美當道又謂當九國公約提出討論之時、中國國内正在各軍閥相峙中、南方旣不與北京政府合作、而東三省又自爲政令、且爲中國本部一部份之眞正統治者、考當時所以締結此約者、此即爲其理由之一、惟日本之意見書旣單獨政國聯、故美當道認爲與美國無涉、不必加以正式評論並表示美國在國聯討論之時、雖暫不活動、但可爲國聨諸會員國保證者、苟其所認爲應取之步驟、美國必予以完全之同情與合作、某大吏又謂美國抱此態度、即所以消極的贊助國聯解决爭執也、至官塲以外之人、則對於日本意見書、並不驚異、報紙雖刋登於顯著地位、而一般輿論則稱其中所言者、日本宣傳家早在此間道及固已飫聞之矣、</p>
<p>▲路透社二十一日紐約電紐約講壇報今日批評中日問題之最近一幕、謂日本外交家未必責備其軍閥之行爲、日本軍閥竭力使民衆誤信以美國爲領袖之西方國家現欲使日本處於孤立之境而摧殘之、該報又謂時間爲滿洲問題解决中之重要原素、十一月七日胡佛總統曾稱、美政府不願參加用軍事或經濟壓力實施非戰公約之任何計畫、該報對於此語加以稱讚謂胡佛總統如此揭示之美國政策、决不致爲日本人民所誤解總統之言論、嚴格的以確定美國在華之條約權利爲限、任何行動凡可引起懲戒之實施、致釀成戰爭狀態者、美國概不與聞、此舉殊關重要云云、</p>
<h3>日本一再製造直接交涉空氣</h3>
<p>▲華聯社二十一日東京電日外部今日再利用其機關通信社「日本新聞聯合社」、散布直接交涉空氣、因國聯空氣日壞、如堅持反對李頓報吿書及行政院或大會之决議、日本則被認爲侵略主義國、祗知有槍砲、不知有公理、外交將陷入僵局、乃以直接交涉爲名、拒絕公開討論、據傅日外交部對某大國提議、、囑其帮助、其策略列左</p>
<p>㈠若拒絕大會討論中日紛爭、則各國均憤日本暴蠻、討論仍然任其討論、但無論何種提案均不同意使各國不能得到任何結果、遂放之自然推移、㈡造此空氣若成功、則乘機議决以六個月爲限、勸吿中日直接交涉、㈢須認「滿洲國」爲獨立國參加交涉、</p>
<p>▲日聯二十一日東京電審議中日爭執問題之國聯第六十九屆理事會、今晨十一時在國聯秘書廳開幕、然因本問題之性質頗重大又複雜、從來指導解决問題之大國首腦人、亦未曾言及問題之解决方法、因此衆科國聯無能力解决中日問題、祗得袖手傍觀、然至理事會開會之直前、忽有某國聯最高首腦人傳出國聯方面解决本問題之方針、該項報吿於二十日由日内瓦日本代表團電致日外務省、其大體意旨如次、</p>
<p>㈠國聯由理事會及大會討論中日紛爭之全般的問題㈡國聯不作直接解决紛爭之辦法、但大會議决勸吿中日兩國於大會結束後三月或六月以内開始直接交涉、日外務省擬以愼重態度、研究應付此項提議之辦法、然日本决意始終主張中國成立强固中央政府、「滿洲國」存在之事實·及日本承認「滿洲國」之事實等、爲絕對必要之條件、</p>
<p>英報論調不一</p>
<h3>工黨自由黨主張正義獨保守黨報多數袒日</h3>
<p>▲國民社二十一日倫敦電今日倫敦報紙對於日本之李頓報吿意見書、論調不一、保守黨報紙多具袒日論調、其最甚者如保守黨之每日郵報稱其爲極善辯護之文件、足證日人之自有理由又同黨之晨郵報則竟謂日人意見書、苟以不偏不倚之目光細讀一過、將顯然可見日在本法律上與道義上、俱立於較强之地位、諒彼批評日本者亦大半欲承認此言也等語、吾人於此可覘保守黨之態度矣、至自由黨及工黨報紙則均能主張正義、斥日人爲侵略者、如自由黨之紀事報仍稱日本爲侵略者、謂其答辯乃逕行拒絕接受李頓報吿、蓋除日人自己在劍錄下調查所得者、不論李頓調查團之調查結果、或任何其他調查所得、日本均將拒而不受如工黨之每日導報亦具同樣見解、、謂吾人恐將難於設想一更比日本切實侮護頑抗國聯之會員國家</p>
<p>▲路透社二十一日倫敦電克明斯氏在彙聞報評論今日國聯考慮李頓報吿書之會議、謂此爲國聯之最後機會、退出國聯乃日本最不願有之舉、渠料日代表將盡力勸誘國聯容許「滿洲國」試騐之繼續進行、且或將　說一種寬大自由之制度、而以此代替李頓報吿書、國聯將拒絕此種誘惑、而堅持不讓否歟、未可知也、歷時必久之公判今日開始、將判定最重大之問題、即在此新世界中應得勝利者、究爲法治乎、抑爲武力乎云、</p>

<h3>興登堡允希特勒試組新閣但以能得國會多數擁護爲條件</h3>
<p>國家社會黨與中央黨談判開始</p>
<p>▲國民社廿一日柏林電國家社會黨領袖希特勒偕佛理克與戈林、今晨十時半進謁總統興登堡、僅十五分鐘而出、聞談話結果、總統予以六小時期限、令在國會内覓取擁護國家社會黨内閣之大多數議席、以爲組閣根據蓋希氏進見後、即重申其組閣要求、謂國家社會黨拒絕參加他人領袖之内閣總統仍拒絕其請、最後乃予以試組内閣機會、但希氏未完全接受總統條件、答稱、將於下午五時以書面報吿該黨領袖之、内閣、能否在國會獲得大多數擁護條件、說者以爲總統此舉猶非委希氏試組内閣、僅令其試覓能否在國會獲得多數、設希氏未能如願、料將委他黨人物試組新内閣云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十日柏林電國家社會黨與天主敎中央黨之談判、今日已經開始、其目的係按照興登堡總統所擬之計劃、由各主要政黨組織一「國家集中之内閣」、但第一日之談判、顯似未有何種進展云、目前中央黨領袖之態度、爲靜候國社黨先提出條件今日之會議、希特勒並未親自參加、、而由其手下二健將斯德拉塞及戈林二氏代表</p>

<h3>美新聞社對中日問題叙述其過去與推斷其可的結果日國際盜刧罪今日將受世界審判</h3>
<p>外論社云、國聯已定明日討論調查團報吿書當此之時將一年來經過、加以概述、甚爲相宜、但以當事者地位叙述或嫌有主觀之念、適美恩伊愛新聞社有一文、係以第三者之立塲發言行文简潔持論公正、并推斷出可能的結果四條將來取徑、必不出其中之一、該社在美國甚有力量原文譯錄如下、</p>
<p>不滿一年前、日本海軍用長鼻大砲轟擊上海、機開槍隊掃射狼狽之中國街道、更由飛機師投擲炸彈於焚餘之廢墟、以完成死亡與破壞之圖畫、自彼時卽已干犯世界之怒、對　弱的中國之敢抵制日貨施以可怕的實物敎訓之時以後、曾有何事發生乎、在過去數月内、此渺小但有武力侵略野心之島國、已將中國之滿洲富腴省　、侵掠完盡、更在該處設立木偶之「滿洲國」、日本繼續其由征服以圖擴張之政策、已武力奪取中國最富腴之區、丨其大與德往二國合併之而積相等、其鐵路佔中國全部鐵路之半、農礦産之富、爲數無量、爲此項盜竊隣國十選區域之罪、丨被控違犯三大國際條約、日本定於今日國聯在日内瓦開會、受理中國控案時將受世界之審判、但欲使此事明　　回溯去年九月、當時有人（其中尙有一團神秘）毁壞瀋陽城北日本所有之一條鐵路、日本於是侵犯滿洲、一以恢復法律秩序」中國之數萬萬民衆、以其所有之最佳武器、抵抗一强大之軍事敵人、宣布杯葛日貨、此舉實戳中工業日本之經濟心臟、蓋日本之市場、大部份得之於中國也、嗣隨於一月間繼之以上海可怕的實物敎訓、日本所舉之理由謂爲日人生命財産受有危險上海之事不過一烟幕而已因日本之眞正目的、仍在滿洲、後來事實、即爲證明也、</p>
<p>二三月間、美國及其他各國雖努力以求滿洲和</p>
<p>平、日本仍繼續其運動中國非俟犯境之日軍退歸本土、拒絕討論和平條件、此事日本亦拒絕之</p>
<p>五月間、日本發生靑年陸海軍官、從事政治暗殺及投擲炸彈、軍閥力量益增、犬養首相被殺、政府倒台另易新政府、此新政府實僅軍部之工具而已、日陸相荒木、成爲新政府背後之權力、今猶當權也</p>
<p>八　日外相内田宣布認滿洲新國之計劃、命名滿洲國、中國外長羅文幹迅卽回答、謂「日本現已揭開面具、而公然發表　侵略中國之計劃矣、九月、日本正式「承認」其所自造之傀儡國、成立一保證日本現有權利之政府、而以中國廢帝溥儀爲其執政、</p>
<p>日本組織此政府、撰成其憲法、選任其職官、以應問位置各部署、資以金錢、并以强大之軍力捍衛之、斯卽今日之形勢也、</p>
<p>如是、日本以武力擴張之歷史上又著成一賈矣、此事係繼其有侵略心之小國於一八七五年奪取鹿兄島、一八九五年中日之戰中奪取台灣、一九○五年從俄人手上奪取關東（遼東）與薩哈林、及一九一○年最後併呑朝鮮之後而爲之者、國聯大會今日開會時、將有由一無利害關係之中立調查團之報吿書、以供討論、該調查團係國聯於今夏派往滿洲者、李頓調查團之此編報吿候之已久、近始發表、不利於日本、完全拒絕承認日本支配滿洲、且力維中國在該地之宗主權、調查團係英人李頓勛爵爲主席、内美法德意委員各一、美國委員爲麥考益將軍、</p>
<p>美國政府亦同樣拒絕承認日本在滿洲黷武結之果、（日本顯然不甚在意）日本現已得有滿洲、且從方方面面徵示必欲保持之、</p>
<p>從無一國以犯國際盜刦罪被控、受世界審判有如日本之於未來絕巨大會中者、總括而言、其審判當爲日本被控之罪狀、</p>
<p>日本被控違犯三大國際條約、三條約於世界各主要國家、皆有拘束力、日本在每一條約上均曾簽字、此三條約　㈠九國條約、一九二二年華府軍縮會議所簽訂保證中國完整、㈡凱洛格非戰公約、立約各國廢止以戰爭爲國策、㈢國聯盟約、以不用武力解决糾紛之一種工具、規定重訂疆界須互相允許、</p>
<p>日本之辯護、爲一、關於九國公約、日本答辯謂</p>
<p>中國情况已成爲不可能、致鄰國之日本迫得採取行動以保護日本利益、（美國之論據、則爲日本簽約時、已深知中國之不幸情况、情况或有變壞、此一事實、不能用爲違犯之遁辭、）二、關於非戰條約、日本答辯謂日本并未違犯、其在滿洲之行動、乃爲自衛與各主要國家之保留相合、（現將决定日本是否係出於自衛、）三、關於國聯盟約、日本答辯謂並無强奪之舉、滿洲人民離叛中國而自設獨立政府、（日本是否係用此一獨立國以爲强奪中國領土之藉口、爲待决之問題）</p>
<p>可能的結果、㈠國聯可替日本洗罪、撇開李頓報吿書、而掩護日本之滿洲保護國、㈡國聯可命各會員國以道德壓力加於日本、使其放棄滿洲㈢國聯可命各會員國對日本舉行外交經濟及財政杯葛、至日本守約始止、㈣日本可請國聯懸宕、而退出其會員資格繼續對中國爲所欲爲、</p>

<p>▲曁南隊一路居先出人意料、以滬江之威風、上半時竟困居曁南之下、毫無出路曁南許榮水罰中一分黃兆霖射中一球、成三比零繼而九比二、滬江恃馮念華之中的、竭力追上、皆五六分落後直至十三比七後、滬江才追成平手復成十五比十五、上半時滬江於危局中、僅以十九比十七勝二分、</p>
<p>▲黃兆霖遠射驚人上半時之能所以如此接近者、黃兆霖驚人之遠射爲一大原因、半場一記屢屢中的曁南全隊聯絡生疏動作嫌慢、不能向前穿出守衛尙佳、於是全仗黃一人之力上半時曁南十七分中黃得十三、其餘皆不能射籃故機會雖不少而下半時卒敗於滬江、後局黃退攻爲守、於是前鋒力更薄矣、</p>
<p>▲滬江前塲大减色滬江於前半時中、表演大爲减色、先試以接近之傳遞、以困於曁南之圍守、無所施其技擲籃屢射不中、全恃馮念華一人之得分、入後才漸見純熟、下半時曁南擬嚴守、反不如前滬江之擲籃、漸灰復原狀於是二十三比二十一後連得十二分、曁南不能維持、以五十三比三十一失敗、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<h3>在國家憂患中生長着</h3>
<p>— 景記</p>
<p>有人向相老人稱壽，相老人連聲否認道∶！</p>
<p>『年高非眞福，不過多受苦；我在國家憂患中生長着，現在老了，有何可樂？也可以說好人早逝，免得在世間受苦啊！</p>
<p>我幼時便因國家憂患而感受痛苦，記得讀法文通史課本，中有對我國所下評語，譏剌我們這種民族，是無功來呼吸天地間的空氣！我的好老師，常提撕我，爲國努力。</p>
<p>後來長到十八歲時，法領事署欲聘我做秘書，我謝絕說道：「我學法語，爲中國用的！」他們很驚訝，祇好作罷了！</p>
<p>中法訂約時，中方是堅决要有「維持中國的威望」字樣，法方不肯，幾成僵局，那時李中堂（鴻章）便呌我設法使對方就範呢！我在列席會議時‘親詢法方翻譯，何以反對用「威望」他堅决稱「望作希望盼望解」，爲中方太有面子，很不相宜。於是我拿出一部宋版史記，在太史公報任安書，指出「望有怨望」一說。結果，法方翻譯自承說道：「維持中國的威望」算通過了！還央求不要吿訴法代表，保全他做翻譯的「不通中文」一個面子！我自然笑頷答應了。想起往事；還有今日！！唉</p>
<p>日本的維新諸氏，如大隈伯比我要晚出事；我在日本，他請我講演等等：現在我還受他後輩人的欺凌，在國難臨頭的祖國中活着！唉！還有什麽呌做「九五福一曰壽」可掛齒呢！』</p>
<h3>武力政策的濃霜</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>！黃花仍是奮鬥着！</p>
<p>氣候一天寒冷一天，明珠般的露水。已經變成鋼刀般的濃霜了。他厚厚的舖滿了田野，花兒在呻吟，草兒在喊痛，枝頭的小鳥，亦縮着頭頸，替弱小者鳴不平	冷的風，細的雨，寒的氣候；已經摧殘了他們的生命，再加了嚴酷的濃霜，呌他們怎樣掙扎？怎樣忍受呢？</p>
<p>花呀！你萎落吧！草呀！你枯黃吧！要怪你自己力量太單薄，要怪你自己質地太脆弱；你沒有抵抗的精神。你沒有奮鬥的决心；那裏熬得住嚴霜的壓迫侵犯，凌辱，你只好做暴力下的犧牲品了！</p>
<p>籬畔幾株黃花，也給嚴霜重重的壓迫着；他也喊痛他也流淚；可是他不願就此屈服，他不願無條件的萎折；他起來奮鬥，他起來抵抗；他振起不折不撓的精神，放出再接再厲的勇氣∶忍痛，熬苦，吃盡千般酸辛，留得一股義烈。光明的太陽，像公理般的朗照；嚴酷的濃霜，像武力般的消失。奮鬥的黃花，在那靑天白日下，仍是絢爛，仍是欣榮。</p>
<p>全國的人們呀！暴力壓迫，過去方面正給了我們不少的敎訓，我們要做一擊即碎的弱者，還是要做堅忍奮鬥的黃花，請人們選擇一下。</p>
<p>余闔室避兵踉蹌間户亦虚眉，</p>

<p>汝靈於人。不靈於身。我慕玉川。因水作鄰。盆傾瓦碎。幸逃刦火。養氣善藏。仗龜導我。（炸彈落院中，蓄龜盆湓，乃被逃出。）</p>
<p>魚我相忘。莊生悟禪。世外無刦。水中有天。渺茲江湖。清冷可托。在藻依浦。我共魚業。</p>
<p>嗟爾狸奴。兩月無魚。豈但無魚。亦乏餕餘。戀戀寒氈。不出庭户。鼠輩縱橫。藉收吾土。</p>
<h3>中國人難道不能發明麽</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>飛機∶∶∶電影∶∶∶潛水艇</p>
<p>誰都曉得中國是五千多年的古國比巴比侖·埃及·羅馬·印度資格還要老。當然，老大哥的文化，誰都及不來了。或者有人說道∶中國人能夠發明羅盤，不能遠渡重洋，開拓殖民地，只做了風水先生相地的工具“發明了火藥	不能夠來製造槍砲，只做了新年裏兒童放烟火的玩具∶中國人雖說能發明，有甚麽功用呢！我道；不但如此，便是飛機電影潛水艇，我國也早已發明，不過只算了一個神話，未成爲事實吧了！現在請列舉在下面∶</p>
<p>㈠飛機飛機初起是氣球，有熱氣球！很像我國兒童所放的亮燈！輕氣球兩種；在十七世紀，法國蒙氏兄弟方才發明的。至於我國，奇肱氏造了飛車，隨風遠行，後來吹到豫州，湯破其車。過了十年，東風大作，湯復其車。遣之使去。這不是很像氣球麽？韓非子說∶「愚子爲木鳶，三年成飛，一日而敗。」鴻書上說∶公輸般爲木鳶，以窺宋城。飛機不是中國人所發明的嗎？</p>
<p>㈡電影這是從光學原理發明的，有聲電影，近年美人安迪生方才發明的。可是班固漢書說；（武帝夫人李氏死，帝思之。方土齊人少翁	言能致其神，迺夜張燈燭。設帪帷，陳酒肉，而令上居他帪。遙望見好女如李夫人之貌；還幄，坐而步；又不得就視。帝相思悲感，爲作詩曰∶「是邪？非邪？立而望之，偏何姍姍其來遲！」令樂府諸音家絃歌之。」從這叚文字看來，明明是電影了。！其實，走馬燈的製作，便是影戲的濫觴。</p>
<p>㈢潛水艇歐洲大戰時候，德國的潛水艇，橫行海上非常利害。那曉得在二千年前，潛水艇已經發明了。苻案方士王嘉所著拾遺記道；）秦始皇好神仙之事，有宛渠之民，乘螺舟而至；舟形似螺，沉行海底，而水不侵入，一名淪波舟。」這不是今日的潛水艇麽？</p>
<h3>打秋風</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>！也是畸形社會陋習之一！</p>
<p>「打秋風」的原意，固然作何解釋，不甚明瞭，但是照鄙意來講，大約是節令到了一秋」季，快入嚴冬，西「風」凛冽剌入肌骨那時窮人爲了飢寒問題，不得不在富人身上「打」算一番，所以僕役輩拿了經微的禮物，獻媚東家，而得到東家超過物價的賞金	並且還可藉此博得東家的歡心，也許遇事能體諒你，寬恕你，推而廣之，東家的親戚友好之家你如其認識的話，也好去打秋風的，不過打秋風有時間的，逢年過節，或者喜慶喪弔等事爲限，可是從前這們舉動，是僕役對於主人的，現在却不然了	祗要你見過一面，談過幾句的朋友，他家裏有了事，他就會發帖子給你，或者還邀你去帮忙，結果，你不好意思，就要送上一封禮，更有謊謬的人，假借名義廣發請柬，究其實際，並無一些事體，不過藉此收歛一筆大欵‘供他的揮霍而已！這種何嘗不是打秋風的變相嗎？啊！這種畸形社會的陋習，不知何日才可以取消哩。</p>
<h3>短訊</h3>
<p>— 若</p>
<p>招商局監事金廷蓀先生之公子元聲將於月之二十九日結褵，據票界訊，海上除時。代與律和兩票房參加常會外，尙有名藝員梅蘭芳，馬違良，高麗奎，王少檏，及在　之譚氏父子，　艷琴亦加入演唱。聞時代戲碼有法工部局買辦胡方銘之落馬湖，王貫一之鳳凰山，王雅君小姐之别窰，申報記者錢瑞甫之打鼓駡曹，鍾學卿之定軍山，莫愁之黃鶴樓，周杏德之牧虎關，王棟元之六月雪，戲碼殊多精彩。</p>
<h3>死之岔道㈡㈩㈠</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>「妖怪自然是先知啊！知道你不單是請伊喫飯，所以伊推托了。天下有這們便宜，這們容易的事。」</p>
<p>）天地良心！」慕良賭咒着說∶「我絲毫沒有旁的野心，不過想借此和伊談談，探探伊的口氣，可有一些間隙可乘，∶∶∶∶∶∶但是我無論如何不灰心，「錢尺磨做針∶∶∶∶∶∶。」</p>
<p>「好志氣！」韓大少奶冷冷的譏笑他，剌激他他，還要說下去，連三接二的呵欠來了，小鬧鐘滴零零地響了，∶韓大少奶說</p>
<p>「十二點鐘了，我的睡眼時間到了。」</p>
<p>「碎！∶∶∶撲！∶∶∶！　∶∶∶房門開了，廂房裡的掛燈息了，床前的檯燈亮了。」</p>
<p>六從軍去罷</p>
<p>二百塊錢賣掉妻子的劉阿根，和一個剛從江西還鄒的姜牛皮，在翠微村的小茶館裏，促膝長談，聲音講得很低，所以給鄰座上三阿爹酒鬼阿金馮先生們，高談闊論所壓倒，一句也不至引起旁的人的注意。否則一定有許多不相干的批判，和討論，攪亂他們一致的意向，現在他們倆談得十分的投機，一步一步的接近，差不多快要並肩着，不參差的，同步調的，走上一條路上去了。</p>
<p>「∶∶∶這是最好的機會了，我乂乂路軍不肯輕易招弟兄的，尤其是著名柔弱的蘇州人，誰也不要，實在前線死得太多，不能不就地補充一點。」</p>
<p>「不過，我的爺，我的娘，∶∶∶」</p>
<p>「呸！現在這個年頭，還顧得爺娘，田裏收成不好，米糶不起錢，開銷這們大，連妻子都難養呢。」</p>
<p>「唔！∶∶∶」阿根想，我的妻子，正爲了難養，送給人了。不差，死守在鄉間，到老，還是一個窮漢子，爺就是現成的榜樣，但是，有些恐懼，憂慮，說∶</p>
<p>「打仗是性命出入的，儘窮，還活着，有了錢，死了，幹麽？」</p>
<p>「哈！哈！你眞是獃子，沒有上過火線的，自然有這些話了。老實講，現在的打仗，只是子彈晦氣，你看慣了戲台上的牛皐和金兀术了，一個對一個拚命的。我們打起仗來，只是伏在隱蔽的地方，亂放其槍，鬼影子也沒有見	子彈不夠了，就得退下去。眞是死神尋着你了，纔會給盲目的敵方的子彈打着，就是打着，也不一定是死，傷了一部分，更寫意了，睡在傷兵醫院裏，茶，水，粥，飯，都有花也似的看護小姐送來，哈！哈！∶∶∶比公子哥兒都寫意。」</p>
<p>一但是，∶∶∶我總得向爺娘說一個明白。」</p>

<h3>鐵部圈購彭浦民地昨日集議辦法</h3>
<p>▲居民代表昨至市府請願</p>
<p>鐵道部次長曾仲鳴、昨日上午十時、偕同財務司長陳耀祖·工務司長薩福鈞·業務司長兪·（夏光宇未到）至楓林橋市政府、訪市長吳鐵城氏、商洽北車站遷移擴充圈用民地等問題、同時曾氏接見彭浦區被圈村莊代表侯選靑等、茲將經過詳情、分誌如次、</p>
<p>▲會議情形昨日上午十時、鐵道部與市政府、事先約定討論彭浦區居民反對被圈土地問題並實施計劃、到有鐵道部次長曾仲鳴·財政司長陳耀祖·工務司長薩福鈞·市長吳鐵城·公用局長黃伯樵·工務局長沈怡·土地局長金里仁等、集議時先由工務司長薩福鈞·將鐵部所擬聯運站計劃書、以及詳細地圖圖樣、加以說明、繼由市長吳鐵城報吿彭浦區居民請求遷讓情形、後遂由全體交換意見、討論多時結果照所擬計劃、稍加修正、即依計劃開始進行、並决定收用民地、由市政府令土地局組織評價委員會、依照市價估定、最優待標準、給價收買、至十二時始散會、</p>
<p>▲請願避讓昨早、彭浦區被圈村長代表侯選靑等七人、携帶呈文、至市府請願、准予彙案、提交協商會議、其時適鐵次曾仲鳴等來訪謁吳市長、於是該代表等待曾晤吳辭出、向之申訴、大意謂、歷請鐵部避讓圈地、未蒙切實答復等語、當時由曾等在會客室接見、並說明鐵部圈用北站民地、並非目前需用如許地畝、蓋爲五十年　計也原定圈用三千五百畝、因顧全人民生計、特减圈七百畝、並出地圖、指示閘北交通路一帶圈用土地、將來預備將吳淞機房、搬置該處另在附近建機車房·客車房·遷車台·停車塲旅客列車房·運煤機等、用地無從縮减、所以令余（曾氏）等來訪吳市長將來祇有在收地給價方面稍行增高、不予地主虧損、現正擬請市府會同土地局審查該處地價、定級收買、苟必要時、尙可組織收地評價委員會、付諸公評云云各代表以仍無切實辦法、且曾等未便久留、故各代表轉謁市長、</p>
<p>▲呈市府文代表侯選靑等、謁吳市長、並面遞呈文云、呈爲聯運站徵用民地籲請避讓村莊、並予切實答復事、竊兩路聯運站、於彭浦區徵用民地、選靑等以事關國家建設·人民生計·迭經臚列下情、環請避讓在案、惟呼籲月餘、鈞府旣無切實辦法、鐵道部亦未明白指示、殊深惶恐、爲敢再行備文凟請鈞長、俯念民艱准予彙案、提交協商會議、將彭浦區被圈村莊决行避讓、在未確定具體計劃以前、迅令土地局暫行停止測丈、否則民情難平、事態易於擴大、選靑等雖忝居代表、實難負其咎、除面述詳情外、瀝血陳詞、務懇予以切實答復、以慰民心、而蘇民困、實爲德便、謹呈上海市市長吳、彭浦區被圈村莊代表侯選靑·趙友亭·趙文修·張仲祥·侯鏡澄·陶文淵·趙祖炎·同具、結果吳仍囑靜候辦理、</p>
<p>▲曾仲鳴談新聲社記者、昨晤曾氏、叩以對彭浦居民請求遷讓之意見、曾氏云、鐵道部與市政府爲實現大上海計劃、始有此次之更動、其意實在繁榮上海市、爲上海市居民謀福利、所圈地畝、外傳六千畝說不確、實際第一次計劃所圈者、計三千五百畝、嗣因調換事輛關係、復稍有變更、并將交通路以南縮進七百畝、計爲二千八百畝、此一帶土地、將來共擬築機車廠客車列車煤機貨棧等極完備之總站用、并計劃五十年之用、故被圈範圍、實已不能再有更改、惟政府對於收用民地、决定估價收買、事前并先組織一評價委員會、專理此事、其餘房屋種植等物産及建築費遷移費等、均當予以相當補助、决不使人民吃虧、總之、政府一面固爲國家建設地方繁榮計、一面仍處處體恤人民也云、</p>
<h3>日輪漸復舊狀</h3>
<p>▲日人之喜可知</p>
<p>▲國人健忘如此</p>
<p>▲來貨擁擠日貨進口逐漸增多、最近三天中、又有六甲丸·筑波丸·生駒丸·等三船載到東糖五金疋頭海味洋紙水泥等項共四萬五千零六件、値價一百數十萬元、已卸在三菱匯山兩碼頭、另有一部分轉往長江、由日清輪運去、</p>
<p>▲長江定班自一二八至今、十個月來、長江日輪雖在行駛、但無確定船期、其營業亦似有試航狀况、及至十月分起、長江日貨已可公開裝載、日清始攬運客貨近頃上水去貨日多、旅客亦有乘搭該社乃將長江班輪、確定先航四艘、自今晨出口之洛陽丸輪始、規定月駛十二次、每四天開一船、以襄陽丸·鳳陽丸·南陽丸·輪班、上游方面、擬再加一船、</p>
<p>▲海輪起色南北洋日輪、本年受戰事反響、營業衰落已極、十個月以來、任何綫日輪均無貨客、祗航空趟苟無政府補助、早經休航矣、直至最近個月始漸起色、北洋一路日輪貨運、較南華爲佳東北更優、現在行駛大連營口天津至上海者、滿鐵所屬大連汽社、有客船四般貨輪八艘日清與川崎、在靑島天津綫内、有船四艘至於南洋一路、大阪及日清共有五艘、但福州航業、則受抵制、而汕厦去貨已略有運裝、又中日一路、本月起、已有九船往來、進出口貨均已滿儎、已恢復九一八前原狀矣滬上江海各路之日本商輪、今有三十六艘行駛、統計載重有十二萬噸云、</p>
<p>▲東北來貨九月二十五日、我國封鎖東北海關後、大連營口安東雜糧、國人已停止購辦、查十月分、東荳運入我國各埠計二一五三噸、與上年同期比較、減少一萬三千五十一噸、荳油爲四一六噸、較上年十月少四千八百四十五噸、荳餅祇有一噸、上年十月、計有三千六百八十六噸、東北對内地貨運已受重大打擊</p>
<h3>共同委員會尙未結束</h3>
<p>▲滬西尙駐有少數日兵</p>
<p>中日上海停戰協定簽字後、迄已半載、日方尤有少數軍隊、留駐於吳淞公大紗廠及滬西豐田紗廠中、昨日新聲社記者晤市政府參事殷汝耕氏、據談、豐田日兵、業已早行撤退、公大尙有少數憲兵、將於二十八日撤退、惟日官方對於該兩紗廠之撤兵問題之表示、適與上相反被謂公大紗廠駐兵業已撤去、豐田則尙有少數水兵駐在、至二十八日撤退說表示尙未有所聞、此外共同委員會當局以爲雖兩紗廠駐兵全行撤退、該會亦未必即行辦理結束、因彼等尙有其他任務、</p>

<p>▲須有鉅欵始能提高米價</p>
<p>▲且三項困難又必須顧及</p>
<p>▲農行擬有抵押暫行辦法</p>
<p>中央社云、今歲蘇省米穀豐收、糧價慘落、農民銀行爲挽救農村經濟破産於萬一、乃請求上海銀行界與以援助、以濟燃眉之急、而滬上各行、亦因内地經濟之枯竭、備受不景氣之影響、故對農行之請求均允爲援助、昨江蘇農民銀行行長王志莘語記者、滬銀行界對於援助農行、雖已有懇切之表示、但調節糧價、非數百萬元所能濟事、而放欵囤米因倉庫治安等關係、亦恐難期普及、至將來囤米之銷路、亦須考慮及之、故此事雖急不容緩惟爲求實效起見、固須審愼將事也、</p>
<p>▲需欵鉅大現在一般所標榜者、爲調節米價、夫我省江南各縣爲主要之産米區、而江北各縣亦有少數種稻者、故其全部收穫、雖無精密調查、但數量當甚大、卽就無錫一縣而言約有一百萬担以每担五元計、卽須有五百萬元之貸欵以爲積儲之用故欲提高市價非將市塲中全數米糧銷納、始能影響其市價也今以一縣而言即須數百萬元倘更求普遍之效力、其所需欵項之巨愈可知矣、</p>
<p>▲三項困難但此事關係農村之根本、故雖不能得普遍之實效亦須作最大之努力、惟有三項困難必須顧及㈠爲倉庫問題以合理之方法計算之、每倉庫須囤價値五萬元之米糧則其所需經費及利息始數開支普遍每屋一間能容百二十担以每担五元計算則每屋値六百元五萬元卽需屋約百間、故在已設有大規模之倉庫之各縣尙易解决若在未有此項設備之地方一時欲覔百間之巨屋殊非易事、此其一㈡爲担保問題、積載倉庫即經解决而押欵貸金亦有各銀行之資助則在已有倉庫或農民銀行分行或上海各銀行分行者旣經農行與上海各銀行擬有協作放欵辦法、即可按照實行、惟在無上述各設備之縣分其貸金之承受人及其安全之担保乃發生重大問題蓋上海各銀行之貸欵雖非純爲牟利但其本金、當求安全之保障、以免虧折或且全無着落况各行原與農行協作辦理、農行旣無分行且不熟悉各地情况難負全責、故此問題殊難解决此其二㈢爲治安問題上述兩問題完全解决、如至今冬明春、農民若因生活切迫一時激動、致發生搶米之舉、則其責任將屬誰負、蓋此種情形雖爲情理所不許、但爲事實所難免故此項問題更難解决矣、此其三、有上述三難題而亟謀普遍之實效、殊非所奢望、而農行之所以遲遲未作有計劃及大規模之進行者亦乃此故、</p>
<p>▲進行標準雖然農行亦不顧爲過分之欵慮、而忽視其重要之任務、故農行已擬有協助各縣辦理米糧抵押暫行辦法、（辦法見後）分發各縣及各分行、按照辦理以資劃一、在江南蘇·常·錫·等處、則已有與各銀行訂立合同、積極進行者而江北各縣因收穫明較早、故雖亦有已在進行者、但在眞正小農之利益、恐僅少數耳、蓋其間不免小本商人之混入其中也、對小本商人、顧宜亦須救濟惟農行之目的、固在此而不在彼、現在農行因資力有限故先作一部份之押擬儲積以爲將來（明春）農民自身之消費蓋農民於收穫時、每以種種需費、不得已低價脱售及至自身需求之時反爲商人所操縱以高價購食此種情形殊屬不平、農行現在視力所及、先將是項流弊、爲農民謀解脱此即農行以爲進行之標準也云、</p>
<p>▲分行計劃王行長談話時、鹽㙈·如臯·兩農行分行行長單松林·許漢綬亦偕同往訪、報吿該地情况、及對調節米價工作之進行、王行長當將上述調節民食之主旨說明、囑詳擬計劃、以備整個之籌措、</p>
<p>▲抵押辦法江蘇省農民銀行協助各縣辦理米糧抵押暫行辦法㈠本行爲調節民食扶助農村經濟起見除各分行處就原有倉庫加以擴充外、本省産米各縣、如認爲辦理米糧抵押、有需要時得商本行合作、㈡上項協助辦法由擬辦米糧抵押之縣覔得相當房屋推舉負責人員具函通知、並籌足資金成數（至少二萬元）繳存本行然後由本行照收到之數、加充一倍作爲協助資金㈢倉庫成立後農行負出納會計之責地方負管理保管之責、每月報吿一次但爲明瞭手續起見、彼此得隨時查核、以期清澈、㈣收回本息時　應就農行之資金部份、先行歸還、㈤農民向倉庫抵押、照市價以七折計算月息至多不得過一分開支手續等費、得就地方情形酌加㈥農行協助資金、以月息八釐計算、結束時除開支外如有盈餘、歸地方公益之用㈦農民抵押之米、以自産者爲限、抵押手續照本行倉庫規則辦理之、㈧本辦法於二十二年一月以前適用之</p>

<p>私販仇貨屬實先則致函警吿、倘其猶不悛改、乃以炸彈相贈故自七月以來、本市奸商之得到警吿者、實繁有徒、而惲以八月二日晚向法租界民國路茂昌洋貨店投入炸彈後、舉止失愼、致被華界巡警截獲、嗣被法租界捕房提去、解由第二特區地方法院判處徒刑兩月、念其尙未成年、依法</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言信筆書來  吾　　吾生平愛國不敢後人，尤其是對於「共赴國難」更是熱心，所以買布必須到國貨商塲去。昨天吾買了一件呌做什麽絹的褲料，吾非常商興，因爲吾相信這一定是大中華國貨無疑。於是欣然以之示人曰∶　　「你看這幾尺國貨如何？」　　「先生這是國貨嗎？」那人道··「哈哈，你又錯了，這是一半人造絲織成的，人造絲是劣貨，所以你又不愛國了。」　　「哦！原來如此。」於是吾恍然大悟，繼之大發雷霆，决定馬上送回原店，大可以搗毁那欺人的招牌。可是歇了一會兒，吾已慢慢地覺得氣平了許多；「人造絲各國都有，所以不一定是劣貨，何况吾旣經誠心的購自國貨商塲，不已是『盡心焉耳矣』了嗎？」　　乂　乂　乂　乂　乂　　友人勸吾現在趁沒有事做的時候去杭州見識見識，說是「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」，一個人不去杭州一次。那簡直是枉生人世。不錯，言之有理∶吾總是人，而且人生又是如此美滿，「有花堪折直須折」，吾爲什麽不趁現在鬍鬚還沒有滿𩓐子的時候折一折呢？於是孤意已定，就是當了包脚布也要凑足這一筆開支。於是從此眼思夢想∶「啊！西子湖呀！岳王墓呀！英雄兒女！還有那滿有詩意的紅葉！」　　可是包脚布畢竟當不了錢，而且仔細思量，當這「良辰美景奈何天」的時候關外的好男兒，正在冰天雪地裏拚着頭顱∶∶∶這樣一來，吾這棵熱心却又冷了一半。不過吾也滿有理由可說」張少帥不是更熱心愛國的嗎？張少帥不也在西湖嗎？對了，大可以去一去，一方面可以去哭訴岳王吿訴他們咱的國難重重，請他調遣神兵數百萬，再來一次精忠報國，一方面更可以踏着張少師的前跡，學着他的步武勇敢直前。同時當游罷歸來的時候，還可以寫作美妙的游記；假如開頭便寫着「是歲十月旣望，繼張少帥之後作西湖之游」，不是更足以流芳千古嗎？　　嗚呼噫嘻，如此良機，幸勿失之交臂丨　　代郵··玲··要事待商，請示時間地址，俾便趨候。來函請由申報年鑑部陳賡雅轉。吾文藝車行  吳天聲　　老我車聲鬢髮侵，不能避世倍沾襟，且將泥爪窺天意，忍使功名杸此心，世局廻環千刦盡，人間富貴萬機深，霎時一枕黃粱熟，坐困多蹊笑我今，　　訪劍秋不遇　　饑驅十日不能坐，百慮相煎如烈火，世變禍深俎上魚，連橫合縱胸中我全城空拜趙廉　	，愛國誰尊燕漸軻，往者夢魂曾見君，那知今也忽相左但顧目前　奸商　近視　　仇貨常識火爐及其衛生  新萍　　秋去冬來，天氣日漸寒冷，久置不用的火爐，又將爲一般人重視了。　　現在把火爐的種類，和與人生有關緊要之點，分述於後··</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊　　（甲）電爐電爐之生熱，猶如電燈的發光∶當電流通過盤繞在火磚上的金屬絲時，電流受金屬絲的阻力，就生出熱。若温度高，金屬絲細就發出光。所以電爐有時也能發很暗的紅光。這種金屬絲須㈠不會養化。㈡有很大的電阻力。㈢在高温度時不會融化。普通用的是一種鐵和鎳的合金。用電爐取暖，所費較昻，但事實上，頗合衛生∶因無任何氣體或灰屑能汚濁空中空氣。這種火爐祇能用於都市之有電氣供給者。　　（乙）煤氣爐用煤氣爐，也很便利	亦無烟灰但是要知道煤氣是從煤蒸溜而得，常含有一氱化炭炭，炭酸氣，亞摩尼亞，硫化氫等有礙呼吸的氣體，能在燃燒時竄出，混雜空氣中；尤以一氱化炭爲最危險	遴燃爐久之，能致頭昏；兇者窒息致死。實因一養化炭和紅血球化合，成固定的一氱化炭紅血球；因此紅血球停止輸送氱氣。並且這氣體無嗅味，不易覺察，亟宜注意。若固不幸而致窒息，急設法移至空氣清靜處行人工呼吸法蘇醒之。　　用這火爐須常啓窗户，一換新鮮空氣。丨這火爐祇通用於都市之有煤氣供給者，取費亦匪賤。　　（丙）壁爐除了上述二種之外，多用煤作燃料，因其價値低廉，而功効亦大。壁爐常有很大的烟囱，煤燃燒後的烟灰，和發生的各種有礙衛生的氣體，都能儘量的發出∶室中空氣不濁。但烟囱旣大，所生熱力，亦常能從中發散，室中温度之增，亦頗遜之。　　（丁）普通火爐這種火爐可隨意裝置，不若壁爐之呆澀。須另裝烟囱以通烟灰雜氣。爐多由生鐵鑄製，火燄熾時，常見爐壁發紅··這時空氣中的二氱化炭，很容易變成一氱化炭，最好用磁面的爐壁，就無這弊病了。　　美國式的火爐，名Ｓalamander用煤固省，不易燃着，在將燃而未燃時	常有一氱化炭發出，應注意之。　　（戊）火油爐，火盆，煤球爐這三種爐子，都是任意燃燒，沒有烟囱以通烟灰，和燃後的一切氣體；用時略久，室中空氣汚濁不堪，時有窒息昏厥之弊，最好屏除不用以免危險。家庭敎育  天方　　這是星期日偶然拾來的一個不快。當我和Ｃ君從虹口公園出來，在馬路上走得脚有些疲乏時Ｃ便提議到咖啡館裏去喝了一杯咖啡再走。我說也好	於是我倆便成爲某咖啡館的座上客。地點在北四川路。　　當我們走進門時，已有一個日本婦人與一小孩坐在那裏。我們便在旁邊桌上坐下。要了兩客麫包與兩杯牛奶，開始我們種種不相干的談話。談了一會，忽然旁座的那個日本小孩吵起來。了原來那小孩子在吃糖炒栗子，吃完了，吵着向母親要。那婦人朝我們這邊桌上望望，不知是故意的還是無意的。她先不置答那小孩子的要求，她用每個母親所有的和靄，反問那小孩子道「好吃嗎」。孩子答以好吃。她又問丨丨像一個善良的敎師丨丨你知道這種好吃的東西，出在什麽地方，孩子答不知道她說，這是出在支那南部廣東省的。那地方生産好吃的東西眞多啦，不只是這栗子一種，還有香蕉那，林禽那，荔枝那，∶∶：說到這裏，那孩子似還未能忘情於剛才所吃的糖炒栗子，又吵着要。你猜那日婦怎樣安慰那小孩。她說，好孩子，不用吵，等你將來長大起來，把那支那的廣東省奪過來，那你就吃不完了。那孩子聽了這話，似乎得到心理上的滿足，似懂非懂的一時沉靜了，大概他夢想到廣東吃糖炒栗子去了。可是在别座的我聽了，却像吃了一杯冰淇淋，眞想跳過去駡，你們都不是好人‘都是侵略人家的後備軍可是這樣做有什麽用呢，就趕忙同Ｃ君付了錢出來。在路上同Ｃ君談論，不勝感慨。人家從小就無微不至的在灌輸侵略思想，而我國一般人丨中下流社會爲多丨於小孩哭泣時，每多以「外國人來了」，「日本人打來了」等等自餒的口氣來恐嚇他，從小就把愛國心嚇跑了。所以弄到結果，處處要仰洋大人的鼻息。買東西要舶來貨；規劃事業要洋顧問做商意要戤洋商牌頭。總之是「洋」皆寳，惟「國」無名於是由畏而媚，由媚而亡，試問這樣一個奴性十足的國家，還能興得起嗎，　　唉，日本婦人，我佩服你。愛經書後  文炳　　丨略有增補丨　　前在學校裏承一位國文敎師介紹讀過一部最古典的羅馬沃維提烏思著的愛經，昨日檢點書篋，寓目生感，爰草是文，我雖不是和尙，也尙未曾皈依佛法，然爲了環境的榨壓，對於這方面的智識，天然無法需要，可是爲了這書名之特别吸引，還記得當敎師介紹過後，便下意識的走到水沬書局，化了八角大洋，把它買了回來，一看錢君匋的裝幀，就很雅緻奪目，拿在手裏細讀，忘却了一頓夜飯，晚上電燈息了，繼續廢了半枝洋燭·算是精細地讀了一遍·所得印象如此··的確不錯，與其說是一部愛經，不如說它是部靑春期男女心理學譯文也很美麗，只是古典太多，頗難記憶，前半部寫男子怎樣向女人求愛	一言以蔽之曰··「體貼入微」，後半部寫女人應如何冶裝，裝嬌，刺探對方等等，還記得其中有這麽一句··「女人千萬不要去愛每根頭髮都有一定位置的那種男子，」這說話確來得九分刁巧，就其全部看來，總是說的「爲戀愛而戀愛」，大概是囿於時間與空間，在咱們貴國裏，似乎不切實用，因而略有增補。　　第一，中國的戀愛，須建立於金錢，因之更要牽涉到權勢	凡有權勢的人，大抵都有幾個錢男的有錢，好進洋學堂，充分地洋化，女的有錢，嬌養深閨，自然娉婷婀娜，不可嚮邇，這樣，才配讀戀愛，戀愛才容易發生，否則根本讀不上，窮人與窮人相好，鄉下人名之曰「偷人」，文雅點說是「通姦」，在上海呌做「軋姘頭」，都不是戀愛。　　第二，中國的戀愛，絕對的有階級性，換句話說，就是要門户相當，比如部長的女兒與院長戀愛	同是做官階級，那很配稱，師長的閨秀與軍長發生曖昧，同是有槍階級，也很調合，苟不然者，便要惹得社會人士的非議，所以×主席的女兒愛上了馬弁××，事便希奇，×主席窘得驚惶萬狀，只好快拿巨欵，把那馬弁送到×奴國去游玩幾月，回來給他一席師長位置，於是馬弁的階級升高了，×主席也就公開地把女兒送給他，陸根榮與黃慧如的戀愛，因爲是主僕關係，大家總認爲是希奇的事，前年某校有一位學生愛上了茶房的女兒，報紙也要大書特書，爲的是門户不相當，這在西洋，却並非如此這般。　　第三，中國的戀愛‘要偷偷摸摸，女的固然是羞答答地不作表示，男方也總是鬼鬼祟祟，當通情書的時候，總是文不對題的說··「什麽你的才學很好、我很願意做你一個忠心朋友，」見面時，又總很少勇氣正式提出·這在現代的西洋則不然，旣經愛戀，便冠冕堂皇的求婚，這原是吃飯一樣平凡的事體‘偷偷摸摸幹什麽。　　第四，中國人的戀愛，其重心應移至戀愛成功以後，其在初戀時，如漆似膠，及至結婚，也還卿卿我我，似魚水之相得，只是時日積久，彼此弱點暴露，便難免漠然起來，於是分居，離異，悲劇，都弄出來了，每日報紙上關於這類的記述，不知佔去多少篇幅，什麽律師代表啓事，法院開庭記當事人的聲明等等，所以我覓得中國人的戀愛，其重心不在追求時期，而在結婚以後，須要彼此諒解	以維繫「愛」的永恒，免在中途發生破裂	　　這幾條在愛經裏是，找不出來的，我偶然想到，便提筆增補起來，以供靑年男女的參考·若想對「戀愛」這種藝術，獲得深刻認識·那還是請去讀「愛經」，老實說，本文並非爲此而作。好個寒風起後天  徐本熙　　丨上海都市拾零丨　　不用說	上海因爲是上海，都市也畢竟是都市，所以經過了清高偉大之秋後，雖則寒風照樣地接着會怒吼可是生活在上層階級裏的上海人，却因天時的推移，更有着極尖銳的顯著，這情形，無疑地，完全忘遺了去年此時緊張熱烈的象徵·不過呢，東北義勇軍並不會像上海人要漂亮，他們竟因爲自掘墳墓的不可靠而作民族的呼聲，天南地北，如此這般！　　香檳票開獎的結果，大概又破了不少財迷的幻夢，幻夢裏的洋房，汽車，嬌妻，艷妾，當然也隨之而歸泡影·不過善於自圓其說的上海人會這樣說··「十塊錢至多少上兩次館子，明年春季大香賓，何嘗不可染指？」哈丨自譬是多麽好的人生哲學？無怪乎東北三千萬民衆要活受罪哩！　　少男們是厚呢大衣羊毛襯衫·少女們是皮大衣，年牽手地跨進電影院，欣賞着閒適，享受了温暖，這是多麽富於理想？多麽使人艷羨？的確，上海都市因爲享樂主義者之多，被遺棄的低級羣衆的生活也愈苦，不過充其量，享樂僅不過時代的尾聲而已·　　一說是今年市面低落··二說是今年商業凋敝此言也，欺鄉下阿土生則有餘，騙上海人則絕對不足，理由是馬路上飄飄其旗擠擠其人者，已由秋季大减價而直連至冬季大减價·供求旣都旺盛，市面之衰何來？商業之敝何指？聰敏的旁聽者說··這就是大老板發善心，忍痛周濟平民的·小子聞之，不禁額手稱慶者再·街頭把戲  薄萍　　前天我走過中虹橋附近，看見了一幕街頭把戲，我覺着它的黑幕，有揭破的必要。現在特地把它寫在下面；拆開看一香烟包裏有鈔票！要嬴鈔票大家來！買券時間還只有二十分鐘！要買快地來，一陣陣曳長的聲音，從馬路旁黑越越一羣人中逸出來，同時又夾着銀洋角子的響聲·又是什麽把戲，好奇心的驅使，我也加入了人羣中，這是一家烟紙店的灘櫃，上面放着不少貯滿香烟的盒子！排疊成一個寳塔式。烟盒外面，貼着幾張嶄新的伍元鈔票，算是號召的廣吿吧！眼望人家化了兩角錢，買了五包香烟，拆開來裏面藏着的支票，一共値洋伍元，（支票用來換鈔票的）多麽好運，使圍觀者的眼紅，這時買票只有十五分鐘了，要買快地來···的聲音，和得彩者的歡聲，不住地響着，多誘惑的聲音，打動了不少觀客的心‘一個好像商人的寗波阿拉，在擁擠人羣中，擠入了店内買了四角錢的票，換了十包香烟。包有彩嗎丨沒有彩怎樣？當他手接香烟的時候很鄭重地問着保你有彩，沒有彩包換丨受他問的店員，大聲地答着，他的意思是想給觀衆聽到的，怎麽沒有？怎麽沒有？當他連接將十包香烟拆開後，很失望的問着，你再給我一元丨這裏包你有彩，另一個店員按上說着，另一面把滿貯二十五包香烟的盒子，放在他面前的櫃上	一下又一下的連注兩角！四角！六角！一元，在他的袋裏拿出來，後來總算得到四元五角的支票一張，計算除去以前的數，還有幾角可贏，可是一來卻給他出乎意料之外，當他將支票拿去換銀的時候，那管銀的呌他靜待到收市之後來換，你們是滑頭的嗎丨啥事體銅鈿不換把人家，當他始覺上當很失望地問那店員，你鬧什麽，不換給你怎樣；一個白相人打扮的說，大家爭論了一會，終於一共上了附近××茶樓講道理去談論了半天，最後勝利仍屬阿拉，他失了三元六角和半日大爭論，結果只得了幾下耳光和拳頭，大約算是四元五角的代價，當他重走過的烟紙店的門前，又有一大羣大圍着，他，好像明白衆人的心理。正想有得彩的幸運</p>

<p>電影專刊電影專著表示心痛偏像牙痛  陳大你現在不妨馬上就在鏡子面前試一試哭的表情·再試一試怒的表情再試一試驚的表情·面不改變呼吸的速一度。你看成績如何？，你的哭是不是有一點兒像哭？你再把你的眉頭擠緊些，眼皮閉攏些，唇角下垂些·甚至於連眼淚都擠了出來，你的哭終究不能像眞的哭。你要表示心痛，結果偏偏像是牙痛。你的怒容只怕也有一點兒近於滑稽，這種怒容在遊藝塲裏的文明戲或是哈哈戲台上也許是很用得着的。因爲看那些戲的人其目的無非是取樂而已。你這樣滑稽的怒容能夠供給他們一次捧腹的哈哈大笑，他們就很知足滿意的了。但是看銀幕戲的人却不是那樣的容易欺騙。他們要看像眞的一樣的怒容，方稱滿意。，’驚的表情亦復如是。如果不在呼吸方面先立下了根基，你把上眼眶睜得再大些，眉毛抬得再高些上下嘴唇離得再遠些，充其量也不過像你要敎人吃一驚，而不像你自己吃了一驚。現在你再換一個方法試一遍這三種簡單情緒的表現。你在未做哭的表情以前，先把你的呼吸改爲非常的短促，胸部一起一落。好像還是喘不過氣來。你先皺緊了眉頭，連續的吸進極短的三四口氣，由你那個張開的嘴送進氣管裏去，却沒有餘力呼出氣來。這樣的把氣一逼，你在鏡子裏看你的哭是不是比較的眞一點？再用呼吸來帮助你的怒容。憤怒俗稱動氣亦稱生氣。不受氣的壓迫，誰也怒不起來的。你對鏡中的你逼住了一口氣，向他咬牙瞪目，怒容馬上就會逼眞起來了。國際珍聞嘉寳輟演之眞相  思沛　　爲了十萬元竟絕裾而去在今年的春天。葛萊泰嘉寳和米高梅影片公司五年演戲契約滿了。當時公司當局曾派代表同她接洽繼續訂約。答應給她每週一萬五千元美金的豐肥薪俸。同時並提出條件要求她每年擔任多演幾部影片。嘉寳以爲表演影片是一件極不易而精研的技術倘鎭日價對着鏡頭演劇。粗製濫造。那麽出品量的方面當然增多了。公司當然盈利受惠了。但’影片本身藝術。因沒有充分的預備和研討。當然比較得遜色了。由此會影響到她已得的榮譽。所以她對於擔任多演幾部影片的要求。根本反對。她表示每年限制祇主演二部影片。每片享受三十五萬元的酬勞。即是按年得七十萬元薪俸。經幾度劇烈的爭執和商議。公司方面始决定贊同嘉寳每年主演二部影片的提議。但薪俸方面。却堅持最多酬她六十萬元一年。爲了十萬元鉅的差額。雙方都再也不甘讓步。併成了僵局。於是神秘的嘉寳。竟拂然一怒。到初秋即買棹歸國。暫時脱離了演員生活地的好萊塢。同時好萊塢便像昏黑的夜晚失掉了一顆明珠。黯淡凄凉得多了。本埠消息「如此英雄」的前奏曲  吉仲　　中國的電影界，雖然也已有相當的歷史，可是帶有滑稽性質的影片，簡直是百無其一。數年前雖曾有開心公司一度的極力提倡，但藝花一現，不久即歸消沉。的確我們很知道，滑稽片是最難攝製的。電影事業發達若好萊塢，也難有令人滿意的滑稽片。顯赫如羅克，一班人還苛刻的說他胡鬧呢，在中國當然談不到。　　在最近，聯華的第四製片塲主任但杜宇，忽然有一些創造，新局面的宏旨，「失足恨」中的迷霧鏡頭，也就是他勇於　試力的表掦終於在他這種的心理之下，整本的滑稽片「如此英雄」，毅然的攝製了。　　導演是老但自任，主演是劉繼羣韓蘭根，女角是談瑛。在沒有攝成以前，這裏不願去詆毀與誇張。不過我們從這二個一肥一瘦的角色，在過去的成績中細味一下，那末這一次或者不致於十二分的失敗吧。遺聞軼事  堯廷㈠一捲電影底片的第一次代價，是美金兩元半。那是大發明家愛迪生氏，在一八八九年，九月二日付給柯達公司的。㈡在三十年前，華納兄弟公司，第一次建設一個呌「茄斯蓋特」Ｃascade的電影院，在紐茄塞爾Ｎew_castlr鎭上。院址是一個舊的堆貨物的棧房，可容九十九個看客。那戲院裏的椅子，是向鎭上的喪事代辦所租借的，遇到鎭上有大喪事，那末觀衆祇好立着看了。㈢一九二二年，「亂世孤雛」在美京華盛頓公映時，著名導演葛雷菲士，Ｄ·Ｗ·Ｇriffith和麗琳甘許姊妹，Ｌillian　andＤorothyＧish被大總統哈定夫婦請到白宮裏者晏會。那是電影界的人第一次進白宮。國片介紹李萍倩新片完成  嘯谷自李萍倩脱離天一，轉入明星之後，第一部歸他導演的便是「舊恨新愁」。這的戲的情節，以男女之愛爲出發點，結果是造成了作繭自縛的　痛，布局非常曲折離奇，使導演者得盡量發揮其巧妙手腕。劇中的主角是艾霞龔稼農和孫敏朱秋㾗，這幾位都是於表演的名角兒，李氏更能得心應手，達到其理想中之目的。現在全片已完全結束，昨晚在中央大戲院正式試演。明星公司在本月份，預定有三部新片出演，「舊恨新愁」便是其中之一，不久就要在本外埠公演。舊恨新愁中的一幕影界掌故歌塲魅影和郎地乃  孟「歌塲魅影，」是法國神怪兼浪漫派小說家「李洛克斯」ＧastonＬeroux的一部生平傑作。當「郎却乃」的成功作「鐘樓怪人，」未公映之前，環球公司之經理「卡爾萊曼爾」，就得到這部劇本，但是因爲劇中佈景的偉大，主角的難覓亦曾擔擱過很久的時候。到「鐘樓怪人」公映以後，「郎却乃獲到偉大的成功，被譽爲千面人，於是「萊曼爾」就立刻選定「郎却乃」擔任劇中主角依立克，而由「腦門開萊」與「曼麗菲立濱」配演。同時開工建造劇中的「巴黎歌劇塲」佈景，高七十五尺，闊一百尺，而塲底之地道，亦按照書本築五層，而末層亦爲洪水冲沒，與巴黎該塲眞景無異。全部佈景，經過十個月，方始造成。劇中「墮燈」之一幕，曾試攝八次之多，而該巨燈之重量有一萬數千磅，能壓死數百人。郎却乃在「鐘樓怪人」的化裝，博得世人的驚嘆和崇拜∶在「歌塲魅影」裏，他更得到藝術上的成功。劇中有一千多尺片子，「郎却乃」朦沒面部，純以兩手來表演，而沒有絲毫破綻。這寳在是難能可貴的事。恐怕除郎氏以外沒有第二人能繼絕響的了。最可惜的，是去年環球公司重將該片翻成有聲片的時候，郎氏却罹疾身亡，沒有將他的怪聲收入。這是使人最抱憾的。但是郎氏雖然身亡，他遺留的藝術是永久生存的了（却酬）意見陳述要求添設中文字幕  娜夫在默片時代不懂英語的人們，還可得到解畫人的解話，但到了聲片時代不懂英語的觀衆就很吃虧，爲的是一般影戲院沒有中文字幕，上海的西片影戲院就有這個情形。講到上海的影戲院，他們對於裝飾和影片都很注意但至於中文字幕他們就忽略了。同時說明書内的中文：也只是很簡單的翻譯出來就算，可以說是沒有詳細的中文說明書。這兩點就是上海西片影戲院的缺憾。我們要知到，看西片的人未必一定懂英語的，或者稍懂英語的也未必聽得懂，如果全不懂英語的就更不堪其苦了丨因此，有時遇着多對白的片子，看完不明白内容的常見，這樣看來，看者自然失去好片的眞價値，同時會失却電影知識的普遍性，而且對於營業方面或因此會受影響，最少會少去不懂英語的觀衆，這樣我實在替電影院可惜。然而我希望映西片的影院，把這個缺憾補救起來，補救的方法∶自然是另外設開中文字幕，說明書内增加之文的篇幅，或者把對白詳細譯了出來，使得不懂英語的觀衆也能領會到西片藝術的滋味。這是我給西片影戲的貢獻。短期的夫婦  靄露絲却透呑ＲuthＣhatterton，和喬治勃蘭特ＧeorgeＢrent的結婚消息一宣佈，好萊塢就起了很大的紛論，多一半人就說她們是早就相愛了。不過婚禮吿成以後，不到二十二小時，他們就在ＲalphＦorbes，處，得到了離婚的判决書。這一來，大家才呆了，謠言亦立刻就平靜下去了。故土的重遊心亞道夫孟郁ＡdolphＭenjou，演完了Ｆarewell　to　Ａrms，一片以後，他却把第二片的主演犧牲了。因爲在這時間，他要去游歷，現在已經到紐約去了，不久他再從紐約渡過大西洋，去看看他的故鄉，和巴黎的繁華。好一個「大信桶」  靄喬治羅夫特ＧeorgeＲoft並不是出大名的大明星，但是同耐茜卡洛ＮＣarroll，合演ＮightＡfterＮight，之後，忽然受了絕大的觀迎。派拉蒙收信員證明他一天得的信比任何收信最多的明星，還要多出四倍呢！影界瑣聞美國明星的敎育程度  歐陽錦屏女士說起了電影明星的程度，却也在銀壇上佔了最重要的一個地位。除非你的熱烈的表情，像葛雷泰嘉寳一樣的動人，史璜遜一般的妖艷，那末大學畢業的一張證書，是極有用處的。「請你快到學堂裡混上幾年罷。現在的影壇裡，至少要經過大學敎育的歷程的。待你學成後，再來見我，也許未遲啊」。這是一個摩登的交際之花想入電影界裏，給考侖穆亞拒絕她的懇求而婉謝她的說話。所以明星的程度，多數是受過高等的敎育的；想成功一位明星，談何容易。却利卓别嶙是一所義務小學堂裏讀出來的；葛雷泰嘉寳僅在瑞典皇家戲劇訓練學堂補習過兩年；史璜遜連初中還沒有畢業；曼麗畢克馥是舞臺劇出身；這幾位憑着他們底天資和技術。却未可一概而論。范朋克氏出身哈佛大學；「女容院」的男主角，是加利福尼亞大學士；凱琳茂萊在Ａlabama大學的時候；被電影公司聘了去；凱佛蘭絲是巴黎大學的校花；史寳塞德尼茜在普林司登大學當過體育指導；潘奇沙侖和瑪麗安妮遜都是法國ＬeＥtoia學院的同學；電影皇帝却爾斯法雷曾在威斯康新大學習過琴科。其他如魯韋里斯是Ｌake學院畢業生；傑姆斯登是Ｈighland大學學士却利士；畢克馥是麻省大學的工程科高材生；尼爾芙巴蘭梅和安德尼史密斯在聖法蘭西斯學院裏充級任員。眞的電影界裏的大學出身的人才；何止恒河沙數；那些未成名的演員攝影師導演師，至少佔十分之六是大學畢業生。公開書啓吉仲君鑒∶　蒙惠寄本埠新聞，俱已儘量披露，尊作「行走在人生大道∶∶∶」字數雖過多，然不妨寄下一閲∶如附有回件郵資，不合用即當原件奉趙。編者白明星小史珍妮蓋諾的自述（下）  冰其後，福克司公司在ＪohnstownＪldod裏，需要一位配角。那張片子是喬治奥勃靈和法勞倫吉爾勃合演的，他們擬定了我。最使我生平不能忘懷的一個人，是伊文克明司。這和靄的導演，竭誠地愛護我的工作。因此我得到了每週百元的薪水。旣而穆納導演「日出」的時候，有許多女明星，都想在這大導演家的製作下，希望担任這張片子的主角，而穆納郤注意到了我，呌我主演。在ＴheＲeturn　of　ＰeterＧrimm一張公演後，卜柴又選定我担任七重天的主角。關於「七重天」，是我和郤利法雷合演的第一張作品。我是永不會忘掉的，當此片在卡賽戲院公演的時候我是躑躅往來着，	聽到了許多觀客的讚美。現在讓我來吿訴我自己吧！我常愛買東西。我也愛跳舞。但我絕少參與公共宴會，因爲我覺到每個人似乎都認識我，我不會駕駛汽車，這恐怕在加利福尼的女子中是很少見的我自己以爲這是胆小的緣故，但我郤不怕水，很愛游泳。我的高而夫球也打的不差，近來且又學習網球。我有一些迷信，就是我在工作時候所穿的鞋子，必穿着那在「七重天」的一雙。（完）</p>

<h3>Feelings Arising from the Jardine Matheson Case</h3>
<p>The recent case of Jardine Matheson pledging its four warehouses has already drawn significant attention from society. There is general public consensus as to who should be held responsible for this case and how it should be handled. I am unwilling and see no need to further comment on this matter. However, I have many feelings inspired by this incident, which I will now share.</p>
<p>Firstly, Jardine Matheson has a history of sixty years since its founding. Foreign shipping companies established at the same time have all made remarkable progress. Yet, Jardine Matheson has not only failed to expand in these sixty years but has also declined steadily, relying on debt to sustain its remaining breath. This year alone, it has already suffered a loss of over 1.7 million yuan. As a result, the shipping industry is increasingly declining, and shipping rights are being increasingly infringed upon. The impact extends beyond Jardine Matheson itself nearing its end, also inflicting a tremendous blow to the development of transportation and industry and commerce throughout the country. There are numerous reasons for this, but the "lack of a sense of responsibility for safekeeping" is one of the most important.</p>
<p>According to the "Report of the National Government's Committee for Clearing, Managing, and Reorganizing Jardine Matheson," "From 1922 to 1926, the total amount of losses over the years was more than 4.37 million taels. However, the total amount of salaries and rewards issued to employees by the Shanghai General Office each year totaled 245,994 taels over five years. Since 1923, shareholders have not received a penny of interest, yet the employees of the office exclusively enjoy this generous remuneration."</p>
<p>It also states, "The total repair costs are approximately 600,000 to 700,000 taels per year...and the Inland River Factory (undertaken by the office) accounts for the largest share, approximately half of the total amount. In 1926, the total repair cost of the Inland River Factory was more than 314,000 taels...Since the Inland River Factory is an affiliated branch of the bureau, the internal staff naturally have close relationships with the bureau's staff...The committee requested to review the account books, but the factory suddenly reported that the accountant had disappeared and the account books were lost. The situation within is self-evident."</p>
<p>Based on the two points mentioned in the above-recorded report, it is clear that the "lack of a sense of responsibility for safekeeping" is the greatest long-standing problem of Jardine Matheson. Because of the lack of a sense of responsibility for safekeeping, various malpractices such as embezzlement, fraud, self-enrichment, irresponsibility, and blurring the lines between public and private interests arise. The current case of pledging the four warehouses is just one scene in the manifestation of these malpractices. Former Commercial Counselor of the American Embassy, Mr. Jernigan, once said in his book "Some Fundamental Questions in China" that "the concept of responsibility for safekeeping, no matter how hard one tries, cannot establish its stable meaning among the Chinese...This problem manifests in various forms, deeply rooted and widespread." Mr. Jernigan's words should serve as a warning for us to reflect. The occurrence of the case of pledging the four warehouses is a powerful proof of Mr. Jernigan's words. However, if we silently observe the manifestations of irresponsibility and blurring the lines between public and private interests in the present, is it only the case of Jardine Matheson pledging the four warehouses? We can also know that the occurrence of the Jardine Matheson case of pledging the four warehouses is by no means accidental. The root of the problem is deep and has been around for a long time. A thorough investigation of the case of pledging the four warehouses is absolutely necessary. But how to remove this deeply rooted problem is even more crucial.</p>
<p>Secondly, bureaucratic politics is the biggest obstacle to China's political system getting on the right track. To this day, the essence of this kind of politics has infiltrated various departments. No matter whether it is a public or private enterprise, it has infiltrated and taken over multiple positions, remotely receiving sinecures, excluding dissidents, and installing personal favorites. The so-called "one person attains enlightenment, and even chickens and dogs can ascend to heaven." The so-called "a new emperor, a new set of officials." The essence of various bureaucratic politics is clearly exposed everywhere. Although Jardine Matheson is a commercial enterprise, those who have grasped its real power over the years have mostly been frustrated bureaucrats and politicians. Therefore, it has been held hostage by bureaucratic politics for more than a day. Furthermore, because it has been losing money year after year and is not valued by people, cunning individuals have even used it as a den for embezzlement and fraud. This back-and-forth, multiplicative bad habit has also been around for more than a day. The pledging of the four warehouses today is just a repeat performance of decades of bureaucratic politics. To put it in a broader and more distant perspective, the fundamental way to eliminate corruption and support integrity lies in eradicating the foundation of bureaucratic politics.</p>
<p>Alas, "The world is bustling, all for profit; the world is hustling, all for gain." Drawing from Laozi's words, we can see that humans have selfish desires, and this is no different from ancient times. However, who can have the great power to make people have no selfish desires? Does the answer lie in a thorough transformation of the psychology? Or does it lie in the gradual improvement of social systems? Therefore, we attach great importance to the case of pledging the four warehouses. We especially value the significance of the occurrence of the case of pledging the four warehouses and its origins. The past is gone. Let us pay more attention to the future.</p>
<h3>The Diplomatic War Begins</h3>
<p>Tension Suddenly Rises in the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Convened a Meeting Yesterday to Hear the Opinions of the Two Parties</p>
<p>Matsuoka Wildly Slanders Our Country, While Gu Weijun Refutes Point by Point with Reason; the Right to Resolve the Dispute Lies with the Special Assembly; Japan Considers Discussion in the Executive Yuan to Be Advantageous</p>
<p>▲ Nationalist News Agency, Geneva, 21st: The League of Nations Executive Yuan convened a meeting today in a tense atmosphere to consider the Lytton Report. Chairman de Valera announced the opening of the meeting at 10:20 this morning in the hall of the National Hotel (the location of the League of Nations Secretariat). Chinese representative Gu Weijun was on his right, and Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke was on his left, seated on either side of the horseshoe-shaped conference table. Each representative had a copy of the Lytton Commission report in front of them. This is the result of months of investigation by Lord Lytton, Sir Murdoch, General McCoy, Major General McCoy, and Dr. Sidney, who unanimously agreed. The League of Nations hopes to find a way to return Manchuria to China while still preventing the Japanese from withdrawing from the League of Nations. The diplomatic personnel, journalists, and the public in the audience were all packed.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 21st: The League of Nations Executive Yuan held a special meeting this morning to consider the Lytton Report. The meeting was very crowded. Lord Lytton and other members of the commission were seated in the audience. Chairman de Valera briefly described the origin of the Lytton Report, praising the work accomplished by the commission, calling the report a bright document that is gratifying and exciting. He especially thanked Lytton and others. De Valera then recounted the proceedings in this dispute and mentioned the actions of the League of Nations General Assembly in establishing the Committee of Nineteen. He then invited Japanese representative Matsuoka to state his views, while declaring that the afternoon meeting would give the Chinese representative the same opportunity. At 11:40, Japanese representative Matsuoka began to speak. What he stated was nothing more than an outline of Japan's opinion, saying that the Lytton Report as a whole, especially the narrative section, provides valuable factual truth. Moreover, several sections are completely consistent with the Japanese government's views. The Japanese are willing to express their sincere gratitude for the work of the Lytton Commission. However, after long-term research, they feel that the deduction is quite inappropriate. Therefore, we have prepared some opinions for the League of Nations Executive Yuan to consider and hope that the Executive Yuan will give full consideration to these opinions. Japan cannot agree with the optimistic attitude towards the future of China in the report. In fact, the situation in China is worse now than it was at the time of the Washington Conference. In the past, China did not have the Red Peril; now, Chiang Kai-shek is personally suppressing the communists. However, the National Government and the Kuomintang still do not abandon their principles of several years ago, which caused foreign governments to increase their garrison troops in Shanghai. Since the Kuomintang adopted radical ideas, China's relations with foreign countries have made no progress. The National Government is filled with anti-foreignism and tirelessly works to cultivate a hatred of foreigners in young people. China's 50 million children are developing under the influence of intense ideology, which is a terrible problem in the near future. Japanese in China have suffered years of resistance and are now being used as a tool of national policy in order to achieve the abolition of foreign treaty rights. The powers made treaties to stop acts of war.</p>
<p>I will ask the Executive Yuan why the League of Nations does not condemn boycotts of an official or semi-official nature but considers them acts of war? The Lytton Report reveals a sense of hatred towards Japan in several places, but this is not the case. The Japanese government is convinced that the Chinese people are being misled, coerced, and misunderstood in their opinions. The Japanese government knows that the main desire of the Chinese people is to enjoy peace and the results of their labor. Japan is now maintaining its old friendship and expects a period of prosperity and friendly cooperation between the two countries. Matsuoka mentioned the section in the Lytton Report that stated that the damage to the railway near Fanyang on September 18 was not a reason for military action. He said that this outbreak, in itself, was not very important, but the report did not detail the serious background of this situation. If this matter had occurred at another time, and not in such a tense situation, then the commission's opinion would be correct and reasonable. Japan cannot accept the commission's conclusion that the military action on the night of September 18 cannot be considered a legitimate self-defense plan. Matsuoka went on to cite a document from Kellogg on June 23, 1928, which stated that the right to self-defense is endowed to any sovereign state and is also implicit in any treaty. Matsuoka then cited a motion passed by the US Senate when approving this treaty, which stated that the implementation of the right to self-defense should actually extend beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the state exercising the right to self-defense. Matsuoka also cited two letters from British Foreign Secretary Chamberlain on May 19, 1928, and July 18, 1928. The British government stated in the first letter that it believed that the clauses of the US draft treaty did not preclude the actions of a country forced to defend itself and declared that Britain would not allow foreign interference in any region where its welfare and integrity had a special relationship with Britain's peace and security. The second letter stated that this treaty in no way restricts or impairs the right to self-defense, but that the state itself has the qualification to consider the environment and adopt a war of self-defense. Matsuoka continued, stating that the Japanese government, in view of the above-mentioned clear reservations, recognizes that its military action is an act of self-defense. This right is not questioned or denied by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which is something that people understand clearly. The reasons why Japan did not submit the Manchurian issue to the League of Nations are as follows: (1) Public opinion does not allow foreign intervention; (2) The procedures of the League of Nations will inevitably take a long time, which may greatly damage the status of Japanese residents in Manchuria; (3) During the debate by Westerners, the situation may change dramatically, and the hope of the Japanese to resolve it may be prolonged for too long; (4) When the incident broke out, it followed its natural course. He did not recognize the statement that Manchuria is an integral part of China. No Chinese government that has been recognized has ever had jurisdiction over Manchuria. He expressed sympathy with the commission's statement that restoring the status quo would not be satisfactory, but he completely disagreed with the commission's statement that maintaining the status quo would also not be satisfactory. The establishment of "Manchukuo" seems to be the only possible solution, which is why Japan recognized it. Any other solution other than this, without waiting for implementation, would be seriously disruptive to the overall situation in the Far East, and the existing confidence in "Manchukuo" would be shaken by this, and China's attempts to disrupt it would be even more active. The Japanese are determined not to join this kind of consideration. The Lytton Commission questioned the authenticity of the independence movement in the three northeastern provinces. It should be known that the organization of "Manchukuo" was not initiated by the Japanese but was based on the Manchurian people's desire to break away from Zhang Xueliang. It seems that the commission did not pay attention to much of the information it obtained about this matter. Japanese civil and military officials are not allowed to participate in the plot to establish a new political system in Manchuria. What he regretted was that the commission seemed to accept the reports provided by Zhang Xueliang's side and did not pay attention to the statements of the officials of "Manchukuo." To give an example, the amazing progress of "Manchukuo," such as the financial budget, has never been seen in the report. As for the unrest in Manchuria today, it is not caused by China's assistance. Its Gu Mingzhi's purpose is to express dissatisfaction to the Western world. It would be unfair to blame Japan for what happened in Manchuria. If only Manchuria had proper rule in the whole of China, and the Japanese could be spared from the intentional destruction of their lives and rights, then why would there be any change? Our act of self-defense was natural and automatic, and when we acted in self-defense, the independence movement also broke out on its own. At this point, Matsuoka took the Battle of Navarino in Greece as an analogy. The occasional shooting and the retaliatory counterattack established Greece's independence. Matsuoka continued, stating that Japan is not responsible for the results in Manchuria. The responsible parties are China and Zhang Xueliang's government. This is the result of their own actions and has nothing to do with Japan. Their actions violated Japan's repeated warnings. Japan has not violated the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, or the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Please, the League of Nations Executive Yuan, calm down and give China the generosity and patience, and give Japan a little. Japan does not want to go to war with other countries, nor does it want to expand its territory. Japan is not an aggressor. The Japanese deeply and sincerely hope that their great neighbor can enjoy well-being.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 21st: The League of Nations Executive Yuan's meeting this afternoon started a little late because Dr. Gu Weijun was a little late to the meeting. It is heard that Dr. Gu's speech was half pre-prepared, and the rest was to answer Matsuoka's remarks this morning.</p>
<p>(Geneva) Our representative Gu Weijun gave a speech at the League of Nations Executive Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 21st, vehemently refuting the points made by Japanese representative Matsuoka in the morning. He briefly stated that Japan's traditional policy of aggression is the real threat to peace. China's economic boycott is only an act of self-defense, and each economic boycott is caused by Japan's aggression. China cannot be held responsible for this, and this is not an irrational action. China has never been anti-foreign. Countless foreigners now live in China in peace, and even Japanese are now receiving the same protection. The Chinese people's current animosity towards Japan is entirely due to Japan's aggression. China demands the restoration of the rights that have been stolen and lost. China deeply knows that the path of negotiation can make natural policies come true. It hopes that the League of Nations will give China justice. (Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 21st: Regarding the Executive Yuan's discussion of the Manchurian dispute that began this morning, after the representatives of China and Japan have each stated their views, the Lytton Commission, which is now in Geneva, may be consulted by the Executive Yuan on the differences raised by the two parties regarding the report. Therefore, the Lytton Commission will meet at the same time as the Executive Yuan in the next few days. It is generally expected that the Executive Yuan will only discuss the Manchurian issue within this week, and the results of the discussion will not be immediately concluded. However, it is even more likely that the file on the Manchurian issue, along with the documents recently submitted by China and Japan, will be transferred to the League of Nations General Assembly or to the Committee of Nineteen chaired by Belgian representative Hymans. The Committee of Nineteen will not meet before the beginning of December, as Hymans will be residing in the Belgian capital due to the Belgian general election on November 29.</p>
<p>Nationalist News Agency, Geneva, 20th: According to an official of the League of Nations Secretariat, Japan expressed opposition to the various proposals for resolving the Manchurian issue put forward in its opinion on the Lytton Report. Japan's opinion is 50 pages long and strongly criticizes the commission's method of investigation, saying that the commission made judgments on the most important points of the dispute based on extremely questionable evidence. The Lytton Report does not advocate maintaining the current Manchukuo puppet state, so Japan's opinion once again strives to state that the establishment of the puppet state not only does not conflict with the various international conditions that Japan has already concluded but also is very consistent with the wishes of the local people of Manchuria and is the only satisfactory basis for establishing an understanding with China. Furthermore, Japan's opinion dismisses the international co-management and the establishment of international police forces advocated in the Lytton Report, saying that these measures would be extremely difficult to maintain the security of Manchuria.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from the delegation in Geneva stating that the Lytton Report will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion on the 23rd. The 21st and 22nd will be for negotiating procedures. The Japanese side advocated that the China-Japan issue should be discussed directly by the Executive Yuan and opposed submitting it to the Committee of Nineteen and the Special Assembly. This is because only major countries participate in the Executive Yuan, and activities are more convenient. More than 50 countries participate in the General Assembly, and small countries have always criticized Japan's policy of aggression, which is unfavorable to Japan. However, on February 12 of this year, our country has requested the General Assembly to discuss it in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant, and it has been accepted by the General Assembly. Therefore, the right to discuss the China-Japan dispute has long been in the hands of the General Assembly. Although the Lytton Commission was dispatched by the Executive Yuan, it has to be discussed by the Executive Yuan first. The right to final discussion and resolution still belongs to the General Assembly. Although Japan is active, it is difficult for other countries to agree, and the result is a failure without any doubt. (Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: According to information sent by the Japanese delegation in Geneva to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning, Representative Matsuoka has summed up the impressions gained from private consultations with representatives of various countries since his arrival in Europe. The League of Nations holds the following views: The China-Japan issue has been subject to Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant since September of last year. Later, because the Chinese side submitted a letter calling for a General Assembly to be convened on February 12 of this year, the Council on February 19 decided to transfer the letter to the General Assembly and apply Article 15 of the Covenant. However, the review of the report should be done by the Council, and the final resolution should be transferred to the General Assembly. The Japanese government immediately sent the following instructions to Representative Matsuoka in Geneva: (1) It recognizes that the initiator of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant is limited to the Shanghai Incident. It has always attached reservations regarding Manchukuo. (2) The commission was appointed based on the resolution of the Council, but the review of its report should be done by the Council. Based on this fundamental reason, it absolutely opposes the Council's failure to make a principled ruling and simply transferring the issue to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 20th: Since Japan submitted its memorandum in response to the Lytton Report, general observations have recognized that a crisis is imminent. The wording of the Japanese memorandum is quite precise, but the points that explain Japan's position are strongly worded, enough to indicate that Japan will not accept the points suggested by the Lytton Commission. It is now generally believed that the mediation procedure by the Executive Yuan under Article 10 is hopeless. Now that the League of Nations Special Assembly has authorized the Committee of Nineteen to discuss the China-Japan issue, the Executive Yuan is in a special position. The Executive Yuan's responsibility is to seek mediation in the China-Japan dispute. Now, according to Yan Huiqing's declaration and Japan's memorandum, mediation is hopeless. The General Assembly now has no other way but to send the report to the Committee of Nineteen.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 20th: It is generally believed here that the China-Japan dispute is likely to cause a major crisis. The League of Nations General Assembly will begin debating the China-Japan issue at 1:00 AM on November 20. At that time, Japanese representative Matsuoka will report Japan's position, and the Chinese side will reply by Gu Weijun. The observations of both sides will be criticized by the Lytton Commission. It is still difficult to predict where this matter will go, but the general public holds wishful thinking, because Japan has already indicated that it rejects the Lytton Report, and Chinese representative Yan Huiqing also took a tough stance in his speech, indicating that China will invoke Article 16 of the Covenant to punish the aggressor. Since both sides have gone to extremes, it is hopeless for the Executive Yuan to try to mediate under Article 11 of the Covenant. The General Assembly now has no other way but to send the report to the Committee of Nineteen.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 20th: With the date of the League of Nations Executive Yuan's discussion of the Manchurian issue approaching, China and Japan have each sent a large number of personnel to form delegations to go to Geneva. The Chinese delegation has a total of 50 people, while the Japanese delegation has as many as 70 people. Japanese Special Envoy Matsuoka Yosuke submitted Japan's opinion on the Lytton Report to League of Nations Secretary-General Sir Drummond yesterday. Matsuoka has visited US Representative Davis and League of Nations Executive Yuan Chairman de Valera and will continue to visit the Chinese delegation today, which is also active.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 21st: Japanese Plenipotentiary Matsuoka gave a speech at the League of Nations Radio Broadcasting Station in Geneva yesterday, which was clearly heard here and transmitted to all parts of the country. Matsuoka earnestly stated in his speech that the great powers' recognition of "Manchukuo" is the only way to restore peace in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Lord Lytton's Broadcast Informs the World</h3>
<p>Saying that the Situation in the Far East Is Not Hopeless</p>
<p>Sarcastically Suggesting That Japan Not Act Recklessly to the End</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 20th: Lord Lytton gave a speech broadcast from the League of Nations broadcasting station today to inform the world, saying that although the situation in the Far East is worrying, it is not hopeless. Today is a time when the world should be very worried, but he hopes that the waves that started in Manchuria can be recovered by wise political skills.</p>
<p>The Current Situation in the East Violates the Treaty and the Dispute Is Not Just Over the Power</p>
<p>The current situation in Manchuria should not be regarded as in accordance with the existing treaties. The point of contention is more important than the question of whether those who manage Manchuria should be China or Japan, that is, whether the principle of the common responsibility for maintaining peace between countries should be preserved or sacrificed.</p>
<p>Japan Recognizes That the Puppet Country Is Absolutely Unreasonable; War Is of No Benefit</p>
<p>Lytton mentioned Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo," saying that if an action is absolutely unreasonable in itself, it cannot be considered reasonable simply because it has become a fact. The solution proposed in the commission's report will ultimately benefit Japan, because if Japan wants to maintain the status quo in the face of China's animosity and civil indignation, the price will be extremely high. It would also benefit China if the three northeastern provinces no longer have the danger of recurring conflicts.</p>
<p>The Commission's False Courtesy Should Not Be Seen as an Expression of Recognition</p>
<p>Lord Lytton mentioned the commission's tour of the three northeastern provinces, saying that the commission cannot recognize those who claim to be the government of an independent country. The commission can only show ceremonial respect, such as wearing formal attire and hats when visiting guests and drinking champagne together, but the commission clearly stated that it cannot recognize the existence of their country or their position. Lord Lytton urged the world to be patient and trust, saying that people may be impatient because the League of Nations is proceeding through discussion and meetings. It should be known that this method is necessary for mediation.</p>

<h3>External Statement Against Japan's Written Opinion Begins Point-by-Point Refutation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Affairs Committee convened a meeting at 5 PM on the 21st.</p>
<p>All committee members in Nanjing attended. It is reported that there were two main items discussed: ㈠ Studying the telegram reports and requests for instructions from the delegation, and deciding on principles to be telegraphed to the delegation as a basis for action. ㈡ Studying the content of Japan's opinions on the Lytton Report in order to refute them. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain authority in diplomatic circles discussed the League of Nations Council</p>
<p>The formal meeting to discuss the report is scheduled for the 23rd. All members of the investigation team will be present, except for the American member, General McCoy. However, the Japanese side firmly insists that the report should only be discussed by the Council. Their reasons are: ㈠ They believe that the investigation team was dispatched by the Council, and the Council's adoption of the report should be decided by the Council meeting. ㈡ Japan has consistently opposed submitting the Sino-Japanese incident to the League of Nations General Assembly for adjudication. Therefore, they believe that the final solution of the League of Nations to the report should not be submitted to the General Assembly for deliberation. Their intention is that since the Council only has representatives from fourteen member states, it is easier for Japan to exert diplomatic influence. If submitted to the General Assembly, small countries account for the majority of the fifty-four countries, and the representatives of small countries are emotionally charged and sympathize with the weaker party, making it more difficult for Japan to maneuver. The League of Nations believes that the Sino-Japanese incident has been fully entrusted to the General Assembly, and its final resolution should be decided by the General Assembly. A compromise solution is currently being considered. In fact, the League of Nations will never change its established policy due to the dissenting attitude of Japan alone. Our side believes that this is absolutely nothing to worry about. (21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain diplomatic authority said that the League of Nations Council meeting</p>
<p>Convened at 11 AM on the 21st, it was decided to begin discussing the Lytton Report on the Sino-Japanese issue on Wednesday. The duration of the meeting depends on whether the initial discussion of the report goes smoothly. The Japanese side only wants the report to be discussed by the Council and does not want the Council to submit it to the General Assembly. The reasons and intentions are already clear to those who know. Our side urges the League of Nations to attach importance to the responsibilities and authority of the League itself based on the Covenant and the Charter, and to conduct a fair discussion. Japan's written opinion was officially published on the 21st. Although the full text has not yet been seen, the content of the five chapters is very critical of our country. Our side will have a textual refutation. This time, the League of Nations focuses on legal facts and does not care about the verbal or textual disputes between the two parties. Diplomacy that does not seek external help lies in the presentation of facts. The victory of Su Bingwen's volunteer army has a greater impact and relationship than thousands of declarations or protests by our representatives and our authorities. The urgent situation in northern Manchuria is being paid attention to by the international community. Therefore, facts are the most eloquent, and cannot be confused by other parties' texts. Therefore, the government's instructions to the delegation only provide guidance on how to deal with the situation. Our side has no special proposals for the Council meeting. When the report is officially discussed, the delegation will respond flexibly depending on the situation. The outside world is also paying attention to whether the United States will join the discussion of the Sino-Japanese issue. However, in order to maintain its influence and prestige in the Far East, the United States does not advocate intervening in the Sino-Japanese issue, and does not wait for the invitation of the League of Nations. The new President Roosevelt was elected, and the former president is preparing to hand over office. Issues such as war debts and disarmament that are closely related to his own interests are all waiting to be carried out. There will be a substantial statement on the Sino-Japanese issue after the new president takes office in March next year. He then said that our representative in Geneva has been reporting in detail on the general situation of the League of Nations in recent days. It is not convenient to publish it at this moment. Only a part of Japan's opinions on the Lytton Report has been seen, and the whole picture has not yet been seen. After studying it completely, we will consider adding a rebuttal. If Japan says that we have no organization and are not a country, then what was Yoshiwara doing when he presented his credentials in May? If it is said that the Manchurian people are self-determined, then try to remove the Japanese troops in the Northeast now, and see if Puyi can live peacefully in Changchun. We cannot be rash in boasting or humiliation, and dare to base our arguments on facts. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations Council meeting opened on the 21st. The session is expected to last about two weeks. Our delegation will be represented by Gu Weijun. It was not until the special meeting that Yan, Gu, and Guo attended, with Yan as the chief representative. The Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting at the diplomatic residence on the afternoon of the 21st and had some discussions. During the Council meeting, meetings will be held daily to study the progress of the meeting and instruct the delegation to follow up. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Zhang Leyi, and secretary Huang Chundao, flew to Nanjing from Shanghai by plane on the morning of the 21st. According to reports, the League of Nations has convened a meeting to discuss solutions to the Sino-Japanese issue. I am coming to Nanjing to assist the central government in dealing with diplomatic affairs. We do not need to speculate on the outcome of the General Assembly's discussions, but only strive for our own efforts and struggles, and then the final victory will belong to us. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese government officially released the summary of its opinions on the Lytton Report on the 21st. As for the summary transmitted by the Telegraphic Communication Agency up to the 18th, it was initially said to be released by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the next day it was telegraphed to cancel the words "released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs". Therefore, what was released by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 21st is slightly different from what was transmitted by the Telegraphic Communication Agency. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Our country only allocated 20,000 US dollars to Representative Yan for publicity expenses to the League of Nations. Japan has stipulated 5 million Japanese yen for publicity expenses to the League of Nations. The difference between the two numbers is huge. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japan's opinions on the Lytton Report were officially published on the 21st. The content is absurd and outrageous, and the wording is barbaric and unreasonable, creating a strange state that has never existed in international diplomatic documents. This has caused great revulsion in the League of Nations, and the United States has also refuted it. At the beginning of the League of Nations opening, although a certain important person in the government refuted it one day ago, it still needs to be strongly refuted. The article has been drafted and will be published on the 22nd. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese ambassador officially released his written opinion on the League of Nations report on the 21st. The Foreign Ministry has received a telegram from Jiang Zuobin and is drafting a refutation by the Asian Department. The method of disclosure is undecided. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Representative Yan's Statement</h3>
<p>We oppose militarism</p>
<p>Hope that the League of Nations can sanction atrocities</p>
<p>Justice and fairness are not upheld</p>
<p>Will be forced to use force against Japan</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 20th. The Chinese representative, Yan Huiqing, told foreign reporters this afternoon that China has no intention of overturning the conclusions of the Lytton Report. China does not fully agree with all the points of the report, but believes that the impartial committee is composed of well-known figures recognized by both parties. Its conclusions should not be refuted by either party, and the facts are very obvious. China does not now claim to have adopted policies that directly violate the proposals or advice of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry, or resist the League of Nations and its treaty obligations, nor does it declare militarism as a clean and honorable thing. China has been resisting Japanese militarism for more than a year. We are prepared to continue to resist, for a long time without slackening. If necessary, we will also use force to clear the enemy troops from our country. But we hate war and yearn for peace. We are here to ask the League of Nations to give us peace and justice. Unfortunately, the Japanese warlords do not want peace but want war. They do not regard the Geneva Conference as a tool for fair resolution, but as an opportunity to continue their undeclared military actions against China while seeking a negative international guarantee to reject foreign interference. We trust in maintaining credibility with the League of Nations, just as we trust that the member states of the League of Nations will also maintain credibility with China when the time comes. The Chinese representative may invoke other articles of the League of Nations Covenant. Dr. Yan quoted the text of the Lytton Report, describing the Chinese government's practical success in suppressing communism. He then spoke of the status of the three northeastern provinces, saying that the three northeastern provinces are not suitable for Japanese colonization, and that the so-called independence movement in the three northeastern provinces was unheard of before the Japanese invasion. Now the time</p>
<p>has come for China and the world to hope that the League of Nations will take swift and practical action</p>
<p>to seek a solution that China deserves under the League of Nations Covenant. He knows that the League of Nations will not allow Japan to carry out its delays in solving the problem in order to increase the severity of the situation at the military level, and ultimately demonstrate to the world the League of Nations' advocacy of justice and fairness, and its courage to make firm decisions and monitor their implementation.</p>

<p>Japan's Written Opinion Ultimately Cannot Justify Itself</p>
<h3>US Official Circles Avoid Formal Criticism but Express Willingness to Cooperate with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 20th. The United States authorities, fearing that formal comments on Japan's written opinion on the Lytton Report might be misconstrued as indirect interference with the League of Nations, only expressed informal opinions today, believing that the written opinion is difficult to justify. There are many aspects that differ greatly from the views of the United States. Even on other points, the reasons are very weak. Key American figures in responsible positions find it particularly difficult to agree with the Japanese position that the Nine-Power Treaty does not apply to the Manchurian dispute, and believe that this position is absolutely difficult to justify. The United States believes that the Nine-Power Treaty was specifically designed to protect China's unity. Now, as a result of Japanese military action, China's unity has been directly destroyed. The United States is willing to recognize that China is currently lacking a certain degree of unity and is lacking domestic stability. However, when the Nine-Power Treaty was concluded, Japan and other signatory countries had already clearly recognized this fact and, after fully understanding the situation in China, agreed to negotiate and agree not to interfere. The US authorities also said that when the Nine-Power Treaty was put forward for discussion, China was in the midst of various warlords confronting each other. The South did not cooperate with the Beijing government, and the three northeastern provinces also had their own political orders, and were the true rulers of a part of mainland China. Considering the reason for concluding this treaty at that time, this was one of the reasons. However, since Japan's written opinion is directed solely at the League of Nations, the US authorities believe that it has nothing to do with the United States and does not need to be formally commented on, and expressed that although the United States will not be active during the League of Nations' discussion, it can guarantee to the member states of the League of Nations that if the steps it believes should be taken, the United States will give it full sympathy and cooperation. An important official also said that the United States' attitude is a passive endorsement of the League of Nations' resolution of the dispute. As for those outside of official circles, they are not surprised by Japan's written opinion. Although newspapers publish it in a prominent position, general public opinion claims that what is said in it has long been heard by Japanese propagandists here.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New York, 21st. The New York Tribune today criticized the latest episode of the Sino-Japanese issue, saying that Japanese diplomats may not blame their warlords for their actions. Japanese warlords are trying to mislead the public into believing that Western countries led by the United States now want to isolate and destroy Japan. The newspaper also said that time is an important element in the resolution of the Manchurian issue. On November 7, President Hoover stated that the US government is unwilling to participate in any plan to implement the Kellogg-Briand Pact with military or economic pressure. The newspaper praised this statement, saying that President Hoover's disclosure of US policy will never be misunderstood by the Japanese people. The President's remarks strictly limit the determination of US treaty rights in China. The United States will not participate in any action that may cause the implementation of sanctions, leading to a state of war. This move is very important, etc.</p>
<h3>Japan Repeatedly Creates an Atmosphere of Direct Negotiations</h3>
<p>▲ China United News Agency, Tokyo, 21st. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today again used its official news agency, "Japan News United Agency," to spread an atmosphere of direct negotiations. Because the League of Nations atmosphere is deteriorating, if Japan insists on opposing the Lytton Report and the resolutions of the Council or the General Assembly, Japan will be regarded as an aggressive country, knowing only guns and not justice, and diplomacy will fall into a stalemate. Therefore, under the guise of direct negotiations, Japan refuses to open discussions. According to reports, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed to a certain major country to help, and its strategies are listed on the left:</p>
<p>㈠ If the General Assembly refuses to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute, all countries will be angry at Japan's violence and barbarism. The discussion will still be allowed to proceed, but no proposals will be agreed to, so that all countries cannot obtain any results, and it will be allowed to develop naturally. ㈡ If creating this atmosphere is successful, then take the opportunity to resolve to set a limit of six months and advise China and Japan to negotiate directly. ㈢ The "Manchukuo" must be recognized as an independent country to participate in the negotiations.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 21st. The 69th session of the League of Nations Council, which is deliberating the Sino-Japanese dispute, opened at 11 AM this morning in the League of Nations Secretariat. However, because the nature of this issue is quite important and complex, the heads of major countries who have always guided the resolution of the issue have not mentioned a solution to the issue. Therefore, many people believe that the League of Nations is unable to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue and can only stand by and watch. However, just before the Council meeting, a certain highest leader of the League of Nations suddenly issued a report on the League of Nations' policy on resolving this issue. The report was telegraphed by the Japanese delegation in Geneva to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 20th. The general meaning is as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ The League of Nations will discuss the entire Sino-Japanese dispute by the Council and the General Assembly. ㈡ The League of Nations will not take direct measures to resolve the dispute, but the General Assembly will resolve to advise China and Japan to begin direct negotiations within three or six months after the end of the General Assembly. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to study how to deal with this proposal with a cautious attitude. However, Japan is determined to consistently insist that the establishment of a strong central government in China, the existence of "Manchukuo," and Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" are absolutely necessary conditions.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Have Different Views</p>
<h3>Labor Party and Liberal Party Advocate Justice, Most Conservative Party Newspapers Favor Japan</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, London, 21st. Today, London newspapers have different views on Japan's written opinion on the Lytton Report. Most Conservative Party newspapers have pro-Japanese views. The most extreme is the Conservative Party's Daily Mail, which calls it a very well-argued document, proving that the Japanese have their own reasons. The Morning Post of the same party even said that if one reads the Japanese written opinion carefully with an impartial eye, it will be clear that Japan is on a stronger legal and moral footing, and most of those who criticize Japan would probably want to admit this statement, etc. From this, we can get a glimpse of the Conservative Party's attitude. The Liberal Party and Labor Party newspapers can all advocate justice and condemn the Japanese as aggressors. For example, the Liberal Party's Chronicle still calls Japan an aggressor, saying that its reply is to directly refuse to accept the Lytton Report, because regardless of the results of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry or any other investigations, Japan will refuse to accept them unless they are obtained by the Japanese themselves under the sword. The Labor Party's Daily Herald also has the same view, saying that we fear that it will be difficult to imagine a member state of the League of Nations that more effectively insults and resists the League of Nations than Japan.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 21st. Mr. Cummings, in the Exchange News, commented on today's meeting of the League of Nations to consider the Lytton Report, saying that this is the League of Nations' last chance. Withdrawing from the League of Nations is the last thing Japan wants to do. He expects the Japanese representatives to do their best to persuade the League of Nations to allow the "Manchukuo" to continue its experiment, and perhaps to say a kind of broad and free system to replace the Lytton Report. Whether the League of Nations will reject this temptation and insist on not letting it happen is unknown. The public trial, which will take a long time, begins today and will determine the most important question: In this new world, should the winner be the rule of law or force?</p>
<h3>Japanese Government's Policy Toward the League of Nations Obtains Saionji's Understanding</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 21st. Prime Minister Saito's visit to</p>
<p>Elder Saionji is greatly emphasized here. The Prime Minister has returned to Beijing this morning. It is reported that Saionji has understood the budget for the coming year and Japan's policy toward the League of Nations regarding the Manchurian case.</p>
<h3>Ariyoshi Talks About Sino-Japanese Friendship Again on His Way Back to His Post</h3>
<p>▲ Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 21st. Minister to China Ariyoshi Akitame and others left Tokyo Station at 9:30 PM on the 20th to return to their posts. Ariyoshi told reporters in the car that he had met with Foreign Minister Uchida and key figures from all sides in Tokyo to report on the recent situation in China and discuss future policies toward China. The League of Nations is holding a meeting to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue. At this time, China and Japan should deal with it calmly. The League of Nations meeting is just a stage in a theater. We don't need to worry about the skill of the performance on the stage. China and Japan should quickly restore their economies to their original state and start trading, then both countries will benefit. The situation between the two countries is gradually improving. After I return to my post, I will strive to realize this matter.</p>
<p>North of Baiquan, the Volunteer Army Fiercely Attacked the Japanese Army in an Attempt to Break Through the Japanese Army's Encirclement [The Japanese Army in Ningguta Was Driven Back]</p>
<h3>Forty-Two Japanese Aircraft Flew From Shenyang to the Heilongjiang Border</h3>
<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese reports, the Japanese army's offensive against the Volunteer Army is currently underway. The scope of the war has now expanded. The Volunteer Army is now concentrated in Baiquan, forming a semi-circular front line. The Japanese army is attacking Baiquan in five directions.

The Japanese army attacking from Shaheji is said to have reached a point three miles away from Baiquan. There are now 15,000 Volunteer Army soldiers concentrated there. It is reported that the Japanese army's actions are encountering the greatest difficulty, as the land is muddy and difficult to travel on. North of Baiquan, the Volunteer Army is fiercely attacking the Japanese army in an attempt to break through the Japanese army's encirclement. There is also fighting in the Ningguta area.

<h3>Japanese Actively Recruiting Civilian Corps and Transferring Korean Immigrants</h3>

Chinese and foreigners live together. Extensive telephone materials are being installed, and after the immigrants arrive, telephones will be installed in each village and police will be implemented, aiming to seize our police power.

<p>Issues of Reciprocal Commodities in the Vietnam Trade Agreement</p>
<h3>Both Sides Have Considerable Disputes Regarding the List of Goods</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign news, the French side has approved the issue of the China-France-Vietnam border trade agreement. Welton's two visits to Beijing to negotiate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were relatively smooth. Regarding the list of goods in Chapter 8, it was originally divided into two types: A and B. Type A has no objections from both sides, while Type B has considerable disputes. The reciprocal commodities proposed by our side, silk and tea with light taxes, have long been agreed to by the French side. The hopes expressed by the Chinese in Vietnam in their petition have in fact been taken care of by the Chinese and French diplomatic authorities. As for the low tax on coal and rice proposed by the French side in Type B, although it is not very difficult to resolve, the French envoy said that the coal to be imported is hard coal, not lump coal, and hopes for special treatment. However, the Ministry of Finance is currently preventing the dumping of Fushun coal from the Northeast. In Shanghai, there is a domestic coal association requesting an increase in the tax rate on foreign coal. From the Ministry of Finance's standpoint, it is not convenient to have exceptions for local border agreements, so they have not agreed yet. Welton believes that if there is a low tax on coal and rice, then the reciprocal low tax on silk and tea cannot be discussed further. As for the low tax on rice, our government can still agree, because the provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong have a large annual need for Vietnamese rice, while other provinces need less. In case our country has a disaster and poor harvest, we rely on Vietnamese rice for supply. As long as domestic rice is sufficient, there is no need to specialize in eating foreign rice. This layer has no major drawbacks. Currently, Japan and Vietnam have just signed a trade agreement, in which Japan only collects light taxes on silk and tea, and rice and coal are also reciprocal. However, Japan has no need for Vietnamese rice and coal, so it does not feel any loss. If the Vietnam border trade agreement is delayed in approval, and China is treated as a non-treaty country, the merchants of the three provinces will suffer great losses. (21st Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Hindenburg Allows Hitler to Attempt to Form a New Cabinet, But Only if He Can Obtain the Support of a Majority in Parliament</h3>
<p>Negotiations Between the National Socialist Party and the Centre Party Begin</p>
<p>▲National News Agency Berlin, 21st: National Socialist Party leader Hitler, accompanied by Frick and Göring, visited President Hindenburg at 10:30 this morning. They left after only fifteen minutes. It is reported that the outcome of the conversation was that the President gave him a six-hour deadline to find a majority of seats in Parliament to support the National Socialist Party cabinet as a basis for forming a cabinet. After the meeting, Mr. Hess reiterated his demand to form a cabinet, saying that the National Socialist Party refused to participate in a cabinet led by others. The President still refused his request and finally gave him the opportunity to try to form a cabinet, but Mr. Hess did not fully accept the President's conditions, replying that he would report to the party leaders in writing at 5:00 pm regarding the condition that the cabinet be able to obtain a majority of support in Parliament. Observers believe that the President's move is still not entrusting Mr. Hess to try to form a cabinet, but only ordering him to try to find out whether he can obtain a majority in Parliament. If Mr. Hess fails to do so, it is expected that someone from another party will be entrusted to try to form a new cabinet.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency Berlin, 20th: Negotiations between the National Socialist Party and the Catholic Centre Party have already begun today.

Mr. Hitler did not personally attend today's meeting, but was represented by his two strong lieutenants, Strasser and Göring.</p>

<h3>US Government Releases Documents Regarding Loans to Former Allies, Implies Opposition to War Debt Reduction</h3>
<p>▲ From the Guomin News Agency, Washington, 20th: The US State Department tonight released correspondence between the US and former Allied nations regarding monetary matters. One letter indicates that US loans saved the Allies from a severe financial panic. Another letter reveals that at one point, Britain's cash reserves were only sufficient to maintain exchange rates for one day when it received a loan. The purpose of the US government's release is unclear, but it is suspected to subtly suggest the government will maintain a firm stance against canceling or reducing war debts. Some interpret this as a prelude to proposing that creditor nations should also be considered at this time. While there is little talk in political circles today about extending the moratorium period, since the President seems to favor it, it is expected to become the current solution.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>US News Agency Describes the Sino-Japanese Problem: Its Past and Predictable Outcomes. Japan's International Robbery Will Be Judged by the World Today.</h3>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Agency states that the League of Nations is scheduled to discuss the investigation report tomorrow. At this time, it is appropriate to summarize the events of the past year. However, a description from the perspective of the parties involved may be biased. Fortunately, the US-based United Press International has published an article that takes a third-party stance, is concise, fair, and predicts four possible outcomes. The future path will inevitably be one of these. This agency has considerable influence in the United States. The original text is translated below:</p>
<p>Less than a year ago, the Japanese navy bombarded Shanghai with long-nosed cannons, machine-gun squads swept through the devastated Chinese streets, and pilots dropped bombs on the burning ruins to complete the picture of death and destruction. Since then, the world has been outraged. What has happened since the weak China dared to resist Japanese goods and was given a terrible practical lesson? In the past few months, this small but militarily ambitious island nation has completely plundered China's rich province of Manchuria and established a puppet "Manchukuo" there. Japan continues its policy of expansion through conquest, having militarily seized the richest region of China, the size of which is equal to the combined area of Germany and the Netherlands. Its railways account for half of all railways in China, and its agricultural and mineral wealth is immeasurable. For this crime of robbing its neighbor's ten most desirable regions, Japan stands accused of violating three major international treaties. Today, at the League of Nations meeting in Geneva, when the Chinese complaint is heard, Japan will be judged by the world. But to make this matter clear, we must look back to last September, when someone (including a mysterious group) destroyed a Japanese-owned railway north of Shenyang. Japan then invaded Manchuria "to restore law and order." The hundreds of millions of Chinese people, with all their best weapons, resisted a powerful military enemy and declared a boycott of Japanese goods. This move struck at the economic heart of industrial Japan, as Japan's market largely depended on China. This was followed in January by a terrible practical lesson in Shanghai. Japan claimed that Japanese lives and property were in danger. The Shanghai incident was merely a smokescreen because Japan's real goal was still Manchuria, as later events proved.</p>
<p>In February and March, although the United States and other countries made efforts to seek peace in Manchuria, Japan continued its campaign. China refused to discuss peace terms until the invading Japanese troops returned to their homeland. Japan also refused to do this.</p>
<p>In May, young army and navy officers in Japan engaged in political assassinations and bombings. The power of the military cliques increased. Prime Minister Inukai was assassinated, and the government fell, replaced by a new government. This new government was merely a tool of the military. Army Minister Araki became the power behind the new government and still holds power today.</p>
<p>In August, Foreign Minister Uchida announced the plan to recognize the new state of Manchuria, naming it Manchukuo. Chinese Foreign Minister Luo Wengan quickly responded, saying, "Japan has now taken off its mask and openly announced its plan to invade China." In September, Japan formally "recognized" its self-created puppet state, establishing a government that guarantees Japan's existing rights, with the deposed Chinese Emperor Puyi as its regent.</p>
<p>Japan organized this government, drafted its constitution, selected its officials, filled its positions in all departments, provided it with money, and defended it with a powerful military force. This is the situation today.</p>
<p>Thus, Japan has written another chapter in its history of military expansion. This is a continuation of its seizure of Kagoshima in 1875 by a small country with aggressive intentions, its seizure of Taiwan in the Sino-Japanese War of 1895, its seizure of Kwantung (Liaodong) and Sakhalin from the Russians in 1905, and its final annexation of Korea in 1910. When the League of Nations General Assembly meets today, it will have the report of a neutral investigation team with no vested interests for discussion. This investigation team was sent to Manchuria by the League of Nations this summer. The report of the Lytton Commission has been long awaited and has recently been published. It is unfavorable to Japan, completely refuses to recognize Japan's control over Manchuria, and strongly defends China's sovereignty in the region. The investigation team was chaired by Lord Lytton of Britain, with one commissioner each from the United States, France, Germany, and Italy. The American commissioner was General McCoy.</p>
<p>The United States government has also similarly refused to recognize the results of Japan's military aggression in Manchuria (Japan is apparently not very concerned). Japan now has Manchuria and, from all indications, intends to keep it.</p>
<p>Never before has a nation been accused of international robbery and judged by the world as Japan will be at the upcoming General Assembly. In summary, its trial will be for the crimes Japan is accused of.</p>
<p>Japan is accused of violating three major international treaties. These three treaties are binding on all major countries in the world. Japan has signed each of these treaties: 1) The Nine-Power Treaty, signed at the Washington Naval Conference in 1922, guarantees China's integrity; 2) The Kellogg-Briand Pact, in which the signatory nations renounce war as an instrument of national policy; 3) The League of Nations Covenant, which stipulates that territorial disputes should be resolved by mutual agreement without the use of force.</p>
<p>Japan's defense is: 1) Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty, Japan replies that the situation in China has become impossible, forcing neighboring Japan to take action to protect Japanese interests (the US argument is that Japan knew China's unfortunate situation when it signed the treaty, and the fact that the situation may have worsened cannot be used as an excuse for violation). 2) Regarding the Non-Aggression Pact, Japan replies that it has not violated it, and its actions in Manchuria were for self-defense and consistent with the reservations of major countries (it will now be decided whether Japan acted in self-defense). 3) Regarding the League of Nations Covenant, Japan replies that there was no seizure, and the people of Manchuria seceded from China and established an independent government (whether Japan is using this independent country as an excuse to seize Chinese territory is a question to be decided).</p>
<p>Possible outcomes: 1) The League of Nations can acquit Japan, disregard the Lytton Report, and condone Japan's protectorate of Manchuria. 2) The League of Nations can instruct member states to apply moral pressure to Japan to abandon Manchuria. 3) The League of Nations can instruct member states to impose a diplomatic, economic, and financial boycott on Japan until Japan abides by the treaty. 4) Japan can ask the League of Nations to suspend the matter, withdraw its membership, and continue to do whatever it wants with China.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments on the Sichuan War Fronts</h3>
<p>▲ The Important Front Line is Still in Luzhou</p>
<p>Chongqing Communication: Recent developments on the Sichuan war fronts: 1) On the inside, the Chongqing troops have been shelling the city from across the river in recent days. The provincial troops no longer occupy the city but are mostly hidden in the reed beds along the riverbank outside the city. The Chongqing troops have built hundreds of bamboo rafts to prepare for a forced crossing. 2) In the Fushun area, most of the Chongqing troops have advanced to the eastern street on the south bank, but the provincial troops have not retreated. Recently, they suddenly launched an attack on the right flank of the Chongqing troops from the area of Pipa Chang, Zhao Dai Zhen, and Tongjia Temple, and attacked the left flank of the Chongqing troops in the area of Shizi Tan and Jinyin Mountain. The fighting was fierce. 3) In the Luxian area, the provincial troops have completely emerged from hiding outside the city. Chen Lantting's division of the Chongqing troops formed three daredevil groups, carrying new weapons to launch a forced crossing and assault. The first group has already crossed the river but suffered a disastrous defeat. Liu Xiang was furious and ordered the air force to drop heavy bombs, regardless of the destruction of the city of Luzhou. It is also reported that one of Liu Xiang's warships was sunk. 4) In the Jian Lezi area, Jianyang, Lezhi, Ziyang, Shuangliu, and Chongqing counties were originally garrisoned by the provincial troops but have now been handed over to the 28th Army (Deng Xihou) to take over the defense, to prevent conflict with the 29th Army (Tian Songyao). Deng has ordered the entire second mixed brigade of his troops, led by Chen Jingshan, to be stationed in Lezhi, the entire second mixed brigade led by Yang Xiuchun to be stationed in Ziyang, and the entire third mixed brigade led by Zhou Shaozhi to be stationed in Jianyang. The second division of Huang Yimin's troops will take over the defense of Shuangliu and Chongqing counties nearby. 5) On the Beidao Allied Army front, the various units of Li, Luo, and Yang have been at a standstill after occupying Shunqing, Suining, Tongnan, and Anyue counties.

<h3>Guangdong Province Prepares to Develop Hainan Island</h3>
<p>▲ Establishes Hainan Industry Bureau to Manage Everything</p>
<p>▲ The Industry Bureau is Subordinate to the Provincial Construction Department</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Hainan Island in Guangdong is an island rich in forests, mines, and marine products. Its natural resources have been accumulating for a long time. Recently, the local government has taken the first step to eliminate bandits and communists and then engage in development. It is reported that the communists in Mount Mu Rui have been largely eliminated after a major siege by the Guard Brigade, and only a few hundred of Wang Wenning's pseudo-Red Army remain, fleeing to Lehui. If the remaining bandits are captured, the communist disaster in Hainan may be slightly alleviated. The authorities, believing that the pacification work is about to be completed, will implement the development of Hainan as the second step in governance. The Guangdong Provincial Construction Department recently decided to establish a Hainan Industry Bureau on the spot to be the governing agency, planning everything. The Hainan Industry Bureau will be subordinate to the Construction Department to facilitate the work. The outline of the bureau's organization has been drafted and will be established once it is approved by the Provincial Affairs Conference. The organizational content of the bureau is as follows: The Hainan Industry Bureau will handle matters related to: 1) industrial administration; 2) the development of fisheries, salt, and mineral products; 3) the improvement and promotion of agriculture, industry, commerce, and matters related to them; 4) the investigation, design, operation, and management of all industries; 5) assisting the people in developing and improving industries. The Industry Bureau may first operate the following businesses: 1) increasing grain production and improving seeds; 2) increasing livestock production and improving quality; 3) improving fishing and manufacturing; 4) trial planting and improvement of cotton and hemp; 5) mining and improvement of local specialties (such as rubber, coconut, betel nut, pineapple, coffee, etc.); 6) manufacturing various agricultural and industrial products; 7) manufacturing refined salt. The bureau will have one director who is responsible for everything. The director will have two departments and will hire technical experts and assistants to take charge of various technical matters. When necessary, experienced local industry experts may be hired as design commissioners.

<p>▲ Various Districts Request the Return of Cao's Regiment The Provincial Government approved the request. Cao Pang, the regimental commander of the 2nd Security Regiment of the Provincial Security, has been stationed in Songjiang for two years to protect the local area and has been very effective. His relationship with the local people is also very harmonious. Previously, due to the rampant banditry in Jiangbei, the Provincial Security Office ordered the regiment to move, leaving the students' company and battalion bottom in Songjiang. Now, various institutions in the county, such as the Chamber of Commerce, etc., have previously telegraphed the province to request the regiment's return to Songjiang. Subsequently, sixteen district chiefs, including Zhong Taishi, etc., telegraphed the provincial government, stating that winter defense is important in the county and requested the swift return of Cao's regiment to maintain local security. Yesterday, a reply was received from Provincial Governor Gu, stating that since the county's Chamber of Commerce, etc., had requested the return of the Second Regiment, it was deemed inappropriate to immediately调回 due to the urgency of suppressing bandits. Winter defense is important in the county, and the Department of Civil Affairs has been instructed to instruct the counties in the Joint Defense Zone to properly maintain defense. The request cannot be approved for the time being. You are hereby notified.</p>

The family was having dinner when a group of armed thugs suddenly rushed in. It is said that the head of the household was a woman and was very flustered for a moment and did not know what to do. The corner of the head of the household's eye was injured, and she was horrified and alerted the neighbors, who reported to the police station. The thugs, knowing that they could not stay, seized the opportunity to flee. The Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched armed police to pursue them without success. They also telegraphed the four sub-bureaus of the city to notify the police on duty to pay attention and派警崗 to guard the key points. The sudden occurrence of this case in the city has caused a great uproar. At the time of writing, all the police officers are still investigating.</p>

At that time, the accountant, Wu Yashan, repeatedly shouted "Robbers!" and the owner's wife, Yang Zhou Shi, happened to be at the door, so she forcefully held the thief back.

The junior high school performed Blood and Tears of Changchun, which was set against the background of the Northeast Incident. The lead actress, Ms. Duan, spoke Mandarin very fluently, and her performance was passionate and inspiring, which could inspire people's conscience and was especially commendable. It is also possible to see the difficulty of the school principal's painstaking efforts, considering that this is a private school with no funds or subsidies, and yet the achievements are so outstanding. It is heard that the school will also have to work hard to expand next year, adding a kindergarten class and piloting the first grade of high school. The future achievements are immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Guanghua Experimental Middle School Purchases New School Site</h3>
<p>Since its opening, Guanghua Experimental Middle School in Xieqiao has been very strict in its teaching and management. However, the original school building was insufficient, so the Shanghai County Government was asked to purchase school land near the new county office in Beiqiao on its behalf. Yan County has sent Sun Shiben, the district chief of the second district, to handle the matter. More than 50 acres have now been purchased, and construction is planned to begin next spring.</p>
<h3>New Atmosphere at Minsheng Primary School</h3>
<p>Minsheng Primary School (i.e., Minsheng Girls' School) on Beile Road in the French Concession of this city has been in operation for twenty-one years, and more than a thousand students have graduated. Since Xia Gengyi changed the director, the teaching and management have become more serious and have been registered by the Municipal Education Bureau. The school has a committee organization for extracurricular guidance for students, and has held composition competitions and storytelling competitions, which students are very interested in. The senior department of the school held a party the other day.</p>

<h3>Davis Cup Faces Sculpting Difficulties</h3>
<p>The cup is full of Chinese characters and cannot be carved again. The Grassland Association has three plans.</p>
<p>丨Or ask Davis to send another one丨</p>
<p>Paris, 19th - The history of the Davis Cup has reached a great difficulty. Because the Paris sculptor found that there was no place to carve the name of this year's winning country and the names of the players on the cup. The cup and tray are full of names.</p>
<p>▲ International Grassland Association plans Officials of the International Grassland Tennis Association admit that they are considering this difficulty. There are three plans: (1) Ask the owner of the cup, former US Army Chief and Governor of the Philippines Davis, to give another new silver cup. The price of silver has been low recently, which may be cheaper. (2) Engrave the names of future countries and players inside the silver cup, but this can only be maintained for ten years temporarily. (3) Add another tray under the silver cup.</p>
<p>▲ The grandeur of the Davis Cup Every year, the names of the two countries and team members that rule the competition, the results of the competition period and location, and the names of the countries eliminated in the preliminary rounds are engraved on the silver cup and the side of the tray. Next to it is engraved the history of tennis, the origin of the Davis Cup in 1900. This cup is actually a large silver basin, and an eighteen-month-old baby can bathe in it. Twenty-five quarts of champagne are needed to fill the cup. Because the French team pours bottle after bottle of wine into it every year after winning, it is used as a temporary wine storage device. Its size can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Jiang Defeated Jinan in the West Youth Basketball Game Last Night</h3>
<p>▲ Fifty-Three to Thirty-One</p>
<p>▲ The Victory Was Entirely in the Second Half</p>
<p>Pirates Beat US Navy by a Landslide</p>
<p>Two Class A Games Tonight</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jiang basketball team played against the Jinan team in the West Youth Basketball Game last night. They had a hard time scoring in the first half, but they didn't show their power until the second half. As a result, they won with a score of 53 to 31. There was also a Class A game, in which the West Youth Pirates defeated the US Navy Los Questeros by a score of 70 to 10, creating an amazing record. Three games tonight</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Jiang Won a Hard-Fought Victory over Jinan</p>
<p>▲ Jinan's lead all the way was unexpected. With Shanghai Jiang's prestige, it was trapped under Jinan in the first half, with no way out. Jinan's Xu Rongshui scored one point with a free throw, and Huang Zhaolin scored a goal, making it three to zero, then nine to two. Shanghai Jiang relied on Feng Nianhua's shot to try its best to catch up, but was always five or six points behind. It wasn't until after thirteen to seven that Shanghai Jiang caught up to a tie and then made it fifteen to fifteen. In the first half, Shanghai Jiang narrowly won by two points with a score of 19 to 17 in a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>▲ Huang Zhaolin's Amazing Long Shot The reason why the first half was so close was largely due to Huang Zhaolin's amazing long shot. He repeatedly scored in the half, and the entire Jinan team was unfamiliar with the connection and moved too slowly to break forward. The defense was still good, so it all relied on Huang's strength. Huang scored thirteen of the seventeen points in the first half, and the rest could not shoot the basket, so although there were many opportunities, they failed in the second half to Shanghai Jiang. In the second half, Huang retreated to defend, so the frontline power was even weaker.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Jiang's Front Court Greatly Diminished Shanghai Jiang's performance was greatly diminished in the first half. They first tried close passes, but were trapped in Jinan's siege defense and could not use their skills. They repeatedly failed to shoot the basket and relied entirely on Feng Nianhua's scoring. It wasn't until after that that they gradually became proficient. In the second half, Jinan tried to defend strictly, but it was not as good as before. Shanghai Jiang's shooting gradually returned to its original state, so after 23 to 21, they scored twelve consecutive points. Jinan could not maintain it and failed with a score of 53 to 31.</p>

<p>▲ Pirates Run Rampant and Defeat the Navy</p>
<p>The Pirates played for the first time last night and faced the US Navy Los Questeros with their most elite lineup. Their exquisite connection and the certainty of their shots were like a machine, which made people speechless. The Navy was helpless and let them run rampant, as if they were in no man's land. They only scored two points in the first half, and the Pirates scored 45 points in the second half. The Navy then scored eight points one after another and finished the game with a score of 70 to 10. The hope of winning the championship is probably still high for the Pirates.</p>

<h3>China Women's Basketball, Southeast Defeats East Asia</h3>
<p>▲ Result: 42 to 17</p>
<p>丨Chongde Defeats Shangzhong (B) 45 to 15丨</p>
<p>丨Southeast Defeats Nanyang (B) 32 to 13丨</p>
<p>▲ Two Group Matches Tonight</p>
<p>In the China Women's Basketball Association, in last night's Group A game between Southeast and East Asia, East Asia was extremely strong at the start, once leading 5 to 2. Southeast worked hard to attack, turning defeat into victory. The first quarter was 10 to 6. From then on, Southeast had a smooth ride and was unstoppable. The first half was 22 to 9. The result was 42 to 17. Ms. Pan Yueying scored 29 points alone for the winning team. However, the overall performance of the Southeast team was not fast enough. The passing and shooting felt slow, and the method was still too rigid. Players often gathered in one place and did not run to open spaces. This is a major problem. If they encounter a strong enemy, the chances of success are slim. They must be careful to guard against it. In the B Group match, Southeast B defeated Nanyang with 32 to 13, and Chongde defeated Shangzhong with 45 to 15. The results of each group are as follows:</p>

<h3>New Basketball Techniques (3) (3) (Not to be reprinted) Original by Claire Burcky, Translated by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yidong</h3>
<p>The University of Missouri basketball team in the United States used this tactic to counter zone defense in the Six University Tournaments, which was quite effective and occasionally enabled the Missouri team to record several pages of high scores in its annual history. No. 2 must pass the ball from the center of the opponent's left side through the free throw line to No. 5. If the defender of No. 5 fails to block No. 5, then No. 5 can shoot on the spot. Otherwise, it can be passed to No. 4, who is rushing along the right side of the opponent's defense zone. If No. 1 has attracted the opponent's left guard at this time and failed to block No. 4, then No. 4 can rush to the basket and put the ball in.</p>

<p>Aphorisms of Ma Xiangbo, a 93-Year-Old Man</p>
<h3>Growing Up Amidst National Woes</h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>Someone congratulated Old Man Xiang on his birthday. Old Man Xiang repeatedly denied it, saying:</p>
<p>"High age is not a true blessing, but rather more suffering. I grew up amidst national woes, and now that I am old, what is there to be happy about? One could also say that good people die early, so as to avoid suffering in this world!</p>
<p>I felt pain in my childhood because of national woes. I remember reading a French history textbook, which contained a comment on our country, mocking us as a people who breathe the air between heaven and earth without contributing anything! My good teacher often reminded me to work hard for the country.</p>
<p>Later, when I turned eighteen, the French consulate wanted to hire me as a secretary. I declined, saying, "I learned French for China's use!" They were very surprised and had to give up!</p>
<p>When China and France signed a treaty, the Chinese side was determined to have the phrase "maintain China's prestige." The French side refused, and it almost became a stalemate. At that time, Li Zhongtang (Hongzhang) asked me to find a way to make the other party agree! When I attended the meeting, I personally asked the French translator why he opposed using "prestige." He firmly stated that "prestige" meant "hope and expectation," which was inappropriate because it gave the Chinese side too much face. So I took out a Song Dynasty edition of the "Records of the Grand Historian" and, in Sima Qian's letter to Ren An, pointed out that "prestige" also meant "resentment." As a result, the French translator admitted, "Maintaining China's prestige" is considered passed! He also begged me not to tell the French representative to preserve his face as a translator who "doesn't understand Chinese"! I naturally smiled and agreed. Thinking of the past, and then today!! Alas!</p>
<p>The figures of the Japanese Restoration, such as Count Okuma, started later than me. When I was in Japan, he asked me to give lectures and so on. Now I am still being bullied by his descendants, living in a motherland facing national disaster! Alas! What is there to talk about being "ninety-five blessings, the first being longevity"!</p>
<h3>The Dense Frost of Military Policies</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>! The chrysanthemum is still fighting!</p>
<p>The weather gets colder every day. Dewdrops, like pearls, have turned into dense frost like steel knives. It thickly covers the fields. Flowers are groaning, grasses are crying in pain, and the birds on the branches are also shrinking their necks, speaking up for the weak. The cold wind, the fine rain, the cold weather have already ravaged their lives. Adding the harsh frost, how can they struggle? How can they endure it?</p>
<p>Flowers, wither! Grasses, turn yellow! Blame yourselves for being too weak, blame yourselves for being too fragile. You have no spirit of resistance, you have no determination to fight. How can you withstand the oppression, invasion, and humiliation of the harsh frost? You can only become victims under violence!</p>
<p>Several chrysanthemums by the fence are also heavily oppressed by the harsh frost. They also cry in pain, they also shed tears, but they are unwilling to succumb, they are unwilling to wither unconditionally. They rise up to fight, they rise up to resist. They invigorate the spirit of perseverance, release the courage of renewed efforts: enduring pain, enduring hardship, enduring all kinds of hardships, they retain a spirit of righteousness and valor. The bright sun shines like justice, and the harsh frost disappears like military force. The fighting chrysanthemums, under the blue sky and white sun, are still brilliant, still flourishing.</p>
<p>People of the whole country! The oppression of violence has given us many lessons in the past. Should we be weaklings who are shattered with one blow, or should we be resilient and fighting chrysanthemums? Please choose.</p>
<p>During the hasty flight to avoid the war, my whole family was scattered. The household was empty. For two months, not a single person was present. Only after two months was it possible to return to the old residence. All the items were safe and sound. One turtle, one fish, and one cat still survived. However, the three white swallows in the cage starved to death. It is unknown how the turtle, fish, and cat managed to find food. I recorded it all in poems.</p>
<p>Pan Lanshi</p>
<p>Those swallows, sang in harmony and elegance. Originally not for carved beams, yet they searched and found one another. Shared the fate of a Kalavinka bird, in the Western Paradise. I wish you would return to the mountains. Startling the peaks, a beautiful view.</p>
<p>You are smarter than humans, but not in your own well-being. I admire Yu Chuan, making my neighbor the water. The pot was overturned, the tiles were broken. Fortunately, escaped the disaster of fire. Nourishing its energy, carefully hidden. Relied on the turtle to guide me. (A bomb fell into the courtyard, the turtle's pot was upset, and so it escaped.)</p>
<p>Fish and I forget each other. Zhuangzi understood Zen. No disaster outside this world. There is heaven in the water. Vast is this river and lake. Clear and cold, I can entrust myself to it. In the algae, relying on the shore. I will work with the fish.</p>
<p>Alas, my dear cat, had no fish for two months. Not only no fish, but also no scraps. Longing for the cold felt, not leaving the courtyard. Rats ran rampant, taking over my land.</p>
<h3>Can't Chinese People Invent?</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Airplane::Film::Submarine</p>
<p>Everyone knows that China is an ancient country with more than 5,000 years of history, older than Babylon, Egypt, Rome, and India. Of course, the culture of the old brother is unmatched by anyone. Perhaps some people will say: the Chinese were able to invent the compass, but unable to sail far overseas and open up colonies, only using it as a tool for feng shui masters to survey land; invented gunpowder, but unable to manufacture guns, only using it as a toy for children to set off fireworks during the New Year: the Chinese may be able to invent, but what use is it! I say; not only that, but airplanes, movies, and submarines were also invented in our country long ago, but they only amounted to a myth and never became a reality! Now, please list them below:</p>
<p>(1) Airplane. Airplanes initially started with balloons, including hot air balloons! Very similar to the bright lanterns that children in our country release! There are two types of light gas balloons; they were invented by the Montgolfier brothers in France in the 17th century. As for our country, Qigongshi built a flying car that traveled far with the wind. Later, it was blown to Yuzhou, and Tang broke its car. After ten years, a strong east wind blew, and Tang restored its car and sent it away. Isn't this very similar to a balloon? Han Feizi said: "A foolish son made a wooden kite, it took three years to complete, and it failed in one day." The Hongshu says: Gongshuban made a wooden kite to spy on Song City. Wasn't the airplane invented by the Chinese?</p>
<p>(2) Film. This was invented based on optical principles. Sound films were only recently invented by the American Edison. However, Ban Gu's Han Shu says: (When Emperor Wu's wife, Lady Li, died, the Emperor missed her. A shaman from Qi named Shao Weng said he could summon her spirit, so he set up lanterns and candles at night. He set up a screen and presented wine and meat, and made the Emperor reside in another tent. From afar, he saw a beautiful woman resembling Lady Li in appearance; she returned to the tent, sat and walked; and he could not see her closely. The Emperor missed her with sorrow and composed a poem: "Is it her? Or not? Standing and looking at her, why is she so slow in coming!" He ordered the musicians of the Music Bureau to string and sing it.) From this passage, it is clearly a movie! In fact, the production of the zoetrope is the beginning of shadow play.</p>
<p>(3) Submarine. During the European War, German submarines were rampant at sea and were very powerful. Who knew that the submarine had already been invented two thousand years ago. Fu An's Fang Shi Wang Jia's "Lost Records" says: "Emperor Qin Shi Huang was fond of matters of gods and immortals. People from Wanqu came by snail boat; the shape of the boat was like a snail, it sank and traveled on the seabed, and water did not invade it, it was also called Lunbo Boat." Isn't this today's submarine?</p>
<h3>Hitting the Autumn Wind</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>! Is also one of the malpractices of a deformed society!</p>
<p>The original meaning of "hitting the autumn wind" is not very clear, but according to my humble opinion, it probably means that when the season comes to "autumn," and winter is approaching, the west "wind" pierces the bones. At that time, poor people had to "hit" the rich in order to solve the problem of hunger and cold, so servants presented meager gifts to flatter their masters, and received rewards from their masters that exceeded the price of the goods. Furthermore, they could take this opportunity to win the master's favor, and perhaps they would be understanding and forgiving in case of trouble. By extension, you could also hit the autumn wind at the homes of the master's relatives and friends if you knew them. However, there was a time limit for hitting the autumn wind, limited to festivals, or celebrations and funerals, etc. However, this kind of behavior used to be for servants to masters, but now it is not the same. As long as you have met and talked to a few friends, when something happens at their home, they will send you an invitation, or even invite you to help. As a result, you are embarrassed, so you have to send a gift. Even more absurd people, under false pretenses, send out invitations widely. In reality, there is no such thing, but to collect a large sum of money for their squandering! Isn't this a disguised form of hitting the autumn wind? Ah! When will this malpractice of a deformed society be eliminated?</p>

<h3>Crossroads of Death (2) (20) (1)</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>"Of course, the monster is a seer! Knowing that you weren't just inviting him to dinner, so he declined. Is there such a cheap, easy thing in the world?"</p>
<p>"By the conscience of heaven and earth!" Mu Liang swore, "I have no other ambitions at all, but just wanted to take this opportunity to talk to him and explore his tone to see if there were any gaps to take advantage of... But no matter what, I won't be discouraged, "Grind a thick coin into a needle..."</p>
<p>"What great ambition!" Han Dashao sneered coldly, provoking him. She was about to continue speaking, but a series of yawns came one after another. The little alarm clock rang, "... Han Dashao said,</p>
<p>"It's twelve o'clock, it's time for my sleepy eyes to go to sleep."</p>
<p>"Crash!:::Thump!:::! ::: The door opened, the hanging lamp in the side room went out, and the table lamp in front of the bed came on."</p>
<p>6. Go to war!</p>
<p>Liu A'gen, who sold his wife for two hundred dollars, and Jiang Niupi, who had just returned to Zou from Jiangxi, were talking intimately in the small teahouse in Cuiwei Village. They spoke very softly, so they were drowned out by the loud discussions of San A'die, the drunkard A'jin, and Mr. Feng, and not a single sentence attracted the attention of others. Otherwise, there would definitely be a lot of irrelevant criticisms and discussions, disrupting their unified intentions. Now they were talking very speculatively, getting closer step by step, almost side by side, walking on the same road without difference and in sync.</p>
<p>":::This is the best opportunity. My XX Army doesn't easily recruit brothers, especially the famously weak Suzhou people. No one wants them. There are too many deaths on the front lines, and they have to replenish some on the spot."</p>
<p>"But, my father, my mother,:::"</p>
<p>"Pah! In this day and age, who cares about parents? The harvest in the fields is bad, rice doesn't sell for money, and expenses are so high that even a wife is hard to support."</p>
<p>"Hmm!:::" A'gen thought, my wife, precisely because she was hard to support, was given away. That's right, sticking to the countryside until old age is still a poor man. My father is a ready-made example, but there was some fear and worry, saying:</p>
<p>"Fighting is a matter of life and death. Even if you are poor, you are still alive. What's the point of having money if you die?"</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! You are really a fool. If you haven't been to the front line, you will naturally say these things. To be honest, the current fighting is just bad luck with bullets. You are used to seeing Niu Gao and Jin Wushu on the stage, fighting one-on-one. When we fight, we just lie down in hidden places and fire our guns randomly. We don't even see a ghost. When we run out of bullets, we have to retreat. Only when death is looking for you will you be hit by the blind enemy's bullets. Even if you are hit, it's not necessarily death. If you injure a part, it's even better. Sleeping in the wounded soldiers' hospital, tea, water, porridge, and rice are all delivered by nurse小姐 who are as beautiful as flowers. Ha! Ha!::: It's more comfortable than a young master."</p>
<p>"But,:::, I have to tell my parents clearly."</p>

<h3>Complex and Slightly Weak Financial and Gold Market</h3>
<p>(Continued Decline of 2.1 Taels) Yesterday, the market saw some changes with a complex situation. Dealers' wills were hesitant, and the market hovered around the 760 tael mark with limited fluctuations. The total difference between high and low prices was about 5 taels. Ultimately, it continued to fall by 2.1 mace. Initially, the silver market was close to a default, with the decline already exceeding the 60 tael threshold. However, there was talk in the U.S. of resuming the use of gold and silver, which aroused strong intentions from various firms. With the foreign exchange market being normal, gold prices weakened again. The market initially leveled off, then buyers became active, and rumors spread that Bombay had excessive silver reserves and planned to continue selling. The price briefly rose above 60 taels, but many sellers took advantage of this to sell, and the exchange rate and banknotes were strong and leveled off. The fleeting rise was unexpected, and the market softened again. In the end, it only reached a little over 56 taels. The detailed daily report is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Morning Market Advances Then Retreats) The opening price for November was 760 taels and 8 fen, an increase of 2.1 mace. Hengchang, Yongyi, Fengyong, and Yongzhao posted prices and advanced, followed by 61 taels. Due to the dumping by Yuanheng, Fuchang, Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Kangxiang, Yuanchun, Qingfa, and Yongyuantai, and the release of goods, prices immediately fell by 3 to 4 taels. At one point, it went from several qian to 1 tael. Looking back at 9:15 AM, it was 57 taels and 1 qian, and the U.S. dollar seemed to loosen. The current month was 56.25 against the tael, the next three months were 87.5. Then Yuanmao, Yongda, and Decheng bought, and the price returned to 1 tael, reaching 8 taels and 1 qian. At 9:30 AM, the HSBC listing was announced unchanged, at 7 taels and 4 qian. Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongyu, and Changxiang advanced slightly. Banque Belge bought U.S. dollars for January at 68.75. At 9:45 AM, it was 8 taels and 4 qian. The market situation was calm, but with a downward trend.

From 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM, the fluctuations were even smaller. Then suddenly, news of India selling silver spread, and people's hearts were stirred. Yuanheng, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Changfu, Hengyu, and others rushed to buy, and the U.S. dollar also seemed stable, with December traded back and forth at 62.5. As a result, the gold price suddenly became sharp, and at 3:20 PM, it suddenly reached 60 taels and 3 qian. Unexpectedly, many retail sellers seized the opportunity to sell, and Citibank and others released U.S. dollars for January at 62.5. Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, and others all sold. Around 4:00 PM, it was a little over 58 taels. After ten minutes, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Qianchang, Xiangyuantai, Futaiheng, and others continued to sell relentlessly, and the price declined further.

Guangdong small coins were more expensive due to many buyers and a shortage of goods in the market, increasing by 2 li to 6 qian 1 fen 5 li. The price was the same in both the early and mid-markets, with 105,000 coins traded in the early market and 65,000 coins in the mid-market.

<h3>New York Stock Market Rises</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that on Saturday (19th) the New York stock market, with wheat firm and international trade good, all stocks tended to rise. The number of freight cars during the week totaled 536,710, a decrease of 51,290 compared to the previous week. The half-day trading volume totaled 585,556 shares. Stock prices have been greatly affected by the war debt issue. The general public is concerned about what actions Congress will take. There is little clue as to how to solve the war debt problem. Both reluctant payments and non-payment will cause the pound and prices to fall sharply again, so a compromise solution is gradually gaining strength. In addition to war debts, there are also various problems such as unemployment relief, tax increases, domestic debt, and private debt, all of which need to be resolved by the current Congress. At this uncertain juncture, it is quite commendable that the market can stand still. However, investment or speculation should be particularly cautious at present. Attached is the Dow Jones index for the 19th:</p>
<p>|Closing Price|Change from Previous Day|</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>|30 Industrial Stocks|64.14|Up 1.18|</p>
<p>|20 Railroad Stocks|27.87|Up 0.46|</p>
<p>|20 Utility Stocks|28.30|Up 0.38|</p>
<p>|40 Bonds|78.33|Up 0.22|</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: "Yarn" is Stimulated by "Cotton" and Tends to be Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is trending firm, but the actual demand in the market is still weak. However, the rise in raw cotton has stirred up people's hearts. Some short sellers are covering their positions, and the market has risen slightly. However, an examination of various firms reveals that due to financial difficulties, there is unlikely to be a very large development in the short term, so most short sellers still have no intention of covering their positions. Therefore, the yarn market is still weaker than the cotton market.</p>
<p>(Scattered Short Covering) The Renbiao pre-market opened with U.S. cotton falling again, and the prices for each month were flat. The prices for the far months rose, and the market became more expensive due to the rising raw cotton. The closing price was weak again. As a result, each month rose by 1-2 qian. In the afternoon, the market sentiment gradually increased, and the situation became tighter. Each month rose by 7-8-9 qian to 1-2 taels. The total transaction volume for the day was 34,100 bales. It was found that Zhenda sold 1,050 bales, Renfeng 750 bales, Yichang 1,350 bales, Xincheng 900 bales, Tonghe 600 bales, and Jifeng 650 bales. Mingde bought 850 bales, Rongxing 850 bales, Changyu 650 bales, and Xiesheng 800 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market is Highly Bullish as Delivery Approaches</h3>
<p>The cotton market was bullish in the afternoon, with a strong trend. This situation was previously reported in this newspaper due to the lack of sources from various places. However, U.S. cotton continued to fall. However, the delivery deadline for the current month is approaching. A certain manufacturer has thrown out a large amount of money. At present, although the spot cotton price is small, there is fear of not being able to deliver a large batch of spot cotton. Therefore, they are slightly covering their short positions in the near month, and the market has suddenly risen. The far months have all broken through the 2 tael mark. Judging from the overall situation, the situation is also relatively calm. According to the domestic situation, the price in the countryside is high, and the goods arriving are very few. The market may continue to rise.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Market Is Great in the Afternoon) The Zheng Biao pre-market opened with U.S. cotton falling again, causing people's hearts to be flat. However, due to the delivery relationship in the current month, the market rose in the first two or three rounds and then fell again, resulting in no ups and downs. The afternoon market was excellent, and the buying trend was strong. Each month rose by 2-3-4 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 114,800 dan. It was found that Yuanda sold 10,100 dan, Shenchang 3,500 dan, Jifeng 2,200 dan, Yuanda 7,500 dan, and Yifeng 2,300 dan.

<h3>India-England Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>(Bombay) During the past week's trading days, merchants occupied the majority. First, Japanese factories purchased cotton to offset the decline in Japanese gold. Second, the relationship between India and Japan in terms of textiles is not as easy to grasp as the U.S. dollar, so they purchased raw cotton one after another. In terms of import and export transactions, shipping only occurred with Japan, and inquiries were very few. The statistics for the past week are listed below (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>
<p>||1931|1932|</p>

<p>(Liverpool) Spot demand improved this week, but futures were very quiet due to the debt issue. However, the market trended firm due to a favorable report from Memphis. Hedging was absorbed by purchases from colleagues and the Liverpool gang. Egyptian cotton weakened due to poor exports from Liverpool and Alexandria.</p>
<h3>Tight and Then Soft Grain and Rice Market</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from various firms was slightly connected, about 50 arrivals. The inventory in Pudong was not strong. The sales in urban and rural stores were initially tight and then relaxed due to the sunny weather. Changshu and Beishi started to lower prices by 3 jiao. The Suzhou and Tong firms were also short 1-2 jiao. The weather turned cloudy, and the Yuanwu rice had no honor or disgrace, showing a downstream trend.</p>
<p>(New Gate) There was not much rice arriving in the market, about 30 arrivals. The appetite of the stores in this street was lighter than the city, and the situation was in a slump. There was no appetite at all for Wuxi, Jiangyin, Yixing, and other goods, and the price fell by 3 jiao. The Liangchang top goods also fell by 2 jiao, and the Nongdao and Yangdujian rice were sluggish by about 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>The Min Gang Smoothly Handles Passenger Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation remained fair and stable. The inventory in the market was sufficient, and the market originally had a slightly bearish outlook. However, a passenger rice inquiry yesterday stabilized the situation. The passenger Xian rice had active arrivals and sales, and the market was thriving. However, the inventory and arrivals were too high, and the sales could not keep up with the new arrivals. The market sentiment ultimately showed a slight decline of a few points. However, the Quanzhou gang continued the Fuzhou gang in handling business smoothly in the market on Sunday, with a strong appetite. Both the Beibei gang and Fuzhou had continued business. If the future sales path becomes more prosperous, the market should gradually improve. The market opened with 100 bags of Xiaojiao rice, priced at 7 yuan and 8 jiao. 400 bags of Saigon rice were priced at 8 yuan. 700 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice were priced at 8 yuan and 5-6 jiao. 100 bags of Hunan machine-milled oily rice were priced at 8 yuan and 7 jiao. 90 bags of Ji machine-milled rice were priced at 8 yuan and 3 jiao. 230 bags of Ji machine-milled red rice were priced at 8 yuan and 1 jiao. The Saigon rice was handled by this street, the Xiaojiao and Xiang machine-milled rice were handled by the Beibei gang, and the rest were handled by the Min gang.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Again Shows a Good Face</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market had no large ups and downs in the upper and lower markets. The market was initially large and then flat, and the closing price returned to good. At the opening, the foreign wheat price was reported to be 2-3-4 jiao higher, and people's hearts were upward. Then, Australian wheat was still sold at a small price, and a certain factory had wheat arrivals and sold it off, so the market followed and leveled off. Before the closing, a certain large factory had short coverings, and the price returned to the top. However, the spot flour sales were very sluggish, and there were no purchases throughout the day. Because there were many drawals a few days ago, the sales path has been full. Although the North Sea has not been closed yet, it is sticking to it and not handling business. The price is 2.5 jiao lower for this month, 1.5 fen lower for next month, 7.5 fen lower for January, 5 fen lower for February, 2.5 fen lower for March, and 7.5 fen lower for April.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Are Flat in the Morning and Soft in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>| Spot Goods Are Rarely Traded In and Out |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign wheat price was reported to be 2-2-3-4 jiao higher, but because the price of Australian wheat was still low, people's hearts and the market were both flat. In the spot wheat market, there were few trades in and out. There were not many chips in the market. There were only more than 200 cars from inland factories and merchant passengers. The total number of new hedges was less than 1,000 cars. It was difficult to combine the new hedges, and there were no high-priced goods to collect, so both buyers and sellers had no intention of using the gods. The total transaction volume throughout the day was less than 20 cars. The morning was slightly standing, and the afternoon was weak. The closing price was 1 fen lower for this month, 1 fen higher for January, and 1 fen lower for March and April. There were no transactions in December and February.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Returns Firm</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that on Saturday (19th) Chicago wheat rose 1 to 1.125 fen due to short covering. The trading volume on the 18th totaled 30 million bushels. The market prices for the 19th are listed below:</p>
<p>|Closing Price|Change from Previous Day|</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>|December Futures|43.250|Up 1.000|</p>
<p>|May Futures|48.625|Up 1.000|</p>
<p>|July Futures|49.875|Up 1.125|</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The European and American Silk Telegrams Did Not Turn Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was still no development in the foreign silk market in this port. The exchange rate has fluctuated greatly this week. The European and American silk telegrams did not turn yesterday morning. Both Chinese and foreign silk merchants were very negative. Only inland users continued to trade silk, because various silk weaving factories took the opportunity to purchase raw materials in anticipation of the demand for spring silk.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei and Gongxi Plummet Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British and French merchants purchased in small quantities the Zhenmei Gongxi green tea from the incoming merchants. The total sales in the city were more than 800 boxes. The market was not very lonely.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Raw and White Sugar Exchange Increase</h3>
<p>丨丨 Price Increase of Two and a Half Points 丨丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market stabilized with a bid and the subsequent trading became smooth. Consequently, the association visibly brightened. No. 24 raw white sugar generally arrived at 14 taels, 8 mace, 7.5 candareens, an increase of 2.5 candareens compared to the previous day, and trading was brisk. High-quality FWW No. was 14 taels, 9 mace, 2.5 candareens. No. 18 medium white sugar was 14 taels, and No. 20 was 14 taels, 3 mace, with no changes. Dutch Red No. 8 oil bags were 11 taels, 0 mace, 5 candareens to 11 taels, new goods were 11 taels, 5.5 candareens, Dutch Red No. 9 was 11 taels, 5 or 6 candareens, and No. 10 pale yellow was 11 taels, 7 candareens. General cargo of cotton Dutch white saw limited trading, decreasing slightly by 1 mace and 7 candareens compared to the previous day, with a price of 15 taels, 1 mace. There were rumors about Taikoo Sugar yesterday, B Mark was 16 taels, a slight decrease of 5 candareens compared to the previous day, CW was 15 taels, 8 mace, DY Mark was 15 taels, 3 mace, and HX Mark was 15 taels, 1 mace, with no price fluctuations. Jianbing, according to Xiamen telegraphs, is said to be ceasing operations. If so, the future supply will inevitably decrease, and cargo owners hope to raise prices, but due to scattered sales and weak exchange rates, there is no possibility of price increases.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods and Green Cakes Becoming Cheaper Daily</h3>
<p>Since the new green cakes came out, the amount of goods on the market has been gradually increasing recently. However, sales in various places are only so-so, resulting in an oversupply and loosening prices. In addition, various firms are competing to unload their goods, intentionally offering low prices, making the price even cheaper. Yesterday, green cakes were only sold for 4 taels, 3 mace, while the previous market price was 4 taels, 8 mace, a drop of 5 mace. The steamed cakes were sold for 6 taels the previous day, but yesterday a certain firm sold them off for 5 taels, 2 or 3 mace, a drop of 8 mace. The goods stored previously are all said to have suffered losses.</p>

<h3>The National Government Responds to the Northeast Problem</h3>
<p>▲ Song Ziwen Entered Beijing Yesterday Morning to Preside Over Everything</p>
<p>▲ Chiang Kai-shek Will Return to Beijing from Hankou in a Few Days</p>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Yuan held a council meeting in Geneva to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute. The situation was serious. Therefore, the National Government invited all members of the Foreign Affairs Committee and ministers of the Executive Yuan to return to Beijing a few days ago to begin actively responding to the League of Nations. Song Ziwen, acting President of the Executive Yuan, took his wife, Ms. Zhang Leyi, and two daughters, aboard his own Sikorsky aircraft to Beijing at 9:30 yesterday morning to preside over the matter. Zhang Xueliang's advisor, Donald, and secretary Huang Chunjin accompanied him. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, is also a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He is said to have been approved to leave Hankou with his wife and others aboard a warship to return to the capital within a few days to participate in the response work.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways Plans to Purchase Civilian Land in Pengpu, a Meeting Was Held Yesterday to Discuss Methods</h3>
<p>▲ Residents' Representatives Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways, accompanied by Chen Yaozu, Director of the Finance Department, Sa Fujun, Director of the Engineering Department, and Yu, Director of the Business Department (Xia Guangyu did not arrive), visited Mayor Wu Tiecheng of the Shanghai Municipal Government at Fenglin Bridge at 10:00 yesterday morning to discuss issues such as the relocation and expansion of the North Railway Station and the requisition of civilian land. At the same time, Zeng met with Hou Xuanqing and others, representatives of the villages in the Pengpu area that were to be requisitioned. The details of the proceedings are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Situation: At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the Ministry of Railways and the Municipal Government had previously agreed to discuss the problem of residents in the Pengpu area opposing the requisition of land and to implement the plan. Those present included Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways, Chen Yaozu, Director of the Finance Department, Sa Fujun, Director of the Engineering Department, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Shen Yi, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Jin Liren, Director of the Land Bureau, etc. At the meeting, Sa Fujun, Director of the Engineering Department, first explained the joint transportation station plan proposed by the Ministry of Railways and provided detailed maps and drawings. Then, Mayor Wu Tiecheng reported on the situation of residents in the Pengpu area requesting relocation. Afterwards, everyone exchanged opinions and discussed for a long time. As a result, the original plan was slightly revised and implemented according to the plan, and it was decided to acquire civilian land. The Municipal Government ordered the Land Bureau to organize an evaluation committee to estimate the price according to the market price and the most favorable standards, and to purchase it. The meeting adjourned at 12:00.</p>
<p>▲ Petition for Avoidance: Early yesterday morning, Hou Xuanqing and six other representatives of the village chiefs in the Pengpu area that were to be requisitioned brought a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting that the case be compiled and submitted to a consultation meeting. At that time, Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming and others came to visit Mayor Wu. Therefore, the representatives waited to meet Wu and after Wu left, they appealed to him, generally saying that they had repeatedly asked the Ministry of Railways to avoid requisitioning land, but had not received a concrete response, etc. At that time, Zeng and others met them in the reception room and explained that the Ministry of Railways' requisition of civilian land for the North Railway Station was not for the current need for such a large amount of land, but was planned for fifty years. The original plan was to requisition 3,500 mu, but in consideration of the livelihood of the people, the requisition was specially reduced by 700 mu. He also showed a map and pointed out that the land to be requisitioned along the Zhabei Jiaotong Road was planned to be used to move the Wusong engine room there and build a locomotive room, passenger car room, transfer table, parking lot, passenger train room, coal transportation machine, etc. nearby. The land could not be reduced, so he (Zeng) and others were ordered to visit Mayor Wu. In the future, only the land acquisition and price payment could be slightly increased to avoid losses to the landowners. Currently, they are planning to ask the Municipal Government to jointly review the land price there with the Land Bureau and determine the level for purchase. If necessary, a land acquisition evaluation committee can be organized for public evaluation, etc. The representatives felt that there were still no concrete measures, and Zeng and others could not stay for long, so the representatives turned to visit the Mayor.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Municipal Government: Representatives Hou Xuanqing and others visited Mayor Wu and presented a letter stating, "We are writing to petition for the avoidance of villages from the requisition of civilian land for the joint transportation station and to request a concrete response. The two-way joint transportation station is requisitioning civilian land in the Pengpu area. Xuanqing and others, believing that this matter concerns national construction and the people's livelihood, have repeatedly listed the following circumstances and earnestly requested avoidance. However, after more than a month of appeals, your office has not taken concrete measures, and the Ministry of Railways has not given clear instructions. We are deeply afraid. Therefore, we dare to submit another document and earnestly request your honor to consider the difficulties of the people and approve the compilation of the case, submit it to a consultation meeting, and decide to avoid the villages to be requisitioned in the Pengpu area. Before a concrete plan is determined, please order the Land Bureau to temporarily stop surveying, otherwise the public sentiment will be difficult to calm and the situation may easily escalate. Although Xuanqing and others are nominally representatives, it is difficult for us to bear the blame. In addition to stating the details in person, we earnestly plead for a concrete response to comfort the people and relieve their difficulties, which would be a benevolent act. Respectfully presented to Wu, Mayor of Shanghai City, by Hou Xuanqing, Zhao Youting, Zhao Wenxiu, Zhang Zhongxiang, Hou Jingcheng, Tao Wenyuan, and Zhao Zuyan, representatives of the villages to be requisitioned in the Pengpu area." As a result, Wu still instructed them to wait patiently for processing.</p>
<p>▲ Zeng Zhongming Talks to the New Voice News reporter: Yesterday, the reporter met with Zeng and asked for his opinion on the request of the residents of Pengpu to relocate. Zeng said, "The Ministry of Railways and the Municipal Government have made this change to realize the Greater Shanghai Plan. The intention is to prosper Shanghai and seek benefits for the residents of Shanghai. The rumor that 6,000 mu of land is to be requisitioned is not accurate. The actual area to be requisitioned in the first plan is 3,500 mu. Later, due to the relationship between the replacement of vehicles, there was a slight change, and 700 mu were reduced south of Jiaotong Road, totaling 2,800 mu. This area of land will be used to build a very complete main station with locomotive factories, passenger car trains, coal machines, and freight yards. It is planned for 50 years, so the scope of requisition cannot be changed. However, the government has decided to estimate the price and purchase civilian land, and an evaluation committee will be organized in advance to handle this matter. The remaining houses, crops, and other products, as well as construction costs and relocation costs, will be given considerable subsidies, so that the people will not suffer losses. In short, the government is not only considering national construction and local prosperity, but also showing consideration for the people everywhere."</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Gradually Return to Their Former State</h3>
<p>▲ The Japanese People's Joy Can Be Imagined</p>
<p>▲ The Chinese People Are So Forgetful</p>
<p>▲ Cargo Arrives in Crowds: The import of Japanese goods is gradually increasing. In the past three days, three ships, Rokko Maru, Tsukuba Maru, and Ikoma Maru, have carried a total of 45,006 items, including East Sugar, hardware, piece goods, seafood, Western paper, and cement, worth more than one million yuan, which have been unloaded at the Mitsubishi and HSBC wharves. Another part has been transferred to the Yangtze River and transported by Nissin Steamship.</p>
<p>▲ Yangtze River Regular Service: From the January 28th Incident to now, for the past ten months, Japanese ships on the Yangtze River have been running, but there has been no fixed schedule. Their business also seemed to be in a trial voyage state. It was not until October that Japanese goods on the Yangtze River could be loaded openly, and Nissin began to carry passengers and goods. Recently, the number of goods going upstream has increased, and passengers are also taking the ships. Therefore, the company has determined that four ships will be sailing on the Yangtze River regular service, starting with the Loyang Maru, which will depart this morning. There will be one ship every four days, with the Xiangyang Maru, Fengyang Maru, and Nanyang Maru rotating. On the upstream side, it is planned to add another ship.</p>
<p>▲ Ocean Shipping Improving: This year, Japanese ships on the North and South Seas have suffered greatly due to the repercussions of the war. For the past ten months, no Japanese ships on any route have had goods or passengers. If there were no government subsidies, they would have been suspended long ago. It was not until recently that things gradually improved. Japanese ships on the North Seas route have better freight transport than those on the South China route, and the Northeast is even better. Currently, the Dalian Steamship Company, affiliated to the South Manchuria Railway, has four passenger ships and eight cargo ships running from Dalian, Yingkou, and Tianjin to Shanghai. Nissin and Kawasaki have four ships on the Qingdao-Tianjin line. As for the South China route, Osaka and Nissin have a total of five ships. However, the Fuzhou shipping industry has been boycotted, while there has been a slight increase in the transportation of goods to Shantou and Xiamen. In addition, since this month, there have been nine ships traveling back and forth on the Sino-Japanese route, with both imports and exports fully loaded. It has returned to the state before the September 18th Incident. There are now 36 Japanese merchant ships running on the various river and sea routes in Shanghai, with a total deadweight tonnage of 120,000 tons.</p>
<p>▲ Goods from the Northeast: After our country blockaded the Northeast Customs on September 25, Chinese people have stopped purchasing grains from Dalian, Yingkou, and Andong. In October, 2,153 tons of soybeans were transported to various ports in our country, a decrease of 13,551 tons compared to the same period last year. Soybean oil was 416 tons, a decrease of 4,845 tons compared to October last year. There was only one ton of soybean cake, compared to 3,686 tons in October last year. The transportation of goods from the Northeast to the mainland has been severely hit.</p>
<h3>The Joint Committee Has Not Yet Ended</h3>
<p>▲ A Small Number of Japanese Soldiers Are Still Stationed in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>Half a year has passed since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement. A small number of Japanese troops are still stationed in the Wusong Public University Yarn Factory and the Toyota Yarn Factory in western Shanghai. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News met with Mr. Yin Rugeng, a counselor of the Municipal Government. According to him, the Japanese soldiers at Toyota have already withdrawn, and there are still a small number of military police at Public University, who will withdraw on the 28th. However, the Japanese officials' statement on the issue of the withdrawal of troops from the two yarn factories is contrary to the above. It is said that the troops stationed at the Public University Yarn Factory have already been withdrawn, while there are still a small number of sailors stationed at Toyota. As for the statement that they will withdraw on the 28th, they have not heard of it. In addition, the authorities of the Joint Committee believe that even if the troops stationed in the two yarn factories are completely withdrawn, the committee may not be immediately dissolved, because they still have other tasks.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Aids Japanese Residents in China</h3>
<p>▲ Allocates Five Million Japanese Yen for Loans</p>
<p>▲ No Response Yet to the Request to Stop the Japanese United News Agency from Spreading Rumors</p>
<p>Since the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, trade between Japanese merchants in China has plummeted, which has aroused great attention from the Japanese government and the public. Yesterday, the First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy met with a reporter from the Central News Agency. Recently, the anti-Japanese goods movement in various places has not been as strong as before, so trade between Japanese merchants in China has gradually recovered, but it has not yet returned to the state before the incidents, which is gratifying. As for Japanese merchants in China who have suffered significant losses due to the impact of the war, the Japanese government has decided to find ways to subsidize them. The Japanese government has now allocated five million Japanese yen for loans to Japanese residents in China. Shanghai has received three and a half million, and the rest has been distributed to various places. The loan business in Shanghai has already begun. As for the diplomatic note from the National Government requesting the Japanese United News Agency to stop spreading rumors, the embassy has telegraphed the consulate in Beiping to investigate, so there has been no response yet. The person himself has just returned to Shanghai from Nanjing. During this trip to Beijing, he met with Foreign Minister and Vice Minister Liu, etc. The Japanese government's opinion on the League of Nations' investigation report has also been forwarded to your country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Japanese Consul stationed in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Li Guojie Was Released on Bail Yesterday and Sent to Shanghai Hospital</h3>
<p>▲ The Court Will Continue to Hold a Hearing Today</p>
<p>▲ The Court Issued a Summons for Chen Fumu</p>
<p>After Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, was transferred to the local court, his family hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Li Shirei to submit a request to the court for bail for medical treatment. At 9:00 yesterday morning, the two lawyers Jiang and Li accompanied Li's family to the court again to complete the bail formalities. Chief Prosecutor Lou Yingdang approved a reduction to a deposit of 60,000 yuan, with the condition that he be available for questioning at any time. The local court also believed that the matter was of great importance and specially notified the Municipal Government, requesting assistance in handling the case. The Municipal Government ordered An Taidong, an inspector from the Public Security Bureau's Supervision Department, and Ren Shouzhi and Zhang Yong, detectives from the Detective Department, to go to the court. At about 11:00 in the morning, Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying went to the Municipal Government to meet with Mayor Wu and reached an agreement that after being released on bail, Li would be sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment and that the local court and the Public Security Bureau would send police to continue to monitor him.</p>
<p>▲ Sent to the Hospital: At 1:45 p.m. yesterday, Li's agent lawyers Jiang Yiping and Li Shirei paid the bail, which was provided by Taihe Ginseng Company, totaling 60,000 yuan, with the condition that he be available for questioning at any time. The guarantors were lawyer Jiang Yiping. By 3:00 p.m., all the formalities were completed. Li Guojie was escorted by detectives from the Public Security Bureau and court police in a car to the Shanghai Hospital at the Santai Wharf. Li Guojie was in Room 4, First Class, and Room 5 was for his family. Two detectives, Ren Shouzhi and Zhang Yong, from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, four policemen from the First Squadron of the Police Brigade, three policemen from the Second District Branch, and one judicial policeman from the local court were stationed day and night to monitor him.</p>

<h3>The China Merchants Electric Tram Company Has Not Yet Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ The Company Announced Compliance with the Proclamation</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Electric Company workers disobeyed orders and refused to resume work, the workers continued to strike yesterday. Therefore, trams on various routes continued to be suspended. The company on the Chezhan Road and the Gaochangmiao Water Plant are still guarded by the Police Brigade and the Security Brigade, with strict precautions. The Federation of Labor Unions of the First District of the State Goods Road continues to handle official business as usual.</p>
<p>▲ The Labor Union Asks for Instructions: At 9:00 yesterday morning, the striking workers went to the Federation of Labor Unions of the First District of the State Goods Road, requesting the standing directors of the federation to hold a general meeting of all workers to discuss the direction and organize a strike committee. The standing directors and others, believing that the matter was of great importance, not only answered the workers, but also sent the standing directors Chuan Chongde and Hu Yida to the Municipal Party Headquarters at 11:00 a.m. to ask for instructions. Zhou Funong, the director of the Civil Training Section, received them and immediately reported to the Executive Committee. They then advised the labor union to stop holding the meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Decision Method: The Party and government organs, believing that the China Merchants Electric Company workers disobeyed orders and refused to resume work, which was extremely hateful, specially invited the company's directors and managers at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss concrete measures again. Those present were Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Wu Kaixian, member of the Municipal Party Committee, Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Xu Yefu, Section Chief of the Third Section, Jiao Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Du Yuesheng, Director of the Company, Zhang Xiaoliang, and Lu Bohong, Manager. The meeting adjourned at 4:20 p.m. According to the reporter of the New Voice News, two measures were decided: (1) The Municipal Party Committee ordered the Industrial Union of Water and Electricity in the First District to lead the workers to resume work by 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd, otherwise they would be allowed to be dismissed and the activities of the labor union would be suspended. (2) The Municipal Party Committee sent a letter to the Municipal Government, which was then forwarded to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordering the strict arrest of the murderers in the assault on Feng case and the leaders of the strike to be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<p>▲ Limited Order to Resume Work: After the sudden outbreak of the China Merchants Electric Tram Company strike, the authorities believed that the matter concerned the city's transportation and could not be suspended. Therefore, on the one hand, they agreed to discuss the issue of a raise, and on the other hand, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government issued a joint proclamation, limiting all workers to resume work before noon on the 20th. When the time came, all the workers did not obey the order. Yesterday, the Municipal Party Committee ordered the Industrial Union of Water and Electricity in the First District to extend the deadline to 6:00 p.m. on the 23rd. If they disobeyed again, the factory would be allowed to dismiss them. The original text of the proclamation stated: "Order to the Industrial Union of Water and Electricity in the First District, for strict order to comply. In this case, the illegal strike of the union has been proclaimed jointly by the headquarters and the Municipal Government, limiting all members to resume work before 12:00 noon on the 20th of this month. The deadline has now passed, and the union has not complied, which is a contempt for the law and is extremely hateful. This office will immediately impose sanctions, and in consideration of the ignorance of the workers, we are lenient and extend the deadline to 6:00 p.m. on the 23rd. If you continue to disobey, and still do not resume work after the deadline, you will be severely punished and the union will be dissolved. The factory is allowed to automatically dismiss the workers and recruit new workers. In addition to informing the Municipal Government for investigation and ordering the China Merchants Water and Electricity Company to comply, we urgently order the union to comply and resume work within the time limit. Do not be negligent, lest you cause inconvenience. This order is imperative."</p>
<p>▲ Ordering the Company: The Municipal Party Committee simultaneously ordered the China Merchants Water and Electricity Company yesterday, stating, "Order for compliance. In this case, the illegal strike of all workers of the company has been proclaimed jointly by this headquarters and the Municipal Government, ordering them to resume work before 12:00 noon on the 20th of this month. The deadline has now passed, and the union has not complied, which is extremely hateful. Now, in consideration of the ignorance of the workers, we are lenient and extend the deadline to 6:00 p.m. on the 23rd. If they still resist and do not resume work, this headquarters will impose sanctions according to the law and allow the company to automatically dismiss the workers and recruit new workers. In addition to informing the Municipal Government for investigation and ordering the Industrial Union of Water and Electricity in the First District to resume work within the time limit, we urgently order the company to comply. This order."</p>
<p>▲ Directors Visit: A reporter from the New Voice News visited the directors of the China Merchants Electric Company yesterday. According to them, the workers disobeyed government orders and refused to resume work. In addition to announcing compliance with the proclamation, the company has reported to the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau, requesting filing for record. Tonight, they received an order from the Municipal Party Committee, limiting the labor union to lead the workers to resume work tomorrow. They have decided to notify them again. As for dismissing the striking workers and recruiting new workers, they have decided to postpone it for the time being and wait for the Party and government organs to handle it.</p>
<p>▲ Company Notice: The China Merchants Electric Company yesterday announced to all workers, "Notice: According to the joint proclamation issued by the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Committee, workers are required to resume their original positions by 12:00 noon on the 20th. If they dare to disobey, the capital will be allowed to dismiss them and recruit new workers. The workers did not come to resume work at the time, which is obviously a disobedience to the Party and government orders. The company is naturally complying with the handling. This notice is hereby given."</p>

<h3>The Gengkuan Finance Committee Approved the Guarantee for the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Public Debt</h3>
<p>▲ A Total of Three Million Pounds is Required to Complete the Entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chen Yaozu, Director of the Finance Department of the Ministry of Railways, who attended the Finance Committee meeting of the Central Gengkuan Committee, told a reporter from the New Voice News regarding the Ministry of Railways' borrowing of funds from the Central Gengkuan Committee to complete the Longhai and Guangdong-Hankou Railways, that the loan of 2.45 million pounds for the Guangdong-Hankou Railway had been largely approved, except for the loan for the Longhai Railway, which had not yet been finalized. A portion of public debt will be issued with this fund as collateral. A portion of the Sino-British Gengkuan funds is deposited in China, and a portion is deposited in the London Purchasing Committee. The portion deposited in China has been approved by the Finance Committee of the association to be used as collateral to issue 1.2 million pounds of public debt. Another portion in London has not yet been finalized, but it may be possible to obtain 1.25 pounds in cash to avoid paying more interest on the issuance of public debt. The Gengkuan Committee will hold a preparatory meeting on the 3rd of next month and a formal meeting on the 5th. This loan case will be formally approved by the committee. In addition, according to Sa Fujun, Director of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Railways, the section between Shaoguan and Zhuzhou on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is 270 kilometers long, and the entire project is estimated to cost a minimum of more than 3 million pounds.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval and Military Actions</h3>
<p>▲ Flagship Returns Home: The Japanese Navy flagship Izumo of the Third Fleet has been ordered by the Naval Ministry to return to its country.

On the same day, the new Commander, Minei, will take over the flagship and lead the 27th Destroyer Squadron to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Military Police Withdrawal: When Shanghai was occupied, Japan sent a battalion of military police to Shanghai to be responsible for rear security. After the ceasefire, a batch has been withdrawn, and some are still stationed in the Toyota Yarn Factory in western Shanghai and the Public University Yarn Factory. After repeated negotiations with our side, the Japanese side finally agreed to withdraw all of them to Japan on the 28th of this month. Their duties will be taken over by the Japanese police. Zokonji is scheduled to host a farewell banquet for the military police officers at the Sixty-Three Garden today, and invite Tashiro and Sugisaka to accompany them.</p>
<h3>War Reports from Various Northeastern Armies</h3>
<p>Hwa Tung News Agency reports: Zhan Tao, the former commander-in-chief of the Northeastern National Salvation Allied Army, needing to report on the war situation to various sectors and request assistance, specially dispatched representatives Zhang Guowei, Zhou Xunyu, Liu Shi, and Zeng Wowo to Shanghai. They also brought a petition to report everything to the central government. The petition stated (excerpt omitted): "Our country is unfortunate, the Northeast has fallen, and after years of bloody battles, we have recovered half of it. If we do not continue to resist, it will be difficult to shatter the imperialists' ambition to seize our land. Since our army resisted the enemy, although we have experienced all kinds of hardships, our determination to kill the enemy has never wavered. Since the oath-taking ceremony, we have commanded over 43,500 men from the divisions of Zhou Zhang Weiyuan, Wu Delin, Wu Zuohua, Zhang Mingwu, Fei Yonghan, Shi Lingge, Ji Handong, and others to fight bitterly with the enemy in the Jinzhou, Chaoyang, Shenyang, and Xinmin areas. We have twice entered and exited the Shenyang airfield, engaged in hand-to-hand combat more than ten times, and recently killed dozens of enemies and seized various firearms, horses, and military supplies in the Chaoyang Temple, Yixian, and Liu Changtai areas of western Liaoning. However, as autumn goes and winter comes, the frontiers have already frozen over. Officers and soldiers are wearing only thin, tattered clothing, suffering from hunger and cold, and receiving no assistance. Moreover, the enemy, relying on the dismantling of the 'green gauze tents' (referring to the cover of crops), and with their superior equipment and powerful weaponry, have concentrated their elite troops to attack us from time to time. At this time of internal and external difficulties, it is extremely difficult to cope. Although patriotic people and groups in the rear, and overseas Chinese compatriots, have enthusiastically donated, it is ultimately too slow and distant to be of immediate help. After repeated consideration, for the sake of the future of national salvation and the convenience of military operations, we have specially dispatched Zhou Xunyu, Liu Shi, and other representatives of the entire army to enter the customs (referring to the area south of the Great Wall) to present everything in person, and to beg for compassion for their bitter fighting and to provide as much assistance as possible so that our iron-blooded men can have no worries and devote all their efforts to killing the enemy and saving the country, without abandoning their efforts halfway. Then the recovery of the three northeastern provinces can be expected, and 30 million people can once again see the blue sky and white sun, leading with eager anticipation awaiting orders."</p>
<p>Far East News Agency reports: Cao Fengchun, the resident representative in Shanghai of Geng Jizhou, Commander-in-Chief of the Liaoxi Volunteer Army, received a telegram yesterday from the army's office in Peiping (Beijing), stating: "Our Zhou Zhenbang unit occupied Tieling on a cold day and then joined forces with Zhao Yazhou's 10th Detachment. Twenty enemy planes flew in on the 銑 day morning to bomb the city, dropping dozens of bombs, resulting in over 700 civilian casualties. Our artillery positions, located on Dragon Head Mountain, shot down two enemy planes with flat-trajectory guns. However, due to a lack of reinforcements, we painfully gave up Tieling that evening and retreated to the Jiguan Mountain area to defend it, waiting for replenishment before continuing our offensive."</p>
<h3>29th Division Party Department Cables Central Committee Members in Shanghai, Urging Attendance at the Third Plenary Session</h3>

We earnestly request that you attend the meeting, gather at the central government, discuss all plans for national salvation, pacify the interior, resist foreign aggression, and avenge our shame. Everything depends on this action. We respectfully submit this telegram and request your attention. The Preparatory Committee of the Special Party Department of the 29th Division of the Army, sealed with a stamp."</p>
<h3>Direct Train Service on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Lines to Commence Next Autumn</h3>
<p>▲ Ferry "Yangtze" Ordered in England</p>
<p>▲ Expected to Arrive in China Next March</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has decided to build special docks on both sides of the Yangtze River, between Xiaguan and Pukou, where the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou lines are interrupted by the river. The expropriation of land has already been submitted to the Executive Yuan for promulgation and implementation. An order has been placed with England for the ferry "Yangtze" to enable trains to reach either bank of the Yangtze River and directly load the entire train onto the ferry, which will then travel to the tracks on the opposite bank. It is said that the ferry is expected to be shipped to China around March of next year, and installation of the fittings will take about two months. It is estimated that direct train service on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou lines will be fully operational by next autumn. It is said that the total cost is estimated to be over 4 million.</p>

<h3>Huang Naishu Withdraws Resignation</h3>
<p>▲ Postal Finances Have Been Resolved with Remedial Measures</p>
<p>Huang Naishu, the Director-General of the Post Office, previously submitted his resignation repeatedly due to the extreme financial difficulties of the postal service and the arduous task of handling the blockade of postal services in the Northeast, which caused a recurrence of his old illness. Although the Ministry of Communications repeatedly ordered him to stay, Huang was determined to resign and went to Hangzhou for recuperation a few days ago. The post was temporarily handed over to Deputy Director Xu. After Minister Zhu took over the Ministry of Communications, he telegraphed Huang to Beijing last week, earnestly persuading him to stay and discussing in detail ways to improve the postal service and remedy financial difficulties. Huang was moved by Minister Zhu's sincere words and, having discussed appropriate remedial measures for the financial problems, agreed to withdraw his resignation. He is now back at his post, working as usual. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Huang at the Post Office yesterday and inquired about the remedial measures for the postal finances. According to Director Huang, since the blockade of postal services in the Northeast, annual losses have amounted to over two million, causing significant financial difficulties for the postal service. It has now been decided to implement austerity measures internally and strive for business development externally in order to remedy the situation. If the situation in various parts of the country becomes peaceful, the development of business will be easier, and revenues and expenditures should be able to offset each other. As for the postal workers from the Northeast who have entered the customs, nine out of ten have already arrived and are being assigned to post offices across the country, awaiting the day when the lost territories of the Northeast are recovered, so they can return to work.</p>
<p>▲ Significant Funds Are Needed to Raise Rice Prices</p>
<p>▲ Three Difficulties Must Also Be Considered</p>
<p>▲ The Agricultural Bank Plans to Implement Temporary Mortgage Measures</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: This year's rice harvest in Jiangsu Province has been bountiful, but grain prices have plummeted. The Agricultural Bank is seeking assistance from Shanghai's banking community to prevent the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Banks in Shanghai, facing their own economic downturns due to the recession in the interior, have agreed to provide assistance to the Agricultural Bank. Yesterday, Wang Zhixin, the director of Jiangsu Farmers Bank, told reporters that although the banks in Shanghai have expressed their willingness to help the Farmers Bank, adjusting the grain price cannot be solved with a few million dollars. Providing loans to store rice would be difficult to execute due to security and storage concerns. The outlet for future sales must also be taken into account. While the situation is urgent, the matter must be considered with caution to ensure practical results.</p>
<p>▲ A Large Amount of Funding Is Needed: The current emphasis is on regulating rice prices. Jiangnan counties are the major rice-producing areas in our province, and some Jiangbei counties also grow rice, therefore, although there is no detailed survey, the total harvest is quite large. Take Wuxi County as an example, which yields around 1 million dan. At a price of five yuan per dan, 5 million yuan must be loaned in order to facilitate storage. To raise the market price, all the rice in the market must be sold to have the effect. So, one county needs millions of yuan, and if more universal efficacy is needed, the amount of funding needed is obviously larger.</p>
<p>▲ Three Difficulties: The matter is critical to the survival of rural areas, so even if broad effectiveness cannot be achieved, maximum effort must be made. Three difficulties must be considered: 1. Storage Facilities: Calculated reasonably, each warehouse must store rice worth 50,000 yuan to cover costs and interest expenses. In order to facilitate distribution, each room could hold 120 dan. At 5 yuan per dan, that would be 600 yuan per room, so 50,000 yuan would require 100 rooms. It will be easy to resolve in counties that already have large-scale warehouses, but in places where they don't exist, finding such large spaces will not be easy. 2. Security: Loans are provided and warehouses can be resolved, the creditors and guarantee is a big problem in counties without this equipment. While Shanghai banks are not purely focused on profits, it seeks security for the initial investment. All banks agreed to cooperate with the Agricultural Bank, and it can be handled in areas where there is equipment. 3. Security: If the above two problems are completely solved, farmers facing imminent conditions could rush to steal rice which is a situation that must be resolved.</p>
<p>▲ Implementation Criteria: The Agricultural Bank does not ignore its important tasks due to concerns about excessive funding. The Agricultural Bank has drafted temporary measures to assist counties in handling rice mortgage, which will be distributed to counties and branches for implementation in a standardized manner. In areas like Su, Chang, and Xi in Jiangnan, contracts have been signed with various banks, and active progress is being made. Although some areas in Jiangbei are also making progress due to earlier harvests, only a few benefits go to small farmers. Small-time merchants will also benefit.</p>
<p>▲ Branch Plans: When Director Wang was speaking, Shan Songlin and Xu Hanshou, the directors of the Yandu and Rugao Agricultural Bank branches, also visited and reported on the local situation and the progress of rice price regulation. Director Wang explained the main purpose of regulating food for the people and instructed them to carefully plan for overall coordination.</p>
<p>▲ Mortgage Measures: Temporary measures for the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank to assist counties in handling rice mortgages: 1. The bank expands existing warehouses to regulate food for the public. Counties producing rice can partner with this bank if they want to handle rice mortgages. 2. Counties planning to handle rice mortgages should find suitable housing, recommend responsible personnel, and submit a letter of notification, as well as raise a sufficient amount of capital (at least 20,000 yuan) to deposit with the bank. The bank will then provide matching capital equal to twice the amount received. 3. After the warehouse is established, the Agricultural Bank is responsible for receiving, disbursing, and accounting, while the local government is responsible for management and safekeeping. Monthly reports will be submitted, and both parties may conduct checks at any time to ensure clarity. 4. When recovering the principal and interest, the funds from the Agricultural Bank should be repaid first. 5. When farmers take out mortgages from the warehouse, the price will be calculated at 70% of the market price, with a maximum monthly interest rate of 1%. Handling fees and other expenses may be added based on local conditions. 6. The Agricultural Bank's matching funds will be calculated at a monthly interest rate of 8%, and any surplus after expenses are deducted will be used for local public welfare. 7. Farmers' rice mortgages are limited to their own produce, and the mortgage procedures will be handled in accordance with the bank's warehouse regulations. 8. These measures are applicable until January 22nd.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Associations Discuss the Difficulty of Establishing a Grain Storage Fund</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, various rice industry associations in Shanghai held a joint representative meeting at Cuixiu Hall in the City God Temple. Attendees included Gu Xin-yi, Chen Zi-yi, Qiang Zi-sheng, Zhu Xiang-sheng, and She Bing-wen from the Bean and Rice Merchants Association; Cai Yu-kun, Xie Xi-lin, Zhou Yu-ting, and Luo Rong-zhou from the Miscellaneous Grains and Oilseed Cake Association; Zhu Zi-xiang and Fu Qian-geng from the Rice Milling Industry Association; Lu Wen-shao and Zhang Nian-xuan from the Rice Shop Association; Yan Xiao-quan from the South Shanghai Rice Merchants Association; Zhang Cheng-qian and Rong Guan-sheng from the Changshu Rice Merchants Association; and Jiang Shi-zhi from the Rice and Grain Sales Association. Gu Xin-yi was elected as the chairman and reported on the meeting's purpose, stating that recent reports indicate the municipal government is actively preparing to establish grain storage facilities, and the plan is to have the associations advance 300,000 yuan from the previously proposed voluntary donation of five cents per stone of silver for the storage fund, as well as funds for purchasing and storing rice, in order to purchase rice and other grains. He stated that the voluntary donation method had been decided by the seven-group joint conference, but the current price of rice is now extremely low and it is difficult to meet the original plans so the current state should be investigated to prepare for the plan. The decision was made and voted upon:</p>
<p>"The case occurred around July of this year, when the overstock of foreign rice caused prices to fall to just over nine yuan per stone. Merchants were facing bankruptcy so it was suggested that the storage should be mortgaged. If there was a profit, it was to be allocated toward the warehouse fund. However, the situation did not come to fruition and now the price has fallen to seven. Many merchants have suffered great losses and the rural economy has declined. Given these conditions, it will be difficult to ask for donations. In order to support the economy, it would be better for customs to charge a storage fee for any foreign rice. If foreign rice is charged at 5 cents per bag, that would earn a substantial amount in less than six months. It was decided that the proposal be sent to the city's grain committee and implemented."</p>

<h3>Wenzhou Association Cables to Stop Liu Military Adjustment to Zhejiang</h3>
<p>After hearing the news that Liu Zhennian's unit was transferred to Eastern Zhejiang, the Wenzhou Association in Shanghai cabled the Military Affairs Committee of the Military Affairs Department, saying: "We have heard that Liu Zhennian has been transferred to eastern Zhejiang. News of the transfer has frightened the local people. Eastern Zhejiang is currently peaceful and tranquil, and the resident security forces are sufficient to maintain order. There does not seem to be a need to add heavy troops, and the sudden increase of tens of thousands of visiting troops, with language barriers and different customs, could cause misunderstandings and incidents. We humbly request that Liu's troops be transferred elsewhere to reassure the people. Yours most urgently, Wenzhou Association in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Southern Fujian Anti-Japanese Association Donates Large Sum to Northeastern Volunteer Army</h3>

<h3>Fisheries Group Leaders Visited Chen Gongbo Yesterday Requesting Tax Repeal</h3>
<p>Industry Minister Chen Gongbo came to Shanghai a few days ago and invited leaders of fisheries organizations to meet with him. Yesterday morning, Zhang Shenzhi, Fang Jiaobo, Dai Yongtang, Wu Zhenxin, Li Chunfang, Chen Junbo, and others met at the Trademark Office on Avenue Albert. Minister Chen first described the government's objectives in establishing fisheries taxes, advocating streamlining the tax rules, consolidating other cumbersome taxes, and setting the maximum tax at 5%, which could now be reduced to 2%. He stated that the tax funds would be managed by a committee and still be used for fisheries development projects. Zhang Shenzhi and others then spoke, describing the suffering of the fishermen, stating that reimposing the fish tax, which had been clearly abolished by the National Government, was unbearable and that, based on past examples, the tax revenue was very small, while the expenses of the agency would be large, causing unnecessary disruption. They requested that it be exempted. They also discussed the dispute between the two sides of the Chongming County cuttlefish net cage capture case. Minister Chen tasked the Mediation Committee of Various National Bodies in Shanghai with seeking a peaceful and fair judgment and achieving a proper resolution.</p>

<p>According to the *National News Agency*, Xu Shiying and others, the legal representatives of the Anhui Association in Shanghai, filed a private prosecution in the Shanghai First Special District Court against Yang Shucheng, Quan Shaowu, Wang Fanwu, and Zha Liangzhao, four relief personnel of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, due to the Anhui North Relief dispute. Subsequently, on October 4th, Xu Shiying entrusted lawyer Li Shirui to request the withdrawal of his personal participation. Another case was filed by the association to supplement the representative to litigate. The court has been opened twice. The three defendants, Yang, Quan, and Wang, were all in other places, and Zha Liangzhao was far away in Beiping, so none of them appeared in court. Now, the First Special District Court has scheduled a public hearing for today (the 22nd) at 2 PM in the Second Criminal Court of the court. All four defendants, Yang, Quan, Wang, and Zha, have also traveled to Shanghai to respond to the lawsuit. Zha Liangzhao believes that the truth of this case should be investigated, and it is related to the future of relief work, public morals, and people's hearts, which is of utmost importance. Zhou Lisheng and Gao Yihan, members of the Control Yuan, had previously filed an impeachment regarding this dispute. Now that it is being resolved through law, the true facts will not be difficult to reveal. Zha has specifically telegraphed Control Yuan members Gao and Zhou, and sent letters inviting charitable organizations to send representatives to attend and observe at the time. The original letter is recorded below.</p>
<p>Respectfully, in recent years, the weather has changed, and disasters have become prevalent. The people's livelihood is suffering in every way, especially last autumn when floods in the Jianghuai region inundated houses and caused people and animals to flee. The disaster was severe, and the suffering was deep. At that time, rescuing the wounded, comforting the dead, and helping the poor and needy relied on the enthusiastic donations of kind-hearted people in society and the tireless efforts of various charitable organizations. Therefore, sincerity was invoked, and support was gathered. Once trust was established, mutual trust naturally arose. It was only with sparks of fire that we could rely on this. For years, Liangzhao has followed Mr. Yu Qiao in providing relief to Shaanxi and Gansu. The sight was heartbreaking. I decided to temporarily abandon my educational duties to work for my compatriots who had no one to turn to, doing my best to run around and risking my life, unwavering in this determination. When the National Government established the Flood Relief Committee last autumn, Liangzhao was hired as the director of the Emergency Relief Department, devoting himself to public service without daring to be negligent. Looking back, I can face the heavens. However, the legal representatives of the Anhui Association in Shanghai have used the Anhui North Relief matter to make far-fetched accusations and filed a private prosecution against Liangzhao and colleagues of the Flood Relief Committee in the Shanghai First Special District Court. The court has now scheduled a hearing for 2 PM this month (the 22nd) in the Second Criminal Court of the court. The truth will be revealed immediately. Liangzhao and Yang Shucheng, Quan Shaowu, and Wang Fanwu have all traveled to Shanghai to await the hearing. This case is of utmost importance to the future of relief work, public morals, and people's hearts. At that time, please ask your organization to send representatives to the court to observe, so that the truth may be revealed and the "basin" [of injustice] may be cleared. Future charitable workers may not be suspected and feared, which would be fortunate. Zha Liangzhao bows in respect.</p>
<p>Consolidation and Postal Plan Not Yet Finalized</p>
<p>Since the Postal Economic System Research Committee began meeting, it has not made any concrete decisions regarding the postal economic system plan. Recently, after Zhu Jiahua's new appointment as Minister of Transportation, the committee specially dispatched committee members Wang Wenwei and Shen Yangwu to Beijing to meet with Minister Zhu to discuss postal economic issues, exchange views, and present a report on the postal economy. Minister Zhu, due to his busy schedule in recent days, did not have time to consider the matter in detail. Being newly appointed, he has not yet thoroughly researched the postal economic system and was unable to make any rash decisions. Therefore, he instructed the two commissioners, Wang and Shen, to return to Shanghai first. He will consult again in the coming days. Shen and Wang have returned to Shanghai and reported to the Postal Research Committee.</p>
<p>Record of the Shanghai Accountants Association Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting</p>
<p>▲ Liquidation to be Concluded in Six Months in Principle</p>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants Association convened its fifth joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees yesterday. The following members attended: Wang Haifan, Yu Xiji, Li Wenjie, Zhao Zuwei, Lu Yangchun, Jiang Wanping, Xia Sunhuan, Yang Daxun, He Yuanming, and Ye Danian. Xu Junxi attended as an observer.</p>
<p>(1) The meeting opened as usual.</p>
<p>(2) Committee Member Zhao Zuwei chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>(3) Report of the Standing Committee: A, B, C, D.</p>
<p>A letter was received from the Jiangsu Higher Court regarding the account books of the Zhen Tai Money Exchange, managed by member Yang Daxun, requesting that they be turned over. After copying and forwarding the letter to member Yang for review, he replied requesting that the Association invite the introducer of the case to attend the meeting to provide evidence and resolve the matter in accordance with the law. The meeting discussed how to handle the case and decided to reply to the Higher Court to send the account books for transfer. Although the issue of the commission had been determined, the decommissioning procedures had not been completed. The managing accountant still has responsibility for the safekeeping of the account books. When should they be returned? Please inquire and reply for compliance. E.</p>
<p>Member Xu Diaoxi sent a letter stating that he and lawyer Chen Honglai jointly handled the liquidation and settlement of the Unified Hotel. A lawsuit arose due to the member's seal on the notes issued by the receiver. After three trials, it was ruled that he should bear the responsibility for the notes. The letter requested a discussion of relief measures. The meeting decided to refer the matter to the Standing Committee for planning effective relief measures. F.</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Member Jiang Wanping proposed that members handling liquidation cases should conclude them within the statutory six-month period and report the handling and conclusion to the Association for evaluation and to demonstrate trustworthiness. The meeting decided that the proposal was profound and of great importance. It should solicit the opinions of all members. Whether to convene a members' meeting should be seriously discussed. Opinions should be submitted within two weeks, and then the joint meeting will discuss them. G, H. Briefly stated.</p>
<p>(4) The meeting approved the application of accountant Lu Zongwei to join the association. The following is the proposal of accountant Jiang Wanping: In view of the fact that liquidation cases involve the interests of hundreds of people and that even slight negligence on the part of the handlers can have significant consequences, and since our members are committed to serving society, they should demonstrate sufficient dedication and trustworthiness in handling such cases. They must follow the Company Law, the General Principles of the Civil Code, and various liquidation regulations to complete the case within six months. If there are necessary circumstances that require an extension, they should report the reasons for the extension to the Association in accordance with the law. They should also report the start and end dates and all handling circumstances to the Association to show whether the handling is legal and to avoid negligence. In recent years, people in Shanghai have been alarmed and suspicious upon hearing the announcement of a liquidation case. This is because they do not understand the meaning of liquidation. In this situation, if we do not gradually give society a reasonable understanding of handling this type of</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>case, it would be impossible to maintain social stability. Therefore, I propose that this matter be brought to the meeting for discussion and implementation. It is my sincere hope. Proposer: Supervisory Committee Member Jiang Wanping.</p>

<p>Truth About the Killing of a Foreign Goods Store Manager by a Customer</p>
<p>▲ Statement of the Deceased's Brother at the Morgue</p>
<p>At about 9 PM the day before yesterday, Wang Zhengtao, a native of Zhenjiang and 32 years old, the manager of Maotai Foreign Goods Store at 310-312 Xinzha Road, was shot in the waist and killed by two customers in the store. Two bombs were also thrown in the store, but they did not explode. At that time, the two men saw that their purpose had been achieved and fled without a trace. These details were recorded in this newspaper the day before yesterday. After receiving the report, the Xinzha Police Station sent detectives Zong Weiting and others to investigate and transported the body to the Piren Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Court and appointed Prosecutor Zhan Liangce, together with forensic scribe Wang Zuyi and others, to come to the morgue to examine the body and conduct an official inquiry. According to the statement of the deceased's brother, Wang Zhenghai, two men came to buy bedsheets that day. The shop assistant took out a bolt of cloth for them to inspect. They asked which factory produced it. The shop assistant said that it was produced by Lunchang. Then they shot my brother and threw bombs. After obtaining the statement, Zhan ordered that the deceased Wang Zhengtao, male, was indeed shot in the waist and killed before his death. The police station was instructed to arrest the murderers and bring them to justice. The body was handed over to the deceased's brother, Wang Zhenghai, to be collected for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>
<p>Autopsy After the Tragic Death of Zhou Ziyou</p>
<p>Zhou Ziyou, a 47-year-old native of Hubei, residing at No. 1046 Siwen Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha Road, took a newly made suit to a tailor shop for alterations around 8 AM on the 19th of this month because it did not fit him. After the alterations, he returned home. When he arrived at the back door of his house, an assailant suddenly appeared, drew a pistol, and fired a shot at Zhou, hitting him in the head. Zhou immediately fell to the ground unconscious after being injured. The assailant fled the scene. After being seen by someone, the Xinzha Police Station was immediately notified and dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate and transported Zhou to the hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after. The body was transported to the Piren Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Zhan Liangce, along with forensic scribe Wang Zuyi, to come to the morgue to examine the body and conduct an official inquiry. According to the statement of the deceased's wife, Zhou Li, a 29-year-old native of Yangzhou, the deceased was her husband. He worked at the Red Swastika Society Hospital. She had not yet gotten up when the incident occurred, so she did not know what happened at first. After obtaining the statement, Zhan ordered that the deceased Zhou Ziyou, male, was indeed shot in the head and killed before his death. The body was handed over to the deceased Zhou Li for collection and burial. The police station was instructed to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>Negotiations on Penalties for Inventory Form</p>
<p>▲ Letter from the Mechanical Industry Association to the Stamp Tax Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical National Goods Factory Association sent a letter to the Stamp Tax Bureau yesterday, stating, "We are writing to you because our member, Renchangyong Material Factory, stated in a letter that their Second Distribution Office (address: west end of Jiuqu Bridge, Yu Garden Road, Yemiao) was inspected by the Stamp Tax Bureau the other day, and two sets of inventory forms were taken away. These inventory forms are loose-leaf pages that do not record cash inflows and outflows or have price tags. They only record the quantity of goods. They do not have the effect of accounting records and are different in nature from various account books, so there is no need to affix stamps. Unexpectedly, the bureau imposed a fine of 20 yuan and ordered the First District and Second Office to implement it, which goes beyond the stamp tax regulations. Moreover, many Shanghai manufacturers use this type of inventory form, and they have never affixed stamps because they do not record money or serve as vouchers. The Stamp Tax Bureau has also inspected and recognized that there is no need to affix stamps in the past, so our factory ignored it. This time, we were fined and are unwilling to accept it. Therefore, we specifically state the reasons in a letter and earnestly request your association to uphold justice and strive for reasons to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants, and attach three inventory forms from our factory for your reference, and also request the Stamp Tax Bureau's Review Committee to review them again, and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to give us assistance. We would be grateful.</p>
<p>We have received the letter and checked the inventory forms used by the factory. They only have the effect of checking the quantity of inventory on a daily basis and do not record money. They are neither vouchers nor account books. After careful examination of the temporary regulations on stamp tax, none of the items listed can be compared with them. Modern stores have this type of form for management and auditing purposes. Its nature is similar to private diaries or organizational reports. If it is also necessary to affix stamps, it would be harsh and disruptive to business, which is not the intention of the legislation. We believe that social conditions are progressing day by day, and the methods of industrial and commercial management are becoming more complete. The forms used for investigation and auditing in management are also becoming more complex. Those with a little common sense can know this. Your bureau is a national tax collection agency and should not lack understanding. The punishment of the factory's inventory forms may be a temporary misunderstanding. According to the letter, we are enclosing two inventory forms used by the factory and send them to you for your information. We hope that you will check and exempt them from punishment in order to uphold the public order and safeguard the legal interests. We also ask for a reply.</p>
<p>Wang Aoxi Escorted to the Public Security Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>Wang Aoxi, a native of Sichuan, was arrested along with Jiao Daosong, a counselor of a certain military organization in Nanjing, for organizing the Lishi Society and engaging in reactionary activities. The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent officers to cooperate with the police in arresting them at the China Hotel on Guizhou Road, and various manuscripts were seized. The Higher Second Branch of the Court ordered that Jiao be handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation and Wang be detained for further investigation. The presiding judge of the Higher Second Branch of the Court, Yu, continued the trial in court yesterday. The lawyer representing the Municipal Public Security Bureau still requested that the case be transferred for punishment. The lawyer representing the police station stated that the Public Works Department had no objection to the transfer, but the defendant hired a lawyer to oppose the transfer. The lawyers debated fiercely, and in the end, the court approved the request of the Public Security Bureau's lawyer and ordered that Wang Aoxi be handed over to the Public Security Bureau officers in court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhu Lu, a resident of Zhujia Dang, northeast of Yangjia Town, 27th District, Nanhui County, is 32 years old. Her husband died seven years ago. She observed chastity and served her aunt, which was praised by relatives and party members. On the 19th of this month, at 7:30, more than ten robbers suddenly came to her house and robbed her of 150 yuan in cash and five pieces of clothing. Before leaving, they actually kidnapped Zhu Lu. Two of the thieves were known to the woman's aunt. One of them was Zhu Ahai, a nephew of the aunt. After Zhu Lu was kidnapped, there was no trace of her. The aunt thought that her widowed daughter-in-law had been diligently keeping her chastity for seven years, but now she was being abducted and forced into marriage. She went out to inquire and learned that Zhu Ahai was familiar with Zhou Huiqing. She went to Zhou's house to inquire and indeed found Zhu Ahai and Zhou Meisheng there. She handed them over to Officer Wu of the Public Security Bureau. It was originally agreed that they would be interrogated at the bureau at 3 PM on the 20th. When the aunt went to wait for the interrogation, the two criminals had already been bailed out by the district director Zhang Jichang. The aunt thought that her widowed daughter-in-law was missing, and the two criminals had been bailed out. She did not know when the case would be solved. She now plans to hire a lawyer to sue the county government.</p>

<h3>The Society's Attention on the Yun Huifang Appeal Case</h3>
<p>▲ Yu Huating, Presiding Judge, Heard the Case Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ The Yongchang Bombing Was Absolutely Not Done by Yun</p>
<p>▲ Injured Yu Ruiliang Did Not Appear in Court</p>
<p>▲ Next Hearing Requires Supplementary Summons for Doctor</p>
<p>Sixteen-year-old Changzhou youth Yun Huifang, since the January 28th Incident when the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, abandoned his printing business, generously joined the army, devoted himself to the volunteer army, and fought against the enemy with a rifle. Later, when our army retreated to the second defense line due to lack of reinforcements, Yun retired. However, he still contacted comrades and worked hard against Japan. Soon, out of hatred for the unscrupulous merchants who only sought private gain and openly sold enemy goods, destroying the boycott movement, he organized the "Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group" to investigate traitorous shops. If it was found that they were indeed selling enemy goods, a warning letter was first sent. If they still refused to repent, they were "gifted" with a bomb. Therefore, since July, there have been numerous奸商in this city who have received warnings. On the evening of August 2nd, Yun threw a bomb into the Maochang Foreign Goods Store on Rue de la Republique in the French Concession. His actions were careless, leading to his interception by Chinese police in the Chinese territory. Subsequently, he was taken away by the French Concession Police and sentenced to two months of imprisonment by the Second Special District Local Court. Considering that he was still a minor, a suspended sentence was announced in accordance with the law. Before the case was concluded, the Public Concession Police applied to the Second Special Court for his extradition, claiming that the "Blood Soul Group" warning letter received by the Cotton Cloth Guild on Shanxi Road on July 27th, a bomb, and the bomb thrown into Yongchang Coal Store on Xinzha Road on July 28th, injuring shop assistant Yu Ruiliang, were all done by Yun and his gang. The Second Special Court then approved the extradition, and he was transferred to the First Special District Local Court for repeated trials. In the end, the court ruled that Yun was exempt from prosecution for the part of the charge related to the letter to the Cotton Cloth Guild, and sentenced him to three months of imprisonment for the part of the Yongchang bombing that injured people. However, Yun, upon hearing the verdict, argued that the Yongchang bomb was actually thrown by someone surnamed Cai, and he was not present at the scene. Someone had testified to this, so how could he be held responsible for someone else's actions? He immediately consulted his pro bono lawyers, Shen Junru, Li Zuyu, and Zhao Chen, to draft a petition, stating the reasons for his dissatisfaction with the original verdict and appealing to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, seeking redress. The hearing was scheduled for yesterday afternoon in the court's First Criminal Tribunal. The outside world attached great importance to this case, so starting around 1 p.m. yesterday, those going to listen were already arriving one after another. Shen Jiayi, the president of the High Court Second Branch, fearing that the audience seating, if unrestricted, would lead to overcrowding in the courtroom, affecting order, specially dispatched Chinese and Western police officers, along with police inspectors and bailiffs, to be stationed inside and outside the court, to provide extra protection. Three or four bailiffs were stationed at each of the front and back entrances, strictly checking those entering and exiting. All irrelevant people were politely refused entry, so there was no overcrowding in the courtroom. There were only a hundred or so people in the audience, mostly young people, with more than ten women. The order was maintained. At 2:30 p.m., when the case was called, Yun Huifang, upon hearing his name, slowly entered the court from the waiting room, calmly standing within the railing. Judge Yu Huating asked about his age, place of origin, address, and occupation. Then, he ordered him to state the reasons for his appeal due to dissatisfaction with the original verdict. Yun then confessed that the bombs for the Cotton Cloth Guild and Maochang were sent by him, but the Yongchang bomb was actually sent by someone surnamed Cai. Although Cai had discussed it with him the night before, the next morning, he had not gotten up yet, and Cai had gone alone with the wrapped bomb. Our purpose was only to warn, with absolutely no intention of hurting people. After I retired from the army, I brought back two bombs, one was given to the Cotton Cloth Guild, and one was used at Maochang. Therefore, the Yongchang bomb was Cai's. The discussion the night before was also a decision to give it as a gift. Unexpectedly, when I arrived the next day, something had already happened, and someone had been injured. But this fact has nothing to do with me, so I am not satisfied with the original verdict. As for Yongchang's private sale of Japanese goods, it had been investigated beforehand, and a warning letter was first sent. That letter was also handwritten by Cai. The court then threw the drawn map of the accident site to him for review and asked him how the bomb was thrown at the time. Yun still firmly insisted that since he was not present at the scene, he absolutely did not know. Then, a Western detective reported that the map was drawn by him. Yu Ruiliang, who was injured, was seen by him after he recovered in the hospital. However, he is not present in court today. Seeing that there was no other witness besides this, the court ordered the start of the debate. The police lawyer Li Zhishan was about to stand up and speak, but the appellant's three lawyers, Shen, Li, and Zhao, requested a postponement, to summon the doctor from Renji Hospital and the witnesses who had testified during the preliminary hearing that Yun Huifang was not present when the Yongchang bomb was thrown, so that the case could be clarified. Lawyer Shen also said that the injury report submitted by the police regarding Yu Ruiliang's injuries was too brief and unsigned. In order to clarify and ensure accuracy of whether this report was issued by Renji Hospital, he requested that the hospital's doctor be ordered to testify in court. Judge Yu, after consulting with the two assessors Zhao and Guo, approved the appellant's request, ordering the case to be adjourned, with a supplementary summons for witnesses to testify before a further hearing.</p>
<h3>The Journalists' Association Submits a Letter to the Ministry of Railways, Requesting Further Investigation of Chen Xinghan</h3>
<p>The News Journalists' Association of this city previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Railways, requesting the investigation and punishment of Chen Xinghan, the director of the two railway bureaus, for insulting Xu Shen and Wu Dong, members of the association. Five decades have passed since, and no action has been taken. Yesterday, the association specially submitted another letter to the Ministry of Railways, reiterating the previous request. The original letter stated: "Submitting a letter regarding the insult of news journalists by Chen Xinghan, the director of the two railway bureaus, reiterating the previous request, requesting a prompt and thorough investigation. It is found that Chen Xinghan, director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, interfered with the news gathering of Xu Shen and Wu Dong, members of the association, when Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan's special train arrived in Shanghai on August 6th this year, even to the point of shouting at and driving them away. This was not only a public insult to the personalities of news journalists but also a disregard for the government's intention to support and value the news industry. On September 29th this year, a letter was submitted to your department requesting a thorough investigation. More than five decades have passed without a reply, and Chen Xinghan is still enjoying his position as an official and has not changed his old habits. The members of this association are deeply alarmed. Shanghai is connected to international opinion, and those in charge of road administration should understand the overall situation. Yet Chen Xinghan insisted on maintaining his bureaucratic bad habits and scolded news journalists. The recklessness and absurdity of his actions are not only a stain on road administration but also bring shame to the nation. Today, the postal, telecommunications, and transportation sectors all provide convenience to the news industry. The government's aim to support the news is certainly not exclusive to railways. The members of this association feel the pain deeply and are treading on thin ice. Having no choice, we specially reiterate the previous request, imploring your department to promptly conduct a thorough investigation, in order to preserve the dignity of government orders and to curb the tyranny of road administration officials, for the public's benefit. Respectfully submitted to Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways by Qian Cangshuo, Yu Kongwo, Yan Esheng, Qu Shaoyi, and Ma Chonggan, standing committee members of the Shanghai News Journalists' Association."</p>
<h3>Gao Agen Was Shot at Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Hit in the Waist by a Bullet, Not Seriously Injured</p>
<p>▲ Four Thugs Fled the Scene</p>
<p>Gao Jusheng, a native of Shaoxing (nickname: Pockmarked Agen), thirty-two years old, resides at No. 3 Sande Lane, corner of Route Sayzo in the French Concession. He started his career by running inns and has a modest family fortune. Anle First Inn in Taiyuan Lane, Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, and Anle Second Inn in Aiduoli, Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, are both opened with Gao's sole investment. Gao also has considerable investments in the hotel industry in Tianjin and Hankou. He had just arrived in Shanghai from Hankou a week ago. At 6:15 p.m. yesterday, Gao took his own car to Anle First Inn in Taiyuan Lane. Unexpectedly, as the car stopped and Gao stepped out of the car, just entering the main alley of Taiyuan Lane, before he had taken a few steps, a thug suddenly rushed up from the front, drew a handgun from his sleeve, and fired two shots at Gao. One bullet hit Gao's left waist. Gao knew something was wrong and quickly drew his self-defense handgun to resist. Later, seeing many people in the alley, fearing that he might injure innocent people, he did not fire. The thug took the opportunity to flee in a hurry through the back door of No. 5, exited through the front door of Sanhelou, and fled north towards Xixinqiao Street, disappearing without a trace. However, there were three other thugs waiting nearby. Seeing that the situation was not good, they also fled north into the Public Concession. Subsequently, Anle Inn personnel heard the news and rushed out, helping Gao into the car and driving directly to Gao's residence in Sande Lane, then to a hospital for treatment. It is reported that he only suffered a skin injury and there was no damage to internal organs, so there is no danger to his life. Afterwards, some people said that Gao had feuded with others because of the Red Pill Flower Society, but these are all speculations, and the truth is still difficult to ascertain.</p>

<h3>Convicted Bandit Gang Plots Jailbreak</h3>
<p>▲ Police Handgun Almost Snatched Away</p>
<p>▲ The Uncontrollable Nature of Fierce Bandits Is Evident Here</p>
<p>Hua Tanmu (Chinese detective chief) Shang Wu of the Huishi (Combined Districts) Police Station received a report at 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd of last month, saying that a number of thieves were enjoying tea at the Changchun Teahouse, No. 703 Tiantong Road. He immediately led detectives Zhao Xiaohe, Yin Aliu, Huang Aqing, etc., to secretly arrest them. Unexpectedly, the</p>
<p>thieves were carrying weapons and opened fire to resist arrest when they saw the detectives arriving. Detective Chief Shang quickly dodged to avoid injury. Zhao, Yin, and Huang were all injured by bullets. Zhao was the most seriously injured and died soon after. The murderers also took the opportunity to escape. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Chief Su Changsheng and detective Zhou Meisheng of the Laoza Police Station arrested the murderers of this case in the alley at No. 46, No. 603 Kangnuot Road:</p>
<p>Zhao Yuqing from Anhui, Yin Xinren from Jiangbei, Ding Arong and Luo Xinmin from Shaoxing. A handgun and three bullets were confiscated. It turned out that Zhao and others had committed many robberies. After the police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court, the interrogation was completed. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the criminal presiding judge of the Special Court, took his seat in the First Criminal Tribunal and announced the verdict. The main text stated: "Yin Xinren is sentenced to death for the crime of repeated murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights, and sentenced to thirteen years of imprisonment for the crime of armed robbery, to be executed by death, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Zhao Yuqing and Luo Xinmin are each sentenced to thirteen years of imprisonment for the crime of repeated armed robbery, and each deprived of civil rights for fifteen years. Ding Arong is sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for the crime of repeated armed robbery. The number of days of detention before the verdict is confirmed shall be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days. The handgun and three bullets are confiscated. Zhao Yuqing and Ding Arong are found not guilty of the part of the charges relating to murder." After the sentencing, the police escorted the prisoners, including Yin, to the detention center at the gate of the court for custody, awaiting transfer to prison for execution. Unexpectedly, at this time, Yin Xinren suddenly had evil intentions and dared to gather many prisoners in custody to snatch the Hongkou Police Station No. 579 Chinese police officer's handgun in an attempt to escape. Fortunately, the police officer resisted with all his might and frantically blew the whistle, summoning other police officers to arrive and subdue Yin and others' violent acts. They were shackled and placed under strict guard, thus averting a disaster. It was indeed fortunate.</p>
<h3>Notorious Robber Questioned While Sick</h3>
<p>▲ A Bullet in the Buttocks Not Removed</p>
<p>▲ The Robber Was in So Much Pain He Couldn't Stand</p>
<p>▲ The Family Members of the Deceased Detective Also Appeared in Court</p>
<p>Chen Haitong, a notorious robber from Funing, Jiangbei, 24 years old, broke into the Tongzhou Road small vegetable market at 10:55 a.m. on the 6th of this month and robbed Wu Zihao, a native of Songjiang who was setting up a money stall, of 138.2 yuan in silver dollars. He fled to the vicinity of Hexing Lane on Wuzhou Road and shot and fatally wounded Zhu Jiantang, a detective from Tianjin working as No. 294 Chinese detective at the Laoza Police Station. Chen, the robber, was also shot in the buttocks by Chinese police and fell to the ground. Subsequently, Zhu Hanbo, the Chinese detective chief of the Jiating Road Police Station, and detective Liu Junjie arrived after hearing the alarm, and together with a handgun, they took him into the police station. The police chief ordered him to be sent by car to the Public Works Bureau Police Hospital on Huade Road for treatment. These details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now that Chen the robber's injuries have slightly improved, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that the police were accusing the defendant of robbery under Article 348 of the Criminal Law and murder under Article 350. He said that after the defendant robbed the silver dollars at the time, he fled from Dongyou Road. The stall owner, Wu Zihao, shouted for help to catch the robber and chased after him. The defendant took out a gun and fired, and Wu stopped out of fear. At this time, a Westerner named Eller was shopping at a nearby machine shop. Hearing the alarm, he went outside and tried to grab him, but the defendant pointed the gun at him to show his power and struggled to break free and flee. He ran towards Xinjibang Road, through Wanxing Lane, and towards Wuzhou Road near Hexing Lane. At this time, Zhu Jiantang, a Chinese detective from the Laoza Police Station, lived in the lane. He was holding his child and looking out at the entrance of the lane when he saw the defendant coming towards him, holding a handgun. Knowing that he was a robber, and although Detective Zhu also had a handgun with him, he didn't have time to take it out, so he bravely stepped forward to grab him. The defendant was anxious and tried to wipe out the opportunity and open fire, the sound like continuous pearls, one bullet hit his left arm, two hit his left foot. Detective Zhu endured the pain and did not let go. The third bullet struck his mouth and in extreme pain, he fell to the ground with the defendant. At this time, No. 1874 Chinese police also heard the alarm and arrived, and the defendant fired again. The Chinese police returned fire and hit him in the buttocks with two bullets, only then was he captured. The original stolen silver dollars were found in his bag. Detective Zhu was sent to the Shanghai Sanitarium Hospital, but he died of his serious injuries. The bullet that killed him hit his mouth and went out the back. Later, at the autopsy location, a bullet was removed from his arm. It was a .32 caliber bullet, which was fired by the defendant. The handguns of the Chinese police at the police station were all .38 caliber. At present, one bullet is still lodged in the defendant's buttocks and cannot be removed. A .32 caliber handgun he used at the time, and one bullet, are presented for inspection. It is also stated that all the witnesses are present in court. He requested that the case be concluded quickly. The victim, Wu Zihao, and witnesses Xu Jincheng and Zhou Meimei, testified that the defendant robbed the silver dollars and shot Detective Zhu down. Then, the Russian Eller testified that he lived at No. 275 Rue Ratard in the French Concession. At that time, he was driving his car and happened to be shopping at a machine shop near Zhoujiazui Road. He heard gunshots and went out to see someone calling for help to catch a robber. I went forward to seize him, the defendant took out a gun and threatened him to escape. I did not give up trailing him, to near Hexing Lane on Wuzhou Road, I saw the defendant and a Chinese man wrestling, he fired three shots and the Chinese man fell to the ground after being shot, while the Chinese police also had a gun "bang bang", at this time it was as fast as watching a shadow play, and so on. Zhu Wu, the wife of the deceased, testified that at the time she heard the alarm and went out, and her husband had already been shot and was lying on the ground. No. 1874 Chinese police testified about the defendant's firing situation. After being questioned, the defendant, due to the bullet remaining in his buttocks, was in too much pain to stand, and sat on the ground. He confessed that he had robbed the silver dollars and tried to escape. He fled to Hexing Lane on Wuzhou Road, when Detective Zhu grabbed me and I couldn't get away, so I fired three shots at him. The remaining supplies were hesitant. Judge Zhao Linyu appointed lawyer Jiang Baolian to provide pro bono defense. Lawyer Jiang requested that it be postponed so that the truth could be clarified, since Detective Zhu was injured three times in the case, and it was necessary to verify in detail whether the two bullets were from a .32 caliber handgun. Judge Zhao Lin approved it and ordered the defendant Chen Haitong to be remanded in custody, to be reviewed next Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Public Security Bureau Sends Workers to Excavate Unexploded Shells in Wusong</h3>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, the Japanese warships fiercely attacked Wusong, so the unexploded artillery shells left in the area of Paotaiwan and Wusong Town were more numerous than in other places.

Numerous tragedies have already occurred. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, in light of this, yesterday sent technician Wang to lead workers to Song, to the Seventh District of Public Security, where Chief Li dispatched police to the Taixing Bridge, Wusong Middle School and other places where unexploded shells have been discovered, to carry out excavation in advance, in order to prevent future troubles.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Public Works Bureau to Stop Telephone Company from Cutting Lines</h3>
<p>▲ The Interests of the Majority of Citizens Should Be Considered</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, on the 19th of this month, we received letters from the First Sub-District Association of Shanghai Citizens and the Nanjing Road Business Community Association, stating that the Shanghai Telephone Company is using oppressive means to cut off telephone lines and requesting assistance in striving for their rights. On the same day, we also received a letter from Taichang Xieji Car Company on Rue Edouard, stating that as far as they know, there are still many users on Rue Edouard who have not paid according to the new regulations. However, the company suddenly cut off their lines on the 13th of this month, causing intangible losses, and they are arbitrarily selecting one or two companies to use line cutting as a tool of intimidation, requesting assistance in striving for their rights. The Telephone Users' Association is still negotiating with the company, and the company is suddenly cutting off the lines of users. Our association believes that this situation is actually oppression disguised as self-defense. The current dispute is over the difference between the new regulations and the old prices. Since this level has already been negotiated, there should be a satisfactory solution. Even if the negotiations ultimately fail, the company has adequate procedures to recover the difference and should not incur any losses. Based on the previous information, there is deep concern that this will damage the interests of the majority of shops and cause disputes. Your bureau should not disregard the feelings of the majority of citizens in order to protect the interests of private companies. We are sending this letter for discussion, and we urge your bureau to stop the company's line cutting action. This is our earnest request."</p>
