<p>一未來戰爭如何</p>
<p>世界局勢日漸緊張太平洋風雲尤爲迫切當此一張一弛若隠若現之國際變態中各國當局苟眞誠爲其國家民族謀福利者皆不能不步步留心謹愼將事而爲國家主人翁之國民莫不惴惴不安恐怖之時多而安慰之時少也際此危迫時期具戰爭先機者其爲德法戰爭乎反蘇聯戰爭乎抑日美戰爭乎</p>
<p>法德戰爭在已往之歷史過程據當前之客觀形勢與夫法德兩國間之民族情感皆有爆發大戰之可能性不過德意志自一九二零年而後大戰創痍尙未平服縱令國家思想抬頭帝國主義欲望再興軍備平等要求即能達到其國民經濟能力亦萬不許其積極挑戰故德法間之戰爭危機雖急而實緩反蘇聯戰爭在資本主義各國僅有經濟封鎖之起意具限制蘇聯之意識尙未見有實際備戰之企圖而蘇聯方面雖高唱「人不侵我我不犯人」之和平其第一五年計劃之主旨與第二五年計劃之指針主要目的在於重工業之建設其爲軍事的整備乃世所共知恐「赤」之病遍世流行然而十一月二十九日法蘇互不侵犯條約簽字而後西歐國際形勢陡然一變雖法蘇對立未必立見消滅而一般情形乃頓見良好反蘇聯戰爭在短時間内决無爆發之可能况日蘇之間亦各圖避免戰爭乎</p>
<p>二日美皆積極備戰</p>
<p>捨以上二者而外足以招致世界戰爭之危機者其爲日美戰爭耶</p>
<p>日美戰爭近來已成爲一種極普遍之流行語觀夫日美兩國之報章雜誌與出版物消行最廣者厥爲戰爭描寫尤以描寫日美戰爭爲甚且日本之爲東方德意志亦非美國所給與之别名其爲好戰的軍國主義者其欲獨霸東亞其欲强占遠東市塲自瀋陽事變以還已昭然若揭無可諱飾其明年度預算軍事費已超過八億二千萬日金荒不陸相且以爲年費十億廿億亦所不惜就美國方面觀之豈特東方市塲有被侵之虞菲利濱至於關島皆將淪於敵人之手即夏威夷亦恐不免乎敵艦之包圍而利福尼亞州恐尙不能免飛機之襲擊也</p>
<p>以目前情形觀之日美兩方皆正提倡積極的軍國主義彼兩國之間各懷嫉視妨害憤恨而張大惡意宣傳競爲龐大的軍備而軍事密探亦遍各地危機四伏戰爭縱未必一觸即發其正在佈置火線則殊無疑義矣經濟恐慌旣未消失所謂轉機亦僅見端序將來之補益須賴東方市場美國所持之「門户開放機會均等」主義意在開關市塲使過剩商品有消售餘地乃日本者竟欲實行封鎖貫徹其獨占主義當此時也解决之道僅有兩途一則日本屈服於九國公約之下撤去侵滿之兵恢復平常狀態一則爲積極備戰實行武力侵略决不顧任何國際關係祇圖一國之利吾人固審知欲日本尊重九國公約踐行門户開放者實等於「海中撈月」「緣木求魚」也捨準備戰爭而外恐無他途耳</p>
<p>三太平洋海軍新重向</p>
<p>溯自今年春季大西洋艦隊至太平洋上會操照舊習於會操完畢之後即應歸還原隊而乃滯留太平洋其歸隊至少將延至明年春操之後本年十一月三十日美國陸軍方面亦鑑於當前形勢嚴重雖在經濟恐慌困苦之中亦提議陸軍常備將校將由一萬二千二百四十一人增加至一萬四千人兵員將由十二萬八千七百人增加至十六萬四千人其軍用器械亦將煥然一新其所增加數目誠極細徵實行時期亦未確定然此種準備固不待乎軍事專門家始得而預知其帶有危險性也至於海軍就目前軍實論之表面上固爲十十七英美日三國之比率但實質上美國艦隊　多腐舊其下水年代多在一九一四年以前驅逐艦輕巡洋艦及潛水艦艇更加陳舊再過四年之後美國驅逐艦之隻數雖仍較日本多一倍有奇而有效噸數恐將不及日本二分之一輕巡洋艦隻數美國較之日本原少十三而有效噸數竟高一倍以上潛水艦艇論數量美幾倍於日本然老朽者多新鋭者少有效噸數僅及日本四分之三設美國此時不增築艦艇實行補助者則一九三六年之後恐更無海上作戰能力矣矧越渡太平洋五千餘海里之距離又豈老大之艦隊所能勝任耶是故軍備縮小在分之一之提議如爲日本所拒絕（日閥已表示决然拒絕此種提議力主潛水艦艇及驅逐艦維持現狀）且有增加之意北美合衆國新總統羅斯福氏對「門户開放」維持「機會均等」之主張并未放鬆則海軍方面要求建築倫敦會議所許之新艦勢將提早趕造一九三三年以後之太平洋春季會操將愈見有聲有色而軍備縮小聲中又將重見軍備競爭之開始矣</p>

<p>蘇日兩國的關係時而晴快時而陰鬰時而由接近而親善時而提兵調將如臨大敵記者雖然也住在寒荒的赤區裏到底看不清他們倆的眞意是要眉尾相結的拼一下子呢（？）是成立蘇日互不侵犯條約緩和現時緊張的局面（？）</p>
<p>照理講日本是帝國雖掛着立憲的招牌其實際是軍人專政特别是近一年以來軍部氣燄萬丈對東三省出兵非但鐡蹄踢碎了中國在東北的政權踏毁了中國的三千萬的人民蹂躪蘇聯在北滿的權利　中東路而且日本軍部還把他的議會政治都一鐡拳打碎蘇聯呢人人都知他是個獨裁的國家是共産黨獨裁的國家不過他是走向社會主義之路的國家雖然目前未必就能完全實現他們的理想可是他豫想的未來他現在的行動都和别國不同特别是與日本眞是冰炭不相容的不過蘇聯國中對日本的看法也有兩種不同的主張一種是現任陸海軍人民委員長窝羅錫洛夫氏主張審愼先充實自已的實力而遠東軍司令官布豈岳雷（即前曾任國民革命軍問顧的加倫將軍）則以爲日本如果逼人太甚即當毫不容忍的應戰</p>
<p>日本旣占領了滿洲豈止和滿洲締結了軍事同盟而且與滿洲打成一片把滿洲化作日本的前衛日本與滿洲成了同一個軍事單位同時經濟上他更想作成所謂日滿經濟聯盟在對外的意義上無論是軍事方面是經濟方面都含得有敵對蘇聯的深意固然在另一方面是對美作戰的根據但是在滿洲有個日本所最不放心并且也最難堪的是一把長劍揷入北滿腹地中東鐡路這條鐡路從滿洲里直貫黑吉兩省照現時的情况不僅與滿洲有緊密關係與日本在滿的利權上至少是個極大的癌腫足使滿洲的傀儡不得安穏足使日本帝國主義的大陸政策根本動搖所以日本一方面運用外交手腕向英法暗示日本是東方站在防俄第一線的先鋒日本略取「滿洲」是爲所謂和平可是同時他又知道國際聯盟是英法兩國的工具如今德國不馴意大利聯德法國在歐洲的霸權勢將根本動搖所以法國不能不設法維持國聯的顔面於是對日本就不得不加以一種制限</p>
<p>日本爲了保持他侵略所得爲了抵禦列强之染指於「滿洲」遂不能不暫時曲意拉攏蘇聯借蘇聯作他的外交工具</p>
<p>蘇聯本身很知道他的工業比資本主義的幾個强國都更落後要在資本主義的環境中造成社會主義的國家須經過相當大的辛苦經營所以新經濟政策實施以至五年計劃第二五年計劃都着力於自已的基本工作　　械化和電氣</p>

<p>政治上在現時這種緊張的時期日本用什麽方法呢松岡洋右赴日内瓦之便道經西比利亞在莫斯科下車小作勾留</p>
<p>第一個先去拜會外務次長加拉罕接着又去見外交人民委員長李特維洛夫又去拜訪莫洛托夫以至於共黨的權威者斯塔林他都去拜候過并且爲了表示親切起見竟不惜參加「帝國」所最忌諱最怕的（十一月七日）赤色紀念大會松岡和蘇聯一般當權者會晤其談話内容大約可分爲以下幾點</p>
<p>一蘇日互不侵犯條約須有交換條件松岡在赤色雰圍中不敢過於露骨説是要北海漁業要西比利亞森林礦産只得述説日本親善之意和日蘇兩國間應該互相諒解共同維持「滿洲」的現勢</p>
<p>二探聽蘇聯是否願意立即承認日本所建立的「滿洲（傀儡）國」</p>
<p>三關於中東路日本雖設計剪斷他究竟是日本的腹心之疾松岡本意是在試探蘇聯可否出售中東路於日并表示日本願意出相當大的代價</p>
<p>蘇聯負責當局的答覆非常有趣説是『自中日衝突事件發生以來蘇聯依舊保持和平的素願嚴守中立······對於其他的問題（互不侵犯條約可以商量以外都不曾準備考慮······』</p>

<p>華東社云全國各界救國團體聯合會於昨日（四日）下午邀請東北抗日各軍聯合駐滬通訊處主任丁超李杜代表劉丕光君蒞會報告最近東北義勇軍作戰狀况計到該會理事張軍光·屠亮·董墨生·左華·謝乃實·陳振權·馬志英等二時三十分開會由主席張軍光致詞後劉君即開始報告云今天兄弟承諸位邀請到會報告覺得非常歡迎本來應該很詳細的與諸位談談可是這幾天有病只好無次序的簡單報告一些關於吉黑的近况抱歉得很</p>
<p>▲關於黑龍江方面</p>
<p>黑龍江方面抗日作戰以往的情形各位大都知之極詳現在只從最近情况説最近黑龍江在軍事上西北部完全爲蘇炳文部隊所佔有東北部爲馬占山部所佔有蘇炳文的反正事前曾經詳細的計劃與準備所以舉事以後力量非常强大因之日人也集中全力來壓迫蘇軍但是蘇軍並不屈服他自與馬占山部隊合併後反抗的力量更大現在蘇馬的實力總計約十萬左右集中在興安嶺的就有五六萬人興安嶺之西完全爲蘇的勢力東南是馬的勢力日軍的勢力只在齊齊哈爾·海倫·和哈爾濱·一帶鐡路沿線最近因爲黑軍集中在興安嶺所以日軍也向那裏集中所以將來雙方的大戰在興安嶺勝負也在興安嶺</p>
<p>▲關於吉林省方面</p>
<p>吉林方面在牡丹江一帶和松花江以東俄屬東海濱省以西完全在丁李的勢力範圍之下在那　軍事最近並無大戰只在十多天以前松花江下游的依蘭線完全爲李杜所奪回所以松花江一帶失地已能恢復現在的作戰計劃擬從依蘭哈爾濱擾亂日軍後方日軍已有了這種恐慌所以也集重兵於哈爾濱至於王德林方面完全與丁李合作王德林部自破壞吉會線之修成後可以説在戰略上的一個大成功使日軍無法完成其在軍事上的循環綫現在王的實力約五萬丁李的實力約八萬</p>
<p>▲吉黑義軍的近况</p>
<p>吉林與黑龍江兩省約有二十餘縣地方並没有被人奪去在那裏中華民國的郵政照常可通靑天白日旗也到處飛揚數千里美滿山河只剩這一點乾凈地實在非常痛心現在吉黑軍隊在給養與軍需上極感困難去年比較的可以支配今年却困難得簡直無法可想了因爲一年以來軍隊加多所需自然也要增加今年春夏没有夾衣和單衣兵士們只好把棉衣裏的棉花敗絮拆去現在冬季已到再没有棉花敗絮裹到身上去雖然有些部份向民間索取棉被以製棉衣然而棉被有限那　夠使兵士禦寒所以現在大部份兵士身上還穿着單衣或夾衣在冰天雪地裏與敵拼命糧食大都自民間拿來不幸今年松花江一帶水災秋收無望於是糧食也非常恐慌了至於槍械子彈的缺乏更是十分顯著的現象</p>
<p>▲義軍作戰的策略</p>
<p>日本軍隊對於義軍的壓迫完全用列陣來作戰但這並不要緊義軍方面可以用游擊的方式去對付他使他無法應付而且義軍的射擊非常準確一顆子彈終能打倒一個敵人但是日軍的大砲飛機與炸彈却是使義軍無法對付的因爲義軍方面並没有這種精良的槍械所以日人只會在日間以砲火炸彈來轟炸義軍只能在晚上偷襲目前日人的勢力完全憑藉於沿南滿·北寗·洮昂·中東·等鐡路沿綫重要城市此外便没有他們的蹝跡至於義軍方面便到處出没游擊使日軍難以應付雖然以義軍的力量也能奪回重要城市可是奪回以後因無槍械彈藥實難保守爲避免重大的損失只好暫時不奪倘然國家政府能予以切實的援助那麽奪還東省並不困難</p>
<p>▲日本侵略之失敗</p>
<p>日帝國主義的强佔吾國東省原想以東三省的經濟侵略來救濟他自身的危機但是一年以來東三省雖爲日人所佔領成立了傀儡政府然因義軍的反抗擾亂使東三省地方完全陷於混亂之中商業凋敝經濟破産日人在東北的經濟侵略並不能圓滿成功所以義軍能堅持到底與日作戰日帝國主義經濟侵略之失敗自不待言同時日本的移民政策也完全失敗雖然自九一八以後他們曾努力進行其所謂武裝移民然而這些移民隨時隨地受着義軍的壓迫現在過去的移民都因經濟之破産而先後逃亡或自殺新的移民當然更難立足所以自九一八以後日本的移民政策也完全失敗了</p>
<p>▲東北日軍之暴行</p>
<p>日軍對於我國人民隨意殘殺去年九一八以後從嫩江橋作戰回來的前方將士大家都親眼看見日人把中國人一個個捉來倒弔在橋上慢慢的用刀剌死至於各地方中國人被活埋的更是司空見慣活埋的方法便是要被埋的人自已挖泥洞自已攢到洞裏去自已用手把泥蓋起來最後才由日人用泥把那個人完全埋好有時候他們也隨便的捉着一個中國人指爲嫌疑而以皮鞭痛打甚至把火油辣椒水漢入鼻孔和嘴裏在重要的城市裏過幾天就有一次衛生檢查或户口調查調查的時候日人就隨便闖入民家任意的毆打男人奸淫婦女尤其那些女學生被侮辱得無法形容日帝國主義鐡蹄下的國人痛苦得已與亡國奴無異了</p>
<p>▲國人應有的努力</p>
<p>東北三省的失陷原是件非常痛心的事現在義勇軍之與日作戰雖然力量不大但所予以日本的打擊已經　常深巨可知欲雪國恥只有武力然而義勇軍的力量非常薄弱非有全國同胞之援助很難勝利所以當此國家危急之秋凡屬國人都應該各盡力量來援助義軍不論在精神上和物質上只有這樣　不斷的努力才能置敵於死地洗雪國　收復失地至於各界的捐欵援助最好直接匯到　邊不但那邊的電匯尚通而且免去許多麻煩關於這點也是兄弟今天特别提出來向諸位聲明的報告着許久要説的話雖然很多但因時間的關係和病的關係只得在此結束劉君報告畢欵以水菓即告散會</p>

<p>│參看廿一，十二，一張秋雲女士信│</p>
<p>我認爲夫婦的愛情，大半是建築在「靈」│志趣品學上的，換句話説：就是夫婦的結合須以「靈」的優美爲第一條件：假使雙方志趣背道而馳，品學不能相等，那任你是郎才女貌·愛情也不能永久維持下云的·</p>
<p>現在社會造成了雲秋女士所謂：「新婚夫婦的愛情由濃得化不開降而爲化得開，更降而至∶∶∶悲劇」的現象，就是因爲一般人擇偶只在「肉」｜｜色貌上追求，而忽略，甚至完全放棄了「靈」的追求·</p>
<p>「肉」是具有夫婦間愛情一部份的勢力，這我也不能加以否認；尤其是在新婚蜜月期間，夫婦的愛情幾乎完全以「肉」爲出發點；假使夫婦倆愛情能永恒像度蜜月時那般濃厚甜蜜，固然是人人所願意；不過事實告訴我：這是萬萬不可能的：要夫婦倆白頭偕老·要愛情不致由沸點而降至冰點，演出那破裂悲劇，那只有在戀愛的過程中注重於「靈」；明顯些説：就是須以對方的品學優美·志趣與已相符爲訂婚第一問題·</p>
<p>秋雲女士與對方的愛情，是否完全建築於「肉」上？與對方的志趣相合否？及對方的品學怎様？我是不得而知；當然，不明白人家是不配替人解答的：不過，我有兩點貢獻，這貢獻·也許足以爲女士自决的參考吧？</p>
<p>㈠倘使對方的志趣與已合得來，品學也不差；僅僅是愛情不如新婚蜜月時那般濃厚甜蜜，而側重於義務方面，那可以説是當然的，不成問題；理由就是：有權利則有義務，有樂則有苦，　以苦樂循環即是「人生」月有晦明，花有開落；大自然給我們的暗示正多呢｜</p>
<p>㈡倘使對方的志趣與已背道而馳，品學又惡劣，那只有出於離婚的一途；否則，徒然增加痛苦而已·</p>

<p>頃見貴報讀者顧問欄劉學君來信問安徽同鄉會控告振災委員會查勉仲等一事，第二點：「假使所控非實，對於誣告應如何處罰」？第三點：「假定所控是實，則對於查勉仲等應如何處罰？」其後附貴報記者意見，請大家參加討論。鄙意此案旣已訴諸法律，應該依法解决，現此案正在法律程序進行之中，爲尊重法律起見，無論原告被告及第三者，均當靜待法庭依法審判，凡處於第三者地位之人，應該注意兩點：</p>
<p>㈠報紙記載該案依法審判情形之經過及雙方口供，各報是否一律以客觀態度記錄刊載？</p>
<p>㈡法庭是否能爲公平合法之判决？及法官對於此案之態度是否公正無私？</p>

<p>我是一個商人，現在某校任敎員，每月薪金約百五十元左右，但開支却極爲浩繁·家用每月非七八十元不夠，最苦是三個兒子求學，大兒子在本埠某大學二年級，每半年學膳宿諸費約二百元左右，第二個是女兒，在本埠某中學三年級，一學期也得費一百五六十元，第三個兒子還只十歲，在小學讀書，每半年也要花百餘元，還有第四個今年已經五歲，也急待入學。每學期這一筆浩大的學費·眞逼得我如像熱鍋上的螞蟻一様，無法可想。我想令大兒子輟學另外找點事情做，但他只差兩年畢業，不忍令其工虧一簀；想令女兒輟學，一提起她便哭·甚至絶食；至於第三個還是在小學，更没有令其輟學的道理。然而這也不行，那也不行，我却實在負擔不起了，一步也走不動了｜我自已服務敎育界十多年，平常總是勸人讀書，但敎了人家的子弟，自已的子弟却天天感受着失學的威脅，這不僅令我對自已的職業懷疑，而且深感做一個負責的父兄之不易。記得云年本埠曾有一個裁縫因爲無力送子女上學而羞憤自殺，以一死謝子女，我現在也時時興起這様的念頭。然而，我想，在這社會，處境如像我這樣的，眞不知有多多少少，這眞是一個極嚴重的社會問題，先生，這問題究應如何解决？請提交大家討論罷｜</p>

<p>３０</p>
<p>附註</p>
<p>一筆算第一二學年的一到十一各項在第一學年敎學，不用算式，只須隨機給以算術的知識，所以時間每週只定六十分。十二以下在第二學年敎學，第三四學年的一到十六各項，可列在第三學年，十七以下可列在第四學年；第五六學年的一到十六各項可列第五學年，餘可列入第六學年。珠算從第四學年開始。</p>
<p>二在　村裏或偏僻的地方，一二學年的兒童年齡較長，没有入學以前，已經有了不少的數量經騐和常識，以及計算的習慣，所以宜把一二年各項和三四年一到一五各項的作業，當行分配，大約分作二年學完。</p>
<p>三外國度量衡及外國貨幣，各地方倘有需要，可酌量增加，例如靑島南滿等處，可加中日制的比較·餘類推。内地不需要者，可　不用。</p>
<p>第四·敎學方法要點</p>
<p>㈠第一學年的算術應隨機敎學而不特定正式時間或和别的設計聯絡敎學第二學年或如第一學年或特定正式時間敎學由各校各依自已的方便而施行</p>
<p>㈡第三四學年以下的算術應充分和别的設計聯絡敎學在每節的敎學時間内三四年應抽出五分鐘到十分鐘五六年應抽出十分鐘單獨練習計算技能四年級起並且應當使用「算術練習測騐」</p>
<p>㈢取材第一二學年以日常食·衣·用品等問題爲範圍第三四學年以食·衣·住·行·和學校作業家庭經濟等問題爲範圍第五六學年以食·衣·住·行·學校·家庭·社會·國際等經濟問題爲範圍特别注重賣買找錢折扣等的練習但須就本地情形兒童興趣而隨時活用</p>
<p>㈣第一二學年的作業必須寄託於游戲利用競爭比賽或開店演習等的方法而敎學第三學年以後也須時常應用此種方法以使兒童因興趣而努力</p>
<p>㈤問題要具體而有興趣低年級應充分用表演的方法把問題演成事實讓兒童直觀至三四年級也應使問題故事化帮𦔳兒童想像事實㈥用文字寫示問題要力求淸楚淺顯内容事實不可曲折多而使兒童不易領會</p>
<p>㈦新的方法原理應從實在的需要出發先使兒童明白方法的功用用歸納法一步一步的進行切忌用演釋法堆求</p>
<p>㈧解决問題的計算法不必多用論理的分析而須訴諸兒童的經騐和常識</p>
<p>㈨心算是算術的基礎尤須練習得十分純熟㈩日常生活所用的短數（就是十以内的數目）的算法尤應注意練習</p>
<p>（十一）筆算珠算都是帮𦔳心算的工具各校當然可以兼敎珠算因有一進的關係比十進的筆算較爲難學敎學時應與筆算充分聯絡並注意於手指的熟習</p>
<p>（十二）速算等習慣的養成是由漸而來不可一蹴卽幾的所以應該細細的劃定了步驟按步就班的應用練習的方法以求由生疏而漸進於純熟</p>
<p>（十三）練習的方法應多方變化並應利用兒童的成功的興趣使自努力</p>
<p>（十四）槪算騐算等應從低年級最初敎學時起便時時注意</p>
<p>（十五）五六年級宜注重日常生活需要的四則應用問題的練習惟以淺易者爲原則</p>

<h3 id="c163">東北運現問題 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>近三個月來由上海運往東北現洋據聞有一千八九百萬元一般與論均不悉眞因以爲無異代彼方搜集現金購收東北特産大豆運銷美國以扶持日本對外匯兑價格議論紛紜甚囂塵上現經詳實調查始知另有特殊理由蓋爲供給東北　民之需要遂因这連帶發生存匯抵補之關係惟在上海方面雖屬出口而此項運到之現欵仍散於東北農民之手一轉移間仍由旅東農民悉數携回關内曾居東北者類知其槪是以目前運現一事楚弓楚得尚不成問題而實際上東北同胞經濟力之周轉如何能脱去外人之覊絆國人誠應亟加注意者也茲更據探查所得分誌於後以供留心東北金融者之參考一·東北三省國人號稱三千萬其中務農者約佔七成此二千一百萬之農民非悉土著小半數均爲直魯豫三省客籍之民每年春往冬回一屆冬令卽以其收穫所得輾轉易爲現洋分别匯回或携帶回籍（因東北紙幣　不能通用於關内也）假定每人携回一二十元以至數十元不等如是每屆冬令卽陡增匯欵之交易或現洋之需要達數千萬元之巨</p>
<p>二·此等客籍農民多數散居關内内地無銀行之地因郵局設置之普遍向來年終回籍前多數交由郵局匯入關内此等郵局銀行匯欵總額每年不下數千萬元近因國郵撤回又不能盡由銀行通匯對於滿洲中央銀行紙幣又不信用復因東北紙幣不能流通關内不能將其帶回使用只得悉數兑換現洋隨身携帶况東北人心不定卽已經落户客民亦多以其所備之紙幣調換現洋以求安全此所以東北近來有巨額現洋之需要</p>
<p>三·九一八以後中國人在東北所經營之銀錢行莊尚照舊營業以保持原有經濟上地位其在南部之大連營口等處亦與往日一樣並無變更且因北滿水災及各處地方不靖人心不安商業蕭條一般社會心存愛國存欵仍放入本國銀錢行莊所以自九一八以來東北方面中國人所設之銀錢行莊其存欵均有向來未有之巨額增加而各行莊因當此東北時局自然無法運用其存欵於東北復不敢儲存東北各種紙幣遂將其所吸收之存欵調往滬津等處以謀存户之安全及冬令直魯豫各省客民回籍之時需要匯欵或現洋此等銀錢行莊卽不能不負調劑之責試觀東北對申津匯水之陡漲而特漲卽可察知其大槪自有此大宗現洋之需要不得不運現以供應之但此等現洋終仍爲客籍農民帶回關内原籍故實際上亦不致留在東北也</p>
<p>四·東北市塲向來均以各種不兑換紙幣相交易無須現洋近來僞國統一幣制日人施展經濟上之壟斷以滿洲中央銀行紙幣換回從前各種不兑換紙幣幾以滿洲中央銀行紙幣爲交易之法定貨幣日人欲收買大荳只須以金票換取滿洲中央銀行紙幣或正鈔（正金銀行紙幣）或尚未收回之以前各種紙幣卽可交易並無賴乎現洋而國人所設之銀錢行莊掙扎於惡劣環境之中則不能不爲提存兑現之準備也</p>
<p>由此觀之日人在東北實施壟斷經濟之政策日甚一日我國農民終歲辛勤所得僅此血汗易來之紙幣工資旣不能携回原籍使用自不得不交銀錢行莊滙回如其原籍地方爲銀錢行莊所不能通滙而又無郵局可匯則祇有換成現洋帶回之一法若使東北方面我國銀錢行莊不運現洋接濟以供其需要不亦將坐視此數百萬之　民流落東北淪爲餓莩而後已乎然在日本人方面固深願此數百萬同胞有欵無法滙回轉而收藏滿洲中央銀行紙幣以慶其計之得售也</p>
<h3 id="c164">蘇俄銀行制度　吳鴻綬譯 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>TheSovietBankingSystem</p>
<p>蘇俄國家銀行StateBank最近已完成其十年成功之經營蘇俄國家銀行爲全國唯一之發行銀行及中央信用機關故對於國家經濟之提高實爲一主要原素此外國家銀行對於産生穏定幣制工商業之發展及實踐社會建設之經濟政策等均有特殊重要之任務</p>
<p>一九二一年時國家銀行之組成及一九二二年時盧布金票Gold|backedbanknotes(Chervontzi)之特准發行權均係實行建設穏定幣制及集中資本之初步最初資本之集成不包括跌價之紙幣而於一九三二年五月一日國家銀行集成一注準備金包括金白金及固定外國幣價値七二二·八（百萬單位）盧布（合美金三萬七千餘萬元）在同一日期上銀行之資本及盈餘共計五七六三○○○○○盧布（合美金二萬九千六百餘萬元）較之一九二四年十月一日增加六倍國家銀行之資産增加頗速自一九二二年十月一日之一萬五千五百萬盧布至一九三二年五月一日增加至一八千兆盧布（合美金九·四千兆）本年度每月平均之流通數額已達五五千兆盧布以視一九二二年至三年之一萬萬盧布相去甚遠分行散佈全國現在已有二千七百餘機關成立矣</p>
<p>▲蘇俄銀行對於經濟政策之任務▲</p>
<p>蘇聯無私立銀行所有私立銀行均於一九｜七年十二月收歸國營於是此項銀行成爲政策中不可少之份子　共同進行以達其共有之目的卽扶𦔳實行經濟政策是也此項銀行對於集中及再分配國家進益一項有重要任務蘇俄銀行之主要當事人爲國民經濟中之各項組織及事業</p>
<p>蘇俄銀行制度中唯一之特點卽短期放欵與長期放欵經營之劃分此項辦法已逐漸實行矣自初創時起短期放欵大部集中於國家銀行直至一九三○年之改革後國家銀行始成爲短期放欵之惟一來源國家銀行並亦經營某種長期放欵尤以農業爲最至一九三二年五月所有長期放欵始分配於四處指定銀行中</p>
<p>▲國家銀行之發展▲</p>
<p>過去十年中國家銀行之發展乃國民經濟發達之反應當國家銀行初創時其時適爲採用新經濟政策之後國内經濟程度因受世界及國内戰爭之結果降落極低工業生産祇達戰前百分之二十農産不滿百分之五十而運輪事業幾至完全破産此新創立之國家銀行乃起任復興工業農業及國内商業組織之要務在此時期中國家銀行之主要工作除創立穏定幣制及信用制度外乃培植社會化工商業之發展</p>
<p>國家銀行由於來源之激增乃能擴充其放欵經營以適合發展極快之農工商業所需要之經營資本國家銀行對於各種國民經濟所推行之放欵自一九二四年十月一日之五二五（百萬）盧布增加至二·九千兆盧布（一九二八年十月一日）又進至五·四千兆盧布（一九三二年五月一日）此數分配於各主要事業如下</p>
<p>（百萬盧布）　（百分數）</p>
<p>國内供應及國營事業　一五一九·四　二八·一</p>
<p>農業　　　　　　　　七○八·二　　一三·一</p>
<p>重工業　　　　　　　六七四·一　　一二·五</p>
<p>消費合作業　　　　　六五九·○　　一二·二</p>
<p>木業　　　　　　　　五七·一九　　一○·六</p>
<p>輕工業　　　　　　　五五四·一　　一○·三</p>
<p>生産合作業　　　　　一一四·六　　二·一</p>
<p>國家銀行並亦管理蘇聯大宗國外貿易所有蘇俄之國外貿易收支各項均歸國家銀行辦理付出之欵由世界各地支行照付蘇俄之集中及有計劃之管理國外付欵甚爲可靠蓋自蘇聯與國外貿易發生關係之時期内從未有一次不可靠之付欵也</p>
<p>蘇俄國家銀行由議事會及董事會二部管轄之蘇俄財政部長卽議事會主席該會每年至少開會二次規定營業大綱及委派董事董事會之董事長及副董事長由民政部長委派之</p>
<p>工商業生産穏快之發展及所有大宗生産及商業均逐漸集中於社會化之手致使國家銀行及蘇俄幣制得增加其金融上之穏固地位由於各種新發展信用制度乃不得不有一度之改革蓋信用制度在一九三○年以前乃以匯票爲主也</p>
<p>▲信用制度之改革▲</p>
<p>一九三○年一月之信用改革規定廢除一切舊式之商業信用而以直接之銀行信用代之國内及合作事業因此不准再以信用互相供給貨品或服務於是國家銀行成爲唯一之短期放欵機關此項放欵係供給購貨者非如票據貼現式之供給賣主也</p>
<p>嗣後因信用改革規定中發現某項弱點及曲解之處故又於一九三一年（一月三月六月）頒布補充之法令此項法令之執行果能除去以前交易時之機械狀態注重買主及賣主間契約之重要確定國家銀行之任務担保銀行信用之主要條件使放欵之准許根據經濟或生産計劃及按時還欵之實行此項法令對於穏固經濟會計加緊商業週始增加經濟組織對於合理化生産之興趣減少成本積蓄盈餘及改良信用紀律等各點在已往時期中均有良好之證明</p>
<p>▲長期信用銀行▲</p>
<p>國家銀行在蘇俄銀行制度上佔有卓越地位又爲唯一之發生及短期信用機關但此外之長期信用銀行同時亦負起一最重要之功用卽調劑建設資本是也</p>
<p>建設資本之撥用年來頻有增加本年度之總數爲二四·二千兆盧布在此項情形之下最重要者厥爲對於每一設計應督促其絶對負責在其規定時期内計劃之實行及使其減少成本爲欲對於調劑建设資金制度（根據設計之確實履行而給予借欵）作更精密之管理及擴充建築工程之經濟會計起見爰復於一九三二年五月五日公佈法令改組長期信用之組織該法令集中所有長期信用經營於四種銀行每一種銀行担任調劑國家經纃中固定之建設資本</p>
<p>第一種銀行爲工業銀行Proinbank注重調劑國營國内外事業之屬於管理重工業輕工業木業供應業及國外貿易業之　重部者及屬於勞資仲裁委員會者第二種爲農業銀行Selkhozbank專事調劑所有國家農場搬運業及聯合農場等之投資本第三種爲合作銀行Yeskcbank專事調劑所有合作組織｜｜除家庭合作社外｜之建設資金第四種爲市政銀行Tsekombank專事調劑市政公用事業宿舍之建造及新城市之設置除合作銀行外所有其他三種銀行均以不歸還之補𦔳金及長期放欵流通之合作銀行祇有長期放欵</p>
<p>工業及電氣業之大宗建設資金均爲不償還放欵此項放欵之大部由政府財庫供給之但所有工業組織均須將其盈餘之一部分付入銀行因此當許多工廠及電廠創辦後各廠交人之盈餘部分亦因之增加而財庫預算上之放欵卽形减少</p>
<p>本年初季經營長期放欵之工商銀行已設立三十二處分行並在國家銀行多數分行中派有代表爲欲與實際之建設計劃有相當接觸起見各分行均就大多數建築進行之區域而設立由於直接管理及銀行機關對於工程供給機關之嚴密計核結果對於經濟有相當鼓勵</p>
<p>除國家銀行及長期放欵銀行調劑國民經濟外更有儲蓄銀行散佈全國本年初委其存欵總數已超過一千兆盧布以上</p>
<p>蘇俄經濟發展之穏固經營及其完美之放欵制度｜此項制度爲全部經濟計劃中最主要之原素｜｜使蘇俄銀行制度位於穏固地位並已能避免週轉不靈之處蘇俄銀行制度及幣制得以穏固之叧一原因厥爲政府每年預算之平衡而絶無短少也</p>
<p>蘇俄之財政預算以適合經濟需要爲主故一九三二年全支出二○·四千兆盧布中一五·三千兆或百分之七十五用於調劑國民經濟（工·農·運輪·商·郵及電報等各業）祇一·五千兆盧布或百分之七·五用於國家防禦及管理</p>
<p>蘇俄財政預算之大宗税收來源爲社會化之國民經濟餘外祇一小部分由人民納税社會化部分所繳入者凡二宗：國營事業盈餘之一部分及營業週始税BusinessTurnoverTax是也税率之變更對於物價　涉蓋物價須經政府限制故營業週始税並非取諸人民一九三一年由社會化部分所收入税額爲一五·九千兆盧布卽全税收百分之七七·六由人民所收之税額則爲二·九千兆盧布僅百分之十四耳</p>
<p>政府之金融制度雖已有較穏之基礎但因蘇俄工業之突飛猛進並不減少銀行以後之重任就事實而論國家經濟財源之增加銀行對於撥發此項財源而再分配之使國家之發展及人民之幸福更進一步則尤爲蘇俄銀行更大之要務也</p>

<p>王宗培</p>
<p>現代商業日趨於國際化各種主要商品行市多半隨同國際市塲爲轉移上海旣爲我國商業重要市塲亦爲世界大商埠之一故國内外各業市價互有關係惟以度量衡之不同貨幣單位之互異各以國别以致價格有折合換算之舉而此種換算局外人頗難了解此篇之作係業外人就調查所得草擬算法務求本業專家加以指正本刊對於此種商榷研究稿件極表歡迎尚望源源而來嘉惠讀者幸甚幸甚編者謹誌最近十餘年我國各地迭受天災人禍民不聊生農村經濟潰崩農民相率離鄉田地荒蕪生産减縮産量頗豐且曾遠銷海外之小麥輸出亦年减一年而洋麥之輸入反與年俱增輓近各麵粉工場其原料之供給亦惟洋麥是賴良以洋麥品質優於國産小麥製粉可得較佳之紀錄故爲各麵粉廠所樂用造成喧賓奪主之現象</p>
<p>洋麥在今日之中國市場已居一重要地位其輪入品種以澳麥坎麥美麥爲大宗是故各該地收穫之豐歉市價之漲落皆足以影響上海这麥市而華洋麥價之換算方法遂成爲廠商及投機家研究興趣之中心點矣</p>
<p>華洋麥價之不同在乎呌價單位與夫本位幣之互異上海雜糧油餅交易所之標凖小麥每石必須重一百三十九斤至一百四十斤方爲合格買賣以「車」爲單位每車約八百八十斤市價則按「担」｜一百斤｜計算例如最近行市每担約値規元三兩四錢是至國外麥市以北美洲爲中心坎拿大方面之市價據業中人云卽以澳麥爲賣標準而美國小麥則集中於芝加哥一地其市價計算以「蒲式耳」（Bushel）爲單位以美金爲本幣如最近市價每「蒲式耳」約値美金五角是也</p>
<p>華洋麥市因計算單位與金銀本位幣之不同故粉麥業中通行一種換算簡法據該業中人告記者以洋麥市價換算滬市價先以「三三」歸每蒲式耳價其商數再以美匯歸除之卽得洋麥每石折値規元數若欲折成每担價格祇需再以一百三十九或一百四十歸除卽得茲列成算式如下</p>
<p>（洋麥價÷３３）÷美匯　÷１４０＝澳麥每担價値規元數···㈠</p>
<p>例如十月十七日坎拿大電十月期小麥每蒲式耳計値美金四角八分又八分之一假定該日美匯規元一百兩値美金三十元又十六之五則坎拿大麥每担市價折合規銀三兩四錢三分六厘其式如下</p>
<p>（４８１２５美金元÷３３石）÷３０．３１２５／１００美金元÷１．４０担二規元３．４３６兩</p>
<p>右第一式中應予注意者爲「以「三三」歸洋麥市價」此「三三」應爲一·三三石「或「三·三斗」因美量每蒲式耳等華量三·四○三一二五一斗或·三四○三一二五一石該業俗例捨比較精　之「·三四」而以「·三三」歸洋麥市價實屬費解推測言之大抵以「三三」歸除計算上記憶上比較容易耳是故改用「三四」歸除則結果似可比較精確焉以「·三三」或「·三四」歸除洋麥市價得洋麥每担價値美金數</p>
<p>（澳洋麥市價÷．３３）＝（．４８１２５÷．３３）＝１．４５８美金元</p>
<p>次以美匯除每担洋麥價値美金數則得每担洋麥價値規元數如下</p>
<p>（１．４５８美金÷３０．１２５／１００）＝４．８１１規元兩（每石洋麥價値）</p>
<p>若欲與華麥相比較尚須以「一三九」或「一四○」除之折成每担洋麥價値規元數如下</p>
<p>（４．８１１規元兩÷１．４０担）＝３．４３６規元兩（每担價格）</p>
<p>再者第一式中「·三三」若以「·三四」代入則所得結果較小於前者新算式如下</p>
<p>（洋麥價÷３４石）÷美匯÷１．４０担＝洋麥每但價値規元數······㈡</p>
<p>今再以十月十七日之例列入推算則：</p>
<p>（·４８１２５美金÷．３４石）÷３０．３１２５／１００美金÷１．４０担＝３．３３５規元兩</p>
<p>兩者相較後者較前者計少規元銀一錢零一厘是其計算所得似勝於前者而洋麥較華麥可升一二錢之説與計算上之不精確似有相當之關係也</p>

<h3 id="c166">新婚之夜（四） <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>秀姑娘的兩眼腫得睜不開了，她兩脚縮在肚子上完全像隻蝦螟，緊緊地縮着，絲毫也不敢動，牛怕驚醒了那個她生來連在夢裏都没有遇到過的醜而　怕的老猴子｜她給他取的尊號｜想到昨晚的事情，她又不覺地抖了起來，眼的周圍又潮濕了，兩顆冰冷的淚珠，由頬上滾了下來，一直停在白嫩的𩓐子上。</p>
<p>｜唉｜昨夜我是用了生平的氣力來抵抗，所以能夠支持到今天，我還是我自已，我自已的靈魂，我自已的肉體，我自已的獨身主義｜但是今晚上怎麽辦呢？我没有氣力了，我的右手手已受了重傷，幾乎不能動彈了，唉｜天，我怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>｜姨媽太豈有此理了，她還是個懂詩書禮義的女人，而且兒子都在外邊做事，爲什麽做出這樣没有良心，没有人道的事呢？把我嫁給這樣面貌猙獰，全世界找不出的醜男人做老婆，簡直比砍了我的頭，或者一塊塊割下我的肉還痛苦，還受罪。哼｜媒人，好一個殺人不見血的媒人。她自已的女兒都要跑到外面去自由結婚，爲什麽來管束我，陷害我呢？</p>
<p>｜母親太可憐了，她爲了我，不知哭過多少次，我不能怪她；父親太凶了，菩薩要給他苦吃的，將來我變了鬼也得報復，他太没有良心了，怎麽把我嫁個這樣的人呢？······</p>
<p>浮在秀姑娘腦海中的，除了怨恨，悲憤，傷心，失望之外，還有那可怕的老猴子的猙獰的面孔，而且這面孔的印象好似被膠漆黏着一般，永遠不能去掉。『呵，你醒來了｜再不要哭了，給别人聽到不像樣的，今晚我們可以好好地······』</p>
<p>天呵，原來這猙獰的，可怕的猴子臉已來到秀姑娘自已的身邊了；她害怕得幾乎又要大呌起來了，猛然間聽到隔壁有切切私語的聲音，只得忍耐着轉過臉向裏邊。</p>
<p>乘着去小便的機會，秀姑娘頭髮篷鬆地跑到她的媒人｜大姨母家裏去了。本來她昨天剛來到這百多人家的大院子油榨冲，並不知道姨母住在何處，只曉得距離自已不遠。當她靜悄悄地由後門走出來時，看見一個放牛的孩子，她問明了目的地後，就拚命地跑去了，那孩子還以爲她是客人，因爲她的相貌和昨天大不相同了。</p>
<p>抱英園裹頓時熱閙起來了：遠近的鄰居·不論男女老幼，都跑了來看這美麗而奇怪的新娘。</p>
<p>「快到裏面去，把房門關了起來，這多人來看，眞醜死了。」</p>
<p>大姨媽簡直氣得面如死灰，她覺得秀姑娘太倒自已的面子了·不但是外甥女的關係，而且是自已做的媒人。</p>
<h3 id="c167">駡 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>樂到極點，便「不知手之舞之·足之蹈之」眞情之流的自然流露，確是這樣不容遏制的。同時，假若外界給予人們的剌激太深，則爲剌激所𢳄起的强烈的反應·也會使人情不自禁地頓足錐胸，逼得非駡不可。</p>
<p>但拿僞君子的眼光來看，駡是頂野蠻不過的，他們雖則背着良心，幹了不少損人利已的壞事，表面上却滿口甜蜜，企圖不露半點兒痕跡，誰若要鳴不平，想把心中淤積的僨火發洩，不管你心直口快，句句是道，他們總極力反對，不，嚴加干涉。處於這時代，僞君子的權威高壓在他人之上，所以人的眞情，竟然多少被兇燄掩蓋住了。</p>
<p>其實，反應節Ｒ｜Ｂ｜Ｓ這公式，斷斷乎没有例外，我們冷眼旁觀，旣處處有不平存在，即處處有該駡之事。所謂駡，祇要是嚴正的批評，無畏的反抗，則正義之伸，也許由此而始。像現在，有的爲當不仁，有的昏淫無道，有的兄弟鬩牆，有的厚顔變節，有的墮落自戕，等而下之，竟至賣女求榮，認賊作父；如此奇形怪狀，直是指不勝數｜平心而論，那個不該痛駡？説句笑話，若要供求相應，就趕辦幾個駡科速成班，也算不得多事呢。</p>
<p>越怕駡，越有醜處給人家駡，也就越發禁不住駡；要人不駡，除非自已肯洗心革面，由黑暗的重圍中衝出來，向着光明的程途前進。</p>
<p>再爲駡的人設想，也不好説笑駡由我，於是乎信口慢駡，當駡怕駡，或竟先駡後不駡。彌衡打鼓駡曹，聲色俱厲，幾死不屈，這是値得我們效法的精神！不然的話，就算自已膽大，到處亂駡，把人駡得走頭無路，但這與眞情的自然流露，畢竟不知相去幾千百萬里了。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>「現在他們搬到香港去住了。你的姊姊，每天駡廣州的當局。她説得很可笑。她説，哥哥之侵吞公欵是當局所指示的。不然他那敢這樣的大膽。一旦給人家告發了，便把責任推到哥哥身上來了。我以爲總算幸運了。貪官污吏要做到什麽時候才有止期呢。</p>
<p>『話多了，以後再寫吧。再會。讓我説，我是你的佩珠，謹上。十一月十日。』</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>劉佩珠的姊姊佩珍是在上海鼎鼎大名的買辦階級任啓明的第二個媳婦。她的丈夫任錦華，是中國現代最時髦的人材，｜｜美國哈佛大學畢業的經濟科碩士，現在財政部裏當一等參議，每月只到京領乾薪一次，其餘的日子都是在上海逍遙。花他的時光最多的還是跳舞塲。其次便是搓麻雀了。當海泉由廣州動身來上海的時候，他的姊姊告訴了他，劉家的佩珍姊是住在上海法租界霞飛路Ｈ坊的四十五號。呌他帶了一些南方的食品和茶葉到上海來做拜訪任家夫妻時的　見。</p>
<p>『在上海什麽東西買不出來？呌他帶這些無聊的東西去，不討厭麽？』還是姊夫劉偉英通人情，把海泉想説的話先説出來了。『上海買的是上海買的。我們的是我們的。你知道什麽｜物輕人意重。』姊姊徵笑着叱她的丈夫。姊夫便笑着走開了。海泉當下便想，中國該完了。因爲中國的民族，｜｜尤其是男性的同胞，都太不長進，太無志氣了。平日磨拳擦掌談革命，談得滿臉通紅，額筋憤起的大小革命英雄，一走到女性面前，便要跪下去軟化了，丢掉了從前的主張，喪失了從前的志氣。試看中國今日的偉人們，那一個不是受制於閫内的？｜｜不是怕老婆，便是怕姨太太，不是怕姨太太，便是怕姘頭。到後來，一切國家大事也是取决於一二個没智識的女性了。天下那有不完了的。</p>
<p>海泉到上海來後，十分不願意去拜訪那些在物質的享受上顯然有階級之别的人們。他知道某洋行是任家的通訊處，於是把姊姊呌他帶來的食物，只附了一張名片，交給那家洋行轉交去了。自已只託詞學校的事弄淸楚了後，便來拜候他們。</p>
<p>大槪是姊夫和佩珠都有信給了佩珍。海泉間接由曾先生口中聽見霞飛路Ｈ坊的任家夫婦，很希望他到他們家裏去頑。於是他覺得自已太神經過敏，也太傲慢了，有點對不住任家的人。同時又接到了姊姊的來信，責備他何以久久不去拜訪那家的親戚，未免太無禮貌了。</p>
<p>無可奈何，他在一天的禮拜日上午，决意到任家去走一趟了。他聽見人説過，在上海拜訪朋友，最好是在上午十點十一點的時候。因爲他們在下半天和晚上多是不在家。</p>

<p>— 豈文</p>
<p>在女字下面，通常雖然和男字下面一樣裝着一個「人」字或是「子」字，但男的這方面總很少把女的那方面認爲和自已　様的是「人」或「子」。當俄國還有皇帝的時代，他們就有一句俗諺，呌做「牝鳥不是鳥，女人不是人。」我國的「大成至聖」也吁嗟乎遇：「惟女子與小人爲難養也！」時至今日，則没有了皇帝的俄國的女人，據觀察過新俄的人説，不特已成了「人」，且有駸駸乎駕男人而上之之勢；但在中國，則女子仍在難養中；反之，即認爲易養，而玩弄之，並且有玩弄得至矣盡矣，蔑以加矣之勢。</p>
<p>認女子爲難養者，總必是經濟不很寛裕的朋友，他們看見别人娶一個老婆，雖然化了多多少少的聘金，尚不肯爽爽快快地上轎，固已嚇得魂驚膽戰，即在百貨大公司的玻璃窗内見到陳列着一雙女絲襪，廉價祇賣十八元的廣告，也必定嚇得目瞪口呆。</p>
<p>但在另一方面，女人又像什麽人者養得起似的。我們試翻開一份日報來，在賣女子用品的廣告上固然畫着一個個「巧笑倩兮」的美麗女郎：就是專供墮落男子注射或服用的藥品廣告上，也多是一個個美目盼兮」的摩登少女；香烟廣告上夾着那支「烟絲金黃」「價錢公道」的好香烟的手指總會是一隻玉人纎手；搽鷄眼用的藥品廣告上的那張圖，又何嘗不是翹着玉趾的美人？甚而至於報紙副刊上的一長方眉畫，十有九也得仰仗一個時裝女人，好像在招呼投稿者曰：本刊特聘女子招待。至於畫報之若無女校高材生之流，自然不特編者掃興，即閲者也怕不能津津有味，······總而言之，是女雖名「人」，其實是「物」！</p>
<p>然則將怎樣呢？這也容易，就是祇須女人把目已當作「人」，男人也不要把她當作「物」就行。至於男女雙方都當作「人」看了之後的益處何在呢？那至少專門供給社會新聞的兩性悲醜劇總能因而少出現幾椿罷？</p>
<h3 id="c170">世界最高的建築物｜摩天閣 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊</p>
<p>「世界最高的建築物是那一個？」假如有誰這樣問。</p>
<p>「當然是紐約的烏爾瓦斯囉！」我想你一定要這樣回答。然而事實上並不如此，鳥爾瓦斯的榮華，早已成爲過去的夢痕，而現最高的建築物是被稱爲摩天閣的恩派亞斯脱特了。</p>
<p>這一建築物於去年五月間完成·高八十五層，有二萬人居住，幾幾乎與一個小都市的人口相等。</p>
<p>那末這個摩天閣在什麽地方呢？當然是紐約啦。本來高建築是紐約的特産物，據最近的統計，二十層以上的屋子，在美國有三百七十七所·而紐約便佔了半數，所以這個高建築物又在紐約·是毫無足奇的事。</p>
<p>現在讓我將這恩派亞斯脱特略爲介紹一下。這摩天閣的屋頂有一個飛船繫留所，就此一端，已爲世界上的創舉。因爲太高的原故，必定要有高速度的乘降機，否則即使搬運一件小物品，由最下到最高層，也非走到天黑不可·所以必需有一種在一分鐘内能夠乘至六十層的乘降機。</p>
<p>幾年以前，前述的烏爾瓦斯·確是世界的寵兒·高五十八層，約當日本東就「丸之内」的七倍半·但至前三年·却突然有了高六十五層的孟哈丹銀和六十八層的克拉易斯拉出現，所以烏爾瓦斯早已不成其爲寵兒，及至去年這摩天閣一經出世·於是直降到第四位去了。</p>
<p>至於這摩天閣出現的理由·當然免不了是地産企業家的竸爭·因爲高建築便於宣傳，易於出租。而且美國人有一種「世界第一」的創造慾，譬如説某人某地有了一所高建築，「好的，我一定不服輸·就是借錢也要來一個·」於是這高屋便在這竸爭心中産生了。然而這終於是一方面的觀察·根本原因還因爲美國是　個黃金國·「只要有錢·便什麽也能做到的吧」·這種説法·正是摩天閣出現的眞正的理由了。</p>

<p>— 萬居</p>
<p>法國哲學家巴斯加爾曾經説過：從行爲的見地看來，善惡是隨着地方而不同的問題。換句話説，人類的行爲是有地域性的，在這兒呌做罪惡，在那兒却呌做美行，在這塊地方一般人　某種行爲是可笑的，但在那塊地方則爲一般人所讚許。眞的，所謂「風俗」也者，確是一種極不可思議，而又極有趣味的東西。斯丹達爾有一部著作呌做論愛情」，裏面所描寫的，尤其是描寫瑞士柏爾勒一帶少女的習俗，頗饒興趣。</p>
<p>瑞士的女子在靑春時期的行爲是浪漫的，天眞的；而那兒的家庭對於這種行爲，也持着一種特殊的態度。據説有一個著名的法國軍官，某次因登山須在奥柏朗地方一個極荒僻而又極秀美的山谷中過夜。到了山中之後，他便借宿在山谷裏一位官吏的家裏，這是當地最富有而且最有勢力的一個人家。這個客人進去的時候就注意着一個芳齡十六生得非常嬌艶的少女。這個少女是這家主人的女孩。那晚剛好有個鄉村的跳舞會；因爲這個少女生得太美麗動人了，這個軍官免不了設法去親近她，奉承她。最後他竟鼓起勇氣來，問她可不可以讓他晚上偷到她的房裏過夜。這個少女答説：一不行，我是跟我的表姊一塊兒睡的；不過晚上我可以到你的房裏來。」晚餐吃完了，旅客站了起來。妙齡的少女便拿着洋燈送他到他的房裏去；他看見這種情形，以爲今晚總可以享到艶福了。</p>
<p>可是這個少女帶着天眞爛漫的神氣説：「不，我應當先請求媽媽的許可。」這句話眞像晴天的霹靂一樣，把他的魂都嚇掉了，可是他還没有來得及攔她，她已出去了；軍官只好放大了膽子，跟在她後面，濳伏在那用木板建築的客廳外面偷聽他們究竟講些什麽。他聽見那位少女撒嬌地要求她母親許可她所希望的事情；結</p>
<p>果，她達到目的了。這個老婦人對着她那已經躺在舖上的丈夫説：「老東西，你不是贊成托麗妮麗去跟那位軍官過夜嗎？」「十二分願意，她的老丈夫回答；像這様的人，就是把我的女人借給他過夜，我也願意的。」接着那老婦人便對托麗妮麗説：「那麽，好！去吧；不過要勇敢點，不可把裙子脱去······」</p>
<p>黎明時份，這位少女從客人的床上起來，她仍是潔白無瑕的，晚上旅客尊重了她的意思，並没有强迫她做她所認爲過分的事情。她把被褥床舖整理好，把咖啡和牛奶弄好拿來給這個軍官，隨後她坐在舖上，同他一塊兒用早餐。吃完早餐後，她把蓋在乳房上的胸衣剪下一塊給他道：「留着這個做我們這幸福的夜晚的紀念吧！我終身不會忘掉這晚的·········」於是，她給這個軍官一個最後的接吻，驚鴻一般地逃去了，以後他就再没有見到她了。</p>

<p>他們全部的生活：吃飯，睡覺，穿衣服；他們終生的計劃：做官，發財，討老婆。</p>
<p>我們的社會是這様的老社會，我們的靑年是這様的老靑年；説什麽「世界進化迎頭趕上去」，眞是開着眼做夢，｜｜等看人家的「桌子跳舞」罷！</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>九一八事變以來，日本對於世界列强，處處用挑戰態度，感情非常惡劣，不免造成第二次大戰的局面·因此積極備戰·到底日本地小民寡，不堪一擲，於是東京高等女學校長會議，議决將東京女學生三萬五千人，武裝起來，受嚴格的軍事訓練，聞陸軍省甚爲贊同，已允撥步槍三萬五千枝，及手槍毒瓦斯防具等，從明春起，開始訓練，自此將有大批娘子軍，出現於世界舞臺矣·</p>
<p>任何黷武主義的國家，雖有全國皆兵之制，但徵調僅及於男性，而女性則尚無聞，即有參加作戰的英雄，亦多出於自動的去告奮勇，並不是被動的强迫當兵，現在日本旣强迫女子受軍事訓練，以後推而廣之，方滿十齡的男子，亦可强迫赴前綫作犠牧品，此後的局面，造物所産生的人類，無非供砲火炸彈的自的物，請大家覺悟罷，請大家明白罷，所謂九國公約，華府會議，軍縮會議等等，不要再去搭空架子·擺華容道了，拆穿西洋鏡，大家拚命製造些國民出來·做軍閥們的犠牲品，</p>
<p>或者説，不，「日本訓練娘子軍，另有一種特别妙用，日本素來以善用美人計著名，你不看此次調查團到日本，無論開什麽會，什麽宴，多挑選漂亮女子參加歡迎麽，假定一旦發生戰事，驅策五六萬千嬌百媚的嬌艶女子，赴前敵作戰，試問那敵人還忍用飛機大砲來肆其煑鶴焚琴的手段麽，眞是一個絶好的美人計</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個商店裏的學徒，今年還祇十六歲，曾受過高等小學的敎育，因爲家境困難的緣故，以致不能繼續求學，獲得較高的智識。這是在我每次思索到的時候，深引爲憾事的！</p>
<p>是去年的春天，當我在學校裏畢業了以後，受了上述環境的壓迫，賴我的父親的一個朋友，舉薦到這因繁華而被稱爲「東方巴黎」的上海來學業。這一年多的當中，雖然過着每天揥地揩檯子，客人來拿烟倒茶，有時候還要爲各高級職員做跑腿，過機械式而無意義的生活之下，個人的生活總算暫時安定了。並且尚有空閒，可以看書閲報，經理人等待我也不十分苛刻，比到其他的商店工廠中。與我同樣地位的人，總要舒服得多。</p>
<p>但是據我在平時的靜觀默察中，看到剛滿年限的師兄們的辛勞的代價，每月三元的也有，每月五元的也有，即使高級的職員們，至多也不過二三十元。看他們仰事俯蓄，總覺得拮据萬分，那歡喜浪遊的先生們是更無論矣，而况從每月三五元的學徒，要升到每月二三十元的高級職員的地位，在這半新式的商店中，豈是容易。所以我瞻顧前途，禁不住不寒而慄！</p>
<p>我的父親快要五十歲了，雖然現在的家庭，尚是我的父親勉力支持，但在不久的將來，這負荷的重任，無疑義的必從我的父親的肩上，卸給於我。關於二老的瞻養，弟妹的扶植，一黠没有能力的我，怎能負擔得住。所以我在這深思遠慮之下，不得不預備棄了前途黯淡的現在的事業，而想從事於較有希望的事業。但我在這不明需要無所適從的現在，又怎敢輕易妄動呢！</p>
<p>最近，在貴報上，看見了六十週年紀念的各種設施，有「店員通訊」一欄專爲本市的工商界解答疑難的問題，在我，宛如在其黑如漆的暗室中，發現了一盞明燈相似。用敢不揣冒昧，抱十二萬分的熱忱，希望</p>
<p>先生對我這徘徊在十字路口的靑年，指示一條光明的大道。</p>
<p>徐覺人十二，一·在上海</p>
<p>編者按：徐君這對信引起了我們無限的同情。本來，在這世界經濟恐慌日益嚴重化的情勢之下，大多數的人都是受着經濟的壓迫的，您正不必因此而灰心。至於要找一個認爲滿意的職業，那原是很不容易的事，而况『做一行怨一行』已成爲普遍的現象　吃綢緞飯的羡慕銀行職員；執煤炭業的欲改執布業。但從前也不是有句慣語呌做『行行出狀元』嗎？這意思就是説，祇要自已肯努力，必有出頭的日子，所以我們對於徐君的主張，却不敢輕易贊同。假如有較好而有希望的事業，固然是以改就爲愈，但也要看您對於牠的興趣而定，倘貿然以酬報之多寡爲改業的標準，那我們以爲前途必有不堪設想的危險。</p>
<p>况且經理待您很好，又有空間的光陰可以讀書閲報，在目今學徒中，誠如尊言『要算舒服的了』，關於求知方面，如果有志的話·那是不成問題的，今細閲來信，文字很是流利，以十六歲的人，便有這樣的造詣，可見於書報方面已很用了一番苦功。我們希望徐君繼續的努力下去，前途誠未可限量呢！</p>
<p>至於您的家庭問題，那是日後的話，（因爲您的父親才祇五十歲）須知時代是瞬息萬變的，祇要您能努力於學業，忠勤於職務，以待機會之來臨，似可不必過於顧慮。</p>
<p>未了，我們舉一些例子作爲您努力的興奮劑。如創辦三友實業社的沈九成先生是做手藝織褲子衣帶出身：豫豐紗</p>

<p>㈢一切不了解</p>
<p>孟國寳在沉靜的環境裏，只管嗑了瓜子想心事，不知不覺之間，已是把那一碟瓜子，吃了個乾凈。時候大槪是不短了，而且曾聽到王二嫂打了兩個呵欠。自已知道鄉下人睡得早的不要擾了人家不能睡覺以至於人家不高興，便站起來道，老二，多謝你的茶和瓜子，明天上午，我來找你談談，你在家嗎？王老二道：可以的，可以的，我早一點回來歇中伙就是了。孟國寳又道：王二嫂多謝，明天見。王二嫂急切中，答覆不出什麽話來，只是站着笑了一聲，於是孟國寳很高興的回去了。他家裏有父母，有哥嫂，有姪子姪女是個大家庭。父親和哥哥，每年將田裏出産換來的錢拿給他去作學費，所希望的就是他將來可以作官把門庭改換一下這些錢自然的都回來了。現在他雖没有作官，然而他是一個大學生。這兩年來鄉下的老紳士是秀才舉人出身的一齊打倒，以前秀才舉人代鄉下人評　是非，作中作證的事，都改爲由省裏或南京北京上海回來的學生來辦，換句話説，就是學生來作鄉下紳士了。這樣一來，孟國寳也就是個準紳士。而且孟國寳回來的時候，雙路口鎭上的鄉自治會第三區，許多先生們都和他來往。這第三區，便是個小縣衙門，孟國寳和那些人都要好，可見他也就不同平常了。因之孟國寳的父親孟二老爹，他大哥國器，二哥國華，都十分的高興。國寳在王老二打麥塲上乘凉，二老爹在打麥塲外去窺探幾回，家裏人都不敢睡覺？及至他回來了，二老爹迎到門口，首先笑問道：你和王老二倒談得那樣好，那是個無用的人。孟國寳歎了一口氣道：唉！他是一個被壓迫者喲！二老爹是個念過幾句舊書的人，這句話的意思，倒是懂了，便道：並没有那個欺侮他呀。孟國寳道：他不是自已没有田，種着人家的田嗎？二老爹道：對了！他種了王子賓先生一担種，汪有道先生，一擔二斗種。孟國寳重聲道：他是受大地主支配的人，豈不是一個被壓迫者。二老爹對於這話，依然是不大明白。可是兒子是個大學生，他説的話，多少有些理由，就不能再駁了，跟着他，走進門裏去。門裏是個四方天井，家裏人都在那裏坐着乘凉，現他進來，一律都站了起來。他母親便迎上前笑道，今天晚上，你還着書嗎？我在你屋子裏，已經點了根蚊香，凉了一壼茶在棹上。孟國寳道，喲！棹上放有凉茶嗎？我在棹上放了一本經濟學。他母親道，一本書，潑一點水也不要緊，過一會子就乾了。孟國寳道：怎樣不要緊？那本書是八塊錢買的。他這句話不要緊，在天并裹的人，不約而同的，呵喲了一聲。</p>

<p>本刊所負之使命。約略言之。厥有二端。一喚起民衆對於建築之興會。藉以直接發展建築業。間接鞏固上海之繁榮。一爲忠實有統系之建築史料。並由專家主撰。嚴格之指導批評。俾以促進現代建築事業之進步。同爲後來者據建築史者之取材。秉此二端。孜孜勤求。並搜羅各種圖案紀載統計消息。務使本刊並爲動態之歷史。以順應環境。以致力專門。責任所在。想爲讀者所樂聞乎。</p>
<p>進而言之。建築之爲專門事業。不持謝儈設計而已也。即如材料。一磚一石之微。亦何獨不爲專門。故供給建築之材料者。初不得與其他商店相提並論。而本刊之發行。力主求全。故論建築尤致意於材料。上海經營建築材料者。實繁有徒。有鑒於此。其惠然肯來。以提携者謀發展乎。</p>
<p>再者建築與地産。自有絶對聯帶之關係。故本刊於地産事業。亦特加注意。凡關於地産價値。買賣消息。以至經營地産事業者之情况。無不率爲披露。俾得以地産之眞相。公告國人。蓋天下事業之求發展。必先求人了解。今本刊盡使人了解之責。其於地産事業之發達。必可因而激增。所望經營地産者。隨時見助。共同致力。他年上海之繁盛富庶。或更有千百倍於今日者。同人不敏。願爲之先驅矣。</p>

<p>— 劉福泰</p>
<p>歷史家不是常常把歷史寫在書本上面的，因爲書本容易毁壞·假如寫在建築物上，那就可以長久保存而不容易毁壞。我們可以從殘存的遺跡上知道上古人類的工作，比較從筆跡上知道的多而且眞實，我們現在能不能在建築物上寫我們的歷史，希望像我們中國萬里長城與埃及的金字塔一樣的長久？</p>
<p>希望現在的人能夠理想他們自已是好像一個將來的考古家，掘出現在建築物殘存的遺跡，這個考古家可以得到最有興趣的與新奇的現在人民的生活情形，可以給他一個最奇的與驚異的感覺，有時候他們一定去看現在遺留的樓房，紀念物，都市的殘跡，而用一種批評的眼光，他們看了之後，就可以知道當初的這些建築是爲了工作的，道路是供給汽車走的，他們的興趣立刻就從私見而轉爲公見了。總起來説，這樣我們可以看見我們全部的歷史了。因爲這種歷史不是像那些私見的歷史家或者是創造神話者用字句來叙述這種事物的沿革，譬如太史公史記上有些憑感情的叙述與盤古開天地的神話。但是這種建築上的歷史，是永久的，眞實的，不私見的。建築師是實在眞誠的歷史家，他的記錄是眞實而不容有偏見的，一定要受時代環境的命令與支配，不能隨便去證明實業的需要與人民的要求，因此建築師是遺留下眞實記錄的人，試理想去尋兩個同時代的建築歷史家，那就好像同一個模形的兩座樓房，就是他們記錄的結果了。</p>
<p>普通的歷史家寫歷史的記錄，未免是憑着私見的觀察，但是經過長久的時间以後，他的記錄，被人認爲是眞實的事實，於是個人的基礎的情形，被他失去了。但是建築家完全是不會有這種變更的，建築家的建設，是照着環境的要求與時代的急迫，因此這種記錄存留一直到建築物毁壞以後。</p>

<p>急待開關東方大港</p>
<p>建築事業，有關一　之隆替者至鉅。且於人生幸福有密切之　繫，歐美諸國，建築事業之進展，日滋月茁。研究建築學術之出版物，更充斥書肆。反觀吾國，關於建築學術之專門著述及定期刊物，幾如鳳毛麟角，不可多觀。申報當局，有　於此，乃有『建築專刊』之輯。申報編者來會訪晤本會常務委員杜彦耿先生，詳談建築事業之改進問題，杜先生告以今日建築界之任務。一言以蔽之曰，須從實際工作做起，爲謀國家實業之發達，與夫整個建築界之進展計，非亟亟於此不可，並詳述其種種計畫，因執筆記之如下。</p>
<p>國内建築刊物，已屬絶無僅有，然試一究其内容，則長篇累牘，無非空泛之談，於國家實業之發展，建築界之實際工作，初無具體之貢獻也。余今所希望於『建築專刊』者，祛除一般之錯悞，而能指示建築界以實際工作，庶不負發刊之原旨也。</p>
<p>開關商港，爲晚近建築界所負使命之至重且鉅者，先總理於建國方略之實業計劃中，已闡明開關東方·北方·南方三大港之計劃。而實現其計劃，則有待於吾建築界同人，及有志於建築事業者，應如何努力以促其實現，庶幾完成先總理之計劃。初步進行宜從東方大港之開關着手，然後再及於北方大港與南方大港之開闢，並深望國人之能投資於是也。</p>
<p>開闢東方大港</p>
<p>東方大港在杭州灣中，位於乍浦岬與澉浦岬之間，形勢與交通，均佔優勝，一旦開而闢之，則今日之一片荒蕪，安知將來不成爲東方唯一之熱鬧市塲，而與美之紐約，英之倫敦媲美。百年前，誰能預知紐約倫敦今日之繁榮。關於開闢東方大港，先總理已有詳細之計劃，今摘其語日，『自乍浦岬至澉浦岬之距離約十五英里，應自此岬至彼岬，建一海堤，而於乍浦一端離山數百尺之處，開一缺口，以爲港之正門，此種海堤可分爲五段，每段各長三英里，因現在先築一段，長三英里，闊一英里半，已得三四方英里之港面，足供用矣。（待續）</p>

<p>— 心</p>
<p>很奇怪的，許多人看影片，只注意在正片，似乎副片是無足輕重的，這是極大的錯誤！恐怕也就是造成中國影界，漠視副的大原因。</p>
<p>現在通行的劇片，不外下列幾種：㈠新聞：㈡滑稽：㈢歌舞：㈣孩劇或狗劇；㈤炭畫；㈥科學：㈦風景；㈧其他！</p>
<p>我們在國片中找一找，總計副片，不到二十部，當然的，劇片在攝製方面，是一樣的費事；而且又賣不出錢，所以除去哄動一時的新聞，如運動比賽等等，差不多没人肯費工夫金錢去攝製，劇片的缺乏，就造成了現在國片不振的狀况，並且開映國片，（以無聲居多）　以前，加了外國副片，未免不倫不類，所以不得已，把國片，有時無意義的去拖長：或者是因陋就簡的剪短，使牠一定要有一萬一千尺左右，夠一小時三刻開演之用，没有伸縮，那却是一件極牽强而爲難的事</p>
<p>以現在光景説：在中國電影人才缺乏的時候，攝不用演員，或練習新進演員的短片，並不是難事，例如新聞方面：大偉人的飛來飛去，各種實業的建設，大典盛會。無日無之：好材料很多，一定會引起觀衆的興趣。風景方面，中國爲偉大的古代建築：有華北江南各種不同的風土：蒙古新疆以及雲桂的生活；那一様不是我們所喜歡看的？况且大江南北，山明水秀的天然美景，也攝不勝攝。説到歌舞片：也不妨攝些中國舞台劇，不但可以調劑看客的口味，即使運銷到外國，也是很好的文化宣傳品。比梅博士到美國去，更有深長久遠的收效。中國不是在努力攝滑稽片嗎？更應當由短片試演入手，不然不會有好成績的，羅克卓别林，以及勞瑞哈代，那一個不是短片中淘練出來的呢？·········</p>
<p>再舉一個例説，十年前的米高美，出産正片很少，所有的精力，全放在副片上。現在呢？地位超過任何片廠，當然短片的功勞佔很大，而且到今年，平均量數，短片仍二倍於正片，這才是製片廠的一個好模範，好政策！</p>
<p>如果認爲短片，不受人歡迎，那是事實可以證明的。例如最單調風景片，若能用巧妙的攝影，配以高山流水的歌曲或音樂，那是多藝術化？怎麽會乾燥呢？</p>
<p>『事在人爲』，要國片發達，爲藝術工作：那麽當由小處着目，從精製短片作起！</p>
<p>兩位黑衣女郎，你猜是誰？</p>
<p>她們就是陳玉梅（右）和黎明暉（左）：都是天一公司的兩位台柱。</p>
<h3 id="c190">名星亦當裁縫 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 猛虎</p>
<p>吉爾勃阿特倫（GillbirlAdiain）現在有一個很好的生意經，就是去做米高梅公司女星們衣裝的設計者，他的確是一位有天才的藝術專家，嘉寳主演的奈何天裏的奇異的爪哇和俄國衣裝，增加了嘉寳不少美媚，這便他天才表現的一個好例。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c191">評「小女伶」 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 湘石</p>
<p>編劇最感因難的，就是在開始編劇的時候，很想編一個意識健全的劇本，但是到了全部劇本完成，爲了情節·結搆，穿挿，·········等種種關係，往往會把原來的意識消失了一大半，等到影片拍成，如果表演得没有力量，或竟把原有的意識弄得只賸此微影踪了。</p>
<p>如果要在「小女伶」的劇本裏面找出一點意識，就只隠約地浮着一些「慈」「孝」的影子。我推想編劇者的本意，想編成一部感人極深的倫理劇，但是反面的描寫太多，把觀衆的眼光轉移到反面的描寫上去，弄得喧賓奪主。</p>
<p>就整個的故事來講，前半部描寫一個舊家庭的没落，後半部描寫悍婦無賴的自作自受，自首至尾，用一個天眞爛漫的小姑娘做連貫，結搆頗好。描寫王氏的悍潑，及陳乃新的狠毒，有人以爲過分一點，但我以爲世上儘有窮兇極惡的人，只是我們少遇着吧。</p>
<p>導演有好幾處很覺巧妙，像王氏擲碎寄仲的照架，夾寫寄仲在廚房伏地痛哭</p>
<p>又王氏和陳乃新互相毆打，化爲張小琳與另一小伶人演習槍法，動作姿勢，都相彷佛。此類鏡頭，旣合情理，且饒趣味。至於王氏與乃新赴跑馬場時之車輪特寫，與牧羊卷開演時觀客之車輪特寫，重複用之，似乎無甚意味。</p>
<p>表演以主角袁美雲爲最佳，有人説·她本來是一個小女伶·現在來飾一個銀幕上的小女伶，自然非常適合。這話似乎有理·其實不對，因爲戲劇電影中的表演，和實際生活不同，譬如有一個軍官，呌他在舞臺上或電影中飾一個軍官，他未必表演得好，所以袁美雲在「小女伶」中的成功，乃是她確有表演的天才，並不靠她的生活經騐·因爲她的生活過程中，决不會有「小女伶」劇中悲歡離合的經騐。</p>
<p>其他演員的表演·都在水平綫上·舒麗娟的悍婦·和葛福榮的懦夫，表演的機會較多，但是只能引起觀衆淺薄的笑意，不能使觀衆得到深刻的印象。</p>
<p>光綫，佈景，都還好，收音也很淸晰，可惜有幾處夾着一點雜音，未免有點美中不足！</p>
<h3 id="c192">一般人的近視 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 運</p>
<p>在目前，大家對於一個電影演員的認識，不論是男的演員或女的演員！而特别是女的演員。不免是表面的皮相的，一點不在實際上推求其成功與否，我想這是很危險的。</p>
<p>這個演員的面貌漂亮嗎？她是一個熱情的女郎嗎。或者是他或她的裝飾入時不入時？這差不多成了一般人批評一個電影演員的家常便飯了。</p>
<p>其實，這眞是一個絶大的錯誤。</p>
<p>誰是一個成功的演員？我想只有以「他或她的藝術高超不高超」這一個標準來批評才是對的。電影是一種藝術「這是誰都知道了的，所以一種影片絶不是靠着幾隻漂亮的面孔或一些浮面的表情所能成功的，演員表演的藝術，才是牠唯一的生命素。</p>
<p>因此，一個演員的成功，無疑地，絶不是那些人們皮相的批判所能促成的可憐的，是一般人們的近視。</p>

<p>— 金沙</p>
<p>一個家庭裏没有兒童就覺得枯燥；同時電影裏假使没有兒童也學得太單調。</p>
<p>國産影片中，簡直可以説没有童伶，這實在使我們異常失望。</p>
<p>其實，兒童的表演能力並不比成人低，有許多地方也許只有兒童能表演。兒童的表情是天眞的　没有做作，没有虚僞。像聯華出品的人道中的那位小朋友的表演，眞使我們動情。有許多地方以小孩子來表演能比成人更使人動人，「人道」中的小朋友就是一個好例子。</p>
<p>因此，我們渴望着童伶的産生。自然，要導演訓練一個童伶是比訓練十個成人還要困難，但是我們希望導演先生們别怕難，我希望導演先生能以訓練十個成人的精力在一個童伶的身上。</p>
<p>電影是偉大的，兒童影片尤其偉大｜别忘了偉大的責任啊！導演先生和製片公司！</p>

<p>電影女明星們生活上的奢侈和浪漫，當然不限於好萊塢一個地方，而中國的女明星，又何嘗不然。這裏，單講的是中國女明星生活的一部份，就是出了攝影塲以後，她們所做的什麽？</p>
<p>她們的嗜好，自然不是一樣，在她們完畢了正經的工作，出了攝影塲以後她們所做的無疑的是不會一致。</p>
<p>爲了時間，或是氣候的不同，她們在工作完畢以後所做的工作，也隨了時間和氣候而更變，譬如，在夏季裏，女明星有到高橋海浴塲去游泳的，但是在冬季裏，再不會有去的了。現在只能把普通和日常所做的，寫一點出來。</p>
<p>阮玲玉時常打麻將做消遺，可是不能就此决定她，是一個最愛打麻將的。林楚楚是她的麻將老搭子。她們一同在聯華的第一廠裏服務。夏佩珍也是時常在閑着的時候，借着打麻將消遺的，她也有一個老和她同局的搭子，便是華畹芳。</p>
<p>林楚楚已經有兩個孩子。大的是兒子，小的是女兒，便是黎鏗和黎萱。他們都曾在「人道」一片裏漏過臉。這兩個活潑可愛的孩子，就是林楚楚的第二生命。她能顧到寒暖，飲食，一切關於孩子們康健的職責，有時還須做點孩子們的衣穿，不失爲一個慈母。徐琴芳便和她一樣的愛護她的孩子們，徐女士本來已經有四個孩子了，去年死了一個，現在還有三個。（未完）</p>

<p>Beiping, 2nd – Su Bingwen telegraphed, reporting that this time the Japanese army, using Fularji as a base, dispatched four divisions, totaling about 50,000 to 60,000 troops, advancing in three routes towards our Jingxing, Zhalantun, and the Greater Khingan Range. Over 200 airplanes and over 100 tanks, utilizing smoke bombs and other sophisticated weapons, attacked our army. Fortunately, our soldiers, each with the resolve to kill the enemy, have been engaging in fierce battles in Yaokule, Nianzishan, Huerhula, and other places for days, advancing wave upon wave with indomitable courage. Frontline soldiers, due to insufficient ammunition, all wield broadswords and spears, engaging the Japanese in hand-to-hand combat. The gleam of swords and the shadows of blades, and the sounds of killing shake the heavens. The Japanese army fears us like tigers, retreating at the sight of us. Our First Brigade, under Zhang, continues to hold the original Zhalantun front line. The Japanese propaganda claiming that our army has retreated from Zhalantun is absolutely false. Deputy Commander Pu Bingshan engaged the Japanese army in fierce battles in Yaokule for three days and nights, with Japanese casualties strewn across the fields. Currently, our army has established extremely solid positions in Halasu, Balinmu, and other places. Even if only one soldier remains, we will resist to the end, vowing to die for our country to exalt national prestige. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Hailar dispatch states that Su Bingwen is currently directing military affairs at the front. The fiercest battles are taking place eighty li north of Yaokule at Guangchang. Ma Zhanshan's troops are commanding in Lahama, while Ma himself is commanding the battle of Northern Manchuria in a certain location west of Laha, which has already broken out. Volunteer armies in the Nianzishan area are preparing to advance forward. Japanese troops under Murachima stationed in Laha, totaling 3,000 men, are currently engaged in fierce battles with the volunteer armies of Xu Zihe and Nan Tingfang. The Baiquan volunteer army under Zheng Wen is fighting the Japanese army in Xiaodongdian, Susha, and other areas. The Japanese army is at a disadvantage and appears to be retreating towards Keshan. Cai Hongyou's troops are engaged in fierce battles with newly arrived Japanese troops in Hailun. The Japanese army has dispatched about 100 planes to assist on all fronts. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>A certain military expert in Beiping commented that the area from west of Yaokule to the Greater Khingan Range, stretching over 1,000 li, is composed of towering mountains and dense forests, easy to defend and difficult to attack. Now that Su Bingwen's army has adopted a defensive posture and guerrilla warfare tactics to counter the Japanese army's advance, it may not be easy for them to gain an advantage. The Japanese propaganda claiming to have occupied Zhalantun is not as easy as it seems. (4th, Special Dispatch) Beiping, Harbin, 3rd Wireless – Previously, there were rumors that a Japanese team was surrounded and annihilated by volunteer armies near Baiquan. According to people from the Northeast, this Japanese troop was a unit of about 100 men dispatched from Longjiang to Baiquan. On the night of the 22nd of last month, when they arrived near Fanjiabao, they were suddenly attacked by 50 volunteer soldiers disguised as farmers. The Japanese army was caught off guard and unable to respond, resulting in almost all of them being killed or wounded, with only a dozen barely escaping. The volunteer army also suffered more than half casualties. It was discovered that the volunteer army had learned in advance that the Japanese army would pass through their location, so they secretly hid near the village and launched a sudden attack. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses as a result. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Treating the Eastern Provinces as a Colony</p>
<p>Tokyo – Although Japan has been vehemently denying any intention to annex the Three Eastern Provinces internationally, its actions show that it already regards the Three Eastern Provinces as a Japanese colony. Here are a few pieces of evidence: (1) The Ministry of Finance declared that Manchurian national construction bonds are equivalent to Japanese domestic bonds. (2) The so-called Japan-Manchukuo Economic Control Conference does not allow puppets to participate in discussions. (3) The Colonial Ministry arbitrarily established branch offices in the Three Eastern Provinces, appointing Secretary Ogawa as the head of the office to supervise the puppet organizations. Recently, it also appointed Umetani Mitsusada, the former governor of Hsinchu Prefecture in Taiwan, as an advisor to the branch office and a consultant to the Army Special Service Department to liaise with the military and monitor the puppet state.

(2) Advance from Taianling to Zhangshui and then from Anda Station to Zhonghezhen. (3) Attack Qinggang, Liuda Village, and Xingzhen directly from Tiancaogang. (4) Advance on Sandaozhen from Hailun. (5) Advance from Keshan towards the northeast of Baiquan by way of Wangxian Village. (6) Head directly west to Baiquan from Lindian. (7) Attack Hanjiaju from Fuxiangzhen. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

About 1,000 men from the Japanese Suzuki Brigade have been transferred from Jin to the Chaoyang County border. Our troops in Chaoyang will step up their precautions. The Provincial Security Corps, under Zhao Guozeng, has been transferred to Chaoyang to maintain order. The Japanese army's defense line along the Jin-Chao line is covered with electric nets, and they are rushing to build defensive works day and night. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing – The Military Affairs Commission has organized a Fortress Inspection Committee, comprising one representative each from the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Navy, the Training Supervisor, the General Staff, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Interior, and the Artillery and Engineering Schools. The inspection period is set to begin in January of next year, first inspecting the Yangtze River fortresses and then inspecting other seaports and fortresses. The following methods have been decided: (1) Two weeks before the confirmed inspection date, the internal affairs office will instruct local party and civil administration organizations to inform the public about the areas within the firing range of live artillery fire during the inspection. (2) During the fortress inspection, the river sections within range of the fortress will be closed to navigation. Traffic will be cut off from 3:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily. The Ministry of Communications will order the local navigation administration bureau to instruct all shipping companies and all civilian boats and rafts to stop sailing. (3) During the inspection, the Ministry of the Navy will dispatch a ship with a specially appointed military officer and soldiers to patrol and be responsible for prohibiting boats from sailing. (4) The Navy will notify the commanders of the foreign fleets stationed in China to ensure that warships of all countries anchored within the firing range of the inspected fortresses are withdrawn. (5) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send a document to the consulates of all countries in China, requesting them to inform their respective shipping companies to comply with the suspension of navigation to avoid accidents.

The designated regimental commanders under him are Han Yiqing, Wang Runtang, Liu Xianting, and others, which will soon be announced by the puppet Ministry of Military Affairs.

<p>Nanjing – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously dispatched Lin Donghai to Guangdong to negotiate diplomatic matters, which have been fully discussed. It was originally intended for him to return to Nanjing to report his mission, but Minister Luo believes that as the League of Nations meeting is currently in session, this meeting is crucial for resolving the Sino-Japanese issue. Therefore, he specifically telegraphed Lin to remain in Guangdong temporarily so that the central government's foreign policy can be communicated to Guangdong at any time to achieve effective results in foreign affairs.

<p>Beiping – The Japanese army in Suizhong is plotting to have Chinese kill each other by distributing 400 Type 13 rifles to the Suizhong militias, with 50 rounds of ammunition per rifle, to resist the Volunteer Army. If the Volunteer Army passes through villages without resistance or is allowed to stay, the Japanese army will bomb the entire village upon discovery. Sometimes, a small number of Japanese soldiers, together with the public security team, supervise the militias to attack the Volunteer Army. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing financial circles report that the central government's revenue has slightly improved since September, with increases in customs duties, salt taxes, consolidated taxes, stamp taxes, and tobacco and alcohol taxes. However, mineral taxes have decreased because transportation has been disrupted since the Shanghai Incident, and most mines have been closed. Although some coal mines have occasionally resumed operations, they are difficult to sustain due to the impact of Japanese coal dumping, and almost no taxes can be collected.

Although the 4th is Sunday, they are still working. Many telegrams and reports from various regions have been received. (4th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing – Wang Yutang, the Civil Affairs Commissioner of Qinghai, has arrived in Nanjing to attend the Internal Affairs Conference. He said that the province originally had 14 counties, but the land is vast and difficult to govern. It is planned to select key areas to add six more counties. Wool is the main product of the province, but since the Northeast Incident, roads have been blocked and trade has stopped, causing great economic distress. In order to develop resources and improve transportation, it is planned to build a highway from Yushu to Lanzhou, starting construction next spring. The province's population is sparse, with only 1.5 million people in the entire province, resulting in a lack of manpower to develop resources, and goods are discarded, which is extremely regrettable. It is earnestly hoped that all sectors in the mainland will implement immigration and border settlement to enrich people's lives and strengthen national defense. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>And Release Documents on Japan's Invasion Plan</p>
<p>Matsouka Yosuke Also Meets with Herriot</p>
<p>Geneva – Chinese representatives protested to the League of Nations Secretariat today against its action of disseminating telegrams from "Manchukuo." China's protest is due to the fact that "Manchukuo" is not a recognized country. The Chinese delegation also sent a document to the Secretariat, the contents of which have not yet been announced, but it is said to express opinions on Matsouka's statement. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Geneva – The Chinese government previously submitted a formal document to the League of Nations Inquiry Commission on Manchuria, explaining the Chinese government's views on the Sino-Japanese dispute. Tonight, the Chinese delegation released excerpts from this document. The document stated that China is under continuous attack by Japan, and its sovereignty is constantly violated by Japan, which greatly hinders relations between the two countries. There is also a document of Japan's recently printed modern map of Japan, approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education. The map shows the situation of Japan's outward expansion with five gradually expanding circles. The diameter of the first circle is 1,609 kilometers, and each circle after that adds 1,609 kilometers. When Japan's power reaches the third circle, a part of mainland China, the entire Manchuria, a part of Mongolia, half of Siberia, and a part of the Philippine Islands will all be under Japan's control. By the time it reaches the fourth circle, the entire China, half of Annam, the entire Philippine Islands, the Aleutian Islands, the entire Hawaiian Islands, and a part of Borneo will all be in Japan's pocket. Finally, when it advances to the fifth circle, the entire Pacific coast, such as Alaska, Canada, and the western coast of the United States, will all be under Japan's influence. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Geneva – For days, the secretariat of the League of Nations delegations has been distributing documents from the "Manchukuo" government and public organizations in Manchukuo to the delegations of various countries, causing much complaint from the Chinese delegation. The League of Nations side stated that these documents were sent by the Japanese delegation and requested to be distributed. The League of Nations secretariat has also distributed documents from chambers of commerce and informal organizations sent by the Chinese delegation in the past upon request, and therefore the League of Nations secretariat is not responsible for such matters.

<p>Geneva – Today, it was heard that Simon, chairman of the Committee of Nineteen, expressed his opinion that the League of Nations General Assembly, which is scheduled to begin considering the Sino-Japanese dispute on Tuesday, is expected to conclude its discussions on Friday. This statement has made it more credible that the debate at the General Assembly will be limited to the general outlines of the Lytton Report and avoid making any recommendations. Then, the entire case will be referred back to the Committee of Nineteen, requesting that they exhaust all conciliatory efforts to find a solution. It is becoming increasingly clear that countries are unwilling to take any coercive action. Today, apart from Matsouka and Dr. Gu Weijun making radio speeches in the evening, there was no action from the League of Nations delegations. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Endorsing the Stimson Non-Recognition Doctrine</p>
<p>Establishing an Advisory Committee to Monitor Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Young, the Far East correspondent of the New York World Affairs Institute and advisor to the National Government, who was an attendant on the Lytton Survey Commission and played an important role in the drafting of the Lytton Report, recently published a private proposal on the handling of the Lytton Report in the New York Times, which has attracted much attention in Geneva. The proposal is as follows: (1) The League of Nations General Assembly confirms the effectiveness of the League of Nations Covenant, the Non-War Treaty, and the Nine-Power Treaty, adopts Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report, and reaffirms the Stimson Non-Recognition Doctrine. This General Assembly need not be unanimous to establish an effective resolution. (2) The General Assembly, based on Chapter 10 of the Lytton Report, intervenes in the direct Sino-Japanese negotiations and establishes an advisory committee to assist this process. It recognizes a certain period of hesitation for these negotiations and agrees with the Japanese government during this period that the Japanese army must withdraw from Manchuria. (3) In order to handle the Manchurian issue, it is believed that the General Assembly needs to hold an international conference of related countries. Although it is appropriate for the United States to chair the international conference, it will naturally be happy to participate if Britain and France convene it. The characteristics of this proposal are (1) avoiding putting strong pressure on the Japanese government, and (2) unanimity of the entire assembly is not necessary. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that this cannot be implemented and has expressed its opposition. (Denstu, 4th)</p>

After several times of persuasion, Niu began to eat slightly on the morning of the 4th. Wang Deli did not go on a hunger strike but requested that he and his wife be allowed to have dinner together every day, but the prison rejected this request, fearing that all the prisoners would follow suit.

<h3 id="e28">Military Expansion Amidst Disarmament Talks　Again Mysterious <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>1.  How Will Future Wars Be?</p>
<p>The global situation is increasingly tense, with the Pacific situation being particularly pressing. In this international anomaly of alternating tension and relaxation, those in power in various countries who sincerely seek the welfare of their nations and peoples cannot but proceed with extreme caution, carefully managing affairs. As such, the citizens who are masters of their countries are filled with unease and terror, experiencing more anxiety than comfort. In this critical period, what will be the first war to break out: a Franco-German war, an anti-Soviet war, or a Japanese-American war?</p>
<p>Based on past historical processes, the current objective situation, and the national sentiments between France and Germany, a Franco-German war is entirely possible. However, since 1920, Germany has not yet recovered from the wounds of the Great War. Even if nationalist ideas rise again, and imperialist desires resurface, and even if the demand for military equality is met, the national economic capacity would never allow it to actively challenge. Therefore, the war crisis between France and Germany is urgent but actually slow to develop. As for an anti-Soviet war, the capitalist countries only intend to impose economic blockades, and while they have a consciousness of restricting the Soviet Union, there are no actual war preparations. Although the Soviet Union loudly proclaims the peace of "We will not attack unless attacked," the main purpose of its first Five-Year Plan and the direction of its second Five-Year Plan are focused on the construction of heavy industry. It is well known to the world that this is for military preparedness, fearing the spread of the "red" disease. However, the signing of the Franco-Soviet non-aggression treaty on November 29 suddenly changed the international situation in Western Europe. Although the antagonism between France and the Soviet Union may not immediately disappear, the general situation has suddenly improved. An anti-Soviet war is unlikely to break out in the short term, especially since Japan and the Soviet Union are both trying to avoid war.</p>
<p>2.  Japan and the United States are Actively Preparing for War</p>
<p>Leaving aside the above two possibilities, what crisis could lead to a world war other than a Japanese-American war?</p>
<p>The possibility of a Japanese-American war has recently become a very common topic. Looking at the newspapers, magazines, and publications in both Japan and the United States, the most widely circulated are those that describe war, especially those that depict a Japanese-American war. Moreover, Japan's label as the "Germany of the East" was not given by the United States. Its warmongering militarism, its desire to dominate East Asia, and its desire to seize the Far Eastern market have been clearly revealed since the Mukden Incident and cannot be concealed. Its military expenditure for the next year's budget has exceeded 820 million yen. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi even believes that spending 1 billion or 2 billion yen annually would be worthwhile. From the American perspective, not only is there a danger of the Eastern market being invaded, but the Philippines and Guam will also fall into enemy hands. Even Hawaii may not be able to escape encirclement by enemy ships, and California may not be spared from air raids.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, both Japan and the United States are promoting active militarism. The two countries harbor jealousy, obstruction, resentment, and amplified malicious propaganda against each other, and are engaged in massive military buildups. Military spies are also everywhere, and the crisis is looming. Although war may not break out immediately, there is no doubt that the fuse is being set. Since the economic crisis has not yet disappeared, and the so-called turning point is only beginning to emerge, future benefits will depend on the Eastern market. The American principle of "Open Door, Equal Opportunity" intends to open the market so that surplus goods can be sold. However, Japan intends to implement a blockade and carry out its monopolistic policy. At this time, there are only two ways to solve the problem: either Japan submits to the Nine-Power Treaty, withdraws its troops from Manchuria, and restores the normal state, or it actively prepares for war and carries out armed aggression, disregarding any international relations and seeking only the benefit of one country. We are well aware that wanting Japan to respect the Nine-Power Treaty and implement the Open Door policy is like "fishing for the moon in the sea" or "climbing a tree to catch fish." There is no other way but to prepare for war.</p>
<p>3.  A New Emphasis on the Pacific Navy</p>
<p>Since the Atlantic Fleet's maneuvers in the Pacific this spring, it should have returned to its original formation after completing the exercises, as usual. However, it has remained in the Pacific, and its return will be delayed until after the spring exercises next year at the earliest. On November 30 of this year, the U.S. Army also recognized the seriousness of the current situation. Although it is in the midst of an economic crisis, it proposed increasing the number of active-duty officers from 12,241 to 14,000, and the number of soldiers from 128,700 to 164,000. Its military equipment will also be completely renewed. The number of increases is indeed very small, and the timing of implementation is also uncertain. However, such preparation does not require a military expert to foresee its dangerous nature. As for the navy, judging from the current military strength, the ratio of the seventeen countries of the United States, Britain, and Japan is nominally the same, but in reality, the American fleet is mostly outdated, with many ships launched before 1914. Destroyers, light cruisers, and submarines are even more obsolete. After another four years, although the number of American destroyers will still be more than double that of Japan, the effective tonnage will probably be less than half of Japan's. The number of light cruisers in the United States is originally 13 fewer than Japan, but the effective tonnage is more than double. As for submarines, the United States has several times more than Japan in terms of quantity, but most of them are old and few are new, and the effective tonnage is only three-quarters of Japan's. If the United States does not build more ships and implement subsidies at this time, it may not have the ability to conduct naval operations after 1936. Moreover, how can an old fleet be competent to travel more than 5,000 nautical miles across the Pacific Ocean? Therefore, if the proposal to reduce military spending by a fraction is rejected by Japan (the Japanese industrial groups have expressed their resolute rejection of this proposal, insisting on maintaining the current state of submarines and destroyers) and there is an intention to increase it, and if the new U.S. President Roosevelt does not relax his advocacy of maintaining the "Open Door" and maintaining "Equal Opportunity," then the naval aspect will demand the early construction of new ships permitted by the London Conference. The spring maneuvers in the Pacific after 1933 will become increasingly impressive, and the start of a new round of military competition will be seen again amid the calls for military reduction.</p>

Recently, reports from various sources indicate that some of the surrendered officers and soldiers and reformed civilians have been colluding with local bullies and gentry, local organs, and stationed troops and militias, committing fraud and killing people arbitrarily. This should be carefully prevented and stopped. A special order was issued to all bandit suppression troops and local organs to treat surrendered bandits generously and should not be neglected in the slightest. Even those who were previously the main culprits harming the local area, if the evidence is clear and conclusive, should be reported to the senior主管organs for consideration and handling and should not be disposed of arbitrarily.</p>

<p>Shantou, [Special] Dispatch of the 4th [Day]. The British-owned Straits Settlements Council in Malaya passed a resolution to increase import taxes, which will be implemented on New Year's Day next year. Chinese merchants in Singapore strongly opposed the increase due to its impact on the sales of domestic goods. In addition, the number of passengers to Singapore is limited to 900 per month. Women and children, as well as second-class passengers, are not included in the limit. The quotas are distributed among the three companies, Dagu, Daxin, and Hetong. Shantou, Xiamen, Haikou, and Hong Kong are allocated only 200 passenger quotas per month. Tickets are priced at 90 yuan, but even at 100 yuan, they are not easy to obtain. Those who are migrating from the northern provinces can obtain passports on postal ships in Shanghai without having to come to Shantou.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Matsuoka Passes Through Moscow　Soviet Telegram <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The relations between the Soviet Union and Japan are sometimes clear and bright, sometimes gloomy, sometimes approaching and friendly, and sometimes deploying troops and generals as if facing a formidable enemy. Although the reporter also lives in the cold and barren red zone, he still cannot see clearly whether their true intention is to join eyebrows and fight it out (?), or to conclude a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty to ease the current tense situation (?).</p>
<p>Logically speaking, Japan is an empire, although it hangs the sign of constitutionalism, it is actually a military dictatorship. Especially in the past year, the military's arrogance has been rampant. Deploying troops to the three northeastern provinces has not only trampled on China's regime in the Northeast with iron hooves, crushed the 30 million people of China, but also trampled on the Soviet Union's rights in northern Manchuria, including the Chinese Eastern Railway. Moreover, the Japanese military has also shattered his parliamentary politics with an iron fist. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union is a dictatorial country ruled by the Communist Party, but it is a country moving towards socialism. Although it may not be able to fully realize its ideals at present, its planned future and its current actions are different from other countries, especially from Japan, which are truly incompatible like ice and charcoal. However, there are also two different views on Japan in the Soviet Union. One is that the current People's Commissar for the Army and Navy, Voroshilov, advocates prudence and first strengthening one's own strength. The commander of the Far Eastern Army, Blucher (i.e., former Galen General who served as an advisor to the National Revolutionary Army), believes that if Japan is too aggressive, it should respond without any tolerance.</p>
<p>After Japan occupied Manchuria, it not only concluded a military alliance with Manchuria but also became one with Manchuria, transforming Manchuria into Japan's vanguard. Japan and Manchuria became the same military unit. At the same time, economically, it also wants to create the so-called Japanese-Manchurian economic alliance. In terms of external significance, whether in military or economic aspects, it contains a deep intention to be hostile to the Soviet Union. Of course, on the other hand, it is also a base for war against the United States. However, what Japan is most uneasy about and also most embarrassing in Manchuria is a long sword inserted into the belly of northern Manchuria, the Chinese Eastern Railway. This railway runs straight through the two provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. Under the current situation, not only does it have close relations with Manchuria, but in terms of Japan's vested interests in Manchuria, it is at least a very large cancer, which is enough to make Manchuria's puppet unstable and enough to fundamentally shake the continental policy of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, Japan, on the one hand, uses diplomatic tactics to hint to Britain and France that Japan is the vanguard of the East standing on the front line of defending against Russia. Japan's seizure of "Manchuria" is for the so-called peace. However, at the same time, he also knows that the League of Nations is a tool of Britain and France. Now that Germany is unruly and Italy is allied with Germany, France's hegemony in Europe is about to be fundamentally shaken. Therefore, France cannot but find ways to maintain the face of the League of Nations. Thus, some restrictions had to be placed on Japan.</p>
<p>In order to maintain what it had gained through aggression and to resist the great powers from interfering in "Manchuria", Japan could not but temporarily try to win over the Soviet Union and use the Soviet Union as its diplomatic tool.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union itself knows very well that its industry is more backward than several strong capitalist countries. To create a socialist country in a capitalist environment, it must go through considerable hard work. Therefore, the implementation of the New Economic Policy and the first and second Five-Year Plans both focus on their own basic work, mechanization and electrification.</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>化││At this time, it will never provoke any trouble with the outside world.</p>
<p>The Japanese military initially did not understand the Soviet Union's intention, so it was quite wary of the Soviet Union's active preparations. Recently, it gradually understood that the Far Eastern Army was "preparing for defense and war."</p>
<h3 id="e62">The End of Traitors <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Zhiyuan Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Zhao Zhongren Detained</p>
<p>According to a certain source, Cheng Zhiyuan, the puppet acting governor of Heilongjiang Province, was originally the commander of the Heilongjiang Garrison. After the Japanese arrived, they were quite suspicious of Cheng. They once transferred Cheng to Changchun to serve as a puppet national military advisor. The position of commander of the Heilongjiang Garrison was given to Zhang Wenzhu. When Su Bingwen's National Salvation Army rose up, the Japanese ordered Cheng to command Zhang's army to attack the National Salvation Army. Although Zhang's army was Cheng's old unit, upon hearing that they were attacking Su, they disobeyed Cheng's orders and the troops could not depart. The Japanese then dismissed their suspicions and reassigned Cheng. At the time, the commander of the Japanese Second Division, Tamon Jirō, detained Cheng in Heihe and then executed him by firing squad. This happened around late last month. Furthermore, Zhao Zhongren, the puppet provincial committee member and finance director of Heilongjiang, was also recently detained by Tamon in Heihe. Originally, the Japanese knew that Zhao was acquainted with Su Bingwen and sent him to Hailar to persuade Su. Zhao obeyed the order and went, but was severely rebuked by Su and returned. The Japanese side blamed him for failing to complete his mission, so they detained him. Zhao was in his forties and the richest man in Heilongjiang. He privately operated a small-scale railway between Ang'angxi and Qiqihar, so his wealth can be imagined. Last year, he introduced Japanese staff officer Itagaki to Ma Zhanshan in Ma's army, acting as an intermediary. It can be seen that he had long decided to be a slave. Although the Japanese utilized such people, they also greatly despised them. Therefore, if these people were no longer beneficial to Japan, they would gradually be eliminated by various means. Cheng and Zhao were probably among them. It is rumored that after Zhao was detained, a portion of his property was confiscated by the Japanese. However, it is still unknown whether his life is in danger.</p>
<p>However, the true intention of the Moscow government is to observe the Far Eastern situation with an attitude of "static observation". Japan took this opportunity to win over the Soviet Union. The past performance of this is that Japan has received considerable gains in both the fishery agreement and the oil agreement.</p>
<p>Politically, in this tense period, what methods did Japan use? Matsuoka Yōsuke, on his way to Geneva, stopped in Moscow on his way through Siberia for a short stay.</p>
<p>He first paid a visit to Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan, then went to see Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov, and then visited Molotov, even going so far as to pay his respects to Stalin, the authority of the Communist Party. And in order to show cordiality, he did not hesitate to participate in the Red Memorial Day (November 7th), which the "Empire" most feared and dreaded. Matsuoka's meeting with the general authorities of the Soviet Union can be roughly divided into the following points:</p>
<p>1.  A non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan must have conditions for exchange. Matsuoka, in the red atmosphere, did not dare to be too explicit, saying that he wanted the Northern Sea fishery, the Siberian forest and mineral resources, and could only describe Japan's intention to be friendly and that Japan and the Soviet Union should mutually understand and jointly maintain the current situation in "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>2.  To inquire whether the Soviet Union is willing to immediately recognize the "Manchukuo (puppet) state" established by Japan.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding the China Eastern Railway, although Japan plans to cut it off, it is ultimately a disease of the abdomen. Matsuoka's intention was to explore whether the Soviet Union could sell the China Eastern Railway to Japan and expressed Japan's willingness to pay a considerable price.</p>
<p>The Soviet authorities' reply was very interesting, saying, "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the Soviet Union has maintained its desire for peace and adhered to neutrality... As for other issues (apart from the non-aggression treaty, which can be discussed), we have not prepared to consider them..."</p>
<p>The smooth and sophisticated Matsuoka encountered such a red "elephant skin nail" in Moscow, and left by train to the west with disappointment (November 20, 1932, in Vladivostok).</p>

<p>Guangdong Deploys Two Wings, Six Squadrons</p>
<p>Guangxi Deploys Three Teams with Eighteen Aircraft</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Guangdong Provincial Air Force Headquarters moved to Shougouling in the eastern suburbs, all aircraft have also been moved there. Recently, due to the continuous addition of fighter planes, it is necessary to have a large number of hangars to store them. The hangars at Dashatou were dismantled and new hangars were built at Shougouling. As for the personnel of each squadron, they have also been engaged in screening recently. A flight technology examination committee was specially formed by the Air Force Headquarters to examine the pilots of each squadron. The first and second squadrons have been examined. Last week, the Air Force Department also sent Lin Fuyuan, the chief of staff of the department, to Shaoguan to personally examine the pilots of the third aircraft squadron stationed in Shaoguan. After the examination of the members of each squadron, they began to reorganize all the pilots. The new reorganization plan was approved by the First Army Group Headquarters on the 25th. On the 26th, the Air Force Department held a meeting to discuss the reorganization and decided to establish the reorganization and the oath of office ceremony for the newly appointed officers next month (December) on the 15th. The new organization includes two large squadrons, each squadron governing three squadrons. The designated squadron leaders are: Tan Shou, the leader of the first squadron; Ding Jixu, the leader of the second squadron; Tao Zuode, the leader of the first squadron; Ma Tinghuai, the leader of the second squadron; Ao Lun, the leader of the third squadron; Xie Mang, the leader of the fourth squadron; Wu Jianwen, the leader of the fifth squadron; and Qiu Wenlin, the leader of the sixth squadron. This is the situation of the recent deployment of the Guangdong aircraft squadron. As for Guangxi Province, Bai Chongxi has also been actively expanding the air force recently. Initially, personnel were borrowed from Guangdong to establish a civil aviation bureau in Guilin to train Guangxi pilots. The flight organization was roughly established. Recently, the purchase of aircraft has been changed to the Aviation Office, which is subordinate to the Fourth Army Group Headquarters. Since then, it has changed from civil to military use. Guangxi Province has purchased a total of eighteen aircraft and compiled them into three aircraft teams, regardless of the name of the large squadron. Each team is equipped with six aircraft, with Lin Weicheng as the director of the Aviation Office. Ning Mingjie, Wu Zihong, and Wu Ruliu serve as the captains of the first, second, and third teams respectively. Xu Shiying is the director of the training class of the Aviation Office. Recently, the Aviation Office was moved to Liuzhou to establish it (November 28th).</p>
<h3 id="e65">Hindenburg Formally Appoints Schleicher Cabinet <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>National Socialist Party and Communist Party Express No Support</p>
<p>Political Circles Hope for a Compromise Solution</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 3rd: New Prime Minister Schleicher has largely determined the distribution of cabinet members. Schleicher will continue to serve concurrently as Minister of Defense, Neurath will continue as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gayl as Minister of Interior, and Schwerin von Krosigk as Minister of Finance. The remaining distributions have also been compromised, but the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Agriculture have not yet been decided. The new cabinet members have been approved by President Hindenburg and have already held their first cabinet meeting. The Reichstag is scheduled to convene on Tuesday and will adjourn after a few days until after Christmas in order to facilitate discussions among the parties on future procedures to obtain greater agreement.</p>
<p>▲ National Socialist, Berlin, 3rd: Tonight, after General Schleicher presented the list of cabinet members, he was formally appointed by the President as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, as well as Administrative Commissioner of Prussia. He also appointed Dr. Bracht, the former acting Administrative Commissioner of Prussia, as Minister of Interior, Baron von Neurath as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Schwerin von Krosigk as Minister of Finance, and Baron von Rüpenach as Minister of Transportation and Post. All three of these departments are held by incumbents. He also appointed Dr. Gürtner as Minister of Justice, Dr. Schlubach, a famous labor insurance scholar, as Minister of Labor, Dr. Gereke as Minister of Unemployment Relief, and Dr. Popitz as Minister without Portfolio and Acting Administrative Commissioner of Prussia. The candidates for Minister of Economy and Minister of Agriculture have not yet been decided. After the new cabinet was formed, all parties turned their attention to what would happen after the Reichstag convened on Tuesday. The Communist Party has officially stated today that it will immediately submit a motion of no confidence in the Schleicher cabinet. The National Socialist Party also issued a formal notice tonight, stating that the Schleicher cabinet cannot meet the needs of the people and cannot be tolerated by the party. However, although these two parties occupy a majority of 295 seats in the 585-seat Reichstag, political circles still hope that a compromise solution can be reached before the opening of the Reichstag to avoid the passage of a vote of no confidence and the re-dissolution of the Reichstag.</p>
<p>▲ National Socialist, Berlin, 3rd: German President Hindenburg sent a letter to outgoing Prime Minister von Papen today, thanking him for his assistance. The wording was very sincere. One section read: "It is only because you firmly and sincerely resigned that I reluctantly granted your request with sorrow. I have always trusted and respected your personality and behavior without diminishing. You have served as Prime Minister and Administrative Commissioner of Prussia for only six months, but your dedication to governance, patriotism, and virtuous character are deeply admired by me. I will never forget the period of our cooperation. I hereby thank you for your achievements in governing the country in the name of the country and myself." Papen also issued a statement today, solemnly stating that the purpose of his past work was only to gather the aspirations of the whole country to see those who value unity and prosperity work together to seek the welfare of the country. Finally, he said, "May we still follow President Hindenburg and work together to create a new Germany."</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Cologne, 3rd: The German labor unions are now warmly supporting General Schleicher's assumption of the position of Prime Minister. Schleicher is known in the labor unions for his independence and fearlessness. The public believes that he will be able to understand the economic difficulties suffered by the labor sector. An employee in the labor unions declared here today that President Hindenburg's appointment of Schleicher to form a cabinet is the best way to resolve the German political crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Situation of the Disarmament Conference <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>British Prime Minister in Busy Talks with Representatives</p>
<p>France Requests New Plan to Be Considered Immediately</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 3rd: British Prime Minister MacDonald was quite busy here today. In the morning, he met with France's Herriot and Paul-Boncour, and in the afternoon, he met with Italian representative Aloisi and American representative Davis. The content of the talks is unknown. It is speculated that this is a preliminary effort to put the Five-Power Conference back on track.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 3rd: The Japanese naval representative who came here for disarmament matters had a long talk with the British naval representative this afternoon. It is heard that Japan's policy is to submit its proposals after the League of Nations Assembly convenes for other countries' naval discussions. The Italian naval representative met with the American representative this afternoon, but there has been no major progress regarding the French-Italian naval agreement.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 3rd: France has decided to continue the work of the Disarmament Conference by all means, so it has repeatedly requested that the disarmament and security construction plan proposed by France be considered immediately. On Monday, Britain, France and other countries will contact Germany. Yesterday, French Prime Minister Herriot first met with British Prime Minister MacDonald. British Foreign Minister Simon and French Minister of War Paul-Boncour were also present. After the meeting, the general impression was as follows: The interruption of the discussion on disarmament problems is the fault of Germany, and France is not responsible in any way. During the suspension of the discussion, the French delegation prepared a complete plan stipulating a military system that all countries can adopt, and detailed the security conditions that are indispensable for disarmament. The so-called principle of equality of armaments has been given a concrete form after such a plan. The purpose of the Disarmament Conference is to make all countries not restricted by the Treaty of Versailles also disarm uniformly. France does not object to this level, but Germany requests that the principle of equality of armaments be the preamble to the Disarmament Conference. France advocates that security should come first, and the principle of equality of armaments should be the conclusion of the Disarmament Conference. That is, the decision of the Disarmament Conference on July 23 this year also advocated this. The plan proposed by France advocates that the Disarmament Conference should promote a system that allows all countries to enjoy equal security. For this reason, it is not only unfair but also contrary to the purpose of the Disarmament Conference to discuss the armament equality issue separately and urgently seek a solution, and to prevent France from demanding security construction as a price. Germany's revision of its armaments is only subject to the recognition of the countries that signed the Treaty of Versailles. It is estimated that Herriot and Paul-Boncour will not be able to abandon this view during the negotiations in Geneva.</p>

<p>Government Opinions Differ</p>
<p>No Final Decision Yet</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 3rd: Last night, Hoover met with Secretary of State Stimson and Treasury Secretary Mills for two hours. The focus of the discussion was on how to respond to the British and French diplomatic notes. Because opinions differed slightly from each other, no formal decision was made. The U.S. government seems to be temporarily keeping silent on the war debt issue to await the results of congressional discussions. It is estimated that this matter will be formally submitted to Congress with a presidential message on Tuesday. It is generally believed that Hoover only asked Congress to organize a committee to study the entire issue, but Hoover firmly believes that his proposal will be accepted by Congress. In order to maintain his usual political principles, Hoover still intends to make suggestions. After meeting with Hoover, Stimson and Mills only said that no formal decision had been taken on the debt issue. The congressional atmosphere was the same as last night. Several senators who had understood the content of the French diplomatic note did not want to express their views separately from the British diplomatic note. These people believed that the spirit of the two diplomatic notes was the same and said that they did not approve of the British diplomatic note. After talking with Hoover, Secretary of State Stimson also had lengthy talks with French Ambassador to the U.S. Claudel and British Ambassador to the U.S. Lindsay.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 3rd: Starving marchers are advancing on Washington again.

There are now 10,000 national defense troops and marines stationed in various camps and strategic locations around the capital, preparing to deter the starving marchers. It is heard that the vanguard has a total of 2,000 people and will arrive here tomorrow (Sunday). Police officers who have requested leave have all been ordered to cancel their leave. 350 firefighters have been ordered to temporarily swear service. Local and municipal groups have all announced that they will not provide food and lodging to the demonstrators.</p>

<p>National Socialist, Pune, 4th: Gandhi, after fasting for the third time for twenty-four hours, obtained a guarantee from the Chief Inspector today that the prisoners' petitions would be thoroughly investigated and improvements would be made if there was suffering. Therefore, he has resumed eating.</p>
<p>▲ National Socialist, Pune, 4th: Gandhi issued a statement saying that his short-term fast was intended to arouse government action, because there was a prisoner named Batevahani who had been protesting the government's refusal to allow him to clean the prison since November 17, and he was about to die.

<p>Reuters, New York, 3rd: The Secretary of the Navy released his annual report, which stated that the U.S. private shipbuilding industry is in a difficult situation due to the almost complete lack of commercial or government work. Also, the current U.S. ship construction program cannot supply the naval strength allowed by the London Naval Treaty, and cannot even implement the replacement of ships that have been in service for too long. The report declares that when the London Naval Treaty expires in 1936, the U.S. naval strength will be far below the limits stipulated by the treaty. Its destroyers, submarines, light cruisers, and aircraft carriers will be especially far behind Japan. Britain will also greatly reduce its strength in these types of warships. The U.S. Navy's estimated expenditure for the 1933 fiscal year is a total of US$459 million, compared to US$358 million in the previous year.</p>

<p>Anglo-Persian Oil Company Opposes Cancellation of Concession</p>
<p>Persian Ministry of Finance Replies That It Cannot Rescind the Order</p>
<p>Reuters, Delhi, 3rd: The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has submitted a reply to the Persian Ministry of Finance regarding the Persian government's cancellation of the concession, stating that the company believes the cancellation is unfair and irregular, and therefore does not accept the cancellation. Persia has recognized this concession both before and after the Constitution, so the Persian government has no right to cancel it. The company cannot accept the government's claim that the concession was established before Persia had a Constitution and is now invalid. The company hopes that the Ministry of Finance will withdraw its letter that harms the company's interests. The Ministry of Finance replied that this is the government's final decision and that the department cannot accept the company's proposal.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Delhi, 3rd: The Persian government has announced the cancellation of the contract between Persia and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company regarding the D'Arcy concession. The Persian Parliament has also passed the cancellation declaration. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has notified the Persian government that it cannot recognize this cancellation as a legal means. The government replied that the cancellation proposal has been decided and cannot be changed. According to the contract, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should pay the Persian government 16% of its annual income, but the company suggested to the Persian government to pay about 300,000 pounds as the payment due for 1931 due to the low price of kerosene in the international market. The Persian side deeply believes that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has not frankly fulfilled the contract. According to the D'Arcy concession, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company obtained it in 1901. Its business began to be well-known in 1905. In 1912, the company paid the Persian government 9,000 pounds. During the European War, although the kerosene mining business did not stop, the company did not pay a penny. It was not until 1920 that it resumed paying. In the following eleven years, the company's profits exceeded 200 million pounds, while the total amount of money received by the Persian government was less than 10 million pounds. Once the above situation was revealed, public opinion was in an uproar. The Persian government intended to set fair terms to protect the interests of the country, so it had to announce the cancellation of the concession contract. For the company, it would be better to correct the above unfair situation in order to eliminate misunderstandings and treat the Persian government with sincerity.</p>

<p>National Salvation Army Breaks Through Encirclement on the Jihai Railway</p>
<p>Fu, Zhao, Luo, and Other Units Counterattack After Reinforcements</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The most vigorous anti-Japanese and traitor-suppression efforts in Jilin Province are being carried out by the Northeast National Salvation Army's 7th Detachment Commander Fu Dianchen, 8th Detachment Commander Zhao Furui (currently represented by Chief of Staff Ma Junshan), and 19th Detachment Commander Luo Mingxing. They attacked Changchun and raided Jilin, shaking the puppet capital. The Jichang and Jihai Railways have been repeatedly destroyed, preventing traffic for a long time. The Japanese and puppet armies fear and hate them deeply. Recently, they launched a large-scale encirclement of Fu, Zhao, Luo, and other units with more than two divisions of troops, Zhang Haipeng's traitorous forces, dozens of aircraft, tanks, artillery, and other new weapons. A fierce battle shook the world. The report on the battle is urgently recorded below:</p>
<p>According to a high-level intelligence report on November 14th at 9:00 AM, Fu Dianchen, commander of the Northeast National Salvation Army's Independent 7th Detachment, learned that Lieutenant General Shaochuan, the puppet commander-in-chief (stationed in Sipingjie), was advancing with four divisions (Japanese soldiers) and 100,000 cavalry from the traitorous army of Zhang Haipeng, attacking the volunteer armies on various railway lines. They attached great importance to the Jichang and Jihai Railways and decided to deploy two divisions of Japanese soldiers and six cavalry brigades of the traitorous army. The advance force, consisting of two cavalry brigades and two Japanese infantry regiments (approximately equivalent to two Chinese mixed regiments), was rushing to the areas occupied by our detachment. After receiving the report, Commander Fu immediately convened a meeting of senior officers. It was generally agreed that after years of hard fighting, our army had been able to win more with less due to guerrilla tactics. However, during this snowy and icy season, the soldiers lacked winter clothing and shoes, and the ammunition reserves were running low and difficult to replenish once used up. Moreover, the Japanese and puppet forces were pressing with heavy troops, and their momentum was fierce. Therefore, it would be better to retreat to preserve strength. It was decided to abandon unimportant areas, shorten the defensive lines, and concentrate forces to break through the Japanese and puppet encirclement and advance to the 囗囗 Mountains to rest and reorganize, waiting for reinforcements before launching a large-scale offensive. Commander Fu immediately ordered the 1st Division Commander Liu Jingchun to lead his troops to cover the retreat (because the division commander was brave and calm in battle, had effective measures, sufficient ammunition, strong soldiers and horses, and the soldiers were mostly local people familiar with the mountain paths). The 1st Division Commander Lin Guiyi led his entire force to serve as the vanguard (the officers and soldiers of this division were mostly Shandong and Lu heroes, brave and good at fighting). The 3rd Division Commander Wang Haishan led his troops to contain the flanks of the Japanese and puppet forces in Shuanghezhen, Pihezi, and other places to facilitate the retreat of our 1st and 2nd Divisions. After the various arrangements were made, Commander Fu led the guard regiment, the entire staff of the headquarters, and important supplies such as provisions, and first retreated from Chaluhe to Badaohe Street to await the assembly of the various divisions. That night, a snowstorm raged, and the exhaled breath turned to ice. The mournful wind howled, causing shivers. The soldiers lacked winter clothing, and the situation was very miserable. However, thinking of the strong enemy ahead, they stood guard with their weapons, their morale soaring a hundredfold, shouting and neighing, awaiting the start of a great battle. On the morning of the 15th, at 2:00 AM, according to reports from various scouts, the Japanese and puppet forces had completed their deployment and were preparing to launch a siege at dawn. The 2nd Division immediately ordered mobilization and launched an attack south of the Jihai Railway. The Japanese and puppet armies fired rifles, machine guns, and artillery simultaneously, the rumbling sound deafening. The fierce artillery fire was beyond description. Our army advanced while maneuvering, fighting as they went. At dawn, they broke through the encirclement, which was completely unexpected by the Japanese and puppet forces, so they continued to pursue and bombard. At around 8:00 AM, our army retreated into the mountains. The 1st Division covered the retreat, setting up defenses on each mountain ridge they occupied. By 9:00 AM, our army had penetrated deep into the mountains. Many of the Japanese and puppet soldiers had become sick from the cold, and they were ambushed by our forces, so they stopped pursuing. Our army was preparing to rest and reorganize the team when Japanese aircraft suddenly arrived, bombing in groups of three. Our army quickly dispersed and took cover. The Japanese planes initially flew low, and we fired rockets at them. Although they did not hit, the Japanese planes were very afraid and dared not fly low. Our army saw that the trees were uprooted and the mountain rocks were shattered where the bombs landed. However, because of avoiding the planes, they stopped advancing. The Japanese and puppet armies attacked again, and the fighting continued until the afternoon of the 16th, when they finally gathered in the planned safe area. In this battle, our officers and soldiers suffered slight casualties, and the ammunition became even more scarce due to two days and one night of fierce fighting. They have now retreated into the 囗囗 Mountains to await supplies and reinforcements.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, at 10:00 AM, the 8th Detachment received intelligence that the Japanese and puppet forces were launching a large-scale encirclement of the 7th Detachment on the Jihai Railway. Chief of Staff Ma Junshan convened a meeting and decided that they could not support the 7th Detachment. They decided to destroy the Jichang Railway and attack the flanks of the Japanese and puppet forces to facilitate the withdrawal of the 7th Detachment. Chief of Staff Ma then directed the 1st Division Commander Wang Hailou and the 2nd Division Commander Zhu Pengji to lead their entire forces to Botuohezi, Duanjiatun, Erdaogou, and other places, together with the 19th Detachment of Luo Mingxing (nicknamed "Three Rivers Hero"), to coordinate their actions. On the night of the 19th, they occupied the Xiajiutai Railway Station (which the puppet government recently planned to rename Jiutai County) and captured the streets, killing more than 400 Japanese and puppet soldiers, seizing more than 700 firearms, capturing more than 1,100 puppet soldiers, and acquiring a large amount of military supplies. At noon on the 20th, the Japanese and puppet forces received reinforcements from nearby and launched a counterattack against our army. Our army withdrew from the streets and occupied positions at the railway station, fighting while simultaneously selecting two special task forces. One team was sent to Yinmahe to destroy bridges, and the other team captured Huapichang Railway Station. The Japanese and puppet forces were attacked from both sides and collapsed on the afternoon of the 21st. Our army returned fully loaded and then went to the border of Shanghegou, Demaxian to concentrate. They are now joining forces with Wang Delin's army at 囗囗 on the Songhua River to await supplies and reinforcements (December 囗 day).</p>
<h3 id="e79">Reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Fang Shengtao and Chen Peikun Have Left Fujian for Shanghai</p>
<p>Jiang Guangnai's Return to the Province to Take Office Is Undetermined</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government has been approved by the 78th meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 29th of last month. The current provincial government and the four departments of civil affairs, finance, education, and construction are all preparing to close down to await the transfer of power. Chairman Fang Shengtao took his family and left for Shanghai on the Huaan steamer on the morning of the 30th of last month, along with Provincial Government Member Chen Peikun and former 4th Brigade Commander of the Provincial Defense Army Huang 囗 Wu. The affairs of the provincial government are being handled by Liu Tong, the Director of Civil Affairs. The new Chairman Jiang Guangnai returned to the province from Yanping on the evening of the 30th, intending to hold a discussion meeting after the new provincial committee members have all arrived to decide on the organizational methods of the provincial government and various departments before officially taking office on a scheduled date. Only Lin Zhiyuan and Li Zhangda are in the province, and Fan Qiwu and Lu Wenlan are in Zhangzhou. The remaining Sun Xiwena, Gao Dengxian, and Zheng Zhenwen are still in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, so they will not be able to arrive for at least two weeks. However, the general civil servants are very panicked because their salaries are almost half a year in arrears and the new provincial government will not recognize them after the reorganization. It is also rumored that Jiang Guangnai's trip to Yanping will resolve the issues of a certain department, making the atmosphere in the provincial capital quite tense. In fact, this is completely inaccurate. Jiang's trip was to delineate the defense areas of the various military units in northern Fujian. It is reported that the 19th Route Army (currently concentrated in northern Fujian with about three brigades under the command of Zhang Yan, Deputy Commander of the 60th Division, stationed in Yanping, Jian'ou, Shunchang, and Jiangle counties; the 56th Division of Liu Heding stationed in Shaowu, Jianyang, Jianning, and Tai'ning counties; the 21st Division of Liu Zhennian stationed in Pucheng, Songxi, Zhenghe, and Shouning counties; the newly organized 1st Division of Lu Xingbang stationed in Yong'an, Youxi, Shaxian, and Datian counties; the 3rd Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army of Qian Yuguang (formerly the 4th Brigade, now merged with the 3rd Brigade of Chen Wei远) and the 4th Independent Brigade of Zhou Ziqun are stationed in Guangze. It is heard that the newly appointed Pacification Commissioner for Fujian, Cai Tingkai, will also come to the province in the coming days to discuss with Jiang Guangnai the methods for reorganizing the Fujian situation (December 1st).</p>
<h3 id="e80">Internal Reform of the "People's Defense Force" Plan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>To be Renamed "People's Defense Corps" and Adopt Conscription</p>
<p>A Proposal Has Been Drafted and Submitted to the Internal Affairs Conference for Discussion</p>
<p>The Second National Internal Affairs Conference convened by the Ministry of Interior is scheduled to open in Nanjing on the 10th of this month. The Ministry of Interior believes that this conference will have in-depth discussions on various matters that should be undertaken and reformed, which is greatly related to the future of China's internal affairs. It has drafted a number of important proposals to be submitted to the conference for discussion. It is reported that one of the proposed proposals is to reform the county "Defense Corps," the main purpose of which is to change the current county "Defense Corps" in various provinces into "People's Defense Corps" and adopt a conscription system. The original proposal describes the reasons for the reform and the methods in detail. The methods are recorded as follows: (1) The "Defense Corps" is renamed "People's Defense Corps." (2) The "People's Defense Corps" adopts a conscription system, and hiring substitutes is not allowed. (3) All male citizens of the Republic of China who are between the ages of 20 and 40 are obligated to be incorporated into the "People's Defense Corps" to receive training and serve. (4) The "People's Defense Corps" is divided into four types: active duty corps, reserve corps, first reserve corps, and second reserve corps. (5) The term of active duty is nine months, with the first six months spent in training and the last three months responsible for training the first reserve corps. Upon completion of the term, they are transferred to the reserve corps, which lasts for 囗 years and three months. Upon completion of the term, they are transferred to the second reserve corps. Those who have not been incorporated into the active duty corps are all incorporated into the first reserve corps. Both the first reserve corps and the second reserve corps will continue until they reach the age of service. (6) The active duty corps should be recruited from able-bodied men aged 20 to 24. If the number of people is too large, it will be determined by lot. (7) Those who have one of the following circumstances may be exempted from the obligation to be incorporated into the "People's Defense Corps": (1) those who are disabled or deformed; (2) those who are mentally unsound; (3) those who have no other able-bodied males in the family and whose conscription would make it impossible to maintain their family's livelihood and have reliable proof. (8) Graduates of secondary schools or above who have completed military science courses and have certificates may be directly incorporated into the reserve corps. (9) Those who have one of the following circumstances may postpone their conscription: (1) those who are currently serving in local public office; (2) those who are studying at school; (3) those who are ill or unable to perform labor after illness; (4) those who are being investigated or tried for crimes punishable by penal servitude or more severe; (5) those who have been convicted of crimes and are serving sentences of penal servitude; (6) those who have been released on parole. If the above circumstances have not ended by the time the active duty corps reaches the age of conscription, they will be directly incorporated into the first reserve corps. (10) Although the term of service in the "People's Defense Corps" has expired, it may be extended by order in the event of extraordinary events or special circumstances. (11) The organization of the "People's Defense Corps" is as follows: (1) The province establishes a provincial defense committee under the provincial government to manage the defense affairs of the entire province. The chairman and vice-chairman are concurrently held by the provincial chairman and the director of civil affairs, respectively. (2) The province is divided into several districts, and each district establishes a district defense headquarters to supervise the defense affairs of the district. The district defense commander is appointed by the provincial government upon the recommendation of the provincial defense committee. (3) The county establishes a county defense headquarters to handle the defense affairs of the entire county. The commander is concurrently held by the county magistrate, and the deputy commander is appointed by the provincial defense committee upon the recommendation of the district commander. (12) The district and county defense headquarters shall establish a political training director, a political instructor, and several trainers to be responsible for political training. (13) The county defense headquarters may establish a conscription committee, and each district under the county may establish a branch to be responsible for investigating and compiling the roster of able-bodied men in the county or district, reporting it on a regular basis, and conscripting and convening the "Defense Corps." (14) The active duty corps is organized with ten men as a squad, three squads as a platoon, three platoons as a company, and three or five companies as a battalion. Each county may organize several companies into several battalions depending on the circumstances, and they are led by the county commander and deputy commander. The organization of the reserve corps and the reserve corps is the same as the active duty corps. (15) One-half of the active duty corps retires every half year (four and a half months), and one-half is conscripted to replenish it. (16) The active duty corps is responsible for assisting the military police in pacifying the local area and is generally confined to the county. However, they may carry out their duties in various counties within the defense district upon the order of the district commander. (17) The reserve corps and the reserve corps usually live at home and engage in their occupations, responsible for clearing the countryside. In the event of extraordinary events, they should immediately assemble to respond. (18) In the event of extraordinary events in the country or local area, in addition to dispatching the active duty corps, the reserve corps and the reserve corps may be convened by order. (19) The training of the "People's Defense Corps" is divided into military training and political training, and the subjects are formulated by the provincial defense committee. The "People's Defense Corps" should hold inspections at appropriate times, and the methods are determined by the provincial defense committee. (20) The reserve corps trains for a certain number of days each year. The first reserve corps trains for three months each year for the first three years (12 hours per week). From the fourth year onwards, it is inspected once a year. The second reserve corps is inspected once a year. (21) The flag, clothing, and symbols of the "People's Defense Corps" are formulated by the Ministry of Interior and promulgated. (22) The firearms of the active duty corps are allocated from the existing public guns and corps guns. If they are insufficient, they are purchased and supplemented with local public funds. The firearms of the reserve corps and the reserve corps are requisitioned from all civilian guns during training or wartime, but they are returned to the owners in peacetime. (23) The expenses of the "Defense Corps" in each province are centrally allocated by the provincial government. (24) The budgets of the "Defense Corps" at all levels should be stipulated by the provincial government, and their final accounts should be reported to the provincial government for verification and cancellation on a regular basis. (25) If a member of the active duty corps commits a crime punishable by penal servitude or escapes privately during the term of service, the term of imprisonment or the number of days of escape shall not be counted in the term of service. (26) The "People's Defense Corps" system may be implemented in phases and districts in each province depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Telegraph Request to the Provincial Government</p>
<p>To Exempt from Levying Borrowed Grain</p>
<p>The provincial government instructed this county to continue to levy two yuan of "borrowed grain" when collecting the second installment of land tax to offset the needs of suppressing bandits and providing sufficient funds. Now, the various industries in this county are experiencing a decline in rice prices, and rents have decreased by one-third compared to last year, causing extreme economic hardship for the people. Therefore, Li Zuhua, Cai Zhongyu, and Wu Qianmei, the director and deputy directors of the Public Funds and Property Management Office, telegraphed to the Director of Finance of the Provincial Government and Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, stating: "We have investigated that last year, an additional two yuan of grain silver was levied for each stone of grain, and the people appealed to be exempted from the levy because the burden was too heavy. We were fortunate to receive your order that the additional two yuan of grain for this year's commutation of grain tax was for military expenses to suppress bandits and could not be offset. We presented a request for approval to extend the additional levy for one year. We admire your concern for the people's livelihood and your provisional measures, which have been restricted. The people are also mindful of the provincial treasury's deficit, so they have to reluctantly contribute to fulfill their obligations, as the additional grain levy is not long-lasting. However, although last year's harvest was not abundant, the rice price was not low, so they could still bear the pain and pay. This year, the rice price has fallen sharply, and the farmers' rental income is less than two-thirds of last year's. The people's suffering is even greater than before, and the second installment of land tax is being levied, with an additional two yuan of grain being levied continuously. Our officials have been entrusted by the local elders and dare not remain silent. We telegraph to request exemption from the additional levy of two yuan of 'borrowed grain' per stone this year to alleviate the people's hardship."</p>

<p>Organizing Deteriorated Silk</p>
<p>Application for Extension</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Wuxi Silk Factory Guild held its 20th temporary membership meeting at the Xujia Alley Guild Hall. Representatives from 17 factories, including Yongtai, and 15 people, including Xue Shouhuan, attended. Qian Fengting, the chairman, discussed the following matters: (1) Reporting the letter from the Jiangzhe Deteriorated Silk and Cocoons Organization Committee instructing the factories that have registered their deteriorated silk and cocoons to affix the registration seal to the original notification letter issued by the organization committee and submit it to the guild for compilation and remittance to serve as proof for issuing registration forms to clarify the number of households that have already received forms. It has been found that the deadline for subsidizing deteriorated silk and cocoons at the end of December is approaching rapidly, and only 9,540 bales of silk have been exported to date. More than 17,000 loads of silk that have been registered and stamped have not been exported. The Organizing Committee is currently trying to request an extension, but the procedures are very complicated, and it is still unknown whether the government will approve it. All factories are requested to submit the registration forms as soon as possible and not delay any longer. As for the subsidies, it was originally planned to issue treasury bonds, but now it has been changed to public debt. If you have any opinions, please express them. It was resolved that factories that have not yet filled out the registration forms should submit them to the guild as soon as possible for compilation and remittance, and that the deteriorated silk that has already been produced must be exported by the deadline.</p>

<p>Yuan Xiluo of the Jiangsu Provincial Defense Committee recently set out from Zhenjiang to inspect the defense corps of the four counties of Wuxi, Jiangyin, Yixing, and Jinshan in preparation for implementing political training for the defense corps in all counties of the province. He arrived in Wuxi at around 6:00 PM. A reporter drove to visit him, and Mr. Yuan told him that the defense corps is a preparation for basic military force, but recently the people have paid little attention to it. After the Japanese bandits invaded Shanghai last winter, the elders and insightful people of Jiangsu Province initiated the organization of the Jiangsu Defense Committee. Currently, the two counties of Qidong and Chongming are doing the best in Jiangsu Province's defense corps. As for the Provincial Defense Committee, Nanyang in Henan Province and Zhengping in Shandong Province are the most complete and spirited defense corps in the country. Therefore, it is planned to send personnel to visit and investigate the above two places in the short term. I am currently planning to go to Jiangyin for inspection first, stay for about two or three days, and then come to Wuxi for inspection, he said.</p>

<p>Zhexi Seawall</p>
<p>Construction Completed</p>
<p>The seawall project along the Qiantang River estuary in Western Zhejiang is a massive undertaking with a long history, a great architectural feat of the old era. Due to years of disrepair, in the autumns of the 19th and 20th years of the Republic, continuous wind and rain and sudden tides threatened the embankments of the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th forts of Hai'ning County. The Construction Department ordered the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau to carry out emergency repairs. Afterwards, the dangerous sections of each fort were selected and rebuilt using new seawall construction methods. However, the cost was quite high, and the dangerous seawalls of Western Zhejiang are not only related to the three old prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in Western Zhejiang, but also the lives and properties of the people of the Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, and Taicang prefectures of Jiangsu Province depend entirely on this seawall for protection. Therefore, a request was submitted to the National Government to allocate funds for major repairs. After approval by the Executive Yuan, 2 million yuan in disaster relief bonds were allocated, but these bonds could not be mortgaged because they had not been issued. The Zhejiang Provincial Government could not delay the demolition and construction of the seawall, so it raised funds separately and selected important sections for construction. Since the start of construction, the most dangerous sections of the Ming, Pan, Yi, Mi, Yu, Ji, Po, Mu, Qin, Bing, Yue, Zong, and other characters have been demolished and completed, requiring a total of 250,000 yuan in construction funds. Yesterday (the 3rd), a completion ceremony was held at the temporary construction site of the dangerous seawall section of the Hanghai section of the Pan Ming character. The Construction Department invited representatives from all walks of life to visit in advance. Zeng Yangfu, the Director of the Construction Department, Zhang Zili, the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, Du Zhenhuan, the Director of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau, Xiao Aishi, a foreign expert of the Provincial Government, Fang Qingru, the representative of the Provincial Party Department, and 40 other people departed from Hangzhou by car at 8:00 AM, inspected from the 11th Fort to Wangba Fort along the way, and took a group photo before holding the completion ceremony. It is reported that the demolition and construction of the most dangerous seawalls was carried out with great frugality, costing a total of 250,000 yuan. If all the seawalls are completely repaired, it will cost an estimated 1.6 million yuan. If the original plan can be fully implemented, the lives and properties of the people of the three prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in Western Zhejiang and the prefectures of Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, and Taicang in Jiangsu Province will be fully guaranteed in the future.

<p>Grain and Wheat Surtax</p>
<p>Cease Collection</p>
<p>Anhui Province issued hundreds of thousands of road construction bonds due to the importance of road construction and designated the grain surtax as the road construction bond fund. However, the natives of the capital, Shanghai, and Anhui strongly opposed it. The provincial government, fearing that it would affect the road debt, strongly advocated caution. On the 2nd, at the 308th regular meeting of the provincial government, Chairman Wu Zhongxin proposed a proposal to exempt all grain export surtaxes, stating that the grain export surtax case in this province has been designated as a special fund for road construction, but recently the rice price has plummeted, and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. In order to provide relief, it is proposed to exempt all grain export surtaxes in this province, and the road construction funds will be submitted to the central government for separate arrangements. It was resolved that all grain surtaxes in the province should be stopped.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Support Association Remits Funds to Encourage Volunteer Army <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Fierce Battle Begins in Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>Survival of the Northeast at Stake</p>
<p>Telegraph Request to Incite a Pincer Attack</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association believes that the Japanese 5th Division is launching a large-scale attack to oppress the volunteer army and that a fierce battle has already begun. Yesterday, they telegraphed Li Du, Ding Chao, Wang Delin, and others separately and remitted funds to provide assistance, requesting that they encourage the entire army to bravely kill the enemy. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>Telegraph to Li Du, Ding Chao: To Chairman Ding Jiechen of Jilin, Commander Li Zhichu, Xun Jian, the 8,000 yuan of assistance funds remitted by Mr. Wang Ziyao from the previous time has been received. Since Commander Su Hanzhang swore an oath to resist Japan in Northern Manchuria, the situation has changed, international sympathy has been gained, and the stubborn enemy has become angry and is now driving five divisions of Japanese troops to oppress us on a large scale. A fierce battle has already begun. Although the Su and Ma armies have natural barriers to rely on, they have no confidence in winning. We request that the volunteer armies of Jilin Province incite and launch a pincer attack in various directions. The opportunity is difficult to repeat. Our association has already telegraphed Commander Feng Shoushan (Zhan Hai) to mobilize and advance eastward. Now, in accordance with the previous method, we are remitting 10,000 yuan of assistance funds, hoping to encourage the three armies to advance and kill the enemy. The future of the Northeast truly depends on this. This telegram is sent with the hope of receiving good news. Jointly sent by the Standing Directors of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Yin Zhufu, Wu Shan, Feng Shaoshan, Yu Huancheng, Yan Zhifang.</p>
<p>Telegram to Wang Delin: To Commander Wang Delin of Dongning, Xun Jian, the 5,000 yuan of assistance funds remitted by Mr. Liang Detang from the previous time has been received. Recently, the enemy has been pressing with all its strength, and the war in Northern Manchuria between Su and Ma is tense. 囗囗 enemy troops 囗囗 we request that elite troops be selected 囗 take 囗囗 to attack the enemy's rear. In addition to telegraphing Li Zhichu (Du), Ding Jiechen (Chao), and Feng Shoushan (Zhan Hai) to incite a unified action, we are now allocating another 5,000 yuan in assistance funds to your unit and remitting it to Mr. Liang for forwarding. We hope that you will encourage the entire army to bravely kill the enemy. This telegram is sent with the hope of receiving good news. Jointly sent by the Standing Directors of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Yin Zhufu, Wu Shan, Feng Shaoshan, Yu Huancheng, Yan Zhifang.</p>
<p>All China National Salvation United Association</p>
<p>Invites Liu Piguang to Report</p>
<h3 id="e88">Conditions of Resistance Against Japan in Jilin and Heilongjiang <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The China Eastern News Agency reports that the Joint Federation of National Salvation Organizations from all sectors of the country invited Mr. Liu Piguang, the representative of Ding Chao and Li Du from the Joint Communication Office in Shanghai of the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Armies, to report on the recent combat situation of the Northeastern Volunteer Army at the federation's meeting yesterday (the 4th) afternoon. The attendees included council members of the federation Zhang Jun'guang, Tu Liang, Dong Mosheng, Zuo Hua, Xie Nai'shi, Chen Zhenquan, Ma Zhiying, etc. The meeting commenced at 2:30 PM. After Chairman Zhang Jun'guang delivered a speech, Mr. Liu began his report, saying: "I am very grateful for the invitation to report to you today. I originally planned to discuss things in detail, but I have been ill these past few days, so I can only give a simple and unordered report on the recent situation in Jilin and Heilongjiang. I apologize deeply."</p>
<p>▲ Regarding Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>You all know very well the past situation of anti-Japanese warfare in Heilongjiang Province. I will only talk about the recent situation. Recently, the northwestern part of Heilongjiang is completely occupied by Su Bingwen's troops, and the northeastern part is occupied by Ma Zhanshan's troops. Su Bingwen's revolt was carefully planned and prepared in advance, so his strength has been very powerful since the uprising. Therefore, the Japanese have also concentrated all their forces to suppress Su's army. However, Su's army has not succumbed. Since merging with Ma Zhanshan's troops, their resistance has become even greater. The total strength of Su and Ma is now about 100,000, with 50,000 to 60,000 concentrated in the Greater Khingan Range. The west of the Greater Khingan Range is completely under Su's influence, and the southeast is under Ma's influence. The Japanese forces are only in the Qiqihar, Hailun, and Harbin areas, along the railway line. Recently, because the Heilongjiang army is concentrated in the Greater Khingan Range, the Japanese army has also concentrated there, so the decisive battle in the future will be in the Greater Khingan Range, and the victory or defeat will also be in the Greater Khingan Range.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding Jilin Province</p>
<p>In Jilin Province, the area around the Mudan River and east of the Songhua River, west of the Russian Primorsky Krai, is completely under the influence of Ding and Li. There have been no major battles there recently. Only more than ten days ago, the Yilan line in the lower reaches of the Songhua River was completely recaptured by Li Du, so the lost territory along the Songhua River has been restored. The current battle plan is to disrupt the Japanese rear from Yilan to Harbin. The Japanese have already become fearful of this, so they have also concentrated heavy troops in Harbin. As for Wang Delin, he is fully cooperating with Ding and Li. After Wang Delin's troops destroyed the construction of the Jihui Line, it can be said to be a great strategic success, making it impossible for the Japanese to complete their military communication line. Wang's current strength is about 50,000, and Ding and Li's strength is about 80,000.</p>
<p>▲ Recent Situation of the Volunteer Army in Jilin and Heilongjiang</p>
<p>About twenty counties in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces have not been taken away. The postal service of the Republic of China still operates normally there, and the Blue Sky White Sun flag is flying everywhere. It is truly heartbreaking that only this small piece of clean land remains in thousands of miles of beautiful rivers and mountains. The Jilin and Heilongjiang armies are currently experiencing extreme difficulties in terms of supplies and military needs. Last year was relatively manageable, but this year it is simply unimaginable because the army has grown in the past year, so the needs have naturally increased. There were no unlined or single-layered garments this spring and summer, so the soldiers had to remove the cotton wadding from their cotton clothes. Now that winter has arrived, and there is no more cotton wadding to wrap around their bodies. Although some units have requisitioned quilts from the people to make cotton clothes, the number of quilts is limited, which is not enough to keep the soldiers warm. Therefore, most soldiers are still wearing single-layered or unlined clothes and fighting the enemy in the frozen wilderness. Most of the food is taken from the people. Unfortunately, there was a flood in the Songhua River area this year, and the autumn harvest is hopeless, so there is also great concern about food. As for the lack of guns and ammunition, it is even more obvious.</p>
<p>▲ Tactics of the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The Japanese army completely uses battle lines to suppress the Volunteer Army, but this is not important. The Volunteer Army can use guerrilla tactics to deal with them, making it impossible for them to cope. Moreover, the Volunteer Army's shooting is very accurate, and one bullet can always take down an enemy. However, the Japanese army's artillery, airplanes, and bombs are something that the Volunteer Army cannot deal with, because the Volunteer Army does not have such sophisticated weapons. Therefore, the Japanese can only use artillery and bombs to bombard the Volunteer Army during the day. The Volunteer Army can only attack at night. At present, the Japanese forces rely entirely on important cities along the South Manchurian, Beining, Tao'ang, and Chinese Eastern Railways. Otherwise, there are no traces of them. As for the Volunteer Army, they appear and disappear everywhere, using guerrilla tactics to make it difficult for the Japanese army to cope. Although the Volunteer Army has the strength to recapture important cities, it is difficult to defend them after recapture due to the lack of guns and ammunition. In order to avoid major losses, it is better not to recapture them for the time being. If the national government can provide effective assistance, then it will not be difficult to recover the Eastern Provinces.</p>
<p>▲ Failure of Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>The Japanese imperialists' occupation of our Eastern Provinces was originally intended to alleviate their own crisis through economic aggression in the Three Northeastern Provinces. However, since the occupation of the Three Northeastern Provinces by the Japanese for a year and the establishment of a puppet government, the resistance and disruption of the Volunteer Army have caused complete chaos in the Three Northeastern Provinces. Commerce is depressed, and the economy is bankrupt. The Japanese economic aggression in the Northeast cannot be successfully completed. Therefore, it goes without saying that the Volunteer Army can persist in fighting the Japanese, and the economic aggression of Japanese imperialism has failed. At the same time, Japan's immigration policy has also completely failed. Although they have worked hard to carry out their so-called armed immigration since September 18, these immigrants are constantly subjected to the oppression of the Volunteer Army. Now, the past immigrants have all fled or committed suicide due to economic bankruptcy, and it is of course even more difficult for new immigrants to gain a foothold. Therefore, since September 18, Japan's immigration policy has also completely failed.</p>
<p>▲ Atrocities of the Japanese Army in the Northeast</p>
<p>The Japanese army arbitrarily kills our people. After September 18 last year, the frontline soldiers who returned from the battle at the Nenjiang Bridge all saw with their own eyes the Japanese capturing Chinese people one by one, hanging them upside down on the bridge, and slowly stabbing them to death with knives. As for Chinese people being buried alive in various places, it is even more commonplace. The method of burying alive is to have the person being buried dig a mud cave himself, crawl into the cave himself, and cover it with mud himself. Finally, the Japanese completely bury the person with mud. Sometimes they also arbitrarily arrest a Chinese person, accuse him of being suspicious, and beat him severely with leather whips, even pouring kerosene and chili water into his nostrils and mouth. In important cities, there is a health inspection or household survey every few days. During the survey, the Japanese arbitrarily break into people's homes, arbitrarily beat men, and rape women. Especially those female students are insulted beyond description. The suffering of our people under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism is no different from that of slaves of a conquered nation.</p>
<p>▲ Efforts That the Chinese People Should Make</p>
<p>The loss of the Three Northeastern Provinces is originally a very painful matter. Although the Volunteer Army's fighting against Japan is not strong, the blow it has given to Japan is already very deep. It can be seen that the only way to avenge the national humiliation is through force. However, the strength of the Volunteer Army is very weak, and it is difficult to win without the assistance of the people of the whole country. Therefore, in this time of national crisis, all Chinese people should do their best to help the Volunteer Army, both spiritually and materially. Only through such continuous efforts can we put the enemy to death, wash away the national shame, and recover the lost territory. As for donations and assistance from all sectors, it is best to remit them directly to that side, not only is telegraphic transfer still available there, but it also avoids many troubles. This is also something that I am specifically mentioning to you today in my report. Although there is a lot more to say, I have to end here due to time constraints and my illness. After Mr. Liu finished his report, everyone dispersed after receiving refreshments.</p>

<p>In the fourth year of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Kuomintang, was indignant at Yuan Shikai's brewing of an imperial system and launched a campaign to overthrow him. He sent Mr. Chen Qimei to take the opportunity to start an uprising in Shanghai. He died on this day seventeen years ago. Yang Hu and others seized the Shaohua warship to launch an uprising to overthrow Yuan, and all transportation agencies were also occupied. Later, due to being outnumbered, it failed.

<p>Hubei Bandits and Jiangxi Bandits Can Be Expected to Be Suppressed</p>
<p>Guizhou War and Sichuan War to Be Handled Separately</p>
<p>Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin came to Shanghai the day before yesterday for medical treatment due to illness. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. He at his residence yesterday to inquire about the situation of bandit suppression and matters in Guizhou and Sichuan. Mr. He graciously received him and answered in detail. The following is a separate record:</p>
<p>Situation of Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>According to Minister He, the bandits in Hubei have been largely dispersed after being severely suppressed by the National Army. At present, only a few small groups remain, such as the Xu bandits who are fleeing westward towards the Shaanxi border. Yang Hucheng has sent troops to intercept them, and they will soon be completely suppressed. There are currently still 20,000 communist bandits in Jiangxi. Recently, they attempted to flee to eastern Jiangxi, planning to first occupy Fuzhou and then attack Xuguigui, Yiyang, and other places. The National Army has detected this and is intercepting them fiercely. They have now fled towards the border of Jiangxi and Fujian, to Lichuan, Jianning, and Taining. The National Army has also advanced from Fuzhou to Huwan to pursue them. The military affairs of bandit suppression in Jiangxi Province are being directed by me remotely from Beijing. Recently, General Chen Cheng has been appointed as the commander of the forward troops advancing on Fuzhou. Commander Chiang will go to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression of bandits as soon as the Third Plenary Session is over. It is expected that they will be completely suppressed in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Internal Strife in Guizhou and Sichuan <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Guizhou, I previously received a telegram from You Guocai stating that You's troops have already occupied Guiyang, and Wang Jialie's troops have retreated towards western Guizhou. However, I have not yet received a report from Wang Jialie. According to another source, He Zizhong's division of Wang Jialie's troops was originally stationed on the border of Guizhou and Hunan. Wang has now telegraphed He's division to rush to aid. You Guocai intends to intercept He's division midway to eliminate Wang's strength. As for the truth, it is still unclear. The Central Government must wait until the truth is ascertained before making a decision on how to deal with it. It has already been decided to reorganize the Sichuan government based on the order of the 17th year of the Republic of China. However, the Central Government has not yet decided whether to establish a reorganization committee.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Third Plenary Session <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Third Plenary Session is a regular meeting held once a year. This session is scheduled to open in Beijing on the 15th. I will of course attend, but there are no proposals circulating. I have not heard of the rumors that this meeting will discuss raising the chairman's authority and increasing the number of standing committee members of the Central Political Council.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Returning to Beijing Today <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>I came to Shanghai this time for medical treatment and have no other tasks. Last Friday, I suddenly had a fever all over my body and discovered red rashes that were extremely itchy. Therefore, I came to Shanghai for medical treatment late at night. I have now recovered slightly and plan to return to Beijing tomorrow (i.e., today) by night train.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Achievements of the Shanghai Boy Scouts' General Mobilization <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>More Than 2,000 Aviation Members Enlisted</p>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan Telegraphed to Praise Responsible Sacrifice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Boy Scouts served on the battlefield during the Songhu War and were subjected to Japanese air raids. Deeply concerned about the urgent national crisis, they decided on the 3rd, in accordance with the resolution of the council, to carry out a general mobilization of all members, based on the spirit of service and sacrifice, to promote aviation and recruit members for the Chinese Aviation Construction Association. Their loyalty and dedication to the country have moved and admired all those with human hearts. Therefore, their publicity efforts have had a far-reaching impact at home and abroad. In addition to various schools and student groups in various cities in the country writing to the Aviation Construction Association to request permission to participate in the work, General Weng Zhaoyuan, the representative of the association in the Philippines, also telegraphed yesterday to praise the Shanghai Boy Scouts. People from all walks of life in Shanghai actively joined the association, and more than 2,000 members of various types were enlisted in one day. It can be seen that the Chinese people's support for the Aviation Construction Association is enthusiastic. Yin Zhiling, Lin Jiyong, Zhang Yinyu of the Aviation Construction Association, and Wang Gang, Leng Xueqiao, etc. of the Shanghai Boy Scouts jointly calculated the reports of various groups at the general office in Moore Hall yesterday. The Southeast, Dongya, Ningyi, Moore Hall, and Guanghua groups had the best results, each enlisting more than 100 people. The results of important boy scout groups such as Guangzhao have not yet been reported and will have to wait until this morning to be completely concluded. The following is a record of the telegram from General Weng from the Philippines to the Continental Commercial Market Aviation Construction Association, forwarded to the Shanghai Boy Scouts Council members Wang Leng and all the Boy Scouts: I have just received a telegram from Shanghai informing me that your Boy Scouts have been carrying out extensive publicity for aviation in recent days. Your loyalty and heroic deeds have shocked the world. Not only does this association deeply admire you, but overseas Chinese also praise you without reservation. I hereby present you with the four characters "Responsible Sacrifice" to express my respect. Weng Zhaoyuan, Seal</p>
<h3 id="e95">Li Jingcong Discusses the Importance of Opening the Northwest Air Route <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>▲ Can Shorten the Schedule of Mail to Europe</p>
<p>A reporter from the Nihon Shinbun visited Li Jingcong, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, at his private residence yesterday to inquire about the details of the Eurasia Company's Northwest Air Administration. Mr. Li said: Since the September 18th Incident, the government has implemented a blockade of postal services in the Northeast. All mail to Europe has been ordered to be transported via the Suez Canal, which takes at least a month to arrive. In order to save time, Chinese and foreign people often cannot sympathize with the government's difficulties and privately submit their mail to a certain party in the hope that it can still be transported via Siberia. However, even with this kind of submission, it still takes at least 20 days or more to arrive. After the opening of the Northwest Air Route, if all mail to Europe can be transported by plane to Tacheng on the Sino-Russian border (from Shanghai to Tacheng, it takes about three days in winter), and then transferred by train to Xihuo (from Tacheng to Xihuo Bolu, it takes about four days), in order to be transferred by train to Europe (from Xihuo Bolu to Europe, it takes about seven or eight days), then it can be delivered in at most 14 or 15 days. If, in the future, the company's planes can carry mail directly to Europe via Russia, or Russian planes can fly to Tacheng in order to connect with Eurasian planes, then it can be delivered in at most six or seven days. Minister Zhu (Jiahua) believes that whether the Northwest Air Route can only fly to Tacheng, or can fly directly to Europe, or can connect at the Sino-Russian border, it is faster to transport by this method than by any other method, and it is enough to restore vested interests so that there is no more malfeasance of privately submitting mail to a certain party for transfer and to achieve the purpose of implementing a blockade of postal services in the Northeast. Therefore, he attaches great importance to this air route and has repeatedly instructed me to urge Mr. Schmidt, the director of the Aviation Group of the Eurasia Aviation Company, to complete the trial flight work. The No. 5 aircraft that successfully trialed the Northwest has already returned to Shanghai with me the day before yesterday and is actively preparing to proceed in order to open the route when the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee convenes on the 15th of this month. As for the rumors that I will be appointed as the general manager of the company, they are not true. Since I have been the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, I have been so busy with affairs that I can hardly leave Beijing. I have no energy to take on such an important position. Because the Ministry's affairs are urgently waiting to be dealt with, I have decided to return to Beijing by overnight train tomorrow night (i.e., tonight).</p>

<p>▲ Has Now Passed Tongguan and is Advancing Towards Xi'an</p>
<p>The Nihon Shinbun reports that Ms. Lin Pengxia, a female aviator from our country, has reached Tongguan at the end of the month after leaving Shanghai on the 24th and is now advancing towards Xi'an. Ms. Lin sent a letter yesterday to her friend Mr. Xu Tongxun in Shanghai, reporting on the life of the people in the Northwest, saying that the people all live in simple earthen pits and the conditions are extremely difficult. However, the road is still relatively peaceful, which is more peaceful than the banditry that is prevalent in the South. The ultimate goal of this trip is to go to Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai, and other places to conduct inspections and make detailed development plans for future reference, she said.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Land Acquisition Case by the Ministry of Railways <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yu Youren Inspects in Disguise</p>
<p>▲ Villagers Demand Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Let's See the Spirit of the President of the Control Yuan</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Ministry of Railways' requisition of land from the residents of Pengpu Zhenru and other districts to build a new station has not been properly resolved due to the villagers' fierce opposition. It is now heard that in addition to appealing to all sectors for sympathy, the villagers also suspect that there may be other reasons for the Ministry of Railways to requisition so much land when so little is needed. They have submitted a petition to the Control Yuan requesting an investigation. Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, believing that the matter is of great importance, made an unofficial inspection yesterday in disguise, taking his wife and daughters in a car to Pengpu. He was seen by the villagers, who immediately sent representatives to request the Control Yuan to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the inside story of the Ministry of Railways' land acquisition. Mr. Yu immediately replied that the content of this matter is not simple and that he is not in a position to express anything as a government official. However, he can conduct a detailed investigation after returning to Beijing and then handle it impartially, he said. Mr. Yu then inspected for a week and left, returning to his residence, it is said.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: In reply to your letter No. 275, the Shanghai Chinese Candle Industry Association forwarded a report from its member Henry Factory stating that candles shipped to and from the wharf to the inland are being ordered to be detained by the Nanshi office of the Jianghai Customs, claiming that Henry Factory is registered with the Customs and must pay taxes, while Huali Factory is not registered and can be loaded, etc. It is found that goods from Henry and Huali machine-made factories have been handled in accordance with domestic goods tax rates since the Jinjing Tax Office was abolished. Now, those who are registered pay taxes, while those who are not registered are exempt from taxes. Please consult the Tax Affairs Department to handle the matter fairly in accordance with the regulations, etc. It is now learned that the Tax Affairs Department has replied that national goods transported by civil ships from one coastal port to another or to the inland are no longer taxed, except for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Suzhou route. However, the treatment of goods from machine-made factories is still handled in the same way. This Customs has not received any clear orders and is not in a position to change the established case. It is hereby replied accordingly, I hope you will check accordingly, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Recent News on the Construction of the Songhu Memorial Village <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>▲ Soon to Be Completed One After Another The Songhu Memorial Village is being built with donations from Shanghai citizens, local maintenance associations, and overseas Chinese in Singapore, Mufu, and Basheng. When the Songhu Memorial Village Committee was established, it was during the summer season. Committee members Hu Yunqiu, Kui Yanfang, etc., together with people from various war zones, Wang Binyan, Zhang Xiaoliang, Zhu Kaichou, Yang Weiyu, Jin Jushan, and architect Jin Tongyin, etc., braved the hot weather to run around the fields and plan the construction. Those that have been completed successively are in Taicang County, including 30 village houses in Taoyuan Township, 40 village houses in Nan Village, Yiqiao, 35 village houses in North Village, Yiqiao, 5 assembly halls, 37 village houses in Xintang Village, 3 assembly halls, 37 village houses in South Kou, Qile, 5 assembly halls, 27 village houses in North Kou, Qile, and 2 assembly halls. In Jiading County, there are 56 village houses in North Gate Outside Village, 5 assembly halls, 97 village houses in Maqiao Village, 5 assembly halls, and 5 schoolhouses. In Baoshan County, there are 71 village houses in Miaohang Village, 5 assembly halls, 11 schoolhouses, 50 village houses in Zhuyuan Dun Village, 110 village houses in Sanbai Mu Village, 68 village houses in Shiziqiao Village, 44 village houses in Lvqitang Village, 40 village houses in Guijiaqiao Village, and 264 village houses in Dachang Street. Those that have been built but not yet completed are 132 village houses in Gaojing Temple Village, Jiangwan, with one assembly hall and one schoolhouse each, 217 village houses in Wusong Village, 190 village houses in Zhabei Village, 29 village houses in Pengpu Village, 26 village houses in Zhenru Village, and 34 village houses in Yinhang Village in various districts of Shanghai. In Jiading County, there are 46 Lou Tang Street houses. In addition, there are Jiangwan, Wusong, and other unbuilt village houses that are being re-examined and can also be built soon. At that time, due to the large disaster area and limited funds, although the funds were allocated as appropriate, they were still insufficient. Moreover, the disaster victims had no home to return to and were exposed to the wind and dew, which was extremely pitiful. In order to achieve universality and emergency response, the materials and structures were as economical and simple as possible, without taking beauty into account. The cost of each room was only around 150 yuan. It is now heard that the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee has allocated funds for relief to the disaster victims in the war zone, and a part of it is also used for building houses, which is being carried out in an orderly manner and will be gradually completed, which can be regarded as coming to an end. However, in order to prevent miscellaneous use of old bricks during the construction of the village houses, the walls have not been plastered. Now, in the places where the construction has been completed, we are taking advantage of the time before it freezes to rush to use paper muscle to plaster the walls to make them stronger.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Enthusiastic Donations to the Righteous Army <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The following donations from various parties were received yesterday by the Righteous Army Relief Association from various locations: "Zhenjiang Fire Brigade" - A letter from the Zhenjiang First Fire Brigade stated that the Wenhua Bank in their area had specially gifted 100 yuan to the brigade's members as a reward for their participation in the fire fighting at the Pilian Fengxiang Silver Shop, which fortunately prevented the fire from spreading. The brigade felt that firefighting was a public service and should not accept financial rewards to avoid creating a competitive atmosphere on the fire ground and losing the true meaning of public welfare. They unanimously decided to send the full amount to your association to be forwarded to the front lines as a small contribution. This is remitted through the Shanghai Bank. Please accept it - Wu Ji-Yu.</p>
<p>Yu Yan-Zi from the Guanghua Printing Bureau in Yancheng, Wu Ji-Yu, sent a letter stating that on the occasion of his fourth son Yin-Sheng's joyful event, he would contribute 100 yuan saved from the celebration expenses. The money was remitted through the Yancheng Farmers Bank to the Shanghai Xinhua Bank for transfer. "New Fujian Daily" - Chen Chiping, the director of the New Fujian Daily, first collected 1,170 yuan and 55 cents. "Cheng Zhi National Salvation Association" - 18 yuan from the Cheng Zheng National Salvation Association at 54, South Hang Street, Fuzhou.</p>
<p>▲ Xiangcheng Silk Factory Donates to the Righteous Army: The entire workforce of the Xiangcheng Silk Factory on Tiantong Road, Hongkou, adhering to the principle that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, donated money to support the volunteer army so that they can sustain the fight against Japan. Five donation methods were formulated and unanimously adopted: 1. All colleagues will donate 10% of their November salary. 2. Those who engage in game-like activities such as gambling during their spare time will donate 20 cents each. 3. Those who purchase new clothes that are not domestic products will donate according to the purchase price. 4. Those who consume luxury items will donate 30% of the price of the item. A large bamboo tube will be placed for people to donate at any time. It will be inspected once a month, and if it is full of 10 yuan, it will be sent to the Relief Association. The 88 yuan and 70 cents donated from 10% of the November salary will be sent to the Relief Association for verification.</p>
<p>▲ Chaozhou Fellow Townsmen Association Fund-raising Method: The Northeast Volunteer Army is sacrificing for the country while fighting outside Shanhaiguan and is in urgent need of assistance. Those who cannot take up arms should provide financial assistance. The Chaozhou Fellow Townsmen Association has specially proposed six donation methods. Donations are divided into four types. The donation methods are listed below: 1. Sales Donation: The store determines the number of days and allocates a certain percentage of the daily sales as a donation. 2. Employee Monthly Donation: With six months as the temporary period, all employees will contribute a certain percentage of their salary as a monthly donation. 3. Family Monthly Donation: The head of the family donates a certain amount every day, and the children and servants donate a certain amount each per day (such as a certain number of copper coins to arouse the family's patriotic awareness). 4. Individual Donation: Those who cannot donate in accordance with the above three items are welcome to donate freely, either once or monthly. 5. Public Fundraising: The Association will issue several donation booklets. Please ask the Association's directors and enthusiastic patriotic fellow villagers to carry the booklets to solicit donations. The type of donation should be filled in the booklet.

<p>▲ Yousheng Troupe Performs Drama to Raise Funds: In view of the suffering of the compatriots in the Northeast and the arduous battles of the volunteer army, the Yousheng Traveling Troupe performed a drama yesterday at the Tianchan Stage to provide assistance. The order was maintained by the 270, 299, and the Tongyi Public School Children's Army. By 2 PM, the theater was packed with 3,000 people. The performance began with a performance by the Troupe's national music group, followed by speeches by Mr. Tan Bozhi and lawyer Wu Mielu, who briefly described the suffering of the people in the Northeast and our duty to the Northeast. Then, the chairman reported on everything, followed by a performance by the China Harmonica Association. At 2:30 PM, Peking Opera was performed. Mr. Hu Yimeng and Mr. Rong Boming performed "Meilong Town". Mr. Guo and Mr. Wang Zhenming performed the full version of "Lu Yao Knows Horsepower". Mr. Wang Jinkui, Mr. Chen Niuzhong, and Mr. Liu Junlin performed "Heroic Righteousness" as the finale. Mr. Zhu Lianfu, Mr. Rong Boming, Mr. Wu Laopu, Mr. Wu Jiangfeng, and Mr. Wang Zhenming performed the full version of "Four Jinshi". All the gentlemen are senior figures in the amateur opera circles and are very experienced. The performance was very exciting. It is reported that all expenses were borne by the Troupe, and the ticket revenue of approximately 3,000 yuan will be used for Northeast donations.</p>
<p>▲ Leshan Society Generously Donates Public Gifts: The 27th was the auspicious day for the wedding of Mr. Chen Liangyu's grandson. The Leshan Society's entire staff congratulated him with a performance at the Honglou in the French Concession. Mr. Chen was initially unwilling to accept the gifts, but since the Society members were enthusiastic about relief efforts and bore the expenses themselves, he agreed to transfer all the public gifts received from relatives and friends to the Northeast and Henan, Hubei, and Anhui disaster relief funds for the benefit of relatives and friends. On that day, the guests filled the hall, and a total of 443 yuan in public gifts were received and fully transferred to relief efforts. "A cup of water may not be much, but it is still a small help." Such kindness and generosity are commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Inspection Record of the Completion of the Dike Project by the National Flood Relief Association (7) <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government Tea Party Inspection Team returned to the ship at 5:30 PM, and the Jiangxin ship set sail at 6:00 PM and arrived in Anqing at 7:30 PM. Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, and the heads of various departments personally boarded the ship to welcome the team. Military police were densely stationed at the pier, and military music was played in unison. All the team members then disembarked and walked to the nearby Reception Hall outside the South Gate to attend the tea party hosted by the Anhui Provincial Government. During the party, Chairman Wu Zhongxin delivered a welcome speech, stating that he represented the people of Anhui Province in extending a warm welcome to the guests for their inspection visit. He expressed special gratitude to the National Flood Relief Association for building more than a thousand miles of dikes in Anhui Province, which benefited the disaster victims and enabled the rapid recovery of the rural economy.</p>
<p>Politics and Economy: Wu stated that he would like to present the Anhui Provincial Government's recent measures to the guests. Regarding the construction part, he requested Director Liu Yiyan of the Construction Department to report. He stated that in terms of politics and economy, the provincial government had recently made every effort to maintain social order, so it attached great importance to bandit suppression. Fortunately, the banditry in western Anhui had been quelled in recent months, and even small groups of bandits had been completely eliminated. He was now actively handling the aftermath and organizing rehabilitation matters. The finances of Anhui Province had been reduced from more than 16 million yuan to more than 8 million yuan, and the income and expenditure were just enough to offset each other. In addition, there was a special budget of approximately 4 million yuan for construction projects. If this could be maintained, he firmly believed that the construction of a new Anhui would not be too far off. He asked for forgiveness for the inadequate hospitality and wished everyone a safe journey.</p>
<p>Construction of Anhui: Liu Yiyan, Director of the Construction Department of Anhui Province, reported on the construction undertakings of Anhui Province. He stated that the dikes built by the National Flood Relief Association in Anhui Province were particularly related to the future of Anhui's construction. Anhui's construction was very rudimentary and far behind Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces. The biggest reason for this was the intertwined threat of bandits and floods. Last year's floods caused rural decline and economic bankruptcy, making disaster relief a priority, let alone construction. Fortunately, with the assistance of friendly countries, the great dike project was completed. The inland river project was also successfully completed with the assistance of the Flood Relief Association. As a result, a bumper harvest was achieved this year, allowing for surplus resources to be used for construction. This should be especially thanked. He was deeply honored that prominent figures from home and abroad had come to inspect the completed dike project. He stated that the construction projects could not be fully described in a few words, and that printed materials had been prepared for reference and guidance. The main points were: 1. Transportation: Anhui Province originally had more than a thousand miles of highways, but they had been poorly maintained for many years and had not been paved with stone slabs. The projects were hastily done, and the bridges were also old. Efforts were now being made to repair them so that they could become formal highways. The sections that had been opened to traffic included the Anhe Road (Anqing to Hefei), the Hebang Road (Hefei to Bengbu), and the Wutun Road. The sections under construction included the Jingwu Road, which was expected to be open to traffic in about a month, and the Wuchang Road, which was expected to be open to traffic in about two months. 2. Water Conservancy: The principle of promoting water conservancy projects by using local resources as much as possible was adopted. Attention should be paid to repairing dikes, dredging ditches, and managing ponds so that the completed dike project could be maintained permanently. As for the administrative organization of water conservancy, the Construction Department had water conservancy engineering committees in each county, sub-committees in each district under the county, and dike engineering committees in each dike under the district. Other aspects such as forestry, mining, and tea were all being actively planned for development and improvement.</p>
<p>Li Zushen delivered a reply, followed by a speech by Dr. Bai Shuren, President of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, who stated that Vice Chairman Simpson was feeling slightly unwell and had disembarked in Wuhu to rest in the hospital before heading to Hankou to join the team. He was deeply sorry that he could not participate in tonight's grand gathering. He apologized to the Chairman on behalf of Vice Chairman Simpson. Li Zushen then delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the Flood Relief Association, stating that he was deeply grateful for the grand hospitality of Chairman Wu of the Anhui Provincial Government and the county chiefs and committee members. He had heard that everyone had been waiting at the pier since 2:00 PM, which made him feel very sorry. At that time, his colleagues had witnessed the collapse of the Ma Jiawo riverbank and had temporarily stopped the ship to conduct an on-site inspection, as they had to personally study the protection of the dike project carefully. The round trip took a long time and delayed the schedule, so he apologized to everyone and asked for forgiveness. Li also reported on the establishment of the Flood Relief Association, concluding that the greatest contribution to the completion of the dike project was the millions of disaster relief workers. Xu Shiying and Zhou Xiangxian also delivered speeches. The party ended at 10:00 PM, and the team returned to the ship. The Jiangxin ship set sail at 10:30 PM and arrived at the mouth of the Huayang River at 2:30 AM on December 1.</p>
<p>Ma Hua Dike Project: At 8:00 AM, the entire team took the Anjie small boat specially prepared by the Anhui Provincial Government to Huayang Town to inspect the Ma Hua Dike. Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, also accompanied the team. The small boat sailed into the Huayang River, which was turbulent and winding. It took several miles to reach Huayang Town. The first stop was the opposite bank of Huayang Town to inspect the starting point of the Ma Hua Dike. The Ma Hua Dike was also an important dike project. Its territory was located in the three provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei, and directly affected seven counties. In terms of terrain, it was not of great importance, but its location in the three provinces made it important. It was reported that the Flood Relief Association had originally planned to abandon it, but it started construction at the request of local people. At that time, it was most difficult to hire workers because the authorities of the three provinces were unwilling to take responsibility in this no man's land. Various methods were used to barely complete the project. The dike was 9 meters wide and more than 50 kilometers long. The mud was solid, and the project was very strong, making it suitable for highway traffic. However, according to Mr. Xi Dejiong, the dike was twice as wide as ordinary dikes, and there was no need to widen it in terms of terrain, which was not in line with economic principles. Farmers also built houses on the dike, which hindered traffic. The local authorities should pay attention to this. The team then went to the opposite bank of Huayang Town to inspect the Ma Hua Dike and the location where local people planned to build a sluice gate. At 10:30 AM, the team returned to the Jiangxin ship, which sailed from Huayang, marking the end of the inspection work in the third district.</p>
<p>Inspection of Huikou: At 12:30 PM, the team arrived in Pengze. Local gentry boarded the ship to welcome the team. Pengze was surrounded by mountains on three sides, and houses were built against the mountains in a neat row, making for a beautiful scenery. After stopping for about ten minutes, the ship sailed again. County Chief Jiang Ji of Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province, boarded the ship in a small boat to welcome the team. At 3:30 PM, the team arrived in Huikou. The team took the Lihu small boat to the north bank to inspect the Huikou Dike. County Chief Jiang Ji of Jiujiang County also accompanied the team. After landing, the team walked about a mile to reach the new dike. The dike was about 5 meters wide and 9.5 kilometers long, extending from Lao Zhou Tou on the Anhui border in the east to Wuxue in the west. The old dike near the river had collapsed. There were about a hundred households and some shops, making it a relatively lively village about 60 miles from Jiujiang. The Huikou Dike belonged to the fourth district project, but because it was completely contracted by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, it became a special district managed by the Jiujiang Chinese and Foreign Relief Association. Any matters should be reported to the Shanghai General Association. The inspection ended at 4:30 PM, and the team returned to the large ship, which sailed again. The team then went to inspect Duanyao at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Inspection of Duanyao Dike: Duanyao Town belonged to Huangmei County, Hubei Province, and was part of the fourth district dike project contracted by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association. It connected Jiujiang in the west and Huikou in the east. The team disembarked in a small boat. County Chief Gui Fucang of Huangmei County and local gentry were already waiting at the riverbank. They accompanied the team for about two miles to reach the Duanyao Dike. The dike was 4 meters wide and about 11.5 kilometers long. As dusk was approaching, the team conducted a brief inspection and returned to the riverbank. County Chief Gui welcomed the team to the Zhao Deng Suo (recruitment and waiting place) by the river, which was used as a warehouse. The rooms were full of welcome slogans, and tea and snacks were prepared. County Chief Gui delivered a welcome speech and reported on the Duanyao Dike, stating that there were still three gaps in the Duanyao Dike that had not been repaired: 1. 2.5 kilometers long. 2. 1.5 kilometers long. 3. 1 kilometer long. The estimated cost of repairing the dike was 20,000 yuan, which was being requested from the Flood Relief Association by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association. He then represented the people of the county in asking the Flood Relief Association not to move the dike back to avoid approaching the river channel behind it. The county government would do its best to protect the new dike. It was reported that the Flood Relief Association was very dissatisfied with the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association's request for funds. The team returned to the ship at 7:00 PM, and the Jiangxin ship sailed directly to Jiujiang.</p>
<p>A small part of the dikes in the fourth and fifth districts of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, totaling 133.7 kilometers in length, was contracted by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association. The area on the south bank of the Yangtze River from Jiujiang to Wuxue and the north bank from Lao Zhou Tou Town to Wuxue (including the Huikou Dike) belonged to the fourth district: 1. Jiujiang to Shizi Mountain Dike: 33.5 kilometers long. 2. Lao Zhou Tou to Chen Jiaying Dike: 28.4 kilometers long. The area in the fifth district included: 1. Chen Jiaying to Xiao Chi Kou: 32 kilometers long. 2. Xiao Chi Kou to Wuxue: 42 kilometers long. The Flood Relief Association issued a total of 5,318.8 tons of wheat and grain to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, and the salaries of the staff and all miscellaneous expenses were paid by the Relief Association, totaling more than 90,000 yuan. Of the total length of 133 kilometers of dikes, 23 kilometers were newly built, 81 kilometers were repaired, and the rest were slightly repaired. This area was essentially a special district directly under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai General Association of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association.

<p>▲ Resolution that the Company will not be Established</p>
<p>▲ And Schedule for Power Outage Set</p>
<p>The Zhenhai Electric Light Co., Ltd. convened a general meeting of all promoters and shareholders yesterday afternoon at the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in the city. Dozens of people including Fu Xiaoan, Xu Shengchan, and Zhu Zikui attended. Chairman Wu Yaqin reported that the previously established company had been losing money and accumulating debt for many years because some influential users refused to pay the electricity bills in full and arbitrarily discounted them, making it impossible to maintain operations. In order to ensure public use, he accepted the takeover and continued to generate electricity, while actively soliciting shares and notifying users to cancel discounts and pay in full, and prohibiting electricity theft. However, his words were not heeded. As a result, the company's income did not improve, potential shareholders were hesitant to invest, and existing shareholders were unwilling to pay and questioned the situation. In this situation, not only was there no hope for the company to be formally established, but it was also feared that power generation could not be maintained. Then, Manager Yu reported on the business situation and the collection of fees, stating that the total number of users who refused to pay in full reached more than 1,000 yuan per day, resulting in significant losses. Subsequently, shareholders Qian Zhongdao, Yu Shouchun, and Liu Wanqing, and promoters Zhu Nanzhou and Dai Chengzhi, successively expressed their opinions, unanimously advocating for the dissolution of the company and the suspension of power generation. The following resolutions were passed by the entire body: 1. It was decided that the company would not be established and the preparatory office would be dissolved. 2. It was decided that power generation would be suspended starting from the 16th of this month. 3. A report on the resolution not to establish the company and the date of power suspension would be submitted to the Zhejiang Construction Department and the Zhenhai County Government for the record. 4. Notices would be sent to all users to inform them. 5. A public announcement would be made in the newspaper to inform the public. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>

<p>▲ Held at the Tianchan Stage Starting Today</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang departed to suppress bandits, the banditry in the provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei has been gradually cleared. However, the people of these three provinces have suffered first from the Communist bandits and then from the losses of war. Their displacement and suffering are truly indescribable. Chairman Chiang, witnessing this firsthand, felt great sympathy and wrote to prominent Shanghai figures like Shi Liangcai, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin, requesting them to initiate a drama performance to raise relief funds. It has now been decided that for the next three days, starting today, the Tianchan Stage will be used, and famous Shanghai actresses and respected elders of the opera world, Yao and Jiang, who have been off the stage for a long time, have been invited to perform their signature works. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime grand event. Shanghai is not lacking in people who are enthusiastic about charity, and at this grand event, there will surely be a large crowd. Good seats are limited, so those who wish to see it should go to Tianchan early to buy tickets.</p>

<p>The Fuan Company of Xiaodongmen, a large department store in the Nanshi district that promotes global goods and Chinese products, is widely praised by the public.

All of us as citizens should not stand idly by. The Fuan Company is happy to do good and fulfill its duty to provide relief. It will donate 5% of its sales revenue for the 4th, 5th, and 6th of this month to aid the Northeast refugees. It is deeply hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will open their wallets. One more purchase of goods means one more life saved. This will bring boundless blessings.</p>

<p>Mr. Qu Shaoheng graduated from Osaka Medical University in Japan. He returned to China in 1916 and founded the Qu Family Hospital with his wife, Ms. Yao Yingnai, in Beijing. He used his years of academic knowledge to bring happiness to the local people. Before long, his reputation grew. In 1922, the Ministry of Education planned to send specialists to Europe, to countries like Sweden, to study medicine. Knowing that Mr. Qu had rich experience and knowledge, he was immediately appointed as a medical research specialist. He spent three years in Europe. In 1924, he returned to China. Seeing the lack of obstetrical facilities in the country, he established an obstetrical hospital in Beijing and opened a women's obstetrical school, personally taking on teaching duties. To this day, many graduates have served in society, so all circles in the former capital respect and praise Mr. and Mrs. Qu. From this, it can be seen that Mr. and Mrs. Qu have done much for the benefit of the people in the medical field during their 17 years in Beijing. Now, it is known that Mr. and Mrs. Qu have recently moved south to Shanghai because their relatives and friends in Shanghai longed for their return. At the same time, his elder brother, Mr. Shao Yi, felt deeply regretful that his younger brother had lived in the north for so long and had not been able to fulfill his duty to the poor and sick in his hometown. Therefore, he repeatedly urged them by telegram to return south to establish a hospital for consultation, so that the poor and those unable to afford medical treatment could have the opportunity for examination. Mr. Qu was deeply moved by the telegram and resolutely left Beijing and moved the Qu Family Hospital to Shanghai on the 28th of last month. They arrived in Shanghai on the 30th of last month. The hospital is now located at Nos. 32 to 34 Ningbo Road, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, behind the Ningbo Guild Hall. Outpatient services are available from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. every day. House calls are available after 2:00 p.m. for temporary emergencies. Mr. and Mrs. Qu have the heart of benevolent doctors, so they do not charge the poor for consultations. This is also a ray of light for the medical community and a blessing for patients.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Large-Scale Smuggling Agencies and Distribution Centers are Established <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Selling Opium is Very Cautious</p>
<p>Often Sends Followers to Secretly Follow Opium Buyers</p>
<p>Police Raided Two Distribution Centers</p>
<p>Each Sentenced to Six Months and Fined 300 Yuan</p>
<p>A Chaozhou Guangchang Company is a large opium trafficking agency. It has established many distribution centers in the Public Concession, which are very secret, and the police authorities have no way to investigate. A few days ago, detectives from the Narcotics Division learned that opium was sold at No. 584 Zhoujiazui Road and an unmarked bungalow on Zhaofeng Road. They sent people with money to buy it and found that it was true. They then went to the two places with Detective Chief Bai Po to arrest two Cantonese, Mei Guilin, and Ningbo, Wang Jisheng. They confiscated 29 taels of opium, a large bag of opium ash, scales, scissors, ledgers, and more than ten yuan in foreign currency. They were taken to the Huishan Police Station for detention and sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court the next morning. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the facts of the case and said that the head office, Guangchang, was large and difficult to arrest. The distribution centers were very cautious in selling opium. Whenever someone came to buy opium, they would observe the person's appearance and clothing and send followers in cars to secretly follow them to see if they were sent by the police. Therefore, he requested a severe punishment. After submitting the opium and other evidence, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the progress of the case and questioned the two defendants, whose statements were evasive. After detailed interrogation by the court, they admitted that the principal offender was Cantonese Yang Weiyi, who had already fled. They begged for leniency. Judge Shen Bingrong reviewed the confession and made a clear judgment, sentencing the defendants Mei Guilin and Wang Jisheng to six months of imprisonment each for helping to sell opium, and fining them 300 yuan each. If the fine is not paid after compulsory execution, it will be commuted to one day of imprisonment for every two yuan. The number of days detained before the judgment is determined shall be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The opium and other items shall be confiscated according to the list.</p>

<p>│See the letter from Ms. Zhang Qiuyun, December 21st│</p>
<p>I believe that love between husband and wife is mostly built on "spirit"│shared interests and learning. In other words: the union of husband and wife must take "spiritual" beauty as the primary condition. If the two sides have conflicting interests and cannot have equivalent learning, then no matter how talented and beautiful you are, love cannot last forever.</p>
<p>The current society has created the phenomenon that Ms. Yun Qiuyun described as "the love of newlyweds changes from concentrated to diluted, and then to: : : tragedy," because most people only pursue "flesh"—appearance—when choosing a partner, and ignore or even completely abandon the pursuit of "spirit."</p>
<p>"Flesh" has some influence on the love between husband and wife, and I cannot deny this; especially during the honeymoon period, the love between husband and wife almost entirely starts from "flesh." It would be desirable if the love between husband and wife could be as strong and sweet as during the honeymoon; however, facts tell me that this is absolutely impossible. For a husband and wife to grow old together and to prevent love from dropping from the boiling point to the freezing point and staging a tragic breakup, one must pay attention to the "spirit" in the process of love; to be clear, one must take the other party's character and learning, compatibility of interests as the first issues before getting engaged.</p>
<p>Whether the love between Ms. Qiuyun and the other party is completely built on "flesh," whether her interests are compatible with the other party's, and what the other party's character and learning are like, I have no way of knowing. Of course, if one does not understand someone, one is not qualified to answer for them. However, I have two contributions that may be sufficient for the lady's reference in making her own decision:</p>
<p>1.  If the other party's interests are compatible with her, and their character and learning are not bad, and only the love is not as strong and sweet as during the honeymoon, and more emphasis is placed on obligations, then it can be said to be natural and not a problem; the reason is that there is an obligation if there is a right, there is joy if there is suffering, and the cycle of joy and suffering is "life." The moon has dark and bright phases, and flowers bloom and fall; nature is giving us many hints.</p>
<p>2.  If the other party's interests are completely contrary to her, and their character and learning are bad, then the only way out is divorce; otherwise, it will only increase the pain.</p>
<p>Reporter's Note: The discussion of this issue is not yet over, and we hope that readers will express their great opinions and discuss it enthusiastically.</p>

<p>I recently saw a letter in your newspaper's Reader Consultant column from Mr. Liu Xue asking about the Anhui Fellow Association's accusation against the Disaster Relief Committee for investigating Mianzhong et al. The second point: "If the accusation is not true, how should the false accuser be punished?" The third point: "Assuming the accusation is true, how should Cha Mianzhong et al. be punished?" Attached is the opinion of your newspaper's reporter, inviting everyone to participate in the discussion. I think that this case has already been brought to justice and should be resolved according to law. Now that this case is in legal proceedings, in order to respect the law, both the plaintiff, the defendant, and the third party should wait quietly for the court to adjudicate in accordance with the law. Anyone who is in the position of a third party should pay attention to two points:</p>
<p>1.  Are the newspapers uniformly recording and publishing the progress of the case's legal trial and the testimonies of both parties with an objective attitude?</p>
<p>2.  Can the court make a fair and legal judgment? And is the judge's attitude toward this case fair and impartial?</p>
<p>In addition, in order to cultivate the spirit of the rule of law, there seems to be no need for discussion.</p>

<p>I am a businessman, currently working as a teacher at a certain school, with a monthly salary of about 150 yuan. However, my expenses are extremely high. Household expenses alone require at least 70 or 80 yuan each month. The biggest burden is the education of my three sons. The eldest is a sophomore at a certain university in this city, and his tuition, board, and other fees cost about 200 yuan every half year. The second is my daughter, a junior at a certain middle school in this city, which costs 150 or 160 yuan per semester. The third son is only ten years old and attending elementary school, which still costs over 100 yuan every half year. And my fourth child is already five years old and urgently needs to start school. Every semester, this huge tuition fee truly drives me crazy, like an ant on a hot pan, with no solution in sight. I thought about having my eldest son drop out and find some work, but he's only two years away from graduating, and I can't bear to have his efforts wasted. I thought about having my daughter drop out, but she cries and even goes on hunger strike when I mention it. As for the third son, he's still in elementary school, and there's even less reason to have him drop out. But this won't work, and that won't work, and I really can't afford it anymore, I can't take another step. I have served in the education field for over ten years, and I always advise people to study, but while I teach other people's children, my own children face the threat of dropping out every day. This not only makes me doubt my own profession but also makes me deeply feel the difficulty of being a responsible father and brother. I remember that a few years ago, a tailor in this city committed suicide out of shame and anger because he couldn't afford to send his children to school, using his death to apologize to his children. I also have such thoughts from time to time. However, I think, in this society, there must be countless people in situations like mine. This is truly a very serious social problem. Sir, how should this problem be solved? Please submit it for everyone's discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e123">### Dance Hall Queen Wang Yuezhen Sues Lover for Seduction <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Lived Together for Six Months, Now Suddenly Parted</p>
<p>If I Had Known Today, I Wouldn't Have Done It Then</p>
<p>Wang Yuezhen, a nineteen-year-old girl from Huai'an, Jiangsu, with a beautiful appearance, lives at No. 10 Shendeli, Baker Road. She works as a dance hostess at the Great Shanghai Dance Hall. In April of this year, she suddenly had a physical relationship with a dance patron from Guangdong, Ke Gongjie, and then began living together as lovers. Ke rented No. 18 Le'an Lane, Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession as a place to hide his mistress. It has been about six months now, and a rift suddenly appeared in their relationship, leading them to extremes. Ms. Wang, together with her father, Wang Yao'san, hired lawyer Wu Chengyu to file a criminal complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Ke of offenses such as marriage fraud and seduction. The main points of the accusation are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Yuezhen, the plaintiff, is only nineteen years old and quite lovely. Due to living problems, she works as a dance hostess at the Great Shanghai Dance Hall. In April of this year, the defendant Ke Gongjie, seeing that the plaintiff had some looks, used fraudulent marriage methods to achieve the purpose of seduction. The plaintiff was young and ignorant and was eventually seduced away at the Great Shanghai Dance Hall and allowed to be sexually abused. Since then, she has been living with him at No. 18 Le'an Lane, Avenue Joffre, and has not returned home. The plaintiff searched everywhere for the plaintiff until November 5th, when she finally found her whereabouts and brought her back. However, while passing Avenue Edward VII, two foreigners recognized the plaintiff and said that Ke was sick and asked them to represent him in greeting and following her. Upon hearing this, the plaintiff was shocked and indignant. The plaintiff believes that the defendant not only seduced a virgin but also dared to instigate people to follow her, showing extreme disregard for the law. Now, the defendant, in order to achieve the purpose of sexual abuse, falsely claimed to be unmarried and willing to marry the plaintiff as his wife. There is no doubt that he used improper means to obtain the plaintiff's consent and thus gain the power of control. However, the location of the defendant's crime was the Great Shanghai Dance Hall, which is under the jurisdiction of your court. Therefore, I am forced to file this lawsuit, requesting that you quickly arrest the defendant, interrogate him, and punish him for the crime of seduction under Articles 257, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law to deter wrongdoing. In addition, I am filing a civil suit, requesting that the court order the defendant to compensate the plaintiff with a lifetime maintenance fee of 15,120 yuan (calculated at 30 yuan per month until the age of 60) to maintain her livelihood.</p>
<p>The court issued a subpoena based on the complaint. Because the defendant was ill and receiving treatment at the Sacred Heart Hospital on Ningguo Road in Yangshupu, police officer Guo Xiangyao No. 2591 from the Chinese constabulary informed the defendant through the hospital. The defendant saw that Guo's illness was extremely serious and he could not hold a pen. The doctor said that Ke Gongjie's illness was terminal and he would not live long. However, Ke勉力 signed the subpoena, but the doctor did not allow the subpoena and a copy of the complaint to be kept, fearing it would worsen his condition. Therefore, the officer returned the subpoena, etc. Yesterday afternoon, judge Wu Tingqi of the Special Court opened the Second Criminal Court for interrogation. After officer Guo reported the circumstances of the delivery of the subpoena, Judge Wu ruled that because the defendant was seriously ill and unable to appear in court to respond, the case could not proceed. He ordered a postponement until the defendant recovered from his illness.</p>
<h3 id="e124">### Large Group of Bandits in the Southwest of Shanghai Arrested <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>▲ Mostly Local Intellectuals</p>
<p>▲ Their Heinous Crimes Have Reached Their Limit, They Are All Apprehended</p>
<p>Recently, major cases of robbery, kidnapping, and extortion have occurred frequently in various towns and villages in the jurisdiction of the Second District of the Southwest, such as Tangwan and Caohang. Although the authorities have tightened their investigations after the cases, they have rarely been solved. Now, due to the arrest of the bandit Ding Botao in the case of the extortion of a huge sum of money from Pan Zhuxi and Shen Zhu'an in Caohang Town last month, who was sentenced to eight years in prison by the local court after interrogation by the Public Security Section, clues were obtained. Subsequently, under the secret instructions of Magistrate Yan, the Chief of the Public Security Section, Yao Fusheng, and Inspector Xu Yi, etc., paid attention to the investigation. Yao and others, together with detectives, thoroughly investigated the bandit situation in the area and learned the hideouts of various bandit gangs. They then quietly coordinated with the police of the British and French Concessions to arrest six bandits, Peng Jieren, Chen Zhuxin, Chen Haiqing, Chen Haishan, Zhang Zhaoxiang, Wang A'tudi, etc., at Anle Hotel, Wuding Road, and other places. Two pistols were seized and they were all escorted to the government office for detention. However, it was found that most of the bandits were local intellectuals who were the main leaders of the bandits. They also had some hidden power in the locality. They usually ran rampant in the countryside, committing all kinds of evil deeds. They knew who was rich and who had no money like the back of their hand. Those with a reputation and status did not dare to offend them for fear of being assassinated and could only avoid them from afar, so that these people became even more unscrupulous and regarded the law as nothing. In August of this year, when the bandit gang planned to rob a certain place, they encountered the Changqiao Security Corps and dared to resist arrest and open fire, but were scattered and fled. This time, their heinous crimes have reached their limit and they have all been apprehended. It is truly a case of the net of justice being wide and the people are celebrating the removal of this great scourge, otherwise, it would be difficult to live in peace. Since being escorted to the county, the bandits have been interrogated in detail day and night by Yao, the Chief of the Public Security Section. It is reported that the bandits have mostly confessed to their crimes and will soon be transferred to the court for trial. In addition to sending personnel to the British and French police to thank the detectives for their assistance, Magistrate Yan has also rewarded the personnel in charge of handling the case for their efforts.</p>

<p>Yesterday around 11:00 AM, a woman wearing a freedom cloth cheongsam, with short hair, and about 30 years old, intended to go to a certain "red boy" den in Ruifuli, Rue Amiral de Mer, in the French Concession to take red pills. However, when she reached the back door of No. 57, Lane 6, she suddenly collapsed and died due to poisoning. After death, the woman's body was found to be yellow all over.

<h3 id="e129">### Young Man Crushed to Death by a Public Bus <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Cai Jionglin, a 21-year-old from Changshu, lived at No. 1055 Siwenli, Xinzhapu Road. His family was poor and his father was old. He used to be a tailor, but recently, he was unemployed at home. His mother worked as a servant to supplement the family income. His younger brother was only eight years old. A few months ago, he was introduced to work as an accountant at a certain restaurant on Caishi Road, and the family depended on him. To save on commuting expenses, he borrowed a bicycle. On the day before yesterday (2nd), at around 10:00 PM, he was riding his bicycle home from the shop. When he reached Datong Road and Xinzha Road, a No. 10 public bus, disregarding traffic rules, did not stop at the station and drove straight on. He shouted for the bus to stop, but he had already been hit and killed. The next day, his parents were very worried because their son had not returned home all night, but they thought he might have stayed at the shop due to the rain. When they heard rumors from neighbors, they went out to inquire. Yan Wenhan, a clerk from Yuan Tai Xiang, explained that he had witnessed everything and was willing to testify. Knowing that the deceased was their son, the old mother and young brother suffered a great blow and were in extreme grief. The scene was unbearable to witness. The public bus company should show humanitarian consideration and provide generous compensation. It is reported that the court will open a trial on this matter within days.</p>

The Southeast B team ultimately defeated Chongde, avenging their previous defeat, and the championship was won by Southeast. The score was 29 to 16.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the two teams competed fiercely, each scoring points, and the situation was tense. In the first eight minutes, Southeast took the lead by one point, with the score at 8 to 7. From the second quarter onwards, Southeast's momentum suddenly surged, becoming unstoppable. Chongde found it difficult to attack and defend, making a poor showing. Chongde only scored two points, while Southeast scored as many as nine points. Chongde suffered a major blow and found it difficult to win the championship.</p>
<p>In the first half, Southeast had already won with a score of 17 to 9. Their spirits were greatly boosted, their courage was strong, and their power was awe-inspiring.

<p>Continued Inspection in the Rain on the 2nd</p>
<p>Nantong Schools and People's Education Halls</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent from Nantong) As reported yesterday, Jiangsu Education Director Zhou Fohai came to Nantong on the first of this month to inspect education. It is now learned that this morning (2nd) at 8:00 AM, Director Zhou led Section Chiefs Chen Xiang and Cao Yi, Supervisors Yi and Li, and others to Tongzhong Provincial School to inspect twelve classes, including Senior 1B Literature, Senior 1A Party Principles, Teacher 2 Elementary School Teaching Methods, Senior 2A Chinese History, Senior 2B English, Junior 2 Chemistry, General 1C Chinese, Junior 1A English, Junior 1B Chinese, Junior 2B Chinese, Junior 2A Chinese, and General 3 English Composition, with the topic "Welcome Our Jiangsu Education Director." After the inspection, they went to Tongzhong Experimental Elementary School at the invitation of the school principal to give a speech to the children, stating that elementary school education is the basic training for citizens and should follow the teachings of teachers, cultivate noble morals, develop a beautiful school spirit, and cultivate good habits of group life in order to become the backbone of the country in the future.

<p>Notes</p>
<p>1.  For written arithmetic, items 1 to 11 of the first and second grades are taught in the first academic year without using formulas, and only arithmetic knowledge is provided on a random basis, so the time is only set at 60 minutes per week. Item 12 and below are taught in the second academic year. Items 1 to 16 of the third and fourth grades can be listed in the third academic year, and items 17 and below can be listed in the fourth academic year. Items 1 to 16 of the fifth and sixth grades can be listed in the fifth academic year, and the rest can be included in the sixth academic year. Abacus calculation starts from the fourth academic year.</p>
<p>2.  In villages or remote areas, the children in the first and second grades are older. Before entering school, they already have a lot of quantitative experience and common sense, as well as calculation habits. Therefore, it is appropriate to assign the items of the first and second grades and items 1 to 15 of the third and fourth grades in a row, and complete them in about two years.</p>
<p>3.  If there is a need for foreign weights and measures and foreign currencies in various places, they can be appropriately increased. For example, in Qingdao, South Manchuria, etc., a comparison of the Chinese-Japanese system can be added. Other similar cases can be inferred. Those who do not need it in the mainland can be omitted.</p>
<p>4.  Key Points of Teaching Methods</p>
<p>(1) The arithmetic in the first academic year should be taught randomly without specifying formal time, or it can be linked with other designs for teaching. The second academic year can be the same as the first academic year, or formal time can be specified for teaching. It is up to each school to implement it according to its own convenience.</p>
<p>(2) The arithmetic below the third and fourth grades should be fully linked with other designs for teaching. In the teaching time of each section, the third and fourth grades should extract 5 to 10 minutes, and the fifth and sixth grades should extract 10 minutes for independent practice of calculation skills. From the fourth grade, "Arithmetic Practice Test" should also be used.</p>
<p>(3) The materials in the first and second academic years should be based on daily food, clothing, and supplies. The third and fourth academic years should be based on food, clothing, housing, transportation, school assignments, and family economics. The fifth and sixth academic years should be based on economic issues such as food, clothing, housing, transportation, schools, families, society, and international relations, with special emphasis on practice in buying and selling, finding change, and discounts, but they must be used flexibly according to local conditions and children's interests.</p>
<p>(4) The homework in the first and second academic years must be entrusted to games, and taught using methods such as competitions, or store opening exercises. This method must also be applied frequently after the third academic year so that children work hard out of interest.</p>
<p>(5) The problems must be concrete and interesting. In the lower grades, the method of performance should be fully used to turn the problem into a fact so that the children can see it directly. Up to the third and fourth grades, the problem should also be made into a story to help the children imagine the facts.</p>
<p>(6) The writing of the problems must be clear and simple, and the content must not be convoluted so that children cannot easily understand it.</p>
<p>(7) New methods and principles should start from practical needs, first making children understand the usefulness of the method, and proceeding step by step using the inductive method. Avoid using the deductive method.</p>
<p>(8) The calculation methods for solving problems do not need to use too much theoretical analysis, but must appeal to children's experience and common sense.</p>
<p>(9) Mental calculation is the foundation of arithmetic and must be practiced very skillfully.</p>
<p>(10) Special attention should be paid to practicing the algorithm of short numbers (that is, numbers within ten) used in daily life.</p>
<p>(11) Written calculation and abacus calculation are both tools to help with mental calculation. Of course, schools can teach both abacus calculation, because it is more difficult to learn than written calculation in base ten because of the carry-over. When teaching, it should be fully connected with written calculation and pay attention to the familiarity of fingers.</p>
<p>(12) The formation of habits such as rapid calculation comes gradually and cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, the steps should be carefully planned and applied step by step to seek progress from unfamiliarity to proficiency.</p>
<p>(13) The methods of practice should be varied in many ways, and the interest of children in success should be used to make them work hard.</p>
<p>(14) Approximate calculation and verification calculation should be paid attention to from the beginning of teaching in the lower grades.</p>
<p>(15) In the fifth and sixth grades, attention should be paid to the practice of four operations application problems that are needed in daily life, but the principle is to be simple.</p>

<p>The physical education performance initiated by the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School Boy Scout Group of this port was held at the China Basketball Hall on the evening of the 3rd. About 2,000 guests attended, making it a grand occasion. Chairman Wang Gang was unable to attend due to official business of the Boy Scout Council, so President Lu Lihua represented him in a report, explaining the three facts of the group's initiation of the performance, which was concise, clear, and to the point. There were 28 acts in the performance program, and the most exciting ones were the Angel Dance and the Balloon Dance. The costumes were gorgeous, the movements were novel, and they were supplemented by melodious piano music and colored electric torches, all of which had a wonderful ethereal charm. The Chinese martial art of Tan Tui, with the instructor's loud commands and the participation of the healthy women, each worthy of a heroic figure, won a lot of applause. A certain female student's solo saber performance was skilled and imposing, with the light shining brightly, silencing the timid. The pattern pile was meaningful, and the movements were agile, such as the scene of the Great Wall, which could not help but evoke the feeling of the fragmentation of mountains and rivers. In the final Danish exercise, nearly a hundred performers were able to maintain order in every bow and suppression, which was particularly commendable. The audience also praised the students for their sturdy physique and full spirit, and felt that promoting women's physical education was an urgent task at present. The group's military band was also well-trained and well-received by the guests. The security matters that evening were handled by the Youth Association Middle School and Moore Hall Boy Scouts, and the order was excellent. It was not until half past ten that the closing was announced.</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e163">Statement of Purpose of Publication <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>This year marks the 60th anniversary of this newspaper. Based on the spirit of "old but vigorous" and "unceasing self-improvement," we have been devising plans to advance our work and meet the expectations of our readers. Unfortunately, the "September 18th Incident" and the Shanghai war followed one after another, hindering the progress of our work. Now that the national crisis has not yet been resolved, our colleagues at this newspaper are even more aware that to overcome the national crisis, we must be determined to "fulfill our respective responsibilities" and "take practical action." Therefore, based on this purpose, we will compile and produce a special economic supplement on commercial news every Monday, detailing the economic changes in China and abroad for the week, and compiling various important statistics for reference by those who are interested in the economy. Furthermore, in recent centuries, all political, social, and military issues among nations and internationally have used economic power as the object of their resolution and as their ultimate weapon. This is something that everyone should know and understand. Therefore, the general public should have some economic common sense to cope with these situations. Based on this goal, we will write articles separately to ensure that readers have a reasonable understanding of public and private economics. The scope of our future articles is tentatively set as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Economic Commentary: Provide commentary or forecasts on major domestic and international economic events each week to clarify the past and future situations.</p>
<p>(2) Investment Guidance and Statistics: In recent years, due to political instability, domestic capital has gradually concentrated in Shanghai. This has led to the increasing prosperity of Shanghai and the increasing economic hardship of the interior, which is not a good sign for China's future. With surplus capital flooding into Shanghai, speculation has become rampant, as evidenced by the recent public bond bidding and real estate business. This publication should focus on guiding legitimate investment avenues, introducing various stable Chinese and foreign stocks, bonds, and profitable new businesses. All related statistics and charts should be carefully organized and published as much as possible to fulfill our guiding responsibility, so that the surplus capital in society has a proper path to follow and the trend of speculation may be somewhat curbed.</p>
<p>(3) Investigation and Research of Industry and Commerce: China's current economic backwardness requires the urgent development of industry and commerce. This publication should first investigate the current situation and trends of industry and commerce, and then proceed to study the development and improvement plans. In particular, we should find ways to encourage and support domestic industrial products.</p>
<p>(4) Investigation and Research of Special Economic Organizations in China: China has long suffered from the aggression of foreign economic forces, gradually forming various special economic organizations such as compradors in foreign firms. The evolution and current status of such systems are all worthy of study to clarify the nature of these deformed organizations. In addition, the status of various existing economic organizations in China, such as folk mutual aid societies and various commercial practices, are also included in the investigation and research.</p>
<p>(5) Discussion and Translation of Economic Issues: In recent years, social thought in China has become complex and economic systems cannot be established. Academic discussions on various ideologies such as capitalism and fascism should be conducted to gain some understanding. In addition, valuable economic works from various countries should be translated and introduced to popularize knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition to the above outlines, surveys of important commodities such as rice, cotton, silk, coal, tea, oil, and wheat, research on financial and monetary issues, forecasts of trade and exchange rate changes, and introductions to famous economic works can be added at any time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the writings in this publication strive to be statistical, so that readers have numerical evidence and can be practical. We also plan to compile important economic statistics from January 1933 to provide a clear overview of the overall economic situation. This publication is in its initial stage, and there are many shortcomings. We hope that talents from all over the world will come forward and teach us. We would be most grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Issue of Cash Transportation to the Northeast <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>In the past three months, it has been rumored that 18 to 19 million yuan in cash has been transported from Shanghai to the Northeast. The general public does not know the real reason and believes that it is no different from collecting cash for them to purchase soybeans, a special product of the Northeast, for export to the United States to support Japan's foreign exchange rate. There have been many rumors and debates. Now, after detailed investigation, it is known that there are other special reasons. It is to supply the needs of the residents of the Northeast, which in turn has led to the relationship of deposit and remittance offsetting. Although it is an export from Shanghai, the cash transported is still scattered in the hands of farmers in the Northeast. In a transfer, it is still taken back to China proper by farmers traveling from the Northeast. Those who have lived in the Northeast generally know this. Therefore, the current cash transportation issue is not yet a problem, but how can the economic power of the compatriots in the Northeast break away from the control of foreigners? The people of the country should pay close attention to this. Now, according to the investigation, the following is recorded for reference by those who care about the Northeast's finance: 1. The Chinese population in the three northeastern provinces is said to be 30 million, of which about 70% are farmers. These 21 million farmers are not all natives; a small number are from Zhili, Shandong, and Henan provinces. They go to the Northeast every spring and return in winter. Each winter, they convert their harvest into cash and remit or carry it back to their hometown (because Northeast paper money cannot be used in China proper). Assuming that each person carries back 10 to 20 yuan, or even dozens of yuan, the transaction of remittance or the need for cash will suddenly increase by tens of millions of yuan every winter.</p>
<p>2. Most of these farmers from other provinces live in areas without banks in China proper. Due to the popularity of post offices, most of them have traditionally entrusted the post office to remit money back to China proper before returning home at the end of the year. The total amount of these post office and bank remittances amounts to no less than tens of millions of yuan each year. Recently, due to the withdrawal of the national postal service, it is not possible to remit all through banks. They do not trust the paper money of the Central Bank of Manchuria. Moreover, because Northeast paper money cannot circulate in China proper and cannot be brought back for use, they have to exchange all of it for cash and carry it with them. Moreover, the people of the Northeast are unsettled. Even the settled immigrants often exchange the paper money they have prepared for cash to seek security. This is why there is a huge demand for cash in the Northeast recently.</p>
<p>3. After the "September 18th Incident," the Chinese-run silver firms and banks in the Northeast continued to operate as before to maintain their original economic position. Those in Dalian, Yingkou, and other places in the south are also the same as before and have not changed. Moreover, due to the floods in northern Manchuria and the unrest in various places, people are uneasy and businesses are sluggish. The general public, with patriotic hearts, still deposits their savings in domestic silver firms and banks. Therefore, since the "September 18th Incident," the deposits of Chinese-owned silver firms and banks in the Northeast have seen unprecedented increases. However, because of the current situation in the Northeast, these firms cannot use their deposits in the Northeast and dare not store various types of paper money from the Northeast. Therefore, they transfer the deposits they have absorbed to Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places to ensure the safety of the depositors and to meet the needs of remittances or cash for the farmers from Zhili, Shandong, and Henan provinces returning home in winter. These silver firms cannot but take on the responsibility of regulating. A look at the sharp rise and special rise in the exchange rate between the Northeast and Shanghai and Tianjin can reveal a rough idea. With such a large amount of cash needed, they have to transport cash to supply it. However, this cash is ultimately brought back to their original home by the farmers from other provinces, so in reality, it will not remain in the Northeast.</p>
<p>4. The market in the Northeast has always traded in various non-convertible paper currencies and does not require cash. Recently, the pseudo-state unified the currency system, and the Japanese implemented an economic monopoly by exchanging various non-convertible paper currencies for paper money from the Central Bank of Manchuria, almost making the paper money of the Central Bank of Manchuria the legal currency for transactions. The Japanese only need to exchange gold tickets for paper money from the Central Bank of Manchuria or specie (Yokohama Specie Bank notes) or various types of paper money that have not yet been withdrawn to buy soybeans, and there is no need to rely on cash. However, Chinese-owned silver firms and banks, struggling in a harsh environment, cannot but prepare for withdrawals and encashment.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the Japanese are implementing a policy of economic monopoly in the Northeast more and more every day. The paper money wages that our farmers have earned through hard work throughout the year cannot be brought back to their original homes for use, so they have no choice but to entrust the silver firms to remit them back. If their hometown is a place that cannot be remitted by silver firms and there is no post office to remit, then they can only exchange it for cash and bring it back. If the Chinese silver firms in the Northeast do not transport cash to provide for their needs, wouldn't they be sitting idly by while these millions of people are stranded in the Northeast and become starving people? However, the Japanese certainly hope that these millions of compatriots have money but cannot remit it back and instead hoard the paper money of the Central Bank of Manchuria to celebrate the success of their plan.</p>
<h3 id="e165">The Soviet Banking System Translated by Wu Hongshou <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet State Bank has recently completed ten years of successful operation. The Soviet State Bank is the only issuing bank and central credit institution in the country, so it is a major factor in improving the national economy. In addition, the State Bank has special and important tasks for the production of a stable currency system, the development of industry and commerce, and the implementation of the economic policies of social construction.</p>
<p>The establishment of the State Bank in 1921 and the special franchise for the issuance of gold-backed banknotes (Chervontzi) in 1922 were preliminary steps in implementing the construction of a stable currency system and concentrating capital. The initial capital accumulation did not include depreciated banknotes. On May 1, 1932, the State Bank's integrated reserve included gold, platinum, and fixed foreign currency valued at 722.8 (million units) rubles (equivalent to more than 37 million US dollars). On the same date, the bank's capital and surplus totaled 576,300,000 rubles (equivalent to more than 29.6 million US dollars), a six-fold increase compared to October 1, 1924. The State Bank's assets have increased rapidly, from 155 million rubles on October 1, 1922, to 18 trillion rubles (equivalent to 9.4 trillion US dollars) on May 1, 1932. The average monthly circulation this year has reached 5.5 trillion rubles, far exceeding the 100 million rubles from 1922 to 1923. Branches are spread throughout the country, and now more than 2,700 institutions have been established.</p>
<p>▲The Soviet Bank's Task for Economic Policy▲</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has no private banks. All private banks were nationalized in December 1917. Therefore, this bank became an indispensable part of the policy, jointly proceeding to achieve its common goal, which is to support and implement economic policies. This bank has an important task for concentrating and redistributing national benefits. The main parties of the Soviet Bank are the various organizations and businesses in the national economy.</p>
<p>The only feature of the Soviet banking system is the division of short-term lending and long-term lending operations. This approach has been gradually implemented. Since its inception, short-term lending has been largely concentrated in the State Bank. After the reform of 1930, the State Bank became the only source of short-term lending. The State Bank also operates some long-term lending, especially in agriculture. By May 1932, all long-term lending was allocated to four designated banks.</p>
<p>▲The Development of the State Bank▲</p>
<p>The development of the State Bank over the past decade is a reflection of the development of the national economy. When the State Bank was first established, it was after the adoption of the New Economic Policy. The level of the domestic economy was extremely low due to the results of the world and domestic wars. Industrial production only reached 20% of the pre-war level, agricultural production was less than 50%, and the transportation industry was almost completely bankrupt. This newly established State Bank took on the important task of restoring industry, agriculture, and the organization of domestic commerce. During this period, the main tasks of the State Bank, in addition to establishing a stable currency and credit system, were to cultivate the development of socialized industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Due to the surge in its sources, the State Bank was able to expand its lending operations to meet the needs of the rapidly developing industrial and commercial business operations. The State Bank's lending to various national economies increased from 525 (million) rubles on October 1, 1924, to 2.9 trillion rubles (October 1, 1928), and then to 5.4 trillion rubles (May 1, 1932). This number is distributed among the following major businesses:</p>
<p>(Million Rubles) (Percentage)</p>
<p>Domestic Supply and State-Owned Enterprises 1519.4 28.1</p>
<p>Agriculture 708.2 13.1</p>
<p>Heavy Industry 674.1 12.5</p>
<p>Consumer Cooperative 659.0 12.2</p>
<p>Timber Industry 57.19 10.6</p>
<p>Light Industry 554.1 10.3</p>
<p>Production Cooperative 114.6 2.1</p>
<p>The State Bank also manages all of the Soviet Union's large foreign trade. All Soviet foreign trade receipts and expenditures are handled by the State Bank. Payments are made by branches around the world. The Soviet Union's centralized and planned management of foreign payments is very reliable. Since the period when the Soviet Union established trade relations with foreign countries, there has never been a single unreliable payment.</p>
<p>The Soviet State Bank is governed by two parts: the Council and the Board of Directors. The Soviet Minister of Finance is the Chairman of the Council. The Council meets at least twice a year to set out the business outline and appoint directors. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Minister of Civil Affairs.</p>
<p>The steady and rapid development of industrial and commercial production and the gradual concentration of all major production and commerce in the hands of socialization have enabled the State Bank and the Soviet currency system to increase their financial stability. Due to various new developments, the credit system had to undergo a reform, because the credit system before 1930 was mainly based on bills of exchange.</p>
<p>▲Reform of the Credit System▲</p>
<p>The credit reform of January 1930 stipulated the abolition of all old-style commercial credit and replaced it with direct bank credit. Domestic and cooperative enterprises are therefore no longer allowed to supply goods or services to each other on credit. Therefore, the State Bank became the sole short-term lending institution. This lending is provided to buyers, not to sellers in the form of bill discounting.</p>
<p>Subsequently, due to the discovery of certain weaknesses and distortions in the credit reform regulations, supplementary decrees were promulgated in 1931 (January, March, June). The implementation of these decrees was able to eliminate the mechanical state of previous transactions, focus on the importance of contracts between buyers and sellers, determine the task of the State Bank, guarantee the main conditions of bank credit, and make the approval of lending based on economic or production plans and the implementation of timely repayment. These decrees have proven well in consolidating economic accounting, tightening business cycles, increasing the interest of economic organizations in rationalizing production, reducing costs, accumulating surpluses, and improving credit discipline in the past.</p>
<p>▲Long-Term Credit Bank▲</p>
<p>The State Bank occupies a prominent position in the Soviet banking system and is the only issuing and short-term credit institution. However, in addition, the long-term credit bank also undertakes a most important function, which is to regulate construction capital.</p>
<p>The allocation of construction capital has increased frequently in recent years. The total number for this year is 24.2 trillion rubles. Under this circumstance, the most important thing is to urge each design to be absolutely responsible for the implementation of the plan within its specified time frame and to reduce its costs. In order to make the system of regulating construction funds (giving loans based on the actual implementation of the design) more precise and to expand the economic accounting of construction projects, a decree was announced on May 5, 1932 to reorganize the organization of long-term credit. The decree centralized all long-term credit operations into four types of banks, each bank taking on the task of regulating the fixed construction capital in the national economy.</p>
<p>The first bank is the Industrial Bank (Proinbank), which focuses on regulating state-owned domestic and foreign enterprises belonging to the management of heavy industry, light industry, timber industry, supply industry, and foreign trade, and belonging to the Labor Arbitration Committee. The second is the Agricultural Bank (Selkhozbank), which specializes in regulating the investment capital of all state-owned farms, transportation industries, and joint farms. The third is the Cooperative Bank (Yeskcbank), which specializes in regulating the construction funds of all cooperative organizations (excluding family cooperatives). The fourth is the Municipal Bank (Tsekombank), which specializes in regulating municipal public utilities, the construction of dormitories, and the establishment of new cities. All three banks other than the Cooperative Bank circulate with non-refundable subsidies and long-term loans. The Cooperative Bank only has long-term loans.</p>
<p>A large amount of construction funds for industry and electricity are non-refundable loans. The majority of these loans are provided by the government treasury. However, all industrial organizations must pay a portion of their surplus into the bank. Therefore, when many factories and power plants are established, the surplus paid by each factory will also increase, and the loans in the treasury budget will decrease accordingly.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the Industrial and Commercial Bank, which operates long-term lending, has established 32 branches and has representatives stationed in most branches of the State Bank. In order to have adequate contact with the actual construction plan, each branch is established in the area where most of the construction is carried out. As a result of direct management and the strict accounting of engineering supply agencies by bank agencies, there is considerable encouragement for the economy.</p>
<p>In addition to the State Bank and long-term lending banks regulating the national economy, there are also savings banks spread throughout the country. At the beginning of this year, the total amount of their deposits has exceeded 1 trillion rubles.</p>
<p>The steady operation of Soviet economic development and its perfect lending system (this system is the most important element in the entire economic plan) enable the Soviet banking system to be in a stable position and have been able to avoid inflexibility. Another reason for the stability of the Soviet banking system and currency system is the balance of the government's annual budget without any shortages.</p>
<p>The Soviet financial budget is based on meeting economic needs. Therefore, of the total expenditure of 20.4 trillion rubles in 1932, 15.3 trillion, or 75%, was used to regulate the national economy (industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, post, and telegraph and other industries). Only 1.5 trillion rubles, or 7.5%, was used for national defense and management.</p>
<p>The main source of tax revenue for the Soviet financial budget is the socialized national economy. In addition to this, only a small portion is taxed by the people. There are two types of payments from the socialized part: a portion of the surplus of state-owned enterprises and the Business Turnover Tax. Changes in tax rates affect prices. Because prices must be restricted by the government, the Business Turnover Tax is not taken from the people. In 1931, the tax revenue from the socialized part was 15.9 trillion rubles, which is 77.6% of the total tax revenue. The tax revenue from the people was 2.9 trillion rubles, only 14%.</p>
<p>Although the government's financial system has a relatively stable foundation, the rapid progress of Soviet industry does not reduce the bank's heavy responsibilities in the future. In fact, with the increase in national economic resources, it is even more important for Soviet banks to allocate these resources and redistribute them to further the development of the country and the happiness of the people.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Conversion Method of Chinese and Foreign Wheat Prices <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zongpei</p>
<p>Modern commerce is becoming increasingly internationalized, and the prices of various major commodities mostly fluctuate with the international market. Shanghai is an important commercial market in China and one of the world's major trading ports. Therefore, domestic and foreign market prices are interrelated. However, due to the differences in weights and measures and the differences in monetary units, there is a conversion between prices according to different countries. This type of conversion is difficult for outsiders to understand. This article is a draft of the algorithm based on the investigation of non-professionals. I hope that experts in the industry will point out the errors. This publication welcomes such discussion and research manuscripts and hopes that they will continue to benefit readers. Sincerely, the editor notes that in the recent ten years or so, various parts of our country have suffered from natural disasters and man-made disasters, and the people have been unable to make a living. The rural economy has collapsed, farmers have left their hometowns, and the land has been abandoned. Production has been reduced. The output is quite abundant, and the export of wheat, which has been sold overseas in the past, has also decreased year by year. The import of foreign wheat has increased with the years. In recent years, the raw material supply of various flour mills has also relied on foreign wheat. This is because the quality of foreign wheat is better than that of domestic wheat, and better records can be obtained for flour production. Therefore, it is favored by various flour mills, causing a reversal of the guest-host relationship.</p>
<p>Foreign wheat occupies an important position in the Chinese market today. The varieties of imported wheat are mainly Australian wheat, Canadian wheat, and American wheat. Therefore, the harvest yields and price increases and decreases in these places are sufficient to affect the Shanghai wheat market, and the conversion method of Chinese and foreign wheat prices has become the focus of research for manufacturers and speculators.</p>
<p>The difference between Chinese and foreign wheat prices lies in the difference between the quotation unit and the standard currency. The standard wheat of the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Exchange must weigh between 139 jin and 140 jin to be qualified for trading. The trading unit is "vehicle," and each vehicle is about 880 jin. The market price is calculated by "dan" (100 jin). For example, the recent market price is about 3 liang and 4 qian per dan. The market price of foreign wheat, with North America as the center, is said to be based on Australian wheat as the selling standard in Canada, while American wheat is concentrated in Chicago. The market price is calculated by "bushel" and the standard currency is US dollars. For example, the recent market price is about 50 US cents per "bushel."</p>
<p>Because of the different calculation units and gold and silver standard currencies in the Chinese and foreign wheat markets, there is a common conversion simplification method in the flour and wheat industry. According to people in the industry, the foreign wheat market price is converted to the Shanghai market price. First, "33" is used to divide the price per bushel. The quotient is then divided by the US exchange rate to obtain the Shanghai yuan equivalent of each stone of foreign wheat. If you want to convert it into the price per dan, you only need to divide it by 139 or 140. The formula is as follows:</p>
<p>(Foreign wheat price ÷ 33) ÷ US exchange rate ÷ 140 = Shanghai yuan equivalent of the price per dan of Australian wheat... (1)</p>
<p>For example, on October 17, the Canadian telegram reported that October wheat was valued at 48 and 1/8 US cents per bushel. Assuming that the US exchange rate on that day was 30 and 5/16 US dollars per 100 Shanghai yuan, then the market price per dan of Canadian wheat would be equivalent to 3 liang, 4 qian, 3 fen, and 6 li of Shanghai silver. The formula is as follows:</p>
<p>(48.125 US dollars ÷ 33 shi) ÷ 30.3125/100 US dollars ÷ 1.40 dan = 3.436 liang of Shanghai yuan</p>
<p>The thing that should be paid attention to in the first formula is "Divide the foreign wheat market price by "33"". This "33" should be 1.33 shi or 3.3 dou, because the US volume is 3.4031251 dou or 0.34031251 shi per bushel. The industry custom abandons the more accurate "0.34" and uses "0.33" to divide the foreign wheat market price, which is actually incomprehensible. It is speculated that it is easier to remember and calculate when dividing by "33". Therefore, it seems that the result may be more accurate if "34" is used to divide. It is perplexing that the industry custom abandons the more precise "·34" and uses "·33" to divide the foreign wheat market price.</p>
<p>Dividing the foreign wheat market price by "·33" or "·34" obtains the US dollar equivalent of the foreign wheat price per dan.</p>
<p>(Australian foreign wheat market price ÷ .33) = (.48125 ÷ .33) = 1.458 US dollars</p>
<p>Then, divide the US dollar equivalent of the foreign wheat price per dan by the US exchange rate to obtain the Shanghai yuan equivalent of the foreign wheat price per dan as follows:</p>
<p>(1.458 US dollars ÷ 30.125/100) = 4.811 Shanghai yuan liang (the Shanghai yuan equivalent of the price per shi of foreign wheat)</p>
<p>If you want to compare it with Chinese wheat, you still need to divide it by "139" or "140" to convert it into the Shanghai yuan equivalent of the foreign wheat price per dan as follows:</p>
<p>(4.811 Shanghai yuan liang ÷ 1.40 dan) = 3.436 Shanghai yuan liang (the price per dan)</p>
<p>Furthermore, if "·34" is substituted for "·33" in the first formula, the result will be smaller than the former. The new formula is as follows:</p>
<p>(Foreign wheat price ÷ 34 shi) ÷ US exchange rate ÷ 1.40 dan = Shanghai yuan equivalent of the foreign wheat price per but... (2)</p>
<p>Now, let's include the example of October 17 for calculation:</p>
<p>(.48125 US dollars ÷ .34 shi) ÷ 30.3125/100 US dollars ÷ 1.40 dan = 3.335 Shanghai yuan liang</p>
<p>Compared with the two, the latter is calculated to be 1 qian and 1 li of Shanghai silver less than the former. It seems that the calculation is better than the former, and the theory that foreign wheat can be 1 or 2 qian more expensive than Chinese wheat seems to have a considerable relationship with the inaccuracy of the calculation.</p>

<h3 id="e167">New Wedding Night (4) <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Miss Xiu’s eyes were so swollen she couldn’t open them. She curled up her legs to her stomach, completely like a shrimp, tightly shrinking and not daring to move even slightly, afraid of waking up that ugly and loathsome old monkey – the honorable title she had given him – whom she had never encountered even in her dreams. Thinking of the events of last night, she couldn’t help but tremble again, and the area around her eyes became moist again. Two cold tears rolled down her cheeks, stopping on her tender chin.</p>
<p>“Oh, yesterday I used all the strength of my life to resist, so I was able to hold on until today. I am still myself, my own soul, my own body, my own ego – but what about tonight? I have no strength left, my right hand is seriously injured and can barely move. Oh, Heaven, what am I going to do?</p>
<p>Aunt is too unreasonable. She is still a woman who understands poetry, books, and etiquette, and her sons are all working outside. Why would she do such a heartless and inhumane thing? Marrying me off to such a hideous man, the ugliest man in the world, is more painful and torturous than cutting off my head or slicing off my flesh piece by piece. Humph, matchmaker, what a bloodless murderer. Her own daughters run off to marry freely, so why does she control me and plot against me?</p>
<p>Mother is too pitiful, she has cried countless times for me, I cannot blame her. Father is too cruel, may Buddha punish him, and when I become a ghost, I will take revenge. He is too heartless, how could he marry me to such a person….”</p>
<p>Floating in Miss Xiu’s mind, apart from resentment, grief, sadness, and disappointment, was the hideous face of that terrifying old monkey. Moreover, the impression of that face seemed to be glued on with lacquer, never to be removed. “Oh, you’re awake! Don’t cry anymore, it’s unseemly for others to hear. Tonight we can have a good time…”</p>
<p>Heavens, it turned out that the hideous, terrifying monkey face had already come to Miss Xiu’s side. She was so frightened that she almost screamed, but suddenly she heard whispering voices from next door, so she had to endure it and turn her face inward.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the opportunity to go to the toilet, Miss Xiu, with her hair disheveled, ran to the house of her matchmaker – her aunt. Originally, she had just arrived yesterday at this large courtyard of over a hundred households in Youzhachong, and did not know where her aunt lived, only that it was not far from her. When she quietly walked out of the back door, she saw a cowherd. After she asked for directions, she ran frantically. The child thought she was a guest, because her appearance was so different from yesterday.</p>
<p>Baoying Garden suddenly became lively: neighbors from near and far, both men and women, old and young, all ran to see this beautiful and strange bride.</p>
<p>"Quickly go inside, close the door, it's so embarrassing to have so many people watching."</p>
<p>Aunt was so angry that her face turned ashen. She felt that Miss Xiu was too disrespectful to her, not only because she was her niece, but also because she was the matchmaker herself.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Scolding <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>When joy reaches its peak, one "unconsciously moves one's hands and feet" – the natural expression of true feelings is indeed so uncontrollable. At the same time, if the stimulation that the outside world gives people is too deep, then the strong reaction evoked by the stimulation will also make people uncontrollably stomp their feet and beat their chests, forcing them to scold.</p>
<p>But in the eyes of hypocrites, scolding is extremely barbaric. Although they go against their conscience and do many bad things to harm others and benefit themselves, on the surface they are full of sweet words, trying not to reveal a trace. If anyone wants to complain or vent the accumulated anger in their heart, no matter how frank and straightforward they are, they will always strongly oppose it, no, severely interfere. In this era, the authority of hypocrites is high above others, so people's true feelings are often covered up by fierce flames.</p>
<p>In fact, the R-B-S reaction formula has absolutely no exceptions. We coldly observe that since there are injustices everywhere, there are things that deserve to be scolded everywhere. The so-called scolding, as long as it is serious criticism and fearless resistance, then the extension of justice may begin from this. Like now, some are tyrannical, some are昏淫無道, some brothers are quarreling, some are shamelessly betraying their principles, some are falling and committing suicide, and so on, even to the point of selling their daughters for glory and recognizing enemies as fathers; there are so many strange shapes and forms that it is simply countless – frankly speaking, who does not deserve to be scolded severely? As a joke, if we want to meet the demand, we should quickly set up several crash courses in scolding, which would not be too much.</p>
<p>The more you fear scolding, the more ugly things there are for people to scold, and the more you can't help but scold. If you don't want people to scold, unless you are willing to wash your heart and renew your life, break out of the dark encirclement, and move forward towards the bright path.</p>
<p>To think more about the people who scold, it's not good to say "laugh and scold as I please," so just casually and slowly scold, being afraid of scolding when it comes to scolding, or even scolding first and then not scolding. Mi Heng beat the drum and scolded Cao, his voice and expression were fierce, and he would rather die than yield. This is the spirit worth emulating! Otherwise, even if you are brave enough to scold everywhere, scolding people to the point of no return, it is still thousands of miles away from the natural expression of true feelings.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Now they have moved to live in Hong Kong. Your sister scolds the Guangzhou authorities every day. What she says is very funny. She says that my brother's embezzlement of public funds was instructed by the authorities. Otherwise, how would he dare to be so bold? Once someone reports him, they will push the responsibility onto my brother. I think it's fortunate. When will there be an end to corrupt officials?</p>
<p>"I've said too much, I'll write again later. Goodbye. Let me say, I am your Peizhu, respectfully. November 10."</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Liu Peizhu's sister, Peizhen, is the second daughter-in-law of the well-known compradore-class Ren Qiming in Shanghai. Her husband, Ren Jinhua, is the most fashionable talent in modern China – a Master of Economics from Harvard University in the United States. He is currently a first-class counselor in the Ministry of Finance, only going to Beijing once a month to collect his salary. The rest of the time he spends leisurely in Shanghai. The most time he spends is at dance halls, followed by playing mahjong. When Haiquan set off from Guangzhou to Shanghai, his sister told him that Liu Peizhen lived at No. 45, H Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession of Shanghai, and asked him to bring some southern food and tea to Shanghai as a courtesy when visiting the Ren family.</p>
<p>"Can't you buy anything in Shanghai? Asking him to bring these boring things is annoying, isn't it?" It was still his brother-in-law, Liu Weiying, who understood people and expressed what Haiquan wanted to say first. "What you buy in Shanghai is what you buy in Shanghai. Ours is ours. What do you know? The gift is light, but the sentiment is heavy." His sister smiled and scolded her husband. The brother-in-law then walked away with a smile. Haiquan immediately thought that China was finished. Because the Chinese nation – especially the male compatriots – are too unprogressive and too unambitious. On weekdays, those big and small revolutionary heroes who grind their fists and palms and talk about revolution until their faces are red and their foreheads are bulging, kneel down and soften in front of women, abandoning their former positions and losing their former ambitions. Look at the great men of China today, which one is not controlled by their wives? – not afraid of their wives, then afraid of their concubines, not afraid of their concubines, then afraid of their mistresses. In the end, all matters of state are decided by one or two ignorant women. How can the world not be finished?</p>
<p>After Haiquan arrived in Shanghai, he was very unwilling to visit those people who obviously had class distinctions in material enjoyment. He knew that a certain foreign firm was the Ren family's liaison office, so he attached his name card to the food that his sister asked him to bring and gave it to the foreign firm to forward. He only made excuses that he would visit them after clarifying the matters of the school.</p>
<p>Probably his brother-in-law and Peizhu had both sent letters to Peizhen. Haiquan indirectly heard from Mr. Zeng that the Ren family on Avenue Joffre hoped that he would come to their house to play. So he felt that he was too neurotic and too arrogant, and was a bit unfair to the Ren family. At the same time, he also received a letter from his sister, scolding him for not visiting those relatives for a long time, which was too impolite.</p>
<p>Helpless, one Sunday morning, he decided to take a trip to the Ren family. He had heard people say that when visiting friends in Shanghai, it is best to do so around ten or eleven in the morning, because they are usually not at home in the afternoon and evening.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Woman… <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Wen</p>
<p>Under the character for "woman," although there is usually a character for "person" or "child," just like under the character for "man," the men rarely consider the women to be the same as themselves, as "people" or "children." When Russia still had an emperor, they had a saying that "a hen is not a bird, and a woman is not a person." Our own "Great Accomplished Sage" also sighed, "Only women and petty men are difficult to raise!" Today, the women of Russia, which no longer has an emperor, according to people who have observed the new Russia, have not only become "people," but also have a tendency to surpass men; but in China, women are still difficult to raise; on the contrary, they are considered easy to raise, and are played with, and even played with to the extreme, nothing can be added.</p>
<p>Those who consider women difficult to raise are always friends who are not very financially well-off. They see others marrying a wife, although they have spent a lot of betrothal money, and they are still unwilling to get into the sedan chair happily, which is already frightening. Even when they see an advertisement for a pair of women's silk stockings in the glass window of a department store, selling for only eighteen yuan at a cheap price, they are sure to be stunned.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it seems that anyone can afford to raise a woman. If we flip through a daily newspaper, the advertisements for women's products are of course drawn with beautiful women "with charming smiles"; even the advertisements for medicines specially for depraved men to inject or take are mostly modern girls "with beautiful eyes"; the hand in the cigarette advertisement holding that "golden tobacco silk" and "reasonable price" cigarette will always be a jade-like slender hand; the picture in the advertisement for medicine for corns is also of a beauty with her jade toes raised. Even a long, rectangular eyebrow painting in the supplement of the newspaper, nine times out of ten, has to rely on a fashionable woman, as if inviting contributors, saying: This magazine specially hires women to entertain. As for illustrated magazines, without female high school graduates, the editors would naturally be disappointed, and the readers would probably not be able to enjoy it with relish... In short, although a woman is nominally a "person," she is actually a "thing"!</p>
<p>So what should be done? It's easy, that is, women only need to regard themselves as "people," and men should not regard them as "things." As for the benefits after both men and women regard each other as "people"? At least the tragic and ugly dramas between the sexes that are specially supplied to social news can be reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e171">The World's Tallest Building – The Skyscraper <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong</p>
<p>"What is the tallest building in the world?" If anyone asks this.</p>
<p>"Of course, it's New York's Woolworth Building!" I think you must answer this way. However, in fact, this is not the case. The glory of the Woolworth Building has long become a dream of the past, and the current tallest building is the Empire State Building, known as the Skyscraper.</p>
<p>This building was completed in May last year, is eighty-five stories high, and has 20,000 residents, almost equal to the population of a small city.</p>
<p>So where is this Skyscraper? Of course, it's in New York. Originally, tall buildings were a specialty of New York. According to recent statistics, there are 377 buildings with more than 20 floors in the United States, and New York accounts for half of them. So this tall building is in New York again, which is not surprising at all.</p>
<p>Now let me briefly introduce this Empire State Building. The roof of this Skyscraper has an airship mooring station, which is an unprecedented innovation in the world. Because it is too high, there must be high-speed elevators. Otherwise, even if you transport a small item from the bottom to the top floor, you will have to walk until dark. So there must be an elevator that can go up to sixty floors in one minute.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the aforementioned Woolworth Building was indeed the darling of the world, with fifty-eight floors, about seven and a half times the size of Tokyo's "Marunouchi" in Japan. But three years ago, the Manhattan Bank Building with sixty-five floors and the Chrysler Building with sixty-eight floors suddenly appeared, so the Woolworth Building was no longer a darling. When this Skyscraper was born last year, it fell directly to fourth place.</p>
<p>As for the reason for the appearance of this Skyscraper, it is of course inevitable that real estate entrepreneurs are competing, because tall buildings are easy to promote and easy to rent out. Moreover, Americans have a desire to create "the world's first." For example, if someone in a certain place has a tall building, "Okay, I will definitely not admit defeat, even if I borrow money, I will build one." So this tall building was produced in this competitive spirit. However, this is ultimately one aspect of observation. The fundamental reason is that the United States is a land of gold. "As long as you have money, you can do anything." This saying is the real reason for the appearance of the Skyscraper.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Swiss Girl <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Ju</p>
<p>The French philosopher Pascal once said: From the point of view of behavior, good and evil are different problems depending on the place. In other words, human behavior is regional. What is called evil here is called beauty there. In this place, a certain behavior is ridiculous to the general public, but in that place, it is praised by the general public. Indeed, the so-called "custom" is a very incredible and very interesting thing. Stendhal has a work called "On Love," in which he describes the customs of the girls in the Berne area of Switzerland, which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>The behavior of Swiss women in their youth is romantic and innocent; and the families there also have a special attitude towards this behavior. It is said that a famous French officer once had to spend the night in a very remote and beautiful valley in Oberland due to mountain climbing. After arriving in the mountains, he stayed at the home of an official in the valley, who was the richest and most powerful person in the area. When this guest entered, he noticed a very charming girl of sixteen. This girl was the daughter of the host. That night, there happened to be a village dance party; because this girl was so beautiful and moving, the officer could not help but try to get close to her and flatter her. Finally, he mustered up the courage to ask her if he could sneak into her room at night. The girl replied: "No, I sleep with my cousin; but I can come to your room at night." After dinner, the traveler stood up. The beautiful girl took a lamp and led him to his room; seeing this situation, he thought that he could enjoy some pleasure tonight.</p>
<p>But this girl said with an innocent and romantic look: "No, I should ask my mother's permission first." This sentence was like a bolt from the blue, scaring the soul out of him, but before he could stop her, she had already gone out; the officer had no choice but to embolden himself and follow her, lurking outside the living room built of wooden boards to eavesdrop on what they were saying. He heard the girl coquettishly asking her mother to allow her what she hoped for; as a result, she achieved her goal. The old woman said to her husband, who was already lying on the bed: "Old man, don't you agree to allow Torini to spend the night with that officer?" "I am very willing," her old husband replied; "like this kind of person, I would be willing to lend him my woman to spend the night." Then the old woman said to Torini: "Well, go! But be brave, don't take off your skirt..."</p>
<p>At dawn, the girl got up from the guest's bed, she was still pure and flawless. The traveler respected her wishes that night and did not force her to do what she considered excessive. She tidied up the bedding and made coffee and milk to bring to the officer. Then she sat on the bed and had breakfast with him. After breakfast, she cut a piece of her corset covering her breasts and gave it to him, saying: "Keep this as a souvenir of this happy night! I will never forget this night..." So, she gave the officer one last kiss and fled like a startled swan, and he never saw her again.</p>

<p>It is said that in ancient China there was Lao Tzu, who had white hair and beard before he was born from his mother's womb, which may be completely credible; otherwise, why are there so many young people now who are so old and irresistible before they even leave school?</p>
<p>Their entire lives: eating, sleeping, wearing clothes; their lifelong plans: becoming officials, getting rich, marrying wives.</p>
<p>Our society is such an old society, and our youth is such an old youth; what is said about "catching up with the evolution of the world" is really dreaming with your eyes open – just wait and see people's "table dancing"!</p>

<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has been using a challenging attitude towards the world's powers everywhere, and the emotions are very bad, which will inevitably lead to a second world war. Therefore, it is actively preparing for war. After all, Japan is small and sparsely populated, and cannot withstand a single gamble. Therefore, the Tokyo Higher Girls' School Principals' Conference resolved to arm 35,000 female students in Tokyo and subject them to rigorous military training. It is heard that the Ministry of the Army is very supportive and has agreed to allocate 35,000 rifles, as well as pistols, poison gas defense equipment, etc., and start training from next spring. From then on, a large number of women soldiers will appear on the world stage.</p>
<p>Any militaristic country, although it has a system of universal conscription, the conscription only extends to men, and there is no news of women. Even the heroes who participate in the war mostly volunteer to fight bravely, and are not passively forced into the army. Now that Japan is forcing women to receive military training, and extending it further, men who are only ten years old can also be forced to go to the front line as sacrificial livestock. The situation after that is that the humans produced by the Creator are nothing more than targets for artillery fire and bombs. Please be aware, please understand, the so-called Nine-Power Treaty, Washington Conference, Disarmament Conference, etc., don't go to build empty shelves and put on a华容道anymore, tear down the peepshow, everyone desperately creates some citizens to be the sacrifices of the warlords.</p>
<p>Or say, no, "Japan's training of women soldiers has another special and wonderful use. Japan has always been famous for its good use of the beauty trap. Don't you see that when the investigation team went to Japan this time, no matter what meetings or banquets were held, they selected beautiful women to participate in the welcome. Assuming that once a war breaks out, driving five or six thousand娇艶and charming women to the front to fight, I ask, would the enemy still have the heart to use airplanes and artillery to carry out the means of煑鶴焚琴? It's really an excellent beauty trap.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Feelings on Passing Baolong Mountain <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Yesterday I met Jishi, who showed me his recent work, "Feelings on Passing Baolong Mountain," in the form of five-character ancient poems. Touched by the scenery, he couldn't help but look back. I will transcribe it as follows to fill this magazine.</p>
<p>In the past, when I traveled to Long Mountain, I saw the mountain colors and was very happy. I competed to be the first with my cane, forgetting the distance when climbing. The dangerous pavilion was like the round mountain, and the wild flowers reminded me of fragrant orchids. Now I pass this mountain again, and the mood is as light as water. How could the mountain have changed its appearance? It is all due to the endless chaos. Women and children leave their fields, and half of their neighbors die. Yesterday, when I passed Lotus City, my eyes were full of scars. The sick bones lay in the stone fields, and the鳩形called out. Feeling this, my tears wet my lap, crisscrossing and unstoppable. I cannot enjoy the wine, and I do not see the beauty of the flowers. Because I know that bitterness and joy are all in people's minds.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Sunday <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Lou</p>
<p>Is this also considered a new trick?</p>
<p>The arrival of Sunday, for me, who is extremely poor, (with a fake satin robe from 1929 inside and a cloth shirt from 1932 outside, the length is compared, more stylish than the long robes and shorts of modern girls,) is of course commonplace, and I will never be like those modern young people, busy planning how to spend the day.</p>
<p>Last Sunday was an exception. It was probably around 4 o'clock in the afternoon when my old friend Mr. L, whom I hadn't seen for months, suddenly came to me. After a long separation, he invited me to go to the movies with him. At first, I declined on the grounds that I was busy with my studies, but in the end, I couldn't resist his kindness, so I pulled up my sleeves and went out with him.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the entrance of the N Theater, it was exactly 5:32. We were one step late, so we had to taste the door being closed. Just as we were unwilling to advance or retreat, someone suddenly said that he had a ticket for sale. I looked at the ticket and couldn't help but laugh, because the ticket was only half of one, and there was no "Pass" mark left on it. Unexpectedly, he thought our clothes were antiques and tried to cheat us. Finally, he also said that if the ticket was invalid, he could have his head cut off. At the same time, he blew his right hand toward his neck. I couldn't help but say to him humorously: "Keep your head! Throw your head to the Northeast, then it would not be a waste for your head to be on your neck." Royalties are donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army</p>

<p>— I</p>
<p>Dearest Juhua,</p>
<p>Do you know how empty I feel at this moment! When you are not by my side again.</p>
<p>Empty sky, empty room, empty mood, ah! Everything is empty, so empty that it frightens me, dear Ju sister! Where are you now? Why haven't you come yet? Can you bear to let me die of emptiness?</p>
<p>My beloved, I am waiting for you, waiting for you to warm my heart, waiting for you to kiss away my tears.</p>
<p>Your poor Zilang, 9:10 AM on the 11th.</p>
<p>My darling:</p>
<p>How happy I am, so happy that words cannot describe it. Isn't it? What I have been pursuing all my life is you. Now you are mine, and will always be mine. I have gotten my darling, so why shouldn't I be happy? Is there anything happier than this in the world?</p>
<p>Darling! My darling! My fiancée!</p>
<p>I will always savor the happiest scene of last night, when you stretched out your hand and nestled in my arms, letting me put the ring on your finger.</p>
<p>Your fiancé, morning of the 12th.</p>
<p>My dear:</p>
<p>I bet you are lying in bed with a flushed face, gazing at my photo, imagining our future happiness, aren't you?</p>
<p>That's right, we should work harder to get closer to happiness, while we are young. Please don't forget our appointment at 3 pm tomorrow. Now let me send you a passionate postal kiss.</p>
<p>Yours, evening of the 13th.</p>
<p>My sweetheart:</p>
<p>As soon as I think of the scene yesterday afternoon, my heart keeps pounding. Ah! Your body temperature, your red lips, your…</p>
<p>Happiness, happiness, the highest happiness in life!</p>
<p>I hope to have such an opportunity again. No, a hundred times, a thousand times, even ten thousand times.</p>
<p>The one in your heart, the night of the 14th, before going to bed. By the way, your request is very right, we should get married right away. But I think after we get married, we may not have such happiness as we have now, right? Dear, I wish we could maintain our current relationship for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Forever loving you, Zilang, the 16th.</p>
<p>Ju sister:</p>
<p>Hey! Why are you always unwilling to believe me? Do I have the slightest bit of falsehood towards you? Only heaven knows!</p>
<p>Aren't you coming today? Zilang, the 18th.</p>
<p>Ju sister:</p>
<p>You are so selfish, you always treat me as the worst person in the world. I really don't understand what you mean.</p>
<p>You should come once, I am waiting for you in ×× Hotel, I have a lot to say to you.</p>
<p>Zilang, the 21st.</p>
<p>Juhua:</p>
<p>This is the last word: please answer me earnestly.</p>
<p>You are too unforgiving of me, you must get married when it is impossible to get married, isn't this intentionally wounding people's happiness? I am extremely opposed to such a forced union.</p>
<p>Now I frankly say: we might as well dissolve the engagement, because marriage cannot be carried out under pain. What do you think? Please give me a responsible answer. Wishing you well, Zilang, the 28th.</p>

<h3 id="e178">The Oppression of the Environment <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am an apprentice in a shop, only sixteen years old this year, and have received higher primary school education. Because of difficult family circumstances, I was unable to continue my studies and obtain higher knowledge. This is something I deeply regret every time I think about it!</p>
<p>It was in the spring of last year, after I graduated from school, that I was oppressed by the above-mentioned environment, and with the recommendation of a friend of my father, I came to Shanghai, which is called the "Paris of the East" because of its prosperity, to learn a trade. During this past year, although I have been living a mechanical and meaningless life, sweeping the floor and wiping the counter every day, serving tea and cigarettes to customers, and sometimes running errands for senior staff, my personal life has been temporarily stable. And there is still spare time to read books and newspapers. The manager's treatment of me is not very harsh, which is much more comfortable compared to those in the same position as me in other shops and factories.</p>
<p>However, according to my usual quiet observation, the price of the hard work of the senior apprentices who have just completed their terms is only three yuan per month, or five yuan per month. Even the senior staff members earn at most twenty or thirty yuan. Seeing them supporting their families, I always feel extremely strained, not to mention those gentlemen who like to roam around. Moreover, how easy is it to rise from an apprentice with three to five yuan per month to a senior staff member with twenty to thirty yuan per month in this semi-modern shop? Therefore, looking ahead, I cannot help but feel a chill!</p>
<p>My father is almost fifty years old. Although the family is still supported by my father's efforts, in the near future, this heavy burden will undoubtedly be shifted from my father's shoulders to mine. How can I, who have no ability at all, bear the burden of supporting my parents and raising my younger siblings? Therefore, after deep consideration, I have to prepare to abandon my current career with a bleak future, and want to engage in a more promising career. But how dare I act rashly in the current situation where I don't know what is needed and don't know where to turn!</p>
<p>Recently, I saw various facilities for the 60th anniversary in your newspaper, with a "Clerk Communication" column dedicated to answering difficult questions for the business community in this city. To me, it is like finding a bright lamp in a dark room. I dare not be presumptuous, but with twelve thousand points of enthusiasm, I hope</p>
<p>Sir, please point out a bright road for this young man who is wandering at the crossroads.</p>
<p>Xu Jueren, December 1, in Shanghai</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. Xu's letter aroused our infinite sympathy. Originally, under the current situation of increasingly serious world economic panic, most people are suffering from economic oppression, so you don't have to be discouraged because of this. As for finding a satisfactory job, it is originally a very difficult thing. Moreover, "doing one job and complaining about it" has become a common phenomenon. Those who work with silk and satin envy bank clerks; those who work in the coal industry want to switch to the cloth industry. But wasn't there a common saying in the past that "every profession produces a champion"? This means that as long as you are willing to work hard, there will be a day to stand out. Therefore, we dare not easily agree with Mr. Xu's proposal. If there is a better and more promising career, it is of course better to change to it, but it also depends on your interest in it. If you rashly use the amount of remuneration as the standard for changing careers, then we believe that there will be unimaginable dangers in the future.</p>
<p>Besides, the manager treats you very well, and you have free time to read books and newspapers. Among the current apprentices, as you said, "you can be considered comfortable." Regarding the pursuit of knowledge, if you are determined, it is not a problem. Now, after reading your letter carefully, your writing is very fluent. At the age of sixteen, you have such attainments, which shows that you have put a lot of hard work into reading books and newspapers. We hope that Mr. Xu will continue to work hard, and the future is indeed limitless!</p>
<p>As for your family problems, that is a matter for the future (because your father is only fifty years old). You must know that times are changing rapidly. As long as you can work hard in your studies and be diligent in your duties, waiting for the opportunity to come, it seems that you don't need to worry too much.</p>
<p>Finally, we will cite some examples as stimulants for your efforts. For example, Mr. Shen Jiucheng, the founder of Sanyou Industrial Society, started out making handicrafts weaving pants and clothes straps: Mr. Bi Yuncheng, the director of the Yufeng Yarn Factory office, started out as a typesetter in the Commercial Press: Mr. Yang Sisheng, the founder of the late Pudong Middle School, started out as a mason; Mr. Ye Chengzhong, the school owner of Chengzhong Middle School, started out rowing a sampan: In addition, Mr. Mu Ouchu and Mr. Yu Qiaqing all struggled out of hardship. In the future, if we have time, we plan to introduce the history of the above-mentioned gentlemen to the readers as a model.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>㈢ All Misunderstand</p>
<p>Meng Guobao sat in the quiet environment, only cracking melon seeds and thinking about things. Before he knew it, he had finished the plate of melon seeds. It was probably quite late, and he had heard Sister-in-law Wang Er yawn twice. Knowing that the villagers went to bed early and he shouldn't disturb them from sleeping, lest they become unhappy, he stood up and said, "Old Er, thank you for the tea and melon seeds. I'll come to talk to you tomorrow morning. Will you be home?" Wang Laoer said, "Sure, sure, I'll come back a little earlier for the midday meal." Meng Guobao also said, "Sister-in-law Wang Er, thank you, see you tomorrow." Sister-in-law Wang Er was flustered and couldn't reply with anything else, just stood and smiled, so Meng Guobao went back happily. He had parents, elder brothers and sisters-in-law, and nephews and nieces at home, so it was a big family. His father and elder brothers gave him the money earned from the fields each year to pay for his tuition, hoping that he would become an official in the future and change the family's status. Of course, this money would all come back. Now, although he hadn't become an official, he was a university student. In the past two years, the old gentry in the countryside, those who were graduates of the imperial examinations, were all overthrown. In the past, the graduates of the imperial examinations would judge right and wrong for the villagers and act as witnesses, but now it was all changed to be handled by students who had returned from the provincial capital, Nanjing, Beijing, or Shanghai. In other words, students would act as the rural gentry. As such, Meng Guobao was also a quasi-gentry. Moreover, when Meng Guobao returned, many gentlemen from the Third District of the Shuanglukou Township Autonomous Association were interacting with him. This Third District was a small county government, and Meng Guobao was on good terms with those people, which showed that he was different from the ordinary. Therefore, Meng Guobao's father, Meng Erlaodie, and his elder brothers Guooqi and Guohua, were all very happy. While Guobao was enjoying the cool air on Wang Laoer's threshing ground, Erlaodie went outside the threshing ground to peek several times. None of the family members dared to sleep. When he came back, Erlaodie greeted him at the door and first asked with a smile, "You and Wang Laoer were talking so well, but he's a useless person." Meng Guobao sighed and said, "Alas! He is an oppressed person!" Erlaodie was a person who had read a few old books, so he understood the meaning of these words, and said, "No one is bullying him." Meng Guobao said, "Doesn't he not have his own land, and cultivates other people's land?" Erlaodie said, "That's right! He cultivates one dan of seeds for Mr. Wang Zibin, and one dan and two dou of seeds for Mr. Wang Youdao." Meng Guobao said in a loud voice, "He is a person controlled by big landlords, isn't he an oppressed person?" Erlaodie still didn't quite understand these words. But his son was a university student, and what he said had some reason, so he couldn't refute it anymore, and followed him into the door. Inside the door was a square courtyard, and all the family members were sitting there enjoying the cool air. When he came in, they all stood up. His mother greeted him with a smile and said, "Are you still writing tonight? I've already lit a mosquito coil in your room and put a pot of cool tea on the table." Meng Guobao said, "Oh! There's cool tea on the table? I put a book on economics on the table." His mother said, "A book, it doesn't matter if a little water spills on it, it'll dry in a while." Meng Guobao said, "How can it not matter? That book cost eight yuan." These seemingly unimportant words caused the family to gasp in unison.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Aim of Publishing Shenbao Architecture Special <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Today's world is a world of evolution. Today's academics are specialized academics.</p>
<p>Only when academics tend to specialization can there be evolution. And only when it tends to evolution can it not but excel in what it specializes in. Measuring the world with this, and exploring academics with this, whether it is politics, military affairs, education, or economy, the principle is the same.</p>
<p>Now, everything in the world, commentators say, cannot be outside of economics. To say that architecture is civil engineering, its art is a specialized science, and its effect is within the scope of economics. We in Shanghai, let's just talk about Shanghai. Shanghai is a world-famous commercial port, and especially an important commercial port in East Asia. Its economic relationship with China and even the whole world is self-evident. Therefore, its architectural undertakings are more numerous than in other places. In other words, judging by cause and effect, it may not be impossible to say that the multitude of Shanghai's architecture is what promotes Shanghai's development.</p>
<p>We have been running a daily newspaper for years. Since the daily newspaper evolves with the progress of the world, it should strive for specialization in line with the trend of world academics. The daily newspaper contains</p>
<p>nothing is too far, nothing is left out. In terms of the historical system, it is a general history, a historical material. But in terms of the academic standpoint, it may be incomplete or not specialized in its divisions. The effect is naturally less. This is the difference between the general history and the specialized systematic record. Without fully realizing its strengths or completing its purpose, we have been working tirelessly to improve ourselves to serve our readers.</p>
<p>Recently, in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of this newspaper, we have been working on innovation and at the same time devoting ourselves to specialized academics. We are committed to making this newspaper, in addition to general history and historical materials, also serve as a systematic record for the academic community. In order to seek sequentially and weigh the near and far, this newspaper is based in Shanghai, so we will first take Shanghai as</p>
<h3 id="e183">Metheurst Apartments <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Tong</p>
<p>The owner of the Metheurst Apartments is Hengye Real Estate Co., Ltd., located at the intersection of Metheurst Road and Jing'an Temple Road. The style is very beautiful, designed by New Rehe Foreign Firm. It is the most modern apartment and is now under construction.</p>
<p>the dependence. The prosperity of Shanghai and the development of the architectural industry are the central pivots of industry and commerce, each with its own strengths. Therefore, this newspaper created an architectural special issue as a starting point.</p>
<p>The mission of this publication can be roughly stated as having two ends. One is to arouse public interest in architecture, thereby directly developing the architectural industry and indirectly consolidating the prosperity of Shanghai. The other is to provide faithful and systematic architectural historical materials, and to have experts write and provide strict guidance and criticism, so as to promote the progress of modern architectural undertakings, and to provide a basis for later architectural historians. With these two ends in mind, we will diligently seek and collect various patterns, records, statistics, and news, so as to make this publication a dynamic history in order to adapt to the environment and dedicate ourselves to specialization. We believe that the responsibility lies in what the readers are happy to hear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, architecture as a specialized undertaking is not just about thanking brokers for design. Even materials, such as a brick or a stone, are not solely the domain of specialization. Therefore, those who supply architectural materials should not be compared with other stores. The publication of this issue aims to be comprehensive. Therefore, in discussing architecture, we pay special attention to materials. There are many in Shanghai who are engaged in architectural materials. In view of this, will those who are willing to come and cooperate seek development?</p>
<p>Furthermore, architecture and real estate naturally have an absolutely linked relationship. Therefore, this publication also pays special attention to real estate undertakings. All matters relating to real estate values, sales news, and the situation of those engaged in real estate undertakings are disclosed in full, so that the truth about real estate can be announced to the people of the country. All the world's undertakings seek development must first seek understanding. Now that this publication fulfills its responsibility to make people understand, its development in the real estate industry will inevitably be greatly stimulated. It is hoped that those engaged in real estate will assist us at any time and work together. In the future, Shanghai's prosperity and wealth may be a hundred or a thousand times greater than today. The colleagues are not talented, but are willing to be pioneers.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Shanghai's Architectural Undertakings Increase Day by Day <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Fuan</p>
<p>▲ The Past Five Years Called the Great Era of Architecture</p>
<p>▲ The Prosperity of This Port Will Tend to Be More Solid in the Future</p>
<p>This port is located on the shore of Chun Shen, with a superior location in the country. The Huangpu River meanders for twenty-five miles to reach the sea. Since the opening of trade, it has been called the communication center of Asia and the only major port in our country. However, in the past ten years, natural and man-made disasters in the country have followed one after another, and the world economy has also had an impact. It is difficult for all industries to avoid withering, but Shanghai has been able to remain stable and its prosperity has become more solid because of the daily increase and prosperity of its architectural undertakings. The past five years have been called the greatest era of architecture in China. Last year's January 28th Incident, the prosperity of Zhabei was all reduced to ashes, but thanks to the city government's efforts to seek revival, it is not difficult to gradually restore the old appearance of the pre-war scenery. The construction of the central administrative district of the city will also be completed in the near future. Recalling when the Battle of Shanghai was in full swing and the sound of artillery was deafening, many of the construction workers in this port were joyfully busy with the work of transporting sand, steel, and wood. The sound of hammering and the sound of artillery echoed each other, and the architectural fever at sea was like this, which is quite amazing. The statistical report on the construction of this port this year has not yet been completed, but the fact that it is rising steadily and has no end is undeniable. The amount spent on new buildings in this port was 45 million taels of silver in 1929, 70 million taels of silver in 1930, and slightly less due to the Shanghai Incident in 1931, dropping to 60 million taels of silver. As for this year's expenses, it is estimated by the general public to be around 60 million taels of silver. Now, I will briefly describe the content and situation of some of the buildings that have been completed or are under construction in this port, in order to see the general situation of the major buildings in this port.</p>
<p>Twenty-Two-Story Building of the Four Banks</p>
<p>㈠ Twenty-Two-Story Building of the Four Banks</p>
<p>Designed by Architect Udalak</p>
<p>Constructed by Fu Ji Construction Factory</p>
<p>The twenty-two-story building of the Four Banks Savings Association currently under construction can be called the tallest building at sea, and also the tallest building in the Eastern Hemisphere. It was designed by architect Udalak in this port. The foundation of the new building is located at the corner of Jing'an Temple Road and Park Road, facing the racecourse, covering an area of approximately 3,000 square feet. The engineer and contractor of the foundation is Kangyi Foreign Firm. The entire new building is constructed with a full steel frame, and the steel materials are supplied by Siemens China Company, representing the Wanhua steel factory (American steel factory). This steel material is a kind of gold-containing manganese steel, and its outstanding advantages include the following: high yield, high ductility, excellent rust prevention, and extremely satisfactory use. The tensile strength of the steel frame is 35.5 to 42 tons per square inch, or 52 kg per square meter, which is much higher than the 37 kg per square meter tensile strength of the steel materials used before. After the new building is completed, the ground floor, the first floor, and the basement will be used as the new site of the Four Banks Savings Association. The bank hall will be located on the ground floor, and the offices will be located on the first floor. As for the great vault and 6,000 safe deposit boxes, they will be installed in the basement. From the second floor to the twenty-second floor, it will be completely used for private residences and apartment hotels. The dining room is located on the second floor, and there is a public rest area on the fourteenth floor, facing the roof garden. The cost of the new building is a total of 2 million taels of silver, and it is being constructed by Fu Ji Construction Factory, founded by Mr. Tao Guilin. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Liu Futai</p>
<p>Historians do not always write history in books, because books are easily destroyed. If it is written on buildings, it can be preserved for a long time and is not easily destroyed. We can learn more and more truthfully about the work of ancient humans from the surviving remains than from handwriting. Can we now write our history on buildings, hoping it will last as long as our Great Wall of China and the Egyptian pyramids?</p>
<p>It is hoped that people today can imagine themselves as future archaeologists, excavating the surviving remains of modern buildings. This archaeologist can obtain the most interesting and novel information about the lives of modern people, which can give him the most peculiar and amazing feeling. Sometimes they will definitely go to see the existing buildings, monuments, and ruins of cities, and use a critical eye. After seeing them, they will know that these buildings were originally built for work, and the roads were built for cars. Their interest will immediately turn from private to public. In short, in this way, we can see our entire history. Because this kind of history is not like the historical narratives written in words by historians with personal opinions or creators of myths, such as some emotional narratives in Sima Qian's "Historical Records" and the myth of Pangu creating the world. However, this kind of architectural history is permanent, true, and unbiased. Architects are truly sincere historians, and their records are true and free of prejudice. They must be commanded and governed by the environment of the times, and they cannot arbitrarily prove the needs of industry and the demands of the people. Therefore, architects are people who leave behind true records. Try to imagine finding two architectural historians from the same era, just like two buildings of the same model. That is the result of their records.</p>
<p>Ordinary historians' records of history are inevitably based on personal observations, but after a long period of time, their records are regarded as true facts, and thus the personal basis of the situation is lost. However, architects will never have this kind of change. Architects' construction is based on the requirements of the environment and the urgency of the times, so this kind of record remains until the building is destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Important Tasks of Today's Architectural Circle <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Zidian, Shanghai Architectural Association</p>
<p>Urgent Need to Open an Eastern Major Port</p>
<p>The architectural industry is of great importance to the rise and fall of a country. It is also closely related to human happiness. The development of the architectural industry in European and American countries is growing day by day. Publications on architectural studies fill bookstores. Looking back at our country, specialized writings and periodicals on architectural studies are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, and cannot be seen much. The Shen Bao authorities, aware of this, have compiled a "Special Architectural Issue." The Shen Bao editors came to the association to meet with Mr. Du Yangeng, the standing committee member of the association, and discussed in detail the issue of improving the architectural industry. Mr. Du told them the tasks of today's architectural circle. In a nutshell, he said that we must start from practical work. For the sake of the development of national industry and the progress of the entire architectural circle, we must not delay. He elaborated on his various plans, and I recorded them as follows.</p>
<p>Domestic architectural publications are already extremely rare, but if one investigates their content, they are full of empty talk and make no concrete contributions to the development of national industry or the practical work of the architectural circle. What I hope for from the "Special Architectural Issue" is that it can eliminate common mistakes and guide the architectural circle with practical work, so as not to fail the original intention of publication.</p>
<p>Opening commercial ports is the most important and significant mission undertaken by the architectural circle in recent times. The late Premier, in his industrial plan for nation-building, had already elucidated the plan to open the three major ports in the East, North, and South. The realization of this plan depends on our colleagues in the architectural circle and those who aspire to engage in the architectural industry. We should work hard to promote its realization so that we can complete the plan of the late Premier. The initial progress should start with the opening of the Eastern Major Port, and then extend to the opening of the Northern Major Port and the Southern Major Port. It is also hoped that the people of the country can invest in it.</p>
<p>Opening up the Eastern Major Port</p>
<p>The Eastern Major Port is located in Hangzhou Bay, between Zhapu Cape and Ganpu Cape. Its location and transportation are superior. Once it is opened and developed, who knows that today's barrenness will not become the only bustling market in the East in the future, comparable to New York in the United States and London in England. A hundred years ago, who could have foreseen the prosperity of New York and London today? Regarding the opening of the Eastern Major Port, the late Premier had a detailed plan. Now I quote his words: "The distance from Zhapu Cape to Ganpu Cape is about fifteen miles. A seawall should be built from this cape to that cape, and a gap should be opened at the Zhapu end a few hundred feet away from the mountain as the main entrance to the port. This kind of seawall can be divided into five sections, each three miles long. Because now we build one section first, three miles long and one and a half miles wide, we will get a port area of three or four square miles, which is enough for use. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Architect Zhuang Jun, courtesy name Daqing, is a native of Shanghai, 45 years old. He graduated from Nanyang Middle School and studied at Xujiahui Nanyang University and Tangshan Railway and Mining School. Then, he passed the examination for the second session of the US Study Affairs Office and entered the University of Illinois in the United States to study architecture. In the third year of the Republic of China, he returned to China after completing his studies and served as the resident architect of Tsinghua University in Beiping, serving for nine years. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, he traveled to the United States again and entered Columbia University. In the fourteenth year, he traveled to various European countries. After returning to China, he established an office in Shanghai, specializing in architectural design and supervision. The new buildings of Jin Cheng, Jiao Tong, Da Lu, and other banks in Shanghai, Hankou, Jinan, Qingdao, Harbin, Dalian, Nanjing, and other ports were all planned by him alone. The Da Lu Shopping Mall in this city is also one of his recent carefully crafted works. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, he was registered as an industrial technician by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, a member of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, and served as the president, vice president, director, and consultant of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government.</p>

<h3 id="e190">The Need for More Short Films <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>It's strange that many people only pay attention to the feature film when watching a movie, as if the short film is insignificant. This is a huge mistake! I'm afraid this is the main reason why the Chinese film industry ignores short films.</p>
<p>The currently popular short films are nothing more than the following: 1. News; 2. Comedy; 3. Song and dance; 4. Children's plays or dog plays; 5. Charcoal drawings; 6. Science; 7. Scenery; 8. Others!</p>
<p>If we look for them in domestic films, the total number of short films is less than twenty. Of course, short films are just as troublesome to produce as feature films, and they don't sell for much money. Therefore, except for sensational news, such as sports competitions, almost no one is willing to spend effort and money to produce them. The lack of short films has led to the current depression of domestic films, and adding foreign short films before showing domestic films (mostly silent films) is inevitably incongruous. Therefore, we have to lengthen domestic films, sometimes meaningless, or simply shorten them in a simple way so that they must be about 11,000 feet long, enough for an hour and forty-five minutes of screening. There is no flexibility, which is an extremely far-fetched and difficult thing.</p>
<p>In the current situation, when there is a lack of film talents in China, shooting short films that do not require actors or that practice new actors is not a difficult task. For example, in the news aspect: great people flying around, the construction of various industries, grand ceremonies. There is no day without them: there are many good materials, which will definitely arouse the interest of the audience. In terms of scenery, China has great ancient architecture: there are different customs in North China and South China: the lives of Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Yunnan-Guizhou; which one is not what we like to see? Moreover, the natural beauty of the north and south of the Yangtze River is inexhaustible. Speaking of song and dance films: it is also possible to shoot some Chinese stage plays, which can not only adjust the tastes of the audience, but also be good cultural propaganda products if they are sold to foreign countries. It is more effective and lasting than Dr. Mei going to the United States. Isn't China trying to shoot comedy films? We should start with short film auditions, otherwise there will be no good results. Who among Rock, Chaplin, and Laurel and Hardy was not honed in short films? ·········</p>
<p>To give another example, ten years ago, MGM produced very few feature films, and all its energy was put on short films. What about now? Its position surpasses any film studio. Of course, the credit of short films is very large, and even this year, the average number of short films is still twice that of feature films. This is a good model and a good policy for film studios!</p>
<p>If you think that short films are not popular, that is a fact that can be proved. For example, the most monotonous landscape film, if it can be photographed skillfully and matched with high mountains and flowing water songs or music, how artistic is it? How can it be dry?</p>
<p>"Everything depends on human effort." If you want domestic films to develop and work for art: then you should focus on small things and start with exquisitely produced short films!</p>
<p>Two black-clad girls, who do you think they are?</p>
<p>They are Chen Yumei (right) and Li Minghui (left): both are pillars of Tianyi Company.</p>

<p>GillbirlAdiain now has a good business acumen, that is, to be the designer of the costumes of MGM's actresses. He is indeed a talented art expert. The strange Javanese and Russian costumes in Garbo's "Camille" added a lot of charm to Garbo. This is a good example of his talent.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e192">Review of "Little Actress" <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Shi</p>
<p>What is most difficult for a screenwriter is that when starting to write a script, he wants to write a script with a sound consciousness, but when the entire script is completed, for the sake of plot, structure, interspersion, etc., the original consciousness will often disappear by more than half. When the film is made, if the performance is not strong enough, or even makes the original consciousness only a trace.</p>
<p>If you want to find a bit of consciousness in the script of "Little Actress," there are only some vague shadows of "benevolence" and "filial piety." I speculate that the original intention of the screenwriter was to make a deeply touching ethical drama, but there are too many negative descriptions, which shift the audience's attention to the negative descriptions, making it overwhelm the positive.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the whole story, the first half describes the decline of an old family, and the second half describes the suffering of a shrew and a rogue. From beginning to end, a naive little girl is used as a connection, and the structure is quite good. Some people think that the description of Wang's shrewishness and Chen Naixin's viciousness is a bit too much, but I think there are extremely vicious people in the world, but we rarely encounter them.</p>
<p>The director has several very clever places, such as Wang's smashing of the photo frame sent by Ji Zhong, interspersed with Ji Zhong crying on the ground in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Also, Wang and Chen Naixin beat each other, transforming into Zhang Xiaolin and another little actress practicing gun skills, and the movements and postures are similar. These kinds of shots are both reasonable and interesting. As for the close-up of the wheels of the car when Wang and Naixin went to the racecourse, and the close-up of the wheels of the audience when the pastoral volume was shown, the repeated use of it seems to be meaningless.</p>
<p>The performance is best by the protagonist Yuan Meiyun. Some people say that she was originally a little actress, and now she plays a little actress on the screen, which is naturally very suitable. This seems reasonable, but it is not true, because the performance in drama films is different from real life. For example, if there is an officer, he is asked to play an officer on the stage or in the film, he may not perform well. Therefore, Yuan Meiyun's success in "Little Actress" is that she does have the talent for performance, and does not rely on her life experience, because her life process will never have the experience of joys and sorrows in the "Little Actress" drama.</p>
<p>The performances of other actors are all on the horizontal line. Shu Lijuan's shrew and Ge Furong's coward have more opportunities to perform, but they can only arouse the audience's superficial laughter and cannot make the audience get a deep impression.</p>
<p>The light and scenery are all good, and the sound is also very clear, but it is a pity that there are a few places with a little noise, which is a bit imperfect!</p>
<h3 id="e193">Common Myopia <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>At present, everyone's understanding of a film actor, whether male or female! Especially female actors, is inevitably superficial, and does not actually pursue their success or failure. I think this is very dangerous.</p>
<p>Is this actor's face beautiful? Is she a passionate girl? Or is his or her dress fashionable or not? This has almost become a common meal for ordinary people to criticize a film actor.</p>
<p>In fact, this is really a huge mistake.</p>
<p>Who is a successful actor? I think only by criticizing with the standard of "how superb is his or her art" is correct. Film is an art "this is known to everyone, so a film is definitely not successful by relying on a few beautiful faces or some superficial expressions. The art of actors' performance is its only life element.</p>
<p>Therefore, the success of an actor is undoubtedly not able to be promoted by those people's superficial criticism. It is pitiful, is the common people's myopia.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Believe it or not <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>

<h3 id="e195">More Attention Should Be Paid to the Cultivation of Child Actors <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Jinsha</p>
<p>A family without children feels boring; at the same time, the movie would be too monotonous if there were no children.</p>
<p>In domestic films, it can simply be said that there are no child actors, which really makes us extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>In fact, the performance ability of children is not lower than that of adults, and there are many places where only children can perform. Children's expressions are innocent, without affectation, without hypocrisy. Like the performance of the little friend in the humanitarianism produced by Lianhua, it really moves us. In many places, it is more touching to have children perform than adults. The little friend in "Humanity" is a good example.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are eager for the birth of child actors. Naturally, it is more difficult for a director to train a child actor than to train ten adults, but we hope that the director will not be afraid of difficulties. I hope that the director can put the energy of training ten adults on one child actor.</p>
<p>Movies are great, and children's movies are especially great! Don't forget the great responsibility! Director and film company!</p>

<p>Dear Editor, yesterday I read several short messages published in your journal by Jizhong, which contained many inaccuracies. The most bizarre thing is that it was actually said that since Li Ping and other gentlemen joined our company, there has been a division between the old and new factions within the company, and there is a lack of cooperation in form and spirit, which may hinder the company's future. After reading it, I was extremely surprised and noticed that the intention was close to instigation. Since Li and other gentlemen have joined successively, they have been harmonious with the original employees and actors, so the work has proceeded very smoothly. The so-called division of the new and old factions is all fabrication. Although I dare not be sure whether the author intends to slander, but this kind of nonsense has appeared in the newspaper, and if it causes suspicion, it is really detrimental to our company. Therefore, I specially send a letter hoping that you will correct it on our behalf. I am very grateful and respectful to you. Xingming Film Company, twenty-one, eleven, thirty,</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Jizhong is one of the contributors to this journal, and the news collected may contain inaccuracies. As soon as it is published, it will damage the reputation of the other party. I am very grateful for the letter from Xingming Company pointing out this. In addition to disclosing and correcting the original letter, I also hope that Mr. Jizhong can explain it. (Not sensitive)</p>

<h3 id="e197">What are the female stars doing after leaving the photography scene? (Part 1) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Xingxiu</p>
<p>The luxury and romance of the lives of female movie stars are of course not limited to Hollywood alone, and the same is true for Chinese female stars. Here, I am only talking about a part of the lives of Chinese female stars, that is, what they do after leaving the photography scene.</p>
<p>Their hobbies are naturally not the same. After they have finished their serious work and left the photography scene, what they do is undoubtedly not the same.</p>
<p>Due to different times or climates, the work they do after completing their work also changes with the time and climate. For example, in summer, female stars go to Gaohashi beach to swim, but in winter, they will not go anymore. Now I can only write a little about what they usually and daily do.</p>
<p>Ruan Lingyu often plays mahjong to pass the time, but she cannot be determined to be the one who loves playing mahjong the most. Lin Chuchu is her old mahjong partner. They both work in the first factory of Lianhua. Xia Peizhen also often borrows mahjong to pass the time when she is idle. She also has an old partner who is in the same game with her, who is Hua Wanfang.</p>
<p>Lin Chuchu already has two children. The older one is a son and the younger one is a daughter, namely Li Keng and Li Xuan. They have both shown their faces in the film "Humanity". These two lively and lovely children are Lin Chuchu's second life. She can take care of the warmth, food, and all the responsibilities related to the health of the children, and sometimes she has to make clothes for the children, and she is a loving mother. Xu Qinfang loves her children in the same way as her. Ms. Xu originally had four children, and one died last year. Now there are still three. (To be continued)</p>
