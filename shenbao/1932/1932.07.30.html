<p>時評</p>
<h3>駒井德三辭職　梓</h3>
<p>吾人偶一想及東北僞組織之傀儡戲。總不免要聯想及於幕後牽線之駒井德三。駒井德三者以日人而任僞組織之所謂國務院總務廳長官。一手操縱僞組織之全部行動者也。</p>
<p>頃據東京長春電訊。駒井將被迫飛回日京。解决辭職問題矣。以號稱獨立之僞組織重要長官。而辭職問題。須向日京求解决。傀儡戲中之怪象。吾人不欲多談而駒井辭職之原因。則吾人大有注意之必要。駒井以日京文官與軍部之主張背道而馳。不得不出於辭職。其離長春時。聲言待抵東京。將以滿洲之事情。率直披瀝已之所信。以求當局諒解。並表示願鞠躬瘁。以當滿洲統治之任。戀棧之心。昭然若揭。而日内閣與軍部。不待駒井之至已協議繼任人選且因軍部堅執反對抱自由主義者之繼任。拒絶以齋藤首相幕客丸山繼駒井。發生内閣軍部之爭端。然則駒井因近於自由主義爲軍部所不容而辭職乎。以駒井之爲人。尚可目爲近於自由主義乎。</p>
<p>駒井初畢業於札幌帝國大學農科。一九一一年以所著「滿洲大豆論」得農科學士之頭銜。翌年就職南滿鐵道會社受當局者識拔。擬給巨資。遣赴歐洲視察因彼堅决之陳請。乃改命視察全中國。調查各地產業。尤注意於我東北全土之經濟。歷時四載。滿鐵當局易人。後來者對駒井之報告。不加重視。駒井乃决然而去。其後服務於東京外務省。但其侵略我東北之野心未嘗或忘。及九一八事變。遂以日關東軍財政顧問。一躍而爲東北僞組織之眞正支配者。彼以二十年之長歲月。專心致力於侵略我東北之工作。就其經營公主嶺廣袤六十九萬坪之農場。國聯調查團見之。驚爲巨觀。吾人於此。可知日本侵略主義之實行者之處心積慮矣。</p>
<p>駒井之不得不被迫辭職。或者日軍部不滿於彼對國聯調查團之表示乎。調查團極注意於僞組織對東北之是否維持門户開放。而駒井一面宣稱維持門户開放。一面又表示所謂對差誤的資本主義及資本家之排斥。並對日本資本家亦表示拒絶此則大背日本國内對滿蒙積極政策之狂潮。而遭日軍人誤認爲反對併吞滿蒙政策者也。然駒井固視其自身之工作。爲使日本實現新大陸政策之第一步者。而尚爲軍部所不滿。遭軍部之排斥。則日軍部</p>
<p>陰謀計劃之兇猛。又從可見矣。</p>
<p>使駒井而果爲近於自由主義者。則日本自由主義之特性。可見一斑。然鹤見裕輔。固一澈頭澈尾之自由主義政論家也。其去年在太平洋學會時之言論。已使吾人對於自由義之涵義。發生疑念駒井固無足怪也。吾對於駒井事而不勝基感慨者。敵國之自由主義人物如此。而吾國之號稱自由主義之人物。乃於敵人積極侵略之時。竟提出「遷就事實」之主張。欲向敵求必不可得之和平。嗚呼。吾國自由主義之特性。果如此乎。</p>

<p>錦標　世界亞林匹克運動會並無總錦標之制、每項運動以字母之先後將得勝者前六名之姓名、嵌之於榮譽證書、其證書由國際亞林匹克委員會保管之、通言某國得第幾屆世界亞林匹克運動會錦標者、乃指田徑賽錦標而言蓋田徑賽爲大會之主體</p>

<p>網球足球世界亞林匹克運動會無網球比賽、因每年有台維斯杯之國際網球賽及惠勃爾登之國際個人網球賽之故、至於足球一項、原有列入、而第九屆世界運動會之足球比賽、尤見興盛、故我國初擬派足球隊參加、祇因規則問題而决取消、若萬國足球會允將規則略加修改、以合於業餘運動之需要、亦可加入惟前年萬國足球會匈牙利京城開會時、會議决不變更其所持態度、故本屆大會卒未能列入、</p>

<p>納米禁止參加（二十八日洛山磯電）芬蘭長跑家納米氏、因曾得資指敎、致業餘運動員之資格發生問題、該氏已抵此開始練習今日國際業餘運動聯盟審查結果、不承認納米氏爲業餘運動員、正式發表禁止出席、納氏係五千米一四分二八秒二、及一萬米三○分六秒二之世界紀錄保持者、擬出席於此次亞林匹克之馬拉松跑但不准出席致爲一輩跑迷所惜、（編者按）納米氏參加世界運動會凡四次、但從未參加馬拉松跑、納氏前曾宣言、今年第十屆大會中、决參加馬拉松跑、以結束其平生運動事業、此種行爲、殊足風世、今不料因犯業餘規則、不准其參加、誠納米生平運動事業中之最大遺憾、</p>

<h3>糧食新粳續到十八石</h3>
<p>南市昨日米情浦新新粳又到十八石、陳貨共到十數號、形勢漲而復疲、客方亦受影響、蘇同帮低落角許、早薄稻鄉莊帮買去三百石、開盤定局、常錫北粳及杜洋尖胃口寥寥、形勢下游、新粳祗有零碎去路、價與前盤相仿、</p>
<p>新閘昨日到船十念號、中關白粳零拆不見起色、店方態度新貨上市、陳貨冷淡、靑角楓練</p>
<p>早晚稻無人過問、價俏二角、洋杜尖來貨不旺、客帮續辦、增起近角糯米無榮無辱、</p>
<h3>天津帮續辦洋米</h3>
<p>昨洋米市况客化略活、天津帮續辦西貢米、江北鎭江崇明内地各帮則有小絞米問津、因此人心轉好、市形略形挺撑、但統市成交仍祇五千包、而貨主則以市價見好、羣思售出、故行情未有上升、西貢一號次米開一千五百包價十元零二角二分至十元零一角小絞三千餘包價九元四角半、九元一二角至九元、天津帮辦去西貢五百包、小絞米由各帮辦去二千包、其餘盡爲本街收進、目下以各帮辦胃又活、今後倘交易不斷、則市價似有步好之可能云云、</p>
<h3>二盤後標粉漲勢見厲</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面呈初平繼漲之象、以洋麥報價芝加哥好二三角、坎拿大小四分左右、兼以買方初無動靜、開價無所出人、惟二盤後、因津烟等客帮、近遠各期均有進胃、數量頗暢、致人心又復熱奮、步步高振、投機多户、亦趁此機會、逐盤吸進、所以漲度頗烈、觀後步情形、聞國外麥市、估計减少、故此後來華與否、大堪注意也、結果本月份較前日漲二分二厘半、八月份漲一分七釐半、九月份漲二分、十月份漲一分二厘半、十一月份漲一分半、十二月份漲一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>一部份浮多回出期麥</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面上午開盤後、以洋麥雖漲二三角坎小四分、惟一般人心思、因前日麥漲甚銳粉則漲度不多、故一部分浮多、曾逐步回出、致市勢略呈平軟、惟内地客户、心思已見大穏、此後抛户、難期暢盛、如果洋麥不划、則標準市値、尚未能算高、所以重入佳途、未爲奇也、結果八月份較前日小一分、九月份小三、分十月份小二分、十一十二月份小二分、現麥市况、已入混亂因身分及產地關係、開價大有參差、如固鎭高麥以貨少身足、開至三兩四錢、與標準已相仿佛、餘若鎭江麥開三兩一錢七分、雙鳳麥三兩一錢半、太倉麥三兩零五分、浦東麥二兩八錢八分、計一千四百餘包、由華豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白趨勢更挺</h3>
<p>生砂赤逐升一錢</p>
<p>昨糖市公會市塲劃盤荷糖二十四號組砂白、人氣殊佳、喊價十四兩七錢、但買户多存觀望、而吃價較低、成交甚寥、後市十四兩六錢、成交二百袋、進出兩懈、趨勢殊挺、十四號生砂赤逐升至十二兩四錢、交易尚活、太古糖Ｂ嘜升十六兩三錢、ＣＷ嘜十五兩八錢半、市存告斷、ＤＹ嘜十五兩四錢半、ＨＸ嘜十五兩三錢半、ＨＭ嘜十四兩九錢、交易雖見零落、市形則殊爲堅俏云、</p>
<h3>閘北貨新金山枝號盤步鬆</h3>
<p>蘭竹枝微跌</p>
<p>金山枝新貨近以來源轉湧、號盤已見步鬆、上牌元枝自三十兩進關後、現已降至二十六兩許、普通莊爲二十三兩左右、扁枝則前後已降七八兩、糯米枝因各行間有自辦、進本較廉、行盤遷就、竟鬆去十餘兩、故客方見市價步鬆、進貨反趨觀望態度、倘號盤能卽平定、則售價亦轉穏矣、</p>
<p>蘭竹枝新貨初到僅十箱、故首盤得開二十七兩六、二帮續到數亦不上百箱昨已開出貨品略有上落、上牌開二十七兩、次照减、較之前盤跌數錢至一兩、烏葉枝昨市尚屬首盤、開價不上十八兩、早紅枝數少、無甚上落、</p>
<h3>絲茶魯挽手運滬不弱</h3>
<p>英倫發現新銷路…月有六百担交易山東所產之大二挽手（卽黃絲頭）、盛銷法國、今歲因受日絲屑廉價侵銷之影響、魯挽手法銷步趨疲滯、近近幸發現英國新銷路、祥茂等月有六百包交易、故滬存漸薄、昨日烟靑班輪通州號運到大二挽手七百八十担、分存恒興公等絲棧云、</p>
<h3>白廠經三十包運杭</h3>
<p>杭垣各絲織商、在滬抛購之本月份現期白廠經、兹因月終已屆、各廠商紛紛交解、分批運杭、昨日滬杭車又有ＳＦ等牌二十至二十二條份白廠經三十包運杭、係預備織造各綢云</p>
<h3>國内外絲銷完全停頓</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、因海外暑假期中、絲電均不轉、歐莊觀望、國内絲織廠僉以秋銷落令、金融奇緊大半减工停機、生絲需要毫無、進胃奇淡、昨市國内外絲銷完全停頓云、</p>
<h3>針眉綠茶銷暢價漲</h3>
<p>昨日路莊土莊兩路之針眉綠茶、英法行家、進意續趨濃厚、華茶商以手中存貨不多、態度益形堅挺、市盤因之較前激漲三四兩、婺源大帮綠茶、近兩日來幾爲怡和、錦隆兩行搜買凈盡、惟售盤五十二三兩、較上年見低十兩、珍眉綠茶屯溪歙縣遂安土莊等路貨均有零星交易、價尚堅定、但婺源西北鄉之臘光貨、仍未至發展時機、貢熙綠茶及祁寗紅茶、市面亦均寥落云、</p>
<h3>疋頭國產駝羢現有成交</h3>
<p>呢羢市面、近因洋厘之短縮、政府進行廢兩改元之際、買方咸審愼而少進各貨、現祇國產駱駝羢有現定成交、若緯綸·天翔·維一·先達·勝達·鴻發·茂業·統一·達昌·華東·大南·大達·大中國等牌、一律喊售二兩一錢半、素色一兩八錢、大得·大東·天益爲一兩九錢、章華綿羊圖寬緊條子爲一兩六錢云、</p>
<h3>五金法西釘新貨續到</h3>
<p>法西釘市面、自本廠釘走銷活潑後、趨勢大受打擊、標準逐步下游、最近價每桶祇估七兩五錢、比前跌落五錢、但買主方面、緣本廠釘亦可出口、所以均不願購辦舶來品、（卽法西釘）是以銷路一節、大受影響、標準大有暗鬆之勢、惟昨日新貨又裝到二千餘桶、緣此底存愈厚人心愈衰、行情一層、由是更不許樂觀也、</p>
<h3>東白鐵暗中活動</h3>
<p>東北戰事正酣、海上英血未乾、而一般傷心狂病之奸商、目下已多活動、所以東白鐵之流動於市上者、已數見而不鮮、聞三七尺每張成本祇七錢光景、三六尺五錢四五分、較之現市英貨三七尺每張估九錢、三六尺七錢八分、已覺便宜二錢左右、查目下東白鐵來申亦多、改裝平鐵扎、惟其花頭稀、性質硬、而其牌子、前以三星太陽洋房等牌、刻改刷紅鳥紅洋字諸牌、惟較之英貨仍有區别、惟願買主方面祈十分注意之也、</p>
<h3>煤炭博山煤銷呆價跌</h3>
<p>博山煙煤、近來銷路大呆、緣　路客帮、採辦不勁、本埠各工廠家、進胃亦懈、是以盤價下跌、昨日市場做開二百餘噸、篩塊煤僅售十兩、統煤八兩七錢半、煤屑八兩五錢云</p>
<h3>兩白煤市價再跌</h3>
<p>紅崎白煤與山西白煤、近兩月來市價頻跌每噸通扯約跌二兩有餘、無如售價雖跌、而銷路始終不動、日來成交每日不過百噸左右、故市價又呈不穏、昨日市場售開價目、紅崎白煤每噸十八兩七錢五分、山西白煤十五兩七錢五分、較上週又跌二錢五分云、</p>

<p>本市連日謡傳、日軍又於閘北一帶、有示威行動、故救國聯合會、有請市政府當局、增防閘北等情、昨日上午十一時許、突又有大批日軍在閘北經過之說、形勢驟爲緊張、新聲社記者昨爲澈底明瞭該項事實起見、特赴閘北五區及閘北區域内、詳細調查、始悉該項謡傳、完全出於誤會、兹將所得情形誌後、</p>
<h3>搬運遺下絲網引起多人誤會</h3>
<p>記者昨向天通庵寳興路虬江路一帶、詳細調查、始知二十五日左右、日本軍隊、在淞滬路之東沿出口各處及黃陸路日海軍陸戰隊司令部後面、搜集殘破絲網、與沙包等物、并運往平凉路紗廠、致附近居民、不悉内容、紛起疑竇、謂日本海軍、將在閘北行動、過甚其詞、愈傳愈眞、幸該處市公安局警士、當時見狀、即向居民解釋、未生混亂、故日來所傳閘北又有日軍行動之說、全係出於該項誤會、同時不免有好事者流、故事警惶或散播謡言、以惑人心、亦未可知、</p>
<h3>昨日日軍參觀又起一塲虛驚</h3>
<p>自我方接收Ｄ區後、日海軍司令部方面、屢次向五區公安局、要求至閘北一帶參觀、當時五區加以拒絶、迄未允許、嗣又派一參謀、轉向接管委員會方面要求、始允於二十八·二十九·兩日、許予至閘北參觀、故二十八日上午、由五區公安局派機器脚踏車隊、導引至東寳興路·寳興路·虹江路·一帶參觀、以免居民悞會驚慌、昨日上午十時許、仍由五區公安局分署派警隊導引至Ｄ區一帶參觀、此兩日赴閘北參觀之日軍、完全未帶武裝、人數約八十人、同乘汽車前去、但閘北居民、終因驚弓之鳥、見狀不免仍起惶惑、甚有擬遷居者、同時一班智識淺薄者、又向多方傳說、致一時市虎杯蛇、相驚伯、有其實日軍祗隨公安局警士、於車中巡視一過、旋即他去、居民亦即安心無事、</p>
<h3>漢奸擾亂治安警力足以維持</h3>
<p>新聲社記者、昨日特赴市府訪問此事之眞相、當蒙某重要職員負責答復此事、業經派員詳細偵查、並無絲毫事實、查此傳說、完全係漢奸與好事之徒造謡生事所致、現在市府派駐閘北之警察保安隊、力量充足、對於該區域之治安、頗能維持有餘云</p>
<h3>公大紗廠日軍昨晨撤防</h3>
<p>移防大康紗廠</p>
<p>並未通知我方</p>
<p>日日社云、引翔鄉平凉路公大紗廠、與滬西豐田紗廠日軍、當共同委員會我方委員俞鴻鈞、向日委岡崎迭次交涉兩廠日軍撤退確期、但岡崎屢謂、兩廠駐兵、在一二八以前即有、而我方俞氏、當以兩廠地處華界、應由我方警力保護、不能常駐不去、致惑民心等詞駁覆、嗣岡崎因我方理由充足、允於Ｄ區日軍撤退、該兩廠日軍、即日續撤、自本月十七日、Ｄ區日軍撤退後、迄未聞日方表示兩廠日軍撤退之確期、而昨晨十一時日方忽將平凉路公大紗廠所駐日海軍陸戰隊第二大隊之一小隊兵士三十餘人、自動撤防、移駐楊樹浦路大康紗廠、復據日日社記者調查、事雖屬實、然日方昨日並未向我方通知云、</p>
<h3>宋宅昨無會議</h3>
<p>宋患腹瀉暫不見客</p>
<p>中央社云、財政部長宋子文氏、因封鎖東北海關問題及廢兩改元事宜、有與本埠有關係各界、再度接洽之必要、故於前日、由京乘飛機棶來滬、宋氏抵滬後、因身體感覺不適、當延英醫麥里醫士診治中央社記者、昨日探悉宋氏病狀及其他消息分誌如次、</p>
<p>宋氏病狀據財政部秘書郭德華自宋宅探病出後、語中央社記者云、宋氏因籌劃財政、侯僕於京滬平漢之間、旅次勞頓、在所不免、且日來天氣酷炎、航空未免凉暑兼侵、故宋氏抵滬後、即感受不適、宋氏現病腹瀉、人亦路瘦、今晨（即昨晨）九時許、又延英醫麥里氏診治、據謂、偶受感冒、囑伊靜養、一二日内、即可全痊云云、</p>
<p>昨無會議宋氏遵醫之囑、閉户謝客、故昨日各界前往訪謁者、均拒不見、惟稅務司西人郭彭·江海關監督唐海安·財政部秘書郭德華·則於昨日上午奉宋召往謁、略談片時即出、故宋宅昨日無會議、</p>
<p>病愈離滬　據記者探悉、宋氏本定昨晚乘坐原機飛京、惟因腹瀉、尚未全愈、醫囑不可航空、故宋氏决暫留滬、俟病體完全復原後、再行返京、宋氏介弟子良已於昨晚乘輪赴廬山、并聞宋氏病愈後、亦擬赴廬山一行、宋夫人張樂怡女士、現在廬避暑、</p>
<h3>封鎖海關有待</h3>
<p>國聞社記者昨由接近宋氏方面者得獲消息、宋氏此來仍以封鎖東北海關爲最大任務、軍費廢兩在其次、外傳封鎖東北海關、將於八月一日實行、恐未能如此迅速、關稅非郵政可比、將來假使東北貨物、由大連出口、海道運華、則何從證明其爲僞國出品、天津關限於條約、又非東省入華北之綜匯處所、所以中央對此、有甚大困難、至參與討論此問題之進行、當然除宋外、爲關務署長張福運·總稅務司梅樂和·顧問張壽鏞·及財部西人顧問、而此數人、對東北海關問題始終未肯以半語洩諸外間、因知兹事體大、唯恐將來封鎖令下、祇具封鎖之名、而無封鎖之實、豈非徒露自己弱點、因此中央對此愼重將事、非至有十分把握時、不下封鎖之命令、八月一日、離今祇兩天、倘如期實行、則海關方面、今日必有命令、兹關係各方、均未見此消息、當然有困難、尚在從長討論中、一日實行、恐無此迅速耳云、</p>
<h3>日人反對我二重稅</h3>
<p>日領之表示</p>
<p>田代之意見</p>
<p>時聞社云、由滬運入東北貨物、本埠海關當局、有於八月一日起、照規定新章、征收進出口全稅、日本時局委員會、爲此問題、特於昨日、公推行政委員長安井、向日領提出請求、並恊議反對方針、同時新由東京調任來滬之日本總領館武官田代少將、召集駐滬軍官北岡·喜多·荻根·根本·田中·等連日在日商俱樂部、舉行會議、恊議一切、</p>
<p>日領表示日時局委員會代理行政委員長安井、於昨日下午一時許、爲我方海關、已决定於八月一日起、征收運入東北貨物進出口全稅事、代表全體日商、赴日總領事館、向村井提出要求、改作非正式之恊商、據村井表示、謂關稅於下月一日、上海海關將開征運入東北貨物二重稅一事、此事關於整個對華貿易、政府方面、已决定於下月一日、華方海關開征收二重稅之時、提出嚴重抗議、本人殊無權向中國政府、提出交涉、但余之意見、對於此項問題、認中國政府、確有破壞中日友好通商條約之處、且中國政府之開征運入東北貨物二重稅、其理由係對滿洲新國之接收大連海關、惟滿洲國此次接收東北海關全係出於自動、（？）一切責任、應由滿洲國負其全責、今中國政府不向負有責任國方面、提出交涉而以征收二重稅對抗、致我商民、無故受此痛苦、於理殊不可解、余曾一再致電政府、請從速向華方交涉、今政府復電已到滬、謂如中國海關、果於八月一日實施此項征稅、卽當於是日提出嚴重抗議云、故可深信政府已有良好辦法、請君（指安井）轉告僑民、勿自相恐慌云云、</p>
<p>田代意見滬戰時之日方遣派軍參謀田代少將、此次奉令調任駐滬總領館武官、對于我方開征東北二重稅、及應付抵制日貨等問題均有深切之關係、昨今兩日、田代少將並召集駐滬軍官北岡·喜多·荻根·根本·田中等、舉行重要會議于日商俱樂部兩日來之會議席上、對于我國海關開征運入東北貨物二重稅及應付排日等問題、均有詳盡之討論、據時聞社記者探悉、田代少將、在昨日會議席上、發表關于我方開征二重稅事意見云、自從滬戰發生我（田代自稱日本）在滬僑商、莫不受絶大之影響、是時佘雖爲派遣軍參謀、然亦無法可保護彼等繼續營業、迨戰局終止我僑商爲力圖恢復舊狀、曾極力從事於整理以迄于今、幸已稍稍復元、乃中國政府藉口滿洲國之接收大連海關、而實行征收輸入東北貨物之進出口稅、中國政府此項舉動固專爲對我而發、惟是滿洲國與日本可謂毫無關係（、？）何能代人受過、且此事關係我方對東北貿易、極有重大損失、今上海海關、且有於下月一日開始實行征收之說、故此事似已成爲事實、目下唯一應付方法、除以武力保護之外、實無其他方法、因貨物之運入東北、决不能繞過中國任何海關而直達之也、余以爲此項武力保護運貨政策、應于中國海關開始實行征收二重稅之日起、同時實行、余並極願努力促成此事、以解我商民痛苦云云、</p>

<h3>消暑勝境高橋海水浴塲</h3>
<p>設備交通一瞥</p>
<p>上海無湖山之勝、每當盛夏、因職務覊身者、終日碌碌、除公暇散步公園外、絶少淸閒消暑之所、尤以休沐假日長晝炎炎、惟困於蚊陣汗雨之間而已、滬上外僑在星期暇時、輒結伴往海濱試浴、碧水層浪、沙帆風鷗、浮没其間、可濾塵俗、年來我國仕女亦每習泅水術、本市政府公用局特開闢道路、佈置浴塲、以爲提倡國民運動、豈祗爲閒散消暑而已耶、</p>
<p>設備海水浴塲、闢於浦東高橋鎭北之海濱、黃沙如帶、滄波瀰望、其最深處亦僅及肩、雖不諳泅水術、亦能直立水中、其淺處則没踝而已、塲之四週、遍樹紅旗、以爲標示、越此則海水漸深、即能淺泳者亦不宜冐險前進也、沙岸之後、碧草茵上、架木爲屋、圍以靑白相間之帆布帘、其内設置几椅、並備汽水啤酒餐點糖菓等、爲遊客休息之所、更有布傘布榻陳於沙岸上、任客小坐、屋之兩側、木亭十餘、則爲更衣洗盥之處、供客借用、每間六角、所備水盆皂巾、均甚淸潔、惟海浴後無淋浴之處爲缺憾耳、游泳衣亦有出租、惟係線織者、未習水性者御之、恐易感冐、且所備不多、往遊者宜各自備一襲、較適於用、</p>
<p>交通由上海至該浴塲雖須三易舟車、但公用局佈置周到、故無旅途之苦、游客先在外灘銅人碼頭搭乘市輪渡、特等每客半元、直達高橋該輪爲浦江中設備最完美、渡輪座位寬暢、船艙淸潔、在高橋登岸、即有公共汽車候於該處、車資自碼頭至高橋鎭、僅收一角下車後、則更須改乘人力車、公用局規定車資每輛每次四角、且派員在該處指揮車夫兼任招待、故秩序井然、遊客稱便、全程需時二小時許、如搭頭班輪前往（上午七時開）則九時許即可達浴塲矣、</p>

<h3>四庫大辭典序　王雲五</h3>
<p>因爲文文山說過、「一部十七史從何處說起、」所以近人往往也說、「一部二十四史從何處讀起、」其實二十四史祇有三千二百多卷、二千八百餘萬字、比諸四庫全書的七萬九千多卷、七萬萬餘字、本來算不得一回事、就是那四庫全書、如果用普通字體和版式排印裝訂起來、至多也不過一萬册、比諸巴黎倫敦華盛頓等圖書館藏書都在四百萬册以上的更算不得一回事、但是我們從没有聽見那些圖書館的讀者、—尤其是華盛頓國會圖書館的讀者、—也說「從何處讀起」的話、去年我游歷歐美各國曾在華盛頓圖書館讀了十日的書、居然把該館四百多萬册藏書當中所有關於科學管理的圖書雜誌一千多册、都涉獵過、有人疑心這或者不是事實其實、一點都不是虛話、因爲該館的藏書目片、編製得非常完備、祗要在目錄室中、按照直接和間接有關係的標題、檢閱種種目片、那就各類的重要書籍叢著論文和相關門類等、以及各書的名稱分量版本出版年日内容性質槪要和相關著作等、各著者的姓名時代資格學術和其他著作等、没一樣不呈現们眼前、我們看了各書的種種目片以後、已經明白其大槪、然後分别去取、把必須閱讀的圖書借到手中、再從每書的索引檢到其中必須閱讀的部分、於是當讀的圖書不過占全體藏書萬千分之一、而當讀的部分也不過占當讀圖書千百分之一、照這樣辦法在那茫茫滄海的藏書搜其中的一、粟便毫無難處也就不致有「從何處讀起」的困苦、</p>
<p>除了這些便利參考的圖書館目片以外、歐美各國的讀書利器還很多、如圖書辭典、論文索引、書報提要等都是其編制多按字母順序、旣便檢查、又可以一目瞭然、因之讀書界也就不致有「從何處讀起」的困苦、我國目錄之學、向稱精詳、關於目錄的著作也不少、但往往一書詳一事、讀者不易得一槪括的觀念、而且分類過泛、檢查也很不便、欲求一按字典式排列而能與人以槪括觀念的圖書辭典却不可得、梁任公行生前曾有編輯中國圖書大辭典的計畫、卒未竟其志楊家駱先生精研目錄之學、也從事於中國圖書大辭典的編輯、猛進不已、先成四庫大辭典一部以四庫全書總目二百卷著錄、存目各書及其著者爲範圍範圍内的書名人名均各立一條、凡一萬七千餘條、二百五十餘萬字、書名條下包括卷數、附錄及其卷數、撰人或編注人姓名、類次、解題、版本各項、撰人條下包括所著或所編注各書名稱、撰人時代、籍貫、小傳、四庫失收之著作名稱、撰人詳傳參考書各項、又因按字典式編制爲謀檢查便利起見、採取拙作四角號碼檢字法排列、稿成付印、囑我作序、我認爲這書和上述歐美各國的字典式圖書辭典相符、直是我國第一部最適用最便檢查的圖書大辭典、對於我國讀書界向來所感「從何處讀起」的困見可以一舉解除所以一方面希望楊先生早日完成中國圖書大辭典的工作、一方面很高興的把這部書介紹於讀書界、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>俗語本事</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>長夏無事，研究各處的俗語，也是一種消夏的方法。俗語有普通的，有特殊的；普通的俗語，不限定在某處，特殊的俗語，只限定在某處，别處人聽了，便不明瞭，只爲俗語裏面含有本事的緣故。</p>
<p>戚子卿家小二，不說好話。｜｜這是蘇州的俗語，本事載在雙金錠彈詞裏面，蘇州訟師戚子卿，僱一書僮，喚做小二，生平不說好話。以後，凡遇不說好話的人，蘇人便嘲他是戚子卿家小二。</p>
<p>黃金壩的都天，假到底。｜｜這是揚州俗語，載在石天基所撰的假都天說部，據說；揚州黃金壩有一鄉愚，自稱都天神下降　　動民衆，都往燒香；未幾，被金太守洞悉黑幕，指破奸僞，其事遂歸失敗。後來，凡遇作僞的事，便說：黃金壩的都天，假到底。</p>
<p>猪婆龍爲殃，癩頭黿頂缸。這是金陵俗語，載在褚石農的堅瓠續集。據說：明初，上淸河一帶，猪婆龍作祟：只爲朱太祖多忌諱，工部上奏，不敢說猪，只說大黿爲患。太祖爲着黿字同元朝的元字相同，諭令漁人，殺黿殆盡。漁人釣黿，用穿底缸覆黿首，使不能活動。後來，凡遇李代桃僵的事，便說：猪婆龍爲殃，癩頭黿遭殃。</p>
<p>香菰山貓兒瞎呌。｜這是温州俗語，載在王朝淸的兩窗雜詠。據說：甌越山間，多種香菰；爲防鼠害，恒取貓狸，挖去雙眼，飼養在山中；貓旣瞽目，便不他往，只有晝夜瞎呌，鼠輩聞聲，就此遠避了。後來，凡遇妄人無知呌囂不休的，便說：香菰山貓兒瞎呌。</p>
<h3>戰壕内之土上標語</h3>
<p>— 王羽</p>
<p>一二八之役。我十九路軍奮勇抵抗。至以孤軍與敵人數倍兵力相持達三十二晝夜之久。殊大出敵人意外。即歐美軍事家亦莫不驚奇。敵之報紙尤盛稱我軍所掘戰壕謂爲某國式軍士伏於壕内。旣不受砲火威脅。使敵彈虛耗。莫損分毫。飛機亦不能下瞰戰壕之所在。以致擲彈無的。恒不能中。而伏於壕内之軍士。乃能以逸待勞俟敵衝近。然後躍出。制勝如探囊取物。則我軍之能以少數勝多。誠非偶然也。我友某君。戰時嘗赴前線。親入戰壕。據談。戰壕中容積至廣。軍士在内。異常鎭靜。一任敵砲頻轟。絶不爲意。非敵衝鋒近前。决不應戰故外報評論一二八之役。曾目爲假戰。爲滑稽。以戰區中轟轟不絶之砲聲。胥敵所發。我軍甚少回擊。有如强者以拳足加於弱者。弱者並不以同樣之横暴施於强者。竟能制勝也。因此。在戰壕中之軍士。乃至暇豫。竟有以碎碗之磁屑。嵌土上成字作標語。「如保衛國土」。「驅逐日本帝國主義之軍隊出我國境」。「沉著應戰」。「誓與此壕共生死」。「洗滌不抵抗之恥辱」等。極費匠心。似此臨大敵而能鎭靜。安得不勝。苟非白川潛襲瀏河。始終在正面交戰。則我軍雖寡。必不至退守也。又倘政府早發援軍。厚防瀏河。則白川雖以重兵來襲。欲府我軍之背。而瀏防已厚。亦不至退守也。奈何政府竟不發援。坐令三十二晝夜之血戰奇勳。隳於一旦。詎不大可痛耶。</p>
<h3>第二次的洪水</h3>
<p>— 黃人</p>
<p>英國最近大水爲患。因此引起一般科學家的研究。據一位專家研究所得。宣稱在三萬年或四萬年之内。將有第二次的洪水。使全世界盡成澤國。五大洲上。鹽水横掃而來。只有高原上或有一二片乾土。荷蘭國完全陸沈。英國的白金漢王宮與威斯明斯德大寺中。游焦往來。彷彿變成了水族館。因爲英倫全國。也大半在波濤中了。撒哈拉大沙漠。本來是亢旱異常的。到那時也變了滄海。紐約的幾十層高矗雲霄的高樓。只有頂尖露在</p>
<p>水面了。</p>
<p>又據一般科學家說。先前的冰時代ＬceAge還只過去了一半。現世界的氣候已轉變得煖熱起來。南北冰洋中的大冰巖已在漸漸地融解而冲到别的洋海中來。先前南北極的冰巖本有一千二百萬英里的面積。現已融去了一半。其他的一半倘再完全融解。全世界當然免不了一番變動。單以目前而論。英國二十五年前沿海的許多村落。都已没在水中。有一個地方　還可以看見禮拜堂的塔尖哩。</p>
<h3>暑天冷話</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>東三省變了顔然的版圖。漸漸地從國人糢糊的腦海中溜出去了。何怪大批日貨潮水般地湧到長江各埠。天下旣有如此不圖自振的廢科。日本亦何所愛於中國而不到熱河去顯一顯威武。甲說熱河已告危急。乙說熱河諒可無虞。尤其是南京方面。依然不脫風凉態度。只累得劉阿斗摸不着頭腦。暗中頻頻呌苦。</p>
<p>新鮮活死人。一對「大拉蘇」。牛蘭夫婦</p>
<p>得由假死而復活。實拜中國名流學者及黨國大員高唱人道主義之賜。的確。中國對待外國人是處處尊重人道的。你來。我退。你强硬。我軟化。你單刀直入。我迂迴遷延。無奈外國人對我們偏不尊重人道。你想有什麽辦法。</p>
<p>假使今年仍是命中註定再要嘗試一次水災苦况的話。我想還是聽憑災民去自生自滅的好。否則幾千萬外債買來的洋麥洋粉。無端的竟會變成了大龍洋去修理局長科長的五臟廟。實在是上千神怒。有犯天條。大可不必。</p>
<p>滬一變。至於洛。可是現在的洛陽。却又冷靜得多了。廬山牯嶺乃起而應人傑地靈之選。有人說。中國將來終有一天要逼到帕米爾高原去開會的。我想這句話大有哲理。帕米爾據說是黃帝子孫的發源地。樹高千丈。葉落歸根。本無足奇。只要這一交跌下去不致折頸而死。那就回到老巢去乘乘風凉。這又何妨。</p>
<h3>哀鴻淚語</h3>
<p>— 閣重樓</p>
<p>最近開映的國產影片「人道」。替一般饑寒無告的哀鴻呼籲。有很多的看了和我一樣的掉着眼淚。可知惻隠之心。人皆有之。其實「人道」對於災區的寫述。不過是一個很小的片段。陜西（我的故鄉）旱災的慘况。决非一篇文字或者一部影片所能盡述。在「人道」裏看見最悲慘的一幕是。因爲要救將死的阿公。不惜把自己親生的兒子換來一點糧米。這還没有</p>
<p>寫到人吃人。朋友吃朋友。親族吃親族所謂易子而食。在陜災劇烈的時期並不算一回希罕的事。</p>
<p>但陜災的造成。赤地數千里。死亡數百萬。這種慘况完全是因爲天時嗎。我在這裏要大膽的說一句。陜西旱災雖由於缺雨。但大部分却要歸咎於地方當局的苛政。因爲平常剝削得使人民没有一點兒積蓄。到了稍有旱象的時候。就弄到不可收拾了。據我所知。陜災中陜西農民最後在出賣農具。而陜西當局還在那時候購進大批的槍械。</p>
<p>陜民的苦况。言之不忍言。也覺不勝言了。最後我再向大衆告訴。陜西的旱象現在正是有增無减。單武功一縣。從前人口二十餘萬。現在只剩下七萬了。而那些良善的人民。惟有坐以待斃。希望政府當局和全國同胞。一致起來拯救孑遺呀。</p>

<h3>値得介紹的國貨工廠（十四）</h3>
<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>（二）（三）大理石廠</p>
<p>近時洋式木器。多以石質爲面。取其潔白不染油垢。我國仿洋木器。於是不得不購用之。每年漏巵。不在少數。其有花紋者。通稱大理石。純白者。曰礬石。以意大利來者爲上乘日本石次之。實則大理石。產自我國雲南。花紋自然。性質堅硬。非上項之所謂大理石可比。况價値頗昂。今且不易得大料。只可用之以鑲嵌揷屏掛屏等耳。</p>
<p>洋木器上所用之石料。我國近年亦有產生。而礬石產地尤。以山東來者爲大宗。聞初由德人發見。繼由日人經營之。待靑島收還。而該山開採權亦同時收歸國人矣。花石本須買自國外。前年有粤人唐姓。往湖州採石製石粉。無意中得花石山。惜色澤花紋均不及外貨光明淸楚。或以採自上而故。將來開掘至地下。當可較佳。亦未可知。價廉於外貨一半。市價毛坯每立方尺。價洋五元。磨光者。半寸厚之石。每平方尺價洋二元。上海愛多亞路有山海大理石公司。即機製此項石料。上海我國人之機製此業者。止此一家耳。去年營業。共計値洋三十餘萬元。該公司尚兼營人造石業務。不過人造石。近時上海業營造者。多能製之。已成極普通工業矣。不贅述。</p>
<p>（二）（四）化妝品工廠</p>
<p>製造化妝品。我國自古有名。讀阿房宮賦。可以想見秦宮粉黛之盛矣。近世物質文明。化妝品類。製造尤多。使舉其名。幾三百餘種。上海製造化妝品者。不計其數。有商標有工廠可調查者。約八十家。然其出品種類。有出十餘種者。有出七八種者。亦有祗出一二種者。以出品之多少。故資本定額至不一律。大者資本百餘萬元。小者祇數十元而已。有名者若家庭廣生永和香亞等廠是也。其出品有名者。如家庭工業社無敵牌牙粉。廣生雙美牌之花露水。中國化學工業社之三星牌雪花粉。永和實業社之月裏嫦娥牌牙膏。先施之千里香。美亞之美髮漿。大陸之雅箱。中法之孩兒面。中西之小姑娘。以及其他美星牌之香粉。金鐘牌之生髮油。鈔票牌之撲粉。秋月牌之毛撲。學生牌之香蜜等等。名目繁多。不勝枚舉。年銷本埠總計價洋四百萬元。外埠二百萬元。外洋進口者據民國十九年海關貿易册載。仍有四吉三百餘萬元之多。其數足以驚人矣。今設以小資本製造化妝品。則雪花膏凡士林等。尚可製造。牙粉雖亦毋須多大資本。然非有大量生產和推銷。不能賺錢。而裝璜一項。尤非雪花膏等可比。惟原料所用之炭酸鎂滑石粉薄荷精等。皆有國貨可購矣。自國貨牙粉發行。而日貨之金剛石獅子牌牙粉。市塲上竟爲之絶跡。此則不可謂非抵制之成功。差可自喜者也。</p>

<h3>鄭孝胥講亡道政治</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>鄭孝胥講的，原是日本化的王道政治，並不是亡道政治，其實鄭孝胥那裏會憧王道呢？那裏配講王道呢？他配講的只有亡道政治，到是他親身閱歷的過來人，所以我呌他講亡道政治。</p>
<p>前日某遺老謁溥儀歸來，詳述溥儀在長種種被日人監視情形，謂人言滿洲國爲傀儡政府，經余此次目擊，竊恐宣統尚傀儡之不若，直一張邦昌與徽欽二帝耳，而鄭孝胥如匏瓜之繫而不食，尚在所謂高級官吏養成所，大講其王道主義之政治，眞虧他講得出來，所以我說鄭孝胥只配講亡道政治，不配講王道政治。</p>
<p>溥儀名爲執政，無異監犯，本來不稱他皇帝，而稱他執政，原是很有意思的，執政之執，原是捉住的意思，就是捉住了使他秉政，所以溥儀的一舉一動，一言一語，全由日人監視，完全失掉自由，猶如從前門館中的學生，在嚴師監視之下，偶一與同學私語，一定要看看先生面孔，實是一樣，一不留意，夏楚隨之，溥儀現在的處境，就是如此，不知現在覺悟了麽？比較在天津時威風些麽？</p>
<p>鄭孝胥催掇老爺煨砂鍋，慫慂溥儀復辟，欲一過宰相之癮，現在你還轉來想想，不知滋味如何，本來他腦筋中的思想，還是漢借匈奴，唐借突厥，宋借契丹的一肚皮虫蛀螂　的我國一部舊歷史，現在要拿來應付當前的環境，眞是蠢才，眞是夢想，現在你滋味也嘗過了，虧你再講得出王道主義的政治，還是請示講些亡道主義的政治罷。</p>
<p>因此我更想到前日友人言，他也是自關外回來的，一日有某遺老進謁溥儀，中有「執政須自商量，大權不可旁落」之語，斯言即爲駒井所聞，立被傳去詢問，某遺老乃解釋其詞，謂所謂大權不可旁落，是指整個滿洲而言，不可懾於國聯之威勢，而有所改變也云云，乃赦之而去，又有某遺老，進謁溥儀，伏地涕泣不語，亦爲駒井所聞，傳詢，某遺老謂，佘感激涕零，無言可說，若無貴國帮忙，宣統安有今日，駒井乃微哂，令其速去。</p>
<p>我看了這種新聞。眞令我扼腕三嘆！</p>

<p>— 松甫</p>
<p>繁華十里是洋塲，散步公園好納凉，滾滾洪濤翻濁浪，陰陰夏木映埀楊，中西名點安排盛，潔白檯毯建設良，絡繹遊人添雅座，往來扇影動衣香，電燈閃爍增豪興，音樂悠揚感熱腸，此地浦灘頻眺望，不妨沾酒醉徜徉。</p>

<h3>黑色顔料的製法</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>黑色顔料如油烟（Ｌamp_black）,石墨，　烟（Ｃarbon　Black）,Dropblack等，都含有極多的炭質成分，牠們可以製農，印刷用墨汁，塗料等，用途極廣，牠們的製法是：</p>
<p>（一）油烟將油，樹脂，煤黑油，十炭稠輪質，十六炭稠輪質等富於炭質之物質，置於空氣有限之處，而燃燒之，即得油烟；其實，油烟就是烟煤（Ｓoot），平均含有炭百分之九八，其品質之優劣，視其粉末之大小而定</p>
<p>（二）石墨石墨是炭質同質體之一，有天然品，產於錫蘭，西伯里亞，加拿大，北美合衆國等地：亦有人造品，其製法是把無烟炭，骸炭或其他無定形炭質，於壓力極小之電爐中，以高温度熱之，即成人造石墨，這是亞哲生法（Ａchesom,s　Method),天然和人造石墨，都含有雜質，如石英，氣化鐵和礬土，不過天然石墨含雜質較多而炭質較少，大槪天然石墨含炭約百分之六○，人造石墨含炭百分之九○</p>
<p>（三）炭烟（即煤氣烟Ｇorblack）這種顔料，含有炭質約百分之九八至九九，其製法是把氣炭化物，如自然氣或亞羸質氣（Ｃ２Ｈ３），於空氣不流通之處，而燃燒之，即得炭烟。</p>
<p>（四）Ｄrop　Black這種顔料，包括葡萄烟（Ｖine　black）,（象牙烟）Ｉvoryblack),及ＦrrnkfortoBlack把各種原料，如象牙切下的廢物，葡萄芽，軟木塞所切下的，椰子殼等，於拑堝中熱之，坩堝中餘剩之殘基，含有原料之，部份炭放生局辦公重地</p>
<p>質，及燒後灰中之礦物質，礦物質中大部份是鉀的鹽類，能吸收濕氣，故ＤropBlack必須冲凈，後再乾燥，這種顔料，極黑，和油烟比較，油烟變成灰色了</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>改良男子服式的貢獻</h3>
<p>讀了張君滄粟的建議改良男子服式案後，深深地引起我的同情，不佞手癢，以我管見所及來貢獻些意見，</p>
<p>在人生四大要素中的衣服問題，原是很重要的，我國的服裝，雖則千變萬化，爭奇鬭艶的層出不窮，但是，大體依舊不改的長袍短褂，除了時新的改服西裝革履外，相沿習舊，一切的弊病，已由張君申述於前，無庸贅述了，現在我們確有急求改良的必要，但是單口說而没有具體的辦法，並且怎樣改良的服裝，認爲滿意而實用，非集多數人的詳密的規劃和討論，是不興的，現在把我個人的見解寫在下面，（一）適體衣服須以適體爲宜，如果修短不合和大小的不均，是要影響到一個人的精神和外貌的整潔，（二）雅觀服裝的外表，可以顯示出民族精神的喚發和衰落，</p>
<p>（三）經濟我國外受强鄰的侵掠，内被奸人的剝削，以致民窮財盡，故於衣服方面不得不力求節省，</p>
<p>（四）簡單服裝須簡單方便，不宜過於複雜呆笨，以免行旅的呆滯，而穿着費時，</p>
<p>基於上述原則，我以爲長袍削短而短褂放長，式樣仿照學生裝，唯其領頭參照中山裝式，褲子脚管瘦而加長，因爲西裝太過於複雜糜費，學生裝比較簡單然二臂行動太不靈便，而中服覺得寬大呆滯，因此襲人之長補已之短，將短褂加長中服領頭容易坍倒，故仿中山裝式，對於西式褲子臀部易破，反不如中式之二面掉換爲經濟，致於拙作如否適當，尚祈高明指示，此請改良社會討論會台鑒，會員許難公謹啓，</p>
<p>式樣如下圖</p>

<h3>招考新生</h3>
<p>— 曼倩</p>
<p>這是一般學校招考新生的情形：</p>
<p>新生們來應試的時候，大槪是衣冠端正的一頂草帽，一件夏布長衫。兩隻手裏，一手執着一柄摺扇，一手是挾着一包用新聞紙包着的應試文具。這樣斯斯文文的樣子，若同考取入校後的本來面目比一比，那完全變了兩個人！</p>
<p>招考的名額是二百名，可是實際報名考試的却不過一百零四人。</p>
<p>收着每一個投考者兩塊洋鈿報名費；在這樣熱的天氣中，却呌敎職員們來盡義務的監考，和考後的批閱卷子，在校長先生也說不過去，不得不忍痛的摸腰包，甜一甜敎職員們的嘴巴，請他們西瓜汽水，再是幾桌酒菜。免得他們背着人時唱着不平的怨曲！</p>
<p>體育指導時刻留意着的，有無運動員來投考？假若你在運動塲上出過風頭的話，雖然考的成績是不妙，但是不要緊，結果還是會入榜的！</p>
<p>校長先生留意着的：在新生的外表，若是西裝革履，一身的摩登裝束，那他就怕你的會活動，閙風潮。雖然你的成績是考的怎樣好，但結果是没希望錄取！反之，你若是土頭土腦，鄉氣十足，那校長先生們將對你表示十二分的歡迎和同情！</p>
<p>第一樣是數學試騐，到第二項物理試騐的時候，少了十三個，到最後口試的辰光，祇剩了八十二人！</p>
<p>考數學繳白卷的佔了全數三分之一，還有三分之一雖然是胡亂的塗了一些，然而結果仍是等於不做。餘剩的三分之一，比較起來是很好的了，可是成績却一個没有超過六十分的！新生考試成績的結果，總平均成績及格的祗有一個，剛巧是勉强的凑滿了六十分，在五十分以上的，也不過僅僅四人，因爲這樣，錄取的標準可就難訂了，最後經幾度商酌的結果說：總平均在三十分以上的，一律在被取之列，但是計算起來，也不過三十七名，最後仍遞補了三名總平均在二十八分以上的，才算凑滿了四十人！</p>
<p>因爲預定招考名額的不足，於是不得不儘量的舉行第二第三……次的招考了。當然的，情形還是和第一次招考一樣。</p>
<p>家庭問題</p>
<h3>拔頭頸</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>隔壁綽號小財神的徐老兒，在昨天夜裏，患時疫死了，他生前克勤克儉，創上了十萬的家產，因爲是一個愛財若命的創家業的人，所以活了四十多年，從没有過好吃好著，他祗知道年年買田買屋，增厚自己的資產，對於地方上一切的公益的慈善的事情，何嘗肯拔一毛，人們見他這樣的爲富不仁，雖則綽號他小財神，但是背地裏都呌他守財奴哩。</p>
<p>他雖則創了不少的家產，但是到死尚抱伯道之憂，因爲年紀還不及半百，所以尚希望娶妾生子，故而對於族中建議立嗣繼承問題，立時表示拒絶，那知天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福，他還没曾達到娶妾生子的目的，就丢了偌大的家產而死了。</p>
<p>他一旦不曾辦妥天年後的事情而急病身亡，那就起了絶大的糾紛了，他的死耗傳出之後，族中的子侄輩，都三脚兩步地跑來，翻箱倒篋，搜攫財產契據，一時你爭我奪，大家都拚命的祇顧搜羅財產，對於死在床上已有一天了的他的屍體，倒大家視若無睹，直到所有的現蓄，被這般像活强盜般的子姪，囊括凈盡以後，想到不動產是嗣子的權利時，大家纔爲了財產而趨攏來和他料理身後。</p>
<p>鄉間習俗，當屍身入棺時，捧頭爲嗣子的工作，也是算爲何人承繼遺產的一種應有的表示，所以有親生子的人，死了之後，捧頭問題，當然不生枝節，倘若是個後嗣尚虛的人，那末這個捧頭問題，每每閙得烏烟瘴氣，現在徐老兒，也是這個局景，幾位姪兒，你要立嗣，我要承繼，紛紛擾擾，閙到徐老兒攤在床三天，還不曾解决，但是暑天炎熱，屍體怎能擱得上幾天，所以到第三天，他的姪少爺們的捧頭問題，還未解决時，他的屍體，已應了（六月裏死人爛好人）的話而腐化了。</p>
<p>到了第四天下午，這個大問題，仍舊不曾解决，但是一般親友們，都埋怨幾位姪少爺，你們爭奪遺產，儘可待入殮之後，再開談判，不當把死的難爲，幾位姪少爺聽了，也以爲長此延擱下去，總究不是事體，况且天熱，已經臭氣冲天，若再不去成殮，豈不要化成血水了，於是都答應親戚的要求，命土工和徐老兒更依換帽，那知一切手續完了，土工正在把屍身從床上扛到棺裏去的時候，幾位姪少爺，個個心中恐怕捧不着頭，後來奪不着遺產，所以都一股兒飛也似的擁上去，揪住老兒的觸髏，一時人多手雜，已經腐化的髑髏，被十多隻手抓來抓去，卜通一聲，徐老兒的吃飯傢伙，在幾位姪少爺的你捧我抓的暴力下，而身首異處了。</p>
<p>唉！可憐徐老兒，數十年辛辛苦苦，創了上十萬的遺產，結果祗落得一個身首異處。</p>

<h3>Komai Tokuzo Resigns</h3>
<p>Inevitable thoughts of the puppet show that is the Northeastern pseudo-state lead one to think of Komai Tokuzo, the man pulling the strings from behind the scenes. Komai Tokuzo, as a Japanese national, holds the position of Director-General of the General Affairs Office of the so-called State Council of the pseudo-state, and controls the entire operation of the pseudo-state.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Tokyo-Changchun, Komai will be forced to fly back to Tokyo to resolve his resignation. For a major official of a so-called independent pseudo-state, the issue of his resignation must be resolved in Tokyo. I don’t want to elaborate on this bizarre scene in the puppet show, but the reason for Komai's resignation is something that we need to pay close attention to. Komai had to resign because the views of the civilian officials and the military in Tokyo diverged. When he left Changchun, he stated that upon arriving in Tokyo, he would frankly and openly express his beliefs regarding the situation in Manchuria to seek understanding from the authorities, and expressed his willingness to devote himself to the task of governing Manchuria. His desire to cling to his position was clearly evident. However, the Japanese cabinet and the military had already agreed on a successor before Komai even arrived, and because the military insisted on opposing the succession of anyone with liberal leanings, they rejected Saito Prime Minister's aide Maruyama as Komai's successor, leading to a dispute between the cabinet and the military. Is Komai resigning because he is considered to be leaning towards liberalism and is therefore unacceptable to the military? Can Komai even be considered to be leaning towards liberalism?</p>
<p>Komai initially graduated from the Sapporo Imperial University's Department of Agriculture. In 1911, he earned a bachelor's degree in agriculture for his dissertation, "A Treatise on Manchurian Soybeans." The following year, he joined the South Manchuria Railway Company and was recognized by those in authority. It was proposed to give him a large sum of money to send him to Europe for inspection, but due to his firm request, he was instead assigned to inspect all of China, investigating the industries of various regions, with a particular focus on the economy of our entire Northeastern territory. This lasted for four years. The authorities at the South Manchuria Railway changed, and the new authorities did not attach importance to Komai's reports. Komai then resolutely left. He later served in the Tokyo Foreign Ministry, but his ambitions to invade our Northeast were never forgotten. After the September 18th Incident, he jumped to become the true ruler of the Northeastern pseudo-state as the financial advisor to the Japanese Kwantung Army. He devoted twenty long years to the work of invading our Northeast. The fact that he managed a vast 690,000-ping farm in Gongzhuling astonished the League of Nations investigation team. From this, we can see the long-term planning of those who implement Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>The reason Komai was forced to resign may be due to the Japanese military's dissatisfaction with his statements to the League of Nations investigation team. The investigation team paid close attention to whether the pseudo-state was maintaining the open-door policy in the Northeast, and while Komai claimed to be maintaining the open-door policy, he also expressed his rejection of so-called flawed capitalism and capitalists, and also rejected Japanese capitalists. This was a major departure from the domestic Japanese frenzy for an aggressive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia, and was mistakenly perceived by Japanese soldiers as opposition to the policy of annexing Manchuria and Mongolia. However, Komai regarded his own work as the first step in enabling Japan to realize its new continent policy, and yet he was still dissatisfied with the military and was rejected by the military. From this, we can see the ferocity of the Japanese military's conspiracies and plans.</p>
<p>If Komai is indeed a person with liberal leanings, then the characteristics of Japanese liberalism can be seen in a glimpse. However, Yūsuke Tsurumi is a thorough and complete liberal political commentator. His remarks at the Pacific Conference last year have already made us question the meaning of liberalism. Komai is therefore not surprising. What I find regrettable about Komai's affairs is that the liberal figures of the enemy country are like this, while the figures in our country who call themselves liberals have actually proposed the notion of "adapting to the facts" at a time when the enemy is actively invading, seeking peace from the enemy that cannot be obtained. Alas, is this the characteristic of liberalism in our country?</p>

<h3>Jehol Still Serious</h3>
<p>Zhang Asks the Central Government for Financial Assistance</p>
<p>The Righteous Army Demands Ransom Money for Ishimoto</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei received a telegram from Zhang Xueliang on the 28th night stating that the Chaoyang telephone was still out of service and the situation on the front line remained serious. Wang presented the telegram and discussed it at the administrative meeting on the 29th. It was decided that Zhang was currently summoning the generals of North China to discuss plans to resist the insult. After the meeting has results and reports to the Central Government, further discussions will be held. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin repeatedly telegraphed reports on the situation in Jehol. Zhang has forwarded them to the Central Government. The generals of North China are discussing the Jehol matter and have decided on the following: (1) Telegraph the Central Government for instructions; (2) Jehol is in a tense situation and needs money urgently. Please ask the Central Government to find a way to provide assistance. The Central Government replied to Zhang and encouraged Tang to work hard to defend the country and protect the territory. Zhang has forwarded the original telegram to Chengde. The assistance funds are temporarily set at 2 million yuan, and the Jehol representative and Zhang will jointly telegraph the Central Government for contact. Chaoyang, Lingyuan, Anjing, and Beipiao are still garrisoned by the Jehol army. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, when asked about the rumor that Japanese troops were planning to attack Jehol and invade the Beiping-Tianjin area at the Japanese Embassy here, the response was that "We are currently closely monitoring Zhang Xueliang's troops." When asked for a clearer response, the person at the embassy shook their head and did not answer. According to unverified news from Shenyang, a large number of Japanese troops have been transferred from northern Manchuria to the Jehol border. However, the Japanese Embassy denied this news today, saying that there are only 5,000 Japanese troops in the Jinzhou-Chaoyang area, and they have not been expanded so far. The reason for asking the Japanese Embassy about the above question is that the Japanese side has been spreading rumors in recent days that the Japanese army will soon destroy Zhang Xueliang's base in Beiping because Zhang is related to the Manchurian Volunteer Army and because troops have been sent from Beiping to Jehol. Even the Tianjin Japanese Information Bureau, which usually publishes the opinions of the Japanese military, has spread this rumor. In fact, Zhang Xueliang's troops have never left the Great Wall. According to the attitude of foreign political circles, although the rumors are rampant, no accidents have occurred so far. It is credible that the Japanese army will soon invade the Beiping-Tianjin area. However, unexpected events may occur. This place and Jehol are all areas of concern, so the overall situation should be given serious attention. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Ishimoto incident, which almost became a second Nakamura incident and focused attention, was resolved through repeated negotiations between the Japanese garrison and Qi Zifeng, the representative of Tang Yulin, for his release. As a result of Qi's negotiations with the Volunteer Army, Ishimoto was released yesterday and can return to Shenyang from Jinzhou today. (29th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to today's news from Jinzhou, the leader of the Volunteer Army in Jehol, Ben Ding, suddenly changed his mind this morning before handing over Ishimoto, and demanded a ransom payment before releasing him. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>White Russians in Eastern Province Plan to Organize a White Russian Army</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The bandit atmosphere is rampant and battles occur frequently. Traffic on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is paralyzed. These factors have created a serious state of anxiety among the residents. Those who are particularly affected are the Russians. Therefore, eight White Russian organizations here have written to Fu Yi, Honjo Shigeru, and others, requesting permission to organize a self-defense force of 10,000 people, with Qi Jifu, a White Russian military officer who previously served in the Russian army, as the commander. Near Harbin, banditry is intensifying. On the 25th of this month, a band of fierce bandits abducted five railway workers in Songpu, including three employees of the South Manchuria Railway and the rest were employees of the Hulan-Hailun Railway. The bandits demanded a ransom of 1.5 million yuan, but they could not get their wish because the amount was too large and difficult to raise. According to Japanese sources, the cavalry of the Japanese army and the Manchurian army will jointly surround the troops of Ma Zhanshan who are currently retreating north to Hailun. It is rumored that 2,000 Manchurian soldiers stationed at Ujim River have revolted and responded to the anti-Manchu army, and have dispatched 300 people to attack the Japanese armored train near Ujim. According to the Japanese, the Japanese soldiers suffered two deaths and one injury in this battle, while the rebel soldiers suffered seven deaths and injuries and were defeated and retreated.

<h3>Qingdao Mayor Welcomes the Shanghai Inspection Group</h3>
<p>The Jiao-Ji Railway Committee is at the Reception</p>
<p>Hoping That the Chinese People Will Return the Jiao-Ji Railway Japanese Debt</p>
<p>(Qingdao) On the evening of the 28th, Mayor Shen hosted a banquet for the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Inspection Group. The heads of various municipal government bureaus, the councilors, the members of the municipal party headquarters, the chairman and standing committee of the municipal chamber of commerce, and leaders of the industry and commerce community accompanied him. The mayor delivered a speech, welcoming the leaders of the Shanghai industry and commerce community, as well as Zhang Jiluan, the editor of the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, and Pan Gongzhan, the president of the Shanghai Morning Post, to Qingdao for inspection. He hoped that after the inspection, they would provide many instructions and help Qingdao's development. Wang Xiaolai, the representative of the inspection group, delivered a reply, listing the history of the opening of Jiaozhou and the past achievements of Germany and Japan in managing the city. He hoped that Qingdao would have social stability in the future, absorb the financial and talent resources of the whole country, increase the production of Shandong's products, facilitate Qingdao's transportation, and develop the sale industry, especially focusing on the promotion of national capital. Finally, he expressed his gratitude, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The inspection group held a meeting at the guest house at 9 am on the 29th to discuss and decide on the inspection and tour schedule. They set off in groups in the afternoon. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) In the afternoon of the 28th, the inspection group publicly visited various institutions of the municipal government, chamber of commerce, and Jiaoji Railway Bureau. Lu Mengtai, the commissioner of the Jiao-Ji Railway, reported at the reception tea party that the Japanese debt of the Jiao-Ji Railway was 40 million Japanese yen and that there were still five years before it must be paid off, and that the Chinese people seemed to have forgotten about it. The Jiao-Ji Railway can now make a profit of about 5-6 million yuan each year. After four years, it will only be one-third of the debt. He hoped that the Chinese people would pay attention to this and raise public bonds to repay the debt at once. Alternatively, the annual profits could be kept in custody to serve as a fund for the principal and interest of public bonds. However, the Japanese predict that the Chinese people's five-minute enthusiasm for the Jiao-Ji Railway has passed and that it will be difficult to repay the debt when the time comes, so they may use this as an excuse to reoccupy it. Wang Rutang said that if the Jiao-Ji Railway returns to the hands of the Japanese, it will have a great impact on North China. Wang Xiaolai should urge the industry, commerce, and financial circles of Shanghai to pay attention to this. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Chen Guangfu, Dai Gengxin, Zhang Jiongbo, Xie Zhongheng, and Yu Qiaqing will also join the inspection group. Because Mayor Shen Guang has agreed to the Three Northern Shipping Company's Qingdao route, it will be protected in the same way as foreign ships. (29th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Chaos in Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>Increasing Strife Between Civil and Political Parties</p>
<p>Ugaki and Adachi Seize Opportunity to Stir Up Trouble</p>
<p>The Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun reports that the National Policy Research Club, centered on Adachi Kenzō, has been actively operating recently. Twenty-two members of parliament have already joined, and it is expected that at least thirty members will join. Adachi is still working hard to win over comrades, preparing to overthrow the current cabinet and realize a truly unified and powerful national cabinet. Currently, Mr. Nakano Seigō is beginning major activities as the backbone, and will propose measures to save the current situation at the provisional parliament. Therefore, the Saitō cabinet will inevitably suffer a fatal blow. Around the beginning of autumn will be the time for political transition. On the other hand, Hiranuma, Kuhara, Akita, and the military are gradually approaching an agreement. Various parties are working very hard to stir up trouble. For example, Ugaki, the Governor-General of Korea, is also eager to resign from his position as Governor-General and prepare to engage in political activities. Ugaki had already shown signs of this during the Inukai cabinet era due to the issue of the Director-General Imai Tada. Recently, due to changes in the political situation, the civil and political parties have become increasingly divided, and the Makiyama, Kawasaki, Yorinuki, Suzuki, Ikeda, Sakuta, Ogawa, Nishimura, and others within the Minseito party are strongly urging Ugaki to join the party as the next president. Therefore, Ugaki's intentions have been greatly moved. The anti-Wakatsuki sentiment among the Minseito faction in the House of Peers is also growing stronger. Therefore, the brewing of the political situation is becoming increasingly chaotic.</p>

<h3>U.S. Veterans Riot</h3>
<p>Throwing Bricks at Police</p>
<p>Troops Deployed to Suppress the Situation</p>
<p>Tear Gas Used to Clear the Chaos, Barracks Set Ablaze</p>
<p>Veterans Empty-Handed Retreat from Washington</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 28th – Veterans who have been camping out in the open in the capital for weeks, demanding that the government issue bonus certificates for cash, have suddenly clashed with the police. The veterans threw bricks at the police, who returned fire, causing a serious situation. All the police in the American capital were gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue and other major thoroughfares. In the afternoon, the authorities deployed troops to suppress the situation. A cavalry unit rushed across the Potomac River and headed towards the White House. Upon arrival, they found the police struggling to control the chaos. Two hundred cavalry soldiers and a company of infantry, carrying several machine guns and five armored vehicles, were stationed around the White House, hoping to quickly quell the turmoil. The situation was at its worst this afternoon, but after the soldiers used tear gas, they dispersed the veterans.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 28th – After the troops were deployed near the White House, the infantry advanced quickly with fixed bayonets, dispersing the veterans. Some were unwilling to continue retreating, so the infantry put on gas masks and threw tear gas bombs at the shouting and cursing crowd. Blue smoke filled the air, and the veterans scrambled to escape. The infantry led the way, followed by tanks, clearing the buildings occupied by the veterans. A fire broke out in the temporary shacks where the veterans lived, and the fire brigade was dispatched to extinguish it. An inspection revealed three police officers and one soldier injured, while one veteran was killed and six injured. After the veterans were driven out of Washington, the troops were ordered to clear the veterans' main camp five miles from Washington, where 7,000 veterans lived. The troops first helped 380 women and 488 children out, then used tear gas to disperse the remaining crowd, and then set fire to their tents. More than fifty people were injured on both sides. This operation was commanded by General MacArthur, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. National News Agency, Washington, 28th – Today's disturbance began when federal government personnel, accompanied by police, evicted veterans squatting in federal government buildings. Eighteen people advocated resistance, and one climbed onto the roof, waving a flag and calling for support. Veteran leader Walter Waters had agreed to withdraw yesterday and gave a speech urging a peaceful retreat, but the crowd did not listen and rushed past the police cordon, seizing a pile of bricks and engaging in a brick battle with the police for ten minutes. Police Inspector General Glassford, known as a friend of the veterans, was also hit in the chest by a brick, but was not injured. Two police officers were seriously injured and immediately sent to the hospital. In addition, several police officers and many veterans suffered minor injuries, and many veterans were arrested.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 28th – The U.S. government authorities have taken decisive action on the long-unresolved veteran relief issue. Yesterday, President Hoover summoned the Secretary of War and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, etc., to discuss in detail the legislative and legal issues of evicting these veterans. It seems that the government has decided to take direct action to deal with the situation. Therefore, cavalry, infantry, and tank units were ordered to advance on the veterans stationed in the government offices on Pennsylvania Avenue. The veterans not only refused to withdraw, but also expressed their intention to resist with force. The army then released tear gas into their encampment. The veterans in the buildings could not stay long and scattered. The wind suddenly changed direction, causing hundreds of onlookers to faint. They were all taken to the hospital by the rescue team. When the soldiers fled from the public buildings, fires broke out in many places. It is thought that the soldiers set the fires before leaving, so many people were arrested and will be prosecuted for arson. When the army began to attack the veterans, they were all armed with command swords and bayonets, etc. A large part of the audience were also veterans residing elsewhere, so the cavalry had to try their best to disperse the crowd, sometimes beating the crowd with the backs of their swords. The veterans' weapons were mostly bricks and stones. At that time, someone fired several pistol shots, but it is still unknown if anyone was injured. The person leading the government troops was Chief of Staff MacArthur, who commanded everything on horseback. The casualties in this battle included one death and more than twenty injuries, including three seriously injured. One veteran's ear was cut off by a cavalry command sword. The matter was soon calmed down. General MacArthur declared that he must also evict the residents of the houses in Anacostia Highlands tonight, because there are still about 5,000 men, women, and children who are determined to stay. Afterwards, Walter Waters, the commander of the veterans' departure team, said to the people, "Since this matter was ordered by the President, every drop of blood we shed can be offered under the White House."</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 28th – The veterans have completely withdrawn from Washington tonight, and under the drive of bayonets and machine guns, they have flocked to Baltimore, which is the only way the army left for the veterans to leave the capital. Before the withdrawal, Walter Waters, the commander-in-chief of the veterans' petition group, discussed with the commander of the reception center, Atwell. Waters advocated following the order to withdraw, claiming that it was useless for the veterans to fight against bullets with their bare hands. So the women and children immediately set off, and the men lingered unwilling to leave immediately. When the army arrived, the commander of the reception center, Atwell, alone held a white flag and came out to ask the army commander for an hour's grace, which was granted. The veterans packed up everything and sadly set off at about 10 o'clock at night. Many of the onlookers on the roadside shed tears for them.</p>
<h3>Japan Rejects Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Using Anti-Japanese Movement as Pretext</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 29th – Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, most of the students studying in Japan have returned to their countries, some of whom have stayed behind to engage in the anti-Japanese movement. As a result of a secret investigation by the Foreign Affairs Division of the Metropolitan Police Department, it was discovered that Tian Xiangpan, a graduate of Toyama School who had attained the rank of colonel, was directing the anti-Japanese movement in Tokyo. Therefore, on the 25th, the Minister of Home Affairs expelled him from the country on the charge of engaging in the anti-Japanese movement. He was escorted from Tokyo Station to Kobe at 7 p.m. yesterday and will be escorted back to China on the Kamakura Maru from Kobe on the 30th.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Kanazawa, 29th – Recently, Chinese people living in the Hokuriku region organized the Hokuriku branch of the Chinese Association, intending to instigate anti-Japanese plans in Japan according to the orders of their home country in the event of an emergency. This matter was discovered by the Tsuruga Military Police, and they are now secretly investigating. It seems that there are active Chinese officers behind this, deliberately taking an attitude that harms Sino-Japanese relations and will be dealt with accordingly.</p>

There are more than a dozen types of foreign goods with increased imports this year, with raw materials being the most significant. From January to May, the import of raw cotton was worth 251,455,000 yuan, compared to 166,889,000 yuan in the same period last year. The import of iron plates was approximately double that of the previous year, and the import of aluminum was approximately seven times higher than last year. In the past five months, the Japanese goods with increased exports were primarily cotton yarn, which increased approximately three times, as well as rayon. The export of rayon textiles increased by approximately four million yuan.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Communist Case in Ningxiang, Hunan Province</h3>
<p>Central Investigation Committee Has Arrived in Hunan</p>
<p>The Clearing Department Announces the Course of the Case</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence – After the Communist case in Ningxiang, Hunan Province, occurred, the provincial Party and government authorities attached great importance to it and repeatedly reported it to the Central Government, requesting that senior officials be sent to Hunan to thoroughly investigate the case. The Central Government also considered the case to be of great importance and sent Committee Member Fang Juehui and Committee Member Hong Ludong to Hunan. The two committee members, Fang and Hong, arrived in the province by express train on the morning of the 20th at 9:00 a.m. After getting off the train, they went to the Youth Association to rest with Chairman He and others. They immediately began actively collecting the case files and have now transferred and stored the various case files of the Provincial Party Department's Clearing Department regarding this case for review, hoping to appropriately resolve the case as soon as possible. As for the details of the case's occurrence and the Clearing Department's handling process, the Clearing Command announced the details yesterday, the text of which is quite lengthy and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Past Bandit Situation in Ningxiang – Investigation shows that Ningxiang is the birthplace of the main Red bandits Xie Juecai, He Shuheng, Wang Lingbo, etc. The Red bandits have had organizations there for a long time. After the Ma-Ri Incident, more than 700 Red bandits in the county declared their surrender, many of whom pretended to surrender and secretly worked in various sectors. In addition, the local bandit leaders Yan Ruoqiao, Xu Shangda, Zhong Jie, Cai Zhengbiao, etc., organized the Central Hunan Pseudo-Guerrilla Team, which disturbed the area and greatly affected the province's security. Moreover, the county's Party Department had a complex internal structure and repeatedly published statements against the Central and local governments. It also colluded with former county magistrate Li Jiapu and former Security Brigade Commander Wu Dongcheng under the guise of appeasement, which strengthened the bandit forces, leading to frequent incidents of robbing guns from various township bureaus. (Investigation reveals that the Tongwen Town and Gaolu Township bureaus suffered heavy losses. According to a report by former Brigade Commander Wu Dongcheng, the Gaolu Bureau was robbed by bandits of 16 rifles, 1 Mauser pistol, 1 square pistol, more than 100 rounds of ammunition, 1 generator, 22 sets of military uniforms, and all symbol flags, etc. The Tong Bureau was robbed by bandits of 24 rifles, 4 pistols, more than 800 rounds of ammunition, etc. None of the bureaus resisted, and the bandits only numbered about 20 each time they robbed the bureaus' guns, and they only carried a few guns and sticks. A small number of bandits robbed a large number of guns, etc.) ○ Seeing this situation, the Clearing Command reorganized the county's Security Brigade and established the Yiyang, Xiangxiang, Ningxiang, and Anhua Bandit Suppression Command to jointly encircle and suppress the bandits, in order to achieve a thorough suppression.</p>
<p>Clues to Uncovering the Case – Investigation shows that on May 4 this year, the Public Security Bureau of the Hunan Provincial Capital cracked the Wang Wu case of the Pseudo-Changsha Municipal Committee and found many Red bandit plots and secret notices in its organization. Among them was a notice directing the work of the Pseudo-Guerrilla Team, stating that its main task was to assist in the riots of its people, and that the Guerrilla Team must use these materials to publicize and agitate on various revolutionary anniversaries and special events, such as the current anti-Japanese and flood disasters. Because the suspect was stubborn and unwilling to confess the details, he was executed according to the law. Subsequently, the Red bandit wanted criminal Mei Chongdong, also known as Mei Zhongdong, was arrested in Xiangtan, and a pistol, ammunition, and evidence of extortion were seized on the spot. After the Clearing Command brought him to trial, he confessed that he was the commander of the Pseudo-Guerrilla Team and, like the executed bandit leader Wang Wu, had received a mission from the Pseudo-Central Committee to come to Hunan. He knew the Red bandit organization situation in the county quite well and had the potential to solve the case. Therefore, members of the special service team were ordered to escort him to Ningxiang County to search for bandit guns and arrest the remaining members, and the Ningxiang County government and Security Brigade were ordered to assist at any time.</p>
<p>Progress After Uncovering the Pseudo-Organization – After the special service team members escorted the bandit suspect to Ningxiang, they uncovered the Pseudo-County Committee organization in Shaohu Xinwu and arrested a Pseudo-County Committee member, Xiao Meiyu.</p>
<p>Then, the bandits Yang Baosheng, Yang Shousheng, Xiao Jinghai, Chen Shulin, Wang Bangheng, etc., were arrested one after another. In the Youzhayuan Primary School in Tongwen Town, where the surrendered Communist Party member Chen Yuchu was the speaker, 7 rifles and 699 rounds of ammunition were seized. According to the confession of the Pseudo-</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>County Committee, there were many accomplices, and Xiao Xuetai, a member of the Ningxiang County Party Department, and Huang Xigong (a native of Ningxiang), an alternate member of the Hunan Provincial Party Department, were said to be separately responsible for spying on the news of the Provincial and County governments and reporting it at any time. In Xiao Xuetai's residence, two pieces of secret evidence were seized. The Bandit Suppression Commander Cao Mingzhen, Security Brigade Commander Zhu Dingsan, County Magistrate Zhao Ming, etc., jointly arrested Xiao Xuetai and the suspect Yu Kexiang, etc. The Hunan Clearing Command immediately dispatched Enforcement Division Chief Li Qiong, along with Enforcement Officer Tan Ruizhang and Secretary Xiang Zongli, to investigate the matter. It was then reported urgently by the commanders that the Provincial Party Department should be requested to come. After interrogation, three points were decided: (1) The crimes of the five bandits Wang Bangheng, Yang Shousheng, Yang Baosheng, Xiao Jinghai, and Chen Shulin were clearly proven and had nothing to do with the Party and government, so they were executed on the spot according to the law. (2) The suspects Wen Ximo, Liao Xingchun, and Liu Feifei had lighter offenses and were allowed to be released on bail pending trial. Yu Shilong was temporarily placed under the custody of the Ningxiang County government pending interrogation because his school expenses were not clear. (3) Xiao Xuetai, Xia Wenbin, Wang Lingxiao, Li Jifu, Yu Shuyan</p>
<p>· Yu Kexiang, etc., were taken to the province for trial. The Pseudo-Military Committee member Mei Chongdong was then escorted to capture the Pseudo-Guerrilla Team leader Deng Shutqi, team members He Shaokun, Zhong Xiangui (Zhong Jie's younger brother), and suspects Chen Luoshi, etc., in Guojia Lane, Changsha City. A Mauser pistol and 30 rounds of ammunition were seized in Yongxing Street, Chezhan Lane. Then, the bandit suspect Deng Shutqi was escorted to Ningxiang, and 6 Mauser pistols and 207 rounds of ammunition were seized in the Donghutang Dawuwan organization, and the harboring bandit Yang Hanchen was arrested. The remaining criminals supplied by the criminals Xiao Meiyu and Mei Chongdong have been dispatched in teams to Xiangtan, Hankou and other places to arrest. All investigation situations have been sent to the Hunan Provincial Party Department for verification and reported to the Central Government.</p>
<p>Recent Conspiracy of Red Bandits – According to the confession of County Committee member Xiao Meiyu, the Communist Party in China has spread all over the area north of the Yellow River, and the Red areas are divided into Central areas, namely, the counties in eastern, western and southern Jiangxi, as well as the Hubei-Henan-Anhui area, the western Hubei-Hunan area, the Guangdong-Fujian area and various guerrilla areas, the Dongting area (the nine counties bordering Dongting Lake) and the central Hunan area (namely, Ningxiang, Anhua, Yiyang, Xiangxiang, and Xiangtan). He also confessed that the military actions of the Red Army were temporarily aimed at seizing one or several provinces in China as a base, and that the plan for this year was to seize the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi as a base. He also confessed that we had resolved at the time to divide an area near Xu Zhisheng and an area in Xiangtan Ruyiting (Area Committee, Peng Zhuofu), an area in Shitan Township (Area Committee, Zhou Yongxi), a branch in the Tang Clan School (Tang Zhaohong in charge), and a branch in Zhongjia Chong, Wazi Peng, Xiangtan. He also confessed that the pseudo-guerrilla members in Ningxiang mostly lived in the Xiaowumen Machang area. Most of the communists in the provincial capital were cart drivers, power plant workers and spinning mill workers. They held meetings in the mountains in the suburbs and on boats on the water and on Tianxin Pavilion Ring City Road, etc. Based on this investigation, the Red Bandits' offensive in Hunan is actually an entire scheme, and the central Hunan barrier province, especially the provincial capital, is very important. If it is brewed for a long time, then the disease will be born from the armpit, and the hidden dangers will be more serious.</p>
<p>Reactionary Remarks in Ningxiang People's Newspaper – Investigation shows that the Ningxiang People's Newspaper, sponsored by the Ningxiang Party Department, has repeatedly published remarks against the Central and local governments, such as the Provincial News and Revolutionary Views After the Launch of the Anti-Chiang Front. It also advocated reactionary remarks, such as claiming that those who speak are innocent and requesting to telegram that those who advocate disobedience to conscription warlords should lead the masses to carry out tax resistance movements and see how warlords save the crisis of society, etc. As for the trial situation of this case, we will wait for detailed announcement.

<h3>Annulment of the Qiong Special District System</h3>
<p>Marine Corps Relieved by Guards Brigade After Leaving Qiong</p>
<p>Chen Zhangfu Concurrently Appointed Pacification Commissioner of Qiongya</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Following Cai Tingkai's mediation of the Qiong affair, the 19th Route Army's Brigade Commander Tan Qixiu was dispatched to Qiong to handle the transfer of defenses between the two sides. Chen Ce's Marine Corps was originally scheduled to leave Qiong as soon as possible. However, due to the delayed arrival of the merchant ships "Hai Shun" and "Guang Li," which were chartered to Qiong to transport troops, and the insufficient allocation of ships, the departure was postponed until the 20th of this month. Only one battalion was left behind to withdraw after the relieving troops arrived. According to Tan Qixiu's telegram late on the 20th, Chen Jitang's directly subordinate Guards Brigade from Leizhou had arrived on Qiong Island on the night of the 20th. The Marine Corps completely departed for Xiamen on the morning of the 21st. Furthermore, Chen Hanguang, the Guards Brigade Commander, telegraphed at 7 PM on the afternoon of the 20th, stating that the advance troops of his brigade would arrive at Dongshui Port that night and proceed to the old city of Chengmai to camp. On the 21st, a special service battalion would be dispatched, using vehicles hired by the Chamber of Commerce, to Haikou to take over defenses, etc. On the morning of the 21st, the Marine Corps departed from Haikou on the four ships "Jia He," "Yu Shun," "Guang Li," and "Ding An." Tan Qixiu, having completed the procedures for the Marine Corps, returned to the provincial capital during the day to report the progress to Chen Jitang, and then proceeded to Fujian Province to preside over military affairs. Upon investigation, He Baoshu's detachment, the second regiment of Chen Hanguang's Brigade advance troops, arrived in Haikou on the afternoon of the 20th, and was subsequently ordered to proceed to Qiongdong, Wenchang, and Jiaji to be stationed. After the remaining units, Chen Hanguang's first regiment and Peng Zhifang's third regiment, arrived in Qiong, Chen's regiment was stationed in Lingao and Chengmai, and Peng's regiment was stationed in Ganen, Lingshui, and Yaxian. The special service battalion and brigade headquarters were stationed in Qiongzhou Prefecture city. As for the issue of governance in Qiongya, the current intention of the Guangdong authorities is to establish a Qiongya Pacification Commissioner's Office in Qiong, under the command and supervision of the First Army Group and the provincial government. It has already been internally decided that Chen Zhangfu will concurrently serve as Commissioner of the Qiongya Pacification Office. As Qiongya borders the Southern District, having Chen manage the Qiong affairs will facilitate measures. Chen has already been ordered to dispatch personnel to Qiong to prepare for the establishment of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and he himself will personally proceed to Qiongzhou from Leizhou within days to make arrangements. It is rumored that the Qiongya Pacification Office will be established on August 1st. Furthermore, at the provincial affairs meeting on the 21st, the Department of Civil Affairs proposed to appoint a new batch of county magistrates for Qiongya. The county magistrates for Qiongdong County, Qiongshan County, Chengmai County, Dingan County, Wanning County, and Changjiang County have already been approved for replacement. These newly appointed county magistrates have been ordered to proceed to take office immediately. In view of this, since the Qiongya Pacification Office has already been established and the Department of Civil Affairs has also appointed new county magistrates for the various counties of Qiongya, the so-called Qiongya Special District system has been implicitly abolished. Wu Chaochu, the Chief Executive of the Qiongya Special District, sent a letter to Chen Jitang some time ago, but Chen has not yet replied. Yesterday, a certain senior official was dispatched to Hong Kong to communicate with Wu on all matters. Wu intends to go north with Chen Ce during the day. The Qiongya Special District has, in fact, been abolished, and the Southern Route issue, which has been a source of disturbance for over a month, has thus been completely resolved. (July 23rd)</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in the Suppression of Bandits in Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Northeast Jiang Area Tightens Security</p>
<p>Southern Jiangxi's Defenses are Very Solid</p>
<p>Yu Hanmou Commands Troops from Three Provinces</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Since the Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi retreated to Xinfeng, the military leaders of northern Guangdong have concentrated in Nanxiong. Chen Jitang specially dispatched Li Yangjing, the Commander of the Third Army, to Xiong some time ago to discuss future plans for pursuing and suppressing the Communist bandits and coordinating with friendly forces with the military leaders. After the meeting in Xiong, Li returned to the provincial capital to report to Chen Jitang. Chen Jitang then convened a military conference at headquarters at 9 AM on the 23rd to discuss the strategy for pursuing and suppressing the Communist bandits. Li Yangjing reported on the discussions with the military leaders in Shaozhou and Nanxiong. Subsequently, the senior military officers made detailed discussions and resolved many military plans, which were telegraphed to the front-line generals for implementation that day. Regarding the recent military situation at the front, although there are no bandit traces in the Nanxiong area, it is rumored that local communists infiltrated Qiannan from Xiaojiangkou, Longnan, on the 21st of the month, with a force of about 10,000 people, dividing to harass Longxianxu and Nanpu, which are part of Wengyuan County, on the Guangdong border. Longxianxu is located ninety-five li west of Wengyuan County seat, while Nanpu is located more than one hundred li east of the county seat. If these places are alarmed, the defenses of Lianping and Heping in East Jiang and Wengyuan and Yingde in North Jiang will simultaneously be strained. Therefore, after discovering the alarming news from Longxian on the morning of the 21st, Hao, the magistrate of Wengyuan County, immediately sent a special envoy to Wangfu Gang and telegraphed the Northwest District Pacification Headquarters in Shaoguan to request assistance. Upon receiving the report, Li Han魂 first dispatched Gui Army Commander Wang Zanbin's division to Yingde to await orders, and also ordered Li Gang, the Deputy Commander of the Third Independent Division, to lead the third regiment of the division, commanded by Qiu Guisheng, to return from Nanxiong to Hetou, Yingde, and then proceed to Wangfu Gang and Wengyuan to suppress and intercept the bandits as opportunities arise. At the same time, the First Army Group Headquarters telegraphed Li Zhenliang's regiment of the Second Army's Fifth Division and Huang Zhiwen's detachment of the Third Army's Eighth Division, which were stationed in Laolong, to intensify their vigilance in Lianping and Heping to prevent the Communist bandits from Longxian from infiltrating east. As for the Third Army's Seventh Division, it took over the defense of Meixian, while Huang Renhuan's detachment of the Second Independent Division returned to Pingyuan and Jiaoling to guard the area around Xunwu and Baichi. This is the current situation of the Guangdong army's defense of the Northeast Jiang area. As for Southern Jiangxi, from Nan'an downwards, the Guangdong army is still maintaining a strong defense. From Meiling upwards, Dayu to Nankang and Ganzhou, Yu Hanmou's troops and the Central Army are continuously increasing troops and deploying defenses. Recently, two more divisions of the Xiang Army, commanded by Wang Dongyuan and Chen Guangzhong, have arrived, making the defense even more solid. After entering western Jiangxi, Wang and Chen's divisions advanced towards Shangyou, defeating Li Mingrui's Communist bandit force in Shangyou. They then advanced to Yingqian to search and suppress bandits. They have now established contact with Yu Hanmou's troops and Chen Cheng's troops. Recently, Chairman Chiang has ordered Liu Jianxu, the commander of the Xiang Army, to assemble the majority of his troops and advance rapidly from Yingqian to Nankang and Dayu. All of Yu Hanmou's two divisions (Li and Ye), Chen Cheng's two divisions (Zhou and Li), Liu Jianxu's two divisions (Wang and Chen), and Ma Kun's brigade in Southern Jiangxi are under the command and deployment of Army Commander Yu Hanmou to unify orders.

<h3>The Economic Crisis in Rural Anhui</h3>
<p>Abundant Harvest of Rice, Surplus Grain, Market Prices Plummet</p>
<p>Wuhu dispatch: Among China's agricultural products, Anhui ranks as an important rice producer. In prosperous years, the rice from various counties in southern Anhui would gather at Wuhu Port, and exports would reach over 9 million shi. Although there was a major flood last year, there was still a surplus of about 3 million shi of rice that was successively exported. This year, due to the timely rainfall and the recovery of the rice paddies from last year's disaster, the soil is even more fertile, and the grain yield is twice as high as in previous years. Before the new rice has even appeared on the market, rice prices have already plummeted. In the span of a month, the price has dropped from 11 yuan per dan to about 6.5 yuan. Underproduction leading to insufficient consumption is a cause for poverty, but overproduction exceeding consumption is even more dangerous. After the disaster, farmers pawned possessions and took out loans to maintain their livelihoods and barely continue farming. All their hopes are pinned on the autumn harvest. Based on the predicted grain prices, the price of new rice may not exceed 2.5 yuan per shi, and the rice price will only be about 5 yuan. Farmers who borrowed one shi of rice last year must now repay four shi of rice. There is a hidden worry of bankruptcy in rural areas. In recent days, the rice ears, due to their weight, have been hanging down to the ground. Farmers are deeply afraid of the rice germinating due to flooding, and are already rushing to harvest day and night. (July 26th)</p>
<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Meat Ticket Escapes by Seizing Opportunity: Sun Jinsheng and his son, who run a tofu shop in Chengbeixiang, Fifteenth District, were kidnapped by bandits on the morning of the 17th of this month at 3 AM. After the village chief reported the incident to the District Office, the District Office and the Public Security Bureau requested the county government to find a way to rescue them. The next day, Sun Jinsheng's son was sent by the bandits to Xitangqian and instructed to prepare 3,000 yuan quickly and go to Da'anjiang in Jiangbei to redeem his father. The family was extremely anxious because they did not have this huge sum of money. Unexpectedly, Jinsheng suddenly returned home safely the day before yesterday (the 26th). According to his own account, after being kidnapped, he was taken by boat to Da'anjiang and was repeatedly beaten severely, suffering greatly. Fortunately, the bandit leader suddenly suffered a severe attack of cholera the night before, and the remaining bandits tried their best to rescue him. By dawn, all the bandits were extremely tired and sound asleep, so he seized the opportunity to sneak ashore and escape to Niuhongdichu, where he took a boat to Shanghai and returned home by a roundabout route.</p>
<p>Watermelon Boat Robbed Midway: At midnight on the 27th, a watermelon boat, loaded with watermelons from Xihugangkou, was heading to the city to sell them. When passing the Hqiao outside the West Gate, it suddenly encountered a bandit boat coming head-on. As it approached the watermelon boat, more than a dozen strong men, wielding knives and sticks, swarmed onto the boat, tied up the two crew members and beat them violently, forcing them to reveal where they had hidden the money. After searching repeatedly, they found nothing and transported all the watermelons and clothes on board to their own boat and sped away.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Village Woman Beaten to Death and Body Abandoned in River: Gu Afu, a villager in Nanqianxiang, Eleventh District (Nanyan City), which is under the jurisdiction of the county, has been guarding the Zhou family's ancestral hall and farming for a living. His wife, Wang, 26 years old, was returning to Ning on the morning of the 20th of this month. While passing through the Susheqiao area, she rested in the shade of a tree because of the hot weather. She happened to see a melon field nearby with fragrant melons, so she picked two and ate them. Unexpectedly, Wang Zhugenquan (nicknamed "Pockmarked Genquan") of the melon field saw her. Without asking for an explanation, he beat Wang severely with a carrying pole. She soon died of her injuries. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, Genquan threw the body into the river at that place in an attempt to destroy the evidence. Afterwards, Zhang Sannan, the head of the 396th Tu, reported to Afu, the deceased's husband, that his wife had accidentally fallen into the river and drowned while washing peaches at the Susheqiao riverside. Upon hearing this, Afu rushed to the scene, retrieved the body, and hurriedly put it in a coffin. At the same time, he reported to the District Office of the district, who forwarded it to the county government, requesting justice. However, the murderer, Zhu Genquan, had already heard the news and fled, and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>Boatman Becomes Rich Overnight and Searched by Police: The area under Yingxiu Bridge inside the West Gate of this county is where Jiangbei Peng households gather, and they usually make a living by collecting garbage and working as small vendors. The other day, a young fellow villager from Jiangbei, wearing fancy clothes, suddenly arrived at the home of boatman Liu Erlang, carrying more than 2,000 yuan in banknotes. He claimed to be a manager at a certain foreign company in Shanghai and bought a Xiangyusha shirt as a gift for Liu's daughter. The boatman wearing fancy clothes aroused suspicion, and someone secretly reported it to the Public Security First Branch, which sent police to search the boat. More than 300 yuan in banknotes and a pawn ticket were found in the rice bucket. When asked about it, Liu Erlang claimed that the young man was his nephew, who was doing business in Shanghai and had now returned to Shanghai. Director Gao of the branch obtained the confession and ordered Liu Erlang to post bail and have his nephew go to the branch to claim it within ten days, otherwise the banknotes would be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Disbanding of Wounded and Sick Soldiers: The Wuyi Temporary Clearance Committee for Wounded and Sick Soldiers, following the orders of the Military Commission, has been sorting out the wounded and sick soldiers who have recovered from various hospitals in recent days, assigning them to return to their units or disbanding them, and ordering them to leave the country within a certain time limit. Those who have not recovered will still be treated by the respective hospitals, and they are strictly prohibited from going out to avoid causing trouble.

<p>Sudden Downpour After Long Drought: This year's summer has been extremely dry. Not only has the tiger epidemic been rampant in the Jiangbei area, but the rice in the mountain fields and dams has also been severely wilted. There were worries that there would be no hope for the autumn harvest and that disasters would occur frequently. However, yesterday (the 26th) at two o'clock in the afternoon, the sky suddenly became gloomy and dark, and a heavy rain poured down. Although the time was too short, such a timely rain could save the long-parched fields and alleviate all epidemics.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Zhangjia Village Repeatedly Robbed Four Families: More than ten bandits armed with guns suddenly arrived at Zhangjia Village, District 5 under the county, the night before last.

<p>Hurricane Destroys Houses and Injures People: In this county today (26th), around 3:00 PM, dark clouds suddenly gathered, accompanied by thunder and heavy rain, followed by a hurricane. Although it lasted only a short time, the losses were quite extensive. The investigation is as follows: In the backyard of Wu Xiaojia, a merchant in the Huaidequan Alley in the central market of the city, there was a locust tree that was over a hundred years old. When the wind rose, it snapped the tree in half and destroyed one of Wu Xiaojia's thatched houses, and also destroyed two bedrooms and two guest rooms in the house of pharmacist Tao Yunqing. At that time, Tao Yunqing happened to be sleeping in the room and was injured in the head by bricks and tiles. Fortunately, the injuries were not serious and there was no major problem. However, the appliances and displays in the bedrooms and guest rooms were severely damaged, and the loss is said to be quite large. In addition, the ancient Sanyuan Hall temple on Gaogong Bridge in the city, which was built during the Ming Dynasty, had its roof ridge destroyed by the hurricane. Furthermore, numerous thatched houses outside the North Gate and on the Yun Causeway, as well as awnings in the streets, were destroyed by the hurricane.</p>

Under the guise of inspection, they robbed the boat of all its money and silver. Furthermore, at the home of Xu Anbo, a resident near Dongdun Town in the county, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived the night before last, each armed with guns. They broke down the door and entered, robbing for several hours before leaving at dawn, with a loss of three to four hundred yuan.</p>

<p>Melon Vendor Falls into River and Drowns: Zhang Fuchang, a farmer from the north and south sand area of ​​Sigu Bridge, along with three companions, loaded watermelons to sell in Songjiang. After selling them, they were towed back to Ping by the Hongni Ban steamship with an empty boat. At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, when they arrived at Lugong Bridge outside the East Gate of this city, because the bridge opening was narrow and too many boats were being towed, the boat hit the bridge pier with a loud crash. Zhang was shocked and fell into the river. The wheel knew it had caused the disaster and tried harder to rescue him, but it was too late.</p>

<h3>President Li Zheng of Beijing Normal University Comes to Beijing</h3>
<p>Requests Flexibility Regarding Suspension of Enrollment</p>
<p>Meets to Discuss the Direction of Reorganizing Normal University</p>
<p>The previous student unrest at Beijing Normal University was due to factional divisions among the students. They nominated three candidates for president and requested the government to appoint one. In fact, none of the three nominated could come, and the government was unlikely to approve the request. This was because a small number of students were taking advantage of the lack of a president to act freely, while the majority of students were dissatisfied with the selfishness of the minority and had blockaded the student union. As a result, the students were at odds with each other, and the school was unstable. After Li Zheng arrived at the school, he explained and persuaded them in various ways, unsealing the student union so that students could operate within the proper framework. If anything went beyond the scope, the administrative authorities would stop and punish it. The small number of students who first started the trouble have been safely taken care of due to the general trend. Now the school is calm, and the deans of each college and the heads of each department have been appointed (referring to the existing professors). Preparations are being made to start enrollment, but since the Ministry of Education ordered the suspension of enrollment, the school has felt difficult. President Li arrived in Beijing on the 28th to negotiate with the Ministry of Education, requesting flexibility regarding the suspension of enrollment at Beijing Normal University. Minister Zhu believed that this matter was related to the government's entire reorganization plan and did not give a definite answer. President Li met with Minister Zhu to discuss the direction of reorganizing Beijing Normal University's education. It is said that he will stay in Beijing for several days, waiting for the matter to be completed before returning to Ping.</p>

<h3>The Tenth World Olympic Games Inaugurated Today Due to Van's Defeat</h3>
<p>Held in Los Angeles, USA, with Participants from Over Fifty Countries</p>
<p>Fifteen Types of Sports, China Sends Liu Changchun for the First Time</p>
<p>The long-awaited Tenth World Olympic Games were inaugurated in Los Angeles, California, USA, at 1:00 PM today. This time, participants include more than fifty countries of all sizes, with over two thousand athletes, fifteen types of sports, and more than one hundred and fifty events. Our country also sent athlete Liu Changchun and coach Song Junfu to participate. The National Sports Advancement Association also sent Secretary-General Shen Siliang to attend the opening ceremony. It is expected that the national emblems of various countries will flutter in the gentle breeze of the Pacific Ocean in the arena of world peace and war, to promote the great alliance of world nations.</p>
<p>Coubertin's Statement on the Restoration of the World Olympic Games French Baron Coubertin, who restored the World Olympic Games, made the following statement regarding this Games:</p>
<p>The true essence of the struggle for survival lies not in temporary victory, but in eternal struggle, and it is especially important that it be carried out in a proper manner. If this principle is passed on, humanity will be able to incorporate health, and the world will be able to achieve a city of well-being. The Olympic Games are to show the world the true meaning of survival, and also to use this true meaning to guide and achieve the great purpose of the Olympics. I hope that the spirit of harmony and sympathy can be fully expressed, so that the light of the Olympics can shine on the future, the friendship between nations can grow with each year, and the gospel of humanity can become more and more sincere and pure.</p>
<p>The Gate of the Olympic Arena</p>
<p>Prizes The prizes for the World Olympic Games are divided into medals and certificates. The top three in each individual and team sport receive awards: (A) Individual Competition, (1) First Place: Gold Medal and Certificate, (2) Second Place: Silver Medal and Certificate, (3) Third Place: Bronze Medal and Certificate. (B) Team Competition, (1) First Place: Team Certificate, Team Members Receive Gold Medals and Certificates, (2) Second Place: Team Certificate, Team Members Receive Silver Medals and Certificates, (3) Third Place: Team Certificate, Team Members Receive Bronze Medals and Certificates. Team members can only receive awards if they participated in the competition. The names of the athletes are engraved on the venue of the Games. All participating athletes and staff receive a commemorative medal. Athletes with special skills or who create new records in the preliminary rounds but do not win awards will be recommended by the International Committee to the Organizing Committee to issue special certificates to show encouragement.</p>
<p>Trophy The World Olympic Games does not have a system of total trophies. The names of the top six winners in each sport are inscribed on the certificate of honor in alphabetical order. The certificate is kept by the International Olympic Committee. When people say that a certain country won the World Olympic Games trophy, it refers to the track and field trophy, because track and field is the main part of the Games.</p>
<p>The Olympic Flag The Olympic flag has a white background with red, yellow, blue, white, and black circles embroidered on it, interlocked with each other to represent the great gathering of the five races of the five continents of the world, and to promote the feeling of mutual friendship. This flag was donated by Belgium in 1920. From the opening day of the Games, it is hung together with the national flags of all participating countries around the sports arena. A flagpole is erected in the arena, dedicated to raising the Olympic flag. This flag is usually kept by the city hall of the host country's meeting place. It is taken out and handed over to the host country of the next Games at the next Games.</p>
<p>Mark of Victory When the final of each sport ends, the national flag of the winning country must be raised, and at the same time the military band will play the national anthem of the winning country. All athletes and spectators in the arena must pay the highest respect in the same arena.</p>
<p>Tennis and Football The World Olympic Games does not have tennis competitions because there is an international tennis tournament, the Davis Cup, and an international individual tennis tournament, Wimbledon, every year. As for football, it was originally included, and the football competition of the Ninth World Games was particularly prosperous, so our country initially planned to send a football team to participate, but it was decided to cancel it due to rule issues. If the World Football Association is willing to slightly modify the rules to meet the needs of amateur sports, it can also be included. However, when the World Football Association met in Budapest, Hungary, the meeting decided not to change its attitude, so this Games ultimately failed to be included.</p>
<p>Next Games to be Held in Germany Los Angeles, 28th - The Olympic Committee met here today and decided that the next Games (1936) will be held in Germany. The location of the Twelfth Games in 1940 has not yet been decided. Japan and twelve countries have proposed holding the Games in their own country.</p>
<p>Nurmi Prohibited from Participating (Los Angeles, 28th) Finnish long-distance runner Nurmi has had problems with his eligibility as an amateur athlete due to receiving financial instruction. The International Amateur Athletic Federation reviewed the matter today and did not recognize Nurmi as an amateur athlete, and officially announced that he was prohibited from attending. Nurmi holds the world record for 5,000 meters at 14 minutes and 28.2 seconds, and 10,000 meters at 30 minutes and 6.2 seconds. He was planning to participate in the marathon at this Olympics, but was not allowed to attend, which is a pity for running fans. (Editor's Note) Nurmi has participated in the World Games four times, but has never participated in the marathon. Nurmi had previously declared that he would participate in the marathon at this year's Tenth Games to end his lifelong athletic career. This kind of behavior is very popular. Now, unexpectedly, he is not allowed to participate because of violating amateur rules, which is the biggest regret in Nurmi's athletic career.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>The Final Session Increased by Slightly More Than Two Taels Yesterday, gold prices tended to rise again, but the market conditions were unpredictable and erratic, hovering around 750 taels all day, with a difference of only two or three taels. The final tally showed an increase of two taels, but industry sentiment remained hesitant. In the morning, although silver bars rose, and American silver did not change, it was actually due to frequent drops in exchange rates, so it opened high. After that, the ups and downs varied slightly by one or two taels. As for bills of exchange, British and American currencies were stable, with banks alternately buying and selling, making the market even more scattered, and prices fluctuating around 51 taels, as if the bulls and bears were evenly matched. Almost all of the August contracts that had not been cleared were settled, due to the bulls adding five cents. The daily situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The Morning Opened with an Increase of Three Taels and One Cent Starting from 751 taels and three cents for September, an increase of three taels and one cent, because American silver was as before, but large bars returned by one-sixteenth to one-eighth, without being affected. Especially since British and American exchange rates repeatedly plummeted by more than two and seventy-five hundredths, and because Zhifeng, Yonghong, Kangyong, and others bought in, it increased to 51 taels and eight cents. However, there were also quite a few sell orders, and the price fell slightly by one tael to 50 taels and six cents. Because Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongtongchun, Yifengyong, and goods companies rushed to buy, and American silver companies bought 4375 worth of British gold for October, and the industry also bought 6875 worth of American gold for August, and China Bank absorbed 4375 worth of British gold for November, the price rose to 52 taels and three cents. Unexpectedly, HSBC and others released 875 worth of American gold for September, and Daxing, Yongyuanheng, and Hengxing took the opportunity to sell, causing it to fall back to 50 taels. At 9:30, HSBC quoted British gold higher by one and two-fifths of a penny, and American gold unchanged, to offset the small exchange rate difference. At this time, Tongchun bought in again at 50 taels and seven cents. Afterwards, the situation was chaotic, fluctuating around 50 taels, with different numbers of purchases and sales by each firm, but there were no large batches. It is estimated that Hengxing, Fuxing, Yongdaxingyong, and Zhifengyong successively sold, and because 6875 worth of American gold for this month could be settled, and British gold for October even required half a penny, the price fell by two taels, and at 10:10 it was 48 taels and six cents. After this, there seemed to be an upward trend, but people's hearts were uncertain and buying and selling were still very different. However, the price broke through the 50 tael mark because the bank absorbed 1875 worth of American gold for November, and HSBC absorbed half a penny of British gold, until after 11:30, Yuanxingyong, Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, Futaiheng, and Yuantai all purchased. At noon, it was 50 taels and seven cents, and then closed at 50 taels and six cents. In the afternoon, speculation was weak. The market opened at 50 taels and four cents, with Hengyu and Yuanxingyong buying, and rising to 51 taels and three cents. Huabi absorbed 75 worth of American gold for August, and Wheat absorbed 0625 for October. Then, due to the goods companies selling to cover their positions, it lost one tael to 50 taels. After 3:00, Bombay bought 18 and a half worth of British gold for October, and Hengyu and others bought in, adding one tael. At 3:30, it was 51 taels and one cent. Ultimately, due to the activity of sellers, and American gold seemed to be loosening, the brokers bought 75 to 8125 for August. Zhifengyong and Tongchun both sold. As the market approached closing, it was 50 taels and two cents. At 4:00, the closing price was 50 taels and five cents, higher than the previous evening by two taels and three cents, then suppressed to 50 taels. The maximum for the day was 52 taels and three cents, and the minimum was 48 taels and six cents, a difference of three taels and seven cents. The red bar increased by nine taels.</p>
<p>The Official Price Was Suppressed by Sixty-Seven Taels The official price was still 817 taels, suppressed by 66-67 taels, and 67 taels in the afternoon, two taels less than the previous day. Registered prices were 54 taels to 50 taels. Water replenishment was calculated at 50 taels for the whole day.</p>
<p>Buyers Seemed to Occupy the Majority In on-the-table transactions, buyers seemed to be more numerous. Yuanxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Zhaofengchang, Hongkangyong, Tongchun, Hengxingyuan, Tongtaichang, and Yifengyong all bought in. Yuanheng, Daxingyong, Hengxing, and Yuankangxiang all sold out. In the afternoon, Hengyu and Yuanxingyong both bought in. Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Yuantai, Tongchun, and goods companies all sold out. The rest were mixed, but there were no large transactions. On that day, the Dalian gang only had two or three hundred bars. The Cantonese gang, like Hengxing, sold more than three hundred bars, and there were few buyers. A speculator named Wu sold slightly in the morning market, but bought to cover positions.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: British Currency Loosened, American Currency Stable</h3>
<p>Gold Firms First Bought, Then Sold</p>
<p>Yesterday, silver prices rose in British currency and were stable in American currency, and exchange rates had plummeted for three consecutive days (a total of more than four and eighty-seven hundredths), so the trend of British currency loosening and American currency stabilizing in this port emerged.

The internal market loosened in the morning, then remained flat, and the gold market rebounded, returning to the 750 tael mark, due to the successive declines in exchange rates. As a result, compared to the previous day, British gold increased by one and two-fifths of a penny, and American gold decreased by six-hundredths and twenty-five thousandths of a penny. Transactions at various banks were quite active, with approximately 100,000 pounds of British gold. Gold firms slightly sold, and various banks made deals without being quiet. Silver firms and Bombay all bought in October contracts. Approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan of American gold were also traded, with various firms first buying and then selling slightly in the afternoon. Shoufengyong, Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, and Yuanxingyong all covered their positions. Wheat Bank traded American-British exchange rates for October, buying American gold at 30 yuan and six-hundredths and twenty-five thousandths, and selling British gold at 18 and a half, a difference of three yuan, five jiao, and one-ninth of a cent. The transaction records for each exchange rate are recorded below.</p>

The selling price in the early market was one shilling and eight and thirty-one hundred twenty-five thousandths to four hundred and thirty-seven thousandths of a penny, and the buying price was three-hundredths and seventy-five thousandths to half a penny.

<h3>Smooth Delivery of Securities in July Contracts</h3>

<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>(American East Silver Company Report)</p>
<p>On Thursday, the New York stock market had very active trading throughout the day, with 2.7 million shares traded. The market continued to rise uniformly, but the gains were not as large as the previous day. Many winners in the later market took the opportunity to sell. That morning, retail buyers were very enthusiastic, and prices were also the highest. Near noon, the market showed some fatigue. Later, because wheat prices continued to rise, the later market rebounded strongly. Selling began in the last one or two hours, but most of the market was able to stabilize. On this day, Bethlehem Steel Company held a board meeting to decide on the issue of dividend payments, but people's hearts did not seem to be nervous, and the stock price did not move throughout the day. Later, the board of directors decided to suspend the payment of preferred stock dividends. The current stock market situation is very optimistic. Although winners selling out during the day is still inevitable, judging from the sentiment of the market, it is already quite resilient. The Dow Jones Index is attached below.</p>

<h3>Spot Yarn and Cotton on the Yarn and Cotton Delivery Date</h3>
<p>600 bales of spot yarn were traded, and the cotton yarn market remained calm, but spot yarn roots were still tight, and all factories were hard-minded. However, after the actual demand had been sold in large quantities, it has now stopped. However, retail transactions with various Nambu gangs are still ongoing. Other gangs have less activity. According to buyer sentiment, it is very strong, because spot goods are out of stock in the market, and the future will still be based on spot yarn. The futures yarn month-end delivery market is closed. Customer gangs bought a total of 600 bales of spot yarn, and the market fell by two and a half cents. The gangs that sold are listed below.</p>
<p>Guangdong 135 Mainland 60 Sichuan 50 Total 600 bales</p>
<p>Shantou 205 Shachang 20 Fellow Traders 120</p>
<p>Spot cotton factories are still healthy, and the cotton market is still stable. Although gold prices are small, and American cotton is firm, the sentiment is good. In addition, the bottom goods of this cotton are scarce, and all factories have a need for futures cotton with month-end delivery market closed. The spot cotton sales are listed below.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 33.35 Shenxin Bought 200 Pieces Spot Goods Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 31.50 Hengfeng Bought 500 Bales Again</p>
<h3>General Situation of Cotton Crops in Tianjin</h3>
<p>In Tianjin, the rainfall in the spring was insufficient, and the sowing was later. After sowing, some were damaged by hail. Generally speaking, it is still smooth, and all places can expect a normal harvest. The cotton fields in the (Xihe) area have decreased by 10% compared to last year. Insufficient rainfall caused poor development after sowing, so American cotton was replanted. The cotton fields in that area have decreased by about 20%. The development in the Daqing River basin is very good. In the (Yuhe) area, the planting area of coarse velvet cotton is the same as in normal years, while American cotton has decreased by 10%. The climate was favorable after sowing, and the development was good. In the (Shanji) area, the cotton fields have increased by 15% compared to last year. The weather was dry during planting, but it was smooth afterwards, and the cotton trees developed well. The harvest is expected to be no different from last year.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the July Yarn Settlement</h3>
<p>And a Retrospective of the Entire Process</p>
<p>The July yarn futures contract began trading on May 2nd, with prices around 154.5 taels. It rose by over 6 taels initially, but then due to the bankruptcy of rural areas in China, economic decline, and new lows in American cotton prices, raw cotton prices plummeted, causing a lack of confidence. Actual sales stagnated, and coupled with aggressive and cheap Japanese yarn sales, some yarn factories sold off several thousand bales. The market became increasingly weak, with prices dropping directly from 55 taels to 38.3 taels. At this point, people's anxiety reached its peak, and many expected to see exceptionally low prices. Midway through, American cotton prices rebounded, and demand from southern ports greatly increased. Yunnan merchants, benefiting from abundant agricultural harvests, heavily purchased 10-count coarse yarn. Merchants from Guangdong and Yunnan rushed to buy, searching without end, and factories were overwhelmed. The remaining spot goods were almost completely swept away. At the same time, Hunan also showed signs of improvement. Buyers, seeing the shortage of spot yarn, shifted to purchasing August, September, and October futures, and sentiment reached a boiling point. Rongxing and Changfeng, two major yarn firms, heavily went long, absorbing an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 bales, and prices rose from over 38 taels to 54.2 taels (the highest). The price range during these two months was as high as 15.9 taels, which can be considered significant. This situation was entirely driven by actual demand. The settlement price was over 153 taels, with a remaining quantity of only 3,700 bales. Among these, 2,950 bales were self-settled, 750 bales were delivered by Gengfeng, and 450 bales were received by Rongxing. The brokers and quantities for both buyers and sellers are listed below:</p>

<p>Cotton: The July cotton futures contract started trading in early May at a price between 31.8 and 31.9 taels, rising by over 3 taels. Shortly after, due to stagnation in actual demand and a drop in yarn prices, factories had no need to purchase. Furthermore, the American Cotton Bureau announced that it would sell off half of its 1.3 million bales of American cotton. Coupled with favorable weather conditions for new cotton, progress was smooth, and prices fell from over 6 cents to 5 cents. In July, prices broke through the 5-cent mark, setting a new record unseen in a century. People around the world showed great panic. As a result, cotton futures experienced sharp selling pressure, and longs were unable to sustain their positions, leading to a gradual and rapid decline in prices. Moreover, the China Cotton Corporation, having purchased spot cotton in various producing areas, and seeing that factories had no intention to buy, had no choice but to sell futures contracts to manage risk. Recently, the market has continued to decline, and the Ningbo Yao Hua Exchange has also been affected by global trends. There was a lack of buyers, with only sellers present. With both sides deadlocked, it was difficult for the market to open. The exchange authorities tried to maintain the market by purchasing cotton and selling futures in Shanghai, further weakening the cotton futures market. The lowest price reached 27 taels. Subsequently, gold prices rebounded, and American cotton, due to excessive rainfall and severe insect infestations, rebounded from 5 cents to 6.2 cents, showing a sharp recovery. The highest price reached 31.95 taels, and large accounts bought to go long. The settlement price at the end of the month was over 31 taels, with a remaining quantity of only 18,700 dan. Among these, 15,000 to 16,000 dan were settled by fellow traders, and actual deliveries were only a little over 1,000 dan. The goods consisted of Shandong cotton, Zhengzhou cotton, and Shaanxi cotton. Yong'an Factory received the most, and China Cotton Trading Company delivered the most. Other deliveries were minimal. The brokers and quantities for both buyers and sellers are listed below:</p>

<h3>American Cotton in an Unsettled State</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to short covering and excessive rainfall, but then weakened due to some longs liquidating positions. The near-term contracts rose by 1 to 2 points, while the far-term contracts fell by 1 to 2 points. Spot prices remained unchanged. English cotton futures rose by 14 to 15 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton strengthened due to the weak British pound. Pingguoer rose by 2.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 3 rupees. (Reported by telegram on the 28th)</p>

<h3>New Early Rice Continues to Arrive, 18 Stones</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the southern market, 18 stones of new early rice from Puxin arrived again. Over a dozen lots of old rice also arrived. The situation rose and then weakened, affecting buyers as well. Merchants from Suzhou and Tongxiang slightly lowered prices. Merchants from villages bought 300 stones of thin early rice. The opening was settled. Demand for Changshu and Xixi northern rice and Duyang pointy rice was limited, and the situation was downstream. New early rice only had sporadic sales, with prices similar to the previous session.</p>
<p>Yesterday, ten-odd ships arrived at Xinzha. The spot market for Zhongguan white rice showed no improvement. Shops were focused on new arrivals, and old goods were neglected. Qingjiao Fenglian early and late rice were ignored, with prices strong at 2 jiao. Arrivals of foreign Dujiang pointy rice were weak, and buyers continued to purchase, pushing prices up nearly a jiao. Glutinous rice saw neither boom nor bust.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Merchants Continue to Purchase Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was slightly more active. Tianjin merchants continued to purchase Saigon rice, while merchants from Jiangbei, Zhenjiang, Chongming, and other inland regions inquired about small milled rice. As a result, sentiment improved and the market slightly firmed up. However, the total market transaction volume was still only 5,000 bags, and owners, seeing the improvement in market prices, were generally looking to sell, so prices did not rise significantly. Saigon No. 1 sub-rice opened at 1,500 bags, priced at 10 yuan, 2 jiao, and 2 fen to 10 yuan, 1 jiao. Small milled rice opened at over 3,000 bags, priced at 9 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen, 9 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 fen to 9 yuan. Tianjin merchants bought 500 bags of Saigon rice, and various merchants bought 2,000 bags of small milled rice. The rest was taken in by local merchants. Currently, the buying appetite of various merchants is active, and if transactions continue, the market price may potentially improve.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Rallies Sharply After the Second Session</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for all months initially showed stability before rising. Prices for foreign wheat quoted in Chicago were good, up 2 to 3 jiao, and Canadian wheat was up about 4 fen. In addition, buyers initially remained inactive, and there were no surprises in opening prices. However, after the second session, due to purchases from Tianjin cigarette and other merchants for both near-term and far-term deliveries, sentiment rebounded, and prices rose steadily. Many speculators also took advantage of this opportunity to aggressively buy in each session, so the price increase was quite sharp. Observing the later situation, it is said that foreign wheat markets are estimated to decline, so whether or not they will come to China later is a matter of great concern. As a result, the current month rose by 2 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day, August rose by 1 fen and 7 li, September rose by 2 fen, October rose by 1 fen and 2.5 li, November rose by 1 fen and 5 li, and December rose by 1 fen and 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Some Longs Return 期 Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, although foreign wheat rose by 2 to 3 jiao and Canadian wheat rose by 4 fen, general sentiment was that wheat had risen sharply the previous day, while flour prices had not risen by much, so some longs gradually sold off, causing the market to slightly weaken. However, inland customers showed greater stability in their thinking. It is difficult to expect a strong surge in selling. If foreign wheat is not cost-effective, then the standard market value cannot be considered high, so returning to a good path is not surprising. As a result, August was down 1 fen compared to the previous day, September was down 3 fen, October was down 2 fen, and November and December were down 2 fen. The spot wheat market has become chaotic due to differences in quality and origin. Opening prices vary greatly. For example, Guzhen high-quality wheat, due to its scarcity, opened at 3 taels and 4 qian, which is similar to the standard price. The remaining Zhenjiang wheat opened at 3 taels, 1 qian, and 7 fen, Shuangfeng wheat opened at 3 taels, 1 qian, and 5 fen, Taicang wheat opened at 3 taels and 5 fen, and Pudong wheat opened at 2 taels and 8 qian and 8 fen. A total of over 1,400 bags were purchased by Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse and White Sugar Trends More Upward</h3>
<p>Raw Sand Red Rises One Qian</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Sugar Association market, the No. 24 Dutch sugar white group had very good sentiment, with prices quoted at 14 taels and 7 qian. However, most buyers remained on the sidelines and offered lower prices, resulting in very few transactions. Later, 14 taels and 6 qian saw 200 bags transacted. The momentum seemed exhausted, and the trend was particularly firm. No. 14 raw sand red rose to 12 taels and 4 qian, and transactions were still active. Taikoo Sugar B mark rose to 16 taels and 3 qian, CW mark rose to 15 taels and 8 qian and a half, and the market reported it was sold out. DY mark was 15 taels and 4 qian and a half, HX mark was 15 taels and 3 qian and a half, HM mark was 14 taels and 9 qian. Although transactions were scattered, the market shape was very firm.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods: New Jinshan Twigs Loosen</h3>
<p>Orchid Bamboo Twigs Slightly Fall</p>
<p>New goods of Jinshan twigs have recently seen a surge in supply, and prices have loosened. The top-grade original branches, which had risen to 30 taels after customs clearance, have now fallen to around 26 taels. Ordinary village goods are around 23 taels, and flat branches have fallen by 7 to 8 taels. Glutinous rice branches, due to self-management among various trades and lower input costs, have adjusted to market conditions and loosened by over 10 taels. Therefore, buyers, seeing prices loosening, have become more cautious in their purchases. If prices can be stabilized soon, then the selling price will also stabilize.</p>
<p>Only ten boxes of new orchid bamboo twigs arrived initially, so the first opening was 27 taels and 6 qian. The second batch also did not exceed a hundred boxes. Yesterday, the released goods fluctuated slightly. Top-grade opened at 27 taels, with subsequent grades decreasing accordingly, down several qian to one tael compared to the previous session. Black leaf twigs were still in their first opening yesterday, with prices not exceeding 18 taels. Early red twigs were scarce, with little fluctuation.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shandong Hand-spun Arrives in Shanghai, Not Weak</h3>
<p>New Sales Channels Discovered in London… Monthly Transactions of 600 Dan. Shandong's best and second-grade hand-spun silk (i.e., yellow silk heads) are selling well in France. This year, due to the impact of cheap Japanese silk waste, sales of Shandong hand-spun have become sluggish. Recently, fortunately, new sales channels have been discovered in England. Xiangmao and others have monthly transactions of 600 bales, so Shanghai's inventory is gradually thinning. Yesterday, the Yanjing class Tongzhou ship transported 780 dan of best and second-grade hand-spun to Shanghai, stored in Hengxing Gong and other silk warehouses.</p>
<h3>White Factory Warp Transports 30 Bundles to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Silk weaving merchants in Hangzhou who bought spot White Factory warp in Shanghai are now delivering and shipping in batches as the end of the month approaches. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Hangzhou train also transported 30 bundles of SF and other brands of 20-22 warp to Hangzhou, in preparation for weaving various silks.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign Silk Sales Completely Stalled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market was completely stalled for domestic and foreign sales due to the overseas summer holidays, with no silk telegrams being transmitted, and European firms waiting and watching. Domestic silk weaving factories, anticipating weak autumn sales and facing tight finances, have mostly reduced production or stopped machines. The demand for raw silk is nil, and purchases are extremely weak.</p>
<h3>Needle-like Eyebrow Green Tea Sells Well, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, demand for needle-like eyebrow green tea from both the road and local markets was strong among British and French firms. Chinese tea merchants, with limited inventory on hand, became increasingly firm. As a result, the market price rose sharply by 3 to 4 taels compared to the previous session. The large help green tea from Wuyuan has been almost completely bought up by Jardine Matheson and Jinlong in the past two days, but the selling price of 52 to 53 taels is 10 taels lower than last year. There were sporadic transactions of high-grade eyebrow green tea from Tunxi, Shexian, Suian local market, and other areas, and prices remained firm. However, the wax light goods from the northwest region of Wuyuan have not yet reached their development time. Market for tribute Xi green tea and Qining black tea were also desolate.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Domestic Camel Wool Has Current Transactions</h3>
<p>The market for woolen fabrics has been cautious lately due to the shortening of foreign lengths and the government's reform of changing taels to yuan. Buyers have been cautious and reduced purchases of various goods. Currently, only domestic camel wool has actual transactions. Brands such as Weilun, Tianxiang, Weiyi, Xinda, Shengda, Hongfa, Maoye, Tongyi, Dachang, Huadong, Danan, Dada, Da China and others are generally offered at 2 taels, 1 qian, and 5 fen, plain colors at 1 tael and 8 qian, Dade, Dadong, and Tianyi at 1 tael and 9 qian, and Zhanghua sheep pattern wide and narrow stripes at 1 tael and 6 qian.</p>
<h3>New Hardware: French Wire Nails Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>The French wire nail market has been greatly impacted since the active sales of locally produced nails. Standards have gradually declined. The latest price is estimated at only 7 taels and 5 qian per barrel, down 5 qian from before. However, on the buyer side, domestic nails can also be exported, so they are unwilling to purchase imported products (i.e., French wire nails). As a result, sales have been greatly affected, and the standard has a tendency to loosen. However, over 2,000 more barrels of new goods arrived yesterday, further increasing the bottom inventory and weakening confidence. Therefore, it is even more difficult to be optimistic about market conditions.</p>
<h3>Dongbai Iron Actively Trading in Secret</h3>
<p>The Northeastern war is raging, and the British blood on the sea is not yet dry, but some heartless and crazy merchants are already active. Therefore, Dongbai iron flowing on the market has been seen frequently. It is said that the cost for each 3'7" sheet is only about 7 qian, and 5 qian and 4-5 fen for 3'6" sheets, which is about 2 qian cheaper than the current market price of 9 qian per 3'7" sheet and 7 qian and 8 fen per 3'6" sheet for British goods. It has been found that Dongbai iron is also coming to Shanghai in large quantities and being re-packaged into flat iron bundles. However, the patterns are sparse and the quality is hard. The brands previously used were Sanxing, Sun, Yangfang, etc., but now they have been changed to Hongniao, Hongyangzi, and other brands. However, they are still different from British goods. We hope that buyers will pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Coal: Boshan Coal Sales Stalled, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Sales of Boshan bituminous coal have been very sluggish recently. The road and other merchants are not actively purchasing, and local factories are also less eager to purchase. As a result, prices have fallen. Yesterday, the market opened with over 200 tons. Screened lump coal only sold for 10 taels, mixed coal for 8 taels and 7 qian and a half, and coal dust for 8 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<h3>Prices of Two White Coals Fall Again</h3>
<p>The market prices of Hongqi white coal and Shanxi white coal have fallen frequently in the past two months, with a general drop of over 2 taels per ton. However, although selling prices have fallen, sales have remained sluggish. Daily transactions have been only about 100 tons, so market prices are unstable again. Yesterday's market opening prices were 18 taels, 7 qian, and 5 fen per ton for Hongqi white coal, and 15 taels, 7 qian, and 5 fen for Shanxi white coal, down another 2 qian and 5 fen from last week.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Zhabei Continues to Enjoy Peace</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Once Went to Move Relics</p>
<p>Rumors Caused Have Been Settled</p>
<p>Rumors have been circulating in the city for days that Japanese troops are again conducting demonstrations in the Zhabei area. Therefore, the National Salvation Federation has requested the municipal government to increase defense in Zhabei and other areas. At around 11:00 AM yesterday, there was a sudden rumor that a large number of Japanese troops were passing through Zhabei, and the situation suddenly became tense. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency made a special trip to the fifth district of Zhabei and the Zhabei area to thoroughly understand the facts. After detailed investigation, it was learned that the rumors were completely based on misunderstandings. The details obtained are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Moving Relic Silk Nets Causes Many People to Misunderstand</h3>
<p>The reporter conducted a detailed investigation yesterday in the area of Tiantong'an, Baoxing Road, and Qiujiang Road. It was learned that around the 25th, Japanese troops were collecting damaged silk nets and sandbags at the eastern end of the exit of Songhu Road and behind the Japanese Naval Landing Force Headquarters on Huanglu Road, and transporting them to the Pingliang Road yarn factory. As a result, nearby residents were unaware of the contents and became suspicious, saying that the Japanese Navy would take action in Zhabei. The rumors became more and more exaggerated, and it became truer and truer. Fortunately, the municipal public security bureau police officers at the scene immediately explained the situation to the residents, preventing confusion. Therefore, the rumors circulating in recent days that Japanese troops were taking action in Zhabei were entirely due to this misunderstanding. At the same time, it is possible that some troublemakers deliberately created alarm or spread rumors to confuse people.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Japanese Troops Visit Again Caused a False Alarm</h3>
<p>Since our side took over District D, the Japanese Naval Headquarters has repeatedly requested the Fifth District Public Security Bureau to visit the Zhabei area. At that time, the Fifth District refused and did not allow it. Later, a staff officer was sent to the Takeover Committee to make a request, and it was agreed that visits to Zhabei would be allowed on the 28th and 29th. Therefore, on the morning of the 28th, the Fifth District Public Security Bureau sent a motorized bicycle team to guide them to the Dongbaoxing Road, Baoxing Road, and Hongjiang Road areas to avoid confusion and panic among residents. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, the Fifth District Public Security Bureau branch sent a police team to guide them to the District D area for a visit. The Japanese troops visiting Zhabei on these two days were completely unarmed, with about 80 people traveling in cars. However, the residents of Zhabei, still jittery, inevitably became alarmed when they saw this. Some even planned to relocate. At the same time, a group of ignorant people spread rumors in various directions, causing the city to become alarmed, like a tiger in the market and a snake in a cup. In fact, the Japanese troops only patrolled in cars with public security bureau police officers before leaving. The residents immediately felt relieved.</p>
<h3>Traitors Disturbing Public Security, Police Force Sufficient to Maintain Order</h3>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency made a special trip to the municipal government yesterday to inquire about the truth of the matter. A responsible official replied that a detailed investigation had been conducted and there was no factual basis. It was found that the rumors were entirely created by traitors and troublemakers. The police security team stationed in Zhabei by the municipal government has sufficient strength and is more than capable of maintaining the security of the area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Withdrew from the Public University Yarn Factory in Zhabei Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Moved to the Dakang Yarn Factory</p>
<p>Without Notifying Our Side</p>
<p>Riri News Agency said that when our committee member Yu Hongjun of the Joint Committee repeatedly negotiated with Japanese committee member Okazaki regarding the exact date of withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Yinxiang Township Pingliang Road Public University Yarn Factory and the Huxi Toyota Yarn Factory, Okazaki repeatedly said that the troops stationed in the two factories were there before the January 28th Incident. Our Yu replied that the two factories were located in the Chinese concession and should be protected by our police force and could not be permanently stationed there, causing confusion among the people. Later, Okazaki, because our reasons were sufficient, agreed that the troops in District D would withdraw, and the troops in the two factories would continue to withdraw. Since the withdrawal of Japanese troops from District D on the 17th of this month, there has been no indication from the Japanese side regarding the exact date of withdrawal of Japanese troops from the two factories. However, yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the Japanese side suddenly withdrew a platoon of more than 30 soldiers from the Second Battalion of the Japanese Naval Landing Force stationed at the Pingliang Road Public University Yarn Factory and moved them to the Dakang Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road. According to an investigation by a Riri News Agency reporter, although the matter was true, the Japanese side did not notify our side yesterday.</p>
<h3>No Meeting at the Song Residence Yesterday</h3>
<p>Song Suffered from Diarrhea and Temporarily Did Not See Guests</p>
<p>Central News Agency said that Finance Minister Song Ziwen, due to the need to further liaise with various parties in Shanghai regarding the issue of blockading the Northeast customs and reforming the conversion of silver to yuan, came to Shanghai by plane from Beijing the day before yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai, Song felt unwell and immediately asked British doctor McLeish to treat him. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned of Song's condition and other news and reported it as follows:</p>
<p>Song's Condition According to Guo Dehua, secretary of the Ministry of Finance, after visiting Song's residence, told a Central News Agency reporter that Song was planning finances and traveling between Beijing, Shanghai, Pinghan, and unavoidable fatigue. In addition, the weather has been extremely hot recently, and air travel is prone to both coolness and heat. Therefore, Song felt unwell immediately after arriving in Shanghai. Song is currently suffering from diarrhea and has also lost weight. This morning (i.e., yesterday morning), he again asked British doctor McLeish to treat him. It is said that he accidentally caught a cold and was instructed to rest, and he would fully recover in one or two days.</p>
<p>No Meeting Yesterday Song followed the doctor's instructions, closed the door, and declined guests. Therefore, those who went to visit yesterday were turned away. However, Tax Officer Westerner Guo Peng, Jianghai Customs Supervisor Tang Hai'an, and Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Guo Dehua were summoned by Song yesterday morning and spoke for a short time before leaving. Therefore, there was no meeting at the Song residence yesterday.</p>
<p>Recovering and Leaving Shanghai According to reporters, Song was originally scheduled to fly back to Beijing by the original plane last night, but because his diarrhea had not fully recovered, the doctor instructed him not to fly. Therefore, Song decided to stay in Shanghai temporarily and return to Beijing after he had fully recovered. Song's disciple Ziliang took a boat to Mount Lu last night, and it is said that Song also plans to go to Mount Lu after he recovers. Song's wife, Zhang Lehua, is currently vacationing in Mount Lu.</p>
<h3>Blocking Customs Needs Further Consideration</h3>
<p>Our agency's reporter received news yesterday from sources close to the Song family that Song's primary objective during this visit remains the blockade of the Northeast customs, with military expenditure reduction being secondary. It is rumored that the blockade of the Northeast customs will be implemented on August 1st. However, this may not be so rapid, as customs duties are not comparable to postal services. In the future, if Northeast goods are exported from Dalian and shipped to China by sea, how can their origin as products of the puppet state be proven? Tianjin customs is restricted by treaties and is not a central hub for goods entering North China from the Eastern Provinces. Therefore, the central government faces significant difficulties in this matter. In addition to Song, those participating in the discussion of this issue naturally include Zhang Fuyun, the Director-General of Customs; Meilleur, the Inspector General of Customs; Zhang Shouyong, an advisor; and foreign advisors from the Ministry of Finance. These individuals have consistently refrained from divulging any information regarding the Northeast customs issue, indicating the gravity of the matter. They fear that the blockade order, when issued, will exist in name only and lack substance, merely exposing their own weaknesses. Consequently, the central government is cautiously approaching this matter and will not issue a blockade order until fully confident. With only two days left until August 1st, if it is implemented as scheduled, there must be an order from the customs authorities today. As this concerns all parties, the absence of such news suggests that there are difficulties and ongoing discussions, making a swift implementation on the first day unlikely.</p>
<h3>Japanese Oppose Our Double Taxation</h3>
<p>Representation by the Japanese Consul</p>
<p>Tashiro's Opinion</p>
<p>According to the Shih Wen News Agency, the Shanghai Customs authorities plan to levy full import and export taxes on goods shipped from Shanghai to the Northeast starting August 1st, in accordance with the new regulations. In response to this issue, the Japanese Affairs Committee specially appointed Administrative Committee Chairman Yasui yesterday to appeal to the Japanese Consul and to negotiate countermeasures. Simultaneously, Major General Tashiro, newly transferred from Tokyo to Shanghai as the military attache of the Japanese Consulate General, convened meetings with military officers stationed in Shanghai, including Kita, Ogine, Nemoto, and Tanaka, at the Japanese Club for several consecutive days to coordinate all matters.</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul stated that Yasui, the acting chairman of the Japanese Affairs Committee, visited the Japanese Consulate General yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, representing all Japanese merchants, to appeal to Murai regarding the decision by the Chinese Customs to levy full import and export taxes on goods shipped to the Northeast starting August 1st. Murai stated that regarding the issue of Shanghai Customs levying double taxes on goods shipped to the Northeast starting next month, which concerns the entire trade with China, the government has decided to lodge a strong protest when the Chinese Customs begins collecting the double taxes on August 1st. He stated that he had no authority to negotiate with the Chinese government. However, in his opinion, the Chinese government is indeed violating the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The reason given by the Chinese government for levying double taxes on goods shipped to the Northeast is the puppet state of Manchuria's takeover of the Dalian Customs. However, the puppet state's takeover of the Northeast customs was entirely voluntary. All responsibilities should be borne by the puppet state of Manchuria. It is incomprehensible that the Chinese government is not negotiating with the responsible country but is resorting to double taxation, causing undue suffering to our merchants. He stated that he had repeatedly telegraphed the government, urging them to negotiate with the Chinese government as soon as possible. He further stated that the government's reply had arrived in Shanghai, stating that if the Chinese Customs indeed implements this taxation on August 1st, it will lodge a strong protest on the same day. Therefore, he could confidently assure the overseas residents (referring to Yasui) not to panic.</p>
<p>Tashiro's Opinion Major General Tashiro, the military staff officer dispatched by the Japanese during the Shanghai War, has been newly appointed as the military attache of the Consulate General in Shanghai and is deeply concerned with the issues of China's double taxation in the Northeast and countermeasures against the boycott of Japanese goods. Yesterday and today, Major General Tashiro also convened important meetings with military officers stationed in Shanghai, including Kita, Ogine, Nemoto, and Tanaka, at the Japanese Club. During the two-day meeting, there was a detailed discussion regarding the issue of the Chinese Customs levying double taxes on goods shipped to the Northeast and countermeasures against anti-Japanese sentiment. According to the Shih Wen News Agency's reporter, Major General Tashiro expressed his opinion on the issue of China's double taxation during yesterday's meeting, stating that since the Shanghai War, the Japanese merchants in Shanghai have been greatly affected. At that time, even though he was a dispatched military staff officer, he could not protect them to continue their business. After the end of the war, the Japanese merchants tried their best to restore their former state and have been working hard on reorganization until now. Fortunately, they have recovered slightly. However, the Chinese government, under the pretext of the puppet state of Manchuria taking over the Dalian Customs, is implementing import and export taxes on goods shipped to the Northeast. This action by the Chinese government is solely directed against Japan. However, the puppet state of Manchuria and Japan can be said to have no relationship, so why should it take the blame for others? Moreover, this matter is of great loss to our trade with the Northeast. Now, the Shanghai Customs is said to be starting the levy on the first day of next month, so this matter seems to have become a reality. The only way to deal with it at present is to protect it by military force, and there is no other way. Because the transportation of goods into the Northeast cannot bypass any Chinese customs and reach it directly. He believes that this policy of military protection of freight should be implemented simultaneously from the day the Chinese Customs begins to levy double taxes. He is also very willing to work hard to promote this matter to relieve the suffering of our merchants.</p>
<h3>The Xicheng Iron Shop Was Demonstrated Against Last Night</h3>
<p>Two Store Doors Were Smashed and Glass Broken</p>
<p>Onlookers Said It Was Related to Transactions with the Japanese</p>
<p>The Xicheng Iron Shop, located at No. 618 North Suzhou Road, west of Penthang Lane Bridge, was suddenly attacked by several people around 8:00 PM last night. Two store doors were smashed, and all the glass was broken. By the time the police arrived after hearing the news, the perpetrators had already left. A large crowd gathered to watch. It is said that the shop was likely conducting transactions with the Japanese, leading to this unexpected incident as a warning.</p>
<h3>Lin Shi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Discussing Measures to Deal with the Northeastern Postal Blockade with Huang Naishu The Central News Agency reports that Lin Shi, the Director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Transportation, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at around 8:00 AM yesterday. Huang Naishu, the Director-General of Posts, and others welcomed him at the North Station. After getting off the train, Lin immediately accompanied Director Huang back to his residence on Rue du Père Froc to rest briefly and then went to the Postal Bureau on North Sichuan Road to discuss the aftermath of the postal blockade in the Northeast. He only returned to his residence at noon. At 5:00 PM, he went to the United Press to attend the Postal Economic System Research Committee. The reporter met Lin at the North Station yesterday and inquired about various postal issues, to which he replied item by item as follows: (Q) Director Lin, what is the purpose of your visit to Shanghai this time? (A) I am here to discuss the aftermath of the postal blockade in the Northeast with Director Huang Naishu and to attend the Postal Economic System Research Committee. (Q) How will we deal with the illegal temporary post offices set up by Japanese residents in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places? (A) The Postal Bureau is currently investigating the truth of this matter. If it damages our sovereignty, the government will have to negotiate seriously. (Q) Is it illegal for Japanese residents in Shanghai to transport Northeastern mail by Dalian steamers? (A) The Postal Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate this matter. A decision will be made on whether it is illegal after the truth is obtained, and then countermeasures will be considered. (Q) How will we deal with the Japanese side affixing Japanese stamps to mail from the puppet state to various countries and illegally arresting our withdrawn postal employees? (A) This is not only an act of infringement but also undermines the integrity of our country's administrative sovereignty. The diplomatic authorities must lodge a protest. (Q) Is it true that Horiuchi, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy, went to Nanjing to mediate the postal blockade in the Northeast? (A) I have not met Horiuchi, nor have I heard of this matter. (Q) Since the postal blockade in the Northeast, mail to Europe has been rerouted by sea, which is many days slower than by land. How will the Ministry of Transportation remedy this? (A) The Ministry of Transportation is actively pursuing Euro-Asia aviation to make up for this deficiency. (Q) When will Director Lin return to Nanjing? (A) I will stay in Shanghai for about two days before returning to Nanjing. According to staff members of the Postal Bureau, the local office received Northeastern mail sent from Dalian yesterday. All of these mails had sufficient Chinese stamps affixed and were sent before the blockade. No traitorous stamps were found in the delivered mails. If any are found in the future, they will be immediately detained. It is still under consideration whether to detain mails with sufficient Chinese stamps affixed that are sent from the Northeast in the future. As for the Japanese side preventing Northeastern postal employees from entering the customs, after Ba Lide, the Postal Director of the Liaoning District, lodged a strong protest, the Japanese side, realizing their lack of justification, verbally agreed to issue entry permits and promised to provide protection along the way. Ba has reported the previous situation to the General Post Office. As of yesterday, a total of 450 Northeastern postal employees have requested to receive entry permits. These employees will be able to enter the customs within a few days and report to nearby post offices for assignment.</p>
<p>Huge Losses in the Northeast Zhu Menghou, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Postal Bureau, told our agency's reporter yesterday that the real estate, such as postal buildings, etc., in the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang districts, is estimated at more than 2 million yuan. This time, it was seized by the puppet state at the instigation of the Japanese. In addition, the movable property is not included in the total, and the total number is not yet accurately investigated. The annual surplus of more than 2 million yuan will also become a bubble.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Prepare to Enter Customs The General Post Office received a telegram yesterday from Ba Lide, the Director of the Liaoning District Postal Administration, reporting on the entry of postal personnel into the customs. After Ba's repeated negotiations with the other party, they have agreed not to obstruct them any longer and have agreed to issue entry permits. Another report stated that there are more than 450 postal workers concentrated in Shenyang waiting for permits to enter the customs.</p>
<p>Puppet Postal Items Arrive Today After the puppet state forcibly seized our Northeast postal service, the first batch of mail sent from Harbin, Siberia, and other places in the three northeastern provinces to Shanghai was telegraphed to Shanghai yesterday. It has been shipped by the Dalian Fengtian Maru and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 4:30 PM today. The Japanese temporary post office at the Japanese Club has assigned Japanese personnel to pick it up at the dock at that time and then hire coolies to distribute it to various places in this city.</p>
<h3>English China Forum Newspaper's Speech Endangers the Republic of China</h3>
<p>Hosted by American Isaac</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Lodges a Protest with the American Consul</p>
<p>The United States Promises to Give a Warning First</p>
<p>If Ineffective, Hand Over to China for Legal Action</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the English China Forum, published in Shanghai and hosted by an American named Isaac, has radical ideas and strange opinions. It often attacks the Party and the country. Recently, it has taken advantage of the Noulens case to launch a large-scale attack on our country's authorities. Isaac also serves as the secretary of the so-called Committee to Aid Mr. and Mrs. Noulens. The central and municipal authorities believe that it should be suppressed. Mayor Wu filed a protest with American Consul General Cunningham on the 30th of last month, requesting that the newspaper's continued publication be stopped immediately. Cunningham asked Mayor Wu to collect and submit evidence of the newspaper's reactionary content for review. The municipal government therefore analyzed the newspaper's recent reactionary remarks in detail, listing seven points, and sent them to Cunningham. The most noteworthy of these is that Isaac openly supports the so-called "Provisional Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic" in the China Forum, advocating the overthrow of the National Government and inciting class struggle. After receiving the letter, Cunningham telegraphed the State Secretary Stimson of the United States for instructions. It is now known that Stimson has telegraphed the Consul General, stating that if Isaac does not change his past attitude, the US government will revoke his right to enjoy consular jurisdiction. After receiving the order, Cunningham not only warned Isaac of this intention and urged him to reflect on his actions but also sent a letter to the municipal government detailing the handling process. Although the municipal government has not yet received this reply, it will severely sanction the newspaper's reactionary remarks.</p>
<h3>The Fragrance Industry Strike Expands</h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Sent Personnel Yesterday to Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>After the fragrance industry workers in this city went on strike to demand better treatment, the strike completely affected Pudong and the concessions yesterday. Party and government agencies sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Replies to the Fragrance Industry Trade Union The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, considering that all industries are depressed and have not yet recovered after the war, and in accordance with the municipal government's announcement, has advised both labor and management to work together to overcome difficulties. It has issued an order to the union, stating that the request to convene the capital side to amend the labor-capital conditions and increase wages has been noted, and it has been determined that the original energy has not yet recovered after the war, so the request should be postponed. This approval is temporarily stored.</p>
<p>The Strike Expands After the fragrance industry workers in the Nanshi Zhabei area spontaneously went on strike the day before yesterday, the workers in various stores in the Pudong Concession also joined, acting in unison to urge the capital side to wake up. The number of participating stores is 105, with more than 450 workers. However, the employees of the store's front offices, as well as more than 220 people, still worked as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>Party and Government Investigation The Social Affairs Bureau, on account of the spontaneous strike by the fragrance industry workers, dispatched Zhu Guilin, together with Li Weitai of the Municipal Party Department, to rush to investigate the truth in order to verify the matter. The union yesterday submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department, requesting a quick mediation to eliminate disputes. According to the owner of Weishan Zhai, the fragrance industry has been naturally eliminated in recent times, and business has plummeted. They have all reduced their business scope, resulting in a gradual increase in the number of unemployed. They hope that the labor side will embrace a spirit of cooperation, resume work first, and then negotiate a solution, otherwise, they can only let it take its natural course.</p>
<p>Original Conditions Listed The original text of the conditions proposed by the union is listed below: (1) The capital side recognizes the union's right to represent all workers; (2) All employee wages, regardless of apprenticeship or the size of the wages, shall be increased by 40% from the original wages, and the monthly regulations for workers and students shall be increased to 1.4 yuan per month; (3) If the union has a formal meeting and national memorial days, all holidays announced by the Party and government agencies shall be given in accordance with the regulations, and wages shall be paid as usual. The capital side shall not deliberately make things difficult; (4) The working hours for employees shall be from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, but during the seventh and a half to eighth and a half months of the lunar calendar and the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, when night work is allowed, the time shall be from 6:30 PM to 10:00 PM. Employees shall apply for work seven days a month. The packaging department shall stop work on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month, and wages shall be paid as usual; (5) The capital side shall not arbitrarily dismiss employees. If there is illegal behavior, report to the union, and those who decide to dismiss must be supplemented by unemployed personnel who have passed the worker's review; (6) Workers who ask for leave for weddings, funerals, and special events shall not have their wages deducted; (7) The capital side shall not be hostile to workers who are elected as union directors and supervisors; (8) If a worker is sick, the capital side shall bear the medical expenses, and wages shall be paid as usual, up to a maximum of two months; (9) The minimum monthly allowance for employees after graduation shall be 6 yuan, and one apprentice may be received within three years; (10) If the opinions of the workers on both sides disagree and they withdraw, the capital side shall bear one month's wages for one year; (11) The workers' annual fees, section regulations, and church dishes shall all be increased by 40%; (12) All violations of the above items 3, 5, 6, and 8 shall be punished; (13) These conditions shall be implemented after both parties sign and are approved by the Party and government agencies.</p>
<h3>The National Federation of Patriotic Organizations Postpones its Meeting</h3>
<p>Scheduled for August 25th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Organizations, in conjunction with the federations of organizations in Nanjing, Ping, and Tianjin, is preparing to organize the National Federation of Patriotic Organizations. The inaugural meeting was originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai on August 1st. It is now heard that the meeting has been postponed to August 25th due to the urgency of time and the inability of representatives from distant provinces and cities to gather as scheduled. The preparatory meeting resolved yesterday to postpone the meeting to August 25th and designated the Da Zhonghua Hotel in Shanghai as the reception staff for representatives from all parties. The Shanghai Federation will bear the costs of board and lodging. A circular telegram has been sent to organizations in various provinces and cities, which reads as follows: Nanjing Sandao Gaojing Sanxinli Capital Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, Tianjin English Concession No. 14 Road 173 Federation of National Salvation Organizations, Beiping West Side Dahongluo Factory No. 11 Federation of National Salvation Organizations: The telegram of acceptance has been sent. Our association originally scheduled the inaugural meeting for August 1st. Now, due to the long distance and the inability of representatives from various places to gather as scheduled, it has been decided to postpone the meeting to August 25th. Representatives from your association are requested to postpone their departure. At that time, the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road in the Shanghai English Concession will be designated as the reception office. The Shanghai Federation will bear the costs of board and lodging. This is hereby reported, and it is hoped that you will inform everyone of Chengping. Preparatory Office of the National Federation of National Salvation Organizations, Yan.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors Met Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Extra-Settlement Road Construction Case Remains Undecided</p>
<p>Increased Tuition Fees at Chinese Public Schools</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors convened its last meeting before the summer break at 4:30 PM yesterday. Because the meetings must be suspended several times from next week until they are convened again in September, the details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Extra-Settlement Road Construction Issue Regarding the extra-settlement road construction issue, the Municipal Council has recently made some revisions to the original draft agreement. Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Fessenden, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, have conducted several rounds of consultations. The content is the issue of foreign residents residing in the extra-settlement road construction area. Because the Municipal Council does not have the right to directly manage foreign residents, it was proposed for discussion at the previous regular meeting. The result of the discussion was postponed to yesterday for further discussion. In addition to reporting on the contacts with our municipal government authorities, Director-General Fessenden resolved to send a letter to the Consular Body to solicit opinions. The original text of the content will be issued today but has not been announced.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Increased Tuition Fees for Chinese Schools It was also discussed to increase tuition fees for Chinese schools under the jurisdiction of the bureau. According to the original plan of the Municipal Council, starting from the next semester of this year, the tuition fees for the secondary school part will be increased from 40 yuan to 48 yuan, and the primary school part will be increased by 3 yuan. After the Chinese Directors objected, it was decided at yesterday's meeting to increase it by 4 yuan in the next month of this year and another 4 yuan next year. The primary school part will not be increased for the time being.</p>
<p>Settlement Amnesty Incident Recent statistics show that there are more than 7,000 accumulated prisoners in the Huade Road Prison in the Public Concession. Since the National Government issued the amnesty decree, about 2,000 people have been pardoned in the concession. The Municipal Council believes that the release of a large number of pardoned prisoners may hinder the security of the concession. It was also proposed for discussion at the last meeting. At yesterday's meeting, the Director-General slightly communicated with the Chinese Directors, hoping that after the release of a large number of pardoned prisoners, the public groups and hometown associations in the concession could provide the bureau with assistance in separately repatriating or providing funds for them to make a living. All the Chinese Directors present agreed. The meeting adjourned at 5:15 PM.</p>
<h3>The Northwest Reclamation Corps Will Depart for Suiyuan on August 1st</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Presents Travel Expenses and a Written Inscription</p>
<p>Samsung Cotton Iron Factory Specially Donates Uniforms</p>
<p>The Frontier Society Hosted a Farewell Dinner Yesterday</p>
<p>Scheduled to Host Reporters This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Northwest is an important area for our country's national defense and industrial development. Reclamation in the Northwest is related to the safety and security of our country's foundation and the happiness and suffering of people's livelihoods. Yan Ziduan and others, aware of this, have organized the Northwest Reclamation Corps, which is scheduled to depart for Suiyuan on August 1st to conduct investigations. Yesterday, Huang Jingwan, a representative of the Chinese Frontier Society, specially hosted a farewell dinner for the departing personnel at the Yunji Sichuan Restaurant on Sanma Road. Mayor Wu Tiecheng also presented travel expenses and the four characters "Jueyu Shuguang" (Dawn in a Remote Region). In addition, the Samsung Cotton Iron Factory also specially made and donated uniforms to the departing personnel. The corps is scheduled to host the local press at the Qingnianhui Building on Baxianqiao today at noon. The establishment process of the corps, etc., is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment Process According to the corps leader Yan Ziduan, speaking to our agency's reporter about the motivation and establishment process of the Northwest Reclamation Corps, the corps was established in July last year. At the National Vocational Education Discussion Conference, there was a proposal to develop the frontier to find a way out for young people. An implementation outline was drafted and submitted for discussion. At that time, there were different opinions on developing the frontier of the province and developing the Northeast. After I explained that the Northeast already has 30 million people, allowing them to develop on their own, and that it can be postponed for the time being, although there are wastelands in various provinces waiting to be reclaimed, it is not related to the overall situation. Only the Northwest is empty and is also the passageway for Euro-Asia transportation. If we do not plan for it now, I am afraid that it will not be ours in the future. Moreover, the progress of a country should be based on balanced development as a principle, and a comprehensive plan is especially necessary to avoid abuses. As a result, the atmosphere of the entire venue became tense, and the outline was unanimously passed. If we can get the government's promotion and capitalists' participation, it will not be difficult to compete with foreign business groups such as the South Manchuria Railway Company and exclude them. In the middle, it was suspended for several months due to disaster relief and anti-Japanese resistance, and it was postponed again and again until the preparatory committee was established in October last year. Then the plan was finalized, the charter was properly drafted, and it was not until today that it was able to depart for investigation. This is the general situation of the motivation for the organization of this corps and the process after its establishment.</p>
<p>Departing Personnel On August 1st, the departing personnel include Ms. Wen Duanshen (a graduate of the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University), Corps Leader Yan Ziduan, Corps Members Cai Songmin, Lin Weiru, Fang Lifang, Zhou Xuede, Zhu Wenjian, Zhang Jianchu, Xiao Tianhen, Feng Yikang, Li Ji'an, Chen Peisheng, Hu Biaoyi, and Yan Hannan, a total of 14 people.</p>
<p>Hosting Reporters The corps specially issued invitations yesterday, inviting reporters from various newspapers and news agencies to the Qingnianhui Building on Baxianqiao to report on the departure investigation and future plans.</p>
<p>Departure Declaration As the European War comes to an end, the world is showing active progress. The center of the world has shifted from the Mediterranean and Atlantic Oceans to the Pacific Ocean, and the scope is expanding. Therefore, the European War broke out because of the Balkan issue and ended with the United States joining. The real world war in the future may be triggered by the China issue. Our pioneer and visionary Sun Yat-sen foresaw this and wanted to use the International Development of China's Industrial Plan to eliminate disasters before they take shape and to save the overall situation of the world. Unfortunately, it was not implemented, and Mr. Sun died with his ambition unfulfilled. The industrial plan lists the Northwest Grand Railway first, and its importance is evident. The martyr Zhu Zhixin has also spoken with emotion. The comrades of this corps once suggested to the government that a Central Engineering Bureau be organized to complete this railway as its own responsibility, but it was not adopted. In a situation of helplessness, the Northwest Reclamation Corps was initiated. Knowing that a mayfly is not enough to shake a mountain and that a lone army is setting in the sun, we secretly want to imitate Lu Yang's waving of his halberd. Now, Outer Mongolia is independent, Tibetan bandits are pressing in, and natural disasters and man-made disasters are intensifying each other. The Northeast is also hearing about the Japanese army invading. The people of the country fear the imminent demise and do not know what plan to come up with. Moreover, the trouble in the world lies in what ordinary people do not realize. The Northeast must have today, or it will be even worse than today. The reason lies in the decades ago, due to the people of the country not knowing how to cherish it. Comparing the Northeast to the Northwest is like comparing the great Tokyo earthquake in Japan to the Pingliang earthquake in Gansu. The people of the country only know the intensity of the earthquake in Japan, but they do not know that the earthquake in Gansu far exceeds it. The dangerous situation in the Northeast is already fully known to the people of the country. The dangerous situation in the Northwest is ten or a hundred times that of the Northeast, and the people of the country still do not know it. The wealth of the Northeast has been made known to the world because of Tanaka's active policy. It is not known that the treasures of the Northwest are beyond the dreams of the people of the country. Some say, "With such a small private group, to carry out such a huge global undertaking, isn't it absurd?" I will answer, "No." Doesn't the guest observe the South Manchuria Railway and the East India Company? Under the resistance and jealousy of foreigners, they can still flourish and grow, and destroy human countries without knowing it. Therefore, although this corps is small, it has the support of the government above and the support of the people of the country below. If we say that it will be ineffective, I do not believe it. However, there is one word that I cannot but attach to this, that the people of the country are usually drunk and confused, and they are unwilling to slightly divide their minds and resources on the fundamental national plan to jointly support it. Once disaster strikes and the country is in danger, they are so busy and exhausted that they have to reluctantly break their stingy bags to make the final patch, and it is already too late. This invisibly wears down social vitality and is extremely regrettable. It is also like the people of the country all know that construction is the key plan, but they are unwilling to pool their efforts to achieve it. By the time social order is not guaranteed, before the knives and cauldrons, raising military expenses is a painful and difficult task, and they can do it on the spot, squandering huge sums of money in a place where nothing exists. Repeating the cycle, it will inevitably lead to national destruction and species extinction. How different is it from a person not knowing hygiene, working hard for a day, and diseases arising, but willingly suffering the pain of surgery and medication, and not stopping until the vitality is greatly damaged? This kind of mentality, if the strings are not changed, the national situation will never be saved. My colleagues are alarmed by the imminent disaster and struggle in the midst of difficulties. We have already organized and established this corps and strive to be the vanguard of the people of the country. The personal livelihood problem is solved by it, and the strengthening of national defense and the development of the frontier will benefit both the public and the private sectors. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost, and to collect the mulberry elm in the east. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3>National Self-Salvation Association Established Today</h3>
<p>Fulfilling the Original Intention of Resisting Foreign Goods</p>
<p>Chu Hui-seng, Li Yong-xiang, Pan Xu-lun, Hu Feng-xiang, Li Ci-shan, Yu Zhong-xian, Pan Xu-sheng, Chen Song-yuan, Zhu Wen-qi, Lu Xing-zhuang, Lu Feng-zhu, Cao Zhi-gong, Zhang Yi-chen, Wang Zhao-cheng, Zheng Ze-nan, Chen Ya-fu, Li Wen-jie, and others, have organized the National Self-Salvation Association, scheduled to be formally established today. The announcement is recorded as follows: Respectfully, in recent times, foreign troubles have become increasingly urgent, and inferior goods have arrived like a tidal wave. If we do not work together to save ourselves, ruin is imminent. After several meetings, we have specially initiated the National Self-Salvation Association to thoroughly fulfill our original intentions. The organizational charter has been drafted and finalized, and the inaugural meeting is scheduled for 5:00 PM on the 30th of this month (Saturday). We hope that you will take time out of your busy schedule to attend and jointly plan for action. This matter concerns the grand plan of saving the country. We hope you will not hesitate to contribute.</p>
<h3>Recovery of Yangtze River Steamers Difficult to Resume Quickly</h3>
<p>Japanese Persisting Vigorously</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Japanese steamers have been suspended for a long time. The various shipping companies are trying to resume operations, and the Japanese government has allocated funds to subsidize them. It was originally scheduled to be implemented on August 1st, but due to the "Blood Souls Assassination Squad" incident in Shanghai warning treacherous merchants, it had to be temporarily postponed and other countermeasures sought. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Failure to Resume: The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (Japanese Shipping Company) currently operating on the Yangtze River route has three vessels on the southern route: Nanyo Maru, Hoyo Maru, and Joyo Maru; two vessels on the northern route: Kazan Maru and Tozan Maru; and two vessels on the southern route: Rozan Maru and Sozan Maru. All have been suspended due to the impact of the boycott. The Shanghai manager, Mr. Yoneri, had planned to resume operations on August 1st. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency recently interviewed a senior official of the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, who stated that the Japanese merchants' plan to restore shipping is being kept strictly secret. However, due to the ongoing and intense Chinese boycott of Japanese goods, each time a Japanese steamer sails, it is loaded with transshipped Japanese goods. Chinese goods are nowhere to be seen, and there are very few Chinese passengers. In addition, the recent actions of the "Blood Souls Assassination Squad" have dealt a major blow. It is reported that the planned resumption on August 1st has now been postponed, but the reporter has learned that the Japanese are proceeding very vigorously.</p>
<p>Current Routes: The Dalian Steamship Company mainly operates on the northern route, currently operating only the Hoten Maru, Dairen Maru, and Tientsin Maru. The Osaka Shosen Kaisha mainly operates on foreign and northern routes. The foreign routes, such as those to Europe, South America, Africa, and New Zealand, are still operating as usual. Only the northern routes, such as those served by the Seikyo Maru, Choshu Maru, and Fukien Maru, are operating. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) is dedicated to foreign routes, such as those to Hong Kong, Bombay, Europe, New York, Seattle, and San Francisco, all of which are operating as usual. Although the above three companies have been subjected to the Chinese boycott movement, they have not been greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Chinese Consulates Abroad Required to Certify Goods - Japanese Business Groups Object</h3>
<p>Shi Wen News Agency reports: Japanese business groups in Shanghai, including the Shanghai Japanese Business Federation, the Cotton Textile Industry Association, and the Chamber of Commerce, object to the Chinese government's planned implementation on September 1st of a policy requiring Chinese consular certification of goods. All goods valued at over 200 yuan that are to be transported into the Chinese mainland must first be certified by the Chinese consul in the place of origin and a fee of 1.05 customs gold units (approximately 8 Japanese yen) collected. The aforementioned Japanese business groups believe that most Japanese merchants in Shanghai operate on a small scale, and shipments of goods worth two or three hundred yuan to Shanghai are common. They are determined not to pay the consular certification fee in addition to the import tax. Therefore, they held an emergency meeting at the Japanese Residents' Association last night to discuss countermeasures. As a result, it was resolved that the above-listed groups would send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the name of their organizations, requesting that it negotiate with the Chinese government to cancel this new measure. The telegram was sent out at 8:00 PM last night. The groups will reconvene to discuss further measures once they receive a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Maritime Circles Again Fight to Recover Foreign Pilotage Rights</h3>
<p>Regarding the recovery of pilotage rights, the Shanghai maritime community exerted all its efforts to fight for it last year. During the Shanghai Battle this year, enemy ships entered and exited Wusong, transporting troops and equipment, all guided by members of the foreign pilotage association, aiding the enemy and endangering national defense. If pilotage rights had been recovered earlier, the Japanese troops would have had no way to enter the country during the January 28th Incident, let alone penetrate Liuhe to cut off our reinforcements. The outcome is uncertain. Therefore, it is felt that striving for recovery is an urgent task. The Shanghai Merchant Marine Masters Association yesterday submitted a petition to the Maritime Affairs Bureau, requesting that it be forwarded to the ministry, to vigorously fight for the recovery of maritime administration and pilotage rights, with March 5th of next year being the date of expiration of the foreign pilots' permits. The original text states: "We petition that the pilotage at the mouth of the Yangtze River and the coastal port administration are controlled by foreigners, aiding the enemy and endangering the country, which has been seen repeatedly. We request that this be forwarded to the ministry to vigorously fight for recovery, replace them with Chinese, to eliminate great harm and secure national defense. We have investigated the origin of the foreign pilots at the mouth of the Yangtze River. It is neither related to any treaty nor based on any legal position. It is simply an act of aggression against our country by imperialists in the past, forming a non-descript organization. Since the establishment of this organization, for six or seventy years, they have relied on their special power to occupy territory, monopolize traffic, and meticulously plan to oppose the government and undermine sovereignty at any time and in any place. Whenever there is war, these foreign pilots openly lead foreign warships into ports, attacking and aiding the enemy. This has been seen repeatedly. In the distant past, during the Sino-French War of the Qing Dynasty, the French warships that attacked the Min River and defeated our navy were led by an American pilot holding a customs license. The facts of losing the army and humiliating the country are recorded in Moore's public law, which scholars of public law in various countries have described as a strange tale. More recently, during the January 28th Incident, all enemy warships transporting troops and equipment, entering and exiting ports, were piloted by members of the foreign pilotage association, helping to attack our Shanghai, reflecting and echoing each other, known throughout the country. Other places in the Yangtze River were able to penetrate deeply, launching flanking attacks on the 19th Route Army, thanks to them. Therefore, for decades, the harm caused by foreign pilots has been great, endangering national defense. The facts are clear and not an exaggeration on our part. In July of last year, the Maritime Pilot Training Institute and the Hydrographic Survey Bureau received an order from the ministry, stating that the Executive Yuan had telegraphed the customs, ordering the suspension of the issuance of new permits to foreign pilots from July 1st of that year. Unexpectedly, after investigation, the Inspector General of Customs single-mindedly favored and protected foreign pilots, ignoring the government's orders and continuing to issue permits. According to our country's pilotage examination regulations, which were promulgated and implemented on March 5th of the 20th year, foreign pilots would not be allowed to serve after March 5th of next year. Our country originally planned to hold this examination last year, jointly organized by the Ministries of Finance, Communications, and Navy, but it was quickly shelved and has not been realized. The key to this lies in the secret machinations of these foreigners, whose influence is all-pervasive, a lamentable situation. Furthermore, regarding the suspension of the issuance of new permits, the Executive Yuan had issued a clear order, but the Inspector General of Customs openly resisted and violated it, yet all parties turned a blind eye, allowing it to continue to this point. What else can be said? The foreign pilotage association has ulterior motives, which did not begin today. Examining their behavior, they are no less than an organized espionage group. The credo of the association is to keep the secret conditions of the port channels as the primary task. Other shipping regulations and service records are not important. Proof of this can be seen in the troubles caused by the association members since July 1st of last year. The most obvious examples are the changes to the Indian ship in November and the collision of the Buddan steamer with the dock on July 6th of this month. The responsibility of the members is invariably covered up. The inside story is that there are secrets that cannot be revealed, and they dare not take overly aggressive actions. In short, the existence of this association is a hidden danger to our country, posing a great danger to national defense and military affairs. What has been stated above is mostly past fact. Your bureau is the only competent maritime administration agency of the government in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It seems that you cannot feign ignorance and allow the foreign pilots and customs officials to collude with each other to plot against us. You should consider the overall situation, forward a request to the ministry, make a firm decision, eliminate concerns, recover foreign pilotage in accordance with the time limit stipulated in the examination regulations, replace them with Chinese, and vigorously fight for the Ministry of Finance to order the customs to hand over coastal port administration to the Maritime Affairs Bureau for management. Even if things do not go as desired, you may as well disclose all the details and make them public opinion. Even if it fails, it can still be declared innocent to the people and leave a good name to posterity. Compared with those who procrastinate and are perfunctory, harming themselves and the country, the magnitude of the gains and losses is almost incalculable. Today, the world is in decline and people are lost. Our association, as a technical group earning a living through labor, is fortunate to be living in this world. Lacking the ability to seek favors, we do not avoid taboos, and speak frankly. Whether it is appropriate or not, we hope you will review and approve it." This document was delivered yesterday.</p>
<h3>International Trade Association Suggests Imported Foreign Goods Must Be Labeled with Origin</h3>
<p>Emergency Plan for Import Surplus Country</p>
<p>Guo Bingwen, Chairman of the International Trade Association, yesterday submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry, stating: "We submit a petition to the Ministry of Finance to clearly stipulate rules that imported foreign goods should be labeled with the name of the country of origin in clear characters on the conspicuous place of the goods' packaging and boxes. We respectfully request adoption and implementation. It is our understanding that China's industrial and commercial sectors are still immature, and the output of domestic goods is insufficient to meet demand. It is necessary to import and sell essential foreign goods to meet domestic needs. Exchange of goods is a natural matter. However, imported goods vary in quality, and their costs vary due to the nationality and status of the country of origin. It is a loss to the national economy to import more than export, and it is necessary for people's livelihood to seek economy by choosing the superior and selecting the excellent. For example, if the goods of country A have a lower cost, lower quality, and easier transportation, but in order to obtain a better price, they imitate the higher quality and more expensive goods of country B at the time of import, or even change their appearance and re-enter from other countries, it will inevitably lead to fish eyes mixed with pearls, increasing the burden on buyers, and causing double losses to the national economy and people's livelihood. The great loss is unbearable. Article 304 of the US tariff law clearly stipulates that imported goods must have a mark of origin, otherwise there will be additional taxes, no delivery, and penalty rules. The United States is an exporting country, and it severely cracks down on foreign goods entering the country. Last year, China's import surplus reached 500 million yuan. How can we continue to ignore this? The association, at its fifth board meeting, resolved to petition the ministry to suggest that the Ministry of Finance establish specific rules that imported foreign goods should be labeled with the name of the country of origin in clear characters on the conspicuous place of the goods' packaging and boxes, otherwise, higher taxes will be levied, or delivery will be prohibited. Those who cheat and deceive will be severely fined and strictly enforced by customs, hoping to slightly benefit the national economy and people's livelihood, and also protect international commercial ethics. Whether it is appropriate or not, we have prepared a document and translated the full text of Article 304 of the US tariff law, requesting adoption and implementation, and requesting instructions to follow."</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Meeting of the Money Trade Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association held a newspaper committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than ten people attended, chaired by Qin Runqing. There was a long discussion on issues such as the Money Trade Joint Reserve and the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan. Regarding the Reserve, it was decided in principle that it should not engage in business activities with external parties. All exchange-drawing peers are members of the Reserve's funding foundation. Yuan-character shops among the small peers (small peers are those who do not engage in exchange-drawing, and are divided into Yuan, Heng, Li, etc.) can also join as ordinary members. The Reserve's charter was also revised once and will be submitted for further discussion at the meeting on August 2nd.</p>
<h3>Fifth Meeting of the Autonomy Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>Wu Kaixian and Four Others Appointed as Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Autonomy Preparatory Committee held its fifth preparatory meeting yesterday afternoon. Yu Hongjun, Xu Peihuang, Wu Xingya, Luo Jingyou, Wang Zhijing, Yang Zu, and Shen Tong, seven committee members, attended. Chairman Yu resolved: (1) to appoint Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Huaixu, and Tong Hangbai as four additional committee members, bringing the total number of committee members to eleven, including the previous seven. Letters of appointment will be sent and they will be invited to attend the next meeting. (2) Regarding the budget of 350,000 yuan for temporary expenses proposed last time, for careful consideration, and with the addition of four new committee members who will attend the next meeting, the budget will be temporarily reserved and will continue to be discussed jointly at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>H.H. Kung's Trip Abroad Postponed</h3>
<p>Suffering from a Cold, Not Yet Recovered</p>
<p>H.H. Kung was ordered to go to Europe for inspection and was originally scheduled to depart on the first of next month. However, he suddenly caught a cold three days ago, and after seeking medical treatment, he has not yet recovered. Furthermore, Mrs. Kung is far overseas, so the family is very anxious. The date of departure must be postponed.</p>
<h3>Huang Boqiao and Shen Yi Departed for Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Participating in the Two-Roads Recovery Construction Conference</p>
<p>The Municipal Government previously planned to recover the Songhu Railway and return it to municipal management, and consulted the Ministry of Railways. The director of the Public Works Bureau, Huang Boqiao, and the director of the Engineering Bureau, Shen Yi, were sent to Beijing yesterday to participate in the Two-Roads Recovery Construction Conference, where this matter will be discussed in detail. However, the Railway Bureau has not yet expressed any opinion on this matter. According to Ding Xingheng, Secretary of the Bureau, who spoke to the East China News Agency yesterday, the Songhu Railway is an auxiliary branch of the Jinghu Railway and was built with loans from Sino-British companies. Therefore, the amount owed by the road itself to Sino-British companies cannot be determined. On the operational side, daily income is only over 1,000 yuan. If the Municipal Government recovers it, it will need to purchase locomotives and other equipment in the future, which will be extremely difficult. Director Chen is scheduled to go to Beijing tonight to participate in the second meeting of the Two-Roads Recovery Construction Conference to be held tomorrow to discuss this matter. It is also reported that this issue may be resolved at today's meeting.</p>
<h3>Changes to the Building Permit Application Procedures for Wusong and Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Engineering Bureau Sets Up Permit Issuance Offices in Both Locations</p>
<p>Since Wusong and Jiangwan districts were devastated by war, most of the houses and dwellings need to be rebuilt and repaired. In order to facilitate the people and meet the actual needs, the Municipal Engineering Bureau has been approved by the Municipal Government to set up permit issuance offices in Wusong Town and Jiangwan Town. At the same time, in order to rectify municipal administration, the permit application procedures for the two districts have been changed. Although projects that were previously exempt from permits must now obtain permits, no permit fees will be charged, as a gesture of consideration. The bureau's announcement is recorded below: Announcement regarding the 128 Incident, the houses and dwellings in the Wusong and Jiangwan districts were mostly destroyed by artillery fire. Now that the situation is gradually stabilizing, these destroyed houses all need to be rebuilt and repaired. In order to facilitate the people in the two districts and meet the actual needs, this bureau has been approved by the Municipal Government to set up permit issuance offices in Wusong Town and Jiangwan Town to handle the issuance of permits and the survey and guidance of all repairs. At the same time, the permit application procedures have been changed. All projects that were temporarily exempt from permits in the two districts will now be subject to the city's temporary building rules, that is, projects such as building single-story houses with less than ten rooms and repairing fences must apply for permits in accordance with the regulations before work can begin. However, no permit fees will be charged to alleviate the people's difficulties. In addition to renting a house on Kuizhao Road in Jiangwan Town to set up a permit issuance office, the Wusong Town permit issuance office will be temporarily located in the office of the municipal commissioner before a house is rented. Furthermore, the municipal commissioners of the two districts have been ordered to stop accepting reports on single-story houses from August 1st. This announcement is made for all to know.</p>
<h3>National Anti-Drug Conference Scheduled</h3>
<p>Date: August 29th to September 2nd</p>
<p>Location: Hangzhou YMCA</p>
<p>The National Anti-Drug Representative Conference convened by the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association was originally scheduled to be held in the spring, but was postponed due to the impact of the war. The Standing Committee of the Association recently resolved to hold it at the YMCA and the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters on the shores of West Lake in Hangzhou on the anniversary of the Treaty of Nanjing, August 29th of this year. The main purpose is to unify the national anti-drug movement, thoroughly eliminate the opium public sale, and urge the government to strictly enforce the ban on smoking. All representatives traveling to and from the conference have been agreed upon by the Association and the Railway Department to be given certificates entitling them to a 50% discount on train tickets on all lines directly under the Railway Department. Preparations in Hangzhou are being handled by the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association at 6, Lane 3, Shangnongli, Qingnian Road. Preparations in Shanghai are being handled by the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association at 4 Hong Kong Road. It is reported that representatives from anti-drug groups in more than 40 places, including Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanjing, Hankou, Ningbo, Singapore, Batavia, and Taiwan, have registered. More than 20 proposals have been received. It is reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Hangzhou Municipal Government all welcome the conference. The Municipal Government has also allocated a portion of the scenic area of Pinghu Qiuyue for the Association to establish a Lin Zexu Anti-Drug Memorial Hall. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<h3>Postal Workers' Representatives from Various Places Arrived in Shanghai from Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that postal workers' representatives from various places gathered in the capital to hold a national joint discussion meeting of postal workers. The meeting closed yesterday morning. All 50+ representatives, at the invitation of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, took the express train to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, arriving at the North Station at 11:20 PM. The Postal Workers' Union military band and Boy Scouts went to the station to welcome them in advance. Other unions that arrived upon hearing the news included Li Yongxiang, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Ye Xianggao, Long Peiyun, and Shao Xubai. After arriving at the station, they were led by the welcoming personnel to the reserved hotels for rest. A Dagong News Agency reporter spoke with Mr. Dai Zeyi, a representative, who said that they plan to stay in Shanghai for about four or five days and intend to pay tribute to the battlefield and participate in the memorial service for the martyrs of the Shanghai postal workers. If they have time, they also plan to investigate the labor movement in the city.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qiqing, Director of the Shanghai Radio Station, Resigns</h3>
<p>All Employees Jointly Petition to Retain Him</p>
<p>Since Wang Chongzhi, Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, resigned, directors of radio stations across the country have been submitting their resignations one after another. Zhu Qiqing, Director of the Shanghai Radio General Station, also submitted his resignation to the General Bureau yesterday. Upon learning of this, all personnel of the Shanghai Bureau and employees of the various branch stations believed that Director Zhu had been in office for five years and that all design and construction projects were successfully created by him, making many contributions to our country's radio administration and being a rare specialist. Furthermore, he was extremely kind to superiors and subordinates. Therefore, more than 300 employees jointly submitted a petition, each stamping their seal, unanimously requesting him to stay. Last night, the joint petition was sent to the General Bureau on Muir Road for review.</p>
<h3>Jianghuai People Organize the Jianghuai Water Conservancy Promotion Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Declaration</p>
<p>Wu Yibai, Dai Shouyue, Lu Yuheng, Liang Yidong, Wang Muzun, Chen Chaobi, Shen Ziping, Zhao Junhao, Gu Jianwu, Zhu Difei, Chen Shaozeng, Yi Ziting, Xia Qifeng, Ding Jiansan, Ding Xiasheng, Ding Jimin, Ge Gongzhen and other Jianghuai natives in Shanghai initiated the Jianghuai Water Conservancy Promotion Association and issued a declaration yesterday, saying, "In recent years, floods have occurred frequently in Jiangbei, especially the disastrous disaster last year, which was unprecedented. More than 40 sections of the canal embankment collapsed, stretching over a thousand feet. The disaster area reached more than 200,000 square miles, the loss of property reached more than 400 million yuan, and the loss of life has not yet been accurately counted. Alas, it's a tragedy! We believe that the success or failure of Jianghuai water conservancy depends on the success of waterway management. However, waterway management and river diversion are closely related. The Huai River originates from Anhui and Henan, and converges in Anhui and Jiangsu. It flows eastward through Hongze Lake, passes through Zhangfu River to Matou Town, and enters the canal southward. It exits Sanhe Dam, passes through Gaoyou, Shaobo, and other lakes, and also enters the canal. Therefore, the Huai River uses the canal as its tail to divide and enter the rivers and seas. If you want to manage the canal, you must first divert the Huai River. This is an unchanging truth and an inevitable trend. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang Ji of Nantong published the Jianghuai Water Conservancy Plan, which determined the cost of diverting the Huai River and managing the canal to be 80 million yuan, but it was not implemented due to lack of funds. Now, experts in water conservancy at home and abroad have different opinions. The proposal for diverting the Huai River, entering the river or entering the sea, has not yet been decided. Although diverting the Huai River is indeed a fundamental solution, the project is huge and cannot be done in a short period of time. Managing the canal is a temporary solution, but thinking about it as a second best is also a crucial step. According to the records, in the third year of the Republic of China, the Jiangsu provincial authorities planned to develop Jianghuai water conservancy and convened Jianghuai gentry to discuss the construction of the inner canal project. It was initially assumed that the cost would be 1 million yuan, with 600,000 yuan taken from the farmland donation of 20% per mu in Huaiyang counties, and the remaining 400,000 yuan from the additional collection of 20% on canal cargo donations and the levy of canal shipping donations. The Jiangbei Canal Project Bureau was established, and in the ninth year of the Republic of China, the dredging bureau was reorganized into the Jiangsu Canal Project Bureau, which published a plan for the annual construction of the canal, with a budget of 3 million yuan. Unfortunately, the plan was never realized. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Canal Works Office was merged into the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Construction Department, resulting in its existence in name only, and the great disaster in Huaiyang began. Therefore, the Jiangbei Canal Project Aftermath Committee was born in response to the breach. However, this is only a plan for repairing the breach and the plan for managing the canal are two separate matters. The plan for managing the canal was announced more than ten years ago. Before the canal embankment collapsed last year, where were all the completed projects that could protect the counties in the lower reaches of the canal? Alas, the authorities treat water conservancy projects related to the national economy and the people's livelihood as child's play, or even as a source of profit, sweeping the people's blood and sweat into their own pockets. What responsibility should the so-called canal management experts bear? Will they use the outdated survey and mapping charts of empty talk to redeem our millions of lives and properties? Every time we think of the location of our ancestors' graves and the safety of our lives and properties, we are shocked and have to make plans to prevent future disasters. Therefore, based on our conscience, we jointly organize a group and plan to gather water conservancy engineers at home and abroad to research and improve, not to call for help after the event, but to plan in advance, so that the east and west embankments of our canal can have appropriate projects to protect our country, and then seek fundamental solutions. This is what we hope. In addition to separately formulating articles of association, discussing and resolving matters according to law, and submitting an application for registration, we hereby declare."</p>
<h3>The Enthusiasm of Applicants for Tsinghua University</h3>
<p>Reached More Than Two Thousand Eight Hundred People</p>
<p>A telegram from National Tsinghua University in Peiping stated that the number of applicants for the summer examinations in Peiping and Shanghai has broken all previous records and exceeded expectations. There were 2,201 applicants in Peiping and 617 in Shanghai, totaling 2,818. Previously, Tsinghua University had a maximum of 1,500 applicants each year. This year, the number has suddenly increased by nearly one time, which is due to the school's academic achievements and economic facilities being superior to other schools. Also, yesterday noon, the chief examiner of the school, Mr. Pu Jisheng, hosted a banquet for the proctors at the Tsinghua Alumni Association in this city and explained the proctoring procedures at Daxia University on Zhongshan Road today. No less than twenty or thirty people attended, which was quite a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Overview of the American Bus Industry</h3>
<p>News from the American Commercial Counselor's Office in China</p>
<p>The American bus industry is developing rapidly and occupies an important position in automobile transportation. Recently, the National Bus Association has been established, and the surge in buses, from only 10,000 in 1921 to 100,000 in 1931, is enough to show its rapid progress. Buses can be broadly divided into public and private. Public buses, such as long-distance buses, electric road buses, and steam road buses, are used exclusively for public transportation. Private buses, such as school buses, tour buses, hotels, and other businesses' buses. In 1931, the total number of buses in the United States was 98,000, with public buses accounting for slightly less than 50% and private buses accounting for slightly more than 50%. Electric tram companies in the United States have more than 12,000 buses to supplement their main electric tram business. Among private buses, approximately 48,500 are owned by schools and 3,000 are used for passenger tours. In 1931, public buses traveled 1,808,000,000 miles and carried 1,802,000,000 passengers. In that year, the government's income from this item reached 378,000,000 US dollars, and the investment amount reached 397,000,000 US dollars. Bus revenue was 300,000,000 US dollars in 1926 and 378,000,000 US dollars in 1931. However, at the same time, steam train revenue decreased from 1,000,000,000 US dollars to 555,000,000 US dollars, and electric train revenue decreased from approximately 950,000,000 US dollars to 750,000,000 US dollars. From this, we can see the rise and fall of buses and other transportation industries. The business of steam trains and electric trains relies on the branch lines of buses for promotion. However, the former's roads are shrinking and becoming shorter, while the latter's routes are increasing. The number of miles of highways in the United States is 3 million, of which 700,000 miles are bus routes. The total number of miles of highways in the world is 80,000 miles, and the total number of cars in the world is 35.6 million, with the United States accounting for 75% of them. Moreover, cars manufactured in the United States account for 87% of the world's total. This is a general overview. In the United States, there are more cars than telephones.</p>

<h3>Summer Resort: Gaohang Beach</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of Facilities and Transportation</p>
<p>Shanghai lacks the scenery of lakes and mountains. During the hot summer, those who are tied to their duties are busy all day long. Apart from taking walks in the park during public holidays, there are few places to relax and escape the heat. Especially during long, hot days on rest days, they are only trapped between mosquito swarms and sweat. Foreigners in Shanghai often go to the beach for a swim on their days off. The blue water, layered waves, sandy sails, wind gulls, floating and sinking among them, can filter out the mundane. In recent years, Chinese ladies have also been learning to swim. The Municipal Public Works Bureau has specially opened roads and arranged bathing beaches to promote national sports. Is it just for leisure and escaping the heat?</p>
<p>Facilities The bathing beach is located on the coast north of Gaohang Town in Pudong, with yellow sand like a belt and vast waves. The deepest part is only shoulder-deep. Even those who do not know how to swim can stand upright in the water. The shallow part is only ankle-deep. Red flags are planted all around the beach as markers. Beyond this, the sea water gradually deepens, and even those who can swim shallowly should not risk going forward. Behind the sandy shore, on the green grass, wooden houses are built and surrounded by blue and white canvas curtains. Inside, there are tables and chairs, as well as soda, beer, meals, candy, etc., for tourists to rest. There are also umbrellas and couches on the sandy shore for guests to sit on. On both sides of the house, there are more than ten wooden pavilions for changing clothes and washing, which are available for guests to use for six cents per room. The water basins and soap towels provided are very clean, but the lack of a shower after sea bathing is a regret. Swimsuits are also available for rent, but they are knitted. Those who are not used to swimming may easily catch a cold if they wear them, and there are not many available. It is better for visitors to prepare their own set, which is more suitable for use.</p>
<p>Transportation Although it takes three changes of boats and cars to get from Shanghai to the bathing beach, the Public Works Bureau has arranged everything well, so there is no suffering on the journey. Tourists first take the municipal ferry at the Bund Bronze Man Wharf. A special class costs half a yuan per person and goes directly to Gaohang. The ferry is the most well-equipped on the Huangpu River. The ferry seats are spacious and the cabins are clean. Upon landing at Gaohang, there are buses waiting there. The fare from the wharf to Gaohang Town is only one cent. After getting off the bus, you have to take a rickshaw. The Public Works Bureau stipulates that the fare is four cents per rickshaw ride, and staff are dispatched to direct the rickshaw drivers and serve as receptionists, so the order is orderly and convenient for tourists. The whole journey takes about two hours. If you take the first ferry (departing at 7:00 am), you can reach the bathing beach at about 9:00 am.</p>
<h3>Chen Xing Accused of Abandonment</h3>
<p>Yan Shufen Files an Appeal</p>
<p>The Hearing and Debate Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Chen Xing, courtesy name Jian'an, the general manager of the Central Bank, once hired Yan Shufen, the cousin of Yan Dunyuan, the former Minister of Internal Affairs of the Beijing government, as his wife. At that time, Chen was still studying in Shanghai and was very poor. He often had difficulty paying for tuition. Fortunately, his parents-in-law had keen eyes and knew that their future son-in-law was not an ordinary person. Therefore, they did not hesitate to spend money to cultivate him in the hope of making him successful. Chen also worked hard to improve himself. After graduating from a Shanghai school, he went abroad for further studies. Unexpectedly, in the autumn of his success, he forgot the kindness of his parents-in-law and left Shufen behind. He married Miss Cai and after returning to China, he did not treat her well. He left his fiancée alone in her boudoir, wasting her youth. Shufen is now forty-two years old. Last year, she filed a lawsuit against Chen for abandonment and other reasons, requesting a consolation payment of 100,000 yuan. At the beginning of the trial, Chen presented evidence proving that Shufen had married Fu Rui (courtesy name Wu Tui), the nephew of Fu Jiang (courtesy name Xie Chen), the former Shanghai Tao Yin, in the old capital. Although they separated on the wedding night, there was still a flaw and it was not appropriate to stay together for life. Therefore, the first instance resulted in Yan Shufen being defeated. However, the woman firmly denied marrying Fu, only admitting that because Chen had not married her for a long time and had repeatedly indicated that he wanted to break off the engagement, her parents had arranged for her to be engaged to Fu Rui. When the auspicious day arrived, the woman vowed not to serve two husbands and cut her hair to show her determination. The marriage contract was naturally terminated. Chen said that the wedding ceremony had been held, which was a malicious slander and damaged her reputation. She was very unwilling to accept this and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and specially invited Fu Wu Tui to come from the north to testify, proving that no wedding ceremony had been held that year. Since Miss Yan did not want to be my spouse, I had no choice but to give up and seek another partner. The judge then suspended the trial and advised both parties to reconcile outside the court. If it was difficult to reconcile, they should wait for Chen to be summoned to court for a continued trial. However, the suspension has lasted for several months and the peace talks have made no progress. Therefore, the Second High Court held a collegial panel hearing again yesterday morning. Chen Xing said that he had to attend the research meeting on abolishing the tael and changing the yuan and could not attend the court. His lawyer Zhang Zhirang appeared in court on his behalf. Lawyer Jiang said that the appellant had never arrived and this time he was summoned but still did not arrive for excuses, causing the case to be delayed again and again. Chen had previously been supported by the Yan family and there had been several witnesses to prove that he had been favored. Now there is Xu, who also knows about his gratitude and can testify. Then Xu detailed the story of the old lady's repeated financial assistance. Lawyer Jiang continued to present several letters from Chen to Yan Shufen after returning to China, saying that the words in the letters were all Chen's words of regret and there was no intention to break off the engagement. This shows that Chen could not fulfill the marriage contract and had other difficulties. The reason why he did not come to court in person was that he was ashamed of the appellant. After the two sides debated, the official ordered them to withdraw and wait for a scheduled verdict.</p>
<h3>Married Daughter of a Comprador of a Foreign Firm Sues for Inheritance</h3>
<p>Father Died and Younger Brother Died Early</p>
<p>Now Sues Her Brother's Wife</p>
<p>Sun Jingfu, courtesy name Jingchen, the comprador of the leasing department of the Pacific Foreign Firm, had been in office for more than 30 years and accumulated a lot of wealth. He was considered to be a well-off family. He died on August 4 last year. He had one son and two daughters. The eldest daughter, Ji Zhang, married Tao early. The youngest daughter, Yi Zhang, has not yet married. The son, Bin Xuan, died five years before his father. Fortunately, he had married Zhu Lingxian and left behind three sons, Wenliao, Wenlan, and Wenda, and one daughter, Hongyu. Tao Sun Ji Zhang, after her father Jingchen passed away, said that her father had a lot of inherited real estate, cash deposits, and shares. According to current laws, married daughters also have the right to inherit. Therefore, she repeatedly negotiated with her brother's wife, Sun Zhu Lingxian, requesting a share based on the shares. However, Zhu Lingxian said that the property in her possession was all purchased by her husband, Sun Bin Xuan, and did not come from her uncle. She refused to split it. Tao Sun was not willing to give up, and recently investigated her father's property clearly. As far as she knew, in terms of real estate, there were (1) houses and land in Chaoyangli, Tiandian Road, all registered by the Gao Yi Consulate, (2) 21 buildings of Chunfang City houses and a piece of vacant land on the north side of Elcock Road, and 13 and a half city houses on the south side, also registered by Gao Yi and leased by the Pacific Foreign Firm, (3) a residence in Changkangli, Dong Han Bili Road, two houses, and four city houses, (4) one city house on Yalu Road, (5) 2.67 mu of vacant land on Zhaofeng Road. Only Chaoyangli was jointly purchased with Chen Guangchang, Sun got three shares, and the rest were all purchased by him alone. In terms of deposits, there were (1) 25,000 taels in the Mercantile Bank, (2) 27,000 yuan in the Siming Bank, (3) approximately 20,100 taels in commercial deposits, (4) approximately 2,000 taels in current silver accounts, (5) approximately 2,000 yuan in current foreign accounts, (6) 23,000 yuan in mortgage from Wu Yaoting at 491 Huishan Road. In addition, there were 4,000 taels of Shanghai Municipal Council 6% bonds. The combined value of these two types of movable and immovable property should reach hundreds of thousands. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court, requesting that she be allowed to split the property equally with Sun Zhu's children. The petition also stated that her brother Bin Xuan had been suffering from hemoptysis for a long time and had never lived independently. How could he have the financial resources to purchase property? Sun Zhu intended to swallow it all and did not hesitate to reverse black and white. She should be thoroughly investigated and judged according to law to protect her rights. The case was originally scheduled to be heard by Judge Shen Hong yesterday morning, but due to time constraints, it could not be questioned, so a separate date must be set for a summons hearing.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Dies in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>Zhang Hanchen Dies of Serious Injuries</p>
<p>The Authorities Should Provide Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>At 9:40 pm the night before, Sun Jiming, a patrol police officer from the Second District Municipal Public Security Bureau Branch, was patrolling with a Mauser pistol at the intersection of Xiejiao Liyuan Road and Xinqiao Road. Suddenly, three bandits shot the police officer in the left leg and snatched the Mauser pistol. At the same time, a police officer named Zhang Hanchen heard the alarm and rushed to assist in the arrest. He was also shot in the waist and other parts by the bandits. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the two injured police officers were sent to Shanghai Hospital yesterday. Zhang Hanchen, the injured police officer, was in ward 6 of the fourth class of the hospital. Because the bullet hit his waist, his internal waist, lungs, and stomach were broken. He did not have time to be treated and died at 5 am yesterday. Xie Zhongyi, the police inspector of the Liyuan Road Branch, led Tong Patrol Captain and others to Shanghai Hospital at 11:30 am yesterday to prepare a coffin and collect the body, and then submit a request for preferential treatment. The patrol police officer Sun Jiming was shot through his left leg and his life is not in danger. Now, Zhang Dongkai, the district chief of the Second District, believes that the two bandits dared to rob police officers of their weapons and shoot and kill police officers. The matter is of great importance. He has ordered Han Ruisheng, the leader of the detective team, to supervise the detectives and strictly order them to arrest the suspects within ten days to solve the case.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Communists Escorted to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Approximately 100 Communists arrested by the Public Security Bureau at Caojiadu Republican Theater and the North Railway Station were transferred to the Capital yesterday after being transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. They were divided into two cars and attached to the Beijing-Shanghai night train that evening. The Garrison Department sent two platoons of guards to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Residents of Daodeli Petition to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The residents of Daodeli, Kai Zi'er Road, were notified by the landlord, Shen Shumei, through the Pingzhiming Foreign Firm, on the pretext of renovation, to move out. Although the residents' representatives entrusted lawyer Yu Hualong to negotiate with the landlord, they were rejected. The residents of the lane specially appointed five responsible representatives, including Shao Runsheng, to go to the Municipal Government to petition yesterday. Secretary Chen received them and the representatives explained the situation, saying that we, the common people, have suffered from the hardships of the strike and unemployment during the January 28 Incident. The landlord is eager to force us out of our houses, and wants to put hundreds of tenants to death. Secretary Chen comforted them with a few words and left.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Prepare to Establish Epidemic Hospitals</h3>
<p>Wu Xingya and Others Prepare to Establish an Epidemic Hospital. Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the rampant epidemics after the war, and the recent hot weather, which is becoming more fierce, the epidemic-stricken civilians are in urgent need of relief. Therefore, in his private capacity, he united with Shanghai celebrities to initiate the organization of an epidemic hospital. He has been running around for the past few days and has some clues. Yesterday, he specially invited the initiators to the Xinghualou on Fourth Horse Road to discuss fundraising methods. Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Yang Xiaotian, Chen Renhe, Qin Runqing, Wang Binyan, Gu Xinyi, Zhu Yaxiong, Zhang Binghui, and more than ten other people were present. Other initiators, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xiaolin, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yiting, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, Chen Bingqian, etc., were unable to attend due to leaving Shanghai for business. The discussion was very successful. It is said that Mr. Du Yuesheng, in order to speed up the process, is willing to advance 5,000 yuan to start the business first. The remaining initiators will raise funds separately. It is said that Mr. Zhang Binghui will temporarily manage the hospital affairs, and Mr. Zhu Yaxiong, a famous doctor in Shanghai, will be in charge of medical affairs. Mr. Zhu is not only well-versed in medicine, but also enthusiastic about social welfare. The doctors hired by the hospital are all famous doctors in Shanghai. They will survey the location in Zhabei within days and actively carry out the work. They should be able to start treatment at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation Establishes Epidemic Hospital. The pain suffered by the citizens of Shanghai during the January 28 Incident is indescribable. Although normalcy is gradually recovering, the prevalence of cholera, which causes rapid death, makes citizens uneasy. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation, in view of this, decided at a meeting yesterday to establish an epidemic hospital in order to facilitate the citizens. It plans to select a suitable location in Zhabei and invite well-known Chinese doctors who have returned from overseas to provide medical treatment and free medicine. It is now actively underway and is said to be opening soon.</p>
<p>Nanhui Epidemic Hospital of the Red Cross Society Established. After the Japanese invasion, the poison was extremely deep. All parts of Songhu are plagued by epidemics, and Nanhui, which is close to Songhu, is also affected by the remnants of the poison. Recently, epidemics have been seen everywhere, and deaths have followed one another. Xu Baiyi, the president of the Red Cross branch in the county, works in a certain department of the National Government, and specially donated a large sum of money to prepare for the establishment of the Red Cross Epidemic Hospital. Last month, he had exhausted all efforts to prepare, so he came to the Shanghai General Association to consult with doctors. Dr. Zhou Hongzhang introduced Zhang Dichen and Zhou Honggeng, high-achieving students of Southeast Medical College, as the directors of medical affairs of the hospital. They went to work a few days ago. The hospital is purely charitable and does not charge any fees.</p>

<p>The weather has been hot recently, and epidemics are prevalent. Therefore, it is not uncommon for people who are infected to die in an instant. There is a gem merchant named Lai in the Jiumu Di area of the city. His family of eleven, including two servants, died a total of seven people within ten days. The details are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Lai, a gem merchant from Nanjing, is about fifty years old, and his wife is of the same age. He has seven children, the oldest being twenty-one years old and the youngest being ten years old. The other children are all one or two years apart. The family has two servants and lives alone in a house. He has a gem shop in Qingdao and buys and sells gems in Shanghai, which is quite prosperous. Therefore, he has accumulated 40,000 to 50,000 yuan and can be called a happy family.</p>
<p>Wife Falls Ill First. A week ago, his wife suddenly contracted cholera. Although he sought medical treatment, the epidemic was very severe. She died within a few hours. While the funeral was being arranged, the wife had not yet been coffined. A son contracted the same disease. Lai was extremely anxious and hired Chinese and Western doctors to treat him, but it was still ineffective. He died within two days. Within ten days, one wife and five sons died one after another.</p>
<p>Servant Sent to the Hospital. Suddenly, the servant contracted cholera the day before yesterday. Neighbors and friends advised Lai to send the servant to the hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, after the servant was sent to the hospital, Lai himself fell ill and was bedridden. Although several famous doctors in Shanghai were hired every day, the doctors were helpless. Seeing this disease, relatives and friends were afraid and did not dare to visit. After being repeatedly advised by a close friend, he went to a certain hospital for treatment yesterday. Seven people died. Only two sons and one servant were left in the family. One of the sons also contracted cholera a few hours after his father went to the hospital for treatment. When he fell ill, they all said that they had headaches and fever. The patients had the same symptoms. This son also died within a few hours, and no one was left to take care of the funeral. Later, relatives and friends helped to take care of it. Within ten days, a family of eleven died one wife and six sons. He himself is still in a dangerous situation and it is not known if he can escape the danger.</p>

<h3>Husband Shoots Adulterer Case</h3>
<p>The Adulterer is Severely Injured and Unable to Appear in Court</p>
<p>The Hearing is Postponed to August 8th</p>
<p>Wang Xingsheng, a local carpenter residing at No. 2 Wangjiazhai, Gaolangqiao, because his wife, Wan, was being seduced by Yao Guishan, a rattan craftsman from No. 52 next door, and abducted in March of this year to Zhoupu, Pudong, was found and brought back by Wang. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, at 2 p.m., she was again lured to a clandestine meeting at the 16th Piling, which Wang discovered. Concealing a pistol, he followed her to No. 33 Yuxing Street, outside the Xiaodongmen in the French Concession. When he saw Yao, Wang immediately drew his pistol and fired two shots into Yao's lower back. He then turned around and tried to escape in a rickshaw, but was intercepted by the police near Xinkaihe, who arrested Wang and his wife and took them to the police station. Yao was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The next day, the police sent Wang and his wife to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention, pending the victim's recovery. The situation has been reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Wang Gangxu presided over a continued trial in the Criminal Division. He first asked the police detectives about the victim's injuries. It was reported that the victim, Yao Guishan, had not yet recovered from his injuries. The doctor said that due to his weak physical condition, he could not undergo surgery to remove the bullets and needed to rest before a decision could be made. Then, Wang Xingsheng's mother-in-law, Wan Zhou, was called as a witness. She testified that "Xingsheng is my son-in-law, and Wan is my daughter. They have been married for nine years and have two children, a nine-year-old boy and a dead baby girl. My daughter had an affair with Yao Guishan, which I knew nothing about. Yao never came to my house. I don't know anything about Xingsheng shooting Yao Guishan with a pistol. The pistol was not taken from my house; I don't know where it came from. My daughter was found and brought back from Zhoupu in March and worked at the Dasheng Factory, living in my house. I don't know if Xingsheng came to my house on the day of the incident. I was working in the field and don't know if he and my wife discussed shooting Yao Guishan. I know nothing about it." Wang Wan was ordered to appear in court. She testified that on that day, Yao Guishan came to Linqing Road to ask me to go to the 16th Piling. My husband did not go with me and did not come to my mother's house. The pistol was held by my husband. This gun was actually given to me by Yao this spring, instructing me to kill my husband. I couldn't bear to do it, so I put it in the house. My husband didn't know that I went to the 16th Piling that day. I probably came to look for me. I didn't discuss it with my husband beforehand. Wang Xingsheng testified that the pistol was taken from the bed in the house. At about 1 p.m. that day, I went to my mother-in-law's house and didn't see my wife. Someone said she went south, so I went home, took the pistol, and chased her to Yuxing Street in the 16th Piling and shot Yao. I didn't discuss it with my wife beforehand. Now it is wrong for me to hit him, but he was the first to be bad. I beg the court to forgive me, etc." Finally, the defendants' lawyers, Zhang Ji and others, stated that "if the victim dies as a result of the injury, the defendant should bear criminal responsibility. However, the hospital is not providing medical treatment now, and if the death is delayed as a result, that is another matter, and the court should pay attention to it." Judge Wang verified the statements and ordered the hearing to be postponed to August 8th. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Wu Jianguang's Son Arrested for Summons</h3>
<p>Continued Hearing Yesterday on Enticement of a Young Woman Case</p>
<p>Wu Zhongliang, the son of the blind man Wu Jianguang, was recently sued by Shen Ai'e, a female employee of the Commercial Printing House on Jiujiang Road, and her mother, Shen Chu, in the First Special District Court for enticing a young woman. The Special Court had already held one hearing on the case, but Wu failed to appear in response to the summons, so the court ordered him to be summoned to court. The situation has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, another hearing was held, but the defendant, Wu Zhongliang, still failed to appear. According to the plaintiff, Shen Chu, the defendant has definitely not left Shanghai. The other night at 9 p.m., someone saw him passing by on a certain road in a rickshaw. According to Chinese constable Jin Wanrong, he went to Wu Jianguang's residence to order the defendant to appear, but Wu said that Zhongliang had severed his relationship with his father, so his whereabouts were unknown. He still refused to accept the summons. After verification by Judge Wu Tingqi, it was determined that the defendant had repeatedly failed to appear, indicating an intentional evasion. He was immediately ordered to be arrested. Wu Zhongliang was ordered to appear in court again on August 3rd for another hearing.</p>

<h3>Opening of Shenjiahang Stores</h3>
<p>The conflict between the Shenjiahang shop guards and the militia, which led to a market strike, has been going on for several days. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., Yu Yuanjue, a staff member of the Municipal Government Reorganization Committee, and Yao Benyuan, the director of the Seventh District Second Precinct, persuaded the stores to reopen, and they all resumed business as usual. The cause of the strike will now be traced and stated below to clarify the truth. It was discovered that after 10 p.m. on the 24th, someone was singing obscene songs on the street in front of the Chi Peide Pharmacy of Shenjiahang. The police officer on duty, No. 4769, of the Seventh District Second Precinct, believed that singing obscene songs was harmful to public morals and violated police regulations, so he stepped forward to dissuade the singing and the audience, who immediately dispersed. However, Lu Shengxian, a partner in the Chi Peide Pharmacy opened by Wang Shishan, the platoon leader of the town's militia, suddenly had a conflict with the police officers. Afterwards, the patrol officer reprimanded the police officer, saying that his actions at the time were inappropriate. After the station chief returned to the station, he learned about the previous situation and punished the police officer with twenty slaps as a warning. He also invited Wang Shishan, the owner of the Chi Peide Pharmacy, to the station to explain what happened. When Wang returned, he encountered the reprimanded police officer, and the two sides disagreed, resulting in another conflict. Ji Longsheng, a police officer from the same shift, saw his brother being bullied and stepped forward to help. Afterwards, the precinct believed that the police officers' actions were crude and did not meet the standards of a police officer, so it sent the two police officers who caused the trouble to the Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>

<p>Submission</p>
<h3>Preface to the Siku Grand Dictionary by Wang Yunwu</h3>
<p>Because Wen Tianxiang said, "Where to start with the Seventeen Histories?" Therefore, modern people often say, "Where to start reading the Twenty-Four Histories?" In fact, the Twenty-Four Histories only have more than 3,200 volumes and more than 28 million words, which is not much compared to the more than 79,000 volumes and more than 700 million words of the Siku Quanshu. Even the Siku Quanshu, if typeset, printed, and bound in ordinary fonts and formats, would amount to at most 10,000 volumes, which is even less compared to the libraries in Paris, London, Washington, etc., which have more than 4 million books. But we have never heard readers in those libraries—especially readers in the Washington Library of Congress—say "Where to start reading?" Last year, when I traveled to Europe and the United States, I spent ten days reading books in the Washington Library. I actually browsed through more than 1,000 books and magazines on scientific management in the library's collection of more than 4 million books. Some people suspect that this may not be true. In fact, it is not at all false, because the library's catalog cards are compiled very completely. As long as you review the various catalog cards in the catalog room according to direct and indirect related titles, you will see all kinds of important books, collections, essays, and related categories, as well as the names, volumes, versions, publication dates, content, nature, abstracts, and related works of each book, as well as the names, eras, qualifications, academic achievements, and other works of each author. After reading the various catalog cards of each book, we already understand its general idea, and then we take them separately and borrow the books that must be read. Then, we check the index of each book to find the parts that must be read. Thus, the books that must be read account for only one ten-thousandth of the entire collection, and the parts that must be read account for only one thousandth or one hundredth of the books that must be read. In this way, searching for one grain of rice in the vast ocean of books is not difficult, and there will be no difficulty in "Where to start reading?"</p>
<p>In addition to these convenient reference library catalog cards, there are many other reading tools in Europe and the United States, such as book dictionaries, essay indexes, and book and newspaper abstracts. Most of their compilations are arranged alphabetically, which is convenient for checking and can be understood at a glance. Therefore, the reading community will not have the difficulty of "Where to start reading?" Chinese bibliography has always been known for its sophistication, and there are many works on bibliography, but they often detail one book and one thing, making it difficult for readers to get a general idea. Moreover, the classification is too broad, making checking very inconvenient. There is no book dictionary arranged alphabetically that can give people a general idea. Liang Rengong (Liang Qichao) had a plan to compile a Grand Dictionary of Chinese Books before his death, but he did not complete it. Mr. Yang Jialuo is well-versed in bibliography and is also engaged in the compilation of the Grand Dictionary of Chinese Books, making continuous progress. He first completed a Siku Grand Dictionary, using the general catalog of the Siku Quanshu in 200 volumes as the record, and the books and authors recorded in the Cunmu as the scope. Each book name and person name within the scope is established as a separate entry, with more than 17,000 entries and more than 2.5 million words. The book name entry includes the number of volumes, appendices and their number of volumes, the name of the author or annotator, category, annotation, and version. The author entry includes the names of the books written or annotated, the author's era, origin, a short biography, the names of works not included in the Siku, and reference books for the author's detailed biography. In addition, in order to facilitate checking, it is arranged according to the dictionary style, using my Four-Corner Numeral Indexing Method. After the draft is completed and sent to print, I am asked to write a preface. I believe that this book is consistent with the dictionary-style book dictionaries of Europe and the United States mentioned above. It is the first most applicable and most convenient book dictionary in China. It can eliminate the difficulty of "Where to start reading?" that the Chinese reading community has always felt. Therefore, on the one hand, I hope that Mr. Yang will complete the work of the Grand Dictionary of Chinese Books as soon as possible. On the other hand, I am very happy to introduce this book to the reading community.</p>
<p>This book was previously sold by subscription. The academic community, such as Academia Sinica (President Cai Yuanpei said it was an extremely useful work), the Ministry of Education, Central University, Peking University (President Jiang Menglin said that Chinese academic thought is embodied in it), Tsinghua University, Yanjing University, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhejiang University, Wuhan University, the Palace Museum, Peking Library, Oriental Library, Nanjing Library, and provincial, municipal, county, and private libraries, have all subscribed to it. Its value and necessity can be seen here. The upper volume has already been published, and the lower volume will be printed soon. It is published by the Chinese Book Grand Dictionary Editorial Office, No. 17 Yongji Lane, Avenue Road, Shanghai, and sold by Shanghai Kaiming Bookstore and its branches in various places. The price is 24 yuan, and the subscription price is 18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor, we saw in your newspaper's local news column, "Yesterday the price of Chinese yarn in the Yarn and Cloth Exchange rose sharply, while the price of Japanese yarn suddenly fell." According to our exchange's market, the regular buying and selling is based on yarns such as the Ren Zhong brand listed in the grade table. The statement that the price of Japanese yarn suddenly fell should not refer to the transactions of brokers in our exchange's market, and there may be a misunderstanding. This letter is for your information, and we hope that you will publish it in the letter column for correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, July 29th.</p>

<h3>Common Sayings and Their Origins</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>With nothing to do during the long summer, studying common sayings from various places is also a way to pass the time. Common sayings can be general or specific; general common sayings are not limited to a particular place, while specific common sayings are only used in a certain area. People from other places will not understand them, simply because the common sayings contain a backstory.</p>
<p>"Xiao Er of the Qi Ziqing Family Never Says Good Things" || This is a Suzhou common saying, the origin of which is found in the "Double Gold Ingots" storytelling song. The Suzhou lawyer Qi Ziqing hired a servant boy named Xiao Er, who never said good things. Since then, whenever people encounter someone who doesn't say good things, Suzhou people would mock them as "Xiao Er of the Qi Ziqing Family".</p>
<p>"The All-Heaven God of Huangjin Dam is Fake to the Core" || This is a Yangzhou common saying, recorded in the "False All-Heaven God" novel written by Shi Tianji. It is said that in Huangjin Dam, Yangzhou, a country bumpkin claimed to be the descent of the All-Heaven God, stirring up the people who all went to burn incense. Before long, Governor Jin saw through the deception and exposed the fraud, and the affair ended in failure. Later, whenever people encounter something fraudulent, they say, "The All-Heaven God of Huangjin Dam is fake to the core".</p>
<p>"The Dragon Causes Disaster, the Mangy Turtle Takes the Blame" This is a Jinling common saying, found in the "Supplement to the Firm Gourd Collection" by Chu Shinong. It is said that in the early Ming Dynasty, the Dragon caused trouble around Shangqing River. Because Emperor Zhu was very superstitious, the Ministry of Public Works dared not say dragon in their report, only saying that large turtles were the problem. The Emperor, because the character for turtle was the same as the Yuan Dynasty's Yuan, ordered fishermen to kill all the turtles. Fishermen fished for turtles, using bottomless jars to cover the turtles' heads, rendering them immobile. Later, whenever encountering a situation where one thing is substituted for another, people say: "The dragon causes disaster, the mangy turtle takes the blame."</p>
<p>"The Shiitake Mushroom Mountain Cat Cries Blindly" | This is a Wenzhou common saying, found in "Miscellaneous Poems from Two Windows" by Wang Chaoqing. It is said that in the mountains of Ou and Yue, shiitake mushrooms are widely cultivated; to prevent rat damage, people always capture wildcats, gouge out their eyes, and raise them in the mountains. Once the cats are blinded, they do not go elsewhere, only crying blindly day and night. The rats, hearing the sound, avoid the area. Later, whenever people encounter ignorant people shouting nonsense without end, they say: "The shiitake mushroom mountain cat cries blindly."</p>
<h3>Slogans on the Soil in the Trenches</h3>
<p>— Wang Yu</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, our 19th Route Army bravely resisted, holding out with isolated troops against the enemy's several times larger forces for as long as thirty-two days and nights. This greatly surprised the enemy, and even European and American military experts were amazed. Enemy newspapers especially praised the trenches dug by our army, calling them "of a certain country's style". Soldiers lying in the trenches were not threatened by artillery fire, causing the enemy to waste ammunition. Airplanes also could not see the trenches, so their bombs missed their targets. The soldiers lying in the trenches could wait at ease for the enemy to approach, then leap out and win as easily as reaching into a pocket to take something. Our army's ability to win with fewer men was truly not accidental. A friend of mine went to the front lines during the war and entered the trenches himself. According to him, the trenches were very spacious, and the soldiers inside were exceptionally calm, not paying attention to the enemy's frequent bombardment. They would not fight unless the enemy launched an attack. Therefore, foreign newspapers commented that the January 28th Incident was a "fake war", even "humorous", because the continuous sound of gunfire in the war zone came from the enemy, while our army rarely retaliated. It was as if a strong man was using his fists and feet against a weak man, but the weak man did not use the same violence against the strong man, yet still managed to win. Therefore, the soldiers in the trenches were even leisurely, some using porcelain shards from broken bowls to embed words into the soil as slogans, such as "Defend Our Land", "Drive the Japanese Imperialist Army Out of Our Territory", "Respond Calmly", "Vow to Live and Die with This Trench", and "Wash Away the Shame of Non-Resistance", showing great ingenuity. How could one not win when facing such a formidable enemy with such calmness? If Shirakawa had not ambushed Liuhe and had engaged in a frontal assault, our army, though small, would not have retreated. Moreover, if the government had sent reinforcements earlier and heavily defended Liuhe, even if Shirakawa had attacked with heavy forces, wanting to attack our army's rear, Liuhe would have been heavily defended, and we would not have retreated. But alas, the government did not send reinforcements, letting the miraculous feat of thirty-two days and nights of bloody battle be ruined in one fell swoop. Is this not greatly regrettable?</p>
<h3>The Second Flood</h3>
<p>— Huang Ren</p>
<p>The recent floods in England have prompted research by scientists. According to one expert, there will be a second flood within 30,000 or 40,000 years, turning the entire world into a swamp. Saltwater will sweep across the five continents, with only a few pieces of dry land remaining on the highlands. The Netherlands will be completely submerged. The Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey in England will become aquariums, with fish swimming back and forth because most of the British Isles will be under water. The Sahara Desert, which is extremely arid, will also turn into an ocean. Only the tips of New York's skyscrapers will be visible above the water.</p>
<p>According to some scientists, the previous Ice Age has only passed halfway. The climate of the world is already turning warmer. The large ice floes in the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans are gradually melting and drifting into other oceans. The ice floes in the Arctic and Antarctic originally covered 12 million square miles, but half of that has already melted. If the other half completely melts, the world will inevitably undergo a transformation. Even now, many coastal villages in England have been submerged in the water over the past twenty-five years. In one place, you can still see the spire of a church.</p>
<h3>Cold Talk in Hot Weather</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>The map of the Northeast Provinces has changed. It's gradually slipping out of the blurred minds of the Chinese people. No wonder a large number of Japanese goods are flooding into the ports along the Yangtze River. Since the world already has such a useless group who don't strive for self-improvement, why would Japan love China and not show off its might in Rehe? Some say Rehe is already in critical condition, while others say Rehe should be safe. Especially Nanjing, which still maintains a nonchalant attitude, only exhausting Liu Adou, who can't figure out what's going on and secretly complains.</p>
<p>Fresh Living Dead: A Pair of "Great Rasus". Mr. and Mrs. Niu Lan were able to revive from a feigned death thanks to the fact that famous Chinese scholars and high-ranking officials of the Party and the State advocated humanitarianism. Indeed, China treats foreigners with respect for human rights everywhere. You come, and I retreat. You are tough, and I soften. You go straight to the point, and I am evasive and procrastinating. But foreigners don't respect human rights when it comes to us. What can you do?</p>
<p>If this year is still destined to try the suffering of floods once again, I think it's better to let the victims live or die on their own. Otherwise, the foreign wheat and flour bought with tens of millions of foreign debt will end up in the bellies of bureau chiefs and section chiefs. It's truly an offense to the gods and a violation of heavenly laws. It's unnecessary.</p>
<p>Shanghai has changed, reaching Luoyang. But now Luoyang is much calmer. Mount Lu and Guling have risen to meet the selection of outstanding people and auspicious lands. Some say that China will one day be forced to hold a meeting on the Pamir Plateau. I think this saying has great philosophical meaning. The Pamir Plateau is said to be the birthplace of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Trees that are thousands of feet tall have leaves that fall back to their roots. There's nothing strange about it. As long as this fall doesn't break your neck, then go back to the old nest to enjoy the cool breeze. What's the harm?</p>
<h3>Cries of the Distressed</h3>
<p>— Ge Chonglou</p>
<p>The domestically produced film "Humanity," which recently premiered, appealed on behalf of the general public who are starving, freezing, and helpless. Many people who watched it shed tears, just like me. It shows that everyone has a compassionate heart. In fact, the portrayal of the disaster area in "Humanity" is just a small fragment. The misery of the drought in Shaanxi (my hometown) cannot be fully described in a single article or film. The most tragic scene in "Humanity" is when, in order to save her dying grandfather, a woman sacrifices her own son in exchange for a little grain. This doesn't even mention cannibalism, friends eating friends, and relatives eating relatives, the so-called "exchanging children for food." During the most severe period of the Shaanxi disaster, it was not a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>But was the Shaanxi disaster, with its hundreds of miles of barren land and millions of deaths, entirely due to the weather? I want to boldly say here that, although the Shaanxi drought was due to lack of rain, most of it should be attributed to the local authorities' oppressive policies. Because they usually exploit the people so much that they have no savings, when there is even a slight drought, it becomes unmanageable. As far as I know, during the Shaanxi disaster, the farmers were selling their farm tools, while the Shaanxi authorities were buying large quantities of weapons.</p>
<p>The suffering of the Shaanxi people is unspeakable, and I feel unable to express it all. Finally, I want to tell the public that the drought in Shaanxi is getting worse. In Wugong County alone, the population used to be over 200,000, but now only 70,000 remain. And those good people have no choice but to sit and wait for death. I hope that the government authorities and compatriots across the country will unite to save the survivors.</p>
<p>Brief news: Today (30th), the Ping She Opera Troupe has been invited by the Qin Family Mansion to perform at the Great Eastern Theater. The repertoire includes "The Wagtail Temple", "Yutang Chun", "Drunkenness", "Empty City Stratagem", "New Changban Slope", etc., which will be quite splendid. (If it is he)</p>
<h3>Nationally Made Factories Worth Introducing (14)</h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>(Two) (Three) Marble Factories</p>
<p>Recently, Western-style wooden furniture often uses stone as the surface material, taking advantage of its whiteness and resistance to oil stains. Our country imitates Western wooden furniture, so we have to buy it. The annual loss is not small. Those with patterns are commonly called marble. Pure white ones are called Alum Stone. The ones from Italy are considered superior, followed by Japanese stone. In fact, marble is produced in Yunnan, China. The patterns are natural, and the nature is hard. It is not comparable to the so-called marble mentioned above. Moreover, the value is quite high. Now it is not easy to obtain large materials. It can only be used for inlays, screens, and hanging screens.</p>
<p>Our country has also produced stone materials used on Western wooden furniture in recent years. Alum Stone is especially abundant in Shandong. It is said that it was first discovered by Germans and then operated by the Japanese. When Qingdao was recovered, the mining rights of the mountain were also returned to the Chinese people. Patterned stone had to be bought from abroad. A few years ago, a Cantonese person named Tang went to Huzhou to mine stone and make stone powder. He unintentionally obtained a patterned stone mountain. Unfortunately, the color and pattern were not as bright and clear as foreign goods. Perhaps it was because it was mined from the surface. In the future, it may be better when excavated underground. The price is half that of foreign goods. The market price for rough pieces is five yuan per cubic foot. Polished stone, half an inch thick, costs two yuan per square foot. The Shanhai Marble Company on Edward Road in Shanghai is a mechanized manufacturer of this stone. Only this one in Shanghai is owned by Chinese people. Last year's business was worth over 300,000 yuan. The company also operates artificial stone business. However, many construction companies in Shanghai can make artificial stone recently. It has become a very common industry. No need to elaborate.</p>
<p>(Two) (Four) Cosmetic Factories</p>
<p>Our country has been famous for manufacturing cosmetics since ancient times. Reading the "Rhapsody on the Afang Palace," one can imagine the grandeur of Qin Palace's cosmetics. In modern material civilization, there are even more types of cosmetics manufactured. To list them all, there are almost three hundred kinds. There are countless cosmetic manufacturers in Shanghai. There are about eighty with trademarks and factories that can be investigated. However, the types of products they produce range from more than ten to seven or eight, and some only produce one or two. The amount of capital is not uniform because of the amount of products produced. The large ones have capital of over one million yuan, while the small ones only have dozens of yuan. Famous ones are Family, Guang Sheng, Yonghe, Xiangya and other factories. Famous products include Family Industrial Cooperative's Invincible Tooth Powder, Guang Sheng's Double Beauty Brand Flower Dew, China Chemical Industry's Samsung Brand Snow Powder, Yonghe Industrial Cooperative's Moonlight Goddess Brand Toothpaste, Sincere Company's Thousand Mile Fragrance, Meiya's Hair Beauty Lotion, Mainland's Elegant Box, China-France's Baby Face, China-West's Little Girl, and other Meixing Brand Fragrant Powder, Golden Bell Brand Hair Growth Oil, Banknote Brand Dusting Powder, Autumn Moon Brand Powder Puff, Student Brand Fragrant Honey, etc. There are many items. It is impossible to list them all. The total annual sales in this city are valued at 4 million yuan. The sales in other cities are 2 million yuan. According to the Customs Trade Register of 1910, foreign imports still amounted to more than 4.3 million yuan. The number is alarming. Now, if you manufacture cosmetics with small capital, you can still manufacture Snow Cream Vaseline, etc. Although tooth powder does not require much capital, you cannot make money without large-scale production and sales. The item of decoration is more important than Snow Cream. Only raw materials such as magnesium carbonate, talc, and peppermint extract can be purchased from domestically made goods. Since the release of domestically made tooth powder, the Japanese King Kong Lion Brand tooth powder has disappeared from the market. This can be said to be a success of resistance. It is gratifying.</p>
<h3>Recording the Sounds of Old Temple Bells (59)</h3>
<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu (Studio of Unweeded Courtyard)</p>
<p>Sixty-Six</p>
<p>The youths of the old temple have risen. Everyone has seen the one-year plan for children and seen the children actively following the plan. Not only do they feel a little itchy in their hearts, but even their hands are itching. As for myself, I am at the intersection of children and youth, but it is better to say that I am a youth than a child. I am holding a torch and burning everywhere. "Children have become a one-year plan, how can we youths lag behind?" Soon, the youths of the whole village held a meeting with great enthusiasm and passed the following one-year plan for the old temple youths: (1) Dig a well;</p>
<p>(2) Build a road to the city gate;</p>
<p>(3) Organize a youth afforestation association to establish a nursery, with each person planting at least 200 trees;</p>
<p>(4) Use new rice seeds to plant a field per person and try it out;</p>
<p>(5) Use new wheat seeds to plant a field per person and try it out;</p>
<p>(6) Learn a craft during the agricultural off-season, such as weaving cloth, weaving towels, weaving socks, etc., to increase production;</p>
<p>(7) Organize a youth martial arts club to learn twelve sets of boxing, and learn any one of knives, spears, swords, and sticks;</p>
<p>(8) Join the self-defense corps to complete the company training, practice field battles four times, and hit moving targets, with three consecutive shots hitting the target;</p>
<p>(9) Join the fly extermination team, mosquito extermination team, bed bug extermination team, and locust extermination team to cooperate with all the village children to eliminate pests in the entire village and nearby areas;</p>
<p>(10) Organize a cooperative;</p>
<p>(11) Organize a youth drama troupe to perform four times;</p>
<p>(12) Organize a youth concert, with each person learning one kind of musical instrument and five sets of songs;</p>
<p>(13) Recognize and use one thousand characters;</p>
<p>(14) Play fifty sets of scientific tricks and be able to explain the principles contained in each trick;</p>
<p>(15) Understand the movement of celestial bodies, day and night, the way of cold and heat, and the process of growth of one kind of plant and one kind of animal through observation in the field;</p>
<p>(16) Organize a youth newspaper and book club, with each person reading the newspaper every day and reading new books every month, and those who cannot read should learn quickly;</p>
<p>(17) Each person earns five yuan with their own labor for the purpose of recovering the three northeastern provinces;</p>
<p>(18) Voluntarily or nominate two or more people to join the volunteer army to recover the three northeastern provinces, with all the youths in the village jointly responsible for family support to avoid worries for the patriotic soldiers.</p>

<p>On Speech</p>
<h3>Zheng Xiaoxu Speaks on the Politics of Ruin</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>What Zheng Xiaoxu speaks of is originally a Japanized version of Kingly Way Politics, not the Politics of Ruin. In reality, how could Zheng Xiaoxu understand Kingly Way? How could he be worthy of speaking of Kingly Way? What he is worthy of speaking of is only the Politics of Ruin, as he is an experienced person who has personally been through it, so I call him as speaking on the Politics of Ruin.</p>
<p>The other day, a certain Qing loyalist returned from a visit to Puyi and described in detail how Puyi was being monitored by the Japanese in Changchun. He said that people call the Manchukuo a puppet government, but after my visit, I secretly fear that Xuantong is not even as good as a puppet, but is like Zhang Bangchang and the Emperors Huizong and Qinzong of the Song Dynasty. And Zheng Xiaoxu, like a gourd hanging without being eaten, is still giving lectures on his Kingly Way politics at the so-called Advanced Officials Training Center. It's truly a wonder that he can speak it out. That is why I say that Zheng Xiaoxu is only fit to speak of the Politics of Ruin, and not fit to speak of Kingly Way politics.</p>
<p>Puyi is called the Regent, but he is no different from a prisoner. Originally, he was not called Emperor but Regent, which was very meaningful. The "Zhi" in Regent originally meant "to seize," meaning to seize him and make him govern. Therefore, Puyi's every move and word is monitored by the Japanese. He has completely lost his freedom, like a student in a private school under the strict supervision of a stern teacher. Even when whispering privately with a classmate, he must look at the teacher's face. It is exactly the same. If he is not careful, the cane will follow. Puyi's current situation is like this. I wonder if he has realized it now? Is it more impressive than it was in Tianjin?</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoxu urged the old master to simmer sand pots and encouraged Puyi to restore the monarchy, wanting to enjoy the addiction of being a prime minister. Now you can think back and wonder what it tastes like. Originally, his mind was filled with old Chinese history from when the Han borrowed from the Xiongnu, the Tang borrowed from the Turks, and the Song borrowed from the Khitans. Now he wants to use it to deal with the current environment. It's truly foolish, truly a dream. Now that you have tasted the taste, please continue to speak on the Kingly Way politics, or please speak on the Politics of Ruin.</p>
<p>Therefore, I was reminded of what a friend told me the other day. He also came back from outside the Pass. One day, a certain Qing loyalist went to visit Puyi and said, "The Regent must consult on his own, and great power cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of others." These words were heard by Komai, who immediately had him summoned for questioning. The Qing loyalist explained his words, saying that the so-called great power that cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of others refers to the entire Manchuria and that it should not be intimidated by the power of the League of Nations and changed. He was then forgiven and allowed to leave. Another Qing loyalist went to visit Puyi, fell to the ground, wept, and said nothing. This was also heard by Komai, who had him summoned for questioning. The Qing loyalist said, "I am so grateful that I am moved to tears and have nothing to say. Without the help of your country, where would Xuantong be today?" Komai smiled slightly and told him to leave quickly.</p>
<p>When I saw this news, I sighed three times in anguish!</p>

<h3>Visiting the Bund Park</h3>
<p>— Song Fu</p>
<p>The ten-mile stretch of prosperity is foreign soil, a stroll in the park to enjoy the cool. Rolling waves churn up turbid tides, shady summer trees reflect weeping willows. Chinese and Western delicacies are arranged in abundance, clean white tablecloths are well-arranged. A continuous stream of tourists adds to the elegant atmosphere, with the coming and going of fan shadows and the rustling of clothing. Electric lights twinkle and add to the grand mood, the flowing music evokes passionate feelings. Here on the Bund, one can frequently gaze afar, one may as well indulge in wine and wander about drunkenly.</p>
<h3>Farmers Yearning for Rain</h3>
<p>Since summer began, it has been perpetually clear, farmers are tormented by the heat and feel distressed. No one in the suburbs is comforted by the hope of clouds and rainbows, in the three dog days they still ask for the blessing of rain. Let abundant sweet rain reward long-cherished wishes, generously bestow moisturizing dew and protect all living things. Building altars and setting up fasting services, the spirit of the gods protects, abstaining from killing and practicing vegetarianism, and following customary practices. Dragons appear in the rice paddies, a sign of good fortune, doves call on the willow banks, stirring joyous sounds. If Heaven truly follows the will of the people, the five grains will flourish and bring peace and prosperity.</p>

<h3>Methods of Making Black Pigments</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Black pigments such as lamp black, graphite, carbon black, drop black, etc., all contain a very high amount of carbon. They can be used to make agricultural and printing inks, paints, etc., and their uses are very wide. Their manufacturing methods are:</p>
<p>(1) Lamp Black: Place substances rich in carbon, such as oil, resin, coal black oil, ten-carbon dense cyclic matter, and sixteen-carbon dense cyclic matter, in a place with limited air and burn it to obtain lamp black. In fact, lamp black is soot, which on average contains 98 percent carbon. The quality is determined by the size of the powder.</p>
<p>(2) Graphite: Graphite is one of the carbon isomers. There are natural products produced in Sri Lanka, Siberia, Canada, the United States, etc. There are also man-made products. The method is to heat smokeless coal, bone charcoal or other amorphous carbon at high temperatures in an electric furnace with very little pressure to make artificial graphite. This is Acheson's Method. Both natural and artificial graphite contain impurities such as quartz, iron oxide, and alumina, but natural graphite contains more impurities and less carbon. Natural graphite contains about 60% carbon, while artificial graphite contains about 90% carbon.</p>
<p>(3) Carbon Black (i.e., Coal Gas Black) This pigment contains about 98 to 99 percent carbon. The method is to burn carbonaceous gases, such as natural gas or acetylene gas (C2H3), in a place with poor air circulation to obtain carbon black.</p>
<p>(4) Drop Black: This pigment includes Vine Black, Ivory Black, and Frankfort Black. Various raw materials, such as waste from ivory cutting, grape buds, cork cutoffs, coconut shells, etc., are heated in crucibles. The remaining residue in the crucible contains part of the raw materials, carbon, and minerals in the ash after burning. Most of the minerals are potassium salts, which can absorb moisture, so Drop Black must be rinsed and then dried. This pigment is extremely black. Compared with lamp black, lamp black becomes gray.</p>

<h3>Contributions to the Improvement of Men's Clothing</h3>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhang Cangsu's proposal to improve men's clothing, I am deeply moved. I am eager to contribute some of my views.</p>
<p>Among the four major elements of life, clothing is very important. Although our country's clothing has undergone thousands of changes, with endless innovations, the basic long robe and short jacket remain unchanged. Apart from the fashionable Western suits and leather shoes, the old habits continue. All the problems have been stated by Mr. Zhang, so there is no need to repeat them. Now we have an urgent need to improve, but just talking without concrete measures, and without a detailed plan and discussion by the majority of people on what improved clothing is considered satisfactory and practical, it will not succeed. Now I am writing down my personal views: (1) Suitable Clothing: Clothing should be suitable for the body. If the length is not suitable or the size is uneven, it will affect a person's spirit and the cleanliness of their appearance. (2) Elegant Appearance: The appearance of clothing can show the awakening and decline of the national spirit.</p>
<p>(3) Economy: Our country is being invaded by strong neighbors from abroad and exploited by traitors from within, resulting in the exhaustion of the people and wealth. Therefore, we must strive to save money in terms of clothing.</p>
<p>(4) Simplicity: Clothing must be simple and convenient, and should not be too complicated and clumsy, so as to avoid stagnation in travel and waste of time in dressing.</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, I think the long robe should be shortened and the short jacket lengthened. The style should imitate the student uniform, but the collar should refer to the Zhongshan suit style. The trouser legs should be narrow and lengthened. Because Western suits are too complicated and wasteful, student uniforms are relatively simple, but the arms are not flexible enough. Central clothing feels loose and clumsy, so we should take the strengths of others and make up for our own weaknesses. The short jacket is lengthened and the collar of the central clothing is easy to collapse, so it imitates the Zhongshan suit style. The hips of Western-style pants are easily broken, so it is not as economical as the Chinese style of swapping two sides. I hope that my humble work is appropriate, and I ask the experts for guidance. This is respectfully submitted to the Society Improvement Discussion Association. Sincerely by member Xu Nangong,</p>
<p>The style is as shown in the diagram below.</p>

<h3>New Student Enrollment</h3>
<p>— Manqian</p>
<p>This is the general situation for school new student enrollment:</p>
<p>When new students come to take the entrance exam, they are generally wearing a proper straw hat and a long summer cloth gown. In their hands, one is holding a folding fan, and the other is carrying a package of examination stationery wrapped in newspaper. This genteel appearance is completely different compared to their true colors after being admitted to the school!</p>
<p>The quota for enrollment is two hundred students, but in reality, only one hundred and four people have registered for the exam.</p>
<p>Each applicant pays two silver dollars as a registration fee; in such hot weather, it's embarrassing for the school principal to ask the teachers and staff to supervise the exam and grade the papers as a mandatory duty. The principal has no choice but to grit his teeth, reach into his pocket, sweeten the teachers' mouths, and treat them to watermelon soda and a few tables of food and wine. This is to prevent them from complaining in private!</p>
<p>The physical education instructor is always paying attention: are there any athletes applying? If you've stood out on the sports field, it doesn't matter if your exam results are not good; in the end, you will still be on the list!</p>
<p>The school principal is paying attention: in the appearance of new students, if someone is dressed in a suit and leather shoes, with a modern attire, then the principal fears that you might be active and cause disturbances. No matter how well you do on the exam, there is no hope of being admitted! On the other hand, if you are rustic and full of country air, then the principals will express their twelve points of welcome and sympathy!</p>
<p>The first test is mathematics. By the time of the second test, physics, thirteen people were gone. By the time of the final oral examination, only eighty-two people remained!</p>
<p>Those who submitted blank math papers accounted for one-third of the total. Another third, although they scribbled something randomly, the result was still the same as not doing anything. The remaining third was relatively good, but none of the scores exceeded sixty points! As a result of the new student exam, only one person passed the overall average score, barely reaching sixty points. Only four people scored above fifty points. Because of this, it was difficult to set the admission standard. After several discussions, it was finally decided that all those with an overall average of thirty points or above would be admitted. However, calculating this way, there were only thirty-seven people. In the end, three more were added with an overall average of twenty-eight points or above, making a total of forty people!</p>
<p>Because the number of pre-determined enrollment slots was not filled, they had no choice but to hold the second and third recruitment rounds as much as possible. Of course, the situation was the same as the first recruitment.</p>
<p>Family Matters</p>
<h3>Severing the Head</h3>
<p>— Shiben</p>
<p>Xu Laoer, nicknamed Little God of Wealth, who lived next door, died of plague last night. During his life, he was diligent and thrifty, accumulating assets worth one hundred thousand. Because he was a money-loving entrepreneur, he never enjoyed good food or clothing in his forty-plus years. He only knew how to buy fields and houses year after year, increasing his assets. He never spared a dime for local public welfare or charitable causes. People saw his lack of benevolence despite his wealth, so although they nicknamed him Little God of Wealth, they secretly called him a miser.</p>
<p>Although he accumulated a lot of wealth, he still worried about having no heir when he died. Because he was not yet fifty years old, he still hoped to marry a concubine and have children. Therefore, he immediately refused the clan's suggestion to establish an heir to inherit his estate. But heaven has unpredictable winds and clouds, and man has good and bad fortune. Before he could achieve his goal of marrying a concubine and having children, he lost his vast wealth and died.</p>
<p>His sudden death without having arranged matters after his natural lifespan caused a great dispute. After the news of his death spread, the clan's nephews and grandsons ran over in droves, rummaging through boxes and cabinets, seizing property deeds. Everyone was fighting and grabbing, desperately trying to collect property. They were all like living robbers. They ignored his corpse, which had been lying on the bed for a day. Only after all the cash savings had been completely plundered by these nephews and grandsons did they remember that real estate was the right of the heir. Then, everyone gathered around to take care of his funeral for the sake of the property.</p>
<p>According to local customs, holding the head when the body is placed in the coffin is the duty of the heir, and it is considered a necessary indication of who will inherit the estate. Therefore, for those who have biological sons, there is naturally no issue with holding the head after death. However, if there is no heir, then the issue of holding the head often becomes chaotic and tumultuous. Now, Xu Laoer is in this situation. Several nephews, you want to establish an heir, I want to inherit, causing endless disputes. The quarrels continued until Xu Laoer had been lying on the bed for three days and had not been resolved. However, the summer weather is hot, and how can a corpse be left for several days? So, by the third day, when his nephews' head-holding issue had not yet been resolved, his corpse had already fulfilled the saying "a dead man in June rots quickly."</p>
<p>By the afternoon of the fourth day, this major issue still had not been resolved. However, the general relatives and friends all complained to the nephews, "You can argue over the inheritance after the coffin is sealed. You shouldn't make things difficult for the deceased." The nephews listened and thought that prolonging the matter was not a good thing, especially since the weather was hot, and the stench was overwhelming. If they didn't proceed with the burial, wouldn't the body turn into bloody water? So, they agreed to the relatives' request and ordered the gravedigger to change Xu Laoer's hat. However, after all the procedures were completed, when the gravedigger was carrying the corpse from the bed to the coffin, the nephews were all afraid of not holding the head, and thus not being able to seize the inheritance. So, they all rushed forward like a swarm, grabbing Xu Laoer's skull. In the chaos of many hands grabbing, the already decomposed skull, grabbed by more than a dozen hands, with a "thump" sound, Xu Laoer's means of making a living was severed from his body under the violence of his nephews' grabbing and pulling.</p>
