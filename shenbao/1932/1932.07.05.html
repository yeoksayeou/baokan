<h3>華北風雲緊急之謠傳</h3>
<h3>彬</h3>
<p>邇日以來。華北形勢。突有緊急之謠傳。满洲僞國承受日本之嗾使。將大舉入寇關内之說。甚囂塵上。國人安居宴處。或早已置國難於腦後。更不知我國家正日向危殆之前途推進。設使華北而一旦禍作。則我國家前途。誠不知將伊於胡底。引領北望。吾人眞爲之徬徨無措。</p>
<p>自九一八至今。歷時九月。張學良旣持不抵抗主義。全師遁逃。坐使東三省全部陷落。政府復取不戰不守遷延苟安之態度。坐使满洲僞國。得以成立。日人在東北之軍事行動。得以充分準備。國人日作討伐僞國收復失地之呼籲。政府亦日作收回失地已有最大决心充分準備之宣言。然而時逾九月。國人之呼籲如故。政府之宣告亦如故。討伐僞國。收回失地。終未見有何準備。今僞國不待我討伐。且先準備入寇。政府養　貽患。自貽伊戚。誤國至此。更復何言。　　當東北禍發之初。吾人即早已斷言極日人之野心。决不以侵佔東北而止。東北可以侵佔。則平津亦無不可以襲取。在不抵抗主義之下。榆關天險。終可超度。平津雖好。終難必其可以高枕無憂。自犬養中刺。日法斯西運動激化以來。對華政策硬化。益爲日本輿論之中心。然而張學良高臥平津。日惟歌舞行樂。早置家國之仇於度外。中央亦徒日唱攘外必先安内。冷煞國人之情緒。剿匪可以調動大軍。而抗日何以不能抽調勁旅。剿匪可以「快做」「硬做」「實做。」而抗日何以遷延半載有餘。但有呼聲。終未見其實行。政府於此。誠不知更將何以自圓其說。</p>
<p>夫東北爲國家之領土。而非個人之私產也。張學良以負有守土專責之長官。外患之來。竟全師退讓。如言整飭紀綱。則課張以喪土誤國之罪。誰曰不宜。即不然嚴令整師出關。收回失地。將功抵罪。又誰曰不宜。然而中央則終始優容。且多方爲之庇護。國家紀網。掃地無存。而張則仍坐擁重兵。儼然華北之長雄。與言出兵抵抗。則視爲故意與彼爲難。欲以犧牲其實力。此種重視個人權利。忽視國家主權之行爲。眞令人百思莫解。今平津又有緊急之謠傳矣。徵之九一八禍變未發時之謠傳。則吾人不能謂日人必無窺取平津之暴舉。設使果一旦禍作。又設使張學良仍持不抵抗主義。中央其仍安然坐視者越人視秦人之肥　耶。</p>
<p>據汪精衛氏日前報告。謂關於國防。張將南來與蔣商酌。夫國危至此。東北淪亡。亦已九月。而言及國防。則猶有待於商酌。國是荒廢至此。斯眞爲亡國之現象。此種苟安之積習如不　除。舉國上下如再不能積極振作。則雖無日寇。我國前途。亦將不堪設想。</p>
<p>吾人認爲今日應一面積極援助東北艱苦奮鬥之義勇軍。一面嚴檄張學良嚴陣準備抵抗。如其不能。則不若明令撤懲。另調勁旅。鞏固國防。事急矣。殷鑒未遠。當局其速醒。</p>

<p>國民社三日莫斯科電　近日日本有侵入西比利亞之野心一說、甚囂塵上、而在蘇俄當局之觀察、覺美國之承認蘇俄、實爲惟一挽救危局之方、蓋美國之承認莫斯科政府、不論將採取何種形式、均足以使日本熱中之軍閥服一劑清凉散、惟蘇俄政府當局現尙未能將此種見解正式表白、因彼等固尙不願暴露其請求承認之痕跡也、再則倘蘇俄方面過於認眞希望他國之承認、在政治方面則爲不智、在大體方面則爲失却尊嚴、故寗暫守緘默、尤不願對於美國自身稍涉干涉之嫌疑云、惟在非正式方面某接近政府之俄人、曾謂蘇美結合、可使以「軍事放火者」望而却走云、此人復稱、「蘇俄之所以希望蘇美復交、並非因蘇俄無戰勝日本之自信力、蘇俄之確能戰勝日本、已屬毫無疑義、惟蘇俄深不願世界之多故、蓋俄國刻正竭力於和平之發展、苟戰事有避免之方、吾人無不樂從」云云、美俄復交之宣傳、爲日已久、在莫斯科方面之報紙雖無所評論、但知蘇俄方面對於此事、亦至關心、蘇俄領袖曾明白表示稱、蘇俄之態度、華府方面已洞悉無遺、今後惟視美國之一着棋如何下手耳、現俄國陸軍部機關紅旗報曾載一社論、警告日本勿輕舉妄動、並勸告日本勿恃强國之外援、以與蘇俄爲難、因外援恐難成事實也、該報之言係明指美國之援日而言、該報復謂即使外援可以取得、但援日者决不願以勝利之結果、任日本之享受云、末稱、「帝國主義之國家、或將用日本以制蘇俄、但至多不過欲用日本之爪、從火中攫取熟栗、日本豈能敵列强、列强亦豈願任日本爲所欲爲云、</p>
<h3>洛桑賠欵會議露新曙光</h3>

<p>法總揆赫禮歐星夜趕赴洛桑</p>
<p>國民社三日洛桑電　賠欵問題早日和平解决之希望、經今日各方努力斡旋結果、業已大爲光明、雖尙未能遽謂本日爲談判、轉險爲夷之日、但會議中人咸以爲業已覓得繼續談判基礎矣、此項基礎即係舊協約國最近修正之計劃、而於今午送交德總理巴本者、當英相麥唐納送交新計劃之前、曾與巴本作長談、德外長亦在座、會商畢、五大國代表復開會議、將新計畫加以最後修正、然後送交德方、此項新計畫將可稱爲麥唐納計劃、與法代表前所堅持者大異、内容規定德國繳付四十萬萬馬克、作爲取消賠欵之補償、此欵將由德國發行債票、利息五厘外加一厘爲基金、暫存國際清償銀行、俟三年停付期满、即可在國際市塲發行、但必須確知國際市塲有吸收此債能力時、始可出售、當此項計畫正式送交德總理後、德總理立提三項保留、（一）關於總額、（二）關於發行債票上、德國未有適宜担保一層、（三）關於成立賠欵與戰債連鎖之方式、英相麥唐納當即再召債權國會議、提出德國反對各點、加以討論、並聞英相曾認德國所爭辯者、内有數點確爲實情、債權國會議後、德總理巴本即將德國對案送出、迄於今夜仍在債權國研究中、現法德代表時以電話與本國政府商確、料今夜或將通宵談判、明日即可得一定議、</p>
<p>路透三日洛桑電　自賠欵會議担任調節戰債與賠欵大問題之艱苦工作以來、不知經過幾許討論會晤與談判、直至今日、始有結果景象、解决現已有望、但尙未逹到、德國對於列强某項提議之反對、現爲進行之障礙、但衆覺此種障礙當可打銷、蓋料德國之反對與答案、或不外乎冀獲讓步之作用也、英法意比日五强所擬之計畫、内有三點、爲德國所反對、（一）德國所須償付歐洲經濟善後金之數目、（二）發行所擬歐洲善後金債券之條件、（三）關於美國戰債之保障條文、德人現要求取銷凡爾賽和約關於賠欵之部份、而和約中之德國爲戰事罪魁一條、尤爲德國所反對、德國又要求歐洲經濟善後金債券之發行日期、須由國際清理銀行理事會全體同意决定之、不能取决於多數同意、德國復又要求加發行債券、則必對於德國市塲與德國債欵信用、有適當保障、德國對於德國應償付歐洲經濟善後金四十萬萬馬克一節、嫌其數目過鉅、要求减半、以上德國要求、或將引起重大反對、而法國方面尤難承認、惟據衆推測、德國之提出此項答案、不過希望續得利益而已、故料未必竟成僵局也、</p>

<h3>日本農村經濟窮乏之原因</h3>
<p>— 懷仁</p>
<p>東京通信一九二九年以後、世界經濟撳起了一個猛烈的波瀾、購買力的衰頽、物價的暴落、金的偏在現象、銀價的慘落、失業潮的高漲、在在都給與世界以一大脅威、這本來是必然的、從產業革命後漸漸抬頭的資本主義、已步入到了最後的階段、這些惡運命的遭遇、是屬「咎由自取」、｜在過去很久、已種下了許多的因、今日惡現象的叢生、不過是結果的爆發而已、</p>
<p>這世界不景氣的狂潮、已彌漫了全球（除蘇俄一國）、戰前繁榮的歐洲經濟、在今日祇剩餘下奄奄待斃的一息、資本王國的美利堅、已深深地感到了生產過剩的煩惱、中國受了銀價慘跌的近因、週身已是百孔千瘡、其餘一切一切的國家、也一樣的感覺到自體的動搖了、過去美國的銀價救濟策、胡佛的戰債延期案、多惱河畔的經濟會議、最近洛桑的賠欵會議、未來的世界經濟會議、誰不是想在這不景氣深淵中拯救起自已呢、然而在今日的世界中、充满着了矛盾的現象、資本主義與非資本主義的矛盾、有產與無產的矛盾、甲國與乙國的矛盾、宗主國與殖民地的矛盾、從這樣衆多的矛盾中去恢復景氣、結果是祇有失望、因此幾年來世界經濟的恐慌、依然是殘留着、世界的危機、依然是展開着、</p>
<p>太平洋西岸的日本、自明治維新以後、經過了世界第一次大戰的良機、已走入了極典型的資本主義之路、在這世界經濟恐慌的年頭、資本主義漸趨於窮迫的時期中、日本當然不能例外、｜購買力減退、物價下落、生產緊縮：：經濟界起了極大的狂瀾、在這裏最表面化的、是日本農村經濟的窮迫、百工不得一飽的日本農民階級、寄生於資本主義機械之下、在過去景氣繁榮的時代、已是深深的感到了重重榨取的困苦、所以在今日資本主義經濟恐慌之下、農村的更形增加窮迫、當然不是一種偶然突發的事變、</p>
<p>今日日本的農民、一方面受了農產品價格下落的直接影響陷入於收入銳減的悲運中、另一方面、因了高利借欵的運用、已墜入了被剝削被宰割的慘狀中、據最近的統計、平均每户農民、負擔着七八百圓的借欵、而收入所得、不唯不能清償債務、即生活都不足以維持、在這種環境之下、農民不得不做出種種下策來、據去年十一月的調查、山形縣最上郡西小國村、四百六十七名的十五歲以上二十四歲未满的年青姑娘中、有百五十名供人做傭女、還有百十名是渡着娼妓的生涯、（占全數中百分之二十三）這樣遠離了家庭而出賣肉體所得的代價、都移作清償高利借欵之用了、</p>
<p>讓我們先考察一下日本農村經濟窮迫的原因、這裏應該先提出的第一點原因、是日本過去經濟政策的錯誤、由來日本的兩大政黨、｜民政與政友｜牠們是由三菱和三井兩財閥抱腰、因此在過去的政黨政治、可說是一種都會中心的行政、這種行政制度下的經濟政策、不消說以商工業及都市的繁榮與便利爲目的、至於農業和農村、它們是等閒視之、過去十年二十年間、農業者公課公租的負擔、往往超出於有同額所得的商工業者之兩倍、洎乎最近、恐已在三倍或四倍之上了、農業者肩着這樣重的負擔、而所得的權利又怎樣呢、金融集中於都市、享受到便宜的是企業家而不是農業者、學校·醫院等公共設備、置辦於都市中、化了極少的代價而能享受其利的、是市民而非遠居郊外的農業者、這樣都會中心行政的積弊、就造成了今日日本農村經濟窮迫的遠因、雖然、農村在某個時期、也曾受過政府的恩惠｜低利貸金的融通、但實際上小民是並未受過、所能得到低利貸金之利益的、是地主階級而已、</p>
<p>日本農村經濟窮迫的第二點原因、是兩三年來農產物價格的大崩落、七塊錢的一頭小猪、加上了十二塊錢的飼料、長大了還賣不到八塊錢、二十塊錢一擔的穀子、加上肥料、加上勞力、結果祇能賣得二十二塊錢、米·繭·野菜·鷄卵·乳肉·等一切農產品價格都下落、於是農家的收入、即因而大減、平均每年每一農家的販賣額減少、大致在百圓以上、一般平日收入不豐的農家、其減收額竟有超過百圓之二三倍者、換言之、即每農家當減收二分之一或三分之二的所得、農家收入的銳減、很急速的直接的造成了農村經濟極度的窮迫、</p>
<p>此外、農業經營的單營化、是日本一部分地方農村經濟窮迫的第三點原因、農業經營的單營化、在好景氣時代、當然不致發生何種困難的問題、但一旦在不景氣的年頭、農家生活上就不得不因缺乏彈力性而窮乏、譬如日本有些生產生絲的地方、牠唯一的農業經營是「春蠶」、因此在絲價狂落的時候、牠没有辦法來改營稻作或其他的農作、而這地方的農村經濟、遂陷入於窮乏的境地了、</p>
<p>去年日本東北及北海道的凶作、也是日本最近農村經濟窮迫的一近因、「山雨欲來風满樓」、這樣重重疊疊的原因之下、日本農村經濟的破產和　落、似乎已是不可苟避的了、</p>
<h3>東京雜訊</h3>

<p>满鐵總裁尙有問題　東京時事新報云、内田總　行將就任外務大臣、政府對是後任總裁之人選、以八田副總裁昇任說爲最有力、但因八田屬於政友會、色彩濃厚、故　井拓相反對甚力、且謂满鐵係帝國之生命線大動脈、假令新統制機關實現、總裁一席、仍須以大臣級之人物中選任爲宜云云、蓋日自倡議满蒙四頭政治統制後、满鐵附屬地行政、當然劃出獨立、满鐵僅成爲一純粹的鐵道公司、故此满鐵總裁之權限勢必縮小、而遂有廢止從前大臣級之議也、</p>
<p>大阪火車忽遭槍擊　大阪每日新聞云、前月二十八日午後八時、由大阪開赴東京之特别快車、行經大阪站附近北野通路交又點時、突然由鐵道東側連發數槍、彈中二等車之中央車窗、一時乘客驚惶失措、惟無負傷者、旋由曾根崎警署派警四出搜查、而犯人已遠逸、尙難判明眞相出、</p>

<p>（一）現存東鐵總工廠各種車輛、總材料廠所存材料、及沿線各站車輛材料、統由各該管區警負責保護、必要時、派警監視、若車輛運出、或搬運材料、須請由路警處許可、由處令調查局審查、如果理由正當、方准發車、否則制止運行、</p>
<p>（二）經調查局證明車輛向他站運送、應由發車站路警、記明車輛號碼種類、報告本處、由處通知到逹站、以資保護、而防外運、</p>
<p>（三）各站運送所用車輛、須由各站路警及該站調查員調查許可、如有不正當之行爲、不准發車、</p>

<p>（六）本辦法以保護鐵路財產爲目的、責任重大、各站路警官員不得京於職務、否則依法處置、</p>
<p>日人對於中東路的陰謀、揚言預備收買俄國股權、否則亦須用委託代管的名義、改爲北满鐵路、但俄人以爲放棄中東路、於　異放棄太平洋、所以日軍凱旋車的爆炸、竟出於俄軍部的命令、似此相激相盪、北满終有再成戰場的一日、不過俄人在不危害其生命以前、目前似預備放任一切、就是與傀儡國虚與委蛇、亦所不辭、近日日人宣傳傀儡國將於七月間、關於中東路問題、與俄國在哈爾濱開會討論、也許是事出有因罷、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯语录</p>
<h3>家花變成野花</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>一八七二年是申報誕生的一年，那時，世界學風正在大轉變的時候。逹爾文的「物種原始」早已在一八五年年出版。其時，日本從德國回來的留學生銳意摹仿西洋，設文部省，釐定學制，正是明治維新的開端。當時，日本人摹仿西洋，也很盲目，喜歡新奇而不務實際，好奇之徒對於逹爾文的著作、見獵心喜，就翻譯過來，大大的鼓吹。嚴又陵先生也翻了一部赫胥黎著的「天演論」，赫胥黎可算是和逹爾文同調。嚴又陵舞其生花之筆，將「天演論」翻得活像佛經一般的文字，惹起一般人盲目的崇拜。其實「天演論」三字翻得已經錯誤、因爲如果眞的「天」演，冥冥中自有造物主宰，與所謂機械的進化論定全相反了。</p>
<p>根據進化論的道理，物種由劣而良，由　而精。但是家花没有人栽培，爲什麽要變成野花？在這裏祇見「退化」而未見「進化」，所以「進化論」三字也有錯誤，應該譯做「演化論」。但就算是「演化」，也决不是生物自已能主宰。生物之生長和衰落，决不能超出本性以外，而移花接木，野花變成家花，都是人工所促成的，而不是本性的演化。</p>
<h3>發揮螞蟻的精神</h3>
<p>— 呂鳳子</p>
<p>海上圑體林立。或爲學問之研討。或爲感情之聯絡。宗旨相類。千篇一律。無足記述。不侫近參與一會。深覺生面别開。爰以介紹於讀者。</p>
<p>一日友人函招茶聚。至則濟濟蹌蹌。裙履雜沓。俱爲素眛平生。未曾一面者。友人一一介紹。新聞記者也。醫師也。畫師也。敎育家也。文學家也。形形色色。不一而足。而摩登式之女郎少婦。則皆係社友之夫人情侶或密友也。不侫初思友非素封。平日交際不廣。今集此盛大之茶會。不無狐疑。會開。始恍然非吾友所獨召。僅數人中之一人耳。蓋吾所列席者。非吾友個人之茶會。而係一個圑體之集會也。圑體中初僅數人。以晤會非易。乃由各人輪流按月召集。藉以聚談。其後輾轉介紹。今則逹五六十人。成績斐然矣。社有規異於其他圑體。凡爲社友。其配偶不論已婚未婚。每會均須偕至。一也。輪値者不限一人。費用則定數額。不許超越。以防浪費。二也。會無定址。舉行之地。不得相同。三也。他如每會必須有餘興。而必須與會者皆參與。故熱烈歡樂。得未曾有。其社章有云。改良社交。謀人生修養。使社友受圑體的陶冶。以促新社會之實現。現其措施。殊覺名實相符也。</p>
<p>友人言。該社事業。不僅如此。而於文化運動。尤爲努力。社有信用流通圖書館。以通信方法。無條件公開出借於讀者。手續費。保證金之類。均不收取。完全以讀者之人格信用爲保障。故爲各地青年所稱便。而亦全國所未有之圖書館也。近正籌以騾車小輪。載書以向農村。謀文化之普及。亦我國首創之事業也。社之名曰「蟻」。社友之行動。均能如蟻。蓋社有口號曰。『發揮螞蟻的精神』。社友咸能實踐焉。</p>
<p>不侫雖尙係初次參與該會。而印象至深。深覺該社不僅以社交調劑吾人枯燥之生活。尤能别闢蹊徑。努力文化。不落他人窠臼。殊爲難能可貴。故表而出之。</p>

<h3>大膽</h3>
<p>— 鑄</p>
<p>蘇州大陸銀行行長許劍青氏。因不治奇疾。溘然長逝於天賜莊博習醫院。緣氏自掌大陸以還。營業日盛。經濟手腕。殊足令人敬佩。不料因此積勞成疾。臥病不起。綿惙床褥者數月。當斯疾初起時。四肢俱黃。不數時竟黃遍全身。當時家族即斷爲黃疸病。車送博習醫院診治。該院以學術上之關係。須用愛克斯光鏡一照。始能斷定爲何病。距知照後結果。謂許氏之膽。竟超出常人九倍之大。一時傅說紛紜。以爲空前奇事。該院已有數十年之歷史。各種醫學常識。瞭若指掌。所遇奇異病狀。亦不亞數十次。許氏此疾。竟謂從未見過。其奇異可以想見。於是大膽許劍青之笑話。又傳遍城廂内外矣。（却酬）</p>
<h3>談塘棲枇杷</h3>
<p>— 厂</p>
<p>塘棲。界於杭縣德清間。廣產枇杷。每届枇杷上市之際。平津寗滬。以及其它各大都市。咸來採辦。良以枇杷產生最富之區。當推該處。有人統計。塘棲每年所產枇杷之總額。約値百數十萬之巨。塘棲枇杷。約分四種。一曰白沙。白沙又分軟條與硬條二種。軟條者。柄條較軟。實不甚大。形圓而略長。皮色淡黃而有斑點。肉白而帶微綠。核小而少。富漿液。剝食時。淋漓指間。味如蜜而鮮。又有一特色。即皮甚薄。剝之能自捲。而塘棲所產之枇杷。以此爲最佳。惟產額甚少。每年所產者。悉爲近地富室預定。用以投贈。因之雖當地市上。亦罕有出售。至各處市上所售之白沙枇杷。悉屬硬條。硬條次於軟條。實大形圓。核甚多。故有大頭白沙之名。味鮮甜而略酸。皮肉之色。均同軟條。汁亦富。產量較多。故能銷行各處。二曰紅種。又稱大紅袍。皮與肉。均紅黃。實大形圓、核多肉薄。味甘而淡。汁甚少。人因其實大色紅。形式美觀。故多喜之。實則徒具形式。識者不取。三曰楊墩。（因沙得名）實較它種爲小。形長圓。一枚一核。汁多味鮮甜。食之頗適口。惟出產不多。蓋產區僅楊墩（邨落）一處耳。四曰草種。形體大小不一。皮色青黃。味酸者爲多。產額特富。市上所售者。類皆此種。　　上述之白軟條白沙。其肉色之白。漿液之多。滋味之甜。一如鮮荔。顧其味甜而且鮮。此爲鮮荔所不及。故軟條白沙。不特爲枇杷中之最佳者。抑亦果類中之珍品也。至於紅種。徒有其名。非但遠遜白沙。抑且不逮楊墩。特稍勝草種耳。而楊墩種甚佳。除軟條白沙外。當推此種。祇以皮色若草種。形體又細小。故不爲人注意耳。</p>
<h3>世界女航空家的發逹史（三）</h3>
<p>— 曙山</p>
<p>女子而爲航空家的才能，試就「女性之飛騰」一書｜是德國的｜六個空中女王的生活紀錄｜中看來，可窺見其一斑。這本書是德國該蒂和秀脫克斯二氏合編而成的，據他們在序中說，女子從一百五十年前起，已與航空界有明白的關係了。</p>
<p>當孟特哥爾菲哀氏兄弟，初以汽球征空時，就引動了許多婦女爭看他們在巴黎的上空飛行，並有許多勇敢的女子都要求搭乘。到了結果，終於答應了二三女交際家的要求，把伊們帶入雲端。其中一個，且於一七八四年六月四日，逹到了二、七○○米之高度，惟其航行的時間只不過有四十五分鐘。到了一七八五年，據說有一個才十四歲的少女，乘着飛機翔翔於空中的世界。</p>
<p>後來到一八五○年，在有空中旅行之經騐的五百個歐羅巴人中，約有一成（卽四十九個）是女性。｜支國籍分：英國的是二十八人；法國的是十七人；德國的是三人；其餘的一個是意大利人。</p>
<p>但是一旦離開這人慾橫流而百般可惱的塵世，究有怎樣的愉快可言呢？這看在那個時候，有爲近代上流航空家的先驅者的蒂倍爾夫人所說：「進向莊嚴沈默和永遠和平的空中的世界，在昇騰的時候可說甚麽都满足了吧。在此崇高的寂靜裏面，想忘記了地球的表面，是何等的容易喲！當我相信和地面上的人們毫無關係的時候，同時覺得自已是永遠不滅的東西，眞是怎樣的愉快啊。所謂下界，在我們已老早的全不存在了。因爲當天氣極其穏靜而明朗之時，尙有厚厚的雲層把我們和下界隔開來。」</p>
<h3>古廟敲鐘錄（四三）</h3>
<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>四十七　　商商議曁畢，我就去到村裏召集村民大會。鐘一敲就來了一百五六十人。春生哥被推爲主席。今次開會有兩件事是我們没有想到的。一是王二嫂子提議女人也得學習武藝。她的力氣本來很大也會兩手拳。王二哥不是她的對手。聽見我們談到劍隊，矛隊，她也要提議組織鐮刀隊，鋤頭隊。宋老太並說：『女子歷來受男子保護，這是女子最大的恥辱。平日女子無力保護自已，受盡男人的氣：一旦有事，不被俘虜便受强姦，絲毫不能抵抗，等到清白點污，只得上吊跳塘。這都是女子没有把武力拿在自已的手裏閙出來的亂子。當然我們女子學會了武力，决不是和自已的男子比武。我們一定要槍口向外，不能專在房裏打老公，閙得隔壁隣居不能睡覺。總之，我們古廟有的是木蘭女，若是娘子軍不能成立，未免可惜。』我們聽了這番大道理，當然是贊成女子加入軍事訓練了。二是宋老太提議組織紅十字會，訓練止血，消毒，包裏，抬人，人工呼吸等等緊急救人法。這次大家抱着少說話多做事的目的討論問題，議决下列六大要案：</p>
<p>一本村男子在二十歲以上，四十歲以下應一律受軍事訓練。有病者應分别延緩或免受。</p>
<p>二本村女子願受軍事訓練者聽其自由投効，不加强迫。　　三本村軍事訓練包含散手拳，劍術，矛術，石鎖，鐵槓，槍法，排敎練，連敎練，營敎練，以及種種新戰術。</p>
<p>四本村應組織救護隊，挑選合格者訓練充任。</p>
<p>五公舉黃春生爲圑長，朱平，江忠，張飛虎爲敎練員，鐘兒爲助敎，李錐，趙小二哥，孫老五，錢老三，王二嫂子爲排長，宋老太爲救護隊長。</p>
<p>六平時每天訓練一時，農忙暫停，閑月增爲二小時。宋老太被推去請她的親戚呂醫士來指導救護工作。我被推去敦請張飛虎師傅來敎國術。散會後朱先生和江營長便開始組織。我乃翻過萬松嶺去請張師傳。他願來嗎？這重要的使命可不能失敗呀！</p>

<h3>銀爐烊化老幣</h3>
<p>近以洋厘低跌至原質幣制成分之下、故銀爐方面、以爲有利可圖、乃乘時崛起、紛紛收購英洋及大清銀幣、與夫廣東·江南·湖北等老幣·均以照市加水而購入者、上爐烊化、提取銀質、改鑄絞銀、每日均有大批數額上爐、因之市上對於此種英洋老幣、類率收羅殆盡、</p>
<h3>證券債價較上月稍漲</h3>
<p>市况寥落成交僅二百四十餘萬華商證券交易所復行開市、雖市塲經多日停市、但市上人氣、仍見毫無起色、前後市買賣交易遠不及前、計期貨交易上午尙有一百七十萬元、後市則祗七十餘萬元、合計二百四十五萬元、内除統鹽稅各計四五十萬元、其他多僅在二十萬元左右、整六關稅九六各僅數萬元、現貨交易共六萬五千元、中二○關二萬四千元、二○捲統稅各一萬、餘均僅數千元、至各債趨勢、以時局情况沉悶、大户態度冷淡、求供較前爲</p>
<p>平、趨勢遂極呆定、前後市盤旋甚微、僅以市上零户收進較多、比上月底多稍漲、惟除裁兵現貨及鹽稅八月期漲較鉅、其他祇好六七角左右、又下表各債券現貨係除上期本息計算云、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市飘忽不定</h3>
<p>棉紗市情趨勢異常紊亂、升降不定、以邇來市塲上成交數太旺、投機家心思促摸不定、變化迅速因之市况雜亂無章、棉紗本身上仍平疲、因國内社會經濟破產、人民日益貧　、内地銷路頗寂、無錫紗仍來申銷售、兼之日商在四處競售、賣價尤廉、幸華南一帶愛國心熱、在滬紛紛採辦華紗、包額殊巨、約有一萬包之巨、據一部份云、内中大半亦含投機性質、至於標紗漲時有廠商套出、午後英廠開出廿支五福牧羊紗一萬包、市盤遂跌云、</p>
<p>人標大體平疲　人標前市開盤、以美棉上漲、開盤買氣濃烈、各月漲一兩外、但有紗廠套出而跌、結果各月仍漲一兩二錢至六·七錢、午後英廠開出大批棉紗、套下市盤、又跌一兩一錢至八·九·錢、全日成交統計五萬三千四百包、查賣出裕大一千○五千包、逹記八百五十包、同興一千六百五十包、長豐二千包、大孚一千包、裕康一千包、買進榮興二千二百包、瑞大一千四百包、長豐三千六百包、兹將收盤價分列如下、人標　收盤　　漲跌存賬數　　十月一四三七跌　五　七三、三五０七月　一四二五漲一　一八、三００　十一月一四三七　四　七六、一００八月　一四二三　一　四二、八００　十二月一四四０　二　三五、九五０九月　一四三五跌四　五六、五五０總計　　　二０五、一００</p>

<h3>棉市氣象仍昂</h3>
<p>棉市晨漲午平、趨勢仍昂、因美棉虫害消息仍嚴重、而金市堅挺、所以新買户尙多、拉力尤强、故市氣較紗市爲硬、然各廠實需依然岑寂、棉市前途、仍依美棉爲伸縮也、查市塲上人心多數觀高、買方做多之念極其濃烈、但某巨商遂漲時抛出云、</p>
<p>鄭標時有起落　鄭標前市開盤、以美棉又漲、加之上日人心堅挺、各月漲二·三·四錢、二三盤驟變而落、但多頭仍購進加碼、午後有一部份多頭了結、跌三錢、二三盤散户及大户仍進又漲、結果平平、全日成交統計十一萬○五百擔、查賣出昶記三千一百擔、長和六千三百擔、長豐三千四百擔、買進吉豐二千一百擔、穗隆三千擔、瑞大二千四百擔、愼記二千六百擔、長豐二千擔、兹將收盤價分列如下、鄭標　收盤漲跌　　存賬　十一　三一００漲０三一七二、九００七月　三０五０　：：：五六、三００十二　三一三０　三０　九七、六００八月　三０九五漲０五　一０八、六００總計　　五九二、九００十月　三一００　一０　一六二、五００</p>

<h3>上週印棉市趨堅挺</h3>
<p>上週市况堅定、本地人心因棉區缺雨、頗形挺秀、其後美棉又有不利消息、益加堅昂、日本無需要、現貨購買極少、目下匯率雖不利於日商購買印棉、然預料日本疋頭必能增加進口、歐洲運出之棉、均解月底之額、本地廠家購買現貨、因之棉商、態度堅定、孟買到貨不多、上印度形勢堅秀、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）　　　　　　　　　　一九三一年　一九三二年九月一日起收數累計　二、二三七　一、九三二週末現存　　　　　　八六０　　　八五九九月一日起出口累計　二、一四三　八三一　　　輸往歐洲　　　　　五五０　一二五　　　輸往中國　　　　　一六七　一九八　　　输往日本　　　　　一、二０二　四七三　　　其他各地　　　　　二四　　　　三五</p>
<h3>糧食米市日見鬆動</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來船約抵二十號、浦存有限、城鄉店銷乃被前日開價過短、且邇來漲夙驟速、似乎不願此種市景、令人莫測、然祇申地習慣、兼之天官轉暖、銀根欠鬆、是以胃口頓覺呆弱、成交與昨尤遜、而售方觀此銷細、且貨難擱、厚粳行情忽跌二角、薄稻貨雖不多、但去胃則零星、開價亦短角外、蘆洋尖貨稀胃細、市居平庸、　　滬北　昨日河下來船十念號、去北不暢、常錫頂貨與崑山宜興米步步下游、頂軟一角、次疲二角、早晚稻跌風轉靜、開盤各短一尺、變元銷路尙佳、市面難鬆、蘆洋尖市銷平淡、内地來源凋零、積貨略少、行情平穏、</p>
<h3>洋米銷淡轉軟</h3>
<p>昨日洋米客化轉淡、統市祇上午有鎭江帮在市購買小絞千包、其他客户均無整票購買、本街鄉莊仍有問津、但胃口亦不及日前之旺、統市售開新小絞四千三百包、價九元九角二分至九元七角、陳小絞三百包、價九元五角半至九元半、一號西貢米一千包、價十一元三角　十一元二角、其他均無成交、惟滬上存米經上週中旺銷之後、又有自已裝運出口、故存底已减少四分之一、後首定貨已斷、定而未到者亦祇五十萬包左右、故市面或可站住云、</p>
<h3>粉市堅漲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、忽呈猛烈之漲風、以洋麥報價、雖無上落、惟以天時之不佳、及日本之水災、兼以裝津之水脚、已傳低减此後去化、必可見旺、金價亦復高十餘兩、此種情形、皆爲致漲之起因、而實銷方面、如天津帮陸續成交現粉十餘萬包、聞兵船計十一萬、紅藍車砲台麥根雙馬等牌、合計四萬餘包直裝天津、仍一兩九錢廠盤、故人心激昂業内外之買氣、極形熱閙、惟一部分廠家、則陸續出檔、故至收盤、遂稍回軟、觀後步如北帮仍動、一時當可站住也、結果本月份較前週末漲三分八月份漲三分半、九十月份漲三分二釐半、十一十二月份漲二分半云、</p>
<h3>期麥求多供少</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下市開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈堅昂之態、以洋埠雖無上落惟内帮客户、因各處水災重見、價又在最低檔口、有此原因、空户轉稀、買户則頗暢旺一般空户、則亦緣此</p>
<p>抵補、至一時多求供少、市氣旣佳價亦高昂、結果本月份較前週漲六分、八九月份漲五分、十月份漲三分、十一月份漲五分、現麥市面、仍趨活絡、廠胃亦頗佳、開霍家喬麥二兩八錢、次至七錢六分、唯亭麥二兩八錢二分、太倉麥二兩八錢四分、次至八錢、蓬萊麥二兩七錢半、沙頭麥二兩八錢半、崑山麥二兩八錢一分、安亭麥二兩七錢八分、共計四千餘包云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白劃市步漲</h3>
<p>水花青開盤甚俏昨日糖市公會市塲劃盤、交易頗盛、人氣以外</p>
<p>匯轉緊、更形見佳、是以需要愈旺、出户反稀、市價逐步上升、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價自十四兩四錢、高貨十四兩四錢半、後市喊高十四兩五錢、香港貨十四兩一錢七分半至二錢交易殊盛、賣方扳十四兩二錢半、趨勢均見挺秀、太古糖交易依然零落、Ｂ嘜劃十六兩二錢ＣＷ嘜十五兩八錢ＤＹ嘜十五兩五錢半、ＨＸ嘜十五兩三錢、Ｈ嘜十二兩四錢ＰＸ嘜十一兩二錢、Ｏ嘜十兩零七錢、市象較前堅俏、本廠水花青振記振新工廠、各有售開、價升至十一兩五錢、要手頗暢、市形殊覺俏秀、</p>
<h3>絲茶杭屬夏繭產歉質劣</h3>
<p>價小無人收買：：自繅土絲者多　　杭屬臨平等處、今歲農民春繭莫不備受虧蝕、經濟益緊、夏蠶無意飼育、祇餘葉之家、孵育改良種奈天時依然不正、繭產奇歉、祇及往歲一二成、且繭身薄次、鮮繭無人問訊、卽當地土絲行亦無進胃、繭價祇開十餘元、尙無受主、蠶户祇得自行烘焙、自繅土絲云、</p>
<h3>針眉綠茶銷暢價堅</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、路莊平水等路之針眉綠茶、英莊怡和天裕錦隆同孚各行、均起動辦、交易頗形旺盛、售價亦較前堅漲二三兩、屯溪遂安歙縣等路珍眉、行家頗多談判、但人心一致向上、索價較　、故交易未能十分見旺、　源高莊貢熙、印莊銷胃、業已發動、昨由富林洋行、開出義芳永牌、價一百十五兩、爲近來未有之高價云、</p>
<h3>疋頭客帮暢辦駱駝絨</h3>
<p>寛緊駱駝絨、業已上市開價、客帮如川北諸申莊咸皆下手採辦、蓋其路途較遠、運輸費時、故不得不預早採辦也、國貨駝絨較外貨爲暢銷、因其交貨迅速、可以選擇花樣而定織之、昨榮泰·德記條子寛緊駱駝絨躉批每碼修元二兩五錢七分半、緯綸·天翔·維一·先逹·勝逹·鴻發·茂業·逹昌·大中國·大逹·華東·統一·大南等國貨、一律售二兩一錢半、互色一兩八錢、其間尤以老虎圖·仙鶴圖二牌更形旺銷、因其質地經穿耳、</p>
<h3>五金英白鐵售盤回挺</h3>
<p>英白鐵自庚子賠欵委員會有現貨售出後、市上標準大受打擊、惟實銷不起、客路不動、致市象十分萎靡、近幾日來各同業爲血本攸關、相繼有維持之心、故在公會討論加價、因此市上空氣轉、好、是以標準亦帶高三分至數錢不一、現市七尺每張售八錢八分半、六尺每張七錢九分、二十八號每打估十一兩二錢半、二十六號十兩零五錢、二十四號九兩七錢半、聞昨市開出三四百打、查係北路客帮辦去較多云、</p>
<h3>薄馬口鐵盤價跌落兩餘</h3>
<p>三十五磅薄馬口鐵、爲香烟廠餅乾公司等之切需品、前因貨少需旺、標準提加二三兩不等、計最高價估至四十三兩五錢、近數日來到貨甚旺、而實銷反呆、故標準昨已跌落一兩、計每箱售四十一兩、而尙少受主云、</p>

<p>軍艦停泊　出雲軍艦開進浦江之後、經左近司中將指定該艦停泊地方、係在上次野村乘座時之日領署前、惟近爲日清公司之長江船、須到該處靠泊、故令出雲艦暫抛日清碼頭前江面之河筒上、滬上日本僑民、已預備六號下午七時、假虹口日本俱樂部設宴歡迎、由米里·太田等代表居留民公宴、</p>
<h3>俞鴻鈞今日訪克寗瀚</h3>
<p>徵詢對於Ｄ區日軍意見Ｄ區暫駐區域·曁公大·豐田·華豐·各紗廠、同文書院等所駐日軍、逾期延不撤退、經我方共同委員俞鴻鈞屢向日方委員岡崎、嚴厲交涉、除同文書院少數日軍、已經撤退、其餘Ｄ區及各紗廠、仍一再推諉、游移其詞、日前俞氏因日方無誠意表示、故用書面報告其同委員會主席委員克寗瀚、日方岡崎、旋於當日語俞氏、謂該區日軍、已準備撤退、復於翌日用電話約俞氏報告、該項日軍、已在準備撤退中、但始終無確期表示、故俞氏候至昨日、日方仍無確切消息、認爲日方全無撤退誠意、已决定於今日、往訪共同委員主席委員克銀漢、報告中日雙方交涉經過、及日軍一再推諉、延不撤退之情形、並徵詢共同委員會之意見、促轉向日方交涉云、又據日日社記者、探悉日方消息、日方對Ｄ區及各紗廠暫駐日軍之推諉不撤、其用意係在靜候我方與工部局之收回越界築路案之結果、因Ｄ區係包括越界築路之範圍中、現在我方與工部局方面之越界築路交涉、將次具體化、日人决定如越界築路經我方順利收回、則將作露骨之表示、非僅長駐不撤該Ｄ區之日軍、且有增調陸戰隊之準備云、</p>
<h3>收回越界築路案前途未可樂觀</h3>
<p>上海公共租界越界築路案、昨日所得消息如次、</p>
<p>工部局特别會未定　據工部局秘書處消息、原定於明日改開特别董事會、專門討論越界築路問題、因草案中所餘未定之各點、雙方意見、尙未一致、以致明日常會、是否改開特别會、現尙未定、大約須待臨時宣布、同時該案是否於是日提出討論、亦未决定、</p>
<p>西人揣測日人態度據西人傳日本反對解决越界築路案之最大原因、厥爲一二八之閘北戰事所促成、蓋淞滬戰事、日本師出無名、而結果又一無所得、在昔日兵尙盤踞於越界築路之北四川路一帶、今一旦越界築路案實行解决、則日本根據停戰恊定所允許之界外各馬路、且不可駐屯、是以在顏面上觀之、日本之出兵上海、非特一無所得、卽越界築路之駐兵、亦不可得、爲對付國内起見、不得不堅絶反對、我國政府、當可洞悉其隠、予以堅拒也、</p>
<p>日僑昨發反對宣言　時聞社云、關於收回越界築路問題、旅滬日僑、因該項草約、工部局主面有予以通過之可能、故反對益形明顯、前日日僑兩大圑體、（居留民會及各路商聯會）在文監師路日本人俱樂部、召集緊急聯席會議時、日領村井·工部局日董寺井·岡本·亦均被邀列席、參與會議、結果、除面促岡本·寺井·於出席工部局特别會議時、極力表示反對外、並以居留民圑體及各路商聯會名義、發表鄭重反對宣言、全文甚長、辭多荒謬、對於工部局</p>
<p>之放棄越界築路權、更爲深表不满、兹譯錄如下、支那政府收回上海工部局越界築路、已由準備時期而入於實行時期、其條約草案、經支那方面負責人俞鴻鈞與工部局總裁費信惇、幾度會議後、大半已告成功、工部局並於日内將召集特别會議以討論之、是則該案之將局部份解决、似已可無疑義、但我旅滬全體僑民、必誓死反對之、蓋工部局放棄越界築路權、與我僑商、關係至爲鉅重、因支那方面、决無能力以保護我居住在越界築路範圍内之僑民生命財產也、試視一九二七年支那居民暴動之時、工部局卽立刻放棄其老靶子路以北之警備權而令我海軍陸戰隊接充、但我居住在該處之僑民財產、損失已不可統計矣、今支那與工部局所訂之收回越界築路草約中、雖有「越界築路之界内治安問題、仍由工部局組織特别警察、以保護維持之」、之一條、然仍不能予我僑民以安居樂業之完全保障、故我僑民深信此項越界築路、事實上决不能使支那方面之得寸進尺、而一任其收回、此不特在我僑民頓失生命財產之保障、卽各友邦旅滬人士、亦必受其極大之影響、且自滬戰停頓後、上海支那人士之排日舉動、仍未稍止、卽上海市長吳鐵城氏、對於其所管轄下之人民、亦毫無取締其排日及抵制日貨之權力、卽此一端、益可深信支那官長、並無約束人民之毅力、倘越界築路被支那收回後、試問我僑滬商民、所受意想中之種種危險、將至何種程度、因此特鄭重宣稱、我全體旅滬日僑、必全力反對放棄越界築路、而被支那收回也、特此宣言、希各友邦人士垂鑒之、日本居留民圑、各路商聯會謹啟、</p>

<p>满、聞宋財長以剿匪軍費、每月至少需二百四十萬元、當兹中央財政枯竭之際、開源節流、均因種種困難、未能實行、一時欲籌措此項大宗鉅欵、除舉辦新公債而外、别無辦法、故擬發行剿匪公債一種、以資接濟、關於剿匪公債發行條例草案、及各項細則、亦經宋財長擬就、由汪院長等加以審核、當經詳研之下、認爲頗有施行可能、故前日下午、汪院長等曾召集本埠銀行界輿論界各領袖談話交換意見、結果亦極满意、現汪院長等業已返京、準備將發行劃匪公債原則、提交中政會討論通過以憑實施、至公債總額、爲四百萬元、以民國二十二年海關作擔保、决由滬銀行界分别承銷云、</p>

<h3>王曉籟講内戰與商業</h3>
<p>上海市商會主席王曉籟、前日在八仙橋青年會、講演廢止内戰與商業、其講辭如下、</p>
<p>鄙人今天承青年會的約、到這裏來演講、並且預先選定一個演題、呌做内戰與商業、這個廢止内戰問題、的確是現在一個重要的、但是内戰的害處、這幾年來、給人家說了又說、痛快警闢的言論、眞算得汗牛充梀、呌鄙人還有什麽說呢、所以青年會這麽一來、倒把鄙人難倒了、講到内戰的兩個字、意思是極其明顯的、但是　的一個字、究有什麽含義呢、照我國向來的文　解釋、大凡政府爲維持一國的網紀、制止一地的暴亂、所用的武力、統統呌做征、不呌做戰、所以我國古來、有這麽幾句話、呌做「王者之師、有征無戰」、「征者上伐下也、敵國不相征也」、「禮樂征伐、自天子出」就可以證明征字的定義、那麽戰字又怎樣講呢、孟子說、爭地以戰、殺人盈野、爭城以戰、殺人盈城、又說、春秋無義戰、彼善於此、則有之矣、所以凡志在兼并他人的土地、以擴充自已的慾望、出於興師動衆的一條路、不論其假借什麽名義、統統呌做戰、近幾年來、直皖戰爭、奉直戰爭、齊盧戰爭、就統統歸入這一類了、我國古來的用字是很審愼的、後來把戰的一個字、包括得太廣了、所以這次廢止内戰運動發起的時候、有許多人說、這裏面該有一個分别、譬如剿匪的工作、是不能借内戰這個名詞來廢止的、否則不是全中國變了明季張獻忠李自成的局面嗎、又如驕兵悍將、割據一方、也不能借廢止内戰這個名目來縱容的、否則、全國不是永遠成了唐末藩鎭式的局面嗎、所以鄙人今天要討論的、就是這兩點、第一、現在吾國還能把内戰延長下去嗎、必定有一小部份人、這樣說、那末有什麽不可呢、我國綿延不絶的内戰、就歷史上先例來說、是應有的過程、是自然的趨勢、别的時代且不論、單就明清鼎革的時候計算、經過的内戰、就莊烈帝第一年算起、到康熙廿二年平定臺灣爲止、足有五十七年的長期間、就可以證明惟戰乃能止戰、其中自有一定的趨勢、不是單靠祈禱式呼籲式能消弭的、經過這一個時期以後、休養生息起來、還是一個强盛的國家、清朝康熙乾隆的時候、不是一個極好的例證嗎、我敢大胆說一句話、現在武人中、一定有這樣存心的、但是這句話、不好意思說出來罷了、否則、爲什麽嘴裏儘管贊成弭兵、手裏還是不肯罷休呢、我以爲這些人思想錯極了、（一）現在的内戰、因有外人勢力的攙入、租界的掩護、作爲退路、所以從來没有一次打個澈底、要想像從前的歷史、打一個明白、是絶對不可能的、所以以戰止戰的一句話、現在是不適用了（二）現在的戰具、不像從前那麽簡單、戰費亦不像從前那麽减少、所以從前曾湘鄉同洪楊的戰爭、時間不算不久、等到事平以後、報銷册所載、用去的軍費、不過二千多萬、軍餉惟一的來源、單靠釐金一欵、就可供給、不像現在幾年來、募了十一萬萬公債、還不算數、弄到各省抽烟稅·預征田賦·全國簡直没有一片完美的地方、俗語說、敲骨吸髓、現在已到了無骨可敲、無髓可吸的地步了、再延長下去、戰費那裏來呢、（三）因爲廿年内戰的緣故、失了一個外蒙·一個西藏·一個東三省·豫皖湘鄂閩贛等六省交界的地方、做了匪的大本營、内戰再延長下去、全國還有幾個東三省呢、匪的大本營、不是儘管可以擴充出去嗎、所以我勸當代的武人、不要做歷史上武力統一的夢了、第二、要討伐割據一方的驕將悍帥、我先要問驕將悍帥、是這麽來的、當袁世凱初當國的時候各有奉令維謹、没有一人敢越軌的、後來因爲有帝制自爲私見、要得諸將的歡心、就免不了敷衍　　的手段、所以到了他的末年、各省已有些尾大不掉的樣子了、後來馮國璋繼任、他是要利用西南以制皖系的、徐世昌接手、他是要利用皖系直系的鬥爭、以收漁人之利、因他自已的位置、所以内戰的局面、一直就此開幕、到現在還没有收場、後來的政局、差不多大同小異、不消我說得了、還有一層、當國者如果驕奢淫逸、私其親戚故舊、那末各省的武人、就得眼紅、以爲他在一個國裏這樣做法、我就可以在一省裏面做起來、况且說不定還要套了歷史上一種兵諫的名詞、覬觎取而代之呢、所以割據的造成、我是簡單兩句話、你要縱橫捭　、聯甲制乙、他就要奇貨可居、不奉國法、你要私一國、他就要私一省、要消弭這種亂源、是要當國者自已做一個好的榜樣、造成一個好的風氣、方能挽回過來、孔子有一句話、呌做「政者正也、子帥以正、孰敢不正」、就是現在消弭内戰的格言、單要靠用兵、眞呌揚湯止沸、你想歷來的討伐、不過死了幾十萬小兵、幾百萬的老百姓、於他們是絲毫不相干的、有機會就捲土重來了、所以我說、有些人說廢止内戰、不應把討伐驕將悍帥牽連在内、這句話、簡直是說不通的、因爲這樣一來、廢止内戰的話、簡直無從說起了、廢止内戰的運動、是整個國民的要求、不是商人一部份的要求、說内戰與商業有碍、不如痛快些說内戰與民生有碍、吾國是以農立國的年來内戰的結果、農村的壯丁、拉去當兵的當兵、當伕的當伕、田畝荒掉、没有人種、有好多的地方、敎你拔去嘉禾、種植烟苗、你不依他、他還要收你一種懶捐、所以内戰的害處、簡直是農民受得最普遍、最深刻、近來全國飢民化·盗匪化·的緣故、簡單一句話、就爲了農民没飯吃、我國自秦以後的歷史、必要逼到農民無路可走、然後一夫夜呼、亂者四起、現在什麽主義、什麽主義、也不過趁着這個農民失業的高潮而起罷了、所以我本想把今天的演題、修正一下、改爲廢止内戰與民生、但是這個講題、劉（湛恩）沈（嗣莊）兩位先生、早已把他公布出來了、那末、不得不就廢止内戰與商業的關係、再說一下、商業需要的、第一是資金、但是資金因内戰集中於公債、那麽商業要謀低利的通融、是不可能的、因内地秩序的不安全、現金集中於幾個大都市、釀成臣朔飽欲死、侏儒飢欲死的現象、欲求資金週轉於全國、供一般商人之挹注、是不可的、所以内戰制商人的死命、第一個就是資金缺乏、商業需要的、第二是交通、年來各路的車輛、有許多是内戰時搬出關外、到後來潘遼錦州、相繼失陷、差不多都爲日人没收了、聽說這一項車輛、總在一千兩左右呢、有話多是戰爭時損壞了、有許多是仍舊被軍隊留用、所以各路車輛、就感覺到非常缺乏、路局一方因車輛稀少、營業不旺、運費自然不能减收、所以有人調查華北的煤、運銷上海、價値要超過撫順煤開濼煤的兩倍、就不得不讓撫順煤開濼煤獨步市場了、所以内戰制商人的死命、第二就是交通中梗、商業需要的、第三就是輕說、但是這件事、在内戰不斷的形勢之下、是絶對辦不到的、因爲要用兵、就不能不多養兵、要多養兵、不能不多籌餉、這兩作事是分不開的、現在釐金、表面總算裁撤了、但是四川一省、始終淺有辦到、河北一省、裁釐後是換一側名目、呌做特種消費稅、廣東呢、又有什麽疋頭洋貨專稅局、江西近又舉辦產銷稅、江蘇亦舉辦特種營業稅、這都是變相的釐金、差不多大家都知道了、所以内戰制商人的死命第三個就是苛捐雜稅、商業需要的、第四就是銷路、銷路呢、就是靠人民有購買力了、現在豫鄂贛皖閩湘陜甘綏遠等九省、人民不化爲匪盗、就化爲飢民、這種人當然是没有購買力的、我想這樣的人民、至少總在一萬萬以上、再換一句話、就可以說全國頓時少了一萬萬人銷售商品的路了、仔細一算、商人的損失、究竟什麽程度呢、所以内戰制商人的死命、第四個就是銷路缺少、話講了半天、消弭内戰、究竟從什麽入手呢、吾們不贊成以戰制戰、亦不贊成祈禱式呼籲式的運動、當國者應該整躬率屠、使部屬覬觎攘奪的奸謀、自然消滅、人民一方面呢、亦應該明辨是非、造成挽回風氣的嚴正輿論、近來人民方面的通弊、大抵嘴裏排斥軍閥、心裏依附軍閥、一上台則满口恭維、極意交驩、一下野則希望其上台、擁護其上台、有許多還要同他合夥經營事業、所以他們胡作胡爲、在社會上簡直受不到一點制裁、莫怪他肄無忌憚呢、明季東林復社的時候、士大夫依附逆奄、貪贓枉法、一回鄉里、簡直不厠於人類、所以他們總覺得有點害怕、顯明一點說、就是以社會的力量剝奪其人格權、所以從前有一句話、呌做明人好名、清人好利、可見前代的風氣、因爲有嚴正的輿論、比現在好得多了、顧亭林曾說過這麽一句話、觀五代之可化而爲北宋、則知天下無不可挽回之風格、所以我們的廢止内戰、與其說打倒殃民禍國的軍閥、還不如一致努力、造成嚴正的輿論、良好的風氣、感化這些殃民禍國的軍閥、再進一步、民衆自已武裝起見、村里各辦民圑、努力自治、無事則防盗匪、有事則捍閭里、如果民圑能普遍於全國、卽武力不爲軍閥獨佔、内戰自可不作、這是一個根本辦法、還希大家切實努力的、</p>

<h3>蔣陶結婚</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>蔣陶結婚，胡適證婚之消息，自經本報公布後，頗惹起一般人的注意，此事的應該與不應該，當做與不當做，世人自有公評，用不着我再來評判，今天我就將蔣胡二先生的話，加以解釋。</p>
<p>蔣先生的精理名言，謂「從愛情義務中奮鬥出來的一條生路，」在蔣先生之意，以爲旣有愛情、自應該盡些義務、但這義務如何盡法呢？此次結婚，大約就是蔣先生所謂愛情的義務了，或謂蔣先生本有髮妻、離異不顧，而與陶女士結婚，世人多爲其夫人代抱不平，其實蔣先生早已說過，結婚是愛情的義務，蔣先生前妻雖已子女成行、但蔣先生亦曾與前妻結婚，則蔣先生的義務，也算盡了，尙有什麽話呢？</p>
<p>不過蔣先生說，「奮鬥出一條生路。」其實蔣先生奮鬥出來有兩條路，尙有一條路，恐怕蔣先生已忘記了，一條的確是奮鬥出來的生路、還有一條是奮鬥出來的死路、陶女士有了生路，則子女成行的髮妻，豈不是一條死路麽、故</p>
<p>我說蔣先生祗看見前面一樣很長的生路，却没有看見後面一條很短的死路。</p>
<p>至於胡先生稱贊他的「勇敢，」也有人說他不當，其實以「勇敢」二字恭維蔣先生，眞是切當極了，象這件事，在他人所不必做，不敢做，亦不忍做，而蔣先生竟毅然做了，非勇敢而何，數十年伉儷之情，不顧；幾年朋友之情，不顧；成行之子女，不顧；公理不顧，私情亦不顧，這樣的人物，不稱他勇敢還稱他什麽呢？</p>
<p>更有一義，共產黨本有共產公妻之制，現在蔣先生此種辦法，名目雖是成就一夫一妻制度，其實就是打破一夫一妻制度，若再進一步說法，就是公妻了，因爲棄妻再娶，非但法所不禁，并且視爲當然，大家樂得丢了家中的黃臉老婆，再去尋個年輕貌美的摩登女子來盡盡義務，這不是一件很有趣味的事麽，試問如此結婚，有什麽價値？</p>
<p>這事雖小，到不是一件僅僅關於蔣先生個人的事，或一家的事，若推想起來，到也關係十分重大呢？故我今天借蔣先生來談談。</p>

<h3>銅鐵雕刻法</h3>
<p>— 薦櫻樓</p>
<p>雕刻本來是一種很有趣味的藝術，如一般圖章古玩彝器文物，祗憑著雕刻者的匠心獨運，便能在靈妙的刀鋒下，刻成種種精巧的書畫圖案，可是人工雕刻，普通祗能施之於木竹玉石等物上，其他堅硬韌固的物質如玻璃水晶及金屬之類，雖有銳利的刀鋒，也不能奏效，這是雕刻家衆所引爲遺憾的，現在有一種科學的雕刻法，可以　代了人工，隨意刻成各種凹凸陰陽的字畫花紋，方法是把應刻去的部份，施以化學的作用使之爛去，不刻去的部份，用一種防爛的藥劑使之存留，這樣，便把一般雕刻家的遺憾彌補了。</p>
<p>在此我想先把銅和鐵的雕刻法介紹給讀者，以後有機會再介紹别種雕刻法</p>
<p>我們在實施雕刻銅鐵器之前，第一步手續便是配合防爛的藥劑，此種藥劑普通有兩種配合法，（一）是以黃蠟十六分，瀝青一分，　脂六分，配合而成，（二）是以蜜蠟八分，牛脂二分，松香十分，松根油十分，配合而成，這兩種防爛劑，對於銅鐵器都能適用，應用時可以把上開藥料，放在瓷器内融化調合，用筆蘸上此種溶液，在銅鐵器上書寫字畫，然後用爛蝕的藥劑爛去其他部份，使字畫凸出，這是陽文，如刻陰文，先用此劑塗满在刻物上，再用細刀刻劃字畫，把應刻部份的防爛劑刮去，然後使之爛去，則字畫便凹入而成陰文了。</p>
<p>關於爛蝕藥劑的配合，則因銅鐵器的性質不同，牠的配合的藥料和方法也不同，今試分述如下。</p>
<p>（一）銅的爛蝕劑約有兩種，一·用鹽酸鉀二十分，溶解在二百分之水内，再用純鹽酸二十分，溶解在五百分之水内，把以上兩種溶液混合在一處，便可以應用了，這爛蝕劑的化學作用極弱，爛蝕很是遲緩，適用於精細淺密的雕刻，二。用純硝酸二百六十分，酒精與磺强酸化成之依善兒（Ether）六十四分，蓨酸四分，溶解在二百五十分之水内，此種藥劑其爛蝕力比較强烈而迅速。</p>
<p>（二）鐵的爛蝕劑約有三種，一·用多量之鉻酸，溶解在少量水内，攪之使　而厚，即可應用，二·純硝酸十分，百分之三十之醋酸四十分，酒精十分，以上兩種其爛蝕力較弱，三·發烟硝酸十分，百分之三十之純醋酸三十分，加水十分，此種藥劑爛蝕力較强，適用於深而粗之雕刻。</p>
<p>以上所述，都是普通而簡易的方法，讀者諸君可在公餘如法泡製，這是很有趣味的一種小工藝咧。</p>
<p>家庭问题</p>
<h3>妻</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>曾經當過一度小學敎員的張女士，近來眞是病得難堪；譬如說罷，今天早晨起來便是頭暈，一陣劇烈的咳嗽以後，接上便是極重的酸味從肚角裏翻湧上來，於是嘔吐，嘔吐，先是隔夜的飯粒，然後是鮮黃的苦水，：：：於是更是頭暈，更是眼睛發黑，最後眞的支持不住了，只得沉重的倒在床上，以衫袖拭乾那潤濕了的眼角。</p>
<p>轉過臉來，對準睡在自已身邊的丈夫狠狠的望了一眼，只見他臉上染上一層極厚的萎黃，她知道這是每天照例醉酒的原因。在眼眶和前額的兩角，還有一層濃重的烟　，顯然是嗎啡刺激過度的結果。他很疲倦，睡得很熟甚至於打着鼾。本來這些都能使她心痛，可是她不，她知道，現在她對他的憐愛早已消萎，而且，她覺得所當加於他的只有怨恨，只有怨恨。正因爲這極度的怨恨，憂　，以致於如此瘦弱了。</p>
<p>「然而只是怨恨便能了事嗎？」她想：「他已給那姨太太迷住了，每天要去，每晚要去，簡直是非去便不可以。爲了要興奮自已便不能不抽大烟，爲了要取得她的歡心便得陪着她給醇酒燃燒，啊！她將要戕殺他了。可是，我是他的妻，我雖然有理由可以收回我所給與他的爱情，但是我能忍心望着他就這樣死去嗎？何况據他自已說：「自已爲着失業的緣故，没有方法養活妻和兩個小孩，假如没有這蕩婦來物質的帮助我們，那末我們一家人便得毁滅。：：」自然，這是丈夫甘願獻身給那姨太太的十足的理由，可是這對於丈夫和自已是怎樣刻毒的侮辱呀！啊！我出賣了丈夫，我和那些無恥的男人甘心縱妻賣淫而生活自已的一樣的可恥了！：：」</p>
<p>於是，她在傷心的哭泣了。</p>
<p>黃昏時，丈夫懶懶地起來了。她自已也不知道到底是受了誰的驅使，即刻便爲他打好了洗臉水，而且小心的服侍着。當她在廚房裏預備着晚飯的時候；她偷偷地看着他結好的領結，穿了新的衣服，并且已是天熱了還要擦上多量的雪花膋。：：：</p>
<p>她的心情是如此恍惚，她簡直不能相信他還是自已的丈夫。</p>
<p>汗如淚混合着掛在唇邊。</p>
<p>當她服侍着孩子們和丈夫會食的時候，她偶然的迎合了他所給與她的慘澹的笑容，立刻承迎着說：</p>
<p>「蓮兒爸爸！（她自生了大女兒蓮香以後便是這樣稱呼他的。）今天晚上不出去可以嗎？你看你的身體眞是來不及了。」</p>
<p>「：：」丈夫是没有回答。</p>
<p>「那末你爲了她就完全：：」　　「我也請求你，請你别再麻煩我。」</p>
<p>電燈亮了，丈夫依舊大膽的走出了大門。</p>
<p>她再也不能忍受了，强烈的憤恨完全攫緊了的心胸。一股奇腥湧上心頭，接上是殷紅的一口鮮血。不曉事的孩子們爲了母親的瘋狂恐嚇得號哭，這更使她覺着煩亂，於是她猛力的捉住大的一個没頭没腦的亂打，甚至想將他們立刻吞下，最後她終於不顧一切的跑了出去，雖然小防兒們仍在發出强烈的哭聲。</p>
<p>約摸是午夜的時候她頽然的從一個賭場裏面來。她輸了，她將所有的銀洋都輸掉，同時她更多量的喝了酒，因爲她想在醉中得着少許的安慰。本來她不願再回到家來，可是蹒跚的終於到了門口。當她開了後門進去的時候，簡直使她疑心是在夢裏；自已的丈夫和那女人並坐着飲着啤酒，立刻是他的手驚惶的從女人肩上收回，强烈的烟香直噴過來，那女人是一抺驕傲的微笑，似乎在說；「我完全佔據着你的丈夫了。」於是她再沉重的倒在床上，無力的不再動顫了。</p>

<h3>一所立案的學校</h3>
<p>— 逖修</p>
<p>昨日。我因爲有要事去訪一位朋友，當經過某一條衖堂的時候，忽然在我的眼廉之前，發現了一所老舊不堪的房屋，而這所房子的門前，又掛上了二塊招牌，一塊是某某棉布號，再有一塊，原來是一所小學校，而且亦是市敎育局立案的，上海是寸金地，我本來也很明白的，但是一所學校，總不可馬馬虎虎的這樣隨便，何况還是敎育局立案的，當時我因爲一時好奇心的衝動，就去探聽該校内容。</p>
<p>經過了一番的考查偵察，該校一切的一切，統於給我知道了，原來該校的組織，完全家庭化，商業化，所謂校長敎員，多是一家人，正如一家商店，他們雖然一家只有五個人，然而名義却也是這樣的多，什麽敎務長，訓育主任。會計事務等等，都爲他們担任或兼任，學生却也有一百五十餘，一天的課程，照樣也是六點鐘，一切的科目，却也很全備，他們的校舍，一共三上三下，一上一下就是借給棉布號的，實際該校的校舍，只有二上二下，但是却也有住舍生，那眞太夠玩味了。</p>
<p>至於該校的經濟問題，那末又爲生面别開，男學生交來的學費，歸老板所有，女學生交來的學費，歸老板娘娘所有，校中的開館及經費，歸老板負責，他們家　　的費用，歸老板娘娘擔任，倒也是有條不　　次序井然啊。</p>
<p>近日該校對於本學期，亦快結束了，但他們爲了他們的：：：又很努力地計劃下學期的招生了，該校近日通告舊生，對於下學期的學費，若能在現在即刻交下的說話，那末可便宜大洋一元，外加還有一頂帽子的贈品呢，商業競爭現在是已經尖銳化，深刻化，學校的競爭，也在漫漫地開始了。</p>
<p>至於這樣簡陋的一個學校，却亦能得到敎育局的垂青，與歡喜，能夠立案，這或許是該校的老板交際的廣　，手段的靈活所致啊。</p>
<p>黑幕</p>
<h3>如此敎育</h3>
<p>— 銘勳</p>
<p>素不看報上廣告的我，昨天偶然拿了ＸＸ報看看，眼簾中突然發現『聘請敎員』的一側廣告，這個廣告的内容，姑把牠抄在下面，紹介於未寓目讀者之前。</p>
<p>兹有某校託聘要職一位兼辦暑期學　　校月薪二十元至三十元膳宿全供但　　須有現金保證願就者請即日下午二　　時至五時往法租界甘世東路ＸＸＸ　　路口Ｘ邨ＸＸ號ＸＸ烟紙店Ｘ樓向　　Ｘ君接洽。</p>
<p>本來登在上海各報廣告聘請職員：：：要保證金等虚僞黑幕，原是很多很多的，但現在竟把這黑幕劇般演到這立國根本的敎育界上，哈哈，這也須我們中國人玩玩新花樣，做個敎育發明家嗎？我不得不五體投地，令人佩服。</p>
<p>在這千瘡百孔瀕瀕破產的中國·社會，失業者想去找一噉飯之地，的確是一椿千難萬難的事情，就是有飛天交際手腕的職業介紹者，恐怕也不能容納這許多話多的飯碗，如今旣然有這麽一椿機會，那麽一般失業者當然要越之若釐，山陰道上，有應接不暇之勢，不過。以上面這段廣告看來，當一個敎員也要有一筆保證金拿出去，這未免使敎育人才喪失了敎育精神，而令一般當敎者望洋興嘆，無錢莫當敎員之感喟了。</p>
<p>還有一些使我懷疑的，就是這般學校的校長，眞要招聘人才，落得可以公開招聘，也何必託人代聘，多費手續，豈非也似軍事外交秘密不可公開嗎？這些這些·我無以名之，只名之曰神秘奇形黑暗怪敎育，但是這位校長先生葫蘆裏到底賣些什麽藥，我再三索思，仍令丈二和尙，摸不着頭腦。</p>
<p>似上面種種，由此類推，唉｜我們就可知道社會｜無處無事不是虚僞的黑暗的，（當然也有少數例外）青年男女們｜我們要當心誤落，致免一失足成千古　呀。</p>

<h3>Rumors of an Emergency in the North China Situation</h3>
<h3>Bin</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors of an emergency in the North China situation. The puppet state of Manchukuo, instigated by Japan, is said to be preparing a large-scale invasion of the mainland. Such talk is rampant. Our people, living in peace and comfort, may have long forgotten the national crisis, unaware that our country is advancing towards a perilous future. If disaster were to strike North China, our country's future would be utterly unimaginable. Looking north, we are truly at a loss.</p>
<p>Since September 18th, nine months have passed. Zhang Xueliang adopted a policy of non-resistance, and his entire army fled, allowing all of the three northeastern provinces to fall. The government, adopting a policy of non-resistance, non-defense, procrastination, and complacency, allowed the puppet state of Manchukuo to be established. The Japanese were able to fully prepare for military action in the Northeast. The people daily called for the suppression of the puppet state and the recovery of lost territory. The government also daily declared its greatest determination and full preparation to recover lost territory. However, nine months have passed, and the people's calls remain the same, as do the government's declarations. No preparation has been seen for suppressing the puppet state or recovering lost territory. Now, the puppet state is preparing to invade without waiting for our suppression. The government is fostering trouble and bringing misfortune upon itself. It has misled the country to this extent. What more can be said? When the disaster in the Northeast first erupted, we had already asserted that the Japanese ambition would not stop at seizing the Northeast. If the Northeast could be seized, then Peiping and Tientsin could also be attacked. Under the policy of non-resistance, the natural barrier of Shanhaiguan could eventually be crossed. Although Peiping and Tientsin are good, it is difficult to guarantee that they can rest easy. Since the assassination of Inukai and the intensification of the Japanese fascist movement, the hardline policy toward China has become the center of Japanese public opinion. However, Zhang Xueliang lies idle in Peiping and Tientsin, spending his days singing, dancing, and enjoying himself, long forgetting the hatred of family and country. The central government merely chants about "internal pacification before external resistance," dampening the spirits of the people. Troops can be mobilized to suppress bandits, but why can't elite troops be dispatched to resist Japan? Bandit suppression can be done "quickly," "forcefully," and "substantially," but why has resistance against Japan been delayed for more than half a year, with only calls but no action? The government truly does not know how to justify itself.</p>
<p>The Northeast is the territory of the country, not the private property of an individual. As the commander responsible for defending the territory, Zhang Xueliang completely retreated when foreign aggression came. If we speak of rectifying discipline, then holding Zhang accountable for losing territory and misleading the country is appropriate. Who would say it is not? If not, then a strict order should be given to organize troops to cross the border, recover lost territory, and make amends for his faults. Who would say it is not appropriate? However, the central government has consistently been lenient and has provided much protection. The country's disciplinary system has been swept away, and Zhang still possesses a large army, resembling a powerful figure in North China. To speak of sending troops to resist is seen as deliberately making things difficult for him and sacrificing his strength. This kind of behavior that values individual rights and ignores national sovereignty is truly perplexing. Now, there are rumors of an emergency in Peiping and Tientsin. Comparing it to the rumors before the September 18th Incident, we cannot say that the Japanese will not attempt to seize Peiping and Tientsin. If disaster were to strike, and Zhang Xueliang still adopted a policy of non-resistance, would the central government still sit idly by, regarding the people of Yue as fat like those of Qin?</p>
<p>According to Wang Jingwei's recent report, regarding national defense, Zhang will come south to consult with Chiang. The country is in danger, and the Northeast has been lost for nine months. Yet, when it comes to national defense, it still awaits consultation. The affairs of the country have been neglected to this extent, which is truly a sign of national demise. If this habit of complacency is not eradicated, and if the entire country cannot actively invigorate itself, then even without Japanese invaders, our country's future will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>We believe that today, we should actively assist the righteous armies struggling arduously in the Northeast and strictly order Zhang Xueliang to prepare for resistance. If he cannot, then it would be better to clearly order his removal and dispatch elite troops to strengthen national defense. The matter is urgent, and the lessons of the past are not far off. The authorities should wake up quickly.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team Arrives in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Japanese Youth Distribute Leaflets Expressing Opposition Upon Arrival</p>
<p>Lytton Issues a Statement Explaining the Mission of This Trip</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations Investigation Team arrived at Tokyo Station at 8:00 AM today. Representatives from the Foreign Ministry, the Army and Navy Ministries, and personnel from the embassies of England, America, France, Italy, and Germany were present to welcome them. The group then checked into the Imperial Hotel. Lytton went directly from the station to the British Embassy to meet with the British Ambassador, Lindley. (Nichi-Ren Agency Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations Investigation Team, led by Lord Lytton, arrived in Tokyo at 8:00 AM today. Before Lytton arrived in Tokyo, a group of Japanese Fascist Party members threw many leaflets from the windows of the Tokyo Station Hotel, stating that they would expel Lytton and his entourage. The content was as follows: "Taking this opportunity, the people must rise up to express the will of the Japanese people. Manchuria was created with the blood and sweat of many Japanese people. Therefore, Japan naturally has the right to claim special interests. Manchuria must recognize Japan's special political rights, and no foreigners are allowed to interfere. England and the United States must immediately withdraw from Manchuria and Mongolia. No interference from you Europeans is allowed. The people must unite and immediately expel Lytton and his entourage." (Hua-Lian Agency Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 7:30 AM this morning, when the League of Nations Investigation Team was about to arrive at Tokyo Station, leaflets were distributed expressing the Japanese people's determination regarding the investigation committee. The slogans stated, "Defend the rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia built with the blood and flesh of our fathers and brothers. The League of Nations should resign for world peace. Regarding the handling of the China problem, the Japanese people have unanimously decided to recognize Manchukuo. Independent Youth Society, July, Showa 7." (Nichi-Ren Agency Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Consul-General in Korea Visits Lytton</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources state that a Nichi-Ren Agency telegram from Tokyo on the 1st reported that the Chinese Consul-General in Seoul visited Lord Lytton but was not received. This is completely inaccurate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a telegram from Consul-General Lu stating that he met with the investigation team on the 1st for 20 minutes and personally handed over an important document. (Special Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Lord Lytton Currently Suffering from a Minor Ailment</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Lord Lytton is currently suffering from a cold and stomach problems, but his condition is not serious. Lytton is currently residing at the British Embassy. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Lytton Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Osaka: Lord Lytton, the chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Committee, issued a lengthy statement yesterday afternoon while passing through Osaka on his way to Tokyo. The statement began by praising the beauty of the Japanese scenery, followed by a desire to meet with the current cabinet officials to exchange views, and then strongly emphasized the original mission of the investigation team. According to Chinese reports, it is expected that we will receive from China the conditions for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute and present those items to the Japanese government. I have also learned that it is reported that we intend to propose to the League of Nations a five-year trial period for the Manchurian regime. Now, the press in various countries is eager to know where the mission of the investigation team lies. At this time, the issuance of such reports cannot be said to be unreasonable, but we do not have any authority over this issue. As we come to Japan again, we clearly state that we are investigation committee members, not negotiators. Our mission and purpose are to collect all relevant facts regarding this dispute and report to the League of Nations. Among these relevant facts, the most important are the permanent rights and interests that China and Japan have in the disputed region. It goes without saying that before harmonizing these rights and interests, it is most necessary to first clarify what these rights and interests are. The League of Nations authorities, based on the knowledge we obtain and the advice to the League of Nations Council, will implement the task of mediating the disputes between China and Japan. This is the mission of the League of Nations. The public opinion of China and Japan is not yet familiar with our mission. Now, the people of both countries have great anxiety about what kind of report the committee will make. As a result, there are still many uncertainties about the future of the committee's implementation of its mission. Both China and Japan are very afraid of being asked by the League of Nations to concede or change a part of their important rights and interests. Therefore, it seems difficult for the newspapers of both China and Japan to advocate a moderate attitude to their own people. There is still a shadow over the future resolution of the dispute between China and Japan. We are confident that our investigation has a great impact on the life and death rights and interests of both China and Japan. Therefore, we hope for good results from our efforts. If both China and Japan can realize this fact, then the gospel of peace will prevail. The purpose of our efforts is to realize this peace. (Nichi-Ren Agency Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government to Issue Statement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is expected that after the investigation team arrives in Tokyo and after Uchida assumes the position of Foreign Minister, the Japanese government will issue its firm attitude regarding future recognition of the "Manchukuo issue." According to Japanese newspapers, the government will declare the following: First, the League of Nations resolution regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops into the railway zone is no longer valid, because when that resolution was passed, Manchuria was still part of China, but now Manchuria has declared independence. Regarding the Manchurian customs issue, the approximate future result is that Japan will allow "Manchukuo" to manage the Dalian customs, but will still recognize that the customs belongs to China, so an appropriate amount must be transferred to the Chinese government to pay off foreign debts.

<h3>Professors from National Central University Go to the Executive Yuan to Demand Back Pay</h3>
<p>Received by Secretary Zhang Changyan</p>
<p>He Promised to Convey to the President and Handle as Appropriate</p>
<p>They Then Went to the Ministry of Education to Petition</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A back-pay demanding group of professors and assistant teachers from National Central University, including Ding Sixian and Zong Baihua, a total of over fifty people, went to the Executive Yuan at eight o'clock in the morning on the 4th. They were received by Secretary Zhang Changyan, who heard their three demands: (1) The government should immediately fulfill the employment contract issued by former President Zhu in order to allow teachers to leave the school. (2) The government should send a high-ranking official to thoroughly investigate Zhu Jiahua's embezzlement of funds and the truth about his insulting remarks towards teachers' personality. (3) As long as the government has not fulfilled the employment contract and paid all the back pay, the status of the teachers exists for one day, and they have the right to conduct research at the school for one day. The school must not close down the research room and preparation room. It is hoped that the government will provide urgent and effective relief for the school authorities' various illegal actions. Secretary Zhang promised to convey points one and two in detail and to discuss reopening the research room and preparation room with Vice Minister Duan before replying. Around 5:00 PM, it was reported by a high-ranking secretary of the Ministry of Education that Vice Minister Qian had something to do and could not return to the ministry. Some professors advocated taking the Ministry of Education's car to his private residence, while others advocated going to President Wang's private residence. As a result, it was decided that they would go to the Ministry of Education again on the morning of the 5th to hear the reply. If there was no solution, they would go to the Executive Yuan again to petition. The professors of National Central University issued four points of reason at four o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>(1) Dissolving the university is the right of the government, fulfilling the employment contract is the obligation of the government, and obeying legal orders is our obligation. Demanding the payment of salaries according to the employment contract is our right. (2) The teachers' positions will remain for as long as the salary stipulated in the contract has not been paid in full. (3) Without canceling the teachers' qualifications, the teachers have the right to conduct research at the school. The school gates must not be closed and the research rooms must not be locked down. (4) We absolutely obey the government's order to dissolve the university. Please pay us the salary we deserve immediately to show the government's determination to dissolve the university and to show the Ministry of Education's sincerity in executing the dissolution order so that our colleagues can immediately obey the order to dissolve.

<h3>Authorities Plan to Disperse Students</h3>

<h3>Financial Situation Remains Unresolved, Banking and Business Sectors Unable to Provide Loans</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Financial sources state that the visit of various dignitaries to Shanghai to discuss financial matters seems to have produced few results. This is because before the Sino-Japanese War last year, the banking and business sectors in Shanghai had undertaken to provide a monthly loan of five to six million yuan, and the remaining five million yuan was collected from the salt tax, tobacco and alcohol taxes, stamp taxes, and unified taxes, which was close to the expenditure plan during the downsizing period. After the war in Shanghai broke out, the banking and business sectors were unable to handle self-rescue and were unable to follow the plan. The financial authorities were forced to discount public debt interest and extend the repayment period, freeing up some cash. In addition, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity, the Sino-American Boxer Indemnity, and overseas Chinese donations also provided slight contributions, which were just enough to cover the military expenses during the war. During the war, commerce in Shanghai was depressed, and the original agreement of five million yuan from the banking sector was also difficult to fulfill. The military felt that the monthly military expenses of ten million yuan during the downsizing period were now far from enough and required at least another two million yuan. Also, government expenses had not been fully paid before, and it was estimated that the required military and government expenses actually exceeded fourteen million yuan per month. According to the current strength of the Shanghai banks, they can at most maintain the original plan of last year. Song Ziwen will try his best to implement the original plan for the downsizing period, and if more is needed, he is willing to relinquish his position to someone more capable. Therefore, although the military and government are urging frequently, the financial strength is only so much, so there is no concrete result. Also, when the Hubei special tax was prosperous in previous years, the monthly revenue was seven million yuan, and the government could still withdraw one to two million yuan. Now, the Sichuan army is in Yichang, directly exporting local products, and there are also many new products in Anhui, Huaihai, and Xuhai, so the Hubei special tax only has six to seventy million yuan left each month, which is only enough to cover office expenses.

<h3>Soviet Russia Confident in its Ability to Restrain Japan</h3>
<p>The Combination of the United States and Russia is Enough to Curb Japan's Expansionist Ambitions</p>
<p>Russian Newspapers Warn Japan Not to Be Reckless in Relying on Foreign Aid</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: Recently, the rumor that Japan has ambitions to invade Siberia has been rife. From the observation of the Soviet Russian authorities, they feel that the United States' recognition of Soviet Russia is the only way to save the critical situation. The United States' recognition of the Moscow government, no matter what form it takes, is enough to give the Japanese obsessed warlords a dose of cooling powder. However, the Soviet Russian government authorities have not yet been able to formally express this view, because they still do not want to expose the traces of their request for recognition. Furthermore, if the Soviet Russian side too seriously hopes for the recognition of other countries, it would be unwise in politics and lose dignity in general. Therefore, it is better to remain silent and not to involve the United States itself in suspicion of interference. However, in an unofficial manner, a Russian person close to the government said that the combination of the Soviet Union and the United States can make "military arsonists" turn away in fear. This person also said, "The reason why the Soviet Union hopes for the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States is not because the Soviet Union has no confidence in defeating Japan. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union can defeat Japan. However, the Soviet Union deeply does not want the world to be troubled, because Russia is now striving for peaceful development. If there is a way to avoid war, we are happy to follow it." The propaganda of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia has been going on for a long time. Although the newspapers in Moscow have not commented on it, it is known that the Soviet Russian side is also very concerned about this matter. Soviet Russian leaders have clearly stated that the Soviet Russian attitude has been fully understood by Washington, and in the future, it will only depend on how the United States makes its next move. Now, the Red Flag newspaper, the organ of the Russian Army, has published an editorial warning Japan not to act rashly and advising Japan not to rely on the foreign aid of a strong country to make trouble with Soviet Russia, because foreign aid may not materialize. The newspaper's words clearly refer to the United States' aid to Japan. The newspaper also said that even if foreign aid can be obtained, the one who provides aid to Japan will never want Japan to enjoy the results of victory. In the end, it said, "The imperialist countries may use Japan to restrain Soviet Russia, but at most they only want to use Japan's claws to snatch chestnuts from the fire. How can Japan be an enemy to the great powers? And how can the great powers allow Japan to do whatever it wants?"</p>
<h3>New Dawn at the Lausanne Reparations Conference</h3>
<p>MacDonald's Plan Opens the Door for Continued Negotiations</p>
<p>Germany Proposes a Counterproposal Declaring Three Reservations</p>
<p>And Firmly Demanding the Amendment of Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Herriot Rushes to Lausanne Overnight</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 3rd: The hope for an early and peaceful resolution to the reparations issue has been greatly brightened by the efforts of all parties today. Although it cannot be said that today is the day when the negotiations turned from danger to safety, those in the conference generally believe that a basis for continued negotiations has been found. This basis is the recently revised plan of the former Allied Powers, which was sent to German Prime Minister Papen this afternoon. Before British Prime Minister MacDonald sent the new plan, he had a long conversation with Papen, with the German Foreign Minister also in attendance. After the consultation, representatives of the five major countries held another meeting to make final revisions to the new plan before sending it to the German side. This new plan can be called the MacDonald Plan, which is very different from what the French representatives previously insisted on. It stipulates that Germany pay 400 million marks as compensation for the cancellation of reparations. This amount will be raised by Germany issuing bonds with an interest rate of 5% plus 1% as a fund, which will be temporarily stored in the International Clearing Bank. After the three-year grace period expires, it can be issued on the international market, but it must be certain that the international market has the ability to absorb this debt before it can be sold. After this plan was formally sent to the German Prime Minister, the German Prime Minister immediately raised three reservations: (1) regarding the total amount, (2) regarding the layer of the German government not having an appropriate guarantee on the issuance of bonds, and (3) regarding the method of establishing a chain between reparations and war debts. British Prime Minister MacDonald immediately reconvened a meeting of creditor nations, raised the points opposed by Germany for discussion, and it was heard that the British Prime Minister believed that several points disputed by Germany were indeed true. After the meeting of creditor nations, German Prime Minister Papen sent out the German counterproposal, which is still being studied by the creditor nations tonight. Currently, the French and German representatives are communicating with their own governments by telephone. It is expected that negotiations will continue throughout the night, and a certain agreement can be obtained tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 3rd: Since the reparations conference undertook the arduous task of mediating the major issues of war debts and reparations, it is unknown how many discussions, meetings, and negotiations have taken place. Only today has there been a glimpse of a result. A resolution is now in sight, but it has not yet been reached. Germany's opposition to a certain proposal by the powers is now an obstacle to progress, but it is generally felt that this obstacle can be removed, as it is expected that Germany's opposition and response are nothing more than an effort to obtain concessions. Germany opposes three points in the plan proposed by the five powers, Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, and Japan: (1) the amount of money Germany must pay for the European economic rehabilitation fund, (2) the conditions for issuing the proposed European rehabilitation fund bonds, and (3) the guarantee clauses regarding US war debts. The Germans now demand the abolition of the portion of the Treaty of Versailles regarding reparations, and the clause in the treaty that Germany was the culprit of the war is especially opposed by the Germans. Germany also demands that the date of issuance of the European economic rehabilitation fund bonds must be decided by the entire board of directors of the International Clearing Bank, and cannot be decided by majority consent. Germany further demands that to issue bonds, there must be appropriate guarantees for the German market and German debt credit. Germany believes that the amount of 400 million marks that Germany should pay for the European economic rehabilitation fund is too large and demands that it be halved. The above German demands may cause major opposition, and it will be especially difficult for France to recognize them. However, according to general speculation, Germany's presentation of this answer is only to hope to continue to obtain benefits, so it is not expected to lead to a stalemate after all.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 3rd: The German creditor group met this morning to discuss Germany's rejection of the reparations settlement plan. It is said that they paid particular attention to Germany's insistence that any solution must clearly state that the reparations clauses in the Treaty of Versailles are invalid. It is also said that the counterproposal put forward by Germany states that the principal that Germany is capable of paying is at most 200 million marks, and it is willing to pay cash of 160 million marks annually in ten years. If Germany is forced to pay more, it will be necessary to issue public bonds. The German government is also willing to discuss it, but it prefers to pay cash, and suggests that this amount should be handled by the Baiser International Clearing Bank. Once Germany has paid for three years, the European Rehabilitation Fund should be established.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 4th: Herriot was scheduled to return to Lausanne tomorrow night, but has decided to depart tonight. The reason for his sudden change of plans is unknown.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 4th: As the situation in Lausanne is worrying, President Hindenburg has decided to wait until the conference is over before going to Newdeck, his hometown. The President was originally scheduled to leave Beijing today, but after a long conversation with Papen on the phone, he cancelled all arrangements, as the five major creditor nations have now put forward a reparations settlement plan, and the conference is at a critical moment. All responsible parties are now denying the claim that Germany has submitted a counterproposal to the five major countries, saying that the memorandum that Papen sent to British Prime Minister MacDonald last night only listed the opinions of the German delegation rejecting the plan of the five major countries. The three points it focuses on are (1) the total amount of the European Rehabilitation Fund that Germany should pay, which is 400 million marks, (2) the incomplete guarantee for issuing bonds as the final payment after the three-year grace period, and (3) linking reparations and war debts together, so that if the United States refuses to cancel or reduce war debts, France or other countries can deny the stipulations of Lausanne. Germany believes that this plan will make the Lausanne agreement empty and unreliable, and it is not compatible with the main purpose of convening the conference, which is the need to restore credit. According to the Democratic Morning Post, Germany's reservations also reiterate the political demand to abolish the unequal clauses in the Treaty of Versailles, restore equality between Germany and other countries, and restore Germany's freedom of action. Germany will guarantee to do its best to assist in the rehabilitation of the European economy. This news could not be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Rescuing Austrian Finances Have Been Successful</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 3rd: Negotiations on rescuing Austrian finances, which have been going on for a long time, have finally been completed today. They are only awaiting the approval of the League of Nations and the French Assembly before they can be implemented. The plan is to lend 300 million Austrian schillings (approximately US$38 million) to the Austrian National Bank. Britain and France will each be responsible for 100 million Austrian schillings. Britain will extend the term of its matured loans. The remaining 30 million Austrian schillings will be taken on by Italy, and Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium will jointly take on 70 million Austrian schillings. Sweden may join in taking on a portion. Professor Bairuns of the famous Dutch financier has recently resigned as a consultant to the Austrian National Bank and will be hired as a commissioner of the creditor nations in the future. In addition, Dr. Luther will represent the Finance Committee of the League of Nations and serve as a consultant to the Austrian National Bank.</p>
<h3>The French Government's Plan to Reduce Government Spending and Increase Taxes is Stalled in Parliament</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 3rd: Today, the Finance Committee of the French National Assembly refused to pass the government's plan to make up for the deficit, and a dangerous situation has arisen again in French politics. According to the government's plan, it is proposed to reduce the salaries of civil servants and increase new taxes, which is expected to raise a total of 400 million francs. However, the Socialist Party and some Radical Party members opposed this plan. The Finance Committee greatly revised it, and it is expected to raise only 250 million francs. The Minister of Budget has already left Paris last night to meet with Herriot, who is returning east from Lausanne, to report this matter on the way. It is heard that Herriot has decided to make a final exhortation to the Finance Committee, hoping to pass the original plan, but Herriot's return to Lausanne will be delayed as a result.</p>
<h3>German Social Democratic Party's Uniform Parade and Demonstration Fortunately No Incident Occurred</h3>
<p>Reuters, Munich, 3rd: The government of the German state of Bavaria has strictly prohibited the wearing of party uniforms for the past two years. Those who wear party uniforms for outings are arrested. The central government recently issued an order to lift this ban, but the Bavarian government initially did not comply. A few weeks ago, 42 National Socialist Party members wore party uniforms to the Bavarian State Assembly, which resulted in their suspension from attending. However, the Bavarian government has now complied with the central government's order and abolished this ban. However, party uniforms can still be banned when public safety is threatened, and outdoor gatherings are also not allowed, but the police station must be notified 48 hours in advance. Today, the National Socialist Party was able to hold a demonstration here. 15,000 people wearing party uniforms marched through the streets of Munich. Party leader Hitler gave a speech to 40,000 party members. Applause was frequent and cheers were constant. About 100 communists attempted to break through their ranks, but were blocked by the police. Several people were arrested, but no other incidents occurred.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 3rd: The Austrian National Socialist Party paraded past Hitler here today, and no incidents occurred. It is estimated that more than 50,000 people participated in this event.</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Inquires About Japanese Seizure of Taxes</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th: During a meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Conservative Party member Samuel asked the Foreign Secretary whether he had received a statement from the Japanese government regarding its voluntary actions regarding the Dalian Customs, and whether the Japanese government had guaranteed to abide by the 1907 treaty to maintain the integrity of the Chinese Customs and all debts. Deputy Foreign Minister Eden replied that the Japanese government had promised to make every effort to achieve a satisfactory mediation on this matter, and also said that the 1907 treaty only established a customs office in Dalian to prevent smuggling. Samuel then asked, "Does the Foreign Secretary know that if the 1907 treaty is broken, the result will be that Manchurian commerce will fall completely into the hands of the Japanese?" Eden replied that he was well aware of the importance of this agreement, which is why the British government has made inquiries. Eden then announced that he had just received the full text of the Shanghai and Ming Chamber of Commerce's resolution to convene a round table conference, which is currently under consideration.</p>

<h3>印回教徒械鬥又作</h3>
<p>Reoccurrence of Armed Conflict between Muslims and Hindus</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 3rd - The peace in Bombay, which was about to last for a month, was suddenly broken today by a large-scale armed conflict between Hindus and Muslims. The authorities were compelled to dispatch troops to suppress it. The mobs on both sides initially engaged in mutual beatings, followed by destruction of property and arson. Shops were vandalized, and even passersby were affected due to religious affiliations. In the evening, sources from the police station and police academy revealed that four people had died, thirty were seriously injured, and many more were wounded but not hospitalized. In the urgent situation, a detachment of British soldiers was ordered to rush to the scene of the incident, clear the streets, and restore order. The police also fired shots to disperse the mob. The authorities have now declared martial law again. Residents, disturbed by this turmoil, were either afraid to go out or fled to other places. The police have arrested thousands of rioters. At night, apart from police and soldiers patrolling, the streets were deserted. The authorities have prohibited gatherings of more than five people. The losses suffered by shops and other establishments are estimated at several hundred thousand rupees.</p>

<h3>日本農村經濟窮乏之原因</h3>
<p>Causes of the Poverty of the Japanese Rural Economy</p>
<p>— Huai Ren</p>
<p>A fierce wave of world economic turmoil began after 1929, in Tokyo correspondence. The decline of purchasing power, the sharp fall in prices, the phenomenon of the skewed distribution of gold, the disastrous drop in silver prices, and the surge in unemployment, all posed a major threat to the world. This was inevitable. Capitalism, which had gradually risen after the Industrial Revolution, had entered its final stage. These misfortunes were "self-inflicted," because many causes had been sown long ago. The proliferation of negative phenomena today is merely the eruption of the consequences.</p>
<p>This global wave of recession has swept the globe (except for the Soviet Union). The pre-war prosperous European economy is now barely surviving. The capitalist kingdom of the United States has deeply felt the troubles of overproduction. China, suffering from the recent cause of the disastrous fall in silver prices, is riddled with holes. All other countries are feeling the shakeup within their own systems. In the past, the United States' silver bailout plan, Hoover's war debt postponement proposal, the economic conference on the Danube River, and the recent Lausanne reparations conference, and the future world economic conference—who doesn't want to rescue themselves from this abyss of recession? However, the world today is full of contradictory phenomena: the contradiction between capitalism and non-capitalism, the contradiction between the propertied and the propertyless, the contradiction between Country A and Country B, the contradiction between the mother country and the colony. To revive the economy from such numerous contradictions can only result in disappointment. Therefore, the world economic panic of the past few years remains unresolved, and the global crisis continues to unfold.</p>
<p>Japan, on the west coast of the Pacific, after the Meiji Restoration and the golden opportunity of World War I, has embarked on a very typical path of capitalism. In these years of global economic panic, when capitalism is gradually becoming impoverished, Japan is, of course, no exception. The reduction in purchasing power, the drop in prices, the contraction of production: the economic world has been in great turmoil. The most obvious manifestation of this is the poverty of the Japanese rural economy. The Japanese peasant class, who cannot get enough to eat, is parasitic under the machinery of capitalism, and has deeply felt the hardship of being heavily squeezed in the past era of prosperity. Therefore, in today's economic panic of capitalism, the increase in rural poverty is certainly not an accidental and sudden event.</p>
<p>Today, Japanese farmers are directly affected by the decline in agricultural product prices, falling into the misfortune of a sharp reduction in income. On the other hand, due to the use of high-interest loans, they have fallen into the miserable state of being exploited and slaughtered. According to recent statistics, each farming household bears an average debt of seven or eight hundred yen, and the income earned is not only insufficient to pay off the debt, but also insufficient to maintain life. Under such circumstances, farmers have to resort to all sorts of drastic measures. According to a survey in November last year, in Nishioguni Village, Mogami County, Yamagata Prefecture, out of 467 young girls aged 15 to 24, 150 were employed as maids, and another 110 were living the life of prostitutes (accounting for 23% of the total). The price obtained from selling their bodies far away from their families is used to repay high-interest loans.</p>
<p>Let's first examine the reasons for the poverty of the Japanese rural economy. The first reason that should be mentioned here is the error in Japan's past economic policy. The two major political parties in Japan, the Minseito and the Seiyukai, are supported by the Mitsubishi and Mitsui zaibatsu (financial combines). Therefore, past party politics can be said to be a metropolitan-centric administration. The economic policies under this administrative system, needless to say, are aimed at the prosperity and convenience of commerce and industry and cities, while agriculture and rural areas are regarded as trivial. In the past ten or twenty years, the burden of public taxes and levies on agricultural workers has often exceeded twice that of commercial and industrial workers with the same income, and recently it may have been three or four times as much. What about the rights obtained by agricultural workers bearing such a heavy burden? Finance is concentrated in cities, and it is entrepreneurs who enjoy the benefits of low costs, not agricultural workers. Public facilities such as schools and hospitals are located in cities, and it is city dwellers who can enjoy their benefits at a very low cost, not agricultural workers who live far in the suburbs. The accumulated ills of this metropolitan-centric administration have created the distant cause of the poverty of the Japanese rural economy today. Although, rural areas have also received some government favor at some point—the provision of low-interest loans—but in reality, the common people have not benefited. It is the landlord class that can obtain the benefits of low-interest loans.</p>
<p>The second reason for the poverty of the Japanese rural economy is the great collapse of agricultural product prices in the past two or three years. A piglet worth seven yen, plus twelve yen of feed, cannot be sold for more than eight yen when it grows up. A bale of grain worth twenty yen, plus fertilizer and labor, can only be sold for twenty-two yen. The prices of all agricultural products, such as rice, cocoons, vegetables, chicken eggs, and dairy meat, have fallen, and thus the income of farming households has been greatly reduced. On average, the sales volume of each farming household has decreased by roughly more than one hundred yen. For farming households with generally low daily incomes, the amount of income reduction has exceeded two or three times one hundred yen. In other words, each farming household has reduced its income by one-half or two-thirds. The sharp decline in the income of farming households has rapidly and directly created extreme poverty in the rural economy.</p>
<p>In addition, the single-crop farming is the third reason for the poverty of the rural economy in some parts of Japan. The single-crop farming, of course, will not cause any difficult problems in times of prosperity, but once in years of recession, farming households have no choice but to be impoverished due to the lack of flexibility. For example, in some places in Japan that produce raw silk, their only agricultural operation is "spring silkworms." Therefore, when silk prices plummet, they have no way to switch to rice farming or other agricultural operations, and the rural economy in this place has fallen into poverty.</p>
<p>The crop failure in northeastern Japan and Hokkaido last year is also a recent cause of the poverty of the Japanese rural economy. "A storm is brewing." Under such overlapping reasons, the bankruptcy and decline of the Japanese rural economy seem inevitable.</p>
<h3>東京雜訊</h3>
<p>Tokyo Miscellany</p>
<p>Nomura's Injuries are Not Light - The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reported that although Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura had lost his sight in one eye, and there was no danger to his life, he still had 130 shrapnel fragments in his body that had not been removed. Upon returning to Japan, after receiving a personal commendation from the Military Councilor, he went to the medical school clinic of the Tsukiji Navy on the afternoon of the 28th for treatment. It is said that he will need to undergo various surgeries to completely remove the shrapnel before he can recover.</p>
<p>There are Still Problems with the President of Mantetsu - The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reported that with Director-General Uchida about to assume the position of Foreign Minister, the government considers Vice President Hatta's promotion to president as the most likely option. However, because Hatta belongs to the Seiyukai party and has a strong political color, Mr. 井拓 is strongly opposed to it. He claims that Mantetsu is the lifeline of the empire, and if the new control mechanism is implemented, the position of president should still be selected from ministerial-level figures. Since Japan advocated the four-headed political control of Manchuria and Mongolia, the administrative power of the Mantetsu-affiliated territories will naturally be separated and become independent. Mantetsu will only become a pure railway company, so the authority of the Mantetsu president will inevitably be reduced, and there is a proposal to abolish the previous ministerial-level position.</p>
<p>Osaka Train Suddenly Shot At - The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that at 8:00 PM on the 28th of last month, the special express train from Osaka to Tokyo was suddenly fired upon several times from the east side of the railway when it passed the Kitano-dori intersection near Osaka Station. The bullets hit the central window of the second-class car, and the passengers were panicked, but no one was injured. The Sonezaki Police Station dispatched police to search everywhere, but the perpetrator had already fled far away, and the truth is still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>東北之謎Ｋ</h3>
<p>The Mystery of Northeast K</p>
<p>(The most necessary key to creating a new three-way continental situation) (Continued from the third part)</p>
<p>(Seven)</p>
<p>The Eastern Qing Railway, now known as the Chinese Eastern Railway, was transformed from Russian dictatorship to being jointly managed by China and Russia, according to the Sino-Russian and Fengtian-Russian agreements of the Republic of China in 1924. However, the administrative and economic powers remained in the hands of the Russians, with the Chinese only nominally involved. Japan, insatiably ambitious, took advantage of the opportunity of the break in diplomatic relations between China and Russia, and has been constantly active on this railway since the September 18th Incident. Russia, due to internal affairs and diplomatic relations, is unwilling to engage in direct conflict with Japan at this time, so it has shown silence and concession everywhere. As a result, Japan has become even more unscrupulous and has occupied Harbin. Since the establishment of the puppet state, it has forced the railway bureau to replace the flags with the flag of the puppet state, and then appointed Li Shaogeng as the director, Ili Chun as the deputy director, Shen Ruilin as the chief director, Fan Qiguang, Ai Naifang, and Jin Ronggui as directors, Zhang Shu as the chairman of the supervisory board, and Shao Lin as the supervisor. The command of the railway guard was reorganized with Xi Qia as the commander-in-chief, Yu Shen　as the deputy commander. The office in Panyang was moved to Changchun, secretly directed by the Japanese Ohashi Chuuichi. Ohashi has a reputation as a Russian expert and is the Japanese consul general in Harbin, also serving as the vice-minister of foreign affairs. However, the Russians are also very cunning and have long prepared for passive resistance. For example, 80% of the bureau's deposits of 11.75 million yuan were transferred to the Far East Bank and the Vladivostok Gosbank. Also, from January to March, vehicles and materials worth 40 million gold rubles were successively transported to the Ussuri road in Russia. All train account books from stations such as Manchuria, Hailar, and Suifenhe were also taken away. Although the Japanese ordered Zhang Shu to investigate in Suifenhe and ordered Li Shaokang to negotiate with the Russians, to this day, the Russians have not shown any intention of returning them, and have said that these vehicles were entirely purchased with Russian capital. Among the vehicles transported were 73 locomotives and 1,460 freight cars, so there is a sudden shortage of vehicles, and train service is greatly affected. Goods waiting to be transported are piled up like mountains at various stations. Merchants are naturally unable to complain, and at the same time, the railway bureau's business has plummeted. All employee salaries, starting in June, will reportedly be changed from gold rubles to Harbin taels to temporarily maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Currently, the Chinese directors have organized a special committee to recover the vehicles and request the deposits, and have formulated the following measures to protect property:</p>
<p>(1) All kinds of vehicles in the existing Eastern Railway General Factory, the materials stored in the General Materials Factory, and the vehicles and materials at various stations along the line shall be protected by the police responsible for each jurisdiction. When necessary, police shall be dispatched to monitor. If vehicles are transported out or materials are moved, permission must be requested from the railway police department, and the investigation bureau shall review it. If the reason is justified, a train can be dispatched; otherwise, it shall be stopped.</p>
<p>(2) If the investigation bureau proves that the vehicles are transported to other stations, the railway police at the departing station shall record the vehicle number and type, and report to this office. The office shall notify the arrival station to protect it and prevent external transportation.</p>
<p>(3) The vehicles used for transportation at each station must be investigated and approved by the railway police and the investigators at the station. If there is any improper conduct, the train shall not be dispatched.</p>
<p>(4) The police officers at each station's railway police station shall inspect the vehicle number and the number of materials when vehicles or materials are transported from other stations, so as to monitor the transfer.</p>
<p>(5) The stations of Manzhouli and Suifenhe are important national border crossings, and the railway police stations should pay special attention. If vehicles or materials are to leave the country, the chief of the investigation at the station and the Manchurian personnel of the employment system shall monitor and investigate before explaining to the stationmaster before departure is allowed; otherwise, it shall be stopped.</p>
<p>(6) The purpose of these measures is to protect railway property. The responsibility is heavy, and the railway police officers at each station must not be negligent in their duties; otherwise, they will be punished according to law.</p>
<p>The Japanese conspiracy regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway is that they are preparing to buy up Russian shares, or else they must use the name of entrusted management and change it to the North Manchuria Railway. However, the Russians believe that abandoning the Chinese Eastern Railway is no different from abandoning the Pacific, so the explosion of the Japanese army's victory vehicle was actually ordered by the Russian military department. With such mutual stimulation and turbulence, North Manchuria will eventually become a battlefield again one day. However, before their lives are endangered, the Russians seem prepared to let everything go, even to feign cooperation with the puppet state. Recently, the Japanese announced that the puppet state will hold a meeting with Russia in Harbin in July to discuss the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which may be for a reason.</p>
<p>(Eight) As for the transportation business other than the railway, it is also worth mentioning. The Japanese have now forced the Heilongjiang Provincial Government to sign an aviation transportation business contract, starting a pilot project for five years from March 1. One route goes from Harbin via Qiqihar to Manzhouli, with airports set up in Harbin and Manzhouli. The other route goes from Qiqihar via Nenjiang to Heihe, and from Heihe via Hailun to Harbin, with airports set up in Nenjiang, Heihe, and Hailun. Also, the Kanto Bureau of Communications of Japan and the Harbin Long-Distance Telephone Bureau have reached an agreement that direct calls between Harbin, Dalian, and Shenyang have already been opened on March 16. At the same time, the Bureau is also laying a direct telephone line between Osaka and Dalian at a cost of 200,000 yen, which is scheduled to begin in June and is expected to be open for communication next spring. The telephone between Tokyo and Shenyang is also being planned. In addition, the Osaka Shosen Kaisha has added a Dalian-Yokohama line in North China in addition to the Osaka-Dalian, Osaka-Tianjin, Yokohama-Tianjin, and Osaka-Qingdao lines, and the number of merchant ships has also been increased to six. It has also been agreed with the South Manchuria Railway Company that starting from April 1, trains will run to the pier every time a ship arrives in Dalian, so as to increase the convenience of passengers and freight. All of these are nothing more than making South Manchuria and North Manchuria, Manchuria and Japan, increasingly close and intimate. The military and economic value cannot be ignored.

<h3>粤省兩陳大戰伶仃洋</h3>
<p>The Great Battle of the Two Chens in Guangdong Province in the Lingdingyang Sea</p>
<p>Chen Jitang's Forces Attacking Hainan Island Number Eight Regiments - Guangzhou Correspondence: After Chen Jitang dispatched troops to drive away Chen Ce's small fleet at Tangjiawan, he decided to take a further step to attack Hainan Island.</p>
<p>In addition to the three independent regiments of Zhang Wentao, Liu Qishi, and Liang Guowu already having arrived outside Leizhou, the Second Army Training Regiment of Ye Minyu, stationed in Xinhui, and the Second Training Regiment of Liang Gongfu, which drove away the naval vessels at Tangjiawan, were also urgently dispatched to Leizhou. After receiving the order, the Ye and Liang regiments departed from their respective defense areas. It is said that the Liang regiment will serve as the vanguard for the attack on Hainan Island, and it is planned to use wooden rafts as large rafts to transport the army to attack Haikou and Puan and other places in Hainan Island. Recently, Chen Jitang also purchased the merchant ship Chaozhou, converted it into a warship, to prepare for the attack on Hainan Island. It is said that the ship was a former transport ship of a certain country, and it sails very fast. After Chen purchased it at a huge cost, he immediately converted it into an ironclad ship and installed gun emplacements. It is currently being repaired and outfitted in a certain port. The naval command has sent technicians to supervise the construction, and it is said that it will be out of the dock within days and sail to the southern route. In addition, the Guangjin and Haihu warships have also been ordered to assist in the attack on Hainan Island. In recent days, Chen has hired merchant ships to transport large quantities of firearms, ammunition, aircraft fuel, and anti-aircraft guns to the front of the southern route for combat reserves. On June 22, he hired the Dongtai merchant ship, which travels between the provincial capital and Shuidong, to transport a large second batch of military supplies to the southern route. As for the commander of the attack on Hainan Island, Chen Zhangfu, initially planned to take advantage of the ship's trip to Leizhou to command everything, but was forced to turn back due to obstacles. On the 23rd, he changed to traveling by plane. He arrived safely in Leizhou that afternoon. It is said that if Chen Zhangfu had not changed to traveling by plane this time, he would have been in danger of being captured by the enemy, because Chen Ce's fleet had already been deployed outside Lingdingyang, determined to intercept any merchant ships passing by. When the Dongtai ship left the port on the 22nd, it was indeed intercepted by Chen Ce's Zhongshan warship, and the entire ship was thoroughly searched. It was very strict, and because it was discovered that Chen Zhangfu was taking advantage of the ship's departure, the purpose was to search for Chen Zhangfu. However, the search did not find Chen Zhangfu, and finally a large batch of military supplies on the ship was seized. Chen Jitang, upon hearing the report, regarded Chen Ce's fleet rampaging on the sea as a thorn in his side, and on the 24th ordered the air force command to rush to send planes to Lingdingyang to destroy the fleet. That evening, Huang Guangrui and the air force team members discussed and on the morning of the 25th, the first team's deputy Hu Qixuan and squad leader Lin Zuo were sent to take off to reconnoiter. After about an hour, they returned to report that there were more than ten ships of Chen Ce's fleet concentrated in Lingdingyang, with the Zhongshan and Jianru ships serving as cover. Huang Guangrui then ordered the first team leader, , to lead several fighter jets such as the Kesa, Yigu, and Xinyangcheng, carrying heavy bombs, to bomb them. In the afternoon, they flew back and reported that after the enemy ships in Lingdingyang were bombed by planes, they dared not anchor in the same place and had sailed into the territorial waters of Hong Kong. It is said that the enemy's flagship was hit and injured in this battle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that in the battle of Lingdingyang on the 25th, Chen Ce's fleet was commanded by the Zhongshan warship. Chen Jitang first sent the first aircraft team's Yangcheng and Kesa aircraft to take off in the morning, piloted by deputy team leader Hu Qixuan, squad leader Lin Zuo, and pilots Fan Shaoping and Liu Huan. At noon, the first aircraft team leader, , led two Yigu and Jialuhua aircraft to assist in the battle. At that time, the ships on the Lingdingyang sea surface were firing anti-aircraft guns, and artillery positions were also set up on the mountains on the sea surface, fiercely attacking the attacking aircraft. The aircraft mostly threw bombs at the Zhongshan warship, as it was Chen Ce's main warship, but none of them hit. Only one bomb hit the stern of the Zhixin warship. The aircraft and ships fought in the air for about forty minutes, and the bombs dropped were also exhausted. They immediately flew back to report. On the morning of the 26th, at about 6:00 AM, Chen Jitang again sent four fighter jets to Lingdingyang to bomb the fleet there. The battle was still led by the first squadron leader, Tan Shou. The Zhongshan warship also fired anti-aircraft guns in retaliation. At about 8:00 AM, the aircraft team began to return. At 12:00 noon, they flew again to bomb. Bombs rained down, and the bombing lasted for about sixty minutes before the aircraft retreated. The naval and air forces fought fiercely on this day, even more fiercely than the battle on the 25th. It is said that a certain warship wanted to sail directly to the provincial river to pursue the attack, and telegraphed Chen Ce for instructions. Chen stopped the movement of the warships, believing that the time had not yet come, and only ordered the small warships to sail to Baiers Bay near Hong Kong and Baoan to anchor. There were British warships anchoring there, so the British and Chinese warships were mixed together, so that the aircraft team did not dare to recklessly throw bombs. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 26th, most of Chen Ce's warships sailed to Baiers Bay, and the battle of Lingdingyang also became more moderate. (June 28)</p>
<h3>汕頭海口燈塔復光</h3>
<p>The Shantou Seaport Lighthouse Restored</p>
<p>Formerly Extinguished Temporarily to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Pay Attention to US Warship Exercises</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred, Japanese warships provoked Shantou, using lights to illuminate our military and political agencies, and interfered with the opinions of various newspapers, claiming that they would send sailors to land on March 1 to threaten us. At that time, Zhang Ruigui, the commander of the Second Independent Division stationed in Shantou, and all his troops were extremely indignant, so they extinguished the Dezhou two lighthouses outside Mayu Port, placed naval mines, and declared maritime martial law. The time for ships to enter and exit the port was now fixed. All foreign ships entering and leaving the port of Shantou must report to the municipal government in advance; otherwise, we would not be responsible. Sandbags were piled up at various important road intersections on the shore for strict defense. At that time, the Third Army also rushed from the land route of eastern Guangdong. The Japanese warships automatically cancelled the proposal to land sailors. However, since the signing of the Shanghai Truce Agreement, the situation has gradually eased. The British consul stationed in Shantou requested our government to extend the time for ships to enter and exit the port. Our side immediately agreed, changing it to allow ships to enter and exit Mayu Port from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM every day. Afterwards, as the situation continued to ease, someone suggested to the municipal government to restore the three lighthouses outside the seaport to facilitate navigation. The municipal government then submitted it to the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office for inspection. The Eastern District Commissioner's Office approved the prior restoration of the Dezhou and other lighthouses, as they were related to the navigation of merchant ships. Therefore, the lights have been restored since the 26th.</p>
<p>The US warships Rongli and Huoyishi and others stationed in Shantou will be conducting maritime combat technology exercises outside the port of Shantou from June 27 to July 10. They will sail out of the port of Shantou every morning and return to the Shantou fleet in the evening. The US consul formally sent a letter to the municipal government, which was forwarded to the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office. The Eastern District Commissioner's Office ordered the naval mine team outside Mayu Port to inform them. However, there is also a Japanese warship in the port of Shantou. During the US warship exercises, one or two more Japanese warships may increase their travel between Shantou and Xiamen, probably to pay attention to the movements of the US warships.</p>
<h3>Disturbances by Local Troops in Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>Wang Zuqing, a brigade commander under Zhang Zhen, has been executed by firing squad in Fuzhou. Following the arrival of the 19th Route Army's Mao Weisou and Shen Guanghan divisions in southern Fujian, the people of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou urgently requested the resolution of the issue of undisciplined local troops. The Military Affairs Commission also telegraphed orders to the military commanders, stating that pacifying the local areas of Fujian Province should begin with the disbandment of irregular troops. As a result, the various local troops felt very uneasy. Chen Guohui, commander of the First Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, was the first to withdraw from Quanzhou City and Tong'an County, relocating to Yongchun, Dehua, and Anxi. These three counties are characterized by overlapping mountains and strategic terrain. Since the founding of the Republic of China, they have served as bases for civilian armies and are also Chen Guohui's old stronghold. Currently, Yongchun is the center, with heavy troops stationed there, setting up defenses at key points. In Dehua, laborers are being conscripted to build fifteen city wall fortifications. Nine of these have already been completed. Furthermore, a military road, thirty li in length, is being constructed from Dehua County to Chishui. Construction began on June 16th, with a deadline for completion and trafficability on the 25th. Approximately 2,000 people are working on each segment daily. The local population is extremely busy with Chen's troops planning their defenses. Speculation is rife, with widespread rumors that Chen's troops will clash with the 19th Route Army. Mao Weisou specifically issued a notice to quell the rumors, stating that the 19th Route Army and the friendly forces in Quanzhou Prefecture are united in eradicating the communists, and the people should not be misled by rumors and cause mutual alarm. Furthermore, the 49th Division under Zhang Zhen is also preparing to withdraw from Zhangzhou City and relocate to Yunxiao and Zhao'an due to strong popular opposition, allowing Shen Guanghan's division to be stationed in Zhangzhou City. Wang Zuqing, the brigade commander of Zhang's division, previously failed to lead his troops to the aid of Longyan when it was invaded by communist bandits, missing the opportunity for military action. This led to the loss of contact between the defense lines of Shizhong, Shuichao, and Hexi. In the Battle of Tianbao, he again deserted before fighting, abandoning his troops and fleeing, resulting in the successive fall of Nan'an and Longxi. Knowing that he would face severe punishment, he fled to the Gulangyu concession in Xiamen. Unexpectedly, on the 21st, he returned to the province from Xiamen, hoping to use his influence. He secretly resided in the Degui Lane within the city. The provincial government discovered this, and on the 22nd, ordered the martial law headquarters to dispatch a team to arrest him. On the 23rd, the provincial government telegraphed Beijing for instructions on how to handle the situation. The various county associations from Zhangzhou residing in the provincial capital also requested that he be executed on the spot as a warning. On the morning of the 28th, the provincial government received a reply from the Military Affairs Commission, approving the execution according to law. Consequently, at 5:00 PM, the martial law department was ordered to carry out the execution. After receiving the order, the department interrogated him at 6:00 PM, and at 7:45 PM, he was escorted to the department's drill ground and executed by firing squad. He died instantly from a bullet to the head. The Security Bureau also dispatched Liu Yingcheng and Cheng Shichun to supervise the execution. Wang, whose given name was Chengyun, graduated from the third class of the Baoding Military Academy. He was 42 years old and had parents living in his hometown of Fu'an County, a wife, two concubines, and a seven-year-old son. During the execution, his wife</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Zhu Ruqing and Liu bid him farewell at the execution ground. Wang instructed them to support his parents and raise his son. The provincial government's statement of Wang's crimes is recorded below: "Upon investigation, when communist bandits invaded Zhangzhou, Wang Chengyun, the former brigade commander of the 49th Division of the Army, was ordered to serve as the commander of the central district. He consistently feared the enemy and failed to advance, his troops were disorganized, and his deployment was inadequate. As a result, the bandits who failed to breach our left district shifted their attack to the central district, breaking through immediately. At that time, the battle in the right district was still advantageous, and Division Commander Zhang was launching a final counterattack in the Chapu Wushiting area. If the former brigade commander had taken immediate action to remedy the situation at this time, the overall situation could have been salvaged. However, he abandoned his troops and fled into Zhangzhou City, causing the entire front to suffer and the entire division to collapse. This Chairman personally went to southern Fujian to suppress the communist bandits and investigate the circumstances of Zhangzhou's fall. It is clear that the former brigade commander had failed to provide adequate training, was avaricious and cowardly, and deserted before fighting, causing millions of people in Zhangzhou Prefecture to suffer. His crimes are deserving of punishment. The situation was reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who approved the enforcement of the law. A telegram was received from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: 'Execute according to law, approval granted, etc.' This must be followed accordingly. The former brigade commander Wang Chengyun is to be executed by firing squad as a warning. In addition to reporting to the higher authorities, all military and civilian personnel are to be informed." (June 29th)</p>
<h3>Wan Guobin's Account of the Heilongjiang Incident</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping: When Heilongjiang Province fell, there were widespread rumors that Wan Guobin had absconded with a large sum of money. Wan's own account of the Heilongjiang Incident is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Heilongjiang Province is located in a remote border region. The incident occurred suddenly, and various rumors circulated. Now that the incident has passed and the situation has changed, the truth may not have been revealed. Therefore, I will disclose what I witnessed and experienced at that time, which is what the people of the country want to hear. After the September 18th Incident, Japanese forces extended their influence to Jilin in the north. They reorganized the new government, and a Public Security Maintenance Committee was established in Harbin. At that time, Wan Fulin, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, was far away in Beiping. Guobin and the provincial committee members jointly shouldered the responsibility of maintaining provincial affairs. The Japanese and Harbin sides repeatedly sent people to induce and pressure us, telling us that if we followed the example of Harbin, we would be assigned the position of chairman of the Maintenance Committee. All these overtures were sternly rejected. Before long, Japanese troops suddenly arrived in Taonan. A certain garrison commander in Taonan, claiming to have been coerced by the Japanese, sent someone to say that he wanted to move his defense to Jiang Province to jointly resist foreign aggression. Considering that the country was facing a crisis, we should work together to resist the enemy, and we did not immediately refuse firmly. Later, we learned that the background of the Taonan army was the Japanese army. To prevent this, we burned the Jiangqiao Bridge to block their advance. At that time, Chairman Ma was ordered to come to the province to assume office, and Guobin assisted him in every way. Chairman Ma declared that he was ordered to come to Jiang this time to defend the territory, and any invaders would be resisted with force. The Taonan side then sent an envoy to Jiang, stating that there was no animosity between the two sides, but the Japanese found it difficult to tolerate Wan in Jiang. If he could leave the province to another location, it might ease the situation, and the Taonan army would not go to Jiang. Guobin thought that since the other party had made such a statement, it would be very good if he could avoid war by leaving. Therefore, he went to Harbin temporarily on the orders of Chairman Ma. However, he always tried his best in the military and political affairs of Jiang Province and never dared to slack off. When the provincial government retreated to Hailun, he rushed to Chairman Ma overnight to ask to stay in Hailun and work. However, at that time, Chairman Ma had a proposal for Jiang and Harbin to compromise in order to cope with the situation. The Harbin authorities frequently complained about Guobin being in Hailun. At the same time, Japanese representatives came and went constantly, making it difficult to stay for long. Therefore, he went to Heihe on the orders of Chairman Ma. After arriving in Heihe, he often made statements to the authorities regarding military and political affairs and foreign affairs. When Ding Li's volunteer army rose up in Harbin, Chairman Ma telegraphed the people of the province to rise up and go to the rescue together. Guobin immediately sent a telegram in response, requesting to serve the country himself. The telegram said: 'Respected Uncle Xiuweng, Chairman Ma of Hailun, Confidential: I have read the Dongri telegram, which clarifies righteousness and inspires people. All nationals cannot but be moved. Since the Shenyang Incident, I have been uniting comrades internally and dealing with the enemy externally, determined to die unyielding. I had long ago made a decision, but I did not dare to act rashly because the government's policy was unclear. I then heard the supreme plan in Binjiang and immediately returned to the province to face the national crisis. Later, due to Taonan's statement that my stay or departure was a condition for reconciliation, I had to temporarily avoid it to block their excuses. However, I have never dared to slack off in carrying out the affairs of Jiang Province as long as I can. After the provincial government moved to Hailun, I once presented my sincerity and wanted to serve the country myself. At that time, I was negotiating between Harbin and Japan, so it was not convenient to stay and attract attention. Therefore, I came here on orders to observe the development of the situation. Now that the national government's foreign policy has been announced to the world, and Your Excellency is leading the people of the province to resist together, I am a civil servant in this province and the nephew of Your Excellency. In terms of public duty, I should be an enemy to all, and in terms of personal feelings, I should be in urgent need. If I were to indulge in ease and not rise up immediately, how could I thank the people of the province, and how could I face my own conscience? I would like to rush forward to exert my strength to serve as a driver and to show my long-standing aspirations to serve the country and to repay the kindness of my elders. I am ready to go and await orders with trepidation, Your Nephew Wan Guobin.' After this telegram was sent, Chairman Ma replied that the Harbin army had withdrawn and could not be of service this time. If there was an opportunity in the future, he would be able to reach it again. Later, the general situation changed drastically, and the new regime was being brewed. Therefore, he and the Heihe Consul telegraphed Chairman Ma to be cautious about the matter. The telegram said: 'Chairman Ma of the Hailun Military Office, I have heard that Your Excellency has been reassigned as the Administrative Director, and there is a rumor that you will return to the province on the 21st to take office. Shi'en has always loved and admired Your Excellency. I believe that Your Excellency's move is not your intention. I am especially concerned that the war will be involved and the local area will be destroyed. I have to preserve my strength and wait for the opportunity. However, Shi'en and others privately believe that the reputation that Your Excellency has enjoyed for several months should not be sacrificed lightly, and the move to change to a new position in the province should not be done lightly. If Your Excellency does not take office in the province, no matter how you deal with it, the people of the country will be able to understand Your Excellency, and Your Excellency will also have room to advance and retreat. If Your Excellency takes office in the province, you will inevitably fall into a difficult situation. The Japanese are not sincere in their support of Your Excellency. Now that Your Excellency is temporarily staying in Hailun, they still have some scruples. Once you take office in the province, you will inevitably be forced to accept all kinds of threats. Our strength will gradually be eliminated by them, and the rights and interests of Jiang Province will gradually be taken away by them. If we want to preserve our strength, we will not be able to preserve our strength in the end. If we want to cherish the local area, the local area will be ruined because of this. How will the people of the country comment on Your Excellency, and how will Your Excellency feel the pain? As a result, you will not be understood by the people of the country, nor will you be tolerated by the Japanese. Your Excellency's hard work and efforts over the past few months will be in vain. Is this not a painful thing? Now, in the overall situation of the Northeast, there is only one corner of Jiang Province left. If the government is still in Hailun, it can still preserve its current name. In the eyes of foreigners, the Northeast has not yet been lost, and there are still ways to recover it. If you change to a new position in the province, the overall situation in the Northeast will be lost. This is a matter of Your Excellency's behavior and the relationship between the Northeast Province. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, foreigners have had very bad feelings towards Japan. Your Excellency's personal character has won the praise of foreigners. The reputation of our Chinese nation has increased because of this. If we ask ourselves to be conquered, the international status of our country will be greatly affected. This is a matter of Your Excellency's behavior and the relationship with the entire nation. Shi'en and others are thinking about Your Excellency's personal character, the future of Jiang Province, the overall situation of the Northeast, and the Chinese nation. At this critical juncture of success or failure, I urge Your Excellency to be cautious. The ancients said, 'A single slip may cause a lasting sorrow.' I urge you to think about it carefully. In addition, all the twists and turns of the situation cannot be explained in detail in the text. It is proposed to publicly recommend Shi'en to go to Hailun to present the case in person. If Your Excellency is willing to listen to it, please postpone your entry into the province so that I can express my foolishness and help with the fine flow. I am extremely eager to await orders, Your Brother Quan Shi'en, Chief of Staff Qi Zhaoyu, Chief of Staff Cui Boshan, Nephew Wan Guobin, Son Kui respectfully kowtow.' After this telegram was sent, it was learned that Chairman Ma had scheduled to return to the province, and he felt that the general situation was hopeless. Chairman Ma then sent someone to inform him and ordered Guobin to travel abroad. He went to Russia on March 1st, then to Germany, and then to Italy. The situation of the inspections in all the countries he passed through will be published in detail in the future. However, at this time of national crisis, as a national, he could not seek ease and comfort for himself. After a long period of wandering, he came to Ping to seek self-reliance. He only knew how to serve the country. Since the incident, he has never avoided danger. Unfortunately, due to environmental constraints, he has not been able to achieve his goals. He is very sorry. Although he is now a Fumin, he is driven by his conscience and will not hesitate to serve the country, even if he goes through fire and water. (To be continued)"</p>
<h3>Li Haiqing's Family Members Captured by Rebel Troops</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Dalian: General Li Haiqing, who fought bravely against Japan in northern Manchuria with Ma Zhanshan, recently retreated from Anda Station to Lanxi due to the fierce attack by the Japanese army on the Middle East Road. He then gathered more than 10,000 righteous soldiers in the Qinggang area, preparing to counterattack Anda in the near future. However, when Li was retreating to Qinggang, 400 troops led by his subordinate Feng Guangyou were bought by the Japanese and suddenly rebelled, capturing Li's family members, including his first wife, Madam Li, his second wife, Madam Cui, his eldest daughter, Li Huiying (17 years old), and his eldest son, Li Laifu (3 years old). The rebel troops sent them to the capital of Heilongjiang Province, where they will be dealt with by the puppet governor Cheng Zhiyuan. The second wife is currently held in the Heihe Army Prison. The first wife and children have been suffering from fatigue from military service for several months, resulting in serious illnesses. They have been sent to the local public hospital for treatment (June 28th).</p>
<h3>The Organization of Communist Bandits on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border</h3>
<p>The bandit leaders are Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping</p>
<p>He Yingqin has ordered the divisions to encircle and suppress them</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang: The largest groups of communist bandits on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border are those of Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping. Fang Zhimin was originally a student expelled from the Provincial Industrial School and the Second Middle School. In 1927, he served as an executive member of the Kuomintang Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters and the Chairman of the Farmers' Committee. After the Ninghan Cooperation, Fang sneaked back to his native Yiyang and engaged in communist activities in the Mopan Mountain area at the junction of Yi and Heng and the Qigong Town area at the junction of Yi and De. Initially, he had only a few rifles and two Mauser pistols. Later, he and Shao Shiping, Zou Qi, and other groups incited peasants, recruited deserters, and seized firearms from nearby garrison troops and local defense forces, forming a force. Over the years, military suppression failed, and Fang acquired many guns, thus rampaging through the border areas of Jiangxi and Zhejiang. The recent organization of the bandits is subordinate to the Fake Chinese Communist Party Executive Committee established by Zhu De and Mao Zedong. Its highest organ is the Jiangxi-Northeast Farmers' and Workers' Revolutionary Committee. The fake central representatives are Hong Yixun and Shao Shiping. The fake Chairman of the Central Jiangxi-Northeast Committee is Fang Zhimin. The fake Chairman of the Provincial Committee is Wan Yongchengcheng. The fake Chairman of the Military Committee is Tang Gang. Eight Communist Party District Committees have been established in the counties of Yujiang, Guixi, Leping, Dexing, Wannian, Shangrao, Hengfeng, and Yiyang in eastern Jiangxi. The bandits recently planned to develop northward from the Xinjiang River Basin and established secret agencies in Jinxi, Zixi, and Qianshan counties in the hope of expanding the red area. Under the Fake Military Commission, there is Zhou Jianping's Fake Tenth Army. This army has a total of three regiments, each regiment having six companies, and each company having 72 guns. In addition, each District Committee (i.e., one county) has one guard regiment. With eight districts, there are a total of more than 1,700 guns. The two groups of Zou Qi and Huang Dao in Qianshan are called the Independent Guard Division, with about 1,000 guns. There are a total of about 5,000 guns, eight machine guns, and three mortars. The bandit bases are in Dexing, Hengfeng, Yiyang, Guixi, and other counties. Nearby counties are semi-bandit areas. The bandits sometimes enter Fujian, sometimes flee to Anhui, and sometimes disturb Zhejiang. More than 20 counties within the Xinjiang and Raohe rivers are even more irrelevant. According to news from the front, the bandit's fake central government is located in Hengfeng, where the bandit leaders Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping are stationed. Ordnance factories, military schools, and farmers' banks are located in Geyuan, Hengfeng. It is heard that there are 500 workers in the ordnance factory, but the air force has reported that the factory has been bombed and destroyed. It is heard that He Yingqin has ordered Zhou Hunyuan's division to concentrate in Guixi, Wang Jinwen's division to concentrate in Qianshan, Zhao Guantao's division to concentrate in Shangrao, and Zhang's brigade of Li Yunheng's division to concentrate in Wannian Dexing to advance into the bandits' base areas. Therefore, the bandits retreated into the mountains of Hengfeng and Dexing in an attempt to resist stubbornly, and coerced the people into the mountains. The bandit suppression army is wary of the retreat, so the progress is slightly delayed (June 30th).</p>
<h3>Wuhu Merchant Ship Robbed Again</h3>
<p>Merchant ships robbed five times in more than a month A dispatch from Wuhu: Leaving aside the incidents of merchant ships operating in various places in Wuhu being robbed in the past, if we calculate only the most recent month or so, there have been as many as five robberies. The Wuhu-Datong route has been robbed four times, which is shocking. On June 30th, the Sheng Company's ship left Datong with passengers at 8:00 AM. It was attacked and robbed by bandits on the Yangshan section of the river. It was found that there were only six bandits, who hid their pistols inside their long gowns and pretended to be passengers boarding the ship. When the ship reached Yangshan Reef, there were fewer ships coming and going. The bandits pulled out their pistols and ordered the ship to stop. At the same time, they guarded the cabin doors, preventing anyone from entering or leaving, and then searched the ship. After twenty minutes, they fired a shot to summon the bandit ship to take the loot and then fled into the territory of Tongling County. The ship suffered losses of about a thousand yuan. During the robbery, the bandits kept firing their guns to show off, causing a refugee surnamed Nie from Dangtu, who was in the cabin, to be accidentally hit in the back by a bullet, which passed through his chest. The bandits even gave him ten yuan for medical expenses, which can be said to be taking other people's lives. The ship arrived in Wuhu at 2:00 PM. Mr. Nie went to Yijishan Hospital for treatment, but he died of his injuries soon after.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province's Tightening and Administration</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Anqing: Anhui Province's finances are extremely strained. Since the floods last year, the province's income has fallen into a difficult situation. The provincial government is adopting a austerity policy, drastically reducing various administrative agencies in order to maintain the status quo. It has now been decided that from July 1st, before the budget for the 21st year is established, all agencies, except for those that should be discussed and reduced separately and those that do not have a large increase compared with the old and new budgets, will temporarily apply for a reduction in accordance with the original budget. The remaining agencies will be reduced according to the previous year's budget, and the remaining amount will be paid. This will reduce approximately more than 1.33 million yuan annually.

<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Petition to Abolish the Self-Government Household Levy: Since Xiaoshan implemented the village and neighborhood system in the 18th year, after the establishment of village and neighborhood councils, a self-government household levy was created. Households were investigated and forced to pay levies, ranging from one yuan to nineteen or twenty yuan. The burden on the people became heavier and heavier, and complaints filled the air. After the establishment of the district office, collection agents were openly sent to the countryside to collect household levies, and their collection was even more urgent than that of land taxes. However, self-government work has not been realized at all. The previous county representatives' assembly had already proposed abolishing the levy, but it has not yet been implemented. This time, the people have again petitioned the province to abolish the self-government household levy in order to maintain the people's livelihoods and reduce township expenses, thereby lightening the burden on households. It is unknown how the provincial authorities will rule on this.</p>

Seeing that he had caused trouble, Ahu fled without a trace. That evening, the Zhang family hired thugs to beat Zheng's eight-year-old child to death with wooden sticks. Both sides have reported the matter to the county for investigation. It is unknown how this murder case will be resolved.</p>

<p>Important Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Dissolves National Central University</h3>
<p>National Central University to Conduct Periodic Student Review: Nanjing, 4th – The president of National Central University issued a notice on the 4th, stating, "By order of the Ministry of Education, which in turn received instructions from the Executive Yuan, students are to undergo immediate re-evaluation." Following this order, a notice has been issued. The evaluation will take place from August 20th to 25th. With the exception of a small number of disruptive individuals who will be punished separately, all students are required to return to the university by August 20th to await evaluation. The evaluation methods will be published in the "Jing Central Daily," "Shanghai Shenbao," and "Tianjin Dagongbao" before the 20th of this month. Please take note.</p>
<p>Five Groups and Two Colleges Have Been Taken Over: Nanjing, 4th – The secretary section chief dispatched by the Ministry of Education to take over National Central University has already taken over the Accounting, Documentation, Registration, Publishing, and General Affairs Groups, as well as the Agricultural and Law Colleges. The Education, Arts &amp; Sciences, and Engineering Colleges have not yet been taken over and are being temporarily managed.</p>
<p>Students Request to Stay in Dorms: Nanjing, 4th – Students of National Central University have submitted a petition to the university and the Ministry of Education, stating that since the few students suspected of causing trouble have been arrested and are being dealt with according to the law, there is no reason to implicate the entire student body and subject them to the misery of dissolution. They request permission to remain in their original dormitories, or to be concentrated in one dormitory, with continued provision of water and electricity, so that they will not be left homeless.</p>
<p>Notice from National Central University Students: On the 4th, representatives went to the Ministry of Education and the university for discussions. Because there was no one in charge, it was not possible to obtain a firm reply. However, according to both parties, no other measures will be taken before a relief plan is in place. It is hoped that the students remaining on campus will remain calm.</p>
<p>Notice from National Central University Students: The preliminary demands of the students are: first, students who cannot leave the university should still be allowed to live in their original dormitories, with continued provision of water and electricity; second, if they cannot live in their original dormitories, the university should designate dormitories and not stop the supply of water and electricity.</p>
<p>Statement by Liang Jikang: This newspaper received a letter from Liang Jikang yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed editor, I respectfully inform you that I recently read a news item in the education news column of your newspaper on the 1st of this month, titled 'Reasons for National Central University Students' Rejection of Duan,' which contains the following passage: '...At that time, Mr. Duan saw students yelling and hitting, and bravely tried to grab the yellers. The other students, feeling it was unfair, all started to fight, causing him to be severely beaten. According to students who witnessed the incident, if Mr. Duan had retreated when he saw the opportunity, the beating would not have occurred. After the beating, if Mr. Duan had not tried to pull people, he would not have been injured so badly...' This account does not correspond to the actual situation at the time. On the morning of the 29th of last month, at 8:30 AM, I accompanied Acting President Duan in Education Ministry vehicle number 213 to National Central University. Acting President Duan was in the president's office, talking with Mr. Cha Qian, the university's dean of academic affairs, when we heard shouts from the direction of the sports field. I opened the back door of the president's office and saw hundreds of students rushing towards the former Nangaoyuan, shouting and yelling. I knew that the students were about to make a move, so I returned to the president's office. At this time, Mr. Cha Qian was no longer there. I asked Duan to take temporary shelter, but Duan said there was nowhere to take temporary shelter. At this time, the sounds of smashing cars and shouting abuse at the Nangaoyuan gate became more serious. I went out the front door of the president's office and saw that the students downstairs had surrounded the Nangaoyuan gate. More than 30 students had rushed upstairs, looking for Acting President Duan and asking who Duan Xipeng was. Duan immediately stood in the doorway of the president's office and identified himself. Before he could finish speaking, more than ten students rushed forward, grabbed him, and dragged him downstairs. Near the staircase, dozens more students rushed up and began to beat Duan. Duan, squeezed into the crowd, had no chance to resist and could only be beaten. When he was dragged to the Nangaoyuan gate, his blue crepe robe was torn to shreds. Duan was being beaten and pushed back and forth. I personally saw two strong students rush out of the crowd and violently knock Duan to the ground, then continue to kick and punch him. At this time, most of the students were clapping and cheering. Seeing that Mr. Duan's life was in danger, I stepped forward to help him, but because I was weak, a student in a white robe forcefully pulled me away. Fortunately, I was not punched. It was also fortunate that there were armed campus police standing at the west gate of the university, and a campus police officer with a leather belt was standing next to them, but they both watched without interfering. I begged them to help, but they just shook their heads. Later, I saw students throw Duan out the west gate, and a student in a blue cotton robe slammed the west gate shut. I did not leave Acting President Duan's side during this entire incident and witnessed the situation. If Duan had intended to grab the yellers or pull people, why would he not have informed the police beforehand? This is very clear. Furthermore, it was I, Liang Jikang, who accompanied Duan to the university that day, not Education Ministry Secretary Sha Menghai. Please correct this and publish this letter in the education news column of your newspaper. With best regards, Liang Jikang, 7/2."</p>

<p>Hao stated in a speech when leaving Beiping that there were two motivations for his advocating sending both Yu and Liu to participate in the World Games: (1) The strength of various countries in the World Games is not the main concern. From an international perspective, our country is too backward, and we should have found ways to participate in the games earlier. (2) Japan is even using our country's athletes as representatives of the puppet state to register with the games to promote the puppet state, making it easier for countries around the world to recognize it. This time, our country has an athlete participating, which can break this despicable means of the Japanese, etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Changchun is in great spirits. Liu Changchun is in great spirits and will be accompanied by coach Song Junfu. It is said that they will arrive in San Francisco on the 27th. Mr. Liu and Song have already printed a kind of card with the Temple of Heaven as the cover, with pictures of the two gentlemen inside, and attached English greetings. They will distribute them at the games to connect with young people around the world.</p>
<p>Tonight, a reception for newspaper reporters and athlete representatives. It is scheduled for 7 PM tonight at the YMCA restaurant to host newspaper reporters, to report on the motivation for this initiative, the preparation process, and other various matters. Liu will also express his views at that time. Tomorrow night, Xie Jin Hui will host a banquet to welcome them and bid them farewell.</p>
<p>Four significances of participating in the games. Remarks made while passing through Jinan. Jinan, 3rd. Hao Gengsheng, Gao Zi, Liu Changchun, and Northeast University professor Song Junfu passed through Jinan today on their way to Shanghai. Liu and Song are scheduled to take the Mess Kai Lun to the United States on the 8th to participate in the World Games. Hao is participating in the National Sports Conference. Hao discussed the significance of this participation: (1) To prevent the Manchurian puppet state from participating and gaining a position in the international arena. (2) Liu is from the Northeast and can take the opportunity to promote to the world's youth the Japanese invasion of our Northeast and the truth about the puppet state. (3) To open a new era in our country's sports history, allowing the national flag to fly over the world's sports field for the first time. (4) To aim to observe various countries and promote our country's sports. Victory or defeat is not the goal. Yu Xiwei is in Dalian, being monitored by the Japanese and unable to go. Liu discussed his motivation for participating to prevent the puppet state from participating and to report the truth about the Northeast to the world's youth. However, my results are too far behind. My goal is sightseeing. I am reporting for the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 400-meter events. My times are 11 seconds for the 100-meter, 22 seconds for the 200-meter, and 53 seconds for the 400-meter. Song discussed that 8,000 yuan was donated for participation expenses. Arriving on the 29th, the meeting will be held on the 30th. Liu's 100-meter preliminary round is at 3 PM on the 31st, the 200-meter on the 2nd, and the 400-meter on the 4th.</p>
<p>A glimpse of Liu Changchun's records</p>
<p>The 14th North China Games. Liu Changchun first attended a large-scale sports meeting, the 14th North China Games held in PanYang at the end of May and the beginning of June in 1929. At that time, Liu won the championships in the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 400-meter events, and all the results broke the national records. The 100-meter was 10.4 seconds, the 200-meter was 21.4 seconds, and the 400-meter was 52.4 seconds. Liu's reputation spread throughout the country at that time.</p>
<p>China-Japan-Germany Joint Games. In the late autumn of 1929, a China-Japan-Germany international对抗competition was held in Shenyang. Liu participated in the 100-meter and 200-meter events and won the championships again. The 100-meter maintained the highest record of 10.4 seconds, and the 200-meter showed even more progress, taking only 21.6 seconds. This was Liu's golden age.</p>
<p>Hangzhou National Games. In 1930, the National Games were held in Hangzhou. Southern people were able to admire Mr. Liu's demeanor at that time. In the National Games, Liu still maintained the three championships, but the 100-meter results greatly declined, with a time of 11.4 seconds, the 200-meter was 22.4 seconds, and the 400-meter was 52.4 seconds.</p>
<p>9th Far Eastern Games. After the Hangzhou National Games, Mr. Liu was selected to attend the 9th Far Eastern Games. He first stayed and trained with the athletes in Shanghai, but Liu suddenly had a leg problem at that time, so he could not play in the Shanghai Sino-American对抗sports, which greatly disappointed the Shanghai enthusiastic audience who wanted to appreciate Mr. Liu's skills. When he went to Japan to participate in the Far Eastern Games, his leg problem had not yet recovered, so he gave up the 100-meter and 200-meter events and only participated in the 400-meter. He ran fourth in the preliminary round and was eliminated.</p>
<p>15th North China Games. Last year, the 15th North China Games were held in Jinan. Mr. Liu won the championships in the 100-meter and 400-meter events, but the results still declined without progress. He gave up the 200-meter and did not compete. At that time, Mr. Liu was still suffering from a leg problem, and he was wearing wide and thick leggings. His 100-meter time was 11.4 seconds, and his 400-meter time was 54.3 seconds.</p>
<p>Performance results this year. This year, Mr. Liu has not participated in formal competitions, but only in informal对抗sports. He originally joined the Beiping City Games in mid-May, but he withdrew due to diarrhea. On May 10th, the Northeast Sports College (that is, Liu's undergraduate) and Fu Jen University对抗in Beiping, and Liu ran the 100-meter with a time of 11.2 seconds. On May 29th, the Far East track and field team对抗in Tianjin, and Liu ran the 200-meter in just 22 seconds, breaking his own record again.</p>

<p>Sayings of the 93-year-old Ma Xiangbo</p>
<h3>Domestic Flowers Become Wild Flowers</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>1872 was the year of the birth of Shen Bao. At that time, the academic style of the world was undergoing a major change. Darwin's "Origin of Species" had already been published in 1859. At that time, Japanese students who returned from Germany were determined to imitate the West, setting up the Ministry of Education and clarifying the academic system, which was the beginning of the Meiji Restoration. At that time, the Japanese imitated the West blindly, liking novelty but not being practical. Those who were curious about Darwin's works were delighted to see them, so they translated them and promoted them greatly. Mr. Yan Youling also translated Huxley's "Evolution and Ethics." Huxley can be regarded as being in the same tune as Darwin. Yan Youling used his flowery writing style to translate "Evolution and Ethics" into text that resembled Buddhist scriptures, arousing blind worship among the general public. In fact, the translation of the three characters of "Evolution and Ethics" is already wrong, because if it is really "Evolution", there is a Creator in the dark, which is completely opposite to the so-called mechanical theory of evolution.</p>
<p>According to the theory of evolution, species evolve from inferior to superior, from rough to refined. But domestic flowers are not cultivated, so why do they become wild flowers? Here, we only see "degeneration" and not "evolution", so the three characters of "evolution" are also wrong and should be translated as "theory of change". But even if it is "change", it is by no means something that living things can control themselves. The growth and decline of living things can never go beyond their nature, and grafting and turning wild flowers into domestic flowers are all promoted by artificial means, not the change of nature.</p>
<h3>Give play to the spirit of ants</h3>
<p>— Lü Fengzi</p>
<p>Maritime groups stand in great numbers. Some are for academic research, and some are for emotional connections. The purposes are similar and monotonous, not worth mentioning. I have recently participated in a meeting and feel that a new face has been opened, so I will introduce it to readers.</p>
<p>One day, a friend invited me to a tea party. When I arrived, there were many people, and there were many skirts and shoes. They were all people I had never met before. The friend introduced them one by one. There were newspaper reporters, doctors, painters, educators, and writers. There were all kinds of people. The modern ladies and young women were all the wives, lovers, or close friends of the members of the society. At first, I thought that my friend was not a rich man and did not have wide social interactions on weekdays. Now, he has gathered such a grand tea party, which made me doubtful. When the meeting started, I suddenly realized that it was not my friend who had invited me alone. I was just one of a few people. The one I was attending was not my friend's personal tea party, but a gathering of a group. The group only had a few people at the beginning. Because it was not easy to meet, they took turns gathering each month. Later, they introduced each other, and now there are fifty or sixty people. The results are remarkable. The society has regulations that are different from other groups. All members of the society must bring their spouses, regardless of whether they are married or not. This is one. The person on duty is not limited to one person, and the expenses are fixed and are not allowed to be exceeded to prevent waste. This is two. The meeting has no fixed address, and the place where it is held must not be the same. This is three. In addition, there must be entertainment at each meeting, and all participants must participate, so it is warm and joyful, unprecedented. The society's charter states that it aims to improve social interaction, seek life cultivation, and enable members to be nurtured by the group to promote the realization of a new society. Its measures are truly worthy of its name.</p>
<p>A friend said that the society's business is not limited to this, and it is also working hard in the cultural movement. The society has a credit circulation library that lends books to readers unconditionally through communication methods. Handling fees and security deposits are not charged. The reader's personality credit is fully guaranteed, so it is convenient for young people in various places and is also a library that is unprecedented in the country. Recently, it is planning to use mule carts and small wheels to carry books to the countryside to promote the popularization of culture, which is also the first undertaking in our country. The name of the society is "Ant". The actions of the members of the society are all like ants. The society has a slogan: "Give play to the spirit of ants". The members of the society can all practice it.</p>
<p>Although I am still participating in the meeting for the first time, the impression is very deep. I deeply feel that the society not only uses social interaction to adjust our boring lives, but also opens up new paths and strives for culture without falling into the clichés of others, which is very commendable. Therefore, I express it here.</p>
<h3>Hearing that Du Liyun has returned to Shanghai from Yanjing to perform American dramas. It just so happens that the blind poet's eyes can be seen, and the mad singing continues. The number of chapters ends at perfection.</h3>
<p>— Old Envoy of Sanjin</p>
<p>Don't ask Yunying about her unmarried life. She suspends her beauty to illuminate the world. Zhuhou, no matter how the clouds stop, I am the one who once broke my heart.</p>
<p>Ask Yan'e about the past twenty years. Dengchang Baoyu is even called the king. Embroidery clothes will eventually have Su San to replace. Still, the spring breeze leads the jade hall. (Yesterday, I met with Brother Wang Xiaolai and someone else to talk about the fact that I still have a large-scale San Tang trial system in the Youth Observation Hedong. Hongdong County is still solving many cases. Wang laughed and said, but it is a pity that there is no Su San. In the early years of the Republic of China, I was fond of the Shanghai prostitute Yan Niang, and then Wang Baoyu took care of her until she was the vice president of the Flower Country and was also famous for playing Yutangchun.)</p>
<p>Even if Jingzhou is lost, let's rejoice. The royal family and others are reunited. How can fierce battles increase loneliness and widowhood? How can Yang Zhi's nectar be universal? (Opening performance of Ganlu Temple and Yutangchun)</p>
<p>The youth of the arrow is everywhere. Every time I listen to Tanmu, my tears flow first. Please express the sadness of separation and reunion. The dream of hatred remains for fifty years. (The third day is the performance of Silang Visiting His Mother)</p>
<p>Homemade powder is naturally fragrant. Dare to compete with autumn orchids. The ten thousand gold bells flutter away. Prevent the drums from breaking your clothes. (I heard that Qing's name will stand with Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu. Recognizing a hero before he has emerged is not an old eye.</p>
<p>There are even bright eyes to identify A Jiao. Wanxian laughs at me for comforting my boredom. Cuitidi's cuckoos and cherry blossoms are miserable. I am too lazy to learn Ito's short night of suffering. (Three years ago, when I was almost blind with a little light, I asked Wan Cheng Xiangu to draw lots, and the lottery note was extremely wonderful. Some poets were looking for sentences to painstakingly push and show ridicule, and they also used words such as light shining on dust and true colors to show that the eyes must be healed. The person who died before me in East Asia was only Ito, whose Yanfu and Qi Xun were both famous.)</p>
<p>Looking back at Ena Hui Le Qing. Climbing the branches will not fail to send Qingxing. Lantai has many Lanyin sentences. Leave it to Hongchuang to carefully review. (My late father's name was Yutang Wutai. At that time, I was in the Ministry of Officials and was most satisfied with the Beijing opera poetry name. Fortunately, I was placed under the court, so I was listed in the Tongguang Poetry History twenty years ago.)</p>
<p>When has Du Niang ever been lonely? It is worth discussing the change of palace migration. Guanghan overwhelms Wang Lang's performance. Wait for Brother Xiaolai to be the Little Guanghan Palace in Luoyang, and get the most votes. I don't know if those who get the most votes can surpass Han Qiuying. Xiaolai asked me to listen to his new score of the Qi Jiguang drama, which is very strong. I am waiting for it.)</p>
<p>Wipe the gold and look at it after farewell. Even if the thatched cottage is pulled, I will forget the cold. Fireworks have their own news of wind. Meeting unintentionally reaches Peony.</p>
<p>For the sake of joy, the Fen River broke Feihe. Wu Song cut up too much hatred. The leader of the victory field is empty of all colors. They are all in the old net of my family. (Yu Changsheng in Beijing opera still has Yu Shuyan leading the Liyuan today. It is true that the official field is not as good as the opera field, but it is all just a play. The victory field will eventually belong to the Yu family.)</p>
<h3>Bold</h3>
<p>— Cast</p>
<p>Xu Jianqing, the director of the Continental Bank in Suzhou, died suddenly of an incurable disease at Boxi Hospital in Tianshizhuang. Since Mr. Xu took charge of the mainland, the business has been booming. His economic skills are truly admirable. Unexpectedly, he became ill due to overwork and was bedridden for several months. When the disease first started, his limbs were yellow. Before long, his whole body turned yellow. At that time, the family determined that it was jaundice and sent him to Boxi Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. The hospital needed to use an X-ray to determine what the disease was. After receiving the results, it was said that Mr. Xu's gallbladder was nine times larger than that of ordinary people. For a time, there were many rumors that this was an unprecedented奇事. The hospital has a history of decades, and it has a clear understanding of various medical common sense. It has also encountered many strange diseases. Mr. Xu's disease was said to have never been seen before. The strangeness can be imagined. Therefore, the joke about "Bold Xu Jianqing" spread all over the city inside and outside. (But thank you)</p>
<h3>Talking about Tangqi Loquat</h3>
<p>— Factory</p>
<p>Tangqi is located between Hangxian and Deqing. It is rich in loquats. Every time the loquats are on the market, Pingjin Ninghu and other major cities come to purchase them. It is because the richest area for loquat production is Tangqi. Someone has calculated that the total amount of loquats produced in Tangqi each year is worth about one million yuan. Tangqi loquats are divided into four types. The first is Baisha. Baisha is divided into soft branches and hard branches. The soft branches have softer stalks, the fruit is not very large, it is round and slightly long, the skin is light yellow with spots, the flesh is white with a slight green color, the core is small and less, and it is rich in pulp. When peeled and eaten, it drips between the fingers and tastes like honey and is fresh. Another feature is that the skin is very thin and can be rolled up when peeled. The loquats produced in Tangqi are the best. However, the output is very small. All of the annual output is reserved by wealthy families nearby for gifts. Therefore, even in the local market, it is rare to sell them. The Baisha loquats sold in various markets are all hard branches. The hard branches are second to the soft branches. The fruit is large and round, and there are many cores, so it is called Datou Baisha. It tastes fresh, sweet, and slightly sour. The color of the skin and flesh are the same as soft branches, and the juice is also rich. The output is relatively large, so it can be sold everywhere. The second is Hongzhong, also known as Da Hongpao. The skin and flesh are both red and yellow, the fruit is large and round, there are many cores and thin flesh, and it tastes sweet and light. People like it because of its large size and red color, which makes it look beautiful. In fact, it is only a form, and those who know it do not take it. The third is Yangdun (named after sand). The fruit is smaller than other types, it is long and round, one fruit has one core, the juice is rich and tastes fresh and sweet, and it is quite suitable to eat. However, the output is not much, because the producing area is only Yangdun (village). The fourth is Caozhong. The size of the fruit varies, the skin is greenish-yellow, and most of them taste sour. The output is particularly rich. Most of the ones sold on the market are of this type. The above-mentioned white soft branches and white sand, their flesh color is white, the pulp is abundant, and the taste is sweet, just like fresh lychees. However, the taste is sweet and fresh, which is not as good as fresh lychees. Therefore, soft-branched white sand is not only the best among loquats, but also a treasure among fruits. As for Hongzhong, it is just a name. It is not only far inferior to Baisha, but also inferior to Yangdun. It is only slightly better than Caozhong. The Yangdun species is very good. In addition to soft-branched white sand, this species should be promoted. It is only because the skin color is like Caozhong and the shape is small, so it is not noticed.</p>
<h3>The History of the Development of World Female Aviators (3)</h3>
<p>— Shushan</p>
<p>The talent of women as aviators can be seen from the "Women's Ascension," a book from Germany, which contains the life records of six air queens. The book was co-edited by the two German Gatti and Xiutokes. According to their preface, women have had a clear relationship with the aviation industry since 150 years ago.</p>
<p>When the Montgolfier brothers first conquered the sky with balloons, it attracted many women to watch them fly over Paris, and many brave women requested to take a ride. As a result, the requests of two or three female socialites were finally granted, and they were taken into the clouds. One of them reached a height of 2,700 meters on June 4, 1784, but the voyage lasted only 45 minutes. In 1785, it was said that a 14-year-old girl was flying in the aerial world on an airplane.</p>
<p>Later, in 1850, about 10% (i.e., 49) of the 500 Europeans with air travel experience were female. [Nationality distribution: 28 were British; 17 were French; 3 were German; and the remaining one was Italian.</p>
<p>But once away from this world of lust and annoyance, what kind of pleasure is there? This can be seen in what Mrs. Tibel, a pioneer of modern upper-class aviators, said at that time: "Going to the solemn, silent, and eternally peaceful aerial world, you can say that everything is satisfied when you ascend. In this sublime silence, how easy it is to forget the surface of the earth! When I believe that I have nothing to do with the people on the ground, I also feel that I am an eternal thing, which is really a pleasure. The so-called lower world has long ceased to exist for us. Because when the weather is extremely calm and clear, there are still thick clouds that separate us from the lower world."</p>
<h3>A Record of Striking the Bell in the Old Temple (43)</h3>
<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu</p>
<p>47 After negotiating, I went to the village to call a village assembly. One hundred and fifty or sixty people came when the bell rang. Brother Chun Sheng was elected as the chairman. There were two things that we didn't expect in this meeting. One was that Wang Er's sister-in-law proposed that women should also learn martial arts. She was already very strong and knew how to punch with both hands. Brother Wang Er was not her opponent. When she heard us talking about the sword team and the spear team, she also wanted to propose organizing a sickle team and a hoe team. Old Lady Song also said: "Women have always been protected by men, and this is the greatest shame for women. On weekdays, women are unable to protect themselves and suffer all kinds of anger from men. Once something happens, they are either captured or raped, and they cannot resist at all. Once their innocence is tainted, they have to hang themselves or jump into the pond. All of this is caused by women not taking martial arts into their own hands. Of course, when our women learn martial arts, we will definitely not compete with our own men. We must aim the guns outwards and not just beat our husbands in the room, which makes the neighbors unable to sleep. In short, our old temple has many Mulan women. It would be a pity if the women's army cannot be established." After listening to this great reasoning, we naturally agreed that women should join the military training. The second was that Old Lady Song proposed to organize a Red Cross and train in first aid methods such as stopping bleeding, disinfecting, bandaging, carrying people, and artificial respiration. This time, everyone discussed the issues with the purpose of talking less and doing more, and decided on the following six major cases:</p>
<p>1. All men in the village who are over 20 years old and under 40 years old should receive military training. Those who are sick should be delayed or exempted separately.</p>
<p>2. Women in the village who are willing to receive military training are free to join and will not be forced.</p>
<p>3. Military training in the village includes freehand boxing, swordsmanship, spearmanship, stone locks, iron bars, gun skills, platoon exercises, company exercises, camp exercises, and various new tactics.</p>
<p>4. The village should organize a rescue team and select qualified people to train and serve.</p>
<p>5. Huang Chunsheng was elected as the head of the group, Zhu Ping, Jiang Zhong, and Zhang Feihu were elected as the instructors, Zhonger was elected as the assistant instructor, Li Zhui, Brother Zhao Xiaoer, Sun Laowu, Qian Laosan, and Wang Er's sister-in-law were elected as the platoon leaders, and Old Lady Song was elected as the head of the rescue team.</p>
<p>6. Usually, train for one hour a day, suspended during the busy farming season, and increased to two hours during the idle month. Old Lady Song was pushed to invite her relative, the doctor Lu, to guide the rescue work. I was pushed to urge Zhang Feihu's master to teach national art. After the meeting, Mr. Zhu and Battalion Commander Jiang began to organize. I turned over Wansongling to invite Master Zhang. Will he come? This important mission cannot fail!</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial - Gold Prices Soar by Ten Taels</h3>
<p>Discovery of a Straight Line Advance: The Gold Exchange resumed trading yesterday, the fourth, and the market was very good, with prices rising rapidly. However, there were no excessively large transactions, just a straight-line advance. Throughout the day, there was a price difference of about five taels, ultimately leading to a surge of ten taels. The initial opening price already exceeded 760 taels, mainly due to the continuous decline in silver prices and the sharp fall in exchange rates. In the future, due to varying supply and demand, there were fluctuations of two or three taels. The tension in foreign exchange pushed the price to a new high of 766 taels at one point, before retreating slightly. The afternoon market was mediocre, with only slight fluctuations, eventually settling at 634 taels. However, the number of transactions among brokers was not significant, totaling only about 19,600 lots by the end of last month. A detailed account of the day's events follows:</p>
<p>Opening Soars by Ten Taels and One Mace: The market opened sharply in the early hours of August, soaring by ten taels and one mace, reaching 763 taels and five mace. Large silver bars had fallen by one-sixteenth during the three days of market closure, with silver prices falling by three-eighths. British and American exchange rates continued to decline, each falling by 2.75 to 2.8125 points, boosting market sentiment. Subsequently, there was a slight fluctuation of a tael or so, with varying activity among firms. Tai Chang Heng Chang Yong and others were buying, while Yuan Da Yong Heng Yu Xie Xing Yong were selling. Later, Zhi Feng Yong Heng Xing Yong Feng Bing Xing and others showed strong selling intentions, likely because the US dollar initially stabilized and then eased, with August contracts settling at 4.375 and September at 5.625. As a result, by 9:15, the price was 60 taels and four mace. Shortly after, Zhi Feng Yong Yuan Tai and others bought in, and HSBC bought USD for this month at 3.75 and Shanghai bought September at 6.25, leading to a rise of two taels, to 62.5 taels. When the British gold price was announced, it returned to 60 taels and eight mace to one tael and four mace, with British gold quoted at 0.125 and US dollars at 3.75, slightly increasing by a few mace, to one tael and eight mace. Subsequently, buying activity surged, with Yuan Mao Yong Da Xing Yong Da De Cheng Hui Xiang Da Cheng Wu Pin Tao Tou Heng Yu Fu Yu Tong Tai Chang Yuan Xing Yong and others buying actively. Furthermore, Mitsui absorbed 0.75 for November USD and traded half a yuan for September, with August settling at only 3.75, causing the gold price to jump by more than four taels, with only about one tael of fluctuation. Around 10:30, the price was 66 taels, but later, Chun Yuan Yong Yi Feng Yong Hong Kang Yong Qian Chang Xiang Yi Feng Heng Yu Shun Li and others rushed to sell. Mitsui had also sold 0.75 of November USD and 4.375 of August, making the market seem firm, falling sharply by four and a half taels to 61.5 taels at 11:10. However, there was a fluctuation of one tael in half an hour. Subsequently, Yu He Yi Feng Yong Hong Kang Yong bought in, and Zhejiang sold August USD to Zhong Fu at only 3.125, pulling the price up by more than two taels to 64.2 taels at 11:30. As the exchange rate eased again, the closing price was similar to the morning, with Heng Yu Wu Pin and others selling off, closing at 62 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Presents a Peaceful Tone: The afternoon market opened at 62.2 taels, then rose to 1.5 taels. Da De Cheng bought in, pushing it to 2.4 taels. Yi Feng Heng Yu sold off, pushing it back to 1.7 taels. Later, as the bank absorbed 0.75 of August British gold, 0.6875 of July, and 3.125 of July US dollars, Dalian gangs and Wu Pin and others bought in, but Heng Xing Bing Xing took the opportunity to sell, resulting in a fluctuation of seven or eight mace. After 3:00, Tong Chang Zhi Feng Yong Heng Yu and others bought in, causing the price to rise again, reaching 64.5 taels around 4:00. After that, it was flat. Shanghai sold 0.75 of September British gold, and trading on the floor was complex. Bing Xing sold and then bought again, and Wu Pin Tao Tou and Tong Chun also bought, but there were also many short positions being sold. Therefore, the closing price at 4:30 was 63.4 taels, a sharp increase of ten taels compared to the last trading day of last month before the holiday. After the closing, it traded again at around 3.5 taels. The largest price difference during the day was 5.6 taels, with a high of 66 taels and a low of 60 taels and four mace. The price of red bars increased by 9.5 taels. There were still over 5,600 lots of July contracts that had not been cleared, but this was more than 3,000 less than the previous week.</p>
<p>Quoted Price is Suppressed by One Tael: The quoted price for US dollars has been changed to 831 taels, a suppression of 70 taels to 656 taels. At noon, it was 69 taels, and in the afternoon, it was 689 taels, falling to 66 taels. The final price was 68 taels, which is still one tael more suppressed than last Thursday. The registered price for July and August was the same at 62 taels, with a makeup of 62 taels. In the afternoon, it was 63 taels.</p>
<p>Trading is Extremely Active Among Firms: Trading activities on the floor were vigorous. According to statistics, Yuan Mao Yong, Da Xing Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Yuan Tai, Yu He, Da De Cheng, Fu Tai Heng, Yi Yu, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Chang Yong and others were all buying. Shun Li, Wan Xing, Hong Kang Yong, Tong Chun, Xie Xing Yong, Yi Feng, Heng Xing, Zhi Feng Yong, Bing Xing, Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Da Yong were all selling. Yuan Kang Xiang, Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Chun Yuan Yong and others were buying and selling at different times. Furthermore, transactions in bills of exchange varied. In the afternoon market, Shun Li, Zhi Feng Yong, Tong Chang, Fu Yu, Wan Xing, Da Xing Yong, Tong Chun, Yuan Tai, Fu Tai Heng and others were all buying. Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Yuan Chun, Hui Yuan, Hui Xiang, Da Cheng were entering and exiting without any stable trend. There was Wu Pin Tao Tou, Xie Xing Yong, Heng Xing, Yi Feng, Yu He, Hong Kang Yong all selling. Bing Xing sold and then bought again, with a number that was not significant. Dalian gangs bought a total of four hundred and several tens of bars that day and sold over four hundred bars. The Guang gangs (Heng Xing Yi Feng) sold a total of one thousand three to four hundred bars, it is said.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market is Exceptionally Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the week and there were no telegrams for the silver market. However, from the 1st to the 3rd of this month, British silver was pulled down by 0.0625 and US silver by 0.375. This led to British and American exchange rates falling by more than two points each, which in turn caused the local foreign exchange rate to fall by half a grade. British gold fell by 0.125, to 1 shilling and 7 and 3/8 pence, and US dollars were even tighter, falling by 0.375, to 28 yuan and 8.875 cents. Hong Kong was still at 78 taels and 1.125 cents.

The gold market surged by ten taels, breaking through the 760-tael mark. The continuous decline in the silver market was expected. Chinese merchants, speculators, and gold shops were active, but there were only tens of thousands of pounds of British gold. The morning market was quiet, but the afternoon saw selling and then buying. There were about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan of US dollars, mostly covering short positions. Mitsui was the first to buy and then sell, and Sassoon &amp; Co., an Indian firm, sold off some near-term contracts. In the afternoon, Citibank also telegraphed the sale of contracts for this month.</p>

<h3>Competition for Foreign Cents Still Weak</h3>
<p>In previous days, with the banks closed, the money market's trading state was quite deserted. Also, there was little competition on the market price. The external appearance of the cent price appeared to be rising, but internally there was no possibility of a turning point. Ultimately, people's interest has increased a lot. Until yesterday, the banks reopened and competed, and as a result, the trend was still weakening. Although there was no huge decline like before, there was no sign of rising. It can be said that, because of the external demand, the silver root situation seems to be slightly stronger, but it is not expected that there will be any tension.</p>
<p>Cent Softens and then Strengthens, Two Markets are the Same: The market atmosphere of "foreign cents" is weak and it is difficult to turn better. Yesterday morning, with the opening of banks, the selling atmosphere was prosperous again.

The noon market slightly turned strong, rising two and a half mils, to 6 qian, 8 fen, 8 li, and 7 and a half mils. Looking at the overall situation, it still needs to continue to fall. "Silver dismantling" has been falling for several days, and it seems to be rising again in the past two days. Yesterday it was three cents higher, calculated as eight cents. The early and noon markets were still the same. Banks did not list prices. The initial water addition was eight or nine cents, then it was white, and finally there was still five or six cents. The market head衬 was moderately tight and loose, and the situation was quite peaceful.</p>
<p>Corner Foreign Coin Interaction, Copper Coin Lengthens: The morning market for Jiangnan small foreign coins was still 6 qian and 2 mils, and the noon market rose two mils and seven and a half mils, to 6 qian and 4 mils and seven and a half mils. The volume for morning market transactions was 4,500 corners, and the noon market was 3,500 corners. Guangdong small foreign coins seemed to be turning better, with the morning market at 5 qian, 8 fen, and 5 li, and the noon market changed a little 0.125, to 5 qian, 8 fen, 4 li, and 8 and 7.5 hūnlì. As a result, the interactions with the Jiang corners had a slight difference. The volume for morning market transactions was 170,000 corners, and the noon market was 85,000 corners. Copper coins lengthened by 1,000 wén, to 429,500 yuán. Transactions were over 41,200 strings. Also, the sum of silver deposits was 9,600 taels.</p>
<p>Silver Collection and Deliveries are Numerous, Foreign Exchange Transactions are Cold: Yesterday, with the opening of the banks, "silver deposits" and deliveries seemed more prosperous. Chinese merchants collected and delivered over 3.6 to 3.7 million in drafts and bills, and foreign merchants collected and delivered over 4 million in drafts and bills. The total amount collected and delivered by Chinese and foreign merchants was about 4 million. The various types of goods, exchange rates, tax miscellaneous deposits, and other collections and deliveries were over 1.05 million. Telegraphic transfer deposits were 1.2 million.

<h3>Silver Furnaces Smelt Old Coins</h3>
<p>Recently, because the price of "foreign cents" has fallen below the composition of the original coinage system, the silver furnaces believe that it is profitable, so they took the opportunity to rise up and purchase British silver dollars, Qing Dynasty silver coins, Guangdong, Jiangnan, Hubei and other old coins. They are all bought at the market price plus water, put into the furnace to smelt, extract silver, and recast silver ingots. Large amounts are put into the furnace every day. As a result, the market has almost collected all kinds of British silver dollars and old coins.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Slightly Higher Than Last Month</h3>
<p>The Market is Deserted, Only 2.4 Million in Transactions: The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange has resumed trading. Although the market has been closed for many days, the atmosphere on the market still shows no improvement. The volume of trading before and after the market is far less than before. The total amount of futures trading was 1.7 million yuan in the morning market, and only 700,000 yuan in the afternoon market, totaling 2.45 million yuan. Among them, the total sales tax each accounted for 4 to 500,000 yuan, and the rest were only around 200,000 yuan. The volume of spot transactions for the 6% Customs Duty 96 was only several tens of thousands of yuan. The total spot trading was 65,000 yuan, including 24,000 yuan for the 20% Customs Duty, 10,000 yuan for the 20% unified sales tax, and the rest were only several thousand yuan. As for the trends of various bonds, due to the dull situation and the indifferent attitude of large investors, the demand was lower than before, so the trend was extremely stable. The fluctuation before and after the market was very small. Only the small investors on the market bought in more, which was slightly higher than the end of last month. Only the spot price of troop reduction and the August issue of salt tax rose more significantly, and the others only rose by about six or seven cents. The following table shows that the spot prices of each bond are calculated excluding the principal and interest of the previous period.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market is Unpredictable</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market trends are extremely chaotic and unpredictable, because the recent transaction volume on the market is too strong and speculators' minds are unpredictable and changing rapidly, resulting in a chaotic market. The cotton yarn itself is still flat and weak, because the domestic social economy is bankrupt and the people are becoming increasingly poor, and the inland sales are quite deserted. Wuxi yarn is still sold in Shanghai, and Japanese merchants are competing to sell everywhere, and the selling price is especially low. Fortunately, the patriotic heart in South China is hot, and they are purchasing Chinese yarn in Shanghai, and the amount is huge, about 10,000 bales. According to some, most of them also contain speculative nature. As for when the marked yarn rises, manufacturers sell to cover, and in the afternoon, British factories opened 10,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn, and the market fell, it is said.</p>
<p>Manchurian Marked Yarn is Generally Flat and Weak: The Manchurian marked yarn opened in the morning market, and the opening buying atmosphere was strong due to the rise in American cotton. Each month rose by 1 or 2 qian, but it fell due to the sale of yarn by the yarn factory. As a result, each month still rose by 1 tael, 2 qian to 6.7 qian. In the afternoon, British factories opened a large number of cotton yarn, and the market fell again by 1 tael, 1 qian to 8.9 qian. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 53,400 bales. It was found that Yu Da sold 1,050 bales, Da Ji sold 850 bales, Tong Xing sold 1,650 bales, Chang Feng sold 2,000 bales, Da Fu sold 1,000 bales, and Yu Kang sold 1,000 bales. Rong Xing bought 2,200 bales, Rui Da bought 1,400 bales, and Chang Feng bought 3,600 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>Spot is Exclusively Strong with South District Gangs: Spot yarn is exclusively strong with gangs from the south port. It was found that a total of 9,000 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the day.

The market price rose by about 5 qian, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Atmosphere is Still High</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and was flat at noon, and the trend is still high, because the news of American cotton pest is still serious, and the gold market is strong, so there are still many new buyers, and the pulling force is especially strong, so the market atmosphere is harder than the yarn market. However, the actual needs of each factory are still quiet. The future of the cotton market still depends on the contraction of American cotton. It was found that most people on the market are optimistic, and the buyer's idea of doing more is extremely strong, but a certain giant merchant threw it out when it rose, it is said.</p>
<p>Zheng Marked Yarn Rises and Falls from Time to Time: The Zheng marked yarn opened in the morning market, and the American cotton rose again. In addition, the people's minds were strong on the previous day, and each month rose by 2, 3, and 4 qian. 23 markets changed suddenly and fell, but the bulls still bought in to increase their positions. In the afternoon, some bulls settled, falling 3 qian. The 23 markets, retail investors and large investors still went in and rose again. The result was flat. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 115,000 dan. It was found that Chang Ji sold 3,100 dan, Chang He sold 6,300 dan, and Chang Feng sold 3,400 dan. Ji Feng bought 2,100 dan, Sui Long bought 3,000 dan, Rui Da bought 2,400 dan, Shen Ji bought 2,600 dan, and Chang Feng bought 2,000 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Indian Cotton Market Trended Firm</h3>
<p>Last week's market was firm. Local sentiment was quite strong due to the lack of rain in the cotton-growing areas. Afterwards, there was unfavorable news about US cotton, which made it even stronger. Japan has no need, and there are very few spot purchases. Although the current exchange rate is unfavorable for Japanese merchants to purchase Indian cotton, it is expected that Japanese cloths will inevitably increase imports. Cotton shipped from Europe is all cleared by the end of the month. Local factories are purchasing spot goods, so cotton merchants are firm. Not many goods are arriving in Mumbai. The situation in India is strong. An appendix of last week's statistics is as follows: (Unit: 1,000 bales)</p>

<h3>The Grain and Rice Market is Loosening Daily</h3>
<p>Hu Nan (South Shanghai): Yesterday, about 20 boats arrived from each gang. Limited deposit on the river banks. The towns and country shops have been buying too short on the opening prices from the previous days. Moreover, the recent rise of prices has been too fast, and they seem unwilling to buy into the current market scene, making it unpredictable. However, it is only a habit of the申 land area. In addition, the weather is turning warmer, and the silver supply is lacking, so the appetite suddenly feels dull and weak. The volume of transactions was even less than yesterday. The sellers see the sales are slim and the goods are hard to set aside, the thick粳 market price suddenly fell 2 jiao. Although not much薄稻 goods, the orders were scattered.

<h3>Flour Market Firm and Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, both in the morning and afternoon after the opening, the markets in each month suddenly present a fierce rising wind, due to the quotations of foreign wheat, although no up and down, but due to the poor weather, and Japan's flood disaster, coupled with the loading and transportation expenses, it has been rumored to reduce the sales afterwards, it must be visible旺, the gold price also rose more than 10 taels, these kinds of situations, all for the rising cause, and the actual sales aspect, such as Tianjin gang successively completed spot powder more than 100000 bags, heard the naval ship estimated 110000, red blue car turret wheat root double horse etc. brand, totaled more than 40000 bags straight to Tianjin, still 1 tael 9 qian factory plate, so the popular enthusiasm industry inside and outside buying air, extremely hot热闹, but a part of manufacturers, then successively出档, so to the closing, then slightly back soft, watch the later step if North gang still moves, a time when can stand firm, also, as a result this month compared to the previous weekend rose 3/10 of the 8th, August rose 3/10 of the half, September and October rose 3/10 of the 2 li half, November and December rose 2/10 of the half, it is said.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea from Hangzhou Area Face Poor Summer Cocoon Harvest and Low Quality</h3>
<p>Low Prices and No Buyers: Many Producing Homemade Silk: Farmers in Linping and other areas of Hangzhou Prefecture have suffered significant losses on their spring cocoons this year, leading to tightened finances. There is little interest in raising summer silkworms. Only those with surplus leaves are raising improved breeds, but the weather remains unfavorable, resulting in an exceptionally poor cocoon harvest, only 10-20% of previous years. The cocoons are thin and of poor quality, and no one is inquiring about fresh cocoons. Even the local silk traders are uninterested.

<h3>Piece Goods Traders Eagerly Buying Camel Wool</h3>

Yesterday, Rong Tai and De Ji offered wide and narrow camel wool wholesale at 2.575 yuan per yard. Wei Lun, Tian Xiang, Wei Yi, Xian Da, Sheng Da, Hong Fa, Mao Ye, Da Chang, Da Zhong Guo, Da Da, Hua Dong, Tong Yi, Da Nan, and other domestic brands sold at 2.15 yuan, and mixed colors at 1.80 yuan. The "Tiger" and "Crane" brands were particularly popular for their durable quality.</p>
<h3>Galvanized Iron Sheet Sales Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Since the Boxer Indemnity Committee sold off its stock of galvanized iron sheet, the market price has been severely affected. However, actual sales remain sluggish, and demand from customers is weak, resulting in a very depressed market. In recent days, businesses are concerned about the substantial losses and are seeking to support prices. This has led to discussions about raising prices at the trade association. As a result, market sentiment has improved, and prices have risen by a few cents. Currently, 7-foot sheets sell for 88.5 cents each, 6-foot sheets for 79 cents each, 28-gauge sheets are estimated at 11.25 taels per dozen, 26-gauge at 10.05 taels, and 24-gauge at 9.75 taels. It is reported that 300-400 dozen sheets were sold yesterday, mainly bought by customers from the north.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Prices Drop More Than Two Taels</h3>
<p>35-pound tinplate is essential for cigarette factories and biscuit companies. Due to previous shortages and strong demand, prices rose by two to three taels. The highest price was estimated at 43.5 taels. In recent days, supplies have increased significantly, but actual sales have slowed. As a result, prices fell by one tael yesterday, with each box selling for 41 taels, but there are few buyers.</p>

<h3>Japanese Commander Sokonji Arrives in Shanghai on the Izumo Yesterday</h3>
<p>Third Fleet Stationed in Shanghai</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Strength in the Yangtze Greatly Increased</p>
<p>After the withdrawal of the Japanese army from Shanghai, the Japanese navy, in order to strengthen its forces in the Yangtze River, has increased the number of marines stationed in Shanghai and Hankou, adding motorized machine gun units and howitzer units. There are twenty Japanese warships from Shanghai to Hankou, with over four thousand marines and sailors. Now, the commander of the Third Fleet has been transferred to Shanghai. Lieutenant General Sokonji arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The arrival of the flagship of the Third Fleet is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Commander Arrives in Shanghai: After Japanese Navy Vice Admiral Nomura was transferred to the Naval Education Bureau, Lieutenant General Sokonji succeeded him as Commander of the Third Fleet and was ordered to transfer to Shanghai. Sokonji took the flagship Izumo from Sasebo Naval Base on the 2nd of this month and arrived in Shanghai. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the ship arrived at Wusong, flying the flag of a lieutenant general outside the port and sailing into the Huangpu River. Three Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai raised flags to welcome the arrival. At 3:00 PM, the ship arrived in front of the Waibaidu Bridge, and Lieutenant General Sokonji disembarked.</p>
<p>Japanese Officials Greet Arrival: Commander Sugisaka, Major General of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Force, the Commander of the First Overseas Dispatch Army, and Murai, the Japanese Consul in Shanghai, prepared a small steamship at the new customs wharf and sailed out to greet them. They accompanied Lieutenant General Sokonji ashore to rest temporarily at the headquarters of the First Overseas Dispatch Army in Hongkou.</p>
<p>Warship Anchored: After the Izumo warship entered the Huangpu River, Lieutenant General Sokonji designated the ship to anchor in front of the Japanese Consulate, where Nomura had previously been stationed. However, as the Nissin Company's Yangtze River ship needed to dock there, the Izumo was temporarily ordered to anchor on a buoy in front of the Nissin Wharf. Japanese residents in Shanghai have prepared a banquet at the Japanese Club in Hongkou at 7:00 PM on the 6th, represented by Miri and Ota, to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun to Visit Corningham Today</h3>
<p>Seeking Opinions on Japanese Troops in D Area: The Japanese troops temporarily stationed in the D area, including the Great China University, Toyota, Wah Feng, and other yarn factories, and the Tongwen Academy, have not withdrawn after the expiration date. Yu Hongjun, a Chinese member of the Joint Committee, has repeatedly made stern representations to Okazaki, the Japanese member. Except for a small number of Japanese troops in the Tongwen Academy, who have withdrawn, the Japanese have repeatedly prevaricated and vacillated on the issue of the D area and the yarn factories. Yu made a written report to Corningham, the chairman of the Joint Committee, regarding the Japanese side's lack of sincerity. Okazaki then told Yu the same day that the Japanese troops in the area were preparing to withdraw, and the next day, he telephoned Yu to report that the Japanese troops were preparing to withdraw, but he never gave a definite date. Yu waited until yesterday, but the Japanese side still had no definite news, believing that the Japanese side had no sincerity in withdrawing at all. He decided to visit Corningham, the chairman of the Joint Committee, today to report on the negotiations between China and Japan, the Japanese troops' repeated prevarications, and the situation of not withdrawing, and to seek the opinions of the Joint Committee to urge further negotiations with the Japanese side. According to the Japanese Daily News reporter, the Japanese side's prevarication and refusal to withdraw Japanese troops temporarily stationed in the D area and various yarn factories is intended to wait for the outcome of our side's negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council on the recovery of the roads beyond the settlement boundaries. As the D area includes the area of the roads beyond the settlement boundaries, now that our side's negotiations with the Municipal Council on the recovery of the roads beyond the settlement boundaries are about to materialize, the Japanese have decided that if the roads beyond the settlement boundaries are successfully recovered by our side, they will make a blatant statement that not only will the Japanese troops stationed in the D area remain stationed, but they will also prepare to increase the number of marines.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Recovery of Roads Beyond the Settlement Boundaries is Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>The latest news on the recovery of roads beyond the Shanghai Public Settlement boundaries is as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Council Special Meeting Undecided: According to news from the Secretariat of the Municipal Council, the special board meeting originally scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the issue of roads beyond the settlement boundaries has not been confirmed due to the lack of agreement on the remaining unresolved points in the draft agreement. It is uncertain whether tomorrow's regular meeting will be changed to a special meeting. It is likely to be announced on short notice. At the same time, it has not been decided whether the case will be raised for discussion that day.</p>
<p>Westerners Speculate on the Japanese Attitude: Westerners believe that the biggest reason for the Japanese opposition to the solution of the roads beyond the settlement boundaries issue is the Zhabei war caused by the January 28th Incident. In the Shanghai War, the Japanese army was nameless, and the result was nothing. In the past, troops were stationed in the North Sichuan Road area beyond the settlement boundaries. If the roads beyond the settlement boundaries are resolved, the Japanese will not be allowed to station troops on the roads outside the boundaries allowed by the Armistice Agreement. From the perspective of face, the Japanese expedition to Shanghai has not only gained nothing, but also the troops stationed on the roads beyond the settlement boundaries will not be allowed. In order to deal with the domestic situation, they have to resolutely oppose it. Our government should be able to see through its concealment and resolutely reject it.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Issued a Declaration of Opposition Yesterday: According to the Times News Agency, regarding the issue of recovering roads beyond the settlement boundaries, the Japanese residents in Shanghai are increasingly opposed because the Municipal Council is likely to pass the draft agreement. The two major Japanese organizations in Shanghai (the Residents' Association and the Commercial Federations of various roads) convened an emergency joint meeting at the Japanese Club on Wenjian Shi Road the day before yesterday. Murai, the Japanese Consul, and Terai and Okamoto, the Japanese Directors of the Municipal Council, were invited to attend and participate in the meeting. As a result, in addition to urging Okamoto and Terai to strongly express their opposition when attending the special meeting of the Municipal Council, they also issued a solemn declaration of opposition in the name of the residents' organization and the commercial federations of various roads. The full text is very long, with many absurd words. They expressed deep dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council's abandonment of the right to build roads beyond the settlement boundaries. The translation is as follows: The Chinese government's recovery of the Shanghai Municipal Council's roads beyond the settlement boundaries has entered the implementation phase from the preparatory period. The draft agreement has been largely successful after several meetings between Yu Hongjun, the person in charge on the Chinese side, and Fessenden, the Director-General of the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council will convene a special meeting within a few days to discuss it. It seems that the partial resolution of the case is undoubtedly possible, but all our residents in Shanghai will swear to oppose it. The Municipal Council's abandonment of the right to build roads beyond the settlement boundaries is of great importance to our merchants. The Chinese side has no ability to protect the lives and property of our residents living within the roads beyond the settlement boundaries. During the Chinese residents' riot in 1927, the Municipal Council immediately abandoned its security rights north of Route Laobaizi and ordered our marines to take over, but the losses of our residents' property in that area were incalculable. Although the draft agreement between China and the Municipal Council on the recovery of roads beyond the settlement boundaries contains a clause that "the issue of public order within the roads beyond the settlement boundaries will still be maintained by the Municipal Council's special police," it still cannot provide our residents with complete protection to live and work in peace. Therefore, our residents firmly believe that this roads beyond the settlement boundaries must not be allowed to be recovered by the Chinese side. This will not only deprive our residents of the protection of their lives and property, but also have a great impact on the people of all friendly countries in Shanghai. Since the cessation of hostilities in the Shanghai War, the anti-Japanese actions of the Chinese people in Shanghai have not stopped. Even Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, has no power to stop his people from taking anti-Japanese actions and boycotting Japanese goods. This alone is enough to deeply believe that Chinese officials have no willpower to restrain the people. If the roads beyond the settlement boundaries are recovered by China, to what extent will the various dangers faced by our Shanghai merchants be? Therefore, we solemnly declare that all our Japanese residents in Shanghai will do our utmost to oppose the abandonment of roads beyond the settlement boundaries and their recovery by China. This declaration is made for the attention of people of all friendly countries. The Japanese Residents' Association and the Commercial Federations of various roads.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Urgent Repair of Wusong Seawall</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday petitioned the Municipal Government to urgently repair the Wusong seawall. The document stated that Wusong suffered unprecedented damage during this war since the port was opened. The merchants and residents there rely on it for their livelihood. After the situation stabilized, they needed to return to their hometowns and build simple houses along the Outer Bund to resume business. However, the seawall of the wharf has been bombed repeatedly by enemy shells, the soil has been loosened, and the situation is dangerous. The lives and property of hundreds of families are at stake, and urgent repairs are necessary. However, after the war, the local financial resources have been exhausted, and the required repair costs cannot be achieved without relying on public funds. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce has submitted this petition, requesting the Municipal Government to examine and approve it, and to instruct the relevant authorities to send personnel to estimate and repair the seawall immediately, in order to provide protection and reassure the people. This is for the public benefit.</p>
<h3>Central Government Intends to Issue Public Bonds Again</h3>
<p>Under the Name of Suppressing Bandits: Amounting to Four Million Grand Public Shares: According to reliable sources, Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei, Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, and Deputy Commander of the Bandit Suppression Li Jishen came to Shanghai recently to discuss and resolve the financial problems of the central government's bandit suppression military expenditures with Finance Minister Song. The negotiations were very satisfactory. It is said that Finance Minister Song believes that the bandit suppression military expenditures require at least 2.4 million yuan per month. At a time when the central government's finances are exhausted, it is difficult to implement both revenue enhancement and expenditure reduction. There is no other way to raise such a large sum of money in the short term except by issuing new public bonds. Therefore, it is proposed to issue a kind of bandit suppression public bond to provide relief. Finance Minister Song has also drafted the draft regulations and various detailed rules for the issuance of bandit suppression public bonds, which have been reviewed by Premier Wang and others. After detailed research, it was believed that it was feasible to implement it. Therefore, the day before yesterday afternoon, Premier Wang and others summoned the leaders of the banking and public opinion circles in Shanghai to exchange opinions. The result was also very satisfactory. Now, Premier Wang and others have returned to Nanjing, preparing to submit the principle of issuing bandit suppression public bonds to the Central Political Council for discussion and approval for implementation. The total amount of public bonds is 4 million yuan, guaranteed by the customs revenue of the Republic of China in 1933, and it is decided that the Shanghai banking community will separately underwrite the bonds.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Citizens' Association Petition Municipal Government Yesterday to Reduce and Exempt Rent</h3>
<p>Municipal Government to Announce Measures Soon: The Municipal Citizens' Association, based on the request of the Joint Office of the Hongkou District, believes that the city has suffered heavy losses since the Shanghai Incident. The authorities are concerned about the people's suffering and should urgently announce measures to reduce and exempt rent in order to relieve the situation and plan for recovery. The Executive Committee has approved the petition to the Municipal Government. The Association appointed representatives Zhang Xianfang and Wang Zhaocheng yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, together with representatives Wang Rongtang, Zhou Fuzhang, and Zheng Dongshan from the Joint Office of the Hongkou District Sub-Associations and the Road Sub-Associations.</p>
<p>They submitted a petition, and the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Petition: We respectfully submit that the issue of reducing and exempting rent in the city has been delayed until now and has not been resolved. This is not good for the local area in the long run. Fortunately, we have heard that you have been ordered to handle it in order to solve everything. The citizens are all looking forward to this. Since the January 28th Incident, the houses in the war zone have been destroyed by artillery fire, and the people have fled. It is undoubtedly a fact that the rent during the war should be waived. In the Nanshi Special Zone, people either fled to other places for refuge, or shops were closed due to resistance, and houses and shops were unable to be used for profit. In addition, the commercial sector is sluggish, and life is bleak. The indirect losses are indeed not worth mentioning. The perilous situation in the Hongkou area was no less than that in Zhabei and Wusong. The Shanghai Municipal Council has also reduced and exempted general donations, and there is a basis for reducing and exempting rent. Therefore, the demand for reducing and exempting rent is not an excessive act. The Association is more familiar with the situation in the Special Zone, and specially appointed representatives to come forward to state everything. We hope that you will grant us an audience. We are grateful to the public. To Wu, Mayor of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Responds: The representatives set off at 11:00 AM and arrived at the Municipal Government at Fenglin Bridge. However, Mayor Wu was out on official business and had not returned. They waited in the reception room. Around 12:00 PM, the Director of Audit came out and said that the Mayor had not yet returned. If there was anything to state, he could pass it on. The representatives then stated the purpose of their petition, demanding that the Municipal Government promptly promulgate measures to reduce and exempt rent in order to avoid civil unrest, which was urgent. Director Wang replied that the Municipal Government was paying close attention to the rent reduction issue. The Mayor had convened several meetings with real estate owners, tenants, and the court. The result was satisfactory. The measures for reducing and exempting rent would be announced in the next few days, or within this week. He hoped they would wait patiently. The representatives also recounted that some vicious landlords disregarded the people's hardship after the disaster and the bleak business conditions, and even increased or demanded rent, or even took the opportunity to renovate, and asked the Municipal Government to take measures to stop it and stabilize the area. Director Wang said that if this happened, they could ask the Rent Dispute Committee to handle it. The representatives believed that the promulgation of the rent reduction and exemption measures was scheduled, and they were satisfied. Then they took their leave.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Labor Strike Becomes Serious Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhabei Silk Factory Strikes Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Trade Association's Attitude Resolute</p>
<p>A labor dispute occurred in three silk factories, including Yichang, in the Hongkou District, causing a strike that affected all silk factories in the district. Silk factories in the Zhabei District automatically stopped work. Representatives were sent by both the trade association and the labor union to negotiate for days. The situation gradually eased the day before yesterday, and all silk factories in the Zhabei District resumed work. The female workers in the silk factories in the Hongkou District also went to the factories to inquire about the opening date. But yesterday the situation became serious again, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Silk Factories in Zhabei Destroyed Factory Gates: The 35 silk factories in Zhabei District that resumed work yesterday morning sounded the call as usual, and the female workers went to work. By 6:30 AM, all the workshops were full, and nothing happened during lunch break. Suddenly, after 2:00 PM, more than 20 men and women who looked like outsiders came to the Dingji Silk Factory on Hengfeng Road and forced the female workers to stop work. At that time, the factory gate was closed, so the group used wooden sticks and boulders to destroy the factory gate. The two main gates were destroyed. The mob rushed into the workshop, and the female workers stopped work and left through the back door. Then they went to the Yuanhe Silk Factory, and the main gate was also destroyed. The silk factories, hearing the news, fearing losses, automatically stopped work. However, the female workers at the Qia Tai and other silk factories on Meiyuan South Road asked the factory director and police to add protection. Although the rioters also came to the front of the factory and created disturbances, they were eventually driven away by the police. The female workers worked until 6:00 PM and then returned home.</p>
<p>Trade Association Convenes an Extraordinary General Meeting: The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association convened an extraordinary general meeting of all members at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than 50 people, including Zhu Jing'an, Zhang Peishen, Huang Jinfan, Sun Rongchang, and Qian Jingzhi, attended. Zhu Jing'an was elected as chairman (Chairman Shen Chen was away in Hangzhou on official business). At the meeting, Chairman Zhu first reported on the negotiations with the labor union representatives in the past two days and the points raised by the labor side, and asked the members to discuss solutions in order to prepare a response. After discussions among the representatives present, it was generally believed that the current labor strike was not the true intention of the workers. Judging from the fact that after the silk factories in Zhabei resumed work, the workshops were full of female workers, and the female workers in the Hongkou District had been going to the silk factories for days to inquire about the opening date, it was evident that the workers were willing to work as usual to maintain their livelihoods. They were very clear about the difficulties of the factories and had no demands. This was purely troublemaking by a third party. However, at a time when the foreign silk market has plummeted and silk operators are heavily indebted, the hardships of this situation are not only known to people at home and abroad, but the whole world is deeply sympathetic to the very difficult situation of the silk industry. In short, all businesses would not want to sacrifice everything if there was any profit to be made. Now that the silk factory industry is in a very serious period, the capital has been lost without a trace, and the silk cocoons have been mortgaged to the financial sector. Not only is there no way to redeem the principal, but the interest and rent have not been paid for months. The silk factory industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. Of the 32 silk factories that are currently operating, 80-90% are wrapping silk for customers. The wrapping price is abnormally low because the foreign silk price is very low and the silk cost is high. If the labor price is increased, the losses will be greater. The wrapping price obtained by the factory cannot be sustained even with a wage of 42 cents per worker. If the wage is to be increased again, how can the factory recover its losses? All the funds have been lost early, and the financial sector is unwilling to lend. Then the factory is unable to pay this excess expenditure, even if it agrees. However, the rioters deliberately made it difficult for our industry, and were determined to deprive both labor and capital of a place to eat. Then we have no choice but to sacrifice everything and stop work together, waiting for the disposal of the party and government organs. At this point, Chairman Zhu repeatedly advised the representatives to attach importance to the workers' livelihoods. After discussing the eight conditions proposed by the labor union, the eight conditions were put to a vote one by one. (1) One or two silk factories in the Hongkou District are paying wages in small silver dollars. It is requested that all factories calculate wages in silver dollars. The public decided to do so. (2) Because the factories only seek to produce a large quantity and do not care about the quality of the work, it is requested that this be improved. The public believes that this matter is related to raw material problems and has nothing to do with the workers. It was rejected. (3) The case of placing unemployed workers (the labor union automatically withdrew it and it was not discussed). (4) The case of worker treatment was not discussed because contracts were signed. (5) The case of union fees: The public decided that if there were no labor strikes and the silk factories could work safely, then the union fee would be paid at one corner per machine. (6) Wages, (7) Wage increase. The two cases were discussed together. The public decided that they could not be increased at all. (8) Time case: The public decided to handle it according to the previously agreed working hours. After the vote, the representatives of the same industry were very firm in their attitude that wages could not be increased. They were willing to stop work. They signed their names on the minutes of the meeting in order to show unity. If they do not receive effective protection from the official authorities, they will not start work. From today, all silk factories in Zhabei will stop work. Zhu Jing'an, Zhang Peichuo, Huang Jinfan, and Sun Rongchang were publicly elected as representatives. They will bring a petition to the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Public Safety, and the four or five districts at 10:00 AM today, separately, requesting them to add protection and to strictly detain the troublemakers in the industry in order to stabilize business. After the meeting, it was already 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Investigates the Labor Strike in the Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
<p>Trade Association to Hold General Meeting Today</p>
<p>Labor Union Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>After the labor strike occurred in the city's national pharmaceutical industry, the situation remains serious. The City Party Department is trying to mediate. The Municipal Government ordered the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Public Safety to investigate and mediate. The workers petitioned the Municipal Government, and the Trade Association will hold a general meeting today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Government Investigates: After the Municipal Government received reports from both the labor and management sides of the national pharmaceutical industry, in order to solve the problem quickly in case a strike occurs, which would affect local security and the people's suffering, it ordered the Bureau of Public Safety and the Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate the truth and mediate. It is said that after receiving the order, the two bureaus will jointly plan with the City Party Department today in order to carry out mediation.</p>
<p>Labor Union Petitions: The Pharmaceutical Workers' Union appointed Zhao Zhenhui, Chen Yantao, Feng Xingkang, Chen Baozhi, and Yuan Pinzhang yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to petition the Municipal Government, requesting (1) to strictly order the management not to arbitrarily destroy labor-management conditions, (2) to adopt the wage increase standards proposed by the labor union. The Chief of the Third Section received them, promising to accept them completely, and requested that the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Public Safety be ordered to investigate and mediate quickly in order to avoid expanding the labor strike (the petition is omitted).</p>
<p>Hangzhou Assistance: The Pharmaceutical Association held small group meetings in the first, third, and fifth districts yesterday. Regarding the management's destruction of labor-management conditions, it was decided to deal with it collectively. Only until the goal is achieved. Regarding the strike by the workers of Feng Cunrentang, it was decided to provide assistance with strength. The Hangzhou Pharmaceutical Workers' Union appointed representatives Ye Zhifang and Wang Yongjian to Shanghai yesterday to comfort the pharmaceutical workers, expressing that they were determined to lead all pharmaceutical workers in Hangzhou to provide assistance with strength.</p>
<h3>Great Yangtze River Flood Prevention</h3>
<p>Building a City-Encircling Fortress Will Keep Hankou Safe</p>
<p>The Grand Embankment Project is Divided into Nine Sections</p>
<p>The Great Yangtze River flood has submerged areas such as Changsha and Yiyang, severing all transportation in Hunan. The shipping industry in Shanghai has also begun flood prevention measures. Meanwhile, Hankou is constructing a city-encircling fortress, and the Flood Relief Works Bureau is raising the long embankment. The latest flood prevention measures obtained by reporters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Builds a Fortress: After the construction of the long flood prevention embankment on the Yangtze River, the water level has been rising due to the backflow from the Xiang River, exceeding forty feet. The Wuhan Municipal Government authorities are deeply concerned that the river will rise to the same level as last year's fifty-two feet in August. Therefore, the Municipal Government and the Water Conservancy Engineering Office have agreed to start building a city-encircling flood prevention fortress in Hankou as a second line of defense outside the river embankment. The fortress is four feet high and one foot two or three inches wide. The body of the fortress is built with cement and a mixture of earth, and greater emphasis is placed on the riverside along the docks. A large number of workers have been hired and are rushing to build it in sections. Therefore, Wuhan is determined to avoid floods this year.</p>
<p>Wharves Urge Cargo Pickup: Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company,</p>
<p>Ning Shao, San Bei, and Five Other Companies: In view of the rapid rise of the Yangtze River water level, and fearing that the situation may be similar to the land submersion of last year, the five companies held a special meeting to discuss ways to avoid the danger of cargo accumulating in the wharves of various Yangtze River ports. They decided to issue a public notice, urging customers to pick up their goods as soon as possible, stating that because the Yangtze River is rising and the situation is unpredictable, no matter what protective measures the company takes, if there is any danger, the cargo owners are responsible. Even if special expenses are incurred, they will still be paid when picking up the goods.</p>
<p>Transportation Disrupted: The provinces of Hunan, Changsha, Changde, Yiyang, and other places are submerged by the flood. The reasons are very complex, but it is known that boats can travel in the city of Changsha with electricity from the Xiang River. Water and land transportation are blocked by the flood. All waterways in Hunan Province have been completely impassable since the 27th. Even the large flood prevention projects such as dike repairs by the Construction Bureau have been completely suspended due to special circumstances. Shipping in Hunan Province has been blocked.</p>
<p>Embankment Heightened: The Flood Relief Committee's Construction Bureau is building the Yangtze River's Great Embankment to prevent flooding. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of last month. The fact that the lower reaches of Hankou have not been flooded and the fact that Jiangxi and Anhui have not been affected are all due to the protection of this embankment. After the rapid increase in the Yangtze River water level on June 26, the Construction Bureau, in order to consolidate the embankment itself and prevent the continued rise of the water level, ordered each branch to raise the 9,700-mile embankment from Jingjiang Qianjiang in the upper reaches to Zhenjiang Guazhou in the lower reaches by one meter. This will extend the project, provide more relief wheat, and prevent the river from overflowing when it reaches its highest level. The embankment is currently being rushed.</p>
<p>General Project Report: The Yangtze River flood prevention project will soon be fully completed (except for the Xiang River). The large-scale embankment construction project undertaken by the Construction Bureau will also come to an end. Chief Engineer Xi Dejiong, engineer expert Zhou Houkun, and others have made great contributions. The starting point of the embankment is in Xiantao Town, Hanjiang, reaching Qianjiang Jingjiang and reaching Cihu River in Jiangsu, totaling 2,184 kilometers in length. It is divided into nine areas, constructed in sections, using a total of 135,230 tons of relief wheat. The first area is Jiangsu, from Zhenjiang Nanci Lake to Guazhou's Daojiang Town, totaling 230 kilometers, supervised by Song Daan. The second area is Anhui, south from Caishiji to X溝, north from Wujiang to Datong, totaling 275 kilometers, supervised by Lin Zicun. The third is northern Anhui, from X溝 to Fangjia Zhou, north from Datong to Hukou, totaling 364 kilometers, supervised by Xi Yiqun. The fourth area is Jiangxi, from Yangliuwu to Ertoukou, totaling 210 kilometers, supervised by Yan Huimin. The fifth to ninth are all within Hubei Province, from Ertoukou, Junshan to X堤, Cheng Lu Ji, Xiantao Town, directly reaching Jingjiang, totaling 1,565 kilometers, supervised by He Baochu and others. During construction, a general grain station was set up in Pukou, and six branch grain platforms were set up in Wu, Wan, Xun, Han, Shashi, and Chenglingji for disaster relief organization.</p>

<p>Twenty-five people are in one row, twenty rows are in one company, ten companies are in one section, totaling five thousand people. Each section has one engineer and one supervisor. In total, there are more than two hundred engineers and more than two thousand supervisors. The Yangtze River project cost approximately 40 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's American Independence Day Celebration</h3>
<p>American Community Holds Grand Celebration: Yesterday was the 156th anniversary of the United States Declaration of Independence, the most solemn national holiday for Americans. All American communities around the world held celebrations. The American community in this port had already elected a committee to determine the order of celebration. At 8:00 AM yesterday, the U.S. Marine Corps gathered at the racecourse, fired salutes, played the national anthem, and held a flag-raising ceremony, followed by a military parade, which was inspected by U.S. Consul General Cunningham.

At noon, U.S. Consul General Cunningham received congratulations at the consulate. Hundreds of Chinese and foreign guests gathered to wish the United States prosperity and President Hoover good health. In the afternoon, a grand celebratory banquet was held at the American Club on Fuzhou Road. Prominent American community members and distinguished Chinese and foreign guests gathered. After the banquet, at 3:30 PM, the U.S. Navy Rochester baseball team and the Shanghai amateur team held a baseball game at the racecourse, which is also one of the routine programs for American Independence Day. As for the celebrations held by American community members, individuals, and groups, they are too numerous to mention.</p>
<h3>Wu Kaisheng Appointed Member of the National Government's Foreign Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>Wu Kaisheng, our country's envoy to Switzerland and Director of the Chinese Plenipotentiary Office to the League of Nations, was previously summoned back to China by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report on the truth of the League of Nations' position on China. The central government, considering that Mr. Wu has attended various League of Nations conferences and is very familiar with the League of Nations situation, appointed Mr. Wu as a member of the National Government's Foreign Affairs Committee through the Central Political Council last week. It is said that Mr. Wu plans to go to Beijing in the next few days to present his views on foreign affairs to the authorities.</p>
<h3>Former Guangdong Air Force Captain Liu Zhiyan Denies Participating in the Guangdong War</h3>
<p>But the Idea of Developing China's Aviation Has Never Left His Mind: The Southern Sky is Shrouded in Clouds and Smoke from the War. The newspapers have been reporting these days, causing a great stir. The Kwow Min News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Liu Zhiyan, the former captain of the 5th squadron of the Guangdong Air Force, at his residence yesterday. It was found that Mr. Liu had previously acted as the director of the Guangdong Aviation Office on behalf of Mr. Zhang Huichang and had successively served as the education director of the Guangzhou Aviation School. This time, due to the changes in the political situation in eastern Guangdong, he resigned and came to Shanghai. Here is a record of his conversation: (Question) Is it true that the Guangzhou Air Force attacked naval ships, as reported in the newspapers? (Answer) I have previously telegraphed that I will not participate in the civil war. After the Guangdong situation changed, I came to Shanghai and am very unfamiliar with the news of Guangdong. As for the attack on naval ships by the Air Force, there are many Air Force colleagues who are deeply aware of righteousness, but perhaps there are a few who are blinded by profit and are being used by others, which is probably unavoidable. (Question) Have you read the report that Ding Ji Xu and you encountered each other in the air during the Air Force's attack on Hainan? (Answer) Smiling, he said, "I have seen it, but I have been in Shanghai for more than a month, and I have no way to be in two places at once. How could I be fighting with Ding Jun in the skies of southern Guangdong? This may be propaganda for some purpose, but it is not worth a smile from the reporter." (Question) What is your mission in Shanghai this time? (Answer) I have been serving in the aviation industry for six or seven years and have never rested. This time, I am coming to Shanghai to relax and travel. There is really no other mission, but the idea of developing China's aviation has never left my mind." After saying goodbye,</p>
<h3>Water Supply Problems in Epidemic Areas</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Replies to Wu Liande: Wu Liande, Director of the Harbor Quarantine Office, received a reply from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, your previous letter stated that in order to promote the effectiveness of epidemic prevention, please forward to the water company and reduce the water price so that poor people can generally enjoy clean drinking water, etc. Considering that this matter concerns social welfare, letters were sent to the Chinese and foreign water companies, and they agreed to do as requested and handle the follow-up matters. Now, we have received a letter from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Co., Ltd., stating that the price of our company's water is 45 cents per thousand gallons, which is equivalent to only 15 cash coins per bucket for ordinary buckets. In areas with a large number of poor people, retail drinking water faucets are set up, selling at 30 cents per thousand gallons, which is only 10 cash coins per bucket. Not only is it cheaper than the price of various water companies in this port, but there is no cheaper drinking water elsewhere. Therefore, the reason why poor people do not know about hygiene and drink raw water is due to their lack of knowledge and bad habits, rather than the inability to obtain cheap tap water. We also received a reply from the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company, stating that this matter is currently being studied by our company's board of directors, and we will inform you of the results later, etc. Based on this, we are sending a corresponding letter to inform you. Please note that the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has recently installed retail water faucets in Tanziwan in Zhabei and Yongxing Road at the end of Datong Road, etc., where there are many poor people, entrusting small shops along the road to manage them, selling them for about one copper coin per bucket. However, many poor people still do not know about the cheap price and buy it," it said.</p>
<h3>Current Status of Epidemic Prevention in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>At the Public Concession Board of Directors meeting last week, the Director of the Health Department reported that, as of that day, there were approximately 1,000 reported cases of cholera, with a maximum of 70 cases in one day. This number is lower than the same period during the epidemic in 1929, but the epidemic occurred later that year, so the spread was faster. It is still difficult to predict whether it will intensify in the coming months this year. However, based on the current reports, the epidemic situation in this port seems to be more moderate than in other cities in China, and the mortality rate is also very low. The vaccination work is currently being carried out on a large scale. He believes that the Public Concession Board should pay special attention to residents who cannot pay attention to their food.</p>

<h3>Collection of Old Tobacco and Liquor Licenses in Shanghai</h3>
<p>From July 1st, the Shanghai Bao Tobacco and Liquor Inspection Bureau Announced: Gu Daosheng, Director of the Jiangsu Shanghai Bao Chong Qi Tobacco and Liquor License Tax Inspection Bureau, previously reported that the license was to be taken over by the province, with plans to divide the area, establish bureaus, and appoint staff to go to various counties to implement the takeover. Fearing that taxpayers would not know what to do, he immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Stamp and Tobacco and Liquor Tax Office, and the Provincial General Bureau for instructions and approval. He has received instructions from all parties to handle the matter as before. The Shanghai and Bin Branch Offices are ordered to be merged and located at the original address at 381 Fumin Road, Daanmen, to continue operations. The autumn licenses will still be exchanged and taxed from July 1st. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper to various tobacco industry groups, the bureau also posted a notice stating: For the purpose of announcement, the Jiangsu Stamp and Tobacco and Liquor Tax Bureau's telegraphic order (already recorded in this newspaper, abbreviated) states that this bureau is scheduled to open for collection from July 1st at 381 Fumin Road, Daanmen, Shanghai Tobacco and Liquor License Tax Inspection Branch Office. The Binshan Branch Office will be attached to the Shanghai Office. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, it is hereby announced that tobacco and liquor merchants in Shanghai and Bao County must be aware of the news and abide by the Ministry's order, go to the branch office on time to pay taxes and obtain licenses. Do not wait and see and make a mistake. Sincerely, this is a special announcement.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Tax Bureau Telegraphic Order: The Jiangsu Stamp and Tobacco and Liquor Tax Bureau sent a telegraphic order to its subordinate branches in winter, stating: It is hereby ordered that the Ministry has ordered that the tobacco and liquor license tax has always been managed by the central government. You must handle the completion of the matter on one hand and continue to collect taxes on the other hand, without any negligence. In addition to the telegraphic order, this is a special notification.</p>
<h3>Various Industries in Jiangxi Telegraph to Request the Abolition of Production and Sales Tax</h3>
<p>Various industries in Jiangxi telegraph to the Central Government requesting the Provincial Government to abolish the production and sales tax, stating: To Lin, Chairman of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters National Government, Wang, President of the Executive Yuan, Shao, President of the Legislative Yuan, Yu, President of the Control Yuan, Jiang, Chairman of the Military Commission, Song, Minister of Finance, Chen, Minister of Industry, and He, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Zone in Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian. Jiangxi has suffered from disasters for years, and the people and property have been devastated. The market is in extreme depression. However, at this time of poverty, the Provincial Government is using the pretext of post-bandit suppression to launch a special production and sales tax on goods, setting up bureaus and cards to collect taxes, which is tantamount to a disguised likin tax. The Provincial Government only says that bandit suppression is important now, and it is impossible to cope without financial resources. However, the bandit suppression troops in Jiangxi recently have all been dispatched by the Central Government, and the expenses are borne by the national treasury. The local protection corps and police teams also have their own local special funds, so there is no need to raise additional funds. Furthermore, the National Government has repeatedly followed the will of the Prime Minister and the Central Government's orders to arbitrarily levy taxes in various provinces, and it is an infringement and violation of the law for the bandit suppression conference to act as the Legislative Yuan. The silk and satin piece goods industry association, etc., upholding the prestige of the Central Government and observing the financial resources of Jiangxi Province, believe that this kind of donation is impossible to undertake. As far as the current commercial power of Jiangxi Province is concerned, almost no industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. Even if all donations and taxes are exempted, it is still worrying. Moreover, adding such harsh taxes similar to likin, I am afraid that the public income will be limited, and the vitality of Jiangxi will be exhausted. It is hereby requested that the Central Government consider that this kind of donation is difficult to bear. In Jiangxi Province, the most important products are wood, machinery, paper, summer cloth, medicinal herbs, and oil beans. The place where these products are produced is the place where bandits are infested. The bandits have destroyed the goods, and there are no goods that can be exported. Even if there are scattered small vendors, they already feel difficult to transport, and the cost must be higher. If you add a production and sales tax, the price of the goods will be extraordinarily high, and sales will be even more difficult. It will inevitably lead to unemployment. As a result, forced by livelihood, or resulting in the flow and banditry. The goods imported from other provinces are mostly daily necessities, and foreign goods have already been taxed by the customs. The regulations of one item not being taxed twice have already been clearly stated in the Ministry's case. At this time when the whole world is strictly cutting expenditure, Jiangxi alone is launching a production and sales tax similar to likin. This is not only opposed by the entire people, but also not allowed by the laws of your (Yuan)(Seat)(Department). Moreover, the harm of evil taxes lies not in the weight but in the inequality. If the whole country is consistent, a slightly heavier levy can also be tolerated. If one has it and the other does not, or one passes and the other is heavy, merchants consider the cost, who would not choose the light and follow the heavy, and change their route. The lightness or heaviness of taxes is different, and the prosperity or decline of the market is also different. It is true that the government is raising funds for bandit suppression by running a production and sales tax, I am afraid that in the land with bandits, the bandits will not be suppressed, and in the land without bandits, the place will become more impoverished and unemployment will increase due to the operation of the production and sales tax. Benefits are not obtained, but disasters follow. Jiangxi people, first trapped by bandits, then trapped by floods, and finally forced by heavy taxes, will never have a day of rest. Speaking of this, it can be heartbreaking. The silk and satin piece goods industry association, etc., are in their own interests. A line of life was long ago sent to death by natural and man-made disasters. Even without this donation, there is already a tendency not to be able to survive. If you add likin in disguise, no matter how much the commercial power has not reached, and the hard work of cutting the likin for many years in the middle area will be abandoned in one day, opening up the evil precedent that has never been seen in all provinces and leaving endless disasters for Jiangxi. (Yuan) (Seat) (Department) is also unwilling to do so. Please, in consideration of the suffering of the people of Jiangxi, immediately order the Provincial Government to take back its orders and abolish them quickly, and I will wait for your orders with extreme urgency.

<h3>洋涇鎭創設時疫醫院</h3>
<p>A well-known Shanghai figure, Du Yuesheng, Pan Ziwen, Pan Zuoren, Ruan Shangcheng, and other gentlemen, in view of the pervasive atmosphere of epidemics after the war this year, and as the summer season arrives when all kinds of diseases flourish, and considering that the town of Yangjing is densely populated, especially with a large number of laborers, if there is no infectious disease hospital to provide relief, a sudden outbreak of epidemics would spread very quickly, causing great concern. Therefore, they have each donated large sums of money to establish the Yangjing Infectious Disease Hospital in the Bao Ren Tang of the town, and have specially hired Dr. Sun Naikang, a brilliant disciple of the famous Shanghai doctor Pang Jingzhou, as the director of the hospital, and have also hired many other doctors and nurses to be stationed in the hospital for regular consultations, and have also prepared many wards to accommodate patients. The hospital is scheduled to open on the fifth day of this month, which is good news for the people of Yangjing.</p>

<h3>Roof Collapse Claims a Life</h3>
<p>Tragedy Added to Drama</p>
<p>Peeking at a Play Proves Fatal</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou Staggers Away</p>
<p>Du Liyun Slightly Injured</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lingei United Association, for the purpose of raising funds for public welfare, held its 23rd charity opera performance at the Tianchan Stage on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon. Various opera troupes from Shanghai and Ping (Beijing) participated in the performance, and the program was slightly more extensive than usual. The finale was "Famen Temple with Grand Trial," performed by Wang Shaolou and Du Liyun, who had recently come to Shanghai from Beijing. As a result, the entire venue was packed. Around 6:30 PM, as "Famen Temple" was being performed, during the scene of Liu Jin's grand trial of prisoners, the play was nearing its end. Unexpectedly, just as the audience was focused and attentive, a loud crash was heard from the stage. A person was seen falling from the air, landing directly behind Song Qiaojiao, who was played by Du Liyun and kneeling on the ground to receive punishment. At this point, without waiting for the Emperor's interrogation, she immediately stood up and fled to the backstage. Wang Shaolou, who played the role of the magistrate of Mei County, also staggered away from the jury seat. The gongs stopped, the strings went silent, and the order on the stage was thrown into chaos. The audience below, witnessing this scene, were all shocked and horrified, and rushed from their seats toward the exit. Cries erupted, and the entire venue was in turmoil. After the managers tried their best to stop the chaos, many spectators had already been pushed and trampled, and some even fell to the ground and were injured, crying out in pain. The person who had fallen from the air was lying motionless by the side of the stage, bleeding profusely. After being moved to the backstage by the staff, he had already died and could not be saved. The deceased was about 27 or 28 years old, wearing a singlet and white trousers, resembling a worker. According to general speculation, he must have been leaning over the arched skylight on the third floor before the accident, peeking down at the play. Somehow, the glass of the skylight was suddenly shattered, and this person fell straight down through the hole, landing by the stage, lying motionless behind Du Liyun who was kneeling. As a result, Du Liyun was also slightly injured. In a split second, the skylight opened, and a great disaster occurred. The grand trial in "Famen Temple" was suddenly interrupted and became an unresolved case. The deceased was then taken to Renji Hospital by the police, where it was confirmed that his head was broken and his wrists were fractured, a truly tragic sight.</p>
<h3>Prosperous Gambling Den in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Authorities Should Strictly Prohibit It</p>
<p>The gambling dens known as "Three Treasures of Shanghai," which have been rampant for over twenty years, have always been located in the foreign concessions. Now, a large gambling house has suddenly been established in Nanshi, which is known as a clean area. It is called "Xinglong Company," and the people in charge are a gang of hooligans from Xiaodongmen: Sanbei Fan Taoluo and Chai Pian Fan, who are extraordinarily powerful and operate brazenly, with no one daring to interfere. Initially, it was located in Xuejiabang, with a sign posted on the door. Messengers on bicycles, known as "fast horses," were used to relay information, with dozens of them. Later, it moved to Rihui Port. Yesterday morning, it moved again to Guohuo Road, south of the local court, and set up numerous traps there, specializing in enticing people to gamble. According to investigations, there are now over a hundred "listening posts" (places where bets are placed) and "shipping boats" (people who collect and deliver bets) in the Nanshi area. It is estimated that after deducting all expenses, they net over one thousand yuan per day, amounting to a huge sum of thirty to forty thousand yuan per month. The reason why this gambling house moves from east to west and back again is not because it fears the authorities, but because it cannot agree on how to divide the spoils with the local hooligans, or so it is said.</p>

<h3>Wang Xiaolai Speaks on Civil War and Commerce</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, spoke on "Abolishing Civil War and Commerce" at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA the other day. His speech is as follows:</p>
<p>I am honored to have been invited by the YMCA today to give a speech and have pre-selected a topic called "Civil War and Commerce." The issue of abolishing civil war is indeed an important one at present. However, the harms of civil war have been discussed repeatedly in recent years, and the insightful and incisive arguments have already been so numerous that they could fill many volumes. What more can I say? Therefore, the YMCA's request has put me in a difficult position. The two words "civil war" have a very clear meaning. But what exactly is the meaning of the word "征" (zheng, to levy, to campaign)? According to the traditional Chinese interpretation, all uses of force by the government to maintain order and discipline in the country, and to suppress rebellions in a certain area, are called "征" and not "戰" (zhan, war). Therefore, in ancient China, there were sayings such as "The army of the king has campaigns but not wars," "Campaigns are when the superior attacks the inferior; enemy states do not campaign against each other," and "Rituals, music, campaigns, and expeditions all originate from the emperor." These phrases can prove the definition of the word "征". So how is the word "戰" explained? Mencius said, "Fighting for land results in corpses filling the fields, fighting for a city results in corpses filling the city." He also said, "In the Spring and Autumn period, there were no righteous wars. One side may have been slightly better than the other." Therefore, all actions that aim to annex other people's land to expand one's own desires, and that involve mobilizing troops, regardless of what pretext they are using, are called "戰". In recent years, the Zhili-Anhui War, the Fengtian-Zhili War, and the Qi-Lu War all fall into this category. The ancient Chinese were very careful in their use of words. Later, the meaning of the word "戰" became too broad. Therefore, when the movement to abolish civil war was launched, many people said that there should be a distinction. For example, the work of suppressing bandits cannot be abolished under the name of "civil war," otherwise, wouldn't the whole of China become like the situation of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng during the late Ming Dynasty? Similarly, arrogant and powerful generals who control a region cannot be condoned under the pretext of abolishing civil war. Otherwise, wouldn't the whole country permanently become like the situation of the Tang Dynasty with its regional warlords? Therefore, what I want to discuss today are these two points: First, can our country still prolong the civil war? There must be a small number of people who say, "What's wrong with that? The endless civil wars in our country, according to historical precedents, are a necessary process, a natural trend. Leaving aside other eras, just counting from the time of the Ming-Qing transition, the civil wars that occurred, starting from the first year of Emperor Zhuanglie's reign until the pacification of Taiwan in the 22nd year of Emperor Kangxi's reign, lasted for a full 57 years. This proves that only war can stop war, and there is a certain trend that cannot be eliminated solely through prayerful or appealing calls. After this period, after a period of recuperation and recovery, it will still be a strong country. Isn't the era of Kangxi and Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty a very good example?" I dare to say boldly that there must be some military men who have this in mind, but they are too embarrassed to say it out loud. Otherwise, why do they keep advocating for disarmament with their mouths, while their hands are unwilling to let go? I think these people are completely wrong. (1) The current civil war, due to the interference of foreign forces and the protection of the concessions, which serve as a retreat, has never been fought thoroughly. To imagine fighting it out clearly like in the past is absolutely impossible. Therefore, the saying "stopping war with war" is no longer applicable now. (2) The weapons of war are not as simple as they used to be, and the cost of war is not as low as it used to be. Therefore, during the war between Zeng Guofan and the Taiping rebels, the time was not short, but when the accounts were settled after the war, the military expenses amounted to only over 20 million taels of silver. The only source of military funds was the likin tax, which was sufficient to supply the needs. Unlike the current situation, where 1.1 billion yuan in public bonds have been raised in the past few years, and that's not even the end of it. The provinces are collecting tobacco taxes and pre-collecting land taxes. There is simply no perfect place in the country. As the saying goes, "scraping the bones to suck the marrow." Now, we have reached the point where there are no bones to scrape and no marrow to suck. If we continue to prolong the war, where will the war expenses come from? (3) Because of the twenty years of civil war, we have lost Outer Mongolia, Tibet, and the three Northeastern provinces. The area where the six provinces of Henan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, and Jiangxi meet has become the base camp for bandits. If the civil war is prolonged, how many more Northeastern provinces will we have left? The base camp for bandits can expand indefinitely! Therefore, I advise the contemporary military men not to dream of military unification in history. Second, regarding the need to suppress the arrogant and powerful generals who control a region, I must first ask how these arrogant and powerful generals came to be. When Yuan Shikai first came to power, everyone obeyed his orders, and no one dared to overstep their bounds. Later, because of his ambition to restore the monarchy and to gain the favor of the generals, he inevitably resorted to perfunctory means. Therefore, by the end of his reign, some provinces had already become unmanageable. Later, when Feng Guozhang succeeded him, he wanted to use the Southwest to control the Anhui clique. When Xu Shichang took over, he wanted to use the struggle between the Anhui and Zhili cliques to reap the benefits. Because of his own position, the situation of civil war has been ongoing since then, and has not yet ended. The subsequent political situations were almost the same, so I won't go into detail. Another point is that if the rulers are arrogant, extravagant, and licentious, and favor their relatives and old friends, then the military men in the provinces will become envious, thinking that if he can do this in the country, then I can do it in a province. Moreover, they may even invoke the historical term of "military remonstrance" and aspire to take his place. Therefore, the formation of regional control can be summarized in two simple sentences: If you want to play off one party against another, then they will seize the opportunity and not obey the national law. If you want to put your private interest before the country, then they will put their private interest before the province. To eliminate this source of chaos, the rulers must set a good example themselves and create a good atmosphere in order to reverse the situation. Confucius had a saying, "Governing means being upright. If you lead with uprightness, who would dare to be unrighteous?" This is the motto for eliminating civil war today. Simply relying on the use of force is like pouring water on a fire. You think the past punitive expeditions have only killed hundreds of thousands of soldiers and millions of civilians, and it has nothing to do with them. They will seize the opportunity to make a comeback. Therefore, I say that some people say that the abolition of civil war should not involve the suppression of arrogant and powerful generals. This statement simply does not make sense. Because in this way, the talk of abolishing civil war simply cannot begin. The movement to abolish civil war is the demand of the entire nation, not just the demand of a part of the merchants. Saying that civil war is detrimental to commerce is not as accurate as saying that civil war is detrimental to the people's livelihood. Our country is an agricultural nation. As a result of years of civil war, the able-bodied men in the countryside have been conscripted into the army or forced into labor. The fields are left barren, and no one is planting them. In many places, they tell you to pull up the good crops and plant opium seedlings. If you don't obey them, they will also charge you a "lazy tax". Therefore, the harm of civil war is most widespread and deeply felt by the farmers. Recently, the reason why the whole country has become famine-stricken and bandit-ridden can be simply attributed to the fact that the farmers have no food to eat. In the history of our country since the Qin Dynasty, it is inevitable that the farmers will be forced to a dead end, and then a single cry in the night will lead to widespread chaos. Now, whatever ideologies are in vogue are nothing more than taking advantage of this high tide of farmer unemployment. Therefore, I originally wanted to revise today's topic and change it to "Abolishing Civil War and the People's Livelihood." However, Mr. Liu (Zhanen) and Mr. Shen (Sizhuang) have already published on this topic. Therefore, I have to talk more about the relationship between abolishing civil war and commerce. What commerce needs first is capital. However, because of the civil war, capital is concentrated in public bonds, so it is impossible for commerce to seek low-interest financing. Because of the insecurity of order in the interior, cash is concentrated in a few big cities, creating a phenomenon where officials are sated and want to die, while dwarfs are hungry and want to die. To seek capital to circulate throughout the country and provide funds for the general merchants is impossible. Therefore, the first fatal blow of civil war to merchants is the lack of capital. What commerce needs second is transportation. In recent years, many of the vehicles on the roads were moved out of the Guanhai during the civil war. Later, when Panjin and Jinzhou were successively lost, almost all of them were confiscated by the Japanese. It is said that there are about 1,200 vehicles in total. Many have been damaged during the war, and many are still being requisitioned by the army. Therefore, all roads feel a great shortage of vehicles. Because of the scarcity of vehicles, the railway bureaus have poor business, and freight rates naturally cannot be reduced. Therefore, someone investigated the coal from North China being transported to Shanghai, and its value exceeds that of Fushun coal and Kailuan coal by two times. We have no choice but to let Fushun coal and Kailuan coal dominate the market. Therefore, the second fatal blow of civil war to merchants is the interruption of transportation. What commerce needs third is light taxes. However, this is absolutely impossible to achieve under the continuous civil war. Because to use troops, we must raise more troops, and to raise more troops, we must raise more money. These two tasks are inseparable. Now, the likin tax has been nominally abolished. However, Sichuan Province has never been able to do it. In Hebei Province, after the abolition of the likin tax, it was replaced by another name, called the special consumption tax. What about Guangdong? There is also the Special Bureau for Piece Goods and Foreign Goods Tax. Jiangxi has recently established a production and sales tax, and Jiangsu has also established a special business tax. These are all disguised likin taxes, which almost everyone knows. Therefore, the third fatal blow of civil war to merchants is heavy taxes. What commerce needs fourth is sales channels. Sales channels depend on the purchasing power of the people. Now, in the nine provinces of Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan and others, the people have either turned into bandits or become famine victims. These people of course have no purchasing power. I think there are at least 100 million people in this situation. In other words, it can be said that the country has suddenly lost 100 million people to sell goods to. If you calculate carefully, what is the extent of the merchant's loss? Therefore, the fourth fatal blow of civil war to merchants is the lack of sales channels. After talking for a long time, how exactly should we start to eliminate civil war? We do not advocate stopping war with war, nor do we advocate prayerful or appealing movements. The rulers should rectify themselves and set an example, so that the subordinates' conspiracies to seize and plunder will naturally disappear. On the other hand, the people should also clearly distinguish right from wrong and create a serious public opinion to reverse the atmosphere. Recently, the common malpractice of the people is that they verbally reject warlords, but in their hearts they depend on warlords. When a warlord comes to power, they are full of compliments and try their best to ingratiate themselves. When a warlord falls out of power, they hope that he will come back to power and support him. Many even want to partner with him to run businesses. Therefore, they act recklessly and are simply not subject to any sanctions in society. No wonder they are so unscrupulous. During the time of the Donglin Society and Fushe in the late Ming Dynasty, the scholar-officials attached themselves to the eunuchs, embezzled money, and perverted the law. When they returned to their hometowns, they were simply not considered human. Therefore, they always felt a little afraid. To put it bluntly, it was using the power of society to deprive them of their personal rights. Therefore, there used to be a saying, "The Ming people loved fame, and the Qing people loved profit." It can be seen that the atmosphere of the previous era was much better than it is now because there was a serious public opinion. Gu Tinglin once said, "Observing how the Five Dynasties could be transformed into the Northern Song Dynasty, one knows that there is no style in the world that cannot be reversed." Therefore, in our abolition of civil war, it is better to unite and strive to create a serious public opinion and a good atmosphere to influence and transform those warlords who harm the people and the country, rather than to overthrow the warlords who harm the people and the country. Furthermore, the people should arm themselves, and each village should establish a local militia, striving for self-government. In peacetime, they can prevent bandits. In wartime, they can defend their homes. If the militia can be popularized throughout the country, then the military force will not be monopolized by the warlords, and civil war will not occur. This is a fundamental solution, and I hope everyone will make a real effort.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan's Report on Flood Relief</h3>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>C. Agricultural Rehabilitation</p>
<p>The Agricultural Rehabilitation Office hired Mr. Wang Zhixin as the director to handle its affairs. The original plan for agricultural rehabilitation was to allocate 50,000 tons of relief wheat and 5 million yuan in cash to establish agricultural rehabilitation management offices in each disaster area, using a loan method, with the aim of revolving the funds annually as a basic for long-term assistance to rural areas. However, due to the government's insufficient financial resources, the 5 million yuan in cash was not available. Also, due to the different situations in each province, the method of use was slightly changed. Now, I will list the main points as follows: (1) Jiangsu: The original plan for agricultural rehabilitation in Jiangsu was 10,000 tons of American wheat. Initially, the Provincial Department of Industry borrowed 1,400 tons to distribute as seed wheat. Then, the Jiangsu Provincial Government borrowed 7,000 tons to repair the Yunhe (Grand Canal) levee. (Among the original 10,000 tons borrowed, 3,000 tons were allocated by the Industrial Rehabilitation Office). Only 70 tons of wheat were actually distributed to disaster-stricken farmers by Commissioner Ling Daoyang of the Ning (Nanjing) District. Now, 1,530 tons of wheat should still be allocated. Currently, there is an urgent need for funds for the repair work. The project is on the verge of failure. It is proposed to lend this American wheat to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to complete the unfinished work. When it is recovered in the future, it will be used as a long-term revolving relief fund for rural areas, according to the original plan. (2) Anhui: Anhui is divided into northern Anhui, central Anhui, and southern Anhui. Generally, the most severely affected areas reach 48 counties. Previously, 10,000 tons of wheat were allocated to be handled by the China International Famine Relief Commission, with 6,300 tons for central and southern Anhui and 3,500 tons for northern Anhui. It is now proposed to allocate an additional 1,800 tons, because the disaster is so widespread and large. The reason for entrusting it to the China International Famine Relief Commission is that the work expenses are not to be paid by this association, and its management personnel have experienced staff who have handled rural cooperatives in the northern provinces. (3) Jiangxi: Only 12 counties in Jiangxi were affected by the disaster and received relief. Therefore, 5,000 tons of agricultural rehabilitation wheat were allocated, also entrusted to the China International Famine Relief Commission for handling. (4) Hubei: The Hubei Agricultural Rehabilitation Management Office was established, with Mr. He Hengfu hired as the manager. The original plan was to lend the agricultural rehabilitation wheat according to the regulations in order to implement long-term revolving relief. It is estimated that 10,000 tons of relief wheat will be allocated. (5) Hunan: 10,000 tons of relief wheat were allocated, entrusted to the Hunan branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission for handling. However, its operating expenses will be funded by this association. The method is also based on the rural cooperative method of Anhui and Jiangxi. The difficulty of agricultural rehabilitation is less than that of industrial rehabilitation, but because of the limited funds and the large demand for loans, it is inevitable that some people will be resentful at present. The important point is to recover and preserve the funds on schedule and to revolve the relief efforts. Its future complexities are also not insignificant. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Silk and Satin Printing Association Sends Letter Requesting Silk and Satin Industry to Exercise Caution in Printing</h3>
<p>Preventing Deception by Shameless Solicitors: The Shanghai Silk and Satin Printing Industry Association sent a formal letter yesterday to the Silk and Satin Industry Association of this city, saying (the preceding part omitted): When the January 28th Incident occurred, our 19th Route Army bravely resisted, their blood staining Shanghai, their great achievements shaking the world. Ultimately, they received no assistance, and their efforts fell short. All who have blood in their veins cannot but feel grief. But since we lack strong armor and sharp weapons to eliminate the brutal enemy, the only way to prevent the demise of our nation is through our own awareness. If we can be of one mind and one heart, resist Japan, strengthen our defenses, clear the fields, be pragmatic and realistic, put the enemy in a desperate situation, and avenge the deep hatred of our nation, it will be as easy as turning one's hand. However, individual actions are minimally effective, while united action amplifies our power. The members of our industry are extremely complex, and verbal condemnation is insufficient, while written attacks are ineffective. We find dealing with those boorish slaves particularly thorny. But with the rise and fall of the nation, every man is responsible. We must not let tears dry and shame be forgotten. Therefore, we, the members of this association, respectfully and sincerely approach your esteemed association with the grief of Qin Ting. We urge you to notify all silk shops in this city to cherish their patriotic enthusiasm, remember the pain of being enslaved, and cooperate to lend a helping hand. In the future, when issuing prints for silk fabrics, you must exercise extreme caution. Strictly reject any printing solicitors with unclear backgrounds or lacking credible guarantees. This will allow us to coordinate our efforts and achieve success in resisting Japan. If there are still any conscienceless individuals who betray their country and recognize the enemy as their father, devising cunning schemes to deceive your esteemed shops and undermine the patriotic movement, then we, the members of this association, and your esteemed shops will have done our human best and can declare ourselves innocent. Those who value profit over righteousness will surely suffer moral condemnation from their own consciences and be subjected to the public anger of society. We hope you will consider and accept our humble sincerity. This will not only be something for which we, the members of this association, will be endlessly grateful, but also something that the compatriots of the entire nation will bless from the bottom of their hearts (the following part omitted).</p>
<h3>Big Gambling Den in Hujia Muqiao Fined</h3>
<p>The large gambling den organized by the traitor Hu Lifu and others in Huaxing Lane, Hujia Muqiao, Hongkou, was raided by the Public Security Bureau's detective team and handed over to the local court. The circumstances were reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the court's investigation revealed that those arrested were entirely workers from nearby factories. Therefore, they were all prosecuted for gambling with money. Yesterday, Judge Huang sentenced 111 gambling offenders to a fine of 40 yuan each as a warning.</p>
<h3>Assassination of Ling Runxiang Case: Defendants Transferred to First Special Court for Continued Trial</h3>
<p>All defendants Recanted Original Confessions: Five Guangdong natives, Qu Zhaocheng, Liu Xizhuang, Luo Baoliang, Qu Chang, and Qu Chuntong, were involved in the assassination of Ling Runxiang, a Cantonese and the head of the Criminal Division of the C District of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, which occurred around 10 p.m. on July 26th of the previous year at the entrance of Dexing Lane on North Jiangxi Road. They allegedly instigated the crime with 400 yuan and directed the fugitive Hu Ying, Pan Qi, and others to shoot and kill him. After the incident, they were arrested at the Guang Wu Tai Theater on Qiujiang Road and sent to the Garrison Headquarters. Qu Zhaocheng was sentenced to life imprisonment as a military offender, while Liu Xizhuang and others were sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and sent to the capital for execution. Later, the families of the defendants hired lawyers to present their case to the Ministry of Military Affairs, which revoked the original judgment and sent it back to the Jiangyin Local Court for retrial. Since the crime scene and the convicted criminals were all in the Shanghai International Settlement, the court sent Qu and the other four to Shanghai. They were interrogated once by the Hongkou Police Station and the First Special District Court. Details were reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin presided over a continued hearing at the First Court. Police Station lawyer Zhang Tianyin detailed the events and presented testimonies from Ling's wife, Zhang, and the convict Lu Ju, who had been sentenced to ten years, which were consistent with the previous statements. Qu Zhaocheng was questioned, claiming that he had been friends with Ling Runxiang for over ten years and had no animosity towards him. He completely denied the various testimonies given by Lu Ju and the deceased Mo Yang in the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Second Branch Court of Appeal, including the alleged gathering at the Sanyuan Temple on North Sichuan Road to discuss killing a chicken and swearing an oath, and paying Hu Ying to carry out the assassination. Liu Xizhuang testified that he did not know Qu Zhaocheng or the convict Mo Yang and had no animosity towards Ling Runxiang. He denied the gathering at the Sanyuan Temple, stating that it was not true. Luo Baoliang testified that he had only arrived in Shanghai from his hometown about twenty days before the Ling case occurred. Mo Yang falsely accused him at the Public Security Bureau, but he did not know Mo Yang. He had already stated this at the Bureau. Qu Chang testified that Qu Zhaocheng was not his paternal uncle and that he did not know Mo Yang. They shared the same surname but were not from the same clan, and their villages were more than ten miles apart. He claimed that Mo Yang's testimony was entirely false. The court presented the various testimonies given by Mo Yang and others at the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Court of Appeal and questioned the defendants closely. They all denied the accusations. The court then ordered Qu Zhaocheng (also known as Ou Zhaocheng) and the other four defendants to be remanded in custody and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<h3>Wife Has Affair, Husband Attacks with Knife</h3>
<p>Duan Zhang, a woman from Changzhou, is sixteen years old. Last year, she married Duan Hanqing, a man from Hubei, through a matchmaker. Duan works as a laborer at the Fufeng Flour Mill at 25 Moganshan Road, so the couple lived together in the Fufeng workshop. Zhang worked as a female worker at the Nisshin Cotton Mill No. 6. For a year, the couple lived in harmony. However, recently, Duan heard rumors that his wife was acting improperly and was having an affair with a worker surnamed Jia from the same factory. He secretly investigated. The day before yesterday, at about 9:00, Duan discovered that his wife was again meeting Jia secretly in the Fufeng workshop. He became enraged, took a knife, and broke into the room, slashing his wife Zhang twice, causing injuries to both her arms and causing her to bleed profusely. Someone called the police, and Constable Yin of Precinct 395 and Detective Ma Jinbiao arrived and arrested Duan, taking him to the Putuo Road Police Station for detention. Zhang was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Station lawyer Qian Xunjiu recounted the previous events, stating that the victim, Duan Zhang, was still being treated in the hospital, so the Police Station had not formally filed charges in the case. He requested permission to detain Duan for further investigation. Judge Ge Cixun approved the request after briefly questioning Duan and ordered him to be detained for a week for further review.</p>
<h3>Trial of Jealousy Murder Case</h3>
<p>Yao Guishan's Life in Danger</p>
<p>Wang Wan Confesses to Forced Adultery</p>
<p>Wan Zhen Da, 26, the wife of Wang Xingsheng, a carpenter from Wangjiazhai, 2 Gaolang Bridge, Yangshupu, had an affair with Yao Guishan, a rattan craftsman and neighbor, four years ago. This March, Yao tricked Wan into going to Zhoupu, Pudong. Wang went to find her and brought her back. Recently,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Yao repeatedly pressured her to abandon her family, leave her husband and children, and live with him. His harassment did not stop. When Wang found out, he conceived the idea of killing Yao. The day before yesterday afternoon, knowing that Yao had again arranged to meet his wife at the Bund, Wang carried a Browning pistol and followed them south. In front of No. 33 Yuxing Street, outside the Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, he saw Yao and his wife Wan walking together. Wang immediately drew his gun and fired two shots at Yao's back, hitting Yao in the waist, causing him to fall to the ground. Wang and his wife hired two rickshaws and tried to escape, but they were chased and apprehended by Chinese and foreign detectives. Wang and Wan were taken to the police station for questioning, and a pistol and seven bullets were found on them. Yao Guishan, who had been injured, was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The details were reported in yesterday's newspapers. It is reported that Yao's injuries are quite serious, and his life may be in danger. Yesterday morning, the police sent Wang Xingsheng and Wang Wan to the Second Special District Court, where Criminal Court President Wang Xu and clerk Zhu Chengzhu presided over the trial at the First Criminal Court. First, police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case, saying that the police had not yet conducted a detailed investigation of the case due to the limited time, requesting the court to postpone the hearing for two weeks to investigate the matter before holding another interrogation, and presenting the pistol and bullets as evidence. Yao Guishan's father, Yao Jia Hai, appeared in court, stating that his son Guishan had been shot by Wang and requesting severe punishment. Lawyer Zhang Ji defended the defendants. First, Wang Wan was interrogated, confessing that she had an affair with Yao Guishan. Because Yao repeatedly forced her to abandon her husband and children to live with him, she refused. On the eighth day of the first month of this year, he came with a gun to threaten her. If she did not do as he wished, he would kill one of the three of them. She tricked him into putting down the gun and hid it at her mother's house. This March, Yao led her to Zhoupu, but her husband came to find her and brought her back. Now Yao is threatening her again, so she told her husband, who retrieved the gun from her mother and killed Yao yesterday afternoon. Wang Xingsheng was then interrogated, confessing that Yao had an affair with his wife. He first learned of it in October of last year. This March, Yao abducted his wife to Zhoupu in Pudong. He went to find her and brought her back. Afterwards, Yao repeatedly harassed them and pressured his wife to live with him, so he retrieved the gun from his mother-in-law and learned that Yao had arranged to meet his wife at the Bund yesterday. He followed them with the gun to kill Yao. At the scene of the incident, he asked his wife whom she was helping. When his wife did not answer, he fired two shots at Yao. The gun belonged to Yao, who had committed two robberies before. He had decided to kill Yao on his own and had not discussed it with his wife beforehand. The court reviewed the confessions and ordered a postponement to await news of the victim's condition before holding another hearing. It was ordered that the hearing be continued at 10:00 a.m. on the 18th of this month, and the defendants were temporarily detained at the police station.</p>
<h3>Widening of Customs Wharf</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has approved a plan to widen the Customs Wharf along the Huangpu River. However, it must wait until an agreement is reached with the neighboring landowners before proceeding. This matter originated from a request by the Harmonious Merchants Association to improve the convenience of passengers embarking and disembarking. Therefore, the Commissioner of Public Works of the Municipal Council consulted with the Customs to propose widening the current wharf on both the north and south sides, so as to increase the ground area by 10,000 square feet. However, such a method would inevitably overlap with the adjacent banks, so it is necessary to obtain the consent of the respective landowners. As for the construction costs, they will be borne entirely by the Customs.</p>
<p>During the discussion of this matter in the Public Works Committee, the Commissioner of Public Works stated that while such widening would greatly facilitate the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers' luggage, the Customs would still need to find other ways to inspect the goods in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. However, if the inspection of goods were moved elsewhere, merchants might object. After discussion, the committee recognized that this proposal would benefit the public and approved the widening plan. However, the Municipal Council and the Customs must obtain the consent of the neighboring landowners, and the Customs is requested to use this area entirely for the inspection of luggage and inspect goods elsewhere. This suggestion has been approved by the Board of Directors on June 29th.</p>
<h3>Sister and Brother Sleep at Opposite Ends</h3>
<p>Living Together in Apartment Not Adultery</p>
<p>Original Request for Bail, Then Mediation</p>
<p>Shang Qingyun, 46, a Shandong native who runs a towel factory at No. 1 Dakang Lane, Jishan Temple Street, inside the Xinbeimen, became involved with the prostitute Lin Guifeng (i.e., Shang Lin) ten years ago. He paid 250 yuan to redeem Guifeng and took her as a concubine. However, as Guifeng's beauty faded slightly, Shang married another young concubine outside and neglected Guifeng. Therefore, on the third day of last month, Guifeng took her clothes and other belongings and went to live with her younger brother, Lin Genbao, in the Oriental Apartment on Beile Road in the French Concession. She planned to hire a lawyer to send a letter to Shang Qingyun, requesting a maintenance fee of 10,000 yuan. After Lin left, Shang Qingyun searched everywhere for her without success. Until recently, he saw Lin Guifeng and a young man living together in the Oriental Apartment, leading a double life. He reported to the Songshan Road Police Station that she had absconded and committed adultery, and Detective Qi De arrested the two defendants and took them to the police station. After questioning, the police chief learned that the case was inland and transferred it to the First Section of the Second District. Chief Xu questioned the plaintiff, who repeated the previous statements. Shang Lin stated that the plaintiff had broken his previous promise and嫌我色衰,另娶年轻小星,屡次將我虐待毆打無異,逼我自走,故我祇携自已衣服,暫與胞弟林根寳同住公寓,並非姦夫,原告亦知林根寳爲胞弟,且糼時曾爲讀書薦生意,現親母尙在浙江,可傳來嫡血等語,據林根寳供,年二十一歲,浙江人,林桂鳳係我胞姊,今雖同開一房間,然分睡兩頭,並無通姦情事,徐所長訊得有和姦行爲,判解法院訊辦,不料原被告奉判後,卽共同請求交保調解云</p>
<h3>Brave Women Catch Thief</h3>
<p>Suffers Serious Injury, Will Become Disabled</p>
<p>Holds One Thief and Sends to County for Prosecution</p>
<p>Lu Arong, a tenant farmer in Xiaolujiazhai, Liuhe, has a poor family. His daily life is difficult, and his home is extremely simple. Unexpectedly, at about 9:00 the night before last, six or seven robbers, each armed with a sharp weapon, broke into the house, ordering everyone to be silent and searching everywhere. Lu Arong and his family of four, including his wife and daughter, were startled and got up to bravely catch the thieves. The thieves immediately attacked with sharp weapons, causing serious injuries to all four members of the Lu family. The wife held onto one thief and refused to let go, and her arm bone was broken by the thief, leaving her disabled. At that time, Lu Arong, with his brute strength, managed to hold onto the thief while shouting for help. Neighbors heard the alarm and helped to catch the thief. Most of the other thieves had already fled. The arrested thief was handed over to the Liuhe security team and transferred to the county government for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Hawker Quarrels with Father, Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Yin Chongkun, 22, a native of Changzhou, lived on Qiwupu Road in East Shanghai and worked as a hawker. On the first of this month, after a slight quarrel with his father, Yin Chouxin, he went out alone and secretly bought opium to commit suicide. Someone noticed and sent him to the Xiaoshadu Road Labor Hospital, but he died despite treatment. The hospital reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then sent to the Ferren Road Mortuary. Yesterday morning, Li Ying, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, was dispatched to the mortuary to examine the body and take statements. Yin Chouxin, the father of the deceased, stated that his son had told him that he wanted to marry. He replied that because the current economic situation was extremely difficult, he would wait until he had saved some money before allowing him to marry. Upon hearing this, his son went out and later took opium. Li, after receiving the statement, ruled that the deceased, Yin Chongkun, had committed suicide by taking opium. The body was handed over to the father, Yin Chouxin, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Symposium of the Youth Life Society</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the number of members of the Youth Life Society has been increasing daily. The inaugural issue of the Youth Life Weekly, compiled by the society, was published on the 2nd of this month with the Morning Post. The content is quite substantial. It is learned that the society held its first symposium yesterday (the 4th) at 3:00 p.m. at the Atlantic Western Restaurant. Over forty people attended, including Ms. Zhang Yunhe.

<h3>Volume Four of Feitang Report to be Printed</h3>
<p>The manuscript for Volume Four of Judge Feitang's report has been received by the Municipal Council. This volume discusses the details of the internal organization and procedures, and it does not appear to be of equal interest to the public as the previous volumes. Therefore, the Municipal Council plans to print only 1,000 copies of the English version and 500 copies of the Chinese version.</p>
<h3>Creation of the Three Friends Benevolent Society</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Chinese people have realized that the fundamental way to save the country is to use domestic goods. Numerous organizations have been formed, such as the Domestic Goods Use Society and the Frugality and National Salvation Society. However, the use of domestic goods first lies in frugality and self-restraint, and the tendency of people's hearts towards goodness is the basis of frugality. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, in view of this, has formed the Three Friends Benevolent Society with Wu Shan, Xiang Kangyuan, Chen Xiaodie, Jiang Xiaojian, Qian Shouting, and others. In order to broaden the benefits, no membership fees are charged. Any group of three people can join the association as members.</p>
<h3>Go Competition</h3>

<h3>Yu Jiaxiang Practices Law</h3>
<p>Yu Jiaxiang, styled Huanru, is a native of Shangyu. After graduating from Zhejiang College of Politics and Law, he served in the legal circles of Zhejiang and Hubei provinces. He was known for his competence and reputation. He has been in seclusion for the past ten years. Recently, at the urging of close friends, Yu has agreed to practice law again. It is heard that he has set up an office at No. 96 Beijing Road and has begun working.</p>
<h3>Chinese Run Steel Fine Products Factory</h3>
<p>Various utensils made of steel (i.e., aluminum) are popular with Chinese people because they are smooth and delicate, rust-free, and easy to carry. The sales volume has been very large in recent years. Unfortunately, most of them are imported. There are not many factories in China that manufacture them. Mr. Huang, who studied at a vocational school and later worked at a factory in Zhabei for many years, is particularly skilled in the manufacture of aluminum products. He has founded a steel fine daily necessities factory. He has a ready-made factory base. In the future, his products will surely sell well. It is hoped that those who advocate domestic goods will promote cooperation and collaboration, which will be especially welcome.</p>
<h3>Record of Meeting of Colleagues of the General Affairs Department of the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>The colleagues of the General Affairs Department of the Commercial Press held a members' meeting at the Old YMCA at 1:00 p.m. on the 3rd of this month. A chairman was publicly elected, and the purpose of the meeting was reported. The cashier and accountant reported on the income and expenses of money and the existing amounts. The proposed matters were: (1) The dismissal agreement signed by the representatives of this association has not been approved by the general meeting of members or the board of directors, so it is proposed to resolutely deny it. (2) Since the January 28th Shanghai War, the situation has been chaotic, and finances have been exhausted. The colleagues, adhering to the spirit of labor-capital cooperation, first received 17.8% of their retirement salary and half a month's severance pay to maintain their livelihoods. Now the situation has stabilized, the economy is circulating, the company has resumed business, and it is actively proceeding. The suffering experienced by colleagues in recent months is difficult to describe in writing, so it is proposed to request the company to make up for the 82.2% of the retirement salary and the five and a half months of severance pay (according to the East China standard). (3) The company's accounts have always been finalized at the end of the solar year. The war broke out on January 28, 1922, so the bonuses for the year 1921 should be paid by the company as usual. (4) Representatives Wang Shoukang and Dong Yunting signed the agreement without the permission of the general meeting beforehand, and they did not convene a general meeting afterwards to report on the progress. Unilateral private agreements are extremely illegal and absolutely denied. (5) Now that the association's affairs are tense, directors should be elected to assist in the management. (Resolution) All of the above five proposals were unanimously passed by the general meeting and handed over to the board of directors for implementation. Three additional directors were elected. After tea and snacks, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Christian Warning Conference</h3>
<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church is holding a warning conference every night at 7:30 p.m. at No. 35 Laobazi Road to address the problem of social and economic panic. For several days, Chinese and Western speakers have been discussing the origins and consequences of modern-day disputes, as well as the truth, path, and life that Jesus Christ pointed out as the savior of humanity today, and the signs of the end times. At the same time, valuable films, which are not ordinary, are being shown to help understand what is being taught. The health sanatorium branch run by the church is located next to the church. With the spirit of love and sacrifice, it serves the society. In view of the hot weather, the sanatorium has specially dispatched several nurses to the church to provide care for temporary relief, which is very convenient. It is hoped that all people will not miss the opportunity.</p>

<h3>Swindler's New Method of Stealing Money</h3>
<p>The police warn: Recently, a Chinese man, about 33 years old, about 5 feet 7 inches tall, of medium build, wearing a gray gown, and speaking with a Shanghai accent, has been stealing money from customers at various banks. His method is to throw a fake bill near the customer when they are counting money at the counter, and then tell them that they have dropped a bill on the ground. While the customer bends down to pick it up, the swindler takes the opportunity to steal all or part of the money on the counter and escapes.</p>
<h3>Two-Foot Dwarf Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dwarf Xingxin, a native of Tongcheng, Anhui, is 21 years old. He is one foot shorter than the three-foot dwarfs seen on the street, just like a child. His parents are still alive. The strangest thing is that when the dwarf has to go out, his father always carries him wrapped in a large piece of cloth, fearing that he will be surrounded by passersby. He sits on the table and eats. He will soon be going to the Great World to compare his height with tall people.</p>

<h3>The Chiang Tao Wedding</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The news of Chiang Kai-shek and Tao Jingying's wedding, with Hu Shih as the officiant, has attracted much attention since it was announced in this newspaper. Whether this matter is appropriate or not, and whether it should be done or not, the world will have its own judgment, and there is no need for me to evaluate it again. Today, I will explain the words of Mr. Chiang and Mr. Hu.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang's insightful and famous saying, "struggling out a path of life from the obligations of love," means that since there is love, one should fulfill some obligations. But how should these obligations be fulfilled? This marriage is probably what Mr. Chiang calls the obligations of love. Some say that Mr. Chiang already had a wife and children, but he abandoned them to marry Ms. Tao, and many people feel sorry for his wife. In fact, Mr. Chiang had already said that marriage is an obligation of love. Although Mr. Chiang's ex-wife already had children, Mr. Chiang had also married her, so Mr. Chiang's obligations have been fulfilled. What else is there to say?</p>
<p>However, Mr. Chiang said, "struggling out a path of life." In fact, Mr. Chiang has struggled out two paths. I am afraid Mr. Chiang has forgotten one. One is indeed a path of life struggled out, and the other is a path of death struggled out. Ms. Tao has a path of life, so isn't his wife with children a path of death? Therefore, I say that Mr. Chiang only saw the long path of life in front of him, but did not see the short path of death behind him.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Hu praising his "courage," some people also say that he should not. In fact, complimenting Mr. Chiang with the word "courage" is extremely appropriate. For this matter, others do not need to do it, dare not do it, and cannot bear to do it, but Mr. Chiang did it resolutely. What is it if not courage? Decades of conjugal love, disregarded; years of friendship, disregarded; children, disregarded; public reason, disregarded; private feelings, also disregarded. What else can we call such a person if not courageous?</p>
<p>There is another meaning. The Communist Party originally had a system of communal property and communal wives. Now, Mr. Chiang's approach, although nominally establishing a monogamous system, is actually breaking the monogamous system. To put it a step further, it is communal wives. Because abandoning a wife and remarrying is not only not prohibited by law, but also regarded as a matter of course. Everyone is happy to abandon their yellow-faced wives at home and find a young and beautiful modern woman to fulfill their obligations. Isn't this a very interesting thing? So, what is the value of such a marriage?</p>
<p>This matter is small, but it is not just about Mr. Chiang personally, or about one family. If you think about it, it is actually very important. Therefore, I am talking about Mr. Chiang today.</p>

<h3>Lament for Wusong</h3>
<p>— Bao Yi</p>
<p>Returning to the old draft of "A Voyage around the Yellow Sea" Reissue. A hundred miles of Wusong grass does not bring spring, how can one bear a weary voyage around the Yellow Sea? Xiaodong (Shanghai) puts all his hopes on this solitary venture, the farthest north frontier is stained with enemy dust. Jia Yi's writing only brings tears, but could Zhao Cuo's strategy save the day? In times of chaos, how can one retell from the beginning, only to see new war bones on the vast river.</p>
<h3>Impressed by the Guangdong Incident</h3>
<p>— Wu Dexiong</p>
<p>The bones of those who died heroically in Shanghai have not yet cooled, how can we bear to see the war drums start in Guangdong? The dragon worries about the destruction of our homeland, like Geng Xin mourning the times with tears.</p>
<p>Du Fu felt so much for his country and family, what's the use of fighting to destroy Tongshan? The ants endlessly weep climbing the chariot, unbearable to reread the song "Picking Ferns".</p>

<h3>Copper and Iron Engraving Method</h3>
<p>— Jian Yinglou</p>
<p>Engraving is originally a very interesting art. For example, ordinary seals, antiques, ritual vessels, and cultural relics, relying solely on the engraver's ingenuity, can be carved into various exquisite calligraphy, paintings, and patterns with the sharp blade. However, manual engraving can usually only be applied to wood, bamboo, jade, stone, and other materials. Other hard and tough materials such as glass, crystal, and metals cannot be effective even with sharp blades. This is a regret for engravers. Now there is a scientific engraving method that can replace manual labor and arbitrarily carve various concave-convex and yin-yang calligraphy and patterns. The method is to apply a chemical action to the part that should be engraved to rot it away, and use a rot-resistant agent to retain the part that is not engraved. In this way, the regrets of general engravers are compensated.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to introduce the engraving methods of copper and iron to readers first, and then introduce other engraving methods when I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>Before we implement the engraving of copper and ironware, the first step is to mix the rot-resistant agent. There are usually two mixing methods for this agent: (1) Mix 16 parts of yellow wax, 1 part of asphalt, and 6 parts of tallow; (2) Mix 8 parts of beeswax, 2 parts of beef tallow, 10 parts of rosin, and 10 parts of pine root oil. These two kinds of rot-resistant agents are applicable to copper and ironware. When applying, you can put the above-mentioned materials in porcelain, melt and mix them, dip a pen in this solution, and write calligraphy and paintings on the copper and ironware, and then use a corrosive agent to rot away other parts to make the calligraphy and paintings protrude. This is a positive engraving. If you want to carve negative engravings, first coat the object to be engraved with this agent, and then use a fine knife to carve calligraphy and paintings, scrape off the rot-resistant agent from the part that should be engraved, and then let it rot away, then the calligraphy and paintings will be recessed and become negative engravings.</p>
<p>Regarding the preparation of corrosive agents, the chemical materials and methods of the corrosive agent are different due to the different properties of copper and ironware. Now, let's try to describe them separately.</p>
<p>(1) There are about two types of copper corrosive agents. 1. Dissolve 20 parts of potassium chloride in 200 parts of water, and then dissolve 20 parts of pure hydrochloric acid in 500 parts of water. Mix the above two solutions together, and then it can be applied. The chemical action of this corrosive agent is extremely weak, and the corrosion is very slow, which is suitable for fine and dense engraving. 2. Dissolve 260 parts of pure nitric acid, 64 parts of ether made from alcohol and strong sulfuric acid, and 4 parts of butyric acid in 250 parts of water. This kind of agent has a relatively strong and rapid corrosive power.</p>
<p>(2) There are about three types of iron corrosive agents. 1. Dissolve a large amount of chromic acid in a small amount of water and stir it to make it thick, and then it can be applied. 2. 10 parts of pure nitric acid, 40 parts of 30% acetic acid, and 10 parts of alcohol. The corrosive power of the above two is relatively weak. 3. 10 parts of fuming nitric acid, 30 parts of 30% pure acetic acid, and 10 parts of water. This kind of agent has a strong corrosive power and is suitable for deep and rough engraving.</p>
<p>The above are all common and simple methods. Readers can make them in their spare time. This is a very interesting kind of small craft.</p>
<p>Family Problems</p>
<h3>Wife</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang, who used to be an elementary school teacher, has recently been terribly ill. For example, she felt dizzy when she got up this morning. After a burst of severe coughing, an extremely sour taste surged up from her stomach, and then she vomited, vomited. First, it was the rice grains from the night before, and then it was the bright yellow bitter water: : : Then she felt even more dizzy, her eyes turned black, and finally she couldn't hold on and fell heavily on the bed, wiping the wet corners of her eyes with her sleeve.</p>
<p>Turning her face, she glared at her husband sleeping next to her, only to see a thick layer of yellowish color on his face. She knew this was because he was drunk every day. There was also a heavy layer of smoke stain on the corners of her eyes and forehead, obviously the result of excessive morphine stimulation. He was very tired and slept very soundly, even snoring. Originally, all of this could make her heartache, but she didn't. She knew that her love for him had long since withered away, and she felt that all she should add to him was resentment, only resentment. It was because of this extreme resentment and sorrow that she had become so thin.</p>
<p>"But can resentment alone solve the problem?" she thought: "He has been fascinated by that concubine. He has to go every day, every night. He simply can't not go. In order to excite himself, he has to smoke opium. In order to win her favor, he has to accompany her to burn alcohol. Ah! She is going to kill him. But, I am his wife. Although I have reason to take back the love I gave him, can I bear to watch him die like this? Besides, according to him, he said: 'Because of unemployment, I have no way to support my wife and two children. If it weren't for this slut to help us materially, then our family would be destroyed. : :'" Naturally, this is the husband's full reason to dedicate himself to that concubine, but what a bitter insult this is to the husband and myself! Ah! I have sold my husband, and I am as ashamed as those shameless men who are willing to let their wives prostitute themselves to live! : :"</p>
<p>So, she cried sadly.</p>
<p>At dusk, the husband got up lazily. She herself didn't know who was driving her, but she immediately prepared the water for him to wash his face and served him carefully. When she was preparing dinner in the kitchen, she secretly looked at his neatly tied tie, new clothes, and even though it was hot, he still put on a lot of snow cream: : :</p>
<p>Her mood was so dazed that she simply couldn't believe he was still her husband.</p>
<p>Sweat and tears mingled and hung on her lips.</p>
<p>When she was serving the children and her husband to eat, she accidentally met the bleak smile he gave her and immediately said:</p>
<p>"Lian'er's father! (She had been calling him this since she gave birth to her eldest daughter, Lianxiang.) Can't you go out tonight? Look at your body, it's really too late."</p>
<p>": :" The husband did not answer.</p>
<p>"Then you are completely for her: :" "I also ask you, please don't bother me anymore."</p>
<p>The electric light came on, and the husband still boldly walked out the door.</p>
<p>She couldn't bear it any longer, and a strong hatred completely seized her chest. A strange fishy smell surged into her heart, followed by a mouthful of bright red blood. The ignorant children were frightened and cried by their mother's madness, which made her feel even more disturbed. So, she grabbed the biggest one and beat them indiscriminately, even wanting to swallow them immediately. Finally, she ran out regardless of everything, although the little boys were still crying loudly.</p>
<p>At about midnight, she staggered out of a casino. She lost, she lost all her silver dollars, and she drank more alcohol, because she wanted to get some comfort in her drunkenness. Originally, she didn't want to go home, but she finally stumbled to the door. When she opened the back door and went in, it simply made her suspect that she was in a dream. Her husband and that woman were sitting together drinking beer. Immediately, his hand was frightened back from the woman's shoulder. The strong smell of smoke sprayed directly over, and the woman had a proud smile, as if saying, "I have completely occupied your husband." So, she fell heavily on the bed again, unable to move.</p>
<p>Xue Jieyu's Living Place</p>
<h3>A Registered School</h3>
<p>— Di Xiu</p>
<p>Yesterday. I went to visit a friend because I had important things to do. When I passed by a certain alley, I suddenly saw an old and dilapidated house in front of me. In front of this house, there were two signs hanging. One was a certain cotton cloth shop, and the other was originally a small school, and it was also registered with the Municipal Education Bureau. Shanghai is very expensive, and I originally understood it very well, but a school can't be so casual, let alone registered with the Education Bureau. At that time, I was impulsively curious and went to investigate the content of the school.</p>
<p>After some investigation and reconnaissance, I knew everything about the school. It turned out that the organization of the school was completely familial and commercialized. The so-called principal and teachers were mostly a family. Just like a store, although there were only five people in their family, they also had so many titles, such as dean of academics, director of moral education, accounting affairs, etc., all of which they took on or兼任. However, there were also more than 150 students. The course of a day was still six o'clock, and all the subjects were also very complete. Their school building was a total of three up and three down. One up and one down was rented to the cotton cloth shop. In fact, the school building only had two up and two down, but there were also boarders, which was really interesting.</p>
<p>As for the school's economic problems, that was also unique. The tuition fees paid by male students belonged to the boss, and the tuition fees paid by female students belonged to the boss's wife. The school's opening expenses and expenses were the responsibility of the boss, and their family's expenses were the responsibility of the boss's wife. It was also orderly.</p>
<p>Recently, the school is also coming to an end for this semester, but they are working hard to plan the recruitment of students for the next semester. The school recently announced to old students that if they can pay the tuition fees for the next semester now, then they can get a discount of one dollar and a free hat. Commercial competition is now becoming more acute and profound, and school competition is also slowly starting.</p>
<p>As for such a simple school, it can also get the favor and pleasure of the Education Bureau and be able to register. This may be due to the boss's wide social network and flexible means.</p>
<p>Behind the Scenes</p>
<h3>Such Education</h3>
<p>— Mingxun</p>
<p>I never look at advertisements in newspapers, but yesterday I accidentally picked up the XX newspaper to read. Suddenly, I found an advertisement for "Recruiting Teachers." The content of this advertisement is copied below to introduce it to readers who have not seen it before.</p>
<p>Now, a certain school has entrusted us to recruit a high-ranking position and also run a summer school. The monthly salary is 20 to 30 yuan, and food and lodging are provided, but a cash guarantee is required. Those who are willing to take the job should go to XX Tobacco Paper Store on the 2nd floor of XX Village, XX Intersection, Ganshi East Road, French Concession, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM this afternoon to contact Mr. XX.</p>
<p>Originally, there were many, many false and behind-the-scenes things such as posting advertisements in various Shanghai newspapers to recruit staff: : : requiring a deposit. But now it is even playing out this behind-the-scenes drama in the education sector, which is the foundation of the country. Haha, we Chinese must also play new tricks and become educational inventors? I have to admire him with all my heart.</p>
<p>In this Chinese society, which is full of holes and on the verge of bankruptcy, it is indeed a very difficult thing for the unemployed to find a place to eat. Even professional recruiters with flying social skills may not be able to accommodate so many talkative rice bowls. Now that there is such an opportunity, then the general unemployed will of course be eager to go there. On the Shanyin Road, there is a trend of being overwhelmed. However, looking at the above advertisement, being a teacher also requires a deposit, which inevitably makes educational talents lose their educational spirit, and makes the general teachers sigh with emotion that if you have no money, don't be a teacher.</p>
<p>There are also some things that make me suspicious, that is, if the principals of these schools really want to recruit talents, if they can openly recruit, why bother to ask someone to recruit them on their behalf, and spend more procedures? Isn't it also like military and diplomatic secrets that cannot be made public? These, these, I can't name them, I only name them mysterious, strange, dark, and strange education, but what kind of medicine is this principal selling in the gourd? I thought about it again and again, but I still couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>Similarly, from the above, alas! We can know that society is full of hypocrisy and darkness everywhere (of course, there are a few exceptions). Young men and women! We must be careful not to fall into the trap, so as to avoid making a mistake that will last forever.</p>
<p>Market News</p>
<p>The second issue of Match Monthly is published. The Match Monthly, edited by the China National Match Industry Association at No. 6 Sichuan Road, Shanghai, has been well received by the society since the publication of the first issue. The second issue has now been published continuously, and the content is richer than before. If you want to request a copy by mail, please attach two cents in postage stamps. It can still be sent.</p>
<p>The Best-selling Yangmei of Erdu, Shangyu. Yangmei is the most fresh and sweet among fruits, and the Yangmei produced in Erdu, Shangyu is the most beautiful. Now, a Jia from Shangyu has organized the Erdu Yangmei Company to purchase high-quality Erdu Yangmei to Shanghai. The general distribution office is located at the Shanghai First Station, Henan Road, Beijing Road, and the consignment office is located at Lilli Native Products Company, Tianjin Road, Zhejiang Road. It is also heard that the company has also agreed with Lilli Company to put all the Yangmei in Lilli Company's air-conditioned room, which can keep it from spoiling for a long time, that is, it can be stored until winter and sold on the market.</p>
<p>Picture Newspaper Transfer. Now, a young writer has suffered huge losses due to the impact of the Shanghai War. He is willing to transfer his collection of picture newspapers at a low price, including several thick volumes of Shen Xin Shi San Bao Picture Newspapers, which are beautifully decorated. Those who are interested, please contact Mr. Lin at Moss Yanghang, No. 261 Jiangxi Road.</p>
