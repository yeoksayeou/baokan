<h3 id="c1">敬告國貨實業家彬· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>隔昨一評。吾人已提出推廣國貨一點。爲挽救我國經濟危機之對策矣。然而我國今日。衣食都仰給於人。其他新式之産品。更不待言。民族實業。奄奄一息。即如自來爲出口大宗之茶絲。今亦日即凋敝。不可復振。民族實業而長困於衰敝與没落之境。則外貨自無法抵制。漏巵無由而塞。江河蕩蕩。日趨於下。而經濟之危機。亦終於無法挽救。故欲挽救經濟之危機。發展民族實業。又實爲最重要之一端。</p>
<p>雖然處於國際資本主義壓迫之情勢下。我國民族實業之發展。果有可能乎。不平等條約之桎梏。國外大資本之傾軋。舶來廉價品之競賣。我國微弱之民族資本。果能當其鋒鋩乎。吾人則以爲我國民族實業之發展。非無可能。特民族實業家與金融家必須有根本之覺悟必須放大其眼光。不以謀取個人之利益爲前提。而以民衆之福利爲前提。同時各部門之生産。尤必須在有計劃之狀態下進行。</p>
<p>何以言之。當前之情勢。最爲顯明。除投入外國資本家肘掖之下之買辦而外。一切之民族實業家。皆處於同一之命運。換言之。即同處於被外國資本排擠傾軋束縛桎梏之悲境。故爲本身事業計。爲民族利益計。我國之民族實業家。應親密團結於同一之民族戰線上。共謀我民族實業之發展。并挽救我經濟前途之危機。曩昔我國實業家。各以其本身利益爲前提。各以其少量之資本。從事於某一部門之生産事業。對外各自爲戰。對内更互相排擠。互相競爭。互相傾軋。其覆敗自爲事所必然。故今後亟應通力合作。和衷共濟。對外力謀利權之挽回。對内互相扶持。樹立民族實業之根基。次之。過去各部門之生産。槪爲無計劃狀態。而此種無計劃狀態。則又由於各業之相互競爭。此種競爭狀態。正有如一般人形容美國帽子工業之無計劃生産。多數資本家視帽子工業之必能獲利。遂各不相謀。同時經營多數之帽子工廠。加速生産。繼則因生産過剩。而銷路停滯。復因銷路停滯。而削價競賣。减少工資。裁退工人。工廠終於無法維持。而同歸於盡。數年之後。帽子又感缺乏。而新的競爭又應時而興。此種循環相生之悲劇不獨帽子工業爲然。舉凡各部門之生産。莫不皆然。是皆由於生産之無整個計劃也。故今後我國之實業家。宜引此爲殷鑒。宜集合。資力加强各部門生産之力量。利用外國之技術人材。就社會之需要量與消費力。以進行生産。庶幾可以杜　競爭之弊端。更可以避免生産供不應求或過剩之現象。使互相傾軋而終於同歸倒閉之悲劇。不至發生。至於興辦工業。則尤必儘先從事於大衆日用必需生産品。以及生産工具諸部門。其他奢侈品及不必要之消耗品。徒爲少數富貴階級所享受者。儘可從緩舉辦。再實業家之目光。勿徒集於通商大埠宜力向内地發展。開發内地之富源。金融家亦勿坐擁　資。徒從事於投機事業。地産買賣。宜斥其過剩之資金。予實業家以實力之掖助。必如是而後。我民族實業乃有發展之望。經濟危機乃有挽救之可能。吾人深份國内之實業家金融家通力合　努力以打破當前之難局。國内要電</p>

<p>三十</p>
<p>我們前次公議由各家輪流供飯。第一回就輪到春生哥的頭上。他今天是辛苦了，一到鄕下就忙着去預備飯菜。我的嘴福倒不淺，春生哥硬要拉我去做陪客。</p>
<p>當我們動身之前，朱先生把小弟弟呌到一邊，招呼他說··［你平常是吃肉不吃皮。今天在農人家裏去做客，可要守些規矩，連皮一起吃。農人拿他血汗換來的錢請我們吃飯是很不容易的。若是嫌精揀肥，把可吃的東西白白的糟掉,那就是辜負他們的好意了。］小弟弟點點頭。</p>
<p>我們到了春生哥的家裏，只見宋老太，李司務，趙小二哥，丁老五都在那兒了，連主人恰恰坐滿一張八仙棹。春生嫂嫂是在廚房裏親手弄飯做菜。他們的兩個可愛的孩子，梅香和櫻兒是忙着冲茶，上菜，添飯，打手巾把子。今晚所上的菜是四碗四盤。盤菜是干絲，醃菜，鴨蛋，香腸：碗菜是青菜豆付湯，醃鯉魚，清燉鷄，紅燒肉。這種菜在我們鄕下是要隔幾個月才吃得着一次。今晚的菜是特别弄得結實而豐富，用村莊裏頂大的盤子和頂大的碗子端出來。朱先生是有先見之明。那紅燒肉的皮是有牛皮那樣厚，而且是一根一根的黑毛，怒髮衝冠的竪着。我留心看小弟弟怎樣去對付。我猜想他是歡喜吃紅燒肉。如果在自己家裏他必是老實不客氣用筷子看準一塊取來，把肉與皮交界處放在門牙間一咬隨將帶毛之皮放在棹上，再從容去細嚼那美味的肉。他今晚一定不能這様痛快的幹。他要就不吃，要就連皮帶毛一口吞。他是在考慮。畢竟他是下了决心，取得一塊，眼睛夾一夾送進嘴去。</p>
<p>我們先商量什麽日子開學。</p>
<p>鄕下破蒙學生總要過了二月二纔能進館，已經破過蒙的可以早些。但無論如何總得揀個好日子。自然，那官曆是我們的惟一的指導書。春生哥拿了一本官曆來請朱先生揀。朱先生揀定了陽曆三月十五日即陰曆二月初九日趙小二哥說：［給我看看。］李司務說：［你認不得字，字也認不得你，你怎麽看得出日子好壞。］小二哥說：［香瓜看官曆，一行到底是好日。朱先生揀的這個日子好極了。］</p>

<p>海倫麥迪遜女士成功史（三）槐靑</p>
<p>▲努力和成功</p>
<p>一九二八年海倫女士造成世界新紀錄的處女作、雖然没有正式承認、但已表演她游泳的驚人技術了、他首交次成名的一年、是在練習期中、她非正式的造成世界百米新紀錄、也就是百米游泳首次把海倫麥迪遜的芳名、傳遍了世界各國報紙的體育消息欄、</p>
<p>海倫和她的敎練、彼此都很尊敬、杜德先生很留心指導她的技術、海倫女士也很信仰很虛心地接受杜德先生的指導、</p>
<p>杜德先生很謙恭地說［海倫女士的成功、並不是我指導的力量、她是天賦生就的特殊游泳家、我任十八年游泳指導、從没有如海倫女士這樣尊敬和注意她自己的技能、］</p>
<p>［幾年之前、當她還是小孩子的時候、她已有充分的能力、造成她的游泳、她很專心地研究游泳、努力於她的造就、］</p>
<p>他預想要打破一種紀錄之前、必規定一種練習方法、譬如說一千碼游泳、她先打聽這游泳池是多長、要轉幾次身、這個問題解决後、計算從第一次轉身到最後一次往返、應用多少速率、海倫女士對於這一點、極有研究、她的時間和速度　支配得非度得當、她要想打破這種紀錄時、在三四星期前、就下决心去研究和練習、</p>
<p>▲起居飲食</p>
<p>游泳對於食物、很有關係、消化不良、就要影響技術、海倫女士對於吃東西和訓練的時間、都很講究、她以爲下而的幾點、是游泳者必須注意的　　（一）隨自己的食慾、吃有益於身體的食物、要吃多少就吃多少、但不可過量、</p>
<p>（二）規定訓練時間、</p>
<p>（三）游泳時動作須自然、須有韻律似的不可慌急、</p>
<p>（四）注意休息、不可過勞、</p>
<p>海倫說、［我練習游泳、規定每次一小時、每星期練習三次、如有比賽、則停止練習、如身體發胖、則多做他種工作設法使其恢復原狀、］</p>
<p>她每晚八點鐘或九點鐘就睡、早晨亦很早就起來、早餐須擇富於物質滋養料的如鷄蛋·水菓·牛肉·和榖類等、如下午有正式比賽時、上午停止運動、早餐後稍作經微的活動、以增進體力、中餐則吃牛肉和堅實的榖類、餐畢完全休息、如在夜間比賽、則在下午四點半鐘就進餐、所吃的是牛肉·蔬菜·餅干·蛋糕等物、當比賽之前、完全不進飲食、</p>
<p>▲快要十九歲了</p>
<p>我們知道了海倫女士的成功、的確不是平凡的女子或男子可比、是運動員的好模範、他現在身體五呎十吋、體重一百五十三磅、這是游泳所賜給她的健康美麗的體格、她到今年六月十九日是十九歲、</p>
<p>游泳界的海倫麥迪遜女士和網球界的海倫惠爾斯女士（馬迪夫人）同是世界上的兩位天使、她倆偉大的成功、驚起了全世界的仕女、總統夫人的榮譽、也及不得她倆、</p>
<p>麥迪遜女士於一九三一年六月畢業於西雅圖林肯高級學校、她對於各種運動、都很有興趣、如籃球、賽跑、網球等、不過游泳是她特殊的技能、也是她特殊的嗜好、她的學問也很精、她做的小說和美術、曾博得西雅圖批評家的讚美、</p>
<p>▲否認已經訂婚</p>
<p>海倫女士的婚姻很引起一般人的注意、但是她極力否認、她說［去年冬季紐約幾家報紙上、競載我和紐約某君訂婚的消息、但是我自己還不知道我的未婚夫是那一位、所以我要特别聲明、我還没有訂婚、］</p>
<p>華盛頓大學、就在海倫女士的家鄉但是她没有進大學、她的將來、是在參加今年世界運動會後、要找一種職業、因爲她家裏並不富裕、而且她的父母因只生她一個寶貝的女兒、她要帮助她的父母、或者要加入職業游泳界、現在有很多人去慫恿她、或是擔任游泳指導、或是職業游泳家、（完）</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>自一二八滬變後。不特都市繁榮受其影響。即農村生活亦頗有關係。上海縣所屬各鄕村。農婦耕種之暇。依舊紡織土布。以維家用。近因銀根奇緊。四鄕布莊週轉不靈。乏錢下鄕收買。致農婦所織之布。無人顧問。幾有坐以待斃之象。上海縣農民敎育館館長張翼有鑒於此。乃發起土布展覽會。以資提倡。定期二十天。巡迴各處。本月十三日起。在南市蓬萊市塲公開展覽三天。籌成於最後一日。曾往參觀。所有布匹。不下百餘種。花様以柳條·方格·蘆蓆紋·骰子塊等居多數。質雖粗。甚經用。該會爲集思廣益。以備改良起見。備有意見箱一。凡往參觀之民衆。如有意見。皆可直陳而投入此箱。每至　地。將該地參觀人之意見。整理後。作爲參考資料。開會討論後。以便採用而改良。是日所見之意見。大致均以土布門面太狹。裁製新式衣服時。衣縫太多·又花色不多。不若洋布之容易觸目。質厚耐用。宜於冬季。而不宜於夏季。主加寬門面。染色不變。改用細紗等。據該會主辦人謂此種意見書。甚有價値。擬次第採納以告農民。上海縣敎育局局長施舍。報告此會動機時。語甚發笑。謂上海之租界。鄕人稱之曰洋場。住於洋塲之人。往往以住洋房穿洋裝說洋話看洋書爲時髦。對於鄕下人所織之士布。目爲土頭土腦。係土老兒與阿土生所用。不屑一顧不知購用洋貨。以洋錢流至外洋。使洋人製造槍砲以侵略我華。在洋人心目中。認爲洋盤。殊不値得。望以後愛用洋貨之同胞。改變心理。而購土貨。切弗以爲佔染洋氣而洋洋得意云云。衆皆捧腹。上海縣抗日救國委員會主席姜彦秋。以洋布爲摩登女。土布比鄕下姑娘。謂摩登女雖好看。恐有毒。娶後終身受累。鄕下姑娘。諺曰有吃無看相。甚合實用。衆皆歎其比喩確切而鼓掌。</p>

<p>— 錢台生</p>
<p>六月六日在本報發表的統計上，有關子自殺和離婚的統計，我們且看：自殺的一共有五十七起，最多的是［家庭事故］佔十七，經濟壓迫的佔次之，十四，餘外墜落，失業，口角共佔廿六，我們相信，件事故的發生，必有　主要的原因，要以［社會學］說，是很値得研究的事情。我們决不能看了人［死］，便說　　她　是碰了鬼，我們應該相信，在那　種社會組織之下，那　種是必然的現象？這决不是一句話可以包括得完的事，所謂［家庭事故］又是什麽［事故］呢？這統計表上自然没有告訴我們，但是我們可以想像得到正有這樣十七個人，在用着他們種種方法去找［死］，决也不是偶然或者神經錯亂的事，那是我們的，我們的社會，應該負極大的責任的，至於爲［經濟壓迫］而在找死，那以現在的經濟組織說，是並不爲怪的，你看，那一國丨除了蘇俄丨不是有許多人在挨着飢餓，在等着一死］，在這個年頭，不挨餓不找死，那是太夢想了吧。</p>
<p>至於離婚，一共有四十三起，而［意見不合］的，却佔了三十四，餘共佔六。我們在這［意見不合］的原因上，自然不得不懷疑的，你以爲女人披散了頭髮要鬧的，便單單是［意見］兩個字麽？他們，我相信一定把一切難解决的糾紛都埋葬了，把它放上意見不合四個字，那祗是表明他們解决離婚上　個最簡捷而堂皇的托辭吧。</p>
<p>自然，我們回過來說，一般人如是在結婚的時候，能不以自己血氣的衝動，而要暫時去解决某種滿足種下的種子，在當你們一切［暴露］的時候，不去找律師，還有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>然而，病態總是病態的社會，綁案，暗殺，盜案，天天不是在我們人間活動？你又要怎樣說呢？根本社會要造成的，便是這樣　個社會，你便不相信？</p>

<p>— 特</p>
<p>某天我（倫敦觀察報記員）在莫斯科參觀　個名呌［共産黨國際］的幼稚園。　是屬於被服廠的勞工的。園内約有六十個兒童。年齡在三歲至七歲之間。經費入半由廠中擔任。父母祇供給兒童的食費。他們每日吃的。是麵包·蔬菜·牛奶。還加上些奶油和糖。有時吃點蘋果。每隔兩三天。吃一回肉。園内的設備。在莫斯科城内可算是數一數二的了其中許多特點。很和别國的幼稚園相同。兒音按年齡分成數組。每天游戲·讀書·休息·都按著很有秩序的課程表實行。他們彫刻和剪紙粘成圖畫。用小木塊造屋。並照料花草。年齡稍大的兒童。要管理進膳等事。［共産黨國際］所注意的三件大事。是虔信列寗主義。積極反宗敎宣傳。注重軍事玩具和游戲。有一間室中。高懸一塊木版。是兒童自己製成的。上面寫著［我們怎麽履行列寗的信條］幾個大字的標題。他們履行信條的方法。各各不同。有的儲金捐助摩泊爾。（這是救濟别國監禁的共産黨一個機關）有的儲金製造飛機。有的將玩具送給一個［集團］。有一個得意洋洋的小兒童。自詡曾反他家中的偶像移去。有一張粗草的圖畫。畫著移去偶像的景狀。下面有一行字道。［没有上帝。我們不要耶穌。我們要使父母也不信上帝。］我呌站在身旁一個七歲的兒童說明畫意。他便沉著臉說道。［上帝是没有的。所以我們把偶像移去。只有敎士和資本家說有上帝。因爲他們是勞工的蠶敵。想奴隸勞工。］這時又來了兩個兒童說道。［自然没有上帝。外國工人的兒童。不許進學校。因爲怕他們知道没有上帝。］我便問道。［外國的兒童有進學校的麽。］這一句問話。把他們或住。内中有一個兒童回答道。［有進校的。有不進的。］又有一個回答道。［富人的兒童是去的］我又看見牆上懸著軍事委員伏羅　洛夫和蒲登尼將軍的肖像。還有許多海陸軍打仗的圖畫。稍高的一組。都是六七歲的兒童。他們的玩具。全是雛形的戰品。案上放著小坦克車·小砲·小來復槍·小機關槍·小鐵甲火車。地板上還有許多木砲。都是兒童自己製的。有幾個兒童拿著小來復槍。繞室跑著。作彼此開槍之狀。我便問一们女敎員。爲什麽使兒童這樣注意軍用品。伊回答道。［我們不是和平運動家。我們平日把赤軍的内容。細細告訴兒童。敎他們敬愛軍人。他們長大了。都願意當兵。我們常常帶了兒童去參觀赤軍學校和營房。兵士也常常到我們這裏和兒童們游戲。我們知道將來定受資本主義的國家攻擊。所以常常準備戰事。這才能履行列寗的信條啊。］伊說這話時。還朝著牆上的信條版。作一種表情的姿勢。我參觀了後。腦海中留下極深刻的印象尤其是對於在兒童最初時代。便著著實實的灌輸軍事觀念。</p>
<p>讀者無不交口稱譽。蓋自涵秋作古。文壇久已寂默。得此文情並茂之作。自能遐邇傳誦。殆全書殺青。三友書社首與恨水接洽。購得版權。發行單行本。銷數之佳。特出紀錄。偶聞三友經理李君告愚。一再復版。現已五版出書。行銷字内。總數在一萬五千以上。可謂自有社會小說以來未有之盛况。</p>

<p>安參議不知道。以爲我在衙門裏當早辦妥了。昨天去過一趙。看看情形不對。才曉得我是忘記了没曾送。這只怪我疏忽。實不是壓根兒不懂事那就多送一點補足這份情吧。本來我想歸裏包堆凑四百元。也就像様兒了。你去不妨和萬處長呌開了說。安參議現在并還没得著好的差事。對不起只好這様應個景兒。將來若承大夥兒捧塲。另有好的出息。當然忘不了他們。我和安參議都不是肯虧負朋友的人啊。毛德順道。得啦。這様還有什麽不成的。我去去就來。您二位聽我的信吧。及毛順去了之後。不滿兩　鐘頭。仍坐著他們所代備的汽車回來。興冲冲向他夫婦說道。全說好了。萬金生受了這筆錢。還非常客氣。說昨天的事情。是不知者不爲罪。若早曉得是您二位。就是不談這個也决不能是那様的。現在大帥正待會客。萬處長也很想和安參議見見。不如我這就陪安參議去一趙罷。　笑雲謝過了毛德順往返奔走了勞。當即催促安玉田就與毛德順同去。臨出門上車。又再諄囑安玉田於今天見著老葉時。務必就把那早預備好的招撫軍隊的條陳呈上。并當面要求他即行批委。五太太那裏。也早替你加工催促過。十停有八九停能發生神效的。安玉田一一記好。匆匆與毛德順又去到那承啓龍潭虎穴一般的地方。但這一次舊地重臨。雖僅僅只相隔半天一夜之久。一切情形却大爲兩様。毛德順權充著臨時護術。保著安玉田大搖大擺的逕奔客廳裏内間的處長室。代爲掀起門帘。讓安玉田先踏進去。他跟在後面還擔任通報。大喊著萬處長。安參議來啦。安玉田進門抬頭一看。見那處長室倒也樸實無華。兩邊横七竪八擺開幾張木板床。墻上亂掛了一些手槍軍帽皮靴和武裝帶。當中有一張方桌。桌上面放著一把大茶壺。一副烏木骨牌。幾本大號簿。又還有無數的大小不同顔色不一各式各樣的名片。撒開得到處皆是。竟與平常大公館裏門房中的情景。也　不了多少。</p>

<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份又見不振之象、以洋來報價、又跌去四五六角不等、所以人心異常萎靡、氣象不佳、雖大廠方面勢成騎虎、不能再抛、惟小廠及内地廠家、稍有出檔、故開價步小、迨至下午開盤、初尙見穩、後因抛户見盛、各月份又復步落、蓋趨此實銷清淡、國外空氣、又不甚佳、或者洋麥之續來、又須成爲事實、所以自然低落、非一時所可振奮也、結果七月份至十月份各跌二分、十一月份跌二分七厘半云、</p>
<h3 id="c134">標麥不振之主因 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>（一）海外報跌（二）粉銷沉寂（三）出新時期　　昨日期麥市面、各月份大致呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價又跌四五六角不等、似乎國外之過剩、依然不改、而國内之粉銷、亦依然沉寂、正値新麥時期、遇此檔口、市價之難俏、亦爲不可避免之事、不過近期如七月份、本地行家仍有收意、一小即收、一時難以過小、遠期則洋麥關係、人心　不見佳也、結果七八九月份各小三分、十月份小四分、十一月份小三分、新麥交易仍不暢、開八五折安定麥二兩七錢、方泰麥二兩六錢、共七百包云、</p>

<p>海口枝今庚收成豐盛、與去年之歉收、正成反比例、昨據電訊、首批新貨已到香港、惟爲數有限、大約不再轉申、正批貨據函訊、預計廿號外可即抵此、首盤貨主、極望開價正確、務使切勿過低、以阻來源也、</p>

<p>本埠洋莊絲市、忽呈活動、里昂等處滬白廠經電報、連日均有轉滬、市盤雖已漲起五六十兩、奈廠方成本、仍須虧折二三百兩、是以成交一時難暢達、昨日達昌愼餘開利百利等續有Ｂ字級十三至十五條份滬白廠經八十五包、成交價扯五百四十五兩、較前日又漲十兩左右、美莊乾利藍樂璧等亦有現期貨談判、而均匀（即伊文奈司）須八十一二分、來價不滿五百兩、廠方態度堅挺、成交有待、由乾經等亦均有看漲之趨勢云絲茶</p>

<p>屯溪珍眉綠茶、自上星期一度慘跌後、市面已呈悲觀景象、乃日來各洋行深恐茶價續跌、依然觀望不買、以致人心極度恐慌、市面一蹶不振、日昨恰和錦隆等行、對於屯溪珍眉、又復做開數百箱、市價已跌至九十兩、因此各路珍眉針眉等綠茶、一致趨落、情勢非常惡劣、據一般消秘靈通者稱、非一致堅定、無以挽回頽勢、蓋現下摩洛哥市塲、綠茶存底僅祇三四千箱、至爲枯薄、而該處豆麥各項收成、均告豐收、將來銷胃、並不薄弱、邇來市面呆滯、實係滬市跌價太速所致云、</p>

<p>（廿一年五月通運生絲貿易公司報告）</p>
<p>五月份絲市、因受趨小影響、致重行下跌甚烈、絲價又發現最低新紀錄、茲列表如左、</p>
<p>紐約生絲　横濱生絲</p>
<p>交易所　Ｓayu現絲　交易所</p>
<p>第一月期　第一月期</p>
<p>絲　　絲</p>
<p>五月二日　一·三三　五二○　五五·一○</p>
<p>五月九日　一·三○　四九○　四五·○○</p>
<p>五月十七日一·二二　四六○　四二·七○</p>
<p>五月廿三日一·二○　四七○　四二·四○</p>
<p>五月三十日一·一一　四二○　三五·五○</p>
<p>自四月末週乾利向日政府買進現絲十萬八千担後、絲業界咸以爲如此大批現貨、旣已由政府掌握轉入私人之手、自當發生强有力之反動、而絲市或有穩固上漲之可能、乃事實竟不然、美國生絲公會於五月初週、公佈美國絲織廠四月份用絲祗三五·七九九擔、（一九三二的三月份四六·七六一担、一九三一年四月份四一·三五六担、）絲市因之重行開始下跌、日本出口絲商復在紐約狂抛新絲售價極低（例如三井抛售二十·二十二條紋八十五分匀度新絲價美金一元二角（照美滙三十一元五角計算合銀四百六十兩、）又二十·二十二條紋八十三分匀度價美金一元一角（照美滙三十一元五角計算合銀四百十五兩）致跌風加厲加以每年此時新絲期近、市面常呈衰痕、因此絕無上漲可能、</p>
<p>經濟衰落、各業凋敝亦爲絲市低降之另一原因、即以美國而論非、特不見進境、乃竟日形衰疲、處此全世界不景氣之時、美國政府已難維持其財政預算、而議院中猶在繼續進行各種新計劃、爭論各項新議案擴大與緊縮兩派鬭爭、至今未决、此種現象、徒使國内國外增加不穩與混亂趨勢、结果工商業兢兢從事、祗得縮小其營業範園至最低限度、亦自然之理耳、至美國絲業現狀、則絲織業較爲有利、存貨旣將告罄、廠方或將再行增加生産亦意中事、襪業方面、因銷路疲滯、獲利亦少、但天然絲因低廉之故、已與人造絲發生劇烈競爭、如用於織製廉價衣料或襯衫等幾可　人造絲而代之矣、因此人造絲業大受影響、聞有數廠將於六月内暫行停閉一部份工作、一俟天然絲價格稍高、競爭可免、再行開廠</p>
<p>五月份里昂交易旣清價格又小有則亦盡爲投機者所操縱、此種抛空份子投機之程度、可於下例明之、此間買户欲購廠房牌十三·二十二廠絲、出價七五○兩而廠方猶不肯脫手、但在里昂已有人願以一百法郎出售、（合銀六五○兩）（投機者市面看跌、故先行抛出、俟其跌進售價、再行補進、）</p>
<p>五月杪三跳舞恒金（ＨＹ）月兎牌等絲可售九五至九七法郎、但至月底此等絲祗能售八○至八二法郎、通運曾有電報月兎或三跳無等級絲、來價低至七一法郎（合銀四八○兩、）</p>
<p>歐洲對於加增銷絲希望仍頗渺茫、一則因歐洲政局未許樂觀、尤有進者、最近德國國家社會黨已漸趨得勢、前途恐更多政治糾紛、再者Danube各國實際上已瀕破産、其經濟上之危機、亦亟待解决、英國政府最近對於現行絲織品進口稅之外、另加百分之二十、致惹起里昂與瑞士沮利克Zurich市塲上極大恐慌、蓋該兩處出口品、全恃運銷英國如照生絲大市而論、則運銷英國出口品低落、因而减少出口、而另一方面則英國生産定必加增、英國今年起生絲銷費因金镑跌價、稍有起色、</p>
<p>今已列舉所有目前驅使絲價下降之重要原因如上、但自另一方面觀之、目前情况、並不如一般人意想之黯淡、何者、蓋現下經濟恐慌、各種原料出品亦莫不跌價、不過生絲較甚耳、但各處生絲存貨連日本政府預備出口之存絲在内、即以目前最低之銷耗量計算、亦不敷四閱月之用、雖數月内新絲即將應市、因其産量較去年大爲减少、絲市自不致因之下降、反之國内銷絲量非惟不致再有减少之虞、且因秋季將至大有開始增加之望、吾儕可於來季樂觀生絲供給與需要之和協焉、</p>
<p>絲價日跌、使育蠶者無利可圖、以是去年繭量大减、今年恐更將短少矣、</p>
<p>法國育蠶業、去年雖由政府津貼、但若以全國所有出産繭量計算、已减少百分之六十、意大利所産繭量、去年約减少百分之三十今年政府極力勸導、民衆咸以爲愛祖國多育蠶桑、但結果産量恐難免更將减低、數處農民甚至將桑樹截去、日本今年春繭較去年所育蠶穩約少百分之八、桑樹因肥料昂貴、農民窮困、以是桑葉欠佳、即使天時無特别變動而新繭之産量與品質、决不能十分優良也今年江蘇與浙江春繭業已開秤品質甚劣、産量較去年約少百分之五十至六十、吾人務須切記於懷、此經濟危機、無論其最初原因何屬、與其謂係信用上破産、寗可謂缺乏自信能力所致、無論何種物品無論其在統計地位上如何優强、除世界經濟與政治情形改變至信用完全恢服之時外、該貨品决難由目前衰落之情况、完全復舊也附生絲解往美廠之數量如下、</p>
<p>今年　去年　三月　四六七六一　五五三八三</p>
<p>一月　五八七九三　五五九一○　四月　三五一九九　四一三五六</p>
<p>二月　四五九○九　五四二四二　五月　四五○七三</p>
<p>茲再將美國存絲附錄如左、</p>
<p>今年　去年　三月底　六二六七五　四七四○七</p>
<p>一月底　六二九○五　五一八一四　四月底　五七六四九　三五四　七</p>
<p>二月底　七○五七○　四五三九九　五月底　三二六八八</p>
<p>絲業大略、旣如上述、近月實業部會同江浙省政府、徇絲商請求、决定豁免生絲出口各稅、并先發行庫券二百二十萬兩、俾出口陳絲、得每担一百兩之補助、另組織整理及推銷兩委員會、以總其成、在政府救濟絲業、固已盡力　無如絲價步跌、而廠方與銀錢業糾紛、又不克立時解决、國内綢廠、雖購絲不多、出價尙優、然外銷仍覺困難、月抄除法莊少數交易外、美莊竟無發展、故解决國内存絲問題、希冀廠方與銀錢業得早諒解、世界大勢、稍有轉機、絲價當即起色耳、</p>

<p>▲亨生昨晨畏罪自裁</p>
<p>▲海姆地下亦可瞑目</p>
<p>前日（十七日）上午十一時許、滬西林肯路華倫路附近、發生之西人同類相殘暗殺案、已詳誌昨日本報、惟案發之後、未幾即經捕房將死者及兇手之姓籍職業、完全偵查明白、死者屍身、於昨晨由美按察使署派員檢騐、一面由美領署及捕房嚴輯兇手、詎兇手自知難逃法網、竟於昨晨在法租界辣斐德路四百七十一號俄人所設公寓内畏罪開槍自殺、茲將詳情分述於后、</p>
<p>▲死者爲獨養子當慘案發時、其惟一目擊證人、祗有合衆汽車公司汽車夫甬人趙志良一人在塲、故自趙報告捕房後、即經捕頭派員率同趙志良將屍尋獲、迨後偵查結果、始悉死者名海姆Ｒ·Ｋ·Ｈeim、兇手名亨生Ｔ·Ｍ·hansen、兩人均美國籍、死者年僅二十三歲、爲獨養子、父母俱存、。現居美國、渠於十八個月前來華、初在天津美孚煤油公司任職、去冬來滬、嗣入普益銀公司、甫於本星期初辭職、向寓靜安寺路西人青年會、</p>
<p>▲兇手返美過滬兇手亨生、係一九二七年來華、在美海軍任三等藥劑員、翌一年、改入美豐銀行、旋即調往天津該行服務、此次因須回美道經上海、抵滬甫數日、住四馬路都城飯店、原定昨晨乘茄斐德總統輪返美、不知如何、竟發生暗殺海姆慘案、</p>

<p>▲車夫目擊經過據車夫證稱、昨晨十一時四十分、渠載兩西人出發、其中一人、識爲老主顧、迨車抵租界之西、循林肯路南行、忽聞一爆發聲、此時渠方開車、死者即坐其左旁、另一西人則依靠汽油箱上、面對海姆及渠、其左手握住汽油箱、右手藏在雨衣中、當發生爆聲前、該西人曾呼渠與海姆仰視梵王渡方面某物、迨發生爆聲、渠回顧、則海姆已倒於座上、前此兩西人談話、似頗友好、一若毫無芥蒂者、渠亦未見手槍、迨事後另一西人即命渠停車、囑助移海姆屍身至車後、謂彼患病、當送往醫院、移屍之後、渠仍返原座開車、但偶回顧、則見該西人立在車中、屍身已不見、迨駛至華倫路橋附近、該西人乃下車而去、渠遂駛回報告車行、轉報捕房云云、</p>
<p>▲兇手賃居公寓兇手亨手、將海姆暗殺逃逸後、明知捕房及美領署必定偵騎四出、渠旣美人、自知難逃法網、遂亦萌自殺之念、亨於前日下午三時許、一人至法租界辣斐德路四百七十一號俄人所設之公寓内、賃定二樓東首一室、言定每月租金四十元、入室後、即面呈倦態、命侍者取冷水一盃後、旋閉門而臥、嗣後即未有再見之者、</p>
<p>▲畏罪開槍自裁昨晨八時許、亨之臥室内、忽發生微弱之呻吟聲、隔室寓客、情知有異、即告侍者、侍者叩門不應、乃由門頂窗隙入窺、祇見亨已倒臥床上、左腕際脈管已割斷、血流滿榻、侍者駭極、報告主者、轉報法捕房、再迨探捕趕到時、亨早已自向額際開槍自殺矣、嗣又在其房内查出毒藥一瓶、大約亦係渠用以自殺之具、</p>
<p>▲美領派員認屍法捕房初尙不能斷定其自殺原因、嗣經調查結果、方悉渠即暗殺海姆案之兇手、畏罪自殺、當即通知公共租界捕房轉報美領署、立即派員趕往認明無訛、屍身候明日檢騐、</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨日我見某富商騙婚女畫家一段新聞，髪妻提起離婚之訴，新娘大鬧一塲，獨自歸寗，這件事倒是弄得［駝子跌倒兩頭不着實，］反而演成一幕家庭悲劇，</p>
<p>本來上海地方，這種慘案，天天有得發生，眞是司空見慣，這原是僅舉一個例子，重婚之罪，法律本有明文規定，但住居上海的人，往往爲環境所誘惑，或則厭故喜新，或則飽暖思淫慾，因此常見到此種焚琴煑鶴的慘案，法律雖是如此，但亦無絕對的保障，只要你兩個條件通得過，</p>
<p>一有特殊地位的，使法律可以失其效能，</p>
<p>一有絕大金錢勢力的，亦一定有辦法可以解决，</p>
<p>倘没有以上兩種潛勢力，非特你的家庭弄得不成樣子，還應受刑事上的處分呢，</p>

<p>— 荻雷</p>
<p>草帽是夏令必需的東西，通常社會上的任何階級，都是人各一頂，但是我們帶草帽的經騐，差不多每季到不用的時候，就是收藏得很好，明年夏季便不能不另換新的了，因爲本來白色的麥桿，幾個月以後，變成了很難看的黄色，或是黯淡而無光彩，市上登著刷新草帽的廣告的很多，經濟的朋友，似乎棄之可惜，便化了幾角錢去請他一洗，其實草帽的變色，可以認爲一種還原作用，當初麥桿本是黄色的，製造廠裏做成草帽以後，生生地反牠漂白了，自然經過若干時日，便恢復了本來面目，鄙人雖未開過草帽的洗刷店，經騐所得，敢貢獻一種有效而易辦的方法，倘然閱者有興，不妨照法一試，</p>

<p>手續先把草帽在清水中洗過，除去久積的灰塵，和縫内的汚垢，趁草帽未曾全乾的時候，用毛刷蘸高錳酸鉀的溶液，均塗一次，草帽上便染著一層深紫的顔色，塗好以後，放在日光内曝矖約三分鐘，隨用另一毛刷蘸草酸的溶液，塗在紫色的帽上，隨塗隨刷，那紫色的高錳酸鉀，便和草酸作用，放出養氣而漂白草帽了，用清水洗過，再刷上硫硫酸鈉的溶液，便能潔白如新，乾後即可戴用了，</p>
<p>原理草酸同高錳酸鉀作用，便放出氧，使黄色的麥桿氧化而無色，洗滌以後，墜上硫硫酸鈉，便可除去殘餘的酸性，（草酸的溶液是酸性的，不能附著帽上）這様很簡單的方法，可以在一刻鐘内完畢，而藥品祗費少許，較之另換新的，固不可同日而語，便是請刷帽店去洗滌亦似較經濟，且非常可靠，</p>
<p>注意草帽刷後，曬的時候容易發生凹凸不平，祇需在未乾之前，壓上鎭物，便能平整，如用西裝書籍數册最佳，</p>

<p>— 清夏</p>
<p>昨天我到摯友王君家裏，見他的隔鄰，住了一對摩登夫婦，那男的穿着一身西裝，神氣活現，開口愛皮西地，哈羅，也司，大有洋洋乎盈耳哉之槪，</p>
<p>據王君述及，這位仁兄，洋氣十足，嘗有二事說起來倒怪有趣的呢，</p>
<p>這位仁兄，有一個妹妹，已有十餘歲了，一天他偕她同乘公共汽車到某處去，賣票跑來向他售票，他祇買了一張票，賣票就問他的妹妹爲什麽不買呢，他連連說Small，他的意思，女孩可以免票，恰巧那位賣票，不懂英語，就正色道，我們不關四馬路五馬路，你票總要買啊，引得旁邊的人聽了，都哈哈大笑起來，結查只好照買了事，</p>
<p>又一次，他的夫人出外未回，他覺得很寂寞，便决定去看影戲解悶，臨走的當兒，他叮囑他的娘姨道，倘若少奶奶來了，問起我來，你回說Cinema就是了，誰知他的娘姨不懂就裏，還以爲他和他的夫人反目了，過後背地對人嘆惜着說，唉！現在的先生們，眞是粗野極了，想不到穿洋裝的我們的主人，竟會說出［肏奈媽］來，原來她把Cinema誤會了，</p>
<p>生意面孔</p>
<h3 id="c191">幾種特殊面 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 孔一萍</p>
<p>郵政局職員好像都是一個師傅傳授的，九點鐘前拿了快信或掛號信到郵局去，老爺們都談笑自若，儘你們在銅框外面候他們裁判，九點敲後，纔慢慢的預備工作用具，把一疊信續件發給收條，有時信件特别多，一過十二點鐘，不管你的信怎樣重要，勞駕你下午再來，恐怕慢信時已送上車站。</p>
<p>鄕下老婦提了包裹，誤踏進頭等電車，賣票的惡狠狠喊［後面去，後面去］，鄕婦因爲已在頭三等的交界，［先生謝謝你，開一開］好要求賣票的開中間的門，賣票很不願意的開門讓她過去，［碰］的把門關上時，駡了一聲猪玀。</p>
<p>［先生，對不住］顯然給資不符票據，他已換了一副笑臉向人了。</p>
<p>綢緞舖，洋貨店的夥計，也是道地的橡皮面皮，如其你是鄕下土老兒，别這様那樣和他們纏擾不清，老閶僱佣他們是預備應付女主顧的。</p>
<p>朋友來電話，他的廠裏需添簿記員，你明天九時前到寫字間見大班面試，次日我興怱怱到他辦事處，大班還没有來，九點半後，纔送進先見高肚子所謂大班，朋友去告訴他，說公事忙，在外邊等一等。</p>
<p>十一點半被傳進大班間，［面試］只問了下列簡單的問句。</p>
<p>［你是那校畢業的？］</p>
<p>［畢業後做過事嗎？］</p>
<p>［對於簿記有無經騐？］</p>
<p>［明天起到廠視事！］並簽了一張進廠的派司給我（寫字間在××路廠址在浦東）</p>
<p>在兩點鐘之内，竟没有三分鐘的空隙問上面的幾句話，看他問話時的一付魯易史東表演面孔，大槪大班的架子吧！</p>

<p>— 魯</p>
<p>囡囡剛從學校裏回來，書包也没有放下便和母親正經的說。。</p>
<p>［姆媽？學堂裏又要報名費。］</p>
<p>［啥？］母親說：［又是報名費？］隨後她向着我說：</p>
<p>［Ｌ先生！儂想格眞奇怪勿？伊拉學堂每一學期要一次報名費格。］</p>
<p>於是我從囡囡手裏接過一張紙條，只見上面用鉛字印着；</p>
<p>［本學期結束在即，學生×××如下學期仍繼續在本校肄業，務望</p>
<p>貴家長從速照章繳納報名費五元，以便登記。特此通知。校長×××謹啓　　附註；本通知單不作銀錢收據之用，報名費繳納時，本校會計處另給收條爲憑。］</p>
<p>當時我簡直給怔住了。。我眞不懂？這個學校到底是幹什麽的呢？其後囡囡又說；</p>
<p>［妮散學的辰光，先生每一個人齊把仔一張底個末事。伊講頂遲過五日天。大家齊要帶去。］</p>
<p>［好嚴格的校章，］我想··［五天内一定要繳去。］於是囡囡的母親双憤慨的操着北京話和我說：</p>
<p>［這個校長眞是聰明，譬如你繳了這五元錢，於是這一個學生便是他的，拿得穩你一定還要去交學費。即使萬一不再去了，那末他至少也得這五塊大洋。其後我接着說；</p>
<p>［哼丨一個人五元，十個人便五十·一百人便五百！呀！眞是大進賬哩！］</p>
<p>［可不是嗎？］母親又說··［又是報名費，簡直要發財哩！］</p>

<h3 id="e1">Respectful Announcement to National Goods Industrialists <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Following yesterday's commentary, we have proposed the promotion of national goods as a countermeasure to salvage our nation's economic crisis. However, our country today relies on others for clothing and food, not to mention other modern products. The national industry is on its last breath. Even tea and silk, which have traditionally been major exports, are now declining daily and cannot be revitalized. If the national industry remains trapped in a state of decline and demise, foreign goods will be impossible to resist, and the leak will be impossible to stop. Like a rushing river, the situation will only worsen, and the economic crisis will ultimately be impossible to save. Therefore, to salvage the economic crisis, developing the national industry is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>However, under the pressure of international capitalism, is the development of our national industry possible? With the shackles of unequal treaties, the squeeze of foreign capital, and the competition of cheap imported goods, can our weak national capital withstand their onslaught? We believe that the development of our national industry is not impossible. However, national industrialists and financiers must have a fundamental awakening. They must broaden their horizons and not prioritize personal gain but prioritize the welfare of the people. At the same time, production in all sectors must be carried out in a planned manner.</p>
<p>Why do we say this? The current situation is very clear. Except for the compradores who are under the wing of foreign capitalists, all national industrialists face the same fate. In other words, they are all in the same tragic situation of being squeezed, oppressed, and shackled by foreign capital. Therefore, for the sake of their own businesses and for the sake of national interests, our national industrialists should unite closely on the same national front to jointly promote the development of our national industry and salvage the crisis of our economic future. In the past, our industrialists each prioritized their own interests and used their limited capital to engage in production in a certain sector. They fought individually against external forces and squeezed, competed, and undermined each other internally. Their failure was inevitable. Therefore, in the future, they should work together, cooperate sincerely, strive to regain rights and interests from external forces, and support each other internally to establish the foundation of the national industry. Secondly, in the past, production in all sectors was generally unplanned, and this unplanned state was due to the mutual competition of various industries. This competitive state is like the unplanned production of the American hat industry, as described by some. Most capitalists saw the potential for profit in the hat industry, so they operated many hat factories simultaneously without consulting each other, accelerating production. Then, due to overproduction, sales stagnated. And because sales stagnated, they reduced prices to compete for sales, reduced wages, and laid off workers. The factories eventually could not be sustained and all perished together. After a few years, hats became scarce again, and new competition arose in response. This cyclical tragedy is not unique to the hat industry. It is true for production in all sectors. This is all due to the lack of a holistic plan for production. Therefore, in the future, our industrialists should take this as a warning. They should gather capital to strengthen the production capacity of various sectors and utilize foreign technical talent. They should conduct production based on the needs and consumption power of society to avoid the disadvantages of internal competition and avoid the phenomenon of insufficient or excessive supply. They should prevent the tragedy of mutual undermining and eventual collapse from happening. As for establishing industries, they should prioritize the production of daily necessities for the masses and the production of tools. Other luxury goods and unnecessary consumables, which are only enjoyed by a small number of wealthy classes, can be implemented slowly. Furthermore, industrialists should not only focus on major trading ports but should strive to develop inland areas and exploit their resources. Financiers should not hoard capital and only engage in speculative activities and real estate transactions. They should allocate their surplus funds to support industrialists. Only in this way can our national industry have hope for development and the economic crisis have a chance of being salvaged. We deeply hope that domestic industrialists and financiers will work together to break the current difficult situation.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After arriving in Hong Kong, Jiang Guangnai, the Pacification Commissioner of Fujian, saw the power struggle between the two Chens and did not realize anything, resulting in a relapse of his old illness.

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shaokuan returned to Nanjing on the 17th and spoke to reporters on the 18th: (1) The people's supervision of the navy after the Shanghai Incident is purely out of patriotic enthusiasm, and I feel deeply ashamed. The navy is not afraid of the violent Japanese, but it is because it has not received orders and cannot act rashly. The lack of funding is also the biggest obstacle. (2) Vice-Minister Chen Jiliang resigned, and both the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Navy have been trying to persuade him to stay. However, Chen is still in Xiamen, and it is not yet known whether he will withdraw his resignation. (3) The contract for the construction of the Ninghai warship was signed three years ago. There is a misunderstanding that it should not have been built in Japan. The ship has now been built and is the largest and best of our country's warships. It can return to the fleet once the outstanding fees are paid. (4) The Qiongya issue is a local incident and has nothing to do with the entire navy. (5) Yang Shuzhuang has repeatedly resigned from his position as Chairman of Fujian due to illness and is currently recuperating in Shanghai.

<p>Remarks by a Certain Important Figure in the Diplomatic World</p>
<h3 id="e25">The Rule of Law in Japan <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Rōnin Who Burned Down the Sanyou Company Are All Given Suspended Sentences</p>
<p>This Is What a Country Ruled by Law Is Like</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important figure in the diplomatic world recently commented on the Japanese court's bias in the case of the Japanese rōnin who burned down the Sanyou Industrial Society. He said that the Japanese court sentenced the criminals, Mitsumura Isao and others, who burned down the Sanyou Company and killed and injured Chinese police and civilians, to imprisonment ranging from one year to one year and eight months, but all were given suspended sentences. This kind of judgment is tantamount to encouraging Japanese residents in China to take advantage of extraterritoriality to act arbitrarily without any fear. It has been found that the prosecutor of the court stated in his argument on the case that he could express approval of the fact that Mitsumura and his comrades aimed to protect Japanese residents, and he further justified their actions by saying that they were not based on personal feelings. However, it is not known that the protection of Japanese residents is the responsibility of the consul. How can these unlawful rōnin overstep their authority? Furthermore, these rōnin broke into the Chinese territory, set fires, and killed people, which is clearly an act of disturbance and provocation and has nothing to do with protecting Japanese residents. The law should not be lenient with them. In any country ruled by law, those who break the law must be tried according to the law and cannot be excused in any way. The crimes committed by these rōnin are very serious. It was already inappropriate for the court to impose short prison sentences, and to then give them all suspended sentences is tantamount to acquitting them without punishment. Those who have always disparaged China's judicial system to the extreme should ask themselves how they will react. I dare say that the Chinese courts would never be so biased and unfair.

He also hopes to complete the entire mission. Although the Japanese side has expressed their inability to guarantee safety, this is a matter for the entire Inquiry Commission, and individual concerns should not be considered. At this difficult time, if the government has a mission, no matter how arduous, he will not shirk his duty. He and the Inquiry Commission will stay in Japan for three weeks. The materials obtained by the Inquiry Commission in the Northeast have been organized and the full report will be completed around the end of August, so it can definitely be delivered before the League of Nations General Assembly convenes in September.

<p>Mostly Detained by Japanese Troops</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This reporter interviewed Xu Wenguo, deputy director of the Beining Railway, on the 18th. According to him, since the September 18th Incident, no less than 1,000 of the railway's passenger and freight cars have been detained by Japanese troops. Deposits of 6 million yuan have also been detained, including more than 1 million yuan intended for construction work at Huludao Port, and the remainder for repaying the railway's British debt. The railway cannot be responsible for these two amounts, and the Dutch port management company and the British government have already negotiated with Japan. There has been no news from Huludao in the past two weeks, and it is unknown whether construction has been suspended. Since the railway cannot operate beyond the Guandong area, monthly income has decreased by 2.2 million yuan. The income within the customs is about 1 million yuan per month, barely enough for the salaries of the 30,000-odd employees. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Representatives Busy with Private Contacts</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Returns to Paris to Report Progress</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Lausanne, 18th: Herriot has returned to Paris, and MacDonald has gone to the Savoy Alps for a weekend trip. Today, there are only private contacts between representatives. In the morning, German Chancellor von Papen had a long conversation with French Foreign Minister Grandi. Afterward, Grandi visited German Foreign Minister Curtius, and the German Finance Minister also had a long meeting with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain. It is said that before returning to Lausanne, MacDonald will first go to Geneva to handle the postponement of the Disarmament Conference's General Committee meeting. Reportedly, MacDonald believes there has not been sufficient progress in the Lausanne negotiations, and much will depend on the outcome of Herriot's discussions with key French figures in Paris. ▲ National News Agency, Paris, 18th: This morning, French Prime Minister Herriot returned to Paris from Lausanne to convene an important cabinet meeting. It is expected that the cabinet meeting will discuss some issues arising from Herriot's initial meeting with German Chancellor von Papen. During Herriot's absence, the French delegation will be temporarily led by Finance Minister Martin.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 18th: Herriot returned to France from Lausanne and immediately reported on the meeting's progress to the Council of State. Subsequently, he issued an important statement, saying, "We have extended the period again, but not for hesitation or observation. However, this approach allows the delegations to have flexibility in order to reach a compromise."</p>
<h3 id="e69">France Opposes Abandoning German Reparations <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Lausanne, 17th: France's opposition to canceling German reparations was stated by Herriot in a closed-door meeting today. After German Chancellor von Papen delivered a speech stating that German people's livelihoods were withering, finances were depleted, and they were unable to pay further reparations, French Prime Minister Herriot spoke, using extremely tactful language. First, he said he sympathized with German Chancellor von Papen's eloquent presentation of Germany's plight. France does not want to propose a purely self-serving solution plan and is prepared to cooperate with other countries to realize a plan that can alleviate economic difficulties and enhance peace. Such a plan only requires adequate respect for France's special interests. He then declared that he opposed the complete cancellation of reparations and debts, advocating for gradual cancellation. France will support a gradual cancellation plan, but with the continuation of the German railways bearing this burden as the first condition, because French and British railways are heavily indebted. If the German railways are relieved of this burden, their position will be superior to the French and British railways. The second condition is that there must be a solemn declaration by all countries stating the cessation of the arms race for several years. France advocates stopping the competition for a full ten years.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Britain and Italy Advocate Total Cancellation of War Debts <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 17th: After Herriot finished speaking, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain continued, explaining Britain's policy on war debts and reparations. He said that British public opinion believes that intergovernmental debts are very large, and if they are to be recovered, it will inevitably have a very unfavorable impact on the economic structure of the entire civilization. The British are convinced that only a quick and decisive plan can restore trust. Without trust, the loan wheels will not be able to operate freely. If other related governments express their agreement, the British are prepared to participate in a total write-off action and will not hesitate to continue to sacrifice their legitimate rights, as long as it can contribute to common principles. He felt that only in this spirit could the current difficulties be resolved satisfactorily and the first step towards restoring normalcy be achieved. The real difficulty that the conference must consider is not the ability of country A or country B to pay the debt, but whether the payment of this debt and the instability arising from the effort to pay the debt will become a permanent hazard to maintaining international trade. French Foreign Minister Grandi made a similar declaration, and Japanese representative Yoshida then strongly emphasized the importance of the joint declaration of the five creditor nations this morning. After representatives from small countries such as Greece, Portugal, Yugoslavia, and Romania spoke in succession, the meeting was adjourned until the following Tuesday. MacDonald, Simon, and French Foreign Minister Grandi will travel to Geneva together at the end of this week. The French here have now expressed their opinion that they do not consider the method announced by Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, and Japan this morning to extend the payment period during the conference to be perfect, saying that this move will subject the signatory countries to an indefinite extension of payment obligations.</p>
<h3 id="e71">The US Can Only Agree to Extend the Suspension Period <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 17th: Today, people in the US government have acknowledged that the Lausanne Conference has an intention to request the cancellation of war debts, but they have indicated that such a request will be met with a cold reception. It is said that the United States does not even want to discuss the matter, as the money must be settled. It is more appropriate to recover it from the borrowers than from the American taxpayers. However, observers now believe that if the Lausanne Conference allows Germany to temporarily suspend reparations payments, then the United States may also extend the period of the Hoover moratorium.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 17th: The news that Germany may temporarily not continue paying reparations pending a conference to resolve this difficulty has been received with calm in Germany. Reports say that this is the smallest concession that can be expected and does not mean that the creditor nations have actually agreed to abandon all reparations claims. It is hoped that the reparations conference can quickly make a judgment that Germany is currently and hereafter unable to pay reparations. The only reasonable outcome of future meetings would be the abandonment of all demands on Germany.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Lausanne, 18th: Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss arrived here this morning from Vienna to discuss the conditions for providing financial relief to Austria with politicians and experts from various countries. According to reliable sources, France has indicated that it must insist that Austria completely abandon the idea of ​​German-Austrian unification before it agrees to participate in any action to relieve Austria.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Athens, 17th: Greek Prime Minister Venizelos is unable to attend the Lausanne Conference due to typhoid fever and has appointed Foreign Minister Michalopoulos, who is already in Lausanne, as the chief representative.</p>
<p>Reuters Correction: In the Lausanne dispatch of the 17th issued last night, there was a phrase "[Great Britain will sacrifice 200 billion English pounds]." The incoming telegram has corrected the error, and "[200 billion English pounds]" should be "[200 million English pounds]," which is 200,000,000 pounds.</p>
<p>League of Nations General Assembly to be Postponed</p>
<h3 id="e74">Discussing the Dong Province Issue <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Japan Expresses Unreasonable Opposition</p>
<p>▲ Jiji Press, Tokyo, 18th: League of Nations authorities, because the Inquiry Commission's report cannot arrive in Geneva before the scheduled date of August 12, plan to convene a board meeting around June 25 to discuss extending the deadline for the Inquiry Commission's report to be submitted to the League of Nations authorities and to determine the procedure. It has already sent a letter to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notifying them of this matter. The League of Nations' view is to extend the deadline for submitting the report by four months, setting the submission deadline as December 12, and to convene the League of Nations General Assembly in December of this year to discuss the Manchuria issue. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities are currently considering what attitude to take toward the League of Nations' notification. The heads of the government hold strong opinions on this, namely, that the dispatch of the China Inquiry Commission was decided by the Board of Directors in accordance with Article 11 of the League of Nations Charter, so the handling of the Manchuria issue should be led by the Board of Directors. Japan absolutely opposes extending the report submission date and the General Assembly handling the Manchuria issue for this reason.</p>
<p>▲ Den Tsushin, Tokyo, 18th: The League of Nations Temporary General Assembly has decided to convene in mid-November. Foreign Ministry officials have informally approved of this, but a part of the Foreign Ministry thinks that it is too early to approve, and feels that it is inappropriate. The intention is as follows: At the Board of Directors meeting on February 11, the Chinese side requested the application of Provision 15, Section 9, moving the Sino-Japanese dispute to the League of Nations General Assembly. The Board of Directors meeting on the 29th decided to move the case to the General Assembly on March 3, but only for the Shanghai Incident. However, the Shanghai Incident formally established a ceasefire agreement on May 5, and the remaining issues returned to roundtable discussions. Therefore, the application of Provision 15 and the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly has in fact been eliminated. The League of Nations General Assembly is delaying the temporary General Assembly until November, citing the delay of the investigation report, because the General Assembly wants to handle the Manchuria issue. It is very clear that the Japanese authorities did not pay attention to this matter, and even telegraphed Ambassador Nagaoka to France, acknowledging the delay of the General Assembly, which violates Japan's established policy. Therefore, Japan's argument is that the Manchuria issue concerns a newly established country, and Manchuria is not subordinate to the League of Nations, so the League of Nations General Assembly should not take measures to affirm the Manchuria issue.</p>

<p>Declaring Compliance with All International Obligations</p>
<p>Planning to Convene Congress to Draft New Constitution</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Valparaiso, 17th: The socialist government of Chile, only ten days after its establishment, has been overthrown. The new government has a more moderate attitude, so there is hope that the situation will gradually stabilize. The leader of the new government is former Ambassador to the United States Davila, who was rejected by the left wing and left the socialist government a few days ago. Davila told reporters today that the new government will comply with all international obligations. At the same time, the new government also issued a declaration, stating that the authorities plan to convene Congress immediately to draft a new constitution. Before Congress is convened, the new government will temporarily govern. According to authorities, police seized important documents confirming that left-wing leader Grove was instructed by the Soviet Union, so it has been decided to deport Grove. Grove's political career has thus ended with his short-lived socialist government. Foreign merchants have great confidence in the new government. Many British merchants, fearing destruction by the socialist government, had planned to return home by ship, but have now returned their tickets and will not return home.</p>

<p>▲ Japanese Military Department's Three Chief Officers' Meeting</p>
<p>Decides to Send Masaki to Manchuria</p>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The Japanese military department held a three chief officers' meeting at the Army Minister's official residence at 10:30 AM today. The contents discussed were the unification of the four-headed politics, the recognition of the puppet state, the attitude to be taken toward the League of Nations, and the increase in the strength of the Kwantung Army. It is said that the opinions of Vice Chief of Staff Masaki, Director General of Education Hayashi, and Army Minister Araki were consistent. Vice Chief of Staff Masaki will go to Manchuria via Korea within a few days. En route, he will discuss the Russian-Korean border defense issues and Korean military issues with Governor-General Ugaki, and hold a three-headed meeting in Shenyang with Commander Honjo and Earl Uchida to discuss various policies towards Manchuria.

<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: According to the Tokyo report, Uchida Yasushi accepted the Foreign Minister post with the following five conditions. It is said that Prime Minister Saito also expressed sympathy: (1) In order to comfort the hearts of the puppet Manchurian people, Japan must promptly recognize the independence of the puppet state. (2) In order to prepare for the recognition of the puppet state, Japan must promptly establish an economic policy towards Manchuria, confirm existing treaties, and reorganize matters related to customs duties. (3) Japan wants to seek an outlet for its economy in Manchuria, so it must first reorganize the Japanese-Manchurian economy and prepare for closer relations. There are four new policies towards Manchuria: (a) Gather national capital and invest it in Manchuria and Mongolia, and immigration must be carried out simultaneously; (b) Develop the resources of Manchuria and Mongolia to supply materials to Japanese industry; expand the organization of the Manchurian railways and give full play to its capabilities; (c) All Manchurian railways and Chinese railways shall be managed by the South Manchurian Railway (SMR); (d) The government must assist capital and make the SMR fulfill its duties as a colonization company. (4) In order to eliminate the drawbacks of the four-headed politics, a policy centered on the SMR should be adopted, and various agencies should be reorganized for convenience. (5) In order to renew the policy towards Manchuria, the government must gather officials from relevant provinces and private industrialists to form an advisory body to the government.</p>

<p>▲ Havas, Munich, 17th: Due to the disturbances caused by National Socialist Party members at this morning's state parliament meeting, the Bavarian government has decided to continue maintaining the order prohibiting members of all political parties from wearing uniforms within the territory until September 30. At this morning's parliament meeting, National Socialist Party members attended in uniform, disrupting order. The speaker tried to stop them, but they shouted loudly. The speaker had no choice but to order them to leave the chamber. National Socialist Party member Esser rushed to the speaker's seat and shouted, "Down with the Bavarian State Government!" Order broke down, and the meeting was immediately adjourned. The National Socialist Party members sang party songs and left together. At the second meeting, the speaker announced that all National Socialist Party members were prohibited from attending for a week as punishment. This sparked another dispute, and the speaker called the police into the hall to expel the National Socialist Party members, including Deputy Speaker Schwaeder.</p>

<p>Manchurian Immigration Plan</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, the Ministry of Interior's Social Bureau, in order to solve the unemployment problem, has established a Manchurian immigration plan. After conducting detailed investigations into various aspects such as Manchuria's industrial needs, environment, climate, and labor force, the ministry has drafted the following immigration plan: (1) Industrial laborers are most needed in Manchuria's specialty industries such as soybean oil production, soda industry, iron and steel industry, and coal industry, and should be transferred there quickly. As for unskilled laborers in our country, they are currently not needed in Manchuria, so efforts should be made to prevent them from going there. (2) Civil engineering and construction laborers are also very important due to the implementation of Manchuria's urban planning, railways, telegraphs, telephones, etc., and should be sent there in an organized manner. (3) Intellectuals are currently severely lacking in Manchuria. Doctors, pharmacists, educators, and others with strong will are welcome to immigrate to Manchuria in large numbers.</p>

<p>Russian Officials of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun, Harbin Dispatch: When our army (the Japanese army) was using a train to return in triumph from the eastern line of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it suddenly derailed, causing many deaths and injuries. After this incident occurred, there were several reports, but the main culprit was never apprehended. Until early June, it was discovered that several accomplices were hiding at Cheng Gaozi Station. The military police learned of this and rushed to the location, arresting Chinese Eastern Railway officials, Russians, Boris Mousse, Magalenko, Gottmieux, and Maliyoko. It is reported that the Russian side will express an important attitude towards the Japanese army's arrest of Chinese Eastern Railway officials.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Harbin Strange Robbery Case <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>▲ Bandits Rob the Residence of the Director of the Eastern Railway</p>
<p>▲ Police Squad of Three Hundred Surrounds for Six Hours</p>
<p>▲ Holding the Victim's Family Hostage, They Leave by Car</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since the Northeast fell into the hands of the Japanese army, military connections have been established. As of August, the people have lost their land, workers have lost their jobs, and scholars have lost their schools. The decline of society is becoming increasingly extreme. Major ports such as Jilin, Changchun, Liaoning, and Harbin are all experiencing commercial depression and market downturn. Therefore, the number of unemployed people is increasing daily. Those with lofty aspirations and a desire for revenge go to join the volunteer army and carry out the movement to restore the country. Those of lesser ambition, in order to solve their current living problems, engage in banditry. As a result, bandits are rampant everywhere. Even in Harbin, despite the Japanese army's rampaging and dense network of henchmen, several robbery cases occur every day. The puppet state's police exhaust their efforts but cannot prevent them. On the 11th of this month, the residence of Zhang Shu, the puppet director of the Eastern Railway, was also visited by four bandits. Although they did not steal any property, the bandits confronted the surrounding police, numbering over three hundred, for six hours. In the end, they took the victim's family as hostages and calmly escaped. This is the largest bandit case in the Northeast in recent times and must be recorded. Zhang Shu was the chief of staff when Sun Liechen was the military governor of Jilin and is one of the old Northeastern soldiers. He has served as a director of the Eastern Railway for several years, even serving as director last year. After the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, Zhang had a close relationship with Xi Qia and strongly supported Xi Qia's plan to become the puppet Jilin governor. When Ding and Li resisted Japan in Harbin, Zhang secretly helped Xi Qia to overthrow Ding and Li. After the establishment of the puppet state, he had almost become one of the founding heroes. It is a pity that he has not yet obtained an important position. Wang Zhiyou, the commander-in-chief of the vanguard of the Self-Defense Army, was lured to Harbin by Zhang because of their close relationship, and was placed under house arrest and not allowed to return. This caused the Ding-Xing Self-Defense Army to lose a senior commander responsible for directing the army, and it was eventually defeated by the Japanese army. Therefore, from Zhang's personal perspective, he is a loyal minister of the puppet state and a good friend of Xi Qia. But from the perspective of us, the divine Chinese descendants, he is, without a doubt, the number one Chinese traitor. Zhang obtained the position of puppet director of the Eastern Railway because of this, with a very generous monthly salary. His residence is located at No. 47 Gongsiju Street in Nangang, Eastern Railway, in a ten-story Western-style building, living in extreme luxury. On the morning of the 11th, at 7:00 AM, Zhang had not yet gotten out of bed when two middle-aged men, both wearing blue serge Western suits and hats, one resembling the owner and the other resembling a follower, arrived at Zhang's door. They went up the steps and rang the doorbell. The doorman came out to answer. The one resembling the owner held</p>

<p>a letter, writing "[Director Zhang's regards]" and gave it to Zhang, claiming to have been sent by Zhang Zuoxiang and had confidential matters to see Director Zhang. The doorman replied that the owner was not up yet, and the guest was invited inside to wait. The doorman did not dare to refuse and invited them into the living room. At this time, two other men, both around 24 or 25 years old, one wearing a blue serge Western suit and the other wearing a blue cloth gown, resembling students, walked in through the back door of Zhang's residence. Zhang's servant caught a glimpse of them and immediately greeted them with a knife, asking what they were doing. The two men claimed to be secret agents from the Japanese Military Police Department, saying that they had just seen two suspicious-looking people enter the residence, that these two people were from Fengtian and were reactionaries, and that they needed to be arrested. The servant did not understand the truth and allowed them to enter the house. The two men also greeted the two street police officers guarding the back door to come in, as if asking for their assistance. At this time, the first two men were still in the living room. The letter they claimed was from Zhang Zuoxiang was taken by a maid and sent to Zhang Shu's bedroom. Zhang opened the letter and discovered many suspicious points. Just as he was wondering and about to put on his clothes to ask, the two men who had arrived later were also invited into the living room by the servant. After the two groups of guests met, they suddenly drew their guns, ordering the servants not to move and disarming the two street police officers. Because of the noise, a maid in the outer room heard it and rushed into Zhang Shu's bedroom to report. Upon hearing the news, Zhang immediately locked the bedroom door and jumped out of the back window, running to the nearby Industrial University to borrow a telephone and report to various parties. Soon, the entire puppet police brigade, the garrison team, the detective team, and the Third Office, totaling about three hundred people, rushed to the scene and surrounded Zhang's residence several times, intending to open fire and attack. At this time, the bandits searched for Zhang Shu inside and could not find him. Seeing the police surrounding the area, they knew that the matter had been exposed. They immediately forced Zhang's family members into the living room, forbidding them from moving, and sent a servant to shout outside the door, saying that if the police opened fire, they would completely kill Zhang's family members. At this time, Zhang Shu was also in the street, hearing this, he was extremely frightened and hurriedly persuaded the police not to open fire. The police complied with the victim's request, only taking a surrounding posture and remotely monitoring. This stalemate lasted for a long time. The bandits could not escape, and the police did not dare to open fire. The Japanese military police heard the news at 11:30 AM and arrived with more than twenty people, also intending to open fire. However, after Zhang Shu's pleading and request for them to retreat, the Japanese military police immediately withdrew. Around 12:00 PM, the bandits searched from one room and found Zhang's friend Wang Zhiyou (former commander-in-chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, currently the deputy minister of the Xi Qia army's Harbin Special Service Department) and demanded that Wang go outside to tell Zhang to prepare 10,000 yuan in cash, 20,000 rounds of ammunition, and that the police immediately retreat and send a special car for them to leave, otherwise there would be trouble. Wang went outside to tell Zhang, but Zhang had no way to arrange it and immediately sent Cheng Delin, the patrol chief of the Third Office, inside to persuade the bandits that cash and ammunition were not easy to arrange, but that the police could retreat and a special car could be sent. The bandits initially refused, but because the stalemate had lasted too long, many Chinese and foreigners were gathered on the street to watch, fearing other changes, they only asked Zhang to prepare a small car to send them away. The police team immediately retreated, and Zhang complied. Subsequently, the detectives, according to Zhang's request, completely withdrew. Zhang also offered a price of 1,500 yuan to hire a small car to transport them, but no one dared to respond. Later, Wang Zhiyou summoned the military special service department's car number two and drove it into Zhang's courtyard. The bandits ordered the driver to lower the window curtains and park in the center of the courtyard. First, they had a servant get into the car. After ten minutes, seeing no movement, they ordered him out of the car. Then, they ordered another servant to get into the car. After another ten minutes, they had him get out. The two bandits then got into the car. Shortly after, the other two bandits took Zhang's relatives, Liu and Wang, into the car, and with their guns, forced the driver to drive away at full speed. By this time, it was 1:25 PM. When the car passed the street corner, the Chinese and Russian onlookers were in a sea of people, shouting and applauding. Later, the car drove to Xiangfang, where the bandits got out of the car. More than ten people were waiting for them, and they took the four bandits away. Before leaving, the bandits handed over a pistol seized from the street police officer to the driver and told him to take it back. When the bandits got into the car, two bandits changed into the blue gowns of the servants, and took out 200 yuan in cash from a pocket and placed it on the table. They left calmly, without taking anything. Therefore, some people say that the four were not bandits, but members of the Self-Defense Army or Volunteer Army. (11th)</p>

<p>Return to Hankou After the Lushan Conference</p>
<p>▲ Xiao Zhichu Briefly Talks About the Conference Situation</p>
<p>▲ Chiang to Increase Two Divisions to Assist in Suppressing Hubei Bandits</p>
<p>▲ Guangji County Magistrate Relieved of Post for Losing City and Sent to the Province for Trial</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Lushan Conference, which began on the 14th, lasted for three consecutive days. The general direction for diplomacy, finance, and military affairs has been largely decided. Xu Yuanquan, the director of Qingxiang in Hubei Province, along with Xiao Zhichu, commander of the 44th Division, Yu Feipeng, vice minister of the Ministry of Transportation, Qian Zongze, vice minister of the Ministry of Railways, He Jingwu, director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, Lin Xiang, director of the Transportation Department of the General Headquarters, and others, left the mountain and returned to Hankou on the Jiangjing Steamer. They arrived at the port at 1:00 PM on the 17th. Xu felt slightly ill due to fatigue along the way and returned to his private residence to rest after arriving. According to Xiao Zhichu, he briefly said: "This time I went to Xunyang to meet Chairman Chiang and report on the bandit suppression situation in Hubei Province. Chairman Chiang said that the armies of Hubei Province have worked hard to suppress the bandits and have suffered many casualties. Many brigade and regimental commanders have also been injured. In addition to praising them, he was very concerned and ordered them to maintain their determination and continue to work hard to completely eliminate the remaining bandits. As for the Lushan gathering, in addition to military and political personnel from Hubei Province, Chairman He Yunqiao (Jian) from Hunan Province, Minister He Jingzhi (Yingqin) from Jiangxi Province, Chairman Xiong Tianyi (Shihui), Army Commander Chen Xiucheng, and others from the capital, such as Dean Wang and others, also went by plane. There was a detailed discussion on military, financial, diplomatic, and bandit suppression matters. In military affairs, uniformity was sought, and the regulations of the Military Commission were used as a unit, with each army directly commanding two divisions. If a certain division had a large number of people, another division would be formed, and military expenses would also be increased appropriately. In order to thoroughly eliminate the bandits in Hubei, Chairman Chiang will also increase the 10th Division of Wei Lihuang and the 83rd Division of Jiang Fusheng to Hubei to assist in the suppression. Wan Yaohuang's 13th Division will advance towards Jingshan to assist the 10th Army in searching and suppressing the remaining bandits in central Hubei. The defense of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway will be filled by the 89th Division of Tang Enbo. Director He Xuezhuan will meet with Director Liu Xueya and then go down the mountain and return to Hankou. Civil Affairs Director Zhu Huaibing and Construction Director Li Shucheng will return together after the joint meeting. I will stay in Hankou for three days and then go to Yingcheng to command." It is reported that the weather in Lushan has recently turned cold, and everyone is sick. Chiang is also slightly ill and will come to Hankou only after all plans have been completely decided. Xia Douyin will be able to return to Hankou on the 19th. Wan Yaohuang took the Jiangshun steamer west on the 17th and will arrive on the 18th. Finance Director Shen Zhaonian went to Nanjing on the 17th on Xia Douyin's orders to pay respects to Finance Minister Song Ziwen and request an increase in subsidies. If Song had not returned to Beijing, he would also go to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The military situation for bandit suppression in Hubei Province has remained tense in recent days. In eastern Hubei, Xu Xiangqian's puppet Fourth Front Army of the Red Army has withdrawn from the county seat of Guangji due to pressure from the army and air force. The 47th Division has now all arrived in Wuxue, and part of it has been stationed in Guangji, coordinating with local gentry to handle the aftermath. County Magistrate Dong of the county has been relieved of his post for losing the county seat. Chairman Chiang ordered the Pacification Headquarters to instruct Shangguan Yunxiang to transfer the troops stationed in Guangji and send him to the province for trial. The vacancy will be filled by a capable person. In western and central Hubei, the battle between the army and the bandits is even more fierce. He Long personally led Wang Yuming's puppet 7th Division to occupy the area around Su Lake in Qianjiang. Duan Yulin's puppet 8th Division occupied Jingshan, and Duan Dechang's puppet 9th Division occupied Zhangjiegang. He Long and Wang Lingji's Sichuan army are in a stalemate, and Duan and Zhang Zhenhan's division are in a stalemate. According to reports from the front, Wang's troops have won successive victories after recovering Qianjiang and are now fiercely attacking Su Lake. Wang himself has moved from Yichang to Shashi to supervise the suppression and has telegraphed Liu Xiang to increase the dispatch of two brigades to Hubei to assist in the suppression. Zhang's division recovered Yuxin River. On the 14th, they fought a bloody battle with the bandits at Sanwen River and Huanxin River. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Tanbutou and Zhangjiegang. On the 15th, the division issued a general attack order, supervised by Division Commander Zhang Zhenhan. After a long and fierce battle, the 25th Regiment of the puppet 9th Division reinforced the front line, and the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th Regiments of the puppet 8th Division also arrived at the river bank to confront the government troops. On the 16th, Zhang Zhenhan still supervised the Meng and Niu Regiments to charge with bayonets, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat, and broke through the Red Army's Caijia Temple position. The bandits then retreated in droves, and the government troops successively occupied Huangjiatai, Qingle Temple, and Chenjiazu areas. At that time, it was raining heavily, and it was difficult to move the troops, so they were unable to pursue. As soon as the weather clears, they will continue to search and suppress. (June 17)</p>

<p>Bandit Suppression and Pacification</p>
<p>▲ Guangdong Army Moves Troops to Monitor Bandit Gangs in Eastern Jiangxi</p>
<p>▲ Xie Yuanhan Appointed Pacification Commissioner of Southern Jiangxi</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The communist bandits in Zhangzhou, after withdrawing, intended to return to their base camp in eastern Jiangxi, and the areas of Xinfeng, Longnan, and Qiannan in southern Jiangxi are actually close to the bandit areas in eastern Jiangxi. The original garrison in Xinfeng was the 4th Division of the 2nd Guangdong Army, led by Zhang Meixin. Zhang recently came to the province to discuss official matters with Chen Jitang. It was recently heard that the bandits in eastern Jiangxi were rampant, so he took the Yuehan train to Shao on the morning of the 10th, carrying a large number of military supplies. He transported them to Jiangxi by land from Shao. Zhang himself first returned to Xinfeng by plane from Shao. It is heard that the task of Zhang's division will focus on the San Nan area, and a certain unit will be transferred from the First Army to Xinfeng to assist in the defense. In addition, the suppression of Peng Dehuai and Li Mingrui's two bandit gangs in western Jiangxi will be carried out by the Second Division and the Independent First Brigade to cut off the connection between Peng and Li's bandits and the various gangs in eastern Jiangxi. It was found that after Peng and Li's two gangs were defeated and fled to Guidong County in eastern Hunan, the 2nd Division of the 1st Guangdong Army, led by Ye Zhao, advanced to Chongyi, and the 2nd Division's training regiment stationed at Changmeisi, led by Deng Qichang, also joined the 4th Battalion of the division and crossed the Jiangkou to pursue them. They cleared the remaining bandits in the area. According to a telegram report from the regiment, the regiment and Xiao Battalion of the 4th Regiment were ordered to go to the Guobu area to suppress the communist bandits. Upon arriving at the destination, they searched everywhere. More than a thousand bandits were defeated. On the 7th, the Hunan army and our army surrounded the bandits in two directions. The battle was fierce. It is estimated that countless bandits were killed in the battle, and many weapons were seized. The remaining bandits were defeated and scattered. Currently, there is no food in Guotian Guobu and other places in Chongyi. All food is transported from Nanxiong and Dayu. It was also heard that Yu Hanmou recently convened a military meeting in Nan'an to discuss and decide on the second phase of the communist suppression plan. As for the seventeen counties in southern Jiangxi, since the Guangdong army recovered them, the local area has not yet recovered from the devastation, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt. Yu Hanmou has also ordered his subordinates to rush to handle the aftermath and pacification matters. At the same time, he plans to build a highway from Ganzhou through Nan'an to Dayu on the Guangdong border, to accommodate the refugees in the area and provide work as relief. As for the aftermath and pacification, the Southern Jiangxi Seventeen Counties Pacification Office has been established as the presiding authority. The central government has appointed Xie Yuanhan, the former governor of Jiangxi Province, as the pacification commissioner. Xie traveled south from Shanghai a month ago, passing through Guangzhou, and then went to Nanxiong, and then took a sedan chair from Yuling to take office in southern Jiangxi. (June 13)</p>

<p>Drafts Financial Management Plan</p>
<p>▲ Gu Zhutong Goes to Beijing to Meet with the Central Government</p>
<p>▲ If the Result is Satisfactory, the Intention to Resign Can be Dismissed</p>
<p>Governor Gu Zhutong and all the members of the Jiangsu Provincial Government resigned en masse due to financial difficulties. After the State Council resolved to send a telegram to express their condolences and retain them, they were instructed to propose a plan to reorganize the finances. It is now learned that the provincial government, after receiving the order, has already drafted the plan, and its contents are divided into six items: (1) Salt tax (2) Surtax on tobacco and alcohol (designated for road construction) (3) Special business tax (4) Recovery of liquor license tax for self-management (5) Transformation of ordinary business tax into business license tax (6) Clearing of land tax, starting with clearing the land area, and selecting five counties for pilot implementation, to be completed within six months. This plan was taken to Nanjing by Gu Zhutong and Zhou FoHai yesterday afternoon to discuss with President Wang. Whether or not Governor Gu and others can dismiss their resignation will depend on whether the plan can be adopted and implemented by the central government. According to Finance Director Shu Shifu's statement to reporters, the financial reorganization plan proposed by the provincial government this time does have some violations of the central government's regulations and increases the burden on the people, but Jiangsu Province's finances have reached the end of their rope, and there is really no other way.</p>

<p>▲ Nine New Prisons to be Completed in Five Years</p>
<p>▲ Total Cost of One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Chen Changzu, the former president of the Hunan Higher Court, vigorously planned to build a new prison in the provincial capital during his tenure to improve the judiciary. He sold the land of the old Changsha prison and the Zixin Institute and obtained more than 100,000 yuan. He also obtained 100,000 yuan from the Ministry of Justice and planned to build the first new prison outside the North Gate. Construction was underway when he suddenly received an order from the ministry to be transferred to the president of the Hubei Higher Court, and Xu Shengjin succeeded him as president of the Hunan Court. Xu took office in Hunan last month. Because building a new prison is an important measure for regaining jurisdiction over foreign affairs, he still plans to actively complete the first new prison in Changsha. He will also divide the entire province into nine districts and build a total of nine new prisons. It is expected to be completed within five years at a total cost of approximately one million yuan. All judicial expenses allocated by the Ministry will be withheld and used. If it is not enough, the Hunan Provincial Government will provide subsidies. Yang XuanYou has been appointed to be responsible for planning the construction of new prisons throughout the province.

<p>▲ Establishing a Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Telephone Line There was an original long-distance telephone line established by the Ministry of Transportation between Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. However, because the established line was a single iron wire, the sound quality was extremely unclear, which caused great inconvenience to the public. The Jiangsu Construction Department is now preparing to establish a Zhenjiang-Yangzhou telephone line in order to promote balanced development in both the north and south of the Yangtze River. The Zhenjiang-Yangzhou telephone line is also a trunk line connecting the north and south of the Yangtze River and should be completed as soon as possible in order to gradually expand it. It is heard that the department has drafted a plan and submitted it to the provincial government for approval in order to start the project.</p>
<p>▲ Planning to Establish Martyrs' Parks Xiong Martyr Chengji and other parks have not yet been completed. The provincial government meeting has decided to hand them over to the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments, ordering them to send personnel to conduct inspections, prepare plans, submit them for discussion, and prepare separately to express respect for the martyrs. The Civil Affairs and Construction Departments have already commissioned Zhu Xi, a technician from the Construction Department, to conduct inspections and handle the matter.</p>
<p>▲ Protecting the Honghu Great Embankment The Hongze Lake Great Embankment is a hundred miles long from north to south and more than two rods (丈) high. It is all stonework and is the first important barrier for Huaiyang. It is extremely important. It has been heard that the Yangzhou office of the Canal Workers Relief Association has received a telegram from the chief supervisor, Chen Bomeng, stating that the stonework of the Honghu Embankment is mostly incomplete, and the stone slabs on the embankment surface, broken stones, bricks, and other materials have suffered even greater losses than sixteen years ago. If it is not repaired for a long time, the entire embankment will be destroyed, etc. It immediately sent a letter to the Huaihe River Conservancy Commission transferring it to the Anhui Provincial Government for investigation and handling, and also sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering the Huaiyin County Government to protect it properly. The provincial government handed it over to the Construction Department for handling. It is heard that the department believes that the embankment is of utmost importance and cannot be neglected in the slightest. It has ordered the county government to protect it properly in order to strengthen the embankment defense.</p>

<p>▲ Troops Stationed in Xin Zhuang Depart for Sea When the Japanese started provoking conflicts in Shanghai, the situation on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway became tense. Xin Zhuang Town, bordering Shanghai, had been designated as the second line of defense. The troops of the Infantry 1st Regiment of the Tax Police Corps, led by Regiment Commander Zhao Zimai, were stationed there to protect the area. The Public Association, the District Public Office, the Town Chamber of Commerce, and others jointly formed a local maintenance association to maintain order in the area. The army and the people were in harmony. Recently, the regiment received orders from their superiors to transfer to Haizhou for garrison. The local Public Association, feeling grateful for Regiment Commander Zhao's protection of the area, jointly presented a silk banner with the four characters "Qing He Feng Gao (琴鹤风高)", to express their appreciation. Today (18th), when Regiment Commander Zhao left Xin Zhuang, District Chief Zhang Baoyuan and local gentry went to the station to see him off.

<p>▲ The Nineteenth Route Army Marches Out Yesterday Morning to Resist Japan: Regarding the order for the Nineteenth Route Army to proceed and suppress bandits, it is now known that the headquarters of the 119th Brigade of the 60th Division of the army, along with its regiments and battalions, left Suzhou for Nanjing on the 16th. The headquarters of the Nineteenth Army and the 60th Division departed in four trains at 8:00 AM on the 17th to go to Nanjing. All sectors of Wu County, having received news of the Nineteenth Route Army's departure in advance, sent representatives to the station at 7:00 AM on the 17th to see them off. Qiu Kun carried out the send-off speech, and photos were taken to commemorate the occasion. On that day, all stores in the city and suburbs uniformly displayed flags to send them off. The 87th Division of the Fifth Army, which had been garrisoned in Suzhou, will arrive in Suzhou shortly to replace the garrison.</p>
<p>▲ Suzhou and Wu County Schedule Regulated Rice Sales: The Wu County government, in order to provide relief to the common people, has decided to hold regulated rice sales.

<p>▲厅委調查搶米風潮: Investigation of Rice-Seizing Incidents by Commissioners from the Department: Luo Chengqiao, Gao Zhen, and Hua Yinchun, commissioners from the Department of Industry, came to Wuxi from the province the day before yesterday due to the rice-seizing incidents in the county, which threatened to affect the entire county, to conduct an on-site investigation. They went directly to the county government and invited County Magistrate Chen to investigate the truth in the countryside. Because County Magistrate Chen had other important official duties, he was unable to go. The commissioners then hired a motorboat at 9:00 AM on the (17th) and sailed to Zhangjing Bridge in the 7th District and Anzhen in the 8th District to investigate. After arriving in the countryside, they met with Shen Nianhong, assistant public security officer of Zhangjing Bridge, Hua Yanfen, the head of the town, Xu Haojiu, the head of Danjia Township, Feng Aifu, the director of the Farmers' Education Center, etc. In Anzhen, they met with Zhang Zongqi, assistant to the district public office, Huang Junyu, the head of the town, and local farmers, etc., and inquired in detail about the truth of the rice-seizing incidents and the reasons for the decline of the rural economy. The general consensus was that the rural areas were densely populated, but the arable land was limited, with each household averaging only about five mu of cultivated land, and rented land accounted for more than half of that, so food was already scarce. This year's silkworm crop was poor, and the price of silk plummeted. In the Anzhen area alone, the annual income from silkworm cocoons was around 200,000 yuan, but this year it was only one-tenth or one-twelfth of that. In addition, the wheat crop was poor and the selling price was low, resulting in even greater losses. Pawnshops in the four townships, due to the tight money supply in the market, were depressing the value of goods worth one yuan to one or two jiao. Farmers, seeing this situation, have become desperate, and as a result, rice-seizing incidents have arisen. Commissioner Luo, et al., informed them that the immediate solution was relief, but the decline of the rural economy could not be restored with one or two instances of relief. The only way forward was to revive the silk industry, promote side businesses, and increase production. The County Agricultural Improvement Center is currently adding sixteen autumn silkworm rearing guidance centers, which can be contacted for implementation. After the investigation, they returned to the city. It is reported that Commissioners Luo and Gao returned to the province yesterday (18th), and Commissioner Hua Yinchun will remain in Wuxi to handle all unfinished investigations and future liaison matters.</p>
<p>▲ Nineteenth Route Army Disbands Iron-Blooded Army: Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the Nineteenth Route Army resisted the Japanese in Shanghai, and enthusiastic people from all over organized volunteer armies and iron-blooded groups to go to Shanghai to join the Nineteenth Route Army. Commander Cai, recognizing their patriotic enthusiasm but noting that they had not received military training, assigned them to Weng Zhaoyuan, the brigade commander of the 156th Brigade, for thorough training. In the blink of an eye, four months have passed. Now that the Shanghai Incident has come to an end, and the Nineteenth Route Army has been ordered to go to Fujian to suppress bandits, the brigade is about to depart, and the former volunteer army is no longer needed. Moreover, the training period has expired, so a graduation ceremony was held a few days ago, and the student volunteer army was sent home first. All the iron-blooded troops accompanying the army were also disbanded. This army had more than 3,000 men, all composed of people from all over. In addition to the original firearms, each was equipped with a broadsword. Except for more than 1,000 people who volunteered to go to Fujian Province to suppress bandits, the rest were all sent home yesterday, each given two yuan for travel expenses. All the broadswords were allowed to be taken home. Before leaving, Brigade Commander Weng gave a sincere speech, which deeply moved the listeners.</p>
<p>▲ Robbery Occurs Outside the East Gate: Cai Shigen, a farmer from Youdu Li Shang Ma Dun outside the East Gate, was visited by a boat with four bandits armed with pistols the night before last. They opened the door under the pretext of asking for information and ransacked the place, stealing more than 100 yuan. They then went to the house of Long Ajun next door.

<p>▲ Kidnapping Case Occurs Again in Shazhou City: At 2:00 AM on the 16th, a sand boat suddenly appeared on the river surface in Xiaosha, Changyinsha, in the Nansha District of this county. The local defense corps went to inspect it and saw many people wearing uniforms, who claimed to be patrolmen of the anti-smuggling team. The defense corps did not suspect anything. Unexpectedly, more than 20 people came ashore and rushed to the defense corps headquarters, tied up six corps members, and robbed them of four rifles and one Mauser pistol. They then went to the house of Liu Defeng in Housheng Township and robbed them of two leather suitcases and clothing, etc. Then they went to the homes of Wang Caisheng and the Xue family and plundered them. Before leaving, they kidnapped the victims Liu Defeng, Xue Zuren, and one of Wang Caisheng's daughters, boarded the boat, and roared away.</p>
<p>▲ Local Maintenance Association Concludes: Previously, due to the large number of troops gathered in the county, local agencies in this county jointly formed a local public security maintenance association to facilitate supply and reception, which lasted for three months. Now that the troops stationed in Changshu have departed one after another, the maintenance association is no longer necessary. On the afternoon of the 16th, the association convened a meeting of all its members, about 40 people, to hold a closing meeting. It was resolved that all unfinished matters, such as ships that had not yet been returned, should be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for handling. The timber from the previous construction projects and floating bridges, etc., should be entrusted to the district heads to order the town heads to recover and send them to the county government, etc., and handed over to the various agencies for continued handling and conclusion. As for the maintenance association itself, it was decided to end on the 16th, and the accounts would be sorted out and submitted for verification. It is estimated that the cost of entertaining the troops and building fortifications, etc., totaled more than 130,000 yuan.</p>

This time, the district office is forcibly collecting self-government household donations and defense corps donations, which the people are really unable to bear. On the 15th, they jointly submitted a petition to the county government to stop the collection.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Labor University Students Issue a Declaration of Protecting the School <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲ Hosted the Press Yesterday</p>
<p>The Labor University Student School Protection Association hosted the press at 3:00 PM yesterday at the school's office. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. First, Chairman Gao Zongyi reported, stating that the Ministry of Education had recently ordered the Labor University to close down on the grounds that its past achievements were not significant and that it was difficult to recover from the losses suffered in the Shanghai war. In the short history of five years, of course, there were no significant achievements to speak of. This time, the Ministry of Education did not plan to gradually recover from the losses suffered in the war but instead ordered the school to close down, which was no different from kicking someone when they were down. All the students in the school, for the sake of the future of labor education and for the sake of the opportunity for future poor youth to study, vowed to fight with all their strength. They hoped that public opinion would uphold justice. The following is a record of the declaration of protecting the school issued by all the students:</p>
<p>The basic mission of the Labor University is to cultivate young people in the labor movement, train technical personnel for labor, implement the Premier's industrial plan, and establish a new foundation for labor education with the balanced development of mental and physical labor, complete the Premier's policy of agriculture and industry, and realize the main attempt of the Three People's Principles, which has long been known to society. Therefore, only by abandoning the Three People's Principles can the Labor University be closed down. On the contrary, it is the inescapable responsibility of those who are faithful to the Premier's legacy to continue to develop the Labor University regardless of any sacrifice. However, unexpectedly, our government authorities have brazenly ordered the Labor University to close down. If the reasons they hold are not intentional excuses, then they fundamentally misunderstand the meaning of the Labor University. One is that "the farm is a newly established and simply equipped, and although there are many factories, they are only suitable for training ordinary professional personnel and not suitable as a laboratory for university students." The fundamental principle of labor education lies in the balanced development of mental and physical labor. The establishment of farms and factories is to provide students with the opportunity for physical labor and to train them in corresponding labor skills. It is not like ordinary universities that specialize in academic theory and experiment. Therefore, the farms and factories that can train ordinary professional personnel are suitable, but the criticism that they are newly established and simply equipped proves that the government's responsibility is not comprehensive and cannot be used as a reason for closing down the school. The second is that "there are already national central, Zhejiang, Tongji, and Jiaotong universities in the Beijing-Hangzhou-Shanghai area, or they have established engineering colleges, or they have combined engineering and agricultural colleges." Then why should the government allow it to be established independently? The reason for its independent establishment is the same as that of the Central Military Academy and the Political School, which are training bases for personnel serving the country, so it is different from other universities in that students pay their own fees and are free of charge, and they also provide relief to poor youth in the country so that they have equal opportunities to study. Once closed down, it will not only be contrary to the government's original intention of establishing the Labor University, causing labor education in our country to be interrupted, but also lose the original intention of our students to devote themselves to the Labor University, and make it impossible for more poor youth in the future to have the opportunity to study. In addition, the impact of the war has ravaged education and increased the number of out-of-school youth. The government should be considering how to reorganize war-torn education and provide relief to out-of-school youth. Unfortunately, it has used the losses caused by the impact of the war as its main reason for suddenly closing down the Labor University, which is no different from kicking someone when they are down. Moreover, the Labor University is not the only national university that has suffered losses due to the war. Why is it so thick to some and thin to others? The intention is really not known. In short, for the sake of maintaining labor education, for the sake of relieving out-of-school youth, for the sake of realizing the Premier's industrial plan and the policy of agriculture and industry, our entire student body cannot but rise up and carry out a concerted school protection movement at this critical juncture. In addition to submitting a request to the authorities to withdraw the order to close down the school, we also hope that our compatriots throughout the country will actively assist us. This is our declaration.</p>

<p>We previously agreed to take turns providing meals. The first turn fell to Brother Chunsheng. He is working hard today, and as soon as he arrives in the countryside, he is busy preparing meals. I am fortunate enough to have a good appetite, and Brother Chunsheng insisted on pulling me along as a guest.</p>
<p>Before we set off, Mr. Zhu called the little brother aside and told him, "You usually eat meat but not skin. Today, you are a guest at a farmer's house, so you must abide by the rules and eat the skin together. It is not easy for farmers to use the money they earn from their blood and sweat to invite us to dinner. If you dislike the lean meat and pick the fat, and waste the edible things for nothing, then you will be disappointing their kindness." The little brother nodded.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Brother Chunsheng's house, we saw Old Lady Song, Secretary Li, Brother Zhao Xiaoer, and Old Man Ding were all there, and the host just filled an Eight Immortals table. Sister-in-law Chunsheng was in the kitchen preparing the food and cooking the dishes herself. Their two lovely children, Meixiang and Ying'er, were busy making tea, serving dishes, adding rice, and handing out hand towels. The dishes served tonight were four bowls and four plates. The plates were dried shreds, pickles, duck eggs, and sausages; the bowls were vegetable tofu soup, pickled carp, stewed chicken, and braised pork. We only get to eat this kind of dish once every few months in our countryside. Tonight's dishes were especially hearty and rich, served in the largest plates and bowls in the village. Mr. Zhu was prescient. The skin of the braised pork was as thick as cowhide, and each piece had black hairs sticking up like angry bristles. I watched carefully how the little brother would deal with it. I guessed that he liked to eat braised pork. If he were at home, he would surely be straightforward and politely use chopsticks to pick up a piece, put the junction of meat and skin between his front teeth, take a bite, and place the hairy skin on the table, and then leisurely chew the delicious meat. He certainly can't do this so happily tonight. He either won't eat it, or he will swallow it whole with the skin and hair. He is considering. After all, he made up his mind, picked up a piece, and blinked his eyes and sent it into his mouth.</p>
<p>First, we discussed what day to start school.</p>
<p>Students in the countryside always have to go to the school after February 2nd. Those who have already started learning can start earlier. But no matter what, you have to pick a good day. Of course, the official calendar is our only guide. Brother Chunsheng brought an official calendar and asked Mr. Zhu to pick a day. Mr. Zhu chose March 15th of the Gregorian calendar, which is February 9th of the lunar calendar. Brother Zhao Xiaoer said, "Let me see." Secretary Li said, "You don't know how to read, and the characters don't recognize you, so how can you tell if the day is good or bad." Brother Xiaoer said, "Xianggua looks at the official calendar, and a good day is a good day to the end. The day Mr. Zhu picked is excellent."</p>

<p>The Success Story of Ms. Helen Madison (3) Huai Qing</p>
<p>▲ Effort and Success</p>
<p>Although Ms. Helen's new world record in 1928 was not officially recognized, it demonstrated her amazing swimming skills. The first time she became famous was during practice when she unofficially set a new world record in the 100-meter race. This was the first time that Helen Madison's name spread to the sports news columns of newspapers around the world.</p>
<p>Helen and her coach respected each other very much. Mr. Dodd carefully guided her technique, and Ms. Helen also humbly accepted Mr. Dodd's guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. Dodd said very modestly: "Ms. Helen's success is not due to my guidance. She is a naturally gifted swimmer. In my 18 years as a swimming instructor, I have never seen anyone as respectful and attentive to her own skills as Ms. Helen."</p>
<p>"Several years ago, when she was just a child, she already had the full ability to develop her swimming. She studied swimming intently and worked hard to improve her skills."</p>
<p>Before she expects to break a record, she must stipulate a practice method. For example, for a 1,000-yard swim, she first finds out how long the pool is and how many turns she needs to make. After this problem is solved, she calculates how much speed to use from the first turn to the last round trip. Ms. Helen has done a lot of research on this point, and her time and speed are very well controlled. If she wants to break this record, she makes up her mind to study and practice three or four weeks in advance.</p>
<p>▲ Daily Life and Diet</p>
<p>Swimming is very much related to food. Indigestion will affect technique. Ms. Helen is very particular about eating and training times. She believes that the following points are important for swimmers to pay attention to: (1) Eat foods that are beneficial to the body according to your appetite, eat as much as you want, but not too much.</p>
<p>(2) Set training times.</p>
<p>(3) The movements should be natural and rhythmic, not hurried.</p>
<p>(4) Pay attention to rest and do not overwork.</p>
<p>Helen said, "I practice swimming for one hour each time, three times a week. If there is a competition, I stop practicing. If I gain weight, I do other kinds of work to try to restore it to its original state."</p>
<p>She goes to bed at 8 or 9 o'clock every night and gets up very early in the morning. For breakfast, she chooses foods rich in nutrients, such as eggs, fruits, beef, and grains. If there is a formal competition in the afternoon, she stops exercising in the morning. After breakfast, she does some slight activity to increase her physical strength. For lunch, she eats beef and solid grains. After the meal, she rests completely. If the competition is at night, she eats at 4:30 p.m., eating beef, vegetables, biscuits, cakes, and other things. Before the competition, she does not eat anything at all.</p>
<p>▲ Almost Nineteen Years Old</p>
<p>We know that Ms. Helen's success is indeed incomparable to ordinary women or men. She is a good model for athletes. She is now five feet ten inches tall and weighs one hundred and fifty-three pounds. This is the healthy and beautiful physique that swimming has given her. She will be nineteen years old on June 19th this year.</p>
<p>Ms. Helen Madison in the swimming world and Ms. Helen Wills (Mrs. Moody) in the tennis world are both angels in the world. Their great success has surprised women all over the world, and even the honor of the president's wife cannot match them.</p>
<p>Ms. Madison graduated from Lincoln High School in Seattle in June 1931. She is very interested in various sports, such as basketball, running, and tennis, but swimming is her special skill and her special hobby. Her scholarship is also very good. Her novels and art have won the praise of Seattle critics.</p>
<p>▲ Denies Engagement</p>
<p>Ms. Helen's marriage has attracted a lot of attention, but she strongly denies it. She said, "Last winter, several newspapers in New York competed to publish the news that I was engaged to someone in New York, but I myself still don't know who my fiancé is, so I want to make a special statement that I am not engaged yet."</p>
<p>The University of Washington is in Ms. Helen's hometown, but she did not go to university. Her future is to find a job after participating in this year's World Games, because her family is not wealthy, and her parents only gave birth to her, their precious daughter, so she wants to help her parents, or join the professional swimming world. Now many people are encouraging her to either become a swimming instructor or a professional swimmer. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e118">[Amber Picking Up Mustard Seeds] The Origin of Old Sayings <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Bian Hua</p>
<p>Since I published the [Original Object] talk on the 9th, I have received a letter. This letter was written by my student, Cao Zhongyuan, and I think it is very valuable, so I am publishing it:</p>
<p>Venerable Master Xiangbo: I am writing to you respectfully. For more than ten years, I have specialized in radio science. Last year, I returned to China from Europe and engaged in the manufacture of radio transceivers. In my daily reading, I only knew that the magnet was invented by the Yellow Emperor and electricity was created by Westerners. When I traveled to England the year before last, I bought a book by Ellison Hawks F·R·A·S· entitled Pioneers of Wireless in a bookstore in London. It also attributed the credit for magnetism to the Yellow Emperor. As for electricity, on page 10, it has the following record:</p>
<p>Kuopho, a Chinese physicist, wrote in the 4th century: ... yrsyy...raction of a Magnet for icon is like that of amber for the smallest grain of mustard seed. It is like a breath of wind which mysteriously penetrates through bcthand Communivsyrdiydrlgeiyhtherapidityofanarrow</p>
<p>According to the text, Guo Pu was a figure in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and the date is correct. However, the original text is from which book, there is no way to verify. Some say that [Bai Kong Liu Tie] has this record, but it was not written by Guo, nor is there such a saying. Before 128, I went to the Oriental Library to browse Guo's books, but none were available. Recently, I read the Original Object article in today's Shen Bao Free Talk.</p>
<p>The Master said: [Amber Picking Up Mustard Seeds] was discovered as early as the Han Dynasty, which is even before Guo Pu. Although this matter is small, it is quite related to academic culture.</p>
<p>The Master has read extensively and must know the origin and book title of the old saying [Amber Picking Up Mustard Seeds]. I sincerely ask you to reveal the source of this ancient saying to dispel my doubts. I am extremely grateful. Respectfully yours,</p>

<h3 id="e119">Wonderful Words to Encourage the Purchase of Homespun Cloth <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, not only has the prosperity of the city been affected, but also the lives of rural people have been greatly impacted. In the villages under the jurisdiction of Shanghai County, rural women still spin and weave homespun cloth to maintain their families during their spare time from farming. Recently, due to the extreme tightness of money, cloth shops in the surrounding villages have had trouble with their cash flow and lack money to go to the villages to buy. This has led to the situation where the cloth woven by rural women has no one to care for it, and it is almost as if they are sitting and waiting for death. Zhang Yi, the director of the Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center, in view of this situation, initiated a homespun cloth exhibition to promote it. It is scheduled for twenty days and will tour various places. Starting from the 13th of this month, it will be publicly exhibited in the Penglai Market in Nanshi for three days. Choucheng visited on the last day. There were no less than a hundred kinds of cloth on display. The patterns were mostly willow branches, squares, reed mats, and dice blocks. Although the quality is rough, it is very durable. In order to gather ideas and prepare for improvement, the association has prepared an opinion box. All the public who visit can directly state their opinions and put them in this box. Each time they arrive at a place, they will organize the opinions of the visitors and use them as reference materials. After the meeting, they will discuss them in order to adopt and improve them. The opinions seen on that day were mostly that the homespun cloth was too narrow, there were too many seams when making new clothes, and there were not many colors, so it was not as easy to catch the eye as foreign cloth. The quality is thick and durable, suitable for winter, but not for summer. It is recommended to widen the width, dye the colors so they don't fade, and use fine yarn. According to the organizers of the association, this kind of opinion is very valuable. They plan to adopt them in order and tell the farmers. Shi She, the director of the Shanghai County Education Bureau, said something very funny when reporting the motivation of this meeting. He said that the concessions in Shanghai are called "foreign fields" by the villagers. People who live in foreign fields often consider it fashionable to live in foreign houses, wear foreign clothes, speak foreign languages, and read foreign books. They regard the homespun cloth woven by the villagers as "rustic and unsophisticated," used by "country bumpkins and rustics." They don't bother to buy and use foreign goods and send foreign money to foreign countries, allowing foreigners to manufacture guns and cannons to invade China. In the eyes of foreigners, they are considered "easy targets" and not worth it. He hopes that fellow countrymen who love to use foreign goods will change their minds and buy domestic goods, and not think that they are complacent in being infected with foreign airs. Everyone laughed. Jiang Yanqiu, the chairman of the Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee, compared foreign cloth to modern women and homespun cloth to country girls. He said that although modern women look good, they may be poisonous, and you will suffer for the rest of your life after marrying them. The proverb says that country girls "have food but no looks," which is very practical. Everyone sighed that his metaphor was accurate and applauded.</p>
<h3 id="e120">A Morbid Society <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>In the statistics published in this newspaper on June 6th, let's look at the statistics on suicide and divorce: there were a total of 57 suicides, the most common cause being "family incidents," accounting for 17, followed by economic oppression, accounting for 14, and the remaining falling, unemployment, and quarrels accounting for 26. We believe that the occurrence of an incident must have a major cause, and from a "sociological" point of view, it is a matter worthy of study. We must not say that they were haunted by ghosts when we saw people "die." We should believe that under what kind of social organization is that kind of phenomenon inevitable? This is definitely not something that can be summed up in one sentence. What kind of "incident" is a so-called "family incident?" This statistical table naturally does not tell us, but we can imagine that there are 17 people who are using their various methods to find "death," which is definitely not a coincidence or a case of mental disorder. That is our, our society, should bear the greatest responsibility. As for finding death because of "economic oppression," that is not surprising given the current economic organization. Look, in which country (except for Soviet Russia) are there not many people starving and waiting to die? In this day and age, not starving and not looking for death, that's too dreamy, isn't it?</p>
<p>As for divorce, there were a total of 43 cases, and "incompatibility" accounted for 34, with the remaining accounting for 6. We naturally have to doubt the reason for this "incompatibility." Do you think that women who let their hair down and make a fuss are simply due to the two words "incompatibility?" They, I believe, have definitely buried all the difficult-to-solve disputes and put them on the four words "incompatibility." That only shows that they have found the most simple and dignified excuse for resolving the divorce.</p>
<p>Naturally, we say again, if ordinary people can not solve a certain satisfaction rooted seed when they are getting married because of their own blood spurting, what other way is there but to not look for a lawyer when everything is "exposed?"</p>
<p>However, a morbid society is always a morbid society. Kidnappings, assassinations, and robberies are not happening in our world every day? What do you want to say? The fundamental society to be created is such a society, don't you believe it?</p>
<h3 id="e121">What I Heard About A Marriage to Laugh and Cry <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Hui</p>
<p>I remember the huge cover pages of Shen Xin Liang Bao last autumn. Carrying the two film companies, Star and Great China, vying for the film adaptation rights of the novel [A Marriage to Laugh and Cry] by Zhang Henshui. The splendid and grand articles were endless. Whether they were familiar with the truth or not, the readers already knew it very well. Although half a year has passed, it is still not difficult to remember. However, there must be many who want to know the inside story. I will describe it as follows, based on what I have seen and heard.</p>
<p>▲ The novel has been published in Xinwen Bao's Happy Forest on a daily basis.</p>
<h3 id="e122">A Visit to a Soviet Russian Kindergarten <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>One day I (a reporter for the London Observer) visited a kindergarten in Moscow called the [Communist International]. It belongs to the workers of the clothing factory. There are about sixty children in the garden, aged between three and seven. Half of the expenses are borne by the factory. The parents only provide the children's food expenses. They eat bread, vegetables, and milk every day, plus some butter and sugar. Sometimes they eat apples. Every two or three days, they eat meat once. The facilities in the garden are among the best in Moscow. Many of the characteristics are very similar to kindergartens in other countries. The children are divided into several groups according to age. Every day, they play, read, and rest, all according to a very orderly timetable. They sculpt and cut paper to make pictures, build houses with small wooden blocks, and take care of flowers and plants. The older children have to manage things like meals. The three major things that the [Communist International] pays attention to are: devout belief in Leninism, active anti-religious propaganda, and emphasis on military toys and games. In one room, there is a wooden board hanging high. It was made by the children themselves. On it are written the words "How We Fulfill Lenin's Creed." Their methods of fulfilling the creed are different. Some donate money to Mopao (this is an organization to rescue imprisoned communists in other countries), some donate money to make airplanes, and some give toys to a "group." A proud little child boasted that he had removed the idol from his home. There is a rough drawing depicting the scene of removing the idol. Below it is a line of words saying. [There is no God. We don't want Jesus. We want to make our parents not believe in God either.] I asked a seven-year-old child standing next to me to explain the meaning of the painting. He said with a serious face. [There is no God. So we removed the idol. Only priests and capitalists say there is a God. Because they are the enemies of the workers and want to enslave the workers.] Then two more children came and said. [Of course there is no God. Children of foreign workers are not allowed to go to school. Because they are afraid that they will know that there is no God.] I then asked. [Do foreign children go to school?] This question stumped them. One of the children answered. [Some go to school. Some don't.] Another answered. [Rich children go.] I also saw portraits of Military Commissar Voroshilov and General Budyonny hanging on the wall. There were also many pictures of the army and navy fighting. The slightly taller group were all children aged six or seven. Their toys were all miniature war items. There were small tanks, small cannons, small rifles, small machine guns, and small armored trains on the table. There were also many wooden cannons on the floor, all made by the children themselves. Several children were running around the room with small rifles, pretending to shoot each other. I then asked a female teacher why she made the children pay so much attention to military supplies. She replied. [We are not peace activists. We usually tell the children in detail about the content of the Red Army. Teach them to love soldiers. When they grow up, they all want to be soldiers. We often take the children to visit the Red Army schools and barracks. Soldiers often come to us to play games with the children. We know that we will definitely be attacked by capitalist countries in the future. So we are always preparing for war. Only in this way can we fulfill Lenin's Creed.] When she said this, she also made an expressive gesture towards the Creed board on the wall. After I visited, I was left with a very deep impression, especially on the fact that military concepts are instilled in children from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Readers have praised it unanimously. Since Han Qiu passed away, the literary world has been silent for a long time. Getting this work with both literary and emotional beauty can be widely praised both near and far. When the whole book was finished, Sanyou Bookstore first contacted Henshui and purchased the copyright to publish it as a separate book. The sales volume was exceptionally high, setting a record. I happened to hear Li, the manager of Sanyou, tell me that it has been reprinted again and again. It has now been published in five editions. The total number of copies sold is more than 15,000, which can be said to be an unprecedented feat since the advent of social novels.</p>
<p>▲ The film company, Star, the manager Zhang Shichuan. With a clear mind. Since seeing the book published in Happy Forest, he immediately discussed it with Yan Duhuo and purchased the film adaptation rights from Henshui. After the contract was signed, he asked Yan to write the screenplay, the acts, and the description, all by hand. Yan is the chief priest of the literary world and a veteran craftsman. The adaptation is excellent. Star started filming last summer. They first made costumes and planned the scenery. They carefully considered it before starting. At that time, Star Company had spent 600,000 gold to buy a new sound and color camera. When this drama started filming, they went to Beiping to take real scenes. When the Shenyang Incident happened, the location work was just finished. They rushed back to make indoor scenes. They encountered obstacles and difficulties. It was finally completed last time. The film is more than 60,000 feet long. Two-tenths of it is with sound and two-tenths of it is with color. The rest is still a silent film. It is divided into six episodes. Sound and color are interspersed, creating a new style. The director Zhang imitated the Western film. I recently heard that he has signed a contract with the Nanjing Grand Theater. Today (the 19th), he will first invite people from all walks of life to preview the film. In less than a week, it will be officially released. The mega-hit film that everyone has been looking forward to will not be difficult to see at this time.</p>
<p>▲ Zhou Jianyun, director of the special issue distribution department of Star, and Yao Sufeng, editor of Min Bao, jointly edited the special issue of the film "A Marriage to Laugh and Cry." The preparation took five months. They have collected dozens of works from literary giants at home and abroad and printed more than 100 stills from the whole play into a huge volume using photogravure. The colors are bright and the editing is novel. It is an unprecedented work among film special issues. A total of 100,000 copies were printed. It will be released on the same day as the film is released. The audience who is fascinated by the beauty of the female stars and loves to watch the film will compete to buy it.</p>

<p>— Seeking a Happy Master</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Powerful Families Abuse Principles, but Kind Women Offer Comfort; Shortcuts and Bribes Lead to Success, and Mountain Bandits are Enlisted into the Military.</p>
<p>Councilor An had no idea. He thought I had already handled everything properly at the yamen. I went there once yesterday and realized the situation wasn't right. Only then did I realize that I had forgotten to send the gift. I can only blame myself for being negligent. It's not like I'm completely clueless. Let's just send a little more to make up for it. Originally, I wanted to put together four hundred yuan in a package, which would be presentable. You can go and tell Chief Wan plainly that Councilor An hasn't gotten a good position yet. I'm sorry, but this is all we can offer for now. If we get support from everyone in the future and there are better opportunities, we certainly won't forget them. Neither Councilor An nor I are people who would let our friends down. Mao Deshun said, "Alright. What could go wrong? I'll be right back. You two wait for my news." After Mao Shun left, in less than two hours, he returned in the car they had provided. He excitedly told the couple, "Everything is settled. Wan Jinsheng accepted the money and was very polite. He said that what happened yesterday was because he didn't know. If he had known it was you two, he definitely wouldn't have acted that way, even without talking about it. Now, the Marshal is about to receive guests, and Chief Wan is eager to meet Councilor An. Why don't I accompany Councilor An there now?" Xiaoyun thanked Mao Deshun for his trouble in running back and forth and immediately urged An Yutian to go with Mao Deshun. As they were leaving and getting into the car, she again earnestly instructed An Yutian that when he saw Old Ye today, he must present the memorial he had prepared earlier regarding the enlistment of the bandit army and ask him to approve it immediately. Fifth Mistress has also been urging him on your behalf, so there's an eighty or ninety percent chance it will be very effective. An Yutian remembered everything well and hurriedly went with Mao Deshun to that place that was like a dragon's pool and a tiger's den. However, this time, revisiting the old place, although it had only been half a day and a night, the situation was completely different. Mao Deshun acted as a temporary bodyguard, protecting An Yutian as he strode confidently towards the chief's office in the inner room of the reception hall. He took the liberty of lifting the door curtain and letting An Yutian step in first. He followed behind and announced loudly, "Chief Wan, Councilor An is here!" An Yutian entered and looked up, seeing that the chief's office was actually quite simple and unadorned. Several wooden plank beds were placed haphazardly on both sides. The walls were cluttered with pistols, military caps, leather boots, and military belts. In the middle was a square table with a large teapot, a set of ebony dominoes, several large notebooks, and countless name cards of various sizes and colors scattered everywhere. It was not much different from the scene in the gatehouse of an ordinary mansion.</p>

<p>▲Market Overview: Yesterday was Saturday, and banks had their usual afternoon holiday. Business was generally quieter than usual. The trading of silver dollars in the market was also uneventful. As a result, market prices were sluggish. However, short-term silver lending showed a slight improvement, while subsidiary coins declined. There was little new activity, and it is expected that the market will remain quiet.</p>
<p>▲Interest Rate Prices: [Silver Interest] The morning rate was 6 qian, 9 fen, and 3 li, a slight decrease of 1 li from the previous day's afternoon rate, indicating a weak foundation. The afternoon rate remained unchanged at 6 qian, 9 fen, and 3 li due to limited trading. [Short-Term Silver Lending] The morning rate opened at 1 qian, an improvement of 1 fen from the previous day. The afternoon rate retreated slightly to 9 fen. Banks quoted 4 fen, with no initial fees charged throughout the day.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small silver coins remained the same as the previous day in both morning and afternoon markets, at 6 qian, 0 fen, and 0.5 li. Trading volume was 3,500 jiao in the morning and no trading in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins were at 5 qian, 8 fen, and 9 li in the morning and 5 qian, 8 fen, and 8 li and 2 hao and 5 si in the afternoon, a decrease of 2 li from the previous day's afternoon rate, reaching a new low in recent days. Trading volume was 200,000 jiao in the morning and 55,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins rebounded to 2,000 cash, at 418,000 cash. Trading volume was over 37,000 strings.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: [Silver] Bank receipts included 1.3 to 1.4 million in Chinese merchant drafts, over 1.2 million in foreign merchant drafts, and 5.8 to 5.9 million in various goods, remittance taxes, and miscellaneous items. 700,000 was withdrawn from the warehouse. As it was Saturday, afternoon receipts were suspended, so most transactions could not be processed. Money shops and silver firms received over 22.2 million in single receipts, over 3.3 million in initial fee receipts, over 500,000 in various remittance receipts, and 400,000 to 500,000 in cash receipts. [Silver Dollars] 475,000 in draft remittances were made in the morning and 575,000 in the afternoon. 20,000 in banknotes were made in the morning and 40,000 in the afternoon. Outside the market, 90,000 in banknotes were made in the morning and 50,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions were 400,000 in the morning and 500,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions of silver dollar accounts received and issued more than 800,000, with tens of thousands of banknotes in and out. Money shops received over 4.8 million in silver dollar single receipts and over 1.5 million in silver dollar initial fee receipts. Over 1.3 million in silver dollar loans were borrowed. Small money shops traded more than 400,000, and cash flow was brisk.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Gold Price Rises Another 7 Taels, 1 Qian <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a strong upward trend, but with intermittent rises and falls, totaling a difference of 7 taels. Ultimately, the price surged by 7 taels, starting high. This was due to the sharp decline in exchange rates and the diverging trends in the silver market, with the British pound rising and the US dollar falling. Market sentiment was very firm, and the price even broke through 730 taels. Trading was very active, with various firms and short sellers chasing purchases. However, sellers from the Guangdong community were eager to sell, causing the market price to fluctuate slightly. Because foreign exchange rates were high for British currency and low for US currency, and the swap rate was small, transactions were once done at over 6 taels. As the market would be closed for the weekend, the complex and mixed situation of this week's market was reviewed. There were no special changes, and the overall condition was good. The swap rate exerted pressure from multiple sides, and short sellers were fearful, driving up the premium price and covering their positions. A certain bank's brisk cash flow resulted in the highest premium exceeding 12 taels. The minimum price for the July contract since Tuesday was 721 taels, and the maximum price on Thursday was 738 taels and 8 qian. The August contract was launched on Thursday, opening at 723 taels and 5 qian. The minimum price on the following day was 719 taels and 2 qian, and it suddenly reached 735 taels on Saturday. Within these three days, there was a fluctuation of 15 taels and 8 qian. Statistically, the opening price on the first day of the contract was up 8 taels and 3 qian. As of the 17th (the previous day), various firms had traded approximately 17,000 August contracts. The details of yesterday's market are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲High Opening Price in the First Round: The August contract opened high, up 4 taels and 1 qian, at 728 taels and 8 qian. The large contracts rebounded by one-eighth, and the silver price conversely fell by one-eighth, primarily due to the sharp decline in British and American exchange rates of 3.625 fen. Subsequently, the price decreased by 8 qian, but buyers were numerous. Bingxing, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, Yuhe, Fuxingyong, Richang, Fuyu, Hengyu, and others were all competing to buy, so the price became even sharper. The US dollar price for July silver was absorbing at 4.4375, while the British pound seemed loose. HSBC was absorbing this month at 1.875, and the gold price continued to rise by 5 or 6 taels, to 734 taels. The intraday premium was only 6 or 7 qian. At 9:20, Hengxing, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanheng, and others entered the market to sell. Furthermore, Mitsui and others offered US dollars for September at 30.75 and for August at 4.625, causing the gold price to plummet by about 3 taels, to 731 taels and 2 qian. It rebounded by a large tael in an instant. When HSBC quoted British pound prices and lowered its US dollar prices by 1.125, it was due to the narrowed exchange rate spread. At that time, the gold price was around 732 taels. Subsequently, it slightly decreased by 6 or 7 qian, to 731 taels and 3 qian.</p>
<p>▲High Point Reaches 35 Taels: Mitsui bought US dollars for future delivery at 0.0625, and Holland entered at 0.75 for September. Because Daxingyong, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Futaiheng, Hongkangyong, Yuanxingyong, Bingxing, and others were all aggressively buying, the price rose by 3 taels in a few qian, fluctuating by a tael in half an hour, reaching 35 taels at 10:10. Because August US dollars could be settled at 0.625, and Guangdong firms like Xingyifeng and Hengxinghengyou were selling, as well as Xiexingyong, Yuanheng, Qianchangfu, and others taking advantage of this to sell, and sporadic bulls were taking profits, the price retreated by 3 taels, to 731 taels and 7 qian at 10:40. In a moment, Tongtaichang, Hongkangyong, and others bought in, immediately pulling the price up by 1.5 taels, to 733 taels and 2 qian at 11:10. Yuanmaoyong and Shunlilai sold, and because Sumitomo offered August US dollars at 0.625, the price was cut by more than 2 taels, to 734 taels at 11:45. As the market was about to close, Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, and others chased their positions, so the price was able to rebound by a tael, to 731 taels and 9 qian, closing at noon at 731 taels and 8 qian, an increase of 7 taels and 1 qian from the previous day. The maximum price during the half-day was 735 taels, and the minimum was 728 taels, a fluctuation of 7 taels. The large contract increased by 13 taels.</p>
<p>▲The Official Price is Reduced by 4 Taels: The official price was changed to 803 taels. Because the US dollar quote was reduced by 1.125, to 29.875 yuan, the gold price was reduced by 73 taels to 68 taels, then to 712 taels, a reduction of 4 taels from the previous day. The book value for next month is 742 taels, and for August is 732 taels, with a supplementary water charge of 42 taels.</p>
<p>▲Short Sellers Chase Positions: According to statistics, the following Guangdong firms engaged in over-the-counter trading: Zhifengyong, Daxingyong, Bingxing, Hengyu, Fuyu, Futaiheng, Hongkangyong, Dadecheng, Yuantai, Fuxingyong, Richang, Tongtaichang, and Yuhe. Shunli and Xiexingyong sold. Tongchun, Hengxingyuan, Yuanmaoyong, Yuandayong, Fuchang, Yifengyong, and Wanxing both bought and sold. The Dalian community sold over 700 contracts and bought over 300 contracts. Guangdong firms, such as Hengxing and Yifeng, sold approximately 2,000 contracts. The remaining firms had only scattered transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Foreign Exchange: British Pound Loose, US Dollar Tight <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's divergence in the silver market, with the British pound rising and the US dollar falling, was due to the intensified decline in exchange rates, falling by more than 3 fen. HSBC's quotations fluctuated, with the British pound increasing by half a mark (1.125), to 1 shilling 7 pence and 875, while the US dollar decreased by 1.125, to 29.875 yuan. The Indian rupee increased by .75, the German mark decreased slightly by .75, the French franc decreased by 3 yuan, the Japanese yen decreased slightly by .25, the Singapore dollar fell by 1 tael, and the Hong Kong dollar remained unchanged at 77 taels and 375. The domestic market also saw the same trend, with the British pound loose and the US dollar tight. However, there were slight fluctuations in the morning and afternoon. Compared to the previous night, the British pound increased by 0.0625, and the US dollar decreased by 3.125. The gold price suddenly exceeded 730 taels, ultimately increasing by 7 taels. Bank transactions were normal, with only tens of thousands of pounds traded in British currency. HSBC bought slightly more. Approximately 500,000 to 600,000 US dollars were traded, with firms buying from each other. Chenghfengyong was reportedly short, occasionally selling gold and raising the settlement price slightly. Meifeng made an exchange of British and American currencies for September, totaling 3.629375 yuan. As the market would be closed for the weekend, the market situation this week was reviewed. Because the exchange rate spread was small, the British pound was strong and the US dollar was weak. The British pound increased by 1.875, and the US dollar decreased by 3.125 in the near term and 5.625 in the long term. Therefore, the swap rate was slightly closer than at the beginning of the week. The transaction prices of yesterday's market are described below:</p>
<p>▲British Exchange: The domestic market fluctuated by 0.0625 in half a day, with the selling price ranging from 1 shilling 8 pence 125 to 25 in the morning and the buying price ranging from 1875 to 3125. China-Belgium and Mitsui sold 1875 for June to HSBC, and Meifeng bought 375 for September (currency swap). The afternoon closing price was 1875 to 3125 for selling and 25 to 375 for buying.</p>
<p>▲US Exchange: The domestic market only had a difference of 1.125, with a swap rate of half a yuan. The opening price in the morning was 30.0375 yuan for June, 4375 for July, 5625 for August, 75 for September, and 9375 for October. The buying price ranged from 30.05 yuan to 31.0625 yuan. Mitsui bought 4375 for July, and Zhejiang sold 75 for September to Mitsui. Shanghai Meifeng and Zhongfu sold 625 for August, and Meifeng sold 8125 for September (exchange rate). Mitsui bought 0625 for November, Zhejiang and Holland traded 75 for September, and Mitsui sold 625 for August. Korea bought 4375 for July, and Sumitomo sold 625 for August. The afternoon closing price was 30.03125 yuan for June, 375 for July, 5625 for August, 6875 for September, and 8125 for October. The buying price for each month was increased by 1.125, and the official price was 1 yuan, equivalent to 3 taels 3 qian 4 fen and 728.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Large Bar Continues to Rise by 0.0625 <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The National Society, 18th, London Electric: The large bar rose again, closing at 17 pence for the near term and 17 pence and 0.0625 for the long term, an increase of 0.0625 from the previous day. The London-New York exchange rate opened at 3 yuan and 63 fen.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Bond Market Falls Into a State of Rotation <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (18th), the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange's bond market saw only a few spot transactions, totaling 16,000 yuan. Of this, the 20 Customs bonds accounted for 10,000 yuan, with the remaining bonds only accounting for 1,000 to 2,000 yuan each. The futures market also saw the same clear opening as before, totaling 3,425,000 yuan in the front and back markets. Of this, the salt tax bonds accounted for 930,000 yuan, and the 20 Customs and consolidated tax bonds each accounted for approximately 500,000 yuan. The remaining bonds were mostly in the 200,000 to 300,000 yuan range, while the complete six Customs bonds continued to be extremely clear. Regarding the trend of bond prices, the front and back markets fell into a stagnant situation, with no major changes. The fluctuation of bond prices was purely determined by the supply and demand situation in the market at the time. Therefore, the rises and falls were very chaotic. As a result, only consolidated tax spot bonds rose by 1 yuan, demobilization spot bonds fell by 7 jiao, and the complete six bonds for this month rose by 7 jiao. Other bonds were generally slightly firm, but only by 2 or 3 jiao. The bond market still showed no signs of development.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Yarn Market is Unlikely to Recover <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Only a Temporary Rotation</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is slightly flat, as the sharp decline the previous day led to profit-taking, stabilizing the market. However, the overall situation remains weak, as actual sales are stagnant, and various firms lack demand. Inventory is gradually increasing, so the bidding price of yarn may temporarily rotate. It is still difficult to be optimistic about the future. Some believe it is necessary to watch the 40-tael mark.</p>
<p>▲Retail Bids, Retail Investors Take Advantage of Short Positions: The opening price of retail bids in the morning was due to the excessive decline the previous day. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and prices rose by 3.5 qian for each month. In the second round, large firms sold, causing prices to fall. The closing price in the third round rose across the board, resulting in an increase of 3 qian for each month. In the afternoon, retail investors took advantage of short positions, causing prices to rise by 4, 5, and 6 qian for each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 20,000 bales. Gengfeng sold 2,100 bales, Rongxing sold 900 bales, Senkang sold 650 bales, and Jifeng sold 500 bales. Yiyu bought 1,350 bales, Yicheng bought 800 bales, and Changfeng bought 600 bales. The retail bid closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Retail Bid　Closing Price Increase/Decrease　Inventory　十 (October)　14,357　Rise 7　56.350</p>
<p>七月 (July)　14,457　Rise 3　19,350　十一 (November)　14,357　7　52,300</p>
<p>八月 (August)　14,396　37,350　Total　212,600</p>
<p>九月 (September)　14,358　47,250</p>
<p>▲Spot Sales Remain Stagnant: The removal of spot yarn remains sluggish. The total number of bales bought by various firms throughout the day was 426, including 200 futures contracts and 35 inter-company transactions. The market was flat. Customer firms bought 130 bales from Sichuan, 230 bales from Guangdong, 20 bales from Shantou, 20 bales from Changsha, 20 bales from Ningbo, 13 bales from the interior, 8 bales from Wuhu, 5 bales from Jiangxi, and 200 bales from Yunnan.</p>
<h3 id="e130">There Are Already Bulls in the Cotton Market <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but American cotton has turned downwards again, indicating a very bleak situation. However, general cotton merchants in this city, with its low base, are very keen to buy and go long, creating an upward trend in the market. However, considering the extremely pessimistic situation of the global cotton industry, there were previous reports of 500,000 bales of American cotton being sold on credit to China, and the arrangements were the same as for wheat. Now, news indicates that negotiations are approaching completion, and it is feared that this will become a reality. Therefore, large firms are heavily selling futures contracts. Under these circumstances, how can the cotton market support itself? In short, the global trend is treacherous, and Chinese cotton prices are uniquely high. It is difficult to predict the future, and there may be a major change.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Bid Rebounds by 3 or 4 Qian: The Zheng Bid opened flat in the morning. Although American cotton fell, market sentiment was still good. Buyers were holding tight and not moving. Near-term contracts rose by 2 qian, and far-term contracts were flat. In the afternoon, each month rose by 0.5 to 1.5 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 43,800 dan. Zonglong sold 3,600 dan, Gengfeng sold 2,000 dan, Renfeng sold 1,400 dan, and Meiji sold 1,000 dan. Changfeng bought 1,700 dan, Yiyu bought 2,900 dan, and Minghua bought 1,000 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to pest reports, but then weakened due to Wall Street's weakness and favorable forecasts from the East Coast. Futures fell by 7 to 10 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 6 to 9 points, and spot prices rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was firm due to short covering. Pingguoer rose by 2 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rose by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (17th telegram).</p>

<p>Yesterday's imported rice market was increasingly sluggish. In the morning, there were inquiries about rice from Zhenjiang and Chongming and from the local street, but there were no buyers in the afternoon. Prices continued to fall by 1 to 1.5 jiao. Small refined rice had two full inventories and its weakness was even more pronounced. 2,000 bags opened yesterday, and the price initially opened at 10 yuan and 1 jiao, then continued to fall, opening below 10 yuan, at 9 yuan, 9 jiao, and 8 fen. Saigon No. 1 also followed closely, trading 600 bags, with the price at 11 yuan and 6 jiao, and later falling to 4.5 jiao. The current total rice inventory is over 1.3 million bags, with daily sales of only 2,000 to 3,000 bags, and there are still orders arriving. The market is unusually sluggish, and it is difficult to turn around in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Selling Households Flour Prices Decline <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of yesterday's flour market in the morning, prices for each month were again showing signs of weakness. Imported quotations fell by 4, 5, and 6 jiao or more, so market sentiment was extremely depressed and the atmosphere was poor. Although major factories were in a difficult position and could no longer sell, small factories and domestic manufacturers were releasing supply slightly, so opening prices decreased. When the afternoon market opened, it initially seemed stable, but later, as selling households increased, prices for each month fell again. The reason for this decline is that actual sales are sluggish, the international atmosphere is not good, and the continued arrival of foreign wheat is likely to become a reality, so prices naturally decline, and it is not something that can be boosted in the short term. As a result, the prices for July to October each fell by 2 fen, and the price for November fell by 2 fen and 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Main Reasons for the Sluggish Bidding of Wheat <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>(1) Overseas Price Decline (2) Sluggish Flour Sales (3) New Crop Season Yesterday's futures wheat market saw mostly flat and weak prices for each month. Imported wheat quotations fell by 4, 5, and 6 jiao or more, indicating that overseas surpluses remained unchanged. Domestic flour sales also remained sluggish. This is the season for new wheat, so the difficulty in raising market prices is unavoidable. However, for near-term contracts, such as July, local merchants still intend to buy, and they buy as soon as prices fall slightly, making it difficult for prices to fall too low in the short term. In the long term, the relationship with imported wheat makes market sentiment poor. As a result, prices for July, August, and September each fell by 3 fen, and the price for October fell by 4 fen, and the price for November fell by 3 fen. New wheat transactions were still not smooth, with an opening price of 85% for An Ding wheat at 2 taels and 7 qian, and Fang Tai wheat at 2 taels and 6 qian, totaling 700 bags.</p>

<p>▲Can Be Shipped to Shanghai After the 20th</p>
<p>This year's harvest of Haikou branches is abundant, forming a reverse proportion to last year's poor harvest. According to telegraphic news yesterday, the first batch of new goods has arrived in Hong Kong, but the quantity is limited and will likely not be transferred to Shanghai. According to letters, the main batch of goods is expected to arrive here after the 20th. The first batch of cargo owners are very eager to open the price correctly, and make sure not to keep it too low, to hinder the source.</p>

<p>▲Factories Still Need to Lose Money... Transaction Expectations are Smooth</p>
<p>The local foreign firm silk market suddenly became active. Telegraphs from Lyon and other places reported that Shanghai white factory silk (Chen Silk) had been transferred to Shanghai for several days. Although the market price has risen by 50 to 60 taels, factories still need to lose 200 to 300 taels on costs, so transactions are temporarily difficult to be smooth. Yesterday, Dachang, Shenyu, Kaili, Baili, and others continued to have 85 packages of B-grade, 13-15 thread Shanghai white factory silk (Chen Silk) for sale, with the transaction price pulled to 545 taels, an increase of about 10 taels from the previous day. American firms Ganli, Lanlebi, and others also had current and future goods for negotiation, and the average</p>

<p>Since Tunchi Fine Eyebrow green tea suffered a sharp drop in price last week, the market has been exhibiting a pessimistic outlook. Various foreign firms have been hesitant to buy, fearing further price declines. This has caused extreme panic and a sluggish market. Recently, firms like Wo Ho and Kam Lung resumed trading in Tunchi Fine Eyebrow, dealing in several hundred cases, with prices dropping to ninety taels. Consequently, all types of green tea, including Fine Eyebrow and Needle Eyebrow, are declining in unison, creating a dire situation. According to well-informed sources, only collective firmness can reverse this decline. Current stockpiles of green tea in the Moroccan market are only about three to four thousand cases, a very low level. Meanwhile, the harvests of beans and wheat in that region are abundant, indicating strong future consumption. The current sluggish market is mainly attributed to the rapid price drops in the Shanghai market.</p>

<p>(Report from the Tung Foong Silk Trading Company for May of the 21st Year)</p>
<p>The silk market in May was severely impacted by a downward trend, leading to a sharp decline. Silk prices reached new record lows. A table is provided below:</p>
<p>New York Raw Silk   Yokohama Raw Silk</p>
<p>Exchange   Sayu Raw Silk  Exchange</p>

<p>May 30th 1.11  420  35.50</p>
<p>After Kan Lee bought 108,000 piculs of raw silk from the Japanese government at the end of April, the silk industry generally believed that such a large quantity of spot goods, once controlled by the government and transferred into private hands, would cause a strong reaction and that the silk market might have a stable upward trend. However, the reality was not so. In the first week of May, the American Silk Association announced that American silk mills used only 35,799 piculs of silk in April (46,761 piculs in March 1932, 41,356 piculs in April 1931). The silk market started to decline again because Japanese silk exporters were frantically dumping new silk in New York at extremely low prices (for example, Mitsui sold new silk of 20/22 denier with 85-point evenness at US$1.20 per pound (equivalent to 460 taels of silver at an exchange rate of US$31.50), and 20/22 denier with 83-point evenness at US$1.10 per pound (equivalent to 415 taels of silver at an exchange rate of US$31.50). This intensified the downward trend, coupled with the fact that new silk was approaching the market, which usually caused the market to show signs of decline. Therefore, there was no possibility of an upward trend.</p>
<p>Economic recession and the decline of various industries are another reason for the low silk prices. Taking the United States as an example, not only is there no progress, but it is also becoming increasingly tired. In this time of worldwide depression, the US government has found it difficult to maintain its fiscal budget, and the legislature is still continuing various new plans, with debates over various new bills, the struggle between expansion and contraction, which has not been resolved so far. This phenomenon only increases instability and chaos at home and abroad. As a result, businesses are cautious and have to reduce their business scope to a minimum, which is also natural. As for the current situation of the American silk industry, the silk weaving industry is more favorable. With inventories running out, factories may increase production again. In the hosiery industry, due to sluggish sales, there is also little profit. However, due to the low price of natural silk, it has fierce competition with rayon. If used for weaving cheap clothing or shirts, etc., it can almost replace rayon. Therefore, the rayon industry has been greatly affected. It is heard that several factories will temporarily close part of their work in June, and reopen when the price of natural silk is slightly higher and competition can be avoided.</p>
<p>The Lyon exchange in May was cleared and the prices were slightly lower, which was entirely manipulated by speculators. The extent of speculation by these short sellers can be illustrated by the following example. Buyers here wanted to buy factory brand 13/22 factory silk, offering 750 taels, but the factory was still unwilling to sell. However, in Lyon, someone was willing to sell it for 100 francs (equivalent to 650 taels of silver) (speculators are bearish on the market, so they sell first, and then buy back when the price falls).</p>
<p>At the end of May, silk such as San Tiao Wu Heng Jin (HY) and Yue Tu brand could be sold for 95 to 97 francs, but by the end of the month, these silks could only be sold for 80 to 82 francs. Tung Foong had a telegram saying that Yue Tu or San Tiao Wu ungraded silk was quoted as low as 71 francs (equivalent to 480 taels of silver).</p>
<p>Europe's hope for increasing silk sales is still very slim. One reason is that the European political situation is not optimistic. In particular, the German National Socialist Party has recently gained momentum, and there are fears of more political disputes in the future. Secondly, the Danube countries are practically on the verge of bankruptcy, and their economic crisis needs to be resolved urgently. The British government recently added another 20% to the existing import tax on silk fabrics, causing great panic in the Lyon and Zurich markets in Switzerland. The exports of these two places all rely on sales to the United Kingdom. As far as the raw silk market is concerned, the decline in exports to the United Kingdom has reduced exports, while on the other hand, British production will definitely increase. Since the pound fell in value, the sales of raw silk in the United Kingdom have improved slightly this year.</p>
<p>All the important reasons driving down silk prices at present have been listed above. However, from another perspective, the current situation is not as bleak as people generally think. Why? Because in the current economic panic, the prices of various raw materials are also falling, but raw silk is worse. However, the raw silk inventory in various places, including the silk that the Japanese government is preparing to export, is not enough for four months, even at the current lowest consumption rate. Although new silk will be on the market in a few months, its output is greatly reduced compared to last year, so the silk market will not decline because of it. On the contrary, the domestic silk sales volume will not only not decrease, but also have a great hope of starting to increase as autumn approaches. We can be optimistic about the harmony between the supply and demand of raw silk in the coming season.</p>
<p>The daily drop in silk prices makes silkworm farmers unprofitable, so the cocoon output decreased greatly last year, and it is feared that it will be even shorter this year.</p>
<p>Although the French silkworm industry was subsidized by the government last year, if calculated based on the total cocoon output of the country, it has decreased by 60%. The cocoon output in Italy decreased by about 30% last year. This year, the government is strongly encouraging the public to love their motherland and raise more silkworms, but as a result, the output is afraid that it will be reduced even more. Farmers in several places have even cut down mulberry trees. This year's spring cocoons in Japan are about 8% less than last year. Due to the high cost of fertilizer and the poverty of farmers, the mulberry leaves are not good. Even if the weather has no special changes, the output and quality of new cocoons will definitely not be very good. This year, the spring cocoon industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has already started weighing, the quality is very poor, and the output is about 50% to 60% less than last year. We must keep in mind that this economic crisis, no matter what its initial cause is, is not so much a credit failure as a lack of self-confidence. No matter what kind of goods, no matter how strong their statistical position is, unless the world's economic and political situation changes to the point where credit is fully restored, it is difficult for the goods to fully recover from the current decline. The quantity of raw silk shipped to American factories is attached below:</p>
<p>This year Last year March 46761 55383</p>
<p>January 58793 55910 April 35199 41356</p>
<p>February 45909 54242 May 45073</p>
<p>The American silk inventory is attached again as follows:</p>
<p>This year Last year End of March 62675 47407</p>
<p>End of January 62905 51814 End of April 57649 354 7</p>
<p>End of February 70570 45399 End of May 32688</p>
<p>The general situation of the silk industry is as described above. Recently, the Ministry of Industry, together with the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments, at the request of silk merchants, decided to exempt all taxes on the export of raw silk, and first issued treasury bonds of 2.2 million taels to subsidize the export of old silk at 100 taels per picul. Two committees for rectification and promotion were also organized to complete it. The government has done its best to rescue the silk industry, but the silk price is falling, and the dispute between the factory and the silver money industry cannot be resolved immediately. Although domestic silk factories do not buy much silk, the price is still better. However, foreign sales are still difficult. Apart from a few transactions by French firms in the monthly digest, there is no development by American firms. Therefore, to solve the problem of domestic silk inventory, it is hoped that the factory and the silver money industry will understand each other as soon as possible. If the world situation changes slightly, the silk price will immediately improve.</p>

<p>Flew to Peking Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>▲Departed from Hongqiao at 8:35 AM</p>
<p>▲Liu Chongjie and H. O. Tong accompanied them</p>
<p>▲Wang and Lo will also board the plane in Peking</p>
<p>Koo Vi-kyuin, the Chinese representative of the League of Nations Investigation Commission, came to Shanghai and has now completed his mission. Yesterday morning, he, along with Finance Minister Soong Tzu-wen and others, flew to Peking on the same Ford airplane. They departed from Hongqiao at 8:35 AM, making a brief stop in Peking to allow Executive Yuan President Wang Ching-wei and Foreign Minister Lo Wen-kan to board the plane. They are scheduled to arrive in Peiping that evening. The details of their departure from Shanghai yesterday morning are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Farewell at the Airport Those who came to Hongqiao yesterday morning to see them off included Shanghai Mayor Wu Tieh-cheng, Zhang Xianglin, General Affairs Director of the Chinese Delegation to the League of Nations, Counselor Wang Jingqi, Yang Chunruo, Madame Liu Chongjie, wife of the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Madame Soong Tzu-wen, wife of the Minister of Finance, as well as Soong’s younger siblings and their spouses, and Tzu-an, Chen Liting, the General Secretary of the Youth Association, Liu Manruo of the Guohuo Bank, Chen Xing, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, and over twenty other people.</p>
<p>▲Departure Details Yesterday morning, the well-wishers arrived at Hongqiao one after another. At 8:15 AM, Koo Vi-kyuin arrived at the airport. After getting out of the car, he exchanged brief greetings with the send-off party. Shortly after, Soong Tzu-wen also arrived with his younger siblings. At 8:30 AM, they boarded the Ford airplane together. The send-off party took off their hats to salute. Soon after, the airplane slowly taxied to the center of the airfield and took off, heading north. The time was exactly 8:35 AM.</p>
<p>▲Accompanying Personnel Those who accompanied Koo and Soong to Peking yesterday included Liu Chongjie, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the League of Nations Investigation, H. O. Tong, a Western financial advisor to the National Government, and Donald, Deng Yueming, Counselor of the Ministry of Finance, along with two Western pilots and one Chinese technician, totaling nine people.</p>
<p>▲Wang and Lo to Peking According to Koo, in a statement to a reporter from the Guowen News Agency, Executive Yuan President Wang Ching-wei and Foreign Minister Lo Wen-kan also needed to take the plane to Peking. Therefore, the plane would stop in Peking for a maximum of half an hour. He also asked what the mission of Wang and Lo to Peking was, but only answered that time was tight and he did not have time to tell the details. Later, the reporter learned that Soong will not disembark in Peking, and will go to Beiping with Wang, Luo and Koo to meet Zhang.</p>
<p>▲Reason for Meeting Zhang Wang Ching-wei and others went to Peiping together, reportedly because the Lushan Conference had concluded, and the Central Government had concrete plans for foreign affairs, finance, and military affairs, especially foreign affairs, which was very important to the relationship in the north. Cooperation and unity were necessary, and finance and military affairs were secondary. Therefore, those who accompanied Koo to Peiping this time were only the two ministers Wang, Song and Luo.</p>
<p>▲Arriving in Peiping That Evening The airplane traveled 400 li per hour and was expected to arrive in Peiping at 5:00 PM that evening. (According to Peiping's telegram, it arrived in Peiping at 3:00 PM that afternoon.) Yesterday morning, before leaving Shanghai, Koo had sent a telegram to Peiping to report. After arriving in Peiping, the plane landed in Qinghe. It was heard that other than Koo, the others would stay in Peiping for three days and then return to Peking.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Japanese Troops to Withdraw <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>from Four Areas in West and East Shanghai Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲Japanese troops in District D still have no withdrawal date</p>
<p>▲We are determined to submit it to the Joint Committee for discussion</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops west of the Soochow Creek withdrew the day before yesterday, the Japanese representative Okazaki also stated that the Japanese soldiers at the Toyoda Spinning Mill and the Toa Dobun Shoin in West Shanghai, as well as the Huafeng and Gongda Spinning Mills in East Shanghai, could withdraw today and tomorrow. However, the Japanese side argued that it had not found a suitable garrison location in the concession for the Japanese troops in District D, so it was still difficult to withdraw. The takeover committee inspected the five districts taken over the day before yesterday to discuss restoration measures. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Four Places Where Japanese Soldiers Will Withdraw The Japanese naval landing forces at the Toyoda Spinning Mill and Toa Dobun Shoin in West Shanghai, and the Gongda Spinning Mill and Wusong Huafeng Spinning Mill on Pingliang Road, each still have more than forty soldiers stationed. Yesterday morning, the Chinese and Japanese members of the joint committee had an informal meeting. At the same time, the Japanese representative Okazaki had notified Lange, the secretary of the joint committee, stating that the Japanese troops at the above-mentioned locations could all be withdrawn within days.</p>
<p>▲District D Still a Problem Regarding the Japanese troops in District D, they have been staying there for days. Although our side has negotiated with the Japanese side, we have not been able to get any results. Recently, at a meeting of the joint committee, the Japanese representative said at the meeting that the Japanese troops in District D would withdraw in the shortest possible time, because they are now looking for a suitable location in the concession as a garrison location after the Japanese troops withdraw. However, the Japanese troops have not withdrawn to this day. Yesterday, our authorities claimed that the Japanese troops were occupying the area on the pretext that they had not found a garrison location in the concession, and our side decided to submit the matter to the joint committee for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Takeover Committee <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Inspected Five Districts Yesterday</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng, chairman of the Shanghai Demilitarized Zone Takeover Committee, committee members Guo Dehua and Zhu Xibai, secretary Li Mo, and others took cars at 11:00 a.m. yesterday to inspect the recently taken-over Hongzhen and other places. They entered the Chinese territory from Gongping Road, first arriving at the Third Sub-District of the Fifth District, where section chief Wu Tingxun, special commissioner Liu Yumen, and police officers Zhou Jie and Wang Xuzan went to various places to be taken over to inspect in detail. Chairman Yin also made a speech, asking to pay attention to the public security and sanitation of the taken-over areas, especially to crack down on those who smoke and gamble, as well as petty thieves. It was also heard that many smokers had been detained in the Third Sub-District of the Fifth District, and then went to inspect the territory of the First Sub-District of the Fifth District east of the Beisichuan Road on Qiujiang Road, accompanied by section chief Ju Jing and police officer Wang Baoshu. The Fifth District and Third Sub-District suffered the most damage, and the buildings were almost completely damaged. There were only 140 intact households, and there are still more than 100 Japanese residents in the area. Next, they went to inspect the area of Shigaota Road. The area originally belonged to the First Sub-District of the Fifth District, and it is now necessary to add posts due to the situation, and in order to facilitate command, it is planned to transfer it to the Third Sub-District of the Fifth District, but it has not yet been decided. As for the situation of the Second Sub-District of the Fifth District, it is more complicated. The office has been instructed to draw a detailed map and use various colors to draw it for easy identification. They returned at 2:00 p.m.</p>

<p>▲Meeting Details At 10:45 a.m., the emcee Lu Fengzhu reported that 215 representatives had arrived, exceeding the statutory majority, and could open the meeting. After the usual ceremonies, Chairman Wang Xiaolai respectfully read the will of the Prime Minister and delivered the opening speech. Representatives Tao Baichuan of the Municipal Party Department and Mi Jifang of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau then delivered instructions. Then, the representatives of the Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau verified the names of the executive and supervisory committee members one by one, and the representatives of the Social Affairs Bureau legally drew out seven executive committee members and three supervisory committee members whose terms had expired and announced their names on the spot. Next, Chairman Wang Yansong started to discuss the proposals until 12:30 p.m. The meeting adjourned for lunch, and the meeting continued at 1:30 p.m. with elections. Chairman Wang Xiaolai checked the number of people and reported that 333 people had registered, 259 people had signed in, and 222 people were present. The members publicly elected Pan Xusheng, Gu Jiuru, Luo Liqing, and Xiang Shengwu as tellers, and Luo Qinghua, Xie Zhongfu, Zhu Wenqi, and Chen Youxue as vote counters. First, the executive committee votes were cast, and then the supervisory committee votes were cast. The voting was completed at 3:00 p.m., and while the ballot box was being opened, the discussion of the proposals continued, chaired by Chairman Xu Ji. The discussion was completed at 6:00 p.m., and the names of the elected executive and supervisory committee members were reported. The chairman delivered the closing speech, and the meeting adjourned with music.</p>
<p>▲Opening Speech Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered the opening speech at the third member representative assembly, saying, "Distinguished guests, representatives, today, this association is convened by the executive committee in accordance with Article 39, Paragraph 1 of Chapter 7 of the association's constitution, which states that the members' assembly is held regularly in mid-June every year, and Article 24 of Chapter 5, which states that the term of office of the executive committee and the supervisory committee is four years, and half of the members are re-elected every two years, and those who should be re-elected may not be re-elected, but the first re-election is determined by drawing lots. Eight executive committee members and four supervisory committee members of the first session will remain in office, and will be alternately re-elected thereafter. Candidate executive and supervisory committee members will be re-elected in full every two years, and those who are re-elected may be re-elected. After discussing the various regulations, the 92nd standing committee meeting submitted them to the 24th executive committee meeting for resolution, and convened the third member representative assembly today to discuss the proposals submitted by the members and this association, and legally held the first re-election. This is the process of convening this session of the conference in accordance with legal procedures, and it is necessary to declare it first. Today, a total of 156 members of the trade association and 30 members of the store members attended, for a total of 326 representatives, and we are honored that the competent authorities have sent personnel to attend and provide guidance, and we must express our honor. As for the situation in which this association has been in the past year, it can be said that most of the time it has been trying to cope in crisis, suspicion, shock, anxiety, and distress, so as to avoid failure. I dare to comfort myself in private, and I am barely enough to live up to the heavy trust of all members. I have selected the most important tasks of this association in this session, and I would like to present them to the conference. (1) The course of dealing with the violent takeover by the Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant [Sports Committee]. At the beginning of the Ningyue cooperation last year, the so-called Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Sports Committee suddenly appeared in this city, and its stated goal was to unify the Shanghai merchant groups. On the afternoon of November 18 last year, the committee led dozens of plainclothes people in trucks to the meeting with a fierce momentum. The leader claimed in public that he was ordered to take over, so he sent people to guard the offices of each department, the telephone switchboard, and each branch, and monitored them uniformly. This association, seeing that the matter was extraordinary, immediately convened an emergency meeting of the standing committee and resolved to petition the municipal government to send police to the meeting to maintain order, and Chairman Wang personally went to the meeting to meet with the personnel who were violently taking over and asked them who ordered them to take over, and they could not answer. Therefore, the plainclothes people were first expelled, and then sternly refuted and refused to hand over on the spot. The personnel who took over returned disappointedly. This association also believes that the committee's remarks published in the newspaper were enough to confuse the world's hearing, so this association was reorganized by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Association, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Association was ordered by the Central Political Conference to merge the four former merchant groups within a time limit. After the reorganization was completed, it was officially produced in accordance with the new Chamber of Commerce Law, and the Chamber of Commerce Law was drafted, reviewed and passed by the Legislative Yuan. All the processes were clearly stated and submitted to the government, the court, and the competent authorities for legal correction, and all the executive and supervisory committee members issued a declaration to dispel the world's doubts and correct the vision of merchants and people. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Government soon received an order from the central government to close the association, and this association was not illegally robbed. This is something that can be gratifying. (2) Regarding the Northeast Incident and the efforts to cope with the Shanghai War, since September 18 last year, the Japanese army invaded Shenyang with lightning speed and occupied the three provinces of Liaojihei in a few days. After hearing the news, this association, on the one hand, the members participated in the city's Anti-Japanese Association and worked hard, and on the other hand, repeatedly sent secret telegrams to the central government and Zhang's Appeasement Director, outlining the opinions on sending troops to rescue. Although Zhang's Appeasement Director replied by telegram that he would adopt them, he was never able to put them into practice. To this day, Shan Hei Shui is still slaughtered under the iron hooves of the Japanese army, which is painful to say. Because the Eastern Province did not resist, the violent Japanese saw China as uninhabited, and dispatched a large number of naval landing forces, and the joint fleet came to Shanghai. On the day when the municipal authorities satisfactorily answered the request, they suddenly sent troops to attack Zhabei on the night of January 28. The 19th Route Army stationed in Songhu fought bloody battles with the 5th Army to defend the country and repeatedly defeated the enemy's attack. The Japanese soldiers were discouraged, so they flew to Tokyo to transfer reinforcements, iron warships, and planes came one after another. This association believes that Songhu is an important town in the southeast, guarding the capital. If it is lost, it will affect the overall situation. It has repeatedly telegraphed the central government and the Military Commission, Chairman Chiang, and the commander-in-chief, etc., to transfer troops to rescue the situation day and night in order to ensure all-round safety. In the end, it was too late to help, and there was a general retreat of the enemy soldiers on March 2. When I think about it today, there is still pain. At the beginning of the incident, this association was in a leading position of merchants and was forced by this disaster, so it had to express something. Therefore, it immediately notified all merchants in the city to go on strike for three days to jointly resist the invaders. On the one hand, the soldiers on the front line were fighting hard against the enemy, and the goods needed for military affairs and the application of materials must be continuously supplied so that they could do their best to fight. Therefore, a donation office for relief and condolence goods was organized, and funds were raised separately. In the early stage, this association sent letters to chambers of commerce and commercial organizations in various places, sincerely soliciting donations. Therefore, the number of donations and goods sent from various places was not small. The accounts have now been announced in order to show credibility. When the League of Nations investigation team came to Shanghai, this association believed that the members of the team were entrusted by the League of Nations General Assembly to come to China, and they were responsible for a very important mission. Therefore, at the reception, the cause of the Northeast Incident and the right and wrong of all disputes between Japan and China, which the Japanese army disregarded world peace and justice, were carefully presented to the members of the investigation team, which aroused international attention. And in the English edition, the Japanese army did not declare war, and the Japanese army's pre-war and post-war expansion</p>
<p>Expansion Instructions are sent by letter immediately</p>

<p>Zhengwei Pharmacy, General Distributor</p>
<p>Various documents and books, etc., to correct international perspectives and understandings. Two aspects of this association's summary of the event deserve special mention. In addition, the routine operations of the association are compiled into monthly work reports, submitted to the Municipal Party Department and the Bureau of Social Affairs for record, and distributed to all executive and supervisory committee members for review. The reports have been completed up to December of this year and are on file. Since January, due to the sudden outbreak in Shanghai, the association's affairs have been in a state of extreme tension and cannot be handled in the usual order. Moreover, for the sake of cautious preservation, various files are stored in the bank's safe deposit box, making inspection quite troublesome. Therefore, the work reports that should have been compiled from January to this month are virtually impossible to complete. It is necessary to wait until after June, at the end of the year, to compile and report the semi-annual work situation for review. This needs to be stated as an aside, hoping for public understanding.</p>
<p>▲Resolutions Passed: The general meeting passed the following resolutions: (1) To issue a declaration expressing the association's work this year, focusing on abolishing internal warfare and promoting domestic goods. Resolved: The declaration was passed and will be issued immediately.

<p>▲Closing Remarks: The closing remarks of the members' meeting stated: "The association has only been established for two years. The year from the closing of the second session to the closing of the third session can be said to be one of the most difficult years. Not only has the economy suffered significant losses due to the Shanghai war, but the handling of affairs has also been unprecedentedly difficult. Originally, popular organizations take the social environment as their environment and the national environment as their environment. Since the country has encountered extraordinary changes and the merchants and citizens of the city have suffered a tragedy unprecedented in a century, the pain and suffering of the association in handling affairs are self-evident. What the members of the association regret most is that although they have worked day and night for the past year, without even a moment of rest, they have not made much contribution to alleviating the suffering of merchants and citizens, and they must take the blame in public. Fortunately, after the re-election, the newly elected gentlemen are all rich in knowledge and talent and will surely show new initiatives and make up for the shortcomings of the past. The purpose of this session in handling affairs is to strive for the abolition of internal warfare and the promotion of domestic goods. This matter is not only to find a way out for merchants and citizens, but also to find a way out for the country. With the Shanghai incident initially resolved, handling affairs after this may be a little smoother compared to the previous session, but the complexity of the progress and the importance of the responsibility may be ten or a hundred times greater than the previous session. In fact, these two matters may seem like clichés, but to achieve practical results, it all depends on persistence and perseverance, and doing it practically. Therefore, after the closing of this session of the assembly, it is the beginning of the association's major work. We would like to offer our encouragement and hope today."</p>
<p>▲Declarations Issued: Based on the resolutions of the general meeting, the following declarations were issued: (1) This year, the association's work should focus on abolishing internal warfare and promoting domestic goods. The Taishi Gong Biography of Merchants and Colonization states: "Agriculture produces it, industry creates it, and commerce circulates it." Therefore, agriculture and industry are the foundation of commerce. In the world, no country has merchants thriving and prospering while its rural areas are bankrupt and its industries are withering. Since China opened its ports, it has competed in the market with mechanized and scientific industries using its own closed-door handicraft industries. Like pouring soup on snow, it has suffered defeat after defeat. Therefore, the so-called wealthy merchants and big businesses of the past have all been eliminated. Those who pursue the small profits in the market have only imported goods as their means of survival, sharing the crumbs left over from foreign merchants. Therefore, those who hold opinions often say that in recent decades, China has had no commerce to speak of. The so-called merchants are merely the agents of foreign merchants. Think about it, the trade deficit increases year by year. Last year, the trade deficit even reached a staggering 500 million. How can we deny this kind of sarcastic but truly painful statement? Fellow merchants, with blood and knowledge, and patriotic thoughts, would they be willing to remain as agents of foreign merchants for a long time? I know they will surely be heartbroken and swear to deny it. Moreover, taking a step back, based on the current situation, even if they want to remain agents of foreign merchants for a long time, is it allowed by the facts? For twenty years, as a result of cyclical internal warfare, the phenomenon of many soldiers, many bandits, and many starving people has been created. Let us look at the Yangtze River basin, the Huai River basin, and the Yellow River basin, all of which were once known as wealthy and prosperous regions and markets for sales. What do they have now? Those who travel among them only see armed comrades who are half-fed, groups of bandits with fierce faces, and starving people with emaciated bodies waiting for death in the market. Even if fellow merchants have the skills to dance with long sleeves and are good at accumulating wealth, the vast majority of the common people, 99% of the country, are busy saving themselves from death, and how can they have the resources to absorb excess goods? Therefore, in view of the above situation, the association believes that the association's mission from now on must be to focus on abolishing internal warfare and promoting domestic goods to find a way out for merchants. No matter how great the resistance, the goal will remain unchanged. The reason for the current turmoil and frequent wars is that talented people want to seek material enjoyment. They either go north to the barbarians or south to Yue, engaging in political maneuvering and causing the world to disintegrate, so that they can never achieve their great desires. In short, the reason why internal warfare in our country does not cease can almost be said to be driven by a few people who want to achieve their material desires. These few people, unfortunately, are in a society where agriculture is collapsing, and they recklessly admire the consumption of industrially advanced countries, causing scholars to be uneasy as scholars and the masses to flock to the path of taking risks and seeking luck. If we can promote domestic goods as a stepping stone to revitalize industry, then all the talented people in the country will be able to gather their talents and work within the system, each using their strengths to serve society, without having to pursue wild ambitions and harm the country. Even the majority of unemployed civilians will be able to resume their old occupations without having to enlist in the army. This is especially related to the abolition of internal warfare, and those who have the ambition to conquer our country will also be able to promote the collapse of their industry, so that they may one day have a sudden realization and return our invaded land and complete our golden bowl, which may be possible to achieve. The responsibility is great, and it lies entirely on the shoulders of our merchants. We respectfully state this purpose as a replacement for words of peace." (2) Declaration opposing the establishment of a free city in Shanghai: "Since Japan occupied Shenyang on September 18 last year, it has used its military force to annex Jilin and Heilongjiang, support puppets, and plan to place the three northeastern provinces under a disguised Japanese territory. The Nine-Power Treaty of Washington, which it signed itself, has long been regarded as废纸. Therefore, recently, important figures in that country have repeatedly expressed their intention to revise the treaty, knowing full well that the United States has made a stern statement in advance, and that other friendly nations may not necessarily echo it. Therefore, they are using a two-pronged approach, first trying to involve friendly nations in the Yangtze River basin to create a situation of jointly undermining the Nine-Power Treaty, so that when Japan proposes a revision of the treaty, it can hopefully achieve its goals smoothly. We cannot help but admire their ruthless methods and careful planning. What is their plan? It is the Shanghai Free City that has been making a lot of noise recently. If we analyze the Shanghai Free City proposed by the Japanese, it is nothing more than the transformation of the dictatorial South Manchuria Railway Company into a South Manchuria Railway Company with international joint organization, adding a non-Chinese, non-horse disguised independent country within the Chinese territory, so that in addition to the Manchuria country monopolized by Japan, there is also a Shanghai Free City monopolized by the international community, facing each other from afar. Then Japan's monopolization of the Northeast and the revision of the Nine-Power Treaty can be justified and not afraid of foreign refutation. Therefore, the current Shanghai Free City under consideration is different from the Manchuria country supported by Japan in terms of size and scope, but in terms of hindering China's territorial integrity and sovereignty, the nature of the two cases is equally serious and there is no difference between them. For the sake of survival and self-defense, China cannot tolerate the breaking of the Nine-Power Treaty, allowing the Japanese to sit back and enjoy the situation they have created in the three northeastern provinces. The friendly nations that convened the Washington Conference and the friendly nations that jointly signed the treaty also all regarded the treaty as a lifeline for maintaining the balance of power in the Far East and eliminating world disputes. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has long regarded the treaty as a thorn in its side and will never want to be fooled by the Japanese again, helping them to create a situation of adding wings to a tiger. Not only that, but foreign businessmen in China have a shallower political relationship and a deeper commercial relationship, and they may not feel that there is a great need to uphold the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, the association dares to state here that foreign merchants doing business in China deeply welcome the principle of open doors, but they should know that the foundation of open doors must be built on the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, so that the opening can be practical. Taking the current situation in the three northeastern provinces as an example, the Japanese have repeatedly stated to foreign businessmen that their doors are open, but China's territorial sovereignty has been deprived by them, and the commerce of foreign businessmen in the area has also plummeted, deeply feeling the oppression. If foreign merchants take their own interests into account, is it better to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty and respect China's sovereignty, or to help the Japanese with their mistakes and undermine China's sovereignty? Don't say that the situation in Shanghai is different from that in the three northeastern provinces. If the proposal for a free city becomes a reality, all countries can share a piece of the pie, but they should know that Japan, with its proximity, the similarity of the customs of the two peoples, and the ease of transferring factories, is easy to gain an advantage in everything. In recent years, Japan's import trade in Shanghai has been rising sharply, almost taking the top spot from the United Kingdom, and other countries are even further behind. As for the power established in the concessions, it is even more deeply rooted and growing year by year. As evidenced by the Songhu War, the Japanese military's unique freedom of movement in the concessions has almost taken the place of the painstaking efforts of the United Kingdom and the United States over the past few decades. If the Shanghai Free City is established, it will only increase Japan's power, making it a second Qingdao and a second Dalian. As the saying goes, "Gathering hundreds of flowers to make honey, for whom are you working so hard?" Why are our friendly foreign merchants still not aware of this? Therefore, the association respectfully makes the following declaration based on the resolution of the members' meeting: (1) The Japanese proposal for a Shanghai Free City is a strategy to involve friendly nations in jointly undermining the Nine-Power Treaty. The association vows to lead the merchants and citizens of the city and resolutely oppose it. (2) This proposal will surely create an opportunity for the Japanese to monopolize the Southern industry in Shanghai and weaken the commercial position of friendly nations in China. For the sake of benefiting others and ourselves, we should wake up and make the same determination to oppose it as Chinese merchants. (3) Japan has many advantages in its commerce with China, but at the same time, it also has indelible weaknesses that foreign merchants must not ignore. As a result of Japan's historical aggression against China, its relationship has been severely damaged. Therefore, the country is trying to involve foreign merchants in a vortex, so that the Chinese people will treat all countries with the same mentality as they treat Japan. This will naturally eliminate the country's commercial weaknesses. We hope that foreign merchants can see through this point and cooperate with Chinese merchants." (3) Declaration opposing the opium monopoly: "The minimum duty of a government that stands in the world is to ensure that its people have the food necessary to sustain their lives. For the past ten years, the military has forced civilians to grow opium, and this has become an open government policy. Selling opium specially and collecting special taxes has become a common plan for raising military funds. Recalling the beginning of the Republic of China, in provinces such as Hunan and Zhejiang, those who planted even a few opium seedlings in their fields were executed. The ban on opium has been relaxed and tightened, like the difference between heaven and hell, and one cannot help but feel as if they are in another world. In recent years, the Northwest has suffered severe droughts for several years in a row, and tens of thousands of people have starved to death, roughly equal to the population of a medium-sized European country, which is unprecedented in history. Even Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," which used to supply other provinces with surplus grain, has recently been plagued by famine. Civilian silver and grain, and even more so the juncture of Yu and Anhui, starving people filled the roads, and people were sold in the market. There is no need to discuss the reasons for these disasters, which are due to planting poisonous weeds and uprooting good crops. There has been a lack of storage in peacetime, resulting in the people being helpless in the face of lean years. Therefore, in recent years, starving people have spread across the country, thanks to the promotion of opium cultivation by the military. To be frank, our country has long been publicly planting and selling opium, but the so-called public sale is only a semi-official public sale by local governments. However, it has already led to the current situation of starving people and bandits everywhere. Although the government has worked hard day and night, it has no way to clean up this rotten situation. If the public sale by local governments is expanded to a public sale by the central government, the whole country will fall into darkness, resulting in no qualified young men available in wartime and no sufficient food to support themselves in peacetime. In the event of repeated years of famine and an international emergency, the seaports are blocked and the import of foreign grain is cut off, what other way is there to save ourselves except to starve to death? The whole nation will not perish from foreign aggression, but from opium, which is to be expected. People and gentlemen of the country, do not say that this is an oversensitive statement by the agency. If you think about the great disaster of last year, what the starving people relied on to survive was a large amount of American wheat lent on credit. The international situation is constantly changing. Begging for food is not a long-term solution. As a result of the opium monopoly, the areas where opium is forced to be planted will inevitably expand even further than they are today. The military's reliance on opium as the lifeline for raising military funds will also become even closer. Taking the establishment of likin during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods as an example, once in it, the more one sinks, the deeper one gets. The authorities will inevitably drink poison willingly and enjoy it tirelessly. Therefore, in the recent facts of the new epidemic, there are even places where new water conservancy projects are being built, not encouraging people to plant rice but ordering people to plant opium. Such a retrograde act is lamented by both Chinese and foreigners. This is the phenomenon of starving people and bandits everywhere in our country today. If this state continues for another three to five years, it will not only lead to the destruction of the country and the extinction of the race. Since we have proved that the recent famine and public opium planting are causally related, then prohibiting the secret opium monopoly is a necessary requirement for the people to maintain their lives and the minimum duty of the government to protect the food supply for all. If there are fallacies such as controlling it by levying taxes to confuse the public and recklessly hope to open up a shortcut to raise funds, then this kind of strategy is only applied by the British, Dutch, and Japanese to their colonies. Even the dying Qing government at the end of the Xuantong period was unwilling to do this. If such rumors become a reality, the association will definitely follow the people of the whole country and strive to oppose it. Therefore, we publish the above declaration based on the resolution of the conference and the general meeting, and all our compatriots should take note of it."</p>

<p>Central Committee Member Li Liejun's Telegram, Please circulate to all newspapers: I recently sent a telegram to President Wang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, which read: President Wang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, Greetings. For several months, my health has deteriorated, and I have been unable to assist in major political affairs. However, the country is declining, and the people are in turmoil. How can I not be concerned? I merely remember that during my time in the central government, my proposals to respect civil rights and implement a national political system were unlikely to be adopted. I feared that future generations would view the present as we view the past, so I remained silent. Now, reading your telegram, I understand your great aspirations to consider the people of the whole country, lamenting the pressure of foreign aggression, the destruction of our territory, and your desire to dedicate your life to national crisis for a long time. However, natural human rights are being deprived. Even when expressing opinions or writing, one may be blamed. Participating in politics and taking responsibility is even less likely. How can the people recognize the government as an organization suitable for a democratic country, or view the government's measures as embodying the spirit of democracy? Putting myself in their place, could I remain silent? If we want the entire nation to unite against foreign aggression, we must first ensure that the people have a unified way to participate in politics. Moreover, the First and Second Plenary Sessions already had resolutions to protect the people's freedom, yet they cannot be earnestly implemented. What hope can we have now? I recall that our party has been in power for several years. In the past, power was in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek, and today power rests with you, sir. The responsibility of the former was smaller, but the responsibility of the latter is truly great. Our party members often say that it is difficult to lead the nation to peace and prosperity, but in reality, the difficulty lies not in the measures, but in sincerity. The Book says, "The people can be approached, but not looked down upon." Sun Yat-sen said, "Government of the people, by the people, for the people." The affairs of the nation have reached this point, we can reverse course and plan anew. Reading the telegram has moved me, and I offer my humble opinion, hoping that you, sir, will support the precarious situation and uphold the country. Li Liejun, etc., I respectfully report, Li Liejun.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Liu Manqing's Whereabouts After Leaving Shanghai <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Liu Manqing, a special commissioner appointed by the National Government to investigate the Kang-Tibet dispute, came to Shanghai to report everything to various sectors after going to Nanjing to meet with members of the Central Committee and report on the truth of the Kang-Tibet dispute. It is now known that after leaving Shanghai, Ms. Liu arrived in Hong Kong on the 15th of this month, changed to the Qiongzhou Wheel, entered Yunnan via Annam, and transferred to Kang-Tibet. However, according to Zhu Qiong, Ms. Liu's representative in Nanjing, some generals in Sichuan have falsely accused Ms. Liu of impersonating a commissioner and colluding with the Dalai Lama. Ms. Liu has formally submitted a request to the central government for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Various Sectors Firmly <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Oppose Rent Concession Telephone Price Increase</p>
<p>▲ Organize User Federation to Cope With</p>
<p>Since the Rent Concession Telephone Company's price increase was approved by the Municipal Council, various groups in the city have expressed firm opposition and demanded that the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council strive to cancel it. Yesterday, the Citizens' Federation held an emergency meeting on this matter to discuss countermeasures. It was immediately decided to organize a user federation to fight the company collectively. According to a standing committee member of the City Federation speaking to a reporter from the Guomin News Agency, this telephone price increase disregards the burden on users, and the increase for shops is as high as 34.6%. In the past, it only cost 19.5 taels of silver per quarter, but now it will increase to 26.25 taels of silver. Even residential areas will increase by 25%, from 13 taels of silver to 16.25 taels of silver. The most unacceptable thing is that the new price must be calculated from March 27th of this year. When paying the telephone bill for this quarter, users must also make up for the shortfall from the previous quarter. Therefore, no matter what, users must unite and firmly oppose it until the goal of suspending the price increase is achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e153">All Yangtze River Chinese Steamers Conscripted <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>To Transport Large Army to Suppress Communists</p>
<p>▲ Wuxue is Extremely Critical</p>
<p>▲ Shangguan Division Ordered to Enter Jiangxi</p>
<p>▲ Merchant Ships Limited to Two Days Arrival</p>
<p>▲ Almost No Chinese Ships on the Yangtze River</p>
<p>The forces of the communist bandits have spread throughout the Yangtze River. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, personally went upstream to supervise the various armies in suppressing the bandits. He specially convened a meeting of military generals in Lushan to discuss bandit suppression, deciding to mobilize a large army to first clear the traces of bandits in Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces. It is estimated that 15 divisions of troops will be mobilized. Recently, due to the fall of Guangji and the emergency in Wuxue and Luotian, a special telegram was sent to Shanghai to requisition a large number of Yangtze River ships to transport bandit suppression troops. From today onwards, the Yangtze River ships of Chinese merchants in Shanghai will all be suspended. The reporter's investigation is divided into the following summary:</p>
<p>▲ Bandit Alert Along the Yangtze River. Northern Anhui, such as Susong, Taihu, Qianshan, Yingshan, and other places, have been occupied by the communist bandit Kuang Jixun's troops. Huangmei and Guangji have been captured by Gong Bingyan, Li Can and other groups. Residents have fled to Jiujiang and Wuxue. According to refugees who fled to Shanghai by Yangtze River steamer yesterday, Guangji was occupied by the Red Army on the 11th. Due to the mutiny of the garrison troops in Luotian and Qishui, the people are even more panic-stricken, with several alarms every night. The inland areas within 80 miles along the Yangtze River in Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei have almost become bandit areas. Qichun is even more critical. Inland traffic upstream has almost been blocked by the Red Army. In recent days, refugees fleeing to Shanghai have been extremely crowded.</p>
<p>▲ Large-Scale Mobilization. The bandit suppression troops for this Lushan Conference have been designated to be divided into four routes in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan. In northern Anhui, Wang Jun's Seventh Division, Xu Yaoting's Fifth Division, and Yue Shengxian's 46th Division will advance from Anqing, Hefei, and other places, while Hu Zongnan's division will provide support. In Luotian and other places in Hubei Province, Zhang Yinxiang's 31st Division and Ge Yunlong's 33rd Division will be transferred. Ma Hongkui's 35th Division and Guo Rutong's 26th Division will be ordered to garrison Xinyang and cooperate in the attack. Other divisions such as Dai Minquan, Huang Lie, and Cao Wanzhong are also being mobilized.</p>
<p>▲ Troops Transferred to Wuxue. Wuxue is an important place upstream and a must-pass for Yangtze River steamers. Due to the fall of Guangji this time, Wuxue is extremely tense. Chairman Chiang urgently ordered Shangguan Yunxiang's 47th Division, which went south during the anti-Japanese war, to expedite its departure to Jiangxi to rescue Wuxue. After withdrawing from Kunshan, Shangguan's troops were stationed in Changshu. Yesterday, they were ordered to depart for Nanjing and Zhenjiang, and to go west by steamer overnight directly to Jiujiang and Wuxue to suppress the Red Army in Guangji.</p>
<p>▲ Yangtze River Ships Requisitioned. Yesterday, Chiang ordered the Ministry of Military Affairs to requisition all Yangtze River steamers from the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanpei, and Ning Shao companies, ordering them to go to Nanjing and Zhenjiang to await dispatch for troop transport. After receiving the order, the three companies temporarily cancelled the scheduled commercial sailings of the various Yangtze River steamers and ordered them to rush to load coal overnight. This morning, more than ten ships, including Jianghua, Ningjing, and Changxing, rushed to Zhenjiang and Nanjing to transport troops west.</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Merchant Ships All Suspended. The Chinese Yangtze River steamers of the three companies were suspended for a long time during the Shanghai war. They had only recently resumed operations when they suddenly received the order to be requisitioned. Yesterday, the ships that had been scheduled to go to Nanjing included Jiangda, Jiangyu, Jiangtian, Jianguo, Jiangxin, Jianghua, Changan, Dexing, Fengpu, Fulong, Ningjing, and others. Four small Yangtze River steamers from the Tongyang route were also dispatched. At that time, it was planned to transfer all Chinese ships on the Yangtze River. After repeated consultations among the three companies, Jiang'an, Jiangshun, and Ning Shao were kept to maintain commercial services and facilitate transportation. As for the ocean-going ships that should be requisitioned, there are also Tonghua, Gongping, Yushun, Taishun, Wanxiang, Hua'an, and Xin Ningxing. The Chinese ships on the Yangtze River and sea routes that remain in operation in Shanghai account for only one-tenth of the total.</p>
<h3 id="e154">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Salary Increase for Engine Department</p>
<p>▲ Company is Considering Improving Treatment</p>
<p>▲ Qualifications and Status Must Also Be Defined</p>
<p>The wages of the staff of the engine departments of various merchant ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were very high during the era of employing foreign engineers. Since the change to Chinese employees, wages have suddenly been reduced. The Engine Association submitted conditions and requested the general manager to improve treatment and increase wages. The latest news investigated is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Company's Statement. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited General Manager Li Weihou yesterday. According to him, the personnel of the engine department were originally all foreign. In order to recover rights and interests, Chinese personnel were gradually used, mostly coppersmiths and other promoted staff, and their wages were roughly the same as those of Chinese employees in other companies. The case of improving treatment has now been investigated and is being considered. Within the possible scope, and to the extent that the company's financial resources can afford, detailed measures will be reviewed and appropriate increases will be made.</p>
<p>▲ Salary Increase Amount. The General Federation of Engineers requested an increase in salary. According to the statement yesterday, the requested salary amount is: (1) Chief Engineer, originally 160 yuan, please add 20 yuan to 180 yuan, and gradually increase to 300 yuan in the future. (2) First Assistant Engineer, original salary 120 yuan, now please add 10 yuan to 130 yuan, and increase to 180 yuan in the future. (3) Second Assistant Engineer, original salary 80 yuan, add 10 yuan to 90 yuan, and increase to 140 yuan in the future. (4) Third Assistant Engineer, original salary 60 yuan, please add 10 yuan to 70 yuan, and increase to 100 yuan in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Define Qualifications. According to Wang Tong, Chief of the Shipping Department of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the company has no regulations regarding the qualifications and status of engineers. The company is currently discussing the engineers' request for a salary increase, but the general manager has not yet made a statement. However, the shipping department is planning to stipulate the qualifications and status of engineers. Roughly, the position of chief engineer is equal to that of the shipowner's representative, above the first mate. With qualifications defined, there will be a procedure for wages, and the responsibilities of those who hold this position can also be clearly defined.</p>
<p>▲ Recruitment. The six engineering trainees recruited by the company this time have been announced. They are Lu Jingyun, Di Zhaolin, Xu Wei, Lu Zhongxun, Wu Bangyan, and Li Wenchang. A notice was issued yesterday ordering them to report to the company immediately and await assignment to various ships for internships. There is also Zhu Yafang, whose French test paper still needs to be re-examined with an oral examination. These members will be reported by the company to the Maritime Administration Bureau for record. According to Zhou Houkun, the examiner, a second batch of trainees is planned to be recruited.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Murderer Commits Suicide <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>▲ Hengsheng Commits Suicide in Fear of Punishment Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>▲ Heim Can Rest in Peace Underground</p>
<p>The case of the murder of a fellow Westerner in the western Shanghai Lincoln Road, near Warren Road, on the morning of the 17th (the day before yesterday), has been detailed in yesterday's newspaper. However, after the incident, the police quickly and completely investigated the surnames, origins, and professions of the deceased and the murderer. The body of the deceased was examined by the US Assessor's Office yesterday morning, and the US Consulate and the police strictly searched for the murderer. Unexpectedly, the murderer, knowing that he could not escape the law, committed suicide with a gunshot in a Russian apartment at 471 Lafayette Road in the French Concession yesterday morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Deceased Was Only Son. The only eyewitness to the tragedy was Zhao Zhiliang, a Yongbo driver from the United Automobile Company. Therefore, after Zhao reported to the police, the police chief sent personnel to find the body with Zhao Zhiliang. After investigation, it was learned that the deceased was named Heim R.K. Heim, and the murderer was named Hengsheng T.M. Hansen. Both were American citizens. The deceased was only 23 years old and was an only son. His parents are alive and currently live in the United States. He came to China 18 months ago and initially worked for the Meifu Petroleum Company in Tianjin. He came to Shanghai last winter and later joined Puyi Bank. He had just resigned at the beginning of this week and was living in the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>▲ Murderer Passing Through Shanghai on Way Back to America. The murderer, Hengsheng, came to China in 1927 and served as a third-class pharmacist in the US Navy. The following year, he transferred to the Meifeng Bank and was soon transferred to the Tianjin branch to work. This time, he was on his way back to the United States via Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and stayed at the Duchen Hotel on Sima Road. He was originally scheduled to return to the United States on the President Garfield steamer yesterday morning. It is unknown how the tragedy of assassinating Heim occurred.</p>
<p>▲ US Assessor Examined. Yesterday morning, Kreissel, a magistrate from the US Assessor's Office, along with six jurors, swore an oath at the Assessor's Office and then went with the magistrate and prosecutor to the International Funeral Home. First, they inspected the body of Heim. Dr. Langxi, who had examined the body yesterday, pointed out the bullet wounds. One bullet entered from the upper left thigh and exited from the right chest. One bullet entered from the base of the skull behind the head and exited from the head above the right eye. Both were fatal. They then examined the bloody coat worn by the deceased and went to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station to interrogate the driver about the assassination situation at that time.</p>
<p>▲ Driver's Eyewitness Account. According to the driver's testimony, he picked up two Westerners at 11:40 yesterday morning. He recognized one of them as an old customer. When the car reached the west of the concession, it traveled south along Lincoln Road. Suddenly, he heard an explosion. At this time, he was driving, and the deceased was sitting on his left. Another Westerner was leaning on the gasoline tank, facing Heim and him. His left hand was holding the gasoline tank, and his right hand was hidden in his raincoat. Before the explosion, the Westerner had told him and Heim to look up at something in the direction of the Brahma King Ferry. When the explosion occurred, he looked back and saw that Heim had fallen on the seat. Previously, the two Westerners had been talking, seemingly friendly and without any grudges. He also did not see a pistol. Afterwards, the other Westerner ordered him to stop the car and asked him to help move Heim's body to the back of the car, saying that he was sick and needed to be taken to the hospital. After moving the body, he returned to his seat and drove. But when he occasionally looked back, he saw the Westerner standing in the car, and the body was gone. When he drove near Warren Road Bridge, the Westerner got out of the car and left. He then drove back to report to the car company and relayed the information to the police station.</p>
<p>▲ Murderer Rented Apartment. After assassinating Heim and fleeing, Heng knew that the police and the US Consulate would definitely be searching everywhere. Since he was an American, he knew that he could not escape the law. He then had the idea of committing suicide. Heng went to the Russian apartment at 471 Lafayette Road in the French Concession alone at around 3:00 pm the day before yesterday, rented a room on the east end of the second floor, and agreed on a monthly rent of 40 yuan. After entering the room, he showed a tired state and ordered the waiter to bring him a glass of cold water. He then closed the door and went to bed. No one saw him again after that.</p>
<p>▲ Committed Suicide with a Gun in Fear of Punishment. At around 8:00 am yesterday morning, a faint groan suddenly came from Heng's bedroom. The boarders in the next room knew something was wrong and told the waiter. The waiter knocked on the door but received no response. He then peeked in through the window gap above the door and saw that Heng had fallen on the bed, his left wrist artery had been cut, and blood was flowing all over the bed. The waiter was horrified and reported to the owner, who relayed the information to the French police station. By the time the detectives arrived, Heng had already shot himself in the forehead and committed suicide. A bottle of poison was also found in his room, which was probably also a tool he used to commit suicide.</p>
<p>▲ US Consulate Sent Personnel to Identify the Body. The French police station initially could not determine the cause of his suicide. After investigation, they learned that he was the murderer in the Heim assassination case and committed suicide in fear of punishment. They immediately notified the Public Concession Police Station, which relayed the information to the US Consulate. Personnel were immediately dispatched to confirm the identity. The body is awaiting examination tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Pawnshop Owner's Son <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Chops and Kills Two Shop Employees</p>
<p>▲ Owner's Son Keeps Company with Thugs</p>
<p>▲ Perpetrator Acts Viciously after Failed Extortion</p>
<p>▲ Three Perpetrators Total</p>
<p>▲ Steals Jewelry and Cash before Leaving</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 2:00 PM, three people suddenly came to the Qingfu Pawnshop, number 2649 Yangshupu Road, across from the power plant. They shut the main entrance, and ran into the shop, demanding money from the shop employee, a Mr. Li Guan-nan, who was from Luo Dian. One of them was the pawnshop owner's son. Li attempted to escape through the back door, seeking to find the boss. However, he was grabbed, his chest clothing yanked on, and for no reason, a dagger was pulled out and swung down for seven strikes, one on the throat and one on the abdomen. The scene was covered with blood, and he expired soon after. Another employee, a Mr. Jiang Zhen-Fang of Guangdong, aged twenty-three, tried to persuade those attacking. However, under the owner's son's rage, he was stabbed multiple times, and soon dropped dead due to his injuries. The three took two jewelry boxes from the counter, and paper currency amounting to about two hundred twenty yuan, before escaping through the back door. A young apprentice returned later and saw that the front door was shut tight. Going through the back door, the two corpses were found covered in blood. He cried out, and called neighbors to come. Local police number 2078, and the local patrol, were notified. After investigating, the police determined that the attacker was the owner's son. Since his youth he never pursued an honorable path, indulging in recreational pursuits. His father had repeatedly cautioned him without effect. Last year his father placed an advertisement severing their relationship. Living like a derelict, he ran with hoodlums, and when his finances ran low, he would try to use the pawnshop. This happened monthly, and due to his father's heavy opium addiction, he was bedridden, and all tasks were handed to Li Guan-nan. Li, not tolerating these disturbances, had reported the behavior to the owner, and instructed Li to ignore his son's presence. Because of these actions he grew to hate Li. Therefore, the attack was for revenge. The police are chasing those involved.</p>

After searching his pockets, twenty-seven copper coins were located, as well as three cards. One contained the name Huang Yin-kang, and that he was from Yuyao in Zhejiang. Another contained the address of the Wan Chun Sauce Garden next to the Ren Xing Yarn Factory near the Guang Xin docks near the Yang Pu River. The card was used to establish location in case there were no relatives. The reasons behind the suicide are being investigated.</p>

It is found that the capitalists had a surplus of more than 320,000 yuan last year (see the business report for the 20th year of the Republic). Please make a clear distinction and order the factory to resume production quickly, and do not be deceived.

<p>Fire Fighting Work in May</p>
<p>The Fire Brigade of the Public Works Department reported that it received 46 calls this month, including 9 false alarms, 2 false reports, and 4 special calls.

<h3 id="e165">Dispute Over Soda and Stamp Tax <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter Requesting a Refund</p>
<p>▲ The Stamp Tax Bureau Provided a Detailed Explanation</p>
<p>▲ Official Letter from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Tobacco Exchange Guild: On the 13th of this month, a public letter from the Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau stated: "Regarding your association's letter No. 568, which included a letter from the Tobacco Exchange Guild stating that Shen Wancheng and Chen Defeng, tobacco exchanges, successively reported being inspected by stamp tax bureau inspectors for selling soda without stamps, identified as tax evasion, and detained to the bureau, etc. The soda is manufactured by factories, and the stamp tax should be collected from the factories. The stores are retailers and have no responsibility to bear the stamp duty. Please uphold justice and alleviate the difficulties of merchants, and write to the tax bureau to return the detained goods first, and clearly stipulate that the factory is responsible for the stamp duty, and announce it to the public, etc. The stamp duty for soda is a special stamp tax, which is a tax on goods, similar to the stamp duty for cigarettes. The responsibility for paying taxes should be on the manufacturers, not the shops. The request of the guild to return the goods detained from the two stores and clearly stipulate the responsibility for stamping is a legitimate request. Please investigate and handle it separately according to the regulations that factories should affix stamps at the factory, and return the detained goods, etc." The Bureau investigates that the soda stamp tax was ordered to continue in April of this year. The Bureau immediately checked the previous year's case and notified the soda industry guild through your association that the factories should affix stamps at the factory to pay taxes and strengthen tax revenue. At the same time, the Bureau notified all factories to affix stamps on all soda leaving the factory and to avoid any omissions that would lead to inspection and detention. In April, a bulletin was widely distributed and posted in public places. The Bureau clearly stated in letters and announcements that the soda stamp tax should be borne by the factory. This is not difficult to review. However, due to the relationship of the Shanghai Concession, there are special circumstances. The soda factories in the Concession may not consistently comply with the method of affixing stamps at the factory, or there may be omissions in the procedures. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to inspection. Therefore, in addition to investigating whether there is tax evasion when transporting soda at the junction of the Chinese and Concession areas, the soda shops must also be inspected to investigate whether the factory is implementing the stamping. This is the Bureau's responsibility for collecting taxes and must pay attention to inspection. Now, according to the previous reason, the soda detained from the two tobacco exchange stores, Shen Wancheng and Chen Defeng, has been approved by your association to be returned. In order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the Bureau can do so. You should transfer the letter to the Tobacco Exchange Guild and inform the two stores to come to the Bureau to claim it. As for the guild's request to clearly stipulate the responsibility for stamping, the Bureau has notified the soda manufacturers in the Chinese and Concession areas of the method of affixing stamps at the factory, and in April of this year, it sent a letter to your association to inform the soda industry guild to notify all manufacturers to comply. The responsibility for soda stamps has been clearly assigned to the factory. Since it has been stated again and again, there is no need to stipulate it again. I have always admired your association's leadership of the merchants, and the public's opinions are in agreement. If you consider the relationship of national taxes and notify the soda industry manufacturers of the Bureau's original letter in April of this year and persuade them again, it will be seen that borrowing your words will surely lead to a clear effect in the method of affixing stamps at the factory in the future. At the same time, write to the Tobacco Exchange Guild to urge all tobacco exchange stores to pay attention to whether there are any missing stamps when purchasing soda in the future. If there are any unstamped, they must affix stamps on each bottle before selling it. When purchasing goods, do not mistakenly purchase unstamped soda, causing disputes. If this is handled, it will be possible to promote each other on both sides, and both national taxes and commercial conditions will surely benefit more, etc. The guild heard that the guild is firmly opposed to the tax bureau's method of requiring shops to affix stamps on each bottle, and plans to telegraph the head office to request instructions, and plans to send personnel to warn the industry to stop selling, fearing that it will cause a huge turmoil, following the Tianjin's armed resistance.</p>
<p>▲ Discussion: Since Liu Qingzeng, the director of the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau, took office, he has been making great efforts to rectify tax collection and seek truth from facts. Regarding the soda stamp tax, he believes that the tax revenue should also improve during the current peak season for soda sales. In order to prevent tax evasion, he invited representatives from various soda factories and companies to consult in detail and discuss it. In view of the established cases, there have been regulations for the soda industry to pay taxes and affix stamps for a long time. He hopes that each company will fulfill its responsibilities in accordance with the regulations to help the process. The representatives were clear about the facts and were willing to comply with the regulations and pay taxes to operate. However, they claimed that when soda is transported to other cities, merchants in each place believe that the soda is sold in a certain place and must use the stamps of that place. There is no need to use the stamps of the place of origin. Director Liu explained to them that the stamp is a national tax. Since there is Shangbao stamp, it is valid for inspection anywhere, and it is not subject to re-taxation. If any omissions are found, the local stamp tax bureau should order it to be supplemented locally. This is the established method. Merchants in other cities may not be fully aware of this misunderstanding. I hope to explain it at any time to dispel doubts. Each representative expressed their willingness to comply after this negotiation.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Robbery on Ximen Road <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Stolen Goods Were Taken to the Roof to Escape</p>
<p>▲ Detectives Conducted a Large-Scale Search with No Results</p>
<p>▲ The Entrance of Run'an Lane Was Like Facing a Formidable Enemy</p>
<p>Yang Junmu, a resident of a single-room shikumen house at No. 90 Run'an Lane on Ximen Road in the French Concession, is from Sichuan, 36 years old. He runs the Qing Zihao business on Sima Road, specializing in the transportation and sale of cotton yarn to Sichuan. His mother, wife, and maid are at home. The downstairs is sublet to a three-room tenant, Wu Jingshu and his wife. Yang Junmu returns home from the business at 6:00 or 7:00 PM every day. On the evening before last (the 17th), he had an appointment with relatives, and only his old mother and maid were at home. Unexpectedly, at 8:15 PM, five bandits suddenly broke in through the back door. Three bandits wore gray gowns and bowler hats, and two bandits wore short coats, holding three pistols and speaking with a Sichuan accent. After the bandits entered the door, they first intimidated them into silence, and then drove Yang's mother and the three-room tenants, Wu Jingshu and his wife, into the back parlor, guarded by two bandits. Three bandits went upstairs to ransack boxes and cabinets, wantonly searching and looting. More than 50 yuan in foreign currency, a gold needle worth 32 yuan, and a silver pocket watch and a wristwatch were robbed. There was also an IOU for 400 yuan, which was established by Cheng Zijian on December 17th of the Republic of China. Until around 9:00 PM, the bandits heard the police patrol and escaped with the stolen goods to the roof. It turned out that while the bandits were searching, the Songshan Road Police Station received a phone call from a neighbor in the lane and immediately sent West Inspector Xing Lihua and Inspector Jin Jiulin, leading more than 100 Chinese and foreign detectives, in three trucks and two cars, to Run'an Lane to arrest them. For a while, it was like facing a formidable enemy, and the road was blocked. After the detectives searched the nearby area without success, all the detectives dispersed at 10:30 PM. It is said that the victim has opened a loss report and reported it to the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e171">After Two Bandits Were Arrested <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly Pointed Out That the Victim Had Committed Murder</p>
<p>▲ Said to be the Murderer in the Wang Abao Tragedy</p>
<p>▲ Friends Who Went to the Police Station to Inquire Were Also Arrested</p>
<p>At around 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th of this month, six bandits armed with weapons suddenly came to the home of Kong Guangfu, a native of Anhui, at No. 746 Yongji Lane on Weihaiwei Road, intimidating them into silence. They ransacked boxes and cabinets, robbing Kong and his sister-in-law, Kong Wu, of clothing, jewelry, and silver worth 580 yuan, and fled. Afterwards, Kong reported to the Xinzha Police Station based on information, stating that he had known two of the six bandits for a long time, named Zhou Zhongyi and Zhou Zhonghua, two brothers. The police chief then sent Chinese detective Yue Huayou Shan and Western detective Mu Keying to investigate. On the previous day, they finally found out that the two Zhous were hiding at No. 3923 Daxu Lane on Roberts Road and went to arrest the two Zhous and brought them to the police station. Under questioning, they denied being bandits, but confessed that the plaintiff Kong Guangfu was actually a wanted criminal in a murder case, and had shot and killed Wang Abao, the foreman of the Rigao Gunny Bag Factory, in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China. Kong was then arrested. Not long after, Kong's friend Zhang Guomin went to the police station to inquire and was also identified by the two Zhous as a common criminal in the murder case and was also arrested. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. According to the police lawyer Wang Yaotang's statement of the previous situation, the two Zhous were being prosecuted for robbery, but the police had not yet prosecuted the two criminals, Kong and Zhang, for murder and requested permission to detain them in order to investigate evidence. Then, the witness, the woman Kong Wu, filed a complaint about the situation of being robbed by six bandits who broke into the upstairs the day before, and pointed out in court that the two Zhous were present at the time. When questioned, Zhou Zhongyi denied the robbery and suddenly suffered false accusations. He stated that he had known Kong for a long time. This time, a disaster occurred in Shanghai. Kong secretly colluded with the Japanese and acted as a traitor. After I reported it, Kong was sent to the Garrison Headquarters for detention. He was released only now and held a grudge in his heart, falsely accusing me of being a bandit. However, Kong murdered Wang Bao with a pistol several years ago. This matter was told to us by Kong's friend, a certain Wang. Zhou Zhonghua also did not admit to being a bandit. Three years ago, I met Kong on the road, and Kong invited me to his house and entrusted me with murdering Wang Abao because Wang refused to strike. If the matter was successful, he would give a reward of 40 yuan. I refused. Several days later, Wang Abao was shot and killed, which was obviously done by Kong. Questioning Kong Guangfu, he confessed that Zhou Zhongyi did come to his house the day before to rob, and there were six people upstairs. Because the two Zhous organized the workers' union in the 16th year of the Republic of China, and Yu Shi was the cadre of the workers' department of the Municipal Party Department, he knew each other. He did not know about the murder of Wang Abao. After Wang was killed, the Zhou brothers were arrested by the police station, but he did not know how they were released. Zhang Guomin confessed that he used to work with Kong. Yesterday, he heard that Kong was arrested, so he went to the police station to inquire and was also detained. He knew nothing about the murder case. After verification, Judge Wu Tingqi ordered the two Zhous to wait for another hearing on the 25th, and Kong and Zhang were allowed to be detained for seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Water Police Captain <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Was Accused of Wrongfully Accusing a Good Person of Robbery in a Preliminary Hearing</p>
<p>Luo Daokun, captain of the Third Squad of the First District of the Water Public Security Team, led detectives to Meilong Town on May 29 to capture Wang Ayou, the remnant of Taibao A Shu. He had a conflict with merchant Cai Huanwen and Cai's long-term worker Gu Arong, firing more than 20 shots at the time, causing a great uproar. The case has now been handed over to the judiciary, investigated by Prosecutor Zhao of the local court. Luo Daokun and two police officers stated that according to the informant, the remnant of Taibao A Shu was hiding in Cai Huanwen's home in Meilong Town, so they went to arrest him. Unexpectedly, Cai organized the crowd to resist and injured the police officers. Cai Huanwen and others stated that Luo Daokun led more than 20 people, only three of whom were wearing uniforms, and surrounded the door. They locked and handcuffed Cai and Gu, and then allowed the police officers and plainclothes people to search everywhere, ransacking boxes and cabinets, and even prying up the floor. They did not know why. When asked what crime they had committed, they were beaten, causing Cai and Gu to be beaten until their heads were broken and bleeding, and dragged out. The people were horrified to see it and stopped to ask. Then the water police fired more than 20 shots. Fortunately, the branch chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrived and stopped them, and they were sent to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the Nanyang Hospital for treatment. 125 yuan in cash, a gold ring, and a pair of gold rings were robbed. Therefore, they accused Luo Daokun of falsely accusing a good person of robbery. Prosecutor Zhao inquired the people about the right and wrong of the case. Therefore, in addition to summoning the two parties concerned, he also ordered many local merchants to the case for questioning. However, the merchants who were summoned had submitted a public statement the day before. Therefore, the preliminary hearing was held in the afternoon for a long time, and it was ordered to wait for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Sixth District Cracks Theft Case <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲ Arrested Thieves and Recovered Stolen Goods</p>
<p>In front of the newly built Huikang Li, No. 18, near Caojiadu in the sixth district of Huxi, the home of Zhang Yinqing, around 8:30 AM the day before yesterday, while the family was out, a major theft occurred when thieves scaled the wall. They stole a large sum of banknotes and silver dollars amounting to 850 yuan, two gold lockets (worth about a hundred yuan), a silk long gown, and one silver locket. When the victim realized what happened, they immediately reported it to the sixth district. Upon receiving the report, District Chief Zhang immediately supervised Inspector Xu, Bailiff Chief, Police Officer Liu Dianyuan, and the district detective team leader Xia Pinshan, along with detective Tang Bingsheng, and within three hours, they successively arrested three habitual thieves who were trying to escape. They were all taken back to the district office. After separate interrogations by District Chief Zhang, one confessed to being Li Chunbao (recently released from prison), 18 years old, from Funing. Another confessed to being Li Shiheng (nickname "Muddy Head"), 28 years old, from Funing. The last confessed to being Li Shifa (nickname "Divine Hand Li Wu"), 30 years old, from Funing. All admitted to conspiring to climb over the wall and steal 850 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars, as well as three gold and silver lockets. They confessed to wrapping the stolen goods in the silk gown and taking them out. However, after the stolen goods were taken out of the house, they were handed over to Li Wu's sister A Si, his wife Li Changshi, his brother-in-law Jiang Xiaosanzi, and others, who fled and their whereabouts are unknown. After District Chief Zhang obtained the confession, he again dispatched the original group of officers, police, and detectives to Li Wu's shack, where they seized a wooden box containing the Wu family's genealogy. It is said that the genealogy was stolen from a primary school in Huxi last year (the genealogy has been torn). They also seized smoking paraphernalia, red pills, and other items, which were all taken to the station. It was also found that these thieves had been repeatedly punished for committing crimes in the past, but they still stubbornly refused to repent, which was truly detestable. They were then prepared with documents and sent to the General Bureau for strict handling. It is also reported that the third branch of the Caojiadu Citizens' Association was delighted to learn that habitual thief Li Wu had been arrested and sent to the bureau. They all said that the thief had been hiding in Huxi, colluding with accomplices to rob and steal, committing numerous crimes, and harming the local area to a great extent. Yesterday, they specially submitted a petition to District Chief Zhang, requesting him to forward it to the bureau chief for strict punishment, in order to appease the public.</p>

<p>The Maochang General Company in this city has branches in various places north of the Yangtze River, purchasing eggs. Over the years, it has been very peaceful. Recently, however, bandits have been rampant in the area, and robberies have occurred from time to time. The company's Liuzhuang branch in Xinghua County was suddenly robbed last month. More than ten days later, the case has not yet been solved. Furthermore, a batch of fresh eggs being shipped from the Yancheng branch to Shaobo was also robbed of 56 baskets of eggs. After the company reported the information to the local industry association, the association said that its members had many branches north of the Yangtze River. If such unexpected dangers continue to occur, how can the industry operate?

<p>Employees of the Municipal Public Works Bureau are planning to trial consumer cooperatives, including laborers, craftsmen, and others. Representatives have been mutually elected for several days to discuss the matter. The first step is to investigate the approximate annual consumption of the employees and the bureau's kitchen.

In terms of value, it is 6,393 yuan per year for parts, 2,561 yuan for shoes and socks, 5,495 yuan for books, and 857 yuan for cigarettes. The second step is to negotiate with various industrial and commercial factories and stores to agree on special transaction conditions. The methods are temporarily assumed to be the following four types: (A) To make a special agreement with several factories or stores to give preferential treatment to colleagues to purchase goods at low prices, using specially made vouchers, and the individuals go to trade with cash; (B) To make a special agreement with several factories or stores to give preferential treatment to colleagues to purchase goods at low prices, delivering goods upon notification and paying upon delivery; (C) To make a special agreement with several factories or stores to give preferential treatment to colleagues to purchase goods at low prices, issuing a folder in the name of the organization to collect and pay on a regular basis; (D) To make a special agreement with several factories and stores to purchase certain goods in bulk at low prices with cash at one time, and the purchasing colleagues distribute them according to their needs. For grains, fuels, and various oils, it is hoped that the contracting factories and stores can deliver them to each household. Each person is contacting them separately. The third step is for the employees to raise funds to run their own store to sell retail consumer goods and handle wholesale goods to be distributed. As for the transportation of goods, 19 people live in Shanghai South, 4 in Zhabei, 16 east of Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, 30 west of it, 3 in the central district of the Public Concession, 6 in the western district, and 2 in the eastern district. It is heard that there are no less than 400 households of the bureau's employees, craftsmen, and laborers, and if other colleagues from municipal agencies also join in the future, there will be no less than 20,000 households. Moreover, all transactions are in cash, and domestic products are the main focus. Therefore, various factories and stores in the city have the opportunity to make large cash transactions. Those who wish to trade can directly contact the bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Bigamy <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw a news story about a wealthy businessman who cheated on a female painter in marriage. The original wife filed for divorce, and the new bride made a big fuss and returned to Ningbo alone. This incident was truly a case of ["a hunchback falling, failing at both ends"], and instead evolved into a family tragedy.</p>
<p>Originally, such tragedies happen every day in Shanghai. It is truly commonplace. This is just one example. The crime of bigamy is clearly stipulated in the law, but people living in Shanghai are often tempted by the environment, or they dislike the old and like the new, or they think of carnal desires when they are well-fed and warm. Therefore, we often see such tragic cases of burning the zither and cooking the crane. Although the law is such, it is not an absolute guarantee. As long as you can get through two conditions:</p>
<p>First, have a special status so that the law can lose its effect.</p>
<p>Second, have absolute financial power, and there will certainly be a way to resolve it.</p>
<p>If you don't have the above two latent forces, not only will your family be in disarray, but you will also be subject to criminal penalties.</p>

<p>Accompanying Mr. and Mrs. Pei Chu and Ms. Huang Baoying and my wife,</p>
<p>In the Jia Ping year, we returned together to the ruins of our old home on Yokohama Road, feeling this touch of sadness. Thickets of thorns fill the eye, old dreams are difficult to warm, spring flowers and autumn moon all become dust, and the sorrow of the millet and sorghum leaving the homeland darkens the dusk. Do not speak of the past, there is endless bitterness, and the sorrow of life is to leave the group. When will the green willow trees and the three-path moon be together again with kind neighbors?</p>

<p>Zero smoke and remnant mist on the Jiangnan Road, so quietly spring returns. How many times has the moon been round since we parted? Green willows, red apricots, painted buildings, and vermilion doors are all places of sadness. The sound of the Hu flute chokes in the setting sun, and I sing Du Ling's sentences with hatred in vain. The sorrow of the old country is so deep, a few cries of cuckoo birds, a day of mad catkins, and a desolate rain on the river.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Refreshing Straw Hats <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Di Lei</p>
<p>Straw hats are a necessary item for summer. Usually, all classes in society each have one. However, our experience with wearing straw hats is that almost every season, when we no longer need them, even if we store them very well, we inevitably have to replace them with new ones next summer. This is because the originally white wheat straw turns into an unsightly yellow or becomes dull and lackluster after a few months. There are many advertisements in the market for refreshing straw hats. Economical friends seem to think it is a pity to discard them, so they spend a few jiao to have them washed. In fact, the discoloration of straw hats can be considered a kind of reduction reaction. The original wheat straw was yellow. After the manufacturing factory made the straw hats, they forcibly bleached them. Naturally, after a certain period of time, they will restore their original appearance. Although I have never opened a straw hat washing shop, based on my experience, I dare to offer an effective and easy method. If the reader is interested, you may want to try it according to the method.</p>
<p>Prepare a basin of clean water, four glass cups, three brushes, oxalic acid, potassium permanganate, and sodium thiosulfate (i.e., large soda) in small amounts. Soak each in a concentrated solution and put them in the cups.</p>
<p>First, wash the straw hat in clean water to remove accumulated dust and dirt in the seams. While the straw hat is not completely dry, use a brush to dip in the potassium permanganate solution and apply it evenly once. The straw hat will be dyed a layer of dark purple color. After applying it well, place it in the sun for about three minutes. Then use another brush to dip in the oxalic acid solution and apply it to the purple hat. As you apply it, brush it. The purple potassium permanganate will react with the oxalic acid, releasing oxygen and bleaching the straw hat. Wash it with clean water, then brush it with the sodium thiosulfate solution, and it will be as white as new. After it is dry, it can be worn.</p>
<p>The principle is that oxalic acid reacts with potassium permanganate to release oxygen, which oxidizes the yellow wheat straw and makes it colorless. After washing, adding sodium thiosulfate can remove the residual acidity (the oxalic acid solution is acidic and cannot adhere to the hat). This very simple method can be completed in a quarter of an hour, and the chemicals only cost a small amount. It is far more economical than replacing it with a new one, and it also seems more economical and very reliable than asking a hat washing shop to wash it.</p>
<p>Note: After brushing the straw hat, it is easy to become uneven when drying. Just press it with a weight before it is dry, and it will be flat. It is best to use several volumes of Western-style books.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Modern Gentleman <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Xia</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to my close friend Mr. Wang's house and saw that his neighbor lived a modern couple. The man was wearing a suit, looking very energetic, and loved to say "Excuse me," "Hello," "Yes," with a sense of abundance in his ears.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wang, this brother is full of foreign air. There are two things that are quite interesting to talk about.</p>
<p>This brother has a younger sister who is over ten years old. One day, he accompanied her on a public bus to go somewhere. The ticket seller came to sell him tickets, and he only bought one ticket. The ticket seller asked why his sister didn't buy one. He repeatedly said, "Small." What he meant was that girls could ride for free. Coincidentally, the ticket seller didn't understand English, so he said sternly, "We don't care about Fourth Ma Road or Fifth Ma Road, you still have to buy a ticket." Everyone nearby laughed. In the end, he had to buy the ticket.</p>
<p>Another time, his wife went out and hadn't returned, and he felt very lonely. He decided to go see a movie to relieve his boredom. When he was about to leave, he told his nanny, "If Madam comes back and asks about me, you can say 'Cinema'." Who knew that his nanny didn't understand what he meant and thought that he and his wife had turned against each other. Afterwards, she sighed to others behind her back, "Alas! The gentlemen of today are really rude. I never thought that our master in Western clothes would say 'Cao Ni Ma'." It turned out that she had misunderstood "Cinema."</p>
<p>Business Faces</p>
<h3 id="e191">Several Special Faces <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Yiping</p>
<p>Postal service employees seem to be all taught by the same master. If you take express mail or registered mail to the post office before 9:00, the masters will talk and laugh freely, letting you wait outside the copper frame for their judgment. After 9:00, they will slowly prepare their work tools and issue receipts for a stack of letters and documents. Sometimes there are too many letters, and if it passes 12:00, no matter how important your letter is, please come again in the afternoon. I'm afraid the slow mail has already been sent to the station.</p>
<p>A rural old woman carrying a package mistakenly stepped into a first-class tram. The ticket seller shouted fiercely, "Go to the back, go to the back!" Because the rural woman was already at the junction of the first three classes, she politely asked the ticket seller, "Sir, thank you, open it a little," hoping that the ticket seller would open the middle door. The ticket seller reluctantly opened the door and let her pass, and slammed the door shut, cursing, "Swine."</p>
<p>"Sir, I'm sorry." Obviously, the payment did not match the invoice, and he already had a smiling face towards people.</p>
<p>The clerks in silk shops and foreign goods stores also have genuine rubber faces. If you are a rural bumpkin, don't pester them this way and that. The old bosses hire them to deal with female customers.</p>
<p>A friend calls and says that his factory needs to add bookkeepers. You go to the writing room before 9:00 tomorrow to meet the boss for an interview. The next day, I rushed to his office, but the boss had not yet arrived. After 9:30, I was sent in to see the so-called boss with a high belly. My friend went to tell him to wait outside because he was busy with official business.</p>
<p>At 11:30, I was summoned into the boss's room. The "interview" only asked the following simple questions.</p>
<p>"Which school did you graduate from?"</p>
<p>"Have you worked after graduating?"</p>
<p>"Do you have experience in bookkeeping?"</p>
<p>"Report to the factory tomorrow!" And signed a pass for me to enter the factory (the writing room is on ×× Road, and the factory is located in Pudong).</p>
<p>In two hours, there was not even a three-minute gap to ask the above questions. Seeing the Louis Stone performing face he had when he asked the questions, it must be the boss's air!</p>

<h3 id="e192">Another Registration Fee <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>The girl had just returned from school, and before even putting down her schoolbag, she earnestly said to her mother:</p>
<p>"Mom? The school is asking for another registration fee."</p>
<p>"What?" the mother said, "Another registration fee?" Then she said to me:</p>
<p>"Mr. L! Don't you find it strange? Their school asks for a registration fee every semester."</p>
<p>So I took a slip of paper from the girl's hand, and saw the following printed in lead type:</p>
<p>"As this semester is nearing its end, if student ××× wishes to continue studying at this school in the next semester, it is hoped that</p>
<p>the parents will promptly pay the registration fee of five yuan according to regulations, in order to register.  This is to notify you.  Sincerely, Principal ××× Attached note: This notification is not to be used as a receipt for money.  When the registration fee is paid, the school's accounting office will issue a separate receipt as proof."</p>
<p>At that time, I was simply stunned.  I really don't understand, what exactly does this school do? Then the girl said:</p>
<p>"When school was dismissed, the teacher gave everyone a slip like this. She said to bring it at the latest in five days. Everyone has to bring it."</p>
<p>"What strict school rules," I thought. "It must be paid within five days." So the girl's mother angrily said to me in Mandarin:</p>
<p>"This principal is really clever. For example, if you pay this five yuan, then this student is his, and he is sure that you will still pay the tuition. Even if you don't go there again, then at least he gets these five dollars." Then I continued:</p>
<p>"Humph! Five yuan per person, fifty for ten people, five hundred for a hundred people! Ah! That's a really big income!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it?" the mother said again. "Another registration fee, it's simply to get rich!"</p>

<p>In the article on taking laws from fruit juice, the name Ethyleve was not used.  It was found to be due to an error in the article signed by Qing Jun on the method of early ripening of vegetables and fruits.  I will not answer on his behalf. At the same time, I also want to know the details, because Ethyle is something whose boiling point is more than 100 degrees below zero Celsius. It is a gas at room temperature. The manufacturing method is very simple, but drug stores probably can't buy it, and it can't be sprayed like a liquid. After the contributor replies, I hope it can be published to explain the question. Yonghuai respectfully replies.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>On the seventh of this month, I read Mr. Shen Zhibin's article "Classification of Rubber Product Manufacturing Methods and Overview of Factories in Our Country" in your publication. The instructions on the four types of vulcanization methods are very detailed, and I am very grateful.  However, could you please ask Mr. Shen Zhibin to reveal one or two ingredients for vulcanization? How much of each ingredient is mixed in direct steam vulcanization, such as the sublimed sulfur used for dissolving rubber, and the amount of Shengshilin ingredient?  If you want to make the rubber color white, should you add zinc oxide, and how much of each ingredient?  Please let me know everything. The success of small industries depends entirely on you, sir. I respectfully wish you good health.  Respectfully, Yu Wang Liheng.</p>

<p>▲ Nanjing's "Glamorous Attire Convention" Starting yesterday at the Nanjing Grand Theater, the glamorous attire convention of Shanghai beauties, which is unseen and unheard of, is deeply praised by the audience. During the performance, eight graceful and beautiful young ladies, as beautiful as celestial beings, slowly walked onto the stage, like dancing flowers and butterflies. The thin chiffon nightgowns and swimsuits they wore were all brightly colored and newly styled. The film "The History of Choosing a Husband" also used the competition of beautiful women as its background, and told the story of a young girl who was deeply poisoned by vanity, resulting in the blemish of white jade, which is both sad and lamentable. The theater has already used air conditioning, allowing people to enjoy the grand event and excellent films, and to dispel the benefits of boredom.</p>
