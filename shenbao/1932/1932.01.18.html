<h3 id="c28">所謂新的外交方案翰 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>南京傳來消息。外交當局將提出一新外交方案。要點有三。一對日絶交。二請美國召開第二次華府會議。三向國聯提盟約十六條。此說傳出以後。立法院之秘密會議席上。聚論紛紜。足見此問題之嚴重東北問題發生後。我國於不抵抗之外。究將如何應付。迄今猶在猶豫沈悶之中。或者今日將一掃雲霧而揭開久久籠罩之面幕乎。</p>
<p>國聯之不足恃。吾人已屢次論及。早成洞穿之紙虎無從再。戳盟約十六條望文生義。殊爲嚴重。然所謂經濟絶交與武力準備。國聯實無强施之能力。故十六條第二叚對此兩點。已說明國聯行政院之責任。僅在向諸盟員國「建議。」在理論上已知其萬難實行况國聯三次决議。皆足以證明各國紙無用斷然手叚之决心故今日即提出十六條。結果亦决無希。望至多於國際間多造一種空氣。延挨時日而已。</p>
<p>請美國召集第二次華府會議之說。其意義在希望美提警告以後。作進一步之表現。此進一步之表現。關鍵不在美國而在列强。列强對此次照會。態度幾一致冷淡。而日覆美牒内容尤爲滑稽。在此情勢之下。而欲美國召集第二次華府會議。有所不能亦已可知。</p>
<p>外交當局三擬議中。惟對日絶交一點。最爲嚴重。夫「絶交」之意義在一般國際公法學者之主張。實爲「兩國間入於正式交戰狀態後之當然結果。」其宣佈可在戰前行之。一八九八年之西美戰。爭一九零四年之日俄戰爭是也。亦可與戰爭同時行之。一九一一年之土意戰爭是也。故在原則上絶交與開戰互爲表裏。不可强分。若有人主張僅絶交而不戰。是昧于國際法之當理。更昧於國際關係之史實也至若我在敵國敵在我國之僑民的生命財產。應如何處置。及對于第三國之通知等。亦爲絶交後應有之文章。不可不預爲準備者也。</p>
<p>今作反對絶交之說者多注重事實之利害。曰絶交旣與交戰狀態互相表裏。我人空洞之宣佈旣出。而自身若無萬一之準備則奈何。贊成絶交之說者。多注重國家之人格。曰九一八之變。因循至今忍無可忍。惟有出於寗爲玉碎。毋爲瓦全之一策。</p>
<p>我人對於絶交一點在原則上無可非議一·今日中日雖未宣戰。而日軍之行動早入於交戰狀態乃仍各駐使節。互相周旋。實爲國際間鮮有之怪例。二·日本利用此項奇異之狀態。在國際間始終揚言中日問題。决非戰爭直接交涉希望未絶。東北問題尤爲局部問題。我方實無以自解三·自國人對日經濟絶交以後。全國民衆。埩扎支持。聲嘶力竭。若不再繼以政治的絶交。則上下不能一貫。何能團結對。外四·此絶交之宣佈。對於國際。亦可予列國以强烈之剌激一方面正告列國。中日間已進於非常嚴重狀態一方面對國聯提出十六條時。發生連鎖關係。從此可以振振有詞。</p>
<p>惟我人認實行此絶交之方針。有三天前提。須切實解决一·政府應掬至誠告全體國民。政府已下絶大决心。激勵國民奮起二·政府須立即召集全國在役之軍人。决定非常時期之國防。並在關外前綫。先與敵人掙扎。三·國民須與政府痛切合作。對作戰之費用。軍需之接濟。地方秩序之維持救國運動之擴大等等。須在最短期間解决實行。若當局對此三大前提。無切實準備與决心。則絶交後之前途自難樂觀。政府若果有堅强决心。以國家生死問題國内要電二</p>

<p>前列是二十部摩托車領路，隨着便是Ｘ政府的軍樂隊，工部局的軍樂隊，最後是數不完（聽說是四百部）的汽車，裝着花圈，挿着郭府的旗子，一部一部比手車還慢的在大馬路上走過，馬路邊是人山人海的擠在那兒看丨看郭標出殯！</p>

<p>— 芮禹成</p>
<p>果報雖是迷信。然而冥冥之中。也有一種不可思議的玄秘之理。我曾親身經歷過一件事情。現在把它記出來。作爲諸位讀者研究的資料。</p>
<p>民國十六年。我在奉軍中充任團長。部下有一士兵名呌鍾得勝的。是一個倚勢凌人的惡劣份子。有一次。他教一個貧苦的老嫗替他做了一雙鞋子。講定二千文。做成以後。鍾得勝付了一元。老嫗找了尾欵給他。當時錢貨兩交。停了一會。老嫗忽然啼哭而來。口稱命苦不已。原來那塊銀圓是銅的。不能通用。老嫗便來尋鍾得勝請他掉換。但鍾却是有意欺朦。堅持不認。老嫗本來想藉此謀利。那知賠了鞋子。又折去找頭。越發啼哭不休。可是也不敢和鍾理論。我剛巧路過門前。詢明原由。我心裏明白。只得就給了老嫗一元。把銅銀元取了過來。隨手納在袋内。這事才算完了。</p>
<p>没有隔了多時。晋奉之戰忽起。我們都奉命開拔到前方去了。這一天我正在指揮部隊進擊。忽有一彈飛來。直向我的腹部。當時那能閃避。惟有束手待斃。可是並未受害。心想不知是何道理。再一細看。原來那槍彈却巧射在銅銀元上面。把銅銀元打成一個鍋形。因此未曾繫傷。我便想起鍾得勝來。到晚間檢查隊伍。才曉得鍾得勝老早就陣亡了。</p>
<p>這件故事是我親身經歷的。直到現在那塊銅銀元我還保存着。這豈不是果報昭彰嗎。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第二回談笑對良師傳噩耗家園遇刦零丁憐膩友慰悽情旅室生春</p>
<p>我們那家鄉地方最不好。處在那最偏僻的亂山之中。近年周圍不知嘯聚了多少土匪。這些拉杆的頭兒。受了日本浪人的利用。暗中供給他們的金錢和槍械。唆使他們四出擾害地方。好給與日本以進兵侵略的機會。他們那懂得這利害。果然就集合徒黨。動不動一兩千人或三五百人一杆不等。把我們那地方蹂躪得没有一片乾凈土地。不是明火刦掠。就是綁票勒贖。鬧得人民半天也不能太平。我住在縣城裏。多少還有點軍隊警察守城。比較安全一些。他安家寨是在鄉下。就常常有土匪結隊成羣的前去骚擾。後來鄉下所有的村鎭。見官兵鞭長莫及。不能保護他們。聯合着議定自衛的方法。由各村鎭自行組織民團。防禦土匪。玉田的父親安老太爺。本是地方上著名的紳士。又是安家寨的村長。便公推舉他老人家做民團總團長。說到這。偶而咳嗽了一聲。梁笑雲欲正因聽得不耐。就剪斷他這話道。你又來胡扯。我是急於要問他出了什麽亂事誰有心思來細聽這些土匪和民團的事情。魏卓謀也發急道。樹從根上起。水向遠處流。要談一件事。總得從頭把原因細說。不想你恁般性躁。那麽。我便簡單直截的說罷。前半月中。他父親不知爲了什麽緣故。得罪了一個土匪大頭兒名呌牛黑風的。帶了一般人打進了他的安家寨。逢人便殺。遇房便燒。他父母老兩口兒。全死在土匪的亂槍之下。整個寨子是被洗乾凈了。房屋是燒燬完了。他還有個小兄弟。至今生死不明。後來官軍聞訊往援。土匪們捆載了許多財物。綁了幾個肉票。在官軍未到前就呼嘯而去。安家寨只剩下一堆瓦礫灰燼連死者的後事都没法辦。你想玉田接着這個家破人亡的噩耗。心中當是何等的慘痛。還有閒暇工夫能到你這兒來嗎。這一串話。似連珠箭般那麽不停留的射出。一枝枝直戳到梁笑雲脆薄的芳心裏。登時地場天崩。花容失色。那嬌紅的粉頰上。忽地慘淡得似一層白紙。并好像渾身肢體。齊跌在一個酷寒的决窖中。禁不住一陣陣的冷戰。不由就抖着一隻玉手。緊抓着魏卓謀的臂膀顫聲問道。這　這多麽嚇人。不是把他活活争壞了嗎。現···現在他又打算怎麽辦呢。</p>

<p>— 丁奴</p>
<p>終日在馬路上彳亍，挑了一擔的橘子和甘蔗，到處去兜賣，每日雖然只能賺到四五角，但一家人都靠這入息過活。他過着這個生活，已有好幾年了。</p>
<p>有一天，他喜氣洋洋的傍晚跑回家裏來，對着他的妻子說：「我今天交了好運，走到一個學堂門前去兜賣，幾乎把貨賣光了，明天準定到浦東去買些新貨來，你看！」</p>
<p>他說着，就把袋裏的錢盡數掏出來。白洋洋的銀幣的閃光，吸住了他的妻子的視線，他的妻子滿意的笑。了</p>
<p>從這時候起，他便天天站在學堂門前兜賣。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>約有一年之後，學堂門前建起了一座平房，店面前擺了很多新鮮的水菓，架子上供着各色各樣的罐頭，香烟，裏面便是一間咖啡室。一般學生們散了課，都走到這裏來，吃水菓，飲咖啡，從早晨起一直到晚上，裏面簡直没有空過座，時常都能看見有人圍繞在店門前，生意可以說是很好的了。</p>
<p>這時候，誰都知道一年以前在馬路上挑擔子的兜賣者，現在是做起這平房的老板來了。</p>
<p>老板滿面風光，站在店門口，對着顧客點點頭，笑迷迷的！</p>
<p>不多入，這裏面却多了一個中年婦人，身材胖胖的，眼睛烏溜溜的轉着，一付嬌嫩好看的面孔，惹得老板洩漏了不少的春光。聽說這個婦人，就是老板新近娶的姨太太，老板的福氣眞不淺呢！</p>
<p>那時候，老板的心花怒放，常常偕着姨太太到外面去逛。從這時起，就很少見到老板在店門口站着。了</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>這是三年後的一天下午，北風括着，天氣很冷，馬路上簡直没有人走。這時候，從學堂門口推出一輛糞車，裏面滿滿的盛着一些殘餘菜汁，大槪是拿來喂猪用的。那推車的人，汗溜溜的，東斜西歪的推着，顯然他是没那樣大的力。</p>
<p>他走過後，有人站在學堂門口這樣說着：</p>

<p>前天周君的「空氣壓扁洋鐵罐」是物理上的玩意兒；現在「噴水池」，是化學上的玩意兒；不過這二個實騐，都是靠空氣壓力，而發生這等現象，所以可稱爲證明氣壓力的二個方法。</p>
<p>「噴水池」的搆造是很簡單的：祇要玻璃瓶，杯子，長玻璃管，象皮球，吸水管，乾電池各一件，和二根銅絲，一杯鹽水，那就夠了；先將瓶上的木塞，穿兩個空，預備挿吸水管和長管；繼將空杯子裏，盛滿了紅水或别色水，吸水管也裝些水；再把二根銅絲，接到電池的二極，這銅絲别一端，都挿入鹽水裏，（即使電流通過鹽水），不多時，鹽水變成黄綠色，乃傾些綠水於瓶裏，於是將瓶上木塞蓋好；後把瓶放在火上加熱，則見水氣漸漸蒸出，等到綠水差不多乾了，便將長管和吸水管立刻裝上，且把這瓶顚倒轉來，使長管别一端浸入那杯紅水裏。</p>
<p>這時候「噴水池」已造成了，祇要你將象皮球（裝在吸水管上的）一揑，杯子裏的紅水，便立刻從管子裏往上升，到了上端，很急的噴出來丨眞好看，活像一個「噴水池」丨直到杯子裏的紅水噴完了，才停止。</p>
<p>這玩意兒的原理，是很普通的；綠水就是含鹽酸的水（因爲這水中尙含Ｎash）當時放在瓶裏加熱的時候，牠即化爲氣體，將瓶裏空氣驅出而，使瓶内僅含多量的鹽酸氣；後將象皮球一揑，水便從吸水管射入瓶内，因爲「鹽酸氣很溶解於水内」所以瓶内氣體立刻溶在水内，而使瓶内成眞空即氣壓减低，因此杯子裏的紅水，受了空間空氣的壓力（每方時所受壓力等於十五磅力）就向壓力小的瓶内上升這樣，便成了一個「噴水池」的玩意兒。</p>

<p>他呌出那憎惡的怪聲，怒目地注視着那位鄉人，凶惡地將他的左臂壓在自己右臂的下面，然後，才怒氣稍平般地看着他手中的小報。那位鄉人當然是不作一聲地毫無反抗。但我却看在眼裏，記在心中！</p>

<p>如此上海之一丨</p>
<p>自從籌設小規模的圖書館的計劃决定了以後，第二天，我，唯心，澤浦，便去選租館址。丨其實就是租兩間平房。</p>
<p>我們沿着河南路走去。不遠，我們便發現了一張「吉房招租」的「紅帖」。於是，我們就停止前進了。</p>
<p>『鐺鐺鐺····』唯心上前把電鈴按了一下。不到一分鐘的光景，便有一個胖得象猪一樣的娘姨出來開門。</p>
<p>『儂有啥事體呀？』娘姨把門半開半掩着問我們。</p>
<p>『看房子！···』唯心這樣答覆她</p>
<p>出租的房子是在三層樓上。我們上去前前後後，左左右右的看了一遭，房間是不大不小，有寢室又有辦公室，日光，空氣····均不感缺乏。恰巧是爲着我們留下的一樣。我們下到了客堂裏，半個人影也看不到。於是，唯心高呌了一聲：</p>
<p>『喂！』······</p>
<p>一個穿着短衣滿堆着脂粉而又蓬鬆着頭髮的中年婦人出來了。唯心便向她問道：</p>
<p>『儂的房子啥個價錢？」</p>
<p>『三十二塊！』</p>
<p>我們不禁搖了搖頭，都咋舌了。</p>
<p>丨『儂有家眷没？』我們還没有還價，中年婦人便這樣追問我們。</p>
<p>『没！』唯心答覆她。</p>
<p>『没家眷，弗租丨』中年婦人兩手叉進腰裏走了。·····</p>
<p>於是，我們又只好走第二家。</p>
<p>一家二家的走去，整整的跑了半天，房子，不是没有；也不是我們的銅錢太少；唯一的原因就是我們「没有家眷」，而他們是『非眷莫租』啊！</p>
<p>我覺得這太豈有此理了！没有「女人」（家眷）就不住房子嗎？十二點鐘的時候（我們是上午八點鐘出發的）回來，我很憤恨的說：『不行丨今天下午我還得去租取！我不相信没有女人就租不到房子的！···』</p>
<p>唯心是老於上海的，他聽了我的說話，他便向我解釋道：</p>
<p>『這也不怪他們！的確，有許多單身男子去租房子，住了會不給他們的錢就走了的！他們的意思是：只要你有一個家眷，男子可以跑掉，「女人」總是跑不掉的！····於是，他們就放心了。·······丨上海人就是這樣的啊！···』</p>
<p>我覺得唯心的說話有理。同時，我纔明白了：</p>
<p>『上海人原來是這樣的啊！丨不，</p>
<p>上海的社會原來是這樣的啊！···』哈哈！有趣！····</p>

<p>Ｘ外灘的成功</p>
<p>外灘原來是黄浦江邊一條船夫拉縴所行的小路，中國官廳在公佈第一次的租界土地管理章程的時，候早已聲明保存這一條縴夫所行的小路。規定在臨河的房屋與河邊之間須留三十英尺的空地，即是房屋的建造，須離河邊三十英尺。因此外人建造房屋必須在地基前面所對的一段河邊打椿，並且要塡平這一段路。這就是外灘的起源，不過在那時候還是泥濘難行的路：現在却成爲極精美的散步的地方了。現在上海的特色之一，即是對河的房屋與河邊之間，有一條很寛闊的空地。這一帶寛闊的空地的保留，原來的用意，並不是在美觀方面着想，却是要留下一條大路給船夫接縴。</p>

<p>(Harbin) On the 15th, Yu Shenwei's detachment was discovered in Nanheilinzi, Shuangcheng. A unit of the 22nd Brigade went to intercept them. Yu's troops only fired into the air, shouting that they were all brothers and should not fight each other recklessly, but merely meet and report back.

<p>(Harbin) The Jilin and Bin County troops are confronting each other in Yushu, Wuchang, and Taolai Zhao on the southern line of the China Eastern Railway. Jin Xuanwu, the Jilin representative, is currently in Harbin negotiating a reconciliation with Zhang Jinghui. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Harbin dispatch: The Northeast 3rd Infantry Brigade, originally stationed in the Yushu area, is facing the Japanese desire to expand their influence to the China Eastern Railway line. They incited Xi Qia to send 8,000 troops to attack Yushu. The brigade commander, Zhang Zuozhou, is prepared to resist to the death.

(17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Yesterday, it was heard that troops supporting Zhang Zuoxiang would clash with the Japanese army in northern Jilin, but it is now known that the Chinese army will retreat without fighting. According to recent news, the Chinese army plans to establish a Jilin provincial government in Yushu, remaining loyal to Zhang Xueliang. Yushu is located between Jilin and Harbin, east of the China Eastern Railway line. Establishing a government there may be difficult to ensure security, as Japanese aircraft flew over the area twice yesterday, dropping six bombs in the morning and three in the afternoon, killing and injuring ten people. If Yushu is unsuitable, the location of the Jilin provincial government will be moved to Sanxing, which is located northeast of Harbin and has a large stockpile of ammunition. It is said that Zhang Zuoxiang has now sent diplomatic experts to Sanxing to build an arsenal because all of his arsenals in Jilin have now been occupied by the Japanese. It is widely believed that Zhang Zuoxiang will invite Ma Zhanshan to take the position of Jilin Provincial Chairman. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Force Puyi to Acknowledge Secret Agreement</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shenyang news: When Yoshizawa passed through Shenyang, he secretly negotiated several times with Puyi's representatives Zheng Xiaoxu, Jin Liang, and others regarding the issue of acknowledging the secret agreement. The Japanese side knows that the authenticity of the secret agreement cannot be verified and that the Nanjing government will never recognize it. Therefore, they are coercing Puyi to recognize it so that they can obtain a legal basis. The Tokyo Foreign Ministry suddenly announced its unilateral secret agreement on the 15th, with that intention. Dalian dispatch: Puyi has indeed secretly gone to Shenyang from Tanggangzi, actively preparing for a restoration, still using the Xuantong reign title.

<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Stimson released China's reply to the United States today. The Japanese reply to the U.S. note was also sent by telegram from Ambassador Forbes in Japan today. However, it is expected that it will not be released until the beginning of next week at the earliest, and Stimson may not be able to comment on it before Monday, as he spent most of his day attending the Senate Investigating Committee and being consulted by the committee members, and has not had time to study the Japanese reply. According to sources here, the U.S. government will temporarily refrain from further action on the Liaoning case, as the League of Nations Council meeting is imminent.

<p>(Beiping) British Ambassador Lampson, in view of the Japanese decision to transfer the Yuguan-Shenyang section of the Beining Railway to the South Manchuria Railway Company for joint operation, which hinders British creditor rights in the railway and violates the Sino-British loan contract, lodged a serious protest with the Japanese side on the 16th.

<h3 id="e11">Issue of Severing Diplomatic Relations with Japan <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Needs to be Decided by the Highest-Level Meeting</p>
<p>Cannot be Resolved in a Short Period</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Youren advocated the strongest for the issue of severing diplomatic relations with Japan, and Feng Yuxiang also expressed his agreement. However, most of the Central Committee members still advocated caution because preparations for war would be required after severing diplomatic relations. Moreover, this major issue must be discussed and decided by the Political Conference of the Central Government, the highest-level organ. The two Standing Committee members of the Political Conference, Wang and Chiang, are about to come to Nanjing, and it is necessary to wait for their arrival to convene a highest-level meeting to resolve whether to declare the severance of diplomatic relations. If the severance of diplomatic relations is unanimously passed, the second step strategy will be further studied, to complete all procedures in accordance with international practice on the one hand, and to concentrate national strength and take all effective actions on the other hand. The matter is of great importance, so although the atmosphere has become tense recently, it cannot be resolved in the shortest period of time. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A German advisor said that the term "severing diplomatic relations" is possible in international law, but it is limited to cases where the two countries are either relatively far apart or have no significant economic relationship. If the two countries have too many intertwined creditor and debtor relationships, and declare the severance of diplomatic relations, they must be prepared for the second step of declaring war before proceeding. If they only declare the severance of diplomatic relations without preparing for war, and if the other party uses the excuse of the location of the investment to send personnel to take care of it themselves, the sovereign country will have to refuse. Refusal will inevitably lead to war. Therefore, it must be handled with caution. If the authorities are using the high-profile announcement of severing diplomatic relations as a way to appease public sentiment in order to discover new avenues for negotiation, then it should be treated differently.

I believe that this First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee appointed you and me as Standing Committee members of the Political Conference. The duties of the Standing Committee members are only to take turns chairing the meetings. It would not be a major problem if we were accidentally absent due to circumstances. However, the intention of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is to encourage you and me to work together to overcome the national crisis.

<p>The Decision to Implement a Reduction in Military and Government Expenditures</p>
<p>Hoping That the Financial Community Will Find a Way to Raise Funds</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This newspaper's reporter visited Sun Ke on the evening of the 17th and inquired about diplomatic and financial issues. Sun replied as follows: After Wang arrived in Hangzhou,</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>telegrams have already arrived in Beijing. After Hu comes north, Wang and Chiang will come to Beijing together. I have already telegraphed Hu to come quickly. Regarding financial issues, the Special Committee has decided to implement a reduction in military and government expenditures after two days of consultations. The previous budget for military expenditures was 18 million per month, and government expenditures were 4 million per month. Now, military expenditures will be reduced to 16 million, and government expenditures will be reduced to 2 million. The Central Executive Yuan, departments, councils, and party fees will be reduced by 50% within six months. The National Government will issue an order to abolish all unnecessary organs and lay off redundant personnel. The Executive Yuan has persuaded Finance Minister Huang Hanliang and Vice Minister Lin Kanghou, who resigned, to stay in office and telegraphed the financial community in Shanghai, explaining that there is no delay in the payment of principal and interest on public debt. The same measures will continue to be taken for public debt in the future, and its credit will be maintained. However, the central government's monthly income is only more than 6 million, which is still 10 million short. It is hoped that the financial community will find a way to raise funds for one or two months to make up for the shortfall. In the future, after the tax collection is reorganized, there may be a solution. As for the issue of increasing revenue, the Finance Committee will discuss it in detail in the future. The issue of severing diplomatic relations with Japan is still under discussion. It will only be decided after Wang, Hu, Chiang, and others come to Beijing. The National Crisis Conference has been changed to February 1st due to the short time. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai financial community plans to jointly raise 7 million per month for central military and government expenditures as a condition for rescinding the proposed suspension of payment of principal and interest on public debt, temporarily limited to two months. The government authorities, with huge differences in military and government expenditures, still hope that they will be more generous in their planning and assist with 8 million per month to tide over the difficulties.

<p>(Nanjing) Li Jishen said that he is incapable of the important post of Minister of Training Director due to his limited ability and virtue. At this moment, the anti-Japanese national salvation should be the urgent plan. If there is such work, he will do his best. Mr. Feng Huanzhang is most suitable for the post of Training Director. The dispatch of Zhang Fakui's troops to aid Heilongjiang will become a reality. In the future, the government may issue an order to suppress bandits, because Japan is waging an undeclared war against us, claiming to suppress bandits, deceiving the people of the world. We can also wage an undeclared war, using bandit suppression to deal with it. As for the Longzhou incident, it will be resolved soon. I absolutely guarantee that there is no danger in Guangxi and that it will not become the second northeastern province. If the French troops want to bully our country, the entire military and civilians of Guangxi will be able to resist to the death. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Seize Yingkou Salt Surplus for Other Uses</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person arriving from Shenyang reported that on New Year's Day, citizens were forced to parade in celebration and petition the Japanese military for the suppression of bandits. All government organs, including the provincial government, require the approval of Japanese advisors for personnel and expenditures. The Japanese Autonomous Guidance Department has trained a group of running dogs and distributed them to various counties under the guise of autonomous guidance, but in reality, they are directly interfering in politics. All political affairs in the provincial capital are orchestrated by Ben Zhuang and Zhao Xinbo. The Education Department is planning to reinstate [a former system], with Wang Zhaofan internally appointed as the director. Textbooks will be changed to those used before 1924. Political expenses are extremely strained, and the Japanese military has seized the surplus from Yingkou salt for other uses. The Shenhai Railway is completely under Japanese influence. On the 7th, Zhao Xinbo initiated a memorial service for Yang Yuting at Qingyun Pavilion, attempting to buy off Yang's loyalists. (17th dispatch)</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Association Detains Paper and Arrests Editor</p>
<p>Newspaper Offices Request Protection from Authorities</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the arrival of goods, the issue of newspapers in Beiping has become a major problem. Western paper cannot arrive in the short term, and Chinese paper cannot meet the demand. Newspapers have no choice but to continue using Japanese goods in large quantities. Yesterday, the Anti-Japanese Association verified that the Shishi Baihua Bao (Facts Vernacular Newspaper) contained Japanese newspapers, arrested the editor, He Zhuoran, placed him in a wooden cage, and confiscated twenty pieces of paper. After negotiations by military and police authorities, the association released He, but the paper has not been returned. The association declared that it would destroy various newspapers separately. The authorities dispatched military and police to various newspaper offices for protection. Newspapers have organized a Newspaper Association Alliance to seek self-defense methods. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The dispute between the Anti-Japanese Association and the Shishi Baihua Bao has escalated.

Zhang immediately ordered military and police authorities to take strict measures to suppress all unconventional actions in order to maintain local security. (17th dispatch)</p>

<p>Declaration to the Kuomintang and the People of the Nation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Professors at Central University, in response to the Japanese occupation of Jinzhou, issued a declaration to the Kuomintang and the people of the nation, saying that China is entrusted to the entire Kuomintang and that the task of saving the country should not be put aside due to the lack of unity or illness of party leaders, nor should the national crisis be ignored under the pretext of the leaders not coming to Nanjing. Furthermore, the Republic of China, with its 400 million people, cannot be ruined simply because the Kuomintang leaders are not united or ill. The colleagues do not believe that national affairs cannot be handled without Chiang, Wang, and Hu. If there is truly no way to handle things, then the Kuomintang should hand over the power entrusted to it by the Chinese people so that the Chinese people can seek their own survival.

<h3 id="e28">The So-Called New Diplomatic Plan <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>News has come from Nanjing that the diplomatic authorities are about to propose a new diplomatic plan. There are three main points: 1. Sever diplomatic relations with Japan. 2. Ask the United States to convene a second Washington Conference. 3. Submit Article 16 of the Covenant to the League of Nations. After this statement was issued, there was much discussion in the secret meetings of the Legislative Yuan, which shows the seriousness of the problem. After the Northeast Incident occurred, how should our country respond in addition to non-resistance? Up to now, it is still in hesitation and silence. Perhaps today will sweep away the clouds and reveal the mask that has been shrouded for a long time?</p>
<p>We have repeatedly discussed the unreliability of the League of Nations, and it has long become a pierced paper tiger that cannot be poked again. Article 16 of the Covenant seems serious in wording, but the so-called economic severance and military preparations are in fact beyond the League of Nations’ ability to enforce strongly. Therefore, the second paragraph of Article 16 has already explained the responsibility of the League of Nations’ Executive Council, which is only to "advise" the member states. It is known in theory that it is extremely difficult to implement. Moreover, the three resolutions of the League of Nations are all sufficient to prove that various countries have no determination to use decisive measures. Therefore, even if Article 16 is proposed today, the result will not be hopeful. At most, it will create an atmosphere in the international community and delay the time.</p>
<p>The significance of asking the United States to convene a second Washington Conference lies in hoping that the United States will make further expressions after issuing a warning. The key to this further expression is not in the United States, but in the great powers. The attitude of the great powers towards this note was almost uniformly cold. And the content of Japan's reply to the United States was particularly comical. Under these circumstances, it is already known that it is impossible for the United States to convene a second Washington Conference.</p>
<p>Among the three proposals of the diplomatic authorities, the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan is the most serious. The meaning of "severance of diplomatic relations" is actually "the natural result of the entry into a formal state of war between the two countries" according to the views of general scholars of international law. Its announcement can be made before the war, as in the Spanish-American War in 1898 and the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. It can also be carried out simultaneously with the war, as in the Turkish-Italian War in 1911. Therefore, in principle, severance of diplomatic relations and the start of war are mutually reinforcing and cannot be forcibly separated. If someone advocates only severing diplomatic relations and not going to war, it is ignorant of the principles of international law and even more ignorant of the historical facts of international relations. As for how to deal with the lives and property of nationals in the enemy country and enemies in our country, as well as the notification to third countries, etc., these are also the articles that should be prepared after the severance of diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>Those who oppose the severance of diplomatic relations mostly focus on the interests of facts, saying that since the severance of diplomatic relations is mutually reinforcing with the state of war, what if our empty declaration is made but we ourselves have no preparations whatsoever? Those who support the severance of diplomatic relations mostly focus on the personality of the nation, saying that the September 18th Incident has been tolerated until now and is unbearable. There is only one strategy: "Better to be a shattered jade than an intact tile."</p>
<p>We have nothing to criticize about the severance of diplomatic relations in principle: 1. Although China and Japan have not declared war today, the actions of the Japanese army have long entered a state of war, but each still maintains embassies and diplomatic interaction, which is a rare strange example in the international community. 2. Japan is using this strange state to always claim internationally that the Sino-Japanese issue is not a war, that direct negotiations are hoped to be still possible, and that the Northeast issue is a local issue. Our side has no way to exonerate itself. 3. Since the Chinese people's economic severance of relations with Japan, the whole nation has supported it, shouting themselves hoarse. If it is not followed by a political severance of relations, then the upper and lower levels cannot be consistent. How can we unite to face the outside world? 4. This declaration of severance of relations can also give the countries of the world a strong stimulus. On the one hand, it warns the countries that the state between China and Japan has progressed to a very serious state. On the other hand, it forms a chain relationship when submitting Article 16 to the League of Nations. From now on, we can speak with confidence.</p>
<p>However, we believe that there are three major prerequisites for implementing this policy of severance of relations that must be effectively resolved: 1. The government should sincerely tell the entire nation that the government has made a great determination and encourage the people to rise up. 2. The government must immediately convene all military personnel on duty and decide on national defense in extraordinary times, and first struggle with the enemy on the front line outside the pass. 3. The people must cooperate closely with the government, and the costs of war, the supply of military needs, the maintenance of local order, and the expansion of the national salvation movement must be resolved and implemented in the shortest possible time. If the authorities do not have effective preparations and determination for these three major prerequisites, then the future after the severance of relations will be difficult to be optimistic about. If the government has a strong determination, it will use the national life and death as the issue.</p>

Ma Tingxian's brigade commander, Ma Rulong, was seriously injured and is still in fierce fighting. Huang Shuzu, the second regimental commander of the Lintan Tibetan soldiers, colluded with the Tibetan people, hoping to rebel. Yang Jiqing, the commander of the Tibetan soldiers, noticed and executed Huang on the 13th, and the local area is peaceful. The Political Maintenance Committee decided to issue a strict warrant for Ma Wenche's arrest as he had plundered public funds and left with a full load of spoils.

<p>(Tianjin) After the Committee Against Increased Tram Fares was destroyed by workers on the 14th, it stopped working. At 2:00 PM on the 17th, 300 to 400 workers gathered again in Zhongshan Park, organized a maintenance team, and went to the northeast city corner and the east gate at 4:00 PM, forcing tram passengers to get off the trams. The situation is serious. White-牌 and red-牌 trams stopped operating and entered the factory, while blue-牌 and yellow-牌 trams operated in the Japanese and French concessions. The security team and military police believed that the maintenance team's actions disrupted order and should be held responsible, so they took six representatives to the Public Security Bureau for questioning.

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Zongchang hosted the press at his private residence tonight and performed old dramas for entertainment. Zhang said that the national crisis is serious and it is heart-wrenching. Japan asked him to be the emperor in the three eastern provinces, but he vowed not to be a traitor and found a way to escape from Dalian and come to Ping as an ordinary citizen. The country raises millions of soldiers, but not a single shot is fired outside the industry, and tens of thousands of miles of land are lost. What is the use of this? He advocated abolishing the conscription system and implementing a militia system, because raising soldiers is not enough to resist insults, and maintaining public security does not require so many soldiers, which only wastes national funds. The factionalism is too deep, and private interests are too important, disregarding the country, resulting in the inability to unify and resist insults. He hopes that the press will uphold justice and fairness and attack those who have internal wars. If the country has no internal wars, he, Zhang Zongchang, can sell his old age and take back the three eastern provinces. Currently, one party rules the country, and party power is higher than everything else, but the country loses land, and no one takes responsibility. The rights are all in the party members, and the obligations are in the 400 million people. Can the world be regarded as public? He hopes that the national press will unify with the country as the premise and uphold justice and fairness. (17th special dispatch)</p>

Lü gave a speech, saying that his hosting of everyone was not to express political views. He took office as the Adjutant General this time because he felt that the national crisis was at hand and wanted to do his best to promote the party's sincere unity and overcome the national crisis together. The new government has been established for more than ten days, and there has been no political achievement, which is inevitable to disappoint the people, but national affairs cannot be achieved in the short term. Recently, all members of the Central Committee are focusing all their efforts to overcome this difficulty, and Chiang and Wang also intend to come to Beijing, and other military leaders, such as Feng Huanzhang and Li Delin, have also gathered in the capital to discuss national affairs together. There should be a new development in the political situation to meet the expectations of the people. Everyone is a leader in the intellectual community, and a pen is better than a Mauser gun.

We humbly request you to summon Xie An from Dongshan to create timely rain for the people and immediately enter Beijing to jointly deliberate on national policies. We soldiers are ready to fight.

<p>▲After arriving in Hangzhou, he immediately visited Chiang at Cheng Lu</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, a standing committee member of the Central Political Council, arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai at 6 PM on the 16th. He was accompanied by a foreign doctor and five staff members. The train arrived at Hangzhou Station at 10:50 PM. Those who came to welcome him included Song Ziwen, Lu Dipin, Lü Bichou, Chen Bulei, and a dozen others. Security was tight. Song Ziwen received Wang upon his disembarkation and walked out of the station. Wang was wearing a blue-gray silk robe and appeared relaxed with a slight smile, but his complexion was somewhat haggard. After leaving the station, he immediately took Civil Affairs Department car number 11 directly to Cheng Lu to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. They spoke in depth for more than two hours before he took the original car to the Xileng Hotel on the inner West Lake, where he stayed in rooms numbered 6 to 9. This morning (17th), reporters drove to visit, but the hotel refused to admit that Mr. Wang was staying there. After persistent questioning at his room, someone who appeared to be a staff member came out and firmly stated that he did not know Mr. Wang. It seems that Wang's trip is to avoid disturbances, so he does not easily see visitors. As for the delegation from Nanjing University urging Wang, Jiang, and Hu to go to Beijing, Chiang delegated Xu Shaodi, a standing committee member of the provincial party headquarters, to convey Chiang's views to the representatives of Jinling University at the Institute of Technology last night (16th). The representatives considered it satisfactory. Later, upon learning that Wang Jingwei had arrived in Hangzhou, the representatives felt it was unnecessary to go to Shanghai to urge him. Today (17th) at 2 PM, they sent Zhang Shude, Zhao Zhangfu, and Zhou Yintang to visit him, but they searched everywhere for Wang's residence without success. They are now planning to ask Xu Shaodi to introduce them to fulfill their purpose of seeking an audience and petitioning. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Qingdao Japanese Riot Subsides <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲Japanese Marines Have Withdrawn to Their Ships</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Lodges a Serious Protest with the Japanese Consul</p>
<p>Qingdao dispatch: Details of the Japanese riot in this city have been reported previously. It is now known that the Japanese expatriate community is divided into two factions: one is the propertied class, and the other is the property-less class. The propertied class, because of their property, does not want the incident to escalate. The property-less class greatly hopes that the matter will escalate in order to satisfy their ambition to seize fishing interests. Therefore, when the Resident Group held a meeting yesterday (13th), the two factions nearly came to blows due to differences of opinion. Finally, because the propertied class had a larger number of people, they won. Therefore, the situation yesterday suddenly eased. The Japanese Marines also returned from Qianhai Cliff to their respective ships at around 8 PM last night, leaving only eight soldiers stationed in the Resident Group and nine officers and soldiers stationed in the Japanese Consulate for protection. It is heard that the Japanese are scheduled to hold another expatriate assembly tomorrow (15th) to determine future policies and the attitude to be taken.</p>
<p>Regarding the "Min Guo Daily" publishing news of the attempted assassination of the Japanese Emperor, the Municipal Government has already apologized and ordered the newspaper to suspend publication for ten days. This matter has come to an end. As for the Japanese burning down the Municipal Party Headquarters and destroying the "Min Guo Daily," the Municipal Government has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Consulate, demanding: 1) Punishment of the perpetrators; 2) A formal apology from the Japanese Consul to the Municipal Government; 3) Compensation; 4) Assurance that similar incidents will not occur in the future. The Japanese Consul has not yet responded. As for the Japanese destroying the "Min Guo Daily," and because the newspaper was founded by the Party Headquarters, they set fire to the Municipal Party Headquarters, its momentum was fierce and the incident almost escalated. Therefore, people in the newspaper industry, on one hand, are intimidated by the arrogance of the Japanese, and on the other hand, they see that the government has no ability to protect them. Therefore, they dare not directly write about the recent actions of the Japanese. The newspapers founded by the Japanese took this opportunity to carry out large-scale counter-propaganda, even claiming that the destruction of the "Min Guo Daily" was done by Chinese students, and that the burning of the Municipal Party Headquarters had nothing to do with the Japanese, trying to cover up the truth from the world. In fact, when the Municipal Party Headquarters caught fire, Japanese thugs were all over the main roads, cutting off traffic and preventing fire brigades from going to put out the fire, as witnessed by Chinese and foreigners alike. Moreover, before this incident occurred, the Japanese expatriates held an emergency meeting. After the meeting passed a resolution, they dispatched thugs to carry it out. It was a planned and organized action. Moreover, the Municipal Party Headquarters is not far from the consulates of the United Kingdom and the United States. Before and after the fire, the consuls of various countries had received reports. European and American expatriates, fearing being affected, immediately convened a meeting at the International Club that evening to discuss preventive measures. The facts are all there. The Japanese may engage in major counter-propaganda, which only reveals their attempt to cover up the truth. (January 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Puyi's True Intentions <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲The Process of Gao You Tang Representing Chiang in Negotiations</p>
<p>▲Statements Before Being Abducted by Doihara</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Before Puyi was abducted by Doihara to Dalian, Chairman Chiang had sent Supervisory Committee member Gao You Tang as a representative to Tianjin to negotiate with Mr. Puyi. After the meeting, there were considerable results. Unfortunately, he was abducted by Doihara, which prevented the continuation of the negotiations. The details of the negotiations were discussed by Committee Member Gao You Tang yesterday. Although it is a thing of the past, it shows that Puyi's abduction to the east was completely against his free will. If a drama of enthronement and restoration is staged in the future, it can be determined that it is manipulated by the Japanese. The remarks of Mr. Gao are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"I (Gao Qun referring to himself) was ordered by Chairman Chiang to negotiate with Puyi. The outside world has different rumors, which are quite untrue. The reason why Chairman Chiang chose to send a representative was due to Puyi's various statements in the Tianjin newspapers and his large donations to various domestic floods and droughts. Chairman Chiang believed that Mr. Puyi was a patriotic person, and the previous rumors about Puyi's conspiracy to restore the throne were misunderstood. The Nationalist Party's nationalism is to integrate the five races into one family. Regardless of the national spirit of the Manchus, Mongols, Muslims, and Tibetans, if they support the Republic of China, the government should find ways to cooperate. At the same time, Tianjin intelligence also said that the Japanese were moving Puyi, but this was not the reason why Chairman Chiang sent someone to negotiate. He was still paying attention to Puyi's personality and intended to cooperate, not digging a well when thirsty. When I left, I met Chairman Chiang, and Chairman Chiang put forward five opinions: 1) Advise Puyi to move out of the Japanese Concession to avoid being used by the Japanese. The residence can be in Peiping or Shanghai. If you are not worried about domestic security, you are willing to move Ping and can live in Dongjiaomin Lane. The National Government purchases and allocates the old Russian embassy as a residence. If you are willing to move to Shanghai, there are many residences in the concession. You can purchase a building, and the treasury can pay for it. 2) If you sincerely support the Republic of China, the preferential conditions will still be restored. The old things will not be mentioned again. 3) The Qing Dynasty's expenses will be allocated on schedule. You can issue a guarantee that you will never break your promise. 4) Two Manchus can be added to the National Government Committee and five officials above the level of simplified appointment to participate in politics to protect the interests of the Republic of China. 5) In the future, no matter what kind of meeting, specific representatives of the Manchu ethnic group will be added, just like Mongolia and Tibet. During the conversation, Chairman Chiang's attitude was sincere. He completely regarded Puyi as a young man with thoughts and was willing to support him on the nation, and he planned to allocate 2 million yuan from the national government to set up four factories for the livelihood of the Eight Banners in Peiping. I came north at the end of October and met with Puyi and told him my intentions. Mr. Puyi first stated that the Japanese had moved him to the Northeast to become emperor more than once, but he ignored them. He also said that the Xinhai Revolution gave up power entirely for the sake of the public. How could he give up being the orthodox emperor and want to be a small court under the wings of the Japanese? The previous misunderstandings were all domestic matters. If brothers occasionally disagree, how can they cite a strong neighbor to bully their own country? Dare to clearly state that there is absolutely no possibility of being used by others. Even if he goes to the Northeast to be an emperor, at best, he will be like the Yi King of Korea, leaving a bad name for thousands of years. What glory is there? As for moving out of the Japanese Concession, it is not difficult to do, but it is doubtful whether Chinese law can protect it. For example, in the case of the tomb robbery, the stolen goods and the thieves were caught, but the special court had no way to deal with it. For example, the ancestral images in the Shouhuang Palace have been judged by the court to belong to the Qing Dynasty, but Li Shizeng refused to hand them over, and the court could not enforce it. All this is enough to prove that Chinese law cannot compete with strong forces. If one seeks shelter under the roof of foreigners, it is extremely dishonorable. However, at least Chinese law must be effective before residents can be protected by law. Therefore, living in the Japanese Concession is not desirable. The preferential treatment is unnecessary, because those who receive preferential treatment must be extremely incompetent, which is a shame for those who know. Personal opinion is that cooperation does not involve preferential treatment, and in recent years, my thinking has been more inclined to self-reliance. Therefore, I plan to study abroad, but because the expenses have not been settled and the foreign language is not fluent, it has been delayed. I immediately replied, 'I admire you for clearly stating that you will never be used by the Japanese. I can guarantee that the tomb robbery case will be resolved. If you want to go abroad, all problems can be solved, and the national government can also assist.' Mr. Puyi replied that he would consider it for five days and would definitely reply. During the conversation, the opinions were very close. I immediately resigned and went to Ping to meet Zaitao and told him the reason. Zaitao was willing to do his best to promote it and telegraphed the national government to state the negotiations. Later, I received a reply saying that there were concerns about the relocation, and a guarantee could be provided, and a telegram was sent to Vice Commander Zhang to assist in the matter. I was about to visit Vice Commander Zhang when I received a call from Zhu Guangmu, conveying Vice Commander Zhang's invitation to talk. So I went to Shuncheng Wangfu. After meeting, I learned that Zhang had also received a telegram from the national government at the same time, asking him to assist. Zhang meant that it was difficult for Puyi to move out of the Japanese Concession and move far away to Pinghu. Why not move to the French Concession in Tianjin immediately? Zhang also said, "Why is the central government so concerned about this matter?" I replied, "The League of Nations expressed dissatisfaction with Japan. The Japanese are helpless. If they use the name of Manchu self-determination to establish their independent country, and the Northeast is the homeland of the Manchus, even if the Japanese secretly manipulate and control it, it is not impossible to use it as a slogan. Moreover, after the European War, there are many cases of reviving nations and building their own countries, and the great powers cannot prohibit it. The central government's attention to this matter is to integrate the five races into one family, to avoid foreign use, and to prevent problems before they occur, which is really important." Zhang nodded and said, "Yes." When I received the Tianjin news, I came to Tianjin from Ping. I happened to be waiting at the station when the Tianjin disaster broke out. The military and police did not allow me to leave the station. After a long negotiation, I finally managed to reach the French Concession. At that time, the Japanese Concession had been wired and pedestrians were prohibited. Mr. Puyi's place was impenetrable. Within two days, Doihara had taken Mr. Puyi to Dalian. It is heard that Puyi is now living in Lushun, with only Chen Zheng and other four people on his side. The Japanese prohibit communication with the outside world. Even his wife's trip to Dalian went through many twists and turns before it was successful. Now they live in Dalian, separated from Lushun by a waterway, but the couple cannot meet each other. Other things can be imagined. If the imperial system is found in the Northeast, it is definitely not Puyi's free will, which is even more understandable. I met with Puyi twice before and after, and his conversation was quite fluent, and his pronunciation was also loud. Among the old princes, there are many who understand the big picture, Zaitao is one of them. A gentleman from the Peiping Banking Association also expressed his willingness to use the Pingjin banking community as a guarantee for the allocation of Puyi's funds, and his kindness was particularly touching. It can be seen that patriotism is fully expressed everywhere. I once asked Puyi if the conversation could be published. Puyi said that he has recently been studying Buddhist scriptures and does not care about fame and fortune. Please do not tell outsiders what he said, so I have never told the news media in detail about this matter to avoid publicity. Now that Puyi has become a puppet of the Japanese, his true intentions must be revealed, so I occasionally talk about it with friends recently."</p>
<h3 id="e68">Exhaustion of Military and Political Expenses in Hubei <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲The Pacification Headquarters Holds a Meeting to Discuss Maintaining Military Pay</p>
<p>▲Jiangsu and Shandong Agree to Host and Manage Production and Sales Tax Collection</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: The military pay of the troops stationed in Hubei is seriously in arrears. Even after reducing the amount paid, it is still difficult to maintain. The joint office of the various armies has repeatedly convened meetings to discuss solutions, and Pacification Commissioner of Hubei, He Chengjun, has been urging the Central Government to provide funds. Last month, Mr. He borrowed 600,000 yuan from the salt tax and unified tax bureaus to distribute to the armies to maintain food supplies and barely get through the New Year. At the beginning of this month, the heads of the various offices met again and decided to report the difficulties to the Ministry of Military Administration, requesting that the funds be distributed on time starting this year, and requesting that IOUs not be issued. However, half a month has passed (military pay is still not available. Now the various armies are planning to launch a large-scale campaign to suppress bandits, and military pay needs to be issued urgently. Therefore, the joint office of the various armies decided on the 16th to send Wang Qibo, Director of the Wuhan Military Academy Management Office, and Chen Daxun, Director of the 13th Division's Office in Hankou, to Beijing immediately to request the Ministry of Military Administration and the Ministry of Military Needs to allocate funds as soon as possible. At the same time, Ding Rusong, Director of the 51st Division's Office in Hankou, etc., were sent to see He Chengjun to ask for ways to maintain it. It is heard that He has submitted this case to the Pacification Headquarters to discuss solutions, which are generally still to maintain it by borrowing funds. As for the amount of the loan and where to borrow it from, it is difficult to find out due to the tight security. As for the political expenses of Hubei Province, it is also impossible to pay. Although the provincial government decided to borrow one month's rent and mortgage 800,000 yuan in cash, the owners' side cannot proceed immediately because the owners' public interest association has not yet been established and no one is responsible. Wu Guozhen, Director of the Department of Finance, has been running around in all directions for days, but he cannot borrow a penny. The state of his resignation being rejected can be imagined. Moreover, the production and sales tax to be held in Hubei Province has been proposed but not implemented. On the 16th, Chairman He of the Provincial Government received telegrams from Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, advocating the holding of production and sales taxes to provide subsidies and requesting to jointly submit a request to the central government. After receiving the telegram, He will consider it carefully and then reply to the telegram. (January 16th)</p>

<p>Prison Inmates Gambling Discovered by Police: The County Public Security Bureau recently received a report from a secret agent that there was gambling in a separate room of the Hua Hotel. The police were dispatched to notify Yin Bohua, the patrol officer of the first district, to go and arrest them. Three gambling criminals, Gao Youcai, Jin Ali, and Zhang Yizhou, were apprehended along with gambling tools and submitted to the General Bureau. According to the interrogation, Gao and Jin confessed that they were currently executing criminals, all of whom were sentenced to more than ten years for theft. Zhang Yizhou is a current guard at the prison. When the prison learned of this, it requested Magistrate Shen to telegram the Public Security Bureau to allow the prison to take back the two executed criminals and re-detain them. Only then were Gao and Jin sent back to the prison. Later, the county party headquarters learned that the Songjiang Hospital had been in charge of drug rehabilitation last year, and there were private escapes of criminals sent to the hospital for drug rehabilitation. The county government ordered the director of the hospital to be dismissed. Now, the county prison allows executing criminals to gamble in the hotel room, which is even more serious. They will question Magistrate Shen. I wonder how this case will be resolved.</p>

<p>Arson by Bandits Spreads to Civilian Houses: The area near Zhang Village, Hetoushang, in the Fifth District (Tianshang City) has always been frequented by bandits. Villagers are sleepless at night. At 2:30 AM the day before yesterday, the house of villager Yao Qiaojiao (also known as Little Monk) was suddenly set on fire by bandits, burning the house. For a time, the flames lit up the sky and could not be approached, spreading to the neighborhood. As a result, dozens of houses were burned to the ground, causing great losses. The next day, the neighbors thoroughly investigated the cause of the fire, but could not find out. However, after being negligent, Little Monk avoided meeting, which raised suspicions. After a detailed investigation, it was learned that Little Monk was suspected of arson.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Agency Selling Counterfeit Money: Liao Dajin, the leader of the detective team of the county police brigade, has learned that counterfeit money has been used in society recently, and various stores have suffered a lot. Therefore, he led detectives Zhang Zirui and others to investigate everywhere, and obtained an informant, Xu Yueqing, who secretly investigated in many ways. Finally, it was learned that an agency selling counterfeit money was located at Zou Zhixi's house, No. 2 Workshop, Three Rooms, opposite the Jiatai Silk Factory outside the East Gate. Team Leader Liao immediately took two yuan of foreign currency and gave it to the informant to buy from the agency. Sure enough, he bought two counterfeit five-yuan banknotes from the China-South Bank. Since Mr. Liao had solid evidence, he searched the premises and caught the main suspect, Zou Zhixi, and found a counterfeit ten-yuan banknote from a certain bank next to him. He immediately led the team and interrogated him severely. Zou Zhixi confessed that the counterfeit money was not made by him. He was entrusted by a friend to sell it in Wuxi. The counterfeiting agency was in Shanghai, and he was not the main culprit. The main culprit is now recuperating in a certain hospital, etc. After the team leader confirmed the confession, he prepared a document yesterday and submitted it to the brigade headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>Lu Jia's Residence Robbed and Injured: Lu Genbao, a resident of Lu Jia's Residence, Changshou Town, at the junction of Xicheng, is wealthy and has dozens of acres of fertile land. At 10 PM the day before yesterday, seven bandits suddenly came to Lu's house with guns, broke down the door, and carried out a robbery. They also kidnapped Genbao's eight-year-old grandson. At that time, Lu's son saw this and tried to step forward to take him back, but was stabbed heavily with a knife by the bandits. Afterwards, he reported to the district office, which reported to the Jiangyin County Government and the Public Security Bureau to request an arrest. At the same time, the injured were taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Robbery Case at Lu River Town Cracked, One Thief Arrested: Lu River Town, at the junction of Changtai, was robbed by bandits in October last year. Although the authorities ordered the arrest of the bandits in this case, there have been no clues to date. On the 14th of this month, Chen's tea house in Dongzhou City East Street, Tenth District of this county (near Lu River), suddenly came a guest from another province, about thirty years old. Local people, seeing that his behavior was suspicious, reported to the police team stationed in the town. Then, Sergeant Mei led the police to arrest the man. When asked, he said his name was Jiang Wulang, a native of Xiangyang, Hubei, and currently lived at Wang Xiaoyu's house in Beixin Zha. Then, the police were dispatched to arrest Wang together and escorted them to the general team headquarters for preliminary interrogation. Jiang was indeed related to the Lu River case and was sent to the county government for detention. Wang was released on bail by reliable shopkeepers after being certified by most local people.</p>

<p>Captains of Water and Land Police Teams Escorted to Province for Interrogation: According to a secret report from the Xiangmin of Dongxiang, this county's police team recently learned that Zhu Yuanchen, the detective leader of the water patrol team, was actually the son of the infamous bandit Zhu Xiaoba. Chen Lizhong, the captain of the Fourth Branch of the police stationed in San Duo Town, was also reported by detective Hua Wanting that Wei Mingshan, a detective of the water patrol team, was suspected of colluding with bandits. They were dispatched by the team to be arrested one after another. At Detective Zhu's home, they found two receipts for 150 yuan remitted from the Jieshou Post Office to Captain Xia, a handbag containing a wooden-cased gun, 33 bullets, more than a dozen secret documents from the water patrol team, and a complete set of smoking tools. After Captain Zhang briefly interrogated them, he sent them to the county government for interrogation and detention. It is now heard that the two captains of the police and water patrol teams have different opinions on this case, and both sides have filed lawsuits with the Civil Affairs Office. The office secretly ordered Cheng, the district chief of the Sixth District of the Guazhou Water Police, to bring his team to You Deng'an at 10 PM last night (14th). After that, he declared martial law, tightly closed the four city gates, and fired two shots to demonstrate. Then, Xia Yuanhu, the captain of the water patrol team, was arrested. This morning at 7:00 AM, he and Zhang Peifu, the captain of the police team, were escorted to the province for interrogation. The county government has now appointed Wang Qilin as acting captain of the police team and Li Weimin as acting captain of the water patrol team.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Shandong Education Expansion Plan <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲ Planning to add more than 100 junior high classes and more than 20 normal and commercial high school classes</p>
<p>▲ Adding a medical school and planning to add a junior high school</p>
<p>▲ Funding increased by 270,000 to 80,000 yuan compared to last year</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: Last year, the situation in Shandong was peaceful, education returned to normal, and schools at all levels were able to proceed according to the planned schedule. Now, at the beginning of the new year, the Department of Education is compiling an education expansion plan for the 21st year. Although it has not been completely finalized, it has been generally determined. The following is a summary: (1) Regarding senior high and normal schools, the number of junior high school graduates is increasing daily, and it is necessary to plan to add senior high classes to prepare for further education. Because senior high schools are located in Jinan, fearing that it would be inconvenient for students from other counties to study, senior high classes were specially attached to provincial middle schools in various counties last year. This year, the number of junior high school graduates in various places has increased, and it is necessary to add senior high classes to accommodate them. In the plan, the Provincial Fourth Middle School (Huimin), Fifth Middle School (Linyi), Sixth Middle School (Heze), and Eighth Middle School (Yantai) will each add two senior high classes. There are also many female middle school graduates. If it is convenient for them to study, adding a girls' senior high school would cost too much, so it was decided to add one senior class to the Jinan Provincial Girls' Middle School. It was also decided to increase the number of classes in rural normal schools. In addition to adding one class to the First Rural Normal School in Jinan, the five rural normal schools in Pingyuan, Huimin, Laiyang, Yanzhou, and Linyi will each add two classes. Post-secondary normal schools will also add classes, but the number has not yet been determined. (1) Regarding junior high schools, according to statistics from the Department of Education, more than 10,000 elementary school graduates in the province in the 20th year of the Republic of China. If half of them, 5,000, go on to further education, the existing number of junior high classes will not be able to accommodate them, and junior high classes should be expanded to meet the urgent need and avoid the congestion of last year. (Last year, all middle school entrance exams could not accommodate all applicants. Jinan No. 1 Middle School recruited 160 people, and more than 2,000 people applied.) Therefore, the Department of Education decided that in the 21st year, provincial junior high schools in the province must add at least 70 classes, and county and private junior high schools will also expand by more than 30 classes. (1) Regarding elementary schools, the Jinan Provincial First and Second Experimental Elementary Schools will increase the number of classes this year, and the Pingyuan and Huimin Rural Normal Schools will each have a central elementary school in each place (i.e., experimental elementary school). (1) Regarding the addition of new schools, it was previously passed by the provincial government meeting that in the 21st year, Shandong would establish a provincial medical school (recruiting senior high school graduates) and attach a hospital. The president has been appointed as Yin Xinong, and it is expected that the school principal will also be Yin (the hospital is separate). The funding is said to be more than 10,000 yuan per month. In addition, Shandong currently has 12 provincial middle schools, and it is planned to add another one, but the location has not yet been determined. In summary, Shandong plans to add one medical school in the 21st year (one junior high school has not been determined), add more than 100 junior high classes, eight middle school classes, 11 rural normal classes, and several post-secondary normal classes, a total of more than 20 classes. Experimental elementary schools will also add several classes. The required education funding will naturally increase. (In the 20th year, Shandong's recurring education expenses were more than 2.5 million yuan, and temporary expenses were more than 300,000 yuan, totaling more than 2.8 million yuan, so the funding for the 21st year will increase by about 270,000 to 80,000 yuan, totaling more than 3 million yuan. This budget is currently being compiled.</p>
<h3 id="e78">There is a Rumor of Changes in the Director of the Anhui Department of Education <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>▲ Han Anguang's promotion is considered promising as a successor</p>
<p>It has been more than a month since the central government issued a clear order appointing He Qigong as the director of the Anhui Department of Education. At first, the fellow villagers' organizations in various places outside Anhui Province strongly opposed his appointment. Then, the Anhui Education Research Association sent a telegram of opposition. He, considering the complex situation and financial difficulties in Anhui Province, has not assumed his new post for a long time. Now, the principals of secondary schools and the responsible personnel of social education institutions in Anhui Province have gathered in the capital to demand the issuance of outstanding payments from the Ministry of Finance. He feels that the situation is getting worse and has a strong intention to resign. It is heard that the central government, considering that the Anhui provincial government is about to be reorganized, will simultaneously select virtuous and capable people to avoid stagnation in education. Among the candidates for successor, the former director of the Anhui Department of Education, Han Angang, and Guang Sheng, etc., have the highest calls.</p>

<p>▲ The Medical School also expressed the same sentiment</p>
<p>After Zhu Jiahua resigned as president of Central University, for a month, there was no one in charge of the school. Professors organized a faculty meeting to preside over everything and planned to telegraph the standards for the successor president to the government for selection. Yesterday, Xu Peikun, dean of the Business School, specially convened an emergency meeting of all faculty and staff, and it was unanimously decided to retain Zhu Jiahao to return to school to resume his post. A letter was sent to the faculty meeting to solicit opinions. The general idea of the letter is as follows: Dear Sirs, since President Zhu resigned from the school, there has been no one in charge of administration, and funding has also reached a dead end. At this critical moment of survival, there is an urgent need to act. The colleagues of this college specially held a meeting today and agreed that the standards for the successor president set by the faculty meeting are complete and perfect. If a suitable person can be found, what more can be asked for? However, a new president is not easy to produce, and the Ministry of Education is at a loss. The fire is already burning, and relief is urgently needed. Rather than looking for a new person, it is better to seek the old one again. Since President Zhu served as president, his achievements have been remarkable, and he has the ability to handle funding matters. Now that the order of the head of the department has not been accepted, this school should welcome President Zhu back to the school in the name of all professors and ask the Executive Yuan to immediately withdraw the Ministry of Education's approval of President Zhu's resignation so that the foundation of the school can be stabilized and all kinds of difficulties can be solved. Therefore, we specially raise this proposal and ask your meeting to convene an emergency meeting and proceed to stabilize the overall situation as soon as possible. We are eagerly awaiting. It is also heard that the Medical School has expressed the same sentiment.</p>

<p>The Zhonghua Race Walking Association initiated a 13-mile long-distance race for men and a 2-mile race walk for women, which has been scheduled to be held simultaneously on February 21. It is learned that more than 40 people have registered with the association in the past week. However, there have also been quite a few misunderstandings due to the previous report that the 13-mile long-distance race walk was printed, and the association expresses its deep apologies for the mistake in the word "walk." Although the women's race walk is an initiative, the trainees are very enthusiastic. Several groups, including the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College, the Southeast Women's Physical Education College, the female employees of the Shanghai Bank, and the Female Examination Youth Association, have sent letters to the association requesting guidance. It is expected that the number of participants at that time will be considerable.</p>

<p>The performance of the Malayan team in the first half was superb and wonderfully original. The Interport team was almost dumbfounded, and the entire field was full of cheers. The situation was like a terrible storm, with surging tides. One wave was not flat, and another wave rose. The transitions were unpredictable, the military movements were rapid, and the eyes could not follow. The opponents were evenly matched, and it was amazing to watch. In the second half, the Interport team adopted an aggressive offensive strategy, and Malaya gradually returned to defense. Although there were also advances and retreats from time to time, it was not as dramatically changing as in the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Four Generals Lived Up to Their Mission <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The success of the Malayan team is undeniably due to the participation of the four generals of the Donghua Jinan Zhun Tu Liang Li on the front lines. Feng's composure, in cooperation with Yu, made the defensive line as strong as an iron wall. Tu's midfield, supplemented by Liang and Huang, added another solid defensive line. Huang was also satisfactory. With Li Yishen in charge of the center forward, the front line was revitalized, appearing and disappearing in the enemy's formation with great activity. The four generals of both sides also doubled their efforts, so each one was like a sea tiger, brave and invincible. Liu Jinrong's goalkeeping was also no less than Huang Jinbo's.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Five Tiger Generals Surrounded <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The ferocity of the Interport's five tigers is undeniable, so they adopted a strict defensive policy from the beginning, with each person responsible for defending one person. Tu Kaiyuan took Hui Sifalun, the two midfielders against the two inside forwards, Liang Shutang took Dai Linjing, Huang Kehou took Mo Lai, and the two wingers were defended by Feng and Yu, one step away. The defenses were strict. Sure enough, water and fire were incompatible, so the Interport's five tigers were frustrated, discouraged and returned. The forwards were under the left and right command of Li Yishen, with triangular movements, extremely sharp.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Head-on Collision Scoring Three Goals <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The three goals scored by Malaya first, the first to open the scoring was Li Yishen, followed by right winger Li Wenjie, and the third was left winger Yan Qisheng. The three goals were all clear, rapid and powerful shots, without any pretense, hitting the target with a crisp sound. The Interport's three goals were all due to a slight carelessness on the part of the defenders. Lietelei replaced Chen Zhenhe, which was not as good as breaking through, and Kaositai's midfielder was also mediocre.</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Momentum of the Malayan Team was Mighty <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Malaya kicked off, against the wind and against the day's advantage. Zhaxu sent the left wing from Mo Lai to the center forward. Mo Lai raised his foot and shot, flying over the goal. Malaya began to press forward. Li Yishen passed the ball to Yan Qisheng, who flew forward. Guan Xinde pushed to the right, a very good opportunity, but Li Wenjie could not catch up, which was a pity. Mo Lai came again, and Yu Zhuohua kicked it out. Malaya issued an order for a general attack again. Xie Jinfu caught the ball and flew to Yan Qisheng. Yan shot at the goal from a distance. Zhou Xianyan caught it, but Li Yishen came again in an instant. Ning cleared it out of bounds. The corner kick was very good. Li headed it but did not score. Liang Shutang rushed over and shot from a distance, but it went out of the goal. The momentum was strong and impressive. Li Yishen's performance was especially amazing.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Li Yishen's Amazing Shot <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Li Yishen was known to be a great general, but yesterday he suddenly showed his lifelong skills, charging left and right, commanding the advance and retreat, indescribably. Zhaxu was shocked and did not know what to do, and quickly added heavy defenses, but in the end, there was nothing he could do. Li Yishen opened the scoring with a cannon shot. The Interport besieged the goal but could not score. Kaositai fouled, and Tu Kaiyuan kicked a free kick in the middle line. Jie caught it and sent it to Li Wenjie's right corner. Although Zhou Xianyan blocked it, the right winger came again. Xie Jinfu hooked back and Li Yishen was one step faster, but one step slower, with no difference in speed, and shot into the goal, with applause like thunder, about fifteen minutes.</p>
<h3 id="e94">An Amazing Record of Three to Zero <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Malaya's momentum did not diminish. Xie Quanfu got Li Yishen's ball. There was no one in front of the goal. It would be a pity not to shoot. Although the Interport attacked fiercely and defended strictly, it still could not score. Liang Shutang intercepted the ball and sent it forward. Yan Qisheng passed to Li Yishen. Zhou Xianyan saw that the situation was very dangerous and rushed out of the goal. Li dodged and sent it to the right. Right winger Li Wenjie flew to the shot, Malaya actually dealt with the Interport team with two to zero. In less than ten minutes, Li Wenjie passed to Li Yishen in front of the goal. The ball was too fast and Li Yishen could not attack and shoot, which was a pity. Yan Qisheng caught up and shot, it was too fast to save. Malaya actually won two games, and the whole field cheered like crazy.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Sending Two Goals in a Blur <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Just as we were celebrating the victory, the Interport team secretly passed Chen Cang. Kankehan advanced on the right, passed from the right to the center, from the center to the right, and Mo Lai shot in the left corner, making the first half three to one. Switching goals to fight again, the Interport team kicked off. Once, Li Yishen and others advanced together. Guan Xinde did not shoot in front of the goal, so he missed the opportunity. The Interport then actively ordered a counterattack. Feng Yunyou drove east and west to rescue, and his hard work was commendable. The Interport repeatedly shot but did not score, and Malaya also got the ball and pressed forward. Shiduoke kicked it out. Huisifalun advanced on horseback, reaching the front of the goal. Yu Zhuohua wanted to let the goalkeeper kick it out, and Huishewo got to shoot, making it three to two.</p>
<h3 id="e96">A Satisfactory Ending of Three to Three <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Interport continued to attack non-stop. The situation was dangerous, and the entire line ordered strict defense to ensure victory. They advanced when they had the opportunity. The storms in front of the two goals were also endless, and the dangerous situation was amazing. Malaya was in a resting state due to the fierce battle in the previous game, and Li Yishen's foot was also injured. The Interport's pressure became even more intense. In the last eight minutes, Kankehan advanced directly on the right wing and passed to the front of the goal in the right corner. Dai Linjing hooked it back, and Lietelei ran over and shot it in, making it three to three, a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Malayan Team's Five-Match Record <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>

Although they lost the other four matches, it was regrettable that they couldn't show their true colors due to the cold weather. In March, with warm weather, we warmly welcome the Singaporean athletes to come again and show their skills. The five-match record is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e98">Last Week's Gold Price Trended Lower <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲ Changes Occurred Frequently</p>
<p>The gold market last week was unpredictable, with fluctuations of more than ten taels per day. The industry was indecisive. The beginning of the week was good, breaking through the 700 tael mark, but as large orders were withdrawn, it gradually weakened and fell for four consecutive days. By Friday, it suddenly dropped to 666.2 taels, which was indeed due to the unstable situation and public anger leading to market closures. The entire week saw a total decline of 34.8 taels. Near the end, there was a sign of recovery, rebounding to 680 taels, resulting in a total drop of 12.9 taels, a reaction from the four consecutive weeks of gains. On Saturday, due to the rollover, the forward rates were discounted by buyers, but the discount was limited to only 4 taels, with a maximum of 4.78 taels and a minimum of 1.78 taels. Major players like Baoyuan were willing to rollover their long positions, mainly because they had ample cash reserves and shipments from the north were arriving in Shanghai. In overseas silver markets, the trend was different: the British market contracted against the American market, and Shanghai's bill of exchange rate rose, while the domestic market tightened, which was actually affected by the surge in British and American exchange rates. The exchange rate of the US dollar, both official and unofficial, rose. Although there were no major news events abroad, there were issues like indemnity payments and proposals to raise silver prices, which were related to gold prices. Settlement prices were calculated in US dollars, ranging from 55 to 60 taels. Gold shops were actively trading in US dollars, and there were occasional squeezes. Arbitrageurs closed their positions at a profit of 30 taels. Guangbang Shen Da, etc., stepped in to close their previous short positions. The general situation of the past week is summarized below.</p>
<p>▲ A Drop of 12.9 Taels</p>

Unexpectedly, sellers became active and gradually lowered the price to 98 taels at noon, and 98.5 taels in the afternoon. Guangbang sold to arbitrage bills of exchange, closing at 96.7 taels, a large increase of 3.3 taels compared to last Saturday. The 'chiseled red' (tax) was increased by 10 taels because Yufeng Yong bought in. On Tuesday, the large order discount rose again to 0.125 to 0.0625, American silver remained unchanged, the shilling was the same, the US dollar tightened slightly, while the domestic market loosened, with more sellers than buyers.

Suddenly, it was learned that the stock market had stopped trading. Amid the turmoil, it immediately dropped to 84 taels, then closed at 6.5 taels. In the afternoon, it opened at 6.5 taels, but the ocean cents (taxes) increased sharply, and the market sentiment turned weak, plummeting to 82 taels, closing at 82.5 taels, a further small drop of 5.6 taels. The total difference for the day was 10.2 taels. The 'chiseled red' (tax) cent was increased by 8 taels.

In the afternoon, it opened at 82.5 taels, and due to heavy selling, it fell to 74.4 taels. Later, various parties repurchased and returned to an upward trend, closing at 78.6 taels, a decrease of 3.9 taels compared to the previous day. The 'chiseled red' (tax) increased from 8.5 taels to 11 taels. On Friday, the large order discount returned to 0.125, American silver increased by half a point, the shilling remained unchanged, the US dollar increased by half a yuan due to the surge in the exchange rate. The spot gold market initially decreased slightly by 1.6 taels, to 77 taels. At noon, there were more buyers, at 82.2 taels.

This was an exchange for March. The opening price for March was 69.5 taels, then from 71 taels to 66.2 taels, due to the rollover from 4.8 to 2 taels. Buyers were keen, and the exchange market also tightened, soaring. At noon, it was 81 taels, closing at 78.8 taels, with a fluctuation of 14.8 taels in half a day. The rollover closed at 1.7 taels, the 'chiseled red' (tax) was 9.5 taels. The high and low prices of British and American silver and bills of exchange are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Only Two Days of Trading in the Bond Market Last Week <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>▲ Due to Rumors of Suspended Payments... Auctions Suspended from Wednesday</p>
<p>The trading situation in the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market last week (from January 11th to 16th) was characterized by market instability. In reality, trading occurred only during the first two days of the week. Both spot and futures markets were quiet, with only sporadic transactions in various bonds. Major players were very cautious in their buying and selling. Total spot transactions amounted to 62,000 yuan, and futures transactions amounted to 10.07 million yuan. Transactions for the following bonds were: China Salt Tax (January term) - 1.525 million yuan, (February) - 520,000 yuan; Consolidated Tax (January) - 1.385 million yuan, (February) - 445,000 yuan; 20 Customs (January) - 1.3 million yuan, (February) - 360,000 yuan; 19 Customs (January) - 1.535 million yuan, (February) - 20,000 yuan; Nianjuan (January) - 660,000 yuan, (February) - 350,000 yuan; 19 Charity (January) - 700,000 yuan, (February) - 30,000 yuan; Disarmament (January) - 440,000 yuan, (February) - 45,000 yuan; Bianyi (January) - 410,000 yuan, (February) - 5,000 yuan; Zhengliu (January) - 155,000 yuan; Customs Tax (January) - 120,000 yuan; 96 (January) - 60,000 yuan, (February) - 5,000 yuan. Although prices remained weak on Monday, the trend was relatively peaceful, with slight increases for the 20 Customs and Salt Tax bonds of the current month. On Tuesday, market sentiment became more nervous, and the decline accelerated, with all prices falling uniformly. The trading range between the two days was approximately 2 yuan. Compared to the previous week, only the 20 Customs bond of the January term rose by 7 jiao, while most other bonds continued to fall by 1 to over 3 yuan. From Tuesday onwards, the overall situation became serious, with reports circulating from various provinces of tax revenues being withheld, and the government, facing financial difficulties, being forced to suspend payments of principal and interest on bonds. Although these rumors were unconfirmed, market sentiment became highly apprehensive. Silver and money industries and bondholders gathered to discuss countermeasures, and other industries also sent urgent telegrams requesting relief, as bond investments had truly spread across all sectors, with far-reaching connections. In light of the situation, the Exchange, for prudence's sake, announced on Wednesday morning a temporary suspension of new transactions. At the same time, brokers decided to suspend trading for two days. As the overall situation showed no improvement by Friday, it was decided to extend the suspension for another two days, awaiting news from the Ministry of Finance and whether various industries could find a solution to the problem, before deciding whether to reopen the market. Therefore, there has been no trading for four days, and the future of the bond market is not promising. The high and low prices and changes in market prices of various bonds during the two trading days of the past week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>▲ Sichuan and Guangdong Merchants Actively Stock Up</p>
<p>The yarn market was unusually gloomy last week, due to the increasingly severe Japanese aggression in the Northeast. The capture of Jinzhou caused discouragement, the securities market was suspended, and financing was extremely tight. As a result, the market was weak and unable to rally, with a significant risk of decline. Fortunately, there was a shortage of bottom goods in Sichuan, and purchasing in Shanghai was continuous, leading to the purchase of a considerable amount of yarn, reducing the inventory of local yarn. However, in recent times, the Japanese conducted secret operations very aggressively, with shipments from all directions. Some Japanese factories even cleared their goods at cost. The majority of spot yarn was sold off, and in light of the national crisis and tight credit, there was a unanimous trend to sell off. However, due to thin inventories and firm manufacturer sentiment, there were rumors of a squeeze on this month's contracts. According to reports, Rongxing bought over 7,000 bales, Yichang over 6,000 bales, and some sellers were manufacturers, with approximately several thousand bales scheduled for delivery. Given the situation in the business arena, a decline is unlikely in the short term, and it is difficult to predict how high the price will rise. The actions of the Sichuan and Guangdong merchants were truly significant this week, while other merchants were unremarkable. The price of spot yarn increased by 2.3 taels for this month, 1.5 taels for the middle month, and 0.8-0.9 taels for the distant months. A comparison table is as follows:</p>
<p>Man-Made Cotton: Highest / Lowest / Weekend Price / Compared to Previous Week</p>
<p>January: 154.7 / 152.1 / 154.5 / Up 2.30</p>
<p>February: 154.3 / 152.7 / 154.3 / Up 1.60</p>
<p>March: 155.0 / 153.2 / 155.0 / Up 1.60</p>
<p>April: 155.1 / 153.9 / 155.0 / Up 1.10</p>
<p>May: 155.0 / 154.2 / 154.9 / Up 0.90</p>

<h3 id="e103">Hubei Spot Cotton Stable Last Week <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>▲ Spot Consumption Extremely Sluggish</p>
<p>The cotton market generally fluctuated sideways last week, but in reality, there was a risk of decline. The American cotton market was flat, while the political turmoil in India was severe, but due to a lack of supplies from various sources, prices were difficult to lower. Therefore, buyers held on tightly, resulting in a situation where the market neither rose nor fell. However, it is widely expected that this month's contracts will enter the 30 tael range, as factories are unwilling to purchase local cotton. The spot cotton business has stalled, and prices from various regions have been trending downwards, once weakening to 30.085 taels. Midway, a Japanese merchant commissioned an Indian merchant to purchase several thousand dan for delivery to Japanese factories, causing the market to tighten suddenly, with prices across all months rebounding by 0.5-0.6 qian. The future situation of the cotton market is difficult to predict. When the Indian cotton market opened on the weekend, prices rose sharply by over 20 rupees. Tomorrow's spot cotton market may experience a volatile change. Compared to the previous week, spot cotton prices across all months rose by 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 qian. Actual sales were very weak this week, with only Shenxin making slight purchases. The price of American cotton rose by 20 pounds. The high and low prices of Hubei spot cotton for the week are compared in the table below:</p>
<p>Hubei Spot Cotton: Highest / Lowest / Weekend Price / Compared to Previous Week</p>
<p>January: 31.60 / 30.85 / 31.55 / Up 0.60</p>
<p>February: 32.10 / 31.35 / 32.05 / Up 0.55</p>
<p>March: 32.45 / 31.60 / 32.35 / Up 0.60</p>
<p>April: 32.60 / 31.80 / 32.55 / Up 0.60</p>
<p>May: 32.90 / 32.25 / 32.90 / Up 0.60</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was steady and firm due to buying by traders and good spot sales. Futures prices rose or fell by 1 to 6 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. British cotton futures were unchanged, and spot prices rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was firm due to short covering. Prices for both Pingguo and Aomula rose by 11.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 12.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated January 16):</p>

<p>▲ Yesterday, over 40 ships from Changzhou, Wuxi, Xianzi, and other groups arrived in Shanghai South. Shippers holding stock in the docks insist on price increases and are unwilling to sell. Furthermore, prices in production areas such as Changshu, Suzhou, Pingqing are approximately 0.5 yuan different from prices in Shanghai. Coupled with sunny weather and improved sales, the situation has become firmer. Early Han paddy on upper deck is most abundant, with prices increasing to nearly 1 jiao.</p>
<p>▲ There were only 37-38 ships at Xinzha. The local sales market was slower than the previous market. The price of Suzhou-Changzhou white glutinous rice on the upper deck, with nearly a thousand dan, remained unchanged. Kunshan rice is heavily stocked and sales are sluggish, with prices approximately 1 jiao lower. Early Bo rice is nominally fixed, while secondary soft rice is one to two jiao lower. There are no significant changes in Yangjian and Dujian rice, with a slight downward trend. The market will continue to strengthen if the weather turns cloudy and Yuan rice arrives. The amount of Hexia dried rice is about 3,000 piculs.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e106">Raw Sugar and White Sugar Markets Quiet and Steady <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, transactions in the sugar market were particularly sluggish. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar were bid at 9.7 qian, but buying interest was weak with bids at 9.6 qian, resulting in a stalemate. As a result, the back market had slight transactions at 9.65 qian. Dutch red sugar No. 9 was quite popular at 8.4 qian. Transactions in Taikoo Sugar's B mark were brisk, initially priced at 11.85 qian, then falling to 8.25 qian. Zhenjiang merchants absorbed hundreds of bags, and the market seemed firmer. HM mark remained at 11.45 qian, with limited transactions. In the trading market, there were slightly more than 23 packages of domestic Huanggang Qing opened at 7.9 qian. Because the goods were particularly good, demand remained strong.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3 id="e107">White Tung Oil in a Stable Process <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>For the past ten years, white tung oil has relied entirely on export sales. Since the sharp decline in overseas sales routes two years ago, the market has seen very few bright prospects. Recalling the market price three years ago, it was constantly above 30 taels, but in the past two or three years, it has been only 22-23 taels, and the total number of exports has also decreased from over 50,000 tons to 20,000 tons. For this reason, the ups and downs of the Hankou market are not as strong as before. Last year, the ups and downs did not exceed 3 taels. The decline in its momentum can be seen generally. According to recent details from Hankou, foreign firms are still purchasing, but each time it is only a few dozen tons, and the price has been fixed at slightly above 22 taels. Southern merchants have bid at 18.3-4 qian, and Sichuan tung oil is around 19 taels. The market is more than stable, but lacks sharpness, and there is no upward trend. Although local firms rely on Zhejiang and Hunan, they still rely on the Hankou market. In recent days, the Hangzhou firms have been selling special grey zhe at 30.46 yuan, but buyers are still unwilling, because the Hankou market is cheaper than before, and the Hangzhou market has not shown a drop in price. It is said that the reason why the Hangzhou market has not fallen is that the number of sales in the producing area has been high, the spot goods are very thin, and the price of seeds is difficult to drop, so the cost seems difficult to calculate. According to Jinhua, Lanhua, and other places, the cost of Xizhe boxed tung oil is 29.46 yuan, which is difficult to drop further when it arrives in Hangzhou. It is likely that it will pass the closing period in this stable state, and then the profit and loss will be determined.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and metal transactions were even quieter, but the British steel plate business suddenly opened with more than 2,000 dan. The buyer was a certain shipyard, but the market was mostly downstream. It was reported that 2.5% was priced at 8.25 qian, 5% was 6 taels, 7.5% was 5.2 qian, 1% was 4.95 qian, and thick pattern was sold at only 4.75 qian.</p>

<p>The words "Shanghai Citizens' Assembly" were written on a banner above the entrance. Inside, a signing table was set up for attendees to sign in. A high platform was set up in the center of the assembly, with the same words as the banner written on it. The order of the assembly was posted next to it. A press table was placed in front of the platform. Personnel from various organizations stood in the middle of the assembly, with hardly any space to move.</p>

<p>According to the New Voice Society, around 10 AM yesterday, the Shanghai Special City Workers' Movement Committee sent people carrying a large number of leaflets. Because some of the leaflets contained phrases such as "Eradicate the Chinese Communist Party" and "Down with the Communist Party," someone beat the leaflet distributors, causing temporary chaos. At the same time, a large number of leaflets were burned with fire next to the speaker's platform on the east side. The leaflet distributing workers were beaten and injured. A police officer from the Second District Police Station sent one of the seriously injured to the hospital by car. The other one returned home to treat himself. At that time, a police officer at the gate arrested one student who was carrying reactionary leaflets and detained him to be investigated by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. (According to a survey by the Daily News Agency, the injured person's name is Liu Shaoyan, and the detained person's name is Wang Hanqing.)</p>

Because after the violent Japanese forces forcibly occupied our three northeastern provinces, they continued to attack China relentlessly, resulting in the fall of Jinzhou and the crisis in Shanhaiguan. The government has not come up with any solutions so far. If we want to save the current crisis, we must rely on the power of the people. Compatriots, let us unite and arm ourselves to declare war on Japanese imperialism. Therefore, please express your opinions as much as possible so as to determine concrete policies and seek the survival of the Chinese nation."</p>
<h3 id="e118">Key Resolutions <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>

<h3 id="e119">Parade in Formation <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>After the adjournment of the meeting, it was already 12 o'clock. The masses who attended the meeting immediately organized themselves and set off for a parade, walking along Fangxie Road and Xietu Road, heading straight to the reactionary elements of the Municipal Government. Along the way, they sang The Internationale and shouted reactionary slogans. After reaching Fenglin Bridge, they first smashed the sign and police post in front of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. By this time, the municipal government had already closed the main gate tightly, and the Songhu Garrison Command sent a team to defend inside. Unable to enter, the masses gathered in the open space in front of the municipal government. At this time, the municipal government had already dispatched more than 60 Mauser squads and patrol cars from the Public Security Bureau, and the Garrison Command also added a platoon of infantry to guard the open space tightly.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Business Suspended <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>More than 100 stores in the Ximen Fangxie Road area, including Wannian Jewelry Store, Yuchang Store, Wanzuo Qiaji Brothers Store, Yifeng Hotel, Hengkang Xingji, Southern Company, Chunhe Foil Shop, Nantongtai, Mingxing Socks Factory, Li Bingji, and Rongchangxiang Coal Store, fearing that rioters would infiltrate and cause trouble during the citizens' assembly parade, closed their doors one after another starting at 12 o'clock yesterday morning and temporarily suspended business. It was not until 5 o'clock in the afternoon that they fully resumed operations.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Demand Release <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Because the Municipal Government's defense was tight, the masses who were parading in formation could not enter. They immediately sent 22 representatives to request a meeting with Mayor Wu to petition for the release of the masses arrested today. However, it happened to be Sunday, and no one in the Municipal Government was responsible for answering. Unable to get any results, it was already 4 o'clock. The entire crowd immediately convened a general meeting in the open space. The Anti-Japanese Associations of Jinan and Guanghua Universities were responsible for organizing a support association for the arrested comrades and decided to hold the first meeting at 24 Wuding Road at 6 PM today to discuss ways to rescue the arrested. After the meeting, they shouted various reactionary slogans again and continued to parade in formation.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Result of the Parade <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The masses left the Municipal Government at 4:20 and continued to parade and demonstrate along the same route. They originally intended to return to the Public Sports Ground to gather and disband, but because the gate of the Public Sports Ground was tightly closed and they could not enter, the mood of the masses became even more tense. They then all went to the Municipal Party Headquarters. Because it was a weekend, there was not a single person in the Party Headquarters, and the gate guard had also been withdrawn. The masses completely smashed the police post and glass windows at the entrance and broke several pieces of glass upstairs with stones. Until 4:30, about 200 people formed a team and walked along Minguo Road and turned into Nanyang Bridge, throwing away the red flag. When passing through Ximen, Shanghai public buses, seeing the masses coming again, stopped all the public buses on Penglai Road until 5 o'clock before resuming operation. The masses then returned to the French Concession from Nanyang Bridge, but only about 100 people passed through the Great World and walked along Hubei Road until North Zhejiang Road, where they completely dispersed.</p>

<p>Before the meeting, more than 30 female workers from the striking Xihua and other Japanese-owned yarn factories formed a fundraising team. Wearing white cloth on their chests and carrying bamboo tubes, they went to the Laoximen area to raise donations from shops and pedestrians. The response to donations was quite enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Sun Ke telegraphed Huang Hanliang and Lin Kanghou yesterday, saying, "Minister Huang Hanliang, Deputy Minister Lin Kanghou, Greetings. Your positions are crucial to the national finances. At this time of national crisis and financial instability, it is especially important for you to be conscientiously responsible. The government and its colleagues trust you as always. Please cancel your resignations and resume your duties immediately. Please also ask Brother Hanliang to come to Beijing to discuss the way forward. Sincerely, Sun Ke." Another telegram said, "Minister Huang Hanliang, and forward to Deputy Minister Lin Kanghou, Greetings. I trust that you received my telegram this morning. The Special Affairs Committee held a meeting this afternoon and unanimously decided to retain both of you. Please continue to be responsible and make every effort to proceed. Please also ask Brother Hanliang to come to Beijing tonight to discuss various matters. Sincerely, Sun Ke."</p>

<p>▲ Because Mayor Wu Went to Beijing and Has Not Returned</p>
<p>After Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and other leaders from all walks of life in the city consulted twice on the government's financial issues, they gradually approached an agreement. Yesterday, because Mayor Wu Tiecheng went to Beijing to ask for instructions and has not returned to Shanghai yet, and it was Sunday, neither side held any meetings. However, it was heard that representatives Zhang Gongquan, Li Fusun, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, and others held a meeting on their own around 9 PM last night. The results have not been announced yet.</p>

<p>▲ Appendix: Letter to the Elders, Brothers and Sisters of the Whole Country. Let the elders, brothers and sisters of the whole country know: For five years, the one-party dictatorship has been abusing people's wealth, reaching more than 200 million yuan. Talking about construction every day, even the waters of the rivers and seas have not been properly prevented and repaired, resulting in floods that have spread to 20 provinces, including Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang. The people have suffered disasters one after another, but there has never been a plan for thorough disaster relief. More than 2 million redundant soldiers have been raised, engaging in internal strife every day, and even the border defenses of the Northeast have not been consolidated, resulting in tens of millions of military equipment being entrusted to the enemy. Watching helplessly as the three provinces are reduced to iron hooves, daring not to add a single bullet to the Japanese soldiers, enduring the lonely army of Ma Zhanshan's bitter battles, and being forced to retreat without weapons or pay, but there has never been a plan for the entire resistance against the invaders. Recently, the central government has been reorganized, and the public believes that the party members may have a heart of repentance. However, it has been delayed again and again, waiting for one of the three standing committee members to come to the capital, but it is impossible. The suicidal policy of using public debt funds suddenly rings in the ears. Is this what is meant by political tutelage? Anyone with a little knowledge and a little blood will not accept this tutelage. Our people are regretting that they trusted the party too deeply in the past. Without representatives, how can taxes be paid? They also feel that there is no hope for the party in the future and they will become slaves of a subjugated country. How can they not ask about politics? From now on, the way for our people to strive for self-salvation is to raise brave soldiers for private fights and be timid for public battles. It is better for each of them to do their best to defend their local areas. Instead of paying taxes with obligations but without rights, it is better to exercise their right to supervise the government. It is deeply hoped that the financial circles of the whole country will awaken themselves quickly. If the government has the slightest behavior that disregards credit, it must not be easily subsidized, so as to avoid the danger of financial ruin. It is especially hoped that the taxpayers of the whole country will awaken themselves quickly. If there is the slightest expenditure that cannot be made public in the locality, it must not be easily recognized, so as to build a self-governing society on the spirit of every individual being responsible. As for the failure of diplomacy, it is entirely due to the chaos of internal affairs. If those who preside over internal affairs can truly consolidate the hearts of the people, then those who handle diplomacy will naturally be able to negotiate internationally. Our people repent of their conscience and have no choice but to promote the reflection of the Japanese warlords by not using Japanese goods. They should also encourage each other as fathers and brothers and persevere without slackening. Moreover, they should cry bitterly for the Japanese goods merchants and tell them to transfer their capital for selling Japanese goods to the cause of manufacturing domestic goods. In one shift, they can achieve both fame and fortune, and their bodies and minds can be complete. What is there to enjoy and not do to change the country's aspirations? The police issued a small notice, hoping that our people will rise up together to plan it. Jiangsu Provincial National Crisis Relief Association.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Municipal Party Department Urges Hu Hanmin to Go to Beijing <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Department, due to the urgency of the national crisis and the lack of responsible persons in the central government, telegraphed Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, and Chiang Kai-shek, urging them to go to Beijing to preside over the national salvation plan. Here is the text of the telegram to Hu Hanmin: "Mr. Hu Zhantang, Hong Kong, Greetings. Jinzhou has fallen, and Rehe and Hebei are shaken. The gentlemen of the new government, although they seem to have come with a plan and are fearless, have been in office for more than ten days and have not been able to come up with any solutions. Faced with this critical situation, only appealing like Qin Ting and weeping like prisoners of Chu can make up for the national affairs and help the reputation of the Party. Sir, you and Mr. Wang and Chiang have received the heavy trust of the Party and the country. You should be wary of the falling of the roof and the breaking of the rafters. Why do you cherish your feathers and refuse to come out, causing the criticism of the court and the public to be intertwined, and the Party affairs and national affairs to be more complicated? The Association, looking at the current situation, is filled with deep anxiety. In addition to telegraphing Mr. Wang and Chiang, urging them with great righteousness to go to Beijing to take responsibility, it also offers two sincere words to you, a general figure who is planning for the center of the situation and the key to governance. First, our Party is a group with a revolutionary history. In the past, under the leadership of the Premier, we risked danger and fought against the Qing government, imperialism, bureaucratic officials, and feudal forces. Anyone who benefited the country and the nation did not hesitate to risk their own lives to achieve it, so that we could gain a position in history and be loved by the majority of the people. After the death of the Premier, this heavy responsibility of leading the revolution has been placed on the shoulders of a few leaders of our Party by the Premier. Sir, you are a senior member of the comrades who have devoted themselves to the revolution, so you have a special responsibility to shoulder the arduous task. However, have you and others thought that you have fulfilled your responsibility of shouldering the arduous task? Can you still not hesitate to risk your own lives to seek the welfare of the Party, the country, and the nation? Taking our Party as an example, in the peaceful autumn in the country, there were still countless people who slandered our Party, saying that our Party's doctrine was ideal, and that our Party's political tutelage was a monopoly. Now that foreign aggression is imminent and the country is in danger of being destroyed, a few leaders of our Party who bear extraordinary responsibility, if they still deceive each other, fight each other, and do not think about uniting and facing the national crisis together, then the so-called ideal doctrine will become a deceptive fantasy, and the so-called monopoly of political tutelage will also become a situation of monopolizing but not doing anything. When the day comes when the Party is not like a Party and the country is not like a country, how can those like you escape the public criticism and the historical evaluation? This is the first reason why you, sir, should go to Beijing to take responsibility in terms of responsibility. Second, at the beginning of the Northeast Incident, the central government immediately asked you, sir, to take on the arduous task, and invited all the comrades to go to Beijing to discuss national affairs. Mr. Chiang also repeatedly stated that he was unwilling to abandon his responsibility during the national crisis and resign lightly. However, some comrades who were closely related to you in Guangzhou could not bear to serve the country and insisted on the proposal to resign. After Mr. Chiang repeatedly stated that he would never be greedy for power, Guangzhou then sent representatives to Shanghai to negotiate peace. It was heard that on the day the representatives arrived in Shanghai, you, sir, secretly instructed your relations to use the strategy of overthrowing the new warlords with Mr. Wang, and your subordinates used all kinds of methods to force Chiang to step down. In order to establish a new government and obtain your cooperation, Mr. Chiang immediately telegraphed his resignation, meaning that after stepping down, you and others would definitely put the national affairs first and immediately go to Beijing. Therefore, in keeping with his lifelong spirit of daring to take responsibility, he stayed in Beijing waiting for the car to arrive, but he did not want you and your subordinates to still be in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, and other places, shouting loudly, that he would never come to Beijing until he left Beijing. As a result, Mr. Chiang, in order to ensure the initial intention of uniting and resisting the invaders, did not want to obstruct the progress of uniting and resisting the invaders for his own sake, so he had no choice but to leave Beijing and return to his hometown after his resignation. Now that Mr. Chiang has been out of office for a month, what other reasons do you have for not going to Beijing to take responsibility? Mr. Chiang, although he has his shortcomings in his life, also has his strengths, and he is willing to take responsibility, which is his strength. You, sir, used your own personal resentment, not wanting him to take responsibility and forcing him to resign and leave Beijing. After Chiang resigned and left Beijing, you pushed back three or four times and refused to come to Beijing to take responsibility, causing the foreign aggression to become more urgent and the national affairs to become more wrong. I don't know what your intentions are. "If you are not good, overthrow you and let me do it well." This is the behavior of a man. "If you are not good, overthrow you and let me do it," this is still not the behavior of a great man. Otherwise, using the national affairs to sacrifice one's own personal resentment and not willing to do a little duty for the Party and the country, is this what a great man would do? This is the second reason why you, sir, should go to Beijing to take responsibility in terms of morality. The comrades have no grievances against you, sir, and no virtue to Mr. Chiang. As members of the Party, we put the Party and the country first, and we dare not fail to report what we think is dangerous. If you, sir, adopt our humble opinions and go to Beijing to meet the national crisis together, then we will be very fortunate. Telegram hurriedly, with extreme trepidation. Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>

<p>Recently, Jinzhou was lost, and the whole country was in panic. Retired military officer Feng Ganchen telegraphed the Central Party Department, the National Government, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that they do their best to resist the invaders and not be subdued by the violent Japanese forces. Here is the reply telegram from Minister Chen: "Mr. Feng Ganchen, 14 Qiu'an Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei, Shanghai, Greetings. I have received your telegram, and I am honored to receive your great righteousness and admonitions. Your patriotic enthusiasm overflows your words. After reading it, I am extremely admired. The government is very determined on the issue of Japan. I will do my best and strive hard, uphold the spirit of the revolution, and seek diplomatic victory, so as not to fail the heavy trust of our Party and the people of the country. I am writing this special reply, hoping that you will check it. Chen Youren."</p>

<h3 id="e133">Three Demands Telegram from the 26th Branch of the City Federation <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The 26th branch of the City Federation sent a "Three Demands" telegram yesterday, which reads:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram to the National Government: The national crisis is imminent, and the destruction of the nation is close at hand. The only one who can resist the brutal Japanese is General of the Black Province who firmly defends the border. No one else has been heard of. Fortunately, the Volunteer Army, which has risen up spontaneously, is resisting the Japanese army, but it lacks support and is difficult to sustain. The Association, aware that the demise of the country is imminent, requests the government to quickly decide on a national salvation plan: A. Immediately sever relations with Japan; B. Order Zhang Xueliang, the general who lost territory, to recover the lost land. If he continues to wait and see, he should be punished by national law to appease public anger. C. Rapidly mobilize and concentrate elite forces to prepare for national defense. D. Provide the Volunteer Army with guns and ammunition and encourage them to advance together to resist Japan. E. Implement revolutionary diplomacy and request all countries to respect the treaties and refute Japan's note on the open-door policy in Manchuria. The above points are urgent tasks for national salvation. We hope that the government will make a decisive decision and implement them without delay. We look forward to it anxiously.</p>
<p>(2) Telegram to the US Government: Your country is a civilized nation in the world, and diplomatic relations have always been cordial. You especially advocate world peace and have seen the notes in which China and Japan fulfill the treaties. We admire your fair and just position. The so-called justice will not perish, and the world still has hope. We hope that you will uphold justice and enforce the ironclad evidence of the treaties, and strictly refute Japan's unreasonable reply note, which claims to reaffirm the open-door policy in Manchuria, which is completely sophistry. The people of our country are filled with righteous indignation, and the seizure of our country's land is said to be legal, which is even more absurd. Its actions to destroy peace in East Asia violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact. We request your country to join the signatory countries and make a final fair claim to sanction the brutal Japan and strive for world peace. We earnestly pray.</p>
<p>(3) Telegram to the Jinzhou Volunteer Army: Your loyalty and courage to save the country are admired by the world. The righteous banner of your army stands tall. You do not hesitate to sacrifice your life for righteousness and serve the country. You embrace the responsibility of defending the country and uphold the spirit of fearlessness from beginning to end. This enhances the glory of our nation. We rely on your army to continue to strive to annihilate the brutal enemy, remove the obstacles to world peace, and fight for the happiness of national survival. This Association pledges to be your backing.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Continued Receipt of Telegrams from the City Chamber of Commerce Opposing the Suspension of Payment of Principal and Interest on Public Bonds <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and other organizations in this city received two telegrams from Tianjin yesterday opposing the suspension of payment of principal and interest on public bonds. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To the City Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and the Money Trade Association: It is noted that the government has news of suspending the payment of principal and interest on domestic debt. If true, it will plunge the national finance into bankruptcy and the livelihood of the entire people into desperation. The foundation of the country is at stake. How can we allow it to be shaken even slightly? In addition to separately writing to the Ministry of Finance and the Domestic Debt Fund Custody Committee to strongly argue against it, this Association pledges to follow you all as a backing. Tianjin City Chamber of Commerce, bowed and filed.</p>
<p>(2) To the City Chamber of Commerce, the Domestic Debt Fund Custody Committee, the Bankers' Association, and the Money Trade Association: It is noted that there is a proposal to suspend the payment of principal and interest on domestic debt. If this measure is true, the damage will be so great as to plunge the livelihood of the entire people into desperation. Fortunately, your Association has protested first. This Association is willing to cooperate and unite to be a backing. Respectfully telegraphed to you for your information. Tianjin Money Trade Association, bowed and filed, deleted.</p>
<h3 id="e135">National Association for Local Autonomy <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲Scheduled to convene the third annual conference</p>
<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Local Autonomy is a formal organization established by representatives elected by local autonomy advancement associations of various provinces, circuits, counties, and cities, in accordance with the law, to assist the government in carrying out local autonomy. Since the first conference was held in Nanjing and the second conference was held in Hangzhou, it happened to be the time of the rise of the revolutionary army. The people of the whole country are devoted to eliminating warlords and hoping to build the foundation of democratic politics, so the association affairs were temporarily suspended. Recently, the president of the association, Chu Huiseng, the general affairs minister, Wu Xiaohou, the Shanghai-based director, Shen Tianxin, the Jiangsu provincial association president, Pang Tiejie, and other important figures gathered in Shanghai to discuss. They all agreed that since the sixteenth year, internal chaos has continued, and there is still no sign of democratic politics. In addition, the banditry is becoming increasingly urgent, and foreign insults are coming one after another. The people are suffering even more than in the past. If we want to extend civil rights and seek self-salvation, there is no other way but to implement local autonomy. After separately soliciting the opinions of important figures from various temples, they all believe that the association has an unshirkable responsibility to promote local autonomy. It was decided to continue the development of local autonomy throughout the country with the spirit of the past, and to convene the third conference in Shanghai on February 21, and to temporarily set up an office at No. 13, Lianzhu Lane, Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai. In addition to publishing notices of the convening in major newspapers in Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other four cities, separate letters were sent to local autonomy advancement associations in various places, inviting them to send representatives to attend the conference. Local autonomy enthusiasts from all over are also welcome to actively join the association so that they can gather ideas and work together to promote progress.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Flourishing Business of the Zhabei National Products Exhibition <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>▲Reaching 40,000 Yuan per day</p>
<p>▲Extending business hours</p>
<p>The third National Products Exhibition in Zhabei, organized by the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products, officially opened on the sixteenth day after the opening was announced on the fifteenth day. The business is quite prosperous. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Exhibition Hall Arrangement: The exhibition hall is located on the square in front of the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce. It is built with Western-style bungalows, divided into eighty-four booths. Silk fabrics, cotton cloth, knitwear, woolen fabrics, and cotton fabrics each occupy four booths. Woolen cloth, copperware, combs, woolen hats, electrical appliances, and leather goods each occupy two booths. Food, glassware, jewelry, MSG, tea, enamelware, steel beds, paintbrushes, toothbrushes, paint, candles, soap, oil lamps, and toys each occupy one booth. The layout is elegant, economical, and beautiful.</p>
<p>▲Authorities Maintain Order: The Fourth District Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Zhabei Security Regiment, and the Detective Team dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order at the exhibition hall. A fire brigade of the Zhabei Fire Brigade carried a fire engine and four fire extinguishers to station at the exhibition hall for fire prevention. The authorities' maintenance of national products can be described as extremely complete.</p>
<p>▲Prosperous Business: The staff of the association are energetic and treat guests with humility and kindness, so guests feel at home. On the first day after the opening (the sixteenth day), the total business revenue of the entire exhibition hall reached more than 38,640 yuan. Among them, cotton textiles and winter supplies sold best, and the business of Wei Shunji Toy Factory was also very prosperous. According to Chen Binghui, the standing committee member of the exhibition hall, this achievement is rare in the history of exhibitions and is enough to show the citizens' growing enthusiasm for promoting national products.</p>
<p>▲Extending Business Hours: The original business hours of the association were from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm. However, the majority of residents and workers in Zhabei are workers from nearby factories who do not have time to go to the exhibition hall to shop after work in the evening. They have requested to extend the business hours. The association, in response to their request, has changed the daily business hours from 10:00 am to 8:30 pm starting today (the eighteenth day).</p>
<p>▲Publishing a Declaration: In order to awaken the citizens to promote national products consistently, the propaganda department of the association, in addition to hanging bamboo cloth slogans on the main roads of the Chinese Concession, also published a declaration and distributed it to guests from all walks of life to spread the word.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Seventeen Trade Associations Request the Establishment of a Chamber of Commerce Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>▲Responsible for handling matters related to boycotting goods</p>
<p>▲Establishing inspection teams to implement inspections</p>
<p>Seventeen trade associations in this city, including the brick and tile industry, seafood and groceries industry, seafood store industry, sugar industry, local products industry, electrical appliance industry, southern goods industry, jute bag industry, yarn industry, fly ash industry, northern and southern goods exchange industry, cotton cloth industry, silk fabric industry, new drug industry, color printing industry, sausage industry, and ginseng and velvet industry, jointly sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce, stating: We believe that the boycott of Japanese goods is closely related to commercial tools and should be carried out automatically and strictly by our merchants and people in order to achieve a thorough solution. Since the September 18th Incident, your association has organized a committee to implement economic severance with Japan this month, but its strength is very weak, which has led to others overstepping their authority and causing repeated disputes. In addition to suffering various losses, each industry has suffered the pain of being devastated and oppressed. Considering that your association leads the merchants and speaks out for justice, now is the time, and it is your responsibility not to sit idly by. We hereby jointly request your association to reorganize the Committee for Implementing Economic Severance with Japan into a Chamber of Commerce Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, gather talent, strengthen its strength, and be responsible for handling various matters related to boycotting goods. Establish an inspection team to implement inspections, cooperate with anti-Japanese national salvation associations from all walks of life, and achieve the same goal through different approaches. This will not only be parallel and not contradictory, but also complement each other. Please investigate and handle it quickly and reply. Sincerely, to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>▲After the formal establishment of the Staff Union of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this city, it held its first meeting the day before yesterday and specially submitted a document to the executive committee of the association yesterday regarding the layoff issue. The document stated: We respectfully submit this document for consideration. Since your association announced the resolution to lay off staff, comrades from various departments have sent representatives to your association to inquire about the reason for the layoffs. Later, Wang Xiaoyan and other committee members invited the representatives to a banquet at Hangzhou Restaurant and instructed them that the motivation for the layoffs was due to a lack of funds and promised to propose appropriate solutions to your association. After hearing this news, comrades from various departments continued to work as usual and awaited the decision of your association. Unexpectedly, at the meeting of the Native Place Association on the eleventh, Wu Mai publicly insulted our staff from various departments and proposed to dismiss all of them and have staff from various departments be filled by the relevant trade associations. The news spread and was extremely shocking. Our comrades from various departments came for the sake of patriotism, but now they have been insulted, which is not in accordance with the law or reason. Moreover, the proposals to dismiss staff and have them filled by trade associations are both contrary to the original intention of patriotism. Therefore, comrades from various departments of this association convened a plenary meeting yesterday and unanimously stated that your association suddenly decided to lay off staff and then proposed to dismiss them and have them filled by trade associations. The reasons for this are nothing more than a lack of funds and a reduction in workload. However, it is rumored that the fine money decided by your association is more than 200,000, but only 70,000 to 80,000 have been received. Now, instead of collecting the fine money, you are laying off staff due to a lack of funds. We really don't know what your association is thinking. (Omitted) Furthermore, the proposal to have staff from various departments of this association be filled by trade associations is absurd and unreasonable. The Anti-Japanese Association is organized by all the citizens, how can it be monopolized by biased elements? Although there are indeed trade associations that can fully assist this association in its anti-Japanese work, there are also many who protect unscrupulous merchants and use deceptive words. If it is once taken over by such people, the future of anti-Japanese resistance is unimaginable. If your association has such a resolution, please revoke it, otherwise it may cause a backlash from all the citizens and cause great anxiety. Comrades from various departments have summarized the reasons and decided on the following conclusions: (1) Request your association to publicize the accounts to clarify whether there is a lack of funds. (2) Request the committee members to attend the association daily to expedite the handling of matters. (3) Request the committee members to solemnly sign and approve documents to convince the public, so that the staff can work diligently. (4) Re-establish the rules for rewarding secret reports to maintain credibility. (5) When staff are oppressed outside, your association should provide full assistance to encourage them. (6) Revoke the resolutions to dismiss staff and have staff from various departments be filled by trade associations. We hope that the above points will be answered within three days to reassure the public and avoid disputes. This would be a great favor.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Workers of the Rihua Factory Held a Discussion Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>More than 100 representatives of workers from the Rihua Yarn Factory held a discussion meeting at the preparatory committee of the Yarn Factory Union in the West District yesterday afternoon. Du Yushan was publicly elected as the chairman and immediately reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that all the workers of Rihua are suffering from the destruction and oppression of Japanese capitalists every day, and the reason for this is that we are not united and have no legal protection, which allows the capitalists to arbitrarily destroy us and do whatever they want. This time, the dismissal of workers and the cancellation of monthly bonuses and rice subsidies for no reason caused the Tongxing and other factories to go on strike one after another, demanding that the capitalists restore the original treatment. Although the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to mediate, the capitalists insisted on their original proposal and made no concessions, and their cruel oppression can be imagined. However, if we workers continue to endure this, if we do not seek remedies, the consequences will be dire. Therefore, we have invited representatives of all brothers and sisters to come here to discuss countermeasures together so that all workers can obtain considerable benefits. Then the discussion began, and the main points were as follows: (1) Organize a union to unite. It was resolved to proceed with the organization immediately. (2) The progress of this meeting should determine several preparatory committee members to be responsible for handling matters. It was resolved to nominate Du Yushan, Huang Bao, Shan, and others to be members of the preparatory committee. (3) All unemployed and employed workers should register to facilitate the process. It was resolved to pass it. (4) Notify workers from various Japanese yarn factories to unite and seek countermeasures together. (5) Demand that the capitalists revoke the previous proposal. It was resolved not to give up until the goal is achieved. (6) Strictly prevent saboteurs from undermining the labor movement. It was resolved that all workers should act in accordance with the law. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Ministry of Finance's Reply to the Request of the Property Management Office to Exempt Additional Grain Tax <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>▲Initially, the extension was not approved</p>
<p>▲Later, it was said that it could be done</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Property Management Office requested that the additional winter grain tax be exempted, and the request was submitted to the Ministry of Finance of the National Government to quickly cancel the additional two yuan to alleviate the people's difficulties. The news has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, a directive from the Ministry of Finance was received, stating that after reviewing the case file, the request to exempt the additional two yuan of grain tax has been noted. The case of Jiangsu extending the additional grain tax for one year was approved by the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan in April of the 20th year, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government was instructed to submit the proposal to extend the additional two yuan of grain tax from the 19th year for one year in the budget plan for the 20th year. The Ministry has listed the reasons why the extension could not be approved and requested to maintain the original proposal. Later, a letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan was approved and sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to continue to submit the proposal to extend the additional two yuan of grain tax for one year. Since this case has been submitted by the Jiangsu Provincial Government together, and it is now during the period of bandit suppression, it seems that it can still be handled. However, the land tax in Jiangsu Province has always been heavy. In addition to the regular tax, there are additional taxes. During this one-year extension period, the counties must not add any additional taxes under the male tax item. After the expiration, the provincial government must not request to extend it again under any name, so that the provincial treasury and the people's difficulties can be taken care of on both sides. The letter was replied and forwarded. Subsequently, an order from the Executive Yuan was issued and the National Government was ordered to approve the record. The Ministry then ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to comply with the case. You should be informed that the county has submitted the number of scores determined by the autumn survey in the 20th year, and you should also wait for the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to verify it.</p>

<p>▲ New ships to launch in May</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Danish Maersk Line, one of the world's most famous shipping companies, with 43 ships and routes spanning the seven seas, is managed in this city by East Asiatic Company. Since the opening of the Far East-North America route in March of last year, business has been excellent. Several weeks ago, the company's owner, Mr. Møller, visited Shanghai for inspection and decided to add five newly built oil-burning giant ships to the Pacific route. The new ships will launch by the end of May, with one sailing each month thereafter, traveling between New York and the Far East. The ships will stop at New York, Hampton Roads, Savannah, the Panama Canal, San Pedro, Yokohama, Kobe, Shanghai, Qingdao, Manila, Iloilo, and Makassar. The new ships have a speed of 15 miles per hour, requiring only 21 days from the Far East to Los Angeles, and 38 days to New York, making them truly fast ships on the Pacific. Each ship can carry 18 to 20 passengers, with extremely comfortable and perfect facilities, and especially exquisite cuisine, as the Danes are known for their culinary skills, even surpassing French cuisine.

<p>▲ Due to Difficulty Maintaining a Livelihood</p>
<p>▲ A Most Tragic Scene</p>
<p>Xu Jinmei, a local resident aged 65 who worked as a laborer for the Changxing Shipping Company at 4 Wuma Road, has been out of work for more than six months. His eldest son, Yongnian, aged 31, who used to work for Changxing and other firms, has also been laid off for seven months. His youngest son, Yonghuan, aged 26, works as a chauffeur for the Xinchang Transportation Company at Tianfei Palace Bridge, earning only a few dozen yuan per month. The entire family relies on him to make ends meet, but it is difficult to support them, leading to mounting debts. Xu and his eldest son, Yongnian, considered the situation and saw no way out. As a result, they both decided that it would be better to leave this world early to reduce Yonghuan's burden. So, they resolved to commit suicide. Yesterday morning, the father and son purchased opium paste. Soon after, they both became poisoned and were beyond help. Their youngest son, Yonghuan, rushed them to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that they ingested too much poison, and their lives are in danger.</p>

<p>▲ Three Shots Fired, Luckily None Hit</p>
<p>Gu Lanzhou, a farmer residing at 11 Yanjia Bridge, Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai, is 45 years old and comes from a well-to-do family. He has two sons, Baogen, 25, and Amao, 20, both of whom are married. Last spring, all the family property was divided into three shares by the local village head Chen Yixiang (one share for Lanzhou and his wife, and one share each for Baogen and Amao), and each established their own household. However, Baogen did not engage in proper work and spent his time wandering around. Lanzhou repeatedly admonished him, but to no avail. As a result, the property he received was sold off within two years. Yesterday afternoon around 4 p.m., Baogen forcibly demanded land deeds from his father but was refused. He pulled out a gun and fired three shots at his father, but luckily none hit. Lanzhou was terrified and cried for help. Neighbors heard the cries and came to the rescue, saving him from danger. He then reported the incident to the Chengjia Bridge Police Station. Police Chief Lu Peiyu received the report and personally led officers to arrest the undutiful son Gu Baogen and escort him to the First Sub-bureau of the Sixth District. However, the handgun had already been discarded and could not be found.

<p>▲ Otherwise, They Will Be Considered as Failing to Affix Stamp Tax</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various trade associations stating that the Rice Trade Association had reported that Longxingtai was fined for failing to affix stamp tax on an invoice, and requested that the fine be revoked. The letter stated that the invoices in question, when inspected by the designated personnel, all indicated the price of the goods, the brand of the recipient, and were stamped with the store's seal. However, they did not include the year above the month and day. The phrase "last year" was considered definitive proof of the year. The bureau has found that invoices without the year are common in all industries and are inevitably used as a way to avoid stamp tax. To prevent people from evading tax and to avoid setting a precedent for others to follow, the bureau had no choice but to impose a discretionary fine. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce should inform all businesses that when issuing invoices and receipts, they must not change the format and must include the year for easy identification during inspections. If anyone deliberately tries to be cunning and is caught, it will be considered tax evasion and no exceptions will be made.</p>

<p>▲ Twelve-Year-Old Boy Seriously Injured</p>
<p>The Yingfeng Rice Store at 160 Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, owned by Mr. Zhi Xu (30 years old) from Yangzhou, was doing a decent business. Recently, to save money, they sublet the kitchen shed at the back to a Mr. Su from Funing. Su then sublet it to Guo Zhenxiang from Yancheng, who made firecrackers at a thatched house on Guangzhao Road, as a place to store goods. Unexpectedly, at 0:10 a.m. yesterday, Guo was careless when moving the firecrackers, and they suddenly collapsed, pressing on the gunpowder placed nearby. A deafening explosion occurred, shaking the building, and the kitchen shed collapsed instantly. Guo was caught in the blast, his face was severely burned, and he lost his sight. At the same time, a twelve-year-old boy named Da Maozi, son of Mr. Su, also suffered severe head injuries. After the accident, police officers Wang Yuanji and Shi Yunpeng from posts 67 in the 2nd sub-district of the 4th district, rushed to the scene upon hearing the explosion. They managed to send the injured Guo Zhenxiang and the boy Da Maozi to the hospital for treatment, and took Mr. Zhi Xu into custody. After questioning him, Chief He deemed it a case of injury and sent him to the bureau for further investigation. It is reported that Guo's injuries are severe, and although his life is not in danger, he may become disabled. It is also reported that Mr. Su has fled and is being pursued by the police.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Three Puppets, Two Jars of Water <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>▲ Used as Tools for Extorting Money</p>
<p>▲ Arrested and Sent for Investigation</p>
<p>Shen Jinfu, the owner of a certain carriage shop at 295 Meibai Ge Road, recently came up with an unconventional idea. He gathered Gao Hanqing and women Shen Yinshi and Wu Shenshi, and set up three puppets and two jars of water in the carriage shop. Shen Jinfu also claimed that the gods would take turns possessing him, and that when possessed, all requests would be granted without fail. As a result, foolish men and women who believed in divine power went to seek divine guidance and fortune-telling. Over time, the number of seekers increased, and the place became as busy as a marketplace. Seeing that this method of extorting money was very easy, Shen and others stipulated that the time for divine possession would be from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. daily, and they would not receive anyone after the deadline. They charged one corner for those seeking divine guidance and two yuan for those seeking a divine child. As a result, the flow of people seeking wealth was overwhelming. The police learned about this and, considering it to be fraud under the guise of divine power and a violation of the prohibition order, sent undercover agents disguised as those seeking divination to investigate. After confirming the facts, Luo Biesheng, the Western Detective Chief of the Xinzha Police Station, led detectives to the location, arrested Shen, Gao, and the two women, and sent them to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Shang Feng reviewed the case, and the police lawyer Qian Mingchen clarified the circumstances of the case, requesting that they be charged with inciting and defrauding. Judge Cheng then questioned each of the defendants one by one, ordered Shen and Gao to be detained, and released the two women on bail, pending further investigation. The puppets were immediately destroyed.</p>

<p>▲ Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment After Interrogation</p>
<p>Ma Qin, a Cantonese native, worked as a partner in a jewelry store owned by his fellow townsman Beng Chongshan at 986 Wusong Road. On the morning of the 7th of this month, he was entrusted by Cai to have a diamond ring worth 300 yuan remade. Ma, who had recently become addicted to gambling and was heavily in debt, had a greedy impulse when he saw the valuable item. He secretly took it out and pawned it at the Baohe Pawnshop at 1338 North Sichuan Road for 110 yuan, going to a gambling den for a desperate gamble. However, his luck ran out, and he quickly lost everything. Unable to make amends, he sent a letter to Cai, saying that he would temporarily return to his hometown to find a way to repay the debt. Cai, suspecting that he would not return and was hiding in Shanghai, reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station. The Cantonese detectives Feng Qi and He Ruirui were patrolling North Sichuan Road on the evening of the 10th when they recognized Ma walking with his head down. They immediately arrested him and brought him to the police station. They found the original pawn ticket during the search and notified Cai to redeem the ring from the pawnshop. The next morning, they escorted Ma to the First Special Committee's First Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant Ma Qin had falsely accused residents of theft, hoping to get a reward. He presented the recovered ring and the letter to the court for investigation. Cai Chongshan then testified to the circumstances of the case. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had been momentarily confused and pawned the diamond ring in the gambling den and lost. He pleaded for leniency. Judge Xiao Xiefen reviewed the confession and sentenced Ma Qin to six months imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>▲ Chen A'si's Deceit is Excessive</p>
<p>▲ Sentenced to Four Months Imprisonment After Interrogation</p>
<p>At 9:30 a.m. on the 15th of this month, the Wang family at 254 Donghan Bile Road was robbed of valuables worth several hundred yuan, and the thieves left without a trace. At 8 p.m., Chen A'si, a native of Yangzhou, reported to Chinese detective Li Hongsheng of the Huishan Police Station that the robbers were drinking tea at a small teahouse on Yuezhou Road, and requested that they be arrested immediately. Detective Li then went to the teahouse with detective Qi Mengqing and arrested four men from Jiangbei: Wu Kaiqun, Wu Kailin, Wu Shiquan, and Wang Xiaosanzi. After questioning, it was revealed that they were not the robbers in the case, but that Chen A'si had falsely accused them in order to claim a reward. Chen claimed that Wang Xiaosanzi had reported to him. When Wang was questioned, he denied it. The detectives accompanied the victim to the police station, but he stated that none of them were the robbers. The police chief detained Chen and Wang and released the three Wus. The next morning, they were sent to the First Court of the First District. The police representative, lawyer Zhang Tianyin, stated that the defendant Chen A'si had falsely accused residents of theft, hoping to get a reward. He claimed that Wang Xiaosanzi had reported to him at 8 a.m. that morning, but the robbery on Donghan Bile Road had not yet occurred at that time. Therefore, he requested that the court release Wang. Wu Kaiqun and the other two testified that Wang Xiaosanzi had invited them to the teahouse to help resolve a money dispute, and soon after, Chen A'si arrived with the police officers and arrested them along with Wang. They knew nothing about the robbery. When questioned, Chen A'si's testimony was evasive. Wang Xiaosanzi testified that he had known the three witnesses for many years. At that time, Chen A'si asked him to invite them to the teahouse to help him collect 20 yuan from someone. Shortly after, police officers arrived and arrested them, and he did not report to them that the robbers were the three Wus. Judge judged that Chen A'si was sentenced to four months imprisonment, and Wang Xiaosanzi was acquitted.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Zhengua Factory's Purchase of Peppermint Oil Raw Materials Leads to Litigation <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Jiliang, the general manager of Shanghai Zhenhua Peppermint Manufacturing Factory, sent Li Qianwan, the factory manager, to Ji'an, Jiangxi, in the autumn of last year to purchase raw materials for making peppermint oil. Li signed a consignment contract with Liu Youdao, the representative of the local Gongping Company, and Wang Rongbao of the Shengji Company. The contract stipulated a price limit, with Gongping consigning 6,000 catties and Shengji consigning 3,000 catties. In addition to the silver taels of deposit paid to Gongping at the time, he also gave a promissory note for 24,000 taels of silver. The remaining payment would be settled after the goods were transported to Shanghai. Later, the two companies sent Liu and Wang to Shanghai to escort the goods, but Zhenhua did not pick them up for a long time, and the promissory notes were not cashed when they matured. As a result, Gongping was owed 86,300 yuan, and Shengji was owed 36,000 yuan. Repeated demands were ignored. As the lunar new year was approaching, the two companies' representatives hired lawyers Ji Feng and Zhan Yigang to file a lawsuit against Zhu Jiliang, the general manager of Zhenhua, and Li Qianwan, the manager, requesting a court order to deliver the goods and pay the arrears, as well as interest for the delay. During the previous hearing at the First Special District Local Court, Zhu was also suing Li Qianwan in the Shanghai Local Court for secretly stealing the seal. Li was detained and unable to attend court, so the hearing was temporarily postponed. The day before yesterday, Judge Li Mo continued the trial, and Li Qianwan also appeared in court to confront the charges. The two plaintiffs first stated the circumstances of the contract with Li and presented the invoices. When questioned, the defendant Zhu Jiliang said that the Zhenhua factory's capital was only 20,000 taels of silver, so how could it handle goods worth 100,000 taels? Therefore, when he sent Li to Ji'an, he instructed him to purchase spot goods with cash, and did not order him to sign a contract with the plaintiffs. Li Qianwan then stated that although the factory's capital was only 20,000 taels, Zhu had publicly undertaken the responsibility of advancing funds for future purchases when the factory was established. The contract signed with the plaintiffs was drafted by Zhu's accountant in Zhu's office, so how could he deny it? The amount claimed by the two plaintiffs was accurate. The plaintiff's lawyer Zhan Jifeng presented letters and telegrams to prove that Zhu Jiliang had commissioned Li to purchase goods in Jiangxi. The defendant Zhu Jiliang's lawyer, Lu Dingkui, also presented a telegram draft book as evidence to the contrary. Judge Li then ordered the defendant to present the original telegram for verification, but Zhu claimed that the original telegram and other important items such as the factory's seal had been stolen by Li. Upon hearing this, Li firmly denied it. As a result, Judge Li returned all the evidence presented by both parties and instructed the lawyers to number each piece of evidence, provide an explanation, and submit a separate statement for a hearing and debate to be scheduled for a later date for review and judgment.</p>

<p>▲ Uncle Files Criminal Complaint</p>
<p>The late Yangzhou native Shen Shaoquan had previously held important positions in the Ministry of Finance and the Hubei Salt Transportation Bureau. In the spring of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Shen Shaoquan suffered the pain of losing his wife and lived alone and listlessly. At that time, a woman named Fu Shaoqing was teaching at Shaoquan's younger brother Zhichuan's home. Zhichuan was a young man who had served in the military and in salt affairs. The brothers had always lived together and were very harmonious. Soon after, Shaoquan and Fu developed a romantic relationship and began to live together. At that time, Shaoquan's mother was still alive and strongly disapproved of this. Shaoquan also feared public opinion and brought Fu to Shanghai to live. In the winter of that year, Shaoquan died of illness in Shanghai. Zhichuan was living in Yangzhou at the time and rushed to Shanghai upon hearing the news. He found that the coffin was already in the hall. He inspected the deeds of the joint property that Shaoquan had managed during his lifetime, but unexpectedly, they were all hidden by Fu. Zhichuan demanded them from her, but Fu claimed that she would inspect them after the funeral. After the funeral, she still procrastinated. At that time, Zhichuan's mother was critically ill in Yangzhou and sent a telegram summoning him. Zhichuan hastily returned to Yangzhou. Not long after, he was in mourning. Fu took this opportunity to use a large amount of the bank deposits and transferred the remaining balance to her own account, amounting to more than 300,000. Zhichuan came to Shanghai, but his attempts to negotiate were ineffective. He hired lawyers Li Chi, Zhang Bingjun, and Ouyang Yuan to file a criminal complaint for embezzlement. Yesterday, Judge Ma of the Second Special District Local Court of Shanghai opened a hearing and ordered the defendant Fu Shaoqing to post a bond of 30,000 yuan and scheduled another hearing for a later date.</p>

<p>▲ The home of Zhang Yongxiang, a farmer at 3 Zhangjia Tower, south of Pujiabridge, Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai, caught fire at around 11:00 p.m. the night before last due to an overturned kerosene lamp. The flames quickly pierced the roof. At one point, the wind fueled the fire, making it uncontrollable. Neighbors rushed to the scene and helped to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out at around 2:00 a.m. yesterday. A total of 11 tiled houses were burned and 5 were destroyed.

They were currently in the process of auditing accounts when the fire suddenly broke out, and he could not explain the cause of the fire.

<h3 id="e173">Abolish Party Rule <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jiguo</p>
<p>Past warlord governments, of course, did not allow us common people to participate in politics, but nominally there were always formal elected members to decorate the facade of a democratic country. Unfortunately, since the revolutionary Kuomintang shouted the slogan of "ruling the country by the party," not only has the form been abolished, but the people have been more obviously excluded from politics. It seems that reading about doctrines every day has made them forget the meaning of civil rights. We are not against seeking China's progress under the leadership of the party, but we are against using the slogan of "ruling by the party" to deprive the people of their due rights. Look at the current situation, from the highest authorities to the lowest cadres, so-called chairmen and so-called committee members, apart from internal party factions, where can you find half of them that are elected by the people? Not only that, but they even shout "use party members first for employment" and "lay off non-party members when downsizing," turning the entire Republic of China into a party-ruled "Chinese Party State." Of course, there are indeed many outstanding talents within the party, but are there none outside the party? No, there are, but they are buried alive under the name of party rule. We have a painful aversion to this. Under the rule of the brutal Japanese, we were slaves and of course had no right to participate in politics, but under party rule, although we are nominally great citizens, we still have no right to participate in government. What is the difference between the two? Therefore, in order to obtain our political power, we must resist imperialist aggression externally and demand the abolition of party rule internally. In fact, as I see it, there is no such thing as party rule. Wasn't Zhang Xueliang a very powerful warlord during the Northern Expedition? What doctrines did he understand? However, he was able to transform into a deputy commander and a supervisory committee member. Wasn't Gu Weijun wanted by the National Government? However, he was able to become a revolutionary foreign minister. So-called party rule is nothing more than a tool to deprive the people of their political power and create a special privileged class. Recently, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke and others declared that they would overthrow the dictatorship and establish a democratic government. However, examining their motives and evidence of the facts, it is nothing more than enabling a group of disgruntled party members to obtain political positions. The real masses are still excluded from politics, and talking about democracy without abolishing party rule is also a contradictory term. The current Chinese politics, although it looks like it is riddled with holes, the only key to getting to the root and source of the problem is to abolish party rule, gather talents from across the country, and organize a wise government representing the people, so that the people can express their views in politics and find a common way out. Only then can we talk about internal stability and external resistance. Finally, we solemnly declare that abolishing party rule does not fundamentally abolish the Kuomintang, but rather transforms Chinese politics from the hands of a few people to a universal development.

<p>Twenty motorcycles led the way, followed by the X government's military band, the Municipal Council's military band, and finally countless (reportedly four hundred) cars, loaded with wreaths and Guo's family flags, moving down the main street slower than handcarts, while crowds of people stood by the roadside to watch… watch Guo Biao's funeral!</p>
<p>"Guo Biao has surpassed Huang Chu Jiu." "Not even close to Sheng Xuanhuai! Sheng Xuanhuai's funeral caused a sensation with millions of people, unprecedented in Shanghai." People on the street chatted idly.</p>
<p>I couldn't cross the street. I had something important to do, but Guo Biao blocked me. That dead Guo Biao actually had such power to block my way!</p>
<p>Unable to pass, I stood there thinking: Why wasn't the X government's military band inspiring the people to resist the enemy, but instead sending off a company boss here? If the four hundred cars and their oil were under Ma Zhanshan's command, what a huge impact would it have? Old-style funerals, though not great, gave the poor some opportunities to earn a living. Modern funerals waste oil, drain national strength, and even beggars get nothing. Whose fault is this? Guo Biao is dead, surely Guo Biao didn't leave a will insisting on doing this? Some say funerals are purely for show, to flaunt a family's wealth and power. I want to ask: If there were no audience, would there be actors? Isn't this all our fault?</p>
<h3 id="e176">Anecdotes of Mr. Qiangcun <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Kuang Youhan</p>
<p>Qiang Zhang Shu Chao, is now housed at the Huzhou Guildhall in northern Shanghai. (Ouchao is the name Mr. Qiang himself inscribed on his coffin, and the late teacher Wu Changshuo engraved the end.) Awaiting burial next year in Daocheng Mountain in Huzhou, facing his ancestors' graves. At the time of the late father's death, Mr. Qiang had a mourning couplet: "If views are the same, talented men will find peace. Sects eventually return to Baishi in old age, relying on my land. Daocheng Mountain remains unharmed. Life and death alone for the green hills."</p>
<p>Mr. Qiang had very close relationships with the secular Mr. Lu Daoren and his maternal uncle, Mr. Qian Taixi. Mr. Lu's poem of mourning reads: "A thousand years of heroic spirit returns. Mountains and rivers still look as they did in the past. Literature serves the country, preserving the brush. Official attire accompanies the coffin. Heaven does not begrudge the elegies left behind. People only remember the completeness of past fame. Last night, I wondered why the lamp window was dim, wanting to write a letter on fish paper, especially cold. Twenty years of patience dare not seek trust. Superfluous remarks have been repeatedly praised. Intending to write a clear history. (The public once favored me with a handwritten biography of the late Qin Guoxiang Yi.) Contemplating only proves the cause of Lacquer Garden. In life, integrity surpasses peers. The most elegant of contemporary words. If you meet the old man Wu Changshuo on the road to the underworld, you can say that you can endure hardships by wearing coarse clothes." The maternal uncle's couplet of mourning reads: "Ascend Daocheng Mountain, with Kuang Huifeng arm in arm entering the forest. Golden bones are majestic, becoming the beauty of the mountains and rivers. Leave behind traces, chasing Li Changgu, returning to simplicity. The White Jade Tower now has experienced elders."</p>
<p>While Mr. Qiang was ill, he orally presented a poem in the style of "Partridge Sky" to colleagues in the poetry society in the winter solstice month: "I have not done my best in loyalty and filial piety. In recent years, the ginger quilt has become less warm. Are rhinoceros horns in my eyes real or not? After death, the cowhide coat is also grateful for the favor. Ephemeral things, like water and clouds, I have put my heart and soul into being a poet. Most sad is the human world, not concluding the unfinished cause of the next life." He died five days later, alas. I respectfully filled in the original tune to mourn him. "The sight of Qionggui reminds me of what you lived for. Spring frost and autumn dew are always affectionate. Eternal remembrance is painful and hard to sleep. Embracing the green felt several times to understand. Relying on the Big Dipper, comforting the orphans. How can the stars and mountains lean to the west again. Reciting a collection of posthumous songs a thousand times, the remaining cold crickets respond to my cry."</p>

<p>— Nanxi</p>
<p>"Painting tigers as if hearing roaring sounds. Tears of sorrow for the times flowing horizontally. The old master's brush still lifts the cauldron. Not to mention the disciples of your family." This is a poem I gave to Zhang Shanzi from Sichuan at the He Xiangning Relief Exhibition for National Crisis. There were many works by the Zhang brothers and their disciples. The Grand Wind Hall, where Shanzi and Daqian lived, was already famous for calligraphy, painting, and seal engraving. The disciples all followed the style of Huangshan, so many outstanding talents emerged. Such as nephews Zhang Xuming, Mu Quanzong, Zhou Weixin, Hu Ruosi, Wu Zijing, Lu Yuanding, and Yan Jiquan, all were fashionable talents of the time. Xuming was not yet twenty years old. After traveling to Huangshan with Shanzi and Daqian, his sketches were numerous and exquisite, with a high and elegant realm. Daqian also sighed and added touches to them. I often think about it. Learning to paint means learning from the ancients, emphasizing copying and touching. The Grand Wind Hall has a rich collection, looking at it on all sides, resting and living there. The first thing you can't get is that. Learning from nature means emphasizing roaming. Shanzi and Daqian have traveled to Huangshan many times. Their disciples must carry staffs and food, enjoying the pleasure of children and crown clouds, exhausting the wonders of mountains, rivers, clouds, and seas. The second thing you can't get is that. Chinese calligraphy and painting share the same principles. If you can't write, you are a craftsman. Daqian came from the school of Li Meian and Zeng Nongran, and passed on the brushwork to his disciples. Many of his disciples can write Northern Stele and ancient gold inscriptions, making the calligraphy of Zeng and Li flourish in the art world. The third thing you can't get is that. Everything in the world must have a cause and effect, a source. Wagons full of millet cannot be prayed for by one pig's shoulder. The ancients emphasized inheritance, and there is a reason for it. The world is so chaotic, and many people have advocated saving the country with calligraphy and painting. Even if we retreat and talk about it, maintaining the national culture is maintaining the national character. If the national character is not extinguished, the country will not be forgotten. Calligraphers and painters, even if they cannot wield weapons to defend the country, are still better than those who wear their hair loose, wear their clothes on the left, and speak the language of the Xianbei. I write this, regretting my garrulousness.</p>
<h3 id="e178">A Silver Dollar Saved My Life <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>Karma is a superstition, but there is also an incredible and mysterious principle in the dark. I have personally experienced something, and now I record it as material for your research.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, I served as a regimental commander in the Feng Army. One of my soldiers, named Zhong Desheng, was a bully who relied on his power. Once, he asked a poor old woman to make him a pair of shoes, agreeing on two thousand cash. After they were made, Zhong Desheng paid one yuan, and the old woman found the change for him. At that time, the money and goods were exchanged. After a while, the old woman suddenly came crying, saying that she was having a hard time. It turned out that the silver dollar was made of copper and could not be used. The old woman came to Zhong Desheng to ask him to exchange it, but Zhong deliberately cheated and insisted on not admitting it. The old woman originally wanted to make a profit from this, but she lost the shoes and also had to find change. She cried even more, but she didn't dare to argue with Zhong. I happened to pass by the door and asked about the reason. I understood in my heart and had to give the old woman one yuan, took the copper silver dollar, and put it in my pocket. This matter was considered over.</p>
<p>Not long after, the Jin-Feng War suddenly broke out. We were all ordered to go to the front. One day, I was commanding the troops to attack when a bullet flew straight towards my abdomen. At that time, I couldn't dodge, so I had to wait for death. But I was not harmed. I wondered why and looked closely. It turned out that the bullet had cleverly hit the copper silver dollar, turning it into a pot shape, so I was not injured. I remembered Zhong Desheng and checked the troops in the evening, only to find out that Zhong Desheng had died in battle long ago.</p>
<p>This story is what I personally experienced. I still keep that copper silver dollar to this day. Isn't this a clear manifestation of karma?</p>

<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>Recently, someone is building a twenty-four-story tall building at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Park Road in Shanghai. It is said that after this building is completed, it will be the first in the world, except for the United States. At least in the Far East, it will definitely be the best. However, at the same time, there is news that a public house built by a foreign company on the banks of Suzhou Creek is eager to show off and has started building a high-rise building of more than twenty-four stories, vying for the top spot in the Far East. Human ambition and competitiveness are used in this kind of place. Crafts are thus developed, science is thus advanced, and world civilization is thus glorified and limitless.</p>
<p>In the United States, there is a similar situation, and the competition is even more fierce. Today I build a thirty-story building, and tomorrow you build a forty-story building. Novelty is seen every day, and patterns are endless. According to the current record, the newly opened hotel on Park Street in New York can be regarded as the tallest, most beautiful, and best building in the whole world in the United States. The hotel has 2,200 guest rooms. The equipment in each room, in addition to the usual ones, has a radio and a video receiver. The whole building soars into the clouds, reaching forty-seven stories. There is a light railway around the building, specially prepared for people in the hotel to patrol.</p>
<p>However, this hotel, as it stands, has already had its</p>
<p>moment. In the near future, it will have to step down and retire. Because the plan for the "Fashionable Building" has been completed in the same city and will soon begin construction. After this fashionable building is completed, not only will it increase the number of floors to sixty, knocking down that big hotel with one punch, but also add different colors to the exterior of the building with originality. The lowest floors will be yellow and gold, followed by blue, followed by green, followed by red gold, followed by purple. Soaring high-rise buildings have dozens of colors, magnificent and splendid. I wonder who can knock it down.</p>

<p>— Chen Tianying</p>
<p>Mr. Li, named Xiang, styled Shenyan, came from a family in Xinghua, Jiangsu. From the Grand Scholar of the Zhongji Hall of the Ming Dynasty, with the posthumous title of Wending, seven generations to Mr. Li's father, named Mou. He suffered family misfortune in his youth and moved to the western suburbs of Yancheng, where he lived. He married Zhao and had two sons. Mr. Li was the second son. Mr. Li was born with intelligence and exceeded ordinary people. From the age of speech, he knew how to hold books, sitting and reciting, without stumbling. Many elders came to his door and asked to see him, praising him and calling him a broken treasure. His family was not wealthy, and his father used Confucianism to do business, disliking cunning and profiteering. He did many things, but none were successful. His family became poorer and poorer, to the point where he could not afford tuition. Mr. Li began to study the Spring and Autumn Annals with Mr. Shi of Jiangdu at the age of seventeen. He memorized and reviewed it from morning to night, accumulating knowledge and understanding. He often suffered from poor health, and sometimes his eyes frequently lost blood. He almost used up the oil for the lamp. There was a kind aunt, Xu Taimu, who lived in a famous residence in Yancheng, still a scholarly family. She had a rich collection of books. She pitied Mr. Li's poverty and illness and invited him to live in her house, providing him with medicine and food, and treating him well, so that he could complete his studies and achieve success. Mr. Li became more and more determined to improve himself, and his illness gradually subsided. He was able to read all of Xu's books, and his studies were completed. In his life, he was sharp-eyed and quick-thinking when reading, breaking through all obstacles. When he gained something, he immediately made a judgment, with a calm brow and a wise tail, and his words were naturally witty. In the past, he had managed and understood the classics and historical records, but he was especially proficient in the Selections of Refined Literature by Prince Zhaoming. He met the subtleties and side by side, grasping the essentials. He had accumulated a lot in his stomach, and his writing was naturally different. He rarely compared to the vastness of Cao Xue in the same era. He liked to praise the study of four pairs in his articles. The four Lius refer to the Han Zhi, Shi Shuo Xin Yu, Wen Xin Diao Long, and Shi Tong. Among the authors of the previous dynasty, only Zhi Fu and Wang's Shu Xue said that China does not hurt the embroidery, and the quality does not suffer from reality. How many people in ancient and modern times are elegant and lofty? He hid himself to compare himself to this. Mr. Li suffered the loss of his father at the age of twenty-two, and his career was so gloomy and worried that he became ill and collapsed. Mr. Li gave up his studies to take care of him, personally participating in menial tasks, with utmost sincerity and devotion, without wasting day and night. He left instructions to Mr. Li, do not give up reading, you must return to the old residence, revive the declining clan, and preserve our Li family, then you have taught your son. From then on, Mr. Li took his father's instructions to heart and increasingly questioned and learned diligently. Although he was trapped in a difficult situation, he still strove to be strong. He often blamed himself, did you forget the concern of the ancestors when they were dying? He felt sad as if he was carrying a wound for the rest of his life, which was his ultimate nature. After leaving Jiangnan, he traveled among famous officials and nobles, and his reputation became great. Outstanding people in the country competed to welcome him. Shen Yi of Jiaxing always praised Mr. Li as his guest whenever he saw him. This is Mr. Li, the master of the Jianghuai selection study. Wang Xiangqi of Xiangtan, with his talent and arrogance, despised Cao and others, but he treated Mr. Li's books and questions with unusual respect, not treating him the same as the common people.</p>

<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>In the second episode, they laughed and talked with a good teacher, and heard the bad news. The home was robbed, and they pitied each other. The room in the inn became a spring.</p>
<p>Our hometown is the worst place. It is located in the most remote and chaotic mountains. In recent years, I don't know how many bandits have gathered around. These leaders who pull the poles are exploited by Japanese ronin. Secretly provide them with money and firearms. Instigate them to disturb the local area. In order to give Japan an opportunity to advance and invade. They don't understand this. Sure enough, they gathered parties. At every turn, one or two thousand people or three to five hundred people is one pole. They ravaged our place and left no clean land. Either they robbed openly with fire. Or they kidnapped and extorted ransom. The people could not live in peace for half a day. I live in the county seat. There are still some troops and police guarding the city. More safe. His Anjiazhai is in the countryside. Bandits often went to harass them in groups. Later, all the villages and towns in the countryside saw that the government officials were out of reach. Unable to protect them. They jointly agreed on a method of self-defense. Each village and town organizes its own militia. Defend against bandits. Yutian's father, An, was a well-known gentleman in the local area. He is also the village chief of Anjiazhai. Then he was publicly elected as the chief of the militia. Speaking of this, I coughed occasionally. Liang Xiaoyun wanted to cut off his words because he was tired of listening. You're talking nonsense again. I'm in a hurry to ask what happened. Who is in the mood to listen to these things about bandits and militias. Wei Zhuomou also became anxious. Trees rise from the roots. Water flows to distant places. To talk about one thing. You have to explain the reasons in detail from the beginning. I didn't expect you to be so impatient. Then. I'll just say it simply and directly. Half a month ago. His father did not know for what reason. He offended a bandit leader named Niu Blackwind. Led a group of people into his Anjiazhai. Kill everyone you meet. Burn every house you see. His parents, both old, died under the random guns of the bandits. The entire village was washed clean. The houses were burned down. He also has a younger brother. His life and death are still unknown. Later, the government troops heard the news and went to help. The bandits tied up a lot of wealth. Kidnapped a few meat tickets. Before the government troops arrived, they roared away. Anjiazhai was only left with a pile of rubble and ashes, and even the funeral of the dead could not be arranged. You think Yutian received this bad news of family destruction. How painful must be in his heart. Do you have the leisure to come to you? This string of words. Like a string of arrows shooting non-stop. One branch after another directly pierced Liang Xiaoyun's fragile heart. Suddenly the ground collapsed. The flower-like face faded. The delicate red powder cheeks. Suddenly it turned pale like a layer of white paper. And it seems that the whole body limbs. They all fell into a freezing cold cellar. I couldn't help but feel a burst of chills. I couldn't help but tremble an jade hand. Holding Wei Zhuomou's arm tightly, he asked in a trembling voice. This… this is so scary. Didn't it ruin him alive? Now... what is he planning to do now?</p>

<p>A Western philosopher said, "China is a country that manufactures slogans." I think this statement contains at least 95% of the truth.</p>
<p>Look at the Northeast, from the provinces that were lost, until now, it has been more than three months. During these one hundred and more days, we, who are hanging the gilded signboard of resisting Japan and saving the country, have resisted what? Saved what? However, undoubtedly, we have only compiled a book of scriptures for saving the country.</p>
<p>There are many ways to save the country, each with its own ingenuity. Resisting Japan and saving the country is a wedge. Eighty-eight, sixty-four changes, there is the so-called "slogan to save the country," "black gauze to save the country." Therefore, the Eastern-made pins and paper in the cigarette paper store are sold out. The students think it is good to strike, so they all implement it, "strike to save the country." The professors think it is not good, and immediately shout to save the country without forgetting to study, and study without forgetting to save the country. "Studying to save the country" Modern men and women step up their work, compromise "You must pity me, and I pity you" "Love to save the country" Flower F of social interaction invented "Love letter to save the country." One call, hundreds of promises. The enthusiastic group implemented the "Armed to save the country" plan, so everywhere inside Shanhaiguan is a mixed army of bare hands.</p>
<p>The fascination of coffee shop beauty, the movement of flesh in the ballroom, the former is "Eating to save the country," the latter is "Dancing to save the country." The cinema emits a strong and dazzling Neon light. Batches of voyeurs stagger and disappear into its bloody mouth. It is said that this is "Entertainment to save the country" The bookstore owner rushed to print a large number of "beautiful cards" and published its "New Year to save the country" advertisement in the newspaper. In addition, adults have "Peace to save the country" and "Unification to save the country," artists have "Art to save the country," athletes have "Sports to save the country," economics doctors have "Cloth clothes to save the country" . . . . . .</p>
<p>"Save the country, save the country"! It has accomplished countless careers and created countless celebrities. It is precisely</p>
<p>The sound of saving the country fills the world,</p>
<p>The image of national destruction is all over the country!</p>

<p>— Ding Nu</p>
<p>All day long he wanders on the road, carrying a load of oranges and sugarcane, peddling everywhere. Although he can only earn four or five corners a day, his family depends on this income to survive. He has been living this life for several years.</p>
<p>One day, he ran home in the evening with joy and said to his wife, "I had good luck today. I went to peddle in front of a school and almost sold out all the goods. I will definitely go to Pudong to buy some new goods tomorrow. Look!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he took out all the money in his bag. The glittering of the white silver coins attracted his wife's attention. His wife smiled with satisfaction.</p>
<p>From this time on, he stood in front of the school every day to peddle.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>About a year later, a bungalow was built in front of the school. A lot of fresh fruits were placed in front of the store, and various canned foods and cigarettes were placed on the shelves. Inside was a coffee shop. A group of students walked here after class to eat fruits and drink coffee. From morning to night, there was almost no empty seat inside. It was often possible to see people surrounding the front of the store. The business can be said to be very good.</p>
<p>At this time, everyone knew that the peddler who had been carrying a load on the road a year ago was now the owner of this bungalow.</p>
<p>The boss stood at the door of the store with a radiant face, nodding and smiling at the customers!</p>
<p>Not long after, a middle-aged woman was added here, with a plump figure and shiny black eyes, and a delicate and beautiful face, which made the boss reveal a lot of spring. It is said that this woman is the boss's newly married concubine. The boss is very lucky!</p>
<p>At that time, the boss's heart was blooming, and he often went out with his concubine. From this time on, he was rarely seen standing at the door of the store.</p>

<p>It was one afternoon three years later. The north wind was blowing, and the weather was very cold. There was almost no one walking on the road. At this time, a dung truck was pushed out from the school gate. It was full of residual vegetable juice, probably to feed the pigs. The person pushing the cart was sweating and pushing it from side to side, obviously he didn't have that much strength.</p>
<p>After he walked past, someone stood at the school gate and said:</p>
<p>"He is the owner of the fruit shop in that bungalow two years ago. Now he is in trouble."</p>

<p>Calcutta dispatch from the World Society: An Indian named Swami possesses extraordinary skills, capable of swallowing various universally known deadly poisons without any harm.</p>
<p>Recently, at the University of Calcutta, under extremely rigorous scientific supervision, he publicly demonstrated his abilities. He swallowed extremely poisonous potassium cyanide, as well as glass shards and nails, without any adverse reactions. After swallowing the poisons, doctors examined his stomach with X-rays, confirming they were indeed inside.</p>
<p>Sir Lyman, the eminent British scientist in charge of the experiment, stated that this poses a concrete challenge to all of modern science, saying, "I am completely bewildered by him."</p>
<h3 id="e186">Fountain Spring <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou's "Air-Compressed Tin Can" from the other day was a physics novelty; now, the "Fountain" is a chemistry novelty. However, both experiments rely on air pressure to produce these phenomena, so they can be considered two methods of demonstrating air pressure.</p>
<p>The structure of the "Fountain" is very simple: all you need is a glass bottle, a cup, a long glass tube, a rubber ball, a suction tube, a dry battery, two copper wires, and a cup of salt water. First, pierce two holes in the bottle's stopper, ready to insert the suction tube and the long tube. Then, fill the empty cup with red or another colored water, and also put some water in the suction tube. Next, connect the two copper wires to the two poles of the battery, and insert the other ends of the copper wires into the salt water (allowing current to pass through the salt water). Before long, the salt water will turn yellowish-green, then pour some of the green water into the bottle. Then, cover the bottle with the stopper. Afterwards, heat the bottle over a fire, and you will see water vapor gradually evaporating. When the green water is almost dry, immediately install the long tube and the suction tube, and turn the bottle upside down so that the other end of the long tube is immersed in the cup of red water.</p>
<p>At this point, the "Fountain" is complete. As long as you squeeze the rubber ball (attached to the suction tube), the red water in the cup will immediately rise up the tube, and at the top, it will spray out very quickly—it's really beautiful, just like a "Fountain"—until the red water in the cup is completely sprayed out, then it will stop.</p>
<p>The principle behind this novelty is very common. The green water is water containing hydrochloric acid (because it still contains Nash). When it is heated in the bottle, it turns into gas, driving out the air in the bottle, so that the bottle contains only a large amount of hydrochloric acid gas. Afterwards, when the rubber ball is squeezed, water is injected into the bottle through the suction tube. Because "hydrochloric acid gas is very soluble in water," the gas in the bottle immediately dissolves in the water, causing the inside of the bottle to become a vacuum, that is, the air pressure is reduced. Therefore, the red water in the cup, under the pressure of the surrounding air (the pressure per square inch is equal to fifteen pounds of force), rises into the bottle with lower pressure. In this way, a "Fountain" novelty is formed.</p>

<p>In order to deliver some books to the Shanghai Law School, I had to take a trip to Shanghai.</p>
<p>By the time I returned to Baoshan Road, it was already 6:05 PM. The No. 3 tram was packed with people!</p>
<p>To the right of a classmate sitting next to me, a villager who looked like a worker suddenly sat down. Because the crowd was so dense, his arms were folded on the shoulders of those on either side. Furthermore, because of the shaking of the tram, his arms were rubbing irregularly on the shoulders of those on either side. This aroused the anger of the classmate to my right!</p>
<p>He uttered a hateful sound, glaring at the villager, and viciously pressed his left arm under his own right arm. Only then did he look at the tabloid in his hand, as if his anger had subsided a little. The villager, of course, did not make a sound or resist in any way. But I saw it all and remembered it in my heart!</p>
<p>I thought: If someone also a proud college student was sitting next to him, how would he dare? And if a fashionable young lady were sitting next to him, how could he bear to do so?</p>

<p>Such is Shanghai (Part One)</p>
<p>After the plan to set up a small-scale library was decided, the next day, I, Wei Xin, and Ze Pu went to select a library site—actually, just to rent two bungalows.</p>
<p>We walked along Henan Road. Before long, we spotted a "For Rent" sign. So, we stopped moving forward.</p>
<p>*Ding ding ding…* Wei Xin stepped forward and rang the doorbell. In less than a minute, a nanny, as fat as a pig, came out to open the door.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" the nanny asked, half-opening and half-closing the door.</p>
<p>"To see the house!" Wei Xin replied.</p>
<p>The house for rent was on the third floor. We went up and looked around, front and back, left and right. The rooms were not too big and not too small, with a bedroom and an office, and there was no lack of sunlight or air…it was just right for us. We went down to the living room, but there wasn't a single person in sight. So, Wei Xin shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Hello!"…</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman, wearing short clothes, covered in powder, and with disheveled hair, came out. Wei Xin asked her:</p>
<p>"How much does your house cost?"</p>
<p>"Thirty-two yuan!"</p>
<p>We couldn't help but shake our heads and click our tongues.</p>
<p>"Do you have family?" Before we could even bargain, the middle-aged woman asked us this question.</p>
<p>"No!" Wei Xin replied to her.</p>
<p>"No family, no renting!" The middle-aged woman walked away with her hands on her hips…</p>
<p>So, we had no choice but to go to the second house.</p>
<p>We went to one house after another, running around for half the day. It wasn't that there weren't any houses, or that we didn't have enough money; the only reason was that we "didn't have family," and they "only rent to families"!</p>
<p>I felt that this was outrageous! Does not having a "woman" (family) mean you can't rent a house? At twelve o'clock (we left at eight o'clock in the morning), I came back and said angrily: "No way! I have to go rent one this afternoon! I don't believe you can't rent a house without a woman!…"</p>
<p>Wei Xin, who was experienced in Shanghai, heard my words and explained to me:</p>
<p>"It's not their fault! Indeed, many single men rent houses, and then leave without paying them! Their meaning is: as long as you have a family member, the man can run away, but the 'woman' can't run away!…so they feel relieved…that's how Shanghai people are!…"</p>
<p>I felt that Wei Xin's words made sense. At the same time, I finally understood:</p>
<p>"So that's how Shanghai people are!…no,</p>
<p>That's how Shanghai society is!…" Haha! Interesting!…</p>

<p>The Success of X Bund</p>
<p>The Bund was originally a small path along the Huangpu River used by boatmen to pull ropes. When the Chinese government announced the first set of land management regulations for the concessions, it had already declared that this path used by the rope pullers should be preserved. It was stipulated that a thirty-foot space should be left between the buildings along the river and the riverbank, that is, the construction of buildings must be thirty feet away from the riverbank. Therefore, foreigners building houses had to drive piles into the section of the riverbank in front of the foundation and fill in that section of the road. This is the origin of the Bund, but at that time it was still a muddy and difficult road; now it has become an extremely beautiful place for strolling. One of the characteristics of Shanghai now is that there is a very wide open space between the buildings facing the river and the riverbank. The original intention of preserving this wide open space was not for aesthetic reasons, but to leave a large road for boatmen to pull ropes.</p>
