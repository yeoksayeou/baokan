<h3 id="c1">日本刧奪東北關税問題　彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>邇近所謂滿洲僞國秉承日人之旨意。始則將大連以外東北海關之税收。停匯總税務司。繼復由僞財長熙洽藉口確立關税自主聲明準備掌握大連及其他海關税收之全部。今且已實行纂提濱江安東之税欵。積極進行刧奪全部之東北關税。此一事實。任何人應皆知其主演者爲日人。所謂滿洲僞國。特不過一羣受人驅策之傀儡。故劫奪東北關税者。與其謂爲所謂滿洲僞國。毋寗直謂爲日人。</p>
<p>東北海關。計共有愛琿濱江琿春延吉安東大連等六處。每年税收逹關平銀二千餘萬兩。約當我國海關税收全額百分之十五。而且就貿易而言。我國亦惟東北一隅年爲出超。故東北關税而被刧奪。其影響於我國家之財政。實至鉅大。</p>
<p>二十日財長宋子文氏爲此一。問題。曾發表宣言。以我國關税爲國内外債信用之總脈。關税關係外債至鉅。及破壞我關税完整兩點。籲請列强對此「嚴酷摧毁四百兆人民償債能力之舉動。」予以嚴密之注意。而同時美國已一度向日本提出反對通牒。英國亦將同様抗議。此初非作仗義之言。尤非厚愛我國。特爲其本身利益而抗議耳。我國不能以自力維護主權。東北之淪亡。呼助至今。旣未收寸效。今乃復向列强呼籲。不以自力抗爭。事之可悲可痛。寗尙有逾於此者。</p>
<p>東北之淪亡。即爲日人所謂大陸政策之實現。滿洲僞國之樹立。特不過如掩蔽國際視聽之一種烟幕彈。我國如不能早日收回失地。則日人之實行日滿合一。蓋爲旦夕間。事觀夫一月間東京朝野舉行滿洲問題之一幕話劇中。關於自由港與關税問題之談話。朝日記者和田謂「旁的國家。有些時候對日本旣是封閉門户的。日滿也可以用這種關係來對外鎖闭。」及日僑奉天商會書記長。「照新國家所定的方式。徴收輸入税輸出税自然是要全廢的」之談話。可知日本刦奪東北關税之目的。一在於築起關税壁壘。對外封鎖</p>
<p>一在於全廢輸出税。攫取廉價之原料。實則整個之東北。旣已全被操持於日人之手。則其對關税之予取予求。要亦爲事所必然。初無足怪。獨是吾人處此情勢之下。應認定關税問題與東北問題一整個問題。必收回東北失地。而後關税問題乃能解决。抑且以年入二千餘萬之關平銀之關税。與東北半壁河山較。則山河爲重。而關税爲輕。吾人如長此坐視半壁山河之淪亡而不急　恢復。則復何有於此二千餘萬兩之關税。如不甘坐視如不甘山河破碎。種　凌夷。則恢復失地。實尤急於爭回關税。失地復。則關税亦復。他人之助力終不可必。惟自助乃能自救。此則我政府我國人。在今日所最應認清最應覺悟者也。</p>
<p>二十一日前日本駐美大使石井在歡迎新美使節時。已曾倡言「日本在亞陸施展其和平與天然之開拓。美國之干涉。乃不必有之事。亦猶日本之不必干涉西半球也。」紐約時報曾稱爲亞洲門羅主義之暴露日人而欲實現亞洲門羅主義。固自爲痴人之夢想。然而就石井之談話。日人之勃勃野心。已可想見一斑。來日艱難甚多。豈僅當前東北關税之掠奪而已。我人如再不能以自力謀自衛自救。則極目前途。尙堪設想耶。</p>

<p>主張世界軍備普减三分之一</p>
<p>各國一致贊助法日獨持異議</p>
<p>國民社二十二日日内瓦電　軍縮會議總委員會、今日下午舉行特别會議、漢德森主席、力言本會已陷入飄泊無依之境、亟圖挽救之必要、嗣美代表吉伯生即起立宣讀美總統胡佛給渠之訓令、提議世界軍備統减三分之一、胡佛於訓令之内聲稱、白里安凱洛格之非戰公約因各國</p>
<p>皆宣稱其軍備純爲自衛之故、致在國際間之價值爲之大减、因此美國不僅主張現有軍備之普遍减削、且建議今後在新</p>
<p>標準之内、亦宜多置自衛軍器、減少侵略軍器、至胡佛所提具體計劃、列有（一）廢除坦克車·轟炸機·活動大砲、禁止化學及細菌戰爭與天空轟擊、（二）軍隊實力普減三分之一（三）前經條約規定之一切主力艦噸位及隻數、再減三分之一、巡洋艦及輔助艦再減四分之一、潛艇噸位最多不得逾三萬五千噸、美總統並於訓令内力稱、此項方案對於挽救財政、定可大收效果、</p>
<p>英嫌美提議不透澈　路透二十二日日内瓦電、美代表宣布此提議後、頓令總委員會發生深刻印象、英外相西門首先發言、謂英政府對此提議、定予以極愼重之考慮、英國在某數點、尙欲海軍有更大之縮減、甚於胡佛總統所提議者、如潛艇者即其一端、英國對於潛艇、主張廢除云、西門又稱、主力艦噸位之縮減、未見提議、渠主張在一九三七年倫敦條約許各國重建主力艦時、各國宜有恊定、主力艦每艘噸位不得過二萬五千噸、而其主要砲位不得過十二寸、渠希望各種軍艦、可因此而遞減其噸位云、</p>
<p>意大利無條件接受　意代表格蘭第繼起發言、謂渠以墨索里尼名義宣佈意國完全接受美國提議云、意外相逐條説明胡佛總統所提各點、切實聲明意國不附條件接受之、此言發後、全塲鼓掌、歡聲雷動、爲國聯會塲中所罕有、</p>
<p>法國流露反對態度　法代表彭古爾發言、其反對美總統提議之意、雖極掩飾、但終流露於外、彭氏屢以安全問題爲言、謂比例的軍縮、將妨害小國之利益、如軍縮會議討論胡佛總統之提議、則應同時考慮法國所提出國際軍之議案云、彭氏末稱、美國提議可得法國之同情的考慮云、</p>
<p>李維諾夫語含譏諷　蘇俄代表李維諾夫發言、意含譏剌、謂今日會議、提醒與會者使知彼等今仍爲軍縮會議之會員、此事殊可歡迎云、</p>
<p>德國切望軍備平等　德代表那度尼表示對於胡佛總統倡議切實軍縮之滿意、希望其終能挽救會議之失敗、並聲明歡迎胡佛總統所稱可將業受凡爾賽和約限制人數軍備之德國軍隊、作爲計算其他國家陸軍實力之基礎、但以爲胡佛總統所稱軍縮不應擾亂各國間均勢之理論、對於業已减縮軍備之國家、宜略予假借准許若干點例外、總之减縮軍備愈切實愈嚴厲、則平等問題愈易解决、而樹立平等原則、則爲欲圖本會成功之最重要條件之一、</p>
<p>松平公然爲法張目　日代表松平發言、謂日本準備合作、以研究美國提議、此議須愼重考慮、俾可以適當形式、保障有關係國之防務云、</p>
<p>小國代表一致擁護　與會小國約二十國一致爲意德後援、無條件接受美國提議、但衆覺反對終難打銷、軍縮會議現已休會、未决定下次集會日期、</p>
<p>路透二十二日華盛頓電　胡佛總統從白宮發出正式文告、謂渠之軍縮提議、不獨可使各國免去軍備與其維持費之重大担負、且可免除刻在國會中造艦程序之一大部份、此議可使美國在三年内有約定的軍力、而不干涉現有之建造、亦不减少現役人數、軍縮不與戰債相提並論云、美總統並説明下述數點（一）凱洛格非戰公約僅可作世界國家已依允祗在國防方面用其武力之解、（二）軍縮之實行、不僅在一般軍備之普遍縮减、但亦在减少攻擊力、藉以增多防守力、（三）世界軍備之澎脹、起於彼此之相對、今以廣義言之、此種相對、在軍縮中仍須保全、（四）軍縮必須眞正而切實、必先有經濟解放之效力、（五）陸軍海軍空軍之難題、彼此互相維繫、吾人一面可增進和平之保障、一面可使世界在今後十年内節省一○·○○○·○○○·○○○元至一五·○○○·○○○·○○○元之浪費云、</p>
<p>路透二十二日華盛頓電　據可恃消息、胡佛總統並無如其他大國不接受美國提議、則美國將單獨行動之意、再美國此議之提出、與戰債减縮無關、美總統以爲如將此議與减免戰債事相聯提出、則或碍及歐洲諸國之尊嚴、官塲估計如美總統提議得見實施、則美國在此後十年中、可省二·○○○·○○○·○○○元、</p>

<p>路透二十三日華盛頓電　胡佛總統軍縮計畫關於削减海軍實力一節、其實際影響如下、（一）美國與大不列顚之巡洋艦處於均等地位、每國得置二十五萬噸、日本得置十五萬噸、（二）美國將拆毁戰艦（五艘）共十萬零五千噸、潛艇三萬五千噸、（驅逐艦十六萬五千噸、將添造巡洋艦三萬五千噸、飛機母艦九千噸、（三）大不列顚將拆毁主力艦十二萬三千噸、飛機母艦一萬四千噸、巡洋艦十二萬噸、驅逐艦八萬二千噸、潛艇二萬五千噸、（四）日本將拆毁主力艦八萬八千噸、巡洋艦七萬七千噸、飛機母艦八行噸、驅逐艦四萬噸、潛艇四萬五千噸、</p>

<p>路透二十三日東京電　陸相荒木今日對報界宣稱、胡佛總統之軍縮建議、日本無接受之可能、並謂斷不能以縮减軍備同等之比率施於各國、蓋須顧念每國之特殊情勢也、荒木又謂日本必須注意其非常地位、即其鄰有中俄兩國是也、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日東京電　海軍大員評論報載胡佛總統之軍縮建議、表示日本大約準備贊助廢除化學戰法天空轟擊城邑及減少飛機母艦、惟對應否廢除轟炸飛機殊爲懷疑、至於大減主力艦與巡洋艦則絶對反對、陸軍當局對於胡佛總統之建議可否實行殊抱疑慮、而視爲幾與蘇俄全廢軍備之議同一不能實行、並疑及胡佛總統之誠意、以爲其提出此議之主要志願、乃求在競選總統中得人歡心云、政界對胡佛總統軍縮建議之意見、似爲太覺過分、而難完全接受、惟殊可欽佩、而值得予以極充分之考慮、惟並聲明</p>
<p>當局尙未遑加以詳細研究、據現象觀之、日本須待其他列强表示意見、然後宣布日本之立塲、惟當局已隠示（一）日本之態度、大部分須視蘇俄之態度而定、（二）日本對縮減軍備之意見、自始即以滿洲日人利益之安全爲主、至於戰債賠欵而有影響於歐洲者、實與日本無關、（三）如大不列顚美國日本之海軍軍備處於均等地位、則日本準備承允互減三分之一、惟日本目下之海軍實力已遜於他國、恐不堪再減三分之一、至就主力艦而論、日本可允完全廢除而與各國相等、但不能允減三分之一、而使其此項實力遠遜於人、</p>
<h3 id="c77">美提案留有讓步餘地 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>路透社二十三日紐約電　今晨各報皆豫料胡佛總統之軍縮建議、前途荊棘孔多、惟並切言此項建議留有折中與讓步之餘地、紐約時報載有社論、目光尤注於法國、文内稱讚此項計畫、並追述日本昔嘗反對凱洛格非戰公約、美法國前曾力促、美國承允加入對受侵略攻擊之任何國施以武力保護之行動、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日華盛頓電　胡佛總統之建議、（今患非全出其個人意見）在日内瓦引起之反響、據昨日美代表吉白生由大西洋電話報告史汀生稱、實較其所料爲佳、民主黨參議員羅萍生表示意見、謂此項計畫、實軍縮會議實際的試金石、惟外交界則視爲一種幌子、蓋如經歐洲諸國拒絶、而萬一談話决裂、則美國即可脱卸其責任也、且以爲美國於是將對取銷戰債之一切請求、饗以閉門羹、蓋歐洲列强拒絶藉軍縮而施經濟補救法也、</p>

<p>路透二十三倫敦電　英報多認胡佛總統之軍縮提案、爲一勇敢且具激勵性之計劃、其中長處頗多、足爲應有行動之根據、泰晤士報稱、該提案「措詞鋭利、範圍廣闊」包括可在日内瓦最爲人贊同之各點、關於陸地軍備各節、英帝國對之、可無疑慮、但關於海軍之提議、一經官塲研究後、將使英國最注意之云、該報續稱、贊同胡佛提案最有力理由之一、即此提案如獲有效之補充、則將使凱洛格非戰公約之違犯、在事實上爲不可能云、其他保守黨報紙對此提案、均表示贊助、惟極端保守黨份子則謂逾分縮减目前唯一防止戰爭之工具、恐非眞正經濟辦法云、自由黨份子稱、該提案爲一莊嚴之領導、并勸法國盡其本分、工黨份子指此議爲切於實用之提案、表示欣幸、但不贊成英外相西門「模稜兩可」之態度、此間有一方面獨作悲觀論調、視美國軍縮主張、爲干涉舉動、并爲妨碍洛桑會議成功之原因、蓋以爲法國未必贊成美方計畫也、西門外相之反倫敦、可認爲英内閣重視美國提議之表徴、</p>
<p>國民社巴黎電　美總統痛削軍備之提議、巴黎各晚報羣相訾議、咸謂無論如何法國不能接受、巴黎晚報並稱、胡佛新計劃僅爲一種策略作用、即倡議此計劃者、恐亦未必自信其能成功、又謂此種計劃、外觀雖似極重要、若究其底藴、殊未必然、美國改選總統在即、無人敢担保下届總統或下届國會將遵行此計劃、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日巴黎電　日報謂法國大多數報紙由胡佛總統軍縮建議中所獲</p>
<p>之唯一滿意、厥爲大不列顚向對美國頗形柔順、今已表示「活動的獨立」、該報稱西門之演詞爲「花下之殯葬」、又謂胡佛總統利用日内瓦作其競選運動、實不足引爲大憾、蓋彭古亦得良機重行聲明法國之理論也、今無條件贊助胡佛總統者、皆屬希圖修正和約之國、意外相格蘭第演詞所得「眞正非禮」之采聲、實爲歐洲明確對美國之屈服云云、</p>

<p>路透社二十三日洛桑電　今晨麥唐納與赫禮歐作重大之談話、以求覓得共同立塲之可能、衆信會議有急轉直下之勢、談話之結果、衆皆殷切以待之、</p>
<p>路透社二十二日洛桑電　英外相西門已起程赴倫敦、將以洛桑賠欵會議與日内瓦軍縮會議雙方之最近發展、報告英内閣、大約星期六日可返洛桑、法總理赫禮歐今日晤英相麥唐納、麥授以備忘錄一件、説明英國對於賠欵之立塲、依英國見解、德國現不能償付賠欵、如將來須其照繳、則必予以充分時間、俾德國元氣得以恢復、此備忘錄所言者、簡直即以英國見解爲根據之原則、並聲明此種辦法、必</p>

<p>不可有妨害德國恢復之性質、且必爲最後辦法、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十三日洛桑電　據德國傳來消息、英國關於賠償之意見、已繕具備忘錄、有四項要素如下、（一）洛桑會議覓得之解决辦法、應具有確定之性質、（二）德國如交付賠欵、不應擾亂經濟關係、（三）德國如此付欵、亦不應妨害德國經濟及財政之恢復、（四）即使日後德國付欵能力恢復、亦不應再負賠欵之義務、此項義務、應否由德國再行負擔一層、必俟債權國本身財政感受困難時、始可加以考慮、且無論欵項大小、必俟德國貿易贏餘預算均衡時、始能强其交付、</p>
<p>國民社二十二日洛桑電　今日法總理赫禮歐與奥總理杜甫士、會晤一小時許、聞談話極融洽、赫禮歐最後曾保證法國將重行考慮其對於、救濟奥財政之政策、因此今日此間復大起法國可改變其否定態度之希望、</p>

<h3 id="c105">告主張對俄復交者　陳啟天 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>並質申報記者陳彬龢君　（三續）</p>
<p>這段論調、彷彿又由「復交論」一變而爲「共產論」、我要請問陳君明確答復的、你究竟是單主張復交呢、還是兼主張共產呢、如果你旣主張復交又主張共產、那我再同你辯論共產的問題、如果你只主張復交而反對共產、便不應如此閃鑠的措詞、而且徒逞一面之詞、以淆惑無知者的視聽、據説申報行銷十三萬份、至少有二十萬讀者、像這様大報的記者、似乎對於時評的立論措詞、要特别謹愼、而且説一句話便要負責任、陳君、你是一個新興的名記者、望你珍重前途、多多爲國民造福、免得將來失悔、這是我一片善意的忠告、希望陳君諒納、六年以前、該有多少人爲共黨捧塲、然而結果怎麽様呢、即以陳獨秀君而論、他不是宣傳共產最力、主持共黨最久的人物嗎、然而俄國以他不贊成暴動政策、便説他是「機會主義者」、「取消主義者」、將他除名、如今共匪不認他做共黨、只落得與少數失意的同志躱在租界上、偶然發出悲哀的呼聲、俄國將他利用完了、便要打倒、以免尾大不掉、我眞爲他呌屈、徒然做了俄國的犧牲品、我又爲他可惜、誤盡許多熱烈的靑年、吾友惲代英君、與我有十四年的交情（元年到十四年）深知其能説能幹、實在是共黨中的一個頭等脚色、去年他從湖北到上海來調解共黨的内部鬭爭、竟爲其同志告密陷害而死、他臨死前、曾告某君説、「我死了也好、像現在的所謂共產與我原來的理想不知相去幾萬里、黨内的黑暗和爭奪、實在令人看不上眼、又令我左右做人難、到不如早死了的好、」我聽到這個消息、深深爲他可惜、好一個人才、徒爲俄國所犧牲、</p>
<p>我説的話似乎離了題、現在再回過頭來與陳君討論、假定「中國現狀爲最適合於共產主義之泥土」究應否立即對俄復交、在未討論此問題之先、我們要認清中國共匪猖獗原因有兩大類、一大類是内因、從内部起來的、即陳君所謂「泥土」之類、又一大類是外因、從俄國打進的、即俄國利用復交後的種種方便策動共黨的進行之類、我們要挽救中國、肅清共匪、必須同時内外兼醫、標本兼治、如果只防外不醫内、那固是如同置腐物於鐵匣之中、終久要生蟲甚至朽壞、如果只醫内不防外、那又同泥土放於露天之下、任人散種毒草、並且灌溉·施肥·得以迅速發揚滋長、致於使人一觸便濫手、那就更無法救治了、因此我們可以將陳君的文章改爲如下、以表示我們的意思、</p>
<p>問題之重心、不僅在於我國是否有適合共產主義之泥土、星否有足使共產主義流行之機會、而且在俄國是否於復交後利用此泥土與機會、以宣傳共產、助長共匪、如其復交之後、俄國更可利用此泥土與機會以逹赤化中國之目的、則立即對俄復交適足速中國之亡耳、又何益之有、置問題之外因而全不問、是欲開門揖盜、認賊作子、徒爲匪張目而已、吁　物已先腐、雖置於鐵匣、猶恐生蟲、奈何毫不加以愛護、任毒菌得隨處侵入、以自速其死耶、</p>
<p>今「我國無堅强之統一政府」無「嚴密之社會組織」、無「穏定之人民生活」、無「控制共產主義者之把握」即欲步伍列强、大開門户、讓「赤色恐怖之陰謀者」自由出入、是不啻於中國泥土之上任人播以共產毒種、復加以扶持助長、益使赤禍無法收拾矣、我國欲圖挽救、在一面内除國賊、革新政治以其本、一面外抗强權、（抗日與絶俄均含在内）、肅清共匪（共匪乃俄之便衣隊）以治其標、若不如此標本兼治、内外同顧、而欲以立即對俄復交爲揚湯止沸之計、所見不亦太左耶、（註三）（註四）</p>
<p>註一、陳彬龢君的時評五篇見申報、（一）五月十二日「對蘇復交與防遏共產（二）同月十三日「從國際形勢談到中俄復交」、（三）同月十四日「三論中蘇復交」、（四）五月三十日「對蘇復交釋疑」、（五）六月四日「再釋對蘇復交」、</p>
<p>註二本篇所節引陳君原文、俱見於以上五篇中、爲省字計、未分别註明於各引文下、爲明論旨計、所引文句均依原交、未加增删、</p>
<p>註三、末段改用文言、本與本篇文體不合、而且指詞以依陳君的腔架、亦不盡如意、但爲求比照論點的異同與是非似較明白、故試爲之、</p>
<p>註四、本篇原定還有一節以與陳君詳細商量前五篇時評中所舉復交的理由是否充足、以做了一個整夜（由八號晚七時到九號早七時）、不能再繼續做下去、姑以本篇與陳君作初步的討論、文中所稱陳君均指彬龢先生、並不是自稱、（完）</p>

<p>我們三個人丨朱先生，小弟弟，我丨去到野外散步看見陳大嫂子在塘邊洗衣服，朱先生指着背後草地上説；「那是什麽意思？」我順着朱先生所指的地方看去只見一個活活潑潑的小孩子在一個大筐子裏坐着！原來這是陳大嫂子的小寳寳，家裏没有人帮忙照應，又怕他在塘邊玩水，所以他媽媽弄了一個筐子要他坐在那兒。陳大嫂子是洗了幾下便回過頭來望望。朱先生問：「像這一類的事，多不多呢？」我説：「有一天早上孫大媽左手拿了一條小板橙，右手牽着她的四歲女兒到廟裏來説：「鐘兒！我要挑柴進城賣，巧姑托你代我看管半天，只須呌她坐在橙子上不要給她東跑西跑就得了。」這一類的事是常有的，托鄰居親戚照應的比較多些。」朱先生和筐裏的小寳寳玩了一會兒，便一面走一面想，忽然興高彩烈的説：「鐘兒丨我們今天是探獲了一個新大陸！我看出那筐子裏的小寳寳是陳大嫂子的一個累。巧姑是同様的累了孫大媽。還有那些在家裏像尾巴様跟前跟後，使媽媽奶奶累得發急的還多着咧。」我説：「先生的話很對。這些孩子，不過三五歲，又不能守牛，又不能割草，又不能送飯，在家裏擋手擋脚，出門去尾大不掉，農家婦女的確是累得没有辦法。先生怎麽看了這件事就如此的歡天喜地。你所發現的新大陸是什麽？」</p>
<p>朱先生説：「這些孩子是没有你所説的那一大堆困難了。哭囉·抱囉僫囉，尿囉，屎囉屎尿是都不大成問題了如果我們有一個地方給這些小孩們玩，做媽媽的把他們寄托在這裏可以放心去做事。而且早上送來，晚上抱去，一天不見，如隔三秋，母子間之親愛幸福可想而知。在城裏收這様小孩的地方呌做托兒所，幼稚園，托兒所幼稚園下了鄉眞是得其所哉。鄉下是托兒怕幼稚園的新大陸！」</p>

<p>關於和平軍　英國某周刊説。最近有人鑒於遠東中日戰爭的劇烈。大非世界和平之福。所以提議組織一大隊和平軍。去插在兩軍陣綫之間。以阻止雙方的作戰。這原是一個很好的意見。並且歴史上曾有先例。當羅馬帝國旣信奉了基督敎之後。而武士們的流血的角鬥。仍是多數民衆所愛看的玩意。有一天正在角鬥之際。便有一個基督敎的僧侶名呌戴勒麥克司Ｔｅｌｅｍａｃｂｕｓ。跳到角鬥塲中去。投身在那兩武士之間。阻止他們的流血。可憐這僧徒徒負一片好意。終於被二人所殺。但是這悲慘的印象深印在民衆的心目之中。後來就將角鬥廢止了。然而這様的故事。不能適用於現代。所以和平軍之有無效力。還是一個疑問。最可靠的和平使者。還得期望於一般國際的銀行家。拒絶一切軍備的借欵就得了。</p>

<p>一二八之役。日駐滬海軍司令鹽澤。狃於瀋變。以爲華軍必不敢抵抗。縱抗亦不能持久。四小時即可解决。故貿然發難。豈意十九路軍抵抗之猛烈。竟使日海軍陸戰隊合在鄉軍人六千人潰不成軍。苟非租界爲護符。且將全軍覆没。日政府乃令野村率援軍來滬。當時日人仍自信非凡。一若野村一至。即可解决十九路軍者。他國出而調停。則曰野村中將係一和平的政治家。必不使事態擴大。野村對外報記者談話。亦有「再越七日。吾人</p>
<p>在滬工作。即可終止」之語。其驕傲如此。詎數度進攻。依然敗績。日政府始震驚我軍不可輕視。急令勁旅第九師團赴援。即以師團長植田謙吉爲司令。植田頗自負。臨行時。意氣特豪。對送行者作種種大言。深信渠一到滬。即可逐我軍退出淞滬地域。孰意鏖戰半月。仍遭挫敗。不能得尺寸。迨易以白川義則。人數愈衆。復瞰我瀏河兵薄。密派大軍登陸。拊我軍之背。我軍始不得已全師而退。一夜而至第二道防線。不留一卒。不遺一械。歐美人士咸稱神異。然敵方論功。自歸白川。故於白川彌留之際。日皇行賞。晋封白川爲男爵。而植田不與焉。現植田已歸國。友人函告。謂其人頗愧見昔日送行之親友。有以淞滬戰績爲訽者。輙搖首無語。然則自今而後。日人其敢再驕。視我如無人耶。</p>

<p>昔予習醫日本千葉時。曾聞德國藥物學家某氏演講。中有述及我國之一節。略謂中國因地理上關係。所產藥品。屬於植物類者居多。雖未嘗經科學手續。而其効用。每不弱於歐美純以科學化合而成之礦物藥品。由此可見天然物力之可貴。若再加以人工研究。其所得效果。又當何如。惜乎中國五千年來。祗一神農倘假吾人以十年之暇。遍歷中國。吾知所發藴秘。必有可觀者云云。其辭誇而多譏。深予吾輩以愧恨。但事實如此。當時我國人材之足與發明新藥者。誠百覓而難得其一。迨至晚近。國人漸能表現。滬上一埠。創製新藥以問世者。已有多種。然而失敗者。往往相望。若輩豈皆以僞藥蒙世耶。以予研究所知。頗有數種。遠勝於舶來品。而卒未易成功者。蓋在於創辦人之昧於義利。好大喜功。且於研究之道。不知有所謂精益求精。其失敗宜矣。上海培生製藥公司主人所致力之療肺益金草。吾人早知其發明於數世之前。採運於萬里之外。不惜重大犧牲。務爲病肺者謀一根治良劑。此蓋深合乎歐美創作家不屈不撓之精神者也。予故耿耿於某藥物學家疇昔講演之語。至是乃釋然無憾焉。</p>

<p>— 嚴夢</p>
<p>一星期以前，我承朋友的介紹，專誠到　隆醫院去訪問一位至今仍在臥病的受傷營長。白晳的臉龐，短小精悍的身材，英俊的眉宇，這麽的一個勇敢影子閃入我的眼簾。當我一脚踏入那位忠精的營長的房内。他的眼睛緊閉着，横飛的血肉，斷殘的身軀，交響着的槍砲聲，我擬想，人們殘了的「上海戰爭」印象，永遠地繚繞在他的靈魂，啃嚙他的丹心。「李營長！」我的朋友輕輕地呌他，他睜開朦朧的兩眼，看去他是很費力，然而眼還是惺松。</p>
<p>「哦？誰？你，老麥！」他凝視了好一會，才喊出來。他走近我們，謙和地同我握手，笑，問我的姓名。他熱情地倒開水，要我們坐。談話，不久，我們就成了很熟的朋友。「受傷多少時候？」我關切地問他。</p>
<p>「啊，二月四日的夜深，我便戴花的，很漸愧，很早。」他沉着的回答我。「那兒戴花？」</p>
<p>「摩登小姐戴在鬢旁，少爺戴在禮服的硬胸前。我們，自然戴在皮囊上。我是大腿受傷。他咳嗽了一下，接着説，「本來，我是無須住病院的，無奈我受的是逹姆逹姆彈，你看，我的眼睛還是像個瞎子！」他似乎有點感慨。</p>
<p>「爲國犧牲，爲民族受傷，你營長戴的是不謝的光榮花，應該是無憾了。」我安慰他，用我最崇高的同情。</p>
<p>「我十四歲投軍，是行伍出身的。打了十五年的仗，祇有這一次，我的意識才認爲有意義。内戰與國際戰我都反對，但是鋤强却是眞理，最痛快的正義丨丨那不能説是「國家感情。」我戴花，眞要算這朶是最香，顔色最嬌艶！」</p>
<p>「勝利，原不是戰爭的條件。」李營長似乎有了深刻的感觸，他接着説：「這全不能算是純粹的鬥爭。只是日本兵來打我們，我們硬了頭皮和他打。我們的步槍，燒上四五次就會發熱。戰什麽？他們的飛機一面偵察，一面帮同陸軍戰鬥，還放下凝結不散的烟花，給砲兵作標的。」他開始搖頭，悲壯地在苦笑。停止了他的縣河之口。</p>
<p>那時，寂寞佔據了我們的空間，我怕他傷感起來，連忙問道：「那爲什麽我們可以抵抗了一個多月，而且維持優勢呢？」</p>
<p>「優勢？」他的聲音有點燥，「血肉換來的。交手之初，他們兩人調我們一弟兄。後來是一換一，最後，我們在他們猛烈的砲火壓迫之下，又變成二對他們一了。一月來，用血性來保持中國的人格！唉，可憐的弟兄們，重砲，炸彈的轟擊中，實在是聽死。」</p>
<p>終於，血一様的紅雲染了那位可敬的英雄的眼眶，汪汪的淚光，暴露了人類的眞性情。他的聲音也沙了，「我們没有高射砲，東借西借都借不着，後來幸而得到第五軍的帮助，借給了我們七枝。三枝保護眞茹無線電台，前線的團長也没有一架掩護。在小姐們柔曼的琴音裏，我們是全綫退却了。」</p>
<p>最後，李營長也和我談了不少關於政治的話，一句話做結論，就是大家在搶骨頭。他嚴肅的向我表示，他否認他的戰功，他要尋找他新的生命。我覺得，李營長纔是中國有希望的軍人。功是人家的，罪是我的，那種精神才偉大啊！</p>

<p>長城後之最大工事</p>
<p>六十六萬災工造成</p>
<p>長江從此永泯水災</p>
<p>去年大水爲災、被害者占十六省、人民之蕩析離居者、共有四千七百餘萬、八月二日以後、武漢没入洪水之中、難民之到京滬各地收容者、亦有數十萬名、政府特設水災委員會、撥欵賑濟、一面以工代賑、建造萬里江堤、爲防災之治本計劃、今年江水又繼續增漲、近日大風暴雨、長江水尺又高、人民又慮再受陸沉之禍、但據記者調查所得、水災委員會之萬里江堤、已將完工、從此長江沿岸、永無水災之再見、而本年皖贛鄂各省災區人民、未致全染赤化者、完全賴此長堤之完成、使災區仍可耕植農作也、茲將記者調查所得、詳述如下、</p>
<p>造堤動機　水災委員會附設工賑處、計擬治水工事、聘定席德炯爲總工程師、對於長江各埠之水災淹没、經各地考查結果、以原有江堤之决口倒潰而釀成上年空前的慘禍、今後防災的治本辦法、首將揚子江沿岸江堤重新建造新式之堅固高堤、議定以後、便派工程專家二百六七十名、分往長江上下游、設計造堤工事、</p>
<p>設局董理　設計已定、工賑處便開始工作、將長江堤岸、劃定自上江之沙市起、經漢口·九江·安慶·大通·蕪湖·一直到揚州之十二圩止、蜿蜒一萬餘里、同時並舉、在長江沿岸、特設造堤工賑之監督管理局一十八處、由去冬起、入手建築、一切工務事宜、統歸上海水委員會工賑處管轄、</p>
<p>徴用災工　沿江長堤、在今年春間趕造、由水災委員會選用蘇皖贛鄂之災民六十六萬人、分叚派定興工起築、又用監工委員一千數百名、督率進行、工資一項、就中央向美國購來之賑災麥子及麫粉四十三萬噸以内、撥出一大部、以作造堤之用、其給賑法係用一百立方尺之一方堤岸面積計算、每造一方堤岸、由工賑處給予賑麥七斤半、全堤所發之賑麥、共需數萬噸、</p>
<p>長堤完成　該長堤長度逹一萬數百里、而堤岸之面積、高度有二十餘英尺、堤身工事、又十分堅實、以災工多而又分段造、故迄今已將完全落成、水災委員會在本月月底、因之辦理結束、據該會宣稱、本年江潮雖漲、漢口水量、現爲三下二尺七寸、與去年較、相差尙遠、即使再漲、可保長江沿岸以後永無水災再見矣、</p>
<p>淮河浚導　上年淮河决口、江北亦釀水災、導淮一事、盛唱已久、而無欵進行、遂令兩淮營腴之地、坐令廢棄、今水災會乘長江造堤防災之時、亦由工振處兼派江北災民八萬餘人、實施濬導淮河、並由振麥内撥出一批、交由工振分局負責進行、分局共設三處、水利工程專家、聘用四十餘名、監工人員、亦有二百多名、刻下正在督工開浚之中、從此淮河兩岸數十萬頃荒地、一舉而盡成良田、於國家民衆、均有極大的生產利益也、</p>

<p>— 陸·規·亮·</p>
<p>飛機軋軋，砲聲隆隆，人心惶惶，難友濟濟，二月初旬之松江社會實狀；余偕同邑諸君子：集會討論，分頭募捐，接洽赴申，收容設所，賴羣策羣力，幸底於成，所收難友，由數十，而數百，而二千有奇。所募捐欵，由數十，而數百，而六千以外。難友旣衆，屋小難容，由一所，而二所，而三所，其殷殷然樂輸於本會之才力也，金錢也，米糧也，葷素食物也，衣被等雜用品物也，以團體言，則商界，學界，政界，軍界，警界，以民衆論，則老者，少者，男者，女者，皈依佛敎者，信仰天主耶穌宗敎者，莫不各出其心量財量，口才幹才，聲應氣求，共趨同軌，一致贊同而互助之，吾松江之人心，可謂團結也已。是豈别有作用哉？良以暴日侵陵，禍至無日，同胞被難，痛癢相關，無非根於愛人之良心，發於本善之天性，而不能自己也，然而余深有感者：此次倭寇，未抵松江，而所中所收容者，大都浙之東，江之北，（紗廠工人）蘇屬之寳山嘉定，上海市之閘北江灣（商農兩界）一帶之人。而救濟會所經營布置者，僅百有一日，所支給應用者，僅四千八百餘元，人有餘力，庫有餘財，可謂不幸中之幸焉。方今上無道揆，下無法守，内憂迭起，外患頻仍，駭顧四方，憂心悄悄，凡吾社會同人，果能廉己而愛人，耐勞而盡責，竭熱忱以救急，斥餘財以濟貧，放大目光，不分畛域以互相援助，準斯道也，雖有黨匪之騷擾，宵小之肆行，種種不可思議之變端，必有實力以應付之，而禍可稍減焉，質之有道君子以爲何如？</p>

<p>— 乃徴</p>
<p>講到牠的裏面，因爲新式的收音機把各種機件都放在一起，所以非常複雜，但是大多緊密的置着，地位極省，惟各倍位置，皆經過無線電工程專家，精密設計，並非任意亂七八糟堆置在裏面的，至於綫圈的構造，各件的充分空隙，及正確的距離，皆早先在設計時嚴密的注意了·所以有因磁電氣配合及靜電配合而生的困難之處，亦减少了，各種嘈雜的聲音亦改去了。至於喇叭（或稱擴音器），則在最新式收音機中用新式的動力擴音器，發出的音調清晰響亮，非舊式喇叭等可與之比。牠亦置在裏面的。</p>
<p>新式收音機，牠的便利在用交流電，牠所以能用交流電，不得不歸功於一種新發明的眞空管，牠是用低電壓的交流電，供燈絲的燃燒，但也有一種用電池眞空管，則低電壓交流電通進去，雖能紅亮燈絲，然而没有效能發生，牠必定要直串連接於一種變交流爲直流的器上，（這種器件，稱呌Ｂ式整流器，）而後供給燈絲·現在市上所有新式收音機，差不多都是用交流電眞空管了。</p>
<p>科學一物，是日新月異的進步，無綫電則更在飛一般的猛進·新式收音機在其他各國，早已每家一具，享受無綫電所供給的知識與娛樂了，至於在美國，更加發逹，現在已經有七八家在播送無綫電影（Ｔelevision）了，這種祇能聽不能看的收音機，早已都成爲過去的陳迹了，所以外國廠家都運到我們祇會享受，不會製造的國家來，特别的銷賣，今年起雖然牠的價錢跌得很低，但是我們買他一只收音機，即以數百元雙手奉送給外人，金錢外溢，誠堪痛心，但願望我國製造家速即仿造，挽回利權（完）</p>

<p>— 一·泳·</p>
<p>××女士因爲抱獨身主義未遂而投河自盡了！這消息傳遍了我們的Ｍ村中，</p>
<p>事實是這様的，××女士從小就由父母專主訂婚於同村上的以農爲家的人家，最近××女士的夫家提議要完婚，吉日也已擇定，不料××女士就在將要結婚的前一星期遺書自盡了，信中大致謂誓不嫁人，因爲父母不許的緣故，以致出此下策的，當她父母眞在忙忙碌碌爲她預備妝奩的時候，發現了這様的消息，悲哀得昏厥再三，</p>
<p>不多幾天，我和小妺妺因事到申，突然看見××女士穿了一身入時的時裝，而且還同了一位洋裝少年，手挽手的，且講且談的在踏進××影戲院呢，我那時弄得莫明其妙，我爲了好奇心所驅使，偷偷的緊跟在她們的背後，</p>
<p>「我爲了你而假裝投河自盡，我爲了你而自願離間我的父母，冒了大不孝的美名，我爲了你······」××女士說着說着，她的頭一些一些的傍靠在少年的肩上了，</p>
<p>「Ｏh　ｍｙ　Ｄearest一切我都知道了，你爲我犧牲一切，我當然也願意犧牲一切爲你，明天我們還是快快離開上海吧，一月以後，我們可以實行同居，來完滿我們的愛情吧，」洋裝少年，摸摩着××女士手指，輕輕的說着</p>
<p>我聽了她們的一翻談話，方才如夢初醒，恍然大悟，但是我的小妺妺拖了我的手，硬要我快走，於是我默然不語的，走到我們所欲到的地方去了，</p>

<p>— 天·方·</p>
<p>我的朋友老王生了一個兒子，昨天送來一個請帖和一盒紅蛋，八個。那請帖上這様寫着：</p>
<p>「謹詹×月×日爲小兒××彌月，敬治湯餅，恭請闔第光臨！」底下是「××拜」與「席設××樓。」</p>
<p>我不懂，他生了孩子爲什麽要請人家喝酒？要是說慶祝，那末所慶何在？倘爲「添丁之喜，」但是添丁是否可喜，還是一個問題，况且事實多數歡喜得來的百姓，都是製成砲灰或是塡之溝壑了，二十年來因天災人禍的緣故，人口已不知損失了多少。丨隴海一戰，所犧牲的戰士，足以建立一個小小的國家。假如說是「財丁兩旺，」「家門有慶」的話，那末你又怎様知道這個孩子的將來定爲國家謀福利，爲社會偉人呢？說不定是墮落或是賣國做奸商爲後人吐駡呢？所以即使要慶祝，也應在「功成名遂」之日，而决不是在彌月之朝。再說是想借此機會，和幾個朋友喝一杯酒，那末「聚餐會」也興，何必拿小孩子來做題目，我送禮物，你辦筵席，兩不經濟，只落了銀樓酒館的便宜呢？不如把湯餅會的筵席費來培植自己和其他的孩子們，那末將來的慶祝，豈不是較可靠些。總之我尋不出這事可慶的究竟，與應請我喝酒的理由。有之，在家庭之内多了一様點綴品，一個玩物。如添了一架留聲機或是一只能言的鸚鵡一様，是父親和祖父母的消遣品。另一意義是借此可以在朋友面前「裝闊。」總之與蒙昩無知的小孩子是全不相干的一回事，這是有錢的大人們的玩意兒。</p>
<p>拿小孩當家庭中紙花盆栽様的點綴品，或是狸奴小狗様的玩物，小孩才糟。我做小孩，就應抗議。</p>

<p>××滑稽班在××戲院公演，朋友來拉我去看，我爲消閒公餘的沉悶，五個月來不踏進過的娛樂塲終於踏進了。</p>
<p>演的劇名是「天下第一橋」，這是一幕玩雜耍的客串，所謂「三百六十行」便是。當然，那臺上劇員所演的，在在都使人忍俊不禁，尤其是說白的靈佻，實給吾以深切的暗示，丨雖然所說的全是些「滑稽」腔，可是那却不僅是供人「笑」而已，它且含有敎訓的意味在。</p>
<p>臺上是這様演着：一個呌化逍遙地在引吭高歌，一個路人見了便帶着冷誚而厭憎的口氣說：「窮呌化！窮到這個模様，還要這般的窮開心！」</p>
<p>呌化聽了抗聲說道：「你不要趾高氣揚的瞧不起窮人，說不定你將來也要到像我這般地步。」</p>
<p>路人怒目相視呌化？一會傲然説道：「呸！我錦衣玉食，有錢有勢，窮到那裏去？」</p>
<p>「哼！你現在的地位，正是我過去的前身。」呌化用輕薄的口吻，沉著而感慨的說：「呵呵！講給你聽，我已往一様還比你顯赫哩！可是淪做呌化却是第二次了。」</p>
<p>呌化再用悔恨的調子說道：「我當初本也是窮呌化出身，後來得人憐憫收容，便慢慢的上進，不多幾時，居然能自立，於是娶妻買屋，一直又很順利，掙了些錢，就做投機生意，結果徼倖獲了勝算，這時就非同小可，造洋房，坐汽車，納嬌妾，一様一様的幹起來，對於一般舊日窮友，一槪都瞧他們不起，丨正是同你現在瞧不起我一様，丨看見那些逹官貴人，倒著實巴結一番，因覺得有了他們，便有靠山，什麽事都可肆無忌憚的幹，那時有了相當名望，偶地做件拆爛汚事件，誰也奈何我不得，眞個萬分自在，終日吃吃逛逛，舞場賭窟，何日不到？整日價過「大老闆」生活。豈知世間事脱不了循環的定例，我在「富貴」中正兜了半個圈子，畢竟金錢有限，命運有限，到後來爲幹了一件賄賂的公事，被人控告，於是吃官司，吃官司要靠手面闊不闊，對方勝過於我，何况我本已理屈，終至身繫囹圄，家財抄没，身敗名裂，走頭無路，想來眞彷彿在社會裏淴一個浴，結果仍落得這個模様，還我本來面目，仍淪呌化度日······那你現在倨身自高，實在太無意識了。」呌化說定，一陣獰笑。</p>
<p>「······」路人想了一會，憬然說道：「富人别瞧不起窮人，窮人别嫉視富人。」</p>
<p>一席話却引得臺下的我暗下唏嘘著</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Issue of Japan's Seizure of Northeast China's Customs Revenue <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the so-called Manchurian puppet state, following the instructions of the Japanese, first stopped remitting the customs revenue of Northeast China, excluding Dalian, to the Inspectorate General of Customs. Subsequently, the puppet Minister of Finance, Xi Qia, used the pretext of establishing tariff autonomy to declare preparations to seize all customs revenue of Dalian and other customs offices. Now, they have already implemented the act of diverting the tax revenue from Binjiang and Andong, actively proceeding to seize all customs revenue of Northeast China. Everyone should know that the main actor in this matter is Japan. The so-called Manchurian puppet state is nothing more than a group of puppets being driven around. Therefore, the one seizing the Northeast China's customs revenue is, rather than the so-called Manchurian puppet state, better described as Japan.</p>
<p>The Northeast Customs has a total of six offices, including Aihui, Binjiang, Hunchun, Yanji, Andong, and Dalian. The annual tax revenue reaches over 20 million taels of customs silver, approximately 15% of the total customs revenue of our country. Moreover, in terms of trade, only the Northeast corner of our country has an annual trade surplus. Therefore, the seizure of Northeast China's customs revenue has a significant impact on our country's finances.</p>
<p>On the 20th, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen issued a declaration regarding this issue. He stated that our country's customs revenue is the main artery of domestic and foreign debt credit, that customs revenue is significantly related to foreign debt, and that the integrity of our customs revenue is being undermined. He appealed to the great powers to pay close attention to this "cruel act of destroying the debt repayment ability of four hundred million people." At the same time, the United States has already issued a note of protest to Japan, and the United Kingdom will also issue a similar protest. This is not merely speaking up for justice, nor is it particularly loving our country; it is protesting for its own interests. Our country cannot maintain its sovereignty with its own strength. The loss of the Northeast, with appeals for help made to this day, has yielded no results. Now, we are again appealing to the great powers instead of resisting with our own strength. Nothing could be more tragic and painful than this.</p>
<p>The loss of the Northeast is the realization of Japan's so-called continental policy. The establishment of the Manchurian puppet state is merely a smokescreen to obscure international scrutiny. If our country cannot recover the lost territories soon, the realization of Japan's assimilation of Manchuria will be imminent. Looking at the conversations about free ports and tariff issues in a one-act play on the Manchurian issue held by Tokyo's government and public in the past month, Asahi reporter Wada said, "Other countries sometimes close their doors to Japan. Japan and Manchuria can also use this relationship to close themselves off to the outside world." Also, the secretary-general of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Fengtian said, "According to the methods set by the new country, import and export taxes will naturally be completely abolished." This shows that Japan's purpose in seizing Northeast China's customs revenue is, first, to build a tariff barrier and close it off to the outside world, and second, to completely abolish export taxes and seize cheap raw materials. In reality, the entire Northeast has already been completely controlled by Japan. Therefore, it is only natural that they demand whatever they want regarding customs revenue. There is nothing strange about it. The only thing is that we, in this situation, should recognize that the customs issue and the Northeast issue are one and the same. Only by recovering the lost territories of the Northeast can the customs issue be resolved. Moreover, compared to the Northeast's half of our country's land, the annual customs revenue of over 20 million taels of customs silver is less important. If we continue to sit idly by and watch the loss of half of our country's land without urgently recovering it, what is the point of these over 20 million taels of customs revenue? If we are unwilling to sit idly by, if we are unwilling to see our country fragmented and our people humiliated, then recovering the lost territories is even more urgent than fighting for the return of customs revenue. If the lost territories are recovered, then the customs revenue will also be recovered. The help of others is ultimately uncertain; only self-help can save us. This is what our government and our people should recognize and be aware of most today.</p>
<p>On the 21st, former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Ishii, while welcoming the new American envoy, advocated that "Japan is carrying out its peaceful and natural development in Asia, and American intervention is unnecessary, just as Japan does not need to interfere in the Western Hemisphere." The New York Times called it the exposure of the Asian Monroe Doctrine. It is indeed a fool's dream for Japan to want to realize the Asian Monroe Doctrine. However, from Ishii's speech, Japan's ambitious aspirations are already evident. There will be many difficulties in the future; it is not just the current plunder of Northeast China's customs revenue. If we cannot rely on our own strength to seek self-defense and self-salvation, what can we imagine for the future?</p>

<p>Envoys to Convene Joint Meeting in Days</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo in Beiping has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Charge d'Affaires Yano, protesting Japan's instigation of rebels to seize customs revenue, and has informed the envoys of the relevant countries. The full text of the protest and the notification will be published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 24th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Envoys' news, the envoys of various countries, because Japan instigated the puppet state to split the Dalian Customs with the Chinese government, with the remaining seven million taels each month, are scheduled to convene a joint meeting in days to discuss this matter. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important figure in financial circles said that the rebels' seizure of the customs revenue of the eastern provinces was undoubtedly instigated by the Japanese, and Japan cannot shirk its responsibility. The rebel organization was entirely handled by the Japanese, and all measures were initiated behind the scenes by the Japanese. Moreover, Dalian is territory leased by our country to Japan, and now the Dalian customs revenue has also been seized, which is a direct action by the Japanese side. The customs revenue of the eastern provinces reaches over 30 million yuan annually, and many of our domestic and foreign debts are mortgaged on customs revenue. Now, the sudden loss of this huge amount has caused great difficulties for our country's finances. The central government will never recognize the rebel actions instigated by the Japanese and will definitely seek good strategies to recover it. As for the Japanese rumors about convening a meeting of envoys from various countries stationed in China to discuss methods for dealing with Dalian Customs, except for the part for repaying the debt, which must not be moved as usual, the rest will be split equally by our country and the rebels. This absurd proposition violates our sovereignty and integrity, and we will never recognize it, and other countries will certainly not agree. In short, this is just one part of the problem in the eastern provinces. To fundamentally resolve it, the best policy is to recover the eastern provinces. Furthermore, reporters have learned that the customs offices in the eastern provinces are Aihui, Binjiang, Huichun, Yanji, Andong, and Dalian, with a total tax revenue of 21,146,720.0789 taels in the 19th year. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the puppet state's takeover of the Northeast Customs and the transfer of deposits, Finance Minister Song has issued a report from Niuzhuang and Andong. According to news from the Ministry of Finance, the Dalian Customs Commissioner has also sent a telegram to the Inspectorate General. There are no official reports from Yingkou, Shenyang, Binjiang, Shanhaiguan, and Aihui. It has been found that the Dalian Customs is in the Japanese concession and its organization is of a special nature, with only the Inspectorate General and no Customs Superintendent. Reports from Tokyo say that the Japanese will seek a solution to the Dalian Customs issue, hoping to shirk international responsibility, which is absolutely unacceptable. Furthermore, the government will submit this matter to the State Council meeting on the 24th for detailed discussion to determine the entire response method, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will lodge a serious protest with Japan. Furthermore, the Bank of China branches in various places, which keep the Northeast tax deposits, have also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance one after another, reporting the process of Japanese forcing the various Commissioners to transfer the deposits and describing the resistance to illegal transfers. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The salt inspection offices in various places in the Northeast were forcibly taken over by personnel sent by the puppet state under the direction of the Japanese. All Chinese and foreign staff have been forced to leave various places in the Northeast. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Puppet State Disrupts Finance <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The puppet Northeast government recently ordered the puppet Central Bank to issue 200 million yuan in paper money, divided into five types: 50 cents, 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, and 50 yuan. At the same time, silver coins were minted to replenish cash. The Ministry of Finance believes that this move disrupts national finance and concerns international views. On the 23rd, it submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to seek response methods as soon as possible and consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to Japan.

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhaoming, Luo Wengan, and Zeng Zhongming arrived at Pukou at 6:00 PM on the 23rd by special train. Gu Mengyu, Chen Bijun, Xu Mo, and others crossed the river to welcome them. After Wang and others got off the train, they took the Chengping ferry across the river into the city. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Wang Jingwei returned to his residence, Gu Mengyu, Chen Gongbo, Chen Shuren, Huang Shaoxiong, Li Jishen, Chen Fumu, Xu Mo, Zhu Jiahua, Shao Yuanchong, and others, more than ten people in total, met with Wang. Wang spoke for a long time about his meetings with Zhang Xueliang and the investigation team and left everyone for the convenience. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>(Jinan) At 8:30 PM, Wang Jingwei, Luo Wengan, and Zeng Zhongming's special train arrived in Jinan. Han and all the important party, government, and military figures, more than a hundred people, went to the station to welcome them. Security was very tight from the station to the provincial government. When the train arrived at the station, military music was played loudly. Han and other welcomers boarded the train, shook hands with Wang and others, and exchanged greetings. Wang asked about Han's foot ailment, and Han replied that it was fine. He had originally wanted to go to Beijing to visit him earlier. Han invited Wang and others to the provincial government for a short rest. Wang did not get off the train but spoke with reporters in the train. The reporters asked: (1) After meeting with Deputy Commander Zhang, what is the situation with the Northeast issue? Wang replied that he exchanged opinions with Zhang on the transfer of military power in the Northeast, which was very satisfactory. (2) What was the result of meeting the investigation team in Beiping? He replied that he had met with the team twice. They told me about the progress of the investigation, and I told them the government's views. There was a full and detailed exchange of views. (3) Is Gu going to Japan with the investigation team? He replied that it has been decided not to go because he heard that Japan was not welcoming him. Previously, when the team went to the Northeast, the rebels rejected Gu. At that time, the government telegraphed Gu to go because the Northeast is our country's territory. The rebels, even if they want to receive him, will not be welcomed. Even if he suffers all kinds of insults and impolite treatment after going, it doesn't matter. Japan is an equal country, not a puppet state. Usually, if two countries send an envoy, and one country does not welcome them, they cannot go. This time, not welcoming Gu is the same. Moreover, in fact, there is no need to go because the team is going to Japan to exchange opinions with the Japanese government. Our country cannot participate. Just like when the team came to Nanjing to exchange opinions with the government, and this time when I met with the team in Beiping, Yoshida was not present. (4) What are you discussing with Han in Jinan? He replied, I wanted to come to Jinan earlier to meet with Chairman Han. That's why I flew to Beiping and specially sent a special train to Beiping to prepare to come to Jinan to meet. Because I was passing through Jinan along the way, it was right to meet. Second, I will report the experience of meeting with the investigation team to Han. (5) Did you see Feng in Tai'an? He replied that he will arrive in Tai'an tonight, but it must be late at night, and it is not convenient to disturb him. I am preparing to leave a letter for him because I must rush to Beijing for the Executive Yuan meeting early Friday. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Cheng Xixian, representing Shi Yousan, met with Wang. At 9:00, Wang, Luo, and Zeng rode in a car with Han to the provincial government. Han set up a Chinese lunch in his office to welcome Wang and the other three, inviting only Zhang Weicun, a member of the Provincial Restructuring Committee, to accompany them. Wang and others were scheduled to leave Jinan at 11:00 PM. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Wang Jingwei said to Han yesterday that relying on others will ultimately be useless. In the future, the government will make a determination, using military force to deal with military affairs and diplomacy to deal with diplomatic affairs. Han said that he is willing to end internal strife forever and unite against foreign enemies. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, at the provincial government meeting, Wang Jingwei reported on the central government's military and diplomatic plans after the Lushan Conference and the experience of meeting with Zhang and the investigation team in Beiping. Han Fuju reported on the province's military and political affairs, and Zhang Weicun reported on the province's party affairs and asked for instructions on everything. Wang expressed satisfaction with the province's party, military, and political affairs, especially the results of the opium suppression, which were the best in the country. Wang entrusted Han to deliver a letter to Feng. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 10:40, Wang went from the provincial government to the station. Han and others sent him off at the station. At 11:00, the original train went south. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Wang Jingwei's special train passed through Xu and went south at 8:30 AM on the 23rd, stopping at the station for only 15 minutes. Luo Wengan and Zeng Zhongming were traveling together. Zeng told reporters that Wang's trip to Beiping to discuss diplomacy and military affairs with Zhang had yielded satisfactory results. When passing through Shandong, because time was pressing, he did not have time to meet with Feng. He left a letter to Han to forward, so the special train did not stop when passing through Tai'an. He rushed back to Beijing. North China is now very stable. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

He believes that the matter will be resolved soon. The country has reached such a point, how can we indulge in private struggles? Sun Ke went to Guangdong. I visited him in Shanghai the other day, but Sun was ill and did not meet him. I heard that Sun is going to Hong Kong, first visiting Hu Hanmin, and then going to Macau to visit his mother. He does not plan to go to Guangzhou on this trip. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Wang issued the following statement to reporters: (Q) What was the result of the meeting with Director Zhang? (A) There was some discussion about national defense, but it has not been announced. (Q) What was the result of meeting with the League of Nations investigation team? (A) I asked the League of Nations investigation team about their feelings upon returning from the Northeast and continued to discuss the points raised in Nanjing. (Q) Is it true that Representative Gu has decided not to go to Japan? (A) I and Minister Luo have already issued a statement on this matter in Beiping. (1) This time, the investigation team went to Japan to exchange opinions with the Japanese government, and Representative Gu was originally not required to participate, just as Representative Yoshida did not participate in our talks with the investigation team when he came to Beijing. (2) However, when Representative Yoshida came to Beijing, our side treated him with friendship and courtesy. However, this time, Japan has indicated that it will not receive Representative Gu. It should be noted that Representative Gu's trip to Japan this time is different from his trip to the Northeast. The Northeast is our country's territory, and the puppet government is regarded as nothing by our side. We cannot not go because of their various obstacles, so the government still urged Representative Gu to go, and Representative Gu resolutely took on the task. Japan is a country. Since it has indicated that it will not receive Representative Gu, he naturally does not need to go. (Q) Did you meet with Han and Feng when passing through Shandong? (A) Yesterday afternoon at 9:00, I met Han in Jinan. Because it was the first time we met, the conversation lasted a long time. At 11:00, I left Jinan and passed through Tai'an. I originally planned to visit Feng, but it was already 2:00 AM. It was very inconvenient to go up the mountain, and since Feng was recuperating, it was not convenient to ask him to come down the mountain. If I had to meet, I would have to stay for a day, and I was afraid that I would not be able to make it to the Executive Yuan meeting on Friday, so I just left a letter to greet him and did not have time to meet. (Q) Does the Northeast Volunteer Army have any relationship with the government? (A) The organization and distribution of the Northeast Volunteer Army are not connected to the government because of traffic inconvenience, but the Volunteer Army is completely an expression of the people's patriotism, fighting alone and extremely hard. The government certainly cannot sit idly by. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei replied to a reporter from a certain agency, saying that the failure to ban opium in various places in recent years has become an open secret. In this time of extreme financial exhaustion for the country, it is better to implement open suppression in taxation. On the one hand, it is convenient for statistics in the implementation of prohibition, and on the other hand, it provides a source of income to alleviate current difficulties, so there are many people who advocate this. However, the central government has not yet made a decision because of the great importance of the matter. If there are still other remedies, it is unwilling to implement this last policy. However, it depends on people. If it is handled properly, it may not be impossible to implement. Looking at various countries, such as England in India and the United States in the Philippines, their prohibition of opium also adopts the policy of suppression in taxation. Its effect is not as bad as generally imagined. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

In addition to expressing thanks for the team's long journey, he also made some statements on resolving the Northeast issue. The team's opinions were well received. At the request of the Japanese government, the investigation team decided to extend its stay to the east. During this period, the team members will fully study the knot of the Northeast issue. Since Representative Gu was rejected by the Japanese, our side decided to cancel his trip because there was no absolute necessity for him to travel together. The completion of the investigation team's report is still awaited, and the League of Nations General Assembly has been slightly extended, but it is scheduled to be held in September. Our country's diplomatic policy should rely on our own efforts and cannot depend on others. The diplomatic policy has been announced as much as possible, but the implementation strategies and operational steps still need to be dealt with at any time and cannot be disclosed to the outside world in advance. I hope the people will understand. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Statement by Song Ziwen</p>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The establishment of the Dalian Customs was based on the agreement signed on May 30, 1907, by Sir Robert Hart, Inspector General of Customs, and the Japanese Minister to China. The establishment of this agreement arose from the fact that Liaodong was a leased territory and the aforementioned lease. As long as the current status of Liaodong continues to exist, in other words, as long as Liaodong continues to be managed by the Japanese, this special situation is a condition to preserve China's right to establish customs at the border to levy taxes on goods transported from Liaodong to the interior and from the interior to Liaodong. If "Manchukuo" or the Japanese authorities interfere with Dalian, China can demand compensation for all losses incurred due to the deduction of Dalian customs duties. The leased territory of Liaodong is managed by the Japanese government, and the Japanese government should earnestly protect the integrity of Dalian Customs and bear the responsibility for any interference in the leased territory that leads to the destruction of Dalian Customs. This is very clear if you refer to the following provisions of the 1907 Sino-Japanese Customs Agreement: (1) The Dalian Customs Commissioner shall be appointed by the Inspector General of Customs, but shall be a Japanese person. Without the permission of the Inspector General, he shall not be arbitrarily appointed. The agreement stipulates that in order to meet the "existing needs of the Customs," the Inspector General of Customs may appoint personnel of other nationalities to serve in Dalian Customs in addition to Japanese personnel. (2) Dalian Customs shall be responsible for collecting customs duties and implementing the "tariff regulations currently implemented in all commercial ports in China." In order to guarantee the implementation of the above regulations, the Japanese authorities should find ways to prevent smuggling from the leased territory to the Chinese interior and assist the Chinese authorities in implementing their measures to prevent smuggling from the Chinese interior to the leased territory. (3) The agreement of July 6, 1898, stipulates that "Dalian Customs shall be under the full management of the Beijing government." It is very clear that this provision remains valid according to the 1907 agreement. According to this provision, the Inspector General has the right to apply various regulations on tariffs and customs deposit banks and remittances that are commonly used in other parts of China to Dalian Customs, subject only to the conditions specifically agreed upon between China and Japan. If the above agreement is not complied with, the Chinese government may legally consider the Japanese government to be fully responsible for the situation that caused this to happen. According to the provisions of the existing Sino-Japanese agreement, if the Japanese authorities or any third party interfere in any way with the administration of Dalian Customs, it is clearly a destruction of the Chinese customs system, which will affect not only China but also other countries. The income of Dalian Customs occupies a significant part of the total Chinese customs revenue, which has always been used as a guarantee for foreign debts. Moreover, interference with Dalian Customs will endanger the integrity of Chinese customs. The great powers have always paid close attention to Chinese customs, and their attention to Dalian Customs can be proved by the events before the establishment of the customs. Dalian Customs was established about two years after the Russo-Japanese War. During these two years, Japanese goods were freely imported into the three northeastern provinces from Dalian without paying import duties. British and American foreign merchants were at a disadvantage. The opening of the gateway to the three northeastern provinces was obviously destroyed, causing various countries to protest to both China and Japan, demanding the immediate establishment of customs at Dalian. The Chinese government, in view of its concern for its external obligations, and in view of the discriminatory malpractices before the establishment of Dalian Customs under the jurisdiction of the Inspector General of Customs, and the current tendency to restore them, has to pay serious attention, it is said.

<p>(Shenyang) Japanese Vice Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Mazaki arrived in Shenyang yesterday afternoon, ostensibly to inspect the situation in the false country as a reference for recognition. In fact, he carries with him military issues concerning Russia and China. There are two types of military issues concerning Russia: (1) the point of invading Russian interests in northern Manchuria, which will lead to trouble with Russia; (2) issues such as the border between Russia and Korea and the border between the Northeast and Korea. The power of the Korean Independence Party is growing daily, and incidents often occur in Korea. As for military issues concerning China, the Japanese army is exhausted from running around in various parts of the Northeast due to the uprisings of the volunteer armies. In addition, during the period when sorghum is lush, aircraft cannot exert their killing power, and it is difficult for the Japanese army to fight. It is reported that the Japanese army will disturb Rehe and Guan Nei, intending to have the puppet army attack Guan Nei, and then the Japanese army will take the opportunity to maintain North China and launch military operations in coordination with the rebel army to defeat Zhang Xueliang. At the same time, they will take Rehe, cut off the connection between the volunteer army and Guan Nei, making the volunteer army isolated and unable to fight for long. This kind of military operation is likely to occur within one or two months. The purpose of this trip by Vice Chief of Staff Mazaki is not only related to military plans against Russia, but also to the peace of our North China. (United Press dispatch of the 23rd)</p>

Lin De visited Shi Luben on the 19th, and was received by Sugihara, the Japanese Director-General. Lin De said that he had interviewed news during the war in Shanghai and entered and exited both sides' positions without being restricted. Why was he restricted in Harbin? Sugihara said that he had not obtained permission from Manchukuo to meet with Ma Zhanshan and must apologize to Manchukuo. After a long negotiation, Lin De left.

<p>Advocating a General Reduction of World Armaments by One-Third</p>
<p>All Countries Unanimously Support, While France and Japan Hold Different Views</p>
<p>Geneva, National News Agency, 22nd: The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference held a special meeting this afternoon. Chairman Henderson strongly stated that the committee had fallen into a state of drift and it was necessary to try to save it. Then, American representative Gibson stood up and read President Hoover's instructions to him, proposing a general reduction of world armaments by one-third. Hoover stated in his instructions that the Briand-Kellogg Pact had greatly reduced its value in the international arena because all countries claimed that their armaments were purely for self-defense. Therefore, the United States not only advocates a general reduction of existing armaments, but also suggests that more self-defense weapons and fewer aggressive weapons should be placed within the new standards in the future. The specific plan proposed by Hoover includes: (1) abolishing tanks, bombers, and mobile artillery, and prohibiting chemical and bacterial warfare and aerial bombing; (2) reducing the strength of troops by one-third; (3) reducing the tonnage and number of all capital ships previously stipulated in the treaty by another one-third, reducing cruisers and auxiliary ships by another one-quarter, and the tonnage of submarines shall not exceed 35,000 tons. The American president also strongly stated in his instructions that this plan will definitely achieve great results in saving finances.</p>
<p>Britain Suspects the American Proposal is Not Thorough Enough. Reuter's, Geneva, 22nd: After the American representative announced this proposal, it immediately made a deep impression on the General Committee. British Foreign Secretary Simon was the first to speak, saying that the British government would give this proposal very careful consideration. Britain wants to see a greater reduction in naval forces in certain points than what President Hoover proposed, such as submarines. Britain advocates the abolition of submarines, he said. Simon also said that the reduction in the tonnage of capital ships was not mentioned. He advocated that when the London Treaty of 1937 allows countries to rebuild capital ships, countries should agree that the tonnage of each capital ship should not exceed 25,000 tons, and the main guns should not exceed 12 inches. He hoped that the tonnage of various warships could be reduced accordingly, he said.</p>
<p>Italy Accepts Unconditionally. Italian representative Grandi then spoke, saying that he announced in the name of Mussolini that Italy fully accepted the American proposal. The Italian foreign minister explained each point proposed by President Hoover one by one, earnestly stating that Italy accepted it without conditions. After these words were spoken, the whole audience applauded and cheered, which was rare in the League of Nations meeting place.</p>
<p>France Reveals an Attitude of Opposition. French representative Penguel spoke, and although his intention to oppose the American president's proposal was extremely concealed, it was ultimately revealed. Peng repeatedly mentioned the issue of security, saying that proportional disarmament would harm the interests of small countries. If the Disarmament Conference discusses President Hoover's proposal, it should also consider the French proposal for an international army, he said. Peng concluded by saying that the American proposal can get France's sympathetic consideration.</p>
<p>Litvinov's Words Contain Sarcasm. Soviet Russian representative Litvinov spoke with sarcasm, saying that today's meeting reminded the participants that they are still members of the Disarmament Conference, which is very welcome.</p>
<p>Germany Eagerly Desires Equality in Armaments. German representative Nadoni expressed his satisfaction with President Hoover's advocacy of substantive disarmament, hoping that it would ultimately save the failure of the conference, and stated that he welcomed President Hoover's statement that the German army, whose number of armaments is restricted by the Treaty of Versailles, can be used as the basis for calculating the strength of the armies of other countries. However, he believed that President Hoover's theory that disarmament should not disturb the balance of power between countries should be slightly lenient and allow some exceptions for countries that have already reduced their armaments. In short, the more substantive and stringent the disarmament, the easier the issue of equality will be resolved, and establishing the principle of equality is one of the most important conditions for the success of the conference.</p>
<p>Matsudaira Publicly Supports France. Japanese representative Matsudaira spoke, saying that Japan is prepared to cooperate in studying the American proposal, which must be carefully considered so that it can protect the defense of the countries concerned in an appropriate form, he said.</p>
<p>Representatives of Small Countries Unanimously Support. About 20 small countries participating in the meeting unanimously supported Italy and Germany, unconditionally accepting the American proposal, but everyone felt that it would be difficult to dispel the opposition. The Disarmament Conference has now adjourned, and the date of the next meeting has not been decided.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 22nd: President Hoover issued a formal statement from the White House, saying that his disarmament proposal can not only relieve countries of the heavy burden of armaments and their maintenance costs, but also eliminate a large part of the ship construction procedures currently in Congress. This proposal can give the United States an agreed military force within three years, without interfering with existing construction or reducing the number of active personnel. Disarmament is not linked to war debts, he said. The American president also explained the following points: (1) The Kellogg-Briand Pact can only be interpreted as the countries of the world having agreed to use their military force only in national defense; (2) The implementation of disarmament is not only in the general reduction of armaments, but also in reducing offensive power, so as to increase defensive power; (3) The expansion of world armaments arises from the relative nature of each other. Generally speaking, this relative nature must still be preserved in disarmament; (4) Disarmament must be genuine and substantive, and must first have the effect of economic liberation; (5) The difficulties of the army, navy, and air force are mutually linked. We can improve the guarantee of peace on the one hand, and save the world 10,000,000,000,000 to 15,000,000,000,000 yuan of waste in the next ten years on the other hand.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 22nd: According to reliable sources, President Hoover has no intention of taking unilateral action if other major countries do not accept the American proposal. Furthermore, the American proposal is not related to war debt reduction. The American president believes that linking this proposal with the reduction of war debts may hinder the dignity of European countries. Officials estimate that if the American president's proposal is implemented, the United States can save 2,000,000,000,000 yuan in the next ten years.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Actual Impact on Naval Powers <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd - The actual impact of President Hoover's disarmament plan regarding naval strength reduction is as follows: (1) The United States and Great Britain will be on equal footing in terms of cruisers, each allowed 250,000 tons, and Japan will be allowed 150,000 tons; (2) The United States will dismantle battleships (five ships) totaling 100,500 tons, submarines totaling 35,000 tons, and destroyers totaling 165,000 tons, while adding cruisers totaling 35,000 tons and aircraft carriers totaling 9,000 tons; (3) Great Britain will dismantle battleships totaling 123,000 tons, aircraft carriers totaling 14,000 tons, cruisers totaling 120,000 tons, destroyers totaling 82,000 tons, and submarines totaling 25,000 tons; (4) Japan will dismantle battleships totaling 88,000 tons, cruisers totaling 77,000 tons, aircraft carriers totaling 8,000 tons, destroyers totaling 40,000 tons, and submarines totaling 45,000 tons.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Japanese Military Expresses Absolute Opposition <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd - Army Minister Araki declared to the press today that President Hoover's disarmament proposal is impossible for Japan to accept. He stated that a reduction in armaments at the same rate cannot be applied to all countries, as each country's special circumstances must be considered. Araki also stated that Japan must pay attention to its unique position, namely its proximity to China and Russia.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd - Naval officials, commenting on President Hoover's disarmament proposal as reported in the newspapers, stated that Japan is generally prepared to support the abolition of chemical warfare, aerial bombardment of cities, and the reduction of aircraft carriers. However, they are very doubtful about whether bomber aircraft should be abolished. As for significantly reducing battleships and cruisers, they are absolutely opposed. Army authorities are doubtful about whether President Hoover's proposal can be implemented, viewing it as almost as impossible as the Soviet Union's proposal for complete disarmament. They also suspect President Hoover's sincerity, believing that his main goal in putting forward this proposal is to gain popularity in the presidential election. Political circles seem to view President Hoover's disarmament proposal as too excessive and difficult to fully accept, but admire it greatly and believe it deserves very full consideration. However, they also stated that the authorities have not yet had time to study it in detail. Judging from the appearance, Japan must wait for other major powers to express their opinions before announcing its position. However, the authorities have hinted that (1) Japan's attitude will largely depend on the attitude of the Soviet Union; (2) Japan's views on disarmament have always been based on the safety of Japanese interests in Manchuria; as for war debts and reparations that affect Europe, they are not Japan's concern; (3) If the naval armaments of Great Britain, the United States, and Japan are on an equal footing, then Japan is prepared to agree to a mutual reduction of one-third. However, Japan's current naval strength is already inferior to that of other countries, and it may not be able to withstand a further reduction of one-third. As for battleships, Japan can agree to complete abolition to be equal with all countries, but cannot agree to a reduction of one-third, which would make its strength far inferior to others.</p>
<h3 id="e77">US Proposal Leaves Room for Concessions <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 23rd - This morning, all newspapers predicted that President Hoover's disarmament proposal would face many obstacles, but they also emphasized that the proposal leaves room for compromise and concessions. The New York Times published an editorial, focusing particularly on France, praising the plan and recalling that Japan had previously opposed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which the United States and France had strongly promoted, and the United States had agreed to join in any action to protect any country subjected to aggression.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd - The repercussions of President Hoover's proposal (which is not entirely his personal opinion) in Geneva are, according to a report by American representative Gibson to Stimson via transatlantic telephone yesterday, better than he had expected. Democratic Senator Robinson expressed his opinion, saying that this plan is a practical touchstone for the disarmament conference. However, diplomatic circles regard it as a ruse, believing that if it is rejected by European countries and talks break down, the United States can disclaim responsibility. Moreover, they believe that the United States will then close the door on all requests for the cancellation of war debts, as the European powers have rejected the use of disarmament to implement economic remedies.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Glimpses of British and French Newspaper Opinions <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - British newspapers mostly regard President Hoover's disarmament proposal as a courageous and inspiring plan with many strengths that can serve as a basis for action. The Times stated that the proposal is "sharply worded and broad in scope," including points that are most agreeable to everyone in Geneva. Regarding the sections on land armaments, the British Empire has no doubts about them, but the proposals regarding naval armaments, once officially studied, will be of the utmost concern to Britain. The newspaper continued, stating that one of the most powerful reasons for endorsing Hoover's proposal is that if this proposal is effectively supplemented, it will make violations of the Kellogg-Briand Pact virtually impossible. Other Conservative newspapers have expressed support for this proposal, but extreme conservatives say that excessively reducing the only tool currently preventing war may not be a true economic measure. Liberals call the proposal a solemn leadership and urge France to do its part. Laborites express happiness with this proposal, which they consider practical, but do not approve of British Foreign Secretary Simon's "ambiguous" attitude. There is a pessimistic tone in some quarters here, viewing the American disarmament proposals as an interventionist move and a cause of obstructing the success of the Lausanne Conference, believing that France may not approve the American plan. Foreign Secretary Simon's return to London can be seen as a sign that the British cabinet attaches importance to the American proposal.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris - The Paris evening newspapers have criticized President Hoover's proposal to drastically reduce armaments, all stating that France cannot accept it under any circumstances. The Paris Evening News also stated that Hoover's new plan is merely a tactical maneuver, and even those who propose this plan may not be confident that it will succeed. It also said that this plan, while seemingly very important, is not necessarily so in its essence. With the American presidential election imminent, no one can guarantee that the next president or the next Congress will follow this plan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 23rd - Le Journal states that the only satisfaction that most French newspapers have gained from President Hoover's disarmament proposal is that Great Britain, which has always been quite compliant to the United States, has now expressed "active independence." The newspaper called Simon's speech "a funeral among flowers" and said that President Hoover's use of Geneva for his election campaign is not a great pity, as Briand also had a good opportunity to restate France's theories. Those who unconditionally support President Hoover are all countries seeking to revise the peace treaty. The "truly indecent" applause received by Grandi's speech is a clear submission of Europe to the United States.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Proposes Treaty Among Four European Nations</p>
<p>Britain and France Exchange Opinions on Reparations Issues</p>
<p>Lausanne Conference Takes an Unexpected Turn</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 22nd - It was learned today that German Chancellor von Papen, in talks with the leaders of major powers, attempted to propose a treaty among European nations, including Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, which would in effect dominate Europe. It was also heard that German Foreign Minister Neurath submitted a memorandum to British Prime Minister MacDonald, also proposing that Britain, France, Germany, and Italy conclude an agreement stipulating that they would consult each other before taking any major political actions.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 22nd - Today, Herriot personally visited British Prime Minister MacDonald, submitting a plan from French Finance Minister Germain Martin to suspend war debts for two to five years, and to consider reducing payments at the end of that period based on financial capacity at the time. He also stated that France is willing to fully cooperate with any proposed plans to improve European tariffs in order to achieve success.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 23rd - This morning, MacDonald and Herriot held significant talks in an attempt to find a common ground. It is widely believed that the conference is taking an unexpected turn, and everyone is eagerly awaiting the results of the talks.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 22nd - British Foreign Secretary Simon has departed for London to report to the British cabinet on the latest developments in both the Lausanne reparations conference and the Geneva disarmament conference. He is expected to return to Lausanne around Saturday or Sunday. French Prime Minister Herriot met with British Prime Minister MacDonald today, and MacDonald presented him with a memorandum outlining Britain's position on reparations. According to Britain, Germany is currently unable to pay reparations, and if it is required to do so in the future, it must be given sufficient time to allow Germany's vitality to recover. This memorandum simply states the principles based on Britain's views, and declares that this approach must</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>not be detrimental to Germany's recovery and must be a final solution.</p>
<p>Havas, Lausanne, 23rd - According to news from Germany, Britain's views on reparations have been drafted into a memorandum with four key elements: (1) The solution reached at the Lausanne Conference should be definitive in nature; (2) Germany's payment of reparations should not disrupt economic relations; (3) Germany's payment should not hinder its economic and financial recovery; (4) Even if Germany's ability to pay recovers in the future, it should not be obligated to pay reparations again. Whether this obligation should be reimposed on Germany should only be considered if the creditor nations themselves experience financial difficulties, and regardless of the amount, it should only be enforced when Germany has a trade surplus and a balanced budget.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 22nd - Today, French Prime Minister Herriot and Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss met for about an hour. It is said that the talks were very harmonious, and Herriot finally assured that France would reconsider its policy on bailing out Austrian finances. Therefore, there is renewed hope that France may change its negative attitude.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd - Today, the Foreign Policy Association released a special report on Japan and the "Manchukuo," predicting that Japan will create a fascist military dictatorship. The report stated that for the benefit of the lower and middle classes and farmers, Japan will organize a military dictatorship, one of whose objectives is to consolidate Japan's control over Manchuria.</p>

<p>British Foreign Office Declares It Will Intervene</p>
<p>Havas, London, 22nd - Regarding the Manchurian puppet state's takeover of the Dalian Customs, the Foreign Office declared that it has not received any news. If this is true, then Britain will certainly intervene immediately. Someone in the House of Commons questioned this matter, and the Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, Eden, replied that the Foreign Office has not received reports sufficient to confirm this news.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - All sectors view the "Manchurian puppet state's" seizure of Dalian Customs revenue as a direct violation of the Sino-Japanese agreement on the disposition of this revenue. The Manchester Guardian published an editorial today stating that Japan's denial of responsibility for the Manchurian government's policies has led to a declaration that there is no Manchurian government besides Japan. It is feared that the seizure of the Customs will also make the British government realize the true significance of Japanese activities in Manchuria. Japan's clear intention is to annex the Eastern Provinces, and its establishment of an "independent" state is merely a trick to facilitate achieving that goal. The Open Door policy will soon be denied in the same way. This action is in direct conflict with Japan's international obligations and will shift the blame to the Manchurian government, which has from the outset been undermining international obligations.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Danzig, 22nd - A German cruiser squadron will cruise to the Free City tomorrow, which has caused diplomatic friction, proving that the relationship between Poland and the Free City remains very tense. The German government, in accordance with international custom, had notified Poland in advance that a German fleet would briefly cruise to Danzig, requesting that it be conveyed to the Free City authorities. This was originally Poland's treaty obligation, but the Polish government only notified the Free City government today, stating that there are currently various important reasons why the German fleet's cruise to the Free City is not timely, so it has ordered the Polish representative stationed in Palimbe to notify the German government, declaring that it has ordered the Polish representative stationed in Danzig not to participate in any ceremonies welcoming the German fleet.</p>
<p>Havas, Warsaw, 23rd - The German battleship "Schlesien" arrived in Danzig Bay last night, and two more destroyers arrived this morning. All three ships are anchored one kilometer outside the entrance to the Danzig port. All public buildings in the Danzig port and city, as well as German ships docked at the piers, are flying flags. The German ships entered the port at 5:00 PM. The Stahlhelm is planning a parade in the city tonight.</p>

<p>Electric Communication, Tokyo, 23rd - The Democratic Party is in a state of division due to the Adachi's reinstatement issue. According to observations by the Seiyukai, the division of the Democratic Party is due to emotional rifts among the party's leaders.

Moreover, since President Wakatsuki has no hope of forming a cabinet in the future, this wave of defections is occurring.</p>
<p>Electric Communication, Tokyo, 23rd - The New Party Establishment Faction is not only inducing wavering elements within the Democratic Party, but is also extending its hand to the Kuhara and Tokonami factions within the Seiyukai. Although they are currently maintaining a wait-and-see attitude on the surface, it is said that they plan to use the upcoming special session of parliament as the center, support Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō as the party leader, establish close relations with the military, and then seek to seize power. Its trend is extremely noteworthy.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Situation of Wang, Luo, Song, etc. Negotiating in Beiping <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Contacting the League of Nations Investigating Team Multiple Times</p>
<p>Yoshida Declares He Will Not Protect Gu if He Goes to Japan</p>
<p>Wang and Others Will Visit Feng En Route South</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence - Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, and Railway Vice-Minister Zeng Zhongming, etc., recently came to Beiping with Gu Weijun. Their main purpose was to negotiate important diplomatic and financial issues with the northern authorities and to exchange opinions with the League of Nations Investigating Team. The discussions between Wang and others and Zhang Xueliang in recent days have focused on diplomacy. In addition to a thorough discussion of the overall diplomatic strategy, they quickly exchanged all opinions in the shortest possible time because the Investigating Team is about to go to Japan. On the morning before yesterday (19th), they had a long talk of two or three hours with the team in the Foreign Affairs Building, exchanging all opinions. In the evening, after a banquet at the Prince Shuncheng's mansion, Wang, Luo, Song, Gu, and others had another round of talks with Zhang. At around 11:00 PM, Luo, accompanied by Liu Chongjie, went to the British Embassy to secretly talk with Lytton for two hours, only returning at around 1:00 AM yesterday (20th). At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Wang and others and the members of the Investigating Team continued to exchange opinions in the Foreign Affairs Building, dispersing at 12:00 PM. The Investigating Team side, because there were still internal negotiations to be done, held a discussion meeting of the five members in the conference room downstairs in the Foreign Affairs Building after the meeting, dispersing after a secret talk of about an hour. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Wang and others had further consultations with the members of the Investigating Team in the Foreign Affairs Building. Our side has a clear diplomatic strategy and a clear goal and position on the Northeast issue. The points of discussion with the Investigating Team in recent days have been to clarify and express the truth of the facts and the future solutions. In the discussions at the Foreign Affairs Building on the morning before yesterday, the Investigating Team side seemed to be influenced by Japan's preconceived notions and spoke in favor of Japan on many issues. They also mentioned secondary issues such as the boycott of Japanese goods and the volunteer armies, seeming to have criticisms of our people's spontaneous patriotic behavior, and even touched on internal affairs. The Japanese army's forceful occupation of the Northeast and fabrication of the Manchukuo are established facts, and the whole world knows about them. Right and wrong are already clear without investigation. Abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the trivial, failing to see the big picture, it is unknown where the Investigating Team's understanding lies. The results of Wang and others' two consultations with the Investigating Team yesterday were slightly more advanced than the previous day. Gu Weijun's trip to Japan was also an important issue discussed with the Investigating Team in recent days. The Japanese side strongly opposed Gu's accompanying the Investigating Team to Japan. The Japanese representative Yoshida formally declared to the Investigating Team the day before yesterday that if Gu goes to Japan, the Japanese government will not be responsible for his life and safety. At 5:00 PM that afternoon, Yoshida went to Tang Erhe's residence again and met with Luo Wengan, formally expressing something. The Investigating Team seems to lack the courage to uphold justice. It is now doubtful whether Gu will be able to go to Japan, and judging from the general trend, it is likely that he will not be able to go with them. When the Japanese representative accompanies the Investigating Team to our country, not only do we not express any rejection, but we are also meticulous in terms of hospitality and protection. However, when Gu goes to the Northeast, the Japanese side instigates the puppet state to obstruct him in many ways, and this time it openly comes forward to refuse him going to Japan. The Japanese side's behavior is already outside the norm, and the Investigating Team's failure to uphold justice is even more unreasonable. It is heard that Wang and others believe that if Gu cannot accompany the Investigating Team to Japan, they will issue a statement declaring the process. As for Gu Weijun himself, he follows the orders of the Central Government and has expressed to others that if the Central Government orders me to accompany the Investigating Team to Japan, I will go even if it means sacrificing my life. As for the Investigating Team's departure date for Japan, it was originally scheduled for today (21st), but because various matters have not been negotiated, it is necessary to postpone it, but it cannot be extended too much.</p>
<p>Wang, Luo, Song, etc., have met with Zhang Xueliang about five or six times. On the nights of the 19th and 20th, they had talks of two or three hours, deciding on diplomatic, financial, and military issues one by one. Wang and others, believing that their mission has been completed, have decided to leave Beiping and return to Nanjing on a special train after 6:00 PM tonight (21st). Railway Vice-Minister Zeng Zhongming has telegraphed the railway bureau to prepare a special train. At 11:00 AM on the 20th, a decorated car hanging on the Jinpu Railway was attached to the Pingpu train in Beiping, with 15 guards from the Executive Yuan. The Beining Railway Bureau also provided a first-class dining car, two sleeper cars, and a guard car. It will depart at 6:00 PM tonight and arrive in Taishan at 8:00 AM on the 22nd. Wang, Song, Luo, etc., plan to climb Mount Tai and view the scenery. Wang will also visit Feng Yuxiang at the Puzhao Temple. It is planned to leave Taishan and head south at around 6:00 PM that evening, and is expected to arrive in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 23rd. The Beiping Pacification Headquarters telegraphed Shandong on the 20th, reporting Wang's itinerary. (21st)</p>

<p>Responsibility Lies in Protecting Japanese Nationals Who Move There</p>
<p>It is Scheduled That This Corps Must Be Filled With Two Thousand Members This Year</p>
<p>Is Its Ambition Like This? Are the People of the Country Aware?</p>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo says that in March of this year, the Japanese organized the East Manchuria Colonization Association, with Lieutenant General Inoue Ichiji as chairman, Man Chinyin and Iida Entarō as vice-chairmen, and Reserve Major Hondō Eikichi and Endō Shōjirō as chief officers. On the 10th of this month, they held an opening ceremony in Fujimichō, Kōjimachi Ward, deciding on the departure date for the Immigrant Volunteer Corps and implementing a self-governance system after arming the immigrants, first preparing a large number of police officers to depart at the same time. The members of this corps are entirely reservists from the 31st Infantry Regiment of Hirosaki, numbering approximately 700, with Hondō Eikichi as the corps commander. This corps is organized according to the volunteer army system, taking on the responsibility of maintaining local security, and will permanently reside in Manchuria in the future, no longer returning to their country. At the same time, their nationality will also be changed to Manchurian. It is scheduled to depart from Tokyo on July 20th. The most special thing about the organization of this corps is that it purely adopts the baojia system. In addition to each person carrying a rifle and 50 rounds of ammunition, they are also equipped with six light machine guns, five special cannons, and two light aircraft. After the first batch departs, they will continue to recruit a second and third corps, with a target of 2,000 members moving to Manchuria this year.</p>

<p>And Claim That an American Pastor Transmitted Messages for Ma Zhanshan</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun says that New York Times reporter Steele and German Welt am Sonntag reporter Lindt, bearing the mission of the investigation team, secretly met with Ma Zhanshan and, entrusted by Ma Zhanshan, carried documents and intelligence, which were delivered by American pastor Leonard to Zhifu. The Japanese military headquarters, upon hearing this news, considered the case serious. In addition to instructing Manchukuo to lodge a protest with the American Consul General, they also accused him of concealing Steele and refusing extradition. It also said that the German Berliner Morgenpost was suddenly shocked to hear that reporter Lindt had been arrested by the Japanese army. At the same time, the Berliner Welt am Sonntag published Lindt's meeting and conversation with Ma Zhanshan, stating: "I and Steele, after experiencing all kinds of hardships, were able to meet with Ma Zhanshan. Ma's subordinates have 16,000 cavalry, 14,000 infantry, and 36 artillery pieces, but their aircraft operation is not very skilled. Ma's strategy is to avoid large-scale warfare, only using small units for contact.

<p>A Glimpse of the Fierce Battle Between Land and Sea Forces at Tangjiawan</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Chen Ce's fleet, after the uproar over Chen Jitang's incorporation, part of it sailed far to Hainan, and part anchored at Tangjiawan in Zhongshan Port. There were about ten ships in Tangjiawan, all shallow-water river vessels. Therefore, since the opposition to the incorporation, these ten or so ships have been cruising around Tangjiawan in Zhongshan Port. Recently, Chen Jitang ordered the use of force to resolve the non-compliant fleet. In addition to transferring the Guard Brigade and the Three Independent Regiments to concentrate in Leizhou, preparing to cross the sea to attack Hainan, he also considered the shallow-water ships in Tangjiawan as a thorn in his side. Therefore, the first step was to find a way to eliminate the fleet there, and then use troops against Hainan. In advance, he secretly ordered Liang Gongfu's unit of the Second Regiment of the Training Division to arrive in Shiqi, Zhongshan on the 11th and 12th. From Shiqi, they took the Qiguan bus to Qian Shan, Xiangzhou, Beishan, Baishi, Songlin and other strategic locations to garrison. On the evening of the 13th, they advanced from Qian Shan to Wanzai, opposite Macau. At the same time, heavy troops were deployed in Qian Shan, Beishan, and other places, digging trenches, deploying artillery positions, and erecting many seven-and-a-half-inch retreat tube cannons, controlling the sea surface of Tangjiawan in a triangle, preparing to encircle Chen Ce's fleet from three sides when it arrived, hoping to capture all the ships there. He also consulted with the Macau government in advance, stating that if a battle occurred and the fleet tried to flee to the waters near Macau, it should not be sheltered or protected, otherwise, the Guangdong army would not bear any responsibility. Once the deployment was complete, on the evening of the 16th, the Feipeng, a small ship belonging to Chen Ce, sailed to the sea off Qian Shan. On the morning of the 17th, the Hushang, Pingxi, and Haikang ships arrived successively, anchoring in Tangwan. At this time, Liang's troops stationed in the three key locations in Tangwan used signal flags to order the four ships to disarm and return to the team. The four ships ignored the order. Liang Gongfu then ordered the troops in Qian Shan, Beishan, and Wanzai to launch a fierce attack on the four ships. The Pingxi and Hushang ships also returned fire in defense. They fought fiercely for an hour, and the sound of gunfire was like a continuous string of firecrackers. Later, the ships, without reinforcements, retreated while fighting, heading out to sea towards Macau. Liang opened fire with guns and cannons from Wanzai in Macau, and stray bullets flew everywhere. The Macau government sent Detective Chief Shi to cross the sea to negotiate with Liang's troops, requesting a cease-fire. Liang's troops stated that they had consulted with the Macau government in advance, prohibiting them from accommodating fleeing ships, and that if they did not stop them now, they would naturally not be responsible. Shi's negotiation was ineffective, so he returned and negotiated with Pan Guoliu, the commander of the four ships, requesting that he lead the four ships away from Macau to avoid implicating the people of Macau. Pan, with no base in Macau, ordered the ships to set sail from Macau, steaming towards Jilong Bay. As for the Marine Corps stationed in Zhongshan, to avoid conflict, they had already moved to Dasen Mountain in Baicao, Sanzao in the county. (Evening of June 18)</p>

<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The First Army Group under Chen Jitang's command has been suppressing bandits on the border of Jiangxi and Fujian for several months. Its troop deployment includes the Third Army's Li Yangjing's ten regiments, the Independent First Division's Huang Renhuan's six regiments, and the Independent Second Division's Zhang Ruigui's six regiments on the eastern Jiangxi-Fujian border.

Recently, due to the tense situation, the various units on the Jiangxi-Fujian border have been successively withdrawn to take a defensive position. As the 19th Route Army gradually arrived in Fujian, Chen Jitang ordered the Third Army's various independent regiments, such as the First Independent Regiment's Zhao Lan's unit, the Second Independent Regiment's Xie Zheng's unit, the Third Independent Regiment's Deng Hui's unit, and the Fourth Independent Regiment's Luo Guichun's unit, to be successively transferred back to Dapu and Chaoan to garrison.

<p>bureau plans to transfer the Second Independent Brigade, Chen Zhang's unit, to Jiangxi to take over the defense, but recently, the First Army Group headquarters received a telegram from Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army at the front, stating that the First Army planned to move back to Guangdong due to military affairs. The telegram briefly stated that Peng Dehuai's bandit forces were now based in the Yingqian, Sisun, and Shangbu areas, strengthening their defenses and using dangerous terrain to resist our army, hoping to leave Lianhua and flee to Youxian in western Hunan. Chen Cheng's army was temporarily withdrawn to Zuo'an and Qiaotou due to supply issues. The Hunan army also moved to Shatian and Sidu to consolidate the Hunan border. The subordinate army (i.e., the First Army) will also temporarily move back for further deployment. Considering this, the remaining troops of the First Army may follow Fan's brigade back to Guangdong. The bandit suppression military affairs are becoming increasingly tense. There are also reports that Guangxi province is planning to send troops to assist in the suppression. It has recently been designated that Liao Lei's Seventh Army and Wang Zanbin and Zhou Zuhuang's two divisions of the Fifteenth Army are preparing to depart. It was found that Liao Lei's unit had already departed from Liuzhou to Quanzhou on the 13th. Zhou and Wang's units will depart one after another after Li Zongren's inspection and replenishment. Guangxi province has recently received 200,000 yuan in subsidies from the central government for May, so it is eager to depart. It is said that their route of departure is to take Quanzhou, detour through Yongzhou in southern Hunan, pass through Pingshi on the Guangdong border, and plan to set up a command post in Pingshi to command the Guangxi army to enter southern Jiangxi.

<h3 id="e91">Administrative Reform in Five Provinces Amidst Bandit Suppression <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Specifying Standards for the Appointment of County Magistrates</p>
<p>Effectively Organizing Bandit Suppression Teams</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Lushan Conference decided on a policy of political and military progress in bandit suppression. It is believed that if military and political affairs cannot be coordinated, the follow-up matters after the recapture of bandit areas will be slow, and they will eventually fall back into the hands of bandits. Therefore, to completely eliminate the Red bandits, a thorough reform of politics is necessary. I recently met with Zhu Huaibing, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs. According to him, at this Lushan Conference, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in view of the past bandit suppression in the five provinces of Central China, held separately, and the schemes and regulations implemented were also different. Now, it is necessary to plan uniformly to facilitate progress and to use political forces to assist military progress. For the recovery of bandit areas, special emphasis is placed on political construction. The current bandit suppression and village cleansing regulations in the five provinces are consulted with each other, taking their strengths and discarding their weaknesses. Among them, more laws are taken from Hunan Province. It is also heard that Zhu stated that the Lushan Conference decided on three major cases belonging to the administrative scope, which were shown to a certain party: (1) The standards for the appointment of county magistrates in bandit areas are determined to be those who are 30 years old or older and have the following qualifications: 1. Those who have served as recommended officials for more than two years and have rich military knowledge and experience; 2. Those who have made definite contributions to bandit suppression and communist eradication and have achieved results in handling administrative affairs, as certified by their direct superiors; (2) The methods for rewarding and punishing administrative personnel at all levels in bandit areas shall be handled in accordance with the regulations on rewarding and punishing administrative personnel at all levels during the bandit suppression period. However, in the following circumstances, they may be punished in accordance with military law: 1. Those who flee upon hearing the alarm or leave their posts without permission, resulting in the loss of cities; 2. Those who allow bandit forces to enter without taking measures to prevent them, resulting in devastation in the area; 3. Those who accept bribes to release bandits or negligently release well-known bandit leaders; (3) The organization of local self-defense teams in each county shall be completed within a time limit. The outline of the implementation methods for each county to form security corps or security brigades is as follows (including seven provinces such as Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong): 1. The existing security regiments and standing teams in each county shall be temporarily compiled into security corps or security brigades during the cleansing period after the Department of Civil Affairs or the Security Office investigates the situation and considers it appropriate; 2. The security corps or security brigades in each county shall be divided into two types, A and B. Their organizational structure is as stipulated below. A type security corps shall have jurisdiction over nine or more squadrons, and a B type security corps shall have jurisdiction over six or more squadrons up to less than nine squadrons. A type security brigade shall have jurisdiction over four or more squadrons up to less than six squadrons, and a B type security brigade shall have jurisdiction over two or more squadrons up to less than four squadrons. In addition, Commander-in-Chief Chiang also believed that the team handling in Hunan Province was very good. On the 22nd, he sent a telegram from Lushan to the governments and bandit suppression commanders in the provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan, ordering them to uniformly follow the Hunan Province method in areas where the bandit atmosphere is more intense, and to organize communist eradication volunteer forces within a time limit to increase the people's self-defense forces.

<p>The Fixed Amount is 2.2 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Zhou Junyan, Director of the Department of Finance, and Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Department of Construction, believe that the silk industry in Zhejiang Province has been declining in recent years, resulting in abnormal withering of agriculture, industry, and commerce. This year, affected by the Shanghai War, the silk industry is in an even more precarious situation. They convened leaders from the silk, silk fabrics, banking, and other industries in the province to discuss relief measures, but their ability was limited and the effect was minimal. Now, with the consent of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, they plan to jointly issue a type of Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Bond in the names of the two provinces, with a fixed amount of 2.2 million yuan and a monthly interest rate of 5%, with principal and interest to be repaid in 50 months. The funds for paying principal and interest will be allocated monthly by the Ministry of Finance from the funds under the reduction and exemption agreement between the National Goods Bank in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces. The following are excerpts from the regulations of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Bond:</p>

<p>Teachers in Various Schools Go on Strike to Demand Back Pay</p>
<p>Lanzhou Dispatch: Gansu Province's financial income cannot make ends meet, and the difficulties have reached the extreme. Before Shao Lizi took office, the province's income for this year had been almost entirely used up, and the education expenses were in arrears for more than 20 months. Since Shao took office, he has tried his best to raise funds. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, each agency was paid one month's expenses, but the teachers and staff of the schools demanded back pay, requesting to be paid three months' arrears. However, the provincial treasury was empty, and the authorities had no ability to turn lead into gold, and did not agree to their request, which led to a strike. Shao stated that he has always attached great importance to education, but the arrears did not start with him. This time, one month's expenses were paid to all agencies, which had already exhausted his efforts, and how could he take care of the old debts? He earnestly persuaded the schools, and it is said that the teachers and staff of the schools have been able to understand the authorities' difficulties, and there is talk of resuming classes immediately.</p>

Initially, Zhang Lianquan, the chief of Nanwai Town, according to a letter from Gu Yingfu, said that Yao Runmin invaded the construction circle and the underground drainage ditch, which was considered to hinder public interest and traffic. He transferred to our office to investigate and stop him from coming. When the prevention of obstructing public interest and blocking traffic concerns the public interest, our district chief serves the village and intends to use personal emotions to find ways to dredge the solution, so that both sides can be balanced. He went to the town with the town chief to investigate and survey, but he did not meet Gu Yingfu because he was out. Later, according to Yao Runmin, the case of building an underground drainage ditch was concluded after three trials by the judiciary, and there was absolutely no obstacle to public interest and traffic. The construction circle is even more non-existent, etc. After investigation by our district chief, it was found that there was no error, and the construction of the drainage ditch had already undergone legal trial, and the procedures were complete, and there was nothing to criticize. The interview draft is very different from the facts. We are sincerely afraid of turning errors and transmitting errors, so we wrote a letter to explain in detail, hoping that you will give the column to publish the letter to show the truth. To the highest degree of public friendship, District Chief Zhong Taishi, June 22.</p>

<h3 id="e105">To Those Advocating for Resuming Diplomatic Relations with Russia - Chen Qitian <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>And Questioning Shen Bao Reporter Mr. Chen Binhe (Part 3, Continued)</p>
<p>This line of argument seems to have transformed from the "resume relations" theory into a "communist" theory. I want to ask Mr. Chen for a clear answer: Are you merely advocating for resuming relations, or are you also advocating for communism? If you advocate for both resuming relations and communism, then I will debate the issue of communism with you. However, if you only advocate for resuming relations and oppose communism, then you should not use such ambiguous language and merely present one-sided arguments to confuse the ignorant. It is said that Shen Bao has a circulation of 130,000 copies, with at least 200,000 readers. It seems that a reporter for such a major newspaper should be particularly careful about the arguments and wording used in current affairs commentaries, and should be responsible for every statement made. Mr. Chen, you are a rising star reporter. I hope you cherish your future, do more to benefit the nation, and avoid future regrets. This is my sincere and well-intentioned advice, and I hope Mr. Chen will accept it. How many people supported the Communist Party six years ago? But what was the result? Take Mr. Chen Duxiu, for example. Was he not the most ardent promoter of communism and the longest-serving leader of the Communist Party? However, Russia said he did not support the policy of violent revolution, labeled him an "opportunist" and "liquidationist," and expelled him. Now, the Communists do not recognize him as a Communist Party member, and he is left hiding in the concessions with a few disgruntled comrades, occasionally uttering mournful cries. Russia used him up and then wanted to overthrow him to prevent him from becoming too powerful to control. I truly feel sorry for him, as he was merely a sacrifice for Russia. I also regret that he misled so many enthusiastic young people. My friend Mr. Yun Daiying had a 14-year friendship with me (from the first year to the fourteenth year of the Republic). I know he was capable and competent, truly a top-notch figure in the Communist Party. Last year, he came to Shanghai from Hubei to mediate internal conflicts within the Communist Party, but he was betrayed and killed by his comrades. Before his death, he told someone, "It is better that I die. The so-called communism of today is tens of thousands of miles away from my original ideals. The darkness and infighting within the Party are truly unbearable to witness and make it difficult for me to do the right thing. It is better to die sooner rather than later." When I heard this news, I deeply regretted his fate. What a talented person, merely sacrificed for Russia.</p>
<p>What I said seems to have strayed from the topic. Now, let's return to discussing with Mr. Chen whether we should immediately resume diplomatic relations with Russia, assuming that "the current state of China is the most suitable soil for communism." Before discussing this issue, we must recognize that there are two major categories of reasons for the rampant activities of Chinese communists: one is internal, arising from within, which is what Mr. Chen calls "soil"; the other is external, coming from Russia, which is Russia using the convenience of resumed diplomatic relations to instigate the activities of the Communist Party. If we want to save China and eliminate the communists, we must address both internal and external factors simultaneously, treating both the root and the symptoms. If we only guard against external factors without addressing internal ones, it would be like placing rotten objects in an iron box, which will eventually breed insects and even decay. If we only address internal factors without guarding against external ones, it would be like placing soil in the open air, allowing people to freely sow poisonous weeds and irrigate and fertilize them, enabling them to rapidly flourish and grow, to the point where touching them would cause widespread harm, making it impossible to save the situation. Therefore, we can revise Mr. Chen's article as follows to express our meaning:</p>
<p>The focus of the question is not only whether our country has soil suitable for communism and whether there are opportunities for communism to spread, but also whether Russia will use this soil and these opportunities to promote communism and aid the communists after resuming diplomatic relations. If, after resuming diplomatic relations, Russia can further use this soil and these opportunities to achieve the goal of communizing China, then immediately resuming diplomatic relations with Russia would only hasten China's demise. What benefit would there be? Ignoring the external factors of the problem and not asking about them at all is like opening the door to welcome thieves and recognizing robbers as one's own children, merely serving as propaganda for the bandits. Alas! Even if things are already rotten, placing them in an iron box may still breed insects. How can we not cherish them and allow poisonous bacteria to invade everywhere, hastening their death?</p>
<p>Now that "our country has no strong unified government," no "strict social organization," no "stable people's livelihood," and no "grasp on controlling communists," wanting to follow in the footsteps of the great powers, opening the door wide, and allowing "conspirators of red terror" to enter and exit freely is tantamount to allowing people to sow communist poisonous seeds on Chinese soil and then supporting and aiding their growth, making the red disaster impossible to contain. If our country wants to be saved, it must, on the one hand, eliminate national traitors and reform politics at its root, and on the other hand, resist foreign powers (including resisting Japan and severing relations with Russia) and eliminate the communists (the communists are Russia's plainclothes troops) to treat its symptoms. If we do not address both the root and the symptoms, and consider both internal and external factors, and want to use immediately resuming diplomatic relations with Russia as a temporary measure, is your vision not too short-sighted? (Note 3) (Note 4)</p>
<p>Note 1: Mr. Chen Binhe's five current affairs commentaries appeared in Shen Bao: (1) May 12, "Resuming Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union and Preventing Communism," (2) May 13, "From the International Situation to Sino-Russian Diplomatic Relations," (3) May 14, "A Third Discussion on Sino-Soviet Diplomatic Relations," (4) May 30, "Clarifying Doubts about Resuming Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union," (5) June 4, "Re-Clarifying Resuming Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Note 2: The original text of Mr. Chen quoted in this article all comes from the above five articles. To save space, it is not specifically noted under each quotation. To clarify the arguments, the quoted sentences all follow the original text without any additions or deletions.</p>
<p>Note 3: The last paragraph is written in classical Chinese, which is inconsistent with the style of this article. Moreover, the use of pronouns to follow Mr. Chen's style is also not entirely satisfactory. However, in order to compare the differences and similarities in viewpoints and to determine right and wrong, it is attempted.</p>
<p>Note 4: The original plan for this article was to have another section to discuss in detail whether the reasons for resuming diplomatic relations mentioned in the previous five current affairs commentaries were sufficient, but after working on it for an entire night (from 7 pm on the 8th to 7 am on the 9th), I could not continue. I will tentatively use this article to have a preliminary discussion with Mr. Chen. When referring to Mr. Chen in the article, it always refers to Mr. Binhe and is not self-referential. (End)</p>

<p>Students Strike...Do Not Show Up For Exams</p>
<p>Qingdao, 22nd Telegram - The Qingdao University Student Self-Government Association submitted four demands to the university administration on the 16th: (1) Abolish dormitory fees, following the precedent of other universities; (2) Revise Article 43 of the academic regulations, which stipulates that students who fail three courses in a year, or two required courses, will be dismissed; (3) Remove unqualified teachers; (4) Open up the library for academic use.

The university administration held an administrative meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd and decided that exams would be held as usual on the 23rd. Further measures would be decided if students did not take the exams.</p>

<h3 id="e109">The Tragic Situation of Educational Destruction in Harbin by the Japanese Army <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>丨All Cultural Institutions Occupied and Objects Transported Away丨</p>
<p>丨News of Investigation Team Arriving in Harbin, Forcing Schools to Reopen丨</p>
<p>丨Switching to Japanese Textbooks Confuses Teachers and Students丨</p>
<p>According to a secret investigation report from a foreign agency to the diplomatic authorities, the situation of the destruction of education in Harbin by the Japanese army after their arrival is very detailed. The report is recorded as follows: After the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, they completely occupied elementary schools, middle schools, universities, and all levels of schools in various places, and destroyed the schools. For example, the buildings of the Second and Third Middle Schools in Harbin were very grand, and the internal equipment was also very complete. When the Japanese army arrived in Harbin, they completely occupied the elementary and middle schools, and all students and staff were expelled. The school buildings were damaged, and all valuable items inside were transported away. The courtyards were filled with soldiers, and sandbags were piled up in front of the gates. The cultural area was turned into a military camp, with armed guards as if facing a formidable enemy, which was very painful to witness. All cultural institutions and libraries in Harbin were occupied, and none were preserved. When the League of Nations investigation team arrived in Liaoning, there was news that they would go to Harbin. To avoid the team's attention, the Japanese temporarily moved the Japanese army out of the schools a few days in advance, and the sandbags in front of the gates were also removed. Teachers and students were notified and forced to reopen the schools. Teachers were urged and forced to go to school by name. Those who were unwilling to go or resigned were arrested and imprisoned. As for the textbooks used, whether in elementary or middle schools, they were not allowed to use the textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education of the National Government. Instead, all Japanese textbooks were used. Teachers and students were forced to go to school and listen to orders perfunctorily. In several elementary schools when classes started, the textbooks issued were all single articles. Students did not understand the meaning of the textbooks. When they asked the teachers, the teachers replied, "I don't understand either, just listen confusedly." The pain of enduring humiliation and seeking survival can be imagined. After class, most of the students ran away. In addition, the Japanese army would come to the schools to inspect from time to time and cause trouble for no reason. If they were dissatisfied, they would take the opportunity to make trouble and arrest people at any time. The 90th Elementary School in Xinzhengyang River was inspected by the Japanese army several times, and teachers were arrested for no reason. Principal Wang was even scolded by the Japanese army to his face, saying that he should pay attention in the future, otherwise, they would handle things in the same way, acting arrogantly and treating Chinese people as worse than subjugated slaves. Principal Li of Harbin Provincial Middle School said that one day the Japanese army went to the school and searched it extensively. When asked why they were searching, the Japanese soldiers said that because stones had fallen in front of them at the back gate of the school late at night while they were on patrol, they were searching and investigating strictly. The principal did not dare to speak. The next day, more than 30 Japanese soldiers came again to search. After the search, they told the principal that if there were any more acts of insulting the Japanese army, they would be shot (referring to the students and the principal). If Sanmin Zhuyi and Party doctrine books were found in the homes of students' families and people in the education sector, the Japanese army would burn the books after searching them and arrest and interrogate the people. The various kinds of unbearable situations are too numerous to mention. The tragic situation of national subjugation is even worse than in Korea and Annam, it is said.</p>

<p>Thirty-Five</p>
<p>The three of us – Mr. Zhu, my younger brother, and I – went for a walk in the countryside. We saw Mrs. Chen washing clothes by the pond. Mr. Zhu pointed to the grass behind her and asked, "What does that mean?" I followed Mr. Zhu's direction and saw a lively little child sitting in a large basket! It turned out that this was Mrs. Chen's little treasure. There was no one at home to help take care of him, and she was afraid he would play in the water by the pond, so his mother had put him in a basket and asked him to sit there. Mrs. Chen would wash a few times and then turn around to look at him. Mr. Zhu asked, "Are there many cases like this?" I said, "One morning, Aunt Sun came to the temple with a small stool in her left hand and her four-year-old daughter in her right hand. She said, 'Bell! I need to pick firewood and sell it in the city. I'm entrusting Qiaogu to your care for half a day. Just have her sit on the stool and don't let her run around.' This kind of thing is common. Most people entrust their children to neighbors and relatives to take care of them." Mr. Zhu played with the little baby in the basket for a while, then walked and thought. Suddenly, he said excitedly, "Bell! We've discovered a new continent today! I see that the little baby in the basket is a burden for Mrs. Chen. Qiaogu is the same burden for Aunt Sun. And there are many more like those who follow their mothers and grandmothers around like tails, making them anxious." I said, "You are right, sir. These children are only three to five years old, they can't herd cattle, they can't cut grass, they can't deliver meals. They are in the way at home, and when they go out, they are a burden. Rural women are indeed overwhelmed. Why are you so happy about this? What new continent have you discovered?"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said, "These children don't have all those difficulties you mentioned. Crying, hugging, whining, peeing, pooping – their bodily functions are not a big problem. If we have a place for these children to play, their mothers can entrust them there and go to work with peace of mind. And if they bring them in the morning and pick them up in the evening, they will feel as if they haven't seen each other for a long time, and the love and happiness between mother and child can be imagined. In the city, places that take care of children like this are called nurseries and kindergartens. Nurseries and kindergartens in the countryside are truly in their element! The countryside is the new continent of nurseries and kindergartens!"</p>

<p>丨Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Attend丨</p>
<p>丨Consul General in San Francisco to Represent丨</p>
<p>Italy Resolves to Adopt Elite Doctrine</p>
<p>United Kingdom and Canada Proceeding Secretly</p>
<p>Finland Confident in Long-Distance Running and Throwing</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd Telegram - The 10th World Games are scheduled to be held from July 30th to August 14th in Los Angeles, California, USA. The Ministry of Education has requested our embassy in the United States to appoint the Consul General in San Francisco to attend on its behalf. The International Technical Education Conference is scheduled to be held in Brussels from September 26th to 28th. The Ministry of Education has requested the Minister to Belgium to send personnel to participate on its behalf.</p>
<p>Italy: The country's preparations for this Olympics have adopted the elite doctrine. The events in which it has been decided to compete are: (1) Athletics (only track events), 6 swimmers, 8 boxers, 8 cyclists, and fencing (undetermined). The above five sports are what the country is traditionally confident in. At the previous Amsterdam Games, boxing, which had 5 victories in 8 events, and fencing, which had 2 victories, should select promising athletes to participate in the Games this time.</p>
<p>United Kingdom: The country's dark horses may be more numerous than those of other countries. The preparations for the events appear calm on the surface, but in reality, they are not to be underestimated. It is said that it has been decided to select 120 skilled athletes for various events.</p>
<p>Finland: The country is most confident in long-distance running and throwing. The leader of long-distance running is expected to secure past glory. In addition to the above two sports, Finland's decathlon and pentathlon athletes have also broken world records, and outstanding newcomers are emerging, so they will not fall behind in this competition.</p>
<p>Canada: At the 1928 Amsterdam Games, Canada's track short-distance running was admired by the world. For this Games, they had already sent inspectors to Los Angeles to conduct on-site investigations and actively prepare. However, the country has always maintained a silent attitude, and the final selections have not been completed. It is vaguely heard that the events they are participating in are the triple jump, long jump, and short-distance running. Other events are still being pre-selected and have not yet been announced.</p>

<p>English female player Miss Standring had an excellent opportunity today to almost eliminate Mrs. Craven-Gough of Germany, who reached the finals last year, in the first round. Unfortunately, she failed. In what would have been her best performance, she won the first set 6-4, and in the second set, she was leading 5-4, and in the tenth game, she was ahead 2-1, when she suddenly collapsed with cramps. Her efforts were in vain, and Craven-Gough won 4-6, 7-5, 6-0.</p>

<p>London, 21st - Wimbledon was greatly shocked today. Tennis King Cochet, the most promising contender for the singles title, was defeated in the second round by English Davis Cup player Collins, with a score of 6-2, 8-6, 0-6, 6-3.</p>
<p>This Scottish strongman, Collins, deserved the victory. Although Collins has never been regarded as a formidable singles player, his serves in today's match were exceptionally magnificent, and the balls he hit constantly prevented Cochet from using his sweeping, baseline stroke, which Cochet uses to dominate the entire court and with which he has gained world renown.</p>

<h3 id="e125">King of Han Wei Nu <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Those who wear clogs avoid mentioning the word "Wo," especially "Wo Nu." If we call them "Wo Nu," they will retort and write "Shina Wo Nu" on the walls.</p>
<p>According to Shuowen Jiezi, the character "Wo" (倭) is a phono-semantic compound, with "ren" (人, person) as the semantic component and "wei" (委) as the phonetic component. The characters "Wo" and "Wei" originally had no different pronunciations and were used interchangeably in ancient times. The seal above, with the five characters "King of Han Wei Nu" (漢委奴國王) in white seal script, is copied from the Japanese book "Kinsekishi." According to the Japanese book "Kogorajiroku," "The seal is made of gold, with a snake as the handle. It is slightly less than eight fen square and five li thick, weighing twenty-nine qian. It was excavated in the fourth year of Tenmei (1784), under a giant rock in the ground of Shiga Island, Naka County, Chikuzen Province." The fourth year of Tenmei corresponds to the nineteenth year of the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty. As for the year the seal was granted, it is recorded in the Book of the Later Han: "In the second year of the Zhongyuan reign of Emperor Guangwu, the Wo Nu Kingdom offered tribute and paid homage, and Emperor Guangwu bestowed upon them a seal and ribbon." It is likely this very gold seal. When the Han people were strong, bestowing upon them the seal of the King of Wei Nu was an immense honor for them. Even now, they still treat it as a treasure, recorded in the accounts of archaeologists, as precious as the celestial sphere, the Yellow River Map, the red sword, and the great instruction!</p>
<p>Alas! The great Han people, now, when we call them "Wo Nu," they retort! They even offer us the four characters "Shina Wo Nu"! If our countrymen do not strive for self-improvement, we will truly become Shina Wo Nu! Compatriots with blood in your veins! Is it painful? Is it not painful? Is it shameful? Is it not shameful?</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Calligraphy of Party and State Leaders <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Chinese calligraphy is different from that of other countries. Seal script, clerical script, regular script, and cursive script each have their own wonders, vigorous, refined, and elegant. Characters are transmitted through people. In addition to accomplishments, character is especially important. This article only discusses the calligraphy of party and state leaders, and not others, as an aid to conversations over tea and wine. In the past, Tan Zuan'an's family collected many of Nanyuan Songchan's works. He would copy them in his spare time, wielding the brush with ease. He liked to write for others, but those without a connection were often done by Yue Sen. Yu Youren liked to wield the brush before bed in the evening, free and unrestrained, creating his own style. His nephew Zhou Bomin's imitation was very similar, almost indistinguishable (eight or nine out of ten of the Yu Youren calligraphy printed by the China Commercial Press were written by Zhou). Zhang Jingjiang (was especially good at landscape painting), Wang Jingwei, and Ye Yuhu were all skilled in calligraphy, but they were quite conceited and did not easily write for others. Hu Hanmin's copying of the Cao Quan Stele was very profound, rigorous, and simple, the characters like the man. In recent years, Dai Jitao devoted himself to practicing calligraphy, liking to write on bird-silk grids, quite neat and elegant. Wu Zhihui's seal script and Xu Shiying's running script each reached their own perfection. Zhang Xueliang used to practice seal script diligently in the Northeast, still without vulgarity. As for Li Liejun, he lacked dominance, and Chu Minyi tended towards vulgarity (only responding to every request, the opposite of his brother-in-law Jingwei). Shao Yuancong was too artificial, Wang Boqun's fiery temperament had not dissipated. Cai Yuanpei, Yang Shukan, Ma Junwu, Zou Lu, and Yi Peiji each formed their own style, recognizable at a glance. Niu Yongjian was originally a military man, his characters without dominance, but he did not write easily. Xu Qian was extremely confident in his calligraphy, having written nineteen methods of using the brush, saying what others had not said. Those who study calligraphy may wish to read it. Lin Zichao, Tang Shaochuan, Sun Zhesheng, Kong Xiangxi, and others all had their trusted aides write on their behalf, such as Yi Dachang on behalf of Tang and Liang Hancao on behalf of Sun. Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Feng Yuxiang, Zhang Zhijiang, Hu Zongduo, Ma Fuxiang, Liu Wendao, etc., also wrote from time to time. Due to their rank and learning, their military character was revealed in their ink. Others such as Jing Ziyuan's 　Baozi, Liu San's Shimen Ode, Lin Zhixian's Han stele, Xie Wuliang and Liu Yazi's running script, Ru Yuli and Zhou Bonian's Wei stele, Wang Luyi and Ma Yichu's small regular script, each had their own strengths and were all worth seeing. They can be transmitted not because they are in the party and state.</p>

<p>Regarding the Peace Army: A British weekly said that recently, in view of the intensity of the Sino-Japanese war in the Far East, which is not a blessing for world peace, someone proposed organizing a large peace army to interpose between the two armies to stop the fighting. This was originally a good idea, and there was a precedent in history. After the Roman Empire embraced Christianity, the bloody gladiatorial contests were still a popular pastime for most people. One day, during a gladiatorial contest, a Christian monk named Telemachus jumped into the arena and threw himself between the two gladiators to stop the bloodshed. Unfortunately, the monk's good intentions were in vain, and he was killed by the two men. However, this tragic impression was deeply imprinted in the minds of the people, and the gladiatorial contests were later abolished. However, this kind of story cannot be applied to modern times. Therefore, whether the Peace Army will be effective is still a question. The most reliable messengers of peace should still be the international bankers, who refuse all loans for military equipment.</p>

<p>— Gongyu</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, Saltzawa, the Japanese naval commander stationed in Shanghai, was emboldened by the Mukden Incident, believing that the Chinese army would not dare to resist, and even if they did, they would not last long and could be resolved in four hours. Therefore, he rashly launched an attack. Unexpectedly, the resistance of the 19th Route Army was so fierce that the Japanese naval landing force, combined with 6,000 local Japanese, was routed. If it were not for the concessions as a shield, the entire army would have been annihilated. The Japanese government then ordered Nomura to lead reinforcements to Shanghai. At that time, the Japanese were still extraordinarily confident, as if Nomura's arrival would immediately resolve the 19th Route Army. When other countries offered to mediate, they said that Lieutenant General Nomura was a peaceful politician and would not allow the situation to escalate. Nomura also said to foreign reporters, "In another seven days, our work in Shanghai will be finished." Such was his arrogance. However, after several attacks, they were still defeated. The Japanese government was shocked and realized that our army could not be taken lightly. They urgently ordered the elite 9th Division to go to aid, appointing Division Commander Ueda Kenkichi as commander. Ueda was quite confident. When he left, his spirits were particularly high, making all kinds of boasts to those who saw him off, firmly believing that as soon as he arrived in Shanghai, he could drive our army out of the Shanghai area. Who would have thought that after a half-month of fierce fighting, he would still be defeated and unable to gain an inch? It was not until he was replaced by Shirakawa Yoshinori, with an even larger number of troops, that they saw our thin defenses at Liuhe. They secretly dispatched a large army to land and attack our army's rear, forcing our army to retreat completely to the second line of defense overnight, without leaving a single soldier or a single weapon. Westerners praised this as a miracle. However, when it came to rewarding merit, it was attributed to Shirakawa. Therefore, when Shirakawa was dying, the Japanese Emperor bestowed upon him the title of Baron, while Ueda was not included. Now Ueda has returned to Japan. A friend wrote to me, saying that he is quite ashamed to see the friends and relatives who saw him off in the past. When someone mentions the Shanghai battle, he shakes his head and says nothing. So, from now on, will the Japanese dare to be arrogant again and treat us as if we are nothing?</p>
<h3 id="e129">Discussion on Researching Chinese Medicine <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Jiliang</p>
<p>When I was studying medicine in Chiba, Japan, I heard a lecture by a German pharmacologist who mentioned our country in one section, roughly saying that due to geographical reasons, China's medicinal products are mostly plants. Although they have not undergone scientific procedures, their efficacy is often not weaker than the mineral drugs in Europe and America that are purely chemically synthesized. From this, we can see the value of natural resources. If we add artificial research, what will the results be? Unfortunately, in China's five thousand years, there has only been Shennong. If I were given ten years, I would travel all over China, and I know that the secrets I would uncover would be quite impressive, and so on. His words were exaggerated and full of criticism, deeply causing me and my peers shame and resentment. But the fact is so. At that time, it was truly difficult to find one person in our country who was capable of inventing new drugs. Until recently, the people of our country have gradually been able to demonstrate their abilities. In Shanghai alone, there are already many new drugs that have been created and introduced to the world. However, those who fail are often numerous. Are these people all deceiving the world with fake drugs? According to my research, there are quite a few that are far superior to imported products, but ultimately difficult to succeed. This is because the founders are ignorant of righteousness and profit, fond of greatness and success, and in the way of research, do not know what is called striving for perfection. Their failure is appropriate. The owner of Shanghai Peisheng Pharmaceutical Company is committed to the Lung-Benefiting and Gold-Nourishing Herb. We have long known that it was invented several generations ago and collected from thousands of miles away. He spares no major sacrifices to seek a radical cure for those with lung diseases. This is deeply in line with the indomitable spirit of European and American creators. Therefore, I was always concerned about the words of a certain pharmacologist in the past. Now I am relieved and have no regrets.</p>
<p>Short News: The Zhongcheng Art Society at No. 672 Old Rougemont Road recently invented a kind of silhouette painting. It is matched with an artistic frame and is very unique. Placed in the room, it adds a lot of color. It is also quite suitable as a gift. It is said that the Meimei Company at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Mohawk Road and the Chunji Tang in the Penglai Market all sell it.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Battalion Commander Li's Wearing of Flowers <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Yanmeng</p>
<p>A week ago, I, through the introduction of a friend, went specifically to Longhua Hospital to visit a wounded battalion commander who is still in bed. A fair face, a short and stocky figure, handsome eyebrows, such a brave shadow flashed into my eyes. When I stepped into the room of that loyal battalion commander, his eyes were tightly closed, flying flesh and blood, broken bodies, the symphony of gunfire, I imagined, people's broken "Shanghai War" impressions, forever lingering in his soul, gnawing at his loyal heart. "Battalion Commander Li!" My friend gently called him, he opened his hazy eyes, it seemed that he was very laborious, but his eyes were still bleary.</p>
<p>"Oh? Who? You, Lao Mai!" He stared for a while before shouting it out. He approached us, shook hands with me humbly, smiled, and asked my name. He enthusiastically poured water and asked us to sit down. After talking for a while, we became very familiar friends. "How long have you been injured?" I asked him with concern.</p>
<p>"Ah, on the deep night of February 4th, I wore flowers, very ashamed, very early." He replied calmly. "Where did you wear flowers?"</p>
<p>"Fashionable ladies wear them by their temples, young masters wear them on the hard chests of their formal attire. We, of course, wear them on our skin. I was injured in the thigh." He coughed, and then said, "Originally, I didn't need to stay in the hospital, but I was injured by a dumdum bullet, you see, my eyes are still like a blind man!" He seemed a little emotional.</p>
<p>"Sacrificing for the country, injured for the nation, the flowers you wear, Battalion Commander, are unfading flowers of glory, and you should have no regrets." I comforted him, with my most sublime sympathy.</p>
<p>"I joined the army at the age of fourteen, and I came from the ranks. I have fought for fifteen years, and only this time did my consciousness think it had meaning. I oppose both civil wars and international wars, but eliminating the strong is the truth, the most satisfying justice - that cannot be said to be 'national feeling.' I wear flowers, and this one is truly the most fragrant, the most beautiful in color!"</p>
<p>"Victory is originally not a condition of war." Battalion Commander Li seemed to have a profound feeling, he continued, "This cannot be considered a purely struggle. It's just that Japanese soldiers came to hit us, and we bit the bullet and fought them. Our rifles, after firing four or five times, would get hot. What are we fighting with? Their planes scout while assisting the army in combat, and also drop non-dispersing fireworks to mark targets for the artillery." He began to shake his head, smiling bitterly and tragically. He stopped his mouth by the county river.</p>
<p>At that time, loneliness occupied our space, and I was afraid that he would become sentimental, so I quickly asked, "Then why were we able to resist for more than a month, and maintain the advantage?"</p>
<p>"Advantage?" His voice was a little dry, "Exchanged for with blood and flesh. At the beginning of the engagement, they deployed two men for every one of our brothers. Later, it was one for one, and finally, under their fierce artillery fire, it became two of them for every one of us. For a month, we used our blood to maintain the Chinese personality! Alas, the poor brothers, in the bombardment of heavy artillery and bombs, they were simply listening to their deaths."</p>
<p>Finally, the blood-like red clouds stained the eyes of that respectable hero, and the tears exposed the true nature of humanity. His voice was also hoarse, "We didn't have anti-aircraft guns, and we couldn't borrow them no matter where we borrowed. Later, we were fortunate to get the help of the Fifth Army, who lent us seven. Three protected the Zhenru radio station, and the regimental commanders on the front line didn't even have one to protect them. In the gentle piano sounds of the ladies, we retreated completely."</p>
<p>Finally, Battalion Commander Li also talked to me a lot about politics, concluding with one sentence: everyone is fighting over bones. He solemnly indicated to me that he denied his war achievements, he wanted to find his new life. I felt that Battalion Commander Li was a promising soldier in China. The credit belongs to others, the fault is mine, that kind of spirit is great!</p>

<p>Chapter Eleven: Gazing at the Governor's Pennant in a Lopsided Small Town, Grotesque Crowds of People Follow the Outriders</p>
<p>Otherwise. This city has no real output of local products that would benefit actual commerce. The finances were also originally impoverished. If it weren't for those passing merchants with their large consumption and purchasing power, where would you find so many good customers? But where do these merchants come from? Why do they gather here? It's still a question. This then boils down to the means by which the county magistrate becomes a lucrative and wealthy position. It turns out that these merchants are all here specifically to file lawsuits! The local customs are fierce and strong. In addition to being fully expressed in the wind-swept fishing boats and the dens of bandits gathered in the mountains, they are also extremely litigious and quick to take offense. On weekdays, they make a profit by fishing and selling salt in the sea, and by robbing homes and benefiting themselves at the expense of their neighbors. They accumulate some money and return to their hometown to buy fields and houses, still acting as law-abiding citizens. However, their heroic spirit remains, and they are privately competitive. It is difficult for them to live in peace with their neighbors. Often, for the smallest of things, such as a chicken or a wall, a disagreement will lead to a strong-willed outburst, and they are determined to gain the upper hand. But at this time, they do not use the white knives in, red knives out kind of trick to determine who is superior. They must join hands and go to the county seat and county government to file lawsuits, seeking the county magistrate to judge right and wrong, taking winning the lawsuit as the supreme glory and face. The county government in this kind of remote county also manages the judiciary, which is equivalent to running a side business with great prospects. Having good customers who file lawsuits and are willing to come to the door in an endless stream is extremely welcome. No wonder the officials have many benefits, and the resources of this street depend entirely on these people who file lawsuits to add color, and attract many lawyers and yamen runners to talk about their litigation strategies day and night, in order to obtain money through various entertaining activities such as eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. One day, at dusk, a group of newly arrived wealthy merchants suddenly arrived at the Changxing Inn, the most famous and wealthiest inn in the county government. They were not the village elders who had come from the surrounding villages to file lawsuits, but officials from the provincial capital who had been dispatched with other public duties. The group consisted of more than ten people in total. They hired two official-style blue cloth curtained mule carts and several tall animals, guarded by four or five armed soldiers in military uniforms with box guns around their waists, walking in front of and behind the carts. They came in a mighty and imposing manner, showing off their power along the way.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Financial News: Gold Prices Trend Higher <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Drafts Tight, Shows Excellent Prospects at 5 Liang 8 Qian: Yesterday, the gold price rebounded to a high peak without much fluctuation. Throughout the day, there were transactions of 5 liang, with an overall increase of 6 liang in sight. The price increased immediately upon opening, mainly due to the decline of silver prices in London, stability in the US, and weakness in European markets. Subsequently, the price hovered between 736 and 737 liang. As foreign exchange tightened and then stabilized, the gold price slightly decreased. Later, the market went from weak to strong, mainly because of the sudden surge in drafts. The recent settlement price for British gold was only 1 shilling and 8 pence, and for US gold, $30.0125. The buying interest on the trading floor was intense, and sentiment was very high, with the price almost reaching the 740 liang border. However, swapping July for August was cheaper, at only 3 liang and a half. Various firms still had over 8,900 outstanding swaps, with the total amount for August contracts being approximately 20,000. The daily situation is detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Opened with an Increase of 3 Liang 8 Qian: From the early opening, the August contract immediately increased by 3 liang and 2 qian, reaching 736 liang and 5 qian. Large contracts narrowed from 1/16 to 1/8. Silver prices remained unchanged, mainly because reports from the trading floor indicated significant sales in the US, thus improving the Shanghai market. Shun Lee, Fu Yu, and others were the first to enter the market, followed by 6 liang and 8 qian. However, hedging led to selling, causing the price to drop to 5 liang and 7 qian. Later, Yuan Mao, Yong Fu Yu, Bing Xing, and others bought in, coupled with the August US dollar bank exchange rate of 3.75. Mitsui absorbed half a yuan for September, and Sumitomo sold British gold for August at 1.25, due to purchases from Bombay, so the gold price should increase to 37 liang and 8 qian. Subsequently, there was a fluctuation of 1 liang. Heng Xing sold, while Yuan Mao, Yong Yu, He Yuan Mao, and others bought in. After 9:20 AM, Heng Xing sold again. Fu Xing, Yong Da, De Cheng, Bing Xing, Fu Yu, Yi Cheng, and Yuan Heng were all able to unload. Furthermore, HSBC released US dollars for the current month at 0.25 and August at 0.375, along with British gold for July at 1.875, causing a market setback. At 9:30 AM, the price was 35 liang and 7 qian, with British and US gold each decreasing by 0.125. At this time, Xie Xing, Yong Yuan Tai, Heng Yu, Shun Li, Wan Xing, and others all entered, immediately increasing the price by 2 liang, then to 37 liang and 6 qian. Subsequently, the foreign exchange market seemed to ease, with British gold for September at 1.875 available for settlement. Furthermore, Da Xing Yong, Bing Xing, Yuan Heng, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, and others all had sales, resulting in a decrease of 3 liang. However, between 9:30 AM and 10:30 AM, there was a fluctuation of 1 liang. Finally, at 10:50 AM, the price settled at 34 liang and a half. Later, Yuan Kang, Xiang Hong Kang, Yong Fu, Tai Heng, Zhi Feng Yong, Yong Yi Feng Yong, and others came to buy, and general shorts also took the opportunity to enter, pulling the price up by 1 liang at 11:45 AM to 36 liang and 2 qian. Heng Xing Yi Feng Yong continued to sell, slightly undercutting by several qian, to 5 liang and 7 qian. The price then increased to 6 liang and 1 qian. By the noon closing, the price was 35 liang and 8 qian, then traded around 5 liang, with goods trading at a small 5 qian.</p>
<p>Strong Buying in the Afternoon Market: The afternoon market opened at 35 liang and 1 qian, carrying the momentum from the noon closing, hence the low opening price. Shun Li made slight gains, followed by 5 liang and 9 qian, then retreated to 5 liang and 3 qian. Fu Xing Yong entered the market to push the price up by 6-7 qian, reaching 36 liang at 2:30 PM, then decreasing by 5-6 qian. However, the market situation was very stable, and trading was sluggish. By 3:00 PM, the price was 5 liang and 4 qian. Subsequently, due to Macquarie entering US dollars for November at 8.125 and Mitsui absorbing half a yuan for September, sentiment was boosted, and buying interest surged.

<p>Other Bonds Also Showed a Continued Moderate Downward Trend</p>
<p>Market Situation Turns Active, Transaction Volume Reaches 6.9 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market conditions at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange showed very little spot trading. The total transaction volume for the day was only 11,000 yuan. The futures market suddenly became active, with considerable buying and selling interest. Transactions for 20 Customs Revenue Bonds and Salt Tax Bonds significantly exceeded previous levels. The total transaction volume reached over 3.8 million in the morning market and over 2.3 million in the afternoon market, totaling 6.9 million yuan. This was the highest transaction volume since the resumption of business. Among them, Consolidated Tax Bonds accounted for 1.39 million, Salt Tax Bonds 1.095 million, 20 Customs Revenue Bonds 690,000, and 20 Customs Revenue Bonds and Disbandment Bonds each accounted for 645,000 yuan. Other bonds also had transaction volumes of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Regarding the situation of various bonds, although the market situation was much stronger than the previous day, the price fluctuations were minimal due to the balance of supply and demand. The front and back markets remained in a state of consolidation. Although the trading activity was very active, the buying interest was also not idle. Therefore, although the prices were lower than the previous day, the overall trend was still moderate. Only the current month's Government Bonds showed a decrease of 1.1 yuan, while the July contracts and the current cash and July contracts of 20 Customs Revenue Bonds each decreased by a small 8 qian. The remaining bonds only decreased by approximately 4 qian, while the next month's contracts for Reorganization and Disbandment Bonds and current cash Customs Revenue Bonds showed a slight increase.</p>

<p>(Report by American Eastern Banking Corporation)</p>
<p>Wednesday's New York stock market remained very quiet. The market generally trended downwards throughout the day, but it unanimously rose near the close, eventually recovering to the previous day's original prices. The steel industry's production rate has fallen to 16%, and it is not expected to increase before August. Therefore, US Steel stock once fell, but the closing price was only 0.25 less than the previous day. Gasoline stocks were the most stable, with almost no fluctuations. The market for goods on Wednesday followed the same pattern as the stock market, initially weak and then strong. However, the market for government bonds fluctuated inconsistently. The only important news on Wednesday was President Hoover's plan to reduce armaments. Dealers generally waited for the results of important international negotiations, so they took a calm attitude towards the stock market. The Dow Jones index is attached below:</p>

<h3 id="e138">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market: Downtrend Difficult to Reverse <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>With Such Circumstances...How Can It Be Supported?</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, but the trend remained weak. With such circumstances, it is difficult to reverse. World commodity prices are falling sharply, so how can local yarn be supported? Therefore, sellers were eager to sell, and sentiment was depressed. The continuous price declines in recent days have been excessive. Today, the price broke through the 40 liang mark, and in the afternoon, it broke through the 39 liang mark. Later, those who had made profits covered their positions, and the market rebounded above the 40 liang mark. The overall situation remains dangerous, and actual demand is too sluggish.</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn: Morning Decline, Slight Afternoon Rebound: The People's Standard Yarn market opened in the morning with weak sentiment due to the weak US cotton market. Prices for all months broke through the 40 liang mark. As a result, prices for all months fell by 5, 8, 9 qian to 1 liang. The market opened again in the afternoon and fell further. The second round saw 8 liang and 8 qian. The closing price rose as short positions were covered, and all months moved above the 40 liang mark. The total transaction volume for the day was 37,500 units. It was found that Jifeng sold 1,550 bales, Yicheng 1,450 bales, and Changfeng 1,200 bales. Rongxing bought 3,050 bales, Changfeng 900 bales, Yukang 1,200 bales, and Yida 1,450 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Only 700 Bales of Yarn Sold: The clearing of current yarn remained sluggish. It was found that various groups bought a total of 700 bales for the day. Ten bales were bought by those in the same industry. Prices fell by 2 qian and a half to 5 qian. The customer group Yunnan bought 560 bales, mainland China 17 bales, Guangdong 50 bales, Shantou 20 bales, Weihaiwei 10 bales, Luzhou 5 bales, Anqing 8 bales, and Zhenjiang 12 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Cotton Market: Slight Rebound After Decline <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market initially declined and then improved, mainly because the weak US cotton market and the sharp drop in the yarn market caused fear. The market opened with a decline of 4 to 5 qian. However, the market sentiment tended to be firm and rose in the afternoon. It is generally believed that the price of cotton yarn in a certain country increased by several yuan because the exchange rate in that country sharply decreased, thus increasing prices. The silver price calculation has no significant impact. Actual demand from factories remained quiet. Some yarn factories are rumored to be reducing production due to the poor market conditions.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton: Afternoon Market Tends to Stabilize: The Zheng Standard Cotton market opened in the morning with weak sentiment due to the weak US cotton market. There was a lack of buyers, and prices for all months fell by 3 to 4 qian. The closing price rebounded by 1 to 2 qian. In the afternoon, prices for all months rose by another 2 to 3 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 75,400 dan. It was found that Zhengda sold 1,400 dan, Yichang 2,500 dan, Xincheng 2,200 dan, Yuchang 1,400 dan, Shenchang 1,600 dan, Tongxing 1,800 dan, and Changhe 1,900 dan.

<p>Shanghai South: Approximately a dozen boats arrived from various sources. However, the stock in Puxi was abundant, and retail sales in urban and rural areas were sluggish. Financial conditions tightened, and the weather gradually became hotter, causing sentiment to decline. Therefore, demand was sluggish, and the prices further decreased by 2 jiao. Early rice also followed by approximately 1 jiao. Thin rice was scarce, and the situation was set. Luyang tip was exhausted, and the market was sluggish.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Approximately twenty or so sources arrived from various groups. Trading in this street was sluggish and inactive. The morning opening saw Changxi North new fresh reduced by 1 jiao, and Zhongguan fell by 2 jiao. Early and late rice arrival and sales were balanced, and prices remained unchanged. Tongbian yinyuan were sold upon arrival, firm at 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Foreign Rice Continues to Decline by Approximately 1 Jiao in the Morning <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Customer Yuan Newly Arrived at 200 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday's "Foreign Rice" market situation continued the weakness of the past few weeks, and the situation was very poor. The morning opening price saw a small decrease of approximately 1 jiao for Xiao Jiao rice. Due to light trading and abundant stock, the morning trading was even lighter. After the price slightly decreased, sentiment remained bearish. In the afternoon, households from Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Jiangbei, and Ningbo took advantage of the low prices to make adjustments, and the market finally stabilized. The total market opening for Xiao Jiao rice was 1,200 bags. Special grade did not open. The market price for medium and inferior goods continued to decrease. Superior and medium grades only opened at 9 yuan 7 jiao and a half, while lower grades only opened at 9 yuan 5-6 jiao to 9 yuan 4 jiao and a half. 1 West Saigon bag was 200 bags, priced at 11 yuan and a half. There were no other transactions. Since foreign rice prices were high, various routes attempted to load and ship to Shanghai. After arrival, foreign rice prices had already started to fall, so no one inquired. Currently, there is still Wentai Zhou white rice and brown rice on the market, as well as a small amount of Anhui rice and Nanjing rice arriving, but there is no clearance. There are still a few Jiangxi machine rice in the customer yuan market. Last night, 200 bags of Wuhu machine rice newly arrived, which were superior and medium grade goods. Yesterday, the Ningbo group tried to handle 100 bags, priced at 14 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market saw that after opening in the morning, the market for various months was generally stable because the price of foreign wheat slightly improved by several points, coupled with the customer group also having intentions to buy. However, factory stocks were very abundant, and another sales channel could not really boost the market. It is known from the fact that the factory flour directly loaded to Tianjin is only around 8 qian, that factories are urgently seeking an outlet. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it had already turned soft. Although the Nanyang group had a slightly outgoing route, the inland and local factories continued to sell, causing the market to be sluggish. It is estimated that the subsequent steps will still be flat. As a result, July was down 7 li and a half, August down 5 li, September down 2 li and a half, October down 5 li, and November down 7 li and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Wheat Futures: Near Firm, Far Soft <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed that after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for various months showed a trend of near firm and far weak. For July and August, because the selling households were aware that local trading firms had successively taken them in, they paid close attention. Therefore, the trade was scarce, and the market atmosphere was considered chic. October and below were initially stable, but in the afternoon, it was rumored that an Australian No. 2 white wheat telegram was only offered at 3 liang 9 qian Shanghai yuan. The quotation was quite aggressive, but the factories did not inquire because it was not the time to place orders this year. However, with this rumor, sentiment became unstable. As a result, July was better than the previous day by 3 fen, August by 2 fen, September by 1 fen, October down 2 fen, and November down 2 fen. The current wheat market remained quiet for factories. Taiwan wheat opened at 2 liang 8 qian 2 fen, Shuangfeng wheat at 2 liang 9 qian, and Anting wheat at 2 liang 9 qian and a half, a total of 450 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Silk and Tea: Subtle Movements in "Chouxin Zhenmei" <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of this port, there was a slight stir in the "Chouxin Zhenmei" green tea from Wudong Tunxi and other areas. English trading houses such as Jinlong Baochang Tianxiang Dode were all actively processing it, and sales showed some activity. However, the asking price was 150 to 160 taels, slightly lower than before. Ordinary "Zhenmei" remained sluggish in the market. "Zhenmei," "Xiumei," and similar items were still being traded actively, and market prices were quite firm. Traders specializing in "Gongxi" tea from Wenzhou Yushan and other regions showed increasing interest, but negotiations with the Russian Aid Association for the upper and middle grades of goods had not yet reached a settlement. Persian merchants were also taking a wait-and-see approach, and there were no large-scale transactions reported.</p>
<h3 id="e146">New Wuyuan Tea Sales Active, Prices High <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Spring tea stockpiled in the villages of Beiyuan, Wuyuan County, and unsold, had been suffering from the sluggishness of the Shanghai market, and there had been difficulties in finding a way to sell it. Although the price had fallen to 48 yuan a few days ago, merchants still did not dare to start processing. However, in the past two days, various firms received telegrams from Shanghai warehouses reporting a turnaround, and the selling price of "Tunwu Gongxi Zhenmei" had opened at 80 taels, 30 taels higher than in previous years. Although the "Chouxin Zhenmei" market shrank, it could still be compensated for by the other. Therefore, well-funded and daring merchants began to consider purchasing the garden tea with excellent leaf quality. It was reported that several places in Beiyuan were negotiating sales of stored tea the day before yesterday, and the market price had rebounded from 48 yuan to 58 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the price two weeks ago. The long-dormant tea market has now begun to show signs of life. If the market for "Gongzhen" and by-products in Shanghai remains firm, it will not be difficult to clear the unsold tea in the mountains within the month. Previously, merchants had paid little attention to the new "Zhangshan" tea of the highest grade because they mostly processed "Zhenmei." Now that "Gongxi" is fetching a good price, this kind of tea with excellent water content and leaves is most suitable for processing "Gongxi." Tea firms in the northern part of the county have been sending people into the mountains to find it in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Tunxi Tea Market Gradually Improving <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The bleakness of the Tunxi tea market for the past month has been described in previous reports. Recently, firms have repeatedly received reports of improvement from the Shanghai market, with the selling price of "Gongzhen" higher than before, and news that the "Zhen" market is trending upward. Those who were previously dispirited are now regaining their appetites. Tea firms with large appetites are planning to add to their stock of tea at reduced prices. However, merchants and brokers, knowing that the Shanghai market is not bad, are confidently increasing prices and are unwilling to sell at the prices (50 yuan) that the firms are willing to pay. Therefore, there are still few who have reached agreements. As for the tea peddlers who sell to shops and stores, due to the urgent demand from North China and Tianjin, the asking price has soared to 34 yuan in recent days, which is the highest price rarely seen since tea peddlers began selling. The high-grade goods from Xiu and Wu counties have almost been completely bought up, but the demand for large quantities is not being met. Therefore, the tea market in foreign stores and trading houses in Tunxi has returned to a good state, without the depression of the previous month.</p>

<p>The Whole City Under Strict Security</p>
<p>Yesterday was the commemoration of the Shaji Massacre. The Chinese and foreign concessions in this city, fearing that reactionary elements would take the opportunity to riot, imposed a temporary curfew. A crowd gathering was discovered near the Eight Immortals Bridge and was dispersed by the police. Fortunately, the evening passed peacefully. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Strict Security: All districts under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were ordered yesterday to maintain strict security. All main roads had double posts. Police brigades, patrol car teams, and armed patrols, supervisors, and female inspectors were all dispatched to inspect pedestrians, especially in the areas of West Gate, Fangbang Bridge, North Little Gate, and East Little Gate, which were the strictest. Iron gates on the border between the Chinese and foreign concessions were only left open at Nanyang Bridge, Xie Bridge, North Little Gate, New North Gate, Old North Gate, and East Little Gate, as usual, to allow vehicles to pass through. Police stations in the Public Concession and French Concession were also ordered to step up precautions, especially in the areas of East Shanghai, West Shanghai, and the border with the Chinese Concession.</p>
<p>Dispersing Gatherings: Yesterday at 10:00 AM, near the Xiaocai Market in the French Concession's Eight Immortals Bridge, more than 80 people resembling workers and students were found gathering in preparation for a meeting. The political department of the French Concession police station had received a report in advance and immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain strict security in the area, and immediately took measures to disperse the crowd, so no incident occurred. Peace was restored in all places in the evening, and security gradually relaxed.</p>

<p>A Large Crowd Saw Them Off</p>
<p>Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters of the 19th Route Army, Zhang Yan, Brigade Commander of the 121st Brigade of the 61st Division, and more than a dozen personnel from the General Headquarters, took the Dutch mail ship "Nicaragua" from the New Customs Wharf at 8:30 last night to Xiamen, and then to Fuzhou. Representatives of the Shanghai National Salvation Federation, including Yin Zhiling, Yu Kang, Liu Jialun, Huang Menggui, Wu Bancang, and Guan Xingling, brought 100,000 firecrackers to see them off at the New Customs Wharf. Chief of Staff Huang showed the representatives the proposed plan for suppressing the communists, and presented the representatives with the speech he gave at the Suzhou Agricultural School as a farewell souvenir. When the ship was about to set sail at 9:50, they said goodbye again, shedding tears of farewell. Many relatives and friends of the representatives who had originally boarded a small steamer to return to the New Customs Wharf and disembark also went to see them off.</p>
<p>In addition to holding a grand farewell meeting for the 19th Route Army the night before, the National Salvation Federation specially made a famous domestic "Jingtailan Ding" (Cloisonne Cauldron) in Beiping as a farewell souvenir. The four characters "National Glory" (民族光榮), double-hooked (i.e., hollow characters, also known as "Feibai"), are inlaid with patterns on the cauldron. Moreover, the speech that Chief of Staff Huang gave to the association contained many insightful points, and the association plans to publish it in its own semi-monthly publication.</p>

<p>Seeking Peaceful Resolution</p>
<p>After the preparatory committee of the "Abolish Civil War League" was established in this city, it telegraphed to General Commander Chen in Guangdong and Naval Commander Chen in Qiongzhou yesterday, urging them to stop and seek a peaceful resolution, and also telegraphed to various groups in Guangzhou, urging them to dissuade and remonstrate. The various telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to Various Groups in Guangdong: To the Guangzhou Silver Industry Association and all groups: It is heard that Guangdong Province will launch a military attack on Qiongzhou due to the naval reorganization. Distant rumors believe that foreign troubles are imminent, and the fate of the country is at stake. How can there be energy to kill each other? In addition to separately telegraphing General Commander Chen and Commander Chen to stop and seek a solution, we urge you to jointly prevent it, persuade and remonstrate, and strive to achieve the goal and abolish the war. Details will follow later. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Abolish Civil War League respectfully salutes. Geng.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Two Chens in Guangdong and Qiongzhou: To General Commander Chen in Guangzhou and Naval Commander Chen in Qiongzhou: The invaders are pressing on the border, and the fate of the country is hanging by a thread. Internal stability and external resistance are the common goals of the whole country. It is heard that Guangdong Province will launch a military attack due to the naval reorganization, leading to suspicion. Distant rumors say that they will meet with force. Considering your wisdom and ability, you should know that there is no time to save the country at this time. How can you kill each other? Rather than allowing the invaders to take advantage of the situation, how about tolerating each other for the sake of the country? Please stop and seek a solution. Otherwise, no matter in whose name, the people of the country will never understand you. We respectfully offer our words and hope you will adopt them. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Abolish Civil War League respectfully salutes. Geng.</p>

<p>Sovereignty Cannot Be Infringed by Others</p>
<p>The Inland Public Debt Bondholders Association telegraphed to Nanjing yesterday, saying: To the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government of Nanjing: It is reported that the Northeast puppet state, at the instigation of the Japanese, forcibly seizes customs duties, and the people are indignant. Customs duties guarantee the funds for domestic and foreign debts, which are the basis of international credit to the outside world and the lifeline of domestic finance, which is of great importance. Northeast tax revenue amounts to 40 million yuan per year. If the debt credit is shaken due to the seizure, what a terrible disaster it would cause! Moreover, customs administration is a part of sovereignty, how can it be infringed by others? We earnestly request serious resistance to protect sovereignty and maintain national credit. We are filled with eager anticipation. The Inland Public Debt Bondholders Association respectfully salutes. Seal.</p>

<h3 id="e154">The Sugar Industry Association Reported that Japanese Sugar is Being Shipped to Hankou in Large Quantities <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Hankou Chamber of Commerce for Secret Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a report from the Sugar Industry Association that Japanese sugar is being shipped to Hankou in large quantities, sent a letter to the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting a ban on buying and selling. The letter stated: Dear Sirs, on the 22nd of this month, this city's Sugar Industry Association sent a letter stating: "We believe that violent Japan has not repented of its disasters, and for the sake of survival, our nation's economic severance from Japan should not be abandoned halfway. Moreover, the black soil of the Northeast is still occupied by foreign lands, and the Shanghai soil is still stained with blood. It is the time for us to endure hardship and learn from the pain. We have received reliable information that Japanese trading houses in this port have recently shipped large quantities of Japanese sugar to Hankou. After this sugar arrives in Hankou, it must be sold by a small number of traitors among Chinese merchants, who disregard shame and serve the enemy. If we do not take measures to prevent it, what a terrible disaster it will cause. Our association is deeply concerned and dare not remain silent. Therefore, we earnestly request your association to examine and approve this matter, and quickly forward it to the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, instructing the relevant trade associations to strictly prevent favoritism and effectively stop it, in order to implement the main objective of economic severance from Japan." Based on this, we believe that violent Japan despises our country. Although the Shanghai case has come to an end, the situation in the Northeast is becoming more and more pressing. If the people of the country have a conscience, they should encourage each other and persevere to the end on the matter of boycotting goods, so that we may achieve the final effect. Now it is said that Japanese merchants are shipping large quantities of sugar to Hankou. If our colleagues in Hankou take this opportunity to sell it, it would not only be disregarding shame and serving the enemy, but also a cause for ridicule by the Japanese. Therefore, we are informing you of the situation and hope that your association will investigate secretly if there is a large shipment of Japanese sugar to Hankou, and inform the sugar industry to collectively prevent the purchase and sale of the sugar. This is our sincere hope.</p>

<p>Wu Liande Suggested Reducing Tap Water Prices</p>
<p>The Taxpayers Association Advocated Launching an Epidemic Prevention Campaign</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Liande of the Seaport Quarantine Office sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association a few days ago, with important suggestions for summer epidemic prevention. After receiving the letter, the association forwarded it to the Public Works Bureau, requesting them to take it seriously. At the same time, they also replied to Dr. Wu, advocating that the municipal government, together with the authorities of the two concessions and civil groups, launch a widespread epidemic prevention campaign for a period of one month. Excerpts from the two letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Reply to Wu Liande's Letter: Dear Sir, we have received your letter, expressing concern for the health of the people and valuing human life, which we greatly admire. Your various proposals are all essential measures, and our association has forwarded them to the Public Works Bureau, requesting them to pay serious attention to them. However, our association has even further thoughts, believing that at this time, after the war and with the hot summer approaching, the spread of cholera is extremely worrying. The Shanghai Municipal Government should unite the Public Concession, the French Concession authorities, and civil groups to launch a widespread epidemic prevention campaign for a period of one month, so that the general public can understand the importance of prevention, and perhaps achieve a greater effect. Whether this is feasible, we would appreciate your consideration. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Bureau: Dear Sir, we have received a letter from Wu Liande, Director of the Seaport Quarantine Management Office and Director of the Central Cholera Prevention Office, stating that the cholera situation in Shanghai this year is not only earlier than in previous years, but also more rampant than in the past. From April 26, the date of the first case, until last week (June 11), a total of 280 cases of cholera were seen, but in the past week alone, there have been as many as 240 cases reported. The duty of this office is to do everything possible to prevent and avoid the spread of the epidemic, together with the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, the Public Concession, and the French Concession Health Department. However, the spread of the epidemic cannot be successful without the joint cooperation of all sectors and the entire public. Fortunately, it is not yet the hottest summer, and it is urgent to take precautions early to avoid the spread. The weekly cholera reports published by this office are nothing more than to awaken the public's attention to prevention. But in my opinion, the origin of cholera in Shanghai this year is (1) that laborers and the public do not have access to high-quality beverages, such as poor people not being able to afford expensive tap water; (2) the entire public should be advised to get vaccinated and cooperate with health authorities to disinfect latrines; (3) wells and rivers in remote areas should also be disinfected, and the public should be advised not to drink raw water or eat cut-up fresh fruit sold in the market. Other measures, such as finding ways to dispose of garbage and eliminate flies, are also necessary to address this cholera outbreak. The above-mentioned matters have been repeatedly elaborated in this office's weekly reports. Western newspapers have all rushed to publish them, but many Chinese newspapers still ignore them. Considering that your bureau is concerned about the interests of the people and social public undertakings, we hereby inform you and request that you quickly unite all sectors, discuss with the Chinese and Foreign Concession Water Companies to dredge the water pipes and reduce water prices, so that the poor people can enjoy clean beverages together. Secondly, advise the public to pay close attention to vaccination and latrine disinfection and natural water disinfection. The health authorities will naturally be responsible for guidance, but the public's facilities are very simple. I, Liande, have always been concerned about the public health movement, so I must thoroughly study the root causes of every event that occurs and find the best solutions. Whether my suggestions are appropriate, I hope you will consider them carefully. Upon this, we believe that Dr. Wu Liande's proposed methods for preventing cholera are indeed essential measures. At this time, with the hot summer approaching and after the war, if we do not take active measures, we fear that the spread will be difficult to control. We should request that the Water Company adopt the suggestions of dredging the water pipes and reducing the water prices, and at the same time instruct the Health Department to step up work on vaccination and various disinfections, broadcast announcements, prohibit the sale of cut-up fresh fruits and unhygienic cold drinks, and properly dispose of garbage to emphasize hygiene. This is our sincere hope.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Labor Dispute at the Concession Power Company, Party and Government Organs Intervene <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Company Agreed to Consider and Respond</p>
<p>Generally, It Can Be Resolved Satisfactorily</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Power Company dismissed 120 workers at the Feilun Road factory on June 4, it aroused the public outrage of more than 2,500 workers. Party and government organs investigated the company yesterday and agreed to respond to the workers on Monday. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Scheduled Response: At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the 120 workers who were dismissed by the company sent representatives to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau at Xiaonanmen, requesting that officials be sent to negotiate with the new manager, Hogans, to restore their jobs and avoid unemployment. The Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhang Sheng and others to go together at 10:00 a.m. to investigate the company in order to mediate. Hogans received them and agreed to consider the workers' demands and respond to the workers' representatives at 9:00 a.m. on Monday (the 27th). The labor side has decided to wait quietly for the company's response.</p>
<p>Company's Attitude: Hogans, the manager of the Power Company, said that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the electrical business has been greatly affected. He had to dismiss old employees who had worked for more than ten years without any faults in the past. When the business develops in the future, he will not hire new workers and will still employ old employees. He is now properly considering ways to deal with the dismissed workers and will soon be able to resolve the matter satisfactorily. The company has always treated its workers well, and the relationship between the two sides is very harmonious. There have never been any labor disputes. This incident is the first time.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng She Said That Sun Ke, a member of the Central Committee, took the Japanese Empress Wheel of Changxing Company to Hong Kong the night before last. The ship left Shanghai at 4:00 a.m. yesterday morning. It was heard that in addition to Fu Bingchang and Liang Hancao, there were also Tang Shengzhi, Zhang Huichang, and Huang Hanliang. It was heard that Hong Kong had telegraphed to invite Mr. Sun earlier, but Mr. Sun had not been able to go due to various matters. Mr. Sun received another telegram from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, stating that his wife, Ms. Chen Shuying, was ill in Macau, so Mr. Sun decided to go. After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Sun will visit Mr. Hu Zhantang to discuss party and government issues and exchange diplomatic opinions. Mr. Tang's trip also carries considerable tasks. It is rumored that an important meeting will be held in Hong Kong, but it has not yet been decided. According to people from Hong Kong yesterday, Chen Jitang invited Deng Zhiru and Zou Lu to Guangxi and invited Li Zongren to Guangdong to discuss the Southwest issue. If necessary, Li may go to Hong Kong. As for Mr. Sun Ke's trip to Qingdao, it may not become a reality.</p>

I deeply regret it. I have specially selected and sent a copy of the funeral oration, which reads: "Ten thousand miles of shared hatred, thinking of the generous sacrifice at that time, still remembering our homeland, rivers and mountains, still leaving regrets. Two lines of painful tears, lamenting that today's incense is a reward, should be brave ghosts with my dead soldiers." Please convey the above oration to the audience.

<h3 id="e160">International Problem Research Association Sends Off Ministers Jiang and Guo <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The International Problem Research Association, as our country's Minister to Japan Jiang Zuobin and Minister to England Guo Kangqi are about to take office, held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Bank Club to bid them farewell. Guests and hosts enjoyed themselves, and the grand occasion was as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Guests Minister Guo, and association members Chen Zheqing, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaoxu, He Dekui, Feng Bingnan, Guo Shun, Wang Jingqi, Zou Bingwen, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Xianglin, Gu Ziren, Guo Bingwen, and over forty others. Minister Jiang was unable to attend due to official business in Xun.</p>
<p>Farewell Address: Chairman Guo Bingwen delivered a farewell speech, roughly stating: In modern times, international relations are becoming increasingly complex, and diplomatic work is becoming more important. Since the September 18th Incident, our country's diplomacy has become even more strained. Our country's ambassadors to foreign countries have either been away from their posts on important business, or have not been able to take office due to special circumstances, or have not been appointed to vacant positions, resulting in important embassies lacking leadership, with significant impacts. Public organizations in Shanghai have repeatedly telegraphed the government to find a remedy. Now the government has specially appointed Mr. Guo Fuchu as Minister to England, and has urged Mr. Jiang Yuyan to return to his post as Minister to Japan. Minister Guo and Minister Jiang are known for their exceptional diplomatic skills. During the Shanghai Incident this year, Minister Guo's efforts were well-known to us. The country where Minister Jiang is stationed is particularly the focus of current diplomacy. As they are about to take office, with the two ministers' knowledge, experience, and skills, it is certain that they will be able to contribute to overcoming the current difficulties. This association takes the study of international issues as its purpose, and diplomatic work is naturally one of the association's important research problems. Today, we are holding this tea party to bid farewell to the two ministers with unlimited enthusiasm and hope. We deeply hope that the two ministers will make great efforts, and we also hope that they will not hesitate to inform us of diplomatic policies at any time. This association will also do its best to conduct systematic research and contribute to the two ministers' decision-making, striving for full understanding and cooperation between the government, the people, and diplomacy. Minister Jiang, due to important business in Xun, sent a reply stating that he may not be able to return in time to attend, but expressed his enthusiastic support for the association's purpose. The members hope that the two ministers will provide practical guidance on the association's work at any time, so that it meets the needs of the environment, which is our deepest wish.</p>
<p>Minister Guo's Reply: Minister Guo then replied, roughly stating: I am deeply unworthy of the warm send-off from your association today. I have read your association's declarations and work plans, and I am very impressed. I asked the chairman about your association's ultimate goal for diplomatic work, which is to achieve full understanding and cooperation between the government and the people. This is most appropriate. The diplomatic policy of our National Government was determined by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In a word, it is to unite with nations that treat us as equals, and strive together to achieve the goal of a world for all, universal love, and great harmony. In recent years, the country has faced many difficulties, and the people's spirit has been aroused, which can be used as a backing for diplomacy, but it needs someone to guide it onto the right track. Your association focuses on international issues, and will use the results of practical research to guide the public, so that their thoughts and actions on diplomacy are rational, in order to assist the government and diplomatic authorities. I am truly impressed.

<h3 id="e161">Yangtze River's Great Wall-Like Embankment Completed <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Greatest Project After the Great Wall</p>
<p>Constructed by 660,000 Disaster Relief Workers</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Will Be Free From Floods Forever</p>
<p>Last year's floods caused disasters in sixteen provinces, and more than 47 million people were displaced. After August 2nd, Wuhan was submerged in floods, and hundreds of thousands of refugees were taken in by Beijing and Shanghai. The government established a Flood Relief Committee and allocated funds for relief. At the same time, it used work as a form of relief, building a Great Wall-like embankment to fundamentally address the problem of flooding. This year, the river water continues to rise, and recent storms and heavy rains have raised the Yangtze River water level again. People are worried about being submerged again, but according to reporters' investigations, the Flood Relief Committee's Great Wall-like embankment is about to be completed. From now on, the Yangtze River will be free from floods forever. The fact that the people in the disaster areas of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces have not been completely dyed red this year is entirely due to the completion of this embankment, which allows the disaster areas to continue to cultivate and farm. The reporter's findings are detailed below:</p>
<p>Motivation for Building the Embankment: The Work Relief Office attached to the Flood Relief Committee planned water management projects and hired Xi Dejiong as the chief engineer. After investigating the floods in various ports along the Yangtze River, it was found that the breaches and collapses of the original embankments caused last year's unprecedented disaster. The fundamental solution for future flood prevention is to rebuild new and strong embankments along the Yangtze River. After the decision was made, 260 to 270 engineering experts were sent to the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to design the embankment construction.</p>
<p>Establishment of Bureaus for Management: After the designs were finalized, the Work Relief Office began work. The Yangtze River embankment was divided into sections starting from Shashi in the upper reaches, passing through Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, Datong, Wuhu, and all the way to Twelve Shoals in Yangzhou, winding for more than 10,000 miles, all being constructed simultaneously. Along the Yangtze River, 18 supervisory bureaus for embankment construction and work relief were established. Construction began last winter, and all engineering matters were under the jurisdiction of the Work Relief Office of the Shanghai Water Conservancy Committee.</p>
<p>Recruitment of Disaster Relief Workers: The long embankment along the river was rushed to be built in the spring of this year. 660,000 disaster victims from Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces were selected by the Flood Relief Committee and assigned to different sections to start construction. More than 1,100 supervisory committee members were also employed to supervise the progress. A large portion of the 430,000 tons of disaster relief wheat and flour purchased by the central government from the United States was allocated for the construction of the embankment. The relief method was calculated based on an area of 100 cubic feet of embankment. For every square of embankment built, the Work Relief Office provided 7.5 catties of relief wheat. The total amount of relief wheat distributed for the entire embankment required tens of thousands of tons.</p>
<p>Completion of the Embankment: The length of the embankment reaches more than 10,000 miles, and the area and height of the embankment are more than 20 English feet. The embankment construction is also very solid. Because there are many disaster relief workers and the construction is divided into sections, it has been completely completed to this day. The Flood Relief Committee will therefore be closed at the end of this month. According to the committee's announcement, although the tide has risen this year, the water level in Hankou is currently three feet and two inches and seven points, which is still far from last year. Even if it rises again, it can be guaranteed that the Yangtze River will never see floods again.</p>
<p>Dredging the Huai River: Last year, the Huai River breached, and northern Jiangsu also suffered floods. Dredging the Huai River has been loudly advocated for a long time, but no funds have been available to carry it out, resulting in the fertile land on both sides of the Huai River being abandoned. Now, while the Flood Relief Committee is building embankments along the Yangtze River, the Work Relief Office has also assigned more than 80,000 disaster victims from northern Jiangsu to dredge the Huai River, and a batch of relief wheat has been allocated from the disaster relief wheat for the Work Relief Branch to be responsible for carrying out the project. A total of three branches have been established, and more than 40 hydraulic engineering experts and more than 200 supervisory personnel have been hired. They are currently supervising the dredging work. From now on, hundreds of thousands of acres of wasteland on both sides of the Huai River will be turned into fertile land in one fell swoop, which will bring great production benefits to the country and the people.</p>

<p>Zhu Ziqiao, Director of the Disaster Area Work Group of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, telegraphed: Brothers Zhang Peilao, Cha Mianzhong, Xi Mingjiu, and Jin Guanfu of the Disaster Area Work Group, arrived in Xi'an on the afternoon of the 19th. On the 20th, they participated in the completion and water release ceremony of the Jinghui Canal at Junerzui in northern Wei. Representatives from the central government and various parties, Chinese and foreign charity organizations, representatives from overseas Chinese merchants in Honolulu, and foreign guests, both men and women, all gave solemn speeches. Chairman Yang also announced to the public that the farmland in the five counties irrigated by the Jing Canal would be permanently banned from growing tobacco, to show the government's and officials' determination to maintain the people's food supply. After inspecting along the canal, the water flowed smoothly, and the people were drawing water from the canal for irrigation with joy. The local people, young and old, who visited the canal construction were even more delighted and encouraged, and the road was blocked. Moreover, due to the recent severe drought in Guanzhong, the people were terrified of the disasters of previous years, and the demand for rain was extremely urgent. Although the people of the five counties have benefited from the Jing Canal, the people in other counties such as Wu, Fu, Qian, and Li, who are suffering from drought, are even more eager for rain. Witnessing the disaster, I am even more anxious. I plan to go to Luoyang immediately to participate in the completion ceremony of the Luoyang embankment project on the 22nd, and then arrive in Zheng on the same day. On the 22nd, I will take a special express train from Zheng and arrive around the afternoon of the 24th. Qinglan, Ma, (21st).</p>

<p>Stated that the Arsenal Was Ordered to Shut Down</p>
<p>My Position Will End at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Arsenal has been ordered to shut down. The director of the arsenal, Mr. Song Shijun, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The labor union heard that Song had arrived in Shanghai and immediately sent理事 Chen Yaohua and others to pay a visit. As a result, Song said that the official shutdown order from the Ministry of Military Administration had been received in Nanjing, but this was an order from above, and he really could not recover it. Moreover, even if it was not shut down, his position would definitely end at the end of this month. The representatives resigned without getting the key points and planned to find other ways to appeal to the government. Hu Sihong, the chief of the audit office, Zhang Cheng, the director of the artillery factory, and Lin Weirong, the director of the gun factory, who were sent to Nanjing the day before yesterday, have not yet returned. However, various military industrial equipment and ammunition that the Arsenal had stored in the Shanghai warehouse were transported back to Nanjing by car to the South Railway Station yesterday.</p>

Reporters went to Wu's residence on Gordon Road yesterday to inquire. According to his family, they had not received a telegram from Wu stating that he was leaving Hong Kong. The Coolidge President arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday, and Wu was not seen either, which proves that Wu is still in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Declaration of the Support Association for the Northeast War <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>So Painful It Cannot Be Read to the End</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Support Association for Northeast Soldiers issued a serious declaration on saving the country: All compatriots across the country, please be aware: Since the Japanese imperialists invaded our country, the Bixue case in Wanbaoshan has not yet dried, and the entire three northeastern provinces have been lost to non-resistant soldiers. Although the flames of war in Shanghai have temporarily stopped, the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast are still suffering in the depths of water and fire under the oppression of the brutal Japanese invaders. Death and burning are beyond the imagination of compatriots in the mainland. Alas, the country is dying day by day, how can we live? All my hot-blooded compatriots should endure hardship, save food and clothing, carry guns and transport money, and rise up to save the country. In the face of great disaster, empty talk is useless. Sacrificing oneself in danger is the way to become an adult. (Omission) Compatriots, the country has reached this point. What can't we give up to our compatriots? What benefit can't we throw away? When enemy shells are overhead, enemy goods are still flooding the market. The country's land has been lost, and the sound of civil war is still heard. In times of hardship, what else can be said? And there are things that cannot be said. Whenever a large number of patriotic compatriots gather to talk, they all say that we, the civilians who have no weapons, how can we resist the strong enemy's artillery fire? Although the saying is close to reason, it can only be understood in a tangible way. They do not know that the invasion of modern imperialists is not to seize other people's land by force, but to absorb people's money through economic and commercial means. National men and women compatriots of the unarmed class, if everyone does not buy or sell enemy goods, they can control the enemy's military expenses and the ability to manufacture guns and artillery. Especially the national business community, as the armed comrades of the business war in recent centuries, their intangible resistance to the enemy is even better than tangible guns and artillery. It's not that they can't do it, it's that they don't do it. Wearing enemy clothing is like wearing the bloody clothes of the armed compatriots on the front line. Eating enemy food is like eating the flesh and blood of the martyred compatriots. In short, the compatriots in the Northeast who are suffering and the armed compatriots who are fighting the enemy day and night in the rain of guns and bullets, why are they not our family members? After all, they are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Don't say that the three northeastern provinces are far away from our hometown, how can we not know that the brutal enemy's planes and warships can be overhead at any time? If the boots are burned, the body will be burned. If the country is lost, the family will be destroyed, and we will all be slaves. If the skin does not exist, what will the hair be attached to? We hope that compatriots across the country will contribute money to help the army, or raise money to purchase national defense weapons. Those who have no money should stand up and kill the enemy, and send people to promote it everywhere. The life and death of the country, the honor and disgrace of our descendants, are in a critical moment. If we let it go, it will be too late. The members of this association are willing to be pioneers and hereby declare.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jishng Hui received letters yesterday from the counties of Chang'an, Wugong, Fufeng, Jingyang, Liquan, and Qianxian in Shaanxi Province, and according to the report from the Chang'an Branch of the Association, the three years of non-stop disasters have left people unable to catch their breath, and drought has come again. In March of this year, during the growth period of spring wheat, the weather suddenly turned cold, black frost fell repeatedly, strong winds roared, and hail fell together. Within ten days, it spread throughout the province. Afterwards, although there was a penetrating rain, the seedlings had withered and the disaster had become inevitable. There was no way to save it. According to disaster reports and appeals from all sides, it has reached more than 20 counties, and those who have broken up their families and fled famine are even more displaced and suffering, which is unbearable to see and hear. I didn't expect the past catastrophe to be repeated again. Thinking about the future, how can we imagine it? Recently, we received the Shaanxi Relief Association's summary of the recent disaster situation in various counties and disaster maps. The branch association also received letters and telegrams from various counties asking for relief and immediately reported them. We beg you to widely need Hong Ci, deliver the publicity, or send letters to various places to appeal on your behalf, so as to clarify the true picture of the disaster in Shaanxi, in order to plan for relief. The surviving people after the disaster will celebrate their rebirth and are overwhelmed with gratitude, etc. After investigating the provinces of Jiangxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, etc., the water disasters and bandit troubles are as huge as that, and the disaster situation in Shaanxi Province is also so extensive. The people are sitting and robbing charcoal, and deaths follow one after another, which is unbearable to say. We can only use our sincere heart to feel sorry for the fellow charitable comrades.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Central Government's Opium Prohibition Order Anti-Drug Association Issues Declaration <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>One Side Doubts, One Side Urges</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association issued a special declaration yesterday regarding the opium prohibition order reissued by the National Government on June 18: On June 20, it was reported that the National Government ordered on the 18th, "Opium is a thing that harms the country and the people. The government is determined to ban it and has repeatedly issued orders and prohibitions. It has also successively promulgated various anti-smoking laws and regulations and set up special supervision and guidance agencies to urge progress. However, the country is vast and the examination may not be thorough. I am sincerely afraid that remote provinces will be complacent over time and fail to implement the prohibitions effectively, or blame the special circumstances of the local area and fail to eliminate the opium completely, resulting in the failure of previous efforts. Therefore, the prohibition is reissued with earnest warnings. In the future, local officials must strictly implement the current laws and regulations for the implementation of the smoking ban, and must not disobey and treat it as a mere formality. If there is still negligence, disregard for the prohibition, and harm to the local area, once discovered, the law will be enforced and punished separately." People across the country were overjoyed, thinking that the government was really reversing the chaos, working hard to govern, and saving this dangerous situation. Even this association was overjoyed when it suddenly read this order, thinking that the government has such a resolute and decisive spirit and implements policies that eliminate disadvantages. The government has a sincere intention to ban smoking. How dare we speak in vain? However, recalling the terrible facts of the past and the tragic scenes vividly in our minds, we cannot help but worry too much and dare not believe it, based on the authorities' previous inconsistent words and deeds. People are afraid of tigers, and everyone has this feeling. Punishing the past and not forgetting the past pain is the feeling that the Chinese people should have. It is not only the association. I still remember that last spring, when the theory of public opium sales was first circulating, the people across the country secretly rose up in opposition. The authorities, fearing public anger, once said, "Public opium sales are not true," to appease the people's opposition. However, within two months, "Anti-Smoking Inspection Offices" were established in various provinces. The people continued to protest, and the government announced the cancellation and reiterated the prohibition. Unexpectedly, the brewing of a disguised opium sales management agency for narcotic drugs followed one after another. How the government treats the people in this way, how can the people trust the government? Recently, the authorities have both sown the tide of public opium sales and issued an order to reiterate the ban on smoking. It is unpredictable and changes are unpredictable. Is the authorities still following their old tricks? The people are really half-believing. Moreover, as the prohibition states, "The government is determined to reject it and has repeatedly issued orders and prohibitions." The so-called "three orders and five applications" are nothing more than empty documents, based on past facts. Facts are there, how can you not be familiar with them? The so-called "the country is vast and the examination may not be thorough" The government cannot justify itself on this point. The area is remote, so let's put it aside based on the government's statement that the examination is not thorough. How far is Nanjing from the capital and the counties north of the Yangtze River? The government in the Weiyang area is everywhere. Why did the government really see it? Luoyang is located in the temporary capital, and the tobacco disaster in Henan Province is the most serious in the country. Are other provinces such as Fujian, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei also remote places? Public opium sales were first implemented and the harm of poison spread. It is unbearable to hear. It is true that the government has never examined or has examined but deliberately kept silent. The so-called "Once discovered, the law will be enforced and punished separately" is even more irritating. It is hoped that the government can "enforce the law and punish separately." However, the government treats them with grace or allows them to be free from the law. Although the people have repeatedly appealed for legal action, the government is still silent. The association is eager to reject drugs and does not feel that the words are long. Loving the party and the country is even more important than others. We do not dare to criticize the government's decrees slightly, but we think that governing does not lie in many words, and facts are the most powerful defense. If the government has the sincere intention to ban smoking, it should take practical actions in addition to the shining orders. Moreover, rumors are very strong outside. There are anti-smoking authorities who have not given up on public opium sales and plan to adopt a policy of banning it in the open but secretly implementing it. On the one hand, they indicate that various provinces are selling it publicly and the central government will not interfere. Use its "divide and conquer" trick. Based on our observations of all parties in recent days, we cannot regard this news as absolutely unfounded. We hope that the government can eliminate the confusion of villains and strive to implement the prohibition, so as to punish the facts and show the people of the country to strengthen the people's trust in the government. The association will follow the people of the country and strongly support the government's measures to vigorously ban smoking, so as to complete the legacy of rejecting drugs. Otherwise, the members of the association will still not be able to give up their responsibilities as long as they have a breath left. I hereby declare.</p>

On the other hand, personnel were dispatched to hire a car to transport all the tools of making a living in the cigarette paper shop to the team, including one piece of luggage, seven quilts, three boxes, three suitcases, 420 yuan in paper money, 18 yuan in silver coins, one gold earring, four hand-folded books, fourteen pawn tickets,</p>
<p>One Marriage Certificate And Miscellaneous Items such as iron bed frames, etc., were all sealed by Captain Xu of the Bandit Suppression Department and transferred to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for safekeeping. It is reported that the bandits kidnapped Fu Zhongde, the principal of Dongshan Zhongde Girls' School (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly wrote Dexiu), from Suzhou, age 29, in November of last year, hiding her for seven months and thirteen and a half days. Because no ransom was paid, the bandits tore up the ticket.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Chen Longsheng Murders Ye Daxing's Wife <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Commits Murder Out of Embarrassment for Demanding Debt</p>
<p>Falsely Accuses the Deceased of Immoral Behavior</p>
<p>Chen Longsheng, also known as Sun Rongsheng, 35 years old, from Nanjing, worked repairing burlap bags and resided at number 88, Xinkang Li, Taopeng Road. The sub-landlord was Ye Daxing. His wife, Wu, age 42. At about 8 PM on the 19th of this month, the Ye couple and fellow villagers Song Afu, Chen Caipin, and others were playing mahjong for entertainment. Wu demanded 39 yuan from Chen to use as gambling money. Chen first returned two yuan. Wu considered the amount too small and argued with him. Unexpectedly, Chen became furious and took out a small knife from his sleeve, stabbing Wu's neck and other places. Ye Daxing, seeing Chen fighting with his wife, stepped forward to dissuade him and was also stabbed in the back of the neck. When he tried to snatch the knife, the web between his thumb and forefinger was cut. He immediately ran out and called for the police. Chen took the opportunity to escape. Seeing Wu lying in a pool of blood, barely alive, she was rushed to Tongren Hospital. Due to the severity of her injuries, with nine stab wounds to her neck, she soon died. The body was taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Fairlane Road. The next morning, a prosecutor commissioned by the Special Court examined the body and ordered it to be coffined. Ye Daxing's injuries were relatively minor, and after treatment by a doctor, his life was out of danger. The day before yesterday, Hua Tan Gui Shou of the Yulin Road Police Station arrested the murderer Chen Longsheng in the Small World Amusement Park in the city and detained him at the relevant Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning, he was brought back to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Presiding Judge Qiao Wanxuan opened the court for interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, stated the case, saying that the defendant's murder weapon was hidden by him after the incident at number 333, Wuzhou Road. The defendant initially refused to confess, but after strict interrogation, he said it was under the incense burner in the house. The detectives searched but found nothing. Later, it was retrieved from a hidden ditch in the patio. He then presented the knife for inspection and requested severe punishment. Subsequently, the plaintiff Ye Daxing complained that he was the chief clerk at the Yihua Yarn Factory in Yangshupu, but his injuries were not serious. The defendant was a tenant and recounted the facts of the incident. Song Afu testified that he was a neighbor and saw the plaintiff couple and Chen Caipin playing mahjong at the time. He saw the defendant come down from upstairs to the living room to return two yuan to Ye Wu (the deceased). Because she thought it was too little, she wanted him to increase it, which led to an argument. He also wanted him to compensate for the damaged components. The defendant asked what he wanted to compensate for. Wu said you know yourself. The defendant was furious and punched Wu in the face. He suddenly saw blood flowing from Wu's neck and realized she had been injured with a weapon. Ye Daxing rushed to dissuade him and was also stabbed. Chen Caipin testified that Ye Daxing was his master. He saw the defendant return two yuan to his master's wife. Because it was too little, he wanted him to increase it but failed, which led to an argument. The defendant said that he wanted her life today, and then punched her wildly. He then took out a small knife and stabbed his master's wife, who immediately fell to the ground. When questioned, the defendant Chen Longsheng confessed that his real name was Sun Rongsheng. Because he stayed with the Chen family, he changed his name to Chen Longsheng. He had known the deceased for five years. He used to live on Meizhou Road and later moved to Xinkang Li, living together for about a year. However, Wu and Ye Daxing also had an affair. The thirty yuan he borrowed from Wu was actually usurious money. She forced him to pay it back at the time, and in a fit of anger, he stabbed her. The reason was that Wu had recently had an affair with his apprentice Chen Caipin and abandoned him. Hearing this, Ye Daxing stated that the defendant's confession was completely false. Chen Caipin said that he was only 23 years old and his master's wife was 42 years old. How could such an immoral thing happen? He asked for a clear judgment. Judge Qiao reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be taken back into custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks Central Government to Eliminate Labor-Management Disputes <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Both Sides Should Maintain Understanding and Concession</p>
<p>To Get Through This Unprecedented Difficult Situation</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday requested the Party and government organs to eliminate labor-management disputes and increase production, and submitted a petition to the Central Party Headquarters, stating that the association held the third session of its members' meeting on June 18. According to the proposals of members Luo Qinghua, Tu Kaizheng, Pan Xusheng, Lu Fengzhu, Zheng Chengqing, Ye Jiaxing, Wang Yansong, Xie Zhongle, Ma Shaoquan, Shao Baoxing, Shen Jisi, Wang Zefu, etc., it was requested that the Central Government issue an order to all local Party and government organs to earnestly eliminate labor-management disputes, increase the production of domestic goods, and cultivate strength to save the country from its difficulties. It was resolved and submitted to the Central Government for approval. It has been found that in recent years, the provinces of Yu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei have been severely disrupted by Communist bandits, and the rural organizations have long been completely destroyed. The northwestern provinces have also been plagued by years of severe drought, and villages have become ruins. The provinces of Hebei and Shandong are relatively complete, but since the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang were occupied by Japan, the road for the two provinces to immigrate to Guanwai has also been cut off. As for the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they are still slightly better in the southeast, but due to the poor harvest of silkworms, the closure of silk factories, and the war in the Songhu-Jiatai area, workers have lost their jobs, and farmers have abandoned silkworm rearing, which has also become a precarious situation. This phenomenon, recursively promoted and developed, will inevitably turn all the good people of the country into starving corpses and bandits. This is truly the most serious situation in the past 20 years of the Republic of China. Although European and American countries have been thrown into unprecedented panic by unemployment problems, the foundation of their industrial countries has been consolidated, and overseas markets are sufficient to rely on as a retreat. The recovery of vitality is still easy to deal with. If our country has no industrial base and the countryside is on the verge of collapse, the degree of difference is no different from the sky. At this time, if we want to seek a way to remedy the situation, we can only strive to produce, so that workers have jobs and agricultural products have sales channels. Then, the national livelihood may be transformed from thorns into a smooth road. In this stormy situation, labor and management should maintain mutual understanding and concession in order to overcome this unprecedented difficult situation. The Party and government organs that handle labor-management disputes should also take into account the current situation in our country and not pursue lofty theories anymore, so that those with some financial resources will not be afraid of engaging in industry and that the habit of concentrating cash in one corner of the city and concentrating investment in the concession real estate can be gradually changed. Otherwise, it will be like Jia Yi said, "If you don't cure it now, it will become a chronic disease. If you can't secure the interior, how can you talk about resisting foreign aggression?" All of the above, the cultivation of national power, is intended to start with earnestly eliminating labor-management disputes and increasing the production of domestic goods. It is reasonable to prepare a document and submit it to the Cabinet for review and approval for implementation, which is truly convenient for the public. Respectfully presented to the Central Party Headquarters.</p>

<p>The Continental News reported that the German Consul General Baron Quelenberg and his wife returned to Shanghai yesterday morning (the 22nd) after taking a long vacation to travel the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The journey was delayed by ten days due to shallow water in Yichang, making navigation difficult. Consul General Quelenberg described his travel experience yesterday, praising the beauty of the Three Gorges as the "Land of God," which everyone should visit. He felt relaxed and extremely happy during the trip. He saw Sichuan soldiers opening up to E one after another, all well-equipped, with strong and disciplined soldiers. Their clothing and equipment were better than those of the Nineteenth Route Army fighting in Shanghai. It is expected that the bandits will be overwhelmed by them. He also saw that the embankment construction project has made great progress. There are huge new embankments in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to prevent future floods. The agricultural production along the river seems to be able to get a harvest that has not been seen for many years. Yichang is now booming in industry and commerce, which is a sign of the sound economic conditions in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Porcelain Industry Association Petitions for the Abolition of Porcelain Production and Sales Tax in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Porcelain Industry Association submitted a document to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that it recently received a letter dated June 7 from the Preparatory Office of the Jingdezhen Jing City Porcelain Merchants Association of Jiangxi, stating that the Jiangxi Provincial Government recently decided to restore the porcelain production and sales tax (excerpt). Regarding the future of the porcelain industry, the industry was convened to discuss at a meeting. In this time of natural disasters and man-made disasters, when people are struggling to save themselves, how can they add heavy taxes to reduce their vitality? A unanimous resolution was passed to oppose the tax increase in Jiangxi Province. Porcelain is a major product of our country. In recent years, the people of the country have been frightened by the economic invasion of imperialists and have been seeking to promote it. There was originally an opportunity for development, but it was trapped by heavy taxes and tolls, which increased costs and made sales difficult. Foreigners were exempted from taxes and competed for sales, which led to foreign porcelain filling the country, especially Japanese goods. They have become the main force, and domestic porcelain has almost no foothold. Check the customs trade records, and the import of foreign porcelain has increased year by year, which is very alarming. The National Government saw the crux of the problem and proposed to reduce the tolls and increase the taxes. It resolutely issued an order to implement the toll reduction from the first day of the first month of the 20th year, sweeping away the malpractices that had plagued businesses and harmed the people for decades. The merchants and people cheered and hoped for the revival of the country. Unexpectedly, the Communist bandits were rampant and ravaged several provinces. Jingdezhen was repeatedly hit by bandit disasters, with cruel burning and killing. Last autumn, floods raged, and the people were in dire straits. Suffering was linked to suffering, reaching its extreme. The natural disaster had just been announced, and the national crisis struck again. Violent Japan took advantage of our natural disaster and sent troops to forcibly occupy the three northeastern provinces and attack Shanghai, which affected the whole country, and the economy was affected. Now, after the ceasefire and troop withdrawal, the people are deeply scarred and full of devastation. The government should try its best to appease the exiles and comfort the bereaved to seek recuperation, but Jiangxi suddenly has a proposal to restore the porcelain production and sales tax, which is like a disguised Lijin and seriously violates the National Government's order to reduce tolls. This cannot be recognized. In a country ruled by law, all increases and changes in taxes that increase the burden on the people must be based on laws and regulations. Jiangxi's tax increase this time has no laws and regulations from the central government, and it has a suspicion of violating the law and harming the people. This cannot be recognized. When foreigners are economically invading and conspiring to plot against us, people reduce and exempt taxes and compete for sales, while we increase taxes to block the development of domestic products, which is tantamount to suicide. This cannot be recognized. Now, after the natural disasters and bandit disasters, there are remnants and the national crisis. The people's livelihood is haggard. How can we bear to add heavy taxes to destroy their vitality? This cannot be recognized. Since the violent Japanese invaded Shanghai on January 28 and fought for several months, the national economy has been affected. Porcelain merchants in various places owe Jingdezhen kiln owners money and cannot repay it. If taxes are increased again, it will be difficult to maintain. Kiln owners will stop production in conjunction, and hundreds of thousands of workers will lose their jobs, endangering the livelihoods of the common people. This cannot be recognized. Moreover, porcelain merchants from various provinces handle goods with no fixed itinerary and are itinerant in nature. Therefore, there are no tax items for business tax, which shows that the national government can sympathize with the people's suffering, but the local government cannot uphold the virtues and intentions and instead destroy and plunder, which is extremely harmful to the people's livelihood. It is urgent to beg your association to give assistance and quickly forward it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Industry of the National Government, ordering the Jiangxi Provincial Government to abide by the National Government's order and abolish the restoration of porcelain production and sales taxes similar to Lijin in order to value the law and protect the business community. Waiting for orders anxiously. Respectfully presented.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of this month, at the intersection of the cemetery near the Hardoon Garden at the west end of Avenue Foch in the French Concession, at around 11 AM, a case in which one male and one female student from a primary school were kidnapped by bandits has been without news for a long time. Their family members were at a loss.

Five more suspects were subsequently captured, and one male and one female child were rescued. After notifying the principals to take back the two children, they were escorted to the police station for interrogation and investigation.

<p>The Shanghai South District Fire Joint Association always holds a memorial service for its predecessors and a general meeting on the 20th day of the fifth month of the abolished lunar calendar. Yesterday (the 23rd, which is the 20th day of the fifth month of the abolished lunar calendar) was the due date. The national flag was hung high at the gate of the association on Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen. At about 11 o'clock in the morning, all members of the general meeting of the Southeast, Northwest, and other districts under its jurisdiction, all wearing uniforms, copper hats, and leather boots, drove fire trucks to the meeting. About 200 people signed in. At 11:45, all members gathered in the meeting place upstairs to publicly commemorate the deceased members and directors of each district. Wang Yiting presided over the ceremony, Mao Zijian read the sacrificial text, He Yongsheng, the director of the Eastern District, Zhu Liangcai, the director of the Southern District, Xia Guoliang, the director of the Western District, and Lu Hongyi, the director of the Northern District, served as deacons. The ceremony was completed in about 30 minutes. All members had lunch at the meeting. The general meeting was held at 1 PM, presided over by Mao Zijian. He reported on the purpose of the meeting and the progress of the association in the past year. Then, Qian Qinghao, a member of the Western District, reported on the Xieqiao fire and the case where the Second District did not report to the association. It was resolved that after sending a letter to the Second District, local interests would be the priority in the future, and the police would be reported as soon as possible. He Yongsheng, the director of the Eastern District, proposed to change the award certificate to a silver shield medal, which was approved. The chairman proposed whether the medal should be exchanged, which was resolved not to be exchanged. By the time the meeting was adjourned, the clock had struck four.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Store Silk and Wait for a Good Price <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The sluggishness of the silk market in this port's foreign firms has reached its extreme. Chinese silk merchants are all in a situation where they will never recover. Recently, the spot silk in Lyon has shown some activity, and Shanghai white factory warp B pattern textiles have risen from more than 400 taels to more than 500 taels, but the silk market is still holding steady. Yesterday, according to a certain factory silk merchant, the reason for this is that the total amount of silk stored in Shanghai warehouses has reached 30,000 to 40,000 bales. Even in terms of white factory warp, the cost of the silk for the owners is more than 1,000 taels. After entrusting the silk number to sell the silk, the advance money of 800 to 900 taels has been used up (silk numbers and silk warehouses that sell factory warp and other silk in Shanghai usually advance money). Because the foreign firms were stagnant and difficult to sell for a while, the silk numbers mortgaged the silk to the financial industry, and each bale was also mortgaged for 600 to 700 taels of silver. Now, although the price of silk has risen to more than 500 taels, it is still not enough to cover the principal and interest of the mortgage, as well as warehouse rent, insurance, and other expenses. There is still a difference of more than 200 taels. If it is sold at the current market price, the owner will not only lose money but also have to pay off the advance money of the silk number and the insufficient principal and interest of the financial industry. Therefore, both the owner and the silk number are unwilling to sell immediately and insist on keeping the goods on hold, willing to add discount interest to wait for the opportunity. Seeing this, if the price increase of the foreign silk market is not high, there is no possibility of a smooth transition for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Hongkou Chang'an Lane Tenants Petition Landlord for Rent Reduction Yesterday <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Tenants of Chang'an Lane on Wusong Road, Hongkou, after establishing the Rent Reduction Movement Committee, submitted a request to the Municipal Rent Reduction Committee, asking them to negotiate with the landlord, the Catholic Church, for the exemption of rent during the war. The landlord has not yet responded. Yesterday, all the tenants of the lane jointly petitioned the landlord, the Catholic Church, because Rongye Lane and Public Security Lane nearby have already had notices posted by their landlords, Jardine Matheson and Company and Kung Ho Yanghang, voluntarily exempting rent for three months, but this lane has not yet implemented this. The letter stated: "To the esteemed Church, we, the tenants, have been renting your church's houses in Chang'an Lane for many years. The relationship between landlord and tenant has been harmonious. We have always paid the rent on time without any disputes. Unexpectedly, the catastrophe of January 28th arrived this year, and the Hongkou area became a war zone. This lane was especially important. During the war, the tenants fled in a hurry, and thanks to the grace of the landlord, they were able to escape with their lives. However, although their lives were saved, their property was plundered by demons. All of this is evident to everyone. Recently, the ceasefire agreement has been reached, and we have had to move back to our original homes. The walls are bare, and the essence has been lost. The tenants are in pain and do not want to live after suffering this catastrophe. At this time, landlords in various lanes of the city, out of consideration for the tenants, have voluntarily exempted rent to show their generosity. Only this lane has not implemented it. The tenants have requested your church, but it has not been approved. Even the rent for January and May has not been collected by anyone. We do not know what the intention is. We hereby jointly petition again, and sincerely request your church to follow the compassionate will of our Lord, have a heart for helping the needy, and immediately exempt the rent for February, March, and April during the war in this lane. As for the rent for January and May before and after, we will do our best to pay it in order to express our gratitude. We cry and plead, and await your review." In addition, the tenants of the lane believe that the rent for February, March, and April should be exempted, but the landlord has not collected the rent for January and May before and after. They fear that the landlord will falsely accuse them of resisting rent and file a lawsuit in court. Therefore, they reported it to the Municipal Rent Reduction Committee to forward it to the Special District Court for filing to prevent deception. At the same time, they remitted the rent for January, May, and February to the bank for safekeeping, waiting for a solution.</p>

<p>Transaction Not Completed Due to Price Difference</p>
<p>After the death of Huang Chujiu, a prominent Shanghai merchant, his Gongfa Company, Riye Bank, Great World Amusement and Savings Department all went bankrupt at the same time. The creditors filed lawsuits to recover their debts. Later, accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng were appointed to liquidate the assets, and Huang's family handed over private property for compensation. Two installments of debt payments have been made. Now, the Longmen Road Huang Chujiu Hospital, founded by Huang, has not been successfully auctioned. The Second Special Court issued a notice to solicit bids. Yesterday was the day for the court hearing for the auction of the hospital. At 2 PM, Judge Cao Jun, accompanied by clerk Chen Weihan, took the bench in the Civil Court No. 2 and announced the progress of the auction. Present were creditor representatives Lawyer Yan Luqing, Wanchun Yintuan Lawyer Peng Qi, Huang's family representatives Tan Yigong, accountant Pan Zhaobang, etc. Judge Cao announced that since the auction of Huang Chujiu Hospital, only the New Medicine Ye Gong Association had offered 17,000 yuan. Because the price difference was too large, the sale was not completed. The matter will be reviewed again in three days. After the lawyers present expressed their opinions, the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Lawyer Zhang Shizhao's Argument on the Yuansheng Case</p>
<p>Shareholders Yu Shouzheng and Luo Kunxiang of Yuansheng Gold Shop sued the general manager and shareholder Shi Zian, and shareholder Tian Hongnian, for jointly breaching trust and embezzlement. The First Special District Court has repeatedly summoned them. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge, announced the verdict in court the day before yesterday (the 22nd). Shi Zian and Tian Hongnian were found guilty of jointly breaching trust and were each fined 1,000 yuan. If they fail to pay the fine, they will be sentenced to imprisonment for one day for every three yuan. The part concerning Shou Fuchen was not accepted (in this part of the case, the plaintiff had withdrawn the case in court). The incidental civil lawsuit part was transferred to the civil division of this court for trial. The above information has been recorded in this newspaper. It is understood that the subject matter of this case involves a huge sum of more than 240,000 yuan. Both parties are well-known figures in the gold industry, and the lawsuit has attracted much attention from society. The first instance has been judged, and it cannot be said that it has not come to an end. Lawyer Zhang Shizhao is the agent for the plaintiff. Now we have obtained Lawyer Zhang's argument on the 15th and publish it as follows. It is believed that those who pay attention to social news will be happy to read it.</p>
<p>In terms of appearance, this case seems to belong to civil affairs, but tracing the details of its construction and the circumstances of the parties' confrontation, it is clearly a serious criminal case that goes beyond the ordinary. There is no doubt about this. Why do I say this? If Shi Zian, as the manager, accidentally made a mistake, resulting in some losses in the shop (regardless of the amount), he should have tried his best to prevent it beforehand, reported it to the shareholders in time, and then worked with the shareholders to plan for the aftermath, taking the lead in the difficult situation, and providing all the existing funds in the shop to jointly consider the priorities and repay the debts. If this were the case, he could have filed a lawsuit to pursue all the losses, regardless of who should be held responsible. This would truly be a civil lawsuit. If we speculate, at that time, Shi Zian would have gained the considerable sympathy of the shareholders, and based on the principle of forgiveness, a plan to settle the matter would have been devised. The case may have been settled through private mediation, and it would have been impossible to predict that it would be prosecuted. But now, according to the facts, it is very different. Shi Zian has been the general manager of Yuansheng Shop for many years. The following five points are worthy of consideration. Zian is experienced in handling affairs and worthy of the word "seasoned." He never accommodates customers, and even shareholders who come to the shop to buy and sell must follow the rules strictly. However, he is unique in treating Tian Hongnian differently, allowing him to lose more than 200,000 yuan without any prevention. This is the first point. Yuansheng has been thriving for four years and has had profits every year. Only the shortest period after August last year was reported as a loss. How much was lost is all on the books, which is the more than 200,000 yuan that Zian admitted was owed by Tian Hongnian. Where did the 50,000 taels of capital and several tens of thousands of yuan of accumulated profits go? This is the second point. Yuansheng suffered because of Tian Hongnian alone. Hongnian is his brother-in-law and also the manager of the China Exchange Bank. Zian indulged in kinship and was intimidated by his power, colluding with him to seek unexpected wealth and diverting funds from the China Exchange Bank to cover his losses. This is the third point. Everyone in the shop, from the general manager down, is Shi and Tian's confidants. Yu Shouzheng and other shareholders have never been involved in the shop's affairs from the beginning. This is the fourth point. Those who do business on the exchange often establish accounts, which easily lead to fraud and confusion. This is obvious to everyone. Now, Tian Hongnian has established as many as seven or eight accounts, such as Hongji, Huifu, Jinji, Pinji, Hongji, Deji, and Nongji. Shi Zian allowed him to do so without preventing him. The traces of collusion are obvious. This is the fifth point. Based on these five points, Shi and Tian lost more than 200,000 yuan. What kind of blame should they bear? Even a fool can understand this. When the shop was in urgent need of funds and the China Exchange Bank was pressing for the repayment of debts, Zian suddenly fled, claiming that "the China Exchange Bank's matter was about to take direct action against me. I am unable to cope with my sick body and have no choice but to temporarily retreat in order to protect myself and gain time." (See lawyer Yuan Yang'an's letter of January 18.) If the China Exchange Bank were to take direct action against Zian, Zian's escape would inevitably lead to direct action against other shareholders due to joint liability. How could Zian not know this? As a result, Yu Shouzheng and others returned 150,000 yuan to the China Exchange Bank, and the matter was resolved. This is in line with the meaning of Article 366 of the Criminal Law, "Intending to cause illegal damage to oneself, and acting in violation of one's duties, resulting in damage to one's property." There is absolutely no doubt. The letter also says, "I have no choice but to temporarily retreat in order to protect myself." The original text of the Criminal Law regarding "handling affairs for others" caused huge losses, and the cause of the huge losses was entirely due to himself. In the end, he escaped and claimed to be protecting himself. Everyone wants to protect themselves. Now, the person who caused the disaster is using self-protection as an excuse to leave, causing the third party who was entrusted to him and does not ask questions to be unable to protect himself, resulting in a huge sacrifice. This is so obvious that he intends to harm others for his own benefit. This constitutes a crime of violating his duties, which is so serious. The aforementioned Yuansheng's capital and accumulated profits were all spent by Zian alone. According to Article 356 of the Criminal Law, "Intending to illegally possess for oneself or a third party property owned by others that one holds." How fitting is this? In short, Shi Zian advertised himself as being serious about his work, so that the shareholders mistakenly regarded him as someone they could always rely on, and entrusted the shop's affairs to him completely without ever questioning him. This is the extreme of "trusting" Zian. Zian then "betrayed" them, and the extent of his betrayal was inversely proportional to the shareholders' trust in him. His crime is a thorough and vivid explanation of the word "breach of trust" in the Criminal Law. The law emphasizes the intention to punish. Zian's intention can be said to be extremely vicious. All of these facts are enough to embellish this case and make it a major criminal case, and that's not all. After the shop closed down, Shi Zian still concealed the only remaining funds in the shop, dared to establish a private account, deposit it in Hongxiang Qianzhuang, and then privately withdrew a part of it for free distribution according to his own will, and secretly sent letters to his partners Song Fuchen and others, ordering them to quickly divide the money to prevent the shareholders from knowing and confiscating the money. When the China Exchange Bank's huge debts were about to affect the shareholders, Zian saw it very clearly. He had to destroy every last bit of the remaining amount to make himself happy. In other words, Zian was afraid that the shareholders would not bear the obligations that they should not bear, and he was afraid that the shareholders would not enjoy the rights that they should enjoy. Such a state of mind is something that even ordinary petty people cannot bear to do. According to the law, how high did Zian's intention to embezzle reach? I believe that the presiding judge will be shocked by his free conscience. Who would say that it is not appropriate to call it a serious criminal case? The money in Hongxiang is also an occasional discovery of Zian's total embezzlement. It is not difficult to estimate that there are still many undiscovered ones. When he secretly deposited the remaining money in Hongxiang, he refused to reveal any traces to the shareholders. If the shareholders had no way to detect the crime and did not know about this money, Zian would have immediately taken it for himself and embezzled it to the end. It goes without saying. When the matter was exposed, Zian lied and said that it was other people's deposit and the dividends that the partners should have received. What is the harm in letting the shareholders know about other people's deposits and the dividends that the partners should have received, which are part of the shop's debts? Saying that the shareholders will only collect "debts owed to them" and not care about "debts they owe" is evidenced by the character and behavior of the shareholders that Zian knew and the facts before and after. Even if he lost all conscience, I am afraid he could not say this. Moreover, the so-called partner dividends have already been offset by outstanding debts. In fact, the money is no longer there. Since the money is only a nominal amount, Zian took the actual money away. Finally, under the repeated requests of his partners, Yu Shouzheng still advanced more than 2,300 yuan to them (receipt submitted to the court). It can be seen that the shareholders will never let people down. Now Zian's remarks are nothing more than an attempt to cover up his crimes and add more lies, which is exactly this kind of thing. Moreover, Tian Hongnian engaged in public bonds in Yuansheng. If he won, he would take the money out. If he lost, he would leave it there. Although it is now said to be a loss, how much has accumulated and gone away still needs to be investigated. Also, in the names of various accounts, such as Pinji, etc., he made for others, taking a share of the profits as the price of bearing responsibility. There is no way to know clearly. Shi Zian is extremely clever and accustomed to stealing while guarding. If he said that he was involved in the lawsuit by others, I would become a rich man on my own. Judging from his behavior, he seems to have the determination to endure torture and deny it. This phrase "intending to obtain illegal benefits for oneself or a third party" in the law is truly thorough. Who is the third party? From Shi Zian's point of view, it is Tian Hongnian. From Tian Hongnian's point of view, it is Shi Zian. The traces of the two helping each other to make profits and colluding with each other have been consistent from the beginning and have not changed. Although their accounts are intertwined, Tian does not admit that the losses are so huge. This is the constant state of these people devouring each other for profit, which is not surprising. In short, when Shi and Tian brewed their crimes, one was the general manager of Yuansheng and the other was the manager of the China Exchange Bank. Both had the power to do evil easily. As the facts show, they committed crimes and offenses, using the power they possessed to the fullest extent. If such cunning and illegal people commit crimes such as embezzlement, breach of trust, and fraud, and if the harm suffered by their peers is so clear, and if the law does not provide adequate relief, and if the offenders are not punished with the applicable criminal articles, it will be seen that honest and honest merchants in Shanghai will no longer have a foothold in the future. The belief that society looks up to the court as a refuge will also be shaken. People like Yu Shouzheng run their businesses with a purely old-fashioned style, with credit as their second life. In order to preserve credit, they will not hesitate to go bankrupt. In the common business practices, 150,000 yuan should be returned to the China Exchange Bank, and it can be done by opening the books. However, Yu and others did not want to do this. Shi and Tian dared to use the China Exchange Bank to threaten Yu and others, forcing them to repay the expenses of failed speculation with their own hard-earned money. They were simply taking advantage of Yu and others' integrity, morality, and various good qualities to achieve unspeakable motives. Recently, customs have become lax, and human morality has deteriorated. The situation is even worse in the Shanghai foreign concession. Those who have a heart are truly worried. The aforementioned good qualities are extremely easy to destroy, but extremely difficult to cultivate. It is fortunate that there are still merchants like Yu who follow their duties and are diligent. It cannot be said that it is not difficult and commendable. If the law cannot protect them, so that the place where good people do good deeds becomes a stepping stone for evil people to commit crimes, and the crimes committed by them make the good-doers feel discouraged and unwilling to do more, or even if they intend to do so, they are too exhausted to start. Specifically, the word joint liability for future partnerships will become an empty word in the legal dictionary, with no facts to corroborate it. What will be the impact of this on people's hearts, customs, industry, and all other industries? This lawyer is secretly afraid of this, so he dares to state his humble opinions in detail, providing them to the presiding judge for reference. Recently, there is a bad trend in Shanghai, where civil cases are used to falsely accuse criminal lawsuits as a means of intimidation and extortion. This lawyer secretly disapproves of this. However, if it is clearly a criminal case, and it is deliberately placed in the ranks of civil cases in order to gain fame and reputation, this kind of overcorrection is also something that this lawyer does not agree with. Excessive is as bad as inadequate and does not serve the purpose. It is necessary to follow the name and demand the reality, and only be correct. The fact that this case belongs to criminal affairs and is a case with conclusive evidence is undoubtedly beyond doubt. I propose that your court punish Shi Zian and Tian Hongnian according to the seriousness of the case as a warning to the cunning and illegal. Song Fuchen colluded in fraud and the circumstances were lighter. What crime should he be charged with? Your court will certainly have the power to weigh it. This lawyer does not dare to presume to ask. As for the incidental civil lawsuit, I also ask that Shi and others be held fully responsible, that Yu Shouzheng and others'代偿debts and the remaining outstanding debts of Yuansheng Shop be paid in full with interest, and that all litigation costs be borne by the defendants. This is truly beneficial for both public and private morality.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Fire in Jiangwan Yesterday <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Many Firefighters Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (23rd) at around 1 AM, a fire broke out at Zhang Fugen's circle-making shop at the corner of the main lane in Beilong Lane, Jiangwan Town, spreading to neighboring houses. The fire was fierce. The fire brigade in the area, after hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene under the command of captain Zhao Genxiang. At that time, the roads in the area were still covered with rubble after the war and had not been leveled. The electric lights had not been reconnected. In the dark of the night, the team members fell one after another. Gu Zhifa bravely climbed onto the roof and tried his best to put out the fire. After being injured, he was still able to work while injured until the fire was extinguished at dawn. His enthusiasm is truly commendable. It is understood that the fire brigade originally had one large and one small fire truck, but they were completely destroyed after the war. Fortunately, there was a sea ladder that could be connected this time, and the house was dismantled by manpower, so the fire was extinguished. However, eight city houses have been burned down. Otherwise, the spread would have been unimaginable. We hope that the authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Woman Accuses Husband of Bigamy <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Defendant Failed to Appear in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Court Orders Plaintiff to Summon</p>
<p>Ding Hexue, a woman from Fengxian County, Pudong, is now 31 years old. She recently retained lawyer Zhu Honglie to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against her husband, Xu Zushen, for bigamy with a woman named Fei Xuehua. The complaint stated that Ding and Xu were formally married in October of the 11th year of the Republic of China according to the lunar calendar, and it has been ten years. Their feelings have never been compatible, because Xu went to study in Peiping after the marriage and never returned home, so that there have been no children to this day. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, after Xu came south from Peiping, he lived in Shanghai, occasionally returning home, but always received a cold shoulder and harsh words. Therefore, they only bear the empty name of husband and wife. Xu actually intensified his efforts, and on the 28th day of the third month of the lunar calendar last year, he brought Fei and her two daughters home, as if they were husband and wife, and regarded the plaintiff as a stranger. Such a break in love is too difficult to bear. After repeated investigations, it was discovered that the defendants had formally married in Jinglin Hall on Kunshan Road in Shanghai in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China, and even dared to hold a large banquet to invite relatives and friends to celebrate. The only person who was deceived was the plaintiff. Therefore, she came to the court to file a lawsuit, requesting a summons to be issued to punish them according to law, and incidentally filed a civil lawsuit, ordering Xu to pay alimony of 10,800 yuan at one time (30 yuan per month, calculated for 30 years), as well as 5,000 yuan for dowry and compensation for losses. The court approved the complaint and ordered a summons to be issued. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan came to court to gather information. The defendants Xu Zushen and Fei Xuehua did not arrive. The Chinese police reported that they went to Cuichang Pawnshop on North Henan Road to serve the summons to the two defendants, but there was no Cuichang Pawnshop there, so they were unable to deliver the summons. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Zhu, then stated that according to Article 339 of the Criminal Procedure Law, spouses may not file a complaint themselves, so he requested that the police station be instructed to file a joint complaint. Judge Qiao said that according to the agreement, the court did not have this authority. Then he briefly questioned the plaintiff Ding Hexue. Ding was fat, her appearance was not bad, she had short hair and was dressed in modern fashion. She said that the two defendants used to live in Pudong and now live in Cuichang Pawnshop on Baker Road. Judge Qiao verified the confession and instructed that the case be postponed for seven days, waiting for the plaintiff to summon the defendants to court for verification.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 2 PM, Sergeant Li Xianglong of the Second Squad of the Zhabei Police Brigade led twelve policemen on patrol from Chuanqiong Road to North Sichuan Road. When they passed near the Odeon Theater, about seventy or eighty Japanese soldiers suddenly appeared on two trucks, patrolling on the road. When they saw the policemen coming, they surrounded them. In addition to wanting to confiscate the firearms, they also wanted to escort the twelve policemen to the Japanese headquarters. The policemen firmly refused. They immediately called the Second Precinct of the Fifth District to send an inspector to negotiate with the Japanese side. The firearms were not confiscated, but Sergeant Li was taken to the Japanese headquarters. He was released at around 4 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Rent Reduction Movement Update Yesterday <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Gonghe Road Zhen'an Lane on Gonghe Road in Zhabei has more than 300 buildings, close to the railway and in a dangerous war zone. Because the landlord, Kunji Company, did not show any consideration, they took the opportunity to issue a notice when the tenants were returning one after another, collecting rent "from May." Not only could the rent during the war (February, March, April, and May, four months) not be completely waived, but all old debts had to be paid as usual, and there was no reduction in the new rent. Otherwise, they would have to transfer the lease. The tenants could not afford to bear it after surviving the disaster. Therefore, they were represented by Liu Wenbin, Liu Hongdao, and Wu Gongtui to appeal to the Social Affairs Bureau's Municipal Rent Reduction Movement Committee and the Shanghai Tenants' General Federation, asking for help. Lawyers Huang Xiubo and others, entrusted by the Rent Reduction Committee and this association, sent warning letters, but the company ignored them and continued to force the collection of rent with the police. The representative Liu Hongdao and others immediately sought the consent of all the tenants in the lane and established a preparatory committee for the Tenants' Union at No. 120 in this lane yesterday. Liu Wenbin, Zhang Minxian, Liu Hongdao, Zhao Fulin, Wu Gongtui, Han Guifu, Cheng Guoan, Cheng Dasan, Wu Yingxing, Gu Jieran, He Yucai, Dai Minghua, and Xu Shentai and other thirteen people were appointed as executive committee members. The personnel for the supervisory, alternate, and secretary positions were also largely determined. The following resolutions were made regarding the progress of the rent reduction issue: (1) Measures (1) Postpone the payment of old debts, (2) Waive all rent during the war (February, March, April, and May, four months), (3) Pay 50% from June to the end of the year, (2) Request the Rent Reduction Movement Committee to mediate, (3) Hold an inaugural meeting on a regular basis and invite members from the Rent Reduction Committee, the Tenant's General Federation, and the Commercial Federation to provide guidance, (4) Before the Municipal Government's Rent Reduction Measures are announced, all rents will be paid slowly. The method of depositing the rent in the bank will be discussed at the inaugural meeting.</p>
<p>Chengren Lane  Chengren Lane at the corner of Zhongxing Road and Datong Road in Zhabei has dozens of city houses, which are the property of Chengren Company. The rental accountant is urging tenants to pay the rent owed before the war, and also demanding that each room pay an additional two yuan for water because the tenants use too much water. The tenants convened a meeting of all tenants at around 9 AM yesterday to discuss the matter. First, the tenants reported the above-mentioned losses and their difficult circumstances, and requested the landlord to waive the rent for February, March, April, and May (four months), and to reduce the monthly rent by 30% from June to the end of the year. However, the landlord's representative, Shangguan Rong, believed that it was reasonable to waive the rent for February, March, April, and May (four months), but could not agree to the 30% rent reduction and had to ask the landlord for instructions. Next, they discussed adding two yuan per month for water to each room. In the end, the mediation determined that the tenants' water consumption should be calculated at 10% of the rent. For example, a 10-yuan rent can only use one yuan of water per month, and a 20-yuan rent can use two yuan of water. The rest can be deduced by analogy. If this limit is exceeded, the excess water fee should be shared by the tenants. As a result, all the tenants did not agree because the packaged water system did not have this method. The meeting ended without a result.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Respectfully, I have just read your newspaper's report on the "Japanese Manufacturing Morphine Case" and I am extremely shocked. According to this pharmacy, it was established in the 15th year of the Republic by doctors and well-known figures in the business community who invested together. It is entirely a company with the nature that its business objectives are in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Health for the management of Western medicine enterprises, and there are absolutely no transgressions. As for Ye Junqinghe, he is only one of the shareholders of this company, and his individual actions have nothing to do with this company. Moreover, although Ye Jun was falsely accused of being a suspect, he was also questioned by the First and Second Courts of the Shanghai Special District. As a result, the false accusation was found to be unsubstantiated, and he was released on bail pending further evidence. Looking at the above points, it can be seen that this case has nothing to do with this company. We are afraid that people from all walks of life will not understand the truth and that misunderstandings will lead to a significant impact on the company's reputation, so we have specially sent this letter to you, hoping that you will correct it as soon as possible. We would be most grateful. Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>To the Editor, In yesterday's local news in your newspaper, it was reported that a young man named Lu Zhongyi committed suicide by poison in the Shanghai Hotel, leaving behind a photo with the words "Nantong Jiangsu Bank Communications Office" written on the back. Today's follow-up news stated that the deceased was Li Zhongyi, etc. After investigation, there is no such person in our Nantong branch. It is unknown whether the deceased has any relatives or friends among the employees of our bank. In addition to sending a letter to our bank for investigation, we also request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to avoid inaccurate rumors. Yours sincerely, General Administration Office of Jiangsu Bank, June 23.</p>

<p>— Lu Gui Liang</p>
<p>The planes are rumbling, the cannons are booming, people are panicking, and the refugees are thronging. This was the actual state of Songjiang society in early February. I, together with gentlemen from my hometown, gathered to discuss, raised donations separately, contacted Shen, accommodated and set up places. Thanks to everyone's efforts, we succeeded. The refugees received numbered from dozens to hundreds to over two thousand. The donations raised went from dozens to hundreds to over six thousand. As there were many refugees, the house was small and difficult to accommodate, so there were one place, two places, and three places. Their earnest willingness to contribute their talents, money, rice, meat and vegetarian food, clothing, and other miscellaneous items to the association was evident. In terms of groups, there were the business community, academia, the political world, the military world, and the police world. In terms of the general public, there were the old, the young, men, women, converts to Buddhism, and believers in Catholicism and Christianity. Everyone contributed their mental strength, financial resources, eloquence, and talents. They responded to each other and moved in the same direction, unanimously agreeing and helping each other. The hearts of the people of Songjiang can be said to be united. Is there any other effect? It is because the violent Japanese are invading, and disaster will come at any time. Fellow countrymen are suffering, and their pain is related to us. It is all rooted in the conscience of loving others and originates from the innate goodness of human nature, and it cannot be helped. However, I deeply feel that this time, the Japanese invaders did not reach Songjiang, but those received in the institute were mostly from eastern Zhejiang, northern Jiangsu (workers in yarn factories), Baoshan and Jiading in Suzhou, and the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas of Shanghai (business and agricultural circles). The relief association operated and arranged for only one hundred and one days, and only more than four thousand eight hundred yuan were used. There was enough manpower, and the warehouse had enough money. It can be said to be fortunate in misfortune. Today, there is no guiding principle at the top and no law to follow at the bottom. Internal worries arise one after another, and foreign troubles occur frequently. Looking around in horror, I am quietly worried. If all my colleagues in the community can be honest with themselves and love others, endure hardship and fulfill their responsibilities, use their enthusiasm to help those in need, spend their surplus wealth to help the poor, broaden their horizons, and help each other regardless of regional boundaries, then even if there are disturbances from party bandits, rampant petty people, and all kinds of incredible changes, we will have the strength to deal with them, and the disaster can be slightly reduced. What do you think of this, gentlemen of virtue?</p>

<h3 id="e210">New Wireless Radio (Continued) <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Zheng</p>
<p>Speaking of the inside of it, because the new radio puts various components together, it is very complicated, but most of them are tightly placed, saving a lot of space. However, the positions of each component have been precisely designed by radio engineers, and they are not arbitrarily piled up inside. As for the structure of the coil, the sufficient gap between each component, and the correct distance, they were all carefully considered in the design beforehand. Therefore, the difficulties caused by magneto-electric cooperation and electrostatic cooperation have also been reduced, and various noisy sounds have also been changed. As for the speaker (or amplifier), the latest radio uses a new type of dynamic amplifier, which emits clear and loud tones, which cannot be compared with old-fashioned speakers. It is also placed inside.</p>
<p>The convenience of the new radio lies in the use of alternating current. The reason why it can use alternating current has to be attributed to a new invention of vacuum tubes. It uses low-voltage alternating current to supply the burning of the filament. However, there is also a type of battery vacuum tube. Although low-voltage alternating current can make the filament glow red, it does not generate any effect. It must be directly connected to a device that converts alternating current into direct current (this device is called a B-type rectifier) before supplying the filament. Almost all new radios on the market now use alternating current vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>Science is an ever-changing and progressing field, and wireless electricity is advancing even more rapidly. In other countries, new radios have long been available in every household, enjoying the knowledge and entertainment provided by wireless electricity. In the United States, it is even more developed. There are now seven or eight companies broadcasting wireless movies (Television). This type of radio that can only listen and not watch has long become a thing of the past. Therefore, foreign manufacturers transport them to our country, which only knows how to enjoy and does not know how to manufacture them, for special sales. Although its price has dropped a lot since this year, we are still handing over hundreds of yuan to foreigners with both hands when we buy a radio. The outflow of money is truly heartbreaking. I hope that manufacturers in our country will quickly imitate it and recover our rights and interests (end).</p>

<p>— Yi Yong</p>
<p>Miss ×× committed suicide by jumping into the river because her spinsterhood ideals were not achieved! This news spread throughout our M village.</p>
<p>The fact is this: Miss ×× was betrothed by her parents to a farming family in the same village since she was a child. Recently, Miss ××'s husband's family proposed to get married, and the auspicious day had been chosen. Unexpectedly, Miss ×× committed suicide a week before she was about to get married, leaving a suicide note stating that she vowed not to marry anyone, and that she had no choice but to take this measure because her parents did not allow it. When her parents were busily preparing her dowry, they discovered this news and fainted again and again with grief.</p>
<p>A few days later, my little sister and I went to Shen for something. Suddenly, we saw Miss ×× wearing a fashionable outfit, and also with a Western-dressed young man, arm in arm, talking and laughing as they stepped into the ×× movie theater. I was confused at the time. Driven by curiosity, I secretly followed them closely.</p>
<p>"I pretended to jump into the river for you, I voluntarily alienated my parents for you, I risked the bad name of being unfilial for you, I for you..." Miss ×× said, leaning her head a little on the young man's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Oh my Dearest, I know everything. You sacrificed everything for me, and of course I am willing to sacrifice everything for you. Let's leave Shanghai quickly tomorrow. After a month, we can live together to consummate our love," the Western-dressed young man said softly, stroking Miss ××'s fingers.</p>
<p>After listening to their conversation, I finally woke up from a dream and suddenly realized. But my little sister pulled my hand and insisted that I leave quickly, so I silently walked to the place we wanted to go.</p>
<p>A Small and Strange Thing</p>
<h3 id="e212">Tangbing Feast <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>My friend Lao Wang had a son, and yesterday he sent me an invitation and a box of red eggs, eight of them. The invitation read:</p>
<p>"I respectfully choose ×month ×day as the day for the full moon of my young son ××. I will respectfully prepare Tangbing (noodles served at a baby's first month party). I respectfully invite your whole family to come!" Underneath was "×× bows" and "The banquet will be held at ×× Restaurant."</p>
<p>I don't understand, why does he want to invite people to drink when his child is born? If it's for celebration, then what is being celebrated? If it's for "adding a male heir," it's still a question of whether adding a male heir is a good thing. Moreover, most of the common people who are happy to have children are made into cannon fodder or fill the ditches. In the past twenty years, due to natural disasters and man-made disasters, the population has lost an unknown amount. The soldiers sacrificed in the Battle of Longhai are enough to build a small country. If it is said to be "both wealth and offspring flourishing" and "celebration for the family," then how do you know that this child will definitely seek welfare for the country and become a great man for society in the future? Maybe he will degenerate or betray the country and become a traitorous businessman and be scolded by future generations? Therefore, even if you want to celebrate, it should be on the day of "success and fame," and definitely not on the day of the full moon. Furthermore, if you want to take this opportunity to have a drink with a few friends, then a "potluck" is fine, why use the child as a topic? I send gifts, and you host a banquet, which is not economical for both of us, and only benefits the silver shop and the liquor store? It is better to use the banquet fee for the Tangbing party to cultivate yourself and other children, then wouldn't the future celebration be more reliable? In short, I can't find the ultimate thing worth celebrating in this matter, or the reason why I should be invited to drink. If there is, there is one more decorative item, a toy, in the family. Like adding a gramophone or a talking parrot, it is a pastime for the father and grandparents. Another meaning is to take this opportunity to "show off" in front of friends. In short, it has nothing to do with the ignorant child. This is a game for wealthy adults.</p>
<p>Treating children as decorative items like potted plants in the family, or toys like pet cats and dogs, is terrible for the children. If I were a child, I would protest.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Lessons from Watching a Slapstick Play <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— He Zhou</p>
<p>The ×× slapstick troupe was performing at the ×× theater. A friend came to pull me to see it. To relieve the boredom of my spare time, I finally stepped into the entertainment arena, which I hadn't set foot in for five months.</p>
<p>The name of the play was "The First Bridge in the World," which was a cameo performance of juggling. It was the so-called "360 lines of business." Of course, what the actors on stage were performing made people unable to help but laugh. In particular, the wit of the dialogue gave me a profound hint. Although what they said was all in "slapstick" tone, it was not just for people to "laugh." It also contained a teaching meaning.</p>
<p>The stage was set like this: A beggar was singing loudly. A passerby saw him and said with a cold taunt and disgusted tone, "Poor beggar! You're so poor, and you still want to be so happy!"</p>
<p>The beggar heard this and retorted, "Don't look down on the poor in a condescending way. Maybe you will end up like me in the future."</p>
<p>The passerby glared at the beggar for a while and then said proudly, "Bah! I have fine clothes and good food, money and power. How can I be poor?"</p>
<p>"Hum! Your current position is exactly my past life." The beggar said in a frivolous tone, calmly and with emotion, "Hehe! Let me tell you, I used to be even more prominent than you! But it's the second time I've become a beggar."</p>
<p>The beggar then said in a regretful tone, "I was originally a poor beggar. Later, I was pitied and taken in by someone, and I slowly improved. Before long, I was able to stand on my own. So I married a wife and bought a house, and everything went smoothly. I earned some money and started speculating in business. As a result, I luckily won. At this time, it was no longer the same. I built a Western-style house, bought a car, and took in beautiful concubines, doing everything one by one. I looked down on all my old poor friends. It's just like you looking down on me now. I saw those dignitaries and nobles and flattered them a lot, because I felt that with them, I would have a backer and could do anything recklessly. At that time, I had a considerable reputation. Occasionally, I did a sloppy event, and no one could do anything to me. I was really carefree, eating, drinking, and hanging out all day long. There was no day that I didn't go to dance halls and gambling dens. I spent all day living the life of a 'big boss.' Who knew that the affairs of the world could not escape the fixed rule of circulation. I was in 'wealth' and only circled half a circle. After all, money is limited, and fate is limited. Later, because I did a bribery affair, I was accused. So I ate lawsuits. Eating lawsuits depends on whether you have a wide range of connections. The other party was better than me, and I was already in the wrong. In the end, I was imprisoned, my family property was confiscated, my reputation was ruined, and I had nowhere to go. Thinking about it, it was as if I had taken a bath in society. In the end, I still ended up like this, returning to my original appearance and still living as a beggar... So you are now complacent and arrogant, which is really unconscious." After the beggar finished speaking, he gave a sinister laugh.</p>
<p>"..." The passerby thought for a while and then said with enlightenment, "The rich should not look down on the poor, and the poor should not be jealous of the rich."</p>
<p>A word led me, sitting under the stage, to sigh secretly.</p>
