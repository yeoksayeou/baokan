<h3 id="c1">土耳其成立三年計劃 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>貧窮混亂積弱不振之土耳其自從一九二三年正式宣告結束帝制政府之命運。並樹立民主政權而後。即漸以步入新興之坦途。迨其後對外廢除不平等條約。對内厲行建設。整頓敎育。而國力乃日張。儼然爲近東之新興强國。最近步武蘇聯之五年計劃。成立一三年計劃。土總理伊斯默及外長魯希蒂游蘇。且對蘇成立八百萬美金之借欵。大部分用於財政及工業計劃。欲藉以發展紡織業農業及機器工業。同時二國間之關係。亦以土總理此行而獲得更進一步之提携。即如關於文化之溝通。雙方都主張採用更直接之方法科學機關都互相聯絡。視士邇年之勵精圖治。朝氣蓬勃。吾人蓋可斷言其三年計劃。必能收穫良好之效果。同時土蘇之互相提携。必能使兩國共蒙其益收得唇齒相依之助。</p>
<p>吾人於土之成立三年計劃。輒興起數種國觸。其一。土在革命之先。其國家之混亂與貧弱。蓋無不與我國相類似。其苦於帝國主義者之侵略。與不平等條約之束縛。我國之處境亦無不同。然而彼長淪於貧弱混亂黑暗下之民族。一旦覺醒即奮然而起。内而摧毁專制黑暗之蘇丹統治。樹立革命之民主政權。外而擺脫帝國主義者之宰制。致國家於平等自由。更與希臘侵略之强軍苦戰三年持久抗禦不屈不撓而國終以復興。民族終以覓得其其新生命。即列强對彼。亦不得不刮目相看。我國則如何。内政日紊。外侮日亟。以視土耳其之復興。我國不當亟醒沉沉之酣夢。努力於我民族之新生耶。</p>
<p>次之。吾人前於「無計劃的國家與有計劃的國家」一評中。曾已說明一國之政治。如一架整個之機器。機器必其構造健。全而後其運用乃得靈活無礙。政治亦必依賴於政府組織之健全。一切在有計劃之狀態下同時並進。而後其進行乃得遵循軌道。不至浪費精力。更不至叢生弊端。土耳其政治。已漸步入正軌。故其利用外資。以進行三年計劃。必得收穫良好之果實。抑計劃爲一切事實成功之始基。個人之行動。應有計劃。一國之政治經濟。更應有整個之計劃。我國今日則一切毫無計劃。即其有之。亦支離破碎各不相謀。且大抵皆爲空談。初並未計及其實行。即以江蘇建設廳而言其三年建設之劃剛次發表。而江蘇省政府委員乃復以財政因難而全體辭職是則其所謂三年計劃。實上已成畫餅。可以斷言。我國何日得步武蘇聯與土耳其之後籌一整個而切實際有步驟之立國計劃。以奠定我國家之新基耶。</p>

<p>「我們到外面去看看吧。廟裏不大行。」朱先生一面說，一面向大門外走。我說：「廟外再也找不出一個更合式的地方。村莊裏祗是一些茅草棚，怎能做學堂？張鬍子的家裏雖是石庫門，也比古廟小得多，决不合用。」朱先生說：「我們出去看看，總不礙事。鐘兒你不要拘執成見，也許還有更好的地方在那兒等着我們去找咧。」我於是領導朱先生穿村莊裏經過。好熱閙呀！連姑娘，小姐，少奶奶都跑到家門口來看，一個個的爆蠶荳樣說：「那就是先生！」小孩們是三五成羣的像尾巴樣在後面跟着。</p>
<p>我們走到鐵匠舖，李鐵匠放下那通紅的鐵，出來與我們招呼。朱先生笑笑嘻的對我說，」這個舖子就是一個頂好的課堂，李司務便是我們的先生。我們以後要向他請敎咧。」李司務很客氣說，「朱先生不要見笑。我這個粗人，懂得什麽？一定要先生指敎我才對。」</p>
<p>我們别了李司務，遠遠的看見老許在那兒砌牆，朱先生說：「那個砌牆的地方也是我們的一個課堂，磚匠司務也是我們的老師。那司務呌付麽名字？」「那是磚匠老許，反對辦學堂就是他。」我便把他的歷史一五一十的告訴了朱先生。朱先生說：「儘管他反對，我們要學砌牆的道理，總得請敎他。」</p>
<p>再走過去，是一個很大的菜園，趙小二哥正在那兒澆糞水。小二哥種菜是頂有名的菜，又大又嫩而且長得快。村莊裏是没有人比得上他。朱先生說：「趙家菜園也是我們的一個課堂。小老二便是敎我們種菜的先生。」</p>
<p>離菜園半里路是一座山，遍山是松樹，呌做萬松嶺。萬松嶺上有一顆老松樹，老松樹上有一隻老鷹在那兒做窠。朱先生問，「這顆老松樹是什麽？那老鷹又是誰？」我毫不遲疑的而且十分自信的回答說：「這顆老松樹是我們的一個課堂。那老鷹便是我們的先生。」朱先生說：「聰明的鐘兒·飛鳥是很好的建築工程師，傳說古人造房子便是跟鳥兒學的。我還想問你一句，這裏是我們的課堂，那裏又是我們的課堂，那麽我們的學堂究竟在什麽地方？」我說：「朱先生丨我的學堂全被你打破了。我現在知道你心中的學堂是什麽。你的學堂是以靑天爲頂，大地爲底，二十八宿爲門牆，萬物都是你的先生，都是你的同學，我完全懂了，都是你的學生。你打破了我的烏籠式的小學校而給了我一個森林似的大學校。我們在這海闊天空中過生活，那是多麽的快樂呀！」朱先生說：「聰明的鐘兒，你是知道了一半！」</p>

<p>（二）治本　談到戰區内敎育事業的百年大計、我們不得不回憶歐戰時各國敎育狀况、作我們一個當頭棒喝、查當德國四面楚歌經濟在羅雀掘鼠時、他們於一九一六年再提出大宗欵項、施行「統一學校」制度、津貼貧寒子弟升學、並於一九一八年發起平民大學、培養没金錢没時間的靑年勞衝者、美國參戰後、敎育事業益轉活動、敎師薪金、且復大增、一九一七年國會通過司密斯許士案、撥國庫鉅欵補助職敎育、一九一八年國會又通過司密斯杜男議案提出國庫金一萬萬元補助公民鄉村等敎育、他若英·法·比·各國在戎馬倥偬之際、竭力維持敎育、軍費雖浩繁、而敎育經費却有增無减、戰後更大事擴充、這皆因他們有基金有的欵、更有監理董事會或特别會計委員會、法律爲之保障、無論政治上軍事上發生重大變動、敎育欵項不許挪做别用、我們應仿照此辦法、敎育事業才能上軌道、才有蒸蒸日上的希望、這是治本的一大要點、市小學校此後應建築優良的校舍、考過去的閘北十二所市立小學、没有一校自有房屋、没有一校具備適當的操塲、這種畸形敎育、原自沿革而致、乘此機會、該急起直追、遴選相當地段、購地建築、切實的做悉事業、又宜添設中等學校、以惠市民、私立的明强中學和晏摩氏女學、建築偉大、地點可取、現聞停辦、深爲忱惜、市府若能商購辦理中學、再好也没有了、將來戰區敎育、公立學校爲經私立學校爲緯、故私立學校地位、也很重要、小規模的私校、能合二三校併辦、最爲上策、經費旣省、效率又高、同是栽培國民、當無畛域之分、想大家爲的吧原氣未喪的範圍大的私校、嗣後應健全組織、充實内容、提高程度、因舊增廣、比較事順而易成、社會敎育機關、望公私協力推廣、鑒於這次漢奸的衆多、將來補習學校民衆學校民衆敎育館平民圖書館該多多　辦、至於經濟問題、容後面討論、</p>
<p>上面提及的政府中央與地方都包含在内、因爲有的事、地方政府擔當不了、扙擔當不好、非有中央政府的襄助不行、同時尤盼辦學者和地方居民與政府通力合作、才能收得事半功倍之效、聞被災中等校將派代表赴京請願、市敎育界救國聯合會將呈請敎育部救濟淞滬戰區學校、關於這點、記者倒有二個意見、（一）對於敎育界團體、他們應站在一起、聯合組織一個「上海市戰區文化復興委員會」、由被災文化機關及其他敎育團體推舉代表組織之、熱心敎育人士、當然亦所歡迎加入、這委會的最重要的工作如調查實况、擬具具體辦法、籌募經濟并貢獻意見於政府、（二）政府休待民衆的請求還没一定主張、該事先憑靠實况、宣佈補救辦法、同濟大學·勞働大學·曁南大學·中國公學·中央醫學商學院·上海法學院·商船學校等等損失極大、中央究竟預備如何經營、對普通私校到底怎樣津貼扶助恢復、期望日内有好消息頒下、</p>
<p>亦爲諸君子之所熟知、今茲泛論及此、尙望諸君子共認今日爲敎育事業之轉換時期、相與力矯過去之錯誤、而努力創造敎育之新生命、是則不佞所馨香禱祝以求者也、</p>
<p>目前蘇省財政竭蹶、敎育經費、積欠甚鉅、以致敎職員之生活、咸感不安、而服務之熱心、容或不免爲之中餒、而尤以地方小學爲甚、敎育生活、三極艱苦、充其所入、僅足敷事畜之資、今並此亦不能獲、揆諸常理、豈得謂平、抑知頻年天災人禍、重疊相加、國家財政、爲之枯竭已成全國普遍之現象、固不僅蘇省爲然、而社會經濟破産、公務人員生活之痛苦、大致相同、又不僅敎育界如此也、且敎育事業、非其他可比、方今强敵侵凌、國難日亟、遠東大戰、迫在眉睫、人爲刀爼、我爲魚肉、興廢存滅、間不容髮、欲言自救、則政治之修明、旣非一日可期、而經濟之發展、更非一蹴可企、所恃以挽救國命於萬一者、獨此一線生機之敎育、苟吾人不於此日、一奮犧牲之精神、力排萬難而共相維護、則政治破産、經濟破産、又益以敎育破産、是惟有坐視版圓易色、萬衆淪胥、而文化澌滅、且將使整個中華民族、共淪於馬牛蟲豸之域、故知中國存亡之關鍵、一繋於從事敎育者之變肩也、夫貞松不以歲寒而改性、無恒産而有恒心者、惟士爲能、敎育家旣爲社會之先覺、故必於顚沛困苦之中、能樹其堅貞卓絶之節、斯足以顯示敎育家之眞精神、試觀歐戰以後、德國經濟、已陷於絶滅之深淵、大學敎授之生活、尙不啻平時之苦工、履穿旣無資再購、襪敝則截衫自綴、亘一月之久、尙不得一度肉食、然其研鑽訓育、並未嘗因此而廢、故德國之文化、雖經百戰瘡痍之後、未嘗或衰、不數載遂完成復興之大業、吾國敎育家舍身救國之志、寗復後人、當不讓德意志專美於前也今日敎育之中落、固原於政治之未入正軌、而政治之紛亂、復原於敎育之未臻完善、二者遞爲因果、自不可執二端而論、然則吾人詎能諉於政治之不良、遂棄自身之職責於不顧耶、不佞旣職司行政、故於地方敎費之整理、省經費之穏定、亦曾殫精竭慮勉盡棉薄、此當爲諸君之所共見、今後在職一日、自當竭一日之力、以盡其應盡之責、凡足以解除敎職員諸君之痛苦者、亦無不就事實之可能、謀確切之效果、固不願以口惠之漫言自飾、更不敢以片面之義務責人也、即在政府同仁、亦認敎育爲救亡之道、立國之本、凡百皆可省可緩、惟敎育經費、則無不積極籌措、徒以經濟事實所限、致未能盡如所期、此則事之無可如何而當爲諸君子之所共諒者也、</p>
<p>要之、今日救亡之道理惟在敎育、而振興敎育之道、又在司政與掌敎者、能各認清其本身之責任、互爲精誠之聯合、念國步之艱危、抱殉職之决心、勿存推諉、勿任中餒竭忠盡智、分途邁進、任何困難、必須克服、任何苦艱、必須忍受、則吾國敎育、庶幾可望復興矣、</p>
<p>不佞雖備員政府、自審未異書生、官樣文章、素所不取、凡茲所言、容或近於凡庸、要亦出於至誠之所激發、尙望諸君子鑒於過去敎育之覆轍、而改絃更張、懍於敎育爲吾國唯一救亡之道、而舍身盡職、則蘇省幸甚、中國幸甚、（完）</p>

<p>盛京號遇險</p>
<p>在威海衛遇霧擱礁</p>
<p>船頭兩洞海水冲入</p>
<p>船員旅客完全救出</p>
<p>公司派輪速往拖救</p>
<p>英商太古公司北洋班輪新盛京號、此次由滬赴津、突在威海衛附近、遇霧觸礁、船身損壞、旅客救起、詳情如下、</p>
<p>由滬開津　太古公司北洋一路原有正班客輪通州·奉天·順天·等三艘、往來滬津間、去年以三船年齡較舊、燃煤過耗、遂由香港本廠、添建新輪一艘、定名盛京、今年三月二日、從上海開處女班赴津、迄今共祇行駛九趙、上星期六上午十時、由滬運載貨客赴津、途次威海衛附近、海面發生大霧、該輪遂遭擱礁、</p>
<p>遇霧擱礁　新盛京輪於十二日晚、開到山東成山角嘴、海面已發生大霧、該處暗礁最多、航行最難、招商局新大新昌·新康·等輪、均在該處失事沉没、新盛京到此地、亦由船主李德希氏、改開慢車、至八時半、船抵清明島、Chiming　Island該地距威海衛之東、僅十五海哩、霧露益大、航道亦爲蔽没、遂觸入清明島暗礁石上、船體擱住、不能移動、船頭兩旁、</p>
<p>亦被撞破兩個大洞、海水冲進輪内、船身發生危險、</p>
<p>船主求援　盛京輪失事後、船主李德希氏、立即發出求救無綫電訊號、首先得到消息者、爲劉公島英國海軍軍艦、當經英海軍提督、急派驅逐艦華倫Ｗaen及克披爾Keppel號兩艘、並海軍提督之拖駁一艘、駛往清明島、救護盛京輪中旅客、</p>
<p>旅客脫險　盛京輪在滬赴津、共乘有旅客三百五十名、内西人四十名、華人三百十名、當擱礁後、全輪乘客、均逃集艙面、解放舢舨及救命衣等、冀圖逃生、迨兩英艦趕到、始由海軍拖駁、將船中西人三十五人、華人一百八十七人、駁救到華倫艦中、先送赴威海衛上陸、另有中國旅客一部、尙在救護中、其船員等二十六人、則由克披爾號艦救起、亦送赴威埠、</p>
<p>行李起出　昨日上午七時半、滬上總公司始接到盛京失事之電、僅言船身觸礁、旅客安全、嗣經該公司去電詢問原因、下午始得復電、謂全部旅客均救到威埠、各人行李物件、亦已全行駁載到威海衛、所有郵件等項、聞亦卸出、可無損失、</p>
<p>保護載客　昨日該公司已急電在華北途中奉天輪、速往威海衛、裝載救起被難旅客、送往天津、又以盛京輪中在滬裝載貨物頗多、内以疋頭茶葉居大宗、今船遭觸礁、一時未即脫險、故商准英國海軍、派驅逐艦一艘、停泊該處保護、</p>
<p>拖救船身　盛京輪頭艙、已有兩洞、海水浸没艙中、故頭艙之貨、已受水潰、損失頗重、惟船身擱在礁上、須候潮漲時、方能將其拖出、昨日該公司辦理營救事宜、異常忙碌、並派寗波號輪船、今日由滬開往出事地點、辦理拖救等工作、</p>
<p>輪體概况　盛京輪係去年新建、今歲二月内出塢來滬、方始開行第九次、此船搆造甚佳、凈長三百英尺、闊四十六英尺、載重三千噸、船身造價及各艙等、一切布置、值洋一百萬元、爲現時航行北洋之最優最速之輪、</p>
<p>順天受驚　今次順天輪、由津來滬、經過成山角嘴海面、亦受重大危險、據該輪船員言、順天到成山角時、係在深夜、而海面亦有大霧、詎有日輪一艘、不拉汽笛、迎面開來、及經發見、祇距十餘丈、兩輪同走一直綫内、順天船主大驚、急打倒車、徼倖動作捷快、得以避過苟遲一分鐘、兩船便須撞沉、事後、船内激入之海水、抽去不少、至今思之、猶有餘怖也、</p>
<p>路透社十三日威海衛電云、海軍拖船聖白羅克號、今日午後二時、拖一貨船、載苦力人工、往助盛京輪船卸貨、徽州輪船現泊盛京之旁、以待奉天由塘沽開抵、於景聖白羅克號所拖之貨船將由盛京卸貨、運登奉天、而徽州將載盛京之搭客至塘沽、目下天氣尙佳、惟霧仍未散、</p>

<p>李國杰之談話　昨日各報將此項消息刋登後、各記者分趨招商局總經理李國杰處探詢、當由李氏否認、據云、本人接事以來、對局内整理方案、可謂各頭萬緒、三千萬鉅欵、固爲招商局所需要、然以種種關係、在本人接事後、並未進行、報載各節、或係傳聞失實云云、</p>

<p>實行改組罷工委員會</p>
<p>昨晚大會爲捕房阻止</p>

<p>臨時大會　罷工委員會、於前日下午十時、在愛文義路通商旅館、開臨時緊急大會</p>
<p>、議决、（一）部份罷工委員會委員、因工作不力、當即罷免、實行改組、另行推員補充之、總數仍爲二十一人、（二）健全罷工委員會組織、（三）採用有效辦法、向公司再行交涉、（四）全體工人、於十三日晨、在福建路新中央行集合、向公司催促答復、（五）對公司發表告工人書、提出抗議、</p>
<p>催促答復　昨日上午十時、罷工工人、奉令集合於福建路新中央行、向公司催促正式答復條件後、因參加人數寥寥、加以公司並無負責人員、乃停止舉行、改於浙江路再春閣開會、議决、（一）擴大罷工組織、（二）定下午二時、在赫德路舉行全體工人大會、徵求工人意見、再行决定進行方針、</p>
<p>嚴守紀律　自公司告工人書發表後、罷工委員會、昨晨特佈告各工友云、爲佈告事、現我方所提出條件、資方態度、異常强硬、顯已决裂、惟有繼續罷工之必要、凡我工友、一律不准上工、奉守紀律、如有私自破壞、本法庭依法處罰、决不曉恕、此致各工友們、罷工委員會法院秘書處、（附罷工紀律如下、（一）没有罷工委員會命令、任何人不得私自上工、（二）不是罷委所派代表、在何人得向資方交涉談判、（三）服從罷委會的指揮、和命令、如有破壞上列紀律者、即作工賊對付云、</p>
<p>今日抗議　嗣因曁南大學前捕房禁止集會、以致開會未成、乃改開罷工委員會、議决　定今日上午十時、由江西路總公司曁福建路海寗路億定盤路敏體尼蔭路楊樹浦等九處分行、每部推派代表一人、會同罷工委員會主席團代表三人、赴公司向大班提出抗議　、並催促答</p>

<p>間負責代表、將自已確定之會議時間地點、於明日（十四日）上午九時、通知本接洽處朱君、（二）主席團决於明日上午十時向資方提出抗議書、並催促答復條件、希望各行各間、速推代表一人、與主席國派定代表一同出發、各代表必須於明日上午九時、在此集合、（三）糾察委員、務須今日起依照臨時大會命令、執行其職務、</p>
<p>抗議原文　電話工人罷工委員會對於電話公司通告工人書、特提抗議書如下、（一）公司說、「罷工没有預先通知公司」、「公司願討論依公司手續提出之任何問題」、這是欺騙工人、蒙蔽社會的話、去年工人就提出要求十八條交給公司、請求討論答復、公司不理、今年又經工頭呌工人籨字、要求公司增加工資、也無答復、最近又要求恢復被開除工人工作、公司又不理、公司是完全没有把中國工人看在眼裏、不願討論工人的問題、所以工人受了敎訓、無出路可走、不得不用罷工的手段、來對付公司、解决工人的切身問題、所以罷工的責任、公衆便利犧牲的責任、應完全由公司負担、工人是不能担負任何責任、（二）「公司内部整理計劃之進行、」就要取消禮拜工·禮拜日休息·照給工資·禮拜日工作·工資加倍、以前是這樣、什麽「整理計劃、」要取消禮拜日工作工資加倍的規定、公司曁要工人在星期日也來工作、而不加倍給工資、這祗是强迫工作、所謂「整理計劃」祗是加倍進攻工人的計劃、（三）「公司因營業關係、四月份工人薪金不增、」公司「因營業關係、」（注意并不是公司虧了本、而是要大賺錢的營業關保、）可以要電話加價、工人的工資减少、工人也開除、都是「正當」的、工人因爲物價漲了、肚子吃不飽、要求加點工資、就是「不天當」的要求、工人被開除、没有飯吃了、要求發點退職金、也是「無理」要求、這只是强辯、這樣的「正當」和「眞理」、只是壓迫工人的别名、（四）「養老金、儲蓄金、公司没有扣、」但公司開除工人時、總是各種藉口、實際上大多數是扣去了、我們堅决反對以任何藉口扣發工人的儲蓄金等、（五）「公司因進　整理計劃、」「必須開除大批工人、」我們堅决反對公司這種壓迫工人犧牲工人的「整理計劃」我們要求保障工人生活和利益、我們是完全正當的、（六）「罷工是少數不良份子的鼓動、工人是受人愚弄、」這是誣蔑侮辱工人、是分裂工人的毒計、老猪受了壓迫、也要反抗、我們工人、就連老猪都不如了、壓迫我們到不能出氣的時候、也不知道起來反抗了、工人都是阿木林、只會受人愚弄、肚子餓了、都不知道要吃飯、帝國主義的資本家、看中國人比猪還不如啊、三千工人一致罷工、堅持罷工、這是鐵的事實、工人是不會中資本家的毒計的、是一致團結來爭取要求條件的是堅决擁護自己領袖的、是要和資本家拚命到底的、使帝國主義者</p>
<p>不敢輕視中國人、我們爭取本身利益、也要爭點中國民族的尊嚴、公司到今天還是不願和工人討論让三條件、詎絶會見工人的代表、無誠意解决罷工、是罷工延長的責任、影響公衆、便利的責任、應完由公司負担、希望社會各界、一致警告資本家從速答復工人的條件、解决罷工、并給工人以同情和援助、</p>
<p>工頭被毆　在電話工人一致堅持罷工、竟有外工工頭某受資方收實、招集工人、私</p>
<p>自上工、工人十分慣激、因有工人數十人、於昨日傍晚、將其圍毆、致受重傷、聞公司方面、已將該工頭送入醫院、不敢再招工人開工、</p>
<p>告工友書　上海電話公司工人罷工委員會告工友書云　全體工友們、我們爲反對公司開除要求增加工資及退職金而罷工、已有六天了、資本家不但不答復我們的條件、而且開除我們十二個工友、資本家說、我們「罷工没有預先通知公司、」「公司經理樂與工人討論工人的問題、」這是騙人的話、以前我們簽字交給公司、公司是完全不理的、不討論的、所以我們非用罷工來反對資本家不可、資本家是不把我們工人當人的、他預備要餓死我們工人、他不和我們的代表談話、資本家這樣壓迫侮辱我們、還能忍耐嗎、我們要用我們的熱血、和資本家併個死活、罷工委員會號召工友堅持罷工到底、資本家不答應我們的條件、我們誓死不上工、資本家派了工賊走狗、到處於謡言、通知工人上工、工友們、不要聽資本家的謡言、打工賊走狗、罷委主席國内也發現了走狗、昨日主席國會議、翁振華陳澤榮及潘某等、竟提議通過三個議來、（一）只要資本家答應、「承認職工會」及禮拜工二條即可上工、加工資、保障職業及退職金等條都不要了、（二）到國民黨去請願調解、（三）撤消委員葉公興職務、工友們、我們是要堅持、罷工得到勝利的條件才上工、但是主席團忩陳等是要上工、犧牲工友的條件、我們是要罷委的代表向資本家直接交涉解决、因爲郵務報館罷工請人調解的結果、是罷工失敗、條件没有、很多工友被捕、我們不願罷工照郵務報館的一樣、所以反對調解、但他們偏要請國民黨來調解、葉公興當代表、努力爲工友作事、反對葉公興的、只有捕房資本家、逮捕他、但翁陳等他要撤葉公興的職、工友們、這不是工賊走狗的行動嗎、這樣的主席團、能够領導我們罷工得到勝利嗎、絶對而行、所以昨天下午代表大會開緊急會議、一致否認主席團所通過上列决議、並改組了主席團、撤消了翁振華·陳澤榮·及潘某等的一切職務、並重新選舉葉公興等十一人組織主席團、領導工友奮門到底、爭取條件的勝利、新主席團是願意以自己的生命、和頭領爭取罷工勝利的、大家必須服從罷工委員會命令、擁護罷委一致奮門、我們不是閙意氣、因爲舊的主席團要出賣大衆工友、我們要爭取罷工勝利、非驅逐他們不可、驅逐他們、並不會減少我們的力量、反而是使我們團結更鞏固、領導更堅强、工友們團結起來打倒走狗、堅持罷工、勝利是我們的、上海電話公司罷工委員會六月十三日、</p>

<p>報載懲治負汚法草案條文開。凡公務員收受賄賂或不正利益至一千元以上者。處死刑。要求期約或受賄賂在五百元以上未滿千元者。處無期徒刑。又開人務員犯該條之罪。所擬受之賄賂或利益。没收之。若全部或一部不能没收時。追徵其價值等語。此特别法也。别於普通法。即刑法。而特爲計贓科罪之規定。意重懲貪、法重計贓也。惟獄情萬變。立法抽象。殊苦難周。蓋賄賂有超出乎金錢物質之外者。設例。某甲將其妻或女若姊妹。行求贈獻公務員。該員收受。如所行求。而予以違法之任官。或枉法之訟判。事經發覺到官。偵查得實。提付專庭。人類是否賄賂。色藝是否利益。殊耐研究。此公務員犯罪原因。固赫然坐此女人也。如認爲非賄賂。則不適用懲貪法。即在刑法亦不認爲搆成受賄之犯罪。或以凟職科刑。或以行政懲戒。顯係情重罰輕。對於千元槍决五百元永禁之犯。一爲比較。國典不免偏頗。如認爲是賄賂。則本法結晶在計贓。此女人者。旣不是唐律之奴婢。與牛馬同科。又非同慣習之娼妓。有身價可準。於是計贓之術窮。連帶而没收徵償。均無辦法。本法計贓結晶在千元。千元上下。關係先死出入者至重。予百思</p>

<p>償之贓。得爲適當之處分。如此補充。則前設問題。可以解决。顧又有疑問焉。蓋施諸不知情之女人尙可。倘女人知情。是共犯也。且事實多有女爲男謀。造意自女人方面。是女人爲敎唆正犯矣。尤難者。有時男子反不知情。設例。甲乙犯刑事或懲戒處分。在逮訊中。其妻或女。用乙名義。以身行求贈獻公務員。該員收受違法宣告某乙無罪或免議。似此之案。有賄賂。有受賄者、却無行賄者。而法幾窮矣。大抵法律如囊。事實如錐。錐處囊中。其末立見。或眀脫穎而出。欲囊括之無遺也。殆不可能。負立法之責者。其謂之何。在東先生早任法曹。歷膺氏社。法學與經騐並懋。此問題關係立法。非等閒有趣之文也。實有研究之價值。海内專家。如有解答。固吾友所企望。亦本刋所歡迎。但篇欄逼狹。文字不可過長耳。鵑識。</p>

<p>顧亭林曰。國家興亡。匹夫有責。吾則曰。匹婦尤有責焉。屏斥華美之服飾用具。勤儉刻苦以激厲男子。共造成良好之社會風習。培養國家之元氣。保全世界之安寗。非吾女子之責乎。願吾女同胞勿以其爲老生常談而怱視之也。</p>
<p>附識一　近閱西醫王立才君所撰致富錦囊。中述其太高祖母張太宜人節孝事略云。每日紡紗十二兩。得工資五十交。除一姑兩孩四人食用外。尙能積蓄。以還清所負之債。註云。二百年前物價低廉。以一文錢至醬園。可買醬醋油酒各一碗。謂之四盌一文。白米價每升二文而已見戚飯牛所著陸稼書故事云。杰按張宜人節孝事略。始於乾隆二十九年。其時米價已在每升得五十文。常人每日不過紡紗六七兩而已。則普通日力所得。當爲二三十文。故知米價每升爲十數文也。蓋高宗三巡江南。頗喜鋪張。地方多所耗費。社會風習。漸趨奢靡。而物價遂騰高也。陸稼書故事。乃康熙年間事。此足證明聖祖勵行節儉之成效也。然白米一升二文。係指極賤之時。按張文端聰訓齋語康熙三十六年所撰。紀當時白米每石銀四錢。則亦不過每升四五文。蓋田賦旣輕。而其他日用物品概無捐稅。且農得安其業。而工商不爲奢侈之物品。則能使農産物增多。故物價廉而農與商仍有利可圖也。按明末時。百物騰貴。民生艱困。乃不過二三十年。遽能使物價低廉至此。則知物價與政治關係之密切矣。物價低則生活易。而人安樂。物價</p>
<p>昂則生活難而民思亂。故不能使物價低廉生活便易者。謂之政治不良。換言之。即不講民生主義之過也。</p>
<p>。故亦率領所部。整隊游行街市。並赴城中王廢基公共體育塲舉行全團會食。藉此觀俗聯歡。菜雖不甚精美。質皆清潔異常。舉杯起箸。均聽口令。動作畫一。官兵共樂。觀衆莫不贊其軍紀嚴肅。精神親愛。其樂融融。食畢又導往公園游覽。最奇者吳人膽小。素怕軍人。每遇兵士。不稱之曰灰駱駝。即名之曰兵老勇。遠而避之。畏與交接。詎料是日該團兵士往游公園時。園中各界游客之舉動。與平素截然相反。不特靑年男子。咸趨與各兵士暢談淞滬抗日經過情形。即婦孺亦趨至槍架附近。細察希敵之槍砲。並賞鑒名聞全球之箬帽。足徵人民心理。咸以十九路軍之兵士爲國爭人格。爲民除巨憝。確係國之干城。與其他魚肉人民之武人不同。該團游行時。除以軍樂爲前導外。並佐以廣東鑼鼓。甚形熱閙。故觀者如堵。好惡發於人民本性。非强權所能强求。語曰以德服人。乃心悅而誠服。觀此次吳人之對十九路軍而益信。願國内佩虎符者以此爲殷鑒。而整頓其所部。使槍口對外也可。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第十回　權門網紀期凌賴有閨人慰藉　㨗徑苞苴利達命將山盜招安話說安玉田在督軍公署承啓處客廳内靜坐待傳。從下午一點鐘直坐候到五點多鐘。還没曾有承啓官傳喚他上去見葉督軍。也没有通知他說是不見。只讓似似木頭人一般呆坐在那椅子上。動也不能動。走也不能走。只暗暗呌苦。怕要變成個木化石。最後看看有許多幸運兒都隨到隨傳見過督軍走了。天色漸漸昏暗下來。已再没有新上座的人。只剩下外間這客廳中一共還有十來位客。仍一個個愁眉苦臉似泥塑木雕的偶像般在靜候着。盼望那石沈大海的消息。他畢竟年少氣盛</p>
<p>。不比旁座那些暮氣沉沉的老先生們有那麽深的涵養。一時熬不住飢渴與疲乏。捺不下焦煩與憤懣。就等那承啓官有一次在他身旁經過時。猛立起身來上前攔住、蹙縐着眉峰。顫動着聲浪。低頭下氣。輕輕問道。對不起。借問一聲。我那名片你替我遞上去了嗎。究竟見不見。督軍吩示過了嗎。那承啓官把一束名片向桌邊一挪。勃然大怒。就瞪眼球竪眉毛的向他發話道。我的爺。你這樣問我。我那裏曉得。不錯。我是吃大帥的飯。白大帥特派我來伺候各位老爺們的。只得替各位老爺一坐。拿出名片來說有公事要見大帥。我們那怕跑斷了兩條腿。也得替各位老爺們一一往上回。你那名片。我有那大的膽子。敢不遞上去嗎。至於大帥面前。他一天公事很忙。會客很多。若人人都要隨到隨見。這那裏辦得到。也不過是由我們將這一大把名片開列個單子送與大帥過目。由他老人家想先見那個就傳那個。他提起一位。我們就下來傳一聲。無非是奉命令行事。絶不能由我們作主。在他尙未開口時。我又不是他肚内的蛔蟲。怎麽會知道他見你不見。安玉田受了這一頓排揎。從耳根邊泛起滿臉的紅潮。幾乎惱羞得没有地方擱面子。但還是忍着氣忸怩說道、莫怪莫怪、我是等得太久了。想求你替我再上去問一聲。能辦就辦。不能辦也就算了。你何必動這大的氣。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨據日文報每日新聞載稱。宋因去年提議鴉片公賣失敗。此次亟謀實現。其心腹張壽鏞唐海安力圖進行公賣計劃。仍照去年所定方案進行云云。若此說而果確。我又要瞎說幾句。</p>
<p>鴉片的害國病民。人人能道。原不必我來再說。惟禁止鴉片律有專條。而私種私運私吃。並未絶跡。且某省設有特稅處。某省迫種鴉片。鴉片一物。原是已經公開的秘密。現在索性公開。不必遮遮掩掩。到也未始不可。</p>
<p>但國家旣懸令厲禁。則私種私吃私運。到底有些顧忌。有些不妨便。若一經公開。則不免有提倡性質。吃烟者之數量。自必突然增加。本來。有人說。我國已成爲「土匪」國。其解說謂大烟與匪徒也。若再公開。試問國家將成何種國家。人民將成何種人民。</p>
<p>倘使爲國家收入計。而忍痛爲之。則國營事業之可爲者尙多。如娼妓亦可公開。賭博不妨特稅。一經提倡。效力必鉅。如此將成爲「土匪賭娼」之國。請諸君閉目一思。將成何種現象。是使我中華民國。永遠沉淪於九泉之下。無天日之可見矣。</p>
<p>當然政府而果有此提倡的决心。那末前次因計劃的不善。以致失敗者。自有較好的計劃來補救。我亦惟有樂觀厥成。慶祝國家前途的幸福而已。</p>

<h3 id="c204">照相的原理 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 高潛</p>
<p>照相的功用，非常之廣，科學上，軍事上，法律上，美術上，都用得到，其中各種的手術，細論起來，都含有極高深的理論，决非三數言所可了結，我現在就常見的手續，說明其理由如下，</p>
<p>（一）對光　凡攝影之前，必先要在毛玻璃上對光，因爲物像有一定的焦點，要使影像清楚，必須使毛玻璃正落在焦點上，對光便是配準焦點，使影像十分清楚，</p>
<p>（二）攝影　對光之後，便可安上乾片盒攝影，攝影時將鏡頭開放使光線射到乾片上，</p>
<p>乾片上面塗有溴化銀一類的化合物，遇著光線便起有變化，</p>
<p>（三）顯影　乾片上面的膠膜雖起有變化，但是眼睛還看不出來，要使影像變成黑影，須經過藥液的作用，</p>
<p>顯影液是化學上的還原劑，將乾片浸在顯影液内，那受了光線作用的溴化銀便還原成爲銀粒，現出景物的黑影，白色物體反光强，所以銀粒還原的多，我們穿的白色衣服在乾片上便現出深黑色的像，黑色的物體，例如頭髮反光甚弱，所以乾片不大起有變化，影像便成空白，</p>
<p>（四）定影　影像雖經顯出，但是干片還不能遇見白光，否則影像完全雙黑，一定要將顯好的干片浸在定影液内，將未受光的溴化銀一齊溶去，於是底片上只剩黑色的影像了，水洗乾燥後，便是照相内所看見的「底片」，</p>
<p>（五）印像　底片上的影像，和實物相反，白色的衣服在上面是黑色，黑色的頭髮，在上面是空白，所以還要經過印像的手續，才能得到與實物相同的影像，印像就是用一種感光紙放在底片下，拿到光中晒印，頭髮的部分，底片上是空白，所以光線穿過的多，白的衣服，底片上是黑色，所以光線穿過的少，我們接著顯影的原理，將感光紙在顯影定影液中處理，便得與實物相同的「正像」，</p>
<p>我國會照相的人，一天天的加多，但是所用的原料和器具，一齊都是外國貨，每年流出的金錢，數目當不在小，現在感光紙國人已能製造，簡單的器具亦有好些能自造，但是最重要的「干片」和「照相機」還是絲毫不曾動手，「干片」日本人已經早能自製了，希望我國愛好攝影的人對於這上面多加注意，</p>

<h3 id="c205">國文課 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>擋擋擋Ｃ校的Ｄ敎室上國文課了，載着一副馬脚克的眼鏡的一位老先生很拘束的走到臺上，在點名的時候，全級的學生都應到的，但等到他點好名，抬起頭來，三分之一的學生已從側門裏溜出去了，他在講臺上很高興的講解，但下面的學生，依然在一個個溜掉，到了後來，幾十個學生，祗剩五六個，這種巴戲，他們雖在每次國文課都要玩一下的，但這次却因走的太多，瞞不過鈍光眼的老先生，他發覺了學生的溜掉，便向所剩的幾個追究起來，但他們都不肯告訴他，他的無名火頓時透起三尺，臺子亂碰，把書丢掉了，嘴裏眞在駡着「亡國奴」的老調，走到敎務室去報告校長，但第二天校長也没有什麽表示，第</p>
<p>三天那位老先生來上國文課，學生依舊續陸的在溜掉呢，</p>
<p>中國學生的不高興讀中文，早已成爲一件很普遍的事情，在這裏，我又想着了一件學生時代的笑話，我們畢業的那年，全班的同學，一共二十二人，考中文作文的那天，一般的同學，有幾個不會作文，急得要命，終於由一個同學代做了七篇，我也代做了三篇，但笑話因此發生了，在三個鐘點之中，要做幾篇作文，當是做不好的，我用鉛筆替他們起了一個草稿，派司過去，就算塞責，那知坐在我前面的朋友，抄寫的時候，把我的那張稿紙上的草字，謄差了好多個，因而交卷以後，被敎師察出，作不及格論，他就此得不到一紙高中的文憑，雖然經過了六年的苦續，當初在我滿心想帮助他，但結果竟害了他，這件事情，在我的心理，直到現在還覺得有些難過，但在這裏，我們也可見出一般中學生的中文程度了，不要說做，連抄都會抄差，原因就在平常的不高興上國文課，和不肯作文呀，</p>

<p>— 無畏</p>
<p>有一次到某理髮店去剪髮，在我坐下了約有一刻鐘後，又進來了一個顧客，祗聽得正在和我剪髮的小三子說「四個螺絲」，同時就有一個理髮匠待理不理的走上去，和那位顧客剪了，</p>
<p>我聽了「四個螺絲」底一句話，同時看到那個理髮匠十二分不高興的神情，知道那句話一定是他們的切口，並且一定是對於那個顧客有關的，所以想問問他們，但是終未出口，後來見那個顧客同一的剪髮，修面，倒比我先好，於是我忍不住，去問那小三子，剛纔你說的「四個螺絲」是什麽意思呢？我說「屋，那是四隻八開的意思，」</p>
<p>「你說那句話大概和剛纔那個顧客有關的，」</p>
<p>「是芽，那個脚色每次總是出四只八開，我和他剪了二次，總是這麽一點見，所以我關照他們别白出力」，</p>
<p>「那你們也太欺人了，四只八開，已經照你們底定價了一，我似乎和那個顧客打抱不平般的說，</p>
<p>「差是不差呀，先生，但是我們總希望顧客多出一點，那麽拆賬的時候可以多進賬點，」</p>
<p>我聽了暗說一聲慚愧，幸虧歷來都是給他們六只八開，不然，恐怕不次進門也會聽到四個螺絲的呼聲，或者還要觀到他們那種十二分不高興底神情吧，</p>

<p>上海是繁華底都市，又是世界大商塲之一，而南京路上，又是全上海熱閙的地方，凡商店廟底櫥窗内，總是滿貯着化裝品，消耗品，</p>
<p>衣料，什麽摩登綢，喬其紗，莖爾紗等，尤其是供給女子的用品爲多，要想找一家專供男子用品的店，竟可以說没有，足見女子奢華的情形較男子尤甚，因爲這類商店愈多，愈顯出女子奢華底程度高，他們商店的開設，當然是應着需要而産生，可是同時男子的負擔却也隨之增加了，</p>
<p>我從前的老同學Ｓ，每月有一百二十元薪水，照例，維持一個小家庭，可以綽綽有餘了，但是，他和我說，總感覺到不敷應用，因爲單是他夫人每月要八九十元的揮霍，她的用途是拾幾元的絲襪，每月二三雙，香水（白衣神）每月至少一瓶，皮鞋每月一雙，（最省）香烟（五華牌）每月拾汀，還有什麽衣料，香粉，每月她一人已經費去了薪水的一半，聽說，Ｓ夫人是極摩登的女性，她的意思一個女子消耗這些也不算什麽，但啊？在現今的社會裏，一個男子要擔負這許多，恐怕不是易事吧，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Three-Year Plan Established in Turkey <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>By Bin</p>
<p>Turkey, impoverished, chaotic, and weak, formally declared the end of its imperial government in 1923. After establishing a democratic regime, it gradually embarked on a path of revitalization. Subsequently, it abolished unequal treaties externally and vigorously pursued construction and reformed education internally, resulting in a daily increase in national strength. It has become a rising power in the Near East. Recently, following the example of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, it established a three-year plan. Turkish Prime Minister İsmet İnönü and Foreign Minister Tevfik Rüştü Aras visited the Soviet Union and secured a loan of eight million US dollars, mainly for financial and industrial projects, aiming to develop the textile, agricultural, and machinery industries. At the same time, the relationship between the two countries has been further strengthened by the Turkish Prime Minister's visit. For example, regarding cultural communication, both sides advocate for more direct methods, and scientific institutions are in contact with each other. Considering Turkey's years of dedicated governance and vigorous vitality, we can assert that its three-year plan will surely yield good results. At the same time, the mutual support between Turkey and the Soviet Union will surely benefit both countries and provide mutually beneficial assistance.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of Turkey's establishment of a three-year plan, several national sentiments arise within us. First, before its revolution, Turkey's national chaos and weakness were similar to those of our country. Its suffering from imperialist aggression and the constraints of unequal treaties was also no different from China's situation. However, the nation, once mired in poverty, chaos, and darkness, awakened and rose up with determination. Internally, it overthrew the autocratic and dark rule of the Sultan, establishing a revolutionary democratic regime. Externally, it freed itself from the control of imperialists, leading the nation to equality and freedom. Furthermore, it fought fiercely against the invading Greek army for three years, enduring persistent resistance and ultimately achieving national revival. The nation ultimately found its new life, compelling even the great powers to take notice. What about our country? Internal affairs are becoming increasingly chaotic, and external aggression is becoming more urgent. In contrast to Turkey's revival, shouldn't our country urgently awaken from its deep slumber and strive for the rebirth of our nation?</p>
<p>Secondly, we previously stated in a commentary titled "Unplanned Nations and Planned Nations" that a nation's politics are like a complete machine. Only when the machine's structure is sound and complete can its operation be flexible and unimpeded. Politics must also rely on the soundness of the government organization, and progress must be made simultaneously in a planned manner. Only then can the process follow a proper course, avoiding the waste of energy and preventing the proliferation of corruption. Turkish politics has gradually entered the right track. Therefore, its utilization of foreign capital to carry out the three-year plan will surely yield good results. Planning is the foundation of success for all endeavors. Individual actions should be planned, and a nation's politics and economy should have an overall plan. In our country today, everything lacks planning. Even if there is a plan, it is fragmented and uncoordinated, and it is mostly empty talk. It does not even consider its implementation. Take the Jiangsu Construction Department, for example: its three-year construction plan had just been announced when the members of the Jiangsu Provincial Government resigned en masse due to financial difficulties. Thus, its so-called three-year plan has effectively become a pie in the sky. One can assert: When will our country follow in the footsteps of the Soviet Union and Turkey, devising a comprehensive, practical, and step-by-step nation-building plan to lay the new foundation for our nation?</p>

<h3 id="e2">Fierce Battle in Southeastern Suburbs of Harbin <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Sounds of Heavy Artillery and Machine Guns Audible in the City</p>
<p>Japanese Army Retreats After Major Defeat, Then Regroups for Counterattack</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Led by Li Siru Occupies Yixian County</p>
<p>(Harbin) A fierce battle took place near Harbin last night. The Japanese army retreated after suffering a defeat, then planned a counterattack. The battlefield extended from a point five miles east of Harbin to a point four miles south of Harbin. Both sides engaged in full-force combat. The sounds of heavy artillery and machine guns could be clearly heard here. Residents were alarmed all night. A visitor from Shanghai said that Harbin at this time was similar to the Shanghai International Settlement during the fierce battle of Zhabei. The Anti-Manchu Army initially achieved considerable victories because the "Manchukuo" army defected and responded during the attack. The momentum of the Anti-Manchu Army surged, forcing the Japanese army south of Harbin to retreat after three hours of fierce fighting. It is reported that the Japanese army suffered over a hundred casualties. Soon after, the Japanese army regrouped and began a counterattack, which was quite fierce. Although the Anti-Manchu Army engaged in combat, its strength gradually waned after dawn, and it retreated. The Chinese Eastern Railway tracks and telegraph poles nine miles east of Harbin were completely destroyed by the Anti-Manchu Army. A repair train headed to the area but was almost surrounded by the Anti-Manchu Army. Railway workers, seeing bullets raining down, dared not proceed and quickly sped back to Harbin. Therefore, traffic to the east has now been disrupted. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Guerrilla Force Attacks Japanese Defense Zone <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Guoshan's troops concentrated in the Tongbei, Dedu, and Bei'an areas, and formed several guerrilla teams, which launched attacks against the defense zone of the Japanese Matsuki Brigade every night. The Japanese army is extremely uneasy. Japanese planes are dispatched daily, but the team's daytime concealment and nighttime attacks have no effect. Xu Baozhen's troops, formerly under Ma Zhanshan and stationed near the Qiqihar-Heihe Street area, defected entirely on the 10th and are currently engaged in a fierce battle with a small complete regiment of the Japanese Tano Brigade.

<p>Shanhaiguan: Volunteer armies from Xingcheng and Jinxi are advancing towards Lianshan. In the morning of the 12th, Zheng's troops made contact with the Japanese army at Cuijiatun, more than ten miles north of Lianshan. The Japanese army continuously reinforced its troops. The volunteer army is strong and fierce battles went on for quite some time with casualties on both sides. Five Japanese planes from Jinzhou urgently went to scout and bomb. Currently, the volunteer army is relying on the cover of the mountains and forests and is maneuvering very actively, continuing to engage in fierce battles. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>

It is reported that the Anti-Manchu Army has built a radio station in Lishugou to transmit messages. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>Claim They Are Involved in Bombing Case</p>
<p>Five Desperadoes Manipulate Police</p>
<p>(Harbin) Japanese police arrested four Chinese at the Chinese Eastern Railway station thirteen miles east of Harbin, claiming they were involved in the bombing of a Japanese military train east of Harbin on April 13. On that day, thirteen Japanese officers and over fifty Japanese soldiers were injured. Today it was reported that Ma Chongjun was arrested on June 8. The Japanese side suspects that he is a secret agent of Zhang Xueliang, who supplied the Anti-Manchu Army with a large amount of military supplies, and that he is involved in terrorist organizations in the East Provinces. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today it was learned that five desperadoes broke into the residence of Director Zhang of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau Management Office. Zhang, seeing their menacing appearance, escaped through a window and summoned the police to surround the house and arrest them. However, the bandits threatened that if the police opened fire, Zhang's wife, younger brother, and two daughters would be killed. The police, fearing the consequences, dared not shoot. Zhang, wanting to protect his family, gave the bandits a thousand yuan. The bandits took the money and calmly left in two cars. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Because banditry is rampant in Guangji, Qichun, and Wuxue in eastern Hubei, the Navy Department telegraphed the Datong warship to patrol the Huangshigang area and strengthen security.

<p>(Hankou) Guo Renqiu, representative of the Wuxue Chamber of Commerce, and others reported to the Pacification Headquarters on the 13th that Zhang Wanxin's troops stationed there were weak and in dire straits, requesting that troops be sent to assist.

Hao Mengling's troops will also be stationed in eastern Hubei. It is reported that the bandits are units of the 25th Army of the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army, which was severely damaged by Ge Shichong in Qishui. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Red bandits bypassed Qishui and Ximaban from Yingshan and invaded eastern Hubei. It is reported that Guangji County has fallen, and Huangmei County is in danger.

<p>Shanhaiguan: The Japanese army is implementing a conscription system in western Liaoning. The Jinzhou Japanese Army Department has now formulated measures for the self-defense superintendencies of the twelve counties in western Liaoning, urging the counties to begin conscripting group Ding, divided into regular and reserve types, with ten men per village as the unit, limited to strong men over the age of twenty. Each county forms a regiment, directly under the superintendency and indirectly under the Jinzhou Japanese Army Department, with the obligation to maintain security and participate in combat. The positions of superintendent and councilor are appointed by the Japanese Army Department. Firearms and ammunition are supplied from the people's own resources. If these are insufficient or when replenished, they will be issued by the Japanese Army Department. The conscription deadline is one month. After the number of conscripts in each village is determined, they will be sent to each county to be trained by Japanese officers. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>

The formal name of the supreme leader is likely to be "Plenipotentiary of Manchuria" or "Governor-General of Manchuria."

<p>(Beiping) As for the location for the investigation team to compile its report, the Japanese side opposes Beidaihe, and Qingdao is inconvenient. After discussion among the five representatives, it was decided to select a suitable location outside of Beidaihe and Qingdao, which are advocated by China and Japan respectively, based on the team's own free will. Most members advocate Beiping as the most suitable: (1) The climate is suitable; (2) There are many embassies, making it difficult to surround; (3) Transportation is convenient, and it is easy to contact related countries; (4) It is convenient to access relevant Chinese and Japanese treaties and files; (5) It can resolve differences and disputes between China and Japan; (6) Most representatives prefer to live in Beiping, and the American representative and his wife are very pleased with this and plan to stay in the Western Hills for a long time.

<p>London: The Daily News reports that Japan originally advocated holding the Shanghai Round Table Conference in the near future. Recently, the diplomatic community heard that the ambassadors of various countries had jointly approached Tokyo, requesting a delay in convening the conference, which was quite strange. Commentators said that the reason the ambassadors made this request was because the Japanese government wanted to prevent China from properly participating in the conference. As for the United States, it firmly wants China to attend on an equal footing with the powers, but at the same time, it fears that if China attends, it will raise the issue of Manchuria at the conference, which would lead to fierce disputes between the United States and Japan.

<p>China Employs Most Soldiers</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The International Disarmament Conference's list of the number of standing armies and navies of various countries in 1932 ranks China first, with a complete army of 1.8 million men. The United Kingdom's standing army and navy is 112,273 men, the United States' is 153,037 men, and France's is 422,737 men. This is due to colonies such as Africa, Vietnam, and Madagascar, which necessitate so many troops. However, France finds it difficult to support so many soldiers. Italy has 513,555 men due to the need to prepare for the colonies of Trasbolu, etc. Japan's standing army and navy is 276,647 men, including Korea, Taiwan, and Kwantung. The statistics for the five major powers, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan, show a total of 1,478,249 standing soldiers, which is still 320,000 less than China's alone. Huang Musong, the representative of our country at the Disarmament Conference, sent this list to the Liu government, requesting that it be circulated to all soldiers and civilians in the country. A certain military strategist said that the troops listed in the table are only the formal troops. If the quasi-bandit, quasi-soldier miscellaneous troops are included, another 700,000 men could be added. For example, Liu Wenhui in Sichuan has recently indiscriminately recruited 200,000 troops. The number of troops exceeding the original quota is more than ten provinces. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>

Regarding the disarmament issue, it is heard that the two countries' authorities have agreed to suspend the arms race for ten to fifteen years, supplemented by reducing armaments and land and naval budgets by 5% or 10%, and to have the countries attending the Disarmament Conference sign a declaration reiterating their adherence to the basic principles of the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In addition, it is also heard that an agreement has been reached on rescuing Austrian finances.

<p>Reuters, Paris, 12th: British Prime Minister MacDonald's visit to Paris has been very welcomed, calling it a good prelude to the Lausanne reparations conference and a good omen for the Geneva disarmament conference.

<p>Reuters: The main event discussed between the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary and the French cabinet members was the reparations issue. It is generally believed that an extension of Germany's moratorium on reparations payments is unavoidable, but this move must be carried out in a situation that avoids Germany unilaterally declaring the abolition of debts. This move can allow European countries that owe debts to the United States to calmly formulate a common attitude towards creditor countries in the hope that the United States may cancel the debts after the presidential election. As for the issue of military contraction, the French seem to have leaned towards the British military holiday proposal.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Paris Times Commentary <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 12th: The Paris Times editorial commented on the British-French negotiations, saying: "What we can prove at present is that the start of the negotiations is very good because both sides are seeking practical solutions in a spirit of cooperation. The various issues to be discussed in Geneva and Lausanne in the coming days are as intricate as a tangled thread, and the attitude taken by the United States towards the war debts issue makes it impossible to fundamentally and definitively resolve these issues. The British and French authorities do not avoid difficulties and strive to solve them, which is deeply commendable. The world economic panic is indeed affected by various issues. For the sake of the world's interests, it is advisable to eliminate these issues completely. However, sometimes, due to the urgency of the situation, it is not possible to be too hasty, and delaying the matter may be more prudent. For example, in modern international issues, the United Kingdom and France often consult with each other first, and this happens whenever there is a crisis. This does not mean that the United Kingdom and France want to force their predetermined</p>
<p>opinions on other countries. The reason why the two countries consult with each other first is merely to exchange opinions and lay a beneficial foundation for future discussions, so that the spirit of cooperation can achieve its full effect. Therefore, we must wait until the British-French negotiations are fully underway before we can speculate on what practical effects we expect. What we know is that the impression of the first contact between the two premiers was very good. The atmosphere it created is deeply conducive to close cooperation between the two sides. If it can continue like this, then the Geneva and Lausanne meetings will be greatly facilitated. There is no need for divine intervention to silently assist them, because the affairs of the divine are politically impossible. In a few months, various major world issues will be awaiting resolution. This British-French meeting has truly opened the door to convenience for these issues."</p>

Secretary of State Stimson and his cabinet members all feel that the reduction or cancellation of war debts is unavoidable, but for domestic reasons, this political view has not yet been expressed.</p>

<p>Outcome of the Three State Premiers' Meeting with the President</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 12th: The apprehension of the South German states regarding the new policies of the federal government has been greatly reduced after the premiers of Bavaria, Baden, and Württemberg met with the president today. According to the official announcement, the three premiers had a thorough conversation with the president for an hour and a half. The federal premier was also present.

According to official sources, the conversations between the three premiers and the president were primarily to express the concerns of the South German side regarding certain points in the federal government's policies that had not been clearly stated. After these points were clarified, all doubts were dispelled. Papen also assured the three premiers, in order to dispel their fears about future policies. It is reported that the three premiers particularly opposed the plan to appoint Prussian administrative commissioners, fearing that it would set a bad precedent. Papen repeatedly stated that the federal government also does not approve of this proposal and will not resort to this final measure unless the Prussian cabinet deadlock cannot be resolved. In addition, they protested the revocation of the ban on the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers. It is reported that Papen has agreed that all paramilitary organizations will be strictly managed by the government.</p>

Therefore, this platform will focus on domestic affairs, especially on economic and prohibition issues. However, regarding economic issues, the convention will naturally fully support President Hoover's steps to save the economic decline. Therefore, it is predicted that the focus of debate at this convention will be on the prohibition issue, because this issue is extremely important in the party's stance and is also extremely difficult. If it is advocated that the prohibition law be re-discussed, millions of votes from the liberalization faction in major cities can be obtained, reducing the power of the Democratic Party. Otherwise, if there is no mention of this issue in the platform, these millions of voters will change to the opposing party.</p>

<p>After Drifting in the Sea for Eight Days and Nights</p>
<h3 id="e102">American Aviator Hawks Rescued <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 12th: Aviator Hawks departed from here on the 3rd of this month to Europe by plane, but there was no news. Everyone thought he had no hope of survival. Today, Mrs. Hawks suddenly received a telegram from the chief mate of a British oil tanker, saying that Hawks had been rescued last night. The plane he was riding in landed in the Atlantic on the evening of the 3rd. Hawks drifted in the sea for eight days and nights. His body is very weak and he is unable to describe what happened, but he was not injured. It is noted that Hawks' rescue depended on his plane's fuel tank, which was equipped with a safety door that automatically closed before landing on the water, preventing water from flowing in and allowing the fuel tank to become an air bag, allowing the plane to float on the surface.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Hankou Japanese Goods Trading Merchants <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Completely Bankrupt</p>
<p>Reaching 4,000 Households</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that from the Shanghai Incident to the establishment of the ceasefire agreement, trade along the Yangtze River was completely closed for six months. The market in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was first hit by floods, followed by bandits and the impact of anti-Japanese sentiment. The fate of trade has been completely destroyed. It is found that after Hankou was hit by floods, one-third of the 150 money shops have closed down. When the Shanghai Incident broke out, those on the verge of bankruptcy also followed suit. According to customs statistics, Wuhan's trade last year was 248,730,000 taels, deducting re-exports, the actual amount was 208,350,000 taels, which is the lowest record in the past five years. In January of this year, the import of foreign goods was halved compared to last year, and exports also did not reach one-third. Trade in February was completely stopped. In March and April, although American cotton, British cotton, groceries, soybean oil, wheat, etc. showed a slight improvement, these goods were still limited to the Wuhan area, only to supply the needs of the citizens. As for the inland sales channels, they were completely cut off. According to the investigation of the Wuhan Garrison Commander's Office, since February, among the three towns of Wuhan, 84 grocery stores, 79 cotton cloth merchants, 6 paper companies, 6 printing companies, 3 rickshaw companies, 3 shipping companies, 6 transportation companies, 16 factories, 83 foreign grocery trading companies, 20+ woodworking companies, 18 ironware companies, 58 rice merchants, and 1 hardware merchant, totaling 388 companies, have closed down. 80% of them are Japanese goods trading merchants. Due to the anti-Japanese result, they have completely gone bankrupt. According to recent investigations, there are 14,000 shops in Hankou, and 4,000 households engaged in Japanese goods have gone bankrupt. The most prosperous Zhongshan Road and Minsheng Road are now desolate.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Details After Arriving in Qingdao <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Representative Gu Has Earnest Conversation</p>
<p>Various Organizations Send a General Memorandum</p>
<p>Location for Compiling Report Seems Undecided</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The League of Nations Investigation Team, led by Lytton, arrived in Qingdao on the evening of the 9th. At 8:00 AM on the 10th, Qingdao reporters went to the Guest House to visit Lytton. When they arrived, Mayor Shen and Councilor Yang were downstairs. It was said that Lytton had not yet gotten up. If there were any inquiries, they could be submitted in writing to Representative Gu for transmission. The reporters then went to the International Sanatorium to visit Representative Gu. They were received. The reporters first expressed their condolences to Representative Gu for his hard work and selfless devotion to the country, and then translated what they wanted to ask Lytton into English and asked Representative Gu to transmit it. After reading it, Gu agreed to forward it immediately. Finally, the reporters asked Representative Gu about his feelings about accompanying the investigation team to investigate outside the pass. He answered in detail. The following is a record of the situation.</p>
<p>Representative Gu's remarks: Briefly stated that the feelings I have received during this trip to the three northeastern provinces are extremely profound. I have repeatedly published them in the newspapers. I think everyone must have seen them. However, regarding the situation in the Northeast, it is really necessary to reiterate to you. When I went to the Northeast with the investigation team for investigation, the other party nominally provided protection, but in fact secretly monitored us. Every move was not free. I wanted to talk to our compatriots, but it was not allowed by the facts. Even if our compatriots wanted to talk to me, it was also difficult. Therefore, the publicly obtained investigation materials are very few. However, when going out shopping or in hotels, I occasionally obtained a small amount of true materials from the shopkeepers or tea servants. Now the 30 million compatriots in the three northeastern provinces have tasted the pain of national subjugation and cannot appeal. They are extremely eager for troops to be sent from inside the pass to recover the lost land in the Northeast and rescue them from the fire and water. Moreover, most of the compatriots outside the pass are from Shandong. I am very willing to make the people of the country understand the suffering they have suffered and be able to find ways to rescue them. In the future, I hope that the compatriots inside the pass, whether in or out of office, will always keep the three northeastern provinces in their hearts and never forget them. Everyone should do their best and everyone should do this. There may be hope for the recovery of the three northeastern provinces. Chinese people always think that the land is large and the population is large, and the country will never be subjugated. However, judging from the current situation, if we do not work together and do it ourselves, even if the land is larger and the population is larger, we will inevitably be subjugated. The reason why Japan can be strong is because of its strong unity. No matter how chaotic the internal affairs are, it is still consistent externally and works towards a common goal. It will not stop until it achieves its goal. Therefore, its power can be so great. Looking back at the internal situation of our country, it is really unbearable to think about. Now, I can only report the suffering suffered by the compatriots in the Northeast to the people of the country, and I especially hope that the press will awaken the people of the country, so that everyone can take responsibility, be consistent externally, and quickly find a way to recover the lost land. Because the Northeast Incident is not only related to North China, but also related to the survival of our entire country.</p>
<p>Inspecting Summer Resort Locations: Lytton and the German and Italian representatives, Japanese Ambassador Yoshida, and our representative Gu Weijun, etc., went to the Municipal Government at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 10th to formally visit Mayor Shen. Then, led by Mayor Shen, they took cars to Gangshan to inspect the summer resort locations. On that day, the sea fog covered the sky and it was dark, showing a gloomy atmosphere. After arriving at Zhan Mountain, the group got off the car and inspected various places, looking at several vacant rooms, but none of them were satisfactory. Then they turned back to the First Park and toured around. Then they went to inspect the building at No. 4 Muping Road. The building is owned by Japanese Mine Village Masami and is currently rented by the German Consulate as a dormitory. The interior furnishings are luxurious. Lytton and others visited the building up and down. However, the building is close to the racecourse and is even more noisy than the city. After inspecting the International Sanatorium, they went to the Guest House to attend Mayor Shen's banquet. According to a certain foreigner, Qingdao often has sea fog in the summer, and the heat is humid, which hinders work. Moreover, the purpose of choosing a summer resort is to facilitate work reports, not to compare tourist destinations. Therefore, we should not only pay attention to the beauty of the scenery, but also pay attention to the freedom of the air.</p>

<p>Various Circles Send Memorandums: At 2:00 PM, at the Mayor's residence, they received representatives from various circles, including eight representatives from the press, academia, industry, and commerce. Yang Zhensheng, the president of Qingdao University, was publicly elected to deliver a welcome speech, which was translated by Professor Tan Baoshen of Qingdao University. The general idea was that the League of Nations Investigation Team came from afar due to the Sino-Japanese dispute. On behalf of all the citizens of Qingdao, we express our welcome, condolences, and gratitude. The citizens of Qingdao have always strictly observed order and tried their best to avoid disputes between China and Japan. Next, it was mentioned the dispute caused by the Republic of China Daily publishing news of the assassination of the Japanese Emperor in January of this year, as well as the situation of the Japanese privately manufacturing bombs and selling heroin, morphine, and opium and other drugs in Qingdao, which harmed the Chinese people. The report was very detailed. Then, Lytton replied, briefly saying that he was ashamed to receive the warm welcome and condolences from the representatives. Our delegation is really undeserving. Now our delegation has traveled for four months, and we have met with important figures from the Chinese and Japanese governments several times. We have obtained a lot of materials for reference. It will not be difficult to report to the League of Nations in the future. We hope that the governments and people of China and Japan can have sincerity, and the various problems between China and Japan can be easily solved. Finally, the representatives presented a memorandum and many photos to the investigation team and left. The main points of the memorandum are as follows: (1) Express welcome and condolences to the investigation team, (2) Hope that the investigation team will report the results of the investigation to the League of Nations fairly and completely, (3) The citizens of Qingdao unanimously support the Chinese National Government in complying with the League of Nations resolution to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, and make the following suggestions: A. Set a deadline for the Japanese army to completely withdraw from the territory unreasonably occupied, B. If the Japanese side does not fulfill it, please invoke Article 16 of the Covenant, (4) State in detail the process of Japanese residents approaching and oppressing our citizens.</p>
<p>The Situation When Leaving Qingdao: After the investigation team received representatives from various circles, they went to Laoshan to visit the scenery in the strong wind. However, Lytton did not go due to his old age. Representative Gu planned to talk with representatives from various circles at the Municipal Government Club at No. 4 Wendeng Road about four and a half hours after touring Laoshan. When the time came, the representatives arrived and waited.</p>
<p>Later, because Representative Gu returned late from touring the mountains, there was not enough time, so it was stopped.</p>
<p>At about 6:00 PM, the special train heading west for the investigation team had already fired up and was waiting to depart. Military alert was the same as when it arrived. About 200 representatives from various circles were at the station to see them off. Before long, Mayor Shen and Lytton arrived at the station. The reporters then asked Representative Gu about Lytton's written reply. Gu replied that due to the limited time, he had not yet replied, and he would mail it later. Then they boarded the train together. At 6:15 PM, the special train hurriedly headed west amid the music of the military. (June 11)</p>

<h3 id="e105">The Situation of Visiting Mount Tai <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Lytton and Others Were in High Spirits</p>
<p>Climbing Directly to the Jade Emperor Peak</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The special train of the investigation team heading west from Qingdao arrived in Jinan at 4:15 AM on the 11th, and departed from Jinan again at 4:55 AM to visit Mount Tai. At 6:48 AM, it arrived in Tai'an. Tai'an County Magistrate Zhou Bairong, Public Security Bureau Chief Bin Zhaokang, and representatives from various circles welcomed them at the station. After the train stopped, the members got up, washed, and had some refreshments. At 8:00 AM, they got off the train. The county government prepared 50 mountain sedan chairs for visiting the mountains, but most of the members were unwilling to get on the sedan chairs. They walked into the city from the station to observe the situation of the streets and markets. Stores and residents along the street hung national flags. Lytton and Sidney were in the front, and Representative Gu and others followed, talking as they walked. Police along the street added posts to maintain order. However, after the rain the day before, there was a lot of water on the streets, which was inconvenient for walking, so they took mountain sedan chairs. After leaving the north gate, the road gradually became dry. The members still got off the sedan chairs and walked. When passing the stone where the Goddess of Mount Tai dressed her hair to Douzongfang, Lytton loved its magnificent architecture and took a photo with his camera. From then on, they went further, climbing step by step, passing Fengdu City, the Imperial Palace Courtyard, and the Three Emperors Temple, without staying for long. When they reached Baihe Spring, the body of Sun Zhenren sitting in meditation, and then went up to the Great King Temple, the Guan Emperor Temple, and the Shanxi Guild Hall, at 9:10 AM, they reached the First Heaven Gate. Lytton saw paper ingots in the roadside memorial shop and thought they were interesting, and praised the stone carvings seen along the way as ancient and elegant, and thought that Eastern art was so exquisite. At that time, a Taoist bowed to everyone and invited them to stay in the temple for tea, but they did not enter. Then they walked into the Red Gate (ie, the place where Confucius ascended) to Doumu Palace. At 9:50 AM, the members and Zhang Honglie, Gu Weijun, Zhou Baizhong, the magistrate of Tai'an County, and Bin Zhaokang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, etc., drank tea there and rested for a while. Then they continued to bravely move forward. After leaving the palace and getting on the mountain sedan chair, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial was in sight.</p>
<p>Going up again, passing Wolong Huai, Gao Gong Bridge, San Gong Dian, to Jing Shi Yu, Water Curtain Cave, Stone Cliff, Liangshan Yu, He Ma Cliff, Bai Dong, Hu Tian Pavilion, and Hui Ma Ling, the mountain became more and more strange and steep. The walls were thousands of feet high, and people walked under it, trembling with fear. However, the sedan bearers were as flat as Yi, with courage and climbed, at 11:10, arrived at Zhongtianmen, most of the members got off the sedan chair to view the scenery, before long, they took a short rest by the road, Lytton and others admired each place, sighed for its greatness, after a quarter of an hour, they continued to reach Yunbu Bridge, the scenery here is excellent, is the crown of the whole mountain, and the cliffs are steep, attached with artificial stone steps, the red wooden railings by the bridge, especially Ya Jue, and then up for Chaoyang Cave, Eighteen Plate, Lytton extremely happy, slowly walked, Nai Di Bixia Palace, to that is the food they brought, taken out to satisfy hunger, shifted time only finished, from then up to Wangri Guanfeng and Houshi House, and to the Jade Emperor Peak, climbed its extreme place, members and other photos a lot, until half past three in the afternoon before going down the mountain, four to Zhongtianmen, six past twenty to the station,</p>
<p>Lytton originally carried a white cloth lotus leaf hat, but when he saw the Chinese reed hat worn by the sedan bearers, he liked its light weight and ability to shade the sun, so he asked the sedan bearers for one and wore it. The other members also wore one each, and all praised it. The one worn by Lytton was blown away by the wind when he went down the mountain, and he could not find it after searching all over. Lytton was very sad. After boarding the train, he opened north at 6:35, only one hour later than the scheduled time, The chief of the machine section, Zhang Yuanhe, personally drove the car and accelerated to travel 180 miles in one hour and twenty-nine minutes, which coincided with the scheduled time. The car was stable and fast, and the investigation team also praised it. At the Jinan station, the welcoming staff had gathered. Zhang Honglie, the representative of Chairman Han, got off the train, and Gu Weijun also got off the train because he was going to Nanjing. Then Wang Guangqi, the director of the delegation's office in Ping, accompanied the investigation team and opened north from Jinan at 8:45. According to Gu Weijun, the location for the investigation team to compile the report has not yet been determined. It will be determined after arriving in Ping. I will take a plane to Beijing from Jinan tomorrow morning. (Zhang Xueliang, the pacification director of Peiping, sent a plane, which flew to Zhangzhuang this afternoon, specifically for Gu to ride.) When visiting Mount Tai, there was fog at the foot of the mountain, but the fog cleared and the sky was clear on the mountain. The members took many photos and were very happy. After talking, he took a car to the provincial government to visit Chairman Han Fuqu, and stayed at the Jiaoji Hotel in the evening. He will fly to Beijing from Jinan tomorrow morning.

<p>Su Provincial Government</p>
<h3 id="e106">Entire Committee Resigns <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Due to Financial Difficulties, Nothing Can Be Done</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The entire committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Government has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for resignation, due to financial difficulties and the inability to carry out any work. The original request is as follows: "We hereby submit this request due to the exhaustion of finances and the inability to proceed with various administrative matters. We earnestly request approval for our resignation in order to avoid delaying provincial affairs. We respectfully congratulate our colleagues for being appointed to preside over the administration of Jiangsu Province. Following the collapse of the Grand Canal and during the period when embankment work awaits repair, the provincial treasury was already very strained, and raising funds was especially difficult. However, considering the millions of disaster victims and the devastation in more than ten counties, we felt deeply distressed and could not rest day or night. Due to our responsibilities, we dared not refuse the difficulties. We exhausted the provincial treasury, borrowed from banks, and solicited from charitable organizations. The total funds raised amounted to slightly more than two million yuan. In addition, we were ordered to assist with one million yuan. This major project could be completed on schedule. However, only one hundred thousand yuan of the assistance funds has been allocated to date. Subsequently, the War of Resistance against Japan erupted, and large armies converged. Jiangsu Province bore the brunt of the impact. All kinds of rear-area needs, such as the recruitment of laborers, the requisition of ships, the procurement of materials, the supply of provisions, the treatment of wounded soldiers, the accommodation of displaced women and children, and the facilities for air defense, poison gas prevention, and the repair of city walls as ordered, all required huge sums of money and could not be delayed. We and our colleagues, mindful of the great righteousness of resisting Japan and aware of the fierceness of the war, instructed all counties to raise funds with great effort. These were all expenditures of the provincial treasury. Although we repeatedly petitioned the central government to handle military logistics, we have not yet received an order to implement it. In total, the funds advanced by various counties in Jiangsu Province for the War of Resistance amount to more than one million yuan. Last year, a major flood occurred, and the Jiangnan seawall was also impacted by storm tides, with many breaches. Coastal counties were severely affected. We were planning to cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Government to plan repairs, but the War of Resistance broke out, making it impossible to proceed. Since the establishment of the ceasefire agreement, we have been earnestly planning and undertaking repairs. The funds required for temporary repairs are estimated at two million yuan, but only more than four hundred thousand yuan has been raised so far. Combining these temporary expenditures, they have reached four million yuan. Jiangsu Province is a rich area, and its finances have always been considered ample. However, since we and our colleagues took office, we have thoroughly audited the accumulated deficits over the years, which amount to a staggering twenty million yuan. In addition, due to last year's floods and this year's military affairs, land taxes have been sharply reduced, and there is no revenue from business taxes. Even without temporary expenditures, it would be impossible to maintain the status quo. Moreover, embankment work, seawall work, and military advances have added significantly to the burden, and they are all essential and cannot be delayed. The province's financial resources are limited. An increase in one area will inevitably lead to a shortage in another. Therefore, although provincial administrative expenses have been tightened again and again, and affiliated institutions have been merged again and again, we have also followed the clear orders of the central government to provide all civil servants in the province with living expenses, hoping to overcome this difficult time with a spirit of austerity.</p>
<p>However, military and police expenses, as well as administrative expenses, are still in arrears for five, six, three, or four months. Although we have tried to follow the precedent of seventeen years ago by requisitioning two months' rent from the entire province, hoping to provide some relief, the amount collected is very small due to various factors. It is like a drop in the bucket, which is of no help. Currently, the canal embankment is nearing completion, but still requires more than six hundred thousand yuan. The seawall work is just beginning, and the shortfall is also hundreds of thousands of yuan. The twentieth year is coming to an end, and the arrears of military, police, and administrative expenses are even greater. Looking ahead, our worries are endless. This is the real situation of the exhausted finances of Jiangsu Province in the twentieth year. For several months, we and our colleagues have lamented the financial difficulties of Jiangsu Province and the inability to carry out administrative affairs. We have repeatedly consulted, hoping to remedy the situation in the twenty-first year. Therefore, we ordered the Department of Finance to accurately audit the income and expenditure of various temporary funds and prepare a budget. However, after many discussions, the draft budget could not be established. The main sources of income for the provincial treasury are only land taxes and business taxes. More than a year has passed since the implementation of the business tax, but due to various practical difficulties, it not only fails to offset the likin tax, but also fails to cover the collection costs. It is realistically impossible to use it as a reliable source of funds. The total annual income from land taxes, excluding the designated education funds, which amount to more than two million yuan, is only more than five million yuan. Adding other miscellaneous income, the total is only more than seven million yuan. Moreover, it is necessary to repay bank loans for canal embankment and seawall work, military advances from various counties, and short-term loans from the twentieth year. The income that can be listed as provincial treasury revenue is only more than three million yuan. The lowest amount required for temporary expenses is more than fourteen million yuan, resulting in a shortfall of more than ten million yuan. Moreover, essential policies during the period of political tutelage, such as local autonomy, land surveying, and road policing, all require huge sums of money and urgently need to be implemented. However, given the current state of the provincial treasury, it is impossible to even maintain the status quo, let alone start construction. We have repeatedly consulted and tried to find ways to increase revenue from among the impossible, but either they are restricted by laws and regulations, or they hinder the central government's tax revenue. It seems inappropriate to interfere with the central government's prestige due to the difficulties of one province. Thinking day and night, we are at a loss. We and our colleagues were ordered to come to Jiangsu, originally hoping to do our best to promote political tutelage, to repay the expectations of the central government and to comfort the people's hopes. However, things have gone against our wishes, and our hearts are willing, but our strength is insufficient. Rather than holding on to our positions and wasting resources, both our own and the province's, it would be better to retire early to make way for the capable. After repeated discussions and consultations, we have unanimously decided to state the actual situation of the exhausted finances and the inability to promote administration. We humbly request approval for our resignation in order to avoid delaying matters. We are grateful beyond measure. Respectfully submitted to Wang, President of the Executive Yuan. Local dispatch."</p>

<p>Education Bureau Chief Rectifies Decadent Practices: County Education Bureau Chief Zhu Zhaosheng, upon being appointed to take office, immediately followed the bureau's order to tighten the organization. The number of education committee members, originally set at six, will now be reduced to four. As the school districts are about to be reorganized, Qian Guohua, principal of the Xinqiao Elementary School in the Fourth District, Sun Zongzhen, principal of the Qianjing Elementary School, and seventeen others jointly petitioned the new Bureau Chief Zhu, stating that at the beginning of this reform, there may be changes in the education committee. Xu, the Education Committee member in the Fourth District, Jianhua, has served the local community for many years, inspecting diligently and providing effective guidance. They earnestly request that he be retained and not transferred to ensure the retention of experienced personnel. Bureau Chief Zhu immediately issued a written reply, stating, "Received. The promotion and dismissal of education committee members is the responsibility of this bureau chief. At the beginning of my tenure, I am still seriously considering whether the education committee member in that district is competent. The principals, leading the entire school, do not focus on teaching and correcting themselves. They dare to jointly petition, overstepping their boundaries to test the waters, initiating the evil practice of favoritism and factionalism in the education sector, and setting a precedent for children to disregard hierarchy and pursue external gains. This is not at all in line with this bureau chief's intention to value teachers and rectify the academic atmosphere. What is the underlying motive? Who is the instigator? I order each of you to clearly report within three days and await investigation."</p>
<h3 id="e108">Wuxi <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Relieves Unemployed Merchants: At the third joint meeting of the current session of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the representative of the Jinle District Chamber of Commerce proposed a motion to request local chambers of commerce to find ways to relieve unemployed merchants. Three measures were adopted: (1) The chamber of commerce should first conduct a survey of the number of unemployed people in the local area and conduct registration and review. (2) Those with bad habits and improper behavior should be sent to the local vagrant workshop to quit their habits and be forced to work. (3) A. Organize a job placement office. B. Organize an unemployment relief fund committee. C. Organize an interest-free loan office. In European and American countries, there are monthly statistics on the number of unemployed people, which is given extraordinary attention. Jiangsu Province has recently experienced natural disasters and man-made calamities, and all industries are in decline. The number of unemployed people is increasing daily. If no measures are taken to relieve them, they will inevitably face financial ruin, go astray, and affect social stability. Yesterday, the measures were copied and sent to local chambers of commerce for planning and implementation.</p>
<p>Construction Department Strictly Demands Construction Bond Loans: The Jiangsu Construction Department recently sent a telegram to the Wuxi County Government regarding the construction of the Jing-Tang Road, demanding that three thousand yuan be continuously transferred from the construction bond loan under the construction expenses item within five days, with severe punishment for exceeding the deadline. County Magistrate Chen, upon receiving the telegram, stated that although various funds had been collected and deposited in Wuxi, they had already been fully transferred and there were no remaining funds available for allocation. He submitted it to the 141st county administrative meeting for joint discussion. It was decided that the county had previously borrowed 30,000 yuan from various organizations for construction expenses due to urgent military needs to cope with the situation. Later, upon receiving the department's order to return the funds, the original borrowing organizations were consulted to find ways to raise funds and return them to the original depositing bank separately. Based on the department's check-signing, 16,000 yuan was disbursed for repair expenses and 6,000 yuan for military expenses. Of the remaining 8,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan had already been allocated for construction bond loans, leaving only 3,000 yuan. Since a telegram was received from the provincial government forwarding a telegram from the Military Commission, ordering the preparation of wages for the excavation of trenches from the Changshu border to Taihu Lake in the county, a total of seventy li in length, the amount was large and the deadline was tight, and the matter concerned national defense, it was not dared to delay. After much searching and scraping, it was still far from enough. It was unavoidable to temporarily divert these three thousand yuan to meet the emergency, and it was reported to the provincial government to allocate funds for reimbursement. Now that the deadline is imminent, it can only be reported for allocation after the wages for the trench construction are reimbursed by the provincial government. The section chief of the department, Lin Lizheng, was dispatched to the Construction Department to personally present the details of the incident. Director Dong severely rebuked Chen, saying that the county magistrate had failed to comply with the order to raise and disburse funds, and had made excuses to delay. He still demanded that the funds be raised and disbursed immediately.</p>

<p>Police Officer Leads Assault on Civilians, Arousing Public Outrage: Chen La, patrol officer of the Xincang Public Security Sub-bureau, and a woman surnamed Xu, broke into the inner room of Fan Lairong's barbershop in the West Market the day before yesterday and whispered privately. Fan was very displeased and spoke irritably, which angered Patrol Officer Chen. He immediately returned to the bureau and led six or seven police officers to arrest Fan and take him to the bureau, severely beating him along the way. He was sentenced to twelve days of detention. The shops that witnessed the police officers committing the crime all felt indignant. The Taiyi Hall and other businesses jointly petitioned the county government to punish the illegal patrol officer. Yesterday, the county government sent officials to Xin to summon the witnesses to the county for questioning.</p>

<p>Celebrate Teachers' Day</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch, June 6: The national education sector has designated June 6 as Teachers' Day. Hunan teachers and staff Yu Zhenchu, Fang Kegang, Luo Jiaoduo, and others, due to the fact that teachers and staff opinions in Hunan have been scattered in recent years, making it difficult to reach a consensus on any proposition, held the first Teachers' Day celebration in Changsha at Zhongshan Hall at 2 PM this afternoon for the sake of their fellow teachers and to improve teachers' treatment and enhance their self-cultivation. More than 300 people attended. Wen Yawen presided over the meeting, explaining the significance of holding Teachers' Day and the points that should be worked on in the future. Then Chen Shuyuan of the Party Committee and Xie Kun, a representative of the student union, spoke in succession, hoping to guide young students based on the actual situation and objective experience and to determine an education plan to shed a ray of light on the education sector in southern Hunan. Subsequently, many people gave free speeches. Finally, after mutual discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) Submit a request to the Education Department to forward to the Ministry of Education to confirm June 6 as Teachers' Day, and to close schools for one day on that day for commemoration. (2) Send telegrams to educational institutions inside and outside the province to unanimously endorse the three points advocated by the education sector in Beijing and Shanghai: improving teachers' treatment, guaranteeing teachers' status, and enhancing teachers' self-cultivation. (3) Issue a declaration. (4) Submit a request to the Provincial Party Headquarters for permission to organize a joint association of teachers and staff, and nominate Wen Yawen, Zeng Shengzhai, Wang Tingkai, Yu Shenchu, Yang Bairong, Huang Dean, Pan Shimo, and others as temporary preparatory members.

<p>I have always believed that the greatest task of education has three aspects: cultivating personality, guiding thought, and imparting knowledge. Therefore, all three must be present in order to complete the entire task of education. It has been more than thirty years since our country began to establish schools. Speaking of its effectiveness, the people's intelligence has been developed day by day, the people's morality has been followed day by day, thoughts have become increasingly mixed, and the academic atmosphere has become increasingly frivolous. The collapse has flowed horizontally, and its momentum has been unstoppable. Where is the benefit that the country and society have received from the school? It is difficult for anyone to point it out. Exhausting decades of time and exhausting the efforts of people across the country, the harvest is actually like this. What is more painful than this? Although it is said that the evolution of facts and the causes are multiple, the fact that educators only focus on the infusion of knowledge and neglect the guidance of personality and thought is the main cause of this evil result. The scale of modern schools is vast, and the number of students is also large. Educators regard enlightening knowledge as their primary responsibility, and scholars regard acquiring knowledge as their satisfaction. The function of the school has become merely a place for knowledge vendors. The personality and thoughts of thousands of people are entrusted to the hands of two or three fostering personnel. What about the words and actions of students? What about the progress of students? How can they increase their healthy personality? How can they point out their correct thoughts? It is a matter of asking the teacher and the scholar. Moreover, they regard the position of the teacher as equal to the labor of the contract, and the sacred altar as equal to the factory of employment. There is no emotional connection between the teacher and the disciple, and the disciples treat the teacher as if they were just passers-by who happened to meet. Honesty and sincerity are not in accord on weekdays, so once a dispute arises, there is no way to eliminate it beforehand, and there is even more loss of control and guidance after the incident. Even between teachers and students, they form a confrontation, as if they were enemies. This is why the academic atmosphere is deteriorating day by day. The good and bad seedlings are left to grow on their own, so only the best talents can know themselves, strive hard, and establish themselves in a prominent way. Those of medium qualifications, once entering society, are like raw silk dyed black, and they are increasingly dark and rarely able to extricate themselves. The most cunning of them will also use their acquired intelligence as a weapon to do evil and sell favors. In this case, how can we receive the effect of education? Moreover, there are occasionally a few unscrupulous people who want to achieve their private plunder and do not hesitate to use students as a tool for their horizontal and vertical expansion, so that pure young people are daily accustomed to the conspiracy of infighting and hooking doors, and become their mechanical and treacherous evil virtues. The decline of the teacher's way has actually reached this point, then what else can we say? I have been lecturing in various schools in recent years, and I have seen these phenomena and secretly pained by them. I recall that in the era of private schools and academies, the depth of their teachers' fostering and edification was almost like the thick labor of their parents. Therefore, releasing vegetables and offering sacrifices showed the respect for the teacher's way, and private posthumous titles and heart mourning further enhanced the report of the teacher's virtue. The salary was exhausted, the fire was transmitted, and the private morality was embraced, forming its own temporary atmosphere and being able to transform the vulgar customs of the world. Scholars who maintained their character and encouraged their discipline were also countless in history. It is known that those who place importance on the influence of personality have such a great effect, and it is not said that the private schools and academies are superior to the schools.</p>
<p>If the consistent school education for more than ten years cannot prevent its students from being infected by the evil society, then education is equal to wasted consumption. If hundreds of millions of people from schools still cannot eliminate the vulgar customs of society, then society must return to destruction. We talk about the words and actions of students being noisy, but we do not think about paying attention to the influence of personality. How can we hope that the academic atmosphere will be rectified? We are worried about the mixed thoughts of young people, but we cannot strive for correct guidance. How can we hope that its trend will be upright? Today, the dignity of the teacher's way is completely exhausted. The change of Fengmeng shooting Yi has long been accustomed to the past. This is directly related to the teacher's own, and we must find ways to correct this evil wind. In recent years, school disturbances in various places have mostly been due to a small number of students who have abandoned themselves, and the lack of influence of teachers on weekdays seems to be a part of the reason. If education of young people requires the use of strict laws and decrees to correct their mistakes, then their way is already at the end, and it is what we educators should think deeply about. The past is a lesson, and the future is coming. Therefore, the future direction of education should be to balance the three aspects of imparting knowledge, cultivating personality, and leading thought, and to apply the work of potential influence in addition to lecturing and enlightening. The relationship between teachers and disciples is as close as that of family members, father and son. Since the affection and ambition are communicated, it is easy to receive. To set an example by one's own behavior and to influence them day and night, I hope that the general young students will not only have expertise in their studies, but also have roots in their morality. They will become useful materials for the country and society, and China's future will have hope. We educators can also plead not guilty to the world. Otherwise, if we continue to follow the old ways and do not change the old habits, it will not only be the bankruptcy of education, but also the country will not be the country. Even if we can raise hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and set up hundreds of more schools, what benefit will it have for the country and society? All these are common diseases of education in our country. I hope that everyone can understand this.</p>

<p>Not Removing the Courtyard Grass,齋夫 (Translator's Note: A pen name)</p>
<p>Twenty-Five</p>
<p>"Let's go outside and take a look. This temple isn't very good." Mr. Zhu said, walking towards the gate. I said, "You won't find a better place outside the temple. The village is just a bunch of thatched huts, how can they be schools? Even Zhang Huzi's house, though it has a shikumen gate, is much smaller than this old temple, definitely not suitable." Mr. Zhu said, "Let's just go take a look, it won't hurt. Zhong'er, don't be so stubborn, maybe there's a better place out there waiting for us to find it." So I led Mr. Zhu through the village. How lively! Even the young ladies and young mistresses were running to their doorways to watch, chattering like popping broad beans, saying, "That's the teacher!" The children were following behind in groups of three or five, like tails.</p>
<p>We walked to the blacksmith's shop. Li the blacksmith put down the red-hot iron and came out to greet us. Mr. Zhu smiled and said to me, "This shop is a great classroom, and Li the clerk is our teacher. We'll have to ask him for advice in the future." Li the clerk said politely, "Mr. Zhu, don't laugh at me. I'm just a rough man, what do I know? I'll need the teacher to guide me."</p>
<p>We said goodbye to Li the clerk and saw old Xu building a wall in the distance. Mr. Zhu said, "That wall-building place is also one of our classrooms, and the bricklayer clerk is also our teacher. What's that clerk's name?" "That's old Xu the bricklayer, he's the one who's against setting up a school." I told Mr. Zhu his history from beginning to end. Mr. Zhu said, "Even if he's against it, if we want to learn the principles of wall-building, we'll have to ask him."</p>
<p>Walking on, there was a large vegetable garden, and Zhao Xiao'er was watering it with manure. Xiao'er's vegetables are famous, big and tender and grow quickly. No one in the village can compare to him. Mr. Zhu said, "Zhao's vegetable garden is also one of our classrooms. Xiao'er is the teacher who teaches us how to grow vegetables."</p>
<p>Half a li from the vegetable garden was a mountain, covered with pine trees, called Wansong Ridge. There was an old pine tree on Wansong Ridge, and an old eagle was nesting on it. Mr. Zhu asked, "What is this old pine tree? And who is that old eagle?" I answered without hesitation and with complete confidence, "This old pine tree is one of our classrooms. And that old eagle is our teacher." Mr. Zhu said, "Smart Zhong'er, birds are very good architectural engineers. It is said that ancient people learned to build houses from birds. I want to ask you one more question, this place is our classroom, that place is also our classroom, so where exactly is our school?" I said, "Mr. Zhu, you've completely broken down my school. I know now what your school is in your heart. Your school has the blue sky as its roof, the earth as its floor, the twenty-eight constellations as its gates and walls, and all things are your teachers, all are your classmates, and I completely understand, all are your students. You have broken down my cage-like small school and given me a forest-like big school. How happy we are living in this vast expanse!" Mr. Zhu said, "Smart Zhong'er, you only know half of it!"</p>
<h3 id="e114">Shanghai Education After January 28th (15) <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>(Still)</p>
<p>(2) Fundamental Solutions: Speaking of the long-term plan for education in the war zone, we cannot help but recall the educational situation in various countries during the European War, which served as a wake-up call for us. When Germany was besieged on all sides and its economy was struggling, they proposed a large sum of money again in 1916 to implement the "Unified School" system, subsidize poor students to attend school, and in 1918, initiated the People's University to cultivate young laborers who lacked money and time. After the United States entered the war, the education sector became even more active, and teachers' salaries were greatly increased. In 1917, Congress passed the Smith-Hughes Act, allocating huge sums from the national treasury to subsidize vocational education. In 1918, Congress also passed the Smith-Bankhead Act, proposing to allocate 100 million yuan from the national treasury to subsidize civic and rural education. Other countries such as Britain, France, and Belgium, despite their busy military affairs, made every effort to maintain education. Although military expenditures were huge, educational funding increased rather than decreased. After the war, they further expanded their educational systems. This was all because they had foundations, funds, and supervisory boards or special accounting committees, with laws to protect them. Regardless of major political or military changes, educational funds were not allowed to be used for other purposes. We should imitate this approach so that the education sector can get on track and have hope for steady progress. This is a major key to addressing the root cause. Municipal primary schools should build excellent school buildings in the future. Looking back at the twelve municipal primary schools in Zhabei in the past, none of them owned their own buildings, and none of them had suitable playgrounds. This kind of deformed education was originally caused by historical evolution. Taking this opportunity, we should catch up quickly, select appropriate locations, purchase land and build buildings, and do practical work. We should also add secondary schools to benefit the citizens. The Mingqiang Middle School and Yates Girls' School, both private, have great buildings and good locations. It is heard that they are being shut down, which is deeply regrettable. It would be even better if the municipal government could purchase them and run them as middle schools. In the future, public schools will be the warp and private schools will be the weft of education in the war zone. Therefore, the status of private schools is also very important. It is best to merge two or three small-scale private schools to save money and improve efficiency. Since the goal is to cultivate citizens, there should be no distinctions. I believe everyone wants this. For large-scale private schools with vitality that has not been lost, their organizations should be strengthened, their content enriched, and their standards raised. Expanding on the old foundation will be smoother and easier to achieve. It is hoped that public and private cooperation will promote social education institutions. In view of the large number of traitors in this incident, there should be more supplementary schools, public schools, public education centers, and public libraries in the future. As for economic issues, we will discuss them later.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned government includes both the central and local governments because some things cannot be undertaken by the local government alone, and require the assistance of the central government. At the same time, it is especially hoped that educators and local residents will work together with the government to achieve twice the result with half the effort. It is heard that representatives from the disaster-stricken secondary schools will go to Beijing to petition, and the Shanghai Education Community's Patriotic United Association will petition the Ministry of Education for relief to schools in the Songhu war zone. Regarding this point, the reporter has two opinions: (1) Educational groups should stand together and jointly organize a "Shanghai War Zone Cultural Revival Committee," which would be organized by representatives elected from disaster-stricken cultural institutions and other educational groups. Enthusiastic individuals in education are of course also welcome to join. The most important tasks of this committee would include investigating the actual situation, formulating specific measures, raising funds, and contributing opinions to the government. (2) Instead of waiting for the public's requests, the government should proactively announce remedial measures based on the actual situation. Tongji University, Labor University, Jinan University, China Public School, Central Medical Business School, Shanghai Law School, Merchant Marine School, etc., have suffered great losses. How does the central government plan to manage them? How will ordinary private schools be subsidized to help them recover? It is hoped that good news will be announced within a few days.</p>
<p>This is also well known to everyone. Now, I am discussing this in general, hoping that everyone will recognize that today is a time of transition for education, and work together to correct the mistakes of the past and strive to create a new life for education. This is what I sincerely pray for.</p>
<p>At present, Jiangsu Province's finances are exhausted, and there are huge arrears in educational funding, which makes teachers and staff feel uneasy about their lives, and their enthusiasm for service may inevitably be dampened. This is especially true for local primary schools, where the educational life is extremely difficult. Their income is only enough to cover the cost of living, and now even this cannot be obtained. According to common sense, how can this be considered fair? It should be known that frequent natural and man-made disasters have been superimposed on each other, and the national treasury has been exhausted, which has become a widespread phenomenon throughout the country, and not only in Jiangsu Province. The social economy is bankrupt, and the lives of public officials are equally painful, and not only in the education sector. Moreover, education is incomparable to other undertakings. Today, when powerful enemies are invading and national disasters are imminent, and the Far East War is imminent, we are at the mercy of others, and the survival of the nation is at stake. If we want to save ourselves, the improvement of politics cannot be expected in a day, and the development of the economy cannot be achieved overnight. The only hope to save the country from the brink is this lifeline of education. If we do not make a spirit of sacrifice on this day, overcome all difficulties and maintain it together, then the political system will be bankrupt, the economy will be bankrupt, and education will also be bankrupt. Then we can only sit and watch the change of dynasties, the destruction of the masses, and the extinction of culture, and make the entire Chinese nation sink into the realm of beasts and insects. Therefore, we know that the key to China's survival lies in the shoulders of those engaged in education. A steadfast pine does not change its nature due to the cold winter, and only scholars can have constant virtue without constant property. Educators are the pioneers of society, so they must be able to establish their steadfast and outstanding integrity in times of hardship and distress. This is enough to show the true spirit of educators. After the European War, the German economy was plunged into the abyss of destruction, and the lives of university professors were no less difficult than ordinary laborers. They had no money to buy new shoes when they were worn out, and they sewed their own socks when they were torn. They could not afford meat even once a month, but their research and education were not abandoned because of this. Therefore, German culture, even after hundreds of battles and scars, has never declined. In a few years, it completed the great cause of revival. The ambition of our country's educators to save the country at the cost of their lives will surely not be behind others, and should not allow Germany to monopolize the glory. Today's decline in education is originally due to the fact that politics has not been put on the right track, and the chaos in politics is due to the fact that education has not been perfected. The two are mutually cause and effect, and cannot be discussed separately. Then how can we shirk our responsibilities by blaming the poor quality of politics? Since I am in charge of administration, I have also tried my best to organize local education funding and stabilize provincial funding. This should be seen by everyone. In the future, as long as I am in office, I will do my best to fulfill my responsibilities. I will also seek concrete results to alleviate the suffering of teachers and staff as much as possible, and I am unwilling to adorn myself with empty promises, and I dare not demand obligations from others unilaterally. Even my colleagues in the government recognize that education is the way to save the country and the foundation of the nation. Everything can be saved and delayed, but educational funding must be actively raised. It is only limited by economic facts that we have not been able to fully meet our expectations. This is something that cannot be helped and should be understood by everyone.</p>
<p>In short, the only way to save the country today is through education, and the way to revitalize education is for those in charge of administration and education to recognize their own responsibilities, unite sincerely, remember the difficulties of the country, have the determination to sacrifice their lives for their duties, not shirk responsibility, not give up halfway, and advance in different ways with loyalty and wisdom. Any difficulty must be overcome, and any hardship must be endured. Then, the revival of education in our country can be hoped for.</p>
<p>Although I am a member of the government, I consider myself no different from a scholar. I have never favored bureaucratic articles. What I have said here may be close to commonplace, but it is also inspired by sincerity. I hope that everyone will learn from the mistakes of education in the past and make changes, and be aware that education is the only way to save our country, and dedicate ourselves to our duties. Then, Jiangsu Province will be fortunate, and China will be fortunate. (End)</p>

<p>The entire faculty and staff of McTyeire School on Zhaofeng Road were invited by Principal Shen of the school to the Great China Restaurant on Sichuan Road yesterday to hold a supplementary celebration of Teacher's Day. During the banquet, Principal Shen Tilan gave a speech, saying that the significance of Teacher's Day includes three points: protecting status, improving treatment, and enhancing learning. However, it is slightly biased towards a passive and individualistic standpoint. In the future, we should go a step further and advocate "protecting teachers," "improving teaching," and "increasing social welfare." This is more appropriate. We hope that our colleagues in this school will make this a starting point and contribute their efforts to teachers across the country and around the world. Shen also briefly announced his school management policy, as he had just accepted the appointment of the school board, and announced that the school hopes to implement an experiment in socializing education. It is planned to start handling it in the next semester. Next, Western teacher John White briefly described his congratulations to the principal on his assumption of office, and explained the importance of school familization and emphasizing personality training. Then, teachers Sun Wenxian, Xu Hanzhang, Qiu Zitong, and others spoke successively, each expressing their hopes for the improvement of the school. Finally, the principal reported the newly revised outline of the treatment standards for teachers and staff. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>

<p>Approval of Minutes: The committee members arrived one after another at about 10:00. At 10:15, the meeting was declared open. Chairman Craigie rose to speak and instructed Secretary Langer to read the brief reports of the military attachés from various countries who went to Jiading, Wusong and other places to monitor the withdrawal of Japanese troops after the first meeting, and to inspect the handover by our side, as well as the minutes of the second meeting which discussed the issue of troop deployments in Songnan.

After the committee members considered briefly, it was declared that there were no objections and it was formally approved.</p>
<p>Issue of Complete Withdrawal: During the meeting, Chinese Committee Member Yu Hongjun asked the Chairman about the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops. The Chairman then instructed the Japanese Committee Member to reply. Japanese Committee Member Okazaki stood up and formally replied, "The Japanese naval authorities are currently in contact with the concession authorities to discuss the issue of troop deployments. Please wait another three to five days, and a decision can be made. A formal reply will be given at that time." The Chinese Committee Member continued to state that according to the ceasefire agreement, five weeks have passed since the Japanese troops began to withdraw, and they have not yet completely withdrawn. It is hoped that the Japanese side will sincerely handle the matter as soon as possible. Otherwise, our side will formally file a complaint with the meeting. The meeting adjourned at 11:10.

<p>Meeting to Be Called: After the meeting, Chinese Committee Member Yu Hongjun sent a letter to the Japanese side on the same day, stating that the Japanese troop withdrawal has not yet fulfilled the provisions of the ceasefire agreement, and has been delayed. It is hoped that Representative Okazaki will urge the military authorities to withdraw the Japanese troops from Zone J and Tongwen College as soon as possible in order to maintain friendship. Otherwise, it will be submitted to the Joint Committee for discussion. According to reports, if the Chinese side submits the matter to the committee for discussion, the Chairman may, if necessary, instruct the committee to hold a vote in accordance with the provisions of Annex 3 of the agreement, and execute the decision based on a majority vote.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Taikoo Company <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>SS Shengking Encountered Danger</p>
<p>Ran Aground in Dense Fog Near Weihaiwei</p>
<p>Two Holes in the Bow, Sea Water Rushing In</p>
<p>Crew and Passengers Completely Rescued</p>
<p>Company Sent a Tugboat to Tow</p>
<p>The new SS Shengking, a North China liner of the British Taikoo Company, encountered fog and ran aground near Weihaiwei on its way from Shanghai to Tianjin. The ship was damaged and the passengers were rescued. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Tianjin: The Taikoo Company's North China route originally had three regular passenger liners, the SS Tongzhou, SS Fengtian, and SS Shuntian, traveling between Shanghai and Tianjin. Last year, due to the age of the three ships and the excessive consumption of coal, a new ship was built by the Hong Kong factory and named the SS Shengking. It set sail from Shanghai on its maiden voyage to Tianjin on March 2nd of this year and has operated nine voyages so far. At 10:00 on Saturday morning, it departed from Shanghai carrying cargo and passengers for Tianjin. On the way near Weihaiwei, dense fog occurred and the ship ran aground on a reef.</p>
<p>Ran Aground in Dense Fog: The SS Shengking arrived at Cape Chengshanjiao in Shandong on the evening of the 12th. Dense fog had occurred on the sea surface. There were many reefs in this area, making navigation difficult. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's SS Xin Daxin Chang and SS Xin Kang also suffered accidents and sank in this area. When the SS Shengking arrived at this place, Captain Li Dexi slowed down. At 8:30, the ship reached Qingming Island, which is only fifteen nautical miles east of Weihaiwei. The fog became heavier and the channel was blocked. It ran aground on a hidden reef on Qingming Island. The hull was stuck and could not move. Two large holes were also broken on both sides of the bow, and sea water rushed into the ship, causing the ship to be in danger.</p>
<p>Captain Sought Help: After the SS Shengking had the accident, Captain Li Dexi immediately sent out a distress radio signal. The first to receive the news was the British naval warship on Liugong Island. The British naval admiral immediately dispatched two destroyers, the HMS Wallflower and HMS Keppel, and a tugboat of the naval admiral, to Qingming Island to rescue the passengers on the SS Shengking.</p>
<p>Passengers Escaped Danger: The SS Shengking carried a total of 350 passengers from Shanghai to Tianjin, including 40 foreigners and 310 Chinese. After running aground, all the passengers on the ship gathered on the deck and released sampans and life jackets in an attempt to escape. When the two British warships arrived, the naval tugboats transported 35 Westerners and 187 Chinese to the HMS Wallflower and sent them to Weihaiwei to disembark. Some Chinese passengers were still being rescued. The 26 crew members were rescued by the HMS Keppel and also sent to Weihaiwei.</p>
<p>Luggage Recovered: At 7:30 yesterday morning, the Shanghai head office received a telegram about the SS Shengking accident, which only said that the ship had run aground and the passengers were safe. After the company telegraphed to inquire about the cause, it received a reply in the afternoon stating that all passengers had been rescued to Weihaiwei, and each person's luggage had also been transferred to Weihaiwei. It is heard that all the mail and other items have also been unloaded, and there should be no losses.</p>
<p>Protection and Transportation of Passengers: The company urgently telegraphed the SS Fengtian, which was en route in North China, yesterday to rush to Weihaiwei to load the rescued passengers and send them to Tianjin. As the SS Shengking had a lot of cargo loaded in Shanghai, mainly piece goods and tea, and the ship ran aground and was not immediately out of danger, it was agreed with the British Navy to send a destroyer to berth there for protection.</p>
<p>Towing the Hull: There are two holes in the bow of the SS Shengking, and the sea water has flooded the hold. Therefore, the cargo in the bow hold has been damaged by water and the losses are quite heavy. However, the hull is stranded on the reef and can only be towed out when the tide rises. The company was extremely busy yesterday handling the rescue work and sent the SS Ningbo to sail from Shanghai to the accident site today to handle towing and other work.</p>
<p>Overview of the Vessel: The SS Shengking was newly built last year and came to Shanghai from the dock in February of this year. It has only been operating for nine voyages. The ship is well constructed, with a length of 300 feet, a width of 46 feet, and a load capacity of 3,000 tons. The construction cost of the ship and the layout of each cabin is worth 1 million yuan, making it the best and fastest ship currently sailing in North China.</p>
<p>SS Shuntian Startled: This time, the SS Shuntian, which was coming from Tianjin to Shanghai, also suffered a major danger when passing through the waters of Cape Chengshanjiao. According to the crew of the ship, the SS Shuntian was in the middle of the night when it arrived at Cape Chengshanjiao, and there was also dense fog on the sea. A Japanese ship came head-on without sounding its whistle. When it was discovered, it was only more than ten yards away. The two ships were traveling on the same straight line. The captain of the SS Shuntian was startled and quickly reversed the engine. Fortunately, the action was quick and he was able to avoid it. If he had been a minute late, the two ships would have collided and sunk. Afterwards, a lot of sea water was pumped out of the ship. Even thinking about it now is frightening.</p>
<p>Reuters Weihaiwei 13th: The naval tugboat SS Saint Breock towed a cargo ship with coolie workers at 2 pm today to assist the SS Shengking in unloading cargo. The SS Huizhou is now berthed next to the SS Shengking, awaiting the arrival of the SS Fengtian from Tanggu. The cargo ship towed by the SS Saint Breock will unload cargo from the SS Shengking and transport it to the SS Fengtian, while the SS Huizhou will carry the passengers of the SS Shengking to Tanggu. The weather is good at the moment, but the fog has not yet cleared.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Both China Merchants Bureau and Butterfield &amp; Swire Deny Taking Out Loans <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Kwok Wen News Agency reports: Yesterday, various newspapers in this city carried reports about the China Merchants Bureau borrowing 30 million yuan from the American firm Butterfield &amp; Swire to reorganize its affairs. Yesterday, reporters inquired about this matter from various parties, and it was found that the facts were quite different from what was reported. Both the China Merchants Bureau and Butterfield &amp; Swire have denied the loan. The following is a record of the statements from both parties and the details of the matter:</p>
<p>Li Guojie's Statement: After the news was published in various newspapers yesterday, reporters rushed to Li Guojie, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, to inquire. Mr. Li denied the report, saying that since he took office, the reorganization plan of the bureau has been in its initial stages. Although the China Merchants Bureau needs a large sum of 30 million yuan, it has not been carried out due to various reasons since he took office. The reports in the newspapers are either rumors or inaccurate.</p>
<p>Butterfield &amp; Swire's Denial: The reporter went to Butterfield &amp; Swire at 3 Guangdong Road and requested to see the company's manager to inquire about the matter. The reply was that in this time of global commercial depression, the existing business is already overwhelming, and the company denies lending 30 million yuan to the China Merchants Bureau and declares that it is a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Once Had Such a Proposal: The idea of the China Merchants Bureau taking out a loan has been around since the time of Zhao Tieqiao. After Zhao was murdered, the matter was shelved. When Li Zhonggong was appointed as commissioner, he suggested taking out a loan to the Ministry of Communications, but it was not successful because the conditions were not met. When Guo Waifeng succeeded Li as commissioner, someone also suggested it to Mr. Guo, but Mr. Guo did not dare to act rashly because he thought it was a big matter. When Chen Fumu continued as supervisor, the Ministry of Communications, in view of the China Merchants Bureau's heavy debt burden and inability to develop its business, recently had the idea of taking out a loan. It is rumored that although there are major industrialists willing to invest, it has not yet become a reality because the conditions are not right.</p>
<p>Adding Shipping Routes Also Inaccurate: The Kwok Wen News Agency reports that it has been widely rumored recently that the China Merchants Bureau Steamship Company plans to borrow 30 million yuan from the American firm Butterfield &amp; Swire Steamship Company to repay debts and expand its shipping fleet. A reporter from the Kwok Wen News Agency specially visited Mr. Li Guojie, the general manager of the bureau, yesterday to ask if this was true. Mr. Li said that he did not know where this news came from and that he had no knowledge of it. He is now investigating the matter after seeing it in the newspaper and hopes that the public will not believe it. It is also reported that the bureau has purchased two Norwegian merchant ships and plans to officially start operating them at the beginning of next month, adding shipping routes to Southeast Asia. This is also inaccurate because the two ships, "Hai Rui" and "Hai Xiang," were purchased last year as cargo ships and cannot carry passengers. They have been transporting goods for a long time (with no fixed routes). All ships will have new schedules when the situation becomes peaceful and the transportation of troops is over, and it is not just for the above two ships.</p>

<p>A Portion Stayed in Wuxi for Training to Go to the Border to Fight the Enemy</p>
<p>Wang Pingnan, a member of the Volunteer Army Committee of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation and the second captain of the Volunteer Army Student Regiment accompanying the 19th Route Army, led the army back to Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Wang, the second team has 234 volunteers, including 53 who volunteered to go to the Northeast to help eliminate the Japanese invaders. They are currently staying in Wuxi, led by Captain Li Xiangheng, to continue training under Brigade Commander Weng. The first team of university students and the second team of the Nanjing Iron Blood Corps also have 50 to 60 people staying in Wuxi. As soon as the transportation question is solved, they will set off north. After the volunteer army of this team (the second team) returned to Shanghai, those from nearby and neighboring provinces left on their own. There are still 53 people from Sichuan and Guangdong, and 97 people from the first and third teams, who are unable to return to their hometowns because of the long distance, road obstruction, and lack of travel funds. Although they remain in Shanghai, their situation is very difficult. After graduating on June 10, the first and third teams were given four yuan each by Brigade Commander Weng, and the second team was given ten yuan each by the Citizens' Federation, but this was not enough for the long journey. Chen Qianfu is now running around to appeal to the Sichuan and Guangdong associations and other patriotic organizations to raise travel funds so that the patriotic volunteers will not suffer the hardships of being stranded in a foreign land because of their dedication to fighting against Japan.</p>

<p>Invites Directors for the Aviation National Salvation Association</p>
<p>Huang Bingheng, Director of the Aviation Department, sent letters to Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and others yesterday, inviting them to serve as directors of the Aviation National Salvation Association. The original letter said: "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai, the people at home and overseas Chinese compatriots all believe that to save the country and resist foreign aggression, we must rely on the development of aviation. They have urged the government to establish an Aviation National Salvation Association in the shortest possible time to lead the public to assist the government in striving for the development of aviation and the enrichment of air defense. We admire the patriotic sentiment. After our department transferred this case to the National Government, it immediately designated a commissioner to discuss and examine the rules and regulations, and drafted the draft charter of the China Aviation National Salvation Association, which is planned to be submitted for promulgation and implementation. According to the charter, the General Assembly should have a number of directors, who will be appointed by the National Government from those who are highly respected in all sectors of the country. We have long admired your reputation and enthusiasm for public welfare. If you are willing to take the lead, the association's work will surely prosper. In addition to submitting the National Government to invite you as a director, we will send Lin Wojiang, a member of the Legal System Committee of our department, to visit and explain the details. We hope that you will understand the difficulties of the times and agree to this. Aviation will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. Sincerely wish you all the best.

<p>Jianghuai: The Jianghuai Fellow Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the National Government yesterday: "To Chairman Jiang and President Wang of the National Government: News reports that the Jiangsu Provincial Pacification Commissioner's Office has been closed. The Jiangbei area has always been plagued by bandits, but fortunately, Pacification Commissioner Zhang has been effective in suppressing them, which has allowed them to be slightly restrained. However, due to years of famine and hardship, the people are suffering, and bandits are taking the opportunity to launch attacks. If the Pacification Commissioner's Office is withdrawn, we fear that the bandits will act recklessly and cause endless harm. Therefore, we dare to convey the public opinion and telegram to Your Excellencies, hoping that you will take into consideration the public opinion and postpone the withdrawal to pacify the area and satisfy the people's wishes. We are eagerly awaiting your orders. The Jianghuai Fellow Association in Shanghai."</p>

Gaoyou was hit by floods last year, and thanks to Pacification Commissioner Zhang's active rescue efforts, countless dying people were saved. Later, when the bandits became more rampant, he spared no effort to eliminate them, so that the people could live in peace. If it is abolished now, we fear that the bandits will rise again, and the survivors will be subjected to another catastrophe. We respectfully request that you withdraw the order. We represent the people of Gaoyou and beg you to reconsider. The Gaoyou Fellow Association."</p>

<p>Requests the National Government to Exempt Taxes in the Disaster Area</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Reconstruction Committee in the disaster area of this city, in view of the fact that the Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong areas suffered a great disaster after the Shanghai Incident, in order to maintain the recovery of industry and commerce in the disaster area, specially submitted a document to the National Government yesterday, requesting that all taxes in the disaster area be exempted to alleviate the people's suffering. The original document stated: "We are submitting this request to exempt taxes in the disaster area to alleviate industry and commerce. Unfortunately, our country is plagued by floods and droughts, and bandits are everywhere. All industries are suffering, and internal wars are frequent. The sound of gunfire is everywhere, and the people are not living. The government is already exhausting all its resources, and taxes and miscellaneous fees are increasing endlessly. The state is doing its utmost to drain the pond to get all the fish, and the people are suffering more and more. In recent years, industry and commerce have been declining, and the state of hardship is indescribable. Since the January 28th Incident, the Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong areas have been reduced to battlefields, with scars everywhere and scorched earth. It is unknown when they will recover. The Shanghai authorities, in order to relieve the suffering, have established the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee and other organizations, which have been established for two weeks. However, we have only seen the empty words of proclamations and have not received any practical relief. We lament the suffering of our industry and commerce. The current hardships are as such, and the future disasters are still not over. We dare to appeal to Your Excellency to exempt all national taxes first to alleviate the suffering and leave a glimmer of hope for industry and commerce. It is also to protect the foundation of China and preserve the livelihood of the people. We respectfully request that you examine and approve our request and order its implementation to help industry and commerce. This will be fortunate for the public. We respectfully submit to the National Government."</p>

<p>The Capitalist Side Agreed to Pay Retirement Funds</p>
<p>Workers Want to Resume Work</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, in view of the prolonged dispute over the closure of the Sanyou Factory, which has lasted for four months without a resolution, specially sent staff member Yuan Shenglu to convene a meeting with representatives of the Sanyou Union yesterday afternoon. Wang Bing, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Xia Zhongzhao and Gong Liangshi, representatives of the Sanyou Union, were present. The representative of the Municipal Government stated that the capitalist side of Sanyou did not intend to resume work and did not formally announce the dismissal, but agreed to pay one month's salary as retirement funds, and promised to give priority to hiring them when the factory reopens. After listening to the statement, the union representatives said that the capitalist's move was unexpected and was actually a deliberate oppression of the workers. Since there were so many retirement funds to dismiss the workers, why did they claim that they did not have enough funds to resume business? Their intentions were self-evident, so they declared their rejection and asked the authorities to order the capitalist side to maintain the workers' livelihood and resume work as soon as possible to prevent the dispute from escalating.</p>

<p>Temporary General Meeting: The strike committee held a temporary emergency meeting at the Tongshang Hotel on Avenyue Road at 10:00 p.m. the day before yesterday and decided: (1) Some members of the strike committee will be dismissed immediately due to their poor performance and will be reorganized. New members will be elected to supplement the committee, and the total number will remain at 21; (2) Improve the organization of the strike committee; (3) Adopt effective measures to negotiate with the company again; (4) All workers will gather at the New Central Bank on Fujian Road on the morning of the 13th to urge the company to reply; (5) Protest against the company's notice to the workers.</p>
<p>Urging Reply: At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the striking workers were ordered to gather at the New Central Bank on Fujian Road to urge the company to officially reply to the conditions. However, because of the small number of participants and the absence of responsible personnel from the company, the gathering was stopped and a meeting was held at the Zaichun Pavilion on Zhejiang Road. It was decided: (1) to expand the strike organization; (2) to hold a general meeting of all workers on Heard Road at 2:00 p.m. to solicit the opinions of the workers and then decide on the course of action.</p>
<p>Strictly Abide by Discipline: After the company issued a notice to the workers, the strike committee specially issued a notice to all workers yesterday morning, stating: "For the notice, the attitude of the capitalist side towards the conditions we have put forward is extremely tough and has obviously broken down. It is necessary to continue the strike. All workers are not allowed to go to work and must abide by discipline. Anyone who violates this privately will be punished by this court in accordance with the law and will not be forgiven." To all workers, the strike committee court secretariat. (The strike discipline is as follows: (1) No one is allowed to go to work privately without the order of the strike committee; (2) No one except the representatives sent by the strike committee may negotiate with the capitalist side; (3) Obey the command and orders of the strike committee. Anyone who violates the above discipline will be treated as a traitor.</p>
<p>Protest Today: Subsequently, because the former police station of Jinan University prohibited the assembly, the meeting could not be held. Therefore, the strike committee was reorganized and decided: At 10:00 a.m. today, each department of the nine branches, including the General Company on Jiangxi Road, the Fujian Road, Haining Road, Yidingpan Road, Mintiniyin Road, and Yangshupu branches, will send one representative, together with three representatives from the presidium of the strike committee, to the company to protest to the manager and urge him to reply to the conditions.</p>
<p>Emergency Notice: The strike committee issued a notice to all workers yesterday: (1) Tomorrow (the 14th), each branch and department must convene a mass meeting, and the presidium can send a person in charge to attend and report. Please inform Zhu Jun of the meeting time and location determined by the responsible representatives of each branch and department by 9:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 14th); (2) The presidium has decided to submit a letter of protest to the capitalist side at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 14th) and urge it to reply to the conditions. We hope that each branch and department will quickly send one representative to set off together with the representatives designated by the presidium. All representatives must gather here by 9:00 a.m. tomorrow; (3) The disciplinary committee must perform its duties in accordance with the order of the temporary general meeting from today onwards.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Protest: The Telephone Workers' Strike Committee protested the telephone company's notice to the workers as follows: (1) The company said, "The strike was not notified to the company in advance" and "The company is willing to discuss any issues raised in accordance with the company's procedures." These are lies to deceive the workers and cover up the truth. Last year, the workers submitted 18 requests to the company and asked them to discuss and reply, but the company ignored them. This year, the foreman asked the workers to sign their names, requesting the company to increase wages, but there was no reply. Recently, they asked to restore the jobs of the dismissed workers, but the company ignored them. The company completely does not take Chinese workers into account and is unwilling to discuss the workers' problems. Therefore, the workers have learned a lesson and have no way out but to resort to the means of strike to deal with the company and solve the workers' own problems. Therefore, the responsibility for the strike and the responsibility for sacrificing public convenience should be entirely borne by the company, and the workers cannot bear any responsibility; (2) "The internal reorganization plan of the company" is to cancel Sunday pay, Sunday rest, and wages are paid as usual. Working on Sundays, wages are doubled. It used to be like this, what "reorganization plan" is going to cancel the regulations for working on Sundays and doubling wages. The company wants the workers to work on Sundays without doubling their wages. This is just forced labor. The so-called "reorganization plan" is just a plan to attack the workers twice as much; (3) "The company's workers' salaries in April will not increase due to business relations." The company "due to business relations" (note that it is not that the company lost money, but that the business is going to make a lot of money), can increase the price of telephones, reduce the workers' wages, and dismiss the workers, all of which are "legitimate." Workers ask for a little wage increase because prices have risen and they can't fill their stomachs, which is an "unreasonable" request. Workers are dismissed and have no food to eat, and they ask for a little retirement money, which is also an "unreasonable" request. This is just sophistry. Such "legitimacy" and "truth" are just another name for oppressing the workers; (4) "The company did not deduct pension money and savings money." But when the company dismisses workers, it always uses various excuses. In fact, most of it is deducted. We firmly oppose deducting workers' savings in any way; (5) "The company is undergoing a reorganization plan," "It must dismiss a large number of workers." We firmly oppose the company's "reorganization plan" to oppress and sacrifice workers. We demand the protection of workers' lives and interests. We are completely legitimate; (6) "The strike is instigated by a small number of bad elements, and the workers are being fooled." This is slander and insult to the workers, and it is a poisonous trick to split the workers. Old pigs also resist when they are oppressed. Our workers are not even as good as old pigs. When we are oppressed to the point where we cannot breathe, we do not know to rise up and resist. The workers are all wooden heads who only know how to be fooled. When they are hungry, they don't even know to eat. The imperialist capitalists look down on the Chinese people even more than pigs. Three thousand workers strike unanimously and insist on striking. This is an iron fact. The workers will not fall for the capitalists' tricks. They are united to fight for their demands and resolutely support their leaders. They will fight the capitalists to the end so that the imperialists dare not underestimate the Chinese people. We must fight for our own interests and also fight for the dignity of the Chinese nation. The company is still unwilling to discuss the three conditions with the workers today and refuses to meet with the workers' representatives. It has no sincerity in resolving the strike. The company should bear the responsibility for the extension of the strike and the impact on the public's convenience. We hope that all sectors of society will warn the capitalists to reply to the workers' conditions and resolve the strike as soon as possible, and give the workers sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>Foreman Was Beaten: When the telephone workers unanimously insisted on striking, a certain foreman was recruited by the capitalist side to gather workers and go to work privately. The workers were very angry. Dozens of workers surrounded and beat him yesterday evening, causing him serious injuries. It is reported that the company has sent the foreman to the hospital and dare not recruit workers to start work again.</p>
<p>Notice to Workers: The Shanghai Telephone Company Workers' Strike Committee's notice to workers: "All workers, we have been on strike for six days to oppose the company's dismissal, demand increased wages, and retirement funds. The capitalist not only did not reply to our conditions, but also dismissed twelve of our workers. The capitalist said, 'The strike was not notified to the company in advance,' and 'The company manager is happy to discuss the workers' problems with the workers.' These are lies. In the past, we signed and submitted to the company, but the company completely ignored us and did not discuss it. Therefore, we had to use strike to oppose the capitalist. The capitalist does not treat us workers as human beings. He is preparing to starve us workers to death. He does not talk to our representatives. Can we still tolerate such oppression and insult from the capitalist? We must use our blood to fight the capitalist to the death. The strike committee calls on the workers to insist on striking to the end. We swear not to go to work if the capitalist does not agree to our conditions. The capitalist has sent traitors and lackeys everywhere to spread rumors and notify the workers to go to work. Workers, do not listen to the capitalist's rumors. Beat the traitors and lackeys. Lackeys have also been found in the presidium of the strike committee. At the presidium meeting yesterday, Weng Zhenhua, Chen Zherong, and Pan Mou proposed three resolutions: (1) As long as the capitalist agrees to 'recognize the trade union' and Sunday work, they can go to work. The articles on wage increases, job security, and retirement funds are no longer needed; (2) Go to the Kuomintang to petition for mediation; (3) Dismiss committee member Ye Gongxing. Workers, we must insist on striking until we win the conditions before we go to work, but the members of the presidium, Chen et al., want to go to work and sacrifice the workers' conditions. We want the representatives of the strike committee to directly negotiate with the capitalists for a solution because the result of asking someone to mediate the postal and newspaper strikes was the failure of the strike, with no conditions and many workers arrested. We do not want the strike to be the same as the postal and newspaper strikes, so we oppose mediation, but they insist on asking the Kuomintang to mediate. Ye Gongxing, as a representative, works hard for the workers. Only the police and capitalists oppose Ye Gongxing, arrest him, but Weng Chen et al. want to dismiss Ye Gongxing. Workers, is this not the action of traitors and lackeys? Can such a presidium lead us to victory in the strike? Absolutely not. Therefore, the representative assembly held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon, unanimously denied the above resolutions passed by the presidium, reorganized the presidium, dismissed all the positions of Weng Zhenhua, Chen Zherong, Pan Mou, etc., and re-elected Ye Gongxing and other eleven people to form the presidium, leading the workers to fight to the end and win the conditions. The new presidium is willing to use their lives and leadership to fight for the victory of the strike. Everyone must obey the orders of the strike committee and support the strike committee to fight together. We are not just acting on emotion. Because the old presidium wants to sell out the workers, we must fight for the victory of the strike, and we must drive them out. Driving them out will not reduce our strength, but will make our unity more consolidated and our leadership stronger. Workers, unite, overthrow the lackeys, insist on striking, and victory is ours. Shanghai Telephone Company Strike Committee, June 13."</p>

<p>Negotiations with the Company Scheduled for Today</p>
<p>Union Declares Negotiation Will Follow Legal Procedures</p>
<p>Even if Negotiations Break Down, There Will Be No Strike</p>
<p>All workers of the machinery department of the French Water and Electricity Company, after a meeting, have decided to make three demands and negotiate with the company. The situation is serious. The union has scheduled negotiations with the manager today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Demands Proposed The second session of the Water and Electricity Workers' Union, after a general meeting, resolved: (1) Regarding the request for the company to restore the monthly subsidy of 200 yuan for the union's operating expenses, it was resolved to entrust the board of directors to be responsible for negotiating with the company. (2) Regarding the request for the reinstatement of 21 workers who were suspended by the company on September 5th of last year due to a wiring conflict, it was resolved to entrust the board of directors to request the company to handle the case together. (3) Regarding the serious illness of former union executive Xu A'mei in prison, it was resolved to entrust the board of directors to find a way to proceed with legal bail and request the company to prove that she is not a communist.</p>
<p>Negotiations Today Yesterday, a union director declared to the New Voice News reporter that news reports in foreign newspapers about French Water and Electricity workers preparing to strike and the intention to strike having been in place for many days are completely inaccurate. The demands proposed by the union after a meeting are scheduled for the 14th. The board of directors will send Zou Dexin, Zhao Kunxiang, Lu Zhihong, Lu Guanhong, and four other representatives to negotiate with the company's new manager, Gu Qiya. If the company refuses to negotiate, then we will definitely adopt legal procedures and submit a request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters to handle it in accordance with the law. We will definitely not use strike tactics to deal with the company and cause significant losses to both parties.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Fujian Relief Association Telegraphs for a Thorough Reform of Fujian Politics <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams Sent to the Central Government and the Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army Yesterday</p>
<p>The United Association of Fujian Associations in Shanghai previously sent representatives to the capital to petition the central government to send troops to Fujian to suppress the communists, which was satisfactorily resolved. The central government has already dispatched the 19th Route Army to Fujian. The association believes that suppressing the communists should not rely solely on military force, and that Fujian's politics should be thoroughly reformed. After days of discussion, the association decided on the general principles of national salvation. Yesterday, telegrams were sent to the central government and Jiang, the commander-in-chief of the 19th Route Army, and Cai, the army commander. Excerpts from the two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to Beijing To Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, The people of Fujian have suffered from communist bandits for a long time. Now that the central government has dispatched the 19th Route Army to Fujian to suppress the communists, the people are cheering and extremely encouraged. However, bandits are rampant throughout Fujian Province. The reason for this is that the provincial government authorities have historically used the buying off of bandits to build their personal power, leading to the proliferation of mixed troops everywhere, intensifying the communist bandit atmosphere, and deepening the poisoning. This time, the central government is concerned about the people's difficulties and determined to eliminate the bandits. It is the expectation of the people of Fujian, both inside and outside the province. We believe that to eliminate bandits, we must do our best and eradicate evil completely. For Fujian's politics, we must thoroughly reform, remove the accumulated ills of Fujian Province, and bring clarity to politics, so as to eliminate the scourge of bandits and relieve the people's distress. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Telegram to Fujian To Director Jiang of the Fujian Pacification Commissioner's Office and Army Commander Cai of the 19th Route Army, The Fujian bandits are rampant. We are grateful for your command of the elite forces to relieve the people's suffering. The people of Fujian, both inside and outside the province, celebrate your heroic name. Our province is unfortunate to have suffered from the scourge of bandits for a long time, in deep water and scorching fire. However, tracing its origin, it is due to the corruption of politics and the provincial government authorities using the buying off of bandits to build their personal power, leading to the intensification of the bandit atmosphere and the lack of peaceful days for the people. The opportunity for communist disaster is hidden in this. We believe that the army of bandit style in Fujian Province, if not thoroughly eradicated, will leave endless troubles. We specially request your consideration to live up to the high expectations of the 30 million people of Fujian.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Anti-Drug Association Requests <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Executive Yuan to Announce Anti-Opium Stance</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, based on recent investigations and reports in various newspapers, has learned that the central authorities, facing financial exhaustion and helplessness, are vigorously promoting the public sale of opium and are determined to implement it. Yesterday, the association sent a telegram to Wang Jingwei, the president of the Executive Yuan, inquiring about the truth of the matter and requesting a clear announcement of the anti-opium stance. At the same time, the association sent a telegram to national public organizations and party headquarters at all levels, calling on them to jointly advocate against opium. The telegram is recorded as follows: "Most urgent, To Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, Since the past two months, the central government has been planning the public sale of opium, and rumors have been rampant, causing public discontent. Our association has repeatedly inquired of your esteemed Yuan through letters and telegrams to ascertain the truth. Furthermore, believing that the current National Government, which takes the people's will as its center and has been baptized by the Three Principles of the People, would never go so far as to implement the public sale of opium, we dared not believe the rumors from near and far. Unexpectedly, unfortunate facts have suddenly come to light. According to yesterday's Shanghai Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, the central government, facing financial exhaustion and helplessness, is determined to implement the public sale of opium. Yesterday evening, the Shanghai Da Wan Bao and this morning's Shen Bao also published similar news. Upon reading these reports, we were shocked and ashamed. According to Premier Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug instructions, "The war against opium must never be compromised or abandoned. If the responsible government agency, for its own convenience and immediate interests, lowers the flag and ceases the war against opium, no matter how brief, it is an act of treason." This shows that opium is an item that Premier Sun Yat-sen detested and resolutely rejected, and it is also regarded as a deadly enemy by the people. However, the central financial authorities have been thinking about it day and night, coveting it for a long time, and using various tricks to seek its implementation. Our association has sent many letters and telegrams, but your esteemed Yuan has not replied, and the situation can be imagined. Recently, Liu Ruiheng, chairman of the Anti-Opium Committee, has opposed the immediate prohibition and advocated a gradual prohibition, and Finance Minister Song Ziwen has resolutely resigned. Rumors have also spread that these are closely related to the public sale of opium. Now, reading the above-mentioned news reports, it seems to have been confirmed. The people of the whole country feel uneasy and at a loss because they have not received a clear reply from your esteemed Yuan. Our association, therefore, represents the public opinion and sends another telegram to inquire and express our views. If the central government is determined to proceed without considering the alternatives, the people will swear to oppose it to the death and will never surrender. Our association is determined to fight against drugs and will fight to the end. We earnestly request your esteemed Yuan to provide a concrete reply as soon as possible to dispel public opinion. We await your instructions with utmost urgency. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, respectfully, Yuan Yin."</p>

<h3 id="e150">Harbor Quarantine Station <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Third Cholera Weekly Report</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Liande of the Harbor Quarantine Station released the third cholera weekly report yesterday (the 13th), stating: (1) The cholera situation in Shanghai in the past week (up to June 11) was similar to the previous week. After bacteriological examination, there were a total of 90 patients (including 90 deaths). A brief summary is as follows: A. Shanghai Number of patients Number of deaths</p>
<p>Chinese area 52 7</p>
<p>Public Concession 29 1</p>
<p>French Concession 9 1</p>
<p>Total 90 9</p>
<p>Total in the previous week 190 23 Total number of cases this year 280 22</p>
<p>B. Shanghai Epidemic Hospital 64 2</p>
<p>Emergency Epidemic Hospital 12 4</p>
<p>Public Shanghai Hospital 6 2</p>
<p>IC Isolation Hospital 8 2</p>
<p>Total 90 9</p>
<p>(2) Cholera has also been discovered in other Chinese ports. A) An American expatriate in Qufu, who came from Shanghai, arrived on June 6, fell ill the next day, and died that evening. B) Cholera was first discovered in Nanjing on May 18. As of June 4, there were a total of 20 patients (including 12 deaths). (3) Following the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, Hong Kong also announced on June 8 that Shanghai was an infected port, and Japan had a similar announcement on June 9. (4) The Shanghai Port Quarantine Administration notified the various port authorities on June 9 that they should simultaneously prevent the invasion of cholera from Shanghai. These ports include Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Qufu, Qinhuangdao, Tanggu, Tianjin, Andong, and Yingkou. (5) The Chinese Red Cross Society has established the First Cholera Alert Hospital on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, which can accommodate 300 people, and the Second Cholera Hospital on Mei Baike Road, which can accommodate 150 people. In addition, there is the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital, located on Tangshan Road in Hongkou (between Gongping Road and Dengtuo Road), which can accommodate 500 patients. (6) Two notable cases of cholera patients are briefly described below. A. Mrs. Xu, female, 40 years old, four months pregnant, suffered from severe vomiting and diarrhea. On June 9, she sought treatment at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road. After being admitted to the hospital, she was given saline injections, which greatly reduced her pain. The next day, she had a miscarriage. According to the patient, she is still recovering in the hospital. After bacteriological examination, it was confirmed that she had genuine cholera. (7) The Central Committee for the Prevention of Cholera convenes weekly meetings of the health authorities of the Chinese and Concession areas at the Harbor Quarantine Station to discuss publicity work and investigate the source of the disease. These meetings are held in rotation. As a result of last month's meeting, cholera films can be shown in various theaters. Preventive vaccination work is still being carried out as usual. (8) The issue of drinking water for the poor is an urgent matter at the moment and is being addressed to improve the situation. There are a total of four tap water plants in Shanghai:</p>
<p>A. Shanghai City Nanshi Water Plant, capable of serving 500,000 people.</p>
<p>Wusong Water Plant, capable of serving 1.5 million people.</p>
<p>The cost is 50 cents per 1,000 gallons.</p>
<p>B. Public Concession Yangshupu Water Plant, capable of serving 1.5 million people.</p>
<p>The cost is 62.5 cents per 1,000 gallons.</p>
<p>C. French Concession Nanshi Water Plant, capable of serving 600,000 people.</p>
<p>The cost is 59 cents per 1,000 gallons. (9) The most disadvantaged can only use unclean water from nearby rivers, wells, and ponds. Even those who do not use it for drinking often use it to wash clothes, utensils, and food. Therefore, the occurrence of cholera is an important reason. (10) The French Concession has public tap water pipes that are free of charge. The Public Concession does not have this kind of facility. Tap water pipes should be installed in places with clean drinking water, and the public should be supplied with it. The public should also be persuaded to use it. Recent observations show that cholera is only widespread in Shanghai this year, and other ports may also be spared.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Penglai Market Exhibition of Native Cloth <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Farmers' Education Hall is holding an exhibition to promote native cloth. For several days, it has been touring the districts of Zhuanqiao, Minhang, and Maqiao in turn. Today (the 14th) is the date for the exhibition to be held in Shanghai. The hall has specially borrowed the Penglai Market in Nanshi as the venue. It is reported that the cloth selected from various districts has more than 2,000 varieties of colors and patterns, and it is especially attractive when placed in glass trees. There are also handwoven cloths made by a seventy-year-old woman and an unmarried girl, which are rare. To facilitate visitors, the hall has also set up a retail department and an order department, where purchases can be made at any time. The price of the cheaper cloth is only a little over one yuan per piece. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will visit the exhibition.</p>
<h3 id="e152">No Bids for County Slaughter Tax <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County slaughter tax was previously contracted by contractor Wang Shoumei for 4,516.60 yuan. The one-year term expired in May of this year. It has been found that this tax is allocated for the special provincial education fund. The Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office has announced a call for merchants to bid for the contract, and Committee Member Wu Jiaxu has been sent to Shanghai to handle the matter in conjunction with the county government. However, since the announcement of the call for bids on June 2, no one has obtained a certificate to bid. The original opening of bids was scheduled for the day before yesterday, but it did not happen. Therefore, in addition to ordering the original contractor Wang Shoumei to continue to collect and remit the tax according to the quota to avoid suspension, the county government, together with Committee Member Wu, reported to the Education Funding Management Office yesterday to request instructions on how to proceed.</p>

<h3 id="e153">After Three Deaths from Shell Explosion <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Old Mother Dies Upon Hearing News</p>
<p>Jiang Luoshi Escapes Death</p>
<p>How Will Huang Qian Face His Old Mother in the Afterlife?</p>
<p>Cantonese Chen Guojun, Huang Qian, and their fellow villager Mr. Ye jointly rented a tailor shop at No. 531 and a half Hongan Lane, Bazilu, and lived in the front wing room on the ground floor. The rear wing room was rented to Cantonese young women Liang Shengyu and Jiang Luoshi. At 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Chen, Huang, and Ye, having nothing to do, went to Zhabei to visit the war ruins. On the way back, they picked up a shell with a diameter of about two and a half inches and brought it home. After dinner, Chen took out the shell and fondled it. The men and women living together gathered around to watch. Only Jiang Luoshi had deeper insight and believed that such dangerous items should not be treated as toys to avoid causing disaster. She repeatedly asked Chen to find a way to discard it. However, Chen did not listen to good advice, and the others also ridiculed her for being overly concerned. Therefore, although the speaker spoke earnestly, the listeners despised her. Seeing that honest advice was unwelcome, Jiang Luoshi went to bed. As soon as she got into bed, she suddenly heard a loud bang, and disaster struck. After Jiang Luoshi went out, Chen and the others continued to fondle and stroke the shell even more. Chen accidentally dropped the shell on the ground, and it exploded instantly. When Jiang Luoshi came out again, she saw that the three men and one woman who had been watching were all injured and lying on the ground, covered in blood and flesh. The scene was unbearable. Chen Guojun and Huang Qian were the most seriously injured and were killed on the spot. Mr. Ye and Liang Shengyu were still alive. Jiang Luoshi reported to the Hongkou police station and the relatives of the dead and injured. Soon, Chinese and foreign detectives and Chen's younger brother Guochang and Huang's cousin Qicong arrived. After the detectives inquired about the cause of the accident, they sent Mr. Ye to Tongren Hospital and Liang Shengyu to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The bodies of Chen and Huang were taken to the Filen Road morgue. However, Liang died before receiving treatment after arriving at the hospital. The hospital notified the police station, which sent detectives to the morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court sent prosecutor Li Ying to the morgue to examine the bodies and question them. The court ordered Chen's body to be handed over to his younger brother Chen Guochang, Huang's body to his cousin Huang Qicong, and Liang's body to her friend Chen Jiangshi, who signed guarantees to take them away for burial. However, Huang Qian's mother, who lived on Kangnao Road, was old. That night, she suddenly heard the shocking news and mourned the untimely death of her son. She wanted to rush to the scene of the accident, but she was too old to do so. Therefore, her crying became even more sorrowful. Unexpectedly, she died of grief. It was truly tragic. Now, the police station believes that such tragedies have occurred frequently after the war. It is due to ignorant and foolish people causing their own disasters. It is hoped that the general public will learn from the past and not lightly pick up explosive objects. They should report to the nearest police station to have them destroyed to avoid future troubles.</p>
<p>Yan Yutang Case</p>
<p>Kidnappers Interrogation Record</p>
<p>Ye Xianglian Has No Involvement</p>
<p>Kidnappers' Furniture Confiscated</p>
<p>After Yan Yutang of Dalong Iron Factory, Meilun Textile Factory, and Guangyu Business Company was kidnapped, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and Inspector Liu Shaokui of the General Patrol and Inspection Office, together with all the detectives, rescued Yan at No. 72 Pushi Road and arrested six kidnappers, Wang Jian, Kong Ali, Chen Huiqing, Chen Xiaosi, Yang Jingzhai, and Ye Xianglian, confiscated three box cannons, one poison gas pistol, and more than 140 bullets, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye opened the court to continue the interrogation. The defendants jointly hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. The police lawyer Ru Baohui then stated that he requested that the defendant Ye Xianglian be released first because she had no involvement in the case. The court approved the request. Lawyer Ru continued that after the police solved the case, they found that No. 72 Pushi Road was rented by Yu Ziying, who is now on the run. Many of his belongings were left behind, and the police sent officers to guard them. He requested that the court make a decision on how to dispose of them. Furthermore, the guarantor for the house at No. 72, Xu Shengquan, lives at No. 1304 Binlang Road. The police ordered detectives to go to Xu's house to investigate, but Xu had already fled. His belongings were not taken away and should also be disposed of. However, there are many witnesses in the case, and the defendants' confessions are lengthy. The trial will take a long time. He requested that a special court hearing be scheduled. Judge Qian then ordered that a special court hearing be scheduled. The items belonging to Yu Ziying and Xu Shengquan were ordered to be sealed and stored in the warehouse. If it is inconvenient to store them, they can be auctioned off, and the proceeds will be preserved.</p>
<p>Hartung Couple</p>
<p>Legally Married</p>
<p>Judgment of the English Registrar</p>
<p>The estate case of the deceased wealthy businessman Hartung was heard several times by the English Registrar last week. The plaintiff argued that Hartung was an Iraqi and should be dealt with according to Iraqi law. They also claimed that Jewish law does not recognize the marriage between a Jew and a non-Jew. The defendant's lawyer strongly refuted the plaintiff's claim on the issue of Hartung's wife's identity and argued that the deceased Hartung was British and should be dealt with according to English law. After the English Registrar continued the hearing yesterday morning, the Registrar, Grace, ruled on the marriage issue, stating that the Hartung couple were legally married. The plaintiff had failed to provide evidence to prove that the marriage was illegal according to English law. The defendant's lawyer then continued to argue the issue of the deceased Hartung's British nationality, presenting six points, stating that according to the Privy Council's order, Hartung should be British: 1. He was British according to the Privy Council's order. 2. He died in China, so his will and property should naturally be under the jurisdiction of the English Registrar. 3. Such cases should be under the jurisdiction of the court of the deceased's residence and handled in accordance with the laws stipulated in the treaty. The issue of nationality is not actually very important. 4. The deceased was under British protection, and the British King taxed his property, so he was naturally British in fact. 5. The deceased served as a director of the Shanghai Municipal Council on behalf of the British community during his lifetime. 6. When the Chinese government awarded him medals, it recognized him as British.</p>

<p>Eight Thieves Captured Awaiting Investigation</p>
<p>Due to repeated theft cases in Caohejing District, the Caohejing Defense Corps investigated and found a gang of bandits hiding in thatched huts in Sanjiali, Xiaomu Bridge, Longhua. All were found to be migrants. Yesterday morning, around 4:00 AM, they, together with the second branch of the fifth team of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps, gathered a large force and rushed to surround and capture the bandits. The bandits, awakened from their dreams, immediately opened fire to resist arrest. The Defense Corps team immediately ordered a spread out encirclement, opening fire and breaking down the door. After about ten minutes, they shot and killed one thief and captured eight. A few bandits escaped with guns. The eight captured thieves were taken back to the corps headquarters. Two bullet casings were found in the house. It was learned that the deceased thief was named Xu Yongnian, 44 years old, from Suqian. The captured criminals were handed over to the Public Security Bureau. The head of the village, Zhang Liqing, was ordered to report to the court for verification.

<p>A Manufacturing Facility Uncovered on Yaozhu Road</p>
<p>Zhao Youming and Yongxiang, from Sichuan, recently jointly rented a Western-style house at No. 112 Yaozhu Road in the French Concession, setting up a private morphine manufacturing facility. They secretly manufactured and sold it, making a considerable profit. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by Lu Jinbao and Cao Fuchang, detectives from the Beidang Road French Concession Police Department. They reported to the police chief, who, along with Western detective Lü Aicai (transliteration), rushed to search the premises at 2:00 AM on the 12th. It was already late at night, and the people in the house were asleep. The detectives knocked on the door and entered. On the third floor, they seized manufacturing machinery, motors, and a large number of manufacturing equipment, such as porcelain sand filter tanks, funnels, large and small glass tanks and bottles, medicinal materials, and seventeen packages of dry and wet powder, weighing 394 and 3/4 catties (being finished and unfinished morphine raw materials), worth over 100,000 gold. Hou Yunshan, Jin Yushan, the cook Liu Mingzhang, and coolies Hou Lihe and Tu Hongfa, five people in charge of the house, were arrested on the spot. However, Zhao and Ou were not at the premises, but lived in another residence. Hou and the other five were taken to the police station along with the machinery, etc., and temporarily detained. At noon that day, Zhao and Ou were also arrested. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Second Special District Local Court for investigation. At 3:00 PM, Judge Wu Fanglian (originally Judge Xiong Huiping's court session, but Wu substituted due to Xiong's leave) and registrar Fei Zongkan came to the First Criminal Court for interrogation. First, Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the police station, stated the case, saying, "The police station discovered a manufacturing site for opium substitutes on the third floor of No. 121 Yaozhu Road at 2:00 AM on the 12th, arresting the third to seventh defendants at the time, and the first and second defendants were arrested later. Now, they are being prosecuted under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. However, the police station has not yet completed the procedures due to the time of investigation, so it requests that the incriminating evidence be stored in the warehouse first and that a hearing be granted for further investigation at a later date." After Judge Wu briefly questioned the defendants, he approved a postponement of the hearing to the 16th. The defendants were detained, and the seized items were stored in the warehouse.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Zhao Xilin Shot by Enemies <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Seriously Injured, Life in Danger</p>
<p>Zhao Xilin, 33 years old, from Changzhou, lives at No. 24 Shoude Lane, Yangshupu Road. He used to be a detective in his hometown of Wujin County, and his work was highly valued by his superiors. Recently, he has also been working in Shanghai as an inspector at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill and as a security guard at the China First Sock Factory. He also runs the Leyi Lou beach volleyball court at No. 40 Songpan Road. Because of this, Zhao sometimes comes to Shanghai to handle public and private affairs. In July of last year, Zhao arrested a large number of communists in Wujin County and punished them according to the law, which caused them to bear a grudge and plan to harm him. Soon after, Zhao became aware of this and secretly came to Shanghai to avoid their attacks. However, the bandits followed him and were forced to attack him once, hitting him with two shots. Fortunately, they were not fatal. After medical treatment at Tongren Hospital, he recovered. This happened last winter. After this shooting, Zhao was always accompanied by several people when traveling between Shanghai and Changzhou, and the protection along the way was very thorough. For several months, everything was peaceful. Yesterday evening, around 9:00 PM, Zhao came to Shanghai from Changzhou on the night express train. After arriving, he first hired a car to Leyi Lou for a short rest. At 10:15 PM, he planned to return home to sleep. However, after walking only a few steps, in the drizzling rain, he suddenly encountered two enemies who seemed familiar. They said, "Brother Xilin, wait a moment, let me shoot you once." Then, they fired two shots. One hit his abdomen, severing his large intestine, and the other missed. Zhao immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, took the opportunity to escape without a trace. Afterwards, he was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment by car. The doctor performed an abdominal examination and administered artificial resuscitation. He is currently still in critical condition.</p>

<p>It's Difficult to Be a Father</p>
<p>Shen Genmao, 22 years old, from Suzhou, lives at No. 53 Zhejiang Road and works as a barber. The day before yesterday, around 2:00 PM, after arguing with his father, he secretly went out and committed suicide by swallowing opium. When he returned home at 2:00 AM, his wife, Shen Zhang, noticed it and, together with his father, took Genmao to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported to the Laozha Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Li Ying from the First Special District Court came to the morgue to examine the body. Shen Zhang testified that the deceased was her husband, married for over a year. When her husband returned home, it was already late at 2:00 AM. He only said that he was dizzy and thirsty, so she gave him tea to quench his thirst. Later, she saw that he could not speak, so she told his father, and they took him to Renji Hospital together, but he died halfway there. Shen Jinlong, the father of the deceased, testified that he was 65 years old and only had this one son. He set up the barber shop. That day, he asked him to work, but he refused, so he gave him some advice, and he went out alone and suddenly took poison. After hearing the testimony, Mr. Li ruled that the deceased, male Shen Genmao, committed suicide by taking poison before death. The body was handed over to his father, Shen Jinlong, to take back for burial.</p>

<p>Escapes to Nanjing With a Dancer</p>
<p>Police Send Detectives to Arrest Him in Shanghai</p>
<p>The China Lard Oil Company was founded by a foreign merchant and has a branch in Hankou. Roberts Blanens, a Latvian, is the branch manager, and Shen Shucheng is the Chinese manager. At the end of last month, a man named Li Jian agreed to sell goods to the branch and signed a contract with both the Chinese and foreign managers. Li paid a deposit of 20,000 yuan as agreed, and the money was deposited in a bank in Hankou. Unexpectedly, the next day, Roberts privately used the branch's name to withdraw all the deposit and remit it to Shanghai. He personally brought the draft to Shanghai on the 3rd of this month and went to the accepting bank to exchange it for cash, which he deposited in another bank. The account name, in addition to himself, was his lover, Mrs. Biteli Tushipishi, a Romanian national. It is said that this woman is now a dancer. After Roberts disposed of the money, he went to the head office, but never mentioned the transaction. On the 5th, Shen Shucheng, the Chinese manager of the Hankou branch, telegraphed the head office because Roberts had absconded with the funds. At that time, Roberts had already left Shanghai with his lover. The head of the head office reported to the General Inspectorate, which sent detectives to investigate and found that the two were staying in Nanjing. They were immediately arrested and brought back to Shanghai. The deposit was temporarily detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that Roberts was charged with embezzlement and his concubine was charged with receiving stolen goods. After Judge Qian questioned them, he ordered Mrs. Bi to pay 3,000 yuan bail, while Roberts was detained and the hearing was postponed.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Maid Dismissed and Doesn't Return Home <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Freely Combines With Garment Store Employee</p>
<p>Openly Says It Was Consensual</p>
<p>Store Employee Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months</p>
<p>Jin Lin, a woman from Lu Xu, Suzhou, used to work as a maid at the Zhongxin Hotel on Hankou Road. Her daughter, Jin Sanbao, is only seventeen years old and quite beautiful. Last year, she was introduced to the Yang family at No. 56 Yian Lane, Wang Jingan Temple Road, as a maid. Opposite the back door of the Yang family, at No. 30, is the Dahua Garment Store. Zhao Changfu, an employee from Taixing, 24 years old, is a young and handsome bachelor. He became acquainted with Jin Girl when they saw each other coming and going. On the 8th of this month, the Yang family suddenly dismissed Jin Girl. Unexpectedly, Jin did not return to her mother's house, but went directly to find Zhao Changfu. They went to the New World Company rooftop garden to play. At 10:00 PM, tired of playing, this young couple, unable to control their emotions, went to room 45 of the Southeast Hotel on Baike Road and had intercourse for two nights. On the 10th, at 12:00 AM, they moved to room 24 of the Kade Hotel on Kade Road and continued to have intercourse for one night. However, after the Yang family dismissed Jin Girl, they sent someone to her mother's house the next day to ask if Jin Girl had returned. Her mother, Jin Lin, was still unaware and only then realized something was wrong. She went to Yian Lane to investigate. People said they saw Jin Girl go out to watch a play with Zhao Changfu, an employee of the garment store. The woman then reported to the Jingan Temple Police Station. Chinese detectives Cui Buyun and Qian Xianting arrested Zhao in the Dahua Garment Store. He confessed without denying it and said that Jin Girl was still in the Kade Hotel. The detectives went to arrest Jin Sanbao and brought them both back to the police station. The police chief ordered Zhao to be detained and Jin Girl to be temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang came forward to state the facts, saying that Jin Girl had been sent to Guangren Hospital by the police station for examination and it was confirmed that her hymen had been broken. Although the girl claimed to be seventeen years old, according to Chinese age reckoning, she may not be sixteen years old, so the age issue is relevant to the sentence and should be investigated. Jin Lin testified that she was 44 years old and her daughter Sanbao was 17 years old, born in the year of the Dragon, on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month. She used to work as a maid in the Yang family. On the sixth of this month, the Yang family sent someone to her place to ask if Jin Girl had returned. She had not returned, so she went to Yian Lane to investigate and only then did she learn the truth. She reported it to the police station and now requests that the defendant be punished. Jin Sanbao testified that she had known the defendant since February of this year due to clothing manufacturing, but they had never had a relationship. On the recent Dragon Boat Festival, the employer dismissed her because she thought her clothes were too short. She wanted to go home, but her mother was very fierce and she was afraid of being punished, so she went to the New World Company to play with the defendant and the store owner's wife. At 10:00 PM, they went out and went to the Southeast Hotel to open a room. However, this was consensual and there was no coercion. Judge Feng Shide asked Jin Girl who had the idea to open a room and who initiated it. The girl answered that the defendant first said, "Let's go open a room, okay?" She answered, "Okay." So they stayed at the Southeast Hotel for two nights and later moved to the Kade Hotel for one night. This matter was voluntary. The defendant confessed to the adultery, but said that after leaving the New World Company, he advised her to go home, but the girl said that her mother was violent and did not want to go back and voluntarily borrowed a machine room. Finally, police lawyer Wang stated that according to the plaintiff's testimony, her age was actually not yet sixteen years old, so the defendant actually committed rape and should be investigated. Judge Feng sentenced the defendant Zhao Changfu to three years and six months of imprisonment for raping a girl under the age of sixteen. The number of days of detention before the judgment is final will be counted as two days equivalent to one day of imprisonment. The girl was taken back by her mother.</p>
<p>Enticement is Certainly a Crime</p>
<p>But the Young Girl Has No Sense of Shame</p>
<p>Wang Xiaosan Covets Abao</p>
<p>Abao Actually Agrees Immediately</p>
<p>Li Abao, a woman from Yangzhou, is twenty years old, of average appearance, and lives at No. 48 Weixing Lane, Tuopeng Road. She is a female worker at the Shenxin No. 7 Cotton Mill. Wang Xiaosan, a fellow villager, coveted Abao. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, around 2:00 PM, he asked a friend named Ying Xizi to go to the house of Yangzhou woman Li Jiang (Abao's cousin), next door at No. 46, and conspired with Kong Qingsheng and Wang Changjin (also from Yangzhou) to lure Abao out. They hired a car at the Pingliang Road vegetable market, and Ying and Kong accompanied the girl to the Bund on Wuma Road, where Wang Xiaosan was waiting. Seeing that Li Abao had been tricked by the group, he was delighted to have his lover and praised the pimps for their skillful methods. However, Abao was afraid that Wang was a bad person and showed signs of timidity. Ying Xizi patted his chest to reassure her. The woman knew Ying. Wang Xiaosan and Abao took a car to a hotel in the French Concession for a night of adultery. The next day, they went to the Tangshan Hotel on Tangshan Road in the Public Concession to continue their joy. Since Abao's disappearance, her mother, Li Zhang, had been searching everywhere for her, but there was no news. The day before yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, a report was made to the Yulin Road Police Station, and detective Li Minglin found Li Abao on Dagu Road after an investigation. After learning the truth, he secretly went to arrest Li Jiang, Kong Qingsheng, Wang Changjin, and others. Wang Xiaosan, who lived at No. 2185 Dongyouheng Road, had heard the news and fled. Ying Xizi could not be arrested either. The police chief ordered the three defendants to be detained separately. Li Abao was taken back by her mother, Zhang. Yesterday morning, the police sent Li Jiang, Kong Qingsheng, and Wang Changjin to the First Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the facts in detail. The girl, Li Abao, wearing a blue Western-style cloth shirt, black silk trousers, stockings, and satin shoes, with short hair, lowered her head and spoke calmly. She said that her fiancé, a coppersmith, lived on Xiangyan Bridge and was allowed to marry by her mother. She briefly described the circumstances and said that the matter was entirely due to being fooled by Ying Xizi, who was on the run. At the time, her cousin, the defendant Li Jiang, called her out, saying she wanted to say a word, and she fell into their trap. Kong Qingsheng and Wang Changjin had both been to the hotel. When questioned, the three defendants Li Jiang and others gave evasive answers and asked for leniency. Judge Shen Bingrong ordered them to be remanded in custody separately for further review.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Wu Yuezhen Sues Husband for Abandonment <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Demands Zhang Dehua Pay 8,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Wu Yuezhen, a young woman from Wuxian, Suzhou, lives with her mother in the Chengyu Lane on Lafayette Road in the French Concession. In June of last year, she married Zhang Dehua as a concubine. Recently, she was abandoned. She hired lawyer Chen Guocai to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court, stating that she was suing for the abandonment of a concubine. The plaintiff, a weak woman, relied on her mother for a living. In February of last year, Zhang Dehua suddenly met her and, with sweet words, she fell in love at first sight. The love affair began, and she became pregnant. In June, she officially married him as a concubine. They rented a house and bought furniture, and lived together. She thought the marriage was perfect and she could rely on him for the rest of her life. Unexpectedly, the defendant, a lecherous man, was tired of the old and loved the new. The former oath was still fresh, but his attitude had changed. He went out in search of pleasure and forgot to return. At first, she tried to be tolerant and did her best to endure it. But in January of this year, she gave birth to a daughter. But the defendant was heartless and had no pity. Not only did he ignore her, but he also suddenly cut off the plaintiff's regular expenses and asked someone to say that he wanted to divorce the concubine. The man was wicked to the extreme, leaving her miserable and heartbroken. Adding to her worries was the crying baby. Even if she wanted to remarry, how easy would it be? Unfortunately, her old mother died after she married. Helpless, without any means of support, she had to resign herself to her fate and endure her remaining years. She had previously applied for mediation, but it was unsuccessful. If this dragged on, both mother and daughter would be in danger of freezing and starving. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit according to the law to seek relief. The plaintiff's maintenance fee is calculated at 20 yuan per month for twenty years, totaling 4,800 yuan. The daughter's upbringing fee is calculated at 200 yuan per year for sixteen years, totaling 3,200 yuan. The two total 8,000 yuan, which should be paid by the defendant at once, so that she can deposit the money and live off the interest. She respectfully submits this complaint and requests that the court quickly summon the defendant to court for interrogation and judgment. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the hearing was held. The judge asked the plaintiff Wu Yuezhen her age and origin. Because the defendant Zhang Dehua did not appear, the judge announced that the hearing would be postponed to the next time.</p>

<p>Zhongxi Pharmacy on Fourth Avenue has a new Red Magic Pill, which specializes in treating all kinds of seasonal epidemics, acute sha, cholera vomiting and diarrhea, dizziness, stuffiness, qi blockage, and fainting. Its effectiveness is extremely fast. Its contents are the same as those packaged on the market. The pharmacy is now striving for universality and sells each catty for only 1 yuan and 6 jiao, which is about 17,000 pills. Each hundred costs only one cent of silver. If philanthropists purchase and distribute them, they can buy four times the goods for the same price. Invisibly, they can save more lives, which is a great merit.</p>

<p>Shanghai citizens, in view of the January 28 Incident, generally believe that the French Concession is relatively safe. Although the situation is now roughly stable, most of the refugees have returned to their hometowns, but the houses in the concession are still fully occupied. For example, the newly built houses in Shunan Lane on West Aixin Road were completed at the end of last month and have already been rented by those who could afford it. There are still two houses left, which will soon be rented out as well.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern: Recently, reports have stated that our company is only in contact with the Chinese government to supply ships, fly the Chinese flag, and operate coastal inland routes. This is not true. Please publish this in the newspaper to show the facts. Thank you very much. Respectfully, Baudewill, Assistant Manager of Dalei Company.</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Shenbao Newspaper: Having recently read in the June 13th issue of your newspaper, on the third page, based on Japanese newspaper reports, about the reason for Song's resignation, it says that the opium public sale plan failed, but his confidants are trying to carry it out. This kind of baseless talk in Japanese newspaper reports is not worth refuting. However, since Shouyong has not taken up the position of Deputy Minister of Finance, he has no reason to participate in this matter. For several months, he has been deeply concerned about the social economy, but unable to remedy it. He has retreated to his home to edit the posthumous writings of the enlightened ancestors of his hometown. Except for following the public in participating in matters related to the aftermath of the Songhu Incident, he absolutely does not discuss politics. Moreover, opium public sales are something that he has deeply opposed throughout his life. Therefore, I hereby declare this and ask that it be corrected immediately. With best wishes, Zhang Shouyong, June 13th.</p>

<p>Spot Exchange Near Gold Market</p>
<p>Entering a Stagnant State</p>
<p>Market Volume Only Four Taels: Yesterday's gold price weakened slightly, and the market was sluggish. The trading volume throughout the day did not exceed three taels, with an overall drop of only four mace. There were few transactions in the market. In short, with the spot exchange approaching, both buyers and sellers were hesitant to act. People were also indecisive. The price dropped slightly in the early morning, influenced by the rise in the silver market. Afterward, it fluctuated around 725 taels, with slight movements of one or two taels at times. However, a certain bank purchased more than 300 bars of spot gold at a price of 24 taels, sold by Wing Fung, Heng Tung, Fung Wing, Tai Tak Shing, etc., to cover</p>
<p>forward contracts. The market was particularly quiet afterward, with prices standing outside 24 taels. The day's overall situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Opening Lower: The seven-month opening price dropped slightly by eight mace to 724 taels. Overnight, the big bars rebounded by one-sixteenth to one-eighth, and the silver price also rose by one-eighth. Subsequently, due to Zhee Fung, Wing Hip Hing, Wing Yue Wo, Fook Yu, Heng Yu, Tai Tak Shing, Heng Hing, Bing Hing, and others entering the market to buy, the price jumped more than two taels to 26 taels and three mace. As for August U.S. dollars, the closing price was $31, and July was $30.8115. British gold was offered at 181875 by San Ping and others for September. U.S. dollars were also offered at $25. Later, Tai Tak Shing, Heng Hing, Zhee Fung, Wing Yue Wo, and others sold off again, causing a drop of two taels and several mace, reaching 23 and a half taels by 9:30 AM. There were fluctuations of seven or eight mace in between. HSBC's listed exchange rates remained unchanged, fluctuating between 24 taels and three mace and 23 taels and seven mace. Subsequently, there was a slight increase, but the fluctuations were uncertain, and transactions among the various firms were also complex, but limited in number. After 10 AM, it was reported that a certain bank bought 315 bars of spot gold, with Tung Fung, Heng Tai, Tak Shing, Wing Fung, and Heng et al. also buying. Yuan Mao Wing, Hung Kong Wing, Tung Tai Cheung, Qian Cheung Cheung, Heng Yu, and others followed suit. The exchange market was stable. Sumitomo absorbed October gold at $25, so the gold price rebounded by more than one tael. At 10:50 AM, it was 25 taels and two mace. Afterward, Heng Hing, Bing Hing, and others sold off, resulting in a drop of over one tael. At 11:00 AM, it was 23 and a half taels, with only three or four mace of fluctuation. Heng Hing sold again, limited to zero customers. At 11:20 AM, it was 24 taels and four mace, then back to 24 taels. The noon closing price was 24 taels and two mace, with the listed price still calculated at 793 taels, approximately 70 taels in total.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market a Deserted Scene: The afternoon market opened at 24 taels and four mace, then moved from four taels and seven mace to four taels and three mace. Bing Hing bought, while Heng Hing sold. Afterward, it was extremely quiet, with only a one or two mace increase between 2:30 and 3:00 PM, with retail customers and goods coming in. Bing Hing held the price, so it did not decline. The exchange market was also flat. The silver company bought U.S. dollars for August at $8125. Wheat firms absorbed U.S. dollars for October at half a yuan. Until 3:10 PM, it was 24 taels and eight mace. After this, it was still fluctuating by only a few mace. The firms held back. After 3:30 PM, Heng Hing, Tai Tak Shing, and others sold off, resulting in a decrease of five or six mace. At 4:00 PM, it was 24 taels and one mace, eventually slightly advancing with a purchase of headgear at 24 taels and a half. At 4:30 PM, the market closed at 24 taels and four mace, a decrease of four mace compared to last Saturday. The day's maximum was 26 taels and three mace, and the minimum was 23 taels and five mace, a difference of two taels and eight mace. The listed price totaled approximately 68 or 9 taels, and the account balance was calculated at 24 taels, with red bars adding 8 taels.</p>
<p>Many Speculators Observing: Transaction statistics on the table showed that Yuan Mao Wing, Fook Tai Heng, Yuan Tai, Hip Hing Wing, Tung Tai Cheung, Heng Yu, Qian Cheung Cheung all bought. Tai Tak Shing, Zhee Fung Wing, Bing Hing, Yue Wo, Hung Kong Wing saw varied buying and selling. Heng Hing and Fook Yu both sold. In the afternoon, Bing Hing and goods both bought. Tai Tak Shing and Heng Hing both sold. The remaining firms belonged to other categories. The Dalian group only had about 200 or 300 bars of transactions, while the Cantonese group sold more than 1,000 bars and bought 400 or 500 bars. As of last Saturday, the total number of exchange contracts was about 22,500 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Exchange Market Mediocre Situation <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The silver market was uneventful at the beginning of the week. Overnight, however, exchange rates rose slightly. The Shanghai market was quite mediocre. HSBC's listed prices only increased by one yuan for the French franc and half a mark for the German mark. The rest remained unchanged. As for the domestic British and American exchange rates, they were also very stable, fluctuating very little throughout the day. The results were similar to last Saturday. With the gold market trading volume not exceeding three taels, the industry held a prudent attitude due to the exchange rate fluctuations. The various banks were transacting, but in small amounts. Approximately 100,000 pounds sterling were traded. Gold group scalpers varied. Citibank and Bombay both bought. Approximately 400,000 to 500,000 U.S. dollars were traded. The silver company bought for July, while the various firms closed for July and August and covered short positions, selling off September and October to cover gold, with the spread around 31 or 32 taels. There were no large-scale transactions, and the market seemed stable.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Slight Progress in Silver and Currency Business <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Observing yesterday's market situation, there was still no strong atmosphere. However, banks were more active in adjusting silver dollars and silver ingots compared to the past few days. Qianzhuang also had considerable development in opening current accounts. Therefore, although the interbank lending rate was not outstanding, business seemed better than in the past. As for foreign exchange rates, although they rose slightly, it is not certain whether they will improve from now on. According to the reporter's observations, it is still feared that a downturn is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rates: The "foreign exchange" interbank lending rate was actively bid in the early market, eventually rising to 6 mace 9 fen 2 li 7 hao 5 si, better by 1 li 7 hao 5 si compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market fell back by 2 hao 5 si to 6 mace 9 fen 2 li 5 si, making it difficult to maintain a firm position. "Silver exchange" remained relaxed yesterday after tightening the previous day, calculated at 8 fen, the same for both morning and afternoon, smaller by 4 fen compared to the previous day. The premium for bank overdrafts was initially very high, still at a market price of 1 mace 8 or 9 fen. Finally, overdrafts became abundant, gradually falling to a closing price of 7 or 8 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: There were few transactions in Jiangnan small silver coins, so competition was not strong. As a result, there was no fluctuation, remaining the same as the previous day at 5 mace 9 fen 5 li. There were also no increases or decreases in the morning and afternoon markets. The transaction volume was 3,500 jiao in the morning market and 1,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were 5 mace 8 fen 9 li 2 hao 5 si in the morning market and 5 mace 8 fen 9 li 7 hao 5 si in the afternoon market, an increase of 1 li 2 hao 5 si compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The transaction volume was 165,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased slightly by 500 wen to 424,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" Yesterday was Monday, and bank openings and closings were relatively prosperous. Chinese merchants received and cleared over 2.9 million in ticket funds, 1.3 to 1.4 million in exchange and mortgage funds, over 1.2 million in goods funds, 600,000 to 700,000 in customs duties, and 2.7 million in foreign and miscellaneous funds. 500,000 was deposited in warehouses. Foreign merchants received and cleared over 3.1 million in ticket funds, 3.4 to 3.5 million in various goods, exchange, and mortgage funds, over 800,000 in telegraphic transfer funds, a special receipt of 500,000, 700,000 to 800,000 in mortgage transactions, and 800,000 deposited in warehouses. Qianzhuang and silver companies received and cleared over 26 million in single receipts, over 4.8 million in overdraft funds, over 800,000 in various remittance funds, and over 1 million in cash withdrawals. "Foreign Funds" The exchange and ticket funds made in the morning market were 970,000, and the afternoon market was 448,000. Banknotes were 75,000 for both sessions. Extramural transactions were 230,000 for both sessions. Check transactions were 55,000 for both sessions. Banks traded 900,000 in interbank transactions in the morning market and 400,000 in interbank transactions in the afternoon market. Transactions between foreign exchange accounts in various banks were 1.1 to 1.3 million, and banknote inflows and outflows were over 1.9 million. Qianzhuang and foreign exchange companies received and cleared over 6.4 million in single receipts, over 2.3 to 2.4 million in foreign exchange overdraft funds, and 1.3 to 1.4 million in foreign exchange lending inflows and outflows. The transaction volume of small qianzhuang was 600,000 to 700,000. As for transactions from and to other ports, which had been quiet for a long time, there were still no reports.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Securities <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Bonds Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Trading Volume of 3.1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (13th), the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange's various bond markets saw a total of 43,000 yuan of spot trades, including 18,000 yuan of salt tax bonds, 10,000 yuan of reorganization bonds, and only several thousand yuan for the others. Although futures trading was slightly more than last weekend, market sentiment remained sluggish, and buying and selling transactions were quiet. The morning session saw approximately 1.8 million yuan in transactions, and the afternoon session saw only 1.2 million yuan, totaling 3.065 million yuan. Apart from 760,000 yuan for salt tax bonds and 630,000 yuan for consolidated tax bonds, the remaining bonds only saw trading volumes between 200,000 and 300,000 yuan. General Six Customs bonds were particularly scarce, with no market for 96 bonds. The trend of the various bonds was that the situation in all industries showed no improvement, appearing dull. Investors were hesitant to observe, and new buying transactions were very rare. Although sellers did not engage in large-scale</p>
<p>sales, there were quite a few retail sell-offs, so the market supply exceeded demand, and all prices continued to fall compared to before. Although July futures were close to settlement, there was little interest in the market, and prices were very weak. Given the current environmental situation, it is difficult to expect development in the bond market in the near future.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the New York stock market saw the largest fluctuations in Auburn Automobile stock. Other stocks also followed suit. At the opening, Auburn stock rose to $76 and continued to advance. However, due to numerous sell-offs, it reverted to Friday's market price of $66.75. Other stocks also started strong but weakened later, but the fluctuations were not as large as Auburn stock. During weekends, winning customers often take the opportunity to clear their positions. The closing prices for bonds, industrials, and utilities all fell by several points compared to Friday. However, railway stocks rose by 0.24. Apart from slight increases in retail sales and the automobile industry, there were no significant business news. There were also no important announcements from Washington. The Dow Jones Index for Saturday is attached below:</p>

<p>Yarn Market Selling Pressure Continues</p>
<p>New Low Prices Constantly Discovered</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market declined and then stabilized in the afternoon. However, real demand remained weak, and all parties had no hope for development. The overseas situation was still deteriorating, and the economic situation in all directions was extremely barren. People's livelihoods were increasingly difficult, so it was difficult for cotton yarn sales to improve. Most Zhuang customers from North China stationed in Shanghai closed down and returned home due to the lack of business, which shows the scarcity of business. Japanese factories were making efforts in all directions, and the sales of Chinese yarn were stolen by them. However, most people in the local area believe that the recent storm of price declines may have a slight rebound. However, the world cotton industry is still in a tragic situation.</p>
<p>Auction Prices Drop Another One or Two Taels: According to the opening of the market, the selling pressure in the market was strong, and the decline continued. Prices for each month fell by 1.2, 3, 4, and 7 qian. The afternoon opening situation was still weak, and new low prices were found in the second session. Later, profit-takers covered their short positions, and prices rebounded in each month, resulting in a flat outcome. The total transaction volume for the day was 33,700 bales. Chang Feng sold 2,250 bales, Geng Feng sold 1,050 bales, Rong Xing sold 1,350 bales, Yi Yu sold 1,000 bales, and Ji Feng sold 700 bales. Tong Fu bought 1,150 bales, Tong Yu bought 800 bales, Shun Da bought 800 bales, Yi Chang bought 1,100 bales, and Da Chang bought 700 bales. The closing prices are listed below: Auction, Closing, Change, Account Balance. October 1462, 17, 44.750</p>

<p>The clearing of spot yarn remains stagnant. According to statistics, all groups bought only 455 bales throughout the day. Colleagues bought 55 bales. Prices fell by 1 or 2 taels. Guangdong customers bought 210 bales, inland customers bought 80 bales, Luzhou bales, Sichuan bought 40 bales, and Yunnan bought 80 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Cotton Market Decline <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Becoming More Powerful</p>
<p>Decrease Reaching More Than Half a Tael</p>
<p>The decline in the cotton market is intensifying, mainly because the base price of cotton is too high. Last year, factories used cheap foreign cotton and filled their warehouses with ample reserves. Recently, U.S. cotton has also trended downward, breaking through the 5-cent mark in July, and the situation remains weak. The current period is gradually entering the plum rain season, and no one is interested in stockpiled goods from all over. Credit is tighter than in previous years, so people are more panicked. There are reports of sharp declines in cotton prices in Jinan, Shandong, Zhengzhou, Henan, Tianjin, Hebei, and other producing areas. It is more difficult for the cotton market to support itself. However, Shanghai cotton merchants are still buying more standard cotton due to the low prices. However, compared with the world cotton market, the upward force is thin.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Sellers Still Pour In: The Zheng Biao market opened with weak U.S. cotton, and sellers in the market were active. Prices for each month fell by 5 or 6 qian. In the afternoon, bullish buyers added to their positions, rising by 5 qian to 1 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 92,400 dan. Chang He sold 6,700 dan, Yi Feng sold 3,900 dan, Xin Cheng sold 2,400 dan, Heng Yi sold 2,800 dan, and Chang Feng sold 3,100 dan. Yuan Da bought 4,500 dan, Yuan Da bought 5,900 dan, Chang Feng bought 2,300 dan, and Sui Long bought 3,000 dan.</p>
<p>The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Mills Closing Down: Spot cotton mills are cutting off supplies due to the harsh environment. The target cotton is falling, and there is no intention to buy. The source is 1,100 bales of Yuyao cotton.</p>

<p>Bombay: U.S. cotton fell last week. The region was able to maintain its levels due in part to Far East exporters selling off inventory to take profits. Part of the offset comes from new Broach cotton starting to be transacted. Currently, merchants are moving their hedged positions into the new crop due to Broach cotton prices trading at a premium. In the spot market, local mills purchased limited quantities to blend with U.S. cotton. The numbers for the week are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1951, 1932</p>
<p>Accumulated receipts from September 1, 3,112, 1,856</p>
<p>Inventories at weekend, 938, 854</p>
<p>Accumulated exports from September 1, 2,067, 801</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe, 528, 116</p>
<p>Shipped to China, 343, 192</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan, 1,175, 459</p>

<p>Liverpool: spot demand improved the last week, mostly on U.S. cotton. Futures demand was slow given the economy and soft news out of the U.S. on crop progress and the Garner relief bill passing Congress. A slight recovery was seen to end the week, but activity was still slow. Egyptian cotton behaved similarly to U.S. cotton.</p>

<p>Needle, Eyebrow, and Pearl Tea Sales Thrive in Europe</p>
<p>Yesterday, high-grade green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi remained stagnant. However, needle, eyebrow, and pearl tea from local estates in Wenzhou and Yushan saw strong interest from British Zhuang, Jardine Matheson, Harmony, Jin Long, Dute, and other firms due to demand from abroad. However, tea markets uniformly trended downward, mostly due to the influx of supply, which made people anxious. Most Chinese merchants were eager to sell. From the current market situation, it is difficult for the market to stabilize.</p>

<p>Wuyuan tea firms stopped handling tea. Wuyuan firms received bad news from Shanghai, and the market did not improve. To preserve capital, most decided to stop processing and close the market. For local garden goods, they did not handle any leaves. In the past two days, mountain merchants from Tuochuan, Yuan, and other villages in the northern region were willing to sell their new tea at 50 yuan, but few people discussed opening the scales. Most tea merchants are waiting for better prices, but at current market prices, they would lose 20 to 30 yuan per dan and have nowhere to sell. Currently, popular Pu Zhen varieties are mostly diverted to Hangzhou and Shanghai due to unsuppressed river bandits.</p>
<p>Tunxi Tea Sales Stagnant: Various sources of Tunxi tea poured in, repeatedly discussing prices with firms. Although prices shrank to 48 yuan, Tunzhen still did not get high prices due to the poor Shanghai market. They dare not increase purchases and take risks. Various firms have mountains of domestic goods, totaling no less than 5,000 dan. Merchants are worried and hope that the Shanghai market will recover soon.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Grain and Rice Market Rebounds by Two Jiao <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday's rice market saw over 20 ships from inland areas. The inventory in Pucun was not weak. Retail sales in urban and rural stores were weak. Thick japonica rice was newly priced. Second-grade rice fell by two jiao. Thin indica rice opened 300 stones for scattered bushels. Customers were not moving. Prices were short by two or three jiao. Early rice and deteriorating yuan were neither good nor bad, showing a slight downward trend. Foreign Dujian was being sold in a balanced way. The market was silent.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, about 16 or 17 rice boats from Changshu, Xianzhuang, and other areas arrived. Due to light rain, there were few people in the market in the morning. Transactions in Changshu northern japonica rice and Kunshan and Jiangyin rice were scarce. Prices opened down two chi. Thin indica and early rice also shorted by jiao. Deteriorating yuan was a sluggish in selling as it came. Luxiyangjian lacked supply and had no market. The Heshajiaobu market saw about 2,300 to 2,400 stones in total in the front and back markets.</p>

<p>Domestic Retail for All Rice Improves by Nearly Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market turned lively due to the presence of Nanjing groups, domestic Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and local village groups that were purchasing heavily. Market prices rose by about five or six fen to one jiao. Annan japonica rice is very similar to Hexia Dujaponica and is welcomed by the local and domestic markets. A new batch of about 5 bags arrived. The quality was slightly worse, and only 100 bags were opened. The price was 12 yuan and 6 jiao. A total of 5,600 bags of small grain rice were opened, with prices ranging from 10 yuan and 4 jiao to 1 jiao and a half. 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 were opened, with prices ranging from 11 yuan 7 jiao and a half to 6 jiao. 150 bags of Jiangxi Ji Yuan were also bought by the local group, with a price of 13 yuan and 7 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Flour Futures Fall Uniformly <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was stable in the morning after opening. However, due to the poor weather and a report of a fall in the price of foreign wheat by one jiao, the factories held back and did not sell, so transactions were quiet, and there was little change in the market. When the afternoon market opened, the market was weak, and there was no guarantee of stability. At 5:00 PM, selling pressure increased, and near and far months fell uniformly. The current sluggish retail sales are a fact. Therefore, the market cannot be saved for a while. It is also rumored that foreign flour in August will be shipped directly to Tianjin at a price of only 1 tael and 9 qian, and Tianjin groups have already transacted over 200,000. If this is true, Shanghai flour will have no standing. As a result, July and August fell by one fen each compared to the previous week, September fell by two fen, October fell by two and a half fen, and November fell by two fen.</p>

<p>Asking Price at 2.7 Taels</p>
<p>Future Wheat Market in Severe Slump</p>
<p>Yesterday, the future wheat market saw slight improvement in foreign wheat prices by 0.1 tael in the morning, and with slight rain, the prices for each month, while showing signs of weakness, did not plummet significantly. However, in the afternoon session, as the weather improved and inland merchants suddenly began aggressively selling, confidence waned, leading to a step-by-step crash. Inquiries about new wheat from Wuxi revealed prices around 3.1 taels for top-quality milling wheat in Shanghai, and only 3.1 taels and 2-3 fen in Nanjing. Elsewhere, prices lingered around the 3.1 tael mark. Given this situation, Shanghai mills, facing sluggish flour sales, remained on the sidelines, causing goods to accumulate in the market with a lack of buyers. The current slump is feared to be unprecedented. As a result, July contracts fell by 9 fen compared to the previous weekend's closing price, August contracts fell by 8 fen, September contracts fell by 9 fen, October contracts fell by 6 fen, and November contracts fell by 2 fen. Regarding the arrival of new wheat in Shanghai, it is reported that a ship from Penglai Town has arrived, with ordinary quality and an asking price of 2.7 taels, which even millers are hesitant to take, it is said.</p>

<p>Low Inventory... New Crop Still Far Off</p>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds, previously suffering from sluggish sales, had fallen below 50 taels for top and middle grades. However, due to limited inventory, the distant arrival of the new crop, and renewed demand from Guangdong, prices have gradually rebounded. Yesterday, the market price for Hengzhou lotus seeds was 57-58 taels, and secondary grades were 53-54 taels, with a stabilizing trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday's clearing on the public exchange saw quiet trading. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white remained priced at 13 taels and 9.5 qian, Hong Kong goods at 13 taels and 8 qian, with very quiet buyer interest and slow trading, showing a stable trend. The central white sugar market was more active, but transactions were also quiet. The Zhongbu market was robust, with No. 9 sugar clearing at 9 taels and 9 qian, with brisk transactions. Taikoo Sugar's B mark was at 16 taels and 2.5 qian, CW mark at 15 taels and 9 qian, and H mark at 12 taels and 4.5 qian. The Bu Xiang brand DY mark is out of stock, with strong demand. It is said that a shipment will arrive soon, with the trade's pre-sale price at 15 taels and 5 qian, which is quite favorable compared to the company's fixed price, so the market sentiment is quite firm. When the spot goods arrive in Shanghai, prices are bound to rise.</p>

<p>Huate woollens have been selling very well recently, with merchants from North China, Sichuan, and other ports sending letters to replenish their stocks. Yuan Chang's blue, yellow, gray, snuff-colored plain Huate woollens, as well as plaid Huate woollens and twill-dot covert cloth, are selling particularly well. The guild continues to release goods, and foreign firms are steadily releasing a significant amount of spot goods. Ning Feng and Tianfu plaid Huate woollens wholesale at 2 taels and 8 qian per case, Yong Feng at 2 taels and 9 qian, Kong Shi Rong Tai and Midi at 3 taels and 5 fen. Ning Feng's Ruyi Tu twill-dot covert cloth Huate woollens are at 2 taels, 8 qian, and 7.5 fen, Da Fugui miscellaneous plain Huate woollens at 3 taels and 1 qian and 7.5 fen, and Li He at 3 taels and 4 qian and 5 fen. Only iridescent Huate woollens are selling sluggishly, with no interest from local merchants. Yesterday, Huaji and Ning Feng brands were reduced to 3 taels and 3 qian across the board.</p>

<h3 id="e194">The Mentality of Island People <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The mentality of island people is becoming increasingly apparent to the world! Treating others' land as their lifeline is already ridiculous! What's especially ridiculous is that, while repeatedly claiming that others are unorganized countries, they consider countries that have a general assassinated with a bomb or a prime minister killed with a gun to be organized countries.</p>
<p>Narrow-mindedness, jealousy, and boasting are the three primary elements of the island people's mentality! Not only is this the mentality of the military, but it is also the mentality of their literati.</p>
<p>The complete works of the great poet Gao Qingqiu of the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties exist in a fine paper edition at the Aoki Sozan Hall in that country. The book is printed well! Unfortunately, it includes commentaries by Kondo Gensui of that country, adding dung to the Buddha's head, which I find deeply unfair to Qingqiu.</p>
<p>"Buying a thousand gold for a precious sword, the demon weeps for Taiyin, opening the box before the lamp, an infinite offering of your heart." This is Qingqiu's poem about swords. Because the precious sword of the Taishi country (i.e., Persia) is renowned throughout history, Qingqiu wrote, "Buying a thousand gold for a Taishi sword." Kondo Gensui, consumed by jealousy, added this marginal note: "Compared to a Japanese sword, it must have a difference between lead and iron."</p>
<p>"The deserted palace is filled with long moss at the end of spring, the skirt no longer sweeps the ground. I fear Xishi is a fairy, and there must be a pavilion in the cave." This is Qingqiu's poem about Xishi Cave, in which he compares Xishi Cave to a different world, not of this earth, which is the poet's ideal. Who knew that Mr. Kondo, consumed by jealousy, would add this marginal note: "The remains of a lewd woman, how could there be a different world?"</p>
<p>Five hundred years ago, the poet praised a Taishi sword! He had to say that the Taishi sword was lead, and the Japanese sword was iron. Only he could utter such an arbitrary statement. As for whether Xishi was a lewd woman, I fear everyone would deny it! Where exactly is the birthplace of lewd women? I would like to ask people from China and abroad for a fair critique! It is unlikely to be the Wu and Yue kingdoms two or three thousand years ago.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Problem of Bribery <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>The newspaper reports on the draft articles of the law on punishing corruption. Any civil servant who receives bribes or illegal benefits of more than one thousand yuan will be sentenced to death. Requesting promises or receiving bribes of more than five hundred yuan but less than one thousand yuan will be sentenced to life imprisonment. Furthermore, if a civil servant commits a crime under this article, the proposed bribe or benefit will be confiscated. If all or part cannot be confiscated, its value will be recovered, etc. This is a special law, different from the ordinary law, i.e., the criminal law, and is a special provision for calculating the amount of stolen goods and sentencing accordingly. The intention is to severely punish corruption and the law emphasizes calculating the amount of stolen goods. However, prison situations are ever-changing, and abstract legislation is difficult to be comprehensive. Suppose that someone, Mr. A, offers his wife, daughter, or sister to a civil servant as a gift. The civil servant accepts and, as requested, illegally appoints him to a position or unfairly judges a lawsuit in his favor. If the matter is discovered and reported to the authorities, and the investigation proves it to be true, he will be brought before a special court. Whether a woman is a bribe and whether her beauty and talent are benefits is worthy of research. In this case, the cause of the civil servant's crime is clearly this woman. If she is not considered a bribe, then the anti-corruption law does not apply, and even the criminal law would not consider it a crime of bribery. He may be punished for dereliction of duty or face administrative disciplinary action, which is clearly a case of a severe crime receiving a light punishment. Compared to those sentenced to death for one thousand yuan and those permanently banned for five hundred yuan, the national laws are inevitably biased. If she is considered a bribe, then the essence of this law lies in calculating the amount of stolen goods. This woman is neither a slave under Tang law, akin to cattle and horses, nor a common prostitute with a fixed price. Therefore, the method of calculating the amount of stolen goods is exhausted, and there is no way to confiscate or recover the value. The essence of this law in calculating the amount of stolen goods lies in the thousand yuan. Whether one is above or below the thousand yuan mark is a matter of life and death. I have pondered it a hundred times.</p>

<p>Mrs. Helen Wills Moody, a famous American tennis queen, is also a perennial champion in the international tennis world. She has repeatedly retained her titles.

<p>Gare St. Lazare, a famous French railway station, is the most well-equipped railway station. Passengers can buy clothes, books, and all kinds of food and drinks. There are also dentists who can treat teeth, and barbers who can give haircuts or shaves. There are also long-distance telephones that people can use to contact relatives and friends in distant places about important matters. There is also a cinema where people can watch movies to pass the time while their cars are being repaired. When the train is about to arrive, the screen will automatically announce it so that passengers can prepare to board.</p>
<p>In 1931, not a single criminal was executed in Scotland. There were also absolutely no executions in prisons.</p>
<p>Last year, a particularly unusual item was left unclaimed at the London railway station lost and found office: a baby. The station staff found it in the waiting room. (Hai Ke)</p>
<p>If one gains something, one should suffer a loss. I sincerely wish to learn from legal experts. Please do not regard this as a fictitious question. In the pursuit of wealth and power, base behaviors are inevitable. Since the late Qing Dynasty, as far as I have seen and heard, there have indeed been such things. Moreover, when I was working in the Ministry of Justice during the Guangxu and Xuantong eras, there was such a fact in a case of accepting bribery assigned by the emperor. The case involved several crimes, and the original charge included a certain crime. According to the Qing law, the heavier punishment was applied, and the lighter crime was not considered. Therefore, the confession prepared in the initial draft of the indictment, which is now the section describing the facts in the judgment, could be briefly mentioned. However, this is not in accordance with the laws of the Republic of China, nor is it in accordance with the special law on punishing corruption. Therefore, I presumptuously advocate that there is a need to supplement the draft law with three points: A. The term "bribe" in this law is not limited to property. B. Bribes that cannot be valued should be punished according to criminal law, and those with serious circumstances should be punished more severely, even up to the death penalty. C. For stolen goods that cannot be compensated, appropriate punishment may be imposed. With such supplements, the previous questions can be resolved. However, there are still doubts. It may be possible to apply this to an unknowing woman, but if the woman knows the situation, she is an accomplice. Moreover, there are many cases where women scheme for men, and the idea originates from the woman, making her the instigator of the crime. What is even more difficult is when the man is unaware. Suppose that A and B commit a criminal offense or are subject to disciplinary action. While in custody, A's wife or daughter, using B's name, offers herself to the civil servant as a gift. The civil servant accepts and illegally declares B innocent or dismisses the charges. In such a case, there is a bribe and a recipient of the bribe, but no briber, and the law is at an end. Generally speaking, laws are like bags, and facts are like awls. When an awl is placed in a bag, its point will immediately be seen, or it will emerge completely. It is almost impossible to encompass everything. What should those responsible for legislation do? Mr. Zaidong has long served as a legal official and has held positions in societies. He has both legal knowledge and experience. This issue is related to legislation and is not just an interesting article. It has practical value. If there are experts in the country who can provide answers, it is what my friend hopes for and what this publication welcomes. However, the space is limited, and the text should not be too long.

<h3 id="e197">Old Customs of the Dragon Boat Festival in Suzhou <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>According to Suzhou customs, every family hangs calamus swords on their doors during the Dragon Boat Festival. They all drink realgar wine for lunch, and children write the character "king" on their foreheads with realgar. The room is filled with burning Atractylodes lancea and Angelica dahurica to ward off epidemics. Although the government promotes the national calendar and abolishes the Dragon Boat Festival, the people still adhere to their habits and continue to celebrate it. This year, because the Japanese invaded and the 19th Route Army retreated to the second line of defense, families above the middle class inside and outside the city evacuated. Now, having returned to Suzhou after the disaster, I feel especially happy. Therefore, the crowding of the small food markets on that day was inversely proportional to the lack of interest in the food displayed three months ago. Except for party and government organs and schools of all sizes, which were restricted by the ban and continued to work and hold classes as usual, other industrial and commercial sectors took advantage of the holiday to rest. Men in red and women in green flocked to the streets, causing traffic jams. All the entertainment venues inside and outside the city tripled their profits. Huang Maoquan, the first regiment commander of the 119th brigade of the 60th division of the 19th Route Army stationed in Suzhou, witnessed this situation and marveled at the rare sight.</p>

<p>Gu Tinglin said, "The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every man." I would say, "It is especially the responsibility of every woman." Rejecting extravagant clothing, accessories, and utensils, and being diligent and thrifty to encourage men will create a good social atmosphere, cultivate the nation's vitality, and ensure world peace. Is this not the responsibility of us women? I hope that my fellow women will not dismiss this as a cliché.</p>
<p>Appendix 1: Recently, I read "The Handbook for Getting Rich" written by Western doctor Wang Licai, which describes the story of his great-great-grandmother, Zhang Taiyi, who was known for her chastity and filial piety. She spun twelve taels of yarn every day, earning fifty copper coins. After providing food for her aunt, two children, and herself, she was still able to save money to pay off her debts. Note: Two hundred years ago, prices were low. With one copper coin, one could buy a bowl of sauce, vinegar, oil, and wine at a sauce shop, which was called "four bowls for one coin." The price of white rice was only two coins per liter. See Lu Jiaoshu's story by Qi Fan Niu. Jie comments: The story of Zhang Yi's chastity and filial piety began in the 29th year of the Qianlong era. At that time, the price of rice was already fifty coins per liter. Ordinary people could only spin six or seven taels of yarn per day, so the average daily income was only twenty or thirty coins. Therefore, the price of rice was about ten coins per liter. Emperor Gaozong made three tours of the south of the Yangtze River and liked to be extravagant, which cost the local people a lot of money. Social customs gradually became extravagant, and prices rose accordingly. Lu Jiaoshu's story took place during the Kangxi era, which proves the effectiveness of Emperor Shengzu's practice of thrift and frugality. However, two coins per liter of white rice refers to the extremely low price. According to Zhang Wenduan Cong Xun Zhai's words written in the 36th year of the Kangxi era, at that time, white rice cost four qian of silver per stone, which was only about four or five coins per liter. The land tax was low, and there were no taxes on other daily necessities. Moreover, farmers were able to work in peace, and industry and commerce were not engaged in luxury goods. This allowed agricultural products to increase, so prices were low, and farmers and merchants could still make a profit. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, prices were high, and people's lives were difficult. However, it only took twenty or thirty years to lower prices to this level, which shows the close relationship between prices and politics. Low prices make life easier and people happier. High prices make life difficult and people think of rebellion. Therefore, those who cannot make prices low and life easy are said to have bad politics. In other words, it is a failure to practice the Three People's Principles.</p>
<p>Therefore, he also led his troops to march through the streets in formation and held a full-group dinner at the Wang Feiji Public Sports Field in the city to observe the customs and enjoy the festivities. Although the dishes were not very exquisite, they were all exceptionally clean. The raising of cups and chopsticks was all done according to commands. The actions were uniform, and officers and soldiers enjoyed themselves together. The audience praised their strict military discipline and close-knit spirit. After the meal, they were led to the park for sightseeing. The strangest thing was that the people of Wu were timid and afraid of soldiers. Whenever they encountered soldiers, they would call them "gray camels" or "old soldiers" and avoid them from afar, afraid to interact with them. Unexpectedly, the actions of the tourists in the park on that day were completely different from usual. Not only did young men rush to talk with the soldiers about the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai, but even women and children approached the gun racks to examine the enemy's guns and cannons and admire the globally renowned bamboo hats. It showed that people regarded the soldiers of the 19th Route Army as fighting for national dignity and eliminating the great scourge for the people, and that they were truly the pillars of the country, unlike other military men who preyed on the people. When the regiment marched, in addition to using military music as a guide, it also used Cantonese gongs and drums, which was very lively. Therefore, the audience was as thick as a wall. Affection and aversion arise from the inherent nature of the people and cannot be forced by power. It is said that one convinces people with virtue, which is heartfelt and sincere. Seeing the attitude of the people of Wu towards the 19th Route Army, I am all the more convinced. I hope that those who wear tiger amulets in the country will take this as a warning and reorganize their troops so that the guns are aimed outward.</p>

<p>— Bao Zheng</p>
<p>Jinling is originally a scenic spot of the Six Dynasties. Since the government established its capital here, the market has become prosperous. The area around the Confucius Temple is lined with tea houses, and singing and music never cease. Every summer, pleasure boats on the Qinhuai River, following a long-standing tradition, also appear in season, no longer as desolate and lonely as before. Pleasure boats are divided into three types: large, medium, and small. The equipment inside the boats is all-encompassing. The prices vary depending on the time and needs. Once it is past dinner time, the banks of the Qinhuai River are filled with people, and the pleasure boats are as numerous as ants. In the sound of oars, the singing of orioles and the chirping of swallows can be faintly heard. The sounds of banter are everywhere. Most of these people are staff members of various agencies. They feel quite bored after work, so they gather two or three friends and flock to the pleasure boats, either to call prostitutes to drink wine or to brew tea to entertain guests. They talk about the past and the present, endlessly. Or they lie on the couch or take a nap on the veranda, looking up at the vastness of the universe and observing the prosperity of all things. At this time, the breeze is gentle, and the ripples are calm. They are carefree and happy. I, the reporter, briefly record this to tell the readers.</p>

<p>Chapter 10: Powerful Figures Abuse Their Authority, Relying on Kind Women for Comfort; Take the Short Route, Offer Bribes for Personal Gain, Generals Recruit Mountain Bandits</p>
<p>Let's talk about An Yutian sitting quietly in the reception room of the Aide-de-Camp Office in the military governor's headquarters, waiting for instructions. He had been sitting and waiting from one o'clock in the afternoon until after five o'clock. The aide-de-camp had not yet summoned him to go up to see Governor Ye, nor had he informed him that he would not be seen. He was just sitting there in the chair like a wooden statue, unable to move or walk. He was secretly complaining, fearing that he would turn into a petrified stone. Finally, he saw that many lucky people had been seen by the governor and left. The sky was gradually darkening, and no new people were coming in to sit down. Only about ten or so guests were left in the outer reception room, still waiting with gloomy faces like mud sculptures, hoping for news that was like a stone sinking into the sea. After all, he was young and energetic, unlike those old gentlemen in the next seats who had such deep cultivation. For a moment, he couldn't bear the hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and couldn't suppress his anxiety and resentment. He waited for the aide-de-camp to pass by him and suddenly stood up to stop him, wrinkling his brow and trembling his voice, he lowered his head and gently asked, "Excuse me, may I ask, did you pass my name card up? Will I be seen? Has the governor given any instructions?" The aide-de-camp moved a bundle of name cards to the side of the table, became furious, glared at him, raised his eyebrows, and spoke to him, "My dear sir, how can you ask me such a thing? How would I know? It is true that I eat the marshal's rice. Marshal Bai specially sent me to serve you gentlemen. I have to sit here for you gentlemen, and take out the name cards and say that you have official business to see the marshal. I have to run my legs off to report to the marshal one by one for you gentlemen. I don't have the guts to not pass your name card up. As for the marshal, he is very busy with official business and has many meetings. If everyone had to be seen as soon as they arrived, how could that be possible? We just have to compile a list of these name cards and send it to the marshal to look over. He will summon whoever he wants to see first. When he mentions someone, we will come down and announce it. We are just following orders and cannot make decisions on our own. Before he has spoken, how would I know if he will see you or not? Am I a worm in his stomach?" An Yutian was scolded and his face turned red from ear to ear. He was almost so embarrassed that he had nowhere to put his face. But he still endured his anger and said awkwardly, "Don't blame me, don't blame me, I have been waiting too long. I want to ask you to go up and ask again. If it can be done, it can be done. If it can't be done, then forget it. Why do you have to get so angry?"</p>

<h3 id="e202">Opium Public Sale <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" reported that Song is trying to implement the opium public sale again this time, after the proposal for public sale failed last year. His confidants Zhang Shouyong and Tang Haian are trying to carry out the public sale plan according to the plan set last year. If this is indeed the case, I have a few more words to say.</p>
<p>Everyone can talk about the harm opium does to the country and its people, so there is no need for me to say it again. However, there are special clauses in the law prohibiting opium, but private planting, transportation, and consumption have not disappeared. Moreover, some provinces have special tax offices, and some provinces force opium planting. Opium has always been an open secret. Now it is simply open, without having to hide it. That is not necessarily impossible.</p>
<p>However, since the country has issued a strict prohibition order, private planting, consumption, and transportation are still somewhat taboo and inconvenient. If it is made public, it will inevitably have a promotional nature. The number of smokers will inevitably increase suddenly. Originally, some people said that our country has become a "bandit" country. The explanation is that it refers to opium and bandits. If it is made public again, what kind of country will the country become? What kind of people will the people become?</p>
<p>If it is done for the sake of national income, and endured with pain, then there are many more nationalized businesses that can be done. For example, prostitution can also be made public, and gambling can be specially taxed. Once promoted, the effect will be huge. In this way, it will become a country of "bandits, gamblers, and prostitutes." Please close your eyes and think about what kind of phenomenon it will become. It will make our Republic of China forever sink into the abyss, with no daylight to be seen.</p>
<p>Of course, if the government really has this determination to promote it, then the previous failure due to poor planning will be remedied with a better plan. I can only optimistically hope for success and celebrate the happiness of the country's future.</p>

<h3 id="e204">The Principles of Photography <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Qian</p>
<p>The use of photography is very broad, and it is used in science, military affairs, law, and art. The various techniques involved contain extremely profound theories, which cannot be explained in a few words. I will now explain the principles of common procedures as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Focusing: Before taking a photo, it is necessary to focus on the ground glass. Because the image has a certain focal point, the ground glass must be placed precisely at the focal point to make the image clear. Focusing is aligning the focal point to make the image very clear.</p>
<p>(2) Photography: After focusing, a dry plate holder can be installed for photography. When photographing, the lens is opened to allow light to shine on the dry plate.</p>
<p>The dry plate is coated with a compound like silver bromide, which changes when exposed to light.</p>
<p>(3) Developing: Although the emulsion on the dry plate changes, it is invisible to the eye. To turn the image into a black shadow, it must undergo the action of a chemical solution.</p>
<p>The developing solution is a chemical reducing agent. When the dry plate is immersed in the developing solution, the silver bromide that has been exposed to light is reduced to silver particles, revealing the black shadow of the scene. White objects reflect light strongly, so more silver particles are reduced. The white clothes we wear appear as dark black images on the dry plate. Black objects, such as hair, reflect very little light, so the dry plate changes little, and the image becomes blank.</p>
<p>(4) Fixing: Although the image has been developed, the dry plate cannot be exposed to white light, otherwise the image will turn completely black. The developed dry plate must be immersed in a fixing solution to dissolve all the unexposed silver bromide. Then, only the black image remains on the negative. After washing and drying, it becomes the "negative" seen in photography.</p>
<p>(5) Printing: The image on the negative is the opposite of the real object. White clothes are black, and black hair is blank. Therefore, a printing process is required to obtain an image that is the same as the real object. Printing involves placing a photosensitive paper under the negative and exposing it to light. The hair area is blank on the negative, so more light passes through. White clothes are black on the negative, so less light passes through. Following the principle of developing, we process the photosensitive paper in developing and fixing solutions to obtain a "positive image" that is the same as the real object.</p>
<p>The number of people in our country who know how to take photos is increasing every day, but all the raw materials and equipment used are foreign products. The amount of money flowing out every year is certainly not small. Now, Chinese people can manufacture photosensitive paper, and some simple equipment can also be made domestically. However, the most important "dry plates" and "cameras" have not been touched at all. The Japanese have long been able to make their own "dry plates." It is hoped that photography enthusiasts in our country will pay more attention to this.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Chinese Language Class <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Clang, clang, clang! The Chinese language class at C School's D classroom has begun. An old gentleman wearing a pair of "horse's foot" glasses nervously walks onto the stage. When he calls the roll, all the students in the grade should be present, but after he finishes calling the roll and looks up, one-third of the students have already slipped out through the side door. He happily lectures on the platform, but the students below continue to slip away one by one. In the end, only five or six students remain out of dozens. Although they play this farce every Chinese language class, this time, because too many students left, it could not escape the notice of the old gentleman with dull eyes. He noticed the students slipping away and began to interrogate the remaining few, but they all refused to tell him. His pent-up anger suddenly flared up, and he slammed the desk, dropped the book, and shouted the old tune of "national slaves." He went to the academic affairs office to report to the principal, but the next day, the principal did not express anything.</p>
<p>The third day, the old gentleman came to teach Chinese language class, and the students continued to slip away one after another.</p>
<p>Chinese students' dislike of studying Chinese has long become a very common thing. Here, I am reminded of a joke from my student days. The year we graduated, there were a total of twenty-two students in the class. On the day of the Chinese composition exam, some of the students did not know how to write, and they were extremely anxious. Finally, one student wrote seven compositions for them. I also wrote three compositions for them. But the joke happened because, in three hours, it was impossible to write several good compositions. I used a pencil to write a draft for them and passed it on as a perfunctory task. Who knew that the friend sitting in front of me transcribed many of the cursive characters on my draft paper incorrectly. As a result, after submitting the paper, the teacher noticed it and marked it as a failure. He did not receive a high school diploma because of this, even after six years of hard work. At first, I wholeheartedly wanted to help him, but in the end, I harmed him. This matter has left me feeling somewhat sad to this day. But here, we can also see the general Chinese proficiency of middle school students. Not to mention writing, they can even copy incorrectly. The reason is that they usually dislike Chinese language class and are unwilling to write compositions.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Four Screws <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Wei</p>
<p>Once, I went to a barber shop for a haircut. About a quarter of an hour after I sat down, another customer came in. I heard Xiao Sanzi, who was cutting my hair, say, "Four screws." At the same time, a barber reluctantly went up to cut the customer's hair.</p>
<p>I heard the phrase "four screws" and saw the barber's extremely unhappy expression. I knew that the phrase must be their secret code and that it must be related to that customer. So, I wanted to ask them, but I didn't. Later, I saw that the customer's haircut and shave were finished before mine. So, I couldn't help but ask Xiao Sanzi, "What does 'four screws' mean?" I said, "Oh, that means four 'eight-open' (referring to eight 5-cent coins)."</p>
<p>"You said that phrase was probably related to that customer."</p>
<p>"Yes, that guy always only gives four 'eight-open.' I've cut his hair twice, and he always gives so little. So, I told them not to waste their effort."</p>
<p>"You're being too unfair. Four 'eight-open' is already the price you set," I said, as if defending the customer.</p>
<p>"It's not wrong, sir, but we always hope that customers will give a little more so that we can earn more when we split the earnings."</p>
<p>Hearing this, I secretly said "shame." Fortunately, I have always given them six "eight-open," otherwise, I would probably hear the call of "four screws" next time I came in, or even see their extremely unhappy expressions.</p>

<p>— Wu Wei</p>
<p>Shanghai is a prosperous metropolis and one of the world's largest commercial centers. Nanjing Road is the most bustling place in all of Shanghai. The shop windows are always filled with cosmetics, consumer goods,</p>
<p>fabrics, such as modern silk, georgette, and jersey, etc., especially supplies for women. It is almost impossible to find a store that specializes in men's supplies, which shows that women's extravagance is even greater than men's. Because the more of these stores there are, the higher the degree of women's extravagance is shown. The establishment of these stores is, of course, due to demand, but at the same time, men's burdens have also increased.</p>
<p>My old classmate S earns a monthly salary of 120 yuan. Normally, maintaining a small family would be more than enough. However, he told me that he always felt that it was not enough because his wife alone spends 80 to 90 yuan a month. Her expenses include silk stockings costing several yuan each, two or three pairs a month; perfume (White Rose) at least one bottle a month; leather shoes one pair a month (at the very least); cigarettes (Five Flowers brand) ten dimes a month; and fabrics and face powder. She alone spends half of his salary each month. I heard that S's wife is an extremely modern woman. She thinks that it is nothing for a woman to spend this much. But, alas! In today's society, it is probably not easy for a man to bear so much.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Jianhua,</p>
<p>I am writing to express my admiration for your ambition in industry. I have investigated and found that erasers are not yet made in China, but this is a commonly used item that is bought in small quantities at high prices. If we add up the amount used nationwide, a large amount of money flows out of the country. I am also impressed by your ambition to engage in manufacturing and recover these profits. However, I have no research on rubber manufacturing. I will answer your inquiries to the best of my knowledge as follows: (1) It is not very suitable for small-scale home industry manufacturing. (2) The amount of money needed to open a factory depends on the size of the factory and is related to various issues such as the size of the machines, location, and labor costs. It is difficult to estimate accurately. At a minimum, at least 7,000 to 8,000 yuan would be needed. (3) The chemical formula for rubber is CioHi6, which is a hydrogen-carbon substance. Its analyzed composition should be published in a separate scientific article. The above is a brief reply. Because I am still studying and do not have much free time, the letter is not very detailed. I apologize for this.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>(1) To the Editor: In a recent article published in your esteemed newspaper entitled "Simple and Easy Small-Scale Industry" by Naizheng, there was a section on making cologne with 50 parts alcohol, 3 parts ammonia, and 3 parts fragrance (or menthol). I tried using 3.3 cents of ammonia water, half a pound of alcohol, and 3.3 cents of menthol to mix, but the ammonia water had a pungent smell that did not disappear after mixing. Therefore, I am writing to ask you to publish a method for removing the odor in your esteemed newspaper so that I can try again. Sincerely, Chen Zhaozhou, June 12th</p>
<p>Correction: There were many errors in yesterday's article "How to Install a Lightning Rod." We hereby make the following corrections!</p>
<p>(1) In the phrase "Because the underground 'feels' damp," the word "feels" should be changed to "becomes." (2) In the phrase "using inductive action," the word "using" should be removed. (3) In the phrase "neutralizes the cloud," the words "negative electricity" should be added after the word "the." (4) In the phrase "whether it carries positive electricity or not," the word "cloud" should be added after the word "whether." (5) In the phrase "If the cloud carries positive electricity to the vicinity of the rod," the word "electricity" should be used instead of "carries" after the word "positive." (6) In the phrase "writes into the ground," the word "writes" should be changed to "discharges."</p>
