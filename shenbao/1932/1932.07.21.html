<p>（往事不忘。後事之師）能常念往事。庶幾覆軌不至再蹈而可以日即於自新自振之途惟有若毫無血氣之健忘者。乃長困於覆滅之泥淖而永永末由自拔。個人如此。推以至於一民族亦無不如此。</p>
<p>我民族最大之病根即爲健忘惟有健忘故我民族長困於危難險惡之艱局。今且危若纍卵不要終朝誠然。吾人言此。或亦有若純唯心論者之偏論。且或因以糢糊一般人之正確目標。然而就事實言。則我民族之宴安熓毒。遷延苟安。但顧目前。不知回溯過去。亦不知遠瞻將來。（樂天知命。）醉生夢死。無自信力。無鬥爭之精神。則亦爲可諱言。</p>
<p>以方國難。實不始於今日。自鴉片一戰而後。我國即無日不在難中。嚮使我民族能懲於鴉片戰爭之失敗。發奮圖强。則今日何至國難重重而不能自拔。由阻遏鴉片流毒而發生鴉片戰爭。由鴉片戰敗締結南京條約。此辱國喪權之不平等條約。經悠久之長歲月。尙未能廢除。今人又倡言鴉片公賣而恬不爲怪。健忘熟有甚於此者。近百年來。世界日加速之步武向前突躍猛進對於弱小民族之宰割。亦日益兇殘然。而我國人則長年酣夢沉沉。茫然罔覺。禍變一來。則驚惶莫知所措。迨事過境遷。則復返於沉沉酣夢。絶不措意此健忘之證也。</p>
<p>自九一八禍發。繼之以淞滬之變國人固亦慷慨悲歌。發揚蹈厲敵愾同仇。人具此心。義勇軍决死隊之組織。日貨之抵制。餉糈之捐輸。開會游行。通電呼籲。民氣之激昂。實爲空前所未見。但今日敵旗猶飄搖於東北。滬戰之破壞亦歷歷在目。而所謂義勇軍與决死隊。已不知何往矣。日貨之進口亦已恢復其原狀。突躍至第一位矣。金迷紙醉。奢靡依舊。酣歌漫舞荒淫猶昔。東北之淪亡。滬戰之茶毒。一切都已置諸腦後。此健忘之交一證也。</p>
<p>長此健忘。終將無以自存。遷延苟安苟。安終不可得。當前熱河告急。平津亦警訊頻傳。即其明證。國人宜從茲覺悟。宜深刻往事於心頭。尤宜深體往事之敎訓。彼持不抵抗主義。斷送東北之（長官。）今茲决不足以固守華北。不忘往事。庶幾乃能處理當前之事變。</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語录福紀</p>
<p>吾對于宗敎有了堅决的信仰，對于科學才發生特</p>
<p>殊的興趣。吾俯仰宇宙，才瞻仰造物主的偉大。我們人類得天獨厚，就成爲萬物之靈。人類可以研究萬物，萬物確不能研究人類。吾常痴想，以宇宙之大，太陽居其間，在地球上的人類看起來也夠大了。然而太陽究竟有多少大，太陽能自已知道麽？吾想到這裏，就指着太陽，嘲笑他一陣·，</p>
<p>（太陽啊！太陽！</p>
<p>吾認得你，你不認得吾·，</p>
<p>吾非但認得你，</p>
<p>吾還認得吾自已。）</p>
<p>能認得自已的祇有人，所以人才是萬物之靈。人是萬物之靈，人能認得自已，於是人能辨善惡。有人說·，（善惡是無定的，是習慣所造成的。）吾以爲不然，有事爲證·，</p>
<p>小孩子見着賣糖担，嘴吧儘管埀涎欲滴，袋裏没有錢，還是不敢伸出小</p>
<p>手去拿，父親拿錢出來買了，糖就在小孩手裏，誰想去搶他的糖，他就要大哭。小孩是人，小孩有靈，小孩知名分，小孩能認得自已。</p>
<p>反之，張三的狗肚子餓了，看見李四的東西。就搶着吃，畜生那裏有張三李四之分。在這裏就可以看出人和畜生的分别，也是人之有靈的有力證明。</p>

<p>君在滬任事。生子殤。去冬。暴日侵滬。日僑紛紛歸。吉田向某君告别。某君强挽之。吉田雖亦懋懋。以格於勢。不得留。某君但感私情。竟忘國仇。至欲密隨吉田去。其弟亦在滬。聞之。急召兄至。幽之别室。而遺吉</p>
<p>田行。詭云。祖母在籍病危。兄已下輪歸矣。蓋深知其兄迷惘。非言辭所能動。故用此霹靂手也。吉田旣去乃還兄自由。而謂之曰。古人有言。怨耦曰仇。今兄之事。當倒轉說。仇曰怨耦。兄不畏身敗名裂。獨不顧良心乎。某君知事已無可奈何。乃謝弟曰。我一時神經錯亂。非弟深愛我實無</p>

<p>— 石子</p>
<p>客夏余曾作瓜話。謂我國内政不修宛如一西瓜之内心腐蝕。而强鄰環伺。一旦操刀而試。實行瓜分。則此内腐之西瓜。將并軀殼而不保矣。此本一時有感而作。不圖不旋踵而九一八事發。將我整個中華剜去東北一部。不幸而言中。其可痛爲何如。荏苒經年。又逢盛暑。追憶及此。汗浹於背。爰不敢再妄肆臆斷。姑拉雜漫書一二。以爲炎夏之點綴。</p>
<p>兒時偶得一烏皮西瓜。輒去其頂。而以匙剜去瓜瓤。留皮極薄。乃以犀利之小刀。於外皮上。刻成絶細之花紋。更於刻紋中。略施色澤。内燃短燭。懸諸簷前。納凉其下。清風係來。溽署盡退。時或浮於池中。游魚爭相追逐。頗饒奇趣。年來依人壓綫。無暇返　暑。追維兒時情景。不禁爲之神往。</p>
<p>農人種植西瓜。收豐價昂之年。採而運銷滬瀆。畝可獲利百元左右。故我鄉（崑山之東）農人。年必植西瓜數畝。若可獲利。則一歲衣食。可以無虞。惟裁植西瓜。頗具投機性。究不若植棉種稻之穏妥。因西瓜田中。　類極多。成羣而出。可於一小時内。將十畝瓜田。蹂躪殆遍。故農人終夜輪流守望。以防畜類。而同時更可防宵小。迨瓜旣成熟。乃載運來申。苟斯時也。適値連朝陰雨。赤帝藏踪。西瓜復無</p>
<p>術久擱。祇得廉値傾售。則虧蝕者有之。我人買瓜。價賤則笑逐顏開。殊不知農人忘餐廢寢。而所得之代價。恐猶不足繳租償債（西瓜所需肥料極貴（之資也。</p>
<p>我人食西瓜。率多將皮棄去。實則將瓜皮去瓤留皮二分厚。漬鹽少許。約五六小時後。入醬醃之。（即豆瓣醬亦可。）約一晝夜。取出佐餐。清香鮮嫩。其味極佳。而尤合於夏日忌食油膩者之口胃。此亦廢物利用之一也。讀者盍一試之。</p>

<p>（九）臭藥水廠</p>
<p>臭藥水。以松香克利沙。（殺蟲藥品）同一度量。加入苛性鈉百分之零三。經過二次之蒸濾。即告成功。</p>
<p>查克利沙製法。取煤膏置鐵鍋中。加以劇烈之燃燒。須自自一百九十度至二百七十度之間。則原質變化。成一種克利沙矣。外科用之來沙而。及納夫脫林。均係在克利沙中提出製成者。臭藥水爲夏令必需用品。功能殺蟲除臭。往者臭藥水一項。大多來自日本。自國貨臭藥水製</p>
<p>售後。日貨已擯絶市塲。現在上海製造藥水者。有亞林藥水廠。其出品係顯微鐃牌。亞細亞藥水廠。其出品係雙刀牌。他若老鷹牌等等。亦皆著名。大者每桶裝四十介侖。市價一介侖呵。每呵價洋一元三角。半介侖叮者七角。爪得介侖四角。</p>
<p>製臭藥水廠。往往兼製樟腦丸。其製法。即用上述之納夫脫林。再用法精練之。提出一種白色塊片。用機壓之。即成樟腦丸。每磅買洋二角。此係衣廚書篋中必備之品。藉免蟲蛀者也。</p>
<p>（十）陽傘工廠</p>
<p>上海製造陽傘者。多分工合作。所有桿柄骨面。均由各該業工廠製造。由陽傘工廠。買來裝製之。惟華利時一家多數係自製。内中製骨較複雜。上海有專門製造傘骨工廠三四家。若小西門之三星傘骨廠等是也。骨以元鐵絲或鋼絲。用機軋之車之鑽之。每打價洋二元至二元不等。分黑白二色。及三尺二尺八寸等别。</p>
<p>桿以洋松製者較多。每根價洋三分至四分。柄質不一。或以木製。或以金屬製。或以賽珍品製</p>
<p>。往時皆日貨。近多改用國貨矣。最普通之木柄。每打價洋九角上下。</p>
<p>面用料。亦不一。二三等貨。多用黑色廠布。每疋四十碼者。市價洋十元有零。頭等貨傘面。多用西洋斜缎。女傘則用綢面矣。</p>
<p>上海陽傘工廠。有三十餘家。大者如華利時新大陸新大同民華振華美利等等。每廠每日出貨七八十打。或二三十打不等。價目每打十一元至二十餘元。女用綢傘。每打有五六十元者。工以件計。如踏邊每頂洋二分。上頂每傘洋一分等。傘頂上後。須用蒸汽一度蒸烘。於是傘面伏貼。經久耐用矣。</p>

<p>必要時將遼關日員全撤革自大連及東北各關稅收被日人嗾使僞國攫奪後我方曾兩度向日本提出嚴重抗議最近梅總稅務司以日本對大連關事迄無正式答復已决定待期實行封鎖關於償還外債一事政府已與各關係國商得同意决减成償付至封鎖後之過渡辦法則仍照舊辦理</p>
<p>減償外債東北各關被攫全國稅收方面平均每年約損失三千九百餘萬元以此項稅收爲抵押之外債之償還驟蒙極大影響日本蔑視我政府主權以爲我將應付無策竟然宣傳所謂調停辦法以掩飾其嗾使僞國攫奪之罪名此種所謂調停辦法非特爲我政府所難承認且亦爲各關係國不能接受者然對於償付辦法外財兩部提出减成償還之辦法與各關係國磋商結果各國已完全同意惟所减成數則尙未定各方仍在進行磋商中大致將以東北稅收數目爲比例計算應减若干成</p>
<p>遼關封鎖據確訊自總稅務司提出岸本繼任福本爲大連海關稅務司徵求日方同意日方迄無正式答復上次日方宣傳機關所傳之拒絶同意消息係含有作用梅總稅務司曾兩次向日使館催詢外業已下哀的美敦書式之最後警告刻正靜候此項答復如日方到期仍無答覆或有答覆而不能認爲滿意時我方决毅然速行封鎖東北各關同時並將發表聲明說明責任至封鎖後善後辦法各國均無問題各國並未承認僞國自然以我國之關稅組織合法僞國如征收二重稅時則尤爲向大連南滿路及東北其他各商業界投一巨量炸彈此種未來之事實實恐非日政府所能逆料者也</p>
<p>過渡辦法前日稅務當局對封鎖東北關稅前過渡辦法商議之結果聞决定仍照舊有之普通辦法辦理蓋因當局預料日方如不答覆實行封鎖時爲時必不久故在此最短期中似無須出此</p>
<p>開革日員大連關稅務司福本違抗命令自免職後所有大連及東北其他各關日籍關員均相率效尤梅樂和對此極爲憤槪曾於發表罷免福本稅務司職之聲明中言及此事經當局磋商之結果已决定如東北各關稅不得圓滿解决時其他日籍關員除有特殊情形者外悉予革職防患未來</p>
<p>日言爲難日方嗾使僞國攫奪關稅初未料及我國尙有此舉因謬然行之旣施行後則又感覺我方態度之强硬連日對福本免職岸本繼任之事延無表示此舉據外交界人認即係一種恐懼之表示蓋日方此時正左右爲難如對岸本新大連稅務司之繼任表示同意則東北各關之被攫又明明表示日方承認其爲嗾使否則我方實行封鎖則僞關並無若何利益而東北之日商業尤其爲大連市及南滿鐵路必受重大打擊云</p>

<p>駭浪之中保持其獨立精神不可謂非三省員工及負責人之力也</p>
<p>日人佈置日人見迭次破壞之不得遂其心願遂唆使僞國積極佈置非法刦奪茲據總局所得報告日人刻已代僞國印就大批郵票運至遼陽·並委就大批僞局長僞督察官督察員其郵票聞决於八月一日發行至是否於八月日强行派員刦奪各局刻尙末得續報惟其由日方召來之熟練郵務員則現正分發各重要區域候命</p>
<p>政府决心我政府對日人之唆使僞國奪我東北郵權固已早經顧及故業經準備就緒交部於日前復爲具體計劃之决定惟因事關外交秘密故不便發表總之東北郵政乃東北交通經濟之重要命脈我决不能任人刦奪無論如何至必要時我决將東北郵政全體封鎖亦所不惜也云云</p>

<p>收回引水權我國引水權久落外人之手上年滬航界曾呈請財交海三部請求收回以戰事突起無形中止昨日駕駛會各執監會議以引水權如果上年爭回一二八戰事日兵安能偷上瀏河而日艦又奚能自由出入浦江在國防上尤須積極收還引水權也當議决收回辦法四條（一）請交部立卽全部收回收水權將外籍引水解約（二）以後領港公會如有引水員出缺或增加引水名額册應儘用國人（三）以後領港公會關于引水問題磋商應有華人加入（四）上年海關方面所允增加中國領港五名一案應卽履行此項議决案卽日備呈請交部力爭</p>
<p>自辦商校事吳淞商船學校經費原由各航商公攤係按照所有船隻增收噸位附捐充作校費者商校造就之人材則供華輪自用現由航會公决商校經費請由中央負担各輪所納之附稅應請撤消以後航商自籌經費自立商校而造成之航海人才關係更爲秘密</p>
<p>又上海航政局之經費亦請中央撥給勿再使滬航商担負卽日呈部請求</p>
<p>催發航債案航業公債一千萬元早經中央核定迄今尙未頒發今年戰事發生上海航輪公司受損失者四十三家損失達四百七十餘萬元現在航業清衰請中央速將一千萬元公債尅日發下以便補助而免瀕于破產</p>
<p>增添旅客簿航政局長何瀚瀾接事後便函令各輪局以後江海各輪之乘客應照各國郵船增添旅客名册便于稽查當時航會</p>
<p>曾開會議討論此事以中國輪行駛地點短程者多乘客散漫殊難一一豋册請求免辦今航局又來函二次催促命各輪先將一二等旅客名册務必增置航會已令各輪局照辦矣</p>
<p>此外尙有限制貧民乘輪名額一案此事已决定先請官廳取締並再規定各輪之乘搭名額云</p>

<h3 id="c212">顧維鈞在濟談話 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>顧維鈞氏十八日在濟南車站，對記者談話，他談話中最重要的意思，就是這樣兩句··</p>
<p>外交軍事，賴政府主持，民衆恊助，最近日貨日增，</p>
<p>國人將何以自解？</p>
<p>這兩句話，完全不差，但我還要漂漂明白，自九一八，一二八車變以後，我國人受日軍之重大壓迫，重大破壞，實爲我國歷史上所未見，現在中國人再，要去推銷日貨，眞是醉生夢死，喪盡天良，但此事不能怪一般民衆，最壞的就是幾個利欲薰心的好商，而一般民衆，一則僅圖小利，一則缺乏鑑别能力，我國國民之不長進，原無以自解，然而政府亦不能不負其責，滬上之抗日舉動，不知因何而忽寂然耶？</p>
<p>若外交軍事，須賴政府主持，這原是當然的事，不賴政府，將賴誰呢，但是政府能賴不能賴，到是一個問題，自九一八事變以來，長期抵抗收回失地等等標語，早已耳熟能詳，然而如何收回，如何抵抗，至今尙懸諸我人腦海之中，而未曾夢見也，現在日軍又欲進窺熱河，砲炸朝陽城，形勢十分險惡，素來主張不抵抗的軍事長官，天然絶無救藥，不過號稱長期抵抗收回失地的軍事長官，應作若何之表示呢！</p>
<p>至於民衆恊助一層，倒可不必顧慮，試看占馬山奮勇抗日，民衆如何恊助，十九路軍奮勇抗日，民衆又如何恊助，這種恊助，完全出於人民之自動，在這一點看來，民衆對於愛國觀念，何等熱切，倘政府果能出兵，收回失地，則人民之恊助，定必倍形踴躍，現在人民並非不恊助，實呌做愛莫能助。</p>
<p>至於内地人民不滿於中央之所爲，大抵亦在於此，若中央一旦調動大軍，黄龍直搗，無論反動軍與共產軍，苟有乘機搗亂，希圖破壞者，我人民當一致</p>
<p>起而共棄之！</p>

<p>— 杜鳳樓</p>
<p>無端掀起惡干戈，暴骨如山血染河。舊日繁榮空想像，積年文獻付逝波。重來海燕完巢少，新畫哀鴻歷刦多。爲問憂時醫國手，救災扶困計如何。</p>

<p>男兒衛國執干戈，當法孤軍去黑河。豈得苟安貪半壁，仍甘媚敵送微波。戰時恨聽援聲少，和後頻聞笑語多。我未疆塲裏馬革，悲歌慷慨又如何。</p>

<h3 id="c215">人造大理石 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 羅席琴</p>
<p>大理石在建築上和工藝界用途非常廣漠，珍貴儕於連城，而其產額，則有地域其他關係之定限，初非若花崗石等容易隨地征取而不虞消竭也。</p>
<p>外國如何，且勿具論，禹域以内，吾國豐藴大理石之區，還祇　南之大理及湖南之祁陽，但皆以偏藏腹地，不易源源供給　海數大通商工業都市之需，以是而論推動吾人生活之近代化，有歧途横列於開拓邁進者之前，其一係努力於科學上的製作，另一則以鉅額金錢乞憐於友邦之剩餘矣。</p>
<p>人造大理石，即吾人以科學方法，製成類似天然大理石成功試騐之一種，倘有相當工具，配以精細技術，從事以下之序列，結果常使獻身工藝界之勇士，獲得應有之自慰，</p>
<p>（一）材料（Ａ）純白之士敏土滬市有出售者，大致係舶來品，價比普通用作三合混凝土之洋灰貴一倍有餘，其實是項土敏土與普通之土敏土製法，無甚差異，不過須選取純凈之石灰石（如方解石）及純粹之矽酸礬土（如高嶺土磁土）爲原料，於其前後混和粉粹時，不使其直接摩擦鐵器（以堅硬之石器或陶器代替）工作，防鐵屑混入毁其潔白也，（Ｂ）晶瑩有稜之石英碎塊用大小兩種網目不同之篩篩過，取其體積均匀之中層備用，（Ｃ）磨研極細之金屬養化物顏料，溶解於水，和日久褪色之有機物顏料，均不適用，</p>
<p>一樣熱天，幾樣却暑。廬山荳棚，各異其趣。佛題</p>
<p>肉紅色用安母尼亞沈澱之鹽化第一錫一分，養化鋅一分，養化鋁一分，匀和入耐火土坩堝煆燒即得，</p>
<p>天青色養化鈷○五分，養化鋁二分，養化鋅一分五，煆燒之，</p>
<p>翠綠色養化鉻○五分，養化鋅二分，燒硼砂二分，共磨匀入坩堝，煆燒後洗滌研細備用，註··以上三種顏料，加低温度的煤熔劑，適用於陶瓷器之𥑤上，及玻璃器上之繪畫，</p>
<p>（二）工具（Ａ）用白鐵皮按照桌面挿屏等大小形式銲成的淺盤，（Ｂ）用燒石膏，石蚋等翻鑄好的造像，及其他雕刻之陰模，即種型，（Ｃ）石蚋，松香，牛脂，松節油，（Ｄ）和土敏土用的大木桶調顏料用的瓦鉢，熔蠟用的鐵鍋，攬棒，（Ｅ）磨光用的荆山石粉，（磨玉器玻璃均用此粉）脚踏磨盤，</p>
<p>（三）處理茲先述人造平面大理石版之施工，取上製之白鐵淺盤，塗上用鐵鍋熔化石蠟松香牛脂之光滑劑令乾，置於平台上，再取秤妥適量之白土敏土七分，晶瑩之石英砂三分，入木桶加水調如糊狀，傾入盤内，盪振使平待乾，硬化後，用熱水温鉛盤之底面，蠟即熔化，而易脫落，用荆山石粉和水於光滑平正之磨石上刀磨之，即得晶瑩潔白之平</p>
<p>版大理石矣，</p>
<p>如欲紅色筋絡紋狀之大石，則宜於和土敏土時，另用一鉢和成粉紅色之土敏土漿，（加上列肉紅色顏料）冲入大木桶内，巧妙地攬如絡紋花狀，傾入白鐵盤内令乾，今青色紋狀同一手續，惟改顏料</p>
<p>如欲得翠綠色的山水花紋，亦可恃潑墨成龍之巧手，獲自已努力收獲也，關於造像鑄模之手術，吾將於另節述雕塑蠟人，及石膏工藝時詳論之，但如鑄成人造大理石之雕像，亦不出上述製平版大理石調製方法也，</p>
<p>有　不餘</p>
<h3 id="c216">虚驚 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 征樓舊主</p>
<p>我有一個姓金的朋友，和我同在涇</p>
<p>縣胡懷琛先生處補習國文，他是個很誠實的青年，他的父親，是在本埠西鄉開設着一個店舖。他中學畢業了，他的父親就不許他升學，呌他襄助襄助店務··可是他愛好文藝，求學心切。雖然没有跨進崇階百尺的大學裏去繼續求學·，終於加入了胡先生所設的國文補習科。另外他還在某夜校肄業。晚上就躭擱在上海他的朋友家裏。</p>
<p>他平日喜歡閱讀坊間所出版的圖書雜誌。不論新舊，不問好夕，遇到了新</p>
<p>出版的刋物，他總要買來一讀。因此這一次的虚驚，也是受了濫讀雜誌不加識别的懲戒！因爲他最近看到了一種文藝雜誌，裏面載着西門路某某文藝社，徵求社員的一條消息。就打動了他愛好文藝的心思，就在昨天（十九日）的清晨，從他寄寓的朋友家裏出來，乘了自備的脚踏車，直到了西門路所謂某某文藝社裏去，討份章程看看。</p>
<p>他到了裏面，就有一個人守着，對他說··（你在樓上等等吧！章程我去找來），他正在樓上老等着，一霎時便來了許多中西探捕，把他圍住了，首先一個華探，便問他道，（你不是來送死嗎？你爲什麽要加入共黨）他這時眞像丈二和尙，摸不着頭腦。原來所謂某某文藝社者，是一個共黨的機關，已在前天破獲了，這時捕房中正在守候着同黨。見了他這們早的來討章程，疑心他是赤色分子。因此不容分說，捉他到嵩山路巡捕房。拿出了許多照片，問他··（這些人你認識不認識）？他說··（我是來討章程的，委實不知道這麽一回事）！後來他書包裏抄出了一封寫給胡懷琛先生的信。（預備投入郵筒的）捕房中認爲有查詢的需要，就派了許多探捕，伴着他到福履理路胡先生家裏，把安居白屋中的胡老師！嚇了一跳！尤其是家人們　後來經胡先生向捕房中人證明他的人品履歷，就一夥兒退出了胡宅，再带他到捕房，當局的就告誡他道··（你以後要留心些現在去吧？）一塲虚驚，就此結束。</p>

<h3 id="c218">極應注意的鄉村衛生一萍 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>據說今年天氣是八年來未有之大熱，我的一個同學提議，到鄉下去暫住幾時，但是鄉下也是一樣的熱，不過牛車棚的風味使人頭腦不致腐化，本來都市和鄉村，曾有人著專書討論，内容也一樣注重牛車棚風味，而没有注意鄉村的衛生，我們雖然祇住了三天，可是注意到一件十分悽慘的事，或者正是鄉村的哲學，</p>
<p>到鄉下的第二天，來了一個巡警和穿制服的醫生，他們挨户勸道打防疫針，講了一天篇的暑天的虎烈拉多麽可怕，尤其今年大戰後，疫癘更甚，我們是Ｘ縣派來的，施送打針，並不收費，但是任你唇焦舌碎，他們農民都像吃官司一樣的怕打，都搖搖頭的逃開，</p>
<p>我們兩個本來在上海打過第一針，就請他們打了第二針，農民們都竊竊私議，好像打了針是了不得的事，那巡警和醫生笑着對我們說也好回去銷差嗎，巡警和醫生走後，他們都圍攏來警告我們，</p>
<p>（那是日本人扮的啊，）更有一位老太太這樣說，</p>
<p>我們當然像演說一樣講給他們聽，夏天對於衛生應最注意，連小學校裏敎的（勿飲不潔之水，勿食生冷之物）等都說了出來，</p>
<p>（在洋學堂讀過書的都相信洋法，從前没有西醫，中國人不是也活命的嗎？我們鄉下人都吃河裏的冷水，晚上睡在牛車棚裏，也不聽見天天死人，醫生會打針，醫生自已難道會不死？）一位健而不美的農婦，竟像相駡一樣手指脚劃的大呌，</p>
<p>他们的話，我們也不可怎樣非難牠，在他們的目光中他們的理由很充足，所以於其說他們不注重衛生，還不如說中國的敎育没有普及的緣故，能夠每個人有四年或六年的强迫敎育，他們就會知道打防疫針，以及其他，是怎樣一回事。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Forgetful Bin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Remembering the past is a teacher for the future.) One can approach the path of self-renewal and self-strengthening only by constantly remembering the past, thereby ensuring that mistakes are not repeated. Only the forgetful, those devoid of vitality, remain trapped in the mire of destruction, unable to extricate themselves. This applies to individuals, and it is equally true for entire nations.</p>
<p>The greatest ailment of our nation is forgetfulness. It is because of forgetfulness that our nation remains trapped in difficult and dangerous situations. The situation is now as precarious as a pile of eggs that may not last even a morning. We say this, but perhaps there are those with purely idealistic views who consider this a biased opinion, and who may use it to obscure the correct goals of the general populace. However, factually speaking, the comfort-seeking, the slow-paced complacency, the preoccupation with the present without looking back at the past or forward to the future (living in contentment and knowing one's destiny), the living a life of drunken dreams, the lack of self-confidence, and the absence of a fighting spirit of our nation are undeniable.</p>
<p>Our national crisis did not begin today. Since the Opium War, our country has been in constant trouble. If our nation had learned from the failure of the Opium War and strived for strength, we would not be in such dire straits today, unable to extricate ourselves. The Opium War arose from the obstruction of the Opium poison, and the defeat in the Opium War led to the Treaty of Nanjing. This unequal treaty, humiliating the nation and forfeiting its rights, has yet to be abolished after a long period. Yet today, people advocate for the public sale of opium without any sense of shame. What could be more forgetful than this? In the past hundred years, the world has accelerated its pace forward, leaping and advancing rapidly. The subjugation of weak nations has become increasingly cruel. Yet our countrymen have remained in a long, deep sleep, unaware and unconcerned. When disaster strikes, they panic and are at a loss. Once the event has passed, they return to their deep sleep, paying no attention whatsoever. This is a sign of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, followed by the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the people have indeed sung慷慨悲歌, promoted with vigor, shared the hatred of the enemy, and showed a common will. Everyone possessed this spirit. The organization of volunteer armies and suicide squads, the boycott of Japanese goods, the donation of military funds, meetings, parades, telegrams, and appeals—the arousal of popular sentiment was unprecedented. But today, the enemy flag still flutters in the Northeast, and the destruction of the Shanghai war is still vivid in our minds. Yet, where are the so-called volunteer armies and suicide squads now? The import of Japanese goods has returned to its original state, even leaping to the top position. The pursuit of wealth and pleasure, the extravagance, the drunken singing, and the licentiousness continue as before. The fall of the Northeast and the devastation of the Shanghai war have all been forgotten. This is another sign of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Continuing in this state of forgetfulness will ultimately lead to our destruction. Prolonging a life of ease and comfort is ultimately unattainable. The current crisis in Rehe and the frequent alarming news from Peiping and Tianjin are clear evidence of this. The people of the country should awaken from this point forward. They should deeply engrave the past in their minds, and especially deeply understand the lessons of the past. Those who advocated a policy of non-resistance and lost the Northeast (officials) are now certainly insufficient to defend North China. Only by not forgetting the past can we handle the current crisis.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Air Squadron Bombs Chaoyang <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Six Japanese planes drop bombs, killing many residents</p>
<p>Two regiments of Japanese troops stationed in Jinzhou advance towards Beipiao</p>
<p>(Peiping) Japanese planes bombed Chaoyang on the 18th, killing more than 20 residents. On the 19th, six planes reconnoitered the Lingyuan area along the Rehe border. Yesterday, one regiment of Japanese troops attacked in the Datunkou area. All recent news reports from the Rehe area. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government received a telegram from Rehe stating that at 2:00 PM on the 18th, five Japanese planes bombed Chaoyang, dropping more than 30 bombs and strafing with machine guns for half an hour, killing and wounding dozens of people. At 2:30 PM, the planes flew back. It was also reported that five enemy planes flew to Chaoyang at 2:00 PM, bombing and strafing for about 30 minutes before leaving. The situation after the bombing is as follows: (1) Two bombs landed in the brigade headquarters, causing no casualties. (2) Five or six bombs landed in the mortar company, killing and wounding five or six personnel and more than 20 horses. (3) Five bombs landed near the telegraph office, three of which did not explode, shaped like mortar shells. (4) The number of bombs that landed on various businesses is unknown. In total, approximately 30 bombs were dropped. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) All troops stationed between Tianjin and Dezhou in the Northeast are being transferred to Tianjin. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway has prepared empty cars for transport, effective immediately. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) This morning, all Chinese newspapers here reported the tragedy in Chaoyang, confirming that six Japanese planes bombed Chaoyang on July 18th. The planes dropped a total of 30 bombs, all but three of which exploded, causing severe damage to the ground and killing several people. The planes then flew low and strafed with machine guns for approximately half an hour, resulting in many deaths. The exact number of casualties and the extent of the damage cannot yet be estimated. According to news from foreign sources received this afternoon, Japanese planes again bombed Chaoyang yesterday. Details are unknown. Dr. Wellington Koo told guests this afternoon that he had informed the League of Nations Investigation Commission in Qingdao yesterday about the activities of the Japanese in Rehe. The members made no comment. (20th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Two regiments of Japanese troops stationed in Jinzhou were dispatched on the 19th to advance towards Beipiao, and they also bribed more than 2,000 bandits to disrupt Huahuzhuang and other places, attempting to cut off the rear of the volunteer army. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Ishimoto Incident Is Pure Fabrication <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) More than 300 Japanese troops traveled from Yixian to Chaoyang on the 17th on two Shenyang railway cars. Japanese planes carried out extensive bombing, causing severe damage. The Japanese side claims that Ishimoto is missing, purely a deliberate fabrication used as a pretext for advancing troops. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang received a telegram from Tang Yulin, the chairman of Rehe, this afternoon stating that six Japanese planes bombed the official fields of Chaoyang yesterday, claiming that Ishimoto, an officer of the Kwantung Army, was detained by Chinese soldiers. Chinese officials have no knowledge of this matter. It is widely believed that the Ishimoto case is merely a pretext for the Japanese military to expand its ambitions. Furthermore, according to Japanese sources, Ishimoto was captured by the volunteer army in Beipiao. Since Beipiao is located within (Manchukuo), the responsible party should be the Japanese, not the Chinese. Moreover, only the volunteer army is engaged in combat with the Japanese army; no official government troops have joined. However, if the Japanese army attempts to seize Rehe, Tang Yulin is prepared to resist with all his forces. The Japanese army has approximately 6,000 to 8,000 troops stationed in Jinzhou and Chaoyang. According to local newspaper reports, in the past week, Mongol bandits, instigated by Japanese military personnel, have repeatedly engaged in minor conflicts. The rumor that the Japanese army will invade Rehe sooner or later is gaining credence. Foreign sources are currently unable to determine whether the Ishimoto case is merely an unrelated incident or the beginning of a Japanese invasion of Rehe. However, it has been heard for weeks that the Japanese have been preparing to invade Rehe. The Tianjin Japanese News Agency, representing the views of the Japanese army, has been particularly active in spreading propaganda. Public opinion in Peiping generally believes that a large-scale conflict will not occur before the investigation commission leaves China. However, what actions the Japanese military will take are truly unpredictable. The Japanese embassy believes that the claim that the Japanese army is invading Rehe is not credible. (19th Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Rumors Abound in Peiping <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) The people of Peiping are greatly alarmed today due to rumors of new developments in Rehe. Rumors are rampant. Chinese newspapers claim that the Japanese side is using a feint, spreading rumors that the Japanese army will advance towards Shanhaiguan, Tianjin, Peiping, and other places. At the same time, four companies of Japanese soldiers are reported to have arrived in Yixian, Rehe. Another rumor claims that the Japanese side has presented Tang Yulin with five demands, including recognition of (Manchukuo) and permission for the Japanese army to be stationed in Rehe. Although the Japanese embassy has firmly denied these rumors, passersby believe that the rumors must have some basis. The people of Peiping are convinced that the Japanese will take action in Rehe. Tang Yulin is currently consulting closely with Zhang Xueliang regarding defense matters. (20th Reuters)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The government is paying close attention to the developments in Rehe. It has telegraphed Hankou today, urging Military Committee Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to return to Nanjing to deal with everything. It is generally believed that Chiang Kai-shek will return here by plane in the next few days. Senior military officers held a meeting this afternoon and another meeting at night. The nature of their discussions has not been revealed. (20th Reuters)</p>

At the same time, he telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek to report on the situation. (20th Dispatch)</p>

However, the need for determination is only just beginning. The true test of the spirit, strength, and ability of the Investigation Commission will not be in the (Manchukuo) pseudo-state, but what the Investigation Commission should pay attention to is something even more terrifying.

<p>And Abandons the Request to Hire Foreign Lawyers</p>
<p>The Judicial Community Predicts That Noulens' Crime Can Hopefully Be Reduced</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Noulens couple's application for a transfer of jurisdiction has been rejected by the High Court. The ruling has been delivered to the defendants. It is heard that the Noulens couple have recently accepted the persuasion of Soong Ching-ling and others, expressing their willingness to be tried in Nanjing. The issue of foreign lawyers is also willing to be dismissed, and it is planned to hire two Chinese lawyers with a good reputation in Shanghai to serve as defense counsel at the trial. The trial will now continue in the Jiangning Court by the Supreme Court after the Noulens couple recover. According to predictions in the judicial community, according to the documents seized from the Noulens couple by the government, they are (representatives of the Eastern Department of the Third International). According to China's current Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic, their violation of the criminal law is undeniable, and there are also plots in the documents to subvert the Chinese government, which is even more important. However, if the investigation reveals that the attempted plan is still in the planning stage, it may be possible to avoid the death penalty and obtain a life imprisonment sentence. According to the amnesty decree promulgated by the National Government, if the Noulens couple's conspiracy does not have a (completed fact) situation, they should be granted amnesty, and the sentence should be reduced by about one-third, which is a prison sentence of between ten and sixteen years. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Judicial Administration stated that the Shanghai English-language newspaper, the *Times*, recently published a self-report by Noulens on the situation and treatment of his detention in the Shanghai District Court, the Military Law Division of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Jiangning Detention Center, which is completely inconsistent with the facts and contains many slanders. Special commissioners were sent to the Military Law Division and the Jiangning Detention Center to investigate the living conditions of the Noulens couple in Shanghai, and photographs were taken of the prison's dormitory, dining room, and daily resting place, which will be sent to the newspaper for factual correction. According to news from the court, Noulens' transcript was taken out when the Peis and others visited the detention center. According to court regulations, visitors to prisoners must be inspected by the detention center when entering and leaving. The Noulens case was originally given extra preferential treatment, and these visitors privately took out items that violated the court's rules, which damaged their moral obligations.

<p>Chiang Orders Military Department to Allocate Funds to Reward Xu Tingyao's Troops</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the recapture of Huoqiu, Chiang telegraphed from Hankou to the Ministry of Military Administration, ordering the allocation of 10,000 yuan to reward Xu Tingyao's division to encourage them. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A military doctor from the bandit suppression army in Huoqiu came to talk about the fierce fighting in the Huoqiu area in recent days, with casualties on both sides. Several hundred Communist bandits have been captured in the past few days, most of whom are civilians who were threatened and coerced within the Communist bandit's sphere of influence. The majority of the Communist bandits are local bandits and vagrants who have not undergone regular training, so their resistance is very weak and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. However, there is concern that the bandit party may be disguised as farmers, making it difficult for officials to identify them at once. Xu Tingyao is paying close attention to this and is using a combination of suppression and appeasement methods, and is cooperating with the local people to clear out the bandits. In this way, it will be easier to eliminate them, and it is hoped that a fundamental solution can be achieved, so that there will be no more worries about the bandits returning after the army leaves.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Dalian Customs issue, there is a rumor that the National Government will adopt double taxation as retaliation, which has aroused deep concern from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the authorities, double taxation is nothing more than the following three methods: (1) Abolishing the transit tax on goods that dock along the Chinese coast and unload in Dalian, and instead levying import duties in Shanghai and other places. (2) Maintaining the transit tax but levying high rates on transit goods. (3) In addition to the Dalian export tax, imposing an import tax in Shanghai on goods exported from Manchuria. However, all three of these violate the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce, and if the Chinese side actually implements them, a serious protest will be lodged.

It may be slightly difficult to fill the gap during the transition period, but for the sake of the country's permanent finances, it must be resolutely implemented. The silver and money industry in this city believes that because the national currency system has not yet been unified and there are no restrictions on the right to mint and issue currency, they fear that abolishing the tael will lead to speculation and manipulation of hard currency, and they believe that the Shanghai merchants' claims are very true.

Therefore, it is reiterated that from the beginning of the 21st academic year, students of all schools must not wear military uniforms again. If they deliberately violate this regulation, the local police are allowed to immediately hand them over to the school for strict punishment. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e78">Saito Cabinet's Days May Be Numbered <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Suspicions and Infighting Between the Two Political Parties Increase Fascist Influence</p>
<p>Cabinet Reshuffle Expected No Later Than August</p>
<p>Movement to Support Ugaki Gradually Gaining Strength</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 17th, according to a Reuters reporter's observation, the position of the Saito Cabinet is precarious, and Saito's personal situation is also extremely difficult. If Saito were purely the leader of a one-party cabinet, it would not be easy to mediate between the factions within the party. Now, the so-called national government is composed of two opposing parties. The opinions of the two parties are fundamentally different. Although they say they are cooperating, they do not slightly change their inherent attitude of mutual suspicion and infighting. In the past, the prime minister only sought to lead one party. Saito's position requires him to reconcile the two parties, and it is easy to imagine that his work is twice as difficult. Therefore, since Saito took office, no matter what he does, he must take the reconciliation of the two parties as a prerequisite. When he formed the cabinet, the two parties had a dispute that almost caused the cabinet formation to fail. Since then, conflicts have been heard from time to time, and the prime minister has been mediating and buffering, so he cannot concentrate on important issues such as national finance, economy, diplomacy, and society. At present, there is a major dispute between the two parties that has not yet been resolved, namely, the selection of a successor to the president of the South Manchuria Railway after Uchida Kosai was transferred to fill the post of foreign minister. The government has decided that Kajihara will succeed him, but the Seiyukai and the military have suddenly risen up in opposition. The Seiyukai believes that Kajihara was nominated by the Minseito, and the military says that Kajihara has little relationship with the army. Interior Minister Nagai believes that the power to appoint the president of the South Manchuria Railway is within his jurisdiction and is extremely resentful of outside interference. If the government withdraws its order and appoints someone else, Nagai may resign. But if Nagai resigns, it will cause a problem for the entire cabinet. Therefore, to ease the situation, the issue of the president of the South Manchuria Railway is temporarily shelved, and the prime minister alone will resolve it after the tempers of the parties involved have calmed down. What is most noteworthy is that if the two parties continue to fight like this, they will only increase the momentum of those who oppose the party system. The call for a reorganized government will soon be discovered. But if Saito disregards the differences between the two parties, then a reorganized government is also inevitable. The party system cannot be revived, and a coalition government cannot be implemented. The future is bleak and difficult to predict. No wonder the nationalist parties with a general fascist color are extremely interested in the current situation.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Manchoho said that the Saito Cabinet, which promotes national unity, has failed to establish a fundamental national policy to save the country since its formation, and the lives of the people are getting poorer and poorer, and the people are full of resentment. Therefore, although it is nominally a national unity, it is actually a traditional old habit, which has gradually disappointed the people. Therefore, in order to clean up the current difficult situation, a strong cabinet must appear, and a major plan for the country's century-old plan must be established. At present, the voice of cabinet reorganization has risen again. Many people believe that the successor cabinet will be none other than the Seiyukai's Suzuki, the Minseito's Wakatsuki, or a coalition cabinet such as Hiranuma and Kuhara, but the political parties are all afraid of the military, so they do not dare to carry out political activities openly, but only secretly. It is estimated that the life of the Saito Cabinet will end around mid-August. At present, all parties are preparing to act, such as sending peasant agitators to the provinces and buying a large newspaper in the city to agitate for the overthrow of the cabinet.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun said that since Ugaki, the Governor-General of Korea, entered Tokyo, the political circles have suddenly launched a campaign to support Ugaki and establish a new party. Now, under the leadership of Mr. Laemholz, they will work hard with Kenzo Adachi, Riichi Yamamichi, and Kojiro Tomita to get Ugaki to come forward. If a new party is established, the successor cabinet may fall into the hands of the Ugaki faction. It is also unknown.</p>

<p>The China United News Agency telegraphed from Tokyo on the 20th that the Kwantung Army Special Service Department in Shenyang convened a four-party meeting of South Manchuria Railway representatives, the Kwantung Agency, and consuls to discuss the migration site of the Japanese rural army. After weeks of consultation, the location decided upon is as follows: (1) The Jilin Province area is the first pre-selected site, especially the area within ten miles along the Yanji-Jilin Railway is the most beautiful site. (2) The Mudanjiang River Basin. (3) The Songhua River Basin and the Second Songhua River Basin. (4) The South Manchuria Railway's Shangxian area has places to cultivate paddy fields. The Japanese military has chosen the Jilin Province border with Russia as the immigration site for the rural army. Its purpose is to fight against Soviet Russia. The South Manchuria Railway and the Kwantung Agency are all following the military's orders. The policy has been decided. Once the mobilization order for the rural army is issued, the Japanese army will come to Jilin one after another.</p>

<p>The China United News Agency telegraphed from Tokyo on the 20th that the Japanese military held a meeting of the three chiefs at 2:00 p.m. today. Chief of Staff Masaki, Director General of Education Hayashi, and Army Minister Araki were present. First, Araki reported on the countermeasures for the unified political plan of the four Mongolians and the successor issue of the president of the South Manchuria Railway. Masaki then reported on the situation of the Japanese army entering Rehe and the content of Tang Yulin's military conference, saying that the generals were divided into two factions, one for the Zhang aid faction and one for the Zhang anti-faction. The discussion was unresolved, and the Japanese army decided to take the original planned plan. The China United News Agency telegraphed from Tokyo on the 20th that the Japanese military wants to scientifically invade and annex our Northeast. The military has hired scholars and experts in engineering, mining, geology, agriculture, and chemistry to go to the Northeast to organize a large investigation agency under the command of the commander of the Kwantung Army. Under the orders of the military, they will study, investigate, and formulate concrete invasion methods. The ambition of the Japanese warlords is growing more and more fierce.</p>

<p>Baben Concurrently Serves as Executive Committee Member</p>
<p>All Acting Cabinet Members Dismissed</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party's Wish Has Been Fulfilled</p>
<p>Reuters telegraphed from Berlin on the 20th that Prussia has announced an actual dictatorship due to the political deadlock. Premier Baben has been appointed as a state commissioner, with Mayor of Eisen, Dr. Bahrach, as his deputy. They will govern Prussia with powers almost equal to those of a dictator. After taking office, Baben's first move was to announce martial law in Prussia. Baben used the central government's decision to build an actual dictatorship in Prussia and announced it to the public at the Prussian acting cabinet meeting this morning. He said that he was the premier of the central government and could not guarantee the security of the turbulent area in Prussia. Now Dr. Bahrach is his representative to govern Pubang with dictatorial power until the new parliament of Pubang ends the political deadlock and allows the election of a premier. Baben's move is in line with the wishes of the leaders of the National Socialist Party, such as Hitler, who have been arguing that Pubang is under the rule of the Socialist Party and can no longer curb the increasingly serious internal unrest. According to reports, Prussia has an area of ​​113,740 miles and a population of 37 million, making it the largest state in Germany. It continues, saying that all acting cabinet members of Pubang have been dismissed.</p>
<p>Reuters telegraphed from Berlin on the 20th that the central government's actions to deal with the Prussian authorities are nothing less than a rash political strategy. Today, the Prussian State Council on Wilhelm Street has been occupied by the army. Defense Minister General Schleicher has been appointed as the governor of Berlin (the capital of Prussia) and Brandenburg Province, and will exercise administrative power in these two places. The chief and deputy chief of the Berlin police have resigned. President Hindenburg today ordered the cancellation of certain articles of the constitution and authorized General Schleicher to implement censorship on newspapers, letters, and telephones, and to search residences and confiscate everything. The order also allows the establishment of special courts to try those who violate military orders. Those who resist with weapons, plot wrongdoing, damage railways, and use bombs may be sentenced to death.</p>

<p>Treaty of Friendship Concluded with Turkey</p>
<p>Nominally to Protect Peace in the Near East</p>
<p>In Fact, Opening the Door to the East</p>
<p>Rome News Since Mussolini took office in Italy, his political vision has always been focused on the East, with "Eastward Advance" as its political slogan. He once said that Italy's future lies in the East, not in the West. It has adopted a friendly policy towards Turkey. Recently, the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister visited Rome and were warmly welcomed and given preferential treatment by the Pope and Mussolini. Its important significance is: (1) The revision of the Italy-Turkey Treaty of Friendship; (2) The establishment of a commercial cooperation plan between the two countries; (3) The establishment of commercial ties between Italy, Turkey, and Russia based on the Italy-Turkey, Turkey-Russia, and Italy-Russia treaties; (4) The commitment of Italy to the peaceful advancement of Islamic countries such as Syria, Iraq, and Palestine. The conclusion of the Italy-Turkey treaty is nominally to protect peace in the Near East on the Italian side, but its true purpose is to expand its power in the Mediterranean and open the door to the (Eastward Advance) that it has long desired. As for Turkey, it urgently needs to recover from the economic and political difficulties after the war, and it is also happy to use the conclusion of this treaty to seek temporary peace.

<p>Lausanne Conference Demands Not Met</p>
<p>Foreign Minister and Finance Minister Resign Simultaneously</p>
<p>Prime Minister Concurrently Holds the Post of Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Reuter, Rome, 20th - A surprising event occurred in Rome today. Five members of Mussolini's cabinet suddenly resigned simultaneously. Those who resigned were Foreign Minister Grandi, Finance Minister Mosconi, Education Minister Giuliano, Minister of Corporations Bottai, and Minister of Justice Rocco. After the five members resigned, Mussolini immediately announced that he would concurrently hold the posts of Foreign Minister and Minister of Corporations. It is noted that the post of Minister of Interior is also currently held by Mussolini. According to an explanation by the authorities, the reason for the resignation of the five members is said to be part of Mussolini's plan to reorganize the government at a certain time, so that other members may have the opportunity to display their political talents. However, it is generally believed that the resignation of the five members was due to Mussolini's dissatisfaction with Foreign Minister Grandi and Finance Minister Mosconi for failing to achieve a complete write-off of reparations and war debts at the recent Lausanne Conference. It is hoped that Grandi, after his resignation, will be appointed as the Italian Ambassador to London, as this position has been vacant for a long time since the death of Bodonaro two months ago. After the resignation of the five members, the government immediately ordered government management of stock exchange transactions, so the people's hearts were not greatly shaken.</p>

<p>Presumably Related to War Debt Issues</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 19th - It was officially announced tonight that US Ambassador Mellon will return to the United States tomorrow. It is speculated here that Ambassador Mellon may discuss war debt issues with President Hoover after returning to the United States. The official statement is that Ambassador Mellon's return to the United States has no political mission and is only to attend to his personal business. However, observers say that his return coincides with the aftermath of the Lausanne Conference, suggesting a possible connection. Some speculate that Hoover wants to understand the situation in Europe in detail, so he has requested Mellon to return to the United States. In any case, it is unlikely that Mellon's return to Washington will not involve discussions of war debts and the overall situation in Europe.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 19th - The Spanish government, due to the invention by chemist Bodel of extracting pure gold from mercury, has specifically organized a committee of experts from the Ministry of Finance to investigate the truth of the matter. All sectors outside are deeply convinced that the gold extraction experiment has been successful, but the report of the expert committee has not yet been published. The inventor, Bodel, claims that after mercury undergoes chemical action, it loses its original sulfur substance, while its pure gold substance remains unchanged, with a composition of about half of the original mercury. Currently, public opinion in Spain is feeling very excited about this matter, as Spain is the world's richest country in mercury production. If the experiment of extracting pure gold from mercury is successful, it will greatly benefit the country's economic position.</p>

<p>New Planet Closest to Earth</p>
<p>Orbit Between Earth and Venus</p>
<p>Heidelberg (Germany) - The Heidelberg Observatory recently reported the discovery of a new planet. Its closest distance to Earth is only 7 million kilometers (approximately 4.35 million miles). The discoverer is Dr. Carl Reinmuth. The planet's orbit is circular, located between the orbits of Earth and Venus. According to Ganinham of the Harvard Observatory, the planet's orbit is extremely peculiar. This planet, which is closer to the sun than Earth, is the first discovery of its kind. The planet is sometimes only 4,000,000 miles from Earth, and on May 16th of this year, it was 7,000,000 miles from Earth. This planet is an important discovery in astronomy. (World News Agency)</p>

<p>Jehol Under Strain... Tang Yulin's Involvement is Significant</p>
<p>Yu Pass on the Brink... He Zhuguo's Lone Stand</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Exhausted... Eagerly Awaiting Assistance from All Sides</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence - The iron hooves of the Japanese army have already trampled all over the three eastern provinces. Eight customs checkpoints have been occupied and are now separated from the Nanjing General Customs Administration. The postal services of the three provinces are also scheduled to become independent on August 1st. The territory and sovereignty of the three provinces under the rule of the Republic of China are lost, completely lost! However, the Japanese have not yet fully satisfied their desires in losing the three eastern provinces. For nearly twenty years, they have been advocating a unified policy for Manchuria and Mongolia, and they are now carrying it out. Jehol, Beiping, Tianjin, and Chahar are all within their plan of gradual encroachment. They must acquire Jehol, Chahar, Beiping, and Tianjin before they can unite with Mongolia. Recently, the Japanese army has gradually concentrated in Yixian, and the police in Shanhaiguan frequently report alarms. Tang Yulin's attitude is particularly noteworthy. Tang has two representatives, one stationed in Shenyang and one in Changchun. Tang's property in Shenyang has suffered no losses, and Tang's name was also listed at the beginning of the puppet state's organization. Tang has not made any firm statements of rejection. Although Tang has stated that his difficult position forces him to feign compliance with the Japanese, if the Japanese army advances towards Jehol, then Tang must firmly express his attitude and can no longer be ambiguous. Whether he resolutely rises up to resist or follows in the footsteps of the Northeast Army by making an unresisting retreat is of great importance. His attitude is truly worthy of attention. He Zhuguo is indeed a hero. He wants to splatter the first pass under heaven, Yu Pass, with his hot blood, but unfortunately, the situation is no longer favorable for a lone stand. As long as the Japanese army advances on Yu Pass, it will eventually be difficult to defend because Zhang Xueliang has not paid attention to Yu Pass and made arrangements for a last-ditch defense.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the Northeast, fearing the pain of national and family destruction, have seen volunteer armies spring up everywhere, giving the Japanese army considerable punishment. If someone were to lead them, there would indeed be great prospects. The volunteer army's original intention of taking up arms to defend against the enemy clearly knew that their strength was limited and could not last, but they truly hoped that those responsible within the passes and the people of all provinces would provide tangible assistance. Unexpectedly, the months of January, February, March, April, May, and June have flown by like an arrow, and assistance has never materialized, causing those who sacrificed their lives for the country to be exposed in the sand without anyone caring, and those who were injured for the country to groan in the wilderness without anyone treating them. During the Battle of Shanghai, donations from various places to comfort the 19th Route Army were numerous, but there was very little comfort for the volunteer army outside the passes, causing the patriotic heroes to go from hope to disappointment and discouragement. Those who later raised the banner of the volunteer army,</p>
<p>A portion are bandits. Among the bandits, there are bound to be those who falsely use the name of volunteer armies to disturb the local area and hope for future recruitment. The Japanese are keenly aware of this situation and have recently formulated a plan to cut off the water at the source. Soon, they will start to appease the bandits and incorporate them into the puppet Manchukuo's national defense forces. These people are forced by hunger and cold, and we cannot blame them for surrendering to the enemy. The Japanese plan is to wait until all the appeasement is completed, then send Japanese officers to carry out military training, using various methods to numb their conscience, hoping to complete the training in three months. Then, they will drive them into the passes to have Chinese fight Chinese. If they win, they will open up territory for the puppet state; if they lose, the Japanese army will cut off their return route, and they will all die within the passes. Their plan is truly poisonous. As for the Black Army and the Self-Defense Forces, composed of local militias, led by Ma Zhanshan, Ding Chao, Li Du, etc., near the Middle East Railway, they are still fighting hard, but I am afraid that the day of exhaustion, depleted ammunition, and depleted food is not far off.</p>
<p>The magistrates and public security chiefs of the counties under the jurisdiction of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang are mostly the same people as before the September 18th Incident. However, the county government dispatches one Japanese person to serve as an instructor, who controls everything and plays with the county magistrate at will. Among the county magistrates of the three provinces, there are many intelligent and patriotic individuals. After the incident, they could have brought their seals into the passes, but most of them valued their responsibility to defend the territory and dared not leave without authorization. They also hoped to recover the lost territory in a short period of time. Later, they realized that their hopes had become illusions and were controlled by the Japanese (instructors), becoming virtual prisoners from the beginning. Even if they wanted to break free, it was no longer possible. From the top of the puppet Manchukuo government down to the bureau chiefs and county magistrates, all have become puppets, manipulated by the Japanese. As for the people, they are eking out a living under the iron hooves. Whenever the Japanese encounter our compatriots, they ask, "What country are you from?" They must answer, "Manchukuo." Then they ask, "Is China good, or is Manchukuo good?" They must answer, "Manchukuo is good." If they answer that they are Chinese and that China is good, they will be beaten severely, even to death. Their lives are truly like mayflies. What is most concerning is that the general education of children has also been completely Japanized, numbing their minds and obliterating their conscience. When they grow up, they will only know Manchuria and Japan and will no longer know the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Zhaiqing has recently been in Beijing and Shanghai, encouraging the people to use force to recover the Northeast in order to fulfill their responsibility as citizens. We express our utmost sympathy. At present, the volunteer army, self-defense forces, national salvation army, and the armies of Ma Zhanshan, Ding Chao, and Li Du in the Northeast are about to be exhausted, but as long as there is supply and leadership, taking advantage of the time when the green gauze is rising, it is the best opportunity to recover the Northeast. We sincerely hope that Mr. Zhu can raise ammunition and military pay and save the 30 million people of the Northeast as soon as possible, and should not delay any longer. Because the Japanese's fundamental method for eliminating hidden dangers for the puppet Manchukuo, the first step is to incorporate the volunteer army, and the second step is to wait until the end of autumn to implement the clearing of the countryside under the pretext of winter defense. All civilian self-defense firearms must be reported and stamped; otherwise, if they are found, they will be charged with concealing military equipment and communicating with bandits. After the firearms owned by the people of the three provinces have been surveyed, the people will be ordered to carry their weapons to the nearest managing agency to request registration, inspection, and branding. The various rural clearing agencies will take this opportunity to confiscate the firearms. From then on, the 30 million people of the Northeast will become meat on the chopping block, to be slaughtered by foreign races.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also an event that is part of the Japanese conspiracy to occupy the three eastern provinces. In 1930, the "Manzhou Daily" published the "Biographies of Northeast Figures," extensively advertising in the newspaper to solicit information about the deeds, properties, and addresses of Northeast figures, seeking as much detail as possible. Excluding first-class figures who were well-known to the Japanese and did not need to be solicited, roles of the second and third class or lower would either submit articles themselves or hire someone to write them. They would exaggerate their own deeds and faithfully write about their properties to show their wealth. It is said that the newspaper spent no less than 200,000 yuan on soliciting articles, printing, and other expenses. Over 4,000 people were listed in the "Biographies of Northeast Figures," a truly impressive sight. Recently, if the puppet Manchukuo wants to confiscate the properties of Northeast figures, it does not need to conduct investigations; it can simply browse through the "Biographies of Northeast Figures" and find them according to the map without missing a single one. However, the implementation of this matter is still under consideration because the properties of many important people are insured by various powerful countries. If they are confiscated rashly, it will inevitably lead to many negotiations. However, this is only a matter of time. With the cunning of the Japanese, they will eventually find a way to deal with it. (July 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Deterioration Between Japan and Russia <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Police Arriving in Manchuria Opposed by Russia</p>
<p>Russia Sends Red Army to Increase Stationing on the Border to Demonstrate</p>
<p>The Incident at the Jiangbin Wharf Has Become Serious</p>
<p>Manzhouli Correspondence - In the past week, the relationship between Japan and Russia has become increasingly tense. Soviet Russia has also changed from being weak and soft to being strong and tough.</p>
<p>One hundred and sixty Japanese international police officers arrived in Manzhouli a month ago. Initially, they planned to begin service immediately, but the Soviet Russian consul raised questions, saying that Manzhouli belongs to the Sino-Russian border area. If the Japanese police came here to protect overseas Chinese, then they should not have local police power. Soviet Russia also has a number of overseas Chinese here. If Japan publicly implements police administration, Soviet Russia should also allocate Red Army troops to come to cooperate. Therefore, the Japanese side did not dare to serve as police officers in the city. This is a past matter. On the 12th of this month, the Red Army on the Soviet Russian border suddenly increased by many. More than 3,000 infantry and artillery troops were moved over to the No. 86 border station, approaching Manzhouli. On the morning of the 13th, more than 80 artillery shells were fired at both Datori and Abagaitu, and aircraft also soared into the air and circled before stopping in Manzhouli in the afternoon. Although the Japanese consul knew that the intention was to demonstrate, he did not dare to ask. Two Soviet Russian shallow-water warships outside Sanjiangkou sailed to and crossed Tongjiang to reach near Fujin a few days ago. Japanese aircraft urgently scouted, but the Russian warships were ingeniously equipped, with very little exposed above the water surface. Flying at low altitude was feared due to anti-aircraft artillery fire, so they ultimately failed to ascertain the situation and returned. In recent days, artillery fire and the sound of aircraft dropping bombs have been heard in Hulin, Xu Ergu, and Molihong, causing border residents to panic and move inland one after another. There are many Chinese soldiers along the border who have crossed the river to Soviet Russian territory or have been recruited to go there. There is a training center in both Bolik and Chita that specializes in training Chinese soldiers. Japanese spies reported to their military headquarters that they had confirmed that there were 1,700 people being trained in Bolik and 2,000 in Chita. They will be used against the Japanese army in Manchuria and as guides for the Red Army. A few days ago, a train arrived at the Hailin station on the Harbin-Suifenhe Railway, carrying 1,000 international communist soldiers. They planned to attack Shitouhezi, but they retreated because the Japanese army was prepared. This proves that the two incidents of Soviet Russia training communist soldiers in Bolik and Chita, which the Japanese side detected, are not fictitious. In Harbin, Soviet Russian important figures have recently been secretly returning to their country. Only the Consul General Shiratori and the Board Director Danilevsky and Deputy Board Director Kuznetszov remain. Because the manager of the Faya Bank, Mesherny, arrived in Harbin to discuss purchasing the Middle East Railway with the Japanese, he has been waiting in Harbin for many days. Now, on the 12th, he suddenly ordered his secretary to send his wife and children back to the country first, and he himself, accompanied by Deputy Consul Lasheman, took a train back to Moscow on the 13th. When passing through Manzhouli, he inspected the Manzhouli Customs. Because the Manzhouli branch of the customs is close to the Russian border and the Sino-Russian trade agreement has not been finalized, Soviet Russian goods are constantly arriving. China and Russia had signed a land tax collection agreement, and there are also Soviet Russian customs officials. The relationship with Soviet Russia is therefore extremely close. After the Northeast was forcibly occupied by Japan, Soviet Russia regarded it as a terminal point for pushing goods, which has been cut off, causing displeasure. This time, the Japanese side again made the puppet state forcibly collect taxes from various customs offices without consulting Russia before or after the fact, making Russia even more displeased. Previously, Soviet Russia was in a period of tolerance and did not ask about anything. Now, the attitude of Soviet Russia has changed to be strong. In this matter, they will not let go. If Kuznetszov's inspection reveals any unfavorable aspects to Soviet Russia, it may lead to a serious situation. It is also heard that Mr. Ku returned to the country to report on the situation within Manchuria, saying that Soviet Russia recalled various important figures to express its determination to Japan. This can be seen from the fact that the puppet state forcibly took over the Jiangbin Middle East Railway cargo warehouse, which has become a major issue. The Middle East Railway originally leased a section of land at Jiangbin Station from the Jiangyun Office to build the Jiangbin Wharf and Commercial Agency, with the aim of facilitating water and land transportation. It has been leasing for many years, and the contract has been renewed every year, with the rent being 15,000 rubles. This year, the puppet state, created by Japan, refused to renew the contract and did not pay the rent. Therefore, Japan manipulated the puppet Jiangyun Office to forcibly take it back and operate it themselves on the 8th, citing the non-performance of the contract and the non-payment of rent as reasons. After this incident occurred, Japan thought that Soviet Russia has always been weak and that it would likely have no recourse. Who knew that the Russian side would completely change its past demeanor? In addition to the Middle East Railway Board Director requesting the puppet governor to convene a meeting to resolve the matter, at the same time, Consul General Shiratori also lodged a serious protest and visited the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs twice to question the Japanese, Sugihara, the director of the puppet General Affairs Office. On the 11th, he also sent a strongly worded written</p>

<p>protest, saying that the Middle East Railway property belongs to Imperial Russia. Soviet Russia inherited the rights of the Middle East Railway based on the Sino-Russian and Fengtian-Russian agreements. Everything of the Middle East Railway belongs to Russia. Although China and Russia are nominally co-managed, it is only a nominal distinction. Whether the Manchukuo has the right to enjoy the Middle East Railway business on behalf of China is still in question. The Jiangbin Wharf is Middle East Railway land, and its internal land cannot be taken over. Sugihara, because the case was important, went to Changchun to meet the puppet Vice Minister, the Japanese Ohashi Tadashi, and returned to Harbin on the 13th. He immediately replied to the Russian Consul in writing and sent it over, but it was returned. At the same time, the Russian Consulate announced to the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telephone that Russia and Manchuria would cease all direct negotiations from now on. On the 12th, the Russian directors of the Middle East Railway Board of Directors again requested a meeting to discuss the matter. The puppet director</p>
<p>Because he had not received orders from the Japanese side, he did not dare to attend. The Russian Bureau Director then issued a hand-written order to the Business Office without waiting for a resolution, sending personnel to set up a wharf office in the third warehouse of the Jiangbin Wharf and start new operations. The Russian Deputy Board Director returned to the country on the 13th, which is said to be related to this matter. This is truly unexpected to the Japanese. The relationship between Japan and Russia has reached a state of deterioration. A conflict between Japan and Russia may be an intended event. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Heilongjiang Volunteer Army Greatly Defeats Japanese Army <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Killed More Than 400 Japanese Soldiers in Gaolingzi</p>
<p>Inflicted Numerous Deaths and Injuries on Japanese Soldiers in Laha City</p>
<p>Hailun Correspondence - On July 12th, the National Salvation Army under Wang Delin captured Daohezi, a station on the Harbin-Suifenhe Railway. The Japanese army had dispatched a large force from Mianpo to counterattack. It is reported that at 5 p.m. that afternoon, the Japanese army under the Itaya Brigade, totaling approximately 3,000 troops, boarded a train and headed towards Yinma River. However, upon reaching Gaolingzi, because the mountain terrain was treacherous and the railway track was built on the ridge, the vehicles had to pass through a winding path, making the journey very tortuous. The National Salvation Army had 미리 prepared three freight cars at the highest winding path and dismantled the winding path at the foot of the mountain. When the Japanese train approached and was blocked at the foot of the mountain, the National Salvation Army dismantled the track on the side of the mountain peak, causing the three freight cars to roll down the mountain slope and fall to the foot of the mountain, directly smashing into the Japanese train. Seven of the cars were immediately pulverized, and the remaining cars also overturned beside the railway track. Gunpowder inside a railway car</p>
<p>Was detonated, creating a huge explosion. Approximately 400 soldiers and officers were reduced to powder, and countless pieces of equipment and wheels were damaged. There were also many light and serious injuries. By the morning of the 13th, the Japanese army from Mianpo had arrived to provide assistance and transported the wounded and dead back to Hengdaohezi. The area east of Hengdaohezi was then in the hands of the National Salvation Army. The news of this event spread to various places, and everyone who heard it was overjoyed. On the same day this event occurred, a fierce battle also broke out on the banks of the Nen River in Heilongjiang. The Heilongjiang army under Xu Zihe and Xu Baozhen killed hundreds of Japanese soldiers. The cause was that the Japanese army in Nehe had pressured the Heilongjiang army under Xu Baozhen to withdraw from the city on the 10th. Afterwards, the Japanese armies in Nehe, Laha, and Nenjiang, totaling more than 5,000 troops, had formed a line to block the Heilongjiang army's path to attack Heilongjiang. The Japanese army guarding Nehe was the Koizumi Regiment, consisting of 2,500 infantry and 500 artillery. The Japanese army guarding Nenjiang was the Owari River Cavalry Regiment, consisting of approximately 1,700 troops. The Japanese army guarding Laha Station was the Toiya Infantry Company, along with artillery and cavalry, totaling 500 troops. On the 10th, the Japanese army was digging trenches at these three locations, planning to build deep ditches and high fortifications to trap the Heilongjiang army. Also, the main force of the Hiramatsu Brigade launched an attack on the volunteer army led by Cai Hongyou in Keshan, so they did not pressure the Heilongjiang army near Nenjiang. On the 12th, the armies of Xu Baozhen and Xu Zihe launched a siege on Laha Station, the central point of the Japanese army on the banks of the Nen River, and divided their forces to defend against the reinforcements of the Owari River and Koizumi near the banks of the Nen River and Nehe. At 8 p.m. that afternoon, when it was dark and the Japanese aircraft could not take off, they took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. The Japanese army was besieged in Laha City, and could not escape left or right. More than 100 Japanese residents also joined the battle, but the Heilongjiang army was exceptionally brave. Knowing that the Japanese army's aim was inaccurate in the dark, they used a strong force to charge forward and shout, chasing and killing the Japanese soldiers who had no way to escape. At approximately 2 a.m. on the morning of the 13th, the company commander Toiya and the infantry lieutenant Murano, along with four other officers, were killed by the broadsword team. Countless Japanese soldiers were killed by artillery fire and broadswords. The remaining forces protected the Japanese residents and retreated towards the Qiqihar Road, which is the same road. The Heilongjiang army entered Laha City at 3 a.m. on the 13th. This place is a dangerous strategic point in northeastern Heilongjiang and also an important road to attack the provincial capital from northern Heilongjiang. After entering the city, the Heilongjiang army stationed troops inside and outside to guard it. During the fierce battle, a Japanese resident of Laha, Takai, escaped to the Ningnian station on the Qiqihar Road and telegraphed Nenjiang and Nehe for help. The Owari River Cavalry mobilized all their troops to rescue them, but upon reaching the banks of the Nen River, there was no bridge to cross due to the late hour, and it had also been burned by the Heilongjiang army. They then traveled quickly along the river, but were intercepted by the Heilongjiang army. Countless people drowned in the water. The remaining forces retreated to the Ningnian station. The Heilongjiang army immediately surrounded them outside the station. They were still in confrontation on the 13th. The Japanese army had lost their supplies for a day and night and were on the verge of being resolved by the Heilongjiang army. After the Koizumi Infantry received the emergency report from Laha, they rushed to the vicinity of Laha at 11 a.m. on the 13th, but were again fiercely attacked head-on by the Heilongjiang army and returned to Nehe to defend themselves. Upon receiving the report of the crisis in Laha, four Japanese aircraft flew to Laha and dropped more than ten bombs, but were repelled by the Heilongjiang army's artillery fire. According to the reconnaissance report from the aircraft, the Heilongjiang army, numbering approximately 7,000 to 8,000, had dug trenches on the left bank of the Nen River to defend and intended to stay there for a long time. The Japanese army stationed in Heilongjiang had already advanced in that direction, and a brigade of the Japanese army stationed in Harbin also departed in that direction on the 13th. There will likely be a fierce battle in that area. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Discussing the Current Situation in Rehe with Tan Guohuan <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Tang Yulin Determined to Defend Territory</p>
<p>Mongolian Bandits Disturbing Rehe Have Been Cleared</p>
<p>A recent dispatch from Beiping regarding the Rehe issue has varied reports. To clarify the current situation in Rehe, this reporter specifically visited Tan Guohuan, Secretary-General of the Rehe Provincial Government, to inquire about the military and administrative conditions in various parts of the province. Mr. Tan made the following statement:</p>
<p>(Since the September 18th Incident, Premier Tang (Yulin) of Rehe Province has recognized the extreme importance of the province's defense due to its proximity to the Northeast. He has therefore resolved to protect the land and ensure the people's safety, aligning himself with the central government's intentions. Regarding the Japanese residents within Rehe Province, fearing incidents, special troops were dispatched to provide strict protection at all times. In Chifeng, where a Japanese consulate was located, the Japanese Consul, Mr. Muta, consulted with the provincial government, and it was decided that all Japanese residents in Rehe would withdraw uniformly. The Japanese consul also reported the number of departing Japanese residents to the provincial government in detail. Chairman Tang dispatched guards to escort the Japanese residents out of the province, ensuring that all Japanese residents arrived safely in Beiping. Mr. Yano Makoto, acting charge d'affaires of the Japanese legation in Beiping, personally sent a letter to the Rehe Provincial Government expressing his gratitude for Rehe's protection of Japanese residents. At that time, the Rehe Provincial Government reported the entire situation to the central government and Director Zhang. After the Japanese residents left Rehe, the local area remained peaceful. Recently, Japan has been using Mongolian cavalry and bandits to create disturbances in Chaoyang East, Kailu, and Lingyuan. The eastern part of Chaoyang is mostly high mountains and valleys. When the Mongolian bandits caused disturbances, Rehe Province sent troops to attack, and fortunately, the Mongolian bandits were cleared within less than half a month. Although there have been various rumors about the recent situation in Rehe, Chief Secretary Tang (Zuo Fu) recently came to Beiping from Chengde, and the Chaoyang East incident was resolved long ago. The provincial government first sent Zhang Bingyi, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, to inspect and investigate the local situation in detail. After Director Zhang returned to the province, based on his report, Chairman Tang immediately dismissed all corrupt officials and reassigned Li Zhizhen as the magistrate of Chaoyang County and Zhang Lin as the commander of the local militia. Magistrate Li has a very harmonious relationship with the people. The county has a long-standing reputation for being difficult to govern, which proves that maintaining local security is not easy. The Yixian area on the border of Rehe is very close to Beizhen and Jinxi. The dangerous locations such as Hongluoxian, Da Yaogou, Nuan Ditang, and the mountainous areas of Kailu and Lingyuan in Rehe have natural barriers that are difficult to penetrate, and the small mountain paths are rugged and large vehicles cannot travel side by side, making transportation difficult. Other locations such as Lengkou and Xifengkou are also natural fortifications. Chairman Tang previously sent his second son to Beiping, and he has already reported to Director Zhang. Director Zhang and Chairman Tang are still exchanging telegrams, which proves that the rumors are not true. According to recent reports, there are four regiments of Japanese troops stationed in Yixian, coveting the situation in Rehe. According to reliable reports from Rehe yesterday, there have recently been refugees from Yixian arriving in Rehe. According to the refugees, the number of Japanese troops in Yixian is very small, with forty of them residing in the home of Director Li of the Rehe Construction Department, who is from Yixian. The Japanese troops in Yixian came from Beipiao. Although there have recently been Mongolian bandit activities, they have not significantly affected the security of Rehe. Although there are many doubts about Chairman Tang, such as the Gilin Daily publishing a copperplate map that includes Rehe as part of Manchuria and claiming that Tang has accepted various appointments, these actions are entirely for Japanese propaganda purposes. Although the Japanese have not forgotten their intentions towards Rehe, Chairman Tang, for the sake of the overall situation, is determined to defend the territory. Mr. Tai Bing-san (Xi-ling) personally visited Rehe in April this year to inspect the local situation, and he is very clear about the situation. Because I have been assigned to come to Beiping, the date of my return to Rehe is undetermined. Chief Secretary Tang went to Tianjin yesterday and will return to Chengde within a few days."

<p>Orders Military and Police Agencies to Strictly Enforce</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou: Commander-in-Chief Chiang has come to Hankou to supervise the troops and suppress bandits, vigorously rectifying the military and eliminating decadent customs. Yesterday, the 18th, Chiang issued an order to strictly investigate and ban opium dens and brothels, with a deadline of the 23rd to completely eliminate them. On the 19th, he also ordered the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters and the Hankou Public Security Bureau to strictly suppress prostitution and stipulate provisional regulations. Military and government personnel who solicit prostitutes or stay in brothels will be immediately arrested. The order stated:</p>

<p>Ministry of Education's Fulfillment of Prerequisites for Takeover</p>
<p>Faculty and Staff to Petition in Beijing En Masse</p>
<p>Yesterday, the fifth general meeting of the National Labor University Faculty and Staff School Protection Association was held. All faculty and staff, including Zhang Yuanzhe, Han Yanmen, and Li Ying, attended. Wang Cheng served as chairman, and Chen Zhen served as recorder. Two important resolutions were passed, as follows: (1) It was resolved to telegraph the Ministry of Education, welcoming the dispatch of personnel for takeover, but only after fulfilling two conditions: (1) Immediately formally announce the Labor University Revival Plan; (2) Fully pay all back wages. The original telegram text is recorded below: (To the esteemed Ministry of Education in Nanjing: We have heard that the Ministry is dispatching personnel to take over our school. Our colleagues have long awaited the handover with great joy. We hope that the back wages will be allocated at the same time to facilitate the closure. We also hope that the Ministry will consider the difficulty of establishing this school and the ardent expectations of the people of the whole country, and immediately announce the revival and reorganization plan to prevent this only labor education institution from being destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. Otherwise, we colleagues can only vow to fight to the end with our sincere school protection spirit. Respectfully, the National Labor University School Protection Committee.)</p>
<p>(2) It was resolved that faculty and staff will go to Beijing en masse within days to petition and demand back wages from the Ministry of Education, thereby urging the Ministry to pay attention to its duties and respect its responsibilities.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the "Ninety-Three Old Man," could not bear to see Labor University destroyed by artillery fire from Japan and then suspended by the Ministry of Education. He repeatedly wrote to important figures in the Beijing government, requesting that they withdraw the order. This was reported earlier. It has now been learned that the old man recently wrote to Cai Yuanpei, the founder of Labor University, asking him to write to the Ministry of Education in the name of the Academia Sinica, requesting that it revoke the order to close Labor University. His original letter is as follows: (To Mr. Zimin: I recently heard that you returned to Shanghai from giving lectures in Wuhan. I think of your virtuous efforts in founding the National Labor University. Now, the Ministry of Education's division chiefs have ordered its closure because the school cannot easily raise funds after the January 28th Incident. However, you once traveled to Europe. After the European war, all universities that were destroyed did their best to rebuild, both to awaken the national spirit of common hatred and to show that national planning prioritizes culture. This closure order is insufficient to show to foreign countries and the people of the country. Moreover, labor is the foundation of people's livelihood. What I have heard and seen makes me feel compelled to speak to you. Would it be possible to write to the National Government's Ministry of Education in the name of the Academia Sinica, requesting that it revoke the order to close Labor University, leaving a glimmer of hope for the people and comforting the teachers and students of the school who are reducing expenses, maintaining hardship, and earnestly serving the country? Poor and needy children will also be able to receive higher vocational education. I don't know if this is appropriate for your wisdom. [The rest omitted])</p>

<p>Famous figures from Shanghai's educational and industrial circles, including Mu Ouchu, Pan Xulun, Huang Renzhi, Zou Bingwen, and Yang Xixian, as well as Madam Huang Yingbai and Madam Shen Yiyun, believe that although Shanghai is known as a culturally developed area with many schools, there are few perfect and excellent elementary schools, especially in the concessions. Therefore, they are raising funds to establish an experimental elementary school. They strive for complete facilities in academic subjects, and the teaching methods must be perfect. In terms of children's life training and management, they have the most reasonable methods to correct the common problems of elementary schools today. The location is near the French Concession Park, and boarding will be provided. They have specially entrusted Yang Weiyu, the deputy director of the Chinese Vocational Education Society, and Yao Huiquan to prepare. Twenty years ago, Yang founded the attached elementary school of the Suzhou Women's Normal School. American Doctors Dewey and Meng assessed Chinese education and praised it as the best in the country. Yao founded the Municipal Feihong Elementary School, which is also well-known. They are now actively preparing and will soon officially announce enrollment.</p>

<p>A Precious Treasure for Young Students</p>
<p>A True Compass for Advancement and Entrance Examinations</p>
<p>The Qinfen Bookstore, located at No. M117, Huajinli Intersection, Four Horse Road, Shanghai, is responding to the current need for advancement and entrance examinations by issuing two major works: University Entrance Examination Guide and Middle School Entrance Examination Guide. The two series were compiled by 　Jieshao Ji, a famous educator with rich educational experience. Cai Jie Min wrote the title and praised them, saying that the collection is thorough and the description is clear, which can indeed be used as a guide for those who aspire to advance, and he is happy to introduce them. Each book is priced at six corners, and an additional postage fee is required for mail orders. The price is low and the quality is good, and the application is extremely large. The former book has a total of six chapters, and the latter book has a total of seven chapters. Each chapter is divided into sections, and according to the level and needs of universities and middle schools, everything about advancement, registration, entrance examinations, enrollment, course selection, and intellectual, physical, and economic conditions, as well as the current status of various universities and middle schools, is compiled in detail and provides practical guidance. They are truly a secret treasure for students and a compass for entrance examinations. Now is the summer vacation, and various schools are recruiting new students, so students from middle schools and above in this city and other places, as well as colleagues in the book industry, are directly writing to the bureau to purchase and wholesale them. Many school authorities have even purchased them in bulk to distribute to graduates so that they can use them as a reference for entrance examinations. However, it is heard that the bureau has a limited number of printed books and not much stock. Because sales are so strong and young people need them urgently, they have already been reprinted.</p>

<p>Since the completion of the new Jiangwan campus of the Southeast Women's Physical Education School, it was moved in last year, and the student development achievements have been excellent, and it has long been valued by the national sports community. Unfortunately, this year, the Shanghai Incident suddenly occurred, and the Jiangwan campus was reduced to a war zone. It was forced to temporarily borrow the Mingguo Women's Arts and Crafts School on Weihaiwei Road for classes. After the war ended, Jiangwan gradually recovered, and the entire school moved back to Jiangwan the other day to hold this year's graduation examination. There are a total of forty-nine graduating students this time. The graduation ceremony was held at the school's gymnasium in Jiangwan on July 18 as usual. In the evening, a graduation alumni dinner was held at Duyi Place. Earlier, Principal Yu Ziyu and Dean 　　　respectfully invited Director Xu of the Municipal Education Bureau and the section chiefs of various sections, as well as 　　　　　　members of the news media and the sports community, also 　　　came together.

<p>Result: Nine to Six</p>
<p>Difficult Hope for Championship</p>
<p>The Chinese Tennis Association originally had enthusiastic hopes for the championship in the lawn tennis Group A league. Based on the past five games (winning 57 sets and losing 18 sets), there was reason to be optimistic. However, the turning point for competing with Japan for the top spot lay in yesterday's battle with Portugal. Although good news came that they won by nine to six, it seemed to be a notch below Japan's record. It may be very difficult for China 　to win this year's championship, and it may belong to Japan.</p>
<p>More than two hundred spectators watched quietly and applauded after enjoying it. The first, second, and third courts were the center of the crowd, and the fourth and fifth courts also had many appreciative spectators.</p>
<p>The Chinese lineup was different from before. The first group, Lin Baohua and Jiang Daozhang, were paired together, and the old couple reunited, giving the audience a lasting impression. The opposing team, Canafanloro and Leite, managed to regain the second set under difficult circumstances, which was no easy feat. In fact, Lin and Jiang could have won in three straight sets. The second group was represented by the up-and-coming stars Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang. They were effective in defeating the enemy in the first two sets, but they lacked stamina in the later stages and lost the last set. The third group, Feng Xikang and Guo Qida, tried their best to negotiate repeatedly, but they ultimately fell short and lost all three sets. The fourth group, Tu Kaiyuan and Qian Yaobin, were the most successful, winning all three sets in one go. Ran Deguang and Ma Anquan also had a clear advantage in the fifth group, winning two sets in a row before suddenly losing one set due to carelessness.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Financial Gold Market in a Process of Mild Weakness <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Down 3 Liang 7 Qian, Yesterday's Standard Gold Was Also Small and Weak, But the Waves Were Calm, and the Front and Rear Markets Only Calculated 3 Liang Zero Rotation, and Finally Subtly Fell 3 Liang 7 Qian. The Actual Selling in the Market Was Not Very Active. Although the Dealers' Intention Was Mild and Weak, the Silver Market Reported a Decline, and the Initial Opening Actually Decreased, Which Was Actually Affected by the Continued Rise in Exchange Rates. Later, It Seemed to Be Complex, and the Price Had a 1 Liang Plus Plate Head. Until the Exchange Rates of British and American Were Stable and Loose, the Market Was Even Weaker Due to the Lack of Market on Wednesday. However, Trading Was Leisurely and Had Returned to Within 750 Liang. The Spot Transaction Was 2 Liang 2 Qian, Still Posted by the Short Side. The Daily Situation Is Recorded Below.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Increased, and Initial Opening Decreased. Since the Opening of September Futures in the Early Morning, It Decreased by 2 Liang 3 Qian to 750 Liang 05 Qian. Big Bar and American Bank Decreased by 1/8 Each, But the Exchange Rate Increased Sharply by Another Point.

Later, Because Tong Tai Chang, Items Hedging, Etc. Came to Sell, It Plunged by 1 Liang Zero to 50 Liang 07 Qian. Yuan Xing Yong Came to Buy, and Zhong Fa, Etc. Bought US Dollars 625 in This Month and 6875 in August, and Then Rose to 51 Liang 7 Qian. HSBC Sold British Gold 180625 (Mumbai In). There Were Many Sellers on the Table, and It Suddenly Broke Through 50 Liang to 49 Liang 3 Qian. At 9:30, HSBC Quoted British Gold, Shortened by Half a Gear, and US Dollars Did Not Change Due to the Increase in Exchange Rates. At That Time, It Was 50 Liang. Later, Mitsui Entered 110,000 US Dollars, 125, and the Gold Price Was Peaceful, Rising and Falling by a Few Coins. From 49 Liang and a Half to 50 Liang 03 Qian, and Then Tong Tai Chang and Heng Yu Sold Again, and It Broke Through 50 Liang Again, Finally Entering 49 Liang 2 Qian. After Entering, Yuan Kang Xiang (Through the Agent of a Certain Firm) and Heng You Bought, and Heng Xing, Fu Xing, Yong Yi Feng, and Yong Tong Chun Followed, and the Price Increased from More Than 9 Liang to 50 Liang Zero. HSBC and Others Absorbed US Dollars 75 in August, and Silver Company Bought 6875 to 10:00, Which Was 51 Liang 4 Qian.

All Came Out, But Yi Feng Yong and Yuan Xing Yong Entered Until 11:00, Which Was Only 50 Liang 01 Qian. Later, Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, and Tong Tai Chang Came to Enter Again, and Pulled Up 1 Liang Zero at 11:30 to 51 Liang 2 Qian. However, the US Dollar Was Loose, and November Should Be 1875. At Noon, It Closed at 50 Liang 07 Qian.</p>
<p>Trading Was Leisurely, and the Market Was Even More Sluggish. The Market Opened at 50 Liang 08 Qian, But Yi Feng Yong and Da De Cheng Run Chang Yu, Etc. Constantly Sold, Falling 1 Liang a Few Coins. At 3:00, It Was 49 Liang. Tong Tai Chang Bought, and Then Added 7 or 8 Qian to 49 Liang 8 Qian. After Entering, There Was a Slight Rise, But There Was No Market for Exchange Bills. Especially Because the Weather Was Hot, There Were Few People in the Market. Then, After 3:30, Tong Chun and Heng Yu, and Scattered Households All Sold, so the Price Was Difficult to Stand, and Finally It Was 48 Liang 8 Qian. In an Instant, Retail Short Sellers Closed and Entered, Especially Scalpers, so It Increased Again to 9 Liang 3 Qian. At 4:00, It Closed at 49 Liang 1 Qian, Which Was Down 3 Liang 7 Qian Compared to the Previous Day. It Continued to Raise to 9 Liang 45 Qian, so the Price of Items Was Large, Adding 4 Qian, and the Calculation for the Item Was Also Adding 9 Liang 5 Qian.</p>

The Market Opened from 2:30 to 4:00, Which Was Implemented from Yesterday (20th).</p>
<h3 id="e119">Foreign Exchange Trends in England and America Show Slight Differences <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>England Tight, America Loose... Still No Major Changes</p>

By the closing of the market at noon, compared to the previous day, the price of British gold showed no significant fluctuation, while the US dollar increased by 0.0625, which was due to the large exchange rate squeeze.

Bombay telegraphed a purchase of September Indian merchant firm and issued an order for October.

<p>The market was sparsely populated. Yesterday, both the morning and afternoon markets were slow due to the heat, and people were reluctant to engage in vigorous business. As a result, the market was sparsely populated, transactions were quiet, and various market prices showed little competition, gradually presenting a desolate and stagnant appearance. The details of yesterday's market are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Both 'Li Chai' saw declines (Foreign 'Li'). The morning price of 'Li' saw sparse trading, and supply and demand were slightly different. As a result, it fell by a small half 'Li' compared to the afternoon session of the previous day, calculated at 6 qian 9 fen 5 li. The afternoon session continued to fall by half 'Li', calculated at 6 qian 9 fen 4 li. The market fell a total of 1 'Li'.

As a result, it fell by 7.5 hao compared to the afternoon session of the previous day. Transactions were 95,000 'jiao' in the morning session and 15,000 'jiao' in the afternoon session. Copper coins were released at 500 'wen', totaling 424,500 'qian wen'. Transactions were 40,000 'qian wen' and several hundred 'wen'.</p>
<p>Silver Deposits and Withdrawals Lacking. Yesterday, bank deposits and withdrawals were limited due to sluggish business and rare inflows and outflows. Chinese merchant deposits and withdrawals of notes were over 1.7 million, loan transactions were over 400,000, and various goods, remittances, taxes, and miscellaneous deposits and withdrawals were 3.34 million. Outgoing warehouse was 600,000. Foreign merchant deposits and withdrawals of notes were over 1.1 million, loans were 400,000, and various miscellaneous deposits and withdrawals were 2.56 million.

<h3 id="e122">Securities and Bonds - Supply Exceeded Demand <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Fell by more than 1 Yuan, Turnover of More Than 5 Million</p>
<p>After-Market Trading Sessions Have Been Suspended</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange implemented the suspension of afternoon trading sessions. However, due to the large fluctuations in the prices of various bonds, the market became very lively. Transactions were very active with various parties entering and exiting. Turnover reached 5,010,500 yuan in just the two morning sessions, of which salt tax accounted for 910,000 and consolidated tax accounted for 855,000 yuan. The others were mostly around 600,000 yuan. However, spot trading of customs duty consolidation, 96 issue, and entire 6 issue remained scarce. Only the salt tax consolidation spot trading saw a turnover of 6,000 yuan in the early market. There was no market for others. As for the bond situation, the sudden deterioration of the diplomatic situation with Japan caused great anxiety among the people. Selling was rampant, resulting in supply exceeding demand, and all prices fell sharply. However, looking at the changes, the prices of all bonds fell quite sharply at the opening. Afterwards, prices were maintained without major fluctuations due to short covering. However, judging from the overall situation, the market sentiment was quite weak. If the diplomatic situation does not improve, bonds may continue to fall.</p>

<h3 id="e123">New York Stock Market Turns Quiet <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>(Report by American Eastern Bank Company)</p>
<p>Trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday was very quiet, with mixed price fluctuations. Total daily turnover was 500,000 shares. All major commodities reported increases on the day, and the market for public bonds was particularly good. Therefore, various stocks advanced slightly in the early market compared to the previous day. Later, as sellers began to become active, prices fell. The closing price showed mixed gains and losses compared to the previous day. The steel industry has improved significantly, as prices are good and commerce and industry are progressing accordingly. Steel is a basic industry with significant influence. The recent production rate has been able to recover to about 15%. However, the reasons for the recent sluggishness in the stock market are difficult to explore. It is said to be due to the spread of news of poor second quarter earnings, but the current situation has already improved. Therefore, if the trend in prices does not change within the day, it may be sufficient to encourage market sentiment. The Dow Jones averages for Tuesday are attached below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm and steady due to buying by traders and short covering, and a lack of sellers. Futures rose by 11 to 13 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 3 to 4 points, and spot prices fell by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged. The Indian cotton market was firm and rising, with Pingguoer up 7 rupees, Aomulala up 5.75 rupees, and Bairuoxi up 4.25 rupees. The original telegram record is on the left (telegram of the 19th):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of various gangs in the Shanghai South rice market was slightly less, about seven or eight. The appetite of urban and rural stores was lighter than the previous market. The opening in the morning was often the same. Top-grade white japonica was set at a price, while second-grade soft rice was 5 fen cheaper. Early and late rice were scarce. The rural appetite was slightly higher, but there was no rise or fall in price. The arrival of foreign "Lu Jian" was dwindling. Large plates were rising by 5 fen. The total daily opening of the "Pujiang hu" was about 1,000 dan.</p>
<p>On the north side of Shanghai, the sources were ten or more. The market was slow. Top-grade white japonica was still at 14 yuan, 5 or 6 jiao. The mid-range was about 12 yuan, 6 or 7 jiao. The opening in the morning was fatigued. Second-grade soft rice was thin. The outer rice had no gains or losses. Yesterday, the arrival of foreign Du Jian was two "tong", totaling 300 shi. Odd lots were completed in numbers of dan. Glutinous rice appetite was rare, and the situation was fatigued.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Foreign Rice Market Turns Weak and Soft <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading between local customers and foreign rice was still active, but the number of transactions was not large, and the price was reduced by a small 3 or 4 fen. The destinations were still mainly Ningbo, the interior, and local streets. The Ningbo gang picked more than 1,000 bags of Chen Xiaojiao. The inland gang handled new Xiaojiao and brown rice. The rest were taken by local rural villages. The total daily turnover was 1,800 bags of Xiaojiao, priced at 9 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen to 8 yuan 9 jiao half. Chen Xiaojiao was more than 1,000 bags, priced at 8 yuan 7 jiao half. There were also 400 bags of brown rice, priced at 7 yuan 9 jiao half. Jia Ladi brown rice was 600 bags, priced at 8 yuan 2 jiao. Siamese rice was 300 bags, priced at 10 yuan 0 jiao 4 fen 7. The city's stock of rice is still more than 1.2 million. Although sales have been active in recent days, there has been no large-scale removal, and the market cannot rise.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Flour Market Generally Slightly Brisk <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market in various months generally resumed a stable state. The quoted price of foreign wheat was better by 3 or 4 jiao, and the attitude of the various factories turned to wait and see. There was no intention to sell in the near and far terms, so although the transaction was quiet, the market atmosphere was stable and good. Because there were generally many floating stocks, there was also a slight purchase. However, in terms of the general trend, Tianjin is gradually becoming more stable, and foreign flour is a huge enemy to local flour. If Tianjin's sales are also taken away by foreign flour, the foothold of local flour is worrying. As a result, this month was better by 5 li than the previous day, August was unchanged, September was better by 5 li, October and November were better by 2.5 li, and December was better by 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Period Wheat in a State of Stagnation <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the period wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market for various months was extremely stagnant. Although the price of foreign wheat was good by 3 or 4 jiao, the slack of people inside and outside the industry was incredible. It was heard that only 3 cars were opened in the morning, and only more than 10 cars were opened in the afternoon. In this market, it is difficult for both buyers and sellers to follow the country. When a firm stand is taken, foreign wheat is sold step by step, so buying and selling are not easy, resulting in waiting and seeing. This month, the long positions have not been raised, but have fallen by a small 3 fen. There have been no rises or falls in the distant periods. The spot wheat market continues to be stable. High-quality goods are gradually rising in price as their quality becomes more sufficient. The opening price of medium-quality 6-combination wheat is 3 taels 0 fen 5. Taicang wheat is 2 taels 8 qian 1 fen, second-grade is 7 qian 7 fen. Pudong wheat is 2 taels 6 qian half, Chongming wheat is 2 taels 7 qian 7 fen, Shuangfeng wheat is 2 taels 8 qian 2 fen, Jiading wheat is 2 taels 8 qian, Wusong wheat is 2 taels 7 qian half. A total of more than 1,700 bags were opened, which was handled by Huafeng Xinda.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Sugar Market - Trading in Taikoo Sugar Active <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Coarse Sugar, White Sugar, Quiet Market, Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for publicly sold sugar saw few transactions and the popularity was slightly flat. No. 24 coarse white sugar from Dutch sugar was still priced at 14 taels 4 qian for high-quality goods, and 14 taels 3 qian for ordinary goods. The market lacked outgoing households, and the market shape was quite firm. No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar were priced at 10 taels 0 qian 7 fen, with a strong trend. Trading in Taikoo sugar gradually became more active, and the price saw a slight decline. The price of the "B" mark was still 16 taels 3 qian, the "CW" mark was 15 taels 8 qian, and the "D" mark was 15 taels 5 qian. There were no increases or decreases compared to before. The "H" mark was out of stock, and the market rose by 5 fen. The transaction price was 12 taels 6 qian. The "PX" mark was 11 taels 2 qian, and the "HX" mark was 15 taels 3 qian. Transactions were very prosperous and decreased by 1 qian compared to before, but the market appearance was very stable and beautiful.</p>

<p>Since the debut of new dried lychees, such as Haikou branch, Shuidong branch, Jinshan branch, and Early Red branch, have arrived one after another. It is heard that the Lanzhu branch and Niaoye branch produced in Zhangzhou will also arrive in Shanghai soon. In terms of land prices, it is still difficult to agree, so the first batch of goods may not be large. It is found that this year's harvest is indeed better than last year's, but it cannot be said to be abundant, so the land price is unwilling to be too cheap for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Silk Tea - Remnants of the Wufu Tea Market <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Wuyuan spring tea sales are still smooth. Due to the recent brisk turn of the Shanghai market, Wuyuan tea shops are still continuing to search for cheap stored tea in the villages of Beiyuan. Yesterday, the transaction price in Che Tian was 50 yuan per scale, 48 yuan in Huangcun, 41 yuan in Xiacun, and 40 yuan in Huangsha. It is estimated that no less than 600 to 700 dan of stored tea have been sold in Beiyuan in the past week, and the number of sales is stronger than before. After a long period of silence, the mountain goods of Zhaoshan Gaozhuang have also been negotiated by the tea merchants for days. The opening price is from 55 yuan to 60 yuan, which is 30 yuan lower than the sales price last year. The mountain households are very frustrated because their income is not enough for the cost of tea and labor. However, they have to lower their prices to sell out of the hardship caused by their livelihood, which is difficult to describe.</p>
<p>There is a gradual motivation to sell tea from Fuliang. The output of green tea in the southeast of Fuliang is still good. Many people who transported Fuliang tea last year made a profit. This year, the local Xiuxiu tea merchants mistakenly expected the tea price to be higher than the old ones, and they all added their value and competed for purchase. They rushed to collect and transport it to the Shanghai market. The market was depressed and the price was unable to rise. Although the customers with goods in hand were eager to promote sales, the suffering merchants rejected them and did not enter, and it was shelved until now that they received the news that the Shanghai market had turned brisk and the low-priced goods were selling. The tea merchants took advantage of this good news to rush the stored goods to Wuzhuang for sale. Recently, the opening price in Wuzhuang has risen to 38 yuan to 40 yuan, and the sales have gradually gained motivation.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Pinghu Large Gang - American Sales Slightly Moved <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Since its listing, the market for Pinghu green tea has been sluggish for a long time. In recent days, Jinlong, Yihe and other firms and China Tea Company have started to handle it. Yesterday, the market agreed to more than 3,000 boxes, and the quoted price was about 5 or 6 taels lower than before. Large gangs in Wuyuan also had scattered retail sales. There is a tendency for American sales of large gangs of colorless tea to move. The road is continuing to be smooth for needle eyebrow and beautiful eyebrow green tea, and the market is rising by 3 or 4 taels. However, transactions for the Jane eyebrow item are still rare.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Tea Merchants Oppose Doubling Tea Tax <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Wan Finance Department of Huizhou Province had initially designated the tax rate on foreign box tea in the province as a special tax, changing the value to 20 out of 100, and sending staff to set up a bureau to specialize in collecting taxes. The tea merchants protested and requested the Ministry of Finance to reduce it. It was approved to handle it according to the case. However, each bureau collected taxes at 5 jiao and 5 fen per box, which was almost double the 2 jiao and 5 fen collected per box last year. Recently, various bureaus along the way have also intercepted box tea and forcibly collected taxes. The Xiuning Zhucun card bureau even committed a murder, causing public outrage. They telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to request a thorough investigation and stop. On one side, the Tunxi Tea Merchants Association sent letters to the trade associations in various counties to pay taxes at 2/1000 of the business income of Anhui Province from this month. The doubling of the harsh taxes of each bureau is resolutely opposed.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Factory Silk - American Sales Still Unchanged <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in the port was still difficult to progress. The American sales of yellow and white factory silk were still unchanged. The British and French firms only had a few decorative transactions, and the price was not strong. Yesterday, Xinfu Dachang and others entered superior grade B-grade products, such as the Three Dancing Golden Double Eagle and other brands, 20 to 22 strands, 30 bales of Shanghai White Factory, priced at 600 taels. Yihe Kaili and others entered 20 bales of wooden machine Yangfan Sichuan yellow factory, 13 to 15 strands, priced at 500 taels.</p>

<p>Words of the old man Ma Xiangbo, recorded by Fuji</p>
<p>I have a firm belief in religion, and I have a special interest in science. Looking up at the universe, I admire the greatness of the Creator. We human beings are uniquely endowed by nature, and we become the spirit of all things. Human beings can study all things, but all things cannot study human beings. I often imagine that the universe is so big, and the sun is in the middle of it. Human beings on earth seem big enough. But how big is the sun after all? Does the sun know itself? When I think of this, I point to the sun and laugh at it for a while.</p>
<p>(O Sun! O Sun!</p>
<p>I recognize you, but you don't recognize me.</p>
<p>Not only do I recognize you,</p>
<p>I also recognize myself.)</p>
<p>Only humans can recognize themselves, so humans are the spirit of all things. Man is the spirit of all things, man can recognize himself, so man can distinguish between good and evil. Some people say, (Good and evil are indefinite, they are created by habit.) I think otherwise, I have evidence to prove it.</p>
<p>When children see a sugar peddler, their mouths are dripping with saliva, but they don't dare to reach out and take it if they don't have money in their pockets. When the father takes out money to buy it, the sugar is in the child's hand, and whoever tries to snatch his sugar, he will cry. Children are human, children have souls, children know their place, children can recognize themselves.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zhang San's dog is hungry and sees Li Si's things, so he snatches them to eat. Where do animals have Zhang San Li Si's division? Here we can see the difference between humans and animals, which is also a powerful proof that humans have souls.</p>

<p>-- Gu Dai</p>
<p>I have a relative living with me who is engaged in the flower and tree business in Japan. He recently returned to his ancestral home in Wenzhou from Japan on the President Wilson. He passed through Shanghai and came to my residence to talk about old times. He also described what he had heard and seen in Japan since the September 18th Incident. In the long summer, I have plenty of time to retell it.</p>
<p>The Japanese have always had a mantra: "Chinese people are not as good as dogs." Therefore, Chinese people in Japan follow the instruction of eating more and speaking less. Because speaking more can lead to humiliation. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have become more arbitrary, even regarding the Chinese as nothing. And they have even gone further and chanted "White people are not to be feared." When the Pan case first occurred, the Japanese were terrified of the intervention of the League of Nations. Therefore, there were often complaints in the newspapers about the recklessness of the army. Later, they saw that the so-called League of Nations was singing its empty city plan, and the Chinese government was still wholeheartedly begging for pity from the League of Nations. Everything was seen through by the Japanese, so they united from top to bottom and boldly went ahead. After occupying Liaoning and Jilin, they invaded Heilongjiang in the north. Their domestic newspapers were full of victory records. The Japanese were very happy, and the Chinese were even more despised. However, although the news of victory kept coming, reinforcements continued to be sent. There were also rumors in the market that so many people were transported back from North Manchuria who had died in battle. Later, it was learned that General Ma had annihilated the Japanese army that had occupied the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin without bloodshed at the Nenjiang Bridge. Therefore, overseas Chinese in Japan seemed to be suspected of being spies for the Black Army. After the Black War stopped, the Shanghai Incident suddenly occurred. The news of the victory of the Japanese army was repeatedly transmitted to Tokyo. However, one week later, the Japanese had not taken a single step into Zhabei, and the conscription of reinforcements and the transportation of military equipment had not ceased. The commanders were changed frequently. Two weeks later, the dead and wounded were still being transported back. Due to the descriptions of the Nineteenth Route Army's divine power by the wounded, the overseas Chinese in Japan were suspected of being spies for the Nineteenth Route Army. After the retreat of the Nineteenth Route Army, the overseas Chinese returned to the status of subjugated slaves. When the Hongkou Park bombing occurred, the first message transmitted to the East said that the murderer was Korean. The overseas Chinese were relieved. However, many overseas Chinese who had dealings with Koreans were monitored because of suspicion. By this point, it was generally believed that all overseas Chinese in Japan were accomplices in the bombing. As the Northeastern Volunteer Army grew stronger and attacked from the east and west, the Japanese were quite embarrassed. The domestic economy became more and more difficult, and conscription was frequent. Young people joined the army, and all industries were stagnant. The overseas Chinese who depended on the Japanese for a living were regarded as bandits and were forced to return to China. On the day of departure, the port was heavily guarded. The baggage they carried was thoroughly searched. All the Japanese currency they carried was confiscated. A little resistance would be met with immediate beatings. The mantra "Chinese people are not as good as dogs" was known to every Japanese person.</p>

<p>-- Lei Sheng</p>
<p>A certain gentleman, hiding his name, is from the South China Sea. Seven or eight years ago, he studied at Waseda University in Japan. He fell ill and was transferred to the hospital. The nurse, Ms. Yoshida, served him diligently. The gentleman was a handsome young man, and Yoshida was also beautiful. They fell in love. After recovering from his illness, he asked someone to introduce them and made a lifelong promise. They both returned to China. The gentleman worked in Shanghai. A son was born and died young. Last winter, the violent sun invaded Shanghai. Japanese expatriates returned one after another. Yoshida said goodbye to the gentleman. The gentleman tried hard to keep her. Yoshida was also hesitant, but she had to leave because of the situation. The gentleman only felt personal feelings and forgot national hatred. He even wanted to secretly follow Yoshida. His younger brother was also in Shanghai. When he heard about it, he urgently summoned his brother to a separate room and kept him there, while Yoshida left. He falsely said that the grandmother was critically ill in the hometown and the brother had already boarded the ship to return. He deeply knew that his brother was confused and could not be moved by words, so he used this thunderous hand. After Yoshida left, he gave his brother freedom and said to him: The ancients said that a resentful couple is an enemy. Now the brother's matter should be reversed and said that an enemy is a resentful couple. The brother is not afraid of ruining his reputation, but does he not care about his conscience? The gentleman knew that there was nothing he could do, so he thanked his brother and said, I was temporarily confused. Without the deep love of the brother, I would not be able to save myself. I said that in the past there were those who were caught in the beauty trap and humiliated the country, called the alliance under the bed. Although the gentleman's personal affairs are also visible to the danger of love, it is enough to warn later generations.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Idle Talk from the Red Chamber <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Junsong</p>
<p>Jia Baoyu said, "(Women are made of water, men are made of mud)." These two sentences are really not wrong. Mud will dissolve once it enters water. When men encounter women, how can they not be dissolved?</p>
<p>To compare important figures of the National Government to characters in "Dream of the Red Chamber": Lin Zichao is comparable to the virtuous and respected Old Lady Shi; Chiang Kai-shek is comparable to the shrewd and capable Wang Xifeng; Wu Zhihui is comparable to the dull-witted Granny Liu; Yu Youren is comparable to the stern and selfless Jiao Da (Apologies to Mr. Yu; be careful not to eat horse manure). Wang Jingwei is comparable to the intelligent and perceptive Baochai; Hu Hanmin is comparable to the sickly and melancholy Daiyu. Only this affectionate Baoyu cannot be compared to any contemporary talents. Alas, let's tentatively compare him to Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<p>When Jia Yucun was trying the Xue Pan manslaughter case, the advice given by the gatekeeper was indeed a "brocade bag" for officialdom, a secret to success in official life. If you are not afraid of power and influence, and disregard all considerations, insisting on doing things your way, then your rice bowl is guaranteed to be smashed immediately. Conversely, if you know how to flatter and ingratiate yourself, then you have the hope of being promoted and becoming wealthy.</p>
<p>Baoyu is, after all, a romantic soul. Even though he married Baochai, he still never forgot Daiyu in his heart, eventually becoming a monk and leaving. In contrast to today's youth who only know the pleasures of physical desire, he is not to be mentioned in the same breath.</p>
<p>Extreme prosperity is followed by decline, and the sun at its zenith must wane. This is a universal principle of natural evolution. When the Grand View Garden was at its peak, what grandeur, what glory, what extravagance! But by the time Baoyu became a monk, the Jia mother had passed away, and the property was confiscated, resulting in the family being broken and ruined. What desolation, what misery, what grief! I sincerely hope that the great and wealthy families of today maintain balance, avoid being too arrogant and extravagant, and constantly take this as a warning. Wang Xifeng's management of the household was considered responsible and willing to work hard. Ultimately, her energy was limited, and her attention could not be everywhere. Therefore, the embezzlement and corruption of her subordinates, and acts of petty theft, occurred frequently. Speaking of China's current politics, it is nothing less than a portrait of this.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Random Talks on Watermelons <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Shizi</p>
<p>Last summer, I wrote about watermelons, saying that the internal corruption of our country's internal affairs is like the inside of a watermelon being rotten, while strong neighbors surround us. Once they wield the knife and try to divide it, this internally rotten watermelon will not even be able to keep its rind. This was originally written from a temporary feeling. Unexpectedly, soon after, the September 18th Incident occurred, carving off a part of Northeast China from our entire China. Unfortunately, my words came true. How painful this is! Another year has passed, and it is summer again. Recalling this, sweat soaks my back. Therefore, I dare not recklessly make presumptions again. I will just write some random notes as embellishments for the hot summer.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I once got a black-skinned watermelon. I would cut off the top and use a spoon to scoop out the pulp, leaving the rind very thin. Then, with a sharp little knife, I would carve extremely fine patterns on the outer skin. I would also lightly apply colors to the carved patterns. I would light a short candle inside and hang it in front of the eaves, cooling off underneath. When the clear breeze came, the sweltering heat would disappear. Sometimes I would float it on the pond, and the swimming fish would compete to chase after it, which was quite interesting. In recent years, I have been bound by responsibilities and commitments, and have had no time to return to my hometown to escape the summer heat. Recalling the scenes of my childhood, I cannot help but be transported in spirit.</p>
<p>Farmers who plant watermelons can earn a profit of about one hundred yuan per acre in years of abundant harvest and high prices by picking them and transporting them to Shanghai for sale. Therefore, farmers in my hometown (east of Kunshan) must plant several acres of watermelons every year. If they can make a profit, then they can be free from worrying about food and clothing for a year. However, growing watermelons is quite speculative. It is not as stable as planting cotton or rice. This is because there are many kinds of animals in the watermelon fields. They come out in groups and can trample almost the entire ten acres of watermelon fields in an hour. Therefore, farmers take turns guarding them all night to prevent animals, and at the same time, they can also prevent thieves. When the watermelons are ripe, they are transported to Shanghai. If at that time, there are consecutive days of cloudy and rainy weather, and the "Red Emperor" (sun) hides its traces, and the watermelons cannot be stored for long, they can only be sold off at a low price, resulting in losses. When we buy watermelons, we smile broadly when the price is cheap, but we do not know that the farmers forget to eat and sleep, and the price they receive may not even be enough to pay the rent and repay the debts (the fertilizer required for watermelons is extremely expensive).</p>
<p>When we eat watermelons, we often discard the rind. In fact, if you remove the pulp from the watermelon rind and leave a two-tenths-inch thick layer of the rind, soak it in a little salt for about five or six hours, then pickle it in soy sauce (or even soybean paste) for about a day and night, then take it out and serve it with meals, it is fragrant, fresh, and tender, and its taste is excellent. It is especially suitable for those who avoid oily foods in the summer. This is also a way to make use of waste. Readers, why not give it a try?</p>

<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>At this time when the days are long like years and the warm winds are like burning embers, the sea of fan exhibitions arises in response to the season. There are four companies, such as the Art Sea Backwater Society, the Lili Company, the Jiuyu Hall, and the Art Appreciation Society, all of which have attracted famous artists with superb calligraphy and painting skills. Only the Appreciation Society in Daqing Lane is organized by Qian Shoutie, a calligrapher, painter, and seal carver. Mr. Qian is heroic and good at making friends. Calligraphers and painters from all over the country are his acquaintances. Therefore, when he makes a call, all the mountains respond. The cooperative fan pieces are all carefully constructed works. Yesterday, I heard the news in the countryside and braved the summer heat to come to Shanghai. I went upstairs and looked all around. The walls were filled with exquisite works, making it a feast for the eyes. However, from my humble perspective, the red and white monthly roses jointly created by Bailong Shanren and Gong Zhan, Zhang Daqian's cattail cushion pine, Qian Shoutie, Chen Xiaodie, Lu Xiaoman, Fei Longding, and Sun Xueni's cooperative landscape paintings and calligraphy, Chen Xiaocui's figure paintings, Zhang Shimin and Wu Qingxia's cooperative plum blossoms and daffodils, Ye Weishen and Zheng Wuchang's cooperative shrimps and crabs, Shang Shengbo and Wang Shizi's cooperative flowers and birds, Ma Qizhou, Chen Xiaomei, Zhang Shanzi, and Xie Yucen's cooperative landscape paintings, Huang Binhong, Wang Zhongshan, Wu Yifeng, and Wang Shengyuan's landscape paintings, Xiong Songquan and Zhang Shanzi's lions and tigers, Shen Moxian's plum blossoms, Hong Shuan's flowers, birds, grass, and insects, Zhao Banpo's flowers, Wu Hufan, Peng Gongfu, He Tianjian, and Huang Suyun's landscape paintings, Ma Wanli's flowers and fruits, and Zhu Wenyun's orchids and bamboos are all famous for a time, without any distinction of rank. As for the newly emerging young people such as Hu Ruosi, Ma Daiyun, Liang Kaishi, and Wu Bin's meticulous imitation of ancient landscape paintings, the famous painter Huang Taixuan's running script paintings, Zhu Qi's flying white script, and Ren Xunshu and Qi Fanniu's running cursive script, all are rare masterpieces of the present time, making people feel as if they are on the road to Shanyin, and there is no time to take it all in. I returned home and recorded it by lamplight.</p>
<h3 id="e141">National Goods Factories Worth Introducing (6) <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>(9) Creosote Oil Factory</p>
<p>Creosote oil is made by mixing rosin and cresol (insecticide) in equal amounts, adding 0.03% caustic soda, and filtering twice.</p>
<p>The method of making cresol is to place coal tar in an iron pot and burn it intensely. It must be between 190 degrees and 270 degrees Celsius for the original material to change and become a type of cresol. Lysol, which is used in surgery, and naphthol, are both made from cresol. Creosote oil is a necessary product in summer. Its function is to kill insects and remove odors. In the past, most of the creosote oil came from Japan. Since the domestic creosote oil has been produced and sold, Japanese goods have been eliminated from the market. Currently, there are Yalin Creosote Oil Factory, whose products are the "Microscope" brand, and Asia Creosote Oil Factory, whose products are the "Double Knife" brand, in Shanghai. Others, such as the "Eagle" brand, are also well-known. The larger ones are packed in 40-gallon barrels. The market price is one yuan and three jiao per gallon, seven jiao for half a gallon, and four jiao for a quarter of a gallon.</p>
<p>Creosote oil factories often also make mothballs. The method is to use the above-mentioned naphthol, refine it with legal spirits, extract a kind of white block, and press it with a machine to make mothballs. Each pound sells for two jiao. This is a necessary item in wardrobes and bookshelves to prevent insect damage.</p>
<p>(10) Sun Umbrella Factory</p>
<p>Most of the sun umbrella manufacturers in Shanghai operate through division of labor. The poles, handles, ribs, and canopies are all made by the respective factories. The sun umbrella factory buys them and assembles them. However, Huali Shi mostly makes them themselves. Among them, making the ribs is more complicated. There are three or four factories in Shanghai that specialize in making umbrella ribs, such as the Sanxing Umbrella Rib Factory in Xiaoximen. The ribs are made of mild steel wire or steel wire, which is rolled, wheeled, and drilled by machine. The price is two yuan to two yuan per dozen, divided into black and white colors, and 3-foot and 2.8-inch sizes.</p>
<p>Most of the poles are made of foreign pine, each costing three to four cents. The quality of the handles varies. Some are made of wood, some are made of metal, and some are made of imitation treasures. In the past, they were all Japanese goods, but now they are mostly replaced by domestic goods. The most common wooden handles cost about nine jiao per dozen.</p>
<p>The materials used for the canopy also vary. Second- and third-class goods mostly use black factory cloth. A piece of 40 yards costs ten yuan. The canopies of first-class goods mostly use Western twill satin. Women's umbrellas use silk.</p>
<p>There are more than 30 sun umbrella factories in Shanghai, the larger ones being Huali Shi, Xin Dalu, Xin Datong, Minhua, Zhenhua, Meili, etc. Each factory produces 70 to 80 dozen or 20 to 30 dozen umbrellas per day. The price ranges from 11 yuan to more than 20 yuan per dozen. Women's silk umbrellas cost 50 to 60 yuan per dozen. The workers are paid by piece, such as two cents per umbrella for hemming and one cent per umbrella for attaching the top. After the umbrella top is attached, it must be steamed once to make the umbrella canopy flat and durable.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Northeast Customs Seized, We Will Reduce Foreign Debt Repayments <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>If necessary, all Japanese personnel in Liaoning customs will be dismissed. After the customs revenue of Dalian and the Northeast was seized by the puppet state instigated by the Japanese, we protested seriously to Japan twice. Recently, Chief Inspector of Customs, Mr. Moyler, decided to wait for the implementation of the blockade since Japan had not officially responded to the Dalian customs matter. Regarding the repayment of foreign debt, the government has reached an agreement with the countries concerned to reduce the amount of repayment. The transitional measures after the blockade will remain the same.</p>
<p>Reduced repayment of foreign debt. The seizure of customs in the Northeast has resulted in an average annual loss of more than 39 million yuan in national tax revenue. The repayment of foreign debt mortgaged with this tax revenue has been greatly affected. Japan, disregarding the sovereignty of our government and believing that we will be unable to cope, even promoted so-called mediation measures to cover up its crime of instigating the puppet state to seize the customs. This so-called mediation measure is not only difficult for our government to recognize, but also unacceptable to the countries concerned. However, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a method of reducing the repayment amount in consultation with the countries concerned. As a result, the countries have fully agreed. However, the amount of reduction has not yet been determined, and the parties are still in consultation. Roughly, the amount will be calculated in proportion to the amount of tax revenue in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Liaoning Customs Blockade According to reliable sources, since the Chief Inspector of Customs proposed Mr. Anesaki to succeed Mr. Fukumoto as the Customs Officer of Dalian Customs and sought the consent of the Japanese, the Japanese have not officially replied. The news of rejection and consent previously reported by the Japanese propaganda agencies contained an intention. Chief Inspector of Customs Mr. Moyler has inquired to the Japanese Embassy twice and has already issued an ultimatum in the style of an ultimatum. He is now waiting for the reply. If the Japanese side still does not reply by the deadline, or if the reply is not satisfactory, we will resolutely and quickly blockade the customs of the Northeast. At the same time, a statement will be issued stating the responsibility. There are no problems with the post-blockade measures by the countries concerned. The countries have not recognized the puppet state, so the legitimate customs organization is ours. If the puppet state collects double taxes, it will throw a huge bomb at the business communities in Dalian, South Manchuria, and other parts of the Northeast. The Japanese government may not be able to predict this future fact.</p>
<p>Transitional Measures The tax authorities discussed the transitional measures before the blockade of the Northeast customs a few days ago, and decided to continue the existing general measures. It is said that the authorities expect that if the Japanese side does not reply and implements the blockade, it will not take long, so there is no need to take this matter in this shortest period.</p>
<p>Dismissal of Japanese Personnel Mr. Fukumoto, the Customs Officer of Dalian Customs, disobeyed orders and resigned. All Japanese customs officers in Dalian and other parts of the Northeast followed suit. Mr. Moyler was extremely angry about this and mentioned this matter in the statement announcing the dismissal of Mr. Fukumoto as Customs Officer. After consultation by the authorities, it has been decided that if the customs duties of the Northeast cannot be resolved satisfactorily, other Japanese customs officers will be dismissed except for those with special circumstances to prevent future troubles.</p>
<p>Japan Claims Difficulty The Japanese side instigated the puppet state to seize the customs duties, but did not expect that we still have this move. Because they made the mistake, they then felt that our attitude was tough. In recent days, they have delayed expressing their opinion on the dismissal of Mr. Fukumoto and the succession of Mr. Anesaki. According to people in diplomatic circles, this is a sign of fear. It is said that the Japanese side is in a dilemma at this time. If they agree to the succession of Mr. Anesaki, the new Customs Officer of Dalian, then the seizure of the customs in the Northeast clearly shows that the Japanese side admits to instigating it. Otherwise, if we implement the blockade, the puppet customs will not have any benefits, and the Japanese businesses in the Northeast, especially the city of Dalian and the South Manchuria Railway, will be severely hit.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Our Measures for the Northeast Postal Service <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>We will definitely blockade it if necessary.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Far East News Agency visited the Director-General of the Postal Administration yesterday to inquire about the attitude of our government towards the Northeast postal service. He was received by the Deputy Director, who gave the following responsible speech.</p>
<p>Current Status According to him, since the Mukden Incident, the Northeast postal service has been able to maintain itself until now thanks to the perseverance and courage of the responsible personnel. After the establishment of the puppet state, the Japanese instigated and used various methods to sabotage and threatened with alarming words, but they were ignored. Therefore, at present, all bureaus in the three provinces are operating as usual, with no changes from before the incident. Letters and remittances can be sent smoothly, and efforts are being made to shorten delivery times. Although the territory of the Northeast has changed, the postal service can still maintain its independent spirit in the midst of storms, which is due to the efforts of the employees and responsible persons in the three provinces.</p>
<p>Japanese Arrangements Seeing that repeated sabotage had failed to achieve their goals, the Japanese instigated the puppet state to actively arrange illegal seizure. According to reports received by the General Administration, the Japanese have already printed a large number of stamps for the puppet state and transported them to Liaoyang. They have also appointed a large number of puppet directors and puppet inspectors. It is said that the stamps will be issued on August 1st. Whether they will forcibly send personnel to seize the bureaus on August 1st has not yet been reported. However, the skilled postal workers summoned by the Japanese side are now being assigned to various important areas to wait for orders.</p>
<p>Government Determination Our government has long been aware of the Japanese instigation of the puppet state to seize our Northeast postal rights, so it has been prepared. The Ministry has made a decision on a concrete plan a few days ago. However, due to the matter involving diplomatic secrets, it is not convenient to announce it. In short, the Northeast postal service is an important lifeline of transportation and economy in the Northeast. We will never allow anyone to seize it. In any case, we will not hesitate to completely blockade the Northeast postal service if necessary.</p>

<p>They were carried in armored vehicles and carried maps</p>
<p>The Takeover Committee negotiated on the basis of reason and stopped them</p>
<p>On the 14th and 15th, more than 30 armed Japanese soldiers in the jurisdiction of the 2nd Branch of the 7th District of the Public Security Bureau near Xiangyin Road took nine armored vehicles, carried maps, and conducted simulated shooting exercises, causing extreme panic among residents. Yao Benyuan, the head of the 2nd Branch of the 7th District, repeatedly negotiated to no avail, so he reported to the Public Security Bureau and the Takeover Committee at the same time, requesting that they negotiate on the basis of reason. Mr. Yao received an order from the Takeover Committee yesterday stating that the report had been received and that the committee had sent a special commissioner, Jin Gong, to negotiate with the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Military Headquarters, Mr. Samejima. According to the reply, they had met with Mr. Samejima and discussed the previous situation. It was said that the exercise was organized by a training area and involved only a few soldiers, and that there were no other intentions. They immediately negotiated on the basis of reason, and it was agreed that in the future, all exercises should be unarmed and the Public Security Bureau should be notified in advance. They should only depart after obtaining permission. Furthermore, carrying maps was not a normal practice and should be stopped to avoid misunderstandings. The Chief of Staff promised that there would be no objections. This order was for information.</p>

<p>Japanese expatriates elected Lin Jixiong to offer condolences</p>
<p>What do our citizens think about this?</p>
<p>According to Shi Wen She, after the Kwantung Army blatantly invaded Rehe on the 18th under the pretext of the murder of liaison officer Kenshiro Ishimoto, the local Japanese expatriate community received an urgent telegram from the local Japanese military authorities. In addition to reporting the plan to invade Rehe to the expatriates, they also requested that representatives be sent to offer condolences to the fighting troops. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., the Shanghai Japanese Residents Group and the Veterans Association jointly issued a letter inviting various groups, such as the various Chambers of Commerce Joint Association and the Industrial Comrade Association, to hold a joint meeting at the Japanese Club on Wenshi Road to discuss the measures to send representatives to offer condolences to the Japanese army invading Rehe. At the meeting, Mr. Lin Xiongliji, the chairman of the previous delegation who went to the Northeast to offer condolences to the Japanese army in the name of Shanghai-Japanese expatriates, first discussed the selection of representatives and the issue of funding. Then, they discussed the condolence measures. After two hours of discussion, it was decided that (1) Mr. Lin Xiongliji would continue to serve as the representative to visit the Japanese army in the Northeast. The funding was tentatively set at 3,000 yuan, with 1,000 yuan for travel expenses for the representative and 2,000 yuan for purchasing condolence items. This funding would be borne separately by the various groups. (2) It was decided to rush to make 3,000 condolence bags containing food such as beer and biscuits. They then discussed the departure date and itinerary. It was decided that the departure date would be August 1st. They would first go to Qingdao, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places to contact the local Japanese expatriates in order to expand the movement to offer condolences to the army outside the Great Wall.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Joint Association of Public Organizations</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Public Organizations issued a telegram yesterday stating: "National Government Executive Yuan, we humbly submit that the Northeast disaster has been going on for ten months. At first, you advocated non-resistance to cut off the enemy, and then you spoke empty words of long-term resistance and watched the failure of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, allowing the Japanese bandits to calmly deploy and establish a puppet state, plunging 30 million people in the Northeast into iron hoofs with no way to appeal. Now that the puppet state has been established, the imperialist aggressors have gradually completed their plan to occupy the Northeast. Recently, there have been rumors that they will use the puppet state to restore the Great Qing Dynasty to attack Rehe, invade Yu Guan, covet Pingjin, and attempt to encompass North China. Considering the rumors before the Northeast and Songhu incidents, can it be said that there is no basis? You who hold the national administration have failed in the past, so why do you still procrastinate and allow the enemy bandits to ride into the pass to inundate our North China and poison the whole country? According to news from Pingjin, the Japanese army is currently selecting young people from the Northeast in the name of the puppet state to train an army of 250,000, which will drive long into the area in September. Recently, the Japanese Vice Chief of Staff Mazaki was in Manchuria to plan this matter. Can the officials of the authorities not have heard about it and what kind of preparations have been made? The Northeast volunteer army has been fighting desperately with the enemy for several months, but we have not heard of the government providing any bullets or food. How can we necessarily sit and watch the annihilation of our volunteer army to promote Japan's continental aggression policy of first destroying the Northeast and then annexing the whole country? The enemy's flames are arrogant and dare to challenge the brilliant plan. Shanghai Joint Association of Public Organizations respectfully bows."</p>

<p>However, the withdrawal date is not yet determined.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Gonda and Toyota cotton mills, it was reported yesterday that the Japanese authorities refused to withdraw under the pretext that there were troops stationed in the two mills before the January 28 Incident. However, the Central News Agency reporter learned the following from both Chinese and Japanese sources yesterday: (1) Our side repeatedly questioned Mr. Okazaki, the Japanese commissioner, because the small number of Japanese troops stationed in the Gonda and Toyota cotton mills violated the ceasefire agreement. Mr. Okazaki also stated that he was preparing to withdraw and would not refuse to withdraw because there were troops stationed in the two mills before the January 28 Incident, violating the ceasefire agreement. (2) Mr. Okazaki stated that there were only about 20 Japanese troops stationed in each of the two mills and that they were preparing to withdraw, but the exact date had not yet been determined.</p>

All preparations have been completed, and he is scheduled to take the Great Lakes Steamship Company's President Hoover to the United States tomorrow morning, and then transfer to Europe. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in six months. Yesterday, he purchased ship tickets from the Great Lakes Steamship Company.

<p>Talk about aviation construction and air defense equipment</p>
<p>It is only effective when the government and the people cooperate</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 18th to attend the opening ceremony of Mr. Chen Yingshi's Memorial Hall. The reporter visited Mr. He at his residence yesterday and had the following conversation: (Question) Is the Minister aware of the details of the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe? (Answer) I have only seen reports of the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe in the newspapers and have not received any official reports. (Question) Has the government made sufficient preparations for national defense? (Answer) The government has of course made considerable preparations for national defense, but this can only be effective when the government and the people cooperate sincerely. The people of Shanghai deeply felt the necessity of aviation construction and air defense equipment during the January 28 Incident, but now that Japanese aircraft have flown to the Northeast to bomb, the people of Shanghai seem to have forgotten about aviation construction and air defense equipment. If every person in Shanghai contributes one yuan, several million yuan can be raised, and aviation construction and air defense equipment can be realized. Therefore, when we talk about national defense, we must realize that it is only effective when the people and the government cooperate sincerely, and it is not effective to merely chant high-sounding slogans. The establishment of the National Aviation Association is the beginning of the people and the government cooperating to expand national defense. There is another point about national defense that the people should pay attention to. In all the places passed through by the National Army to suppress the Communists, the Communists stationed there often communicate with the people and transfer all the supplies in advance. Not only are there no locals who are familiar with the area to guide the army, but there are also no food supplies for the army. Therefore, this is a difficult point in the work of suppressing the Communists. If the people lack complete defense projects against the invasion of foreigners, they should resist with the policy of "strengthening the walls and clearing the fields." However, the people not only do not do this, but some even willingly become traitors and seek glory by betraying the country. These people are the common enemy of the people. (Question) Where will the Shanghai Arsenal be moved? (Answer) Shanghai is not suitable for setting up an arsenal, so it has been decided to move it to another place, but the address has not yet been determined. (Question) What is the progress of the Communist suppression recently? (Answer) The Red bandits in the provinces are all fleeing east and west, and our army is deploying a encirclement to try to clear them. Therefore, there has been no major contact on the front line recently. (Question) When will the Minister return to Nanjing? (Answer) I am scheduled to return to Nanjing by night train tonight (that is, last night). (Question) Will you go to Jiangxi after returning to Nanjing? (Answer) I will stay in Nanjing for the time being. If necessary, I will go to Jiangxi again, because there is a special round trip steamer, which is very convenient.</p>

<p>Meeting Tomorrow Night to Welcome Three Representatives Returning from Guangdong</p>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Grand Alliance for the Abolition of Civil War held its eighth preparatory meeting at 4 Hong Kong Road at 3:30 PM yesterday. Xu Ji, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Zheqing, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Zhanen, Yan Esheng, and others attended to discuss the following items:</p>
<p>Number of Provinces Joining as Initiators: The secretariat reported that as of July 19th, a total of 203 organizations and 493 individuals from 23 provinces and cities had joined as initiators, categorized by province as follows: Hebei Province: 2 organizations, 3 individuals; Shandong Province: 12 organizations, 11 individuals; Shanxi Province: 4 organizations, 1 individual; Henan Province: 6 organizations, 6 individuals; Shaanxi Province: 2 organizations; Sichuan Province: 3 individuals; Yunnan Province: 1 organization; Anhui Province: 8 organizations, 31 individuals; Jiangsu Province: 19 organizations, 40 individuals; Zhejiang Province: 15 organizations, 15 individuals; Hubei Province: 56 organizations, 48 individuals; Hunan Province: 9 organizations, 10 individuals; Guangdong Province: 5 organizations, 16 individuals; Guangxi Province: 1 organization; Suiyuan: 1 individual; Shanghai City: 18 organizations, 77 individuals; Nanjing City: 5 organizations, 17 individuals; Beiping City: 4 organizations, 77 individuals; Tianjin City: 5 organizations, 103 individuals; Zhangjiakou: 1 organization; Overseas Chinese: 16 organizations, 12 individuals; and 17 individual members with unknown provincial affiliation. The total is 203 organizations and 493 individuals, totaling 696.</p>
<p>Postponement of the Representative Congress Date: The meeting discussed the postponement of the congress date. The original date for the congress was August 6th in Shanghai. However, since the initiators now span 23 provinces and regions, representatives from remote and inaccessible areas may not be able to arrive in Shanghai in time, and it would be even more difficult for overseas Chinese to arrive as scheduled. Therefore, the date of the representative congress had to be postponed. It was decided to postpone it to August 27th, and the location will still be the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The duration is tentatively set for two days. All initiating organizations will be notified immediately.</p>
<p>Welcoming Representatives Returning from Guangdong Tomorrow Night: Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Mr. Chen Liting, and Mr. Liang Zhao, who went to Guangdong Province on behalf of the organization, have completed their mission and will return to Shanghai on the Hoover President. The organization will hold a meeting at 7:00 PM on the 22nd to welcome them and request the three representatives to report on their negotiations.</p>

<p>Three Settlement Terms</p>
<p>The labor dispute at Feng Cunren Pharmacy on Sanma Road has been successfully resolved through the mediation of Du Yuesheng. All employees fully resumed work yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Du's Mediation: After the Feng Cunren Pharmacy employees declared a strike, both labor and management insisted on their positions, leading to a serious stalemate that lasted for half a month. Du Yuesheng, along with Mr. Chen Junyi, Chen Cunren, and Lin Meiyan, recognizing that prolonged confrontation during the hot summer would inevitably endanger patients' lives, accepted the invitation of both parties to mediate in a private capacity. They convened representatives from the labor side (Zhao Zhenhui, Yuan Pinzhang, Feng Xingkang) and the Feng Cunren Pharmacy small group (Ye Yazhang, Fang Qinghe), as well as representatives from the management side (Feng Mengling, Feng Ziyi), to discuss a resolution. A decision was made on three settlement terms, to which both parties agreed. After the labor representatives sought the opinions of the employees, they also found the terms satisfactory, and the dispute was resolved.</p>
<p>Settlement Terms: The three settlement terms agreed upon the day before yesterday are as follows: (1) One month's worth of the year-end bonus under the name of Feng Cunren's main store will be paid first. The remainder will be settled after the accounts are audited and surplus funds are available. Bonuses under the name of Jia Guang Raw Drug Store will be issued as usual. (2) The substitute worker system will be implemented according to the conditions. (3) The management will provide 570 yuan for the workers' food and lodging expenses during the strike period (calculated at 30 yuan per day).</p>
<p>Reopening Today: Feng Cunren Pharmacy suffered significant losses due to the strike and business suspension. Now that the dispute has been resolved and all employees returned to work yesterday, the management has decided to resume regular business operations starting today.</p>

<p>After a labor dispute occurred at the Sanyou Industrial Corporation's main factory in Yinxiang Township, all workers accepted the Social Affairs Bureau's advice to stop the encirclement and petition. The retail department resumed business operations yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resumption of Business Operations: The main factory workers accepted the government's advice and stopped petitioning at the Nanjing Road retail department yesterday. The company resumed business operations at the retail department yesterday morning and issued a notice to the public, stating: "[Notice] Due to the disturbance caused by former workers from Yinxiang Port at the retail department on the 16th of this month, business operations were temporarily suspended. We have now decided to resume regular business operations starting today." At the same time, the detectives stationed at the retail department and the first dormitory by the police department were withdrawn yesterday.</p>
<p>Issuance of Food Allowances: The Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union, along with representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the company at 11:00 AM yesterday to collect the fifth installment of food allowances, totaling 840 yuan. Regarding the labor dispute case, the Social Affairs Bureau received instructions from the municipal government yesterday, ordering them to comply with previous orders to properly handle the case and submit a report. The bureau decided to formally convene a mediation committee again in the shortest possible time, and invite the municipal party headquarters and the Public Safety Bureau to participate in the joint handling in order to resolve the dispute as soon as possible and avoid the expansion of the labor unrest.</p>
<h3 id="e155">The Causes and Consequences of the Dafeng Labor Dispute <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the unresolved issues of the Dafeng labor dispute, the responsible members of the Chinese General United Association stated yesterday that the Dafeng Factory joined the association as a basic member two years ago. In January of this year, due to the war, the workers were dismissed and their wages were paid off. The workers were laid off. After March 1st, as local order gradually recovered, the factory reopened. Under austerity policies, 109 workers were laid off, each receiving a severance pay of 30 yuan, which they all received.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Not long after, the laid-off workers went to the factory to demand work, but the factory refused.</p>
<p>On March 31st, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation, and both parties reached an agreement, allowing the laid-off workers who had already received severance pay to temporarily sever ties with the factory. When the factory's business recovers to its original state in the future, the old workers will be given priority for employment. On May 5th, after the signing of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, the laid-off workers came to Shanghai one after another to demand entry into the factory. Thus, the point of contention between the two parties focused on whether the business had recovered to its original state. During this period of dispute, the workers once rushed into the workshop, and the management closed the factory twice to prevent the workers from invading and occupying the factory and destroying the machinery. The situation between the two parties was extremely tense. On June 11th, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated again and guaranteed the workers' actions, and the management reopened the factory. However, the root cause was not eliminated, and there was still no hope of reconciliation. On the 28th, the Social Affairs Bureau convened the last mediation, and both parties signed three agreements: (1) Maintain the entire first mediation, and the factory will give each worker 10 yuan for their travel expenses back home. (2) The factory shall, within the possible scope, consider restoring work. (3) If they voluntarily sever ties with the factory, each person will be given a subsidy of 80 yuan. Unexpectedly, although the labor side signed this agreement, they were not satisfied. On July 14th and 15th, they went on strike and obstructed work. The Public Safety Bureau took strict measures to arrest 15 workers and send them to court for processing. The union also announced the end of the strike on the 19th of this month. This is the general situation of the Dafeng labor dispute. It was finally stated that the restoration of work was impossible due to the situation. First, Dafeng's production capacity was greatly reduced due to the war. Second, according to the spirit of the original text of the second mediation, it was originally possible to employ within the possible scope. Now that the labor side has launched the former and adopted a forceful solution, an impossible situation has been created within the possible scope, which is very regrettable.</p>

<p>Must Be Conducted After the Trans-Boundary Road Construction Case is Resolved</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that the issue of trans-boundary road construction and telephones has been under negotiation since 1927, but no substantial results have been achieved. After the Shanghai War, the negotiations were suspended indefinitely. The municipal government is now actively pursuing the issue of trans-boundary road construction, so the telephone issue should be handled after the trans-boundary road construction case is resolved. However, the Shanghai Telephone Company installed 289 telephone subscribers in the trans-boundary road construction area of ​​western Shanghai from January to April this year, and has added many more since May. The Municipal Public Works Bureau is dissatisfied with this and will raise the issue together during future negotiations. As for the issue of the Shanghai Telephone Company inviting the municipal government to pay a certain amount of deposit money for telephones connecting the concession and South Shanghai and Zhabei, the issue will also be discussed during the negotiations.</p>

<p>Restructuring with a Special Property Custody Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association, through a temporary meeting of member representatives, resolved to reorganize the Special Property Custody Committee into a Money Trade Joint Reserve and is actively preparing to formally establish it soon.</p>
<p>Restructuring the Reserve: After the Shanghai Incident, the Money Trade Association organized the Money Trade Special Property Custody Committee on February 1st in order to maintain financial regulation of the market. Eighty members joined, collecting a total of 27 million in property reserves. Now that the order in Songhu has been restored to its pre-war state, a meeting of temporary member representatives was held the day before yesterday and resolved to change it to a Money Trade Joint Reserve.</p>
<p>About to be Established: All the articles of association for the Money Trade Joint Reserve have been drafted by Secretary Qin Xiqing and should be ready soon. It was decided to submit the revisions at the executive committee meeting of the Trade Association on the 25th and formally announce the establishment at the general meeting of all member representatives on August 2nd, as well as elect executive and supervisory committee members. The number of committee members will be nine executive members and three to five supervisory members. If necessary, a temporary meeting of member representatives will be convened within the month so that it can be established as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Increasing Funds: A reporter from the New Sound Agency visited Mr. Qin Xiqing, Secretary of the Money Trade Association, yesterday. According to him, the tasks of the joint reserve are: (1) Interbank lending; (2) Interbank transfers. It has now been decided to transfer the 27 million in property reserves from the various members of the Special Property Custody Committee to the Joint Reserve Fund, and to collect another 3 million in cash, totaling 30 million yuan. It was decided that the various members will deposit their cash into the reserve on the 24th of this month. There are a total of 80 members, each of whom previously deposited one ten-thousand-tael yuan and five thousand yuan in cash into the reserve fund. Now, each member will deposit another fifteen thousand yuan, totaling about thirty-five thousand yuan per member. For 80 members, the total will be about three million yuan as a fund.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Electric Affairs Public Welfare Association Cables Opinions on Reforming Electric Affairs <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Electric Affairs Public Welfare Association yesterday sent a cable to the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, stating: "To Director (Vice) of the Ministry of Communications, Director of the Electric Affairs Department: We have learned that former Director of the Electric Affairs Department Li Fanyi's inappropriate actions have led to numerous disputes. Now that Director Zhong is back in charge of Electric Affairs, people in the electric industry deeply rejoice. Based on our sincere love for electric affairs, we respectfully offer our humble opinions. We believe that wired and wireless communications are both communications businesses, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The two must complement each other and be determined by the time and place of implementation. However, we have only heard of ordering wireless equipment from Marconi and other companies, which is redundant. The obsolete wired equipment and the ruined circuits are disregarded, leading to today's deformed development. We do not know that the existing equipment at the international radio station has the potential to increase its transmission capacity. At this time of financial difficulty, there is no need to order new equipment. This is the first thing we ask you to correct. The promotion and demotion of electrical technicians should follow established regulations to prevent competition and eliminate loss of integrity. However, during Director Li's tenure, there were quite a few electrical technicians who were suspended for no reason, and it was even more common for private individuals to serve as technicians, determining salaries based on personal relationships. The technicians' regulations are like waste paper. If this trend continues, the conscientious will degrade themselves to seek money, and the cunning will exploit opportunities and forget shame. What future is there for electrical affairs? This is the second thing we ask you to correct. Although the cash concentration method is undeniably commendable, it is appropriate to adjust surpluses and deficits. However, the cash has already been concentrated, but the salary arrears of the various bureaus are still accumulating. Letters and telegrams are ignored, while the International Telecommunications Bureau, which has the highest income, is exempt from the centralization order. There is widespread discontent. This is the third thing we ask you to correct. Moreover, we cannot help but speak out. Our country's telecommunications business has reached a critical juncture. If we do not quickly plan for rectification, bankruptcy will be imminent. Now that Director Zhong is back in charge of Electric Affairs, we secretly hope for a revival. We hope that you will carefully consider our situation, quickly and effectively merge wired and wireless communications to eliminate disputes and reduce expenses, thoroughly reform the bad system to clear accumulated problems, and allocate funds to repair the trunk lines of various provinces to facilitate communication. Our association, representing more than 20,000 employees, respectfully requests and impatiently awaits orders. Electric Affairs Public Welfare Association of the Ministry of Communications."</p>

<p>If there is any further delay, business licenses will be revoked. The Shanghai-Baoshan Farmland Bureau recently issued a notice yesterday due to the upper-level authorities' urgent request to pay the farmland compensation arrears in the district under its jurisdiction. The original text of the notice is as follows: "Notice: Regarding the farmland compensation case, orders have been repeatedly issued to urge business households to pay the arrears. However, it has been found that many business households are still watching and ignoring the orders, which is extremely cunning. However, the Property and Political Office stipulated in the resolution on urging the payment of farmland compensation that the bureau should submit a request for punishment. However, considering that the business households are scattered and the previous notices may not have been widely known, if punishment is given suddenly, the business households will suffer significant losses. In order to give extra consideration and remedy the factual difficulties, a joint county notice has been issued to strictly limit and urge payment. You must know that this payment is the inherent income of the country, how can it be allowed to be delayed for a long time? Now, this bureau has been ordered to strictly urge the payment of arrears and set a deadline for reporting and resolution, and no delay is allowed. The director of this bureau is responsible and cannot be a substitute for others. In addition to first opening a list of business households with outstanding payments and sending a letter to the Land Bureau to stop the increase in grain and renewal of certificates, all business households with outstanding payments should quickly comply and rush to the bureau to pay the should-be-paid field price together with the beach photos within one month from the date of the county notice (July 30th to August 30th). If there is any further delay, they will be dealt with separately in accordance with the regulations, and an order will be sent to implement the detention and revoke the business licenses of the business households, reissue half of the land evidence, and recover the remaining half to issue a summons for change. This director's order is issued, but it will definitely not be lenient, and be careful not to treat it as a mere formality and cause self-harm. Be sure to abide by it."</p>

<h3 id="e162">Citizens' Association Asks for the Promotion of Rent Reduction and Exemption <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Letters to the Municipal Party Department and Three Courts The Shanghai Citizens' Association yesterday submitted letters to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Special District First Local Court, the Shanghai Special District Second Local Court, and the Shanghai Local Court for rent reduction and exemption, requesting consideration of citizens with weak economic capacity. The following is a transcript of the submission:</p>
<p>Submission to the Municipal Party Department: Respectfully submitted, the citizens of Shanghai with weak economic capacity have already been facing difficulties since the world economic recession, the high price of gold and the cheap price of silver, and the floods in various provinces. The various painful states of the Japanese army coming to Shanghai to disturb the situation are like icing on the cake. The only thing that these citizens lack is weak economic capacity, but their hard work, dedication, and public-spiritedness are truly rare. They are always eager to donate money for disaster relief, comfort Ma Zhanshan, aid the 19th Route Army, and relieve the disaster-stricken people, even when they have no money to reduce and no means to save. The hope for rent reduction and exemption is originally to solve difficulties by themselves, and indirectly it is to seek the gradual restoration of the market. Renting out buildings for rent is also a legal matter to seek profit, but the unexpected benefits they get at ordinary times are really uncountable. The cost of digging fees, small rents, and opening doors is almost equal to the total cost of building the house, or even more. They use relocation to achieve the purpose of increasing the rent by 20% to 100%, which is even more commonplace. As for all the contributions they make to the society and the country, purchasing government bonds and treasury bills is avoided as much as possible, and donating money for disaster relief is limited to those who own little property and are enthusiastic about society and the country, such as Wang Xiaohui, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, etc. As for the anti-Japanese consolation money and patriotic donations, those who avoided going to Hong Kong existed, those who fled back to their original home existed, and there were iron doors as deep as the sea, with no way to ask. Most of the landlords in the special zone claimed to be foreign properties. Considering the situation and reasoning, from a fair point of view, the generations who only seek private interests, the administrative offices, and the judicial yamen rely on the provisions of the law and the needs of the facts. It is not too harsh to do their duties today. Moreover, what they lose is only a little of their past inappropriate profits and increasing their inexhaustible source of wealth. If we do not plan for it now, the citizens with weak economic capacity will either sit and wait for death, and all commercial bankruptcies will become unemployment, or they will organize small real estate companies that rent land and build houses day and night to raise prices and rents to each other, causing China's economic center and the world's commercial hub to lose its cohesion and become Chicago in the United States in succession. The method set by the Shanghai Municipal Government for the rent reduction and exemption problem can be justified for its difficulty in avoiding taboos and throwing stones at rats. However, based on the needs of the facts and the location of public interest, it seems that there is no need to worry and dare to do it. Why is it better for one family to cry than for the whole road to cry? Even if the demands of citizens with weak economic capacity are met, it will not lead to the tragedy of one family crying, but to prevent the tragedy of crying when they see the coffin. We have always known that your department takes the late Prime Minister's legacy of seeking the interests of the people as its duty. We respectfully ask you to use the power granted by law and promote the purpose of rent reduction and exemption based on the needs of the facts. The restoration of Shanghai's prosperity really depends on it.</p>
<p>Submission to the Three Courts: Also submitted to the Shanghai Special District First Local Court, the Shanghai Special District Second Local Court, and the Shanghai Local Court: Respectfully submitted, the port of Shanghai has suffered from the world economic recession, the sharp drop in silver prices, the floods in the Yangtze River area, and the recent disturbances by the Japanese army. The above effects, even if there is only one, citizens with weak economic capacity are directly or indirectly difficult to escape its oppression, let alone both. Since the end of the Shanghai chaos</p>
<p>After that, all the weak and small shops are trying to reduce wages, lay off personnel, cut expenses and save food. Everything can be done freely. That is, the owed customer accounts are either reduced interest or extended. There is also a lot of room for negotiation. Those who live on wages have also had their incomes greatly reduced or even no income due to wage cuts and layoffs. Their lives are empty of savings and they live on borrowing and pawn. Only for the rent is there no room for negotiation. Because the landlord's means of increasing profits such as rent increases and relocation during the prosperous period of commerce have never been automatic for rent reduction and exemption in the autumn of commercial depression. Occasionally, the requests are rarely reduced, and only 50% to 10% are reduced. It has never been doubled or increased by several layers like a rent increase. In addition, there are also digging fees, small rents, and opening fees during the lease. At ordinary times, the tenant can still barely cope with it. At this time, the tenant is exhausted. There are no regulations in the law that can be requested for rent reduction and exemption, and there are equal clauses that the landlord can request for rent increase. If there is, the judges can make judgments based on the facts and legal principles and based on their free will, so that the tenants with weak economic capacity can have the hope of getting out of the rut and not let the market plummet and both the landlords and tenants suffer. The association is most concerned about the reality of society. If the rent is not appropriately adjusted according to the law, the commercial function will be undermined first. Its disaster is really unimaginable. Therefore, we specially submit to your court to deal with the rent case with consideration and reason, so as to provide relief for public interests. Not only will the tenants be blessed, but the landlords will also have hope for the restoration of the market. Today's superficial losses can be used as a long-term plan for the future. I hope you will consider the situation. The citizens are very fortunate. The real interests of all Shanghai merchants and residents depend on it.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Telegram from the Anti-Opium Society Regarding Rumors of Opium Monopoly in Jiangsu, <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Urging Gu Zhutong Not to Waver on the Wrong Path</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, due to the widespread rumors circulating recently about Jiangsu Province planning to implement an opium monopoly, sent a letter yesterday to Gu Zhutong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, to inquire about the truth of the matter and offer earnest encouragement. Excerpts from the original letter are as follows: (Above omitted) Rumors have been rampant lately, all alleging that your province of Jiangsu is about to implement an opium monopoly, with Lu, the manager of Xinghua Bank, in negotiations to handle the procedures related to customs revenue sources and that realization is imminent. The Society was initially reluctant to believe this, given your distinguished service to the Party and the nation, which surely would preclude your intent to lead the people into ruin. After extensive inquiries, however, we cannot help but suspect the veracity of these rumors. While street gossip can be dismissed as unfounded, there is enough evidence to warrant further investigation. According to the Society's findings, opium seedlings stretch as far as the eye can see in the Huaiyang region of northern Jiangsu, and raw opium is abundant in Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou and other places. Notorious opium traffickers, opium addicts, and proponents of the monopoly have been scurrying between Zhenjiang and Shanghai, frequenting the doors of officials in Jiangsu Province. Mr. Xu's undertaking is not without cause. It is said that the previous mass resignation of the entire committee of your provincial government was also due to the failure to implement the monopoly plan. Our Society, entrusted by the people of the nation with the duty of combating drugs, is deeply disheartened by the Jiangsu provincial government's wavering on the path of drug prohibition. Opium is a scourge that will not only harm the Party and the nation, but also poison the people, a crime that can never be washed away. Chairman Gu, with your wisdom and superior intelligence, will certainly not be misled by flatterers and tarnish your good name for posterity. It is hoped that you will immediately straighten things out, eliminate the demonic influences, strictly enforce the prohibition of opium, and set an example for officials and the people. We earnestly hope that Chairman Gu will truly consider this and we await your clear instructions with great trepidation. Thus and so.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Four Important Cases in Shanghai's Shipping Industry <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association and the Pilots' Association held joint executive and supervisory committee meetings yesterday and resolved four important cases related to the shipping industry, which are of great significance and require urgent investigation and reporting as follows:</p>
<p>Recovering Pilotage Rights: Our country's pilotage rights have long been in the hands of foreigners. Last year, the Shanghai shipping industry petitioned the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of the Navy, requesting their recovery. However, the outbreak of war led to a de facto suspension of this effort. Yesterday, the executive and supervisory committees of the Pilots' Association held a meeting and noted that if pilotage rights had been recovered last year, the Japanese troops would not have been able to sneak into Liuhang during the January 28th Incident, and Japanese warships would not have been able to freely enter and exit the Huangpu River. From a national defense perspective, it is even more necessary to actively recover pilotage rights. Four measures for recovery were discussed and decided upon: (1) Request the Ministry of Communications to immediately recover all pilotage rights and terminate the contracts of foreign pilots. (2) If there are any vacancies or an increase in the number of pilots in the future, the Pilots' Association should use Chinese pilots as much as possible. (3) In the future, Chinese representatives should be included in any consultations on pilotage issues by the Pilots' Association. (4) The case of the five additional Chinese pilots promised by the customs authorities last year should be implemented immediately. This resolution will be submitted to the Ministry of Communications immediately for vigorous advocacy.</p>
<p>Establishing a Merchant School: The expenses of the Wusong Merchant Marine School were originally shared by various shipping merchants, with tonnage surcharges levied on all vessels to cover the school's costs. The personnel trained by the school were intended for use by Chinese ships. Now, the Shipping Association has decided that the school's expenses should be borne by the central government, and the surcharges levied on each vessel should be abolished. In the future, shipping merchants will raise their own funds to establish a merchant school, and the resulting maritime talent will be even more confidential.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the funding for the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau should also be allocated by the central government, so that Shanghai shipping merchants are no longer burdened. A request will be submitted to the Ministry immediately.</p>
<p>Expediting the Issuance of Shipping Bonds: Ten million yuan in shipping bonds were approved by the central government long ago, but have not yet been issued. This year's war has resulted in losses for 43 Shanghai shipping companies, amounting to more than 4.7 million yuan. With the shipping industry now in decline, the central government is requested to issue the ten million yuan in bonds as soon as possible to provide subsidies and prevent bankruptcies.</p>
<p>Adding Passenger Manifests: After taking office, He Hanlan, the Director of the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau, sent a letter to all shipping companies, instructing them to add passenger manifests to all Jianghai vessels, as is done on foreign mail ships, to facilitate inspection. At the time, the Shipping Association held a meeting to discuss the matter. It was argued that Chinese ships operate mostly on short routes, and passengers are scattered, making it difficult to register them one by one. A request was made for exemption. Now, the Shipping Administration Bureau has sent two more letters urging compliance, ordering all shipping companies to add passenger manifests for first and second class passengers without fail. The Shipping Association has already instructed all shipping companies to comply.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a case regarding limiting the number of poor people allowed to board ships. It has been decided that the authorities should first crack down on this, and then the number of passengers allowed on each ship should be re-specified, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Reasons for the Extremely Hot Weather in Shanghai <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Yangtze River Area is Not Expected to Experience Floods This Year</p>
<p>A Discussion with Father Dragon of the Xujiahui Observatory</p>
<p>The recent hot weather in Shanghai, with temperatures reaching levels not seen in recent years, prompted the East China News Agency to visit Father Dragon, Director of the Xujiahui Catholic Church Observatory, yesterday. According to Father Dragon, the hot weather in Shanghai is due to tropical temperatures along Indochina and Annam, from where heat waves are continuously transported northeastward. This causes Shanghai to experience frequent hot southwest winds. In addition, there have been no typhoons lately, so the transportation of heat waves has not changed direction due to them, making Shanghai's climate increasingly hot. The absence of thunderstorms since the beginning of summer has made the evenings particularly hot. In the equatorial regions, however, there are large thunderstorms every day from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, so the nights are quite cool, in stark contrast to Shanghai's situation. Last year, the Yangtze River basin experienced an unprecedented flood due to excessive rainfall. This year, however, the Yangtze River basin has had very little rainfall, while North China, including Beiping and Shandong, has had fairly average rainfall. The situation is very good, and the Yangtze River basin is not expected to experience floods again this year, it is said.</p>

<p>Qian Guanjin's Young Son Kidnapped</p>
<p>Thugs Threaten with Guns</p>
<p>Qian Guanjin, a 38-year-old local gardener, lives at No. 7, Lane 206, Rue Pére Robert, in the French Concession. He has two sons and three daughters. Last night, around 8:30 PM, the whole family was cooling off at the entrance of their home when four men approached. Two of them were wearing white shirts and pants, and two were wearing hats and riding bicycles. Upon arriving at the entrance, two of the men got off the bicycles and asked if Guanjin was home. Before Qian could answer, the thugs grabbed Qian's seven-year-old second son, named Miaofu, and carried him away. Seeing the situation, Qian cried out for help, but the thugs pulled out guns and threatened him. The thugs then loaded Miaofu onto a rickshaw and fled. One of the bicycles was left at the intersection of Avenue Albert. The number on the bicycle, 18749, was already blurred. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the French Concession Police, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Fortune Teller Arrested <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Murderer is Fan Hongsheng</p>
<p>The Police are Conducting a Strict Investigation</p>
<p>After the murder of female fortune teller Yang Wenying, fortune teller Cheng Meixian (age 48, from Hangzhou), who goes by the name "Diaoyuke," was suspected of involvement and was arrested by Chief Detective You A'gen and Su Changsheng of the Laoza Police Station in Room 225 of the New World Hotel. This morning, Cheng was brought before Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court for a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated the facts of the case, saying that in addition to Yang Wenying's murder, her mother, Wang Wushi, also sustained three knife wounds, two on her arms and one on her chest. According to the doctor, her injuries were not serious. The arrest of the defendant was based on Wang Wushi's testimony. The police investigation revealed that the actual murderer was someone else, but the suspect knew the deceased through the defendant's introduction. The police are currently conducting a strict investigation of the murderer and will soon bring him to justice. The court was asked to approve the defendant's detention for one week, and a photograph of Diaoyuke and the deceased together, as well as the witnesses' statements, were presented as evidence. Detective Su testified that after the incident, the deceased's family's servant came to report it. He then went to investigate and found the deceased dead in the courtyard inside the door, with her back to the sky. He then sent the deceased and Wang Wushi to Renji Hospital. Wang Wushi stated that the defendant was involved in the incident, so he first went to 4 Weixin Lane, Rue Mabile, to arrest him, but he was not there. He then went to the New World Hotel and arrested him, explaining the various relationships between the defendant and the deceased (details already reported in the newspaper and omitted here). Cheng Meixian testified that the deceased was sold into prostitution by her mother, Wang Wushi, when she was 13 years old. He redeemed her for 140 yuan and taught her fortune telling. He recently learned that Wenying had become addicted to opium, and he tried to dissuade her, but she pretended to comply and became even more addicted to opium. He really knew nothing about her murder, and Wang Wushi hates him because he did not supervise her strictly enough, causing her daughter to develop this addiction. Now she is falsely accusing him, he said. Judge Feng, after examining the testimony, ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and scheduled another hearing in one week. The body of Yang Wenying, also known as Wang Wenying, was sent by the police to the autopsy room on Avenue Frelun. At around 10:00 AM, Inspector Zhan Liangce of the First Special District Court arrived to examine the body and ruled that the deceased, Wang Wenying, had indeed been stabbed to death with a knife, causing excessive bleeding. The defendant, Fan Hongsheng, is highly suspected of involvement and the police were instructed to conduct a strict investigation and bring him to court for questioning. Chen A'jin, the female servant, testified that a guest named Fan Hongsheng, wearing a suit, came on the day of the incident. She knew him before. He wanted to go to Lao Si's place with the young lady, but the young lady refused. The old lady was also in the room. While they were talking, Fan gave me two small coins and told me to buy cigarettes, but the coins were made of lead. When I returned, I saw that both the lady and the young lady had been stabbed and were bleeding profusely. Fan was gone, she said. Rickshaw driver Pan Changfu testified that he saw the old lady run out of the door, bleeding like beads, and then collapse. He then reported it to the local police, who chased the suspect. He saw a man in a suit running wildly in front, chasing him to Daqing Lane, where he lost sight of him. He then reported it to the police, it is said. Inspector Zhan, after examining the testimony, ruled that the deceased, Wang Wenying, had indeed been stabbed to death with a knife, causing excessive bleeding. The defendant, Fan Hongsheng, is highly suspected of involvement and the police were instructed to conduct a strict investigation and bring him to court for questioning. The lead coin was kept in the evidence vault, and the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for coffining and burial.</p>

<p>The Shanghai District Court Procuratorate was reorganized from the former Local Procuratorate. Its administrative scope was reduced and it was subordinated to the President of the Court. The Chief Prosecutor was responsible for the distribution of duties and services within the Procuratorate. Only in terms of financial matters did the President have no power.

<h3 id="e170">Yichang Ship Captain Missing <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The captain of the Yichang steamship of the American-owned Jiujiang Company suddenly went missing in Hankou. Yesterday, the company received a report that the captain was still missing. The search situation is reported as follows: The Yichang captain, Mr. Michelo J. Miclo, an American citizen, has been working for many years and is quite familiar with the Yangtze River. He left Shanghai for Chongqing on the 15th of this month and arrived in Hankou. At 3:10 PM, he was still on duty on the ship. At 3:30 PM, the ship had already left Hankou when the captain suddenly went missing. The crew searched everywhere but could not find him. They then reported it to the American gunboat on the Yangtze River for assistance. The American gunboat received the report and searched along the Yangtze River, both on land and water, but found no trace of him, nor was his body found. The deputy captain took over the Yichang, and before reaching Yichang, he prohibited all crew members, sailors, and passengers from leaving the ship, suspecting that someone on board had murdered the captain. When the crew and passengers disembarked, they were thoroughly searched and questioned one by one, but no suspicious person was found. The matter has become a mystery. After receiving the report, the Shanghai head office, considering the importance of navigation, sent a Westerner named Ao Yimeng as acting captain of the ship. They telegraphed the Hankou branch yesterday, ordering Mr. Wu to go to Yichang from Hankou to take over. They also notified Michelo's family and instructed all Jiang vessels to pay attention to the investigation. The Jiujiang Company had one cook and four passengers kidnapped by bandits in Chenlingji last month. Three people died and one went missing. The case is still unresolved. Unexpectedly, the strange incident of the captain's disappearance has now occurred.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Eighth Cholera Report from the Port Quarantine Office <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Cholera Mortality Rate Slightly Increased, Locally Produced Injectable Solution Most Effective, Guowenshe reports: Wu Liande, Director of the Port Quarantine Administration, issued the eighth cholera report yesterday, saying: (1) The weather has been unusually hot since the end of last week (July 16). The highest temperature on July 14 was 101.1 degrees (in the shade), the lowest was 75.6 degrees, and the average for the whole week was 87.8 degrees. However, the highest temperature under the sun reached 130 to 150 degrees. The highest humidity on July 11 was 95 degrees, the lowest humidity on July 12 was 48 degrees, and the average was 79.6 degrees. (2) The number of cholera cases seems to be slightly increasing this week, with a total of 318 cases and 16 deaths. The table is listed as follows:</p>
<p>District Cases Deaths Shanghai 83 4 Public Concession 141 (4 foreigners and overseas Chinese) 9 (1 foreigner and overseas Chinese) French Concession 46 0 Unknown Area 48 3 Total This Week 318 (4 foreigners and overseas Chinese) 16 (1 foreigner and overseas Chinese)</p>
<p>Total Previously 1337 (20 foreigners and overseas Chinese) 81 (7 foreigners and overseas Chinese) Total to the end of last week 1655 cases (24 foreigners and overseas Chinese) 98 deaths (8 foreigners and overseas Chinese) (3) The general public has a deep understanding of the benefits of cholera prevention injections, but there are still those who have not carefully used qualified injectable solutions. Often, products imported from Europe, America, and Japan are used. It should be known that using injectable solutions made from local strains is the most effective. For example, the injectable solutions produced by the Shanghai Public Concession Works Department and the Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratory are the best. There have been several cases of patients who still developed cholera after being injected with imported injectable solutions. (4) The benefits of early saline injection treatment (cholera initially causes sudden and rapid vomiting and diarrhea, which can excessively deplete the body's water, leading to general emaciation and cholera toxin poisoning, eventually leading to heart failure). Early treatment can neutralize toxins in the body, replenish water in the blood, and use saline to clear residual toxins from the intestines, thereby restoring heart function. There have been many cases of severely ill patients whose pulse lines were completely lost and turned bluish upon admission, who were able to talk and laugh freely after only half an hour of treatment. Therefore, the low mortality rate in Shanghai this time (6%) must be attributed to the early prevention efforts of the health authorities, especially the effectiveness of preventive injections and early medical treatment in hospitals for the majority of citizens. (5) The efficiency of cholera prevention and control in Shanghai is as described above, but it is regrettable that other cholera-epidemic provinces and regions in the country have not achieved the same efficiency. Cholera outbreaks have been found in Suzhou, Wuxi, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Shantou, Suiyuan, Zhuozhou (between Beiping and Baoding), Nanchang (Jiangxi), and Baotou, with mortality rates of 4% to 50%. (6) Although the Japanese government has made great efforts to prevent and control cholera in Dalian, there have already been 20 cases, and there is deep concern about the spread of the epidemic to Liaoning, Jilin, Harbin, and the Northeast region. (7) According to the report from Director Wang of the Xiamen Port Quarantine Station, the newly built hospital has been able to accommodate a large number of cholera patients in the past two weeks. However, due to the narrowness of the hospital, straw sheds have been added to accommodate the large number of patients. The Xiamen Port Quarantine Hospital is the only hospital in the city that admits and treats cholera patients. (8) Many places have manufactured a large number of cholera prevention solutions, such as the Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratory, the Public Concession Works Department Chemical Laboratory, the Central Health Laboratory (Nanjing), the Central Epidemic Prevention Office (Beiping), the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Office (Harbin), and the South Manchuria Railway Health Laboratory (Dalian). The prices of these solutions are very low.</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Red Light at the Wusong Fort Lighthouse was Lit Yesterday <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Installed to indicate the sea routes to the outside of the estuary. During the Sino-Japanese War, the signal light tower at the Wusong Fort, set up by the Jianghai Customs to guide ships, was destroyed by artillery shells, causing the red light at the top of the tower to go out. Afterwards, the Japanese army tried to repair the lighthouse and relit it. However, a red light on the pier in front of the flagpole room was also destroyed. This light is very important because it is used to indicate the sea routes outside the estuary. The Jianghai Customs engineer ordered craftsmen to repair it in Song and changed the light to use dry electricity (previously kerosene). The light flashes on and off, and there is no need for a lamplighter. It can automatically light up and shine day and night. It only needs to be recharged once every three months, which is very convenient. The installation has been completed, and it started burning yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Joint Meeting of the Fire Brigades in the Northern District of Shanghai <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Discussing Ways to Cope with Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>The funds for the fire brigades in the northern districts of Shanghai have been collected from the local general donations by the municipal government and transferred to the Public Security Bureau for monthly allocation. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the municipal treasury has been depleted, and each district has only received 60 yuan for maintenance. All the repair budgets and recurring expenses for the fire-fighting equipment damaged during the war, such as vehicles and leather belts, have been submitted and requested for allocation for relief repeatedly, but more than two months have passed without any news. A major fire occurred on Haichang Road a few days ago, burning more than 100 houses. The firefighters were unable to rescue the fire due to the lack of leather belts and the vehicles and important equipment were not yet repaired. If it were not for the neighboring and Nanshi Concession fire brigades to help extinguish the fire, the danger would have been unimaginable. The brigade and others now consider the local fire protection matters to be of great importance to the safety and security of the residents. No matter how difficult the municipal government's finances are, it should be given some consideration to maintain the safety of citizens' property and lives. It is said that a joint meeting will be convened at the First Section Fire Brigade at 5:00 PM today to discuss the problem of the delayed disbursement of fire protection funds in detail in order to find relief measures.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Continued Investigation of Relevant Persons in the Liu Nianchun Kidnapping Case <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Liu Personally Came to Court to Testify</p>
<p>Describing the Kidnapping Process</p>
<p>Liu Nianchun, a native of Suzhou, is the manager of the Dingkang Gold Store on Tianjin Road. He lives at No. 922 North Chengdu Road. On the afternoon of July 5th of the previous year, at around 6:00 PM, he and his wife, Ms. Ma, were in their own car in front of their house, going somewhere, when he was kidnapped by bandits. His wife managed to pay a ransom of 20,000 yuan. On August 13th of that year, the Xinzha Police Station arrested the leader of the kidnappers, Yu Baocheng, and sent him to court for questioning. He was sentenced to death and has already been executed. On the 5th of this month, Sun Shaokun, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, learned that two drivers, Shao A'gen, who worked as drivers at the Lili Car Shop at No. 17 Suzhou Road, were involved in the case. He then coordinated with Western detectives to secretly go to their home (No. 325, Oujia Road) to arrest him and sent him to the First Special District Court for questioning. Yesterday, Judge Shen Bingrong held a continued hearing in the Fourth Criminal Court, and police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the victim Liu Nianchun had come to court today and requested to ask questions, adding that the investigation revealed that the defendant was working as a driver for a lawyer surnamed Zhang at the time, and fled to Dalian after the incident, it is said. Then, according to Liu Nianchun's testimony, he and his wife had just boarded their own car parked at the entrance of the alley, and before the car door was closed, four bandits suddenly rushed into the car. Two bandits sat in front, scaring the driver Lu Lanfu into silence. The other two bandits sat next to him and drove quickly to Hongzhen, where they drove his wife and driver out of the car and the bandits who sat in the front were not able to be seen clearly. The two bandits who were guarding him had Jiangbei accents. The car went to a place, and the four bandits got out one after another. There were several other bandits who kidnapped him to a remote field and made him walk around. He was dizzy and exhausted. Later, he was taken to a small room with no windows, only a hole in the roof for light. Three bandits guarded him. Every night at 8:00 or 9:00 PM, two bandits came, wearing foreign hats that hung down and black glasses on their noses, about thirty years old, speaking the local dialect of Ningbo, and repeatedly threatened him. He ignored them. The three bandits who were guarding him looked like Shanghai locals. His wife paid 20,000 yuan to release him. He lived in the house for nine days, and the defendant was arrested. He was not one of the two who were sitting next to him in the car at the time. But he did not know whether the driver was there and could not specify. After this unfortunate incident, he cancelled the car, so the driver Lu had already resigned and he did not know where he was now. He did not think he had left Shanghai. If he knew, he might be willing to come to court to testify, he said. The defendant insisted that he did not know anything about Liu's kidnapping. He was working for a lawyer surnamed Zhang for about two weeks, and then resigned because the car was transferred. Later, he received a letter from his father in Dalian about a gramophone and went to Dalian on August 12th, staying for about three months. The court asked if the previous arrested criminal said that he went with him to rob land, and he answered no, and said that if it was confirmed that he was one of the kidnappers in Liu's case, he would be willing to be shot. Judge Shen, after examining the testimony, ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<p>Ni Yougeng, the Director of the Typecasting Department of the Zhonghua Bookstore in Jing'an Temple Road, lives at No. 96 Hejia Lane, Shangwen Road, in this city. Because he dismissed two workers, Tao Shunbao and Xu Yunzhou, for poor performance, Tao and others ganged up with Han Liuxiu, Liu Wenqing, Gao Haosheng, Li Qili, and others, who were also workers in the same factory, on the morning of the 18th. They attacked Ni Yougeng when he got off the bus at Avenue Foch and Avenue Hartung, stabbing him in the legs and hitting him in the lower back with knives. He was taken to the Red Cross Hospital on Rue Haig by the driver for treatment, and the Jing'an Temple Police arrested Tao and others and sent them to the First Special District Court for questioning and custody. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Ni also suffered internal injuries, so yesterday afternoon, after consulting with the hospital, Ni was sent back to his home at No. 96 Heyou Lane by ambulance for treatment. After arriving home, Shi Xiaoshan, a trauma specialist, was immediately called for diagnosis. It is said that the internal injuries are not minor and it may be difficult to recover in a short time.</p>

<p>Ministry of Industry to Send Personnel to Shanghai Again to Negotiate</p>
<p>Specializing in Industrial Investment, Not Issuing Banknotes</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry plans to establish a China Construction Bank, which is currently under preparation. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from local industrialists yesterday that the bank is expected to be established around New Year's Day next year. However, commercial shares have not yet been fully sold, so they are still being promoted. Industrialists said that the government shares of 4 million are no problem, but the commercial shares may not be fully subscribed for the time being. In the future, after the bank is established, it will specialize in industries such as coal mines and forests to promote industrial development, and will never engage in market speculation. The share capital of 10 million cannot be considered substantial, so after business develops, the share capital will need to be actively expanded. It has now been decided not to issue banknotes. Guo Chuntao, Vice Minister of Industry, plans to come to Shanghai again to negotiate with the Shanghai business community.</p>

<p>Huang Guansheng Robbed of a Large Sum</p>
<p>Police Officers Immediately Solve the Case</p>
<p>Yesterday (20th) morning, around 3:20 AM, at No. 14 Sunjia Bridge, Jun Gong Road, north of Shanghai, the home of Huang Guansheng, a local bailiff, was suddenly visited by eight robbers. Two of the robbers, each holding real and fake pistols, immediately intimidated the victims and ordered them to remain silent and monitored their movements. Four robbers entered the house and searched for more than one hundred pieces of new silk and leather clothing, two gold rings, one gold bracelet, and one gold ear pick, worth more than 1,000 yuan. They packed the items into four bundles and carried them away. The victim immediately reported the incident to the Fifth District, Fourth Precinct (i.e., Yinxianggang Town), which notified all police stations to investigate. The Precinct Chief Liao Cheng-zhang and officer Wu Lin-zhi immediately led the police to the victim's home to investigate the scene.</p>
<p>For a week, they were split up and assigned to rigorously investigate in the countryside.  The officers from the Jiangjiaxing Precinct Zhao Zhibin and Hu Wanshun were conducting routine patrol on the road when they spotted two suspects in the act of carrying large bundles. They were stopped to inquire the contents of the bundles. They blankly stared and could not answer. They only claimed that a friend from Wusong entrusted me to carry it to Caojiadu in western Shanghai. They were immediately taken to the precinct for interrogation. They were identified as accomplices in the robbery of Huang Guansheng's home. One of them was identified as Xia Jinlong and the other Yan Chengquan. The two were taken back to the Fourth Precinct along with the loot.  Under close interrogation by Chief Liao, it was revealed that the rest of the loot was taken to Caojiadu by accomplices to divide the spoils.  The firearms were located at Xia Jinquan's residence. Chief Liao immediately dispatched patrol officer He Shaoxiang and others who rushed through the night</p>
<p>went to Caojiadu and together with two police officers from the Sixth Precinct patrol for the arrest.  On an open space in that location, the patrol located 5 or 6 thieves sitting on the ground and dividing the spoils.  The patrolmen immediately rushed forward and arrested the thieves.  The patrol immediately arrested Wang Aqhi and Li Qianlou. The remaining suspects managed to escape.  Within those who escaped, the suspect Li was captured by the patrolman Wu Aile for being red-shirted without a waist belt.  The arrest happened to be near a river which suspect jumped into for escape. Patrolman Wu Aile and Wang Keyi followed the chase. They gave chase and jumped into the river. The suspect was captured four times. The two patrolmen were tenacious and finally subdued the suspect.  The two patrolmen fired over ten shots at the sky. Patrolman Wu's legs were severely wounded from jumping into the river.  The loot were brought back to the Fourth Precinct for questioning. It was found that there was more loot hidden at a residence of a certain person on Carter Road (卡德路). The patrol were dispatched along with detectives to haul the loot from the residence. It was found that after inspection from Huang Guansheng that 200 yuan worth of goods was missing. Chief Liao Cheng-zhang stated that the case was solved in less than an hour. The patrol and officers made a valiant pursuit and patrolman Wu was injured. He immediately awarded the patrolmen 20 yuan for their efforts. The case along with the suspects and loot were submitted to the City Police Department for inquiry.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I recently read a news item in the second column of your newspaper's local news section, entitled "(Dying at Home Instead of in Prison)," which stated that inmate Chen Changsheng was due to be released on the 17th of this month upon payment of the fine by his family. It was hoped that he would be released on that day, but it was not until yesterday (the 19th) that the release order was received from the province. The tone of the article suggests that this prison detained the prisoner for two extra days, which is not in accordance with the facts. After checking, inmate Chen Changsheng, who has been released, was sentenced by the Second Special District Court for opium-related crimes to one month of imprisonment and a fine of</p>
<p>30 yuan. He was sent to prison on June 28th of this year. After carefully examining the execution order sent to the prison by the court, it was noted that the starting date of his sentence was June 25th, with six days deducted, and the term expired on July 18th. After the expiration of the term, he was sent to the court for execution of the fine. According to Article 22 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Law, this prison sent him to the court on July 19th in the forenoon in accordance with the law. This prison has records to prove it. Therefore, I am writing to request that your newspaper publish the original letter in the newspaper to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Shanghai Second Special District Prison, Jiangsu, July 20th.</p>
<p>On the 17th of this month, the Pacific Shipping Company's poor operations and the merging of the Taizi and Baohe ships, as reported in your newspaper's local news section, are not true. The Taizi ships are actually merged into E-Tai Company. The reason for the merger is not due to the poor operation of the Taizi ships. The Taizi ships will continue to operate to Shanghai and the ports of New York and Manila, alternating with E-Tai's Snow ships. Therefore, both shipping companies are merged and managed by E-Tai. It has nothing to do with Baohe. We hereby inform you and hope for a correction. E-Tai Shipping Company, July 21.</p>

<h3 id="e196">From Taels and Yuan to Silver and Paper <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>During times of great national turmoil, especially after the devastating January 28th Incident, the domestic industry has been in extreme decline. Farmers' economies are on the verge of bankruptcy. The essence of the country is concentrated in cities, which rely on the clothing and food necessary for life.</p>
<p>The people exhausted their possessions to trade for imported cloth and rice. Thus, the silver dollars and banknotes that once penetrated the interior flowed into the cities within half a year. To cope with import trade, there was a need for real silver, leading to a drastic drop in the ocean tael price to around 68 cents, an unprecedented situation. Under these extraordinary circumstances, the old idea of abolishing taels and adopting yuan has been revived. It is hoped that eloquent articles and great arguments will appear in newspapers, advocating that the time is ripe and it is a pity to miss it. More radical proponents are impatiently urging its completion, demanding the government swiftly enact it with a decree, believing that the currency system can be unified once silver taels are abolished. Those who oppose it argue that attempting such a fundamental change during a time of post-war chaos and abnormal finance may have other motives. They suspect the intention is to promote the issuance of paper money after the abolition of real silver taels, and even claim that the plummeting ocean tael price is not due to the overabundance of silver dollars but the abundance of paper money. According to actual surveys, the currency concentrated in Shanghai consists of no more than two or three parts silver dollars and seven or eight parts paper money. Furthermore, they criticize the previous government for recklessly permitting numerous official and private banks to have the right to issue banknotes. Over the past twenty years, the people have suffered from paper money, such as the Jitie banknotes in the three northeastern provinces, and the non-convertible banknotes of banks in Zhili, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, and the Northwest provinces. The discounts on Chuan Taels and Hankou notes in Tianjin are recent lessons. They suspect whether the reserves of various issuing banks are genuine and comply with the law, as the government does not supervise and society does not care, allowing them to operate freely without restrictions, hiding dangers and creating risks. If an outbreak occurs, it will inevitably spread throughout the country. In this period, suddenly advocating the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan is like adding fuel to the fire and pushing the boat in dangerous direction. European countries have complete currency systems, with both standard</p>
<p>and auxiliary currencies, and the right to issue money is controlled by the government. However, people still cannot avoid the disasters of paper money, such as the Russian ruble and the German mark, as everyone knows. Even recently, when Britain announced the suspension of convertibility and Japan banned the export of gold, prices plummeted. Isn't this all because countries over-issued paper money? Our country's currency system is complex and chaotic, the financial system is disorganized, and the issuance is not unified. If we rashly abolish taels and adopt yuan, it may cause widespread repercussions and inevitably trigger other disturbances, leading to social unrest. His words are like this, but I believe that abolishing taels and adopting yuan is only a partial issue in currency system reform, and it is not a purely political issue. It is indeed related to social economy, market conditions, and finance. The government must be able to carefully assess the timing, coordinate overall, and consider carefully. Silver taels are certainly on the list of things that must be abolished, and not suspended due to the opposition of a few. Regarding the disorganized issuance, proper plans must be made to learn from the past and prevent future troubles. Then, after silver taels are abolished, the financial system will be stable and the country and people will truly benefit from it.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Feng Bingnan Questions Ma Yinchu on the Issue of Abolishing Taels and Adopting Yuan <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the sharp drop in the price of the ocean tael, the idea of abolishing taels and adopting yuan has arisen at the right time. The government is in favor of it, scholars are advocating it, and those in the financial community are also providing detailed analysis and expressing their views. This issue has become the center of public opinion. Although there are those who hold opposing views, they mostly express agreement with the principle of abolishing taels and adopting yuan. Those who are concerned and believe that caution is needed only differ on the steps to be taken. In my humble opinion, although the advocacy of abolishing taels and adopting yuan seems to be gradually converging, it would be too assertive to say that the principle can be debated without any argument. There are many examples in the world where something has been advocated by hundreds or thousands of people for a long time, but once it is implemented, it is constrained by the situation, and its drawbacks are immediately apparent before its benefits are seen. How many of the reforms in our country in the past have achieved the expected results? Often, the opposite is true. The use of taels has a long history, and what is old has become a habit, which cannot be changed suddenly. After the introduction of silver dollars, because they were named after foreigners, they were not a system owned by the country. Since taels can be merged into yuan, why can't yuan be abolished and taels retained? The effects are similar. Therefore, there is room for research on which of the two to choose. However, this is beyond the scope of this article and will be omitted for now. What I want to discuss here is Mr. Ma Yinchu's recent article on abolishing taels and adopting yuan. Mr. Ma speaks painfully about the chaos of our country's currency system, and especially believes that the diverse composition of silver taels and the local division are obstacles to the unification of the national currency. Therefore, he wants to catch the king and destroy the yuan to realize his silver dollar standard. His momentum is strong and his words are harsh. However, he also says that there are many types of silver dollars in our country, and the composition varies in quality. He is also dissatisfied with silver dollars like we are. The only difference is that Mr. Ma believes that since the market price of the ocean tael has repeatedly fallen, silver dollars with higher quality have been melted down, and those that have not been melted down are mostly inferior silver dollars. The composition may be unified, which is of great benefit to the unification of the silver dollar composition. Therefore, he believes that it is a good opportunity to abolish taels and adopt yuan. He also says that "(The money shops say that abolishing taels and adopting yuan must be done after the unification of hard and soft currencies. This is really illogical. Who can draw this conclusion on what comes first and what comes later? It seems too boring for the money shops to say this. The purpose of abolishing silver and using yuan today is to unify hard currency. There is absolutely no reason why hard currency can be unified without abolishing silver taels.)" However, we believe that since we want to abolish taels, the shortcomings of taels seem to be of no use to attack, and the harms of yuan cannot but be eliminated first. Otherwise, although taels are abolished, the harm to the people will be more severe than when taels and yuan are used together. Let's set an example to clarify this. Suppose there are two parties, A and B, who share the power of government. They are constantly fighting for the country, and the people are suffering. Once the people want to overthrow Party A to support Party B to take sole power, hoping to benefit the country, then the minimum requirement must be to first check whether Party B's policies are necessary for the times, and whether the words and deeds of its members are trusted by the people. Only after a satisfactory check can they be entrusted with major policies, hoping that the subsequent effects will not be that Party A's policies are bad and its members are not popular, and then strongly claim that Party B's policies must be good and its members must be good, and once they take sole power, they will definitely benefit the country and the people. This analogy cannot be said to be illogical. The fact that the composition of silver dollars today is uneven and that paper money floods the market has been recognized. If we do not start by reorganizing hard currencies, but rashly abolish taels and adopt yuan, then those who independently mint coins in various provinces will be the same, and those who issue paper money from various banks will be the same. Taels will be abolished, but the currency system will still be the same. After a disturbance, there must be people who take the opportunity to profit, and the result will still be suffered by the general majority of the people. There is no doubt about this. Although the Shanghai Mint can mint 500,000 new coins a day, what good does it do to the unification of the currency system? This is why we are hesitant to agree with the idea of rashly changing the yuan without first reorganizing soft and hard currencies. Also, Mr. Ma says that paper money will not be over-issued after the yuan is changed. We cannot help but doubt it. Since it is said that it will not be over-issued, then it must be issued. If it is necessary to issue, then who can guarantee that it will not be abused? Mr. Ma says that there are 220 million silver taels and 50 million taels in Shanghai. Assuming that this number is accurate, then after the abolition of taels, Shanghai alone will need to increase paper money by 70 million yuan. In addition to the number that should be issued after the abolition of silver taels nationwide, the number must be alarming. How can it be said that it is not much? May I ask, if the soft currency has not been reorganized and the right to issue has not been unified, and then this huge amount is added out of nowhere, what will be the impact on society and people's livelihood? How can we not think deeply about it? Mr. Ma's article lists three reasons for those who oppose the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan. Except for the first one, that the government profits from it, we do not want to treat others with a distrustful heart and will not say a word. As for the other two, as discussed above, Mr. Ma says that they seem right but are actually wrong, but we believe that they seem wrong but are actually right. I dare to use the meaning of "Everyone speaks their mind" and briefly express my thoughts. I sincerely hope that people of the country will express their views and judge them so that the truth can be clarified.</p>
<p>After Mr. Ma's article lists all the good things that banks will have after the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, and the psychology of the money shops' opposition, it is thorough and should have everything. Mr. Ma may have written it in a moment of excitement, with no intention of being reasonable. However, the words are close to defamation and involve trivial matters. Rebutting this would turn against the main point, so I will not repeat it.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Gu Weijun's Talk in Jinan <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>-- Fo</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Weijun spoke to reporters at Jinan Railway Station on the 18th. The most important meanings in his conversation were these two sentences:</p>
<p>"Foreign affairs and military affairs depend on the government to preside over, and the people should assist. Recently, Japanese goods have increased,</p>
<p>how will the people of our country explain themselves?"</p>
<p>These two sentences are completely correct, but I still want to make it clear that since the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the severe oppression and destruction of the Japanese army against the Chinese people has been unprecedented in the history of our country. Now, for the Chinese to go to sell Japanese goods is truly living in a drunken dream, losing all conscience. However, this matter cannot be blamed on the general public. The worst are a few greedy merchants, while the general public is only seeking petty profits and lacks the ability to distinguish. The lack of progress of our country's people is originally unexplainable. However, the government cannot shirk its responsibility. Why has the anti-Japanese movement in Shanghai suddenly become silent?</p>
<p>If foreign affairs and military affairs must rely on the government to preside over, this is of course the case. If not the government, who else can we rely on? However, whether the government can be relied upon or not is a question. Since the September 18th Incident, slogans such as long-term resistance to recover lost territory have long been heard. However, how to recover and how to resist are still hovering in our minds and have not been dreamed of yet. Now, the Japanese army is trying to advance into Rehe, bombing Chaoyang City. The situation is very dangerous. Military officers who have always advocated non-resistance are naturally incurable. However, what should military officers who claim long-term resistance and the recovery of lost territory do?</p>
<p>As for the people's assistance, there is no need to worry about it. Just look at the people's assistance to the brave resistance against the Japanese at Zhamashan, and the people's assistance to the brave resistance against the Japanese by the 19th Route Army. This kind of assistance comes entirely from the people's initiative. From this point of view, how eager are the people's patriotic concepts? If the government can send troops to recover lost territory, the people's assistance will definitely be even more enthusiastic. Now, it is not that the people are not helping, but that they are powerless to help.</p>
<p>As for the mainland people's dissatisfaction with the central government, it is mostly due to this. If the central government once mobilized a large army and attacked directly, no matter whether it is the reactionary army or the Communist army, if there are any who take the opportunity to cause chaos and try to destroy it, our people should unanimously</p>
<p>rise up and abandon them together!</p>

<p>-- Du Fenglou</p>
<p>For no reason, a fierce war broke out, with bones piling up like mountains and blood dyeing the river. The prosperity of the old days is just an empty imagination, and the accumulated literature is left to the passing waves. Few swallows return to complete their nests, and the newly painted mourning geese have experienced many disasters. Asking the doctors of the country who worry about the times, what is the plan to relieve disasters and help the poor?</p>
<h3 id="e200">Same as Above <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>-- Xiao Chang</p>
<p>Sons defend the country with weapons, when the lone army went to the Black River. How can we seek peace and greed for half of the country, and still please the enemy with subtle waves? I hate hearing few voices of aid during the war, and I often hear laughter after peace. I have not wrapped my body in horse leather on the battlefield, how can I sing sad songs with enthusiasm?</p>

<h3 id="e201">Artificial Marble <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Xiqin</p>
<p>Marble is widely used in architecture and crafts, its value comparable to that of a city. However, its production is limited by geographical and other factors, unlike granite, which can be easily extracted anywhere without fear of depletion.</p>
<p>Let's not discuss foreign countries for the moment. Within China, the areas rich in marble are limited to Dali in Yunnan and Qiyang in Hunan. However, both are located deep inland, making it difficult to continuously supply the needs of large coastal commercial and industrial cities. In this respect, promoting the modernization of our lives faces a dilemma in its path of development: one is to strive for scientific production, and the other is to beg for the surplus of friendly nations with huge sums of money.</p>
<p>Artificial marble is a kind of successful experiment in which we use scientific methods to make something similar to natural marble. If you have the right tools and fine techniques, and follow the sequence below, the results will often bring well-deserved comfort to the brave men and women dedicated to the craft.</p>
<p>(1) Materials (A) Pure white cement is sold in Shanghai, mostly imported, and more than twice as expensive as ordinary cement used for reinforced concrete. In fact, there is little difference between the method of making this cement and ordinary cement, but pure limestone (such as calcite) and pure aluminum silicate (such as kaolin) must be selected as raw materials. When mixing and pulverizing them, avoid direct friction with ironware (replace with hard stone or pottery) to prevent iron filings from mixing in and destroying its whiteness. (B) Crystalline quartz fragments with edges, screened through two sieves with different mesh sizes, and the middle layer of uniform volume is taken for use. (C) Finely ground metal oxide pigments, dissolved in water, and organic pigments that fade over time are not suitable.</p>
<p>Same hot weather, different ways to cool off. Lushan bean sheds, each with its own charm. Buddhist inscription</p>
<p>For pink, take one part of ammonium-precipitated stannic chloride, one part of zinc oxide, and one part of aluminum oxide, mix evenly and calcine in a refractory clay crucible.</p>
<p>For sky blue, calcine 0.05 parts of cobalt oxide, 2 parts of aluminum oxide, and 1.5 parts of zinc oxide.</p>
<p>For emerald green, grind evenly 0.05 parts of chromium oxide, 2 parts of zinc oxide, and 2 parts of calcined borax, put them into a crucible, and wash and grind them finely after calcination. Note: The above three pigments, with low-temperature coal flux, are suitable for painting on ceramics and glass.</p>
<p>(2) Tools (A) Shallow pans made of galvanized iron sheet, welded according to the size and shape of tabletops and screens. (B) Plaster of Paris, lithographic stone, etc. are used to cast negative molds of statues and other sculptures, i.e., seed molds. (C) Lithographic stone, rosin, tallow, turpentine. (D) Large wooden buckets for mixing cement and earthenware bowls for mixing pigments, iron pots for melting wax, stirring rods. (E) Jing Mountain stone powder for polishing (this powder is used for polishing jade and glass), foot-operated grinding wheel.</p>
<p>(3) Processing: First, let's describe the construction of artificial flat marble slabs. Take the above-made galvanized iron shallow pan, coat it with a lubricant made of molten wax, rosin, and tallow in an iron pot until dry, and place it on a platform. Then, take seven parts of the weighed white cement and three parts of crystalline quartz sand, mix them with water in a wooden bucket to form a paste, pour it into the pan, shake it flat and let it dry. After it hardens, use hot water to heat the bottom surface of the lead pan, the wax will melt, and it will easily fall off. Use Jing Mountain stone powder and water to hone it on a smooth and flat whetstone, and you will get a crystal-clear and white flat</p>
<p>marble slab.</p>
<p>If you want red veins, you should mix a bowl of pink cement slurry separately when mixing the cement (add the above-mentioned pink pigment), pour it into a large wooden bucket, and skillfully mix it into a pattern like veins and flowers, pour it into a galvanized iron pan and let it dry. The procedure for blue veins is the same, only the pigment is changed.</p>
<p>If you want emerald green landscape patterns, you can also rely on the skill of splashing ink to form a dragon, and reap the rewards of your own efforts. Regarding the surgery of making statue molds, I will discuss it in detail when I discuss wax figures and plaster crafts in another section. However, casting statues of artificial marble is also based on the above-mentioned method of preparing flat marble.</p>
<p>I have nothing more to say.</p>
<h3 id="e202">### False Alarm <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Former Master of Zhenglou</p>
<p>I have a friend named Jin, who is studying Chinese with Mr. Hu Huaichen in Jing County, he is a very honest young man. His father runs a shop in the western part of this city. After he graduated from middle school, his father would not allow him to continue his studies, and asked him to help with the shop business... But he loves literature and is eager to learn. Although he did not step into a towering university to continue his studies, he finally joined the Chinese language tutoring class set up by Mr. Hu. In addition, he is also studying at a night school. He stayed at his friend's house in Shanghai at night.</p>
<p>He usually likes to read books and magazines published in the market. Regardless of whether they are new or old, good or bad, he always buys new publications to read. Therefore, this false alarm was also a punishment for indiscriminately reading magazines without discernment! Because he recently saw a literary magazine, which contained a message that a certain literary society on Ximen Road was recruiting members. This touched his love of literature, so yesterday morning (the 19th), he came out of his friend's house where he was staying, and rode his own bicycle straight to the so-called literary society on Ximen Road to ask for a copy of the charter to read.</p>
<p>When he arrived inside, there was a person guarding it, who said to him: "Wait upstairs! I'll go get the charter." He was waiting upstairs, and in a moment, many Chinese and Western detectives came and surrounded him. The first Chinese detective asked him, "Aren't you here to die? Why do you want to join the Communist Party?" At this time, he was really like a monk of丈二, unable to figure out what was going on. It turned out that the so-called literary society was an organ of the Communist Party, which had been cracked down on the day before yesterday. At this time, the police were waiting for accomplices. Seeing him coming so early to ask for the charter, they suspected that he was a red element. Therefore, without allowing him to explain, they caught him and took him to the Songshan Road Police Station. They took out many photos and asked him, "Do you know these people?" He said, "I'm here to ask for the charter, I really don't know what's going on!" Later, a letter written to Mr. Hu Huaichen was found in his schoolbag. (Prepared to put in the mailbox) The police thought it was necessary to inquire, so they sent many detectives, accompanying him to Mr. Hu's house on Fulili Road, scaring Teacher Hu, who was living in peace and quiet in his humble home! Especially the family members. Later, after Mr. Hu proved his character and resume to the police, they all withdrew from Hu's house and took him back to the police station. The authorities warned him: "You have to be careful in the future, now go!" A false alarm ended here.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Extremely Important Rural Hygiene – Yi Ping <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>It is said that this year's weather is the hottest in eight years. One of my classmates suggested going to the countryside for a few days, but the countryside is also just as hot. However, the flavor of the oxcart shed keeps people's minds from decaying. Originally, there were people who wrote special books discussing the city and the countryside. The content also focused on the flavor of the oxcart shed, but did not pay attention to rural hygiene. Although we only stayed for three days, we noticed a very tragic thing, or rather, it is the philosophy of the countryside.</p>
<p>On the second day of arriving in the countryside, a police officer and a doctor in uniform came. They went door to door to persuade people to get vaccinations, talking all day long about how terrible cholera is in the hot summer, especially after this year's war, the epidemic is even worse. We were sent by X County to give vaccinations and do not charge a fee, but no matter how hard you try to persuade them, the farmers are as afraid of getting vaccinated as if they were in a lawsuit, and they all shake their heads and run away.</p>
<p>We two had already received the first vaccination in Shanghai, so we asked them to give us the second vaccination. The farmers whispered to each other, as if getting vaccinated was a terrible thing. The police officer and the doctor smiled and said to us, "It's good to go back and report the results." After the police officer and the doctor left, they all gathered around to warn us.</p>
<p>"They are Japanese in disguise!" An old lady said this.</p>
<p>Of course, we gave them speeches, telling them that they should pay the most attention to hygiene in summer, and even said what was taught in elementary school (do not drink unclean water, do not eat raw and cold food), etc.</p>
<p>"Those who have studied in foreign schools all believe in foreign methods. Before there were Western doctors, didn't Chinese people still live? We country people all drink cold water from the river and sleep in oxcart sheds at night, and we don't hear of people dying every day. Doctors can give vaccinations, but can doctors themselves not die?" A healthy but not beautiful farmer yelled with gestures as if scolding someone.</p>
<p>We can't blame them for their words. In their eyes, their reasons are sufficient. Therefore, rather than saying that they don't pay attention to hygiene, it is better to say that it is because education in China is not widespread. If everyone could have four or six years of compulsory education, they would know what getting vaccinations and other things are all about.</p>
