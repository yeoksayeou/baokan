<h3 id="c1">禦侮興國之先例㈠彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>在今日我民族内憂外患交相煎逼之非常嚴重時期。國人應都懷有一種深重之欵慮與焦灼不能解答之重大問題。即爲我國果可以戰勝日本乎。我民族之前途。究何若乎。此種欵慮與焦灼。誠爲不可少。且正所以顯示我民族。今尙未消失其維護生存之生命偉力。前途正極光明。今以新土耳其爲例。請國人一讀新土耳其復興史。</p>
<p>土耳其於一九一八年歐戰慘敗之後。政治上既失其重。心全國尤呈現紊亂瓦解之狀態。國家之危亡。已間不容髮。而其時鼓吹大希臘主義之希臘軍隊。乃復乘其危。大舉進攻。於一九一九年五月攻佔士麥那。土耳其當時之危殆。蓋遠超於今日之我國。於此危急存亡之秋。基瑪爾等乃崛起於東部小亞細亞。率訓練未久軍。械不足之國民軍。起而抗禦。屢戰屢北。但終盡力扼守最後之陣線。於一九二一年九月初。猛力反攻。希軍遂一敗不可收拾。是月十日。克復士麥那。雖當希軍敗退。盡力破壞。士麥那大火延燒至一星期不久。精華盡喪。苦戰三年。犧牲尤大。而新土耳其乃終在此種艱難之奮鬭與偉大之犧牲下。奠定其基石。</p>
<p>然而土耳其之復興。固非基瑪爾一人之力也。其成功之要因。第一。爲民衆之覺醒。人具國亡與亡效死勿去之决心。以其怨毒之深。信守之堅。動作之壯烈。故終能奪取最後之勝利。第二爲力量集中。舉國上下。同心同德。人皆認淸禦侮安内之新目標。犧牲一已以爲國效命。第三爲外交之運用。一面以實力抗禦强暴。一面聯絡友邦。外交既已順遂。軍實亦能充足。第四。爲應付事機之果斷。舉凡對内對外。皆當機立斷。毫不因循。以此數因。故終能打破一切艱難之險局。使新土耳其屹然自立於世界。世界人士。都不能不刮目相看。</p>
<p>吾人迴溯過往土耳其復興之史蹟。當可知因循不自振作之民族。乃有艱難。其在覺醒奮鬥之民族。則艱難恰爲成功之助力。故吾人今日。不必問當前若何艱難。但問我民族今日已否覺悟。力量已否集中。臨時是否能當機立斷。一洗因循敷衍之舊習。在外交上是否能有固定之政策。與不屈不撓之精神。而善爲運用。如其能。則最後之勝利。自在吾人掌握之中。歷史固不復演新土耳其成功之舊劇。但至少亦可作吾人奮鬥努力之先例。吾人今日。但須各多盡一分禦侮之責任。切忌内部聚訟。以自分散其勢力。吾人今日。必須有苦戰十年之準備。尤必有忍受任何鉅大損失犧牲之决心。天助自助者。最後之勝敗。終當於戰塲上决定。但須以鐵與血衝向前陣去。焦慮奚益</p>
<p>今日路透電柏林波爾森報。以此次中日戰爭。比擬英法百年戰爭。法以全力抵抗外敵。卒成爲統一國。完全恢復失土。該報之意。亦以此次中日戰爭。其勢非持久不可。囑望於我國人之能自奮能自助甚殷。我國人其勉。之</p>

<p>江灣激戰竟日敵受重創　　持志大學敵軍七百全殲　　敵司令部中彈起火延燒　　我軍擊落敵軍飛機三架</p>
<p>日軍自前日拂曉起、遣派海陸空軍、向我方全線總攻竟日、結果又遭慘敗、昨日自晨至晚、仍向我江灣及吳淞砲臺全綫繼續攻擊、我方亦全綫應戰、截至今晨二時止、敵終不得逞、且在江灣路持志大學内有日兵七百餘名、被我軍包圍、於下午五時許、完全殲滅、並於上午十一時許、在廟行鎭八字橋、擊落敵飛機兩架、下午三時許、又在劉行鎭擊落一架、閘北方面、昨日較爲靜靖、惟晚間我曾向敵軍司令部（即北四川路日本小學）開砲、被我砲擊中起火、爲勢甚烈、死傷甚多、敵軍飛機多架、昨日飛至我軍後方各處、偵察擲彈、炸燬民房甚多、民衆受傷亦不少、又二十日上午敵艦被我獅子林砲臺擊沉一艘、擊傷二艘、薀藻浜方面、被我擊傷一艘、茲將本報所得各項詳情、彙誌如後、</p>

<p>敵軍自於前晨七時二十分下總攻擊令後、主力部隊、集中江灣、吳淞閘北同時進攻、我軍浴血應戰、相持達二晝夜、敵死傷枕藉、始終未能越我防線一步、敵前次竭海陸空軍全力、曾二度總攻、均遭慘敗、此次蓋爲第三次也、茲將昨日江灣戰况、分誌於後、</p>
<h3 id="c4">敵軍三路攻擊 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>敵軍此次作戰·注全力於廟行鎭及江灣間之陣綫、敵軍自前晨開始向該綫進攻時、據外人調查、敵及該處備有大砲一百十三尊、坦克車及鐵甲車共四十餘輛、陸路飛機共三十餘架、全數用於該陣線上、陸軍兵力約一萬餘人、分正面與左右兩翼三路進攻、其正面配置於江灣鎭東北方、右翼在廟行鎭與孟家宅一帶、左翼在江灣車站東面、近復旦大學沿翔殷路前進、三路戰事截至今晨、已經兩晝夜之血戰、</p>
<h3 id="c5">孟家宅敵全滅 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>前日敵右翼約五百餘人、向江灣車站之西進攻我孟家宅防綫、在猛烈砲火掩護之下、勢力衝進、我軍躍出戰壕、肉搏應戰、並以奇兵截斷敵之後路、成包圍形勢、敵苦戰不得脫、至昨晨二時、全被我軍殲滅、昨晨拂曉起、敵更以坦克車數輛、排一字形、向前推進、行至距孟家宅我軍陣綫約一千餘米突處、忽有三數輛陷入陷阱、以致其餘各坦克車不敢再行前進、我軍當由戰壕中衝去、以手溜彈步槍及手提機關槍等、向敵坦克車後尾隨之大隊前進、待相距約二三百米突之時、我軍即下令衝鋒、一時入混戰狀態、雙方肉搏、血戰數小時、敵終以不支潰敗、</p>
<h3 id="c6">獲機關槍多架 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>至正面之敵自昨日迭次進攻江灣慘敗後、昨日上午十時、敵仍積極向我軍陣地衝擊、先以坦克車·機關槍·繼以步槍、復由重砲掩護進攻、向梅園宅·天樂寺、及江灣萬國體育塲進逼、我軍態度鎭靜、彈無虚發、俟其逼近我戰壕時、地雷機關槍同時齊發、而敵之砲彈遂失其效用、敵旅進旅退、衝攻十餘次、死傷無數、至下午四時、敵力竭停攻、我軍奪獲機關槍二十餘挺、及戰利品無算、</p>
<h3 id="c7">敵軍騎兵中伏 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>敵軍右翼以復旦大學爲中心、時時向我陣綫攻擊、均被我軍擊退、敵騎兵一小隊、中計被包圍、全部解决、惟該校子彬院、簡公堂樓上、及全部宿舍、及留校學生之行李、均被搗毀、該校附近之民屋、如李校長登輝住宅、亦被日機投彈焚燬云、</p>
<h3 id="c8">敵司令部移退 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>

<h3 id="c9">敵機擲彈幼稚 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>昨日下午二時、敵飛機兩架、在江灣復旦大學天空盤旋、擬向我軍陣地擲彈、結果落下之彈、竟中日軍陣地、炸壞唐克車二輛、足見日空軍技術之幼稚、</p>
<h3 id="c10">炸燬敵坦克車 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>

<p>擊中數彈、車站大部被燬、職員均安全出險並無死傷、</p>
<p>[P＞敵軍屠殺同胞</p>
<p>據由江灣公大紗廠救出之某馬夫云、日軍攻我江灣陣地、疊次慘敗、傷亡極衆、竟遷怒於當地居民、昨日被殺之同胞、達六七十人之多、可謂極人世之慘酷、</p>

<p>敵軍偷渡薀藻浜失敗　　我軍曾越薀藻浜擊敵　　敵艦夕張號中彈受傷　　吳淞口外、昨日下午有敵軍艦三十餘艘、飛機數架、向我獅子林砲台會攻、早晨四時許、亦有敵艦七艘、向砲台環攻、同時薀藻浜方面、有敵軍步兵二百餘名、向薀藻浜橋堍偷渡、均被我軍擊退、我軍陣線、仍無變動、茲將昨日戰况、紀述如後、</p>
<h3 id="c15">敵攻吳淞又失敗 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>昨晨四時許、敵艦七艘、在吳淞鎭附近之浦江中、向砲台灣方面開砲進攻、至十時許始停、下午三時、敵方復以軍艦三十餘艘、飛機數架、向我獅子林砲台集中火力、猛力轟炸、我軍沉着應戰、敵終不得逞、並有二五六號敵機一架、在劉行鎭方面、被八十七師擊落、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Precedent for National Defense and Revitalization ㈠ Bin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Today, our nation is in an extremely grave period, beset by both internal troubles and external aggression. People of the nation should all harbor a deep concern and be troubled by a major question that cannot be answered: Can our country truly defeat Japan? What will become of our nation's future? Such concern and anxiety are indeed essential, and precisely demonstrate that our nation has not yet lost its vital strength to maintain its survival. The future is very bright. Now, taking the new Turkey as an example, I ask the people of the nation to read a history of the revival of new Turkey.</p>
<p>After Turkey's disastrous defeat in the European War of 1918, it not only lost its political weight, but the entire country was in a state of chaos and disintegration. The nation's peril was imminent. At that time, the Greek army, advocating the "Great Greece" ideology, took advantage of the crisis and launched a large-scale offensive, occupying Smyrna in May 1919. Turkey's peril at that time far exceeded that of our country today. In this critical moment of life and death, Kemal and others rose up in eastern Asia Minor, leading the National Army, which had been trained for only a short time and was poorly equipped, to resist. They were defeated repeatedly, but ultimately did their best to hold the last line of defense. In early September 1921, they launched a fierce counterattack, and the Greek army suffered an irreversible defeat. On the tenth of that month, Smyrna was recovered. Although the retreating Greek army did its best to destroy everything, the great fire in Smyrna burned for nearly a week, and the essence of the city was lost. After three years of bitter fighting and great sacrifice, new Turkey finally laid its cornerstone under such difficult struggles and great sacrifices.</p>
<p>However, Turkey's revival was not solely the work of Kemal. The key factors for its success were: First, the awakening of the people, with everyone determined to die for the nation rather than submit to subjugation. Because of their deep resentment, firm belief, and heroic actions, they were ultimately able to seize the final victory. Second, the concentration of power, with the whole country united in purpose and action. Everyone clearly recognized the new goals of resisting foreign aggression and pacifying internal conflicts, sacrificing personal interests to serve the country. Third, the skillful use of diplomacy. On one hand, they resisted violence with strength; on the other hand, they established relations with friendly countries. With successful diplomacy, military supplies were also sufficient. Fourth, decisive response to opportunities. In both domestic and foreign affairs, they made quick decisions and did not procrastinate. With these factors, they were ultimately able to break through all the difficult and dangerous situations and enable new Turkey to stand independently in the world. People of the world could not help but look at it with new eyes.</p>
<p>As we look back at the historical traces of Turkey's revival, we should know that a nation that follows old ways and does not rouse itself will face difficulties, while for a nation that awakens and struggles, difficulties are precisely the driving force for success. Therefore, today, we do not need to ask how difficult the current situation is, but ask whether our nation has awakened, whether power has been concentrated, and whether we can make decisive decisions in times of emergency, completely abandoning old habits of procrastination. In diplomacy, whether we can have a fixed policy and an indomitable spirit, and be good at using it. If so, then the final victory is in our hands. History may not repeat the old drama of new Turkey's success, but at least it can serve as a precedent for our struggle and effort. Today, we must each do our part to fulfill the responsibility of resisting foreign aggression, and avoid internal disputes that will divide our forces. Today, we must be prepared for ten years of hard fighting, and especially be determined to endure any great losses and sacrifices. Heaven helps those who help themselves. The final victory or defeat will ultimately be decided on the battlefield, but we must rush to the front line with iron and blood. What is the use of anxiety?</p>
<p>Today, Reuters reports from Berlin that the "Börsen Zeitung" compares this Sino-Japanese War to the Hundred Years' War between England and France. France resisted foreign enemies with all its strength and eventually became a unified country, completely recovering its lost territories. The newspaper's intention is also that this Sino-Japanese War is bound to be protracted, and it places great hope on the ability of our people to strive and help themselves. Let our people be encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Military Continues General Offensive, Fails <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Fierce Battle at Jiangwan, Enemy Suffers Heavy Casualties. 700 Enemy Troops at Chih Chih University Annihilated. Enemy Headquarters Hit by Shells, Fire Spreads. Our Troops Shoot Down Three Enemy Planes.</p>
<p>Since dawn the day before yesterday, the Japanese army has dispatched naval, land, and air forces to launch a general offensive on our entire line for a whole day. As a result, they have suffered another disastrous defeat. Yesterday, from morning to night, they continued to attack our entire line at Jiangwan and Wusong forts. Our side also responded in full force. As of 2 a.m. this morning, the enemy had still not succeeded. Moreover, more than 700 Japanese soldiers inside Chih Chih University on Jiangwan Road were surrounded by our army and completely annihilated at around 5 p.m. At around 11 a.m., two enemy planes were shot down at Baziqiao in Miaohangzhen, and another was shot down at Liuhangzhen at around 3 p.m. The Zhabei area was relatively quiet yesterday, but at night we shelled the enemy headquarters (i.e., the Japanese elementary school on North Sichuan Road), which was hit by our shells and caught fire, with the fire spreading fiercely and causing many casualties. Several enemy planes flew to various places in our army's rear yesterday to scout and drop bombs, destroying many civilian houses and injuring many civilians. Also, on the morning of the 20th, an enemy ship was sunk and two were damaged by our Shizilin fort. One was damaged in the Yunzaobang area. The details obtained by this newspaper are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>As of 2 a.m. this morning, our army's front lines along Jiangwan, Mengjiazai, Jiangwan Station, Yunzaobang, Wusong, and Shizilin forts remain unchanged. There was no fighting in Zhabei last night.</p>

<p>Fierce Battle All Day, Enemy Troops Retreat. Two Enemy Tanks Destroyed. More Than 20 Machine Guns Captured. Enemy Headquarters Retreats to Yinxianggang.</p>
<p>After the enemy issued a general offensive order at 7:20 the morning before yesterday, their main forces concentrated on Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhabei, launching attacks simultaneously. Our army fought valiantly, holding out for two days and nights. The enemy suffered heavy casualties but never crossed our defense line by a single step. The enemy had previously launched two general offensives with all its naval, land, and air forces, both of which ended in disastrous defeat. This was the third time. The battle situation in Jiangwan yesterday is recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Enemy Launches Three-Pronged Attack <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>In this operation, the enemy focused all its efforts on the front line between Miaohangzhen and Jiangwan. According to foreign investigations, when the enemy began to attack this line the morning before yesterday, they had 113 artillery pieces, more than 40 tanks and armored vehicles, and more than 30 land-based aircraft, all used on this front line. The army had a force of about 10,000 men, divided into a frontal assault and attacks from the left and right flanks. The front was deployed northeast of Jiangwanzhen, the right flank was in the Miaohangzhen and Mengjiazai area, and the left flank was east of Jiangwan Station, advancing along Xiangyin Road near Fudan University. The fighting on all three fronts has been a bloody battle for two days and nights as of this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Enemy Completely Annihilated at Mengjiazai <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The enemy's right flank, with about 500 men, attacked our Mengjiazai defense line west of Jiangwan Station the day before yesterday. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, they rushed forward forcefully. Our army leaped out of the trenches and fought in hand-to-hand combat, and used surprise troops to cut off the enemy's retreat, forming an encirclement. The enemy fought hard but could not escape. By 2 a.m. yesterday, all were annihilated by our army. At dawn yesterday, the enemy advanced several tanks in a single line. When they reached about 1,000 meters from our army's front line at Mengjiazai, three or four suddenly fell into traps, causing the other tanks to dare not advance any further. Our army then rushed out of the trenches and used hand grenades, rifles, and submachine guns to attack the large force following behind the enemy tanks. When they were about 200 to 300 meters away, our army ordered a charge. A melee ensued, and both sides fought in hand-to-hand combat. After several hours of bloody fighting, the enemy finally collapsed and retreated.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Many Machine Guns Captured <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>As for the enemy on the front, after suffering repeated disastrous defeats in attacking Jiangwan yesterday, they still actively attacked our army's position at 10 a.m. yesterday, first with tanks and machine guns, followed by rifles, and then covered by heavy artillery fire, pressing towards Meiyuanzhai, Tianlesi, and Jiangwan Wanguo Sports Ground. Our army remained calm and accurate, waiting for them to approach our trenches. Then landmines and machine guns were fired simultaneously, and the enemy's shells lost their effectiveness. The enemy advanced and retreated repeatedly, launching more than ten attacks, suffering countless casualties. By 4 p.m., the enemy was exhausted and stopped attacking. Our army captured more than 20 machine guns and countless spoils of war.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Enemy Cavalry Ambushed <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The enemy's right flank used Fudan University as its center, attacking our front line from time to time, but were repelled by our army. A small squad of enemy cavalry was ambushed and completely eliminated. However, the Zibin Academy, Jian Gong Hall upstairs, and all the dormitories, as well as the luggage of the students staying at the school, were all destroyed. Civilian houses near the school, such as Principal Li Denghui's residence, were also burned down by Japanese planes.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Enemy Headquarters Moves Back <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>In Jiangwan, our army used the Jiangwan Racecourse as its base, while the enemy used the Yinxianggang Racecourse as its base. At 8 p.m. last night, the enemy attacked our Jiangwan Racecourse, and the hand-to-hand combat was extremely fierce. After a fierce battle for two hours, the enemy showed signs of collapse, and it was heard that the enemy headquarters had moved back to the Yinxianggang area.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Enemy Plane's Bombing Is Childish <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>At 2 p.m. yesterday, two enemy planes circled in the sky over Jiangwan Fudan University, intending to drop bombs on our army's position. As a result, the dropped bombs hit the Japanese army's position, destroying two tanks, demonstrating the childishness of the Japanese air force's technology.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Enemy Tanks Destroyed <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>There was a fierce battle in Jiangwan yesterday morning. After 10 a.m., the enemy used seven tanks to cover more than a thousand enemy troops, charging towards our army's defense line. As the enemy vehicles rushed forward, the landmines buried by our army exploded. Our army also counterattacked with machine guns and hand grenades, preventing the enemy from succeeding. Two enemy tanks were destroyed, and the remaining five tanks immediately retreated. At that time, the thousands of enemy troops were fiercely attacked by our army and fled behind the vehicles in a very disheveled manner, with casualties scattered all over the ground.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Jiangwan Station Bombed <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the enemy used heavy artillery to bombard our Jiangwan Station in Jiangwan. Several shells hit the station yesterday afternoon, and most of the station was destroyed. All staff members escaped safely without any casualties.</p>
<p>The enemy army massacres compatriots.</p>
<p>According to a groom rescued from the Gongda Yarn Factory in Jiangwan, the Japanese army attacked our Jiangwan position and suffered repeated disastrous defeats, resulting in heavy casualties. They vented their anger on the local residents. Yesterday, as many as sixty or seventy compatriots were killed. It can be said that it was extremely cruel.</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Great Calamity of Jiangwanzhen <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>In Jiangwan, there was fierce fighting all day yesterday. The enemy's artillery fired wildly, and the aircraft dropped bombs, so there were five or six large fires in Jiangwanzhen and its vicinity. The reporter went to investigate and met several refugees on the way. According to them, the Dongyue Temple in Jiangwanzhen was bombed and dozens of houses were destroyed. In Xinjiangwan, all the houses were burned because Japanese planes dropped sulfur bombs, about dozens of houses. When I escaped, the fire had not yet been extinguished. In Beinongkou, no bombs were seen, but the doors and windows of several large shops such as Yao Xinyi and Lu Dingsen were shattered. The number of civilians killed by bombing and burning on the street must be hundreds. There are still residents in that place who have not been able to escape, and they are afraid that they will either be shot or starved to death. The speaker couldn't stop crying.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Fierce Battle at Chih Chih University <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Surrounded, Bloody Battle for Five Hours. All 700 People Killed. At 12 noon yesterday, about 700 Japanese troops inside Chih Chih University in Jiangwan were first bombarded by our army with heavy artillery, followed by a fierce charge by a large force. The fighting between the two sides was extremely fierce. Another unit of our army attacked from the rear, completely surrounding the enemy. By 5 p.m., all 700 enemy troops had been annihilated, with no survivors. According to reports, at around 8 p.m. last night, four or five Japanese trucks filled with Japanese corpses drove from North Sichuan Road to Yangshupu.

<p>Enemy Attempts to Cross Yunzaobang by Stealth, Fails. Our Army Crossed Yunzaobang to Attack the Enemy. Enemy Ship Yubari Damaged by Shells. Outside Wusongkou, more than 30 enemy warships and several aircraft attacked our Shizilin Fort yesterday afternoon. At around 4 a.m., seven enemy warships also encircled the fort. At the same time, about 200 enemy infantrymen in the Yunzaobang area attempted to cross the Yunzaobang Bridge by stealth, but were repelled by our army. Our army's front line remains unchanged. The battle situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>

<p>At around 4 a.m. yesterday, seven enemy warships fired and attacked Pao Taiwan from the Huangpu River near Wusongzhen. They stopped at around 10 a.m. At 3 p.m., the enemy again used more than 30 warships and several aircraft to concentrate fire on our Shizilin Fort, fiercely bombing it. Our army responded calmly, and the enemy ultimately did not succeed. An enemy plane No. 256 was shot down by the 87th Division in the Liuhangzhen area.</p>

<p>At around 4 a.m. yesterday, more than 200 enemy infantrymen, riding in four iron-hulled barges, protected by enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River, sailed into Yunzaobang, hoping to sneak across the Yunzaobang Bridge</p>
<p>cross the bank and seize our army's trenches. When the barges sailed into the harbor, they were discovered by our army, who immediately swept them with machine guns. The enemy could not withstand it and immediately retreated. At around 7 a.m., three enemy planes flew in from outside the mouth of the harbor and dropped more than a dozen shells on the fort and the Yunzaobang area. The enemy forces on the Yunzaobang front still used artillery to bombard yesterday and did not attempt to attack, so there were no special changes in the front lines on both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Our Army Once Crossed Yunzaobang to Attack <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>According to a Reuters news agency message from the Central News Agency at 4 p.m. on the 21st, the Japanese reported that the Chinese army on the Wusong front suddenly crossed Yunzaobang this morning and attacked the Japanese army's position. All parties expressed astonishment at the Chinese army's bravery, because the Chinese army was able to cross Yunzaobang under the fierce attack of the Japanese army's naval and air forces, and it was considered to be greatly commendable. As of now, the Japanese army's offensive has not made any progress. In Jiangwan, the Chinese army's resistance has been extremely fierce, and the Japanese army's offensive has not succeeded. Although the Japanese army flew at low altitude with its air force and attacked with machine guns, the Chinese army still held its ground. Several shells fired by the Chinese army fell on the Japanese headquarters.</p>

<p>At 3 a.m. the day before yesterday, more than ten enemy warships surrounded and attacked our Shizilin Fort. After our army returned fire, the fierce battle lasted until about 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. As a result, one Japanese warship was sunk and two were damaged. The remaining ships fled in a disheveled manner.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Enemy Ship Yubari Damaged <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable information yesterday, when the enemy attacked our Wusong the day before yesterday, the enemy's command ship Yubari was berthed at the Zhang Huabang grain station pier. At about 2 p.m. on the 20th, it was hit by our army's shells in the stern gun position, destroying a large cannon and killing two Japanese soldiers. After the ship was hit and damaged, it sailed away from the pier and retreated to the Huangpu River in front of the Guanghua Oil Depot. According to the Continental News, yesterday (20th), when Japanese warships and planes bombarded Wusong, the Chinese army returned fire with machine guns and rifles, and occasionally fired artillery. It is said that one shell hit the Japanese destroyer Yubari, which was in command of operations. The ship immediately withdrew from the battle line.</p>

<p>Zhang Agui, a worker who escaped from the Water and Electricity Village yesterday morning, said that after the general offensive began the day before yesterday, he hid in the toilet behind the Water and Electricity Plant and could not escape until the sound of guns and cannons was slightly thinner after 7 a.m. yesterday morning. He then transferred to the Sanyang Road and escaped the danger with the Red Cross vehicle. He saw four trucks full of Japanese soldiers' corpses driving from Jungong Road to Yangshupu via the Water and Electricity Village at 5:30 a.m. After 6 a.m., seven more trucks of corpses were transported, with severed heads and arms, which was extremely tragic. The road was covered with blood where the vehicles passed. When he was looking for a way to escape, he saw two large trucks carrying about 80 Japanese corpses. The trucks were covered with white cloth, and four Japanese soldiers escorted the trucks, covered in blood and looking very depressed. A certain gentleman's chauffeur, who was captured by the Japanese army, witnessed dozens of trucks transporting Japanese soldiers' corpses and wounded soldiers, estimated at no less than a thousand people. He also personally participated in the service, and was fortunate to escape by taking advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<p>Enemy Launches Three-Pronged Attack, All Repelled by Our Army. After the enemy's general offensive, although its focus shifted to the Jiangwan area, it still occasionally charged with units of one or two hundred men, or dozens of men, to disrupt our army's front line. Yesterday morning, there were still contacts in Xinmin Road, Chuangong Road, and other places. The details are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Enemy Attacks Xinmin Road <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>At about 10 a.m. yesterday, the enemy army first opened fire with four or five artillery pieces, and then used an armored vehicle to cover 500 army soldiers in yellow uniforms, charging towards the defense area of Xinmin Road. Our army fired a shot from the sandbag, piercing a large hole in the enemy's armored vehicle. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy army in the vehicle fled backward. At the same time, more than 500 enemy troops were also shot down by our army. The fighting time in this battle was only about an hour. At about 4 p.m. in the afternoon, the enemy rushed out from that place again, but was repelled by our army with machine guns.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Enemy Collapses Again on Chuangong Road <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>At about 8 a.m. yesterday, about 200 enemy soldiers along North Sichuan Road suddenly attacked Chuangong Road. Our army engaged in battle on Guangdong Street, and fierce street fighting began again. Our army's mortars and machine guns played a powerful role. The vanguard of the Japanese army collapsed and died one after another. Seeing this, the rear enemy soldiers quickly retreated. Our army took the opportunity to pursue and killed more than ten enemy soldiers, and the enemy retreated to Bazilu, Disweilu, and other places.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Fierce Fighting in Tientong'an <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>At 11:15 yesterday afternoon, the Japanese army fired artillery at our army's position in the Tientong'an area. Our army did not return fire. At 11:25, four or five hundred Japanese soldiers, seeing that we were not moving, took advantage of the artillery fire to charge our army. Our army responded calmly. When the Japanese army arrived at 100 yards outside our defense line, they launched a fierce sweeping attack with machine guns, rifles, and hand grenades, instantly killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated backwards in confusion. Our army immediately left the trenches and pursued, killing dozens more Japanese soldiers, leaving corpses all over the ground and capturing more than 100 rifles.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Japanese Army Wastes Artillery Fire <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, yesterday (20th), the Chinese army in Zhabei responded calmly, staying beside the cannons and waiting for the Japanese army to attack, only occasionally responding with one or two cannons. The Japanese army fired artillery continuously, mostly from the artillery position at the Bazichang shooting range. When they fired wildly, the cannons fired like crazy, with small steel cannons and half cannons of four pounds fired in sequence. Each artillery team there had three teams of cannons, and the artillery sound was constant from morning to afternoon. Each time, after the first cannon fired, the sixth cannon followed, and then the second, ninth, fifth, eighth, third, seventh, and fourth cannons fired in succession, again and again. Every half minute, a cannon was fired. Not only was the order not chaotic, but the timing was also accurate, almost like a clock. For the enemy, the effectiveness was extremely limited. Only thick smoke was seen rising into the sky in various places in Zhabei, simply burning down civilian houses. However, solid buildings, although heavily bombarded, often stood firm. As for the Chinese army, it was extremely calm, staying inside the front line, observing the enemy's movements. If they saw the enemy trying to advance, they immediately responded, which was extremely vigilant. But if one or two Japanese soldiers exposed their bodies, they were regarded as unseen and did not fire their guns, because the Chinese soldiers apparently thought that one or two enemy soldiers were not worth mentioning. It was also seen that there was a small alley on North Sichuan Road, and the houses around it had been mostly destroyed as rubble, but the alley was still completely preserved, and there were still several children playing there, as usual. They were not afraid of the loud cannon sounds.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Our Army's Casualties Very Few <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, although the Japanese army bombarded fiercely with artillery and machine guns all day yesterday (20th), the Chinese army's casualties were very few. According to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road, only 19 wounded soldiers and 11 civilians wounded by stray bullets were admitted to the hospital yesterday. At about 4 p.m. in the afternoon, the hospital's ambulance rushed to Gongxing Road and Jiangwanzhen to take advantage of the short ceasefire to rush to rescue the wounded soldiers and carry them back to a safe place. Several soldiers were seriously injured and may not recover. As for the 11 civilians, they were rescued in the Fanhuangdu and Kangnaotuo Road area. The hospital has so far admitted a total of 242 wounded soldiers and civilians, of which 27 have died from their injuries, 2 have been discharged from the hospital after being cured, and 45 have been transferred to other places. Currently, there are still 168 people in the hospital.</p>

<p>Fire Breaks Out and Spreads, Shells Fly Horizontally. Chinese and Foreign Firefighters Seriously Injured. Many Japanese Soldiers and Chinese People Killed and Wounded. The Japanese army headquarters at the Yokohama Bridge Japanese Elementary School on North Sichuan Road was hit by our army's shelling last night, and a fire broke out immediately, spreading fiercely. The Hongkou Fire Brigade in charge of the area drove to the scene after receiving the news. When they were about to reach their destination, they could not get close because the artillery fire was too fierce and bullets were flying horizontally. They then returned. They went to the scene again at about 10 o'clock to rescue, when the sound of gunfire was slightly less. However, shortly after, shells came again, and the fire brigade district chief Miller was shot in the waist. Western volunteer members Pailas and team member Kaisier were also hit by stray bullets, one in the right leg and one in the left leg, and were sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment. Chinese members Zhang Xiaokang No. 173, Zhang Youshen No. 456, and Qu Qingtai No. 273 were also injured. Chinese captain Ye Bihen almost suffered a bullet injury while bravely fighting the fire. Dozens of Japanese soldiers inside were killed by the shells, and the rest fled in panic. There were no lights in the house, and it was dark. It was also seen that there were many Chinese people being held captive, who were about to be buried in the fire.</p>

<p>Dropping Bombs on Places Such as Nanxiang and Huangdu　　Nanxiang Stationmaster Xu Dies from Bomb Blast　　Unable to Harm the Slightest Part of Our Military Line　　Yesterday, enemy aircraft flew to Nanxiang and Huangdu and dropped more than a dozen bombs with great explosive power. Their intention was to disrupt our rear and destroy the railway. Nanxiang Stationmaster Xu Bin died from a bomb blast. More than a dozen refugees were bombed to death. In addition to Nanxiang, enemy aircraft also dropped bombs on places such as Dachang, Liuhang, Liuhe, Zhenru, and Zhabei, resulting in deaths and injuries. However, three enemy aircraft were shot down by our army in the areas of Liuhang Temple and Baziqiao. The Japanese pilots were killed on the spot.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Nanxiang <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, six Japanese aircraft flew from Zhabei and Zhenru to Nanxiang and Huangdu, dropping bombs. Two bombs were dropped at Huangdu Station, falling into the rice fields and not detonating. A total of nine bombs were dropped at Nanxiang, all of which were 200-pound bombs. At that time, countless refugees were gathered on the station platform waiting for trains. The enemy aircraft mistook them for our troops and dropped a bomb, which landed near the platform. None of the more than ten refugees in front survived and were all killed. More than ten people were also injured and immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Not long after, another bomb exploded in the station. Fortunately, it was far from the station, so only one person was slightly injured. Soon, the streets of Nanxiang were also bombed, with fires breaking out in three places. When the station staff were still working, the Japanese aircraft returned and dropped bombs, which landed in the Xiaobang next to the station, a total of three or four, which did not explode. The Japanese aircraft suddenly changed altitude, only about three or four hundred feet above the ground, and at the same time used machine guns to sweep around the station, bullets raining down. About ten villagers next to the station were hit by stray bullets. Station staff in the station staff dormitory were also rushing to escape. Xu Bin, the stationmaster who had just escaped from Zhanghuabang Station and was assigned to work at Nanxiang Station, was shot and killed just as he stepped out of the dormitory door. Police Chief Dong of the Railway Bureau and three or four farmers were also seriously injured. The situation was very chaotic at the time. Our army's anti-aircraft guns, rifles, and machine guns also fired at the Japanese aircraft. As a result, one was hit by our army and fell outside the east of Nanxiang Station, waving its flag. When our army chased after it, it took off again and fled towards Zhabei. Another report said that at about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, six or seven Japanese aircraft arrived in the Nanxiang area again, scattering leaflets, bread, and black dates, and sometimes even spraying black medicinal liquid. However, the bread was found to contain poison, and the villagers discarded it without regard.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Dachang <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Chinese Red Cross Society dispatched fifteen ambulance teams yesterday morning, and along with eleven teams, set off for Yangxing and arrived at the head of Dachang Village. At 11:30 AM, thirteen Japanese aircraft dropped bombs like rain. The team members all took shelter in the grass. Li Shangrong, an ambulance member of the 15th team, lost his scarf and wallet. Bao Feng Temple in Dachang, built in the 14th year of the Republic of China and covering an area of one hundred and several tens of acres, was said to have been half destroyed. The Huiji Hospital set up by the Hui Sheng Society in the back was also bombed, and wounded soldiers were inside. Three refugees, Zheng Laoliu, his son Gui Sheng, and his wife Zheng Gongshi, were rescued and sent to Renji Hall. His elder brother Zheng Laotai and his daughter-in-law were both bombed to death. At 2:00 PM, Wu Jiasan of the 15th team personally went to Dachang to inspect. There were no aircraft in the air. It was said that there were more than a hundred wounded soldiers urgently awaiting rescue. (2) Along the Huhu Great Road, Dachang Town was attacked by more than ten enemy aircraft flying from the east at 6:25 AM yesterday. They circled the space above the Dachang Bus Station. Looking at other places, there were still two or three teams of three aircraft each, totaling more than thirty Japanese aircraft that flew out yesterday. At about 7:00 AM, the enemy began bombing and opened machine guns to sweep down. As a result, one bomb hit the Huta Road next to the station, and the roadbed became a large pit. Public bus No. 954 parked beside the road was also damaged in the front cylinder. One bomb also hit the north of the Dragon King Bridge (i.e., Pingjiang Bridge), and more than ten houses were destroyed. One bomb hit the open space in front of Dachang Station, and the soil flew up. Three bombs hit the flourishing area of the east city of Dragon King Bridge, for a total of six bombs dropped. After dropping the bombs, they went south. At noon at 12:00, two more aircraft came and dropped four or five bombs back and forth, all falling in the villages near Dachang. At 1:40 PM, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency arrived in Dachang and saw three men and one old woman dead on the Huta Road next to the station. The old woman still had a cloth bag around her arm, seemingly trying to escape when she encountered the disaster. Two civilians and one soldier died in the open space in front of the station. The civilians seemed to be standing and watching the villagers. As for the injured, they all went to the Lianzhou Hospital for treatment. Four people died east of the Dragon King Bridge, one of whom was buried by the mud from the wall. He was dug out but not yet dead and was rescued by the Red Cross Society for treatment. (3) At about 10:00 AM yesterday, three Japanese aircraft came to Zhangjiazhai, which is about three miles away from Dachang Town in Baoshan County. Suspecting that troops were stationed there, they dropped six bombs, destroying more than ten civilian houses, killing two men and one woman and child. Two other women and one child were seriously injured. After being reported, the local Red Cross Society rescued them and carried them away for treatment.</p>

<p>Gujiazhai Town between Dachang and Liuhang was attacked by two teams of Japanese aircraft, six aircraft, at about 9:00 AM yesterday, dropping two bombs and then flying towards Dachang. At 12:30 PM, three more aircraft came and circled for about three quarters of an hour. Two of them flew very low, and one soldier accidentally fired a shot, which unexpectedly hit a key component. It immediately fell in front of the gate of the Baoshan Yarn Factory. All three pilots were killed. The Japanese aircraft's number was 356.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Liuhe <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>In the Liuhe area, one enemy aircraft flew to drop two bombs yesterday morning, which fell near Yanglinkou, injuring one passerby and destroying several thatched huts.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Zhenru <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>At 9:05 AM yesterday morning, six or seven enemy aircraft flew from east to west to Zhenru. Our army immediately opened fire with extremely dense anti-aircraft guns. The enemy aircraft dared not fly low. After reconnaissance for about an hour, they dropped two bombs and then split into two teams and flew east and west. At 1:30 PM, three more aircraft came from the west. After reconnaissance for a quarter of an hour, they dropped two bombs in succession, one falling on the west bank of Yangjia Bridge, i.e., the west road of Taopu, and the other falling on the east bank of Yangjia Bridge. The shops along the shore from No. 2 to No. 7 were all knocked down. On the west side, Nos. 21, 23, and 25 were destroyed, and three people, including an old man and an old woman, died. The old man's name was Sun Ruiqing, a native of Hubei, who escaped to Shanghai due to the flood. Cai Linsheng, a policeman, a car driver, and more than ten other people were injured. Looking at their purpose, they originally intended to destroy Yangjia Bridge, but because they flew high, they slightly deviated and fell on the east and west banks. Afterwards, all the aircraft gathered and flew north along Taopu West Road to near the International Radio Station, dropping five or six bombs one after another. Fortunately, most of them fell in the fields, so no one was injured during the explosion. Because the anti-aircraft guns there fired fiercely, the enemy aircraft flew high for a while and fled towards Wusong.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Zhabei <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Several aircraft also went to Zhabei for reconnaissance yesterday. The area over Tiantong'an Road was the most active. Also, aircraft dropped many bombs at the intersection of Datong Road and Zhongxing Road in Zhabei the day before yesterday, most of which did not explode. The only things destroyed were a house in the Jialing Guild Hall on Taiyangmiao Road and a corner of the newly built Daxing Vegetable Market at the intersection of Datong Road and Zhongxing Road. There was still a bomb south of the vegetable market that had not exploded and was still left in the straw there. It looked like a large olive, white with slightly red veins, about two feet long, with a copper cover at one end, which seemed to be the entrance for the explosive.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Many Enemy Bombs Fall in the Concession <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Fan Qiwu's Explanation　　Reporters from various newspapers personally visited the 19th Route Army at 3:00 PM yesterday and asked Chief of Staff Fan Qiwu of the army about the frequent falling of artillery shells in the concession, asking if they were fired by our troops. Chief of Staff Fan smiled at the reporter and said that such right and wrong are very easy to understand. Please carefully examine the Shanghai map, and you will know the answer. It is found that the enemy's artillery positions are northeast of the International Recreation Ground, so the shells fired towards Zhabei often mistakenly fall into the concession. It has been found that in the past two weeks, the Japanese army has been attacking us and firing indiscriminately, so many of their stray bullets have fallen into the concession. However, the Japanese are cunning and often spread rumors, saying that they were fired by our army. Outsiders do not investigate and take it as fact. All the artillery fired by our side is aimed at the enemy artillery positions northeast of the International Recreation Ground and the enemy in Yinhang Town. No matter what kind of artillery is used, shells will never fall into the concession. Now, the letter from Staff Officer Yang Jijang of our army's general headquarters can be sent for your review, and everything will be clear. He then retrieved the original letter from Staff Officer Yang on the desk, which is transcribed below. Mr. Zhilu, in recent days, many stray bullets have fallen in the concession. The Japanese side is spreading rumors, saying that they were fired by us. Outsiders do not investigate and often misunderstand. Now, the actual situation is explained below. Please declare to our side, so that it is known that the Japanese side should be responsible for destroying the security of the concession. It has been found that the enemy's artillery positions are northeast of the International Recreation Ground and are firing towards Zhabei, so their artillery shells are more likely to fall into the concession. Our side is firing at the enemy artillery positions northeast of the International Recreation Ground and the enemy in Yinhang Town, so artillery shells will never stray into the concession. (See the Shanghai City Area Map.) Please thoroughly declare the above situation to foreigners. Respectfully yours, Yang Jijang</p>

<p>Japanese Viciously Set Fires　　The Huge Losses Are Difficult to Estimate　　The great fire in the Zhabei and Hongkou areas has continued to grow in recent days, and the huge losses are difficult to estimate. According to the reports received yesterday, they are recorded as follows: (1) The houses in the Yuanyuanli area of Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei suddenly caught fire the night before last, spreading to Zideli, Changshouli, Jianhua Shenji Textile Factory, and the houses in the warehouse area. It was still not extinguished yesterday. It is said that the Jianhua Factory alone suffered losses worth about more than 200,000 yuan. It is still impossible to investigate other places such as Yuanyuanli. (2) At about 7:00 PM last night, a fire broke out next to the Japanese school on North Sichuan Road, and the fire spread very fiercely. The Hongkou Fire Brigade drove to put out the fire, but returned halfway due to the large number of stray bullets. Later, it was heard that the sound of gunfire was less frequent, so they ventured forward again, but suddenly bullets flew across, injuring three Chinese and Western firefighters each. (3) At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out at 176, 7, 8, and 3 Wusong Road, and Xu Fuxing Woodworking, Jingshan Porcelain Shop, etc. were all burned down.

The forty-two Jiangbei thatched sheds behind them were all burned down. There were six corpses of Chinese people shot dead by Japanese soldiers inside. After receiving the news, the Jiaxing Road Police Station immediately moved them away. When the firefighters were putting out the fire, a bomb suddenly exploded, fortunately without injuring anyone. (5) More than thirty thatched sheds on Oujia Road caught fire at about 7:00 PM last night. Four residents inside were all shot and bombed to death. (6) At 6:45 PM the night before last, Japanese people used traitors to set fire and rob at 83, 5, and 7, Lane 2, Qingyunli, Tiantong Road, North Sichuan Road.

<p>The Book Industry Association Submits a Request for Compensation</p>
<h3 id="e41">Losses of the Commercial Press <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Book Industry Association believes that the Commercial Press is the largest cultural undertaking in China and has been burned down by Japanese soldiers with bombs, causing great losses. Yesterday, it specially prepared a document and submitted it to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with Japan and demand compensation. The following is an excerpt from the original text: It has been found that the library is the largest cultural undertaking in China, publishing no less than 10,000 kinds of books. The Oriental Library is the only great library in Shanghai, and its collection of ancient books is a magnificent sight. The Japanese deliberately destroyed it, violating public law. Without prior warning, they suddenly used aircraft to release sulfur bombs and burned it to the ground. The tangible losses are over 10 million, and the intangible losses are incalculable. It is requested that your Yuan (Ministry) promptly lodge a serious protest with Japan and declare that you reserve the right to claim compensation for losses. I cannot help but anxiously wait for it to happen.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Central Committee Members Stationed in Shanghai Urge Zhang Xueliang to Recover the Lost Territories in the Northeast <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Opportunity Cannot Be Missed, Please Do Not Sit and Wait　　General Zhang Hanqing of Beiping, Your Excellency, the Eastern Provinces have been trampled under the iron hooves of the violent Japanese for five months. Our thirty million compatriots are suffering and wailing day and night. We look to you for mercy and rescue. Your Excellency may not hear their sad voices, but you can imagine their pain. Every time I think of this, my heart is broken into pieces. I have heard that Your Excellency has been enduring humiliation and bitterness for months, preparing the army and planning to recover the lost territories. After the grief, I cannot help but feel happy. However, it has been delayed until now, and I have not seen any action. I am puzzled. Is it because the time has not come? The enemy forces have been repeatedly defeated in their invasion of Shanghai and are now increasing their troops to the Yangtze River and cannot concentrate on the Northeast. The opportunity cannot be missed, please do not sit and wait. Is it because the strength is not enough to defeat the enemy? Your Excellency previously said that you could not resist the entire Japanese army with only the troops in one corner of the Northeast. Now, the 19th Route Army is fighting the violent Japanese army's land, sea, and air forces for more than ten days with only more than 20,000 officers and soldiers. On our side, not an inch of land has been lost, and the enemy has suffered great punishment. Spirit is more important than material, and the facts have clearly told us. A certain country's ambassador said to someone yesterday, "Since our army resisted in Shanghai on January 28th, the Chinese nation has opened a new era of revival in the world." The League of Nations sent a strong note to Japan on the 16th of this month, not recognizing its violent occupation of the land. This shows that struggle can lead to survival, and cowardice will inevitably lead to destruction. Heaven helps those who help themselves, and there is no error in principle. The honor of the 19th Army's loyalty and resistance to aggression has spread all over the world. Our destiny lies in self-determination. Your Excellency has more than 200,000 troops and it is not impossible to recover the Eastern Provinces. In the past, people broke their pots and sank their boats, and suddenly defeated the strong enemy. They set up a camp with their backs to the water and immediately achieved miraculous feats. Today's matter depends entirely on Your Excellency's determination and courage. I believe that the recovery of the Eastern Provinces is not only important to the survival of our country and nation, but also not small to the honor and disgrace of Your Excellency's personal history. Moreover, Your Excellency's ancestral tomb is in Shenyang, and the spirits of your ancestors have not been buried. If you do not plan to recover it, how can you be filial? The beautiful rivers and mountains are offered to others with both hands. If you do not plan to recover them, it is called disloyalty. How can one be human if one is disloyal and unfilial? It is hoped that you will resolutely rise up, launch a large-scale attack, drive away the ugly captives, and return our rivers and mountains, saving the country from danger and shame for Your Excellency. There is a common understanding of public and private interests. Otherwise, the crime of non-resistance will never be washed away, and the elders of the Eastern Provinces will also be trapped in a state of eternal damnation. Even if Your Excellency feels at ease, the people of the country will not forgive Your Excellency. Leaving a stench or a fragrance depends on one thought. Thinking about the true interests of Your Excellency, the Central Committee of the Chinese National Party stationed in Shanghai bows respectfully, number.</p>

<p>Japanese Soldiers Abduct Young Girls　Yesterday morning, a local woman, Gu Shen, who lived at No. 34 Yurenli, east of the Huishan Police Station, had a daughter named Gu Jindi, who is 19 years old. She has been betrothed to someone and is scheduled to marry this spring. She used to work in a yarn factory there. The mother and daughter also carried their clothes bags yesterday and walked out of their home. They walked to the Tilanqiao tram station to wait for the tram. However, the passengers were extremely crowded. The mother and daughter were unable to squeeze in, so they retreated to the street on the opposite side to rest temporarily. Unexpectedly, two or three Japanese soldiers came and, seeing that Jindi was somewhat attractive, forcibly dragged Jindi onto the car parked there and drove quickly towards North Yangshupu. Her mother cried and shouted all the way, but no one came out to help. Since her beloved daughter had been arrested, she returned home.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Falsely Accuse Chinese Workers　After the Public Security Bureau paid attention to the incident of Japanese soldiers shooting and killing Chinese worker Zhang Xiaoerzi at the Old White Ferry in Pudong, it has recently learned that 50 Japanese marines are stationed in the Osaka Warehouse at the Old White Ferry, with steel cannons and machine guns. The pier area there has become a Japanese sphere of influence, and Chinese people dare not approach. The night before last, a small worker from Jiangbei was passing by and was caught by Japanese soldiers. They tied him up and accused him of being a Chinese detective, intending to execute him by shooting. Later, the police from the first precinct of the third district arrived and negotiated. The Japanese soldiers said that this person was a thief stealing rice and wheat from the Osaka Warehouse. The police said that since he was a thief, he should be punished. At that time, many Chinese police officers had arrived, so the Japanese soldiers handed him over to the Chinese police to take him to the district, but firmly demanded a receipt, proving that this person was a thief and that Chinese officials must severely punish him before they left.</p>

<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to all industry associations, encouraging them to save money from spring banquets and use it to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers at the front lines. The original letter stated: Respected Sirs, On the 21st of this month, the Shanghai Fruit and Produce Industry Association stated in a letter that, "The Japanese are exhausting their military power, first occupying the Northeast and then attacking Shanghai. The poisonous flames are spreading and becoming more intense every day. This is a critical moment for the survival of our nation, a day of hand-to-hand combat for survival. Without the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and to seek life from death, there is no way to achieve a long-term confrontation and save the nation from its perilous state." Yesterday, the 27th meeting of the Executive Committee decided to abolish the spring banquet, reduce expenses, and use the banquet funds to comfort the soldiers at the front lines or to meet the needs of disaster relief, doing our part. At this time of national crisis, contributing funds for assistance is a matter of common sympathy. It is hoped that the people of the country will share this understanding and follow suit. Then our nation will be fortunate. In addition to publishing a statement in the newspaper, we are sending this special letter to inform you, hoping that you will investigate and promptly inform all industry associations to support this initiative. According to this, every year at the beginning of the lunar year, various industries have spring banquets. Now that the Japanese invaders are attacking our territory and the nation is facing a crisis, the soldiers at the front lines are fighting bloody battles to protect our country's land and strive for the survival of our nation. How can we, the people in the rear, bear to be at ease and still follow the customs? The association's proposal to use the funds from spring banquets to comfort the troops is indeed a crucial move. It is appropriate to send a separate letter to each association to inform them, and we hope that all associations will follow suit and submit the funds to this association for consolidated management. This is of utmost importance.</p>

It is reported that the association will stop making vests after the cotton coats and will switch to making shirts, pants, and socks, and will purchase items needed by the military as much as possible, such as curved telescopes, to be practical and avoid waste. It is hoped that all sectors of society will give their support as soon as possible. The association's letter to Brigade Commander Weng is as follows: Respected Sir, Since the Japanese invaders have encroached and ravaged Shanghai, fortunately, our armed comrades who defend the country and resist the enemy have fought bravely and repeatedly annihilated the ugly prisoners, making it difficult for their fierce flames to spread, and the whole world is delighted. However, this is not only due to the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers and their eagerness to follow orders, but also to the brigade commander's proper command and effective dispatch. This association was initiated to meet the urgent needs of our patriotic soldiers. Recently, we learned that the front lines need something more urgent than clothing, so we first purchased a pair of scissors-shaped binoculars with the small funds we have collected, specially for the brigade commander to use in reconnaissance of the enemy's situation on the front lines. We are still continuing to solicit donations and will prepare various telescopes to aid military affairs. We respectfully ask the brigade commander to convey to the loyal and brave comrades on the front lines that although we women's circles cannot personally take up arms to defend against aggression, we offer fragrant prayers and congratulate you in advance on your victory, and we have never forgotten you for a moment. Respectfully, to Brigade Commander Weng.</p>

<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a telegram from the Siam Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok, saying that it will raise funds to relieve refugees in Shanghai. The telegram and the Chamber of Commerce's reply are recorded below: "Telegram from Siam" To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, countless refugees are in dire need of relief. This association immediately requested the local government to allow public fundraising among overseas Chinese. However, after several twists and turns, the verbal reply was only recently received, stating that the Shanghai Red Cross Society must send a telegram to the Siam Red Cross Society before it can proceed. This association believes that the Chinese Red Cross Society is also a charitable organization, and that the funds raised in the future will be handed over to the Society for relief, and will naturally be widely beneficial. Therefore, it was decided to discuss with the Red Cross Society to send a telegram to the Siam Red Cross Society and this association as soon as possible to promote fundraising, which is greatly hoped for. "Chamber of Commerce Reply" To the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok, Received your telegram. After the overseas Chinese suffered huge losses in the fire, they still care about the military disaster in Shanghai, and try to raise funds for disaster relief in a roundabout way. Their righteousness is as high as the sky, which is moving. Your telegram has been forwarded to the Red Cross Society. Please accept our advance thanks. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>Plotting to Bomb the Minguo Road Radio Station At 10:45 yesterday morning, a Japanese plainclothes team member wearing black jacket and trousers was suddenly seen loitering and observing near the entrance of Renxin Lane, opposite the Minguo Road Radio Station, seemingly plotting something. At that time, two children living in the lane were playing at the entrance. Seeing that this person in black resembled a Japanese, they shouted "Down with the Japanese!" The Japanese plainclothes team member, believing it to be true, attempted to flee towards Xiande Lane. The crowd followed behind him. They saw the person in black fumbling at his waist, raising suspicion. When he reached Fada Road, a Chinese constable stationed there was informed by passersby. The constable searched him and found three bombs tied with thin hemp rope around the Japanese plainclothes team member's waist, two in the front and one in the back. The Chinese constable immediately interrogated him, but the Japanese plainclothes team member did not understand Chinese and remained silent. He was immediately taken into custody at the police station for further investigation.</p>

<p>Denying All Independent Organizations in the Eastern Provinces (Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a declaration on the evening of the 21st regarding the so-called independence movement in the Eastern Three Provinces, stating: The Three Eastern Provinces have always been a part of Chinese territory. Any encroachment or interference with the administrative power of that area is a direct infringement on the integrity of China's territory and administrative power. Article 1 of the National Government Organization Law promulgated by the National Government on October 4, 17, stipulates that the National Government has full control over the governance of the Republic of China. Furthermore, the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the Period of Political Tutelage, promulgated on June 1, 20, clearly stipulates in Article 1 that the territory of the Republic of China consists of the provinces, Mongolia, and Tibet, and Article 3 further stipulates that the Republic of China shall forever be a unified republic. All these fundamental laws have been formally promulgated in the Three Eastern Provinces and other provinces of China. Furthermore, in terms of international law, territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity are essential elements for all sovereign states, and China's territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity are guaranteed by Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty. Not only that, item 2 of the resolution on the Eastern Case by the Council of the League of Nations on September 30 of last year stated that the Japanese government declared that it had no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, which the Council considered important. Its fifth resolution further stated that the Council was aware that representatives from both China and Japan had guaranteed that the two governments would take all steps to prevent the expansion of the incident and the further aggravation of the situation. This resolution was indeed accepted by Japan. Subsequently, item 3 of the second resolution of the Council on October 24 and the third resolution of the Council on December 10 have repeatedly reiterated the above. The resolution of December 10 was also accepted by Japan. At that time, the Chinese representative made the following statement: China will consider any plans by Japan to cause political disputes that affect the integrity of China's territorial administration, such as instigating the Manchurian independence movement, as a violation of its commitment to avoid aggravating the situation. However, the Japanese authorities, disregarding all laws, international agreements, and international credibility, after illegally invading the Eastern Provinces, further sought to establish so-called independent governments there and exerted all their efforts to force the Chinese people to violate their individual freedom of will to participate in such puppet organizations. The National Government has repeatedly made solemn protests regarding these illegal actions by Japan. Now, it hereby declares again that any separation or independence of the Three Eastern Provinces or part thereof, as well as all administrative organizations within the Three Eastern Provinces, that have not been authorized or agreed to by the National Government are hereby denied.

<h3 id="e97">Wang Zhaoming's Telegram Regarding the Reply to the Japanese Ultimatum <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhaoming's telegram reads: Urgent. To all provincial and municipal governments, military commanders, public organizations, and newspapers: Hao Chen received a telegram from Cai Tingkai, Shanghai Military Commander, at Hai Shi [10 PM] as follows: At 8:45 PM tonight, we received an ultimatum from Japanese Military Commander Ueda Kenkichi, which stated: "We earnestly desire to achieve our mission through peaceful and friendly means. Therefore, we notify your army of the following items: 1. Your army should immediately cease all combat activities and complete the withdrawal from the current front line by 7:00 AM on February 20th. Before 5:00 PM, starting from the line connecting the northwest end of the concession to Caojiadu Town, Zhoujiaqiao Town, and Pusong Town on the west bank of the Huangpu River, and from the line connecting Lan Nidu and Zhangjialou on the east bank of the Huangpu River, each should withdraw 20 kilometers north from the concession boundary, including the Lion Forest Fort, and remove all forts and other military facilities within that area, and not build new ones. 2. After your army begins to withdraw, the Japanese army will not conduct any shooting, bombing, or pursuit operations, except for aerial reconnaissance. 3. After your army completes the withdrawal from the front line, the Japanese army will send investigators with escort troops to the withdrawn area to confirm its implementation. These investigators will carry the Japanese flag for identification. 4. Your country should fully protect the lives and properties of Japanese nationals near Shanghai, including outside the withdrawn area. If this guarantee is not complete, the Japanese side will take appropriate measures. Also, all plainclothes teams should be effectively prohibited. 5. The protection of foreigners near Shanghai, including outside the withdrawn area, will be discussed separately. 6. Regarding the prohibition of anti-Japanese movements, the promise made by Mayor Wu to Consul-General Murai on January 28th should be strictly implemented. Regarding this matter, the imperial foreign affairs authorities will separately negotiate with the Shanghai administrative head of your country. If the above items cannot be implemented, the Japanese army will be forced to take free action against your army, and your army will be responsible for all consequences." At the same time, a telegram also arrived from Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, also receiving a similar ultimatum from the Japanese Consul-General, requesting instructions. We replied to Military Commander Cai and Mayor Wu, in essence, as follows: "Since September 18th of last year, when the Japanese army groundlessly started hostilities in Shenyang and occupied various parts of the Eastern Provinces, the people of our country have been filled with indignation at the rampant aggression of the Japanese army. Although the incident on the 18th of last month, when five Japanese monks were injured in Shanghai, was regrettable, the incident on the 20th of the same month, when Japanese ronin openly murdered and set fires near Mayushan Road, was even more serious than the assault incident. However, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, using that case as an excuse, made a stern demand to the Shanghai Municipal Government and dispatched a large number of warships, creating a threatening situation, and setting a deadline for a satisfactory response. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, considering the safety of the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai, had no choice but to compromise and reluctantly adopted the demand on the afternoon of the 28th, which was deemed satisfactory by the Japanese Consul-General. That evening, at 11:00 PM, the Japanese naval commander suddenly issued a notice to our Songhu garrison, stating that Japanese marines would depart for the Zhabei area and demanding that the garrison there withdraw immediately. Around 12:00 PM that night, they actually advanced troops to the Zhabei area. Our garrison had no choice but to resist in self-defense. However, our country has always adhered to the principle of maintaining peace, and we have sincerely accepted the ceasefire proposal made by the consuls of various friendly nations stationed in Shanghai on the 29th of last month, as well as the suggestion of the British and American consuls-general and military commanders on the 31st to withdraw troops from both sides, and the mediation plan of the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy on the 2nd of this month. However, the Japanese side either pretended to agree to a ceasefire on one hand while launching attacks on the other, or violated the original agreement without giving our country an opportunity to consider it, or ignored the painstaking efforts of various friendly nations and the goodwill of mediation, rendering the mediation plans of various countries a mere empty gesture. Considering this attitude and action, it is impossible not to recognize that the Japanese army has no sincerity in stopping the fighting and restoring peace. Furthermore, since the Japanese army started hostilities in Shanghai, using the pretext of protecting 30,000 Japanese residents, in addition to 5,000 marines, they have redeployed the Third Infantry Division of the army and have continued to reinforce troops. In addition, there are more than 40 warships, 3 aircraft carriers, more than 100 aircraft, field guns, heavy artillery, and countless other military equipment in Shanghai, launching attacks and bombings every day. As a result, the so-called protection of overseas Chinese has turned Zhabei and Wusong into ashes. Our country's educational, cultural, and medical institutions have been destroyed, and thousands of innocent civilians, flood victims, women, and children have been killed, and tens of thousands of other victims have been displaced. Our country has always strived for peaceful progress, so recently the ministers of the United States, Britain, and France came to Shanghai to mediate, and our country sincerely accepted it, hoping to implement a ceasefire based on the principle of simultaneous withdrawal of troops from both sides, so that the goodwill of the friendly nations' ministers would not end up in vain. However, the Japanese side has consistently lacked sincerity, not only failing to understand our country's and other countries' intention to mediate peace, but also making unreasonable demands on our country, making the situation in Shanghai increasingly serious. This is what our government deeply regrets. After investigating the Japanese document, the article requesting the cessation of combat activities, our national army has always adhered to the principle of self-defense. If the Japanese side can sincerely express its intention to stop the attack, our national army will never fight back. However, the withdrawal area refers to the territory under our country's jurisdiction, and our country's garrison has no reason to withdraw. As for the lives and property of Japanese nationals outside the withdrawal area, the Chinese side must fully protect them. China has always protected foreigners wherever they are in China, and this goes without saying. As for the statement that if the above protection is not complete, the Japanese side may take appropriate measures, it seems that they want to find an excuse to provoke trouble after our army withdraws, which the Chinese government cannot accept. Furthermore, regarding the prohibition of anti-Japanese movements, at a time when the Japanese army is provoking and seeking trouble in Chinese territory, the indignation of our people will naturally increase day by day. Unless Japan promptly withdraws its troops from Chinese territory and sincerely expresses its respect for China's sovereignty and territorial and administrative integrity, the so-called anti-Japanese movement of the Chinese people may not be eliminated. In short, the Japanese army, this time under the pretext of protecting the Shanghai concession, has turned the concession area into a base for invading our country's territory. All losses suffered by the people in both the Chinese and concession areas should be the full responsibility of the Japanese side. Based on the above reasons, our country finds it difficult to accept the various points stated in the Japanese document. If the Japanese army attacks again, our Songhu garrison will only follow government orders and resist with all its strength. The Japanese government should be responsible for all consequences. If the Japanese government can indeed order the Japanese army to immediately stop all aggressive actions and make a further sincere gesture, our country, in order to implement its original intention of maintaining peace, is still willing to consider it in good faith." The reply telegram has already been sent. Military Commander Cai and Mayor Wu will surely act in accordance with the government's intentions and handle the matter appropriately. The entire process is telegraphed to you, and the key points are stated as follows: 1. The brutality of the Japanese army and our country's painstaking efforts to maintain peace and justice, as described above, are seen and heard by all in China and abroad. 2. If the Japanese army continues its aggressive actions, our Songhu garrison will resolutely resist with the indomitable spirit it has shown for the past two weeks. 3. All our soldiers and civilians should know that although this military resistance is in a corner of Songhu, its impact is felt throughout the country. The country is an organic organization. All our soldiers and civilians should treat the self-defense actions in Songhu as if rescuing our own hands and feet, and should not ignore them. We must unite as a nation, with the greatest determination, for a long-term struggle, so that violence will not prevail. The Jiling decree is still valid, and we are in urgent need of assistance. Please understand and support us. Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e98">American Public Opinion Leans Toward Economic Blockade of Japan <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Senator Borah Advocates Caution (Washington) The evolution of government and public opinion regarding economic sanctions against Japan is noteworthy. The State Department and the White House have received numerous letters and telegrams stating that if Japan persists in its militaristic attitude, the United States should sever all relations with it. Among them are petitions from former Secretary of War Wilson and several university presidents, explicitly requesting that commercial relations with Japan be severed in consultation with the League of Nations. To date, the State Department seems to favor intervention more than the White House, but public opinion is deeply concerned about complications and has been unable to take action. Now that public opinion has changed, a more resolute attitude can be adopted. Some believe that this resolute attitude is essential, considering the special circumstances in Shanghai and that Japan's actions could completely destroy the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, arbitration treaties, and the peaceful situation. This view prevails in the United States, which believes that this situation is more serious than the current dispute. Congress still opposes economic sanctions, equating them with war, but with the majority of public opinion having changed, Congress's views may also change. In short, the declaration of economic sanctions must be approved by Congress and is difficult to implement immediately. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London Senator Borah published an article today opposing the suggestion of an economic blockade against Japan, believing that such a move could easily lead to the United States being forced to declare war on Japan. Borah advocated continuing efforts for a friendly settlement. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Officials here remained silent today regarding the Shanghai war. Secretary of State Stimson has received a report from Ambassador Johnson in China regarding the Shanghai situation and is studying it in detail, refusing to comment. Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement in response to Peck's criticism of his opposition to an economic severance with Japan. Peck, the former Army Chief of Staff during the European War and now a potential Democratic presidential candidate, Borah repeatedly argued that imposing economic pressure on Japan would be unwise, unfriendly, and challenging, as an economic severance with Japan would be tantamount to promoting a US-Japan war. He knew this argument came from the heart, but implementing it would be dangerous. (20th National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Japanese General Election <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Seiyukai Still Dominates New Parliament to Convene Next Month (Tokyo) The 61st Japanese Diet held a general election today. A total of 464 members were elected from 119 prefectures in mainland Japan, with each district electing three to five members. Taiwan, Korea, and other territories have no representation. All literate Japanese men aged 25 and over have the right to vote. Of the total 13,237,841 voters, about 70% went to polling stations to vote from this morning until evening. The results of some cities and districts will be announced tonight. It may take two or three days for more distant mountain areas to reach Tokyo. It is expected that the general outline will be known tomorrow night. The Seiyukai expects to win 225 seats. With the help of small parties and independents, it should be able to command a majority in the new Diet. However, even if the Minseito wins the election and reorganizes the cabinet, there is unlikely to be a major change in Japan's policy toward China, especially regarding the problems in the Three Eastern Provinces and the Shanghai Incident. Even the Japanese people are paying far less attention to the election than to the news of the Shanghai war. The election cost about 25 million Japanese yen, half borne by the parties and half by the voters. The new Diet will convene a special session around mid-March to discuss the budget and other important bills. (20th National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report at 8 PM tonight, the Seiyukai has gained an advantage in the general election. The current confirmed results are 86 seats for the Seiyukai, 55 for the Minseito, and 3 for the Labor Party. The Seiyukai is now confident that it can command a majority in the Diet, estimating that it can win 300 out of 466 seats. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Control All Agencies (Shenyang) According to a very reliable source tonight, the plan to announce the imperial system immediately after declaring Manchuria's independence has been postponed. According to recent speculation, a citizens' assembly will be convened first to elect Puyi as emperor, and then the imperial system will be announced to show that this move comes from the will of the people. The Eastern Three Provinces Gazette, run by Zhao Xinbo, carried an editorial yesterday advocating the construction of the Eastern Three Provinces Empire. It is said that Zhang Jinghui and Zhao Xinbo are dissatisfied with the current state, feeling that the Japanese are merely using them as puppets. The number of Japanese advisors in various agencies is increasing daily. The Northeast Transportation Committee has only a nominal Chinese chairman and secretary, and all other staff are Japanese. All departments of the Fengshan Railway Bureau have Japanese advisors. Recently, the Chinese government-run electrical plant needed to add a large batch of materials. As a rule, bids are invited to contract the work, but this time there was no bidding, and the order was directly placed with a certain Japanese trading firm. This alone is enough to prove Japanese control. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>The Sunday Observer Warns Japan London Political circles in London had not yet received news of a real war in Shanghai by noon today. The attitude of the government and senior military officials can now be regarded as a wait-and-see approach. There is no doubt that they are worried about recent developments. The Cabinet's special committee on Shanghai has not met since yesterday afternoon, but it can be convened at any time, day or night. In case of emergency, the entire Cabinet can also be convened immediately. According to sources at the highest levels, the Cabinet has been fully engaged since the outbreak of the Shanghai incident, dealing with the dual problems of the international relations of the Sino-Japanese conflict and the protection of British nationals in the Far East. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London An editorial in the Sunday Observer does not advocate Britain joining the war vortex. According to the newspaper, direct negotiations between China and Japan are the fastest way to establish a ceasefire. However, the newspaper also said that the United States and members of the League of Nations should reserve full powers to ensure that any agreement signed between China and Japan respects their own affairs and establishes a better foundation for maintaining international peace in the future in the Far East. The newspaper also issued a warning to Japan, stating that if countries are forced to promote China's organization, Japan's decline will be inevitable, starting with gradual decline and ending with no cure. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London The Sunday Times carried an article analyzing Britain's policy on the Sino-Japanese issue, saying that it would be foolish for Britain to take unilateral action. It would be a good long-term investment for British trade if Britain boldly announced its support for China. According to the author, the best approach for British interests is neutrality, mediation, and armed surveillance. Not following this policy is good at taking care of oneself, but not chivalrous. The best qualities of those in charge of the public concession and the British army will be tested by this. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The Börsen-Zeitung compared the Sino-Japanese War to the Hundred Years' War between England and France, where France eventually became a unified nation, resisting foreign enemies with all its strength and fully restoring its lost territory. The newspaper believes that there may be a similar development in the Far East, so even if the Japanese army occupies Shanghai, the war will definitely not end. The United States is now adopting a wait-and-see approach and will not intervene until Japan and China have been at war for a long time and are exhausted. The Vossische Zeitung also carried an editorial criticizing the situation in Shanghai, saying that even if the Japanese army wins in Shanghai, the war will not only not end, but will become even more intense.

Here, troops to be sent to Jiangxi have been carefully selected and preparations are underway for an immediate departure. He believes that a commander with prestige and experience should be chosen to lead the suppression, and elite troops should be drawn from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Guizhou, and other provinces, granting them real power and providing funds from the central government. Alternatively, permission should be granted to use surplus funds from the Guangdong Customs. Even if only a small contingent is sent from Guangdong and Guangxi, the central government must provide monthly subsidies to Guangxi to ensure sustainability. He requests that this proposal be forwarded to the central government for a decision. As for troops to resist Japan, there are many stationed along the Pinghan and Longhai railways, which can be mobilized, and the troops stationed in Jiangxi should not be withdrawn to avoid simply chasing the Communists around. Furthermore, Chen Jitang and Li Zongren replied to He Yingqin on the 18th, agreeing to Guangdong and Guangxi dispatching troops to southern Jiangxi to suppress the Communists, but requested that the central government's original troops stationed in Jiangxi not be withdrawn for the time being, and that the central government provide subsidies for the expenses of sending troops.

<p>To All Newspaper Offices: Since the Northeast fell and the Shanghai War broke out, the catastrophe of national subjugation is imminent. Only by gathering the strength of the entire nation and engaging in long-term resistance can we defeat the powerful enemy and save the nation from danger. However, the Communist Party members are taking the opportunity to wreak havoc and disturb our rear, which is a public enemy of the Party and the nation, and a great scourge of the nation. Ji Tang and others belong to the military and are responsible for protecting the people and defending the country. At this critical moment of life and death, how can we not have the ambition of self-defense? From now on, we will only write poems of common hatred, fear the warning of fratricide, and strive to resist Japan and suppress the Communists, to live up to the expectations of the people. Alas, the lofty aspirations of Yue Wu Mu still exist of eating the flesh of the barbarians while hungry. The great achievements of Huangfu Song in sweeping away the Yellow Turbans are admirable. The land is there, and we will not dare to change. This is a declaration. We hope you will understand.

<p>To All Newspaper Offices: Since the violent Japanese invaded our Northeast, the officers and soldiers of the 4th Army Group have been eager to defend the country. They have repeatedly sent telegrams requesting permission to assist Heilongjiang, swearing to set off. Zongren and Chongxi greatly admire the officers and soldiers of the army for rushing to the aid of the country in times of crisis. They have repeatedly pleaded to the central government to issue a clear order to transfer them, so as to facilitate the army's movement. At the same time, they have ordered the army to first gather in Quanzhou to await orders. Now that the army has been in Quanzhou for several days and the disaster is getting worse, in order to enable the army to quickly fulfill its urgent aid, the Acting Commander Wu Qiwu has been ordered to quickly lead his troops to continue forward, without staying in Quanzhou any longer.

<h3 id="e136">Important News from Japan <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Severity of the Osaka Landslide According to reports from various newspapers in Japan, a violent landslide suddenly occurred on the 5th of this month in the area of the Yan District of Jian'shang Village, Zhonghe Inner County, Osaka Prefecture. The ground in the entire area suddenly cracked in the shape of tortoise shells. The corner of the Dragon Field River was particularly severely fractured. The direction of the fracture line meandered south from the vicinity of Nagaoka at the eastern end of the Yan District until the eastern entrance line of the Guise Tunnel, and then crossed the Yamato River at a right angle, occupying an area of ​​about five or six miles wide. The cracks were all more than two feet wide. On the one hand, due to the drastic changes in the terrain, the ground suddenly rose directly to the east, with an average height of four feet. Other nearby areas are also gradually spreading. The houses of the people in the tortoise area completely collapsed, and the railway sleepers and tracks were bent and scattered, and the train could not operate. Since the 13th, vibrations have continued to be broadcast, with Nampyeong as the center. According to the report of the Director of the Hirano Meteorological Observatory, the ground of Fujii in Nara Prefecture has risen, and the riverbed of the Yamato River has changed, and the two banks are extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Phenomenon of Domestic Rice Famine The Japanese Asahi Shimbun reported that the supply of rice in mainland (Japan) this year is still short of 5 million koku. Minister of Agriculture Yamamoto has decided to purchase from overseas, but there is no sufficient survey of the current amount of rice stored in various prefectures. According to the report of the Dojima Rice Exchange Research Institute in Osaka, from January 31 to February 5, it decreased by 67,154 koku compared with the previous ten days. After six days, the number of reductions should be around 150,000. Apart from purchasing from Siam and Penang, there is no possibility of exporting Chinese rice for a while. As a result, rice prices have soared and people are panicked. At this extraordinary time, millions of people will be threatened by life. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to social legislation. Moreover, since the Shanghai issue occurred, the international political situation has changed significantly. If economic sanctions are implemented, what will be the future of the empire?</p>
