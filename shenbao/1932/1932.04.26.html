<p>時評</p>
<h3>日蘇果將不免於一戰乎（續）彬</h3>
<p>以資本主義國家與社會主義國家之根本對立反蘇之聯合戰綫誠有如昨評所述顯然日趨於擴大然而自其另一方面觀之則資本主義國際間内在之矛盾。亦日益深刻化此種内在之矛盾常爲反蘇聯合戰綫有力之牽掣。終於使各資本主義國家。互相觀望步調不能趨於一致。</p>
<p>即就目前之情勢而分析。法國之竭力拉攏歐洲各小國一方面固爲反蘇之準備。他一方面則又爲企圖取得歐洲之覇權然而此一企圖。則顯然與意大利發生直接之衝突。因此意大利乃竭力計劃妨礙法國全歐計劃之實現。而對法國站於防禦之地位。德國與奥國曾企圖締結關稅聯盟。而法國則使監督奥國工業百分之八十之維也納［克列齊安思大利］大銀行陷於破産。以强迫奥國放棄此種計劃對於德國亦利用財政勢力。迫使在經濟上與政治上。完全服從其支配。在東歐方面。法國雖亦竭力聯絡多腦河沿岸各戰敗國。擴大其勢力。然以法不願而且不能放棄其凡爾賽和約之支配系統。故其全部覇權之建立。亦因此而常多障礙至於美國。在各種重要利益上。亦與法國相衝突。而與意國有握手之趨勢。英國亦以忌嫉法國建立歐洲覇權之故與美特别表示親善。法爲牽制太平洋上之局勢。换言之。即以牽掣美國。則遠與日本秘密聯盟故自去年九一八日佔東北日美間之衝突。乃日益尖銳化。而興起日本軍國主義之可怖。較蘇聯之社會主義尤爲迫切之感蘇美聯盟之聲。乃一時甚囂塵。上而蘇聯則又運用其曲綫外交政策。與歐洲各小國互訂不侵犯條約以折散反蘇之聯合戰綫更復運用［點火政策］煽起各資本主義國内之階级爭鬥使其有所顧慮。以此種種之矛盾故故各資本主義國家。雖對蘇聯存根本之嫉視。然而其步趨終於未能一致。終於未能誠意結合。一九一八年聯合武裝干涉之失敗。亦即其先例也。</p>
<p>資本主義國家間之矛盾。旣日益尖銳。則日本之單獨對蘇作直接之衝突。顯然爲一種極其笨拙極其冒險之行爲。蓋今日蘇聯之强盛。已大異於帝　時代。往年日費金八萬萬元以取得西比利亞。其結果何若。日人今日固尚未容忘却。此種冒險行爲。旣於日不如强佔我東北之有特殊利益可圖。反之衝突之結果。兩敗俱傷。恰使美國折掌欣笑於旁。决爲日人所不肯爲。尤有進者日侵東北。再犯上海。以軍費之驟增。經濟上已陷於十分困頓之地位。設使日蘇戰爭爆發鉅大之軍費。更非彼所能支。再則東北今日義軍四起。日往返應戰已疲於奔命。無法保持其侵略之勝利。而韓人之復國運動。亦無日不　　以作。設使日蘇間而爆發戰爭。則東北之義軍與韓國之復國運勛者必然與蘇締結戰事同盟。此尤足以爲日本之大患以此數。因日本之顧忌旣多。而蘇</p>
<p>聯則又竭力退讓以避免戰事之爆發。僅作警告式之發言。使日本知難而退。故日蘇間之關係。無論惡化至若何程度。但其必不至於爆發戰爭。蓋爲吾人所可斷言。</p>
<p>然則目前日人對蘇聯之挑　行爲。固何爲乎。日上亦不過爲欲藉此以轉移列强對東北事件之視綫耳。如視此即謂日人已决意與蘇一戰。則誤矣。吾人敢斷言如欲戰其對手先爲美。第二次世界大戰之慘禍。或亦即以此而爆</p>
<p>發。關於此點吾人當另爲評以詳論之。</p>
<p>國聯今日非公開會議</p>
<p>西門今日准備出席</p>
<p>主席希孟多所顧慮</p>
<p>日政府不發新訓令</p>
<p>路透社二十五日日内瓦電云、十九國特委會、定明日午後三時三十分、舉行非公開會議、主席希孟、將陳述關於中日爭案討論之進步情形、</p>
<p>國民社二十四日日内瓦電云、國聯大會十九國委員會主席希孟、今日向中國</p>
<p>總代表顔惠慶保證、不論日代表接到政府回訓與否、十九國委員會將於星期二舉行公開會議、　　路透社二十四日日内瓦電云、英外相西門、因家庭關係、今日午後一時十分乘飛機返倫敦、擬於星期二日返此、俾出席於十九國特委會、研究中日爭點之會議、　　路透社二十五日日内瓦電云、此間日人謂努力勸喻中國在滬續開談判、現正在進行、故特委會當從缓開會、以待東京政府與此間日代表團意見能相脗合、國聯大會主席希孟、今仍以竭力遷就日人爲務、而一方面復須顧及特委會會員之情感、與中國代表團所提出早日開會之申請、故料今日當不致有何成就、</p>
<p>路透社二十五日東京電云、據某要津方面消息、政府不欲更變對十九國特委會之態度、故未以新訓令致日内瓦、政府對於英使蓋溥森調解滬案之努力、覺頗有成功希望、</p>
<p>日聯社二十五日東京電云、日本政府對於十九國委員會决議、堅持反對、並聲稱毫無讓步餘地、然頃又由日代表呈報其修正之折衷辦法、同時重光公使亦關於上海方面進行繼開停戰交涉之經過、有所请訓、外務省首腦部現正協議其對策、並鑑於日本原則的主張、愼重考慮應否接受問題、然大勢漸趨强硬主張、日本應照旣定方針、一路邁進之說頗有力、即謂日本出兵目的在於保僑、故撤兵事宜亦要自動開始、委員會旣然承認現地交涉、又復議决日本萬難承認之决議案、而使停戰交涉不能繼續、殊屬越權行爲、如委員會不理日本反對、召開公開會議、正式决定强請的决議、則日本與十九國委員會斷絕關係之外、無别方法、</p>
<p>日聯社二十四日日内瓦電云、十九國委員會議長希孟談中日間題、謂條文之解釋頗自由、要在實際之施行如何、不被决議案之文字束縳、而觀察其實質爲最緊要、國聯早已諒解日本立塲、决無抵觸日本憲法之事、</p>
<p>日聯社二十四日日内瓦電云、十九國委員會與日本代表團彼此對峙、交涉完全停頓、日總代表長岡因小國代表策動甚烈、苦心對付、連日與各方作非公式會議、力說日本立塲、請求諒解、日代表團業將秘書次長杉村陽太郎修改决議案第十一項之折衷辦法、請訓政府、然至今晨未得回訓、長岡本日會見希孟、關於正式</p>
<p>回答問題請求諒解、小國代表因日本接决議案之答覆未到、均表不滿、殊甚露骨、此等小國代表進行計劃、如委員會决議將因日本反對不能成立、則於五月一</p>
<p>日以前緊急召開特别總會、根基於大多數之票决、開陳纷爭事實、著作載有公正妥當之報告書、即行公表云、</p>
<h3>藍溥森郭泰祺今日乘機返滬</h3>
<p>中日談判僵局</p>
<p>英使折中辦法</p>
<p>國府覺可接受</p>
<p>羅郭兩氏表示</p>
<p>路透社二十五日南京電云、英使藍溥森</p>
<p>與郭泰祺、明日將乘蔣介石私用飛機由</p>
<p>京返滬、今日午後郭語報界、謂中日談判之僵局、仍繫於十九國特委會草案第十一項授權上海混合委員會决定日軍當撤退之時期一點、英使現已提出折中辦法、刻仍在國民政府考慮中、今晨英使曾偕郭泰祺·羅文幹·謁見蔣介石、有人以日本須先於排貨問題獲有諒解、而後始允在日内瓦讓步一節、詢諸郭氏、郭稱、排貨爲政治問題、目下尚未討論及之、又稱、圓桌會議問題、迄今尚未涉及、郭與藍使原擬今日乘船返滬、但以房間不敷、故今日僅郭之隨員乘船先行、</p>
<p>路透社二十五日南京云、今晚得悉、藍使爲謀滬案續開談判、向國民政府提出之折中辦法、經政府諸領袖考慮後、覺可接受、</p>
<p>南京專電、外息藍博森二十四五日先後與羅文幹汪兆銘會晤、于停戰會議發現新途徑、羅向藍表示、中國自始即願和平、迄未陗變、迭次向國聯呼籲、更可證明</p>
<p>中國信賴國聯和平公道、至滬會停頓、一則係中國尊重國聯决議、因日方提議超過國聯通知之限度、二則若依日方主張簽字、究對國人交代不下、明知延缓、雙方無益、苟日方能使國聯體面不損、中政府對國人交代得下、中國固甚盼滬案之早日得有結果、英使允再爲調停、提出辦法三項、中政府大體可以容納、和會重開、爲期不遠云、外人消息如此、又據郭泰祺談、英蓋使此來任務、係因滬會停開、</p>
<p>特趁此機會來京、晤我政府當局、商滬</p>
<p>事轉團辦法、並提出調停意見、今晨、藍</p>
<p>已與汪蔣會晤、我方對藍所提之意見、正在考慮中、本人赴英、尚無確期、定明日偕藍使同機返滬、滬會重開、須俟國聯持會公開會議議有辦法後、方可定期舉行、郭又談、日拒絕國聯持會决議草案、關鍵在第十一條所規定混合委會有權宣告日軍完全撤退之時機已至、及混合委會决議衹須多數同意即能有效、日方認此項規定、殊令其難堪、實則該决案第十一條、係確定混合委會之職權、十九國委員會中、多數贊同之、至混合委會决議、取决多數而不必全體一致、在滬停戰協定草案、第四項附件、混合委會辦事細則中、即有此規定、且經日代表同意、成爲已通過之定議、國聯特會僅根據滬會協定、重言以聲明之、日方今欲翻案、豈非自食前言、又日方認混合委會有權宣告日軍撤退之時機不管證明其師出無名、果何所爲而來、何所得而去、對其本國人民、似覺無以自圓其說、故多所　難、國聯及</p>
<p>參加滬會各友邦、現正各方設法、調解疏通、英使所提之調停意見、亦係期望雙方均能接受、惟我方總須以下損領土主權爲前提、不背國聯决案爲原則、至外傳日方擬以遏止抗日抵貨運動爲撤兵條件說、此項有關政治性質之事項、我决不談、政府亦絕不願在日軍未撤前、允許日方此項要求、即召開圓桌會議一事、在停戰會中亦始終未提及云（二十五日）南京專電、郭泰祺語記者、停戰會何時續開、須俟國聯公開會議通過特委會草案後、乃能决定、惟會議範圍、仍只限　戰撤兵、决不涉及政治性質之問題、郭本擬二十五日返滬、因事未果、定二十六日晨仍偕英使同乘飛機返滬（二十五日）</p>
<p>南京專電、英使藍溥森二十四日來京、以適値星期、未與當局接談、二十五日晨十時、由羅文幹陪往陵園謁蔣中正、談停戰會議之趨勢、及適當之解决辦法、十一時許回英　館、下午一時、應汪精衛之宴、對停戰會亦有所商談、聞英使擬於不背國聯决議案之範圍内、求一適當解决滬事之辦法已向蔣汪羅詳爲接洽、我當局尚在鄭重考慮中、（二十五日）</p>
<p>南京專電羅文幹·郭泰祺、廿五晨偕英藍使赴陵園晤汪蔣、對調停滬事問題、有意見交换、談一時餘、始辭出、正午汪在</p>
<p>外交官舍燳藍、並請羅·郭·英參贊秘書美領及徐謨·鄭天錫等陪座、席間對滬事復有一度研究、散席後、郭原定下午即乘怡和公司之湘和輪返滬嗣因該輪已無艙位、臨時改定二十六晨偕英藍使同乘蔣之自備飛機飛滬、郭之隨員及行李等件、則於二十五下午隨湘和輪先行、（二</p>
<p>十五日）</p>
<p>[P孫科招待報界</p>
<p>謂抗日爲我存亡關鍵</p>
<p>外交方針主聯絡美俄</p>
<p>黨外有黨許人民自由</p>
<p>中委孫哲生氏、近草擬一目前抗日救國綱領草案、經在報端披露、昨日下午四時、孫氏復在莫利愛路寓所、邀請各報記者</p>
<p>談話、將所擬抗日救國綱領、重行詳細解說、並徴求各記者意見、茲歸納孫氏之談話、分述於次、</p>
<p>籌備實施憲政孫氏首謂、今日中國欲求出路、惟在集中全國力量、一致長期抗日、蓋日本處心積慮、對我種種侵略行爲、完全欲以英亡印度之手段、施之於我、使我國民爲日本附庸、以貫澈其大陸政策、中國苟非抗日有效、則勢非自淪於印度第二之地位、屈服於日本不可、然抗日非今日政府單獨力量所能做到、縱令集中全國人才、另組政府、亦不能担負此鉅大責任、欲負澈抗日主張、惟由政府與全國人民合作、始能收最后之效果、現在中央不能領導全國民衆、無可諱言、而人民亦以不能參加政治、不能與政府合作、苟非政治易轍、全國團結、抗日勢無可能、故本人有抗日救國綱領之擬製、此綱領已於三數日前電陳中央、請予採擇、現尚未得覆、此綱領之要點、在籌備實施憲政、國民黨政綱最後之目的、亦爲憲政、惟須經過六年訓政手續、現在訓政已有四年、徒有其名、毫無成效可言、長此以往、時不我待、何以急難、故本人主張速行籌備憲政開始、不必再待訓政形式之終了、且地方自治未了工作、儘可於憲政開始後同時進行、不必待至其完成以後也、憲政旣成、則人民政府合一、抗日力量自必雄厚矣、</p>
<p>改革黨務意見孫氏又謂、</p>
<p>就黨務方面而言、近來黨之信用、實已完</p>
<p>全失掉、今欲補救、當有澈底改革之决心、其方法不外兩點、（一）不要國家養黨、須使黨員養黨、過去黨務之不良、即在黨費出諸政府、而黨員儼然成爲社會中之特殊階级、與前清八旗子弟彷彿、黨與民衆、遂成水火、且黨在各地、若太上政府、行政司法任意干涉、而地方官吏、亦因而纷纷營謀黨務上之勢力、爭奪黨委、蓋不如是蔣不克保其地位、此實國家養黨所造成之惡果也、（二）改良以後之黨務設施、黨部應秘密化、而無公開之必要、對黨員尤須加以充分訓練、</p>
<p>解釋黨内無派最近胡漢民先生在香港對黨外無黨·黨内無派兩語、有所解釋、惟本人以爲此兩語、實與事想相反、欲使黨内無派、必先黨外有黨、如國民黨以外各黨、在法律範圍内、應許其存在、共相競爭、則國民黨必能團結一致、實現黨内無派矣、此點至爲明顯、人均知極左者爲共産黨、極右者爲國家主義派、而國民黨介乎兩者之間、然左右二者、其政治主張、皆與三民主義有一部份相同、衹要其在法律範圍内活動、則當允許其存在、不黨一律目爲反動、</p>
<p>外交基本方針孫氏謂外交基本方針、以聯合世界上以平等待我之民族、共同奮鬥之旣定方針爲方針、此爲不易之論、蓋國際間之互相應付、多以利害之關係爲進退、凡利害相同、即因站在同一之利害立塲上、發生密切關係、現在與我國有以上之利害關係者、厥爲美國與蘇聯、美俄兩國、因其政體不同、在表面上觀之、似不能合作、其實不然、美國早已與蘇俄發生經濟關係、由經濟關係、自必連帶發生政治關係、最近美外交委員長波拉氏之主張、恢復美俄邦交等、此皆兩國間利害關係之吸引也、中國爲對日之主要角色、遠東之一切嚴重問題、均由中日間而起、日本現佔據東北後、復欲謀在西伯利亞東端、利用白俄、樹立與東三省相同之缓衝國、以爲日本之屏障、中國在此時、自應觀察最近國際情形、而實</p>
<p>行與美國及蘇俄等相聯絡、此外如英法諸國、亦與我國有相當之關係、應與作相當之聯络也、</p>
<p>胡氏贊同原則記者復詢孫氏、中央方面、及胡漢民對於此項提案、有無表示、孫氏謂、因該提案方於前數日送往南京、尚無來電表示、惟胡先生對此案、曾有來電表示、贊同原則、但對於憲法之頒佈、與地方自治工作時間之先後、及選與權限兩點、略有疑問、曾向余詢問、余當答以憲法頒佈·與地方自治工作時間、不必定列先後、不妨同時舉行、選舉權限、地方選舉、在村鄉舉行、職業選舉、在城市舉行、曾在職業團體選舉者、即不能在村鄉選舉、使人人得選舉一次、而不致發生重複之弊、</p>

<h3>德邦議會選舉國社黨獲勝利</h3>
<p>普邦突增至一百六十二席</p>
<p>希特勒可居操縱大局地位</p>
<p>造成全德棒喝主義化先聲</p>
<p>國民二十五日柏林電、此次普魯士議會選舉結果、國家社會黨到處大獲勝利、在議會内由六席一躍而增爲一百六十二席、即比一九一○年九月德國會總選舉時所得票數、亦幾增一倍、惟比諸日前改選總統第二次投票結果、則其票數未能各處皆有增加耳、此外則天主敎中央黨抵抗力亦稱不弱、雖原有七十一席今降爲六十七席、而比諸一九三○年總選舉票數、亦增加百分之六、共産黨亦能保持其位置、由五十四席增爲五十七席、但比一九三○年總選舉喪失票數百分之三、此外各黨類多喪失議席、而以人民黨由四十席减至六席、民主黨由二十一席降爲三席、喪失最多、</p>
<p>國民二十五日柏林電據政府發表、昨日普魯士選舉結果、今後新議會分野（一）右派各黨、計有國家社會黨·國權黨·人民黨·耶穌敎社會黨·漢諸佛黨等、共可占二百○二席、（二）韋馬聯合派、即操縱舊議會及組織現政府之天主敎中央黨·社會黨、及民主黨、共可占一百六十二席、（三）左派反對黨之共産黨五十七席、由此以觀、國家社會黨即能聯合右派各黨、而距國會議席之過半數仍缺九席、反之、若韋馬聯合派仍圖維持少數派内閣、則以共産黨常投反對政府票、又難異途同歸、國家社會黨足以制政府之死命、因此</p>
<p>今次普魯士選舉可謂造成一種無法可以解决之僵局、</p>
<p>國民二十五日柏林電普魯士選舉結果、今晨發表後、各黨立即開始表示其對於商組新政府談判所處之地位、國家社會黨首發宣言聲稱、普魯士邦新總理必須推選希特勒、凡彼準備擁護社會公道觀念與奮勉精神所産生的國家政策之各派、希氏將歡迎與之合作、一小時後、天主敎中央黨亦發宣言聲稱、苟非决意根據現行憲法、以服務國家謀公衆福利、並保證維持民治與基督敎文化者、該黨均願與之合作、但若有企圖造成一黨獨裁、妨碍國内之法律與秩序、更張賢智之外交政策者、該黨將全力反對、按該黨在新議會内居舉足輕重之地位、希特勒苟不能得其公開或默認之擁護、難得總理之望、又共産黨亦發宣言、謂昨日國家社會黨之勝利、乃社會黨政策依違兩可之天然結果、共産黨今後將集中其力量、吸收</p>
<p>社會黨工人、俾對於棒喝主義共作决死戰云、</p>
<p>國民二十五日史都德迦特電德國胡吞堡邦議會選舉、國家社會黨亦大獲勝利、據今晨子正所得初步總結果、大約國家社會黨可得二十席、天主敎中央黨二十席、社會黨十二席、農民黨八席、共産黨七席、耶穌敎社會黨三席、日爾曼國民黨三席、另兩小黨各得一席、惟國家社會黨雖增加議席二倍以上、但即與其他右派聯合、亦不能占多數、故料此邦共和派聯合内閣、或者仍可繼續云、</p>
<p>國民二十五日漢堡電昨日漢堡議會選舉、亦是國家社會黨一躍而爲最强政黨、社會黨雖向共産黨手中奪得議席不</p>
<p>少、但其席數仍不逮國家社會黨、至國家社會黨所得議席、多取諸左派各黨、今後漢堡新議會將有國家社會黨五十一席、社會黨四十九席、共産黨二十六席、民主黨十八席、國權黨七席、人民黨五席、天主敎中央黨二席、經濟黨一席、耶穌敎社會黨一席、</p>
<p>國民二十五日柏林電昨日普魯士議會選舉、實爲德國近世史上最重要時期之一、國家社會黨領袖希特勒、於總統選與　羽後、能否間接假普魯士政府開啓門户、以培植棒喝主義之第三帝國、將於此舉卜之、因此德國及全歐洲皆心旌懸懸、亟盼普議會選舉結果之答復此問題、但日前揭曉之各黨分野、希氏之敵人亦承認新政府中、希特勒可居操縱大局之地位、即將來希特勒與胡根堡携手組織聯合内閣、亦已爲人人意想中事、按普魯士在聯帮議會六十四席中、獨占二十六席、再有八萬警察足資運用、故一旦希特勒柄政後、將可左右聯邦政府、而爲造成全德棒喝主義化之先聲云、</p>
<p>國民二十五日柏林電今日政界及新聞界對於昨日議會選舉論調、雖見解各殊、而成有一相同之點、則四月二十四日可稱爲德國戰後慘痛史上一重要日期、乃一新時期之開始、惟此新時期之性質、則所見互異、保守派機關報晨報聲稱、即令議會陷於僵局、仍將昭示三端、（一）不能再以正當成不正當之方法、阻止國家社會黨之履行其使命、（二）社會黨失其普政府之最後根據地後、日就衰頽、（三）各小黨受經濟衰落打擊後、已失其重要、今後將處於無足重輕地位、最後並稱、此次足見德國人民準備與國家社會黨合作、組織普魯士新政府云、民主黨之柏林日報則</p>
<p>稱、不論今後事態變化若何、已足見大多數選民不滿意現行制度、但有一端不可忽視、即三分之二選民反對資本主義、蓋</p>
<p>共黨社會黨與國家社會黨均反對目前之</p>
<p>資本制度、此種制度已造成經濟混亂、又謂此次選舉結果、乃各國强加德國賠欵重担、及未能解救國際危局所産生、否則事態决不如此、故居人根據因果律、可謂此次選舉乃對於全世界之最後警告、或即可謂對於常識之最後訴告、倘未來之國際談判能傾聽此陳訴、則惡果或可倖免、否則若依然漠視、則所生結果、彼漠視此事者不應再責德國或國家社會黨負</p>
<p>其咎戾矣、</p>

<h3>最高法院報告</h3>
<p>牛蘭夫婦罪狀</p>
<p>有援助汀贛共黨活動確證</p>
<p>第二被告與第一被告同罪</p>
<p>並訓令蘇州高等法院起訴</p>
<p>路透社南京電云、數月前在上海公共租界被捕後移交中國當道之牛蘭夫婦一案、已由最高法院調查完畢、今晨中央日報登載該法院報告原文、據謂牛蘭夫婦兩犯、確與湘贛中國共産黨聯絡、並與近在上海槍斃之共産黨員向忠發曾有關係、最高法院已將此項報告書、送交蘇州高等法院、並訓令高等法院、依照此報告起訴、查所控諸節、内有兩被告希謀推翻現政府一條、如法院證明被告果犯此罪、則應處以死刑、</p>
<p>最高法院報告略稱、牛蘭一案、始於新加坡、該處英國當局曾以共産黨活動情形、報告上海公共租界工部局、上海捕房調查後、悉共黨以郵局信箱第二零五號、爲通信機關、旋復查出四川路第二三五號捕房仍隨時密查牛闌夫婦在滬行踪、遂知牛蘭曾用郵箱第二零五號、并以四川路二三五號爲辦事室、嗣後捕房復探悉牛蘭常至南京路第四十九號Ｃ字第卅號房間、去年六月十五日、牛蘭於該處被捕、捕房於搜查四川路及南京路兩處時、發現一法文短簡、即自稱牛蘭夫人者所草約、牛蘭於是日在該處相會、捕房遂派探至該處等候、牛蘭夫人因之被捕、捕房旋悉牛蘭夫婦、曾赁屋於愚園路及赫德路兩處房屋、曾經被抄發現銀行存欵收據總數約四萬元、但無共産黨文件、同時淞滬衛戍司令部、亦稱兩被告與新近槍斃之著名共産黨員向忠發有關、去年八月十四日、衛戍司令將兩被告解交南京軍事法庭、衛戍司令部後拘獲由新加坡到滬之黨員數人、並將其所捕之符大清解送南京、與牛蘭封質、十二月十七日軍事法庭判定被告活動地點、不在戒嚴區域之内、故該法庭無受理權、此案乃移交司法部、轉令蘇州高等法院辦理、迨蘇州高等法院正審查案卷時、中日戰事發生、司法部爲愼重起見、訓令蘇州高等法院將被告及案卷暫解南京、三月十八日最高法院開始調查、最高法院對於牛蘭被控密謀倾覆政府一條、表示同意、並詳述其理由、略謂搜獲文件、其中與共産有關者、佔百分之九十、最重要文件、係在南京路Ｃ字三十號房間搜獲者、除與菲列濱馬來朝鮮印度安南日本之共産活動有關外、其與中國境内共産活動有關者、在七十件以上、共分三種、一爲中國共産黨呈送總部之報告、二爲第三國際之訓令、三爲關於赤軍組織與在中國農工界開始活動之文件、由此文件觀之、南京路四十九號Ｃ字三十號房間之爲在華第三國際總部、已可確定、而居於該屋者之爲該總部主任、亦可推知、牛蘭辯稱、該辦公室係一名阿勒克斯者所租、其人爲研究德文之學生、業已離滬、又稱所有文件、係阿勒克斯所有、不過交牛蘭保管耳、詢以阿勒克斯何在、及詳細情形、則牛蘭不能發美滿答復、最高法院以爲可證明牛蘭與阿勒克斯實係一人者、計有五點、（一）據南京路四十九號司　者彭迦太言、牛蘭爲Ｃ字三十號房間之居住人、於一九三○年十二月二十五日在該處、自稱爲阿勒克斯、（二（屋主司賬員證明牛蘭即阿勒克斯、因牛蘭始終用阿勒克斯名字、親自付給租金、（三）牛蘭於一九三○年三月五日用阿勒克</p>
<p>斯名字、赴四川路和興成衣舗定購原色佛蘭　衣服、有賬可稽、（四）該屋内鐵箱三個、其中一個置美金一千八百元、牛蘭能知上述鈔票置於何箱、但竟不承認知悉所獲共産文件之内容、（五）筆跡專家證明牛蘭筆跡、與所獲文件上筆跡相同、</p>
<p>觀此事實、牛蘭之居住於南京路四十九號Ｃ字三十號房間·及被獲文件之爲牛蘭所有、已可確定、至於阿勒克斯者、並無其人、顯係牛蘭僞名、牛蘭供稱、渠於一九三○年三月間來華、爲柏林某商行代表、但渠從未作何買賣、此層牛蘭亦自承不諱、牛蘭又供稱、渠係敎員、敎授法德文功課、但詢以學生何人、則僅以阿勒克斯與租住赫德路六十六號業已離滬之另一人爲答、查牛蘭僅有此簡單職業、而辦公室竟有四所、一在四川路二三五號、一在南京路四九號、一在愚園路鴻益坊七四號、一在赫德路六六號、牛蘭且用郵局信箱八個、並在中國無線電局登記電信住址四處、近來中國各處搜查共産黨機關、發現牛蘭與</p>
<p>中國共黨活動確有關係、尤以湘贛兩省赤軍爲甚、牛蘭以財力接濟之、並指揮之、是以被告有傾覆現政府之行爲、</p>
<p>最高法院之報告續稱、無論被告男女二人、是否正式夫婦、但第二被告來華之目的、係與牛蘭相</p>
<p>同、并曾協助牛蘭進行共産工作、企圖傾覆中國政府、已屬明顯、捕房雖未於第二被告住屋内、發現任何共黨文件、然當第二被告入南京路四十九號Ｃ字三十號房間目覩牛蘭被捕時、即謀脫逃、并稱渠與牛蘭素不相悉、係誤入是號房間、關於第二被告之國籍問題第二被告屢易供詞、未能確定其究係何國人民、但於牛蘭辦事室内、捕房曾發現法文之來函一封、係前年五月二十七日由新加坡寄來、該函雖用暗碼、然係共黨人員寄來之報告、自屬無疑、該函之筆跡、與南京路四十九號Ｃ字三十號房間内所抄出之法文短簡相同、第二被告即自稱牛蘭夫人者所進行之工作、係與牛蘭相同、旣屬明顯、則渠所應受之處分、亦當與牛蘭相等云云、（四月二十四日）</p>

<h3>辦法說</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>世間事只要肯辦。總有辦法。除却將男作女長生不死等類外。决不會有没辦法的事。凡說没辦法三字。實不肯辦之一代名詞。試想世界綿延幾萬千年。何啻恒河沙數的事。即謂没辦法。没辦法的辦法。便是辦辦法。仍是有辦法。譬如禪家說不立文字。即立文字也。辦法誠有好壞之不同。須知好壞是辦法之結果。不能謂</p>
<p>結果好爲有辦法。結果壞爲没辦法。以此推論。則没辦法之名詞。當然不能成立。蓋有一事必有一辦法也。更淺言之。事非一人之事。即辦法非一人之辦法。如果别人以爲没辦法。而我認爲有辦法。是以我的有辦法。打倒人的没辦法。我便負起全責去辦。此一辦法也。有時我覺得没辦法。而别人都說有辦法。是我的没辦法。被人家有辦法打倒。便應知趣。讓别人家去辦。此又一辦法也。再不然。無我見。無人見。人我合一。知行合一。大家從没辦法中求有辦法。同心合力的辦。此又一辦法而辦法之最好者也。最壞的是我自己没辦法。却一味禁制别人不准有辦法。這眞呌没法辦了。但就事論斷。仍不是没辦法。作辦法說。</p>
<h3>忠義之和尚</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>明嘉靖間。倭寇東南各省。由乍浦而進犯嘉興。將沿途所擄之婦孺財物。藏匿於距嘉興西門三里許之茶禪寺。以資取樂。旋奉令復寇桐鄉。拔幟時。將婦孺禁閉寺内密室。派卒監守。寺僧妙諦在誦經時。聞婦孺哭泣聲甚慘。乃動救世之念。遂沽酒以餉守卒。俟其醉。盡釋婦孺。衆感其德。勸同遁。僧恐守卒醒後。無人說謊。必被追趕。仍難脫險。願犧牲一己以救衆人。堅令速逃。衆乃四散。少頃。守卒醒後。見婦孺均逃。追問原委。妙諦謊稱頃見韋陀以鞭擊門。盡放諸人。佛法無邊。難以抵禦。守卒疑信參半。因宿醒初醒。體倦無力。不克遠追。遂拘妙諦以待命。旋往攻桐鄉之頭目回。追詢此事。知妙諦所爲。乃將其縳於寺外石坊上。先令各兵發箭亂射。并積薪以焚其屍。致石坊上留有血影。迄今三百餘年。影仍未退。</p>
<p>民國十五年。危道豐任嘉興知事時。慕其忠義。恐年久事湮。特爲之立碑以紀其事。近因閘北漢奸助日以欺同胞。何今人不若古人如是。爰將妙諦義舉表而出之。以勵民衆。</p>

<p>蘇俄政府所設立的航空學校中。女學生占百分之二十。每校大抵如此。將來一定有不少女飛行家。造成驚人的偉業。　　英國培德福歇埃Ｂedfordshire地方。有人登明捕鼠的新法。他在捕鼠機中。放一面小小的镜子。竟在一星期間捕到了三十頭鼠子。</p>
<p>德國茂尼克Ｍunich城中。有一個市民。在一張普通明信片的兩面。抄寫兩首詩。和一篇八千一百字的中篇小說。其字跡之渺小。可想而知。誦讀時。非用顯微鏡相助不可。</p>
<p>倫敦現有四百四十五家大影戲院。共備有三十八萬四千八百五十個座位。每天可容納三十八萬四千八百五十人前去看影戲。據敎育委員會調查之下。無論那一種影片。對於兒童並無何等實際上的弊害。所以平日兒童們儘可多看影戲。</p>

<p>通信器原爲軍隊中的命脈。在軍事上大约用人與電傳導。或用犬與鴿送達。而且不外目視與耳聽二種。目視的通信法中。有回光通信機。就是因光的</p>
<p>明滅而收發。通信的距離。依照型式有畫夜的分别。現今通信機關的主體。多依電力方法。如有線電報電話。無線電報電話。光電話。電送攝影。電送實景ＴeleVision等。有線通信器。以小型輕量而堅固的爲主。近來的電報機。有顯字機·重通信機·印刷電報機·自動電報機·及高周波電報機等。電話機則以震動式與電鈴式爲主。還有高周波電話機。長距離電話機。咽喉電話機等别。咽喉電話機。裝置于防毒面具或裝在戰車内。以防避雜音的騷擾。即套在咽喉的聲帶部分送話的。軍</p>
<p>用無線通信器。可分固定式地上部隊用與航空用三種。此次滬戰。日軍使用眞空管式無線電機。分配于前線陣地。以聯絡戰地通信。又在領事館與司令部。裝設長波式短波式。與前線各陣地相聯絡。在飛機上所裝的航空無線電能信器。爲大正十三年眞空管式機。惟此機須與砲兵協同。庶幾對于觀測射擊偵察上。收效亦大。近年來無線電學。日形進步。新發明短波長超短波長。于是軍用機上所用的通信機。亦大改良了。</p>
<p>其他屬於軍用的器械甚多。如軍艦魚雷地雷防彈具等。不勝枚與舉。今因限子篇幅。均略。將來俟拙著現代科學戰爭論脫稿後。再公於世。（完）</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（三五）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齊主人</p>
<p>第五回負義絕交不幸招逢豪客怒關情定策最難消受美人恩</p>
<p>安大奎派隨軍照料。順便掛了幾天號回家來看望。那知這一天正在家裏閒住著。忽地寨門外一個守衛的團丁。帶進個高大的漢子來。說是牛黑風派他來帶一個口信准於今天下午。牛黑風因路過寳莊之便。要親來拜見安大爺和安三爺。安大奎聽得這個消息。驀然心懷鬼胎。就與安大成秘密商議道。牛黑風這厮好大膽。這裏不遠就駐有我們勦匪的軍隊。他跑到我們這裏來幹什麽。但他旣已來到。我們又不能不接待他。頂好衹由你去敷衍他好了。我現在是屬於勦匪軍隊的一方面。與他見面有許多不便。不如我立刻就回營去。躲他一躲。說罷。他急急忙忙騎着馬就跑了。幾個鐘頭後。牛黑風帶了十來個便衣　囉。果也准時光降。在</p>
<p>寨門外下了坐騎。對著道旁迎候的安大成。抱著拳唱了個肥喏。便一同携手進寨。直來到安大成住宅的大客廳上。牛黑風向左右望了望。劈頭便問道。三哥呢。安大成稍一沈吟。牛黑風又哈哈發笑道。大哥。您不用含糊啦。三哥幹著軍界上的事我早已得著信了。這有什麽要緊。難道我們多年要好的弟兄。爲了這點關係。就再</p>
<p>也不見面了嗎。安大成忙陪笑道。實不相瞞。老三是的確同家來過。只是今天您打發來送信的人。遲到了一步。他在黎明時分早已走了。他在外邊混飯。原不過是那麽一回事。何至於就有隔閡。好在有我在家招待您。也是一樣。就請您别見外罷。說過這些客氣話後。當即備下一桌上好酒飯。欵待這位豪客。席間。牛黑風談笑風生。又與安大成說了許多閒話。無非夸張他如何本領高强。絕不把即些飯桶般的勦匪軍隊看在眼裏。他要高興訪尋朋友。就得聽憑他自由來。誰也不能把他怎樣。及酒飯用罷。牛黑風旋即起身告辭。安六成未便强留。仍親身送到寨外而别。</p>

<h3>上海敎育界的救國工作如何</h3>
<p>— 觀</p>
<p>海外屢傳來消息；［美國大學校長，爲了維持人道正誼，表同情於我，發起約集數十餘萬人來抵制日貨，日本中小學校學生，每人捐錢一角，去購愛國飛機，］我聽到了，心中衹覺砰砰的跳動、不知如何是好，人有同心，我想和我具有同樣感觸的人，一定不少罷！　　現在上海不是已經停戰了麽？學校照常上課，隆隆砲聲，久不聽見，似乎大家覺得没有甚麽事了，可是想一想看，我們民族所託命的國家，現在是甚麽樣子呢？土地照常被人强佔住，北方同胞三千萬，宛轉哀號於敵人鐵蹄之下，已閱半年，南方人民五六十萬，流離顚沛，無家可歸，亦逾兩月，同胞被敵人慘殺的，斑斑碧血，染春草而未乾，被敵人姦淫的，苦苦呼號，問蒼天而不應，繁盛市塲，已成瓦礫，敵人國旗，隨風飄揚於我國境内，大砲之聲雖不聞，而一切目所覩耳所聞，獨能無動於心乎？</p>
<p>一個國家，要想永久生存於大地，一定要把民族生命力好好保存着，培養着，不但不可讓他枯萎，還要求他繁榮，民族生命力在何處表見呢？，當然是民族的愛國心了，不識字的老百姓，愛國心不甚發達，那是因爲未受過國民敎育的原故，不能去怪他，若是敎育界的知識分子，也是暮氣沉沉，對於國事，漠不關心，則民族生命力的源泉，就要枯竭了，那才眞是萬分危險哩！</p>
<p>北方有賣唱的女子，名呌李想容，他每次登壇，未敲大鼓，先要有一段簡單演說，勸人愛國救國，聽衆十分感動，可憐這一點極可寳貴的生命力，倒反在這個地方湧現出來，那末，作育人才的敎育機關，怎樣呢？難道敎育界的知識分子，反不及一個賣唱的弱女子麽？</p>
<p>願我敎育界同人，速速奮起，快快團結，用我餘時，竭我餘力，努力從事救國工作，倘若仍是衹管敎書，不管敎人，衹知有學校，不知有國家，並且下課以後，一切不問，出校以後，一概不管，得暇還是照舊閒游，照常娱樂，這</p>
<p>樣，再從何處去𤀹發民族新生命力淵源呢？請看，遼省各學校，已經有外國人來做指導員了，已經强迫用外國人編的敎科書了，這是剷除民族生命力的最毒方法啊！我敎育界同人，對此又作如何感想呢？欲救國家，應該從速，遲則雖欲救，恐怕也來不及了。</p>

<h3>灰慶的重要</h3>
<p>— 亞羅</p>
<p>平常人覺得灰慶是無用亦無害的東西、有常識的人便覺得牠是有害的、那</p>
<p>裏知道科學家會覺得牠是很有用處、與人類很有益處的東西、牠的重要雖不能和空氣相比、至少能比空氣次要的東西相抗、不錯、塵灰是微菌的寄生物、是傳染病媒播物、但是牠也是美之神、是雨·霧·露·雲的創造主、</p>
<p>碧藍的天空、五光十色、燦爛煇華的落日、靑綠的海洋、都是何等的美麗啊！</p>
<p>、但是假使是没有塵灰的話、我們那裏會有這種眼福呢、要曉得、這就灰塵之所賜、</p>
<p>試以圓筒兩隻、一注以平常的空氣、一注以純凈無纖塵的空氣、然後把光線射入去、我們就可以看見前一筒内光耀非常、反之後一筒内則黑暗如溙、一毫莫辨、此時如果把前者空氣慢慢放進後筒内、那麽後一筒内便漸漸發碧藍光、隨着塵灰的加多塵料的加粗、而至於變成純白無色如平常空氣、</p>
<p>由此可知空中色彩的不同、完全由於空中塵灰的多寡、塵粒的細粗、塵少塵細則色彩淡、塵多塵粗則色彩深、頭上天空、因距地遼遠、塵少且細、自然是碧綠可愛、升日落日、色彩紅黄、燦爛悅目、因其光線達於人眼時、須經過地平線塵灰較多較粗的低空、不過假使您上至比落日的更高的地方、由上看下時、那麽落日四週也是藍靑色或淡黄色的、所以我們可以說落日色彩的不同、因由於塵灰之多寡和塵料的粗細、亦由於觀者地位高下之不同、</p>
<p>海洋多深碧色、因海洋有多量極細微的塵粒、和許多死在海中極微細的有機生物的骨灰、火山噴發下來的土灰、河</p>
<p>中流出去泥灰、及流星灰等、</p>
<p>假使灰慶僅僅有這種美的作用、我們實不必在此替牠捧塲、說牠怎樣重要、</p>
<p>因牠還有一種令我們非注意不可的作用存在着、</p>
<p>試以玻璃管二個、一個管中的空氣是未經濾淨的平常空氣、一個管中的空氣是已經用棉花濾淨毫無灰塵的、然後把水蒸氣扣傾入管中、於是前管内就會充滿如雲狀凝結的蒸氣、後客内則依然透明、這就是表明在有灰塵的空氣中水蒸氣冷却時、是會凝結成雲成露或成雨的、否則便不會凝結、依然是透明體、（雲的濃厚程與塵粒的數目成正比例）空中</p>
<p>因由日光蒸發海水或其他地面的水而充滿水蒸汽時、設空中没有一點灰塵被牠凝結、牠衹有歸集在山頂、或森林中樹葉上、這種作用變得急速、而水蒸汽積集得很多時、那麽衹有變成傾天蓋地的暴雨降下地面、結果不是傷人、便是害物、一方面因蒸汽都積聚高處、地方稍低的土地便乾燥異常、不能耕種、這就是空中不</p>
<p>灰塵的害處、</p>
<p>不過灰塵太多了、實在也不是我們所希求的、因爲灰塵多、則雲霧多、雲霧多則一切生物受日光的時候少、日光一少、土地植物的生産力也就减少了、近一</p>
<p>二百年間倫敦工業發達工廠林立、灰塵加多、雲霧亦日增、因此農事的生産力大大减少、就是這個綠故、</p>
<p>東西南北</p>
<h3>故鄉</h3>
<p>— 張人</p>
<p>許久不回家了，想起德詩人施篤姆的話來·懷鄉的念頭便分外迫切，因此在四月二日，借了掃墓的美名，就搭輪還鄉。</p>
<p>三日晨到了Ｅ地，故鄉無恙，河山若含笑相迎，在敵騎縱横的鐵啼下，將來能否保持這一片干凈土，眞令人不敢自信了！</p>
<p>在家裏，好幾天的光陰都平凡地但是很安靜地過去。</p>
<p>十日那天，因爲有些事，想到Ｗ埠去。從Ｅ地到Ｗ埠，乘小輪要二三小時的時間。我因爲登輪很早，便倚窗閒望，賞覧那靑山綠水的景色。不久便絡續來了好幾個搭客，内中有一個少年在我對面坐下，看報消遣。當我正在對兩隻瘦得像癆病鬼一般的兵艦，興無限的感概時，外面走進一個西裝靑年，衣上别了一個徽章，在少年旁邊坐下以後，便以手擊桌，高聲呌着：</p>
<p>［喂！泡茶！］</p>
<p>茶房連忙展開笑臉替他泡好了茶，並且殷勤地絞了一把手巾。</p>
<p>船開了，帳房來賣票，挨到西裝少年，便抬頭向帳房一望，說道：</p>
<p>［公事差遣，買什麽票？］</p>
<p>帳房有經騐地回答：</p>
<p>［買張半票吧！先生］</p>
<p>西裝少年似乎有些發怒了，立了起來，惡聲地道：</p>
<p>［什麽？不買怎樣？到了Ｗ埠，你同我一道到部去好了。］</p>
<p>帳房很機警，恐怕得罪了什麽一要人，］連忙道：</p>
<p>［好說，不買也可以，也可以，］說畢就走了。</p>
<p>船艙裏的空氣，似乎不如平時那麽</p>
<p>的靜和，西裝靑年走來走去，口裏吹着時行的小曲，大衆都有點厭煩的樣子，却又敢怒而不敢言。</p>
<p>第一會，他間看報的少年借報，少</p>
<p>年借給了他，他看完以後，覺得有些疲乏，想打瞌睡，看見少年有個包袱，便要問他借來當枕頭。少年本來在借報的時候已經有些不願、問他借包袱，就立刻拒絕，說：</p>
<p>［請向别人借吧］</p>
<p>這在西裝靑年看來，似乎是一件意外的事。一個人乘船可以不買票，當然是個特殊階级的人物，特殊階级的人所說的話，可以反抗、那還了得！他又跳了起來說：</p>
<p>［不借麽？好！這顯然裏面有違禁品，打開來檢查！</p>
<p>少年的情感已經氣憤得不可抑止，也立了起來說：</p>
<p>［你不要弄錯了，你以爲機關上當了差使，就可以狐借虎威的欺凌人民了麽？國難當前，我們正應該團結一致，力禦外侮，你却還要仗勢魚肉鄉民，你的良心何在？何况你有什麽權什麽理由可以檢查我呢？</p>
<p>這正是我們大家要說的話，不由都齊聲說：</p>
<p>［對呀！｝</p>
<p>西裝靑年受了打擊，又因衆怒難犯，便喊道：</p>
<p>［好，好！到了Ｗ埠，非呌警察拉你去不可［一面說一面走出去了。</p>
<p>這時天色暗淡，細細的雨絲不絕地降着，船上的機聲也軋地合奏着一種異樣的音調。</p>
<p>Ｗ埠已經不遠了。</p>

<h3>Will Japan and the Soviet Union Inevitably Go to War? (Continued) Bin</h3>
<p>The fundamental opposition between capitalist and socialist countries, and the anti-Soviet united front, is, as mentioned in yesterday's commentary, clearly expanding. However, from another perspective, the internal contradictions among capitalist countries are also deepening. These internal contradictions often powerfully restrain the anti-Soviet united front, ultimately causing the capitalist countries to watch each other and fail to coordinate their actions.</p>
<p>Analyzing the current situation, France's vigorous efforts to win over various small European countries are, on the one hand, preparations against the Soviet Union, but on the other hand, they are also attempts to seize hegemony in Europe. However, this attempt obviously clashes directly with Italy. Therefore, Italy is doing its utmost to obstruct the realization of France's pan-European plan and is adopting a defensive posture against France. Germany and Austria once attempted to conclude a customs union, but France caused the Vienna [Creditanstalt], which oversaw 80% of Austrian industry, to go bankrupt in order to force Austria to abandon this plan. It also used financial power against Germany to force it to completely submit to its control economically and politically. In Eastern Europe, although France is also striving to connect with the defeated countries along the Danube River to expand its influence, because France is unwilling and unable to abandon its Versailles Treaty-dominated system, the establishment of its overall hegemony is often hindered. As for the United States, it also conflicts with France on various important interests and tends to shake hands with Italy. Britain also shows particular friendliness to the United States because it is jealous of France's establishment of European hegemony. France, in order to contain the situation in the Pacific, in other words, to contain the United States, has long secretly allied with Japan, so the conflict between Japan and the United States since the September 18th Incident of occupying Northeast China has become increasingly acute. The sense that the rise of Japanese militarism is more urgent than the socialism of the Soviet Union has led to loud calls for a Soviet-American alliance. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, is using its serpentine diplomatic policies to sign non-aggression treaties with various small European countries to break up the anti-Soviet united front, and is also using a [scorched earth policy] to stir up class struggles within various capitalist countries, causing them to have concerns. Because of these various contradictions, although the capitalist countries have a fundamental jealousy of the Soviet Union, their steps have ultimately failed to be consistent and they have failed to combine sincerely. The failure of the joint armed intervention in 1918 is also a precedent.</p>
<p>Since the contradictions among capitalist countries are becoming increasingly acute, Japan's independent, direct conflict with the Soviet Union is clearly an extremely clumsy and extremely risky act. Today's Soviet Union is far stronger than the Tsarist era. What were the results of spending 80 million yuan a year to acquire Siberia in the past? The Japanese have not yet forgotten this. This kind of risky behavior has no special benefits to be gained, unlike occupying our Northeast. On the contrary, the result of the conflict would be that both sides are hurt, which would make the United States happy to profit from it, which the Japanese would definitely not be willing to do. Moreover, Japan's invasion of Northeast China and its re-aggression in Shanghai have already put it in a very difficult economic position due to the sharp increase in military spending. If a Japanese-Soviet war breaks out, the huge military expenses would be unbearable for it. Furthermore, today, righteous armies are rising up in Northeast China, and Japan is exhausted from fighting back and forth and unable to maintain its victory of aggression. The Korean restoration movement is also brewing every day. If a war breaks out between Japan and the Soviet Union, the righteous armies in Northeast China and the restoration activists in Korea will inevitably conclude a wartime alliance with the Soviet Union. This is especially enough to be a major concern for Japan. Because Japan has many concerns, and the Soviet Union is doing its best to back down to avoid the outbreak of war, only making warning-style speeches to make Japan back down. Therefore, no matter how much the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union deteriorates, it will definitely not lead to the outbreak of war, which we can assert.</p>
<p>So, what is the current provocative behavior of the Japanese against the Soviet Union for? The Japanese are only trying to use this to divert the great powers' attention from the Northeast Incident. It would be a mistake to think that the Japanese have decided to fight the Soviet Union. We dare to assert that if it wants to fight, its first opponent will be the United States. The disaster of World War II may also break out because of this. We should write another commentary on this point to discuss it in detail.</p>
<p>League of Nations Non-Public Meeting Today</p>
<p>Simon Prepares to Attend</p>
<p>Chairman Hymans' Concerns</p>
<p>Japanese Government Does Not Issue New Instructions</p>
<p>Reuter's, Geneva, 25th: The Committee of Nineteen will hold a non-public meeting at 3:30 PM tomorrow. Chairman Hymans will report on the progress of the discussions regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 24th: Chairman Hymans of the League of Nations Assembly's Committee of Nineteen assured the Chinese Chief Delegate Yan Huaiqing today that regardless of whether the Japanese delegate receives instructions from his government, the Committee of Nineteen will hold a public meeting on Tuesday. Reuter's, Geneva, 24th: British Foreign Secretary Simon returned to London by plane at 1:10 PM today due to family matters. He plans to return here on Tuesday to attend the meeting of the Committee of Nineteen to study the Sino-Japanese dispute. Reuter's, Geneva, 25th: Japanese sources here say that efforts are underway to persuade China to continue negotiations in Shanghai. Therefore, the Committee should delay its meeting to wait for the opinions of the Tokyo government and the Japanese delegation here to coincide. League of Nations Assembly Chairman Hymans is still doing his best to accommodate the Japanese, while also having to take into account the feelings of the members of the Committee and the Chinese delegation's request to hold a meeting as soon as possible. Therefore, it is expected that there will be no achievements today.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, 25th: According to sources in important positions, the government does not want to change its attitude towards the Committee of Nineteen, so it has not sent new instructions to Geneva. The government feels that the efforts of British Ambassador Lampson to mediate the Shanghai case have some hope of success.</p>
<p>Japan News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: The Japanese government insists on opposing the resolutions of the Committee of Nineteen and claims that there is no room for compromise. However, the Japanese delegate recently submitted a revised compromise plan. At the same time, Minister Shigemitsu also requested instructions regarding the progress of the continued armistice negotiations in Shanghai. The leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are currently discussing countermeasures and are carefully considering whether to accept the issue, based on Japan's principles. However, the trend is gradually becoming stronger, and there is a powerful argument that Japan should move forward along its established policy, that Japan's purpose in sending troops is to protect its nationals, so the withdrawal of troops should also begin automatically. Since the Committee has acknowledged the local negotiations, it has again resolved a resolution that Japan can hardly accept, making it impossible for the armistice negotiations to continue, which is an act of overreach. If the Committee ignores Japan's opposition and convenes a public meeting to formally decide on a forceful resolution, Japan will have no other choice but to sever relations with the Committee of Nineteen.</p>
<p>Japan News Agency, Geneva, 24th: Committee of Nineteen Chairman Hymans spoke about the Sino-Japanese issue, saying that the interpretation of the articles is quite free and that the most important thing is how they are actually implemented, not to be bound by the words of the resolution, but to observe its substance. The League of Nations has long understood Japan's position and will never violate the Japanese constitution.</p>
<p>Japan News Agency, Geneva, 24th: The Committee of Nineteen and the Japanese delegation are facing each other, and negotiations have completely stalled. Chief Japanese Delegate Nagaoka is struggling to deal with the strong agitation of the delegates from small countries. He has been holding informal meetings with various parties for days, trying to explain Japan's position and asking for understanding. The Japanese delegation has submitted to the government a compromise plan to amend Article 11 of the resolution, modified by Secretary-General Sugimura Yotaro. However, no instructions have been received as of this morning. Nagaoka met with Hymans today to request understanding regarding the formal response. The delegates from small countries have expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that Japan's response to the resolution has not arrived, and they are being very blunt. The delegates from these small countries are pursuing a plan that if the committee resolution cannot be established due to Japan's opposition, a special general assembly will be urgently convened before May 1st. Based on a majority vote, the facts of the dispute will be presented, and a report that is fair and appropriate will be written and immediately published.</p>
<h3>Lampson and Guo Taiqi Will Return to Shanghai by Plane Today</h3>
<p>Deadlock in Sino-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>British Ambassador's Compromise Plan</p>
<p>National Government Finds It Acceptable</p>
<p>Luo and Guo Express</p>
<p>Reuter's, Nanjing, 25th: British Ambassador Lampson and Guo Taiqi will return to Shanghai by Chiang Kai-shek's private plane tomorrow. Guo told the press this afternoon that the deadlock in the Sino-Japanese negotiations still hinges on the point in Article 11 of the Committee of Nineteen's draft resolution that authorizes the Shanghai Mixed Commission to decide when the Japanese troops should withdraw. The British Ambassador has now proposed a compromise plan, which is still under consideration by the National Government. This morning, the British Ambassador, accompanied by Guo Taiqi and Luo Wengan, met with Chiang Kai-shek. When asked about the fact that Japan must first obtain an understanding on the issue of anti-Japanese boycotts before it is willing to compromise in Geneva, Guo said that boycotts are a political issue and have not yet been discussed. He also said that the issue of a round table conference has not been touched upon so far. Guo and Ambassador Lampson originally planned to return to Shanghai by ship today, but because there were not enough rooms, only Guo's staff took the ship first today.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Nanjing, 25th: It was learned tonight that the compromise plan proposed by Ambassador Lampson to the National Government in order to continue negotiations on the Shanghai case is considered acceptable by the government leaders after consideration.</p>
<p>Nanjing Special Dispatch: Foreign sources say that Lampson met with Luo Wengan and Wang Zhaoming on the 24th and 25th, respectively, and found a new path for the armistice conference. Luo expressed to Lampson that China has been willing to make peace from the beginning and has not changed. Repeated appeals to the League of Nations can further prove China's trust in the League of Nations' peace and justice. The suspension of the Shanghai conference is partly because China respects the League of Nations' resolution, as the Japanese proposal exceeded the limits notified by the League of Nations. Secondly, if it signed according to the Japanese proposal, it would be difficult to explain to the people of the country. Knowing that the delay would be useless to both sides, if the Japanese side could ensure that the League of Nations' face was not damaged and the Chinese government could explain it to the people of the country, China would be very happy for the Shanghai case to have a result as soon as possible. The British Ambassador agreed to mediate again and put forward three proposals, which the Chinese government can generally accept. The resumption of the peace talks is not far away. According to foreign sources, Guo Taiqi said that the mission of British Ambassador Lampson's visit was that since the Shanghai conference was suspended,</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity to come to Nanjing to meet with our government authorities to discuss Shanghai</p>
<p>The method of turning the group of events, and put forward mediation opinions, this morning, Lan</p>
<p>Has met with Wang Jiang, and our side is considering the opinions raised by Lan, and I will go to England, but there is no definite date, and I will return to Shanghai with Lan Shi on the same plane tomorrow. It must be determined after the meeting is held and the Committee's plan is passed before it can be held on a scheduled basis. Guo also talked about Japan's refusal of the draft resolution of the League of Nations, the key is that Article 11 stipulates that the mixed committee has the power to declare that the time for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops has arrived, and that the decision of the mixed committee can be effective with only a majority consent. The Japanese side believes that this provision is very embarrassing for it. In fact, Article 11 of the resolution determines the powers of the Mixed Committee. Most of the members of the Committee of Nineteen agreed to it. As for the Mixed Committee's decision, the decision depends on the majority, not necessarily unanimous. In the fourth annex of the draft armistice agreement in Shanghai, there are detailed rules for the Mixed Committee's office, which have been agreed by the Japanese representatives and become a passed resolution. The League of Nations Special Committee only reiterated it with a statement based on the Shanghai Conference agreement. Isn't it self-defeating for the Japanese to overturn the case now? Also, the Japanese side believes that the Mixed Committee has the power to declare the timing of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, regardless of whether it proves that its division is unknown, and what it has come for, and what it has gained. It seems that it cannot justify itself to its own people, so there are many difficulties. The League of Nations and</p>
<p>Friendly countries participating in the Shanghai Conference are now trying to mediate and dredge, and the mediation opinions put forward by the British Ambassador are also hoping that both parties can accept them, but our side must always take the premise of not infringing on the territorial sovereignty and not violating the League of Nations resolution as the principle. As for the rumors that the Japanese side intends to take the cessation of the anti-Japanese and resistance movement as a condition for the withdrawal of troops, we will never discuss this matter of a political nature, and the government will never be willing to allow the Japanese side to make this request before the Japanese troops are withdrawn. Even the convening of a round table conference has never been mentioned in the armistice conference (25th). Nanjing Special Dispatch, Guo Taiqi said to reporters that the time for the continuation of the armistice conference must be determined after the League of Nations public meeting passes the Committee's draft. However, the scope of the meeting is still limited to the war and the withdrawal of troops, and will never involve issues of a political nature. Guo originally planned to return to Shanghai on the 25th, but because of the failure, he will still return to Shanghai with the British Ambassador by plane on the morning of the 26th (25th).</p>
<p>Nanjing Special Dispatch, British Ambassador Lampson came to Nanjing on the 24th, but because it was a Sunday, he did not have a conversation with the authorities. At 10:00 a.m. on the 25th, Luo Wengan accompanied him to the Mausoleum to meet Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the trend of the armistice conference and appropriate solutions. At about 11 o'clock, he returned to the British Museum. At 1:00 p.m., he attended Wang Jingwei's banquet and also discussed the armistice conference. It is heard that the British Ambassador intends to seek an appropriate solution to the Shanghai affair within the scope of not violating the League of Nations resolution. He has contacted Jiang Wangluo in detail, and our authorities are still considering it seriously (25th).</p>
<p>Nanjing Special Dispatch Luo Wengan and Guo Taiqi, on the morning of the 25th, accompanied British Ambassador Lan to the Mausoleum to meet Wang Jiang and exchanged views on the issue of mediating the Shanghai affair. After talking for more than an hour, they resigned. At noon, Wang was in</p>
<p>Diplomatic House Zhao Lan, and also invited Luo, Guo, the British Counselor, the Secretary of the American Leader, and Xu Mo and Zheng Tianxi to accompany the seat. During the seat, there was another study on the Shanghai affair. After the meeting, Guo had originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 25th by Xianghe Wheel of Yihe Company. In view of the fact that the wheel had no cabins, it was temporarily changed to fly to Shanghai with the self-prepared plane of Jiang on the morning of the 26th. The staff and luggage of Guo, etc., were taken first by Xianghe Wheel on the afternoon of the 25th (2</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Receives Press</h3>
<p>Says Resistance to Japan is Key to Our Survival</p>
<p>Advocates Liaison with US and Russia in Diplomatic Policy</p>
<p>Allows People Freedom to Have Parties Outside the Party</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Zhesheng, a member of the Central Committee, recently drafted a draft outline for resisting Japan and saving the country at the present time. After it was disclosed in the newspapers, Mr. Sun again invited reporters from various newspapers to his residence on Moliel Road at 4:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>During the conversation, he re-explained the proposed outline for resisting Japan and saving the country in detail and sought the opinions of the reporters. The following is a summary of Mr. Sun's conversation:</p>
<p>Preparing for the Implementation of Constitutional Government Mr. Sun first said that the only way out for China today is to concentrate the strength of the whole country and resist Japan in a consistent and long-term manner. Japan is deliberately trying to apply the methods of the United Kingdom's subjugation of India to us in order to make our people vassals of Japan and implement its continental policy. If China does not effectively resist Japan, it will inevitably fall into the position of a second India and submit to Japan. However, resistance to Japan cannot be achieved by the government's individual strength today. Even if it concentrates the talents of the whole country and reorganizes the government, it cannot bear this huge responsibility. If we want to carry out the resistance to Japan, we can only achieve the final result through the cooperation of the government and the people of the whole country. It is undeniable that the central government cannot lead the people of the whole country, and the people cannot participate in politics and cannot cooperate with the government. If political change is not possible, national unity and resistance to Japan are impossible. Therefore, I have drafted an outline for resisting Japan and saving the country. This outline was telegraphed to the central government a few days ago and requested to be adopted. No reply has been received yet. The main point of this outline is to prepare for the implementation of constitutional government. The ultimate goal of the Kuomintang's political program is also constitutional government, but it must go through six years of political tutelage. Now there are four years of political tutelage, but it is only in name and has no effect. If we continue to do so, time will not wait for us. How can we deal with emergencies? Therefore, I advocate speeding up the preparation for the start of constitutional government without having to wait for the end of the form of political tutelage. And the unfinished work of local autonomy can be carried out at the same time after the start of constitutional government, without having to wait until it is completed. Once constitutional government is established, the government and the people will be united, and the strength of resistance to Japan will inevitably be strong.</p>
<p>Reforming Party Affairs Mr. Sun also said that</p>
<p>In terms of party affairs, the party's credibility has been completely lost recently. Now, if we want to remedy it, we must have the determination to thoroughly reform it. The methods are nothing more than two points: (1) Do not let the state support the party, but let the party members support the party. The past problems of party affairs were that party fees were paid by the government, and party members became a special class in society, similar to the Eight Banner children of the Qing Dynasty. The party and the people became like water and fire, and the party in various places, like the Supreme Government, arbitrarily interfered with administration and justice, and local officials also competed to manage the power of party affairs and fight for party committees, because if they did not do so, Jiang would not be able to maintain his position. This is the evil result of state support for the party. (2) After improving the party affairs facilities, the party headquarters should be secretive and there is no need to make it public. Party members should also be fully trained.</p>
<p>Explaining That There Are No Factions Within the Party Recently, Mr. Hu Hanmin explained the two phrases "no party outside the party, no factions within the party" in Hong Kong. However, I believe that these two phrases are actually contrary to what is thought. If we want to have no factions within the party, we must first have parties outside the party. Parties other than the Kuomintang should be allowed to exist within the scope of the law and compete with each other, then the Kuomintang will be able to unite and realize that there are no factions within the party. This point is very obvious. Everyone knows that the extreme left is the Communist Party, and the extreme right is the Nationalist Party, and the Kuomintang is in between the two. However, the political propositions of the left and right are all partially the same as the Three Principles of the People. As long as they operate within the scope of the law, they should be allowed to exist and should not be regarded as reactionary across the board.</p>
<p>The Basic Diplomatic Policy Mr. Sun said that the basic diplomatic policy should be based on the established policy of uniting with the nations in the world that treat us equally and fighting together. This is an immutable theory, because the mutual dealings between international countries are mostly based on the relationship of interests for advancement and retreat. All those with the same interests will have a close relationship because they stand on the same position of interests. At present, the United States and the Soviet Union are the ones that have the above-mentioned relationship of interests with our country. The United States and Russia seem unable to cooperate on the surface because of their different political systems, but this is not the case. The United States has long had economic relations with Soviet Russia. From economic relations, political relations will inevitably occur. Recently, the proposals of the Chairman of the US Foreign Affairs Committee, Bora, to restore US-Russian relations, etc., are all attractions of the relationship of interests between the two countries. China is the main player against Japan. All serious problems in the Far East arise from China and Japan. After Japan now occupies Northeast China, it wants to plot to use White Russia at the eastern end of Siberia to establish a buffer state similar to the three northeastern provinces as a barrier for Japan. At this time, China should observe the recent international situation and implement</p>
<p>Connect with the United States and Soviet Russia, etc. In addition, countries such as the United Kingdom and France also have considerable relations with our country, and should also be contacted accordingly.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Agreed in Principle The reporter again asked Mr. Sun whether the central government and Hu Hanmin had expressed any views on this proposal. Mr. Sun said that because the proposal had just been sent to Nanjing a few days ago, there was no telegram expression. However, Mr. Hu had telegraphed to express his agreement in principle, but he had some questions about the time sequence of the promulgation of the constitution and the work of local autonomy, and the two points of election and authority. I asked me, and I replied that the promulgation of the constitution and the time of local autonomy did not have to be listed in sequence and may be held at the same time. The authority of the election, the local elections are held in the villages and townships, and the professional elections are held in the cities. Those who have been elected in professional groups cannot be elected in the villages and townships, so that everyone can vote once, without duplication.</p>
<p>Go to Beijing for Joint Consultation At that time, the reporter asked Sun, if the central government</p>
<p>Adopt Mr. 's opinions on the draft outline for resisting Japan and saving the country. Will Mr. go to Beijing? Mr. Sun replied that if there is a meeting, he would be very willing to go to Beijing to consult with his comrades in the central government on everything.</p>
<p>Continue Armed Resistance The reporter also asked that the government and the people have already made up their minds not to give in to the Japanese diplomacy, but the Japanese side is so tough, then the negotiations will absolutely not end. May I ask what method our country will use to deal with it? Will it still maintain the attitude of neither peace nor war and delay the time? What does Mr. mean? Mr. Sun said that although the government has repeatedly declared that it will not sign a treaty that humiliates the country, if it does not have peace or war, and deceives and neglects its responsibilities, then even if it does not sign a treaty, the land of Shanghai will be handed over. Therefore, I advocate that if negotiations fall into an impasse, we should not hesitate to make any sacrifices and continue to resist with force. If we persevere, we will definitely win the final victory, etc.</p>
<h3>External Consultant Louis's Remarks</h3>
<p>Attitude of the League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<p>Mr. Louis, an American, advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and formerly appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Fengtian as an advisor to the Chinese delegation of the League of Nations Investigation Team, recently after the investigation team left customs to go to the Northeast for on-the-spot investigation, Mr. Louis returned to Shanghai due to some business. Yesterday morning at 11:00, Mr. Louis went to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Secretary Deng Zhongying. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency was also present, and through Mr. Deng's introduction, the following conversation with the reporter took place: (Reporter asked) When did you return to Shanghai, sir? (Dr. Louis replied) I returned to Shanghai yesterday by ship from Peiping. (Asked) Do you have any special missions for returning to Shanghai? (Answered) I don't have any special missions. I only hope to assist China. (Asked) What are your impressions of the League of Nations Investigation Team? (Answered) In Peiping, I personally witnessed the very fair attitude of the investigation team. They were very satisfied with the welcoming slogans posted by the Chinese people, which were just and fair. In terms of discussions, they paid close attention not only to government officials but also to ordinary people. In Peiping, except for attending a grand banquet and a tea party once each, all other invitations were declined. The petitions submitted by various circles were translated into English and French for the members of the team to read, and records were made of the talks with various parties. Each national representative in the team had political and legal advisors. All points of study were based on historical treaties and were discussed for a long time. (Asked) What is the legal relationship when the puppet state of Manchukuo refuses to allow Gu Weijun to cross the border? (Answered) The puppet state's refusal of Representative Gu is legally indefensible. The puppet state of Manchukuo is not recognized by any country. What is most incomprehensible is that when the Japanese representative, Dahua, was here, he was treated with great hospitality by all parties in China, while the puppet state's refusal of Gu is extremely surprising. (Asked) Will the League of Nations Investigation Team have any relationship with the puppet state? (Answered) When the investigation team left customs, they did not notify the puppet state. (Asked) How long will the League of Nations Investigation Team stay in the Northeast, and when will its mission be completed? (Answered) Since the Japanese army invaded the three eastern provinces, transportation in various places has been destroyed, which has caused inconvenience to the team's travel. The team has not yet decided how many days to stay. The report must be completed before approximately September 1st. Before that, they will find a quiet place to draft the report. It is said that they are quite interested in Qingdao. (Asked) The League of Nations Investigation Team has lost its freedom in the Northeast. Did the team plan any countermeasures when they were in Peiping? (Answered) When the team was in Peiping, the Japanese representative repeatedly stated that they would provide the team with all kinds of conveniences and help them complete their mission. The Chinese side also hopes so. I think the team will be able to move freely in Shenyang. Dr. Louis also said that in Peiping, he heard that there were more than 400 robbery cases inside and outside Shenyang city in March of this year, while in the same month of the previous year, there were only more than 40 cases. Dr. Louis also said that some people talked about the luxury car used by the League of Nations Investigation Team costing too much, but I know it did not cost a huge amount of money. In fact, this car was an old one. Dr. Louis is currently 62 years old. He came to China 34 years ago, then returned to the United States. In 1929, he came to China again and went to Shanxi, Henan, Jiangxi, and the three eastern provinces to investigate politics. Later, he went to Egypt and various parts of Russia to study politics and law. Then, at the invitation of Wu Kaisheng, who was attending the League of Nations General Assembly, he went to Geneva to assist Wu. Later, he received a telegram from the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, returning to China to serve as a consultant. At that time, the Japanese army was attacking Shenyang, and he was ordered to go to investigate, reporting the findings to the Ministry and telegraphed to the League of Nations General Assembly. Dr. Louis went to Jinzhou to investigate. At that time, Japanese planes were bombing Jinzhou, and Dr. Louis was also in the car. He then returned to Beijing, and when the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred, he also participated in the matters concerning the Shanghai Incident with Mayor Wu Tiecheng. Recently, when the League of Nations Investigation Team came to China, he served as an advisor to the Chinese delegation.</p>

<p>A special dispatch from Suzhou on the 25th states that at 10:00 AM on the 25th, 49 enemy soldiers from Yantang opened fire outside the post. 21 enemy soldiers from Xintang City went to the vicinity of Hongmiao on the main road to take photos, draw maps, and measure the terrain. There are currently more than 300 enemy soldiers in Xintang and more than 500 in Liuhe. The enemy in Hebei is digging trenches. There are more than 100 war horses at the automobile station, and there are more than 20 bicycles at Beishi Shao. The Liuhe Local Maintenance Association has been dissolved by the enemy. Three merchant ships arrived at Ludu Bridge, loaded with enemy weapons. The situation there is suddenly tense. Since the 21st, more than 80 enemy soldiers in Qianjing have been digging trenches. An Zheyuan, the commander of the enemy forces, arrived in Xintang City a few days ago. The headquarters is located on the main street, and trenches have also been dug for active defense. More than 40 Japanese soldiers arrived at Dong Yangjiaqiao in Taicang, all holding long bamboo poles, the purpose of which is unknown.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Disrupts Our Currency System</h3>
<p>Taking Civilian Goods as War Spoils</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Suzhou on the 25th states that after the enemy occupied Jiading, Baoshan, and other places, they issued 70 million yuan in Japanese paper currency. There are three types of one yuan, all of which are Japanese bank exchange coupons. There are also more than 100 boxes of silver auxiliary coins, divided into four types: fifty cents, twenty cents, ten cents, and five cents. One Chinese silver dollar is worth sixty Japanese cents. The enemy took items from the homes of Wu Zhongyi and others in Liuhe, loaded them onto ships, and transported them back to Japan as war spoils.</p>
<h3>Japanese Force Chinese Ships in the Northeast to Fly Puppet Flag</h3>
<p>Since Dandong, Yingkou, and other ports have fallen into Japanese hands, Chinese merchant ships in the Northeast that travel between Shanghai and various ports in the North and South Seas, such as Zhaoxing, Zhengji, Zhidong, and Yuda companies, have suspended services during the Shanghai war. Recently, as the ports have thawed, business has resumed, carrying goods to and from Shanghai, Shantou, Xiamen, and other places. However, recently, the Japanese in the Northeast have forced Chinese merchant ships in Dandong, Yingkou, Dalian, and other areas within the Japanese sphere of influence to fly the five-colored national flag of the puppet state. Those who resist will not be allowed to enter the port and sail. In Dalian, the police even notified various Chinese shipping companies to report and register their assets with the Japanese. Under this pressure, the Chinese merchants had to prepare a puppet state flag on their ships and take it out and hang it when arriving at Dandong, Niuzhuang, and other ports.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Martyrs Who Died Fighting Against Japan</h3>

The original letter is recorded below: Respected Sir/Madam, Since the [January 28th] Japanese invasion of Shanghai, our loyal 19th Route Army and 5th Army soldiers have united to resist the insult for the sake of national survival, fighting bloody battles for more than 30 days, finally stopping the stubborn and fierce Japanese and preventing them from succeeding. Their difficult and outstanding achievements have shocked the world. However, since the beginning of the war, the number of loyal soldiers who have sacrificed for justice on our entire front line is particularly large. The lofty aspirations and spirit of the martyrs who died for righteousness should be remembered forever. Moreover, the compatriots in the Songhu war zone who were victims of the war and innocently murdered by the Japanese invaders are countless. In the midst of our grief, our association initiated the anti-Japanese martyrs' memorial service for various organizations and the compatriots who were victims. A special office has been set up at No. 21 Hongxiang Lane, Xinzha Road. We hereby send a letter to your association, seeking participation, and hope that you will send representatives to jointly initiate the event. Please reply within five days of receiving the letter so that we can notify you to attend at any time. Please check and acknowledge.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Northeast Volunteer Army Arrive in Shanghai for Negotiations</h3>
<p>It is said that considerable results have been achieved.</p>
<p>Song Yihen, the head of the Shanghai Youth Volunteer Aid Corps, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met him yesterday at the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association and asked about the situation of the Northeast Volunteer Army. According to him, the total number of volunteer soldiers is over 400,000, but they lack rear support and unified command, which makes it difficult to attack the Japanese army. The Volunteer Army sent him to Shanghai a few days ago to negotiate aid matters with various parties. He has been in contact with celebrities in Shanghai for several days, and considerable results have been achieved. He is scheduled to go north tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Japanese Plane Bombing in Songjiang Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Shanghai reported that a Japanese plane dropped a bomb in the countryside near the 30th Bridge in Shihudang, Songjiang, destroying a house but not injuring anyone. After this consulate telegraphed to a certain agency in Songjiang to inquire, it replied that there was no such thing, which was also a rumor.</p>
<h3>International Radio Station Continues to Broadcast</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, the Zhenru International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications has been working as usual to maintain international communication services. On March 2, when our front-line troops changed their strategy and defended the second line of defense, the staff of the station had no choice but to withdraw with the army. Subsequently, European and American countries notified various countries and requested that it work as usual. At the same time, the diplomatic authorities of the United States, Germany, and France stationed in Shanghai, as well as the representatives of the League of Nations in Geneva, negotiated with the Japanese side to prevent the army from occupying the station, so as not to disrupt international communications. Therefore, the internal affairs of the station are still guarded and managed by personnel sent by the Ministry of Communications. It is now reported that the Ministry of Communications is considering waiting for the ceasefire negotiations to have a positive outcome, and the station will immediately resume operations. Before the station resumes operations, all international communication services of our country will be handled by the Fenglinqiao International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, which has added equipment and broadcasts as usual, which is also very smooth and fast.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship 'Trento' Departs Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, various countries competed to send warships to Shanghai to protect their citizens. Italy also specially sent the cruiser flagship 'Trento', carrying 500 marines to Shanghai, anchoring in the Huangpu River for more than a month. Now, as Shanghai has returned to normal, the Italian government has telegraphed the ship to return to its home country. Yesterday afternoon, the ship withdrew from Shanghai in compliance with the order.</p>
<h3>Female Traitor Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison for Seducing Women</h3>
<p>Ni Ada, Ma Chaonian, Accomplices</p>
<p>A traitorous Ningbo woman, Xia Ma, colluded with local Ni Ada and Ningbo man Ma Chaonian between the 18th and 21st of this month, claiming that a Westerner's newly opened bar in Yangshupu wanted to hire many Chinese women as waitresses, and deceived six women, Zhang Chen, Zhuo Lin, Huang Zhang, Liu Huang, Liu Gu, and Chen Lu, to a place called Yunbinmo, No. 132 Bazilu, run by the Japanese, and then sent them to the Nanyang Hotel in Jiading, where they were used by the Japanese army for obscene purposes, from which they profited. The case was investigated and arrested by Chinese detective Liu Decheng and Western detective Xiaoerfu of the Hongkou Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, requested a strict trial. All the details of the interrogation and confessions have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the first trial and sentenced Xia Ma, Ni Ada, and Ma Chaonian to ten years of imprisonment for jointly intending to profit by abducting women under the age of twenty. The number of days of detention before the determination of the judgment will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days. The family of Ma Chaonian hired lawyer Fan Gang to request that Ma remain detained at the police station during the appeal period, which the court approved.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Post Office Resumes Operation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration announced that the Zhenru Station Third Class Post Office was temporarily closed due to the war. Now that the situation in the area has eased, the post office has resumed operation since the 18th of this month. However, parcel and remittance services are still temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Book Industry to Yu Youren</h3>
<p>Regarding the Opposition to the Increase in Postal Rates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Book Industry Association sent a letter to President Yu Youren, stating: Respected President Youren, With all due respect, this postal rate increase is extremely onerous for book postage. Only provinces adjacent to this province and those connected by railway and track remain the same. Provinces separated by land and not connected by railway and track must be doubled. Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, if connected by railway and track, are doubled, and if not connected by railway and track, are tripled (Yunnan is tripled regardless of whether there is railway and track). For example, only Tongguan in your province is connected by train, which requires double the fee. Huaxian, Lintong, Chang'an, Fengxiang, and other counties, as well as all parts of the province, require triple the fee. However, parcels from Shanghai and Wuhan to Japan, regardless of whether they are Hokkaido or Ryukyu, and whether they are connected by railway and track, are charged a simple fee. This not only excludes the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou from the Republic of China but also excludes the five provinces from Japan. What is the intention? What kind of government is this? It is truly incomprehensible. Vice Minister of Communications Chen Ci stated that book postage loses more than 2 million yuan per year. We do not know on what basis this is claimed. According to the association's investigation, book postage to the five western provinces is the highest in Sichuan, no more than 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per year. Shaanxi and Yunnan are no more than 10,000 yuan, and Gansu and Guizhou are no more than several thousand yuan, totaling less than 100,000 yuan. The immaturity of their culture and education can be seen. Even if the post office triples the fee, it will not increase by more than 200,000 yuan per year. Even if the provinces that are not connected by railway and track are doubled, the total is probably less than 500,000 yuan. Obstructing the education and culture of the five western provinces and areas not connected by railway and track with a mere 500,000 yuan, collecting reading donations from the five western provinces and areas not connected by railway and track, and giving the intellectual class an injustice is very undesirable for the government. Vice Minister Chen also stated that newspaper postage loses hundreds of thousands of yuan per year, but because newspapers are related to culture, the price is not increased. However, according to the association's statistics on paper consumption, newspapers actually use more paper than books. Vice Minister Chen stated that newspapers are related to culture, but he is not aware that elementary school and popular books are more related to culture than newspapers. Moreover, newspaper readers are mostly middle-class or above, while elementary school and popular books are necessary for ordinary people. It is even more essential that the postage not be increased compared to newspapers. Some say that the postage must be increased to compensate for the losses of aviation. We believe that aviation is important and should be carried out even if there are slight losses. However, if it obstructs the education and culture of the five western provinces and areas not connected by railway and track, it would be better not to operate aviation. The importance of aviation is not as important as education and culture. Others say that it is due to the losses of the postal remittance and savings bureau, which is even more incomprehensible. Postal remittances and savings are banking in nature. The interest rate is small, and there are various conveniences. If this loses money, then all banks in China and abroad would have closed their doors long ago. If there is a real loss, why not stop it? On the one hand, there are savings banks that can replace it, and the government does not need to plan savings for the people. On the other hand, it is even more upside down to obstruct education and culture due to postal remittances and savings. The association has long admired your Excellency's outstanding knowledge and emphasis on education and culture. You are also from Shaanxi and have traveled to Sichuan and Gansu, so you must know the immaturity of education and culture in the west and the urgency of the need for books. Therefore, we dare not avoid verbose words and present the above. We hope that you will review it, submit it to the National Government meeting, and order the Ministry of Communications to withdraw its order to benefit culture and maintain the foundation of the country. We are eagerly looking forward to it. Moreover, the buyer is responsible for the postage of purchased goods, which is a common practice in all industries in China and abroad, and the book industry is no exception. For mail-order customers, the buyer directly pays the postage and remittance fee. For those sold by local distributors, postage and remittance fees are also added. Because the association is close to book buyers, we are pleading for book buyers, not for the benefit of the industry. We are afraid of misunderstandings and hereby clarify. We respectfully wish you well.</p>
<h3>Declaration of Shanghai Businessmen and Residents Requesting Exemption from Rent</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Rent Reduction Discussion Committee organized by the Municipal Federation's Hongkou District Branches and the Shanghai Business Community Joint Association of Suzhou Road, North Jiangxi Road, North Xizang Road, Gansu Road, Auerjin Road, Haining Road, Broadway Road, Wuzhou Road, Huade Road, West Huade Road, Hanbile Road, and other organizations has been working hard to implement rent reduction and exemption measures, and has printed and distributed slogans for three months of rent exemption to member stores and residents, posted at the entrance, unanimously expressing their position. Now, members of Auerjin Road, Ningkang Lane, North Shanxi Road, Taian Lane, and others have requested negotiations for rent exemption. After discussion by the association yesterday, it was decided to exempt rent for three months north of Suzhou Creek, to negotiate separately, and to issue a declaration, stating that Japanese tyranny and cruelty have bombarded Shanghai, destroying its essence. The Hongkou area has borne the brunt of the impact, and the damage since the war is pitiful. Even today, the Japanese army still occupies the roads, creating an atmosphere of terror. It is no wonder that ordinary residents are afraid to move back in this state. The so-called internal security and resistance to foreign aggression should be considered comprehensively. If it is not a safe time, these actions are not the time and should be postponed to avoid disputes. The real estate business is related to the market and must be maintained. Since the Northeast Incident, coupled with the decline of Shanghai's commerce, the economic panic has reached its extreme. The only way to adjust the situation is to reduce and exempt rent and various donations as a way to rescue the market. We know that land prices are high now, unlike in the past, and the impact on life is huge. It is important to know that the owners still have profits, which is considerable. We hope that you will understand the business situation after this disaster, the pain of which is unspeakable, and provide relief to show conscience. After rent exemption, automatically reduce the rent to reduce the burden and wait for the future. The association and other places are located in Hongkou, and the pain is difficult to bear. We focus on facts regarding rent reduction and exemption, and the law should be tolerant. We hope you will understand this and relieve the people's difficulties. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>Shipping Overseas Impoverished Compatriots Returning Home</h3>
<p>Agreed with Dala Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, previously instructed by the Ministry of Communications to consult with the Shipping Industry Association and Dala Company, will carry impoverished compatriots returning home on the company's ships leaving Japan. An agreement has now been reached, and the prices have also been set. Those boarding in Yokohama will pay 27 Japanese yen, and those boarding in Kobe will pay 23 yen. The ship will transport people once a week, 100 people each time. Currently, there are 2,000 compatriots in Japan who need the government to purchase tickets and board the company's ships to return home, which will take five months to complete. The bureau has now reported the above-mentioned consultation to the Ministry of Communications and transferred it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ordering the consuls in Yokohama and Kobe to inform the compatriots and concentrate them in one place (Yokohama or Kobe). Once the consulate reports the confirmed location of the concentration, it will be notified to Dala Company for implementation, so that the company's ships will reserve 100 passengers each time they pass through Yokohama or Kobe, so that the impoverished compatriots can return to their motherland.</p>

<h3>Discovery of Shen Zhuowu's Remains</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Zhuowu, the manager of the "China Evening News," has been missing since the "Daji" ship disaster last winter, with no news of his life or death. Although Shen's family and the Tongru Chonghaitai Shanghai Association offered a large reward to find Shen's whereabouts, there has been no trace of him to this day. Unexpectedly, near dusk the night before, a corpse suddenly floated to the surface of the river near Gaoqiao in Pudong. It was retrieved by people. The face was already decomposed and unrecognizable, but all the clothing and personal belongings were confirmed to be Mr. Shen's belongings during his lifetime. There was also a free ticket for the Jinghu Railway, which was still faintly discernible, with Shen's surname noted on it. This further proves that it was undoubtedly Mr. Shen's remains. After hearing the news, the family was filled with mixed emotions of grief and joy and rushed to the site where the body was found yesterday. After further detailed identification, they will arrange for coffining and burial as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Customs to Restrict Rice Exports</h3>
<p>Tang Haian, the Jianghai Customs Superintendent, stated that since March of this year, rice merchants from various counties in the Jiangsu Province have been coming to Shanghai to purchase rice. As rice from this province has always been allowed to circulate, the customs have been instructed to verify and release it based on the documents and passports provided by the respective county governments or</p>
<p>chambers of commerce. A total of over 10,000 shi has been handled. However, in recent months, rice buyers from various places have been flocking here, with daily shipments of rice reaching about 2,000 to 3,000 shi. Furthermore, places like Haimen and Nantong have each shipped over several thousand shi, which seems to exceed their needs. If this continues without restriction, it would be contrary to the intention of carefully managing the people's food supply. Currently, the price of rice in the Shanghai market has reached about fifteen yuan per shi. At a time when the military situation has not yet ended, the people's food supply in the rear must be considered and cared for.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Nantong, Chongming, Haimen, and other places are located along the coast, making it extremely easy to export, and abuses must be prevented. It seems appropriate to set restrictions based on the current relief needs of each county to ensure prevention is still in mind during circulation. A report has already been submitted to the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for their information and implementation.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Replies to Chamber of Commerce: New Sugar Tax Cannot Be Postponed</h3>
<p>The Municipal Sugar Industry Association, considering that sugar merchants could not bear the burden after the implementation of the new sugar tax, had accompanied Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to Beijing to petition. However, the Finance Minister Song had left Beijing, resulting in no outcome. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, approving that no postponement would be granted. The original telegram stated, "To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Upon review, the newly established sugar tax rates were implemented on the first of this month. The request for special modifications and postponed implementation should not be considered. Please inform the Sugar Industry Association accordingly." Issued by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Reopening of RiHua Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>No Japanese Soldiers Inside</p>
<p>The RiHua Cotton Mill in Lujiazui, Pudong, owned by Japanese merchants, has been closed for three months due to the Shanghai War. The mill's authorities are now eager to resume operations. They attempted to reopen last Monday, but few workers showed up, preventing the reopening from happening. To understand the workers' attitude, the mill invited Zhang, the district chief of the third district of the local Public Security Bureau, to discuss the reopening</p>
<p>measures. Chief Zhang replied that if the mill were sincerely opening, he would persuade the workers to come to the mill. The Japanese heard this and considered it satisfactory. They changed the official reopening to this Monday and instructed the foremen to inform the workers to come to the mill. Yesterday morning, when the reopening date arrived, the mill still adopted a trial nature and did not sound the whistle. The workers, unaware of the mill's attitude, had a portion of the workers, about eight or nine hundred, enter the mill to inspect. They saw that there were indeed no traces of Japanese soldiers inside, and the machinery had been repaired. The mill seemed to be sincere. However, the workers only stayed for a short while, and most of them left the mill. Only a part of the old workers stayed, as their work required them to start earlier. It is expected that a majority of the workers will officially return to work today.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Improvement Society Plans to Establish a "January 28th" Refugee Factory</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Improvement Society was initiated by dozens of enthusiastic social service individuals in Shanghai, including Zhu Maocheng, Li Denghui, Jiang Wenyu, Pan Yangyao, Niu Huisheng, Ying Shugui, Li Zhaohuan, and Liang Tuchun, with the aim of assisting Chinese people in building a national economy and improving people's lives. Recently, in light of the "January 28th Incident," many people in the war zone have been displaced and unable to make a living.</p>
<p>There are many cases. They plan to establish a "January 28th" refugee factory to seek fundamental relief. It is heard that a concrete plan has been drafted. Based on the principles of easy learning, wide sales, low cost, abundant raw materials, and containing the meaning of occupational improvement, it is planned to establish six types of workshops: (1) Weaving Factory, (2) Woodworking Factory, (3) Glass Factory, (4) Leather Factory, (5) Straw Weaving Factory, (6) Sewing Factory. All internal expenses are kept to a minimum. It is estimated that sixty thousand yuan will be sufficient for the establishment costs and six months of operating expenses. It is heard that the Shanghai Christian War Zone Relief Society is willing to cooperate and plans to donate five thousand yuan to handle this matter. Other public organizations have expressed sympathy for this fundamental relief measure and will provide assistance.

It is said that all European countries, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south, are being recruited to join the alliance, because the current situation in the Far East makes this alliance easier to establish.</p>

<h3>National Socialist Party Wins Victory in German State Parliament Elections</h3>
<p>Prussia Suddenly Increases to 162 Seats</p>
<p>Hitler Can Take Control of the Overall Situation</p>
<p>Creating a Precedent for the National Socialist Takeover of Germany</p>
<p>Guomin News, Berlin, 25th: As a result of the Prussian parliamentary elections, the National Socialist Party won a great victory everywhere, jumping from six seats to 162 seats in the parliament, almost doubling the number of votes obtained in the German general election in September 1930. However, compared with the results of the second round of voting in the recent presidential re-election, its number of votes did not increase everywhere. In addition, the Catholic Center Party's resistance was not weak. Although the original 71 seats have now been reduced to 67 seats, the number of votes has increased by 6% compared with the 1930 general election. The Communist Party has also been able to maintain its position, increasing from 54 seats to 57 seats, but losing 3% of the votes compared with the 1930 general election. In addition, most parties have lost seats, with the People's Party losing the most, from 40 seats to 6 seats, and the Democratic Party falling from 21 seats to 3 seats.</p>
<p>Guomin News, Berlin, 25th: According to the government's announcement, the results of yesterday's Prussian elections show the following divisions in the new parliament: (1) The right-wing parties, including the National Socialist Party, the National People's Party, the People's Party, the Christian Socialist Party, and the Hanoverian Party, can occupy a total of 202 seats. (2) The Weimar coalition, that is, the Catholic Center Party, the Socialist Party, and the Democratic Party, which manipulated the old parliament and organized the current government, can occupy a total of 162 seats. (3) The Communist Party, the left-wing opposition party, has 57 seats. From this point of view, even if the National Socialist Party unites with the right-wing parties, it is still nine seats short of a majority in the parliament. Conversely, if the Weimar coalition still tries to maintain a minority cabinet, it will be difficult for the Communist Party to vote against the government, and the National Socialist Party can control the government's fate. Therefore, today's Prussian election can be said to have created an unsolvable deadlock.</p>
<p>Guomin News, Berlin, 25th: After the results of the Prussian elections were announced this morning, the parties immediately began to express their positions on negotiations for the formation of a new government. The National Socialist Party first issued a declaration stating that the new Prussian Prime Minister must be elected by Hitler. Hitler will welcome cooperation from all factions that are prepared to support the national policies produced by social justice and hard work. An hour later, the Catholic Center Party also issued a declaration stating that the party is willing to cooperate with those who are determined to serve the country, seek public welfare, and guarantee the maintenance of democracy and Christian culture based on the current constitution. However, the party will fully oppose any attempt to create a one-party dictatorship, hinder domestic laws and order, or change the foreign policy of the wise and virtuous. The party occupies a pivotal position in the new parliament. If Hitler cannot obtain its open or tacit support, it will be difficult to expect the position of Prime Minister. The Communist Party also issued a declaration stating that yesterday's victory of the National Socialist Party was the natural result of the Socialist Party's ambivalent policies. The Communist Party will concentrate its efforts in the future to absorb Socialist Party workers so as to engage in a desperate battle against the National Socialists.</p>
<p>Guomin News, Stuttgart, 25th: In the election of the Hutenburg State Parliament in Germany, the National Socialist Party also won a great victory. According to the preliminary total results obtained this morning, the National Socialist Party can obtain about 20 seats, the Catholic Center Party 20 seats, the Socialist Party 12 seats, the Farmers' Party 8 seats, the Communist Party 7 seats, the Christian Socialist Party 3 seats, the German National Party 3 seats, and two other small parties each one seat. Although the National Socialist Party has more than doubled its seats, it cannot occupy a majority even if it unites with other right-wing parties. Therefore, it is expected that the coalition cabinet of the Republic will still be able to continue.</p>
<p>Guomin News, Hamburg, 25th: In yesterday's Hamburg parliamentary elections, the National Socialist Party also jumped to become the strongest party. Although the Socialist Party won many seats from the Communist Party, its number of seats is still less than that of the National Socialist Party. In the future, the new Hamburg parliament will have 51 seats for the National Socialist Party, 49 seats for the Socialist Party, 26 seats for the Communist Party, 18 seats for the Democratic Party, 7 seats for the National People's Party, 5 seats for the People's Party, 2 seats for the Catholic Center Party, 1 seat for the Economic Party, and 1 seat for the Christian Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Guomin News, Berlin, 25th: Yesterday's Prussian parliamentary election was one of the most important periods in modern German history. Can Hitler, the leader of the National Socialist Party, indirectly open the door of the Prussian government after the presidential election to cultivate the Third Reich with National Socialist principles? This will be answered by this action. Therefore, Germany and the entire Europe are anxiously awaiting the result of the Prussian parliamentary election to answer this question. However, the enemies of Hitler also acknowledge the party divisions revealed recently that Hitler can take control of the overall situation in the new government. The alliance cabinet formed by Hitler and Hugenberg is also something that everyone expects. Prussia alone occupies 26 of the 64 seats in the Federal Council, and there are 80,000 police officers available for use. Therefore, once Hitler takes power, he will be able to control the federal government and create a precedent for the National Socialist takeover of Germany.</p>
<p>Guomin News, Berlin, 25th: Today's political and journalistic comments on yesterday's parliamentary elections vary in opinion, but they have one thing in common: April 24th can be called an important date in Germany's painful post-war history, marking the beginning of a new period. However, the nature of this new period varies from person to person. The conservative newspaper Morning Post stated that even if the parliament is deadlocked, it will still indicate three things: (1) The National Socialist Party cannot be prevented from fulfilling its mission by improper means. (2) The Socialist Party will decline after losing its last base in the Prussian government. (3) The small parties have lost their importance after being hit by economic decline and will be in an insignificant position in the future. Finally, it also stated that this shows that the German people are ready to cooperate with the National Socialist Party to form a new Prussian government. The Berlin Daily of the Democratic Party stated that no matter what changes happen in the future, it is clear that the majority of voters are dissatisfied with the current system. But one thing cannot be ignored, that is, two-thirds of the voters oppose capitalism, because the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the National Socialist Party all oppose the current capital system, which has caused economic chaos. It also said that the result of this election was caused by the heavy burden of reparations imposed on Germany by various countries and the failure to solve the international crisis. Otherwise, the situation would not be like this. Therefore, based on the law of cause and effect, it can be said that this election is the final warning to the world, or it can be called the final appeal to common sense. If future international negotiations can listen to this statement, the bad results may be avoided. Otherwise, if it is still ignored, those who ignore this matter should no longer blame Germany or the National Socialist Party for its faults.</p>

<h3>Poland Reduces Military Spending</h3>
<p>Will Reopen Non-Aggression Treaty Negotiations With Russia</p>
<p>Guomin News, Warsaw, 24th: Poland will greatly reduce military spending again. After General Pilsudski returned to the country, Finance Minister Witoszewski went to consult on reducing military spending to ease the national treasury. Pilsudski initially strongly opposed it, but after Witoszewski repeatedly stated the reasons, he agreed to the reduction. It is expected that the Polish military budget will be reduced from 2.5 billion Polish zlotys to 2 billion. Poland's military spending has already been reduced by 500 million this year, and this is the second time. It is expected that Poland urgently wants to reopen non-aggression treaty negotiations with Soviet Russia, probably to reduce military spending.</p>
<h3>As Labor Day Approaches, the Japanese Left-Wing Activates</h3>

Yesterday, the 24th, in the Fukagawa area, more than ten people including Akiba Shingo, the person in charge of the Koto jurisdiction of Zenkyo, were holding a secret meeting when four detectives from the police station broke in and arrested three people, including Arika Katsu, a representative of Zenkyo Nagano and a student who dropped out of the Faculty of Arts of Teikyo University. However, Akiba knew that the authorities would exert pressure and had prepared in advance, using a pistol to threaten the detectives and taking the opportunity to jump from the second floor to the roof of the neighboring house and escape.</p>
<h3>Japan Eagerly Seeks to Sell Silk Stockpiles</h3>
<p>Reuters, Osaka, 25th: The Japanese government has decided to allow the Kobe Asahi Silk Company to sell its stockpile of 108,000 bales of raw silk, of which 81,000 bales are accumulated under the Price Subsidy Law, and the remaining 27,000 bales are jointly accumulated by the industry. The banking group will sign a contract with Asahi Silk Company, stipulating that the price per bale will be above 450 yuan. It is heard that the Asahi Company representative in the New York Jersey branch must pay a deposit of 150 yuan per bale in the first year. If the market price falls below 450 yuan, this money will be confiscated. It is expected that this stockpile of silk will be sold in various places, with about 40,000 bales shipped to the United States, 20,000 bales shipped to Europe, 30,000 bales sold in the country, and the remaining 20,000 bales shipped elsewhere for sale. The loss on this stockpile of silk totals 10.2 million yuan, of which 3.5 million yuan will be recognized by the industry, 1.5 million yuan will be recognized by the banks, and the remaining 5.3 million yuan will be borne by the Japanese government. The timing and method of silk sales by the Asahi branch are not yet known in detail.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Investigating Group Passes Through Qin Island</h3>
<p>Lytton and Chinese-Japanese members will take a ship to Dalian</p>
<p>American and Italian members leisurely tour the "First Pass Under Heaven"</p>
<p>Japanese troops temporarily raise a puppet state flag on a high tree in Yuguan</p>
<p>Qin Huangdao Correspondence: The League of Nations investigating group's special train, after departing from Tianjin East at approximately 2:00 AM on the 20th, had most of its members asleep. As the train passed through Tanggu, Tangshan, and other places, they were all dreaming and unaware. By the time they arrived at Guye, the sun was high in the sky. The members and attendants then had an early tea, gathering in the dining car. Lytton and the Chinese representative Gu Weijun sat at a small table, constantly asking for the names of the stations. At 9:40 AM, the special train arrived at Qinwangdao Station.</p>
<p>The station was decorated with pine branch arches, embedded with hundreds of electric lights. Students from the Rotary School, who were there to welcome them, played ancient music with elegant sounds and neat attire. He Zhuguo, the commander of the Ninth Brigade, and Director Fan of the Public Security Bureau had arrived on the island by train in advance. After the train stopped, Commander He boarded the train to meet Lytton, introduced by Mr. Ning Xiangnan. Lytton, seeing the vast ocean to the south from the train, inquired about the distance between the station and the seaside, as well as the daily tonnage of coal transported from the Kailuan Coal Mine. The special train</p>
<p>stopped at the station for about fifteen minutes and was then pulled by an electric locomotive from Kailuan towards the seaside</p>
<p>dock. The train moved very slowly because the roadbed was made of wood. After about twenty minutes, Representative Gu, accompanied by Tonner (an Englishman) and Chen Liting, disembarked to board the ship.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the dock, the Chinese warship "Haiqi" was berthed alongside. Two Japanese destroyers, the "Asagao" and the "Fuyou," were also present. As soon as the special train stopped, the Chinese warship first sounded its horn to pay respect. The members disembarked, and a gentle sea breeze blew, with waves crashing against the rocks, creating high splashes of water. From the "Haiqi"</p>
<p>warship, the view was boundless, refreshing the mind. After Lytton disembarked, he walked with Gu Weijun, holding walking sticks, to inspect the "Haiqi" warship. Guided by the captain, they finished the tour and went ashore. Chief Tan of the Beining Railway supervised the removal of luggage. Lytton had four iron boxes with him, mostly containing important investigation documents. The "Haiqi" warship had prepared seating for thirty-seven people in advance, which was temporarily insufficient. Twelve sets of bedding were borrowed from the Beining Railway. The interior of the warship was neatly arranged, with several rattan chairs placed at the bow for viewing. After about an hour, the luggage was unloaded. Lytton then boarded the ship with Gu again, standing at the bow with advisor Tonner. The Chinese representatives and attendants also boarded the ship one after another. The well-wishers gathered at the edge of the island. At 11:40 AM, the ship's whistle sounded and the anchor was raised. Lytton stood on the</p>
<p>ship, frequently nodding to the well-wishers to express his gratitude. At that time, Mr. Wu Xiufeng and Mr. Chen Liting, the Chinese secretaries, stood on the lookout platform. The well-wishers wished them safe travels, and</p>
<p>Chen responded with "Thank you for your blessings," creating a humorous scene that made people忍不住不住. After the "Haiqi" warship set sail, the ship moved steadily, with no wind or waves on the sea. In less than half an hour, the ship was out of sight, with only the radio mast and a wisp of black smoke visible. The ship was scheduled to arrive in Dalian in ten hours. The reporter met Representative Gu Weijun at the dock. Gu said that his trip to the Northeast via Dalian was entirely based on the investigating group's proposal, and he did not plan to stay in Dalian for long, heading straight to Shenyang. The future itinerary would naturally be decided by the investigating group. Regarding the puppet state's refusal to allow him to go and their various intimidation tactics, he had made a firm determination to go, regardless of any sacrifices, and for the sake of the country's future, he could not be afraid of difficulties and seek comfort. The reporter then asked Secretary Wu Xiufeng to inquire Lytton for his opinion. Lytton replied that the investigating group's itinerary to the Northeast was still difficult to determine at the moment, and the scope of the investigation was not limited to the South Manchurian Railway line. He was extremely grateful for the generous hospitality received during the investigating group's visit to Peiping and was very pleased. The duration of their stay in the Northeast was expected to be four weeks, and they would return to Peiping in the future. The summary report to be sent to Geneva would be sent to the League of Nations before May. The location for the future comprehensive report would still be decided in Beidaihe or Laoshan in Qingdao, China. Japanese Representative Yoshida and attendant Hayashi</p>
<p>Izuru, along with four Japanese journalists and Claude Hini, disembarked and entered the Japanese destroyer "Asagao." After the "Haiqi" warship set sail, the Japanese warship followed closely behind within ten minutes. The "Fuyou" destroyer departed eastward at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>American Representative McCoy and Italian Representative Makoedi wanted to investigate the situation outside Shanhaiguan and did not disembark. They had lunch on the island at 12:30 PM. At 1:00 PM, the special train returned to the station, scheduled to arrive at Shanhaiguan at 2:00 PM to tour the Great Wall and the "First Pass Under Heaven." At 1:30 PM, Commander He Zhuguo departed first on the fourth armored train. At 2:10 PM, the investigating group's special train departed eastward. At 3:00 PM, it arrived at Shanhaiguan, where over a thousand people from all walks of life welcomed them at the station. McCoy and Marcoedi disembarked, took a photo with the welcoming representatives, and then inquired Commander He Zhuguo about the situation outside the pass and whether there were a large number of bandits. While Marcoedi was talking to He, several Japanese soldiers patrolled with weapons. Marcoedi asked about the number of Japanese troops in Shanhaiguan and paid great attention to the Japanese soldiers patrolling the streets. They then walked from the station to the "First Pass Under Heaven" and toured for a long time before returning to the station. While Marcoedi and McCoy were touring, Japanese soldiers secretly sent plainclothes detectives to follow them, intending to monitor them. At about 5:00 PM, the special train returned to Qinhuangdao. The Shanhaiguan</p>
<p>station's most eye-catching event was after the investigating group's special train arrived at the station. Suddenly, a yellow flag was inserted into the railway on the east side of the east gate outside the station. The reporter personally went to see it and found that it was the flag of the puppet state of Manchuria, about two feet long, with red, blue, white, and black stripes, and yellow in the upper corner of the flag. According to local people, four Japanese soldiers had raised the flag there this morning, claiming that this place was the boundary between the two countries, which surprised everyone. Regarding the issue of the Italian and American representatives leaving the pass, the Japanese had sent Deputy Consul Fujita stationed in Tianjin to contact them at any time. The Italian and American representatives were</p>
<h3>The Only Female Secretary of the Chinese Delegation, Chen Yichun, Poses for a Photo on the "Haiqi" Warship</h3>
<p>originally scheduled to leave the pass on a special train borrowed from the Beining Railway. Kan Ze, the director of the puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau, suddenly telegraphed the Shanhaiguan station, saying that the Beining train was not allowed to leave the pass, and a special train had been dispatched from Jinzhou, which would arrive at 7:00 PM. A Japanese armored train arrived first on the 20th, carrying 120 Japanese soldiers led by Ko Sugata. The Japanese armored train stopped at the south end of the station, and the Japanese soldiers prohibited Chinese people from walking within fifty steps, directly regarding Shanhaiguan as their territory, bullying us excessively. After the Italian and American representatives returned to Qinhuangdao, they went to a banquet hosted by the Kailuan manager. In the evening, the area near Qinhuangdao Station was heavily guarded by the Ninth Brigade and the Beining Railway Police. The special train prepared by the puppet Fengshan Railway arrived at Shanhaiguan at 7:20 PM on the 20th, with the puppet Manchurian flag and the Japanese flag flying on the train. Lü Mengfu, the chief of the puppet Fengshan Railway Transportation Department, personally recruited disciples on the train. The American and Italian representatives and Secretary-General Haas had scheduled to leave for the Northeast early on the 21st, making short visits to Suizhong, Jinzhou, Dagushan, and other places. Japanese Consul Fujita accompanied them. After the American and Italian representatives met with Lytton in Shenyang, they would determine the specific investigation work plan.</p>
<p>The special train for the investigating group traveling east from Peiping was extremely well-prepared. The attendants in the train were all fluent in English and provided extremely valuable cigars and snacks to entertain the members and attendants. At the same time, the Railway Bureau issued round silver train badges, which were hung on the lapels, which were quite beautiful. Among the Chinese delegation, Chen Yichun was the only woman, and even on the train, she kept typing, with the tapping sounds of her typewriter and those of European and American journalists following one another endlessly. When the special train arrived at the Qinhuangdao dock, it was the time for the coal miners to rest for lunch.</p>
<p>Seeing the special train arrive, the workers all stared at the train. The foreign guests, seeing these figures all in black, with only white teeth showing, holding golden-yellow cornbread in their hands and chewing with open mouths, prompted one representative to ask Chen Liting, who told him the situation, noting that the enjoyment on this special train was truly like heaven compared to the hard-working workers. Italian Representative</p>
<p>Marcoedi, after arriving at Shanhaiguan from Qinhuangdao, first went to visit the "First Pass Under Heaven." The interpreter told him the name, and the Italian representative, with a strong curiosity, murmured on the way back, still reciting "The First Pass Under Heaven" repeatedly. In the evening, after returning to the island, the representatives and attendants had dinner in the dining car, toasted with champagne. After the meal, each person was given a bright yellow flower, which they either inserted diagonally into their clothes or placed under their ties. One attendant suddenly became inspired and sang loudly, and others joined in, turning the desolate shores of Qinhuangdao into a temporary dance hall. When the reporter boarded the train to return west, the singing was still ongoing. Compared to our compatriots crying out in the Northeast, it was truly like heaven and earth. Moved by this, I wrote this on the way (night of the 20th).</p>
<h3>Newspaper Criticizes Stimson's Words and Actions</h3>
<p>Mocking His Rashness and Perversity</p>
<p>Tokyo Jiji Shinpo comments on the words and actions of U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, saying that Stimson's every move at the International Disarmament Conference concerning the Far East issue affects international relations. In recent years, Stimson has inherited the ideals of former Secretaries of State Hughes and Kellogg in the cause of disarmament and the Non-Aggression Pact, and has always sought effective development. However, Stimson's past words and actions have often been contrary to the self-respecting attitude of previous Secretaries of State. As evidenced by the Sino-Soviet dispute in the past, Stimson originally intended to propose the Non-Aggression Pact, but the Soviet government strongly opposed it, and the Japanese government expressed that the Sino-Soviet dispute should be resolved by China and the Soviet Union themselves. Therefore, the Khabarovsk Agreement was soon reached to resolve the dispute. When the Sino-Japanese Incident broke out this time, the U.S. State Department initially adopted a quiet and self-respecting attitude, but when the Japanese army occupied Jinzhou, the situation suddenly changed, and even the content of the talks between Foreign Minister Shidehara and Ambassador Forbes was rashly disclosed to reporters, which surprised various countries both inside and outside. The slip of the tongue was truly unexpected. Such perverse and untrustworthy words and actions inevitably arouse careless criticism. Now that Ambassador Forbes to Japan has resigned and returned home, when the Philippine independence bill passed the House of Representatives, Stimson published an extravagant statement in his announcement that Japan harbored ambitions for the Philippines, which is even more incomprehensible to us. Most noteworthy is that the American people advocate an economic blockade against Japan, and Stimson himself not only strongly sympathizes with it, but also promotes it from within. Such inflammatory, rash, and careless words and actions disregard the national relations between Japan and the United States and only harm the feelings of the people between the two countries. Therefore, we hope that Stimson will not add to Japan with frivolous words and actions again.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Troops Deployed to Aid Fujian</h3>
<p>Various divisions and brigades in Chaozhou and Meizhou gather on the border awaiting orders</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After Longyan and Zhangzhou in southern Fujian fell one after another, we immediately received telegrams from the Southern Fujian Hometown Relief Association, appealing for troops to be sent to aid them. There were rumors that the Guangdong army had entered Fujian, but this morning (22nd), according to news from Dabu, the Guangdong army's Huang Yanzhen Division had indeed arrived in the Xiaojing, Gucun, Zuobi, and Shitou areas on the border between Dabu and Yongding. The First Teaching Regiment of Zhao Lan was transferred from Pingyuan to Dabu and is awaiting mobilization orders to immediately enter Shanghang and Yongding. The Red bandits in Yongding County are the Zhang Dingcheng Division, which is composed of local communists and has weak combat power, so there is not much to fear. The Independent First Brigade of the Fujian army, led by Zhong Shaokui, is still in the Yanqian, Zhongdu, and Fengshi areas on the border between Wuping and Shanghang. The Yan Yingyu and Wang Dinghua Brigades of the Huang Renhuan Division of the Guangdong army are in Jiaoling, while the Huang Zhiwen Division is</p>
<p>stationed on the border of Jiangxi and is also preparing to enter Fujian. The Second Independent Division of Zhang Ruigui was previously effective in suppressing bandits in Nanshan in the Chaozhou, Puning, and Huilai counties and has now sealed off the entrances to Nanshan, handing over the task of suppressing the fleeing bandits to the guards of the various counties. On the 21st, this division was also ordered to be transferred to Shantou and then to Fengshun and Dabu to increase defenses.</p>
<p>The two regiments of Luo Fengxiang and Chen Tengxiong will depart from the Jieyang-Anbu road to Chaoan. The Chen Yaoshu Teaching Regiment will remain in Chaoyang to suppress the remaining bandits and focus on rear defense. However, before Zhang Ruigui's division was transferred, it was discovered that bandit leader Gu Dacun had fled from Zijin to Nanling again. Zhang's division immediately divided its troops into three routes to encircle him. Chen Tengxiong's regiment attacked from Yunluo, Meilin, Daping, Zhangjiaokeng, and Leigongtan in Huilai. Luo Fengxiang's regiment attacked from Kuitan and Sanjiaokeng in Huilai. Wang's regiment</p>
<p>attacked from Lukouwei in Lufeng. The remnants of Gu's bandits could not withstand the attacks and retreated to Tianzai, Shenkeng, Jinzhubei, and Shibankeng in Huilai. Chen's regiment immediately encircled and suppressed them in Zhangjiaokeng and Shenkeng, immediately attacking Shenkeng, which was the main base of the Red bandits. At the same time, Luo's regiment and Huang's battalion also attacked Tianzai Village. As a result, the bandit forces became even more unable to resist and fled towards Chongqi Mountain. In this battle, over twenty bandits were killed, including four female bandits, and eight Red Guards were captured and executed by firing squad in Kuitan. The remaining bandits scattered and hid in the area of Shixiang. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Report</h3>
<p>The Crimes of Mr. and Mrs. Noulens</p>
<p>There is concrete evidence of aiding the activities of the Communist Party in Tingzhou and Ganzhou</p>
<p>The second defendant is guilty of the same crime as the first defendant</p>
<p>And instructs the Suzhou Higher Court to prosecute</p>
<p>Reuters, Nanjing: The case of Mr. and Mrs. Noulens, who were arrested in the Shanghai International Settlement several months ago and handed over to the Chinese authorities, has been investigated by the Supreme Court. The Central Daily News published the original report of the court this morning, which stated that the two defendants, Mr. and Mrs. Noulens, were indeed in contact with the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan and Jiangxi and were also related to Xiang Zhongfa, a communist who was recently executed in Shanghai. The Supreme Court has sent this report to the Suzhou Higher Court and instructed the Higher Court to prosecute in accordance with this report. The charges include that the two defendants conspired to overthrow the current government. If the court proves that the defendants are guilty of this crime, they should be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court's report briefly states that the Noulens case began in Singapore, where the British authorities reported the activities of the Communist Party to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement. After investigation by the Shanghai police, it was learned that the Communist Party used Post Office Box No. 205 as a communication agency. It was later found that the police at No. 235 Sichuan Road were still secretly investigating the whereabouts of Mr. and Mrs. Noulens in Shanghai. It was then learned that Mr. Noulens had used Post Office Box No. 205 and No. 235 Sichuan Road as his office. Later, the police discovered that Mr. Noulens often went to Room 30, C Building, No. 49 Nanjing Road. On June 15th last year, Mr. Noulens was arrested there. When the police searched the two places on Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road, they found a short French note, which was drafted by the person claiming to be Mrs. Noulens. Mr. Noulens was to meet there on that day, and the police sent detectives to wait there, and Mrs. Noulens was arrested as a result. The police then learned that Mr. and Mrs. Noulens had rented houses on Yuyuan Road and Hed Road. Bank deposit receipts totaling about 40,000 yuan were found during the search, but no communist documents were found. At the same time, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters also stated that the two defendants were related to Xiang Zhongfa, a well-known communist who was recently executed. On August 14th last year, the Garrison Commander handed over the two defendants to the Nanjing Military Court. The Garrison Headquarters later detained several party members who had arrived in Shanghai from Singapore and sent Fu Daqing, whom they had captured, to Nanjing for questioning with Mr. and Mrs. Noulens. On December 17th, the Military Court ruled that the defendants' activities were not within the martial law area, so the court had no jurisdiction. The case was transferred to the Ministry of Justice and forwarded to the Suzhou Higher Court for handling. When the Suzhou Higher Court was examining the case file, the Sino-Japanese War broke out. For the sake of caution, the Ministry of Justice instructed the Suzhou Higher Court to temporarily send the defendants and the case file to Nanjing. On March 18th, the Supreme Court began its investigation. The Supreme Court expressed its agreement with the charge that Mr. Noulens had conspired to overthrow the government and detailed its reasons, stating that 90% of the seized documents were related to communism. The most important document was found in Room 30, C Building, No. 49 Nanjing Road. In addition to being related to communist activities in the Philippines, Malaysia, Korea, India, Annam, and Japan, more than 70 items were related to communist activities within China, divided into three categories: 1) Reports from the Chinese Communist Party to the headquarters; 2) Instructions from the Third International; 3) Documents concerning the Red Army organization and the start of activities among Chinese farmers and workers. From these documents, it can be determined that Room 30, C Building, No. 49 Nanjing Road, was the headquarters of the Third International in China, and it can also be inferred that the person living in that room was the director of the headquarters. Mr. Noulens argued that the office was rented by a person named Alex, who was a student studying German and had already left Shanghai, and that all the documents belonged to Alex, but were only kept by Mr. Noulens. When asked about Alex's whereabouts and details, Mr. Noulens could not give a satisfactory answer. The Supreme Court believed that there were five points that could prove that Mr. Noulens and Alex were actually the same person: 1) Peng Jiatai, the clerk of No. 49 Nanjing Road, stated that Mr. Noulens was the resident of Room 30, C Building, and claimed to be Alex there on December 25, 1930; 2) The landlord's bookkeeper proved that Mr. Noulens was Alex because Mr. Noulens always used Alex's name to pay the rent in person; 3) On March 5, 1930, Mr. Noulens used Alex's name to order plain flannel clothes from the Hexing Tailor Shop on Sichuan Road, and there is an account to be checked; 4) There were three iron boxes in the room, one of which contained US$1,800. Mr. Noulens knew which box the above-mentioned banknotes were placed in, but he did not admit to knowing the contents of the seized communist documents; 5) Handwriting experts proved that Mr. Noulens's handwriting was the same as the handwriting on the seized documents.</p>
<p>From these facts, it can be determined that Mr. Noulens resided in Room 30, C Building, No. 49 Nanjing Road, and that the seized documents belonged to Mr. Noulens. As for Alex, there was no such person, which was obviously Mr. Noulens's pseudonym. Mr. Noulens claimed that he came to China in March 1930 as a representative of a Berlin trading company, but he never made any transactions. Mr. Noulens himself admitted this. Mr. Noulens also claimed that he was a teacher, teaching French and German, but when asked who his students were, he only replied with Alex and another person who rented No. 66 Hed Road and had already left Shanghai. It was found that Mr. Noulens only had this simple occupation, but he had four offices: one at No. 235 Sichuan Road, one at No. 49 Nanjing Road, one at No. 74 Hongyifang, Yuyuan Road, and one at No. 66 Hed Road. Mr. Noulens also used eight post office boxes and registered four telegraph addresses at the China Wireless Telegraph Bureau. Recently, searches of communist party organs in various parts of China have found that Mr. Noulens</p>
<p>had a definite relationship with the Chinese Communist Party's activities, especially the Red Army in Hunan and Jiangxi. Mr. Noulens provided financial assistance and commanded them, so the defendant had acted to overthrow the current government.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court's report continued that, regardless of whether the defendants, male and female, were formally married, the purpose of the second defendant's arrival in China was the same as Mr. Noulens's,</p>
<p>and that she had assisted Mr. Noulens in carrying out communist work and attempting to overthrow the Chinese government, which was obvious. Although the police did not find any communist documents in the second defendant's residence, when the second defendant entered Room 30, C Building, No. 49 Nanjing Road, and witnessed Mr. Noulens being arrested, she tried to escape and claimed that she did not know Mr. Noulens and had mistakenly entered that room. Regarding the issue of the second defendant's nationality, the second defendant changed her testimony repeatedly and could not determine her nationality. However, in Mr. Noulens's office, the police found a French letter that was sent from Singapore on May 27th of the previous year. Although the letter was in code, it was undoubtedly a report sent by a communist party member. The handwriting of the letter was the same as the short French note copied in Room 30, C Building, No. 49 Nanjing Road. The work carried out by the second defendant, who claimed to be Mrs. Noulens, was the same as that of Mr. Noulens, which was obvious, so the punishment she should receive should be equal to that of Mr. Noulens.

<h3>German Professor Studies Funding for Dredging the Yellow River</h3>
<p>To be shared by the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Provincial Government previously received a telegram from Zhu Qinglan and water conservancy expert Li Xie, stating that German Professor Engels was willing to use the machines created in his newly established large experimental field to conduct free research on fundamental dredging methods for the Yellow River (mainly experimenting with water properties and construction dredging), and the travel and material costs required would be 22,000 yuan, which was proposed to be shared by Henan and Shandong provinces. Based on this, the Provincial Government proposed a discussion at the political affairs meeting, deciding to telegraph the Henan Provincial Government to solicit their opinion. According to the reply, this matter concerns the interests of the entire river, and the required expenses should be provided by the state or allocated from the Boxer Indemnity funds, otherwise, they should be shared by the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Today (22nd), the Provincial Government</p>
<p>held another political affairs meeting to discuss the case, resolving that the material costs would be shared by the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, and separate replies have been telegraphed. (April 22nd)</p>
<h3>Jiangbei's Notorious Bandit Executed</h3>
<p>Li Kaitai and others suffer execution</p>
<p>Wei Yousan's faction declines</p>
<p>Huaiyin Correspondence: Bandit leader Li Kaitai was one of the strongmen in Wei Yousan's faction. For several years, he has been wreaking havoc in the counties of Siyang, Suqian, Suining, and Si in Jiangbei, raping, looting, burning, and killing, turning everywhere he went into ruins. Liang Guanying, the commander-in-chief of the 25th Route Army, specially dispatched Wang Xiushen, the brigade commander of the 96th Brigade, to lead troops to suppress them. After months of pursuit, they finally defeated the bandit gang. Li Kaitai, seeing that the situation was unsustainable, secretly went to the home of Chen Huanqing, the village chief of Chenqunqiang Village in Suqian, and was taken in and hidden by Chen's son, Chen Zuotong. Sun Deguang, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Independent Brigade, pursued and captured him.</p>
<p>After interrogation at the Qingjiang Headquarters, he was sentenced to death according to law. At noon on April 16th, the bandit and his accomplice, Chen Zuotong, and Zhang Boren, a notorious bandit from Huaiyin, were tied up and taken to the station</p>
<p>nearby to be executed by firing squad. Li Kaitai was cunning and slippery. Wei Yousan relied on him as his right-hand man. The reason why Wei's faction had not been defeated for a long time was largely due to his efforts. Now that the bandit has been executed, Wei's bandit will inevitably be captured soon. The following is the confession of the bandit: (1) Li Kaitai confessed: "I am 33 years old, from Cuiji, Sixian County. I initially became a bandit with my teacher Wang Shiping for about four or five years. Wang Shiping was Wei Yousan's disciple. After my teacher died, I took his gun, which had about eighty or ninety rifles, one handheld, seven Mauser pistols, and over a hundred men." (2) Chen Zuotong confessed: "I am 20 years old, from Chenqunqiang, Suqian County. Li Kaitai is my father Chen Huanqing's godson. He often stayed at my house. He came on the night of the tenth day of the second month and was arrested on the twelfth day." (3) Zhang Boren confessed: "I am 26 years old, from Daxingzhuang, Huaiyin County. There are over forty of us. I am the leader (bandit leaders in Jiangbei are called 'leader'). I extorted 80 yuan from Han Rentian and 300 yuan from Wang Jing. Sun Kekai gave me 50 yuan less, so I killed him. I have committed many shootings in recent years, and I can't remember the rest."</p>

<p>918th Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held its 98th County Political Affairs Meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu chaired the meeting as scheduled, and resolutions were made on various cases: (1) The County Magistrate submitted a proposal based on a report from the Yu Tang River Works General Office, stating that the Machiao project of the Yu Tang River Works has been completed, and proposing a date for opening the dam. The question is how should it be instructed? (2) The County Construction Bureau proposed an investigation and survey of the section from Zhugang to Machiao of the Yu Tang River Works, which still needs to be excavated, but the dam in Zhugang has already been opened. The question is how should it be handled? The above two items were discussed together, and it was resolved to order the Machiao branch office to truthfully report the situation of the river works and whether the dam was opened without authorization. If the project is sloppy, the branch office should be responsible for hiring workers to excavate. (3) The County Magistrate submitted a proposal based on a report from the County Relocation Design Committee, presenting the expenditure calculation for recurring expenses from December of last year to March of this year. The question is whether it should be approved? It was resolved to approve the case as submitted.</p>

<p>At the Joint Association of China United Apartments on Beijing Road</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai International Senior Target Shooting Competition began, it is unprecedented for the same formidable opponent to compete for the championship three times in a row, as in the case of Chinese Li Gongying versus Portuguese Medina.

However, Medina is also praised by others, who say that his composure is very strong and can deal with everything. What the outcome will be, let's see how the two perform in the finals today and tomorrow before making a decision. The competition is at the Joint Association of China United Apartments on Beijing Road, a total of 2,000 points, divided into two days to complete.

<h3>Request for Rent Exemption by the Pudong Fellow-Countrymen Association Denied</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government replied to the Pudong Fellow-Countrymen Association's petition, saying: "Received the petition. Upon investigation, the collection of rent is a general regulation, only collecting in county towns and prosperous market towns, and exempting those below two yuan. Chuansha County has already reported the full collection, and Fengxian County has also reported the remittance of one thousand yuan, all on record. The request for exemption as an exception is a matter of general regulation and is difficult to approve. Inform accordingly." The reply was dated April 19th.</p>

More than 20 council members were present, including Jiang Wenfang, Lu Rensheng, Wu Xuen, Wang Dejun, Jin Renjian, Gu Shanzhang, Shen Yishi, Wang Yongzhi, etc. Diao Qing'en presided over the meeting. After the formalities were completed, the chairman reported on the following matters: (1) the implementation of the previous resolutions; (2) the contact with the Unified Registration Office; (3) the contact with the Baoshan Disaster Relief Committee regarding the distribution of cotton seeds; (4) the economic situation. Then the following cases were discussed: (1) Mr. Cai Xiangsun's letter requesting to resign from the council membership of this association was resolved to reply to the letter and submit it to the initiators' meeting for deliberation. Before the resolution is made, he should continue to serve. (2) The case of requesting the Post Office General Bureau to restore the postal delivery of the post office in this district as soon as possible was resolved to write to the Post Office General Bureau to handle it. The draft letter is recorded later. (3) The case of stipulating the standards and methods for distributing cotton seeds was resolved as follows: (A) 20 jin will be distributed to each household. (B) Those who have not registered should first register with this association. (C) The distribution location is at the Jiangwan Fire Brigade.

(5) It was resolved to petition the municipal government to quickly provide relief and exempt the land tax in this district, which was unanimously approved. The draft letter to the Postal General Bureau is attached below: Respectfully, since the outbreak of the war in Jiangwan, transportation has been blocked, residents have fled, and postal delivery has been interrupted for two months. Now that the war is about to end, people are flocking back to engage in their businesses. It is only because postal services have not yet been restored that everyone feels inconvenienced. I heard that the villagers in Wusong and Baoshan are talking about the post offices there resuming work as usual, but Jiangwan has not seen any movement so far, so I feel very strange. The Jiangwan disaster is planning to revive the market, and the houses that have been destroyed will be rebuilt as soon as the overall situation is stable, so as to restore the old view. All major postal undertakings in municipal construction should request your bureau to restore them as soon as possible, so as to benefit merchants and facilitate progress. Accordingly, I hereby write to you, hoping that you will investigate accordingly.</p>
<h3>Those Detained on Women's Labor Day</h3>
<p>The Debate Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>On March 8th, it was the International Women's Labor Day. The police were deeply afraid that troublemakers would take the opportunity to disrupt order, so they took extremely strict precautions in advance. Unexpectedly, on the 7th, the police obtained a search warrant No. 4070 from the Second High Branch Court and searched the Guanghua Primary School at No. 1267 Youyuli, Laobai Road. On the upper floor of the house, they found a large number of suspected reactionary flags, slogans, leaflets, etc., and detained eleven people, including men Huang Boyong and Xu Baidu, and women Zheng Ren, Li Guiying, Zhang Xiuying, Li Manli, Wang Aizhen, Zhang Che, Wang Rong, Guo Hui, and Chen Biru. The police prosecuted them in the Second High Branch Court for violating Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Law on Endangering the Party and the Country. This case was briefly interrogated by Judge Song Yuan, and all except the first, second, and ninth defendants, who were considered to have more serious circumstances, were released on bail. Yesterday, Judge Yu carefully reviewed the case. First, the police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, and then each defendant was interrogated one by one. They all claimed to be students at China and Jinan schools, etc., and Chen Biru had just come to Shanghai from Beiping and planned to teach at Wuben. This time, she went to that place at the invitation of a friend, or to ask for the articles of association of Guanghua Primary School. They all denied writing or intending to publicize or disrupt order. Judge Yu then instructed to begin the debate, and the defense lawyers Yuan Yang'an, Ye Changyi, Pan Zhendong, and Shen Xiaoxiang debated one by one. Among them, lawyer Pan Zhenya spoke in a loud voice, with an excited attitude, and his words slightly attacked the police lawyer personally, so the police lawyer also stood up to clarify his responsibilities, and the court also advised him. The case is now scheduled to be sentenced on May 2nd. The defendants who were not allowed bail were still remanded, and the rest were released on their original bail.</p>
<h3>Searching for the Missing Gu Lao Si</h3>
<p>Gu Lao Si, from Yangzhou, 34 years old, male, used to live on Gordon Road, now living in Hongkou, suffering from mental illness, suddenly disappeared a few days ago. His brother, Gu Ziqiang, is now working at the Special Zone Court and is extremely anxious to hear about it. If anyone knows his whereabouts, please send him back, which would be a great blessing.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Tenants' Meeting in Mingyuanfang, Huade Road</h3>
<p>Resolutely Demanding a Three-Month Rent Exemption</p>
<p>All the tenants of Mingyuanfang, Huade Road, Yangshupu, suffered extremely heavy losses because they were in the war zone and close to the front line. They requested the landlord to exempt them from three months' rent and postpone the payment of arrears. Therefore, they convened a general meeting of all tenants at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 tenants attended the meeting, and Wu Junzhi was elected as chairman and Gao Xiqin as secretary. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) This workshop is less than two li from Baziqiao, only about half a li from the Japanese army headquarters and the airport of the Donghua Yarn Factory, and less than one li from Huishan Wharf, and has suffered particularly severely from the war. There are many unemployed and life is difficult. They unanimously entrusted lawyer Zhou Xiao'an to write to lawyer Zhang Jiawei, the representative of the landlord, on behalf of them, and strongly requested the landlord to understand the tenants' difficulties and follow the precedent of Henglili (Real Estate Department of Kenye Bank) on Dongxi Huade Road, etc., to exempt the rent for February, March, and April of this year for three months. In the future, the rent will be deposited in the bank by the tenants, depending on the situation. (2) Please allow the landlord to postpone the payment of rent arrears, so as to maintain the rest of their lives after the disaster. (3) Zhou Yuantian, Gu Yushun, Tang Baoshan, Li Ruisheng, and Gao Xiqin were elected as the full representatives of all the tenants of this workshop to handle all matters. Other matters were discussed and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Zhang Juying Donates "Common Sense of Children's Diseases"</h3>
<p>After the war, coupled with the unfavorable weather, children are weak and prone to illness, especially measles and smallpox. In previous years, measles was very easy to treat, but not this year. Often, after the rash appears, it turns into severe pneumonia due to improper treatment. The symptoms include rapid breathing, flared nostrils, diarrhea, etc., which are very dangerous. Mr. Zhang Juying, in view of this, has specially donated a copy of "Common Sense of Children's Diseases" to all sectors for reference. The book describes in detail the essentials of treatment and methods of care. By following the methods, the risk of disease change can be avoided. Mr. Zhang lives at No. 12, Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, Zhejiang Road, Laolajiqiao South. Those who need this book can go to ask for it in person. However, those who request it in this port must attach two cents for postage, and those in other ports must attach four cents for postage.</p>
<h3>A Robbery on Caishi Road Last Night</h3>
<p>Jin Songtao, a local, is a vegetable seller living at No. 113 Shuxiang Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession. At about 9:00 PM last night, seven robbers suddenly came, each holding a pistol, forbidding anyone to make a sound. They robbed clothing and silver dollars, totaling about 300 yuan, and fled through the door with the stolen goods. The owner chased after them, and at that time, Detectives Zhang Daorong, Su Deshan, and Cui Zhendong of the French Police were patrolling and joined the chase. As a result, one of them was intercepted and taken to the police station.</p>
<p>He also confessed that there were accomplices hiding in Room No. 1 of the Chunjiang Inn. They went to arrest them according to the address</p>
<p>and captured six more people, who were detained separately, waiting to be sent to the court for strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Four Robbers Failed to Rob</h3>
<p>Two Were Intercepted on the Spot</p>
<p>At about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, four robbers suddenly came to a secondhand shop inside a bamboo fence opposite Bulin Lane on Zhengjia Muqiao Street, French Concession. They were about to rob when the shop owner noticed and shouted for help. Passersby gathered and arrested two of them, and a loaded pistol was found on one of the robbers. They were sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Case of Xue Zhenyi's Attempted Murder</h3>
<p>The Police Prosecuted Him According to the Law on Punishing Bandits</p>
<p>Xue Zhenyi, a 28-year-old man from Xuzhou, who lived at No. 233 and a half Ruian Lane, Shanhai Pass Road, Public Concession, and was the dismissed captain of the Second Team of the Chinese Red Cross Rescue Team, went to the home of his former colleague Hai Zongqi (captain of the First Team of the Red Cross Rescue Team), a Henan native, at No. 112 Pushi Road, French Concession, at 11:00 AM on the 23rd of this month and forcibly demanded a loan of 500 yuan. When he failed, he fired three shots, intending to kill Hai. Fortunately, he did not hit him and turned around and fled. Hai and his family chased him out and called for help. Xue fired three more shots along the way to resist arrest, wounding three pedestrians, Gu Fulin, Shen Ruijin, and the girl Zhu Fuliang. He fled into the home of Chen Zhenglin at No. 25 Juxing Lane, Beidi Road, took off his coat, and abandoned his pistol. He also climbed over the wall and fled to the intersection of Dagu Road and Chengdu Road, where he was intercepted by Chinese police officer No. 3126 of the Public Concession. The French Police sent Detective Zhang Ziying to bring Xue back and</p>
<p>recover the coat and pistol (the bullets had been fired). He was taken to the police station to await investigation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police sent Xue to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Zone District Court. Judge Li Changnian and Secretary Tao Zongkan sat in court for interrogation. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case, roughly saying that the defendant went to the plaintiff's home with a gun on the 23rd, using violent and coercive means to demand a loan unsuccessfully, and then attempted to kill him, firing three shots and fleeing. He fired shots on the road to resist arrest, wounding three pedestrians. He is now prosecuted according to Article 1, Paragraph 12 of the Law on Punishing Bandits. However, the police investigation is not yet complete, and they requested a postponement for further investigation. Then, the plaintiff Hai Zongqi stated the situation of the defendant's arrival at his home to forcibly demand money and fire shots.</p>
<p>The defendant confessed that after graduating from the Northeast Jiangwu Hall, he worked in the military, and after being dismissed, he joined the Chinese Red Cross as a rescue team leader, etc.</p>
<p>The lawyer hired by the defendant objected to the police's application of the Law on Punishing Bandits. Judge Li announced a postponement pending further investigation by the police, and the defendant was remanded.</p>
<h3>Two Hundred and Forty Taels of Opium in a Galvanized Iron Box</h3>
<p>Using Iron Pipe to Store Oil as a Concealment</p>
<p>Clever Mechanism Still Exposed</p>
<p>At about 11:00 AM yesterday, Wu Minzhen, the police chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, and detectives patrolled the river to the Taikoo Wharf in Pudong and saw a small steamboat moored outside the Wuchang steamship. They immediately boarded the ship for inspection and saw two galvanized iron boxes placed next to a passenger named Li Dong from Hunan. There was a small hole on the surface of the box, through which oil could be seen inside. They forced Li to ask if the box belonged to him. Li denied it, so they used an iron skewer to poke into the side of the box, pulled it out, and smelled it. They smelled opium, so they opened the box and found two bags of opium hidden inside, weighing a total of about 240 taels. There was also a small galvanized iron pipe containing crude oil, one end attached to the bottom of the box, and the other end placed under the small hole on the surface of the box. From the outside, it seemed that only oil was stored in the box, and no one suspected that there was another secret mechanism inside. The intention was very clever. Because Li Dong was highly suspected, he was immediately taken to the team along with the evidence. Under the preliminary interrogation by the brigade leader Liang, he was ordered to prepare a document to send to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Concubine of the Dead Robber Was a Waitress at Sincere Amusement Park</h3>
<p>Younger Sister Also Detained</p>
<p>Wang Yaotang Narrates the Investigation Process</p>
<p>Shao Jingfan, a detective from the Xinzha Police Station, took Tianfu, a robber who robbed Chengdu Road, to search for guns at the place of his accomplices on the morning of the 23rd. When passing Yude Lane on Guangxi Road, the robber suddenly took advantage of the detective's unpreparedness and struck him with a gun. Detective Shao was injured on the spot, and the robber Tianfu was also killed immediately. The details have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the police sent the robber's concubine Song Guiying (</p>
<p>26 years old) and Song's younger sister Qiu Renfeng (19 years old) to the First District Court of the Special Zone, where Judge Feng Shide heard the case. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that after the robbery on Chengdu Road, the police knew that there was still a robber named Tianfu at large. After investigation, they learned that the robber had a concubine named Song Guiying, who worked as a waitress at Sincere Amusement Park. On the evening of the 22nd, they saw Song and Qiu leaving Sincere Amusement Park together, so they followed them to No. 6 Shoulu Lane, Dongxinqiao, French Concession, and learned that they lived in the French Concession. The next morning, they saw Song and Qiu going to the small vegetable market on Zhejiang Road to buy vegetables. At that time, the two women and an old woman at a tofu stall were talking about Tianfu's affairs. The old woman was Tianfu's second landlord at No. 844 Parker Road before he committed the crime. They were taken to the police station.</p>
<p>They confessed that Tianfu lived at No. 6 Shoulu Lane. The police sent Chinese detectives No. 109 and Qiu Jingfan to arrest him. When they arrived there, the robber had not yet gotten up, and the robber's attitude was very calm. He requested that his hands be cuffed slowly because he still wanted to put on clothes. The detectives cuffed one of his hands. When he finished putting on his clothes, he</p>
<p>said that there were still pistols and other things deposited somewhere on Guangxi Road. The detectives took him to retrieve the guns. When they were about to go out, the robber said that he still wanted to put on a coat. At first, he thought that there was a pistol hidden in his coat. When they arrived at Yude Lane on Guangxi Road, he falsely claimed that the destination had arrived. Shao Jingfan, the detective, held the robber's handcuff with one hand and grabbed the robber's collar with the other hand and walked. However, the robber took advantage of the fact that one of his hands was not yet cuffed and pulled out a pistol from his coat pocket and fired three shots at Shao. The detectives behind</p>
<p>were inconvenient to fight back, because Detective Shao was next to him at the same time, and they were afraid of hurting him. When Shao fell to the ground, they immediately shot and killed the robber. The robber's body was examined at the autopsy station yesterday morning. The police prosecuted Song Guiying and Qiu Renfeng for helping the robbers under Article 44 of the Criminal Law. They are now requesting detention, pending further verification after the autopsy. Judge Feng briefly interrogated the two women, because they had to go to the autopsy station together, and because the two robbers who robbed the colleagues of the victim had been captured, today is the date for Judge Wu to hear the case, so he ordered that the cases be heard together.</p>
<h3>Pregnant Woman Dies After Mistakenly Taking Sanxian Dan for Abortion</h3>
<p>Mrs. Wei Wu, a 33-year-old woman from Suzhou, who lived at No. 102 Xiamen Road, had been having an affair with a man nicknamed Huangzhou Lao Zhu. Later, because she was three months pregnant and her abdomen was gradually enlarging, she was afraid that her husband would find out, so on March 18th, she went to Mrs. Jin Wang at No. 16 Zhifu Road and asked her to perform an abortion. At that time, Mrs. Jin Wang and another midwife, Tang Yu, performed the operation, and the fetus was aborted, but she had severe abdominal pain, which became increasingly severe. Under resentment, she suddenly had a suicidal thought, so on the 15th of this month, she secretly swallowed the poisonous Sanxian Dan in an attempt to end her life. Her cohabiting woman, Wu Cai, found out and sent her to Guangren Hospital. On one side, the hospital reported to the Laozha Police Station and sent a detective to arrest Jin Wang and Tang Yu and send them to the First District Court of the Special Zone. The details of the interrogation have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that Mrs. Wei Wu died on the afternoon of the day before yesterday due to deep poisoning and ineffective treatment after being sent to the hospital. The body was taken to the Fei Lun Road autopsy station. Yesterday morning, Li</p>
<p>Ying, the prosecutor of the First District Court of the Special Zone, came to the station to examine the body. He sat in the public seat and the police brought Jin Wang to the case. She confessed that she only ordered the deceased to take Tongjingcao Honghua and other medicines because she had stopped menstruating and was not pregnant. According to Wu Cai, she and the deceased were cohabiting. She lived on the third floor and she lived on the second floor. On the 16th of this month, she told me that she was still in good health after the abortion. Today, after I washed the clothes, she suddenly had abdominal pain and said that she had taken Sanxian Dan and ordered me to ask a doctor. Then she was sent to the hospital, etc. Li Jun got the confession and sent it to the autopsy. The deceased woman Wei Wu was indeed poisoned to death by mistakenly taking Sanxian Dan before her death. The body was handed over to the son of the corpse, Wei Jinde, to sign and take back for coffin burial.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Appeal to the Authorities</h3>
<p>Requesting Reduction or Exemption of New Car Rental</p>
<p>There are more than 27,000 rickshaw pullers in this city. Their hard work and difficult life are unmatched by workers in other industries. Since the Shanghai incident, the border between the Chinese and foreign concessions and the main roads have been filled with obstacles such as gauze bags and barbed wire, resulting in traffic disruptions. Also, due to the early curfew and the closure of shops to resist the enemy, the rickshaw pullers' business has plummeted. However, the financiers such as Sanxin and Feixing companies do not sympathize with the rickshaw pullers who survived the war, but instead increased the car rental by five cents, totaling eight cents and five cents. After passing through the hands of large and small contractors, the rickshaw pullers have to pay 13 cents and five cents. The rickshaw pullers' representatives Meng Jinchen, etc., specially submitted a petition to the municipal government, the municipal party headquarters, and the social bureau yesterday, requesting a clear order to reduce the car rental, and asking all sectors to sympathize and provide assistance. It is reported that the party and government organs, after receiving the petition, will jointly discuss relief measures to alleviate the workers' difficulties.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Respectfully, after reading today's issue of your newspaper, it said that our staff member Sun Wenqiu was stabbed at the Great World last night. After investigation, there is no one named Sun Wenqiu among our staff, nor has there been any stabbing. Only a tea servant named A Jin was stabbed last night at the Great World. I hereby inform you specially, hoping that you will investigate and correct it to reflect the truth. Sincerely, the General Affairs Department of Shanghai Jin Cheng Bank, April 25th, Year 21,</p>
<p>I have just read a news item in your newspaper about a feud at the Great World, saying that the murderer Song Zhigao had worked in Bansong Garden. After investigation, there is no such person in our garden, nor in the commercial arena. I think the rumors are inaccurate, so I hereby submit a letter for correction to clarify the truth. This is my sincere prayer to the chief writer of the Shen Bao. Bansong Garden, April 25th.</p>

<h3>Ways to Manage</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>If one is willing to manage worldly affairs, there is always a way. Except for turning men into women or achieving immortality, there is absolutely nothing that cannot be managed. The words "there's no way" are actually a euphemism for "unwilling to manage." Consider that the world has existed for tens of thousands of years, with countless events occurring. Even if one claims there's no way, the way to manage the "no way" is still a way to manage. So, there is still a way. For example, Zen Buddhism speaks of not establishing words, yet it establishes words. Methods certainly differ in quality, but one must understand that good or bad is the result of the method. One cannot say that</p>
<p>a good result means there was a way, and a bad result means there was no way. Based on this reasoning, the term "no way" naturally cannot be established. Because for every matter, there must be a way. To put it more simply, a matter is not just one person's matter, so the way is not just one person's way. If others think there's no way, but I believe there is a way, then I use my way to defeat their "no way." I then take full responsibility to manage it. This is one way. Sometimes, I feel there's no way, but others all say there is a way. This means my "no way" is defeated by their way. I should then know better and let them manage it. This is another way. If neither of these works, then have no self-opinion, no other-opinion, merge self and others, unite knowledge and action, and everyone seeks a way out of "no way," managing things with united hearts and efforts. This is yet another way, and the best way. The worst is when I myself have no way but insist on preventing others from having a way. This is truly called "no way to manage." But judging the matter on its merits, it's still not "no way." This is a way to talk about ways to manage.</p>
<h3>A Loyal and Righteous Monk</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>During the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates raided the southeastern provinces, advancing from Zha Pu to invade Jiaxing. They hid the women, children, and wealth they looted along the way in the Chachan Temple, about three miles west of Jiaxing's West Gate, to indulge themselves. Later, they were ordered to attack Tongxiang. When they withdrew their flags, they locked the women and children in a secret room in the temple and assigned soldiers to guard them. The temple monk Miaodi, while chanting scriptures, heard the miserable cries of the women and children and was moved to a thought of saving them. So, he bought wine to treat the guarding soldiers. When they were drunk, he released all the women and children. The people were grateful for his virtue and urged him to flee with them. The monk feared that when the guarding soldiers woke up, with no one to lie for them, they would be pursued, making it difficult to escape danger. He was willing to sacrifice himself to save the people, firmly ordering them to flee quickly. The people then scattered. Shortly after, the guarding soldiers woke up, saw that the women and children had all escaped, and asked what happened. Miaodi lied, saying he had just seen Weituo striking the door with a whip, releasing all the people. The power of Buddhism was boundless and hard to resist. The guarding soldiers were half-believing, half-doubting. Because he was tired and weak from his hangover, they could not pursue them far. They arrested Miaodi to await orders. Later, the leader who attacked Tongxiang returned and inquired about this matter. Knowing what Miaodi had done, he tied him to the stone archway outside the temple, first ordering each soldier to shoot arrows wildly, and then piled firewood to burn his body, causing a bloodstain to remain on the stone archway. More than three hundred years have passed, and the stain has not faded.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, when Wei Daofeng was the magistrate of Jiaxing, he admired his loyalty and righteousness. Fearing that the event would be forgotten over time, he specially erected a stele to record the event. Recently, because the traitors in Zhabei helped the Japanese to deceive their compatriots, how is it that people today are not as good as the ancients? Therefore, Miaodi's righteous act is publicized to encourage the people.</p>
<h3>World Snippets</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>In the aviation schools established by the Soviet Russian government, female students account for 20%. Almost every school is like this. In the future, there will definitely be many female aviators, creating amazing achievements. Someone in Bedfordshire, England, has devised a new method of catching mice. He put a small mirror in a mousetrap and caught thirty mice in a week.</p>
<p>In Munich, Germany, a citizen copied two poems and a novella of eight thousand one hundred words on both sides of an ordinary postcard. The smallness of the handwriting can be imagined. It is impossible to read without the aid of a microscope.</p>
<p>London now has four hundred and forty-five large cinemas, with a total of three hundred and eighty-four thousand eight hundred and fifty seats. Every day, three hundred and eighty-four thousand eight hundred and fifty people can be accommodated to watch movies. According to an investigation by the Education Committee, no matter what kind of film, it does not have any actual harm to children. So, children can watch more movies on weekdays.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai War and Military Equipment (20)</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>Communication devices are originally the lifeline of the military. In military terms, they are mostly transmitted by humans and electricity, or delivered by dogs and pigeons. And they are nothing more than two kinds: visual and auditory. Among the visual communication methods, there is a heliograph, which transmits and receives messages by flickering light. The distance of communication is distinguished by day and night according to the type. Today, the main body of communication organs mostly relies on electrical methods, such as wired telegraphs and telephones, wireless telegraphs and telephones, optical telephones, picture telegraphy, Television, etc. Wired communication devices are mainly small, lightweight, and sturdy. Recent telegraph machines include display machines, relay communication machines, printing telegraph machines, automatic telegraph machines, and high-frequency telegraph machines. Telephone sets are mainly vibrating type and bell type. There are also high-frequency telephone sets, long-distance telephone sets, and throat microphones. The throat microphone is installed in a gas mask or inside a tank to avoid noise interference. It is worn on the vocal cord part of the throat to transmit speech.</p>
<p>Military wireless communication devices can be divided into three types: fixed type, ground force type, and aviation type. During this Shanghai War, the Japanese army used vacuum tube wireless radios, distributed to the front-line positions, to connect battlefield communications. Also, in the consulate and headquarters, long-wave and short-wave types were installed to connect with various front-line positions. The airborne wireless radio transmitter installed on the aircraft is the Taisho 13 vacuum tube type machine. However, this machine must cooperate with the artillery in order to achieve greater effectiveness in observation, shooting, and reconnaissance. In recent years, wireless radio science has progressed daily. New short wavelengths and ultra-short wavelengths have been invented. Therefore, the communication devices used on military aircraft have also been greatly improved.</p>
<p>There are many other military equipment, such as warships, torpedoes, mines, bulletproof gear, etc. They are too numerous to list. Due to the limited space, they are all omitted. In the future, after my book "Modern Scientific Warfare" is completed, it will be published to the world. (End)</p>
<h3>Record of the Double Towers of Military Affairs (35)</h3>
<p>— Seeking Happiness, Master Qi</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Betrayal and Severance of Friendship, Unfortunately Encountering a Generous Guest, Impassioned Confinement, the Most Difficult Plan to Endure the Grace of a Beauty</p>
<p>An Da Kui was assigned to take care of the army and, by the way, took a few days off to go home and visit. Who knew that on this day, he was idle at home when suddenly a guard from the stockade gate brought in a tall man, saying that Niu Heifeng sent him to deliver a message that he would arrive this afternoon. Niu Heifeng was passing through Baozhuang and wanted to personally visit Mr. An and Mr. An San. An Da Kui was surprised by this news and suddenly became suspicious. He secretly discussed with An Da Cheng, saying, "Niu Heifeng is so bold. There is an army suppressing bandits not far from here. What is he doing coming to our place? But since he has come, we cannot but receive him. It is best if you go to appease him. I now belong to the side of the army suppressing bandits. It is inconvenient for me to meet him. I'd better go back to camp immediately and avoid him." After speaking, he hurriedly rode away on horseback. Several hours later, Niu Heifeng brought a dozen plainclothes followers. He arrived on time. At the</p>
<p>gate of the stockade, he dismounted and greeted An Dacheng, who was waiting by the roadside, with clasped fists and a respectful greeting. They entered the stockade together, going straight to the large living room of An Dacheng's residence. Niu Heifeng looked around and asked bluntly, "Where is Brother San?" An Dacheng hesitated slightly. Niu Heifeng laughed and said, "Brother, you don't have to be vague. I already received the news that Brother San is involved in military affairs. What's the big deal? Are we brothers who have been friends for so many years not going to</p>
<p>see each other again because of this relationship?" An Dacheng hurriedly smiled and said, "To be honest, Third Brother did come home. But the person you sent to deliver the message was a step late. He left at dawn. He's just making a living outside. Why should there be any separation? Fortunately, I'm here to entertain you. It's the same. Please don't be a stranger." After these polite words, he immediately prepared a table of good wine and food to entertain this generous guest. During the meal, Niu Heifeng talked and laughed, and told An Dacheng many casual stories, boasting about how strong his skills were and how he didn't care about the bucket-like army suppressing bandits. If he was happy to visit friends, he should be free to come and go. No one can do anything to him. After the meal, Niu Heifeng immediately got up to say goodbye. An Liucheng did not insist on keeping him, and personally escorted him outside the stockade to say farewell.</p>

In retrospect, it finally rose by more than three taels. Initially, it was expected to fall back due to the silver market rising for three consecutive days yesterday. Therefore, it immediately rose. Later, due to one bank frequently purchasing</p>
<p>over 500 bars of spot goods, suddenly exceeding 720 taels, presumably because foreign exchange tended to strengthen. However, sellers in the market were not idle and slightly weakened again.

<h3>Foreign Cents See New Low Prices Again</h3>
<p>Seven Qian, Zero Cent, One Li, Seven Hao and a Half</p>
<p>Market Overview: Since the foreign cent falling trend reached a record low on the 13th of this month, it has gradually stabilized, with some expansion and contraction, but still revolving around the two-li minimum price range. The authorities, aware of the inappropriateness of excessively low cent prices, have tried to save it. Unexpectedly, yesterday it could not be forced and actually went off track, which was beyond our expectations. The future trend is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Cent and Tael Prices [Foreign Cent] The morning market was lower than the afternoon market of the previous day by eight hao and seven and a half, at seven qian, zero cent and two li, already reaching the previous lowest price. Unexpectedly, the afternoon market went even lower, at seven qian, zero cent, one li, seven hao and a half. Although it was only a small decline of two hao and a half, this low price is rare since the price of cents began. [Silver Tael] The morning and afternoon markets were still one qian. The bank's listed price was also four fen, with the head added to the water because the silver base was slightly stronger, so there was a two-qian market. However, the result at the close was still only eight or nine fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation: Due to the lack of transactions in Jiangnan small foreign coins, even if there were any, they were few, so the market price generally fell. The morning market was six qian, zero cent and two li, falling another one li from the previous day. There were no transactions in the afternoon market, so the price did not move. Transactions in the morning market were 2,500 jiao. Guangdong small foreign coins also followed the cent price downstream. The morning market was six qian, zero cent, four li, two hao and a half. The afternoon market was six qian, zero cent, three li, three hao and seven and a half. Transactions in the morning market were 95,000 jiao and in the afternoon market were 30,000 jiao. Copper coins were reduced by 500 wen, to 415,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Yuan Inflow and Outflow [Silver Funds] The transaction of cash shops discounting drafts yesterday was slightly more than the previous day, totaling over 1.8 million. Silver companies collected and remitted over 36 million. Silver head funds collected and remitted over 3.2 million. The bank collected and remitted about 3.7 million from Chinese merchants, 4.8 million from foreign merchants, and 5.23 million from various goods, foreign exchange remittances, customs duties, and mortgage foreign funds. Loans were 1 million. [Foreign Funds] Remittances made 480,000 in the morning market and 315,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 50,000 in the morning market and 20,000 in the afternoon market. Vouchers were 20,000 in the morning market and 45,000 in the afternoon market. Bank transactions were 400,000 in the morning market and 350,000 in the afternoon market. Various banks' foreign accounts received and remitted over 1.2 million. Banknote inflow and outflow were 670,000. Small cash shops' transactions were over 500,000.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Bonds Are Still Being Brewed</p>
<p>Prices of Various Bonds Rebound by About Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange closed, three months have passed in a flash. Now, with the situation easing, all parties are brewing to resume business and hope to see the market open as soon as possible. However, due to not receiving instructions from the Ministry of Finance, a decision cannot be made. Now that the end of the month is approaching, the previous futures swap transactions must be disposed of. It is heard that the current method is still to handle the settlement and swap in two ways, and then observe the market situation to determine whether to open the market or not. As for the situation of various bonds in the black market yesterday, because people's hearts were slightly better, the prices rebounded firmly compared to the end of last week, but the ups and downs were still small. Except for the whole six reorganization prices, there was no change, and the rest rose by about half a yuan.</p>

<p>Commission Increase Issue Postponed</p>
<p>The opening date of the exchange's standard cotton yarn market has been set for May 2nd. There is also talk of changes to the cotton yarn standard. For cotton yarn, the sale of fine yarn on the market has recently been the most lively, and now as the era is evolving, the cotton yarn standard has been changed to 20 count. The cotton standard has been changed to Zhengzhou fine lint. Both cotton yarn standards have been raised one level compared to before. The previous report contained</p>
<p>the issue of increasing commissions. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00, brokers convened a meeting, and it was heard that the increase has been temporarily postponed.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Are Unlikely to Improve</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still depressed. The actual needs of guest merchants are unusually desolate, because the economy is exhausted and the situation in the interior is becoming more difficult. Therefore, the purchasing power is greatly weakened, and the season is gradually entering a quiet phase. The hope for yarn sales is extremely small. The current selling price of yarn is particularly difficult to stabilize. Although the factories have the intention to sell at a concession,</p>
<p>it is still difficult to arouse the purchasing desire of all parties. The future situation still cannot escape a tragic situation. According to statistics, all the gangs bought only 300 bales throughout the day, and the market price fell by about five qian. The guest gangs imported 120 bales from the North Gang, 15 bales from Anqing, 45 bales from Guangdong, 30 bales from the interior, 25 bales from Ningbo, 30 bales from Shantou, and 30 bales from the same industry. Shenxin still has scattered sales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Is Quiet and Silent</h3>
<p>The actual need for cotton is becoming more and more silent. The situation of foreign cotton is softening, and its shape is still bad. But the exchange rate is difficult to rise, and people's minds are still flat. The factories' willingness to import is slackened. Therefore, the price of yarn falls without end, and the stored yarn becomes thicker. And the finance is very tight. The attitude of each factory is extremely scattered.</p>
<h3>All India Cotton Field Forecast</h3>

<h3>Mumbai Cotton Industry Weekly News</h3>
<p>Last week, the futures market was firm due to speculators buying in. Later, due to the industry's unwillingness to buy, it suddenly fell. There was not much trading in Europe and the Far East. Although there were few sell-offs, the industry only bought what they urgently needed. Business was sluggish and both sides were taking a wait-and-see attitude. Local factories had spot goods imported, but export demand was flat. The appendix is last week's statistics as follows: (Unit: Thousands of Bales)</p>
<p>1931 1923</p>
<p>Accumulated Receipts Since September 1 2,689 1,384</p>

<h3>Tianjin Cotton Exports to Japan Increased Sharply in 20 Years</h3>
<p>Since a sudden change occurred in Tianjin last year, the market of the Tianjin Cotton Exchange was temporarily suspended. Afterwards, the situation calmed down, and Japan banned gold exports, causing the exchange rate to fall sharply. Recently, it has been buying cotton vigorously in Tianjin. It is estimated that 56,370 bales of cotton were exported to Japan in December, the largest amount since 1926. It is estimated that there were 60,900 bales in November 1926. This year, the cotton harvest in North China is still good, and the price is low, arousing the desire of the Japanese to buy, and there have been many transactions. It is estimated that the amount exported to Japan in one year actually reached 330,632 bales.</p>
<h3>The Silk and Tea Market of Qimen Remains as Lively as Before</h3>
<p>More than two hundred tea firms have opened in Qimen. Qimen black tea, known for its excellent quality and flavor, enjoys smooth overseas sales. Last year, most tea merchants in the area profited, with tribute tea being the most lucrative. This year, tea merchants in Qimen and tea houses in Shanghai are paying special attention to Qimen tea. Chinese and foreign tea merchants alike are focusing their attention here. Initially, last month, various firms were hesitant to open due to tight credit. Tea houses were also cautious with lending. However, driven by profit, they explored every possible means to open despite financial difficulties. Fortunately, Shanghai merchants opened this month, and the financial sector agreed to provide loans to support the silk and tea industries, revitalizing the financial situation. The tea houses that are sending money up the mountains include Hong Yuan Yong, Shen Yuan, Zhong Xin Chang, Yuan Feng Run, Gong Sheng Yong, and Sheng Chang Sheng, six in total. In the past ten days, these tea houses have extended loans amounting to over one million yuan.</p>
<p>Thanks to this financial support, tea merchants on both the Qimen and Fuliang routes are showing signs of vigor. To date, no less than two hundred tea firms have opened. The market is as lively as in previous years.</p>
<p>Tunxi tea merchants are optimistic about the future of green tea. Tunxi tea merchants are optimistic because Shanghai's tea inventory is sold out and the United States is boycotting Japanese goods, which will reduce Japanese tea sales. Additionally, tea production in Jiangxi and Hubei provinces is declining. Therefore, they are very optimistic about the future of green tea this year. Although tea houses are not issuing many bills, Tunxi banks are providing substantial financial support to tea firms. As a result, more than sixty tea firms have rented premises in Tunxi in the past month. If peace negotiations in Shanghai materialize soon, the Tunxi tea market could expand further. Tunxi banks are actively transferring silver from Shanghai and Hangzhou to provide immediate financial assistance due to the demand for funds in the tea industry. Recently, Shanghai bills are selling for over 1,380 yuan per thousand taels, boosting market momentum.</p>
<h3>Tea News from Anhui and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Wuyuan green tea is showing "green tips." Due to the cold weather this spring, tea buds in the Zhouyuan area of Wuyuan County are developing slowly. Recently, the weather has turned warmer, with alternating sunshine and rain. Tea trees facing the sun are showing "green tips," indicating good flavor and quality. Tea farmers are focusing on nurturing and fertilizing the plants to encourage growth and increase yields. If the weather continues to be favorable for the next ten days, tea gardens can be opened around the Beginning of Summer. Tea firms in various villages are busy preparing to open as the new tea season approaches. However, due to tight credit this year and limited lending from tea houses, the number of firms is expected to be lower than last year. Several tea firms from the Northeast have relocated to Tunxi to streamline transportation and production.</p>
<p>Tea funds robbed in Fuliang. Red tea in the Qimen and Fuliang areas is currently entering the market. Tea firms are transporting silver from Jingdezhen and Tunxi, creating a continuous flow along the roads. Recently, robbers in Gaowu and Baimaogang in Fuliang County learned that large sums of tea money were being transported. They surrounded and robbed tea firms, stealing 7,000 yuan in silver. Alerted by this news, firms are on guard. Given the large amount of cash needed during the tea season, they have jointly sent a letter to the Qimen-Fuliang Tea Industry Association, requesting them to ask the authorities of both counties to investigate and provide greater protection to ensure the safety of tea merchants.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Spring Silkworm and Yarn Flower are Excellent</h3>
<p>Continuous rain and cold weather cause uneven silkworm molting during the second sleep stage.</p>
<p>This year, due to financial difficulties, farmers in various towns and villages of Shaoxing are raising very few spring silkworms. The number of silkworm eggs hatched is only 30-40% of previous years. After the silkworms hatched, the weather was sunny and warm, and their development was smooth. They are currently undergoing their second molt. However, recent continuous rain and cold weather have caused uneven molting. Some silkworms are weak and unable to get up, causing anxiety among silkworm farmers.</p>
<h3>Foreign Silk Merchants are Pessimistic</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in Shanghai was completely stagnant. No silk telegrams were received from Europe and America. European merchants, aware of the volatile overseas silk market, are reluctant to take risks and purchase. There is a market with no sales and the future of the silk market is exceptionally pessimistic.</p>
<h3>With Sunny Weather, the Rice Market in the Pudong Area of Shanghai Remains Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only forty to fifty boats arrived at the western route of the South Market, causing a sharp drop in activity. The cargo volume approached one thousand *dan* (unit of dry measure), and shops were unwilling to add more to their stock, greatly affecting merchants. The price of Suzhou-Tongxiang and Pingli *jeng* (glutinous rice) rice opened three *jiao* lower. There were increasing shipments of early and late rice, but demand was low, and prices fell by one and a half *jiao*. The prices of *yanglu jian* (foreign reed tip rice) and *bianyin yuan* rice remained unchanged.</p>
<p>In the North Market, around the Old Garbage Bridge, about forty boats arrived yesterday. There was still no improvement in the retail sales of Zhongguan *bai jeng* (white glutinous rice). Shopkeepers were reserved, and the market appeared sluggish. Qingyong, Sisong, and thin rice were ignored, and prices dropped another one or two *jiao*. Shipments of *bianyin yuan* rice were not strong, but wine merchants were slightly active. The market was neither rising nor falling. The supply of Changxi *ding* (top-grade) goods was severely lacking, and prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales are Strong in the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Small *Jiao* Rice Jumps One *Jiao*, Breaking the 10 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>It is said that 30,000 passports for the northern Jiangsu have been issued.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw strong sales along the Yangtze River. Sales in Chongming and northern Jiangsu were especially good. Shipments to Hankou also continued. Total transactions amounted to over 20,000 bags, and prices rose by one *jiao*. Small *Jiao* rice jumped above the 10 yuan mark, reaching 10.04 to 10.05 yuan for the best quality and 9.89 to 9.47 yuan for the medium to lower grades. One shop on this street sold 500 bags of Saigon rice at 11.27 yuan, which was also one *jiao* higher than the previous day. In addition to Saigon rice, the shop also purchased and stockpiled Small *Jiao* rice. Because prices are cheap, many customers are interested in buying from the market, so the market is quite active. If there are strong sales again today and tomorrow, market prices should improve further. It is rumored that the demand for rice in northern Jiangsu is very high, and the government has issued passports for 30,000 bags. Yesterday's transactions of Small *Jiao* rice were part of these 30,000 bags, and shipments must continue.</p>
<h3>Spot Flour Has a Chance of Holding Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market showed signs of stabilizing. Spot goods for this month appear to be in demand, and shops in this street and customer shops are buying, so opening prices are very stable, with only about two and a half *li* (monetary unit) difference, ranging from 2.095 to 2.0975 *liang* (unit of weight). Sometimes, due to strong or weak buying interest, there is a fluctuation of 2.5 *li*. Due to weak buying interest for May deliveries and the large amount of supply in the market, prices are 2.5 *li* lower than the previous day, generally ranging from 2.0975 *liang* to 2.10 *qian* (unit of weight). Based on recent developments, because factory prices are still asking for 2.15 *qian* less, spot goods in the market should be able to hold steady around the 2.10 *qian* mark.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Market is Sluggish and Prices are Falling</h3>
<p>Piece goods transactions have been very quiet recently. The market is only experiencing sporadic activity, and prices are falling across the board. Yesterday, fine cloth from this factory fell another 0.05 *yuan*. Brands like Blue God, English Globe, and Peacock have all fallen to 7.50 *qian*. Fine twill is also soft, with Golden City at 7.75 *qian* and Blue God English at 7.50 *qian*. Only 16-pound Five Crane coarse cloth remains firm, still selling at 8.10 *qian*. The rest are weak. Brands like Hongfu and Samsung must be sold at two or three *qian* less. Blue striped bleached cloth is still active, with Ewo Five Blessings at 8.50 *qian*, Tatung Fortune God at 8.40 *qian*, and Dacheng Book at 8.25 *qian*. Blue striped satin fell by 0.025 *yuan* yesterday. Luen Cheong Seven Peonies sells for 1.825 *qian*. Shanghai goods are in short supply, and many wholesale shops are buying. Soft-gloss twill from Luen Cheong is still selling at 5.75 *qian*, and Shanghai factory goods at 5.50 *qian*. Due to unfavorable timing, activity is weaker than before. Sales of western goods have completely stopped. The route for *fu chou* (silk fabric) is still difficult to revive. Yesterday, Yuanfang Youhuayuan sold for 2.95 *qian*, and Xinyi Fenghuijihui for 3.5 *qian*. Sales of seven-silk raw *luo* and cooked *luo* are much lower than last year.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market is Flat and Unremarkable</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been extremely quiet recently, due to the adverse environment and tight credit. Market trends are consequently flat and unremarkable. Although tinplate, galvanized iron, black iron sheet, *lu pi* (road skin), triangular iron, and new lead wire are widely used, there is no possibility of upward momentum given the large inventory. As for lead, although recent transactions have been somewhat satisfactory, market prices fluctuate. Although the guild recently intervened to maintain prices, there are still hidden fluctuations of one or two *qian*. The highest estimated price is 13.85 *liang*, and the lowest is 13.65 *liang*. Sales to Ningbo and Shaoxing are more frequent, while other areas are simply asking. The price of small-headed nails with thin base vouchers is better, but actual transactions are limited, which is a pity.</p>

<h3>How Can Shanghai's Education Sector Contribute to National Salvation?</h3>
<p>—Observation</p>
<p>News from overseas reports that university presidents in America, to uphold humanitarianism and justice, initiated a boycott of Japanese goods involving hundreds of thousands of people. Also, Japanese primary and secondary school students are each donating one *jiao* to purchase patriotic airplanes. Upon hearing this, my heart pounded with emotion, and I wondered what to do. I believe many others share my feelings. Shanghai is now at peace, right? Schools have resumed, and the booming of cannons is no longer heard. It seems everyone feels that there is nothing much to worry about. However, let us reflect on the current state of our nation, to which our people have entrusted their lives. Our land is still being forcibly occupied. Thirty million compatriots in the North have been wailing under the iron hooves of the enemy for half a year. Five hundred to six hundred thousand people in the South are scattered and displaced, homeless for over two months. The blood of our compatriots brutally murdered by the enemy has stained the spring grass, yet it remains unwashed. The cries of those raped by the enemy echo to heaven, unanswered. Thriving markets have been reduced to rubble. The enemy's flag flutters in our territory. Although the sound of cannons is no longer heard, can we remain unmoved by everything we see and hear?</p>
<p>For a nation to survive permanently on this earth, it must carefully preserve and cultivate its national vitality, preventing it from withering and striving for its prosperity. Where does national vitality manifest itself? Certainly in the patriotic spirit of the nation. Illiterate people may not have a well-developed sense of patriotism because they have not received national education. We cannot blame them for this. However, if intellectuals in the education sector are also lifeless and indifferent to national affairs, then the source of national vitality will dry up, and that would be truly perilous!</p>
<p>There is a singing woman in the North named Li Xiangrong. Each time she takes the stage, before she strikes the drum, she delivers a brief speech urging people to love and save the country. Her audiences are deeply moved. It is regrettable that this precious vitality has emerged in this place. So, what about the educational institutions that nurture talent? Are the intellectuals in the education sector inferior to a singing woman?</p>
<p>I urge my colleagues in the education sector to rise quickly, unite swiftly, and devote our remaining time and energy to engaging in national salvation efforts. If we continue to only teach books and not teach people, if we only care about schools and not the nation, and if we ask nothing after class, then how will we ignite the new vitality of the nation? Look, foreigners have been sent to the schools of Liaoning province to be instructors. Textbooks compiled by foreigners have been forced on the students. These are the most poisonous ways to eradicate the national vitality! What do my colleagues in the education sector think about this? To save the country, we must act quickly. If we are late, even if we want to save the country, it may be too late.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Dust</h3>
<p>—Ya Luo</p>
<p>Ordinary people think dust is useless and harmless. Knowledgeable people think it is harmful. Who knows that scientists think it is very useful and beneficial to mankind? Its importance cannot be compared with air, but at least it can resist things that are secondary to air. True, dust is a parasite of microbes and a carrier of infectious diseases, but it is also the god of beauty and the creator of rain, fog, dew, and clouds.</p>
<p>The azure sky, the colorful and splendid sunset, and the green ocean are all so beautiful!</p>
<p>However, if there were no dust, where would we have such a sight? We must know that this is the gift of dust.</p>
<p>Take two round tubes, one filled with ordinary air and the other filled with pure, dust-free air. Then, shine a light into them, and we can see that the former tube is extremely bright, while the latter tube is as dark as lacquer and unrecognizable. At this time, if we slowly release the air from the former into the latter, then the latter tube will gradually emit a blue light. As the dust increases and the dust particles become coarser, it will turn pure white and colorless like ordinary air.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the different colors in the air are entirely due to the amount of dust in the air, the fineness of the dust particles. Less and finer dust means lighter colors, while more and coarser dust means deeper colors. The sky above is far from the ground, with less and finer dust, so it is naturally lovely green. The sunrise and sunset are red and yellow, bright and pleasing to the eye, because their light must pass through the low air near the horizon with more and coarser dust when reaching the human eye. However, if you go to a place higher than the sunset and look down, then the area around the sunset will also be blue or light yellow. So we can say that the different colors of the sunset are due to the amount of dust and the fineness of the dust particles, and also due to the different positions of the viewers.</p>
<p>The ocean is mostly deep blue because the ocean has a large amount of extremely fine dust particles and the skeletal remains of many extremely fine organic beings that died in the sea, volcanic ash erupted from volcanoes, mud ash flowing out of rivers, and meteor ash.</p>
<p>If dust only had this aesthetic effect, we would not have to promote it here and say how important it is, because it also has an effect that we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Take two glass tubes, one with ordinary air that has not been filtered and one with air that has been filtered with cotton and is dust-free. Then, pour water vapor into the tubes. The former tube will be filled with cloud-like condensed vapor, while the latter tube will remain transparent. This shows that when water vapor cools in air with dust, it will condense into clouds, dew, or rain; otherwise, it will not condense and will remain transparent (the density of the clouds is directly proportional to the number of dust particles). When the air is filled with water vapor due to sunlight evaporating seawater or other ground water, if there is not a little dust to condense it, it can only gather on the tops of mountains or on the leaves of trees in forests. This process becomes rapid, and when a lot of water vapor accumulates, then it can only turn into a torrential downpour, resulting in harm to people and things. On the one hand, because the vapor accumulates in high places, the land in slightly lower places becomes extremely dry and cannot be cultivated. This is the harm of not having dust in the air.</p>
<p>However, too much dust is also not what we want, because with more dust, there will be more clouds and fog. With more clouds and fog, all living things will receive less sunlight. With less sunlight, the productivity of the soil and plants will decrease. In the past one or two hundred years, London's industry has developed, factories have sprung up, dust has increased, and clouds and fog have also increased, so the productivity of agricultural affairs has greatly decreased.</p>

<h3>Hometown</h3>
<p>—Zhang Ren</p>
<p>I haven’t been home for a long time. Thinking of the words of the German poet Storm, the thought of homesickness becomes especially urgent. Therefore, on April 2, I borrowed the beautiful name of sweeping tombs and boarded a ship to return to my hometown.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, I arrived in E. My hometown was unharmed, and the rivers and mountains seemed to greet me with smiles. Under the iron hooves of the enemy cavalry, I dare not believe that I would be able to keep this piece of clean earth in the future!</p>
<p>At home, several days passed plainly but quietly.</p>
<p>On the tenth day, because of some things, I thought of going to W. It takes two to three hours to travel from E to W by small boat. Because I boarded the ship early, I leaned on the window to look at the scenery of green mountains and green waters. Soon, several passengers came one after another. Among them, a young man sat opposite me and read the newspaper to pass the time. When I was feeling infinite emotion towards two warships as thin as consumptive ghosts, a young man in a suit walked in from outside, wearing a badge on his clothes. After sitting next to the young man, he tapped the table and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>[Hey! Make tea!]</p>
<p>The waiter quickly put on a smiling face to make tea for him and diligently wrung a towel.</p>
<p>The boat sailed, and the purser came to sell tickets. When he reached the young man in a suit, he raised his head and looked at the purser, saying:</p>
<p>[Official errand, why buy a ticket?]</p>
<p>The purser replied with experience:</p>
<p>[Buy a half-price ticket, sir!]</p>
<p>The young man in the suit seemed a little angry, stood up, and said in a harsh voice:</p>
<p>[What? What if I don't buy it? When we get to W, you come to the ministry with me.]</p>
<p>The purser was very alert, fearing that he had offended some important person, and quickly said:</p>
<p>[It's easy to say, you don't have to buy it, you don't have to buy it,] and then he left.</p>
<p>The air in the cabin did not seem as calm as usual. The young man in the suit walked back and forth, humming popular tunes in his mouth. Everyone seemed a little annoyed, but dared to be angry and dared not speak.</p>
<p>After a while, he asked the young man reading the newspaper to borrow the newspaper. The young man lent it to him. After reading it, he felt a little tired and wanted to take a nap. Seeing that the young man had a package, he asked to borrow it as a pillow. The young man was already a little unwilling when borrowing the newspaper, and when he asked to borrow the package, he immediately refused, saying:</p>
<p>[Please borrow it from someone else.]</p>
<p>In the eyes of the young man in the suit, this seemed to be an unexpected thing. A person can ride a boat without buying a ticket, so he must be a special class of character. How could the words of a special class of people be resisted! He jumped up again and said:</p>
<p>[Don't lend it? Good! It is obvious that there are contraband items inside. Open it for inspection!]</p>
<p>The young man's emotions were already too angry to be suppressed, and he also stood up and said:</p>
<p>[Don't get me wrong. Do you think that just because you work in an institution, you can take advantage of your power and bully the people? When the country is in trouble, we should unite and resist foreign aggression, but you still want to rely on your power to exploit the people. Where is your conscience? Besides, what power and what reason do you have to inspect me?]</p>
<p>These were exactly the words we all wanted to say, and we all said in unison:</p>
<p>[That's right!]</p>
<p>The young man in the suit was hit hard, and because the crowd was too angry to be offended, he shouted:</p>
<p>[Okay, okay! When we get to W, I will have the police arrest you.] As he spoke, he walked out.</p>
<p>At this time, the sky was dim, and fine rain was falling continuously. The sound of the ship's engine was also playing an unusual tune.</p>
<p>W was not far away.</p>
