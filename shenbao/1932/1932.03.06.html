<p>黃渡嘉定太倉一帶</p>
<p>三四兩日全線激戰</p>
<p>均經我軍奮力擊退</p>
<p>婁塘戰事昨尙未停</p>
<p>我軍自二日、將淞滬第一道防綫撤退後、遂將全師退守黃渡嘉定太倉一帶第二道防綫、日軍亦由眞茹大埸瀏河三路前進、三四兩日、全綫均有戰事、尤以四日下午爲最激烈、我軍全綫應戰、四日晚間、已將全綫日軍擊退、茲將本報調查所得之戰况及陣地分紀如下、</p>
<p>敵攻黃渡經擊退四日下午三時許、日軍在南翔方面、用大砲多門、向我黃渡陣地猛力攻擊、同時並派大批飛機在黃渡空中、投擲炸彈、並以機槍射擊、隨後即有大隊步兵前進、另有騎兵千餘名向我軍陣地衝鋒’我軍竭力抵抗’激戰數小時’始終不能奪進我軍陣地’戰至五日上午一時許、敵始不支、紛紛向南翔退却、此役敵軍死傷甚重、我方亦有損失、</p>
<p>婁塘方面之激戰四日下午三時餘、敵軍爲策應南翔方面進攻起見、派大隊步兵、由羅店·唐家港婁塘一帶渡河、向我嘉定太倉全綫進攻、我軍憑河抵抗、激戰至深夜、全部被我擊退、現敵軍在河東、我軍在河西、雙方隔河作戰、故該處戰事、自四日下午起、至五日上午止、迄未停止、</p>
<p>白茆口敵軍已擊退瀏河西北面之白茆口、有敵艦數艘、並有步兵兩千餘名、四日在該處偷渡登岸、當被我駐軍擊退、</p>
<p>六河鎮日兵登陸昨日下午、據無線電報告稱、離瀏河西北約二十啓羅米突之六河鎮、昨日（五日）有日兵三千名登岸、我軍正在痛擊中、</p>
<p>三夾水到有日艦吳淞口外三夾水昨日有日軍運輸艦八艘、載運日軍第十四師圑全部預備擇地登岸、</p>
<p>日軍圖襲楊子角據報告昨有敵艦數艘載運第十四師圑之步兵騎兵及坦克車隊、預備在浦東奉賢縣境之楊子角登岸、冀圖襲我南匯奉賢等縣、我軍已嚴加防範、</p>
<p>十九路軍繼續抵抗大美晚報云、據十九路軍司令部參謀長黃鞏今晨（五日）語大美晚報代表、謂十九路軍已於星期四日奉總指揮蔣光鼐之命停戰、今預備繼續抵抗日軍、因日軍已進至距公共租界二十基羅米突之外也、十九路軍與第五路軍得近由寗浙開抵援軍之助、現在黃渡嘉定太倉瀏河設鞏固之防線、日軍今越出二十基羅米突之外、由南翔前進、與華軍在黃渡對峙、華軍將繼續猛抗之、惟華軍當局現是否計謀反攻、以圖克復失士、黃將軍不肯宣露僅謂十九路軍純爲自衛計’繼續抗拒日軍之侵略、軍事計畫、今尙未便宣布云、</p>
<p>我兩軍充分合作五日上海路透社消息、江灣瀏河一帶戰事詳情、現已漸趨明瞭、外傅華軍總退却、係因第五軍防守瀏河不力、茲據負責方面談、此說完全不確、第五軍之第八十七·及八十八·兩師、自參加戰綫以來、堅勇應戰、日方雖以飛機大砲猛轟、毫不畏怯、且當總退却時、防守瀏河戰綫者、係第七十八師之某部份軍隊云、十九路軍之負責長官亟欲外間明瞭經過情形、蓋外傅第五軍及十九路軍未能充分合作一說、殊非眞相云、</p>
<p>我軍報告勝利路透社四日南京電云、此間司令部接前敵長途無線電話據稱、上官雲相所統之第四十七師、於今日午後、向日軍第十一師進攻、頗獲勝利、</p>
<p>日軍圖佔黃渡大美晚報云、今晨（五日）白川司令部解釋日軍在二十基羅米突外作戰之理由、謂此擧有軍事上之必要、因日軍現受華軍轟擊故也、白川司令謂非佔黃渡、不足保護南翔、南翔爲植田司令部所在處、距黃渡八基羅米突、加以日軍偵察飛機昨晨曾爲華軍射擊、日馬隊亦受華兵來福槍轟擊、日飛機曾見華軍正在從事掘壕、日軍决計自黃渡起、佈哨兵線、直達瀏河附近之某村、以爲屏障、故日軍乃派支隊於昨日午後進抵黃渡、未與華兵開槍云、今晨九時據</p>
<p>白川司令部聲稱、未接黃渡區開火消息、日方發言人現信該處不致有戰事、</p>
<p>嘉定已有戰事大陆報云、昨日（四日）本埠所得戰事消息、多難徵實、據中國方面報告、則嘉定仍有戰事、日軍雖因中國軍隊之自動撤退、不戰而抵嘉定、仍未肯停兵、更圖深入、但與華兵交綏之後、即停止前進、植田中將曾赴南翔與小野及紐本兩少將相晤、商定今後行動、但昨日午後未有進迫中國軍隊之舉動、據稱、昨日早晨有日兵一隊在老瀏河鎮上陸、嗣又有一師圑由運艦八艘載往瀏河上岸、瀏河距上海六十五公里、已三倍於日軍所稱前進限度之二十公里、此時吳淞南翔間已有日軍六萬人、現信日人欲迫中國軍隊完全退至蘇州以外、但自瀏河至蘇州一帶、河渠縱橫、易守難攻、日人目前兵力、將見其難於擴張陣綫至瀏河以外也、惟日人欲延長上海戰局、更有一端、可爲明證、據聞日軍已敷設軍用海底電綫、由上海至吳淞、更自吳淞至日本、目下業經通報、又聞日軍已在浦東登岸、正向杭州方面前進、但日人否認此說、至南市及龍華一帶、則昨日尙未有日兵前往、蓋日兵在滬西現尙未過法租界西端以南、昨日下午有日兵四車經過公共租界、開往豊田紗廠、與同文書院、聞經過英兵防區、爲英兵所阻、迨出示通行證、乃准通過、此外日兵則循中山路西行、又沿蘇州河一帶英美防兵對過舊時華軍防綫、昨日已由日兵佈防、</p>

<p>日軍攻黃渡浮橋均擊退</p>
<p>十九路軍後方辦事處昨接五日蔣光鼐總指揮來電云、敵四日下午三時、由翔向我黃渡陣地砲擊、約三千餘發、同時飛機十餘架助戰、繼命步兵來衝、至深夜不得逞、現已退却、死傷極衆、蔣光鼐、</p>
<p>蔣總指揮電云、日方極力宣傳停戰、但昨日午後四時起至深夜、又向嘉定太倉之綫猛攻、崑山亦有下彈、</p>
<p>日飛機多架到崑山蘇州一帶偵察、並用機關槍掃射、居民死傷不少、</p>
<p>南翔有日兵千餘、大砲六門、現正從事構築防禦工事、</p>
<p>趙參謀長電云、浮橋鎭楊林渡之敵、被</p>
<p>擊敗、向瀏河方面退去、現仍在追擊中、</p>

<p>日兵陸續登岸日本在軍事上依然進行不輟、昨日上下午、仍有日本援軍用運輪船長崎丸等、裝來兩批、共有三千餘名、統在浦江匯山碼頭上陸、同時又有運送艦一艘、從日本满裝軍械軍食等到上海、下午復有大連來之奉天丸一艘、亦裝到軍火一批、統在起卸中、</p>
<p>大美晚報云、日軍第十四師圑已全部登陸、除在瀏河張華浜及上海方面楊子江各地點登陸者外、另有一部在浦東方面楊子角附近登陸、内有坦克車與馬隊、字林報云、昨晨復有大隊日軍分乘運艦六艘、在瀏河附近登岸、同時另有二千餘人、則由楊子江口外海軍艦隊載至蕰藻浜上陸、惟防守海濱一帶之海軍陸戰隊、則以吳淞已無華兵、業於昨夜回艦、至在瀏河登岸陸軍、料至少有數旅、共約八千人之衆、現向嘉定方面進發、</p>
<p>日又運到飛機大美晚報云、昨日日軍又有長崎運到陸軍飛機六架、在匯山碼頭卸下、送往楊樹浦飛機塲裝配、</p>
<p>眞如日軍西進大陸報云、據無線電管理局派往眞茹國際電台探視人員返報、日軍已於昨日（四日）午後一時三十分完全離開電台、向西北方前進、　　日軍偵諜報告字林報云、據日軍報告、中國軍隊現循京滬路黃渡站西首小河佈置防線、其壕溝及機關槍陣地、南至朱家鎭、北至九家宅、又南自靑浦縣、至黃渡後方之安亭一帶、亦有重兵扼守、蔡廷楷軍長司令部設在崑山、第二道防線則置在陸家浜車站一帶、極爲堅固、昨晨日軍哨兵曾往黃渡等處偵諜全線一周、軍隊則不圖前進、</p>
<p>山本野心流露大陸報云、星期四日軍陣亡聯隊長林大佐在虹口擧行喪禮時、有山本大尉演說稱、林大佐之葬身戰塲、樹立日本在揚子流域擴張勢力之基礎、他日達到目的之日、希望國人（日人）記憶林大佐並非虚死云云、此語足以徵實日人欲擴張勢力至全部揚子流域之野心、</p>

        <h1>1932.03.06</h1>
<h3 id="e1">New Resolutions of the League of Nations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>After handling the dispute between China and Japan, the League of Nations had established three resolutions. The first was the Geneva Resolution of September 30, 1931, the second was the Geneva Resolution of October 24, and the third was the Paris Resolution of December 10. The League itself took no action on the first resolution, nor did it put forward any concrete suggestions, so it is not worth discussing. The second resolution clearly stipulated the final deadline for the Japanese withdrawal, but was "tabled" (Briand's words) due to Japan's opposition vote. The third resolution's six articles were the only achievements of the League's months of hard work, but although it was full of shortcomings and also empty of content, the result was that even this empty resolution became ineffective. The Shanghai incident intensified the situation in the Far East. A major war has been raging for a month, and the League of Nations now has this fourth Geneva resolution. The past three resolutions have already exposed the League's lack of capacity, and this resolution more clearly shows its lack of sincerity in resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>If we try to examine the content of the League's three resolutions this time, we can know that first, the League has misjudged the nature of the Shanghai incident, that is, forgetting that the Japanese army was defending itself by attacking China. Second, the League only hopes for peace and asks for peace, but forgets to identify who is the culprit for destroying peace, especially blurring the line between peace that conforms to justice and peace that goes against justice. Peace should be strived for according to justice, and should never be willing to sacrifice anything in order to achieve peace and sacrifice justice for peace. Third, the League has no determination to sanction violence. Article 16 of the Covenant clearly stipulates economic sanctions, but the League has regarded it as a dead letter and has never dared to adopt it. Fourth, the League itself has no ability to resolve disputes, and it does not dare to stand on the side of facts and resolutely take responsibility, but shirks responsibility to neutral countries to mediate. Fifth, the League actually trusts the Japanese spokesman's claim that military operations have ceased, and ignores that the Japanese army is still continuing to attack. We have already heard the League's four resolutions and cannot help but feel disappointed and pessimistic. We believe that the League has never had the ability or sincerity to resolve disputes from beginning to end. The expansion of the Northeast incident and the outbreak of the Shanghai incident can almost be said to be half due to the Japanese aggressors, half due to our government's absolute trust in the League of Nations, failure to seek self-help, and the League's indecisiveness, cowardice, and neglect of its responsibilities.</p>
<p>From this we can know that the last efforts that our people and the world have hoped for from the League of Nations in the past six months are now almost hopeless. In order to maintain the survival of our nation and strive for justice and righteousness, the only way left is to rely on self-reliance, self-help, and self-salvation. The German saying "Only seek self-help and do not receive pity from others" is indeed the secret to our self-salvation today.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Army Attacks the Second Line of Defense of Our Army <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Areas of Huangdu, Jiading and Taicang</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting on the Entire Line on the 3rd and 4th</p>
<p>All Fiercely Repelled by Our Army</p>
<p>The Battle of Loutang Has Not Stopped Yet Yesterday</p>
<p>After our army retreated from the first line of defense in Songhu on the 2nd, the entire army retreated to the second line of defense in the areas of Huangdu, Jiading and Taicang. The Japanese army also advanced from the three routes of Zhenru, Dachang and Liuhe. There were battles on the entire line on the 3rd and 4th, especially the most fierce on the afternoon of the 4th. Our army responded to the entire line. On the evening of the 4th, the entire line of the Japanese army had been repelled. The battle situation and positions obtained by this newspaper's investigation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Attacks Huangdu and is Repelled. At about 3:00 pm on the 4th, the Japanese army used many cannons from the Nanxiang area to fiercely attack our Huangdu position. At the same time, a large number of planes were dispatched to drop bombs in the air above Huangdu and strafe with machine guns. Then a large number of infantry advanced, and more than a thousand cavalrymen charged our army's position. Our army resisted with all its strength. After several hours of fierce fighting, it was still unable to capture our army's position. The enemy began to collapse at about 1:00 am on the 5th, and retreated to Nanxiang. The enemy army suffered heavy casualties in this battle, and our side also suffered losses.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle in the Loutang Area. At about 3:00 pm on the 4th, in order to coordinate the attack in the Nanxiang area, the enemy army dispatched a large number of infantry to cross the river from the areas of Luodian, Tangjiagang and Loutang to attack our entire line of Jiading and Taicang. Our army resisted by the river. After fierce fighting until late at night, all were repelled by us. Currently, the enemy army is on the east side of the river, and our army is on the west side of the river. The two sides are fighting across the river, so the battle there has not stopped from the afternoon of the 4th to the morning of the 5th.</p>
<p>The Enemy Army at Baimaokou Has Been Repelled. At Baimaokou, northwest of Liuhe, there were several enemy ships and more than 2,000 infantrymen. They attempted to land secretly there on the 4th, but were repelled by our garrison.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Land at Liuhezhen. Yesterday afternoon, according to a radio report, 3,000 Japanese soldiers landed at Liuhezhen, about 20 kilometers northwest of Liuhe, yesterday (the 5th). Our army is fiercely attacking them.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Arrive at Sanjiashui. Yesterday, eight Japanese transport ships carrying the entire 14th Division of the Japanese army arrived at Sanjiashui outside Wusongkou, preparing to choose a place to land.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Plans to Attack Yangzijiao. According to reports, several enemy ships carrying infantry, cavalry and tank detachments of the 14th Division are preparing to land at Yangzijiao in the Fengxian County area of ​​Pudong, hoping to attack our Nanhui, Fengxian and other counties. Our army has strengthened its defenses.</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army Continues to Resist. The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that Huang Gong, the chief of staff of the 19th Route Army Headquarters, told the representatives of the "Shanghai Evening Post" this morning (the 5th) that the 19th Route Army had received the order from Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai on Thursday the 4th to cease fire and is now preparing to continue resisting the Japanese army because the Japanese army has advanced to 20 kilometers outside the public concession. The 19th Route Army and the 5th Route Army have received assistance from reinforcements arriving from Ningzhe and have now established a strong defense line in Huangdu, Jiading, Taicang and Liuhe. The Japanese army has now crossed 20 kilometers and is advancing from Nanxiang, confronting the Chinese army in Huangdu. The Chinese army will continue to resist fiercely. However, General Huang was unwilling to reveal whether the Chinese army authorities are currently planning a counterattack in an attempt to recover lost territory, only saying that the 19th Route Army is purely for self-defense and continues to resist the Japanese army's invasion. Military plans are not convenient to announce at this time.</p>
<p>Our Two Armies Fully Cooperate. A Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 5th reported that the details of the battle in the Jiangwan and Liuhe areas are now becoming clearer. The rumor that the total retreat of the Chinese army was due to the poor defense of Liuhe by the 5th Army is completely untrue, according to responsible sources. The 87th and 88th divisions of the 5th Army have fought bravely since joining the battle line. Even though the Japanese side bombarded fiercely with planes and cannons, they were not afraid at all. Moreover, when the total retreat occurred, the defenders of the Liuhe battle line were a part of the 78th Division. Responsible officers of the 19th Route Army are eager for the outside world to understand the situation, because the rumor that the 5th Army and the 19th Route Army failed to fully cooperate is not true at all.</p>
<p>Our Army Reports Victory. A Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 4th reported that the headquarters here received a long-distance radio telephone call from the front saying that the 47th Division under the command of Shangguan Yunxiang attacked the 11th Division of the Japanese army this afternoon and achieved considerable victory.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Plans to Occupy Huangdu. The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that this morning (the 5th), Commander Shirakawa's headquarters explained the reason for the Japanese army's fighting outside the 20-kilometer zone, saying that this move was necessary from a military point of view because the Japanese army is currently under bombardment from the Chinese army. Shirakawa said that Huangdu must be occupied to protect Nanxiang, where Ueda's headquarters is located, 8 kilometers from Huangdu. In addition, Japanese reconnaissance planes were shot at by the Chinese army yesterday morning, and Japanese cavalry teams were also bombarded by Chinese soldiers with rifles. Japanese planes saw the Chinese army digging trenches. The Japanese army decided to set up a sentry line from Huangdu to a certain village near Liuhe as a barrier. Therefore, the Japanese army dispatched a detachment to Huangdu yesterday afternoon, and did not open fire with the Chinese soldiers. According to Shirakawa's headquarters at 9:00 this morning, no news of firing in the Huangdu area has been received. The Japanese spokesman now believes that there will be no fighting there.</p>
<p>There is Fighting in Jiading. "Dalu News" reported that most of the war news obtained in this city yesterday (the 4th) is difficult to verify. According to Chinese reports, there is still fighting in Jiading. Although the Japanese army arrived in Jiading without a fight due to the automatic withdrawal of the Chinese army, they were still unwilling to stop and planned to go deeper. However, after a clash with Chinese soldiers, they stopped advancing. Lieutenant General Ueda visited Nanxiang and met with Major Generals Ono and Niube to discuss future actions, but there was no movement to press on the Chinese army yesterday afternoon. It is said that a team of Japanese soldiers landed on the Old Liuhe Town yesterday morning, and then a division group was carried by eight transport ships to land on Liuhe. Liuhe is 65 kilometers from Shanghai, which is three times the 20 kilometers of the Japanese army's so-called advance limit. At this time, there were 60,000 Japanese troops between Wusong and Nanxiang. It is now believed that the Japanese want to force the Chinese army to completely retreat beyond Suzhou, but from Liuhe to Suzhou, there are crisscrossing rivers and canals, which are easy to defend and difficult to attack. The Japanese current strength will find it difficult to expand the front line beyond Liuhe. However, the Japanese intention to prolong the Shanghai war situation has another aspect, which can be evidenced. It is reported that the Japanese army has laid a military submarine cable from Shanghai to Wusong, and from Wusong to Japan. It is now reported that it has been opened. It is also heard that the Japanese army has landed in Pudong and is advancing towards Hangzhou. However, the Japanese deny this. As for the Nanshi and Longhua areas, no Japanese soldiers went there yesterday. The Japanese soldiers in Huxi have not yet crossed south of the western end of the French concession. Yesterday afternoon, four cars of Japanese soldiers passed through the public concession and drove to the Toyota Yarn Factory and Tongwen College. It is said that they were blocked by British soldiers when passing through the British defense area, but were allowed to pass after showing their passes. In addition, the Japanese soldiers went west along Zhongshan Road and deployed defenses along the Suzhou River along the old Chinese army defense line guarded by British and American soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e3">War Report Released by Military Headquarters <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Army Attacks Huangdu Floating Bridge and is Repelled</p>
<p>The Rear Office of the 19th Route Army received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai on the 5th, which read: The enemy bombarded our Huangdu position from Xiang at 3:00 pm on the 4th, about 3,000 rounds, and more than a dozen planes assisted in the battle. Then infantry was ordered to charge, but failed until late at night. They have now retreated and suffered heavy casualties. Jiang Guangnai.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Jiang telegraphed that the Japanese side is trying its best to promote the ceasefire, but from 4:00 pm to late at night yesterday, it launched a fierce attack on the Jiading and Taicang lines, and Kunshan was also bombed.</p>
<p>Many Japanese planes arrived in the Kunshan and Suzhou areas to侦察, and strafed with machine guns, killing and injuring many residents.</p>
<p>There are more than a thousand Japanese soldiers and six cannons in Nanxiang, and they are currently engaged in building defensive works.</p>
<p>Chief of Staff Zhao telegraphed that the enemy at Yanglindu, Fubridge Town, was defeated and retreated towards Liuhe, and is still being pursued.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Army Expands War Zone <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Reinforcements Arrive in Song Yesterday, a friend from Wusong to Shanghai said that at about 8:00 am yesterday morning (the 5th), two Japanese destroyers, Nian Jiu San Shi Liang Hao, carrying reinforcements arrived in Wusong, entered the port and sailed directly to Zhanghuabang Grain and Rice Wharf to anchor. Before the arrival of the two ships, there was already one ship there. Now there are three ships in total. Most of the other Japanese ships are anchored outside the Sanjiashui estuary. It was found that the two ships were carrying military grain, military treasures and various military supplies, which were quite heavy. The number of Japanese marines was about 2,000. After anchoring, they moved the applied items to the railway factory for storage. The area from Zhanghuabang to the Wenzaobang and the area north of the outer road to the fort area are all guarded by Japanese sentries.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Land One After Another. Japan is still conducting military operations unremittingly. Yesterday morning and afternoon, there were still two batches of Japanese reinforcements brought in by Japanese transport ships, Nagasaki Maru, etc., totaling more than 3,000 people, all landing at the Huishan Wharf in Pudong. At the same time, there was another transport ship that came to Shanghai from Japan fully loaded with military equipment and food. In the afternoon, the Fengtian Maru from Dalian also arrived with a batch of military supplies, all of which are being unloaded.</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the entire 14th Division of the Japanese army has landed. In addition to those who landed at Liuhe, Zhanghuabang and various locations along the Yangtze River in Shanghai, another part landed near Yangzijiao in Pudong, including tank detachments and cavalry teams. The "China Press" reported that a large number of Japanese troops took six transport ships and landed near Liuhe again yesterday morning. At the same time, another 2,000 people were carried by the naval fleet from outside the mouth of the Yangtze River to land at Wenzaobang. However, the marine corps guarding the coastal area returned to the ship last night because there were no Chinese soldiers in Wusong. As for the army that landed in Liuhe, it is estimated that there are at least several brigades, totaling about 8,000 people, and they are now advancing towards Jiading.</p>
<p>Japan Also Transports Planes. The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that yesterday, the Japanese army transported six army planes from Nagasaki, which were unloaded at Huishan Wharf and sent to the Yangshupu airfield for assembly.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Zhenru Moves West. "Dalu News" reported that according to the return report of personnel sent by the Radio Management Bureau to the Zhenru International Radio Station to investigate, the Japanese army completely left the radio station at 1:30 pm yesterday (the 4th) and moved northwest.</p>
<p>Japanese Reconnaissance Reports. The "China Press" reported that, according to Japanese reports, the Chinese army is now deploying a defense line along the small river west of the Huangdu Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Road. Its trenches and machine gun positions extend south to Zhujia Town and north to Jiujiazhai. In addition, there are also heavy troops guarding the area from Qingpu County to Anting behind Huangdu. Commander Cai Tingkai's headquarters is located in Kunshan, and the second line of defense is located near the Lujiabang Station, which is extremely strong. Yesterday morning, Japanese sentries侦察ed the entire line around Huangdu and other places, but the army did not plan to advance.</p>
<p>Yamamoto's Ambitions Revealed. "Dalu News" reported that when the Japanese army held a funeral for Colonel Hayashi, the commander of the regiment who died in battle on Thursday, Captain Yamamoto said in a speech that Colonel Hayashi's burial in the battlefield laid the foundation for Japan's expansion of power in the Yangtze River basin. He hoped that the people of the country (Japanese) would remember that Colonel Hayashi did not die in vain on the day when the goal was achieved. This statement is enough to prove the Japanese ambition to expand their power to the entire Yangtze River basin.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Diplomatic Policy Confirmed <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Guo Taiqi Visits British, American and French Ministers Separately. Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi stated that the four ceasefire conditions proposed by Japan are too far from the five points of the ceasefire foundation established on the British warship Gant. He has telegraphed to Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan in Luoyang, and Luo Wengan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, suggesting that it is impossible to accept such humiliating conditions. President Wang and Foreign Minister Luo have both replied to Shanghai, expressing their unanimous agreement. Therefore, our diplomatic policy has been confirmed. Vice Minister Guo then visited British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, and French Minister Wild separately yesterday to explain the details. The three ministers expressed their understanding and telegraphed their respective governments to report.</p>
<p>Yan Huqing's Letter to Peng Gu. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a letter from Geneva Representative Yan Huqing to Peng Gu, Chairman of the League of Nations Council, stating our country's position. The details are disclosed as follows: (Omitted salutations) My government has accepted your chairman's ceasefire proposal of February 29, which has been forwarded to the Council. This proposal was the result of the exchange of views between the Chinese and Japanese representatives and the British Navy Admiral on the British flagship Gant on February 28, which was based on the principle of simultaneous withdrawal of troops by China and Japan. The British representative also reported to the Council on February 29. The Chinese and Japanese representatives requested their respective governments to consider it accordingly. The Japanese government has not yet replied, but has sent a large number of reinforcements to continue landing in the public concession and carry out a major offensive. Its actions are obviously contrary to the Japanese government's note to the Council on February 29 accepting the ceasefire proposal, which raises doubts about the sincerity of the Japanese government. If your chairman's ceasefire proposal can be put into practice, my government can accept it at any time. My government is also prepared to participate in the round table conference proposed by your chairman to be held in Shanghai and recognizes that the safety of the public concession is related to the maintenance of peace in Shanghai and its vicinity. However, this round table conference should be limited to discussing the issue of restoring the ceasefire in Shanghai. As for all Sino-Japanese disputes, they must still be resolved by China using the procedures of the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi's Talk. Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi gave a talk to reporters yesterday, saying that the Shanghai case and the Northeast Three Provinces issue are closely related. Therefore, our country, in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, requires the convening of a special session of the League of Nations to find a way to resolve the entire issue of Japan's use of force to invade our country. Now the Japanese side has proposed so-called four basic conditions for a ceasefire, which completely overturns the five principles agreed upon by the representatives of both China and Japan on the British warship on the 28th of last month, and at the same time, it is tantamount to overturning the proposal of Mr. Peng Gu, the Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations. This is because Mr. Peng Gu's proposal is based on the five principles proposed by the British warship on the 28th of last month. I have explained the attitude of our government to the ministers of various friendly countries yesterday and rejected the four basic conditions for a ceasefire proposed by the Japanese side. The Japanese side must fulfill the withdrawal of troops from both sides before there is room for negotiation, and declared that our country has no intention of changing the status quo of the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession by force, and has always made every effort to protect the lives and property of foreign nationals in Shanghai. This can be proved by the actions of our army towards foreign nationals and the Public Concession and the French Concession in this war. If the so-called round table conference is convened for security reasons, then there is no need to convene such a conference. The ministers of various friendly countries expressed their satisfaction with my explanation and promised to convey my words to the governments of their respective countries. As for the fact that our country will never participate in any round table conference before the Japanese army withdraws from our territory, and even if there is a possibility of convening such a conference in the future, our country must carefully consider the agenda of the conference in advance, and it must not involve issues such as the expansion of the concession and our country's stationing of troops in the Shanghai area, otherwise there is no room for participation.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Gu Weijun's Talk <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Round Table Conference Cannot be Established</p>
<p>The reporter visited Mr. Gu Weijun at his residence yesterday and asked whether the outside world's rumor that the Chinese government had specially appointed Mr. Gu as a representative to attend the Shanghai Round Table Conference was true. According to Mr. Gu's reply, the Chinese side advocates that the Japanese army should not only withdraw from Dachang, Zhenru and other places, but also withdraw from Zhabei, Wusong and other places into the concession in accordance with the original agreement, so as to gradually board ships and return to Japan. As for the round table conference, it is the Japanese side's proposal, and the Chinese side has never agreed to it. Moreover, what issues will the so-called round table conference discuss has not been explained. Since the nature of the conference is not clear, it is even more difficult for China to agree. Therefore, the issue of a representative attending is even more out of the question in the first place. If there is a need to discuss the Shanghai issue, it should be discussed and resolved together with the Northeast Three Provinces issue.</p>

<p>Jiangsu National Crisis Association Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association Telegram to Jiang He et al.: Nanjing Jiang Jieshi and He Jingzhi, esteemed sirs: The bitter fighting in Songhu has lasted for two months and two days. Various groups are sending telegrams requesting reinforcements in an endless stream. However, apart from Zhang Zhizhong's unit, we have heard of no other significant forces being dispatched. We are passively watching the enemy increase daily, and our army is trapped in a desperate situation, forcing it to abandon its positions. The public is filled with grief and indignation, blaming the government for missing opportunities and failing to live up to the expectations of our people. Recently, enemy troops have already attacked Jiading, Taicang, and Kunshan counties, but the reinforcements sent by the government consist of only Shangguan Yunxiang's one division, which is insufficient to defeat the enemy. If the Southeast falls entirely into enemy hands, how can the government remain complacent? We urge the swift dispatch of a large army to retake Songhu within a specified time and eliminate the enemy troops, thereby dispelling public doubts and atoning for past failures. Ma Liang and others of the Jiangsu Provincial National Crisis Relief Association kowtow, song.</p>
<p>National Salvation Joint Association Shanghai Various Groups National Salvation Joint Association Interrogates the Government in a Telegram: (Titles omitted) While the battle in Shanghai is raging, and our army is winning, the enemy is launching large-scale reinforcements, attacking our flanks. You sit idly by without providing support, causing our army to have no choice but to execute a 'strategic retreat.' Public sentiment is furious, and we can no longer excuse you. However, today's newspapers carry a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing, stating that the National Government has announced a battle report, claiming that the government has dispatched reinforcements, even stating that Feng's 20,000 troops have already reached Taicang. We note that Taicang is just a stone's throw from Shanghai. Why didn't you send reinforcements when the 19th Route Army was fighting the enemy, but only after the retreat? If the Reuters dispatch is inaccurate, then your crime of fooling the people and harming the country is even more unforgivable.</p>
<p>Whampoa Military Academy Alumni National Salvation Association Whampoa Military Academy Alumni Anti-Japanese National Salvation Group Telegram to the Second Central Committee: Luoyang Second Central Committee, esteemed sirs: Japanese aggression intensifies daily. The Eastern Provinces were lost before, and now Songhu is being abandoned. The entire nation is filled with grief and indignation. Yet, the central government authorities have still not implemented any concrete plans for resistance. The Shanghai Incident has been ongoing for over a month. The only troops engaged in the battle are five divisions. Although the enemy is separated by vast oceans, they have been able to increase their forces to over 100,000. Yet, despite the proximity of Nanjing and Shanghai, the authorities have not sent a single soldier as reinforcements. There is no greater misdeed than this, harming the country and its people. Your so-called determination to resist is merely deceiving yourselves. With the fall of Songhu, our gateway is wide open, and our great land will be lost to foreign races. If you do not wish to be abandoned by the people, we hope you will take action to redeem yourselves. This telegram is filled with grief and indignation, mingled with blood and tears.

<p>Two Business Groups Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and Shanghai Citizens' Association Re-telegram to the National Government in Luoyang: Most urgent, National Government of Luoyang, esteemed sirs: The soldiers of the 19th Army and the 5th Army, defending themselves and resisting the Japanese, have been forced to shift their defenses due to a lack of reinforcements. We implore the government to urge reinforcements to arrive quickly. If you disregard this and fail to provide assistance, harming the people and betraying the country, you will be abandoning yourselves to the masses. Please provide a clear reply as to whether reinforcements will be dispatched. Shanghai Citizens' Association and All Shanghai Business General Association kowtow together, zhi.</p>
<p>Paper Industry Association Paper Trade Association Telegram to the Authorities in Nanjing: Minister He of the Military Affairs Department in Nanjing, Commissioners Jiang, Feng, and Li of the Military Commission, Chairman Lin of Luoyang, and President Wang, esteemed sirs: Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, our 19th Route Army has been fighting fiercely for over a month, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's advance. The enemy's reinforcements have been arriving continuously, increasing to 100,000. Outnumbered and isolated, our army was forced to retreat from Songhu. Our compatriots are now in a state of immense suffering and pain. We earnestly implore the government to dispatch reinforcements with utmost speed to recover Songhu and save us from peril. We urgently submit this telegram, hoping that all the central figures will seriously consider it. Liu Minzhai, Chairman of the Shanghai Paper Trade Association, kowtows, Jiang.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Sundries Trade Association Cheng Yujie and others of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Sundries Trade Association Telegram to Nanjing and Luoyang: Minister He Jingzhi of the Military Affairs Department in Nanjing, and forwarding to Chairman Lin and President Wang in Luoyang, Commissioners Jiang, Feng, and Li of the Military Commission, esteemed sirs: The Japanese invasion of Shanghai has now lasted for over a month. Our compatriots are in a state of immense suffering and pain, and the business community is enduring endless hardship. We only pray that the strong enemy will be swiftly annihilated, allowing us to strike directly at the enemy's headquarters, avenge our nation, and protect our territory. Even at the cost of any great sacrifice, we would not hesitate. However, after fiercely defending Zhabei, it has now fallen. After vowing to protect Wusong, it has also been lost. The reason for this is that the front line consists of only the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, with only over 20,000 soldiers, who must defend a front line of over ten miles. With a small number of exhausted troops fighting against an enemy twice their size, the 19th Route Army has repeatedly risked their lives and persevered, but reinforcements have not arrived, resulting in a missed opportunity. The nation supports an army of 2 million, spending vast sums monthly, yet it is only used for internal conflicts and not to resist foreign aggression. How can you justify this to our compatriots? The people of Shanghai are now being bombed and shelled by the Japanese army, and are in dire straits. The 19th Route Army has been fighting for a month, running out of ammunition and supplies, and is also facing a critical life-or-death situation. You are passively watching the situation, disregarding the suffering of the people, and have consistently failed to provide adequate support, resulting in the loss of troops and territory. The public is filled with grief and indignation, crying out urgently. You have sworn to long-term resistance and comprehensive planning, yet now you are ignoring everything, and the loss of Songhu is the fault of the central government and the responsibility of you all. If you continue to engage in empty talk and withhold reinforcements, the foundation of the nation will be shaken and the hearts of the people will be difficult to win back. It is not too late to take action. We only hope that the government will swiftly dispatch reinforcements and replenish military supplies, so that the soldiers at the front can be motivated to advance bravely and recover the lost territory. All our compatriots must also unite as one, put on armor and take up arms, fulfilling their aspirations to kill the enemy and defend our land, and annihilate the Japanese invaders. As for surrendering to powerful forces, seeking temporary peace, or establishing so-called neutral zones or free cities, we dare to represent the Chinese and Foreign Sundries Trade Association of this city to vow that we will not recognize them. We urge you to carefully consider this matter and submit this telegram, earnestly requesting a reply.

<p>National Products Factories Association The National Products Factories Association telegraphed the National Government yesterday: Since the capital has been moved to Luoyang, the main focus is long-term resistance. The 19th Route Army has been fighting valiantly in Shanghai. The Japanese invaders have repeatedly increased their troops. Apart from Zhang Zhizhong's unit, the central government has not sent any reinforcements, leading to a disparity in numbers and a retreat. Who is to blame for this major mistake? After the Japanese advance, they have fundamentally overturned the basic conditions for a ceasefire. Their violent methods are even more severe than before. From now on, there is no other way but to continue resistance. We urge you to swiftly dispatch a large army to recover the lost territory and atone for your failures. Otherwise, you will be responsible for harming the country and its people. This telegram is filled with tears and incoherent words.</p>
<p>Postal Workers and Staff Associations The Postal Workers and Staff Associations Telegram to the Central Government: Luoyang Central Second Plenary Session, esteemed sirs: During this Japanese invasion of Shanghai, our army bravely resisted the enemy for a full month. The military prowess displayed has shaken the world. However, due to the failure to receive reinforcements, on the 2nd of this month, we retreated to the second line of defense. We implore the session to instruct the central government to deploy a large army as reinforcements and to order the military leaders in the north to immediately send troops out of Shanhaiguan to recover the lost territory by force and relieve the siege of Shanghai. We urgently submit this message, awaiting your instructions with utmost anticipation. Shanghai Postal Workers and Staff Association, Labor Union, kowtow together, wei.</p>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters Shanghai Municipal Party Asks Wang and Jiang to Supervise the Anti-Japanese War: Most urgent, to arrive immediately, Committee Member Wang Jingwei in Luoyang, Committee Member Jiang Jieshi in Nanjing, esteemed sirs: Since the Japanese invasion of Shenyang more than five months ago, the government has not recovered the lost territory, nor has it sent a single soldier. Since the invasion of Shanghai, it has been over a month, and the soldiers fighting a bloody battle at the front have finally been forced to retreat. The people of the entire nation are filled with grief and indignation. If diplomacy is indeed being pursued, the League of Nations remains weak. If military matters require overall planning, the national defense preparations are not yet solid. It is clear that the central government has announced to the nation its determination to resist aggression, move the capital, lead the people, and engage in long-term resistance, promising not to break its word. However, the current situation is that the enemy is becoming more deeply entrenched. The three aspects in which you two gentlemen must act decisively and without delay to resist the enemy and save the nation are: Personally leading a large army to supervise the counter-offensive and recover Songhu, containing Liaoning and Jilin, is the first aspect. Issuing strict orders to the generals and soldiers in the Northeast to leave Shanhaiguan within a specified time to recover the lost territory and atone for past mistakes is the second aspect. Assigning responsibility to the diplomatic authorities to recognize the Shanghai Incident and the Liaoning Incident as one, not to regard them as local problems, not to attempt local solutions, not to sign humiliating treaties that lose national sovereignty, and not to harbor any thoughts of seeking temporary peace or begging for mercy, but to uphold our legitimate claims and make the Japanese invaders bear all responsibility, is the third aspect. To summarize the above three points, decide in two words, so that the world will still have justice and the Japanese invaders will also know repentance, return our territory, and compensate for our losses, then it may not be inappropriate to talk about peace. Conversely, we abide by treaties, they destroy them, we respect mediators, they despise them, we keep our promises, they break them. If we still want to negotiate peace under these circumstances, is it not simply delaying the country's downfall? You two gentlemen are revolutionary pioneers, and you must have different views on this. Only by upholding the fearless spirit of the late Premier, personally leading the brave soldiers, and fighting the Japanese invaders to the death, if successful, we will become the Kemal of Turkey and the Foch of France. If unsuccessful, we will become the Wen Tianxiang of the Song Dynasty and the Shi Kefa of the Ming Dynasty. We, the people of the entire nation, vow to contribute our wealth and efforts and share life and death with you. Heaven sees as the people see, and heaven hears as the people hear. Those who obey Heaven prosper, and those who defy Heaven perish. We submit these words in tears, without taking the time to choose them carefully. We hope that you two gentlemen will seriously consider this. Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party kowtows, song, printed.</p>
<p>Joint Office of Fellow-Provincial Associations The Joint Office of Fellow-Provincial Associations in Shanghai yesterday issued an urgent notice to various fellow-provincial associations: The enemy's reinforcements are increasing daily, and they are dividing their forces to attack Liuhang, causing our patriotic 19th Route Army, defending the land, to have no choice but to retreat due to being outnumbered and isolated. The central government moved to Luoyang for the purpose of long-term resistance and declared that it would unite against aggression. Why is it passively watching the isolated army fight a bloody battle without providing assistance, abandoning the three million citizens of Shanghai as if they were worthless? We urge your association to quickly telegram Luoyang to dispatch troops as reinforcements and recover Songhu, so as to uphold public morale and promote national prestige. We earnestly hope for this.</p>

<p>Central Committee Members Stationed in Shanghai Central Committee Members Stationed in Shanghai Telegram to the Officers and Soldiers at the Front: Kunshan forwards to Commander-in-Chief Jiang, Army Commander Cai, Army Commander Zhang, Commander Dai, and all officers and soldiers, esteemed sirs: Since the Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai, you officers and soldiers have independently engaged the enemy in battle, repeatedly achieving meritorious service. Because the enemy could not achieve their aims of aggression, they have been continuously sending reinforcements, exceeding 100,000, and also deploying dozens of warships and hundreds of aircraft. Our side has only successively added the Fifth Army to the front lines, totaling less than 40,000. You have fought bloody hand-to-hand battles under the sound of cannons and bombs, accumulating fatigue without showing weariness, and even when wounded, you still think of fighting bravely. You have been able to defeat the many with the few, advancing without retreating. If the so-called long-term resistance is not merely empty talk, then there are still tens of thousands of crack troops that can be deployed nearby. It should not be difficult to annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop. Yet, those who spontaneously rush to provide assistance have no way to do so, and those who hear the news and volunteer for duty have no orders to await. Although it is said daily that reinforcements are on their way, it is no different from pouring water from the West River to save a fish trapped in a dry rut, causing the enemy to take advantage of the opportunity to land in Liuhang and attack our rear. Our army had no choice but to abandon its original positions and retreat to the second line of defense. The blame lies somewhere else, and the entire nation understands this. However, this month-long battle has been enough to suppress the enemy's arrogance, establish the model of soldiers, change the views of the world's powers, and uplift the spirit of the entire nation. It is admirable, praiseworthy, and moving to tears in a way that words cannot describe. Your telegrams express the determination to fight to the last bullet and the last soldier, and not to live under the same sky as the Japanese invaders, which fully demonstrates your steadfast will and unwavering integrity. Recently, we heard that in the battles of Nanxiang and Liuhang, you inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Recovering Songhu is just the beginning. We hope that the soldiers and civilians of the entire nation will follow in the footsteps of you officers and soldiers, sharing the same hatred for the enemy, not being swayed by personal feelings or interests, and working together to fight the Japanese invaders, repelling the vile enemy and securing our land. Those who die become martyrs, and those who survive achieve success. The actions of you officers and soldiers will be forever remembered. We send this telegram as a special message of condolence, hoping that you will understand.

This change in strategy, retreating to the second line of defense, will surely further boost our morale and inspire us to bravely kill the enemy.

<h3 id="e9">A Glimpse of the Situation in Zhabei <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Full of Naval Landing Forces</p>
<p>Few Pedestrians, Like a Dead City</p>
<p>Zhabei is the essence of our Chinese territory, with a population of hundreds of thousands. Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, it has been subjected to bombing by enemy artillery and aircraft, turning a prosperous city into a desolate mound. Further, with the help of Jiangbei traitors who assisted the enemy in setting fires, the bustling streets have become a field of rubble. The reporter, as one of the victims of this war, had his residence completely destroyed by artillery fire. Since the retreat of our army on March 1st, there has been no fighting in Zhabei. The transportation blockade, which lasted for five weeks, has also been partially lifted. Yesterday, the reporter wanted to go home to see if it had been completely burned. What he experienced along the way can truly be described as hell. The firsthand experience is recorded below in detail:</p>
<p>Obstacles on Baoshan Road Yesterday, the gates at the end of North Zhejiang Road and Nichengqiao in the concession area were opened, but with the stipulation that passage was allowed from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Outside these hours, pedestrians were not allowed to pass. Yesterday morning, the reporter went from the Nichengqiao gate to Zhabei. At the gate, the volunteer soldiers guarding it were extremely strict in their inspections. Not even a match was allowed to be brought in. When the reporter arrived in Zhabei, there were very few pedestrians on the road. There were many Japanese soldiers patrolling in cars. All along the way, there were ruined walls and debris, which was a sight that could not be described in words. When the reporter went to Baoshan Road, a large number of Japanese soldiers were stationed there. The reporter only reached the entrance of Shengshun Lane. When he tried to go further north, the Japanese army stopped him, saying that the fire to the north had not yet been extinguished, and the stench of the refugees who had been unable to escape and had been burned to death permeated the area, so they would not allow anyone to go forward. The reporter had no choice but to retreat.</p>
<p>Second Trip to Zhabei At 11:30 AM, the reporter again crossed the Suzhou River to the north of Xinzha Bridge and went to Zhabei for the second time. He saw that the north bank of the river was full of Japanese soldiers, mostly naval landing forces, who were using pliers to remove the power grid and ordering workers to throw the sandbags of our army into the Suzhou River. The reporter crossed dozens of trenches dug by our army along the river bank and entered Haichang Road. He saw that dead refugees had been coffined and were still abandoned on the roadside. The roads through the Gongyi vegetable market were almost deserted, as if entering a dead city. The sound of "呜呜" was all from the Japanese soldiers patrolling in cars. They were all wearing black uniforms and carrying guns and ammunition. The residents along the river were busy carrying their belongings, but those on the inner roads were not allowed to take anything, or they would be arrested.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection During the reporter's second trip to Zhabei, he saw only a few laborers and some people from Jiangbei on the road. During the two hours of travel, he did not see anyone wearing a long gown. Several people advised the reporter not to go any further, saying that the Japanese army was very jealous of Chinese people wearing long gowns. The reporter then changed to taking small roads, because there were large groups of Japanese soldiers everywhere on the main roads. Even in remote alleys, there were Japanese soldiers guarding them. When the reporter passed by, they shouted to stop him, searched him, and questioned him in Japanese. The reporter did not know Japanese and was almost arrested. Fortunately, he drew in the dirt that he was "going home to see the house," and another Japanese soldier released him.</p>
<p>Temporary Labor The reporter passed through Gonghexin Road, where there was a bomb crater and a road that had been filled with debris from demolished fortifications. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers, each with a bayonet, forced pedestrians to carry sandbags to fill the road. If they refused, they would be arrested. Their demeanor was fierce, which was heartbreaking. The reporter wanted to pass through here, but there was no other way. He had no choice but to endure the humiliation of being a temporary laborer and dragging sandbags. What crime had the common people committed to be driven by foreigners? We are all part of the same country and the same people. Why should we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, be subjected to such humiliation? Are the defenders of the nation truly only the 19th Route Army? Wild Dogs Eating Corpses The deaths of refugees in Zhabei during the artillery fire were truly countless. Corpses were abandoned in the wilderness to rot. White bones were in the fields, and no one buried them. The reporter went to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and saw that the engine room had been blown to pieces. On the vacant lot on the left, there was a child's body, the head of which had been eaten by wild dogs, leaving only the legs and body. Three or four wild dogs were fighting over it. One of the people traveling with the reporter said that there were two more corpses ahead that had been half-eaten by wild dogs and had not yet been buried.</p>
<p>Unable to Advance East The reporter originally wanted to go east to Yongxing Road, but the more he went east, the more Japanese soldiers there were. The more people were retreating. They urged the reporter not to go any further, saying that two people had been found by Japanese soldiers to be wearing rings and had been tied up on the spot with ropes. We had to plead with them in every way to get them released. Soon, it would be 4:00 PM, and the Japanese soldiers would prohibit pedestrians. The eastern section was also a restricted area, and no one was allowed to pass. At this point, the reporter had no choice but to turn back. He saw a team of Japanese soldiers speeding by in cars behind him. We hid in a small alley to avoid them. When we crossed the railway, we were again inspected by the Japanese army. We returned by ferry.</p>
<p>Inspection by Japanese Officers Japanese soldiers used white chalk to write Chinese notices on the street signs, the general meaning of which was that the Japanese army had no intention of harming Chinese merchants and civilians. Because there were gangsters robbing and stealing items, Chinese people could pass through empty-handed, but were not allowed to carry items, etc. When the reporter returned to Datong Road, he saw the Japanese commander inspecting Zhabei. He was traveling in three cars, with a protective escort in front and behind, and motorcycle escorts on the sides, heading west. The Japanese soldiers along the way saluted him. It was said that the three officers were Ueda, Nomura, and Shiozawa, all wearing yellow major-general uniforms.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Inspection Record of Wusong <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Heartbreaking Sight of High-Flying Japanese Flags</p>
<p>Seven or Eight of the Houses in the Whole Town are Gone</p>
<p>First Report In order to understand the situation in Wusong after the war, the people from all walks of life in Wusong who had taken refuge in Shanghai specially dispatched Dong Zhenqian, Zhu Xiaoyan, etc., to take the Wusong Rescue Bureau's small boat to inspect Song on the morning of yesterday. The reporter also went along. The small boat sailed to Wusong and docked at the Hanchuan Wharf. When the reporter and others landed, two Japanese soldiers with guns approached the wharf and asked in Shandong accent where the small boat had come from. After we told them that we were all Song people and had come from Shanghai for inspection, the Japanese soldiers allowed us to land. At that time, Zhou, a crew member of the small boat, also followed behind us. When the Japanese soldiers saw that Zhou was wearing short clothes, they immediately stopped him and searched him all over. As a result, they found a box of Golden Mouse brand cigarettes. The Japanese soldiers threw the Golden Mouse brand cigarettes on the ground and stomped on them, and said to Zhou, "You are not allowed to smoke these cigarettes. Now I will compensate you with a box." As they spoke, they took out a box of Fairy brand cigarettes from their military uniform and gave it to Zhou, saying that these Fairy brand cigarettes were Japanese goods from our Great Japan, and you can buy Fairy brand in the future, and don't buy Golden Mouse brand, etc. Zhou did not argue with them. After we landed, we inspected the whole town, but we saw that almost no houses south of the city river had survived. The remaining ruins and broken walls were shocking. Only the post office and Yansheng Money House on Songxing Road were still safe and sound. Fortunately, fewer houses north of the city river had been destroyed. Currently, there are more than 200 Japanese soldiers stationed in the Beixieye Lane in that area. Yao Kun, the person in charge of the lane, had not left since the outbreak of the war in Wusong, even though the artillery fire was fierce every day. According to Yao, after our army retreated from Song a few days ago, the Japanese army soon entered Song Town and intended to set fire to the houses in the lane. Later, after Yao begged for mercy, they were spared. Later, the Japanese army entered Baoshan City and intended to set fire again. Fortunately, Dong Zaisheng, the former City Alderman of Baoshan County, pleaded bitterly with the Japanese soldiers, and the entire city was also preserved. The houses in Baoshan City were less damaged, etc. Japanese flags were hanging high everywhere on the ruins of Wusong. It is said that these Japanese flags were all issued by the Japanese soldiers. Looking from afar, the reporter saw that there was also a Japanese flag on the Wusong Fort. The Tongji University originally flew the German flag, but it has now been changed to the Japanese flag. The reporter and others returned to Shanghai on the original boat at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Second Report Yesterday, the reporter paid respects to Wusong Town. He saw that the seawall on the outer road had been damaged by artillery fire in a jagged manner. Japanese soldiers were patrolling in groups on the outer road. They stopped and questioned suspicious pedestrians. Those who did not have any contraband were allowed to walk freely. Then, the reporter inspected the streets and saw that 70-80% of all the houses in the town had been destroyed, which was a scene of desolation. Due to the rush of time, it was not possible to conduct a detailed investigation. The following is a preliminary record of what was seen and heard yesterday. Places that have not been surveyed will be reported to readers again. 1. (Zhongxin Road) From the outer road to Shibei Road, all were burned down. 2. (Songxing Road) From Miaolong in the east to Youche Road in the west, except for Longmao Money House, Post Office, Xu Hezhou, Gu Shouan, Wanshun New House, etc., the remaining five houses were spared, but the rest were all destroyed. 3. (Tongxing Road) The part from the outer road to Songxing Road has been destroyed. 4. (Doushi Road) From Guizhi Road to Sanyi Road, all were destroyed. 5. (Tongtai Road) Songxing Road burned to Beishi River. 6. (Hefeng Road) Zhongxin Road burned to Sanyang Road. Among them, the houses in Xieye Xinli are still burning, which is said to be the work of bandits. 7. Japanese flags are hung on the Central University Medical College on Taixing Road and several undamaged houses in Zhujiabang on Shibei Road, which are probably used by the Japanese soldiers as offices. 8. It is said that local people in Baoshan have invited strong men to gather for self-defense, so they have not been burned and robbed by villains, and the order is safe.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Cai, Jiang, and Dai Respond to the External Telegram <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Reuters Nanjing, 5th, Telegraph. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an urgent telegram this morning to the Headquarters of the 19th Route Army, asking whether the news of the Chinese army's victory was true. In the afternoon, it received a reply telegram issued by Cai, Jiang, and Dai at noon, denying the claim that the Chinese army had recovered Liuhang, and stated that the Japanese army had advanced to the outskirts of Nanxiang and occupied Jiading. The Japanese army is now fiercely attacking from Nanxiang. The Chinese army's front line is now in Anting. The purpose of the Japanese army's offensive is not yet clear. The headquarters of the 19th Route Army is now located in Zhengyi, west of Kunshan.</p>
<p>During Martial Law</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Authorities Forbid Setting Off Firecrackers <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau stated that last night, when the citizens of the city were overjoyed by the arrival of a large group of reinforcements, firecrackers were suddenly set off in the southern city and other places during martial law. The general public did not know the underlying reasons and were all terrified, which easily disturbed the people and also violated the martial law regulations. Therefore, at 4:00 PM yesterday (5th), two cars were specially prepared, with white cloths displaying clear announcements wrapped around the cars, stating, "During martial law, it is forbidden to set off firecrackers. Violators will be punished without leniency." The cars circled the city to show the prohibition.</p>
<p>In the British and French concessions, residents set off firecrackers last night. However, during this period of martial law, it was feared that misunderstandings would easily occur. In view of the fact that the Chinese military and police authorities have always prohibited the setting off of firecrackers during martial law, the concession authorities have also followed suit and issued a clear ban.</p>

<p>Denial of Suggesting the Formation of a National Defense Government</p>
<p>Xu Chongzhi yesterday telegraphed to Xiao Focheng and Deng Zheru in Guangzhou, stating, "Shanghai newspapers reported a Hong Kong dispatch, saying that I suggested forming a national defense government in Guangdong, and you, brothers, considering the national crisis is worsening and that we cannot afford further division, telegraphed back to reject it. I am extremely surprised. Since the Manchurian Incident, I have advocated concentrating national strength to persist in resisting Japan to save the country from peril. I have never made the above suggestion. There must be villains deliberately spreading rumors to confuse the public. I earnestly request you to send someone to investigate thoroughly and kindly ask you to correct the reports in Hong Kong and Guangdong newspapers to avoid misunderstandings." [Signed] Xu Chongzhi, bowing humbly.</p>

<p>Since the Beijing-Shanghai train service was interrupted, the China National Aviation Corporation's passengers and mail have suddenly become congested. However, the seats on the planes are limited, and latecomers often find themselves without a seat. It is reported that the company, to facilitate transportation and to meet the requests of people in both locations, will, starting from the 8th of this month, operate special flights from both Beijing and Shanghai once a day, in addition to the regular flights. The flight departs from Nanjing at 8:30 AM and from Shanghai at 2:30 PM. The service will operate even on Sundays. The ticket price remains at 60 yuan for a one-way ticket and 105 yuan for a round trip. Mail from Shanghai to Suzhou and Wuxi can also be transported to Nanjing by this flight and then transferred to various locations by train. Similarly, mail from Suzhou and Wuxi to Shanghai can be transported to Nanjing by train first and then transported to Shanghai by plane, ensuring same-day delivery.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Yuan Liang and Others Discuss the Recent Situation of the Communist Bandits in Jiangxi <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Hope for Clearing Them Out in the Shortest Possible Time</p>
<p>Yuan Liang and Xiong Yuxi, members of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, recently came to Shanghai on official business and described the recent situation of the Communist bandits in Jiangxi as follows: "We have come to Shanghai on official business this time, and we have witnessed the enthusiastic patriotic spirit of the people of Shanghai in resisting Japan, which we deeply admire. Our indignation is unified. As for the Communist bandits in Jiangxi, their ambition and violence, seeking to destroy China through communism, are exactly the same as Japan's military aggression against China. It must be understood that resisting Japan is saving the country, and suppressing the Communists is also saving the country. The people of the country already know that they must exert the nation's strength to resist Japan. However, it should also be recognized that the Communist bandits, who are rampant in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, are invisibly restraining our entire anti-Japanese plan, directly dividing our anti-Japanese forces. Therefore, the Japanese disaster is acute, and resistance must be long-term and chronic; the Communist disaster is chronic, and its eradication must be short-term and acute. Various counties in central Jiangxi have been harmed by the Communist bandits for four years. According to recent surveys, the population loss in each county has reached 3.5 million, and property losses have reached 800 million to 1 billion. Their burning and killing are cruel, their oppression is severe, they kill the good and harm the youth, fields are abandoned, the starving are everywhere, they destroy the people's character, and reduce humanity to nothing. I recall that Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek said in his address to the people of Jiangxi that 'so-called communization is animalization.' Last June, Commander-in-Chief Chiang personally dispatched a large number of troops to Jiangxi to search and suppress the bandits. The important bandit strongholds in southern Jiangxi have been broken one by one, and the bandit filth in western and eastern Jiangxi has also been gradually cleared. There was hope for complete pacification by a set date. Unfortunately, the disaster in Liaoning and Ning occurred, causing the fixed plans to be abandoned in one fell swoop. Now, the number of troops suppressing the bandits in central Jiangxi is not as large as before, so the bandit forces in the eastern and western counties of Jiangxi have taken the opportunity to rise up again. As for the bandits in southern Jiangxi, they have also reoccupied their old nests, and their cunning and elusiveness, the expansion of the bandit areas, cannot be completely cleared by the current troops stationed in Jiangxi. In addition, recently, Ganzhou is urgently requesting aid, hoping that Guangdong will send troops to assist in the suppression, because Ganzhou is closely connected to Ji'an, and Ji'an is the shield of Nanchang. Supporting the current situation relies entirely on the existing military strength. If there is an order for further conscription, Nanchang will lose its defense, and the disaster of the Communist bandits will inevitably extend to the Yangtze River basin. If the natural barrier of the Yangtze River is obstructed and collapses, not only Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui will be in danger of being communized at the same time, but also our entire nation, which is now in pain and calling out, believing that long-term resistance will win the final victory, will also be in danger of being destroyed, isolated, boiling over, and falling apart like fish. The facts are present, and there is no way to avoid them, and it is also something we cannot bear to say. Now, we earnestly hope that the central government will order the troops suppressing the bandits in central Jiangxi to clear them out within the shortest possible time, and we deeply hope that Guangdong will send troops as soon as possible to assist Jiangxi and Fujian, achieving the effect of a pincer attack. If the Communist bandits can be cleared out in the shortest possible time, then the harm to the heart will be eliminated. On the people's side, they can concentrate their efforts on the anti-Japanese work, and the troops engaged in suppressing the Communists can also be transferred to the war zone in full force, increasing the strength of resistance against Japan. Therefore, the faster the Communist suppression, the greater the effect of resisting Japan; the more urgent the resistance against Japan, the heavier the responsibility of suppressing the Communists. This is our humble opinion, and we urgently hope that our countrymen will pay closer attention to the Communist suppression work while vehemently calling for resistance against Japan."</p>

Furthermore, the horseracing department of the race club raised 1,476 yuan and 5 jiao.

<p>Maotai Chinese Employees Donate Unceasingly: The entire Chinese staff of the British firm Maotai Foreign Firm have already sent two terms of long-term consolation money. Today, they sent the third term of consolation money, 100 yuan in foreign currency, entrusting us to forward it, and wrote a letter saying, "Although our army has withdrawn in full force, the enemy's plans to attack have not diminished, so our army continues to resist, which is expected. Therefore, we and other colleagues still adhere to the initial purpose and continue to send this donation as usual, and will not stop because the war has stopped. We hope that our compatriots will continue to work hard with this sincere heart." The employees of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company initiated the consolidation effort. Since the Japanese invaders trespassed and our army bravely resisted and repeatedly defeated the powerful enemy, compatriots from all walks of life have risen up to donate. Now we hear that the employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinfeng vessel first initiated the effort, trying their best to donate by each vessel as a unit. Now, the Xinfeng vessel alone has raised 65 yuan in foreign currency, entrusting us to send it to the front lines. Other vessels have all heard the news and are rising up. They will donate one after another within a few days.</p>

<p>The Resolution Passed by the General Assembly the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Will Consider Violations of This Recommendation as a Serious Incident</p>
<p>(Geneva) At 4:15 PM today, the League of Nations Council met in the committee room.

There was almost no space in the room, and many people stood and listened.</p>

<p>After the Speaker, Hyman, took his seat, he first read a letter from the Chinese representative, Dr. Yan, mentioning conflicting news from Shanghai regarding the ceasefire and the continuation of the war. After Hyman read the letter, he asked the Japanese representative, Matsudaira, for his opinion. Matsudaira then submitted an official document stating that although the Japanese troops in the field are still being shot at by Chinese regular soldiers and plainclothes soldiers, the main war has stopped. Japanese troops have returned fire because of the shooting by Chinese soldiers, but this occasional contact does not involve the Japanese army's attitude under the ceasefire, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Requesting Accurate Information <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Yan suggested that since this issue is not clear, it seems appropriate to ask the commanders of the British, American, French, and Italian fleets stationed in Shanghai to provide accurate information on whether the war has stopped. Secretary-General Drummond said that he had already telegraphed the Shanghai Committee yesterday, asking them to provide information on the situation as soon as possible, especially focusing on the war situation. British Foreign Secretary Simon, representing the British government, agreed to seek the latest and most accurate report from the British representative in Shanghai for the Council. He believed that representatives of other countries would be willing to actively cooperate in this matter so that the Council could know all the truth in Shanghai. Simon also said that at 4:00 PM yesterday, Dr. Yan stated that both parties had accepted the truce conditions. Later, he heard that China only accepted the ceasefire conditions at 12:00 AM in Shanghai, which was when Dr. Yan was speaking in Geneva. However, in any case, there is now some progress, because both parties now have the intention of a ceasefire. Representatives from France and Italy both agreed to instruct their representatives in Shanghai to cooperate in clarifying this situation. The French representative, Peng Gu, said that he knew the Council would not be able to take sufficient action while the war had not stopped. He had telegraphed Paris to inquire about information, he said. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e28">A Battle of Words Between Chinese and Japanese Representatives <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The highlight of today's League of Nations Council meeting was the verbal battle between the Chinese representative, Yan Huiqing, and the Japanese representative, Sato. The Council eventually passed a resolution requesting the Chinese and Japanese governments to implement a ceasefire and declaring that the Council would consider violations of this recommendation to be a serious matter. The general impression here is that the Council is preparing to adopt stricter measures than the Administrative Council. During his debate with Sato, Dr. Yan stated that the Japanese army was still fighting with the aim of controlling the entire region, reaching as far as Nanjing. Upon hearing this, Sato rose to strongly defend his position, stating that he could not understand the conflicting reports coming from Shanghai, but he could emphatically declare that the Japanese army had first ceased fire on March 1. Since then, the Japanese army has not fought again, because the fighting has indeed stopped. After a major war, minor skirmishes are inevitable, but he hoped that these post-war ripples would quickly subside. Today's difficulty lies in the separation of the two sides' armies. He believed that this matter should be decided by the confronting parties themselves. He welcomed the on-the-spot collection of reliable information. He stated that Japan requests the cooperation of related countries in seeking a peaceful situation and is willing to participate in a round table conference immediately after a compromise is reached. Once the situation has calmed down, the Japanese army can be withdrawn. He can solemnly declare that Japan does not want to establish a concession. In his opinion, a round table conference can resolve permanent conflicts and contribute to an orderly and peaceful era within the Shanghai area. When Sato finished speaking, Dr. Yan immediately rose to speak, saying, "Gentlemen, do not be misled by Mr. Sato's words. I have just received three telegrams, which I will now read." Yan said that the telegrams stated that the Japanese army was continuing to advance fiercely, that the Japanese army was landing near Wusong, and that eight Japanese troop transport ships had entered the Yangtze River in the afternoon. Dr. Yan continued, stating that 35,000 Japanese soldiers were continuously landing, carrying tanks, and planning to encircle the Chinese army positions near Kunshan. Kunshan is 40 miles from Shanghai, which is twice the distance that the Japanese wanted the Chinese army to withdraw. The commanders of the neutral countries' fleets stationed in Shanghai should immediately investigate this location and devise ceasefire measures. The representatives of Britain, France, and Italy all made temporary calming statements, saying that they had already asked their military representatives to provide reliable information. Sato spoke about Dr. Yan's claim that 35,000 new Japanese soldiers were continuously landing, saying that this army was clearly a reinforcement that would soon be withdrawn. Dr. Yan was still not satisfied with his response and demanded that the Council immediately take measures to promote a ceasefire, saying that China cannot be satisfied with the Japanese army commander's one-sided declaration, because such a declaration can be reversed at any time. If everything is handled by the two sides' military commanders, then why was this Council convened? Sato said that the reinforcements sent to Shanghai were dispatched before the ceasefire and must of course land at the scheduled location, but they can obviously be withdrawn. Upon hearing this, the audience burst into laughter. Council Chairman Hymans quickly ordered the assembly to maintain order. Dr. Yan was at a loss for a response, so Council Chairman Hymans interjected, saying, "The disturbing news we have heard in Dr. Yan's report makes the situation even more uncertain. The time has come to have a concrete form of the intention expressed today." The Council Chairman then announced a recess so that a specially designated committee could draft a resolution. At 6:50 PM, the meeting continued. Council Chairman Hymans presented the following resolution: The League of Nations Council, recalling the Administrative Council's resolution of February 28 and other measures to be taken, 1) requests the Chinese and Japanese governments to immediately take necessary steps to ensure the effective implementation of the orders issued by both sides' military authorities to cease hostilities; 2) regarding the request in Article 1, the League of Nations Council should be notified of the actual situation of how both sides are proceeding; 3) the League of Nations Council recommends that the Chinese and Japanese representatives, with the assistance of the above-mentioned countries' land and sea military authorities, hold negotiations to seek a definitive cessation of hostilities and to arrange for the withdrawal of the Japanese army. The League of Nations Council also hopes that neutral countries will report to the Council on the progress of the negotiations at any time. Sato proposed amending Article 3 of the resolution, saying that the scope of the negotiations stipulated therein should include not only the arrangement for the withdrawal of the Japanese army but also the discussion of the future defense zone of the Chinese army. He said that this amendment was because Japanese representative Matsudaira believed that what the League of Nations Council could resolve was not only the details of the withdrawal of the Japanese army, but also the conditions for the Japanese army to implement the withdrawal should also be resolved. Sato repeatedly stated that Japan was prepared to withdraw its troops immediately upon the restoration of peace. Sato and British representative Simon had some discussion about the correct meaning of the word "arrangement" in the resolution, and their opinions differed greatly. Council Chairman Hymans then asked the Council to express its wishes regarding the wording of the resolution. Thereupon, the discussion at the meeting went beyond the previously limited scope. Motta rose amidst cheers and spoke sincerely and friendly, saying, "My friend Sato, accept the text of this resolution. If the word 'arrangement' is changed to 'formality,' then various doubts can be eliminated." Czech representative Beneš agreed with his proposal. Dr. Yan said that if Article 3 of the resolution referred to a ceasefire instead of referring to the Shanghai Conference, and if the resolution did not stipulate the conditions for the Japanese army to withdraw from the occupied territory, then he could accept this case. Sato was still not satisfied, but because there was a guarantee of speech, he first withdrew his amendment. Simon then asked all those present to pass this case. The case was put to a vote and passed unanimously, and the Japanese representative did not object either. The representatives had smiles on their faces. The Council Chairman expressed his final hope, saying that the unanimous agreement of the Council was a good omen for the future. The crowd applauded and answered, and then the meeting adjourned. The meeting will reconvene tomorrow (Saturday) at 10:30 AM. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Small Countries Speak Fairly <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The big guns of the League of Nations Administrative Council have now fallen silent, and the light artillery of the small countries of the League of Nations Council are now thundering. Yesterday, the interventions of Messrs. Piens and Motta were very effective, and Council Chairman Hymans' handling of the situation has won universal praise. The League of Nations held a meeting without being disturbed by news of the war, which was the first time in several weeks. The meeting opened at 10:45 AM today. Secretary-General Drummond announced that he had received a telegram from the American ambassador acknowledging receipt of the League of Nations Council's resolution and promising the United States' cooperation in the Shanghai case on behalf of Secretary of State Stimson. Sato then rose to speak, analyzing in detail Dr. Yan's remarks of yesterday regarding Japan's continued acts of hostility and refuting them one by one, calling them exaggerations. He then asked the League of Nations Council not to be misled by similar news reports. Dr. Yan immediately rose to argue with him, saying that even today, he had received new news that Japan's acts of hostility had not completely stopped. Council Chairman Hymans tried to stop this debate, but Sato still asked to say a few more words to clarify a few points, saying that he had no intention of having the Chinese delegation bear the responsibility for the unfounded rumors coming from Shanghai. He specifically denied the accuracy of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi's envoy to China, Matsuoka's talks. China said that Japan spent 30 million yen on propaganda in Europe and the United States, and asked Dr. Yan to provide evidence. French representative Boncour was not happy that conflicting news was constantly being transmitted, saying that this was inevitable until a neutral zone was established. He also said that he had received news from Shanghai that the war had actually stopped. British representative Simon then rose to read a telegram from the British Commander-in-Chief, confirming the statement that the war had stopped except for minor skirmishes, saying that he hoped that the temporary fighting between our two friends here would stop, so that the Council could proceed with more beneficial matters. Council Chairman Hymans then asked Norwegian representative Bull to speak. Bull strongly urged the Council not to engage in unnecessary exploration and to pursue a legal resolution, so that the Council's position could be spared criticism. Bull also strongly urged the Council to first establish articles sufficient to effectively prevent combat actions, and then consider practical ways to resolve the entire case. This step should not be limited to articles alone, because the world's public opinion is now universally hoping that if any of the parties do not respect the Council's resolution, then the League of Nations should take appropriate plans to vigorously implement this resolution. Next, Colombian representative Restrepo spoke, advising the Council to wait quietly for the results of the negotiations conducted under the auspices of the League of Nations, because these negotiations have not yet broken down. He then reiterated the points made in the declarations made by France, Spain, Guatemala, Peru, and Panama at previous League of Nations Administrative Councils, namely, prohibiting the invasion of other countries' territories in order to protect the fulfillment of treaties, implementing the revision of treaties under military coercion, opening troops to</p>
<p>Entering another country to guard affairs, forcibly occupying the goods of defaulting countries with military occupation, and vigorously implementing various rights and economic concessions. Restrepo strongly advocated that this was the policy that the Council should abide by. He was prepared to endorse any resolution that defended these principles and maintained the integrity of the League of Nations' authority. Next, Swedish representative Löfgren spoke, asking the Council to endorse the letter sent by the Administrative Council to Japan on February 16, saying that the use of troops landing on other countries' territories was a clear violation of the League of Nations Charter. A member state cannot use special circumstances as a tactic to avoid the application of the League of Nations Charter. The League of Nations Charter was painstakingly created. If the Council cannot restore peace based on fairness, then it is in danger of breaking down. Next, Finnish representative Ehrström spoke, saying that a resolution that is not a Platonic resolution, and that avoids non-sincere textual interpretations, should be the main theme of the current</p>
<p>Important discussion. Ehrström requested that an agreement be reached on a plan aimed at supporting the League of Nations in vigorously implementing its will for peace in accordance with justice, and earnestly requested that Finland's historical friendship with China and Japan be taken as proof that this request came from sincerity. Next, Dutch representative Beelaerts van Blokland spoke, focusing on the persistent nature of the dispute, which has lasted for six months, and all efforts to resolve it have been ineffective. Beelaerts van Blokland agreed with Ehrström, saying that the Netherlands is willing to maintain good relations with both China and Japan and does not want to attribute blame to any party. However, the sound of Chinese cannons booming is a shameful result of the League of Nations' discussion of the problem. Now, we must use earnest determination to stop the bloodshed and stop the realization of harmful effects. If we fail, then the entire organized international peace plan will be destroyed. Next, Mexican representative Urtaga spoke, saying that he was willing to endorse a plan that could guarantee respect for the entire League of Nations Charter without being constrained by racial and geographical reasons, so that the principles of government, humanity, and justice could be firmly upheld.

<p>Advocating Round Table Conference to Discuss Two Issues</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa does not want to comment on the recent developments in Sino-Japanese relations today, but Japanese official circles falsely accuse China of intentionally delaying the opening of the preparatory meeting for the Shanghai case, which may make Geneva anxious. It is heard that the Japanese government has a new instruction to its representative to the League of Nations, Matsudaira, but the content is unknown. Official circles here advocate that the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the issue of the defense of the public concession should be discussed simultaneously at the Shanghai Round Table Conference. This meeting should be convened even if China does not participate, and the results of the discussion should be notified to China. It is also said that after Japan put forward the basic conditions for resolving the Shanghai case, China expressed its inability to accept it, but has not yet put forward a counter-proposal. Japan is extremely willing to have representatives from various countries participate in the preparatory meeting, and its location is also willing to be held in a completely neutral place such as the British warship HMS Kent.

<h3 id="e34">Soviet Russia Increases Border Defense <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>A Confidential Memorial from a Japanese VIP is Leaked</p>
<p>Today, the Riga Soviet Russian Izvestia accused Japan of having a real plan to militarily occupy Soviet Russian territory in the Far East, saying that the Russian government now has documentary evidence proving that Japan intends to occupy the main areas east of Lake Baikal as soon as possible. Therefore, Russia should immediately and actively strengthen its border defenses, and must deal with the activities of the Manchurian White Russians, because the White Russians there have now received assistance and are clearly preparing to invade Soviet Russia. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian semi-official newspaper Izvestia broke its silence for several months yesterday by criticizing Japan for preparing for war against Russia in a commentary. Today, it disclosed a confidential memorial from a certain Japanese VIP. The name of the VIP was not published, but it was said that it was well known to the Russian government. It is said that the memorial stated that, in view of the current general state of Soviet Russia, it can be determined that it is incapable of fighting. Therefore, this is a very good opportunity for the empire to resolve the Far East problem. Poland and Romania, Russia's western neighbors, can still act in concert with us at present, but if a few more years pass, this possibility will decrease. The newspaper commentary said that this document may be regarded as a personal opinion, but the initiator of this invasion plan is in a prominent position, and even his personal opinion has political power. We must be extremely vigilant and pay attention to all events that have occurred on the Far Eastern border. Moreover, Soviet Russia proposed to Japan to negotiate an non-aggression treaty two months ago, and the Japanese government still believes that there is no need to reply, and its intention is known. The secret memorial cited by the newspaper also stated that Japan must adopt a firm policy towards Russia and be prepared to fight at any time. Our true intention is of course not to prevent redization, but to occupy eastern Siberia. Japan must quickly start a war with Russia. If it delays, the situation will become more favorable to Soviet Russia, and it is planned to occupy Siberia to the area of Lake Baikal. If it can obtain full cooperation from European countries, it will not be difficult to advance further west. The newspaper also cited another document, indicating Japan's desire to use the White Russians to disturb Soviet Russia. It is said that the document stated that if Japan only attacks from the Far East, it will be difficult to control Soviet Russia's lifeline. Therefore, propaganda must be regarded as one of the most important activities. It is not difficult for Russia's western neighbors and other countries to be drawn into the war against Russia through the effect of propaganda, and at the same time, it can also use the White Russians within and outside the country to make them internally disintegrate. The newspaper commentary claimed that since Japan expanded its scope of occupation in the three northeastern provinces, the conspiracy of the White Russians there has also become more numerous, and there are facts to prove this. We must pay extreme attention and take the necessary plans to defend our territory and resist invasion. Although Soviet Russia holds a policy of peace, it cannot have a policy of ignoring the facts. It must show the world that if anyone invades its territory, Soviet Russia is prepared to fight. (National News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov, the chief representative to the Disarmament Conference, returned to Beijing on the 2nd of this month, stayed for only 36 hours, and hastily returned to Geneva last night. According to reliable sources, Litvinov's trip was to discuss something with government leaders. However, it is not yet known whether the documents that the Russian government claimed to have obtained that are sufficient to prove that Japanese VIPs are plotting to attack Soviet Russia as soon as possible will be used at the League of Nations General Assembly.

A few days ago, the Soviet Russian government requested the Japanese government to explain the matter of transporting troops at the Japanese side's request. After that, the Soviet Russian government agreed to transport troops as far as Hailin. Currently, Japanese troops are also stationed in Yimianpo. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>

<p>To Mayor Wu of Shanghai, forwarded to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Military Commander Cai, Commander Dai, Military Commander Zhang, and conveyed to all soldiers: Since the brutal enemy recklessly deployed land, sea, and air forces, wielding their superior weapons to oppress Shanghai and Songhu, it has been more than a month. Our armed comrades in Shanghai and Songhu, upon orders to defend our land, adhering to the legacy of Premier Sun's spiritual education, sacrifice themselves for the survival of the nation, shedding blood in the face of danger, regarding death as homecoming, engaging in hand-to-hand combat day and night without respite. The Premier encouraged our comrades with the spirit of loyalty, righteousness, benevolence, and courage. Our comrades must vow to demonstrate it to the death. Our ancestors bequeathed to us, their descendants, the solemn and magnificent mountains and rivers. We must vow to protect them to the death. The soldiers of Shanghai and Songhu have already devoted themselves to this cause. The Central Government resolves to mobilize all the nation's resources and manpower to continue the effort, striving for the survival of the nation and seeking to safeguard international treaties. This change of strategy, the restructuring and reorganization, fill us with concern upon receiving the report. The Central Government wishes to make a solemn vow to our soldiers: to share life and death. The congress, based on this intention, respectfully observed a moment of silence on March 4th to mourn the fallen soldiers. In addition to the proposal to the National Government to provide generous pensions to those who fought for the country and were killed or wounded, a telegram is sent first to express condolences. The Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (March 4th). (Luoyang) The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee on the 4th passed a telegram to console compatriots in the war zone. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To Mayor Wu of Shanghai, forwarded to all newspaper offices and organizations, and conveyed to people from all walks of life: Since the Mukden Incident, the Northeast and the Jiangnan region have been subjected to enemy aggression. The Shanghai and Songhu war zone, in particular, has suffered the most severe sacrifices. While our armed comrades have been ordered by the Central Government to defend the country to the death, our compatriots in the war zone have either fallen as corpses, shedding blood, and striving to become national martyrs, or have lost their homes and property, yet still contribute to the national crisis. Some bandage the wounds of soldiers, disregarding the survival of their relatives. Others attempt to destroy enemy weapons, willing to sacrifice themselves in the river without regret. The tragic sacrifices of the people of Jiangnan and the arduous struggle of the Northeastern Volunteer Army are all supreme manifestations of the spirit of the Chinese nation. The victory of this spirit is the foundation for the revival and greatness of our nation. The plenary session respectfully offers infinite admiration for this, and expresses profound condolences to our innocent compatriots who have perished. As for relief matters, it should be proposed to the National Government to quickly and properly devise a plan. During this military period, the scope of the war zone will be determined by the strategic necessities. However, the Central Government's determination for long-term resistance remains consistent. We hope that our patriotic compatriots will forever pledge to cooperate and assist each other with sincerity, and strive together for the survival of the nation. We hereby send this telegram to express our condolences and encourage mutual effort. The Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (March 4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Important Figure in the Japanese Business World</p>
<h3 id="e38">Baron Takuma Dan Assassinated <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Assailant Has Been Arrested</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Baron Takuma Dan, a prominent director of Mitsui &amp; Co. and an important figure in the business world, was shot and killed by an unidentified assassin at 12:20 PM today. Takuma Dan was getting out of his car in front of Mitsui &amp; Co. when he was struck by a bullet, sustaining serious injuries and falling to the ground. He died from his injuries in less than half an hour. The motive for the assassination is unknown, but it is widely believed that it was due to rumors that Mitsui &amp; Co. anticipated the Seiyukai party coming to power and reimposing the gold embargo, thus profiting from speculation by several trillion yen, with many suffering as a result. The assassin was motivated by this anger. Mitsui &amp; Co. denies the speculation, but states that its purchase of US dollars was a legitimate commercial transaction. Recently, a group of demonstrators entered the company to question this matter. Further report: It is now known that</p>
<p>the assassin is named Hiko Komma, a close friend of Komma, who assassinated Inoue. The two had previously discussed forming the Greater Japan National Party. It is also learned that the pistol with which Komma shot Inoue was stolen from Lieutenant Ito of the Navy, who was recently wounded in Shanghai. Two pistols were stolen at the time, and the whereabouts of the other one are unknown. It may have been given to Hiko Komma, and that one was used today to kill Takuma Dan. Takuma Dan was 72 years old. After graduating from the mining engineering department of the Boston Institute of Technology in the United States, he returned to China to teach for several years. He then served as a government</p>
<p>employee at the Meteorological Observatory. Later, he served at the Miike Coal Mine. When Mitsui &amp; Co. purchased the mine, he joined the company and eventually became one of its directors. Takuma Dan was also one of the signatories of the letter to the editor published recently in the London Times by Viscount Ishii and other prominent figures. (Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The assassin who killed Takuma Dan, chairman of Mitsui &amp; Co., is named Hishi Gorō. The police authorities believe he has communist affiliations, but the assassin firmly denies having any accomplices. He only admitted to arriving in Tokyo a week ago to investigate Dan's movements, address, and car number. The police authorities are now searching for accomplices. After Takuma Dan's death, Mitsui &amp; Co. plans to hold a company funeral. The League of Nations investigation team suspended its trip to Nikko on the 6th to pay respects. (Far Eastern News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The assassin of Takuma Dan has now been arrested. His name is Nishinuma and he is only 23 years old. He is currently being held in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and is not allowed to communicate with outsiders. An active investigation is underway. (Kokumin News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

It also stated that there are currently 30 factories producing military poison gas in various countries, with France ranking first, followed by Czechoslovakia, Poland in third place, and Belgium in fourth place. Czechoslovakia has eight specialized factories manufacturing this substance. It was also stated that large arms manufacturers are currently campaigning against disarmament. Since the first shot was fired in the Shanghai area, the stocks of various arms manufacturers on international stock exchanges have been strong. These factories naturally hope for brisk sales of their products, and are thus a part of the opposition to disarmament. (Kokumin News Agency dispatch, 4th) Academia Sinica</p>

<p>A Ceasefire Is Not a Problem</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Should Withdraw Quickly</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Ministry telegraphed Yen Hui-Ch'ing, stating that a ceasefire notified by the League of Nations presents no problem for us. However, the conditions proposed by Japan in Shanghai resemble those of a victor and violate the original intention of mutual concession. Therefore, they have not yet been accepted. China has now retreated to the second line of defense and has not launched an attack. It is hoped that the Japanese troops will be ordered to withdraw quickly so that a round-table conference can be convened. It was also stated that over 70 innocent civilians in Shanghai have been killed and injured by artillery fire and aircraft, and thousands of houses have been destroyed.

(Special Dispatch, 5th) (Beiping) Jiang Bocheng said that yesterday he received telegrams from He Yingqin and Zhang Qun, stating that reinforcements have arrived continuously and are counterattacking. The reason for the slow advance of the reinforcements is that certain units were ordered to go south to Shanghai from Tianjin, and when they arrived in Chuzhou, the Central Government feared that the unit would cross the Yangtze River from Pukou, attracting the attention of the Japanese, so it ordered them to go east on foot from Chuzhou, which slowed down their arrival in Shanghai. The rumors are all untrue. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee was convened by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei. Chiang Kai-shek personally stayed in Nanjing to oversee the situation in Shanghai due to the emergency in Shanghai.
