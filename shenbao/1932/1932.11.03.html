<h3 id="c1">擴大救濟東北難民月捐運動　誠 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>邇近上海各界人士。鑒於東北各地義軍艱苦奮鬭之争待接濟與陷於水深火熱之東北三千萬同胞急待救援。特發起舉行月捐運動。以救死扶傷其宣言有曰。「人而不欲行善則已。苟欲行善。救死扶傷。此即最大之行善。人而不欲報國則已。苟欲將國。國破家亡。此即最後之報國。」語至沉痛。聲尤激越。吾人認爲我國人如尙未忍忘懷被暴日宰制下之東北三千萬同胞及半壁山河。則對於此種月捐運動。自應急響應。并力助其擴大。</p>
<p>溯自去年九一八禍變突起。東北淪於暴日刦持之下。迄今歷時一載有餘。坐致僞國之傀儡劇。公然登塲。日本且公然正式承認傀儡政權。而我舉國熙熙。驕奢逸樂。一如曩昔。若商女之不知有亡國恨。若燕處飛幕而不自知危。獨東北自動奮起之義軍。爲恢復失地。爲爭取我民族之人格。爲爭取我民族之人格。終始以堅忍卓絕之精神。與强敵作艱苦持久之搏戰。悲壯之血。灑遍破碎河山。其忠義壯烈。實足以泣鬼神而動天地。至若東北三千萬同胞。國未亡而家先破。種未滅而身先奴。處於暴日鐵蹄踐踏之下。宛轉掙扎。呼籲無門。如今歳哈爾濱大水爲災。人民之流離輾轉者。爲數亦衆。其苦痛之深。待援之切。蓋亦爲吾人所可想見。塞外秋草。寒風凄厲。此艱苦之義軍與難民。今正忍飢忍寒。與强敵作拚命之爭持。吾人安然食息。若竟對此義軍與難民。淡然漠視。如越人視秦人之肥瘠。不加善戚是直可謂爲毫無心肝。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人之所以呼籲國人努力擴大此運動者。其用意初非在於勸人爲善。亦非在於爲東北義軍與難民請命。冀以動「仁人」之「惻隱。」吾人認此運動。實即爲我民族生存前途一有力之測騐。苟我民族如尙能保持其立國之精神。如尙未忘此次重大之創痛。如不甘東北半壁河山就此淪亡。則對此運動。應格外努力。而東北失地亦必有。收回之一日。我民族生命。必可垂於久遠。反之。如舉國人民宴安耽毒。日夕苟安。死機迫近而罔覺。大難臨頭而不動心。則對此種月捐運動。自然淡漠視之。民族生命力完全消失。於此即可證明。而我民族前途之黝黑如漆。危殆更不堪設想矣。</p>
<p>抑且日侵東北。其處心積慮。蓋遠在甲午戰爭之前。在其積極大陸政策之隂謀下。斷不以旣攫取東北而滿足其野心。換言之。即其鐵蹄之蹂躪。斷不以東北爲止境。日外交時報主筆半澤玉城在滿洲應當怎様地處理一文中有云。我前次在奉天。對關東軍的參謀板垣大佐說。「我有一個親戚家的小孩子。今年亦進了陸軍士官學校。他過了二十年二十五年以後。也要變成板垣大佐。爲了後進的發展。請你們留了些工作。」板垣起初聽了。以爲在說他壞話。後來明白了我的意思。便說。「這算什麽事。滿洲問題由我們來。解决。以後還有西伯利亞問題。太平洋問題等等。子孫的工作。豈有盡期。」弦外之言。已令人不言而共喻。蓋東北事件有若火山之爆發。火山旣已爆發。斷非可立即熄滅。是則吾人今日之救援東北義軍與難民。大而言之爲救我民族。小而言之亦即爲自救。逞暴日之野心。東北人民今日所遭受之荼毒　。蓋隨時可以臨到吾人之頭上。若必待國破家亡而始覺醒。則爲時已晚。悔且無及矣。</p>
<p>吾人揣測一部分國人之心理。或者以爲吾人於救援東北義軍與難民。誠極願努力。但今日我國社會經濟破産。生計日感困難。自瞻且不暇。更有何餘力能按月捐輸。其言似是。其實則非。日本今日農村破落。情勢亦至嚴重。農村負債達七十萬元。平均每戶負債達一千元。九一八以後。日農欠稅達八千萬元。人民生計之窮蹙。蓋亦可想見。然而自東北事變以來。民間獻納國防用品一項之總額。在六百二十八萬二千六百三十日金。甚至無錢可捐。即一鷄一豕。亦罄其所有。夫彼以侵略。而其人民之捐輸。尚如此踴躍。我爲自衛。爲救。亡。寗尚不能省衣節食。盡我力之所能。以接濟義軍。以援救難民。</p>
<p>國人其起。其努力擴大此援救義軍與難民之月捐運動。我民族之前途。實以此一運動爲有力之測騐。</p>

<p>公務員小學敎師均抱反日思想</p>
<p>僞國軍隊尤不願興義勇軍作戰</p>
<p>自九一八事變後、各國於東省狀况、極爲注意、歐美人士前往實地查探者、頗屬不少、南京某軍事機關近得西人穆蘭池魏列爾之報告資料、於東省情况、叙評確當、立論深刻、惟以日方嚴密檢查、輾轉寄遞之故、致多費時日、其中一部份雖失時效、但由此可知東北雖暫淪陷、實則尙有大可爲之機、而構成東北此時之現狀、於日本及僞組織均有大不利之處、兹將該項報告資料全文、探錄如下、</p>
<p>一、滿洲里車站護路軍之暴動、即武裝抵抗日本、並反對滿洲僞府、於鐵路沿線佔領二百六十英里之地帶、致使日本處於最嚴重狀况中、且使彼等無法救濟「滿洲國」之日籍顧問、及「滿政府」中一部高級人員、現正設法要求蘇聯、向滿洲里車站附近調遣軍隊、以爲給與護路軍一重大壓迫、而滿洲日軍司令及一部高級軍官、對此更爲反對、彼等認爲護路軍之暴動、必受蘇聯暗中接濟、否則不能如此之激烈、所以必須設法抵抗、但是此種談判、至今仍無效果、總之在滿洲所搆成之狀况、對於日本非常嚴理、因此並感覺各方之意見分歧、不但日軍司令與「滿洲軍」司令彼此意見不同、即在日軍各部隊之長官間、亦各持異議、於本年八月及九月初旬、曾由日本往滿洲調去大部騎兵、（據所得之消息、此種騎兵約有兩旅、其中一旅係第四騎兵旅、其他一旅番號未詳）該騎兵到達滿洲後、其一部奉命抵抗中國義勇軍、但因高糧遍地、致使無法動作、其一部騎兵曾派往哈爾濱與中東鐵路及路線迤北一帶、但因本年哈爾濱附近水患關係、亦無何種進展、然騎兵之此種失利、於一方面曾引起滿洲日軍其他部隊對於騎兵表示不滿、而於另一方面意使騎兵司令與滿洲日軍總司令部彼此間發生極大之衝突、滿洲日軍因爲滿洲各處戰事激烈、並因其部隊分發各地之關係、而顯出其軍隊中對於救護傷兵之衛生事宜與軍中給養供給問題、無充分之準備、並缺乏擔運傷兵（以距鐵路較遠之地帶爲最困難）及醫治傷兵之人員、故有多數士兵由於以上各種關係、並因作戰日久、極感疲倦、頗有不滿其長官之表示、且有日軍部隊因給養不能按時供給、而時常由民間掠取、故於一方面激起民衆之反對、於另一方面竟放縱士兵施行刦掠、致使軍隊之紀律衰落、並給與各左傾黨有在軍中煽惑之藉口、故此日軍司令近來非常不安、</p>
<p>日本之偵探、在表面上雖似有良好之組織、但於實際確證明亦無充分之造就、只於哈爾濱一處有日本之七種偵察機關、彼等之工作、承受其本部各種軍事與行政機關之命令、且彼此無有相互之聯絡、因此彼等所得之消息、時常失去時間之效用、自滿洲事件發生之初、直至本年春間、日本在滿洲之偵察工作、曾得多數白俄僑民之補助、但以後因日本改變待遇白俄僑民之政治、並因親善蘇聯之關係、致使白俄僑民亦改變對於日本之態度、而日本方面現已撇棄白俄僑民於不顧、故此整個的白俄僑民對於日本之動作、現在亦不接受、但仍有爲日本所利用者、惟只個人關係、於整個僑民並無何種勢力也、此等爲日本利用之人民、及其住在之地點如下、哈爾濱烏些沃羅得（Ｖrerolad）伊望諾夫（Tranoff）二、斯拉洋斯克（Slavansky）三、郭羅瓦赤夫（Golavacheff）瀋陽一、克列爾日（Klerje）二、撇突沃夫（Tetoohoft）大連謝米諾夫（Sernenoff）在九月初旬、曾有由日本參謀本部軍官所組織成之調查團、奉命來滿洲、但任調查滿洲狀况、彼等調查之後、所得之結論、大略如下、黑龍江省及吉林省中東鐵路迤北之地帶、完全在中國軍隊掌握中、且當地人民與地方政府對於「滿洲國」及日本仍不承認、松花江附近一帶、其地方政府對於「新政權」雖已承認、但是當地人民不肯承認、蒙古附近一帶、（齊齊哈爾之西南、及洮南之西、）其地方政府與人民對於「夜政府」均已承認、熱河邊界一帶、對於「新政權」决不承認、且該地之人民對於「新國」及日本異常憤恨、吉林城迤東之地帶、非常危險、因當地中國人民之抗日、與反滿洲運動、能引起當地居留之鮮人之反日思想、甚至於朝鮮境内亦受其影響、該日本調查團現已明瞭只用單個軍事力量所收之效果極微、故此必須設法與抗日的中國軍隊代表談判、商議解决辦法、因爲日本與「滿洲國」於實際上僅能在鐵路尚綫區内、保護日人而已、滿洲日軍司令深信至寒冷之時、即可減小義勇軍之積極動作、且易肅清義勇軍之部隊、但是日軍在冬季作戰、亦非常困難、因士兵未受嚴寒之習慣也、日本因有此種嚴重情勢之關係、而將進攻熱河之問題、暫時停帶、（未完）</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚多男子  瞻廬　　多妻主義的帝王，往往生有數十個兒子，這是不足爲奇的：朱明的洪武帝，滿清的康熙帝，都有數十個兒子，只是並非一母所生。　　生有多子，又都是一母所生的；康熙年間，有一位姓鄭的書奶奶，生有三十六子。近來英國有一位麻李司夫人，生有子孫一百六十九人。　　康熙中，江南某太守的書鄭某，每日應卯，總是衣衫襤褸，太守爲着　辦事幹練，賞給很厚；是是，他的衣服，破敝如舊。太守疑他裝窮，向他詰問；他說，小有子三十六人，家累太重，以致衣食不繼，太守笑道：你納寵太多了。他說：小只有一妻，自從十八歳完娶，一年一胎，每胎雙生；今年三十六歳，有子三十六人。太守吩咐喚來察看，他便挈領三十六子登堂，大的抱小的，中的携幼的，霎時擁擠不堪。太守大笑，便厚給鄭某贍家贊：又替他申報上司，各有津貼。這事載於堅觚集。　　西報載英國斯况西地方，有一位麻李司夫人，今年九十八歳：在伊設帨做壽的一天，子孫都來祝嘏：有子一十四人，孫五十五人，曾孫九十九人，恰才六個月的玄孫一人，總數一百六十九人，完全都是伊一脈所傳的；一中，一西，一古，一今，這兩個婦人，都値得令人驚異不止。　　假使個個婦女，都像了這兩位子孫太太；那麽地球上要安挿這許多小國民，除非地球也會懷孕，從一個地球生出幾百個地球，才行。蚯蚓與皮球  竹君　　丨兩個痛心的比喻丨　　有人說，中國人好比是一條蚯蚓，如果有一個人好比是一條蚯蚓，向它身上一刺，它立刻會用力地把身體收縮起來，作一度掙扎，丨丨不能說抵抗。等到小孩的天良發現，把針拔去時，它立刻會忘記了針所賜予它的創痛而恢復了原狀，雖然針疤上還在起着微痛。等到小孩的針第二度的光顧到它身上，它也就再把身體收縮起來，忍着痛，再作一度的掙扎。但是，只要針頭離去它的肉體，它還是立刻會忘記了所有的苦楚而呈露了原來的狀態的。如此一刺一縮，一縮一刺，小孩是覺得非常有趣，而在被侵害的蚯蚓也認爲是家常便飯不足以爲恥辱。可是如果這惡作劇的小孩始終不覺悟到這行爲的殘酷而不斷的刺了拔，拔了刺時，那末，它的肉體會起一種麻木作用，而感不到苦楚的。結果，不消說是會伏伏貼貼的死亡在小孩的手裏。　　又有人說，中國人好比是一個皮球。起初，初面的空氣非常充足，如果有人把它拍一下，它就會猛烈地跳起來，以表示出它的生存力的堅强。拍得愈重，跳得愈高。但如果經了人們過多的蹂躪而走了氣時，它就奄奄地睡倒在地上，不會再起反應，縱然你用力地拍它。於是，人們便可放心地把它剪開來綴補鞋子。　　這兩個痛心的譬喻，當然我不願意信任，但所有的事實，却不清楚地在證實着，我還有什麽話好說呢？姐夫  中言　　丨膠東戰事抬零丨　　北方軍人多山東曹州籍，怒時駡人則呼「舅子」或「小舅子」，猶需人脫口而出之「他媽的」。所謂「舅子」，卽「内弟」之謂，姐夫之對稱也。　　膠東戰時初起時，福山境内劉珍年部駐軍，有一軍官揹脚踏車行於途，爲一鄉人誤撞；軍官盛怒之下，欲賞以耳光，鄉人大懼，口呼「姐夫」不已；軍官訝而詢其故，對曰：「我即不呼汝爲姐夫，汝亦必呼我爲舅子。」此時行人大集，軍官而赮而去，此亦膠東戰事方殷中之一段笑料也。咬菜根  茸餘　　咬得菜根則百事可做丨　　退隱的馮煥章先生，他身穿粗布，口咬硬饝，多麽的儉樸呀！可是有許多人詆他矯揉造作，我想便算他老先生是虛僞的：不合時宜的，但是在這奢侈的社會中，不穿舶來品：肯「以身作則」的做，那是很令人佩服的。　　在都市中，食用不奢侈，便不能顯現他的闊綽。在吃的一項上，一飯百金，更是平常而又没希罕的事。所以有人說道：「富家一席酒，窮漢半年糧。」眞是　些都不形容。　　講到吃的原則，無非免除飢餓，補充體力，要知足你的食慾，是不可能的。古人有句話說道：「食色性也。」一個單身獨漢，他希望取一個妻子，等到有了黃臉婆子，又希望如花如玉的美人兒了　吃也是這様，有了菜荳，希望魚肉，吃了魚肉，又要希望山珍海錯了。這様的貪吃無饜，還是咬咬菜根，倒也苦中得樂。　　咬菜根有甚麽益處呢？照衛生家說蔬菜能清澄血液，而且很富滋養料。照宗敎家說蔬食可以戒除殺生，惜福延年。我們這兩層丢開了不說。藤上摘了斗大的瓜，田中掘了時鮮的菜，只要烹煑合法，風味也不在魚肉之下，何必吃魚嚼肉，方算口福呢　　鄉間的人，他們是咬慣菜根的。非有大客人來：非逢時値節，輕容易没有魚肉進門。可是他們的身體，何等的堅强；他們的血色，何等的充滿，這便可見咬菜根的功效了。都市的人們！勸你們咬咬菜根吧！到底比樹根的滋味好得多咧。　　我曾記得幾句詩道：「大烹荳腐瓜茄葉。」「酒熟蕪菁肥。」咬菜根也自有樂趣，可於這兩句詩上看得出。「咬得菜根，則百事可做。」雖是道學先生的勗勉語！我們也不妨去嘗試嘗試。敎員的人生哲學  睡蓮　　丨從經騐中得來丨　　費盡了幾何心血，拜見幾何友朋，好容易總算找得一個噉飯處，那未你又該計書着如何保守這個金鑄的飯碗而勿使失却呢丨這裏有幾個訣，請看：　　（一）對校長　當入校之初，校長當然和你談談他辦學的方針，你只好洗耳恭聽，他若問起你從前所任學校的内容，那末你不可盡量道出，切忌言及經濟方面，　　（二）對同事　你不該興風作浪的提倡什麽新式敎育法，什麽會；等等，雖然這些事於校長是歡迎的，但是同事們要苦了，又不免遭同事們的怨恨。　　（三）對學生　和學生談話，多引用外國領，那末學生看你的肚子就很神秘了。　　（四）其他　你對他人（最好學生家長）說話，應掉着生花之舌說：「我們學生的程度很高，出去投考没一個不招取的。」同時舉出幾個例來。以證其實。　　明乎此者，跑到中國的敎育界去混混，便都合得上來，且有一個「好敎員」的雅號會贈送給你。死之岔道（三）  　范烟橋　　　三嬸只是笑。　　劉婆子很迫切的說：「我正要和你商量這鬼丫頭只吃飯，不做事，現在的年頭，總不是件事兒，不如給人家去使喚，旣省了一日三餐，又賺了幾塊錢，多少也見些世面，學些規矩。」　　「好的！……說起這件事，前天蘇州城裏十全街韓家二少奶託人寄口信來說：要一個原戶頭年紀輕些身子乾凈些手脚直落些做上房打雜的。三嬸嬸一口氣背履歷似的說了一事出來，頓了一頓，接着說：「像你家愛姑，倒很夠得上，只怕：」　　劉婆子不等伊說完，搶上去說：「那是再好也没有了，請你薦一薦罷，我們的南瓜長足了，過一天，送兩個頂大的來，不過有一句要緊話，工錢不要給伊，我每月到城裏去拿，鬼丫頭有了錢，香粉，花露水，洋襪，裝得七妖八怪，將來連丈夫都不認得了，城裏的娘姨大姐，那一個不如此，這是我的好意，做了幾年還來，私房錢積起來，全手鐲兌不成，銀戒指也戴一隻玩玩。」　　三嬸嬸微微一笑，點點頭。　　「你幾時進城去？就替伊去說說。」劉妻子恐怕伊不經意，再找足一句。　　「今天没有航船了，明天後村有佛會，後天上方山燒香，宿山一夜，大後天晚上還來，已是十四了，十五又要打大蕩裏去看香頭，……」三嬸嬸一壁扳指頭，一壁說，没有說完，又給劉婆子搶住了說：「大蕩裏離葑門近了，就在十五那天帶伊去罷。」　　「不能像霹靂火般性急的，十五那天，是没有功夫的，十八城裏有佛會，我先去說妥了，再伴伊去上工，說不定他家已有了人了，或是眼光不對呢。三嬸嬸故意慢吞吞的說，有條不紊的話，表示伊對於這些事的經騐。　　劉婆子立起來，雙手全合十，「謝天謝地，謝謝三嬸嬸。」三嬸嬸想不出用怎様的禮節去還答伊，只好把手拍着劉婆子的肩胛，不住說着「哎…哎！」意思是謙遜，不敢受領這過量的「口惠而實不至」的感謝。　　　　…………………………………………………………　　小丈夫阿根，在曉色蒼茫裏，在母親劉婆子監視下，提了一個小衣包，送他的未婚而已嫁的妻子愛姑到湖邊去守候從木凟來的航船。他的心上，打翻了五味瓶，也分别不出是喜怒哀樂愛惡懼？三嬸嬸只是向愛姑絮絮地指授到城裏去的一切「經絡」，直到航船來了，快要把三嬸嬸和愛姑帶走的一刹那間，阿根乘授給小衣包的當兒，鼓足了勇氣，低低的問一聲，「幾時回來」愛姑要想安慰他一句，已來不及了，早給劉婆子在背上推着，三嬸嬸在臂上拉着，烟水糢糊，湖邊照夢，一回兒什麽都没有了。</p>

<p>談言揭痛瘡　佛　　丨處世藝術之一丨　　「揭痛瘡，」原是最難過的一件事，因爲瘡旣疼痛，又要揭穿他，豈非痛上加痛，譬如一個人做了不名譽的事，傍人偏要去揭破他，最爲難過，最爲痛恨，　　假定一個婦人，做了不端的事，倘與這個婦人談話，對於這類事情，須要避免，不去談他，因爲一談到這類事情，就要打動她的心弦，或者她原要說是故意譏誚她諷刺她，所以對於奸淫的事情，不談最妙，　　假定一個人是犯罪過的，或曾經親嘗過鐵穿風味的，則對於「監犯」「囚徒」等話，須在少說，因爲他曾經嘗過鐵窗風味，則對於此事，最爲痛心，惹你偏要說這一類的話，或者無心說出，他也以你爲有意來揶揄，所以對於犯罪的事，也不談爲妙，　　以上所說的，不過兩個例子，若推而廣之，則任何一種不應該做事，他去做了，則你對於這種事情，也須留心，如「廢法亂紀」「妄作妄爲」的話，也須少話，假定這人貪生偷死，應當做的事情，他偏不敢去做，則「膽小如鼷」「寡廉鮮恥」的一類話，亦不可多談，　　或者說，他旣經做了這様事情，或不做這様事情，他一定不以爲恥，不以爲羞而做的，或不做的，說也無妨，但是「羞惡之心人皆有之，是非之心人皆有之，」起初他不以爲當做而不做，或不當做而做，若一經人道破，自會「老羞成怒」「强詞奪理」若你再要去說破他，就是所謂「揭痛瘡」一定要碰他的頂子，这就是處世藝術的一種，　　你若能懂得這様的處世藝術，我敢說無投不利了，假定你「不識相」偏要去「揭痛瘡」他天然對於你的批評，無法反對。但是必定要找出别種題目來尋着你呢，文藝秋殘患深泫然賦此　　和吕夢蕉君原韻　　邦人仍未醒南柯，依舊狼烟北地多，祇恐長城傳檄急，劇憐壯士劍空磨，（聞南省投軍者不能向某地通過）　　三分漢鼎存遺憾，七日秦庭感淚沱，海外星軺苦奔走，同情孰肯送秋波，哀國難　馮尙端　　野哭蒼生國難傷，忠魂熱血儘伊凉，覆巢碎卵言雖在，同室操戈利未忘，絕塞笳聲驚怨雁，空閨鬼影泣寒螿，北門雨雪詩人感，墨竭筆枯賦恨長，（却酬）</p>

<p>科學麥精的製造法　吕子偉　　麥精即俗稱的飴糖，是麥和米黍的精粹，味甜可口，極合於冬季的滋補，老人常服牠，可以使皮膚滋潤，且有消痰益氣的妙功。現在藥劑師，用牠來調和其牠的藥味，使甜美適口，像麥精魚肝油，和國温州出品的燕牌牛乳，北平的人參膏，都是牠來調味，一方面使病人容易吃下，一方面生出别種奇妙的功用。　　（甲）製造麥精的事前整備　先把上好的大麥洗凈，用温水把牠放在大的籮内，使牠慢慢出芽，等到長得有三四分長，就把牠放在大鍋内用很强的火去煑熟，使牠成爲麥糊。同時把糯米，（煑熟的），混合在一起，放在很大的缸中，使牠漸漸發酵。　　（乙）製麥精時的手續　旣把麥糊同熟糯米飯，放在一起，當把那只大缸放在暖室内，使牠易於釀成，因爲普通製造麥精和銷路最大的時候，要算冬季和秋季的末期，那時老大的西北風和冽寒的天氣，不得不用人工方法合牠速成了！　　（丙）麥精將釀成的現象　放在缸内有四五天的光景，麥糊同糯米飯已是成爲漿狀，起着很多的小氣泡在面上，就是顯明那麥精成熟的現象，再停一二天的時候，就變成有很好的香味，和醇厚的甜味，那時不妨把牠放别的器皿内，以供顧客的購買。　　（丁）麥精底用途，麥精用途很廣，就是除了醫藥用途外，尚有製造糖菓的原料：什麽芝蔴糖，長生糖酥，糖松子肉，及一切的蜜餞的東西，都把牠做原料，再加些别的香料就成，比用蜜糖要省得多，而且功效很大呀！改良社會討論會奴婢問題　曉雪　　養婢，蓄奴，雇僕的歷史，悠久得幾乎不可稽考：推究其來源，皆因社會上階級高低的關係，與民族間智識武力的强弱關係罷了！　　昔時羅馬戰勝他國，把戰敗的俘虜，作爲奴隸，要當馬騎只好蹲下，甚至於放在鬥獸塲裏與獅子，老虎，黃牛作性命的有角力，以博觀衆的娱樂。這種殘酷性二十世紀雖然没有了，然而文明都市裏依然存留！這種殘酷，雖然在精神文明古老的中國没有，然而比這種表面上文明，實際上更殘酷的依然蔓延，這就是藉着道德慈善的富翁階級，表現尤力。他們拿錢把貧家女孩（或男孩）以最低價格買進，養大後以作他們的用途。（而且富翁以爲是不買要致餓死的。）　　養婢蓄奴的目的，及用作之一法，就是以最低的代價供其無限止的差遣；二：以最低的代價買其一生全部的自由及勞力；至於婢女養大了，其用途之妙，思維之精，世無堪匹丨第　妙法：以最低之代價做他們丨富者丨的安全的洩慾器：第二妙法以最低之代價，故「不孝有三無後爲大一的生殖機。這種事實屢載報紙，並非我杜撰。　　這種殘酷得比與獅虎角力更甚的妙用，實在有根本剷除的必要。　　然而我們靠高聲疾呼「解放奴婢！」靠法律實行嚴辦蓄奴婢者就行嗎　　解放了奴婢，就　替他們想生路。否則女的流爲娼妓，男的流爲匪棍，因爲他們除奴隸工作外，不會做别事，只好做這種。　　美國爲解放黑奴，爲愛平等自由而戰爭的林肯，黑奴非惟不感謝他，反而恨他，說：「林肯把他們麵面搶去了！」以致黑奴仍懇求主人收留他，這大原因，就是解放後没有善後的辦法：　　解放後，應該先由民衆敎育館負責，給以相當之智識，生活費由所謂道德慈善家負擔，第二步給以相當之手藝，使能生活獨立。（然而在現在的狀况中，只好先解放自由，再謀生活的解决，如做茶役招待之類。）　　以上所述自知缺點很多，然而這是很重要的間題，尚望社會人士及記者，提出討論討論！家庭問題我的芳隣　運　　我的芳隣其新先生，娶了大小兩個老婆，可是因此他們間的吵架，却是無日或歇的，下面寫的是他第一天和小老婆綠雲回來的故事。　　門呀的一聲開了，青色的月光照進暗黑的夾弄裏來，他們輕輕地跑了進去，到得客堂裏，靜悄悄的没有一個人影，祗有一盞洋油燈放在檯上，發出黯淡的光綫，裏面傳出孩子的哭聲來。　　「保貞睡了嗎？」　　「我當你死在外面的了，你到還要回轉來？」裏面發出憤怒而詈駡的聲音。　　「才回來，怎麽這様子不客氣的。你這賤女人，其新先生也不免憤憤然了。　　一個女人的兇惡的圓臉在門口閃出來了，挾着憤怒而又凄然的神氣，睜着一雙大黑眼珠，怒目的看着他們倆。　　「她是誰？誰聽你領她回來的？我這屋裏可容不了别一位太太的，老實的告訴你，聽到了没有？」這女人高聲地呼喊着，好像要吃人的様子。　　綠雲可凄然地哭了。　　那女人靠着門口，怒冲冲的立着。其新先生是一個多血質的人，這一下衝動了他的情感，心中的怒火冒得三丈高，禁不住的暴跳如雷，重重的敲着桌子，把一盞洋燈幾乎翻倒下來了，怒喊着：　　「你這賤貨，看我同你干休？啍！我倒没有看見過誰家的妻子是這様的嬌縱的？至於她的來，是我帶她來的，這是我的自由，誰也管不了我。」其新先生怒聲指着她的臉說，眼睛中則似乎要爆出火來了。　　裏面房間裏傳出一陣大而急的孩子的哭聲，中間還夾着喊媽媽的聲音。可是這女人却並不在意，仍舊兀立在門口。　　「管不了你？啍！今晚我便要管管你。看看你娘的手段看。」說完了這話，又旋轉了頭，向着綠雲，厲聲地說道：　　「喂！出去，你這何方來的婆娘，又没有死了你老子，哭什麽？」　　綠雲眼裏落着晶瑩的淚珠，傷心地說道：「出去就出去好了，用不到這麽兇惡的様子，我又不是定要到這地方來的。」於是她恨恨地回轉身子，凄楚地對着其新先生望着，要想跑出去了。　　「綠雲！登在此地，不要跑出去，我自有方法對付她的。」說着，跑到那女人的身邊，「拍」的一聲，在她的背上重重地打了一下，這一下，是引出她的眼淚來了。　　「打人啊！」她大聲地哭着，跑進房裏去了。却還有很大的聲音傳出來。　　「你們合夥兒的來欺侮我，我就領了孩子回去好了。社會一角一個乞丐的供狀　亢石　　在隂雨的前天午後，一陣寒風直刺人們的身上，我不覺慄慄地抖了幾抖，觖然；一個乞丐走進了店中，那乞丐只衣單薄的短衫，哀求地告訴！請予援助！我覺着那乞丐的言語，其中有一段也是社會的黑幕，所以把他赤裸裸地寫在下面。　　下面就是那乞丐的供狀：　　我從前是工江灣××會館中服務，薪水雖然很薄，但是一家數口，也可安然活命，不料一二八倭寇侵滬，從戰區逃了出來，寄宿友人處，不幸家人害了好幾次病，在這貴族化的上海，醫藥金是怎様的高昻，所以把數年積蓄的百餘塊錢，統統化耗在醫藥金上，唉丨可憐不可憐丨那乞丐唏嘘地說着，隔了一會兒，又接續着說：　　現在；雖然敵軍已撤，可是；我因此被僱主裁掉，在這百業凋零的時代，當然：打不到一件職業，然而；坐吃那裏有錢來開銷，自己一人還可過去，何奈一家數口牽累着，所以在虹口××路上設了一個牛肉攤，生涯尚有可觀，不料被當地的白相人偵知，問我可有老頭子？唉！我是一個遭難的弱者，不知道此中奥妙，我對那白相人說，没有老頭子，從此天天有白相人來尋事，弄得不安起來，並且；有一個月裏，總有幾張白相人打秋風的紅帖子發來，假使不送禮的話，這個牛肉攤，當然；要翻身，像這様，擾不勝擾，把幾個本錢都吃完蝕完，唉！爲着飢寒的降迫，自殺麽？還有一家大小數口，所以不得已出來做强顔的乞丐，請諸位賜給兩角錢救助一下！　　那乞乞說完了這了些話，歎息不止，臉上罩了一層苦容，多麽的悲戚！我拿了一角錢給那乞丐，才拜謝地去了，我把那乞丐的共狀，重複地一想，恐怕没有這件事吧？然而；或者也許有這件事？所以深替他可憐，並且；在可憐中發出了可恨，可恨那些白相人不事正業，藉端敲詐，弄得做小生意的無噉飯之地，做乞丐，流盜賊，消極的，或者去自殺，唉！一切都是社會的不幸丨當軸應當芟除纔是！前樓二東的夫婦打架　島生　　正當上午十一時那時光，家家都在預備煑飯燒菜的工作，而前樓裏的二房東夫婦倆却在大打特打，鬧得天翻地覆　　那時，我一個人正在屋子裏沉思，所以聽得非常清楚。最初，夫婦倆在底下灶披問裏嘰咕，中間還夾有第三者的口吻。後來似乎那個第三者走了，夫婦倆就一頭駡，一頭走上扶梯，到了前樓後，彼此駡的聲音逐漸的加高。後來便扭作一團的撕打，好似女的給男的壓在床上的様兒。不久就分開了，男的站着拍桌子，嘴裏駡着：「打死你……」打死你這娼婦……」女的不時把雙足蹬着樓板，「千刀萬剮」的駡着。一回兒，又扭作一團了，女人便哭中加駡了，樓板被蹬得整天價的響。這時，驚動了客堂間裏的陳大婦，隔壁烟紙店裏的老板娘等五六個女人，她們慌慌張張走進了前樓。二房東依舊在破口大駡：「打死她……非打死她不可……呌她的兄弟來辦我吃官司好了」。女的越發哭得厲害，「千刀萬剮」駡得更加有力。在陳大嫂等做好做夕的相勸後，總算是點效騐，女的隨着陳大嫂等下樓去，男的也便不如非打死她不可那様的氣燄萬丈了。一塲吵架，從此閉幕丨　　我没有去負排難解紛的責任，雖則聽了半天隔壁戲，因何動武的原因却不知道，心裏料想必是爲了重大的事故纔致此。　　飯後，二房東帶着一臉笑容走來，一進門便向我打恭作揖，連聲說：「剛纔驚動先生了」！　　他說：「我欠了一個朋友十多塊錢債，前幾天已還了他幾元，這幾天又催得緊，一天來討兩次以至三次，但我確是没有錢，有什麽辦法呢？今天上午，那個朋友又來了，當在是討錢，我袋裏雖則有幾塊錢，但是吃飯張本，我想來想去，不能把生意本錢付給他。所以求情緩後，一面喚我女人到外面去借錢，「到外面去借」不過一個敷衍辦法，借到借不到由你。而我那笨女人不明白這一層，死也不肯走，逼得我好苦！恨極了，因此，纔打她一頓」！　　聽了這番話後，我似中又氣又好笑，他們原來爲此而打架。同時，又覺得非常可憐。市塲訊　　亨利洋服公司　海上洋服店之巨　，昔爲孫總理所信任，近得王正廷博士贊美之亨利洋服公司，總公司南京路沙遜房子第一支號靜安寺路，二七六號第二支店霞飛路一四○號，第三支號外國青年會，第四支號中國青年會，第五支模西華德路九號，尙有其他支號四處，爲海上規號最大之洋服店，聘請外國優等技師，專制高等洋服，出租男女結婚禮服，禮帽，披紗，頭花，一應俱全，海上行將結婚青年，請勿忘亨利結婚禮服云，　　跳躍二卷七期出版　内有王南陔詞話，程如娟哺兒扎記，李季宏賣肉的吳承達，我的生活，周沛生哭的歷史，曹由之肉街，邵亦羣月經與性交，以及柳葉陳亮天嚼萬選胡爲苦茶等散文，歡迎索閱，附郵一分，連寄二期，社址老北門吳家弄公益社，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Expanding the Monthly Donation Campaign to Aid Northeastern Refugees Sincere <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, people from all walks of life in Shanghai, considering the arduous struggles of the righteous armies in the Northeast awaiting assistance and the urgent need for relief for the thirty million compatriots in the Northeast who are trapped in dire straits, have launched a monthly donation campaign. Its aim is to rescue the dying and heal the wounded. The declaration states: "If a person does not wish to do good, then so be it. But if one wishes to do good, then rescuing the dying and healing the wounded is the greatest act of benevolence. If a person does not wish to serve the country, then so be it. But if one wishes to save the country, then preventing its destruction and the loss of our homes is the ultimate way to serve the country." The words are deeply felt, and the tone is particularly passionate. We believe that if our countrymen have not yet forgotten the thirty million compatriots in the Northeast and the half of our nation's territory under the tyrannical rule of the Japanese, then they should respond to this monthly donation campaign promptly and join forces to help expand it.</p>
<p>Ever since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident last year, the Northeast has fallen under the violent grip of the Japanese. More than a year has passed since then, leading to the open staging of the puppet regime. Japan has also officially recognized the puppet regime, while our entire country is reveling in pleasure and luxury, just as before. It is like the merchants' daughters who do not know the sorrow of a fallen nation, like swallows nesting in curtains unaware of the danger. Only the righteous armies in the Northeast have spontaneously risen up to recover the lost territory, to fight for the dignity of our nation. They have consistently waged arduous and prolonged battles with the powerful enemy with unwavering perseverance. Their tragic blood has been shed across the broken land. Their loyalty and heroism are truly enough to move gods and spirits and shake the heavens and the earth. As for the thirty million compatriots in the Northeast, their homes were destroyed before the nation fell, and they were enslaved before the race was exterminated. They are struggling under the iron heel of the Japanese, writhing in agony, and have no way to appeal. Now, this year, the great flood in Harbin has caused a disaster, and the number of people displaced and wandering is also very large. The depth of their suffering and the urgency of their need for assistance are conceivable to us. The autumn grass beyond the Great Wall is bleak and the cold wind is harsh. These struggling righteous armies and refugees are now enduring hunger and cold, fighting desperately with the powerful enemy. We are eating and resting peacefully. If we were to disregard these righteous armies and refugees indifferently, like the people of Yue looking at the fat and lean of the people of Qin, without showing any sympathy, it would be fair to say that we have no heart or liver.</p>
<p>However, the reason why we are calling on the people of the country to strive to expand this movement is not primarily to persuade people to do good, nor to plead for the lives of the righteous armies and refugees in the Northeast, hoping to move the "compassion" of "benevolent people." We believe that this movement is a powerful test of the future of our nation's survival. If our nation can still maintain its spirit of national founding, if it has not yet forgotten this major trauma, if it is unwilling to let half of the Northeast's territory be lost in this way, then it should make extra efforts for this movement, and the lost territory in the Northeast will surely have a day of recovery. Our nation's life can certainly last for a long time. Conversely, if the people of the whole country indulge in pleasure and seek only temporary security, if they are unaware of the approaching death and unmoved by the impending disaster, then they will naturally look at this monthly donation campaign with indifference. The nation's vitality will completely disappear, which will prove it. And the darkness of our nation's future is as black as lacquer, and the danger is even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan's invasion of the Northeast has been carefully planned long before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. Under the conspiracy of its active continental policy, it will never be satisfied with seizing the Northeast. In other words, its iron hoofs will never stop at the Northeast. Hanzawa Gyokujo, the chief writer of the Japanese Diplomatic Times, wrote in an article on how Manchuria should be handled: "The last time I was in Fengtian, I said to Colonel Itagaki, a staff officer of the Kwantung Army, 'A child from my relatives' family also entered the Army Cadet School this year. After twenty or twenty-five years, he will also become Colonel Itagaki. For the development of future generations, please leave some work for them.' At first, Itagaki thought I was saying bad things about him. Later, when he understood what I meant, he said, 'What is this? The Manchurian problem is solved by us. Later, there will be the Siberian problem, the Pacific problem, and so on. Is there an end to the work of future generations?'" The implication is already self-evident. The Northeast Incident is like the eruption of a volcano. Once a volcano has erupted, it cannot be extinguished immediately. Therefore, our rescue of the righteous armies and refugees in the Northeast today is, on a large scale, to save our nation, and on a small scale, to save ourselves. The tyranny that the people of the Northeast are suffering today under the ambition of the violent Japanese can come upon our heads at any time. If we must wait until the country is destroyed and our homes are lost before we awaken, it will be too late, and regret will be of no avail.</p>
<p>We speculate that some people in the country may think that we are sincerely willing to make great efforts to rescue the righteous armies and refugees in the Northeast. However, today, our country's social economy is bankrupt, and livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult. We are barely able to take care of ourselves, so how can we have the extra strength to make monthly donations? Their words seem to be true, but in reality, they are not. Today, Japan's rural areas are in decline, and the situation is also very serious. Rural debt has reached 700 million yen, with an average debt of 1,000 yen per household. After the September 18th Incident, Japanese farmers owed 80 million yen in taxes. The poverty of the people's livelihoods can also be imagined. However, since the Northeast Incident, the total amount of private donations for national defense supplies has been 6,282,630 yen. Even if they have no money to donate, they will give everything they have, even a chicken or a pig. If they, for aggression, and their people's donations are so enthusiastic, then we, for self-defense, for rescue, for national salvation, how can we not save on clothing and food, do everything in our power to help the righteous armies and rescue the refugees?</p>
<p>Countrymen, rise up, and strive to expand this monthly donation campaign to aid the righteous armies and refugees. The future of our nation is powerfully tested by this movement.</p>

For example, those attacking Zaojia City are said to be the Fifth Division, but in reality, they only have a thousand or so rifles. Recently, when the bandits are defeated, they often abandon their rifles and flee, unlike before when three or four people shared one rifle and would not retreat even in death. The bandits captured by the Eighteenth Army all have hair several inches long and are covered in dirt, which shows their suffering. Zhu De and Mao Zedong's main forces have all fled east to northern Fujian. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>

The bandit communists in the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Henan have been gradually eliminated under the command of the commander-in-chief. However, the remaining flames of the Jiangxi bandits have reignited, and many places have not yet been recovered. Chiang Kai-shek has decided to go to Jiangxi to personally command the suppression, taking a pincer attack with the Fujian and Guangdong armies. The post-war affairs such as cleaning up the three provinces and promoting good governance at the county level still require senior officials to be stationed. It was previously planned to entrust Liu Zhi, chairman of Henan province, with responsibility. However, because Henan's military and political affairs are very busy, it is difficult to take care of both.

This is because Chiang Kai-shek said that as long as there is a way to control the Yellow River, funds can be raised. The results of this inspection show that controlling the Yellow River is not impossible. The most important things are (1) dredging the mouth of the sea, (2) narrowing the river channel in Henan province, and (3) digging the Wushu Mountain to prevent the Tao River from flowing north into the Yellow River and south into the Wei River.

<h3 id="e60">No Matter the Change of the Next President, US Policy Toward the Far East Will Not Change <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Maintain the Open Door Policy and Preserve the Territorial Integrity of China</p>
<p>Naval Policy Will Shift with the Progress of the Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 1st: With the primary election period for the US presidential election only a week away, according to responsible sources here, regardless of the outcome of the primary election, the US policy toward the Far East seems likely to remain unchanged. Whether the next government belongs to the Republican or Democratic Party, it is expected to adhere to the traditional Pacific policy, namely the sanctity of treaties, the open door for trade, and the territorial integrity of China. Moreover, the current US policy toward Manchuria is a strictly government policy and has never involved party views. Therefore, during the previous session of Congress, influential senators and representatives of both the Republican and Democratic parties did not severely criticize it. Even among the public, it is expected to be generally approved by public opinion. However, the effectiveness of the current policy is entirely dependent on public opinion. Some people here believe that if the government changes, the public's reaction to the Manchurian situation may be expressed in new ways. This is because President Hoover and Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, both obstructed the public's inclination to boycott Japanese goods. It is not known whether a new sentiment of non-official boycott of Japanese goods will re-emerge among the people once the person in charge of diplomacy changes. As for trade, the change of government will naturally bring new hopes for increasing Pacific trade. However, tariff revisions will have little impact on the entire Far East trade, because the United States does not tax many important products from the Far East. Even for agricultural products, if the Democratic Party revises tariffs, it will not raise them. Both the Republican and Democratic parties are eager to support silver prices and find ways to raise them in order to benefit the ten western silver-producing states in the United States. However, although China is on a silver standard, according to experts here, the Chinese only hope for the stability of the remaining price. As for military spending, regardless of whether the Republican or Democratic Party is in power, they are expected to continue to work to limit armaments. However, in the coming years, the United States may be seen carefully discussing its naval policy. However, this matter must shift with the results of the arms reduction conference and the future progress of the Manchurian dispute. As for island policies, the two parties have very different opinions, which will have repercussions on Far East relations. The Democratic Party platform advocates the independence of the Philippines, while the Republican Party platform does not mention it. The Republican Party platform states that the method of governing Hawaii remains as before. Although the Democratic Party platform does not explicitly state it, William, the leader of the party, proposed a case when he was chairman of the House Territorial Committee in the previous Congress, advocating major reforms in the legislative system of Hawaii and suppressing the power of Japanese residents.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 1st: The US presidential election campaign is now intensifying. Hoover and Roosevelt are campaigning everywhere, hoping to influence the views of voters. However, according to various signs, Roosevelt seems to have a better chance of winning. In betting on the election results, Roosevelt has a three-to-one advantage. However, the Republican Party remains confident that Hoover can be re-elected as president. Personally, Hoover, as the incumbent president, can slightly gain an advantage. However, Roosevelt's demeanor is also enough to make voters admire him. Roosevelt is a relative of the late President Roosevelt. Politically, there are no significant differences between the policies of the two parties. They have similar views on import tariffs, except that the Democratic Party attacks the current tariffs as too high. The people of the United States suffer, and the financial difficulties are all attributed to President Hoover. Whether this accusation is appropriate or not, it is enough to make voters lean to the other side and give them the opportunity to clarify the situation.</p>

<p>Regardless of Accommodating Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 1st: The League of Nations Council has postponed the date for considering the Lytton Report to November 21st because Japan's written opinion arrived late. Therefore, the Special Committee of Nineteen will not reconvene until early December. The League of Nations special conference will also have to be postponed to early next year.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd: The Japanese government is very pleased that the League of Nations Council has postponed the meeting to consider the Lytton Report. This is because Ambassador Yoshida, who is stationed in Turkey and carries Japan's written opinion on the Lytton Report, will not be able to reach Geneva until November 16th.</p>
<p>And Japan will need to modify its opinion if it deems it necessary.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: Lord Ponsonby, a former member of the Labour government, will mention the issue of the Lytton Report in the House of Lords this afternoon. He will ask whether the Chinese National Government intends to urge early consideration of the Lytton Report and what attitude the British government takes towards the conclusions of the Investigation Mission.</p>

<p>Factories Rush to Manufacture Military Explosives</p>
<p>Osaka Dispatch from the China United News Agency: Since explosives are the most important supplies for future wars, we will briefly record how the Japanese imperialists are expanding their gunpowder factories. The Japanese Army Ministry has built ten gunpowder factory branches near Tadaumi in Hiroshima Prefecture. The necessary machinery has been formally contracted with the Japan Foundry Company. At the same time, the Iwahana, Oji, and Ryokuyo gunpowder factories also plan to increase the number of poly-star nitric acid suction machines, and are also trading with the Japan Foundry Company. In the naval field, in order to meet the demand for eight hundred explosives, a temporary contract has been established with the Imperial Explosives Company. As a result, the Imperial Explosives Company is extremely busy, renovating the strong guncotton nitration, smokeless gunpowder drying and airing, solvent recovery, and other major factories. Because the Navy Ministry forcibly ordered the urgent production of military chemicals, the Maizuru Explosives Department ordered work day and night, causing an explosion due to overheating of sulfuric acid raw materials, killing and injuring seventeen workers on the spot. Not long ago, a private factory also used five million yuan of Yazaku Hydroelectric Power Company funds to establish a nitric acid plant in Nagoya Atsuta. The Fukushima Genta factories in fertile Japan have also received secret orders from the military to manufacture poison gas and perchloric ammonia chemicals. Other projects such as the aerial nitrogen fixation project (ammonium sulfate factory) are also increasing production and improving explosive products. The above examples clearly show how urgent the second imperialist war is.</p>

A portion of the cabinet meeting tomorrow will still be used to study the disarmament issue. Some important people believe that the cabinet's opinion on the disarmament issue, since the recent incident, is how. It is thought that the authorities will publish all of them in the next few days. However, this news is from unofficial sources, and we should be cautious about it. However, it is undoubtedly true that the British government is paying attention to the disarmament issue.</p>
<h3 id="e67">France and Spain Sign Three Agreements <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Labor Issues</p>
<p>Demonstration Against the Spanish Youth Party</p>
<p>Herriot Unhappy</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 1st: Since French Prime Minister Herriot arrived in the Spanish capital, one of the most important things has been the signing of three agreements between France and Spain today, all concerning the employment and dismissal of workers and the entry and exit of immigrants between France and Spain. The signatories were Spanish Labor Minister Caballero and French Labor Minister Damille. Tonight, Herriot hosted a banquet at the French Embassy to entertain Spanish Prime Minister Azana and others, and both sides praised each other and were very harmonious.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 2nd: Premier Herriot's visit to Spain is aimed at consolidating relations between France and Spain. However, when he arrived here on Sunday, he encountered hostile demonstrations. Prime Minister Liang Herriot was displeased. The disturbance was caused by rumors that the French Prime Minister's visit was related to a military contract between the two countries. Today, when the French Prime Minister spoke of the disturbance, he said, "I am providing the most advanced methods of peace education to Europe, but a small part of the Spanish Youth Party thinks that I am here to prepare for war, which makes me feel like a thief who wants to steal the country." Some important people in Spain have a different attitude. They welcome Herriot's visit and believe that it is enough to consolidate the ties between the oldest and the newest republics.</p>
<p>Havas, Madrid, 1st: At noon today, Spanish President Zamora hosted a banquet for French Prime Minister Herriot. Spanish readers had many personal relationships with Herriot, and they had a very pleasant conversation. The meeting between the authorities of the two countries made the relationship between the two republics, which share common interests, even closer. After the banquet, they visited the Prado Museum for the second time, and then received representatives of the French press in Spain. Herriot first expressed his gratitude for the hospitality of the Spanish authorities, and then said that the French attitude has been misrepresented by outsiders. It is appropriate to ask the Spanish press to correct it with a critical eye.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 2nd: Polish Minister Chai Lesky resigned today and was succeeded by Vice Minister Peck. Chai has been the Foreign Minister for seven years. It is said that he has been ill for many years and cannot bear the heavy burden. He has wanted to resign for a long time. Because he wanted to see Poland re-elected as a country and an executive council member, he has now resigned. His successor, Peck, was the Vice Minister of the Army and has long been trusted by Piłsudski.</p>

<p>The Preparatory Committee Discusses the Gold Standard</p>
<p>France, the United States, and Belgium Oppose the British Plan</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 1st: The experts of the preparatory committee of the World Economic Conference gathered here this morning to discuss the gold standard. British representative Philip spoke the most, saying that the rise in prices and the removal of trade barriers are two necessary prerequisites for currency equalization. Mr. Fei also read a section of the Ottawa Agreement to explain the British plan, but the British representative's views were strongly opposed by the representatives of France, Belgium, and the United States. They all believed that Britain's abandonment of the full gold standard forced neighboring countries to increase their tariff barriers.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 1st: When the Economic Subcommittee of the Preparatory Committee of the World Economic Conference met, French representative Subei declared that there were three policies that France could choose from: raising tariffs, abolishing promises on international contracts (i.e., commercial treaties), and opening the border to allow its own producers to be trapped. However, France ultimately adopted the method of quantity restriction, because in terms of France and those who trade with France, we believe that the harm of this method is the lightest.</p>

<p>The British Parliament Discusses Boycott Methods</p>
<p>British Trade with Russia Continues to be Maintained</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st: In the Lower House tonight, a Conservative MP showed samples of Japanese white silk and colored silk, saying that Japanese goods were being dumped in British territories. Stricter measures should be taken than those stipulated in the Ottawa Agreement to stop the dumping of Japanese silk. The reasons are as follows: (1) Japanese workers work 60 hours a week and only get 7 shillings and 3 pence in wages, while the UK has to pay 35 shillings for 48 hours a week. (2) The Japanese government guarantees bad debts. (3) The Japanese imitate English goods. The silk he showed is sold for only 30 to 35 shillings per yard, while the same English silk costs 56 shillings per yard and has no profit. English factories producing this silk are gradually closing down. If the government does not remedy it quickly, this industry will soon disappear.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st: The two Houses of Parliament debated the issue of trade with Russia this evening. Some people in the Upper House proposed that trade with Russia should not be resumed until Russia repays its debts. Government representatives opposed this proposal, saying that British trade with Russia has increased from 2 million pounds in 1928 to 7 million pounds last year. If this trade is stopped, it will increase unemployment in the UK and will not make Russia pay its debts. This proposal was later withdrawn.</p>

<p>Police Exert All Efforts to Suppress the Riot</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 1st: Representatives of the unemployed people outside the British capital wanted to petition the Lower House of Parliament to abolish the livelihood investigation system (i.e., asset measurement), which led to disturbances in a large area of London today. Thousands of unemployed people in the capital suddenly gathered and demonstrated. The police initially failed to cope with the situation, and then tried to separate the demonstrators into more than a dozen sections and suppress them separately. When the demonstrators' momentum gradually weakened, they surrounded them again, and finally restored order in two hours. The representatives of the unemployed people outside the capital tried to separate themselves from the demonstrators from beginning to end. They told people afterwards that they would continue to adopt a policy of passive resistance and carry out orderly demonstrations and publicity, so as to express their grievances to the authorities and achieve the purpose of petitioning. According to reports, today's demonstration was held in Westminster. Representatives from outside the capital and unemployed people in the capital filled the streets. The more people gathered, the more crowded it became. The police saw that it would be difficult to control the situation, so they began to expel them. As a result, small conflicts occurred in Whitehall, Strand, and Trafalgar Square. Many shop windows were destroyed. On the Victoria Embankment, the public destroyed streetcars and overturned cars. Mounted police and foot police repeatedly suppressed them, and expelled them until about 11:00 in the evening. Except for a few places where there were still small conflicts, the city was generally back to normal. More than 20 demonstrators were arrested, and many people were slightly injured. Several policemen were also hit by stones, but no one on either side was seriously injured. During the disturbance, the police always prevented the public from reaching the Parliament.</p>

<p>The Market Is Weak and Financial Turnover Is Unstable</p>
<p>The Governor Borrows Money from Washington for Relief</p>
<p>National News Agency, Reno, 1st: Nevada, USA, announced today that it will temporarily suspend payments in the state for two weeks. Twenty-one of the twenty-five state banks have been ordered to suspend business. In a subsequent announcement, they will be temporarily managed by State Bank Auditor Wenfield. (According to the United States, there are national banks, state banks, and city banks, depending on the scope of their business.) Currently, Governor Barchai is in Washington, hoping to borrow a large sum of money from the Financial Relief Department to relieve the financial community in the state. According to the recent cause of this financial trend, due to the fall in livestock prices, the consumption of meat in the summer months has been reduced, and the price has plummeted. Although consumption has increased recently, the price of meat has not increased. As a result, the money borrowed by various livestock industries from banks has become bad debts, and the financial community feels that the turnover is not working. Now that the Governor has gone to Washington and the Deputy Governor Griswold has announced the temporary suspension of payments, the financial situation has become even worse. All banks that have not suspended business have followed the temporary suspension of payments regulations, restricting business, only handling check accounts and daily business, neither lending nor forcibly unwinding. The financial community has lost its turnover effectiveness. Nevada's resources are mainly based on mining, animal husbandry, tourism, and divorce cases. Now that the price of silver has plummeted, the number of tourists and divorce cases has also decreased sharply. Coupled with the stagnation of the animal husbandry industry, one of the states with the greatest civil wealth in the United States has also suffered this major blow. The state has a population of less than 92,000, and the average wealth per person is 6,318 yuan.</p>

<p>The Old Customs of Yugoslavia Should Be Reformed</p>
<p>Havas, Yugoslav Capital, 1st: In Yugoslavia, a house collapsed some time ago, and an old man, 113 years old, was rescued from the rubble and was safe and sound, which was spread as a topic of conversation. Today, an old woman, 124 years old, died, which shows that the spirit of heaven and earth is concentrated in the southern country. Otherwise, how can there be so many people who live to be 100 years old? The old woman's death is worth recording. The old woman was old and weak, and her limbs lost their function. One day, she lay on the head of the bed, and her family suspected that she was dead, so they prepared her for burial. According to the old customs of the place, the youngest member of the family should pierce the abdomen of the deceased with an iron bolt before the burial. Although this custom has been repeatedly prohibited by the authorities, the general public has disobeyed it. After the old woman was buried, her young great-grandson performed the ancient ritual according to the rules. Unexpectedly, the iron bolt hit her abdomen, and the old woman woke up in extreme pain. Afterwards, she died soon due to her old age and weakness and could not bear the pain.</p>

<p>The Korean Army will Withdraw First, and then the Liu Army will Leave Shandong</p>
<p>Gao Lingbai Went to Yantai to Monitor the Actions of the Two Armies</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the conflict between the Korean and Liu armies in Jiaodong, they have been in a stalemate for more than a month, and have not yet been resolved. The Liu army in Yixian City has repeatedly tried to break through and escape due to lack of food, but has been repelled by the Korean army, and its strength has been greatly reduced. Recently, Liu Zhennian himself, who was trapped in the city, is not as stubborn as before, and expressed his willingness to obey the orders of the Central Government. The Liu's troops in Laiyang City also broke out of the city and fled south on the 27th due to lack of goods. When they reached Changzhi Town in the territory of Jimo County, they were quickly detected by Rong Guangxing, the commander of the 87th Brigade of the Korean Army. He immediately telegraphed the Third Route Army Headquarters to ask for a team to intercept them, and ordered his subordinates to be on strict alert to prevent them from fleeing south. The Qinghai garrison, fearing that the defeated soldiers would flee into the city and hinder the security of the city, also urgently dispatched 400 marines to Jimo to deploy. Cooperate in blocking. The next day (28th), the Jin Dianbang Regiment of the 87th Brigade stationed in Gaomi Jiaoxian was ordered to attack. It immediately united with the local militia to surround Changzhi Town. The Liu army resisted slightly, and then raised a white flag, willing to hand over their weapons. It is estimated that more than 300 rifles and more than 30 submachine guns were seized. All captured officers and soldiers were ordered to be given severance pay. It is said that the actual number of Liu's troops in Yixian and Laiyang, in addition to the dead, wounded, and captured, is currently about 14,500. Since Liu Zhennian has expressed his willingness to obey the orders of the Central Government, this matter is easy to handle. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent Zhuang Bocheng, Zhang Fang, and others to Jinan to discuss the mediation method with Han Fuju. Han has fully agreed to withdraw his troops first. The Central Government has also sent Chiang Bocheng, Xiong Bin, and Gao Lingbai thirty as commissioners to monitor the withdrawal of troops from both sides. Chiang Bocheng is in Jinan and is responsible for the Korean side. Gao Lingbai went to Yantai, and Xiong Bin went to Yixian, and was responsible for the Liu side. Mr. Gao took the Jiaoji Road train last night and arrived in Qingdao at 7:30 this morning (31st). Mayor Shen Honglie personally went to the station to welcome him. Currently, Mr. Gao is staying at the Xinmin Hotel. I went to visit Mr. Gao and visited Shen Honglie at the Municipal Government to inquire about the withdrawal of troops from the Korean and Liu armies. The two men talked as follows: (Gao Lingbai's conversation) The Jiaodong issue has been completely resolved. Once the Korean army withdraws its siege, the Liu army will be transferred away from Shandong Province. The location and date of the Liu army's transfer will be ordered by the Central Government and the Ministry of Military Affairs. I was ordered by the Central Government to monitor the actions of the two armies. Because I have long admired Qingdao as a famous commercial port in northern China, and it has been built by the efforts of Hu and Shen, the achievements are obvious. Therefore, I came to Qingdao for a tour, and took the opportunity to discuss with Mayor Shen the issue of the navy taking over Yantai. Zhang Fang, the commander of the 20th Route Army, originally planned to come with me, but there are still unfinished matters in Jinan that need to be dealt with urgently. He will definitely come to Qingdao in a day or two. I will stay in Qingdao for a day or two and will still return to Jinan to discuss with Chiang (Bocheng) and Xiong (Bin) once, and then transfer to Yantai to implement monitoring. (Shen Honglie's conversation) It is a blessing for the local people that the Jiaodong incident can be resolved as soon as possible. The Navy took over Yantai last time because the Liu army withdrew from Yantai and no one was responsible for the local area. Therefore, at the request of the foreign leaders and the local chamber of commerce, they temporarily landed to maintain order. Later, when the Korean army arrived in Yantai, the Navy immediately withdrew to the original ship and handed over the defense area. However, since the Liu army withdrew from Longkou, the Korean army has not sent troops to take over, so the Navy is still responsible for maintaining local security. Currently, the Haichen ship is stationed in Weihai, and the Chuyu ship is in Yantai. All the places are very peaceful. I have not yet received a formal order from the Central Government regarding the Navy taking over Yantai. If the Liu army is transferred by sea, I will send ships to patrol and be responsible for ensuring its safety. (October 31)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Henan Province Requests the Establishment of a National Museum <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The Henan Provincial Government, considering that Henan Province is located in the Central Plains and is the birthplace of Chinese culture, and that in recent years, through the efforts of the Academia Sinica and the Provincial Government, many ancient artifacts have been unearthed, all of which are valuable cultural relics, believes that a national museum should be established in Bian (Kaifeng) to store these unearthed artifacts, and to collect and display flora, fauna, and minerals from across the country for academic reference. A formal petition has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, requesting approval for its establishment. The original petition is as follows: "We respectfully note that the rise and fall of a nation depend on the flourishing and decline of its culture. In order to promote public education and propagate culture, all countries have established museums to supplement the shortcomings of school education and social education. The function of a museum is not only to preserve ancient artifacts and documents, but also to systematically introduce ancient culture, modern natural specimens, and models to the general public, to cultivate their love for the culture of their motherland and their interest and ability to strive for modern civilization. Therefore, museums have a significant impact on social education. The Ministry of Education previously stipulated in its social education program that the government should establish a central museum in the capital and select several important cities to build museums with state funds. This intention is far-sighted and admirable. Henan Province is located in the Central Plains and is the birthplace of Chinese culture. In recent years, many ancient artifacts have been unearthed, which are of great importance. It is indeed necessary to establish a complete museum. We respectfully submit the detailed reasons to your esteemed Yuan: (1) Historical Aspect: China is one of the earliest countries with a culture in the world, and Henan Province is the birthplace of Chinese culture. Since before the Zhao and Song dynasties, all dynasties have established their capitals here. After thousands of years of history, famous places, historical sites, steles, stone carvings, and other ancient relics are found everywhere underground. These items can all be used for the textual research of ancient culture. For example, the oracle bone inscriptions discovered in Anyang in recent years are sufficient to determine the civilization of the Yin and Shang dynasties; the ritual vessels from Xinzheng are sufficient to determine the rites and institutions of the Eastern Zhou dynasty; the statues from Luoyang and Gongyi are sufficient to determine the art of Buddhism during the Northern Wei, Qi, and Tang dynasties; and the pottery from Mianchi is sufficient to determine the social conditions of the Stone Age. These are just the most prominent examples. In other places such as Ji, Hui, Hua, Jun, Xia, Mi, Dengfeng, Yanshi, Mengjin, Nanyang, Tongbai, Xinyang, Xiangcheng, Yanling, and Xihua, ancient artifacts are often discovered. However, due to the lack of well-equipped institutions for preservation and collection, they are often colluded with by a small number of unscrupulous elements who buy them up and take them away, resulting in the loss of treasures left by our ancestors for thousands of years. This is truly regrettable. In view of this, the Provincial Government, in conjunction with the Academia Sinica, established the Henan Antiquities Research Association in the 20th year (of the Republic), which is specifically responsible for the investigation, excavation, and research of ancient artifacts. However, the preservation of ancient artifacts is the responsibility of the Henan Museum, which is small in scale and insufficient for development. This is the first reason for establishing a museum to preserve ancient documents. (2) Geographical Aspect: Henan is located in the Central Plains, directly accessible to the north, south, east, and west via the Longhai and Pinghan railways. Transportation is extremely convenient. Recently, the call for the development of the Northwest has spread throughout the country. If we want to realize the development plan, the first step is to collect and display various products of the Northwest as much as possible, and introduce them to the general public, to arouse their determination to participate in this development work. The only institution that can fulfill this responsibility is the museum. Henan is the first gateway to the Northwest. If Henan has a complete museum, those who are concerned about the Northwest do not need to go to the Northwest in person. They only need to set foot in Henan to understand everything about the Northwest. In his book "Travels of Marco Polo," Marco Polo described the Eastern culture in great detail. Europeans who read it were filled with admiration, which eventually led to the discovery of the Eastern sea route. The descriptions in travelogues are only indirect impressions, but their function is sufficient to promote the successful integration of Chinese and Western cultures. The museum is a direct promotion of facts. When we enter it, our perceptions are subconsciously changed. Its impact is far beyond what travelogues can compare. This is the second reason for establishing a museum to realize the development plan of the Northwest. (3) Production Aspect: Henan is located in the Huai and Yellow River basins, with fertile soil and abundant resources. Due to climate and geographical conditions, all natural products such as flora, fauna, and minerals have a tendency to connect the north and the south. This point is extremely important in natural science and should not be ignored. In recent years, biological research institutes and geological survey institutes have been established in various parts of the north and south. Although Henan also has plans to establish such institutions, the former has only recently been planned and organized by Henan University, and is limited to Baiquan. The latter is also small in scale and insufficient to shoulder this important task. According to the field investigations of general scholars in recent times, new species of fish are often found in Henan that are different from common species. This is truly a major discovery in academia. It is urgent to collect them extensively for comparative research. This is the third reason for establishing a museum to connect the changing relationships of natural products in the north and south. (4) Political Aspect: Finally, from a political perspective, since the establishment of Luoyang as the capital, Henan has become an important town in our country. The number of Chinese and foreigners traveling back and forth has increased many times. The western section of the Longhai Railway is progressing rapidly, and its hub is of great importance. It seems appropriate to strive for perfection in cultural facilities, to give a fresh impression to both Chinese and foreigners. This is the fourth reason for establishing a museum to promote the country. In summary, a complete national museum is urgently needed and has great benefits. If we do not quickly plan to establish one, it will be insufficient to meet the needs of the times. We propose to establish a national museum in the open space near Longting in Kaifeng City, in accordance with the provisions of Item 3, Section 1, Article 5 of the Education Program, to collect flora, fauna, and minerals from across the country, as well as valuable cultural relics, and display them extensively to achieve perfection. The various unearthed items obtained by the Anyang Yin Ruins Excavation Team of the Academia Sinica can be directly stored in the museum after the research is completed and returned to the province, so as to avoid disputes. In the future, all unearthed ancient artifacts in various counties should also be collected extensively and displayed together, so that the cultural relics left by thousands of years can be permanently preserved in Henan, the birthplace of culture. When people of insight from all over the country come to visit and study, they will surely be inspired and excited, and will think of ways to promote and expand them, which will be of great benefit. As for the establishment funds, in accordance with Item 1, Section 1, Article 5 of the Education Program, the construction and operating expenses of museums in important cities should be allocated by the government. In addition, the provisions of Items 6 and 7 of the same article, which stipulate that "the construction and equipment costs of museums in various provinces shall be set at 500,000 yuan," and "the operating expenses of museums in various provinces shall not be less than 50,000 yuan," are proposed to be allocated from the Geng款 (Boxer Indemnity Funds) for application."</p>
<h3 id="e84">Profound Writings of Westerners After Investigating the Northeast <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Civil Servants and Elementary School Teachers All Hold Anti-Japanese Sentiments</p>
<p>The Puppet State Army Especially Unwilling to Fight Against the Righteous Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, various countries have paid close attention to the situation in the Eastern Provinces. Quite a few Europeans and Americans have gone to the area for on-the-spot investigations. A certain military organization in Nanjing recently obtained report data from Westerners Muranch and Weiler, which provided accurate descriptions and profound arguments regarding the situation in the Eastern Provinces. However, due to strict Japanese inspections and circuitous mailing, it took a lot of time. Although some of it is outdated, it shows that although the Northeast has temporarily fallen, there are actually still great opportunities for action, and the current state of the Northeast is greatly detrimental to both Japan and the puppet organizations. The full text of the report data is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The mutiny of the Railway Protection Army at Manchuria Station, that is, armed resistance against Japan and opposition to the puppet Manchurian government, occupying a 260-mile zone along the railway line, put Japan in a very serious situation and made it impossible for them to rescue the Japanese advisors of the "Manchukuo" and some senior officials of the "Manchurian government." They are now trying to ask the Soviet Union to dispatch troops to the vicinity of Manchuria Station to give the Railway Protection Army a major suppression, which is opposed by the commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria and some senior officers. They believe that the mutiny of the Railway Protection Army must be secretly supported by the Soviet Union, otherwise it could not be so fierce, so they must find a way to resist. However, these negotiations have not yet been effective. In short, the situation in Manchuria is very serious for Japan, and there is a feeling of disagreement from all sides. Not only do the Japanese army commander and the "Manchurian army" commander disagree, but the commanders of the various Japanese army units also hold different opinions. In early August and September of this year, a large part of the cavalry was transferred from Japan to Manchuria. (According to the information obtained, there are about two brigades of cavalry, one of which is the 4th Cavalry Brigade, and the other brigade's number is unknown.) After the cavalry arrived in Manchuria, some of them were ordered to resist the Chinese Righteous Volunteer Army, but because the sorghum was everywhere, they could not move. Some of the cavalry were sent to Harbin and the area north of the Middle East Railway and its line, but due to the floods near Harbin this year, there was no progress. However, this failure of the cavalry, on the one hand, caused dissatisfaction with the cavalry among other units of the Japanese army in Manchuria, and on the other hand, it caused a great conflict between the cavalry commander and the General Headquarters of the Japanese army in Manchuria. Because the battles in various parts of Manchuria were fierce, and because its troops were distributed everywhere, the Japanese army in Manchuria showed that its army was not fully prepared for the sanitary matters of rescuing the wounded and the supply of provisions in the army, and lacked personnel to transport the wounded (especially in areas far from the railway) and treat the wounded. Therefore, many soldiers were very tired due to the above reasons and because they had been fighting for a long time, and expressed dissatisfaction with their superiors. Moreover, some Japanese troops often looted from the people because provisions could not be supplied on time, which on the one hand aroused the opposition of the people, and on the other hand, it indulged the soldiers in carrying out looting, resulting in the decline of military discipline and giving the left-leaning parties an excuse to incite in the army. Therefore, the Japanese army commander has been very uneasy recently.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese detectives seem to have a good organization on the surface, it is actually proven that they are not fully trained. There are only seven Japanese intelligence agencies in Harbin alone. Their work is subject to the orders of various military and administrative agencies of their headquarters, and there is no mutual contact between them. Therefore, the information they obtain often loses its timeliness. From the beginning of the Manchurian Incident until the spring of this year, the Japanese reconnaissance work in Manchuria was assisted by a large number of White Russian émigrés. However, later, due to Japan's change of its policy of treating White Russian émigrés, and due to its friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the White Russian émigrés also changed their attitude towards Japan. The Japanese side has now abandoned the White Russian émigrés. Therefore, the entire White Russian émigré community does not accept Japan's actions now, but there are still people who are used by Japan, but only on a personal basis, and there is no power in the entire émigré community. The people who are used by Japan and their places of residence are as follows: Harbin: 1. Usevold (Vrerolad) Ivanov (Tranoff); 2. Slavyansky; 3. Golavachev. Shenyang: 1. Klerje; 2. Tetoohoft. Dalian: Semenoff. In early September, a survey team organized by officers of the Japanese General Staff was ordered to come to Manchuria to investigate the situation in Manchuria. After their investigation, the conclusions they reached are roughly as follows: The area north of the Middle East Railway in Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province is completely under the control of the Chinese army, and the local people and the local government still do not recognize "Manchukuo" and Japan. In the area near the Songhua River, although the local government has recognized the "new regime," the local people refuse to recognize it. In the area near Mongolia (southwest of Qiqihar and west of Taonan), the local government and the people have recognized the "night government." On the border of Rehe, they will never recognize the "new regime," and the people there are extremely resentful of the "new country" and Japan. The area east of Jilin City is very dangerous, because the anti-Japanese and anti-Manchu movements of the local Chinese people can arouse the anti-Japanese sentiments of the Koreans residing there, and even affect the territory of Korea. The Japanese survey team has now made it clear that the effect of using a single military force is minimal, so it is necessary to find a way to negotiate with the representatives of the anti-Japanese Chinese army to discuss a solution, because in reality, Japan and "Manchukuo" can only protect the Japanese in the railway line area. The commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria firmly believes that when it is cold, the active movements of the Righteous Volunteer Army can be reduced, and it will be easier to wipe out the Righteous Volunteer Army troops, but it is also very difficult for the Japanese army to fight in winter, because the soldiers are not accustomed to the severe cold. Because Japan has this serious situation, it has temporarily stopped the problem of attacking Rehe. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Establishment of the Peiping Abolish War Association <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Peiping Branch of the General Alliance to Abolish Internal War held its inaugural meeting at the Peiping Chamber of Commerce in Xizhushikou at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 30th). Members Yong Jianqiu, Wu Dingchang, Ding Wenjiang, Zhou Yichun, Zhou Zuomin, Hu Shi, Leng Jiaji, Zhang Yuanshan, Jin Zhaojun, Xiong Xiling, Bai Binlin, Yang Jixian, Zou Quansun, etc., and representatives from various groups and trade associations, a total of 104 people, were present. Hu Shi was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. First, Mr. Hu gave an opening speech, saying that the association had been organized since May and was established in Shanghai on August 27th. It has been two months since then, and several internal wars have occurred during this process, especially the Shandong and Sichuan incidents, which are still ongoing. The establishment of the Peiping branch at this time seems ridiculous, making the organizers embarrassed, but it is still proceeding as usual. The establishment of this association is relatively late, so its strength is quite small. If it had been established ten years ago, China would never have changed to such a state, and Mr. Han and Liu of Lu (Shandong), and the two Mr. Liu of Sichuan, would not have dared to start an internal war. Even if internal wars do not stop, we must still oppose them. Although it seems ridiculous, it is actually very important. Today's newspaper reported that Lord Lytton, chairman of the League of Nations investigation team, made a statement saying that "the League of Nations is the lifeline of modern culture." This General Alliance to Abolish Internal War can also be compared to the League of Nations, or it may also be the lifeline of modern China. After Mr. Hu finished speaking, Wu Dingchang, a member of the Standing Committee of the General Association, gave a report, saying that the association was established in Shanghai on August 27th and has only been two months old to date. Before its establishment, there was the Guangxi-Guangdong incident. Less than a month after its establishment, the Shandong and Sichuan incidents started again. Regarding the Guangxi-Guangdong incident, the association entrusted Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Chen Liting, and Cha Liangzhao to go there. The situation has been reported. Mr. Zhang Boling was also entrusted to go to Shandong. The military authorities all expressed that they would immediately stop the war. Regarding the Sichuan incident, Liu Xiang and Liu Wenguang also sent telegrams to the association, stating that they would never engage in internal war. However, in fact, the conflict between Sichuan and Shandong has not stopped, and it is not known how it will expand. In these two months, experience has shown that, on the one hand, it proves that the concerns of our colleagues are not excessive. Even in the midst of national crisis, there are many soldiers who still do not care. They do not pay attention to our national public opinion and are still hypocritical. On the other hand, it proves that our General Alliance to Abolish Internal War is still weak and cannot have the effect of dissuading or stopping it. The reason for this can be said to be that the association was established too recently, or that the organizers are not doing their best, but I think the root cause is that comrades like to stand outside the circle of the General Alliance to Abolish Internal War to criticize and supervise, and do not like to stand inside the circle to share responsibilities and think of ways together. Although nearly 500 groups have joined the association, it is still a small number compared to the size of China. For example, in the recent Shandong incident, only two or three groups in Jinan have joined the association, and there are no groups that have joined the association in Yantai. There are also not many individual members in both locations, so our temporary sports work has encountered various difficulties. When the General Alliance to Abolish Internal War was first launched in May, I gave a speech at Nankai University, saying that the effectiveness of the association depends entirely on the number of people who join it. Now the General Association is doing its best to urge the establishment of more branches across the country and to recruit more members in order to increase its strength. On the occasion of the establishment of the Peiping branch, I would like to report the opinions of everyone in the General Association, hoping that all members will do their best to introduce comrades, and at the same time, I hope that the national public opinion circle will cooperate and promote it in addition to criticizing and supervising, and do not think that the General Alliance to Abolish Internal War is privately owned by a small number of members who have joined it. In fact, we believe that this organization will not have great and rapid effectiveness unless it is publicly owned by the majority of the people. We believe that the movement to abolish internal war will inevitably succeed, because if it does not succeed, internal war every day is equivalent to suicide every day. In this world, China will inevitably be subjugated. In other words, if we believe that China will not be subjugated, we should believe that the movement to abolish internal war will inevitably succeed, but whether it can succeed sooner depends on the efforts of the people throughout the year. After Mr. Wu finished his report, Leng Jiaji, a member of the preparatory committee of the Peiping branch, reported on the preparatory process. Then, the branch's constitution was revised and passed. It was originally scheduled to elect five standing committee members on the spot, but due to time constraints, it was decided by public discussion to use the postal voting method. The ballots were limited to being delivered to the preparatory committee within ten days, and the ballots were opened in public. Five members of the preparatory committee were designated as members of the election committee. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Fifth Division Recovers the Bandit Den in Eastern Jiangxi <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Fang Shao No Longer Has a Base in Eastern Jiangxi</p>
<p>The Armies of Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangxi are Jointly Suppressing</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The military campaign to suppress the communists in Jiangxi Province is most tense in eastern Jiangxi. Therefore, since the Fifth Division of Zhou Hunyuan was transferred back to Guixi from Fuzhou, the armies have taken an offensive against the bandit troops of Fang Shao in the seven counties under the old Guangxin prefectures. Their forces include the divisions of Zhao Guantao, Li Yunheng, Ruan Zhaochang, Zhou Hunyuan, and Wang Jinwen. They have adopted a four-sided encirclement, with the destination of their convergence being Hengfeng and Geyuan. After the general attack, Fang Shao first abandoned the bandit dens in the lower reaches of the Xin River. For example, Fulin in Wannian and Zhoufang on the border between Yujiang and Guixi had already been recovered by Li's division. The bandits' puppet 10th Army and Red Police Division completely retreated to the upper reaches of the Xin River and near the Fujian-Zhejiang border. After the battle of Chepan, the bandits withdrew from the bandit dens on the south bank of the upper reaches of the Xin River and retreated to a corner on the north bank of the upper reaches of the Xin River. According to Zhou Shida, a soldier of the puppet Red Police Division who surrendered to Li's division, Fang's bandits' puppet 10th Army crossed the Xin River through Huangshagang from northern Fujian in early October and entered Geyuan, immediately ordering the soviets of various counties to order the people to rush to send straw shoes and cloth shoes for combat use. After Hengfeng County was recovered by Xiao's brigade of Zhou's division on the 10th of October, Fang Shao regarded Geyuan as the final bastion, attempting a desperate gamble, because this place had been occupied by the bandits for three or four years, and the people had been completely banditized. After Fang's bandits lost Mopan Mountain the year before last, they used this as the capital of the puppet Jiangxi-Fujian province (called Geyuan Province), sparing no effort in its management. The puppet Jiangxi-Northeast Revolutionary Committee, the puppet Fujian-Jiangxi Provincial Government, the puppet Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and the Red Army School, etc., were all available. The arsenal they operated had 500 workers and could produce tens of thousands of bullets every day, which Fang Shao entrusted with his life. It has recently been learned from Guixi that Zhou's division stationed in Hengfeng had three or four regiments. Because bandits were as numerous as hairs in the four townships, the search and suppression have not stopped. On October 14, a company of soldiers patrolled more than ten miles away from the city and discovered a team of armed bandits. A battle was immediately engaged. The bandits fled to the northeast, and Zhou's division took advantage of the victory to pursue them straight to Geyuan, where a large number of Red bandits came out to encircle them. Just as they were in a very dangerous situation, the 29th Regiment rushed to the scene and entered Geyuan, engaging in street fighting with the bandits, killing three or four hundred bandits, and seizing more than thirty guns. The remaining bandits fled in all directions, and Fang Shao's only old nest, which he had managed for many years and was deeply rooted, was occupied by Zhou's division. All kinds of puppet agencies and all equipment were destroyed. Commander Zhou has also built fortifications around the area because of its importance, forming a strong position and stationing heavy troops to prevent the Red bandits from coming again. At the moment, Fang's bandits have disintegrated and scattered across the mountainous areas of Chong'an, Pucheng, Qianshan, Guangfeng, Shangrao, Guixi, Yiyang, Hengfeng, Dechang, Leping, Wannian, and Fuliang, attempting to revive themselves. However, the troops of Qian Yuguang, Dai Yue, Zhao Guantao, and Ruan Zhaochang on the border of Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui have contacted each other and are engaged in suppression. Although the bandits are good at fleeing, they will have no place to use their skills. (October 30-31)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Guangdong Army Attacks Jiangxi Communist Bandits from Both Sides <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Huang's Division on the Fujian Border Coordinates with the 19th Route Army in Suppressing</p>
<p>Peng's Bandits in Western Jiangxi Re-Attack Chongyi but are Repelled</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the 19th Route Army in Fujian launched a major campaign to suppress the communist bandits in Changting, the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province have gathered more than 20,000 in the Ruijin and Shicheng area, attempting a final struggle. Guangdong Province is also coordinating with the Fujian army, sending troops to block and attack them. Huang Renhuan's division stationed in Jiaoling has moved towards the Fujian border. In the future, fierce battles will be unavoidable in places such as Jiangkou in eastern Jiangxi. At present, in addition to the main force of the Jiangxi Red bandits retreating to Ruijin, Peng Dehuai's bandits in western Jiangxi are also moving towards western Jiangxi, attempting to break through the southern line and join forces with Zhu De's troops in eastern Jiangxi. Therefore, Peng's bandits have repeatedly attacked the Ganzhou and Chongyi area in recent days. After the bandit den of Dawangdong was destroyed, Chongyi has been secured. The First Division of the First Army stationed in Ganzhou is responsible for the defense, with the guard team led by Chen Dachang. The original defensive army, Wang Dao's regiment, was transferred to Shangyou. The first and second regiments were stationed on the left and right sides of Anyingqian. Recently, Peng Dehuai's bandits, in order to respond to the red flames in eastern Jiangxi, gathered the remnant bandits on the 14th and re-attacked Chongyi. Fortunately, the defensive army was prepared in advance and sent the guard team to meet the attack. At the same time, Chen Zhang's Second Independent Brigade stationed in Dayu immediately sent Li Kangxiu's First Regiment to aid, launching a fierce attack on the bandits, killing more than thirty bandits and seizing dozens of guns, and finally repelling Peng's bandits. At present, Li's regiment of Chen Zhang's Second Independent Brigade is stationed in Yangmeisi, which belongs to Chongyi. Liang Rongqiu's regiment of the brigade is stationed in Nan'an. The First Training Regiment is still stationed in Jiudushui, and Xie Xizhen's Second Training Regiment is stationed in Nankang, increasing the defense line in southern Jiangxi and coordinating with the First Army of Yu Hanmou's troops in Ganzhou City. As for the Second Division of the First Army stationed near Ganzhou City, it is also engaged in searching for the remaining bandits.</p>

<p>Organizing the militia and handling the pacification affairs of Ganzhou. A small number of communist bandits appeared in Dongfeng, Ganzhou a few days ago. Ye's division dispatched the training unit led by Deng Qichang to search Maodian at about 4:00 AM on the 23rd. Battalion Commander Chen Shuying led two battalions to advance towards Tanqian. Regiment Commander Deng's unit encountered a group of bandits, numbering about several hundred, near Maodian and immediately opened fire. The two sides held out for about two hours, and the bandits scattered, leaving more than thirty bodies behind. More than twenty people were captured alive, and thirty-one rifles were seized. The remaining bandits fled towards Hongkou. Deng's regiment rescued more than ten hostages in the bandit area and sent them back to Ganzhou for disposal. When Battalion Commander Chen's two battalions were blocking and attacking the fleeing bandits, they killed a puppet captain of the Red bandits and captured the so-called township chairman in the bandit area, all of whom were sent back to the rear for interrogation.

<p>Tongji Won the Charity Basketball Game Last Night Against St. John's</p>
<p>The result was 24 to 20</p>
<p>Temporary Appearances by Various Teams</p>
<p>Many teams participated enthusiastically in the so-called charity basketball game, which is commendable. However, most of the teams participating in the games were not officially contacted, and it is not known who is in charge of the charity competition. There was no official plenary meeting. St. John's and Hujiang, etc., did not know the details. However, since things have come to this point, they can only embrace the spirit of patriotism and public service and reluctantly put together a team to help. Victory or defeat is not important. However, it will be difficult to attract the audience and get a huge income.</p>
<p>Last night was the opening of the competition, with about 200 spectators. There were originally four games, but the third group, the women's Liangjiang vs. Jiangnan, also did not appear due to procedural issues. It is unfortunate that this kind of phenomenon occurred at the opening. In the Group A game, Tongji University defeated St. John's with a score of 24 to 20. St. John's players Hou Xuemin, Diao Youdao, and Cheng Jingxing, etc., did not play. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Zhengfeng Wins Over Overseas Chinese...19 to 18</p>
<p>The first game was Zhengfeng vs. Overseas Chinese in Group B, which started at 5:00 PM. The two teams competed fiercely and were difficult to separate. At the end of the first half, they tied with 8 points each. In the second half, the teams were eager to win, and the lineup was very chaotic. In the end, Zhengfeng narrowly won by one point, with a score of 19 to 18.</p>
<p>Zhengfeng Fouls Score Overseas Chinese Fouls Score</p>
<p>Ju Shangming 2 0 Wang Xijun 0 5</p>
<p>Wu Zijing 1 5 Ma Can 0 2</p>

<p>Total 3 19 Total 2 18</p>
<p>First Half Zhengfeng 8 points Overseas Chinese 8 points</p>
<p>Second Half Zhengfeng 11 points Overseas Chinese 10 points</p>
<p>St. John's Wins Over Huahua...47 to 12</p>
<p>The second game, St. John's Affiliated Middle School vs. Huahua, was a one-sided situation. The strength of the two sides was very different. The St. John's team was petite and exquisite, lively and good at fighting, with good connections and accurate shooting. Huahua's offense and defense were clumsy and at a loss. The situation was still good in the first half, with St. John's scoring 18 points and Huahua scoring 10 points. In the second half, St. John's became more and more skilled and won with a score of 47 to 12.</p>
<p>St. John's Fouls Score Huahua Fouls Score</p>
<p>Zhang Yuangu 12 12 Cheng Mingxing 2 2</p>
<p>Xu Wendi 6 6 Ji Bingqi 0 0</p>
<p>Zhou Xuexian 10 10 Wu Rendi 0 6</p>
<p>Li Mingguang 5 5 Liu Qi 1 0</p>
<p>Feng Fangcui 6 6 Huang Zuning 0 4</p>
<p>Wu Zhiyi 2 2 Total 3 12</p>
<p>Zhang Peixin 6 6 First Half St. John's 18 points</p>
<p>Tong Yuchun 0 0 Huahua 10 points</p>
<p>Sun Baoshan 0 0 Second Half St. John's 29 points</p>
<p>Total 1 47 Huahua 1 point</p>
<p>Tongji Wins Over St. John's: 24 to 20</p>
<p>The third group, women's, did not compete. The Jiangnan and Dongyun women's teams joined as guest players. This was followed by the Group A game between Tongji and St. John's. Tongji's team had old players from previous years, and their skills were not bad. St. John's team had been famous for a long time. However, Hou Xue, Cheng Jingxing, and Diao Youdao, the three generals, did not play yesterday, which was disappointing. Therefore, the ideal wonderful performance became an ordinary game. After the start of the game, Tongji's offense was very fierce, and they explored the basket many times. Although they did not score much, the situation was very good. The Fandongdu team lacked talent, and the lineup was scattered. They were often at a disadvantage and lost to the opponent. The score was 14 to 9 in the first half, with Tongji winning by 5 points. The situation was quite average in the second half. Liang Yiyue of St. John's attacked fiercely and was eager for revenge, but in the end, there was no way to surpass the front. The score was always 4 or 5 points apart. In the end, Tongji won with a score of 24 to 20. The referee was Peng Wenyu. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Tongji University Name Position Shots Free Throws Fouls Score</p>
<p>Wang Jilu Right Forward 3 0 0 6</p>
<p>Shu Changmei Right Forward 0 0 0 0</p>

<p>Liangjiang Team Denies Participation in Disaster Relief Competition</p>
<p>Regarding the disaster relief basketball game last night, the school was deeply surprised that it had not received any notice in advance and that there was no formal meeting or scheduled competition order. The association then announced it in the newspapers, which was quite peculiar. The school said that someone had invited them to participate in the competition, which was to help the Northeast Volunteer Army. Now the nature has changed, and there is no basis for it, which is different from the original proposal. It is said that the school has sent a letter denying participation.</p>

<p>Debate in British Tennis Circles Over Net-Cord Shots</p>
<p>Most Do Not Support Changing the Rules</p>
<p>Awaiting Opinions of Famous Players</p>
<p>(Reuters London Dispatch) The Advisory Committee of the International Lawn Tennis Federation's suggestion that all net-cord shots be replayed has become the center of heated debate here. Most do not support the change.</p>
<p>The expressed intentions of famous players participating in recent major competitions seem to be divided on this issue. However, if it were put to a vote, the majority would not support this rule change.</p>
<p>New Rules Will Affect the Game</p>
<p>If these new rules were adopted, the result would be a slowdown in the game, which is unacceptable. It would be unfair for players to be penalized for low shots that their opponents fail to reach. The current rules are naturally flawed and unjust. How this newly proposed change will be viewed is of great interest and deserves attention.</p>
<p>Net-Cord Shots Involve Skill</p>
<p>Net-cord shots are naturally more fortunate than anything else, but proponents argue that they actually involve considerable skill. A player naturally tries to hit the ball over the net as close to the tape as possible. If a player is lucky enough to have their ball graze the net and drop over, it is merely the "bad luck" of the opponent. Net-cord shots often decide the outcome of games, both big and small, and often surprise the audience.</p>
<p>The British Lawn Tennis Association has distributed this issue to Davis Cup players and famous clubs. The outcome is eagerly awaited by all those passionate about lawn tennis.</p>
<p>Baihong Track and Field Team Changes Train Departure Time for Beijing Competition</p>
<p>The Baihong Track and Field Team was originally scheduled to take a special express train to Beijing at 9:00 AM on the 4th for a challenge competition. It has been learned that, according to the Railway Bureau's regulations, group tickets cannot be used on special express trains. Therefore, the departure time has been changed to 7:00 AM. All team members must assemble at the clock under the North Station at 6:10 AM on the 4th. Do not be late.</p>
<p>Zhu Kuan Wins Handball Championship</p>
<p>Sun Daosheng Ranks Second</p>

Zhu had to fight through many opponents, and the final two games against Hong Yukui and Sun Daosheng were the most intense. Sun's performance yesterday was better than before. There was an amazing performance in the second game. Therefore, the scores of both sides were very close. He is now ranked second. In the Cheng vs. Huang game, Cheng Zhenhua lost to Huang Keshu 13-21, 21-13, and 21-15. Cheng has ascended to the fifth seat after his victory.

<p>New Basketball Skills (20) (5)</p>
<p>(Not Allowed) to Reprint</p>
<p>Original by Claire Burcky</p>
<p>Translated by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>Each teammate should quickly prepare to attack and act on time, which are the two most important conditions when throwing out-of-bounds balls. This article shows how to block the opponent's defensive players.</p>
<p>Player No. 4 stands outside the opponent's defensive zone and throws the ball inbounds. Player No. 3 and Player No. 5 stand near the sideline, within two or three yards. When Signal One is given, Player No. 5 immediately steps forward to block Player No. 3's guard. Player No. 3 takes advantage of the situation, receives the pass from Player No. 4, and goes straight down the line. Player No. 3's guard is blocked by Player No. 5 and Player No. 5's guard, so Player No. 3 can safely dribble the ball into the empty area and shoot.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Many Sons From One Stem</p>
<p>Zhan Lu</p>
<p>It is not surprising that emperors with polygamous tendencies often had dozens of sons. Hongwu Emperor of the Ming Dynasty and Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty each had dozens of sons, although not all from the same mother.</p>
<p>It is more unusual to have many sons all born from the same mother. During the Kangxi era, there was a scholar's wife named Zheng who gave birth to thirty-six sons. More recently, a Mrs. Maryce in England had 169 descendants.</p>
<p>During the Kangxi era, a scholar named Zheng, who served as a prefectural magistrate in Jiangnan, always wore tattered clothing to court each day. The governor, recognizing his competence, generously rewarded him. Yet, his clothes remained as worn as ever. The governor suspected him of feigning poverty and questioned him. Zheng replied that he had thirty-six sons and a heavy family burden, leading to his inability to afford proper clothing and food. The governor chuckled, "You have taken too many concubines." Zheng responded, "I only have one wife. Since marrying at eighteen, she has given birth every year, each time to twins. Now, at thirty-six, I have thirty-six sons." The governor ordered them to be brought in for inspection. Zheng led his thirty-six sons into the hall, the older ones carrying the younger, the middle ones leading the youngest, quickly filling the space. The governor laughed heartily and provided Zheng with a generous allowance for his family. He also reported the matter to his superiors, who provided additional subsidies. This account is recorded in the *Jian Gu Ji*.</p>
<p>A Western newspaper reported that a Mrs. Maryce in Stoke-on-Trent, England, is ninety-eight years old. On the day of her birthday celebration, her descendants came to offer blessings: fourteen children, fifty-five grandchildren, ninety-nine great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild, totaling one hundred and sixty-nine people, all descended from her. One from China, one from the West, one ancient, one modern—both women are worthy of endless astonishment.</p>
<p>If every woman were like these two matriarchs, where would we place so many little citizens on Earth? Unless the Earth could also become pregnant and give birth to hundreds of new Earths, it would be impossible.</p>
<p>Earthworm and Leather Ball</p>
<p>Zhu Jun</p>
<p>Two Painful Metaphors</p>
<p>Some say that the Chinese people are like an earthworm. If someone pierces it with a needle, it immediately contracts its body, making a brief struggle—but not resistance. When the child's conscience dawns and the needle is removed, the earthworm immediately forgets the pain the needle inflicted and returns to its original state, even though the needle scar still causes slight pain. When the child's needle visits it a second time, it again contracts its body, enduring the pain and making another struggle. However, as soon as the needle leaves its body, it immediately forgets all the suffering and reveals its original state. Piercing and contracting, contracting and piercing, the child finds it very amusing, while the earthworm being harmed considers it a normal occurrence, not worthy of shame. But if the mischievous child never realizes the cruelty of his actions and continues to pierce and pull, pull and pierce, then the earthworm's body will develop a numbness and feel no pain. The result, needless to say, will be a meek and compliant death in the child's hands.</p>
<p>Others say that the Chinese people are like a leather ball. At first, it is filled with plenty of air. If someone hits it, it will jump up violently, demonstrating the strength of its vitality. The harder it is hit, the higher it jumps. But if, after too much trampling, it loses its air, it will lie listlessly on the ground, no longer reacting, even if you hit it hard. Then, people can confidently cut it open and use it to patch shoes.</p>
<p>Of course, I am unwilling to believe these two painful metaphors, but the facts clearly confirm them. What else can I say?</p>
<p>Brother-in-Law</p>
<p>Zhong Yan</p>
<p>An Anecdote from the Jiaodong War</p>
<p>Northern soldiers are often from Caozhou, Shandong. When angry, they curse by calling someone "jiuzi" or "xiaojiuzi," much like the more common "tama de" [your mother's]. "Jiuzi" means "younger brother of the wife," the counterpart to "brother-in-law."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Jiaodong War, a Liu Zhennian army officer stationed in Fushan was walking along the road with a bicycle when a villager accidentally bumped into him. Enraged, the officer wanted to slap the villager, who became terrified and repeatedly called him "brother-in-law." The officer, surprised, asked why. The villager replied, "Even if I don't call you brother-in-law, you will still call me 'jiuzi.'" By this time, a crowd had gathered. The officer flushed with embarrassment and left. This is just one humorous anecdote from the midst of the intense Jiaodong War.</p>
<p>Biting on Vegetable Roots</p>
<p>Rong Yu</p>
<p>"If you can bite on vegetable roots, you can do anything."</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Huanzhang, who has retired from public life, wears coarse cloth and chews on hard bread. How frugal! Yet, many people criticize him for being affected. I think that even if the old gentleman is hypocritical and out of step with the times, in this extravagant society, his refusal to wear imported goods and his willingness to "set an example" are admirable.</p>
<p>In the city, one cannot show off their wealth without extravagant eating. Spending a hundred gold coins on a meal is common and unremarkable. Therefore, someone said, "A rich family's feast is a poor man's half-year's worth of grain." This is not an exaggeration at all.</p>
<p>When it comes to eating, the principle is simply to avoid hunger and replenish energy. Satisfying your appetite is impossible. The ancients had a saying, "Food and sex are human nature." A single man hopes to take a wife. Once he has a plain wife, he hopes for a beautiful woman. Eating is the same. Having vegetables, he wants fish and meat. After fish and meat, he wants delicacies from land and sea. With such insatiable greed, it is better to bite on vegetable roots and find joy in hardship.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of biting on vegetable roots? According to health experts, vegetables can purify the blood and are rich in nutrients. According to religious people, eating vegetables can prevent killing and prolong life. Let's leave those two aspects aside. Plucking huge melons from the vine and digging fresh vegetables from the field—as long as they are cooked properly, their flavor is no less than that of fish and meat. Why must one eat fish and chew meat to be considered fortunate?</p>
<p>People in the countryside are used to biting on vegetable roots. Fish and meat rarely enter their homes unless there are important guests or it is a holiday. Yet, their bodies are so strong, their complexions so full of color. This shows the effectiveness of biting on vegetable roots. People in the city! I advise you to bite on vegetable roots! In the end, they taste much better than tree roots.</p>
<p>I remember a few lines of poetry: "Cook tofu, gourds, eggplant, and leaves." "Turnips are fat when the wine is ripe." There is pleasure in biting on vegetable roots. You can see it from these two lines of poetry. "If you can bite on vegetable roots, you can do anything." Although it is an exhortation from a moralistic teacher, we might as well try it.</p>

<p>Derived From Experience</p>
<p>Having exhausted much effort and visited many friends, you have finally managed to find a place to eat. Now you should be planning how to keep this golden rice bowl and not lose it! Here are a few tips, please see:</p>
<p>(1) Towards the Principal</p>
<p>When you first enter the school, the principal will of course talk to you about his educational policy, you just have to listen carefully. If he asks about the content of the school you used to work at, then you must not reveal everything, and avoid mentioning economic aspects.</p>
<p>(2) Towards Colleagues</p>
<p>You should not stir up trouble by promoting new educational methods, societies, etc., although these things are welcomed by the principal, but the colleagues will suffer, and it is inevitable that you will incur resentment from your colleagues.</p>
<p>(3) Towards Students</p>
<p>When talking to students, quote more foreign leaders, then the students will look at your belly very mysteriously.</p>

<p>Workers at the Sanyou Factory Clash While Preventing the Transportation of Chrysanthemums</p>
<p>Worker Zhu Zhaoji and Others Severely Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>Twelve Suspects Arrested and Sent to the General Bureau for Disposition</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Society, though mediated by the municipal government and adjudicated by the local court, remains unresolved due to the employer's appeal. Yesterday, when the factory attempted to transport chrysanthemums, workers, upon learning of it and citing the ongoing dispute, came out to obstruct the move, leading to a clash. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Obstructing the Transportation of Chrysanthemums</p>
<p>The Sanyou Industrial Society has a chrysanthemum garden occupying about twenty acres at the east end of the main factory in Yinxiang Township. Every autumn, during the society's big sale, the chrysanthemums grown in the garden are potted and transported to the Nanjing Road branch to be given to customers as a way to attract business. Although the factory announced its closure this year, the affiliated horticultural department has not ceased operations. Therefore, the planted chrysanthemums (estimated to be over 30,000 pots) are now in full bloom. Recently, as the autumn sale period approached, the employer intended to transport the chrysanthemums to the branch and hold a chrysanthemum exhibition before distributing them to customers. Upon hearing this, the workers, angered by the employer's defiance of government orders and refusal to pay autumn food allowances, which they saw as a deliberate attempt to prolong the dispute, resolved to prevent the transportation of the chrysanthemums. Fearing obstruction by the workers, the factory sent a letter to the local Fifth District, Fourth Precinct, requesting protection and assistance with the transportation.</p>
<p>Clash Occurs</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, the factory hired four trucks from the China Moving Company and instructed workers, led by the main factory director, Lao Huimin, and staff member Yin Wenlong, to go to the horticultural department to transport the chrysanthemums. Upon seeing this, some workers stepped forward to explain the situation to the drivers, requesting them not to assist with the transportation. The Fifth District, Fourth Precinct, upon receiving a report, dispatched police officers and the factory police brigade to the scene to dissuade them and maintain order. At that moment, the workers dispatched by the factory suddenly seized the opportunity to break down the eastern garden gate and rushed into the garden, leading to a clash with the workers preventing the transportation of the chrysanthemums. Order was disrupted, and traffic was blocked. Police officers at the scene were unable to stop them. Seven workers, including Zhu Zhaoji, Sun Sanbao, Ji Fulin, Sun Bujun, Zhu Yinhai, Zhang Gentu, and Chen Yibiao, were wounded by axes and clubs. All suffered severe injuries to their hands, feet, and heads.</p>
<p>Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, the factory union (Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Union) dispatched two supervisors, Zhang Yihai and Fan Bangyong, to the Fifth District, Fourth Precinct, to negotiate and request the arrest of the assailants. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also received a report and dispatched Inspector Zhen Yang to the scene. The precinct chief ordered the arrest of the suspects, including Luo Shizhong, Yang Changlin, Xu Daluo, Lin Xianshou, Hong Meishuo, Niu Jinye, Luo Shixuan, Luo Ailin, Hong Daoyun, Yang Mingfa, Luo Shengfu, Zhang Huagui, and twelve others. Considering the gravity of the case, the precinct chief interrogated them before sending the suspects and injured workers to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<p>Party and Government Investigation</p>
<p>After the incident, the Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Union dispatched representatives Xia Zhongzhao and Gong Zishen to the municipal party headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to report the incident, requesting a thorough investigation and severe punishment of the assailants. Upon receiving the report, the party and government organs dispatched Long Peiyun from the municipal party headquarters and Wang Gang from the Social Affairs Bureau to the Yinxiang Port main factory to investigate the details of the dispute for further action.</p>
<p>Chen Zhaokuan Arrives in Shanghai for Talks</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: Chen Shaokuan, Navy Minister and Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, arrived in Shanghai by train yesterday morning from Beijing. When interviewed, he stated regarding the recent situation of the Navy: (1) When Chairman Chiang went to Hunan, the Navy dispatched the Chu Youwei, Sheng Jiang, Xi Jiang, and Kun four warships to accompany him. Details are unknown as no telegram has been received. (2) The current Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government is Minister Yang (Shuzhuang). As for rumors of reorganization and who will succeed him after the reorganization, I have only seen reports in the newspapers. (3) Commander of the First Fleet Chen Jiliang is inspecting the entire Navy. Chen is inspecting all coastal areas where the Navy and agencies are stationed. His flagship is the Hai Chou. The inspection in Beijing has been completed, and Commander Chen will arrive at Songkou the day after tomorrow (tomorrow), and then proceed to inspect the Zhejiang and Fujian areas. (4) The Navy Ministry recently sent four students to study in the UK, who will leave for abroad in a few days. Ten students who previously studied in the UK have completed their studies and returned. Four arrived in Shanghai today, and another one will be arriving soon. (5) The Ping Hai, Fu Hai, and Ning Fu naval ships being built by the shipyard are all under construction. However, the Ping Hai is larger in scale and more costly, and due to economic constraints, progress is not actively underway, making it difficult to predict when it will be launched.</p>
<p>Japanese Counselor Areno Speaks</p>
<p>Denies Opinion Paper Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to Return Home Within Days</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Japanese Minister to China, Akira Ariyoshi, yesterday at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai. First Secretary Areno appeared on his behalf. A record of the conversation is below:</p>
<p>Regarding Opinions on the Report</p>
<p>Reports from Tokyo stated that three boxes of Japan's opinions on the League of Nations investigation report had been transported to Shanghai via the Nagasaki Maru to be delivered to the Chinese government by the Japanese Ambassador. This news is completely unfounded. The embassy has not received the so-called three boxes of opinions. Even if Japan were to send opinions to China, there would certainly not be three boxes. Japan's opinions on the report will be formally announced by the Japanese government. The Japanese side has mixed reactions to the various items listed in the investigation report, supporting those beneficial to Japan and opposing those that are not, which is the same as the Chinese authorities' views on the report.</p>
<p>Problem of Road Construction Beyond Boundaries</p>
<p>When the reporter inquired about the reasons for the Japanese community's opposition to the recovery of roads constructed beyond boundaries, Areno initially stated that road construction beyond boundaries was a local issue and he did not wish to express any opinion. He then said that the Japanese community opposes the recovery because it believes there is no need to change the current situation. As for the attitude of the Japanese Embassy, it cannot express any opinion because it has not yet received instructions from the government.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Patriotic Movements</p>
<p>Areno criticized our people's patriotic movements, saying that it is not an action that civilized countries should have. He added that the actions of groups like the Blood Oath to Eliminate Traitors were worrying. Therefore, the Japanese consulate has requested Mayor Wu to crack down on them. Fortunately, these actions have gradually decreased recently. The reporter retorted, "Should civilized countries not have popular patriotic movements?" Areno casually replied, "Yes, yes."</p>
<p>Ariyoshi to Return Home Soon</p>
<p>Areno also told the reporter that Japanese Ambassador Akira Ariyoshi is scheduled to return home within days and will return to Shanghai in three weeks. All embassy affairs will be handled by Counselor Horiuchi.</p>
<p>Embassy Virtually Moving South</p>
<p>The rumor of the Japanese Embassy moving south was once rampant last year. Areno indicated yesterday that the Japanese Embassy has no intention of moving south at present. However, with almost all embassy personnel in Shanghai, it is virtually moving south. He also said that if the move were official, it would be even more convenient.</p>
<p>Brief News from Japan</p>
<p>Japanese Navy to Arrive</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy Ministry, on the pretext of transferring Shanghai marines from the Sasebo naval group, has dispatched a battalion of marines, totaling 500 men, to Shanghai aboard the special service ship Muroto. News was received yesterday that the naval battalion is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this Sunday. After arriving in Shanghai, a portion will be sent to Hankou. In addition, the naval mine officers and soldiers sent to Shanghai by the Japanese Navy Ministry during the January 28th Incident will be reduced by 30, with 70 remaining, stationed in Shanghai and Hankou.</p>
<p>Japanese Pass Through Shanghai</p>
<p>During the winter in Shanghai, Japanese merchants who operate sugar businesses in the South Sea Islands returned to Japan, taking 110 Japanese laborers to Okinawa and other places to work in Japanese-owned sugar factories in Java and other places, in order to develop the Japanese presence in the South Seas. Unexpectedly, this year, Java's sugar production was excessive, and due to China's increase in import duties, very little was shipped, causing many factories to shut down. The Japanese expatriates were unable to support themselves and had to be sent back to Japan. Led by Japanese man Tatsuno, they first took a Japanese ship to Shanghai and then transferred to the Rokko Maru to return to their home country.</p>
<p>Municipal Federation Submits a Request to the Municipal Party Headquarters to Revise the Regulations on Reducing and Exempting Rent</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: The Shanghai Special Zone Citizens' Federation submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday for assistance in reducing and exempting rent. The letter stated: According to a letter from the Thirteenth District branch of the Federation, the Zhongxi Bookstore, a member, stated that landlord Shang Wusheng requested mediation from the court to collect rent. On October 8th, mediation was carried out, and the judge ordered the rent for February and March to be paid in full, leading to the failure of mediation and the filing of a lawsuit. The rent for February and March was during the Shanghai war, when all sectors implemented a strike, and many places were exempt from rent. Later, landlord Shang Wusheng also made a written statement that all rent for February and March would be resolved by the municipal government. Currently, the Municipal Party Headquarters and other organizations have requested instructions from the central government, but no decision has been made. Shang Wusheng abruptly hired lawyer Wu Quan to file a lawsuit against our organization for rent arrears, which is extremely deceiving. Our organization insists that it does not acknowledge the rent arrears for February and March. If the central government does not agree to exempt rent, our organization will pay it accordingly. Shang Wusheng insists on receiving the full amount immediately, which is too impatient. Therefore, we specially request your association to provide assistance. The problem of reducing and exempting rent has been resolved by a joint meeting of the association and various groups. Before the central government sends personnel to Shanghai to revise the regulations, rent should be paid slowly. Now the tenant's house could not generate income during the strike in wartime, resulting in two months of arrears. In good conscience, this is not excessive. We should request your association to find a way to assist, etc., which has been received by the association. Recently, the market has become increasingly depressed, and all income is barely enough to pay rent. Without a revised method for reducing and exempting rent, countless stores will close this year. As for who is making efforts for the national crisis, your association has long been aware of it. If the central government can immediately send senior officials to Shanghai to revise the regulations on reducing and exempting rent, stores may be able to survive the crisis. Based on the above, we hereby submit a document requesting your association to submit another request to the central government to immediately send senior officials to Shanghai to revise the regulations on reducing and exempting rent, which is convenient for the party.</p>
<p>Eleven Male and Female Communists Sent to Nanjing</p>
<p>Tongmin News Agency reports: The Municipal Public Security Bureau, based on a secret report from investigators, stated that Communists hiding at No. 3 Ganxingfang, Binlang Road, Gordon Road, western Shanghai, were plotting wrongdoing. The bureau dispatched personnel to the Public Concession to cooperate with Chinese and Western detectives from the Gordon Road police station to go to the location and arrest the Communist principals Zhu Rongsheng, Su Zheng-hai, Rao Zhixiong, Chen Shanfu, Ji Weifang, Liu Zhifu, Wu Juchen, Liu Afang, Chen Wangshi, Wu Chenshi, and Zhu Caidi, totaling eleven men and women. They also found various anti-government items in the house. They were immediately taken to the Gordon Road police station for investigation and then escorted to the Special First Court. It is learned that the Special First Court approved the transfer of the suspects, including Su Zheng-hai, and evidence to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for review a few days ago, which has been reported by this newspaper. The bureau's Third Section interrogation team interrogated the suspects and reported their confessions to the municipal government for review and handling. The central government has now telegraphed the municipal government, instructing the Municipal Public Security Bureau to escort Su Zheng-hai and others, along with anti-government publications, to the Nanjing Gendarmerie Headquarters for handling at 11:00 p.m. the night before, dispatching six inspectors and detectives from the bureau and ten police officers from the First Company of the Police Brigade. They were escorted aboard the Shanghai-Nanjing night express train.</p>
<p>Robbers Rob Yuxianglong Hardware Store</p>
<p>Steal Bookkeeping Records and Contracts for Ransom</p>
<p>Has Been Robbed Three Times</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: At 7:15 yesterday morning, when the clerk of Yuxianglong Hardware Wholesale Store at No. 4 Yideli, Zilai Street, French Concession, opened the door, five robbers suddenly arrived, taking out black long handguns and ordering them not to make a sound. Three robbers were wearing blue long gowns and bird-hunting hats, and two robbers were wearing black short shirts and pants, speaking with a local accent, claiming that they had lost more than 20,000 yuan in business and had come to borrow 2,000 yuan. After speaking, they forced eight employees into the storeroom, with one robber guarding the door. Two robbers immediately went upstairs. At that time, the store manager, Tian Hexiang, was still asleep in the bedroom. The robbers knocked on the door. The manager initially did not suspect anything and opened the door. The robber immediately pointed the gun at Tian's chest, ordering him not to make a sound. Tian's wife, daughter, and maid were also dumbfounded. The robbers forced them into the storeroom downstairs and then went upstairs to search for money and belongings. At around 8:00, they took two leather suitcases downstairs with all the robbers and put the store's account books, checks, contracts, etc. into the suitcase and fled. Before leaving, they claimed that 20 yuan could redeem it. According to the store manager, Tian, the five robbers today intended to kidnap people, but because the store clerks resembled workers, they only robbed more than 700 yuan in cash. Because the amount robbed was too small, they grabbed the contract account books, stamps, checks, and personal share certificates worth about 30,000 yuan. He has now ordered the clerks to stop payment to various stores and banks. He also said that the store was truly unfortunate. It was previously located in Xingkangli, Laomenmen, and was also patronized by robbers. After moving to this location, it was also robbed in less than half a year, but the loss was only more than 200 yuan. Unexpectedly, in less than two months, it was patronized by robbers again.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Prohibits Collection of Petty Rents</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice: The owners and managers of real estate in this city, as well as old tenants, often privately collect petty rents from tenants or subtenants in addition to the regular rent, which is akin to extortion and violates regulations. The Municipal Government has repeatedly issued notices strictly prohibiting this, and orders have been issued to investigate and ban it. However, as time goes on, this habit is revived. It is now heard that landlords are still violating the ban and privately collecting the above-mentioned fees. This kind of harsh levy and layered exploitation is harmful to merchants and residents. In addition to issuing another notice to all district offices to earnestly investigate and ban it at any time, this notice is hereby issued, and all landlords, etc., must comply and eradicate this bad habit. If there is any further extortion, once verified, it will be investigated and dealt with severely according to the law and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Fang Canwen Accuses Uncle of Seizing Inheritance</p>
<p>Adopted Son Had Been Expelled Earlier</p>
<p>Plaintiff Has No Connection with the Fang Family</p>
<p>Fang Wencan, also known as Laohu, was adopted as a child by Fang Lunkui (also known as Fang Changhua), a resident of Fang's house on Chengdu Road West, Chongqing Road. As he grew up, he did not engage in proper business and often engaged in vulgar activities, so he was expelled early. Later, Lunkui's father, Fang Yaomao, passed away one after another. He did not participate in mourning or observing mourning etiquette. He wandered outside all year round. Lunkui's brother Bingkui also died many years ago. Now only one younger brother, Xikui, still lives in Fang's house. Wencan often asked his uncle Xikui for relief when he had difficulty making a living. On August 27th of this year, Xikui gave him 30 yuan at one time because he could not bear the harassment. Wencan issued a permanent entanglement note and stated in the note that he would no longer use the Fang family name. However, before the ink was dry, he relapsed and hired lawyer Lin Huanqing to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Fang Xikui of seizing the inheritance without providing an analysis. The lawsuit stated that his grandfather Fang Yaomao had three sons, the eldest was Zhankui, the second was Lunkui, and the youngest was the defendant. The movable and immovable property left by the grandfather was about 80,000, all in the hands of the defendant. The plaintiff is Lunkui's adopted son and should have the right to inherit the property. Please order the defendant to hand over all the property for a three-way distribution, and the plaintiff should receive 27,000, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou summoned him for trial. According to the plaintiff, he was not in Shanghai when his grandfather and parents died, so he did not know. It was found that the immovable property left behind was five rooms of Fang's house and six bungalows. As for the movable property, it was impossible to find out, etc. The defendant Fang Xikui was not present and extended lawyer Hong Shihuo to represent him in court. He stated that all the family property was divided equally by the defendant's father in the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign and a division book was drawn up. Furthermore, the defendant's eldest brother was named Bingkui, not Zhankui. The plaintiff was still unaware of the name and falsely claimed that the divided family property was not divided, but the plaintiff had been expelled by Lunkui early on and his adoptive son relationship was severed. He had no right to claim a share of the property. He also presented the division book, Yao Mao's deathbed will, and the recent self-written notes to prove that the plaintiff had nothing to do with the Fang family. The two lawyers then debated each other, and Judge Zhou ordered a judgment to be scheduled.</p>
<p>Preparations for the Chrysanthemum Exhibition Are Ready</p>
<p>Participation in the Exhibition Is Exempt from Ferry Fees</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs decided that the third Chrysanthemum Exhibition will be held from the 5th to the 7th of this month in the Donggou Municipal Garden. It is scheduled to invite from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on the 3rd. At the copper statue pier on the Bund of Nanjing Road, exhibitors will transport their products. It is heard that in order to benefit the exhibitors, the association has negotiated with the Municipal Public Utility Bureau Ferry General Administration that flowers and plants can be transported completely free of charge, and the association will issue a special coupon to the exhibitors for taking the ferry. On the one hand, the Review Committee Wang Yiting, Xie Gongzhan, Tong Yamin, Fan Shangyan, and other 11 people were hired to form a Review Committee to review the exhibits and reward them separately. The venue was designed and arranged, and a chrysanthemum house was built in the planned scenic garden, with a chrysanthemum mountain in the middle, where precious chrysanthemum varieties were placed to avoid wind and rain and facilitate appreciation. The chrysanthemum ridges around the house are square and varied, and different kinds of famous flowers are dotted among them. At the entrance of the main road, potted chrysanthemums are arranged to form the ten characters of the 3rd Shanghai Chrysanthemum Exhibition. At the entrance, there is also a chrysanthemum tower, which stands tall and is inlaid with different-colored chrysanthemums, showing the four characters of "The World is for All" to awaken the eyes and ears of tourists. What is even more surprising is that the garden originally belonged to the plain and barren area, but now the mountains and hills undulate, the chrysanthemum ridges stretch, the springs flow in twists and turns, and the flower shadows are varied, creating a momentum to protect the chrysanthemum house. Being in it, one almost mistakenly thinks that they have entered a peach source. Therefore, before the meeting, there were already many visitors.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Strictly Prohibits Slaughtering Pregnant Ewes</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, in order to protect the permanent interests of herders due to the increasing number of exported lambskins, ordered the construction departments and social bureaus of various provinces and cities to strictly prohibit the slaughter of pregnant sheep and advised the Ministry of Finance to strictly prohibit exports. The original order is recorded as follows: As an order to comply, it has recently been found that the country's sheep herding households often slaughter pregnant ewes in winter or early spring in order to seize current petty profits. The purpose is not the ewe's skin, but to obtain the fetal lamb, because the price of this immature lambskin, or fetal lambskin, is about four times the price of the ewe's skin. For this reason, a large number of pregnant ewes are killed every season. If these ewes are not killed, each one can produce an average of two lambs, and when they grow up, the value of their meat will not only be double that of fetal lambskin, but the ewe can also exist at the same time. This cruel and uneconomical slaughter has become more and more intense recently. If it is still allowed to do so, not only will the output of adult sheepskins decrease day by day, but also sheep will be in danger of extinction. Moreover, mutton is one of the most important foods for Chinese people's daily life. As for the various items made of fetal lambskin, they are only used for decoration by a small number of wealthy people, and the consumption to satisfy the vanity of a small number of people has a great impact on the people of the whole country, which is not worth it. All the production locations and export quantities of the fetal lambskins have been ordered by the Ministry to be investigated and reported by the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau. Last year, more than 700,000 pieces were exported from Tianjin alone, mostly from sheep-producing areas in the northwest and Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces. In order to protect sheep and maintain the permanent interests of herders, the Ministry should strictly ban this cruel slaughter. On the one hand, exports are prohibited to cut off sales, and on the other hand, herders are advised not to slaughter again to avoid losses. Both parties proceed, so that it can be completely prohibited. In addition to advising the Ministry of Finance to transfer orders to customs offices in North China and tax authorities to strictly investigate and prohibit the fetal lambskins and their manufactured products, and separately ordering the Tianjin and Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureaus of the Ministry not to inspect or prohibit exports, the Ministry will issue an order to the department to comply and transfer orders to all counties under its jurisdiction, announce strict bans on the slaughter of fetal sheep, and send personnel to conduct on-the-spot advice to herders, informing them of the advantages and disadvantages, and reporting the compliance situation for future reference.</p>
<p>Disaster Area Fire Insurance Indemnity Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Bureau Requesting that Foreign Merchants be Advised</p>
<p>Issuing Public Bonds to Increase Premiums</p>
<p>The Company Bears No Loss, Policyholders Share the Burden</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fire Insurance Indemnity Association, because foreign merchant fire insurance companies have not expressed their intention to handle public bonds in the same way as Chinese merchants, sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday requesting that it inform the Foreign Merchant Association to express its intention as soon as possible to avoid further disputes. The original letter is as follows: The dispute over fire insurance indemnity in the disaster area has lasted for more than half a year, and the impact on society has been noted by Chinese and foreign authorities. The previous tens of thousands of policyholders who formed a team to claim compensation have become a serious security issue. Fortunately, the patrol officers of your bureau have a deep understanding of the righteousness and are well aware of the plight of the policyholders. The team claims for compensation, which originally came from an unavoidable act, so they do not interfere arbitrarily, so as to avoid all kinds of misfortunes. The Association is also deeply grateful. However, in the face of the serious situation of the dispute, our government also believes that there should be a considerable solution, so it instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to effectively handle it. The Social Affairs Bureau then instructed the Insurance Association to discuss a concrete plan and report it for approval, and notified the Association to advise policyholders to suspend claims and wait for a solution. The instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau stated that the only way to resolve the dispute over fire insurance indemnity in the disaster area is to issue public bonds. Chinese insurance companies have now passed the principle of issuing public bonds at the members' meeting, but there has been no expression from the foreign merchants. The Association is deeply sorry to learn about it. After all, in the same commercial port and the same business, it should be unified, so that the credit of the commercial port will not be flawed. Moreover, although the funds for the principle of issuing public bonds are raised from the increase in premiums by Chinese and foreign insurance industries, they are actually used for policyholders, and they are still taken from policyholders. The insurance companies themselves have no donations, but they only spend a lot of effort. Moreover, by issuing public bonds to resolve this major dispute, the credibility of the insurance companies in the community and the feelings of the people can be infinitely increased. Therefore, the Association believes that this method is beneficial and harmless to the insurance industry. If this opportunity is missed and no solution is found, the Association's tens of thousands of disaster-stricken policyholders will inevitably restart disputes and take extreme measures. It is difficult to predict what extent it will reach in the future. From the perspective of the disaster victims, it is unbearably pitiful, and it is also difficult for the patrol officers of your bureau to deal with. The Association, in order to prepare for a rainy day, has to sincerely inform you, and especially asks your bureau to advise the foreign merchant fire insurance association to express its intention to handle the business in the same way as the Chinese merchant as soon as possible, so that there will be no more disturbances, and the local area will be fortunate.</p>
<p>Buying a Car Using a Forged Bank Draft</p>
<p>Ni Renqing Buys a Car and Frauds</p>
<p>Transfers a Check, Alters it, and Cashes it Out</p>
<p>Ni Renqing, a 54-year-old Shaoxing native residing at No. 7 Zhaoqing Lane, North Chengdu Road, Public Concession, claimed to the Xintong Automobile Company at No. 1 Albert Road, French Concession, last month that he wanted to buy a Chevrolet car. The agreed price was 3,000 taels. Ni immediately took out a forged bank draft for 500 taels, dated October 12th, and asked the car dealership to make change for 500 taels. The car dealership owner saw that Ni was generous and had a broad face, so he believed it to be true and signed a check for 500 taels to Dao-I Bank, dated October 16th. The date of the check differed from the date of the bank draft by four days. Unexpectedly, after Ni took back the check, he erased the "ten" on the 16th and changed it to "six," and then went to the bank to withdraw 500 taels for spending. When Xintong Automobile Company went to collect the money at maturity, they realized that it was a forgery and found that the 500 taels of checks they had issued had been defrauded. They reported it to the police station and sent investigator Yang Yilong to arrest Ni. He was escorted to the Second Special Court Criminal Division yesterday. The police station lawyer Yuan Jiaohuang said that the police station had not yet investigated the case and requested a change of date for another hearing. Judge Wu approved the request for a change of date for a continued hearing.</p>

<p>Dalu News reports: A Westerner, Peace Watts, planned to cycle around the world. After departing from Shanghai six months ago, he was denied entry to Canada and returned to Shanghai yesterday. But his ambition has not been extinguished, and he still hopes to continue his world tour. It is heard that Peace Watts first took a boat from Shanghai to Tianjin and then cycled to Shenyang.

However, although he carried a Yokohama British Consul passport and claimed to be British, he was ultimately rejected by the Canadian authorities and had to return to Shanghai by boat.</p>
<p>Municipal Public Security Bureau Revises the Resident Surety Method</p>
<p>Submits a Request to the Municipal Government for Review</p>
<p>The City's Housing Surety Method has always been based on the Regulations on Punishing Kidnappers. Since the order to abolish the Regulations on Punishing Bandits was issued in May of this year, this surety method has lost its basis. The Municipal Public Security Bureau drafted the Housing Lease Rules in September of the 17th year. Several articles required the landlord to be responsible. Because of opposition from all walks of life, the rules were ordered to be suspended. The Municipal Public Security Bureau is now aware that the surety method needs to be stipulated urgently. The proposed revision of the Draft of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Resident Surety Method is hereby submitted to the Municipal Government for review. The revision draft is as follows: (2) In order to eliminate bandits and maintain public security in this city, all residents of this city must seek proper security in accordance with the provisions of this method. (2) The resident surety method is as follows: 1. Store surety (those who have opened a store in the city for more than one year); 2. Resident surety (those who have lived in the city for more than one year and have a legitimate occupation; 3. Those who live in self-owned houses should submit the deed for inspection, or be certified by the map director and land protection officer, and be allowed to waive the surety, but those who are willing to follow the first and second items are allowed to listen; 4. Shanty towns and earthen houses should have a joint guarantee of five neighboring households; 5. Foreigners who have no guarantee may be certified by the consul in charge. If there is no treaty country, one overseas Chinese registered in the bureau guarantees it; 6. Party members and civil servants may be certified by the agency in charge and allowed to waive the guarantee; (3) The liability borne by the guarantor in the preceding paragraph is limited to harboring bandits and endangering public security; (4) When the landlord transfers the house to a tenant or subtenant (ie, second landlord, third tenant), regardless of whether it is a shop or a household, it should follow the provisions of Article 2 and order the tenant to seek security separately, or the landlord and subtenant will jointly guarantee and submit the guarantee certificate to the district office for filing; (5) If the guarantor has any changes in the place of guarantee or closes down, the guaranteed person should declare to the district office in charge and seek another guarantee; (6) If the guarantor does not want to guarantee the guaranteed person, he may declare to the district office in charge to withdraw the guarantee, and the district office in charge should order the guaranteed person to seek another guarantee at any time; (8) If the landlord or subtenant and transferor do not comply with this method, they may be punished in accordance with Article 34 of the Police Violation Law, and they will still be ordered to seek security. If there is still no security overdue, the district office in charge may report to the bureau for review; (9) If there is any unfinished matter in this method, it may be submitted for revision; (10) This method will be implemented from the date of approval by the Municipal Government.</p>

<p>Continued Hearing of the Ye Sanbao Assassination Case</p>
<p>Witnesses Summoned to Court for Questioning Yesterday</p>
<p>Ye Sanbao, a Yongren from Yang's house, Huayuan Shiqiao, Pudong, was shot and killed by Liu Mapi, a Shandong native who failed to borrow money. After being verified by the local court, yesterday, the court summoned the deceased's wife, Ye Ma, the owner of the trough workshop, Cai Heyun, and the barber shop Youtao, to court for questioning. When Ye was ambushed by Liu Mapi on the road, he was shot in the foot and fled into the trough workshop. Liu Mapi chased him and opened fire continuously, until he died on the threshold of the trough workshop. The barber shop next door heard the gunshots and opened the door to investigate. He also fired at them and quickly lay down, smashing a piece of glass, etc. The prosecutor ordered the deceased's wife to request the Public Security Bureau to arrest the case nearby for investigation.</p>
<p>Chen Meixiang Files for Divorce</p>
<p>Still Failed After Three Trials</p>
<p>Chen Meixiang, a woman from Ningbo, 21 years old this year, married Zhang Renying, the son of Zhang Dingan, a laundry shop owner at No. 377 West Asiamas Road, French Concession, four years ago. In the spring of last year, Chen Meixiang filed a lawsuit for divorce with the former French Public Office, represented by four lawyers, Jin Yu, Li Yuan, Shen Biao, and Liu Shiqi, because her husband abused prostitutes outside, causing her to contract syphilis, become blind, and be like a disabled person. The defendant Yinying was defended by lawyer Zhu Taiqing, and the judgment was that the evidence was insufficient and the case was rejected. Chen Meixiang refused to accept the judgment and still extended lawyer Jin and others to file an appeal with the High Court. The result was still executed according to the judgment. Chen Meixiang was still unwilling and extended lawyer Jin and others to file an appeal with the Supreme Court. After three trials, she still failed. It was judged that Chen Meixiang should still live with the accused and fulfill the obligations of husband and wife. This was at 10:30 a.m. yesterday when the Second Special Court Judge Cao Jun took office at the enforcement court and summoned both parties to court. After inquiring about the ages and origins of both parties, the plaintiff Chen Senxiang changed to lawyer Yan Luqing to represent her. She claimed that although the case had been rejected after three trials, according to the civil procedure of the Civil Code, personnel litigation could not be forcibly judged for execution. In short, the case was actually due to the fact that the accused Zhang Renying had deeply infected syphilis, so she requested a divorce. Moreover, the plaintiff gave birth to a son after marrying the defendant, who died shortly after childbirth. The child's body was smelly all over, which proved the cause of syphilis. When the accused Zhang Renying was examined in court last time, he injected a large number of 606914 detoxification agents in advance, making it impossible for the forensic doctor to verify it for a while, so the appraisal only stated that syphilis had not yet penetrated the brain nervous system and could be cured. However, according to the plaintiff's speculation, the defendant's syphilis had already been deeply rooted. It should be known that 606 and 514 can only cure temporarily, but cannot cure for a lifetime. The plaintiff has been in debt since the lawsuit, and there is no way to pay for living expenses in the future. He asked to order the</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Tragic Case of the Chao-Shan Railway Staff Member Killed <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Deceased Was Chief Accountant Zhong Lanrao</p>
<p>The Murderer, Xie Chuan Yan, Was Arrested in Hong Kong</p>
<p>After Being Taken Back to Shantou, He Admitted He Killed For Money</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Zhong Lanrao, chief of the accounting section of the Chao-Shan Railway Company, was a native of Meixian, 60 years old. He was known for his loyalty, diligence, simplicity, honesty, and gentleness, and was trusted by Zhang Rongxuan, the founder of the railway company. He had worked for the company for more than 20 years. Besides his regular office hours, Zhong would return to the company's main office at 6 PM every evening to clear accounts and count money until 7:30 PM, when he would go home for dinner. Sometimes he would return again, but it was not fixed. On the evening of October 20th, he had not returned home for dinner by 7 PM, causing his family to suspect something was wrong. At 10 PM that night, the railway police changed shifts. The guard on duty, Xu Heshang, handed over to Li Yaonan. Li inspected the doors and windows as usual to complete the handover procedure. Li noticed that the door at the back of the company, leading to the police office, was wide open. He and Xu Heshang entered the company's office to check and found bloodstains on the floor in front of the chief accountant's office, and the furniture was in disarray. They concluded that a murder had occurred. Li and Xu were horrified and ran back to the police station to report. Lanrao's son, Luchang, also an employee of the company, went to the police station because his father had not returned home for dinner. He asked the police to accompany him to search nearby. The station chief, Zhang Liang, immediately sent someone to report to the Public Security Bureau and accompanied many company employees to the board of directors to investigate. The Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched detective captain Chen Hanwen to lead a team to the scene. They found several bloodstains inside the accountant's office. The iron cabinet where the money was stored had been opened, and a company checkbook used for withdrawals from the bank and several other important accounting books were taken. 1,000 Singapore dollars in banknotes were missing, and the amount of other banknotes and cash taken was unknown. 150 silver dollars remained in the cabinet, and 250 dollars packed in a bamboo basket from the bank were still on the floor. Many silver dollars and coins were scattered on the floor and tables. On the newspaper stand outside the office, there was a heavy teak newspaper clip, two of which were broken, with the copper screws bent and blood and flesh smeared on them. Captain Chen immediately collected these items for evidence. He then searched the inside and outside of the company, and all the doors were intact, except for the surveillance room door, which was open, leading them to suspect that the murderer had escaped through this door. After repeated inspection, Chairman Lin Xinxin saw bloodstains on the water well door on the floor, with a Western-style dining knife next to it. He pried open the floor and found the body of Zhong Lanrao lying horizontally under the floor. His head was covered with a canvas bag used for holding money. When it was removed, the deceased had severe beating injuries to his brow, eyes, temples, and head. His neck and both hands were bruised and swollen. The death was extremely tragic, bringing tears to Chairman Lin's eyes. An investigation into Zhong's life revealed that he had never offended anyone. He never hesitated to advance monthly salaries or food allowances to his colleagues. He always locked his office door during office hours to prevent accidents and was always careful. This time, the murderer was able to break in and commit the crime. The deceased did not have the surveillance room key on him. How could the body be moved to the floor in that room and the hole in the floor be known unless it was premeditated? Captain Chen took the dining knife from the floor and saw that the water in the washbasins in the accounting office and surveillance room was bright red and smelled of blood, indicating that the murderer had washed himself there after committing the crime. It was clear that there were two or three accomplices. Before leaving, Captain Chen took six suspected employees, including Lin Hanming, Lin Jinzhen, Lin Xunpan, Lin Yaxing, Huang Haiqing, and Xu Heshang, to the police station for questioning. A pair of wooden clogs and a black cloth bib worn by the victim at the time were also taken away. On the 21st, the railway police station requested the court to send personnel for an autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased's injuries were caused by being beaten to death with a stick or nail. Before death, he was unable to resist or struggle. At 2 PM that afternoon, the board of directors held a meeting and decided to petition the government to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice to appease the spirit of the deceased.</p>
<p>Afterwards, police detectives from the Public Security Bureau learned that a strange man had moved from the Sihai Hotel to the Asia Hotel and then fled to Hong Kong the next day with a large amount of Hong Kong dollars. The hotel immediately dispatched detective Yao Bingkun to secretly investigate in Hong Kong with the help of railway company staff. They found Xie Chuan Yan and the prostitute Bi Jun, who had fled with him that day, renting a room on the sixth floor of the Emperor Hotel. The detectives immediately invited secret detectives stationed in Hong Kong to rush to the hotel to surround and arrest them. They first guarded the entrance. Two assistant detectives and one extradition committee member also arrived one after another. They entered the room to arrest them and reported to the Hong Kong government, which sent personnel to investigate. At first, they did not believe that Xie Chuan Yan had committed murder for money. However, a pair of cloth shoes stained with blood were found in Xie's luggage. With this evidence, the Hong Kong government agreed to extradition. On the 25th, the detectives escorted Xie Chuan Yan back to Shantou on the Chaozhou steamer and handed him over to the Public Security Bureau Detention Center. At 8 AM on the 26th, he was interrogated at the Detective Team Headquarters. He admitted that he had committed the murder for money at the Shantou Railway Company alone and had no accomplices. He said to just execute him by firing squad. He confessed that around 5 PM on the 20th, after the company staff had left work, only the last train from Chaozhou to Shantou remained. Because his father, Xie Liangyuan, was a major shareholder of the company, he went to the office and told the accounting section chief, Zhong Lanrao, that his father wanted to withdraw money. Zhong replied that a company note was required to do so. At the time, he needed the money urgently, so he asked where the money was hidden. Zhong replied that it was in the iron safe. He intended to open it, but Zhong locked the safe. So he picked up a newspaper clip and struck Zhong on the head three times. Zhong fainted to the ground. Fearing that Zhong would raise an alarm, he gagged him with a money bag and struck him again with the newspaper clip, accidentally hitting his eye, causing blood to gush out. He then went to the floor under the surveillance room, washed the blood off his hands, opened the safe, and took 1,000 Hong Kong dollars and about 3,000-4,000 yuan in Shantou notes. However, he lost the 1,000 Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong, which he reported to the Hong Kong government for record. According to reports, Xie Chuan Yan's original name was Qianji, and he was from Songkou, Meixian. He was an extravagant spender and often associated with women. Because he had committed crimes in Nanyang several times, his father had hired a lawyer to publish a statement disowning him. In September, he committed another crime in Hong Kong and was deported to Shantou by the Hong Kong government. He lived in the Sihai Hotel and was deeply in love with a prostitute named Bi Fei. When his money ran out, he conceived a wicked plan. When he was taken back to Shantou, he was wearing a Western suit and showed no remorse. As for the seven employees and police officers, including Gu Wukun, who were implicated in the case and detained by the Public Security Bureau, they have now been released as they were not involved in the case (October 26).</p>

<p>A'sheng, the daughter of farmer Gu Binggen from the seventh district of Fengxian County, was run over and killed by a dark green car on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road in Yaojiahang, Nantao section, on the 16th of last month. The case was reported to the county Public Security Bureau, which sent a letter to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to investigate. However, due to an error in the car number, the case remained unsolved. It is now learned from a report that the car involved in the accident is No. 11663 from the Fada Automobile Company on Avenue Joffre, Shanghai. On the 22nd, the informant, accompanied by the township head of Yao, went to the company to investigate and confirmed the report. They immediately reported back to the Public Security Bureau, which sent county inspector Chen Jinfang to negotiate. Without result, the county government, acting as the judiciary, prepared a document to the relevant police station and the Special District Court this morning, requesting extradition for legal action.</p>

<p>There are more than 300 barbershops and 1,400 barbers in and outside Wuxi, mainly from Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, with barbers from Wuxi accounting for only a small number. Two years ago, they organized a trade association in accordance with regulations and established rules that were jointly observed. Last month, a new and well-equipped barber shop, Dahua Barbershop, opened on Hanchang Road and its business boomed. As a result, barbershops along the street were affected and began to compete by lowering prices. However, barbershops other than those on the street believed this would undermine the overall situation and hinder business, and they unanimously opposed it. They requested the trade association to intervene, reorganize the industry rules, and prevent barbershops on the street from freely lowering prices. The barbers also agreed with the shop owners and unanimously requested action. The trade association tried to persuade the barbershops on the street to voluntarily cancel the price reductions on the morning of the 1st to avoid harming the industry's harmony, but after half a day of efforts, there was no result. In the afternoon, the barbershops in the urban area became very angry, gathered together, and went on strike at 5 PM, intending to negotiate with the barbershops on the street that were lowering prices. However, those shops had already received the news and immediately closed their doors. That evening, a general meeting was held at the trade association, and the county party headquarters was requested to make a fair judgment. Yesterday morning, all the barbershops in the city remained closed. The county government ordered the county Public Security Bureau and its branches to send police to strictly suppress any disturbances. The county party headquarters also sent a cadre, Gao Zugao, to guide and mediate, hoping for a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Slaughter Tax Dispute Resolved <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>In Wuxi, the slaughter tax in the urban area has always been contracted by the Meat Industry Association to the Tax Collection Office, with a quota of 226 pigs slaughtered per day. However, since last year's flood, followed by difficulties in contracting and a sluggish market, the meat industry has been particularly affected, and many have requested a reduction in the contracted quota. The newly appointed director of the Tax Collection Office, Yu Jigong, insisted on adhering to the quota. After two months of negotiations and mediation by the Chamber of Commerce, the two sides remained deadlocked. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce invited the county government, the education, construction, and public security bureaus, as well as the slaughterhouse, tax collection office, county treasury, and representatives of the meat industry, to conduct a final mediation. After lengthy negotiations, all parties reached an understanding and a decision was made: (1) The slaughter tax in the urban area will be temporarily calculated at 120 pigs slaughtered per day for one year, starting from the establishment of the new Tax Collection Office on September 16. The tax rate will remain at 4 jiao for the provincial education tax, 1 jiao for the county education surtax, and 5 fen for the construction special tax per pig. (2) This measure will be implemented immediately. Unpaid taxes will be paid daily before December 16. (3) Taxes before the establishment of the new Tax Collection Office on September 16, totaling three and a half months, should be negotiated by the industry after December 16 and paid in installments. The above three measures have been sent to all parties for information.</p>

<p>All the wine merchants in the county have suspended brewing for many days due to the fact that Gao Xi, the director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Office, increased the quota from 20,150 yuan to 27,800 yuan, which imposes excessive taxes on the distilleries. The distilleries are unable to bear the burden. The wine merchants, represented by the trade association's Zhuo Ting and Liu Daosheng, have decided to pay the taxes directly to the treasury, to counter the situation.

<p>The teachers and staff of various schools in the urban and rural areas resigned to demand their salaries, but there were no gatherings, coercion, parades, or demonstrations. However, Director Zhu Bofu falsely reported to the education department and ordered the county to arrest teachers, which caused a wave of unrest. The county district party department summoned the teachers and staff to a meeting to advise and persuade them, and followed the instructions of the provincial department to mediate and make three decisions: (1) The county party department will send a letter to the county government ordering the education bureau to announce detailed accounts within three days of receiving the letter, and at the same time send all receipts along with the list to the supervisory committee office for review, and request the provincial party department and education department to send personnel to conduct a joint liquidation. (2) For overdue salaries, a concrete plan for compensation and guarantees must be determined. (3) This week, all teachers and staff should resume their duties and attend classes as usual. The county party department will jointly inspect the situation with the county government and report it to the provincial department.</p>

<p>Farmers Fei Jinkui and his wife, Zhou, were working in the fields in Nanfuhangfang the other day, when two British employees of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, who were on vacation, brought guns to hunt. They fired a shot in the fields for no reason, hitting the Fei couple, who both fell to the ground and were in critical condition. The villagers immediately gathered around and took custody of the British nationals. The British nationals immediately took out banknotes to try to buy their freedom, but the crowd refused. They escorted the two criminals who injured the people to the county. Interrogator Qu opened the court to interrogate them. The British nationals, one named Martin and the other named Mating, admitted that they had injured people while playing around. During the confession, they also took off their rings and gave them to the interrogating official, who reprimanded them. In the midst of confusion, the interrogating official suddenly remembered the weapon and ordered it to be presented for inspection. A bailiff brought the gun, but it was not locked, and there was a bullet in the chamber. With a loud bang, the roof of the court was shattered, and splinters fell on the head of Fei Jinkui, who was already injured, leaving him unable to speak. Interrogator Qu ordered the Fei couple to be sent to the hospital and the two criminals to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>Sun Dafu, the village head of Qiannancun in Jinjiadou, a place in the northern suburbs of this city, is a man of modest means, and he was coveted by bandits. On the night of October 30, several bandits, speaking with a Henan accent and armed with pistols and Mauser pistols, broke into his house. When Dafu heard the alarm, he opened the door and fled. His second son, Jin Fu, was unable to escape and was captured by the bandits, who beat him with iron rulers and burned him to force him to reveal where the silver was hidden. Jin Fu had no choice but to tell them, and all the silver, jewelry, clothes, and silk were stolen, resulting in a loss of nearly a thousand yuan. Jin Fu was severely injured and was taken to Wuxing Hospital in this city for treatment yesterday.</p>

<p>Sun Yat-sen University Ranks First in the Country</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties Make It Difficult to Implement Plans</p>
<p>Chen Jianxiao, the special commissioner for higher education in Guangdong appointed by the Ministry of Education, returned to Beijing last week. A reporter from the Minzu News Agency met him yesterday and inquired about the education situation in Guangzhou. Chen said that South China's culture is centered in Guangzhou, which is known for its development. However, it is located in a remote corner and is rarely noticed by the people of the country. Even Sun Yat-sen University, which was founded by Sun Yat-sen himself, was named after Sun Yat-sen after his death to commemorate him. In recent years, due to the right people in charge, its style has not changed, and its academic foundation has been greatly strengthened. In addition to the original colleges of arts, engineering, law, agriculture, and medicine, the university has also established research institutes for chemistry, economics, education, bacteriology, anatomy, physiology, pathology, and other subjects. Many professors have a spirit of research, and various facilities, such as libraries, machines, and specimens, have reached a considerable level. The colleges of agriculture and medicine are particularly large in scale. They are affiliated with agricultural fields covering about 10,000 mu, a model forest farm, a second forest farm, a first hospital, a second hospital, and a branch library of the medical college. The methods are all based on the German system, and most of the professors are also German. This is a unique feature of medical education in our country. Regarding the funding of Sun Yat-sen University, Chen also gave a detailed answer to the reporter. He said that before the 19th year of the Republic (1930), the Guangdong Finance Special Commissioner's Office allocated 140,000 yuan per month for expenses, which was barely enough. Last year, due to the plan to add departments of civil engineering and industrial chemistry and increase the salaries of professors, it was specially approved that the Ministry of Finance would allocate an additional 45,000 yuan per month for recurring expenses starting in September of the 20th year of the Republic (1931). Also, for the construction of the school buildings of the College of Agriculture, which requires approximately 886,000 yuan of national currency, it was also approved by the National Government that 30,000 yuan would be allocated by the central government per month, until it was fully allocated. The above two sums totaled 75,000 yuan per month, but since last year, only 228,000 yuan has actually been received, which has caused considerable difficulties. In addition, the university previously spent a great deal of money on purchasing books and instruments from abroad, due to the high price of gold. The students had to pay more fees due to the difficult social economy, and other administrative expenses were reduced. Therefore, it is difficult to implement all the proactive plans. As for the content, personnel, and administration of the university, Chen also briefly mentioned a few people. In terms of the number of students, Sun Yat-sen University ranks first among the universities in the country. The university headquarters has about 1,800 students, plus the students in kindergartens, elementary schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools, there are a total of more than 4,000 students. The total number of faculty and staff is more than 500. Since President Zou arrived, many changes have been made. Three-fifths of the deans have been replaced. The director of academic affairs, the director of the library, the director of accounting, the director of general affairs, the director of registration, the director of the farm, the director of the forest farm, the director of the hospital, the director of the senior high school, and the director of the junior high school have all been changed. The secretary-general and the six or seven secretaries are all newly appointed. More other faculty and staff have left. President Zou seems to be very enthusiastic in his work and has administrative talents. He has revised various regulations and changed the professors' contracts. All power is concentrated in the president and the director of academic affairs, and these measures seem to be more convenient, but they lose the spirit of professors governing the school and will make professors not participate in school affairs except for teaching. Chen did not say that he lived in Guangzhou for ten days before and after, most of the time, in addition to giving lectures at the Provincial Education Association and various schools, he inspected Sun Yat-sen University, especially the farm and medical school, which he visited in detail each time costing him at least four or five hours. The result was very satisfactory. President Zou also handed him a letter to Minister Zhu, asking him to deliver it on his behalf, in the hope that Sun Yat-sen University would be issued the funds approved last year. This matter is of great importance to the future of Sun Yat-sen University, and he intends to urge the government to pay attention to it. In addition, there are Lingnan University, National University, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou Law School, and Xia Ge Medical School in Guangzhou, all of which are private educational institutions. Chen has visited them all. He said that each school has a long history and has been run diligently to this day. The original intentions of the founders are commendable, but the land in Guangzhou is expensive, and the cost of purchasing land and building school buildings is already high, so there is little remaining to enrich the facilities. In terms of facilities, few schools have facilities that are satisfactory. This is probably inevitable. However, Lingnan University was founded by foreigners and has a basic scale, and Xia Ge is also run by foreigners, and its buildings and equipment are quite rich. These are exceptions. Most of the students in each school are diligent in their studies, and the school spirit is becoming more and more disciplined, unlike it was a few years ago. These are all good signs. The reporter believes that Chen's remarks are very detailed and records them for those who are concerned about education in South China.</p>
