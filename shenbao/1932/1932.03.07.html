<h3 id="c1">國聯之最近形勢 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>觀日内瓦五日電訊。國聯今日之會議。雖甚激昻。各小國代表。雖皆盡量發言。力主維護國聯會章之尊嚴。但其結果。尙須待七日之續開會議。是則七日之續會。必將有更重大之辨論。而國聯會章之是否能實行維護。中日問題是否有適當之解决。又將視此會之結果矣。五日會議中。西班牙代表所發表之三種辦法。最爲切要。㈠議會責任所在。應聲明會章要求。先撤兵而後談判。㈡議會須使人勿忘會章第十條乃國聯之最高憲章。（三）國聯會章。應特别使之有力。以援助弱小之國家。蓋非此無以解决中日間之糾紛。且無以維持國聯本身之地位。及凱洛格公約與九國公約之尊嚴。再進而言之。更無以鞏固其軍縮會議之基礎。試觀今日英國評論之評論報主筆史梯德在星期泰晤士報所登討論遠東時局之論文。謂美國近已有一種諷示。如日本繼續破壞凱洛格公約與九國公約。則美國定在斐列濱與甘姆島大興防禦工程。此種發展。如果有之。則美國海軍定將大增。而英國亦將被同迫樣擴大海軍。除非英國願意放棄英美海軍平等之原則耳。若此原則果放棄之則澳洲紐絲倫與西加拿大。勢必於美日間發生戰事時。仰賴美國海軍之保護云云。即可知此次中日問題關係之大。牽連之廣。而國聯之處理此事。尤不可不特别鄭重者也。上海事件</p>

<p>代表間多主張經濟制裁</p>
<p>討論完畢將有總决議案</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日國聯議會集議時、言論頗爲激昻、故英代表西門有一次發言、請求終止會塲中之敵對行爲、會塲之擾攘、大都由中日代表長期舌戰而起、迨爭辯旣止而討論復作時、空氣始較寗靖、午後會議係四時三刻開始、當時即有報名欲發言者八人、大都爲小國代表、其所言者、甚爲直率、痛詆日本、其中有三人表示欲用經濟制裁之意、但討論未畢、而議會又告休會、展至三月七日復開、以致未再提出議案、</p>

<p>瑞士代表摩太取國聯會章各項條文之含義作詳細之分析、並謂、敵對行爲之發作、已越過會章第十五條所載偶然事故之外、但此條會章先載有和解手續、渠意在此手續下、尙有可望成功之良好理由、用此手續、可使此條會章第二段之敵用爲非必要、渠希望與會諸國在調停手續不用完時、各遵守不偏袒之態度、一方面佈置解决方法、一方面準備解决不成時所應採之手續、渠提議組織股員會、研究爭端中全部原因、而報告於議會、摩太詳言違約國在會章第十五條第二段下所須受極嚴重之後果後、謂各小國如對於和平手續之機關、喪失信任、則爲勢所迫、將用他法、以保障其安全、故小國在目前危局中、應表示其團結云、</p>

<p>西班牙代表蘇魯太發言、表示國聯會施用會章全部力量解决目前爭端以符世界期望之希望、並謂現有三種辦法㈠議會責任所在、應聲明會章要求先撤兵而後談判㈡議會須使人勿忘會章第十條乃國聯之最高憲章、㈢國聯會章應特别使之有力、以應付組織未充分之國家云、捷克代表皮恩士稱、渠不欲在此爭執中有所偏護、捷克未忘中日兩國在大戰中所予之友好援助、渠意兩國須知國聯議會現所行者、亦即議會對於任何他國案件所應行者、國聯必須完全履行其職務、現當考慮者、誠有特殊情形、但無論如何、國聯會章必須爲人尊重、渠深以爲憾者、日本未首先將此爭點提交國聯云、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Recent Situation of the League of Nations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Geneva, 5th - A dispatch reports that today's meeting of the League of Nations, though quite激昂(stirring/intense), saw representatives of various small nations speaking at length, strongly advocating for the upholding of the dignity of the League of Nations charter. However, the outcome still awaits the adjourned meeting on the 7th. This adjourned meeting on the 7th is bound to feature even more significant debates, and whether the League of Nations charter can be effectively upheld and whether the Sino-Japanese issue can be appropriately resolved will depend on the outcome of this meeting. During the meeting on the 5th, the three proposals put forward by the Spanish representative were the most crucial: (1) The responsibility of the assembly lies in declaring that the charter requires the prior withdrawal of troops before negotiations. (2) The assembly must not allow people to forget that Article 10 of the charter is the highest constitution of the League of Nations. (3) The League of Nations charter should be made particularly forceful to assist smaller nations. Otherwise, it will be impossible to resolve the dispute between China and Japan, maintain the standing of the League of Nations itself, and uphold the dignity of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. Furthermore, it will be impossible to solidify the foundation of the disarmament conference. Consider the commentary in today's British Review's editorial by史梯德(Stead), chief editor of the Review of Reviews, published in The Sunday Times discussing the Far Eastern situation. It states that the United States has recently offered a hint: if Japan continues to violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, the United States will definitely undertake large-scale defense projects in the Philippines and Guam. If such a development occurs, the United States Navy will undoubtedly increase significantly, and Britain will be forced to expand its navy in the same way, unless Britain is willing to abandon the principle of Anglo-American naval equality. If this principle is indeed abandoned, Australia, New Zealand, and Western Canada will inevitably rely on the protection of the United States Navy in the event of war between the United States and Japan. This shows the great significance and broad implications of the current Sino-Japanese issue, and the League of Nations must handle this matter with particular solemnity. Shanghai Incident</p>

<p>Jiang Guangnai, Commander-in-Chief of the Nineteenth Route Army, in order to respect the League of Nations ceasefire resolution, specifically issued orders to all officers and soldiers yesterday, stating: Now that the League of Nations General Assembly has resolved to request both China and Japan to implement a ceasefire, we should comply accordingly. If the Japanese army does not attack us, our army will not attack them either. If the Japanese army violates the League of Nations resolution and launches an attack, our army must still resist. All officers and soldiers must comply accordingly.</p>

<p>Greatly Defeated the Japanese Army the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The rear office of the Nineteenth Route Army stationed in Shanghai received a telegram from Chief of Staff Zhao at 4:00 PM yesterday, stating: On微日(May 5th), the enemy fiercely attacked Huangdu, Jiading, and Loutang. At the same time, dozens of aircraft dropped hundreds of bombs on major townships along the railway line in Suzhou and Kunshan. Shangguan Yunxiang led the □□□ division to assist and greatly defeated the enemy. A portion retreated towards Baijia Bridge, and some are still in fierce fighting.</p>

<p>Battles at Loutang and Other Places Suzhou, 6th Special Telegram: Reports of the enemy landing at Hupu in Changshu and the robbery at Jiaozhi between Suzhou and Kunshan are inaccurate.

<p>□□ Officer Wu of the artillery battalion was at the front line, leading by example. He was wounded in the left wrist by a machine gun stray bullet and came to Shanghai for treatment. The injury is not very serious. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency met Wu at a certain hospital. According to him, the □□□ division of Shangguan Yunxiang's troops and the □□□ division of Xu Yuanquan's troops will be distributed to the front lines. Our troops are now defending Qingyang Port, planning to defend it defensively and seek opportunities for counterattack. Commander Cai's intention is that the Nineteenth Route Army will only resist to the end, even to the last soldier. They will never become a second Ma Zhanshan. They only hope that after the Nineteenth Route Army, there will be countless Nineteenth Route Armies to follow. Then the officers and soldiers who have died in battle since the beginning of the war will surely take pride in dying first. The reporter asked what the front line needed. Battalion Commander Wu said that the front line now needs shallow-water steamboats. If the public is willing to donate, please send them to the rear office. He repeatedly urged the reporter to appeal to the public that when enemy planes come, they must not gather and watch, because as soon as enemy planes find a target, they will frantically drop bombs. Such senseless sacrifice is not only unfortunate for those who are hit but also detrimental to military operations.</p>

The original text is as follows: (Titles omitted) Your telegrams have been read. In the Battle of Shanghai, your department defended the territory and resisted the invaders, fighting fiercely for a month, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's fierce attacks. Your bravery and strength have spread far and wide, but due to the enemy's superiority in numbers, you had to await reinforcements and retreat from the front lines to plan another counterattack. Reading your statement, we feel indignant. We hope that you will maintain the spirit of sacrificing yourself to save the country and strive for continued efforts. With your department's skill in battle and the public's unity, the final victory will still belong to us. We have dispatched Comrades Guan Suren and Cui Guangxiu to the front lines to offer comfort and support on our behalf. The Southwest Political Affairs Committee sings.</p>

<p>The Special District Citizens' Federation sent Liu Zhongying and Wu Banqiao at 3:00 PM yesterday, hiring a boat to Suzhou and then to the headquarters of the Nineteenth Route Army and the Fifth Army to comfort and support the soldiers in battle. The慰勞(comfort) goods included a victory flag, cotton quilts, woolen shirts and trousers, etc. The letter addressed to the officers and soldiers of each army is recorded below. Respectfully to Commander-in-Chief Jiang, Commander Cai, Commander Zhang, all division, brigade, and regimental commanders, and all soldiers: Since you, the commanders, led the soldiers who defend the country, sacrificing blood and flesh to resist the brutal enemy, your reputation has spread, and the world is shocked. It has shown the outside world that our country cannot be insulted and proved domestically that the brutal Japanese are not invincible. The result of this more than month-long war is that it has factually revealed a new record in the comparison of military strength in the world: the value of warships, aircraft, heavy artillery, armored vehicles, and 利器(sophisticated weapons) is far less than that of soldiers with patriotic courage and a spirit of sacrifice. (Middle section omitted) We have sent Liu Zhongying, Wang Zhaocheng, Yu Yuqing, and Zhang Zilian four people (temporarily changed to Liu Zhongying and Wu Banqiao two people) as representatives to go to the front lines to present flags and express our condolences. As for future support, arrangements have already been made. We earnestly request that you, the commanders, implement your bloodthirsty determination to resist the enemy to the end, do your best, and strive for survival. The people's hearts have not died, and we will surely achieve the final victory. Tears fall as we express ourselves incompletely.</p>

<p>The union telegraphed the Second Plenary Session yesterday, stating: The esteemed members of the Second Plenary Session in Luoyang, your telegram is understood. After the Shanghai Incident, the Nineteenth Route Army fought bravely to resist, and the people destroyed their homes and emptied their houses, managing to hold out for more than a month. Although the government has repeatedly declared its resistance, except for a small portion of the troops who were motivated by righteous indignation and automatically participated in the war, we have not heard of our government sending a single soldier or bullet. The孤軍(isolated army) in battle ultimately retreated in pain due to lack of support. This is all due to the cowardice and耽誤(negligence) of our government. Now that the enemy寇(bandits/invaders) is increasingly urgent, the government officials are逍遙(at ease) in Luoyang, still ignoring the孤軍(isolated army). What kind of heart is this? It makes people feel like they are being torn apart. If you still want to be Chinese citizens, please immediately dispatch heavy troops. An urgent telegram full of grief. Please act quickly.

<p>The Special District Party Department of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Union cabled Luoyang, saying: Most urgent. Respectfully to the Second Plenary Session: Ever since the brutal Japanese invaded Shanghai, our Nineteenth Route Army, together with the Fifth Army, has fought bloodily for a month, repeatedly defeating a strong enemy. Only because the 孤軍(isolated army) was without reinforcements was it forced to retreat. Shanghai is a major port in the East, the center of the nation's culture, society, and economy. If it falls into the hands of the Japanese, not only will the lives and property of all citizens in the city be trampled upon, but the international standing will also be affected. Thinking of this, we are filled with grief. We earnestly hope that you will immediately dispatch heavy troops to recover the lost territory. Do not engage in empty talk and sit idly by and watch without providing assistance. All of our seamen party members have undiminished blood and vigor. As long as a breath remains, we will surely resist the Japanese imperialists in the spirit of past struggles and cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the 危亡(peril). We earnestly request that you quickly determine a plan to resist Japan, recover Shanghai, and討代(substitute) for the Northeast. The urgent telegram is full of pressing anxiety.</p>

<p>The 大陸報(Continental News) reported that the central district and Hongkou fire brigades of the public concession drove to Zhabei yesterday (5th) to extinguish the remaining fires. From morning to dusk, they continuously浇灌(watered/poured) for 14 hours. The leather belts were connected from the concession to the fire ground, nearly a mile long. According to the firefighters, what they saw along the way was not only dilapidated walls but also decaying corpses and scorched wax, half-buried among them. It was heartbreaking to witness. Even more tragic was that ordinary poor people were unable to escape and were hiding in their homes, with their food cut off and starving to death. One elderly merchant, along with a young child, was hiding at home, barely surviving on melon seeds these days.</p>

<p>Japanese Army Defense Line Roughly The 字林報(North China Daily News) reported that since the Japanese cavalry was運(transported) to Shanghai, yesterday was the first time it was used on a large scale, sending patrols along the front line to replace the infantry. The cavalry of the 11th Division stationed inside the transport ships were transferred to the蕴藻浜(Yunzaobang) by small輪(steamer) yesterday (5th). By dusk, 1,500 men and horses had landed, and it was heard that the navy currently located on the right wing of the Japanese army and in Zhabei would also be replaced by cavalry. Currently, the headquarters of the 9th Division is located in Nanxiang, and its light artillery line extends northward behind the infantry line, reaching north of Jiading. The heavy artillery, including six-inch cannons, is located in the Zhenru area. The artillery commander is located near南大學(National South East University). The line from Jiading to Liuhe is assigned to the 11th Division. The Japanese army has also set up a temporary airfield near Zhenru.

The original text of the telegram is as follows: Respectfully to Dr. Yan Huiqing, Chinese Representative to Geneva: The opening of the special meeting, the hard work is commendable. For the sake of maintaining true peace, the principle of maintaining the integrity of territorial sovereignty should be adhered to. Therefore, the prerequisite must be that Japan withdraw all its troops stationed in China. Otherwise, our people will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and will fight to the end as the government's backing. We hope you will continue to work hard for the country and贯澈(implement) the principle from beginning to end. The urgent telegram is filled with anticipation.

<p>The Cotton Cloth Association issued a notice to all members today, stating: Respectfully, the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce dated March 2nd opened (middle section omitted) and other matters. The meeting was submitted to the 25th Executive Committee meeting yesterday for discussion. It was unanimously agreed that since business has been slow and commissions are very difficult, the association should initiate national crisis monthly donations as follows: (1) The association will donate洋(Yuan) 300 per month. (2) Members will donate洋(Yuan) monthly, divided into four levels: (A) Above 100, (B) Above 50, (C) Above 20, (D) Above 2. (3) Employees used by each member should donate at least 5% of their monthly salary. Chen Songyuan, Li Xuechang, Wu Junhao, and Wu Bingtai, four members, were publicly elected as custodians and responsible for保管(safekeeping), etc., as discussed and decided upon. Considering that the national crisis is imminent, if the entire nation does not work together and resist for a long time, it will be difficult to survive. The corresponding record is hereby sent to you, hoping that you will enthusiastically determine the level of monthly donation and encourage your current employees to donate generously. Please reply to the association within three days for registration. Do not view this lightly. This is what we urgently hope for. We wish you prosperity.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Please Leave the Central Committee in Shanghai United Against External Forces <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>It is better to take action than to talk about it.</p>
<p>The China Self-Salvation Association in this city was initiated by patriotic人士(people) in Shanghai and is progressing quite actively. It has established a meeting place at No. 7 Qunyi Lane, Ningbo Road. The association,鉴于(in view of) the occurrence of the Shanghai Incident and the urgency of the national crisis, believes that being united against external forces is the only way to save the situation. Yesterday, it specifically sent a letter to the Central Committee in Shanghai, saying: Respectfully, you have been circling Shanghai, issuing repeated correct arguments and鞭策(spurring on) the authorities. Your words are long and your hearts are heavy. We admire you very much. However, during this Second Plenary Session, which will be held in Luoyang to determine the three-party plan for safeguarding the country and resisting insults, the government will be authorized to implement it. You are all members of the Central Committee, or concurrently serve in specialized positions. It seems that you should gather together in the capital to discuss things in one hall, so that comrades can understand each other and turn your usual proposals into resolutions of the plenary session. Then, action will be taken instead of just talking about it, which will benefit the national plan. Otherwise, it will be close to each setting up their own banner, only causing suspicion among comrades and giving outsiders cause for speculation. In this situation, if you want to lead the people and unite against external forces, isn't that going in the opposite direction and getting the opposite effect? In the late Southern Song Dynasty and the late Ming Dynasty, the朝論(court opinions) fought against each other, leading to the覆(destruction) of their宗社(state/empire). You are familiar with history and should know the lessons. The situation is urgent. The bandits are deep. The Northeast has been沦陷(occupied) for half a year, and the half of the Southeast is hardly a paradise. Is this the time for you to engage in勾心鬥角(infighting) and compete for意氣(temper)? Our association,鉴于(in view of) the disaster of the collapse of the棟(main beam) and the fall of the 榱(rafters), dares to weep and say this. If you adopt this suggestion, the four hundred million citizens will benefit.</p>

<h3 id="e21">American Boycott of Japanese Goods <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Number of Participants Has Reached One Million</p>
<p>The 大陸報(Continental News) carried an argument yesterday (6th), which roughly stated: While the League of Nations is struggling to devise effective ways to stop Japan's aggression against China, a private telegram flew across the Pacific yesterday, reporting that the American boycott of Japanese goods is like a spring tide, surging and progressing rapidly. This movement was initiated on February 19 by former Army Chief of Staff Baker, Harvard University President Dr. Lowell, and Harvard University Business Administration Research Institute Professor Dr. Haas. As the American anger towards the Japanese warlords increases daily, within just a week, the number of people signing petitions to the U.S. government to implement a boycott of Japanese goods reached 105,000. According to yesterday's private telegram, the number of people joining the boycott of Japanese goods has reached one million. They will not purchase Japanese goods again until Japan abandons the use of war as a tool for conducting national policy in China. After the Chinese people boycotted Japanese goods, the recent investigation report by the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry has shown how significant the damage to Japanese goods is and how British and American goods are replacing Japanese goods. Its shipments to Hong Kong decreased by 33% in 1931 compared to 1930 and by 39% compared to 1929. Shipments to China decreased by 40% in 1931 compared to 1930 and by 50% compared to 1929. Taking last winter as an example, September decreased by 33% compared to the same period last year, October decreased by 60%, and December decreased by 80%. (Middle section omitted) Japan's exports to the United States account for 40% to 45% of its total exports, and its imports from the United States account for about 30% of its total imports. Its exports to China, including Hong Kong and the three northeastern provinces, are less than 30% of its total exports, and its imports from China account for only 18% of its total imports. Therefore, the prosperity of its commerce depends on the United States far more than on trade with China. For example, the United States absorbs 90% of Japan's raw silk production. In recent months, although the price of Japanese silk in New York has fallen to an unprecedented record, sales have still decreased sharply. Last month, a U.S. message was received stating that all merchant ships sailing from Oakland to the Far East were包定(booked) by Japanese merchants to load American cotton for a month, perhaps the Japanese are planning for a rainy day. News from London and Tokyo stated that Americans have a 不親善(unfriendly) attitude towards the Japanese banking and business community, demanding payment of overdue debts. According to the famous Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, American financiers are now gradually tending to refuse to accommodate Japanese financiers in New York. Many American foreign traders are hesitating to order Japanese goods. Before this commercial fatigue, Japan annually sold goods worth 900 million Japanese Yen to the United States, exceeding the total value of American goods purchased by about 250 million Yen. This year, Japanese commerce is in an even more unfavorable position, as the excess of imports over exports in January and February has reached 80 million Japanese Yen. In the same period last year, the excess of imports over exports was only 5 million. (Bottom section omitted)</p>

<p>Reported to U.S. Consulate for Protest</p>
<p>The 字林報(North China Daily News) reported that the Shunde Women's School, run by the Southern Baptist Convention, located at 6 Rue Paul Beau, had the American Miss Ma Luowei of the school and the American pastor Tie Pu Dun return to the school to inspect on Friday morning. Upon arriving at the school, they saw that many windows and doors were broken, the什物(belongings) were messy, and there was a hole in the patio wall, with a leather belt leading water outwards. When the leather belt was cut, several plainclothes Japanese men wearing white armbands entered the room. At the time, only the lady was alone. One Japanese man suddenly struck her several times with a cane, and another Japanese man punched the lady in the face. Later, a Japanese man who could speak English came and asked the lady for her name and nationality. Only then was she allowed to leave the school. It is heard that the lady has reported to the American Consul General and asked him to file a protest. Now, due to excessive nervous stimulation, she has taken the President Coolidge with her sister to Hong Kong yesterday morning (5th) to recuperate.</p>
<p>The National News Agency Washington, 5th - A telegram from Washington stated that the U.S. Department of State has received the telegram about the Japanese浪人(ruffians) in Shanghai beating the American lady Ma Luowei. The final decision will be made after receiving a detailed report from the American Consul General in Shanghai, Kerginham. However, it may also temporarily assign the case to the consulate for handling. According to a person in the Department of State, although the Japanese authorities apologized for the case of the Japanese浪人(ruffians) beating Lin Huaide, an official of the American Consulate in Shanghai, it has not yet been considered resolved.</p>

<p>Red Swastika Society Relief Team Departs: The Red Swastika Society of this city, due to the serious situation in Suzhou and Kunshan, urgently telegraphed the East Asia Relief Team, which was staying in Beijing at the General Association, to depart for Suzhou to implement relief. At the same time, it urged the Southeast Third Relief Team, organized in Nanjing, and the Second Relief Team, organized in Wuhu, to depart for Changzhen and other places as soon as possible to work jointly with the Beijing General Relief Team. It is currently receiving a reply telegram from the Beijing Association that the General Relief Team, led by Team Leader Cao [blank], with more than 30 doctors and staff, will depart for Suzhou [blank] to take charge of front-line work. The Second and Third Teams will also depart for Changzhen in the near future to jointly prepare all rear relief work with the Red Swastika Societies of Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang. The Wuxi Red Swastika Society, due to the sudden outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, with refugees flocking to Wuxi, specially organized two reception centers to accommodate more than 5,000 refugees from the war zone, and sends hundreds of foreign refugees out of the country every day. The Changzhou Red Swastika Society has also established a reception center at Qingliang Temple, which has already accommodated more than 60 refugees.</p>

<p>Red Cross Runs Fourth Reception Center: After our army retreated to the second line of defense, all the villagers in the areas of Zhenru, Dachang, and Nanxiang gathered at Caojiadu. After reports from the Buddhist relief workers Sha Shouchong and Gong Zhenqu, the general office approved the establishment of the Fourth Reception Center at the Caojiadu Security Corps. The number of people who have come to seek refuge has reached nearly 3,000. On the one hand, they are contacting enthusiastic people in the area such as Zhu Rongping, Wang Dezhang, and Zhu Wenbo to handle the matter. On the other hand, they are finding ways to accommodate as many people as possible to prevent the villagers from having nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Work of the Refugee Relief Association: The Temporary Refugee Relief Association in the War Zone has been actively working recently, following the principle of both receiving and sending off refugees to maintain local order and the livelihood of the refugees. Yesterday (the 5th), the rescue team rescued refugees from various war zones, and the number of registered refugees was 620. In addition to sending 285 people to Yangzhou, 17 to the port, 15 to Wuhu, 4 to Nanjing, and 10 to Anqing, the rest were sent to various boarding houses such as Zhilanfang, the Great World, Qitian Stage, and Albert Road. In addition, the association hired the Jianghua special steamer to transport refugees along the Yangtze River, totaling more than 6,000 people. Yesterday, it received a telegram from the association's special commissioners Sun Jingzhai and Zheng Runzhi, stating that the steamer had arrived in Wuhu on the evening of the 4th and disembarked more than 2,000 refugees, requesting further funding to return to their hometowns, and also telegraphed to request instructions on how to handle this. The association had intended to provide funds from the association to send them back to their hometowns, but since there were also refugees on the special steamer who did not belong to the association, they were concerned that the funds would not be evenly distributed. Therefore, they are finding other ways to have local charitable organizations send them back to their hometowns on their behalf, without providing additional funds. The association has already telegraphed the steamer to proceed accordingly. It is also reported that the Daqing steamer of the Dada Company, which left the pier the day before yesterday, carrying more than 3,000 refugees, will also be handled in the same way.</p>
<p>Yongyi Cemetery Accommodates Refugees: The Yongyi Cemetery of the Siming Guild Hall on Xixinqiao Ningbo Road in the French Concession has now hired workers from charitable organizations to build dozens of temporary bamboo houses. After the construction is completed, electricians will be hired to install electric lights and arrange everything. It began accommodating women and children yesterday, named the "Qiyuan Buddhist Association Refugee Women and Children Shelter." Various staff members and workers are currently contacting a large number of women and children refugees to handle the accommodation affairs.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Compatriots Send Refugees Back Home: Due to the outbreak of the war by the violent Japanese, the number of refugees from Jiangxi Province living in the Zhabei and Hongkou areas exceeded 10,000. The Jiangxi Guild Hall was specially set up as a refugee reception center to raise funds for supplies. Over the past month, more than 2,100 of the most destitute refugees have been received and registered. A few days ago, Standing Committee members Shi Yuemen and Huang Baoxiang of the Guild Hall, along with compatriot Bao Chengzhi, personally went to the Shanghai Citizens Local Maintenance Association to discuss the matter and agreed to use the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangtian steamer to transport the refugees to Xun and then to the province. Yesterday (March 5th), Shi Yuemen, Huang Baoxiang, and Bao Chengzhi directed the refugees to board the steamer and contacted the shipowner Qin You Shi to arrange the refugees' positions on the ship and the supplies along the way. Everything has been prepared sufficiently, and compatriots [blank] Yongzuo and Hu Jusheng were appointed as the chief escorts along the way to [blank] manage all the affairs of the refugees along the way. The steamer set sail from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 6th [blank]. This group of refugees is the first batch sent back by the association.</p>
<p>Women's Hospital for Wounded Soldiers: In this Shanghai incident, all sectors of society organized hospitals to rescue wounded soldiers, sparing no effort. Women leaders, Mrs. Chiang and Mrs. Kong, also continued to initiate the organization of a temporary women's hospital for wounded soldiers on the fourth and fifth floors of the Mainland Department Store on Jiujiang Road, and invited Mr. Liu Ruiheng to preside over the hospital affairs. A board of directors was established to oversee the rescue of wounded soldiers on the front lines. Recently, as the war shifted to the Nanxiang area, the Japanese army intensified its attacks. The hospital, based on its principle of rescuing the front lines, plans to send doctors, nurses, and all necessary rescue equipment to the rear of our army. The other hospitals in Shanghai have already been enthusiastically organized and have responsible people in charge. They should maintain this spirit throughout. It is reported that in recent days, as the war zone has shifted, each hospital has transferred some of the lightly wounded soldiers it had originally received to this hospital, but this hospital has not accommodated them. The hospital believes that dividing the work makes it easier to handle. It is hoped that each hospital will uphold its conscience, fulfill its inherent responsibilities, and continue to work as usual, without forgetting its original intentions, so as not to let down the sacrifices of our blood-soaked compatriots. [blank] The Lawyers' Association Actively Comforts: The entire committee of the Shanghai Lawyers' Association's Comforting the Front-Line Soldiers Association, consisting of one hundred members, has been rushing around to solicit donations for days. In less than three weeks, as of yesterday, a total of more than 30,000 yuan in cash has been raised. In terms of goods, in addition to silk cotton vests, binoculars, underwear, towels, woolen items, and food, etc., which have been sent to the front lines three times, another 900 sets of military underwear and food such as black dates, anchovies, and fried rice have recently been raised. They plan to find a way to transport them immediately, and Dr. Zheng Xiuxiu raised 500 yuan of foreign [currency] yesterday to comfort the front-line soldiers.</p>
<p>Baolong Hospital Receives Donations: Since the outbreak of the war, Baolong Hospital in this city has been extremely enthusiastic about rescue matters. Initially, doctors and nurses from the hospital organized a rescue team to set out and engage in rescue work, and they made every effort to vacate space in the hospital to accommodate 150 wounded soldiers and several injured refugees, all of whom were given new-style treatment and surgery. The hospital, aware that there are many wounded soldiers, has stipulated that it will focus on accommodating seriously wounded soldiers in order to maximize practical benefits. However, it is reported that the hospital's funds are limited, so it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide financial and material assistance so that it can proceed smoothly. It is learned that the hospital has recently received donations as follows: Mr. &amp; Mrs. A.W. Burkill, one hundred [and] ten taels of silver,</p>
<p>Mrs. A. de Gherardy, one hundred and fifty taels of silver, Mr. E. Hayim, one hundred yuan of foreign [currency], Mr. F. Hoehnke, fifty yuan of foreign [currency], Mr. R. Lorenz, ten yuan of foreign [currency], Mr. J. Dupuy, fifty yuan of foreign [currency], Miss Shekury, thirty yuan of foreign [currency], Gong Ziyu, two hundred yuan of foreign [currency] from HSBC, Yong'an Company, two hundred yuan of foreign [currency], Qianxin Foreign Company, various medicines, valued at approximately two hundred yuan of foreign [currency].</p>
<p>Tenants' Association Accommodates Refugees: The Shanghai City [blank] Tenants' General Federation, aware that in the past few days, the number of compatriots who have been victimized in Zhabei, Zhenru, Jiangwan, Dachang, etc., has been increasing daily, wandering on the streets, which is too terrible to bear, specially convened a meeting yesterday to find ways to provide relief. The attending committee members Zhu Wenbo, Wu Songquan, Qin Linsheng, etc., a total of seven people, resolved to provide accommodation, and Shen Shuren, the principal of Fucheng Elementary School in Xinkangli, Caojiadu, enthusiastically supported them, opening up all the school buildings. The accommodation started on the 2nd of this month, and the number of people has reached more than 400. It is also reported that the second accommodation center has also started operations.</p>
<p>Work of the Refugee Relief Association: After our army voluntarily withdrew its defenses and changed the area, the number of refugees increased even more. In addition to continuing to send rescue trucks to the war zone to rescue refugees and take them to safety, the association, aware that the various accommodation centers are mostly full, is finding ways to find houses to accommodate as many people as possible. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously agree to lend their houses to the association as shelters for the rescued refugees. In addition, the association registered a total of 759 refugees in the past two days (the 3rd and 4th). In addition to sending those to other cities, including 70 to Hangzhou, 153 to Wuxi, 7 to Suzhou, 41 to Wuhu, and 12 to Anqing, the rest were sent to accommodation centers such as Fozang Temple, Leimi Fang, Chengdu Road, and Shenyuli. Another 101 people were sent to other cities from various accommodation centers.</p>
<p>Please All Compatriot Associations Help Refugees: The Shanghai War Zone Temporary Refugee Relief Association's affiliated joint office of the Shanghai-based compatriot associations sent letters to all compatriot associations in this city yesterday, stating, "Respectfully informing you that due to the violence of the Japanese bandits, with the flames of war raging, the compatriots in the war zone have suffered terrible disasters, wandering in pain, which is heartbreaking to see. Therefore, people from various charitable and public welfare organizations in this city have initiated the organization of the Shanghai War Zone Temporary Refugee Relief Association, sending people to the war zone to rescue the affected compatriots from danger, providing accommodation as much as possible, and sending them back to their hometowns. The number of people who have been rescued has reached more than 10,000, and the number of boarding houses of the association has increased to more than 20. The compatriot associations have also established their own accommodation centers to accommodate the affected compatriots and have prepared ships to continue to send them back to their hometowns. However, the number of people remaining in Shanghai is still very large. If we do not quickly plan to send them off, we are deeply concerned that it will be difficult to maintain the supplies and other things. Therefore, on March 1st, this office convened the second joint meeting of representatives of various compatriot associations and resolved that, in addition to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghua steamer, which has been prepared by the Shanghai War Zone Temporary Refugee Relief Association to send a batch of refugees from the various boarding houses first, we will also discuss with the shipping bureau to prepare more ships to facilitate large-scale sending off. However, the supplies for sending off refugees all require funds. We have always known that your association has a charitable heart and will certainly support this initiative and generously donate. This matter concerns relief, so we are sending this letter to you, and we ask you to do your utmost to solicit donations and provide a prompt response so that we can provide sufficient assistance and send off as many people as possible. We are extremely grateful. City Temporary Relief Association."</p>

It is bordered by Longhua to the east, Zhongshan Road and Xujiahui to the south, Beixinjing to the west, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to the north. After our army retreated this time, Japanese soldiers asked to go to Beixinjing. However, Liu Lun, the director of the sixth district and third precinct of the town's Public Security Bureau, and Yang Xinzheng, the head of the security corps, have been stepping up precautions. In addition to the original police and corps, patrolmen from the fourth and fifth districts of Zhabei are also working together. At the entrances and exits, double-manned stations are set up, and all pedestrians are subject to inspection. The defense is very strict.</p>

<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Pawnshop and Pledge Industry Association yesterday, stating, "To the point, we have recently received a letter from refugees from Jiangbei stating that the people have received free tickets to return to their hometowns from the great philanthropists, but temporarily, the clothes on their bodies are all pledged in pawnshops and pledge shops, and they have no money to redeem them. The interest on the interest is heavy, and the pawnshops and pledge shops are not open yet, adding to their suffering. Please forward [this] to the Pawnshop and Pledge Association to extend the deadline for a few months, etc. We have found that the pawnshops and pledges are not open now, so the goods that have expired cannot be extended with interest. The fault does not lie with the pledgers and mortgagors. If [we] immediately and completely terminate [the agreement], it seems unfair in view of the situation. It is appropriate to send a letter to your association to discuss with the industry to extend the deadline for a few months for the sake of the pledgers and mortgagors, and then completely terminate [the agreement]. This is an extraordinary event, which cannot be judged by ordinary rules. We believe that the industry of your association can share this meaning."</p>

<p>Urging the Silver Industry to Organize a Syndicate</p>
<p>The Food Price Equalization Maintenance Association of this city convened a meeting at the municipal government yesterday. Representatives from the silver industry and the city chamber of commerce attended. It was agreed that all the foreign rice that has arrived in port has not yet been shipped out, which will greatly affect future orders and the food supply of the city. The silver industry should be requested to organize a syndicate to accept mortgage loans at 80% of the market price to facilitate turnover. The silver industry representatives were responsible for handling this matter. On the one hand, the association will conduct a thorough investigation of the quantity of rice that has arrived in port and is in storage. It has now been verified that the total amount of rice in storage in the city is worth approximately 3 million taels of silver. At 80%, the mortgage loan needed is 2.4 million taels of silver. It is learned that the association has urged the silver industry associations to quickly form a syndicate and then invite responsible representatives from the city chamber of commerce, the banking industry, the money industry, and the rice industry to discuss the implementation plan.</p>

<p>The Special Session of the League of Nations Had Heated Discussions the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Many Representatives Advocated Economic Sanctions</p>
<p>A General Resolution Will Be Made After the Discussion</p>
<p>(Geneva) During the League of Nations Assembly meeting today, the discussions were quite heated. British Representative Simon spoke once to request an end to the hostilities in the meeting. The disturbance in the meeting was mostly caused by the long-term verbal battle between the Chinese and Japanese representatives. After the debate stopped and the discussion resumed, the atmosphere became more peaceful. The afternoon meeting started at 4:45. At that time, eight people had already signed up to speak, mostly representatives of small countries. Their words were very direct and criticized Japan severely. Among them, three expressed their intention to use economic sanctions. However, the discussion was not finished, and the assembly adjourned again and will resume on March 7th, so the motion was not proposed again.</p>
<h3 id="e46">No Hesitation Should Be Had if Mediation is Ineffective <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The first speaker in the afternoon was Danish Representative Munch, who said that in the past few days, people have been asking why the League of Nations allows bloodshed events like those seen in China to happen. He knew that special circumstances require patient responses, and it is commendable that the Executive Council is trying to resolve the dispute through talks according to the provisions of the Charter. The League of Nations Assembly is also seeking a compromise by adopting reconciliation methods. However, if mediation is ineffective, he believes that there should be no hesitation in immediately using the necessary plans to sanction the aggressive country that continues to engage in hostilities in defiance of the League of Nations' ceasefire order.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Small Countries Should Show Their Unity <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Swiss Representative Motta took the meaning of the various articles of the League of Nations Charter for detailed analysis and said that the outbreak of hostilities has exceeded the accidental accidents stated in Article 15 of the Charter. However, this article of the Charter first contains reconciliation procedures. He believes that under this procedure, there is still a good reason to hope for success. Using this procedure can make the enemy's use of the second paragraph of this article unnecessary. He hopes that the countries participating in the meeting will abide by the attitude of impartiality before the reconciliation procedures are exhausted, arrange solutions on the one hand, and prepare the procedures to be adopted when the solution is not successful on the other hand. He proposed organizing a group of members to study all the causes of the dispute and report to the assembly. After Motta elaborated on the extremely serious consequences that treaty-breaking countries must suffer under the second paragraph of Article 15 of the Charter, he said that if small countries lose trust in the organs of peaceful procedures, they will be forced to use other methods to protect their security. Therefore, small countries should show their unity in the current crisis.</p>

<p>Motta's remarks were met with applause. Estonian Representative Tõnisson agreed with the meaning expressed by the above speakers and said that it is regrettable that any country would use force to resolve disputes with neighboring countries. The big problem facing the League of Nations today is whether to listen to such a big problem in history.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Hoping to Apply the Power of the Charter <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Spanish Representative Zulueta spoke, expressing the hope that the League of Nations will apply all the power of the Charter to resolve the current dispute to meet the expectations of the world, and said that there are currently three ways: 1) The Assembly's responsibility lies in declaring that the Charter requires the withdrawal of troops before negotiations; 2) The Assembly must not let people forget that Article 10 of the Charter is the highest charter of the League of Nations; 3) The League of Nations Charter should be particularly effective to deal with countries whose organization is not sufficient. Czech Representative Bienes said that he did not want to favor in this dispute. The Czech Republic has not forgotten the friendly assistance given by China and Japan in the Great War. He meant that the two countries must know that what the League of Nations Assembly is doing now is what the Assembly should do for any other country's case. The League of Nations must fully fulfill its duties. What is being considered now is indeed a special situation, but in any case, the League of Nations Charter must be respected. He deeply regrets that Japan did not first submit this dispute to the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Persian Representative Bahabolafa spoke, saying that the country he represents is an Asian country that is friendly to both China and Japan. He sincerely hopes for a quick solution that will not endanger world peace. The organization of the League of Nations is regarded by the entire East as a new era in international cooperation. The inactivity of the League of Nations now has caused great disappointment. The League of Nations' remarks can be compared to a powerless cry in the wilderness. He hopes that the Assembly will use its full power to restore its masculinity in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>Greek Representative Politis rose and said that if the respect for the League of Nations Charter is not confirmed, the world will return to barbarism. If the League of Nations had police, the situation would not be as bad as it is now. China submitted its case to the League of Nations, and he congratulated China. He suggested that the League of Nations Assembly should form a committee to follow up on the negotiations between the two sides in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The South American Uruguay representative said that he represents the Latin American nations of South America and that we must give the world firm and powerful evidence so that the League of Nations knows that it is upholding the principles of the Charter.</p>
<p>The last speaker was the Portuguese representative, who said that he hopes that China and Japan will respect the treaties and obtain a happy solution. (5th Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Disarmament Work May Be Suspended <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Assembly will be extended to at least the middle of next week, which can be expected at present. The work of the Disarmament Conference may be postponed accordingly. According to the opinions of important representatives who attended both the Special Assembly and the Disarmament Conference at the same time, the Sino-Japanese conflict and the disarmament issue cannot be discussed together. Now is the time when the Special Assembly is busy, and the agenda still has a very long list of representatives waiting to speak after the speeches of those who will speak on Monday afternoon are completed. The Assembly will definitely establish a committee to draft a final resolution based on the interpretations obtained during the discussions. If the various delegations request that the Manchuria issue and the Shanghai issue be mentioned in the same breath, then this resolution will definitely be difficult to write. Even if this difficulty can be overcome, other difficulties will follow. For example, Greek Representative Politis proposed organizing a committee to continue the work of the Assembly until the session in September. The effectiveness of this committee is still questionable. Most delegations believe that the Sino-Japanese issue should be handled exclusively by the Executive Council. Looking at the above-mentioned difficulties, it can be seen that the discussion has not yet yielded results. At present, the various delegations are seeking ways to deal with this complex issue and important responsibility. (5th Havas telegram)</p>

<p>The London Observer's editorial today said that Japan's too easy deductive code of political morality has been excessively resisted. If it plans to extend its military power, it will only harm itself. What the League of Nations can do is nothing more than seeking the cessation of hostilities. The League of Nations restrains itself for the sake of maintaining peace in the Far East and does not want to expand its actions until its service power is ineffective. The tragedy now lies in this. Now that Japan has expressed that it does not want to participate in the actions of delaying the facts, the League of Nations should strive for practicality and build peace on the basis of earnestly sorting out moral rights to maintain the trust of people in the future.

<p>To Ascertain the Truth of the Shanghai War</p>
<p>(Washington) The US State Department today authorized Major General Tayner, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, through the Navy Department, to determine whether the hostile actions of the Chinese and Japanese troops near Shanghai have actually stopped, together with the naval commanders of Britain, France, and Italy. Although the United States has only authorized Major General Tayner at this time to determine the actual state of the current Sino-Japanese war together with the commanders of other countries, it is heard that the State Department is inclined to support the League of Nations ceasefire plan, which advocates that Chinese troops remain in their current locations and Japanese troops completely withdraw to the Public Concession. The State Department authorities have stated that they do not believe that any plan can be implemented without a provision requiring Japan to make some concessions, because China has already indicated that it does not want to reject the basis of Japan's original conditions.

<h3 id="e59">Military Progress of the War of Resistance Against Japan <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Report in the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Excerpts from the military report passed by the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee are as follows:</p>
<p>The second plenary meeting of the fourth central executive committee of our party is convened in the acting capital. We look back on the past. From the closing of the first plenary meeting to the present, it has only been two months. In this shortest period, foreign aggression and domestic trouble have tormented each other. What we have been striving for day and night is the two things: resistance against Japan and suppression of the Red bandits. Regarding the military affairs of suppressing the bandits, due to the recent impact of the military affairs against Japan, the entire planned encirclement plan has not yet been implemented step by step. Now, I would like to report the situation of the military progress of the legitimate defense against Japan to the rear. Before the January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out, our Shanghai garrison originally had only one infantry brigade. Since the Japanese Marines began to attack us with artillery fire and aircraft, we had to order the infantry in front to do their best to resist, and at the same time mobilize the 19th Route Army stationed along the Beijing-Shanghai line in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan, and Nanxiang to assist as the situation developed. We also ordered the □□ regiment to be under the command of the 19th Route to cooperate. On February 4th, the Military Affairs Commission divided the country into □ defense zones. (omitted) At the end of January, our Shanghai garrison repeatedly repelled the Japanese Marines, and the Japanese side increased its land forces to aid. At that time, our army also ordered the main force of the □□□ division to gather from □□ to □□, and ordered the □□ division to gather in the Suzhou-Kunshan area before the 5th, and the □□ unit to go to the □□ and □□ towns area and be under the command of the 19th Route. Afterwards, they all successively went to the front to reinforce. We also ordered the various combat and fighter aircraft squadrons stationed in □□□□□□ to suppress the bandits to quickly gather in □□ to stand by. At the beginning of February, we also transferred □□□□□ and □□□□ from □□, and transferred part of the □□th and □□th entire □□□, and the □□ brigade from □□ to aid in different ways. At that time, Nomura was repeatedly defeated by the Japanese side, and another order was issued to the commander of the 9th Division, Ueda, to command the Marines, about 12,000 people, the 12th Division, about 11,000 people, and the 9th Division, about 14,000 people, as well as dozens of warships and hundreds of aircraft, to launch fierce attacks on our Zhabei, Jiangwan, Miaohang, Wusong positions, and various fortress areas, but they never succeeded. At the same time, our aviation team also tried its best to resist the aircraft showing off everywhere, and at the same time telegraphed and transferred a team of □ aircraft squadrons, transferred from □□□□ to □zhou to assist in the battle as the situation developed. On February 15th, for the convenience of command, □□□ was the commander of the 5th Army, commanding the 87th and 88th divisions, and led the □□ corps directly under □□□□, the mountain artillery team of □□□□, and the □□ squad, etc., to rush to the front to reinforce the 19th Route Army. On February 18th, the British Minister met with the chiefs of staff of the highest command of the Chinese and Japanese troops in Shanghai to discuss peace methods, but the Japanese army not only had no sincerity, but its commander Ueda also issued an ultimatum to our 19th Route Army Commander Cai. (omitted) Our country will never recognize such unreasonable demands. Therefore, since mid-February, the Wusong, Jiangwan, Miaohang town area has entered a state of fierce fighting. Relying on the loyalty and bravery of our soldiers to resist, we have repeatedly dealt painful blows to the brutal Japanese army, preventing it from crossing the Lei pool by one step. It is estimated that within a month of the Japanese army starting the war in Shanghai, their warships and aircraft were destroyed, and many □ Ke tanks and guns were captured. It is reported that the Japanese army suffered casualties of over 10,000 people. The Japanese did not know how to repent of their sins, and after repeated defeats, they telegraphed their country to send additional reinforcements. It is reported that their 11th Division and 14th Division have been successively transported to Shanghai, and many army aircraft have been sent to bomb the Suzhou-Shanghai section of our Beijing-Shanghai Road and the Shanghai-Jiading section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road in an attempt to destroy our transportation and cut off our supply. Their newly arrived land forces, also under the cover of the navy and air force, landed at Yanglinkou and Qiyakou near Liuhhe. In order to prevent the Japanese army from copying the flanks, our army automatically and safely withdrew to the line of Nanxiang and Jiading on the evening of the first of this month. In short, all our soldiers are determined to resist persistently and never stop. No matter how violent and unreasonable the Japanese are, our army will never be willing to surrender. The final victory of justice and righteousness will still belong to us. However, it also depends on the unanimous uprising of the people across the country to be the backbone of the party and the country. (omitted) (5th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) A delegation of representatives from German women's groups went to the Japanese Embassy here today to protest Japan's torture of defenseless civilians in Shanghai, saying that thousands of women and children died in the Japanese army's war equipment.

<h3 id="e61">The Future of Disarmament is Bleak <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Thoughts of the German Political Circles</p>
<p>(Berlin) French Prime Minister Tardieu gave a speech in the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly advocating that France's military equipment cannot be reduced again until there is a secure peace organization. He also said that France cannot agree to Germany's expansion of military equipment and the abolition of the regulations that no military equipment is placed on both sides of the Rhine River. The German political circles felt that the future of disarmament was extremely bleak when they heard this speech. Although they knew that Tardieu's remarks were inevitably affected by the general election, they believed that no matter which party was in power after the election, the aforementioned few words were the basic policy of France and could not be changed. Therefore, the Geneva Disarmament Conference has actually been in vain, and Germany, in any case, cannot give up its claim to equal treatment with the great powers. Furthermore, this kind of argument is enough to strike a blow to the optimists in the Disarmament Conference who hope that France can take a more reasonable and compromise attitude. The domestic policy of the Germans, who have been newly disappointed, may also be unfortunately affected, because in the future elections in Germany, the national rights faction will be more likely to gain power.

<p>Far East Situation</p>
<h3 id="e62">Impact on Britain <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Britain Will Be Forced to Expand its Navy</p>
<p>London British Review's editorial writer Stead published an article in the Sunday Times today, discussing the reaction of the Far East situation on the interests of the British Empire, saying that the United States has recently given an indication that if Japan continues to violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, the United States will definitely build defense projects in the Philippines and Guam. If this kind of development exists, then the US Navy will definitely increase greatly, and Britain will also be forced to expand its navy in the same way, unless Britain is willing to give up the principle of British and American naval equality. If this principle is abandoned, then Australia, New Zealand, and western Canada will have to rely on the protection of the US Navy when a war breaks out between the United States and Japan. Herriot, the former French Prime Minister and now the leader of the Radical Party, revealed in an article in the Sunday Tribunal that, in practical terms, Japan is now taking advantage of the difficulties in Europe to establish its position as much as possible in Chinese territory. If Japan achieves its goal, then it is useless to deny the existence of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Non-War Pact, the League of Nations Charter, and the League of Nations itself.

<p>Reply Concerning the Revision of Commercial Treaties</p>
<p>Vienna, Austrian Chancellor Buresch recently requested neighboring countries to revise new commercial treaties to help Austria overcome its economic difficulties. Germany's reply was conveyed to the Austrian government the night before by the German ambassador, stating that although Germany is facing its own difficulties in both public and private sectors, it will do its best to help Austria if it can. Yesterday, Austrian newspapers attached great importance to this, considering it an initial success of Buresch's appeal, enough to open the door to new German-Austrian economic cooperation negotiations, and also an indirect response to France's efforts to organize a Danube River basin alliance. It is said that although the French plan is sufficient to consolidate its hegemony in Southeastern Europe, Britain and Italy have expressed their approval. However, Austrian newspapers are deeply concerned about Germany's exclusion, fearing that it will become a major obstacle to the future union between the two Germanic nations. Now, with the German reply, the momentum of those in Austria who oppose the French plan can be increased. As the "Reichspost" newspaper titled, "The Germans Come to Rescue Our Austria," the content welcomes the German reply, which indicates a willingness to conclude a preferential tariff agreement with Austria, stating that from now on, the Austrian government should be able to oppose the French proposal to organize a Danube River alliance. "For the sake of Austrian dignity and economic self-preservation, they cannot join any alliance of Germany," it is said. (National Press Agency telegram of the 5th)</p>

Kashi will complete the handover and go to Tanggu on the morning of the 5th with more than fifty women and children, claiming to return to his country. According to Western sources, Kashi's move is completely deceiving the Chinese, because he sent out invitations on the 5th to host a banquet for the commanders of the British, American, and French armies and consuls on the evening of the 7th. At that time, he will definitely hold Chinese newspapers that recorded his return to his country and discredit the Chinese newspapers for spreading rumors, and cite that the Shanghai and Liaoning incidents reported were all untrustworthy.

The leaders of the Southwest have always loved the party and the country. In the face of this powerful enemy, they should carry out national salvation work. If they take the opportunity to exploit the situation and cause division again, they cannot escape the blame for betraying the country. 3. There must be financial resources to back up military strength, so that it can continue for a long time.

<p>Yu Mome and Li Yangjing Preside Separately</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong Province is actively proceeding with the plan to send troops to Jiangxi and Fujian for joint defense and bandit suppression. The troops entering Jiangxi include all of Yu Hanmou's and Fan Dexing's troops. Fan's troops are currently concentrated in Dayu, waiting to depart with full equipment. The rear is rushing to make cotton clothes to transport to them to facilitate military operations. Ye Zhao's division of Yu's troops has also assembled in Nanxiong. Li Zhenqiu's division has been taking the route of Shaozhou to advance towards Nanxiong in recent days. Chen Kefu, the artillery commander of Yu's troops, was also ordered yesterday to lead his troops from the province to Shaozhou to await orders. It is expected that they will advance to southern Jiangxi within days. After Yu's troops leave, the defense of northern Jiangxi will be taken over by Chen Zhangfu's troops, who are moving from Sanshui in western Jiangxi, and will also serve as Yu's backup team. Regarding the transportation in northern Jiangxi, a transportation headquarters has been established in Shaozhou, with branch stations in Nanxiong and Shixing. The Air Force Headquarters has also dispatched several aircraft to Shaozhou to await orders. As for the troops entering Fujian, they will be commanded by Li Yangjing, and Huang Renhuan's troops will also depart with him. Huang's troops have recently incorporated Yan Yingyu's brigade to strengthen their forces. Huang Renhuan came to the province yesterday to pay his respects to the military authorities and ask for instructions and receive pay. It is heard that after Huang's troops depart, Huizhou and its subordinate areas will be taken over by Zhang Da's troops. Zhang Meixin's troops, originally stationed in Zengcheng and Longmen, were also ordered to be stationed in Heping and Lianping at the same time to coordinate with the troops entering Jiangxi and Fujian. The authorities believe that with the large number of troops entering Jiangxi and Fujian being mobilized in the coming days, military pay should be raised to facilitate military operations. Yesterday, they specifically ordered Feng Zhuwan, the Director of Finance, to quickly raise 800,000 yuan to be used as the departure expenses for each unit. As for the labor force, various counties in western Jiangxi are responsible for recruiting and handing them over to each unit for use. The provincial government also decided to order the Shantou branch of the Gold Treasury to allocate 50,000 yuan first to rush to build an airfield in Chaoan County, so that the air force can coordinate with the army in entering Fujian. The Air Force Headquarters will also temporarily dispatch a squadron of aircraft to Shantou to await orders. (February 27)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Incitement of Xi Qia for Ding and Li <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Dispatching Sun Qichang to Persuade</p>
<p>Ding and Li Request Three Conditions</p>
<p>Eastern Railway Refuses Japanese Demand to Transport Troops by Train</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Xi Qia is extremely alarmed after the Jilin Self-Defense Army occupied various towns along the Harbin-Suifenhe line of the Eastern Railway. In addition to pleading with Japanese General Tamon to dispatch a large force of Japanese soldiers as reinforcements, he also hopes to persuade Ding Chao and Li Du to surrender peacefully. On February 26th, he first telegraphed Gao Qidong, the former director of the Binjiang Public Security Bureau, to go to Yimianpo to visit Ding and Li, and earnestly requested them to send representatives to Harbin for negotiations. Gao arrived in Harbin early on the 27th. At the same time, Xi Qia's representative, Sun Qichang, the director of the Jilin Finance Department, also arrived in Harbin. Sun, together with Gao, and Yuan Qinglian, the director of the Binjiang Tax Bureau, who is very friendly with Ding Chao, traveled in a special train provided by the Eastern Railway, departing that afternoon for Yimianpo and arriving in the evening. The two sides immediately held talks in the special train. Sun Qichang personally handed Xi Qia's handwritten letter to Ding and Li. The letter stated that the new state of the Northeast has been established, and China is hopeless. You and I are old comrades-in-arms, why must we fight each other so urgently? If there is anything to discuss, Sun Qichang will personally discuss it. This is the last chance, and I hope you will not miss it, etc. Ding and Li immediately stated that if a peaceful understanding is to be reached, (1) two months' military pay must be issued first, (2) everyone should be reinstated to their original positions and original defense areas, and those who do not have defense areas should be designated immediately, and (3) You Shencheng should be dismissed to appease the public anger. Sun Qichang only agreed to the first item immediately, while the second and third items were more important and required instructions from Xi Qia. At noon on the 28th, Sun and his party returned to Harbin and reported the negotiations to Xi Qia. In the evening, Xi Qia telegraphed back, believing that it could be discussed, but Ding and Li must withdraw their troops thirty li outside the railway line to avoid conflict in order to show their sincerity in accepting mediation. Sun immediately telegraphed Ding and Li. The Self-Defense Army then, on the night of the 28th, except for a small number of troops stationed at Mao'ershan, Wujili, and Yimianpo stations, withdrew the main force to the vicinity of Yanshou County, awaiting Xi Qia's terms of acceptance. Currently, Sun Qichang has been ordered by Xi Qia to rush to raise military pay for Ding and Li in Harbin, preparing to send personnel to distribute it. However, yesterday, after the main force of the Self-Defense Army withdrew from the railway line, the bandit troops of Yu Shencheng immediately advanced from Acheng, with their vanguard stopping at Ercedianzi. It is generally rumored that Xi Qia and Ding and Li have no sincerity in making peace. Ding and Li aim to swindle military pay, while Xi Qia wants to take advantage of the Self-Defense Army's withdrawal to seize various key points, and then advance from Fangzheng and Bin County to encircle them. Yesterday, Yu Shencheng led a part of his bandit troops from Shuangcheng to Bin County, presumably to realize this plan.</p>
<p>On the day the vanguard of the Self-Defense Army reached the outskirts of Harbin, there was extreme panic here. On the 24th, the Zhao Yi brigade of the Self-Defense Army from Huangshan Zuizi, east of Harbin, had a fierce battle with the Japanese army stationed in Harbin and the Second Garrison Brigade of Xi Qia. The fighting started at 3 a.m. and stopped at noon. Due to strategic considerations, the Self-Defense Army did not dare to attack fiercely and withdrew to Bin County. On the morning of the 25th, there were also fierce battles between Xiaolingzi Station and Erdaohezi on the Harbin-Suifenhe line. The Feng Zhanhai brigade of the Self-Defense Army surrounded the Liu Baolin department of the Second Garrison Brigade of the pseudo-Jilin, launching a fierce attack. The fighting stopped at 2 p.m. Liu's brigade was defeated and retreated to Acheng. On the same day, Yu Shencheng led thousands of bandit troops from Shuangcheng to reinforce and set up defenses with the Japanese soldiers. The Murakami detachment of the Japanese army stationed in Liaoning also arrived in Harbin on the 26th and demanded that the Eastern Railway allocate trains to transport troops to the eastern line. The Russian director refused, saying that since Japanese soldiers from Changchun to Harbin claimed to be protecting Japanese residents, the Eastern Railway endured the significant loss of business for a time and allowed the Japanese to run their own trains. Now that there are no Japanese residents in the east, the Japanese should not transport troops there again, causing significant losses to railway transportation. On the 27th, the Japanese Consul-General in Harbin, Ohashi, visited the Russian director again and insisted on allocating trains, but the Russian side still refused and issued a notice to the Self-Defense Army and the Japanese Army Headquarters, stating that the Harbin-Suifenhe line of the Eastern Railway should not be used for military activities. On the same evening, the Japanese army transferred 100 Manchurian Railway workers from Changchun to Harbin, intending to forcibly drive Eastern Railway vehicles eastward with soldiers boarding the trains on the evening of the 27th, but the Eastern Railway refused to allocate trains, and they were unable to depart. Today, as the situation has eased, the Japanese army has stopped heading east. (February 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo Banking Circles Conference</p>
<h3 id="e98">Countermeasures Against Economic Blockade <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Coping with US Boycott and Debt Collection</p>
<p>And Changes Arising After Public Bond Raising</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports that when the League of Nations Investigation Committee led by Lord Lytton and others passed through Tokyo, the industrial and business community (referring to Japan) specifically convened a meeting at the Japan Economic League Association Industrial Club with key figures from the military to discuss their opinions on the Chinese situation in order to inquire about the Investigation Committee's opinions on the Chinese situation. The meeting invited Army Minister Araki, Vice Minister Sugiyama, Military Affairs Bureau Chief Koiso, Councilor Toki, and others. Attendees included more than 30 industrialists such as Go, Kimura, Kodama, Ikeda, Kushida, Yasukawa, Nakajima, Isomura, Iguchi, Oka, and Yuki. Key figures from the military reported on the actual situation in Manchuria and Mongolia and the Shanghai war situation. After the meeting, representatives from Tokyo banking circles were summoned, including Ikeda from Mitsui Bank, Kushida from Mitsubishi Bank, Mori from Yasuda Bank, Akashi from Dai-ichi Bank, Hoshino from Kawasaki Hyaku Bank, Yuki from Industrial Bank, Kodama from Yokohama Specie Bank, and Matsuda from Bank of Chosen, to discuss how the banking world should respond in the event of an economic blockade by the League of Nations. First, Ikeda reported, "Army Minister Araki said that our country (Japan) is currently in a difficult situation more serious than the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars. How will our peace-loving bankers handle it to ensure a good outcome?" Then, the attendees expressed their opinions based on information obtained from inside and outside the country and discussed them with each other. The consensus was as follows: (1) The most important thing at present is the US's proposal for an economic break with Japan, as the US has already shown its anti-Japanese behavior towards Japanese banks, trading companies, shipping companies, etc., and is urging Japan to repay its old debts, which should be dealt with as soon as possible. (2) Our country's (Japan) finances have long been in dire straits, and have become even more desperate due to this incident. In the end, wartime public bonds will have to be raised from the general public, causing the value of these public bonds to decline daily and abnormal changes to occur in the financial world. Our bankers should take a very cautious attitude, prioritizing the nation and sharing national difficulties. After exchanging opinions, everyone strongly advocated peace and avoiding an economic blockade. However, in the event of its realization, Japanese bankers should be prepared with great determination and take further measures as the situation develops, holding second and third meetings as necessary.</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports that since the outbreak of the movement in various states of the US for economic blockade against Japan based on petitions from the public, financial trade and other aspects in the country have gradually become a reality. The most fierce resistance to Japanese goods is in the eastern regions such as Washington and New York, and there is a trend of moving towards the west. In terms of finance, the supply of funds to Japan is refused, and all Japanese public bonds are not accepted. Therefore, foreign exchange banks, trust insurance companies, etc. on the Japanese side are greatly affected. In terms of shipping, the boycott of Japanese goods has turned into a rejection of Japanese traders and Japanese shipping companies. They thoroughly implement the principle of "national goods, national ships," and Americans have terminated their previous contracts with Japan due to the convocation of the International General Assembly. Therefore, the situation of American boycott of Japanese goods is like a prairie fire, which has greatly affected our country's (Japan) trade sector. The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun recently published a long economic essay entitled "What Impact Will We Suffer If an Economic Blockade Against Japan Is Realized?" Its arguments are all based on facts and are summarized below for our countrymen to study. The article states that starting with the Manchurian Incident and leading to the Shanghai War, the attitude of various countries towards Japan has become increasingly unfavorable. The US public's petition for an economic blockade against Japan is particularly precarious. At the same time, the trend of American public opinion is also gradually changing its old tune. We (Japanese) speculate that the League of Nations will use strong methods based on the Covenant to sanction the belligerent country. Therefore, we are particularly anxious about what attitude the League of Nations General Assembly will adopt when it convenes. However, although the major capitalist countries are currently trapped in an unprecedented panic-stricken predicament, if they are incited by world public opinion and implement a blockade, the economic circles of countries with relations with us (Japan) and individual relations will inevitably be completely severed. At that time, Japan will suffer greatly. However, considering the fierce confrontation between the UK and the US, the US and France, and other major countries, the vested interests of each country in Japan, except for the international relations with Soviet Russia, Japan will certainly not be completely economically blockaded and fall into isolated danger. This is a powerful observation in our country's (Japan) financial circles. However, as a result of the economic blockade, the necessities of life will become more expensive. Military supplies, industries, and certain substitute industries will not be greatly affected, but industries such as the spinning industry and sericulture in overseas markets will inevitably lead to increased unemployment for workers and farmers. As a result, political and social turmoil will inevitably arise in the country, leading to ominous and unfavorable events. Therefore, we have the following two major dangers in the abstract observation after the implementation of the economic blockade: (1) The impact of the economic blockade on Japan's economic circles; (2) What is the state of Japan's supply and demand for national defense after the implementation of the economic blockade?</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the impact on the economic sector, regardless of exports or imports, they will be completely blocked due to the economic blockade. Last year, Japan's foreign trade exports were 1,179,211,334 yuan, and imports were 1,319,408,527 yuan, with imports exceeding 140,197,193 yuan. If economically blockaded, except for a small portion that can be imported and exported to Russia, Manchuria and Mongolia, and other colonies, all other countries will be fundamentally destroyed. Last year, trade with Manchuria and Mongolia was 11,874,000 yuan for exports and 41,848,000 yuan for imports. Exports to Russian Asia were 14,941,478 yuan and imports were 30,864,503 yuan. With Soviet Russia itself, exports were 2,134,635 yuan and imports were 3,787,039 yuan. The trade with each country is shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Country        Exports       Imports</p>
<p>USA         518,305,466     633,352,222*</p>

<p>China (excluding Manchuria and Mongolia)   155,750,668     145,697,197</p>
<p>From this point of view, due to the economic blockade, the relationship with all countries will be completely severed. The main export products in our country's (Japan) trade are raw silk, cotton fabrics, silk fabrics, rayon, hats, coal, iron products, machinery, and toys, which are mainly sold to the United States and the countries participating in the League of Nations. On the import side, necessities of life such as cotton, wool, hair, wool fabrics, wheat, sugar, and other raw materials for papermaking and automobile materials are mainly imported, and natural exchanges are cut off. At this time, the financial world will be directly affected. Due to the severance of the exchange market, there will be no international lending. Although Japan can avoid paying foreign debts, Japan's overseas investments and the funds of Japanese overseas will be suspended. As a result, domestic finance will inevitably lead to a large inflation of currency, and prices and wages will rise sharply. On the one hand, due to the increase in national expenses and the supply of financial resources, the financial world will show abnormal and drastic changes. Moreover, due to the inability to export, factories will have to close down. Factory closures will lead to continuous unemployment. In addition, the supply and demand relationship of goods will lose its balance, and prices will inevitably soar. As a result, all kinds of unrest will suddenly appear in society.</p>
<p>Regarding the supply and demand of national defense resources, our country (Japan) has always lacked kerosene, and all of it is imported from overseas. Such as heavy oil, volatile oil, and crude oil, about 13.3 million stones are imported every year. If there is an economic blockade, not only will the military department be stopped from this point on, but even ordinary civilian use will be impossible to obtain. The second is coal, if the relationship with Manchuria and Mongolia can be maintained, there is no need to worry. The most worrying things are nickel, lead, and wool, which will suffer a fatal blow due to the economic blockade. The military-used nickel is not produced in the mainland, and the 90 million catties of lead used for submarines and other purposes are also mostly imported from foreign countries. Wool is imported from Australia and the United States every year. Among the food, rice and grains are imported from Korea and Taiwan, but it is still not enough. Other things like wheat and cotton for flour milling are imported from the United States, Canada, and India, successively falling into desperation. What kind of feelings will the people of the whole country have due to the lack of raw materials and livelihoods and the severance of the sales of finished products? Therefore, is it possible to maintain it forcibly at this time?</p>
