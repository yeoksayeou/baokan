<h3 id="c1">國聯調查之結果如何元· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>舉世矚目之國聯調查報告書。已在平簽定矣。調查員李頓爵士等已於歡笑之迎送中由平抵滬矣。國人殷切盼望於迎送團員時欲略得調查結果之一二迹兆。而李頓爵士輒聳肩微笑。絕不稍露邊際。在爵士於事前固不能有若何表示。而在關心時局者。則已若不勝其失望矣。蓋此次調查之結果。關係不僅在中日。而實在世界全局之安危。故世人對之。無不表示深切之注意。而日人則尤於事前多方刺探。研究其結果。利中國抑利日之成分孰多。報紙時常發表其揣測論調。謂不利日。則我將奈何奈何。英美各大國不助日。則我又將奈何奈何。而其軍人派之表示。更暴露其恐嚇意味。屢屢表示其强硬主張。一謂國際輿論非難不足畏。寗願退出國聯。二謂國際種種約束不足懼满蒙問題。堅拒第三者干涉。旣視九國公約非戰公約爲廢紙。又視一切正義人道和平爲假面具。而深信武力爲萬能。含有苟不利日。則日不惜與舉世挑戰之意。具有此種觀念者。雖不敢謂爲舉國一致。然而軍人派。則敢决其必爲一致之主張。我人由此一點觀察。將來國聯開會。發表調查結果。果眞主張正義公道。則日人所將採取之手段。今日已可預言也。</p>
<p>反之。國聯調查之結果。竟爲武力所威脅。不能主張正義公道時則我國人又將奈何。日人本不依賴國聯。而依賴自已貨眞價實之武力一旦不满於國聯。可以任我自由。我國則向來依賴國聯。而又無貨眞價實之武力可恃一旦失望於國聯。我又將如何應付。日人雖依賴武力。然於外交方面亦皆力爭先着。特使專員。出奔馳。調查宣傳。多方活動。其布置之周備。早爲人所共見而我國外交上之布置。又詎能望其項背。則將來外交亦告失敗。我又將如何應付。我國人思之。重思之。倘臨到此最後嚴重之關頭。我國人之所以自救者安在。</p>
<p>雖然。我國人所以自救之决心。固不應待至最後嚴重關頭而始下之日軍佔據東北不退。且進而攻熱河。認僞組織。如此步步進逼。國人早應大下决心不過我國人一方面雖努力犧牲奮鬭。一方面猶徘徊觀望於國聯調查之能主持正義公道。以爲我最後之。援助。設至最後。國聯竟無力以主持此正義公道。或國聯縱主持正義公道。而日本不受國聯之判斷。任意自由行動。則斯時之形勢。必更較目前爲危急。我國人而再從容暇豫。不早準備所以自救。則此後尚有容我自救之日耶。故吾以爲處今日之情勢。不必問國聯調查之結果如何。而當齊心一致以努力於此最後之犧牲。</p>

<p>老北風威震海城</p>
<p>日僑民寢饋不安</p>
<p>北平通信、海城來人談、第二軍區遼南救國軍、自八月上旬發動後、曾一度稍事休息、其後仍奉到第二次總攻之命令、而於八月中旬作第二次之活動、一月以來、迄未稍息、遼陽·海城、營口·大石橋等地之南满鐵路車站、爲其攻襲之目標、功勛屢建、兹將最近戰况分述如下、</p>
<p>四襲海城　張海天（即老北風）爲名震遼西之一英雄、其部下曾三次襲撃海城、一爲八月一日之總攻、二爲三日、三次爲八月中旬之某日、數次襲撃、均無恙而退、但日軍往攻時、則反受其害、時被包圍、因之海城之日本軍警婦孺、畏之如虎、恒喃喃祈禱老北風不再至、二十三日夜、臨近海城之某小村、有病者送崇、燃放爆竹、日軍疑爲老北風又至、乃競相逃避、及天明、遣偵探往訊、始知眞相、乃遷怒村人、當即用砲火將該村洗刦、事爲第二軍區代理總指揮李純華知悉、乃眞遣老北風往襲、二十六日、即與日軍接觸、入夜、攻入南满站、此時日軍已將其界内僑民、移入守備隊軍營内、竭力保護、我軍數次猛撲、但因日軍砲火過盛、未得攻入、乃僅將日站界内之建築物、破壞焚燬、一夜火光冲天、及天明後退、海城日本之精華、經張海天四次之襲撃、已摧毁大半矣、</p>
<p>毁南满路　大石橋管榖瀋陽·營口·旅順·等處、爲交通中樞、關係李重、因之日</p>
<p>軍最近由旅順增調一聯隊、（隊號未悉）駐守該處、嚴加防範、二十五日夜八時許、義軍殷元民部、由岳州廟突出、約同由湯池北上之獨立支隊匡部、恊力夾撃、日軍因衝鋒之勢甚猛、無力抵抗、乃退入戰溝中、匍匐深處、不敢外出、但藉防禦工事、以密集之機槍及小鋼砲向義軍射撃、義軍則多衝至電網以前、割破突入、一方面以少數部隊、控制日軍前進、一方則以大部分散大石橋東站四週、將營口·旅順·瀋陽之鐵路諸幹線、從容拆毁、放數十砲而去、其後日軍則仍鳴槍不止、直至天明始停、旣出視、則已浪費兩時之子彈矣、</p>
<p>偷渡遼河　至於營口方面之義軍、自奉令作第二次總攻後、由十五日迄今、每日皆有接觸、無日不在奮鬥中、日軍爲斷絕義軍往襲之故將遼河上下游十五里以内之船隻、盡數扣留於南岸、以杜義軍來路、但義軍却上繞至葦塘附近偷渡至南岸、將大石橋至營口段之南满路破壞、因之營口支綫、時或不通、遼陽方面、半月以來、亦每日有戰事發生吳寳豐王全一兩部、已將遼陽西部之南满車站、加以包圍、用車綸戰法、每日輪流於南北兩方襲撃、每晚槍聲不絕、日本軍警、時有失踪、日人苦之、營口遼陽、義軍之活動、一則偷渡、一則輪襲、宛如中古時之戰術、亦一有興味之故事也、</p>
<p>日人恐慌　其次　遼陽市内、自尚吉元發動焚毁满洲紡紗廠倉庫後、凡日人雇傭華人者、皆岌岌自危、恐爲謀害、因之、凡在日本工廠商店家庭之華工、紛紛被解雇、日軍並厲行檢查市街、以防華人暴動、同時並疑警察與義勇軍聯絡、乃盡數調至城外、以之攻撃義軍、市内則另由各商店抽調壯丁、編成商團、由日人自任隊長及分隊長、但日人疑心過重、近又疑商團亦有通敵之嫌、時加逮捕、故各商團丁、皆惴惴不安、益思反正、大有一觸即發之勢、</p>
<p>日軍受脅　至南满沿綫之各小站、如他山·分水·立山·湯崗子·烟台·渾河等處、因義軍活動、南满列車多熄燈而過、義軍則出没無常、至於遼西之項忠義·裴景奎、則準備襲盤山·打虎山·溝帮子、遼東之鄧鐵梅部、則逼近本溪、日軍兩側、時受威脅、（九月二日）</p>

<p>天津通訊、本市海河、爲北運·子牙·大清·南運·永定·五大河之總匯、在民國十五年以前、河流暢達、一年四季、商輪吃水十五六尺者均可通行無阻、不料民國十六年伏汛期間、永定河山洪暴發、挾泥沙下瀉、以致海河淤墊七八尺、吃水十尺以上之商輪、非俟漲潮不能駛抵津埠、當時已引起市民之注意、厥後淤塞與年俱增、更引起東西人士之注意、本市原有海河工程局、年支經費百五六十萬元、係根據辛丑條約而産生、英美法日等領事、均爲該局董事、大權操於外人、雖年支巨額經費而不能認眞疏濬海河、至民國十七年商震爲河北省主席時、以治理海河、列爲</p>
<p>建設要政之一、於是集合專家、研究治標</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>治本兩個辦法、治本非兩千萬元莫辦、當時因欵項難籌、不能進行、治標僅須四五百萬元、即放淤永定河之泥沙於他處、再引清流入海河、其有效期約計二十年、於是乃組織整理海河委員會、發行整理海河公債五百萬元、以津海關二五附加捐</p>
<p>担保還本付利、經中央批准發行四百萬元、預計十八個月完工、不料大局多故、延至十九年始行開工、在北倉附近建築放水閘·節制閘·船閘·直至今年五月始行竣工、七月一日實行啓閘放淤、在塌河淀爲放淤區、約達二十五萬畝之面積、此放淤區均屬鹼地、不能播種五榖、乃因北面擋水堤尚未建築、至八月間所放洪水已漫溢淤區之外、遂將閘門關閉、而挾有泥沙之永定洪水、仍瀉入海河、淤塞如故、整理數年、耗欵數百萬、所得之成績、如是而已、現在該會尚有存欵不足百萬元、將以此欵挖築引水河、則引清水入海河、並購買淤區民地、預計至明年五月間、欵項用完、整理工程亦即告竣、在此工程未竣期間、尚有餘欵數十萬元、一班海外歸來之留學生、見此乃有人倡議、節省經費、歸併於華北水利委員會、然而整理海河委員會、以省主席市長爲正副會長、以津海關監督建設廳長爲當然委員、每人月支車馬費三五百元不等、自然反對歸併、迨至最近、省主席易人、内政外交兩部遂派孫世輔陳海超來津、會同財部指定津海關監督韓麟生、辦理歸併事宜、陳孫二氏抵津後、曾與韓麟生接洽數次、因省主席于學忠尚未就職、該會秘書長黄宗法、本係帮忙性質、毫無戀棧之心、但對於歸併問題、未便作主、必須經過全體會議、</p>
<p>方能解决、</p>
<p>據一般人之觀察、該會歸併、恐尚有問題、在接收方面所持理由謂、自九一八事變後、財政艱窘、全國均實行緊縮政策、整理海河委員會之治標工程、已完成十分之九、何必再糜公帑、應當歸併於華北水利委員會、以節糜費、而在整海委會所持反對之理由、則謂、華北水利委員會係設計機關、而非執行機關、前年接收順直水利委員會、幾年以來、除每日在大公報登載氣象報告外、殆無工作可言、整海委會在北倉建築水閘、阻遏洪流、引入清流、免却海河淤墊與年俱增、以便利海河商輪之交通、而放淤區域之鹼地、約二十五萬畝之面積、刻下每畝地價僅值一元、此次放淤、三五年後便成膏腴之地、每畝當值一二十元、此爲有利於農民及交通之顯著成績、况且海河工程局年耗百數十萬元、祇有幾隻挖泥船裝點門面、形同外國人養老院、今春工人罷工、宣言中曾有一條、指摘待遇懸殊、謂工程局在一位更夫（即守夜者）係西人、每月工資一百六十兩、華人更夫差役月僅十餘元、舉此一端、其他概可想見、整理海河委員會、擬俟將治標工程辦竣、即進行收回海河工程局、因爲整理海河委員會、乃直接治理海河之機關、海河工程局工作不力、自應交與海河委員會辦理、今若將整海委會歸併於水利委員會、恐無收回海河工程局之勇氣矣、（九月二日）</p>

<p>網球賽三比二勝嶺南</p>
<p>排球對英華發生問題</p>
<p>丨足球今日戰知行丨</p>
<p>二十軍球隊、昨日共分網球排球兩種比賽、網球賽以三比二勝嶺南、排球對英華、發生問題、兹將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>熱心體育之劉愼旃君　　劉君努力體育垂十二年曾捐欵創辦西南體育學校二十軍體育亦爲劉君首創</p>
<p>網球賽嶺南軍惜敗　下午二時起、在中華網球塲交鋒、原約定共賽雙打兩組、單打三組、但隔夜二十軍通知恊進會、謂因球員不齊、祇賽單打兩組、雙打一組、恊進會乃轉知嶺南、嶺南乃預備三組球員出塲、但臨塲後、二十軍又謂球員已齊、仍要求須賽五組、嶺南乃以三組球員分作五組比賽、勝負在所不計、結果嶺南失兩單打一雙打、勝單雙打各一組、以二比三朱敗、二十軍中球藝、以張理燊張洪雨較佳、頗穩健耐戰、結果如下、</p>
<p>單打（一）唐永純（嶺）勝柏梓衡（軍）一比六、六比四、六比二、</p>
<p>單打（二）張理燊（軍）勝林樂明（嶺）六比一、三比六、六比三、</p>
<p>單打（三）張洪雨（軍）勝陳吉祥（嶺）六比三、三比六、七比五、</p>
<p>雙打（一）陳吉祥·林樂明（嶺）勝張理燊·張洪雨（軍）六比四、七比五、</p>
<p>雙打（二）柏梓衝·廖繼莊（軍）勝鄧公俠·萬玉廷（嶺）六比四、六比二、</p>
<p>排球賽一塲無結果　排球賽對英華、在中華田徑場比賽、照規則因以五局三勝定勝負、但第三局終了、卽停止比賽、其比數爲二十一比十八、二十一比十四、十四比二十一、二十軍佔優、事後卽發生爭辯、記者因在網球塲、未知眞相、恊進會職員亦均在網球塲、故亦未知眞相之如何、事後則問兩隊、所得雙方之理由如下、（一）英華隊謂、事前且曾約定須以五局三勝定勝負、但三局終了、二十軍球員全體離塲、不再續賽、裁判員召之不及、無從比賽、（二）二十軍隊謂、當第三局終了、裁判員曾宣布敝隊勝利、故敝隊認爲比賽終了、故退塲、如敝隊無故退場、裁判員可宣布敝隊棄權、裁判員旣未宣布敝隊爲棄權、故敝隊實遵裁判員之判决、而非無故退塲云云、後恊進會找裁判員解决、但裁判員已他往、故一塲疑竇、無從解决、總之、比賽首重精神、勝負猶在其次、</p>
<p>今日足球戰知行　二十軍足球隊、今日與知行隊在中華棒球塲交鋒、定下午五時起、裁判已定沈回春、知行爲前届中華足球會之「華」字組冠軍、實力尚有可觀、惟目下因非足球季、技衛諒必减色不少、又二十軍本星期中之足球秩序如下、</p>
<p>九月七日對華東　三時半棒球塲　裁判陳吉祥</p>
<p>九月九日對嶺南　五時在棒球塲　裁判李思廉</p>
<h3 id="c86">最後二分鐘嶺南撃敗青華 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>三與二之比</p>
<p>丨夏令足球重要一幕丨</p>
<p>夏令足球賽、昨日有一場重要比賽、嶺南與青華在一部中皆未曾遭逢敵手、昨乃相遇於中華棒球塲、結果嶺南於最後二分鐘攻入青華一球、而以三比二勝之、裁判員蔣湘青、</p>
<p>嶺南先中二球　先青華以銳利之前鋒、猛攻數次、一次自左　二次自右、皆機會甚佳、而失於攻射不準、嶺南以堅强之後衛線、陳家球馮運佑、二支大柱、嚴密監視、於是進展至青華門前、朱志成踢角球、適落門前、陳洪光射之入網　其後雙方雖互有猛烈攻撃、皆歸無效、陳家球曾在離門三十碼地、遠射二次、急而烈、爲守門撲出可惜、下半局上場、青華仍有猛攻、但十分鐘時、嶺南左翼朱志成直進、急傳陳洪光、陳向右送、右翼唐文威將其送入、二比零形勢似定、</p>
<p>青華回成平手　但於將近完畢之十分鐘、形勢竟然大變、青華於五分鐘之中、連入二隻、造成均勢、先由中堅葉晉錦截得來球、向右翼曹秋亭送、曹在青華中、昨日爲一佼佼出色之將、捷步如飛、甚至陳家球出全力以監視之、爲一可造之才、其位置尚未能確當、須經過訓練而後可、曹後中央來球、一脚踏定、避向中傳、中鋒邵濟華攻入、不旋踵、率師又來、曹國榮在左射進、惡劣之形勢　頓時展開爲和平局面、　　最後之二分鐘　春雲初展、變化無窮、雖僅剩二分鐘、勝負决於此間、嶺南於極端優勢中　反爲和局、乃傾全力作背城之借一、作青華球門、團團圍住、於此人叢之中、左來一球唐文威頂之進網、三比二判分勝負、兩方表演、差堪满意可觀、陣線列後、</p>
<p>嶺南</p>
<p>黄達文　馮運佑　馮念漢　洪天爵　陳家球　黄君明</p>
<p>朱志成　彭廣新　陳洪光　歐陽永源　唐文威</p>

<p>宸樞　姚正剛　左永耀　陳耀平　葉晉錦　吳鑫祥</p>

<p>尚有其他二組比賽、結果爲（一）志華勝進德、一部、三比零、（二）青年勝嶺南乙、二部、三比一、</p>

<p>南京公餘網球隊來滬後、日昨原與優游比賽、因雨停止、昨日下午三時起、與中華網球隊在中華網球場比賽、共分雙打五組、採分數制、每組比賽零三盤、結果中華全勝五組、比數爲十三比二、第二組南京余志忠趙敏恒、對中華屠開元梁德光、第一盤共賽三十六局、中華組以十九比十七勝、誠從來未有之紀錄、第二盤屠梁以五比零局佔優時、公餘余志忠不知何故、竟退場不賽、殊失運動人格、是組應作公餘棄權、中華以三比零勝、第一組中公餘隊之凌道揚、年逾四十、老當益壯、球藝頗稱不弱、各組成績如下、</p>
<p>（中華）（公餘）</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<h3 id="c102">政黨把人當做機器來使用 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 景記</p>
<p>八月三日，相老人病頗沉重，我往問候時，沉思片刻，告訴這幾句話。</p>
<p>「政黨政客，他們利用人民，在認爲人是機器，可以駕駛的；所以想盡方法，他們自已要成功一個使用機器者。我爲什麽主張民治？知道人人都有一個良心，有良心，按天理，便個個能自治，人民自已便是主人翁。」</p>
<p>稍後陳君來，報告東北事：相老人又舉例來說明民治與非民治的區别，說了：！</p>
<p>「記得普法戰時，普魯士的兵，大批的侵入法境，所有的給養，都就地籌助。法境本地的人，不得不供應了。可是他們都按時價，開一賬單，由普魯士的軍官簽字給他們保存。後來法國賠欵中，就扣下這一些的錢，還給那戰區損失中的人民。看來人家國家，重民治精神，以民爲重，歷來如此！」</p>
<p>「又記得長毛的時候，有紅頭到上海，上海富人如郁家等數鉅室，也被迫的供給一切。可是事後，地方官反而參奏，說他們通敵，結果一個個都治罪了。我們的國家，向來不保護人民，總是防備人民：即使到了國家危急的時候，外患深入，左右是人民遭難。看來不走民治這一條生路，那國難是没有根本救濟的方略：難道全國的人民，就坐看東北同胞被壓迫了事？」</p>

<p>丨幾條自省語丨</p>
<p>自民國成立以來，在學校·機關·團體之中，當舉行紀念週的時候，必有讀「遺囑」「靜默三分鐘」一回事。我想：總理的革命精神我們當然要欽佩，要牢記，正知太史公所說：「高山仰止，景行行止，雖不能至，心向往之」，可是天天讀遺囑，也許像小和尚唸經，有口無心，委實没有價值！至於靜默三分鐘，也許有一班人在這靜默的時候，來默想昨天打差了白板，給上家和了一副三抬，好不倒霉！又或默想：今天拿了薪工回去，買些什麽東西去送愛人？在這刹那三分鐘間，要是有「他心通」的本領，倒可編一部十萬字的心理小說</p>
<p>呢。現在在下有一個愚見，以爲舉行紀念週的時候，可編成幾條自省語，大家朗讀一回，眼·口·心三到，也許有些微效。學校裏可將自省語，寫作屏條，掛在教室，像「校訓」一般，收效尤偉。試舉自省語如下：（略舉四則，以見一班）</p>
<p>我忘了日本人的佔據東三省嗎？</p>
<p>我忘了一二八的慘禍嗎？</p>
<p>我忘了關外義勇軍的堅苦抵抗嗎？</p>

<p>— 魯逵</p>
<p>「藝術大衆化」，這是近來大家都在提倡着，不錯，藝術是應該大衆化的，尤其是在現代的中國。現在中國的民衆，是需要一種通俗的；高尚的；前進的；大衆的藝術，來改造民衆的思想。但是眞正的大衆藝術，現在還没有産生，在這青黄不接的時代，用什麽來做引渡呢？有的人主張：在舊有民間藝術的幻殻裏，融和入新的生命，或者在思想上加以改良，作爲民衆精神的糧食。　　天一公司最近公映的「游藝大會」，是搜集一向在民間流傳較廣的歌曲，戲劇，雜藝；以及由西洋傳入的歌舞之類，搬演在銀幕上面，是一部純粹歌舞戲劇的有聲影片。它的題材，除固有的和新作的兩種以外，尚有不少用民歌的譜，編製新的歌詞，像道情「漁樵問答」；北曲「秋閨怨」；蘇灘「惜春光」；以及「船夫曲」「迎春曲」等。尚有一幕「蘇三起解」，是由十二位女星來扮演，用新式的歌舞方法，來表演平劇，更是别開生面。　　　我以爲該片的攝製，是一件民間藝術的綜合整理的工作。一方面供給大衆的欣賞，一方面供給藝術家的探討，多少收一點「藝術大衆化」的效果，確是一件有意義的工作。</p>
<h3 id="c106">摩登的佛法觀 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 鑾珍</p>
<p>丨菩薩才是摩登鼻祖丨</p>
<p>「摩登」這兩個字，在現代的階段裏却是最時髦的名詞。只要一提到是同現時代有關係的，無不用這兩個字來形容，而且也就可充分的表現一切的，别的也不須什麽形容詞了，所以現在一切必摩登，不摩登則不足以表示合乎時代。</p>
<p>但是，最引用這個名詞的，要算對於女郎了，在伊們本身固然是力求其摩登，而一般人們也常常是提及摩登女郎的，因此在這一點上，便替摩登這兩個字發現了一個新的源流，如果有人編百科大辭典，我想這是免不了要把它編入的。</p>
<p>這實在是引經據典而有考證，同時這來源也是由一般專門研究眞理（？）所謂拜佛唸經的考慮而來的，他們說「佛經上曾載過一段事實，我佛如來派阿蘭尊者來化緣說法，接度衆生，被魔所纒，最利害的一次，便是被一個名呌摩登伽女的迷惑，幾乎被伊破了身，因爲伊做妓女，而阿蘭尊者去作嫖客。」據說是去救伊的，但是不經如來佛打救，連尊者自已也救不到了，所以呢，現在的「摩登」便是由此而出，决無疑義的，而現在的摩登女郎便都是些魔鬼哩丨</p>
<p>「這個偉大的發現，摩登的男女們應當知道的，」菩薩大概會這樣說。</p>
<h3 id="c107">銀絲（五） <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>全鎭的人，不因爲伊是瘋子，不信任伊所講述的故事，是虚誇的瘋話；因爲他們都在報紙上早已見到了英姿颯爽而很威武的袁團長照片，並且還讀到了許多關於這鎭附近劇烈戰事的記載。</p>
<p>市政委員召集了當地的土豪，劣紳，和其他比較有錢的居户，開了幾次會，提議在鎭中小學的前面空地上，造一個紀念碑，紀念這位勇而有謀的袁團長；因爲在報上讀到一則新聞，說是這位袁人楷團長正是這鎭上的土土。所以諸伯方主張在碑上刻「捍衛桑梓」四個金字，這碑落成的時候，親自前來參加揭幕典禮。但是許多人，都反對他提出的四個字，尤其是高年齡的人，都說：報紙上所登載的籍貫，也許是不確實，新聞記者常喜歡過分的描寫，正和寫小說一般，因爲他在這鎭上立的功，便說他是本地人，我們鎭上的人，那裏來姓袁的人呢？所以「捍衛桑梓」，不必改爲「捍衛國家」。</p>
<p>當時有一位小學校長，他和市政委員是一派的，便說：鎭上怎麽没有姓袁的住？袁瘋子不是姓袁麽？我相信報紙的記載是不錯的，他們的外勤記者採訪新聞，最準確，又敏捷，怎麽會錯？我們鎭上有這麽一位英雄，不表揚出來，太殺自已的威風了。</p>
<p>「哈哈！那麽，袁團長是袁瘋子的丈夫，你也信任伊麽？」一位開米行的老板說。</p>
<p>「袁瘋子本是這鎭上的土著，不過伊從小便住在外面，後來又搬回鎭上住，難道這袁團」</p>
<p>長不是從小住在外面的麽？」小學校長抗辯着說。</p>
<p>討論的結果，紀念碑是一定要建立，大概用三千元造，刻的大字，决定用「闔鎭安寗，」一來是表示功在本鎭，二來是紀念碑乃本鎭捐造，三來鎭上也可以暗中鎭邪壓魔。最後主席市政委員補充了一句話：「各位今天都在這裏，我們對於鎭邪壓魔的話，只可以作爲私話，」</p>
<p>傳不得到政府去的，否則批駁在其次，鄙人的市政委員也要發生問題，總得各位多多帮忙！」一席話說完，便散會；再由諸伯方請吃了一碗麵，大家都很歡喜，自願去向各家捐欵，希望多多益善。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>以三不知著名（不知軍隊多少，不知金錢多少，不知小老婆多少，）的張宗昌氏，當時盤踞山東，炙手可熱，山東人民，受其荼毒，至今還令人談虎色變，</p>
<p>昨據報載，張宗昌在濟南車站，臨行突被狙撃，傷重斃命，當塲捕兇手二名，供認爲父復仇，噫！軍閥之下塲，不過如此，所謂良醫之子，多死於病，良巫之子，多死於鬼，即以其人之道，還治其人之身，原是一種報施不爽的公理，</p>
<p>不過我對於張氏從前種種，世人自有定評，我原不必加以深究，而對於張氏之死，是否應得，其中内幕，尚未明瞭，以前亦不必作深刻的評論，不過張氏生平，亦有一件可取的事，</p>
<p>「我自張宗昌，並不是張邦昌」，此種豪爽口吻，宛然如聞其聲，則張宗昌之對於東北傀儡行爲，亦是極端反對，則比較鄭孝胥熈洽臧式毅等一般狐羣狗黨，甘心助逆，爲虎作倀者，還是稍勝性的追逐唐森作</p>
<p>一籌，</p>
<p>當張之被刺時，有一刺客大呼，「我乃鄭金聲子之鄭繼成，替父報仇，」遂跳下鐵道，照準張之頭部，連發數槍，這個刺客亦是難得，平常刺客刺了他人，往往不肯把姓名說出，而鄭繼成先自通下名姓，亦不愧一條好漢，</p>
<p>自古好漢惜好漢，狺狺惜狺狺，本不該自相殘殺，但是冤仇相遇，分外眼明，張之快人快語，碰着鄭繼成亦是快人快語，狹路相逢，而張宗昌遂不得不死於仇人之手矣，</p>
<p>或曰張宗昌此行，當有其他活動，並不如報紙所云，料理産業糾紛，則這篇死賬，我亦不來管他矣，</p>

<p>— ·小·桃·</p>
<p>諸位！在未看這篇紙之前，請想一想，假若現在世界上没有紙的話，人們會感覺到多麽困苦啊！紙旣是不可缺少的一件東西，牠的製造我們怎能不知道呢？現在我把紙的製造和歷史寫在下面；</p>
<p>我國古時没有紙，爲着要記錄已做的感應做的事，免得忘記，便削竹爲簡（即竹片），用漆在簡上寫字。也有在絹帛上或獸皮上，或植物的樞榦上寫字的，也有在石板上雕刻的，還有更愚笨的結繩記事。這些記事法，眞不方便極了。到了後漢和帝時，有桂陽人蔡倫，他很聰明，感覺着這樣寫字太不方便，便用蔴頭，破布，稻藁，蘆草這類的物質，設法造紙。有志者事竟成，他的發明果然成功了。他對於人類的供獻眞不小啊！</p>
<p>西洋各國造紙，以埃及人爲最早。</p>
<p>他們造紙的原料是蘆草。蘆草所造的紙，質料粗厚，書寫很難。等到我國造紙的方法傳入彼邦之後，奥，德，瑞典等國便大開紙業工廠，日加研究，從此我國造紙的方法便傳播全歐洲了。</p>
<p>西洋造紙的原料，是木材破布和爛紙。他們把買來的破布，爛紙放入割切器中切碎，放入除土機中除去爛紙上的泥土洗淨後。再放入大鐵罐中煑透，化去原來的各種色素，入漂白槽，加以漂白粉漂白，漂好後加以膠水，和白堊土，（白堊土可以增加紙的重量），然後入濾紙器，通過金屬網直接壓榨，以除去水分，入乾燥機，使壓榨後的紙即烘乾而出。我國紙之所以用墨水寫會破開，就是因爲在造紙時没有放膠水的緣故。　　我國所造的紙太少，時常供不應求　僅僅西洋紙的銷路無形的　大了。再因爲中國不能自造機器，又不能充分運用本國原料，所製成的紙纖維粗惡，旣不美麗，又不能用鉛筆，鋼筆二面書寫。毛筆雖然能寫，但是墨太淡，便把字滲成一個墨水團；若太濃了又滯着寫不上字，所以購者感覺西洋紙價廉而堅靱耐用，便爭趨購用洋紙，這種漏巵便格外的增大了，這是多麽值得我們特别注意的一樁大事啊！</p>
<p>據調查報告以日本一國入口的紙計算，每年的價值，約在二百零七萬四千零九十六兩，像這種鉅大的漏巵·眞可怕啊！</p>

<h3 id="c173">現在男女已否平等的研究 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 金·門·</p>
<p>男女平等：：男女平等：：自鼎革到現，已喊了二十餘年，試問現在的女子已否與男人平等了，這問題倘仔細研究起來，恐拍未的成分較已的成分爲多罷！　　我在未研究這問題的前，先要問究竟怎樣才是男女已臻平等了，這話一時也很難回答，可分「廣」「狹」二義，「狹義」就是男女一切待遇上的平等，「廣義」則須包括男女待遇上和權位上一律平等。</p>
<p>男女待遇上的平等，彼歐美各國當然很是平等，我國舊時所謂「男浪女藏」「三從四德」「七出之條」確不平等之極，但早受門户開放歐風東漸之賜，天然淘汰了，現在的女子確較前解放不少，若謂已與男人平等了，却還没有呢。</p>
<p>尤其是關於男女性的問題，爲待遇上最不平等，男子可以多妻，女人祇可一夫·男子可以在外嫖妓·女人不可在家偷漢·男人死了妻子馬上可以續娶，而且很應當的，女人死了丈夫，雖也可以再醮，但被公婆的留難，和親鄰的指摘，也夠氣煞她了，好像貞操二字，乃專對女子而用，與男人毫没關係的，眞是不平等極了。</p>
<p>但是社會上一方面大喊男女平等，一方面又這樣的束縛她們，爲什麽如此矛盾呢？這就是現在的女子，經濟還未獨立，生活上還要依賴男人的原因，舊女子固然如此，即新女子亦何嘗不然。　　對於女子一切權位上的平等，恐怕歐美各國也未到這程度，我國更不必說了，蓋有幾國政府裏除小職位和議員有幾個女子外，絕未有女子當選　　，或任總理和部長，也可知女子權位上和男人一律平等，很難辦到的。</p>
<p>至於男女二方，究竟誰是玩物，誰是奴隸，這乃相對的，都可以說，男人把新女子當作玩物，新女子也在把男人當作玩物，男人把舊女子當作奴隸，現在的新女子，把丈夫辛苦賺的錢，拿來　　登　看電影遊公園　　　　　　　霍，也在把男人當作牛馬呀！</p>

<h3 id="c174">一件怪事 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 影·呆·</p>
<p>前天從松江回來，打從愛文義路走過，偶然的發現了一件怪事丨一個西裝男子，他的年紀，大約是三十多歲了，手裏抱着一個小孩子，這孩子不過一周歲光景，從他的小面孔上看去，便可斷定他身體是不健全的，也許在害病吧？大概是先天的不足啊！那個西裝男子，一手抱着那孩子，還有一隻手裏夾着一疊紅紙做的小袋。</p>
<p>在他的前面，是一個年紀和他相彷的中年婦人，在形式上看去，他們當然是一對夫妻了。她的面上顯然是流露着一種憂鬱的色彩，縐緊了眉頭，没有絲毫的笑容，領了她的丈夫和孩子，沿着馬路旁的走道，由東而西的走去。</p>
<p>許多的人們，都圍住了他們在看熱鬧，好奇心催促了我，不由得停了步看一個究竟，才知道那個婦人走到每一家的門口，立停了脚，向主人嘰哩咕嚕的說了幾句話，那家的人，便把一個或是兩個銅元投入了她所拿的一隻紅紙的小袋之中，那婦人便把有錢的袋，授給了她的丈夫，同時在丈夫的手裏，換一隻</p>
<p>空的袋子，換一家再去討銅錢。</p>
<p>我目覩之下，眞是莫明其土地堂，他們夫妻倆看他們是很上等的人，爲何要向人家討錢呢？圍着的人，有的在歡笑，也許他們是同樣的和我在莫明其妙，有的在品評，後來我問了旁人，才知道他們在討百壽錢，要討一百家，因爲這孩子在害病，百壽錢是壓邪的，可把邪神和惡鬼趕掉的。</p>
<p>這眞是一件奇怪的事情，一個要飯的向人家討一兩個銅子，是多麽煩難，大多數還是不肯給呢，但他們夫妻倆討百壽錢，人們却都很慷慨的挖腰包給他們的，不到一個鐘頭，一百隻紅袋之中，都放满了銅元了，於是他們才從原路折回。</p>
<p>因爲看見了他們在討百壽錢，便使我發生了許多的感想，在我們鄕下，一般無智的愚民，家裏的孩子害了病，不去請醫生，專去求仙方，請道士，木人那會看病，道士豈可除妖，結果便使一般小國民遭受天卒之災，不料都市之中，連智識階級都如此的迷信。從表面上看去，那西裝男子和那穿着一雙革履的婦人，分明是智識階級，但他們的孩子害了病却不去請醫生，而用百壽錢鎭邪，豈非笑話！在這樣情形之下，中國人的迷信種子，不知到何年何日才會盡絕而消滅呢！</p>

<p>— 人·</p>
<p>隔壁張家正太太的寳寳和姨太太的囝囝在天井裏玩耍，寳寳佔着正太太勢力大，時常欺侮囝囝。可是囝囝也是小孩子家，怎麽甘心受辱？自然囉，這兩個天眞爛漫活潑的小孩子，便時常爭吵，甚至於扭作一團，小足小手打起來了。因爲互相感着委屈，心頭充满寃氣，惟一的發洩，只有哭，於是哭聲傳入正太太的耳裏，她趕忙跑來，不分皂白，先在囝囝的小嘴巴上掌了幾下，便抱了寳寳到街門口，口口聲聲慰着，「寳寳，别哭，爹爹回來買洋囝囝給你。」可是，他仍然哭着，一直到他媽從洋貨店裏拿着洋囝囝回來，她的小寳寳才破涕爲笑，捧着洋囝囝，好像忘了剛才的事。</p>
<p>那邊，囝囝挨了嘴巴，當然更哭得凶，姨太太看見，使着氣抱着到亭子間裏去，關門着讓他哭，可是她並不慰他，但用着恐嚇的調子，「囝囝，你還要哭嗎？當心外國人捉你去！前天對門的阿官爲着哭，給黄髮碧眼睛的洋鬼子捉去挖眼睛，做肉包子，：：：」囝囝没有聽完，駭着爬過來將小臉躱在媽的懷裏，半天半天，還不時從他細弱的氣管裏嘔出聲聲的怨氣來。</p>
<p>這樣的把戲，差不多在我放工回來，天天看見，我便心裏充满着創痛和悲哀，我想：中國的母性教導孩子便是如此的嗎？：：哦，我明的了！原來中國人的「歡喜洋貨」「崇畏洋人」的心理，是在天眞爛漫的幼稚時代，便由做母親的一心一德地深深地種在他的孩子的幼弱的心靈上了。</p>

<p>— 渚·萊·</p>
<p>丨兒時的回憶丨</p>
<p>多麽寳貴的童年時代，已流水一般地消逝了！但我是歡喜小孩子的大孩子，只要看見他們天眞爛漫的態度，便欣然神往，深慕兒時的快樂。然而韶光無倒流之望，上帝畢竟不能賜我再做小孩子啊！本學期担任了一級最低的算術課，更和小弟弟小妹妹們接近起來：摸着笑容可掬的蘋果面孔，握着一雙纎纎的小手，看見穿着美麗的衣服，：於是覺得小孩子眞可愛了·</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>回憶我黄金一般地童年時代，在上學的第二年，每天總在廟裏頑皮。有一次，走到大村廟的側室裏，很胆大地拿了一隻泥做的天狗，丢得粉粉碎碎。歇了兩天，生一塲大病。在病中，據母親說：「你不時喊着小脚女人老太太又來了！因此，我着急得寢食難安，許願啊，請郎中啊，：忙得不亦樂乎！」歇了一星期，病好了，母親提了一香籃麵餅，捧着一大堆香燭元寳，很鄭重地領我到廟裏去祭太太。</p>
<p>大約八歲光景，每到四五月之交，和頑童們到竹園裏去摸鳥窼。如果摸着了白頭一類的小鳥，很高興地養起來，彷彿當牠小伴侣看待。可是日子久了，不是被貓兒吞去，便是活活地餓死。於是掘了小小的一方泥潭，把牠安葬在裏面。同時，泥面上揷了一些鮮花野草，眼眶裏灑了一包淚水，那未始不是傷心的紀念吧！</p>
<p>炎炎的長夏到了，每天清早起來，拖了一雙破布鞋，掮了一很長竹竿，東走西奔地捲蜘蛛網。其次，拿了一隻小籃，到河岸邊楊柳樹上去拾蟬榖。拾好了，一隻隻地穿在細白線上，掛在母親的房頭裏。一待鐺鐺的賣糖聲來了，就笑逐顔開地拿牠來換糖吃。</p>
<p>十二歲時，是同小友們賭博旺盛的一年，在每天來往的一條長路上，劃了一個梯形式的印界，作擲銅元的遊戲，一看見我的父親來了，便爭先恐後地直向廟裏逃去，散學了，又偷偷地到東宅上的張姓家去，坐在大門上，很快活地對香烟牌子，像我屢戰屢敗，而賭興却從未减低的！</p>
<p>六歲起，歡喜積大清白銅鈿，一五一十地穿好，很珍貴地擺在母親抽屜裏，到十一歲的一年，已長長地積了五百個大銅鈿了，眞快活啊，并且在那年起，我把八十個銅元，借給宅上酒仙老公公，每到廢曆十月中，有一百五十文利息到手，眞是满意，</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>這篇作品，赤裸裸地叙述出來，我深覺在童年時代，也是一個天字第一號的頑皮小孩，到如今，頷下有些鬍鬚樁了，而且家中最大的小孩，已足足有八歲了，撫今思昔，眞是天差地遠，判若二人，然而唯望一顆天眞爛漫的心靈，不要隨了年華而長逝呢？</p>

<p>The League of Nations investigation report, which has garnered worldwide attention, has been signed in Peiping.

The Chinese people eagerly hoped to glean some hints of the investigation's outcome while welcoming and seeing off the members, but Lord Lytton merely shrugged and smiled, revealing nothing. While the Lord could not make any statements beforehand, those concerned about the current situation were already disappointed. For the outcome of this investigation concerns not only China and Japan but the safety and security of the world as a whole. Therefore, the world is paying close attention. The Japanese have been actively probing and studying the results, trying to determine whether they favor China or Japan. Newspapers frequently publish their speculations, saying that if it's unfavorable to Japan, then what shall we do? If the major powers, like Britain and America, don't help Japan, what shall we do? The military faction's expressions have further revealed their intimidating intentions, repeatedly expressing their hard-line stance. One stance is that international condemnation is not to be feared; they would rather withdraw from the League of Nations. The second stance is that all sorts of international constraints are not to be feared; they firmly refuse third-party intervention in the Manchurian problem. They have already regarded the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact as scraps of paper, and they see all justice, humanity, and peace as masks, deeply believing that military force is omnipotent, implying that if it's unfavorable to Japan, Japan will not hesitate to challenge the world. Although it cannot be said that this view is universally held, the military faction can be certain to hold it as their unified stance. From this point of view, we can predict what measures the Japanese will take when the League of Nations convenes and announces the results of the investigation if it truly upholds justice and fairness.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the League of Nations' investigation is threatened by military force and cannot uphold justice and fairness, then what shall we Chinese do? The Japanese do not rely on the League of Nations but on their own genuine military force. Once dissatisfied with the League of Nations, they can do as they please. China has always relied on the League of Nations but has no genuine military force to depend on. Once disappointed in the League of Nations, how shall we respond? Although the Japanese rely on military force, they also strive to make the first move in diplomatic matters. Special envoys and commissioners travel and actively promote their cause. Their thorough preparations are already evident. How can China's diplomatic arrangements be compared? If diplomacy also fails in the future, how shall we respond? The Chinese people think about it, think about it deeply. If we reach this final, critical juncture, where will the Chinese people find their means of self-salvation?</p>
<p>However, the Chinese people's determination to save themselves should not wait until the final, critical juncture. The Japanese army occupies and refuses to withdraw from the Northeast, and further advances to attack Jehol, recognizing the puppet organization. With such step-by-step aggression, the Chinese people should have made a firm resolution long ago. However, while striving for sacrifice and struggle, the Chinese people still hesitate and observe whether the League of Nations' investigation can uphold justice and fairness, considering it their last aid. If, in the end, the League of Nations is unable to uphold this justice and fairness, or if the League of Nations upholds justice and fairness but Japan does not accept the League of Nations' judgment and acts freely, then the situation at that time will be even more critical than it is now. If the Chinese people remain leisurely and unhurried and do not prepare for self-salvation, will there still be a day for us to save ourselves in the future? Therefore, I believe that given today's situation, we should not ask about the outcome of the League of Nations' investigation but unite and strive for this final sacrifice.</p>

<p>(Peiping) The Lytton Investigation Team report, which the whole world eagerly awaits, was signed this morning at the German Hospital. Lord Lytton signed first, followed by the other four commissioners. The ceremony was held on the hospital's veranda. In addition to the commissioners of the investigation team, all the staff of the secretariat were also present, as well as hospital staff and other onlookers. Because the members of the investigation team had to make a long flight today, they worked until midnight yesterday and then went to bed. However, the staff of the secretariat worked until dawn to complete the procedures for the report. It is reported that the report is 400 pages long, totaling over 400,000 words. With the signing of the report, the investigation team ceased to exist. The team's last official act was to thank Dr. Ju Fanlai, the team's physician, for his hard work in caring for the health of the members along the way. Before leaving the German Hospital, Lord Lytton personally expressed his gratitude to Dr. Krieger of the hospital for his successful treatment. He then traveled by car from the hospital to the Qinghe airfield. The scenery along the way was quite interesting, as the Lord had rarely been outdoors since returning to Peiping from Japan. Cavalrymen were stationed quietly along the roadside to provide strict security. When the Lord and his party arrived at the airfield, Zhang Xueliang's luxurious Ford airplane was ready to depart. A crowd of people had gathered at the airfield to see them off, including British Chargé d'Affaires Inkley, German Minister Doddmann, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Anfuso, and other diplomatic personnel, as well as Chinese officials such as Wan Fulin and Yu Xuezhong, and staff members of the investigation team. When Lord Lytton arrived, several platoons of Chinese soldiers stood at attention, and military music resounded. Lord Lytton first greeted the two nurses from the German Hospital, who were wearing their white hospital uniforms among the well-wishers. The German Minister expressed that the German Hospital was honored by Lord Lytton's visit, and Lytton smiled and praised the hospital, saying that he had benefited greatly from it and that he felt healthier than ever since arriving in China. He also admired the beautiful autumn scenery. As 10 o'clock approached, Zhang Xueliang arrived quickly by car, exchanged a few words with Lytton and others, and then sent them into the airplane, personally taking care of everything. The airplane carried nine passengers, namely Lord Lytton, General McCoy, Count Aldrovandi, Sir Charles Astor, Biddle, and Donald. The pilot was Hutton, with Cruz as the co-pilot. As the clock struck ten, the airplane soared into the air amidst cheers, circled the field once, and flew south. Before leaving, Lord Lytton told the guests that he had nothing to say except to inform them that the report had been signed. He later admitted in answering questions that the report had been unanimously agreed upon and that its contents would not be revealed to China and Japan until it was opened simultaneously in Geneva. A guest asked how the report would be sent to Geneva. Lytton replied that the original text would be sent to Europe by the fastest route, which was still to be decided, and that part of the journey might be made by airplane. A guest asked if Japan's current intention to recognize "Manchukuo" would change the effect of the report. Lytton smiled in response. The guest said that he recalled that during the previous meeting, it was said that the purpose of the investigation team was to find a basis for negotiation. He asked if this purpose had been achieved. Lytton replied that the purpose of the investigation team's mission to the Far East was to provide the League of Nations with a possible starting point and to find a way out of the dead end for China and Japan. The guest asked if Lord Lytton felt that the investigation team had achieved this goal in the report. Lytton shrugged and said that it was up to others to judge. Before departing, Lord Lytton also met with Chinese and foreign journalists, answering each question without revealing anything. For example, when asked about his impressions of the current situation in China, Lytton replied, "I hope to come to the Far East again in the future as a free man, so I can enjoy the beautiful scenery." After arriving in Shanghai, Lytton planned to take the Italian ship "Ganzhao" back to Europe. It is said that after arriving in Venice, he will go ashore to meet his daughter in Milan and then return to England. General Crowe of France and Dr. Schnie of Germany are scheduled to go to Harbin on September 12 and return to Europe via Siberia. Staff members of the secretariat will also travel with them. (4th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) French Commissioner General Crowe and German Commissioner Dr. Schnie left Peiping this afternoon, taking the route to Dalian and Harbin. (Last Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The League of Nations Investigation Team, including German and French commissioners Sheni and Claude, and Japanese representative Yoshida, arrived in Tianjin at 7:15 PM on the 4th. Representatives from our provincial and municipal governments went to the East Station to welcome them and dispatched military police to protect them. The German and French consuls in Tianjin hosted banquets for the commissioners of their respective countries. Yoshida did not get off the train. The Japanese Vice-Consul Goto boarded the train and talked with him for a long time. At 10:00 PM, they took a special train to Tanggu. On the morning of the 5th, they boarded the Changping Maru to Dalian. The team presented the Peiping-Mukden Railway Bureau with a commemorative document, on which were painted the flags of seven countries: England, America, France, Germany, Italy, China, and Japan, and signed by fourteen people, including the commissioners and secretaries of the seven countries. The document read: "The League of Nations Investigation Team, in order to maintain world peace and justice, came to China and Japan from March to September 1932. When the team, led by Chairman Lord Lytton, came to various places in North China, the Peiping-Mukden Railway Bureau was responsible for preparing cars and welcoming and sending them off, which is deeply appreciated. The following signatures are left as a memento." (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The "Sunday Times" learned today that the Lytton Investigation Team report can be sent to the League of Nations Secretariat within the next ten days. At that time, copies will be officially sent to the governments of the countries concerned, so that they may have the opportunity to study the report before discussing the matter in Geneva. (4th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The "Observer," based on the view that the Lytton report will criticize Japan's policy and that Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations, published an article today stating that those who advocate that Geneva take strong action should use their common sense and recognize that Geneva can do nothing but accept Japan's unfortunate withdrawal from the League. Japan has carried out its entire purpose, which is to seize China's three eastern provinces and organize "Manchukuo" as a Japanese dependency. There is no doubt that this matter is very sad, but the responsibility of politicians is to suggest any other feasible and constructive solution. The only strong country operating in the Far East today is Japan. This is the key point, and the incidental strategic purpose of the Japan-Manchukuo defense alliance treaty is to submit a fait accompli to Geneva when Geneva receives the Lytton report. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, then the three strong countries whose fates are most directly related to "Manchukuo," namely Japan, the United States, and Russia, will not be members of the League of Nations. This is one of the greatest complexities. (3rd Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Shandong Province continues to manage the canal. Today, Kong Lingrong, the Director of the Canal Works Bureau, went to Jining to supervise construction. According to reports, the construction of the East and West Si Rivers and the Niutou River is more than two-fifths complete. There are six or seven thousand workers in Zouxian. Construction in Jining was suspended due to high water levels but will resume immediately and will be completed in two months. 3,000 tons of American wheat have been received. If the canal is to be managed, it will require 6 million yuan, so the plan has been changed to have the counties along the canal contribute labor in the winter and spring to dig and repair the canal, so that it can reach the Yangtze River from the south bank of the Yellow River and reach Tianjin from Linqing, allowing the passage of steamboats. Also, Zhang Honglie, the Director of the Construction Department, said that Chief Technician Cao Ruizhi and Song Wentian, the Director of the Xiaoqing River Bureau, are currently in Tianjin, contacting the Dutch who are contracting to repair the Huludao, inviting them to Shandong to contract to repair the Yangjiaogou estuary project.

<p>And Was Done in Accordance With Government Orders</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yi Peiji replied to a letter from the Shanghai University Professors Association on the 4th, stating that the Palace Museum's disposal of items unrelated to history was decided by the board of directors in Beijing on April 4, 1929, and approved by the Executive Yuan on May 6, ordering the museum to implement it. Because the Palace Museum had a myriad of affairs to sort out, it did not have time to take it into account. It was not until June 1931 that it followed the government's orders and organized a temporary reorganization committee composed of representatives from the Beijing District Court, the Tianjin Garrison Command, the Peiping Municipal Government, Peiping University, and the board of directors of the museum to gradually implement it. The items disposed of included tea, medicine, furs, snuff, silk, ham, damaged goldware, seaweed, cosmetics, honey, etc. All of these items were thoroughly examined by the committee and confirmed to be unrelated to culture and history and could not be permanently preserved. There are records in the museum to verify this, and there are no antiques involved. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) The Japanese side has recently been promoting a telegram from Changchun to the Nanjing government and Zhang Xueliang in Peiping, which resembles a declaration from the puppet organization, demanding that they immediately stop the activities of the Volunteer Army, otherwise they will deal with them severely and await a reply. According to relevant sources, this telegram is purely intimidating in nature. It is said that Zhang has never received this telegram. It is not known whether Nanjing has received it, but since Zhang is no longer in office and is not the authority in North China, there is no need to reply. Furthermore, it is expected that the Japanese side's promotion of this is intended to induce the National Government to tacitly recognize the puppet organization as an equal organization. Therefore, it can be seen that even if Nanjing receives this telegram, it will certainly ignore it. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Preparatory Committee of the China Currency Revolution Association held its first preparatory meeting at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center on the 4th. Fang Juehui, a member of the Central Committee, Li Beikun, an instructor from the Central People's Movement Committee, Liu Mianzhi, the initiator, and representatives from various agencies and organizations, a total of more than 30 people, attended. The initiator, Liu Mianzhi, reported on the policy of currency reform, divided into four points: 1. The tickets are printed by the government, and everyone can issue them with one-tenth of their property or income as collateral, following the post office's approach, establishing first, second, third, and fourth-class bureaus to manage them on their behalf. As for the government, it can issue them as much as possible with one-fifth of its annual income as collateral. 2. The government promulgates the regulations for the Guarantee Committee, and guarantee members are organized uniformly in provinces, counties, villages, and townships across the country, with no limit on the number of members, classified according to the amount of property. For example, those with property of more than 5,000 yuan can be guarantee members of fourth-class bureaus, and those with property of more than 100,000 yuan can be guarantee members of first-class bureaus.

<h3 id="e18">Zheng Jicheng's Personal Account of the Assassination of Zhang <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zongchang's Coffin is About to be Transported to Beiping for Funeral Arrangements</p>
<p>Han's Telegram Clarifies the Truth to Various Parties</p>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, reporters visited Zheng Jicheng at the military law office. Zheng spoke freely about the reasons for and the process of assassinating Zhang, stating briefly: "I was raised and educated by my uncle, Jin Sheng, since childhood. If Zhang Zongchang had killed my uncle on the battlefield between two armies, that would have been each fighting for his own master, and there would be nothing to say. However, Zhang ordered Jiang Mingyu to lure my uncle to Jinan, where he was brutally murdered, and then offered a reward of 30,000 yuan to go to Tianjin to arrest me. I narrowly escaped twice by climbing over walls. Later, I fled to England. In the seventeenth year [of the Republic], after the success of the revolution, I returned to China and engaged in secret work for the party in Tianjin. I had long desired to kill Zhang to avenge my father and vent public anger, but I had no opportunity. Today, I have taken his life. He came here to die. I took the risk to kill him, firstly to bring glory to the party and the nation, secondly to add luster to the revolution, thirdly to eliminate a scourge for Shandong, and fourthly to avenge my uncle. Now, fortunately, the great revenge has been taken. I have long disregarded my own life and death. Last night, when I took a family car to the train station, I told my wife, Li Shufang, that if the great revenge were achieved, my death would also be your glory. My wife, understanding the greater good, did not behave in a childish manner and personally wrapped the pistol in a handkerchief for me and placed it in my pocket. I only got the news of Zhang's return to Beiping at 5:30. When I arrived at the station, Zhang had already gotten off the train. I followed Chen Fengshan and fired three shots in a row, but none of them went off. Zhang then fled onto the car. Zhang's followers had a total of four Mauser pistols and one handgun, and they all opened fire. At that time, it was extremely dangerous. Fortunately, after Zhang got out of the car, he was shot and killed by me. Chairman Han has now interrogated me and instructed me to wait for legal resolution. I am a revolutionary who killed a counter-revolutionary, and it is not only to avenge my father, etc." Zheng once served as the commander of the First Cavalry Brigade of the Northwest Army, the garrison commander of Chilin Town, and the commander of the Jingzhao Garrison. Since Jin Sheng was murdered, he has been raising death squads and forming alliances with heroic figures to avenge his father. Han has telegraphed Beiping and various important figures to report this matter and has spent 400 yuan to prepare burial clothes and 600 yuan to prepare a coffin for Zhang and Liu Huaizhou. Now, the coffins have been prepared and moved to the Anhui Ancestral Hall on Wanxin Street. Zhang's family has telegraphed from Beiping, saying that they will send Wang Jinyu to Jinan to discuss funeral arrangements. The Public Security Bureau has dispatched police to protect [the area]. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) After Zhang Zongchang's death, photos were taken by a photography studio. The body was washed and placed in a special ward of the hospital. Xu Xiaolou, Jin Shouliang, Cheng Rong, and others were present to take care of things. The words "Zhang Zongchang" were tattooed on Zhang's arm. His staff has telegraphed Beiping to report [the death]. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhang Zongchang's coffin is made of Phoebe zhennan wood, costing 475 yuan. Zhang's mother sent a telegram from Beiping, requesting a car and arranging to transport the coffin back to Beiping on the 6th. One of Zhang's wives in Shanghai saw the news of Zhang's death in the newspaper this morning and telegraphed to inquire whether it was true. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, Jinan newspapers were sold out due to the news of Zhang's death. Some were selling for as much as 20 cents a copy. Zhang was 51 years old this year. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Zongchang's family in Beiping received a telegram from Jin Shouliang, reporting the circumstances of Zhang's assassination in Jinan. Zhang's mother, upon hearing the news while ill, was deeply saddened. This morning, she sent her eldest grandson, Jile, to report the news to Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Zhang Huanxiang, and others. Zhang's mother originally intended to have Zhang's remains collected in Jinan and transported back to his ancestral home in Yexian, but due to inconvenient transportation, it was decided to first transport them to Beiping for funeral arrangements. Her son, Jile, is now going to Jinan to welcome Zhang's coffin to Beiping. Zhang's family is in a state of decline. He had two sons, the eldest, Jile, is 24 years old, and the younger is 19 years old. He had one daughter, and his mother is 72 years old. Before Zhang left Beiping, he ordered Wang Qi to meet with Yu Xuezhong at his private residence. Upon meeting, he entrusted his two sons to him, asking him to take care of them in the future. He sighed with emotion, not expecting that it would be a final farewell. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Li Zaojun and Wang Qi are responsible for preparing Zhang Zongchang's funeral arrangements. Wang Xiangting is going to Jinan to assist with funeral affairs and aftermath. Wu Peifu, Zhang Xueliang, Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezhong, and others personally went to Zhang's residence this afternoon to offer condolences. Han Fuqu telegraphed Beiping last night, reporting that Zhang had been assassinated by an enemy and that the assassin had been detained at the military law office. Today, Han telegraphed various parties again, declaring the truth of the matter and stating that the rumors circulating outside were not factual. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>160,000 Members Paraded Yesterday</p>
<p>The Brown Shirts Retreat</p>
<p>The Position of the von Papen Government is Consolidated</p>
<p>The Plans of the Nazi Party are Sure to Fail</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 3rd – The plot by the National Socialist Party and the Catholic Centre Party in Prussia and the central united front to overthrow the von Papen government is destined to fail. This is the impression of both official and unofficial circles, as well as the attitude of the monarchist and military factions. The Steel Helmet League gathered in Berlin before members of the cabinet and the royal family, and the party leader made a grand speech. There is no doubt that they are united and share each other's fate. The desolate atmosphere that prevailed in Berlin a few days ago has been completely dispelled by the spirit of the Steel Helmets. Since Hitler left, the brown-shirted troops of the National Socialist Party have not reappeared on the thoroughfares, and the disturbances they previously caused have subsided. Those who have replaced the brown-shirted troops are the Steel Helmets in gray uniforms. The Steel Helmets will hold a gathering parade tomorrow, with a number of 600,000 people. It is generally believed that the von Papen government will continue to move forward, unperturbed by party movements, and it is expected that the von Papen government will hold central and Prussian power for a long time. Therefore, general confidence in the future is gradually increasing, as evidenced by the fact that the stock exchange also believes that the domestic political future is very optimistic, and market prices have risen accordingly. The rumor that Dr. Schacht will soon be appointed as the official in charge of managing various private businesses subsidized by the state has not yet been confirmed by the government, but the government acknowledges that this position will have to be established in the future.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 3rd – The assembly held at the stadium yesterday was nothing less than a political movement of the Steel Helmet League. The leaders declared, "This organization, which has always been supra-partisan, has now become the shield of the von Papen cabinet." The sports event held in the afternoon in the Krunewald district was more populist, with various sports that Germans love, such as shooting, throwing bombs, the use of field telegraph and telephone lines, the practice of gas masks, and unpowered aircraft. As many as 60,000 people attended. The purpose of this kind of sports is to train reserve forces, since the German army organization should not have reserve forces. Tomorrow morning, there will be an "autumn parade" held in the Tempelhofer Feld. Formerly, Wilhelm II would hold a military parade there every year, and the name "autumn parade" is to commemorate Wilhelm's past. It is particularly noteworthy that this kind of sports is of a formal nature. Figures from the republican government, the Prussian government, and the imperial era, such as the deposed Crown Prince and his two brothers, as well as senior army and navy officers, gathered here, and the Italian ambassador to Berlin and representatives of the White Russians also attended. From this evening, 150,000 members of the Steel Helmet League will gather in Berlin, and 300,000 sausages and 30,000 liters of milk will be purchased to provide food, which is also a grand sight. The Berlin police have increased their numbers and are on alert to wait.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 3rd – An emergency decree to be announced within the next week includes a provision to protect domestic industries, imposing heavy taxes on goods that compete with German-made products, and in some cases doubling the existing tax rates. The details are not yet known, but it is heard that office supplies such as typewriters and calculating machines are subject to double taxation. American businesses concerned have asked Washington to find a way to negotiate and prevent the implementation of this order.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 4th – In a speech in Münster, Prime Minister von Papen announced that the main points of the economic program will be officially promulgated on Tuesday in the form of "alternative legal orders," signed by President Hindenburg. Special regulations will also be issued at the same time, signed only by the Prime Minister and the Ministers of Economy, Food, and Labor.</p>

<p>Reuters, Paris, 3rd – At today's French cabinet meeting, it was unanimously decided that, regarding the issue of armaments raised in the German memorandum, the signatories to the Lausanne Trust Pact and the United States should be consulted first, and then a written reply to Germany should be drafted. This is because the issue concerns all countries as a whole, not just France. The consultation will take some time, but the League of Nations conference three weeks from now should promote this consultation. French public opinion generally hopes to contact the signatories of the Trust Pact and reject Germany's request to restore its armaments, because the French believe that Germany's request not only undermines the disarmament conference, but also hinders the success of the world economic conference.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 3rd – Italian Prime Minister Mussolini held a lengthy meeting today with German Ambassador Schubert to discuss the German memorandum to France regarding the reorganization of the army. Schubert informed Mussolini of the key points, and no communiqué was issued afterward. It is generally believed that this conversation was extremely important, because disputes often arise between Italy and France. Italian newspapers commented on the German document in a gentle tone, and well-informed sources expect that when various countries exchange opinions on Germany in the future, Italy will express sympathy toward Germany.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 3rd – It is rumored in various circles of the League of Nations that Germany does not wish to participate in the disarmament conference again until the issue of military equality is resolved. This rumor is apparently based on the declaration in the memorandum submitted by Germany to the disarmament conference on July 20. Therefore, the League of Nations expects that German representatives may not attend the resumption of the disarmament conference's budget committee on September 12.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Yamamoto, Angered by Unilateral Decisions, Expresses Intent to Resign</p>
<p>Amendment to the Rice Law Vetoed by the House of Representatives</p>
<p>Organization of a Joint Committee of Both Houses for Re-examination</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 4th – The government held a cabinet meeting at 9:30 last night and decided to extend the session by another day. Minister of the Army Araki then entered the palace to report to the Emperor, who approved it. The government's reason for extending the session for the third time was that it was due to clerical matters such as printing bills. In fact, it was because the Seiyukai disagreed with the amendments in the House of Peers to the Rice Law Amendment Bill and the Central Treasury Law for Debt Consolidation, and a compromise could not be reached, so a joint committee of both houses was needed. However, this was also unexpected by the government, and the Seiyukai's attitude became increasingly dangerous. Shimada Toshio (Seiyukai) criticized the government at the plenary session of the House of Representatives, saying that if such an important bill as the Rice Law were shelved due to incomplete deliberation, the government should bear a heavy responsibility. The government turned pale upon hearing this, changed its previous proposal, and requested an extension of the session.</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 4th – Minister of the Interior Yamamoto was extremely angry after countersigning the imperial decree extending the session for the third time. Saito, the prime minister, had not consulted the interior minister about the extension of the session beforehand, and he suddenly demanded that the interior minister approve it, which he already resented. At the same time, he learned that the Seiyukai was using the extension of the session to facilitate its own operations, which made him even more angry. He then expressed his serious determination to Prime Minister Saito, intending to leave his post in anger. Ministers Nagai and Goto tried their best to appease him, and Matsuda, the director-general of the Minseito Party, and Machida, the director-general, also rushed to hear the news, asking him to exercise restraint and value his position, and things finally calmed down. However, the interior minister is still resentful and uneasy, and his actions are quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 4th – The plenary session of the House of Representatives reopened at 8:40 last night. Speaker Akita reported that the House of Peers had deleted the amendments of the House of Representatives in the Money Debt Mediation Bill and the Rice Law Amendment Bill and returned them to this House. He then asked whether the amendments of the House of Peers were acceptable. It was then decided to accept the Money Debt Mediation Bill, but the Rice Law Bill was deemed unacceptable and vetoed. Speaker Akita declared that since the amendments of the House of Peers to the Rice Law Bill had been vetoed, a request should be made to the government and the House of Peers to convene a joint committee of both houses in accordance with Article 55 of the Diet Law. He then declared that in accordance with Article 56 of the Diet Law, this House should elect ten members of this House to attend the joint committee as representatives. Then, Tsuun Kunikuri of the Seiyukai moved that the speaker appoint the members. After the speaker finished appointing the members, there were three recesses. The session reopened for the fourth time at 10:35 p.m. Speaker Akita said that an imperial decree had just been issued to extend the session, and ordered everyone to stand up. Then, he read the imperial decree extending the session. Speaker Akita also reported that the Rural Debt Consolidation Association Bill had been amended and returned by the House of Peers, and it was decided to include it in the joint committee of both houses. The session adjourned at 10:40 p.m.</p>

<p>Parliament to Adjourn Today</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 4th – Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto stated the following in response to questions from the Seiyukai at this morning's joint committee of both houses: The survey by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is not entirely satisfactory, even to the government authorities, so it is proposed to consider other matters and decide on production cost standards. Therefore, the atmosphere in the Seiyukai is particularly relaxed, and it seems that they will approve the House of Peers' amendment to the Rice Law Bill. If so, a compromise between the two houses on the Rice Law Amendment Bill will definitely be reached.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e58">Struggle of the Liaonan National Salvation Army <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>"Old North Wind" Shakes Haicheng</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Live in Unease</p>
<p>A correspondent from Beiping reports that people from Haicheng say that the Second Military Region's Liaonan National Salvation Army, since its launch in early August, rested briefly. Afterward, they received orders for a second general offensive, and began their second campaign in mid-August. For a month, they have not rested. The South Manchuria Railway stations in Liaoyang, Haicheng, Yingkou, Dashiqiao, and other places are their targets of attack, and they have repeatedly performed meritorious deeds. Recent combat situations are detailed below.</p>
<p>Four Attacks on Haicheng: Zhang Haitian (i.e., "Old North Wind") is a famous hero in western Liaoning. His troops attacked Haicheng three times: once during the general offensive on August 1, twice on the 3rd, and a third time on a certain day in mid-August. Each attack resulted in a safe retreat, but when the Japanese army attacked, they suffered harm instead, sometimes being surrounded. As a result, the Japanese military police, women, and children in Haicheng fear him like a tiger, constantly praying that Old North Wind will not come again. On the night of the 23rd, in a small village near Haicheng, a sick person sent to Chong set off firecrackers. The Japanese army suspected that Old North Wind had arrived again, and fled in panic. When dawn broke, they sent scouts to inquire and learned the truth, so they transferred their anger to the villagers and immediately used artillery fire to wash the village away. When Li Chunhua, acting commander-in-chief of the Second Military Region, learned of this, he truly sent Old North Wind to attack. On the 26th, they made contact with the Japanese army. At night, they attacked the South Manchuria Railway station. At this time, the Japanese army had moved its residents within the Japanese boundary into the garrison barracks, doing its best to protect them. Our army launched several fierce attacks, but due to the excessive Japanese artillery fire, they could not break in. They only destroyed and burned the buildings within the Japanese station boundary. The night sky was filled with firelight. By dawn, the Japanese essence of Haicheng had been largely destroyed by Zhang Haitian's four attacks.</p>
<p>Destroying the South Manchuria Railway: Dashiqiao manages transport to places like Yingkou, Lushun, and Shenyang and is of critical importance. As a result, the Japanese army recently transferred a regiment (regiment number unknown) from Lushun to be stationed there and strengthen defenses. Around 8:00 PM on the 25th, the insurgent army led by Yin Yuanmin emerged from Yuezhou Temple and, together with the independent contingent led by Kuang, advancing north from Tangchi, coordinated their attack. The Japanese army, because the momentum of the attack was fierce, had no strength to resist, and retreated into the trenches, crawling deep inside, daring not come out. However, using defensive works, they fired at the insurgent army with dense machine guns and small cannons. The insurgent army mostly rushed to the electric fence, cutting it open and breaking in. One part of the insurgent army controlled the Japanese army's advance, while the majority scattered around the east station of Dashiqiao, calmly dismantling the main railway lines to Yingkou, Lushun, and Shenyang, and firing dozens of cannons before leaving. Afterward, the Japanese army continued firing non-stop until dawn. After going out to inspect, they had wasted two hours' worth of bullets.</p>
<p>Stealthily Crossing the Liao River: As for the insurgent army in Yingkou, since receiving the order for the second general offensive, there has been contact every day from the 15th until now, with no day without fighting. To cut off the insurgent army's attacks, the Japanese army confiscated all ships within fifteen miles upstream and downstream of the Liao River, keeping them on the south bank to prevent the insurgent army from crossing. However, the insurgent army bypassed the Japanese forces near the reed marshes and stealthily crossed to the south bank, destroying the section of the South Manchuria Railway from Dashiqiao to Yingkou. As a result, the Yingkou branch line is sometimes impassable. In Liaoyang, battles have also occurred every day for the past half month. The two units of Wu Baofeng and Wang Quan have surrounded the western South Manchuria Railway station in Liaoyang, using a "wheel battle" tactic, taking turns attacking from the north and south every day. Gunfire is constant every night. Japanese military police sometimes go missing, much to the suffering of the Japanese. The insurgent army's activities in Yingkou and Liaoyang, with stealth crossings and rotating attacks, resemble tactics from the Middle Ages, making it an interesting story.</p>
<p>Japanese Panic: Secondly, in Liaoyang city, after Shang Jiyuan launched the burning of the Manchuria Spinning Factory warehouse, all Japanese employers of Chinese are in a precarious situation, fearing being harmed. As a result, Chinese workers in Japanese factories, shops, and homes are being dismissed. The Japanese army is also strictly inspecting the streets to prevent Chinese riots. At the same time, they suspect that the police are in contact with the volunteer army, so they have transferred all of them outside the city to attack the volunteer army. In the city, they have drawn strong men from various shops to form merchant corps, with Japanese serving as captains and squad leaders. However, the Japanese are overly suspicious and recently suspect that the merchant corps are also colluding with the enemy, and they are making arrests from time to time. Therefore, each merchant corps member is anxious, and thinks of defecting, with a situation that is about to explode.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Threatened: As for the small stations along the South Manchuria Railway, such as Tashan, Fenshui, Lishan, Tanggangzi, Yantai, and Hunhe, because of the activities of the insurgent army, South Manchuria Railway trains mostly pass with lights off. The insurgent army appears and disappears unpredictably. As for Xiang Zhongyi and Pei Jingkui in western Liaoning, they are preparing to attack Panshan, Dahushan, and Goubangzi. Deng Tiemei's unit in eastern Liaoning is approaching Benxi. The Japanese army is threatened on both sides (September 2nd).</p>
<h3 id="e59">General Headquarters Orders Hubei Provincial Government to Implement Austerity Policy <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Monthly Government Expenses Not to Exceed 700,000</p>
<p>Six Measures Prescribed for Raising Bandit Suppression Funds</p>
<p>A correspondent from Hankou reports that regarding the problem of reorganizing Hubei Province's finances, the Three Provinces Bandit Suppression General Headquarters has sent personnel to investigate and formulate a plan. Yesterday, the Hubei Provincial Government received instructions from the General Headquarters to implement austerity policies, effective October 1st, and to implement a new budget. Six measures have also been drafted for raising bandit suppression funds, to achieve temporary reconciliation of income and expenditure. The original text of the instructions is as follows: "After investigating Hubei Province's local finances, the deficit has grown significantly. The Headquarters has sent personnel to investigate and hold meetings to discuss the current situation of income and expenditure, and determined a direction for reorganization: (A) Implement an austerity policy to seek a balance of regular income and expenditure. According to the Finance Department's report, monthly income is 1,194,500 yuan, and monthly expenditure is 1,893,964 yuan, with a monthly deficit of 700,000 yuan. If this continues, the annual deficit will be 8 million yuan, and the accumulated debt will be higher, making it more difficult to remedy. Fifteen years ago, Hubei Province's monthly government expenses were only 300,000 yuan. Even when Director Zhang took office, it was only 500,000 yuan, which was enough to maintain the current situation. It is up to the heads of the province to recognize that this kind of procrastinating is dangerous and ill-advised. Endure the pain for a while, implement an austerity policy, and adopt the principle of living within your means. Revise the new budget for the 21st year, and redistribute the monthly income of 1,194,500 yuan: (1) The total amount of monthly government expenses is limited to 700,000 yuan, which should be discussed by the provincial government and distributed separately among the various agencies and items. Matters related to education and security are important government affairs and should still have maintenance considered amidst the frugality; (2) According to the original Finance Department, another 300,000 yuan per month is used as a public debt fund and to repay loan principal and interest to protect credit. After the principal and interest are paid off, this amount will be used for provincial construction; (3) The remaining 194,500 yuan is the expense of the Security Office and the Administrative Inspector, and for temporary aftercare, rural restoration, and reform of public administration. To strictly implement the method of limiting monthly expenditure to 700,000 yuan, it is even more necessary to endure the pain and strictly implement the following three things: First, cut. Any redundant agencies or non-urgent matters that can be cut should be cut directly. Second, reduce. The expenses of all agencies or matters should be reduced at the same time, taking into account the actual situation. Third, merge. Any agencies or matters that can be merged should be merged and handled. The annual expenditure should be reduced to the predetermined standard based on this principle, and the new budget for the 21st year should be prepared and sent to the Headquarters for approval within half a month. The implementation of the new budget should begin on October 1st. Hereafter, any increase in expenses for various agencies should be prohibited in principle. If there are important and unavoidable matters, funds should be raised to offset them, so as not to repeat the old mistakes; (B) Raise new revenue to seek temporary reconciliation of income and expenditure. Bandit suppression work is related to the safety of the overall situation and is also the basis for reorganizing the province's various financial resources and construction projects. The total amount required each month is (1) Bandit suppression expenses for the troops stationed in Hubei are 226,540 yuan; (2) Special expenses are 93,000 yuan; (3) Military Commission bandit suppression expenses are 200,000 yuan; (4) The 21st Army's military expenses are 170,000 yuan; (5) Zhang Liansan's military expenses are 30,000 yuan. The total monthly amount is more than 640,000 yuan. Sufficient funding is needed for six months, totaling more than 3.8 million yuan. To raise this need, six measures have been approved: (1) Encourage the sale of public bonds, municipal public bonds, and aftercare public bonds. The unissued amount is more than 3.18 million yuan, which should be raised in the shortest possible time; (2) Sell official property and business. This refers to industries other than the official money bureau and public property. Large properties should be selected, such as the beach on Parrot Island and White Sand Island, and bid for sale; (3) Sell the Hanyang Iron and Steel Company steel rails detained by the province. The Ministry of Railways has previously sent personnel to Hubei to negotiate prices. The Headquarters should telegraph the Ministry of Railways to quickly negotiate prices and set payment in installments; (4) Clear Class A debt. The provincial government should invite representatives of Class A debt to discuss and modify the central old cases, local new cases, and the first and second programs, based on the situation. Negotiate the number of cash payments to meet urgent needs; (5) Collect rent. Hubei should follow Jiangsu's precedent and collect one month's rent in Hankou City for urgent use; (6) Recover the accounts from various counties. They should follow Zhejiang's urging method, post notices, and strictly urge settlement to emphasize public funds. The reorganization of regular income and expenditure measures mentioned in Item A and the reorganization of temporary income and expenditure measures mentioned in Item B should be handled by the provincial government, based on the actual situation, and reported for approval. In addition to distribution, this order should be followed." (September 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e60">10th Division Recovers Huang'an County <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Feng Xiuri and Environs See Three Days and Nights of Bloody Fighting</p>
<p>Nearly 10,000 Bandits Wounded or Killed, Dozens of Melee Battles</p>
<p>Bandits Flee to Deep Mountains After Li's Troops Enter the City</p>
<p>A correspondent from Hankou reports that after departing from Guangshui, the 10th Division under Li Mo'an advanced toward Huang'an, successively occupying Xiadian and Hekou. On August 10th, they arrived at Hekou Town and immediately supervised their troops to launch an attack on Huang'an City the next morning (11th). At 7:00 AM that morning, the vanguard made contact with the bandits near Dazhaojia and fought fiercely for several hours. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed, fleeing toward the Dongyue Temple and Tongan Village. The 30th Brigade of the Li Division tracked and pursued them. After arriving near Dongyue Temple, they discovered that about 10,000 or more Red Bandits were stubbornly resisting in the fortresses of Guihualou, Liangtinggang, and Hejiajui, high ground. After the vanguard of the Li Division arrived, they occupied the high ground at the southern end of Dongyue Temple to cover the deployment of the main force, and used a portion to suppress the bandits in the area south of Guihualou, threatening their flanks. At this time, the fierce bloody battle in the Dongyue Temple area had gradually begun. At this moment of urgent artillery fire, Division Commander Li took the lead and personally went to the high ground west of Feng Xiuri to observe the position, supervise and direct, and occupy the vicinity of Dongyue Temple. Captured Red Bandits of the pseudo-11th Division confessed that the bandit units were the pseudo-10th, 11th, 12th, and 73rd divisions, and there was also the pseudo-Independent 1st Division and Independent Regiment that had rushed from Yinjiahe overnight last night. From this, it can be seen that the Red Bandits clearly wanted to concentrate their main force to break through one point to achieve their conspiracy of defeating each one separately. At this point, Li's Division changed its strategy and decided to consolidate its defense on the north-south line of the Feng Xiuri high ground, using fierce firepower to suppress the enemy and gathering forces on the left and right wings to prevent them from taking the opportunity to encircle them. At 3:00 PM, the bandits came more fiercely and launched a general offensive on the entire line, with the pseudo-11th Division encircling the left wing of Li's Division. After a fierce attack by Li's Division, they gradually collapsed. In this battle, more than 1,000 bandits were killed or wounded, and more than 100 were captured. Ni Zhiliang, the commander of the pseudo-11th Division, and Wu Yunshan, the regimental commander, were seriously injured. At about 4:00 PM, the 28th Brigade of Li's Division launched an attack on the left wing. After a fierce attack, the first and second lines of defense of the bandits were broken through by Li's Division. At that time, the right wing of the bandits had extended to the Luo Jiazhui line, and most of the bandits took the opportunity to encircle the rear of the left wing of Li's Division. A regiment of the General Reserve Team of Li's Division and the units directly under the division immediately reinforced, engaging in melee battles dozens of times, and finally annihilating all the bandits without a single survivor. By this time, dusk had arrived, and Li's Division added fortifications to the original positions and maintained strict vigilance. It can be seen that they were brave and good at fighting to deal with five divisions of the enemy with one division.</p>
<p>On the 12th, the main line had been temporarily calm. At noon, when it rained heavily, a part of the bandits came to attack. They collapsed after being met by the left-wing troops of Li's Division. At 3:00 PM, most of the bandits suddenly moved to the left. At 4:00 PM, more than a dozen mounted pseudo-military officers led dozens of bandits to reconnaissance in front of the right-wing position of Li's Division. They were shot down by Li's Division with machine guns. Dai, the commander of the pseudo-Independent 1st Division, was also shot and killed near Li Chenglu. The bandits' repeated offensives were fiercely attacked by Li's Division, causing many casualties. At this time, the 83rd and 89th Divisions had gradually spread out on the left and right wings of Li's Division, and the Second Column had advanced to Qiliping. The bandits themselves were under greater threat.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 13th, Li's Division, seeing that the time was ripe, launched a large-scale attack on Huang'an. After fighting the bandits again in the Liangtinggang Tianma Temple area, they drove straight in. At 3:00 PM, they completely occupied Huang'an County. The remnant bandits were extremely embarrassed and fled to the mountains in the northeast. According to the people of Huang'an, the bandits suffered nearly 10,000 casualties in this battle and have completely collapsed.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Hai River Regulation Project Nearing Completion <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Hai River Commission's Dismantlement Still Problematic</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Hai River in this city is the confluence of the five major rivers: the North Canal, Ziya River, Daqing River, South Canal, and Yongding River. Before 1926, the river flowed smoothly, and merchant ships with drafts of 15 or 16 feet could pass unimpeded year-round. Unexpectedly, during the flood season of 1927, the Yongding River experienced a flash flood, carrying silt and sediment downstream, causing the Hai River to silt up by seven or eight feet. Merchant ships with drafts of over ten feet could not reach Tianjin Port without waiting for high tide. This drew the attention of the city's residents at the time. Subsequently, the silting worsened year by year, further alarming people both domestically and internationally. The city originally had a Hai River Engineering Bureau, with annual expenditures of 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan, established according to the Boxer Protocol. Consuls from Britain, America, France, and Japan served as directors of the bureau, with significant power held by foreigners. Despite the large annual expenditures, they failed to earnestly dredge the Hai River. In 1928, when Shang Zhen was Chairman of Hebei Province, he listed the regulation of the Hai River as</p>
<p>one of the major construction policies. He then gathered experts to study both temporary and</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>permanent solutions. The permanent solution required no less than 20 million yuan, but due to difficulties in raising funds at the time, it could not be implemented. The temporary solution only required four to five million yuan, which involved diverting the silt and sediment from the Yongding River elsewhere and then introducing clean water into the Hai River. Its effective period was estimated to be about 20 years. Therefore, the Hai River Regulation Commission was established, issuing five million yuan in Hai River regulation public bonds, secured by a 25% surtax on Tianjin Customs duties</p>
<p>for principal and interest repayment. The central government approved the issuance of four million yuan, with an estimated completion time of 18 months. Unexpectedly, the overall situation was turbulent, and construction only began in 1930. Water release gates, control gates, and ship locks were built near Beicang, and only completed in May of this year. On July 1st, the gates were opened to release the silt, with the Taha River Depression serving as the silt disposal area, covering an area of approximately 250,000 mu. This silt disposal area was mostly alkaline land, unsuitable for planting grains, because the northern water retaining dikes had not yet been constructed. By August, the released floodwaters had overflowed beyond the silt disposal area, so the gates were closed. However, the Yongding River's floodwaters, carrying silt and sediment, still flowed into the Hai River, causing silting as before. Several years of regulation, costing millions of yuan, achieved only this result. Currently, the commission still has a remaining balance of less than one million yuan, which will be used to excavate a water diversion river to bring clean water into the Hai River and to purchase private land in the silt disposal area. It is estimated that by May of next year, the funds will be exhausted, and the regulation project will be completed. During the period before the completion of this project, there are still tens of thousands of yuan in remaining funds. A group of students who have returned from overseas see this and some people are proposing to save money and merge with the North China Water Conservancy Commission. However, the Hai River Regulation Commission, with the provincial chairman and mayor as chairman and vice-chairman, and the Tianjin Customs Superintendent and Construction Bureau Director as ex-officio members, each receiving monthly transportation stipends of 300 to 500 yuan, naturally opposes the merger. Recently, with a change in the provincial chairman, the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs dispatched Sun Shifu and Chen Haichao to Tianjin to, together with Han Linsheng, the Tianjin Customs Superintendent designated by the Ministry of Finance, handle the merger. After Chen and Sun arrived in Tianjin, they contacted Han Linsheng several times. Since the provincial chairman, Yu Xuezhong, had not yet taken office, the commission's Secretary-General, Huang Zongfa, was only assisting and had no desire to cling to his position, but could not make a decision on the merger issue without a full meeting.</p>
<p>for resolution.</p>
<p>According to the observations of the general public, the commission's merger may still be problematic. The reason given by the receiving side is that since the September 18th Incident, financial difficulties have been severe, and the entire country is implementing austerity policies. The Hai River Regulation Commission's temporary solution project is 90% complete, so why waste public funds further? It should be merged with the North China Water Conservancy Commission to save expenses. The reason given by the Hai River Commission for opposing the merger is that the North China Water Conservancy Commission is a design organization, not an implementing organization. It received the Shunzhi Water Conservancy Commission a few years ago, and in the years since, besides publishing weather reports in the Ta Kung Pao every day, it has hardly done any work. The Hai River Commission built water gates in Beicang to block floodwaters and introduce clean water, preventing the Hai River from silting up year by year, to facilitate the traffic of merchant ships on the Hai River. Furthermore, the alkaline land in the silt disposal area, covering approximately 250,000 mu, is currently only worth one yuan per mu. After this silt disposal, in three to five years, it will become fertile land, worth ten to twenty yuan per mu. This is a significant achievement that benefits farmers and transportation. Moreover, the Hai River Engineering Bureau spends one hundred and several tens of thousands of yuan annually, with only a few dredging boats as window dressing, resembling a retirement home for foreigners. During the workers' strike this spring, one of the demands pointed out the disparity in treatment, stating that the foreman (i.e., night watchman) in the Engineering Bureau was a Westerner, with a monthly salary of 160 taels, while the Chinese foreman and servants only received ten or so yuan per month. From this one example, other aspects can be imagined. The Hai River Regulation Commission intends to take over the Hai River Engineering Bureau after completing the temporary solution project, because the Hai River Regulation Commission is the direct agency for governing the Hai River, and the Hai River Engineering Bureau's work is ineffective, so it should be handed over to the Hai River Commission. If the Hai River Commission is merged into the Water Conservancy Commission now, it is feared that there will be no courage to take back the Hai River Engineering Bureau. (September 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Jiangsu Province's Plan to Reorganize All Provincial Land <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Qilu Has Drafted Two Plans</p>
<p>Yesterday Went to the Provincial Land Bureau to Take Over and Inspect</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Jiangsu's land administration previously had a Land Reorganization Committee, headed by Chen Hexian. It was later changed to the Provincial Land Bureau, with Zhu Wenxin as the director. During this period of political tutelage, land administration is extremely important. It is insufficient to direct smoothly without raising the director's authority. Therefore, at the Provincial Government's 524th meeting, Chairman Gu proposed that the director of the Provincial Land Bureau be concurrently held by the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. After Director Zhao Qilu of the Department of Civil Affairs received the order, he drafted two plans for the overall reorganization of Jiangsu's land, a three-year plan and a five-year plan, both extremely complete. The three-year plan has a shorter timeframe, but requires more surveying instruments and talent cultivation. The five-year plan requires slightly fewer instruments and talent, but has a longer timeframe. The total expenditure is budgeted to be between 30 and 50 million yuan. The provincial government believes this matter is of great importance and has assigned the directors of the Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction to jointly review it, so that the overall land policy will advance to a more perfect state. Zhao also advocated simultaneously raising the authority of the county bureaus. Therefore, at the Provincial Government's 525th meeting, a proposal was also passed for the county magistrates of Zhenjiang, Jiangning, and Qingpu to concurrently serve as directors of the land bureau. The internal organization of the Provincial Land Bureau itself is also striving to be strengthened. It is heard that a secretary will be added to assist in management. Zhao already went yesterday (September 2nd) to take over and gathered staff for a sincere speech. The review of the entire reorganization plan will be completed in the shortest possible time. Details will be explored and published subsequently.</p>

<p>The Zhu Case's Situation Is Becoming Increasingly Serious. Zhu Tieying, the editor of the Moye Daily, angered the county government by reporting on business taxes, resulting in a prison sentence and the closure of the newspaper. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that business leaders and local gentry have repeatedly requested County Magistrate Zhao in person to allow bail, but all requests have been denied. They then retreated to request that the judgment be sent out as soon as possible so that the defendant can appeal, but this was also rejected. He even said to detain him for ten or so days before talking. If local tabloids publish unfavorable news in the future, they will all be severely punished without leniency. This has caused merchants and residents throughout the county to feel indignant, saying that freedom of speech has been clearly stated by Premier Wang, and what the Moye Daily reported was also based on facts and was not inciting merchants to resist taxes. Whether Zhu's guilt is justified is another matter, but the newspaper was imprisoned for speaking out for the merchants, so the merchants should help him. Therefore, Zhu and others have been adding seals to various businesses for days, unanimously requesting bail. If this does not achieve the purpose, they are willing to sacrifice everything and make further demands. The situation is very serious.</p>

<p>Autumn Cocoon Market Opens on the 7th. The local Cocoon Industry Guild believes that the autumn fresh cocoons are about to enter the market, and the cocoon price and opening date should be discussed in advance to avoid temporary hesitation. Therefore, at 3 PM on the previous day (the 3rd), a general meeting of all members was held at the guild hall in Xujianong. Over 180 people attended, including Jiang Daoshan, Wu Shimei, Huang Zhuoru, Hua Zicai, Yang Mengqian, Gu Binsheng, and Gao Shufang. Hua Shaochun chaired the meeting. (1) He reported that "Our industry has been extremely declining in recent years, and last year's autumn cocoons saw fierce competition among various merchants, causing great pain. If we want to turn things around, we hope that fellow merchants will unite and jointly seek ways to revive Jiangsu." Regarding the taxes and levies that the cocoon industry should pay, the guild repeatedly requested exemptions during the spring cocoon season. The business tax on all cocoon merchants was approved for a one-year suspension, and the cocoon stove business tax collected by the Construction Bureau was also approved for suspension. The house tax for cocoon merchants was also approved for exemption. However, now that the autumn cocoon season is approaching, some collection agencies still have documents intending to collect taxes, which the guild has politely refused. (2) Discussed the price of this year's autumn cocoons and decided that the standard price for each dan of autumn fresh cocoons should be 40 yuan in silver dollars, with higher prices for better quality and lower prices for poorer quality. (3) Discussed the opening date of this year's autumn cocoon market and decided to set it for September 7th. Those who wish to delay are allowed to do so. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province Establishes a Radio Station. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, due to the rampant banditry in Jiangbei, has established a radio station and four branch stations to maintain communication with major ports such as Nanjing and Shanghai. The main station is the former radio station of the Construction Bureau, which was allocated to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The branch stations are the four that were temporarily established in Yangzhou, Gaoyou, and Qingjiang. It is now deemed necessary to establish formal radio stations permanently. Nanjing has also established a station. In addition, it can communicate with Jinan, Hangzhou, Ji'an, Beiping, and Hankou. The director of the main station was previously concurrently held as a voluntary position by a technician of the Construction Bureau. The foreman of the station is Dai Yuzao, who has held the position for three years and has also planned the affairs of the branch stations. Now that it is under the management of the provincial government, Dai is expected to be promoted to director. The monthly expenses of the main station are 435 yuan, and its staffing is 120 yuan for the director and foreman, 80 to 70 yuan for telegraphers, and 60 to 40 yuan for clerks. If another foreman is established, it would be 100 to 90 yuan. The rest are electricity, gasoline, and miscellaneous expenses. The Nanjing radio station is established at the embassy residence, and the director is Shen Weijia. The monthly expenses are 438 yuan, and its staffing is the same as the main station. It is heard that the director of the Beijing station has already received the generator and is expected to start telegraphing soon.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province's Opium Monopoly Implemented. The opium monopoly has been rumored for a long time. When the rumors were at their peak last month, it seemed that it would be realized immediately. Later, due to strong opposition from public opinion, the atmosphere gradually became quiet. Now, according to a friend's letter from Zhenjiang, the Opium Monopoly Bureau has rented a house on the riverside in Zhenjiang to work. A large batch of government opium has been shipped to Zhenjiang on the 22nd</p>
<p>and is scheduled to be implemented from September 1st. As for the organization of the monopoly agency, under the General Bureau, the 61 counties in the province are divided into 15 districts, each with a special office, and each office governs four to six counties. Each county has a monopoly sub-bureau. The monopoly method is completely different from the method of recruiting contractors when the monopoly was implemented in 1928. It is heard that a three-month trial period will be temporarily used. During the trial period, all offices and bureaus will uniformly recruit contractors. In addition to necessary expenses, the actual sales will be settled. After the trial period expires, the results will be assessed to determine the method. As for the contractors, the provincial General Bureau is managed by a Mr. Lu, and the remaining offices and bureaus have been contracted by Mr. Lu separately. The internal organization of the provincial General Bureau and each special office bureau are uniformly divided into three sections, with the first section in charge of general affairs, the second section in charge of operations, and the third section in charge of auditing.

<h3 id="e76">Petitions from Elementary Education Circles Across Various Regions to the Ministry of Education to Improve Elementary School Textbooks <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Restricting Book Merchants' Monopoly</p>
<p>Rewarding Private Authorship</p>
<p>Representatives from elementary education circles in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places, including Chen Heqin, Shi Renfu, Jiang Xicen, and Yi Kexun, totaling several dozen people, jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Education yesterday (the 2nd), requesting rewards for private authorship and restrictions on the monopoly of book merchants, in order to improve elementary school textbooks and illustrations. The original petition stated: "Upon investigation, elementary school textbooks and illustrations in European and American countries mostly adopt a free review system. The main reason for this is to allow private individuals to freely compete, so that they can continuously improve and excellent versions can emerge repeatedly. Since China has had textbooks, it has also adopted this system. However, while the name allows private competition, in reality, two or three shrewd book merchants manipulate and monopolize, leaving no room for freedom. These two or three book merchants believe that elementary school textbooks and illustrations have a very wide market and are therefore a major source of profit. Thus, when editing, they employ penniless writers at extremely low wages, directing their work and setting time limits, only seeking to copy old versions and quickly produce books, disregarding the needs of the times and the psychology of children, and lacking any ideal or purpose. When printing, the illustrations are simple and crude, colors are completely absent, the text is kept short, and the paper is reduced as much as possible, in order to minimize costs and maximize profits. For distribution, they widely establish salespersons, bribe those in the education circles, and engage in various activities, using all means to expand sales, regardless of the methods used. Therefore, although their products have many titles, the content remains unchanged, repeating old patterns until the present day. There is no shortage of individuals in the education circles who are knowledgeable, experienced, and capable of writing better elementary school textbooks and illustrations. However, when they sell their manuscripts, the book merchants are sure to suppress the price, so that they gain little despite exhausting their efforts. When it comes to taxation, the book merchants turn a blind eye, and they cannot find patrons everywhere they look. If they print themselves, they lack both capital and distribution channels, making it absolutely impossible to compete with the book merchants. Even if there are one or two small book merchants willing to pay royalties and undertake the printing of their works, they are inevitably swallowed up by trusts due to their limited funds and weak strength. Therefore, even those with ambition hesitate and turn back, not daring to try. Because the book merchants manipulate and monopolize at the top, and private individuals hesitate and turn back at the bottom, there is no hope for improvement in China's elementary school textbooks and illustrations. The damage this causes to education is truly beyond words. We have heard that the central government, due to the poor quality of elementary school textbooks and illustrations, has considered hiring experts to edit them themselves. This would certainly correct the abuses of the book merchants' monopoly. However, this matter is of great importance and is not easy to accomplish. This is because the writing and editing of elementary school textbooks and illustrations requires an objective attitude and the use of scientific methods. The creation of each word and sentence often requires exhausting one's efforts. Even composing old poems is not as easy as writing textbooks and illustrations for middle school and above, and it is even less like writing papers or novels, where one can write thousands of words with ease. Therefore, the government will find it difficult to find experts to recruit, and the costs will be enormous, and the completion of the books will be difficult. This is all within expectations. We believe that the simplest way to improve elementary school textbooks and illustrations is to adopt a free review system, on the one hand rewarding private authorship and on the other hand restricting the monopoly of book merchants. We humbly present the following specific methods: 1. The Ministry should issue clear commendations or provide bonuses for outstanding and innovative elementary school textbooks and illustrations after they have been reviewed and approved, in order to show encouragement. 2. If excellent books are published by book merchants and the author receives royalties, the Ministry may, after review and approval, instruct the education administrative organs of various provinces and cities to order the elementary schools under their jurisdiction to give priority to adopting them. 3. Stipulate that the principle for the creation of elementary school textbooks and illustrations should be royalty payments, and the Ministry should order all book merchants to comply. 4. The Ministry should order the education administrative organs of various provinces and cities to instruct elementary school education administrators and school faculty and staff not to accept subsidies or preferential treatment from book merchants, except in cases where they have a publishing relationship with the book merchants. Those who accept subsidies and lobby for sales on behalf of the book merchants will be immediately dismissed upon discovery, and those whose circumstances are more serious will be prosecuted for bribery. If both reward and restriction are taken into account, the effect of private competition can be seen, and there will be no worry that elementary school textbooks and illustrations will not be continuously improved and excellent versions will emerge repeatedly. The central government can also sit back and watch the improvement of textbooks and illustrations, without having to consider self-editing. We are either elementary school teachers who secretly hope for textbook improvements, or have served as authors, understanding the malpractices involved. Therefore, we dare to comprehensively present our views, respectfully requesting review, approval, and implementation. The future of elementary school education truly depends on it." It is reported that the Ministry of Education will consider adopting the petition after receiving it.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Jiangsu Education Department Orders to Raise the Level of Middle Schools (1) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to forward the plan to raise the level of middle schools for compliance and strict implementation. The order to the county education bureaus states: "Since the director of this department took office, he has formulated the policy guidelines for the second half of the 20th year of the department, and the fourth item in the improvement of provincial and county education is 'effectively raising the level of ordinary middle schools.' Subsequently, the Jiangsu Education Three-Year Plan was formulated, and the eighth item in the phased implementation is 'reorganizing ordinary middle schools.' However, the former plan only listed the outline and did not specify detailed methods. Now, a plan to raise the level of middle schools has been formulated, and the principles and methods have been listed separately, which can serve as a standard for implementation. However, it has been found that the teaching of each subject in each school often fails to predetermine a plan of action, and the selection of materials for the Chinese language subject is particularly lacking in standards, resulting in a failure to see increased effectiveness. It is especially important to formulate a teaching plan for each subject in accordance with the aforementioned plan within one month after the document is received, and submit it for review. In addition to distributing it separately, the aforementioned plan is printed and distributed, ordering the directors of the bureaus to forward it to all public and private middle schools under their jurisdiction for compliance and strict implementation. This order."</p>
<p>Plan to Raise the Level of Middle Schools (Passed by the Tenth Departmental Meeting on August 26, 21st Year)</p>
<p>The curriculum of middle schools in this province varies, and the content is not substantial enough, resulting in uneven student levels and inadequate academic abilities. In order to seek balanced progress, there must be a unified plan.

<p>Commendation Order from the Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<p>Since Dr. Liao Shicheng took over as the director of Guanghua University Affiliated Middle School in this city, it has been five years, and the reputation has been outstanding. This summer, he was hired by the Jiangsu Education Department as the principal of a special teacher training school, but Mr. Liao firmly declined the position and still focused on running Guanghua Affiliated Middle School. It is now reported that the number of students this semester will be nearly 600, and the teachers hired are not employed elsewhere, so that they can focus on education. The Municipal Education Bureau commended the school for its serious management, stating that Mr. Liao, the director of the school, has rich experience in managing secondary education, the internal organization is well-organized, the teaching is also very serious, the school spirit is upright, and the equipment, such as the library, laboratory, music room, drawing room, and other special venues, has everything it should have.

<p>Tennis Match: 3-2 Victory Over Lingnan</p>
<p>Volleyball Match: A Problem Occurred Against Yinghua</p>
<p>Soccer Match: Today's Battle Against Zhixing</p>
<p>The 20th Army ball team had two competitions yesterday: tennis and volleyball. In the tennis match, they won 3-2 against Lingnan. In the volleyball match against Yinghua, a problem occurred. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Shenzhan, Enthusiastic About Sports Mr. Liu has been working hard for sports for 12 years and has donated money to establish the Southwest Sports School. The 20th Army's sports program was also first established by Mr. Liu.</p>
<p>Lingnan Army Narrowly Lost in Tennis Match The match started at 2:00 PM at the China Tennis Court. It was originally agreed to play two doubles matches and three singles matches, but the 20th Army notified the Coordination Association the night before, saying that due to the lack of players, only two singles matches and one doubles match would be played. The Coordination Association then notified Lingnan, and Lingnan prepared three groups of players to play. However, after arriving at the venue, the 20th Army said that the players were complete and still requested that five matches be played. Lingnan then divided the three groups of players into five matches, regardless of the outcome. As a result, Lingnan lost two singles and one doubles, and won one singles and one doubles, losing to Zhu by a score of 2-3. Among the 20th Army, Zhang Lishen and Zhang Hongyu had better skills, and were quite steady and resilient. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Singles (1) Tang Yongchun (Lingnan) defeated Bai Ziheng (Army) 1-6, 6-4, 6-2</p>
<p>Singles (2) Zhang Lishen (Army) defeated Lin Leming (Lingnan) 6-1, 3-6, 6-3</p>
<p>Singles (3) Zhang Hongyu (Army) defeated Chen Jixiang (Lingnan) 6-3, 3-6, 7-5</p>
<p>Doubles (1) Chen Jixiang and Lin Leming (Lingnan) defeated Zhang Lishen and Zhang Hongyu (Army) 6-4, 7-5</p>
<p>Doubles (2) Bai Zichong and Liao Jizhuang (Army) defeated Deng Gongxia and Wan Yuting (Lingnan) 6-4, 6-2</p>
<p>Volleyball Match: No Result A volleyball match was played against Yinghua at the China Athletic Field. According to the rules, the winner was determined by the best of five sets, but the match was stopped after the third set. The score was 21-18, 21-14, 14-21, with the 20th Army in the lead. A dispute then arose. Because the reporter was at the tennis court, he did not know the truth. The staff of the Coordination Association were also at the tennis court, so they also did not know what happened. Afterwards, both teams were asked, and the reasons obtained were as follows: (1) The Yinghua team said that it had been agreed in advance that the winner would be determined by the best of five sets, but after the third set, the 20th Army players all left the field and did not continue the match. The referee could not call them back and there was no way to play. (2) The 20th Army team said that when the third set ended, the referee announced that our team had won, so our team believed that the match was over and left the field. If our team had left the field without reason, the referee could have announced that our team had forfeited. The referee did not announce that our team had forfeited, so our team actually followed the referee's decision and did not leave the field without reason. Afterwards, the Coordination Association looked for the referee to resolve the issue, but the referee had left, so the doubt could not be resolved. In short, the spirit of the game is the most important thing, and victory or defeat is secondary.</p>
<p>Today's Soccer Match Against Zhixing The 20th Army soccer team will play against the Zhixing team at the China Baseball Field today, starting at 5:00 PM. The referee has been set as Shen Huichun. Zhixing was the champion of the "Hua" group in the previous China Football Association, and its strength is still considerable. However, because it is not soccer season at the moment, the skills will probably be reduced. Also, the 20th Army's soccer schedule in the middle of this week is as follows:</p>
<p>September 7th vs. Huadong 3:30 PM Baseball Field Referee Chen Jixiang</p>
<p>September 9th vs. Lingnan 5:00 PM Baseball Field Referee Li Silian</p>
<h3 id="e86">Lingnan Defeated Qinghua in the Last Two Minutes <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>A Ratio of Three to Two</p>
<p>An Important Scene in the Summer Soccer League</p>
<p>In the Summer Soccer League, there was an important match yesterday. Lingnan and Qinghua had never encountered opponents in Part 1. Yesterday they met at the China Baseball Field. As a result, Lingnan scored a goal against Qinghua in the last two minutes and won 3-2. The referee was Jiang Xiangqing.</p>
<p>Lingnan Scored Two Goals First Qinghua's sharp forwards attacked several times, once from the left and twice from the right, with excellent opportunities, but they failed due to inaccurate shooting. Lingnan's strong defensive line, Chen Jiaqiu and Feng Yunyou, two great pillars, closely monitored them. Then, progressing to the front of Qinghua's goal, Zhu Zhicheng kicked a corner kick, which landed in front of the goal. Chen Hongguang shot it into the net. Afterwards, although both sides had fierce attacks, they were ineffective. Chen Jiaqiu had two long-range shots from 30 yards from the goal, which were rapid and fierce, but were unfortunately saved by the goalkeeper. In the second half, Qinghua still had fierce attacks, but after ten minutes, Lingnan's left winger, Zhu Zhicheng, went straight in and quickly passed to Chen Hongguang, who sent it to the right. The right winger, Tang Wenwei, sent it in, and the score was 2-0, and the situation seemed set.</p>
<p>Qinghua Returned to a Tie But in the ten minutes near the end, the situation changed dramatically. Qinghua scored two goals in five minutes, creating a tie. First, center-back Ye Jinjin intercepted the ball and sent it to right winger Cao Qiuting. Cao was an outstanding player in Qinghua yesterday, with swift steps. Even Chen Jiaqiu tried his best to monitor him. He is a talent that can be developed, but his position is not yet accurate and needs to be trained. Cao then sent the ball to the center, and center forward Shao Jihua scored. Soon after, the leader came again, and Cao Guorong shot in from the left, and the bad situation suddenly turned into a peaceful situation. The Last Two Minutes Spring clouds were initially displayed, and the changes were infinite. Although there were only two minutes left, the outcome was determined in this period. Lingnan was in an extremely advantageous position, but was tied, so it put all its efforts into making a desperate move towards the Qinghua goal, surrounding it tightly. In this crowd, a ball came from the left, and Tang Wenwei headed it into the net. The score was 3-2, and the victory or defeat was determined. The performance of both sides was satisfactory and worth watching. The lineups are listed below:</p>
<p>Lingnan</p>
<p>Huang Dawen Feng Yunyou Feng Nianhan Hong Tianjue Chen Jiaqiu Huang Junming</p>
<p>Zhu Zhicheng Peng Guangxin Chen Hongguang Ouyang Yongyuan Tang Wenwei</p>
<p>Qinghua</p>
<p>Chen Shu Yao Zhenggang Zuo Yongyao Chen Yaoping Ye Jinjin Wu Xinxiang</p>
<p>Cao Guorong Fu Zhibin Shao Jihua Zhang Zhifang Cao Qiuting</p>
<p>There were two other matches, and the results were: (1) Zhihua defeated Jinde, Part 1, 3-0; (2) Qingnian defeated Lingnan B, Part 2, 3-1.</p>

<p>A Result of Thirteen to Two</p>
<p>After the Nanjing Public Workers Tennis Team came to Shanghai, they were originally scheduled to play against Youyou the other day, but the match was stopped due to rain. Yesterday afternoon, starting at 3:00 PM, they played against the China Tennis Team at the China Tennis Court. The match was divided into five doubles matches, adopting a scoring system. Each match consisted of zero to three sets. As a result, China won all five matches, and the score was 13-2. In the second match, Nanjing's Yu Zhizhong and Zhao Minheng played against China's Tu Kaiyuan and Liang Deguang. The first set consisted of 36 games, and the China team won 19-17, a record that has never been seen before. In the second set, when Tu and Liang were leading 5-0, Public Workers' Yu Zhizhong left the field for some reason, losing his sportsmanship. This match should be counted as a forfeit by Public Workers, and China won 3-0. In the first match, Ling Daoyang of the China Public Workers team was over 40 years old and still going strong, and his skills were quite good. The results of each match are as follows:</p>
<p>(China) (Public Workers)</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang Qian Yaobin defeated Ling Daoyang Zhu Longyi 6-3 4-6 6-1</p>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan Liang Deguang defeated Yu Zhizhong Zhao Minheng 19-17 5-0 Forfeit</p>

<h3 id="e89">Great Changes in the Gold Market Last Week <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The result was a rebound of 8.2 taels</p>
<p>There were drastic fluctuations in the gold standard last week, with daily fluctuations ranging from five or six taels to over ten taels. People were unsettled, with varying demands and supplies. Initially, overseas silver markets continued to rise unabated, so the opening price for October fell to 690.5 taels, and a low price of 686.2 mace had already appeared. However, the local foreign exchange market was loose at first and then tight, soaring beyond 10 taels. Subsequently, prices rose and fell rapidly, fluctuating around 700 taels. Later, international silver markets and U.S. cotton, etc., generally declined, and the Shanghai market for British and American exchanges also appeared bullish. The market situation was strong, breaking through the 710 tael mark, and by Friday, it reached a high of 711.9 mace. Unexpectedly, local sentiment was panicked, affecting the market, breaking through the 700 tael mark. By the weekend, domestic and foreign exchange markets diverged, and the market softened, ultimately closing at 701.2 mace. Comparing this with the previous Saturday, there was a rebound of 8.2 mace, reversing a cumulative decline of over 50 taels over the past five weeks. The difference between the highest and lowest prices throughout the week was 25.7 taels, and the difference between the opening and closing prices was an increase of 10.07 taels. The spot market was active, and the Central Bank repeatedly absorbed gold, sometimes using U.S. dollars to offset it. The naked price initially increased by 11 taels and then decreased to a little over 9 taels. The amount of gold traded was approximately 24,000 taels. Guangbang Hengxing still held short positions, while the most prominent long positions were held by Yifeng Yong, Qian Changxiang, and Yuanxing Yong. As of yesterday, large bars of silver had already seen a rebound, and the gold market may be difficult to advance further. The high and low prices of the silver market and exchange rates for the week are listed below:</p>

<p>It is customary for the remitting market to be quiet every Sunday, but yesterday's Sunday was exceptionally calm. The gathering and dispersing times of both the morning and afternoon markets were extremely short, only about two or thirty minutes, which is at least half an hour longer than usual. The scarcity of transactions is imaginable. The morning market remittance rate remained at around 9 fen, calculated as 6 qian 9 fen 0 li 2 hao 5 si. The afternoon market rate was 6 qian 9 fen 0 li 5 hao. The transaction amount for remittance drafts was only 70,000 in the morning market and only 160,000 in the afternoon market. The silver remittance rate was 5 fen in both the morning and afternoon, and the transaction amount for remittance drafts was also small, only over 5 million. Qianzhuang (native banks) and silver firms collected and remitted over 21.1 million, and foreign firms collected and remitted over 3.9 million. Remittances from various routes totaled over 300,000. Transactions in small qianzhuang were only 300,000 to 400,000. The price of Jiangnan small foreign coins was 5 qian 9 fen 7 li in both markets, with a transaction volume of 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of Guangdong small foreign coins was 5 qian 8 fen 5 li 2 hao 5 si in the morning market and 5 qian 8 fen 5 li 3 hao 7 si half in the afternoon market, with transaction volumes of 95,000 jiao in the morning market and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins continued to decline by 500 wen, to 432,500 wen, with transactions of over 46,700 strings of wen.</p>

<p>Weekly Report on the Bond Market Before and After Settlement</p>
<p>The price stagnation is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The total transaction volume for the entire week was only over 7.6 million.</p>
<p>During the past week (from August 29th to September 3rd), the bond market in the local securities market was generally very quiet. On Tuesday, the market was closed for one day to handle the settlement of August futures. On the remaining days, trading opened as usual, but the market remained very sluggish. This state of inactivity was unprecedented. The total transaction volume for spot trading for the week was only 21,200 yuan. For futures, only the September contract was active, with more activity in the troop disbandment salt tax bonds. Other contracts were scarce, with daily transactions only around 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan, totaling 7,655,000 yuan. Although trading in the October contract had commenced, there were no transactions. Moreover, the environment was very dull before and after the month-end settlement. There were no new developments in diplomatic and domestic situations, and market sentiment became more cautious. Trading was scarce, and the supply and demand were balanced, causing prices to stagnate, which was rarely seen. Except for the consolidation 6 bonds, which had a difference of 2.5 yuan due to dividend exclusion, the remaining bonds fluctuated only around 6 to 7 jiao. As a result, compared to the previous week, there were mixed gains and losses. The consolidation 6 spot and the financial September contracts each fell by 7 to 8 jiao, while other futures contracts mostly gained around 3 to 4 jiao. Observing the bond market, the quiet environment and the brewing of various situations led to increasingly stagnant prices and increasingly scarce transactions. In the near future, if there are no new developments in the situation, it will be difficult to expect a turnaround in the market. The high, low, rise, and fall of various bond prices during the past week are listed in the following table (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (the 2nd), United States Steel Corporation took the lead in surging, and railway stocks then rushed to new highs. When industrial stocks rose, railway stocks slightly declined. Utility stocks only became active before closing. According to the Federal Reserve report, credit and cash have increased, and sentiment is becoming more positive. The total transaction volume for the day was 3.5 million shares.

<p>General Sentiment is Bullish</p>
<p>The Yarn Market is Rising This Past Week</p>
<p>No Possibility of Genuine Demand Excitement</p>
<p>In the past week, the yarn market continued its upward trend. Due to the recovery of the European and American cotton industries, market prices rose, leading to positive sentiment. In addition, Rongxinghao bought in on dips, and the number of bales accumulated grew larger and larger. Bullish sentiment reached its peak, so there was a high point at the beginning of the week. Later, due to the decline of U.S. cotton, there were many rumors in Shanghai on the 3rd, and sentiment was volatile. General retail investors actively sold off, and the market showed slight weakness. On the weekend, U.S. cotton suddenly rebounded by dozens of pounds, and the bulls dragged in again. However, Changsha help settled 5,000 bales, all of which were absorbed by buyers. However, most people in the business community believe that domestic affairs are chaotic and genuine demand is sluggish, so they are consistently bearish and tend to go short. However, the overseas cotton market shows signs of recovery, and the domestic boycott movement is becoming more heated. Although there are unscrupulous merchants active, the patriotic sentiment in the interior is no less than in Shanghai. Therefore, local cotton yarn stocks are depleted, and inventories are very low. Yarn prices in Wuxi and Changzhou are better, so buyers have an even deeper concept of going long. The future situation is difficult to predict. Genuine demand among guest brokers is still quiet, and there is no excitement from any side, due to the continued difficulty in easing the economy. Statistics show that all brokers only bought 3,858 bales in the entire week, and the market was flat. The total transaction volume of the yarn standard for the week was 167,100 bales. The price of each month fell by 2.1 to 1.9 taels compared to the previous week. The amount of spot yarn purchased by each broker is listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market found new highs at the beginning of the past week. Later, with the fall of U.S. cotton, it turned downstream, but the trend is abnormally tight. It is difficult to reconcile foreign cotton with the silver standard. Japanese merchants sometimes have the idea of ​​purchasing. A certain manufacturer bought a large quantity in October, and another manufacturer sold short in huge quantities. Therefore, both long and short sides are strong. In short, the European and American cotton industries are gradually improving, seeking to restore commercial operations. There is also a lot of bad news about the U.S. cotton harvest, so the situation is quite tight. Speculators tend to buy in, but general retail investors are selling short, given the even distribution of rainfall in the country and a good harvest year. The future depends on the fluctuations of the U.S. and Indian cotton markets. Total Zheng standard cotton transactions for the week was 587,400 dan. The price of each month of the Zheng standard cotton standard fell by 2 qian compared with the previous week. The source on the dock was 2,177 bales of Yao cotton. Spot cotton transactions were higher than before. U.S. cotton fell by 30 pounds compared with the previous week. The amount of spot cotton purchased by each factory is listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Name　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Transaction Volume　Term</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially rose strongly due to good news from Liverpool, but then declined due to Southern sales. Futures rose by 14 to 17 pounds, spot prices rose by 15 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 19 to 21 points, spot prices rose by 28 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 35 points. Indian cotton was sold by Japanese merchants and purchased by brokers.

<p>South Shanghai:　Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from various routes. Due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, retail sales in urban and rural stores became even more sluggish. Moreover, credit is extremely tight, and new goods are flooding in from various places. It is not easy for guest brokers to maintain their selling intentions. The thick japonica rice market fell by 1-2 jiao. Early and late rice followed, falling by nearly 1 jiao. The Ningwei rice is also not improving. In this situation, it is difficult to see the market moving upward. Chen Du Yang tip rice has very little stock and is also following the decline. The transaction volume of Bian Yin Yuan Tao rice is low, and the trend is also weak. Dongxin and Xin Du tip rice's delivery sales are sluggish, falling by 2 chi. There is not much stock of Hetan tip rice, and its demand is also stagnant, following a drop of about 1 jiao.</p>
<p>North Shanghai:　Yesterday, the weather was clear, but the rice market showed no signs of recovery. At the opening this morning, prices of all goods fell. There were still many arrivals from the western routes, and people's sentiment became relaxed. New japonica rice and new guest tip rice each fell by 2-3 jiao. The Changxi and Northern japonica rice and early and late rice markets were lifeless. The arrival of new guest tip rice was limited. Guest brokers had some channels, and the situation was easing. This was actually affected by the situation and financial relations. Foreign firms sold very few foreign rice futures. Also, this month's small squeezed rice is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai next week.</p>

<p>Asphalt:　Each household has already started operating. It is assumed that there should be a batch of sales driven. However, the sluggish business of the paper candle industry is unexpected, causing the autumn sales that retailers were expecting to be less than half of what was expected. This is mainly because the commercial foundation of Shanghai has been greatly affected since the war. Such extravagant items are even more likely to be saved on. This is truly the autumn of "hundred industries withering". It is not just the candle industry. As for asphalt, although there is still some use in soap making, the peak season is in spring and summer. After autumn, orders have already decreased. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, it will be even less significant. Therefore, the candle sales route is entirely relied on in autumn and winter. Now that candle sales have declined, the market is of course depressed. However, stocks in various places are extremely low, so those with goods should not be anxious. Although sales are weak, sellers are still unwilling to lower prices. Moreover, the Hankou market is still strong. This is also due to the lack of goods, which keeps people from being fearful. It is heard that Chong Jing is still at 17.2 taels, Ping Jing at 16.8 qian, and Macheng also requires 17.2-3 taels. The stability of the situation can already be seen. Shanghai retailers have very little stock, so prices, although in line with Hankou, are said to be slightly negotiable.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Tung Oil Trend is Stable <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Tung oil has not been too sluggish due to foreign trade, so although there are occasionally weak trends, it quickly turns around. It can be seen that even if domestic sales are unreliable, foreign trade should continue uninterrupted. Recently, the market has softened slightly because foreign firms in Hankou are not handling many transactions. According to detailed letters from Hankou in recent days, each foreign firm is only handling dozens to at most 100 tons, with prices still at 18.6-7 qian by foreign standards. Although transactions are continuous, there are no large deals, so there is nothing special to report in the market. Domestic sales are preparing for the Mid-Autumn Festival, and those with inventory cannot avoid cautious inspections. The sales market seems quiet. Fortunately, prices have already fallen to the extreme, and there should be no further declines to expect. It is likely that there will be some activity after the holiday.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Hardware and Tin Markets are Rising <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Monday, and the hardware market had more retail sales than wholesale sales. The market situation seemed bustling on the surface, but large-scale transactions were still rare. Because there were no public telegrams from overseas, there were few changes in various markets. However, the tin market suddenly experienced a rapid rise yesterday. Prices for all goods rose by 2-3 taels. According to investigation, the reason for the rise was the increase reported in Singapore private telegrams. In addition, the London tin market is also advancing rapidly, so the Shanghai market followed suit.</p>
<p>New Galvanized Iron Sheet Coming Soon:　Regardless of whether it is No. 24 to No. 28, according to foreign firms, the new galvanized iron sheets are expected to arrive with over a thousand dan this Wednesday or Thursday, so there is no worry about a temporary shortage in the market. The current market price for No. 24 is 9.2 taels per dan, No. 26 is 10.095 taels, and No. 28 is 11.35 taels. It is said that only sporadic transactions have occurred in recent days.</p>
<p>The White Lead Market Has Passed Its Peak:　Since tea brokers stopped operating, the No. 2 white lead market has declined significantly. The No. 3 and 4 military factories have also not made any inquiries, so the market situation is very sluggish. No. 5 and 6 battery factories do a bit of business, which is enough to make do with the remaining situation. There has been no news about No. 7 and 8 for a long time. Although No. 9 and 10 have rebounded slightly, the amount is limited. The overall trend is that the situation is getting worse, and the decline in No. 2 is the most severe. It is currently estimated at 21.25 taels, which is a little over 1 tael less than before.</p>

<p>Minnows:　Turned to Stability</p>
<p>Dried Razor Clams:　According to reports, the harvest of this year's new goods is poor everywhere, so the source is extremely scarce and the market is bullish. The current selling prices are 76 taels for Jian razor clams, 72 taels for small ones, 30 taels for large Jiangbei single-foot razor clams, 75 taels for medium Ningbo razor clams, 45 taels for medium Yantai razor clams, and 36 taels for small ones. Recent retail sales are very brisk, resulting in a situation where the supply cannot meet the demand. In the future, the market prices of various goods are expected to gradually rise.</p>
<p>Minnow Cuttlefish:　The market trend has turned to stability. However, the top-grade Tai Ga is in short supply. When there is business, there is deep concern about not having goods to supply the market. The current prices are 27 taels for Jin Tai, 23 taels for Ti Zhuang, 20 taels for ordinary, and 18-19 taels for lower grades.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Quotations from Ma Xiangbo, a 93-Year-Old Man</p>
<h3 id="e102">Political Parties Use People as Machines <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>On August 3rd, when Elder Xiangbo was seriously ill, I visited him. After pondering for a moment, he told me these words:</p>
<p>"Political parties and politicians, they exploit the people, believing that people are machines that can be driven. Therefore, they try every means to make themselves successful machine operators. Why do I advocate democracy? Because I know that everyone has a conscience. With a conscience, according to natural law, everyone can govern themselves. The people themselves are the masters."</p>
<p>Later, when Mr. Chen came to report on the Northeast issue, Elder Xiangbo gave another example to illustrate the difference between democracy and non-democracy, saying:</p>
<p>"I remember during the Franco-Prussian War, Prussian soldiers invaded French territory in large numbers, and all supplies were raised locally. The local people in France had to provide them. However, they all wrote an invoice at the current price, signed by the Prussian officer, and kept it. Later, when France paid reparations, it deducted these amounts and returned them to the people who suffered losses in the war zone. It seems that the people of that country value the spirit of democracy and put the people first. This has always been the case!"</p>
<p>"I also remember during the Taiping Rebellion, when the Red Turbans came to Shanghai, wealthy Shanghai families, such as the Yu family, were also forced to provide everything. However, afterward, the local officials instead accused them of communicating with the enemy, and as a result, they were all punished. Our country has never protected the people, always guarding against them. Even when the country is in danger and foreign enemies penetrate deep, it is the people who suffer. It seems that if we do not take the path of democracy, there is no fundamental way to save the country from disaster. Are the people of the whole country just going to sit back and watch our compatriots in the Northeast be oppressed?"</p>

<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>丨A Few Lines for Self-Reflection丨</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, when memorial weeks are held in schools, institutions, and organizations, there must be a reading of the "Will" and "three minutes of silence". I think: We should certainly admire and remember Premier Sun Yat-sen’s revolutionary spirit. As the Grand Historian Sima Qian said, "High mountains are admired, and noble conduct is followed. Although we cannot reach them, our hearts aspire to them.” However, reading the will every day may be like a little monk chanting scriptures, with no heart. It really has no value! As for the three minutes of silence, perhaps there are some people who take advantage of this silence to silently think about how they missed hitting the white board yesterday, and the person to their left won a three-card-flush hand. How unlucky! Or, they might silently think: What should I buy to give to my lover when I take my salary home today? In these three minutes, if one had the ability to read minds, one could write a psychological novel of 100,000 words. Now I have a humble opinion that when holding memorial weeks, we can compile a few lines for self-reflection. Everyone can read them aloud once, with their eyes, mouths, and hearts engaged. Perhaps it will have some slight effect. In schools, self-reflection lines can be written on banners and hung in classrooms, like "school mottos," which will have an even better effect. Here are some self-reflection lines (with four examples to illustrate):</p>
<p>Have I forgotten the Japanese occupation of the three northeastern provinces?</p>
<p>Have I forgotten the January 28th Incident?</p>
<p>Have I forgotten the arduous resistance of the volunteers in the Northeast?</p>
<p>Have I ever bought enemy goods?</p>

<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>丨The Prosperous Gambling Den丨</p>
<p>On a certain day of a certain month, thanks to someone's kindness, I got a free ticket to the racetrack, and I had the honor of attending this grand event! It is something that must be recorded, but there's not much to record, so I'll just create a "quick sketch."</p>
<p>Stepping forward, the first thing I encountered was two or three doormen at the front gate. A tall-nosed man pointed with his finger and said, "Go through the side gate." Having never set foot in a racetrack before, I mistakenly walked through two or three iron gates. Along the road, all I saw were densely packed cars. Finally, after stumbling around, I entered the entrance. After walking in, I couldn't help but look back to see if this place was still a "forbidden zone!"</p>
<p>Entering the racetrack and climbing onto the stands, what a huge racetrack it was! Land is more precious than gold in Shanghai, yet they were able to carve out such an open space!</p>
<p>Wherever the signs for the twenty-some horses were displayed, large crowds of people were always gathered. There were gentlemen with protruding bellies, escorting their charming and graceful wives and mistresses. Whether they had blue eyes and tall noses, or flat noses and black hair, in short, they were all regular patrons of this place! At the places where "horse positions" were being bought, all I saw were red and green slips flipping in and out, and silver dollars clanging. Sudden wealth and sudden ruin were all determined by this one gamble!</p>
<p>The race started with twenty-five horses! Those riders in their colorful silk outfits all wanted to be the sole champion! Horses are just beasts, so how would they understand human tricks? They desperately unleashed their four hooves and galloped wildly through the flying dust. As they approached the finish line, two horses collided, and both riders and horses fell to the ground. The horses quickly righted themselves and stood up, but who paid attention to the people rolling on the ground?</p>
<p>Everyone's attention was focused on those fat necks, those protruding chests and bellies, and the binoculars hanging from them, watching to see if number thirty-six had won the race!</p>
<p>Oh, that big champagne, that small champagne, this eternally prosperous gambling den!</p>
<h3 id="e105">Popularization of Art <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Kui</p>
<p>"Popularization of art" is something that everyone has been advocating recently. Indeed, art should be popularized, especially in modern China. The Chinese people of today need a kind of popular, noble, progressive, and mass-oriented art to transform their thinking. However, true mass art has not yet been produced. In this awkward transitional period, what should we use to bridge the gap? Some people advocate infusing new life into the old folk art shells or improving them ideologically to serve as nourishment for the people's spirit. The Tianyi Film Company's recently released "Variety Show Gathering" is a collection of songs, dramas, and variety acts that have been widely circulated among the people, as well as dances that have been introduced from the West. It presents them on the screen as a purely song and dance drama with sound. Besides the original and newly created material, many of the pieces use folk song scores with newly composed lyrics, such as the Taoist song "Fisherman and Woodcutter's Dialogue," the Northern Song "Autumn Chamber Complaint," the Suzhou ballad "Pitying Spring," as well as "Boatman's Song" and "Welcoming Spring Song." There is also a scene of "Su San Being Escorted," which is performed by twelve female stars using new-style song and dance methods to perform Peking opera, which is truly unique. I believe that the production of this film is a comprehensive compilation and organization of folk art. On the one hand, it provides entertainment for the masses, and on the other hand, it provides material for artists to explore. It does achieve some of the effects of "popularization of art" and is indeed a meaningful endeavor.</p>
<h3 id="e106">A Modern View of Buddhism <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Luan Zhen</p>
<p>丨The Bodhisattva is the Original Trendsetter丨</p>
<p>The word "modern" is the most fashionable term in this era. As long as something is related to the present, this word is used to describe it, and it can fully express everything, so no other adjectives are needed. Therefore, everything must be modern now, and if it is not modern, it is not enough to indicate that it is in line with the times.</p>
<p>However, this term is most often applied to women. They themselves strive to be modern, and people often mention modern women. Therefore, in this respect, a new origin has been discovered for the word "modern." If someone were to compile an encyclopedia, I think it would inevitably be included.</p>
<p>This is based on evidence from scriptures and has been verified. At the same time, this source comes from the consideration of those who specialize in studying the truth (?)—the so-called worshipers of Buddha and chanters of sutras. They say, "The Buddhist scriptures once recorded a fact: the Buddha sent the Venerable Ananda to beg for alms and preach the Dharma to save all living beings. He was entangled by demons, and the most dangerous time was when he was seduced by a woman named Matangi, almost causing him to break his vows, because she was a prostitute and the Venerable Ananda went to her as a customer." It is said that he went to save her, but without the Buddha's rescue, even the Venerable could not save himself. So, the "modern" of today comes from this, without a doubt, and the modern women of today are all demons!</p>
<p>"This great discovery should be known to modern men and women," the Bodhisattva would probably say.</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The people of the whole town did not think she was a madwoman and distrust the stories she told, which were exaggerated ravings; because they had already seen the heroic and mighty photo of Regiment Commander Yuan in the newspapers, and had also read many records of the fierce fighting near this town.</p>
<p>The municipal committee summoned the local bullies, gentry, and other relatively wealthy residents and held several meetings, proposing to build a monument in the open space in front of the town's elementary school to commemorate the brave and resourceful Regiment Commander Yuan. This was because they had read a news item in the newspaper stating that this Yuan Renkai, the regiment commander, was from this town. Therefore, Zhu Bofang advocated engraving the four golden characters "Defending the Homeland" on the monument, and he would personally come to participate in the unveiling ceremony when the monument was completed. However, many people opposed the four characters he proposed, especially the older people, who said: The place of origin listed in the newspaper may not be accurate. News reporters often like to exaggerate, just like writing a novel. Because he had made contributions in this town, they said that he was a local. Where did we get a person named Yuan in this town? Therefore, "Defending the Homeland" should not be changed to "Defending the Nation."</p>
<p>At that time, there was an elementary school principal who was of the same faction as the municipal committee. He said: How could there be no one named Yuan living in the town? Isn't Yuan the Madwoman named Yuan? I believe the newspaper's report is correct. Their field reporters are the most accurate and quick in gathering news. How could they be wrong? We have such a hero in our town, and not to praise him would be too much of a loss of our own prestige.</p>
<p>"Haha! So, you also believe that Regiment Commander Yuan is Yuan the Madwoman's husband?" said the owner of a rice shop.</p>
<p>"Yuan the Madwoman is originally a native of this town, but she lived outside since she was a child, and then moved back to the town. Isn't this Regiment Commander Yuan also lived outside since he was a child?" The elementary school principal argued.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion, it was certain that a monument had to be erected, costing approximately three thousand yuan to build. The large characters to be engraved were decided to be "Peace Throughout the Town," firstly to indicate that the merits were for the benefit of this town, secondly to commemorate that the monument was donated by this town, and thirdly that the town could secretly suppress evil and ward off demons. Finally, the chairman of the municipal committee added: "Everyone is here today. We can only treat the words of suppressing evil and warding off demons as private words."</p>
<p>"Don't pass it on to the government, otherwise, being refuted is secondary. Problems will also occur with my position as a member of the municipal committee. Everyone must help a lot!" After saying these words, the meeting was adjourned. Then, Zhu Bofang invited everyone to eat a bowl of noodles, and everyone was very happy, volunteering to donate money to each household, hoping to get as much as possible.</p>

<p>I love spring flowers, I love fine wine, I love the stars of Shanghai, I love the charming smiles of summer nights. In the meantime, I also love reading the rhymes of poets, and like ordinary people, I love gold coins. And even more shocking to myself is that the articles I write have no other meaning than to deceive people.</p>
<p>Looking around at my friends, the honest souls they create in the deep of night with their pens have the same shape and color as mine in the mirror, and then I laugh.</p>
<p>I can no longer believe that there has ever been something in the world that is eternal and indestructible, because I am a human, not a god.</p>

<p>American and Italian Commissioners and Secretaries Arrive on the Same Flight</p>
<p>Left Shanghai This Morning to Return to Europe, Gu Weijun and Others Travel Together</p>
<p>Wang, Song, Luo, and Gu Held a Very Important Meeting Last Night</p>
<p>Lord Lytton, Chairman of the League of Nations Inquiry Commission, American Commissioner Major General McCoy and his wife, Italian Commissioner Count Magazari, along with Secretaries Aster, Coates, and Baird, accompanied by Zhang Xueliang's advisor, Donner, took off from Beiping at 10:15 yesterday morning on a Ford plane and arrived safely at Hongqiao Airport at 3:50 in the afternoon. The newly appointed Ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie, Italian Ambassador Cianno, and others were all at the airport to welcome them. After disembarking, Lord Lytton was unwilling to express any opinions on the content of the report. However, it was learned from another source that the report had just been signed at 8:00 yesterday morning. Lord Lytton and others were then escorted by Mayor Wu and others to the Cathay Hotel. It was decided that they would travel to Europe this morning on the Italian postal ship "Gange."</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Situation Upon Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Hongqiao Airport, which is usually desolate, became very lively yesterday due to the arrival of Lord Lytton and others, and security was also very tight. The head of the Shanghai office of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations had previously notified the authorities of the Public Concession to jointly maintain order. Therefore, Indian police mounted patrols were stationed along Hongqiao Road, and Western and Chinese police were stationed at each intersection. The airport entrance was guarded by police from the Municipal Police Bureau, and sentries were distributed around the airport to strictly prohibit idlers from approaching. The welcoming party consisted of about 80 people, who arrived at the airport陆续 around 1:00 in the afternoon. The airport buildings were all destroyed during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai and have not yet been repaired, so the welcomers were all waiting on the grass. Around 2:00, Ambassador Gu and Mayor Wu also arrived by car and shook hands with the welcomers on the scene. After exchanging pleasantries with Gu and Wu, they walked and talked with Italian Ambassador Cianno. Newspaper reporters took pictures of them. At 3:45, a black dot appeared in the sky to the north of the airport. As it flew closer, the welcomers all craned their necks in anticipation. The huge Ford plane circled the airport twice and then landed safely at the south end of the field. The welcomers all gathered in front of the plane. Italian Commissioner Count Magazari was the first to disembark. Ambassador Gu, Mayor Wu, and Vice Minister Liu all shook hands with him to welcome him. Next were American Commissioner Major General McCoy and his wife, and British Commissioner Lord Lytton was the last to disembark. Lord Lytton wore a white canvas suit, held a cane, and looked radiant, but he was much thinner than when he arrived in Shanghai last time. Lord Lytton shook hands with Mayor Wu and others, his attitude was amiable, his smile was warm, and he repeatedly said that the trip was very pleasant. The reporters rushed to take pictures, and a film company was also on the scene to shoot a sound newsreel, asking Lord Lytton to give a speech. Lord Lytton laughed and said, "I have nothing to say." The Italian representative then continued, "Our words are finished." Everyone smiled brightly. After the photos were taken, they took cars to the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Lytton's Silence <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>After Lord Lytton got off the plane, he shook hands with each of the welcomers and chatted with Gu Weijun, saying that he found the flight very pleasant, especially when he passed Mount Tai, the beautiful scenery caught his eye, like watching a famous painting, which was very fortunate. He then accepted the Fox Film Corporation's request to shoot a sound movie. At that time, the photographer asked Lee to give a simple speech about the investigation team. Lee replied that he had said everything he had to say about the investigation team and would never say another word in the future, and his attitude was unusually silent. Before leaving, Lee specifically returned to the plane, shook hands with the pilot, expressed his gratitude, and was very polite. After arriving at the Cathay Hotel, he did not meet with reporters from various newspapers and declined all social engagements. Therefore, the banquet that Mayor Wu had scheduled at his private residence last night was temporarily canceled.</p>

<p>Last night, a reporter from this newspaper met with Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Wen'gan. He said that he did not meet with Lord Lytton because of the rush of time.

<h3 id="e120">Commemorate the September 18th National Humiliation and Strive to Save the Country Through Aviation <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The China Aviation Construction Association's Circular Telegram</p>
<p>The Standing Directors of the China Aviation Construction Association, Zhu Qinglan, Xiong Xiling, Yin Zhiling, and others, issued a circular telegram saying: To all newspapers, circles, organs, schools, and groups in the country, and to overseas Chinese compatriots, for your review. Since the Japanese bandits invaded and occupied the Northeast, and the Songhu War of Resistance, our national territory has been tainted. Although it is said that the Japanese pirates are rampant and disregard justice, the fact that our military preparations are lacking and our national defense is weak is the reason for inviting insult and disaster. During the Songhu Campaign, our 19th Route Army fought bravely and repeatedly defeated the fierce enemy. However, due to the lack of air defense, our soldiers lost the opportunity to annihilate the enemy. This is what Chief Weng, who defended Wusong, painfully said. It is a great sigh. Now, General Ma Zhanshan is fighting hard in Hailun and is also oppressed by enemy planes everywhere. He lacks the ability to resist, and his soldiers are scattered. Hearing this makes people feel grief and indignation. Comparing the two incidents, it is clear that without air force, there is no way to win, and without air force, defeat is inevitable. If we were to pass the ruins of Zhabei and Wusong, and try to imagine the ashes of the cities in the Northeast, could we not weep bitterly? Since the September 18th Incident, almost a year has passed. The lost territory has not been recovered, and the disaster has deepened. The bombing of Chaoyang has not stopped, and the number of enemy troops in Shanghai has increased again. The arrival of tyranny cannot be reversed. However, the way to save ourselves lies in human effort. Our association is making efforts to overcome the difficulties and strive to be effective. We believe that saving the country requires a strong national defense, and national defense requires a strong air force. The establishment of an air force depends on the joint efforts of our compatriots at home and abroad. Now, on this sorrowful anniversary of the September 18th Incident, there should be a thorough discussion of saving the country and building an air force. We offer four proposals, hoping that you will consider them. (1) Local daily newspapers, magazines, and other publications should focus on promoting aviation to save the country in their materials commemorating the September 18th National Humiliation. (2) All circles, organs, schools, and groups in the country, and overseas Chinese compatriots, should make speeches or performances on aviation to save the country the focus of their commemorative meetings for the September 18th National Humiliation. (3) All circles, organs, schools, and groups in the country, and overseas Chinese compatriots, should save the money spent on entertainment and banquets on September 18th in banks or money shops to be used for aviation construction funds. (4) All circles, organs, schools, and groups in the country, and overseas Chinese compatriots, should strive to build aviation on September 18th to strengthen national defense and relieve national distress. Alas, the national crisis has reached its extreme. The fate of survival hangs by a thread. We are all in the same boat. Can we not be terrified? Now, the people of the country also know how to save the country, and saving the country must involve aviation. The key is to put it into practice. Any of the above four points will be of great help. We hope that all patriotic compatriots will work together to achieve them. If you need to inquire about anything, please send a letter to the China Aviation Construction Association, Continental Shopping Center, Nanjing Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Temporary Martial Law in the City for the Communist International Youth Day Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Gatherings in West Shanghai and North Bund Were Dispersed</p>
<p>Only Reactionary Leaflets Were Seized, Evening Was Peaceful</p>
<p>Yesterday, "September 4th" was the Communist International Youth Day. The authorities of the Chinese Concession received advance notice that the Communists would hold a meeting at that time. In order to maintain local security, they temporarily declared martial law. Gatherings occurred in West Shanghai and North Bund, and were stopped. Many reactionary leaflets were seized in various places. The evening was peaceful. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Martial Law (1) Chinese Concession: The Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, Wen Yingxing, received advance notice that reactionary elements would take the opportunity to riot on September 4th. In order to prevent this, he declared temporary martial law. All police officers of the police stations in South Shanghai, North Shanghai, West Shanghai, East Shanghai, and Pudong were armed and on duty. Double posts were set up on all major roads. Inspectors, detectives, female inspectors, and the police brigade were all on duty patrolling and inspecting pedestrians, especially in North Shanghai and West Shanghai, which were the strictest. The sentry patrol team of the Garrison Command also patrolled around the city. (2) French Concession: All Chinese and Western detectives in the police stations were ordered to be on duty. All iron gates on the border between the Chinese and French Concessions were kept open as usual to facilitate traffic, but armed detectives were stationed at the border crossings, and security was very tight. The iron gates would be temporarily closed if necessary, especially at the West Xinqiao and Xujiahui areas, which were the strictest. (3) Public Concession: All Chinese and Western detectives in the police stations were armed and on duty. The vehicle patrol team set out to patrol. Although yesterday was Sunday, all senior personnel were still on duty as usual, and security was tight, especially in East Shanghai, West Shanghai, and Nanjing Road, which were the strictest.</p>
<p>Dispersing Gatherings At 10:00 yesterday morning, in the jurisdiction of the Fourth District Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau in the West Shanghai and North Bund area, more than 100 people in the form of workers and students suddenly prepared to hold a meeting in an open space. The Tanziwan Police Station of the Fourth District Police Station had already deployed defenses and immediately dispatched armed police to disperse them. Therefore, the meeting did not take place, and only many reactionary leaflets such as "Letter to Workers on the September 4th International Youth Day" were seized.</p>
<p>Seizure of Leaflets After the temporary martial law was declared yesterday by the police stations in various districts of the Municipal Police Bureau, the police stations of the French Concession, and the police stations of the Public Concession, only red and green reactionary leaflets were seized in various places, such as "Letter to All Circles on the International Youth Day," "Workers' Booklets," "To Workers on Japanese Imperialism:::" and other small booklets. All have been filed for reference. The evening was peaceful.</p>

<p>Still Emphasizing Restoring Amity, Coexistence, and Co-prosperity</p>
<p>The newly appointed Japanese Minister to China, Mr. Ariyoshi Akira, and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 3 PM aboard the Nagasaki Maru. The Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Yano, Japanese Consul-General Murai, Japanese legation secretary Ariyoshi, Military Attaché Iwamatsu, Vice-Consul Shirai, and many representatives of the Japanese community gathered at the Waibaidu Bridge Wharf to welcome them. The Japanese military and administrative authorities also dispatched several gendarmes and naval landing forces to be stationed inside and outside the wharf for security. The Shanghai Municipal Police also sent Western and Japanese police to maintain order. After disembarking, Minister Ariyoshi immediately proceeded by car to the official residence on Avenue Pichon. The date for his presentation of credentials in Beijing has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Issuing a Statement  Whenever new Japanese envoys arrive in Shanghai, they always express the idea of Sino-Japanese amity, coexistence, and co-prosperity. Upon his arrival in Shanghai yesterday, Minister Ariyoshi reiterated, "I am determined to transform the current difficult relationship between China and Japan into a restoration of the former state of amity and to establish a foundation for the two countries' coexistence and co-prosperity." However, the method for achieving this hope was not explained by Minister Ariyoshi, as he was in transit yesterday. When inquiring among the general Japanese community, it was said that the so-called restoration of amity excludes Manchuria and Mongolia, and the idea of direct negotiations is even more虚無漂渺 [empty and vague]. Minister Ariyoshi's statement issued yesterday is as follows: "Although I have been appointed as the Minister to China during this difficult period in our two countries' relations, I deeply feel the weight of responsibility. I am now determined to transform this difficult relationship into a restoration of the former state of amity and to establish an Oriental peace based on the keynote of coexistence and co-prosperity between the two countries. I will exert all my efforts to achieve this. I believe that friendly relations between the two countries can only be realized through mutual and full understanding of each other's positions and through both parties working together to adequately meet each other's national needs. Fortunately, I have served in China for many years, and I was able to fulfill my duties and avoid overstepping boundaries on many problems I encountered, based on the aforementioned principles and with the assistance of various sectors of Chinese society. I still take great comfort in this matter. I aspire to base my handling of various issues between the two countries on my past understanding of the Chinese situation, as well as my understanding of the positions of both countries gained from fair observation during my overseas postings. I hope that gentlemen from all sectors of Chinese society, as well as people from all walks of life, will sympathize with my intentions and provide full assistance.

<p>Five Japanese Warships Currently in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, Sakonji, is expected to arrive today from Hankou aboard the flagship Izumo. Of the warships belonging to the First Expeditionary Unit of the Yangtze River, only the flagship Ataka remains docked in Shanghai, along with the cruisers Tenryū and gunboat Toba, which arrived last Friday from Hankou and Jiujiang. The three destroyers of the 24th Division, namely, the Yanagi, Momo, and Tsuta, sailed out of Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Therefore, there are only four vessels in the Huangpu River, including the light cruiser Tokiwa, which is scheduled to return to Japan on the 7th. The rumor that nineteen Japanese warships have been concentrated in the Huangpu River, including a torpedo boat of the 15th Division, is purely unfounded and not to be believed.</p>

<p>Chen Shaofu, director of the National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry, went from Shanghai to Hangzhou on August 31 to collect national products for the exhibition. Upon arrival, he conferred with Mao Zhongfu, director of the Zhejiang Construction Bureau's Hangzhou Municipal Government National Products Exhibition Hall, and other important figures in Hangzhou's national products sector, including Jiang Senyu, Zhou Shiluo, Shi Chunshan, Yang Kechang, and Zhang Zilian, regarding participation in the exhibition. After several discussions, it was decided that all matters related to collecting exhibits would be entrusted to Director Mao. Therefore, Chen returned to Shanghai by train early yesterday (the 4th). However, because many exhibits from various places are still en route, it is difficult to hold the exhibition as scheduled. Therefore, a request has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry to approve the postponement of the opening to September 15, in order to allow for a more relaxed arrangement and ensure completeness. Before the opening, all solicited items are still hoped to be sent to the Shanghai Municipal National Products Exhibition Hall for collection and forwarding. At the same time, the temporary Shanghai office of the hall will be closed on the 7th, and will no longer accept exhibits or gifts.</p>

<p>Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>The Java Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, in order to raise 5 million yuan to establish a large-scale national products company, sent representative Zheng Bulun back to China to investigate the state of national products. Mr. Zheng, through the introduction of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, personally visited various places and, after inspection, realized that there were so many factories in the country and was deeply satisfied. In particular, he received a warm welcome from Mr. Liu Hongsheng, a major industrialist in the area, who specially sent his secretary, Fan Dianxia, to diligently guide him to visit his various factories, such as the Great China Match Company, which can spend huge sums of money on chemical research and improve manufacturing on a daily basis, and the Zhanghua Woolen Mill, which is uniquely capable of weaving high-quality serge woolen cloth. Other factories such as the Shanghai Cement Plant, the Huafeng Enamel Factory, and the China Industrial Factory are all large in scale and have many talented people. Their products can do what others cannot, and are in no way inferior to foreign goods. Mr. Zheng believes that this is enough to make overseas Chinese happy. Mr. Zheng has now gone to Hangzhou and will also go to the North for inspection.</p>

The capital of 5 million yuan was reduced to 3 million yuan, leaving a remaining loss of over 124,000 yuan. If there is a surplus in the 21st year of the Republic [1932], it should be used to offset the losses first. In addition, the various articles of the company's articles of association were also voted on separately and passed. The chairman stated that the number of shareholders attending the meeting today did not exceed half, and according to the law, the resolution to reduce capital and amend the articles of association passed today should be treated as a provisional resolution, and a second provisional meeting of shareholders should be convened on a scheduled date for a vote.

<p>Feng Bingnan's Three Letters of Resignation to Jiao Yitang Expressing His Firm Resolve to Resign as Director of the Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Hall, Recorded as Follows: (1) "To Mr. Yitang, I was negligent in entertaining you when you honored me with your visit the other day. I deeply apologize. When Mr. Zhao arrived here last night, he recounted your intentions in detail, which filled me with inexplicable gratitude and fear. The reason why I have hesitated to accept the position of director of the branch hall of the National Medical Institute is that I am burdened with mundane affairs and have no time to spare. In addition, my health is naturally weak, and even a slight exertion causes me to suffer from insomnia. I have been deeply concerned about the difficulties of the times for years, and I only blame myself for my inadequacy. Moreover, I always take responsibility for everything I do and dare not be perfunctory, which is why I am not liked by others and suffer even more myself. Therefore, I want to gradually withdraw from worldly affairs and care for my mother to the end of her days. I am not using this as a means to make myself seem noble. If, as you say, I can hire someone to take my place, then it would be a mere formality, and I would feel uneasy in my heart. Moreover, if I hire someone to represent me, I would still be legally responsible, so what would be the point? I believe that organizing traditional Chinese medicine is of great importance to our country's cultural undertakings and social well-being. At the beginning, it is necessary to select someone with both virtue and reputation and enthusiasm to promote public opinion and achieve twice the result with half the effort. I am not capable and am busy all day long, so how can I bear this responsibility? I have declined repeatedly because I know myself very well, and I have no choice. I am honored to be known and dare not not express myself fully. Please do not publish this to avoid revealing any trace. I hope that you will cherish yourself. Respectfully, Feng Bingnan, August 29th night." (2) "To Mr. Yitang, I was deeply touched by Mr. Hu Jurand's visit yesterday, conveying your kind intentions. However, my inability to assume the position of director of the branch hall is not out of modesty. I am caught up in mundane affairs and have no time to spare. I am already struggling to cope with my personal business affairs. If I were to take on this position as well, I would not have the energy. If it were merely a formality, I would not be able to live up to your expectations, nor would I be able to live up to the expectations of the medical community, nor would I be able to find peace of mind. After much hesitation, I dare not accept this commission. The importance of this position and the relationship between this matter and the country's culture and social welfare have been fully stated in my previous letter. I admire the perseverance of your leadership, and if I do not hold the position but assist from the side as a member of society, there is no problem. However, if I am given the position of director, I will not accept it under any circumstances. In addition to entrusting Mr. Hu to convey my humble thoughts, I dare to repeat my foolishness out of respect for your understanding. I return the appointment and hope that you will understand. Respectfully, Bingnan, August 31st. Attached is the returned appointment." (3) "To Mr. Yitang, I have missed your teachings for several days. I recently saw a newspaper report about the Shanghai National Medical Institute branch hall, which mentioned that I have been appointed as the director of the main hall. I have repeatedly declined this matter in person and asked that it not be published. I have also entrusted Mr. Hu Jurand and my secretary Mr. Zhao Yongbai to convey everything on my behalf and have sent two letters to you at the end of last month, detailing why I was unable to accept the appointment. However, my request has not been heeded, and it has still been published, which fills me with great fear. In addition to sending separate letters to various newspapers to clarify, I still hope that you will withdraw your order and appoint another capable person. Respectfully, Feng Bingnan, September 4th."</p>

<h3 id="e133">American Chamber of Commerce Opposes International Telegraph Rate Increase <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Former Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, Mr. Lu Guixiang, Expresses His Opinion</p>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai has expressed its opposition to the proposal to increase international telegraph rates between Shanghai and various countries, which will be discussed at the International Telegraph and Wireless Radio Conference in Madrid, Spain, on the 10th of this month. Their reasons are roughly divided into three points: (1) The world economy is in a state of recession, and cannot afford to bear the expense of increased telegraph rates. (2) International telegrams between Shanghai and various countries are already more expensive than those between Europe and America, while the volume of business between Europe and America is better than that between Shanghai and various countries. (3) Due to the depreciation of the Chinese currency, the exchange losses on telegraph fees here are very large, making it difficult to pay increased fees. A reporter from Hua Dong News Agency specifically visited Mr. Lu Guixiang, the former director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, to inquire about his opinion, and he said the following: "The International Telecommunications Conference to be held in Madrid in September of this year is to discuss the merger of the telegraph and radio conventions, as well as the revision of the attached operating rules. The issue of increasing international telegraph rates is not within the scope of the conference's discussion. The claim that the conference will propose increasing telegraph rates between Shanghai and various countries is unfounded. However, at this conference, many participating countries have proposed fundamental revisions to the original international code telegram system, which may affect the price issue. International code telegrams have always been divided into two types, A and B. Type A is limited to ten letters, with three vowels in the middle to facilitate pronunciation. The fee is charged at the full price of a plain language word. Type B is limited to five letters, and the fee is charged at three-quarters of the full price of a plain language word in the European region, and two-thirds in non-European regions. Telegraph authorities and companies in various countries find it difficult to calculate the number of words and charge fees when code words are divided into two types. Moreover, ten letters connected to each other in Type A code words have no meaning and no melody, making them prone to errors. The correction procedures take more time. Countries such as Greece, the Netherlands, and Hungary have similar proposals, advocating that all should be limited to five letters. The Ministry of Transportation of our country also has this proposal, advocating that there should be only one type of code word, with each word consisting of five letters, with at least one vowel. The fee collection method, regardless of whether it is in the European or non-European region, is uniformly charged at three-quarters of the full price of plain language. If this method is adopted, then international code telegrams in non-European regions will increase the fee by one-eighth compared to the old Type B method. This may be the crux of the opposition of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. However, in my opinion, the silver fees collected for code telegrams are actually very cheap compared to plain language telegrams. Although plain language is limited to a maximum of fifteen letters, in reality, few words in various languages are composed of fifteen letters. For example, the long sentence 'It is reported that a proposal for the increasing cable and radil chargesto and from Shanghai will be up for Consideralion at the conference of internatioaltelgrnph union which opens at MADRID ONseptember tenth,' contains thirty-seven plain language words and a total of one hundred and eighty letters, averaging less than five letters per word. If the short intervals in the telegram are deleted without hindering the clarity of the text, the average is always about seven and a half letters. Code words with five letters can possibly express the effect of two plain language words. Therefore, calculated by letters, code words should be one-third cheaper than plain language. Calculated by effect, even if code words are charged twice as much, it would be fine. This time, our country proposes that one code word should be calculated at three-quarters of the full price of plain language, only unifying the fees for non-European and European regions, and there is still no intention to increase the telegram fee. Whether it can pass depends on the opinions of the participating countries, and our country can only obey the majority. As for the American Chamber of Commerce's claim that the international telegraph business between Shanghai and various countries is not as good as that between Europe and America, if it refers to the sending and receiving via submarine cables, then I do not know. If it refers to the international radio station's wireless radio business, then I dare not agree. Checking between Shanghai and San Francisco and between Shanghai and Berlin/Paris, each telegram only takes eight minutes, and at the latest no more than fifteen minutes. During last year's League of Nations General Assembly in Geneva, the wireless radio telegram between Shanghai and Geneva also only took ten minutes. Such business is not much less even compared to Europe and America. As for the global recession and the loss of payment in Chinese currency, these are universal situations and cannot be regarded as reasons. The global recession affects the finances of various countries and various telegraph companies, and China's influence by the preciousness of gold and the cheapness of silver is well known to everyone. Taking the international radio station as an example, the cost of the equipment and materials used are all in gold, and the expenditure in national currency has almost doubled in recent years. How can one only blame the loss of international telegraph fees due to the conversion into national currency?"</p>
<h3 id="e134">Ningbo Native Place Association Seeks to Provide Aftercare for Natives Released in the Amnesty <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Organizing a Committee to Handle the Matter</p>
<p>Since the government promulgated the amnesty ordinance, the Shanghai Local Court and the Special District Court have both complied and handled it one after another, reducing or exempting crimes according to the severity of the crime and the sentence, which is currently in progress. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai is concerned about the livelihood problems of the amnestied prisoners, and Ningbo natives are inevitably among them. Yesterday, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Sun Meitang, Mr. Zhang Jiguang, Mr. Jin Tingsun, and Mr. Mao Heyuan proposed the organization of a committee to be responsible for handling the aftercare of the amnestied natives. On the one hand, they contacted the court and the Municipal Council regarding the natives of Ningbo who have been amnestied, and sent them to the association in batches for inquiries about their personal circumstances, occupations, etc., and dealt with them separately. This righteous act of the association not only gives the prisoners a new path to self-renewal, but also benefits social order. The native place associations in this city are numerous, and after the association's advocacy, there will surely be those who follow suit, which is a good news in the sound of the amnesty.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Verdict of the Second Special Court on the Yun Case <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Yun Huifang, a patriotic person, because Maochang Cotton Fabric Shop, opened by Ningbo native Shen Maochun at 347 Min'guo Road in the French Concession, was privately selling enemy goods and secretly selling them, hindering patriotic unity. After warnings by letter proved ineffective, on the 5th of last month at 9:00 PM, he carried a hand grenade to the shop and threw it as a warning, destroying the glass floor. At that time, Yun fled into the Chinese territory and was intercepted by a patrol officer and taken to the bureau. Subsequently, the political department of the French Concession police sent detectives to the Public Security Bureau to bring Yun back to the police station for investigation and escort him to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After Judge Wang Gangxu of the Criminal Court held a trial, with the defendant represented by a lawyer, a verdict was reached. Yun Huifang was sentenced to two months of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve. These details have been published in various newspapers. However, Yun is also related to a bombing case at a certain coal shop on Xinza Road in the Public Concession. The Public Concession police have brought him to the First Special District Court for questioning. Because legal points of contention have not been resolved, the formal trial has not yet begun. The full text of the Second Special Court's verdict is recorded below for the perusal of interested parties.</p>
<p>Criminal Verdict of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, No. 264, 21st Year Xie Di Zi, verdict against the defendant Yun Huifang, male, 16 years old, native of Changzhou, occupation typesetter at a printing bureau, residing at 207 Mei'an Lane, Park Road, retained defense lawyers Zhao Chen, Shen Junru, and Liu Hongxun. The above-listed defendant was prosecuted by the police department for offenses such as obstruction of freedom and damage. The court's trial verdict is as follows: (Main Text) Yun Huifang is sentenced to two months of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve for the crime of threatening others with harm to life and property, causing a danger to safety. A package of hand grenade fragments is confiscated. (Facts) Yun Huifang learned that Maochang Foreign Goods Shop at 347 Min'guo Road was selling Japanese goods. On August 5th of this year, at approximately 9:00 PM, seeing that there was no one in the shop, he threw a hand grenade into it as a warning. Unexpectedly, the hand grenade exploded immediately, causing damage to the glass floor and other items. Yun Huifang fled not far before being apprehended by Chinese patrol officers and taken to the bureau. Subsequently, he was taken back by the French Concession police for investigation, along with the hand grenade fragments, and prosecuted in court under Articles 158, 161, and 382 of the Criminal Code. (Reasons) In this case, the defendant Yun Huifang has confessed to throwing a hand grenade at Maochang Foreign Goods Shop, and he was apprehended on the spot by Chinese police. The facts are extremely clear. However, according to the defendant's testimony, throwing the hand grenade was only a warning not to sell Japanese goods, and there was no intention to harm anyone. Because there were many people during the day, he was afraid of hurting someone, so he threw the grenade at night when the shop employees were outside enjoying the cool air. Upon investigation, the defendant threw the grenade at Maochang Foreign Goods Shop with the intention of intimidating the shop owner. The resulting harm was only to the safety of the shop. This does not fall under the circumstances stipulated in Article 158 of the Criminal Code. The defendant should be found guilty of violating Article 319 of the same law. As for being involved in the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group," according to the defendant's testimony, the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group" only consisted of himself and a Mr. Cai. There was no so-called organization, nor any articles of association. He himself created the name, and the purpose was only to warn treacherous merchants. Since the defendant claims that the so-called "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group" only had two members, it is difficult to consider it an association with the purpose of committing crimes. He cannot be convicted under Article 161 of the Criminal Code. There is no doubt about this. Regarding the damage portion, Shen Maochun of Maochang Foreign Goods Shop reported it to the police department in writing, specifying that five pieces of glass and one strip of flooring were damaged. This should be considered a legitimate accusation and accepted. However, the damage to the glass floor was the result of committing another crime. According to Article 74 of the Criminal Code, compared to Article 382 of the same law, the heavier penalty under Article 319 should be applied. The defendant Yun Huifang was born on the 16th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar in the sixth year of the Republic. Counting to August of this year, he has not yet reached the age of sixteen. The original sentence should be reduced by one-half. Furthermore, the defendant's criminal act was motivated by righteous indignation and is excusable. The original sentence should be further reduced by one-half. Moreover, the defendant has not been sentenced to detention or a more severe punishment. This meets the conditions for a reprieve. A reprieve should be granted. The seized hand grenade fragments are contraband and should be confiscated.

<p>Japanese Shell Buried in Soil</p>
<p>Detonates Upon Contact, Flesh and Blood Fly</p>
<p>Many sections of the seawall around the Shizilin Fort in Wusong were damaged by Japanese artillery fire. With the autumn tide approaching, the situation is precarious. Wan Kaijia, director of the Baoshan Seawall Works, has been hiring workers to rush repairs in recent days. Yesterday morning, around 11:30 AM, three laborers, Bian Guifang, Jiang Wanyu, and Zhou Zhiming, were working on the seawall at the northern end of Shizilin, using rakes to dig up soil. Unbeknownst to them, an unexploded Japanese shell was buried in the soil. They did not notice it during their work. Upon contact, it immediately exploded. The three workers were torn apart, and all died instantly. After the incident, it was immediately reported to the Baoshan County government. County Magistrate Sun dispatched investigation officer He Cheng to the scene. It was determined that the deceased, Bian Guifang, Jiang Wanyu, and Zhou Zhiming, all had ruptured abdomens and flowing intestines, and their limbs were incomplete. The scene was ghastly. It was confirmed that they had been killed by the explosion. The foreman was ordered to collect the bodies.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Water Boiler Explosion at Mei Xin Dye Factory Injures People <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Three Dye Workers Scalded by Boiling Water</p>
<p>Two Sections of Chimney Soar into the Sky</p>
<p>Nearby Electric Lights Extinguished</p>
<p>Mei Xin Silk Fabric and Electric Dye Factory, located at 64 Guling Road, has been in operation for three years. It was founded by Dai Jinyu, a native of Shaoxing, and the business is doing well. Yesterday evening, around 9:50 PM, the dye factory workers were still working late because of a large backlog of goods. Unexpectedly, the water boiler in the rear building, due to excessive heat, had a pressure relief pipe malfunction, causing it to explode suddenly with a sound like a cannon. Neighbors were awakened from their dreams. Boiling water from the boiler splashed everywhere like waves, causing severe burns to dye workers Yu Jinfang, Zhou Jinshui, and Wang Arong, who were nearby. They immediately fainted and fell to the ground. At the same time, two sections of the iron chimney on the roof of the furnace room were blown into the sky. One section landed on the roof of house number 109 in Dehua Lane behind the factory, collapsing one stove awning. Another section flew towards Park Road, severing electric wires at the intersection of Park Road and Guling Road. It then fell on the roof of Jusheng Rice Shop at 678 Park Road, piercing the roof. As a result, the electric lights along the road in various lanes were completely extinguished. Hua Pu, officer number 3914, on guard duty at the scene, immediately blocked traffic to prevent electrocution. He reported to the police station, which dispatched officers to investigate and provide assistance. The electric company was notified to send technicians to repair the damage as quickly as possible. The electricity was restored that evening. The three dye workers who were scalded by boiling water were transported by Hua Pu's car to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, their injuries are critical, and their lives may be in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Fire Aboard the Xinning Shao Steamer in the Cargo Hold Extinguished <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Passengers Were Startled, but Fortunately All Are Safe</p>
<p>Streetcar and Ambulance Collide, Injuring People</p>
<p>The Xinning Shao steamer of the Ningshao Steamship Company, which travels between Shanghai and Ningbo, encountered a fire in the cargo hold on its return trip from Ningbo. Fortunately, the fire was discovered not far from Shanghai. The crew responded effectively, preventing the fire from spreading. Although the cargo suffered losses and the passengers were startled, it was a stroke of good fortune amidst misfortune. However, as a result of this incident, a collision between an ambulance and a streetcar caused a disaster in which many firefighters were injured. The details are described below.</p>
<p>Fire Breaks Out in the After Hold: The Xinning Shao steamer departed from Ningbo for Shanghai on the afternoon of the 3rd, carrying a shipment of cotton, which was divided into the middle and after holds. The hold was normal when the ship left Ningbo. Around 2:00 AM that night, smoke suddenly appeared in the cargo in the after hold. The crew discovered the smoke and reported it to the captain, first mate, and second mate. Under the captain's orders, the hatch was quickly sealed, and the after hold was isolated from the middle hold to prevent the fire from spreading. The fire extinguishers on board were used to pump extinguishing agents into the hold, and the ship sped towards the port. The first mate sent a telegram requesting assistance.</p>
<p>Ship Arrives in Shanghai: The Wusong Radio Station received the telegram about the ship's fire and forwarded it to the company. The company reported to the customs and notified the Nanshi Fire Brigade to have fire trucks waiting at the Ningshao Wharf for the ship's arrival. However, after the hold was sealed and extinguishing agents were injected, the fire gradually died down. The ship entered Wusong at 6:40 AM, and when it arrived at the wharf at 8:00 AM, the hold was no longer smoking. After the ship docked, the passengers disembarked first, and then the hatch was opened to spray water.</p>
<p>Minimal Cargo Damage: When the hatch was opened, the hot, humid air inside rushed out. Four firefighters on board were suffocated and collapsed on the ship. They were rescued and brought ashore by fellow firefighters. The Public Concession was telegraphed to send ambulances to transport the injured. The fire trucks then sprayed water into the after hold. The fire was extinguished quickly. Upon inspection, only two bales of cotton were burned, causing minimal damage. The other goods, which were not burned, suffered significant water damage and are currently being unloaded and inspected.</p>
<p>Car Collision Causes Accident: An ambulance, numbers 2 and 3, from the Public Concession was heading to Nanshi when it approached the Grand Clock Tower in the French Concession. There, it encountered streetcar number 10, which was speeding west from the Bund. The ambulance was traveling south to north. The two vehicles approached each other, and both attempted to yield. However, while the drivers were hesitating to move forward or backward, the ambulance had already entered the streetcar tracks and was violently struck in the side. The ambulance body was immediately damaged, and all the glass was destroyed. The driver of the ambulance, Wang Wenyu, and firefighter personnel, including a Mr. Ying and a Mr. Zhang, were injured in the head. Two other people, a Mr. Zhang and a Mr. Liu, were injured in their hands. One passenger in the streetcar was injured in the face. The Red Cross arrived, and the injured were transported to the hospital. The damaged vehicles were towed away.</p>

<p>Implementing Agencies Changed to Offices Attached to Consulates</p>
<p>Consular certification of cargo manifests was implemented on the first of this month. The original plan was for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send personnel to various treaty ports in foreign countries to handle the matter. Yesterday, the Central News Agency quoted Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie as saying that due to financial constraints at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the implementation would be handled by offices attached to Chinese consulates in various countries. Special personnel would no longer be dispatched separately.</p>

<p>The various mosques in Shanghai previously held scripture readings and prayers for Ma Fuxiang on the 26th of this month. Yesterday (September 4th), they held a memorial meeting at the Islamic Association. The Chinese Islamic Association, the Shanghai Qingzhen Board of Directors, the Qingzhen West Mosque, South Mosque, and North Mosque within Shanghai city, the Qingzhen Foreign Mosque outside the city, and various Qingzhen mosques, as well as the Shanghai Islamic Classics Institute, Shanghai Dunhua Elementary School, Islamic Orphanage, and Muslim community members all attended the memorial service at the association. The meeting began at 10:00 AM, and the rituals were performed. Mr. Ha Shaofu was elected as chairman, and he reported on the purpose of the meeting and the achievements of Mr. Ma, followed by Elder Ha Decheng reading an elegy (in Arabic). Elder Da Pusheng gave a vernacular Chinese translation, and Mr. Jin Xusheng translated it into classical Chinese. They also read memorial essays from various organizations, all praising Mr. Ma for promoting and assisting Islamic studies, publishing Islamic books, and intending to translate Islamic classics. Next, Mr. Ma Jundong gave a speech, stating that Muslims must continue Mr. Ma's aspirations, revitalize their spirits, develop Islam, and strive to save people and assist the country through religion. After the speech, Elder Zhou of the Xieqiao Qingzhen Mosque lectured on the Way of Heaven, and then the meeting adjourned. It was already 1:00 PM. All memorial essays and elegies, along with the Arabic translation into Chinese, are attached below to demonstrate the Muslim community's unwavering remembrance of Mr. Ma.</p>
<p>Memorial Essays from Various Organizations: The Chinese Islamic Association, the Shanghai Qingzhen Board of Directors, the Shanghai Qingzhen West Mosque, South Mosque, North Mosque, various Qingzhen mosques in Shanghai city and the Foreign Mosque outside the city, the Shanghai Islamic Classics Research Society, Shanghai Dunhua Elementary School, Shanghai Islamic Orphanage, and the entire Muslim community of Shanghai, for the memorial essay for Mr. Ma Yunting, member of the Central Executive Committee and member of the National Government: Alas, Mr. Ma has returned to the Lord's command. The various Qingzhen mosques in Shanghai, after the Zhu Mu'er gathering on August 26th, reverently recited the scriptures and prayed for Mr. Ma. They also held a general assembly on September 4th to commemorate Mr. Ma. The essay states: The mountains are towering, the merits of Mr. Ma are lasting; the waters are vast, the virtues of Mr. Ma are enduring. Mr. Ma came to Shanghai, revitalizing the Muslim faith, and its prosperity was magnificent, dispelling all darkness. The palaces and halls were bright and clear. Mr. Ma visited and promoted them. The Qingzhen mosques benefited from his support. Practicing etiquette and encouraging virtue, the high halls are bright and radiant. The association is benevolent and charitable, and the spirit of the Way is widespread. It is Islam, and its difficulties and hardships are great. Monthly provisions are provided, and scriptures are transmitted. The orphaned children are dependent on education and care. Fifty acres of land, the merits are immense. For the faith, Mr. Ma instructed with words; for learning, he supported with strength. Pure and sincere, refined and focused, he communicated with the Supreme Sovereign above and bestowed blessings below. Thinking of Mr. Ma, we cannot forget him; feeling his passing, we are deeply saddened. The Great Wall is lost, and our path is uncertain. The memorial essay is inadequate, and we silently mourn. We pray that Mr. Ma will be released and ascend to the Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
<p>Arabic Elegy Translated into Chinese: The elegy of the Shanghai Islamic Classics Research Society for Mr. Ma Yunting, member of the National Government (a careful translation of the Arabic main points): I begin in the name of the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful Lord. Do you know, that everything besides the True Lord is false? O True Lord, eternally unchanging, guiding fate and nurturing the spirits of the three realms. The Lord descended the Prophet Muhammad, bestowing mercy and peace. All people return to the Lord, carrying on the scriptures. Praising the Holy Lord, truly understanding the profound principles. This wise man competed to practice the Way. Suddenly he is gone, oh how sad! Tears flow. Vague and indistinct, the cornerstone of the nation, the magnificent Mr. Ma, the epitome of man. We pray that the Lord will bestow grace, benevolence, courage, righteousness, enlightening the Way and upholding justice, steadfastly protecting the faith, bestowing blessings and kindness, the Lord bestows beautiful virtues, gathered in one person, fully prepared, who can compare? Ah, Mr. Ma, receiving his mandate purely and clearly, bringing peace and prosperity to the Muslim community, and promoting the Classics. The Chen Da in the north, the Yilan in the south, the school buildings are towering, and the benevolence is deep and vast. The fields of Wuyuan, thirty acres, the foundation of Yilan, existing eternally. Loyalty and faith, sincere reverence, teaching Islam, issuing clear instructions. Willing to build and establish, his wise sons will flourish, assisting our Yilan, with constant expenses every year. Splendid and illustrious, the Classics are outstanding. Mr. Ma's learning enlightens future generations. With the aspiration to translate, benefiting this China, with great ambitions and steadfast strength, hoping to achieve it quickly, passing it on endlessly. Alas, Mr. Ma, his beautiful virtues are revealed, a model and standard, his merits please the Lord. We belong to the True Lord, and we will eventually return to the True Lord. Reciting the scriptures to pray to the True Lord, bestowing beauty, patience, and granting grace to his family, carrying on the legacy of his predecessors, their talents are brilliant. We pray that the Lord will bestow His gifts, flowing universally and widely benefiting. Stop our sorrow, cease our tears, the Lord's grace, Mr. Ma is rewarded, the Lord's reward, Mr. Ma's virtues are excellent, residing in paradise, eternally joyful. The elegy says: Alas, Mr. Ma, radiant and shining, we who are left behind cannot compare. Enlightenment and guidance, who will continue? Assisting the world and supporting the faith, who will carry it on? Virtue and goodness, benevolence and charity, who can continue? Endlessly sad thoughts. May 2nd, 1351 of the Muslim calendar, September 4th, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e141">All Workers at the Hu'nan Public Bus Company Left the Factory Yesterday <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Settlement of Reinstatement Issue Awaits Legal Mediation</p>
<p>Since the Hu'nan Public Bus Company on Xie Xu Road announced its closure, both sides have repeatedly argued over the issues of back pay and the return of uniforms, nearly forming a serious labor strike. Fortunately, with the proper handling by the party and government authorities, the situation has calmed down. The workers received their back pay yesterday and all left the factory. They also held a general meeting to elect nine representatives to negotiate with the company on their behalf. The other demands are listed below.</p>
<p>Workers Leave the Factory: After the company issued back pay to all workers at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 1st), they inquired about how the party and government representatives would handle their demands for reinstatement. Party representative Fan Guoren and Social Affairs Bureau representative Peng Zhenqiu replied explicitly that the party and government authorities would mediate the demands according to law in the near future. Therefore, all workers complied with the third preliminary measure (i.e., the workers would leave the factory on the day the company paid all back wages), and all workers completely left the factory at 9:00 PM that evening.</p>
<p>Meeting Arrangements: After leaving the factory, all workers convened a general meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Meijia Alley District Party Headquarters to discuss negotiating their demands for reinstatement with the company. At the meeting, Hu Jinshan, Yin Changgen, Tao Baoyu, Yan Anshan, Qian Shunhao, Qiao Jihe, Shang Liansheng, Gu Alin, Wu Junhui, and others were elected as representatives with full power to negotiate. A reconnaissance team was also organized to monitor the company's movements at all times.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Labor Dispute at Xu Chongdao Heard Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Workers Express Refusal to Return to Work</p>
<p>To Hold General Meeting to Discuss Response</p>
<p>Since the employees of all branches of the Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store announced a strike, the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday instructed both labor and management to resume work by 5:00 PM today. However, the labor side indicated that it would be difficult to accept and would convene a general membership meeting to discuss providing assistance to the labor dispute. There is a significant possibility of expansion. The details are listed below.</p>
<p>Refusal to Return to Work: After the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order instructing employees to resume work by 5:00 PM on the 5th, the strike committee immediately convened a meeting of all employees. It was believed that the Social Affairs Bureau's order disregarded the workers' plight and was practically impossible to comply with. Moreover, the company claimed that Qu Zhibao's arrest was by order of the general manager, implying that the general manager intentionally framed him, and the facts are clear.</p>
<p>Store Appeals: The Xu Chongdao store appealed to the employees yesterday: "The company deeply regrets that the employees have launched a strike without following legal procedures. The Social Affairs Bureau has now ordered all employees to resume work by 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th and will deduct wages for the strike period as a slight punishment. It is hoped that all employees will consider the mutual interests of both sides, comply with the order to resume work to maintain the store's business and the lives of patients and social stability, and avoid being exploited and making further mistakes.</p>
<p>Discussion of Assistance: According to reliable information from the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, the union is actively preparing methods of assistance and has scheduled a general membership meeting for the afternoon of the 8th to discuss countermeasures. The main points heard at yesterday's strike committee meeting of the store's workers were to warn Xu Dakun and Xie Hongxun, two workers, to leave the store immediately and act together, otherwise, they would be reported to the higher authorities and expelled from membership, and attempts would be made to expel them. A small number of students are still working, and they have also been warned by letter to leave the store immediately, otherwise, they will be deprived of all rights. In response to the orders from above, they will state their reasons based on the facts and request the revocation of the order. If there are no appropriate conditions, they will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and vow not to return to work.</p>
<p>Union Preparations: Since the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association received the Xu Chongdao store's report to the Social Affairs Bureau on the handling measures, it immediately advised the store to remain calm and promote the employees' automatic awareness and return to work. However, it is still feared that the employees may be threatened by a small number of unscrupulous elements and prevented from returning to work. The association has already consulted with the store to carefully plan the necessary measures to deal with this situation. The general outline has been decided, but it is said that the measures must be submitted to the party and government authorities for approval before they can be announced.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Labor Side Requests Strict Enforcement After Ruling in the Three Friends Case <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Memorial to Mayor Wu Yesterday</p>
<p>The labor dispute between the Three Friends Industrial Society, which has been delayed for a long time, was formally adjudicated by the arbitration committee convened by the municipal government on the 31st of last month. The arbitration ruling was delivered to both parties on the 2nd of this month. The Cotton Textile Industry Union of the 7th District published a statement to all sectors in the newspapers, expressing its painful acceptance. On the afternoon of the 4th, representatives Xia Zhongzhao and Qin Haiyan were sent to the society's distribution office on Nanjing Road to negotiate. General Manager Shen Jiucheng met with them and stated that the arbitration case was unacceptable and that he would file an objection. The labor side believes that the company is so persistent and unreasonable. Yesterday, they submitted a special document to the municipal government requesting strict enforcement as soon as possible to avoid prolonged suspension and social unrest. The original text is recorded below. A report stating that the labor dispute has been adjudicated and requesting strict enforcement as soon as possible to avoid prolonged suspension and social unrest. Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the company of the Three Friends Industrial Society has taken the opportunity to temporarily suspend work at the Shanghai General Factory, delaying it until August. The workers have been displaced and suffered greatly. We have repeatedly asked you to order the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate, but the company has remained rigid and uncompromising. The workers have repeatedly appealed, their voices hoarse and exhausted. Considering this, their livelihoods have been cut off. Hong Jiaben and others have successively gone on hunger strike, forced to this situation. The Central People's Movement Committee and the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, in view of this situation, have telegraphed you one after another, using extraordinary means, etc. On the 31st of last month, you convened an arbitration committee to handle this labor dispute, with four adjudication methods. The adjudication document has been delivered to both parties. To maintain the dignity of national laws and the credibility of the government, the affiliated union reported on the 3rd of this month in a statement to all sectors that it would sincerely comply. On the afternoon of the 4th, representatives Xia Zhongzhao and Qin Haiyan were sent to the company headquarters to negotiate with the authorities. Unexpectedly, the company refused to accept the adjudication. As the autumn wind brings coolness and the days become colder, the workers lack the lined clothes and bedding they need. In the recent climate, it is already impossible to sustain themselves, and soon the snow and ice will freeze them to death. We have prepared a special document to request you to strictly enforce the adjudication as soon as possible so that the long-delayed labor dispute can be resolved early and the lives of the workers can be revived. In urgent presentation, we cannot express our anxiety as we await your orders. Respectfully submitted to Wu, the mayor of Shanghai, by the Shanghai 7th District Cotton Textile Workers' Union.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Sugar Industry Association Again Writes to Customs Superintendent Regarding Unfair Public Auction, Requesting Justice <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, based on a letter from its member Guangyuan, states that George, the Customs Commissioner of the General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs, engaged in questionable practices during the public auction of confiscated white sugar. It details the irregularities and again requests the Customs Superintendent to uphold justice and provide a fair resolution. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>"Having received your letter of the 13th of this month, regarding the requested thorough investigation of the public auction of confiscated white sugar, the Customs Commissioner replied that the Yuanji firm's bid was altered before it was opened and that the auction was not conducted publicly. He claims that the opening and decision were handled by the Customs Commissioner of the General Affairs Department, who considers Guangyuan firm to be unfamiliar with customs regulations and therefore should not rashly accuse them of shady dealings. He requests that you express your apology to the Customs, and until this is done, all matters related to your firm's dealings with the Customs will be ignored. We were asked to investigate and report back.</p>
<p>Having informed Guangyuan of this, we received a reply stating that the Customs Commissioner admits that the auction of the confiscated sugar was not public and that the bid was indeed altered. However, he defends the lack of public opening by claiming it is the usual practice of the Jianghai Customs. We question whether there is any explicit provision in the customs regulations for this. Even if such a regulation exists, it is questionable whether it aligns with the spirit of a public auction. Furthermore, regarding the alteration of the bid before it was opened, we request that sufficient evidence be provided. If this were true, then all bids submitted to the Customs could be altered before being opened, which is unreasonable.</p>
<p>There are two points that raise doubts about whether the bid was altered before it was opened: (1) Yuanji's original bid was four taels and four mace, but suddenly became five taels and one mace; (2) The price of five taels and one mace was precisely three fen higher than our bid. Considering this, we must request that your association continue to petition the Customs Superintendent to review and avoid being deceived by clever disguises.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in our letter of the 4th of this month, we requested that the Customs Superintendent conduct a thorough investigation. We were not concerned about our losing the bid, but we feared that if the Customs' public auction of confiscated goods lacked fairness and protection, it would deter legitimate bidders and allow cunning individuals to take advantage, ultimately resulting in a loss of national revenue. Therefore, our request for rectification is in the public interest, not for personal gain. However, the Customs Commissioner demands that we apologize and threatens to ignore all our future dealings with the Customs. This abuse of power is evident, and we request that your association again petition the Customs Superintendent to uphold justice."</p>
<p>Based on the above, the association believes that the original intention of the investigation is to prioritize the national treasury, not to recover a lost bid, and that the alteration of the bid raises concerns. Conducting an auction without public opening is not conducive to preventing corruption. Therefore, we again request that you, the Superintendent, provide a fair resolution. We also hope that you will appropriately correct the Customs Commissioner's abuse of power to uphold justice and benefit the national treasury. We earnestly hope for this outcome.</p>

<p>Commending His Good Medicine for Saving People</p>
<p>General Zhu Qinglan, since retiring from politics, has dedicated himself to charitable work, personally going to various regions to rescue disaster victims for over a decade. He has saved countless lives and is praised far and wide. With the fall of the Northeast and the looming war, thirty million compatriots are suffering under the enemy's iron heel, a truly tragic situation. Based on his enthusiasm for disaster relief as a form of national salvation, Zhu departed for the Northeast the day before yesterday to carry out relief work. Before his departure, he presented a written piece to Hu Wenhu, owner of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, recognizing his consistent dedication to disaster relief and national salvation, which aligns with his own principles. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Mr. Hu Wenhu, an overseas Chinese compatriot from Southeast Asia, has always been charitable and particularly passionate about domestic affairs. He spares no effort in providing disaster relief. His Yong An Tang has invented four medicines—Wan Jin You, Ba Gua Dan, Headache Powder, and Qing Kuai Shui—which are effective, affordable, and provide quick relief, greatly benefiting the people. In the past, when I was providing disaster relief in Shaanxi, Mr. Hu donated a large amount of medicine, saving countless lives. I admire his kindness and commend his good medicine. I record these words to introduce him to society. August, the Twenty-First Year of the Republic of China, Zhu Qinglan."</p>

<p>Wang Yiming Is Tempted</p>
<p>Wang Hanqing and Wife Are Beaten</p>
<p>In a tailoring workshop owned by Chen Zhangshi, a member of the Red Gang, located at number eight or nine of Huaji Road, Hongkou, there was an apprentice named Wang Yiming, fourteen years old, who worked diligently. A gangster nicknamed "One-Armed Tyrant" Ge Zongshi (because Ge is disabled) frequently appeared at the door of the tailoring shop, enticing the apprentice and sowing discord. Wang Yiming was tempted and followed Ge to a small inn in Xinkang Lane in the French Concession. Chen Zhangshi, after discovering that the apprentice was missing, searched everywhere without success. Wang's sister lived at number nineteen in Yanqing Lane in the city. Ge Zongshi went to Wang's sister's house to inform her, where he encountered her husband, Wang Hanqing. Ge told him, "Your brother-in-law Wang Yiming is staying at a small inn in the French Concession and needs money for food." Wang Hanqing agreed to provide the money, but only if he could go to the small inn with Ge and bring his brother-in-law back. Ge refused and wanted Wang Hanqing to first go to a teahouse for a negotiation. Wang's wife asked Ge, "Are you kidnapping and demanding a ransom?" This led to a quarrel. Unexpectedly, ten of Ge's accomplices, who were waiting outside the door, rushed in and beat Wang and his wife without asking any questions. They also injured the tenants, Mr. and Mrs. Nie Dongchen. Fortunately, patrol officer Xu Rong heard the commotion and arrived to control the situation, stopping them at the door. Wang Hanqing escaped and reported the incident to the First Precinct of the Second District, which dispatched a large number of police officers to make arrests. However, the suspects had already fled in all directions, except for Ge Zongshi, who was apprehended and taken to the station for questioning. Xu, the precinct chief, learned that Wang Yiming was still at the inn and sent police to retrieve him, but he had been taken away. The case involves kidnapping and ransom and has been handed over to the General Bureau for handling.</p>

<p>Application of Article 45 of the Factory Law</p>
<p>Wu Genyun, a mechanic in the weaving room of Shen Xin No. 6 Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, had his right arm severed by a machine belt during work. Although the wound healed, the arm could not be reattached, resulting in permanent disability. Wu argued that his injury was solely due to the prolonged use and failure to replace the machine belt, and that the factory was undeniably responsible. He hired lawyers Yang Linzhi and Ye Shaoying to file a lawsuit against the factory, seeking 3,000 yuan in compensation and 1,900 yuan in disability benefits under the government-promulgated Factory Law. After several court hearings in the First Special District Court, the court concluded that Article 45, Paragraph 1, Section 2 of the Factory Law was applicable and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff 1,000 yuan in benefits as compensation. The claim for compensation for losses was rejected. However, the factory, in its defense, stated that although the Factory Law had been implemented, factories had not actually complied with it. Now that the court has made the above ruling, workers who are injured on the job can legally demand compensation from the factory based on this law. The court's reasoning is transcribed below:</p>
<p>"Since the plaintiff worked as a car repairman in the defendant's factory, matters related to factory repairs are within his job description. The defendant cannot be held responsible simply because of different supervisors. The claim that the belts in the defendant's factory were not replaced after prolonged use is unsubstantiated. Furthermore, witnesses Zhu Weizhang and Tan Xifan testified that the plaintiff was injured because he was careless when handling the belt, not because the belt was defective. It is evident that the plaintiff's injury was not the fault of the defendant, and therefore his claim for compensation for losses is without merit. However, since the plaintiff's right arm was completely severed, resulting in permanent disability, his request for benefits is justified. The plaintiff claims that his daily wage was 85 cents, plus a monthly double wage of 12 yuan and annual bonuses, which, calculated over three years, would amount to 1,900 yuan. However, Article 45, Paragraph 1, Section 2 of the Factory Law states that disability benefits cannot exceed the average wage for more than three years. The plaintiff's daily wage and monthly double wage in the defendant's factory were only over 30 yuan, and annual bonuses are not considered wages and cannot be included in the calculation. Therefore, based on the scope defined by the Factory Law, this court orders the defendant to pay the plaintiff 1,000 yuan in benefits as compensation, and the plaintiff's remaining claims are dismissed. This ruling is made in accordance with Article 82 of the Civil Procedure Law, as stated in the main text."</p>

<p>A Passerby Is Wounded by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>At approximately 1:00 AM this morning, a robber armed with a gun robbed a business near Yunnan Road. The victim alerted the police, and the robber fled towards the intersection of Yunnan Road and Avenue Edward VII. The Chinese constable on duty there blew his whistle to notify three other Chinese constables nearby to help with the pursuit. As the robber fled to the vicinity of the Da Zhong Lou restaurant on Avenue Edward VII, he turned and fired at the pursuing Chinese constables. The four Chinese constables returned fire, but neither side was hit. The robber crossed Avenue Edward VII and fled towards Zilaihu Street in the French Concession. However, a passerby, Wang Jintang, was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet and was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The four Chinese constables returned to the police station to report the incident.</p>

<p>Unable to Repay 30 Yuan</p>
<p>Taking Her Life as a Final Gamble</p>
<p>Wang Zhu, a 25-year-old woman from Taizhou, lived at number 76 Dongjiaxing Road. Her husband, Wang Rongqing, was a rickshaw puller, and she managed the rickshaw fares and accounts. However, she was addicted to gambling. On the 24th of last month, she took 30 yuan from the accounts to use as gambling money, but lost it all. When her husband discovered the 30 yuan missing from the accounts, he questioned his wife. She claimed that her mother's family had borrowed it and promised to return it at the beginning of this month. When the deadline arrived the day before yesterday, she was unable to repay the debt and swallowed opium in despair. Her husband discovered her and immediately took her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died. The hospital reported the incident to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which sent investigators. The body was taken to the Fielun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue, confirmed the body, and took a statement from the deceased's husband, Wang Rongqing, who recounted the events. Guo concluded that the deceased, Wang Zhu, died from opium poisoning and released the body to her husband, Rongqing, for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Amidst the Prevalence of Nanshi Gambling Dens, District Chief Zhang Is Accused of Bribery <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Witness Ren Defu Testifies to Zhang's Acceptance of Bribes</p>
<p>Liu, the District Patrol Officer, Is Highly Involved</p>
<p>The scourge of gambling dens is deeply harmful, and good people resent it to the core. However, due to the negligence of the authorities, they dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Previously, a gambling den headquarters was established in the Xuejiabang area of Nanshi, but it was abruptly shut down due to public criticism. These individuals changed locations, moving from Xuejiabang to the Second District of Ximen, openly operating three sessions a day. District Chief Zhang Dongkai has allowed the gambling dens to flourish, but his own income has not increased accordingly. Liu, the District Patrol Officer, has repeatedly tried to negotiate without success, so he resolutely sent the police to make arrests. However, the gambling den leader, Wang Jiayin, was arrested, and his family argued that the District Chief had previously granted permission, so how could he now ban them? Ren Defu, the witness who handled the negotiations, was constantly harassed by Wang's family and went to the Second District to reason with them. District Chief Zhang and Officer Xie of the Liyuan Road Police Station dismissed his concerns, claiming that the deadline had passed. Ren then filed a lawsuit with the local court.</p>
<p>During the court hearing the day before yesterday, the plaintiff, Ren Defu, testified that he was from Ningbo and lived at number 8, Lane 79, Xiaojiuhua Road. His friend, Wang Jiayin, opened a gambling den in Tanjiazhai in the Second District and asked him to negotiate with Liu, the District Patrol Officer. On the morning of the 14th of last month, he handed 130 yuan to Liu, with District Chief Zhang receiving 50 yuan. When the money was handed over, District Chief Zhang was sitting under a reed canopy in the courtyard of the Second District. Liu handed the money to District Chief Zhang in person. The remaining money was distributed by Liu. The 15 yuan for Officer Xie of the Liyuan Road Police Station was handed directly to Xie in his office. Liu received 20 yuan, and Liu is District Chief Zhang's brother-in-law. On the morning of the 17th, he handed another 30 yuan to Liu. It was clearly stated that the money was for one month's protection fee, but District Chief Zhang refused, saying it could only be counted as one week, and arrests would be made if the deadline passed. Liu vaguely agreed. However, on the morning of the 21st, while the gambling den was in operation, Officer Xie led a large group of police officers and arrested Ren's brother, Ren A'er, claiming that there was no proof of payment and that arrests would be made if the deadline passed. When he was transferred to the Second District Office, Ren negotiated with Liu, who received instructions from District Chief Zhang to release Ren A'er and replace him with someone else, but it would cost 20 yuan as a "longevity fee." Ren reluctantly paid the fee and replaced him with Li Liqing temporarily. Because Wang Jiayin was also arrested by the Second District, Wang's family was constantly harassing him, and he had no choice but to file a complaint with the Municipal Government, the Public Security Bureau, and the court. The addresses and shop guarantees were clearly stated in the written complaint, but neither the Municipal Government nor the Public Security Bureau summoned him for questioning. The reason for this is unknown.</p>
<p>The court ordered Ren Defu to wait outside for a future hearing because the accused officials from the Second District had not arrived. It is reported that Mayor Wu Tiecheng is aware of the situation and is extremely angry.</p>

<h3 id="e170">The Downfall of a Warlord <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— ·Fo·</p>
<p>Zhang Zongchang, known for his "three don't knows" (don't know how many troops, don't know how much money, don't know how many concubines), was stationed in Shandong at the time, and was extremely powerful. The people of Shandong suffered from his tyranny, and to this day, people still turn pale at the mention of his name.</p>
<p>According to reports yesterday, Zhang Zongchang was suddenly attacked at Jinan Station as he was about to leave, and died of serious injuries. Two murderers were arrested on the spot, confessing that they were avenging their father. Alas! The downfall of a warlord is nothing more than this. The saying that "the son of a good doctor often dies of illness, and the son of a good witch often dies by ghosts" means that "one's own way is used to treat one's own body," which is a principle of retribution that never fails.</p>
<p>However, I don't need to delve into Zhang's past deeds, as the world has its own judgment. I don't need to delve into them, and I don't need to make profound comments on Zhang's death, as the inside story is not yet clear. However, there is one commendable thing in Zhang's life:</p>
<p>"I am Zhang Zongchang, not Zhang Bangchang." This kind of heroic tone is as if I can hear his voice. Zhang Zongchang was also extremely opposed to the puppet behavior in the Northeast. Compared with Zheng Xiaoxu, Xi Qia, Zang Shiyi and other foxes and dogs who willingly helped the rebels and acted as accomplices, he was still slightly better.</p>
<p>When Zhang was assassinated, one of the assassins shouted, "I am Zheng Jicheng, son of Zheng Jinsheng, avenging my father!" Then he jumped off the railway and fired several shots at Zhang's head. This assassin is also rare. Ordinary assassins often refuse to reveal their names after assassinating others, but Zheng Jicheng announced his name first, and he is also worthy of being a hero.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, heroes have cherished heroes, and villains have cherished villains. They should not kill each other, but when enemies meet, they are especially clear. Zhang's straightforward words met Zheng Jicheng, who was also straightforward. They met on a narrow road, and Zhang Zongchang had no choice but to die at the hands of his enemy.</p>
<p>Some say that Zhang Zongchang's trip must have involved other activities, and was not as reported in the newspapers, dealing with property disputes. Then I will not bother with this dead account.</p>

<p>Feeling Inspired by the Sound of Crickets in Autumn</p>
<p>The scorching sun fades, and a cool breeze rises gently. The clear sky has no clouds, and the autumn moon is a bright crescent. Holding a book, I sit in my thatched hut, and the shadow of the osmanthus tree moves in the sky. I listen to the chirping of crickets on the mossy steps, endlessly chattering. Like enemies of their own kind, they are not afraid to defend themselves. High and low, they wield their claws and teeth, shouting from the bamboo groves. Risking life and death in a single gamble, these tiny insects are restless. One defeat loses all prestige, one victory makes them arrogant. Humans often kill each other, how much different are they? I will also seal your mouth to avoid laughing at the righteous birds.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Paper Pottery <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— ·Xiao· ·Tao·</p>
<p>Everyone! Before reading this article on paper pottery, please think for a moment, if there were no paper in the world today, how much hardship would people feel! Since paper is an indispensable item, how can we not know how it is made? Now I will write the manufacturing and history of paper below:</p>
<p>In ancient China, there was no paper. In order to record the things that had been done and felt, so as not to forget, bamboo was cut into slips, and lacquer was used to write on the slips. There were also writings on silk, animal skins, or the trunks of plants, and carvings on stone slabs, and even more foolish ways of recording events by tying knots. These methods of recording events were extremely inconvenient. During the reign of Emperor He of the Later Han Dynasty, there was a man from Guiyang named Cai Lun. He was very intelligent and felt that writing in this way was too inconvenient, so he used materials such as hemp fiber, rags, rice straw, and reeds to try to make paper. Where there's a will, there's a way, and his invention was indeed successful. His contribution to mankind is truly great!</p>
<p>Among Western countries, the Egyptians were the earliest to make paper.</p>
<p>Their raw material for making paper was reeds. The paper made from reeds was coarse and thick, and it was difficult to write on. After the method of papermaking in our country was introduced to their country, Austria, Germany, Sweden and other countries opened paper factories and conducted research, and from then on, the method of papermaking in our country spread throughout Europe.</p>
<p>The raw materials for Western papermaking are wood, rags and waste paper. They put the purchased rags and waste paper into a cutting machine to chop them up, put them into a soil removal machine to remove the soil from the waste paper and wash them clean. Then they put them into a large iron pot to cook them thoroughly, remove the original pigments, and put them into a bleaching tank, adding bleaching powder to bleach them. After bleaching, they add glue and chalk (chalk can increase the weight of the paper), then put them into a filter, pass them through a metal mesh to directly press them, to remove moisture, and put them into a dryer, so that the pressed paper is dried and comes out. The reason why Chinese paper breaks when written on with ink is because no glue is added during papermaking. The paper made in our country is too little, and it is often in short supply. Only the sales of Western paper have invisibly increased. Furthermore, because China cannot manufacture its own machines and cannot make full use of domestic raw materials, the paper produced is coarse and rough, neither beautiful nor suitable for writing on both sides with pencils or fountain pens. Although brush can be used, if the ink is too light, it will seep the words into a blob of ink; if it is too thick, it will stick and you cannot write. Therefore, buyers feel that Western paper is cheap, strong and durable, and they scramble to buy and use foreign paper. This leakage has become particularly large, which is a major event that deserves our special attention!</p>
<p>According to a survey report, the value of paper imported by Japan alone is about 2,074,096 taels per year. Such a huge leakage is truly frightening!</p>

<h3 id="e173">Research on Whether Men and Women are Equal Now <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— ·Jin· ·Men·</p>
<p>Equality between men and women: Equality between men and women: It has been shouted for more than twenty years since the change of dynasty. May I ask whether women are now equal to men? If this question is studied carefully, I am afraid that the "not yet" component is more than the "already" component! Before I study this question, I must first ask what exactly constitutes that men and women have already reached equality. This is difficult to answer at once, and can be divided into "broad" and "narrow" meanings. "Narrowly" means equality in all treatments between men and women, and "broadly" includes equality in all treatments and positions between men and women.</p>
<p>Equality in treatment between men and women certainly exists in European and American countries. The old Chinese concepts of "men roam and women hide," "three obediences and four virtues," and "seven grounds for divorce" were extremely unequal, but they have long been naturally eliminated due to the opening up of the country and the eastward spread of European customs. Women are indeed much more liberated than before now, but it cannot be said that they are already equal to men.</p>
<p>Especially with regard to the issue of male-female relationship, it is the most unequal in treatment. Men can have multiple wives, but women can only have one husband. Men can go whoring outside, but women cannot commit adultery at home. Men can remarry immediately after their wives die, and it is very appropriate, but women, although they can also remarry after their husbands die, are annoyed by the difficulties of their parents-in-law and the criticism of relatives and neighbors. It seems that the word "chastity" is used exclusively for women and has nothing to do with men, which is extremely unequal.</p>
<p>However, on the one hand, society shouts loudly for equality between men and women, and on the other hand, it binds them in this way. Why is it so contradictory? This is because women are not yet economically independent and still rely on men for their lives. Old women are certainly like this, but even new women are not much different. Regarding equality in all positions for women, I am afraid that even European and American countries have not reached this level, let alone our country. Because in several national governments, except for a few women in small positions and as members of parliament, there are absolutely no women elected or appointed as prime ministers or ministers, it can also be known that it is very difficult to achieve equal status for women in positions with men.</p>
<p>As for which of the two parties, men and women, is a plaything and who is a slave, this is relative and can be said of both. Men treat new women as playthings, and new women are also treating men as playthings. Men treat old women as slaves, and now new women, who take the money their husbands earn with hard work to go shopping, watch movies, and go to parks, are also treating men as beasts of burden!</p>

<h3 id="e174">A Strange Thing <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— ·Ying· ·Dai·</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, when I came back from Songjiang, I walked through Avenue Road. I accidentally discovered a strange thing. A man in a Western suit, his age was about thirty years old, was holding a child in his arms. This child was only about one year old, and from his small face, it could be determined that his body was unhealthy, perhaps he was sick? Maybe it was a congenital deficiency! The man in the Western suit was holding the child in one hand, and a stack of small red paper bags in the other hand.</p>
<p>In front of him was a middle-aged woman of about the same age as him. In form, they were of course a couple. Her face clearly revealed a kind of melancholy color, frowning, without the slightest smile, leading her husband and child, along the sidewalk beside the road, walking from east to west.</p>
<p>Many people surrounded them to watch the fun. Curiosity urged me, and I couldn't help but stop to see what was going on. I learned that the woman stopped at the door of each house, stopped, and said a few words to the owner. The people in that house put one or two copper coins into the small red paper bag she was holding. The woman handed the bag with money to her husband, and at the same time, she exchanged an empty bag in her husband's hand, and went to another house to ask for copper coins.</p>
<p>Under my eyes, it was really inexplicable. They were a couple who looked very upper-class. Why did they want to ask people for money? The people around were laughing, maybe they were just as puzzled as I was, and some were commenting. Later, I asked the people next to me and learned that they were asking for longevity money, wanting to ask from a hundred families, because the child was sick. Longevity money is to suppress evil spirits and can drive away evil gods and ghosts.</p>
<p>This is really a strange thing. It is so difficult for a beggar to ask people for one or two copper coins, and most people still refuse to give it. But when the couple asked for longevity money, people were very generous in digging into their pockets to give them. In less than an hour, a hundred red bags were filled with copper coins, and then they returned from the original route.</p>
<p>Because I saw them asking for longevity money, it made me have many feelings. In our hometown, the generally ignorant and foolish people, when their children are sick, do not go to see a doctor, but specialize in seeking immortal prescriptions and asking Taoist priests. How can wooden people see a doctor, and how can Taoist priests eliminate demons? As a result, the general small citizens suffer the disaster of death. Unexpectedly, even the intellectual class in the city is so superstitious. From the surface, the man in the Western suit and the woman wearing leather shoes are clearly from the intellectual class, but when their child is sick, they do not go to see a doctor, but use longevity money to suppress evil spirits, isn't it a joke! Under such circumstances, I don't know when the seeds of Chinese superstition will be completely eradicated and eliminated!</p>

<p>— ·Ren·</p>
<p>Zhang's wife and the concubine's son are playing in the patio next door. The son of the wife takes advantage of the fact that his mother has great power and often bullies the son of the concubine. But the son of the concubine is also a child, how can he willingly suffer humiliation? Naturally, these two innocent, lively children often quarrel, and even twist into a ball, hitting each other with their small feet and small hands. Because they feel wronged, their hearts are filled with grievances, and the only way to vent is to cry. So the crying reaches the ears of the wife. She hurried over, without distinguishing right from wrong, and slapped the son of the concubine's mouth a few times first, then hugged her son to the street door, comforting him, "Baby, don't cry, Daddy will buy you a foreign doll when he comes back." But he still cried, until his mother came back from the foreign goods store with a foreign doll in her hand, her little baby smiled through tears, holding the foreign doll, as if forgetting what had just happened.</p>
<p>Over there, the son of the concubine was slapped in the mouth, of course, he cried even harder. The concubine, angered, hugged him to the pavilion and locked the door to let him cry, but she did not comfort him, but used a threatening tone, "Son, do you still want to cry? Be careful that foreigners catch you! The day before yesterday, the A'guan next door was caught by yellow-haired, blue-eyed foreign devils for crying and had his eyes dug out to make meat buns." The son of the concubine did not finish listening, and climbed over in fright to hide his small face in his mother's arms. For a long time, he still coughed up resentful gasps from his weak trachea.</p>
<p>Such a scene is almost what I see every day when I come back from work, and my heart is filled with pain and sorrow. I thought: Is this how Chinese motherhood teaches children? Oh, I understand! It turns out that the Chinese mentality of "liking foreign goods" and "worshipping and fearing foreigners" is deeply planted in the weak hearts of their children by the mothers in their innocent childhood.</p>
<p>Childhood</p>
<h3 id="e176">My Childhood <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>

<p>丨Childhood Memories丨</p>
<p>How precious childhood is, it has passed like flowing water! But I am a big child who likes children. As long as I see their innocent attitude, I am happily fascinated and deeply admire the happiness of childhood. However, there is no hope of reversing time, and God cannot give me to be a child again! This semester, I am in charge of the lowest level arithmetic class, and I am closer to the little brothers and sisters: touching their smiling apple faces, holding their slender little hands, and seeing them wearing beautiful clothes: so I feel that children are really cute.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>Recalling my golden childhood, in the second year of school, I was always naughty in the temple every day. Once, I walked into the side room of the Dacun Temple and boldly took a clay dog and smashed it to pieces. After resting for two days, I got a serious illness. During the illness, according to my mother, "You keep shouting that the little-footed woman and old lady are coming again!" Therefore, I was so anxious that I couldn't sleep or eat, making vows and hiring doctors: I was so busy!" After resting for a week, I recovered from the illness. My mother brought a basket of pancakes and a large pile of incense candles and ingots, and solemnly led me to the temple to worship the wife.</p>
<p>Around the age of eight, every year at the turn of April and May, I went to the bamboo garden with naughty children to find bird nests. If I found small birds like whiteheads, I would be very happy to raise them, as if treating them as small companions. But after a long time, they were either swallowed by cats or starved to death. So I dug a small pond and buried them inside. At the same time, I inserted some fresh flowers and weeds on the mud surface, and sprinkled a bag of tears from my eyes, which was not an unhappy memorial!</p>
<p>When the hot summer arrives, every day I get up early, drag a pair of torn cloth shoes, and carry a very long bamboo pole, running east and west to roll up spider webs. Secondly, I take a small basket and go to the willow trees on the river bank to pick up cicada pupae. After picking them up, I string them one by one on thin white lines and hang them in my mother's room. As soon as the clanging sound of the candy seller comes, I smile and take them to exchange for candy.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve, it was a year of prosperous gambling with my little friends. On a long road that I traveled every day, I drew a ladder-shaped boundary to play the game of throwing copper coins. As soon as I saw my father coming, I scrambled to escape straight to the temple. After school, I secretly went to the Zhang family in the east house and sat on the gate, happily playing with cigarette cards. Like me, I was repeatedly defeated, but the interest in gambling never decreased!</p>
<p>From the age of six, I liked to accumulate large Qing white copper coins, string them together one by one, and put them in my mother's drawer very preciously. By the year I was eleven, I had accumulated five hundred large copper coins. It was really happy, and from that year, I lent eighty copper coins to the old man, the wine fairy on the house, and every year in the tenth month of the lunar calendar, I received one hundred and fifty texts of interest, which was really satisfying.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>This work is narrated nakedly. I deeply feel that in my childhood, I was also a naughty child with the first character in the world. Now, I have some whiskers under my chin, and the biggest child in my family is fully eight years old. Reflecting on the past, it is really a world of difference, like two different people. However, I only hope that an innocent soul will not pass away with the years.</p>
