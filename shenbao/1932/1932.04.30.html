<h3>六十年來之國難</h3>
<p>（一）本報以前滯同治十一年即西歷一千八百七十二年產生迄。於今日恰爲六十週年。廻溯本報產生之際正内承洪楊喪　之餘外遭鴉片戰役與英法聯軍侵襲之後。國勢日益削弱。民生日益窮困。今復内困洪水。外迫强隣九。一八與一二八兩次變亂正不啻爲我制命之創傷。存亡之機。間不容髮。六十年來。每况愈下。如日今日之所遭受者而爲「國。難」則此六十年。中。殆無一日非「國。難」六十年來之本報。亦即可謂爲一部「國難實錄」。一部鞭痕層疊血淚交織之「喪亂日誌」。嗟乎六十年。來憂患環。生再瀕傾覆。然而我民族則終始沉沉酣。夢迄不覺醒再次坐失其自强之機回首　昔誠令人嘆息感喟。末能自已。今日旣已臨到最後之生死綫上。矣我民族其終爲酣夢之睡獅以坐待宰割。乎抑其奮然而起步上陳死新生之坦途乎。茲當本報六十週年紀念之日。爰撮錄六十年來之國難。爲國人警並爲國人　。（二）近世以來。我國家之日處於列强侵凌宰割之下。溯其根源。當以一千八百</p>
<p>四十年鴉片一戰爲發。端鴉片之戰。固自爲時代之必然要求。蓋歐西各國。自產業革命而後。生產力以加速度之勢而發。展資本亦以加速度之勢而累。積勢之所至。自發生市塲與投資地之競。奪維時非洲旣已瓜分完。竣南美亦已無可揰足之地獨我地。大物博之中國。於清之盛時。更挾有東至鄂霍次克。海日本海。西越葱嶺至浩罕。北至恰克圖。南至南海還羅灣。及印度洋之孟加拉灣。西北至巴爾克什湖。及哈蕯克布哈爾。東南至臺灣琉球之廣大藩屬。　然立於太平洋上。自命華夏。夷狄目人。文化旣日即於衰。老經濟亦長淪滯於農業經濟與小手工業經濟之堦段自爲先進之資本主義列强所埀。涎然而斯時劃强固尙不明瞭我古老國家之實力。未敢輕易以武力敲門而闖。入鴉片之戰英以軍士一萬五千人。軍艦二十六。艘竟長驅而直入。陷定海。鎖寗波進迫天津。繼復攻閩浙。連陷厦門定海寗波乍浦寳山上海而向逼南。京終於簽訂南京條約。割香港。開商埠。賠軍費。肇不平等條約之始端列。强乃知龐大之中國固。極易與。於是法美紛來要求。而中法條約中美條約。乃相繼簽訂。居留地之設立。裁判權之讓與。關税値百抽五及最惠國條欵之規。定換言之。即西歐先進資本主義國家侵略我國之基礎乃以此戰而確立。而自茲以後。資本主義列强遂以我國爲投資地爲銷貨塲。爲原科出產所。往日之相互通商。迄茲乃變而爲單方面之侵略。</p>
<p>由於產業先進國經濟勢力之激盪。我落後之農業經濟乃顯呈變化。而人民反　帝國主義運動。亦因之蓬勃而起。益以一千八百四十七年粤西大○。太平天國之原始農民暴動。及所謂「捻亂」。遂先後爆發。擾攘十年。縱横十餘省乃得鎮定。而國計民生。於是已受創極重矣。</p>
<p>一千八百五十七年以廣東人。民之反抗英人英法復聯軍陷廣州。一千八百五十八年英法美俄聯軍又陷大沽。逼天津。迫訂天津條約。一千八百六十年英法聯軍更長驅入北京。焚圖明園。確立天津條約之有效。帝俄復乘機要求訂立中俄北京條約。於是我國之門户乃全部開放。領土行政主權。乃日益破碎不全。而半殖民地之地位乃日益確立。撫今追昔。雖日資本主義國家之東向侵略。要爲產業革命後爲時代轉變之必然要。求換言之。即工業經濟必然摧毀農業經濟之藩籬。而要求其工業化。然而清室之　預。不能體認世界潮流之趨勢。徒故步自封。夜郎自大。驕變荒淫。憑民以自固其統治地位。使文化停滯。經濟落後。要亦爲其最大之根因也。</p>
<p>（三）（吾人旣已瞭然於鴉片戰爭之爲我國「國縣」之發端。換言之即資本帝國主義以經濟力與政治力變管齊下對我侵略之發端。今請歸至最近之六十年。</p>
<p>最近之六十。年吾人前已言之。起自一千八百七十二。年即清同治十一年。即清同在此吾人不能不特爲提示。者即維時西方之資本主義國家。固正欣欣以向榮。而東方之日本。亦以一千八百六十八年之明治維新。步上資本主義之道路。日本之維新。其主要原困。固由於西方帝國主義之侵略美國黑船首先○入。敲破其門户。英法各國繼至。迫訂不平等條約之剌激。而另一方面則由於我國鴉片戰役之敗衂。益使彼怵於西方帝國主義列强之强大而慓慓危懼。不得不奮起維新以圖存。維新而後。朝野一心。政治修明。廢除不平等條約。以求民族之獨立自由。模仿西方文化。發展產業。追踵西方之資本主義先進國而起。於是國力日張。儼然爲東亞之一新與民族。鴉片戰爭之結果。未能喚醒我國人之沉沉酣。夢未能振與我民族。而日本乃因而得救。乃因而奮發自强。寖以爲我國心腹之大患。是則由於我民族之醉生夢死。因循苟安。而爲吾人在今日所應認清者也。</p>
<p>日本以貧弱之鳥國。一旦維新蜕變而爲以輕工業立國之資本主義國家。先天旣薄弱。後天亦虧損。故始即呈現凶横殘酷之面目。維新而後。舉目環顧。西歐固已無可問之鼎。南美亦無可以挿足之餘地。惟近鄰之中國。尙未爲西歐資本主義先進國所正式分割。其以我國爲侵略之對象。固爲勢所必然。日本侵我之第一着。即爲步西歐列强之後塵。要求與我正式通商。一千八百七十一年與我締結通商條約十八欵。一千八百七十二年約復改訂。一千八百七十三年法侵安南。陷河内。迫訂法越和親條約。翌年。日本亦藉口台灣生蕃殺害日商人。遣西鄉從道進攻番社。卹欵五十萬兩。兵始撤。邊疆遂從此多事。一千八百七十六年即光緖二年。英譯員經雲南被。匪戕害。交涉之結果。迫我訂烟台條約。開宜昌蕪湖温州北海爲商埠。一千八百七十九年。日突滅琉球。改爲冲繩縣。是爲日本南進海洋政策之第一步。一千八百八十四年。時法拿破崙第三稱帝。再攻安。南中法遂宣戰。始初敗衂。繼以劉銘傅等督師。戰屢捷。斃法將孤拔。法進退頗感維谷。然以清室之○預。眛彼國情翌年。遂與法講。和承認安南爲法之保護國。并開龍州蒙自蠻耗爲商埠。於是安南便不復爲我所有。一千八百八十六年英復併缅甸。缅甸遂亡一千八百八十八年。英復窺藏。一千八百九十。年英迫訂藏印條約八欵。一千八百九十二年訂藏印通商辦法九條。開亞東爲商埠。翌年。復訂藏印通商遊牧條約九欵。藏邊從茲遂顯然爲英國之勢力範園。資本主義列强自鴉片戰後。由脅迫開放門户。銷售商品。至是乃顯轉而爲分割殖民地。各確立其進取之路向然。而斯時清廷則慈禧擅權。國政日壤。主昏臣庸罔知大勢。外患紛來。無以防禦。於是寖以致一千八百九十四年即光緖二十年中日戰役之慘敗。以此一敗。我國際地位乃一蹶而不可復振。</p>
<p>日本之侵我。自明治以來。即旦夕籌謀。不遺餘力。其所謂南進政策。與北進政策。即爲侵我之兩大路綫。南進旣已併琉球。於是更北進而窺朝鮮。一千八百九十四年遂乘朝鮮内亂之機。派兵至鮮。積極挑　。列強皆取望態度。於是中日以積年宿怨。遂正式宣戰。一千八百九十五年戰屢敗陣軍旣紛紛退却。海軍亦全殲。虎山九。連安東鳳　城大東。溝大孤山岫嚴皆陷東洋第一要塞之旅須及威海衛亦落於日人之手。渤海南北門户皆爲日軍佔領遂。東半島亦全部陷落。日軍更南向窺台灣及澎湖列島。思佔爲南海海軍根據地。此一慘敗。舉國震動。以美國之斡旋。幾經交涉。始於一千八百九十五年由李鴻章爲全權代表。依日本最低限度之要求。與日訂立最令吾人痛心疾首之馬關條約。其最重要者爲承認朝鮮獨立自主。割讓奉天南部。遼東灣東岸黄海北岸屬於奉天諸島舉。台灣全島及澎湖列島。賠償軍　二萬萬兩。取得我國内河之航行權等。於是朝鮮台灣澎湖列島以及遂東半島。遂實際皆入於日人。掌握之中</p>
<p>經此戰後。我國之　際地位。乃更一落千丈。四十年來。我國之陷入列强蹂𨈆宰制之悲壤而無以自據。實以此一戰爲其關鍵。而此戰之　。則由於外不能○國際局勢。不能洞曉日本之國情。内復不能一德一心。和衷共濟。疆東劃○自守。權臣掣肘於朝戰和旣不能早决。旣戰復不能全國動員。準備長時期之苦鬭。一戰而敗。遂惶惶議和。此戰之結果。不僅爲歐美各國所不及料。實亦日人所不及料。歐人評此戰爲非中國與日本戰。特直隷一省與日本戰。非直隷一省與日本戰。特李鴻章個人與日本戰。鳴呼。以散漫若沙之民族。當新界之民族。欲其不敗。顧可得耶。往事不忘。後事之師。然而今日之事。又果何若耶。甲午戰後。日所得極多。尤以遼東半島之租借。最爲帝俄所眼紅。於是乃有德法俄三國之。聯合干涉還遼。三國干涉之結果。遼東在名義上雖已歸還我國。但因此轉而失沿海之良港。及内地種種之主權。一千八百九十七年德藉口山東曹州敎案。派艦入膠州灣。佔青島砲台。迫訂租借條約。一千八百九十八年。俄復藉德據膠州灣之口實。亦派艦入旅順旋。又藉口防禦他國侵犯滿洲。要求租借旅順大連。并築造自哈爾濱至旅順之鐵道。迫我正式訂約。我以三千萬爾贖自日人之遼東半島。茲乃雙手奉以予俄。而滿洲之全部。亦遂概爲俄人之勢力圈。至於法國。自佔安南後。即鋭意經營我南部諸省。一千八百九十七年。亦曾向我要求海南島不讓與他國。及延長龍州鐵道。開採兩廣雲南鑛山。修繕滇越間通商鐵道兩欵。翌年。以德租膠州灣。俄租旅大。英要求長�</p>
<p>江流域不割讓與他國。日本要求福建不割讓與他國。遂亦以「均勢」爲辭。要求租借廣州灣九十九年。及廣東廣西雲南三省不割讓與他國等四條。一千八百九十九年廣州灣附近忽殺害法士官二人。傅敎士一人。法遂派艦直入灣内。迫我締結廣州灣租借條約。租期亦爲九十九年。英亦於一千八百九十八年迫我承認租借威海衛。繼又以法租廣州灣要求租借九龍以爲抵制。九龍之租借條約。亦於同年訂立。</p>
<p>故以甲午之敗。而列强無理之要求乃紛至沓來。三數年間。沿海良港。盡落人手俾各國都確立其侵略之根據地。更明白劃分勢力範圍。作瓜分之準備。主權日失。疆土日　。此一時期。實爲我國最危殆之時期其所以未亡者。僅以列强均勢之故。雖然遠東競爭之風雲日緊。而國際資本帝國主義者列强間之衝突益日亟矣。故甲午一戰。殆可謂爲我民族之制命創傷。亦即劃時期之界石。</p>
<p>在此時期。清德宗以外侮紛至。國勢日　。怵於國亡之無日亦頗有意奮起圖强一千八百九十八年以康有爲梁啓超等之力主維新。遂實行變法親政。而有所謂維新運動。但卒以慈禧守。舊力反新政。捕康梁。殺楊深秀等六人。制德宗。使不得行其志。政仍復舊。賄賂公行。寵宦官。任　小。摧士氣剶民權。於是而一綫曙光。乃復幻滅。國勢乃日以衰徵。雖然。維新之不成。要亦由於當時我國經濟落後。封建經濟尙根深蒂固。而資本主義經濟則尙未萌芽。故終無以戰勝封建勢力。而走上維新之路。時代之背景使然。初非由於慈禧一人之阻撓也。</p>
<p>（四）由於外患之刺激。與滅亡之恐怖。國人對於外族之仇恨。亦潛滋暗長。積怨日深。伺機而爆發一廣太之反抗行動。一千八百九十八。年白蓮敎支派義和團起於山東。以排外爲口號。以端王與剛毅等之迷信翼助。勢乃益張。由山東蔓延及於直隷全省。殺害外國敎士。時有所聞。一千九百年直隷易州鄉民與天主敎徒涉訟而敗。義和團乃乘機鼓動。焚毁敎堂。殺敎徒六十餘人。毁鐵道。斷電○。北京各國公使遂太起恐慌。急召英法俄德美日意七國水兵入北京。保護使館。　王則又免　劻廖　恒等之戰。代之以啓秀徐桐等排外分子。更檄排外派甘肅提督羣福祥之軍隊移駐京師。以張義和團之勢。未幾。董部遂殺死　公使書記員杉山彬。義和團且火焚京内外各敎堂及外人住宅。政府更决議保護義和團。拒絕外兵登陸。於是義和團更有所恃而無恐。遂爆發廣大之排外運動。殺外人焚敎堂之事。北方各地。幾於無處無之。</p>
<p>排外運動既起。各國公使館亦被圍攻。英俄法德美日意奥八國聯軍二千五百人。由天津向北京出發。被困於廊房楊村間。各國軍艦遂聚攻大沽砲豪。陷之大沽陷後三日。德公使林德克又被戕。戰機日迫。遂宣戰。張之洞李鴻章等疏陳利害。皆不省。一千九百年六月十三日。聯軍遂攻陷天津。未幾。復陷楊村與通州。慈禧與德宗倉皇夜走。輾轉至長安。聯軍遂以七月二十一日入北京。分區管轄。大肆刧掠。京都之菁華與數千年　史上之寳物。都刦掠一空。是爲自一千八百七十二年以來我國都之第二次陷落。而俄人亦於是時衆機佔領東三省。并迫我人民投溺黑龍江。死者多至三千人。</p>
<p>首都旣破。帝室出走。官吏亦星散。遂呈無政府之狀態。當時聯軍中主張實際瓜分我國之議頗盛。復以各國均勢力敵。無法支配。且有數國欲市恩於我國故議無成。後以李鴻章奉命媾和。幾經交涉。始訂立城下之盟之北京條約。　下我民族永永無可磨滅之奇恥大辱。此次條約最要之點。爲削平北京大沽間之砲臺各要塞之無期佔領。公使館區域之劃定。賠償鉅大數目字之軍費。故和議雖成。而我首都仍不啻被椌制於列强掌握之中。東交民巷則尤顧然爲我國之太上政府。又以賠欵四百五十兆兩及其利息。對於我國家財政及國民經濟更爲一制命之打擊。</p>
<p>此一國難。一爲由於我民族文化程度之落後。人民知識低落。不能以有組織有計劃之行動。發動廣大之反帝運動。徒激於感情。迷信天神。參加者旣爲一般流氓無產者鳥合之衆。領導者更爲一般昏庸之貴族與官僚。再加以我破產之農業國家。决無以當國際資本主義國家聯合之壓力。故此一繼亂。其意義雖爲悲壯之民族運動。其實質則仍爲一種原始之暴動。反抗之結果。卒歸於悲慘之朱敗。固亦勢所必然。獨是經此變亂。而清室仍終始毫不覺悟。慈禧等在長安。且存「此間樂不思蜀」之念。苟安旦夕。返京而後。復大興土木。移海軍費用以修治圓明園。政治日以紊亂。民生日以窮困。誤國禍國。致我民族今日枷鎖重重。長淪於帝國主義者蹂躪之下。皆清室之昏庸　頇有以致之也。國難旣亟。民怨日深。辛亥革命之爆發夫豈偶然。雖然。居今視昔。陳跡體歷。吾人固悲憤末能自已。後日視今。則又何如。此則又爲吾人在今日所應三思者也</p>
<p>八國聯軍迫訂北京條約之後。帝國主義列强間在遠東之衝突。乃更形緊張。一千九百零二年英日同盟以制俄。俄法亦同盟以相抵制。斯四國者。皆以割取我國之土地。攫取我國之權利爲目的者。也尤以日俄爲競奪東三省。衝突更日益顯明。卒之於一千九百零四年爆發日俄之戰。以我國東北爲戰場。戰之結果。俄敗。訂朴茨茅斯條約。復以我國之土地與主權爲戰利品。旅大從此又轉入日本之手。制我東北死命之南滿鐵道。亦以此戰而確立。東北遂有所謂南滿北滿之劃分儼然爲日俄分。有之勢力範團。一千九百一十年日復正式併朝鮮。於是日本北進政策。乃得初步之成功。而我東北去年九一八突發之禍變。亦即於是時種植其禍根。</p>
<p>維時已至清室之末葉矣。迭經喪亂。國勢危殆。已岌岌不可終日。人民反帝運動旣已迭遭失敗。於是乃知非推　專制政體。根本澄清内政。不足以言對外。辛亥之前。孫中山先生領導之同盟會。革命運動已如火如茶。至於辛亥（即一九一一年）遂一舉而顯覆滿清。建立民國開我國。歷史之新紀元。并推</p>

<p>我國家步入一新階級。</p>
<p>辛亥革命之成功。實爲我國維新之一好機會。人民葬不仰首企盼光明之到來。然而以當時封建經濟之比重。仍强於資本主義經濟。辛亥革命之領導階級。力量極爲脆弱。故不旋踵又返入黑暗時期。而形成封建軍閥紛爭割據之局面。國是更呈江河日下之勢。</p>
<p>（五）民國建立之第三年即一千九百十四年。各帝國主義者以矛盾衝突之深刻擴大。無法解决。第一次世界大戰遂於以爆發。大戰爆發之後。歐美列强都捲入殘酷之屠場。無暇東顧。此一時期。又爲我奮起圖强之絕好機會。但復以袁世凱當政。謀復帝制。與日深相結納。欲藉其勢以實現其帝制之酣夢。日本乃一方。面乘歐戰方酣。一方面又乘袁之利令智昏。欲一舉而席捲我國。一千九百十四年遂以對德宣戰爲名。占領我國之青島。更於一千九百十五年突然對我提出極其苛刻幾等於滅亡我國之二十一條。並迫我嚴守秘密。袁世凱但求其「皇帝夢」之早日實現。不惜賣國利已。除原提條件略有修正外。餘遂於是年五月九日。不經國曾之通過。秘密簽定。</p>
<p>二十一條之實質。殆即無異於認我爲日之保護國。此約而實行。則我國雖名未亡而實已亡。日本之大陸政策。亦於可以慶祝其全部實現。軍閥之醉心權利。甘心賣國。其罪殆眞不容於死也。</p>
<p>此一時期。爲我國於八國聯軍之後。又一危難時期。後以國人紛起反對。根本否認二十一條賣國條約。而歐戰結朿。列强亦紛起詰責抗議。美國且鄭重提示門户開放機會均等之原則。約乃擱未實行。</p>
<p>然而袁世凱經此刺激。仍不覺悟。一千九百十六年遂稱帝。改元洪憲。衆叛親離。各省紛樹反對之幟。袁羞○而死。洪○帝制。終成幻夢一場。後一年。安徽奉天陜西等省以反對國會及○法。脱離中央而獨立。兩廣兩湖等省以反對解散國會。亦宣告獨立。是年復有張勳擁宣統復辟之變。自茲以後。遂入於軍閥割據之局面。内戰連年。政如亂絲。水旱洊至。，民不堪命。軍閥紛爭。此仆彼興。各以帝國主義者爲靠山。各以擴張武力攘奪利權爲能事。種種不平等條約之訂立。利權之斷送。皆明目張胆爲之。毫無忌憚。自民元以後十數年來。我民族誠不啻陷入十八層黑暗地獄之底。維時乃有一綫之光明。滋長於東南之一隅。是即北伐以前之國民黨也。</p>
<p>國民黨本孫中山先生之三民主義。艱難奮鬥。經一千九百二十四年之改組。更確定革命之基礎。集中革命之力量。勢力乃日益張大一千九百二十六年遂於廣東揭舉國民革命之旗幟。誓師北伐。以人民之擁護與扶助。師行所至。勢如破竹。得於最短期間。克武漢。定寗滬。建都南京。此一時期。廢除不平等條約。肅清封建勢力。建立民主政權之呼聲。震動河　。世界人士對於我國。耳目都爲之一新。謂東方之睡獅。今已醒來。世界之局面。即將以中國革命之成功。而發生變化。即我人民亦莫不歡欣鼓舞。以爲今後庶幾其得以出水火而登袵席。我民族庶幾其得以鎚碎不平等條約之枷鎖而恢復其獨立自由。迨第二次北伐。進至濟南。日本帝國主義者懼革命勢力之伸張。與其勢力範圍之被打破遂由暗中之破。壤阻撓。突然進而爲武力干涉。二次出兵山東。砲擊濟南。而五三慘案遂於以造成。</p>
<p>五三事件旣已發生。我全國人民憤激異常。抗日運動遂一時如火如荼。但政府則極力隠忍退讓。其後輾轉交涉。至一千九百二十九年三月始簽定解决濟案臨時協定。而日兵始撤退。此爲一千九百二十七年國民革命以後之第一次國難。至今濟南城頭。彈痕宛在。血跡猶新。然而當時如火如荼之抗日運動。不旋踵而即消滅。又寗料在五年後之今日。更復有東北禍幾與上海禍變危殆之情勢更十倍於濟案耶。</p>
<p>第二次北伐。雖中經五三之變但師行仍極迅速。而北洋軍閥官僚政客亦順應環境。搖首一變而爲國民黨員。黨政府以急於博取統一全國之虚名亦兼收並蓄。於是而軍閥官僚概高據要津。彼時日帝國主義以其在華北勢力。將根本動搖。遂於一千九百二十八年伺奉張之倉皇回奉。炸斃於皇姑屯車站。欲乘東北之亂而襲取之。謀未遂。迨東北易幟。日本復極力阻撓。亦未成功於是其謀奪取我東北之野心至是乃益急矣。</p>
<p>迄於去年。由於資本主義經濟之轉入第三期。而動搖凋落無以自持。日本以根基脆弱之資本主義國家。更陷入不景氣之深淵。工業衰落。贸易减縮信。用恐慌。失業激增。農產物價格低落。濔漫三島之不景氣。遂迫使其實力發動。重新分割殖民地奪取市塲與原料地。積極準備第二次之世界大戰。於是而去年九一八東北禍變。以及今年一二八上海禍變。乃先後爆發。此兩次變亂。即吾人今日所悲憤號呼之國難。身之所歷。當尙未至淡忘。故於其詳情。概略而不述。</p>
<p>（六）吾人叙述六十年來之國難旣竟。覺未能已於一言。自鴉片戰爭而後。近百年來。我國歷經變亂。無日不處於危急存亡之艱境。如日「多難興邦。」如日「無敵國外患者國恒亡。」則我國國難不可謂不多。敵國外患更不可謂少。然而時至今日。仍不能自拔。甚且日即於危境者。則又何耶。古有云。「國必自侮。而後人侮之國必自伐。而後人伐之。」於此。吾人不能不承認我國家之所以長處於列强侵凌之下。概由於民族精神之散漫。内政之黑暗。今太平洋上風雲日益緊急。我國又恰爲太平洋問題之重心。換言之。即爲資本帝國主義列强爲謀挽救其最後崩潰之命運而競奪之對象。故經歷此次之國難。而我民族仍不覺醒。仍不一致努力。以圖自存。則前途黝黑如漆。或者今茲即爲最後一次之國難。此則又爲吾人所不能不切實認清者也。</p>
<p>於此。吾人對於執政之國民黨。更不能無一言。國民黨自一千九百二十六年誓師北伐。以能切實代表人民之利益。故能博取人民之擁護。不數年間。即統一全國。成爲領導革命主政之黨。五六年來。固不乏自强之機。然而天下既定黨之革命精神遂亦銷磨罄盡軍閥政治與官僚政治重新抬頭國成割據黨成分裂。爭奪權利。内戰迭興。尤以前年内戰。相持年餘。死兵三十萬。爲充作軍費而發行之公債亦數萬萬元。凡此戰亂。實皆爲斷喪我國家元氣之斧斤。實皆爲召至外侮之磁石。換言之。亦實即致今日國難之惡因。假使政府今日而能移襄日内戰持久苦鬥之精神以禦外侮。以應付今日之國難　。當前雖情勢危急。亦復何憂。獨是就目前情形而言。軍人仍割據自雄。黨政領袖仍虚言訓政。不肯予人民以共同救國之機。而舊政客官僚則復乘機侈談憲政。企圖死灰復燃。是豈必舉我國家我民族我四萬萬人民以同殉此最後。之國難耶</p>
<p>吾人認爲今日而欲謀打破國難。求我民族之出路。人民必須培養摧毁軍閥政治與官僚政治之實力。政府必須有負責廉潔眞實代表人民利益之幹部。以澄清政治。重新奠定我國基。庶幾可免我國家於分割。庶可以推進我民族步入新生之路。土其耳之復興。即我前例。國人伹當急起一致奮鬥。光明在前陳死新生。此爲最後之時機。江流蕩蕩。我民族之前途正無涯際也。</p>

<h3>美國願意供給蘇俄武器</h3>
<p>▲以圖抑制日本</p>
<p>大阪朝日新聞華盛頓特電最近美國對於承認蘇俄問題大爲一般社會所注目其動機起因於日俄兩國形勢之惡化美國上院多數議員以爲日俄兩國萬一發生衝突時美國爲供給雙方武器之立塲「美國即不承認蘇俄亦不致不供給武器」此種意見已在議員口中非公式的發表彼輩又極力促胡佛大總統之决意惟胡佛對於承認意見僅贊成蘇俄政府之政治組織至於在廣汎的範圍内似不敢首肯但承認蘇俄運動美國上院已漸傾於决議之趨勢特上院外交委員辟德孟氏與其他有力議員對於承認蘇俄第一爲通商條約與債務處理等之形式須由大總統自身行之故就目下之情勢而論美國雖無急急承認之可能性然主張對俄供給武器以抑制日本避免日俄間之决裂實爲一般人所公認云</p>

<h3>本報六十年來之鱗爪</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑黄寄萍</p>
<p>人生六十年恰恰是一個花甲子漸漸地覺得精力日襄起來腰傴了背曲了皮庸皺了鬆髮斑白了在一生的歷程中確是已到了「夕陽無限好只是近黄昏」的時候了於。是對人家説客氣話時總以「老朽」自稱俗諺中也就有「人老珠黄」不値錢的一句老話其。實老年人未必一定是「老朽」也未必一定是「不値錢」孔夫子周遊列國已在花甲以外差太公八十遇文王更是人所共知。便是西方的偉大人物也大半在晚年成大名成大業的美。國大發明家愛迪生年過八十還在發明新事物造福人羣歐。戰中的大英雄護飛福煦海格三大將都是以六十餘歲的高年爲國家效命疆塲。德國的大總統興登堡現年雖已八十有五還在百折不回的爲國奮門。這些人眞是「老當益壯」决非一般青年們所可企及。於人如此於報紙亦然。我們申報自出世以來已滿了六十花甲子在報界中可算是一位老大哥。但是老雖老了而精力未襄健旺猶昔看它那虎虎有生氣的現像眞的是返老還意了。以前的六十歲一笨勾銷從今年起便是一個生　週歲的小弟弟看它一年年生長起來發掦蹈厲的做一番事業。我們奉了主者之命且把本報六十年來的事情擇要一説留作紀念。可是瘦鵑給申報服務只十餘年寄萍只二三年如何能擔得起這一項大工作呢。幸而我們還有一些參考的材料又有幾位前輩先生可作我們的顧問因此就凑成了這一籍本報六十年來之鱗爪。</p>
<p>（一本報創始於民國紀元前四十年即前清同治十一年壬申創辦人爲美查氏（Ｍajor)他是英國籍當時他在華經營的事業一是江蘇藥水廠一是集成圖書公司一即申報館外人在華辦報美查實開風氣之先。第一任主笨爲蔣君芷湘華經理爲趙君逸如每兩日出報一張用國貨毛太紙印刷篇幅很小所載都詩文之類間或有中外近事不過用以點綴閲者也不甚重視。在本報誕生號的徴稿條例上説「如有名言儻論有關乎國計民生地利水源之類者上關皇朝經濟之需下知小民稼穡之苦附登斯報概不取酬。」可見當初投稿除了上述範圍之外還得納相當刋費和現在情形適得其反。此時社會優秀份子大都醉心科舉人肯從事於新聞事業惟有落拓文人疏狂學子或借報紙發抒抑　無聊的興各埠訪員摭述報告的如里巷瑣聞無關國家民生大計即使得之也不敢形諸筆墨觸犯當局之怒其。實言論不自由莫説專制時代便是民國也何嘗自由本報三月廿三日創刋出了五期自三月卅日起改爲日刋。翌年臺灣生番殺了高　人日本興師問罪美查親自採訪把眞相完全露佈因此大家才明白報紙的功能爭先購閲日銷數千份聲譽鶕起。毛太紙改了賽連紙便於印刷由是朝廷諭旨及緊要新聞改用電報飛傅。後來蔣君高就繼任爲錢君昕伯鋭意革新把信筆點綴等傅奇小説之類一概摒棄注重新聞美查很贊成他們計劃打定之後分工進行。到了越南起事中法交戰他報諱敗爲勝以取悦讀者　查則僱一俄人隨法營探報旣詳且確一般人反誤爲偏袒法人幾以申報爲衆矢之的那時與申報競爭的爲滬報它用範絡閲者的手段鼓吹華軍勝利結果華軍的弱點暴露全國震怒正和現在中日戰爭主張不抵抗的軍人先後如出一軌結果國人皆知戰事的失敗而申報之寃於天下因此銷數激增求登廣告的户限爲穿乃增印附張賽連紙再改用外洋機器紙。又過了數年美查表示申報總算辦理得有成績感覺自已精力衰退兼之新創其他的實業也次第告成正是急流勇退的時機乃以由申報改爲公司委他的同鄉芬林阿拍拿繼代。在當時申報獨家經營自然成效桌著。其後主筆黄君式權華經理席君子眉主持全館此時適値中國政治革新之際中外日報等應運而起報紙也有了革新的機會。光絡三十年後申報便脱離了洋商的關係大加改革經理爲席君子偑主筆黄君因老病辭職乃任金君劍華爲總主筆雷君　等一班舊編輯照常服務悉心規劃鋭意整理申報又漸入於興盛的時代這是現總理接辦以前經過的情形。</p>

<h3>六十壽言</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>甲乙二客談中文報紙之壽命。甲言。莫壽於香港之循環日報。自天南遯叟主編以後。歷傅至今。已六十八塞署矣。報之老者。無出其右。</p>
<p>乙日。否否。港報雖老。然非我國領土以内之報紙。似當别論。本國報紙之壽命最長歷史最悠久者。首推行年六十之申報。</p>
<p>繼夾二先生聞而笑日。申報雖老。未云老也。吾聞最老之報莫老於八十餘年之興都報。</p>
<p>甲乙兩客咸怪其言。以爲我國報紙雖多。然八十餘年之興都報。似未前聞。或者先生又纒夾耶。</p>
<p>纒夾二先生則堅言其確有。且云。近日海上報紙。多載此八十餘年興都報之歷史。君等當亦聞之。</p>
<p>乙恍然日。先生誤矣。此興登不堡。非興都報也。此德總統。非新聞紙也。甲笑日。以興登堡比申報。亦頗相當。興登堡老當益壯。申報亦老當益壯興登堡得數千萬人之擁戴。而爲德意志大總統。申報亦得數千萬人之歡迎。而爲新聞界之大王。纒夾二先生之言。雖纒夾。未纒夾也。因作贊日。</p>
<p>行年六十老申報。年逾八十興登堡。二老天下之大老。老當益壯。雖老猶少。六十學打拳。不遲也不早。六十年風水輪流轉。弱者强矣强者倒。禍福倚伏未可知。白眼看他扶桑島。</p>
<h3>周而復始</h3>
<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>報紙爲灌輸文明。溝通智識之媒介物。覘國之强弱盛衰。恒以其報紙之量之多寡。質之高下爲斷。本報之誕生。遠在六十年前。爾時海禁初開。吾人猶故步自封。於歐美之文化學術。有若霧中看花。莫名眞相。迨本報乘時崛起。爲引渡文明之先航。啓迪民智之前驅。六十年來對於輸運誘掖之責。可謂盡矣。顧廻溯旣往此。六十年中。民智之啓發。國魂之覺醒。固已有若干進步。而總概其全。結果猶未能滿意。蓋吾人値此過渡時期。對於歐美之文明。認識未清。採擇不謹。剽襲墓仿。亦步亦趨。於是削足適履。棄精用麤。成效未著。弊病百出。個人生活。則習於物質之享用。進求無饜。敎育政治。及一切社會事業。則流於商業化廣告化。粉飾而不務實。寖假而至驕奢逸樂。貪黷虚僞。迨乎今日。災禍迭作。險象環生。國運一息。不絕如縷。然此豈報紙之罪。要在吾人之舍精華而取糟粕。盲於選擇耳。</p>
<p>吾國舊歷。向以干支紀年。六十年爲一甲子。周而復始。今本報已出周而復始之年。吾國家遭遇重大之外患。全國憶悟。亦在絕續交替之時。吾深願本報本旣往之精神。繼往開來。創造其更偉大更有效率之新生命。對於國内爲適合國情及環境之指導。務求刻苦崇實。獎進建設。謀理智之發展。而抑遏自私苟安虚僞囂張之陋習。對外來之介紹。則盡量提倡科學法治團體奮鬥諸精神。庶使炎　之胃。有重新抬頭於世界舞台之一日。而本報未來之光榮。亦將因新史之創著而並傅不朽焉。</p>
<h3>杖鄉之慶</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>獃子讀舊唐書。「以後年有祥瑞。俱令申報有司。不得上聞。」詫日。申報唐時已有之。莫怪今人稱申報爲老申報也。此固一笑話。然申報資格絕老。至今已有六十年歷史。我儕後進。對於花甲之申報。自當以父執尊之也。按諸古禮六。十杖於鄉。七十杖於國。八十杖於朝。德望與年俱大。身分與年俱高。申報之六十周。是不過杖鄉之慶也。將來銷數與年俱加。信　與年俱進。則七十周·八十周。不知又將何若。予固馨香祝之也。且予撰稿申報自由談也。屈指已數年。追隨杖履。深得誨導。於其杖鄉之慶。爰綴數語以頌之。聊代晉觴上壽焉。</p>

<p>某年鴛雛輩以林琴南文體作小説余。亦戲仿之。成數十篇。其中有題「離鸞記」者。述一被遺棄之婦人。憔悴可憐。無或中加以援手。意致惻憫。忽有錢君自白下貽書。間離鸞姓氏里居。並自言願爲之耦。余乃告以事屬子虚。聊寄感喟。可知文字感人之深矣。移家吴下每清游。佳日春秋有地留。星散何從求俊侶。無多文字記蘇州。初來吴下。幾於無日不游。無游不記。無記不寄申報刋之。星社之樂亦。始於攪勝之餘。惜爲日無多。俊侶星散。蘇州佳勝。未能遍及耳。</p>

<h3>沈著之規</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>沈者不浮之意。著者有定之詞此兩字似是平常。而實具絕大作用。故觀戀必日沈機。實行必日著手。爭先者必爭先著。尙勇者莫尙勇沈。今後國人應。付國難。爲術萬端。而予以沈著爲規。固亦持之有故。諸君不憶一二八後各報館之戰報乎。一則日敵分幾路來攻。我軍沈著應戰。再則日敵以機砲衝炸。我軍沈著應戰。沈著沈著。屢書不一書。良以敵軍海陸空齊舉。器械精利。我軍設備上有遜色焉。在勢幾不可與戰。而猶能殺傷過當。迨其後爲有秩序之退却。尤行軍之所難能。沈著之效率。偉大如此。此非徒觀戰者之言。抑亦蔡廷楷軍長所自承者也。方作戰間。吾宗陶家瑤。以法團代表謁蔡軍長。軍長談話中。有如下述之數語。「諸君非憎惡中國武人之内戰乎。但非連年内戰。則軍隊没有打仗的經騐。那有這樣勇敢而又沈著的好兵呢。」就蔡軍長之言繹之。是沈著工夫。絕非容易。蓋純由經騐得來。戰事如此。政事何獨不然。今後吾人奔走救國。必須注重政治經騐。以趨於沈著之一途。舉國上下。分工合作。切切實實的去幹。自有因敗爲功轉禍爲福之一日。若猶一味貼標語喊口號。發宣。言打通電。算舊賬唱高調。這眞是尊範不敢承敎了。往昔甲午之衂。予所躬覩。國民多數茫然漠然。自不如今日民氣激昻之可喜。然往往羣衆一時高興起哄。亦覺可憂。爲其虚憍而幼稚也。不觀三月初忽爾大放其爆竹乎。故甲午以來。可謂朦懂時代。革命以後可命之日一哄時代。繼自今須進而爲沈著時代。越十年。申報作七十週刋。可云成功時代。則予之此規。爲不虚獻矣。</p>
<h3>申報六十年紀念</h3>
<p>— 王天恨</p>
<p>人生如白駒過隙。上古之世。猶多百歲外。降及今世。則能歷六十寒署以上者·即爲長壽矣。申報之刋行。已閲六十年。我嘗發一奇想。求諸今日。亦有壽逾七八十。曾自申報第一號起。綿亘不間。閲覽至今。而其人尙健在。猶逐日閲覽否。竊恐壽逾七八十者固有之。曾閲及第一號申報者亦有之。閲及第一號申報而其人至今尙存者亦有之。若自第一號至今。六十年來。未有一日間斷。則必絕無其人也。脱竟有之。則眞申報之老友。抑亦中國報業史上之佳話矣。申報爲我國最先發行之報紙。此一價値。即將永佔中國報業史之首頁。故今日舉行六十週年紀念。其所含意義。實至偉大。蓋狹義言之。固爲申報一已之六十年紀念。而廣義言之。則又我中國自有報紙之六十年紀念也。有人牽强咐會。以爲木版印刷。有盛行於隋。已爲報紙開其先河。而昔之京報。尤爲今日報紙之濫觴。若謂申報不足稱創始也者。實則木版與京報。皆未與報紙發生直接關係。安能並爲一談。報紙係以鉛製活字排印。欲竊報紙之源。當攷究鉛字之由來。據我所知。中國之有鉛製活字。乃始於遜清嘉慶初年。爲東印度會社所造。但其後　　回祿之災。所造之字。悉付一炬。已而英美敎士來華傅敎。迻譯聖經。始復造鉛字。作印刷聖經之用。於是歷若干年乃有申報出世。以至於今。鉛字之爲用愈廣。報紙亦愈多。試思若無鉛字。報紙又寗能以木板印刷耶。</p>
<p>雖然。上述乃鉛製活字之先於申報耳。以言報紙。則固申報爲中國首創第一。今値自由談發行六十年紀念刋。爰書此以爲賀。並代申報徴求老友。今日果有壽逾七八十。曾自申報第一號起。綿亘不間。閲覽至今。而其人尙健在。猶逐日閲覽者。曷不寓書申報。我知申報必竭誠歡迎其人也。</p>
<h3>不可思議三則細柳</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>國民黨以黨治國。一黨專政。小百姓也揰不上檔。此種政府。應該呌做『國民黨政府』或簡稱爲『黨政府』那才名副其實。然而現在所稱呼的。偏偏是『國民政府』。不讓國民問政。但‘</p>
<p>要用他做一個招牌。這是什麽邏輯？令人不可思議。</p>
<p>國難當前。庫空如洗。國家窮到極點。所以各機關一律减人停薪僅發生活費。有時連生活費亦領不到小。職員一家數口。不數事蓄。呌若連天。生不如死。因爲是國家蒙難。所以忍痛挨若敢嘆而不敢言。誰知道。政府對於黨國偉人。却不如此刻薄。送給川資旅費。起碼兩五十萬不等。最近錢且碰人家一個大釘子。何以厚於此而薄於彼這是什麽經濟原理？令人不可思議一個有手段而又漂亮的女子。越不許男子前來接近。偶爾男子前來。總不給以顔色。越使一般男子天天來追逐她。前仆後繼。百折不磨喝西北風。受單戀的若。但是自已並不覺得。這是什麽吸力？令人不可思議。</p>
<h3>我於申報之感想</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>申報六十年紀念。瘦鵑來函索稿。我因有病。以致躭誤限期。但是我對申報的感情可。以説得是從小至今與。日俱深的了我。在四十年前就做。些詩詞刋。在附張上得。到的贈品都是聚珍板印的書我。那時節尙在家塾中讀書但。是先生敎我讀的書我。總不喜歡讀。我却喜歡讀申報及。申報所贈的書當。時附張專。刋些小品文字因。此我在當時也就朝薫夕染的受。着陶　。成就了一個詩人詞客的頭銜而。用我很羡慕主筆先生的權力能。言人所不敢言的國家大事。以爲憂官直誎猶有許多顧忌不。敢盡所欲言。獨諱。因此我的敎先生常。常對我們説友。直友諒友多報。則此三益俱備將。來讀書上進做了御史大夫就。該和主筆先生一様知。無不言。言無不盡。A是個當行的直道不。可因直道難行而遂不行所。以我在弱冠的時候就被申報的　陶不。拘對什麽人什。麽事都把一佃個直字做了前提奉。爲心法及。至我的先生眞。個做了御史　爲彈劾權要鍛羽而歸我。很替他大抱不平做。了一篇文字到申報去不。見刋載而。民時科舉停廢不。但言路已塞而。進身之階亦。遂無望。因此我的别號改署了很有許多爲我輩能力所不及改造的。惟有在小説上可。以任意施行。不受什麽拘束想。到那様就那様絕。不許容别人屬入一些意見可。謂無上的權能。比天公還要增進些。於是我就專做小説而在這一個時代報。紙上的譯著小説日。出不窮灌輸們「班青年的知識也。就換了」個境界。所以我在三十歲以前的良師益友屈。指算來只有兩個「。個便是申報」。個要算格致滙報了。從前這兩種報都。是用中國紙印的後。來新聞報用了有光紙印。申報也就改了直。到那一年始改雙面印的報紙我。就糢糊了不。過我有一種感想覺。得時勢的戀遷報。紙的誘掖權能。實在有易俗轉風的極大力量彷。彿和磁石一般。任何頑鐵一經接觸。他就能够吸引别一個的頑鐵過來。便他有一個定向。不致游移。這一種的無上權能小説家就望塵莫及。因爲看小説的不過是少數人。而看報的人。往往以一傅十以十傅百·一言興邦。是很容易的一回事。向來有句笑話説主筆先生的一枝笨抵。得三千毛瑟。而在現今的國防上説。比之十萬飛機。還要勝過百倍。因爲每一張報紙風行出去。瞬息千里。萬口宣傅。他的權力。並不必要强制人的。只要一語破的是醒了人。人人自會點頭贊歎。盡力奉行同向一條直道上走去。就不致於誤入迷途。你想這一種的恩物和利器。在人間世上。除了報紙以外。還有别的及得上囑。而况申報是六十年來。言必有中。四萬萬人至少有兩萬萬人信仰着他。任何報紙所載的消息。所主張的策論。一經傅播人口。總説是申報上這様説呢。萬一那消息是不確的。那主張是不對的。就有人説。到底是申報不曾這様説過呢。所以申報對於民衆的地位。凡有指導。就彷彿是父詔其子。兄詔其弟。而在民衆對於申報。其識見雖因年歲而異。但是就申報的年歲而論則。六十耆指使。實在可以算得一位耆老而。有頣指氣使的可能古語説。年長以倍。則父事之。十年以長。則兄事之。五年以長則肩隨之。所以我想一般民衆對於申報的信仰觀念。也都如是。現在三千瑟。已歸無用。十萬飛機。猝難辦到。固我國防惟。賴衆志成城。以求逹於旣富且强的目的。就我的愚見。最容易見效的。就是提倡國貨。使得我國人人人有一恒業。人人能有一個恒心。成就他的一種恒產。那就不致於有失業的恐慌不。致於有喪心病狂的現象而。共產的企圖也。就不致於搖動人心。所以我對申報的願望很。願他實行其耆指使的力量快。把報紙來換了中國報紙。紙價雖貴。但是　賤傷農正。同此例儘。可把廣告費改做累進法因。而减少些資本家的侵略也好即。使售價改作九分。不過在知識階級上多。費一元一月而已求。知識的人們决。不吝此區區就。是敎科書亦何　不可如此因。爲讀書報的人决。不會因貪其廉而始購讀如。果以爲價廉物美而不得不用外貨那。末富强二字也。只好拱讓外人來專美的了我。早想貢獻這點意見因。爲好像是失時之鳴現。在覺得失業的人愈加多了江。浙閩贛的紙槽已。經閉歇了許多把。很好的竹料廢。棄於地無。人收買。而在造紙廠方面以爲非用不可不。能製造報紙這。一種的現象實。在是很危險的農。工失業。至於無事可爲。自然造成了虎兕出柙　玉毁於　中的趨勢再。過六十年後。不知我國四萬萬人。如何存活。恐怕早已做了亡國奴專。替外國人去做牛馬了呢。</p>

<p>殖民之治與閉關之治</p>
<p>西洋的開疆拓土</p>
<p>閉關思想的中國皇帝思想的中國</p>
<p>没命的逃和上海的繁榮</p>
<p>有了民治就没有漢奸</p>
<p>生平三件恨事</p>
<p>閉關思想</p>
<p>閉關思想害殺了老百姓</p>
<p>八萬萬只手</p>
<p>輪船「孔夫子」</p>
<p>吾的記性差了吾實在不能再做有系統的叙述了。啊呀！眞是一夢…吾是在咸豐元年到上海的。那時在吴淞口所看見的外國兵船十條倒有九條是帆船時人相傅道光初年間就有西洋火輪運糧米到北京這是不確的吾看見的第一隻輪船是海關上騐關用的船史Cocfueius「孔夫子」可見當時洋人還很敬重中國的文化那時的火輪都是「明輪而不是暗輪」。</p>
<p>招商局和美國旗</p>
<p>講到輪船就是想起招商局了大。約緒九年的時候因爲安南的事情引起了中法的戰爭凉山之役事前李鴻章得了信曉得法國兵船要封銷長江使招商的船没法通過所以就和我們老在三眉叔是招商局的總辦他奉了李鴻章的命去和其昌洋行商量。其昌洋行的美國人是和老三是朋友所以肯答應他掛美國旗那。時外邊謠言都是説招商已經出賣給美國人其實這是李鴻章的急智當時寫了兩張合同一張是明的一張是暗的明合同説是出賣暗合同説是請求懸旗合。同簽後後三天就開戰招商的船掛了美國旗終算可以自由那時中國的海防一些都没有直到大禍臨頭還要臨時求掛外國旗來保護自已這是多麽可恥的事後。來招商局還是吾代表眉叔到天津去收回的那。時盛杏孫要收回其昌洋行史密特不肯他説當時接洽的前途旣是馬某現在收回交涉也應是馬某。所以吾代表了眉叔當了李中堂的面和史密特談判一個大錢也不花居然拿招商局收回了。當時謠言説是馬某發了六千萬的大財其實招商局虧空逹一千二百餘萬兩都是一篇爛賬啊！</p>
<p>輪船上的押櫃</p>
<p>招商局最大的壤處就是船上的僱員從買辦到茶房都没有薪水他。們非但没者薪水還要出押櫃。局裏要買辦出押櫃買辦要茶房出押櫃茶房要水手出押櫃。這様重重的剥削結果苦的還是乘客。所以買辦走一次長江賺二三千兩銀子是不算什麽希奇客人可以多報少酒錢貴得不像様子局。裏省去一筆薪水隨你去偷去搶一。切可不管。</p>
<p>做官的報銷</p>
<p>咳！這是中國民族的劣根性人民如此官吏更不必説當時上海道台。祇消每年報銷朝庭五萬兩銀子此外隨多隨少都進道台的腰包這。，種包工式的政治是中國政治的特色那。時一個州縣限这定必須報銷若干拿不出來要賠拿出以後其餘一切都是他的好處所。以老百姓都窮惟有做官可以發財做官發財還有一件妙計就是報荒祇。消年頭差些就向上峯報荒上面就可准减幾成田賦於是已經收進而没有扣减的多頭都入了他的朌包。</p>
<p>康聖人的嫖債</p>
<p>從招商想到康有爲倒有一件很有趣的故事原。來康聖人在光緒初年嫖得一榻糊塗那。時須趕赴京下春闈最後才搭上了招商輪船他。的嫖賬都没有還債主都追到船上來索債康聖人情急智生躲在船頂上的救命船裏居然得以賴過債這是康聖人的玩意兒足見文人都不修邊幅其實康有爲還不及梁啓超康。得名於「僞經考」其實是從方望溪那裏愉來的。</p>
<p>紅頭和城裏</p>
<p>吾從咸豐元年冬天到上海以來已有八十二年二。年到南京去鄉試出榜時候因洪羊之役京中已經鬧紛紛三。年八月紅頭鬧事不。久占了上海五。年二月紅頭退出八年川沙南匯失守南翔寳山上海均被「紅頭」所占那時龍華的旗人向上海城内開砲城裏的「紅頭」也向城外開砲那。時上海城裏熱閙非凡大。東門一帶的商店都是金壁輝煌一。進小東門就有一家帽莊呌做「陸正大」是很出名的吾還買過一頂帽子廣。東會館和天妃宮都在小東門外面那時董家渡的天主敎堂還没有造好咧。</p>
<p>上海繁榮之開端</p>
<p>洪羊亂時蘇州閻門外滸墅關一帶壩岸的石頭都被江北人撤光買給上海人造房子吾。初來上海的時候一。間洋房都没有一條馬路都没有領事館都在一所房子裏呌做「二十四間」地點在現時天妃宮橋堍上。海的發展是。吾一天一天看牠起來的當。時祇有四馬路。六馬路造了又壊虹口還没有興大。馬路祇到泥城橋光初年還很荒凉最。熱閙的中心是在四馬路地。價每畝至多八百塊錢三。樓三底的房租祇値十二塊興。聖街原是吾家的產業房租六塊錢一幢利息已經算很厚那。時一隻元寳（値七十五元）可造一樓一披租。界上祇有「公會」還没有巡捕房巡捕很少保險事業還没有興辦旣没有房險更没有船險講。到上海交通的工具先有馬車後有東洋車那時馬車還很少而且都是私家自備的。</p>
<p>上海的鐵路</p>
<p>上海辦鐵路大約在光緒初年首先造的是上海到吴淞的那一條那時劉銘傑奏辦鐵路那奏章還是吾做的後。來朝庭下諭説是火車行時一路有電風西洋地廣人稀還不礙事在中國地狹人稠沿鐵路五六十里的房屋都可被火車風吹倒年以沿鐵路五六十里地方都要歸入鐵路區域後。來德國人在山東造鐵路籍口鐵路區域竟將沿鐵路的礦山都占據了所。以外國人侵占中國人的權利大半是由我們自已糊裏糊塗斷送的直。到現在東三省日本借端保護南滿鐵路區域駐了兵還不算現在已經佔據東北的全部了。</p>
<p>上海的電報</p>
<p>電報之設最初由其昌洋行經辦從金利源棧房到英租界一路均立電桿。那時吾弟眉叔條呈電報章程招股辦理盛。杏孫做總辦開。辦費由國家認電桿費由招商認盛。杏孫自已所認股了都是口頭上説的乾股所以盛杏孫發財其所得大半得諸於公還不算得諸於民比。較現在一般官僚死不要臉的直接向百姓頭上剥削的已經勝一籌了。</p>
<p>立電桿發財妙法</p>
<p>説起電報就想到電桿電報局的職員可以借立電桿的名目來做發財的方法。當時人民都很米信以爲門口立了電桿就要壊人家風不於。是電報局裏的人有意在百姓人家的門口立電桿百姓有的討厭有的怕壊風水就不得不向電報局疏通説情於是局裏的人和百姓討價還價賄賂公行這就是當時百姓怨恨盛杏孫的根源啊。</p>
<p>會審公堂</p>
<p>講到會審公堂是創於同治初年的那。時上海道台想偷懶願意和外國領事分。到後來外國領事反處於主審地位中國官員到處於會審的地位竟在光緒二十八年和外國公使訂了合同承認外國領事在租界上有審判中國人的法權。從此中國的陪審官更降而與華洋通事的地位相等這。一點要怪曾國藩的不通。光緒三十一年爲了黎黄氏一案華洋通事被領事条把掌莧至激起人民公憤罷市吾也着實爲了會審官大抱不平中。國人向來不懂外交不諳洋務其實曾國藩辦洋務遠不及李鴻章至林則徐不過心好一些也是不十分懂得洋務的。禁買鴉片一事他祇知道和英國商人閙而不想直接和英國政府交涉後來引起戰爭也祇可以説是和英國商人開戰。</p>
<p>鴉片的故事]</p>
<p>説起鴉片光緒初年也曾開始禁過當。時李鴻章派吾弟眉叔到印度去交涉印度政府答應每年遞减出口中。國每年增加税則規定鴉片都運給官賣後。來中國嫌官賣不好意思就轉托海關洋人代辦結果祗實行半年就無形停止。原因英國派人以中國來調查説是中國自已没有滅種啊！總之中國人明明理直氣壯的事一到後來終是烟消雲散毫無結果。</p>
<p>申報是吾的老弟</p>
<p>時間過得正快申報也有六十年了比申報還早的有京報吾自已足足保存了二十多年不幸徐家匯圖書館的職員不識貨認做廢紙一把火燒了申報雖到花甲還是吾的老弟這六十年來上海的情形算是滄海桑地國事更是糟不可言這。六十年來申報所記的那一件事不是令人傷心拿。現在上海的繁華來和六十年前一比表面自然是很進步骨子裏何嘗有一些兒進步。拿我們拉拉雜雜所説的幾件事來説吧航。業辦得怎様鐵路辦得憄様電報貪官污吏比起從前更是無法天鴉。片鬼比從前更多上。海在骨子裏祇有退步没有進步其。實上海表面上的繁榮是根據什麽原因呢</p>
<p>殖民之治與閉關之治</p>
<p>吾嘗暗暗的想爲什麽中國人處處不及外國人爲什麽外國强中國弱吾終於想像其間並没有什麽神秘的原因原。來中國和西洋不同的地方祇有一點。就是中國的政治是閉關政治西洋的政治是殖民政治因。爲中國的政治的政治是閉關政治所以皇帝不許人民有一些兒國家思想直到現在連黨政府不許人民干涉政治国因。爲中國是閉關政治所以一般人祇知道把結一個皇帝其他一切都一概不問直到現在一般政客還是充滿着皇帝思想祗知道爭無上的權柄。中國的文臣是不知有文章的他們對皇帝的奏章都是一番恭維得非常肉麻的話頭直到現在還是要拿一個人的意見當做天經地義來厭服人家。</p>
<p>西洋的開疆拓土</p>
<p>西洋人不然他們受了宗敎的影響知道人類在造物主的面前是一律平等的他。們知道政治就是他們自已切身的事他們老早就有開疆拓土的精神西。班牙去訪美洲葡萄牙到遠東澳門給葡萄牙得了去連中國自已也不知道後來得了以後和葡萄牙商量好容易才答應年納五百兩銀子做租費現在連這五百兩的名目都取消了光。緒初年失威海衛當時山東衙門裏連地圖都没有更不知道威海衛在那裏好容易吾在一敎當裏找到一本小小的地圖才發現威海衛之所在。</p>
<p>閉關思想的中國皇帝思想的中國。</p>
<p>西洋是殖民之治所以他們至少限度就。有保守國土的觀念中國是閉關之治所以人民不但没有國家思想更没有愛護國土的觀念人。民○知道種田完糧給皇帝而皇帝也祗知道窮奢極欲享他一人的天下中。國根本没有殖民的觀念所以中國人得了南洋許多地方一做頭目就要蓋起三宮六院擺出皇帝架子以致華僑不得不伸手投向外國人懷裏去求保護做。了小小一個疏球王也要享三宮六院的威福疏球終於滅亡現。在不知道多多少少貪官污吏都是官氣十足無非是皇帝架子的縮影其。實日本也是這様不。過日本人善於模仿他們學到西洋一些殖民政治的氣味就想到中國來诫騐日。本人的智識並不怎様高明吾。很不服氣不過他們對小事倒很認眞這他們的好處吾到日本去的時候是在光緒初年吾們已經割了台灣給牠那時日本的新學堂很少吾親眼看見花旗人陪了日本親王到歐美遊歷吾。在日本華僑對吾説日本視華人如高僧小兒得撫華人之手就有宏福日本人看到中國的官吏和士大夫更是恭敬非凡現。在怎様現在日本人已經公開的駡我們是「無組織的國家」拿我們當生番一様看待其。實日本人○學得一些兒西洋皮毛他們遠不及外國外國打仗要備幾年糧草日本没有充分準備就想興兵動武日本眞是狂妄。</p>
<p>没有的逃和上海的繁榮</p>
<p>話回頭來中國政治是閉關政治所以人民只知道天下是皇帝一人的絕不知道土地是人民所以生且居更不知道愛護生居之原現。在皇帝是没有了然而閉關的流毒還是依舊存在中。國人愛護國土的觀念還是非常薄弱所。以一有外患就想棄土而逃絕無守土而抗的思想中。國人○知道没命的逃内戰時没命的逃到上海外患時也没命的逃到上海於是上海就一天一天發展起來上海的繁榮就是西洋殖民之治和中國閉關之治激漡冲積的結品晶一。部上海的繁</p>
<p>榮史就是一部中國的傷心史。</p>
<p>有了民治就没有潢奸</p>
<p>吾在光緒十年到西洋去所經各國没有一國人民比中國再苦再窮的現。在中國的農民是更苦更窮了然。而提倡以農治國是不夠的必須積極的提倡殖民政治而殖民政治又須從民治做起必。須使人民知道政治是自已的事土地是自已的土地然後可以養成愛護國土的觀念有了民治然後可以没有漢奸。</p>
<p>生平三件恨事</p>
<p>吾生平有三件恨事都是牢不可破的閉關思想害我的。</p>
<p>第一件恨事就是高麗没有成中立國當。時日本恨俄國那時只要中俄兩國答應就可以實行可是朝廷依舊戀戀不捨於宗主國的地位所以朝廷方面一些也説不進當。時高麗每年進貢沿途地方官吏的招待要化到八十萬金直到大院群閙事以後還不肯。</p>
<p>第二件恨事就是同治十三年日本奪台灣中國不敢打吾幾次條呈劉省三不敢做那。時我們有四十條商船可以和台灣通商有二十條戰船以資保護日。本的力量遠不及我們而我們還是不敢這。種畏縮的精神一直流到現在就造成澈底的不抵抗主義。</p>
<p>第三件恨事就是没有開九龍爲自由因爲九龍一開爲自由埠貨物進出可以下納關税則對面的香港不久必倒吾。曾上條呈買十萬畝地開關商塲朝廷終是不睬</p>
<p>閉關思想害殺了老百姓</p>
<p>吾想來想去閉關思想害殺了我們老百姓政治上的不公開這是對内的閉關權利可以拱手讓人正當的往來却置之不顧這是對外的閉關臨。到危難的時候政府始終只知道玩一套以夷制夷的玩意兒吾。們要救中國就要先打破這閉關的思想從民治做起中。國的所謂「大家庭」其實是「小家庭」因爲中國人民祗知有家不知有鄉不知有縣不知有省更不知有國中。國要造成農工的大家庭用科學的精神來組織一番務使對内有響察對外有國防時時刻刻拿我們生且居的土地保護好。</p>
<p>八萬萬隻手</p>
<p>威廉第二年經時遊歷遠東到黄浦江望着上海歎道「這」個國家有四萬萬人民八萬萬只手一旦起來誰能抵制他」吾現在年紀雖高精神確不老依舊興高彩烈對着上海不由得不希望八萬萬只手快快舉起來伸到黄海外邊去</p>

<h3>替申報做壽</h3>
<p>— 牛郎</p>
<p>申報出版至今。恰届六週年。憑着它的年齡資格。照理自然應該給它做六秩大慶。大大的鋪張熱閙一下子了。可是當此國難聲中。一切崇尙節儉。所以祇是簡單的舉了一個儀式。猶之乎人們做小生日一般。請人吃兩碗壽麵。應個景兒羆了。</p>
<p>講到申報的年齡。像我們這些後生小子。對它稱呼起來。至少也該稱它一聲老伯。並且這位老伯。更是一個見多識廣經騐豐富的人。一年三百六十五日。無日不在諄諄善誨。指導我們人生的處世經絡。因此我們和它。也幾於是無日不親。所以在事實上。早不啻成了我們的良師益友了。</p>
<p>廻想起六十年來。也不知出版了幾千種的報紙。可是十九都不幸少年天逝。像這種有悠久歷史的申報眞可謂是魯殿靈光巍然獨存了。我想申報於這慶祝聲中。一定要回首滄桑。自歡亦復自豪呢。</p>
<p>區區不才。後生小子。與申報結識墨緣。轉眼也有十年之久了。不過一個人的本身。是愈老愈衰。而報紙的本身。却愈老愈壯。吾知再過數十年後。人類是逃不了新陳代謝。而報紙的精神。將愈見其日日新又日新的發展到無量盡之境。</p>
<p>其實。話又要説回來了。我們中國的報紙。畢竟還在幼稚時代。即如像申報這様資格最老銷路最大的報紙。日銷還不滿二十萬份。與歐美那種日出百餘萬份的比起來。固然差得很遠。就是和</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>那區區执桑三島的朝日新聞相擬。也不免恥居人下咧。如此説來。申報又安可不挺起精神。再努力地去奮鬭呢。老申啊老申。趕緊地努力吧。</p>
<p>一鳞一爪</p>
<h3>申翁朗的壽辰</h3>
<p>— 尤緣萍</p>
<p>一個清朗的上午，白銀色的陽光透過了紗窗，疎散的樹影眏射到窗上，形成了一幅美妙的晝圖。華兒的母親在很勿忙的搜尋着什物，沙發上還亂堆着些出門的服裝。</p>
<p>「華，快些起來吧，今天是申老伯伯的壽辰，起來準備着前去拜壽。」他的母親喊着。</p>
<p>華揉了揉眼睛坐了起來，面上籠罩着笑容在他的笑空裏，象徴着這可欣喜的慶賀的日期業已到臨。　　××路轉角上高塔着彩牌染了色的燈泡在牌架上搖曳着反射出點點的閃光，車輛在很有秩序的推列着進出的賀客都籌掛着喜氣。</p>
<p>雖則是賓客如此的衆多，但，他却因此更引起他的興高，更誠懇而和靈的與賓客們周旋。固然，他是整六旬了整六旬約大慶了但，以他的健壯望去似乎仍在壯年時期，不過他的健壯雖像壯年可是，他的幹練與聲望却隨着他往日的勤苦與高齡一年年的增加起來，一年年的宏大起來。</p>
<p>漸漸地來賓更多了，因之申翁周旋的繁忙與來賓的多寡成了正比例，有時忙　得竟使他不能停足。</p>
<p>太陽將落的時候眞快，瞬時間由夕陽而餘輝，後來連餘輝也都隱匿了，所頂代的是那巨量的燈光烘耀在堂前的各部，在巨量燈光的烘耀之下，喧囂的説笑在陪襯着光映。</p>
<p>晚飯過了，大部的來賓陸續的回去了，僅有些至近的親族不肯驟然的離開了這不可多遇的盛會，仍繼續的在那裏隨便的譚着，笑着。</p>
<p>夜色的幕帷襲攏了來，時鐘上指示着夜已漸漸地深了於是，在不肯驟然離别的親族，也不得不退了出來，當他們退出來的時候，在彩色電燈的映射之下還望見申翁的健影浴在紅紫交侵的彩，色中。</p>
<p>東西南北</p>
<h3>花甲之年</h3>
<p>— 烟影</p>
<p>「唉！我怎麽會看見這様的殘酷的屠殺啊！」一位壯健的老者説。</p>
<p>這位老者今年的年歲是剛滿花甲，他曾經身歷許多戀亂，在他居住的這個村莊上時常可以看到發生凶猛的爭執。然而，最恥辱的，最痛心的却無過於這一次受别個村莊上的人的欺侮了，這種欺侮是最殘酷的，最凶暴的，殺人放火比任何野蠻的民族任何惡魔都殘暴。</p>
<p>他是個公正嚴明的人，全村人民都默許他可以指導他們，帮助他們的，無論什麽事情。他也自信曾費了很多的精神，很多的心血在全村的利益發展之中。</p>
<p>「如果本村的有權威者大家都把生命付託自身的事業的話，如果他們絕對不閙意見都肯和衷共濟的話，本村的現像何致於敗落到這麽様？」他眞悲憤極了，他想到因爲自相爭殺所造成的衰弱，常常是這様的告訴人。在平時他的　　原很鋭利，他的意志原很遠大對於這様的忠告這様的熱忱不知曾經發表過多少次了，雖然有些人都不能像他説的那様去幹。</p>
<p>可是他絲毫不絕望，絲毫不灰心，你們看　不是更起勁地在大聲疾呼嗎？他願全村人融爲一個整個的心體，準備　　　努力向前，去殺退我們的敵人。他知道自已的六十年過程，僅僅是生　中的一小段以後的時期將更長久於過去的數倍數十倍數百倍………當然他不會變更他的抱負依舊和村人共同奮進，創造那光榮的時代！</p>
<p>唉！</p>
<h3>母親的願望</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>這個嬰孩的母親，從昨天起便開始成爲乞丐了。</p>
<p>在這個不十分熱閙的街上，她緊緊地靠着這高的圍牆坐着。她的臉色又黄又瘦，眼睛深深地陷下，完全褪脱了一般年輕。女人應有的顔色。由於她這苦惱的面容，你可知道她現在只感覺無限的空虚，甚至於認定人類的生命已是走到末的了。現在她本身的一切都已完結，剩下只有這不可忍受的飢餓，最後的眼淚最後的呼吸，以及下身的疼痛和懷中因飢餓而乾　的嬰孩。</p>
<p>這新生未久的小生命，簡直是無休止的發出微弱的哭聲，母親雖然再小心將下埀而無乳汁的乳房塞進他的小口中去，然而還是失望的哭泣。由於這可厭的哭泣更使她增添苦惱，甚至願意將一切的怨恨都堆到這嬰孩的命運中去，因爲這小孩兒的降生便引來了這災難的到臨。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>大概是一個多月以前，這個小孩子剛剛生下的時候她便聽到閘北自已家裏附近響着密接的槍聲，於是她只得驚惶失措的血液模糊的睡在地板上。第二天第三天一直繼續下去，一點也没有停止戰爭的希望，只有扯着碼頭工人的丈夫相對哭泣。一個禮拜以後，自已的丈夫爲了家裏没有糧食不得不偷偷的瞞着她跑了出去，可是到晚上還不見回來，一直都不曾回來，於是她除了終日哭泣以外覺得自已的生命已去了一大半了。幾天以後的一個上午，一羣帶着鋼盔的兵搥破了她的房門闖了進來，强有力將她按住而且褪下了她的下衣，於是她在。一種不能忍受的疼痛中情願立時死去。大約是兩小時以後，她清醒過來時屋内仍是剩着自已和新生嬰孩，可是下身已是血流如注。這時候她本可以自殺，然而爲了還要等候她的丈夫或是爲了他而留下這丈夫的一塊肉，於是她還是不能死去並且一直留到現在。……</p>

<h3>The National Crisis of the Past Sixty Years</h3>
<p>(1) This newspaper began publication in the 11th year of the Tongzhi reign (1872 in the Western calendar), precisely sixty years ago today. Looking back to the time of this newspaper's inception, it was a period of internal turmoil following the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion and external distress after the Opium War and the invasion by the Anglo-French Allied Forces. The nation's power was declining daily, and the people's livelihood was becoming increasingly impoverished. Now, we are again suffering from internal floods and external pressure from strong neighbors. The upheavals of September 18th and January 28th are no less than wounds to our very survival, a matter of life and death hanging by a thread. Over the past sixty years, things have only worsened. If what we suffer today is called a "national crisis," then virtually every day of these sixty years has been a "national crisis." This newspaper over the past sixty years can be said to be a "true record of national crisis," a "diary of chaos and disaster" woven with layers of lash marks, blood, and tears. Alas, for sixty years, worries and calamities have surrounded us, and we have been on the verge of collapse again and again. Yet, our nation has remained deeply asleep, never awakening, repeatedly missing the opportunity to strengthen itself. Looking back, it is truly sigh-inducing and leaves us with a feeling of deep regret. Today, we have reached the final line of life and death. Will our nation ultimately remain a sleeping lion in a deep slumber, awaiting slaughter? Or will it rise up with vigor and embark on the open path of self-sacrifice and rebirth? On this sixtieth anniversary of the newspaper, we have excerpted the national crises of the past sixty years to alert the people and serve as a warning to them.</p>
<p>(2) In modern times, our country has been increasingly subjected to the invasion and subjugation by the great powers. Tracing its origins, it should be dated back to the Opium War of 1840 as the starting point. The Opium War was inherently a necessary demand of the times. After the Industrial Revolution, Western countries experienced an accelerating surge in productivity and an accelerating accumulation of capital. Inevitably, this led to competition for markets and investment sites. Africa had already been completely divided, and South America had no space left to intervene. Only China, with its vast territory and abundant resources, held, at the height of the Qing Dynasty, extensive dependencies stretching east to the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, west across the Pamir Mountains to Kokand, north to Kyakhta, south to the Gulf of Thailand and the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean, northwest to Lake Balkhash and the Kazakh and Bukhara regions, and southeast to Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. However, standing in the Pacific Ocean, calling itself the Central Kingdom, and viewing other peoples as barbarians, its culture was declining, and its economy remained stuck in the stage of agricultural and small-scale handicraft economy. It was coveted by the advanced capitalist powers. However, at that time, the strength of this ancient nation was not yet fully understood, and they did not dare to easily knock on the door with military force. In the Opium War, Britain, with 15,000 soldiers and 26 warships, marched straight in, captured Dinghai, blockaded Ningbo, and advanced on Tianjin. They then attacked Fujian and Zhejiang, successively capturing Xiamen, Dinghai, Ningbo, Zhapu, Baoshan, and Shanghai, and advanced toward Nanjing. Finally, the Treaty of Nanjing was signed, ceding Hong Kong, opening treaty ports, and paying war reparations, initiating the era of unequal treaties. The great powers then realized that the vast China was extremely vulnerable. Consequently, France and the United States came to demand similar concessions, and the Sino-French Treaty and the Sino-American Treaty were successively signed. The establishment of concessions, the concession of jurisdiction, the customs duty of five percent ad valorem, and the stipulation of the most-favored-nation clause – in other words, the foundation for Western European advanced capitalist countries to invade our country was established with this war. From then on, the capitalist powers regarded our country as an investment site, a market for goods, and a source of raw materials. The mutual trade of the past was transformed into a one-sided invasion.</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the economic power of industrialized countries, our backward agricultural economy underwent significant changes, and the people's anti-imperialist movement flourished. In addition, the original peasant uprisings of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the so-called "Nian Rebellion" broke out successively, starting with the great upheaval in western Guangdong in 1847. These disturbances lasted for ten years, traversing more than ten provinces, before they were suppressed. By then, the national economy and the people's livelihood had suffered extremely heavy damage.</p>
<p>In 1857, due to the resistance of the people of Guangdong against the British, the Anglo-French Allied Forces again captured Guangzhou. In 1858, the Anglo-French-American-Russian Allied Forces captured Dagu and advanced on Tianjin, forcing the signing of the Treaty of Tianjin. In 1860, the Anglo-French Allied Forces marched into Beijing and burned the Old Summer Palace, establishing the validity of the Treaty of Tianjin. Tsarist Russia took the opportunity to demand the signing of the Sino-Russian Treaty of Beijing. As a result, our country's doors were completely opened, and its territorial and administrative sovereignty was increasingly fragmented and incomplete. Its status as a semi-colony was increasingly solidified. Looking back on the past, although the eastward invasion by capitalist countries was an inevitable requirement of the era after the Industrial Revolution, in other words, the industrial economy was bound to break down the barriers of the agricultural economy and demand its industrialization, the Qing court failed to recognize the trend of the world, stubbornly clinging to its old ways, acting arrogantly, and indulging in luxury and debauchery, relying on the people to consolidate its rule, causing cultural stagnation and economic backwardness, which was also its greatest root cause.</p>
<p>(3) We have already understood that the Opium War was the starting point of our country's "national crisis," in other words, the starting point of capitalist imperialism's economic and political invasion. Now, let us return to the most recent sixty years.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned that the most recent sixty years began in 1872, the 11th year of the Qing Tongzhi reign. Here, we must specifically point out that at that time, Western capitalist countries were flourishing, while Japan, with the Meiji Restoration of 1868, had embarked on the path of capitalism. The main reasons for Japan's restoration were the invasion of Western imperialism, with the American Black Ships first breaking down its doors, and the subsequent coercion by Britain and France to sign unequal treaties. On the other hand, the defeat of our country in the Opium War made them fearful of the power of Western imperialist powers, forcing them to rise up and restore themselves in order to survive. After the restoration, the court and the people were united, politics were enlightened, unequal treaties were abolished to seek national independence and freedom, Western culture was imitated, and industries were developed, following in the footsteps of Western capitalist advanced countries. As a result, national power grew daily, and it became a new nation in East Asia. The result of the Opium War failed to awaken our countrymen from their deep slumber and failed to invigorate our nation, while Japan was saved as a result and rose up to strengthen itself, gradually becoming a major threat to our country. This is due to the drunken stupor and complacency of our nation, which is what we should recognize today.</p>
<p>Japan, a poor and weak island nation, was once transformed by restoration into a capitalist country built on light industry. Its inherent foundation was weak, and its subsequent development was also flawed, so it immediately showed a fierce and cruel face. After the restoration, looking around, Western Europe was already out of reach, and South America had no room to intervene. Only neighboring China had not yet been formally divided by Western European capitalist advanced countries, and it was inevitable that it would target our country for invasion. Japan's first move to invade us was to follow in the footsteps of Western European powers and demand formal trade with us. In 1871, it concluded a treaty of commerce with us, consisting of eighteen articles. The treaty was revised in 1872. In 1873, France invaded Annam, captured Hanoi, and forced the signing of the Franco-Vietnamese Treaty of Friendship. The following year, Japan also, under the pretext of the killing of Japanese merchants by Taiwanese aborigines, sent Saigo Takamori to attack the aboriginal tribes, demanding 500,000 taels in compensation before withdrawing its troops. The borderlands were therefore full of troubles. In 1876, during the Guangxu reign, a British translator was killed by bandits in Yunnan. As a result of negotiations, we were forced to sign the Treaty of Yantai, opening Yichang, Wuhu, Wenzhou, and Beihai as treaty ports. In 1879, Japan suddenly annexed Ryukyu and renamed it Okinawa Prefecture, which was the first step in Japan's southward maritime policy. In 1884, when Napoleon III of France was emperor, he attacked Annam again, and China and France declared war. At first, there were defeats, but later, under the command of Liu Mingchuan and others, there were repeated victories, and the French general Courbet was killed. France felt quite embarrassed to advance or retreat. However, due to the ineptitude of the Qing court, which was ignorant of the national situation, it negotiated peace with France the following year, recognizing Annam as a French protectorate and opening Longzhou, Mengzi, and Manhao as treaty ports. As a result, Annam was no longer ours. In 1886, Britain annexed Burma, and Burma was lost. In 1888, Britain coveted Tibet again. In 1890, Britain forced the signing of the Sino-Indian Treaty of Tibet, consisting of eight articles. In 1892, the Sino-Indian Trade Regulations of Tibet, consisting of nine articles, were signed, opening Yatung as a treaty port. The following year, the Sino-Indian Trade and Pasture Treaty of Tibet, consisting of nine articles, was signed. From then on, the Tibetan border was clearly within the sphere of influence of Britain. Since the Opium War, the capitalist powers had shifted from coercing the opening of doors and selling goods to dividing colonies and establishing their own paths of advancement. However, at that time, Cixi held power in the Qing court, and national politics deteriorated daily. The ruler was foolish, and the ministers were mediocre, ignorant of the overall situation. Foreign troubles came one after another, and there was no way to defend against them. As a result, the tragic defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 during the Guangxu reign was the result. With this defeat, our international position plummeted and could never be restored.</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of our country had been planned day and night since the Meiji era, sparing no effort. Its so-called southward policy and northward policy were the two major routes of invasion. Having annexed Ryukyu, it then advanced north and coveted Korea. In 1894, it took advantage of the internal unrest in Korea to send troops to Korea and actively provoked conflict. The great powers all adopted a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, China and Japan, with years of accumulated resentment, formally declared war. In 1895, there were repeated defeats. The army retreated in disarray, and the navy was completely annihilated. Hushan, Jiulian, Andong, Fengcheng, Dadonggou, Dagushan, and Xiuyan all fell. The first important fortress in East Asia, Lushun, and Weihaiwei also fell into the hands of the Japanese. The northern and southern gateways to the Bohai Sea were occupied by the Japanese army. The entire Liaodong Peninsula also fell. The Japanese army further advanced south and coveted Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, intending to occupy them as naval bases in the South China Sea. This tragic defeat shocked the entire country. With the mediation of the United States, after much negotiation, Li Hongzhang, as the plenipotentiary representative, signed the most heartbreaking and infuriating Treaty of Shimonoseki with Japan in 1895, based on Japan's minimum requirements. The most important provisions were the recognition of the independence and autonomy of Korea, the cession of the southern part of Fengtian, the islands belonging to Fengtian on the eastern shore of Liaodong Bay and the northern shore of the Yellow Sea, the entire island of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, compensation of 200 million taels of military expenses, and the acquisition of navigation rights in our country's inland waterways. As a result, Korea, Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the entire Liaodong Peninsula were all practically under Japanese control.</p>
<p>After this war, our international status plummeted even further. For forty years, our country fell into the tragic state of being trampled on and controlled by the great powers, unable to stand on its own. This war was the key to this situation. The reasons for this defeat were that we could not grasp the international situation externally and could not understand Japan's national conditions. Internally, we could not be of one heart and mind and work together harmoniously. The eastern borders were defended separately, and powerful ministers hampered the court. There was no early decision on whether to fight or make peace. After the war began, there was no national mobilization to prepare for a long and arduous struggle. One defeat led to a hasty negotiation for peace. The result of this war was beyond the expectations of not only the European and American countries but also the Japanese. Europeans commented that this war was not a war between China and Japan but a war between Zhili Province and Japan. It was not a war between Zhili Province and Japan but a war between Li Hongzhang personally and Japan. Alas, how could a nation as scattered as sand defeat a nation as cohesive as a new community? Past events should not be forgotten; they are lessons for the future. But what is the situation today? Japan gained a great deal from the Sino-Japanese War, especially the lease of the Liaodong Peninsula, which was coveted by Tsarist Russia. As a result, Germany, France, and Russia jointly intervened to force Japan to return Liaodong. Although Liaodong was returned to our country in name as a result of the intervention of the three countries, this led to the loss of good coastal ports and various sovereign rights in the interior. In 1897, Germany, under the pretext of the Caozhou Religious Incident in Shandong, sent warships into Jiaozhou Bay and occupied the Qingdao forts, forcing the signing of a lease treaty. In 1898, Russia, under the pretext of Germany's occupation of Jiaozhou Bay, also sent warships into Lushun and then, under the pretext of defending against foreign invasions of Manchuria, demanded the lease of Lushun and Dalian and the construction of a railway from Harbin to Lushun, forcing us to formally sign a treaty. We redeemed the Liaodong Peninsula from the Japanese with 30 million taels, but now we offered it to Russia with both hands, and the entirety of Manchuria became Russia's sphere of influence. As for France, after occupying Annam, it focused on managing our southern provinces. In 1897, it also demanded that we not cede Hainan Island to other countries and that we extend the Longzhou Railway and exploit the mines of Guangdong and Guangxi Yunnan, and repair the commercial railway between Mengzi and Vietnam. The following year, with Germany leasing Jiaozhou Bay and Russia leasing Lushun and Dalian, Britain demanded that the Yangtze River basin not be ceded to other countries, and Japan demanded that Fujian not be ceded to other countries. They also used the pretext of "balance of power" to demand the lease of Guangzhou Bay for ninety-nine years and that the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan not be ceded to other countries. In 1899, two French officers and a missionary were killed near Guangzhou Bay. France sent warships directly into the bay, forcing us to sign the Guangzhou Bay Lease Treaty, with a lease term of ninety-nine years. In 1898, Britain also forced us to recognize the lease of Weihaiwei and then, with France leasing Guangzhou Bay, demanded the lease of Kowloon as a countermeasure. The Kowloon Lease Treaty was also signed in the same year.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the defeat of 1894, unreasonable demands from the great powers came one after another. Within a few years, good coastal ports fell into the hands of others, allowing the countries to establish their invasion bases and clearly divide their spheres of influence to prepare for the partition. Sovereignty was lost daily, and territory shrank daily. This period was the most dangerous period for our country. The reason why it did not perish was only due to the balance of power among the great powers. Although the storm clouds of competition in the Far East grew tighter daily, the conflicts between the international capitalist imperialist powers grew more urgent. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 can be said to be a life-threatening trauma to our nation and a dividing line in the era.</p>
<p>During this period, the Qing Dezong Emperor, seeing the frequent foreign invasions and the daily decline of national power, feared that the country would perish at any moment and had the intention of rising up and strengthening the country. In 1898, with the support of Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and others, he advocated reform and implemented a new policy. However, Cixi insisted on maintaining the old ways and opposed the new policy, arresting Kang and Liang, killing Yang Shenxiu and six others, and restricting the Dezong Emperor, preventing him from realizing his ambitions. The government returned to its old ways, bribery was rampant, eunuchs were favored, petty officials were appointed, morale was crushed, and the rights of the people were trampled on. As a result, a glimmer of hope was extinguished, and the national power declined daily. However, the failure of the reform was also due to the backwardness of our country's economy at that time, with the feudal economy still deeply rooted and the capitalist economy not yet sprouting. Therefore, there was ultimately no way to defeat the feudal forces and embark on the path of reform. This was due to the background of the times and not solely due to Cixi's obstruction.</p>
<p>(4) Due to the stimulation of foreign troubles and the fear of extinction, the hatred of the people for foreign races also grew secretly and deepened daily, waiting for an opportunity to erupt into anti-foreign actions. In 1898, the Yihetuan, a branch of the Bailian Sect, rose in Shandong, using the slogan of expelling foreigners. With the superstitious support of Prince Duan and Gangyi, their power grew. They spread from Shandong to the entire province of Zhili, and the killing of foreign missionaries was frequently heard. In 1900, villagers in Yizhou, Zhili, were defeated in a lawsuit with Catholics. The Yihetuan took the opportunity to incite trouble, burning churches and killing more than sixty Catholics, destroying railways, and cutting off telegraph lines. The ministers of various countries in Beijing became alarmed and urgently summoned sailors from Britain, France, Russia, Germany, the United States, Japan, and Italy to Beijing to protect the embassies. Prince Duan then dismissed the ministers of war, Kuang Liao, and Heng, and replaced them with anti-foreign elements such as Qixiu and Xu Tong. He even ordered the anti-foreign Gansu Provincial Commander Dong Fuxiang's troops to be transferred to the capital to strengthen the Yihetuan's power. Before long, Dong's troops killed Sugiyama Akira, the secretary of the Japanese embassy. The Yihetuan also burned various churches inside and outside Beijing and the residences of foreigners. The government decided to protect the Yihetuan and refuse foreign troops to land. As a result, the Yihetuan became more emboldened and fearless and launched a widespread anti-foreign movement. The killing of foreigners and the burning of churches occurred almost everywhere in the northern regions.</p>
<p>With the anti-foreign movement rising, the embassies of various countries were also besieged. The Eight-Nation Alliance, composed of 2,500 troops from Britain, Russia, France, Germany, the United States, Japan, Italy, and Austria, set out from Tianjin for Beijing but was trapped between Langfang and Yangcun. Warships from various countries then gathered to attack the Dagu forts and captured them. Three days after the fall of Dagu, the German minister, Klemens von Ketteler, was assassinated. The war situation became increasingly urgent, and war was declared. Zhang Zhidong, Li Hongzhang, and others presented the pros and cons, but the court paid no attention. On June 13, 1900, the Allied Forces captured Tianjin. Before long, they also captured Yangcun and Tongzhou. Cixi and the Dezong Emperor fled in panic at night, wandering to Chang'an. The Allied Forces then entered Beijing on July 21, dividing the city into districts and carrying out large-scale looting. The essence of the capital and the treasures of thousands of years of history were looted. This was the second fall of our capital since 1872. At that time, the Russians took the opportunity to occupy the three northeastern provinces and forced our people to drown in the Heilongjiang River, killing as many as 3,000 people.</p>
<p>With the capital broken and the imperial family fleeing, officials scattered, and a state of anarchy ensued. At that time, there was much talk in the Allied Forces about actually partitioning our country. However, due to the countervailing forces of the great powers and the inability to dominate, and because some countries wanted to curry favor with our country, the discussion came to nothing. Later, with Li Hongzhang ordered to make peace, after much negotiation, the Treaty of Beijing, a treaty of surrender, was signed, leaving an indelible shame on our nation. The most important points of this treaty were the razing of the forts and fortresses between Beijing and Dagu, the indefinite occupation of key points, the delineation of embassy areas, and the payment of huge war reparations. Therefore, although peace was made, our capital was still controlled by the great powers. The Dongjiaomin Lane area was even more so our country's superior government. The indemnity of 450 million taels and its interest was a life-threatening blow to our national finances and national economy.</p>
<p>One reason for this national crisis was the backwardness of our nation's cultural level and the low level of knowledge of the people, which prevented them from launching a widespread anti-imperialist movement with organized and planned action. They were merely driven by emotion and superstitious belief in gods. The participants were generally mobs of proletarian elements, and the leaders were generally foolish nobles and bureaucrats. In addition, our bankrupt agricultural country had no way to withstand the pressure of the united international capitalist countries. Therefore, although this rebellion was a tragic and heroic national movement, its essence was still a primitive riot. The result of the resistance inevitably ended in tragic failure. It was also inevitable. However, after this upheaval, the Qing court still did not wake up at all. Cixi and others in Chang'an even had the thought of "finding pleasure here and forgetting Shu," content with the present. After returning to Beijing, they resumed large-scale construction, diverting naval funds to repair the Old Summer Palace. Politics became increasingly chaotic, and the people's livelihood became increasingly impoverished. Misleading and harming the country, causing our nation to be heavily shackled today and long plunged under the trampling of imperialists, all of which was caused by the foolishness of the Qing court. With the national crisis imminent and the people's grievances deepening daily, the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution was by no means accidental. However, looking at the past from the present, and experiencing past events, we cannot but feel grief and anger. Looking at the present from the future, what will it be like? This is what we should think about three times today.</p>
<p>After the Eight-Nation Alliance forced the signing of the Treaty of Beijing, the conflicts between the imperialist powers in the Far East became even more tense. In 1902, Britain and Japan formed an alliance to contain Russia. Russia and France also formed an alliance to counter it. These four countries all aimed to seize our country's land and rights. In particular, Japan and Russia competed for the three northeastern provinces, and their conflict became increasingly obvious. Finally, in 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, with our country's northeast as the battlefield. As a result of the war, Russia was defeated and signed the Treaty of Portsmouth, again using our country's land and sovereignty as war spoils. Lushun again fell into Japanese hands, and the South Manchurian Railway, which controlled our northeast's fate, was established with this war. The northeast was divided into South Manchuria and North Manchuria, seemingly spheres of influence shared by Japan and Russia. In 1910, Japan formally annexed Korea. As a result, Japan's northward policy achieved its initial success, and the misfortune that suddenly struck our northeast last year on September 18th was rooted at that time.</p>
<p>The time had come to the end of the Qing Dynasty. After repeated disasters, the national power was in danger, and it was on the verge of collapse at any moment. The people's anti-imperialist movement had repeatedly failed. Then, it was realized that unless the autocratic system was overthrown and internal politics were fundamentally clarified, there was no way to talk about dealing with foreign countries. Before the Xinhai Revolution, the revolutionary movement of the Tongmenghui, led by Sun Yat-sen, was in full swing. As a result, in 1911, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown in one fell swoop, and the Republic of China was established, opening a new era in our country's history and pushing</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>our country into a new stage.</p>
<p>The success of the Xinhai Revolution was a good opportunity for our country's reform. The people looked up with hope for the coming of light. However, at that time, the proportion of the feudal economy was still stronger than the capitalist economy, and the leading class of the Xinhai Revolution was extremely weak. Therefore, it soon returned to a dark period and formed a situation of feudal warlords fighting and dividing the country. The national situation became even worse.</p>
<p>(5) In the third year of the Republic, 1914, the contradictions and conflicts among the imperialists deepened and could not be resolved. The First World War broke out. After the outbreak of the war, the European and American powers were all drawn into the cruel slaughterhouse and had no time to look east. This period was another excellent opportunity for us to rise up and strengthen our country. However, Yuan Shikai was in power and plotted to restore the imperial system, colluding deeply with Japan, wanting to use its power to realize his imperial dream. Japan, on the one hand, took advantage of the fierce fighting in the European war, and on the other hand, took advantage of Yuan's profit-seeking obsession, wanting to sweep our country away in one fell swoop. In 1914, it occupied Qingdao in our country under the pretext of declaring war on Germany. In 1915, it suddenly presented us with the extremely harsh Twenty-One Demands, which were almost tantamount to destroying our country, and forced us to keep them strictly secret. Yuan Shikai only sought the early realization of his "emperor's dream" and did not hesitate to sell out the country for his own benefit. Except for slight revisions to the originally proposed conditions, the rest was secretly signed on May 9 of that year without the passage of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The essence of the Twenty-One Demands was tantamount to recognizing us as a protectorate of Japan. If this treaty were implemented, our country would have been destroyed in reality even if it had not been destroyed in name. Japan's continental policy could then celebrate its full realization. The warlords' obsession with power and their willingness to sell out the country were crimes that could not be forgiven even in death.</p>
<p>This period was another time of crisis for our country after the Eight-Nation Alliance. Later, the people rose up to oppose it, fundamentally denying the treasonous Treaty of Twenty-One Demands. The European War ended, and the great powers also rose up to question and protest. The United States solemnly proposed the principle of open doors and equal opportunity. The treaty was shelved and not implemented.</p>
<p>However, Yuan Shikai still did not wake up after this stimulus. In 1916, he proclaimed himself emperor, changed the era name to Hongxian, and was abandoned by his relatives and betrayed by his friends. Provinces raised the banner of opposition. Yuan died in shame, and the Hongxian imperial system ultimately became a dream. The following year, Anhui, Fengtian, Shaanxi, and other provinces seceded from the central government and declared independence in opposition to the parliament and the provisional constitution. Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan and other provinces also declared independence in opposition to the dissolution of parliament. In that year, there was also Zhang Xun's restoration of Puyi's reign. From then on, the country entered a situation of warlord separatism. Civil war continued year after year, politics was chaotic, floods and droughts occurred frequently, and the people could not bear it. Warlords fought each other, with each taking turns to rise and fall. Each relied on imperialists as their backers and each took the expansion of military power and the seizure of rights as their ability. The signing of various unequal treaties and the loss of rights were done openly and without any scruples. For more than ten years since the beginning of the Republic, our nation had truly fallen into the bottom of the eighteenth level of dark hell. At that time, there was a glimmer of light growing in a corner of the southeast, which was the Kuomintang before the Northern Expedition.</p>
<p>Based on Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, the Kuomintang struggled arduously. After the reorganization of 1924, it further established the foundation of the revolution and concentrated the power of the revolution. Its power grew daily. In 1926, it raised the banner of the National Revolution in Guangdong and vowed to launch the Northern Expedition. With the support and assistance of the people, wherever the army went, it was like a bamboo splitting. It captured Wuhan in the shortest time, stabilized Nanjing and Shanghai, and established the capital in Nanjing. During this period, the calls to abolish unequal treaties, eliminate feudal forces, and establish a democratic government shook the rivers and mountains. People around the world were refreshed by our country. They said that the sleeping lion of the East had now awakened and that the world situation was about to change with the success of the Chinese revolution. Our people were also jubilant, thinking that they would finally be able to escape from the fire and water and ascend to a state of peace and comfort, and that our nation would finally be able to break the shackles of unequal treaties and restore its independence and freedom. When the Second Northern Expedition advanced to Jinan, the Japanese imperialists feared the expansion of revolutionary forces and the disruption of their sphere of influence, so they secretly sabotaged and obstructed. They suddenly turned to military intervention, sending troops to Shandong for the second time and shelling Jinan. The May 3rd Incident was thus created.</p>
<p>After the May 3rd Incident occurred, our people across the country were extremely indignant, and the anti-Japanese movement was temporarily raging. However, the government tried its best to tolerate and concede. After repeated negotiations, the Temporary Agreement for the Resolution of the Jinan Case was signed in March 1929, and the Japanese troops began to withdraw. This was the first national crisis after the 1927 National Revolution. To this day, the bullet marks are still on the walls of Jinan, and the bloodstains are still fresh. However, the raging anti-Japanese movement at that time soon disappeared. Who would have thought that five years later, today, there would be a situation in the Northeast and Shanghai that is ten times more dangerous than the Jinan Case?</p>
<p>Although the Second Northern Expedition was interrupted by the May 3rd Incident, the army advanced very quickly. The Beiyang warlords and bureaucratic politicians also adapted to the environment and changed into Kuomintang members. The party government, eager to gain the false reputation of unifying the country, also accepted everything. As a result, warlords and bureaucrats occupied high positions. At that time, the Japanese imperialists, seeing that their forces in North China would be fundamentally shaken, secretly ordered Zhang Zuolin, who was returning to Fengtian in a panic, to be bombed to death at the Huanggu Village Station in 1928, wanting to take advantage of the chaos in the Northeast and seize it. The plot was unsuccessful. When the Northeast changed its flag, Japan tried its best to obstruct it, but it was also unsuccessful. As a result, its ambition to seize our Northeast became even more urgent.</p>
<p>Until last year, due to the transition of the capitalist economy to the third stage, it was shaken and declined and could not support itself. Japan, a capitalist country with a weak foundation, fell into a deep abyss of recession. Industrial decline, trade reduction, credit panic, rising unemployment, and falling agricultural prices forced it to mobilize its strength to re-divide colonies, seize markets and raw materials, and actively prepare for the Second World War. As a result, the September 18th Incident in the Northeast last year and the January 28th Incident in Shanghai this year broke out successively. These two upheavals are the national crises that we are grieving and crying out for today. We have personally experienced them and have not yet forgotten them, so their details will be generally omitted.</p>
<p>(6) We have finished describing the national crises of the past sixty years and feel that we cannot but say one last word. Since the Opium War, our country has experienced upheavals in the past century, and every day has been in a difficult and dangerous situation of survival. As the saying goes, "Adversity makes a country strong" and "A country without foreign enemies will perish." Then, it cannot be said that our country has not experienced many national crises, and it cannot be said that there are few foreign enemies. However, even today, we still cannot extricate ourselves, and are even moving closer to a dangerous situation. Why is this? There is an ancient saying: "A country must insult itself before others insult it, and a country must attack itself before others attack it." Here, we cannot but admit that the reason why our country has long been under the invasion of the great powers is generally due to the disunity of the national spirit and the darkness of internal politics. Today, the storm clouds in the Pacific are growing increasingly urgent, and our country is precisely the center of the Pacific problem. In other words, it is the target of the capitalist imperialist powers competing to seize in order to save their collapsing fate. Therefore, if our nation still does not awaken after experiencing this national crisis and still does not work together to seek self-preservation, then the future will be as dark as ink. Perhaps this is the last national crisis. This is what we must clearly recognize.</p>
<p>Here, we cannot but say a word to the ruling Kuomintang. Since the Kuomintang launched the Northern Expedition in 1926, it has been able to win the support of the people because it can truly represent the interests of the people. In a few years, it unified the country and became the leading party in the revolution. In the past five or six years, there has been no lack of opportunities to strengthen ourselves. However, with the country established, the revolutionary spirit of the party has also been exhausted. Warlord politics and bureaucratic politics have re-emerged. The country is divided, and the party is split, competing for power. Civil wars have occurred repeatedly. In particular, the civil war of the previous year lasted for more than a year, killing 300,000 soldiers and issuing public bonds worth tens of millions of yuan to serve as military expenses. All of these wars are axes that cut off our country's vitality and magnets that attract foreign insults. In other words, they are the evil causes that have led to today's national crisis. If the government today can shift the spirit of internal civil war and prolonged struggle to resisting foreign insults and responding to today's national crisis, then there is no need to worry even if the current situation is critical. However, judging from the current situation, the military men are still divided and self-reliant, the party and government leaders are still talking about political tutelage and are unwilling to give the people the opportunity to jointly save the country, while the old politicians and bureaucrats are taking the opportunity to talk about constitutional government, attempting to make a comeback. Is it really necessary to sacrifice our country, our nation, and our 400 million people to this last national crisis?</p>
<p>We believe that if we want to break the national crisis and seek a way out for our nation today, the people must cultivate the power to destroy warlord politics and bureaucratic politics. The government must have responsible, incorruptible, and truly representative of the interests of the people to clarify politics and re-establish our country's foundation. Then, we can avoid our country from being divided and promote our nation to a new path. The revival of Turkey is our example. The people should rise up together and fight. Light is ahead, and self-sacrifice will lead to rebirth. This is the last opportunity. The river flows, and our nation's future is boundless.</p>

<h3>Military Parade Photography</h3>
<h3>Japanese Emperor's Birthday</h3>
<p>Preparations for Celebration: Japanese residents in Shanghai celebrate the Emperor's Birthday (Tenchōsetsu), which falls on April 29th, with grand ceremonies every year. The venue is Hongkou Park. This year's ceremony is even more elaborate. A special committee composed of representatives from the army, navy, air force, political, and business circles has been formed to organize an expanded celebration. Yesterday, colorful arches and small flags were erected in Hongkou Park, and three reviewing stands were built to accommodate guests from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Shirakawa Arrives</h3>
<p>The military parade was scheduled to begin at 11:00 AM yesterday. Starting around 10:00 AM, Japanese residents flocked to participate. The various units of the 9th Division designated for inspection had arrived by 8:00 AM. At 10:30 AM, representatives from various consulates in Shanghai arrived to offer their congratulations and were received by Japanese Minister Shigemitsu and Consul Murai at the central reviewing stand. At 10:45 AM, Japanese Naval Commander Nomura also arrived with his guards. Finally, at 11:00 AM, Commander-in-Chief Shirakawa and foreign guests arrived for the ceremony. When Shirakawa departed from headquarters, security along the route was extremely tight. Shirakawa's entourage consisted of six vehicles. A police motorcycle squad led the way, followed by Shirakawa, Shirakawa's guards, Chief of Staff Tashiro in the fourth vehicle, four Japanese military adjutants in the fifth, and finally, Western police officers from the Hongkou Police Station providing protection, demonstrating unparalleled security measures. This all happened before the celebratory incident.</p>
<h3>Parade Begins</h3>
<p>As Shirakawa arrived, the Japanese military band played the Japanese national anthem, and everyone stood. Shirakawa, accompanied by Tashiro and other military officers, inspected the Japanese troops for a week before ascending the reviewing stand. Then, the troops were reviewed individually. At 11:30 AM, after the military salute concluded, representatives from various countries left, as the military parade was over. Consequently, only Shirakawa, Ueda, Nomura, Shigemitsu, Murai, and the chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association remained on the reviewing stand, while the injured were helped off the celebratory platform.</p>
<h3>Tight Security</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, during the celebration of the Emperor's Birthday, security around Hongkou Park was exceptionally tight. Traffic near the park was temporarily blocked. From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, trams only ran as far as Laobaizi Road, and Route 2 buses temporarily went to Dixiwei Road. Japanese military police were stationed inside and outside Hongkou Park, maintaining strict surveillance. After the bombing in Hongkou Park, the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Shanghai Municipal Council unofficially stated that the Japanese consulate had informed the PWD yesterday morning that Japanese military and political figures, along with all Japanese residents, would be holding the Emperor's Birthday celebration and military parade in Hongkou Park on the 29th. The Japanese military would be responsible for maintaining security in the vicinity of Hongkou Park, and the PWD need not dispatch police to guard the area to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, since the incident occurred within the area guarded by the Japanese military and the PWD had been informed in advance not to dispatch police, the PWD could not be held responsible in any way. This was very clear.</p>
<h3>Korean Throws Bomb at Shirakawa</h3>
<h3>Bomb Explosion</h3>
<p>At 11:30 AM yesterday morning, after the Japanese military parade concluded and representatives from various countries had left, Japanese residents continued with the Emperor's Birthday celebration organized by the Japanese Residents' Association. Commander Shirakawa, Division Commander Ueda, Commander Nomura, Minister Shigemitsu, Consul-General Murai, Administrative Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association Kawabata, and Secretary-General of the Residents' Association Tomono ascended the main congratulatory platform together. Kawabata and Murai presented congratulatory addresses. As the Japanese residents sang the Japanese national anthem, towards the end, a bomb was suddenly thrown from behind the platform, landing to the right of Minister Shigemitsu and Commander Nomura, and to the left of Division Commander Ueda. Those on the platform saw the bomb and panicked. About four or five minutes later, a violent explosion occurred around 11:45 AM amidst heavy rain. Shigemitsu and the six others on the platform fell to the ground, all injured. The whole scene was thrown into chaos. Japanese military police rushed onto the platform and helped the injured off the platform, sending them to Fumin Hospital and the Japanese Army and Navy Hospitals. The celebratory platform was six to seven feet high. After the incident, it was discovered that the platform had been blasted with a large hole, and the ground was also cratered, demonstrating the bomb's immense power. Another bomb was found behind the platform, covered with cloth and unexploded, later taken away by the Japanese military police. The rumor that it was a hand-slipped bomb is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Minister Shigemitsu</h3>
<h3>Western-Suited Youth</h3>
<p>Thousands of Japanese residents stood in groups below the platform, especially crowded in front of and behind the platform. According to eyewitnesses, the bomber was a Western-suited youth who appeared to be Korean. He was standing about three meters behind the platform, making it easy to hit the target.</p>
<h3>Shigemitsu and Others Injured</h3>
<h3>On the Commander's Platform</h3>
<p>There were seven people on the commander's platform in the center of the venue: Army Commander Shirakawa, 9th Division Commander Ueda, Japanese Minister Shigemitsu, Consul-General Murai, Japanese Naval Commander Nomura, Administrative Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association Kawabata, and Secretary-General of the Residents' Association Tomono. Murai was first on the left, followed by Shirakawa, Ueda, Nomura, Shigemitsu, Kawabata, and Tomono, arranged in a row.</p>
<h3>Division Commander Ueda</h3>
<h3>Intense Explosive Force</h3>
<p>The bomb landed in the center of the commander's platform, slightly to the right, directly hitting Shigemitsu and Kawabata. First, a puff of black smoke was seen. Shirakawa and Ueda shouted that there was a bomb and quickly retreated a dozen steps. A minute later, a loud explosion like thunder occurred. Fortunately, all seven people on the platform had retreated; otherwise, none would have survived. Kawabata was the most severely injured but still jumped off the commander's platform, calling for help. Shigemitsu's right leg was injured and bleeding profusely. The platform was stained with blood, showing the bomb's intense power.</p>
<h3>Glimpse of Injuries</h3>
<p>Kawabata's injuries were the most severe, with chest and abdominal injuries. He was unconscious upon arrival at the hospital, with internal injuries and his life in critical condition. Next was Minister Shigemitsu, with injuries to his right leg and chest, and left hand. Nomura was injured in the head, right forehead, and right eye. Murai was injured in the right shin. Tomono was injured in the right arm and left chest. Shirakawa was injured on the right side of his face. Ueda's injuries were the lightest, with an injury to his left foot.</p>
<h3>Sent to Hospitals</h3>
<p>After Shigemitsu and others were injured, Japanese military police on the scene sent the injured to various hospitals. Shirakawa and Ueda are now at the Hirajo Road Military Hospital, while Shigemitsu, Murai, and Kawabata are at the Japanese Naval Hospital at the end of North Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Hospital Reports</h3>
<p>Shigemitsu, Murai, and Kawabata were sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment. According to Fumin Hospital, Shigemitsu suffered blast injuries to his right forearm and lower right limb, and a fracture in his lower right leg, requiring three to four months to heal. Murai injured his lower left leg and could recover in three weeks. Kawabata suffered blast injuries to his right chest, right abdomen, and right foot, and his life was in danger. Dr. Tonimiya Hiroshi, the hospital director, stated that Minister Shigemitsu had more than twenty wounds, a fracture in his lower right leg, requiring one month for the fracture to set. He might be permanently disabled after recovery. Kawabata's injuries were severe, and his life was in danger, with bleeding in his right abdomen and blood deficiency due to his age. A blood transfusion was necessary to give him a chance of survival. Commander Shirakawa and Division Commander Ueda were transported by vehicle to the Japanese Army Military Hospital for treatment. According to the Military Hospital, Shirakawa's blast injuries were relatively minor and could heal in three weeks. Ueda's left lower leg was injured in the blast and could heal in two weeks. Commander Nomura and Tomono were transported by vehicle to the Japanese Naval Landing Force Hospital. According to the hospital, Nomura lost his right eyeball, his right chest, left abdomen, and both lower limbs were injured in the blast, and his right little finger was shattered. Full treatment would take one month. Tomono suffered blast injuries to his left forehead and right forearm, and full treatment would take one month.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Nomura Fleet</h3>
<h3>Toes Amputated</h3>
<p>Shirakawa and Ueda had the lightest injuries. Yesterday afternoon, Shirakawa's facial surgery left him quite conscious. According to doctors, he could recover in about a month. Ueda's left foot was injured in the blast. After arriving at the Military Hospital, he met with Japanese journalists around 3:00 PM, nonchalantly smoking a cigar. Last night at 8:00 PM, doctors amputated three small toes from his left foot. His recovery is going well, and he should fully recover in about two weeks.</p>
<h3>Right Eye Blinded</h3>
<p>At the Naval Hospital, Commander Nomura of the Japanese Third Fleet had shrapnel embedded in his right eye. Doctors removed his right eye, and shrapnel was also removed from his right forehead. However, he suffered great mental trauma and required long-term rest. Secretary-General of the Residents' Association Tomono was not seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Shigemitsu's Injuries</h3>
<p>Minister Shigemitsu at Fumin Hospital suffered severe injuries to his right leg, with excessive blood loss, which was quite dangerous. Last night, surgeons removed three pieces of shrapnel. Due to mental weakness, he refused to see any guests. According to doctors, if there are no complications in the coming days, he can be expected to recover in a few months; otherwise, his right shin must be amputated, requiring four or five months of long-term medical care. Kawabata's injuries were 9 out of 10 chances of being untreatable.</p>
<h3>Consul General Murai</h3>
<h3>Spectators Injured</h3>
<p>When the bomb exploded, shrapnel flew in all directions. Three Japanese spectators below the platform were affected and suffered minor injuries, and were sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Family Concerned</h3>
<p>The Japanese Allied News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 29th that Minister Shigemitsu's wife, who is currently at the residence of Mr. Hayashi Ichizo in Motoyama Village, Muko County, Hyogo Prefecture, was concerned about her husband who was injured in the bombing in Shanghai today. Shigemitsu's wife, who gave birth to a son a few days ago, told reporters today that she had not heard from Shigemitsu for a long time and never expected such an incident. It was also reported that Mrs. Shirakawa, the wife of General Shirakawa, recently underwent appendicitis surgery and is currently resting at home in Yoyogi.</p>
<h3>Residents' Association Chairman Kawabata</h3>
<h3>Perpetrator Immediately Arrested</h3>
<h3>Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>At the time, Japanese military police were densely stationed around the platform. They saw a Western-suited youth behind the platform suddenly strike a match. Where the flame ignited, a puff of black smoke rushed towards the commander's platform. Shortly after, a loud explosion occurred, revealing it was a bomb. The Japanese military police immediately grabbed the youth from behind, and Japanese people around the platform helped subdue him, beating him severely. His face was covered in blood. A squad of military police escorted him to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on Jiangwan Road for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Strict Search</h3>
<h3>Suspects</h3>
<p>After the perpetrator was arrested, both the east and west entrances of the venue were immediately closed. As attendees left the venue one by one, they were subjected to a thorough search, with no one spared, including Japanese people. An additional Russian suspect, one Westerner (a Shanghai Municipal Council employee), and five Chinese were also arrested.</p>
<h3>Martial Law Declared</h3>
<h3>Emergency Measures</h3>
<p>Since the incident yesterday morning, the Japanese military had implemented special martial law in the 40 areas of Hongkou Park. Military and naval officers, led by majors and below, were stationed along Shikota Road, Jiangwan Road, Dazi Road, Huanglu Road, and Dixiwei Road to conduct strict patrols. Japanese and Korean people leaving Hongkou Park were all subjected to inspections. For a time, all roads were filled with Japanese soldiers, and pedestrian traffic was prohibited in the area.</p>
<h3>Absolute Secrecy</h3>
<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
<p>After the incident, Japanese journalists gathered at the Japanese consulate and the Japanese military headquarters to collect information. They were told that investigations were underway, and all information about the perpetrator and interrogation details were to be kept strictly confidential. No information would be released until the investigation was complete. Last night, the Japanese consulate also called Japanese newspapers, instructing them to be cautious about disclosing information about the incident.</p>
<h3>Perpetrator's Confession</h3>
<h3>Suspect's Statements</h3>
<p>According to the Japan-Japan News Agency, the arrested Chinese, Russian, and Korean were taken to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on Jiangwan Road for interrogation by the military police chief. The five Chinese were released because they were not deemed to be heavily involved. The Russian confessed to being the gatekeeper of Hongkou Park, and the Japanese suspected him of protecting the perpetrator and assisting in the crime, so he was detained. The Korean man, identified as Yoon Bong-gil, 25 years old, an employee of a laundry company in the French Concession, stated that he had come to Shanghai from Qingdao last August and had joined the Korean Independence Party. He directly admitted to throwing the bomb to assassinate Shirakawa and others and claimed that three Korean friends were accomplices. The military police headquarters is now investigating his masterminds to arrest all his accomplices.</p>
<h3>Announcement by the Japanese Military</h3>
<h3>Official Statement</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Headquarters later announced that at 11:30 AM, a military parade was held at the New Park to celebrate the Emperor's Birthday. After the ceremony, a congratulatory meeting was held, hosted by the Residents' Association. Commander Shirakawa, Division Commander Ueda, Commander Nomura of the Third Fleet, Minister Shigemitsu, Consul-General Murai, Administrative Chairman of the Residents' Association Kawabata, and Secretary-General Tomono of the Residents' Association went to the congratulatory platform. Kawabata and Murai read congratulatory messages, and everyone sang the national anthem together. After completion, someone threw a bomb from the left rear of the congratulatory platform. As it exploded, those on the platform were injured. The perpetrator was immediately arrested by the alert military police and taken to the Jiangwan Japanese Military Police Headquarters for questioning. In addition, Chinese and foreigners (employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council) were arrested but were unrelated to the case. At the time of the incident, the Japanese military police immediately implemented emergency martial law, scattering sentries to inspect the audience.</p>
<h3>Condolences from China and Abroad</h3>
<h3>British Minister Visits</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, British Minister Lampson personally visited Shirakawa and Ueda at the Japanese Army Hospital on Hirajo Road. Ueda, though injured, received him and expressed his gratitude.</p>
<h3>Condolences from Various Consulates</h3>
<p>After hearing the news, consuls from various countries visited the Japanese consulate to express their condolences. Some personally visited Shigemitsu at Fumin Hospital and were received by embassy secretaries on behalf of Shigemitsu. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi also visited to express his condolences.</p>

<h3>Telegram from the Japanese Government</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Japanese side received a telegram from Tokyo expressing sympathy for the injured and instructing the Japanese authorities to swiftly apprehend any remaining accomplices.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Sends Condolences</h3>
<p>Reuters reported from Geneva on the 29th that British Foreign Secretary Simon also personally expressed his condolences to Nagaoka, the Japanese chief delegate, and conveyed the regards of British Prime Minister MacDonald.</p>
<h3>Impact on the Armistice Conference</h3>
<h3>Possible Delay</h3>
<p>Since the diplomatic representatives of China and Japan, along with ministers from various friendly nations, met at the British consulate the other day, a conference was immediately held to formally pass the compromise proposal from the British minister. This proposal was to be telegraphed to the League of Nations to modify and pass the draft resolution that had been previously agreed upon. The armistice conference could then continue negotiations. Yesterday, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the League of Nations resolution could be passed on Saturday, so that the central government's instructions could arrive in Shanghai on Monday morning, and negotiations could be held in the afternoon. The conference could be held by Tuesday at the latest. However, since the incident at Hongkou Park occurred yesterday afternoon, the main military and political figures of the Japanese forces stationed in Shanghai were seriously injured, including Ueda and Shigemitsu, who were the chief representatives at the armistice conference. Therefore, if the League of Nations could pass the resolution, Japan would have to appoint another commissioner to attend in the near future, and it is difficult to know whether one could be sent in the short term. Therefore, the conference may be delayed again.</p>
<h3>Change of Representatives</h3>
<p>According to another source, the armistice conference will proceed as usual, and the Japanese side plans to have the first secretary of the embassy, ​​Moriya, represent Shigemitsu.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Dispatch</h3>
<p>Tokyo Electric Communication reported on the 29th that the official and alternate signatories of the Japanese armistice conference were suddenly injured. The aftercare plan is now being considered by relevant authorities from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military. Because the severity of the injuries to Minister Shigemitsu and Lieutenant General Ueda is unclear, further arrangements are waiting for a public telegram from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Foreign Media Coverage</h3>
<p>The Great Evening News reported that today is the Japanese Emperor's Birthday. This morning, Japanese troops in this port held a military parade at Hongkou Park to celebrate the occasion. Just as the ceremony was completed, around 11:30 AM, an unknown person threw a bomb at the observation stand, injuring Japanese Minister Shigemitsu and five other Japanese officials. It is heard that Shigemitsu was seriously injured. According to the latest news, Shigemitsu suffered severe injuries to both legs and body, with a lot of blood loss. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, doctors claimed that there was great hope for his life, but he may need six or seven months of recovery. The other injured are General Shirakawa, Commander of the Japanese Forces in the Shanghai area, Vice Admiral Nomura, Commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy and Head of the Japanese Navy in Chinese Waters, Lieutenant General Ueda, Commander of the 9th Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai, Consul General Murai stationed in Shanghai, and Mr. Kawabata, a Japanese merchant. Shigemitsu and Murai are currently staying at Fumin Hospital. Murai injured his right toe. It is heard that Shirakawa suffered severe injuries to his head and hands and is currently staying at the Japanese Army Hospital. It is heard that Nomura suffered severe injuries to his head and is currently staying at the Japanese Naval Hospital. His right eye may be blinded. The extent of Ueda's injuries is unknown. Kawabata's injuries were also not minor. After the officials received the salute from the marching troops in the square and returned to the stand, they were about to join in singing the national anthem, while the foreigners observing the ceremony on the stand were leaving the stand, when suddenly a bomb exploded with a loud noise. According to eyewitnesses on the scene, the entire park was in chaos. The Japanese military immediately surrounded the park, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. As the Great American Evening News went to print, the situation remained tense. It was later heard that many people had been detained, including three Koreans. It was also heard that this case was committed by Koreans. One Korean was detained by Japanese civilians and severely beaten, causing serious injuries. He was covered in blood when he was transferred to the hospital from the park. It was heard that he died in the hospital shortly after. Mr. Hibbert, an American from the Engineering Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, witnessed the incident and is currently being held for investigation. The Chinese authorities have denied that Chinese people were involved in the case, stating that Chinese people were not allowed to enter the park at that time. According to reports, when Shirakawa and others entered Hongkou Park this morning, they had a large entourage of four cars, led by one motorized bicycle from the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The first car was Shirakawa's car, strictly guarded by armed police officers. The second car had more armed military police officers. The third car carried Shirakawa's chief of staff and four adjutants. The fourth car carried armed foreign police officers from the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Japanese Officials Bombed in Shanghai, Unease in Geneva</h3>
<p>Deep Fears of Impacting Armistice Negotiations</p>
<p>Special Committee Drafts Resolution</p>
<p>Prepared to Submit to the General Assembly</p>
<p>Japanese Government Instructs Not to Vote</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported from Geneva on the 29th that although League of Nations personnel clearly knew that the Shanghai bombing incident occurred in a Japanese-occupied area and that the perpetrator was Korean and could not be blamed on China, they deeply feared that the conclusion of the armistice agreement would be delayed as a result. The Chinese delegation believes that this case is purely an internal Japanese affair and is unrelated to China or the Sino-Japanese situation. The Japanese delegation is currently preparing an official document to notify the League of Nations, and its spokesperson stated that it will take more than two months for Minister Shigemitsu to recover from his injuries, so the signing of the armistice agreement will inevitably be delayed. It is also said that only Minister Shigemitsu has the authority to sign on behalf of the Tokyo government. Key figures in the League of Nations share the same view as the Chinese representatives, believing that the Shanghai bombing incident should not have any serious repercussions at the League of Nations General Assembly on Saturday, but may further solidify the Japanese people's reservation about the resolution. Today, Yan Huiqing, the Chinese chief delegate, told the Associated Press that the Chinese government felt the matter was extremely unfortunate, but he saw no reason to blame the Chinese people and said that this further proved that occupying the territory of other countries by force may not be successful and is not beneficial. However, key figures in the League of Nations fear that this move will make Japan even more unwilling to talk about an immediate withdrawal of troops.</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported from Geneva on the 29th that after news of the bombing of six Japanese civil and military officials in Shanghai this morning reached here, a general sense of unease emerged among the people. In particular, the lack of detailed information led to rampant rumors outside, making people increasingly anxious. Dozens of journalists gathered at the hotel where the Japanese representatives were staying, speculating about the impact of this move on future developments in the Far East. At noon, the Japanese delegation finally issued a statement verifying the news but only confirming that the six people who were injured were expected to survive and did not provide detailed information. Later, the Chinese delegation also issued a statement expressing regret but solemnly declaring that the Chinese people were not involved in this move because Chinese people were not allowed to enter the parade ground, and said that the perpetrator and accomplices may be Korean terrorist party members. However, although this move is unrelated to the Chinese people, people here are still worried that it will inevitably affect the Shanghai armistice negotiations and the discussions at the League of Nations General Assembly on Saturday.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Geneva on the 29th that the incident at Hongkou Park in Shanghai has caused widespread pain. Although China and Japan may use this as propaganda material during tomorrow's meeting, it does not appear that it will affect the proceedings here. The draft of the special committee of nineteen countries has now been completed, and all items remain unchanged. However, the following text will be substituted for item eleven: "The (special committee) believes that the committees that monitor the implementation of Articles 1, 2, and 3 of the agreement, as stipulated in Attachments 1, 2, and 3 of the draft agreement, have the right to call attention to any negligence in fulfilling any provision of the above articles, in accordance with the explicit provisions of the attachments cited."</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Geneva on the 29th that Simon (Belgian representative) and Panggu (French representative) visited Nagaoka, the Japanese chief delegate to the League of Nations, today to express their condolences for the incident at Hongkou Park in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Tokyo on the 29th that Reuters has learned today that the Japanese government has instructed the Japanese representatives to the League of Nations to attend the League of Nations General Assembly meeting but not to vote when the resolution on the Shanghai case is voted on.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Geneva on the 28th that the special committee of nineteen countries of the League of Nations met at 5:00 PM today. Chairman Simon reported on the progress of the negotiations on the Shanghai incident. The meeting received a report stating that the Chinese and Japanese representatives had reopened talks in Shanghai and that the two sides had reached an agreement on the points of contention that had halted the meeting. After receiving this report, the special committee proceeded to draft a resolution to be submitted to the General Assembly at 10:30 AM on Saturday. It is heard that the Shanghai compromise proposal will be included in the General Assembly resolution. Japan may not participate in the vote, and the other countries are bound to unanimously approve it. Although Japan supports the new proposal from British Minister Lambson, it opposes the inclusion of the proposal in the League of Nations resolution because Japan believes that the truce should be resolved in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported from Geneva on the 28th that it is said today that U.S. Secretary of State Stimson expressed disappointment with Britain's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute. He will now remain in Geneva until Saturday, hoping to persuade Britain to follow a firmer Far East policy. The nineteen-nation committee of the League of Nations met at 5:12 PM this evening and adjourned at 6:32 PM, issuing a statement claiming that negotiations had reopened in Shanghai and that an agreement had been reached on the points of contention that had previously halted the negotiations. The nineteen-nation committee had previously drafted a draft resolution due to the suspension of the negotiations, which will be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly at 10:30 AM on Saturday. However, key figures in the League of Nations still say that the situation at the meeting remains somewhat confusing, which may lead to the League of Nations General Assembly on Saturday being suspended halfway, which is also unknown. Tokyo has yet to decide whether to abstain from voting on the resolution in the General Assembly or to submit reservations. The formal telegram from Shanghai received by the nineteen-nation committee only stated that the Chinese and Japanese representatives had accepted the compromise proposal put forward by Lambson, so optimists believed that the situation in Shanghai would soon be clarified. Conversely, observers fear that if Japan insists on some reservations at the General Assembly on Saturday, China will rise up and fight for it with the help of various small countries, especially if Japan insists on convening a round table meeting before all Japanese troops are withdrawn, it will inevitably cause fierce debate. The reason why U.S. Secretary of State Stimson felt disappointed with Britain is said to be that Stimson felt that Britain had a tendency to delay the League of Nations' policy of resolving the Shanghai case.</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported from London on the 29th that the British newspapers attach great importance to the Shanghai bombing incident and strongly emphasize the importance of the positions of the Japanese people injured. This evening, each evening publication recorded the incident on the cover with a large title of 70 points.</p>
<p>Letter from the City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Letter from the League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the League of Nations Investigation Team, saying: "In this situation, we believe that arguing about right and wrong with Japan is of no help. However, while the Japanese continue their brutal and heinous actions, they still speak of benevolence, righteousness, and morality. How can we remain silent? The world is not short of gullible people who are easily deceived by Japan's false propaganda. Foreigners who claim to be experts on China and have lived in China for a long time are accustomed to all kinds of reckless behavior. In recent years, their arrogant attitude has been somewhat restrained, and they now take this opportunity to fan the flames, spreading slanderous remarks about China to the world. Therefore, the true facts are unable to be brought to light. How much more numerous, less serious, are the atrocities committed by Japan against China than the provocative acts attributed by Japan to China? However, China cannot resort to Japan's practice of bombarding cities and massacring people as a means of coercion. Therefore, what China has suffered at the hands of Japan has not attracted the world's attention. Even impartial people who strongly condemn Japan's actions in Manchuria cannot help but mistakenly believe that China must have given cause for criticism. The historical background of the Manchurian Incident, as propagated by Japan, is a complete distortion of right and wrong. We hereby correct it point by point and respectfully request that you pay attention to it. We also enclose an article entitled 'Refutation of the Japanese Propaganda Regarding the Causes of the Sino-Japanese Conflicts.' The article describes the situation in more detail and includes authentic evidence that can serve as corroboration for the points made in this letter. The materials cited are based on Japanese accounts or Western reports. Although these few pages are insufficient to cover everything, readers who study the materials on Sino-Japanese relations will surely understand that every word and every sentence in this letter is based on facts. As for the facts of the Manchurian Incident of September 18th last year and the Shanghai Incident of January 28th this year, they are known to all and have been heard by all. We will not repeat them. Manchuria has shallower relations with the powers, and it often goes unnoticed by the world. Japan's censorship of news is extremely strict. Therefore, the news coming from Manchuria, apart from Japanese propaganda, is scarce. However, if one pays attention to the catastrophe in Shanghai, one can imagine what the people of Manchuria have suffered. Western newspapers in Shanghai are deeply afraid of offending Japan and dare not comment much. However, if one reads their news, one will find countless records of Westerners witnessing the Japanese poisoning the Chinese and abusing women and children."</p>
<p>▲ The Issue of Provocation</p>
<p>"Imagine a situation where someone intrudes into a person's house. The owner cannot simply throw them out but must swallow their anger and deal with them. However, if the owner does not enthusiastically comply with the intruder's orders, the intruder resorts to violence, even going so far as to lock the owner out of their own house and openly declare to the public that the owner has engaged in provocative acts and that, for self-defense, they have no choice but to expel the owner. Onlookers, intimidated by the intruder's power and seeing that the owner is unable to retaliate, also become discouraged. Not only do they not condemn the intruder, but they even echo their words, saying that the owner should simply endure the intruder's tyranny and should not resist in any way, and that the fault for this disaster lies entirely with the owner. Alas, this is the phenomenon of the Sino-Japanese problem before the Shanghai Incident. Westerners are unfamiliar with the historical background of Sino-Japanese relations, which leads to a misunderstanding of the truth of this incident. In the history of Sino-Japanese relations over the past fifty years, there is nothing but a record of Japan's overt and covert aggression. Even those unfamiliar with Eastern history should be able to recall how Japan seized our Taiwan, annexed our Ryukyu Islands, and broke its promises to destroy Korea; how it forced us to accept the Twenty-One Demands during the height of the European war; how it violated our neutrality during the Russo-Japanese War and the siege of Qingdao; how it used money and weapons to support local armies that were rebelling against the central government; how it occupied Shandong, obstructed our National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition, bombarded Jinan, and massacred our negotiator Cai Gongshi; how it assassinated Zhang Zuolin; and how it condoned the massacre of Chinese nationals by Koreans (resulting in 143 deaths, 345 injuries, and 72 missing persons, with the riots lasting for ten days). As for Manchuria, the number of illegal infringements on our national rights by Japan is countless. Compared with Japan's so-called illegal acts by China, they are simply not comparable. For example, after Russia withdrew its railway guards, Japan, in violation of its agreements, did not withdraw its police, setting up police stations throughout Manchuria and arresting and killing Chinese people outside the railway zone. All these things still exist today. On what cruel and unreasonable treaty are they based? The Japanese often say that China has violated treaties and infringed upon Japan's rights. What are these rights but things obtained through violence, oppression, and robbery? Even if rights obtained through robbery do not have to be returned to the original owner and should be considered sacred and inviolable, Japan has already exceeded the scope it set for itself. Now, let us step back and say that even if China, as the Japanese say, has occasionally done something that Japan can criticize, it is only that it has not enthusiastically complied with the treaties it was forced to recognize. How can this be compared to Japan's active aggression? Any one example of Japan's infringement of China's rights can completely negate Japan's so-called provocative acts by China. Japan often uses minor pretexts to send warships to China, occupy our land, and bombard our cities, and in the end, China must apologize and pay compensation. As for the various acts of violence that China has suffered, it can only protest, but Japan ignores them all, and the incidents eventually disappear without a trace. Take the Korean massacre last year as an example. The Japanese military's strict precautions against Koreans are well known. When the massacre occurred, the Chinese consul immediately requested protection, but the brutal events unfolded for ten days without any effective restraint from the Japanese police. China demanded compensation and an apology, but Japan replied that these were the actions of the masses and that the government could not be held responsible. This case remains unresolved to this day. Now, compare the Korean massacre with the Shanghai Incident. Five Japanese monks were beaten by Chinese people near the border of the Shanghai International Settlement, and one monk died from his injuries. Japanese ruffians launched a large-scale retaliation, setting fire to the Sanyou Industrial Society and killing a Chinese policeman. Afterwards, the Japanese consul actually issued an ultimatum to the Shanghai Municipal Government, demanding an apology and prohibiting anti-Japanese activities by the public, while saying nothing about the Japanese ruffians' murder and arson. The ultimatum stated, 'If a satisfactory reply is not received, the Japanese military will take free action.' In order to preserve Shanghai, the municipal government completely accepted the conditions. At that time, why couldn't the municipal government have replied to Japan in the tone of the Korean massacre, saying that this was the action of the people and that the Chinese government was not responsible? The Japanese consul's reply to China included, 'At present, it can be considered that the matter has ended or temporarily come to an end.' Who knew that on the same night, the Japanese military attacked Zhabei, and the events that followed occurred not long after, so we need not repeat them. Which is more serious, the murder of Captain Nakamura or the murder of Zhang Zuolin? Japan never sought to resolve the bombing of Zhang, and even the investigation report has not been published to this day. The Tokyo police department prohibited newspapers from publishing news or commentary related to Japan's involvement in the bombing, and its government even requested that the parliament abandon its questioning of the case. How different is the Nakamura incident from this? The Chinese authorities firmly believe that Nakamura's visit to Mongolia was for military reconnaissance, but they still arrested the suspected criminals and sought a fair resolution. On October 17th of last year, the *Millard's Review* published an article by Harry Parker Howald stating that Captain Nakamura's passport claimed that he was a scholar living in Mongolia studying geographical problems, while the Japanese consul in Shenyang, Morishima, claimed that Nakamura was still serving in the military and was not on leave. The Japanese Army Ministry made a big fuss, using this incident to vigorously incite the military and the public's animosity towards China, as a pretext for aggression. Subsequently, seeing that China was making concessions and arresting the suspects, fearing that the matter would be peacefully resolved, they preemptively destroyed two meters of the South Manchurian Railway tracks, and the already prepared military invasion was launched on the night of September 18th. Japan often uses such incidents as a pretext for inadequate apologies and compensation, invading our cities and killing our people. The violence that China has suffered at the hands of Japan is hundreds of times more serious than such incidents, and our protests have all failed to elicit any attention from Japan. The Japanese, relying on their barbarity and strength, interfere with China's construction of railways in its own territory, claiming that it infringes upon their rights and violates treaties (Japan claims that the construction of the Dalu Railway and the South Manchurian Railway as parallel routes violates the so-called 1905 secret agreement, but Japan did not present this secret agreement at the Washington Conference). If China's construction of its own railways can be used as a pretext for Japan to occupy all of Manchuria, then how should Japan's continuous infringement of our rights, such as stationing troops in the South Manchurian Railway, establishing police stations in the interior of Manchuria, seizing Chinese mining rights, etc., be proportional to the severity of the incidents? If China were to inflict on Japan the active aggression that Japan has inflicted on us, then, if the positions were reversed, the severity of Japan's retaliation, even if it occupied our entire country and annihilated all of our people, would probably not be enough to quell its anger."</p>
<p>▲ The Issue of Protecting Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>"Japan uses the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese to send its army and navy with all kinds of deadly weapons, resulting in the loss of Chinese lives and property, the destruction of peace and order, the complete cessation of commerce, and the endangerment of overseas Chinese of all countries, including Japanese overseas Chinese. Shanghai, Manchuria, and Jinan are all examples of this. Japan often claims that overseas Chinese are in danger as a pretext for large-scale military aggression. If the danger to overseas Chinese can be used as a pretext for invading our land and killing our people, then what about those who have already been poisoned? At the time of the Korean massacre, did Japan allow China to send troops to protect and rescue our overseas Chinese from the harm that had already occurred (not the danger that was about to occur)? No. The Japanese government refused to take responsibility and completely refused to pay compensation or apologize. Since the Manchurian Incident, Japanese overseas Chinese have not been in any real danger in terms of life and property. Japan's dispatch of troops to China is simply intended to create this danger. Since September 18th, the Japanese have provoked us in every possible way, which is intolerable to any nation. However, in the areas under Chinese jurisdiction, only one Japanese monk was killed, as mentioned above, and a Japanese couple in Fuzhou. Even the cause of their deaths has not yet been verified and may be suicide. Our provincial government has accepted extremely humiliating conditions for this. All of this is evidence of our government's ability to protect foreigners. If such a thing had happened in another country, could Japanese overseas Chinese have been so safe? The Chinese people's self-restraint and the Japanese people's barbarity are unparalleled in the world. The number of Japanese overseas Chinese in Shanghai decreased from 25,000 to 14,000 within a month after the incident. Such is the result of the Japanese government's so-called protection of overseas Chinese."</p>
<p>▲ The Issue of Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>"Suppressing bandits is also a pretext for the Japanese to send troops. Any army that does not obey Japanese orders can be arbitrarily labeled as bandits by the Japanese. Japan's aggression has created an unprecedented chaos in Manchuria. The Japanese army has destroyed the Chinese administration, disbanded the Chinese army, and bandits have inevitably increased. The book 'Japan's Military Actions in Manchuria' by Count Goto Shimpei and the records of the 1930 Conference to Uphold Rights in Manchuria and Mongolia are sufficient to prove that Japan's policy is to cultivate bandits, support bandits, and create opportunities for aggression."</p>
<p>▲ The Issue of Boycotting Japanese Goods</p>
<p>"Boycotting Japanese goods is a manifestation of the people's will and a very moderate expression of indignation by a weak country against foreign insults. Even if the action is not entirely legal, it is similar to the act of going on strike and is purely a matter of domestic law. The occasional excesses of the Chinese people in boycotting Japanese goods are entirely directed at their own people. A nation's people are indignant at another nation's seizure of their land and killing of their people and use boycotts as a passive form of self-defense. How can this be called a provocative act? How can this be used as a pretext for military intervention? If a family is bullied by a shop and agrees not to buy goods from the shop to show their indignation, even if they use coercion against family members who do not comply, it has nothing to do with outsiders, and it cannot be said that the shop owner can break into the house and use violence to bully them. How is Japan's treatment of China any different? Moreover, economic boycotts against aggressors are stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. The Chinese people are merely implementing the obligations that all countries should have performed long ago."</p>
<p>▲ The Issue of China's Disunity</p>
<p>"Japan often says that China cannot be unified. Even if we step back and say that this statement is true, it is still China's internal matter. How many years China needs to go through its transitional period is none of Japan's business. The only thing friendly nations can do is help China move towards unification. How can Japan take advantage of the Chinese people's inability to unite and seize the opportunity to plunder and destroy at will? The Nine-Power Treaty foresaw this and clearly stipulated that the signatory countries should not take advantage of China's current situation to obtain special privileges. All countries in the world seek commercial development and therefore yearn for China's unification as soon as possible. Only Japan has ulterior motives and is deeply afraid that once China is unified, it will not be able to carry out its cunning plans and schemes. Therefore, every time China has an opportunity to unify, Japan must find a way to destroy it, such as bombarding Jinan, cutting off the Jinpu Railway, obstructing the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, plotting to kill Zhang Zuolin in order to cause internal divisions in the three northeastern provinces, and coercing Zhang Xueliang to prevent him from returning to the central government. All of these are examples of this."</p>
<p>▲ The Issue of National Self-Determination</p>
<p>"The Japanese claim that the independent government of Manchuria is the self-determination of the Manchurian people and has nothing to do with Japan, and that the Japanese government does not allow Japanese people to participate in it. In fact, the independence of Manchuria is entirely managed by the Japanese. The Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria used force to eliminate the original provincial governments of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang and openly provided assistance to the rebels. The Japanese troops and the rebel troops jointly attacked the Chinese troops. This has been heard of frequently and has become increasingly blatant. The facts are there and cannot be refuted. The personnel of the so-called Manchurian government are nothing more than a bunch of good-for-nothings who are willing to be puppets. The Qing Dynasty's deposed emperor Puyi was taken to Manchuria by the Japanese by force. People like Yu Chonghan, Xi Qia, Yuan Jinkai, and Zang Shiyi were either lured or threatened by the Japanese. The *Great Beauty News* reported that 'Zang Shiyi was imprisoned by the Japanese army for three months' and then 'placed in prison before being placed in the position of governor.' Is this self-determination? The Manchu people are merely a historical name. The majority of the people in the three northeastern provinces are immigrants from China proper and their descendants. The few Manchus have long been assimilated by the Han Chinese and cannot be distinguished. In today's Manchuria, it is very difficult to find real Manchus. Therefore, invoking the term national self-determination for the Manchurian problem is simply a fallacy. So-called national self-determination is just a Japanese excuse. What value has it ever had in convincing people? The Japanese previously violated their promises and annexed Korea, also going through the stages of independence, protection, and annexation. Who can they deceive by using that example? Moreover, the Japanese army in Manchuria openly drove out the Chinese local governments, attacked the Chinese army, seized salt taxes, bank deposits, industrial materials, and military equipment, invaded Chinese railways, telegraphs, telephones, and postal administration, and closed the Sino-American joint venture wireless telephone. All of these are direct actions by the Japanese army and have never been done by the puppet government it controls. How can there still be any doubt that this is a violation of the independence and territorial integrity of China guaranteed by the Nine-Power Treaty?"</p>
<h3>▲ The Issue of Japan's Overpopulation</h3>
<p>"The Japanese often use overpopulation as a reason to consider Manchuria as an outlet, as a pretext for their aggression. Those who listen do not see the deception and are often misled. The immigration policy set by Prime Minister Tanaka is to first drive Korean people to Manchuria and then transplant Japanese people to Korea, while instigating the Korean people in Manchuria to clash with the Chinese people, so that they can use it as an excuse to commit aggression. Except for Korea, Japan's colonies are all sparsely populated, and even its homeland of Hokkaido has many uncultivated areas. If Japan is indeed overpopulated, it should first fully utilize its territory and colonies before making other plans. According to the 1929 *Jiji Nenkan*, the annual per capita rice consumption in Japan is as follows: 1896-1900: 0.930 koku; 1906-1910: 1.022 koku; 1923-1927: 1.123 koku. Rice is the most important food in Japan. This shows that the Japanese people's livelihood is improving day by day. According to the book by Japanese author Chiba Toyoji, the living expenses per Chinese farming household in South Manchuria are 62.45 yuan, while the living expenses per farming household in Japan proper are 154.51 yuan. Comparing the two, there is a huge difference in prosperity. Do they want to compete with the farmers in Manchuria for food when the Japanese have a better livelihood? Japan's grain production is almost entirely self-sufficient. From 1923 to 1927, the annual consumption of rice in Japan proper was 66,745,000 koku, of which less than 5% was imported from foreign countries (1929 *Jiji Nenkan*). This is very small in a highly industrialized country (the number of farmers in Japan in 1910 decreased to 48% of the national population). Comparing this with the UK's net import of wheat accounting for 80% of total consumption, Germany's accounting for 44%, Italy's accounting for 30%, and France's accounting for 22%, they cannot be compared. The population density in Japan proper is 396 people per square mile, and in Korea it is 230 people. According to the 1926 Chinese postal statistics, Jiangsu has 896 people per square mile. Most of the Chinese immigrants to Manchuria come from Shandong and Hebei. Shandong has 614 people per square mile, and Hebei has 335 people. Only 15% of the Japanese immigrants in Manchuria come from Japan proper, and the rest are Koreans. The area of Korea is equal to the sum of Shandong and Hebei, and its population is half of Shandong Province. China should at least have the right to enjoy all the first opportunities in Manchuria. If China is willing to share its surplus with foreign immigrants and allow them to settle here, they can only do so under Chinese law and Chinese administration. Japan has been boasting about the success of the South Manchurian Railway because of the recent prosperity of Chinese immigrants in Manchuria. In fact, most of the Chinese immigrants go to North Manchuria, which is completely under Chinese administration. According to the estimate of American Walter Young, in the first half of 1927, 200,000 Chinese immigrants went to South Manchuria, accounting for 32% of the population there, and 432,000 went to North Manchuria, accounting for 68% of the total. Even in the South Manchurian immigrant area, it is still under Chinese administration. The railway area under Japanese influence is only a narrow strip and cannot accommodate so many people. Even if the large number of our immigrants to the South Manchuria frontier is due to the railway, it should be known that the South Manchurian Railway was not built by the Japanese but was seized from the Russians by force. The Japanese have created many incidents in Manchuria, interfered with China's construction of railways and development of Manchuria, and obstructed the development of Manchuria. What merit do they have to boast about? In short, Manchuria is a part of China's entire territory, and China is the legitimate owner of Manchuria. How China uses Manchuria is none of their business. If a country can use overpopulation as an excuse to occupy another country's territory, then the United States with a smaller population and Australia with a more sparse population will one day be forced to open up to accommodate the people of other countries. From the Manchurian Incident to the Shanghai Incident, the Japanese army's mad actions have not been slightly curbed. China did not adopt a policy of non-resistance. The Japanese government, intimidated by the military's tyranny, only follows the military's lead and hurriedly tries to cover it up and defend it afterwards. The League of Nations, because Japan does not accept advice and insists on its own way, does not dare to openly rebuke it. The countries of the world are deeply afraid of being drawn into the whirlpool and do not want to displease the great powers, so they ignore the obligations of the League of Nations Covenant, stand by with their hands folded, and remain silent. Moreover, some of the world's comments worship power and have been poisoned by Japan's propaganda, even speaking in favor of Japan, saying that China has repeatedly provoked Japan, leading to this incident, as if the Japanese had intentionally invaded, and without China giving them an opportunity, they would have no excuse. It was not until Japan expanded its military operations, invaded Shanghai, and harmed the interests of various countries that they suddenly realized and tried to slightly restrain the Japanese military's ambitions. Once the crisis in the concessions passed, they still ignored it. If the League of Nations had fulfilled its duties at the beginning of the incident, clearly condemning Japan's actions without any prevarication, even if Japan had not completely obeyed the orders of the League of Nations, it would have restrained itself somewhat due to moral constraints and would not have been as unscrupulous as it is today. If the League of Nations is afraid that it does not have enough power to implement its decisions, it should also use a fearless spirit to issue a clear judgment on the Manchurian case in its capacity as a judge. In this way, the League of Nations can be said to have made every effort to fulfill its duties, maintain its dignity, and declare itself innocent to the world. Now, quoting the words of Japan's recent reply to the League of Nations, 'Facts are louder than empty words.' Is there still any doubt that the Japanese action is a violation of the League of Nations Covenant, even if it is arguing about the distinction between war and undeclared war? The Japanese invasion of Manchuria has been going on for six months. This situation cannot be tolerated for a moment. The Japanese army should immediately withdraw from Manchuria in compliance with the resolutions that Japan has agreed to. The land should be returned to whoever it was taken from. Manchuria should be restored to its original state. Then, the Sino-Japanese dispute should be submitted to the International Court of Justice for public adjudication. China welcomes this opportunity to make the truth of Sino-Japanese relations public to the world so that it can be properly resolved."</p>
<p>[P Recent Situation of the Frontline Japanese Army</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Suzhou on the 29th reports that Luodian is the main town of Maoshan County, and an important automobile route from Shanghai to Taicang. Japanese command headquarters have been established at the automobile station and Xinqiao, each with a garrison of 260 soldiers. There are many Chinese traitors. The automobile route from Luodian to Baoshan City is open. The bridges along the route from Liujia Lane and Gujia Bridge to Baoshan City have also been repaired. The drivers are all Chinese traitors. There are 500 to 600 Korean soldiers stationed at Ludu Bridge, and they occasionally shoot civilians. At 8:00 a.m. on the 28th, a team of Japanese soldiers opened fire in front of the Yue Wang Temple in Yue Wang City as a show of force, and then Japanese sentries at Güzhü Bridge and Xinmü Bridge in Pailou City fired random volleys, but it was only a show of force and they did not dare to advance.</p>

[L Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Taxpayers' Association Protests Japanese Military Parade</p>
<p>▲ Activities of These Unstable Forces</p>
<p>▲ Will Prevent the Return to Normalcy</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the General Manager of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that we have received reports of a Japanese military parade in the North Sichuan Road and Hongkou area today. Has this been authorized or understood by the authorities? Our association believes that the activities of these unstable forces in the Public Concession will further prevent the return to normalcy, not only delaying its return. As it concerns the revival and maintenance of commerce and prosperity, our association hereby lodges a protest and requests that you investigate and promptly prevent these unstable forces from continuing to exist and operate, so as to prevent the restoration of public order in the concession." The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Shanghai Municipal Government, today the Japanese army, under the pretext of celebrating the Emperor's Birthday, actually held a parade in the North Sichuan Road area of the Public Concession, which has never happened before. At a time when the ceasefire negotiations are underway, this kind of action with demonstrative significance is most likely to cause misunderstandings and arouse resentment. We request that your government lodge a protest to appease the people." The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reverently stated, etc. At the same time, a letter was sent to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, requesting them to immediately dissuade them.

<p>▲ Tea Party at Wanglu</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and his wife invited Madam Xiao De and Mr. Edmond to a tea party at Wanglu on Hague Road from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. yesterday, and also invited Mr. and Mrs. Guo Dehua, Tang Haian, Shen De　, Zheng Lai, Mr. and Mrs. Guo Taiqi, etc., and Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and others to entertain them, in order to connect with each other.</p>
<p>The *Continental Daily* reported that Madam Xiao De denied yesterday that the Japanese had acted inappropriately when she passed through Yokohama, Japan, on this trip. She said that the Japanese reporters and photographers gathered on the ship to take pictures of her, but she politely declined. She then returned to her cabin at the ship owner's suggestion to avoid the noise, and only came out of the cabin after the Japanese reporters left the ship. She wished to correct the mistaken impression that she was ridiculed by the Japanese, which had arisen outside.</p>
<h3>The University Joint Association Issues a Declaration</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of University Students in this city, in view of the urgent situation, is working and preparing for the May Commemoration. It specially initiated a joint meeting of various Shanghai organizations, and yesterday issued a declaration saying: "Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese imperialists have been relentlessly attacking. The entire Northeast has been swallowed up, and even Shanghai has been ravaged. Their ambition knows no limit. The government is willing to sell out national interests and has no determination to resist imperialism. It even accepts the unreasonable demands of Japanese imperialists. It sits idly by while the Northeast Volunteer Army and the 19th Route Army are fighting hard against the enemy for several months without any sign of support. Under these circumstances, how should our people rise up to resist in order to achieve the ultimate goal of thorough national liberation? However, in the past few months, due to the government's unwarranted oppression, the national spirit has suddenly declined, and there has been no significant practical work performance. This is extremely painful. It must be known that the government issues illegal orders to surrender, and the people make reasonable resistance to seek liberation, even at the cost of death. What hesitation can there be? We hope that all our people will rise up in time and make persistent efforts to carry out the original intention of vowing to resist Japan to the death. At this critical moment of survival, when the May Commemoration, with its great historical significance, is about to arrive, our people should work hard to rise up and continue the struggle to achieve the effect of collective wisdom and strength."</p>
<h3>Statement of Citizens on North Szechuan Road Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's Announcement</h3>
<p>▲ The Shanghai Municipal Council, upholding justice, should warn the Japanese side</p>
<p>▲ Regarding past events, responsibility must be shouldered</p>
<p>The 17th District Branch of the North Szechuan Road Citizens' Association yesterday issued a solemn statement regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's announcement, saying: "The Shanghai Municipal Council hopes that Shanghai's commerce will recover as soon as possible. Therefore, the Council's Intelligence Department recently issued an important statement. The statement aims at irresponsible Chinese who have repeatedly assaulted Japanese civilians, which is sufficient to undermine the public security of the International Settlement. It hopes that the Chinese press can use its influence to persuade all residents to refrain from further attacks. From the Municipal Council's standpoint, it has to make this statement based on facts. From the standpoint of our Chinese taxpayers, we cannot but express sympathy with the Municipal Council's hope and do our best to stop this unconscious private fight. However, since the night of January 28th, when the Japanese army used guns to bombard Zhabei, the International Settlement north of the Suzhou Creek has been transformed into a Japanese military base. The arbitrary arrest and killing of Chinese taxpayers within the Settlement are countless. Even Westerners have been beaten or detained by the Japanese army in no small number. For example, the American Vice-Consul, the American Commercial Officer, the beautiful Professor Miss Marot, the American Boy Johnson, the Englishman Parks, and Mrs. Rieslan. The Japanese army has also occupied police stations, disarmed police officers, and committed other illegal acts. From this, it can be inferred that Japanese civilians are certainly not as easily deceived as the Municipal Council claims. Even if there are such cases, they must be the result of Japanese provocations or intimidation. Therefore, if the Municipal Council hopes to restore Shanghai's commerce, it must do its best to eliminate the unstable conditions that hinder the restoration of Shanghai's commerce. Otherwise, the Municipal Council's dedication to so-called irresponsible Chinese to maintain security will not satisfy Chinese taxpayers. Since the Municipal Council has solemnly declared that it treats all residents within the Settlement equally, regardless of Chinese or foreign, it should uphold justice and exercise its authority to formally and earnestly warn the Japanese authorities and Japanese residents, order them to bear the responsibility for past events, and order them to be responsible for guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. At the same time, it should persuade the Chinese. Only in this way can it be fair and meaningful. Now, it does not do this. It ignores the unprecedentedly brutal acts, almost tacitly acknowledging them. It does not say a word of warning about the lawless behavior of Japanese ruffians and plainclothes men in the Hongkou area, but focuses on the actions of one or two unconscious Chinese, exaggerating the matter and threatening them with harm. It seems that the Municipal Council's police power can only reach the Chinese people and absolutely cannot reach the Japanese people. This kind of view is unfair. We sincerely hope that the responsible members of the Municipal Council will give it more consideration so that the weight of justice will not be lost entirely. This is what we hope for."</p>
<h3>Citizens on North Szechuan Road Appeal for Exemption from Municipal General Tax</h3>
<p>The 17th District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Association yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, saying: "Since the tragic incident that occurred in this port on January 28th, the suffering has been unprecedented. The losses of our merchants and residents on North Szechuan Road have been the greatest. The reason is that the Settlement authorities, without considering the consequences, designated the International Settlement north of the Suzhou Creek as a Japanese military defense zone, creating an unprecedented hell on earth. In the past two months, nine out of ten houses have been emptied, and there is no sound of chickens or dogs. The streets are deserted. Among the Chinese taxpayers within the Settlement, some have lost their wives and children, some have been injured, and many more have lost all their property. Recently, feeling that it is not a long-term solution to be displaced and sleeping in the open, they have reluctantly returned one after another, only to find a desolate scene, bare walls, and constant danger. They have no time to make a living, let alone restore business. Therefore, regarding the police tax for the spring and summer seasons and the significant losses suffered by Chinese taxpayers this time, your Association's representatives have made a serious representation to the Municipal Council, but two weeks have passed without a clear response. The Municipal Council is still proceeding with the tax collection. If this continues, it will easily lead to disputes. We hereby request your Association to make a formal statement so that we can comply accordingly. This is what we hope for."</p>
<h3>Hongkou Merchants and Residents Hold Joint Representative Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Telegraph the National Government not to surrender due to the ceasefire</p>
<p>▲ Send a letter to the Ratepayers Association to negotiate for tax exemption again</p>
<p>The branch associations of the Citizen's United Association in Hongkou, Yangshupu Road, Jiaxing Road, Broadway Road, Haining Road, Suzhou Road, North Shansi Road, Ward Road, Yinxiang West Ward Road, North Tibet Road, Hansbury Road, Endicott Road, and other business associations held an emergency meeting at 4 p.m. yesterday. Wang Rongtang, Zhang Xianfang, and other representatives, a total of 40 odd people, attended. The resolutions are recorded separately below: (1) Regarding the absurd remarks of Japanese residents to establish Jiangwan, Wusong, and other areas as settlements, it was resolved to issue a telegram demanding that the government implement resistance and not surrender to the humiliating ceasefire conference to expose their treachery. (2) It was resolved to send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association to protest to the Municipal Council, implement tax exemption, and refute the biased remarks of the Municipal Council. (3) It was resolved to send a letter to the Citizen's United Association stating that Hongkou is not yet a safe area and does not dare to open the market hastily. The news that Hongkou will open the market on May 1st is completely inaccurate. (4) The request of the tenants of the Tai'an Li in North Shansi Road to fulfill the three-month rent exemption was approved for negotiation after the report by the 15th branch of the Citizen's United Association. (5) The report by the 10th branch of the Citizen's United Association regarding the situation of the landlord Yixing Company in Tongzhou Road, which increased the rent of Yixing Li, Yida, and other four houses unsuccessfully and resorted to coercion and eviction, was approved for assistance to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Association Petitions Today</h3>
<p>▲ Request a prompt official order for rent reduction and exemption</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Movement Committee, based on the resolution of the representatives' meeting, decided to send representatives Yu Hualong, Zhang Yimo, and others to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Department today to petition for an official order for rent reduction and exemption. The original petition is recorded below: It is presented for the war disaster affecting people's livelihood, the painful commercial depression, and the economic recession. We request rent reduction and exemption to adjust and maintain people's livelihood, and hope that you will review the matter and promptly issue an official order for implementation. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to the national revolution, and his main purpose was to improve people's livelihood and promote the Great Harmony of human society. Since the invasion of Shanghai by the tyrannical Japanese, all industries have stagnated, residents have lost their jobs, and the social economy has been destroyed. In the areas affected by the war, property has been destroyed, families have been separated, and people are suffering from hunger and cold. Their suffering is unspeakable. We have witnessed the tragic situation and pray from the bottom of our hearts. Now that the war has come to an end, the various dangers have subsided slightly, but the suffering of the citizens has not been resolved, and the social economy has not been stabilized. It is impossible to restore the old appearance overnight. The citizens of this city, after surviving the catastrophe, have learned from the pain, endured humiliation, and opened the market to barely maintain the current situation. They have reduced their clothing and food, worked hard, and encouraged themselves to struggle to prolong their lives and engage in revitalization. However, the rent remains the same as before, which is tantamount to being shackled. Those below the middle class are frowning and distressed, and even well-to-do families feel it difficult to cope. Even large merchants and magnates cannot avoid being affected by business and unable to maintain their operations. All these situations are the real situation of the tenants at present, and the landlords should also regard them as endless hidden worries. Therefore, rent reduction and exemption are to adjust the social economy, liberate the people's suffering, and also to benefit the landlords. In terms of law, during the emergency of the war, all merchants and residents in the city, regardless of safety, were panicked and could not spend the night peacefully. They moved and fled in droves, resulting in the inability to use or benefit from the entire or part of the leased goods due to reasons beyond their control. Therefore, the request for reduction and exemption is permitted by law. Furthermore, it has been found that rent reduction has been officially ordered in both Beijing and Hangzhou, while Shanghai, which has directly suffered damage, should of course temporarily reduce and exempt rent. The purpose of co-existence and co-prosperity is to promote various opinions on a broad scale and to formulate specific reduction and exemption methods for the actual situation in each district. The proposal has been unanimously approved by the representatives' meeting. However, most of the landlords hold high expectations and understand righteousness, but there are also not a few who seek only profit and disregard justice. For this reason, we have enclosed a copy of the rent reduction and exemption methods by district and presented the facts for your review. We humbly ask you to consider the suffering of the people and the situation of prosperity, and promptly issue an official announcement for implementation in order to benefit the people's livelihood and promote justice. We await your orders with utmost anticipation. [P Tomorrow is Labor Day</p>
<p>▲ The Chinese and foreign authorities are especially on guard</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the May 1st Labor Day. The Public Security Bureau of this city and the police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have jointly implemented special precautions to prevent and guard against it. It is reported that the Municipal Public Security Bureau has ordered the entire supervisory department, inspectors, investigators, and female inspectors to set off to various places to conduct strict reconnaissance. All members of the bureau's detective team have also gone to various roads to patrol, and temporary guards have been assigned to key intersections and traffic institutions to implement inspections on suspicious pedestrians to maintain public order.</p>
<h3>British Chamber of Commerce President Marshall Re-elected</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the new directors of the British Chamber of Commerce held a board meeting at the British Consulate yesterday and elected Marshall to continue as president. After the meeting, the board of the China Association was convened and elected Mr. Kim and Mr. Booker as president and vice president.</p>
<h3>Two Important Telegrams from the Silver and Coinage Guild</h3>
<p>▲ Abolish the Prohibition of Silver Export to the National Government in Nanjing</p>
<p>To President Wang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance: It is found that the transport of silver dollars is closely related to the circulation of goods. The export of local products from various places depends on the transport of silver dollars to the interior, while in the commercial ports where goods are imported, silver dollars are transported out so that the lack or surplus can be adjusted and the financial lifeline can run smoothly without obstruction. Since the Northeast Incident, followed by the Shanghai war, various places have banned the export of silver, especially Hunan and Shantou, resulting in the loss of normal adjustment. In an instant, local products from various places appeared on the market. Once silver dollars are transported to the interior, it is difficult to transport them out. Merchants are afraid to do so and must keep cash in hand. Not only is the economy of the interior greatly restricted, but the impact on tax revenue is also significant. The financial circulation is related to the national economy and should be coordinated and adjusted by the central government. It cannot be allowed for each province to act independently, resulting in the obstruction of the circulation of goods throughout the country. We request that your esteemed Yuan (Ministry) promptly issue a telegram to all provinces to abolish the prohibition uniformly so that goods from various places can be transported and sold without obstruction, with a view to the early recovery of the national market. The Shanghai Banking Association and the Coinage Association respectfully request.</p>
<p>▲ Cancel the Increase in Postal Rates to the National Government in Nanjing</p>
<p>To the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications: It is now stated by the united voice of banks and money shops of the enemy that the Ministry of Communications recently increased postal rates from May 1st in order to compensate for postal losses and subsidize aviation. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has presented a request to maintain the old postal rates because the increase in postal rates in remote provinces has greatly hindered cultural development, but it has not been approved. It is found that the impact of the increase in postal rates for the main registered letters, express deliveries, and other items is not limited to the relationship of remote provinces as claimed by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The financial and commercial affairs of places with convenient transportation are also very important. Banks and money shops have a large volume of mail, mainly registered letters and express deliveries. The increase in postal rates will result in greater losses. In addition, merchants mostly remit small amounts of money. The remittance fee for amounts under ten yuan is at most two jiao in neighboring provinces, while the double-registered or express postal fee for mailing remittance letters under the new regulations is as much as two jiao and six fen, far exceeding the remittance fee. In the case of banks and money shops, the postal fee is borne by the bank or money shop, and the customer can ignore it. However, in the case of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, the postal fee must be paid by the remitter, which is tantamount to indirectly increasing the remittance fee, which is harmful to both merchants and the people. We request that you coordinate with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to vigorously strive for the cancellation of the postal rate increase by the government. It is stated that state-owned postal services also emphasize revenue, but not mainly to obtain profits, but to charge handling fees. All income rates naturally increase based on economic development, population reproduction, and cultural progress. Therefore, in principle, postal rates can only be reduced and not increased. For example, the Japanese postal service once attempted to increase postal rates due to financial constraints, but it was rejected by public opinion and stopped because the increase in postal rates is related to the people's livelihood and national economy of a country. It is now stated by the banks and money shops of the enemy that the previous situation is that the increase in postal rates has increased losses for banks and money shops, and is also detrimental to the Savings and Remittance Bureau in various ways. By increasing the burden on small remitting individuals, the purpose of postal remittance is lost, which is detrimental to both the country and society. Considering the original intention of the rate increase, it should not be so. The date of the rate increase is imminent, and all parties are calling for it urgently. We hereby send a telegram requesting that you consider the difficulties of banks and money shops and all parties, and comprehensively plan to maintain the old postal rates uniformly, regardless of convenient transportation or remote provinces. It will be a public convenience. The Shanghai Banking Association and the Coinage Association respectfully request.</p>
<h3>The Guangdong Compatriots Association Was Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Wu Tiecheng, Mai Chaochu, and others are the Presidium</p>
<p>Guangdong people Wu Tiecheng, Mai Chaochu, Ma Chaojun, Chen Fumu, and others initiated the unified Guangdong Compatriots Association, which was officially established at the Central Society on Weihaiwei Road at 4 p.m. yesterday. There were 135 representatives present. At 12 noon, the first meeting of directors was held to elect a presidium of nine people. The details of the two meetings are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The meeting of directors was attended by 38 people. Gao Chongyuan was publicly elected as the chairman. The chairman reported that today is the first meeting of directors. Several people should be nominated as the presidium for today's establishment meeting. He requested an on-the-spot public election. The directors elected nine people as the presidium: Wu Tiecheng, Mai Chaochu, Zheng Hongnian, Ma Chaojun, Wen Zongyao, Wu Chengyu, Mai Zuoheng, Guo Shun, Liu Weichi, and Liu Xiquan. It was also decided that the second meeting of directors would be held at the association at 7:30 p.m. next Tuesday. After the establishment of the association, a public letter would be sent to notify all the hometown associations to be handled by the general affairs department.</p>
<p>▲ The establishment meeting was held at 4 p.m. 135 people attended the establishment meeting. First, Chairman Wen Zongyao reported that today is the day of the establishment of the Guangdong Compatriots Association, which has been registered with the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau. It is a formal organization. There are more than 300,000 Guangdong people in Shanghai. The previous organizations in Shanghai included the Guangzhao Public Office, the Commercial Federation, and other Zhongshan and Nanhai Hometown Associations, which were only local organizations. Therefore, the provincial hometown association should have been established earlier. Recently, due to the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, our commercial losses in Shanghai have been particularly large. Compared with the complete organization of other hometown associations, we are ashamed. Because we did not have a clear registration before, we could not investigate, so we do not know how much the losses are. Now that this association is established, we hope that the fellow countrymen will unite and share this personal work. Therefore, we also hope that everyone will share the development of this association for the relief of fellow countrymen who are out of school and unemployed. Then Gao Guangjing reported on the preparation process. Finally, Chairman Zheng Hongnian of the Presidium gave a speech (details omitted). Then, they shouted slogans and took a group photo. The tea party ended at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>The Shallow Water Fee for the Hanyi Line is Halved</h3>
<p>▲ Effective May 1st</p>
<p>On the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, from Hankou to Yichang, the water level sharply decreases every winter, and deep-draft river vessels cannot sail directly, resulting in the goods loaded in Yichang having to be transferred to smaller boats after arriving in Hankou. The procedures are cumbersome, and the expenses are relatively large. Therefore, since last winter, the goods transported to Yichang have been charged an additional 50% shallow water fee based on the original price. Currently, the water level on the line has risen slightly, and river vessels can sail directly. Yesterday, China Merchants, Jardine, and other six companies decided to reduce the shallow water fee on the Hanyi line by 25% from May 1st. The remaining 25% will be cancelled when the water level returns to normal.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Primary Schools to Propagate Communism</h3>
<p>▲ Sending female comrades to lure wounded soldiers to school</p>
<p>▲ Distributing rice coupons to provide small favors to workers</p>
<p>▲ Also publishing a reactionary publication</p>
<p>▲ 14 people involved were arrested yesterday</p>
<p>The Huimeng Primary School at No. 1163 MacGinnis Road, Shanghai West, was founded by Chen. There were not many students. Since the September 18th Incident last year, when the Northeast was occupied by the Japanese army, Chen also followed the trend and organized an anti-Japanese association in the school, using the name of anti-Japanese to spread communism. When the January 28th Shanghai War broke out, Chen saw that factories were closed and workers were unemployed, so he gave small favors and distributed rice coupons to lure them. Seeing that there were many wounded soldier hospitals, he falsely claimed to be comforting and sent so-called female comrades to the wounded soldier hospitals to lure the wounded soldiers who had resisted Japan to join his illegal organization. He also published a reactionary publication and secretly printed various leaflets to distribute them. Over time, the Gordon Road Police Station discovered it. The Chinese and foreign detectives Zhang Jinlong and Wang Jie secretly went to the school on May 5th and 6th to search. However, the mastermind Chen had already heard the news and fled. Only Li Xiuzhen, a female student from Sichuan, Fan Weixin, a male student from Guizhou, Wang Hanqing from Nanjing, Liang Tianwo and Xie Xin from Fujian, Zhu Zhaoqi from Guangdong, Zhao Zisheng, a wounded soldier from Shandong, Wang Jinsheng, Zhang Zhizhen, and Xing Haiqing from Anhui, Su Jinshi and Chen Xiaoerzi, small workers from Jiangbei, and Zhao Guangzu and Shi Rende from Shaoxing, a total of 14 people, were arrested along with the leaflets and sent to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The police station prosecuted each defendant for the crime of internal disorder. Shi Rende was also charged with bribing public officials because he offered five yuan in silver to a Chinese police officer at No. 259 in an attempt to buy his release after his arrest. The Criminal Court President Yu Hua, together with two judges and a prosecutor, opened the trial in the court yesterday. Some of the defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Zheng Wenkai to defend them, while others were unable to hire lawyers and were assigned lawyers by the court. First, the police station lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case. Then, Mrs. Wang Zhang, the second landlord of Huimeng School, testified. The woman said that the lower floor of Huimeng was rented by Chen and has only been half a year. The upper floor is still rented by me to other tenants. On the fifth of last month, I happened to go to collect the rent from the tenants on the upper floor, so I witnessed the arrest of Li Xiuzhen and others. At that time, Li ran to the upper floor because the people living on the upper floor did not know each other, so they refused to let her go upstairs. Because I do not live in the house, I am not aware of the contents of the school. According to Li Xiuzhen's confession, she had been officially dealt with twice before on suspicion of reactionary activities. This time, she went to the school to visit a friend but did not meet him. She was about to leave when she was arrested and denied any relationship with the Communist Party. Zhao Zisheng confessed that he was a soldier of the 19th Route Army. He was injured in the Battle of Zhabei and sent to the hospital for treatment. On March 5th, three women brought goods to the hospital to comfort him. When his injury was about to heal, the woman insisted on inviting him out of the hospital to play with him and even asked the nurse on his behalf. He went out with her, and when he arrived at the school, the woman left and asked him to stay for a while. He was soon arrested. He still does not know what the purpose of inviting him to the school was. Wang Jinsheng confessed that he was arrested for going to the school to buy the newspaper it published. The four defendants, Su, Chen, Zhang, and Xing, all claimed that they were arrested for going to the school to beg for rice coupons. The rest claimed that they were arrested for visiting friends. Finally, Shi repeatedly denied the bribery incident. The president of the court ordered the police to take the defendants away and detain them separately to await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Kidnappers in Jiashan</h3>
<p>▲ The kidnapped victim is still missing</p>
<p>Gao Liansheng and Gao Lianfa, two nephews of Luo Yuangui, a resident of Ganzhi Town, Jiashan, were suddenly kidnapped by several bandits on March 12 this year.

<h3>Departmental Order: Liquor and Tobacco Licenses are Difficult to Exempt</h3>
<p>The Chongqi Tobacco and Liquor License Tax Branch of Shangbao County received instruction No. 30 from the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Liquor Tax Bureau yesterday. The instruction stated that the Ministry of Finance had issued instruction No. 15 of the Jia character, ordering that the Shanghai Spirits, Shaoxing Wine, Fen Wine, Western Tobacco, and Tobacco Leaf Associations submit petitions requesting that the summer license taxes for Shangbao County be waived due to the impact of the war on business stagnation, and ordering the Shangbao Chongqi Tobacco and Liquor License Tax Collection Branch to comply.

<h3>Traffic Interrupted in Jitong</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Between Volunteers and Japanese Troops</p>
<p>Changchun: The Japanese military authorities here received a report this morning that 1,000 guerrillas were approaching Tonghua. A troop of soldiers was dispatched from Jilin to intercept them.

<h3>Heihe Still in Japanese Hands</h3>
<p>Xie Ke Arrested by the Japanese; Japanese Suspicions of Traitors</p>
<p>Beiping: A person from Heilongjiang Province said that Ma Zhanshan previously defended the besieged city alone and, in order to preserve his strength, made a deal with the Japanese, hoping to obtain a huge sum of money for anti-Japanese military expenses. When the investigation team came to China, they indicated that the Director of Finance, Pang Zuoping, and the General Manager of the Guan Yinhao, Ma Gengnian, should resign and secretly transport over 500,000 yuan in cash from the treasury to Heihe, expecting to obtain 15 million yuan, but it failed due to some reason.

After Ma's rebellion, the Japanese became more suspicious of traitors. Zhang Jinghui and others are all being held under Japanese guard. Even Zhao Xinbo, who had been raised for many years, was detained twice.

<p>Talks with Diplomatic Authorities</p>
<p>[P Shen Jinding, Acting for Luo, Meets with Reporters</p>
<p>Nanjing: Shen Jinding, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met with reporters in Beijing at 11:00 AM on the 29th on behalf of Minister Luo and discussed the following:</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai ceasefire conference continued yesterday with an informal meeting. A compromise proposal put forward by the British Minister was adopted and a draft agreement was being prepared. It is expected that a conclusion will be reached soon. However, our opinion must wait until the 19-member committee of the League of Nations passes a resolution at its general meeting on the 30th before a formal meeting can be held.</p>
<p>(2) The puppet government's reception of the League of Nations Investigation Team: The puppet government has been working to receive the League of Nations Investigation Team. For the convenience of the investigation, the investigation team has made some indications to the puppet government. However, this is merely a personal exchange between Sir Lytton and Xie Jieshi, and does not constitute recognition of the existence of the so-called Manchukuo or any other status.</p>
<p>(3) China-Soviet relations: It is rumored that the Soviet Union intends to recognize the puppet government as a counterpart for business negotiations. If this were to happen, it would violate its stated policy of neutrality. Our country's foreign policy is to connect with nations around the world that treat us as equals. If the Soviet Union were to show sincerity in this regard, we would give it a favorable consideration regarding the resumption of diplomatic relations. However, the resumption of diplomatic relations does not mean recognition of communism. This goes without saying.</p>
<p>(4) The Japanese military's acts of aggression: Reports have been received from various parties in recent days that Japanese aircraft have repeatedly flown over the Suzhou and Hangzhou areas. The Ministry has repeatedly protested to the Japanese Minister to China. Furthermore, according to reports from the customs authorities, the Japanese military has interfered with the customs' duties on the Jinghu Railway. Although the customs authorities have protested to the Japanese side, the Japanese military authorities continue to obstruct them. The Ministry is planning a response to make the Japanese military aware that such acts of aggression should not be repeated. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>

It is expected that after the National Representative Assembly decides to convene, the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan will be produced by the Assembly and will no longer need to be elected. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Shao Yuanchong said that at the Central Political Council meeting on the 29th, the members exchanged opinions on the convening of the National Representative Assembly. The general opinion was that a public opinion body must be established, but it is still necessary to consider whether the name "National Representative Assembly" should be used. Because the convening of the National Representative Assembly stipulated in the Founding Outline must be convened at the beginning of constitutional government, the use of the name "National Representative Assembly" at this time may conflict with the future National Representative Assembly. Secondly, it is also necessary to consider aspects of the election, such as preventing improper campaigning. Therefore, in addition to exchanging opinions today, there was no resolution. Another meeting will be held next week to study the issue, and a draft plan can be drafted after the principles are decided. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>The US Secretary of State is Expected to Delay His Return Home</p>
<p>Tejedor Cancels Trip to Geneva</p>
<p>Penco Denies Diplomatic Significance</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, April 28th, National News Agency - Diplomatic circles here</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Expressed disappointment and criticized France yesterday. After the adjournment of the Five-Power Conference, they are slightly more optimistic today. Many parties indicate that they are carefully considering the situation, which is not as bad as initially thought. Tonight's news indicates that various parties are working hard to continue talks between the leaders of major powers, hoping to open a path to global economic recovery. British Prime Minister MacDonald took the lead in proposing a solution. According to reliable sources, MacDonald has been able to persuade all relevant parties to agree to reopen negotiations at the earliest opportunity. This afternoon, French representative Penco visited British Prime Minister MacDonald and assured him that Tejedor also eagerly wanted to continue discussions, but was unfortunately unable to come to Geneva before May 9th. The situation has suddenly taken a turn for the better. At the same time, the French delegation is also doing its utmost to deny that Tejedor's cancellation of his trip to Geneva contains diplomatic elements, firmly asserting that Tejedor has not changed his original intention, but is only prevented by a sore throat from attending the meeting, and that Tejedor has never shied away from difficulties and has never lacked the courage to deal with enemies. Finally, Stimson, White, and the Italian representative Schiavo Giordani all seemed to accept the French delegation's defense. White agreed to stay in Geneva until Saturday and will meet here tomorrow with the French Ambassador Hoetz to hear his report on the French government's attitude. US representative Stimson is also expected to delay his return home and return to Geneva after a vacation in the Italian Riviera. Tonight, at a dinner hosted by Stimson for MacDonald, White, Schiavo Giordani, Penco, and other dignitaries, a practical agreement was reached on the spot, but it was a private conversation, and the issues discussed were not disclosed afterwards.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, April 29th, National News Agency - After the suspension of the Geneva Conference, German political and journalistic circles are extremely disappointed. However, the government authorities are currently making every effort to ease the situation. The government claims that the Geneva Conference has not broken down and that although it is temporarily suspended, it is expected to reopen soon. Furthermore, considering the current state of the conference, Germany has no need to be disappointed, because the principle of equality that Germany demanded would have been almost impossible to discuss two years ago, but now it has been accepted by the conference. Both Britain and the United States have expressed understanding and sympathy towards Germany. Moreover, regarding the issue of reparations, Germany's inability to continue making payments is extremely clear, so the countries concerned have already begun preparations for a solution based on this view. The setting of the date for the Lausanne Conference, etc., can all be regarded as victories that Germany has already achieved in Geneva.</p>
<h3>As the French General Election Approaches, All Parties Publish Platforms</h3>
<p>▲ Paris, April 28th, National News Agency - With only three days left until the French general election, the major parties in the Chamber of Deputies have only just published their platforms as usual. However, half of the 2,500 candidates have not yet officially announced their political views. The platforms that have been published are mostly old articles advocating disarmament, opposing changes to education policy, cutting government spending, providing unemployment relief, reducing taxes, and simplifying procedures. There are no new proposals sufficient to renew the government's domestic and foreign policies, nor are there many that can form the basis for enacting new legislation. Therefore, this general election will still be based on party affiliation as the standard for voting.</p>

<h3>Former Argentine President Dies</h3>

<p>▲ Athens, April 29th, National News Agency - The British, French, and Italian ministers jointly protested to the Greek government today against the suspension of payment of principal and interest on international loans under the auspices of the League of Nations.

As soon as Greece receives the financial assistance promised by the League of Nations regarding the interruption of Tejedor's trip to Geneva, it will immediately resume payment.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The United States is Willing to Supply Weapons to Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>▲ In order to restrain Japan</p>
<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun, Washington Special Telegram - Recently, the issue of the United States recognizing Soviet Russia has attracted widespread attention from the general public. The motivation stems from the deteriorating situation between Japan and Russia. A majority of senators in the US Senate believe that in the event of a conflict between Japan and Russia, the United States should be in a position to supply weapons to both sides. "Even if the United States does not recognize Soviet Russia, it will not necessarily refuse to supply weapons." This view has been expressed unofficially among senators. They are also strongly urging President Hoover to make a decision. However, Hoover only supports the political organization of the Soviet Russian government regarding the recognition issue, and does not seem to dare to agree to it within a broad scope. However, the movement to recognize Soviet Russia in the US Senate is gradually leaning towards a resolution. The Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, and other influential senators believe that the form of the treaty of commerce and debt settlement should be handled by the President himself. Therefore, based on the current situation, although there is no urgent possibility of the United States recognizing Soviet Russia, it is generally recognized that providing weapons to Russia to restrain Japan and avoid a break between Japan and Russia is the right course of action.</p>
<h3>Asahi Shimbun on Soviet Russia and Manchuria</h3>
<p>▲ Claiming that Soviet Russia's policies are fickle</p>
<p>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, 20th, commentary on the relationship between Soviet Russia and Manchuria: "The current demand by the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs of Soviet Russia to replace the Chinese consul in Hailar and prohibit the consul from sending coded telegrams, and the apparent intention to recognize the government of Manchukuo, are indeed gratifying to us. Recalling the history of Sino-Russian relations, in May of the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924), the two countries concluded diplomatic relations. In April of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), during the Zhang Zuolin era, the Soviet Russian embassy was suddenly searched, leading to the restoration of the severance of diplomatic relations. In December of the same year, the Guangdong government, angered by the activities of the Communist Party, also severed relations with Soviet Russia. Afterwards, although Mo Teh-hui visited Moscow, there has been no possibility of restoring diplomatic relations to this day. This time, Soviet Russia suddenly demanded the replacement of the consul in Hailar. On the other hand, the Consul General in Harbin, Slavutsky, and the Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Koganayev, recognized Li Shaogeng, the newly appointed Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway by Manchukuo, which almost implicitly recognizes Manchukuo. The reason for this is that the status of the Russian in the Chinese Eastern Railway has greatly changed in accordance with the Sino-Russian Treaty and the Feng-Russian Agreement of eight years ago, and it has become purely a commercial enterprise. Russia has significant interests in Manchuria, so Russia is using this stern measure to prevent the instability of the Chinese border and the instigation of Chinese consuls. Unexpectedly, Russia has recently changed its attitude drastically and turned against Japan. On one hand, the United States has the intention of recognizing Soviet Russia, and it is reported that Stimson and Litvinov will discuss how Russia and the United States will cooperate against Japan. On the other hand, Soviet troops are actively concentrating on the Far Eastern border, and Soviet newspapers are wantonly vilifying Japan. The sudden change in the situation is so different from before that it is truly bewildering. However, we deeply hope that Soviet Russia will understand the situation in Manchuria and maintain peace in the Far East. What is regrettable is that Soviet Russia's foreign policy is fickle, so we can only quietly observe the development of the situation."</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's New Ford Airplane</h3>
<p>▲ Worth US$60,000</p>
<p>Ping News - Zhang Xueliang recently purchased a private airplane from a certain country. On the 23rd, it arrived in Wuhan from Hong Kong, piloted by the American technician Harden. At 9:10 am on the 24th, it took off from Hankou and flew north along the Pinghan Railway. The journey was smooth as it passed through Wushengguan, Zhengzhou, and Zhangde. At 2 pm, it arrived in Baoding, but suddenly there was a drastic change in the weather, and yellow sand blotted out the sky. Looking down from the fuselage, it was impossible to see anything. The pilot Harden persevered and flew north through the haze. At 3 pm, he finally discovered the Yongding River and circled once in the sky over Beiping amidst the howling wind. At 3:30 pm, it landed at the Qinghe Airport. According to the technician Song Hegeng at the airport, the private airplane purchased by Director Zhang is still a product of the Ford factory, and its construction is even more sophisticated than the previous one, costing approximately US$60,000 (approximately 270,000-280,000 silver dollars in national currency). The aircraft can travel 160 miles per hour, which is even faster than the previously purchased aircraft. The top of the aircraft is equipped with a new type of radio that can send and receive telegrams. The aircraft arrived from Hong Kong with a total of four people: the pilot Harden and the consultant Eloldr, as well as the technician KNirs and a technical assistant.</p>
<p>As for the construction of the aircraft, it is a Ford monoplane with a silver body that is extremely beautiful. There are three engines at the head of the aircraft, each wrapped in lead. Each engine has a propeller with blue, red, and white national emblems painted on it. Under the wing is the Ford factory product number 432. The tail is inscribed with the words (Ford) and the numbers TrlMolorNo432H. The fuselage has a radio. The radio can send and receive transmissions when the plane is more than 500 feet in the air. There are small glass windows on the left and right sides of the fuselage. The entrance to the aircraft is on the left side. The interior of the aircraft is very delicate. The interior is carpeted with brown-yellow velvet and has six completely isolated seats made of white velvet with leather covers. When flying, the covers are put on the body to prevent passengers from suffering from bumps. Behind the single seat is a small sofa chair that can accommodate three people. The glass has small golden silk curtains. Behind the small sofa is the luggage compartment. The luggage compartment has compartments with leather straps on each layer to prevent luggage from shaking. Finally, there is a toilet and washroom. The toilet has a Western-style toilet and a washbasin with hot and cold water pipes. The aircraft can carry nine passengers, with two pilots, for a total of eleven people. The pilot's salary is US$1,000 per month, and the technician and assistant also require US$800 per month each. Zhang Xueliang plans to sit in the plane and circle Beiping for a trial ride in a few days (25th).</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick News</h3>
<p>▲ Jing County Town in Southern Anhui Falls to Bandits - The Jing County Association reports that there are several hundred bandits, claiming to be the First Column of the Special Envoy's Office of Western Fujian. The county magistrate initially planned to lead the police force to resist, but then the county residents petitioned to avoid destroying the local area and allowed them to occupy it. The bandits extorted and plundered for three days before organizing and fleeing. The 57th Division stationed in Wuhu urgently dispatched infantry, mortars, and machine gun companies to rush to suppress them.</p>
<p>▲ About 200 members of the Tunxi Self-Defense Corps Mutiny - The battalion commander was killed, and five civilians were killed or injured.

It is reported that the mutineers have fled into the deep mountains. The 57th Division's Yu Fengrun Regiment, stationed in Qi Yuan, has dispatched troops to pursue them nearby.</p>
<p>▲ The Wuhu Garrison Commander - Previously, the position was held by Tan Jingguo, commander of the 171st Brigade of the 57th Division. Now that Tan has been transferred to Datong, Chen Tiaoyuan has appointed Li Songshan, commander of the 57th Division, to concurrently serve as garrison commander, and Zhao Jingshi, director of the Wuhu Public Security Bureau, as deputy commander. Wuhu is still under strict curfew, with troops patrolling the streets every night.</p>
<p>▲ Anhui Agricultural Relief - Due to insufficient funds, it has been decided to conclude operations next month. However, for the sake of permanent mutual assistance in rural areas, cooperative enterprises have been successively organized. There are more than 600 rural mutual aid societies. However, in the disaster-stricken counties and townships, farmers are often filling their stomachs with dirt clods and grass roots during this time when crops are not yet ripe, and the suffering is no less than during the disaster.</p>
<p>▲ When Chen Tiaoyuan governed Anhui, he implemented the public sale of opium. At present, there are no fewer than thousands of opium companies and opium dens openly operating in Wuhu. The number of opium addicts is increasing day by day. The public believes that the harm is unbearable and has requested the Anti-Drug Association to submit petitions to the new provincial government, asking it to resolutely prohibit drugs (27th).</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence - The Black Flag Society in Yishui County, Southern Shandong, previously clashed with civilians, resulting in casualties on both sides. The Black Flag Society gathered a large crowd, and the situation was very tense for a time. Fortunately, Yun Qichang, the brigade commander of the stationed troops, persuaded them to disband. Han Fuju, chairman of the provincial government, considering the ignorance of the people, specially sent Li Shuchun, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, to offer condolences. Li first inspected the Linqu Public Security Bureau, prison, and other places on the 24th.

Today (26th), he took the Jiaoji train to Jinan to report the situation to the provincial government. According to Zhan, the Black Flag Society uprising initially started as a small conflict between the crowd and the district office. The situation expanded due to inadequate mediation, and the crowd gathered to more than 10,000 people. Fortunately, Yun Qichang, the brigade commander of the 243rd Brigade of my unit, peacefully persuaded the crowd to disperse. I also went to the area to suppress and offer condolences once. Director Li Shuchun also arrived in Sucun today (26th) to summon the crowd and offer condolences. The village is currently temporarily stationed by Lin Fengjun's unit of the Third Battalion of the 486th Regiment under Brigade Commander Yun to provide suppression. I came here to report the subsidence of the uprising to the Chairman. (26th)</p>
<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>▲ Notorious Bandit Xue Song and Er Are Captured - Songjiang Correspondence - Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, cases of bandits and thieves taking advantage of the opportunity to steal and plunder have occurred frequently in the interior. Recently, Fan Guozhong, the captain of the First Water Police Team, received secret information that Xu Sijing (aka Xue Song and Er, formerly under Taibao Ashu), who had wreaked havoc in the coastal counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang last year, was hiding near the salt field in Tuolin, a coastal area of this county, recruiting followers in an attempt to revive Taibao's forces and harm the local area. Captain Fan considered that the bandit was originally a wanted criminal and led a team of officers and patrolmen to the area the morning before last to capture the ringleader, Xue Song and Er.

As it passed through the Mizidu, the stationed water police ordered to check the cabin. In a moment of desperation, I shot and killed the patrolman with a pistol in order to escape. The firearms of the Fourth District Public Security Substation in Fengxian were also robbed by me and my accomplices. I planned to sell salt and have already made contact with the gangs in Pudong.

<h3>Financial Standard Gold Prices Turn From High to Low</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday's standard gold price of eleven taels still fluctuated, first rising and then falling. There were eleven price swings throughout the day. Looking back, it finally fell slightly, about two taels. The industry's demand for supply varied. The silver market reported a decline, initially falling out of 730 taels. The foreign exchange rate contracted, and the domestic market fluctuated slightly, causing the gold price to appear complicated. Afterwards, it was reported that Japanese military and political dignitaries were holding a celebration of the Emperor's birthday at Hongkou Park when they were suddenly attacked by a bomb, injuring Shigemitsu, Shirakawa, and others. The market atmosphere deteriorated, fearing that there would be major changes in the situation, so people panicked and sold, causing the price to plummet eight or nine taels, eventually falling to 724 taels. Finally, it eased slightly. The incident was unexpected. The situation of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ The opening price increased by 3.8 taels, opening in June at 3.8 taels higher, at 732.5 taels. The large bars returned 16% to four-fifths. The silver price also contracted by 3/8. The private telegrams were 1/2 less. However, Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yu Hong, Kang Yong, Yifeng, and others all sold. It then retreated two taels to 34.6 taels. Afterwards, Yuanda, Yongyuan, Kangxiang, Fuchang, Yifeng, Yongyu, Hetong, Taichang, and others came to buy, so the price surged more than four taels to 35 taels. At this time, the US dollar only settled at 30.375 yuan, and the British pound at 0.0625, so it could be sold. Soon after, retail investors sold, retreating to 32.3 taels. The British pound was revealed to be contracting by 25, and the US dollar by 375, but the exchange rate was small, so the gold price was not affected and remained at around 33 taels. Continuing for 3.7 taels, Bingxing, Yifeng, Dadecheng, Hengyu, and others sold, and the exchange market was flat. At more than 9:50, it was 31.7 taels. Goods from Yuanheng came in at 10:15, adding 3.2 taels. The June US dollar could be settled at 625, combined with Chen Fengyong and others coming to the market to buy, and it was heard that a certain bank had also bought 105 cash bars at a price of 29.5 taels. Run Changyu sold, and the June US dollar was traded at 5625, so it increased by 4 taels at 10:50 to 34.5 taels. A moment later, it returned slightly by two taels to 32.6 taels. Retail investors sold, but Hengxing came in. At 11:30, it was 4.3 taels. At noon, it retreated to 2.8 taels. It then closed at 3.3 taels. The revealed price was changed to 800 taels, totaling 70 taels to 63 taels.</p>
<p>▲ In the afternoon, the market was hit by news. The news of Japanese soldiers being bombed and injured caused panic, so the opening price was low, at 27.5 taels. There were many buyers, and it rose immediately to 31 taels. However, the atmosphere was still deteriorating, and the exchange rate was still loose, so sellers followed one after another, including Hengyu, Fuchang, Shunli, Yuanxiang, Hongkang, Yongzhifeng, and Yongdeng. Only Hengxing came in, mostly doing 8,125 for the August US dollar and 125 for the British pound, so the market price plummeted, falling by seven taels to 24 taels at 2:45. The Guangdong gang continued to come in. At 3:00, it was 27.5 taels, then slightly to 4.8 taels. After that, it advanced and retreated alternately, with more than two taels looking back, and the upper transaction was complicated, with only a limited number of numbers. Until more than 4:20, the shorts slightly covered, so it was 7.8 taels. At that time, it was suppressed again to 6.3 taels. At the close at 4:30, it was 26.8 taels, which was 1.9 taels lower than the previous day. According to the difference of eleven taels between the maximum of 35 taels and the minimum of 24 taels in one day, the revealed price was 72.3 taels, the registration supplement water was 33 taels in the morning and 27 taels in the afternoon, and the dual closing price was 5.7 taels.</p>
<p>▲ There was a lot of trading in the industry. According to the surface trading statistics, Yuhe, Hengxing, Chengfengyong, Shunli, Tongtaichang, Zhifengyong, and Yifengyong all entered. Yuanxiang, Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, and Wanxing came in and out in confusion. Yifeng, Hongkangyong, Futaixiang, and Yuantai all came out. In the afternoon, Hengxing and Yifeng entered 1,200 to 1,300 bars. Tongtaichang and Yifengyong also entered. Shunli, Bingxing, Hongkangyong, Yuanxiang, Hengyu, Fuchang, Yuanmaoyong, and Yuhe all came out.</p>
<p>▲ Next week, the first, second, and third days will only trade in the former market. The gold exchange will only be open for half a day in the morning and closed in the afternoon on May 2, 3, and 4 (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) due to the Spring Festival. A notice has already been issued yesterday.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Initially Tight, Then Looser</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC's listed rates uniformly decreased by one notch, entirely due to the silver market's reported decline. However, exchange rate fluctuations were minimal: British gold decreased by 2.5 to 1 shilling, 7 pence, 75, and American dollars decreased by 375 to 30 yuan. Hong Kong dollars remained unchanged, valued at 76 taels, 25. Indian exchange decreased slightly by 1 yuan, 25. French francs fell by 9 yuan, German exchange decreased by 2 yuan, and Japanese yen decreased by 75. Singapore dollars increased by 2 taels. These were mostly bank transaction prices; the outcome was initially tight, then looser. Compared to the previous evening, British gold showed no significant difference, and American dollars only decreased by 0.0625. The price of gold was affected by weakness. Chinese merchants traded briskly: British gold transactions totaled 560,000 pounds, with the gold market slightly selling. American dollars totaled approximately 6-7 million yuan, with more selling than buying. Various banks conducted some offsetting transactions, and Citibank settled forward contracts for May and June in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲The internal market for British exchange fluctuated around 1.875. From the opening selling price of 1 shilling, 8 pence, 7 to a buying price of 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0625 to 125, the market remained stable, offsetting against American and Feng. Wah Bi and Mai Hang entered into forward contracts for June and July at 0625. Mitsui and Sassoon offset contracts for September at 0625. The midday close was flat. In the afternoon, An Xuan and Wah Bi offset July contracts at 1 shilling, 8 pence, 125. Wah Bi bid 1.875 (Guangbang Shengda entered). The closing bid was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 125, with a buying price of 1.875.</p>
<p>▲The internal market for American exchange fluctuated by 3.125. From the morning selling price of 30 yuan, 50 for April and May, 625 for June, and 6875 for July, to a buying price of 30 yuan, 625 to 8125, Shanghai offered 375 for May, and Zhejiang, Zhongfu, and Shanghai offered 30 yuan, 50 for June. Mai Hang entered into a July contract at 625. An Da offered 4375 for May. East Asia offered 625 for July. Zhongfu and Zhejiang offset contracts for June at 5625.

<p>[P Near, far, large strips, long zero six two five</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 29th: Large silver strips, near, far, long, one-sixteenth. The near term is 16 pence, 9375. The far term is 17 pence, 0625. The London exchange rate for New York is 3 yuan, 6 jiao, 5 fen and a half.</p>
<h3>Quiet and Weak Clearing Rates</h3>
<p>▲Market Overview: Yesterday's market was very quiet in the morning, and trading competition was also very weak. Although the volume was still comparable to previous days, the spirit of trade was greatly diminished. Therefore, the closing was determined in one fell swoop without any dissent, resulting in various prices being identical to the opening prices of the previous day. Such behavior is rarely seen in recent times. Even the afternoon market only saw a slight decrease in clearing rates, with minor differences in Jiangjiao, while other prices remained unchanged, indicating the market's dullness.</p>
<p>▲Clearing Prices: "Foreign Clearing" The morning clearing rate was 7 qian, the same as the previous day. The situation remained weak, so the afternoon market price continued to drop by 2 hao and 5 li, re-entering the major barrier at 6 qian, 9 fen, 9 li, 7 hao and a half. However, whether there will be any changes today is still questionable. "Silver Clearing" The morning and afternoon markets were both 1 qian. Banks listed rates at 4 fen, adding water, still doing white clearing. The situation was loose and unregulated.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small foreign coins were 5 qian, 9 fen, 9 li in the morning market and 5 qian, 9 fen, 8 li in the afternoon market, with a difference of 1 li between the two markets. Transactions were 2,000 jiao in the morning market and 1,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 5 qian, 9 fen, 6 li and a half in the morning market, the same price in the afternoon market. Transactions were 125,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were also the same as the previous day at 420 qian and 500 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" Yesterday's bank receipt and disbursement news, due to the proximity of the end of the month, resulted in more settlements. It is estimated that there were more than 3 million in settlements. Other foreign merchants received and disbursed more than 3.4 million in goods, more than 800,000 in mortgage loans, and 300,000 in exchange. Chinese merchants received and disbursed more than 4.5 million in foreign funds, more than 600,000 in customs duties, more than 500,000 in goods, more than 900,000 in exchange, more than 700,000 in money houses, more than 3.5 million in silver public bills, more than 3.4 million in silver clearing funds, and more than 2.5 million in banknote transactions. "Foreign Funds" The morning market saw 735,000 in exchange bills, and the afternoon market saw 360,000. Banknotes only saw 65,000 in the morning market. Bank transactions saw 900,000 in interbank transactions in both markets. Various banks received and disbursed more than 1.3 million in foreign accounts. Money houses received and disbursed more than 4.7 million in foreign public bills. Foreign clearing funds received and disbursed more than 1.7 million. Small money houses traded 4-500,000. The source of customers still had an unknown quantity.</p>
<p>[P Money Houses Gradually Return to Normal&gt;</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai money industry suffered from the Zhabei war, it has planned various protection measures for self-defense. In order to prevent the leakage of cash, there have been regulations on the transfer of bills only among the same industry. Since the implementation, it has been safe and the extremely dangerous difficulties have been safely overcome. Now that the war zone is far away and the Shanghai market is gradually developing, the outside world is quite dissatisfied with this kind of restrictive policy (that is, it refers to the transfer of funds only among the same industry). Therefore, it was decided at an earlier emergency meeting that this restrictive policy will be abolished from May 1st and will be free to circulate as before. However, because the closing period at the end of last year has not yet ended, the issue of lending is not yet being discussed. It must be determined after the final closing at the end of May. If so, the money industry seems to have returned to normal on the surface. From then on, various businesses can be developed arbitrarily, and the cash of various firms can also be circulated. Even the delivery to foreign firms can still be used as collateral for the money houses as usual. However, there is one problem. At the moment, when the tea cocoon season is in full swing, the time when the adoption of advance payments and mortgage payments is the busiest. Recently, it has been very deserted. From the perspective of outsiders, it seems that after the restoration to the original state, there may be hope for adjustment and support. However, according to the industry insiders, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve the goal immediately, or wait another one or two weeks to have a chance to recover. It is hoped that the cocoon season will be able to make loans, but it can only be limited to inter-bank credit loans, not mortgage loans, etc.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bonds Market Opens on May 2nd</h3>
<p>In recent weeks, as the situation has eased and the market sentiment has gradually improved, the Shanghai securities market has repeatedly reported news of the opening of the market. However, it has not been realized because it has not received instructions from the Ministry of Finance. Until yesterday, it was finally decided that the Chinese Securities Exchange has received instructions to allow the market to open on May 2nd. Therefore, if there are no other special reasons affecting the market, there will be no problem with the opening of the bond market.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Flowers, and Cotton Yarn Need Are Quiet</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation is becoming more and more tired, and the actual need is even more deserted. According to the statistics of various gangs who bought it throughout the day, there are only 200 bales. The market is still falling, and the situation is still weak. All gangs have no vitality, and the people are quite uneasy because of this. However, although a certain giant merchant's attitude is arrogant, the need for spot goods is sluggish, and the selling price is still difficult to stand firm. The reason is that the bottom is too thick and the financial situation is very tight, and it is difficult for the business to improve. However, the Money Industry Association has already resolved that it can restore the normal state from May 1st. For the financial aspect, it may be possible to adjust and assist the market, and there is a line of vitality. There may be a development in the future of yarn sales. Ke Gang and Bei Gang entered 65 bales, Tianjin entered 10 bales, the mainland entered 40 bales, Guangdong entered 60 bales, Ningbo entered 7 bales, Anqing entered 5 bales, Fujian entered 12 bales, Shantou entered 5 bales, and the industry entered 10 bales. The selling price fell by 5 qian to 1 tael.</p>
<h3>The Raw Cotton Market Is Extremely Chaotic</h3>
<p>The cotton market situation is still chaotic. The actions of various factories are still few. The reason is that the situation is not peaceful, the silver is weak, and the yarn sales are sluggish. The intention to purchase raw materials is becoming more and more relaxed, and the price of gold is rising, and the exchange rate is shrinking. Although the price of foreign cotton has fallen, if the silver price is calculated, it is still not cheap. Although the bottom of the local cotton is dry, the factories have no intention to increase the amount because the yarn market is not prosperous. Only Chongxin Factory entered 2,400 dan of fire machine flowers, and the price was 30 taels. Spot goods were delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Fell by Twelve Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was sluggish due to the downturn in Wall Street, the closing of long positions, and the reduction of buyers. The futures market fell by 10 to 12 pounds. The spot market fell by 10 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 1-2 points. The spot market fell by 5 points. The Egyptian cotton spot market did not move. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 26th): American cotton, compared with the previous day, conforms to the Shanghai regulations, British cotton, compared with the previous day, conforms to the Shanghai regulations.</p>

<h3>Silkworm Rearing In Xucun Reveals "Yellow Discharge"</h3>
<p>▲Early cocoons start to produce leaves after the third sleep</p>
<p>▲Silkworm farmers are generally pessimistic</p>
<p>Xucun in Chang'an is a well-known silkworm rearing area. This year, farmers, in light of last year's failed silkworm rearing, have been diligently breeding improved strains. The amount of feeding is still not small. During the first two sleeps, the silkworm ants developed quite well. The early groups have already started to produce leaves after the third sleep for three or four mornings. However, recently there have been continuous overcast and rainy days, with uneven temperatures. The silkworm ants are eating more leaves every day, and farmers have been careless in feeding leaves. Silkworms eating rain-soaked leaves have been found to have "yellow discharge" and other diseases, causing significant leaf shedding. Silkworm farmers are generally pessimistic.</p>
<h3>White Fabrics Improve Slightly in Sales to Inland Areas</h3>
<p>▲Unfortunately, the selling price is insufficient to cover the factory's mortgage principal and interest</p>
<p>The Shanghai white fabric industry has been offering very low prices through foreign firms, and factories have found it difficult to sell due to heavy capital commitments, resulting in a standstill. However, inland silk weaving factories have a need for fabrics due to a turnaround in silk sales. Unfortunately, the offered prices for 10-15 fine fabrics are only 650-660 taels, and the prices for 20-22 coarse fabrics are only 570-580 taels. Since the factories' silk is mortgaged and they need 700-800 taels or more per bale to redeem the principal and interest, transactions are scarce. Yesterday, only Hangzhou Silk Factory brought in 10 bales of spot goods, and Lianna brought in 20 bales of white dry fabrics. Prices continued to weaken.</p>
<h3>San Francisco Reports Obstruction of Raw Silk Imports</h3>
<p>▲Citizens refuse the import of Japanese mail... Japanese silk is becoming increasingly scarce. Since various circles in the United States launched a boycott of Japanese goods, the movement has been progressing rapidly. A boycott association has been established and citizens have refused the import of Japanese mail. As a result, Japanese silk exports to the United States are becoming increasingly scarce. In the past two weeks, only 400 bales or so of Japanese silk have been imported through the port of San Francisco, and they were shipped through other countries' postal ships.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Has Already Opened Gardens</h3>
<p>The new Qimen black tea has been slow to develop green buds due to the cold weather after Qingming. Since the day before yesterday, the weather suddenly turned warm, and the buds have grown a little longer. In addition, the days are sunny and the mornings have dew, making the quality very fragrant and thick. The mountain households are taking advantage of this sunny and warm weather to open the gardens of tea trees early. Tea companies, because new tea is on the market, will stop collecting green leaves and have sent people to the villages to search for them. It is expected that the entire group will start weighing around tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Because the mountain households believe that the tea companies have not reduced production this year, they insist on selling at the old prices. Therefore, it seems difficult to reduce the mountain price when weighing begins compared to the past.</p>
<p>[P Dexing Tea Houses Difficult to Open</p>
<p>Dexing is an important tea-producing area in northern Jiangxi, with an annual output of no less than 2. Farmers have been uneasy about farming for three years, and they have become less interested in cultivating tea trees, resulting in the daily decline of tea houses in Dexing in the past two years. This year, Haikou, the center of tea houses, has been occupied by Red bandits, and all commercial activities have been suspended. The original tea houses have not been able to open in time, and other places have been afraid to do so due to the unrest of the bandits. Mountain households, who have always relied on tea for their livelihood, have been completely cut off from their livelihood.</p>
<h3>Anhui Tea Merchants Oppose Increasing Taxes</h3>
<p>Anhui foreign tea merchants' black tea is a major export commodity to overseas countries. The national government, in addition to halving the tea tax in the inland, also allows full exemption of various taxes at the time of export. Two years ago, the li bureau was abolished, and the tea li in each county was unified and collected by the business tax authority, which stipulated 5% of the value. This year, the Anhui Finance Department specifically designated bamboo, wood, tea cocoons, sugar, and other items as special taxes, and changed the box tea to 20% of the value. Recently, it also sent personnel to various tea-producing areas to set up bureaus and collect taxes. The tea industry in Qimen County, Tunxi, and Wuyuan in Huizhou feels that the increased tax on box tea is difficult to bear and has submitted requests to the Ministry of Finance for a reduction to alleviate the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Fall Near Corner</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday, each Shanghai southern gang's sources were from more than ten households, and there was still a lot of storage in the warehouses. It was also heard that the intention to enter the market in the northern city was slightly repaired, which made the intention to refine it even more detailed. Therefore, the thick japonica rice market was fresh and tired. The next was the thin rice that had accumulated slightly, with Ning Wei not moving. The actual consumption on this street was affected by the squeezing of the boat rice, and it was said to be stagnant, resulting in a price that was gradually repaired near the corner. The rush-colored acuminate was also reduced by the small twisting rice. The short and discolored Yin Yuan cargo was in short supply and slightly supported.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, in the northern city, it rained and the rice market was completely inactive. Fresh goods from Su and Xi arrived, and the sales area was light, so the situation was fixed. There was very little trading of rice from Liyang and Kunshan, and the price was tired outside the corner. The top fixed-grade rice from foreign ports and the inferior thin rice from the downstream areas were neither good nor bad. The opening of each factory on the river was about 3,000 shi.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Revive</h3>
<p>▲Each scattered gang on the main street in Hankou has sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice became active again. Hankou's gang moved again and removed about 3,000 bags of small twisting rice. Each scattered gang on the main street, the mainland, Ningbo, and other routes had sales. The middle and inferior grades recovered and rose near the corner. Other grades rose by several points. It is estimated that 1,000 bags of the No. 1 Saigon import goods were opened at a price of 11 yuan, 3 jiao, and a half to 3 jiao. A total of 10,000 bags of small twisting rice were opened at a price of 10 yuan, 2 jiao. The middle and inferior grades were 10 yuan, 1 jiao to 9 yuan, 8 jiao, and 8 fen. There were few futures transactions, and only 300 tons of small twisting rice were traded back and forth for April at 4 taels, 7 qian, and a half and for May at 4 taels, 9 qian and a half. The market was similar to the previous market. Yuan rice from a Jiangxi machine was opened again at a price of 13 yuan, 8 jiao, and a half to 1 jiao and 2 fen for 400 bags of stored goods in Zhongguan.</p>
<h3>Spot Flour Sells Out, Price Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market showed a tired state again. Because the gold market transactions were very cold, there were only a few responses from the northern and southern gangs. Therefore, the spot goods in this month seemed to be nearly a point less than the previous month. Only 2 taels, 0 jiao, 6 fen, and 7 li and a half were opened, and then it was opened to 7 fen. In May, it was also not prosperous because there were very few buyers. Only 2 taels, 0 jiao, 7 fen to 7 fen and 2 li and a half were opened. However, foreign wheat quotations fell sharply yesterday. For example, Canada fell by 7 jiao, and Chicago fell by about 9 jiao. If this continues to fall, it may be necessary to see another impulse in the future.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand, White, Quiet, Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's trading was still quiet. The transaction price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was 12 taels and 8 qian, and the price of Hong Kong goods was 12 taels and 7 qian. The market was still stable. The recipient of No. 20 medium sand white was also small at 12 taels and 5 qian and a half. The price of Taikoo sugar B mark was 16 taels and 2 qian, and the post-market price was 16 taels and 1 qian and a half. The transaction of YD mark was still prosperous at 15 taels and 2 qian and a half. The trend was firm. A few dozen packages of national branch red were opened at a price of 10 taels and 4 qian and a half. The market was firm and elegant.</p>
<p>[P A Glimpse of the Slackness of the Piece Goods Market&gt;</p>
<p>Whether it is native cotton cloth or foreign goods, piece goods trading is very sluggish. The reason is that the financial situation has not yet recovered at the end of the month, so it is difficult for local customers to purchase as much as possible. In addition, the popular East goods in the northern ports and the revival of the port are all seriously hit. Yesterday, the market was still not prosperous, and the transactions in the market were like morning stars. The downward trend of various goods has not stopped. Although fine cloth and small twill have fallen, it is difficult to stimulate actual sales. The lack of 13-pound double-warp coarse cloth has once been seen, and now there are spot goods that are opened at 6 taels and 2 qian and a half. 14-pound feeding horses fell by 5 fen and sold for 7 taels and 5 fen. 11-pound cloth, Ren Zhong, Cao Niu, all had a consistent price of 4 taels and 6 qian. Native fine serge and straight tribute satin were all stagnant. The 7-silk raw silk of Western goods, which had been slightly active at this time in previous years, is now rarely inquired about. Sassoon's bald white is opened at 5 taels, and the variegated color is 5 taels and 5 qian. The fair bald white is 5 taels and 5 qian, and the variegated color is 6 taels. The momentum of plain foreign yarn has greatly decreased due to the still high opening price. Most white stripe linen yarn is sold at 2 qian and 8 fen. The impact linen yarn has fallen into the 2 qian mark. Most of the newly arrived goods are not sold because the cost is high, and they all have to lose money when sold. Therefore, there are quite a few who go to the Customs warehouse.</p>
<h3>Hankou Gang Purchases Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>The Hankou gang has purchased woolen fabrics in large quantities over the years, and the area along Changjiang Road has been the most prosperous. Since the flood last year, the commercial vitality has been greatly lost, and there have been no inquiries about woolen fabrics and woolen goods. Recently, guests from the gang have gradually become active, and some have personally come to Shanghai to purchase them. However, there are only sporadic transactions, and they are all sent by mail or entrusted to ship friends to take them away. Yesterday, such as French flannel, valetaine, serge, Wattne, raincoat cloth, summer white goods, etc., were all negotiated and sent to be marked. It was found that the gang had stopped handling woolen fabrics and woolen goods for more than a few days, and now the transaction is simply the purchase of the batch.</p>
<h3>More Than One Hundred Tons of Hardware and Blue Lead Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>The trading of blue lead has been cold recently after the tea gangs' boom. Although various industries are trying their best to sell aggressively, there is not much actual sales, resulting in a very calm market. The standard opening price is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, estimated at 13 taels and 7 qian and a half per dan. It is heard that the price can be cheaper if a large number of orders are placed. Therefore, people's hearts have been exceptionally buoyant recently. However, according to the import, it was found that more than one hundred tons arrived again yesterday, so the market is deserted, and there is no fear of a shortage of spot goods.</p>
<h3>A Piece of Cold News in Hardware</h3>
<p>"Patterned Lead Wire" Since the outbreak of the war, the way out has been sharp, and the goods at the bottom have been searched almost completely. As a result, the standard has soared. Recently, the situation has turned peaceful, and there are no more additions to this kind of anti-defense thing. Due to this trend, "Blue Lead" Tea gang business has shown a decline, and export transactions have also been cold. Therefore, there is more supply than demand, resulting in the standard having a strong external and weak internal atmosphere. It is currently sold for 13 taels and 7 qian, which is a drop of 1 qian compared to before. It is heard that there are only sporadic transactions.</p>
<p>"Small Wuxi Tin" After the Shaoxing gang's entanglement due to the delivery of cash goods, the way out has been greatly reduced. The market has only been decorated with dozens of pieces a day recently, so it is difficult for the market to see a good return. It was opened at 89 taels yesterday. It is heard that there were only 35 dan in actual delivery.</p>
<p>"French Western Nails" At present, the transaction is also exceptionally deserted. Although the industry is trying its best to sell aggressively, there is not much actual delivery. Therefore, the market price is not easy to raise. It is currently sold at 8 taels. It is found that various gangs have no inquiries except for inquiries.</p>

<h3>Sixty Years of Fragments from This Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan, Huang Jiping</p>
<p>Sixty years in a human life is precisely a full cycle of the zodiac. One gradually feels that their energy is waning, their back is stooped, their skin is wrinkled and loose, and their hair is streaked with gray. In the course of a lifetime, one has indeed reached the point of "the sunset is infinitely beautiful, but it is only approaching dusk." Therefore, when saying polite things to others, one always refers to oneself as "old and decrepit." There is also a common saying, "An old person is like a yellowed pearl," meaning they are worthless. In fact, elderly people are not necessarily "old and decrepit," nor are they necessarily "worthless." Confucius traveled around the states when he was past sixty, and Jiang Taigong met King Wen at eighty, which is even more well-known. Even the great figures of the West mostly achieved great fame and great accomplishments in their later years. The great American inventor Thomas Edison was still inventing new things and benefiting mankind even after he was eighty. The three great heroes of the European War, Foch, Haig, and Joffre, all served their countries on the battlefield at the advanced age of over sixty. The German President Paul von Hindenburg, although already eighty-five years old, is still persevering and striving for the country. These people are truly "old but vigorous" and are by no means comparable to ordinary young people. This is true of people, and it is also true of newspapers. Our Shen Bao has been around for a full sixty-year cycle since its inception, and can be considered a veteran in the newspaper industry. But although it is old, its energy has not waned and it is as vigorous as ever. Seeing its lively and energetic appearance, it is truly rejuvenating itself. The previous sixty years have been completely erased, and from this year on, it is a young brother who is just one year old, watching it grow year by year and make a career with enthusiasm. We have been ordered by the owner to briefly talk about the affairs of this newspaper over the past sixty years as a memento. However, Shoujuan has only served the Shen Bao for more than ten years, and Jiping only for two or three years. How can we shoulder this great task? Fortunately, we still have some reference materials, and we also have several senior gentlemen who can serve as our advisors, so we have put together this record of the fragments of the Shen Bao over the past sixty years.</p>
<p>(1) This newspaper was founded forty years before the founding of the Republic of China, that is, in the eleventh year of the reign of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty, the year of Ren Shen. The founder was an American named Major. He was a British citizen and at that time, he was engaged in two businesses in China: one was the Jiangsu Soda Factory, and the other was the Jicheng Bookstore Company. The Shen Bao was also established. Major was a pioneer in running newspapers in China by foreigners. The first editor-in-chief was Jiang Jun Zhixiang, and the manager was Zhao Jun Yiru. A newspaper was published every two days, printed on domestic Mao Tai paper. The format was very small and the content was mostly poetry and prose, with occasional Chinese and foreign news items, but these were only used as embellishments and were not highly valued by readers. The solicitation regulations on the birth announcement of this newspaper stated, "If there are famous sayings or discussions related to national economy, people's livelihood, geography, or water sources, those that concern the needs of the imperial dynasty's economy and inform the suffering of the common people's farming, if they are published in this newspaper, no payment will be accepted." It can be seen that in the beginning, in addition to the above-mentioned scope, contributors had to pay considerable publication fees, which is exactly the opposite of the current situation. At this time, most of the outstanding members of society were immersed in the imperial examinations, and few were willing to engage in the newspaper business. Only uninhibited literati and unbridled scholars would use newspapers to express their repressed feelings or relieve their boredom. Correspondents from various ports would collect and report on trivial matters in the neighborhoods, which were unrelated to national affairs or the people's livelihood. Even if they obtained such information, they would not dare to put it into writing, fearing to offend the authorities. In fact, there was no freedom of speech, let alone in the autocratic era, but even in the Republic of China, when was there freedom? This newspaper was first published on March 23rd and published five issues. From March 30th, it was changed to a daily publication. The following year, Taiwanese aborigines killed Gao Shan people, and Japan sent troops to demand redress. Major personally interviewed and revealed the truth completely. Therefore, everyone understood the function of newspapers and rushed to buy and read them. The daily sales reached several thousand copies and the reputation soared. The Mao Tai paper was changed to Sai Lian paper to facilitate printing. As a result, imperial edicts and important news were telegraphed and transmitted quickly. Later, Jiang Jun was promoted and succeeded by Qian Jun Xinbo, who was determined to reform and discarded all kinds of embellishments and fictional novels, focusing on news. Major agreed with their plan and divided the work after it was finalized. When the Vietnamese rebellion broke out and the Sino-French War began, other newspapers concealed defeats and promoted victories to please readers. Major hired a Russian to follow the French camp to investigate. The reports were detailed and accurate. However, some people mistakenly thought that he was biased towards the French, and the Shen Bao was almost made the target of public criticism. At that time, the newspaper competing with the Shen Bao was the Hu Bao. It used the method of flattering readers to promote the victory of the Chinese army. As a result, the weaknesses of the Chinese army were exposed, and the whole country was shocked. This was exactly the same as the soldiers who advocated non-resistance in the current Sino-Japanese War. As a result, the people of the country all knew the failure of the war, and the Shen Bao's grievances were known to the world. Therefore, sales soared and the number of households seeking to place advertisements was overwhelming, so an additional sheet of Sai Lian paper was printed and then changed to foreign machine paper. After several years, Major stated that the Shen Bao had been successfully managed and felt that his energy was declining. In addition, the other new businesses he had created were also gradually completed. It was time to retire gracefully, so he changed the Shen Bao to a company and appointed his fellow countryman Fenlin Apana to succeed him. At that time, the Shen Bao was the only newspaper operating in the market, so the results were naturally remarkable. Later, editor-in-chief Huang Jun Shiquan and manager Xi Jun Zimei took charge of the entire newspaper. At this time, China was undergoing political reform, and the Zhongwai Daily and other newspapers emerged, and newspapers also had the opportunity to reform. Thirty years after Guangxu, the Shen Bao broke away from the relationship with foreign merchants and underwent major reforms. Xi Jun Zipei was the manager, and Huang Jun resigned due to old age and illness. Jin Jun Jianhua was appointed as the editor-in-chief, and Lei Jun and other old editors continued to serve and carefully planned and reorganized the newspaper. The Shen Bao gradually entered an era of prosperity. This is the situation before the current general manager took over.</p>
<p>(2) Speaking of the content of this newspaper at that time, it is also a very interesting historical material in the newspaper industry. (1) The records are roughly divided into three categories: one is imperial edicts, official documents, and yamen transcripts, etc., so that people in the officialdom can know the situation of promotions and demotions, which is called "rare news from the officialdom"; the second is anecdotes from various ports, such as the topics of the examination halls and academies, as well as cases of robbery, disaster, and unusual events, as well as tales of ghosts and spirits, which ordinary people use as topics of conversation after drinking and eating, which is called "unofficial biography"; the third is poetry, with people writing poems to each other, or describing romance and vying for elegance, and famous scholars and talented men are honored to have their names published in the newspaper, which is like a disguised poetry society. We can infer that the psychology of getting promoted and making a fortune, and the cycle of national disasters, have remained the same for sixty years. The political system has been reformed, but politics has never been on the right track, which is disappointing. (2) The order of compilation is as follows: essays are in the first place, followed by imperial edicts or official documents, important news from various provinces and ports is titled separately, and ordinary news is given a general title according to its location, such as "Shanglin Spring Scenery" and "Forbidden Garden Autumn Sounds" for Beijing, "Baimen Willow Colors" for Nanjing, "Iron Chain Waves" for Zhenjiang, "Lülang Yan Shadow" for Suzhou, "Fengliu Wenyun" for Songjiang, "West Lake Songs" for Hangzhou, "Yuanyang Lake Fishermen's Songs" for Jiaxing, "Crane Tower Flute Rhymes" for Wuchang, "Penpu Tide" for Jiujiang, "Wan Gong Mountain Colors" for Anqing, and "Yangcheng Sunset" for Guangzhou, etc., changing and applying them endlessly. The end is the local news, and the example is the same as the foreign news, but the general title is called the case of a certain sector's public hall or the records of a certain sector's police station. Statistics: essays and news combined into three editions, and advertisements into one edition. (3) Editing time: from noon to the time of lighting the lamps, but if there is one thing that is considered particularly important, no matter when it happens, it must be immediately added to the edition, that is, a fire in the local area. In the deep night, "those who hear the alarm bell and sleep soundly must also put on their clothes and get up, and dare not forget it." In addition, the results of horse races in spring and autumn, the topics of various examinations, and the full list of provincial and metropolitan examinations are also published as soon as they arrive. Therefore, whenever Zhejiang and Jiangsu announce the results, the editors and translators of telegrams must exhaust their efforts all night, and the sales volume the next morning will increase by one-third compared to usual, which shows that people at that time regarded success in the imperial examinations as the greatest honor. (4) When this newspaper was first founded, the price per copy in the local area was eight wen, and the price per copy outside the local area was ten wen, with a wholesale price of six wen. The daily sales were six hundred copies. By the end of the thirteenth year of Tongzhi, it had increased by more than six hundred copies. In May of the second year of Guangxu, the daily sales were more than two thousand copies. In the third year, it suddenly increased to more than five thousand copies. In the sixth year, it was distributed in important ports. In the thirty-first year, branch offices were established in various places. In the thirty-third year, it was sold in Japan and major European and American cities. Overseas Chinese all knew about "Shen Bao." This newspaper was founded the earliest, and the Chinese people have the deepest impression of this newspaper. Even today, no matter in cities or villages, when they see paper, they always say "Shen Bao paper." It is as if the three words "Shen Bao paper" are synonymous with any newspaper. This is clear proof of the old qualifications of the Shen Bao. (5) Advertisements and supplementary publications: When this newspaper was first founded, commerce was immature and merchants did not understand the effectiveness of advertising. At that time, advertisements only included announcements of ship imports and exports, auctions, and missing persons, etc. The publication fee was 250 wen for every fifty characters. Foreigners' advertisements were charged one yuan per day. From the twelfth year, the advertisement fee for companies and insurance was five li per word on the first day, and halved from the second day, with the same rule for both Chinese and Westerners. This kind of situation is really interesting. Now commerce relies entirely on advertising. The so-called "advertising is capital." Advertising is blown too far, and it is the opposite of not knowing how to use advertising in the past. This newspaper initially published one sheet. In the eighth year of Guangxu, an additional sheet of the Beijing News was added to specifically record news from the capital. In the second year of Xuantong, due to the crowding of news, a weekly magazine named "New Shen Bao" was published every Sunday. In the third year of Xuantong, another column named "Free Talk" was added. In the early years of the Republic of China, another column called "Old Shen Bao" was added to publish a review of more than forty years, but it was soon abolished. In September of the eighth year, a weekly supplement was published, which contained a record of major domestic and foreign events for one week. Since then, various supplements and appendices have been published. Special editions are added on New Year's Day or National Day. This is something that has happened in the last ten years, and readers can recall it, so I don't need to explain it in detail. (3) The original building of the Shen Bao was located across from the Hankou Road Red Church, which is now the location of the Public Works Bureau. The transportation there was very convenient, but the one-story building was a bit too small. It is said that at first, only Major's office was considered tall and clean. The living and working places of other colleagues were very different. Not only was the area of the house small, but also the light was very dark. Four people were mixed in a room. All the furnishings were very similar to the small room where poor people lived. Accommodation, diet, office work, meetings, and even urination and defecation were all in this small room, so naturally they felt cramped. In winter, the cold wind was biting, and in summer, it was as hot as a furnace. The most unbearable thing was the bedbugs. They reproduced so quickly that they were everywhere and impossible to prevent. Sometimes they were very tired from working day and night, and when they lay down on the bed, they were disturbed all night and could not sleep peacefully. The newspaper did not provide meals. Three meals a day were either eaten in restaurants or servants were called to buy some snacks. Whether it was coarse steamed buns or bland rice, they only sought to fill their stomachs. The equipment in the newspaper was simple and the life was lonely. I think the senior reporters at that time must have felt unbearable when they recalled the hardships they had endured. During the Guangxu period, the newspaper moved to the old site of Wangping Street, and then moved to the house of the current Shishi Xinbao. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, it moved from Wangping Street to Tianjin Road Taijili. During this period, a new building was being planned. It was not until October 1st of the seventh year that it was completely moved into the new building. On the Double Tenth Festival, a ceremony was held to celebrate the completion of the new building. Guests from all parties came to observe the ceremony and visit the new or rotary printing press and the old Shen Bao of more than forty years. This ceremony also occupied a glorious page in the history of this newspaper. This Western-style five-story building can be described as "great and sublime" compared to other newspapers in Shanghai. Even among the newspapers in the country, it is second to none. But what is said at one time is said at one time. The material supplies needed by mankind are completely transferred with the times. What is considered satisfactory today may not be in the future. The so-called "future generations view the present as the present views the past." I hope that when this newspaper celebrates its centenary, the newspaper business will have made great progress and there will be extraordinary construction in terms of material things, just like the Chicago Tribune newspaper in the United States, which sells two or three million copies a day and has a 24-story building. That is considered to be the pinnacle!</p>
<p>(4) The Free Talk column of this newspaper was founded in the third year of Xuantong, that is, July 1st of the Xin Hai year, August 24th, 1911, Thursday. Before this day, although some short essays and novels were also published, with categories such as "Pure Talk," "Miscellaneous Records," and "Records of Events," there was no special column, and the novel "Unnamed Sinner" was also published on another page. The author signed himself as "Unnamed," which seems to be the work of Mr. Chen Leng. After the Free Talk column was born on July 1st of the Xin Hai year, the first editor was Mr. Wang Dun'gen from Qingpu. The format was larger than the current one. The masthead was the five characters "Shen Bao Free Talk" in hollowed-out letters, divided into eight categories: (1) Amusing Articles, (2) Sudden Whims, (3) Laughing It Off, (4) Strange Tales from Overseas, (5) Generous and Tragic Songs, (6) Delicate Sentiments, (7) Miscellaneous Records from the Zunwen Pavilion, and (8) Novels. The first amusing article was Dun'gen's own work, "The Pregnancy Aid Society." The first novel was Dun'gen and Yi Reng's translation, "The Love of Animals." This is very memorable in the history of Free Talk. Dun'gen was amiable and liked to be humorous, so he listed amusing articles as the first category. Later, he suddenly had the idea of ​​actively participating in the business world, so he resigned. As far as I know, the editors who took over the Free Talk column were Mr. Tian Xuwo, Yao _, Wu Juemi, and Bu Leng. Mr. Tian Xuwo was a famous figure known to women and children. He created the Invincible brand of toothpaste, which was popular throughout the country and drove out the Japanese Diamond toothpaste. This was a very gratifying thing. During his time as the editor of Free Talk, in addition to poetry, novels, and all kinds of short essays, he paid more attention to two categories: "Family Knowledge" and "Intellectual Records," which were very popular among readers at the time, and the grand plan to create the Invincible brand of toothpaste was launched here. This is truly a very glorious page in the history of Free Talk!</p>
<p>Mr. Yao _, a native of Yunjian, was a famous master of poetry and prose. He was romantic and unconventional, and had the style of a celebrity. At that time, the Free Talk column was naturally elegant and full of poetic spirit. Later, I don't know why, he washed his hands and quit. In recent years, he has been mixing in the political world and working as an official, revolving around "etc." and "according to this," and he has not even seen poetry and prose. In addition, there was also Mr. Wu Juemi from Chuansha who had also served the Free Talk column. He liked textual research and was familiar with Shanghai stories, but the period of service was relatively short and he had other high positions. It is a pity that he died of lung disease last year. The editor's seat of Free Talk was vacant for some time and was concurrently managed by Editor-in-Chief Chen Leng. The characteristic at that time was his self-written "Free Talk of Free Talk," which was very cold and concise, and Mr. Wang Yizhi's "Travel to America Observations," which was also a popular work. At that time, Shoujuan had also served as a special contributor, and often had manuscripts in between, acting as a small soldier waving the flag and shouting. Later, he entered the newspaper to work as an editor. I remember that it was from the eighth year of the Republic of China to the present, which is a full thirteen years. In these thirteen years, I have been confused and do not know what is going on. I want to perform an ugly show of merit, but I simply have no way to do it. What can be said is that the format of Free Talk has increased or decreased from time to time, and the compilation has also changed from time to time. At one point, dozens of memory texts by Mr. Zhu _ Chu were published, with beautiful writing and affection, which was most admired. And Mr. Bi Yihong's novel "Human Hell" also received extraordinary praise. Unfortunately, these two gentlemen have passed away one after another, and the tomb grass has been resting for a long time. Every time I think of it, my stomach hurts. Also, at one point, two special issues of family and novels were published every half month, called "Family Semi-Monthly Publication" and "Novel Semi-Monthly Publication." Every festival also published special editions such as New Year's Edition, Spring Festival Edition, Qingming Edition, Dragon Boat Festival Edition, Mid-Autumn Festival Edition, Double Ninth Festival Edition, and Christmas Edition. I remember there was one (a miniature of the most recent issue of Free Talk)</p>
<p>Once, in the Mid-Autumn Festival special issue, the text was arranged in a circular shape, like the bright moon of the day, which aroused the interest of readers. As for other indefinite special editions, texts of the same nature are summarized together, such as the Love Issue, the Summer Heat Issue, etc., and I can't remember many other kinds of love, and all the recent readers have probably witnessed it, so please forgive us for not turning over old records and calculating old accounts anymore.</p>
<h3>Words on the Sixtieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Two guests, A and B, talked about the lifespan of Chinese newspapers. Guest A said, "None lives longer than the Circulation Daily in Hong Kong. Since Tiannan Dunsou took over as editor-in-chief, it has been passed down to this day and is already sixty-eight years old. Among the old newspapers, none can surpass it."</p>
<p>Guest B said, "No, no. Although the Hong Kong newspaper is old, it is not a newspaper within the territory of our country. It seems that it should be discussed separately. The newspaper with the longest lifespan and the most long-standing history in our country is the Shen Bao, which is sixty years old this year."</p>
<p>Mr. Jia and Mr. Yi heard this and laughed, saying, "Although the Shen Bao is old, it is not old at all. We have heard that the oldest newspaper is the Hindu, which is over eighty years old."</p>
<p>Guests A and B were both surprised by his words. They thought that although there were many newspapers in our country, the Hindu, which was over eighty years old, seemed to be unheard of. Perhaps Mr. Jia is entangled again?</p>
<p>Mr. Jia and Mr. Yi firmly said that it was true. And said, "Recently, Shanghai newspapers have mostly carried the history of this eighty-year-old Hindu. You should also have heard of it."</p>
<p>Guest B suddenly said, "Sir, you are mistaken. This is Hindenburg, not the Hindu. This is the German President, not the newspaper." Guest A laughed and said, "Comparing Hindenburg to the Shen Bao is also quite appropriate. Hindenburg is old and vigorous, and the Shen Bao is also old and vigorous. Hindenburg is supported by tens of millions of people and is the President of Germany. The Shen Bao is also welcomed by tens of millions of people and is the king of the newspaper industry. Mr. Jia's words, although entangled, are not entangled." Therefore, he made a eulogy, saying:</p>
<p>The Shen Bao is sixty years old. Hindenburg is over eighty. The two elders are the great elders of the world. Old and vigorous, although old, they are still young. It is not too late or too early to learn boxing at sixty. Sixty years of feng shui rotation. The weak are strong, and the strong fall. Fortune and misfortune are unpredictable. Give the island of Fusang a white eye.</p>
<h3>Recommencement</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Newspapers are a medium for imparting civilization and communicating knowledge. The strength, prosperity, and decline of a country are always judged by the quantity, quality, and quality of its newspapers. The birth of this newspaper was sixty years ago. At that time, the sea ban had just been lifted, and we were still stuck in the old ways. We regarded the culture and scholarship of Europe and the United States as looking at flowers in the fog, and could not understand the truth. When this newspaper rose up in time, it was the pioneer of introducing civilization and the forerunner of enlightening the people's wisdom. For sixty years, it can be said that it has fulfilled its responsibility of transporting and encouraging. Looking back on the past sixty years, the enlightenment of the people's wisdom and the awakening of the national soul have indeed made some progress, but in general, the results are still not satisfactory. Because we are in this transitional period, we have not clearly understood the civilization of Europe and the United States. Our selection is not careful, and our plagiarism and imitation follow step by step. Therefore, we cut our feet to fit our shoes and discard the essence and use the dross. The effect is not obvious, and there are many drawbacks. Personal life is accustomed to the enjoyment of material things, and the pursuit is insatiable. Education, politics, and all social undertakings are commercialized and advertised, and decorated without being practical. Gradually, they become extravagant, luxurious, and false. Until today, disasters have occurred one after another, and dangers are all around. The fate of the country is precarious. However, is this the fault of the newspapers? It is that we have abandoned the essence and taken the dross, and are blind to choice.</p>
<p>The old calendar of our country has always used the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches to record the years. Sixty years is a Jiazi, a full cycle, and a recommencement. Now this newspaper has come out of the year of recommencement. Our country is encountering major foreign troubles, and the whole country is awakened. It is also at the time of transition between continuation and extinction. I deeply hope that this newspaper will carry on the spirit of the past, build on the past and open up the future, and create a new life that is greater and more efficient. In the country, it should provide guidance that is suitable for the national conditions and environment, strive for hard work and practicality, reward and promote construction, seek the development of reason, and suppress the bad habits of selfishness, complacency, hypocrisy, and arrogance. For the introduction of foreign countries, we should promote the spirit of science, the rule of law, group struggle, etc., so that the descendants of Yan and Huang will have a day to raise their heads again on the world stage, and the future glory of this newspaper will also be immortalized by the creation of a new history.</p>
<h3>Celebration of Elderly Support in the Village</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>A fool read the Old Book of Tang: "In later years, if there are auspicious omens, all officials will be ordered not to report them." He was surprised and said, "The Shen Bao already existed in the Tang Dynasty. No wonder people today call the Shen Bao the Old Shen Bao." This is indeed a joke. However, the Shen Bao is extremely old and has a history of sixty years. We juniors should respect the sixty-year-old Shen Bao as a father or elder. According to ancient etiquette, at sixty one is supported in the village, at seventy one is supported in the state, and at eighty one is supported in the court. Virtue and prestige increase with age, and status increases with age. The sixtieth anniversary of the Shen Bao is just a celebration of elderly support in the village. In the future, sales and age will increase together, and trust and age will advance together, then what will the seventieth and eightieth anniversaries be like? I sincerely wish it well. Moreover, I have been writing for the Shen Bao Free Talk for several years. Following in its footsteps, I have gained a lot of guidance. On the occasion of its celebration of elderly support in the village, I have written a few words to praise it, and I will offer it as a toast.</p>
<h3>Talking about the Master of the Six Zhai Studio</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The master of Free Talk sent a letter to inform me of the sixtieth anniversary and asked me to write an article to commemorate the event. On the spot, I came up with six points to talk about.</p>
<p>▲Six Ding: The Six Ding refer to the Ding years in the sixty-year cycle. The twenty-first year of the Republic of China has already passed two cycles. In the Ding Si year in the Jia Yin cycle, there was a restoration change, which was an ominous year. In the Ding Mao year in the Jia Zi cycle, there was a bloody battle, which was an ominous year. In the future, the Ding Chou, Ding Hai, Ding You, and Ding Wei years, I only hope to have a peaceful year. Then, in the Six Ding, two Dings have passed, and four Dings are in the future. Our people still have great hope.</p>
<p>▲Six Roots: Buddhists regard the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind as the six roots. There is a saying that the six roots are pure. Today, the six roots of people are very painful. What the eyes see is the broken mountains and rivers. What the ears hear is the sound of gunfire. What the nose smells is the smell of wounded soldiers. What the tongue utters is不敢直言。</p>
<p>莫能自由。意所指。無辭可逹　。　　▲六味苦酸甘辛鹹淡。謂之六味。今之執政者。對外交。一副苦臉。對妻妾。一番甘言對。政費一。種酸態對。税收一心鹹欵。對人民。一向冷淡。此六味之新釋也。　　▲六家古以學術之流别。日儒家日。墨家。日名家。日法家。日道德家。日陰陽家。今亦有六家。日綁票家。日跪狗家。日跳舞家。日共產家。日賣國家。日内亂家。　　▲六國古之六國。日楚。日齊。日燕。日韓。日魏。日。趙今世界不祇六國。而中國似有六國。東三省旣爲暴日强佔。僞號日滿洲國。此有形之國也。無形之國。如冀察。如晋綏。如魯。如兩粤。如四川。合而數之日六。</p>
<p>▲六工土工金工石工木工獸工草工是今。之土工。爲闊人掘戰壕。金工爲闊人製槍砲。石工爲闊人造墳地。木工爲闊人建華厦。獸工爲闊人喂豬馬。草工爲闊人守花園。</p>
<h3>Feelings on the Sixtieth Anniversary of the Shen Bao</h3>
<p>Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Looking back fifty-nine years ago, the first paper had the most light. Broken robes and palms are familiar with anecdotes. Snow flies in June by the historians.</p>
<p>The twelfth year of Tongzhi was the second year of the Shen Bao's birth. My family had already read it. At that time, it was printed on glossy paper. Just when the case of Ge Pinlian in Yuhang shocked the court and the public, the memorials and documents were all recorded in detail. Several years later, my fellow villager, Mr. Jin Shouting, used it to cut and tailor it into a novel, "June Snow," with tens of thousands of words, under the pen name Tian *. At that time, it was published by the Zhongshu Bureau. At that time, I first knew it and helped him organize and arrange these old newspapers.</p>
<p>Talking about the earth and revealing freedom. Horizontal and vertical, up and down, cleverly collected. How can a glimpse of time pass away? I also feel old and white-headed.</p>
<p>When Tian Xuwo edited Free Talk, I submitted the novel "A Glimpse" to it. When it was published, it was attached with a letter from Mr. Xu Yongqing. This was the beginning of my literary connection with the Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Qin Nan is old and the literary world is cold. The literary school is now in decline. I remember leaving and thinking about the traveler's thoughts. Opening the letter and laughing, I thought it was not right.</p>
<p>In a certain year, the Yuanchu generation used Lin Qinnan's style to write novels. I also imitated it in jest and wrote dozens of articles. Among them, there was one titled "The Record of Leaving the Luan," which tells the story of an abandoned woman, haggard and pitiful, with no one to lend a helping hand. The meaning is sympathetic. Suddenly, Mr. Qian sent a letter from Baixia, asking about the surname, place of residence, and details of the divorced couple, and volunteered to be his partner. I told him that the matter was fictitious and only expressed my feelings. It can be seen how deeply touching words are.</p>
<p>Moving to Wu every time I swim. Good days in spring and autumn have places to stay. Where can I find good companions scattered in the stars? Not much writing records Suzhou. When I first came to Wu, I almost traveled every day, and every time I traveled, I recorded it, and every time I recorded it, I sent it to the Shen Bao for publication. The joy of the Star Society also began after the victory. Unfortunately, the day was not much, and the companions were scattered. The beautiful scenery of Suzhou has not been covered.</p>
<p>There are many fortresses and ponds around the suburbs of Wu. The inkstone has been celebrated, and the shield of Qingfeng wants to be polished. Hitting the body still urges the poetic lines to go, and I am happy that the Fenghe has not left home. Brother Shoujuan sent a letter requesting a commemorative text, saying that the sooner the better. However, the railway is interrupted, and the steamer may be delayed, so I am afraid that the good time will be missed. Therefore, I sent it by express mail.</p>
<h3>The Rule of Calmness and Thoroughness</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>Calmness means not being frivolous. Thoroughness means having definitive actions. These two words seem ordinary, but they possess immense practical value. Therefore, observing a battle necessitates "calm assessment," and taking action requires "thorough execution." Those striving for the lead must "take the initiative," and those valuing bravery should above all value "calm courage." Henceforth, our countrymen should treat national crises with myriad strategies, and adopting calmness and thoroughness as a guiding principle is undoubtedly well-founded. Do you gentlemen not remember the war reports of various newspapers after the January 28th Incident? One would say, "The enemy is attacking from several directions, but our troops are responding with calm resolve." Another would say, "The enemy is assaulting with aircraft and artillery bombardment, but our troops are responding with calm resolve." "Calmness, calmness," repeated countless times. This is because the enemy forces launched a coordinated attack by land, sea, and air, with sophisticated weaponry. Our army's equipment was somewhat inferior. The situation was nearly impossible to fight. Yet, they were still able to inflict excessive casualties, and subsequently, they executed an orderly retreat, a rare feat for any army. The effectiveness of calmness and thoroughness is immensely great. This is not merely the observation of bystanders but also the self-acknowledged sentiment of General Cai Tingkai. During the fighting, my fellow clansman Tao Jiayao visited General Cai on behalf of a legal delegation. In their conversation, the General made several remarks as follows: "Do you gentlemen not detest the internal warfare of Chinese military men? But if not for years of internal wars, the troops would lack combat experience. Where would we find such brave and calm soldiers?" Interpreting General Cai's words, calmness and thoroughness are by no means easy to achieve; they are purely derived from experience. If this is the case for warfare, why should political affairs be any different? In the future, as we strive to save the nation, we must emphasize political experience to move towards the path of calmness and thoroughness. The entire nation, from top to bottom, should divide the labor and cooperate, working diligently and earnestly. One day, we will turn defeat into success and transform misfortune into blessings. If we continue to merely paste slogans, shout slogans, issue declarations, send telegrams, settle old scores, and sing high-sounding tunes, then, truly, this humble person dares not accept such instruction. In the past, I personally witnessed the debacle of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. The majority of the people were ignorant and indifferent, which is not as heartening as the heightened national spirit of today. However, the temporary excitement and clamor of the masses are also cause for concern, for it is superficial, arrogant, and immature. Did you not see the sudden outburst of firecrackers in early March? Therefore, the period since 1894 can be called the era of ignorance, and the period after the revolution can be termed the era of clamor. From now on, we must advance to an era of calmness and thoroughness. In ten years, when the *Shen Bao* celebrates its seventieth anniversary, it can be said to be an era of success. Then, my principle will not have been offered in vain.</p>
<h3>Sixtieth Anniversary of the *Shen Bao*</h3>
<p>— Wang Tianhen</p>
<p>Life is like a white colt glimpsed through a crack. In ancient times, people often lived beyond a hundred years. Now, in the present age, those who live beyond sixty winters and summers are considered long-lived. The publication of the *Shen Bao* has spanned sixty years. I once had a strange thought. Is there anyone alive today, who is over seventy or eighty years old, who has continuously read the *Shen Bao* from its very first issue until now, without interruption, and who is still reading it daily? I fear that while there may be those who are over seventy or eighty years old, and there may be those who have read the first issue of the *Shen Bao*, and there may even be those who have read the first issue of the *Shen Bao* and are still alive today, it is almost certain that there is no one who has read it without interruption for sixty years, from the first issue to the present day. If there is, then that person is truly an old friend of the *Shen Bao* and a fine tale in the history of Chinese journalism. The *Shen Bao* was the first newspaper published in our country. This value will forever occupy the first page of the history of Chinese journalism. Therefore, today's sixtieth anniversary celebration is of great significance. In a narrow sense, it is the sixtieth anniversary of the *Shen Bao* itself, but in a broader sense, it is also the sixtieth anniversary of the existence of newspapers in China. Some people make far-fetched connections, claiming that woodblock printing flourished in the Sui Dynasty, paving the way for newspapers, and that the old *Jing Bao* was the precursor to today's newspapers. They argue that the *Shen Bao* does not deserve to be called the founder. In reality, woodblock printing and the *Jing Bao* had no direct relationship with newspapers, so they cannot be discussed in the same breath. Newspapers are printed with movable lead type. To trace the origin of newspapers, one must investigate the origins of lead type. As far as I know, the use of lead movable type in China began in the early Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty, manufactured by the East India Company. However, a fire subsequently destroyed all the type that had been created. Later, British and American missionaries came to China to spread Christianity and translated the Bible, and they began to make lead type again to print the Bible. After many years, the *Shen Bao* was born, and it has continued to this day. The use of lead type has become more widespread, and there are more and more newspapers. Just think, without lead type, how could newspapers be printed with woodblocks?</p>
<p>However, the above only discusses the fact that lead movable type predates the *Shen Bao*. In terms of newspapers, the *Shen Bao* was undoubtedly the first and original in China. Now, on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary edition of "Free Talk," I write this as a congratulation and to seek out old friends of the *Shen Bao*. If there is indeed anyone over seventy or eighty years old who has continuously read the *Shen Bao* from its very first issue until now, without interruption, and who is still reading it daily, why not write to the *Shen Bao*? I know the *Shen Bao* will sincerely welcome such a person.</p>
<h3>Three Inconceivable Matters in Shanghai</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The Nationalist Party rules the country through the Party, exercising one-party dictatorship. Ordinary people cannot even get a word in. This kind of government should be called the "Nationalist Party Government" or simply the "Party Government," which would be a true reflection of the reality. However, the current name is "National Government." Not allowing the people to participate in politics, but</p>
<p>using them as a façade. What is this logic? It is inconceivable.</p>
<p>The nation is in crisis, and the treasury is empty. The country is extremely poor. Therefore, all government agencies have been cutting staff and suspending salaries, only providing living expenses. Sometimes, even living expenses are not received. The staff members have several family members to support, without any savings. The cries of distress reach the heavens, making life worse than death. Because the nation is suffering, they endure the pain and dare not complain. Who knew that the government is not so stingy with the great figures of the Party and the nation, sending them travel expenses ranging from two to fifty thousand yuan or more. Recently, someone even rejected such a large sum. Why be generous to some and stingy to others? What is this economic principle? It is inconceivable. A woman who is both skillful and beautiful, the more you forbid men from approaching, the more they pursue her. Even when men do approach, she doesn't give them the time of day. This only makes men chase after her every day, pressing forward, undeterred by setbacks, drinking the northwest wind, and suffering the pangs of unrequited love. But she herself doesn't seem to notice. What is this attraction? It is inconceivable.</p>
<h3>My Thoughts on the *Shen Bao*</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the *Shen Bao*, Shou Juan sent a letter asking for a contribution. Due to my illness, I was delayed and missed the deadline. However, my feelings for the *Shen Bao* can be said to have grown deeper day by day from childhood until now. Forty years ago, I contributed some poems and songs to the attached supplements and received books printed from the Ju Zhen editions as gifts. At that time, I was still studying at home school, but</p>
<p>I never liked the books my teacher taught me. Instead, I liked reading the *Shen Bao* and the books it gifted.</p>
<p>At that time, the attached supplements were dedicated to publishing miscellaneous writings, and as a result, I was influenced day and night, achieving the title of a poet and songwriter.</p>
<p>I greatly envied the power of the chief editor to speak boldly about national affairs, believing that even officials who dared to remonstrate with the emperor still had many reservations and dared not express everything they wanted to say. Only the chief editor could be fearless. Therefore, my teacher often told us that a righteous friend is honest and loyal, and reading more newspapers would provide all three benefits. In the future, when you study and advance, and become an imperial censor, you should be like the chief editor, knowing everything and speaking without reservation. Acting according to what is right is essential, and one should not fail to act according to what is right simply because it is difficult. Therefore, when I was just coming of age, I was influenced by the *Shen Bao*</p>
<p>to be open to everyone and everything, and I made the word "righteous" the premise and regarded it as the key principle. When my teacher actually</p>
<p>became an imperial censor</p>
<p>, he was dismissed for impeaching powerful figures</p>
<p>. I felt greatly aggrieved on his behalf</p>
<p>and wrote an article for the *Shen Bao*, but</p>
<p>it was not published</p>
<p>. After the abolition of the civil service examination,</p>
<p>not only was the path of free speech blocked, but</p>
<p>the path to advancement was also</p>
<p>hopeless. Therefore, I changed my pseudonym to one implying that there were many things that were beyond our capabilities to change.</p>
<p>Only in fiction</p>
<p>can one act arbitrarily,</p>
<p>unrestrained.</p>
<p>Wanting something to be a certain way, it would absolutely</p>
<p>not allow others to add any opinions.</p>
<p>That is the ultimate power</p>
<p>, even more than a god.</p>
<p>Therefore, I specialized in writing novels</p>
<p>, and in that era, newspapers</p>
<p>published endless translated novels</p>
<p>, transforming the knowledge of young people.</p>
<p>So before the age of thirty, my good teachers and helpful friends</p>
<p>could be counted on one hand, with only two</p>
<p>: One was the *Shen Bao*</p>
<p>, and the other was the *Chinese Scientific Magazine*.</p>
<p>In the past, both of these newspapers</p>
<p>were printed on Chinese paper.</p>
<p>Later, the *News* began to use glossy paper</p>
<p>, and the *Shen Bao* also changed</p>
<p>until that year when it began to print on both sides of the newspaper</p>
<p>, and I became confused.</p>
<p>However, I have a feeling that</p>
<p>the changes in the times and the persuasive power of newspapers</p>
<p>have a great power to change customs and transform trends,</p>
<p>as if it were a magnet.</p>
<p>Any stubborn iron, once touched</p>
<p>, can attract another stubborn iron</p>
<p>, giving it a direction</p>
<p>so that it does not waver</p>
<p>. This kind of supreme power</p>
<p>is beyond the reach of novelists</p>
<p>, because only a few people read novels</p>
<p>, while those who read newspapers</p>
<p>spread the word from one to ten, from ten to one hundred.</p>
<p>It is easy to uplift a nation with just one word</p>
<p>. There has always been a joke that the chief editor's clumsy pen</p>
<p>is worth three thousand Mausers</p>
<p>, but in today's national defense,</p>
<p>it is a hundred times better than ten thousand airplanes</p>
<p>, because every newspaper that is distributed</p>
<p>travels thousands of miles in an instant</p>
<p>, and is spread by countless mouths.</p>
<p>Its power</p>
<p>does not necessarily have to force people</p>
<p>, but as long as one sentence hits the mark and awakens people</p>
<p>, everyone will nod in praise</p>
<p>and do their best to follow the same straight path</p>
<p>so that they do not go astray.</p>
<p>Think of this kind of grace and tool</p>
<p>in the human world.</p>
<p>Besides newspapers</p>
<p>, what else can match this?</p>
<p>Moreover, the *Shen Bao* has been accurate in its words for sixty years.</p>
<p>At least two hundred million of the four hundred million people believe in it.</p>
<p>Whenever any newspaper carries news</p>
<p>or advocates a strategy</p>
<p>, when it spreads among the people,</p>
<p>they always say that this is what the *Shen Bao* said.</p>
<p>If the news is inaccurate</p>
<p>or the proposal is wrong,</p>
<p>people will say,</p>
<p>after all, the *Shen Bao* never said it that way.</p>
<p>Therefore, the *Shen Bao*'s position among the people,</p>
<p>whenever it gives guidance</p>
<p>, it is as if a father is instructing his son or a brother is instructing his younger brother</p>
<p>, and the views of the people on the *Shen Bao*</p>
<p>may differ depending on their age</p>
<p>, but in terms of the *Shen Bao*'s age,</p>
<p>the sixty-year-old is in charge</p>
<p>and can be considered an elder</p>
<p>with the possibility of bossing people around.</p>
<p>An old saying says that if someone is twice your age,</p>
<p>treat him as a father; if he is ten years older,</p>
<p>treat him as an older brother; if he is five years older, then follow him.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think the general public's view of the *Shen Bao* is the same.</p>
<p>Now three thousand Mausers</p>
<p>have become useless</p>
<p>, and ten thousand airplanes</p>
<p>are difficult to obtain suddenly.</p>
<p>Therefore, our national defense depends</p>
<p>on the unity of the people</p>
<p>to achieve the goal of being both prosperous and strong.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion,</p>
<p>the easiest way to achieve this</p>
<p>is to promote domestic goods</p>
<p>so that everyone in our country has a steady job</p>
<p>, and everyone can have a steady mind</p>
<p>to achieve a stable property,</p>
<p>so that they will not have the panic of unemployment</p>
<p>or have insane phenomena</p>
<p>, and the communist attempts</p>
<p>will not shake people's hearts.</p>
<p>Therefore, my hope for the *Shen Bao* is that</p>
<p>it will exercise its power as an elder</p>
<p>and quickly switch the newspaper to Chinese paper.</p>
<p>Although the price of paper is expensive,</p>
<p>but being cheap hurts farmers.</p>
<p>Following this precedent</p>
<p>, the advertising fees can be changed to a progressive system</p>
<p>to reduce the aggression of capitalists.</p>
<p>Even if the selling price is changed to nine cents,</p>
<p>it will only cost the intellectual class</p>
<p>an extra yuan a month.</p>
<p>People who seek knowledge</p>
<p>will definitely not be stingy with this small amount.</p>
<p>Even textbooks, why</p>
<p>can't they be like this?</p>
<p>Because people who read newspapers</p>
<p>will definitely not buy them just because they are cheap.</p>
<p>If you think that cheap and good quality means that you have to use foreign goods,</p>
<p>then the two words "prosperity" and "strength"</p>
<p>can only be given to foreigners to specialize in.</p>
<p>I have long wanted to contribute this point of view,</p>
<p>because it seems like untimely advice.</p>
<p>Now it feels that there are more and more unemployed people.</p>
<p>The paper mills in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi have already closed</p>
<p>many,</p>
<p>abandoning good bamboo materials</p>
<p>on the ground</p>
<p>with no one to buy them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, paper mills believe that they must use foreign materials</p>
<p>to manufacture newspapers.</p>
<p>This kind of phenomenon</p>
<p>is really very dangerous.</p>
<p>Farmers and workers are unemployed,</p>
<p>leading to nothing to do.</p>
<p>Naturally, it creates a trend like a tiger escaping from its cage or jade being destroyed in its case</p>
<p>. Sixty years from now,</p>
<p>I don't know how the four hundred million people of our country</p>
<p>will survive.</p>
<p>I am afraid that they will have long been enslaved</p>
<p>and specially make cattle and horses for foreigners.</p>

<p>*Shen Bao* Local Supplement</p>
<h3>Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a 93-Year-Old Man in Shanghai, Expresses His Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Ling Qihan</p>
<p>To commemorate the 60th anniversary of this newspaper, I, the reporter, made a special visit to Mr. Xiang, and we talked for two full mornings. His conversations were both serious and humorous, and contained profound meaning within their simplicity. He told me that when Kang Youwei met him, he asked, "What methods can be used to change young people?" He said, "In ancient times, the Romans used two methods to influence people: drama and novels." He wanted to use the attitude of drama and novels to influence our youth. Unfortunately, my note-taking skills are too poor, and I didn't have time to ask Mr. Xiang to revise it, which I deeply regret. In short, the highlights of the article are all from Mr. Xiang's dictation, and the shortcomings are the responsibility of the reporter. – April 29th</p>

<p>Eight Hundred Million Hands</p>
<p>Steamer "Confucius"</p>
<p>My memory has deteriorated. I really can't provide a systematic narrative anymore. Alas! It's truly a dream… I arrived in Shanghai in the first year of Xianfeng (1851). At that time, I saw mostly sailing ships at the Wusongkou port, about nine out of ten foreign warships were sailing ships. It was rumored that in the early years of Daoguang (1820s), Western steamers were already transporting grain to Beijing, but this is incorrect. The first steamer I saw was the customs inspection vessel, the "Confucius." It can be seen that Westerners at that time still respected Chinese culture very much. The steamers at that time were all "paddle steamers rather than screw steamers."</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the American Flag</p>
<p>Speaking of steamers, it reminds me of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Around the ninth year of Guangxu (1883), the situation in Annam (Vietnam) triggered the Sino-French War. Before the Battle of Lang Son, Li Hongzhang received information that French warships would blockade the Yangtze River, making it impossible for the China Merchants ships to pass. Therefore, he instructed my Third Uncle Mei, who was the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to discuss the matter with the Gibb, Livingston &amp; Co. (Qichang) trading house. The American in Gibb, Livingston &amp; Co. was a friend of Old Third (Mei), so he agreed to fly the American flag. At that time, rumors outside were saying that China Merchants had been sold to the Americans, but this was Li Hongzhang's quick thinking. He wrote two contracts, one public and one secret. The public contract said it was a sale, and the secret contract said it was a request to fly the flag. Three days after the contracts were signed, the war broke out, and the China Merchants ships flew the American flag, finally allowing them to move freely. At that time, China had no coastal defense at all, and it had to resort to temporarily requesting to fly a foreign flag for protection, which was so shameful. Later, I represented Uncle Mei in Tianjin to reclaim the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Sheng Xingsun wanted to reclaim Gibb, Livingston &amp; Co., but Mr. Smith (Shi Mi Te) refused, saying that since the initial negotiations were conducted by a Mr. Ma, the reclamation negotiations should also be conducted by a Mr. Ma. Therefore, I represented Uncle Mei and negotiated with Smith in front of Li Hongzhang, and without spending a single coin, I managed to reclaim the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. At that time, rumors said that Mr. Ma had made a fortune of sixty million, but in reality, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had a deficit of over twelve million taels, all bad debts!</p>
<p>The Pawn Brokerage on Steamships</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was that the employees on the ships, from the compradors to the tea servers, did not receive salaries. Not only did they not receive salaries, but they also had to pay pawn deposits (押櫃). The company required the compradors to pay pawn deposits, the compradors required the tea servers to pay pawn deposits, and the tea servers required the sailors to pay pawn deposits. This layer upon layer of exploitation ultimately harmed the passengers. Therefore, it was not surprising that a comprador could earn two or three thousand taels of silver on a single trip down the Yangtze River. Passengers could overcharge and the price of wine was ridiculously expensive. The company saved on salaries and let them steal and rob as they pleased, not caring about anything.</p>
<p>Official Reimbursements</p>
<p>Alas! This is the inferior nature of the Chinese nation. The people are like this, and the officials are even worse. At that time, the Shanghai Daotai (道台) only had to report five hundred thousand taels of silver to the imperial court each year. Anything more or less went into the Daotai's pockets. This kind of contracted politics was a characteristic of Chinese politics. At that time, a prefecture or county was required to report a fixed amount, and if they couldn't come up with it, they had to make up for it. After they paid it, everything else was their benefit. Therefore, the common people were poor, and only officials could get rich. There was also a clever trick for officials to get rich, which was to report famine (報荒). If the year was slightly bad, they would report famine to the higher authorities, and the higher authorities would approve a reduction in land tax by a certain percentage. Thus, the money that had already been collected but not deducted all went into their pockets.</p>
<p>The Holy Sage Kang's Brothel Debts</p>
<p>Speaking of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company reminds me of a very interesting story about Kang Youwei. It turned out that Kang Youwei was heavily indebted to brothels in the early years of Guangxu (1870s). At that time, he had to rush to the capital for the spring examination (春闈), and he finally boarded a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship. His brothel debts had not been paid, and the creditors chased him onto the ship to demand payment. Kang Youwei, in a moment of quick thinking, hid in the life raft on the roof of the ship and managed to evade his debts. This was one of Kang Youwei's tricks, showing that literati were often unkempt. In fact, Kang Youwei was not as good as Liang Qichao. Kang's reputation came from "Examination of Forged Classics (偽經考)," which he had actually plagiarized from Fang Wangxi.</p>
<p>Red Turbans and the City</p>
<p>I have been in Shanghai since the winter of the first year of Xianfeng (1851), which is now eighty-two years. Two years later, I went to Nanjing for the provincial examination (鄉試). When the results were announced, the capital was already in turmoil due to the Hong Yang rebellion. In the third year (1853), the Red Turbans rioted and soon occupied Shanghai. In February of the fifth year (1855), the Red Turbans withdrew. In the eighth year (1858), Chuansha, Nanhui, Nanxiang, and Baoshan fell, and Shanghai was occupied by the "Red Turbans." At that time, the Manchus of Longhua (龍華) shelled the city of Shanghai, and the "Red Turbans" in the city also shelled the outside of the city. At that time, the city of Shanghai was extremely lively. The shops in the area of the Great East Gate (大東門) were all magnificent. As soon as you entered the Little East Gate (小東門), there was a hat shop called "Lu Zhengda (陸正大)," which was very famous. I even bought a hat there. The Guangdong Guild Hall (廣東會館) and the Tianfei Temple (天妃宮) were both outside the Little East Gate. At that time, the Catholic church in Dongjiadu (董家渡) had not yet been built.</p>
<p>The Beginning of Shanghai's Prosperity</p>
<p>During the Hong Yang rebellion, the stones from the dikes along the Hushu Pass (滸墅關) outside the Yan Gate (閻門) of Suzhou were all removed by people from north of the Yangtze River and sold to Shanghainese to build houses. When I first came to Shanghai, there wasn't a single Western-style house and not a single road. The consulates were all in one building called "Twenty-Four Rooms (二十四間)," located at the foot of the Tianfei Temple Bridge. I watched Shanghai's development day by day. At that time, only the Fourth Road (四馬路) and Sixth Road (六馬路) were built and then destroyed. Hongkou had not yet prospered. The Great Road (大馬路) only extended to the Nicheng Bridge (泥城橋), which was still very desolate in the early years of Guangxu. The most bustling center was on the Fourth Road. The land price was at most eight hundred yuan per mu (畝), and the rent for a three-story building was only twelve yuan. Xingsheng Street (興聖街) was originally my family's property, and the rent for a building was six yuan, which was considered a very high interest rate. At that time, one yuanbao (元寳) (worth seventy-five yuan) could build a one-story building for rent. There was only a "Public Association (公會)" in the concession, and no police station. There were very few police officers. The insurance business had not yet developed. There was no property insurance or marine insurance. Speaking of transportation tools in Shanghai, there were horse-drawn carriages first, and then rickshaws (東洋車). At that time, there were very few horse-drawn carriages, and they were all privately owned.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Railways</p>
<p>The construction of the railway in Shanghai began around the early years of Guangxu (1870s). The first railway built was the one from Shanghai to Wusong. At that time, Liu Mingchuan (劉銘傑) submitted a memorial to request the construction of the railway, and I wrote that memorial. Later, the imperial court issued an edict saying that when the train was running, the wind along the road would be strong. In the West, where the land is vast and the population is sparse, it doesn't matter, but in China, where the land is narrow and the population is dense, the houses within fifty or sixty li along the railway could be blown down by the train wind. Therefore, the area within fifty or sixty li along the railway would have to be incorporated into the railway area. Later, when the Germans built the railway in Shandong, they used the excuse of the railway area to occupy the mines along the railway. Therefore, foreigners' encroachment on the rights of the Chinese people was mostly due to our own confusion. Even now, Japan is using the excuse of protecting the South Manchurian Railway area in the Northeast and has stationed troops there. Not only that, but they have already occupied the entire Northeast.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Telegraphs</p>
<p>The establishment of the telegraph was initially handled by Gibb, Livingston &amp; Co. (其昌洋行). Telegraph poles were erected all the way from the Jinliyuan Bank (金利源棧房) to the British concession. At that time, my younger brother, Uncle Mei, submitted a regulation on telegraphs, solicited shares, and handled the matter. Sheng Xingsun was the general manager. The establishment fee was recognized by the state, and the pole fee was recognized by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The shares that Sheng Xingsun subscribed for himself were all verbal promises of dry shares. Therefore, Sheng Xingsun's wealth mostly came from the public, and it cannot be said that it came from the people. Compared to the current general bureaucrats who shamelessly directly exploit the people, he was already one step ahead.</p>
<p>The Ingenious Method of Getting Rich by Erecting Telegraph Poles</p>
<p>Speaking of telegraphs, it reminds me of the telegraph poles. The employees of the telegraph bureau could use the name of erecting telegraph poles to get rich. At that time, the people were very superstitious and believed that erecting telegraph poles in front of their doors would ruin their feng shui (風水). Therefore, the people in the telegraph bureau intentionally erected telegraph poles in front of people's doors. Some people hated it, and some people were afraid of ruining their feng shui, so they had to ask the telegraph bureau to intercede. Therefore, the people in the bureau bargained with the people, and bribery was rampant. This was the root of the people's resentment towards Sheng Xingsun.</p>
<p>The Mixed Court</p>
<p>Speaking of the Mixed Court, it was created in the early years of Tongzhi (1860s). At that time, the Shanghai Daotai wanted to be lazy and was willing to share authority with the foreign consuls. Later, the foreign consuls took the position of presiding judge, while the Chinese officials took the position of co-judge. In the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu (1902), they signed a contract with the foreign ministers, recognizing the foreign consuls' judicial power over Chinese people in the concession. From then on, the Chinese jurors were further reduced to the same status as the Chinese and foreign interpreters. This point should be blamed on Zeng Guofan's lack of understanding. In the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), because of the Li Huangshi case (黎黄氏一案), the Chinese and foreign interpreters were slapped by the consuls, which aroused public outrage and led to a strike. I also felt very unfair for the Mixed Court officials. The Chinese people have never understood diplomacy and are not familiar with foreign affairs. In fact, Zeng Guofan's handling of foreign affairs was far inferior to Li Hongzhang, and Lin Zexu was only slightly better in his intentions, but he also did not fully understand foreign affairs. In the matter of banning opium, he only knew how to argue with British merchants and did not think about directly negotiating with the British government. Later, the war that was triggered can only be said to be a war with British merchants.</p>
<p>The Story of Opium</p>
<p>Speaking of opium, it was also banned in the early years of Guangxu. At that time, Li Hongzhang sent my younger brother, Uncle Mei, to India to negotiate. The Indian government agreed to gradually reduce exports to China each year, and China would increase tariffs each year. It was stipulated that all opium would be transported for official sale. Later, China felt embarrassed about official sales, so it transferred the task to foreign customs officials to handle it. As a result, it only lasted for half a year before it stopped invisibly. The reason was that the British sent people to China to investigate and said that China had not eradicated the plant itself! In short, things that the Chinese were clearly justified in doing ultimately disappeared without a trace and yielded no results.</p>
<p>Shen Bao is My Younger Brother</p>
<p>Time passes quickly. Shen Bao is also sixty years old. Older than Shen Bao is the Jing Bao (京報). I myself have preserved it for over twenty years. Unfortunately, the staff of the Xujiahui Library did not recognize its value and burned it in a fire, thinking it was waste paper. Although Shen Bao has reached its sixtieth year, it is still my younger brother. The situation in Shanghai for the past sixty years can be described as a sea change, and the state affairs are even worse. Is there anything that Shen Bao has recorded in these sixty years that is not heartbreaking? Comparing the current prosperity of Shanghai with that of sixty years ago, the surface naturally seems to have progressed, but has there been any real progress in its essence? Let's take the few things we've talked about haphazardly. How is the shipping industry doing? How are the railways doing? The corruption of corrupt officials is even more lawless than before. The opium ghosts are more numerous than before. In its essence, Shanghai has only regressed, not progressed. In fact, what is the basis of Shanghai's superficial prosperity?</p>
<p>Colonial Rule vs. Closed-Door Rule</p>
<p>I have often secretly wondered why the Chinese are inferior to foreigners in everything, why the West is strong and China is weak. I have finally imagined that there is nothing mysterious about it. Originally, the only difference between China and the West is one point. That is, China's politics is closed-door politics, and the West's politics is colonial politics. Because China's politics is closed-door politics, the emperor does not allow the people to have any nationalistic ideas. Even now, the party government does not allow the people to interfere in politics. Because China is a closed-door politics, the general public only knows how to pledge allegiance to an emperor and does not ask about anything else. Even now, the general politicians are still full of imperial ideas and only know how to fight for supreme power. The Chinese civil officials are ignorant of literature. Their memorials to the emperor are full of extremely flattering words. Even now, they still want to take one person's opinion as an irrefutable truth to suppress others.</p>
<p>Western Expansion</p>
<p>Westerners are different. They are influenced by religion and know that all human beings are equal before the creator. They know that politics is their own business. They have long had the spirit of opening up new territories. Spain went to visit the Americas, and Portugal went to the Far East. Macau was taken by Portugal, and even China itself did not know about it. Later, after it was taken, it was negotiated with Portugal, and it was finally agreed to pay five hundred taels of silver annually as rent. Now, even the name of these five hundred taels has been cancelled. In the early years of Guangxu, Weihaiwei was lost. At that time, the Shandong Yamen (衙門) did not even have a map and did not know where Weihaiwei was. With great difficulty, I found a small map in a church and discovered the location of Weihaiwei.</p>
<p>The Closed-Minded Chinese Emperors and Their Thinking</p>
<p>The West is a colonial rule, so they at least have the concept of protecting their territory. China is a closed-door rule, so the people not only have no nationalistic ideas, but also no concept of loving their territory. The people only know how to cultivate the land, pay taxes to the emperor, and the emperor only knows how to live extravagantly and enjoy the world for himself alone. China has no concept of colonialism at all, so when the Chinese get many places in Southeast Asia, they want to build three palaces and six courtyards as soon as they become leaders, putting on the airs of an emperor, so that overseas Chinese have no choice but to reach out to foreigners to seek protection. Even a small Ryukyu king wants to enjoy the power and blessings of three palaces and six courtyards. Ryukyu finally perished. Now, I don't know how many corrupt officials are full of official arrogance, nothing more than the epitome of the emperor's air. In fact, Japan is also like this. However, the Japanese are good at imitation. They have learned some of the flavor of Western colonial politics and want to come to China to test it. The knowledge of the Japanese is not very high. I am very unconvinced, but they are very serious about small things, which is their advantage. When I went to Japan, it was in the early years of Guangxu. We had already ceded Taiwan to them. At that time, there were very few new schools in Japan. I personally saw Americans accompanying Japanese princes to visit Europe and the United States. The overseas Chinese in Japan told me that the Japanese regarded the Chinese as high monks. Children who were touched by the hands of Chinese would have great blessings. The Japanese were even more respectful to Chinese officials and scholars. How is it now? Now the Japanese have openly scolded us as an "unorganized country" and treat us like savages. In fact, the Japanese have only learned some Western superficialities. They are far inferior to foreigners. When foreigners fight, they have to prepare several years of food and grass. Japan wants to start a war without sufficient preparation. Japan is really arrogant.</p>
<p>Desperate Escape and Shanghai's Prosperity</p>
<p>Getting back to the point, China's politics is closed-door politics, so the people only know that the world belongs to the emperor alone, and they absolutely do not know that the land belongs to the people. Therefore, they live and reside without knowing how to love the source of their living and residence. Now the emperor is gone, but the poison of the closed door still exists. The Chinese people's concept of loving their territory is still very weak. Therefore, when there is foreign aggression, they want to abandon the land and escape, and there is absolutely no thought of defending the land and resisting. The Chinese only know how to desperately escape. They desperately escape to Shanghai during civil wars and desperately escape to Shanghai during foreign aggressions. Thus, Shanghai has developed day by day. The prosperity of Shanghai is the result of the collision and accumulation of Western colonial rule and Chinese closed-door rule. A history of Shanghai's prosperity is a history of China's heartbreak.</p>
<p>With Democracy, There Will Be No Traitors</p>
<p>When I went to the West in the tenth year of Guangxu (1884), no country's people were as poor and miserable as the Chinese people. Now the Chinese peasants are even poorer and more miserable. However, it is not enough to advocate governing the country through agriculture. It is necessary to actively promote colonial politics, and colonial politics must start from democracy. It is necessary to make the people know that politics is their own business and the land is their own land, and then they can cultivate the concept of loving the territory. With democracy, there will be no traitors.</p>
<p>Three Regrets in Life</p>
<p>I have three regrets in my life, all of which are caused by the unbreakable closed-door thinking.</p>
<p>The first regret is that Korea did not become a neutral country. At that time, Japan hated Russia. As long as China and Russia agreed, it could be implemented. However, the imperial court was still reluctant to give up its status as the suzerain state, so nothing could be said to the court. At that time, Korea's annual tribute cost 800,000 gold in hospitality expenses for local officials along the way, and they were still unwilling to give it up even after the Daewongun (大院君) made trouble.</p>
<p>The second regret is that when Japan seized Taiwan in the thirteenth year of Tongzhi (1874), China did not dare to fight. I submitted several memorials, but Liu Shengsan (劉省三) dared not do it. At that time, we had forty merchant ships that could trade with Taiwan and twenty warships to protect them. Japan's strength was far less than ours, but we still dared not. This kind of cowardly spirit has continued to this day, creating a thorough policy of non-resistance.</p>
<p>The third regret is that I did not open Kowloon as a free port. Because once Kowloon is opened as a free port, goods can enter and exit without paying customs duties, then the opposite Hong Kong will soon collapse. I once submitted a memorial to buy 100,000 mu of land to open a trading port, but the imperial court ignored it.</p>
<p>Closed-Door Thinking Ruined the Common People</p>
<p>I think back and forth, and closed-door thinking has ruined our common people. The non-disclosure of politics is the closed door to the inside. Rights can be given away with both hands, and legitimate exchanges are ignored. This is the closed door to the outside. In times of crisis, the government always only knows how to play the game of using barbarians to control barbarians. If we want to save China, we must first break this closed-door thinking and start from democracy. China's so-called "big family" is actually a "small family" because the Chinese people only know that they have a family, and do not know that they have a village, do not know that they have a county, do not know that they have a province, and do not know that they have a country. China must create a large family of farmers and workers, organize it with a scientific spirit, and ensure that there is vigilance internally and national defense externally, always protecting the land where we live and reside.</p>
<p>Eight Hundred Million Hands</p>
<p>When William II toured the Far East, he looked at Shanghai from the Huangpu River and sighed, "This country has four hundred million people, eight hundred million hands. Once they rise up, who can resist them?" Although I am old, my spirit is not old. I am still excited and can't help but hope that the eight hundred million hands will quickly rise up and extend to the outer seas.</p>
<p>End of Conversation</p>
<h3>A Little History of the Reporter at This Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Uncle Tong</p>
<p>Today marks the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of this newspaper. Originally, we should have celebrated with a grand birthday celebration. However, in the face of national crisis, we are unwilling to engage in extravagance and boastful displays. Yet, as a reporter who has served this newspaper for many years, I feel obliged to write some words of praise to wish it well. However, I am not skilled at writing eulogies, nor am I familiar with the sixty-year history of this newspaper. I have no choice but to write a disorganized and nonsensical piece about my relationship with this newspaper, hoping to add a little something to the occasion.</p>
<p>I, the reporter, have been the editor of this publication only recently, from January 7th to April 30th of this year, a total of only four months. And in the middle of those four months, operations were suspended for two months due to the battles in Zhabei and Wusong. In reality, I have only been working in Shanghai for a little over two months, making me like a newborn child to this sixty-year-old elder, named Ah Chi.</p>
<p>However, if we count the years I have served at this newspaper, on and off, it adds up to quite a few. In the twenty-eighth year of the Guangxu reign, when Jin Junjianhua held the editorial pen, I also served as a reporter. Besides writing a few essays in the style of student exercises, I also edited a few news reports. At that time, reports were often collected by one person and used by another (meaning submissions today were used tomorrow). Cases of fire and theft were considered important news. The newspaper's address was across from the Red Church on Hankou Road (the current site of the former Municipal Council). The office was accessed through a narrow alley and consisted of only two rooms. A smaller room was the chief editor's office, and a larger room was the reporters' office. There were about four or five reporters in total, who mostly worked during the day. After reading the newspapers, they would have dinner. The typesetting room was upstairs across a small alley. Manuscripts were passed through a small tin can using hemp string, similar to the money transfer systems used by large businesses today.</p>
<p>At that time, the translator of Western newspapers was Yan Jun Junqing, the brother of Yan Huiqing, the current chief representative of our country to the League of Nations. He had a limp, carried a walking stick, and had a scar on his forehead. He would arrive late in the evening, and his translations had to be written down by another reporter because he did not write himself, not because he couldn't, but because he didn't want to. In about half an hour, he would translate five or six Western news wires and leave. Lei Jun Junyao often served as the scribe. At that time, Sheng Xingsheng, the Commercial Commissioner, was negotiating the construction of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway with the British. Shen Jun Jingxian believed that it was a loss of rights and benefits and wrote articles criticizing Sheng as much as possible. Sheng initially tried to bribe him with large sums of money without success and then resorted to threats. At that time, the press's authority could still maintain its dignified position.</p>
<p>At that time, the reporter only worked at the newspaper for a few months because he wanted to study right-to-left writing and resigned. In the thirty-second year of Guangxu, he worked at the Southern Newspaper, located at the intersection of Fourth Road and Jiangxi Road. The manager was Cai Hefu, who had served as the Shanghai Daotai, and the director was Zhi Jun Zanxi, named Rui Guang, the brother of Consort Zhen of the Guangxu Emperor. Later, because of the publication of an article about Prince Zhen taking the famous actress Yang Cuixi as a concubine, a great uproar erupted. The life of the Southern Newspaper lasted only a little over a year and was sacrificed to Yang Cuixi. At that time, the manager of the Shen Bao, Xi Jun Zipei, invited me to join, and I could not refuse. So, in June of that year, I returned to the Shen Bao. At that time, the Shen Bao's address had moved to Wangping Street, the current site of the Zhongxi Bookstore (later it moved to the current site of the Shishi Xinbao). At that time, Xu Xilin had just assassinated Enming, the Governor of Anhui, and the female knight Qiu Jin was martyred in Shaoxing. The revolutionary forces were spreading like wildfire, and the government was sending out secret police to arrest party members, which seems futile in retrospect. I discussed publishing a book about Xu Xilin with my colleagues in the office, and everyone strongly agreed. The book sold out within a few days of publication. In recent times, every event has a dedicated book. Xu Xilin can be said to have been able to respond to the trends of the times. In addition to writing articles, I also had to edit the news and was responsible for proofreading, so the work was very intense. However, everything was completed by about eleven o'clock at the latest. Across from the Shen Bao was the Zhongwai Daily, founded by Wang Jun Zhongge. Although Wang Jun was hard of hearing, he was very energetic in running the newspaper. At that time, no newspaper had a dedicated telegram section. Wang Jun specially sought telegram reporters and offered bonuses for exclusive telegrams. Therefore, the existence of exclusive telegrams in newspapers today originated with Wang Jun. Later, the newspaper was suppressed by the authorities for excessively attacking the government and eventually ceased operations. From then on, the freedom of speech was somewhat restricted. In the years of Xuantong, I resigned and rested due to liver yang disease (called brain disease by Western doctors). The newspaper office did not agree and continued to pay my original salary for a year and a half before I firmly resigned from the paid position. The newspaper treated me very well.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic, Cheng Xuelou, the Jiangsu Military Governor, extended an invitation to run the Jiangsu Public Newspaper. By nature, I do not like to enter politics. The name of the newspaper was Collection of Discussions, and there was nothing to do. I only wanted to use it for recuperation from illness and was not willing. The following year, the Second Revolution broke out. One day, I got up early, and a colleague said to me in dismay, "The situation is critical! Wu Shaolin, the secretary of the Nanjing fortress, was killed, and Governor Cheng was surrounded. Huang Xing knelt in front of Cheng Xuelou and firmly asked him to sign." Cheng remained silent. Fearing that something would happen in Nanjing, that evening, I and my colleagues from the Public Newspaper packed our bedding and returned home. In the third year of the Republic, I joined the Xinwen Bao for about a year. Later, I resigned at the same time as Wu Jun Shu Yun and Zhou Jun Mengxiong in opposition to Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor.</p>
<p>Afterward, I served in the education field, eating "open rice" every day and making a living as a performer for five or six years. When I first entered Pudong Middle School, the May Fourth Movement was in full swing, and the students' arrogance was rampant. Slogans such as "Expel so-and-so teacher" were plastered on the school walls everywhere. Banners refusing so-and-so teacher's classes were flying in the air. Students were shouting and pacing, advocating for a long-term strike. Principal Zhu Shuyuan insisted on resuming classes. Both sides were very active in their positions. I mediated between them and proposed a compromise, and the storm passed safely. Later, I taught Chinese at Shanghai University. My spleen and stomach disease broke out badly. According to the doctor, I could no longer work in the education field; otherwise, my life would be in danger. I had no choice but to resign midway. In the eleventh year of the Republic, I joined this newspaper again. By then, this office had become the most modern building, the current Shen Bao building. Counting the years, it has been ten years in a flash. Recalling the first time I joined the Shen Bao, the scale was extraordinarily small. The second time I joined the Shen Bao, the scope had expanded. And the third time I joined the Shen Bao, it was magnificent and dignified, no longer comparable to the old Shen Bao. Therefore, the first time was the Shen Bao's infancy, the second time was the Shen Bao's youth, and the third time was the Shen Bao's prime. Every time I joined the Shen Bao, the Shen Bao grew larger. Newspapers are the driving force of culture, and the progress of national culture is directly proportional to newspapers. In the future, as culture advances daily, the future of this newspaper will be unlimited, and the responsibilities it bears will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of this newspaper. Although I have served this newspaper for less than twenty years in total, I can still be considered an old servant of this office. Today, for the sixtieth birthday of my master, I, as an old palace maid, tell a story of the Tang Palace and write a small piece of history as a celebration.</p>
<p>Just Chatting</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Shen Bao's Birthday</h3>
<p>— Cowherd</p>
<p>The Shen Bao has been published for exactly sixty years now. Based on its age and qualifications, it should naturally have a grand celebration for its sixtieth anniversary, with a big, extravagant, and lively event. However, during this time of national crisis, everything emphasizes frugality, so it is just a simple ceremony, like people having a small birthday. They invite people to eat two bowls of longevity noodles to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Shen Bao's age, young people like us should at least call it "Old Uncle." And this old uncle is a knowledgeable and experienced person. 365 days a year, he tirelessly provides guidance, teaching us the ways of life. Therefore, we are close to it every day. In fact, it has long become our good teacher and helpful friend.</p>
<p>Looking back over the past sixty years, I don't know how many thousands of newspapers have been published, but most have unfortunately died young. The Shen Bao, with its long history, can be said to be the surviving spirit of the Lu palace, standing alone. I think the Shen Bao must be looking back at the vicissitudes of life and feeling both happy and proud amidst the celebrations.</p>
<p>I am an untalented young man who has known the Shen Bao for ten years. However, a person becomes weaker with age, while a newspaper becomes stronger. I know that in a few decades, humanity will not escape metabolism, but the spirit of the newspaper will become more and more innovative, developing infinitely.</p>
<p>In fact, to bring it back to the point, Chinese newspapers are still in their infancy. Even a newspaper with the oldest qualifications and the largest circulation like the Shen Bao only sells less than 200,000 copies per day. Compared to European and American newspapers that sell over a million copies per day, the difference is significant. Even compared to the Asahi Shimbun of the small island nation of Japan, we can't help but feel inferior. So, how can the Shen Bao not pull itself together and work hard to strive? Old Shen, old Shen, hurry up and work hard!</p>
<p>A Glimpse</p>
<h3>The Birthday of Old Man Shen</h3>
<p>— You Yuanping</p>
<p>One clear morning, silvery sunlight streamed through the gauze curtains, and sparse shadows of trees were reflected on the window, forming a beautiful picture. Hua's mother was busy searching for something, and clothes for going out were piled haphazardly on the sofa.</p>
<p>"Hua, get up quickly! Today is Old Uncle Shen's birthday. Get up and get ready to offer him congratulations!" his mother called out.</p>
<p>Hua rubbed his eyes and sat up, his face covered with a smile, symbolizing that this joyous and congratulatory day had arrived. At the corner of ×× Road, colorful arches towered, and colored light bulbs flickered on the frames, reflecting points of light. Vehicles lined up in an orderly manner, and the entering and exiting guests all wore expressions of joy.</p>
<p>Although there were so many guests, it made him even more excited and more sincere and harmonious in interacting with the guests. Indeed, he was a full sixty years old, a grand celebration for sixty years. However, looking at his robustness, he still seemed to be in his prime. Although his robustness was like that of a prime-aged man, his competence and reputation grew year by year along with his past diligence and age, becoming larger and larger.</p>
<p>Gradually, more and more guests arrived, so Old Man Shen's busyness in interacting with guests became directly proportional to the number of guests, sometimes making him unable to stop.</p>
<p>The sun was setting so fast, in an instant turning from sunset to afterglow, and then even the afterglow disappeared, replaced by the massive amount of light illuminating all parts of the hall. Under the massive illumination of the lights, the noisy laughter accompanied the shining light.</p>
<p>After dinner, most of the guests returned one after another, with only a few close relatives reluctant to suddenly leave this rare grand gathering, still continuing to talk and laugh casually there.</p>
<p>The curtain of night enveloped the scene. The clock indicated that the night had gradually deepened. Therefore, even the relatives who were reluctant to leave suddenly had to withdraw. As they withdrew, under the illumination of the colored electric lights, they could still see Old Man Shen's robust silhouette bathed in the interlacing colors of red and purple.</p>
<p>East, West, North, South</p>
<h3>The Year of Sixty</h3>
<p>— Smoke Shadow</p>
<p>"Alas! How could I have seen such a cruel massacre!" said a robust old man.</p>
<p>This old man had just turned sixty this year. He had personally experienced many disturbances. In the village where he lived, fierce disputes could often be seen occurring. However, the most shameful and heartbreaking was nothing more than this time of being bullied by people from another village. This bullying was the most cruel and violent, killing and setting fires more barbaric than any savage nation, more evil than any demon.</p>
<p>He was a fair and just man, and the people of the whole village tacitly agreed that he could guide and help them, no matter what the matter. He also believed that he had spent a lot of energy and effort in the interests and development of the whole village.</p>
<p>"If the authoritative figures in this village all entrusted their lives to their own careers, if they absolutely did not cause discord and were willing to work together harmoniously, how could the current state of the village have fallen to such a point?" He was extremely grief-stricken. He thought that the weakness caused by internal strife often told people this way. Usually, his vision was very sharp, and his will was very far-reaching. How many times had he expressed such advice and such enthusiasm? Although some people could not do what he said.</p>
<p>But he was not at all desperate, not at all discouraged. Don't you see him shouting loudly even more vigorously? He wished that the whole village would be integrated into one whole mind and body, preparing to work hard and move forward to defeat our enemies. He knew that his sixty-year process was only a small part of his life. The period after that will be longer than the past several times, dozens of times, hundreds of times... Of course, he will not change his ambition and will still advance together with the villagers, creating that glorious era!</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
<h3>Mother's Wish</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>This baby's mother has been a beggar since yesterday.</p>
<p>On this not-so-bustling street, she sat tightly against the high wall. Her face was yellow and thin, her eyes deeply sunken, completely devoid of the color that a young woman should have. From her troubled face, you could know that she only felt infinite emptiness, even believing that human life had reached its end. Now, everything about her was over, leaving only the unbearable hunger, the last tears, the last breath, and the pain in her lower body and the dry baby in her arms who was crying from hunger.</p>
<p>This small life, which had not been born for long, emitted weak cries almost endlessly. Although the mother carefully put the sagging breast with no milk into his small mouth, he was still crying in disappointment. Because of this hateful crying, it added to her distress, and she even wished to pile all her resentment onto this baby's fate, because this child's birth had brought this disaster.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>About a month ago, when this child was just born, she heard the close-knit gunfire near her home in Zhabei. So she had to lie on the floor in a panic, bloodied. The next day, the third day continued, with no hope of stopping the war, only crying with her dockworker husband. A week later, her husband had to sneak out to hide it from her in order to get food for the family, but he didn't come back in the evening, and he never came back. So she felt that most of her life was gone except for crying all day long. One morning a few days later, a group of soldiers in helmets broke down her door and broke in, forcibly held her down and took off her underwear, and she was. She was willing to die immediately from the unbearable pain. About two hours later, when she woke up, there was still only herself and the newborn baby in the house, but her lower body was bleeding profusely. At this time, she could have committed suicide, but in order to wait for her husband or to leave a piece of her husband's flesh for him, she still couldn't die and stayed until now...</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Passing "benevolent gentlemen" scattered a few copper coins in front of her, clanging loudly. The hungry baby continued to cry in hunger.</p>
<p>"Don't cry! Little darling, I'm about to die of hunger myself. Where would I have milk for you to eat?" Bean-sized tears fell on the baby's face.</p>
<p>"Child! I hope you can grow up by luck! Your parents still want you... to avenge… your… parents…"</p>
