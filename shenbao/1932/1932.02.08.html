<h3>如何與日軍作持久之抗爭彬</h3>
<p>日軍爲欲發揮其帝國主義對外掠奪之野心。并爭取太平洋上之覇權。其處心積慮以謀我。自甲午以來如一朝。去年九一八東北禍變及此次上海事件。特不過其野心之具體暴露與行動之開端。故中日兩國之對立今後必日益尖銳。假使日民主勢力不能抬頭。則中日兩國之對立。且必爲時極長。此次上海事件。即或可能於國際調停之下。勉强解决而最大關鍵之東北問題。以及今後日軍對我各種各式之衝突。終無停止。換言之。中日間仍必作持久之對立。在此持久對立之情勢下。中國如欲爭取民族之生存自由。則非作持久抗爭之準備不可。</p>
<p>此次國府遷往洛陽。免受日人砲艦之威脅。假如遷都而誠爲準備抗爭。并準備作持久之抗爭。則此舉誠爲得計。我民族處於今日情勢之下。惟抗爭乃有出路。惟抱必死之决心以抗爭。乃能圖存。否則漫漫長夜。前途誠黝黑如漆。我國今後究將如何準備作持久之抗爭乎。以吾人之觀察考慮。其道有六。　　舉國上下。竭誠悔禍。精誠團結。和衷共濟道之一。節衣縮食。刻苦奮鬥。人其臥薪嘗胆之精神。且抱犧牲個人利益以求民族利益之决心。道之二。發展内地交通。利用失業羣衆及軍隊。敷設内地各處之汽車路。如西北諸幹綫及粤漢綫等。并築路與蘇聯之土西鐵道相接。使與歐洲大陸通。道之三。集中人力與財力。開發内地及各邊陲。發展小範圍之工業。道之四。救濟農業。維持農村經濟。增加農業生產。道之五。武裝民衆。使人民得有足以自衛之武力。道之六　　上述六者。爲對外持久抗爭之要道。亦即我民族之出路。時危勢迫。我民族已再不容因循苟安。國人其急興</p>

<h3>張華浜之激戰</h3>
<p>日軍分水陸兩路進犯</p>
<p>我翁旅奮勇迎頭痛擊</p>
<p>日軍司令野村、以海軍迭次向我吳淞砲台進攻、均遭失敗、同時又因吳淞口外、尚有英艦停泊未便開砲、仍變更計劃、於昨日上午、遣派陸軍三千名、由楊樹浦底軍工路、曁黃浦江旁之糧米站兩處、向我吳淞方面舉進攻、當被我駐防藴藻浜之翁旅、在裏揚旗方面、迎頭痛擊、上午第一次接觸敵即不支敗退、下午二次接觸、戰爭極猛烈、同時浦江日艦五艘、向吳淞開砲助戰、並有飛機多架擲彈、但我軍陣綫仍在原處未動茲將激戰詳情、分紀於下、</p>

<p>敵軍派飛機十餘架自上海方面空中、沿淞滬鐵路飛至江灣·高境廟·張華浜·藴藻浜·吳淞鎭·等處、先行偵察一過、隨即沿途投擲大批炸彈、最後又飛至吳淞要塞、擲彈十餘枚、均未命中、當敵機擲彈時、我軍即用商射砲射擊、故敵機在吳淞要塞擲彈後即不敢再來、</p>
<h3>敵陸軍進攻失敗</h3>
<p>敵機擲彈</p>
<p>後、日軍司令野村、即派鐵甲車二輛、裝置機關槍之機器脚踏車十餘輛、及卡車十餘部、滿載日陸軍一千餘名、於上午九時許、由楊樹浦底沿軍工路開至張華浜進攻吳淞、一面有日海軍驅逐艦二艘、載日兵千餘名、駛至高橋沙（俗名老鼠沙）光華火油棧前面浦中、用鐵殼駁船二艘、</p>
<h3>英兵在滬西佈防（李尊庸攝）</h3>
<p>渡至張華浜糧米站碼頭登陸、即會同鐵甲車進攻藴藻浜車站、十時許戰事即爆發、敵軍由敵艦開砲·及飛機在空中擲彈、掩護而進我軍現駐守吳淞兵力甚厚、即經譚司令指揮禦敵、當兩軍開戰時、記者適在吳淞張華浜海關河泊司署、其時敵軍最前線在兩路工廠之東藴藻浜車站·西揚旗·甘家橋·軍工路·糧米站一帶、甘家橋有不少草棚、已被敵兵焚毁、砲火初不甚猛、至下午一時許、復有敵艦三艘、開至助戰、而砲火漸趨劇烈、河泊司署方面、流彈飛來甚多記者以該處係在火線之内、危險異常、遂於下午二時許、離該處返滬其時雙方激戰、較前更爲劇烈敵軍死傷不少我軍仍堅守原陣地、兀不爲動、記者遠望吳淞西鎭、已有數處起火、當記者在歸途中、沿途瞥見有敵兵駕駛卡車六輛、滿裝洋松板木·及大批蔴繩、先後向東疾馳、大致係因藴藻浜大橋及鐵路橋已被我軍炸斷、故用以架搭浮橋、偷渡藴藻浜截擊我軍者、聞我軍司令部、得淞方開戰消息、業已派大隊援軍、開往夾擊、</p>
<p>又據某方消息、昨晨十時前、日軍紛調海軍前往吳淞、同時各方面傳出消息、日軍預定計畫、限於七日佔領吳淞砲臺、計調往吳淞者、陸軍方面有日兵三千名、由日本郵船會社碼頭裝載前往、並由軍工路開出鐵甲車十四輛、海軍方面、除將所有停泊浦江中之日艦悉數調往外、並由白龍港方面、開往十餘艘、空軍方面則由白龍港飛往十餘架、日軍第一次由陸路先向我軍進攻、我軍翁旅竭力抵抗結果日軍不支敗退、第二次、日軍又於中午十二時以鐵甲車六架、掩護步兵六七百名、向我吳淞方面猛衝、同時飛機在南翔亦投擲炸彈現雙方仍在激戰中、</p>
<p>又據另一報吿稱、日軍遣調新到之陸軍曁陸戰隊一部約三千餘人、分兩路運至藴藻浜附近、一路由軍工路乘軍用汽車並携鐵甲汽車十餘輛、運抵張華浜附近當於十時許、與我軍翁部步哨衝突戰至十一時半、敵不支而退、另一路則由虹口匯山碼頭、以日本郵船公司及日淸輪船公司之小火輪裝載一部份軍隊、由浦江繞至糧米站登岸、於十二時許、再以鐵甲汽車六七輛、與張華浜方面會合再度猛烈進攻、我軍以機關槍及來福槍等掃射甚利、同時再以手溜彈轟炸鐵甲汽車致日方始終未能得手、敵空軍方面以、飛機七八架、冒雨在天空猛襲其目的地在、毁我獅子林要塞砲台、投下炸彈甚多然並未命中、僅傷台兵等十數人、我方以大砲還擊、致敵機不敢降低、同時敵機以暴風雨及稀霧、感受空中氣壓之不便、更因我方砲火猛烈、乃不支而退、至下午三時許、敵方海軍已完全不得逞而退却、惟陸路方面、雖經兩次敗退、但仍在張華浜附近與我軍激戰中、</p>
<h3>軍部所得之戰况</h3>
<p>關於日軍</p>
<p>進犯吳淞之戰事、據軍部方面所得戰况如下、（一）七日晨有敵艦十餘艘由白龍港開往吳淞、並有飛機十餘架、由白龍港飛至上海、白龍港僅留敵艦四五艘、（二）七日晨敵軍第一次用鐵甲車十餘輛、由張華浜方面、向我吳淞進攻、激戰頗烈、當被我軍擊退、（三）下午十二時半、敵軍第二次復用鐵甲車六架、掩護步兵六七百名、向我吳淞猛力衝鋒正在激戰中、（四）據外人方面消息、日方確於六日晚到有陸軍數千名、並限令七日攻陷吳淞、（五）吳淞方面、敵艦因有英艦兩艘泊在我砲台方面、未敢開砲、祇有敵機數架、向獅子林砲台擲彈、我軍死傷十餘人、</p>
<h3>閘北昨日戰况</h3>
<p>敵軍三次猛攻八字橋</p>
<p>均被我擊退傷亡過半</p>
<p>日軍自變更戰略後、昨日集中海陸空軍全力、猛攻吳淞、而閘北方面、日軍逐漸抽調至吳淞、兵力已見單薄、故形勢較和緩、戰事側重於江灣路及八字橋一帶、敵先後向我軍衝襲、均經擊退、至我軍右翼虹江路寳興路北站等處昨日頗爲沉寂、</p>
<h3>八字橋我軍勝利</h3>
<p>敵軍於</p>
<p>前晚十時、向我八字橋防地進襲、激戰至一時許、經我軍奮勇應戰、將其擊退、大受重創昨日正午十二時許、敵復以飛機大砲、向八字橋我軍防地、猛烈轟擊、同時並以機關槍·小鋼砲·連續射擊、於此砲聲機關槍密射之下、敵軍即拚命向我軍衝襲我軍當亦奮起抗敵、迎頭痛擊、一部份且抄其後方、截擊敵方後路、敵始不支、向後潰退、是役戰約一時許、斃敵甚衆、至午後二時、敵軍喘息甫定、復得援軍、又以一千餘衆、向八字橋進攻、大砲猛轟、飛機仍在空中助戰、惟我軍以逸待勞、勇猛應敵、又將敵軍擊潰、敵軍兩次進攻、均遭失利、但昨日敵軍作戰者、多數係新來之正式陸軍、故終未肯罷手復於下午五時左右、三次進攻我軍、其勢尤較十二時二時兩役爲烈、時敵軍士氣已餒當進衝之時、一經我軍還擊、發槍已多慌急狀態、故終爲我軍逐回敗去、傷亡過半、我軍亦有犧牲、綜計昨日敵機向我軍陣地擲彈、有百餘次之多惟爆發甚少、且多落於空地之上無甚大損失、又狄思威路方面、昨日敵軍亦有進攻、經我軍應戰後、敵即退去、故未有激戰、</p>
<h3>燬敵坦克車二輛</h3>
<p>昨晨十時</p>
<p>許、日陸戰隊藉新到之陸軍援助、由虹口公園之北江灣之南、（沿鐵路南）突向我軍進攻、同時日兵在靶子場用野砲掩護、更用新式坦克車二輛、隨軍隊衝鋒、我軍亦用鋼砲機關槍掃射、激戰至烈、相持不久、日兵即漸不支我軍即挺進、日兵乃急用坦克車向我軍再度衝鋒、詎該坦克車二輛、竟墮入我軍戰壕内、日兵尚圖一再奪回、均爲我軍所擊退、而該車乃遭我軍用炸彈手溜彈所轟燬、日兵終未得逞、雙方尚在相持中、</p>
<h3>敵機擲彈未命中</h3>
<p>昨晨九時</p>
<p>、敵飛機十餘架、先至天通菴車站投擲炸彈數枚、旋飛至眞茹擲彈百餘、均未命中損害極微、同時在虹口花園之日軍、又用大砲頻頻向寳山路一帶轟擊示威、十時許寳山路天通菴路口、先行起火、至午後一時、香山路與永興路間之房屋、亦相繼起火、一時火光燭天、日軍目的志在破壞、軍事方面以我軍戒備嚴密、陣線毫無變動、</p>
<h3>敵人稱華軍善戰</h3>
<p>上海泰晤</p>
<p>士報云、日飛機以炸彈接續轟擊華兵陣線、華兵或無自衛之方、且地位殊難回答日兵野戰與山砲之砲火、然華兵士氣仍壯、其勇武精神、毫未搖動、此即日水兵亦承認者、昨夜（六日）日陸戰隊某軍官曾曰、華兵之抵抗力、非常强硬、猛烈之砲火、加於彼等、彼等屹然不動、當其陣線爲砲火所毁時、彼等即以持來禍槍兵士伏於闕口、準備抵抗日兵之進攻、故日兵終不能前進云、又據另一方面消息、守衛閘北陣線華兵、士氣極壯、雖屢受砲轟、陣線屢破然彼等　由闕口衝出以抵抗衝鋒之日兵、輔助機關槍、在呼肉搏、華兵經數日之苦戰後、昨夜其實力已能在日兵陣線前鋒數地點、作强力之步兵攻勢、日兵爲免犧牲過巨計、已退回淞滬鐵路東面之舊陣線、</p>
<h3>我軍開大砲禦敵</h3>
<p>大陸報云</p>
<p>昨日（六日）午夜後、因日軍砲火猛烈、華兵亦在麥根路附近、以六吋及八吋口徑之大砲還擊、猛轟兩小時、此爲開戰以來所用最大之砲、其聲震動上海全埠、聞經此猛轟之後、已將狄思威路至商務印書館一帶日兵掃除一凈、華兵且以機關槍猛轟北車站附近之日兵至今日（七日）侵晨、槍聲始止、</p>
<h3>我空軍不碍租界</h3>
<p>字林報云</p>
<p>、中國飛機二十六架到滬後、將與日飛機在天空一决雌雄、星期五日曾飛出數架、據上海吳市長昨日（六日）通吿英總領事白利南、謂軍政部决計用飛機以抗日飛機、惟諸機均不載炸彈、且將加意審愼、以防危及租界外人之安全、請英總領事轉吿滬上英僑云、已到滬之中國飛機、共二十六架、内有琴克斯式·蛾式·美式者、其駕機師皆在外國受有訓練、在美法留學者數人、餘在英德兩國留學、俟廣東張</p>
<h3>靶子塲日軍砲位内有大砲十五尊</h3>
<p>惠長所統之飛機兩隊到滬時、尚有駕機師多人、即將來滬目下在滬之飛機、乃由美國歸來之航空家黃秉衡統帶、黃君近曾環游世界、昨日字林報代表曾訪問黃君、黃君對代表曰、中國空軍人員、深知負責之重大、與國民信賴之殷切、近見十九路軍同志忠勇抗日、以保主權、深爲感動近數月來、空軍人員磨礪以待、蓋知必有一日、奉命爲國作至大之犧牲也、惟中央政府以和平爲重、曾因以種種方法解决中日爭端、而不肯輕用武力、故中國空軍不能即出援助同志、因是愛國熱忱末由自伸、蒙辱良多、今則日本除攻我土地外、且侵犯我天空主權、其野心實可不限量、吾人爲責任心所迫、不能再事</p>
<p>蟄伏、唯有與同志立於同一戰線、以抗敵寇之攻擊云、</p>
<h3>眞茹特别戒嚴擊退襲擊日飛機</h3>
<p>新聲社記者於昨日午後、乘車經極思非而路直駛眞茹、沿途見避難同胞、扶老携幼、肩挑手提、雨雪紛飛風聲鶴涙之中、踯躅於滬寗道上、共同兆豐公園進發、厥狀甚爲慘凉、又有沿鐵道向眞茹車站前進者、中途均被阻折回蓋昨日我方防守軍士、已奉上級長官命令、眞茹站一帶、業已宣佈特别戒嚴、雖軍隊中人、亦不能隨意經過、於是頗多徘徊躊躇、遲疑道旁、經我兵士盡力解釋、吿以前途危險後、咸皆决然而歸、故記者抵某處時、亦因格於命令、廢然而返、惟當據防守之兵士表示、謂今日上午十二時前有敵方飛機三架、乘朝霧初醒、雨雪未下之際、飛來眞茹站偵察、並擲炸彈十餘次、均未爆發、如是往返四五次、經我軍鳴槍擊退、十二時後、即奉命戒嚴云、言　、頻頻向記者道歉、其謙和之氣、與日軍之猙獰蠻橫、可謂適成反比例、記者將歸之時、側耳四聽、寂然無聲、情狀極爲平靜、歸途中察視、滬西日紗廠豐田喜和等處、雖屋頂之沙袋猶復堆置、惟日軍之踪跡、則已杳然未見矣、</p>

<h3>How to Engage in Protracted Resistance Against the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The Japanese army, in its desire to realize its imperialistic ambitions of foreign plunder and to contend for hegemony in the Pacific, has been scheming against us with deliberate calculation since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, as if it were but a single day. The Northeast Incident of September 18th last year and the recent Shanghai Incident are merely the concrete exposure of its ambitions and the beginning of its actions. Therefore, the antagonism between China and Japan will inevitably become increasingly acute in the future. Assuming that democratic forces in Japan cannot rise, the antagonism between China and Japan will be very protracted. The recent Shanghai Incident, even if it can be reluctantly resolved under international mediation, will not stop the most critical Northeast problem, as well as various and sundry conflicts that the Japanese army will inflict on us in the future. In other words, China and Japan must engage in prolonged antagonism. Under this situation of protracted antagonism, if China wishes to strive for national survival and freedom, it must prepare for protracted resistance.</p>
<p>The recent relocation of the National Government to Luoyang avoids the threat of Japanese gunboats. If the relocation of the capital is indeed a preparation for resistance and a preparation for protracted resistance, then this move is indeed well-considered. Under the current situation, the only way out for our nation is resistance. Only by holding a death-defying determination to resist can we survive. Otherwise, the long night will be dark as lacquer. How will our country prepare for protracted resistance in the future? Based on our observations and considerations, there are six ways: First, the entire nation, from top to bottom, sincerely repents of its mistakes, unites with sincerity, and helps each other in harmony. Second, practice frugality, live a simple life, and strive hard, embodying the spirit of Goujian who slept on brushwood and tasted gall, and embracing the determination to sacrifice individual interests for the sake of national interests. Third, develop inland transportation, utilizing unemployed masses and the military to construct motor roads in various inland areas, such as the Northwest trunk lines and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and building roads to connect with the Turkestan–Siberia Railway of the Soviet Union, so as to connect with the European continent. Fourth, concentrate manpower and financial resources to develop the interior and various border regions, and develop small-scale industries. Fifth, provide relief to agriculture, maintain the rural economy, and increase agricultural production. Sixth, arm the people, so that they have the means to defend themselves. The above six are essential paths for protracted resistance against foreign aggression, and also the way out for our nation. With the urgency of the times and the pressure of the situation, our nation can no longer afford to be negligent and complacent. People of the nation, arise quickly!</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Changes Strategy and Concentrates on Wusong</h3>
<p>A Large-Scale Attack by Land, Sea, and Air Focused on the Rear of the Fortifications. Our Troops Use All Their Strength to Defend, Preventing the Enemy from Succeeding. Zhabei Enters a State of Truce in the Evening. Zhenru is Under Special Alert Due to Enemy Aircraft Bombing. Previously, the Japanese army, with marines and reservists, attacked Zhabei, launching several general offensives, all of which were repelled by our troops, resulting in significant losses. At the same time, more than ten warships bombarded the Wusong Fort, hoping to seize the fortress, but were again defeated. Although the Japanese army has suffered significant damage over the past ten days, its intention to invade has not diminished in the slightest. Therefore, since the evening of the 6th, after more than four thousand army soldiers newly transferred from Japan arrived in Shanghai, the Japanese army commander Nomura changed his strategy and launched a large-scale attack on Wusong with all its land, sea, and air forces yesterday morning, limiting the time to capture our fortress within 24 hours, intending to first occupy the Wusong Fort, hoping to use Yangshupu along the Huangpu River to outside the Wusong estuary as a base for the Japanese army, and then take Zhabei with all their strength. Therefore, starting at 7:00 am yesterday morning, they began to implement this new strategy, first using more than ten aircraft to fly to our military positions to inspect and drop a large number of bombs, and at the same time dispatching more than two thousand army soldiers to attack Wusong from the Grain Station and Jungong Road. Six or seven warships moored in the Huangpu River east of Zhanghuabang also simultaneously opened fire on our Wusong area. At around 10:00 am, the Weng Brigade stationed in the Yunzaobang area launched a head-on attack within the Liyangqi defense line, and the enemy's first charge was repelled by us, resulting in many casualties. After 12:00 pm, they launched a second attack. Our troops resisted with all their might, and the enemy continued to attack fiercely, and the battle was extremely fierce. On the Zhabei front, the enemy also used armored vehicles and tanks to cover the infantry from Tiantongan Road to attack our Bazibridge position at the same time, but was repelled by our troops and destroyed two enemy tanks on Jiangwan Road. Since 6:00 pm, Zhabei seemed to have entered a state of truce. Also, enemy aircraft dropped bombs in our Wusong, Yunzaobang Zhabei, Zhenru and other places in the morning and afternoon, but none of them hit. Only civilian houses were bombed and burned in our military defense line. The detailed battle situation in various places yesterday is recorded in detail as follows,</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle of Zhanghuabang</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Attacks by Land and Water</p>
<p>Our Weng Brigade Bravely Fights Back Head-On</p>
<p>Japanese Army Commander Nomura launched repeated attacks on our Wusong Fort with the navy, but all failed. At the same time, because British warships were still moored outside the Wusong estuary, it was inconvenient to open fire, so he changed his plan and dispatched three thousand army soldiers from Jungong Road at the bottom of Yangshupu and the Grain Station next to the Huangpu River to attack our Wusong area yesterday morning. When they were attacked head-on by our Weng Brigade stationed in Yunzaobang, they could not support and retreated at the first contact in the morning. At the second contact in the afternoon, the war was extremely fierce. At the same time, five Japanese warships in the Pujiang opened fire on Wusong to help fight, and many aircraft dropped bombs, but our military defense line remained in place. The details of the fierce battle are recorded below,</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft First Drops Bombs</h3>
<p>Around 7:00 AM Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The enemy army dispatched more than ten aircraft from the air in Shanghai, flew along the Songhu Railway to Jiangwan, Gaojingmiao, Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, Wusongzhen, etc., first reconnoitered, and then dropped a large number of bombs along the way, and finally flew to the Wusong Fortress and dropped more than ten bombs, all of which missed. When the enemy aircraft dropped bombs, our army used commercial artillery to shoot, so the enemy aircraft dared not come again after dropping bombs at the Wusong Fortress,</p>
<h3>Enemy Army Attack Fails</h3>
<p>After Enemy Aircraft Drops Bombs</p>
<p>Japanese Army Commander Nomura then dispatched two armored vehicles, more than ten motorcycle foot pedals equipped with machine guns, and more than ten trucks loaded with more than one thousand Japanese army soldiers, and at around 9:00 am, opened from the bottom of Yangshupu along Jungong Road to Zhanghuabang to attack Wusong. On one side, there were two Japanese navy destroyers carrying more than one thousand Japanese soldiers, and sailed to Gaoqiaosha (commonly known as Laoshusha) in front of the Guanghua kerosene depot in the Pujiang, using two iron-shell barges,</p>
<h3>British Soldiers Deployed in Western Shanghai (Photo by Li Zunyong)</h3>
<p>Landed at the Zhanghuabang Grain Station wharf and joined the armored vehicles to attack Yunzaobang Station. The war broke out at around 10:00 am. The enemy army advanced under the cover of enemy warships firing cannons and aircraft dropping bombs in the air. Our army now has a strong force stationed in Wusong, and defended against the enemy under the command of Commander Tan. When the two armies started the war, the reporter happened to be at the Zhanghuabang Customs River Department Office in Wusong. At that time, the enemy's front line was in the Yunzaobang Station, Xi Yangqi, Ganjia Bridge, Jungong Road, and Grain Station east of the two roads factory. There were many thatched sheds in Ganjia Bridge, which had been burned by the enemy soldiers. The artillery fire was not very fierce at first. At around 1:00 pm, three more enemy warships came to help, and the artillery fire gradually became fierce. Many stray bullets flew to the River Department Office. The reporter believed that this place was within the line of fire and was extremely dangerous, so he left the place and returned to Shanghai at around 2:00 pm. At that time, the fierce battle between the two sides was even more intense than before. The enemy army suffered many casualties, but our army still stood firm in its original position. Looking from a distance, several places in Xizhen, Wusong, had caught fire. When the reporter was on his way back, he saw six enemy soldiers driving trucks, fully loaded with foreign pine wood and a large number of hemp ropes, speeding east one after another. Generally, it was because the Yunzaobang Bridge and the railway bridge had been blown up by our army, so they were used to build pontoon bridges to sneak across Yunzaobang to intercept our army. It is heard that our military headquarters has received news of the outbreak of war in Songfang, and has sent a large number of reinforcements to attack from both sides.</p>
<p>According to a certain source, before 10:00 am yesterday, the Japanese army transferred the navy to Wusong, and at the same time, news came from all sides that the Japanese army planned to occupy the Wusong Fort on the 7th, and a total of three thousand Japanese soldiers were transferred to Wusong by land, loaded from the Japanese Mail Steamer Company Wharf, and fourteen armored vehicles were opened from Jungong Road. In the navy, in addition to transferring all the Japanese warships moored in the Pujiang, more than ten ships were opened from Bailonggang. In the air force, more than ten aircraft flew from Bailonggang. The Japanese army first attacked our army by land, and our Weng Brigade tried its best to resist. As a result, the Japanese army was defeated. The second time, at 12:00 noon, the Japanese army used six armored vehicles to cover six or seven hundred infantry soldiers and rushed to our Wusong. At the same time, aircraft also dropped bombs in Nanxiang. The two sides are still fighting fiercely.</p>
<p>According to another report, the Japanese army dispatched a newly arrived army and a part of the marine corps of about three thousand people, and transported them to the vicinity of Yunzaobang in two ways. One way was to transport them to the vicinity of Zhanghuabang by military vehicles and more than ten armored vehicles from Jungong Road. When they collided with the sentry of our army's Weng Department at around 10:00 am, they fought until 11:30 am, and the enemy retreated. The other way was to load a part of the army with small steamships of the Japanese Mail Steamer Company and the Japanese Qing Steamer Company from the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou, and detour to the Grain Station by the Pujiang to land. At around 12:00 noon, they joined the Zhanghuabang side with six or seven armored vehicles and launched a fierce attack again. Our army swept with machine guns and rifles, etc., and at the same time bombed the armored vehicles with hand grenades, so that the Japanese side was unable to succeed. On the enemy's air force side, seven or eight aircraft braved the rain and attacked fiercely in the sky. Their destination was to destroy our Lion Grove Fortress Fort, and they dropped many bombs, but none of them hit, only injuring a dozen or so soldiers on the platform. Our side fought back with cannons, so that the enemy aircraft did not dare to lower, and at the same time, the enemy aircraft was inconvenienced by the air pressure due to the storm and thin fog, and because our artillery fire was fierce, it was defeated and retreated. At around 3:00 pm, the enemy navy had completely failed and retreated. However, on the land side, although they had been defeated twice, they were still fighting fiercely with our army in the vicinity of Zhanghuabang.</p>
<h3>The Battle Situation Obtained by the Military Headquarters</h3>
<p>Regarding the Japanese Army</p>
<p>The war of aggression against Wusong, according to the war situation obtained by the military headquarters is as follows, (1) On the morning of the 7th, more than ten enemy warships opened from Bailonggang to Wusong, and more than ten aircraft flew from Bailonggang to Shanghai, leaving only four or five enemy warships in Bailonggang, (2) On the morning of the 7th, the enemy army first used more than ten armored vehicles to attack our Wusong from Zhanghuabang, and the fierce battle was repelled by our army, (3) At 12:30 pm, the enemy army used six armored vehicles to cover six or seven hundred infantry soldiers to violently charge our Wusong, and was fighting fiercely, (4) According to foreign sources, the Japanese side did arrive with several thousand army soldiers on the evening of the 6th, and ordered the capture of Wusong on the 7th, (5) On the Wusong side, the enemy warships did not dare to open fire because there were two British warships parked in our fortress area, and only a few enemy aircraft dropped bombs at the Lion Grove Fortress, and more than ten of our soldiers were killed or injured,</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Zhabei Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Enemy Army Launched Three Fierce Attacks on Bazibridge</p>
<p>All Were Repelled by Us, with More Than Half of the Casualties</p>
<p>After the Japanese army changed its strategy, yesterday it concentrated its sea, land, and air forces to attack Wusong, while in Zhabei, the Japanese army gradually transferred to Wusong, and the force was thin, so the situation was more relaxed, and the battle focused on the Jiangwan Road and Bazibridge area. The enemy successively attacked our army, but all were repelled. To the right wing of our army, Hongjiang Road Baoxing Road North Station and other places were quite quiet yesterday,</p>
<h3>Our Army Wins Victory at Bazibridge</h3>
<p>The Enemy Army</p>
<p>At 10:00 pm the night before, attacked our Bazibridge defense area, and fought fiercely until 1:00 am. After our army bravely resisted, they were repelled, and suffered heavy losses. At 12:00 noon yesterday, the enemy again used aircraft and artillery to fiercely bombard our Bazibridge defense area, and at the same time, used machine guns and small steel cannons to continuously shoot. Under this artillery fire and machine gun fire, the enemy army desperately rushed to attack our army. Our army also rose up to resist the enemy, and attacked head-on, and a part also copied its rear, intercepting the enemy's retreat. The enemy began to retreat, and the battle lasted for about an hour, and killed many enemies. At 2:00 pm, the enemy army had just rested and recovered reinforcements, and again attacked Bazibridge with more than a thousand people. The artillery bombarded fiercely, and the aircraft was still fighting in the air. However, our army waited for work at leisure, bravely resisted the enemy, and again defeated the enemy army. The enemy army's two attacks were unsuccessful, but yesterday the enemy army who fought were mostly newly arrived official army soldiers, so they never gave up and attacked our army for the third time at around 5:00 pm. Its momentum was even fiercer than the two battles at 12:00 and 2:00. At that time, the morale of the enemy army had been weakened. When charging, once our army counterattacked, the guns were already fired in a state of panic, so they were finally driven back and defeated by our army, with more than half of the casualties. Our army also had sacrifices. In summary, the enemy aircraft dropped bombs on our army's positions more than a hundred times yesterday, but few exploded, and most of them fell on empty ground, without much loss. Also, on the Dixiewei Road, the enemy army also attacked yesterday. After our army responded, the enemy retreated, so there was no fierce battle,</p>
<h3>Destroyed Two Enemy Tanks</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM Yesterday</p>
<p>Xu, the Japanese marine corps, with the assistance of the newly arrived army, suddenly attacked our army from the north of Hongkou Park and the south of Jiangwan (south along the railway), and at the same time, the Japanese soldiers used field artillery to cover in the target field, and even used two new-style tanks to charge with the army. Our army also used steel cannons and machine guns to sweep, and the fierce battle was fierce. After a stalemate for a while, the Japanese soldiers gradually could not support. Our army immediately advanced, and the Japanese soldiers hurriedly used the tanks to charge our army again. Unexpectedly, the two tanks fell into our army's trenches. The Japanese soldiers still tried to recapture them, but they were all repelled by our army, and the car was bombed by our army with bombs and hand grenades. The Japanese soldiers finally failed to succeed, and the two sides were still in a stalemate,</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Dropped Bombs and Missed</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM Yesterday</p>
<p>, More than ten enemy aircraft first went to Tiantongan Station and dropped several bombs, and then flew to Zhenru and dropped more than a hundred, all of which missed and caused very little damage. At the same time, the Japanese army in the Hongkou Garden used artillery to frequently bombard the Baoshan Road area to show off. At 10:00 AM, the intersection of Baoshan Road and Tiantongan Road first caught fire. At 1:00 PM, the houses between Xiangshan Road and Yongxing Road also caught fire one after another. For a time, the fire was bright. The purpose of the Japanese army was to destroy. In terms of military affairs, our army was heavily guarded, and the line of defense did not change at all.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Calls the Chinese Army Good at Fighting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times Said</p>
<p>The Japanese aircraft continuously bombed the Chinese soldiers' line of defense with bombs. The Chinese soldiers may have no way to defend themselves, and it is difficult to respond to the Japanese soldiers' field battles and mountain cannons' artillery fire. However, the morale of the Chinese soldiers is still strong, and their brave spirit has not wavered at all. This is also admitted by the Japanese sailors. Last night (6th), a certain officer of the Japanese marine corps said that the resistance of the Chinese soldiers is very strong. When fierce artillery fire is applied to them, they stand still. When their line of defense is destroyed by artillery fire, they will lie in ambush at the breach with soldiers carrying spears to prepare to resist the Japanese soldiers' attack, so the Japanese soldiers cannot advance. According to another source, the Chinese soldiers guarding the Zhabei line of defense are in high spirits. Although they have been bombarded repeatedly and the line of defense has been broken repeatedly, they rush out of the breach to resist the charging Japanese soldiers, and assist machine guns. In the meat battle, after several days of hard fighting, the Chinese soldiers were able to make a strong infantry offensive at several points on the front of the Japanese soldiers' line last night. In order to avoid excessive sacrifices, the Japanese soldiers have retreated to the old line of defense east of the Songhu Railway,</p>
<h3>Our Army Opens Artillery to Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Continental News Said</p>
<p>Yesterday (6th) after midnight, because the Japanese army's artillery fire was fierce, the Chinese soldiers also used six-inch and eight-inch cannons to counterattack near Maigen Road, and bombarded fiercely for two hours. This was the largest cannon used since the start of the war, and its sound shook the entire city of Shanghai. It is heard that after this fierce bombardment, the Japanese soldiers in the area from Dixiewei Road to the Commercial Press were wiped out. The Chinese soldiers also used machine guns to bombard the Japanese soldiers near the North Railway Station. The sound of gunfire stopped this morning (7th),</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Does Not Hinder the Concessions</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News Said</p>
<p>, After twenty-six Chinese aircraft arrived in Shanghai, they will compete with the Japanese aircraft in the sky. Several aircraft flew out on Friday. According to Shanghai Mayor Wu's notification to British Consul General Belignan yesterday (6th), the Ministry of Military Affairs decided to use aircraft to fight against Japanese aircraft, but all aircraft are not loaded with bombs, and will be more careful to prevent endangering the safety of foreigners in the concessions. Please inform the British expatriates in Shanghai. A total of twenty-six Chinese aircraft have arrived in Shanghai, including Cinks, Moth, and American types. The pilots have all received training abroad. Several people have studied in the United States and France, and the rest have studied in the United Kingdom and Germany. When the two teams of aircraft led by Zhang</p>
<h3>There are Fifteen Cannons in the Japanese Artillery Position in the Target Field</h3>
<p>When Hui-chang arrives in Shanghai, there are still many pilots who will come to Shanghai. The aircraft currently in Shanghai are led by Huang Bingheng, an aviation expert who returned from the United States. Mr. Huang recently traveled around the world. Yesterday, a representative of the North China Daily News interviewed Mr. Huang. Mr. Huang said to the representative that the Chinese air force personnel are deeply aware of the importance of their responsibilities and the earnest trust of the people. Recently, they have seen the loyal and brave resistance of the comrades of the 19th Route Army to protect sovereignty, and they are deeply moved. In recent months, the air force personnel have been sharpening their swords to wait, and they know that there will be a day when they will be ordered to make the greatest sacrifice for the country. However, the central government values peace and has been trying to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute by various methods, and is unwilling to use force lightly. Therefore, the Chinese Air Force cannot immediately come to the aid of its comrades, and therefore its patriotic enthusiasm has not been able to express itself, and it has suffered a lot of humiliation. Now, in addition to attacking our land, Japan is also infringing on our aerial sovereignty, and its ambitions are truly unlimited. We are forced by a sense of responsibility and can no longer</p>
<p>Hibernate, only to stand on the same front with comrades to resist the attack of the enemy.</p>
<h3>Zhenru is Under Special Martial Law and Repulses Attacking Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from the New Sound Agency took a car straight to Zhenru via Jisi Fei'er Road. Along the way, he saw fellow refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, carrying burdens on their shoulders, trudging on the Hu Ning Road in the wind, snow, and a desolate atmosphere, heading for the Common Zhao Feng Park. The situation was very miserable. There were also those who advanced along the railway to Zhenru Station, but they were all blocked and returned. It turned out that our defending soldiers had been ordered by their superiors that the Zhenru Station area had already been declared under special martial law, and even those in the army could not pass through at will. Therefore, many hesitated and lingered on the roadside. After our soldiers tried their best to explain and inform them of the dangers ahead, they all resolutely returned. Therefore, when the reporter arrived at a certain place, he also had to return in disappointment due to the order. However, according to the defending soldiers, three enemy aircraft had flown to Zhenru Station to reconnoiter before 12:00 am this morning, taking advantage of the early morning mist and before the rain and snow fell, and dropped more than a dozen bombs, none of which exploded. They went back and forth four or five times, and were repulsed by our army firing guns. After 12:00 am, they were ordered to be under martial law. The soldier apologized to the reporter frequently, and his modest attitude was the opposite of the ferocious barbarism of the Japanese army. When the reporter was about to return, he listened attentively, and there was silence. The situation was very peaceful. On the way back, he inspected the Nisshin cotton mill, Toyoda Kiwa, and other places in Western Shanghai. Although the sandbags on the roof were still piled up, the traces of the Japanese army had disappeared.</p>
<h3>The National Government Sends a Telegram to Encourage All Soldiers</h3>
<p>To Protect the Personality of the Country</p>
<p>To Fight for the Survival of the Nation</p>
<p>Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, and all members of the Military Commission, sent a telegram to all soldiers of the country yesterday, encouraging them to have a spirit of great fearlessness and to fight for a long time. The telegram is recorded as follows: Extremely urgent, to all commanders of provinces and all army division and brigade commanders, and forwarded to all soldiers for public review. Since the establishment of the National Revolutionary Army, our armed comrades have devoted their loyalty and bravery to complete the unification of the Republic of China. Unfortunately, domestic construction has not yet been completed, and foreign aggression has gradually arrived. Now the survival of the country is in imminent danger. Apart from succumbing to the violence of strong neighbors and losing our sovereignty and dignity, there is only one way out: to actively resist. Looking forward to all our armed comrades, remembering the difficult creation of the martyrs, and lamenting the suffering of the people, with a spirit of great fearlessness, fighting for a long time, to overcome violence and extend justice, to protect the people of the country, and to fight for the survival of the nation, this is the one and only thing to do. For several years, the disputes caused by differences in opinion among our armed comrades have been completely eliminated by the idea of sincerely going to the national crisis together. From now on, the living will work together in the battlefield, and the dead will surely laugh in the underworld, to see the final success of our country. Sincerely express my heart, and encourage each other. Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, Chiang Kai-shek, Feng Yuxiang, Zhang Xueliang, Yan Xishan, Li Zongren, Li Jishen, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Mingshu, Tang Shengzhi, Dong Yin, members of the Military Commission,</p>

<h3>Rescuing a Large Number of Chinese</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Arbitrarily Arrest and Imprison</p>
<p>Negotiations by Consular Body Lead to Release</p>
<p>Still a Large Number Awaiting Rescue</p>
<p>Japanese bandits have abducted many Chinese, mostly imprisoning them in warehouses at the Huangpu Wharf. Upon learning this, the police dispatched Western officers to rescue them yesterday. However, the Japanese soldiers initially refused to release them. After several negotiations by the Western officers, a portion, approximately 103 people, were released. They were then transported by police vehicles to the reserve team headquarters of the Yangshupu Liverpool Road Police Station for temporary shelter, so their families could claim them. However, those who were rescued were all covered in injuries, near death. According to the victims, they had been imprisoned for four or five days, receiving only three pieces of biscuits. Every day, they were beaten with iron rods by Japanese soldiers. One person, unable to endure the brutality, took advantage of an opportunity to jump into the Huangpu River, attempting suicide. Unexpectedly, a Japanese soldier saw this, retrieved him, and said that since he wanted to drown himself, he would be placed in a vat and submerged in water. He has been in this state for two days, and his life is in great danger.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that the Shanghai Consular Body has appointed a committee of three members, led by the Norwegian Consul-General, Mr. Aall. Their task is to cooperate with the Japanese authorities to supervise the handover of the Chinese detained by the Japanese Navy to the members of the Shanghai Municipal Council. They will not exercise judicial powers, and their role is purely charitable in nature. Last night, 117 Chinese arrested in areas such as Hongkou were handed over to the Public Concession police for release. After receiving them, the police immediately provided food and cigarettes. The conditions of these people were extremely miserable. According to police inspectors, the first words of most upon seeing the police were to ask, "Have you come to shoot us? If so, please just kill us quickly to spare us further torture." Many had not eaten for three days, were terrified and weak, and some were unable to eat even the thin porridge brought from the Western jail. They usually lay on the ground, and at the sound of the door opening, they would suddenly jump up in extreme fright. After receiving them, the police immediately sent doctors to examine them. One person was in critical condition and was immediately sent to the Tongren Hospital for surgery. Three others had bullet and knife wounds, which were treated separately. According to the police report last night, eleven or twelve people were temporarily kept at the police station because they had suffered severe stab wounds and needed medical treatment this morning. Most of the stab wounds were on their sides or buttocks. One child, only three years old, was also injured. He cried in terror when the doctor applied iodoform. A waiter from the Cathay Hotel was also among those released. He had been arrested by the Japanese army eight days ago, still wearing his hotel uniform. The Japanese soldiers had bound his hands and feet for six days, leaving rope marks on his wrists. Another Chinese, an accountant at a foreign firm, was arrested on Kunshan Road six days ago because he had a complete uniform of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps at home. Both men were overjoyed to be freed. According to the detainees, most of them were initially detained in the Japanese Club, and then transferred to two Japanese schools. Three days ago, they were moved at night to a lighter, packed tightly in the hold, starving and suffocating. The police released them from the Huangpu Wharf last night.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that of the so-called Chinese plainclothes soldiers detained by Japanese troops in and around the concessions, 79 were handed over to the Public Concession police yesterday. The Municipal Council has appointed a commission of inquiry consisting of the Norwegian Consul-General Mr. Aall, the Municipal Council lawyer Mr. Bolam, the Italian Mr. Ross and the English Police Court Deputy Judge Mr. Jones. The committee will question these released Chinese. The Municipal Council appointed the committee in response to requests from various parties to negotiate with the Japanese authorities for the return of the detained Chinese, to prevent them from being executed. The committee is scheduled to question the individuals today, and after ascertaining their names, occupations, and the circumstances of their suspicion, they will be made public to allow their families to identify them. The individuals will also be photographed for future reference.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Landing in the Concession</h3>
<p>Letter Requesting Measures to Prevent This</p>
<p>A letter from the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to the Shanghai Municipal Council, yesterday, stated: "To the Shanghai Municipal Council, We, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Concession, have received a letter from the 17th District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association, stating that Japan is using the Public Concession as a military base, designating the area north of the Suzhou Creek as a Japanese military operation zone. They are trampling on commerce, burning homes, and slaughtering Chinese people, engaging in extreme cruelty unparalleled in the civilized world, even surpassing the Communists in their barbarity. Our association's members, located in the North Sichuan Road area, bear the brunt of the impact, suffering tremendous losses. As the Municipal Council is responsible for local security, they cannot evade responsibility for failing to prevent these events. While the lack of strength to resist might have been understandable earlier, now that the United Kingdom and the United States have significant troops arriving in Shanghai, the Concession has adequate preparation and should seek relief measures and implement neutrality to maintain our position as East Asia's premier commercial center. Prolonging this situation will result in significant losses for Chinese merchants and economic panic for all nations. To address the root cause, the Municipal Council should prevent the unchecked arrival of Japanese warships and troop landings, such as the recent unhindered landings at the Wayside Wharf. This would interrupt their reinforcements, prevent military expansion, and maintain the Concession's original status. Otherwise, the continuous arrival of Japanese troops will prolong the conflict, and if the Concession becomes endangered, the Municipal Council must bear full responsibility. We request that you urgently forward a letter to the Municipal Council, urging strict precautions, immediate implementation of neutrality, and restoration of commerce. In response to this, we acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 5977 dated February 5th and have also read your letter to the Mayor of Shanghai, which shows that you are becoming aware of the Japanese troops' brutality. However, in recent days, large numbers of Japanese troops have continued to land at the Wayside Wharf, indicating their intent to expand the war and the scope of their aggression. They completely disregard the protests from your position and the consuls and governments of your affiliated countries. We believe that if the Japanese military's lawless behavior is not stopped immediately, the prosperity of Shanghai, painstakingly developed by Chinese and foreigners over 88 years, will be directly and indirectly destroyed by the Japanese military. Commerce between Europe and America, and China, will reach a point of no return. Therefore, we request that your bureau and affiliated countries take a broader view, promptly adopt effective measures to curb Japan's destruction of peace in East Asia, and maintain the world economy. Safeguarding the small area south of the Suzhou Creek is essential for protecting the commerce between the countries concerned and China. We hope you will investigate and take appropriate action."</p>
<h3>Letter from the First District Citizens' United Association to the Ratepayers' Association</h3>
<p>The First</p>
<p>The First District Citizens' United Association sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Association, Regarding the recent Shanghai incident involving negotiations between China and Japan, while officials have already made concessions and acceded to their demands, the violent Japanese openly initiated hostilities. The Concession authorities, despite claiming the Concession to be a neutral zone, have actually handed over the Hongkou area to the Japanese, which is detrimental to our own people and the military both inside and outside the Concession. We urge your Association to vigorously negotiate with the Concession authorities. Regarding the response to the serious situation in the city, such as the flow of finance, provision of military supplies, maintenance of security, and the accommodation of refugees, we should unite various legal bodies to temporarily organize a unified organization to quickly develop comprehensive and systematic measures. We have sent letters to the Citizens' General Association in addition to this, and we have always respected your Association as the leading organization of Chinese citizens. We implore you to sound the call and work together to devise effective strategies. The situation is urgent, and we are full of anticipation.</p>

<h3>Various Japanese Military News</h3>
<p>The Japanese Have Not Yet Awakened to the Situation: Japanese Troops Suffer Repeated Defeats, Causing Abnormal Panic in Tokyo. Having Seen Japanese Newspapers, and Now According to the Mainichi Shimbun, government officials, with the exception of a small number of hardline military figures, have largely softened. Yesterday, Nobuchika Okuma, Toshiatsu Sakamoto, and Kenichi Oshima, among others, remained unrepentant and egged on the government to advocate a tough stance towards China. At 1 PM on the 6th, they visited Tsuyoshi Inukai, urging him to declare his guiding principles for dealing with China. (Note: Nobuchika Okuma is the adopted son of the former Marquis Okuma and has long been a proponent of invading China.)</p>
<p>Commander Nomura Arrives in Shanghai. The Mainichi Shimbun carried a report from the Denstu News Agency, dated the 5th from Sasebo, stating that the newly appointed Commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, Vice-Admiral Nomura, departed Sasebo at 6 PM on the 5th and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>Change of Japanese Commander. The Daily News reports that the commander of the Japanese Marines, Samejima, has been ordered to return home and will be succeeded by Rear Admiral Tsunemasa Uemura. After consulting with Third Fleet Commander Nomura in Sasebo, Uemura arrived in Shanghai at 3 PM on the 6th aboard the Tatsuta cruiser. He went to the Marine Corps headquarters on Jiangwan Road, received a report from the outgoing Commander Samejima, and then drove to the front lines to inspect the battle situation. He also made the following statement: "The current situation is deteriorating. I have been ordered to succeed as commander, which is the duty of a soldier. However, I am also very aware of the nature of the Shanghai Concession. England, the United States, and other countries have different opinions. I was appointed as the commander of the Japanese Marines during the Shanghai disturbances in 1927. At that time, the armies of England, the United States, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal, which were concentrated in Shanghai, were very understanding. General Duncan of England, General Butler of the United States, and other commanders coordinated to jointly carry out defensive duties." (Translator's note: The situation at that time was related to internal warfare and is distinctly different from the current response to the warlike behavior of the violent Japanese.)</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Arrive in Shanghai. The Shanghai Times reports that yesterday (the 6th), 1,500 Japanese soldiers arrived in Shanghai from Japan and landed in Yangshupu.

<p>The North-China Daily News reports that, according to semi-official sources, a Japanese army mixed brigade and naval marines are expected to arrive in Shanghai today (the 7th) to reinforce the Japanese troops in Shanghai. However, it is unknown whether they will disembark at the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) wharf and reside in the Japanese military camp or disembark near the battlefield. The reporter inquired about the arrival of Japanese troops with the Japanese headquarters, but the Japanese were tight-lipped. The new Japanese Marine Corps commander in Shanghai, Rear Admiral Tsunemasa Uemura, arrived in Shanghai from Japan yesterday afternoon (the 6th). Many senior Japanese military officers and consulate officials went to the wharf to greet him. Rear Admiral Uemura had previously served as the commander of the Japanese Marines in Shanghai. The new commander of the Third Fleet, Vice-Admiral Nomura, will arrive in Shanghai today (the 7th).</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Active Yesterday. After the Japanese pirates invaded Zhabei, Japanese warships were unusually busy. Yesterday morning, a Japanese gunboat, four ships from the 30th Torpedo Squadron, two ships from the 22nd Torpedo Squadron, and one ship from the 2nd Torpedo Squadron, a total of eight ships, anchored in the Yangshupu river before heading to the Wusong area. Around 2 PM in the afternoon, one of the ships from the 2nd Torpedo Squadron returned to Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Location of Japanese Aircraft Landing. The Shanghai Times reports that the Japanese army and navy authorities are now arranging an aircraft parking area on vacant land in the Yangshupu district, a few yards from the corner of Pingliang Road and Liping Road. Yesterday afternoon (the 6th), a large team of Japanese soldiers and two Russians were busy filling in the land. There are already four Japanese aircraft stationed there. In the afternoon, they flew out for reconnaissance.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the sports field of Shanghai University is currently being converted into a Japanese aircraft landing site by Japanese soldiers. In addition, vacant land about half a mile from the Texas Oil Company's oil depot was also being leveled by the Japanese yesterday, under the protection of the Marines.

Most of them will return to Japan from Shanghai. According to estimates by the Japanese consul, a total of about 4,000 Japanese nationals have returned to Japan from Hongkou in recent days. About 500 people have left Shanghai, mostly women and children, with only about 200 men.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Carry Corpses Back Home. Several hundred members of a special Japanese Marine Corps were sent to Shanghai to provide assistance a few days ago. Unexpectedly, they were completely annihilated by our army (reportedly, only five people survived). On the morning of the 6th, the Japanese warship Mamiya left port, fully loaded with corpses, and returned to Sasebo.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Soldiers Are Inhuman</h3>
<p>I Hope My Compatriots Take Note</p>
<p>Citizens of this port are often driven by curiosity and enjoy watching the excitement. This is usually harmless, but in these times of terror, it is necessary to be careful everywhere and at all times. Since the January 28th Incident, whenever Japanese soldiers pass by, they open windows to look and whisper to each other, arousing the suspicion of the enemy soldiers. It is common for them to open fire or break into homes, arresting and harming everyone inside. Countless of our compatriots have been injured or killed as a result. All of this is a meaningless sacrifice, harming oneself without benefiting the country. I hope that all of our compatriots will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Respond to the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>Telegram from All Circles in Chongqing. A telegram from all circles in Chongqing states: "In this time of national crisis, Mayor Wu of Shanghai, Generals Zhang, Chen, Cai, Jiang, and Deng, officers, soldiers, volunteers, comrades, and the Shanghai newspapers and all compatriots are notified: The Japanese bandits are tyrannical, initiating hostilities in Shanghai, bombing and burning our Zhabei and Hongkou, and massacring our innocent compatriots. They disregard international law, are willing to destroy world peace, break oaths, and brazenly disregard all propriety. Fortunately, our officers, soldiers, and comrades are loyal, brave, and patriotic, risking their lives to fight the enemy and uphold justice, finally eliminating these ugly villains. The violent Japanese, who have dominated East Asia and have been eyeing the Far East, have suffered a major defeat unprecedented since the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, washing away the shame of our century of weakness and incompetence. News of the victory has spread to Sichuan, causing joy. We are outraged by the Japanese bandits' inhumanity and their cruel and ferocious actions, and we mourn the innocent suffering of our compatriots. In this critical national situation, the people of this district pledge to sweep away the evil influence and follow the same path. In addition to reporting the organization of volunteer troops and conducting fundraising for consolation money and providing assistance, we request that you first send a telegram of condolence and ask for victory.

Li Liejun and others from the Jiangxi Public Association telegraphed: "Commander-in-Chief Chiang, General Cai, Commander Dai, Having received word, since the national crisis of September 18th, the Japanese bandits' greed has been insatiable, and their aggression against the Eastern Provinces has not ceased, but has advanced to sweep the entire country. In recent days, they have rampaged along the coast of Shanghai. Fortunately, our army has valiantly resisted, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's advance, establishing a reputation for the country, and breaking unprecedented records, enabling China, which has been weak for so long, to rise to a position of unparalleled glory. The previous shame has been wiped clean, and the dignity of the nation has been restored. Upon hearing the news of victory, we cannot help but shout 'Long live the Republic of China!' and feel deep admiration for the meritorious deeds of the Chinese people, descendants of gods.

<p>Telegram from the Anti-Japanese Association of Xikuangshan, Hunan. The People's Patriotic Anti-Japanese Association of Xikuangshan, Hunan telegraphed: (Titles omitted) "Since the Japanese bandits have wreaked havoc, the Northeast has been lost, and they have dispatched fleets to bomb Shanghai. The disaster is imminent, and the disease is spreading to the heartland. If we continue to do nothing, the country will be destroyed and the family will be lost. Fortunately, you and others have bravely resisted and inflicted a major blow on the enemy. After hearing the news, we are overjoyed.

<p>The Whampoa Comrades Organize a National Salvation Corps. More than eighty Whampoa Military Academy alumni residing in Shanghai held a meeting at the Yipinxian Grand Hotel yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to exchange views on how to respond to the violent acts of aggression by Japanese imperialism. He Jingmin chaired the meeting, and Zhong Jianzhi recorded the proceedings. The chairman first reported on the meaning and purpose of convening the meeting, stating that, "In this time of national survival, we comrades, who have all received the teachings of the Premier and military training, must participate in the anti-Japanese work at the front lines for the sake of the entire nation and the survival of the country." After each person expressed their views, it was decided to organize the Whampoa Comrades' National Salvation Corps, which would include a vanguard team, a propaganda team, a rescue team, and a general affairs department. As a result, He Jingmin, Zhong Jianzhi, Lou Yecang, Zhu Guanghua, Chen Guangya, Zhu Lin, and Sheng Qunhe were elected as members of the preparatory committee. The office address was temporarily set at No. 2-2, Xishenxiang Pavilion, Houjiabang, Xinbeimen, in the city. They are actively preparing, and once the organization is ready, they will rush to the front lines to participate in the fighting with the 19th Route Army.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Iron-Blooded National Salvation Army. The Iron-Blooded National Salvation Army telegraphed: "All Comrades and Compatriots Across the Country Are Notified. We believe that the violent Japanese are acting outrageously, regarding us as no one. They have not only occupied the Northeast, but also endangered Shanghai. Since April, almost the entire country has suffered their devastation. The League of Nations speaks emptily of peace, and mediation by the great powers is ineffective. Our 400 million compatriots, with hearts not yet dead, how can we bear to sit idly by? If it were not for the brave and capable officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, who were determined to die for justice, Shanghai would have fallen and suffered the same fate as the Northeast. We, Lin et al., are all soldiers of low rank, survivors of years of battlefield combat, and we are heartbroken by the national crisis and filled with righteous indignation. Remembering the words that every citizen has a responsibility and fulfilling the wish to be buried in a horse hide, we have assembled our troops, drawn our swords, and advanced to aid the 19th Route Army's loyal and brave officers and soldiers, spilling blood to eliminate the Japanese, pledging to live or die together, and fighting for national glory, hoping to preserve our race and survive. We resolve to die rather than be humiliated by future generations. This is our sincere wish. Commanders Zhu Lin, Chief of Staff Wang Xingyong, Head of the Adjutant Office Wu Jiansheng, Commander Xie Yongzai, Wen Biao, Captains of the Special Operations Brigade Xu Deyuan, Liu Changsheng, Cheng Haizhou, Yan Xichen, and Mao Tingming, and all officers and soldiers, respectfully submit this."</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Progressive Association's Work. Since the 19th Route Army has been resisting the Japanese in Shanghai, all of the people of Shanghai have been actively providing assistance. The association believes that the anti-Japanese war is a long-term undertaking, and all the people of the country must rise up together. The area along the Beijing-Shanghai line is the rear of the 19th Route Army, and it is especially important. Therefore, a rear service team has been established, with Cao Chu appointed as the team leader. He led nine team members to depart on the 6th, walk to Nanxiang, and then take a car to work in the areas of Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang. The association also has more than twenty female members, including Wen Jimu, who have formed a front-line rescue team. Eight of them will depart today and be assigned to various locations by the Chinese Red Cross on Erma Road to provide nursing care. Furthermore, the association, recognizing that the 19th Route Army is fighting for national dignity and national survival, has compiled and published a book entitled "The Truth about the 19th Route Army's Bloody Anti-Japanese Battle," which was released yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ruffians Continue to Harass</h3>
<p>Murders and Arson Occur One After Another</p>
<p>Plainclothes Troops Plot Major Activities</p>
<p>Japanese Ruffians Commit Arson. At 11 PM the night before last, over twenty armed Japanese ruffians arrived near Qian Guo Village in the eastern suburbs of Qimei Road, carrying four large boxes of kerosene and a large package of sulfur igniters, and set fires everywhere. In an instant, the red flames shot up into the sky. Villagers woke up from their dreams and fled from the fire, sounding the alarm. Nearby Chinese troops arrived upon hearing the alarm, and the Japanese ruffians fled. After the soldiers and civilians tried their best to put out the fire, seventeen houses were burned down, and two young children and one old woman were killed.</p>
<p>Plainclothes Troops Active. Yesterday, residents in the western area of Shanghai said that around noon, dozens of Japanese plainclothes soldiers were riding in eight cars and drove from Avenue Edward VII to western Shanghai, seemingly intending to cross the Great West Road and enter the Zhabei Zhongxing Road to disrupt the rear of our army. It is unconfirmed whether this actually occurred.</p>
<p>Overturning of a Refugee Boat. Yesterday morning at 11 AM, a refugee boat sailing from Wusong was rammed head-on by a Japanese warship patrol boat while passing through the Yangshupu River. More than thirty people on board fell into the water. Nearby small sampans managed to rescue more than twenty people, but the rest are missing. The Japanese patrol boat that caused the accident simply turned around and left.</p>
<p>Injured Men and Women. The day before yesterday afternoon, a bomb was dropped by the Japanese army at No. 397 Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei, injuring the young woman Fang Homin (30 years old), who suffered facial injuries, and the girl Xie Chengqing (12 years old), who suffered hand injuries. The seven-year-old boy Fang Xiaoxiang suffered head injuries. Huang Ajin, who lives at No. 176 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, was stabbed in the abdomen and thigh by Japanese soldiers. Wang Songlin, who lives at No. 14 Hongxingfang, Baoshan Road, was stabbed in the shoulder by Japanese soldiers. Chen Guiyu, a waiter at the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund, was stabbed twice in the head, twice in the feet, and once in the right hand by Japanese soldiers. All of the above were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Appeals for Help from Various Sectors</h3>
<p>Telegraph Urges the Fourth Group Army to Assist Shanghai: Li Zongren's Fourth Division Liaison Office in Shanghai, yesterday telegraphed Division Commander Yuan Yuanyun, stating: "The nation is in crisis. To the Fourth Group Army Independent Fourth Division Headquarters in Nanjing, Commander Yuan Yuanjian, The brutal Japanese are resorting to desperate measures, and are aggressively attacking Shanghai. For days, heavy artillery has bombarded Zhabei, turning city streets into ruins. Iron hooves trample, with cruelty and viciousness that makes one's hair stand on end. Our 19th Route Army is fulfilling its duty to defend the nation and protect its territory, bravely resisting the enemy, fighting bloody battles for eight days and nights, achieving successive victories, greatly thwarting the stubborn enemy, and inflicting heavy casualties. It is reported that the Japanese cabinet has decided to send another division to assist Shanghai, throwing in their fierce troops and intensifying their aggression. Therefore, the battle of Shanghai is a crucial battle for the survival of our nation. We urgently request that you lead your troops to rush to our aid, eliminating the short, ugly invaders. We also hope that you will come to Shanghai to devise strategies and lead the war effort. The telegram is urgent, awaiting your orders. Sincerely, Xu Jinggong, Director of the Shanghai Liaison Office."</p>
<p>Hunanese Telegram Appeals to He Jian to Aid Shanghai: Xiong Xiling and other Hunanese residing in Shanghai sent a telegram to He Jian, stating: "Chairman He of Changsha, members of various committees, commanders of various armies, divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions, legal entities, the Hunan National Crisis Relief Association, and newspaper offices, The Japanese took advantage of the beating of a Japanese monk incident a month ago to propose the cancellation of the patriotic movement in Shanghai. The authorities tolerated and accepted this, and the Japanese Consul expressed satisfaction. Suddenly, on the night of the 28th, they launched a military invasion. Our 19th Route Army is striving for self-defense, and after a week of fighting, the enemy's advance has been repeatedly thwarted. We are concerned that although the enemy may be defeated temporarily, it may be difficult to sustain the resistance in the long run. We read in the newspaper with joy that you have assembled troops to provide assistance and are awaiting orders to depart. Your righteousness is evident, and your reputation precedes you. However, military action requires speed, and matters should not be delayed. With the determination to defend the country and seek survival, take practical actions to rush to the front. The telegram is eagerly awaiting your response. Sincerely, Xiong Xiling, Zhou Zhenlin, Liu Kuiyi, Zhao Hengti, Peng Yunyi, Zhang Shizhao, Cheng Zikai, Chen Qiang, Tang Mang, Huang Yiou, Chen Caidu, Yuan Huaxuan, Ren Fuli, Liu Renrui."</p>
<p>Jiangxi Residents Request Xiong Shihui to Aid Shanghai: Addressed to the Jiangxi Provincial Government and Public Organizations, The Japanese invaders are disturbing Shanghai, and our 19th Route Army is resisting with all its might, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's advance. Public morale is high, and the great powers are paying attention. This action is not only related to the situation in Shanghai, but also to the survival of the entire nation. We urge the provincial government and public organizations to provide substantial assistance quickly so that we can achieve ultimate victory. We eagerly await your response. Sincerely, Li Liejun, Zhou Guanhong, Xu Yuangao, Yang Gengsheng, Luo Jiaheng, Pan Xuehai, Wen Jincheng, Li Guozhen, Tao Jiayao, Liu Zhigang, Hu Tingluan, Xiao Bingzhang, Ye Renfang, Wei Tiaoyuan, Li Shouchcheng, and others, council members of the Jiangxi Public Association.</p>
<p>The Middle School Students Union Sends Telegrams to Various Generals: The Middle School Students Union yesterday sent telegrams to various generals, (titles omitted). Since the violent Japanese forcefully occupied the three northeastern provinces, their policy of active aggression has continued unabated. Recently, they provoked incidents in Shanghai, attacking our stationed troops and massacring our people. All of our citizens are gnashing their teeth and raising their arms, filled with indignation and deep hatred. Fortunately, our loyal and brave 19th Route Army, fulfilling the duty of soldiers to defend the territory and with the determination to die, bravely fights the enemy, persevering despite setbacks. Since the beginning of the resistance, they have been working tirelessly for ten days and nights, and we deeply admire them. However, the enemy is mobilizing its entire nation to support Shanghai, and the disparity in numbers between our forces is a cause for deep concern. Our union expresses its utmost sincerity in requesting all generals and soldiers across the country to provide substantial assistance to the 19th Route Army. This would be fortunate for the people of the entire nation and fortunate for the Republic of China. We urgently present our case, hoping for your understanding.</p>
<h3>Replies from Various Generals to Sun Yan's Telegram</h3>
<p>Willing to Serve as Vanguard: Telegraph to the Capital Requesting Orders</p>
<p>Rather Break Like Jade Than Survive as Tile: Unwavering Loyalty</p>
<p>Sun Lianzhong's telegram to Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Li Delin, and Messrs. Chen, Ma, Zhang, Xue, Cheng, Chen, Liu, Liang, Fu, Fang, Li, Huang, Sun, Xiong, and Gui: "Having read your telegram with great respect, I am deeply moved by your concern for the nation's crisis due to the violent Japanese invasion and your call to awaken the people to join the national crisis. Lianzhong and all the officers and soldiers are determined to avenge the national humiliation and are willing to serve as the vanguard, vowing to take up arms to defend the party and the nation. In addition to having already telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission to request orders, I hereby reply for your information. Respectfully, Sun Lianzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the 26th Route Army, leading all officers and soldiers."</p>
<p>Song Tiancai's Telegram: To Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Li Delin, Mr. Fang Shuping, Mr. Li Wenfan, Mr. Chen Youren, Mr. Ma Chaojun, Mr. Zhang Xianghua, Mr. Cheng Songyun, Mr. Xue Ziliang, Mr. Fu Rulin, Mr. Chen Qingyun, Mr. Huang Jilu, Mr. Gui Zongji, Mr. Sun Jingya, and Mr. Liang Hancao, members of the Central Committee in Shanghai. The Japanese invaders are arrogant and disregard international relations, sending troops to Shenyang and then attacking Jinzhou. Recently, they have disturbed Shanghai and invaded Zhabei, taking an inch and wanting a mile. Their flames of ferocity are spreading. All those with blood and qi are filled with indignation. The officers and soldiers of our 19th Route Army, motivated by patriotic zeal, are making a just defense and have achieved repeated victories. I am deeply impressed. Your telegram has further inspired me to strive forward. Tiancai, humbly serving in the military, has dedicated himself to the nation, and his ambition to defend the country and resist foreign aggression remains unchanged. I previously telegraphed requesting to serve, hoping that you would notice. The situation is pressing, and I dare not lag behind. I am willing to lead my brave soldiers as the vanguard for the nation, preferring to break like jade than survive as tile, and will not hesitate to fulfill my duty. I am armed and awaiting orders, respectfully awaiting your clear instructions. I humbly express my sincerity, hoping for your consideration. Respectfully, Song Tiancai, Commander of the 75th Division."</p>
<p>Zhang Fang's Telegram: (Title Omitted) "Since the Japanese invaders occupied Shenyang, their brutal and beastly actions and their policy of active aggression have been evident to all. Our central government has been compromising and tolerating, repeatedly waiting for the League of Nations to impose sanctions. However, they have taken an inch and wanted a mile, pressing forward aggressively. Even after our side accepted their demands, they occupied Zhabei, invaded our defense lines, massacred our people, and burned our houses, disregarding humanity and disrupting peace. This is a deep hatred for the entire nation and a particular shame for soldiers. Fang, awaiting punishment in southern Henan and responsible for suppressing the communists, heard the news of the disaster from afar, and his hair stood on end in anger. I think of the divine land of China, with its brilliant mountains and rivers, passed down from the Yellow Emperor to the present, for over four thousand years. How can we allow it to be lost to others? If the time is lost, I am willing to perish with it. As long as there is breath, how can I allow myself to slacken? I have already encouraged my soldiers to quickly quell the communist threat and am also preparing my horses and sharpening my weapons, quietly awaiting orders, ready to go through fire and water, vowing not to refuse. I also hope that all the generals and soldiers will fight together and strive for survival, determined not to allow our territory to change color or our nation to be submerged, so as not to bring endless shame to the world. Armed and awaiting orders, I am filled with grief and indignation. Respectfully, Zhang Fang, Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Route Army."</p>
<p>Lü Chao's Telegram: (Title Omitted) "Brothers, you and the loyal and brave soldiers have been fighting hard for weeks, repeatedly annihilating the strong enemy. Your righteous reputation has spread far and wide, and all admire you. I am limited by my official duties and have moved to Luoyang with the government, unable to serve at the front, which I deeply regret. I hope to be informed of the situation in Shanghai at all times. I sincerely send my greetings and wish you victory. Respectfully, Lü Chao."</p>
<h3>National Salvation Opinions from Various Sectors</h3>
<p>Gu Mingjiu's Telegram: Commander of the First Column of the Second Route of the National Salvation Army sends a telegram to resist Japan, stating: "Forward to all compatriots nationwide via newspaper offices, Since the violent Japanese have used force in the northeastern provinces, turning them into foreign territory, they have recently disregarded humanity and violated international conventions, using all their sea, land, and air forces to destroy Shanghai, the national commercial center. The lives and property of the citizens of Zhabei, sacrificed under the Japanese invaders' artillery fire, are countless. Their cruel methods have reached this extreme. Fortunately, all the officers and soldiers of our 19th Route Army are determined to defend the territory and are making a just resistance. Although the Japanese invaders have suffered heavy blows for days, reinforcements continue to arrive. Mingjiu and others, as members of the nation, dare not forget the duty of every citizen. They have been appointed to organize the National Salvation Army, vowing to save the country and protect the people, and to eliminate the Japanese invaders as their mission, acting as the vanguard of the people and the rearguard of the national army, armed and ready, and unwavering in their righteousness. We humbly present our case for your consideration. Gu Mingjiu, Commander of the First Column of the Second Route of the National Salvation Army, Deputy Commander Liu Jikuan, First Detachment Ding Bingkun, Second Detachment Chen Jisheng, Third Detachment Shi Chaozhu, and others respectfully."</p>
<p>Yu Jiegao's Telegram: Yu Jie yesterday sent a telegram stating: "To the Honorable Premier Lin, President Wang, Chairman Jiang, government officials, and all citizens, World evolution values enlightenment most highly. The former declaration without war and the current war without declaration both suffer from empty embellishment, insufficient to establish a nation. Today's change is indeed defense rather than war. The resistance at Black Wall and Shanghai Harbor, and the disturbances by the valiant people outside the border, merely express self-defense, slightly revealing that the government can endure humiliation, but the people will definitely not accept insults. Even if there are treaties to cede territory, it will be difficult to subdue them with high pressure. Recently, I heard that the great powers are guaranteeing world peace and have five articles to mediate between China and Japan, and jointly urge them to withdraw their troops first. Our country, adhering to the national character of benevolence and concession, has already accepted the five articles, while Japan is still stubbornly refusing. For Japan's sake, violent behavior harms others and harms oneself. Loving benevolence is loving the country. For our government's sake, we must take the brave do not necessarily have benevolence as a warning, and deeply understand the ancient teaching that the benevolent must be brave. For half a year, the will of heaven and the people has been clearly revealed. Natural disasters and strange warnings, the people's spirit is high. To save the crisis, determine the national policy early, without taking the roundabout of the National Crisis Conference, and even less waiting for the creation of the National Assembly. Jie is like a dried fish, unable to clap the electricity, I respectfully present this in place of my fear, Anhui refugee Yu Jiegao, hundred knocks first.</p>
<h3>Those with Ambition Should Take on Rear Area Work</h3>
<p>Transporting Munitions, Digging Trenches</p>
<p>Many hands are needed</p>
<p>Yesterday, a person named Zhang Bingfu sent a letter to this newspaper, stating: "During the European War, many Chinese workers were recruited to go abroad to serve as laborers. These workers were generally responsible for rear-area work, such as transporting munitions and digging trenches, which was crucial to the war effort. Now that the Japanese invaders have come and war has broken out, our 19th Route Army soldiers are bravely fighting the enemy. The various important tasks and miscellaneous affairs in the rear area will require a great number of hands. Among our comrades in the industrial and commercial circles, there is no shortage of patriots who, although unable to serve on the battlefield, will be happy to engage in rear-area work. If a recruiting agency can be established, this matter will be even easier to carry out."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Urges Donations to Comfort and Aid Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce believes that the 19th Route Army has worked hard to resist foreign aggression and defend the nation, sacrificing themselves for the country, which is truly worthy of respect. Yesterday, it specially urged all sectors to donate money to comfort and aid the families of the fallen soldiers on the front lines, to comfort their heroic spirits and encourage morale. The public notice is recorded as follows: "According to the proposal of the Chaozhou Native Association in Shanghai, the officers and soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the country in this battle against Japan should be supported by the people who raise money to provide for their families and seek good aftermath. The telegraph requests endorsement. This association believes that this move is sufficient to boost morale, so that our soldiers have no worries, affecting operations, which is extremely important. All sectors who agree to this move can deposit the cash they donate in the bank they designate and report it to this association. After a certain amount has been collected, it will be remitted to the frontline military authorities for fair distribution. This is a public announcement."</p>
<h3>Relief Work Intensifies</h3>
<p>Over a Thousand Refugees Evacuated from War Zone: The Municipal War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association has rescued and accommodated over one thousand refugees as of yesterday. Its lodgings are insufficient, so it is constantly expanding. There were previously eight locations, and two new ones were added yesterday, for a total of ten. The investigation of each lodging is as follows: (1) Gu'en Temple (2) Qingliang Temple (3) Liu Residence on Avenue Albert (4) Baseball field (already under the Women's and Children's Association) (5) Zhenhai Temple (in Xiaonanmen) (6) Xiaolingshan (Xiaonanmen) (7) Jinrong School (13 Kangti Road) (8) Dalu Department Store (Shandong Road) (9) Furun Lane, Beijing Road (10) Huitong School, Avenue Joffre, French Concession.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Consoles Wounded Soldiers and Civilians</h3>
<p>The Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Mai Zhaoshu, accompanied by section chiefs Zhang Binghui and Zeng Shengdian, and clerks Zhou Yongxing and Zhu Fuzeng, yesterday visited various hospitals of the Red Cross to comfort the wounded soldiers and civilians, bringing hundreds of biscuits and towels, distributing them by name, and expressing their condolences. According to the persons in charge of each hospital, what is currently needed are cotton quilts, cotton, bandages, gauze, and fruits. Any wounded soldiers or civilians are mostly sent to the Red Cross General Hospital on Avenue Haig, which weighs the severity of the injuries and distributes them to various hospitals. The association also established three branch hospitals in Wusong and Zhenru to rescue wounded soldiers and civilians. Because the location of the general hospital is not suitable, it plans to establish a rear hospital in Suzhou to carry out its work. There are currently one hundred and fifty to sixty members of the rescue team, mostly medical students and nurses from the hospital, who are very attentive to the wounded soldiers and civilians. The bureau also issued a letter to the compatriots in the war zone yesterday, saying: "The disaster is imminent, and the national crisis is frequent. The bloodstains in Liaodong have not yet dried, and the smoke of war in northern Shanghai has risen again. Those violent people are increasing their ferocity, displaying their poisonous flames, taking an inch and wanting a mile, waging war without a declaration, slaughtering our people like chickens and dogs, and turning Chinese houses into ruins. They are recklessly disregarding and violating public morality, destroying humanity, and letting so-called plainclothes ruffians go out to burn and kill, plunging the prosperous areas of Shanghai into a world of terror. Alas, the Chinese people, those who have not been buried in gunfire and are fortunate enough to be saved from the tiger's mouth, are few and far between. Zhaoshu awaits punishment in this country, and his job is incompetent. Because the disaster started suddenly, the war was started by the other side, and the advance warnings were unable to move away, and the subsequent cries for help were not strong enough to save them, his worries were like a pounding, and his hot blood was in vain. Fortunately, the patriotic warriors are sacrificing their lives to resist, and people from all walks of life are working together to support them. It is a fact that the country can be saved, and the people's hearts are not dead. I maintain that I am insignificant, and even if I cannot charge forward with weapons and serve the country, my duty lies in not forgetting to know the things that can be done in rescuing and accepting, so as to slightly comfort my fathers, elders, brothers and sisters in the remaining turmoil, and to redeem myself from my guilt. I have now contacted all parties to receive the address and find ways to protect and transport all the fellow victims to leave the dangerous situation. Those who wish to stay in Shanghai or return to their hometown should report in detail on the day of exiting the danger, so that they can be handled one by one. As for the subsequent resettlement, unemployment and aftermath, all local issues should be planned comprehensively after the expulsion of the stubborn invaders and the military announcement of a section, so as to seek a complete solution. When it comes to the moment when the gasping is just right, what should be sincerely told to the elders, brothers and sisters is that after this danger, we should strictly abide by the order, seek self-organization, or publicize the enemy's brutality, so that everyone has the heart to kill the thief, or explain the military situation so that there are plans to save the country everywhere. There is no need to be discouraged, and there is no need to be pessimistic. We must know that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world. Today's ups and downs, the hardships and hardships, are the result of laboring their muscles and bones, suffering their minds and minds, and preparing for the future, so that the Chinese nation can breathe a sigh of relief. With one heart and one mind, we should work together to encourage ourselves."</p>
<h3>Joint Office of Various Bureaus: Relief Work</h3>
<p>(1) The staff members sent to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway area to contact and accommodate refugees have returned to Shanghai. It is reported that Songjiang and Jiashan can accommodate 2,000 refugees, but food and supplies must be subsidized by Shanghai. Jiaxing can accommodate 6,000 people, jointly managed by political and commercial associations. Xiashi can accommodate 1,000 people, and funding is available. Hangzhou can accommodate tens of thousands of people, managed by local agencies and organizations. All localities are extremely enthusiastic about accommodating refugees. (2) In order to prevent tetanus from occurring in wounded soldiers (according to the fact that bullets that have been shot into the human body after passing through the soil, or that the wound is contaminated with soil, can be infected with tetanus), methods are being sought to purchase tetanus serum from various places. Eight hundred bottles have been purchased and allocated to various hospitals and the Red Cross for application. (3) The approximate number of refugees accommodated in various places, according to the office's investigation, is as follows: Boy Scouts Council, about 3,000 people; Gu'en Temple, 274 people; Civic Federation, about 5,000 people; Dalu Department Store, more than 200 people; Siming Public Hall, more than 500 people; Shandong Guild Hall, more than 300 people; 751 Avenue Albert, more than 350 people; China Moral Association, more than 200 people; Lingshan Temple, 46 people; Minzhi Middle School, 109 people.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Teams' Relief Work</h3>
<p>The captain of the first rescue team of the Chinese Red Cross, Hai Zongqi, went to Datong Road, Gonghe Xin Road, and Song Park Road in Zhabei at 1:00 p.m. and rescued Zhao Biezhong, a platoon leader who had a machine gun wound in his left arm, and soldiers Xiang Zhicai and Li Tinghui, who had leg injuries. He also rescued more than 70 refugees, including Jiang Lisheng, from Taiyuanfang, Zhongxing Road. Xue Zhenyi, the captain of the second rescue team, departed at 8:00 a.m. and went to the area of Qiujiang Road, Baoshan Road, Baoxing Road, and Gonghe Xin Road. He rescued three wounded soldiers, Wen Shangde, Yin Guihai, and Zhao Jinsheng, all from Hunan, and sent them to the Fifth Hospital. He also rescued more than 50 refugees on Gonghe Xin Road. Shi Zhijie, the captain of the third detachment, departed at 9:00 a.m. and went to the area of Zhongxing Road, Yongxing Road, and Hongxing Road in Zhabei, rescuing more than 20 refugees. Except for five people who had nowhere to go and were sent to Renjitang for care, the rest went to relatives and friends in the concession on their own. In addition, Lu Hongyuan led rescuers to the battlefield and transported back three wounded soldiers. The rescue team of the Medical College of Zhongda, in the fourth detachment, has received rescue and medical supplies and comfort money and food for the wounded soldiers donated by various parties, and they have been distributed in full. It is said that the front urgently needs surgical medical equipment and supplies, while the rear has too many biscuits and is eager to supply fruits and milk. It is hoped that all parties will continue to provide assistance. The team also received 100 quilts and 54 blankets from Zhu Ziqiao, 1,280 pieces of cotton clothing, 35 pieces of cotton clothing from the Flood Relief Association, 32 pieces of cotton clothing from Yang Jijun, 200 pieces from the Health Bureau, 300 packages of gauze and 1,000 packages of absorbent cotton from Wuzhou Pharmacy, 550 small rolls of bandage cloth from Ms. Zhong Sun Shenfang, one quilt and thirteen pieces of old clothes of various sizes from Chen Bingqian, 40 quilts from Renjitang, 18 kinds of medicines from Meidi Geng Foreign Company, 34 handkerchiefs and 34 packages of biscuits from the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and silver dollars and biscuits from the Chaozhou Native Association in Shanghai (delivered personally by the comers). Wu Yunqing, the captain of the ninth detachment, rescued two refugees who were bombed in Zhabei and sent them to Shanghai Hospital. Zhou Lianze, the captain of the eleventh detachment, went to Zhenru and transported back fifteen lightly wounded soldiers and three seriously wounded soldiers. One person died on the way, named Yang Liangyan. Ye Zhisheng, the captain of the eighth detachment, rescued seven wounded soldiers, Li Kuicai, Qin Xuecheng, Jin Bingliu, Lü Gang, Li Mo, Ying Xiongzheng, and Yang Zuo, and two wounded civilians in Dachang. Rescue worker Lu Bochang was wounded in the left leg by a bomb dropped by a plane on Zhongxing Road.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Circulating Medical Team</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society believes that refugees in various shelters are prone to illness in a frightened and starved environment. It has formed a medical team attached to the rescue team, selecting male physician Zhang Zhisheng, female physician Chen Jingfang, and nurses Dai Zibiao and Zhang Ranbai, to carry medicines and conduct daily circulating diagnosis. In addition to sending seriously ill patients to the hospital, minor illnesses are diagnosed and treated on the spot.</p>
<h3>Refugees Rescued in the Hongkou Area</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross and the Shanghai War Zone Temporary Refugee Relief Association cooperated. The Red Cross rescue team, led by She Shuyun, Wu Guirong, Li Zu, Wang Chusheng, and others, along with six cars from the China Transportation Company, with one car from the Japanese Business Group because they were able to pass through the Japanese position, rescued several hundred Chinese refugees. She Shuyun also departed at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, took a letter from the Public Works Bureau on Sanma Road, passed through the Bund, Wusong Road, Shenjiawan, the Japanese Headquarters, and went to Ouja Road, to Nanfeng Le Lane, Zhaoxing Lane, Wuxing Lane, Wude Lane on Tissot Road, and then to Yongan Lane and Fushan Lane on Bao'an Road, Rongfu Lane and Shouyin Lane on Qimei Road, Yuanmao Lane on Yangjia Bang Road, and Hujia Mu Bridge, Makari Lane, Tongjia Lane, and Guangyao Lane on Ba Tong Road, rescuing more than 300 refugees.</p>
<h3>Ferries Borrowed to Send Refugees</h3>
<p>The joint office of various bureaus of the municipal government is consulting with the war zone refugee temporary relief association to borrow the ferries on the Huangpu River to send refugees to safe counties such as Kunshan and Changshu. The office has decided to allocate Ferry No. 5, saying that because the ferry is related to bank loans, the association must bear considerable responsibility, and if there is damage, it must be compensated accordingly. The association has replied to the municipal government requesting permission to borrow the ferry to benefit the refugees.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society's Work in Two Days</h3>
<p>On February 5th, the first relief team of the Society departed at 7:00 a.m., from McGann Road Bridge to Zhongshan Road, Zhongxing Road, and Baoshan Road, rescuing eighteen wounded soldiers, including Xi Liusheng, who were all transported by car to the Society's temporary hospital on Xieqiao. The second team departed at 8:00 a.m. and went to the area of Baochang Road and Baotong Road, rescuing fourteen wounded soldiers, who were transported by car to the Society's hospital. More than 140 refugees were also rescued. In the afternoon, the two teams departed at the same time and rescued more than 60 refugees and twenty-two wounded soldiers, including Wu Fuxing, in the area of Zhongshan Road and the Sun Temple, and sent them to the Society's hospital and the refugee women and children's center, respectively. Because there were too many people and they could not be accommodated, a second women and children's shelter was added to the Sports Advancement Association on the Astronomical Terrace Road. On February 6th, the first and second relief teams of the Society departed at 8:00 a.m. from McGann Road to the Sun Temple, Zhongxing Road, rescuing wounded soldiers Zhang Zhenhai, Li Juyou, Wang Fulin, Liu Xianyi, Zhong Xin, Lai Shi, and Liang Zhengqing, as well as nine civilians, including Zhang Zhu and Zhou Ma, and more than 80 refugees, who were sent to the Society's hospital and the Society's first and second shelters. In the afternoon, the third team departed at 3:00 p.m., from McGann Road straight to Liuying Road, rescuing more than 160 refugees. The two shelters were full, so a third shelter was added to the Dalu Department Store, with presidents Tian Xiuben and Li Cikai in charge. However, the new barracks and reed houses are all housing refugees who were previously affected by the floods. Because of the recent falling bombs, the disaster victims have scattered to hide, and some have not cooked for three or four days, and have no cold food to eat. It is hoped that the Flood Disaster Association will pay attention to these disaster victims who are adding fuel to the fire.</p>
<h3>Document from the Sanshan Guild Hall to the Social Bureau</h3>
<p>The Sanshan Guild Hall on Fuzhou Road submits a document to the Social Bureau in reply, stating: In reply to the matter, we received your Bureau's Order No. 734, which fully narrates the causes, etc. Upon investigation, since the outbreak of the Battle of Zhabei, the Fuzhou people in Shanghai who have sought refuge at our guild hall have already filled it up completely, leaving no space. We have not seen any Chen E and more than a hundred others come to the guild hall requesting accommodation. The accusation of publicly rejecting them is groundless. Because the Fuzhou refugees had no way to return to their hometowns, our guild hall, with the utmost effort, negotiated with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. to request them to order the Hesheng steamboat to sail directly to Shantou and then turn into the Fuzhou ports. The company replied that a minimum of 500 tickets would be required. The price of the tickets was repeatedly negotiated and agreed upon at seven yuan each. If there were fewer than 500 tickets, the shortfall would be borne by our guild hall, to which our guild hall fully agreed. After the ship sailed, the calculation of the ticket shortfall totaled more than 1,300 yuan, which was immediately covered by the members of our guild hall. The facts are there. Our guild hall believes that such planning demonstrates our enthusiasm for our hometown. As for the ticket price of seven yuan per ticket, a public notice was issued everywhere, and the Xiangbin Hotel was entrusted to sell the tickets on our behalf, which can also be verified. Chen E has falsely accused us of profiteering, which is heartless. As for our guild hall accommodating refugees, it is our duty and has already been fully implemented, not awaiting your Bureau's explicit order. Due to the above reasons, we hereby declare the factual situation and respectfully request your inspection.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Qiuping also sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday regarding this matter, saying: Dear Sir, I read in today's edition of your esteemed newspaper about the Social Bureau's order to the Sanshan Guild Hall to accommodate refugees. It mentioned that the Sanshan Guild Hall specially hired the Hesheng steamboat to sail to Fuzhou under the guise of rescuing fellow villagers and sold 600 tickets at 7.5 yuan each, which is no different from taking advantage of the disaster for profit. I am extremely astonished. Apart from the details of hiring the Hesheng steamboat, which will be clarified separately by the person in charge of the Sanshan Guild Hall, the sales of the boat tickets were entrusted to me by the directors of the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association affiliated with the Sanshan Guild Hall, namely Mr. Chen Xiangxiong, Mr. Chen Daqi, and Mr. Wang Yufu. As the matter was a voluntary service, I could not decline. The ticket price was set at seven yuan each, and a public notice was posted at the entrance of the Fellow Villagers Association and outside the gate of my company. Especially because of the urgent time constraints and concerns that it would be difficult to inform everyone, I sent announcements to various ticket agencies, entrusting them to post notices and promising to pay a 5% commission for each ticket sold. This is a brief summary of the ticket sales process. Now I submit the account book of the ticket sales and hope you will publish it to clarify the truth. The boat tickets were all sold at seven yuan each by the staff of my company's accounting department, and I also assisted from the side. If there was any price gouging for profit, then I dare to bear the crime of taking advantage of the disaster. I hope that the Fuzhou people, Mr. Chen E, etc., will come forward to testify. As for how I have conducted myself in the business world for more than twenty years, there will be public opinion, so there is no need to elaborate. The number of boat tickets sold is as follows: A total of 244 Hesheng steamboat tickets were sold for 7 yuan each, totaling 1,708 yuan. After deducting the 7 jiao commission paid to the Shuntai Ticket Agency (receipt available), the actual amount received was 1,707 yuan and 3 jiao.

<h3>The Corpse of a Quartermaster is Coffin-Bound and Buried with Generosity</h3>
<p>The Jishi Hui Red Cross Rescue Team rescued a quartermaster named Guo Zhenying at around 11:00 AM on the 5th at a location near the front line on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei. He had suffered a head wound from enemy machine-gun fire. He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment, but he died en route due to the severity of his injuries. His body was then transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall and requested for coffin burial. The hall considered that the deceased sacrificed himself to defend the people and protect the country, and his merits were with the Party and the country. Therefore, it issued a superior-grade coffin and clothing for coffin burial to comfort the loyal soul and encourage the soldiers on the front line.</p>
<h3>Charitable Organizations Collect Corpses</h3>
<p>After the violent Japanese troops dispatched soldiers to attack Zhabei, various charitable organizations in this port city successively formed rescue teams and have been collecting, over the past few days, from the battle area of Zhabei the bodies of innocent civilians, both male and female, young and old, who had been killed by bombs dropped by violent Japanese airplanes and stabbed to death by barbaric and unreasonable beastly soldiers with bare hands, totaling several hundred. On the previous two days, they were transported separately to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall at the west end of Dongxinqiao Street, Ningbo Road, in the French Concession. Yesterday morning, the hall ordered many laborers to prepare coffins for burial. Then, four trucks were hired to transport the coffins to Huangpu Beach, transferred to barges to cross the river, and transported to the public cemetery in Pudong for burial.</p>
<h3>The Hongkou Fire Brigade Rescues Refugees</h3>
<p>Chen Yi, a native of Xinhui, Guangdong, suffering from paralysis, lived with his two daughters in Sanduoli, Qiujiang Road, North Sichuan Road. Because it was within the war zone, they were unable to escape. They had not had food for several days. Fortunately, the Hongkou Fire Brigade arrived at the scene to put out a fire at 11:00 AM yesterday and discovered them. The district chief of the brigade, a British man named Miller, the special captain Ye Biyun, and team leaders He and Li urgently notified the Central District to dispatch an ambulance to the scene. The father and daughters were rescued and sent to the Young Women's Christian Association on Nanjing Road for shelter. Mr. Miller, sympathizing with their misfortune, specially assisted them with 10 yuan. According to Chen, he has two sons, one working at Mobil Oil on Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Shelters Over a Thousand Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The Standing Committee members of the 22nd District Branch of the Shanghai West Jing'an Temple Citizens' United Association, Wang Hancheng, Xu Wenyuan, Gong Yifei, Cai Jiugao, Wang Banjiang, etc., in view of the fact that this violent Japanese invasion of Shanghai has caused disaster victims in the war zone to be displaced and without food or clothing, suffering terrible calamities and in a pitiful state, specially convened with the abbot of Jing'an Temple, Zhifa, and local gentry Gu Jiatang, Zhang Pinshan, Gong Yuequan, Chen Haitang, Tan Wenwei, etc., to organize the Shanghai War Zone Disaster Victims Shelter, using Jing'an Temple as the location to relieve the war zone disaster victims. Since it opened on the 30th of last month, more than 1,300 fellow compatriots have sought refuge, making it extremely crowded. It is heard that the shelter's funding is temporarily provided by donations from members of the 22nd District Citizens' Association and local philanthropists, and no one is entrusted to solicit donations from various organizations or send people outside to solicit donations. If philanthropists generously donate funds or clothing and food, they must be delivered directly to the shelter.</p>
<h3>The Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association Establishes Additional Shelters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association, Ma Shaoquan, Rong Zongjing, Wang Yaochen, Tao Renqian, Feng Yunchu, etc., previously established shelters at the Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road and the Continental Department Store to provide relief to fellow villagers in distress and made arrangements to send them back to their hometowns. Now, due to increasingly rampant rumors in Wuxi, Suzhou, etc., they have decided to stop sending people back and because there are so many fellow villagers in distress, all the shelters mentioned above are insufficient. Therefore, yesterday they established a third shelter at the old site of the Baofeng Money Exchange at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Henan Road.</p>
<h3>The Guangdong Fellow Villagers' Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Zhabei Incident, the Cantonese have suffered the most, so the Guangdong Fellow Villagers in Shanghai specially established the Guangdong Fellow Villagers' Relief Association at the Guangzhao Public Hall to engage in rescue and shelter for refugees. As of the 6th of this month, in addition to those who have been funded and sent back to Guangdong, there are still 220 people staying in the Public Hall, 580 people at the Catholic Church on Tonglu Road, and 690 people at the Jade Buddha Temple on Beichengdu Road, totaling over 1,500 people. The number of people continuing to arrive at the Public Hall seeking shelter continues unabated. The association's organization is divided into fifteen groups including general affairs, secretary, accounting, condolence, public relations, correspondence, publicity, supply, health, discipline, telephone, transportation, general affairs, inspection, and audit, working together diligently. People from all walks of life have also donated supplies to temporarily sustain the lives of the refugees.

<p>Depart" The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union Scouts organized six teams totaling over sixty people yesterday (the 7th), led by the head of the group, Lin Shaosen, and trainers Shen Fu and Wang Dingyu, to go to the war zone to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. "Four Scouts Still Not Released" Four scouts from the City Chamber of Commerce and a driver, as well as six staff members of the Chinese Red Cross Society, hired a car on the 1st to rescue the family of a certain staff member of the Chinese Red Cross Society on North Sichuan Road. Because the car did not carry the Red Cross flag, it was forcibly taken away by the Japanese army. Although the Red Cross Society once negotiated with the Japanese consulate, they have not been released yet.</p>
<h3>Patients at Bosheng Hospital Escape Danger</h3>

The rear hospital is planned to be set up in the French Concession, Dapuqiao, at the Political Science and Law College. It is heard that the department has already started the process.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Condolences and the Initiation of the Thanksgiving Association</h3>
<p>Lay Buddhist Ping Xing wrote to the people of the country, saying: "The soldiers who are fighting against the Japanese army this time are all our benefactors, flesh and blood of the nation. Everyone should give them extraordinary respect with heroic titles such as 'Gratitude,' 'Valor,' and 'Loyalty.' Those who have died heroically should be posthumously titled with the 'Gratitude and Martyrdom' title, and temples should be built to worship them. Their wives and children should be generously cared for. I am willing to do my best and contribute 500 yuan first. I hope that the people of the country will quickly organize a Thanksgiving Association to comfort the front lines and repay the deceased martyrs."</p>
<h3>The City Federation Yesterday Visited the Fighting Soldiers</h3>
<p>The City Federation sent condolence representatives Liu Zhongying, Wang Jian'e, Chen Binghui, Jiang Junyi, and others at 9:00 AM yesterday, hiring four cars and loading them with condolence items, including two bicycles, thirty-three raincoats, five pieces of biscuits, and a large bag of New Year cakes, and personally delivered them to the headquarters of the 156th Brigade at Dachang to express their admiration.</p>

<h3>The General Labor Union Sends Members to Various Ports to Promote Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Everyone Should Do Their Best and Unite to Save the Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members yesterday and decided to send members to various ports to speak about the bombing of Zhabei by the violent Japanese and the self-defense operations of the 19th Route Army, so that various places can understand the truth of the Shanghai Incident and actively unite to resist Japan and do their best to assist the 19th Route Army. It is now heard that three groups have been formed, each with two to three people. The first group's route departs from Shanghai and passes through Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and various counties under their jurisdiction. The second group passes through Songjiang, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Nanxun, and Huzhou. The third group passes through Shanghai, Ningbo Line, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and other places. They are currently preparing their luggage and compiling printed materials and will depart soon.</p>
<h3>Smuggling a Large Batch of Japanese Coal</h3>
<p>Discovered by the Coal Industry Association</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reported that the Shanghai Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau on North Suzhou Road smuggled as many as 43 tons of Japanese coal yesterday. Two barges from a certain company transported them to the entrance of the bureau for unloading, which was discovered by inspectors from the Coal Industry Association. They went to the bureau to negotiate. The person in charge of the bureau first made excuses and evaded responsibility, then admitted it without hesitation. The Japanese coal was temporarily seized. It is heard that the association believes that during this violent Japanese military action on the Shanghai coast, where bullets are flying and blood is splattering, the Shanghai Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau, believing that no one would inspect them after the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was forced to disband, dared to smuggle Japanese goods, which is extremely hateful. It will convene a meeting to discuss the most severe measures to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Renowned Domestic Scholar Li Shicen Disappears</h3>
<p>Li Shicen, the former editor of the "Xuedeng" column of the "Shishi Xinbao" and chief editor of the "Education Magazine" of the Commercial Press, is a renowned domestic scholar of our time, with abundant writings. He taught philosophy at various schools in Shanghai and was highly regarded. Last month, the central government appointed him as a member of the National Crisis Conference. It is heard that Mr. Li returned to China from studying in Germany in the spring of last year and rented a house at No. 18, Jingyunli, Donghengbang Road, Zhabei, Shanghai. After the Sino-Japanese military conflict broke out on the 28th of last month, his whereabouts have been unknown. His family in Suzhou and friends in Shanghai have been trying to find out about his recent situation, but without any leads. It is further heard that several of his outstanding students, including Zhang Yaohua, were living with Li and are also missing. If anyone knows the whereabouts of Mr. Li and others, please inform Mr. Yang Zaigao of this newspaper.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Departure of the Merchant Corps and Chinese Police for Defense</h3>
<p>With the Japanese soldiers invading the territory and the fog of war permeating the air, the Merchant Corps and Chinese Police have the responsibility to maintain local law and order. Therefore, when the 128 Incident began, an order to mobilize was issued. After normalization, preparations were made, and no fewer than three hundred people responded to the call. They then cooperated with the British and American forces to guard key positions for defense. Wang Yanjing, the commander of the corps, fearing that the refugees might have language barriers with the Westerners, dispatched Chinese police officers to serve as interpreters at the borders between the Chinese and foreign concessions, where foreign troops were stationed, to avoid misunderstandings. As a result, officers of all levels in the corps who were proficient in English wore military uniforms and carried guns to work as interpreters. Some were also sent to the banks on Avenue Edouard VII, Rue de l'Amiral Courbet, North Henan Road, and Xinjiang Road to provide armed guards, working day and night tirelessly. Those who evaded danger or failed to perform their duties were immediately dismissed, including probationary sergeant Shi Binggui, officers He Chuqiao, Xu Binkui, Wang Jiasui, Wang Luping, Liu Shikun, and probationary officers Wang Jiren, Wu Rongbai, Zhang Huaide, Yang Zhongqin, etc., a total of ten.</p>
<p>Tight Franco-Chinese Defense</p>
<h3>The Self-Defense Corps Strictly Guards Along the Bank of the River</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South District Self-Defense Corps' ten teams, except for the tenth team, led by Zhou Chengxiang, which is responsible for the defense of Xujiahui, the team leaders of the first to ninth teams, Gao Ziyun, Xu Derun, Qian Qiaosun, Feng Runsheng, Shao Daren, Chen Shoukang, and Zeng Liyuan, held a joint defense meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to strengthen the defense along the Huangpu River. From last night onwards, there are several hundred military police and Self-Defense Corps members guarding the Guanjiao Wharf, Ningshao Wharf, Dongmen Road Wharf, Dongjiadu Wharf, and the area along the beach of the First District Police Station. Curfew was imposed early at 8:00 PM, preventing people from traveling to and from the area, to protect the Huangpu River and maintain local safety.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Remains Peaceful as Usual</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in northern Shanghai, the French Concession has been fortunate to have the French consul and police officers do their best to maintain order and provide very thorough protection. Therefore, the shops and residents in the concession remain calm as usual. On New Year's Eve, the shops selling dried goods, candies, and food remained open as usual. The French Tramway Company still operates the trams on all routes from the Bund to Xujiahui, Rue Massenet, and Zikawei. However, Routes 6, 21, and 22 buses from Xiaobeimen have returned to service. Route 4 trams from Tilanqiao to Rue Massenet also resumed service the day before yesterday. The French garrison still dispatches soldiers in tanks and armored vehicles to guard the intersections between the Chinese, British, and French concessions, together with the Chinese and foreign constables dispatched by the police station. The detective officers on duty patrol armed throughout the concession.</p>
<h3>The War Affects Education in the Concessions</h3>
<p>Elementary Schools in the Northern District and the Chinese Public School Postpone the Start of the School Term</p>
<p>Elementary schools in the Eastern and Western Districts and other schools proceed as usual</p>
<p>Aside from the losses suffered by merchants and residents, the Zhabei Incident of the previous night has greatly affected Chinese education in the concessions. The Public Works Department North District Elementary School on Amherst Avenue was garrisoned by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the International Settlement from 6:00 PM on the 27th. The Heske Road Chinese Public School, which is close to the war zone, has also had its opening arrangements greatly hindered and announced the postponement of the start of the school term yesterday. However, the Eastern District Elementary School on Boone Road, the Western District Elementary School on Edinburgh Road, the Public Works Department Girls' Middle School on Ma Teshisituo Road, and other Public Works Department schools are far from the war zone and will start the school term on the original scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ruigui Telegraphed News of Shantou's Current Situation</h3>
<p>The Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai received a telegram from Zhang, the division commander in Shantou, yesterday, saying, "To the comrades of the Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai: I have received your telegram. The violent Japanese want to use a gunboat policy to disturb our coastal trading ports. They previously used the Shantou newspaper incident as a pretext for intimidation. I have protested based on reason and have achieved a peaceful resolution. However, the Shanghai Incident has not ended. Our army has actively prepared. If there is any violent action, we will do our best to deal with it and will never yield. Please rest assured. Your brother, Zhang Ruigui."</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Halted Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Only Guangfu Exited in the Dawn</p>
<p>The merchant ships scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo yesterday afternoon include Fulong, Fengpu, Shengan (Sanbei Company), Yongxing, Xin Ningshao (Ningshao Company), Tunan (China Merchants Bureau), and Guangfu (Sanfa Company), a total of seven. Except for Guangfu, which safely exited the port as early as 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the other six ships were scheduled to set sail in the afternoon. However, due to the outbreak of the war in Wusong, they were all berthed at the 16th Pier. The ships Fulong, Xin Ningshao, and Yongxing were the most crowded. The other ships stopped selling tickets in the morning, and there were few passengers.</p>
<h3>Two Chinese Ships Going from Shanghai to Ningbo</h3>
<p>Forcibly Returned by Japanese Troops in Chuansha</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, two Chinese merchant ships of the Chinese Merchant Steamship Company, which were sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo, were suddenly stopped by two Japanese warships when they reached Laohuwa in Chuansha. The ships were prevented from sailing and were monitored. The two Chinese ships, having lost their freedom, anchored in the river. Then, several Japanese soldiers in civilian clothes boarded the Nanhua ship and forcibly escorted it back to Shanghai. It is heard that the Japanese action was to prevent outside attention when the soldiers in civilian clothes landed ashore.</p>
<h3>The Repercussions of the Gaoqiao Ferry Service Suspension</h3>
<p>Commercial ferries continue to operate as usual.</p>
<p>Public anxiety escalates, leading to widespread evacuation.</p>
<p>Following the suspension of the Gaoqiao ferry service, travel became inconvenient, and public anxiety increased. Yesterday, Xu Junzuoxun and others sent a letter to the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association stating: "Since the Japanese aggression and the outbreak of war in Shanghai, it is unexpected that the Shanghai Municipal Council's ferry service would suddenly shorten its route, only reaching Donggou. The Gaoqiao terminal, the final stop, has been completely discontinued and neglected. Amidst the public anxiety, the public, seeing this public ferry service still suspended, feel even more bewildered and helpless. The panic of continuous evacuation is intensifying. The Shanghai Municipal Council's ferry service, being a public utility, should prioritize the convenience of citizens traveling to and from Pudong and Puxi, and should not be driven by profit. During this turbulent time, it should add extra shifts and reduce fares in addition to the regular schedule, providing disaster relief and comforting the wounded to stabilize public sentiment. Moreover, there are no obstacles whatsoever on the Shanghai-to-Gaoqiao route. Commercial ferries operated by Tongji and other companies are operating as usual, and even extending to Wusong to aid refugees. The Municipal Council, however, has suspended its service, disrupting transportation and agitating the public. The people not only do not benefit from it, but also suffer from it. The handling of this matter is rather perverse. Therefore, we specially request your association to promptly raise this question. If the Municipal Council does not provide a satisfactory response, please take decisive action to caution those who disturb public peace. We believe that your association, with its aim of protecting the welfare of fellow villagers, will surely grant our request."</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Service is Good</h3>
<p>Travel agencies send personnel to inquire.</p>
<p>At the China Travel Agency (new address at 8 Immortals Bridge, YMCA), in order to understand the train service situation on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line and the situation at the South Station, so as to inform refugees going to Hangzhou, Zou was sent to the South Station to conduct an on-site inquiry. He noted that at the intersection of Qiaohua and the French Concession, there were over two hundred refugees bound for Hangzhou and forty to fifty rickshaws. All were blocked by iron gates, waiting until 7:00 AM when the gates were opened before they could pass through. At 7:10 AM, he arrived at the station and saw a sea of people in front of the ticket windows, crowded and impassable. The ticket clerks were extremely busy. The station, to avoid crowding, opened another window specifically for selling third-class tickets to Hangzhou. Walking onto the platform, he saw the first train already parked next to the middle platform. Passengers who had already purchased tickets had to cross the railroad tracks to board the train, which seemed unsafe. Also, some passengers without tickets were going down the overpass to board the train on the middle platform, because there were no ticket inspectors there. He met with Station Master Zhou Fusheng at the station master's office and inquired about the train service situation. According to the response: the first train departs at 8:15 AM, the second at 9:45 AM, and the third at 3:00 PM. These three trains, if there are no unexpected events, are expected to run on time. There are also two temporary special trains, but they are not very reliable as they depend on whether Hangzhou Station sends them. Regarding the train situation, each train has about seven or eight third-class cars and one each of first and second class. After completing his inquiry, Zou returned to the agency at 8:00 AM to report to the staff of the car affairs department, so that they could inform ticket buyers at any time. Furthermore, to facilitate passengers, the agency will not close during the Spring Festival holiday period, but will continue to sell Shanghai-Hangzhou train tickets as usual. The ticket price is the same as at the station, and the ticket is valid for one day on the date printed on the ticket, regardless of the train. However, changing the date requires the station master's signature and permission.</p>
<h3>The Rain and Snow in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has turned cold in recent days. Yesterday, around 10:00 AM, it suddenly rained, and then snowflakes began to fall. After an hour, the rain and snow stopped, but the climate still felt very cold. Around 1:00 PM, light rain fell again, continuing until 4:00 PM in the evening. The rain was mixed with snowflakes. There were few pedestrians on the streets in the Nanshi area, and the scene was extremely quiet. However, the Chinese merchant trams and the Shanghai South Public Bus continued to operate as usual. At 5:00 PM, due to the curfew, they all successively returned to the factory early.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Still Attempting to Operate</h3>
<p>Drastic fare reductions on the Yangtze River route</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, Japanese ships have practically disappeared. Although they are trying to make a comeback, they are greatly affected by the current situation and the deep anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese people, making it very difficult to maintain operations. Recently, the Qing Company's ships are still trying to operate on the Yangtze River route, drastically reducing fares to attract customers. At the same time, they are also using deceptive tactics, uniformly painting the white smokestacks of the company's ships yellow, and replacing the Japanese characters on the ship's body with English characters, pretending to be merchant ships from the United States and Britain.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Situation of Japanese Women and Children Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reduced to eating rice twice a day.</p>
<p>Rice is sprinkled with salt and there are no dishes.</p>
<p>Women and children resent the government's warmongering.</p>
<p>They all cried bitterly when leaving Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Japanese merchant ship Kinryo Maru, on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, was fully loaded with hundreds of Japanese women and children, as well as a large amount of luggage, intending to sail back to Japan. However, it was blocked by the Wusong war and anchored in the Huangpu River for two days and nights before finally setting sail yesterday morning. According to a Chinese sailor Chen on the ship, he secretly left the ship and went ashore the night before. The food supplies for the Japanese women and children on the ship were all sent from the Japanese warships. They are reduced to eating rice twice a day, without any dishes to accompany it. The rice is only slightly sprinkled with salt. Every night at 7:00 PM, one or two Japanese propagandists come to the ship to give lectures, detailing the current war situation and the situation of the country, as well as reporting the number of Japanese soldiers and civilians who died in Shanghai in a single day, ranging from one or two hundred to three or four hundred. They instruct all the women and children on the ship to stand up silently for three minutes to express their condolences. Although all the women and children are forced by orders, they all resent their government's unwarranted warmongering, claiming to protect the overseas Chinese, but instead making the lives and deaths of the overseas Chinese uncertain. They all cried bitterly when leaving Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Two Fires in Hongkou</h3>
<p>A building at No. 13 Huade Road East and Yade Road was burned down around 12:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Chen Jiageng's branch store at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Wuchang Road also showed signs of burning around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 7th. In both cases, the Hongkou Fire Brigade arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm and extinguished the fire.</p>
<h3>The Fate of Overseas Chinese in Mexico is Full of Tribulations</h3>
<p>First oppressed by Mexicans and forced to leave the country</p>
<p>Then mistaken for Japanese in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the anti-Chinese wave in Mexico last autumn, all overseas Chinese in Mexico were forced to leave the country. Zhao Jiangong (51 years old, from Lushun, went to Mexico in 1907), Liu Gui (46 years old, from Kaiyuan County, Fengtian, went to Mexico in 1907), Liu Wenyu (52 years old, from Kaiyuan, went to Mexico in 1907), and Jiao Liqi (57 years old, from Kaiyuan, went to Mexico in 1900) were all miners in Mexico. When the anti-Chinese wave began, they were rescued by Americans and stayed in the United States for several months. On January 15th of this year, they were sent back to China on the American merchant ship Da Lai. On the 4th of this month, they arrived in Shanghai and immediately stayed at the Jiangzhe Hotel on Sanma Road in the Public Concession. At that time, the war in Zhabei was very intense, and the four were penniless. They were evicted by the hotel owner. The four had no choice but to carry their worn-out quilts on their shoulders and walk in the snow to Ningbo Road in the French Concession, wandering on the roadside. The four were all short, pale, and wearing Western suits, speaking imperfect Chinese. They were spotted by passersby and mistaken for enemy spies. Many people gathered around, intending to beat them severely. Fortunately, nearby police officers noticed it and immediately reported it to the police station, which dispatched several detectives to suppress it. The four were taken to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, it was revealed that they were overseas Chinese workers who had stayed in Mexico. At that time, Cheng Ziqing, the superintendent of the political department of the French police station, happened to be on the side. He felt sympathy for them and tried to find a way to help. Finally, with the permission of Zhao Pinsan, the chairman of the Shandong Association, they were allowed to stay there temporarily.</p>

<h3>Major Domestic and International News</h3>
<h3>US to Discuss Second Proposal with Powers</h3>
<p>London Sunday newspapers still pay close attention to the situation developing between China and Japan. Today, the Observer's New York dispatch states that the United States is currently discussing a second peace proposal with the powers. Once Japan's explanation regarding the continued dispatch of troops to Shanghai is received, it can be finalized. The Observer claims that the Japanese government's dispatch of troops to invade Chinese land outside the Shanghai concessions is indeed wrong. This is clearly an act of violating the League of Nations charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and a foolish challenge to the international interests concentrated in Shanghai. It is hoped that Japan's perverse behavior is temporary. If the British Foreign Secretary Simon's statement that Anglo-American friendly intervention is showing signs of good effect is true, then it is very welcome. Today's Sunday Public Review editorial advocates that the League of Nations powers take joint action to stop Japanese aggression. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is heard that France does not intend to continue negotiations with Japan for the time being. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Calls for Sanctions Against Brutal Japan</h3>
<p>London - Labour Party leader Lansbury told the press today that the British Labour Party is deeply angered by Japan's brutality in China. Governments should take actions that the powers can agree on to eliminate the intolerable and illegal situation in China. Japan insults the League of Nations and treats treaties as waste paper. Regardless of the commercial or financial sacrifices, all countries in the world must take action. This action may not necessarily lead to war, because Japan knows that the civilized world cannot tolerate such illegal acts and will not continue them without protest, and will not dare to sacrifice its entire commercial future. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>US Government Temporarily Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Butler Discusses the Future of China and Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Stimson stated today that regarding the Shanghai incident, there may not be any further diplomatic action before next week. The US government will temporarily adopt a closely wait-and-see attitude in the coming days. Also, Rear Admiral Blythe, the commander-in-chief of the Navy, stated that the US plan to reorganize the Asian Fleet has been postponed due to the Shanghai incident. According to the US Navy Department, it originally intended to withdraw six destroyers, six submarines, and one seaplane tender from the Asian Fleet. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Butler (retired), known for his outspokenness, who commanded the US Marine Corps in China in 1927, expressed his views here today, saying that even if Japan obtains Shanghai, trade north of the Yangtze River will not be of much value in the future. He also said that he believes Japan wants to seize everything north of the Yellow River, because the Japanese are determined to open up land. But he anticipates that the Chinese and Japanese nations will wage incessant wars for the next two hundred years. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Holds Secret Meeting</h3>
<p>Chinese Delegation Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting today. Chinese and Japanese representatives were absent. Participants believed that the steps currently being taken by the powers had not yet been completed, so it was decided that it was not appropriate to publicly debate the points of contention between China and Japan at this time. The Chinese delegation issued a statement stating that the reason why the Chinese representative did not make any statements to the Administrative Council today was that it learned that the Shanghai Investigation Team's report had not yet been received, and that several important members of the Administrative Council had indicated that it would be best to suspend the debate when negotiations were in progress and the situation was extremely complex. The chairman of the Shanghai University Federation telegraphed Geneva, stating that since January 28, the Japanese have continued their brutal attacks on innocent people and their aerial bombardment of undefended residents in China. The Commercial Press library, the Oriental Library, the Guangdong Merchants Hospital, and many churches and schools have been burned down. Priests and students have also been detained. The servant of Zhizhi University was killed, and the school buildings were killed. In the name of public justice and humanity, we call for an end to the destructive acts of the Japanese. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Receives Report from Shanghai Consular Corps</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The report of the Shanghai Consular Investigation Team is now in the hands of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. However, the Secretary-General believes that if the meaning of Article 15 of the Covenant is faithfully interpreted, this report should not be presented to the Administrative Council in its entirety or handed over to the press, but should be retained by the Secretary-General as personal material for examination, and only its usable parts, together with other news, should be reported to the Administrative Council. However, within the Administrative Council, it is believed that this interpretation is inappropriate. In general, it is believed that since the Consular Investigation Team's report has arrived, the Administrative Council will soon request China and Japan to provide a complete explanation of the facts that led to the Article 15 procedure. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>US Opposes International Police Proposal</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US State Department did not comment on France's proposal for an international police force, only stating that it was prepared to study all suggestions. However, other parties showed little support, saying that although France wants to implement its long-held concept in a reasonable way, its plan seems difficult to realize, especially for the United States. This is because France's proposal is closely linked to the concept of a guarantee treaty, and the US delegation has been instructed to reject the guarantee treaty, regardless of its form. The expression of Congress is even more explicit. The Foreign Affairs Committee almost unanimously opposed it, saying that Congress would never allow the use of American troops to participate in a world police force, partly because public opinion opposes the United States participating in all interventions, and partly because it does not want to lose the powers conferred by the Constitution. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Ding Chao Persistently Resists Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Defend Harbin Main Railway Station</p>
<p>(Shenyang) After occupying Harbin, the Japanese military commander sent troops to set up a sentry line around the city. Ding Chao, who persistently resists Japan, has now gone to Hulan. General Ma Zhanshan is still in Hailun. Passenger trains on the southern section of the China Eastern Railway, which travel between Changchun and Harbin, have resumed normal operation yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Westbound traffic currently only reaches Anda Town. It is heard that Japanese soldiers and Ding Chao's troops are fighting northeast of Qiqihar. Ding's troops and Xi Qia's troops have had several conflicts north of Harbin. Ding's troops passed through Harbin and retreated without any violence. Xi Qia's troops have not yet arrived here. Fresh Japanese troops arrived in Harbin by train and are now defending the Harbin main railway station. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Reinforce Datong Line with a Brigade</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shanhaiguan at 8:20 PM on the 6th stated that the Japanese troops on the Datong Line, due to heavy casualties, increased the deployment of cavalry artillery units and armored vehicles from the Dahu Mountain area on the morning of the 6th to provide support. They engaged in fierce battles with the volunteers all day. More than a hundred Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin arrived at Yuguan on the 5th and transported two cars of military supplies to the storage area of the Japanese barracks. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Fifty-five fully armed Japanese soldiers stationed in Tianjin boarded the Hatsuto Maru for Tanggu at 3:00 PM on the 7th. Another nineteen went to Shanhaiguan. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Tensions Rise in Tianjin After Japanese Military Police Provocation</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Lodges Protest with City Government</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the evening of the 6th, Japanese soldiers surrounded the headquarters of the Third Security Team in the Guangdong Guild Hall in the city. Sanpu, a staff officer, wrote a document in Japanese and forced Captain Li to sign it. The gist of it was that the security team had injured Japanese soldiers for no reason. Captain Li refused to sign. All the Japanese soldiers were preparing to take action, and the situation was serious. Governor Wang and Mayor Zhou, fearing a major incident, both advocated settling the matter peacefully. Zhou personally went to mediate, saying that if there were any problems, they could be discussed at length. The Japanese soldiers then lifted the siege. At 8:30 PM, Commander Kashiwai held an emergency meeting at the Public Hall. The consul-general, deputy consul-general, military police commander, police chief, representatives of the resident corps, and staff officers were present. The meeting did not end until midnight. The content is unknown. The Japanese consul lodged a protest with the city government at noon on the 7th. The content was not limited to punishing the perpetrators, apologizing, and paying compensation. According to Wang Yimin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Japanese soldiers ran into the city to bully the security team. I did not argue with them because they were unreasonable, so I disarmed them. The Japanese soldiers then inflicted injuries on themselves and forced me to sign. I am absolutely unwilling to suffer this humiliation. I know very well that there are fewer than a thousand Japanese soldiers in Tianjin, and including the reservists, there are no more than two thousand. They are definitely no match for the city's security team. If Japan wants to occupy Tianjin, it must send in a large army. The sabers are drawn at each other, but it is just empty threats. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Northeast Armored Vehicle Teams Ordered to Train in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Empty cars on the Beining Railway are now ordered to concentrate in Fengtai. Northeast armored vehicle teams are also ordered to train in Beiping.

<h3>Commanders from Various Places Unanimously Vow to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) Commanders from various places responded to Chiang Kai-shek's telegram and pledged to unanimously resist Japan. The telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>Han Fuqu's telegram to Nanjing, respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: I have received your telegram. The brutality of the Japanese is appalling and inhumane. The central government has been trying to navigate the situation with restraint, but they are taking advantage of this. Fuqu, as a soldier, has an unwavering duty to protect the country and its people. I will follow the footsteps of my predecessors, united in our hatred of the enemy. I am willing to sacrifice my life and limbs without hesitation. Fortunately, Commander-in-Chief Chiang is fighting valiantly in Shanghai, which is enough to assert our prestige and protect the nation's status. Fuqu will only abide by your instructions, encourage my subordinates, and prepare to sacrifice myself to fulfill my duty and maintain the nation's destiny. The general trend is that if we are to fight, we will be forced to fight. Therefore, whether we fight or not is beyond our control. We can only do our best to fight the wolves with our blood and flesh wherever they may attack. I submit this telegram with tears. I implore you to consider it. I am Han Fuqu.</p>
<p>Liu Zhennian's telegram to Nanjing, respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: I have respectfully received your telegram. The Japanese pirates are acting violently, attacking our borders, and are now becoming even more outrageous, running rampant in Shanghai. This is intolerable. Your Excellency's concern for the national crisis and your impassioned words have inspired all Chinese. I will follow Your Excellency's leadership and vow to lead my troops to fight the Japanese invaders with our blood. I have ordered my subordinates to be on standby to defend our territory. I hope to live up to Your Excellency's earnest instructions and fulfill my duty as a revolutionary soldier. I respectfully reply by telegram. I implore you to consider it. I am Liu Zhennian.</p>
<p>Lu Diping's telegram to Nanjing, respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Committee: I have respectfully received your telegram. The Japanese pirates have invaded the Northeast, followed by Rehe. Tianjin and Beiping are in danger. The Chinese people have endured hardship with patience, quietly seeking a fair judgment from the League of Nations. However, the Japanese pirates disregard world justice, undermine peace in the Far East, move their troops south, and deploy them along the shores of Shanghai. All Chinese are furious. Fortunately, the banners of war are being brought forward, and the command is decisive. With someone in charge, and with united hatred for the enemy, the restoration of the nation is not far off. International justice has not been completely destroyed. Our nation's spirit is great. How can we sit idly by and allow the enemy to slaughter us? I vow to put on my armor, shoulder my weapons, avenge our grievances, and fight for the independence of the nation and the survival of our people. Diping will inspire my troops and fight to the death without hesitation. I respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration. I am Lu Diping, Commander of the Ninth Route Army.</p>
<p>He Jian et al.'s telegram to Luoyang, respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang: I have received your telegram. Your Excellency's call to arms has been met with cheers throughout the country. It is time for soldiers to repay their country. We have made all the necessary preparations and await your orders. We are He Jian, Liu Jianxu, Liu Yinggu, Wang Dongyuan, Peng Weiren, Li Jue, Tao Guang, Chen Guangzhong, Zhang Ying, and Chen Quzhen.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing: I have received your telegram about the central government's patient efforts and the Japanese provocations in Shanghai, and the greatest determination that soldiers should have in the future. I have read it repeatedly with deep emotion and vow to supervise my subordinates, await orders to kill the enemy and fight the Japanese invaders. I respectfully reply by telegram. I am Commander-in-Chief Sun Lianzhong. (6th)</p>

<h3>Beijing's Economic Situation is Desolate</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The tranquility of Nanjing during the Lunar New Year is unprecedented. There are no pedestrians on the roads, and vehicles are rarely seen. In previous years, the sound of firecrackers filled the air, but now there is silence. The entire city is covered in white snow, which is gradually increasing. Tourists are absent from Zhongshan Road, and all entertainment venues in the city are closed. The scene is almost the same as after Beiping moved the capital in previous years. In the past, when incidents occurred in China, only wealthy families moved away. Poor people either lacked funds or knew that their homes were bare and did not fear robbery, so they were at ease. This time, however, it is very different from before. The poor people fled first. Today, it is almost impossible to find a barber, because they have all fled. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Xuexi'er Discusses Disarmament</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Berlin Daily News published an article by Lord Xuexi'er on the disarmament conference. Mr. Xuexi'er classified military equipment into two types: offensive and defensive, believing there is a clear distinction. He also mentioned that French Prime Minister Laval once said that a country's military strength is closely related to its security, which Mr. Xuexi'er believes is true. Mr. Xuexi'er believes that various offensive military equipment, such as bombers, tanks, heavy artillery, battlecruisers, battleships, and submarines, if completely abolished, cooperation among countries to maintain international order will be easier to organize. This is the first step. The second step should be to eliminate various military preparations and establish an international monitoring system. The final step should be to regulate the military budgets of various countries to prevent them from exceeding a certain amount. Mr. Xuexi'er concluded by saying that it is time for the people of all countries to take the issue of disarmament as their own responsibility. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>

<h3>Garrison in Vladivostok Strictly Prevents White Russian Activities</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the news of Soviet Russian troops stationed in Vladivostok is not credible, according to the report of the Japanese Consul-General in that port to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian authorities in Vladivostok are currently arresting a large number of White Russians. Because the prisons are full, they are all being exiled to other places. It is also said that the military and horses have been very busy recently, and they often transport bullets, giving the appearance of wartime. However, this activity is purely a plan to prevent White Russians and does not involve the issue of stationing troops. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>A telegram from Hangzhou addressed to the Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai: Jingri has invaded our Northeast and disturbed our Songhu. With the defenses dismantled and our houses in imminent danger, our central government, in order to respond to emergencies and effect changes, has resolutely moved its office to Luoyang to make plans for a sustained resistance. Looking at history and considering the facts, this is truly an unprecedentedly difficult and dangerous situation, and also the linchpin of the rise and fall of the nation. All comrades and compatriots across the country should be of one heart and one mind, and jointly plan for a perfect solution. You, as members of the Central Committee, and many of you also holding important government positions, have an inescapable responsibility to support the tottering and save the endangered. Except for those serving in local positions and those with special tasks in Shanghai, you should promptly go to Beijing and Luoyang to provide guidance and lead, coordinate the overall situation, so that the central government can be consolidated, appease the people's expectations, and correct international perceptions. The depth of the crisis is urgent, and a slight delay will lead to loss. It is neither a time to be aloof and boast of nobility, nor a place for hesitation and indecision. You care about the party and the country, and you will surely be able to adopt even the smallest suggestions. We send this telegram with our earnest request, hoping you will give it your consideration. The Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang respectfully bows.</p>

<h3>Ding and Li Unite to Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Passage of Li Du's Troops into Harbin</p>
<p>Yu Shencheng Aids the Enemy in Reconnoitering Harbin</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin: On the morning of January 26th, the 24th Brigade of the Jilin Army, led by Li Du, and the Chen Dongshan Regiment, together with the Feng Zhanhai Division of the 682nd Regiment, suddenly entered Daowai, Harbin, and occupied the Binjiang County Public Security Bureau and the Binjiang Garrison Commander's Office. They united with Ding Chao, commander of the 28th Brigade, and Xing Zhanqing, commander of the 26th Brigade, to unanimously resist Xi Qia. This morning (27th), fierce fighting has broken out at Taipingqiao and Sankeshu (15 miles from Harbin) in eastern Harbin. As a result, Xi Qia's army was defeated. The details of Li and Feng's troops entering the city are recorded below.</p>
<p>Yu Shencheng Forced Ding Chao, Feng Zhanhai, and Gong Ziliang of the Jilin Army to Withdraw from Acheng. A regiment of Yu Shencheng's troops under Xi Qia's command immediately entered. At this time, Xi Qia, believing that this army had won consecutive victories, intended to resolve Ding Chao and Na Zhanqing. He telegraphed Ding and Xing, ordering them to hand over military power, and their troops to be received by regimental commanders under his command. At the same time, he telegraphed and appointed Bai Shoucai, commander of the 676th Regiment of the 28th Brigade, to replace Ding as brigade commander, and Song Wenjun, commander of the 673rd Regiment, to replace Xing Zhanqing as brigade commander. The two divisions were to proceed to Yimianpo, Hengdaohé, and set up camp, awaiting reorganization. Xing Zhanqing, unable to resist, handed over the seal on the 25th, which was received by Song Wenjun to replace him. Ding Chao also stepped down on the 26th, and the positions he held concurrently as Commander of the Eastern Railway Protection Army and Commander of the Changsui Railway Protection were received by representatives appointed by Yu Shencheng. Binjiang Garrison Commander was taken over by Ma Xilin. All were scheduled to be handed over on the 26th. This matter was inconsistent with the conditions for mediation between Zhang Jinghui and the two sides, and it was beyond the巧电expressed by Ding Chao and others. Ding and others were quite indignant. At the same time, Yu Shencheng telegraphed Ding Chao, giving him three days to vacate his residence (Ding's residence was an official residence (so that his family could move in. At this time, in addition to派金武宣 and 汤武涉 to succeed the director of the Harbin Electricity Bureau and the director of the Binjiang Public Security Bureau, Xi Qia also派齐和政 to take over the director of the Special Police Management Office,马某 to take over the director of the Telephone Bureau, and 赵维桢 吴阁臣 王之魁 陈驷兴 and others to take over important agencies in the Binjiang Special District. The Special District was originally under the scope of Zhang Jinghui, and Xi Qia now wants to annex it all, so Zhang Jinghui is also dissatisfied. At twelve o'clock in the evening on the 25th, Li Du, the garrison commander of Yilan, sent personnel to Harbin to cooperate with the representatives of Feng Zhanhai to meet with Ding Chao, Xing Zhanqing, Zhang Jinghui and others at Zhang Jinghui's mansion. At the time, Ma Zhanshan heard the news and also派 representatives to join. Li Du's representative asked Ding Chao if there was a solution. Ding said that things have reached this point and the troops are no longer under his command. He is empty-handed and has no way to resist but to hand over his position. Zhang Jinghui said that no matter what, he would explain to Xi Qia again, and a peaceful understanding was the best. Other people's opinions were divided. The meeting adjourned at two o'clock in the morning on the 26th. Representatives of Li Du, Feng Zhanhai, and Ma Zhanshan telegraphed their officials. At three o'clock in the morning on the 26th, Li Du received a message from Yilan and immediately ordered Chen Dongshan's division and the cavalry battalion stationed in Binzhou to depart for Harbin first. Three battalions of infantry set off from Yilan in long-distance buses. Feng Zhanhai's division bypassed the Eastern Railway from Ercedianzi and also advanced towards Harbin. The army moved extremely fast. At eight o'clock in the morning on the 26th, the machine gun company of the vanguard team of Feng's division entered Daowai, Harbin, in large trucks and drove straight to Zhengyang Street and the Binjiang Public Security Bureau. At the time, the citizens still suspected that it was Yu Shencheng's army entering, and the merchants who had just opened their shutters were panicked and closed their doors. For a time, the streets were in chaos.</p>
<p>The Fake Public Security Director is Arrested. When the large trucks arrived in front of the Public Security Bureau, the soldiers jumped off the trucks and rushed into the bureau. The guard tried to stop them and was shot dead. Three police chiefs, including Zhang Yingjie, and the security captain, Nie Changqing, who came out to scold them, were also shot dead. The soldiers rushed into the main hall. At that time, the public servants had not yet arrived. The soldiers searched in the rooms for a long time and found Tang Wushe, the fake public security director appointed by Xi Qia, on the upper floor, and arrested him. Tang tried to struggle and escape and was shot and wounded in his left arm. From this point on, the people in the bureau did not dare to go. At 8:50, most of Feng's division entered the street, and a few selected members of Chen Dongshan's division also entered the street and were deployed at the street corners. Mortars and machine guns were set up on Zhengyang Street and Mugu Street. The police guns and equipment in various bureaus were confiscated and monitored by the army. The situation was extremely tense. At about nine o'clock, Li Du arrived with Chen Dongshan, the regimental commander, and entered the Binjiang Garrison Commander's Office. Soon after, Feng Zhanhai arrived with his battalion commander Xu Xinqian. He invited Ding Chao to ask him what his attitude was. If he did not resist and handed over the powers of the Garrison Commander and the Commander of the 28th Brigade, he would ask him to hand them over to Zao and Feng Zhanhai. Ding replied that he did not care about handing over, but his troops were scattered abroad. Only one regiment of Bai Shoucai stationed in Harbin was no longer obeying orders. Li and Feng said that if that was the only reason, they would help resolve the problem of Bai's regiment first, and then confront Xi Qia to the end. Ding expressed his approval, so they decided to act together. Ding and Li feared that the people would be panicked, so they issued a joint announcement saying, "To announce, since the incident, the Jilin army has always been dedicated to protecting the country and loving the people, and upholding the principle of friendly relations with foreign countries. It has been tirelessly protecting the local security and foreign nationals. However, recently there has been Yu Shencheng, who has recruited bandits and disrupted the local area, and has even made his party members seize important agencies in Harbin and disrupt the order, so that the army's months of hard work in maintaining Harbin has been in vain. Now, armies from all over the Northeast have risen up to fight against the bandits, sincerely loving the Special District Commissioner and protecting the foreign merchants with extra care. There will be no disturbance in the places passed by. We ask our merchants and foreign nationals to live in peace and not to be alarmed. This is the announcement. Binjiang Garrison Commander Ding Chao, Yilan Garrison Commander Li Du, January 26th, 21st year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Zhang Jinghui Telegraphed to Jilin for Mediation At 2:00 p.m. on the 26th, the foreign consuls stationed in Harbin held a meeting at the US Consulate. As a result, the US Consul Johnson went to see Zhang Jinghui at the Commissioner's Office and asked him to pay attention to the safety of the侨民. Zhang agreed to convey this to Commanders Ding and Li and was determined to find ways to protect them. Then, Zhang invited Ding, Li, Xing, Feng, and Jin Wuxuan, Xi Qia's representative in Harbin, to a meeting at his private residence. At that time, Tufihara, the newly appointed director of the Harbin Special Affairs Agency of Japan, also asked to participate with the qualifications of a mediator. Zhang could not refuse. At the meeting, Zhang said that Harbin was an international city and should not be used for combat. If you insist on resisting against Jilin, you may as well fight outside the city. The troops should withdraw from the city to avoid the suffering of the residents and the protests of the foreign consuls. If the armies can retreat, I will negotiate with Xi Qia for a peaceful solution. Zhang also said that he had already sent a telegram to Xi Qia asking him to stop Yu's army from advancing. Ding and Xing were still asked to maintain the road protection and local security in Harbin. Li Du said that Xi Qia was cruel and poisonous and could not compromise with him.叙帅 (Zhang Jinghui) is now under his control. If he does not repent, we will solve his problem and then solve the special zone. After discussion, it was decided that the 28th Brigade would still be led by Ding Chao. Bai Shoucai, who was appointed by Xi Qia to be promoted to regimental commander, would be dismissed immediately. Xing Zhanqing would return to his position as commander of the 26th Brigade, and Song Wenjun would return to his position as regimental commander. The troops, except for those stationed in the official stores in the city, would move to the suburbs of Harbin and be stationed in Wangzhaotun, Tianjiashaoguo, Sankeshu, Zuo Pingqiao, and other places. If there is a peaceful solution, there will be no problem. Otherwise, the limit of ten miles outside Harbin will be the limit of the war. At about 4 o'clock, when the meeting was about to end, Xi Qia sent a telegram to Zhang Jinghui, asking him to forward it to Ding and Li, saying that he had telegraphed Yu Shencheng to stop advancing to Harbin, and that Ding and Xing were still asked to maintain the road protection and local security in Harbin. Therefore, Li Du and Feng Zhanhai's army decided to open Daowai at 4:30 and stationed in the nearby suburbs. At 6:00 p.m., the Zhao regiment of Su Dechen's 22nd Brigade arrived at Tianjiashaoguo from the Sanchahe area. The regiment of Chang Yaochen's 7th Cavalry Brigade stationed in Fuyu and Gong Shazi's volunteer army also arrived separately at Guxiangtun Huangshan Zuizi and other places. Thus, the whole of Harbin was surrounded by troops. When the Commissioner's Office was in session, a Japanese plane came to Harbin Daowai to侦察 and distribute leaflets from Yu Shencheng, urging Li and Feng to surrender. The plane flew very high and did not fly away until 2:40.</p>
<p>Fighting Has Already Occurred in the Suburbs of Harbin At 9:00 this morning (27th), a Japanese plane came to the port to侦察 first. At 10:15, Yu Shencheng's army was discovered at Sankeshu and Taipingqiao in the east of the port. Li Du immediately派 troops to resist. Machine gun fire was heard in the port, like firecrackers, interspersed with the roar of artillery. It was reported that about one division of Yu's army came from the direction of Acheng and took the area of Taipingqiao Huangshan Zuizi in the east of the port. Therefore, the gunfire in that area was more frequent. The armored vehicles of the 28th Brigade drove to Tianjiashaoguo from Yimianpo this afternoon, together with Feng's regiment, to guard the area. However, most of Yu's army has not yet arrived, and a thorough battle may be tonight or tomorrow morning. Li Du and others are determined to resist because their survival depends on it.
