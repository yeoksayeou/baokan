<p>時評</p>
<h3>募集禦侮公債彬</h3>
<p>我民族今已處於生死綫上。目前之事。一言而决。惟抗禦乃能圖存。退讓即爲自殺。故吾人今日。惟有以絕大之决心。爭取我民族一絲僅屬之生命。自上海禍變爆發。我十九路軍英勇抗禦以來。雖每戰皆捷。使日軍志無由逞。然而應援之日軍。正源源而來。上海之情勢。仍甚嚴重。而且東北大地。尚陷敵手。滿蒙獨立。亦正積極進行。故吾人今日。惟有以一致之團結。準備持久之抗爭。乃能奪取我民族之生存自由。</p>
<p>論者有謂我國今日民窮財盡。百不如人。而又適逢大水之後。江南河北。荒凉一片。决無法再負擔與日軍持久抗爭之軍費。是誠然矣。然而否否。蓋我民族今日已處於最嚴重之地位。非竭盡全力。持久抗爭。决不足以遏止落暉返照之日軍暴行。故我國今日。亟應發行禦侮公債。以供應抗暴禦侮必不可少之軍費。</p>
<p>誠然。我國家今已民窮財盡。凋敝不堪。而且以政治當局。歷次假編遣裁兵善後賑災之名。發行公債。搜刮民財。以擴充其實力。早已不足以。取信於人民。然而處於進攻地位之日本。今日固亦已凋殘不堪。末可如何據統計其國債。早已達六十八億八千萬元之鉅。平均每人負擔爲一百零六元。自不景氣普遍世界以來。日本經濟已陷於危險萬分之境。昭和七年度預算額。竭力節縮。爲十三億元。而收入竟不敷一億二千萬元。尤其自去年東北禍變突發以後。動員軍隊十萬餘人。籌募軍費數萬萬元。更深感無法應付。一月份之軍費且由日皇墊出。最近上海禍變發生。又需臨時發行公債四千萬元。其財政之竭蹶。經濟。之凋敝。已可槪見。而據吾國財政部統計。我内外國債總計不過五十五億元。以全國人口計。每人約負擔十四元弱之數。較之日本相差甚鉅。彼以侵略。尙不惜發行公債。我爲自衛。詎容坐侍宰割。而不竭全力以維民族之生存。假使此次發行公債二萬萬元。能專爲禦侮。作一通艦久遠供應之整個計劃。絕不移作他用。則吾人可斷言國内一般人士。以及海外華僑。必可踴躍應募。視此次上海禍變爆發以來。各方面捐輸之熱烈。蓋可深信我國人决不惜竭盡其全力以共赴國難也。</p>
<p>獨是過去發行公債。財政當局與少數短視之金融家。大都互相勾。結各爲其本身利益而打算。不惜犧牲人民之血汗。以延長内亂。故此次之禦侮公債。必由我人民職業團體主持。愼重保管。公允支配。庶幾不至再蹈前此之覆轍。日前西報亦有此項建議。吾人敢舉此意見以貢諸我全國國民。</p>
<p>上海事件</p>
<h3>中日大戰卽將爆發</h3>
<p>日本陸軍到齊準備進攻</p>
<p>我軍士氣奮發决心抵抗</p>
<p>今晨將有劇戰</p>
<h3>日艦七艘向吳淞出動</h3>
<p>據今晨川沙方面消息、駐泊白龍港之日艦七艘燈光齊明、升火待發、即將向吳淞出動、同時日陸軍援軍一師團、昨日已全部開到、以砲兵爲最多、故預料今晨、吳淞閘北全線當有劇戰、</p>
<h3>吳淞昨日戰况</h3>
<p>敵軍偷渡又告失敗　　敵艦不斷砲轟淞鎭前晚吳淞曹家橋之大捷、偷渡敵軍千餘名、全部殲滅、計奪獲來福槍·手提機關槍等戰利品無數、（請參閱本報攝影記者昨在吳淞所攝得之戰利品攝影）敵經此重創後、猶不甘心、昨晨一時許、復派大隊企圖偷渡先後均經擊退、而吳淞口外之敵艦、亦不斷向淞鎭砲轟、昨晨拂曉敵由張家浜襲擊侯家木橋激戰數小時敵始潰退、各情分誌如次</p>
<h3>敵偷渡又失敗</h3>
<p>敵經曹家橋之大創後、猶不甘心、復於昨晨一時許派大隊敵兵至曹家橋、希圖在重砲掩護之下、再行偷渡蕰藻浜、我軍乘新勝之餘士氣振奮當即渡河聯合、在紀家橋東唐家橋方面之我軍、向敵軍挺進雙方激戰、至昨晨三時許敵兵不支、向後潰退、我軍遂將南泗塘河以西之原有陣地恢復、是役敵又死傷甚衆、</p>
<h3>昨晨並無激戰</h3>
<p>昨晨吳淞方面　　並無激戰、惟每隔三五分鐘敵開放大砲示威、我軍並不還擊、昨日上午八時至九時間、在淞口方面之敵艦、不斷向淞鎭開砲轟擊約有百餘彈之多、致鎭中東昇路文昌路一帶、有數處房屋起火、十時許、復有敵機六架、自口外洋面飛起、向蕰藻浜我軍陣地擲炸彈十餘枚、我軍無甚損傷、旋經我軍用高射砲、將敵機擊退、昨日下午二時前、雙方並無接觸、但敵機二架、仍不時往還高飛偵察、據在江灣東六里許之侯家木橋鄉間逃出之難民稱、該處及高境廟一帶已於前日上午起、發現不少敵兵、是可見在張華浜方面之敵軍、已將陣綫自紀家橋延長至侯家木橋高境廟等處、而與在江灣與閘北方面陣綫聯接矣、</p>
<h3>補記前日戰况</h3>
<p>敵軍欲斷我軍吳淞閘北之連絡、故决放棄海陸空軍猛襲吳淞之計劃、而改向吳淞江灣間戰綫、分三路猛衝、希圖有一處衝破、以截斷淞滬間連絡、而收圍攻或包抄吳淞之效、其進攻計劃、以呼應方法、分三路猛衝、一路自前晨拂曉五時許起、由蕰藻浜渡河襲曹家橋、一路由張華浜於七時許襲侯家木橋、另一路則於晚十時許、由殷翔路上端及體育會路夾攻引翔鄉萬國體育塲、此其分三路進犯情形也、</p>
<h3>敵襲侯家木橋</h3>
<p>敵軍於前晨由張華浜襲侯家木橋被、我擊退後、我軍陣綫、向前推進約三五里、但至前晚十時許、敵又以大隊大舉來襲、我軍當出而應戰相持歷三小時敵漸不支陸續增援、我軍亦調大部隊前往應戰敵、見我不調大部隊亦再增援皆係陸軍我軍、於清晨十時許、下令衝鋒、旋即重疊層前進、以致敵軍在西康家橋及鍾家宅附近、悉數被我包圍敵以手機關槍等向外衝突、我則以手溜彈向内抛擲、每一手溜彈爆炸後、可死傷敵人十數人、雙方激戰至數小時、敵不支敗退、</p>
<h3>敵軍殲滅經過</h3>
<p>敵軍於前日　　）十三（侵晨天陰雨雪之際、利用烟幕彈掩護、以二千餘人、在曹家橋架浮橋侵渡、圖窺我吳淞陣地乃爲我軍包圍、由上午七時至下午九時、雙方激戰至烈、據昨晨（十四）由吳淞來滬之某軍官述稱、敵軍初以四五百人、藉烟幕彈蔽護、在浜南紀家橋偷渡過河、即佔曹家橋、其後陸續偷渡者、復有千餘人、將我軍防綫衝破、施行强烈襲擊、是時我軍張旅已由後方趕到、率隊反攻、將敵三面包圍、肉搏數十次、敵抵死掙扎、屢欲突圍而出不遂、血戰至入夜十時許、始將渡河之敵全數殲滅、無一生還、戰鬥之猛烈、爲開戰以來所未有、蓋其間十二小時中、未停息一分鐘也、是役我軍傷亡亦達百餘人敵屍千餘具、現仍狼藉於曹家橋浜中、現曹家橋方面之敵、已完全肅清、敵受此重創後、以後必不敢向我正視矣、又云敵乘十二日雙方停戰四小時救護難民之際、竟違背國際信義在蕰藻浜南黃浦江邊、用大砲向我陣地轟擊、可謂無恥已極、但當時我軍爲嚴守信義計、絕未還擊云、</p>
<h3>鄉老持酒犒軍</h3>
<p>前晚敵軍偷渡蕰藻浜被我勇猛軍士、全部解决後本報記者、持於昨日前往調查一切、車行一小時、抵某地、該地除我防軍外、並駐有上海市民義勇軍、及華僑義勇軍數百人、紅十字會正在由戰地上用大卡車運救傷兵、道旁滿列三八式槍千餘枝、蓋自敵方奪獲之戰利品也、途經某寺、上海市民義勇軍正在積極訓練、未幾又遇華僑義勇軍隊長陳瑞　、對記者謂、該隊均係</p>
<p>自海外歸來、前晚戰事劇烈、該隊夜間均往運救傷兵、隊員均具有特種技術、如駕駛汽車、管理電信、修理機器等、對於軍事上將有不少貢獻、時記者急欲往前綫、汽車已不能通、蒙派隊員四人、携槍照料、捨車步行、行二十餘里、至某橋、遇見我軍團長廖起榮、及團附田子玉、前晚敵人偷渡即在該團防綫、前晚之役、敵人果已全部解决矣、但我軍不願進佔、以便待其再來、談至此、有鄉老夫婦兩人、持酒兩瓶、乾點數包來贈團長、謂昨晚辛苦了、今特奉送少許、聊以慶祝、團長固却、時適團中已開晚膳、老夫婦乃親爲開瓶、斟於杯中、團長邀余等同膳、膳後即由原道而回、乘車返滬、已萬家燈火時矣、</p>
<h3>閘北昨日戰况</h3>
<p>敵軍以飛機砲彈威脅</p>
<p>我軍收復江灣跑馬塲</p>
<p>閘北方面、雙方防線、昨（十四日）無變動、且亦並無接觸、以日兵連日傾注全力於吳淞之故、惟昨晨八時許、日飛機仍往閘北投彈、均爲我軍擊退、故頗安靜、下午三時許、日兵又復砲轟、我軍亦還擊、約半小時即停止、惟發砲次數甚稀、至晚未有戰事、我軍深悉敵軍兵力單薄、已有顧此失彼之象、乃乘蕰藻浜戰勝餘威、於昨晨七時、由江灣派兵五百餘名、向萬國體育會跑馬塲敵軍陣地進攻、敵軍初猶頑强抵抗、戰約一小時後、我軍改換陣勢分路向敵軍前後中三部猛攻、卒將敵軍擊散、但日兵尤國困鬥、乃爲我軍分部團擊、敵軍勢始不支、至由時三十分左右、敵兵已傷亡過半、退出佔據地、我軍即進據跑馬塲、此役日兵傷亡百餘名、我軍獲戰利品、野砲八尊、機關槍步槍及輜重品無數並搜獲敵軍重要文件數包、現我軍正向軍工路推進、截斷敵軍後路、分兵夾擊云、</p>
<p>駐滬中央委員電請</p>
<h3>當局迅速定計</h3>
<p>臚陳要點四項</p>
<p>孫科等通電云、（銜略）鑒、政密、比聞軍事外交當局、有主張滬事局部作先行解决之意、英使復有我國自動撤兵之勸、而當局認爲可商、同人在滬迭加研討、心所謂危、敢陳所見、溯自東北邊防司令長官張學良、誤於不抵抗之謬論、使日寇埀手遂得三省、而軍事當局亦慴於日兵聲威輒謂縱傾全國之兵、不足抗日、我與日戰三日可以亡國同人以爲此種心理、不特與總理遣敎主義完全違悖、充其弊、實足以亡黨亡國而有餘、非澈底掃除、决不足以衝破今日之危局也、蓋國家興衰、繫於人心振靡、戰鬥之事、兩方物質力量固所必衡、而士氣民心所關絕巨、精神方面有非數月能算者、世界革命鬥爭、若論被壓迫者所憑藉之武力、幾曾有一次足與壓迫者相頡頑、或可及其半者、苟咸如當局所謂持重、則世界可以無革命、而吾</p>

        <h1>1932.02.15</h1>
<h3>Recruiting Patriotic Bonds</h3>
<p>Our nation is now on the line between life and death. The current situation can be summarized in one sentence: resistance is the only way to survive, concession is suicide. Therefore, today, we must use the greatest determination to fight for the last shred of life for our nation. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, our 19th Route Army has bravely resisted the enemy, winning every battle and preventing the Japanese army from achieving its ambitions. However, reinforcements for the Japanese army are constantly arriving, and the situation in Shanghai is still very serious. Moreover, the vast land of the Northeast is still in enemy hands, and the independence of Manchuria and Mongolia is being actively promoted. Therefore, today, we must unite as one and prepare for a protracted struggle to seize the freedom to survive for our nation.</p>
<p>Some argue that our country is now impoverished and backward in every way, and that it has also suffered from severe floods, leaving Jiangnan and Hebei desolate. Therefore, we cannot afford the military expenses for a protracted struggle against the Japanese army. This is indeed true. But is it really so? Our nation is now in the most critical position. Only by exerting all our strength and persevering in the resistance can we stop the sunset-reflecting barbarity of the Japanese army. Therefore, our country must urgently issue patriotic bonds to provide the military expenses that are essential for resisting violence and defending against aggression.</p>
<p>Indeed, our country is now impoverished, devastated, and discredited by the authorities who have repeatedly issued bonds in the name of troop reduction, demobilization, post-disaster relief, and other pretexts to plunder the people's wealth and expand their power. However, Japan, which is in an attacking position, is also facing dire conditions. According to statistics, its national debt has already reached a staggering 6.88 billion yuan, with an average burden of 106 yuan per person. Since the global economic downturn, Japan's economy has been in a precarious state. The budget for the 7th year of Showa (1932) was drastically reduced to 1.3 billion yuan, but the revenue fell short by 120 million yuan. Especially since the sudden outbreak of the Northeast Incident last year, the mobilization of over 100,000 troops and the raising of tens of millions of yuan in military expenses have made it feel increasingly unable to cope. The military expenses for January were even covered by the Emperor's personal funds. The recent Shanghai Incident has required the temporary issuance of 40 million yuan in bonds. Its financial exhaustion and economic devastation are evident. According to statistics from our Ministry of Finance, our total internal and external debt is only 5.5 billion yuan, with each person bearing approximately 14 yuan, which is significantly less than Japan's burden. If they are willing to issue bonds for aggression, how can we sit and wait to be slaughtered for self-defense without exerting all our strength to maintain our nation's survival? If we issue 200 million yuan in bonds this time, and use it exclusively for defense, making a comprehensive plan for long-term supply, and never divert it for other purposes, then we can confidently assert that people across the country and overseas Chinese will enthusiastically subscribe. Based on the enthusiastic donations from all sectors since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, we can deeply believe that our people will not hesitate to exhaust all their strength to overcome the national crisis together.</p>
<p>However, in the past, the financial authorities and a small number of short-sighted financiers colluded with each other, seeking their own interests and sacrificing the people's blood and sweat to prolong the internal strife. Therefore, this patriotic bond must be managed by our people's professional organizations, carefully safeguarded, and fairly distributed, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Western newspapers have also made this suggestion recently. We dare to offer this opinion to our people across the country.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>The Sino-Japanese War is About to Erupt</h3>
<p>Japanese troops have arrived, ready to attack.</p>
<p>Our soldiers are in high spirits, determined to resist.</p>
<p>A major battle is expected this morning.</p>
<h3>Seven Japanese Warships Head Towards Wusong</h3>
<p>According to news from Chuansha this morning, seven Japanese warships anchored in Bailong Port had their lights on and were preparing to set sail, ready to head towards Wusong. At the same time, a full division of Japanese army reinforcements arrived yesterday, mostly artillery. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a major battle on the entire Wusong-Zhabei front this morning.</p>
<h3>Wusong Battlefield Yesterday</h3>
<p>The enemy's attempt to cross the river again failed. Enemy warships constantly bomb Wusong. The great victory at Caojia Bridge in Wusong the night before last resulted in the annihilation of more than a thousand enemy troops who attempted to cross the river. Countless trophies were seized, including rifles and submachine guns. (Please refer to the photograph of the trophies taken by our newspaper's photographer in Wusong yesterday.) After suffering this heavy blow, the enemy was still unwilling to give up. At around 1:00 AM yesterday, they sent another large force to attempt to cross the river, but they were repeatedly repelled. Enemy warships outside the mouth of Wusong also continuously bombarded Wusong. At dawn yesterday, the enemy launched an attack on Houjia Muqiao from Zhangjiabang, and after several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy collapsed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attempt to Cross the River Fails Again</h3>
<p>After suffering a major defeat at Caojia Bridge, the enemy was still unwilling to give up. At around 1:00 AM yesterday, they sent a large force of enemy troops to Caojia Bridge, hoping to cross the Yunzaobang River again under the cover of heavy artillery fire. Taking advantage of their recent victory, our troops were in high spirits and immediately crossed the river and joined forces with our troops in the area east of Jijiabao Bridge and Tangjiabao Bridge, advancing towards the enemy. Fierce fighting ensued, and at around 3:00 AM yesterday, the enemy troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. Our troops then recovered their original positions west of the Nansitang River. In this battle, the enemy suffered heavy casualties again.</p>
<h3>No Fierce Fighting Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>There was no fierce fighting in Wusong yesterday morning. However, the enemy fired artillery shells every three to five minutes as a show of force. Our troops did not return fire. From 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM yesterday morning, enemy warships at the mouth of Wusong continuously fired artillery shells at Wusong, firing more than a hundred shells, causing fires in several houses along Dongsheng Road and Wenchang Road in the town. At around 10:00 AM, six enemy aircraft took off from the sea outside the port and dropped more than ten bombs on our army's positions in Yunzaobang, causing little damage to our troops. The enemy aircraft were then driven back by our anti-aircraft guns. There was no contact between the two sides before 2:00 PM yesterday. However, two enemy aircraft continued to fly back and forth for reconnaissance. According to refugees who escaped from the Houjia Muqiao village about six li east of Jiangwan, a number of enemy troops had been discovered in the area around Houjia Muqiao and Gaojing Temple since the morning of the previous day. This shows that the enemy forces in the Zhanghuabang area have extended their front line from Jijiabao Bridge to Houjia Muqiao and Gaojing Temple, connecting with the front lines in Jiangwan and Zhabei.</p>
<h3>Supplement to the Battlefield Situation of the Previous Day</h3>
<p>The enemy troops wanted to cut off the connection between our Wusong and Zhabei troops. Therefore, they decided to abandon the plan of launching a fierce attack on Wusong with the navy, army and air force, and instead launched a fierce attack on the front line between Wusong and Jiangwan in three ways, hoping to break through one place to cut off the connection between Shanghai and Wusong, and to achieve the effect of encircling or outflanking Wusong. Their attack plan was to launch a fierce attack in three ways, with a coordinated method: one way was to cross the Yunzaobang River and attack Caojia Bridge from around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, another way was to attack Houjia Muqiao from Zhanghuabang at around 7:00 AM, and the other way was to attack Yinxiang Township Wanguo Sports Ground from the upper end of Yinxiang Road and Tiyuhui Road at around 10:00 PM. This was their situation of attacking in three ways.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Attacks Houjia Muqiao</h3>
<p>After the enemy attacked Houjia Muqiao from Zhanghuabang the day before yesterday and was repelled by us, our army's front line advanced about three to five li forward. However, at around 10:00 PM the night before last, the enemy launched another large-scale attack. Our army responded by engaging the enemy in a standoff for three hours. As the enemy gradually became unable to hold out, they successively requested reinforcements. Our army also dispatched a large force to respond to the battle. The enemy saw that we were not dispatching a large force and also increased reinforcements, all of whom were soldiers. At around 10:00 AM, our army ordered a charge, and then advanced in overlapping layers, so that the enemy troops near Xikangjia Bridge and Zhongjiazhai were all surrounded by us. The enemy used mobile machine guns and other weapons to break out outwards, while we threw hand grenades inwards. Each hand grenade killed or wounded dozens of enemy soldiers after exploding. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy collapsed and retreated.</p>
<h3>The Process of Annihilating the Enemy Troops</h3>
<p>The enemy troops the day before yesterday (the 13th) took advantage of the overcast weather and rain and snow in the early morning, using smoke bombs for cover, more than 2,000 people were attempting to secretly cross the pontoon bridge and invade into the Caojia Bridge, plotting to spy on our Wusong positions, but were surrounded by our army. From 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM, the two sides fought fiercely. According to a certain military officer from Wusong who came to Shanghai yesterday morning (the 14th), the enemy troops first used four to five hundred people, using smoke bombs as cover, to secretly cross the river at Jijiabao Bridge south of the river, and then occupied Caojia Bridge. Later, more than a thousand people secretly crossed the river one after another, breaking through our army's defense line and launching a strong attack. At this time, our army General Zhang's brigade had rushed from the rear and led the team to counterattack, surrounding the enemy from three sides and engaging in dozens of hand-to-hand combats. The enemy struggled to the death, repeatedly trying to break through but failed. The bloody battle lasted until about 10:00 PM, before the enemy who had crossed the river were all annihilated, and no one survived. The fierceness of the battle was unprecedented since the beginning of the war, because it did not stop for a minute in those twelve hours. In this battle, our army also suffered more than a hundred casualties, and there were more than a thousand enemy corpses, which are still strewn in the Caojia Bridge River. Now the enemy on the Caojia Bridge front has been completely cleared. After suffering this heavy blow, the enemy will definitely not dare to look at us squarely in the future. It is also said that the enemy took advantage of the four-hour ceasefire between the two sides on the 12th to rescue refugees, and violated international faith by using cannons to bombard our positions on the Yunzaobang South Huangpu River, which can be described as extremely shameless, but at that time our army strictly observed faith and never returned fire.</p>
<h3>Villagers Bring Wine to Reward the Troops</h3>
<p>The night before last, after the enemy troops secretly crossed the Yunzaobang River and were completely annihilated by our brave soldiers, our newspaper reporter went to investigate everything yesterday. After driving for an hour, we arrived at a certain place. In addition to our defensive troops, there were also hundreds of Shanghai citizens' volunteer army and overseas Chinese volunteer army stationed there. The Red Cross was transporting wounded soldiers from the battlefield by truck. More than a thousand Type 38 rifles were lined up along the roadside, which were the trophies seized from the enemy. Passing by a certain temple, the Shanghai citizens' volunteer army was actively training. Soon after, we met Chen Rui, the captain of the overseas Chinese volunteer army, who told reporters that the team members were all from overseas. The battle the night before last was fierce, and the team members went to transport and rescue wounded soldiers at night. The team members all have special skills, such as driving cars, managing telecommunications, and repairing machines, which will make a lot of contributions to the military. At that time, the reporter was eager to go to the front line, but the car could no longer pass, so four team members were assigned to carry guns and take care of him, abandoning the car and walking for more than twenty li to a certain bridge, where we met Liao Qirong, the regimental commander of our army, and Tian Ziyu, the regimental adjutant. The enemy secretly crossed the river on the front line of the regiment the night before last, and the enemy had been completely annihilated the night before last, but our army was unwilling to occupy it, in order to wait for it to come again. Speaking of this, two villagers, an old couple, brought two bottles of wine and several packs of dry food to give to the regimental commander, saying that you have worked hard last night, so I will give you a little something to celebrate. The regimental commander refused firmly. At that time, the regiment had already started dinner, so the old couple personally opened the bottles and poured them into cups. The regimental commander invited us to have dinner together, and after dinner, we returned by the original road and returned to Shanghai by car, and it was already late at night.</p>
<h3>The Battlefield Situation in Zhabei Yesterday</h3>
<p>The enemy troops threatened with planes and shells.</p>
<p>Our army recovered the Jiangwan Racecourse.</p>
<p>The front lines on both sides of Zhabei have not changed yesterday (the 14th), and there has been no contact, because the Japanese soldiers have been pouring all their strength into Wusong for days. However, at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Japanese planes still dropped bombs on Zhabei, but they were all repelled by our army, so it was quite quiet. At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the Japanese soldiers bombarded again, and our army also returned fire, and it stopped after about half an hour, but the number of artillery shots was very small, and there was no fighting until the evening. Our army knows that the enemy troops are weak, and there has been a sign of being unable to take care of one another, so taking advantage of the remaining prestige of the victory in Yunzaobang, at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, they sent more than 500 soldiers from Jiangwan to attack the enemy positions at the Wanguo Sports Association Racecourse. The enemy troops initially resisted stubbornly, but after fighting for about an hour, our army changed its formation and launched a fierce attack on the enemy's front, rear, and middle in separate routes, and finally defeated the enemy troops. However, the Japanese soldiers were still struggling, so our army divided the troops into groups and attacked them. The enemy troops were unable to hold out, and by 3:30 AM, more than half of the enemy soldiers had been killed or wounded, and they withdrew from the occupied land. Our army immediately occupied the racecourse. In this battle, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and our army won a large number of trophies, eight field cannons, machine guns, rifles, and baggage, and searched and obtained several packages of important enemy documents. Now our army is advancing towards Jungong Road to cut off the enemy's retreat and attack them from both sides.</p>
<p>The Central Committee Members Stationed in Shanghai Telegraph and Request</p>
<h3>The Authorities to Quickly Make a Decision</h3>
<p>Listing Four Main Points</p>
<p>Sun Ke and others telegraphed, (titles omitted), Jian, Zheng Mi, it is heard that the military and diplomatic authorities intend to resolve the Shanghai issue locally first, and the British ambassador has also advised our country to withdraw troops automatically, and the authorities believe that it is negotiable. The colleagues in Shanghai have repeatedly discussed, and what they feel is dangerous. They dare to state what they have seen. Tracing back to Zhang Xueliang, the commander of the Northeast Border Defense, who was mistaken in the fallacy of non-resistance, so that the Japanese pirates easily obtained the three provinces, and the military authorities were also afraid of the prestige of the Japanese soldiers, saying that even if all the troops in the country were poured out, it would not be enough to resist Japan. We can destroy the country in three days of war with Japan. The colleagues believe that this kind of psychology is not only completely contrary to the teachings and principles of the Premier, but also sufficient to destroy the party and the country. If it is not completely eliminated, it will not be enough to break through today's crisis. The rise and fall of a country depends on the hearts of the people. In the matter of battle, the material strength of both sides must be weighed, and the morale of the army and the hearts of the people are extremely important. There are aspects of the spirit that cannot be calculated in a few months. In the world's revolutionary struggles, if we talk about the military force relied on by the oppressed, how many times has it been enough to compete with the oppressor, or can it reach half of it? If everyone is as cautious as the authorities say, then the world can have no revolution, and our</p>
<h3>One Part of the Trophies Our Army Gained in the Battle of Caojia Bridge (Photo by Li Zunyong)</h3>
<p>The party's past struggles are really as ridiculous as a praying mantis trying to stop a chariot. However, judging from the past events and weighing the theory of revolution, it is definitely not what the Japanese claim. They said that they would occupy our Zhabei in three hours, and the 19th Route Army has been fighting for two weeks, and the enemy is still resisting. If the authorities still firmly believe in the theory of non-resistance, that is the law of nature, and that the victory of the 19th Route is only a coincidence, and that the sacrifice of the 19th Route in the future is also a lesson that the ignorant and belligerent children should learn, then what else can be said? Otherwise, the authorities should immediately make the final determination, gather all their strength to fight for national salvation. Even if they unfortunately fail, the hearts of the people will not die, and the country can eventually be saved. The so-called "rather be a broken jade than a complete tile" should not be regarded as just a phrase in the article. Furthermore, today, the people's anger and the passion for national salvation have reached their peak. They are especially jealous of those who advocate non-resistance. Looking at the suffering of the people in Shanghai this time without resentment, and the courage of their contributions to help the war, even the Shanghai newspapers that are usually cautious have expressed enthusiastic views, which can show the true public opinion. If the authorities still stubbornly adhere to their advocacy of compromise and submission, or even implement the withdrawal of troops, so that the Japanese army occupies Shanghai, drives straight in and seizes Suzhou, Hangzhou, and the capital, how will they maintain the people's belief and curb the loyalty and indignation of the soldiers? The colleagues are also unwilling to share this responsibility with the authorities today. You should still remember the Northern Expedition in the past, and how far was the military strength of the Northern Warlords compared to ours? However, the revolutionary doctrine was enough to penetrate the hearts of the people and promote the morale of the army. Victory will eventually belong to us. Today is the last unique opportunity for our party to be resurrected from the dead. If the authorities can restore their beliefs of the past, lead the people, and vow to defend the country to the death, who among the people and comrades will have any objection? Fortunately, relying on the power of the Premier, the country will be revived, and the party will be unified. When will we forget the hymns of praise? It is up to you to encourage each other. Now, after the colleagues' public decision, we ask the government authorities to quickly make a decision: 1. Decide on a thorough policy of resistance and no longer hesitate. Immediately declare to the people of the country that they will do everything possible to resist aggression. 2. Gather the navy, army and air force to firmly defend Shanghai and provide full assistance to the 19th Route Army. 3. Immediately order the armies in the north to take the opportunity to launch a counterattack and recover the lost land. 4. In terms of diplomacy, propose that negotiations on the Shanghai issue will not be held until all Japanese soldiers have withdrawn, and the issue of the three northeastern provinces should be resolved at the same time. If the above four items are implemented, the morale of the army will be doubled, and we will be able to persevere. International changes will inevitably occur, and at this time, diplomacy can be said to exist. We sincerely offer our opinions, and respectfully ask for your approval and reply.</p>
<p>Our Army Shoots Down Japanese Aircraft</p>
<h3>French Consulate One-Sided Protest</h3>
<p>The municipal government replied with an official letter yesterday, stating that Japanese aircraft have been passing through the Public Concession and the French Concession for days, reaching all parts of the city and randomly dropping bombs, disregarding the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people in the city. Under such circumstances, our troops cannot but take self-defense measures. It was learned yesterday that the French Consul General Ke Klin protested to the municipal government about this matter. The municipal government immediately replied with an official letter as follows: Dear Sir, I have just received your letter dated February 13, stating that the Japanese troops have been shooting down Japanese aircraft, causing artillery shells to frequently fall within the French Concession, and asking us to immediately urge our country's military authorities to immediately stop this kind of action. In response, I have investigated that Japanese aircraft have been passing through the Public Concession and the French Concession for days, reaching all parts of the city and arbitrarily dropping bombs and attacking, disregarding the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people in the city. It is expected that you, Consul General, are fully aware of this. Under such circumstances, our country's troops cannot but take self-defense measures. Therefore, I, the Mayor, believe that your proposal, Consul General, should be submitted to the Japanese authorities. As for the safety of the lives and property of the people in various parts of our city, I, the Mayor, am also deeply concerned. I will naturally consider the opinions in your letter and forward them to our country's military authorities for deliberation and handling. However, if Japanese aircraft continue to attack our country's troops, the Japanese side shall be responsible for all the consequences that arise. This is what I, the Mayor, should solemnly declare. I am replying accordingly for your information.</p>

<p>Japanese Army</p>
<h3>The 9th Division Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arrived at Yangshupu the night before last</p>
<p>Began landing successively yesterday afternoon</p>
<p>The Japanese army has suffered repeated defeats, and all the army, navy and air force have died countless deaths and have no ability to fight. They have also dispatched the entire 9th Division of the Army from Japan, under the command of Lieutenant General Ueda, using a large number of special service ships, escorted by a destroyer fleet, to Shanghai, and have been importing in batches the night before last and yesterday, and have been landing successively. The news obtained is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>The First Batch Imported the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>The 9th Division, known as the most elite of the Japanese Army, has a strength of about 20,000 men, and the infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineers, and air force are all fully equipped. It arrived outside the port of Wusong the day before yesterday. When it needed to import water, it hired a large number of pilots in Shanghai and went to the Zhongri line of the Nisshin Shipping Company in the outer river of Sanjia Water, and six commercial freighters such as Tsukuba Maru and Maya, as well as four cruisers, fully loaded with the division's soldiers. Starting at 6:40 PM the day before yesterday, they successively opened into the Pujiang River, including infantry, artillery, machine gun teams, etc., and Ueda also arrived in Shanghai at this time. The various troop carriers and warships arrived at the Huangpu and Huishan wharves after 7:00 PM. That night, the officers and soldiers of the division stayed in the ships, and the soldiers, guns, etc., were successively transported ashore starting yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of Japanese Soldiers Arrives Continuously</h3>
<p>Some of the 9th Division's infantry team and cavalry team and communications team were unable to drive into the Pujiang River the night before last. Yesterday, they were transported to Shanghai by the transport ship yakomomoru and three ships of the Nisshin Shipping Company, such as Nagasaki Maru and Urqiiomoru, and were transported to Shanghai separately. The first ship arrived at 8:10 AM, the second ship at 1:30 PM, and the third ship at 2:45 PM, and they arrived in Shanghai one after another. They also docked at the Huangpu, Huishan, and Osaka wharves. Among the three Japanese ships that arrived yesterday, there were about 13,000 infantry, cavalry, and other soldiers, as well as hundreds of military horses. The communications team also brought more than thirty military pigeons for military use. Yesterday afternoon, they were all landing at the various wharves.</p>
<h3>Disembarkation at Wayside Wharf</h3>
<p>The Ninth Division of the Army, newly transferred from Japan to reinforce Shanghai, disembarked at Wayside Wharf on Yangshupu Road at 7:30 a.m. yesterday, led by the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Army, Lieutenant General Ueda. The army wore yellow wool uniforms and yellow wool military caps with a red stripe on the cap, marked with the words "Army". The Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu, the Commander of the Third Fleet, Nomura, the Marine Corps Commander, Uematsu, and the Japanese Resident Minister in Shanghai, Ii, personally went to the wharf to greet them. Ueda met with them on the No. 1 warship for about half an hour. Four or five Japanese police officers were dispatched by the Wayside Police Station to take care of the area. The Japanese Marine Corps headquarters also dispatched four armed soldiers, led by a sentry, to maintain strict security in the vicinity, prohibiting pedestrians from stopping and watching, and immediately driving away those who violated the order. More than twenty large trucks were parked on both sides of the Wayside Wharf to transport the disembarking Japanese troops. By about 10:00 a.m.,</p>
<p>more than 6,000 Japanese soldiers had disembarked and immediately boarded the trucks and drove straight away, making three round trips to the front lines in the Wusong and Yunzaobang area. In total, the number of people was estimated to be more than 10,000. In addition, a truck carrying fourteen large cannons, eight small steel cannons, and more than one hundred boxes of bullets and bombs was also transported to the area. It was not until 4:00 p.m. that all 20,000-plus Japanese soldiers had completed their disembarkation. However, the cannons and ammunition had not been completely unloaded by 5:00 p.m. due to the time-consuming handling.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Arrive at Pingliang Road</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ninth Division of the Japanese Army, totaling 15,000 men, after landing at the Wayside Wharf in Hongkou, had a battalion of artillery stationed at the end of Yangshupu Road, and a battalion of cavalry stationed at the end of Pingliang Road awaiting orders. The remaining infantry remained stationed in the vicinity of Wayside Wharf and had not yet been transferred. When the soldiers passed through Yangshupu Road at 1:20 p.m., local compatriots watched from the roadside. Suddenly, a plainclothes team in a car charged directly into the crowd, injuring about twenty men and women. After dispersing the crowd, the plainclothes team sped away.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Western Newspaper Reports</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Suffers Repeated Defeats in Shanghai Battles</p>
<p>Therefore, they repeatedly requested reinforcements from their home country in order to continue the offensive. According to the North China Daily News yesterday, Commander Ueda, accompanied by his staff and transport ships carrying about 9,000 reinforcements, arrived in Shanghai at 6:16 p.m. on Saturday. Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu, Japanese Consul General Nomura, and many Japanese expatriates welcomed them at the dock. The transport fleet was led by the Mikasa Maru, which arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 p.m. When passing the Wusong Fort, the sound of cannons was deafening, and fierce battles were in progress. The entrance was escorted by many warships, several of which later returned to the Songkou. According to the China Press, on Saturday and Sunday, five Japanese transport ships, carrying 15,000 army soldiers, sailed into the Huangpu River and anchored at the Yangshupu Wharf, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. wharf, and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha wharf. The exact number of soldiers carried on each ship could not be determined. Chinese military authorities stated that the newly arrived soldiers totaled about 5,000, but this could not be verified. Inquiries to the Japanese military authorities were also met with silence. According to the Shanghai Times, the elite Ninth Division of the Japanese Army, totaling 20,000 men, led by Commander Ueda, arrived at the port on seven transport ships escorted by seventeen warships at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday. Fifteen thousand of them were battle-hardened soldiers, and the remaining 5,000 were supply corps, medical corps, transport corps, and engineering corps. When entering the port, they proceeded in single file, with all the lights on the ships turned off, silently, like monsters at sea. It was not until they approached the dock that they showed signs of life. All the soldiers spent the night on the ships and planned to disembark between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. on Sunday to join the battles of Wusong and Zhabei as shock troops.</p>
<h3>Purpose of Selecting Troops to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 14th. After the Kanazawa Division arrived in Shanghai, the authorities no longer prohibited newspapers from publishing news about the army's movements, but its troop strength and other details were still prohibited from being disclosed. It is said that when a part of the Kanazawa Division was mobilized, one division originally in Shanghai would be in a state of peace. The reason why the authorities specially selected these two divisions was because they were equipped with horse-drawn mountain artillery units, so that they could move freely in the area around Shanghai, which has many ditches.</p>

<h3>Important News from the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>Japanese newspapers admit defeat. An Osaka Mainichi Shimbun dispatch from Shanghai by Special Correspondent Kakimoto stated that the current street fighting in Shanghai has resulted in setbacks for the navy due to the inexperience of our marine corps, and the activities of the plainclothes teams are like those of monkeys, making them difficult to capture. The dive bombers of the aircraft carriers cannot exert their power anywhere, and the bombs dropped by the battleships expand the area of damage, with shrapnel scattering into the concessions. Therefore, although the aerial bombings have been fierce for days, the "Neng Lu" seaplane absolutely cannot develop. The Marine Corps is also helpless due to the disturbances caused by the plainclothes teams, because the tactics trained inland (referring to Japan) are very different from the street fighting in Shanghai, and the number of our army's (Japanese army's) wounded is gradually increasing.</p>
<h3>Ueda Inspects by Plane</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (the 13th), Major General Ueda, the Japanese commander of land operations, flew over Zhabei in an airplane to scout the situation of the Chinese army, but was unable to see the place where the soldiers were concentrated.</p>
<h3>Deployment of Enemy Aircraft Field</h3>
<p>The enemy army recently</p>
<p>built an airfield at the east end of Jungong Road, at the bottom of Yangshupu, and hired White Russians to build it actively. It has now been completed. Yesterday, a foreigner passed by the area and said that the field is located at the east end of Jungong Road, about one li away from the Huangpu River, and about 300 meters from the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Pingliang Road. To the west is the roof of the Japanese yarn factory, which is equipped with machine guns and small steel cannons. All ammunition is stored inside. The perimeter of the airfield is about 400 to 500 meters. There are about 40 large aircraft and about 30 small aircraft parked inside. Each large aircraft is equipped with two 250-pound bombs, and each small aircraft is also equipped with three 70-80 pound bombs, so that they can take off at any time. Machine guns are set up around the perimeter of the field, and the defenses are very strict. To the north of the field (that is, near Shanghai University), there is an open space with about 300 White Russians</p>

<h3>Japanese Secret Navy Armbands</h3>
<p>The Japanese newspaper in this port, the Japanese News, said that recently, white cloth armbands issued by the Navy to veterans' associations and other parties have often been sold to Chinese troops at high prices by lawless elements, causing our army (Japanese army) to mistakenly believe that they were Japanese and to shoot Japanese people who had infiltrated the position. It is said that the selling price ranges from ten to one hundred yuan. Upon hearing this, the naval authorities and the consul general have sent personnel to investigate secretly. Once discovered, they will be executed.</p>
<h3>9,000 Japanese Expats Return Home</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Japanese expatriates have been uneasy and have packed their bags to return home, especially women and children. So far, a total of 9,000 people have left Shanghai. Before the outbreak of the war, there were a total of 25,000 Japanese expatriates in Shanghai. Most of those who returned to their country took Japanese ships, and some took American and Canadian ships. Because the ships going directly to Japan were extremely crowded, many took ships to Dalian first, and then returned to their country via South Manchuria and Korea.</p>
<h3>Corpses of Japanese Soldiers Arrive in Tokyo</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported that the remains of soldiers who had died in battle in Shanghai were being transported back to the Tokyo area in succession. From Torigawa Station to the original unit in Meguro, mourning flags were hung along the road, and men, women, old and young filled the streets and lanes, creating a tragic scene. The coffins were sent to Zojoji Temple in Shiba Ward, where they were welcomed into the temple by the chief priest and others to recite sutras and comfort the spirits. The remains of those who died in Shizuoka, Himeji, and other places were also transported back one after another, so the sound of crying has filled the country in recent days, and the bereaved families of the soldiers are filled with grief and indignation.</p>
<h3>Hanjian Executed for Several Days in a Row</h3>
<p>A total of seven people</p>
<p>Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, Cai Fuhan has funded ignorant people in our country to carry weapons and disrupt the security of the rear. Yesterday morning, the military police arrested seven traitors in the Ximen area. One of them, identified as Cai Fuhai, 18 years old, from Danyang, was the leader. Thirty Japanese coins and money were found on his person, tied with red and green rope, used as a mark to be given to those who were hired. He hired one person every day and paid 25 yuan, etc. Cai was taken to the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower at the Fangbang Road intersection and executed by firing squad as a warning. The remaining six were sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wu A Mao and others</h3>
<p>Zhu Baoyuan, the captain of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army of the Republic of China, was ordered on the 7th to侦查 Japanese military agencies and saw six people resembling tilers walking out of them. Captain Zhu compared the rate and led plainclothes soldiers to follow behind. When they arrived near Liu Yin Road in Zhabei, the six criminals disguised as tilers dared to set fire to the civilian houses there. Captain Zhu and the soldiers of the team bravely stepped forward and arrested them all. They were taken to the Zhabei office of the Jade Emperor Palace and interrogated separately. The criminals Wu A Mao and others confessed that they had been bribed by the Japanese to carry out sabotage in the rear. On the previous day, the criminals Wu A Mao and others, six in total, were verified and executed by firing squad at the intersection of Pushan Road, to the delight of the spectators.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army Departs for the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Entrust Chen Gengyao as the Commander of the Army, Actively train military movements, Set off to the front to rescue</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, overseas Chinese compatriots have voluntarily prepared funds to return to their country and organize volunteer armies in order to kill the enemy and save the country. Commander Mao praised the organization and incorporation of this army. On the third of this month, it departed from Nanjing to the front line to serve. The details of the team’s establishment are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Voluntarily Prepare Funds to Return Home</h3>
<p>The team members are all overseas Chinese compatriots who resented the Japanese invaders and angrily returned to the country to join the army. They arrived in Nanjing in November last year and immediately requested the military authorities to accommodate and train them. However, due to various reasons, they could not be established immediately. When the Shanghai Incident occurred, witnessing the national crisis and peril, they could no longer delay and sent a representative to meet with Commander Mao to request their incorporation and training.</p>
<h3>The Division Sends Personnel to Train</h3>
<p>Commander Mao praised them and appointed Mr. Chen Gengyao of the division to serve as the commander of the team and actively intensified the military training of the members in order to participate in the battle against the enemy at the front. The team left Kyoto on the third of this month and arrived in Shanghai. The Division Headquarters allocated guns to the team.</p>
<h3>Set off to the front to rescue</h3>
<p>In addition to active training, they also assisted the military medical department of the 19th Route Army, venturing out to the front at night to rescue the wounded soldiers. The team’s expenses were originally borne and supplied by overseas Chinese compatriots. Now, due to transportation reasons, overseas compatriots cannot fulfill their wish to remit the funds. Therefore, the Division Headquarters has temporarily advanced the food expenses, which is not without difficulty. It is hoped that overseas Chinese organizations and domestic patriots will provide assistance so that they can complete their military preparations and participate in the battle against the enemy as soon as possible. It is reported that the team has no less than 200 members, and although they feel hardship in the military first aid work they have never experienced, they are all happy for the sake of saving the country and the people.</p>
<h3>Tragic Situation of Disaster Victims in Sanyuan Temple</h3>
<p>Rickshaw puller witnesses the brutal acts of the Japanese, Taxpaying Chinese Association requests the Municipal Council to provide assistance quickly</p>
<p>The Taxpaying Chinese Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday: "We are writing to inform you that according to Wang A-fa's letter on February 12, on the 7th of this month, I was pulling a rickshaw in the Yangshupu area when a Japanese person asked me to pull to Sanyuan Temple on Wuchang Road. After pulling to the temple, they held me in Sanyuan Temple for an hour. Then, a Japanese woman asked me to pull to Wayside Wharf before I could escape. There were only 20 or 30 people in Sanyuan Temple, and about one or two hundred of our Chinese compatriots, both men and women, were being held. It was seen that the clothes of many young women were taken off, leaving only their underwear. Finally, their hands were tied behind their backs to stools or pillars. Many old women were also tied to the ground. Men were also treated the same way. The most tragic thing was that the nipples of many women were cut off by the Japanese or stabbed with knives. I could not bear to see my compatriots suffer such torture, so I specially reported to your association and requested you to find a way to rescue them. This is what I saw with my own eyes. Please go and rescue them quickly, etc. When the association heard of the case, considering such barbarous acts by the Japanese, it is believed that people in your bureau and all civilized countries would be heartbroken. Accordingly, we request your bureau to rescue them quickly in order to uphold humanity and responsibility. This letter is addressed to the Director General of the Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>
<h3>Maintaining Transportation Agencies</h3>
<p>No Obstruction of Chinese Merchant Ships, rumors circulating yesterday that Japanese warships would bomb Chinese merchant ships. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Director of the Chinese Board, questioned the Municipal Council about this. The Japanese Director responsible declared that Japanese warships would never bomb non-resisting Chinese merchant ships, but may need to inspect them if necessary.</p>
<h3>Today, Three Ships Sail to Ningbo</h3>
<p>Today (the 15th), the three companies’ ships, Matsuura and Lion Awakening, and the Ning Shao Company's Yongxing ship are all scheduled to depart at 3:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Loyal to Their Duties</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that two Danish employees of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, who are stationed at the point where the cable enters the sea near Wusong, are still there. Only one of their families has left for Shanghai. In addition, a cable ship is also working steadily, repairing and connecting the cable. In addition, the Zhanghuabang Machinery Factory of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is now occupied by the Japanese army as its headquarters. The supervisor of the factory, Melville, also lives in his private house next to the factory with his wife and two children.</p>
<h3>Van Wang Tu Road Repaired</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Fan Wang Tu Railway, which was destroyed by Japanese aircraft bombing, was repaired by Shanghai-Nanjing Railway workers yesterday evening.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Security in the Rear</h3>
<p>Nanshi: For days, residents in the Nanshi area have heard that the Japanese Consul had declared to the municipal government that if there were any more shootings at Japanese warships, corresponding actions would be taken. As a result, the city was nervous and disturbed, and people flocked to the concessions. In fact, the 6th Regiment of the Military Police is stationed in Nanshi. The soldiers of the regiment have not only received higher education, but also have knowledge and experience in maintaining local security and order, and have sufficient strength in combat. This is evidenced by the previous battles in Zhabei, Baoxing Road, and other places with the enemy. Moreover, since the Military Police Regiment has been stationed in Nanshi, it has been deeply welcomed by local people and has united with the police and security groups to support each other. Therefore, the defense of Nanshi is unusually solid.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West</h3>
<p>Beixinjing, Jiangqiao, Zhudi, Zhoujiaqiao, Fanwangdu, Caojiadu, and Xiaoshadu Sampan Factory and other places along the Suzhou River are now quiet. People's hearts have also been slightly calmed. In the Toyota Yarn Factory, Nissin Yarn Factory, Kiwa, and Naimai and other yarn factories established by the Japanese, there are indeed no Japanese troops stationed. All important Japanese employees had already gone elsewhere, leaving only a few employees to guard the factories (this is what the workers of each yarn factory said). In other factories created by Chinese merchants, the majority have started work to increase production and take care of the workers' lives. Yesterday, the Shenxin Yarn Factory also started work as usual. The key points are still closely guarded by the soldiers of Italy and the United States. On each road, the Chief of the 6th District Police Station leads the team of inspectors and police chiefs to patrol and inspect, and the arrangements are unusually thorough.</p>
<h3>French Concession</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Zhabei war, the General Federation of Commerce in the French Concession convened an emergency meeting to establish a temporary maintenance committee. Cheng Hesheng and Shang Mujian were jointly elected to meet with Director General Février to report everything in detail, and they were adopted. On the 31st, a proclamation was issued, stating that the French Concession would strictly maintain neutrality and that residents should not lightly believe rumors and disturb each other, etc. However, bomb throwing and other incidents have occurred in the boundary for days, and several police reports have been filed in one day. People's hearts are panicked, and rumors are rampant all day long, which has a great impact on the security of the boundary. Now, for the sake of the peace of mind of the residents, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession sent a letter to the French authorities yesterday, stating, “We are writing to inform you that the Japanese army is attacking our national garrison by relying on the Public Concession for combat and wantonly bombing civilian residences and killing innocent civilians and other atrocities, which are well known to the world and need not be repeated. The French Concession is an absolutely neutral area, but the Japanese army's covert teams are rampant everywhere, and there are facts to prove it. cannon was discovered. The actions of the Japanese army are not only aimed at our country, but also embarrassing to all friendly countries. Moreover, Shanghai is a concentration of Chinese and foreign businesses, and the Japanese army has turned it into a war zone, destroying the foundations of Chinese and foreign businesses. The military actions of the Japanese army have repeatedly involved the safety of the French Concession, but your bureau has not expressed any opinion. We do not know what kind of mutual understanding there is between you and the Japanese army. Our association feels that it is in danger, and we will separately write another letter to inform you of the facts. We hope that your authorities will pay close attention and not say that the barbaric actions of the Japanese army have nothing to do with the safety of the French Concession and Sino-French trade. This is our prayer. Addressed to Director General Février of the Shanghai French Concession Police Headquarters, Shanghai French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, February 14."</p>
<p>Amidst the Sounds of the Shanghai War</p>
<h3>Matters to be Aware of Regarding the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Japanese invaders are attacking Shanghai, and our national army is fighting bravely and repeatedly thwarting the enemy's offensive. However, the violent Japanese have great powers, and it is inevitable that some simple-minded or greedy people will be used by them. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have issued notices to various guilds. The matters to be aware of regarding the enemy are listed below based on the news obtained yesterday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Prohibits the Sale of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce reported that recently, Japanese people have been buying large quantities of burlap sacks, ironware, timber, oil, sand, and stones from our business community for use as military supplies. In order to prevent military supplies from aiding the enemy, the Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday stating that all guilds involved in military materials must verify the Chamber of Commerce's certificate from the buyers when purchasing the above items in the future before selling them, in order to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>Mineral Ash Industry Strictly Prevents Lime from Aiding the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Mineral Ash Industry Guild of this city, stating that the 19th Route Army Office had notified them that Japanese people in Shanghai were buying lime for military use and requested that sales be prohibited. In order to strictly prevent aiding the enemy, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce instructed the guild to notify its members that anyone who came to purchase large quantities of lime must not be sold to unless they carried a certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Those who disobeyed secretly would be reported to the authorities for strict handling once discovered. In order to strictly prevent this, the guild has sent personnel to investigate at any time and has also sent letters to notify the industry to check and strictly comply with the instructions.</p>
<h3>Taxpayer Association Requests Prohibition of Japanese Plainclothes Team</h3>
<p>The Taxpayer Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday: "We are writing to inform you that according to a letter from taxpayers in the Western District of the boundary, Japanese factories in the Robison Road area of Shanghai West have many plainclothes teams hidden inside. Although the British and American defense forces have repeatedly inspected them, it is difficult to eliminate them completely due to the vast factory area. Moreover, these plainclothes teams are hidden during the day and come and go after 10:00 p.m., intending to cause trouble. The red and green lights installed on the roofs of the factories are used as secret signals. We hope that the Municipal Council will find a way to stop them to ensure safety and avoid major disasters, etc. When the association heard of the case, we request you to investigate. Addressed to the Director General of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>
<h3>Japanese Imitation of Chinese Soldier Uniforms</h3>
<p>Our army recently reported that the Japanese Navy Ordnance Supply Office is now actively imitating hundreds of sets of our army uniforms, and the uniforms have been completed as of yesterday. The intention is to impersonate our army, go to various places in the concession to cause trouble, or transport them to the front line, impersonate Chinese soldiers, and penetrate deep into our position for reconnaissance. Strict precautions must be taken.</p>
<h3>Medical Association Asks to Retain Exploded Toxic Bullets</h3>
<p>The City Medical Association sent a letter to the hospitals for wounded soldiers, stating that many of the wounded soldiers in Wusong have been injured by dum-dum bullets. It has been found that the use of this bullet was prohibited by the Hague Peace Conference in 1899. This letter is sent to you, hoping that your association will notify the rescue teams and treatment agencies to pay attention to the following points, collect evidence in order to report to the League of Nations and expose the barbarous acts of the Japanese to the world: 1. Be sure to save the dum-dum bullets that have been taken out, 2. Take photos of the entry and exit points of the non-residual bullet wounds, 3. The name, age, place of origin, division, brigade, battalion, company, and the location and date of injury of the above-mentioned wounded soldiers must be indicated. In addition, it has been learned that the Japanese soldiers have been defeated miserably and have used poison gas. Please also notify the teams dispatched by your association and order the rescue personnel and front-line officers and soldiers to transport back several corpses for pathological experts to dissect in areas where the Japanese are suspected of using poison gas in addition to rescuing the wounded soldiers. Prove that they were indeed killed by poison gas, and invite medical circles from other countries to participate in the autopsy to provide more powerful evidence. Please also inform us of your findings.</p>
<p>The Municipal Association Please</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council allocated funds to relieve the refugees</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Citizens' Federation pointed out that the Japanese army's unprovoked invasion of Shanghai's Chinese area had already resulted in countless deaths and homeless people. In the Public Concession, the Municipal Council had abandoned its police authority and allowed the Japanese army to commit violence, resulting in countless deaths and injuries among the residents. The Public Concession Municipal Council, which usually receives the obligation of Chinese taxpayers in the concession to pay taxes, should do its best to protect them in the event of this incident. Now that a serious mistake has been made, it is necessary to promptly raise large sums of money to provide relief to the suffering compatriots who have paid taxes on a regular basis. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Taxpaying Chinese Association requesting that it immediately forward the letter to the Municipal Council for consideration and action. The letter stated, "We are writing to inform you that this time, the violent Japanese army used its military force to start a war in Shanghai, and innocent civilians suffered the ravages of war. The refugees in the Zhabei area are countless, not to mention that the areas under the police authority of the Public Concession, such as Hongkou and North Sichuan Road, have also become war zones, and countless people have been killed, injured, and displaced. Most of these Chinese people who have settled in the concession are taxpayers who pay various donations and taxes to the Municipal Council on an annual basis. They never expected the results to be like this. In a positive sense, the Municipal Council should immediately adopt effective methods to stop the violent acts of the Japanese army and restore the powers granted to the Municipal Council by the taxpayers. Determining the nature of the incident is the responsibility that the concession authorities cannot shirk. In a passive sense, the concession authorities, which receive huge sums of money from our Chinese people every year, should immediately allocate large sums of money in the event of this unexpected incident as relief for the victims. This is not only sufficient to show the responsibility that the concession authorities should fulfill to the taxpayers, but also sufficient to show the friendship between the Chinese people and friendly countries. For example, in the previous year when there was a shortage of food, the Municipal Council also allocated 100,000 taels for price stabilization. Now, the suffering Chinese people are ten or a hundred times more distressed than before. The Municipal Council, standing on the path of public and human reason, should, based on the meaning of disaster relief, have this minimum level of expression. Therefore, we specifically request your association to forward this letter to the Municipal Council as soon as possible for consideration and action. The amount of money and the method of allocation are up to your association to decide. We hope that you will consider and reply as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Six-character notice in the French Concession</p>
<h3>Prevent Japanese Aircraft from Dropping Bombs</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese aircraft have often flown in the sky over the French Concession and dropped bombs, resulting in injuries and deaths. The authorities, in view of this, have printed and distributed six-character notices all over the streets to prevent this from happening, so that residents and pedestrians can know where to avoid. The notice is recorded as follows: "If something happens, walk away quickly. If nothing happens, sit quietly at home. Standing and watching in the street may lead to unexpected disasters."</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Resigns as Deputy Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan has approved the resignation of Guo Taiqi, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent by telegram from Shanghai to Kyoto. It is said that Guo will be appointed as ambassador to the United States or France, and the matter has been decided internally.</p>
<h3>Frontline Soldiers Need Mouth Covers and Oilcloths</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Boy Scouts Council yesterday sent Boy Scouts Jin Bingquan and Huang Tiren, carrying 1,058 pairs of gloves, 213 silk floss vests, 110 water bottles, seven automobile tools, four tins of paint, four lead buckets, and four bottles of alcohol, to the 19th Route Army headquarters in Zhenru to comfort the frontline soldiers. Deputy Adjutant Tang received the items. He said that because the Japanese army is using poisonous gas similar to tear gas, they are very eager for all sectors to donate mouth covers to avoid the poisonous gas. Also, with the rain and snow, they would especially welcome donations of oilcloths from all sectors.</p>
<p>Relief News</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Continued to Send Flood Refugees Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has been working continuously to send flood refugees to shelters inland, sparing no effort. Yesterday at 12 noon, the Taichang Steamship Company dispatched a small steamship and the Bureau chartered a small steamship with five tugboats attached. They set sail from the Huoye Wharf, carrying over 700 refugees to be sheltered in Wuxi. Because there were more people than boats, most of the refugees who arrived late yesterday were stranded on the shore and unable to board. Therefore, the Bureau has decided to continue sending them in succession tomorrow. In order to handle the matter thoroughly, all flood refugees previously sheltered must register at the office in the Renji Shantang on Yunnan Road and hold a badge issued by the Bureau to be sent free of charge, in order to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Compatriot Association Sends Away Distressed Fellow Townsmen</h3>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Compatriot Association, witnessing the suffering of many fellow townsmen in the Shanghai North war zone, has been trying to rescue and shelter them. Now, taking their work a step further, they have dispatched staff to negotiate with various ships and preparations have been completed. Starting today (the 15th), any fellow townsmen from the seven counties of Shaoxing who are in Shanghai and wish to return home can collect a free ship ticket at the Association's office in the Qianjiang Guild Hall in Zhongwang Alley, Ningbo Road, and take a ship to Ningbo or an inland river ship to Hangzhou. The office is open from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily. Tickets will not be issued after noon because there is not enough time to board the ship in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>News from Various Red Cross Rescue Teams</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Rescue Team has established a total of sixteen rear hospitals. Yesterday, Central Committee member He Xiangning personally went to the Eleventh Hospital and personally fed bread, milk, and other items to the wounded and seriously injured soldiers. Students from various girls' schools also brought biscuits and other items to the hospitals to comfort the soldiers, helping the wounded by wiping their faces, washing their hands, and feeding them. The wounded soldiers were very grateful and wept, saying that even their own parents would not provide such care, and vowed to repay the country with their lives. In addition, Wang Zi'e, a maid from No. 5 Fukang Lane, Wu Mansion, used her accumulated wages to buy socks and distribute them to the wounded soldiers in the Second Hospital. Furthermore, Gu Zhuxuan, a special member of the Association and the manager of the Tianchan Stage, recently wrote to the Red Cross stating that the stage could accommodate a thousand people due to the refugees in Zhabei being displaced and filling the streets. He proposed setting up a temporary refugee shelter dedicated to providing lodging. For those poor families who cannot afford to cook, he would provide food. He requested to be incorporated into the Red Cross as a temporary refugee shelter, and asked for guidance on how to proceed. A merchant like Mr. Gu can be described as putting public interests first. Furthermore, the various hospitals of the Association have taken in many wounded soldiers and civilians, and students from various girls' schools have been requesting to serve as nurses. Yesterday, Ke Lijun, a student from St. Mary's Girls' School, who was just over ten years old, has been specializing in nursing ever since the war broke out in the eastern provinces and has repeatedly come to the Association to request to be assigned to the Second Hospital. Moreover, the First and Second Teams of the Association's rescue team have been working daily in the Zhabei area since the outbreak of the war, without a month's rest. Many team members are working while sick. Team leader Wang Peiyuan specifically notified the teams to rest for three days starting on the 14th, after which they will rotate in order to balance labor and rest. Furthermore, Mr. Tan Songwen, the leader of the 13th Rescue Team of the Association, ventured to Jiangwan Town at noon yesterday, risking his life to rescue 73 refugees amidst the recent fighting concentrated in the Wusong and Jiangwan areas. After arriving in Shanghai, 33 of them went to their relatives' homes, while the rest were transferred by Mr. Tan to the Dawang Temple Shelter. If relatives and friends of refugees fleeing danger from the town wish to inquire about news, they can contact Mr. Tan at the Association directly. Furthermore, the 15th Branch of the Association's Rescue Team set off at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday and rescued a refugee in Luodian who had been hit in the eye by shrapnel. Just as they were about to return, they received news from the front that a fierce battle was taking place at Jijiaqiao, and the wounded soldiers were being transported to Yangxing. At that time, there was a strong rain and snow, and the vehicle did not have oilcloth. Team leader Wu Jiasan and his teammates Zhou Shuzhi, Hong Qirong, and Wu Xian braved the snow to move forward and transport the rescued refugees back in other vehicles. At the front line, they rescued 14 wounded officers and soldiers. One wounded soldier, in the midst of his pain, still shouted slogans such as "Victory to our army!" and "Long live the Chinese nation!" When the vehicle passed Dachang, the headquarters sent personnel to issue wages, with a minimum amount of 10 yuan and a maximum amount of 68 yuan, which was then sent by the team to the Gongshi School, the 11th Wounded Soldier Hospital of the Red Cross. The names of the wounded officers and soldiers are listed below: 1) Xiao Lin, 29 years old, from Guangdong, head wounded by a bullet, Captain of the 1st Battalion, 5th Regiment, 122nd Brigade, 61st Division, 19th Route Army; 2) Liang Jing, 29 years old, left hand injured, from Guangdong; 3) Tan Feisheng, 28 years old, left hand injured, from Guangdong, Deputy Company Commander of the 2nd Company of the same battalion; 4) Lu Shaoren, 33 years old, left hand injured, from Guangxi; 5) Huang You, 30 years old, right hand injured, from Guangdong; 6) Chen Deming, 23 years old, left hand injured, from Hunan; 7) Huang Guicai, 21 years old, right leg injured, from Hunan; 8) Li Da, 40 years old, mouth injured, from Guangdong; 9) Li Desheng, 22 years old, injured , from Guangdong; 10) , 30 years old, right hand injured, from Guangdong; 11) Tan Shichen, 24 years old, left hand injured, from Hunan; 12) Song, 36 years old, left hand injured, from Guangdong; 13) Sheng Qiu, 33 years old, right hand injured, from Hunan; 14) Juexian, 21 years old, right leg injured, from Hunan. The above are all soldiers from the same battalion.</p>
<h3>News from the Red Swastika Society Relief</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, members of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd groups of this Society, etc., departed in seven automobiles and rescued 46 wounded soldiers in Dachang, and also one injured civilian woman, all of whom were sent to the Second Hospital of the Red Swastika Society on Route Massenet in the French Concession for treatment. In the afternoon, they rescued more than 240 refugees in the Yangxing area, of whom 38 were sent to the Society's Third Shelter, while the rest went to relatives and friends on their own. Yesterday, a car from the second group encountered two bombs on Zhongxing Road while transporting wounded soldiers, one in front of the car and one behind, fortunately without any damage. Jiang Boyun, honorary director of the First Shelter, gives enthusiastic lectures in the shelter every day to create interest among the refugees. Those who hear him are happy and almost forget their plight. Ms. Cao of the Shanghai Women's Temperance Society Nursery in Jiangwan Xiangyin Road reported to the Swastika Society that there are dozens of women and children in the Society who cannot escape danger and requested rescue. The Swastika Society immediately dispatched team member Cao Qianshou by car to a small road near Gaolangqiao to rescue 16 women and more than 30 children, including an injured woman, who was sent to the First Hospital for treatment. Furthermore, the Society sent a telegram to Wuxi, which read: "To the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, National Disaster Relief Association, and Red Swastika Society: We are very grateful for your sheltering and repatriation of Shanghai refugees in Wuxi. We hope you will quickly dispatch a tugboat to Shanghai to transport them and alleviate the suffering of the displaced people. The Shanghai Swastika Society respectfully sends its regards."</p>
<h3>Relief from the Christian Relief Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Christian War Zone Refugee Relief Society has sheltered over 3,000 refugees in the Shandong Road Continental Emporium, who are the poorest compatriots rescued from the war zone by various charitable organizations. The shelter currently has over 50 Chinese and foreign personnel, who are responsible for various tasks. The living and sanitation facilities for the refugees are exceptionally well-organized, and experienced personnel have been hired to manage cooking and distribute meals, so everything is in good order. Women and school-age children are given classes for several hours each day, so as to gain educational benefits. It is reported that the Society's needs are vast and its funds are insufficient, and they earnestly hope that people from all walks of life will actively donate.</p>
<h3>Establishment of War Zone Student Shelter</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of students from various secondary schools in the city is preparing a war zone student shelter to accommodate distressed students. Yesterday, a preparatory meeting was held at the Office Building in Jiping Lane, Ximen, where internal organizational rules were decided and shelter regulations were discussed. It was stipulated that students coming to the shelter will be temporarily provided with accommodation and must bring their own luggage. Military instructors will be hired to implement military training, and distressed students can go to report and stay there.</p>

<h3>Pushan Villa Provides Coffins and Buries Corpses</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army attempted to occupy Shanghai, Pushan Villa in this city, in view of the inevitable large number of fallen soldiers and murdered civilians, has been even more enthusiastic in providing coffins. From the 1st of this month to yesterday, a total of more than 130 large coffins and more than 1,200 small coffins have been sent out, including over 30 wounded soldiers and over 20 people stabbed to death by the Japanese army, all of whom were sent by the Red Cross and refugee shelters via the Hongkou corpse examination office to the Villa for burial. The small coffins are due to the high mortality rate among children who died during the current outbreak of smallpox and other epidemic diseases after the incident. The Villa has also decided to send personnel to collect the fallen soldiers in the war zone in the Zhabei area within days.</p>
<h3>News from Jisheng Society Relief</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (14th), the Chinese Jisheng Society dispatched two ambulances led by rescue workers Cheng Ruizhi and others to Dachang Gujiazhai and other places, rescuing more than 100 refugees.

<h3>Refugees in Runde Lane Await Assistance</h3>
<p>The new residential building in Runde Lane, Seward Road, owned by Gao Zhongji, has 38 rooms. Residents from the Outer Hongqiao area have been flocking to the residence for the past two days, with about 1,000 people temporarily staying in the building. Yesterday morning, it was reported that the owner of the new residence suddenly removed the water pipes, depriving the refugees of water. This is quite far from the Japanese army's defense line. It is hoped that charitable organizations will devise a plan to assist them.</p>
<h3>Endless Comfort</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Remittances Aid the Army. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation received a telegram yesterday from overseas Chinese merchants in a certain port in Nanyang (the name of the port cannot be disclosed for fear of interference from the local government), stating that they had previously telegraphed the port to remit a large sum of money to support the 19th Route Army. 40,000 yuan had already been donated and remitted to the China &amp; South Sea Bank in this city by the Chinese Consul at the port for transfer to the 19th Route Army. Fundraising is continuing.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Receives Comfort Items</h3>

<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Donate Clothing and Bedding</h3>

During the day, it received 57 cotton quilts, 328 cotton clothes and trousers, 10 hats, and 176 pairs of cotton socks from all sectors. Staff were immediately dispatched to distribute them to various places: 1) The quilts were sent to various wounded soldier hospitals. 2) The new clothes and trousers were sent to the rear office of the 19th Route Army. 3) The old clothes and trousers were sent to various refugee shelters. According to Mr. He Xiangning, the wounded soldier hospitals, in addition to the cotton quilts sent, are still short of more than 200 cotton quilts and many cotton clothes, and it is hoped that all sectors will donate as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Silk Cotton Vests Must Be Lined with Paper</h3>
<p>In recent days, donations of relief supplies from all walks of life have been very enthusiastic, and the soldiers at the front have benefited greatly. However, there is still a great shortage of silk cotton vests, and they are urgently needed. We hope that all circles will quickly start making them. However, it is best to line this type of vest with six-tenths of an inch thick soft paper when sewing, as it has a special effect.</p>
<h3>The Enthusiasm of Kun Fan Alumni</h3>
<p>Kun Fan Girls' Middle School alumni Tan Wujuan, Wang Guilin, Zhu Ruilian, etc., each persuaded relatives and friends to donate one hundred and fifty silk cotton vests, which were jointly made by the school's teachers and students within twenty-four hours. Yesterday, Ms. Tan, an alumna, sent them to the China Vocational Education Society for distribution to the loyal and brave soldiers at the front.</p>
<h3>Da Zhong Hua Woolen Factory Presents Vests</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu, the manager of the Da Zhong Hua Woolen Factory, recognizing that the Japanese pirates were invading Shanghai, relying on the 19th Route Army to bravely resist, and now that the weather is cold, urgently needing cold-weather supplies, decided to make a large number of vests from the factory's first-brand national product, Camel Down, and Equality Cloth, and send them to the front for military use. It is said that the cost of camel down vests is extremely low, and their effectiveness is equivalent to that of silk cotton vests.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Exchange Industry Raises Consolation Money</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association, since the Japanese soldiers provoked and invaded Shanghai, has been going on for more than ten days. Fortunately, the 19th Route Army bravely resisted and defended the territory effectively, and the original defense area has not lost an inch of land. All of us in the industry should express our sympathy with all circles and raise money for consolation to fulfill our duties. In the Nanshi area, Chai Yasheng, Zhang Songji, Zhang Suhou, and others have been soliciting donations on the streets inside and outside, and within the city, as well as in the French Concession. They have collected thirty-five yuan from Yu Tai, twenty yuan each from Yi Sheng Chang and Kai Tai Xiang, fifteen yuan each from Shen Yankang, Yi He Xiang, and Yu Qing Feng, ten yuan each from Xin Shun Ji, Xie He Feng, Zhen Tai Xiang, Chen Baochang, Wan Tai Long, and Wan Yu, five yuan each from Xin Kai Tai Xiang, Yi Da, Ren De Tai, Xie Yu Xiang, Qian Kun Xun, Tong Fu, Guo Xiang Feng, Li Chang Nan, Li Chang Dong, Zhen He Xiang, Fang Qian Feng, Zhang Yuanxing, Xie Longchang, and Wan Feng Chang, three yuan from Tong Mao, two yuan each from Wan Feng, Cheng Xin Rong, He Yong Feng, Da Sen Chang, and Da De, and one yuan each from Shen Tiancheng, Yu Chang Xiang, and Ying Feng Xiang, totaling two hundred and sixty-six yuan. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the soldiers at the front. The remaining tobacco shops in Nanshi that have not donated, as well as those in the British and French Concessions, are still soliciting donations and will continue to send them when the amount is collected.</p>

It is heard that the board of directors of the club is now planning to prepare a third batch of donations.</p>
<h3>Consolation from Xinlao Tianxiang Hengqing Three Lanes</h3>

<h3>Residents of Baoyu Lane Contribute to Consolation</h3>
<p>The Tenants' Fraternity Association, organized by all the tenants of Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, French Concession, recently, in view of the 19th Route Army's brave resistance against Japan, which allows the residents of the concession to live in peace and worry-free, in response to the request of many tenants, launched a collection of money for consolation. Yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock, they convened an emergency meeting of all executive committee members. First, Chairman Yao reported the purpose of the meeting, and then the secretary reported the circumstances of each tenant's request to initiate fundraising to console the 19th Route Army. After discussion by the committee members, they unanimously agreed that the tenants were enthusiastic and patriotic, and did not want to lag behind. It was decided that a notice would be drafted and issued immediately, and the committee members would supervise the secretary to go to each household in the lane to solicit donations in order, freely donating as much or as little as they could, aiming for one thousand yuan as the limit, with a minimum of five yuan per building. Once a certain amount is collected (if it is insufficient, the ten committee members will make up the difference), military supplies will be purchased and sent to the soldiers at the front to express their condolences and show their concern. The names and donations of each tenant will be published in the newspaper for credit. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>Approximate Number of Chinese and Foreign Military and Police in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News stated that the number of foreign land and sea forces stationed in Shanghai, excluding Japan and including the French support team that will arrive in one day, is 12,100. In addition, there are thousands of patrolmen and hundreds of special patrolmen in the Public Concession and the French Concession. The numbers of the land and sea forces of various countries are roughly as follows: 3,400 British, 2,000 US Marine Corps, 1,100 US Army, 300 Italian, 3,000 French, and 2,300 Shanghai Volunteer Corps, who are currently responsible for the defense of the concessions. The area of the concession occupied by Japanese soldiers is north of the Suzhou River, starting from North Sichuan Road to the riverside. The Target Road is now almost a no-man's-land. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese military's sphere of influence reached North Henan Road and crossed the Suzhou River. It was only after protests that they retreated into the aforementioned boundaries. The battle lines of the two armies outside the boundaries are not clearly defined, and the number of people fighting on both sides cannot be reliably estimated. The Chinese army has proven its ability to bravely resist the enemy. If this spirit can be maintained and the promised reinforcements can be obtained, it will be difficult to defeat them. The Japanese army's attack does not seem to be developing on any indestructible line. They are currently holding the area from Hongkou to the Pujiang riverside, and a certain distance down along the Pujiang. Their goal in attacking from all sides is obviously to eliminate the Chinese army facing the concessions. The Japanese military has relied heavily on the sharpness of their aircraft and artillery to date.</p>
<h3>A Log of Food Supplies in the International Settlement</h3>
<p>On February 14th, the Public Works Department (工部局) reported that fresh fish and vegetables were abundant at the Central and Eastern District markets today, and business was booming.

This morning, fewer vegetables arrived from the Western District, but a large quantity of vegetables was imported through the Suzhou Creek via vegetable wholesalers. On Saturday, the municipal slaughterhouse had a limited number of slaughterings. In total, public and private pig slaughterhouses slaughtered 432 pigs. The supply of pork was noticeably lacking, but a certain merchant is expected to import 500 head of cattle from Qingdao soon.</p>
<h3>The Mayor Raises Funds for the Gendarmerie's Supplies</h3>
<p>The Sixth Regiment of the Gendarmerie, under the command of Commander Gu Zhenglun of the Capital, joined the 19th Route Army in defending against the enemy's invasion upon arriving in Shanghai. This earned them the sympathy of the entire nation, and their reputation for loyalty, bravery, and endurance in battle spread far and wide, and was highly regarded by society. It is now known that all the regiment's temporary operational expenses and the regiment's supplies have been undertaken by Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng to raise. With the regiment's military strength well-supported and free from worries, all armed comrades are inspired and determined to focus on resisting the enemy. At the same time, Hangzhou Mayor Zhao also transported comfort food and supplies purchased with donations from the citizens of Hangzhou and the faculty and staff of the Agricultural College. This further enriched the regiment's supplies and greatly boosted morale.</p>
<h3>Arrest of the Traitor Shi Ziyuan</h3>

Yesterday afternoon at around one o'clock, as Shi was purchasing ten bags of flour for the Japanese army and passing Yuanfang Road, he was ambushed and apprehended along with the goods. One of his accomplices saw the situation and escaped. The incident was reported to the Japanese army. A car was hired and Shi was taken to the First District Headquarters, along with the purchased flour, to be handed over and severely punished. During the preliminary interrogation, Shi Ziyuan fully admitted to all accusations. He was ordered to prepare a written report and send it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

This morning, three Japanese people from Zhenjiang went to the Public Security Bureau to negotiate something. When they left the bureau, they encountered the crowd and had a verbal conflict. The Japanese falsely claimed that they were beaten by two or three hundred people. They planned to immediately send a fleet to demonstrate. After a certain member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negotiated with Uemura, it was not necessary to send a ship, only one member was sent to investigate and negotiate. Uemura has agreed. Also, the Japanese warships stationed in Xiaguan, citing the fact that the artillery ports of Shizishan and Mufushan were aimed at the Japanese warships, requested to change the direction. Because the Japanese warships had put on artillery covers and lowered the warning flags as usual, they asked the Chinese side to accept their request. Chief of Staff Shen of the Garrison Department replied that strong searchlights were directed at the fortresses every night, causing Chinese soldiers and civilians to be unable to sleep peacefully and the people of Xiaguan were moving out in droves. If the Japanese warships stopped searching in the future, the artillery ports might as well be diverted.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Zhabei Refugee Camp, Simpson Protests</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretary-General of the League of Nations today forwarded to all members a telegram received from Sir John Hope Simpson, Director of the Chinese Flood Relief Commission, protesting against the Japanese army's bombing of a refugee shelter. The telegram said: "I protest in the name of humanity against the Japanese army's aircraft bombing a flood shelter on February 5, containing over 8,000 refugees, killing one woman and one child and injuring four. Several hospital patients died of fright. The next day, February 6, the shelter was bombed again. At that time, there were only a few hundred refugees in the shelter, most of whom were sick, old, and weak people. After this bombing, an inspection revealed that 48 people had died. The refugees in the shelter were immediately moved elsewhere, but the next day, Japanese aircraft came to bomb again. The actions of the Japanese this time were cruel, inhumane, and militarily ineffective." (Reuters Telegraph, February 13th)</p>
<h3>The United States Does Not Insist on Establishing a Neutral Zone in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Avoiding Suspicions of Favoring Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) According to a Washington correspondent for the New York Times, the US government does not support Japan's proposal not to have armaments in Shanghai. However, the US government may support the establishment of a neutral zone around Shanghai to protect the Public Concession, but does not want to strongly advocate its implementation to avoid the suspicion of favoring one side in the Sino-Japanese dispute. If the US government strongly advocates this proposal, people will see the US as favoring Japan, because although the Chinese army has withdrawn from Shanghai, the Japanese army remains stationed there.

<h3>Our Country's Disarmament Representative Arrives in France and Issues a Declaration</h3>

But our country is justified, believes in the conscience of the world, and believes that the League of Nations will be able to recognize China's innocence and cannot but recognize China's reason. The League of Nations is the place where our hope lies, but its resolutions have been despised by Japan, then we can only do our best to resist in order to seek China's freedom and independence, and the people of the whole country are united to be the support of the Nanjing government.

<h3>The Lytton Commission Hurries from the United States to China</h3>
<p>Plans to Stay Briefly in Japan First</p>
<p>San Francisco: The League of Nations commission investigating the Manchurian Incident boarded the President Coolidge here today to cross the ocean to the Far East. US Commissioner Major General McCoy joined them. Lord Lytton, the leader of the commission, said that the group would first land in Yokohama and stay in Japan for at least a few days. If the fighting in Shanghai is not fierce at that time, they may go to Shanghai first to observe the situation, and then go to Manchuria. However, the group has been instructed that its scope of investigation is temporarily limited to Manchuria. According to the group, in order to catch the President Coolidge's ship across the United States as quickly as possible, the originally planned visit to US President Hoover and government officials was also temporarily cancelled because after the Shanghai incident occurred, the group was ordered by the Council to rush to the Far East.

<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese reports, twenty-two railway locomotives and numerous passenger and freight cars have recently been transported into Russian territory, and it is expected that these vehicles will never return. Today, the Japanese military headquarters told people that there would be no conflict between Japan and Russia. The Japanese army does not want to go north of Harbin, and they intend that the Japanese army will soon cease to defend the southern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Japan, apart from stationing troops in Harbin and Qiqihar, does not want to station troops elsewhere. Shanghai estimates that the current Japanese military strength in Manchuria totals between 20,000 and 25,000 men.) Thirteenth Reuters dispatch (</p>

<h3>Rare Phenomenon in the French Parliament</h3>
<p>Entire Opposition Party Leaves the Chamber</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with the New Electoral Law</p>
<p>(Paris) A rare phenomenon occurred in the history of the French Parliament. Last night, when the Parliament passed the electoral law, all opposition party members left the chamber. Only the Communist Party members voted in favor along with the government party members. Afterwards, the opposition party withdrew all members from the various parliamentary committees, claiming that unless the government revokes the law passed by unfair means, the opposition party will boycott the Parliament. Currently, the left wing of the opposition party in the Senate has a slight majority, so it is expected that if the government does not find other ways to save the situation, the Senate will use the excuse of forced voting to interfere with personal freedom and veto the bill. The new electoral law stipulates forced voting and universal suffrage (i.e., everyone has the right to vote) and single-member voting. (Thirteenth National Dispatch)</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Situation in Japan After the Shanghai Incident Continues</h3>
<p>Public opinion: The Shanghai Incident has occurred for more than ten days. Overall, Japanese domestic public opinion is mostly dissatisfied with the measures taken by the warlords and does not want to prolong the situation, attracting international attention. The following is a compilation of the opinions of various Japanese newspapers. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun published an editorial on the 7th of this month entitled "The Shanghai Incident Should Be Handled Properly." Today, the Japanese people have doubts about the legitimacy and rationality of the actions taken by our marines. The suffering of the marines in land battles is an undeniable fact. Since the incident occurred, the number of dead and wounded has continued to increase every day, and the safety of residents in Shanghai has not been achieved. Therefore, today, to get China to stop attacking, there are only two ways: peace and war. First, seek peace. If our country (Japan) cannot persuade China alone, it must jointly persuade China to cease fighting with other countries. Second, take military action. However, using military force is deeply feared to escalate the situation, so it is highly desirable to adopt the first peaceful method. Judging from the current situation, on the one hand, we should try to persuade China to stop fighting by reaching an agreement with Britain and the United States. On the other hand, we should continue to send army reinforcements for the sake of self-defense. In this way, the current situation can be resolved smoothly, which is the best way. Also, on the 10th, the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo published an editorial entitled "The Shanghai Incident and the Manchurian Incident." The sudden outbreak of the Shanghai Incident has alarmed the world. The League of Nations even wants to adopt Article 15 of the League Covenant to punish our country. The governments of Britain, the United States, and France, in particular, have attached great importance to this and have repeatedly protested and warned us. The Council of the League of Nations entrusted the consuls of various countries in Shanghai to investigate the truth of the incident as the basis for judgment. The report of the Shanghai Investigation Committee was sent to the League of Nations Secretariat on the 7th, and it is expected that it will have some kind of attitude. However, Shanghai was originally a large international city in the Orient, with a large number of residents from various countries and complex interests. Now, it has suddenly become a battlefield. The shocking news must have greatly impacted the people of various countries, and those who are far away from East Asia and do not understand the actual situation will have what kind of feelings? Moreover, the Manchurian Incident has already surprised various countries, and now the Shanghai Incident has stimulated the nerves of various countries. If the various countries judge incorrectly, will our Japan not have endless deterioration in the international community? I hope that the government (Japan) and the people will think about it again and again. (The reporter's overall view of various Japanese newspapers is that the criticisms of the current Shanghai Incident are mostly dissatisfied with the government, and we can easily infer the hidden meaning of the above two newspapers.)</p>
