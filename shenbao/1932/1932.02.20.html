<p>前晚　植田司令對我十九路軍發致通牒。提出極其横蠻無理的要求六項。此種要求。十足的挾有戰勝國對待戰敗國的横暴態度。十足的挾有」東亞覇王一的驕恣氣概。末更謂」如以上各項不能實行時。本軍將對貴軍不得已採取自由行動。「我們深惜植田司令於發致通牒之先。竟忘却自一月二十八晚十一時半起。日軍早已充分採取」自由行動「了。尤忘却其所謂」自由行動。「在我十九路軍英勇抵抗之下。亘兩旬以來的拼命攻撃。竟毫未得逞。故植田司令如非健忘。即爲故意作文字上的掩飾。同時於此復令我們廻憶到一月二十八晚鹽澤司令對我巿府提出的通牒。此兩通牒的横蠻無理。目無我國。蓋如出一轍。</p>
<p>鹽澤在禍變爆發之先。日領對我巿府提出通牒。要求取締抗日運動等四項。我們爲貫澈和平初衷計。忍痛全部接受。然而日領一方面接受覆牒。表示滿意。另一方面鹽澤却依然於是晚提出要求撤軍的通牒。同時採取所謂」　　自由行動「决然揭開戰幕這種悍然破壤和平背棄信義的行爲充分暴露了日本軍閥的横暴傲慢目無世界的眞面目鹽澤與植田又恰無兩樣</p>
<p>然而我們却不要忽視了這種近乎文字掩飾的通牒它實在另含有十分陰險的作用它不僅是對我國内行使了離間計策以破壤我國内的一致團結而且對國際也表示了日軍並未與中國軍隊作戰而僅爲與中國的十九路軍局部衝突作爲地方事件以矇蔽國際人士的耳目這種技倆正所以顯示日軍目前已困於現成之僵局無以自解</p>
<p>於此我們敢以至誠爲國際人士告上海禍變之爆發實爲東北禍變之演進而日本實爲禍首自禍變爆發以來我軍仍終始堅持自衛的態度對於前此列强所提的五項和平條件我首先表示接受而日則堅决反對最近國聯又以極誠懇之申請書致日而日非但置之不理且進一步提出侮辱我中華民族至極的無理要求世界人士於此當已認淸誰爲破壞和平的禍首誰爲正義的公敵了</p>
<p>我們對於這種無理的要求决無考慮的餘地我們惟有以一致的團結貫澈守土自衛的初哀我們曾經以熱血答覆了鹽澤的通牒今對於植田亦惟有準備更艱苦的奮鬥答覆其通牒嚴陣靜候所謂」自由行動「之開始</p>

<p>蔣總指揮談話記者昨驅車謁晤我十九路軍總指揮蔣光鼐·及蔡廷楷軍長、叩以對於日方最後通牒之意見、承蔣蔡兩氏發表負責談話、蔣光鼐氏談話云、日本植田司令、統率第九師團來滬後、昨竟承其政府陸軍省之意旨、向我軍長蔡廷楷·致其最後通牒、并着蔡軍長依限期將所部退出北向二十基羅米突之地方、姑無論日本政府侵犯我國家獨立主權至何程度、其違反國際公法、亦爲不可掩之事實、况所謂最後通牒、竟在開釁至二十天之後、致送哀的美敦書、更爲國際法所創聞、本路軍此次抵抗暴日、實爲不得巳而戰、故自上月二十八日戰事發生至今、我軍始終持抵抗之態度、絶非爲侵略或耀武而戰、想爲世界各國所共諒、至日本植田司令最後通牒、亦應呈明政府當局處理之、至本人之態度、始終抱軍人守土有責之義、絶不肯絲毫退讓也云云、</p>

<p>私人意見一斑昨日上午九時、記者至十九路軍後方辦事處訪晤該軍宣傅組主任王志遠君、及其秘書張君、叩以對日本哀的美敦書之意見、兩君即發表如下之談話、關於日本哀的美敦書一事、吾等在未受正式委辦斥駁之前、原不欲且亦并未設想、作任何正式答辯、但旣承詢問、爰就管見所及、以私人資格、姑略一置論列焉、一、第一着爲吾等所必需揭出者、爲日方哀的美敦書之送出、旣然受命於東京政府、則自應以向我國民政府送達爲宜、而不應投送於十九路軍、誠以十九路軍只爲我國軍隊中之一部份故也、所以日本軍隊、如欲在本地有所動作、自應採取與我國民政府直接交涉之途徑、始屬正當、且也、以國際公法之眼光觀之、任何獨立國家、如感到有與某一獨立國家宣戰之必要時、其宣戰書、必須向該國政府投遞之、焉有向該國家之某一獨立機關·或其國軍中之一部·逕投哀的美敦書之理、是原則上已無異消失其宣言之價値與作用、而同時則欲使對方之責任、歸於某一地方之軍人負之、天下寗有是理、今日本竟悍然送達哀的美敦書於十九軍矣、就此情境觀之、吾人不能不認爲此等哀的美敦書之送達、不獨有違國際公法、并且對中國政府有特殊的冒犯、而其終極、則無異默認十九路軍已足與日本政府分庭抗禮矣、二、尤有須注意者、則爲日本在此哀的美敦書送達之前、其對中國自衛軍隊在吳淞及閘北兩處、開始攻撃者、已二十有二日於茲矣、中國民房、旣成焦土矣、中國人民、旣任意宰殺矣、其財產旣破壞一空矣、文化機機關、旣毁壞無餘、而璀璨莊嚴之城巿已成爲廢墟及瓦礫之塲矣、何獨於此種情形之下、而後開始其所謂哀的美敦書者乎、其意豈以爲自經此哀的美敦書送出之後、則前此不宣而戰之結果、致使中國人盈干累萬之生命蒙其犧牲、與夫無量數之精神上及物質上之損失、將一筆勾消乎、抑以爲前此不宣而戰二十餘日當中所受之重創與失利、將諉爲尙未正式宣戰、而欲藉此向國際間保存其强國體面乎、抑以爲前此之暴行猶未足稱爲正式與嚴酷之戰爭、而將併以此藉作護符之租界供其一擲乎、抑必欲以爲從此之後、中國軍隊、將對此通牒無所置喙、而日軍將更有權利肆其殘暴、愈加摧毁華人之生命、愈加破碎華人之財產、而可無所忌憚乎、此吾等百思而不得其解者也、三依照國際公法言之、兩國之間、無論任何方面、未有不宣而戰者、今日本旣置國際公法於不顧、悍然進攻中國自衛防線、又復於啓戰之後、始送出其投失其當之哀的美敦書、則此書果能稱爲哀的美敦書與否、自成疑問、而在另一方面言之、日軍旣肆其殘暴的軍事行動於上海、無日無之、而在中華領土内之作戰狀態、隨地皆是、然則又安所用其哀的美敦書哉、四、且也、中國自衛軍隊、自始至終、絶未踏進日僑生命財產所託之公共租界一步、此又爲彰彰在人耳目之事實、此原足以使彼等目前固不必鰓鰓之過慮、而將來亦無所用其杞憂者、然而事實上、前日軍早巳佔領閘北之一部、迄今猶未已也、其軍隊·其浪人·常出沒於中國地界、以殺人放火爲事、而其空中軍力、則尙無日不惠臨於公共租界之天空而盤旋飛舞也、試問處此環境之下、中國有撤退軍隊之必要乎、抑日本軍隊有撤退之必要乎、倘使日人尙知有」正義「一語存在於人間、則當首先撤退其非法佔據上海之軍力、夫然後始有要求中國軍隊退防之理可言、哀的美敦書中所言、殆窮天下之笑話而巳、又况十九路軍、所駐者爲中國領土、是則人所共喻者、又何所用其撤退乎、十九路軍之守斯土也、乃奉有政府之命而來者、非得最高級之命令、無撤退尺寸土地之責也、</p>

<p>吳淞閘北昨僅小接觸敵飛機昨至各處偵察昨晨虬江路敵軍進犯結果均被我駐軍撃退日軍司令植田謙吉、自到滬後、因以前鹽澤野村兩司令迭次進攻吳淞閘北、均遭慘敗、乃調遣大批生力軍、變更計晝、重新佈置、茲以各事就緒、於十八晚向我巿政府及軍事當局、提出哀的美敦書、昨晚業經我方駁斥、所有作戰準備、我軍事當局、早已布置完備、如日軍仍不覺悟、再來侵犯、决與之作一死戰、以盡保國衛民之天責、昨據外人方面消息、日軍司令已於昨日下午、通知英美司令、渠將於今日拂曉、向華軍大舉進攻、故大戰之爆發、即在目前矣、至於昨日戰况、吳淞方面、甚爲安靜、閘北方面、除前日晚間敵軍向我八字橋陣地發砲十餘發外、僅昨晨虬江路方面敵軍曾作一度進犯、當被我軍撃退、同時敵軍飛機、至我各處陣地偵察、並有數處擲彈、但結果我軍毫無損害、僅僅民房遭燬而已、茲將昨日各項情况、彙紀如後、</p>
<p>閘北方面　　敵軍砲攻八字橋　敵軍於前晚（十八日）七時起、在虹口公園方面、用大砲十餘尊、向我八字橋方面轟撃、至昨日上午四時始停、共開一千餘砲、毫無效果、僅傷我軍士兵二人、惟附近房屋、則被轟燬無數、</p>
<p>虬江路之小接觸　敵軍於昨晨在虬江路方面、以數十人爲一隊、向我方陣地侵襲、當經我軍奮勇抵抗、敵即不支而退、嗣後時以步槍及小鋼砲、向我軍陣地射撃、均未命中、至午刻始告靜寂、　　昨晚今晨之挑釁入晚在十一時左右、閘北及虹口方面之日兵、又向我軍前哨放槍示威、我軍亦還應、因此租界方面、又聞極淸晰之步槍聲、惟未正式接觸、至十一時二十分左右、日兵用鋼砲轟撀、平均約十餘分鐘一次、我軍處之安然、未予還撃、日兵以挑釁無由、乃漸趨安靜、至一時許已平息、</p>
<p>吳淞方面</p>

<p>二月十七日、工部局董事會會議時、財務處長報告、因時局緊急、本月捐稅之收入、僅及當額之四分之一、最近有人期圖勤誘中國人不付巿政捐、此事已由總辦處及警務部及時應付、故於十八日特派收捐員分出微收、惟徵收之法、並未出於强迫、緣有多數人此時實無力繳納也、有若干華人、以錢莊票付捐、及由西商銀行往收欵時、遂發生困難、因若干錢莊、新定一種限制辦法也、就目前觀之、捐稅前途殊難懸測、但不久希望可以將現時無從收捐之區域作一調查、此項捐額之捐失、一部分或可由他區所增避難之人捐額抵補、上年九月、該處長曾對本年之財政作一完全計畫、當時已經指明、倘因有變故、不克於本年或下年增捐、則不得不採取緊急之處置、此次事變起後、該處長鑒於商業上損失之巨、以爲如果增捐、雖僅僅二厘、對於巿民、亦覺有欠公允、因此决取一暫時辦法、即將一九三二年之應提出之預算、照百分之十四巿政捐計算、若無此次事變、則增至百分之十六、固屬合理也、爲本年計、對於某某數項計畫之支出、不能不再爲節縮、而爲維持預算之平衡計、不得不將某數項支出、歸入臨時費項下、而不由捐項内開支、如果將緊急支出幾項亦照此辦法、則以百分十四之捐額維持預算之平衡、或屬可能、因此之故、似不免於早日舉行募債、但非至今後情形較爲明瞭時、未便出於此舉、故該處長擬俟稍緩、再提出應付緊急開支之辦法、或須請某某銀行協助、直至可以舉行募債之時、</p>
<p>關於緊急開支、此時殊難預知其數目、但該處長與最近成立之數個委員會時時接洽、各該委員長、亦窗樂於合作、故渠對此各項出支、仍能細心稽考也、至於商團及特别巡捕之食品用費、在開始數目、每日曾達一萬零四百元、現在多數商團員已復員、而給養又復核减、故每日所費不過兩千一百元云、</p>

<h3 id="e1">From the Saltzawa Ultimatum to the Ueda Ultimatum  彬 <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The night before last, Commander Ueda issued an ultimatum to our 19th Route Army, making six extremely arrogant and unreasonable demands. These demands fully embody the brutal attitude of a victorious nation towards a defeated one, and the conceited spirit of a "Dominator of East Asia." Moreover, it stated, "If the above items cannot be implemented, our army will inevitably take free action against your army." We deeply regret that Commander Ueda, before issuing the ultimatum, actually forgot that from 11:30 PM on January 28th, the Japanese army had already fully taken "free action." He especially forgot that his so-called "free action," under the heroic resistance of our 19th Route Army, has not succeeded at all despite desperate attacks for two weeks. Therefore, Commander Ueda is either forgetful or deliberately making verbal cover-ups. At the same time, this reminds us of the ultimatum issued by Commander Saltzawa to our city government on the night of January 28th. The arrogance and unreasonableness of these two ultimatums, and their disregard for our country, are exactly the same.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the disaster, the Japanese consul issued an ultimatum to our city government, demanding the suppression of the anti-Japanese movement, etc., in four items. For the sake of implementing the initial intention of peace, we painfully accepted all of them. However, while the Japanese consul accepted the reply and expressed satisfaction, Saltzawa still issued an ultimatum that evening demanding the withdrawal of troops, and at the same time, resolutely opened the war with so-called "free action." This blatant act of destroying peace and abandoning faith fully exposed the arrogance and arrogance of the Japanese militarists and their disregard for the world. Saltzawa and Ueda are exactly the same.</p>
<p>However, we must not ignore this kind of ultimatum that is close to verbal cover-up. It actually contains very sinister effects. It not only used divisive tactics against our country to destroy our internal unity, but also indicated to the international community that the Japanese army was not fighting against the Chinese army, but only a local conflict with the 19th Route Army, to deceive the ears and eyes of international figures. This kind of trickery is precisely to show that the Japanese army is currently trapped in the current stalemate and cannot extricate itself.</p>
<p>Here, we dare to sincerely tell international figures that the outbreak of the Shanghai disaster is actually the evolution of the Northeast disaster, and Japan is the culprit. Since the outbreak of the disaster, our army has always adhered to a defensive attitude. We were the first to express acceptance of the five peace conditions previously proposed by the powers, while Japan resolutely opposed them. Recently, the League of Nations sent a very sincere letter to Japan, but Japan not only ignored it, but also further proposed unreasonable demands that insulted our Chinese nation to the extreme. People of the world should have clearly recognized who is the culprit for destroying peace and who is the public enemy of justice.</p>
<p>We have no room for consideration of such unreasonable demands. We can only implement our original intention of defending our territory with united solidarity. We once replied to Saltzawa's ultimatum with hot blood. Today, we can only prepare for more arduous struggles to reply to Ueda's ultimatum and wait in strict formation for the start of the so-called "free action."</p>

<h3 id="e3">Refutation of the Japanese Ultimatum <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Stating that all actions are subject to the orders of the National Government, and the items raised will be answered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chiang and Tsai expressed that they absolutely cannot retreat. At 9 PM the night before last, Japanese Army Commander Ueda Kenkichi and Japanese Consul-General Murai Kuramatsu delivered the final ultimatum to our 19th Route Army and the Municipal Government. At 7 PM yesterday afternoon, Tsai Tingkai, Commander of our 19th Route Army, and Wu Tiecheng, Mayor, delivered the replies to the Japanese Army Headquarters and the Japanese Consulate General respectively. Chiang Kuangnai, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, and Commander Tsai Tingkai also issued responsible statements, stating that soldiers have a duty to defend the territory and will never be intimidated by the enemy. The original text of the reply, etc., is recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>Reply from the 19th Route Army: In reply directly, I have just received your Commander's letter of 9 PM on February 18th, which I have read in detail. This army is a military unit under the jurisdiction of the National Government of the Republic of China. All actions are in accordance with the orders of the National Government. The items listed in the letter have been reported to the National Government for review and handling, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will directly reply to your country's ambassador. This army commander is not in a position to reply. Respectfully addressed to Ueda Kenkichi, Commander of the Great Japanese Army. Tsai Tingkai, Commander of the 19th Route Army of the Republic of China, 7 PM on February 19th, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Reply from the Municipal Government: In reply directly, I received your Consul-General's letter at 9 PM last night, and I have read all the items listed. Upon investigation, the serious situation in Shanghai is all caused by your country's army violating conventions and international law, arbitrarily attacking our country's territory, and brutally killing our country's people. Your country is responsible for this, as repeatedly stated in previous letters. This mayor is not in a position to convey the various clauses that the Consul-General has requested to be conveyed to his country's army and requested to be implemented. Upon investigation, the items referred to in the letter are all issues that could affect the general relationship between China and Japan and should be handled by the diplomatic representatives of the two countries. Therefore, this mayor has reported to the National Government for review, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will directly reply to your country's ambassador to China. However, it should be stated that your country's army is still carrying out provocations, attacks, and bombings without doing anything, which has led to the increasing indignation of our people. Under such circumstances, the so-called anti-Japanese movement is naturally difficult to eliminate. Your country should bear full responsibility for all the responsibilities arising from this. Responding with a letter accordingly for your information.</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul's Letter to the Municipal Government. The original letter from Murai Kuramatsu, the Japanese Consul General, to the Municipal Government the night before last. The Municipal Government has released the full text yesterday. The original letter says: Dear Sir, since the 19th Route Army and plainclothes troops of your country attacked the Japanese Marines on the night of January 28th, Chinese and Japanese troops have formed a confrontational situation in the Zhabei area. Although an agreement to cease fighting was reached on the night of the 29th, your country's troops still violated the agreement by shooting at our side or bombing us, forcing our side to respond. Moreover, your country's troops are carrying out planned provocations, and military operations have also occurred in the Wusong and Jiangwan areas. During this time, your side has spread unfounded false reports about the victory of the 19th Route Army, while slandering our side's just actions in various ways. As a result, the 19th Route Army has launched new attacks on our army, which has no intention other than defending the concession and protecting residents. Plainclothes troops appear in various places and still do not stop their bad and violent actions. Not to mention the Japanese residents, even the Shanghai concession is under great threat. This Consul General believes that at this time, it is extremely necessary to resolve the situation arising from the conflict between the troops of the two countries as soon as possible. Therefore, I hope to end the fighting as soon as possible in accordance with the following conditions. I sincerely hope that your country's army will accept these conditions and hope that your mayor will immediately convey them to your country's army and implement them effectively at the same time. If your country's army does not accept these conditions, the Japanese army will have the fact of free action. (1) Chinese troops must complete the withdrawal of the first line before 7 AM on February 20th. Before 5 PM on February 20th, completely withdraw from the left bank of the Huangpu River, from the northwest end of the public concession, the northern boundary line of the concession, which connects Caojiadu Town, Zhoujiaqiao Town, and Pusong Town, and the line north of the line connecting Lanni Ferry and Zhangjialou Town on the right bank of the Huangpu River to an area 20 kilometers away from the concession line (including the Lion Forest Fort). That is, the forts and other military facilities in that area will be removed and will not be rebuilt. The lives and property of Japanese people in the area near Shanghai that does not belong to the above-mentioned withdrawal area must be fully protected by the Chinese side. If the above protection is not complete, the Japanese side may take appropriate measures. The Chinese side should effectively prohibit all plainclothes troops. (2) After the Japanese army confirms that the Chinese army has withdrawn, it will only maintain the area of the International Settlement roads near Hongkou (including the surroundings of Hongkou Park). After the Japanese army begins to withdraw from China, it will stop shooting, bombing, and pursuing. However, aerial reconnaissance is not limited to this. (3) After the Chinese army completes the withdrawal of the first line, the Japanese army may send investigators with guards to the withdrawal area to recognize its implementation. (4) The protection of foreigners near Shanghai (including the withdrawal area) will be discussed separately. Furthermore, the process by which the 19th Route Army took this action has been mentioned in the letter from this Consul General to your Mayor on February 15th. It is considered that this is ultimately due to the fact that your Mayor did not have the sincere intention and ability to effectively implement the promise made on January 28th in response to the request from this Consul General on January 20th to immediately dissolve the Anti-Japanese Association and prohibit other anti-Japanese movements. Therefore, this Consul General should once again request your Mayor to implement the above-mentioned promises as soon as possible and completely. This Consul General will monitor your Mayor's implementation of this case with great concern. If your Mayor cannot implement it, our side will have to take appropriate measures, and your side should bear all the responsibilities arising therefrom. A combined statement is made in response to the letter.</p>
<p>Commander Chiang’s Speech: Yesterday, reporters drove to meet with Chiang Kuangnai, the Commander-in-Chief of our 19th Route Army, and Commander Tsai Tingkai, to ask for their opinions on the Japanese ultimatum. Chiang and Tsai gave responsible speeches. Chiang Kuangnai said, after the Japanese Commander Ueda, leading the 9th Division, came to Shanghai, he actually conveyed the wishes of the Ministry of the Army of his government to our Commander Tsai Tingkai, delivering the final ultimatum and ordering Commander Tsai to withdraw his troops from the area 20 kilometers north within the time limit. Regardless of the extent to which the Japanese government has infringed on the independent sovereignty of our country, its violation of international law is also an indisputable fact. Moreover, the so-called final ultimatum was sent 20 days after the war began, which is even more of a novel thing in international law. Our army is fighting against the violent Japanese this time because it has no choice but to fight. Therefore, since the war started on the 28th of last month, our army has always maintained a defensive attitude and is by no means fighting for aggression or to show off its power. I believe that this is understood by all countries in the world. As for the final ultimatum from Japanese Commander Ueda, it should also be submitted to the government authorities for handling. As for my personal attitude, I have always adhered to the righteousness of soldiers being responsible for defending the territory and will never give in in the slightest.</p>
<p>Tsai Tingkai's Speech: Tsai Tingkai, Commander of the 19th Route Army, said that since I received the final ultimatum from the Japanese Commander Ueda last night, requesting that I lead my troops to retreat 20 kilometers to the north, I believe that soldiers have a duty to defend the territory and will never be intimidated by Japan. However, I am only a soldier and have always adhered to the responsibility of obeying and defending the territory. All other matters are not within the scope of my duties and I dare not interfere. Therefore, I can only submit Commander Ueda's final ultimatum to Commander-in-Chief Chiang for forwarding to the government for review.</p>
<p>Some Private Opinions: At 9 AM yesterday, reporters visited Wang Zhiyuan, the director of the publicity group of the 19th Route Army, and his secretary, Mr. Zhang, at the rear office of the 19th Route Army, and asked for their opinions on the Japanese ultimatum. The two gentlemen then made the following remarks. Regarding the Japanese ultimatum, we originally did not want to and did not consider making any formal reply before receiving formal authorization to refute it. However, since you have inquired, I will briefly discuss it from my personal perspective. 1. The first thing that we must point out is that the Japanese side's sending of the ultimatum, since it was ordered by the Tokyo government, should be delivered to our National Government, and should not be sent to the 19th Route Army, because the 19th Route Army is only a part of our country's army. Therefore, if the Japanese army wants to take any action in the local area, it should take the path of direct negotiation with our National Government, which is the right thing to do. Moreover, from the perspective of international law, if any independent country feels that it is necessary to declare war on another independent country, its declaration of war must be delivered to the government of that country. How can there be a reason to directly send an ultimatum to a certain independent agency of that country or a part of its national army? This is no different from eliminating the value and effect of its declaration in principle, and at the same time, it wants to make the other party's responsibility borne by local soldiers. There is no such reason in the world. Now Japan has brazenly delivered the ultimatum to the 19th Army. Judging from this situation, we cannot but believe that the delivery of this ultimatum is not only a violation of international law, but also a special offense to the Chinese government, and ultimately, it is no different from tacitly acknowledging that the 19th Route Army is enough to confront the Japanese government on an equal footing. 2. What needs to be noted in particular is that before Japan delivered this ultimatum, it had already been attacking the Chinese self-defense forces in Wusong and Zhabei for 22 days. Chinese houses have been turned into scorched earth, Chinese people have been arbitrarily slaughtered, their property has been completely destroyed, cultural institutions have been destroyed, and the bright and solemn cities have become ruins and rubble. Why only under this situation did it begin its so-called ultimatum? Does it mean that after this ultimatum is sent, the results of the undeclared war before that, which caused the sacrifice of tens of thousands of Chinese lives and countless spiritual and material losses, will be written off? Or does it mean that the heavy damage and setbacks suffered during the more than 20 days of the undeclared war will be attributed to the fact that the war has not yet been formally declared, and it wants to use this to preserve its image as a strong country in the international community? Or does it mean that the previous atrocities are not enough to be called a formal and severe war, and it will also use this concession as a talisman to gamble? Or must it be believed that from now on, the Chinese army will not say anything about this ultimatum, and the Japanese army will have more rights to commit atrocities, destroy the lives of Chinese people more and more, break the property of Chinese people more and more, and can be unscrupulous? This is what we cannot understand after thinking about it a hundred times. 3. According to international law, no matter which side between the two countries does not declare war, Japan has now disregarded international law and brazenly attacked the Chinese self-defense line, and then sent out its improperly delivered ultimatum after the start of the war, then whether this book can be called an ultimatum is a question in itself. On the other hand, the Japanese army has committed brutal military actions in Shanghai, without a day passing, and the state of war is everywhere in Chinese territory, so what is the use of its ultimatum? 4. Moreover, the Chinese self-defense forces have never stepped into the public concession entrusted to the lives and property of Japanese expatriates from beginning to end. This is also a fact that is obvious to everyone. This is originally enough to make them not have to worry too much about it now, and there is no need to worry about it in the future. However, in fact, the former Japanese army had already occupied a part of Zhabei and has not stopped until now. Its army and its ronin often appear in Chinese territory, committing murder and arson, and its air force has not failed to visit the sky of the public concession and hovered and danced. May I ask, under this environment, is there a need for the Chinese to withdraw their troops, or is there a need for the Japanese army to withdraw? If the Japanese still know that there is a word "justice" in the world, then they should first withdraw their military forces illegally occupying Shanghai, and then there is a reason to ask the Chinese army to retreat. The words in the ultimatum are almost the laughter of the world. Moreover, the 19th Route Army is stationed in Chinese territory, which is known to everyone, so what is the use of its withdrawal? The 19th Route Army's defense of this territory is based on the orders of the government, and without the highest-level order, there is no responsibility to withdraw an inch of land.</p>
<h3 id="e4">War is Imminent <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Only Small Contact in Wusong and Zhabei Yesterday. Enemy Planes Reconnoitered in Various Places Yesterday. Yesterday Morning, the Enemy Army's Attack on Qiujiang Road Was Repelled by Our Garrison. Since Japanese Army Commander Ueda Kenkichi arrived in Shanghai, due to the repeated attacks on Wusong and Zhabei by the previous commanders Saltazawa and Nomura, which resulted in tragic defeats, he dispatched a large number of reinforcements, changed his plans, and re-arranged his layout. Now that all matters have been arranged, he presented the ultimatum to our Municipal Government and military authorities on the evening of the 18th. Our side has rejected it last night. Our military authorities have already completed all combat preparations. If the Japanese army does not wake up and invades again, we will fight to the death to fulfill our duty to protect the country and defend the people. According to foreign sources, the Japanese commander has notified the British and American commanders yesterday afternoon that he will launch a large-scale attack on the Chinese army at dawn today. Therefore, the outbreak of the war is imminent. As for the battle situation yesterday, the Wusong area was very quiet. In the Zhabei area, in addition to the enemy army firing more than a dozen shells at our Baziqiao position the night before last, the enemy army only launched an attack on Qiujiang Road yesterday morning, which was repelled by our army. At the same time, enemy planes reconnoitered our various positions and dropped bombs in several places, but as a result, our army suffered no damage, and only civilian houses were destroyed. The various situations yesterday are summarized as follows.</p>
<p>Zhabei Area: The Enemy Army Bombs Baziqiao. From 7 PM the night before last (the 18th), the enemy army used more than a dozen cannons to bombard our Baziqiao area from the Hongkou Park area. It stopped at 4 AM yesterday, firing more than 1,000 shells, with no effect, only injuring two of our soldiers. However, countless nearby houses were bombed and destroyed.</p>
<p>Small Contact on Qiujiang Road: Yesterday morning, the enemy army, with dozens of people in a team, invaded our position in the Qiujiang Road area. When our army bravely resisted, the enemy was unable to support and retreated. Afterwards, they occasionally used rifles and small mortars to shoot at our army's position, but none of them hit. It was quiet until noon. Night and This Morning's Provocations: At around 11 PM last night, Japanese soldiers in Zhabei and Hongkou fired guns at our army's outposts to demonstrate. Our army also responded, so the sounds of rifles were heard very clearly again in the concession area. However, there was no formal contact. At around 11:20 PM, Japanese soldiers used mortars to bombard, averaging about once every ten minutes. Our army remained calm and did not retaliate. Japanese soldiers were unable to provoke a response, so they gradually became quiet and subsided at about 1 AM.</p>
<p>Wusong Area:</p>
<p>No Gunfire in Wusong Yesterday: Wusong was unusually peaceful yesterday, and no gunfire was heard all day. However, the enemy army was very busy arranging its formation. From 2 PM to 4 PM, 32 enemy trucks, all loaded with enemy soldiers and ammunition, drove continuously from Shanghai to Zhanghuabang grain and rice wharf via Jungong Road and unloaded. They immediately went to various front warehouses.</p>
<p>Enemy Warship Activity: At around 1 PM yesterday afternoon, seven enemy warships sailed from Shanghai to Song, and at around 4 PM, they joined two enemy warships docked at Donggoukou and two enemy warships docked inside and outside Wusong, and left Wusong at a speed of 48 nautical miles per hour, speeding towards the Yangtze River. Currently, one enemy warship is docked at Zhanghuabang, and three enemy warships are docked outside Wusongkou.</p>
<p>Enemy Military Preparations: The Great Beauty Evening News reported that today (the 19th), thousands of Japanese soldiers carried various new-style war products and drove to various positions. The Japanese army's actions to advance to the front line began two days ago. The signal team has completed the arrangement of the communication line yesterday. The infantry followed the signal team and advanced. This morning, the field artillery team also began to mobilize. The Japanese army advanced northward from the Hongkou Park area and westward from Jungong Road. A large team of field artillery from the Japanese 9th Division advanced along North Sichuan Road this morning, heading east towards Dithavey Road. A large number of people, artillery teams, and transport vehicles were gathered there, waiting to assist the Japanese infantry, who were digging trenches and defending less than half a mile away from the Chinese army's front line around Jiangwan. The Japanese field artillery team has nine cannons in each team, divided into three platoons, with a caliber of about four and a half inches. The artillery vehicles are pulled by six horses. The Hongkou public area is now fully defended by the soldiers of the 9th Division instead of the Marines, and the Marines are responsible for the rear defense. The Japanese front line from Yangshupu to Zhangjiabang was also very active this morning and afternoon. Troops advanced from the various camps in Yangshupu in an endless stream. The Japanese air force team at the airfield outside Yangshupu is also preparing for battle. There are a total of 60 planes there, including 18 bombers and 13 fighter planes. The rest are being assembled or have not yet been unpacked. Three Japanese destroyers are docked in the river near Yangshupu, and two anti-aircraft guns and many anti-aircraft machine guns have been installed there to protect the airfield from Chinese military attacks. The Japanese army in the Zhanghuabang area is also equipped with hundreds of oil drums, countless wooden rafts, cork rafts, and a large amount of wood for building pontoon bridges in the Yunzao Creek. Judging from this situation, the Japanese army's layout seems to be complete, and a major war may be imminent.</p>
<p>Observations of Foreign Military Experts: The Great Beauty Evening News reported that foreign military experts now believe that if the Japanese army wants to launch an attack from its front line, it must first bombard with heavy artillery for four or five hours, or bombard with all planes for four or five hours, before it can begin the attack. However, the Chinese army's positions, especially those in Zhabei, can withstand the bombardment of artillery teams. Although the 19th Route Army has been repeatedly bombed from the sky, it has not been shaken. However, according to the opinions of foreigners who have been in the military for a long time, if it is bombed by planes with force in the future, it must be even more persistent. If the Japanese army takes the offensive, it will have to fight street battles. If so, the artillery team will lose its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Drop Bombs</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Reconnoiter Our Positions: At 10 AM yesterday, a team of three Japanese white land planes and four red seaplanes flew to the area around Dachang Zhenru in Zhabei to reconnoiter the rear positions of our army. The land planes flew very high, and the seaplanes flew lower, frequently opening machine guns to shoot downwards, but did not drop bombs. At about 1 PM, they flew east. At 2 PM in the afternoon, one land plane and three seaplanes flew out again, reconnoitering our army's various positions, hovering for a long time, and flying away only when it was dark.</p>
<p>[IP&gt;民房被炮弹炸毁于蕴藻浜（李子洋摄）</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Dropped Bombs in Liuhe: At 1 PM yesterday afternoon, two Japanese planes flew from the east to Liuhe and dropped several heavy bombs, and then drove west. According to the post-incident investigation, one woman was injured and two civilian houses were destroyed.</p>
<p>Bombs Injured People on Guoqing Road: At about 7 AM yesterday morning, enemy planes dropped bombs again in the Zhabei area. One bomb landed in the middle of Guoqing Road, and after the explosion, two pedestrians were killed and one coolie was injured. Also, near the Xiaocai market on Gonghe Xin Road, an enemy plane dropped a bomb that did not explode. Its weight is estimated to be over 100 pounds. Also, in the afternoon, near the Zhijiangmiao Road on Gonghe Xin Road, a Japanese artillery shell fell and exploded on the spot, killing a Jiangbei cart driver, over 30 years old, Guo San, over 20 years old, and Ms. Qian, over 30 years old, a total of three men and women.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Commander Cai Angrily Denounces Japanese Fabrication <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Reuters reports that the Japanese representative's statement in Geneva regarding the Nineteenth Route Army has deeply angered the people of Shanghai, especially those in the military. Jiang Guangnai, the General Commander of the Nineteenth Route Army, and Cai Tingkai, the Commander of the Nineteenth Route Army, told reporters that such false statements only damage the reputation of the Japanese representative in Geneva. No statement in the history of world diplomacy has ever been such a shameless lie. Because the Japanese invasion of China has not achieved its goals, they call our Nineteenth Route Army a dangerous element. They have already learned a lesson from us and are now terrified at the mere mention of our name. Just look at the massive amount of慰問 goods that the people of Shanghai have given to our soldiers; you can see whether we are welcome by the local people. As for the claim that our army harbors Communist elements and foreign missionaries, it is a clear lie. Last year, on September 7th and 8th, it was the soldiers of our Nineteenth Route Army who fought against the Communist army in Jiangxi. Our army has been engaged in suppressing the Communists in Jiangxi for two years now. Furthermore, their attempts to sow discord by saying that the Chinese government intends to disband our army and monitor our actions are completely worthless. The major operations were carried out under the orders and guidance of the central government. They deeply trust in our army's loyalty and bravery, so they constantly provide financial support, weapons, and reinforcements. The reinforcements they send are also under our command. How can they say such things based on this? Looking at the orders from the central government and the statements we have repeatedly made to reporters, you can see the close relationship between the Nineteenth Route Army and the central government.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Newspaper Praises Cai Tingkai as a New Chinese Hero <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese newspaper Osaka Asahi Shimbun states that in this Shanghai Incident, Cai Tingkai, the new hero of China, stands in stark contrast to Ma Zhanshan, the hero of the North, as a rare and valuable military talent. Cai, currently the commander of the Nineteenth Route Army, is not yet forty years old. Cai was originally under Chen Mingshu's command and now leads the Sixtieth Division, the Sixty-first Division, and the Seventy-eighth Division in fighting against our army (the Japanese army) near Shanghai. Cai's troops are the most fearsome and ever-victorious army in the South. Their determination to defeat the Japanese army is extremely strong. Currently, the Chinese people almost worship him as a war god because they are happy to hear about his daily victories over the Japanese army. In short, it is rare to find such a uniquely brave army in the Chinese army that can stubbornly resist our army (the Japanese army) without fearing our army's fierce bombardment. What is most strange is that when ○○○ and others went to the Nineteenth Route Army headquarters in Zhenru on the third of this month to hold a military meeting, ○○○ and others strongly advocated a ceasefire to stop the Chinese attack, but Cai was very angry and insisted on fighting.</p>
<p>Also, the Japanese Nagoya Shimbun reported that "the enemy's Seventy-eighth Division is the bravest unit in the Chinese army." Our army (the Japanese army) has suffered heavy losses because we are unfamiliar with street warfare. The enemy army (our army)'s Seventy-eighth Division was originally the bravest unit in the Chinese army and cannot be compared with other Chinese troops. Furthermore, the enemy general Cai Tingkai has fiercely resisted our army (the Japanese army) at the cost of his life, so that our country's continuous attacks have ultimately failed.</p>
<h3 id="e7">British and American Consulates Notify Nationals to Evacuate the Hongkou Area <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Avoidance</p>
<p>The Da Mei Wan Bao reports that the American Consul in Shanghai, fearing that the Chinese and Japanese armies will resume fighting with even greater intensity, issued a notice today (the 19th), advising nationals in the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts east of the Suzhou Creek and along the Huangpu River to evacuate as much as possible during the bombardment by both sides. The American Consul General's notice states that if negotiations with the Japanese fail and hostilities resume, it will be more severe than before. Shells may fall within the concession, and the area east of Suzhou Road and the Yangshupu district and the area near the Huangpu River are particularly dangerous. Therefore, the American Consul General specifically advises American nationals to evacuate as much as possible during the bombardment by both sides and reside in safer areas. Women and children should move to safer places this afternoon or tomorrow morning. The British Consul General's notice is largely the same as that issued by the American Consul General, except that it does not include the sentence urging women and children to move early.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Declaration of the Shanghai Various Organizations Salvation United Association to the Japanese Army Note <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Various Organizations National Salvation United Association's declaration to the Japanese army note states: Ueda Kenkichi, the third Japanese army commander to invade Shanghai, and Murai Masao, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, simultaneously sent a note to the commander of our Nineteenth Route Army and the Shanghai Municipal Government on the twenty-first day after the Japanese army launched its attack on us (i.e., February 18), proposing six articles, forgetting that Shanghai is an inseparable part of the Republic of China, and demanding that our defending officers and local government withdraw from the 20-kilometer-守地基罗密达 land under their command, including Wusong cannons, and demolish their fortifications and military facilities, so that the Japanese military can send investigators carrying the Japanese flag and guards to reside in the area. At the same time, they still demand strict compliance with Mayor Wu's agreement before the outbreak of war on January 28, otherwise the Japanese military will take free action. These demands disregard our territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity, and aim to bring Wusong, the gateway to our Yangtze River, under their control, not only choking the throat of our entire country, but also threatening the world powers that trade with us. Our military leaders bear the responsibility of defending the territory and protecting the country, and naturally exercise the right of justified defense. This Association, on behalf of the 11 organizations in the Association and the 3 million people under the various organizations, expresses its deepest gratitude to the victorious combat soldiers on the front line for dealing with the Japanese militarists who are wantonly and severely undermining world peace. Even if we exhaust all our resources and shatter our bodies, we will not hesitate. However, the target of the violent Japanese militarists' aggression is by no means limited to Shanghai, nor is it limited to the Republic of China. We hope that the National Government, the military leaders of various provinces and regions, and the people at home and abroad will simultaneously rise up to resist the brutal and powerful enemy. We especially hope that the world powers, for the sake of the sacred treaties of peace, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, will maintain their existence and take appropriate and effective measures against Japan, which has violated these treaties. Then, the people of Shanghai will sacrifice themselves for the sake of world peace, and the day of death will be the year of birth. We hereby declare this, and hope for public recognition. Shanghai Lawyers Association, General Labor Union, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Accountants Association, Lawyers Association, Anti-Japanese Association of Major Professors, and other national organizations of the United Association announced.</p>

<h3 id="e10">National Crisis Association Cables League of Nations to Stop Illegal Japanese Actions <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Republic of China National Crisis Relief Association sent a telegram to the League of Nations stating: Geneva, China's representative Dr. Yan, forward to the League of Nations Conference: Japan launched a military attack on our three northeastern provinces on September 18 last year, without ever submitting its so-called Sino-Japanese dispute to the League of Nations for resolution. This not only deliberately violates the League of Nations Charter, but is also an explicit act of war against the member countries of the League of Nations. The Chinese government, trusting in the League of Nations to have the power to impartially mediate any disputes between member countries, and firmly believing that the League of Nations would compel Japan to abide by the League of Nations Charter, did not resist the illegal Japanese aggression with force. However, it did not expect that the Japanese would repeatedly disregard the resolutions passed by the League of Nations on September 30 and November 10 last year, and the League of Nations would delay the implementation of the provisions of Article 16 of the Charter, causing deep disappointment to the Chinese people and increasing the Japanese ambition for aggression. Recently, they have gone further, occupying the entire territory of our three northeastern provinces and, on January 28 of this year, expanding the scope of their aggression by openly dispatching a large army to fiercely attack Shanghai, the only important commercial port in our East, and using the Shanghai Public Concession as a base for attacking our Chinese army. At the same time, they have wantonly and indiscriminately murdered and destroyed the lives and property of our innocent citizens. Not only have our municipal hospitals, industrial factories, and educational and cultural institutions been repeatedly destroyed, but even public charity organizations, such as Red Cross ambulances and refugee shelters, have been harmed. Such behavior is truly an unprecedented atrocity rarely heard of in the history of modern human warfare, and it is not only a public enemy of modern culture and humanitarianism, but also renders all international League of Nations public law, the Washington Nine-Power Peace Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact scraps of paper. We should ask your association to uphold justice and quickly take effective measures to stop the Japanese from deliberately destroying various treaties and committing inhumane illegal acts, so as to maintain the sacred spirit of the various treaties. The Republic of China National Crisis Relief Association, Jian.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Xue Dubi Advocates Resolutely Defending Shanghai <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Xue Dubi wrote to Song Ziwen, saying: Mr. Ziwen, long time no see, I hope you are well. Although we are near, we are far apart, how sad. Recently, I read in the newspaper that you spoke, denouncing the Japanese for only sending an ultimatum to the Nineteenth Route Army, pointing out that they were intentionally sowing discord and insulting our country. I admire your insight and honesty. However, the Shanghai war has been going on for more than ten days. The Japanese have stated that they are fighting with the Nineteenth Route Army, not with the Chinese nation, and have published various rumors in their newspapers, sowing discord within us and alienating our military's morale. The articles are so numerous that they are almost impossible to refute. Who is doing this, and who is causing this? I believe that our military authorities cannot escape their responsibility. Capitulation is ineffective, and we have already lost face. The enemy's greed has no end. Our military authorities still want to adhere to their policy of non-expansion in order to seek compromise. As a result, the three-day ceasefire followed the enemy's plan, and a certain minister advised our army to withdraw automatically first in order to save the face of the Japanese army, without considering the interests of our country. The officers and soldiers of our Nineteenth Route Army have been forced to bravely resist, while the opinions of our military authorities are still hesitant and undecided. This inside story has not only been seen through by the Japanese, but also known to people from various countries. It is impossible for our army to withdraw automatically. We should give up all hope and resolutely resist the enemy. "Omitted." I believe that the time has come. Empty words are useless. Only by the military authorities abandoning their policy of non-expansion and the government immediately declaring that negotiations will not proceed until the Japanese army withdraws, and concentrating its strength to defend Shanghai, and at the same time strictly ordering Zhang Xueliang to seize the opportunity to recover the lost territories, and the entire military and civilians of the country uniting to prepare for a decisive battle, to show a firm attitude, can we explain the misunderstandings of our people, eliminate the enemy's discord, and strengthen our military's morale and weaken their morale. From the Northeast Incident to now, the folly of non-resistance and the value of resistance have been as clear as fire. What hesitation is there? What spirit and prejudice can be argued about at this time of national crisis? Whoever can resist the enemy, whoever can save the nation, whoever can lead our nation to fight against the violent Japan will be respected and supported by our 400 million compatriots, and we will not have time to worship them. Unless they are insane, who would be willing to have internal strife? All of the above are for the love of the country, the love of the government, and the love of our party's armed comrades with a revolutionary history. They are based on a pure heart and are a blood-sincere contribution, with no other purpose involved. I hope you will understand and correct me. The country is fortunate, the nation is fortunate. Xue Dubi respectfully. February 19, early morning.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Japanese Slanderous Propaganda <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Proposing the Establishment of an Independent State of Shanghai / Slandering Our Loyal and Brave General Cai Who Defends the Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Local Maintenance Association received a telegram from New York on February 17 stating that the New York Sun reported that Japan had proposed to the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy to establish an independent state of Shanghai, including the Public Concession, the French Concession, Liuhang, Wusong, Zhabei, Kunshan, Zhenru, and Songjiang. It also stated that General Cai Tingkai is currently conducting this negotiation with the Japanese authorities. When this news was heard here, rumors of attempting to buy off the Nineteenth Route Army were aroused. (Translator's note: Regarding the establishment of an independent state of Shanghai, it was previously reported by Reuters from London that the Times reported that some people had this intention. Slandering our Nineteenth Route Army Commander Cai Tingkai is actually misleading the international community and overseas compatriots. It can also be seen that the Japanese are fabricating rumors meticulously. I hope that the national salvation organizations in this port will quickly find ways to provide accurate information to overseas countries to avoid being deceived by Japanese propaganda.)</p>

<p>The Taxpayers' Association Replied to the Municipal Party Department Yesterday, stating: In reply to your letter of February 11, we greatly appreciate your instructions regarding the tax issue. However, in the observation of this association, the current situation is not a dispute between the taxpayers and the Public Works Department, but an international relationship. The question of international capability. We reply to your letter as requested. We hope you will investigate and take note.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Issue of Deferring Payment of Domestic Debt <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Bankers' Association and others Discussed Yesterday and the day before, Finance Minister Song Ziwen hosted a meeting with the banking community at the Bankers' Association, attended by the Bankers' Association, Money Dealers' Association, Exchange, Domestic Bondholders' Association, and Two-Five Treasury Fund Custody Association, and other groups. After a long discussion, it was generally agreed that, given the government's financial difficulties, the public should understand its position. However, the government should also make efforts to maintain the people's livelihood, as most people rely on domestic bonds for their livelihood. If problems arise, society will panic. Therefore, it was decided that the Ministry of Finance could fully negotiate on reducing or delaying the payment of principal and interest on domestic debt, but expressed opposition to suspending payments. It is understood that the central government pays a total of 16 million yuan per month for the principal and interest on domestic debt. As for foreign debt, the amount is small, and it is usually deducted by the Jianghai Customs in advance. This incident did not include foreign debt.</p>
<p>Declaration of the China National Crisis Association Yesterday, the China National Crisis Relief Association issued a declaration maintaining public debt, stating: The bonds issued by the National Government, with an outstanding amount of more than 700 million yuan, are circulating in the market as a reserve for banknotes and investments for savings, and have become a large part of the national property. Recently, there has been a proposal to reduce the payment of principal and interest, causing social unrest and panic of bankruptcy. If it is the government and it is finance, the authorities first freely issue, and then arbitrarily reduce payments, without setting up a plan for the people and pushing them into a trap. The people have nowhere to die. How can the government maintain its credit and act like a people on high? All countries exchange public bonds and must consider market conditions and pass them through parliament, or at the time of changes in cabinet policy. There has never been a self-digging, self-defeating, or ever-changing situation. This association has been working hard for the national crisis, believing that at this critical time, it is impossible to create an economic panic again and cause the whole country to perish. The proposal to reduce the payment of principal and interest on public debt is absolutely unacceptable. However, since foreign troubles are spreading, we should unite to resist the enemy. Without questioning the government's past waste, we should plan for future financial reforms. We would like to mention several points to inform the people of the country: 1. The government should announce the current state of financial revenue and expenditure to the people of the country, and each public group should elect a special financial committee to thoroughly review and plan and implement the supervision of finance. 2. The principal and interest of public debt can only be extended and delayed for a part of the payment, and should be used for the national crisis and compensated afterwards. The government cannot arbitrarily change the original plan, which is equivalent to defaulting. 3. A part of the deferred interest should be stored in a special account (organized by each public group) and managed exclusively for resisting foreign aggression. It cannot be wasted by the government on non-resistant troops and ineffective agencies (such as party expenses). In the future, without the consent of the formal public opinion organs, no more public debts should be issued to increase the burden on the people. The financial community will also criticize those who have abused the issuance of bonds by the government. The above points are based on the most common public examples in finance and are by no means startling theories. All our people who want to preserve the investment in public debt must first strive to supervise the government's finances. If you can supervise finance, then the principal and interest of public debt will be protected. If you cannot supervise finance, then even if you are lucky enough to be safe for a while, you will eventually leave trouble for the future. Today, there is a panic about reducing the payment of principal and interest, which is the result of letting the government waste in the past. In other words, it is the lesson of not knowing how to supervise finance. Previously, there was news of fluctuations in public debt, and social figures ran around calling out, without end. The government has also repeatedly issued orders, vowing to maintain bond credit. Now, the blood on the mouth is not dry, but the news of change is coming again. I hope that the social and financial communities can maintain this spirit of struggle and adhere to the non-retreat, so that the government can enter the right track. This is what the association hopes for. I hereby declare,</p>
<p>American Losses in the Shanghai War</p>
<p>US Government to Hold China and Japan Separately Responsible</p>
<p>The Da Mei Wan Bao published a special dispatch from Washington on the 19th, stating that the U.S. government will hold the Chinese and Japanese governments responsible for any loss of life and property suffered by Americans as a result of the Shanghai war. The State Department will issue a note today clarifying the U.S. government's position, which is said to hold China and Japan separately, rather than jointly, responsible for the losses.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Pedestrians Still Find It Difficult to Pass Freely in the Hongkou Area <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department and the Japanese Army Have Not Yet Reached an Agreement</p>
<p>The Continental Newspaper reports that the Public Works Department police and the Japanese military authorities have reportedly agreed on a number of measures yesterday (18th) regarding the passage of pedestrians north of Bazilu. All police and business groups wearing uniforms, and residents holding passes issued by the Japanese Consul General's Office with photos attached, can pass freely. If you want to move furniture, Chinese people must ask the Superintendent to issue a separate certificate. As for allowing pedestrians to pass freely in the Hongkou area, the two sides have not yet reached an agreement. The Japanese military authorities still do not allow the police in the area to resume full authority, and only allow foreigners to pass freely. Chinese people must be recognized as genuine residents of the area before they can pass freely, but they must still be subject to Japanese searches. It is also reported that the Japanese side proposed that Chinese people not be allowed to walk on the streets in the Hongkou area between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., but the Public Works Department refused to accept this, because it would greatly restrict the service of the Hongkou police.</p>

<p>Headquarters Set Up in the Money Shop Guild Hall</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that since the final unreasonable demands of the Japanese were firmly rejected by our army, the situation in this port has become increasingly tense. The defense line north of the Suzhou Creek, from the North Jiangxi Road in the east to the North Xizang Road in the west, was originally scheduled to be taken over by the United States. At the beginning of the war, the American troops stationed in Shanghai were insufficient to be dispatched, so they were replaced by the International Volunteer Corps. However, since yesterday, the defense of this section has been completely taken over by the American troops alone. Its headquarters is located in the Money Shop Guild Hall west of the Peng Road vegetable market, with the American flag hanging in front of the door. However, no American troops were seen stationed on the North Jiangxi Road and Hainning Laobazi Road. It is rumored that they are afraid of conflicts with the Japanese army, so the Hongkou police station sent Chinese and Western police officers to guard the area.</p>
<h3 id="e17">The Enemy Has No Possibility of Using Poison Gas <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The People of the Country Should Not Be Fooled by Enemy Propaganda</p>
<p>Wan Cesian wrote a letter stating that reports have stated that Japanese soldiers will use poison gas in Shanghai. The Japanese are barbaric and violent, and it is difficult to ensure that they will not do so. The people of the country are running around in terror, spreading the word. It is inevitable that they are biased and believe in enemy propaganda, harming their own morale. The Shanghai war is a close-range war and it is not suitable to use poison gas, because if the user does not wear a gas mask, they will suffer the same harm. If they wear a mask, their vision and movement will be hindered, which will greatly reduce the combat activity, and give our army the best opportunity to charge. As for Wusong and Jiangwan, the land is sparsely populated, the sea breeze is very strong, and the weather is humid and cold, which are not conducive to the use of poison gas. Moreover, even in the terrain and circumstances suitable for the use of poison gas, the number of military deaths due to poison gas, according to European war statistics, is less than one-twentieth of those killed or injured by guns and cannons, because poison gas injuries are easier to treat and less painful. The Japanese side saw that our army was brave and could not attack, so it intentionally created rumors in order to shake our military's morale. I hope that our loyal and brave soldiers will not be fooled, and I hope that the national press will not be used by the enemy and cause self-disturbance.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Efforts in Relief Work <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The International Red Cross Society and the Chinese Red Cross Society informed the Japanese Buddhist Federation of the misunderstanding caused by the Japanese military's shelling of the Society. Yesterday, they received a reply stating that they had telegraphed the Japanese Red Cross Society, requesting its government to order the front-line soldiers to protect the Society according to the agreement.</p>
<p>Important Work of the Municipal Temporary Relief Committee: The Shanghai Municipal Temporary Relief Committee, organized by the Jiangsu Provincial National Disaster Relief Committee, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Life Weekly, etc., has, since its establishment, raised and sent comfort items, food, vehicles, etc. to the anti-Japanese army, with a value of over 200,000 yuan. Together with the Municipal and Local Maintenance Committees, they have successively sent representatives Cai Wangzhi, Wang Yincai, Zhu Dexuan, and Sun Baogang to various counties to liaise and publicize, and to fully supply military rice, and concentrate the people's armed forces, to prepare for a long-term resistance against the violent Japanese, which has been quite effective. Recently, in view of the fact that the wounded soldiers in various hospitals and the refugees in various shelters are in dire need of spiritual comfort, the Committee organized: 1. A Comfort and Education Team for the Wounded Soldiers, led by Zhu Weiyuan, Gu Xuhou, and four others, who go to various hospitals for wounded soldiers every day to provide food and daily necessities, and hold individual or group talks, focusing on the glory of being wounded in the anti-Japanese war and the shame of engaging in civil wars, and also give them books that are beneficial to their physical and mental health, and at the same time help them solve difficulties and write letters; 2. A Propaganda Team for Refugee Shelters, led by Yang Chonggao, Zheng Wenhan, Chen Shudong, and nine others, who go to various shelters to: 1. Comfort the refugees, 2. Explain the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers, 3. Advocate the permanent boycott of Japanese goods, 4. Report on the war situation, 5. Explain the significance of registration. For children, they provide appropriate education. Of the 57 shelters in the city, they have already visited 46. After visiting all the shelters, they will publish a general overview of each shelter.</p>
<p>News from the War Zone Temporary Relief Committee: All 17 shelters of the Shanghai War Zone Temporary Relief Committee are already full, and the rescue teams are still departing every day. Yesterday, they rescued more than 100 people from Dazhang and other places. On the one hand, people took refuge on their own and pleaded to be taken in, which was especially endless. The association, being limited by space and having many people, and although having sent many people to other places via Lu Rao, still felt that it was impossible to accommodate them. It is now proposed to repatriate all foreign refugees who have no relatives in Shanghai, no permanent property, and no permanent occupation to their places of origin. Arrangements have now been made to contact shipping companies, it is said. In addition, the association rescued 828 refugees on the 18th. In addition to 135 people who were sent to Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, the rest were sent to the association's various shelters. In addition, a total of 196 people were taken from various shelters and sent to other places. In addition, more than 100 people were captured by the Japanese army among the war zone refugees, and their relatives reported to the association. Yesterday, the association sent a negotiation team with the list of those arrested to negotiate with the Japanese Consul. As a result, the Deputy Consul agreed to check the list and release them. In addition, the association has listed and published the names of refugees in the association's shelters whose relatives have been separated, hoping that their relatives will go to the association to claim them. The list is as follows: Dong Liu's wife, female, age 50, originally residing at No. 164 and a half, Shangjian Lane, Tongzhou Road, Hongkou; Zhuang Luo's wife, female, age 44, originally residing on Tiantong An Road; Chen Mingsong, male, age 14, originally residing at No. 28 Saisan Road; Gu Lu Jinbao, female, age 24, originally residing in the middle of Saisan Road Zhongshan Road; Zheng Lu's wife, female, age 41, originally residing at the entrance of the China Public School, Wusong; Peng Amei, female, age 15, originally residing at the Wusong Yarn Factory; Xu Wu Xiao, female, age 17, originally residing at the Wusong Yarn Factory; Yang Wu's wife, female, age 24, originally residing in the countryside under the bridge of Xisai Xing Road Gongxing Road; Jin Dada, male, age 52, originally residing at No. 242 Zhongxing Road.</p>
<p>Investigation of Red Cross Wounded Soldier Hospitals: The Chinese Red Cross Society Wounded Soldier Hospital has now established many branches. The general patriotic public initially did not know about the various branches, so they gathered at Haig Road to donate comfort items, while other places were in great need. In order to facilitate the donation of items and nearby visits, the reporter has specifically recorded the wounded soldier hospitals as follows: 1. General Hospital, Haig Road; 2. North Municipal Hospital, Xin Zha Road Magan Road; 3. South Municipal Hospital, Sixteen Pavement; 4. Epidemic Hospital, Xizang Road; 5. Sino-German Hospital, Jingansi Road Zhangjiabang; 6.

<p>The Guangci Hospital Gives Preferential Treatment to Chinese Wounded Soldiers: The Catholic priests in this city have been very enthusiastic about rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees this time. The Aurora University has vacated dozens of western-style houses in the western dormitory to accommodate wounded Chinese soldiers. The Guangci Hospital has voluntarily recognized the Chinese Red Swastika Society to take in at least 50 wounded soldiers and fully supply them with beds, food, medical care, and other necessities, completely free of charge. It is now known that more than 20 people have been admitted, and special wards have been set up for wounded officers of the 19th Route Army to show their excellence. This is reserved at the request of the officers. All nursing work is undertaken by Chinese and French nuns from Guangci Hospital. In addition to Chinese doctors who graduated from Aurora University, the doctors also include the famous French doctor Dr. Brugeas. The doctor served as a field doctor during the European War and is rich in experience. Recently, he has performed various important operations to cure many seriously wounded soldiers. Chinese people who go to the hospital for consolation every day are endless. They all give warm comfort to the wounded soldiers and give gifts. Yesterday, the commander of the French Navy in Shanghai also sent a representative to express his sympathy to the loyal and brave soldiers of the injured 19th Route Army.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Donations from All Walks of Life to Red Cross Hospitals: The Chinese Red Cross Society Fifth Wounded Soldier Hospital and Sixth Rescue Detachment are jointly organized by Tongji University and the Sino-German Hospital. The hospital is located at No. 6 Zhangjiabang, Jingansi Road. Since its opening on February 1, the hospital has rescued wounded soldiers from the front line every day. There are quite a few of them, and they are all being treated in the hospital. People from all walks of life go to donate every day, and they are overwhelmed with donations. Wuzhou Amusement Park, 5 items, Chaozhou Tongji Association, 6 items, Qin Lansheng, 2 cotton quilts, Peng Naiwen, 10 items, Zhu Weichu, 10 hot water bottles, Social Bureau, 13 items, Gu Zhaolin, 50 dan of rice, Li Residence, 9 old clothes, Shanghai Women's Comforting and Defending Soldiers Society, 60 pillows, 8 sets of cotton shirts and trousers, Red Cross Society General Hospital, 40 blankets, Mrs. Chen, 54 cotton quilts, 4 sheets, Shanghai Chinese and Western Women's Comforting Wounded Soldiers Society, 80 blankets, 28 sheets, and many items, miscellaneous items, Free Farm, 10 pounds of fresh milk every day for 10 days, Women's Comforting and Defending Soldiers Association, 20 mattresses, 9 shirts, 10 trousers, Huasheng Company, 20 dozen bottles of beef juice, Nanjing Road Business Association, 50 pounds of fresh milk, Wang Wangong, 40 sheets, Yi Datongren, 200 blankets, 103 hot water bottles, Xu Yushen, 200 clothes hooks, Ye Mansion, 40 sheets, 48 mattresses, Chinese and Western Women's Comforting Wounded Soldiers Association, 30 pillows, Yuan Da Zhuang equipment, worth 92 yuan. The above is to prevent omissions, and cannot be fully recorded. There are still many donations of cash, and it is said that after collecting them, a notice will be published to express gratitude. However, recently there are too many food items among the comfort items, which is very harmful to the digestion of the wounded soldiers. It is best for all circles to donate more iron beds, bedding, clothes, and music items in the future, because the hospital also intends to expand the hospital address, and is in need of consistent use of equipment. It is hoped that all circles will pay attention.</p>
<p>The Chinese Business Company Relieves Refugees: The Chinese Business Company will use two large houses located on Chengdu Road to accommodate refugees from disaster areas. This newspaper has previously disclosed this. It is now learned that the company's general manager, Mr. Lu Deli, and director, Mr. Lin Yuting, in view of the fact that the refugees are suffering from hunger and cold, have launched a donation campaign to the Chinese and Western employees of the company. It is reported that they have donated 3,000 yuan, which is intended to be handed over to the Chinese Red Cross Society for the specific purpose of relieving refugees.</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan Sends Off Fellow Townsmen: The owner of the Tianchan Stage, Yuan Zhuxuan, first compiled the stage into the Second Shelter of the Red Cross, donated his own car as an ambulance, prepared condolences for the soldiers on the front line, and inquired about the wounded soldiers in various hospitals. Recently, at the request of the Shanghai Municipal and Local Maintenance Committee, he took on the responsibility of sending back to Jiangbei the fellow villagers who were in distress, recognizing Nantong as the local point for the funeral. He sent people to survey, and at the same time set up an office at the Tianchan Stage to allow the fellow villagers in distress to register and contact them.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts Continue to Work: The Municipal</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts were dispatched by the Red Cross Society to rush to the front line to rescue refugees, resulting in the loss of four members. Although repeated negotiations with the Japanese headquarters have been made, there are still no results. Recently, it was learned that the Japanese army intends to release the second batch of captured people. The head of the regiment is trying to investigate as soon as possible. It is not known whether there is hope of release. In addition, the regiment has recently established a stretcher team, which will be sent to the front line to rescue wounded soldiers as soon as the equipment is purchased. The original rescue team is still cooperating with the Red Cross Society and continuing to be dispatched to the war zone to carry out work such as rescuing soldiers and refugees. The progress is very hard.</p>
<p>Fujian Refugees Leave Shanghai: Yesterday, commercial ships sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo still included the Xunning Shao, Songpu, and Xing Shi, etc., and the passengers were still full. However, there were few passengers on Taikoo's Xin Beijing ship. The overseas Chinese in Shanghai have returned to their hometowns in the past two decades, and few have remained. However, there are still many fellow Fujianese. Yesterday, it was confirmed that the temporary ships in the Ningbo class, in response to the requirements of the Min people, have been mostly changed to open to Quanzhou and other places in Fujian, starting today, to carry Min people back to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Sending Refugees Back to Dinghai: Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the Dinghai Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, and Chen Yiting, Vice-Chairman, rescued more than 1,000 refugees in the Zhabei area a few days ago.

The ship returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday after being sent to Dinghai, and transported more than 800 refugees to Dinghai yesterday (19th).</p>

They also rescued a wounded civilian, Zhu Xianggen, age 58, from Chongming, whose left leg had been broken by a cannonball. The rescue team members personally used a car to transport him to the Swastika Society Second Hospital for treatment. Another truck was prepared to transport refugees to their relatives in the concession. The team also turned to the front lines in Zhenru and other places to investigate whether there were any wounded soldiers. When they arrived at the front line, our army was quiet and there were no injuries or damage. So they returned to the meeting in the original car. On the way, they encountered four refugees, men and women, old and young, who were originally engaged in the fish business. They only escaped this morning and were crying by the roadside. The association took them to the Fourth Shelter of the Baker Road for accommodation. In addition, the association, in view of the fact that the various shelters in this city have been suffering from overcrowding, has used small ships to transport refugees from Suxi Changzhen Liyang Kunshan Taicang and other places in batches without exhaustion. Several batches have been shipped out. Yesterday, it was heard that the association transported more than 1,200 refugees to Wuxi. Today, it will continue to transport more than 700 refugees to Wuxi, including 276 people from the Fourth Shelter of the Baker Road. When leaving, an unknown Mrs. A, a former neighbor of the shelter, saw the tragic situation of the general women and children and gave each person one yuan. Like Mrs. A, it can be said that she is familiar with Zishan.</p>

<p>Hurry, All Sectors Help Make Elephant Trunk Shaped Masks for Child Soldiers</p>
<p>Since the Child Soldier Battlefield Service Corps, on behalf of the 19th Route Army, began appealing for donations of gas masks, support has been extremely enthusiastic for a time. However, gas is such a thing that not only should breathing be protected, but also the skin, shoulders, and eyeballs suffer severely upon contact. Therefore, it is best to help with German-style elephant trunk-shaped masks with lenses. The method of making them and the necessary supplies can be inquired at the Chamber of Commerce, which will surely provide detailed information. As for single-layer gauze masks, please do not make them anymore.</p>
<p>The Front Needs Shirts and Trousers. According to a report from the Shangyi Troupe, the front lines desperately need shirts and trousers. They have now purchased 30 bolts of natural-colored factory cloth and plan to make 300 sets of shirts and trousers (each set costing about one yuan). Wang Jinji Clothing Store has volunteered to make 100 sets, and the remaining 200 sets will be distributed to the troupe members to make quickly. However, the front lines have a huge need for these shirts and trousers, and we hope that all sectors will cooperate and divide the work.</p>
<p>The Front Needs Food. It has been about 20 days since the 19th Route Army began resisting the enemy, and the items donated by various sectors have been diverse. However, perishable items such as bread, biscuits, and fruits are mostly spoiled and wasted. Please stop donating these. According to a member of the Red Cross rescue team, a soldier stationed on the battlefield said that the canned food donated by various sectors is mostly not very suitable. This is because we do not have time to gather and eat during battle, and it is very difficult to use it as side dishes. Last year, when we were suppressing the communists in Jiangxi, the canned food sent by various sectors, such as fish, meat, and vegetables, was very suitable for us to use as side dishes at any time. In particular, a type of whitebait was loved by every one of our brothers, and it could be stored for a long time without spoiling and was easy to carry. Please, sir, tell all sectors that it would be better to send this kind of fish rather than other food; that would be very welcome.</p>
<p>Frontline Soldiers Urgently Need Bedding and Iron Beds. For the past two weeks, the soldiers on the front lines have been working hard to kill the enemy, and the weather is extremely cold at night. The National Crisis Soldier慰劳 and Rescue Association is urgently seeking the following items to慰劳 the soldiers on the front lines who are fighting the enemy: 1) 500 small pillows; 2) 200 iron beds; 3) 500 quilts. These items are urgently needed. If any enthusiastic people are willing to donate, please send them to the National Crisis Soldier慰劳 and Rescue Association inside the Jianghai Customs Supervisor's Office on Xinzha Road for collection and forwarding.</p>
<p>U.S. Navy Officer Donates 100 Yuan. A U.S. Navy officer named J. H. Bruesch recently donated 100 yuan in cash to the Women's慰劳 Soldiers Association, which proves that foreign friends are expressing sympathy for China and supporting China's just war of self-defense. The money will be used to support our wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Ren She Donates Two Vehicles. The headquarters of the 61st Division received a蓬蓬车 and a freight truck from the Ren She Relief Committee to慰劳 this division. The information is being published to express gratitude.</p>
<p>Fruit Vendor慰劳 Wounded Soldiers. On the morning of the 18th, a man in tattered clothes came to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road to see the director. The hospital staff refused to let him in, but he declared that he was a fruit vendor named Xiaojiangbei from Jiangbei. Seeing the 19th Route Army sacrificing for the country, he took out his savings of about 40 yuan to buy a box of tangerines to慰劳 the wounded soldiers. The hospital staff suspected that he was a Japanese spy and that the tangerines might contain poison, so they did not dare let the wounded soldiers try them. Xiaojiangbei immediately ate one himself to show that there was nothing wrong. A doctor and a nurse each ate one as well. Then, the doctors accompanied him to the beds of the wounded soldiers and gave each person two tangerines. Some wounded soldiers thanked him verbally, while those who could not speak bowed to thank him. When he reached an officer's bed, the officer offered to pay him, but Xiaojiangbei firmly refused. He said that he sells fruit for one yuan a day and can make a profit of 40 cents, so even if he sacrifices his years of hard work, he will not have to worry about food and clothing. Later, he saw an old wounded soldier who looked very pitiful. In addition to giving him two tangerines, he also gave him the two yuan he had set aside for transportation. The old man was moved to tears. A Westerner was present and was puzzled. After the doctor explained, the Westerner praised and applauded. Xiaojiangbei is just a poor vendor, yet he can be so enthusiastic and make such sacrifices, while those who live in comfort and honor turn a blind eye. Shouldn't they be ashamed to death? Why not follow Xiaojiangbei's example, quickly rise up, and work together? Then, perhaps our country will have hope.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Enthusiastically Donate. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union launched a donation campaign for military expenses the other day.

It is also reported that the Kaifeng Postal Workers' Union donated 200 yuan to the 19th Route Army, which was also transferred by the Zhengzhou Postal Workers' Union along with the previous donation.

<h3 id="e22">The Bureau of Public Works Does Not Allow the Separate Formation of a Japanese Fire Brigade <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The information office of the Bureau of Public Works released a statement saying that Lin Xiongji, chairman of the Joint Association of Japanese Business Circles in this port, recently requested the Bureau of Public Works to allow the separate formation of a fire brigade in the Hongkou district during the current emergency, with members being Japanese volunteers. Yesterday, the Bureau of Public Works replied that it would not grant the request. The letter stated: "The matter of your request has been carefully considered in light of the following points: Modern firefighting and fire prevention have become specialized professions. The equipment used is very complex and expensive. Therefore, it cannot be handled without specialized skills and long-term hard training. Even the current firefighters of the Bureau of Public Works practice more than 200 times a year, each time requiring an hour or more. Even the most basic training requires a lot of time. Moreover, the duties, equipment, and personnel of the existing fire brigade are all based on the needs of the entire concession. If another one is formed, it will be very difficult to coordinate. Furthermore, the fire station in the Hongkou district has about one-sixth of the strength of the entire concession, which is not weak. Moreover, if necessary, it can still be assisted by other districts. Therefore, the bureau believes that the full force of the current fire brigade is sufficient to meet the needs of the entire concession, including Hongkou." The Bureau of Public Works expressed its appreciation for Mr. Lin's willingness to assist, but in view of the current situation, the bureau does not wish to approve the formation of this volunteer fire brigade.</p>
<h3 id="e23">The Bureau of Public Works Will Still Collect This Year's Police Donation <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>at 14 Percent.</p>
<p>At the meeting of the board of directors of the Bureau of Public Works on February 17, the finance director reported that due to the emergency situation, the income from donations and taxes this month was only one-quarter of the due amount. Recently, someone attempted to incite Chinese people not to pay municipal donations. This matter has been dealt with in a timely manner by the general office and the police department. Therefore, on the 18th, special donation collectors were sent out to collect the donations. However, the method of collection was not forced. The reason is that many people are really unable to pay at this time. Some Chinese people paid donations with Qianzhuang tickets, and when the Western banks went to collect the money, difficulties arose because some Qianzhuangs recently established a new type of restriction measure. From the current point of view, the future of donations and taxes is difficult to predict. However, it is hoped that an investigation can be made soon of the areas where donations cannot be collected, and the losses from this donation amount can be partially offset by the increased donation amount from people who have sought refuge in other areas. Last September, the director made a complete plan for this year's finances. At that time, it was already pointed out that if there were any accidents that made it impossible to increase donations this year or next year, emergency measures would have to be taken. After this incident, the director, in view of the huge commercial losses, believed that if donations were increased, even if only by two percent, it would be unfair to the citizens. Therefore, a temporary measure was decided upon, which is to calculate the budget to be submitted in 1932 based on a 14 percent municipal donation. If there had not been this incident, it would have been reasonable to increase it to 16 percent. For this year, the expenditure on certain projects cannot but be reduced again, and in order to maintain the balance of the budget, some expenditures will have to be classified as temporary expenses instead of being paid from the donation item. If the emergency expenditures are also handled in this way, it may be possible to maintain the balance of the budget with a donation amount of 14 percent. Therefore, it seems inevitable to hold a bond offering early, but it is not appropriate to take this action until the situation is clearer in the future. Therefore, the director plans to wait a little longer before proposing a solution to deal with emergency expenditures, or may need to ask a certain bank to assist until a bond offering can be held.</p>
<p>Regarding emergency expenditures, it is difficult to predict the number at this time, but the director is in constant contact with the recently established committees. The chairmen of the committees are also willing to cooperate, so they can still carefully examine these expenditures. As for the food expenses of the business groups and special police, the initial amount was 10,400 yuan per day. Now that most of the business group members have been demobilized and the rations have been reduced, the daily cost is only 2,100 yuan.</p>

<p>Already Obtained Approval from the American Government</p>
<p>It has been found that the regulations stipulated in the loan purchase of relief wheat contract signed with the American government specify that the use of this relief wheat is limited to disaster relief and must not be used for other purposes. The National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee felt that transporting a large amount of relief wheat to remote disaster areas in the inland was extremely difficult. After consultation with the American authorities, it was agreed to exchange a portion of the relief wheat in Shanghai for other kinds of food stored in inland commercial ports. This method could save on transportation procedures and can be considered perfect. Now, according to Sir Simpson, the Director of the Relief Committee's General Office, the committee currently lacks personnel to handle the food. Furthermore, there is no large amount of food available in the inland areas along the upper reaches of the Han River. Even in inland commercial ports, purchasing a large amount of food each time would inevitably cause prices to rise. It would be better to distribute relief funds to the disaster victims and let them purchase food in small quantities themselves. If food prices continue to rise, the committee can continue to purchase food from abroad, and the prices will naturally stabilize. Recently, the committee has obtained the approval of the American government to sell off a portion of the relief wheat, and all the proceeds will be allocated to inland disaster areas, specifically for disaster relief, striving to ensure that the disaster-stricken people receive tangible benefits, it is said.</p>

<p>It is reported by sources at the local post office that, according to regulations, all postal items that cannot be delivered or are not claimed at the post office after two weeks should be returned to the sender. However, due to the special circumstances of the current situation, special arrangements are being made. The Shanghai Postal Administration has issued a notice stating: "Due to the current situation, ordinary registered and express mail addressed to areas north of Sichuan Road, Zhabei, and west of the Hongkou Zhao Feng Road cannot be delivered and will instead be stored at the Management Bureau for collection. Ordinary mail will be held at the package delivery office, while registered and express mail will be held at the business office on the second floor. Merchants and residents living in the above-mentioned areas can inquire and collect their mail at the Management Bureau every day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM (Sundays from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM)." It is also reported that starting from the 18th of this month, the office hours of most branch post offices in this city will be changed to 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, or 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, it is said.</p>

<p>Suggestion from the City Chamber of Commerce to Issue Substitute Coupons</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chaozhou Sojourners Association National Salvation Committee sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce, stating: "We are writing to you regarding the proposal by Mr. Liu Suijiu, as reported in the newspapers, to request property owners in the city to donate one month's rent to aid the military.

We propose that your chamber convene a meeting of trade associations to resolve this issue, and then issue substitute coupons to each tenant, allowing them to pay one month's rent with the coupons. The coupons can then be exchanged for cash to aid the military. We hereby submit this letter for your consideration and possible adoption."

<p>People from All Walks of Life Should Not Be Fooled by Scoundrels</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident occurred, various public organizations in this city have established formal fundraising agencies to either慰労 the soldiers or aid the refugees. In addition, various newspapers are also collecting donations and慰勞 items on behalf of the public. However, recently, there have still been groups of three to five people carrying donation竹筒 and knocking on doors to solicit donations. Yesterday, we even saw six or seven teenagers with armbands reading "Shanghai Youth Autonomous National Salvation Corps" soliciting donations in the Marlborough area. Regardless of whether they are sincere or not, allowing such private organizations to solicit donations outside the designated channels can easily lead to abuses and should be prohibited.</p>

<p>Already No Less Than Five or Six Hundred</p>
<p>Afraid They Contain Dangerous Items Mixed into the Concession</p>
<p>The Japanese are disrupting our rear and resorting to all sorts of cunning tricks. According to reports yesterday, Japanese plainclothes agents in the area of Jiashan Road and Huishan Wharf in Hongkou are stopping pedicabs on the road, driving away the drivers, forcibly seizing the vehicles, placing them on flatbed cars parked on the side of the road, and sending them to the Japanese headquarters. At the same time, they are searching various alleys and seizing any empty vehicles they find parked there for their own use. From the night before last until yesterday, they have seized no less than five or six hundred pedicabs. According to general speculation, in addition to using them to transport military supplies, the Japanese may also be using plainclothes agents or Chinese traitors to place dangerous items in the cabs and sneak them into the concession, causing trouble for residents in the city. This must be guarded against.</p>

It is said that the foreign general manager was very understanding and has given written approval to the Chinese staff's request. Therefore, they are now working quietly as usual, it is said.</p>

<p>Donating Money and Saving Victims Spare No Effort</p>
<p>Since the Japanese bandits invaded our territory, all the Chinese officials of the General Bureau of Customs and the Jianghai Customs in this city have been filled with righteous indignation and have been eager to provide practical assistance to the soldiers on the front lines and rescue the refugees. They have also organized a special committee to work hard to serve the country and society. Here are some of the most important achievements: (1) At the beginning of the Shanghai Incident, customs officials voluntarily donated money, raising over 5,000 yuan in cash in one day, which has been handed over to the Bank Association in three batches to慰劳 the 19th Route Army. (2) A telegram was sent to Chinese customs officials across the country to wire donations. A batch from Tianjin Customs has already been received, totaling 1,010 yuan. Donations from other customs offices will be delivered within the next few days. It is expected that tens of thousands of yuan can be raised in the shortest period of time. This amount will be used to pay for military expenses for the soldiers on the front lines. (3) In the war zone of North Sichuan Road in Hongkou, there are many compatriots who have not been able to evacuate and are trapped and waiting to die. In recent days, customs officials have obtained passports from the Japanese headquarters, risking their lives to enter and exit the northern district to rescue the trapped compatriots. It is estimated that over hundreds of men and women have been rescued. (4) The Customs Club on Jing'an Temple Road has been opened as a temporary shelter to accommodate over 300 customs officials and their family members who are seeking refuge. The club has appointed dedicated personnel to manage food, hygiene, and order. (5) Five to six hundred pieces of old cotton clothing have been donated, and committee members have personally taken them to various refugee shelters for distribution. (6) A batch of clothing, gloves, and woolen socks to慰劳 wounded soldiers has been sent to the Social Affairs Bureau for distribution. (7) Liang Rong, Xu Zhongyang, Ling Chiheng, Liang Zhiduan, Mrs. and others initiated the production of silk cotton vests for the soldiers on the front lines and personally raised 733.4 yuan in donations from various customs officials. They worked day and night to make a total of 313 silk cotton vests, which were delivered to the 19th Route Army Office yesterday. (8) Twenty customs officials, with the approval of the authorities, have served as interpreters for the British and American defense forces in the concession to maintain order. They have temporarily returned to their customs duties due to the busy customs affairs.</p>

<p>It has been reported in recent days that the Japanese are using coolies from Northern Jiangsu as plainclothes agents and spies to cause trouble everywhere, which is affecting public security. It is deeply inconvenient for the uneducated people of Northern Jiangsu to reside in Shanghai. In view of this, the City People's Maintenance Association has contacted leaders of fellow Jiangsu provincials to send those who reside in Shanghai without fixed employment back to their hometowns in order to prevent them from being exploited by the enemy. It is said that more than 5,000 people have been sent back to their hometowns.</p>

<p>祁瑞君, the captain of the seventh team of the Chinese Red Cross Battlefield Rescue Team, was killed by Japanese soldiers. The association held a funeral ceremony for Mr. Liu at the Wanguo Cemetery on Hongqiao Road the afternoon before last at 2:30 PM to慰劳 his loyalty and bravery in sacrificing himself for the country. One thing that should be added is that from Xinza Road to Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, at every major road intersection in the public concession, foreign military police and Chinese police officers saluted with their guns when they saw the coffin covered with the Red Cross flag. Another American soldier, who was riding a motorcycle on the road, specifically stopped his vehicle, raised his hand, and expressed his sincere respect to the coffin of Mr. Liu. According to international conventions, when countries unfortunately go to war, they should respect the Red Cross rescue team and not treat them as enemies. Liu Qirui was brutally killed, and the Japanese army has lost its position as a civilized army, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e35">After Japan Presented a Ultimatum, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issued a Declaration <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Stating the Atrocities of the Japanese Army in Shanghai</p>
<p>Our Troops Resisted for Self-Defense</p>
<p>Unable to Accept Unreasonable Demands</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese side issued an ultimatum to the Shanghai local authorities and the garrison on the 18th, which not only greatly stimulated the people of our country but also challenged a member state of the League of Nations. In addition to ordering the military and political authorities in Shanghai to sternly reject the ultimatum, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a declaration stating the atrocities of the Japanese army in Shanghai and the process of our garrison resisting for self-defense. In order to maintain the sovereignty and honor of our independent nation and strive for the survival of the Chinese nation, we cannot accept the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side. The declaration is expected to be released in Shanghai tonight. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a declaration at 7:00 PM on the 19th, stating: "The Japanese troops in Shanghai have been using various weapons of war to continuously bombard the Zhabei and Wusong areas for two weeks, causing huge losses to the lives and property of countless innocent Chinese people. As if this were not enough, at 8:45 PM on the 18th, their commander, Ueda, sent an ultimatum to Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 19th Route Army of our country, demanding that the Chinese troops completely withdraw from their current defense line to a distance of 20 kilometers east and west of the public concession before 5:00 PM on the 20th of this month, and that all fortresses and other military facilities within the withdrawn area be permanently dismantled. At the same time, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Murai, sent a similar ultimatum to Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai. The Japanese government has always declared its intention to maintain peace between China and Japan, and under Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, it has also promised to respect and preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of all member states of the League of Nations. Recently, the Council of the League of Nations also sent a request to Japan, advising it to take moderate action towards China. However, Japan has unexpectedly made such excessive demands, which not only pose a major threat to the Chinese people but also directly challenge the authority of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and other international agreements. Such demands endanger China's sovereignty and national integrity, and no matter what sincerity the local authorities in China may have in avoiding bloodshed, they must absolutely not accept them. Relying on its numerous reinforcements and the latest weapons, the Japanese army is about to engage in a large-scale and even more brutal attack. It turns a deaf ear to all calls for peace, and its only determination is to fight. In order to defend Chinese territory, the Chinese garrison in Shanghai has no choice but to engage in self-defense to the end." (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses the Japanese Ultimatum</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Arrives in Nanjing to Participate in the Discussion</p>
<p>The Talks of Luo Wen'gan and Shen Jin Ding</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wen'gan met with reporters at noon on the 19th and said that this morning, at Wang's invitation, he and Shen Jin Ding, Director of the Asia Department, went to Puzhen to discuss the Shanghai situation and returned to the city. Wang also came and will hold a meeting to study diplomatic events. Previously, organizations in the capital had requested the ministry to submit 15 articles to the League of Nations. The ministry had already ordered representative Yan to submit them, but due to the considerable amount of research required by various countries, it took a little longer. It has now been formally submitted to the General Assembly. Yan is also striving to stop Japanese atrocities at the Disarmament Conference. The League of Nations has recently submitted a warning, which is serious in its wording. Friendly countries are paying close attention to the Shanghai situation. The government previously declared that it would not recognize a partial solution, but in view of the ardent hopes of friendly countries, it will allow them to discuss solutions. However, after the Chinese and Japanese representatives met yesterday, the conditions proposed by the Japanese side were unacceptable to us. The government is currently considering the matter. Furthermore, Japan is using the concession as a base of operations, and in addition to our protests, Britain and France have also protested to Japan. Japan is still using the concession for combat, ignoring the protests. The public opinion of all countries is paying close attention. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shen Jin Ding, Director of the Asia Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a reception for reporters hosted by Foreign Minister Luo on the morning of the 19th that after Japan presented the ultimatum to the 19th Route Army, the central government, after receiving the report, immediately convened the Foreign Affairs Committee on the evening of the 18th and discussed the matter for a long time. The meeting continued on the morning of the 19th and decided everything. The conditions proposed by the Japanese side are not only unacceptable to the 19th Route Army, but also unacceptable to the government and the people. Shen replied to reporters that the method of sending the reply to the Japanese ultimatum is still under study, but it is expected to be sent out soon. Japan is prone to using gunboat diplomacy in various places and does not follow proper diplomatic channels to submit its demands, which is very inappropriate. Shen continued that although the League of Nations has expressed sympathy for us, and representative Yan has struggled in the meeting based on previous ministry orders, the League of Nations only recently submitted a more stern warning to Japan. The notable point of this warning is that all previous statements issued by the League of Nations were directed at both China and Japan, but this time it is only directed at Japan, which shows that the Japanese atrocities have been jointly condemned by the world. However, the League of Nations is organized by member states, and its strength depends on the public opinion of each member state. Whether it can take a very effective measure to truly punish Japanese atrocities can be glimpsed from past situations. As for the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, although they are also deeply indignant at Japan, it is not certain whether they can urge Japan to be fully responsible for the signed treaties. Therefore, on the one hand, our loyal soldiers are actively resisting in legitimate self-defense, and on the other hand, we are still relying on diplomatic tactics to cope with the situation. However, external forces cannot be relied on, and the whole country must work together and never make the mistakes of the past. On the one hand, we must preserve the honor of the country, and on the other hand, we must focus on the current strength of the country to support this crisis. In this critical moment of national crisis, it is not enough to simply sing high-sounding slogans, nor can it be solved by the criticism of a certain faction. What is hoped is that the whole country will be united and single-minded to overcome this difficulty. (19th Dispatch) (Xuzhou) Feng's illness has subsided, but he still needs to rest. Li Xingzhong has been sent to Nanjing on the Pingpu train on the evening of the 18th to meet with Wang and Jiang and participate in the diplomatic discussions. Feng will determine the date of his departure after his health has fully recovered. Feng's wife, Li Dequan, came to Xuzhou from Jin on the 18th to visit Feng and inquire about his health. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Reuters representative visited Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei this afternoon. It is said that the National Government's reply to the Japanese ultimatum has been issued, containing the following five points: (1) Both Chinese and Japanese troops will withdraw, without specifying the distance. This is still acceptable, but the National Government will never accept the demand that Chinese troops withdraw alone. (2) Anti-Japanese activities will be dealt with in accordance with the law. However, freedom of speech and publication are guaranteed by law and cannot be interfered with. If anti-Japanese activities go beyond the scope of the law, they will be dealt with according to national law. (3) Any suggestion to dismantle national defenses cannot be accepted. (4) China does not normally station troops in the Shanghai area. Once the situation in the area returns to normal, it will still be patrolled by Chinese police. (5) The demand for Japanese aircraft to monitor the withdrawal of Chinese troops cannot be accepted. If monitors are absolutely necessary, they should be appointed from neutral countries on a third side and not by the Japanese. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo told people this morning that the Chinese government's reply to the ultimatum will be sent to the Japanese authorities tonight. Luo also said that the government has instructed representative Yan to invoke Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant at the special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly. (Article 15 stipulates that member states of the League of Nations have the right to take such action as they deem necessary to maintain their rights and justice). The government's special Foreign Affairs Committee met in Puzhen last night and did not end until 3:00 AM. The meeting resumed after more than three hours, and the Foreign Affairs Committee crossed the river to Nanjing this morning and held another meeting in the morning. Wang Jingwei and Luo Wen'gan both attended. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, the demands of Japan are unacceptable and the Chinese reply will reject them. The wording of the reply has not yet been finalized, but it will be drafted by the Foreign Affairs Committee today. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government received a telegram from Chen Mingshu stating that the Chinese and Japanese representatives met this morning, but the Japanese attitude was very firm, so the meeting ended without satisfactory results. It also said that the defense of the front has been fully arranged and the morale of our troops is extremely high. The political and civilian circles were relieved to hear the news that the peace talks had broken down. The Chinese people are not warlike, nor are they unaware of the horrors of war, but they believe that such horrors can achieve beneficial results, namely, to awaken the whole country and unite to resist foreign aggression, and to avoid civil war from now on. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei crossed the river from Pukou to Nanjing today to discuss the demands of the Japanese army in Shanghai for an ultimatum. The reply was discussed by the Foreign Affairs Committee until late last night. It is now waiting for his approval before being telegraphed to Shanghai. When Wang was crossing the river, Luo Wen'gan told people that the demands of the Japanese were completely unacceptable to the Chinese people, and the nature of the reply can be seen from this. It is expected that the reply will be sent to the Japanese side tonight. Subsequently, Luo met with reporters and stressed that the Japanese demands were unacceptable and criticized the Japanese army for still using the public租界 as a combat base. He also said that although the government was making every effort to oppose the separate resolution of the Northeast issue and the Shanghai issue, it was not unwilling to accept mediation from various groups, first to cease fire in Shanghai to avoid greater sacrifices for the people. In addition, the government spokesperson stated today that China no longer has much hope for the League of Nations and the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and deeply knows that only self-help can relieve the national crisis. The recent note from the Council of the League of Nations to the Japanese government is sufficient to represent the ability of the League of Nations. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Twelve Council Members Held Secret Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Legal Scholars Deem Application Legitimate</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yen Hui-ching, China's chief delegate to the League of Nations, upon receiving grave news from Shanghai regarding the Japanese ultimatum to General Cai Tingkai, has specifically requested the Administrative Council to convene a special meeting tomorrow. Dr. Yen stated that a great disaster is imminent and intends to request the Administrative Council to find a way to avert it. League of Nations legal scholars have spent the entire day considering the legal points of Japan's opposition to China's proposal to convene a special council meeting. It is said that China's application is deemed legitimate. The League of Nations Secretariat estimates that the special council meeting could be held on March 1st. If Japan requests a postponement to send a special envoy to attend, it would have to be delayed by two weeks. The Japanese delegation issued a statement tonight, saying that the majority of Chinese in Shanghai and many foreigners wish the 19th Route Army to leave Shanghai, as their attitude is very dangerous. The statement further claims that many communists are within the army, and the National Government originally intended to disband them but now has them stationed around Shanghai, isolating them to observe their movements. (Reuters telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond has, in response to China's request, distributed a telegram from Shanghai to all members of the Administrative Council. According to the telegram, the foreign business community in Shanghai had submitted a petition for a truce before the offensive military action commenced, and negotiations began based on the following conditions: both parties would withdraw their troops, and the police affairs in the withdrawn area would be handled by neutral forces. The telegram also cited a declaration issued by the mayor, stating that China is prepared to negotiate based on the five-point proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. If Japan is unwilling to accept, then its intention to invade China will be completely exposed. If such hostile actions are not stopped, it is entirely due to Japan's refusal of all friendly and fair proposals from neutral countries. The whole world must know this, the telegram concludes.

<p>(Geneva) At the beginning of today's meeting of the twelve Administrative Council members, Chairman Pung Ku announced that the legal objections raised by Japan against China's request for the League of Nations Assembly to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute had been studied by legal scholars and unanimously rejected. Thereupon, the twelve members discussed whether the Administrative Council should still have the authority to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute, given that China had invoked Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant and applied to convene a special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly. It was subsequently decided to hold a public meeting of the Administrative Council at 5:30 PM today. (Reuters telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to today's news, the military authorities here are currently observing the developments in the Shanghai incident. If necessary, they will dispatch reinforcements again. At that time, the Ministry of the Army will specially appoint a commander-in-chief. It is reported that Army Minister Araki recently told reporters that the 19th Route Army, hearing that it has received the assistance of fresh troops, will stubbornly resist. Therefore, Japan may need to dispatch reinforcements to Shanghai again. People in Tokyo are now confident that the government has adopted various methods to quickly deal with any eventuality.

<p>Secretary of State for War Reports Government Policy</p>
<p>Better to Use Gentle Methods</p>
<p>Than Intimidation</p>
<h3 id="e38">London: The British Upper House discussed the Shanghai situation today. <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Labour Party member Ponsonby said that the Japanese military clique is currently temporarily in control of the government and is concealing the facts, preventing their people from knowing the truth. However, the proper public sentiment within Japan may still exist and can be appealed to. He hopes that the major powers will not negotiate with the Japanese government using a policy of allowing Japan freedom of action in Manchuria as an exchange for Japan abandoning its current situation in Shanghai. If the League of Nations truly wants to demonstrate its readiness to punish any country that violates its treaties, he especially hopes that Britain will take the lead. Secretary of State for War Hailsham replied that the British government is extremely concerned about the Shanghai situation. The authorities of various countries in Shanghai are now cooperating. The British government has always been in close contact with the League of Nations, the United States, and other countries. It would be a miscalculation if the British government's actions seemed to be cooperating only with the United States, resembling opposition to other countries of the League of Nations. The British government is striving to maintain friendly contact with the United States while still fulfilling its duties to the League of Nations and seeking cooperation between the entire League of Nations and the United States. The proposal put forward by Lord Ponsonby to automatically implement the economic sanctions of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant is an extremely dangerous and inappropriate method because this action involves the question that the League of Nations Administrative Council must decide, which is which country is responsible for receiving this kind of punishment. If we follow Lord Ponsonby's proposal, regardless of declaring that Britain believes that Japan has committed the crime of waging war against another country of the League of Nations, this is not a way to limit the area of hostile actions. If necessary, the evacuation of British citizens from Shanghai must be considered, but this matter is very difficult and extremely harmful. It is still doubtful whether many British citizens are willing to leave Shanghai. At present, he does not see any credible reason for this action to be practical or proper. He hopes that a situation will not arise that makes this action necessary. The British government is extremely unwilling to make a hasty judgment and must give both sides an appropriate opportunity to present their case and study the evidence of both sides. The document sent by the League of Nations to Japan did not reprimand Japan, nor did it have the nature of intimidation, but rather was a friendly advice, asking it to do its best to help maintain peace and respect the work of the League of Nations Covenant. The British government will not relax its efforts to seek a peaceful resolution. Before the League of Nations Administrative Council has a full opportunity to study this matter, the British government does not want to express its opinion on who is responsible for the current situation. What the British government is now asking of both China and Japan is based on the fact that both countries are willing to fulfill their obligations. The British government believes that using gentle methods is more likely to achieve the goal of resolving the current situation and protecting British citizens than using intimidation.

<h3 id="e39">London: The British House of Commons today mentioned the deaths of two British sailors in Shanghai who were wounded by stray bullets. Foreign Secretary Simon claimed that the British Ambassador to China has sent a note to the Chinese government, requesting that it strictly order the military authorities to find ways to prevent such incidents from happening again. Simon also said that in this unfortunate war, the British government will hold both sides responsible for any loss of British lives and property caused by the troops of both sides. MP Maxton asked the Foreign Secretary whether he was satisfied with the appropriate steps taken in Shanghai to protect civilians. Simon replied that he dared to say that this was one of the things that the Shanghai authorities were most concerned about. A Labour MP asked whether the Chinese government would be asked to compensate for the deaths of the two sailors. The Foreign Secretary did not answer. The Shanghai situation was then discussed again. Simon said that he learned from newspaper telegrams that the armistice negotiations had failed, which was regrettable. However, this news has not yet been officially confirmed. Simon also briefly stated that Japan had raised legal points regarding China's application to convene a special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly. He hopes that the League of Nations Administrative Council will consider China's application as soon as possible. Opposition leader Gaitskell asked whether British citizens in Shanghai would have to leave the country if the war continued. Simon replied that this matter is currently under careful consideration, but the practical difficulties must be studied locally, so he cannot continue to answer this question.

<p>US Ambassador to Japan Bears a Difficult Task</p>
<p>(Tokyo) People in all circles here anticipate that the task of the new US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, will be the most difficult to accomplish among all US ambassadors abroad. The feelings between Japan and the United States have been strained since the Manchurian Incident. The outbreak of the Shanghai Incident has further exacerbated the rift. The United States has always advocated the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity in Manchuria and other parts of China. Unexpectedly, the door to Manchuria has been virtually closed by Japan. It remains doubtful whether the United States will be able to kick open the closed door again. However, Grew, shouldering this task, is naturally not welcomed by the Japanese. It is possible that the Japanese, considering that they must borrow money in the coming years and that only Americans can absorb their bonds, may be willing to heed Grew's advice due to economic relations.

<p>the major powers of the League of Nations must proceed with great caution in continuing to handle everything, as the situation is now recognized as very tense and fragile, with a hair-trigger atmosphere. Therefore, Prime Minister MacDonald's plan to go abroad for a rest after his illness has been abandoned. General opinion is that without the genuine cooperation of the United States, nothing can be expected to be effective. According to the latest news, the US government's actions are planned to be limited to protecting American lives and property. The Daily News today summarizes the truth of the overall situation as follows: (1) The League of Nations cannot issue warnings to Japan regarding violating international obligations without the firm guarantee of the United States' strength and assistance. (2) Japan will take a more forceful offensive, insisting that it cannot stop its military forces until the local Chinese troops retreat. Negotiations can begin after the Chinese troops retreat, but not before, otherwise its prestige will be damaged. (3) The Chinese troops will not retreat. (4) The League of Nations Administrative Council will submit the entire case to the League of Nations Assembly, and some small countries unrelated to the case will participate in the meeting, perhaps demanding action against Japan. (5) If the League of Nations does not succumb to this demand, then the League of Nations can be said to have failed. (6) If the League of Nations succumbs, it will inevitably lead to war against Japan, and the first to bear the brunt will be the League of Nations' largest naval power, namely Britain. Therefore, Britain will bear most of the manpower and military expenses of a new era of warfare in a dispute that is not its own, opposing its old friends and allies, and will be in a very unfavorable position to resist an enemy with a solid and locally mobilized army. (7) Public opinion is that in this situation, the United States will assist Britain and the League of Nations, but the United States has not given this guarantee, and its aversion to war today is unprecedented, and geographically it is not in the best position to send a large army across the Pacific Ocean to fight in the Chinese seas. (8) The League of Nations may be able to avoid the dangerous consequences of "more forceful action" and preserve itself through wise consultations in London. Furthermore, it must be unanimously approved by the twelve members of the Administrative Council (excluding China and Japan) and supported by the majority of other members of the League of Nations Assembly before an order can be given to implement "sanctions." Or a member of the Administrative Council can avert a great disaster with a dissenting vote. However, the situation in Geneva is particularly worrying to London. (Reuters telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e43">London: British Foreign Secretary Simon originally planned to leave for Geneva today, <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>but was again prevented by events and postponed his departure. This is the fourth time he has wanted to go but ultimately failed to do so. It is reported that the purpose of the Foreign Secretary's return to London is to seek the cabinet's agreement to determine a certain diplomatic policy regarding the Manchurian issue. The reason for repeatedly delaying his return to Geneva is probably that the Foreign Secretary's value is greater in London for discussion. Moreover, the Disarmament Conference currently has little activity because all the French representatives have returned to Paris to deal with the cabinet political crisis, so the British Foreign Secretary does not need to rush to Geneva.

<h3 id="e46">London: Opinions on the Shanghai situation are not entirely the same in all quarters, <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>but all believe that the Shanghai situation cannot be allowed to drag on without resolution. British Foreign Secretary Simon's tactics can be seen in the League of Nations' document, and many call it appropriate, conscious and tranquil, and some call it the result of a sharp legal mind, because before making specific remedies, the scope of evasion is reduced. Some people fear that the convocation of the League of Nations Assembly will have the influence of majority oppression, and this majority of countries has no special understanding or special interests in the Far East, and merely indulging in passionate rhetoric will instead obscure the truth. Others hope that Nanjing will express its willingness to negotiate to resolve this difficult situation and prevent the current combat lull from turning into hostile actions again. The London Morning Post and Daily Mail are both opposed to Britain participating in the vortex of the Sino-Japanese conflict, citing the harm Britain has suffered from Chinese boycotts. However, the tone of most British newspapers is that there is a demand for strict Japanese tactics. Even newspapers that were formerly friendly to Japan have gradually expressed sympathy towards China since Japan used Shanghai as a base for sending troops, such as The Times. The Times said that Japan should indeed be given greater satisfaction than China is prepared to give, but Japan's distrust of the League of Nations and its adoption of terrorist methods have caused it to lose sympathy, which is a pity for commentators. Japan, especially the Japanese military authorities, would be greatly mistaken if they thought that the comparatively mild protest that has been put forward is the last word of the League of Nations and the powers with a great interest in China, it said. The Times also published a letter signed by prominent British figures such as Cecil and banker Eddis, stating the importance of immediate action, saying that if Japan's military dictatorship in the Far East is recognized, a very dangerous backlash will occur in India and other parts of the British Empire. Britain should seek the cooperation of the United States, and the League of Nations should exert diplomatic and economic pressure to force Japan to respect the collective system of treaty dignity. A Daily Express dispatch from Geneva said that there is now an impression in Geneva that Japan, having gained something in Manchuria, now hopes to repeat the trick in Shanghai. The Daily News said that the United States does not seem to be directly involved in the League of Nations' document to Japan, but it is now solemnly and intently negotiating with Japan to protect the interests of its citizens.

(Harbin) At 3 PM on the 16th, the Northeast New State System Conference was held in the Liaoning Provincial Government Hall. Zang Shiyi chaired the meeting and decided on the general outline. All constitutions and organizations will be decided by the 21 Legislative Yuan meetings. The meeting period is set for one month. Zhao Xinbo was publicly elected as the president of the Legislative Yuan. The attendance of one-third of the heads of various ministries and academies is sufficient for a quorum and can hold meetings. The Supreme Court will first establish the various ministries and academies. The new country will be announced to the outside world at the same time after the constitution is promulgated. At the 16th meeting, it was decided that the new state system would be the Independent Republic of Manchuria and Mongolia, with one executive to be the head of state for life, internally determined to be Puyi. There are four institutes below, and the candidates have been determined: 1. President of the State Council Zang Shiyi, 2. President of the Supervisory Yuan Yu Chonghan, 3.

According to a telegram from Shenyang, the new government has decided to adopt the silver standard as a transition to the future adoption of the gold standard, so it will raise 20 million yuan in Mexican currency as a reserve fund and will issue banknotes by the Central Bank to be established by the council to buy back the old Panyang banknotes at market prices.

<p>(Shenyang) The declaration of independence of the four northeastern provinces is ambiguously worded.

The representatives' questions were answered vaguely, and the most important questions were answered by the Japanese interpreter instead of asking Zhang. The declaration of independence has not yet had an impact in Shenyang, but local foreigners unanimously condemned it, as the Japanese military authorities forced Zhang et al. to do so because the League of Nations investigation team was about to arrive here.

However, those who are generally well-informed guarantee that the United States will not recognize the newly formed government in Manchuria because the United States notified the Japanese government long before the establishment of the new government in the three eastern provinces that the United States could not legally recognize the factual situation in the three eastern provinces. It is now believed that the new government in the three eastern provinces was created by Japanese military force. If other countries conclude treaties with it, it means disregarding the government created by force against the will of the Chinese people.

<h3 id="e67">Japanese Public Opinion on the Shanghai Incident <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Those Advocating Force Insist on an Early Resolution Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports: Former Prime Minister and President of the Minseitō party, Wakatsuki, who was campaigning for the election, passed through Shizuoka and made a special trip to visit Elder Saionji and other elders to report on the serious situation. He then made the following remarks in the train regarding the Shanghai Incident: "I have been campaigning in various places for days, focusing on economic issues. As for the recent diplomatic affairs with China, I really do not want to criticize the current government's policy too much. However, in any case, we should do our best to prevent the expansion of the incident. This kind of unfortunate incident is not only deeply embarrassing for China itself, but also extremely difficult for Japan. Shanghai is a world market, and now the United Kingdom, the United States, and France all hold various anxieties, so we should mediate quickly and hope that the incident will be resolved as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Japanese Public Opinion Advocates Efforts for a Political Solution Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports: Since the Shanghai Incident, the international situation towards Japan has gradually deteriorated. Our government (Japan) is concerned about the attitude of the League of Nations, and although Representative Sato has tried to smooth things over with representatives from Italy and Germany, no concrete results have been achieved. Among them, what our government is most concerned about is that the Shanghai Incident may involve the Manchurian problem and invoke Article 15 together. Therefore, we are striving to transcend legal theory and devote ourselves to a political solution.</p>
<p>Japan Fears Isolation and Does Not Want an Incident The Osaka Asahi Shimbun commentary states: "The situation in Shanghai has made no progress in recent days, and the atmosphere of unease has increased. Our army (Japan) is defending the concession, and in two weeks of combat, it has neither been able to expand the defense line nor been able to avoid the enemy's (our army's) intrusion, ensuring safety. In other words, it has fallen into a situation where it cannot attack and cannot defend. In addition, the countries often show a disdainful attitude towards Japan. Japan will stand in a state of isolation, so we hope that the authorities will quickly resolve the situation to avoid the expansion of the incident."</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Japanese Cabinet Is Shaken by the China Incident <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Opinions of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Are Divided</p>
<p>The Nagoya Shimbun commentary states: "Prime Minister Inukai is deeply concerned about the expansion of the Shanghai Incident and is very worried, hoping to resolve it through diplomatic means. The Shanghai Incident was originally a fundamental policy towards China (according to the reporter, the so-called fundamental policy of Japan is to occupy the entire Chinese area of Shanghai and suppress the anti-Japanese sentiment, so that it can conquer the whole country), but now it has become a world problem. Now the government is emphasizing to other countries that the Shanghai Incident is completely different from the Manchurian problem, because the interests of our country and the position of international relations are very different. Therefore, the government is greatly shaken by the handling of the Shanghai Incident. The fact that Prime Minister Inukai has cancelled his local campaigning and stayed in Tokyo shows that the Shanghai Incident is more important than the election issue. Furthermore, from the conflict between Finance Minister Takahashi's opinion on the Shanghai Incident and the opinions of some cabinet members, as well as Foreign Minister Yoshizawa's request for instructions from Prince Saionji, it is already known to the world that a great upheaval has taken place in the fundamental policy of the current cabinet towards China. At present, the Ministry of Interior is in a state of chaos due to the election, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is even more difficult to deal with because of the Shanghai Incident."</p>
<h3 id="e69">Ding Jixu Leads Guangdong Aircraft to Aid Shanghai <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Entire Second Squadron of Aircraft Departs Ding Leaves a Will Expressing His Determination to Fight to the Death Guangzhou Correspondence: The Shanghai war is becoming increasingly fierce. For the sake of increasing their strength, the 19th Route Army had previously sent special envoys to Guangdong to negotiate with the authorities on the matter of providing military pay and equipment. Recently, a telegram was sent to Guangdong requesting the dispatch of an aircraft squadron to the front lines. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the attitude of the two Guangdong provinces has tended towards unity, expressing a shared desire to face the national crisis. Therefore, the military equipment of the 19th Route Army that had been detained some time ago has been returned in full. Recently, with the enemy sending large squadrons of aircraft as reinforcements, it is felt that our army's air power is still lacking. The local air force authorities have decided to send the entire Second Squadron of aircraft to the front lines to fight. It is reported that the commander of the Second Squadron is Ding Jixu, who is brave and skilled in battle. He studied aviation in Germany and is an outstanding talent in the Guangdong aviation circle. This time, his request to fight the enemy is especially admired by the people of Guangdong. When Ding was about to leave, he left a farewell letter with tragic wording, which is even more inspiring to the younger generation. The letter reads: "To Commander Hui Chang Guang Rui: Now, because of the crisis and peril of the nation, I am a soldier and should have a heavy responsibility. This time, being oppressed by Japan, I really cannot bear it and am deeply saddened. No matter what, I will fight them to the death, and even if I die, it will be an honor. I hope that you will not be saddened by this, and I hope that the condolences will be given in full to my wife, Ms. Martha Liebs (note: Ms. Martha Liebs is a German woman whom Ding married while studying in Germany) and my children, and order them to return to Germany to raise them into talents. I entrust all matters to you two brothers to take care of when the time comes. With deepest gratitude, your revolutionary-minded brother, Ding Jixu, October 10, the 21st year." After Ding led the aircraft to depart on the morning of the 10th, Zhang and Huang opened and read the letter and could not help but burst into tears. They immediately replied to Nanjing, forwarding it to Ding, the telegram read: "To Ding Jixu, Commander of the Ding Squadron of the Nanjing Aviation Department, On the morning of this day, after your departure, we opened and read your letter, knowing that you have the determination to sacrifice for the country, which is generous and tragic, and your spirit overwhelms the barbarians. We admire you immensely. We hope that you will work hard to kill the enemy, to win glory for the nation, and to win honor for our army. Seize the first opportunity, victory can be achieved. We await your triumphant return and will then drink to our hearts' content. Your family affairs will be taken care of properly. Please do not worry. Your brothers, Hui Chang and Guang Rui, salute." After all the aircraft took off at 9:00 am on the 10th, the Second Squadron of aircraft led by Ding arrived at Shaoguan at 11:00 am, refueled, and then took off again to head north. It is expected that they will arrive in Nanjing in the evening. The aircraft led by Ding this time are mostly fighter planes. Those who went with Ding included Deputy Squadron Leader Zeng Zhetang, Platoon Leader Tao Qiande, Wu Ruxin, and more than ten others. (February 11)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Wang Jingwei Holds an External Affairs Committee in Xuzhou <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, Feng Yuxiang, Minister of Interior, Li Jishen, Director-General of Training and Supervision, Zhu Peide, Chief of Staff, and others arrived in Xuzhou on the 12th. After meeting with Central Committee member Chiang Kai-shek, they are now planning to resolve national affairs by advancing both diplomatically and militarily. Therefore, after arriving in Xuzhou, they telegraphed the Foreign Affairs Committee in Beijing, requesting them to send personnel to Xuzhou to participate in the meeting, and also telegraphed to various dignitaries, preparing to attend the military conference. Here is a record of the recent situation, divided into the following sections:</p>
<p>Student Association Petitions About thirty people, including Han Rupun and Meng Guangrun of the Xuzhou Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, went in a group to the North Station at 9:00 am on the 14th to petition President Wang. Their main points were: (1) Request the government to sever diplomatic relations with Japan; (2) Implement assistance to the 19th Route Army; (3) Request the government to safeguard the patriotic movement and investigate and deal with Zhang Xiangchen, who obstructed the patriotic movement, and to unseal the sealed houses to protect the students' patriotic movement. Wang's secretary, Zeng Zhongming, invited the students to board the train, and Wang personally replied.</p>
<p>President Wang's Speech The issue of severing diplomatic relations is of great importance. If I sever diplomatic relations, all countries will remain neutral, and I will not court disaster. Now, Japan's policy towards China is more insidious than severing diplomatic relations. They are dealing with us with vicious means, and we are dealing with them with vicious means. Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Government was forced by the violent Japanese demands to superficially agree to cancel anti-Japanese actions. The National Government and various groups certainly do not think so, so they still insist on this case and fight to the end. As for assisting the 19th Route Army, since the Shanghai War broke out on the 28th of last month, troops were dispatched to assist on the 29th. They are currently transferring troops and generals. The dispatch of troops by Yu Jishi, Zhang Fakui, Chen Jitang, and others can be clear evidence. Soldiers do not dislike deception, and military affairs must be kept secret. It is not convenient to announce the number of troops dispatched by the government and the arrival of the destination. Recently, a strong force has been transferred. Of course, the government will safeguard the patriotic movement, but it must follow the rules and maintain order to avoid disputes. Otherwise, it will be called patriotism, but there will be many failures. Zhang Xiangchen's obstruction of the patriotic movement, local affairs can be resolved by local people. I can only offer advice and wait for a reply after investigation. However, to boycott enemy goods, the best way is to strictly prohibit sellers. Now, when the country is in trouble, I hope that the whole country will eliminate prejudices, unite in spirit, face the national crisis together, make a permanent resistance, be unyielding and unbending, and seek the consolidation of national defense.</p>
<p>External Affairs Committee Meeting President Wang telegraphed the Beijing Foreign Affairs Committee to send personnel to Xuzhou to participate in the meeting after arriving in Xuzhou. According to Mr. Zeng Zhongming, members of the Foreign Affairs Committee will come to Xuzhou soon, and the meeting should be held today or tomorrow. Although the military committee has telegraphed various generals to prepare for a meeting, the location of the meeting, whether in Xuzhou or Luoyang, and the time are still difficult to determine, as Mr. Jiang, Zhu, Feng, and Li are responsible for convening it. It is heard that Han Fuqu has sent Representative Jiang Baicheng, who should arrive in Xuzhou tonight. Liu Zhi, Ma Hongkui, and Liu Zhenhua had previously met in Henan. It is said that Chiang may not come to Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Commemorative Week Speech In the last paragraph of Mr. Wang Jingwei's speech at the expanded commemorative week of the Xuzhou Jinpu Garrison Headquarters on the 15th of this month, he said: "Some people say that we should sever diplomatic relations and declare war on Japan. We must first ask, has Japan severed diplomatic relations with China? Has Japan declared war on China? But in fact, it has already exceeded severing diplomatic relations and declaring war. Such high-sounding words cannot remedy the current situation. Even if we sever diplomatic relations with Japan, will they not be able to attack Shanghai? It must be known that in this Sino-Japanese issue, China has sufficient reasons to demand international intervention in Japan, because Japan has violated the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Now that we have sufficient reasons in diplomacy, why should we abandon diplomatic methods? Why drive all countries to remain neutral? We have a country, so we have the right to negotiate. We have not yet perished, so why can't we negotiate? Only Korea cannot negotiate, because its country has already perished. It must be known that negotiation is possible, only signing treaties that cede rights and humiliate the country is not possible. In the past, when Mr. Jiang was the chairman of the National Government, he always refused to sign treaties that ceded rights and humiliated the country. After Mr. Jiang resigned, the current National Government also refuses to sign treaties that cede rights and humiliate the country. If Japan abandons its unreasonable demands, then we can negotiate at any time. Therefore, resist on one hand and negotiate on the other, both at the same time. Resist militarily and negotiate diplomatically, without losing territory and without losing sovereignty. We will not retreat below the minimum limit, and we will not shout high-sounding words above the minimum limit. This is our way to face the national crisis together. Finally, I have a few words to say. My brothers' visit to Xuzhou this time is only a transit, so they have not been able to contact various local civil organizations one by one. Local affairs are handled by the local authorities, and there is no need for my brothers to handle them directly. Therefore, regarding the issue of economic severance raised by the student representatives yesterday, my brothers can only offer some opinions on principles. My brothers believe that before economic severance is resolved, it is natural for merchants to buy and sell Japanese goods, but after economic severance is resolved, it is still the behavior of good merchants to buy and sell Japanese goods, then they should be severely punished. Therefore, the question of before and after should be clearly distinguished in order to be reasonable. There is also one point, now that the people of the whole country are uniting to resist Japan, everyone must work together in order to be effective. For example, in the party, although there have been various disputes in the past, but in the face of this national crisis, everyone has united sincerely to face the national crisis together. Look at the political parties in various European countries, when they encounter war, everyone immediately puts down all disputes to face the national crisis together. People outside the party are like this, let alone people within the same party. Furthermore, armed comrades and civil organizations should cooperate in the same way. Civil organizations, farmers, industrialists, and businessmen should also cooperate in the same way. Only in this way can we face the national crisis together. In short, we should not be optimistic or pessimistic about the current national crisis. We will resist on one hand and negotiate on the other, without shouting high-sounding words in the opposition and without saying soft words in the government, and fight Japan for a long time with a calm spirit. What is especially important is that everyone works together. Today, my brothers are very fortunate to meet you here and take this opportunity to pay my respects to you."</p>

<p>Due to a Conflict Between Citizens and Japanese Residents Zhenjiang Correspondence: Yesterday, the Japanese destroyer Mochizuki stationed in Zhenjiang sent three Japanese people, including Taguchi Takeo, ashore to shop and detour through the streets and alleys, with the intention of scouting the defenses. This was spotted by the masses, who followed them. A conflict occurred in the Yangfu Bridge area. The police on duty immediately mediated and sent personnel from the Provincial Public Security Bureau to escort them back to the warship, expressing their apologies and stating that if the warship needed to shop in the future, it could entrust the Public Security Bureau to handle it on its behalf to avoid misunderstandings. The warship did not agree and made very harsh demands, requesting the provincial government to guarantee their safety. Negotiations are still underway. Li Mingyang, the commander of the Provincial Martial Law Command, announced a special martial law tonight (the 15th).</p>
