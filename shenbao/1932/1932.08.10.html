<h3 id="c1">論銀借欵　（上）仁 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自十七世紀初葉至一八七一年。金銀價格。常固定於一比十五之間。逮乎一八七二年德國採用金本位後世界各國咸相率廢銀用金。於是銀價日趨崩落。一九零四年。我國以減輕庚子賠欵之負擔。一時亦有廢銀採金之計劃。因之銀價更趨下跌。一九零九年之銀價平均爲每盎斯二十三辨士又十六。</p>
<p>分之十一。較之一八七一年之每盎斯六十辨土。相差旣及五分之三。其後至一九二零年一月。以印度需銀浩大。由美政府國庫供給以二萬萬盎斯。另一方面。美政府又自民間以每盎斯一金元之價格。收買同量之銀。一時倫敦銀價。遂重復於六十一辨士左右。然不久英政府又以預算之不足。減低銀貨純分以補償又一九二六年。印度廢金匯兌本位而採金地金本位。於是世界銀。</p>
<p>市塲上。抛量驟增。一九二九年銀價遂重落至於每盎斯二十三辨士。一九三零年二月。更發見十九辨士六分之五的新低價。而同月我國之標金市塲。遂突破五百兩大關而上之。一年以來。每况愈下。昨年一月。銀價已降至十三辨士左右。而標金。已突破七百兩大關矣。</p>
<p>當此銀價狂落之時。美上議員畢德門氏。領袖調查中美貿易副委員會。二月二十一日發表一調查報告書。提出一議案於上院。請胡佛總統召集一研究整頓銀價問題之世界大會。而美上院委員會報告。建議與我政府談判十萬萬盎斯生銀借欵事。當是時。國府顧問林百克氏。更竭力從中斡旋。以冀其成。但其後以各方意見之紛歧。議未果行。</p>
<p>夫銀價之崩落。在銀本位之我國。究屬爲利爲害。自不能以一言斷之。在貨幣理論上而言。銀價暴落之結果。金銀兩不同本位國間之貿易。必發生一極大之阻礙。換言之。銀價下跌時。用銀國之輸出必增。輸入必減。然値此世界不景氣之。秋事實往往與理論不符。蓋世界不景氣之結果。各國購買力已消失殆盡。雖金銀比價懸殊。而用銀國之輸出。事實上仍無所增。反之。在世界不景氣漩淌之中。各國物價咸趨下落。今銀價趨跌。用銀國雖可藉金貴銀賤之機會稍制其輸入。然事實上金貴銀賤之作用。已爲物價低落所相殺。輸入仍無。</p>
<p>所減。其次在金貴銀賤風潮澎湃之時。理論上於原料國之用銀國家爲無益。於工業國之用銀國家爲有利。以我國之現狀而論。當屬害多利少。但因上述輸入關係之失常。似又不能顯見其弊也。</p>

<p>陳述訂立非戰約經過　　路透八日紐約電國務卿史汀生今日對外交會演說、謂余以爲白里安與凱格格之非戰公約、將成我國永遠大政策之一云、史氏詳述此約之由來、並謂批評者指此不爲條約、但爲一束簽字國之片面聲明耳、實則如此批評、未免錯誤、因此約確載有切實諾言也、史氏繼言及東三省之中日衝突、謂美國向中日聲明、美國不承認違反國聯會章與巴黎公約義務而造成之任何時局、此種見解、後爲國聯所通過、贊成之者五十國美、美政府此舉、訴諸共同新情操、全體文明國家對此旣有一致之主張、則此舉已發生新意味、道德上之反對、成爲全世界之反對時、則即發生國際公法前所未有之新意味云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社八日紐約電國務卿史汀生今日對久交委員會演說、其主要旨趣、爲（白里安凱洛格非戰條約所表示之舉世希望和平心理、應以輿論之制裁爲後盾、其簽字各國如見該約有受侵犯之威脅時、有互相協助之必要、）史汀生將該約簽訂時、以至一九三二年中日滿洲事件發生時止、三年間和平情形叙述一過、史氏演說之主要點大致如下、（輿論爲所有國際關係之制裁、其平時有效與否、全視各民族是否確欲使之生效以爲斷、如各民族欲其生效、則輿論之力勢不可當、凡國家之呼籲於輿論者如欲收效、必於呼籲之後、繼以各國家之互相討論、互相諮詢而後可、）歐戰以來、組織國際和平之事實、層出不窮、轉瞬均已過去、史氏又將其種種經過略予叙述、並謂自有國際法之始、以至歐戰時爲止、國際關係之基礎上、不能脫離戰爭之可能性、白里安凱洛格條約之訂立、實爲人類思想之革命、此項條約、並非僅爲表示誠意之宣言、乃爲一種有拘束力之條約、除正當防衛以外、不准從事戰爭、條約拘束應有之意義、彼盡有之矣、史氏最後又謂美國極信該條約之價値、故願誠意維持之、</p>
<p>國民社九日日内瓦電昨日美國務卿史汀生在紐約向外交委員會之演說、已使國聯中人發生深刻印象、以爲史氏之述及非戰公約、意在請將該公約引用於中日爭執、照目前形勢、國聯大會今後對付遠東事變、頗有採用所謂（史汀生主義）之可能、按史汀生主義即不承認武力變更領土是、</p>
<p>路透九日倫敦電泰晤士報社論略謂美國務卿史汀生解釋美國對於非戰公約之態度、並言及東三省之爭執、其言可視爲美國官塲宣布其外交政策之甚重要議論、美京認此與李頓調查團提出報告書時發生之時局、有特殊關係、史氏所吐露之政策、在國際關係之全部前途上、頗有價値、且亦重要云、孟却斯特指導報亦著社論、謂非戰公約之效率、已受試騐、不過簽約國雖有抗議、日本終據有東三省全境耳、美國與國聯會員國皆爲不承認東三省時局之政策所拘束、但此未必能切實干涉日本積極政策之進行、雖然、世界輿論固已一變矣云</p>
<p>路透九日紐約電紐約時報評論國務卿史汀生之言論、謂此言論至關重要、不僅因其宣布美國遵守與他國協商之原則、且因此言之發表、適在國聯大會行將集議、再行處理與遠東和平有關的複雜問題之時也云、</p>
<p>電通社九日東京電美國務卿史汀生於昨日之外交委員會談非戰條約之效力時、會呼日本係侵略者、今晨外務省接電後、外務當局甚覺憤慨、謂日本因美國現在選舉大總統、故外交交涉不爲過甚、而史汀生國務卿乃議論中日問題、在負責任者之國務卿、不能不謂爲出言不愼、故决定將提出重要抗議、以促史氏之反省、</p>

<p>在九月中旬、</p>
<p>山東省（一）臨淸最近有多量雨水、發育良好、棉樹高達一尺、已滿開花、照現在狀况、有八九分收成、濟南新花上市約在九月中旬、（二）高唐連日降雨、雨水充分、倘今後天氣順調、可有八九分收成、棉樹高達一尺、開花已過半數、新花上市在九月中旬、（三）夏津與高唐情形相同、極爲良好、可有八九分收成、九月上旬新花或可上市、（四）淸平棉作良好、高約一尺、已全開花、濟南新花上市約在九月中旬、（五）恩縣與其他各處不同、近無雨水堪憂、如今後二三禮拜内得有甘霖、或能得八分收成、新花上市約在九月中旬、</p>
<p>平漢線（一）廣平棉作漸好、棉樹高七八寸、已値開花期、大概得有九分收成、濟南新棉上市約在</p>
<p>九月下旬、（二）彰德天氣繼續順調、棉樹高約八九寸、已値開花時期、有八九分收成、濟南新棉上市約在九月下旬以後、因最近連日降雨、棉作一時頗有憂慮、然大都爲陣雨、其間仍得受充分之日光、經過反爲良好、一般人言有八九分收成、估計收獲量及濟南上市量、第一次與現在並無變化、濟南自九月初旬起、必有相當數量上市云、</p>

<p>划子顚覆十餘人落浦</p>
<p>一女工得救撈獲二尸</p>
<p>日郵社歐洲班輪箱根丸、前日由港來滬、停泊於匯山碼頭、昨晨五時許、離滬赴日、出口調頭時、機葉擊沉舢舨、致誤人命、茲將出事情形、探錄於後、</p>
<p>出事經過箱根丸此次由歐洲來滬、當靠虹口匯山碼頭、裝卸貨物、乃於昨晨五時四十五分起椗赴日、當用拖駁拖帶、並須調頭、斯時適値漲潮、水流甚急、照例漲潮調頭、須先將船尾拖向浦東、然後船頭向外開駛、拖駁將船尾向浦東拖去、其時適有一划子、自其昌棧滿載女工至浦西工作、行經箱根丸船尾、因見該輪停車、急擬趨過、不料該機葉怱然發動、浪花四濺、將一小划子立時擊沉、致在船十餘人、完全沉没浦底、</p>
<p>一女得救划子被擊沉之時、雖呼救之聲不絕、但因該輪船大、機件發動力甚鉅、浪高數尺、在旁之船、均不敢趨前拖救、祗得坐觀其沉没、待該輪遠離後、已無從打撈、祗有一女得救、名瞿富英、年約十二歲、當划子顚覆、其落水時、被浪打入其昌碼頭下、該女卽抱住碼頭水泥柱脚、乃由一老者見而抱至上岸、該女自行奔回家中、後據威妥瑪路水巡捕房查得、悉該女回家後、因當時受驚、並飲水數口、致成疾病、惟尚無大危險云、</p>
<p>捕房調查威妥瑪路水巡捕房得報後、遂派探捕馳赴出事地點調查、見箱根丸照常出口、當將出事之划子、及船夫江北人杜居田·杜小丁子帶回捕房、並在其昌碼頭有一吳兆韓之妻吳楊氏啼哭、遂亦帶回捕房、據吳楊氏云、與女吳品弟、年十三歲、及姪女楊金翠年十六歲、同在申新七廠作工、故一同乘划子赴浦西做工、氏因欲赴上海、故另乘市輪渡小輪、在小火輪上、見二女所乘之划子忽然打沉、知我二女已溺斃、並云氏共生九孩、八孩已夭亡、祗留此一女、以謀將來招婿靠老、言時聲涙俱下、十分悽慘、當由捕頭慰勸一番、送之返家、俟撈獲後、再行通知認領、</p>
<p>溺斃人數捕房當將舟子杜居田·杜小丁子帶回捕房後、當由捕頭預審、據供共儎十人、並將出事情形申述、遂將划子船夫一併暫押水巡捕房、俟明晨（卽今晨）解送地方法院發落、據出險之瞿富英云、當時同船約有十二人、捕房因除吳品弟之母報告外、並無别人家族報告、諒家族或有不知者、又因尸體尚未撈獲、故人數尚缺根據、</p>
<p>打撈情形當出事後、除水巡捕設法打撈外、另有其昌棧買辦廣東人某君、僱小網船打撈、願出每具洋三元、至十時許、由朱大王子網船、在附近浦江中撈得一具女尸、年約十歲、適有家族在旁、當卽領去收殮、未經捕房、後於十一時半又在碼頭旁撈起一具女尸、年約十五歲、名倪林弟、適巡捕瞥見、乃命網船將尸體送往水巡捕房、由捕房用小輪送往南市救生局暫厝、俟明晨（卽今晨）報法院相騐、</p>
<p>日輪報告箱根丸出事後、認爲與本輪無涉、又因班期關係、不加施救、照常出口一方主船發無綫電、報告本埠日郵社云、</p>

<p>一刀兩斷成讖語兇手浦鶴年、年二十三歲、靑浦人、男性、被害人王秀英、年二十五歲、蘇州人、女性、在上月十九日、同往租賃張小泉剪力舖後樓一間居住、言明房租每月六完、浦自稱姓陳、係夫妻、渠爲小學敎員、二房東見其行動尚屬斯文、故亦未詳究來歷、况平日間二人頗屬親密、亦不疑有他、前晚（八日）秀英外出未歸、直至昨晨始返、及鶴年昨午進膳返家、即訊其昨晚宿在何處、秀英答以在開房間、因此雙方即起爭執、最後秀英說、旣彼此不合、不妨一刀兩斷、並令鶴年出立離異筆據、時浦怒不可遏、即聲言汝旣欲一刀兩斷、亦有辦法、乃即取桌上之菜刀、猛向秀英面部砍去、</p>
<p>二房東機警嗚捕時秀英僅穿短背心及短褲、臥在床上、當被在面部砍中一刀、亟從床中躍起、狂呼救命時樓下二房東劉曹氏、正在午餐、聞得救命聲後、即停箸上樓、急扣房門、呼浦不應、乃蹲身就門隙中窺探、則見秀英在地亂滾、呼痛不止、地板上滿污血漢、　會氏知有變故、乃亟反身下樓、囑徒鳴捕、重行反身上樓、則秀英已氣絕、而浦鶴年已下梯及半、正思脫逃、當爲劉曹氏扭住、適附近站岡之第二零二三號巡捕亦得報趕到、遂將兇手拘送匯山捕房、一面由捕房派員至出事地點查勘一過、即將死屍車送斐倫路騐屍所待騐、</p>
<p>姘夫不准再姘人據兇手浦鶴</p>
<p>年在捕房供稱、係專在各處兜售人丹爲生、被害人王秀英係其姘婦、在本年三月二十五日、乘蘇州班輪船時相識、先住法租界、後因浦之髮妻來滬、乃始遷斯處、近來秀英不守本分、時常外宿、前晚又復不歸、並探悉伊近與中央旅社某茶房發生關係、前晚外宿、即秀英與某茶房在蘇州旅社好宿之故、本人稍加質問、秀英即逼立離據、因此憤而出此云、</p>
<p>共砍七刀斷左手王秀英被浦鶴年共砍七刀、五刀在頭部、計喉間二刀、眼鼻面等部三刀、右肩背一刀、左手已被砍斷落下、故當時血流滿地、樓下及房間内床帳等處、均滿濺血漬、死屍躺在血泊中、厥狀至爲悽慘、令人不忍卒睹、</p>

<h3 id="c237">六脈渠 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>廣州市暴雨成災，打破數十年的紀錄！根據粤報紀載：市民淹斃無算，屋宇倒塌無算；可憐惠老院，化做水晶宮！寡苦伶仃的老頭兒，老婆子，都做了落湯雞！統計男女</p>
<p>兩院，溺斃者已達三百餘人，其他罹災的市民，尚不在此數。値得哼兩句古文：｜傷心慘目，有如是耶？</p>
<p>調查暴雨成災的起因，弊在溝渠的宣洩不暢。廣州市所恃宣洩雨水的溝渠呌做六脈渠顧名思義，六脈兩個字題的很好：人的六脈不調，人便要害病；水的六脈不暢，水便要橫决。向來市政當局，每把疏通六脈渠當做重要工作；現在呢，管理工務的官吏，竟把六脈總渠改窄而使緊束其口；溝口一窄，那麽，過多的雨量，不及宣洩，便發生這空前慘劇了！所以暴雨成災的暴字，簡直寃枉了雨師；雨何嘗暴，暴的是改窄溝口的官吏。　我想，有形的六脈渠，固然要隨時宣洩；無形的六脈渠，也不能緊束其口。一切民意機關輿論機關，越是暢達，越見得政治淸明；要是，也抱着改窄主義，緊束子他們的口；那麽，防民之口，甚於防川，無形的暴雨成災，比着有形的暴雨成災，益發不可以收拾。</p>
<p>廣州市六脈渠的横决，便是政府諸公接受的一種好敎訓</p>

<p>王翼吾君述閻典史死守江陰事。（王君誤閻爲嚴）意在嘉獎東北義勇軍之忠勇愛國。而痛恨一班身居高位者之不愛國。無氣節。然猶冀其感激義軍。或能翻然覺悟。用武力收回失地。立言未嘗不善。惜於閻典史旣誤其姓。又未及其名。并其籍貫。以及初到江陰時。保衛地方事。均未之詳。爰爲補其闕漏。以吉閲報諸君。俾慨慕英豪者有所稽考耳。按邵靑門閻典史傳。閻典史。名應元。字麗亨。其先浙紹興人。後家直隸之通州。應元起掾吏。官京倉大使。崇禎十四年。遷江陰典史。始至。有江盜百艘。張幟乘潮。闌入内地。將薄城。會縣令攝篆旁邑。丞簿選　。男女奔竄。應元帶刀鞬出。躍馬大呼於市曰。好男子。從我殺賊。護家室。一時從者千人。然苦無幟。應元又馳至竹行。呼曰。事急矣。人假一竿。直取諸我。千人者。布立江岸。矛若林立。士若堵牆。應元往來馳射。發一矢。輙斃一賊。賊連斃者三。氣懾揭帆去。（按今世宼盜充斥。官斯土者。類皆於羣盜飽掠遠颺後。始派軍警出追。對於閻典史。能勿愧死。）其後應元遷廣東某縣主簿。以母病未行。會國變。挈家僑居邑東之砂山。（上下皆略節）豫王大軍渡江。分遣貝勒及他將。路定東南郡縣。自京口以下。一月間。下名城大縣以百數。江陰以彈丸下邑。死守八十餘日而後下。蓋應元之謀居多。初。薙髮令下。諸生許用德。率衆哭明倫堂。士民聚者萬人。欲奉縣尉陳明選主城守。明選曰。吾智勇不若閻君。此大事。須閻君來。乃夜馳騎往迎應元。應元投袂起。率家丁夜馳入城。料檢備具。乃分城而守。武舉黃略守東門。把總某守南門。陳明選守西門。應元自守北門。部署旣定。而城圍合。凡死守八十一日。大軍圍城者二十五萬。死六萬七千。巷戰死者又七千。城中死者無慮五六萬。尸骸枕藉。街巷皆滿。然竟無一人降者。中間曾乘黑夜遣壯士縋城入營。順風縱火。軍亂。自蹂踐死者甚衆。軍郤。離城三里止營。帥劉良佐。擁騎至城下。呼曰。吾與閻君雅故。欲相見。應元立城上與語。劉故弘光四鎭之一。封廣昌伯。已降。官總者也。遙語應元。弘光已走。江南無主。君早降。可保富貴。應元曰。某明朝一典史耳。尚知大義。將軍祚土分茅。爲國重鎭。不能保障江淮。乃爲敵前驅。何面目見吾邑義士乎。良佐慚退。應元偉軀幹。面蒼黑。微鬚。性嚴毅。號令　肅。犯法者不稍　。顧　　。賞賜無所吝。與壯士語。必稱好兄弟。不呼名。陳明選每巡城。拊循士卒。相勞苦。或至流涕。故兩人皆能得士心。士樂爲之死。按靑門閻典史傅。近二千字。茲摘錄大要。以見守城之梗概。至捐集鉅欵。則國子上舍程璧。首捐二萬五千金以爲之倡。捐者麕集。皆感激閻君之義。閻君其時已遷官他省。退職典史。猶負守土之職如是。</p>

<p>讀自由談石子君（西瓜漫談）述瓜皮可醃而佐饌。未嘗詳其藥物功用。是非瓜之知已也。以余所知。略舉數事。聊貢一得之愚云爾。</p>
<p>西瓜一名寒瓜。以産於西域得名。歐陽修五代史四夷附錄。載胡　居契丹。始食西瓜。云契丹破回紇。始得此種。故今日新疆哈密等地。産瓜甚富。明李時珍著本草綱目。謂晉陶弘景注瓜蒂。言永嘉　晉懷帝！有寒瓜甚大。可藏至春。蓋其時瓜種已入浙東。但無西瓜之名耳。夫動植物之非産於中土者甚夥。唐元微之詩云。（何年安石國。萬里貢榴花。）蓋石榴一名若榴。又名安石榴。漢張鶱出使西域。得塗林安石國榴種以歸。此爲中土有石榴之始。西瓜亦猶是耳。李時珍讀書不治經生業。獨好醫書。明史方伎傳極稱之。西瓜之可入藥。蓋自李時珍始。</p>
<p>傷寒又名腸窒扶斯。爲秋夏極危險之疾病。其病原則在飲污水。多食瓜果。貪凉露宿。而病菌遂猖獗矣。此病在病發後二三周間。熱度最高。醫治偶一不愼。往往大命乃傾。中醫治此病較易奏效。藥劑中有用羚羊角、石膏等冷藥者。不知西瓜爲唯一之特效藥也。（西醫遇病人高熱時、往往用冰袋療法、最爲危險、不如飲瓜汁爲妥、又吾人當睡熟時、千萬不可開電扇於旁、以予所知、死於此者甚多、愼之、愼之、）是以西瓜在秋冬之時。家中亦宜預藏一二枚。以備不時之需。豈徒供消暑而已哉。先王母早歲病傷寒、幾殆、後以西瓜治愈、）</p>
<p>臌脹一症。多起於腎臟之失其排洩作用。西瓜性能利尿。故爲腎臓病之特殊藥。法以蒜頭塞瓜瓤中。瓜外塗以泥。文火炙之。迨泥乾後。取瓜汁飲之。可治臌脹之疾。或云以雄雞糞塞瓜中。服其汁。似不如蒜頭之淸潔也。</p>
<p>以瓜皮切爲粉　。和石灰、麻油。製成液質。爲火燙之妙藥。搽後立覺痛止。且有防腐之功。諺有之。（西瓜又名白虎湯。伏天喫之病無妨。）此言良然。然吾聞眞西山曰。瓜桃生冷宜少餐。免致秋來成瘧痢。）黃履素曰。（人皆指西瓜能辟暑。生冷中不忌之。殊不知暑中奔走後。覺胸中熱氣塡塞。若浸冷食之。雖可辟暑。究有大害。若晏坐高堂。日以爲常供。則有損脾胃。）又若房後、睡醒食瓜。皆極危險。愼毋謂西瓜之可飽飫無害也。諸君鑒。七月份辱承投稿。略備酬資。自即日起。除星期日及每月二十六至次月六日止爲結賬時期停止付費外請於每日下午兩點至四點鐘。向本館會計處領取爲盼。若數月併領。須按月分條别具蓋章。嗣後如蒙惠稿。無論篇幅長短。均須於稿上蓋章。以便領取酬資時核對。否則作却酬論。再會計處爲劃淸手續便利結賬起見。酬資以發表日起六個月滿期。届時仍有未來領者。認爲不願受酬。即行將賬取銷。並希亮察。自由談編輯部啟</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>吳秀才自通電下野，閉户讀書以來，久未聞吳秀才的高論，今讀其致蔣介石書，請速定國是，明布憲章，重整倫理綱常等等，其言深爲懇切著明，非常欽佩，但是他說來有認爲滿意的，也有認爲不滿意的，</p>
<p>他說（禮敎本爲社會之母，道德尤無東西新舊之分，）云云，他所認爲禮敎道德，猶是三綱五常，八德九經，這也是未免腦筋太舊了，其實現在中國的壞處，就是舊禮敎破壞以後，没有新的禮敎來建設，舊的道德破壞以後，没有新的道德來承襲，因爲有舊禮敎的好處，也有舊禮敎的壞處，有舊道德的好處，也有舊道德的壞處，總之一國自有一國的禮敎道德，如舊禮敎舊道德旣無，而新的禮敎道德也一些没有，這是如何成爲國家呢？</p>
<p>古者聖王治定功成，製禮作樂，以表示一代的憲章文物，是故三王不同禮，五帝不同樂，禮敎之爲物，本來因時代而變遷的，故從前的禮敎，不適用於現代的潮流，這是無論何人，莫能否認的，至於道德，從前我國講的，是俠義的道德，現在各國講的，是廣義的道德，故各國所講的道德，不外二端，一道德至高的標的何在，一如何爲我人最後的正鵠，試一研究西洋倫理學史，知外</p>
<p>人未嘗無道德也，</p>
<p>現在我國舊禮敎舊道德早已打倒，試問新的禮敎在那裏？新的道德在那裏？從前丈夫對於其妻，有七出之條，實爲人道的蟊賊，現在到有八出九出了，并無條文可以限制了，從前子女不好，父母可以告忤逆，現在子女對父母要告忤逆了，蘇俄共産黨，不過要打倒資本主義，現在我國任何人要打倒了，眞所謂上無道揆，下無法守，綱維墮地，號令不行，這不能怪新禮敎的不好，是無禮敎的不好，不能怪新道德的不好，是無道德的不好。</p>
<p>吳秀才閉户讀書，專門研究我國的聖經賢傳，頗有心得，不過對於時代的病根，恐尚没有觀察的切當麽？</p>

<p>— 卓陶</p>
<p>除了瓶詰罐頭，我們可以由玻璃的外面觀察罐頭内的内容物的好壞外，普通罐頭我們是没法去審察牠内容物的好壞·我們去買罐頭要拼機會，拼到好的就是好的，拼到壞的就算觸霉頭；拼到壞的罐頭不但經濟有損，而且對於衛生也是很有妨害的·因爲壞罐頭的内容物的變化是很多的，而且是含毒質的·間有人不愼食了壞罐頭，得了種種不易治的疾病·所以我們買罐頭不可不愼·今將檢查罐頭的最普通的方法述之如左：</p>
<p>一、外觀的　普通罐頭的好壞，旣不能由外面觀察，又不能當面打開來看·我們祇有觀察罐頭的外形而推定牠的内容物的好壞；就是觀察罐頭蓋底等澎脹與否是也。倘罐頭在製造時脫氣脫得完全，加熱加得足·罐頭内的空氣就稀薄，蓋底當呈凹陷之現，此即爲良好的罐頭。若容器製造或脫氣加熱不完全時，罐頭的蓋底每多凸出，此即爲内外空</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>氣相通或内容物已腐敗而發生氣體之證。外觀檢查法除含氣式罐詰及瓶詰外，一般罐頭多適用之。</p>
<p>二、擊打的　經過外觀檢查之後，尚不能决定爲好壞，還須再經一擊打的檢查後，方能决定爲好壞。擊打檢查者，以金屬製的或堅木製的（即秤桿亦可）棒輕輕擊打罐頭的蓋底，以其發音之淸濁辨别内容物的好壞。其聲音以内容物的種類及調理法與液汁的多寡，容器的形狀自有不同，要之有堅實的淸音者爲好的，虚浮而濁混者不好的居多數，</p>

<h3 id="c247">改良祭祀問題之我見 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 提議者黃影呆</p>
<p>祖先是不拘什麽人都有的，我們爲了要追記祖先，所以時常要祭祖。但近人的祭祖問題，我覺得耗費太大了，就一年之中，祭祖的次數，生日死忌，姑且勿計，普通的人家，大槪免不了的，至少要祭六次，就是淸明，夏至，七月半，十月期，冬至，年夜等，　每次祭祖的時候，有錢的人家固不必說，用掉幾十幾百元的也有，就是中等以下的人家，燒些菜，點些香燭，還要燒錫箔，至少也要化兩三塊錢，這樣一年六次，所費的錢也是有二十元左右了，而且祖先生日死忌的日子，還要小祭。</p>
<p>鬼的有無，直到現在，我們還没有得到充分的證明，那麽祭祖的時候，又何必要燒許多菜，菜放在桌子上，祭好了依然這幾樣菜，一些也没有吃掉，至於點香燭燒錫箔長錠等，更是無謂極了，白是化掉許多的錢。</p>
<p>照這樣看來，那麽我們祭祖可不必祭了嗎？這當然是不可以的，如果不祭了祖先，那麽所有的祖先，兒孫都要忘記一個乾凈了，所以這裏我以爲祭祖本不可不祭，不過祭的時候，要換一種方式，以免一切無謂的消耗，現在一般的人，祭祖的時候，祗知形式方面，菜有幾碗，錫箔化多少，而不知尊敬從事，原是大謬而不然呢。</p>
<p>現在照我個人的意見，想幾種改良祭祀的方法在下面，和讀者討論一下。</p>
<p>（一）一年之中，祭祖的次數，改六次爲二次，實行春秋二祭，因爲六次是太多而太麻煩了。</p>
<p>（一）不點香燭，因爲點香燭是没有什麽意思的。</p>
<p>（一）不燒錫箔，如果說錫箔而爲鬼的錢鈔，眞是滑天下人之大稽，那裏會有用，所以我主張在祭祖時不燒錫箔，免去無謂的消費。</p>
<p>（一）不用菜，改用鮮花鮮果，這樣所費旣少，而又覺得來得尊敬莊嚴。</p>
<p>（一）主祭的人，在祭祖的時候，要十分的莊嚴尊敬，並須率領家人，爲之演講歷代祖先的歷史並偉績，使一般的兒孫，對於祖先，在腦筋之中，能永遠的遺留着深刻的印象。</p>
<p>上面所提出的改良祭祀問題，不知本會會員以爲如何，望大家來討論一下。</p>
<h3 id="c248">吾之對於改良吃飯問題 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 其行</p>
<p>爲避免病菌的傳染，共食主義果有改良的必要，若說改成一湯一菜的分食制，那麽對於吾們歷來的胃口不免有所不合，但是若照果盤式的分食，那麽一格一格的分配，已很感不便，並且要使碗盆都改成果盤式，那麽非通知全國　匠不可，這倒不是一件容易的事呢？對於經濟落後的人家，更没有資格談及了｜</p>
<p>現在吾的愚見以爲共食分食的折衷辦法，可使手續和經濟方面，一些不受損失且可收到滿美的結果，就是每飯的時候，各人多備一二盆和一二匙，把本來所共食的菜，自已用匙另外盛出放在各人自備的盆内，配口的菜可多盛些，而後以另一匙作食，那盛剩的菜仍放在桌中，若食完後可再盛，那麽對於一切的傳染，可以避免，且經濟亦無耗費，每家祇要多備幾只盆和匙就夠了，至於式子，吾們又何必照西式呢？祇要合用，那麽就另成一式也何仿呢？（却酬）</p>

<p>— 仁</p>
<p>半夜，睡在床上，作了個夢，夢着一羣臭虫從墻壁裏爬出，在我的肉山上游行示威，臭虫甲站在我的鼻尖上對大衆演講，似乎說道：</p>
<p>（諸君，趕快起來，昨夜，我因爲向人類吃了一口血，到了白書，他竟用（飛力脫）來澆，用洋燭來燒，結果，我們的同伴竟死了五六十名之多，豈有此理，人類原來是這樣殘忍的嗎，非報仇不可，我們是吮血黨，是上帝造出來的，我們若要生存，必須努力奮鬥，聯絡蚊虫蚤蝨蒼蠅各族，去和人類抵抗。</p>
<p>我們是萬物的弱者，除了吮飽一口血外，便無别種嗜好了，人類却不然，他們不僅是可怕的吃飯黨，而且除了吃飯外，尚有其他塡不滿的慾望，像我們每夜區區的一點要求，倒不肯接受，反要來肅淸我們，驅除我們，我們受了人類的壓迫，已經有數千年的歷史了。）</p>
<p>我覺得身上有一羣東西在爬行，但我還是做夢。臭虫乙聽了甲的演講，互相呼應的爬到我的左手的臂上，接着甲的話再說下丢。</p>
<p>（照釋迦牟尼的旨意，萬物是應該平等的，所以，最博愛的要算他的弟子｜和尚了。我們常常吮他們的血，他們却從未怨言，而實行殺戮。但，我們不能因和尚們的好欺，而一味吮他們的血；我們應該向虐待我們的敵人，下總攻擊。）</p>
<p>（諸君，趕快起來，爲我們的種族生存，去幹我們的吮血黨革命！）</p>
<p>臭虫乙演講畢，大衆拍手，其中有一頭，最大最長而身上又是最紅色的，舉止蹣跚，爬到我的肩膀上，向異族嘶聲宣傳道：</p>
<p>（蚊虫蚤虱蒼蠅輩呀！你們都一齊起來，把虎利拉，瘟疫，傳染病等帶到人類面前，當武器的向他們宣戰吧！我們因爲是萬物的弱者，便應互相團結起來，爲吮血黨保持地位。）</p>
<p>我身上覺得非常的癢，竟熬不住地被擾醒了。我奇怪我怎麽會做這樣奇怪的夢。在這個當兒，天尚未亮，我開了電燈，擦擦眼睛，偵探似的向四邊看察。不對了！我的全身都是塊，凹凸不平的腫着，彷彿蒸熟了玉蜀黍，赤色的吮血黨，在墻壁上排隊游行。，此外，尚有蚊虫奏着勝利的音樂，放出他們的刺刀，向我衝鋒，蚤虱蒼蠅共同活動着，下總動員令，我没有辦法，只得逃避了那個房間，讓他們去革命。</p>
<p>啓事素芳鑒復書讀悉，所定計畫殊爲妥當，惟尚有斟酌之處，請於今明日下午三四時來館面談一切，否則在報上答復亦可。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On Silver Loans (Part 1) – Ren <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>From the early 17th century to 1871, the price ratio between gold and silver was consistently fixed at 1:15. However, following Germany's adoption of the gold standard in 1872, countries worldwide gradually abandoned silver in favor of gold. Consequently, the price of silver steadily declined. In 1904, China considered abandoning silver for gold to alleviate the burden of the Boxer Indemnity, which further accelerated the fall in silver prices. In 1909, the average silver price was 23 pence and 11/16 per ounce, a difference of three-fifths compared to 60 pence per ounce in 1871. Subsequently, until January 1920, due to significant silver demand from India, the U.S. government supplied 200 million ounces from its treasury. Simultaneously, the U.S. government purchased the same amount of silver from the public at a price of one gold dollar per ounce. As a result, the London silver price temporarily rebounded to around 61 pence. However, the British government soon reduced the silver content of coinage due to budget deficits. In 1926, India abandoned the gold exchange standard and adopted the gold bullion standard, leading to a sharp increase in silver disposal on the world silver market. In 1929, the silver price fell again to 23 pence per ounce. In February 1930, a new low of 19 pence and 5/6 was recorded. In the same month, the benchmark gold price in China surpassed 500 taels. Over the past year, the situation has continued to deteriorate. Last January, the silver price had fallen to around 13 pence, while the benchmark gold price had exceeded 700 taels.</p>
<p>Amidst this sharp decline in silver prices, U.S. Senator Pittman, leader of the Senate subcommittee investigating Sino-American trade, released an investigation report on February 21st. He proposed a resolution in the Senate, requesting President Hoover to convene a world conference to study the silver price issue. The U.S. Senate committee report recommended negotiating a silver loan of 100 million ounces of raw silver with the Chinese government. At that time, Chinese government advisor Lincoln also actively mediated to facilitate the agreement. However, due to differing opinions from various parties, the proposal was not implemented.</p>
<p>Whether the collapse of silver prices is beneficial or detrimental to China, a silver standard country, cannot be easily determined. In terms of monetary theory, the drastic fall in silver prices would severely impede trade between gold and silver standard countries. In other words, when silver prices fall, exports from silver-using countries should increase, and imports should decrease. However, during this period of global economic recession, reality often contradicts theory. The global economic downturn has depleted the purchasing power of various countries. Despite the significant disparity in gold and silver ratios, exports from silver-using countries have not increased in reality. Conversely, amidst the global recession, prices in various countries have generally declined. Although silver-using countries can slightly curb imports by taking advantage of the high gold/low silver opportunity, the effect of high gold/low silver has been offset by the fall in prices. Imports have not decreased. Furthermore, during periods of strong high gold/low silver trends, it is theoretically unfavorable for silver-using countries that are raw material producers and beneficial for silver-using countries that are industrialized. Considering China's current situation, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. However, due to the aforementioned abnormal import relationships, the drawbacks may not be readily apparent.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Beiping Political Council Continues Meeting to Discuss <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Political Council held a meeting this morning. All members in Beiping attended to discuss Zhang's resignation. Zhang spoke, saying that he had telegraphed the central government to request his resignation. Yesterday, Wang also telegraphed the Central Executive Committee. Given his current environment, he had no choice but to withdraw to fulfill Mr. Wang's aspirations. He has already instructed his subordinates to prepare for the handover. As soon as a replacement is found, he will leave Beiping. His attitude is resolute. The members advised him to prioritize local security and not to withdraw, but Zhang still expressed his determination to resign. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhang's urgent resignation telegram: To the Nanjing Luoyang National Government Military Committee and Executive Yuan: With limited talent, I have wrongly shouldered military responsibilities. I am pained and heartbroken by the daily increase in foreign aggression. I originally intended to endure humiliation and bear the heavy burden, to fulfill my duties to the best of my ability, to strive to improve the situation, and to await punishment. However, due to my limited knowledge and vision, things have gone against my wishes. I have been unable to provide effective assistance or achieve any significant results. Continuing to hold this position without contributing would be a source of shame. As the national crisis deepens, I feel ashamed and remorseful. I hereby request to be dismissed from my current post as Pacification Commissioner of Beiping, and that a more capable person be appointed to succeed me. I sincerely submit this request and await your orders. Zhang Xueliang, respectfully sealed. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although there were reports last night that Zhang Xueliang had transferred military, political, and financial powers to the committee, he did not want to resign from the three committee memberships. It is now learned that Zhang telegraphed Wang Jingwei and key figures in the Nanjing National Government this morning, requesting his resignation. If the National Government approves his request, Zhang will relinquish all positions and retire from public life. Zhang's telegram to the National Government stated that his service has been ineffective and unable to alleviate the current difficulties. If he clings to his position, the national situation will become even more difficult. Therefore, he requests to be dismissed from his post and that a replacement be selected. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In addition to key military figures, bankers, merchants, and other important individuals also appointed a delegation last night to visit Zhang, urging him to resign. Whether Zhang will relinquish all positions seems to depend on the final decision of the central government. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Zhang's Speech to Beiping-Tianjin Reporters <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang, Pacification Commissioner of Beiping, hosted a gathering for Beiping-Tianjin journalists at the Shuncheng Wang Mansion at 7:20 PM on the 8th, hosted by Zhu Guang and Mu Nengyi. After Zhang exchanged greetings with the reporters, the reporters asked questions one after another, mainly regarding the points made in Wang's telegram about demanding funds, coercion, and extortion, requesting Zhang to explain the truth so that the public could fairly judge the merits of the case. Zhang then stood up and spoke, stating in essence that before expressing his views, he must first make several statements. For the past two weeks, he has been under pressure from both public and private affairs and has been suffering from the flu, so his spirits are not good. Therefore, today he will only briefly mention to everyone what he wants to say. After Premier Wang's telegram arrived in Beiping, he was extremely surprised and did not know why Premier Wang sent this telegram. He was completely unaware of it beforehand and could not understand it afterward. However, Premier Wang is older than him and has more political experience, so naturally Premier Wang's views are superior and can prompt him to reflect. Today, he will only answer the questions asked by everyone with facts, hoping that the public will not misunderstand them as arguments driven by emotions. Regarding the sections in Wang's telegram about Shenyang and Jinzhou, he has a duty to defend the territory and is a frontier official of the government, so he is naturally duty-bound. If the government wants to punish him, he will not dare to refuse and will have no complaints. However, the Japanese have been plotting against the Northeast for a long time, and it is definitely not something that he alone or the Northeast alone can salvage. Secondly, speaking of the Northeast itself, he has had to endure hardship in the past and has never been willing to argue about it publicly. He has a special historical relationship with the Northeast, and he is determined not to allow it to continue in its current state. If Mr. Wang believes that the central government's policies are not working and dismisses him from his post, he will have no objection. Even if he is an obstacle to foreign policy, it is not necessary to dismiss him publicly. He can simply have someone express this to him, and he will gladly comply. Since the September 18th Incident, he has publicly resigned several times, but his resignations have not been approved. He has privately expressed his intention to resign more than once. The reason why he has not resolutely retired is that he secretly hopes to bring this case to a conclusion. Otherwise, the Northeast will be lost by him and cannot be recovered by him, and he will always feel that his responsibility remains unfulfilled and his conscience is uneasy, not to mention the ancestral graves. However, because he is unwilling to sacrifice the lives and property of others for his personal emotions and is unwilling to gamble the lives of his subordinates who have been with him through thick and thin for the title of national hero, he has been extremely cautious and absolutely不敢輕舉妄動. If the central government has a formal order, he has no choice but to obey the order because of his duties. If he is allowed to decide on his own, he cannot but assess his capabilities, weigh the pros and cons, and act according to his conscience. Furthermore, some friends have told him that Li Hongzhang, a great politician of China's past, faced extremely difficult challenges in his time. However, after several years or decades, the truth will eventually be revealed, and the final judgment will be made after his death. He is encouraged by this idea and acts accordingly. Otherwise, how can officials in the current situation, and officials who are facing such a national situation, satisfy the people? Otherwise, they must deceive the people and adopt a slippery, irresponsible approach. Regarding Wang's request to the central government for funds, he telegraphed the central government two months ago, requesting an allocation of five million. Later, Minister Song came to Beiping and also mentioned that the central government was facing financial difficulties and that issuing bonds and borrowing money were not easy. Song suggested that he could raise funds within the provinces under his jurisdiction or from the central government agencies in Beiping and Tianjin, and the central government would do its best to help. He believed that raising funds would increase the burden on the people and did not agree to implement it. Over the years, he has not increased taxes in North China due to financial difficulties, except for military and political reductions. There are facts to prove this. Therefore, there may be a misunderstanding in Premier Wang's telegram regarding the collection of funds. Premier Wang's telegram also mentioned the Ministry of Railways raising funds. He has never seized or forcefully extracted railway funds. In order to unify finances, how could he obstruct it? If he had seized the two railways as reported in the previous newspapers and not allowed the central government to interfere, he could have used them at will. Who knew that safeguarding the dignity of the country and maintaining the unified situation, after consulting with the central government, would lead to such a major dispute? This matter was based on the principle of Minister Song's consultation on raising funds within the scope of the central government agencies. Later, he discussed with the Beining Railway on how to raise funds. The Ministry of Railways should transfer the funds to the Ministry of Finance. Wang also expressed his approval. Director Gao Jiyi telegraphed the Ministry of Railways for instructions. Director Gu also replied. Then, Chief Accountant Zhang was sent to Beiping to negotiate. Director Gu then telegraphed, saying that Director Gao of the Beining Railway had telegraphed the Ministry, refusing to allocate the funds. Upon inquiring with Director Gao, Gao said that there was no such matter and no such telegram. He urged Gao to telegraph the Ministry of Railways again to make a request. Later, a staff member of the Ministry of Railways telegraphed Chief Accountant Zhang, saying that the Minister only allowed the PingSui and Beining Bureaus to allocate 350,000 in subsidies and ordered Gao to raise 2 million to be remitted to the Ministry for railway construction. This is the process of allocating 2 million yuan from the Ministry of Railways. Regarding the 3 million yuan for Rehe, representatives from Rehe submitted a proposal to the Political Council, requesting an allocation of funds for relief. Some people advocated adding a surcharge to the Changlu Salt funds. He and Mr. Li Shizeng did not agree because Rehe's funds could not be obtained at the expense of the people of Hebei. They could follow the precedent of the 17th year of the Republic and request assistance from the central government. Mr. Li was recommended to go to Beijing to negotiate. Li said that he could not delay for long and that Hu Ruoyu could be invited to go to Beijing together. Chief of Staff Li of Rehe was also recommended to go to Beijing to explain the situation of requesting subsidies. All of the above points have established precedents and minutes of the Political Council meetings to prove them. There are discrepancies in Premier Wang's telegram. Premier Wang's telegram also mentioned empty words and shifting responsibility. This fact is a misunderstanding. Because all the problems have not been resolved, it can only be said that there is responsibility, not that it has been shirked. When the Political Council decided to issue a declaration and sign it, his seat was on the right of the chairman. The chairman ordered him to sign, but because he was being polite, he signed his name in the middle. Then, Mr. Li was even more polite and signed his name after him. The other members signed in turn, so his name was at the forefront and led the signing. (He showed the original draft of the Political Council's declaration and signatures.) In short, this declaration was an expression of the common will of all the members, not something that he alone dared to use to shirk responsibility. Premier Wang's telegram also mentioned extravagance. He did not know where this expenditure was necessary. Not only has Mr. Wang not yet agreed to allocate the funds, but even if they were allocated, his subordinates would be monitoring them. The laws of the country would not allow him to spend them extravagantly. Furthermore, he will briefly explain to everyone matters other than those mentioned in Wang's telegram. He is currently in a difficult situation, with a mother-in-law above him and children below him. The daughter-in-law in the middle feels really difficult. When he asks the central government for funds, the central government can delay. When his subordinates ask him for funds, he cannot but be responsible for raising them. He once said that we should not rush for victory but should first have the determination to perish with the enemy. How can we resist for a long time without preparation? Some people said that when Mr. Wang came to Beiping last time, he was rude and offended him. He happened to be sick, and the Xiehe Hospital has a diagnosis to prove it. Over the past year, considering the political, military, and educational affairs of North China, as well as the disasters in the Northeast, the disaster officials, disaster victims, unemployed students, there is no place that does not need funds to handle affairs. He has been extremely distressed in raising funds, but the recipients are still insufficient or dissatisfied. He is extremely pained. In this difficult situation, all of our compatriots should be so enthusiastic about national affairs. Officials should fulfill their responsibilities. How can he dare to shirk his responsibilities because of difficulties? The central government ordered him to take care of the friendly troops in North China. Every time his troops are paid, he must first plan for the military pay of the Song and Pang armies. Because of his responsibilities, he cannot shirk them. If he does not treat the new and old troops the same, he can save a lot of money and not be in as difficult a situation as he is now. He is willing to be open and honest about everything. In short, he has felt eighteen points of difficulty in national affairs over the years. However, in order to preserve the dignity of the country, he is unwilling to disclose everything. Therefore, he ignores the misunderstandings in society and does not defend himself. However, he asks himself that he is not guilty and has fulfilled his responsibilities. Right and wrong will eventually be judged fairly. Why should he seek personal temporary satisfaction and disregard the dignity of the country and make a full announcement? Now, because Premier Wang is a senior official of the government, what he says is closely related to his personal history and reputation. Furthermore, because many friends of yours and mine have asked questions, he has to carefully say a part of what can be made public. There are many other things in his heart and past facts, but because they are too concerned with the dignity of the country, it is really inconvenient to make them public. In the future, when there is no relationship or after a hundred years, he will definitely let future generations know it in detail. He is definitely not being angry. He is determined to resign because of the environmental situation. Regarding the security of North China, it is best to invite Mr. Jiang to be responsible. However, during the period of suppressing bandits, we cannot abandon the work that has been done, and he will be responsible to the end in the short term when there is no replacement. He has asked Mr. Jiang and the government to set a grand plan as soon as possible and send personnel to take over his duties for the sake of the overall situation. Mr. Wang is a pillar of the party and the country, and he must not be allowed to leave. Regardless of right or wrong, even if Mr. Wang has a telegram, for the sake of national welfare, he can only retire to fulfill Mr. Wang's aspirations. He also hopes that Mr. Wang must dispel his intention to resign and think of the country. He has to ask Mr. Wang to return to the capital as soon as possible. He asks himself again and again and thinks that he has made many mistakes in the country in recent years, causing the government to worry, causing his subordinates and friends to suffer, and even causing himself pain. All of this is because he is young and has not read enough books, and his nature is honest and straightforward. Everything is wrong because of his frankness, lack of political experience, and only knows the prejudice of patriotism. He does not understand the ways of the world and human nature, which causes many difficulties. He always does not understand why those who do not love the country can stay in their position. Today, he knows the taste of it. He is very sad in his heart. If it were not for the two words of patriotism, the Zhang family and his son would not have today's results, life and property would be lost, creating hatred for the neighboring country on the outside and being spurned by the people on the inside. Therefore, he must study again and seek knowledge extensively. Fortunately, he is young and strong and has a long future to serve the country. He earnestly hopes that the people of the country will not misunderstand Mr. Wang because of this incident. The reason for this incident is mostly because he is young and unable to undertake a major task. Therefore, there are many absurdities and mistakes in the country, which caused Mr. Wang to be angry and leave. From now on, we must take care of the overall situation of the country and must make Mr. Wang continue to work hard to lead us and strive forward. As a member of the people, in the period of national crisis, he only seeks to benefit the country and is willing to follow the people and do his best to fulfill his responsibilities.

<p>(Jinan) Jiang Bocheng arrived in Jinan from Beiping at 9:00 AM this morning. Han and various important people went to the station to greet him. Jiang said that Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, in light of Wang and Zhang's resignations, considered Chairman Han to be the center of gravity in North China. Therefore, he ordered him to come to Jinan to seek Han's opinion. Han expressed that he would take the Commander-in-Chief's opinion as his own. Regarding Zhang's resignation to take responsibility, he believed it was open and upright. When he left Beiping yesterday, he received a phone call from Zhang at the station, saying that he had not yet received a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief. Zhang said that he was suffering and had no way out, and that resigning was a good thing. The generals in Beiping did not express any opinion on Zhang's resignation and decided to persuade Wang to stay. The Commander-in-Chief's opinion is not known. Han also told reporters that he had no particular opinion on Wang and Zhang's resignations but believed that in the face of the urgent national crisis, the pillars of the country should not resign. The telegram persuading Wang to stay will be sent out today, and the overall situation in North China will not be affected. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The entire Beiping Political Council decided to jointly reply to Wang with a telegram, explaining Wang's telegram. It can be telegraphed tonight. The main points: (1) The previous declaration of the Political Council was discussed by all the members present and signed in person, and telegraphed to the central government in advance. Wang replied with approval. Zhang was only one of the signatories. How can he be blamed for this? (2) To relieve the financial difficulties of Rehe Province, representatives from Rehe proposed it at the conference. The committee unanimously decided to give relief quickly. Therefore, Li Shizeng was recommended to go to Beijing with the responsible personnel to discuss everything in person. The telegram sent to the central government only mentioned Rehe's financial difficulties and the importance of the relationship and requested relief. The telegram said that it was requesting 3 million per month but did not know what it was based on. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain source, after Zhang Xueliang submitted his resignation, the central government will approve it. However, the handling of various issues after the resignation is the focus of the central government's consideration. It is heard that in the military direction, it is decided to take over in the name of the Military Committee first and then select senior officials to take over. Other issues are also being discussed step by step and will require considerable consideration before a concrete decision can be made. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Whether the central government approves Zhang Xueliang's resignation remains to be seen. Foreign observers here believe that this new development may ease the tense situation in which the Japanese are planning to take action in North China. The Japanese will take a passive attitude when the situation is uncertain. Chinese and foreigners are now speculating on who will succeed Zhang after he leaves. Yan Xishan and Han Fuju are both mentioned, with Han being more likely. It is said that if Zhang's resignation is approved, the succession issue will be a point of contention between Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei. Chiang is in favor of Han. The Chinese are now paying attention to the results of persuading Wang to withdraw his resignation and the central government's decision on Zhang. Many believe that the central government's intentions will depend on Chiang Kai-shek, and Zhang has now sent his personal representative to meet with Chiang. At the same time, they feel that it is tragic that the League of Nations Lytton Commission is still in Beiping when there is a showing of disunity. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) When asked for the Japanese embassy's opinion on the political situation in North China, the Japanese embassy officially stated that the Japanese have no relationship with China's internal affairs. What they are concerned about is only the tranquility of North China affected by any changes in the near future. The Japanese embassy hopes that if there is a transfer of power, it will be done completely passively. Some people claim that this proves that the Japanese are very concerned about the nature of the transfer of power after Zhang Xueliang's true resignation. Many believe that Yan Xishan may not be able to succeed Zhang because if Yan seizes power, he will introduce the power of the Northwest Army, which will block Zhang's chances of regaining power in the future. At present, Zhang's relationship with Han Fuju is closer than before. If Han succeeds Zhang, it may be on the condition that he obeys Zhang's future restoration of power. It is well known that Zhang is not liked by the Japanese military authorities. The Japanese military authorities have goodwill towards both Yan and Han, but because Yan is disliked by Zhang, he may not be selected. Because of these twists and turns, many feel that the nature of the transfer of power in the future is as important as whether Zhang's resignation from all positions is accepted by Chiang.

<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin telegraphed the central government, reporting that Wang's intention to resign was firm and that there were no substantial results from the persuasion. He is still continuing to persuade him sincerely in order to save the difficult situation. After receiving He's telegram, the central government is now working hard to find a remedy. The central committee members in Nanjing believe that Wang's resignation has a considerable reason and that formal persuasion may not be effective. It is necessary to study the root cause and find an appropriate solution in order to avoid administrative obstacles so that there can be hope of reversing the situation. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

You are a pillar of the party and the country and the hope of the people. In February of this year, when the enemy was deeply entrenched, you resolutely took on the arduous task, showing steadfastness and surpassing others. For half a year, you have worked hard and diligently, making great contributions. How can you suddenly have the intention to withdraw midway when the grand plan is about to be implemented? The government and the people have both lost their reliance, and the world's opinion has suddenly felt uneasy. Moreover, the foreign troubles are deepening, and the internal worries have not subsided. Virtuous people in this situation will inevitably be unwilling to abandon them. Your request to resign should not be discussed. I hope you will still uphold your original intention to save the country when you took office and return to the Executive Yuan as soon as possible to preside over the overall plan to comfort the people.

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee members in Beijing sent a telegram to Chairman Lin earlier, reporting President Wang's resignation and requesting him to return to Beijing and go to Shanghai to persuade him to stay, hoping for significant results.

<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that Wang, in response to Chairman Lin's telegram invitation, is scheduled to return to Beijing from Shanghai on the evening of the 9th. After arriving tomorrow morning, he will not stay long and will immediately proceed to Lushan. Chiang will also go to Lushan from Hankou at the same time to discuss major national policies and solutions to the current situation. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources, Song Ziwen is determined not to take the position of President of the Executive Yuan, not even in an acting capacity. He has expressed his unwillingness and only hopes that this issue can be resolved as soon as possible. He plans to go to Hankou within days to meet Chiang, and then go to Lushan to meet Lin to discuss everything. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo told visitors that according to law, Wang's resignation should be followed by the Vice President acting in his place. If the Vice President is not present, the Minister of the Interior should act. However, Song sent telegrams to the Central Government, the National Government, and Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou, urging them to quickly decide on a successor for the President of the Executive Yuan so that the current Central Political Council can make a decision. Song intends to invite Wang and Chiang to schedule a meeting with Chairman Lin in Lushan for consultation. However, Wang stated that since he has already resigned, there is no need to go to Lushan for consultation. He will only return to Beijing to report after the Central Government approves his resignation. The meeting between Lin, Wang, and Chiang in Lushan is likely speculation, but it is also possible that speculation may become reality. Wang believes that if the Central Government approves Zhang's resignation, He Jingzhi or Zhu Peide could be selected to take charge of military affairs in North China. However, this issue is significant because it is uncertain whether Zhang is sincerely retiring and whether the Central Government will approve his resignation. Based on the current situation, one of the following three solutions must be chosen: (1) remove Zhang and retain Wang, (2) remove Wang and retain Zhang, (3) remove both Wang and Zhang. Comparatively, removing Wang is easier. Removing Zhang and retaining Wang will inevitably cause difficulties, as Zhang commands 200,000 to 300,000 troops. Once he steps down, the attitude and handling of his subordinates will become a problem. However, given the urgency of the national crisis, if a thorough solution is not sought, all difficulties are not overcome, and a new situation is not opened up, the country's future will be hopeless. Therefore, it is highly hoped that the Central Government will make a swift and appropriate decision. Zhang, under the guise of resistance, is engaged in various propaganda while also compromising with the enemy. This is evidenced by the fact that Zhang's garrison inside Yuguan was originally very strong. Although Chinese flags still fly on the city gates, Yuguan Railway Station has long fallen into enemy hands and is guarded by Japanese military police, with traitorous puppet flags displayed. Zhang has kept this secret and has not reported it, not only violating the Central Government's order to resist but also deceiving our 400 million compatriots, which is truly heartbreaking. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo said that although Wang has been urged to stay by the Central Government and various parties, he knows that Wang is determined not to come to Beijing and highly recommends Mr. Cai Yuanpei to succeed as President of the Executive Yuan. He telegraphed Chiang yesterday to seek his agreement. However, it is not yet known whether Cai is willing to take the position. Song Ziwen and Huang Shaoxiong are both unwilling to act as President of the Executive Yuan. He will resign and leave Beijing after the new President is produced. He is deeply saddened by the current situation. However, with the foreign invasion pressing, he sincerely hopes that a solution can be found soon, so that the central government has a leader and the political situation does not become unstable.

Among them was a telegram to Song Ziwen, stating that due to the non-payment of 2 million yuan for the purchase of machinery, the goods could not be delivered. He requested that Song communicate with Gu Mengyu and first borrow 2 million yuan from the Beining Railway. If they insisted on refusing, the Ministry of Railways would transfer funds to the Ministry of Finance for appropriation. He later received a reply stating that after discussing with Wang, Gu had instructed the bureau to allocate the funds as requested. Subsequently, Wang telegraphed a change to Gu's telegram, stating that borrowing 2 million yuan from the Beining Railway was difficult. He had ordered the railway to advance three months of military subsidies. He replied to Luo to find a way to allocate assistance. Luo replied that he had met with Wang, Li Renchao, and Gu Mengyu for discussion, and they all agreed that the requested 2 million yuan should be allocated immediately.

Jinzhou's situation is critical. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to today's Chinese telegraphs, the Volunteer Army in the three Eastern Provinces continues to win victories. Jinzhou is currently under siege. Although the Japanese army used smoke bombs to repel the enemy, it was ineffective. Jinzhou has become an isolated city due to railway blockades and telegraph cuts.

Upon hearing of the incident, the Chinese and Japanese authorities rushed to the scene to suppress the conflict. Several people on both sides were injured. (9th Japanese United News Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) The dangerous project at Dama House in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has seen a drop of more than two feet in the water level for several consecutive days. The large embankment has stopped collapsing. Various sections have been reinforced and are two to three feet above the water. The project's situation has become stable. Han telegraphed Zhang Lianjia, urging him to make efforts to protect the project and ensure its safety. Today, the water level at Luokou dropped 7 centimeters, with a water level of 28 meters, 43 centimeters. The upper reaches are also experiencing a drop in water level. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) He Chengjuan submitted a report to Chiang regarding the handover of his provincial seal and requested a thorough investigation into his time in office and the fraudulent acquisition of water conservancy funds by the Sichuan Jianglong Company. Headquarters issued an order on the 9th, stating that the official had been in charge of his hometown during a time of natural disasters and man-made calamities. The local gentry and people, eager for improvement, may have been overly critical and demanding. However, as long as the official's conscience is clear and he has no ulterior motives, there is no need to worry about public opinion. As for the Sichuan Jianglong Company's bankruptcy and the water conservancy funds, the Headquarters has already sent personnel to the Water Conservancy Bureau to review the files. During his tenure, the official was able to fulfill his supervisory responsibilities, separately pursuing compensation for the debts owed by Sichuan Jianglong. The use of funds by the Water Conservancy Bureau was also carefully organized. In the future, the entire case will be thoroughly investigated, and the truth will surely come to light. However, the official is responsible for pacifying Hubei and should urge his subordinates to make efforts to suppress the bandits and communists in order to stabilize the region. When the great unrest is quelled and his contributions are recognized, the external slanders will naturally cease. He should encourage himself. (9th Dispatch)</p>

There has never been a preparation office established for the Central Committee to convene a plenary meeting, and there is no plan to convene a National Assembly at this time, let alone drafting organizational laws.

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>United States Secretary of State</p>
<p>Reiterates Far East Foreign Policy</p>
<p>States the Process of Concluding the Non-War Treaty Reuters, New York, 8th - Secretary of State Stimson stated in a speech to the Foreign Relations Council today that he believed the Briand-Kellogg Pact would become one of the permanent policies of the United States. Stimson detailed the origins of the treaty, saying critics who call it not a treaty but a bundle of unilateral declarations from signatory nations are wrong, as the treaty does contain concrete promises. Stimson continued by talking about the Sino-Japanese conflict in the three northeastern provinces, saying the US declared to China and Japan that the US would not recognize any situation created by violating the League of Nations charter and the obligations of the Paris Treaty. This view was later adopted by the League of Nations, supported by 50 countries. The US government's actions appealed to a shared new sentiment. The fact that all civilized nations share a common position on this matter creates new meaning, and when moral opposition becomes opposition from the whole world, it creates a new meaning unprecedented in international law.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 8th - Secretary of State Stimson stated in a speech to the Long-Term Cooperation Committee today that the main purpose was that the global hope for peace expressed by the Briand-Kellogg Pact should be backed by public opinion sanctions. If the signatory countries see a threat of violation of the pact, they have a responsibility to help each other. Stimson described the peaceful situation for three years from the signing of the pact to the Manchurian Incident in 1932, with the main points of Stimson's speech roughly as follows: Public opinion is the sanction for all international relations, and its effectiveness depends entirely on whether each nation sincerely wants to make it effective. If each nation wants it to be effective, then the power of public opinion is irresistible. Any country appealing to public opinion must follow the appeal with mutual discussion and consultation between countries in order to be effective. Since the European War, the facts of organizing international peace have emerged endlessly, and they have all passed in a blink of an eye. Stimson briefly described the process and said that from the beginning of international law until the European War, the foundation of international relations could not escape the possibility of war. The conclusion of the Briand-Kellogg Treaty was a revolution in human thought. This treaty is not just a declaration of sincerity, but a binding treaty. It prohibits engaging in war except for legitimate self-defense. The treaty binds the meaning it should have, and it has it completely. Stimson finally said that the United States firmly believes in the value of the treaty, so it is willing to maintain it sincerely.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 9th - Yesterday's speech by US Secretary of State Stimson to the Foreign Relations Council in New York has made a deep impression on people in the League of Nations, who believe that Stimson's mention of the Non-War Pact is intended to request that the pact be applied to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Given the current situation, it is possible that the League of Nations Assembly will adopt the so-called "Stimson Doctrine" in the future to deal with the Far East incident. The Stimson Doctrine is that the use of force to change territory is not recognized.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - An editorial in the Times roughly stated that US Secretary of State Stimson's explanation of the US's attitude towards the Non-War Pact and his mention of the dispute in the three northeastern provinces can be regarded as a very important discussion by the US government announcing its foreign policy. The US government believes this has a special relationship with the situation that arises when the Lytton Investigation Team submits its report. The policy disclosed by Stimson has considerable value and importance in the entire future of international relations. The Manchester Guardian also wrote an editorial, stating that the effectiveness of the Non-War Pact has been tested, but although the signatory countries protested, Japan still occupies the entire territory of the three northeastern provinces. The United States and the member states of the League of Nations are all bound by the policy of not recognizing the situation in the three northeastern provinces, but this may not be able to effectively interfere with the implementation of Japan's aggressive policy. However, world public opinion has already changed.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th - The New York Times commented on Secretary of State Stimson's remarks, stating that these remarks are of the utmost importance, not only because they announce the US's adherence to the principle of consultation with other countries, but also because the publication of these remarks comes at a time when the League of Nations Assembly is about to meet again to deal with the complex issues related to peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 9th - When US Secretary of State Stimson discussed the effectiveness of the Non-War Treaty at the Foreign Relations Council yesterday, he called Japan an aggressor. This morning, after receiving the telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was very indignant, saying that Japan is refraining from excessive diplomatic negotiations because the United States is currently electing a president, but Secretary of State Stimson is discussing the Sino-Japanese issue. As a responsible Secretary of State, it cannot be said that his words were not carefully considered. Therefore, it has been decided to lodge a major protest to urge Stimson to reflect.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 8th - Today, the US Department of State is quite anxious about the situation in which Japan may invade the Beiping area. According to news from Beiping, the diplomatic corps there is currently considering what the consequences will be if the embassy guards and Chinese troops engage in battle outside Beiping City. From the American standpoint, the situation is quite thorny, as Colonel Hawke of the US Marine Corps is the most senior of the foreign military attaches stationed in China. If the situation becomes critical, he will be elected as the commander of the guards of various countries.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 8th - US Democratic Senator Stevenson, after returning home from attending the Disarmament Conference in Geneva, met with reporters for the first time today. It is said that the success or failure of this winter's disarmament conference will depend on the situation in Europe. He is deeply concerned that Japan's recent opposition to disarmament will become a hidden reef hindering efforts to reduce armaments, and the continued tension in Europe and the Far East will further strengthen the Japanese people's determination.</p>

<p>Adding Airfields and Building New Artillery Forts in Taiwan</p>
<p>Intensifying Military Exercises to Prevent Rear Instability</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch, 1st - According to a report from the Tokyo Industrial Labor Communications Office, Japan is preparing for war against the United States in Taiwan with great urgency. The situation is listed as follows: (A) (Building New Military Transportation and Airfields) (1) A new airfield is being established in Dongshi Township, Tainan Prefecture. (2) New ship connections are being added between Kaohsiung and Magong (naval bases), with the Iki Maru going into service. (3) New radio communications are being opened between Taipei and Manila. (4) A large suspension bridge dedicated to military trucks is being built in Yilan and Zhuoshui Creek, which began construction this spring. (5) Preparations are being made for flight connections between Japan and Taiwan, with scheduled air routes planned for this autumn or next spring. (6) Expanding Jiatung Airfield. The airfields in Taiwan include Pingtung, Jiatung, Dongshi, Lukang, Tamsui, Taipei, and Hualien Port. (B) (New Artillery Forts Built at Xiadahuli) Japan built a new artillery fort in Xiadahuli, Dayuan Village, Taoyuan County, Taipei Prefecture, before the Shanghai incident this spring, and stationed a heavy artillery unit there. A military motor road three feet six inches wide was opened between Xiadahuli and Taoyuan, and villagers were not allowed to pass through. Taiwanese newspapers were also prohibited from reporting on it. Villagers who talked about the Japanese army building artillery forts were detained for 20 days. (C) (Revitalizing Military Industry) A lot of kerosene and gasoline are used during wartime, and the military ordered the Japan Petroleum Company to add</p>
<p>oil extraction equipment in Jinzhou. (D) (Intensifying Military Exercises) (1) The Pingtung Air Force squadron trains every day. On February 10, they trained in Taipei to guard Taipei. From March 8 to 10, there were connection flights between Pingtung and Hualien Port. On March 10, an island-wide defense exercise was held. On March 22 and 23, the Magong Fortress conducted field exercises. On March 31, exercises were conducted in Kaohsiung to suppress the rise of revolutionary forces. In May, exercises were conducted to control the lights on Magong Street. In June, large-scale military exercises and revolutionary force suppression exercises were conducted in various places. (E) (Increasing Police to Suppress Speech) This year, the political police expenses were increased by 60,000 yuan. The Keelung Maritime Police Department increased the number of police officers by 35. Passengers traveling to and from the ship must undergo four checks by the maritime police, the military police, the ordinary police, and the police in the place they are going to. In particular, Taiwanese people returning to Taiwan from Shanghai were often imprisoned and interrogated. During the Shanghai Incident, those who talked about the defeat of the Japanese army in the Shanghai Incident in public were detained and interrogated for at least 20 days.</p>

<p>Reorganizing the System for the Invasion of Manchuria</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 9th - The army greatly replaced 1,291 officers yesterday, but those related to the Kwantung Army have not yet been announced. According to general criticisms, General Muto Nobuyoshi concurrently holds three important positions in the Kwantung region, and its meaning is very profound. General Muto is a taciturn person who is familiar with the situation in Manchuria. This is the second time he has been appointed as the commander of the Kwantung Army. The newly appointed Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, former Vice Minister of the Army, Lieutenant General Iso Ko, is the only politician in the army. Since the May 15th Incident, the activities of the army have been guided entirely by the Lieutenant General. During his time as a junior officer, he studied the Manchurian problem and was one of the few Mongolian experts in the department. Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Okamura Ningji is an extremely capable practitioner. Two-thirds of his army life has been spent in China, so he is also the only China expert. Lieutenant General Honjo Shigeru was transferred to the position of military counselor to reward his achievements since September 18 last year. It is rare for a Lieutenant General to serve as a counselor. In short, on the one hand, it is to reward meritorious service since the Manchurian Incident, and on the other hand, it is to prepare the army's response to Manchuria in conjunction with the establishment of Manchuria.</p>
<p>Japanese United News Agency, Tokyo, 9th - The newly appointed leaders of the Kwantung Army, Commander Muto, Chief of Staff Iso, Deputy Chief of Staff Okamura, Staff Officer Saito, and Senior Aide-de-Camp Shinohara, held a meeting at the Prime Minister's residence at 9:30 this morning to discuss the tasks to be carried out in the future. Okamura and Shinohara are scheduled to leave for their posts via Dalian on the 14th. General Muto and other officers are scheduled to leave for Shenyang via Korea on the 21st.</p>

<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 9th - At today's cabinet meeting, the Japanese government decided to appoint Shuuichi Nagaoka, Ambassador to France, Naotake Sato, Ambassador to Belgium, and Shichiro Yada, Minister to Sweden, as representatives of Japan to attend the League of Nations General Assembly to be held in Geneva in September.</p>

<p>Advocates Reforming the Imperial Household System</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 9th - Today's newspapers prominently published news that former Minister of the Imperial Household Tanaka demanded that Minister of the Imperial Household Makino and Minister of the Imperial Household Ichi ki resign. Tanaka believed that Makino and Ichiki should be held responsible for certain events that occurred in the past, and that if they remained in office, serious consequences might arise. The only newspaper that did not publish this news this morning was the Asahi Shimbun, so it is widely speculated that Tanaka's move may be related to the armed attack on the Asahi Shimbun building by reactionary parties in April 1928. The reason why Asahi was attacked that year was because it refused to publish a declaration criticizing Makino and Ichiki for failing to take strict measures to suppress new ideas that were shaking the foundation of the country. Makino has been assassinated several times, and when Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated on May 15, a bomb was thrown into Makino's home.</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 9th - After the resignation of the former Minister of the Imperial Household, Count Tanaka Mitsuaki, Minister of the Imperial Household Ichiki and Deputy Minister of the Imperial Household Sekiya visited Tanaka Mitsuaki every day. It is reported that before resigning, Tanaka requested the Emperor to revise the system of the Imperial Household. The Imperial Household was shocked upon hearing this and sent Ichiki and Sekiya to earnestly request Tanaka to withdraw the request. Tanaka initially insisted on a tough stance, but after persuasion from various parties, he softened somewhat. The content of the reform is kept secret and cannot be ascertained.</p>

<p>Strictly Suppressing Terrorist Acts</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 9th - The German government issued two emergency orders today to strictly suppress political terrorist acts. The first order ordered all states to establish special courts (non-federal courts) to specifically hear all violent crime cases. The second order stipulates that anyone who commits riot, rebellion, arson, incitement to bombing, and causing floods, and damage to railway materials, will be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 9th - The political situation in Germany is still in great turmoil, and the parties are fighting as usual, but there are things that can be predicted. When the parliament opens on August 30, Prime Minister Papen and Minister of Defense Schleicher will definitely be in the government. The key to controlling the overall situation is the Catholic Center Party, which is chaired by former Prime Minister Brüning. The party can tolerate members of the National Socialist government, but only on the condition that they do not overstep their bounds. If they try to conduct experiments opposed by the Center Party, the Center Party intends to overthrow the government. The National Socialist Party will probably gain two smaller positions in the government and promise them more important positions in the future.</p>

<p>Reuters, Argentina Capital, 9th - Other South American countries have unanimously decided that if Bolivia firmly declares war on Paraguay, these countries will impose an economic blockade on the two warring countries. According to semi-official sources, the Argentine government is currently working with other South American governments to study possible coercive plans to prevent the war. However, the blockade also has obstacles, as the trade between the ports of the West Coast and Bolivia and Paraguay sees the Plata River as important. However, if Argentina and Chile agree to the blockade, the two warring countries will be in dire straits from the beginning.</p>
<p>Reuters, Argentina Capital, 9th - Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru signed an agreement yesterday, promising to remain neutral in the Bolivia-Paraguay conflict and at the same time urging the two countries to make every effort to maintain peace. All relevant countries in this agreement promised not to recognize land occupied as a result of the war. Two Bolivian army aviators were forced to land and are currently being detained by Paraguayans.</p>

<p>And Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Persuade Him</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, After Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Hankou on June 28, he went to Xun twice in the middle, and is now supervising the suppression of the Red Army in various provinces to thoroughly clear all the bandits. However, on the 6th, he received a telegram from the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, resigning. Wang also asked Chiang to return to Beijing to preside over the Central Political Conference. That night, Chiang immediately sent an urgent telegram to Mr. Wang, earnestly urging him to stay. The general idea of the original telegram was: Since we have all come to face the national crisis together, no matter what difficulties there are now, we must bear the responsibility together and bravely overcome the difficulties. We must not have the idea of resigning hastily at a time when the national crisis is becoming more serious. We hope that you will return to Beijing immediately and preside over the affairs of the Yuan as usual. At the same time, he telegraphed Chairman Lin in Guling, asking him to persuade him to stay, and separately telegraphed He Yingqin in Nanjing, Wu Techeng and Song Ziwen in Shanghai to jointly persuade him to stay. On the afternoon of the 7th, Chiang also summoned Wang Shijie, the president of Wuhan University, to his official residence in Yihua Village, and instructed him to telegraph Shanghai to ask Cai Yuanpei to persuade Wang to return to Beijing to avoid a lack of responsible person in the central government. After receiving the instruction, Wang immediately telegraphed Cai to persuade him to stay. The telegram said: Mr. Wang resigned, and no one can succeed him. The League of Nations meeting is approaching, and the central government should not be shaken. Mr. Jieshi specifically asked me to ask you to do your best to persuade Mr. Wang to return to Beijing no matter what. I hereby convey this to you. On the 8th, the Shanghai telegram conveyed that Wang's intention to resign had not been dispelled. Chiang then sent Wuhan University professor Zhou Gengsheng as a representative to Shanghai to persuade him in person. Zhou took the Jiangyu ship east on the evening of the 8th. When he passed through Beijing, he would invite Tang Youren to go to Shanghai together, because Chiang had no intention of returning to Beijing for the time being. (August 8)</p>

<p>Japanese troops in all areas are adopting a defensive posture. A dispatch from Beiping states that, according to sources within the Volunteer Army, the various Volunteer Armies of Liaoning and Ning provinces have begun a general offensive against the Japanese army. Shenyang and Jinzhou are both showing signs of wavering. Reports received over the past few days are as follows:</p>
<p>The Fourth Route Volunteer Army of Zheng Guilin on the Fengshan Line, in Jinxi, has been fighting the Japanese army in the vicinity of Suizhong and Xingcheng along the railway line for days. They have dismantled four or five miles of the pseudo-Fengshan railway, at a location two *li* west of Lianshan Station. The Japanese armored train stationed at the station fired upon them. The pseudo-Fengshan railway train arriving at Shanhaiguan was delayed by four hours. The Eighth Division Volunteer Army of Ma Zidan in Yixian on the northern route has also been engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army near Chaoyang Temple and Liulongtai Village for days. The independent regiment of Li Haifeng, in conjunction with the various units of Liu Chunqi, has been advancing fiercely from Hongluoxian in Jinxi since the 3rd, intending to encircle Jinzhou. Great panic prevails in that area. Volunteer Armies in Goubangzi, Qingduizi, and Dahushan are also engaging the Japanese army. The First Division Volunteer Army of Wang Shu on the northern route has occupied Tongliao. Traffic on the branch line of the pseudo-Fengshan railway has been suspended. The Lao Beifeng unit at Dahushan, Dongbaiqibao, and Raoyang River has also risen up to fight the Japanese army.</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway: The Volunteer Army on the South Manchuria Railway has destroyed much of the railway line. Traffic on the South Manchuria Railway has been suspended. On the branch line from Yingkou to Goubangzi, between Tianzhuangtai and Panshan, a large force of the Volunteer Army attacked Majiayingzi, twelve *li* north of Yingkou from Tianzhuangtai on the 5th, capturing a Japanese tank. Twenty *li* from Shenyang, large forces of the Volunteer Army are concealed in the sorghum fields and have begun attacking the Japanese army. The main force of the Volunteer Army is advancing towards Shenyang. Fierce fighting is expected in Shenyang in the coming days. Regarding the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Line, the Japanese previously used the arrest of Ishimoto Kenshiro as a pretext to station considerable troops at Chaoyang Temple Station. It is rumored that Japanese Lieutenant General Muto will take command of the Jinxi military operations to rescue Ishimoto. Traffic on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Line has been suspended for several days. Moreover, a certain party has released detailed information on the fierce fighting between the various Volunteer Armies and the enemy,</p>
<p>as follows:</p>
<p>Haicheng: (1) After receiving orders to operate on schedule, our army of the First Route began preparations. On the night of the first day, it mobilized various units to positions north, west, and south of Haicheng Station on the South Manchuria Railway, launching an encirclement attack. Around midnight, they made contact with the Japanese garrison stationed there, resulting in fierce fighting. After about half an hour, the vanguard of our army had approached the station to within about two hundred paces, but due to the presence of electric fences set up by the Japanese army, our army could not penetrate further. (2) In order to cut off Japanese reinforcements from Liaoyang and Dashiqiao, and to implement a policy of terror, our forces divided into two detachments to harass Nantai, about twenty *li* south of Haicheng, and Liujiatun, about twenty *li* north, creating disturbances. Contact was made at dawn on the 2nd, and the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. They have apparently requested assistance from Liaoyang and Dashiqiao. (3) On the 2nd</p>
<p>in the afternoon, our army changed its attack direction with full force, attacking the Japanese railway concession, the base of the Japanese army in Haicheng. They cooperated in the attack from the north and south starting at 8:00 PM, immediately breaking in and engaging in chaotic street fighting with the local garrison, puppet police, and Japanese police. Japanese women and children within the concession fled in droves. Our army was ordered not to harm them. Our army's momentum was strong, and the Japanese artillery units retreated in two groups. Japanese reinforcements from Dashiqiao have arrived and are now in formal contact with our army, currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Liaoyang: Our army, under the command of Wang Quansheng, consisting of 5,000 men, moved from the Dashaling and Huangniwa areas on the 29th, appearing and disappearing intermittently. At dawn on the 31st, they officially went into action, burning a railway bridge on the Japanese South Manchuria Railway, cutting its long-distance telephone lines, and engaging Japanese sentries. They planned to destroy the Japanese water source in Shoushan, the iron mine in Anshan, and the Japanese station in Liaoyang. According to intelligence, Japanese military police, police, and puppet police in Anshan, Shoushan, Zhangtaizi, and Shilihe, along with local Japanese veterans, have set up electric fences and sandbags around the local water source, mine, bank, substation, and</p>
<p>station and are on guard all night.</p>
<p>Yingkou: The Lao Beifeng unit, numbering about 5,000, launched a powerful night attack on the old urban area of Yingkou from Niujiatun at 4:00 AM on the first day. They charged in under the cover of darkness and engaged in battle with the Japanese military police and puppet police. The sounds of gunfire were intense and the sound of artillery fire could be heard throughout the city. The Japanese were extremely alarmed by the intensity of the National Salvation Army's attack. Japanese banks, shops, and Japanese civilians and soldiers throughout the city have sent their women and children to ships on the Liao River for safety, and have set up electric fences, maintaining a serious state of alert.</p>
<p>Panyang: A unit of our army is lying in wait in the Sujiatun area, waiting for an opportunity to act. On the 2nd, they arrested two Japanese Manchuria Railway inspectors, marking the beginning of our army's operations. Our army plans to attack Shenyang in the near future and has already made considerable preparations on the southern and eastern sides of the northeast. Plainclothes units have been deployed inside the city to act as internal support. Action will begin soon.</p>
<p>Changchun: At around 7:00 PM on the 30th, according to intelligence from the puppet police, approximately 1,000 infantry and cavalry of the Wang Delin National Salvation Army suddenly appeared in the southern part of Changchun as an advance guard. The main force of about 8,000 was about forty *li* behind. Judging by their direction of movement, they appeared to be planning an attack on Changchun. The Japanese military police and puppet military police in Changchun are now cooperating in maintaining security. In addition, the Changchun air squadron dispatched a light bomber carrying bombs to Nanling to bomb the local National Salvation Army. Martial law has been declared in Changchun, and many so-called important figures of the puppet organization have taken refuge at the Japanese station.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Plot to Disturb Tianjin Fails <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Sun Yichen Succeeds Liu Xuegu Tianjin Dispatch: After the *hanjian* Liu Xuegu was arrested on the 5th, Wang Yimin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, personally escorted him to Beiping, removing a hidden danger for the region, to the great satisfaction of the people. However, Sun Yichen, the deputy leader of the plainclothes squad (Sun had served as the Tianjin *daoyin* when Chu Yupu was the military governor of Zhili), was extremely shocked. On the one hand, he reported to the military police and constabulary authorities of the Japanese concession, requesting a protest to the Public Security Bureau, and on the other hand, he searched for spies within the plainclothes squad. As a result, the Japanese police station issued a major demerit to the patrolman on duty on Suma Street, Shianli, for failing to provide adequate protection, and requested the Japanese consulate to protest to the municipal government. However, as there was no corroborating evidence, the municipal government has not yet received a letter of protest. As for Sun Yichen's investigation of the plainclothes squad, it is said that he discovered several undercover special agents (this is the secret term for special forces), and immediately subjected them to harsh interrogation. Their subsequent whereabouts are unknown. Some say they have already been put to death. Yesterday (the 6th) evening at 6:00 PM, Sun convened an emergency meeting and decided to launch a riot at 9:00 PM on the 7th, and notified the armies that had been won over to launch a simultaneous uprising, and presumptuously claimed that they would occupy Beiping and destroy Zhang Xueliang's base. The Japanese military in Tianjin naturally strongly supported this plan. However, at 10:00 PM that night, the Japanese consulate suddenly urged the Japanese military to prevent troublemakers from causing disturbances in the Japanese concession. The Japanese Resident Association also knew that the plainclothes squad was weak and could not succeed, and advocated caution. The Japanese military then summoned Sun for questioning at midnight, rigorously questioning whether he was confident in the riot. Sun said he was confident and cited so-and-so brigade commander and so-and-so regimental commander who had signed written pledges to participate in the anti-Zhang movement. The Japanese military said that since he was confident, he could operate outside the Japanese concession, and the Japanese military would provide covert assistance. Sun, listening to this advice, could not help but feel apprehensive and decided to postpone the launch. However, yesterday (the 6th), the Japanese army suddenly prepared 10,000 sacks and transported sand and soil to empty houses outside Qiangzi River on Fukushima Street and stockpiled them, and also prepared a large quantity of electrical wiring material. Perhaps the Japanese army is actively planning to assist Sun's riot. (7th)</p>

<p>The Dispute over Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Continues: The auction of tobacco and alcohol licenses and the tobacco and alcohol business license tax were previously the subject of disputes between the provincial and central governments, leaving merchants at a loss. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance adopted a bidding system. It is said that a certain Yao has won the bid to manage the tobacco and alcohol license tax for this county and Qingjin County for 12,500 yuan. Unexpectedly, the county government received a telegram from the Department of Finance stating that the tobacco and alcohol license tax in this province would be managed by the province starting from July 1, and collection would be implemented, ordering all counties to assist. However, it is recently heard that many tobacco and alcohol merchants in various counties are still mostly waiting and seeing, and are not going to the various provincial bureaus to pay their taxes. This is partly due to the merchants' attempts to be opportunistic, but it also reflects the lack of assistance from the county magistrates. Provincial tax collection and provincial management should be consistent in name and reality. Before the method has been changed, the province should collect the tax according to the original plan. A telegram should be sent again ordering them to comply with repeated orders and provide sincere assistance, and to inform all tobacco and alcohol merchants to promptly go to the various provincial bureaus to pay their taxes according to regulations. If they still dare to resist and delay, they should be strictly pursued and collected, and the county should reissue a public notice to inform them and avoid self-destruction of their businesses, etc. The dispute over tobacco and alcohol business license tax between the ministry and the province is in full swing.</p>

<p>Gao Liao Suffers Poverty and Illness in Prison: In the case of the former San Francisco Deputy Consul Gao Ying and his wife trafficking in opium, Gao Ying has already served his sentence and been released from prison. His wife, Liao Suqiu, was originally sentenced to four years, but the sentence was reduced to two years on appeal. Now, after discounting the number of days in custody, the sentence is about to expire. She is awaiting release after the fine of 4,000 yuan is paid. However, Liao is suffering from poverty and illness, and her relatives and friends are ashamed of her. Her husband, Gao Ying, has also not sent any news for a long time. It is feared that it will be difficult to raise the fine.</p>
<p>Zhong Tingxi et al. Detained on Suspicion of Communism: Zhong Tingxi and five others from the station stevedores union were previously detained by Zhu Yanliang, the supervisor of the county party headquarters, in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau, on suspicion of communism, and sent to the High Court. Yesterday (the 9th), prosecutor Zhu Wenzhao investigated the case. As a result, Liu Jinkun, Xu Fangfu, Li Hengquan, and Huang Qiaobiao were found to be less involved and were released on bail in court. Zhong was returned to custody to await trial in the criminal court.</p>

<p>Changshu Chamber of Commerce Discusses Business Tax: The chambers of commerce of Wujin, Wuxi, Yixing, Jiangyin, and Jingjiang counties in the old Changzhou prefecture held a meeting at the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon to discuss the business tax issue. Representatives from various counties had arrived in advance. Since the promulgation of the Suzhou Provincial Provisional Regulations on Business Tax, all industries in Wuxi have complained that the tax rate has been increased to twice or one and a half times the old regulations. At a time when the market is in decline and business is depressed, they feel it is unbearable. They have put forward various opinions. Industries such as silk and cloth, paper, sauce and wine, and tea have requested that the tax be temporarily levied at 2/1000, the same as the grain and flour business tax. The Rice Industry Association argues that the industry holds a *yatie* (license) and has traditionally been a mix of retail and wholesale, or retail-only, purely adjusting agriculture and commerce, and is not a department store business. They request that the tax be levied based on capital, similar to the banking industry. All of these have been submitted to the general meeting, which has decided to ask the Chamber of Commerce Federation to argue the case based on reason. In addition, the chambers of commerce of the various counties under the Suzhou prefecture held a meeting in Suzhou on the afternoon of the 8th. As a result, it was decided to proceed in accordance with the six points decided by the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation on the 6th of last month.</p>

<p>Daughter-in-Law Swallows Opium and Kills Herself After Being Humiliated by Mother-in-Law: Wu, the wife of Chen Da of Fanzhuang Township, Libao District, is naturally fierce. After she had a son, San Suo, she hired a matchmaker last year to marry a Shi girl from the Ding family as his wife. She was considered virtuous and the couple got along well. A few days ago, Wu was dissatisfied with something and quarreled with her daughter-in-law, subjecting her to great humiliation. In anger, the daughter-in-law swallowed opium in the night and killed herself. By the time her husband realized it, her life was already gone, and there was no way to bring her back to life.</p>

<p>Fire Breaks Out in Yantiwa Lane, Jiangdong: At Xin Yuanjia's house, number 23, Yantiwa Lane, Jiangdong, at around 10:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a fire suddenly broke out. Various fire brigades and carriage teams arrived on the scene to put out the fire. Due to the drought and water shortage, it took over an hour to extinguish the fire. The five rooms and one lane of the building where Xin lived were completely destroyed, with losses estimated at over 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Granddaughter-in-Law Chops Ninety-Year-Old Great-Grandfather to Death: Li Guoan, a farmer from the Shanmen area of Zhenhai, has a daughter named Ruixian, who is only seventeen years old and has a sinister nature. She was betrothed to a certain He, but Ruixian disliked her husband's ugly appearance and the couple often quarreled. One day, He returned from outside and spoke sweet words, intending to please his wife. Unexpectedly, Ruixian stabbed her husband with a needle, hitting He's eye and causing him to faint on the ground. As a result, Ruixian left. Since then, no matchmakers have come to her door. Zhang Xiaoyuan from Huangshimen, Shibei Township, had an adopted son. Hearing that Guoan had a daughter, he asked a matchmaker to arrange a marriage and betrothed her as a daughter-in-law. After passing through the door, Ruixian's old nature did not change. One day, Ruixian was in the back door, holding a kitchen knife and cutting vegetables, muttering to herself, filled with resentment. Her husband's grandfather, A San, was ninety-four years old, bent over, and came along tottering. Upon seeing Ruixian, he scolded her harshly, which aroused Ruixian's anger. She swung the kitchen knife in her hand and chopped him, hitting A San's brain. A San was old and lost too much blood and died in less than three hours.</p>
<p>Wang's Father and Son Kidnapped in Shangwang Village: Wang Huaicheng, a resident of Shangwang Village, Yinnan, is a farmer by trade and has a relatively comfortable life, which has attracted the attention of bandits.

Renbao, seeing the situation was not good, escaped through the back door. The bandits then went to Shangwang Village and kidnapped the farmer Wang Huaicheng and his son.</p>

<p>Comes to Shanghai for Medical Treatment Last Night to Show His Resolve</p>
<p>Chen Bulei, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department, has strived to maintain and gradually expand educational funding since taking office, at a time when educational funding has been extremely scarce. Previously, due to his weak health, he once submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to resign from his position as Director of the Zhejiang Education Department. However, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education made every effort to retain him, and he cancelled his resignation. It is now known that Chen is suffering from illness and urgently needs long-term recuperation, so he has once again submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to resign and request that another capable person be appointed to replace him. The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education believe that Chen has achieved considerable success in handling educational administration in Zhejiang. Although Chen has requested to resign due to illness, it is difficult to find a suitable successor for the time being, so they have repeatedly telegraphed him to earnestly retain him. However, Chen is eager to break free and take the opportunity to recuperate, so his determination to resign is unwavering. He took the train to Shanghai last night for medical treatment and may have to go to Beijing in the near future to personally request his resignation.</p>

<p>Sharp Drop of More Than Twelve Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, speculative gold suddenly reversed direction, with a dramatic decline. However, the market conditions were complex, with frequent fluctuations of two or three taels. In total, the daily range was about six and a half taels. Afterwards, there was a sharp drop of more than twelve taels, with divergent buying and selling and confused intentions among industry players. Ultimately, the market was weak. Silver prices saw a decline in London and an increase in New York, the opposite of the previous day. Futures silver prices surged, so the opening price immediately broke through 740 taels. Subsequently, with the short covering by Yifeng, Hengxing, and others, it reached a high. However, due to the unusual easing of foreign exchange, both the official and unofficial rates for the US dollar increased, and there were always sellers in the market, so the price fell again to 1.45 taels. Later, selling pressure intensified, and with the further strengthening of drafts, it continued to fall by three or four taels, finally settling at only 734 taels, with a pessimistic outlook for the market. The detailed course of the market before and after will now be recorded below.</p>
<p>Opening Plunge of 8.8 Taels</p>
<p>The September futures opened with a sharp drop of 8.8 taels to 737.3 taels. Although large bars fell by one-eighth, the price of American silver unexpectedly rose by one-eighth. The market was unstable, and there were continuous purchases from the United States, which further increased by 7/16 via private telegram. As a result, there were many sellers, and the market sentiment was extremely depressed. Subsequently, due to purchases from Guangbang Hengxing Yifeng and Yifeng Yongda Decheng Hengchang Yong Tong Taichang Heng Yuanyuan and others, the price increased by more than one tael to 39 taels. However, foreign speculators, such as Joe Joseph, sold, causing the price to drop by two taels to 37 taels. As the exchange rate eased, near-term rates were 30 yuan and far-term rates were 30.5 yuan. Then, Mai Bank absorbed 125 for September, Meifeng absorbed 4375 for November, and 25 for October. Yingjin HSBC and others bought 9375 for October. Moreover, the buying pressure in the market suddenly increased, with Hengxing Yifeng Hengxing Yuan Zhaofeng Chang Fuyu Heng Yu Hongkang Yong and others successively pulling in, so the price suddenly surged by more than three taels, reaching 40 taels and 4 qian at 9:30 AM. HSBC quoted British at par and American up 125, at 40 taels and 1 qian. Subsequently, the price increased by two or three qian. Ruixing Hengxing Yuan Yifeng Yong Hongkang Yong Zhifeng Yongyuan Kangxiang and others saw a surge in selling, causing the price to fall sharply by more than four taels to 36 taels. Before long, Yifeng Hengxing Yuan Qianchang Xiangyuan Maoyong Hengchang Yong Hengxing and others entered again and again. In August, US dollars could be sold at 0625, and Meifeng absorbed the November first order at nine pence. At 11 o'clock, the price was 39 taels, (only fluctuating by one tael from 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock). Afterwards, the situation deteriorated, with Hengyu Zhaofeng Chang Hengxing Yuan Hongkang Yong Futai Heng Fuyu Yuantai and other goods sets showing rampant selling pressure. Especially with the near-term first order being able to settle at 8125, US dollars at 0625, and Shanghai offering 30.5 yuan for far-term, McGillivary entered at 625. As a result, the price of gold could not stand firm, falling by three or four taels. It hovered slightly by one or two taels, and finally closed at 35.5 taels at noon. After a while, Yifeng came in, so the closing price was 6 taels and 7 qian, and it was made to 8 taels again. Then, the market sentiment was fluctuating and helpless.</p>
<p>Afternoon Selling Pressure Prevails</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 37.3 taels, then at 8.1 taels. Holland absorbed the October British gold at nine pence, and British entered 9375 for September. Later, the American merchant did 1875 for August, and Shanghai offered 375 for October. Also, Fuxing Yong Tong Taichang Hengxing Yuan Hengyu all offered 36.6 taels at 2:30, then added one tael and then fell by more than three taels, because Fuchang Fuyu Hengchang Yong Hengxing Yuan Zhaofeng Chang and others sold vigorously. As the exchange rate became particularly strong, with Mai Bank offering 191875 for November British gold, and the US dollar far-term at 30 yuan and 75, it was not easy to sell. At 3:10 PM, the price was 34 taels and 2 qian, then it increased by one tael to 5 taels and 3 qian, with retail investors coming in. After 3:30 PM, the market situation was ultimately difficult to improve. Bingxing Zhaofeng Chang Hongkang Yong Fuyu and others worked hard to sell. Near the closing time, it finally reached 33 taels and 9 qian. Then, at 4 o'clock, the closing price was 34 taels, falling more than 12 taels and 1 qian compared to the previous day. However, after the close, it rose to 4 taels, 7 or 8 qian. According to the largest price in a day, 40 taels and 4 qian, and the smallest price, 33 taels and 9 qian, there was a difference of 6 taels and a half. The red bar was calculated to increase by eight and a half taels.</p>
<p>Call Prices Mostly Suppressed by Ten Taels</p>
<p>The call price was changed to 807 taels, which was quoted at 125 taels, with a tap of 67, 8 taels to 71 taels, and 73 taels in the afternoon, which was about ten taels more than the previous day. The registered amount was 37 taels, the water compensation was 35 taels, and the after-market was 32 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions at Various Firms Were Extremely Chaotic</p>
<p>Transactions on the table were quite smooth, but each followed its own path, and it was chaotic and at a loss. It is calculated that Guangbang and Yifeng covered short positions of more than 1,000 bars, Hengxing more than 500 bars, Yuan Kangxiang and Zhaofeng Chang entered and then exited, Bingxing Zhifengyong Qianchangxiang Yifengyong Yuanyong Shunli all entered, Tongtaichang Hengxingyuan Hengyu and Fuyu had a lot of deposits and withdrawals, Hengchangyong entered more than 1,000 bars, Ruixing traded on behalf of Joe Joseph and Hongkangyong Yuantai and Futaiheng Yongfeng all exited. In the afternoon, Tongtaichang Dadecheng Qianchangxiang Yifeng and Yongfeng all entered, Yuanyong Zhifengyong Wanxing Hongkangyong entered and then exited, Hengxingyuan Fuxingyong Hengyu Zhaofengchang Yuanheng Bingxing Fuyu all exited, Yuantai Futaiheng Yuanchun Togyurui alternately entered and exited, and Daliangbang sold a total of two or three hundred bars and bought three or four hundred bars. Guangbang covered short positions of 1,600 to 1,700 bars. The total number of bars at various firms was 22,2300 as of the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Foreign Silver Softer, Then Stronger Again <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The situation ultimately feels weak.</p>
<p>The market's buying sentiment was slightly sufficient. Yesterday's market trend showed that buying sentiment was comparatively stronger, so foreign silver seemed to show a promising trend. However, observing the content, it ultimately feels incredibly weak, and there is great fear that it cannot last and will ultimately fall. As for the current state of credit, the current need for simplicity and complexity is generally moderate, so credit tightness is also quite peaceful. The news on collections and deliveries is largely even, without days of disproportionate heaviness or lightness. Subsidiary currency follows the movement of foreign silver, without any significant changes.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Fluctuations Vary (Foreign Silver) The opening silver price was two and a half dimes better than the previous day's afternoon price, at 6 yuan, 8 fen, 7 li, and 7 hao and a half.

<p>Chinese Merchants Supply Exceeds Demand</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver market was the opposite of the previous day. The British pound fell and the US dollar rose. The London market situation went from weak to firm. As for the exchange rate slightly rising, it was a reversal after three consecutive days of decline. The local exchange market trend was loose and excessive, but there was a slight hesitation in the front and back markets. It was loose in the morning and stable afterward, then tight again at noon, and particularly firm in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British pound increased by 1.875 and the US dollar rose by 3.75. However, the posted rates for the British Indian rupee and the Singapore dollar remained unchanged. The US dollar increased by 1.25, to 29 yuan and 75. The Hong Kong dollar increased by 25, to 76 taels and 75. The German mark also increased by 25, and the French franc increased by 1 yuan. The gold market suddenly showed a reverse trend and broke through 40 taels again, ultimately settling at 34 taels, which was actually influenced by the loosening trend of the exchange market. Various banks' receipts and disbursements and transactions were quite active. A total of 200,000 pounds of British gold were traded. The gold brokers largely sold off. Various banks also traded actively with each other. However, Mumbai telegraphed the sale for October. Also, a total of 7 to 800,000 yuan of US dollars were traded. Banks slightly traded against each other. Chinese gold shops' supply exceeded demand. There were occasional spread trades of bars. However, the settlement price was pressed down to 73 or 74 taels.

<p>Prices Rise by About Half a Yuan Compared to the Previous Time</p>
<p>Transactions Exceed 2.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange: only the Consolidated Tax was offered for spot trading, with transactions totaling 11,000 yuan. There were no other transactions. The futures market was also quiet, with a total of 2.56 million yuan traded between the two sessions. Among them, the Consolidated Salt Tax, Troop Reduction, 1928 Customs, etc., each accounted for around 400,000 yuan, and the rest were sparse. As for the trend of various bonds, the domestic situation seems to be still easing, and there will not be major changes in the central government. Market sentiment was slightly more stable than the previous day. Although buying sentiment still showed no signs of improvement, the selling situation was also extremely quiet. Prices showed a slight rebound compared to the previous day, with each rising by about half a yuan. The spot Consolidated Tax was the only exception, as there were no transactions yesterday and it fell by 1 yuan and 6 jiao compared to the previous day. Judging from the current environment of the bond market situation, it is still not permissible to be overly optimistic.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market trend is firm. Overseas cotton market rises sharply. Small traders cover their positions. However, due to the high prices, customer intentions are not strong. Various factories also lack spot goods. As for the Tianjin 10-count coarse yarn arriving in Shanghai, they have all been absorbed by the brokers. Large shorts in the yarn market are actively covering their positions.</p>
<p>Many Speculators Cover Short Positions, Prices Rise by Two Taels: At the opening of the foreign yarn market, US cotton was trending upward, and sentiment was good. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and more people were covering short positions. Prices rose by 2 taels and 7 or 8 qian in each month. The second and third sessions were slightly lower. As a result, the near month rose by 1 tael and 46 qian, and the far month rose by 2 taels and 2 qian. The afternoon opening situation was still good. The second and third sessions were slightly worse. Prices rose by another 3 or 4 qian in each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 59,250 bales.

<p>The US cotton government estimate was released, which was less than the public expected, only 11,306,000 bales. The market price rose by more than 80 pounds. The local cotton market sentiment was greatly boosted. Small traders painfully closed their positions. The limit was on the position, not on the price. Although a certain manufacturer was still selling in large quantities, the trend was such that it was difficult to stop. The buying power was exceptionally strong.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Jumps Two Foreign Markets: At the opening of the Zheng Biao market, it followed US cotton and rose. There was a lack of sellers in the market. Prices rose by 8 or 9 qian to 1 tael in each month. The afternoon situation was still strong. Prices rose by another 2 or 3 qian in each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 181,300 dan. The sales were: Xin Cheng 10,800 dan, Chang He 4,200 dan, Geng Feng 4,800 dan, Rong Xing 5,000 dan, Da Feng 3,600 dan, Yu Da 3,500 dan.

<p>Spot Cotton Prices Are Difficult to Approach: The spot cotton demand is still average. Because the prices on both sides are difficult to approach, the transactions are sluggish. Ling Mai Hua sold 112 pieces to the Three Friends Company for spot delivery. Ling Mai Hua sold 309 pieces to the Qing Feng Factory and delivered them to Wuxi.</p>

<p>Yesterday in South Shanghai, the source of goods in the West Road was still abundant, with about twenty or thirty dealers. Dealers' attitude was that there were slightly more arrivals, and the sales market was bound to be sluggish. The opening market in the morning was sluggish, with initial increases followed by declines. It was difficult to grasp the sentiment. Northern japonica and Zhongguan thin rice, early rice, etc., were each two or three jiao lower. New japonica and Du Yang sharp rice arrived and sold two and a half, and the price was as originally quoted.</p>
<p>There were not many arrivals at Xinzha yesterday. The transactions on this street were more sluggish than in the previous session. The opening prices of various goods had limited fluctuations. There was little appetite for Kunshan and Jiangyin rice, and the opening price fell by three jiao. Changshu and Wuxi northern japonica and early and late rice each fell by one jiao. 600 shi of new customer sharp rice arrived, and the opening price was two jiao lower. There were no transactions for the rest of the goods. The total amount of shijiao was about 1,500 shi for the day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for various months again showed a sharp rise, with foreign wheat quotations continuing to be good by about two or three jiao. It was rumored that the foreign wheat market was good due to securities and government support, and the market sentiment was expected to reach 7 jiao. Domestically, due to the continuous drought, the fields and crops have been affected. The outside world's sentiment was consistently high, and various inland brokers bought in large quantities (it was heard that the Tianjin brokers had again transacted 100,000 bags of spot goods at a price of 2 taels and 4 fen). Although factories such as Fufeng and Fuxin continued to sell smoothly, the sentiment was so high that it could not be suppressed. Therefore, although there was a temporary drop in the middle, it quickly rebounded. Observing the future trend, it should still be shifted by foreign wheat. As a result, the current month was up another 2 fen and a half from the previous day, September was 2 fen and 7 li and a half, October was 2 fen and 2 li and a half, November was 2 fen and a half, December was 2 fen and 7 li and a half, and January was 3 fen.</p>

<p>The combined price is a strong 11 yuan, and the foreign rice market is mediocre. Yesterday, the foreign rice market was very mediocre. Only the Jiangbei brokers bought more than 300 bags of small wringer in the Tongshi market. The village brokers on this street bought 800 bags, for a total of only a little over a thousand bags. There were few transactions, and it was also heard that Hunan rice would be exported to Shanghai soon. The sentiment was very soft, and the price was two or three fen lower than the previous day, with small wringer opening at 9 yuan, 6 jiao, 5 fen to 9 yuan and a half. Old small wringer opened at 9 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen. The lifting of the ban on transportation in the rice producing areas of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui has been reported in the newspapers. According to Hunan brokers yesterday, there are currently 150,000 bags of finished rice and other rice in Hunan Province, and the authorities have agreed to lift the ban and transport them to Shanghai. The first batch is scheduled to be loaded on ships before or after the 10th of this month, and will probably arrive in port after the 15th of this month. However, the market price in that area is still high, and the cost of the first batch is over 11 yuan. With the addition of passport fees and miscellaneous expenses, the cost is even higher, so it is uncertain whether it will be worthwhile to transport it to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Futures Wheat Shows Signs of Rising Again <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the market for various months again showed signs of rising sharply. With foreign wheat reporting an increase of 2 or 3 jiao, the thinking of the inland brokers, due to the relationship with spot wheat, was trending firmly. The local brokers were also quite interested in purchasing due to the scarcity of arrivals. The most significant driver of sentiment was the severe drought, with people feeling panicked. It was already autumn, but there was still no sign of rain. If the autumn harvest was hopeless, the wheat price would be high. There was a reason for the market's upward trend. As a result, the current month was up 3 fen from the previous day, September was up 4 fen, October was up 6 fen, November was up 4 fen, and December was up 5 fen. The spot wheat market situation was still quiet, and arrivals and sales were not yet active. Only 830 bags of Taicang wheat were opened throughout the day, at a price of 3 taels and 4 qian.</p>

<p>Another 200+ Bales Traded Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the sales of local white filature silk to the United States began, although the prices from New York are still low, in order to maintain the market, various manufacturers are selling at a loss, and the transactions are not weak. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson, Dachan and other companies continued to purchase, with a total of 240 bales of Grade B 13-22 strands, 76-85 point evenness, and recent white filature silk at a price of 430-550 taels, which is still for the US market. Lyon and London also telegraphed to Shanghai yesterday to inquire about the market, or they will take the opportunity to purchase futures silk in the future to meet the needs.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Yingzhuang, Jinlong, Xiehe, Tongfu, and other firms all started to purchase drawn core chun mei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas, and the transactions were not quiet. Yingfa Baitou and other firms also had a strong interest in needle mei, gong xi, pearl tea, and other varieties. Therefore, Chinese tea merchants' attitudes were firm, and the green tea market had a gradually improving trend. However, there were still no large transactions for Qining black tea.</p>

<p>Yesterday's transactions at the Public Association's Liu Pan were sluggish. The price of No. 24 Dutch coarse granulated white sugar was shouted at 14 taels and 6 qian and a half. The untaxed goods could be released soon, and the transaction price was 14 taels and 5 qian. The price was very cheap, so the buying sentiment was still active, and the market was very strong. As a result, there were fewer inquiries about spot goods. No. 14 raw sand red was 12 taels and 7 qian, and there was still a shortage of door exits. No. 9 Dutch red was 10 taels and 6 qian, and the upward trend was also strong. Bowl green slightly high goods rose to 9 taels and 4 qian. Taikoo sugar HX mark was 15 taels and 3 qian, and HM mark was 14 taels and 8 qian. Transactions were sporadic. On the plate, Yuanji opened a spot Dutch red for 500 bags at a price of 10 taels and 6 qian, and domestic Huanggang green opened several hundred packages at a price of 10 taels to 10 taels and 1 qian, and slightly lower at 9 taels and 6 qian. Because since Binghua Qing opened at 13 taels and there was a lack of door exits, the market was very strong and had a sign of rising.</p>

<p>The recent price of local factory round nails has suddenly dropped by 3 qian, with each barrel of Best (倍司) being 5 taels and 3 qian. According to the price drop, the reason for the price drop was the cheaper raw materials, and the competition among factories.

A Certain Important Person Said the Collective Resignation Was an Active Attempt to Persuade Wang, Wang Jingwei's Attitude was Firm, Entered the Hospital to Recuperate, Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei's Resignation Intentions were Unusually Determined. The previous night he moved to the hospital to rest and refused to meet any guests. Song Ziwen and He Yingqin both visited yesterday morning, but Wang was not there, and they could not meet him.

<p>Wang Jingwei's determination to resign this time was unusually firm. At 7:30 PM the previous night, after meeting with various key figures, he left his residence again to recuperate in the hospital. Yesterday, various key figures visited Wang in an endless stream, but none were able to meet him. Song Ziwen and He Yingqin visited at 9:40 AM. Chen Shaokuan went to pay his respects at 11:00 AM. Huang Shaoxiong, accompanied by Li Jishen, went in the afternoon at 3:00 PM. All were told by the gatekeeper that Mr. Wang was out and had not returned, and they left without a meeting. The location of the hospital where Wang was staying was kept a secret from Wang's residence. According to investigations, he is still staying at the Noyer Hospital on Avenue Joffre. Apparently, Wang's diabetes has not yet been completely cured, so he took the opportunity to stay in the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Song, He, Zhu, and Others Hustle to Confer <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, after Song Ziwen and He Yingqin visited Wang and failed to meet him, they went together to Zhu Peide's residence on Rue Pichon. Because Zhu had not yet arrived in Shanghai, Song returned to his residence. Soon, Zhu Jia骅 and Chen Shaokuan went together to Song's residence to discuss ways to keep Song. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Zhu Jia骅 and others returned to Song's residence to discuss and exchange opinions. The ministers strongly advocated retaining Wang, saying that as the national crisis was pressing, it was not appropriate to change the central leadership rashly.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Cabinet Ministers Submit Collective Resignation <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>This time, Wang's resignation was resolute, leaving no room for retention. Therefore, the heads of various central ministries and commissions, as the leading figures of the responsible cabinet, having firmly resigned, also submitted their collective resignations yesterday to show their solidarity. The original telegram was sent yesterday afternoon, and the transcribed content is as follows: To the Nanjing Central Political Council, to Chairman Lin in Luoyang, I have received President Wang's telegram. Ziwen and others have been ordered to serve as Vice President, Ministers, and Committee Chairmen of the Executive Yuan. Originally, we hoped to serve to the best of our ability under the leadership of President Wang during the national crisis. Now that President Wang has expressed his resignation, Ziwen and others will naturally resign together. We respectfully request approval of our resignations, with utmost anticipation. Song Ziwen, Huang Shaoxiong, Luo Wengan, He Yingqin, Chen Shaokuan, Zhu Jia骅, Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, Liu Ruiheng, Shi Qingyang, Chen Shuren, respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Process of Sending Out the Collective Resignation Telegram <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The collective resignation telegram jointly submitted by the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan and President Wang's resignation telegram came as a sudden surprise. There was almost no prior indication. It was not until the announcement that it was like a bolt from the blue, causing a stir. However, according to inquiries made by reporters to foreign sources, it was learned that the aforementioned telegrams of collective resignation by the various ministers should have been sent out the day after Wang's resignation telegram was sent. However, initially, because some ministers were not in Shanghai, according to the law, Vice President Song should lead the list. On the morning of the 7th, after the draft of the telegram was finalized, it was telegraphed to various ministers to seek their consent. After the replies from all parties were received, it was already in the evening of the 7th. The secretary transcribed the telegram and recorded the names of the various ministers before handing the transcribed draft to Song, Zhu, and others for review (Minister of Education Zhu Jia骅 was also at Song's residence at the time). While awaiting publication, Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Vice President Yang Xingfo of the Academia Sinica were also present. Upon seeing the draft telegram, Wu immediately stood up and strongly advised against sending it, saying that if the collective resignation telegram were published at this time, the situation would inevitably become more serious, and the public would inevitably feel more anxious. The Shanghai financial market might be disrupted. For the sake of stabilizing public sentiment and taking the overall situation into account, it should be postponed. Moreover, there was sincere persuasion to retain Mr. Wang, and there might be hope of reversing the situation. Why not delay it for a while, and so on. Although Song and Zhu thought it was reasonable, they felt that since the entire responsibility was involved, the ministers should resign together without hesitation. They were just about to explain to Wu when a written message from Wang arrived, inviting the ministers in Shanghai (in addition to Song and Zhu, there were also Huang Shaoxiong, Zeng Zhongming, etc.) to meet at Wang's residence on the morning of the 8th. Wu Tiecheng thus held even more firmly to the proposal to delay the telegram. Song and others also felt that there was a turning point, and it seemed that it could be delayed slightly. The telegram was thus left at Song's residence. At the meeting on the morning of the 8th, Song, Zhu, and others unanimously represented the central government in retaining Wang, and the results were quite good. Therefore, the telegram was not published again. However, yesterday, Wang re-entered the hospital to avoid noise and declined to see guests. Song and others had no choice but to send out the telegram, but it had been delayed for two days from the original intention. According to the recent central political system, the Executive Yuan is equivalent to a responsible cabinet. Therefore, when the President of the Yuan retires due to the complexity of government affairs, the heads of the various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan should naturally resign together. This is a necessary procedure in the government's organization. Therefore, after Wang sent out his resignation telegram on the 6th, Song and others, upon receiving the news, immediately drafted a telegram in preparation for a collective resignation, to show a unified step and a unified action. If there had been no consideration for the overall situation, this telegram would have been published on the 7th. Therefore, the text of the telegram is still the original text from two days ago, which is very brief. As for the various ministries and commissions after the collective resignation, they will continue to work as usual, and the ministries will continue to be responsible for their work, without any stagnation, only preparing to hand over at any time. This preparation will also be lifted when Wang returns to his post.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Mr. Song Ziwen's Statement <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen made a statement yesterday regarding the collective resignation of the heads of various ministries and commissions, saying that no one on any side knew beforehand about Mr. Wang's coming to Shanghai to resign. However, since the Executive Yuan was changed to a responsible cabinet system after the First Plenary Session, and Mr. Wang has expressed his resignation, the administration has lost its leadership. The heads of the various ministries and commissions should naturally resign together. This is the common practice of the responsible cabinet system in various countries, and it is a necessary expression of solidarity for those who bear political responsibility. There are no other reasons. As for the administrative affairs of the various ministries and commissions, during the period when the government has not appointed replacements, colleagues will naturally continue to be responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Chen Shaokuan Declares His Determination to Resign <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the collective resignation of the heads of various central ministries and commissions, a reporter specially interviewed Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan yesterday. According to Chen, the central authorities have not yet approved this resignation. If President Wang can indeed withdraw his resignation, he will still resign from his post as Navy Minister. The central authorities are still actively trying to retain President Wang. This morning, he and Minister Song, Minister Zhu, and others are still discussing ways to retain him. As for the rumors that the President of the Central Executive Yuan will be re-elected within a few days, he has not heard of them. As for the issue of Zhang Xueliang's resignation, he does not know whether the central authorities will approve it because he is in Shanghai, and it has not been discussed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Collective Resignation is an Active Effort to Retain Wang <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>A certain key government figure told reporters yesterday that everyone is making every effort to retain the resignation of Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan. It is too early to talk about the reorganization of the National Government at this time. The collective resignation of the heads of various ministries and commissions is actually a new way to actively retain Wang. Moreover, the current President of the Executive Yuan is equivalent to the Prime Minister of the cabinet in various countries, and the ministers are all cabinet members. When the Prime Minister resigns, the cabinet members naturally advance and retreat with him. The question of whether or not to approve Zhang Xueliang's resignation is also under consideration and a solution will be found soon.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Wang's Announcement in Response to Various Groups <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>In response to the letters of encouragement and reprimand from various groups in Shanghai, Wang specially issued an announcement, saying, "To the various circles of Shanghai: In recent days, I have received letters from various circles regarding Zhaoming's resignation, either earnestly urging me to stay or severely reprimanding me. I have received them all. The reasons for Zhaoming's resignation have been detailed in my telegram to Director Zhang and in my joint telegram to the Central Executive Committee. I will not repeat them one by one. I hereby reply briefly, and I hope you will understand. Wang Zhaoming, respectfully, August 9th."</p>
<h3 id="e159">Wu Zhihui Also Firmly Advocates Retaining Wang <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the East China News Agency visited Central Committee Member Wu Zhihui yesterday and asked about the resignations of Wang Jingwei and Zhang Xueliang. According to Wu, he visited Mr. Wang the day before yesterday, not to retain him, but to understand Mr. Wang's intention to resign. Currently, most parties advocate retaining Mr. Wang, but Mr. Wang's intention to resign is indeed very firm. However, his resignation is not passive, because Mr. Wang stated that if the central government could approve his resignation, he would still return to Beijing to serve. Therefore, if the central government approves Mr. Wang's resignation, it will not have an impact on the political situation. As for his successor, Mr. Wang advocates that Cai Yuanpei, Yu Youren, and Dai Jitao take over. I also think it is appropriate. As for Zhang Xueliang's resignation, because I am in Shanghai, I do not know whether the central government will approve it. However, based on my understanding, Zhang Xueliang is not foolish. Having lost the position of little emperor of the three northeastern provinces due to non-resistance, he is confined to being a little emperor of Beiping. The Japanese invaders are encroaching step by step, yet there is still no sign of resistance. This may be due to other diplomatic relations. We should now understand why the Northeast Volunteer Army is so active outside the customs, and the Japanese hate Zhang so much. Why did the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army resist the Japanese in Shanghai, and Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission did not want to add the name of resistance to himself? Why? We should use strength as a backing on the one hand, but also use diplomacy on the other. There are three major trends in the world today: red imperialism, white imperialism, and fascism. Red imperialism is, of course, the Soviet Union. White imperialism is led by the United Kingdom and the United States. Fascism originated in Italy, and Japan has now succeeded, and Germany is also booming. The three major trends in the world cannot cooperate at all. Japan's fascism has succeeded by swallowing up the eastern provinces, but white imperialists are very unwilling to see Japan swallowing up the eastern provinces. They do not want fascism to be the leader of East Asia. Therefore, they express great anger at Japan's annexation of the eastern provinces in terms of international morality. But their diplomatic skills are very cautious and they do not act rashly. They want to slowly make Japan gradually vomit out the eastern provinces it has already swallowed, but at the same time they are unwilling to immediately help China, so that China can shake off its shackles and retaliate by abolishing unequal treaties. Therefore, they hesitate and are still not fully and clearly expressed. Therefore, many Chinese people would rather be followers of redism. China is in the midst of these three major trends, and the authorities must be very cautious in their diplomacy. Zhang Xueliang may not be able to fully express himself due to diplomatic relations, and his childlike temper is especially prone to offending people.</p>

<p>Mi Chunlin, Zhang Xueliang's representative, has visited Mayor Wu and Finance Minister Song since arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, personally delivering Zhang Xueliang's letters. According to him, the purpose of his visit to Shanghai was to meet with Mr. Wang to explain everything, but there has been no opportunity to meet with Mr. Wang. Zhang Xueliang also has a personal letter to Mr. Wang explaining the situation in North China. After visiting Wang, I will earnestly ask Mr. Wang to withdraw his resignation. His stay in Shanghai is expected to be about a week.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Yesterday's Reception for the Press <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Report on the Current Situation of Negotiations between Kang and Tibet. Ma Ze Zhao, representative of the people of Xikang and director of the resident Beijing office, specially came to Shanghai from Beijing on the 7th to make the people of the whole country understand the situation in Kang and Tibet, unite to eliminate foreign troubles, and consolidate national defense. Yesterday, at the Eastern Hotel on Tibet Road, he hosted the local press to report everything. Dozens of reporters from various newspapers attended. Ma's report is recorded below:</p>
<p>Mr. Ma said, "Today, I am very honored that the Shanghai press, which bears the important mission of arousing public opinion and urging the government, has come here. What I am prepared to report to you is the Kang-Tibet incident, which has not been paid attention to by the people in the country and is now extremely serious, that is, the national defense incident in southwestern China. In the 19th year of the Republic, I was elected by all the people of Tibet to serve as a people's representative in Beijing. Recently, I have been aware of the seriousness of the situation in Kang and Tibet, the urgency of national defense, and the lack of understanding of the Kang affairs among the people in the country. In order to make the people of the whole country understand the situation in Kang and Tibet, unite to eliminate foreign troubles, develop resources, and consolidate national defense, I have specially come here from Nanjing to give you a brief report, in order to obtain powerful assistance and instruction. It is divided into four points: (1) The status of Xikang, externally connected with Tibet under the Dalai Lama's yellow lion flag, internally connected with the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai. In the third year of the Republic, the northern government unified the administrative regions and designated Kangding as the first capital. The eastern part of Kangding was settled, and the rest of the southern road was thirteen counties such as Yajiang, Lihua, and Ba'an. The northern road was seven counties such as Daofu and Ganmei. The middle road was four counties such as Zhanhua and Baiyu. Including Jiulong, Danba, and other places, there are a total of thirty-two counties. During the Xinhai Revolution, the Tibetan army took advantage of the rise of our revolutionary army to invade and occupy Sang'ang and Chayu, west of the Lancang River. In the seventh year of the Republic, they also occupied ten counties such as Qamdo and Ningjing. In the 19th year of the Republic, on the pretext of a minor dispute between the Da and Bai temples, they occupied Ganzi, Zhanhua, and Qiongxia of Lihua. The Zhubo and other places in Huo, and unfortunately, the Kang-Tibetan dispute was formed. In total, the Tibetan army occupied about three-quarters of the Kang area. The violence has lasted for more than twenty years, and all miscellaneous grains, butter, tea, salt, horse grass, etc. have been requisitioned from the Kang people. If they do not obey, they will suffer the tragic punishment of amputation and cutting off the nose. The people of Bieli Village could not bear the abuse and migrated to avoid it, wandering and unable to return home. It is painful to say that because it is far away from the center, although the territory has been invaded and the people are in dire straits, the government and the people of the country are still indifferent. The Dalai Lama has another background and is manipulated by others, and has no sincerity towards the central government. This can be seen from the historical facts. In the dispute between the Da and Bai temples two years ago, it was a minor incident. The Tibetan side sided with Dajie Temple, used it as an excuse to attack our Kang defense army, and at the same time sent a message to the central government, asking to send personnel for peaceful mediation. At the same time, they sent troops to occupy Ganzi and Zhanhua. After the central special envoy Tang Kesan arrived in Kang, he saw that they had other conspiracies and could not mediate. Peace was hopeless, so he had to leave Kang and return to Beijing. The Kang affairs became deadlocked. In April of this year, the Tibetan army suddenly advanced in three routes to attack our army. Our army was forced to counterattack and advanced to recover Ganzi. On the 7th day of July, the enemy counterattacked again and was repelled by our army, and Dajie Temple was captured again, and advanced to Rongba, Chayu, and other places. Recently, Kang received a telegram that the Dalai Lama was angry at the defeat on the front line. On the one hand, he transported a large number of new weapons purchased from abroad to the front line to replenish them. On the other hand, he mobilized the entire Tibetan army to launch a full-scale counterattack, and the Dalai Lama personally went to Qamdo to command, attempting to recapture Ganzhan in one fell swoop and occupy the entire Kang. This is the Dalai Lama's unrighteous infringement of national defense. (2) Since the Tibetan side started the war again, this office has repeatedly received Kang telegrams, saying that the Tibetan army has airplanes, cannons, and other items in this battle, and all kinds of new weapons should be available. The people of Kang have repeatedly telegraphed and requested the central government to provide assistance with national strength. After this office repeatedly submitted and requested the central government to quickly determine a major plan to strengthen national defense, it was heard that the central government is still under planning. As for the allocation of ammunition, the Ministry of Military Affairs promised to temporarily allocate some bullets to provide assistance. At present, the war situation in the front line is not only urgent in the northern road, but the Tibetan army is also disturbing Ba'an, and the southern road is also tense at the same time. Recently, the Kang border defense army Commander Yu sent a letter, saying that the north and south roads are requesting reinforcements and ammunition, and the urgent requests are constant. It is extremely difficult for the isolated army to cope with it on both sides. It seems that the war zone has expanded and the consumption has increased, which is impossible without the central government's full assistance. The climate in Kang is cold in autumn. Now that summer is over, winter will arrive in a blink of an eye. The military needs extremely urgent supplies such as leather shoes and leather vests to keep out the cold. This office is now actively requesting the government, on the one hand, to implement the policy of recovering Xikang, continue to use force to drive out the Tibetan bandits, and on the other hand, to provide full assistance with ammunition and expenses, so as to avoid the isolated army fighting hard and being difficult to support. (3) Xikang is not the Xikang of the people of Xikang, nor is it the Xikang of Liu Zongzhihui Wenhui. In other words, it is not the provincial defense of a certain province, but the national defense of the entire Republic of China. How to plan and handle it as a whole should be decided by the central government and handed over to the border defense officers in charge. It cannot be blamed on a certain person to resist with the strength of a corner of the country. This battle is purely for saving the people of Kang and consolidating national defense, which is different from internal wars. The Dalai Lama's military action is for tigers to be slaves, for people to be puppets. Those who suffer are directly the insignificant Kang people, and indirectly the manifestation of imperialism attacking our entire nation. With the loss of the Northeast, the balance of power of the imperialists in the Far East has already been lost. If the people of the country do not take precautions against the Kang and Tibet coveted by a certain country, I dare to say that in the near future, it will be the second Northeast. For the sake of prevention, now we should take advantage of this victory and the high morale, and the central government should immediately order Chairman Liu to continue to advance victoriously and recover all lost lands. On the one hand, we should fully provide assistance with ammunition and expenses, and hold them responsible for success, recover Xikang, engage in construction, and then plan to reform Tibet. Otherwise, even if we win by luck, the Tibetan army will inevitably take the opportunity to occupy Xikang again. This office's work is now focused on this, and I hope that our enlightened press will give us assistance, then Xikang will be fortunate, and national defense will be fortunate. (4) Xikang's production, such as mines, forests, animal husbandry, and medicinal materials, are extremely abundant, but they have not been developed. It is like a treasure house, which is still locked and has not been opened. If a large amount of capital can be invested to develop it, the good results will be like a sure thing. Shanghai is the center of capital concentration in our country. I hope that you will actively promote and urge the attention of all walks of life to invest and develop, which will be greatly beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. On behalf of the people of Kang, I extend my sincere hope to you, and I offer a glass and wish you all good health.</p>
<p>The Kang-Tibetan War, the Kang-Tibetan War, has recently become more intense again. Mr. Shi received a telegram from Yu Songlin, the commander-in-chief of Xikang, reporting on the recent war situation. The original telegram is recorded below: "To Mr. Ma Zezhao, Director of the Xikang Resident Beijing Office: After our army captured Dajin Yulong, the Tibetan side took advantage of the fact that we were focusing on local settlement and had no time to advance to counterattack with reinforcements. Since the 25th, our army has fought on three routes, which has been very fierce. Finally, on the 27th, we occupied Keludong, and on the 28th, we recovered Dege County. On the 29th, we went straight to Gangtuo River ferry on the Jinsha River. The Tibetan army mostly crossed the river westward. The Tibetan troops in Dengke, Shiqu, Baiyu, and other counties heard that Dege had been captured by our army and were preparing to retreat to the west bank of the Jinsha River. We are sending troops to recover them. On the 25th, we sent the Ma regiment from Lihua to Ba'an to take over the defense. The areas lost in the seventh year of the Republic can be fully recovered within days. However, in each battle, the wounded officers and soldiers have consumed a lot of bullets. The headquarters has stopped various miscellaneous expenses for the border war, so it is difficult to prepare military supplies and transport food. If this continues, it is really impossible for one army to shoulder this important task of national defense. What will happen in the future? My brother has foresight and vision. I hope you will give me instructions. Yours sincerely, Winter."</p>
<p>[Japanese Troops Stationed in Shanghai</p>
<h3 id="e163">Armed Demonstration in Jiangwan Yesterday Morning <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Practiced at the sports field and then withdrew</p>
<p>The municipal government will lodge a protest with the Japanese side. Recently, the Japanese have been very active in Shanghai. Several days ago, they sent many Japanese spies in plain clothes to scout in the Zhabei area. Yesterday morning, dozens of Japanese soldiers, traveling in more than ten armored vehicles, went to Jiangwan to carry out an armed demonstration. They were stopped by the Public Security Bureau, who sent police, and then withdrew. Afterwards, the Public Security Bureau reported to the municipal government that it planned to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese side. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Heading to Jiangwan, around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters stationed in Shanghai suddenly sent out a small team of troops, about forty or fifty people, traveling in fourteen armored vehicles. The vehicles were equipped with various field guns and machine guns. When the Japanese troops passed through the Jiangwan Road area, the nearby residents thought that a great disaster was coming. They were terrified and fled home to hide. Those who could not escape hid in the fields. The Japanese troops went to the Jiangwan Sports Association grounds after passing through Jiangwan Road and turning onto Xiangyin Road. This was the place where the Japanese army was stationed during the war.</p>
<p>Demonstration and Retreat When the Japanese troops arrived at the sports association grounds, the captain of the squad ordered them to stop. At that time, a command flag was waved, and a full armed exercise was held, and armored vehicles were driven around. When the police station of the Fifth District Branch of the Public Security Bureau saw this, they quickly reported to the police station. The director of the district, Dai Hongen, led the police to negotiate. The Japanese troops then withdrew, and the demonstration-style exercise lasted for half an hour.</p>
<p>The municipal government said that the reporter from the New Voice News Agency went to the municipal government yesterday to inquire about this matter. According to them, the municipal government has received a report about this matter, but the details are not known. It has ordered the local police authorities to report the details. Since the signing of the armistice agreement, the Japanese troops have been gradually withdrawing and cannot enter our country at will. This action is illegal and hinders our country's security. Therefore, it will be based on the facts and will lodge a serious protest with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Pretending to pay respects, according to the Japanese side, it was because many Japanese soldiers were killed in the Shanghai war, and many died in that place. Therefore, they specially went there to pay respects. However, this reason is not sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Continued Increase of Over Two Thousand Troops Daily <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>It is reported by the Shiwenshe that the existing garrison had already reached over three thousand two hundred men. According to reliable sources, the Commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai, Sakonji, and the Commander of the Marine Corps, Sugisaka, have repeatedly telegraphed the Naval Ministry, requesting additional naval personnel to be sent to Shanghai. In the past week alone, over two thousand three hundred Japanese naval personnel have been dispatched to Shanghai. The various pieces of information obtained by the Shiwenshe reporter are recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese troops are continuously increasing in Shanghai. After the formal signing of the armistice agreement, the Japanese regular army and naval landing forces stationed in Shanghai were ordered to withdraw to their home country in batches. The majority of them were immediately transferred to Guanwai (Northeast China) to join the Japanese army in fighting against the volunteer forces. Up until around the 20th of last month, the Japanese Navy in Shanghai consisted of only over eight hundred and forty special marine corps members, eight hundred stationed at the Japanese Naval Headquarters on Jiangwan Road, and over forty stationed at the Toyota Textile Mill in western Shanghai. Since the Northeast Customs was seized and the Chinese government decided to levy tariffs on goods transported to the Northeast, Japanese merchants in Shanghai have been requesting the Commander of the Third Fleet of the Navy, Sakonji, to protect cargo transportation by force. Recently, the activities of the Blood Soul Assassination Corps have dealt a major blow to Japanese trade with China. Commander Sakonji and Commander of the Marine Corps Sugisaka, deeply concerned that the military strength in Shanghai was insufficient to meet the needs of overseas merchants, repeatedly telegraphed the Japanese Naval Ministry, requesting additional naval personnel to be sent to Shanghai to assist in managing affairs. As of yesterday (the 8th), in addition to the original eight hundred men stationed at the Japanese Naval Headquarters on Jiangwan Road, four new battalions of marines, approximately two thousand eight hundred and eighty men, newly dispatched from the home country, have been stationed. At the same time, three platoons of Japanese soldiers, totaling approximately two hundred and forty men, have been stationed at the Dobun Shoin Academy and Toyota Textile Mill in western Shanghai. In total, over the past week, over two thousand three hundred Japanese naval personnel have been dispatched from the home country to Shanghai. Combined with the original troops in Shanghai, the actual number is confirmed to be over three thousand one hundred men. According to the Japanese Navy's organization in Shanghai, three companies form a battalion, three platoons form a company, and each platoon has eighty men. Currently, the Japanese troops in Shanghai consist of a total of four battalions and three platoons.</p>
<p>Sugisaka Strictly Establishes Training Regulations. Sugisaka, Commander of the Japanese Naval Marine Corps, considering the increasing number of naval personnel stationed in Shanghai, has strictly re-established the previously established training rules for the sake of unified training. It is stipulated that if the temperature exceeds ninety degrees, afternoon training will be suspended, but in the morning, soldiers must still rise at five o'clock, practice street fighting tactics for two hours, and academic subjects for one hour. If the temperature does not exceed ninety degrees, all must attend two training sessions in the afternoon. It is also stipulated that a platoon inspection will be held once a week, and a general review will be held every three weeks. These new training regulations were communicated yesterday to all subordinate officers and soldiers for compliance.</p>
<p>A Portion of Japanese Troops Will Return Home. According to news from the Japanese Naval Headquarters on Jiangwan Road, a portion of the Marine Corps, over three hundred and fifty men, will be returning home on the Tenryu Maru on the 9th. The date of departure has not yet been determined. However, according to another source, the three hundred and fifty men being transferred home will be sent to Guanwai to assist in the attack on Jehol.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Departed Yesterday to Inspect Japanese Warships on the Yangtze River <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagongshe, Japanese Third Fleet Naval Commander Sakonji, in order to inspect the defenses of the Japanese naval fleet along the Yangtze River, departed yesterday morning at four o'clock, leading over a hundred naval officers and special service soldiers of the fleet on the flagship Izumo to Hankou. At the time of departure, the destroyers "Yu" and "Yanagi" also departed, fully loaded with military supplies and慰問品comfort goods. Marine Corps Commander Sugisaka, Consul General Murai, Secretary Okazaki, and important Japanese figures such as Areno, Tanaka, and Horiuchi all went to the pier to see them off. It is heard that Sakonji's departure will first take him to Hankou to inspect important passes in Jiujiang and Yichang, and then he will inspect and give instructions to the Japanese warships stationed along the Yangtze River, and offer慰勞sympathy. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in one month.</p>

<p>His Departure Was Very Hasty. According to the Dagongshe, Japanese Embassy military attaché Colonel Tanaka, since arriving in Shanghai earlier this month, has been discussing the Northeast Manchuria issue with Japanese military and political leaders and exchanging views, actively engaging in activities. It is now learned that Colonel Tanaka suddenly received a telegram from the Northeast the day before yesterday, due to the serious situation of the Jehol Incident, urging him to return to Dalian immediately to discuss how to deal with the situation. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Tanaka immediately packed his luggage and left Shanghai yesterday morning on the Dalian Maru to go to the Northeast. It is heard that his departure was quite hasty.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Japanese Newspaper Falsely Accuses Chinese Police of Desertion <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Will Lodge a Protest. According to the Shiwenshe, in recent days, residents in the Zhabei area have been unsettled and rumors have been rife due to the occasional discovery of Japanese plainclothes detectives in places such as the North Station. A certain Japanese newspaper in Shanghai even published a report falsely accusing our police stationed at the Baziqiao in Zhabei of suddenly deserting with over fifty men, stating that "Recently, the police of the Chinese Public Security Bureau stationed in the Baziqiao area of Zhabei, fearing the recurrence of the January 28th Incident, suddenly agreed to desert a few days ago, with as many as over fifty men." After reading this report, Mayor Wu Tiecheng immediately ordered Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Yingxing to thoroughly investigate the matter so as to lodge a protest with the Japanese side. After receiving the order, Chief Wen immediately dispatched personnel to the Baziqiao area to conduct a thorough investigation, confirming that the report in the Japanese newspaper about the desertion of Chinese police was completely untrue and was clearly intended to insult our police administration and slander the character of our police. After reporting the situation to the municipal government, it is now learned that Mayor Wu Tiecheng formally lodged a serious protest with Japanese Consul Murai at 10:00 AM today, demanding that the newspaper make a solemn correction to the above news and guarantee that Japanese newspapers will not publish similar slanderous news in the future. The full text of the protest letter was drafted last night and formally written after Mayor Wu's review.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Qingdao Inspection Team <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<h3 id="e173">Wang Yansong, Pan Gongzhan, and Others Return to Shanghai <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Wang Talks About the Excellent Results of Opium Suppression in Jinan. The Qingdao inspection team organized by the business community of Shanghai left Qingdao in two groups after completing their inspection. One group, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and Chen Zheqing, returned to Shanghai by sea via Weihaiwei. The other group, including Wang Yansong, Pan Gongzhan, Zhao Jinqing, Huang Ruisheng, and Wang Zijian, went to Jinan via the Jiaoji Railway, stayed in Jinan for one day, and then took the Jinpu Railway to Beijing. Yesterday morning, they returned to Shanghai from Beijing. A reporter from the Xinshengshe went to visit Mr. Wang Yansong to ask about his impressions after the inspection. According to him, his impression of Qingdao was very good, and various construction projects were gradually developing, with very promising prospects. He especially felt that the ancient saying "when the person is present, the government thrives" was not false. Since Han Fuqu took office in Jinan, opium, morphine, white medicine, and other drugs have been strictly prohibited. Because most of the traffickers of these drugs are Japanese vagrants, Han sends out secret investigators at any time to closely monitor near the shops selling drugs. If anyone buys them, they will be confiscated and severely punished, so the opium ban is almost completely cleared. This is indeed commendable. In addition, municipal construction is also being actively carried out, such as using the city walls to build roads for cars, which is also an innovation in various provinces and cities.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Thorough Investigation of Japanese Rice Sales <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Will Send Personnel for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Please Form a Special Review Committee</p>
<p>A Letter to Yukang Warehouse to Stop Moving Rice. Since the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received the report from the traitorous merchant investigation team exposing Shu Zhanyuan's exclusive sales of Japanese rice, it has been conducting a rigorous investigation. The Business Section dispatched personnel to the Soy and Rice Merchants Association to send personnel to jointly conduct a thorough investigation to find out the truth. At the same time, it also sent a letter to Yukang Warehouse along the Suzhou River in Xinlaji Bridge, prohibiting the movement of Japanese rice. The original letter stated: "Respected Sir/Madam, according to reports, your warehouse has more than 100,000 bags of Japanese rice. It is urgently necessary to send personnel to thoroughly investigate which company the rice belongs to. We are sending this letter to notify you to temporarily stop moving the rice so that a thorough investigation can be conducted. We look forward to your cooperation."</p>
<p>Rice Dealers Association Clarifies the Process. The Rice Dealers Association, seeing the report in the newspaper of the letter from the traitorous merchant investigation team to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, expressed deep dissatisfaction with the association's investigation of Shu Zhanyuan's shipping of Japanese rice. The association immediately sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday based on the information in the report, stating: "Respected Sir/Madam, we have read in today's newspapers a letter from the traitorous merchant investigation team to your association, accusing Shu Zhanyuan of being a traitorous merchant selling Japanese rice and suspecting that our association's investigation was perfunctory and published a certificate to cover up for him. It also pointed out that there were more than 100,000 bags of rice with the red mark "DS" stored in Yukang Warehouse in Zhabei. Our association is deeply dissatisfied. Regarding this matter, because of the publication in the "Formosa News," our association recommended two standing committee members, Shi and Zhang, to investigate various rice dealers, including Rentai Company, Kaitai, Santai, and Jitai Shan, and Rentai Rice Store, based on the report. Because the report said that Shu was selling Mitsui Japanese rice, the various account books and rice stored in the stores at the time were reviewed and checked, and there was no trace of exclusive sales of Japanese rice. After extensively consulting with people in the same industry, there was no evidence to be presented. Therefore, a report was made to the association. For the sake of caution, an emergency meeting of all executive committee members was immediately convened on the 5th of this month. Shu Zhanyuan was also present, and he voluntarily requested a thorough investigation and said that if it could be pointed out that he had been selling Japanese rice, he was willing to accept extremely severe sanctions. The committee members all believed that Mr. Shu did not have this suspicion. Colleagues knew that in order to dispel the doubts of the public and to clarify Mr. Shu's position, it was resolved by the association to publish the results of the investigation to prove that Shu Zhanyuan was not selling Japanese rice. This is the process of our association handling this matter. Our association handled this matter with utmost fairness and asked ourselves that we had no bias. However, the traitorous merchant investigation team sent another letter to your association, with much criticism of our association. This matter concerns the patriotic movement and is compelled by public justice. Although there is no other intention, the facts of right and wrong must be distinguished. If Shu Zhanyuan has this behavior, there must be facts to prove it. Since the team claims that there are still more than 100,000 bags of enemy rice in the warehouse and that there are trademarks that can be presented, it is not difficult to follow the clues and immediately go to the warehouse to seal the rice, and the truth will come out. The team also believes that the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association handled the matter properly, so it should request your association to immediately join the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association to investigate and deal with it quickly. What is true and what is false must be a matter of public opinion. Our association should avoid suspicion and wait for your association to organize a special review committee to thoroughly investigate and clarify the situation. This letter is sent to request your association to promptly handle the matter."</p>
<h3 id="e175">Anti-Enemy Goods Movement Yesterday <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Warns the Southern Goods Industry. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Southern Goods Industry Association, stating: "Respected Sir/Madam, according to reports, the Southern Goods Workers Union has reported that members of the Southern Goods Industry Association are importing large quantities of Japanese goods, such as Japanese sugar and seafood, and that the Xin Yongyuan Company established by the chairman of the association is also among them. This is shocking. Permanent economic severance with Japan was resolved by the temporary general meeting of members last year. Since the various associations are members of our association, they have an obligation to faithfully fulfill the resolution. The chairman, as a role model for the association, has an even greater responsibility, but he also follows the trend and only seeks personal gain. How can he convince the public? Our association believes that the circumstances of this matter are serious and that a thorough investigation is necessary. We first issue a serious warning, hoping that you will deeply repent, quickly stop importing Japanese goods, and clearly respond, otherwise, the association's rules are in place, and our association will not ignore it in order to enforce discipline."</p>
<p>The Timber Industry Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Timber Industry Association received warning letters one after another and held an emergency executive committee meeting at the association's office on Fuyou Road in the Nanshi District at 3:00 PM yesterday. The following 14 people were present: Wei Shanfu (Zhenshengyu), Shen Jinhuai (Yuanshun), Wang Shenglin (Yinji), Pan Leifan (Taimao), Cao Zaixun (Ruida), Cai Hezhang (Huida), Xu Yiming (Xiexing), Zhang Xiaoliang (Xinzazuo substitute) (Jiuji), Ma Boshen (Zhenchang), Huang Xingsheng (Yuanxing), Ni Zhitao (Xiesheng), Zhuang Shenju (Qiada), and Qi Jinchuan (Yuanmaosheng). Chairman Wei Shanfu presided over the meeting. The chairman reported that the association had received letters from the Iron Blood Assassination Corps and the Ten-Man National Salvation Corps, warning colleagues against selling enemy goods. However, since the association organized an inspection team after the September 18th Incident and sealed all remaining Japanese goods of colleagues, if there are any colleagues who have not joined the association who have the above situation, the association has difficulty keeping an eye on them at all times and cannot guarantee that no unscrupulous elements are operating in secret. He asked the public to discuss solutions. After careful deliberation, the following resolutions were made: (1) Send a circular to warn all colleagues and issue a statement in the newspaper permanently boycotting Japanese goods. If any disputes occur to members who have joined the association, the association will not be responsible. (2) The association will continue to receive the Iron Blood Corps' warning letter to the Yuanshun Company, a colleague in Hongkou, for selling Japanese goods. The resolution was to prepare a letter from the association and attach the original warning letter to forward to the colleague for their attention and reply. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>The Drivers' Association Sent a Letter to the Shipping Association. According to the Dagongshe, the Chinese Seamen's Drivers' Association sent a letter to the Shipping Association yesterday, stating: "Respected Sir/Madam, since the Northeast Incident, the Chinese people have been forced to a state of daily peril. Therefore, the entire country has automatically boycotted goods, regardless of whether its power is weak or seemingly incapable of killing the enemy, but at the very least, it can cause a considerable blow to the other party. As Chinese people, how can we inspire conscience, give up private interests, and vow to uphold this vow? However, it has recently been heard that some unfilial Chinese merchants are colluding with enemies, first delivering inferior coal at a price of six yuan and five jiao per ton of Japanese money, and then paying for it after it is sold, to supply Chinese ships for burning. A certain northern Chinese company has stockpiled the most, reaching as much as 40,000 tons. The rumors are spreading like wildfire. An investigation has revealed that domestic coal for ships in Yingkou, Tanggu, Andong, Dalian, and other places has long disappeared from the market, and that the ships of a certain company that have left here do not load domestic coal in this port, and have historically used inferior coal. These are verifiable facts, which shows that the rumors are not unfounded. Our association, in addition to finding ways to investigate these traitorous merchants, the details of the inside story, and publish them at any time to request social sanctions, also asks your association to inform members that all ships traveling to the Northeast in the future must load domestic coal and must not continue to use enemy goods, disregarding the great injustice and being abandoned by the Chinese people. This is important. Correspondingly, we send this letter to request your attention and action."</p>

<h3 id="e182">Ship Sinks Rowboat <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Rowboat Capsizes, Over Ten People Fall into River</p>
<p>One Female Worker Rescued, Two Bodies Recovered</p>
<p>The Hakone Maru, a European liner of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the previous day and docked at the Wayside Wharf. Yesterday morning around 5:00 AM, it departed Shanghai for Japan. While turning around to exit, its propellers sank a sampan, resulting in fatalities. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Hakone Maru, having arrived in Shanghai from Europe, docked at the Hongkou Wayside Wharf to load and unload cargo. It began to weigh anchor for Japan at 5:45 AM yesterday morning. Tugs were used to tow and maneuver the ship, including a turn. At that time, the tide was rising rapidly. According to usual practice, when turning with the rising tide, the stern of the ship had to be towed towards Pudong before the bow could be steered outwards. As the tugboats were towing the stern towards Pudong, a sampan, fully loaded with female workers on their way from Qichang Wharf to work in Puxi, was passing by the stern of the Hakone Maru. Seeing the ship stationary, the sampan attempted to pass quickly. Unexpectedly, the propellers suddenly started, creating a surge of waves that immediately sank the small sampan, causing all ten-plus people on board to completely submerge.</p>
<p>When the sampan was hit and sank, cries for help were incessant, but due to the large size of the ship, the immense power of its engines, and the waves several feet high, nearby boats did not dare to approach and rescue the drowning victims, and were only able to watch it sink. After the ship moved far away, it was too late to salvage anything. Only one girl was rescued, named Qu Fuying, about twelve years old. When the sampan overturned, she was swept by a wave under the Qichang Wharf. The girl grabbed onto a concrete pillar of the wharf and was then pulled ashore by an elderly man. The girl went home by herself. Later, the Wayside Road Water Police Station investigated and found that after the girl returned home, she became ill due to shock and swallowing several mouthfuls of water, but was not in great danger.</p>
<p>After receiving a report, the Wayside Road Water Police Station dispatched detectives to investigate the scene. They saw the Hakone Maru proceeding as usual. The police took the sampan and its boatmen, Du Jutian and Du Xiaodingzi, both from Jiangbei, back to the police station. At Qichang Wharf, a woman named Wu Yangshi, wife of Wu Zhaohan, was crying, and she was also taken back to the police station. According to Wu Yangshi, she, her daughter Wu Pindi, 13, and her niece Yang Jincui, 16, all worked at the Shenxin No. 7 Factory, and were traveling together to work in Puxi. She herself wanted to go to Shanghai, so she took a city ferry, a small steamer. On the small steamer, she saw the sampan her two daughters were riding in suddenly sink, and knew that her two daughters had drowned. She said that she had given birth to nine children, but eight had already died young, leaving only this one daughter, hoping she could find a son-in-law to rely on in old age. As she spoke, she wept bitterly and was inconsolable. The police chief comforted her and sent her home, telling her that they would notify her when the bodies were recovered so she could identify them.</p>
<p>After bringing the boatmen Du Jutian and Du Xiaodingzi back to the police station, the police chief conducted a preliminary interrogation. They confessed to carrying ten people in total and recounted the details of the incident. The sampan boatmen were temporarily detained at the Water Police Station and were to be sent to the local court for disposition tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning). According to Qu Fuying, who escaped danger, there were about twelve people on the boat at the time. Apart from the report from Wu Pindi's mother, the police station had received no reports from other families, so they assumed that some families were unaware of the situation. Since the bodies had not yet been recovered, the number of victims was not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>After the incident, in addition to the Water Police attempting a salvage operation, a compradore from Qichang Wharf, a Cantonese man, hired small fishing boats to retrieve the bodies, offering three dollars for each one. Around 10:00 AM, a fishing boat belonging to Zhu Da Wangzi recovered a female body, about ten years old, from the nearby Huangpu River. Relatives were present and immediately claimed the body for burial without notifying the police station. Later, at 11:30 AM, another female body, about fifteen years old, named Ni Lindi, was retrieved near the wharf. A patrolman noticed and ordered the fishing boat to send the body to the Water Police Station, which then transported it to the Nanshi Salvation Bureau for temporary storage, awaiting forensic examination by the court tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning).</p>
<p>After the incident, the Hakone Maru believed it was not involved and, due to its scheduled departure, did not offer assistance, departing as scheduled. The ship's officer sent a radio message to the Japanese Mail Steamship Company in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Paramour Gruesomely Murders Mistress <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Triggered by Woman's Infidelity</p>
<p>Murderer Caught on Scene by Police at 825, Rear Building, Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop, Corner of Seward Road and Dent Road. Murder Case Occurred Yesterday Afternoon; Murderer Caught on Scene. Details as Follows:</p>
<p>"One Cut Severed" Becomes Ominous Prophecy: Murderer Pu Henian, 23, from Qingpu, male; victim Wang Xiuying, 25, from Suzhou, female. They rented a room on the upper floor of the Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop last month on the 19th, agreeing on a monthly rent of six yuan. Pu claimed his surname was Chen and that they were husband and wife, with him being a primary school teacher. The sublessor saw that their behavior was civilized, so they did not investigate their background. Moreover, the two were very close on weekdays, so no suspicion arose. The previous night (the 8th), Xiuying went out and did not return until yesterday morning. When Henian returned home for lunch yesterday afternoon, he immediately questioned her about where she had stayed the previous night. Xiuying replied that she had stayed in a rented room. As a result, the two started arguing. Finally, Xiuying said that since they were not compatible, they might as well "sever with one cut" and ordered Henian to write a separation agreement. At that moment, Pu became uncontrollably angry and declared, "Since you want to 'sever with one cut,' there's a way to do it." He immediately grabbed a kitchen knife from the table and violently slashed Xiuying's face.</p>
<p>Alert Sublessor Raises Alarm: Xiuying was only wearing a short vest and shorts, lying on the bed. After being slashed in the face, she jumped up from the bed and screamed for help. Liu Cao Shi, the sublessor downstairs, was having lunch. Hearing the cries for help, she stopped eating and went upstairs, knocking urgently on the door. Pu did not respond. She crouched down and peeked through the crack in the door, and saw Xiuying rolling around on the floor, screaming in pain, with bloodstains all over the floor. Mrs. Liu realized something had happened and quickly turned around to go downstairs, instructing her apprentice to call the police. Returning upstairs, she saw that Xiuying had died, and Pu Henian was halfway down the stairs, trying to escape. Liu Cao Shi grabbed him. Fortunately, patrolman No. 2023 from a nearby post also arrived after being notified and apprehended the murderer, sending him to the Wayside Police Station. The police station dispatched officers to investigate the scene, and the body was transported by vehicle to the Ferron Road morgue to await examination.</p>
<p>Paramour Refuses Additional Lovers: The murderer Pu Henian confessed at the police station that he made a living selling pills for rejuvenation. The victim Wang Xiuying was his mistress. They met on a Suzhou steamer on March 25 of this year. They first lived in the French Concession. Later, because Pu's legal wife came to Shanghai, they moved to this location. Recently, Xiuying had not been keeping to her duties, frequently staying out. He had found out that she had a relationship with a certain teaboy at the Central Hotel. Her staying out the previous night was because she and the teaboy had been together at a Suzhou hotel. When he questioned her slightly, Xiuying forced him to write a separation agreement, which is why he did it out of anger.</p>
<p>Seven Cuts Sever Left Hand: Wang Xiuying was slashed a total of seven times by Pu Henian. Five cuts were to the head, including two on the throat and three on the eyes, nose, and face. There was one cut on the right shoulder and back. The left hand was cut off and fell to the ground. As a result, blood flowed all over the place. The downstairs area, as well as the bedclothes and other items in the room, were covered with bloodstains. The corpse lay in a pool of blood, a truly gruesome sight that was unbearable to witness.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Lake Region Kidnapping Gang <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Ten Male and Female Kidnappers Apprehended</p>
<p>Seven Kidnapped Children Rescued</p>
<p>Exotic Prostitute's Madame Also an Accomplice</p>
<p>Chen Yueying's Experienced Ordeal: Recently, the Zhabei Police Station received a secret report stating that a large group of kidnappers was hiding at No. 7 Qunshou Lane, 161 Baker Road, specializing in trafficking women. On the morning of the day before yesterday at 9:25 AM, police chief Nai Pai, along with Chinese detectives Tang Jian, Ding Huaguo, Yang Fusheng, Bao Tan Zhang Yutian, and Western detective Bao Tai, went to investigate. They discovered that the residents of the house were mostly from the Lake Region and used deception to lure girls from their hometowns to Shanghai for sale, profiting from the transactions. The police then began the arrests, apprehending ten male and female kidnappers, including Zhou Cuilan (also known as Lansheng), Tao Guifu, Shen Runliu, Fei Futang, Bi Chengdeng, Tao Guisheng, Zhou Zixiang, and the women Fei Bi Shi, Shen Su Shi, and Tao Yuan Shi, along with sixteen-year-old Fei Xianglin, fifteen-year-old Zhang Baozhu, thirteen-year-old Shi Zhubao, fifteen-year-old Zhou Lanzhen, seventeen-year-old Tao Mao, sixteen-year-old Chen Yueying, and five-year-old boy Zhou Amao, all from the Lake Region. Afterwards, they went to the Yanfei Brothel at No. 323 Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road, and apprehended an accomplice, the Suzhou brothel owner Pan Lao Si, and brought them to the police station. The police chief ordered the eleven male and female defendants to be detained separately. The remaining boys and girls were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The defendants hired three lawyers, Yuan Yang'an, etc., to defend them. According to police lawyer Wang Yaotang, the defendants were prosecuted for the crime of disrupting families under Article 257 of the Criminal Code. He detailed the circumstances of the case, stating that according to the defendant Zhou Cuilan's confession at the police station, she had purchased Zhou Lanzhen and Chen Yueying twelve years ago in the Lake Region, and Chen was placed in the care of Yanfei brothel owner Pan Lao Si. In March of this year, Pan took Chen Yueying to Room 330 of the Grand China Hotel on Xizang Road, where she came to an agreement with Tan Liming (also known as Wu Huadong), a captain in a certain organization in Nanjing. Tan paid 200 yuan to deflower Chen Yueying. The police required more time to investigate this complex case in detail and therefore requested a postponement. Fei Xianglin confessed that she was sixteen years old and from the Lake Region. She had been sold as a servant to the Chen family since she was young. Four days ago, the defendants Fei Futang and Bi Chengrui took her to Shanghai from her village to sell her to Shen Runliu for 240 yuan. They lived on Baker Road. The defendant Bi Chengrui confessed that Fei's owner, Chen, was the owner of the Chen Futai Nanhuo store in Xiaang of the Lake Region, and he had known him for a long time. Recently, Fei Futang asked me to be a matchmaker, so Fei and I brought Fei to Shanghai and stayed overnight at the Hongxiang Hotel. The next day, we went to Baker Road. I asked Fei Chentang because I had a friend, Zhou Songshan, who was an employee of the Tongfeng Nanhuo store in Xiaodongmen. He had recently lost his wife, so he asked me to find a replacement. I then entrusted Bi Chengrui to negotiate with Chen Futai in Xiaang of the Lake Region and agreed to buy Fei Xianglin for 240 yuan. The victim Zhang Baozhu confessed that she was fifteen years old and from the Lake Region. Because of poverty, her mother brought her to Shanghai three weeks ago to work as a servant at Tao Guifu's house on Baker Road. Tao Amao confessed to being from Hangzhou, seventeen years old, and said the defendants Tao Guifu and Tao Yuan Shi were his biological parents. Shi was brought to them by Zhou Cuilan because his mother was recently ill and unable to work, so they hired Shi to help with chores and prepare meals. Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, after reviewing the confessions, ordered that the defendants be held in custody, that the boys and girls remain in the care of Jiliang, and adjourned the case for further hearing.</p>

<p>Curb Labor Unrest, Order the Sale of National Goods</p>
<p>Assist Distressed Factories, Relieve Unemployment: The Shanghai United Machine-Made National Goods Factories, due to the severe impact on the social economy since the September 18th Incident, have experienced sluggish sales and financial difficulties. Some factories have been forced to downsize to survive, but layoffs have often led to labor disputes. Although the responsible authorities have mediated in accordance with the law, workers often exploit their numbers and make excessive demands. As a result, the factories have not only been unable to compensate for the losses from the Shanghai War, but also face a precarious future. Yu Xueyang, Chu Wenqi, Pan Xusheng, Xiang Kangyuan, and others were delegated to petition the Municipal Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and other agencies, requesting: (1) efforts to curb labor unrest, (2) an order to sell national goods throughout the country, (3) appropriate assistance to distressed factories, and (4) prompt allocation of funds to relieve unemployment. Regarding labor disputes, at a minimum, legal sanctions should be imposed to eliminate disputes. Measures must be taken to ensure that factories have full protection and that workers never face unemployment, which would greatly benefit the future of Chinese industry. It is heard that the Municipal Government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to promptly verify and reply, and has issued the original petition and a copy of the dispute facts.</p>

(2) If each association has an evaluation committee, it should submit the evaluation committee to the Bureau for record in advance. (3) Each price should list the costs, expenses, and profits, either as percentages or as actual numbers, for review. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for your information.</p>

<p>Coppersmith Chen Yongqing Killed in Accident</p>
<p>Union Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday morning at 4:45 AM, Chen Yongqing, a night shift coppersmith at the French Concession Water and Electricity Company's old workshop, was dispatched to connect a tramcar.

Because he did not know how to operate it, he turned on the power, and Chen, who was connecting the car, was hit and his head was shattered, resulting in immediate death. The police transported the body to the morgue and detained the Russian. The factory's workers were extremely angry, and the union immediately convened an emergency meeting and instructed Chen's family to attend.

<h3 id="e198">Mediated at the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Investigate the Facts of Both Sides and Thoroughly Examine the Factory's Accounts</p>
<p>Temporarily Issue 5 Yuan in Living Expenses to Dismissed Workers: The labor dispute at the Nanshi Yihe Rubber Factory has been mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau several times without success. Peng Zhenqiu of the Social Affairs Bureau's Third Section advised both parties on Saturday (the 6th) to negotiate on their own and scheduled another round of negotiations for the 9th (yesterday). Yesterday, representatives from both sides arrived at the Bureau on time. At 2:00 PM, a negotiation meeting was held in the Bureau's conference room. The attendees included factory representatives Su Gongxuan and Zhang Bolun, representatives from the industry association Cai Chunfang and Shen Mengshi, and labor representatives Zheng Gengfu and Mei Shidu. Peng Zhenqiu presided over the meeting and first held a round of consultations, followed by both sides listing various facts, with lengthy debates. Peng then proposed two solutions, one non-thorough and one thorough. The non-thorough solution involved persuading both sides to make slight concessions in the spirit of labor-management cooperation, with the factory reinstating all sixteen dismissed workers and the workers ceasing any further disputes, thereby ending the conflict. The thorough solution acknowledged that if both sides were unwilling to compromise, there would be no end in sight. The Bureau would assign specialists and accountants to investigate the facts of the case and thoroughly examine the factory's accounts, and then make a fair decision based on this. If the factory was found to be at fault, it would be dealt with according to the law. Similarly, if the labor side was found to have engaged in absenteeism or other actions, the factory would be allowed to dismiss them unconditionally. As for the issue of bonus payments, this would be determined after reviewing the accounts to see if there was any surplus. Both sides agreed to adopt the thorough solution. The workers also requested that the factory first issue wages for May and June and last year's bonus during the investigation period to maintain their livelihoods after unemployment. Peng, in his personal capacity, advised the factory to consider the suffering of the unemployed workers and provide a small amount of money to support their lives. The factory agreed to provide 5 yuan per person, to be collected at Su Gongxuan's house between 8:00 and 9:00 AM this morning, and arranged to further discuss the solution at this time.</p>

<p>It is the Real Estate Association’s advocacy for the improvement of tap water methods, and its acquisition by the city. The cost can be issued by public debt, installed after the meter, and charged as before. A year of trial run will be conducted first. After sending a letter to the General Office of the Engineering Bureau for review, it is heard that this method is actually advocated by the Shanghai Real Estate Association. The Chinese Taxpayers Association will also consider this issue.</p>

<p>More Than Seven Times Higher Than Before</p>
<p>How Can the People Bear It in This Time of Economic Distress: The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association sent another letter to the General Office of the Engineering Bureau yesterday regarding tap water, saying: I am writing to inform you that the Ningbo Association in Shanghai wrote to us stating that since our association installed water meters from the Shanghai Tap Water Company, the water bill for July was more than seven times higher than the previous June. The company disregards public welfare and only seeks its own interests, which is regrettable. At a time when the people are suffering and the economy is on the verge of collapse, how can we bear further burdens? In addition to refusing to pay the water bill for July, we are writing to request that you quickly protest to the Engineering Bureau to correct and reduce the burden, which is what we hope for, etc. We have learned that since the installation of water meters, the base price has been too high, and water bills have increased sharply compared to the past. The association stated that it has only increased by more than double, but to the best of our knowledge, there are cases where it has increased by more than seven times. If this is not corrected, it will inevitably lead to the following results: either saving water, which will harm residents' health, or causing major disputes. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, we are writing to request that you quickly correct it. Respectfully addressed to the General Office of the Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau.

<p>The extension of the deadline will be extended for another six months from July. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all members yesterday, stating that it had received an order from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had issued an order, Business Letter No. 12611, stating that if there are any conflicts between the company's articles of association and the Company Law, they should be amended and submitted for approval within six months after the implementation of the Company Law. As the deadline of the end of December 20th was approaching, the reasons for the extension were prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which approved the extension for six months and instructed the Ministry to notify the provincial and municipal governments to comply. It is now found that this deadline will expire again on June 30th of this year. Many companies in various regions have made corrections accordingly, but there are still many companies that have not been able to make the corrections on time due to various difficulties. Moreover, the company's articles of association were originally approved as valid documents, and there was nothing wrong with them according to the old law. The legal deadline for amendment is because the new law has been implemented, and it cannot be allowed to conflict with it permanently. The short deadline is intended to make everyone comply with the new law as soon as possible. Now, because it is impossible to complete the amendments on time, in order to consider the difficulties of businesses and to make all companies' articles of association comply with the new law, the Executive Yuan's Order No. 1838 was issued again, approving a further extension of six months from July 1st of this year, etc. In addition to separate orders, we are ordering you to forward this order to all companies that have not yet amended their articles of association in accordance with the law, to comply and amend them as soon as possible, and submit them to avoid further delays. We are ordering you to follow these instructions and to forward them to all members for compliance.</p>

<p>The Sanbei Liner to be Adjusted to the Chongqing-Yichang Route: The Chongqing-Yichang route of the Sanbei Company, originally served by the Wuxing and Fuyang liners, has been affected. After the Wuxing liner encountered an accident at Chenglingji last month, only the Fuyang liner remained in operation, resulting in a lack of scheduled voyages. Ren Duqing, the manager in Yichang, recognizing this issue, telegraphed the head office requesting additional sailings. Upon receiving the telegram, the head office decided to transfer the Tianbei liner, which had been operating on the Ningbo-Zhoushan-Puzi route, to the Chongqing-Yichang route. This liner arrived in Shanghai in the middle of last month for repairs, which have now been completed, and it is scheduled to depart for Yichang this morning. After the sinking of the Wuxing liner, salvage operations were impossible due to high water levels. Attempts will be made to salvage the vessel once the water recedes.</p>
<p>The Shengjing Liner Repairs Completed and Returns to Service on the Taikoo Northern Route: The new Shengjing liner of the Taikoo Northern Route sailed from Shanghai to Tianjin for the ninth time last month. While sailing near Qingming Island near Weihaiwei, it struck a reef in the fog. After being towed out, it returned to Shanghai for repairs, which have lasted more than a month. The company received a telegram from the Hong Kong head office the other day stating that the repairs have been completed, and it is approved to return to service from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the ninth. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin at 10:00 AM on the thirteenth.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Organizing a National Goods Consumer Cooperative <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Initiated by Du Gang and Others</p>
<p>Adopting the Rochdale Principles: Since the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, the people of the entire nation have been extremely indignant, advocating for economic severance and boycotting enemy goods as a form of resistance. To this day, the blood of our oaths has not yet dried, but some unscrupulous merchants only seek profit, often passing off enemy goods as domestic goods, deceiving themselves and others. This has led to a lack of identification capabilities for patriotic citizens, who are unable to avoid buying enemy goods even if they desire to do so. Du Gang, Xu Jiashi, Du Mengsen, and others, recognizing that enemy goods may never be completely eliminated if this continues, have initiated the organization of a National Goods Consumer Cooperative as a fundamental means of resistance. Since the news spread, more than fifty people have requested to join as initiators, and the number continues to grow. It is reported that the cooperative is tentatively named the "Greater Shanghai Limited Consumer Cooperative." Draft articles of association have been prepared, adopting the principles of the British Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society, setting the share capital at five yuan per share, with each member required to subscribe to at least one share. A preparatory office has been established at 118 Rue Lupan in the French Concession. It is also heard that the future location of the cooperative is planned to be in the central area of the French Concession, and branch cooperatives or offices will be established in various locations as the cooperative develops. This type of organization is the best method for resisting enemy goods, and the China Cooperative Society is also very appreciative and willing to help.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Supporting the Party Headquarters' Rent Reduction Proposal <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The Simalu Businessmen's Association and the 20th District Branch of the Citizens' Union have issued a declaration in support of the Shanghai Party Headquarters' proposal to reduce or waive rent:</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The prosperity of the city's commerce and the density of the population are unparalleled in the nation. Demand exceeds supply, and it is further manipulated by some unbenevolent wealthy merchants. As a result, rents have been increasing day by day, with rent alone accounting for half of all expenditures, especially in our central district. In normal times, with a prosperous market and good business, we can barely maintain our livelihood by tightening our belts and working hard. However, with two months of market closures and spending continuing, coupled with a sluggish market and plummeting business after the war, we are economizing on food and clothing to survive, while rent remains as high as ever, without any reduction due to the economic difficulties of society or any exemption for the inability of citizens to live in peace. How can this be fair in law or in principle? The city government's proposed rent reduction or waiver measures are indeed biased and unfair, disregarding the merchants and residents of our central district. The city party headquarters can consider the hardships of the merchants and seek welfare for the common people, and thus has petitioned the National Government to send personnel to Shanghai to jointly re-establish rent reduction standards with party and government agencies and mass organizations. This proposal truly understands the suffering of the merchants and residents, and the members of this association express their deepest sympathy and will definitely support its implementation to alleviate the suffering of our merchants and residents and restore the former prosperity of the market. We hereby declare.</p>

<p>French Concession police detectives previously cracked a roulette gambling den at 809 Route Cardinal Mercier, seizing gambling equipment and smoking paraphernalia, and arresting twenty-seven people, including Russian Bai Xigaofu and Chinese Chen Jiande, who were sent to the court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo conducted a preliminary hearing and declared the debate concluded, setting a date for sentencing. It has now been found by Detective Bao that Wang Xianfu, a Taizhou native residing at No. 3 Zengrong Lane, Elague Road, is a member of the gambling outfit. He was mistakenly arrested as a gambler at the time. After the arrest, the head detective ordered him to be released on bail of 30 yuan in cash to await further instructions. However, Wang did not appear after being released, and was arrested by the detectives on the night before last and sent to the Second Special Court yesterday. The original debate on the previous case was reopened. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahan clarified the case and requested that it be handled according to law. The defendant was defended by lawyer Wang Shizong, who denied being the owner and claimed to be a gambler, requesting an investigation. The court ordered Wang to pay 2,000 yuan in cash bail and adjourned the hearing for another day. Since Wang was unable to pay the cash, he submitted a request to change the bail to shop bail, which was approved yesterday.</p>

<p>Seeking Damages of More Than 13,000 Yuan: Yao Guishan, a local resident who lived at Wangjiatai, Gaolang Bridge, and worked as a rattan chair maker, had an affair with Wang Wanshi, the wife of Wang Xingsheng, a carpenter. In March of this year, he abducted her to Zhoupu, Pudong, to live together. Wang found her and took her back. On July 3, Yao met Wang Wanshi outside Xiaodongmen, Shiliupu, to arrange a secret meeting at the Oriental Hotel. The husband found out, carried a handgun, chased them to No. 33 Yuxing Street, Xiaodongmen, French Concession, and fired two shots at Yao's back, hitting him in the waist and buttocks. The patrol police arrested the husband, Wang, recovered the handgun and bullets, and took him to the police station. Yao was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The husband and wife were sent to the Second Special Court for investigation. Yao died on the fourth of this month due to his injuries. The prosecutor examined the body and the body was claimed. This case was heard yesterday by Judge Wang Gangxi and Prosecutor Wu Xiaoke in the Criminal Division. The police first prosecuted for assault, but now changed the charges to assault causing death. The plaintiff, Yao's father, Yao Jiahai, hired lawyer Xue Jiaqi as an agent and requested incidental civil compensation of 6,000 yuan for the deceased's loss of life, 3,240 yuan for the deceased's two daughters' living expenses, 500 yuan for the deceased's funeral expenses, and 3,840 yuan for the deceased's father's support, totaling 13,580 yuan, and stated that the defendant had several acres of land in Yinxiang Port, worth 5,000-6,000 yuan per acre, and that the defendant had the ability to pay the incidental civil suit. The court questioned the details of the affair, the abduction, and the intention to harm the victim. The defendant's lawyers, Zhang Ji and Qin Zemin, stated that the facts of the case were clear, that the debate could be opened today, and there was no need to postpone it. Regarding the private prosecution, the defendant did not have the financial ability to bear such a huge loss. The court ordered the hearing to be adjourned. The lawyers for both parties were ordered to settle the private prosecution out of court.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the First Special Court opened the trial of Weng Yuanzhen, the young owner of Qingfu Pawnshop at No. 2649 Yangshupu Road, Shanghai, who, on June 18, killed his two partners, Jiang Zhenfang from Huizhou and Li Guannan from Luodian, because of the embezzlement of funds. The victims' families directly hired lawyers Xu Kaixian and Zhang Henghai to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, requesting the arrest and severe punishment of the murderers and demanding compensation from Weng Yongjun (the murderer Weng Yuanzhen's father) in the Civil Division to maintain the livelihood of the victims' families. Unexpectedly, Weng Yongjun published a notice in the newspaper the other day, entrusting lawyers to hastily declare liquidation, apparently trying to conceal assets and escape all legal responsibility. The family had no choice but to ask Fang Peiqing, a relative in Shanghai, to represent them and appeal to all sectors of society, uniting lawyers Xu and Zhang to expedite legal procedures, while publishing a rebuttal in the newspaper, denying the liquidation. It is learned that Fang, out of familial ties and a sense of duty, invited friends and relatives of Jiang and Li, including Zhang Zhizhi and Sun Wenhai, to No. 1246 Huade Road the other day to discuss ways to proceed. It was resolved to organize the Jiang Li Massacre Shanghai Relatives Support Association to provide strong assistance, and a declaration was issued, describing the truth of the massacre and requesting practical assistance from all organizations and local fair-minded people. A temporary contact address was set up at No. 1246 Huade Road. It is also learned that the case was opened in the First Special Court yesterday morning, and the lawyers for both parties were present in court. The plaintiff's lawyer Xu requested that the defendant's business records for the past years be reviewed to preserve evidence, which was approved by the court and a date for a retrial was set.</p>

After about a few minutes, they walked out the front door and left. The total amount of freight money stolen was 424.90 yuan. The bureau chief has been notified. As the robbery occurred in broad daylight, which is extremely unlawful, the head of the Shanghai section police has been ordered to solve the case within a time limit.</p>

<p>The Thief and the Receiver of Stolen Goods are Both Convicted: Yang Chongyuan, a clerk at the Beihengmao Customs Brokerage at No. 59 Guangdong Road, successively colluded with his uncle Yang Yushan to steal 116 sweaters entrusted to the brokerage for customs clearance, which they then sold and split the profits. After the owner noticed the theft, he reported it to the General Police Station, which sent Detective Song Yuanshan and Detective Huang Fusen to arrest the two Yangs. It was also determined that the stolen goods were privately received by the Huaxin Company on Yinhua Street, Nanjing Road. After searching the company, the police found 102 original stolen sweaters. The missing 14 items had already been sold. The police charged Liang Zhengpei, the manager of Huaxin, with receiving stolen goods, and charged the two Yangs with joint theft, and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Liu opened a retrial. Police lawyer Hu Jiabao stated that the case had been thoroughly investigated, the evidence was conclusive, and he requested severe punishment. Liang Zhengpei still tried to evade responsibility and hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng for defense. Judge Liu finished the hearing and immediately announced the verdict: Yang Chongyuan was sentenced to six months in prison, Yang Yushan was sentenced to four months in prison, Liang Zhengpei was fined 400 yuan, and the stolen goods were returned to the original owner for collection. The value of the 14 sold items must be compensated. As Liang declared he was not satisfied with the verdict and would appeal, the court ordered the stolen goods to be temporarily stored at the police station pending review by the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>The woman Sun Jiang, 20 years old, from Ningbo, resided at No. 448 Rue Au Ga. The other night, she had an argument with her husband while cooling off on the sundeck. Feeling resentful, she wanted to end her life and swallowed opium smoke without anyone knowing. The next morning, her aunt Sun Shen and others found her and took her to the Gu Long Hospital for treatment. She died at 5:00 PM that afternoon. The hospital reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Forensic Center on Feren Road. Yesterday morning, Inspector Guo, appointed by the First Special District Local Court, examined the body and conducted a court session. Sun Shen stated that her family ran a steel shop, and the deceased was her daughter-in-law. That day, when the two of them were cooling off, her son was lying on the couch, and the deceased was sitting next to him. Later, her son asked the deceased to get clothes, and an argument broke out. The deceased's father, Jiang Lianqing, 47 years old, from Ningbo, a Jinghua merchant from Shiliupu in the South City, stated that his daughter had been married for two years, but she had only returned home twice, and returned to her husband's home on the same day. He had repeatedly gone to their home, but had never seen his daughter. Their family was very secretive and mistreated his daughter. Her husband has now fled. He requested the Inspector to seek justice. After hearing the statements, Inspector Guo ruled that Sun Jiang had committed suicide by opium poisoning and ordered the body to be handed over to her aunt Sun Shen for burial.</p>

<p>Purchased from a French Ship: He Kaifei, a Cantonese man, was found to be carrying prohibited handgun ammunition at about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. While riding in a rickshaw, traveling on Broadway, he was spotted by Chinese detective Feng Shuofu, who found his appearance suspicious and stopped him immediately. A bag of bullets was found on him, with twenty-five rounds in each box, a total of twenty boxes of bullets. He was taken to the police station. He confessed that he had been working as a chief steward on the French Merchant Godtese liner for three years. He had purchased the ammunition from France for 7 yuan per hundred rounds. After the ship arrived in Shanghai on the 7th of this month, he went to the Banjuqing Amusement Club at No. 450 Wuchang Road to play, and met a friend named A Liang, who asked if he had any ammunition for sale. He said he only had 500 rounds, and it was agreed that the price would be 10 yuan per hundred rounds, and they would be delivered that day. Unexpectedly, he was arrested en route. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, where he was questioned by Judge Fu.

<p>Gaoqiao Municipal Committee member Zhong Renjie submitted a letter to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that he was resigning for a continuation and asking to be replaced with an alternate. With the expectation of grace and approval, the letter said: Because Renjie concurrently holds commercial positions in Shanghai, it is difficult to attend to municipal facilities and arrangements. On May 5, an instruction was received stating: "The presentation has been understood, but the work must be done with difficulty as before, and the request should be discussed without discussion." After reading this, I was terrified. Realizing Renjie's longstanding concurrent commercial position, serving the hometown, the responsibility is always to feel this and lose that, spiritual pain, not just morning and night. Now, at the time of strict local autonomy, to promote post-war municipal administration, Renjie's commercial position, more and more often to leave Shanghai, delay back and forth, it is difficult to deal with. If the delay continues, private and public distress, neither benefits the city, more hinders the person, must the Superior consider the foolish heart, to resign from the position of municipal committee of Gaoqiao District, Renjie deeply desires to retire to the position of citizen, still to be able to see what is heard, at any time to assist the city. Zhao Shiren, a member of the unit, is a local resident, graduated from the special class of the Municipal Local Autonomy Training Institute, has been long assisting the work, and is very clear about the local situation. If allowed to be appointed, the city's future will be able to handle properly, and public opinion is very agreeable. For all the reasons for the continued resignation of the commissioner, it is urgently prepared in writing and submitted, expecting grace and approval for implementation, and awaiting orders with excitement.</p>

<p>According to the Zilin Daily, telephone thieves have been quite active lately. The Shanghai Telephone Company issued a special warning to all users to pay attention. However, the other day (the eighth), the thieves took advantage of the opportunity to steal a telephone from the fire brigade. It is said that two people, posing as telephone company mechanics, entered the office of the deputy captain of the fire brigade and removed a telephone. There were two telephones in the room, one connected directly to the telephone company switchboard, and the other connected to the fire department's main line. The stolen phone was the one connected to the switchboard, indicating that the thief must be familiar with the situation. In the past year, many workers have installed the fire brigade's telephone network, so no one suspected the two thieves of impersonating the company.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the news published in yesterday's (9th) edition of your newspaper under the heading ("The Zhu Shaoyi Case: Disputes Intensify"), which included a subheading ("Anti-Zhu Faction Workers Assault Neutral Faction Workers"), we find the content to be factually inaccurate and deeply disconcerting. The anti-Zhu movement is purely the result of the majority of workers being unable to bear the oppression of Zhu Shaoyi, leading to a united uprising under the leadership of the entire labor union. There is no distinction between an "anti-Zhu faction" and a "neutral faction." Furthermore, since Lu Jiyun and Chuan Chongde are responsible personnel of the labor union and did not participate in the work of posting slogans and distributing leaflets, the entire labor union is naturally responsible and has nothing to do with Lu and Chuan. As for Zhang Ruoyu, Hu Ruizhang, Zhan Yongyi, etc., who were allegedly assaulted and falsely accused union members in court, whether they were actually assaulted is questionable. Your newspaper's claim that the dispute is intensifying is entirely inconsistent with the facts, and we are concerned that it may mislead various circles. Therefore, we specifically request that your newspaper promptly make corrections to clarify the truth. We are deeply hopeful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>First District Water and Electricity Industry Labor Union, August 9th.</p>

<p>**Six Meridian Canals**</p>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Guangzhou has been struck by devastating rainstorms, breaking decades-old records! According to reports in the Guangdong newspapers, countless citizens have drowned and countless houses have collapsed. The pitiful Home for the Elderly has been turned into a crystal palace! The lonely old men and women have all become drowned rats! Statistics show that more than three hundred people have drowned in the two male and female residences, not including other affected citizens. One can only hum two lines of classical text: "The heartbreaking scene is truly like this?"</p>
<p>An investigation into the cause of the disaster reveals that the problem lies in the poor drainage of the canals. The canals that Guangzhou relies on to drain rainwater are called the "Six Meridian Canals." The name "Six Meridian" is well chosen: if a person's six meridians are out of balance, the person will fall ill; if the water's six meridians are blocked, the water will overflow. In the past, the municipal authorities always treated dredging the six meridian canals as an important task. But now, the officials in charge of public works have actually narrowed the main canal and tightened its mouth; with a narrow mouth, the excessive amount of rainwater cannot be drained in time, and this unprecedented tragedy has occurred! Therefore, the word "violent" in the "violent rain disaster" is simply unfair to the Rain Master; the rain is not violent, it is the officials who narrowed the canal mouth who are violent. I think that the tangible six meridian canals must be dredged at all times, and the intangible six meridian canals cannot be tightened. The more open and accessible all public opinion and media organizations are, the clearer the political situation will be. If they also adopt a narrowing policy and tighten their mouths, then preventing the people's speech is more dangerous than preventing a river. The intangible violent rain disaster is even more unmanageable than the tangible violent rain disaster.</p>
<p>The overflow of Guangzhou's Six Meridian Canals is a good lesson for the government officials to learn.</p>

<p>**Yan, the Historian Who Defended Jiangyin**</p>
<p>— Shi Junshuo</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yi-wu recounts the story of Yan, the Recorder, who defended Jiangyin. (Mr. Wang mistakenly referred to Yan as Yan). The intention is to commend the loyalty and patriotism of the Northeast Volunteers, and to hate the unpatriotic officials in high positions who lack integrity. He hopes that they will be grateful to the volunteer army and be able to regain lost territory by force, which is well-intentioned. However, the surname of Yan, the Recorder, was mistaken, and his given name, place of origin, and the events of his arrival in Jiangyin to protect the area were not detailed. Therefore, I will fill in the gaps for the benefit of the newspaper readers, so that those who admire heroes will have something to study. According to the Biography of Yan Ying-yuan, the Recorder of Shaoqingmen, Yan, the Recorder, whose name was Ying-yuan and courtesy name was Li-heng, was originally from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and later his family settled in Tongzhou, Zhili. Ying-yuan started as a clerk and served as an official in the Beijing Granary. In the fourteenth year of Chongzhen, he was transferred to Jiangyin as a recorder. When he first arrived, there were a hundred Jiangyin pirates, who set up banners and took advantage of the tide to enter the interior, approaching the city. The county magistrate was temporarily governing a neighboring county, and the officials were fleeing. Men and women ran away. Ying-yuan went out with a sword and quiver, and shouted from his horse in the market: "Good men, follow me to kill the bandits and protect your families!" At that time, a thousand people followed him. But there were no banners. Ying-yuan then rushed to the bamboo shop and shouted: "The situation is urgent! Lend me a pole each!" A thousand people stood on the riverbank, their spears like a forest, the soldiers like a wall. Ying-yuan rode back and forth, shooting arrows. Each arrow killed a bandit. Three bandits were killed in a row, and the pirates were so frightened that they lowered their sails and left. (Nowadays, bandits and thieves abound. The officials who govern this land usually send troops and police to pursue after the bandits have looted and fled far away. Should they not be ashamed to death compared to Yan, the Recorder?) Later, Ying-yuan was promoted to a registrar in a certain county in Guangdong, but he did not go due to his mother's illness. When the national crisis occurred, he took his family to live in Shanshan, east of the county. (The following is a slightly abridged version.) The Prince Regent's army crossed the Yangtze River and sent princes and other generals to pacify the southeastern counties. From Jingkou onwards, in one month, they captured hundreds of famous cities and counties. Jiangyin, a small town, held out for more than eighty days before falling. Ying-yuan's plans were mostly responsible for this. At first, when the shaving order was issued, the students, led by Xu Yong-de, cried in the Minglun Hall. Tens of thousands of people gathered, wanting to support County Lieutenant Chen Ming-xuan to defend the city. Ming-xuan said, "My wisdom and courage are not as good as Mr. Yan's. This is a major matter. Mr. Yan must come." So he rode at night to welcome Ying-yuan. Ying-yuan got up and rushed to the city with his family at night. After preparing the necessary equipment, he divided the city to defend it. Wu Ju Huang Lue defended the east gate, Bazong defended the south gate, Chen Mingxuan defended the west gate, and Yingyuan defended the north gate. After the deployment was completed, the city was surrounded. The city was defended for eighty-one days. The main army surrounded the city with 250,000 troops, and 67,000 died. Another 7,000 died in street battles. No less than 56,000 people died in the city. Corpses were piled up everywhere, and the streets and alleys were filled. However, not a single person surrendered. In the middle, they once sent brave men to scale the walls into the camp at night and set fire to it with the wind. The army was in chaos, and many were trampled to death. The army retreated and stopped camping three miles from the city. The commander, Liu Liangzuo, rode to the city and shouted, "I have a close relationship with Mr. Yan and want to see him." Ying-yuan stood on the city and spoke to him. Liu was one of the four generals of Hongguang and was enfeoffed as the Earl of Guangchang. He had already surrendered and was now an officer. He remotely said to Ying-yuan, "Hongguang has fled, and Jiangnan has no master. Surrender early, and you can be guaranteed wealth and honor." Ying-yuan said, "I am just a recorder of the Ming Dynasty, but I still know righteousness. General, you have been given land and a fiefdom and are an important general of the country. You cannot protect Jianghuai but instead become a vanguard for the enemy. What face do you have to meet the righteous men of our city?" Liangzuo retreated in shame. Ying-yuan had a great stature, a dark complexion, a slight beard, and a strict and resolute nature. His orders were solemn and no one dared to disobey. He was generous and not stingy with rewards. When he spoke to brave men, he always called them "good brothers" instead of their names. Chen Mingxuan patrolled the city every day, comforting the soldiers and sharing their hardships, sometimes to the point of tears. Therefore, both men were able to win the hearts of the people, and the soldiers were willing to die for them. According to the Biography of Yan, the Recorder of Qingmen, there are nearly two thousand words. Here, I have excerpted the main points to show the outline of the defense of the city. As for the donation of large sums of money, Cheng Bi, a student of the Imperial College, first donated 25,000 gold as an initiative, and the donors gathered like clouds. They were all grateful for Mr. Yan's righteousness. Mr. Yan had already been promoted to an official in another province. A retired recorder still had the responsibility to defend the land like this.</p>

<p>**Record of the Opening of the Study and Art Society**</p>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>There are two major academic institutions in Shanghai: the Chinese Vocational Education Society and the Chinese Study and Art Society. The former is rich in practical capabilities, while the latter has a research nature. The promotion of Chinese culture relies heavily on them. On July 31st, the Chinese Study and Art Society held its opening ceremony. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, I drove to the society on Ai Mai Yu Xian Road to participate. Upon arrival, Ou Zhihuai, Zhou Changshou, and others hung a big red flower and wore yellow reception ribbons to diligently welcome guests into the venue. Cai Yuanpei, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, He Bocheng, and Ye Gongchuo sat solemnly on the platform, preparing for the meeting. The bell rang and the curtain opened. Fu Shishuo, chairman of the society's board of directors, gave a speech. Ma Zongrong, the executive director, reported on the society's seventeen-year history. The guests on the platform all had insightful speeches. Cai spoke in Shaoxing dialect, elaborating on the words "study and art" in great detail. Liang spoke loudly and extensively, full of energy. Could this be a case of "the older, the stronger?" Liang has recently been engaged in rural movements and hopes that the practical application of academics and art will be widespread in the countryside and have an impact. Ge Gongzhen was afraid of being dragged on stage to speak, so he slipped away halfway. The chairman couldn't find him, but the old man was in a corner of the west building, leaning against the railing and talking about the way to save the country with the members of the Newspaper Society. As the sun set, the guests visited the new building. The society occupies an area of 2.4 mu, three times larger than the Chinese Vocational Education Society. It is a modern building with a completely three-dimensional straight line design, incorporating Indian and French elements. The roof decoration is like a Christmas cake, beautiful and appetizing. The furnishings are also exquisite and modern. It is said that the design and construction were all undertaken voluntarily by member Liu Shiying, costing a total of 200,000 gold, which can be said to be cheap and beautiful. However, I dislike the auditorium's structure, as the sound does not gather well, and the platform is too small to be fully utilized. The society currently has more than twenty branches, scattered around the world like stars. There are 672 members, with each province having members, but Zhejiang accounts for the most. Among them, 463 graduates from foreign universities account for nearly two-thirds of the total. Most of them study engineering and science. There are twelve categories of publications, totaling 147 kinds, in addition to the Study and Art Magazine. The 128 Shanghai difficulties were destroyed by business affairs. They will all be looted in one day. Study art, after this, you should work harder.</p>

<p>**A Discussion on the Medicinal Uses of Watermelon**</p>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Having read Mr. Shizi's "Random Talks on Watermelon" in Free Talk, which mentions that watermelon rind can be pickled and used as a side dish, but does not detail its medicinal uses, I believe he is not a true connoisseur of watermelon. Based on what I know, I will briefly mention a few things and offer my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Watermelon is also called "cold melon" because it originated in the Western Regions. Ouyang Xiu's "Four Barbarians Supplement" in the History of the Five Dynasties states that the Khitans, who lived in the Qidan region, first ate watermelon. It is said that the Khitans conquered the Uyghurs and obtained this species. Therefore, Xinjiang, Hami, and other places are very rich in watermelons today. Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" of the Ming Dynasty states that Tao Hongjing's annotations on watermelon stalks mention that Emperor Huai of Jin in Yongjia had very large cold melons that could be stored until spring. This means that watermelon seeds had already entered Zhejiang at that time, but there was no name for watermelon. There are many plants and animals that did not originate in China. Yuan Wei-zhi of the Tang Dynasty wrote a poem: "In what year did the kingdom of Anshi send pomegranates ten thousand miles as tribute?" It is said that pomegranate is also called Ruoliu or Anshi Pomegranate. Zhang Qian, the envoy of the Han Dynasty, went to the Western Regions and brought back pomegranate seeds from the kingdom of Anshi. This was the beginning of pomegranates in China. Watermelon is also similar. Li Shizhen did not study the classics and devoted himself to medicine. The "Biographies of Fangji" in the History of Ming highly praised him. The medicinal use of watermelon began with Li Shizhen.</p>
<p>Typhoid fever, also known as intestinal obstruction typhus, is a very dangerous disease in autumn and summer. The cause of the disease is drinking dirty water, eating too many melons and fruits, and sleeping in the open air, which allows the germs to run rampant. The fever is highest in the second and third weeks after the onset of the disease. A slight carelessness in treatment can often lead to death. Traditional Chinese medicine is more effective in treating this disease. Some medicines use cold drugs such as antelope horn and gypsum, but watermelon is the only specific drug. (Western doctors often use ice packs to treat patients with high fever, which is very dangerous and not as good as drinking watermelon juice. Also, we must never turn on the electric fan when we fall asleep, because I know that many people have died from this. Be careful, be careful!) Therefore, it is advisable to store one or two watermelons at home in autumn and winter in case of emergency. It is not only for cooling off the summer heat. My late mother fell ill with typhoid fever at an early age and almost died, but she was cured with watermelon.)</p>
<p>Dropsy is often caused by the kidneys failing to perform their excretory function. Watermelon has diuretic properties, so it is a special medicine for kidney disease. The method is to stuff the watermelon rind with garlic, coat the outside of the watermelon with mud, and bake it over a low fire. After the mud dries, drink the watermelon juice to treat dropsy. Some say to stuff the watermelon with rooster droppings and drink the juice, but it seems not as clean as garlic.</p>
<p>Cut watermelon rind into powder and mix it with lime and sesame oil to make a liquid, which is a wonderful medicine for burns. It immediately relieves pain after application and has antiseptic properties. There is a saying: "Watermelon is also known as Baihu Tang. Eating it in hot weather is harmless." This is true. However, I have heard Zhen Xishan say: "Melons and peaches are cold and should be eaten in small amounts, lest they cause malaria and dysentery in the autumn." Huang Lusu said: "People all say that watermelon can ward off the heat and do not avoid it when it is cold. But they do not know that after running around in the heat, they feel a stuffiness in their chest. If they eat it cold, although it can ward off the heat, it is ultimately harmful. If they sit in a high hall and eat it regularly, it will damage their spleen and stomach." Also, it is extremely dangerous to eat watermelon after a house party or waking up. Be careful not to think that eating watermelon to satiety is harmless. Gentlemen, please be aware. Thank you for submitting your manuscript in July. A small amount of remuneration has been prepared.

<p>**Chatting in the Quiet Studio**</p>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui</p>
<p>Western universities call students with deep scholarship and excellent academic performance after graduation "doctors." This is not something that can be achieved by luck. But now, people who are not scholars pretend to be, and scholars who are not broad pretend to be. Thus, doctors are as numerous as feathers. Chinese people who go to Europe and America to study mostly obtain this title and return as a social ornament. When asked about the way to become a doctor, they stare blankly and cannot say a word. Even actors who occasionally show off their skills are given this elegant title and become proud. Is this the doctor's good fortune or misfortune? Wang Chonghui can truly be called a doctor who lives up to his name. His courtesy name is Liangchou and he is from Dongguan, Guangdong. He is a Doctor of Law from America. He returned to China in the year of Xinhai and was appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Government. It was unprecedented in the history of the founding of the country for a scholar to suddenly hold such a great responsibility. He held office for a short time, but his reputation was outstanding. When the government moved north and merged to form a unified government, he was appointed Minister of Justice on the recommendation of Tang Shaoyi. When Shaoyi retired, he left with him, hiding in Shanghai and working as a translator for the China Bookstore. He usually wore a Western suit and carried a cane, walking on the streets. His appearance was not striking, and those who saw him did not know that he was a high-ranking official. He was reappointed as Minister of Justice and served in the governments of Li, Feng, Xu, and Cao. During that time, he also held the reins of power with Wang Zhengting, Yan Huiqing, Huang Fu, Gu Weijun, and others, known as the New Diplomacy Faction. When Cao Kun used bribery to control the country, the people of the Privy Council often did not understand what was being discussed. Chonghui smiled silently. When asked why, he said, "For a senior official, being able to say yes during the day is already a top choice, why bother understanding things?" Others found him easy-going and were happy to be close to him. Therefore, although he was a member of the Kuomintang, he was not resented. After the party came to power, he still held judicial power. Jokers mocked him as an elder of the Six Dynasties. Hu Hanmin defended him, saying, "Chonghui served in the Northern Court for a long time, secretly observing the government's actions. (Without harming individuals, he benefits our party.) This is not something I know." Hu's words should be credible.</p>

<p>**Notes on Striking the Bell at the Ancient Temple (70)**</p>
<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu</p>
<p>Seventy-Seven I said... (The question of changing a school into a factory or a work-study group is a major issue that can be discussed at length. Let me think about it carefully. Fortunately, no one seems to be putting the responsibility of education administration for a province or a country on my shoulders, so there doesn't seem to be any need to rush to a solution. But our ancient temple's work-study group is a must, and we need to consider early on what kind of work we should focus on for production.) Mr. Zhu said... (I saw a strange phenomenon at the ancient temple. You produce cotton here, don't you? You sell the cotton cheaply, but everyone wears expensive cloth! Isn't that strange?) (That's indeed strange! I never thought of that. Reading books too much is called a bookworm; we're really just farming too much, turning into a group of (field fools). Selling cotton cheap and buying old cloth for a lot of money, the field fools are indeed suffering a lot. So what's the solution?) Mr. Zhu said: (Cotton, coarse yarn, old cloth; quilts, mattresses, shoes, socks, jackets, pants; self-grown, self-woven, self-used, economic defense consolidated.)</p>

<p>**The Brilliant Arguments of Scholar Wu**</p>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Since Scholar Wu telegraphed his resignation and secluded himself to study, we have not heard his high-minded arguments for a long time. Now, reading his letter to Chiang Kai-shek, urging him to quickly determine national policies, clearly promulgate a constitution, and reorganize ethical norms, etc., his words are profound, earnest, and clear. I greatly admire him, but I have both satisfied and dissatisfied views on what he says.</p>
<p>He says, "(Ritual and education are the mother of society, and morality has no distinction between East and West, old and new)," etc. What he considers ritual, education, and morality are still the Three Cardinal Guides, the Five Constant Virtues, the Eight Virtues, and the Nine Classics. This is, after all, too old-fashioned. In fact, the problem with China now is that after the old ritual and education were destroyed, no new ritual and education were established; after the old morality was destroyed, no new morality was inherited. Because there are good aspects of the old ritual and education, and there are bad aspects of the old ritual and education; there are good aspects of the old morality, and there are bad aspects of the old morality. In short, a country has its own ritual, education, and morality. If the old ritual and education are gone, and there is no new ritual and education, how can this become a country?</p>
<p>In ancient times, the sage kings established rituals and made music after achieving great achievements, to express the constitution and culture of a generation. Therefore, the Three Kings had different rituals, and the Five Emperors had different music. Rituals and education change with the times. Therefore, the old rituals and education are not applicable to modern trends. This is undeniable by anyone. As for morality, in the past, our country emphasized chivalrous morality, but now, countries emphasize broad morality. Therefore, the morality emphasized by each country is nothing more than two points: what is the highest goal of morality, and how can it be the final end of our people? If we study the history of Western ethics, we know that foreigners have never been without morality.</p>
<p>Now, the old ritual and education and the old morality of our country have long been overthrown. May I ask, where are the new ritual and education? Where is the new morality? In the past, husbands had the "seven grounds for divorce" against their wives, which were truly traitors to humanity. Now, there are eight or nine grounds for divorce, and there are no articles to limit them. In the past, if children were bad, parents could sue them for disobedience. Now, children can sue their parents for disobedience. The Soviet Russian Communist Party only wants to overthrow capitalism, but now anyone in our country wants to overthrow it. It is truly a case of "the superiors have no moral standards, the inferiors have no laws to follow, the guiding principles have fallen to the ground, and orders are not carried out." This cannot be blamed on the badness of the new ritual and education, but on the badness of having no ritual and education; it cannot be blamed on the badness of the new morality, but on the badness of having no morality.</p>
<p>Scholar Wu secludes himself to study, specializing in the study of our country's sacred scriptures and biographies of sages, and has gained some insights. However, I am afraid that he has not yet observed the root cause of the ills of the times with sufficient clarity?</p>

<p>**A Summer Cooling Poem in Shanghai**</p>
<p>— Rang Shui</p>
<p>After reading Cao Yishi's preface at the Shanghai City God Temple, which includes the sentence "(The sea pirate Zhang Mingzhen)", I wrote a poem to correct it and to encourage the present age:</p>
<p>The fortunes of the world rise and fall, and human ethics emphasize the guiding principles. Where is the home when the country is destroyed? The righteous army was the first to advocate. Recalling the roof of the Ming Dynasty, the cauldrons boiled and the soup seethed again. The Chinese and barbarians fought for the boundaries, and the Central Plains chased deer on the field. Jianghuai has fallen, and the disaster has spread to the sea. At that time, they supported the descendants of Ming, and there were two Zhangs in the Zhejiang River. They tried hard to restore the society and reported to our late emperor. The eight Fujian connected to the southern road, and the three Wu strengthened the northern defense. The banner of righteousness looked to where it pointed, and the Han people were so grand. Even this city of Shanghai was restored as it should be. In the City God's text, he wrote "The Sea Pirate Zhang" in large letters. Emperor Si's soil is not yet dry, and Tang Gui is long in time. Who is the new assistant to the mandate, but forgets the national mourning? I am a robber, but people are not robbers, and you are too ungrateful. Duke Zhang resisted foreign insults, and the brothers did not fight each other. The names of Mingzhen and Huangyan are loyal and righteous, shining like the sun and moon. The former ruler is gone, but how can the motherland be forgotten? Those in the teachings should strive, and the seeds of reading should be strong. One army and one brigade at a time, many scholars reported to many sides. Success means the spirit of the state, and failure also means the glory of the nation. To this day, the dynasty history spreads the fragrance of surnames. Other hermits can taste the Shangshan ferns. It is not that they do not eat the Zhou grain, but that they want to settle the Yu territory. The destruction of the country is important to the clan and society, and great righteousness lies in stabilizing the country. It should be written that someone advocated justice, and raising troops is harmless. Those who flatter foreigners want to devour the virtuous. Alas, Cao Yishi, polluting this article.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Methods for Inspecting Canned Goods <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuo Tao</p>
<p>Aside from bottled canned goods, where we can observe the contents through the glass to determine their quality, we have no way of inspecting the contents of ordinary cans to determine their quality. Buying canned goods is a gamble; if you get a good one, that's good, but if you get a bad one, you're out of luck. A bad can not only results in economic loss but is also harmful to health because the contents of a bad can undergo many changes and contain toxic substances. Occasionally, people inadvertently eat bad canned goods and contract various difficult-to-treat diseases. Therefore, we must be careful when buying canned goods. I will now describe the most common methods for inspecting canned goods, as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Appearance: Since we cannot observe the contents of ordinary canned goods from the outside, nor can we open them to inspect them on the spot, we can only estimate the quality of the contents by observing the external shape of the can, specifically by observing whether the lid or bottom is bulging. If the can is thoroughly degassed during manufacturing and adequately heated, the air inside the can will be thin, and the lid and bottom should appear concave, indicating a good can. If the container is poorly manufactured, or degassing and heating are incomplete, the lid and bottom of the can will often bulge, indicating communication between the inside and outside air,</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>or that the contents have decayed and are producing gas. The appearance inspection method is generally applicable to most canned goods, except for aerated and bottled varieties.</p>
<p>2.  Tapping: Even after an appearance inspection, it may still be impossible to determine the quality of the can. A tapping inspection is also needed before a determination can be made. For a tapping inspection, use a metal or hardwood (even a balance beam is acceptable) stick to lightly tap the lid and bottom of the can, using the clarity of the sound to distinguish the quality of the contents. The sound will vary depending on the type of contents, the preparation method, the amount of liquid, and the shape of the container. Generally, a clear, solid sound indicates a good can, while a hollow, muddy sound usually indicates a bad can.</p>

<h3 id="e249">My Views on Improving Ancestral Worship <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Proposer: Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Everyone has ancestors, and we often perform ancestral worship to remember them. However, I feel that modern ancestral worship is too costly. Not counting birthdays and death anniversaries, ordinary families inevitably perform ancestral worship at least six times a year: Qingming Festival, Summer Solstice, Ghost Festival (July 15th), October Festival, Winter Solstice, and New Year's Eve. When performing ancestral worship, wealthy families spend tens or hundreds of dollars, but even middle- and lower-class families spend at least two or three dollars to prepare dishes, light incense and candles, and burn tin foil. This adds up to about twenty dollars a year. Furthermore, small offerings are required on ancestors' birthdays and death anniversaries.</p>
<p>To this day, we have not obtained sufficient proof of the existence of ghosts, so why is it necessary to burn so many dishes during ancestral worship? The dishes are placed on the table and remain untouched after the ritual. As for lighting incense and candles and burning tin foil, they are even more pointless and simply waste money.</p>
<p>Considering this, should we stop performing ancestral worship altogether? Of course not. If we do not worship our ancestors, future generations will forget them completely. Therefore, I believe that ancestral worship is essential, but we should change the method to avoid all unnecessary expenses. Currently, most people only focus on the formalities of ancestral worship, such as how many dishes to prepare and how much tin foil to burn, without genuine respect. This is fundamentally wrong.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to propose a few methods for improving ancestral worship, for discussion with readers:</p>
<p>(1) Reduce the number of ancestral worship ceremonies from six to two per year, implementing spring and autumn ceremonies, as six is too many and too cumbersome.</p>
<p>(2) Do not light incense or candles, as they serve no purpose.</p>
<p>(3) Do not burn tin foil. To suggest that tin foil is currency for ghosts is a great joke. It is useless. Therefore, I advocate not burning tin foil during ancestral worship to avoid unnecessary expenses.</p>
<p>(4) Replace dishes with fresh flowers and fruits, which are less expensive and more respectful and solemn.</p>
<p>(5) The chief celebrant should be solemn and respectful during ancestral worship, leading the family in recounting the history and achievements of the ancestors, so that future generations will have a lasting and profound impression of their ancestors.</p>
<p>I wonder what the members of this society think of the proposed improvements to ancestral worship. I hope everyone will discuss them.</p>
<h3 id="e250">My Thoughts on Improving Dining Practices <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Qixing</p>
<p>To avoid the spread of germs, shared dining should indeed be improved. However, switching to a system of individual servings of one soup and one dish may not suit our traditional appetites. Distributing food in a grid-like platter, like a fruit platter, would be inconvenient. Moreover, changing all bowls and basins to platter style would require notifying artisans nationwide, which is no easy task. For economically disadvantaged families, this is even more unattainable.</p>
<p>Now, in my humble opinion, a compromise between shared and individual dining could avoid financial losses and achieve satisfactory results. Each person could prepare one or two extra bowls and spoons. They could then use their own spoon to serve a portion of the shared dishes into their own bowl. More of the dishes they particularly like could be served. They could then use another spoon to eat. The remaining dishes would stay in the middle of the table, and more could be served later if desired. This would prevent the spread of germs without wasting money. Each family would only need a few extra bowls and spoons. As for the style, why must we copy Western styles? As long as it is practical, we can create our own style. (Respectful dismissal)</p>

<h3 id="e251">The Bedbug Revolution <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, while sleeping in bed, I had a dream. In my dream, a swarm of bedbugs crawled out from the walls, parading and demonstrating on my fleshy mountain. A bedbug, Bedbug A, stood on the tip of my nose and addressed the crowd, seemingly saying:</p>
<p>(Friends, rise up quickly! Last night, I took a bite of human blood. By daybreak, he sprayed me with "Flytox" and burned me with a candle. As a result, more than fifty or sixty of our comrades died. This is outrageous! Are humans so cruel? We must take revenge! We are the blood-sucking party, created by God. If we want to survive, we must strive hard and unite with mosquitoes, fleas, lice, and flies to resist humans.</p>
<p>We are the weaklings of all creatures. We have no other desires besides sucking a mouthful of blood. Humans, on the other hand, are not only terrifying eating parties but also have other insatiable desires besides eating. They refuse our meager nightly requests and want to eliminate us and drive us out. We have been oppressed by humans for thousands of years!)</p>
<p>I felt something crawling on my body, but I was still dreaming. Bedbug B, hearing Bedbug A's speech, eagerly climbed onto my left arm, continuing the speech.</p>
<p>(According to the teachings of Sakyamuni, all creatures should be equal. Therefore, his disciples, the monks, are the most loving. We often suck their blood, but they never complain or resort to killing. However, we cannot just suck their blood because the monks are easy to bully. We should launch a general attack on our abusive enemies!)</p>
<p>(Friends, rise up quickly! For the survival of our species, let us start the blood-sucking party revolution!)</p>
<p>After Bedbug B finished speaking, the crowd applauded. One of the largest and reddest bedbugs, walking unsteadily, climbed onto my shoulder and shouted to other species:</p>
<p>(Mosquitoes, fleas, lice, and flies! Rise up together and bring cholera, plague, and other infectious diseases to the humans. Use them as weapons to declare war on them! Because we are the weaklings of all creatures, we must unite to maintain the status of the blood-sucking party!)</p>
<p>I felt extremely itchy and could not bear to be disturbed any longer. I woke up from the dream. I wondered how I could have such a strange dream. It was not yet dawn. I turned on the electric light, rubbed my eyes, and looked around like a detective. Something was wrong! My whole body was covered with lumps, swollen unevenly, like steamed corn. Red blood-sucking parties were parading on the walls in formation. Furthermore, mosquitoes were playing victory music, extending their bayonets, and charging at me. Fleas and flies were working together, issuing general mobilization orders. I had no choice but to escape that room and let them have their revolution.</p>
<p>Notice to Su Fang: I have read your letter, and the planned project is quite appropriate. However, there are still points to consider. Please come to the library at 3 or 4 PM today or tomorrow to discuss everything in person. Otherwise, I will reply in the newspaper.</p>
