<h3>國聯幕後接洽</h3>
<p>美參加及否認僞組織趨勢</p>
<p>松岡與麥唐納赫禮歐會見</p>
<p>中日爭案移交大會理由</p>
<p>（日内瓦）英相麥唐納與美·法·意·德代表間之軍縮談話、雖暫將中日問題擱置、但注意此問題之小國間及國聯秘書處間、幕後頗形活動、小國所關心者、爲美國參加問題及有承認「滿洲國」决議案問題、不數國以爲大會不宜通過任何决議案、儘可將此事完全委諸十九委員會辦理、因此舉最足獲得美國之同情、蓋以美國自身正兩頭落空、寗願見國聯能有較爲自由之處理也、但同時其他方面、則主張通過不承認「滿洲國」之决議案、庶使國聯得與美國態度、趨於一致、前途趨勢大抵如此、</p>
<p>關於美國參加一層、有人建議、大會可授權十九委員會、推選同等地位而不註明國藉之其他委員、日本對於此事之態度、至堪注意、蓋日本去年曾根據手續理由、反對美國參加也、但衆信日本可望改變其對於調解委員會參加之態度、因日本自身、現準備於被請時、參加委員會議、設中日方面不起反對、則美國之參加、自不發生困難、（路透二日電）</p>
<h3>顧代表再函國聯駁覆松岡說帖歷叙日本不安情况</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）我國代表顧維鈞今日又以長函致國聯、駁擾日代表松岡之聲明書、歷叙日本在軍人統治下之不安情况、並追述日本昔日排外行爲之激烈、逈非今日中國所採之合理的經濟自衛方法所可比擬云、（三日中央社電）</p>
<h3>松岡拉攏大國與美英法要人會見</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）松岡代表今日與英國首相麥唐納及法國首相赫禮歐會見、爲確立英法二大國對中日問題之根本策、說明日本至布背水障之理由與情形、而請求諒解、確悉英法兩首相因軍縮會議告終後、尙有事必須返國、故雖出席特别大會、亦僅一二次、其後即由西門與彭古代表一切、英首相麥唐納與法首相赫體歐於與松岡代表會見後、即與西門與彭古各加討論、似在决定該問題之英法兩國態度、赫禮歐首相在巴黎與松岡代表會見後、據傳兩者之間、已成立諒解、如是則依預測、其後之大會當無大事、而一切皆在移交十九國委員會之後也、（電通社二日電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日松岡代表之出度十九國委員會之資格、僅在說明者、無積極的提案與其他發言之權限較理事會稍嫌不自由、然日代表部並不重視、緣日方之主張、在大會本會議一般討論之始與終之二次、已充分聲明、其後雖臨何項會議、祇在補足該理解不充分之點、無爲何項行動之必要、故據迄今之情形、十九國委員會自身、發見日本所能承認之解决案、如非常困難、實際上與此並行之大國間私的會談、實握解决之關鍵也、（電通社二日電）</p>
<p>（東京）日軍縮代表松平恒雄、昨日下午七時半訪美國代表台維斯、磋商軍縮問題、表示日本有新提案、新提案宗旨在尊重各國現有勢力及其特别環境、台維斯答云、各國所不能容納之案、則討論亦無補於事、松平再論及滿案、欲以軍縮牽制滿洲問題、美代表不睬、謂滿案已在國聯審議中、美國不願預先發表意見云、（華聯三日電）</p>
<p>（東京）據此間接日内瓦消息、松岡洋右因對於大會討論中日爭案時、德當局態度不能輕視、爲欲拉攏德代表在大會中支持日方主張起見、特於一日下午、急赴柏林訪德代表、請其諒解日方立場、並晤德當局各要人後、始於昨晚六時回抵日内瓦云、（遠東社三日電）</p>
<p>據東報載、從可靠方面探悉、在日内瓦之日代表松岡洋右、於其最近與軍縮大會美代表台維司氏會談中、曾作若干阻止日美關係變成惡化之提議、並允許彼將於國聯議會大會終了後訪問美國、以期取得關於中日爭端之美國方面之諒解、又探悉台維司氏表示其私人意見、謂布望日本盡其力之所能、避免在日内瓦與列强之正面衝突、而用一種建設的計畫、以成就一種調和的解决、松岡氏就台維司之所言、獲得一印象、覺台氏暗示宜使中國對於滿洲國保留一種宗主權、同時表示美國不欲在國聯方面多所表見、松岡與台維司之談話、被視爲甚爲重要、又堪注意者、日美間關於滿洲問題之討論、將於國聯行政院會議終了後、在美國舉行之云、（世界社）</p>
<h3>日方重視調委會之組織主張職權須加以制限</h3>
<p>（東京）此間官塲對於國聯特别大會、擬組織中日問題調解委員會一說、現予以嚴重注意、此間人士以爲如調解委員會不加入爭議中之兩造、則其結果、恐將成加諸中日之不負責任的解决、如加入中日代表、則第三方面之干涉、或將妨碍根據中日談判之解决、日本官塲主張調解委員會之職權、須加以限制、日内瓦現唱不承認「滿洲國」及延不解决滿洲問題之說、以爲日本因此將陷於財政僵局、而日本穩健派或將抬頭、强迫日本對國聯讓步、要知抱此期望者、終必失望也云、（路透二日電）</p>
<p>（東京）衆院議員今晨在議長公署集議、一致通過决議案、即以議長秋田之名義、電達日内瓦日代表松岡、表示衆院對日内瓦日代表團勞績之感忱、並切望日代表加倍努力、使國聯會員體諒日本之主張、並遵守日本所定對「滿洲國」政策行事、（路透三日電）</p>
<h3>解决期限問題希孟函顏代表</h3>
<p>申明未能遽予規定之理由日内瓦注意義軍戰况</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九委員會主席希孟、對於規定討論中日爭議之期限事、致函顏惠慶博士希孟於函中聲稱、特委會深知顏博士請求規定限期之重要、惟覺在未悉國聯大會意見時、特委會未能遽即研究解决此種與延長期限問題有關係之事件、故非至大會討論結束後、特委會未能開始研究此案解决之可能辦法、以及决定期限問題云、一般人現甚注意滿洲方面戰事之進行、日軍不以被拘爲質之日人生命爲念、而進攻滿洲境内之中國義勇軍消息、今日引起中國發言人聲明云、國中義勇軍對於戰區内之日本平民、予以人道的待遇、如十月三十日滿洲里日人一百二十一名之釋放、及十一月二十一日海拉爾日僑三十八名之護送出境、皆其例也、（路透社二日電）</p>
<h3>移交大會理由</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯中人恐外間對於國聯大會與行政院二機關、處理中日爭執之職權、發生誤解、特向記者說明、此次各理事授權行政院、將李頓報告書移交國聯大會、一如李頓調查團初步報告辦法、不則理事至多亦祇可評論該報告、因中日爭執旣經移交大會、此時理事會不家再有所建議、或於解决方面採取任何行動、日前行政院主席凡勒拉聲明、行政院經通過相當决議案後、仍可再行提出李頓報告云云、其意義即僅指討論而言、蓋李頓調查團雖係行政院根據國聯盟約第十一欵派遣赴滿、而其調查報告亦以該欵爲根據、但自調查團出發以後、中國又提出盟約第十欵及第十五欵、將中日爭執移交國聯大會、日本雖抗辯、輙經得政院否决、宣稱此案之任何一造、皆有充分理由提出第十五欵、請國聯大會處理、其後國聯大會亦於三月二日决議案内明白宣稱、此項構成中國政府聲請目的之全部爭執、已移交國聯大會、並請行政院供給各種認爲有價値之意見與文件、故此案應歸國聯大會解决、而李頓報告應即移交大會也、（國民社二日電）</p>
<h3>又是一套把戲傀儡政府之傀儡電文</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表團將「滿洲國」外長及所謂滿洲民衆團體、對於李頓報告書發表意見之來電、抄送國聯大大會、「滿洲國」外長電稱、滿政府接滿洲民衆呈文三千餘件、覲此可見「滿洲國」得多數人民之贊助、彼等鑒於行政之漸有起色、故深信前途之光明、自新邦成立以來、從前弊政掃除凈盡、厲行法治政府、已將軍費較前减至三分之一、秩序漸復、李頓報告書反對「滿洲國」之數節、基於偏見、與事實不符、「滿洲國」人民絕對不能贊成李頓報告書之意見、報告書之建議、不能植立和平、徒增紛擾、凡變更現有事態、或妨碍「滿洲國」獨立與進步之任何計畫、「滿洲國」人民堅决反對之、察李頓報告書、顯見調查團未入滿洲時、已預有解决成見、調查團在滿時、不採行積極方法以調查民意、但接收來源可疑之函件千起、調查團以此爲根據、遽作胆大草率之斷語、「滿洲國」人民至爲僨懣云云、（路透社三日電）</p>
<h3>叛逆代表分頭活動</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）叛逆丁士源二日到日内瓦、（中央社二日電）</p>
<p>（東京）僞代表鮑　澄因國聯形勢對日不利、於僞組織存亡有關、傀儡地位有被推翻之危險、故今日招請在東京各外國通信社記者、極力傾訴、所發表内容、恰與日外部所述完全一様、故各國記者均不理會云、（華聯二日電）</p>

<h3>何以爲外交之後盾乎都良</h3>
<p>舉世屬目之國聯特會。已决定於十二月六日召。集而以十九國委員會辦理自行政院移轉大會之過渡手續屆時會議席上。必有一番劇烈雄偉之辯論戰兩當事國之舌矛脣戟固不待言。即在一般小國代表平日對侵略國所積貯不發之義憤。至是亦得有盡量披洩之機會。爲正義公道謀相當之擁護。爲國聯本身保垂隳之威信。日内瓦方面空氣之緊張。蓋可想見。　　日人明知過度侵略之不復見諒於列强。明知一般小國决無對己之好感。明知累積之蠻柄態度。已不能復藉普通掩飾之工具以自解釋。遂不惜一意蠻幹。潰决到底。對内則積極準備戰事。以激剌彼國國民之情緒。對外則採取特殊手腕。以淆惑國際之視聽。故一方宜稱脫退國聯。以恫嚇列强。一方竭力拉攏小國。以曲求諒解。一方盡情詆毀吾國内政之不修。一方散放中日直接交涉之空氣。其布置之周密心術之機詐重重烟幕之下。有遠非常人想像所能及者。吾人以宰割之餘痛。冀正義之伸張。壇坫之上。詞直氣壯。顏顧郭三代表雍容準備。以逸待勞。宜勿煩吾人遠爲顧慮。惟將以何道間執誣蔑之藉口如何而使三代表發言更有充分之力量。是則有待於國内上下一致之努力矣。</p>
<p>所謂努力者何。曰迅弭内戰力謀團結而已。夫以一國軍人。當異族侵入之際。不爲禦侮之計轉爲鬩牆之爭。此爲若何可恥之事。當外交形勢之嚴重如今日。而猶不知謀一致之步調。則其事爲更可恥。彼日人方以非國家誣我。其意無非欲爲違犯公約行爲之一種解嘲的口實耳。我國軍人逢到如此嚴重情勢。而猶兵連不解不亦太爲毀我者所笑。而授出度國聯之三代表以甚難國護之障壁乎。</p>
<p>抑吾人今日之謀團結。猶不僅爲外交上求整齊之步調。亦爲軍事上立基本之壁壘。世未有内部分崩離析。而可以謀對外之長期抵抗者。亦未有操戈同室而可以覓外交上勝利之途徑者。内爭旣息。團結已成。夫然後外交代表。乃得縱横自如以發揮論爭。而長期抵抗之初期準備。亦可於此焉開其端。淞滬戰事之怱怱結束日兵之所以能如期撤退。固有其他種種之原由。要以爾日十九路軍之沉著應戰。全國視線集中一隅。有使日人不能不急遽撤去目標者。據諳悉日軍内幕者言。日人第一著祇欲在滬示威以分散我國人十對東北之注意力。初不虞駐軍之遽予抵抗。轉以形成我國團結之局面。故其和二著即在怱怱結束滬戰。以傾注其力於東北。而靜觀我國内部之交閧。奈何我國武人。一味　預。竟墮其術。淞滬之土血未乾。而内亂遽以爆發乎。日代表長岡春一由國聯播音台播音。謂日本大陸政策之所以屢占勝著。實爲國民一心一德援助所致。而東京婦女協會聯合會以二百萬會員之力量。通過議案。亦謂内憂外患交迫之際。應團結一致爲國盡。力彼爲侵略之主動者。而其國内猶以團結相鞭策。而謂我受人陵逼之國家。反可煑豆燃箕自促滅亡乎。昔當西曆紀元以前。希臘國在城邦制度之下。形成渙散之局顧於波斯大軍壓境之際。卒能團結一致。内挽厄運。外抗强隣。薩力米司一役。雅典艦隊之威望。足以洒雪斯巴達王戰死之恥辱而有餘。以立國二十世紀之我華。獨不能興團結之意念以捍衛其邦家乎。</p>
<p>明乎此。則團結之交已見。吾人與其髮指眦裂於日人誣蔑之横加。毌寗急速消弭亂象。以塞彼悠悠者之口。與其瞻回咨嗟於外交情勢之嚴重。曷如明白打開隔閡以共謀一致之發展。遠徵史乘。近察國情。舍團結一致外。尙有何術足以自存。被川黔軍人。其猶有一絲天良未泯者。悔禍改圖。此其時矣。</p>

<p>國民社二日華盛頓電　今日美總統胡佛與國務卿史汀生及財長米爾士第二次會商戰債問題、歷時甚久、會議旣畢、史汀生返國務院時、新聞記者叩以美國復文何時可以草成、史氏即答稱、未必有答復之必要、又謂會商尙無結果、按國際慣例、友邦來牒必須答復、今史氏聲稱英法來牒未必有答復之必要又僅此一語、未加詮釋、因此外間頓起種種揣測與謠傳、有謂國務院殆必續接英法大使署非正式之文件者、亦有謂總統顯正與國務卿及財長討論某種解决方法、决定至少再繼續會商一日者、據接近政府者稱、明日爲星期六、物品及證劵市塲僅業半日、美政府態度雖不能即時决定、當可不致再起大影響、惟今日各項市場無一不跌價、則純因戰債問題不定而起、足見此事之嚴重、</p>
<h3>胡佛總統躊躇莫决</h3>
<p>國民二日華盛頓電　據可靠消息、美總統此時對於戰債、顯似仍在躊躇不决之中、聞將於下星期内向國會特别報告蓋總統認此事極爲重要、故不復在普通報告内、與其他經濟問題同時論列、將另作一特報告、詳述政府主張、至别組委員會處理戰債之原議、聞已失去光輝矣、頃官塲已承認財長米爾士或能在十二月十五日以前、宣告戰債協定内九十日前通知一節、暫予通融、允英法及其他債務國緩付本金、但息金仍須照付云、</p>
<h3>波拉認英牒有理由</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯二日華盛頓電　參議院外交委員會主席波拉、以爲戰債之逕行取銷或减少、皆不足以改善世界經濟狀况又云、「關於世界經濟狀况、余意見與英國牒文完全相同、英牒謂種種足以减少信任心之原因、一日存在、則世界各國即一日不能作振興商業之想、不惟不能振興商務、即欲設法使商務結構之軍用恢復常態亦不可得、此意余亦深以爲然、第戰債問題、雖與减少信任心極有關係、究非惟一原因、英牒叙述世界凋蔽之可怖狀態、備極詳盡、欲圖挽救、斷非任何姑息手段或缺乏實效之計畫所能濟事」云云、</p>
<h3>洋瓶石塊敵不過流淚彈</h3>
<p>美飢民與警察起衝突</p>
<p>國民社二日威明頓（第勒事爾州）電　飢民請願隊與警察今夜在此間發生第一次衝突、飢民舉行會議、警察勒令解散、飢民不從、警察欲用武力、忽有洋瓶石子自人叢擲出、警察遂召援隊、以流淚彈進攻、立將飢民驅散、若輩約有一千二百人、欲待西部飢民請願隊開到後、於星期一清晨同入華盛頓、今旣發生衝突、其首領已自揣此後恐將難於整隊入京、惟有各個單獨混入京城、然後集合、若輩大多數尙能守秩序、惟少數不肖份子旣發生紛擾、遂亦無法避免衝突、</p>
<h3>國會不變强硬態度</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯二日華盛頓電　接近公府人士謂、胡佛總統似已承認英國覆文所提理由極爲有力、但參議員多人則聲明决不改變宗旨、彼等聞總統見地如此、故對渠亦採敵對態度、天與其仇視英國無異、此間政界人士以爲歐洲債務國之所以堅持緩付債務者、實由胡佛總統暗中鼓勵所致、胡佛甚或與債務國文書往來、有所允許、而爲美國國會所不知、亦莫須有之事云、</p>
<p>民國二日華盛頓電　衆議院長茄納稱、余雖知國會將不允緩付戰債、就余判斷、亦認美國堅持付欵後、各方面較能有益、茄氏此語、咸認可以代表國會内大多數意見、足徵兩院議員對戰債態度、仍未變於前、第觀於波拉之言、則國會中亦未　無主張讓步者、但人數不多耳、</p>
<h3>英施報復於已無益</h3>
<p>美參議員之警告</p>
<p>路透社二日華盛頓電　美國會方面今日對於戰債之緩付、發嚴厲之言論、參議員史摩特稱、如英國於付債後對於美國貿易加以稅率上之限制、則依渠意思、受害者不爲美國、但爲英國本身云、參議員哈利遜稱、英國侈言禍患之可能性、英國所暗示積極管理匯兌或增加報復討畫之恫嚇、不能變更美國反對戰債取銷或展緩之沉靜判定云、</p>
<h3>賴債乃不榮譽事</h3>
<p>羅斯福之表示</p>
<p>路透二日華盛頓電　國務卿史汀生與財長米爾斯在白宮會商數小時後、出語人曰、吾人尙未决定第二涉辦法云、衆料胡佛總統致國會之詞、將爲致英法之覆文、美國報紙皆甚注意英國來牒、惟知如國會不變態度、則終無可爲也、基督敎科學報之方曰、吾人終將以可悲的景象買諸世界云、紐約時報華盛頓讠電稱、胡佛總統左右鑒於英牒、大爲感動、某要人稱、如當局果有憲法職　與政治勢力則英國定可勝利云、講壇報稱、英牒可視爲對輿論而發、而輿情之反應、必須於靜默中待之云、被選總統羅斯福在大同報登載一文、謂債欵必須償付、凡有穩健常議者、當在各方面上扶助債務國、但若取銷債欵則旣不可行、亦不榮譽云、</p>

<h3>英美法要人集日内瓦重開軍縮談判</h3>
<p>美代代表希望會議作一初步結束</p>
<p>建議根據已成立之原則繕成公約</p>
<p>由全體代表簽字另設小組草細則</p>
<p>徇從德國均等要求</p>
<p>擬成所謂居間計劃</p>
<p>國民社三日日内瓦電　英法兩總揆今晨私人談話後、繼以英相與意代表阿樂雪之晤談、聞今日下午三人將再與美代表台維斯討論軍縮問題、赫禮歐現擬下星期二離日内瓦、麥唐納則可望多留數日、</p>
<p>國民社三日日内瓦電　法總理赫禮歐已於今晨抵此、上午將與英首相麥唐納外相西門會談、徇從德國軍備均等要求之所謂居間計畫、㈠准德國縮短目下軍隊之在伍期限、㈡此項軍隊得依照新時代之標準重行編制、㈢設立保安團保護邊界、維持國内治安、同時德允在軍縮新公約簽字後、五年内不增加陸海軍預算、聞德·意·英三國已贊成此項計畫、惟法國之態度今仍未明、如麥唐納與台維斯力能勸法國亦予贊同、則可保德國重返軍縮會議及會議之成功、此事大約須待下星期初德外長牛賴資到此後始有决議、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二日日日内瓦電　軍縮會議重開以前、各方關於政治上之談話、已於今日開始進行、惟吾人所知者、僅英首相麥唐納午前與美代表台維斯會晤、午後與法代表彭古接洽而已、據參加軍縮會議美國人士之意見、美國代表之意向、在於急謀一種具體結果、外間謂其希望軍縮失敗之說、殊非眞相、美代表方面、以爲軍縮會議、已屆訂立初步公約之時期、因軍縮會議、業已通過者若干原則、各大國大可因之而促進此項公約也、至於七月二十三日軍縮會議所採之决議案、似嫌不足、各方或可即時同意先草擬一種範圍有限性質重要之條約草案、而目前不急求軍縮及安全問題之全部解决、美國人士希望在聖誕節以前、或可得到初步結果、</p>
<p>路透二日日内瓦電　此間美國發言人今日稱、一般人以爲幂縮會成績缺乏、漸覺厭倦、美國爲興奮事情起見、已建議將軍縮會在其九個月集會中所議定之辦法、併列於一種公約中、由出席日内瓦之六十國全體簽字、至於此約之適用、及詳則之完成、不妨交常設監察委員會辦理之云、英相麥唐納今日已與美代表台維斯·法代表彭古發起五强國之談話、將决定軍縮會應否採用美國計畫、抑或進行規模更大之程序、</p>
<h3>德新閣員名單施萊轍總揆兼長國防</h3>
<p>有擬以副揆一席畀希特勒說</p>
<p>國民社三日柏林電　新總理施萊轍將軍今午已將内閣名單呈送總統、内容尙未正式發表、據聞施自兼國防及普魯士行政委員、克洛雪克伯爵仍長財政、魯平那黑男爵仍長交通、古爾納博士長司法、卜畢茲博士以不管部閣員代理普魯士行政委員、正午後舊内閣即舉行會議、繼以留任各部長之非正式會議、逆料新閣將於今日下午宣誓成立、然後立即考慮與外長牛賴資赴日内瓦有關之急要問題、</p>
<p>國民社二日柏林電　德國新總理施萊轍將軍、現年五十歲、出身於德國最老家庭之一、世代以軍功著稱、故施氏於十七歲即入軍隊、擢陞極速、至四十六歲即已至將軍之位、此在德國歷史上尙屬年事最輕之將軍也、施氏當歐戰時、服務於參謀部直轄之鐵道部、戰後加入國防軍、不久即爲國防部長格龍納氏最信任之人、及白魯寗内閣辭職、施氏即被任爲國防部長、蓋已深得興登堡總統之畀倚、施氏在巴本内閣中雖位居國防主任、但其實際地位之重要、確超乎其名位、蓋斯時國家社會派聲勢磅礴、時欲以暴力攫取政權、施將軍對之毫不示弱、而希特勒之素志亦終難逞云、</p>
<p>路透社二日柏林電　新總理施萊轍現從事組織新閣、施氏擬抛棄前總理巴本所定修改憲法之計劃、並取銷社會黨所反對之减少工資令、此種避免國會衝突之氣象、衆認爲良好、而視施氏爲德國政治中之怪傑、新總理將以德國銀行路德博士之襄助、繕就關於經濟與失業之程序、衆料此種程序、可爲各方面所同意、施氏並極力拉攏國社黨希特勒、或將畀以副總理一席、聞施氏之任總理、非與登堡總統之所顧、總統仍欲以巴本執政‘但巴本知原有閣員間有不願再入其新閣者、故辭不就職、而舉施氏以代、以其較可與國會融洽也、新政府將於星期二日與國會相見、屆時國會或將延會一星期、以便黨魁之談判、</p>
<h3>印度圓桌會討論國防問題</h3>
<p>總督負有管理特權</p>
<p>歐温言論遭受抨擊</p>
<p>路透二日倫敦電　印度圓桌會議已解决選舉權等之憲法上問題、其第二星期之考慮、大都由中央政府担負責任起至自治完成止、過渡時期中之保障辦法、前印督歐温表示英政府之意見、謂總督除管理國防與對外關係外、應有權設法以維持安寗、保護少數民族、並保護印度諸邦權利、與對英帝國其他部份之關係、印度事務大臣賀爾於辯論三日後、代表政府說明此種特權、應有限制而實施之、庶免妨及責任、會衆對於保護英帝國關係一層、頗多抨擊、賀爾聲稱、此非謂總督得於平時在印度政府與其他自治地政府間有所干涉、但所謂保護者、僅於關係緊張危及帝國政府之完整時始用之、今旣有人反對、渠當重加研究云、賀爾最後作樂觀語、謂現較初開會時更有希望云、</p>
<h3>收回油權波斯舉國稱慶</h3>
<p>俄報譽之爲勇敢行爲</p>
<p>路透社二日德黑蘭電　波斯政府取銷達西油礦讓與權、今日已由國會贊同、城中現仍慶祝此舉、各商店皆張燈結綵、民衆結隊乘車過市、沿途歡歌、各劇場槪不收費、波斯其他各城得此消息、亦舉行慶祝、英波油公司宣稱、現正草擬報告、擬上諸股東、日内即將發表、按波斯政府於十一月三十日宣布取銷此項讓與權、因此爲波斯有立憲政府以前所許給者、故其條欵應重加商訂、而英波油公司置諸不理之故、英當局現極注意此事、因英人執有英波油公司股份甚巨、且因其油乃供給英海軍需用故也、</p>
<p>塔斯社二日莫斯科電　蘇聯政府公報「伊士凡斯太」今日於社論中、稱波斯政府取銷英波油公司讓與權之舉、爲一重大之政治事件、該報略述波斯政府所反對該公司以特殊之會計法、減低紙面之嬴餘數、使波政府不能取得其協定中規定應得之部份、指此種手段、爲「帝國主義殖民地掠奪最險惡之一種」、又謂此問題之解决、當在法律方式之外、蓋此舉同爲一政治事件、英政府不僅將以其世界石油業中所佔之地位、且將舉帝國所有之政治軍事勢力、以凌波斯政府、是則波斯政府之收回油礦權、可稱爲一大勇之行爲也、該報結論謂「波斯政府之敢作此舉、亦因英帝國已在世界經濟恐慌下、失去其世界領導地位、不論將來交涉之結果如何、此舉顯示英國殖民地政策破裂之一徵兆、而其影響於東方國家、將更搖動英帝國之基礎也」云、</p>

<h3>漢奸于冲漢被暗殺</h3>
<p>被殺時在日兵嚴衛之下</p>
<p>兇手爲一僞官至今未獲</p>
<p>傀儡國混亂情形之一斑</p>
<p>世界社譯密勒評論報云日本傀儡「滿洲國」之内訌多端、及陰謀疊出、已於于冲漢（僞樞密院院長、）之被暗殺、而得其確證、關於此事、上海若干小報曾略提及、但此外在遠東未有詳情之宣布、關於此暗殺案之唯一紀載、顯然僅見之於十月二十四號之紐約泰晤士雜誌、SimeMagazine雖該雜誌所載之姓名並未凖確、而所記案情、則顯然不誤、因居住大連之密勒報之一讀者現已寄來一該案之同様報告也、泰晤士雜誌從何處得此消息、不得而知但其所紀該案發生所在之飯館之名、顯與犧牲者于冲漢之姓名相混、據該雜誌載于冲漢由日警愼重保衛、在長春日本鐵路區之一華人飯館内進餐、突有傀儡樞密院之另一官員名李毅生（LiYiSun譯音）者闖入、李氏似曾一度任黑龍江省民政長、後被罷免、該雜誌記載中又提及另一齊齊哈爾官員之名程志遠（ChenShieh_Yuen譯音按程氏任黑省僞代省長昨報載已被日軍第二師團長多門槍斃）者、據云彼係由于冲漢之陰謀而被免官者故本案究係何人主謀、未克明瞭、所可知者、爲一「滿洲國」之大員于冲漢氏服務於日本人之下者、被人暗殺、而暗殺者爲另一華人官員、此人迄今未遭拘捕、未被法律製裁也如前所述、當時于氏在日本衛兵擁護下就食於飯館中、另一華官闖入（奪取廚房中所用之屠刀、連所于氏之頭及頸部多處、其後于因傷重、於十一月一號死於大連这滿鐵醫院中、當時兇手見目的已達、即揚長走出該飯館、而入另一飯館進餐、日警察當局竟視若無覩、不加拘捕、至今逍遙法外焉、此案旣出、日當局立卽實施檢查新聞、故在滿洲及日本國内各報均未紀載此事、僅英文日本紀錄報（英人所辦、曾約略一載、亦未提及姓名、僅猜測兇手當受法律之處置而已、卽關於于氏在大連醫院逝世之消息、亦受檢查、故如日本電報美國聯合通信社傳出之電訊亦含混其詞、</p>
<p>于冲漢之被暗殺、及日人之不檢舉殺于之兇手、足供吾人對於傀儡京城現在情形如何之一種有興味之窺測、有一熟悉世界情事之外人近曾旅行於長春者聲稱、據彼看來、「滿洲國」首都之現狀、爲任何一國首都所未有、日人在世界宣傳「滿洲國」如何「鞏固」、實則適得其反、日人從不信任何人、凡華員之與日人同事者、卽有遵暗殺之險、當去年九一八瀋變發生之後助日人組織瀋陽治安維持會袁金鎧氏、曾告國聯調查團、謂彼處於被暗殺之危機中、常在日本軍採及憲兵之監視下、故于冲漢氏之暗殺案、益足以顯見「滿洲國」在日軍控制下之情形如何混亂而黑暗也、</p>

<h3>葉大康君訊廿一·十二·三。</h3>
<p>日昨張雲秋女士所提出的：㈠爲什麽這無數的夫妻竟會由愛情的沸點降落到零度？及㈡這様的悲劇有什麽方法可以補救？兩個問題，我認爲是非常之値得討論，因爲這現象實在是太普遍了。</p>
<p>這問題當然不是某一個人所能解答，但貴報旣將這問題提交大家討論，我也就可以在這裏貢獻我一點經騐和意見。</p>
<p>關於第一個問題，我認爲這是一個自然的趨勢，好比鐘錶裏面的發條，開緊之後，走了二十四個鐘頭，自然會鬆弛下來，這並不足奇怪。依此理論而求其補救之道，則發條鬆了，自然只有「再開幾把，」怎様開呢？伋我的經騐，一對夫婦假如時常小别離，格外可以增加情愛，俗話說得好；「新婚不如久别，」爲什麽新婚不如久别？這就是不讓發條一口氣走鬆和道理。所以我認爲補救之道，時常作小别離，至也不失爲一法。</p>
<h3>吳劍秋君訊廿一·十二·三。</h3>
<p>昨天張雲秋女士提出的兩個問題，我覺到大家都應該來參加討論。</p>
<p>我的意見是：㈠無數的夫妻由愛情的沸點降到零度這種現象是很尋常的，已經結婚甚至生了小孩子的夫婦，自然不能如初戀時代那様的濃得化不開。假使一對青年夫婦整天地「好哥哥」「好妹妹」難分難捨，扭股婚糖似的扭成一堆，又成什麽事體，不過由沸點到冰點，則也太可怕。至於補救的方法，我記得張伯苓先生曾說：「妻子如果能時常換一件新衣，也可以增加夫婦的情愛，」雖說張先生這只是一句隨便的笑話，但我覺得也不點道理，我就轉介紹張先生這個意見給大家參考試行能！</p>
<p>記者按：張女士所提出的兩個問題，確實是很値得討論。上　葉吳兩君的信，只是一種「意見，」並不是「結論，」希望天下的善男信女們，都踴躍發抒高見，這並不是爲别人，也就是爲你們自己。</p>
<h3>劉覺君來訊廿一·十二·三</h3>

<p>短篇小說</p>
<h3>新婚之夜（三）</h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>其實這還沒有什麽大的關係，最令秀姑娘受打擊的是她母親生最小的妹妹底時候，費了一天兩夜的功夫，孩子仍然沒有下地，而她從門縫中親眼看見母親痛得打滾，大聲呌喊，哭得眼淚雙流的種種情形，只是一陣陣打着冷戰：尤其令她害怕的是聽說這次小孩下來先足後頭，這的確太危險了。誰聽到了也會吐舌的。秀姑娘更不用說；她的害怕，和對於生小孩的反感简直不能以筆墨形容，從此她下了一世不嫁人的决心，祇是日夜做着她獨身的美夢。</p>
<p>的確太奇怪了，誰也料想不到僅僅半年的功夫她會嫁給一個四十八歲，身材矮小，皮膚黃黑，起着無數縐紋，臉部完全像猴子模様的老丈夫。在别人自然不了解秀姑娘的苦痛，只是覺得「鮮花挿在牛糞上」（註三）有點可惜而已，然而她的父母除了感到榮耀幸福而外，简直絲毫不滿意的地方都沒有。這固然因了女婿是個獨生子，而家產又是小康之家，加以子婿别勤儉而且錢會賺錢，將來說不定還可成爲一個富翁，這都是等於女兒的財產，將來一生受用都是她的。做父母的責任就在把女兒嫁掉，能夠還二個有家當的女婿，這在他們看來更是個慈善的模範父親了。雖然女婿的年齡與女兒相差三十二歲，但究竟媒人的面子太大了，不好推脫，而且這有什麽關係呢？男子是應該比女人大的。</p>
<p>「秀兒的婚事好雖然好，只是我覺得那人的年紀太大了一點，不相配的。」　　有天秀姑娘的母親這様感慨地說。　　「有什麽不相配，他年紀大一點正好招呼她，俗話說「老年討親當個寳，少年討親當根草」（註四）而且即使他將來發了財，也不會耽心他再娶小老婆了，你說對不對？」</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛，屬你想得這麽遠，大一」</p>
<p>兩歲還不要虑，三十二歲，實在相差太遠了，你想目前的生活她怎能過得上去呢？」</p>
<p>究竟是慈母的心腸，說宪她居然流起淚來了。</p>
<p>一笑話，有什麽可哭的呢？又不是送她到老虎嘴裏去。莫說他還炽有四十八歲，即使五十八，六十八，又有什麽關係呢？你不知道王家冲那個福老爺七十五了還要娶個十四歲的小姑娘做小老婆嗎？那女孩子還不是一様的人！」</p>
<p>秀姑娘的父親本來是一個和善的人，但不知爲什麽近來爲了女兒的婚事總是和妻子吵架，而且每次說不上兩句就大發其氣，今天又是一様，不但說話的態度不好，而且語氣也持别尖刻，這大約因爲剛才喝了酒的關係。</p>
<p>「那是不應該的，喪德的呵！」</p>
<p>停了很久，秀姑娘的母親這様胆怯怯地又像是反抗地說了這聲。</p>
<p>「有什麽喪德，又不是殺了她煑來下酒。」</p>
<p>「哼！比殺她還可怕！」</p>
<p>「你看吧，將來秀兒嫁到那邊去，只要一圓房，包你什麽問題都沒有了。」</p>
<p>「哼！你也看吧！」</p>
<h3>怒</h3>
<p>笑一陣，哭一陣，無拘無束，無牽無掛，算我自在。但看看眼前，想想過去，忽然心血來潮，又深覺得啼笑都不是，便馬上停笑止哭，掀動起萬丈無名的怒火來。</p>
<p>怒，多麽難看！滿臉通紅，眉縱眼横，磨拳擦掌，兇兇然，好比活魔王出世，自然沒有謙遜那麽文雅而温柔，那麽和平而好看。</p>
<p>但謙遜也得有個分寸。假如你家裏，今知有人來打刦，明天又有人來强姦，弄得食不安，寢不安，你也文雅而温柔地，和平而好看地，作個揖，鞠個躬，甚至叩三個響頭，『諸位好漢，小生在這廂有禮』，天下果有是理乎？我則不能！</p>
<p>就是我們祖宗，雖說從來是住在禮義之邦，但也並不是不「怒」。你看：「怒髮衝冠」，是何等的威風！」呌斷灞流」，又是何等的嚇人？至於「一怒而諸侯懼」，「一怒而安天下之民」，那更是深關乎天下安危，可以奉做怒的典型。所以，就是我們偶然動點火，雖說不免有些難看，但究無傷大雅，而且也决不會就成爲不肖之子孫。</p>
<p>不過怒也要怒得恰當，不應該無理取鬧，更不應該口硬心虚。張老二兄弟一句話不對頭，便馬上紅起眼睛來打架，這便呌做無理取鬧；王大娘被盜刦，嚇得躱在棉被裏不敢出氣，等到强盜走了，却哭哭啼啼在大門口指天劃地的駡殺千刀，這便呌做口哽心虚。</p>
<p>然而眼前我們貴國的張老二，王大娘之流實在太多了，嗚呼噫嘻，『一怒而安天下之民』，斯怒不出，如國家何？</p>
<h3>兒童的王國</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>「英國是兒童的王國。」日本鶴見佑輔曾經這様說過。</p>
<p>眞的，英國的一切社會生活，都是以兒童爲中心的。假如我們走到倫敦的書店裏面去，那末我們便可發見堆積成山的兒童讀物在那裏陳列着。童話亦以英國爲多，可以說除了安徒生一人以外，許多童話都出自英國。</p>
<p>普通一般的倫敦人，對於兒童都非常愛護。在保存人種的一點上，他們對於小孩的人格十分尊敬。即在貧窮的家庭裏面，也會有一個兒童房間。這一個房間乃是一神聖的區域，兒童成爲眞正的主權者。當然。那裏便是兒音的王國。大人走入這個王國裏面，須十分尊敬和嚴肅。</p>
<p>倫敦的家庭，大半都有一個小小的庭園，同時鋼琴或綱球場的設備也是不會缺少的。又因爲倫敦老是烟霧迷濛，妨害了兒童的身體發育，於是許多人便想移居郊外，使兒童儘其何能的接近自然。這當然是愛護兒童的心理之反映。</p>
<p>英國兒童的母親，爲着使子女成爲英國民族的繼存者起見，都不辭辛苦使子女鍜綀於風霜寒暑之中，希望他們在南極的冰島之上，樹立起大英帝國的旗幟。因此母子之間常有一種尊敬心，但也許即是一種隔閡：結果便形成了兩個人格的對立。</p>
<h3>現在德國婦女的地位</h3>
<p>— 劍</p>
<p>講到德國婦女，那眞使人驚服。她們美有法國女子的勇敢精神和堅苦耐勞的毅力，然而她們却比法國女子來得　素。她們在歡戰後總算得到了參政權，但她們曾經許多奮鬥，决不是隨隨便便得來的。不論什麽國家的婦女運動，都是以提高婦女的地位和創造婦女的新環境爲主要目的，德國婦女運動當然不能例外。</p>
<p>一九○八年，因還運動的結果，德國各大學都聞放了，婦女均可自由進大學聽講，不像從前須受限　；同時祇要女子有技能，可在不論那項戰業至佔着較高的位置。這個特期可以說是德國婦女運動的第一個階段。不過德國婦女地位的急激變化道是歐戰時的事情。那時男子無論老的少的都上火綫作戰去了。剩下的祇是些婦女，究竟她們作什麽工作好呢？對於什麽工作有興味呢？在這緊急的當兒，她們己再沒有顧慮的餘地，於是她們勇敢地取一切男子的位置而代之，就是製造軍用品，駕汽車以至其他極笨重的工作，她們都能操作自如，简直和男子一様，從此不但打破了由來輕視婦女的積習，而且替婦女界造成了一頁極光榮的歷史。這是德國婦女運動的第二階段。</p>
<p>歐戰停止了，一班退伍兵士由前綫回來了，他們都希望婦女們退歸家庭，把位子讓出來。可是她們旣有過職衆的嘗試，且有相當成效，同時又感到工作的興趣，無論如何不甘僅僅雌伏於家庭；尤其是一班智識階級和閒散階級的婦女，更不願像從前一様整年在家裏過那枯燥無聊的生活，所以她們要求職業的心情更爲熱烈。此外因爲五十二個月戰爭的結果，全德國的人民都陷於破產的境域，一班寡婦孤女却不得不找尋職業，維持她們的生存；同時有一大半男子在沙場爲國捐軀，結果女子超過男子將近三百萬，因而發生了女子結婚的困難問題。女子旣找不到配偶，但她們却不得不生活，所以在工作方面平添了許多娘子軍。根據事實的證明，德國婦女不僅能夠担任一切事務，而且能夠與男子共同担負國民經濟復興的責任。就是在行政方面，她們也具有相當能力。到了這個時期，大家已漸漸承認婦女參政的可能性了。然而大部份人對此仍持冷淡態度，且以爲女子的職務只在處理家務，實無參政的必要。因此婦女參政運動便加倍熱烈起來，結果，德國議會卒於一九一八年通過給與婦人參政權的决議案，翌年德國憲法上並明白列入婦女有選舉權及被選舉權之規定。這是歐戰後德國婦女地位變遷的梗槪慨。</p>
<h3>初冬之街頭</h3>
<p>— 星子</p>
<p>寒風趕走了還帶有一絲絲温和意味的秋，送來了更深重的冷意，這時候又已臨到使窮人們着慌的初冬了！　　初冬的街頭，整天是特别的熱鬧，但在另一面，却也是特别的蕭瑟。狂歡裏夾雜着哭泣，香檳酒杯裏滲着血與淚，這正是作成近代都市的基礎，也正是近代都市裏所萬不可缺少的交響曲。</p>
<p>咱們就以南京路爲例罷：</p>
<p>鼓樂聲叮噹於兩側，大布幡飄搖乎路中，而一到夜裏，紅的綠的電炬，更使人目光爲之撩亂，心神爲之飄蕩。這是初冬應時的呌賣。大百貨公司的玻璃窗裏，掛滿了狐的腿，貂的皮，温暖細緻的巴黎呢······之類，這是應時的冬裝。每一家公司和商店都張開着血盆似的大口，「英雄們」不息的擠，不息的追逐，不息的滾進滾出，每一個人都帶着一雙貪婪的眼，一幅猙獰的面具，準備攫取　者的血肉，裝成自已的欣笑。</p>
<p>汽車不斷地往來交馳着，那是『英雄們』凱奏歸來，於是街頭便常是黃塵滾滾，顯出特别的熱鬧。</p>
<p>但，假使時間是在深夜，這街頭便又換了一個世界。</p>
<p>街，如像一條死蛇，寂寂地睡着，淡淡的街燈照在蛇的背上，冷的風從黑暗處刮來，交織成死寂的網。這時候，呌賣的女郎，幽靈似的，便在這姜凉的燈光下戰憟着：而在黑暗的角落裏，弱者們更蜷伏着，如像一隻狗，飢和冷的鞭子在身上狠狠地抽着，細微的啜泣，悲哀的呻吟，這街頭便又變成了一座活地獄。</p>
<p>冬來了，窮人着慌，但，冬的盡頭不就是春嗎？春的到來也大槪不久了罷！</p>

<h3>時代与愛的歧路四</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>他一邊想，一邊拆開姊姊的信來讀。他才知道姊夫的差事於前兩星期交卸了。海泉的姊夫劉偉英，由他的舊日的同學的援引，和用了一點賄賂，在廣州做××稅的局長做了一年餘。當海泉尙在廣州時，就聽見人說過，這個××稅局是相當的好缺，不能夠長久佔據的。現在看來，他們的預評，算已實現了。姊姊的信裏又說，姊夫不想在南方再混了，或許過了年也要到南京來找職位。那末到那時，會住在上海也說不定，可以常常見面。看了姊姊的信後，才慢慢的拆開劉佩珠的信來看。他才知道姊夫是以侵呑公欵的嫌疑而被澈差的。她的信裏的内容是這様寫着的。</p>
<p>『海泉先生，！！你幾次來信都不允我對你作如是稱呼，但我還是這様的稱呼你了。你所要求於我的，我雖然願意，不過在目前，我不單無勇氣！！這並非我忘記了前約！！向你開口，並且欲落筆寫也覺得非常難爲情。希望你不要像在廣州時那様的多心而時常向我發揮你所得意的變愛獨佔論。我們的交情只求彼此眞心，不需要那些形式的表示吧。</p>
<p>『你在上海會見了珍姊沒有？她是個公式主義着，而且有十足的資產者的生活和態度。在她面前希望勿提及關於我倆的事。因爲她一定反對我們的結合的。至於理由，不單是因爲她對於變愛自由是極端的反動者，同時對於我們！！尤其是對你，在物質生活上，她是異常神經過敏的，懐着一種區視。籌之，變愛是至上的，超越一切的。不過有時是無可如何，要受環境的支配，！！尤其是受經濟的支配。當然，我並不是主張經濟將支配我們的變愛。我只希望海泉注意這一點，而更加發奮努力，打破我們的變愛不自由的環境而已。</p>
<p>『假如我們不能打開這條自由的坦道，足以促我們的變愛進展的自由的坦道，那末，我們縱匆匆結合起來，但到將來，在生活上，仍然是異常蹁蹙，異常痛苦的吧。</p>
<p>『我的姊姊那邊，無論如何，你每個月總要去一趟，敷衍敷衍。縱令你不喜歡他們的爲人，不願意看他們的生活。但是在人類社會裏，苦求一一合於本身的理想之事情及人物，那是不可以的吧。因爲我在道你的孤高的憤世疾俗的脾氣，才敢對你盡這一個忠告。你如誠懇地多和他們接近，那麽一定可以感動他們的。然則，也可以减少我們將來的結合的反抗力。平心說來，珍姊只是有些驕傲病。至於心底還是和我媽媽一様，極純厚的。她的脾氣和態度，不幸的是和我的爸爸相似了。</p>
<p>『哥哥的××局長被撤了，幸得沒有查辦。這完全是靠黃師長的力量。我從前對你說的話，還是應騐了。哥哥是一個小貪官汚吏。他已經有了不少的錢，樂得下臺了。聽說他明春就要到南京去找×××長。恨我一時不能畢業，不然我也跟着他們到上海來开學。！！我或許將丢掉這廣州的無聊的女師，立即到上海來和你商量就學的問題。</p>

<p>昨日銀洋市况與前日無甚軒輊而交易狀態、亦頗適度、大槪早市較繁而午市懈意、收解方面、因値星期六、下午銀行例假、以致許多手續不及受理、故略較平時稀少耳、至於輔幣角洋、漲風甚熾、連日秩序遞升、江角已達三分、廣角亦超出二分外矣、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市又入疲途</h3>

<h3>棉市㣲落</h3>
<p>丨廠商抛額無意扒補丨</p>
<p>棉市㣲落、因美棉趨跌、而金市忽升忽降、使人心飄搖不定、但廠需依然沉悶、故某廠商抛出大量之額、絕無扒空之念、惟買方以金價雖小、而外棉換算銀盤仍高、且各路來源凋敝、做多者变不乏人耳、</p>

<h3>過去一週中之美棉受金鎊影響失其定力</h3>
<p>紐約二日來電報告一週中之棉市云、戰債問題仍無反握、而金鎊又跌價、致過去一週中之棉市失其定力、十二月期第一次通知數量共四萬包、均爲重要現商所收去、聞此中有一萬包將輸往歐洲、棉市之跌、不僅爲上述之原因、而大宗老多頭之了結、亦有直接關係、惟南方套賣甚少耳、最近私家估計、殊足使目前大衆對於下次政府報告、將超過一千二百萬包之印象、而益爲之增加力量、訪織品市勢異常鬆懈、故買户顧慮、需要有限、大槪均靜待發展也、</p>

<h3>糧食標粉回疲</h3>
<p>丨洋麥美坎俱回跌丨</p>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份又轉傾跌之象、以洋麥報價、美坎兩方、回跌二三四六角不等、前日之極度高昂、至此未免衝動、故開價後、各月份市面、卽告不振、較前日收價、小去一分外、以後各盤、仍不見穩、迨至下午開盤、人心依然不佳、較上午又跌近分、惟二盤後、又復逐步回堅、以目下現粉去路、仍有問訊、各廠則存底甚薄、至金市昂貴、續定洋麥、未免稍受影響、所以人心見佳、步開步穩、惟天津續定洋粉、開年之粉銷、當受打擊耳、結果本月份較前日跌五厘、一月份跌一分二厘半、二月份跌一分半、三四月份跌一分、五月份跌七厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥賣方佔優勢</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致又轉傾跌、因洋麥旣回跌二三四六角、前日暴騰之氣、未免轉弱、因前日高漲時、行家曾有　出、籌碼稍豐、昨日各盤買賣、已較冷淡、惟賣方已佔優勢、開價步跌、觀察後步、當看洋麥爲轉移也、結果一月份較小一分、三月份跌四分、四月份跌五分、餘無比較云、</p>

<h3>五金純銻再現新高價</h3>
<p>純銻自回跌後、市面一落千丈、近二月中、因產地（湖南）受軍事（剿匪）影響、來貨銳减致本埠標準扶搖直上、每噸最高開至二百五十兩、目今出口生意、似覺發展、故人心更挺、標準再現新高價、每噸可估至二百六十兩、聞昨開出二十餘噸云</p>

<h3>血頭</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>在上海中下級社會裏，時時可以聽見血頭二字，加以註解，大致不外「空頭」「裝洋」，虚張聲勢，表面好看之意，不血頭不足以成爲時髦人物，不血頭不足以成爲嶄新事業，不血頭不足以成爲上海社會，上海社會故可稱爲血頭社會，</p>
<p>女子不穿大衣，裏面長衫不露也尺許，不血，學生長衫内不露出一節西裝褲子，不血，坐包車，前面不圍氈子，帽子不是二八戴，口内不銜一枝老美女或綠樹牌雪茄，不血，商店裏粘滿了犧牲血本大拍賣的標語是什麽？一本血頭，請了幾位拉拉隊在樓上吹出「結婚」式的音樂是什麽？亦是血頭，血頭的事例眞多，幾乎觸目皆是，這呌做血頭的社會，</p>
<p>開一個展覽會，不請幾位黨國要人來做幌子，不算是血頭，幾位要人不坐飛機，不是東遊山，西玩水，亦不是血頭，不是飛機大砲，到處横行，不能稱爲頭等强國血頭，在國際會議緊張的狀態中，不是口口聲聲退出國聯，裝腔作勢，不算血頭，故血頭的爲用甚廣，血頭的效用佷多，這呌做血頭的世界，　　故提起血頭二字，而想起血頭事業，眞是不少，我現在不來再舉例子，總之，爲人不血，便是木林，不能立脚於社會，商店不血，該死，不能存在於市塲，國家不血，倒運，不能立國於世界，血哉血哉，眞是血哉，若遇到幾位吃主義飯的朋友，必定要喊一聲「血頭萬歲」但我回過頭來想想，爲什麽要血？血有什麽用處？這句話我不能答，我要請敎幾位「爺叔」，</p>

<h3>信</h3>
<p>— 何文鑫</p>
<p>他爬上櫃台去睡覺，淚珠自然的落在枕頭上，往事如一幕幕電影般的，又在腦網上排演了：</p>
<p>「在學校裏是多麽快活呀！年紀和我一様小的同學有三四十人，散課後聚在一起，打洋操，捉迷藏······誰都嘻嘻哈哈的快樂得像春天的小鳥兒！</p>
<p>「回到家裏，母親抱起我親個吻，隨即跑到廚房裏去做飯菜，因爲恐怕遲了提不上學校的課；她把所有的好東西全留給我吃，她自己情願忍飢受餓；世界上再沒有比她愛我更深的人了！眞的，呌我當學徒不是她的本意。當我離開她的前一天晚上，她含着淚對我說：「福，做母親的對不起你啊！我何嘗不想你和别人家孩子一様的上進，我也知道當學徒是一件沒出息的事情。不過進中學一年要二三百塊錢，進大學一年要五六百塊錢，你的父親苦死了也苦不出這許多。與其到那個時候半途而廢。不如自己有一種行業，將來也好混一碗飯吃。」？</p>
<p>「從此，我就被烏蓬船帶到離家很遠的此地來了！就是說；從温熱的火爐旁落入冰冷的雪窖了······」</p>
<p>他將過去和現在對比，愈覺得這種生活的難堪，他像决心做某件事似的爬起來。兩小面顂已興奮得通紅了！</p>
<p>從他貼身的襯衫裏，抽出兩張紙一個信封和一枝鉛筆，他把在國民小學裏認的字統統收集起來，藉着從店板門縫透進的月光，决心要寫一封信給他的母親。</p>
<p>「媽媽！今天老板又打了我一頓，同事們也欺負我，他們全沒有我的媽媽和我的同學們可愛，我想回家，又認不得路，媽媽！頂好你來帶我回去！</p>
<p>你的兒子福」</p>
<p>他寫完了，念一遍，覺得很好。又在信封上寫：</p>
<p>「請你給我的媽媽。」</p>
<p>他把信紙摺好，放在信封裏，心裏安靜多了。準備明天買烟時愉愉的放在信筒裏。他這夜睡得很好，並且做了許多甜美的夢。</p>

<h3>續隱語新詮</h3>
<p>— 允宗</p>
<p>李頓那個才滑頭做出來的「國聯調查團報告書」中，所說的滿洲問題解决辦法，處處不尊重我國的主權，差不多提倡國際共管，眞是北番人講家常，（一篇胡話）！</p>
<p>在這資本主義崩潰的前夜，各國失業人數，日見增多，失業者成羣結隊，今天示威，明天請願，當局對此，沒有圓滿解决的方法，眞是船頭上跑馬，（走頭無路）！</p>
<p>山東韓劉啓釁，四川叔姪相爭，弄得百姓們受驚逃難，急急如喪家之犬，惶惶若漏網之魚，露宿風餐，挨餓受凍，眞是啞子吃黃連，（說不出的苦）！</p>
<p>梁作友大吹牛皮，竟說捐欵三千萬給政府，行政院起先欵以上賓之禮，後來西洋鏡拆穿，方知大上鬼當！眞是麻雀吃礱糠，（空快活）！</p>
<p>現今我國骨憂外患，紛至沓來，而全國上下，大都在醉生夢死之中，華族之復興，恐怕是和尙討老婆，（嘸日脚）一</p>
<h3>女人在上海</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>「女人在上海！」某雜誌上一位作者感慨地這様說：</p>
<p>坦闊的馬路，楓樹，紅樓一角，梵啞鈴和歌喉的合奏；斐爾楷，飛奔，巨大的窗飾，高跟鞋打着石級，高貴的巴黎香粉，手提袋，鈔票；電影院，英俊的伴侶，狂吻，肉香四溢，兒童恕不招待。！出賣魂靈的亨樂者，女人在上海！</p>
<p>但是，朋友，請示你跑出象牙之塔，卸下你的着色眼鏡，立在十字街頭！</p>
<p>天還沒有亮，工廠的汽管狂吼着，在每一間附近的草棚内，許多幽靈都從破敗的被絮中爬起來，每個憔悴的面容，凑近缺了角的鏡子前。冷水洗過臉，殘羹冷飯充了餓，預備足午餐的食料，怱忙地向工廠奔去：惟恐遲到之後，被工頭責駡，或者更不幸被扣了工資，他們每天汗血去換的幾毛錢，工廠内，譬喩說：木錠子同紗稱過之後，她們的細心的工作，不然，歸還的時候，分量是减輕了。她們每天戰戰兢兢的工作，病，沒有人顧問！死，沒有人憐惜；</p>
<p>還有；</p>
<p>華燈初上，開始上海的不夜天，有絕對不能享樂的人，出賣她們的肉體，供給旁人享樂，在上海，這類地鉃生活的女子，好像脫離了「人」的範圍：僅是一架洩慾的器具，供人利用。白粉，紅脂，遮罩了本來的面目，提高了誘人的喉音，更避過巡捕的耳目，向她們的目的物作不由衷的微笑，她們不是下賤女子；她們也會享樂。但是她們不能出賣整個魂靈，却零零出賣她們的肉體。</p>
<p>舉例，夠了。女人在上海丨</p>
<p>坦闊的馬路，楓樹，紅樓一角，梵亞鈴和歌喉的合奏；斐爾楷，飛奔，巨大的窗飾，高跟鞋打着石級，高貴的巴黎香粉，提袋，紗票；電影院，英俊的伴侶，狂吻，肉香四溢，兒童恕不招待。丨女人在上海丨</p>

<p>梁媽是一個寡婦，年紀已經五十多歲，單生一個兒子，名庚生，所以非常的疼愛，在十五歲上才給他在一爿洋貨店裏做學徒，非常得師友的贊許！</p>
<p>當梁媽守節的時候，祇有四十多歲，現在看見兒子長大了，心房中多麽的歡忭，快樂，不枉十年守節的茹苦，於是：在快樂中造成了一件慘事，俗語所謂『樂極生悲』吧！</p>
<p>因爲我國習俗，專重嗣續，尤其一般婦人，歡喜早抱子孫，繞圍膝下，當然：梁媽　具有這種心理，所以托親戚們做媒，物色一個媳婦，希望早日抱一個兒孫，接續香烟。所以庚生在十六歲就完了婚。</p>
<p>當庚生完婚的時候，還在學徒時代，沒有自立能力，並且；正値發育時代，青春之火，多麽旺烈！常常托故回到家裏，過他温柔之鄕，於學業一方，荒惰逾常，慮受師友的訓責，可是；，處在這種環境之中，庚生的行爲，已非昔比，常和師友等口角，終至被歇，當然；中途廢學的學徒，不容易再覓職業，賦閒家居。</p>
<p>庚生自賦閒家居後，不思維持生計，在在依賴母親，梁媽常常訓令庚生，覓一件職業，可是；沒有一件技能的庚生，那裏辦行到？俗諺說：『坐吃者要山空，』經不起梁生坐吃半年，經濟漸漸恐絀，於是；母責子，妻怪夫，家庭無寗日，在庚生受到母親和妻子的冷諷熱嘲，累次氣憤成疾，况且：庚生在早年娶親，根本虧耗，水不濟火，陰不涵陽，臥病三月，終至和濁世長逝。爲求早日得嗣續的梁媽，哭得多麽的悲戚！一怒而遷及媳婦，說她命中犯了『望門寡』呢！</p>
<p>唉！上面的家庭，因爲要緊嗣續，反而；斷絕嗣續，在中國極多這種家庭，所以各國的人口，日見其增，我國的人口，日見其减，在民族前途，堪足担憂的啊！</p>

<h3>同情者（三續）</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>孟國寳挀了瓜子磕着，似乎在這裏面，另感到一種香脆的趣味很靜默的在那裏咀嚼着。在大家都沉靜的時候，可以聽到王老二媳婦手裏呼哩呼哩，扇着扇子的響聲。在那月色如銀之下，雖看不到她的相貎如何，然而還可以看出她健强而不粗笨的身體。她似乎知道這位城裏來的先生，有些偷看她，有時用手摸摸頭髮，有時又用手扯扯衣襟。孟國寳終不便不開口了，便道，老二，你這個稻塲，收拾得很乾凈呀！王老二道，這是我和趙小狗子共用的，我一個人那用得着呀！孟國寳道，你這地方不錯，在這村子裏，可以不和别人混到一處。而且和那邊大稻塲，只隔子一個菜園子，那邊人說話，這裏聽得清清楚楚，也不寂寞。王老二道，在鄕下住慣了的人，倒不怕什麽冷淡的。孟先生，你在鄕下住不慣吧？鄕上可沒有城裏頭那様好玩。孟國寳笑道，你也喜歡在城裏住嗎？王老二聽了這話，不免引起了他對於城市的羡慕心，用手掻着頭髮道，自然哪！我就常對她說，我若是發了財，一定帶她到省裏去，看迎江寺那個大塔。孟國寳笑道，省城裏好玩的地方，也太多了，何止那一座塔？現在靠江岸又修了馬路。王老二道，果然的，我聽說，馬路和平的街道　不同，是洋泥和石子舖成功，雨落到地上沒有泥，風吹到地上不起灰，平得像桌面子一様。晚上路邊電燈亮了，地下吊了一根針，都檢得起來。孟國寳道，可不是這様？王老二的妻，就情不自禁的挿了一句嘴問道，聽說電燈不用油，也不用人點，天黑了自己會亮，天亮了自己會黑，那是什魔原故？豈不是一件寳貝？孟國寳本想笑起來，轉念一想，若要笑，豈不得罪了她，就極力忍住了不曾作聲。王老二道，你知道麽？那是神物，他們洋學生裏先生說了，這電燈裏的火，就是收得閃電娘娘的那陰陽二火，他妻道，呀！那還了得，神仙的東西，都可以隨便拿來用。孟國寳覺得這是個發言的機會了，便道，大嫂你那裏知道？神權時代的鬼話，現在都成了事實了，以前說神仙會騰雲架霧在天上飛，現在我們只要花幾十塊錢坐飛機，就可以騰雲駕霧了。王老二的妻，還不曾答言，王老二就挿嘴道，孟先生，你怎麽這様客氣，呌她做大嫂。村子裏人都呌她王二嫂，你也就吀她王二嫂得了，孟國寳笑道’老二，我可要駁你一句了，大嫂和二嫂，有什麽分别呢？王老二道，呵喲！我沒有想到這一層，好像王二嫂，就是她的我字，要呌大嫂，就抬舉她了。孟國寳道，就呌大嫂，也是應當，你比我大好幾歲，我們還不像兄弟一様嗎？王老二聽了這話，眞不覺得由心眼裏直喜歡出來，身子站了起來，呵喲了一聲，繼而想着，在月光下和人家和顏悅色的，人家也就未必看見。因之還是坐了下來，將　拍了大腿道，孟先生爲人眞好！孟國寳對於他的話，是否已經聽到，却不得而知。因爲這個時候，他心裏想着，僅僅一個十六歲的新娘子，呌她一聲大嫂，大槪她有些不願接受。然而這様一個女人，假使她不嫁王老二，還是在家裏作個村姑姑的話，那眞是一朶天然色彩的野花，然而可惜了···他如此想着，聽到那豆架下的亂草裏，野蟲喞喞的呌，水面上吹來的晚風，由樹葉子以至於地上的長草，都瑟瑟作聲。恰是天上不一片白雲，掩着月亮，地上浮起一層薄陰，這打麥塲上，便沉寂起來了。（未完）</p>

<p>業餘週刋</p>
<h3>本刊的使命</h3>
<p>「業餘」經過了短時期的籌備，今天已能如期與讀者諸君見面了。我們在徴稿啓事上已經說過：『本刋之發行，以補助工商業敎育，改進業餘生活爲主旨。』讀者顧名思義，已可知本刋的性質與目標所在了，本可不必再寫這例行式的！使命！文字。</p>
<p>但在這民族生命社會經濟隨時有滅亡崩潰的今日，我們究應如何喚醒國人，如何建立偉大的組織基礎，方足以應付此已開始的世界歷史上空前改造的大變：振發此日就消沉的民族精神；凂回這不絕如縷的國運。記者就不能不有一點愚見，在這創刋的日子，誠懇的貢獻於讀者之前，以作我們今後共同努力的最後鵠的。</p>
<p>我們知道：店員工友學徒們，確是社會組織的中堅份子。然這輩中堅份子，能受過相當敎育的，恐怕還在少數。反顧一年來國難時期中的情形，大多數是徘徊歧路，無所適從，但是無論是改造社會環境；無論是挽救民族危急；要負起這「轉上啓下」的重任，非於知識方面，有充分的準備不可。故本刋第一個使命，是提高社會中堅份子！店員工友學徒們的敎育程度。</p>
<p>我們更知道：上海是一個繁華的所在，也可說是一個萬惡的所在，　酣歌晏舞，紙醉金迷，最足以消磨奮發有爲的青年的志氣，麻醉純潔無睱的青年的心靈。所以我們大聲疾呼，務使要負救國責任的青年，不墮入陷阱裏去。故本刋第二個使命，是改進工商界的業餘生活。</p>
<p>我們回憶到今年的紀念「九一八」。那種全市了無生氣的情形；與夫目前抵制劣貨熱度的銳减：我們全體員工們，至少要責備自己不團結不努力。所以本刋的對象，是整個的社會，而不是個人。希望讀者對於如何可以訓練我們自己，改造我們環境，以及如何復興民族的各種問題，隨時提出研究與討論。故本刋第三個使命，是團結羣衆力量共同負起救國的重任。</p>
<p>「業餘」雖小，使命却大，希望共同努力，挽救這埀亡的國運！</p>
<p>問題討論</p>
<h3>怎様對人？服務問題</h3>
<p>— 潘仰堯</p>
<p>大凡一個人在社會上服務，不外對物對事對人三種。「物」是固定的，只要你能精細謹愼，用科學方法分析，細針密縷的工夫，不怕不易解决。「事」比較難一些了，因爲有简單，有複雜，有時還有種種的變化，可是你能平心靜氣，眼快手到，用科學方法的管理，耐煩耐勞的精神，也可以迎刃而解的。獨是人的問題，最難應付，离不易討好。無論你做那一級的職員，總覺得應付人是一件最不容易的事情，此中不知受盡幾許委曲，捱盡幾許閒氣，大家都有一種說不出的苦衷。做小職員的　常常覺得上级職員的擺架子，像煞有介事；做上級職員的，常常覺得小職員的倔强，不聽指揮，不肯努力，至於同事之間，要好的固然不少，相處得來的實在不多。不是你說他躱懶，便是他說你取巧，恭順了上級職員便是說拍馬屁，上級職員多和他說了話，便是說他得竉。左也不是，右也不是，做人之難，眞難極了。其實據吾看來，人和人相處，只要各得其道，何嘗困難。天下事大都平淡，多是可以解决的，只要把最大的病根剷除盡凈，便無往而不自得了。人和人相處的病根，有三個字：</p>
<p>一個是疑字　十件誤會中，九件都從疑字中來。　　一個是驕字　十件衝突中，九件都從驕字中來。</p>
<p>一個是怒字　十件毆駡中，九件都從怒字中來。</p>
<p>一個人面色的表現最難，有時稍爲呆板些，在多疑的人看了，便以爲和吾有什麽意見了。其實，他是多疑，自生懊惱，不過因此吾的面部上表情要格外留意一些了。有時得意忘形起來，不免有些傲態，人家便覺得吾是驕傲他了。有時心上不高興，說的話響一些，面色板一些，人家便覺得吾發怒起來了。反過來講，設身處地，你自己怎様呢？明朝楊椒山先生有句話：「一個人臨事肯替别人想，便是第一等工夫」。好極，件件事先替别人想，對人便很容易了。昨天有位朋友說：「我替徴信行名錄兜廣告，碰到經理，還肯告訴吾幾句，有時還請吾坐了，詳細開示。不巧時碰到一位職員，他正在皺了眉頭做事，不識相的吾，去請問他幾聲，不是不來理會吾，便是說不要來討厭，訑訑然拒人於千里之外，眞是「閻王好見，小鬼難當」　並說：有時上級職員允許了，下級職員還要多方留難，像煞有介事的待吾，眞是「菩薩低眉金剛努目」。他說完了，吾便說，你固然是受了委曲，但是你還沒有設身處地的替人家想想，經理先生事情固忙，但總是有人替他辦理，各有專責，他不過指揮統率，所以還可以和你談談，一般職員，寫的寫，算的算，打字的打字，做得十分勞苦，你去向他問訊，他當然要表示出不高興的様子，如果從恕道上講，也是情有可原，不必動氣。說得這信朋友也笑起來了。還有一位朋友同吾說：「我在某公司做事，起初月薪二十元，吾很滿意，隔了三個月，經理先生忽然加了十元，人家爲吾慶幸，那知吾的苦痛，從此來了，同事之間，閒言閒語，不是說吾薪水大，便是說吾拍馬工，其實吾只知做吾的事，不加也是如此的做，加了也是如此的做。自從加了以後，一逢難事，他們都說這件事要煩你了，様様都推吾身上，吾多做些事，固然不怕，不過如此下去，如何受得下呢」？吾聽了以後，便說你有家室嗎？他說沒有。吾說你生活怎様。他說還覺有餘。吾便說：「那麽，請你自請减薪，看他們怎様」這位朋友聽了吾話，如法泡製，現在居然無事了。「少酬報，多工作」或者也是人和人相處的要訣呢。不過做上級職員或領袖的，也要講一講。吾在莫干山休養時，老友秦翰才君，寄吾一本「領袖學」，吾起初不大願意看他，以爲中國人是有領袖慾的，人之患在好爲領袖，所以不必再講領袖學了。後來細細一看，句句是從經騐中來，句句有道理，可見好爲人上的人，眞不容易做的；惟其不容易做，所以不能不研究一下。吾覺得書中最中肯的話是說領袖之可貴，在能「容人」，在能「調和同事」，在能「指導職員」，在能「識别人才」，在能「取人之長，補己之短」。記得黃任之先生曾和某廠領袖說：『於事於物，宜計算準確，綜核精實，於人不宜如此，却須渾厚寛大，然後人人樂爲吾用，此爲處世待人一般必要之態度』。這句金玉良言，處於人上者，如果牢牢記取，那麽人家安心一志，爲你所用，雖勞弗怨，雖苦弗辭，對人困難，自不成問題了。</p>
<p>工商界生活</p>
<h3>四頭生活職員生活</h3>
<p>— 毀尊</p>
<p>昨天的疲倦，好像還沒有完全恢復的時候，床頭的閙鐘，已在七點三十公上，噹噹地響了起來。我猛然的被牠從夢中驚醒，覺得夜來的時間過得太快，懶懶地不想起來，然而爲了生活的驅使，不得不和温和的被窩脫離關係，身體上覺得有一絲絲地冷。</p>
<p>起來後，經過了天天做慣了的拉矢，漱口，洗臉，吃早點······等事，已經八點一刻了。不得了！便倉忙地挾着一份報紙，匆匆地離開大門，擠上一路電車的三等車廂裏。因爲步武過於急促，氣是不斷的在喘着。</p>
<p>這時，正是所謂上海的Officehour。公共汽車買統資的時間中，呌做「忙碌時間」。這時間眞有些忙碌，你看，三等車箱裏，拖車裏，就是頭等電車裏，公共汽車裏，塞滿了的，都是向外灘進發的人羣。</p>
<p>車子在轉灣的地方，停了一下，老朋友張君，也從人幾中拚命的擠了上來。</p>
<p>『密斯脫張！你好麽？』我從一個人的肩頭上把聲浪送過去。</p>
<p>『啊！你也在這裏麽？·······有什麽好不好呢。還不是仍舊過着「四頭生活』張君這様答應着就擠到我面前來。</p>
<p>『什麽！「四頭生活」！什麽······』</p>
<p>『你不是也是公司裏的小職員麽？』他就：『你怎麽會不懂這「四頭生活」呢？哈哈！：我來告訴你吧！』于是他就開始的說起來。</p>
<p>『你們公司裏不是九點鐘辦公嗎？你不是八點一刻就要趕去了嗎？你擠在這裏不是爲的怕遲到嗎？當然，九點鐘以前，無論如何是要到寫字間的。但是，你假如是經理，大班，：或者是什麽高級職員的話，那你就可以慢的去了，就是十一點鐘去，也不妨事。所以，做小職員的，來要來在人家「前頭」，這是第一「頭」』</p>
<p>『唔············』</p>
<p>『那怕你疲倦到萬分，下午五點鐘不敲的時候，你總不能走，有時，甚至要到五點半或六點鐘，才有出大門的希望。然而經理，大班，：和其他高級職員，三點鐘的時候，就不見他們了。這呌做，走在人家的「後頭」，這是第二「頭」</p>
<p>『發薪水的這天，大職員的薪水信封裏，是厚得得地花花綠綠地一疊鈔票，而我們呢，薄薄地幾張，至多不過是人家的「零豆」罷了，這是第三「頭」。事情做得稍爲有一點不到的地方，大職員的鐵板的面孔，就沉了下來，多少呌你吃兩句「爬頭」，呀！這是第四「頭」</p>
<p>『來要在前頭，走要在後頭，拿的是零頭，吃的是爬頭，這不是「四頭生活」是什麽？哈哈！老兄！你和我過的一様地「四頭生活」啊！』張君大聲的在呌着。</p>
<p>車子恰巧到了目的地，我就别了張君擠下車來。倉忙地跑到寫字間裏，呀！我是頭一個。</p>
<p>『啊！「四頭生活！」我這様悵望地玩味着。』</p>

<h3>一個學徒的煩悶編輯先生：</h3>
<p>我是一個沒不受過充分敎育的孩子，也是一個對於文學和一切科學都感至興趣的孩子。不過經濟的魅力在壓迫我，使我不能發揮我的興趣的傾向。而在前年便踏入了充滿黑暗的社會，開始過那離開光明很遠的生活了。這是多麽令人感覺得觖望和痛苦呀！</p>
<p>專著</p>
<h3>甚麽是科學管理法</h3>
<p>— 張以藩</p>
<p>我們常常聽見人家說，某人做事很精明，很「科學化」：某機關成績委很好，很「科學化」。量究竟甚麽呌做「科學化」呢？科學化就是指有計劃，有條理，工作有交率，合乎科學原則的意思。現在二十世紀，是個科學的時代，無論做什麽，應該根據科學的方法，方能達到圓滿的境地，馬馬虎虎，聽天由命的辦法是完全不行的。所以「科學管理法」在最近幾十年以來，由美國戴樂爾氏FrederjkWinslowTaylor)提倡以後，英德各國的實業界，繼起採行。歐戰後，德國拿鈍禄氏（W.Rathenau）根據這方法，創議所謂「實業合理化」（Ratjonalisaton)竟復興了衰落後的德國實業，惹動全世界的注意。一九二七年國際聯盟會在日内瓦舉行國際經濟會議，决定採行。「實業合理化」。於是「科學管理法」，不僅爲歐美各國所採行，連五年計畫中的蘇俄也應時採用。在我國全國工商會議，也曾將施行合理化及科學管理法的議案，列入大會宣言中，商務印書館王雲五氏，康元印刷製罐廠項康元氏，也曾盡力提倡，且其實騐的成績都很好。　　然而「科學管理法」究竟又是甚麽呢？「科學管理法」不僅是用科學的方法改良管理和設備，或是時間和動作的研究，······這不過是「科學管理法」的一種手段；牠的眞　，在勞資雙方心理上的改革，各自認明其對於他方所負的責任，共謀實業的發展。</p>
<p>但是，科學管理法，也有三種意義：㈠狹義的，祇限用於工廠。㈡廣義的，就是把這方法推及於一切工商業，而不以工廠爲限。㈢最廣義的，不以一工廠一公司爲限，其範圍實包括全業，或全國的經濟，在這個定義之下，又稱爲「實業合理化」。</p>
<p>普通所採用的「科學管理法」可大别爲十二點。在這裏，因爲篇幅有限，不能詳細論述，祇能提綱挈領的條列如后：</p>
<p>（一）時間研究丨測量職工每日的生產能力。</p>
<p>（二）動作研究丨研究作工的基本動作，使牠最容易而最快。</p>
<p>（三）規定工作標準丨某種職工，每日應有某種成績。</p>
<p>（四）記憶便利法丨免除雜亂與錯誤。</p>
<p>（五）工作順序的規劃丨工作銜接，節省耗費。</p>
<p>（六）節省疲勞丨留着精神多工作。</p>
<p>（七）標準化丨規定出品式様丨節省設備，原料，和手績。</p>
<p>（八）简單化丨規定出品種類丨節省設備，原料，和手績。</p>
<p>（九）分析工作丨人事，報酬（工資合理化），各得其宜。</p>
<p>（十）請求設備丨節省疲勞，免除耗費，使各中工作，互相銜接。</p>
<p>（十一）嚴密組織丨確定責作，行政迅速。</p>
<p>（十二）採用成本會計丨預算正確，便利規定工作標準。</p>
<p>（十三）編製預算丨財政有系統，出納有標準。</p>
<p>（十四）辦理統計丨比較業務的得失，作營業的根據。</p>
<p>我們如果能通盤籌劃，把科學管理法好好的實行起來，不但工作效能可以增高，即整個的實業和整個的社會也就有了辦法。在中國當然更見顯著；因爲生產增加之後，能己夠用，就算了不得，至於「生產過剩」，「工人失業」這種流行病，我們是不怕的。茲將實行「科學管理法」的結果，條列如次：</p>
<p>（一）勞資關係改善丨精誠合作。</p>
<p>（二）消除耗費丨成本减低丨價廉。</p>
<p>（三）出品改良丨質量改進丨物美。</p>
<p>（四）生產增加丨股東利息優厚丨實業發展。</p>
<p>（五）工資增加丨保障職工生活丨社會安寗。</p>
<p>我國百業凋敝，生產慘落人後，旣無大規模的工廠，也談不到其麽國際貿易（除幾様土產以外）；用國際的眼光，比較來說，我們所有的，都是些小規模的企業。因此有人說：「科學管理法」是祇好適用於大規模的實業，對於我們這種小工廠小店家，「割　　用牛刀」？用不着這種「時髦洋貨」科學管理法，我們也不必去研究，也可不去採用；所以歐美各國實騐了卓着成效的「科學管理法」，至今我們採用的還很少很少，這是很可惜的一椿事情。今後我們如要振興實業，達到價廉物美的地步，挽回利權，以國根本救國，確非根本改變態度不可。希望國内一般有志的實業家用研究的態度，科學的精神，把「科學管理法」，一步一步的來實騐實騐。</p>
<p>不過，我們實行這方法，有一點應該特别注意：就是「科學精神，應注意事實。」普通人常常誤解「科學管理」，以爲實行「科學管理」即是專重「機械式」的方法，而忽略「人事」範圍的事情，不問内部的情形，削足適屢，牽强一用，此道常常不通，即在歐美各國，這種情形，在實騐期間，也是很多，這方法之被人懐疑，也就是因爲採用不得其法的緣故。我們後來，應該居上，不要再去上當，實行的時候，應該循以下的步驟：</p>
<p>（一）研究丨方法，環境。</p>
<p>（二）敎育丨宣傳，認識。</p>
<p>（三）注意職工的福利。</p>
<p>（四）獲得職工的同情與合作。</p>
<p>（五）緩進。</p>
<p>（六）堅毅到底，按步實行。</p>
<p>這様，我們才可不蹈覆轍，一帆風順的成功了。</p>
<p>貴刋的出版使我感到灰色的前途或有一綫光明，因爲貴刋的内容都是關於我們小職員服務方面的指導文字，實可說是我們目前奮鬭的指南針。</p>
<p>現在我有幾個問題，特把牠們寫在下面，希望給我一個滿意的答覆。</p>
<p>㈠當一個孩子走進「職業之門」之後，有什麽方法再來企求學問之進步？</p>
<p>㈡一個小職員爲什麽要受同事以至茶房的奚落和藐視？</p>
<p>㈢如何能達到職業上的「光明之路」？</p>
<p>㈣一個職業者研究科學的步驟丨一個對科學祇感興趣而毫無知識並且經濟困難的職業著研究科學的步驟。</p>
<p>㈤如何可以盡中華民國一份子的義務，幹抗日救國的工作？</p>
<p>周良驥上</p>
<p>編者按丨我們對於周良驥君所提出來的五個問題，認爲是今日商界中學徒們所感覺的共同問題，極有公開討論的價値。現在先將周君所提出的前四個問題分答如後：</p>
<p>㈠當一個青年走進「職業之門」之後，再要企求學問之進步，有兩個法子：</p>
<p>（甲）忠於本職。求本職之進步即是求學問之進步。學問之最切憲的無過於盡職。瓦特只是一個修理儀器的助手，因爲他對於一位敎授交給他修理的抽水機不肯敷衍了事，終於發明蒸汽機關，世界爲之一變。你莫小看你的小事，小事是做成大事的起點。人類的創造，只是小題大做罷了。</p>
<p>（乙）時間即生命。利用本職之餘暇，以追求自己歡喜追求的學問，只要有恒，必有大成。比如你對於科學有興趣，便該把你的餘睱都調動來向科學進攻，不使一有一絲一毫散到賭博塲，跳舞廳裏去。一個人不能不玩，你可以玩科學把戲，如果玩的得法，保你比打牌有趣，並且可以玩出第一流的學問來。</p>
<p>㈡一個小職員爲什麽要受同事以至茶房的奚落和藐視，這是因爲傅統觀念的流毒。我曾向幾位先生建議過，報館應該當作學問辦（不是傳統學校而是革命學校）。服務的人一律平等相待，沒有什麽大小。茶房，汽車夫一流的人本來是有過分的勢利觀念；欺貧重富，媚大侮小，是他們在不幸的環璄中取得的習慣，只有革命的敎育可以把牠們必變過來。可是我們個人也不能不下自反的功夫。肯吃虧的人終不吃虧。和氣的人是有福的。你若以一個敎育者和學生的態度與衆人相處，大槪沒有什麽大錯吧？敎育者的態度是承認人有可敎性，可與爲善性，不是好爲人師。倘若好爲人師，人又不服了。</p>
<p>㈢職業上的「光明之路」有兩條：一是萬業平等，這條路要敎育與社會的改造，兩面交攻才能打得出去；二是創造發明，這條路上，自然科學是惟一的太陽，現在被迷信，空想，肓動，瞎說的黑雲所遮蓋，必須把頭腦與雙手請出來將黑雲撥開，才能重見天日。</p>
<p>㈣一個職業者所究科學的步驟；一是親自動手玩科學把戲；二是親眼觀察自然現象和各種人造文明並追求牠的所以然；三是看指導實騐的科學書，不看洋八股和洋策論；四是每事問，打破沙鍋問到底；五是繼續不斷幹到老。眞學術是從『做』上得來的。前人有「不學無術」一句話，我的見解是；「不做無學；不做無術。」你以爲何如？</p>
<p>祝你　　努力　　　　　　　　編者答</p>
<p>最後，我們有兩點要請讀者注意的</p>
<p>㈠以上的答案，不過是我們少數人與我們的朋友討論的結果，不能算爲滿意的答覆，我們仍歡迎讀者加入討論，以收集思廣益之效。</p>
<p>㈡我們對於周君所提出的第五個問題，未加答覆，是因爲我們覺得此問題須依各種客觀條件而决定，殊難隨便的下一答案。因此，我們决定將這一個問題提出，先請讀者發表意見，討論到個</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3>盡責就快樂</h3>
<p>— 公平</p>
<p>希臘大哲學家亞里士多德曾替人類下了一個定義，呌做：「人類是理性的動物」。我們中國自古也就有人而無禮，何異禽獸」的觀念。不錯，人類所以能自詡爲萬物之靈，當然是因爲人類講理性，知道義的緣故了。可是，人類的智力不斷的向前發展，到了廿世紀的今日，就覺到人類異乎禽獸的地方，除了最寳貴的理性之外，還有更重大的特點在着哩！這更大的特點是什麽？就是最熟習於我們口頭的「勞動」</p>
<p>這裏所說的「勞動」，是廣義的，凡一切人類活動的範圍都包括在内。禽獸都是除了飢食渴飲之外，别無他事。可是人類則有目的的，不斷的，作未雨綢繆的勞動。我們要知道勞動的偉大和重要，只須隨時隨地，對於我們人類所需要的東西加以觀察，則那一件沒不吾人的勞動在内？一件東西！無論是穿的，吃的，用的，或文藝美術的作品丨愈精美高超，則它的創造，一定更艱難費事，也就是需要勞動更多。因此，我們要考查一個國家及其人民文化程度的高低，只要看它的工商業及文學美術的發展狀况，即可推知的。歐美及我們的仇敵的日本，牠們的工商業，文學美術都比我們中國發達，所以它們的文化程度咸比中國爲高，由此我們可知「勞動」怎様的是我們人類的寳貝了。因此，我們如果要想我們的祖國能和歐美日本相頡頏，我們只有盡力於各自的事業，努力去勞動，日新月異，精益求精，庶幾才能達到目的啊！</p>
<p>人類要勞動，也祇有勞動，才能無盡期的生存下去。如果不勞動，就是死。個人不勞動，個人死，民族不勞動，那個民族也必遭滅亡。有不勞動而享受現成的人，他就是人類的蟊賊，我們不必羨慕他，我們應該以我們所流的汗向他誇示。因爲勞動是人人必盡的責任啊！</p>
<p>勞動旣然是每個人所應盡的責任，那末，我們何以常常聽到勞動着的人們在怨尤生活，厭恨勞動呢？我們一考查他們的生活狀况，確是非常困頓，令人可憫，反之，愈是不勞動而享受現成的人愈是生活美滿。這是因爲現在社會制度不良的緣故。我們認定泥水木匠的勞動，在價値上看來，是和坐在設計室内的工程師相等的，警察固然是爲人民服務的，而倒馬桶的糞夫也是一様的盡責。那末，我們對於我們當前的現狀，怎様呢？失望嗎？咒詛嗎？消極嗎？自然都不中用，我以爲我們只有更努力工作才是出路。</p>
<p>我們明白，天堂並不在亞爾伯斯峯，樂園也並不在西方。天堂和樂園只存在於我們努力的勞動中。我們只有利用餘暇的時間，作增進自己能力的條養，有了能力，任他怎様頑强不合理的制度都可以衝破。從自己更美滿的事業創造中，才能得到快樂，也祇有這種快樂才是眞正的快樂！眼前我們縱使是苦痛，被一般人所輕視，但是我們辛勤的成績，總有一天被重視的丨</p>

<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Negotiations at the League of Nations</h3>
<p>US Participation and the Trend of Denying Legitimacy to the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Matsuoka Meets with MacDonald and Herriot</p>
<p>Reasons for Transferring the Sino-Japanese Dispute to the General Assembly</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although British Prime Minister MacDonald's talks on disarmament with the representatives of the United States, France, Italy, and Germany have temporarily set aside the Sino-Japanese issue, behind the scenes, activity is quite intense among smaller nations concerned about this issue and within the League of Nations Secretariat. The issues of concern to the smaller nations are the question of US participation and the possibility of a resolution recognizing "Manchukuo." Several countries believe that the General Assembly should not pass any resolutions and that the matter should be entirely entrusted to the Committee of Nineteen, as this approach is most likely to gain the sympathy of the United States. This is because the United States itself is in a difficult position and would prefer to see the League of Nations handle the matter with greater freedom. However, at the same time, others advocate for the passage of a resolution denying recognition of "Manchukuo," so that the League of Nations can align its position with that of the United States. This is generally the trend for the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of US participation, it has been suggested that the General Assembly could authorize the Committee of Nineteen to select other members of equal status without specifying nationality. Japan's attitude toward this matter is particularly noteworthy, as Japan opposed US participation last year based on procedural grounds. However, it is widely believed that Japan can be expected to change its attitude toward participation in the Conciliation Committee, as Japan itself is now prepared to participate in committee meetings when invited. If neither China nor Japan objects, US participation should not encounter any difficulties. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Representative Koo Sends Another Letter to the League of Nations Refuting Matsuoka's Memorandum, Recounting Japan's Unsettled Situation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, our representative Koo Vi-kyuin sent another lengthy letter to the League of Nations refuting the statement by Japanese representative Matsuoka, recounting Japan's unsettled situation under military rule, and recalling Japan's past intense acts of xenophobia, which are vastly different from the reasonable economic self-defense methods adopted by China today. (Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Courts Major Powers, Meets with Key Figures from the US, Britain, and France</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Representative Matsuoka met with British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Prime Minister Herriot to explain Japan's reasons and circumstances for taking a last stand on the Sino-Japanese issue, seeking their understanding in order to establish a fundamental policy of the major powers of Britain and France towards the issue. It is confirmed that the British and French Prime Ministers have matters requiring their return to their countries after the conclusion of the Disarmament Conference, so although they attended the Special General Assembly, they only attended once or twice, and thereafter representatives Simon and Boncour handled everything. After meeting with Representative Matsuoka, British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Prime Minister Herriot each discussed the matter with Simon and Boncour, seemingly to determine the attitude of Britain and France toward the issue. It is rumored that after Prime Minister Herriot met with Representative Matsuoka in Paris, an understanding was reached between the two. If this is the case, then according to predictions, there will be no major events at the subsequent General Assembly, and everything will be transferred to the Committee of Nineteen. (Dentsu, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese Representative Matsuoka's qualification to appear before the Committee of Nineteen is only as an explainer, without the authority to make active proposals or other statements. This is somewhat less freedom than in the Council, but the Japanese delegation does not regard this as important. The basis of Japan's argument is that it has already fully stated its position twice, at the beginning and end of the general discussion at the General Assembly plenary session. Thereafter, even if it attends any meeting, it is only to supplement points that are insufficiently understood, and there is no need for any action. Therefore, according to the situation to date, if the Committee of Nineteen itself finds it very difficult to discover a solution that Japan can accept, then in practice, private talks between the major powers running parallel to this are the key to a resolution. (Dentsu, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese disarmament representative Tsuneo Matsudaira visited US representative Davis at 7:30 PM yesterday to discuss disarmament issues, stating that Japan has a new proposal. The purpose of the new proposal is to respect the existing power of each country and its special circumstances. Davis replied that if a proposal cannot be accommodated by all countries, then discussion will be of no avail. Matsudaira then referred to the Manchurian case, wanting to use disarmament to restrain the Manchurian issue, but the US representative ignored this, saying that the Manchurian case is already under deliberation at the League of Nations, and the United States is unwilling to express its opinion in advance. (Hwalien, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to indirect news from Geneva, Matsuoka Yosuke, due to the fact that the attitude of the German authorities could not be underestimated when the General Assembly discussed the Sino-Japanese dispute, in order to win over the German representative at the General Assembly to support the Japanese position, rushed to Berlin on the afternoon of the 1st to visit the German representative, asking for their understanding of the Japanese position, and after meeting with key figures in the German authorities, returned to Geneva at 6 PM last night. (Far East News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>According to the Eastern Newspaper, reliable sources have revealed that Matsuoka Yosuke, the Japanese representative in Geneva, made several proposals during his recent meeting with Davis, the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, to prevent Japan-US relations from deteriorating, and allowed him to visit the United States after the League of Nations General Assembly ended, in order to obtain US understanding of the Sino-Japanese dispute. It was also learned that Davis expressed his personal opinion, saying that he hoped Japan would do its utmost to avoid a direct conflict with the great powers in Geneva, and to use a constructive plan to achieve a harmonious resolution. Matsuoka got the impression from what Davis said that Davis was hinting that China should retain some form of suzerainty over Manchukuo, while also expressing that the United States did not want to express much opinion on the League of Nations side. The conversation between Matsuoka and Davis is regarded as very important, and it is also noteworthy that discussions between Japan and the United States regarding the Manchurian issue will be held in the United States after the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting ends.

<h3>Japanese Side Attaches Importance to the Organization of the Conciliation Committee, Advocates for Restriction of its Authority</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Official circles here are now paying serious attention to the proposal to organize a Sino-Japanese dispute conciliation committee at the League of Nations Special General Assembly. People here believe that if the Conciliation Committee does not include the two parties in the dispute, then the result may be an irresponsible solution imposed on China and Japan. If representatives from China and Japan are included, then the intervention of a third party may hinder a solution based on Sino-Japanese negotiations. Japanese official circles advocate that the authority of the Conciliation Committee must be restricted. There are now rumors in Geneva of not recognizing "Manchukuo" and delaying the resolution of the Manchurian issue, believing that Japan will therefore fall into financial deadlock, and that the steady faction in Japan may rise up and force Japan to make concessions to the League of Nations. It should be known that those who harbor this hope will ultimately be disappointed. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, members of the House of Representatives gathered in the Speaker's office and unanimously passed a resolution, in the name of Speaker Akita, sending a telegram to Japanese representative Matsuoka in Geneva, expressing the House of Representatives' appreciation for the hard work of the Japanese delegation in Geneva, and earnestly hoping that the Japanese representative will redouble his efforts to make the League of Nations members understand Japan's position, and abide by Japan's established policy toward "Manchukuo." (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Issue of Resolution Deadline, Hymans Sends Letter to Representative Yen</h3>
<p>Clarifying the Reason for Inability to Immediately Stipulate, Geneva Pays Attention to the Situation of the Righteous Army</p>
<p>(Geneva) Hymans, chairman of the Committee of Nineteen, regarding the matter of stipulating a deadline for discussing the Sino-Japanese dispute, sent a letter to Dr. Yen Hui-ching. In the letter, Hymans stated that the Special Committee is well aware of the importance of Dr. Yen's request to stipulate a deadline, but feels that until the opinion of the League of Nations General Assembly is known, the Special Committee cannot immediately study and resolve such an event related to the extension of the deadline. Therefore, only after the end of the General Assembly discussion will the Special Committee be able to begin studying the possible ways to resolve this case, and determine the issue of a deadline. The general public is now paying close attention to the progress of the war in Manchuria. The news that the Japanese army is attacking the Chinese righteous army within Manchuria, without regard for the lives of the Japanese held hostage, prompted a statement by the Chinese spokesperson today, saying that the righteous army in the country is treating Japanese civilians in the war zone humanely, such as the release of 121 Japanese in Manchouli on October 30 and the escort of 38 Japanese residents of Hailar out of the country on November 21, all of which are examples. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Reasons for Transfer to the General Assembly</h3>
<p>(Geneva) People within the League of Nations, fearing that outsiders may misunderstand the authority of the League of Nations General Assembly and the Administrative Council to handle the Sino-Japanese dispute, specially explained to reporters that this time, each councilor authorized the Administrative Council to transfer the Lytton Report to the League of Nations General Assembly, just like the initial report method of the Lytton Investigation Team. Otherwise, councilors could at most only comment on the report. Because the Sino-Japanese dispute has been transferred to the General Assembly, the Council will no longer make any suggestions or take any action on the resolution. The statement made by the chairman of the Administrative Council, Vanlerella, a few days ago, that the Administrative Council can still propose the Lytton Report again after passing a corresponding resolution, only refers to discussion. Because the Lytton Investigation Team was dispatched to Manchuria by the Administrative Council based on Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant, and its investigation report is also based on that article, but since the departure of the Investigation Team, China has also proposed Article 10 and Article 15 of the Covenant, transferring the Sino-Japanese dispute to the League of Nations General Assembly. Although Japan protested, it was repeatedly rejected by the Administrative Council, which declared that either party in this case had sufficient reason to propose Article 15 and request the League of Nations General Assembly to handle it. Thereafter, the League of Nations General Assembly also clearly declared in the resolution on March 2 that this entire dispute, which constitutes the purpose of the Chinese government's application, has been transferred to the League of Nations General Assembly, and requested the Administrative Council to provide various opinions and documents deemed valuable. Therefore, this case should be resolved by the League of Nations General Assembly, and the Lytton Report should be transferred to the General Assembly. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Another Set of Tricks, a Puppet Telegram from a Puppet Government</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation forwarded to the League of Nations General Assembly telegrams from the "Manchukuo" Foreign Minister and so-called Manchurian People's Organizations expressing their opinions on the Lytton Report. The "Manchukuo" Foreign Minister's telegram stated that the Manchukuo government received more than 3,000 petitions from the Manchurian people, which shows that "Manchukuo" has the support of the majority of the people. They believe in the bright future in view of the gradual improvement of administration. Since the establishment of the new country, the previous malpractices have been completely eliminated, and a government ruled by law has been vigorously implemented, reducing military expenditures to one-third of what they were before. Order is gradually being restored. Several sections of the Lytton Report that oppose "Manchukuo" are based on prejudice and do not conform to the facts. The people of "Manchukuo" absolutely cannot agree with the opinions in the Lytton Report. The suggestions in the report cannot establish peace, but only increase disturbances. The people of "Manchukuo" firmly oppose any plan that changes the existing state of affairs or hinders the independence and progress of "Manchukuo". Examining the Lytton Report, it is clear that the investigation team had preconceived notions before entering Manchuria. When the investigation team was in Manchuria, it did not adopt active methods to investigate public opinion, but received thousands of letters of dubious origin. The investigation team used this as a basis to make bold and rash conclusions, which the people of "Manchukuo" find extremely infuriating, and so on. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Traitorous Representatives Are Active in Different Directions</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Traitor Ding Shi-yuan arrived in Geneva on the 2nd. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Pseudo-representative Bao Cheng, because the situation at the League of Nations is unfavorable to Japan, is related to the survival of the pseudo-organization, and the puppet status is in danger of being overthrown, today invited reporters from various foreign news agencies in Tokyo to strongly express his views. The content of his statement is exactly the same as that described by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, so reporters from various countries ignored him. (Hwalien, 2nd)</p>
<p>Fu and Tang's Troops Repel Japanese and Traitorous Allied Forces</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Huadian Area for Several Days</h3>
<p>Tang Juhwu Sternly Refuses Japanese Persuasion to Surrender, Troops Transferred Under the Command of Wang Yuncheng</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yuguan 3rd Morning Telegraph: The National Salvation Army troops led by Fu Dianchen, etc., retreated to the Jilin-Changchun Railway line to join up with the Self-Defense Army troops led by Tang Juhwu, gathering in Huadian to prepare for a counterattack. Japanese and traitorous forces attacked from three routes: Chaoyang Town, Xiaochengzi, and Yantongshan. From the 28th to the 30th, they fought a bloody battle, which was extremely fierce. Various detachment teams from Fu and Tang outflanked the enemy, and the Japanese and traitorous forces were attacked from both sides, so they retreated, leaving behind a large amount of military supplies. (3rd Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After being besieged by four Japanese divisions in Tonghua, Tang Juhwu retreated to a certain place due to insufficient supplies. After his troops were handed over to Wang Yuncheng, he disguised himself and secretly went to a certain place to make contact. Zhu Gongchen, the Secretary-General of Tang's Secretariat, said that from October 1 of last year to November 15 of this year, they fought with the Japanese army more than one hundred times. This time, the Japanese invaded with the strength of four divisions, and used 20 airplanes to bomb in rotation every day. In order to preserve strength, he handed over all the troops to Wang Yuncheng to lead. The Japanese established the East Asia Ethnic Alliance in Fushun, and sent representatives to persuade Tang to surrender, offering 1.2 million in cash, which Tang refused. After that, he decided to resist to the end. (3rd Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The headquarters of the People's Dare-to-Die Army ordered the Wang and Song units of the First and Second Routes to actively prepare to attack the two cities of Suizhong and Panshan. The Jing and Lin units of the Third and Fourth Routes joined forces with the civilian army to build a defensive fortification of more than 400 li from Yixian to Suizhong. War clouds are spreading throughout the area, and a major battle is about to break out. (3rd Special Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Because transportation in Rehe is inconvenient, Japan is advancing slowly. Currently, the Liaoning Arsenal and various factories in Japan are rushing to build 5,000 heavy-duty trucks, each of which can carry 20 soldiers and is equipped with two machine guns and one new-style 7cm light gun. The Japanese in Shishan, Dalinghe, and other stations are recruiting soldiers on a large scale, offering 25 yuan for each cavalryman and 50 yuan for each infantryman, planning to recruit six brigades. (3rd Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde stated that the Japanese are buying over traitors, bribing our officers and soldiers in Chaoyang Temple, Chengde, and other places, offering 30 yuan for each soldier. If they bring their troops with them, they will receive a special reward. It was decided to start the bribery with lower-ranking officers. The Chengde Public Security Bureau arrested a traitor named An Yanzhong in Shizigou. According to his confession, he was bribed by the Japanese to gather our military intelligence and is now in custody. (3rd Special Telegraph)</p>

The Japanese are secretly transporting a large number of Japanese troops from the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line, all of whom are stationed at the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line railway station. Japanese planes have been flying to Chaoyang to scout for several days, but have not dropped bombs. Our morale is very high. (3rd Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Rehe Anti-Japanese Army, He Minhun's troops, and Wang Xingwu's division occupied Beizhen at dawn on the 3rd. Li Haifeng's division is still in Mengjiatun.

<h3>Pang Bingxun and Others Advise Feng to Temporarily Leave Zhangjiakou to Quell Outside Rumors</h3>
<p>Three Reasons for Song Zheyuan's Resignation</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because of the rampant rumors about Feng from the outside world, Lu Zhonglin, Liu Zhi, Pang Bingxun, and others recently jointly wrote a letter to Feng, advising him to take a trip to Datong for the time being. (3rd Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Reasons for Song Zheyuan's resignation: 1. The finances of Chahar Province are difficult, and it is impossible to meet the various military and administrative expenses. Increasing taxes would be opposed by the people. 2. Feng Yuxiang resides in Zhangjiakou, and rumors are rampant from the outside world. Feng's subordinates in Shandong receive 7,000 yuan in living expenses from Han every month, but Chahar Province is financially strapped and cannot respond to Hong. 3. Song Zheyuan's back pain is very severe and it is difficult to take on the heavy workload. It is estimated that the Central Government will approve Song's sick leave for two months. Feng Yuxiang may go to Datong, and various parties are now dispatching personnel to mediate. (3rd Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain high-ranking military official formerly under Feng Yuxiang personally visited Feng in Zhangjiakou a few days ago, and returned to Beiping from Zhang yesterday. He told reporters that Feng recently issued a Jiang telegram due to the rampant rumors from the outside world, stating his personal views on the current situation. He will have a proposal when the Third Plenary Session is convened, and he does not intend to go to Nanjing to participate, nor does he intend to return to Shandong to live there again. Because he is very comfortable living in Zhangjiakou, he will not go elsewhere for the time being. He studies sociology with the people in the research society every day, and his attitude is unusually leisurely. He will never change his stance on armed resistance against Japan.

<h3>What Serves as the Backing for Diplomacy? - Du Liang</h3>
<p>The special meeting of the League of Nations, watched by the world, has been decided to be convened on December 6th. The transition procedures from the Executive Yuan to the General Assembly will be handled by the Committee of Nineteen. At the meeting, there will inevitably be a fierce and magnificent debate. The verbal spears and lip halberds of the two involved countries go without saying. Even the righteous indignation that the representatives of small countries have accumulated against the aggressor countries will have the opportunity to be fully vented. This will seek due support for justice and fairness, and preserve the declining prestige of the League of Nations itself. The tension in the air in Geneva can be imagined.</p>
<p>The Japanese know very well that excessive aggression will no longer be tolerated by the great powers. They know that small countries generally have no goodwill toward them. They know that their accumulated barbaric attitude can no longer be explained away by ordinary tools of concealment. Therefore, they are willing to act recklessly and collapse completely. Domestically, they are actively preparing for war to stimulate the emotions of their own people. Externally, they are adopting special tactics to confuse international perception. On the one hand, they claim to withdraw from the League of Nations to intimidate the great powers. On the other hand, they are doing their best to win over small countries in a roundabout way to seek understanding. On the one hand, they are doing their utmost to denigrate our country's internal affairs. On the other hand, they are spreading the air of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. Their arrangements are meticulous, and their scheming is deceptive. Under the heavy smokescreen, there is something far beyond what ordinary people can imagine. We, with the pain of being carved up, hope for the extension of justice. On the diplomatic stage, the words are direct and the tone is strong. Representatives Yan, Gu, and Guo are calmly prepared and waiting for the opportunity. We need not worry about them from afar. However, how to seize the pretext of slander and how to make the three representatives' speeches more powerful requires the concerted efforts of the entire country.</p>
<p>What is meant by effort? It means quickly ending the civil war and striving for unity. For soldiers of a country, when foreign invaders invade, they do not plan to resist the enemy, but instead engage in internal strife. What a shameful thing this is! When the diplomatic situation is as serious as it is today, and they still do not know how to coordinate their steps, then this is even more shameful. The Japanese are slandering us as not being a nation, with the intention of finding an excuse for their violation of the covenant. When our soldiers encounter such a serious situation and still do not stop fighting, are they not being laughed at by those who slander us too much? And are they not handing the three representatives who are going to the League of Nations a very difficult obstacle to defend?</p>
<p>Moreover, our current efforts to seek unity are not only to seek coordinated steps in diplomacy, but also to establish a basic barrier in military affairs. There has never been a case where internal division and disintegration can lead to long-term resistance against foreign enemies, nor has there ever been a case where wielding weapons against one's own people can lead to a diplomatic victory. Once the internal strife ceases and unity is achieved, then the diplomatic representatives can speak freely and develop their arguments, and the initial preparations for long-term resistance can also begin. The hasty conclusion of the Shanghai War and the ability of the Japanese troops to withdraw as scheduled had various other reasons. The key was that the calm response of the 19th Route Army at that time and the focus of national attention on one corner forced the Japanese to quickly withdraw their target. According to those familiar with the inside story of the Japanese army, the Japanese's first move was only to demonstrate in Shanghai to divert the attention of the Chinese people from the Northeast. They did not expect the garrison to resist so quickly, which turned into a situation of unity in our country. Therefore, their second move was to hastily end the Shanghai War in order to pour their strength into the Northeast and quietly observe the internal conflicts in our country. Unfortunately, our military men were blindly involved, and fell into their trap. The blood of the Shanghai War had not yet dried, and internal strife erupted immediately! The Japanese representative Nagaoka Harukazu broadcasted from the League of Nations broadcasting station, saying that the reason why Japan's continental policy had repeatedly won was due to the united support of the people. The Tokyo Women's Association Federation, with the power of two million members, passed a resolution also stating that in the face of internal and external troubles, they should unite and do their best for the country. They are the initiators of aggression, and their country is still spurring itself on with unity. Can it be said that our country, which is being bullied, can cook beans and burn stalks to hasten its own demise? In ancient times, before the Common Era, the Greek city-states were in a state of disunity. However, when the Persian army pressed the border, they were able to unite and save themselves from disaster, resisting the strong neighbors. The prestige of the Athenian fleet in the Battle of Salamis was enough to wash away the shame of the Spartan king's death in battle. Can China in the 20th century not arouse the idea of unity to defend its country?</p>
<p>If this is understood, then the interaction of unity has been seen. Instead of pointing fingers and glaring at the slanderous accusations of the Japanese, we should quickly eliminate the chaos to silence the critics. Instead of lamenting the seriousness of the diplomatic situation, we should clearly break down barriers to jointly seek consistent development. Learning from history and observing the current situation, what other way is there to survive besides unity? The soldiers of Sichuan and Guizhou, if there is still a trace of conscience left, should repent, change their ways, and make a new plan. This is the time!</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Solemnly Declares Denial of Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>Deeply Believes That the League of Nations Will Be Able to Seek a Fair and Appropriate Solution</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles are concerned about the rumor of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, which is purely a fabrication by some party, hoping to confuse international public opinion. Previously, President Song and Minister Luo declared to the representatives of various countries in China that it was not true. On the 3rd, Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to representatives Yan, Gu, and Guo in Geneva, strongly denying it. It can be seen that the claim of direct negotiations is purely fabricated. Chiang's telegram stated that the Sino-Japanese issue is currently being resolved by the League of Nations. However, some people are spreading rumors that Zhongzheng personally advocates direct negotiations, intending to alienate the League of Nations and confuse public opinion. In addition to the government's denial by President Song and Foreign Minister Luo to the representatives of various countries, Zhongzheng hereby solemnly declares that he has never advocated direct negotiations and firmly believes that the League of Nations will be able to maintain the dignity of the League of Nations Covenant and other treaties and seek a fair and appropriate solution to the Sino-Japanese issue.

The report also includes recommendations from Chief of Staff MacArthur to expand the army by 40 percent and from Assistant Secretary of War Davison to continue the construction of aircraft.</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Reuters) – In his annual report to the President, the Secretary of War requested that the U.S. standing army be increased to 14,000 officers and 164,000 soldiers, with generous pay and all new-style weaponry. The Secretary of War opposes granting the Philippines independence within twenty years because the political situation in the East is currently unsettled. It is noted that the current U.S. standing army consists of 12,000 officers and 121,000 soldiers.</p>
<p>Washington, 3rd (National News Agency) – Today, Mr. Banker, advisor to the Chinese government, stated that he will begin to lobby senators to oppose the Hawes-Cutting Philippine Independence Act because the tax provisions in the bill will greatly harm the businesses controlled by Chinese residing in the Philippines. The bill stipulates that tariffs on Philippine goods will gradually increase from the passage of the bill until the establishment of the Philippine constitution. Banker stated that he will continue to oppose the bill until he receives assurance that it will be amended to protect Chinese businesses and prevent the exclusion of Chinese after Philippine independence. He claims to have considerable support for his position.</p>
<h3>White House Continues Discussion of War Debt Issues</h3>
<p>Stimson Indicates No Need to Respond to British and French Notes</p>
<p>U.S. May Temporarily Accommodate Debtors by Allowing Revised Interest Payments</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (National News Agency) – Today, President Hoover, Secretary of State Stimson, and Treasury Secretary Mills held their second meeting to discuss the war debt issue, lasting a considerable time. After the meeting, when Secretary Stimson returned to the State Department, reporters asked when the U.S. reply would be drafted. Stimson replied that there may be no need to reply. He also said that the discussion had not yet yielded any results. According to international custom, notes from friendly nations must be answered. Stimson's statement that there may be no need to reply to the British and French notes, without further explanation, has led to various speculations and rumors. Some say that the State Department may soon receive unofficial documents from the British and French embassies, while others say that the President is discussing potential solutions with the Secretary of State and the Treasury Secretary, and has decided to continue discussions for at least another day. According to sources close to the government, tomorrow is Saturday, and the commodity and stock markets will only be open for half a day. Although the U.S. government's attitude cannot be decided immediately, it should not cause a major impact. However, the price declines in all markets today were purely due to the uncertainty of the war debt issue, indicating its seriousness.</p>
<h3>President Hoover Hesitates</h3>
<p>Washington, 2nd (National News Agency) – According to reliable sources, the President appears to be still hesitating on the war debt issue. It is rumored that he will submit a special report to Congress next week because the President considers this matter extremely important and will not address it in the regular report along with other economic issues. He will prepare a special report detailing the government's position. The original proposal to have a separate committee handle the war debt issue is said to have lost its momentum. Official circles have acknowledged that Treasury Secretary Mills may be able to announce, before December 15th, a temporary accommodation regarding the ninety-day notice clause in the war debt agreement, allowing Britain, France, and other debtor nations to defer principal payments, but interest payments must still be paid as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Borah Believes British Note is Justified</h3>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Havas) – Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, believes that outright cancellation or reduction of war debts is not enough to improve the world's economic situation. He also said, "Regarding the world's economic situation, my opinion is completely the same as the British note. The British note states that as long as various reasons for reducing confidence exist, the countries of the world will not be able to revive commerce. Not only will they not be able to revive commerce, but they will also not be able to find a way to restore the structure of commerce to normal. I deeply agree with this view. However, although the war debt issue is closely related to reducing confidence, it is not the only reason. The British note describes the terrifying state of global decline in great detail. To attempt to save it, no palliative measures or ineffective plans can succeed," and so on.</p>
<h3>Tear Gas is No Match for Bottles and Rocks</h3>
<p>American Hungry People Clash with Police</p>
<p>Wilmington (Delaware), 2nd (National News Agency) – Tonight, the petitioning team of hungry people had its first clash with the police here. The hungry people were holding a meeting when the police ordered them to disperse. When the hungry people refused, the police attempted to use force. Suddenly, bottles and stones were thrown from the crowd. The police then called for reinforcements and attacked with tear gas, immediately dispersing the hungry people. There were about 1,200 of them, intending to enter Washington on Monday morning together after the western hungry people's petitioning team arrived. Now that a clash has occurred, their leaders fear that it will be difficult to organize the team to enter the capital. They will have to sneak into the capital individually and then gather. Most of them are still able to maintain order, but since a few unruly elements have caused disturbances, a clash was unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Congress Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Havas) – People close to the government say that President Hoover seems to have acknowledged the reasons presented in the British reply are very persuasive. However, many senators have stated that they will not change their stance. They have adopted a hostile attitude towards him, no different from their animosity towards Britain. Political figures here believe that the European debtor nations are insisting on delaying debt payments because President Hoover has secretly encouraged them. Hoover may even have corresponded with the debtor nations and made allowances without the knowledge of the U.S. Congress, which is also an unfounded accusation.</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Republican News Agency) – Speaker of the House Garner stated that although he knows that Congress will not approve the deferral of war debts, in his judgment, it is more beneficial in all respects for the United States to insist on payment. Garner's remarks are generally considered to represent the majority opinion in Congress, indicating that the attitude of members of both houses towards war debts remains unchanged. However, judging from Borah's words, there are also some in Congress who advocate for compromise, but their number is small.</p>
<h3>Retaliation by Britain is of No Benefit</h3>
<p>Warning from U.S. Senator</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Reuters) – Today, the U.S. Congress issued stern statements regarding the deferral of war debts. Senator Smoot said that if Britain imposes trade restrictions on the United States after paying its debts, then in his opinion, the victim would not be the United States, but Britain itself. Senator Harrison said that Britain's exaggerated talk of the possibility of disaster, its implied threats of actively managing exchange rates or increasing retaliatory plans, cannot change the United States' calm determination to oppose war debt cancellation or deferral.</p>
<h3>Defaulting on Debt is Dishonorable</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's Statement</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Reuters) – After Secretary of State Stimson and Treasury Secretary Mills conferred for several hours at the White House, a person said that we have not yet decided on the second step. It is expected that President Hoover's statement to Congress will be a reply to Britain and France. American newspapers are paying close attention to the British note, but they know that if Congress does not change its attitude, then there is ultimately nothing that can be done. The Christian Science Monitor said, "We will ultimately sell the world a sad image." The New York Times' Washington dispatch stated that those around President Hoover were greatly moved by the British note. A certain important figure said that if the authorities had constitutional authority and political power, then Britain would definitely win. The Christian Century stated that the British note can be regarded as being issued to public opinion, and the response of public sentiment must be awaited in silence. President-elect Roosevelt published an article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, stating that debts must be paid. All those with sound judgment should assist debtor nations in all aspects, but canceling debts is both impractical and dishonorable.</p>

<h3>Key Figures from Britain, America, and France Gather in Geneva to Reopen Disarmament Talks</h3>
<p>U.S. Deputy Representative Hopes the Conference Will Come to a Preliminary Conclusion</p>
<p>Suggests Drafting a Convention Based on Established Principles</p>
<p>To Be Signed by All Representatives, with a Small Group Established to Draft Detailed Rules</p>
<p>Complying with Germany's Demand for Equality</p>
<p>Preparing a So-Called Intermediate Plan</p>
<p>Geneva, 3rd (National News Agency) – After a private conversation this morning between the British and French Prime Ministers, the British Prime Minister met with the Italian representative Aloisi. It is rumored that this afternoon, the three will discuss disarmament issues with the U.S. representative Davis. Herriot is planning to leave Geneva next Tuesday, while MacDonald is expected to stay for a few more days.</p>
<p>Geneva, 3rd (National News Agency) – French Premier Herriot arrived here this morning and will meet with British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon this morning. The so-called intermediate plan to comply with Germany's demand for equality in armaments includes: 1) Allowing Germany to shorten the current term of service for its troops; 2) Allowing these troops to be reorganized according to new standards; 3) Establishing security forces to protect borders and maintain domestic security. At the same time, Germany agrees not to increase its army and navy budget within five years after signing the new disarmament convention. It is rumored that Germany, Italy, and Britain have already approved this plan, but France's attitude is still unclear. If MacDonald and Davis can persuade France to agree as well, it can ensure Germany's return to the disarmament conference and the success of the conference. This matter will likely be decided after German Foreign Minister Neurath arrives here early next week.</p>
<p>Geneva, 2nd (Havas) – Before the reopening of the disarmament conference, political talks have already begun today. However, all we know is that British Prime Minister MacDonald met with U.S. representative Davis in the morning and with French representative Paul-Boncour in the afternoon. According to the views of American personnel participating in the disarmament conference, the intention of the U.S. representative is to urgently seek a concrete result. The claim that they hope for the failure of disarmament is far from the truth. The U.S. side believes that the disarmament conference has reached the stage of drafting a preliminary convention because the disarmament conference has already passed several principles. Major countries can promote this convention based on them. As for the resolution adopted by the disarmament conference on July 23rd, it seems insufficient. All parties may immediately agree to first draft a treaty with a limited scope and important nature, without urgently seeking a complete solution to the issues of disarmament and security. American personnel hope that a preliminary result can be obtained before Christmas.</p>
<p>Geneva, 2nd (Reuters) – An American spokesperson here said today that the general public is becoming weary of the lack of progress at the Disarmament Conference. In order to stir up excitement, the United States has suggested that the methods agreed upon by the Disarmament Conference during its nine-month meeting be compiled into a convention to be signed by all sixty countries attending Geneva. As for the application of this treaty and the completion of detailed rules, they can be handled by the permanent supervisory committee. British Prime Minister MacDonald today initiated talks between the five major powers with U.S. representative Davis and French representative Paul-Boncour, which will determine whether the Disarmament Conference should adopt the American plan or proceed with a larger-scale process.</p>
<h3>List of New German Cabinet Members: Chancellor Schleicher Also Serves as Minister of Defense</h3>
<p>There are Proposals to Give Hitler a Deputy Chancellor Position</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (National News Agency) – This afternoon, new Chancellor General Schleicher submitted the list of cabinet members to the President. The contents have not yet been officially released. It is rumored that Schleicher will concurrently serve as Minister of Defense and Administrative Commissioner of Prussia. Count Krosigk will continue to serve as Minister of Finance, Baron von Rübenach will continue to serve as Minister of Transportation, Dr. Gürtner will serve as Minister of Justice, and Dr. Popitz will serve as Acting Administrative Commissioner of Prussia as a minister without portfolio. In the afternoon, the old cabinet held a meeting, followed by an informal meeting of the ministers remaining in office. It is expected that the new cabinet will be sworn in this afternoon and then immediately consider urgent issues related to Foreign Minister Neurath's trip to Geneva.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (National News Agency) – The new German Chancellor, General Schleicher, is currently fifty years old. He comes from one of the oldest families in Germany, known for their military achievements for generations. Therefore, Schleicher joined the army at the age of seventeen and rose through the ranks rapidly. At the age of forty-six, he had already reached the rank of general, which is the youngest general in German history. During the European War, Schleicher served in the Railway Department directly under the General Staff. After the war, he joined the National Defense Force and soon became the most trusted person of Defense Minister Groener. When the Brüning cabinet resigned, Schleicher was appointed Minister of Defense, having gained the trust of President Hindenburg. Although Schleicher held the position of Director of National Defense in the Papen cabinet, his actual importance exceeded his title because the National Socialist Party was gaining momentum and seeking to seize power by force. General Schleicher showed no weakness towards them, and Hitler's ambition ultimately failed to succeed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Reuters) – New Chancellor Schleicher is currently engaged in organizing a new cabinet. Schleicher intends to abandon former Chancellor Papen's plan to amend the constitution and abolish the wage reduction order opposed by the Social Democratic Party. This atmosphere of avoiding conflict with the parliament is considered good, and Schleicher is seen as an eccentric in German politics. The new chancellor, with the assistance of Dr. Luther of the German Bank, will draft a program on economy and unemployment. It is expected that this program can be agreed upon by all parties. Schleicher is also trying to win over Hitler of the National Socialist Party, possibly giving him the position of Deputy Chancellor. It is rumored that Schleicher's appointment as Chancellor was not what President Hindenburg wanted. The President still wanted Papen to govern, but Papen knew that some of the original cabinet members were unwilling to join his new cabinet, so he declined the position and recommended Schleicher to replace him, as he would be more compatible with the parliament. The new government will meet with the parliament on Tuesday, at which time the parliament may extend the session by one week to allow for negotiations between the party leaders.</p>
<h3>Indian Round Table Conference Discusses Defense Issues</h3>
<p>Governor-General Retains Administrative Privileges</p>
<p>Irwin's Remarks Face Criticism</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Reuters) – The Indian Round Table Conference has resolved constitutional issues such as suffrage. The second week of consideration is largely focused on the central government assuming responsibility from the beginning to the completion of self-government, and the safeguards during the transition period. Former Viceroy Irwin expressed the British government's opinion, stating that in addition to managing national defense and foreign relations, the Governor-General should have the power to find ways to maintain peace, protect minorities, protect the rights of the Indian states, and protect relations with other parts of the British Empire. After three days of debate, Indian Secretary of State Hoare, representing the government, explained that these privileges should be implemented in a limited manner to avoid hindering responsibility. There was much criticism of the layer protecting the British Empire's relations. Hoare claimed that this did not mean that the Governor-General could interfere in normal times between the Indian government and other self-governing governments, but that the protection would only be used when relations were tense and jeopardized the integrity of the Empire's government. Now that there is opposition, he will reconsider it. Hoare concluded with an optimistic statement, saying that there is more hope now than at the beginning of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Persia Celebrates the Recovery of Oil Rights</h3>
<p>Russian Newspaper Praises It as a Courageous Act</p>
<p>Tehran, 2nd (Reuters) – The Persian government's cancellation of the D'Arcy oil concession has been approved by the parliament today. The city is still celebrating this move. All shops are decorated with lights and lanterns. People are riding in vehicles through the city in teams, singing along the way. All theaters are free of charge. Other cities in Persia have also held celebrations upon receiving the news. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has announced that it is currently drafting a report to be submitted to shareholders and will be published soon. It is noted that the Persian government announced the cancellation of this concession on November 30 because it was granted before Persia had a constitutional government, so its terms should be renegotiated, but the Anglo-Persian Oil Company ignored it. The British authorities are now paying close attention to this matter because the British hold a large number of shares in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and because its oil is supplied to the British Navy.</p>
<p>Moscow, 2nd (TASS) – The Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" stated in an editorial today that the Persian government's cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession is a major political event. The newspaper briefly described how the Persian government opposed the company's use of special accounting methods to reduce paper profits, preventing the Persian government from obtaining its share as stipulated in the agreement, referring to this method as "one of the most sinister forms of imperialist colonial plunder." It also said that the solution to this problem must be found outside of legal methods because this move is a political event. The British government will not only use its position in the world oil industry, but will also use all the political and military power of the Empire to overwhelm the Persian government. Therefore, the Persian government's recovery of oil rights can be described as an act of great courage. The newspaper concluded that "The Persian government's daring to take this action is also because the British Empire has lost its world leadership position under the world economic panic. No matter what the outcome of future negotiations, this move shows a sign of the breakdown of British colonial policy, and its impact on Eastern countries will further shake the foundation of the British Empire."</p>
<h3>Italy and Japan Build New Warships Amid Disarmament Talks</h3>
<p>Rome, 2nd (Reuters) – Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has ordered the construction of two new cruisers, each weighing 7,000 tons, and two torpedo boats. This is part of the 30,000-ton warship construction program for 1932-33 approved by the Italian government this summer.</p>
<p>Yokosuka, 3rd (Den-tsu) – The first-class destroyer "Nenohi" (1,200 tons), which is being built at the Uraga Dock, is nearing completion. The Yokosuka Naval District Commander will be present on the 22nd to hold a grand launching ceremony.</p>
<h3>War Damage Suffered by the People of Sichuan</h3>
<p>Battles in Jiangjin, Luzhou, Zizhong, and Chengdu</p>
<p>More than 3,000 Innocent People Died</p>
<p>Commercial Losses in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Various Counties in the War Zone Total Approximately 70 Million</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence - Two months have passed since the outbreak of the Sichuan war. The generally brave and combative warlords are now exhausted, with both men and horses panting, and the intensity is not as great as before. There is a general feeling that this may come to an end and a temporary ceasefire may be called. As a result, there has been a glimmer of hope in the vast future of the Sichuan situation, and the call for peace is rising. However, the spring spirit is just beginning to unfold, and changes are unpredictable. It is still impossible to predict what the future situation will be. However, it is necessary to describe the conditions of the various armies after the war and the suffering endured by the common people. In this Sichuan war, the Allied forces had a large momentum and would naturally gain the upper hand. However, the losses were also quite significant. Taking Liu Xiang's 21st Army, which is said to have land, sea, and air power, as an example, the number of soldiers who died was very large. In total, there were five regimental commanders, fifteen battalion commanders, and more than one hundred company and platoon commanders. More than 11,000 soldiers were wounded or killed. Two aircraft were destroyed, and two warships were destroyed. Military spending amounted to about 8 million. The benefits gained were the incorporation of Deng Guozhang's independent brigade, Tian Guanwu's fourth brigade, Yang Shangyuan's fifth brigade of the 24th Army, and Hou Zhi's Qian army division, totaling about 15,000 people. In addition, it seized 20 counties from the 24th Army, including Jiangjin, Yongchuan, Dazu, Jinan, Rongchang, Longchang, Neijiang, Fushun, Luxian, Xuyong, Weiyuan, Hejiang, Naxi, Nanxi, Gusong, Gulan, Jianwei, Yangxian, Rongxian, and Jiang'an. Among them, Fushun's salt well tax, which reaches 40 to 50 million yuan per year, is jointly extracted by Liu and the Allied forces and is the most prosperous. As for Yang Sen, the commander of the 20th Army of the Allied forces, Li Jiayu of the New Sixth Division, and Luo Zezhou of the 23rd Division, they jointly attacked the 24th Army, occupied Shunqing, and reached Jianyang. A total of four regimental commanders, thirty-eight battalion, company, and platoon commanders, and more than 2,500 soldiers died. They incorporated about ten companies from Liu Wenhui's troops and occupied six counties in the 24th Army's defense area: Shunqing, Suining, Anyue, Lezhi, Lanyang, and Zizhong. As for Tian Songyao of the 29th Army and Deng Xihou of the 28th Army from the provincial side, after joining the war, they fiercely attacked Liu Wenhui in the Chengdu area, resulting in unprecedented street fighting. About 2,700 people were killed in the two departments. Diao Wenjun, the brigade commander of Deng's department, was also killed.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Killed. Many state-owned company and platoon commanders died. Deng occupied Liu Wenhui's defense area, including Chongqing, Shuangliu, and Renshou counties. Deng and Tian both withdrew from Chengdu. Tian even lost the arsenal. In the Allied forces, they were considered to have suffered a significant loss. In addition, the Sichuan army without benefits and losses was only Liu Cunhou's part of the Sichuan-Shaanxi army. Liu is the oldest in qualifications among Sichuan military officers. This time, he joined the anti-Liu campaign as a figurehead of the Allied forces. As for the 24th Army of Liu Wenhui, which was surrounded by enemies and suffered the greatest losses, having lost more than 20 counties of defense area and wasted more than 25,000 troops, they are still strong and unwilling to submit, and have the intention of making a desperate bet to determine the final victory. Currently, Deputy Commander Xiang Yuren is promoting the old tune of the Baoding system unity, and Deng, Tian, and Liu are still cooperating and are brewing in progress. Whether it can be successful is still a question. The losses of the Allied and Liu's forces in this war were limited. The most affected were the common people. In the Jiangjin campaign, the 21st Army bombed Liu Wenhui's troops. Aircraft dropped bombs in the city, killing more than 200 civilians. The Luzhou campaign was even bigger, with more than 1,000 people killed. In the Zizhong campaign, 200 to 300 people also died. The Chengdu area was even bigger. In the Meishan campaign, 700 to 800 people died. In total, no less than 3,000 people died. According to commercial investigations, the commercial losses in Chengdu, Chongqing, and various counties in the war zone affected by the war totaled more than 70 million. I do not know why the Sichuan warlords would bestow this gift on the people. (November 30)</p>
<h3>Investigation of Mao and Wang's Power in the Guizhou Crisis</h3>
<p>Guizhou's Military Strength Totals Approximately 30,000</p>
<p>Half Supporting Mao, Half Supporting Wang</p>
<p>Victory or Defeat Depends on Reinforcements</p>
<p>Chongqing Air Dispatch: Since the battle between Guizhou Province and Xicheng and Li Yao, more than a year has passed, and the elite troops of each department have been almost completely lost. After Zhou's death, Mao Guangxiang succeeded Zhou Wan in both military and civil administration. The total military strength of the province is four divisions and three independent brigades, including Mao Guangxiang, the commander of the 25th Army and concurrent director of the Training Division; Wang Jialie, the commander of the First Division and concurrent deputy army commander; You Guocai, the commander of the Second Division; Jiang Zaizhen, the commander of the Third Division; Hou Zidan, the commander of the First Independent Brigade; Che Mingyi, the commander of the Second Independent Brigade; and Yi Huaizhi, the commander of the Third Independent Brigade. Mao is stationed in Guiyang, Wang is stationed in Hongjiang in western Hunan, You is stationed in Anshun in the western district, Jiang is stationed in Zunyi in the northern district, Hou is stationed in Chishui in the northern district, Yi is stationed in Bijie in the western district, and Che is stationed in Tongren in the eastern district. Last year, Wang Jialie returned to Guizhou from Hunan and forced Mao to step down. He then greatly reorganized his troops. In addition to the original military strength, he also expanded his troops with 4,000 German rifles obtained from the central government. Wang Jialie now serves as the commander of the 25th Army and concurrently as the director of the Training Division; He Zhizhong is the commander of the First Division; You Guocai is the commander of the Second Division and concurrent deputy army commander; Jiang Zaizhen is the commander of the Third Division; Hou Zidan is the commander of the Fourth Division; Che Mingyi is the commander of the Fifth Division; Song Xing is the commander of the First Independent Brigade; Lan Wenbo is the commander of the Second Independent Brigade; Li Chengzhang is the commander of the Third Independent Brigade; and You Yujiu is the commander of the Fourth Independent Brigade. As for the current locations of each army, Wang Jialie is stationed in Guiyang with approximately three regiments of the Training Division, equipped with 4,000 rifles. The head of the military officer training regiment is Wang himself, with more than 1,300 students and 1,300 rifles. The military police battalion has more than 500 men and rifles, and the guard battalion has 500 men, including a pistol company, a "hook hook" rifle company, a light machine gun company, and a carbine company. The Special Forces Training Center has an artillery battalion with 16 field guns, 600 rifles, and 36 machine guns. He Zhizhong is stationed in Xiangjiang with three regiments and approximately 3,500 men and rifles. You Guocai, commander of the Second Division, is stationed in Anshun, Guizhou, with three regiments and approximately 3,300 men and rifles. Jiang Zaizhen, commander of the Third Division, is stationed in Zunyi, northern Guizhou, with two regiments and another battalion, totaling over 1,500 men and rifles. Jiang has also incorporated bandits from Sichuan and Guizhou, totaling approximately 1,000 men and rifles, led by Li Derong, Yang Qichang, and Shuangqing. Hou Zidan, commander of the Fourth Division, is stationed in Chishui, northern Guizhou, and currently serves as the commander of the 21st Army of the Sichuan-Guizhou Border Defense, with three regiments and approximately 3,000 men and rifles. Che Mingyi, commander of the Fifth Division, is stationed in Tongren, eastern Guizhou, with three regiments and approximately 2,000 men and rifles. Song Xing, commander of the First Independent Brigade, is stationed in Bijie, western Guizhou, with two regiments and approximately 2,000 men and rifles. Jian Wenbo, commander of the Second Independent Brigade, has three regiments with approximately 1,000 men and rifles and is currently stationed in northern Guizhou. Li Chengzhang, commander of the Third Independent Brigade, has two regiments stationed in Guiyang with over 1,600 men and rifles. You Yujiu, commander of the Fourth Independent Brigade, is stationed in Guiyang with two regiments and approximately 1,500 men and rifles. In recent days, Wang Jialie has felt uneasy because of the strong influence of You, Hou, Jiang, Che, and others, who are not directly under his command. Although Mao Guangxiang nominally holds the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Eighteen Routes after stepping down, You, Jiang, and others are quite close to him. Wang is deeply afraid of a joint action against him and will be difficult to deal with. Therefore, he advocated that military expenditures are insufficient and that the troops must be reduced in size, uniformly abolishing divisions and turning them into brigades, in order to reduce the strength of Jiang and others. You, Jiang, and others have long been dissatisfied with Wang's preferential treatment of troops directly under his command. After the plan to reduce troops was leaked, it aroused strong opposition. Mao Guangxiang seized the opportunity to vigorously incite the generals, who had excellent personal relations with Mao. Naturally, they hit it off, leading to the current scene of supporting Mao and overthrowing Wang. The generals of the Mao faction are You Guocai, Hou Zidan, Jiang Zaizhen, Che Mingyi, Song Xing, You Yujiu, etc., with a total of approximately 15,000 troops. The rest who support Wang include He Zhizhong, Li Chengzhang, Jian Fangbo, the Training Division, and the Military Officer Training Regiment, with approximately 14,000 troops. The strength of both sides is equal, but Mao Guangxiang has stronger reinforcements. Jiang Zaizhen, commander of the Third Division, who most strongly supports Mao, took the lead in Zunyi, deploying troops on the Wujiang River to threaten Wang and sending the Zhang Binglin regiment of that division to attack the Lan Wenbo brigade of Wang's army. Fierce battles took place between the two sides on the 18th and 19th in Xinchang, Matashi, Shuangchongyan, and other places near the Wujiang River. Che Mingyi's division also moved from Tongren and has arrived in Meitan. As for You Guocai, he led his troops straight to Guiyang on the 26th. Wang Jialie was caught off guard and withdrew in a hurry, concentrating near Guiyang. After You entered Guiyang, he sent a telegram to welcome Mao back to office. Mao also set off from Zunyi to go to Guiyang. The Guizhou coup seems to have come to an end on the surface, but Wang Jialie's strength has not been significantly depleted and still concentrates near the provincial capital. It is feared that war will still be difficult to avoid. (November 30th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Sends Personnel to Investigate and Prohibit Opium Cultivation in Ten Provinces</h3>
<p>Measures are Formulated and Submitted to the National Government for Filing</p>
<p>And Ordered the Chairmen of the Ten Provincial Governments to Comply</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: In order to strictly prohibit opium and eradicate poisonous plants, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek decided to send personnel to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Shaanxi, and Gansu to supervise and prohibit opium cultivation. He also formulated nine articles of the "Measures for Sending Personnel to Investigate and Prohibit Opium Cultivation in Ten Provinces," which were submitted to the National Government for filing on December 1, and telegraphed to the chairmen of the above-mentioned provincial governments to comply. The original submission and measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>The harm of opium is the most severe, and it has been strictly prohibited for years. In recent years, the provinces have followed each other, privately planting it, and there is no way to control it. Poisonous plants are everywhere, and provinces that did not previously cultivate opium, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Henan, also have it everywhere, and it is spreading more and more. This year, while I, Chiang Kai-shek, was leading troops to suppress bandits and going up the Yangtze River, what I saw and heard made me feel even more heartbroken. The reason for this is that a few soldiers and officials have condoned and sheltered it, which is undeniable. As for evil people and treacherous merchants, who are greedy for profit and forget righteousness, they privately traffic and sell opium, and even transform it into morphine and other anesthetic products, making red and white poisonous pills and secretly selling them throughout the country. If we do not seek a fundamental way to eradicate it, there will be a lot of hard work in allowing it to grow. I have now formulated nine articles of the Measures for Sending Personnel to Investigate and Prohibit Opium Cultivation in Ten Provinces. I will select capable personnel and send them to various provinces to supervise the local military and civilian leaders in strictly investigating and prohibiting opium cultivation, starting with the provinces in the interior to eradicate the roots of poisonous plants, and then moving on to others. All the formulated Measures for Sending Personnel to Investigate and Prohibit Opium Cultivation in Ten Provinces, and the reasons for sending personnel to supervise and investigate, are hereby submitted to the National Government for review and filing. This submission is made to the National Government.</p>
<h3>Measures</h3>
<p>Respectfully presented to the chairmen of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Shaanxi, and Gansu: The Measures for Sending Personnel to Investigate and Prohibit Opium Cultivation in Ten Provinces are hereby formulated. (Article 1) The ten provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Shaanxi, and Gansu should first prohibit the cultivation of opium, which shall be the responsibility of the military and civilian leaders of each province. In order to promote efficiency, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission shall appoint a special commissioner for investigation and prohibition and a number of commissioners for prohibition to go to each province to supervise and prohibit opium cultivation. For the convenience of handling affairs, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission may directly appoint the aforementioned personnel from the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, which he concurrently leads. (Article 2) The investigation and prohibition shall be divided into two phases. The first phase shall be when planting is approaching, and the second phase shall be when the opium seedlings emerge from the soil. At that time, the special commissioner for investigation and prohibition shall, together with the provincial government, select commissioners or committee members to go to each county with opium seedlings to earnestly handle the matter. (Article 3) When the first phase, when planting is approaching, each county with opium shall send one committee member, or several counties shall send one committee member. Their tasks are as follows: (1) Together with the county government, supervise the heads of each district, township, and village and the heads of the Baojia system to carefully investigate within their jurisdiction. If poppy seeds are found, they shall be confiscated immediately. Those who plant them and refuse to comply shall be detained and sent to be dealt with according to the law. (2) Together with the county government and local party departments, legal groups, etc., carry out publicity and lectures in the public offices of each district, town, and township to enable the people to understand the harm of opium and the severity of national laws, and to voluntarily switch to planting food crops. (3) After the committee members have completed the inspection in the county, they shall, together with the county magistrate, summon all the heads of each district, township, and village and the heads of the Baojia system, and instruct them to personally go to or send people to patrol within their jurisdiction at any time, and order them to submit a written guarantee that opium seedlings will never be found in the future. (Article 4) When the second phase, when opium seedlings emerge from the soil, each county with opium seedlings shall send one committee member. Their tasks are as follows: (1) Together with the county magistrate, personally go to each township for spot checks and supervise the heads of each district, township, and village and the heads of the Baojia system to carefully inspect. If opium seedlings are found, they shall be eradicated immediately, and the planters shall be detained and sent to be dealt with according to the law. (2) If the people in the bandit areas are accustomed to their old habits and greedily plant opium, which cannot be reached by the heads of the district, township, and village and the heads of the Baojia system, they shall consult with the county magistrate and ask the troops stationed in the county to lead the police and other teams to eradicate the opium, but they shall not use this as an excuse to cause trouble. (3) Remote areas are prone to secret planting, and the heads of the district, township, and village and the heads of the Baojia system are not completely honest. They must be diligently investigated, and more attention must be paid to the concealment by the heads of the district, township, and village and the heads of the Baojia system. (Article 5) The committee members shall report the investigation and prohibition situation to the provincial government and the special commissioner for investigation and prohibition once every ten days. (Article 6) If the troops stationed in each county and the local gentry dare to protect opium cultivation, causing the county magistrate to be unable to perform his duties and the committee members to be unable to complete their tasks, the committee members shall secretly report to the special commissioner for investigation and prohibition, who shall consult with the military and civilian leaders of the province to investigate and deal with them strictly according to the law. If the circumstances are serious, the special commissioner for investigation and prohibition may report to the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission for review. (Article 7) The special commissioner for investigation and prohibition shall investigate the situation in each county at any time. If there are places where private planting has been prevalent for years and where the customs are strong and the people are not afraid of the law, he shall designate commissioners or go there himself to handle the matter. (Article 8) If the military and civilian leaders of each province and the county magistrates of each county dare to neglect the matter of prohibiting opium cultivation or openly disobey and secretly condone it, the special commissioner for investigation and prohibition shall secretly report to the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission for review and strict punishment. If the special commissioner for investigation and prohibition and the commissioners for prohibition fail to carry out the investigation and prohibition effectively, intentionally perfunctorily, or report untruthfully, they shall be severely punished once they are found out. (Article 9) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. Seal of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression of the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces. (December 1)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Troops Repel Communist Bandits on the Fujian Border</h3>
<p>Communist Bandits Invading Wuping Were Defeated by the Huang Division</p>
<p>The Communist Bandits Did Not Dare to Invade Xinfeng Because of Strong Military Strength</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, the troops of various routes in Guangdong have been searching for Communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi. However, the Communist bandits have recently disintegrated into smaller units and are operating in various places in southeastern and western Jiangxi, attacking where the defense troops are lax. Near Anyuan, hundreds of Communist bandits were recently discovered at Wangmu Ferry, planning to attack the county seat of Xinfeng. The local defense troops of the Wang Zanbin Division immediately prepared for defense and telegraphed friendly troops for reinforcements. Therefore, there were rumors that the Guangxi troops would transfer the Zhou Zuhuang Division to Xinfeng, but this has not yet been implemented, presumably because the issues of military pay and transit have not yet been resolved. Although the Guangxi troops have not moved at this time, for the sake of mutual dependence, the Guangdong troops in southern Jiangxi have dispatched two routes to assist in the defense near Xinfeng. A part of the Fourth Division of the Second Army of San'nan has gone north, and the Second Division of the First Army has also come east from Nankang. The Third Independent Division has come from Nanxiong to Wuqing and other places, so the area of Xinfeng is still safe at this time. The Communist bandits, seeing that Xinfeng has superior military strength, changed their plans and fled back to eastern Jiangxi to attack Shanghang and Wuping on the Fujian border. On the 23rd of this month, more than 300 bandits invaded the county seat of Wuping. Upon receiving the report, the Guangdong troops of the First Independent Division immediately sent the Huang Battalion of the Fifth Regiment to intercept them, killing and wounding many Communist bandits and seizing many red flags. Yesterday, Division Commander Huang telegraphed a report on the defeat of the bandits as follows: "At dawn on the 23rd, the Huang Battalion Commander Dao Ren of the Fifth Regiment was dispatched to lead a team to guerrilla in Shanghang and other places. At Shuikou, Shanghang, they encountered the Luo Guibo and Lai Qinghu units of the pseudo-Independent Third Division and the pseudo-Guerrilla Team, with approximately 300 Communist bandits and two water-cooled machine guns. The bandits resisted from a high position. After fighting for about two hours, the bandits were unable to withstand it and fled in disarray towards Wu She and Chizhu Ridge. We immediately pursued them. By the time we reached Lei Ren She, it was already late and the mountain roads were rugged, so we had to lead the team back to Shanghang for the night. It was found that the bandits had planned to attack the county seat of Wuping, but they were severely suppressed by us. It is estimated that in this battle, more than ten bandits were killed and more than twenty were wounded. We continued to search and suppress the bandits in Chizhu Ridge and Longxi on the morning of the 24th. Further details will be reported later. Respectfully submitted by Huang Renhuan."

<h3>Large Drug Manufacturing Organization Uncovered in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Those in Charge of Drug Manufacturing Were All Well-Known People</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters Telegraphed Directly to Nanking to Arrest Them on the Spot</p>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: In recent years, the ban on opium has been lax in Xuzhou. After the Garrison Commander Li Yannian was stationed in Xuzhou, he vigorously enforced the ban on opium. Recently, a heroin manufacturing organization was uncovered, and many principals were arrested, which has attracted much attention in society. It turned out that Zhang Qiong, the commander of the 52nd Regiment of the Ninth Division, set off to suppress bandits in western Xuzhou last month. When he returned, he received a report from the locals that Zhang Jishun, a local bully near Huangkou, Zhangjiazhai, was manufacturing a large amount of heroin at home and selling it in the Xuzhou area. Regiment Commander Zhang was extremely strict in rejecting drugs in accordance with military orders.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>He immediately sent two companies of the Fifth Battalion Commander Wu Kuan to Zhangjiazhai on the 8th to search. On the spot, 110 taels of manufactured heroin, 42 taels of opium, and machinery were seized. At the same time, the principals Zhang Jishun, Wang Xijiu, Quan Shi Jiang Nianqing, and Lu Xianfu, and the suspects Gao Yongde, Zhang Benshu, Meng Xianen, Yue Cunmu, and Zhang Jixun were arrested. Three rifles were also seized. Regiment Commander Zhang immediately escorted all the criminals to Xuzhou and sent them to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. After further interrogation, they confessed that the shareholders participating in this drug manufacturing were Zhang Jixun, Wang Xijiu, Ding Yinzhou, Liu Bingchen, Jiang Zhan Kui, Wen Shao Shan, Zhu Zi He, Zhou Jing Chang, Cao Zi Ting, and He Zi Lan. However, except for Zhang and Wang, who were arrested, most of the others were well-known people in Xuzhou. Ding Yinzhou is the chairman of the Grain and Rice Industry Association, Liu Bingchen is the former magistrate of Tongshan County, Cao Ziting is the chairman of the Charity Association, and Jiang, Wen, Zhu, Zhou, etc. are all big merchants. He Lan is from Shanghai, and her occupation is unknown. For the sake of caution, the Garrison Headquarters did not reveal any information and telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. They received a telegram ordering them to arrest them on the spot. The Garrison Headquarters then acted on the 3rd of last month.</p>
<h3>Han Traitor Yu Chonghan Assassinated</h3>
<p>Assassinated While Under the Strict Guard of Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>The Assassin Was a Puppet Official Who Has Not Yet Been Apprehended</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Chaotic Situation in the Puppet State</p>
<p>The World Society translates the Miller Review as saying that the infighting and conspiracies within the Japanese puppet "Manchukuo" have been confirmed by the assassination of Yu Chonghan (pseudo-President of the Privy Council). Regarding this matter, some small newspapers in Shanghai have mentioned it briefly, but no details have been announced elsewhere in the Far East. The only record of this assassination case appears to be in the October 24th issue of the New York Times Magazine. Although the names recorded in that magazine are not accurate, the details of the case are apparently correct, as a reader of the Miller Review living in Dalian has now sent a similar report on the case. It is not known where the New York Times Magazine got this information, but the name of the restaurant where the case occurred is apparently mixed up with the name of the victim, Yu Chonghan. According to the magazine, Yu Chonghan was eating in a Chinese restaurant in the Japanese railway district of Changchun, heavily guarded by Japanese police. Suddenly, another official of the puppet Privy Council named Li Yisheng (transliteration) broke in. Li had apparently once served as the Civil Affairs Director of Heilongjiang Province, but was later dismissed. The magazine's account also mentions another official from Qiqihar named Cheng Zhiyuan (transliteration, according to the report, Cheng was shot by General Tamon, commander of the 2nd Japanese Division; yesterday's news said that Cheng was a pseudo-acting governor of Heilongjiang Province), who was said to have been dismissed due to Yu Chonghan's conspiracy. Therefore, it is not clear who masterminded this case. What is known is that Yu Chonghan, a high-ranking official of "Manchukuo" serving under the Japanese, was assassinated, and the assassin was another Chinese official, who has not yet been arrested or brought to justice. As mentioned earlier, Yu was eating in a restaurant under the protection of Japanese guards when another Chinese official broke in (seized a butcher knife used in the kitchen, and stabbed Yu in the head and neck in multiple places). Yu later died of his injuries in the Mantetsu Hospital in Dalian on November 1. At the time, the assassin, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, simply walked out of the restaurant and into another restaurant to eat. The Japanese police authorities turned a blind eye and did not arrest him. Since then, the case has been issued by the Japanese authorities to immediately implement censorship, so the matter was not recorded in newspapers in Manchuria and Japan. Only the English-language Japanese Record newspaper (run by the British, carried only briefly, and did not mention his name, but speculated that the murderer will be subject to legal punishment, is the only account), even the news of Yu's death in a Dalian hospital was censored, so the news released by the United Press of America from a Japanese telegram also contains mixed messages.</p>
<p>The assassination of Yu Chonghan and the failure of the Japanese to bring Yu's murderer to justice provide us with an interesting glimpse into the current situation in the puppet capital. A foreigner familiar with world affairs who recently traveled to Changchun claimed that, in his view, the current state of the capital of "Manchukuo" is unlike that of any other capital in the world. The Japanese's promotion of "Manchukuo" as "solid" is contrary to reality. The Japanese never trust anyone. Any Chinese official working with the Japanese is at risk of being assassinated. After the September 18th Incident in Shenyang last year, Yuan Jinkai, who helped the Japanese organize the Shenyang Public Security Maintenance Association, told the League of Nations Investigation Commission that he was in danger of being assassinated and was constantly under the surveillance of Japanese military police. Therefore, Yu Chonghan's assassination is all the more illustrative of how chaotic and dark the situation is in "Manchukuo" under Japanese control.</p>
<p>On the night of the 10th, the team was dispatched to search the homes and shops of the above-mentioned criminals. It turned out that after the manufacturing site in Zhangjiazhai was uncovered, some of the criminals had already absconded. As a result, Cao Ziting and Jiang Zhankui were arrested. Cao Huiwu and Zhou Wangshi were arrested at Zhou Jingchang's home. Wen Zichengxiang, Wen Shishi, and Wen Zhangshi were arrested at Wen Shaoshan's home. Ding Zizhaofeng and the suspect Zhou Yuhan were arrested at Ding Yinzhou's business. Wang Ruiqin, a partner of the Daguanyuan, was also arrested. The others had already fled far away. These criminals were all escorted to the Garrison Headquarters and questioned separately. The Garrison Headquarters is still considering how to handle this case, and there are probably two options: one is to present a request for execution by shooting in accordance with military law, and the other is to publicly impose a heavy fine and use the funds for local public welfare. It is also planned to solicit local opinions to make a decision. It is also heard that this drug manufacturing organization was initially established in the station area, in the home of a certain criminal, and moved several times, eventually reaching Zhangjiazhai. One drug manufacturing machine was destroyed at the time, and the remaining are now stored in the Garrison Headquarters. Criminal Cao already has white hair and a silver beard, and is over sixty years old. The other criminals are also quite wealthy, but they still engaged in this illegal act, which must be severely punished. (December 2)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Bran Cake Industry Asks for Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Songjiang Fengjing Town Bran Cake and Bean Cake Industry Association, because the Department of Finance collects business tax in accordance with the grain tax, which is unbearable, has telegraphed again to the Department of Finance to request a reduction. The original telegram is as follows: "Respectfully presented to Director Shu of the Zhenjiang Department of Finance. Regarding the request to exempt the bran cake industry from increasing business tax, it has been telegraphed to your office some days ago. Now, we have received a reply stating that, upon reviewing the temporary regulations on business tax in Jiangsu Province, the grain industry in the attached tax rate table is subject to business tax at a reduced tax rate of 0.5%. Since the bran cake industry is a kind of grain, it should be taxed at the grain industry tax rate without any doubt. As for rice and flour, which are the main products in grain, the government has made a special accommodation for the sake of emphasizing people's livelihood, and the temporary tax rate is still 0.2%. No other industries may cite this as an example. The request that the bran cake industry maintain the original tax amount should not be granted. Upon receiving this, we found that the two words 'grain' refer to those that can be eaten, such as rice, millet, sorghum, wheat, etc. The grain tax certificates issued by your department over the years have also not included the bran cake industry. It is very obvious that bran cake should not be considered a kind of grain. The reply stating that the bran cake industry is a kind of grain is purely a misunderstanding. Moreover, bran cake is a necessary item for farmers' cultivation. Without bran cake, even if they can cultivate, how can the fields be fertile? If the fields are not fertile, how can there be a harvest? If there is no harvest, it will inevitably affect people's livelihood. The situation is important and more urgent than rice and flour among grains. The tax rate should be even lower than the tax rate of rice and flour among grains, in order to comply with the government's intention to take care of people's livelihood. We humbly implore your department to consider the decline in commerce and the suffering of people's livelihood, maintain the original tax, and do not increase it. We await your orders with utmost anxiety. respectfully submitted by the Songjiang Fengjing Town Bran Cake and Bean Cake Industry Association."</p>
<h3>Ministry's Approval of the Case of Boundary Demarcation Between Fengxian and Fengnan</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of boundary demarcation between Fengnan, the standing committee member of the county party department, Jiang Wenhe, submitted to the Ministry of Interior a reply stating: "According to the Chief of the Civil Affairs Department of this ministry, the special commissioner for inspecting local administration and local autonomy in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, Wang Xianqiang, signed a report stating that the committee member and others had submitted a request to transfer the 15 townships including Taiping in Nanhui County to the jurisdiction of Fengxian County. This ministry has transferred it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the Department of Civil Affairs to earnestly sort out the intermingled land sections between Fengxian and Nanhui counties in accordance with the ministry's regulations and report it to the ministry for review. Inform the committee member of this approval."</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Cases Occur in Two Townships, Chu and Chen</h3>
<p>East of Jinhui Bridge in the county, Zhang Zitang, a villager in Chujia Bang Township, was having dinner at home on the night of the 28th of last month when more than ten masked bandits speaking the local dialect suddenly came and kidnapped him. However, at that time, the public security agency temporarily kept silent for the sake of facilitating the arrest. Unexpectedly, in the nearby Chenjia Township, the grandson of Chen Chunjian, a wealthy household, the monk (16 years old), was kidnapped by bandits on the way back from visiting relatives at his wife's home the day before yesterday (the 1st), and his whereabouts are still unknown. Therefore, in addition to ordering the Winter Flood Prevention Land and Water Inspection Headquarters to solve the case within two weeks, the county government also reported it to the relevant authorities in charge yesterday and handled the case together.</p>

<h3>Township Chief's Deputy Assaults and Arrests Party Members</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the first branch of the second district of Jiang Township in this county convened a meeting of party members to elect provincial representatives. Zhen Xizuo was dispatched by the county executive committee to supervise the election. Party members Zhu Guangdi, Du Jiping, Chen Yifei, and others attended the meeting. As they approached the sandy dock, Lu Hongchang, the Jiang Township Chief, and Huang Mingjiang, the deputy of the training class of the County Security Corps, suddenly led five or six armed patrolmen from the Panjiaqiao Public Security Bureau branch and more than ten members of the Security Corps, each carrying live ammunition in their magazine rifles. Without explanation, they brutally beat Zhu and the others before tying them up and taking them away. County Supervisory Committee member Zhu Baozhong happened to pass by while investigating a case in the countryside. The party members appealed to him, and he advised the township chief and others to release them voluntarily. Unexpectedly, his advice was rejected. Subsequently, the county police team arrived upon hearing the news and did their best to persuade them, finally leading to the release of Zhu and the others. It is reported that the three have hired a boat to come to the city to report the injuries to the county government and demand an investigation. Suzhou</p>
<h3>Red Pill Ringleader Escorted to Province for Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Shengjia Port case involved a false alarm of fire and robbery caused by someone triggering the Red Pill mechanism, resulting in a tragic incident where patrol officers and policemen shot and killed four people. The local court has already announced the verdict on both the Red Pill offender and the policemen involved. The Civil Affairs Department has also sent personnel to Suzhou once to investigate. Yesterday (2nd), an order was issued to the Wu County government to escort the Red Pill mechanism ringleader Guo Xianglin and accomplice Zhao Yitai to the province for interrogation without delay.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Regarding Insult to Firefighters</h3>
<p>The North Third, East Second, and other fire brigades in Suzhou City believe that the model of a water pump truck displayed in the window of Wang Ruiyu Tea Shop on Guanqian Street, with a small dog pulling the cart and a small monkey cranking the vehicle, is an insult to firefighters. They immediately reported to the district, which sent the model to the district for handling. The fire brigade side believes that the model displayed by Wang Ruiyu is of a playful nature and does not constitute intentional insult. Therefore, no action was taken, which aroused dissatisfaction from the Chang District and other fire brigades. Yesterday, they submitted a report to the Fire Brigade Joint Association, proposing four measures: (1) fine, (2) apology, (3) confiscation, (4) well opening. The Joint Association will convene a general meeting in the coming days to discuss the measures.</p>
<h3>Xu Yabo's Request for Bail Rejected</h3>
<p>Xu Yabo, the former chief of the first district of the Provincial Water Police, appealed to the Suzhou High Court regarding the crime of suspected robbery. The result of the reversal was a dismissal. Yesterday (3rd), High Court Prosecutor Ren Guanghai believed that Xu's case was serious and that the court's handling was improper. He has filed a third appeal to the High Court. At the same time, Xu, claiming to be ill while in custody, and Xu's brother Shengbo, claiming their mother was ill, repeatedly submitted reports to the High Court's criminal division, requesting that Xu's detention be suspended. The criminal division, based on the report, believes that continued detention is still necessary in accordance with Article 66 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Yesterday (3rd), the request was rejected.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>Deadline for All Industries to Switch to Standard Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The county government's weights and measures inspectors, in order to actively promote the new system, have repeatedly convened meetings of various industries to discuss the cessation of the old system and the implementation of the new one within a set deadline. The silk and foreign goods shops in this county have agreed to switch to the new ruler starting from the first day of this month. Yesterday, the county government summoned Chen Jinli and representatives from more than ten other industries to the county for a discussion meeting to discuss the date of switching to the new instruments. Section Chief Wang reported on the necessity of switching to the new instruments. All the representatives present unanimously agreed and decided to implement it by the end of December.</p>
<h3>Red Pills Permeate Various Counties in Huaihai</h3>
<p>The area north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province is located in a remote area, and the folk customs are still considered simple and honest. Social evils are self-disciplined and strict. However, in recent years, opium has deeply penetrated the people, and Red Pills, which are a hundred times more harmful than opium, have also gradually spread to various counties in Huaihai. According to investigations, the total value of Red Pills imported into various counties in Huaihai each year has reached more than 5 million yuan. The authorities' eyes and ears are not comprehensive, and prohibitions are ineffective. Smokers smoke, vendors sell, and manufacturers produce without any scruples. Red Pills have deeply penetrated the people in northern Jiangsu, causing endless harm. According to recent investigations, in each larger village and town in the Huaihai counties, more than ten yuan worth of Red Pills can be sold per day. Based on ten villages per district, more than one hundred yuan can be sold per day. This refers to the general laborers, coolies, and vagrants in society. The wealthy sons and daughters, who have larger addictions and smoke four or five to seven or eight yuan a day, are not included. In summary, the sales of Red Pills in the two Huaihai prefectures are about more than 5 million yuan. Red Pill smokers can be divided into three levels: A. Laborers, coolies, and beggars; B. Farmers and workers; C. Well-to-do young families. The size of their smoking amount increases or decreases depending on the amount of money earned each day. Therefore, the consumption of laborers, coolies, and beggars is relatively limited, unlike wealthy young people who can smoke as much as they want. At present, in the Huaihai area, farmers, workers, and laborers account for 70% of the Red Pill smokers, and well-to-do young sons account for 30%. The original price of each Red Pill can is about ten yuan, but vendors can sell it for more than twenty yuan after reselling. This refers to vendors. If they purchase raw materials and manufacture it themselves, the profits are even greater. Therefore, in the Huaihai area, unscrupulous merchants, wealthy gentry, and magnates who only seek profit consider this to be a shortcut to wealth and flock to it. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has silently observed the hidden evils and has strictly ordered the county magistrates of various counties in northern Jiangsu to strictly prohibit it together to show its determination.</p>
<h3>Changes in Court President and Prosecutor</h3>
<p>Xu Erxi, the chief prosecutor of the Zhenjiang District Court, has been transferred to the Wuhu County Court. His vacancy will be filled by Liu Xiaokang, who was appointed by the Ministry. Because Liu indicated that he would not take the position, the Ministry of Justice specially transferred Huang Yongzhong, the president of the court, to the position. The vacant position of president will be filled by Hu Yigu, a judge from the Shanghai Court. Mr. Hu is scheduled to come to Zhenjiang next Tuesday to take office. The handover of both the court and the prosecutor's office has been completed and they are waiting for the replacement.</p>
<h3>Joint Defense Meeting of Wuxi, Wujin, Chengjiang, and Changshu</h3>
<p>The joint defense area of ​​Wuxi, Wujin, Chengjiang, and Changshu held its twelfth joint defense meeting at the Wuxi County Government the other day. The attendees were Changshu County Magistrate Tan Yigui, Wujin County Magistrate Zhang Pengzhu, Jiangyin County Magistrate Ma Zhenbang, Wuxi County Magistrate Chen Chuande, Zhang Zhaonan of the Second Yong Police District, and representatives from the land and water public security police teams. The resolutions were as follows: 1. Public security bureaus and teams related to this joint defense area should implement the designated meeting points in accordance with the instructions of this office to the respective counties. 2. Any changes in the location and number of troops stationed in each county should be filled in and sent to this office for verification by this office. 3. The budget of this joint defense area will be passed according to the previous year's budget. 4. A continuation meeting will be held at the Wuxi County Government on the afternoon of the 17th.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault Case in the Twelfth District</h3>
<p>Zhou Jinxiang, a villager from the 343rd block of the twelfth district of the county, is already in his sixties. His son, Yunxiang, is a farmer. The family is well-off. Around midnight the other night, the whole family had already gone to bed when suddenly seven or eight bandits broke in through the back door. Three thieves were on guard outside, and the other five entered the house, all holding pistols and flashlights. They forbade anyone from making a sound and searched all the rooms at will. Jinxiang and his daughter-in-law, Zou, were beaten for refusing to reveal the location of their hidden silver. Before leaving, they kidnapped the owner's thirteen-year-old grandson, Arong. Yesterday, the owner submitted a list of losses to the 11th Sub-bureau of the township's Public Security Bureau, which was forwarded to the county government, requesting the arrest of the stolen goods and the rescue of the hostage.</p>

<h3>Fake Gold Bracelet Discovered and Escorted to the County</h3>
<p>One afternoon, Yu Huang, a training officer from the 3rd Regiment of the Provincial Security Office stationed in the town, went to Nantong on official business and passed through Jiangyin. Lacking travel expenses, he exchanged a gold bracelet for 40.5 yuan at Bao Cheng Silver Shop on East Street. He then went to the West Bus Station. Later, the shop clerk discovered that it was made of copper and immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which arrested Yu Huang. At the same time, Tian Bao Hua Silver Shop in North Gate also received a fake bracelet. After discovering it, they pursued it and brought it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Yu claimed that the two gold bracelets were purchased from someone this spring with two pawn tickets, which he redeemed in Nantong last month, and that he did not know they were fake. He was escorted to the county for handling on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Meeting to Review Local Deficits</h3>
<p>The county party department convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies at 2:00 PM on the 1st to review the local financial deficits of the Property Management Office over the years. It was found that the Property Management Office had a listed total deficit of more than 221,400 yuan. After offsetting the 150,000 yuan collected from the 5-cent per mu land tax (excluding education fees), there was still a deficit of more than 71,400 yuan. It is now proposed to include all the outstanding old debts from the 17th and 18th years and the winter grain and reed tax from the 19th and 20th years delivered by the Property Management Office, totaling more than 125,200 yuan, for a total amount of more than 275,200 yuan. Then, according to the precedents of previous years, the actual collection is discounted, so the total amount is 220,000 yuan, which can barely be met. It was decided to submit it to the general meeting for approval and then check the listed arrears. It seems that a comprehensive plan should be made to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent items. It is proposed that the principle of repaying the loans as soon as possible with short-term loans should be adopted. It was decided to suggest that the general meeting adopt it.</p>

<h3>Robberies Occur Repeatedly in the 14th District</h3>
<p>The Shen family in Shenjiatang, Beixiang, an old town in the 14th district of Wuyi, recently took two wives, which attracted the attention of bandits. One night, more than a dozen armed bandits went to their house to rob them. All three rooms in Shen's daughter-in-law's room were searched, and the losses were very heavy. Also, Wu Linhai's house in Xiaocun, Lushuxiang, in the same district, was robbed at about 1:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd. The nearby residents are all panicked because of the rampant bandits.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<h3>Two Hostages Escape from Masih Bridge</h3>
<p>Two months ago, the Dong Shengbao Dong Tongsheng family in Masih Bridge, the fifth district of this county, was suddenly robbed by bandits, and Dong's son Qiyuan and Dong Jielu were taken away. Their whereabouts are still unknown. It is now reported that the bandits are hiding in Haimen, north of the Yangtze River. The police team intercepted the two hostages. After questioning, they learned that they were from Changshu County. The county government sent a letter to the county government in this county to inform the family of the hostages. The county government here has notified the family, Dong Tongsheng, to go to Haimen with the investigators of the Public Security Bureau, Qi Yunsheng, to file a complaint.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver Strike Unresolved</h3>
<p>There are about 400 rickshaws in this county, and there are also more than 300 privately owned chartered rickshaws. With the decline of commerce, the business of rickshaw drivers has also been greatly affected. They sit on the streets all day, struggling to make a living. However, the rent cannot be missed for even one day. Because of these circumstances, a general strike was unanimously launched starting on the afternoon of the 1st of this month. Except for privately owned chartered rickshaws, rickshaws are nowhere to be seen on the streets. It is reported that their purpose is to request the capitalists to reduce the rent (the rent is 780 cash per day, and now they plan to reduce it to 2 jiao). However, since the Rickshaw Drivers' Union was dissolved this spring, there is no group gathering. The capitalists have no way to contact and resolve the issue for a while. They are currently looking for rickshaw bosses to discuss solutions.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Contracting the Slaughter Tax Resolved</h3>
<p>The principal and supplementary slaughter taxes of this county have always been contracted by Feng Kaisheng for collection.

<h3>The City Government Protests to France and Japan Over the Arrest of Kim Young Duk</h3>
<p>Demanding Legal Protection for Chinese Residents Living in Concessions</p>
<p>Kim Recounted Being Brutally Tortured After Being Kidnapped to the Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>Petitioning the City Government to Request Negotiations with the Japanese Side</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate has Issued an Arrest Warrant, and the French Consulate is Considering It</p>
<p>The city government has protested to both the French and Japanese consulates yesterday afternoon because Japanese plainclothes police have entered the French Concession to arrest people more than once. Kim Young Duk also issued a statement about his arrest. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>City Government Protest</h3>
<p>The city government sent protest letters to both the French and Japanese consulates simultaneously at 3:00 PM yesterday. According to the city government's announcement, regarding the case of Japanese consulate plainclothes detectives arbitrarily arresting Kim Young Duk in the French Concession, the city government had already made verbal protests to the French Concession authorities and the Japanese consulate on the day of the incident. Yesterday (3rd), Mayor Wu also sent Secretary Geng Jiaqi to the French Consulate General to submit a written protest, stating that Kim Young Duk is a naturalized Chinese citizen. It is extremely shocking that the French authorities allowed Japanese plainclothes detectives to commit armed robbery and illegally arrest him. Your Excellency, the Consul General, has a responsibility to protect the residents of the concession. Therefore, the occurrence of this incident is deeply regrettable. It is hoped that Your Excellency, the Consul General, will pay close attention to this case so that Chinese citizens residing in the concession can live in peace and enjoy the protection of Chinese law.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that the city government also believes that the illegal arrest of Kim Young Duk, a naturalized Chinese citizen, by Japanese consulate plainclothes detectives is not only an insult to Kim Young Duk personally, but also shows disrespect to the Chinese government by failing to notify the Chinese government in advance. Therefore, the city government also protested to the Japanese consulate yesterday afternoon, demanding an apology from the Japanese consulate and compensation for the losses incurred, and ensuring that similar unfortunate incidents will not occur in the future.</p>
<h3>Director Zhang's Statement</h3>
<p>According to Zhang Tingrong, director of the City Government Intelligence Office, to a reporter from the Central News Agency, Kim Young Duk's petition for rescue was delivered to the city government the day before yesterday. Kim Young Duk is indeed a naturalized Chinese citizen. Although he has been released after negotiations with the French Consulate, there are a large number of Chinese people residing in the French Concession. The Concession authorities should protect the safety of Chinese people in accordance with Chinese law. Therefore, after Kim Young Duk's petition was delivered to the city government, the city government immediately decided to submit a written protest to the French Consulate to ensure that Chinese people residing in the French Concession can live in peace. However, the initiator of this case was the Japanese side. Therefore, in addition to submitting a written protest to the French side, the city government also submitted a written protest to the Japanese side. The protest letter will be released after it reaches the Japanese consulate.</p>
<h3>The Arrest</h3>
<p>After his release, Kim Young Duk originally planned to meet with reporters, but due to lack of time, he drafted a document himself to describe his arrest. He said that Huang Zhanying, who claimed to be from Guangdong, introduced a Guangdong revolutionary, Zhou, to his nephew, Kim Cheol, for an appointment at 8:00 PM on the 30th of last month. After Huang and Zhou arrived, they said that a Mr. Li was a friend, so they went out together. After waiting for more than 40 minutes, seven Japanese plainclothes police officers suddenly broke in and took him to a car, which drove to the Japanese consulate. He was taken into a small room, where two Japanese began interrogating him. There was another large room with a large number of armed police officers on guard. The key points of their interrogation focused on two items: 1. The secret addresses of Korean revolutionaries in Shanghai; 2. The accomplices in the bombing cases in Tokyo and Hongkou. He replied that he did not know about these. The Japanese police then subjected him to extreme torture, causing injuries to his head and hands. The interrogation lasted about four hours. The rest was waiting for negotiations. According to Guowen News Agency, Kim has taken his family away from Shanghai to avoid further problems.</p>
<h3>Petition to the City Government</h3>
<p>Tsai Xiaobai, Kim Young Duk's representative lawyer, submitted a petition to the city government yesterday, stating that the petitioner was entrusted by Kim Young Duk (i.e., Kim Cheol) and Kim Cheol on November 30 to handle negotiations with the French Consulate for his release. Kim Young Duk was also sent to the French Consulate by the Japanese Consulate at about 7:00 PM on the same day and released immediately, entirely due to the vigorous negotiations of Your Excellency's government. After Kim Young Duk was kidnapped to the Japanese Consulate by Japanese plainclothes soldiers, he was subjected to severe torture, and there were injuries to his face and limbs, and many bruises on his waist and back. He is currently residing in the hospital for treatment and will not be able to recover in the shortest possible time. After Kim Young Duk and Kim Cheol became naturalized Chinese citizens in October of the 18th year of the Republic of China, they held Nationality Certificate No. 67 issued by the alliance. The certificate was delivered by the petitioner to the French side for verification. Kim and others are indeed Chinese citizens. This time, the Japanese arbitrarily arrested Chinese citizens without reason and subjected them to torture, disregarding justice and inhumanity, which is deeply hateful. Afterwards, they released him after realizing that they were wrong. Their acknowledgment of illegality has been proven and there is no doubt about it. The matter concerns national rights and people's lives, and is of great importance. Therefore, it is requested that Your Excellency's government immediately lodge a serious protest with the Japanese consulate, demanding a formal written apology and ensuring that similar incidents will not occur in the future. As for the medical expenses for Kim Young Duk's injuries, it is stated that they are reserved. The 560 yuan in banknotes, a gold watch, a fountain pen, a wool coat, and a seal that were searched and taken away by the Japanese detectives should be negotiated for their return so that they can be claimed. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai City Government.</p>
<h3>Kim Cheol's Resume</h3>
<p>Kim Cheol, courtesy name Young Duk, is 42 years old and has been engaged in revolutionary work for 19 years. He is from Hampyeong, Jeollanam-do, Korea. At the age of 22, he graduated from Dongdae Law College. Indignant at Japan's annexation of Korea, he engaged in the restoration movement. At the age of 23, he left Korea and came to Shanghai to engage in educating Korean children with Korean patriots at sea. After the end of the European War in 1918, he organized the New Korean Youth Party in Shanghai on November 26 of the same year to restore the motherland. Kim served as the party's finance committee chairman. In the same year, he and Dr. Kim Kyu-sik were sent to study in Paris. He secretly returned to Korea and made an agreement with Son Byeong-hee, the leader of Cheondoism, for independence and issued a declaration of independence. Unfortunately, it was unsuccessful. He returned to Shanghai in February 1919, joined comrades, and organized a provisional government. Kim served as the finance committee chairman. The following year, he was transferred to the position of Minister of Transportation. The provisional government was reformed, and he served as Minister of Justice, Minister of Military Affairs, Minister of Finance, and other positions. Three years ago, he formed the Korean Independence Party and served as the director of the party's finance department. He is selfless and righteous, has nationalistic ideas, and is respected by Koreans. However, he has no children and adopted his nephew Kim Cheol as his heir. On October 5th, 28th year of the Republic of China, he became a citizen of the Republic of China and holds Naturalization Certificate No. 67 issued by the Ministry of Interior. Since then, Kim has not participated in Korean revolutionary work for three to five years.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Strictly Pursues</h3>
<p>Dalu News reported that the police department of the Japanese Consulate General has filled out two arrest warrants yesterday and sent them to French Consul General Meyrier, requesting the arrest of Kim Cheol and his nephew Kim Cheol. However, it is not yet known what crimes the Japanese side is accusing them of. It is expected that it must be related to political activities. The French Consulate General received the Japanese arrest warrant yesterday afternoon and is still considering it and has not ordered the police to arrest the two.</p>
<h3>Police File Suit</h3>
<p>The French police have requested the Japanese Consular Court to punish Ainou, Yamazaki, and five other Japanese who fled in a car after arbitrarily arresting Kim on Wednesday. The reply from the Japanese court is currently pending. It is heard that the French police intend to charge the seven with armed kidnapping.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Cables Various Circles in Shanghai Again</h3>
<p>Swearing to Fight to the End as Long as One Breath Remains. Ma is Currently Traveling Indirectly to Zha to Negotiate Everything. General Ma Zhanshan cabled Mr. Zhu Qinglan yesterday, asking him to forward it to various circles in Shanghai, including the statement that he would swear to encourage his troops and fight to the end as long as one breath remained. The cable went as follows: (Omitted above) I previously received and stored the consolation funds from Shanghai, and I also received a cable from President Zhang ordering a quick remittance. They have been remitted one after another. The first batch consisted of six payments totaling 21,893 yuan and some cents. The second batch consisted of one payment totaling 70,000 yuan, which was donated by compatriots in Batavia and received by Shi, Mu, Wang, Du, and other gentlemen. In addition to filling out the receipts and mailing them to the bank and cabling the compatriots and Shi et al. to express my gratitude, I know that you are concerned, so I am cabling you to inform you. As long as I, Zhanshan, have one breath left, I swear to encourage my troops and fight to the end so as not to fail the enthusiasm of my colleagues and compatriots at home and abroad who have helped me. I am currently traveling indirectly to Zha to negotiate everything with Han Zhang and Xiang Ge. I will continue to report on how things will proceed in the future. Ma Zhanshan kowtows.</p>
<h3>A Small Disturbance on Nanjing Road Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Youth Party Held a Commemoration, and Several People Were Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than a dozen people who looked like students, businessmen, and workers held a demonstration at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road. First, two youths who had been ambushing in advance set off firecrackers at the traffic lights at the intersection. Suddenly, the sound of firecrackers was loud, and colorful slogans and leaflets fell one after another. Passers-by gathered, and the crowd shouted slogans, interrupting traffic for a while. People discussed and argued frequently. After about 15 minutes of disturbance, the Western police sent a car to disperse them, and it was reported that several suspects were arrested. Order was quickly restored. Afterwards, a letter was sent to various newspapers, stating that the National Socialist Chinese Youth Party held its 9th anniversary commemoration and advocated war against Japan.</p>
<h3>Li Jingzong Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Aboard Successfully Tested Aircraft</h3>
<p>Talks on Successful Test Flight of Northwest Route</p>
<p>Decision to Officially Launch on the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>The Riri News Agency reports that Mr. Li Jingzong, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Transportation, returned to Beijing from Ping yesterday afternoon (the 3rd) at 2:30 PM, arriving in Shanghai aboard a test flight aircraft. A reporter from the Riri News Agency paid a special visit to Mr. Li at his private residence yesterday. According to the conversation, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua, recognizing that the northwest is a remote border region adjacent to untrustworthy neighbors, and that its abundant resources are easily coveted, believes that if development is not urgently planned, it will be insufficient to secure the frontier and benefit the border regions. Development, however, requires transportation, so he considers the northwest section of the Eurasian postal transport air route to be necessary to expedite. Furthermore, in view of the postal blockade of the Northeast, Chinese and foreign individuals sending mail to Europe, in order to save time, often fail to appreciate the government's plight, and instead deliver to illegal organizations established by certain parties, hoping to transfer through Siberia to Europe, which results in the outflow of authority. Therefore, expediting the northwest air route to promote the completion of the Eurasian postal transport air route is considered particularly important. However, since the reorganization of the Eurasian Aviation Corporation in June of this year, it has not only repeatedly failed to test the planned routes, but has also almost halted the established routes. Zhu believes that this phenomenon is related to the lack of specialized knowledge, experience, and the ability to manage foreigners on the part of the company's responsible personnel. Therefore, in addition to summoning Mr. Schmidt, the director of the flight crew, to the ministry on the day he took office to personally instruct him, he also appointed himself, as the party who negotiated the Sino-German joint venture Eurasian Aviation Postal Transport contract and the first successful test flight in the northwest, and who is familiar with the Eurasian Aviation Corporation and the northwest situation, to supervise Schmidt and complete the northwest section test flight work by the end of November, in order to prepare for the official launch at the Third Plenary Session. The test flight aircraft arrived in Suzhou on November 18, Hami on the 20th, Dihua on the 21st, Tacheng on the Sino-Russian border on the 25th, flew back to Suzhou on the 29th, Xi'an on the 1st of this month, and Nanjing on the 2nd. Because Zhu had already come to Shanghai on official business on the night of the 1st, he (Li) specially led Schmidt and the aircraft that successfully tested the northwest route to Shanghai today (i.e., yesterday) to report in person and discuss all the preparatory procedures for the official launch on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Li Fusun Talks About Observations from Travel in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Patriotic, Cooperation from All Sectors Is Necessary. Mr. Li Fusun recently gave a speech at the local association on his observations from traveling in Southeast Asia, which is recorded as follows: This trip to Southeast Asia was to send my daughter to Europe to study, and to take the opportunity to inspect the local situation. Furthermore, as I handled the national salvation donations from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, I also needed to report to the people there. After arriving in Singapore, I immediately went to Penang, stayed for four days, and was welcomed by the local meeting. I thanked them on behalf of the Shanghai victims. The patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese is admirable. Although the economic situation has been poor in recent years, it has not diminished their courage to save the country, even among the workers. Those who have become wealthy in Singapore through business often consider Penang as a place to reside for a long time. Their excellent residences all belong to Chinese people. The arrangements in front of the doors are all in the old Chinese style. I often see large lanterns hanging with the name of a certain surname, like the residences of retired officials in the Qing Dynasty. The overseas Chinese there once asked me to whom the national salvation donations should be remitted for proper handling. I replied immediately that it would be most appropriate to remit them to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao for collection and distribution. More than a dozen workers from the labor community there entrusted me with funds to bring back to the motherland and deliver to the receiving agency for relief purposes. Furthermore, the Perak Chamber of Commerce sent representatives to entrust me with tens of thousands of taels of silver for collection and transfer. The overseas Chinese are very concerned about foreign humiliation, and their newspaper propaganda spares no effort. Among the overseas Chinese there, the Hokkien people are the most numerous, followed by the Cantonese. I then went to Singapore, stayed for eight days, and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and various directors held banquets to welcome me separately. Because I had previously handled the donation of funds, I could not bring the report because it was not yet printed, so I only showed them photos of the Memorial Village and told them about the distribution and usage, which was very satisfying. However, the British Malayan Peninsula (i.e., Singapore, Penang, etc.) has a Chinese Affairs Department, which specializes in Chinese affairs. They are very careful about the nature of Chinese donations. The photos provided further proof and strengthened their trust in the donation for refugee relief. I spoke and met with the Director of Chinese Affairs. The next day, I visited him and explained the donation situation in detail. In Southeast Asia, the industries are tin mining and rubber. Now the price of rubber has fallen. It used to be worth one dollar and eighty-one cents per pound, but now it has fallen to six or seven cents per pound. Workers' lives are becoming increasingly difficult, earning only one or two cents per day, and many rubber plantation owners have gone bankrupt. The number of unemployed workers is increasing. Last year, the local government repatriated about 200,000 unemployed overseas Chinese to their homeland. When sending them back, they provided clothing, food, travel expenses, and a small amount of living expenses. Now they have restricted Chinese immigration. The local government strictly prohibits foreigners from engaging in political activities, saying it easily disrupts commerce. As for the crackdown on Chinese workers, it is actually due to economic decline. The rubber plantations are desolate, and the number of those being sold and mortgaged is unknown. They are now trying to find ways to change the planting to jackfruit and rice. Mr. Chen Jiageng runs a rubber factory, originally to raise funds for Xiamen University, so that Fujian education can be on par with Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, he is generally respected as a great figure. Mr. Chen is very enthusiastic about using domestic goods and still maintains a worker's attitude. He also described in detail to me that domestic cloth is either not strong enough or the width is narrower, and should be improved. Since the Ottawa Conference, Britain has emphasized protection policies in trade with its territories. The sales of British Southeast Asian products are expected to improve. Overseas Chinese find life easier in the tropics. If the market turns around, their lives can be improved. In the past, overseas Chinese education was not very developed, so the organization was not very sound. Now it has improved slightly. It is reported that in the past, overseas Chinese remitted about 30 million yuan back to China, which is deeply related to the national economy. Therefore, we must cooperate with overseas Chinese to revive the entire national economy. The method of cooperation is to use surplus funds to support overseas Chinese businesses, so that they can be maintained to await a turnaround, and to find ways to promote products, such as rubber and rubber products. As for banking, the banks established by overseas Chinese there are already sufficient to meet the needs, and domestic banks do not need to set up branches there to avoid unnecessary competition. It is estimated that after the September 18th Incident, a total of 2 million yuan was remitted back for donations. If it were during a prosperous market, it would have been 6 to 7 million yuan. Overseas Chinese can be divided into three types: (1) Those who went from China are the most enthusiastic about patriotism; (2) Those who grew up abroad and have returned to China also have enthusiasm; (3) Those who were born locally and have never returned to China inevitably have a weaker attachment to national affairs, which is not surprising. Therefore, the first type of overseas Chinese bears the heaviest burden. Those who wish to return to China to do business, I advise them to continue developing locally, as the Chinese there really account for the greatest effort. The British are very grateful for the Chinese's business efforts. In the past, when it was prosperous, the Singapore municipal government had abundant income, often exceeding the budget. To this day, the municipal treasury still has ample funds, and 80% of the income comes from overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have such great achievements and a deeply rooted foundation, and are so deeply concerned about the motherland. We must not discriminate against them. Please, Chairman Shi, use the power of newspapers to encourage all sectors to cooperate with overseas Chinese.</p>

Next, Supervisor Xue Dubi spoke, saying, in brief, "The loyalty and bravery of the Liaojihei Rehe Volunteer Army in resisting Japan, under the great hardship of hunger, cold, and lack of ammunition, and their bloody battle against Japanese imperialism, cannot but inspire all citizens. They should be given full support in terms of strength. Our association is able to disregard difficulties and take on this mission. I hope that you will have a spirit of perseverance, hardship, and excellence, and work hard. If the Volunteer Army does not stop fighting and the lost territory of the Northeast is not recovered, the support work in the rear cannot be terminated. Furthermore, we must avoid the common malpractices of general organizations and do real work to save the country. Especially regarding the receipt and expenditure of donations, it must be made public everywhere, so that the people of the whole country can understand and trust us, so that the soldiers at the front who are truly resisting Japan can receive assistance from the people." Wang Hanliang, Tan Yigong, Xiao Sizhi, and others then gave speeches in succession. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.</p>

<p>Telegraphic Request to Send Troops: The Northeast Volunteer Army Medical Team sent a telegram: "To all compatriots, all newspapers, and all groups in the country: Imperialist Japan, wielding its violence, tramples on our national soil, invades our sovereignty, has already occupied the Northeast and destroyed Shanghai. The people of the whole country are heartbroken. Fortunately, the 19th Route Army fought in Jiangnan, and the Volunteer Army shed blood in the Northeast, giving the violent Japanese a major blow. However, Imperialist Japan, because it has failed to achieve its goals of aggression, its military policy remains unchanged, and it still reveals its hideous face, thinking of annexing our country in one fell swoop. The recent situation in the League of Nations, deciding to submit the Lytton Report for discussion by the General Assembly, no matter how it is used, will not benefit our country in any way. The national situation is like this, and the diplomatic situation is also like this. Survival is imminent. The plan to save the country lies in the people of the country. We hope that the people of the whole country will unite and arm themselves, prepare with the greatest determination, and work hard to support the effort with real strength. It should be known that the Volunteer Army is fighting bloody battles in the freezing cold of the snowy fields. We should give them spiritual support and material assistance, for if the Volunteer Army survives, the country survives; if the Volunteer Army perishes, the country perishes. For the sake of protecting our national soil, for the sake of our nation and survival, we still hope that the government will quickly mobilize large armies from within the borders to cross the border and kill the bandits, and the people will maintain the integrity of our territory and the unity of our sovereignty. We must adhere to this position and strive to fight. Do not have the idea of asking for help from others. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate."</p>

<h3>Negotiations on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Four Warehouses Case to Begin</h3>

<h3>Yesterday's Aviation Mass Solicitation Was a Great Success</h3>
<p>A Total of 254 Scout Troops, 1,270 People, Participated</p>
<p>Students from Various Schools Enthusiastically Requested to Participate in National Salvation Work Temporarily</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day of the city's Boy Scouts' general mobilization for aviation mass solicitation. A total of 254 troops of boys and girls participated, with five people in each troop, totaling 1,270 people. They started working from the Bund at 9:00 AM. All businesses expressed deep sympathy for the construction of aviation and the consolidation of national defense, and voluntarily joined the Chinese Aviation Construction Association as members. It rained lightly in the afternoon, but the morale of the Scouts was very good, and the discipline was orderly. The police in the concession did their best to protect them, which was quite commendable. The general office was located at the Boy Scout headquarters of the Moor Hall on Sanma Road. Yin Zhiling, Xu Tongye, Zhang Fan, and others dispatched by the Aviation Construction Association, together with Wang Gang, Leng Yunqiao, Jin Bingquan, and more than 30 others from the City Boy Scouts, were stationed at the headquarters, working day and night, and providing care along the way. A traffic team was organized to take charge. The printed materials distributed yesterday included the Aviation Special Issue (City Boy Scout General Mobilization Solicitation Issue), a general overview of the Aviation Construction Association, and a volunteer registration form, totaling five types, each printed in 10,000 copies, which were still not enough to meet the demand. In addition, dozens of schools, such as Zhengyi Middle School, voluntarily joined the work temporarily, led by teachers to the meeting, requesting the distribution of territory. The association said that this solicitation was designated to be carried out by the Boy Scouts and that another date would be set in the future specifically for students from various schools to participate. The requesting students left obediently, which shows that the national salvation movement has penetrated people's hearts. All Chinese people should take responsibility, and young students, as the masters of China, cannot abandon their duties. Some troops of Boy Scouts, because the assigned territory was too short, had already walked through it in a short time and requested additional routes, showing their enthusiasm for aviation. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, the troops successively arrived at the meeting to report on the progress of their work. The results were excellent. The statistics of solicitations for each troop have not yet been compiled and will be disclosed later. It is also heard that the association received letters yesterday from student groups in other cities, such as Nanjing and Hangzhou, responding to the actions of the Shanghai City Boy Scouts, and each held similar events locally, so that the public could understand the true meaning of national salvation.</p>

<h3>Entertainment Gala for the Relief of Northeast Refugees</h3>
<p>Boy Scouts Set Off in the Rain, Elementary School Students Enthusiastically Purchase Tickets, and the Junior Academy of Painting Begins to Create Picture Books. The Shanghai Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Lawyers Association, the Accountants Association, and other four organizations are sponsoring a large entertainment gala for the relief of Northeast refugees. Since the Free Boy Scouts began setting off to sell tickets, the results have been quite good. People from all walks of life are also very enthusiastic about purchasing tickets, especially elementary school students. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Boy Scouts Set Off in the Rain: The entertainment tickets are being distributed and sold by Boy Scouts from the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, the Postal Workers Union, the Shanghai-Ningbo Steamship Cabin Staff Union, and the four silk reeling industry unions. The results have been excellent, exceeding the allotted number. Although it was drizzling yesterday, the Boy Scouts were still in high spirits, selling door-to-door to stores and households in the Nanshi French Concession and various districts. In the evening, they also went to major hotels, restaurants, and brothels to solicit donations, and at the same time made national salvation propaganda. Those who heard were moved until they returned to the association at 11:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's News on Relief for Northeast China Refugees</h3>

The results have been remarkably impressive. The following industry associations are currently also in the process of doing so. A summary is provided below.</p>

<h3>Record of Inspection of Completed Dike Construction by the National Government Flood Relief Committee (6)</h3>
<p>Inspection of the Third District: The Jiangxin steamer set sail at half past twelve. At 4 PM, it arrived at Majiawo and began the inspection of the Third District's engineering. The entire length of the Third District's dike is approximately 281.4 kilometers, with a total of 2,843,292 cubic meters of earthwork completed. The cost was 123,005.59 silver dollars, and the number of disaster relief workers reached 40,125. The area is on the south bank of the Yangtze River, from Fangjia Zhou in Qiupu County to Datong Town, and on the north bank from Zhou Tou Town in Susong County to Liubai Zhang. The Guangji Embankment project is the largest, starting from Zongyang Town, passing through Majiawo and other places, reaching Anqing, with a length of 90 kilometers and a dike width of 8 meters. It provides protection for tens of thousands of mu of farmland within the dike.</p>
<p>Bank Erosion: After arriving at Majiawo, a small boat was hired to reach the north bank to inspect the Guangji Embankment. While in the boat, it was observed that the erosion of mud and sand on the north bank was very rapid, and a gap appeared in an instant. After landing and walking for about a li (half a kilometer), the new dike was reached. The whole way was covered in extremely thick river sand. Walking was like walking on the sand dunes north of the river; the ground sank by an inch with each step, and dust and sand covered the face. The old dike along the river had completely collapsed, and the new dike was also mostly constructed of sand, so it had already subsided by an inch. Although the dike surface was more than twice as wide as usual, due to the easily eroded nature of the sand, it was feared that it would not last long. According to Mr. Xi Dejiong, it was not easy to find a large amount of clay in this area. Although there were light railways and small freight cars, there was still no solution, so it was necessary to mix in sand. The sides of the current dike were made of pure clay, so that it would not be too easily destroyed. The erosion of sand on the riverbank has a huge impact on the dike construction. If no measures are taken to build a drop structure to reduce the force of the water flow, the erosion will continue day and night. After a year, the land along the river will be submerged, not to mention the new dike. This is something that should be given special attention by the government.</p>
<p>Inspection Team of Bandit Areas: Regarding the event where Generalissimo Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission will host the inspection team of bandit areas in four provinces, Xu Shiying, Li Zujun, Wen Lanting, and others, after detailed consultation today, decided to add the entire inspection team. In the afternoon, they telegraphed Chiang, reporting the progress of the organization and hoping that he would send personnel to host them. It was named the Inspection Team for the Temporary Relief and Rehabilitation Association of Bandit Areas in the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Provinces, led by Xu Shiying. The telegram briefly stated: During this Flood Relief Committee inspection of dike construction, bandits disappeared along the way and residents lived in peace. This shows your great success in suppressing bandits. The representatives are deeply grateful. It is now resolved that the entire group will join the inspection team. Starting today, they will take advantage of the dike construction inspection to also inspect the bandit areas and visit residents suffering from banditry. Upon arrival in Wuhan, they will visit Your Excellency immediately. We respectfully report. Also, after arriving in Anqing, a telegram was sent to Shanghai to report the progress of the organization. (Qian Hua, from Anqing, evening of the 30th).</p>
<p>The inspection team sent a telegram from Jiujiang to Song Dai, the President of the Executive Yuan: To His Excellency Song Dai, President of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, we are grateful for the guidance and hospitality we received in Nanjing. After leaving Nanjing, we continued to inspect the dikes on both sides of the Yangtze River. The local areas are intact, the engineering is solid, and the autumn harvest is bountiful. The masses rejoice and express their gratitude for your virtues, which are boundless. We admire your leadership and successful completion of this great project. We have now left Xunyang and are heading west to continue the inspection. We know of your concern and respectfully report. All members of the Dike Inspection Team, bowing.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying and Others Telegraph to Report on Inspection Itinerary</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Relief and Rehabilitation Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, located at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road in Shanghai, received a telegram from the inspection delegation led by Xu Jingren from Hankou.

<h3>The Yibin Steamer Catches Fire on the Upper Yangtze</h3>
<p>Many Crew Members Injured and Killed; Passengers Fortunately Unharmed. The "Yimao" steamer, belonging to the American-owned Jiejang Company, was en route from Chongqing, Sichuan, back to Shanghai. On the first of this month, while the ship was 35 miles downstream from Yichang, bandits were discovered on the shore. Foreign ships on the upper Yangtze usually have sailors on board for protection, and the ship was equipped with a machine gun in case of emergency. At the time, the bandits first fired shots at the "Yibin," intending to attack. The sailors on board returned fire. Unexpectedly, the bandits switched to using earthen cannons to bombard the ship. The ship was hit by a projectile, and the cannon fire ignited cargo, causing a sudden and fierce fire. The captain ordered the crew and sailors to fight the fire with all their might. Meanwhile, a fast boat was sent to Hankou to avoid the bandit area. It is reported that four or five lower-ranking crew members were injured or suffocated to death while fighting the fire. The ship arrived in Hankou on the 2nd, and the fire had been extinguished. After the Shanghai company learned of this news, they telegraphed Hankou to inquire about the truth of the matter. They also ordered the ship to unload its cargo in Hankou and return to Shanghai for repairs as soon as possible. Fortunately, none of the passengers were injured.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Request to Strictly Suppress Maritime Bandits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces yesterday. On the 2nd of this month, the Shanghai Kerosene Industry Association, a member of the Chamber, sent a letter stating: "Our member, the Guanghua Kerosene Company, informed us that the oil they transport by sailboat to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces must pass through the Wusongkou (Wusong Port). They were robbed by bandits in the sea near Wusong on three occasions in November of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], and again in April of the 20th year [1931], resulting in a total loss of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Although rewards have been offered repeatedly and requests have been made to the naval and land military and police agencies of both provinces to conduct strict investigations and arrests, most of the bandits have not been apprehended, and very little of the stolen oil has been recovered, which has greatly affected business. Since June of this year, maritime bandits have become even more rampant. The oil our company shipped to Chuan Kou (Chuan Port) was robbed in its entirety in the sea near Nanhui, Chuansha, Bailonggang, Jinshan, and other places. This included 1,500 pairs of barrel oil (note: 'pair' means tin) on the Xin Yonghe ship on June 21, 2,000 pairs of canned oil on the Dan Shunli ship on September 28, and 1,900 pairs of canned oil on the An Shun ship on October 3. Although we have requested that the relevant military and police agencies dispatch teams for strict investigation and arrest, months have passed without any recovery of the stolen goods. Such robberies are frequent, and arrests are neglected, causing commercial transport to lose its security. We are unable to even imagine what will happen to the future of our businesses. Therefore, we are requesting that you forward this matter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which will then present it to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, ordering the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to direct the naval and land military and police along the coast to jointly conduct strict investigations and arrests, bring the perpetrators to justice, and recover the stolen goods to provide relief to transporters and alleviate merchant hardship." Based on this, maritime banditry is rampant today. If we do not strengthen suppression efforts, the future of commercial transport will be worrisome. Therefore, we have sent a letter to your association requesting that you urgently forward it to the National Government's Executive Yuan, ordering the coastal authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to conduct strict investigations and arrests jointly, and also issue an order to the Navy Department to direct nearby warships to increase patrols to capture the stolen goods and suppress banditry. This is the situation. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, winter, bowing.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce further states that maritime banditry has become increasingly rampant in recent years, which is an undeniable fact. There are many cases of goods being robbed during transport, reported by member associations to the relevant authorities, but few cases of arrests and recovery of stolen goods, or of severe punishments. The kerosene industry, which transports oil to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, has been robbed as many as seven or eight times in the past year or two, and has yet to have a case solved. The industry has suffered losses. The implications of this negligence are not small. If arrests continue to be neglected and not thoroughly pursued, carriers will hesitate, which will greatly affect commercial transport and local security. Therefore, we respectfully request that your esteemed court and government review this matter and order a strict search and arrest along the coast to bring the perpetrators to justice, eliminate banditry, and provide security for merchants and travelers.</p>
<h3>Hope for Resolution of the China Electric Company Labor Strike Dashed; Arbitration Requested Yesterday</h3>

There was still no result after the deadline. The Bureau of Social Affairs conducted an investigation with both parties yesterday and learned that the possibility of a resolution was dashed. Therefore, in accordance with Article 4 of the Labor Dispute Resolution Law, a formal document and the entire case file were submitted to the municipal government for arbitration. At the same time, the labor and management parties were separately instructed to be notified and await arbitration.</p>
<h3>Methods for Collecting Products for Commercial Inspection to Participate in the Chicago Exposition</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Industry's National Industrial Survey</h3>
<p>All of Jiangsu Province Completed</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, in order to promote the development of national industry, will conduct a nationwide general industrial survey, and has ordered the Bureau of International Trade to handle it. The director of the Bureau, He Bingxian, immediately proceeded with the survey, starting with Jiangsu province. It began on September 1st, and was divided into two major districts, Jiangnan (south of the river) and Jiangbei (north of the river). The survey of the 31 counties in the Jiangnan district was completed in October. The Jiangbei district had 30 counties, divided into four sub-districts. The first sub-district surveyor, Xiao Guochou, was responsible for counties such as Qidong, Nantong, Rugao, Dongtai, Taixing, and Taixian. The second sub-district surveyor, Zhao Jian, was responsible for counties such as Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Huai'an, Huaiyin, and Siyang. The third sub-district surveyor, Ma Jibo, was responsible for eight counties such as Fengxian, Peixian, Pixian, Suqian, and Tongshan. The fourth sub-district surveyor, Lu Guoxiang, was responsible for several counties such as Yancheng, Lianshui, Donghai, and Ganyu. The survey director was Hou Houpei. Personnel from all locations have returned to Shanghai one after another in recent days. The survey of all 61 counties in Jiangsu province has now been completed. It is currently being compiled urgently. The industrial section is about to be printed. It is estimated that the Chinese version can be published within the year. It is reported that the survey contains quite rich materials. The important forms that were pre-determined were generally complete in each county. The survey period was uniform, and all of them refer to the most recent situation within three months. When the survey personnel arrived, various county governments, bureaus, and public and private institutions were able to provide assistance. Therefore, with the exception of a few places, there were no great difficulties in the process. At a time when this kind of material is lacking, it will be able to provide important reference for all sectors in the future. Currently, about 20 people are involved in the compilation work. The name of the book will be "Chinese Industrial Records, Jiangsu Province". The sample will be printed soon, and the bureau will start taking pre-orders.</p>
<h3>The Prerequisite for Foreign Rice Taxation</h3>
<p>Domestic Rice Must First Circulate Freely.</p>
<p>The issue of taxing foreign rice has been much discussed, but no concrete measures have been heard of. A reporter from the National News Agency visited the responsible official of the National Tariff Commission to inquire about the latest situation. According to them, in October, the Ministry of Finance convened a National Food Conference in Nanjing, with participants from relevant ministries and commissions of the central government and representatives from six provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei. Key personnel also participated in the discussions. At the conference, a proposal was drafted for a foreign rice import tax rate. The government is currently giving the case careful consideration, regarding the issue of food as a matter of great importance. The interests of provinces with a surplus of rice are slightly different from those with a deficit. It is necessary to ensure that the rice from surplus provinces can be supplied continuously, so that provinces with deficits have no need to rely on foreign rice, and there is no fear of food difficulties. However, in order to enable provinces to use their surplus to make up for the deficit, it is first necessary to abolish the precedent of provinces prohibiting rice from leaving the province, and the rice tax donations of all provinces. In addition, issues such as inconvenient transportation and high freight rates must be improved. Only then can domestic rice circulate freely. At that time, taxing foreign rice would be beneficial and without harm.</p>
<h3>Meeting Records of the Fire Insurance Claims Association in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fire Insurance Claims Association in Disaster Areas held a plenary committee meeting at 7:00 PM last night at No. 1, 6th Avenue (Liu Malu).

<p>Ferry Sinks</p>
<h3>Over Ten People Fall into the Water</h3>
<p>Only Seven Rescued, Six or Seven Missing</p>
<p>Texaco Tugboat Caused the Accident</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a Texaco tugboat collided with a ferry in the Huangpu River, causing the drowning of many passengers. The results of the investigation are described below.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Collision: The No. 1 tugboat of the Texaco Oil Company departed from the Customs Wharf yesterday morning at 6:00 AM with passengers bound for the company's wharf at Gaoqiao Shabenz. At approximately 6:10 AM, while sailing in the Yangshupu River near River Buoy No. 17, it encountered the Xin Yunfei tugboat coming from Pudong, which was towing a ferry headed for Puxi (west of the Huangpu River). At the time, the wind and waves were strong. The Xin Yunfei tugboat was traveling downstream, and the Texaco tugboat was sailing head-on. After the Xin Yunfei tugboat passed, the Texaco tugboat collided with the towed ferry. The ferry was breached and immediately began to sink.</p>
<p>Ferry Sinks: As the ferry was struck it went down in the water. All passengers on the ferry, traveling from Pudong to Shanghai, were workers. Over ten people were in the water as the ferry sunk. After this incident, the Texaco tugboat and the nearby Water Police Station rushed to rescue the victims. Various sampans also went to retrieve those who fell into the water.</p>
<p>Seven or Eight Rescued: The Water Police Station and the various sampans rescued the following men and women: Peng Guangui, 31 years old; Ding Guangyu, 44 years old; Shen Miaoling, Yu Zhaohou, 26 years old; Zhang Cashi, 25 years old, Zhou Changfu, 45 years old; and Zhang Zhushi, 49 years old, a total of seven people. As all of them sustained minor injuries, they were sent to Renji Hospital for bandaging and dressings, and then allowed to return home.</p>
<p>Many Drowned: According to the investigation, over ten passengers on the ferry towed by Xin Yunfei fell into the water. In addition to the seven rescued, six or seven were missing. The Water Police Station repeatedly tried to recover the bodies, but no bodies were found. Therefore, the exact number of dead could not be confirmed. After the accident, Xin Yunfei reported the incident to the Jianghai Customs River Authority, and the number of victims and missing persons is currently under detailed investigation. Negotiations are being prepared with the Texaco Company, as well as requesting compensation and condolences. The damaged ferry has sunk in the Huangpu River.</p>

<h3>One of the Assassination Case Perpetrators, a 19-Year-Old Cook</h3>
<p>Taken Back from the Municipal Public Security Bureau for Interrogation, Claiming He Was Falsely Accused of Being Denied a Loan</p>
<p>Xiao Liu, a native of Anhui, was shot and killed on the evening of July 22nd around 9 PM at the intersection of Yulin Road and Jixiang Lane while seeking relief from the heat. The Yulin Road police station, led by Chinese Detective Lu Gengsheng and Detective Xie Wanfang, successively arrested the perpetrators Sun Lianfu and Wang Zhongde, who was apprehended at the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The First Special District Court has heard and detained the suspects. The Shanghai Daily has previously covered these events. Another perpetrator, Housheng (also known as Han Sen or "Little Old Man"), was working as a cook at the security office located at No. 48 Fenglin Road in the Chinese district. The police station previously sent detectives to arrest the suspect, but were denied, claiming they needed to notify Mayor Wu and others. The police station received a phone call from the Municipal Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday, instructing them to take custody. The police chief ordered Detective Lu to rush to the bureau and bring back the suspect Han. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, recounted the previous events and stated that the defendant was identified by Sun Lianfu, who confessed that Wang Zhongde had provided them each with a handgun and 50 silver dollars to shoot and kill Xiao Liu. Presiding Judge Shen is hearing the case, and requested the court to question the suspect before rescheduling a joint interrogation. Han Sen, when questioned, testified that he was 19 years old, from Anhui, and acquainted with Sun Lianfu. He denied going with Sun Lianfu to kill Xiao Liu in Jixiang Lane. He claimed that Sun came to the security office afterwards to borrow ten silver dollars to flee, but was denied, causing resentment and leading to the false accusation. The police lawyer, Zhang, stated that the defendant had already confessed at the police station, and presented the confession for review. Judge Zhao Linyu ordered that the suspect be remanded in custody to be jointly interrogated with Sun Lianfu and the others.</p>
<h3>Changes to the Pig Tax Collection Method in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Lou Fumin Comes to Shanghai to Seek Support Without Success</p>
<p>Lou Fumin, a resettlement official from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance responsible for collecting pig taxes in Tongzhou, Rugao, Jingjiang, and Taixing, came to Shanghai from Nantong yesterday. This was due to the strong opposition from the local industry associations against illegal taxation. He aimed to explain the current collection situation to the fresh pig industry in Shanghai and seek their understanding, but without success. It is reported that Lou has also changed the collection method, from the original setup of checkpoints along the river to a unified collection. Regardless of size, each pig is valued at twenty yuan, and a tax of two jiao is levied at a rate of one-tenth of one percent. This is roughly similar to the previously proposed but unimplemented special business tax regulations. According to the special tax regulations for livestock, large pigs were valued at seventeen yuan and small pigs at five yuan, with a tax rate of two-tenths of one percent. Large pigs would be taxed at three jiao four fen, and small pigs at one jiao. Now, the valuation has been increased, and the rate has been reduced. The annual revenue is estimated to be one hundred thousand yuan, based on 500,000 pigs, with a total valuation of ten million yuan. Furthermore, Lou indicated that the collection rate could be reduced to eight-tenths of one percent. However, representatives from the fresh pig industries of Tongzhou, Rugao, Jingjiang, and Taixing convened a meeting yesterday to discuss and firmly oppose it.</p>
<h3>Donations from Three Provinces</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Fundraising Committee for Disaster Relief in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Provinces previously distributed donation registers to various organizations for fundraising. Yesterday, the following replies were received: ① Xiong Shi, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, replied, "We have received your letter and two donation registers. However, our province is as devastated as the three provinces, and the suffering of the people is unspeakable. We can only return the registers and cancel the account." ② Shi Ying, Mayor of Nanjing, replied, "We have received your letter and donation register. Previously, we received your telegram requesting donations and have already allocated 200 yuan. It is difficult to donate again." ③ The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission replied, "The Commission previously received a letter from the Nanjing Municipal Party Department requesting donations for disaster victims in the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei bandit areas. We have distributed it to the Commission's staff and affiliated agencies for fundraising. All donations have been submitted to the Municipal Party Department for forwarding. We are returning the donation register accordingly."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Asks for Cancellation of Anhui Province Rice Permit Tax</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting the abolition of the Anhui Province rice permit tax. The original text reads: "To the esteemed Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, on the 2nd of this month, according to a telegram from the Anhui Association in Beijing, on the 26th of this month, major domestic newspapers are competing to publish an article about the President of the National Food Regulation Association, Song Dai, sending a telegram to the Yuan, stating that all of you care about the people's food and protect their livelihoods, and people at home and abroad are ecstatic. People in Anhui are deeply impressed. Regulating the people's food is most important to circulation, and the key lies in exempting taxes. The telegram speaks in detail, and this association will not repeat it. This year, the rice-producing provinces have mostly had bumper harvests. Merchants are already burdened by the tightening of finance, and farmers are burdened by the harsh taxation of rice. Blocking the way out and stopping progress, rice prices are falling daily, and people are increasingly panicked. Even if we try to save it, I am afraid that it will be too late. However, the Anhui Provincial Government, under the pretext of restoring disguised likin, has set up a food export administration, levying six jiao per dan of food and three jiao per dan of miscellaneous grains, plus a 5% surcharge, armed extortion, tax networks densely distributed throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River, ignoring the clear order issued by the National Government on April 3, 1920, and violating Chairman Chiang's telegram of December 19, 1919. Moreover, it fundamentally contradicts the righteous propositions of the gentlemen and the Food Regulation Association. If we do not fight for justice, the future of the people's food and the rural economy are unimaginable. In addition to submitting a separate report from this association to Chairman Chiang of the Executive Yuan, we earnestly request a clear order to the Anhui Provincial Government to abolish it immediately in order to emphasize the public order. We also hope to be given strong support for the realization of beneficial regulation. How can the evil likin, which harms merchants and the people, be revived in today's Republic of China? There is no shortage of enlightened people in Zhongshan and Shanghai who dare to speak out for justice. The situation is urgent, please do not ignore it, etc.' The message arrived at the meeting. Upon investigation, rice is one of the hundreds of goods. Having a tax on exports is equivalent to a disguised likin. The collection of six jiao per dan, according to this year's rice price in Anhui Province, has almost reached 10%, which is unprecedented in the era of likin harming merchants. Although there are many bandits in Anhui, what about Jiangxi Province? Since Jiangxi Province had a bumper harvest this year, the income of the fields increased, and the rice inspection tax has been abolished. Therefore, Anhui Province should follow the same rules, eliminate abuses, and abolish political corruption. Otherwise, foreign rice will enter in endless quantities without taxes, while the province's agricultural products will have a surplus and cannot be sold, leading to the bankruptcy of the rural areas and plunging the people into desperation. The banditry is spreading, and we are thinking of cleaning it up. Why add fuel to the fire and prolong the chaos? We urgently telegraphed and request the esteemed Yuan and Ministry to investigate and order Anhui Province to immediately stop the rice permit tax for the sake of public convenience. Shanghai City Association bows respectfully."</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest Erupts Again at Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Telegraph Companies</h3>
<p>Workers Present Nine Demands, Management Expresses Firm Rejection</p>
<p>All delivery workers of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Telegraph Companies previously went on strike to demand a pay increase. Recently, they have made further requests to improve treatment. The union presented nine demands to the management, which were not accepted. Representatives were repeatedly dispatched for consultation, but without result. The workers' emotions are indignant, and labor unrest is brewing. Further requests will be made. The following records the details:</p>
<p>Nine Demands: Due to the difficulty of living, all workers recently held a general meeting and resolved to submit nine demands to the management to improve treatment: ① Increase the starting wage to 26 yuan. ② Immediately increase the wages of each person by 6 yuan. ③ In the future, workers will be promoted once a year, with a salary increase of 3 yuan each time, for a total of 16 levels, with the highest wage being 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Man and Woman Injured in Fire Escape, Carelessness on North Henan Road</h3>
<p>At approximately 3:50 AM yesterday, a fire broke out at Yichangyong Coal Shop, located at No. 412, North Henan Road, Haining Road, in the Public Concession. Smoke filled the air, and flames soared, eventually spreading to the neighboring Taicheng Rice Shop, Yongfeng Plywood Shop, Dingchang Gasoline Lamp Shop, Zhou Faxiang Copper and Tin Shop, and stopping at the Zhihua Factory. Because the factory building was a solid brick wall, it was not easy to catch fire. At the same time, firefighters had already begun to rescue, so it was preserved. Because it was late at night, residents were all sound asleep. Suddenly hearing the fire alarm, they were anxious to escape. A man and a woman were injured after jumping from the building and were taken to the hospital for treatment by ambulance. The fire was extinguished around 5:00 AM. It is estimated that four houses were burned down.</p>
<p>Four yuan. ④ At the end of each year, workers will be given an annual bonus, the method of which should follow the postal regulations. ⑤ When a worker resigns, whether dismissed by the company or retiring voluntarily, they will be given a severance payment equal to the number of years of service (for example, those who have served for 10 years will be given 10 months' salary as severance pay, and so on). ⑥ Working hours should be set at 8 hours. ⑦ Sundays and other days when the customs is closed and on duty should be calculated at double wages. ⑧ The company will subsidize workers' rent, 5 yuan per person per month. ⑨ The company will subsidize the workers' club expenses by 40 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Letter to the Company: The Three District Telecommunications Delivery Workers' Union, based on the demands of its members, immediately sent a letter to the authorities of the three companies, requesting acceptance. The original letter reads: "To the esteemed managers, the workers have been serving your company for many years, and have always been sincere and loyal, working hard, and daring not to slack off. I believe this is already well understood by your general manager. Now, due to the rising cost of living, the prices of all goods have increased. Taking the tram as an example, the starting fare used to be only 3 copper coins, but now it has increased to 7 coins, more than double the previous amount. The prices of other food, clothing, housing, and daily necessities have all increased several times. Therefore, employees of agencies such as the post office, customs, and railways have already increased wages and housing allowances to adapt to the needs of life. According to a survey, the lowest salary rate for workers in the above-mentioned agencies is more than 30 yuan, and the housing allowance is not included. The starting salary for workers was previously only 18 yuan. Although the general manager recently considered the workers' difficult living conditions and increased wages by 2 yuan, the maximum amount is only about 30 yuan. In these times of expensive goods, this small amount is far from meeting the needs of life. Not only is it impossible to support a family, but even personal needs are not enough. After repeated consideration, we have no choice but to submit nine requests. We hope that the general manager will accept and implement them. After careful consideration, the workers believe that these requests are extremely reasonable and do not go beyond what is reasonable and do not affect the company's economy. In the future, workers will have no worries about their lives, and they can work with peace of mind and strive for the development of the business, in order to achieve the goal of labor and capital coexisting and prospering. This is not only the honor of the workers but also the benefit of the company's future. We ask for your understanding and acceptance and look forward to a reply. We sincerely address the managers of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Telegraph Companies. The company did not give a definite reply after receiving the workers' request. The union sent Zhao Yanling and others as representatives to contact the general manager, Peng Sheng, but were also firmly rejected. Therefore, the emotions of all the workers are bitter, and further requests will be made today."</p>

<h3>Lawsuit for Separation of Concubine</h3>
<p>The Concubine Also Wants to Separate, Only Asking for the Return of 2,000 Yuan of Private Savings</p>
<p>Wei Zhichang, a native of Shaoxing, 34 years old, owns Xie Feng Silk Shop at No. 2, Zhufu Lane, Shilu, British Concession, selling various domestically produced silk fabrics from Dexing, Shengdan, Shengya, and other three silk weaving factories. The business is very good, and he has accumulated a considerable fortune. He married Chen, also from the same town, and has a son and a daughter. The son, Baojin, is 18 years old this year, and the daughter, Cuijuan, is 14 years old. They live at No. 27, Hengqing Lane, French Concession. In 1928, Wei worked as an accountant at Dexingchang Silk Factory in Zhangjiabang, and had a relationship with Zhu Suzhen (27 years old this year), a silk weaving woman in the factory. Soon after, he took Zhu as a concubine. In December of that year, he rented a house at No. 54, Weicheng Lane, Xiejiao, and lived together. They have now moved to No. 17, Xujiahui Road. They had a daughter, who soon died. Recently, Wei fell in love with someone else and suddenly developed a liking for the new and a dislike for the old. He accused Zhu of being addicted to gambling and unbearable to live with. He hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District, requesting mediation to persuade them to separate from the relationship of husband and concubine. The petition stated that the petitioner met the opposing party in 1928 at</p>
<p>Yihongyuan Brothel in Yaoer Alley: Her name was Xiaosuqin. The fifth old man pitied her suffering in the fire pit and paid to redeem her from the register. However, she was untamed and addicted to gambling. She secretly pawned and squandered all the petitioner's property. When the petitioner was away from home, the opposing party, fearing discovery, threw herself into the river in an attempt to commit suicide. She was arrested and detained in the old patrol room. Later, a friend named Zhu redeemed her, and her father also came to plead and wrote a letter of repentance, stating that if she gambled again and did not repent, she would unconditionally terminate the relationship. However, it was not long before she relapsed.</p>
<p>Too Ashamed to Face People: She voluntarily requested her husband to terminate the relationship in accordance with the agreement. Recently, she regretted the agreement and often came to make trouble and deliberately extort money, which was unbearable. Therefore, the petitioner requested the court to approve and order the termination of the relationship of husband and concubine. The court accepted the case and, at 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Li Shouyi opened the Civil Court No. 3 for mediation. The petitioner, Wei Zhichang, was represented by a lawyer to state the circumstances of the request for mediation and separation. The opposing party, Zhu Suzhen, arrived in court with her lawyer, Ma Zhongnan. According to Zhu, her husband, Wei Zhichang, is utterly unconscionable. He had married two women before and left them soon after. I am the third he has married. After we lived together, he treated me very cruelly. Now he has left me with no clothes or food, and I have no choice but to die. He had previously sued me in the local court to return his clothes, but because his reasons were insufficient, the judgment was rejected. Later, he abandoned me and did not care for me. I went to his shop to ask him for money, but he refused to pay me. Therefore, I borrowed money to live. Once, I found him eating opium at a salted meat shop in Eight Immortals Bridge.</p>
<p>There was a Woman: Leaning against him. When he saw me, he started hitting me, etc. Zhu's lawyer then said that the opposing party used to work in a silk weaving factory, and the petitioner was also an accountant in the factory at that time. They met and were seduced into adultery, and then she was taken as a concubine. Now, the petitioner's claim in the petition that Zhu was a prostitute in Yihongyuan is a complete fabrication and can be investigated. Moreover, the petitioner previously sued Zhu in the local court for the return of clothes, and the judgment has been rejected.</p>
<p>Intending to Abandon: The opposing party, etc., and submitted the court's judgment. The judge asked Zhu Suzhen if she was willing to separate from the relationship of husband and concubine. Zhu replied, "I have suffered very deeply and am willing to separate. However, I had 2,000 yuan of private savings, which he took away. If he returns the money to me now, I can separate, otherwise I cannot." At this point, the court determined that the mediation could not be established and ordered a separate lawsuit.</p>

<h3>Awards Ceremony for Storytelling Competition</h3>
<p>The Director of the Education Bureau, as Chairman, Delivers an Address of Encouragement and Awards Prizes Separately for First, Second, and Third Place</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau-sponsored storytelling competition concluded, and the awards ceremony was held yesterday (the 3rd) in the auditorium of the Municipal Public Education Hall. The meeting commenced at 9:00 AM, with the presence of Director Pan of the Education Bureau, storytellers, judges, and over two hundred guests from various sectors. Director Pan served as Chairman, with Lü Hai, Ding Shoutang, and Xing Liru as recorders. Director Pan first delivered an opening address, stating that social education is even more important than school education because everyone, regardless of gender or age, has the opportunity to receive social education at any time. In particular, the skills of the storytellers can guide the entire society, so they bear a great responsibility for social education. In the past, scholars were ashamed to associate with storytellers, which created an invisible divide. Therefore, the Bureau organized this storytelling competition to draw the attention of society to the storytellers. He put forward three points: First, one must understand one’s own responsibility; second, one must make a practical and beneficial contribution to society; and third, one must innovate and learn from the past, ensuring that the material adapts to the trends of the times. The explanation was detailed, and the audience understood it in their hearts. Then, Section Chief Chen reported on the overall situation of the competition. Subsequently, awards were presented separately. Individuals received medals, certificates, and mirror frames, while groups received mirror frames presented to the Guangyu and Yuyu societies. Then, judge Xu Shen Dai provided guidance, and guests such as Tong Xingbai, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, and Wang Houlu of the Post Office delivered speeches, encouraging the storytellers. During the awards ceremony, the storytellers cheered and applauded continuously. Finally, representatives from the Guangyu and Yuyu societies delivered speeches of thanks. The ceremony concluded at 12:00 noon, and a group photo was taken before dispersing. The following is a list of the participants' scores in this competition, arranged in order of surname strokes: (Super Grade Eleven People) Shen Jian'an, Zhang Futian, Guo Shaomei, Huang Zhaolin, Cheng Xiaofang, Zhao Xiaoqing, Zhao Jiaqiu, Liu Tianyun, Jiang Ruting, Han Shiliang, Wei Yuqing, (Grade A Twenty-Nine People), Wang Zailiang, Wang Siquan, Tian Yiliang, Zhu Jiesheng, Zhu Yaoxiang, Zhu Yaoliang, Wang Yunfeng, Li Bokang, Wu Jun'an, Yu Xiaoxia, Zhou Xiaochun, Zhou Yuquan, Xia Hesheng, Xu Yunzhi, Jiang Fengsheng, Tang Fengchun, Tang Fengqi, Lu Fengxiang, Lu Xiao Xiang, Xu Jixiang, Zhang Yunting, Tang Kangbo, Feng Zimei, Ye Shengxiang, Yang Renlin, Zhao Hesun, Zou Senzhang, Zhong Xiaonong, Wei Hanying, (Grade B Nine People), Zhu Boxiong, Li Hanzhang, Lin Shaozhang, Hu Jinfan, Ling Youxiang, Tang Zhuping, Lu Fengyi, Huang Hefeng, Zhang Yuhua, (Two Additional People) Wang Lansheng, Li Xietang.</p>
<h3>Obituary of Police Officer Yao Shaoqiu, Who Died in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu and Others Send Wreaths and Funeral Couplets</p>
<p>Yao Shaoqiu, a petitioning police officer from the Qiuxinchang Police Station, District One, Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, left work at around 7:00 PM on the 1st of this month. While passing near Zhangjia Alley outside Xiaonanmen, he was shot in the left chest by a bandit while attempting to apprehend the bandit. He fell to the ground, and the police station chief had him transported to Shanghai Hospital, but because of the serious injury, he died shortly afterward. After an investigation by personnel from the Shanghai District Court the day before yesterday, the coffin was sealed that evening. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 PM, the funeral was held. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, various organizations and groups, and various businesses in Nanshi all sent wreaths and funeral couplets, numbering no less than several hundred. The coffin departed from Shanghai Hospital, passed through Limalu to Shiliupu, turned into Dongmen Road, reached Zhonghua Road, continued south, and was temporarily placed at the Jianghuai Fellow Association outside Dananmen before being transported back to his hometown for burial. At the time, Municipal Police Bureau Director Wen Hongen, the Inspector General, the military band, police detachments from the first and second districts, and the various sub-stations, as well as the Bao'an Tuan (Security Corps), all went to hold the ropes of the hearse. It is reported that Officer Yao was twenty-three years old, a native of Yancheng in Jiangbei. He had served at the Qiuxinchang Police Station for over a year and was known for his diligence and conscientiousness in his work, earning him praise from his superiors. This time, he was tragically killed by bandits, leaving behind a widow and young children, and the situation is extremely desolate. Therefore, in addition to providing generous compensation, Director Wen has decided to prosecute the captured criminals to the fullest extent of the law in court.</p>
<h3>Butterfly Trademark Still Pending Judgment</h3>
<p>Huanan Society Requests Re-Examination</p>
<p>Huanan Chemical Industry Society previously submitted the portrait of Ms. Butterfly as a trademark and was approved by the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry. Subsequently, Family Industry Society claimed that it imitated its Invincible brand and Butterfly Chinese and Western characters trademarks and filed an objection. The Trademark Bureau ruled to revoke the Butterfly trademark. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Subsequently, Huanan Chemical Industry Society stated that the Butterfly trademark with the portrait of Ms. Butterfly had no possibility of confusion with the Invincible brand trademark and that the Butterfly Chinese and Western characters were submitted for approval after the society's approval. It cannot be used to oppose it. Therefore, it disagreed with the Trademark Bureau's ruling and requested that another committee be appointed to review it fairly according to legal procedures. The petition was several thousand words long, detailing the situation and providing sufficient reasons. It is still difficult to predict who will be right and wrong in the future.</p>

There were more than 300 students in two sessions. Now the results of the first session have been published in this newspaper every month.

<h3>Mr. Ye Dakang's Letter December 3, 21st Year.</h3>
<p>Regarding the two questions raised by Ms. Zhang Yunqiu yesterday: (1) Why do countless couples fall from the boiling point of love to zero degrees? And (2) What methods can be used to remedy such a tragedy? I think it is very worthwhile to discuss because this phenomenon is really too common.</p>
<p>This question is certainly not one that can be answered by one person, but since your newspaper has submitted this question for everyone to discuss, I can also contribute my experience and opinions here.</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, I think this is a natural trend, just like the spring inside a clock. After being wound tightly, it will naturally loosen after running for twenty-four hours, which is not surprising. According to this theory, the way to remedy it is naturally only to "wind it up a few more times." How to wind it? Based on my experience, if a couple often has short separations, it can especially increase their love. As the saying goes: "New marriage is not as good as a long separation." Why is new marriage not as good as a long separation? This is the reason for not letting the spring loosen in one breath. So I think that the way to remedy it is to often have short separations, which is also a method.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wu Jianqiu's Letter December 3, 21st Year.</h3>
<p>I feel that everyone should participate in the discussion on the two questions raised by Ms. Zhang Yunqiu yesterday.</p>
<p>My opinion is: (1) It is very common for countless couples to fall from the boiling point of love to zero degrees. Couples who are already married or even have children cannot naturally be as intense as in the days of first love. If a young couple is "good brother" and "good sister" all day long, inseparable, twisted into a pile like a wedding candy, what would it be? However, it would be too terrible to go from the boiling point to the freezing point. As for the method of remedy, I remember that Mr. Zhang Boling once said: "If a wife can often change into a new dress, it can also increase the love between husband and wife." Although Mr. Zhang's remark was just a casual joke, I think it also makes sense. I will pass on Mr. Zhang's opinion for everyone to refer to and try!</p>
<p>Reporter's Note: The two questions raised by Ms. Zhang are indeed very worthy of discussion. The letters from the above two gentlemen, Ye and Wu, are only an "opinion" and not a "conclusion." I hope that all the good men and women in the world will actively express their opinions. This is not for others, but for yourselves.</p>
<h3>Mr. Liu Jue's Letter December 3, 21st Year</h3>
<p>The recent case in which the Anhui Fellow Association accused the disaster relief committee of Cha Mianzhong and others is very worthy of attention, but as of now, it does not seem to have caused any reaction in society.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, I now have three questions, and I would like to ask your newspaper to take the trouble to give me a public reply:</p>
<p>(1) What exactly is this case about? What is the inside story?</p>
<p>(2) If the investigation is not factual, then those who are enthusiastic about public welfare will stop. How should those who make false accusations be punished?</p>
<p>(3) If the investigation is all factual, then how should Cha Mianzhong and others be punished?</p>
<p>Reporter's Note: Regarding the two questions (2) and (3), please everyone participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>Sun Yuanjun, a descendant of Sun, has a deep family tradition and profound medical skills. Now, for the convenience of patients, he has set up a clinic at No. 2 Yilong, Shipingxing, Zhuhang Wharf in the two cities. It is recently heard that many people have gone to see him.</p>

Because Mr. Wang wants to train midwifery talents, he co-founded the Cihang Midwifery School with Mr. Song Diansheng at the intersection of Lizhou Road and Wuding Road. Since its opening, the school's affairs have gradually developed, and some people have come to Shanghai from afar to enroll in the school. Due to the large increase in students, the original classrooms and teachers are not enough. It is now actively expanding and hiring many well-known medical doctors from Shanghai to serve as translators and instructors every day. There is also the Cihang Midwifery Hospital for students to practice clinical experience. It is heard that the school still has vacancies, and those who aspire to learn this can go to register.</p>

<p>Lanzhou, 3rd dispatch: The middle school strike in Lanzhou has not been completely resolved. Due to lack of funds, elementary schools went on strike on the 1st.</p>
<h3>National Central University Establishes Scholarship</h3>
<p>Luo Jialun Discusses the Significance and Hopes for its Establishment Nanjing, 3rd dispatch: The National Central University has announced provisional scholarship regulations. President Luo Jialun spoke with reporters about the significance of establishing the scholarship and his hopes as follows: At this time of financial difficulty, the establishment of a large number of scholarships by National Central University demonstrates the greatest determination to promote scholarship and provide relief to students. When I was at Tsinghua University, there was also a scholarship system, which was specifically designed to provide relief to poor and studious students, but it is not easy to investigate the actual situation of students' poverty. If there are mistakes, it will cause more difficulties. Therefore, it is better to have open competition so that poor scholars can seek financial compensation based on their academic performance under the open competition system. Even if non-poor scholars win the scholarship, it is still an academic honor. Viewed from the perspective of promoting the arts, there is nothing wrong with it. After repeated long-term discussions at the university affairs meeting, it was concluded that all disciplines should be equally encouraged, so the department is used as the unit. However, the number of scholarships is seventy per semester and one hundred and forty per academic year. There are currently only 1,360 formal students at National Central University, which means that more than 10% of the students can receive scholarships each academic year, which is a huge number. I only hope that students will work hard to study and pay attention to their studies in the future. For examinations, jointly establish a spirit of absolute integrity, and professors should carefully assess performance and strive for fairness. Only then can the spirit of this initiative be fully realized. This scholarship focuses on rewarding students' daily studies because it is the foundation for all future in-depth research. The categories for the study of specialized problems are very numerous, and this university cannot take care of them all at once. I hope that people from all walks of life who have a special interest in a certain problem and want to promote it, such as foreigners, will donate special scholarships to the university at any time.</p>

<h3>Shandong Student Unrest Has Not Yet Subsided</h3>
<p>High School Students Still Did Not Attend Classes Yesterday Demanding Unconditional Return of Expelled Students</p>
<p>Why Talk About Irreversibility Han Talks About Students Obeying Orders to Attend Classes to Avoid Prosecution</p>
<p>Jinan, 3rd dispatch: He Siyuan said that expelled high school students must submit a letter of repentance and obey the examination before being allowed to return to school. Those who instigated the unrest must be identified and planned to be persuaded to attend classes again on Monday.</p>
<p>High school students still did not attend classes today. The teachers and staff of the department gathered the students to persuade them to attend classes. The students demanded: 1. The expelled third-year students must return to school unconditionally. 2. First and second-year students are guaranteed not to suffer any sacrifice, that is, to attend classes. However, third-year students must be identified and submit a letter of repentance before they can return to school. The Education Department is handling the matter according to the provincial order, and it is feared that it will be difficult to withdraw the order.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government ordered the Education Department: In order to issue instructions, I recently received a winter telegram from the Executive Yuan, stating that according to the Ministry of Education, He Siyuan, Director of the Shandong Education Department, repeatedly telegraphed that thousands of secondary school students in Jinan gathered to petition the provincial government and the provincial party department and issued a declaration opposing the graduation examination. The situation is serious. In addition to telegraphing the director of the department to earnestly implement the examination and not be lenient, the Shandong Provincial Government should be ordered to strictly prohibit and punish the students who took the lead in order to rectify the school spirit, etc., arrived at the Yuan. It has been found that the middle school graduation examination is an order issued by the Ministry of Education to all provinces. How can some students in the province wantonly oppose it? The department should immediately be ordered by the provincial government to strictly prohibit it, punish the leading students, and rectify the school spirit, etc. In addition to replying by telegram, the department should be ordered to earnestly comply with and report back for investigation and not violate this order.</p>
<p>Han talked about the fact that the academy ordered strict handling of the student unrest, but if the students obeyed the order to go to work, they could not be prosecuted.</p>

<p>丨Chinese Walking Association Meeting丨</p>
<p>The Chinese Walking Association held a joint meeting of racers, introducers, and referees at its headquarters today. Attendees included Shi Youhui, Zhou Yuyu, Yu Zichen, He Borong, and more than forty others. The meeting began at 2 PM, chaired by Shi Youhui and recorded by Lu Yutian. The chairman first reported that foreigners are greatly ashamed because our China has won the championship for four consecutive years, so they have come up with various methods in this session to contain and restrict us, reducing our strength, such as limiting the participation of Chinese people, firstly, prohibiting the wearing of rubber shoes without heels, secondly, and not allowing introducers to crowd together, preventing the latter from advancing, thirdly. In short, foreigners intend to take our championship by this means. It was also rumored that Mr. Zhou Yuyu was about to withdraw. Now, Zhou was persuaded by Yu and Lu Yutian, Fu Zichen, and Zhang Zaocun Shi Jinsheng and others to consider the overall situation, still able to attend with illness, to vent anger for our China and maintain the championship. Even if physical strength is not added and is slightly late, people can also forgive it, and so on. Then discussed as follows, if the introducer cannot attend due to business, please determine another one as soon as possible to facilitate the race at that time, and change immediately, five or six people. Furthermore, the responsibility of the introducer is very important, and it is related to the excellent performance of the racer. Therefore, when introducing, in addition to taking care along the way, the time must be reported every mile so that the racer can be clear and can speed up or slow down the pace to rest. At the small turning point, it is necessary to take care of the racer to cross the road diagonally, but it is not allowed to use the turning point to run and jump over to prevent being punished. When the racers are tired, it is necessary to drink and sing the pace one two one two, or left and right and so on, continue to sing down to show encouragement. In this conference, the referees, in addition to wearing green ribbons, also have red white base "Judge" words, have the power to punish racers, all our Chinese team members, pay attention to it, and introducers must report to the racers at any time, when surpassing other racers, regardless of Chinese or foreign, it is never allowed to look back, even if it is not conceited, the loser will eventually feel despised. Next, distribute referee ribbons, armbands, special issues, and passes. This year, the Chinese Jockey Club also generously agreed to borrow, and I hope that our Chinese team members and staff will gather upstairs at 7:15 this morning (in order to contact everything, and change clothes, etc., to each mile point, handled by Mr. Aegis, but this time, because the Boy Scouts happened to be in charge of aviation propaganda, it was not possible to fulfill the wish, so I changed to invite seventeen students from Arabaidstulu Shanghai Elementary School to stand with flags to facilitate the competition of the racers.</p>

<p>Stout Cup Two-Week Competition</p>
<h3>Jinan Eliminates Donghua</h3>
<p>One to Zero, the situation is extremely intense and the actions are rough and terrible.</p>
<p>Open and secret arrows retaliate for grievances, which is by no means a good situation.</p>
<p>丨West Police Force and French Business School Tie Five to Five丨</p>
<p>丨Agaer Eliminates Elementary Level with Ten to Zero丨</p>
<p>Luo Haiguang's header breaks through the Donghua goal, resulting in Jinan defeating Donghua with a score of one to zero.</p>
<p>In the Stout Cup, Donghua was eliminated.</p>
<p>Jinan people in the second week of the competition, yesterday after the rain cleared up, there were few spectators on the baseball field. The overall situation of this battle almost fell into a confrontation of public anger and private revenge, with the possibility of triggering force. Many spectators also scolded the Jinan players for their unworthiness of Donghua players, which was despicable and vulgar, and self-degrading. It is a pity, it is a pity. As for the rough actions of the Jinan players, it was the main reason for arousing public anger. However, Donghua should not be allowed to be arrogant. Both sides have considerable blame. However, one is an open gun and the other is a secret sword. It is not a good situation to fight each other. However, the guidance of the fire line started from the injury of the secret arrow. The two sides already had a rift at the dinner party of Mayor Wu the night before. The reason is that the reporter is really inconvenient to repeat more to avoid further inciting trouble. It is hoped that both sides will donate their prejudices and return to their old friendship, and strive for technical competition to win glory for my China.</p>
<p>The Overall Situation is Grim</p>
<p>Yesterday, the field was muddy and inconvenient for Yi to run and compete, so the situation was equal, each relying on luck.</p>
<p>Ten minutes into the start, Jinan scored through Luo Haiguang's header from Liu Zukan's cross, becoming the focus of resolving the victory or defeat.</p>
<p>After that, Jinan had many shots on goal, either high or wide, but none of them were on target. Even if there were, they were saved by Zhou Xianyan.</p>
<p>Once, Chen Zhenhe shot hard, Zhou caught the ball and fell to the ground. Chen Zhenxiang, Mei Hongbao rushed up and kicked Zhou Xianyan's body indiscriminately, the situation was dangerous, and the referee ordered a free kick.</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan argued with Chen Zhenxiang, and Zhuang Shihong joined the vortex. The two sides had the intention of using force. Chen Zhenhe, Jiang Shanjing, and the referee tried their best to mediate before it stopped. However, the situation after that was almost completely in a rough state of fierce rushing and tripping, and the game was thus reduced in color.</p>
<p>In the second half, Donghua had two chances, one was Chen Hongguang's fierce shot, the ball went into the arms of Jinan goalkeeper Xie Quanhe, and the other was Li Yichen's dribbling into the unmanned area, Xie Quanhe failed to save and fell to the ground, and Li also fell to the ground at the same time, the ball rolled forward and went out of bounds along the goalpost.</p>
<p>These two goals not being scored were Jinan's great fortune, but Xie Quanhe's special care yesterday, and strict precautions are also the reason why Jinan was not defeated.</p>
<p>The Situation in the First Half</p>
<p>At three o'clock, the war clouds were densely covered. Jinan took the lead and kicked off several times, but there was no tense situation. Although there were charges and battles, both sides had no achievements.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Liu Zukan, Jinan's left winger, shot a ball to the front of the Donghua goal, and center Luo Haiguang stepped forward and headed it in, which was the first great achievement.</p>
<p>Donghua's loss of the ball was not due to Zhou Xianyan's failure to save it, but to the accident of Zha Xun'an's fall.</p>
<p>Since then, the two sides have still been in a chaotic situation. Although Donghua had two corner kicks, Li Yichen and others tried their best to attack the goal, but they were helpless and only shouted in vain.</p>
<p>Then saw Jinan Chen Zhenhe and Luo Haiguang approach and attack the goal, Zhenhe shot hard and the ball was caught by Zhou Xianyan, but the ground was slippery and he fell to the ground holding the ball, Chen Zhenxiang and Mei Hong冲上去踼之, the situation was very dangerous, the referee blew the whistle to relieve the danger and penalized Jinan a free kick, from then on, each side held prejudices and acted wilfully, and the ball battle fell into a bad situation.</p>
<p>Jinan shot several times without success, Donghua advanced into the Central Plains, Xie Quanhe blocked Li Yichen's shot, Chen Yutian ambushed by the door, took advantage of his sharp hand to kick the ball into the goal, the audience clapped their hands and celebrated the success, but it was offside and the judgment was invalidated, which was the situation in the first half.</p>
<p>The Situation in the Second Half</p>
<p>After the break, the whistle sounded again, and the ball was moved, and the ball entered Jinan's hands, Chen Zhenhe ran hard and dribbled near the goal, fearing that he would lose his success in one fell swoop, and kicked in a hurry, before he could use his strength, it was steadily saved by Zhou Tie.</p>
<p>Donghua's formation gradually became scattered after that, and at this point, Jinan was repeatedly warned by the referee for improper actions, so the two sides became more and more deteriorated, pushing and shoving fouls, each saw it, the audience's voice was also very bad.</p>
<p>After Chen Yutian of Donghua failed to attack the goal once, he dribbled the ball and quickly passed it to the Jinan goal, Hongguang shot quickly, but unfortunately, he happened to enter the goalkeeper's arms again, and the success was defeated at the last moment. After a period of mixed battles, Qian Jingyi passed a ball to the front of the Jinan goal, Xie goalkeeper fell to the ground, and Li Yichen took the opportunity to dribble the ball forward, but he also lost his footing and fell, the situation was so tense, the ball rolled slowly forward, and it was seen that it must be hit, but it hit 余裏去了, the audience could not help but stamp their feet and sigh.</p>
<p>Seeing that the twilight was deep and the time was about to end, the entire army of Qiu Hua rushed into the enemy camp and fought against the city with one heart and one mind. Jinan also retreated to defend the whole army, hoping to maintain the final situation. In the melee, Jinan finally won with a score of one to zero, and Donghua suffered the tragic situation of the first failure.</p>

<p>After the game, fearing that the fans would cause trouble, the police specially sent a large number of police officers to guard in front of the Association, surrounded the surroundings of the bus that the Jinan team took, protected the players on the bus and drove away, the situation was quite serious, and the police car escorted them out of Malong Road, and the audience dispersed disgruntledly.</p>

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Wedding Night (3)</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>In fact, this is not a big deal. What struck Miss Xiu the most was when her mother gave birth to her youngest sister. It took a day and two nights, but the child still didn't come out. She personally saw from the crack in the door the various situations of her mother rolling around in pain, shouting loudly, and crying with tears streaming down her face. She just felt chills down her spine. What made her especially scared was hearing that this time the child came down with feet first and head last. This was really too dangerous. Anyone who heard it would stick out their tongue. Not to mention Miss Xiu. Her fear and aversion to childbirth were simply indescribable. From then on, she made up her mind never to marry and dreamed of her single life day and night.</p>
<p>It was really too strange. No one could have imagined that in just half a year, she would marry an old husband who was forty-eight years old, short in stature, with yellowish-black skin, countless wrinkles, and a face that looked completely like a monkey. Others naturally couldn't understand Miss Xiu's pain and only felt that "a fresh flower was stuck in cow dung" (Note 3), which was a bit of a pity. However, her parents felt nothing but glory and happiness and were simply completely satisfied. This was naturally because the son-in-law was an only son, and the family property was well-off. In addition, the son-in-law was diligent and thrifty and could earn money. It was said that he might even become a rich man in the future. This was equivalent to the daughter's property, which would be used for her whole life in the future. The responsibility of being a parent was to marry off their daughter. Being able to marry a daughter to a son-in-law with family property was, in their eyes, a model of a benevolent father. Although the son-in-law was thirty-two years older than the daughter, the matchmaker's face was too great to refuse, and what did it matter? A man should be older than a woman.</p>
<p>"Although Xiu'er's marriage is good, I just think that man is a little too old and unmatched," Miss Xiu's mother said with emotion one day.</p>
<p>"What's unmatched? It's good that he's a little older so he can take care of her. As the saying goes, 'Marrying an old man is like getting a treasure, marrying a young man is like getting a weed' (Note 4). Moreover, even if he becomes rich in the future, you don't have to worry about him marrying a concubine. Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>"Amitabha, you're thinking so far ahead, just"</p>
<p>"Two years older is nothing to worry about, thirty-two years older is really too much. Do you think she can live her current life?"</p>
<p>After all, she was a kind mother, and she actually started to cry.</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous, what's there to cry about? It's not like sending her to the tiger's mouth. Even if he's forty-eight, fifty-eight, or sixty-eight, what does it matter? Don't you know that Old Master Fu in Wangjia Chong is seventy-five years old and still wants to marry a fourteen-year-old girl as a concubine? Isn't that girl still human!"</p>
<p>Miss Xiu's father was originally a kind person, but for some reason, he had been arguing with his wife lately about his daughter's marriage. Every time he said a few words, he would get angry. Today was the same. Not only was his attitude bad, but his tone was also particularly sharp, probably because he had just had some wine.</p>
<p>"That's not right, it's immoral!"</p>
<p>After a long pause, Miss Xiu's mother said this timidly as if in protest.</p>
<p>"What's immoral? It's not like killing her and cooking her for wine."</p>
<p>"Humph! It's more terrifying than killing her!"</p>
<p>"Look, when Xiu'er marries over there in the future, as long as they consummate the marriage, I guarantee you won't have any problems."</p>
<p>"Humph! You wait and see!"</p>
<h3>Anger</h3>
<p>Laugh for a while, cry for a while, unrestrained, unconcerned, carefree, count me as comfortable. But looking at the present, thinking about the past, suddenly a whim, and deeply feel that crying and laughing are not right, then immediately stop laughing and stop crying, stirring up a ten-thousand-zhang nameless fire of anger.</p>
<p>Anger, how ugly! Face full of red, eyebrows vertical eyes horizontal, rubbing fists and wiping palms, fierce, like a living demon king out of the world, naturally there is no modesty so elegant and gentle, so peaceful and good-looking.</p>
<p>But humility must also have a limit. If in your home, you know that someone is coming to rob today, and someone is coming to rape tomorrow, making it uneasy to eat and uneasy to sleep, you also elegantly and gently, peacefully and good-looking, make a bow, bow, and even kowtow three times, "Good heroes, little student is being polite here," is there any reason in the world? I can't!</p>
<p>Even our ancestors, although they have always lived in the land of etiquette, were not without "anger". Look: "Angry hair rising up to the crown," what a majestic look! "Shouting to cut off the Ba River," what a scary thing! As for "One anger and the princes fear," "One anger and peace the people of the world," that is even more deeply related to the safety of the world and can be regarded as a model of anger. Therefore, even if we occasionally get a little angry, although it is inevitable that it is a little ugly, it does not hurt the overall situation, and it will never become an unfilial descendant.</p>
<p>However, anger must also be appropriate, and it should not be unreasonable, and it should not be hard-mouthed and empty-hearted. When Zhang Laoer brothers don't agree with each other, they immediately get red eyes and fight, which is called unreasonable trouble; Wang Danian was robbed, scared to hide in the quilt and dare not breathe, and after the robber left, she cried and scolded the murderous thieves at the gate, which is called hard-mouthed and empty-hearted.</p>
<p>However, there are too many Zhang Laoer and Wang Dalian of our noble country in front of us, alas and sigh, "One anger and peace the people of the world," if this anger does not come out, what will the country do?</p>
<h3>Kingdom of Children</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>"England is the kingdom of children," Yukio Tsurumi of Japan once said this.</p>
<p>Really, all of England's social life is centered on children. If we go to a bookstore in London, then we can find piles of children's books displayed there. Fairy tales are also mostly from England, it can be said that except for Andersen alone, many fairy tales come from England.</p>
<p>Ordinary Londoners are very fond of children. In terms of preserving the human race, they have a very high respect for the personality of children. Even in poor families, there will be a children's room. This room is a sacred area, and children become true sovereigns. Of course, that is the kingdom of children. Adults entering this kingdom must be very respectful and solemn.</p>
<p>Most families in London have a small garden, and it is also not uncommon to have piano or lawn tennis court facilities. Also, because London is always smoky, which hinders the physical development of children, many people want to move to the suburbs, so that children can get as close as possible to nature. This is of course a reflection of the psychology of caring for children.</p>
<p>English children's mothers, in order to make their children the successors of the English nation, do not spare their efforts to train their children in the wind, frost, cold and heat, hoping that they will erect the flag of the British Empire on the ice island of Antarctica. Therefore, there is often a kind of respect between mother and child, but perhaps it is also a kind of estrangement: the result is the formation of an opposition between two personalities.</p>
<h3>The Current Status of German Women</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>Speaking of German women, one cannot help but be amazed. They possess the courageous spirit and the perseverance of French women, yet they are more reserved than their French counterparts. They finally gained suffrage after the war, but it was not easily obtained; they struggled greatly. Like the women's movement in any country, the primary goal is to improve the status of women and create new environments for them, and the German women's movement is no exception.</p>
<p>In 1908, as a result of the women's movement, German universities were opened, and women were free to attend lectures, unlike before, when they were restricted. At the same time, as long as a woman had skills, she could occupy a higher position in any industry. This can be said to be the first stage of the German women's movement. However, the rapid change in the status of German women occurred during the European War. At that time, men, young and old, went to the front lines to fight. All that remained were women. What kind of work were they good at? What kind of work were they interested in? In this emergency, they had no room for consideration, so they bravely took the place of all men, even in manufacturing military supplies, driving cars, and other extremely heavy work. They were able to operate freely, just like men. From then on, not only did they break the long-standing habit of underestimating women, but they also created a glorious page in the history of the women's world. This is the second stage of the German women's movement.</p>
<p>When the European War ended, a group of veterans returned from the front lines, hoping that women would return to their families and give up their positions. However, they had experienced the taste of work, achieved considerable success, and felt the interest in it. They were unwilling to simply remain at home. In particular, women from the intellectual and leisure classes were even more unwilling to spend their days in the same boring life as before, so their desire for work became even more intense. In addition, as a result of the fifty-two-month war, the people of Germany were plunged into bankruptcy, and a group of widows and orphans had no choice but to seek employment to maintain their survival. At the same time, more than half of the men died for their country on the battlefield, resulting in women outnumbering men by nearly three million, which led to difficulties in women finding marriage partners. Since women could not find spouses, they had to make a living, so many female soldiers were added to the workforce. According to the facts, German women are not only able to take on all kinds of tasks, but also able to jointly shoulder the responsibility of national economic revival with men. They also have considerable ability in administrative aspects. By this time, everyone had gradually recognized the possibility of women's participation in politics. However, most people still held a lukewarm attitude, and thought that women's duties were only to handle household affairs, and there was no need for them to participate in politics. Therefore, the women's suffrage movement became even more heated. As a result, the German Parliament finally passed a resolution in 1918 to grant women the right to vote, and the following year, the German Constitution clearly included the provision that women have the right to vote and to be elected. This is a rough overview of the changes in the status of German women after the European War.</p>
<h3>Street Scene in Early Winter</h3>
<p>— Xingzi</p>
<p>The cold wind has driven away the autumn, which still carried a hint of warmth, and brought a deeper coldness. At this time, early winter, which makes the poor panic, has arrived! The streets of early winter are particularly lively all day long, but on the other hand, they are also particularly desolate. Laughter is mixed with crying, champagne glasses are soaked with blood and tears, which is precisely the foundation of modern cities, and also precisely the symphony that is indispensable in modern cities.</p>
<p>Let's take Nanjing Road as an example:</p>
<p>The sound of drums and music jingles on both sides, and large banners flutter in the middle of the road. And when night falls, the red and green electric lights make people's eyes dazzled and their minds flutter. This is the seasonal hawking of early winter. The glass windows of large department stores are full of fox legs, mink furs, warm and delicate Parisian wools... This is the seasonal winter clothing. Every company and store opens its bloody mouth, and the "heroes" constantly squeeze, chase, and roll in and out. Everyone has a pair of greedy eyes and a ferocious mask, ready to seize the flesh and blood of others and pretend to be happy themselves.</p>
<p>Cars constantly shuttle back and forth, carrying the "heroes" returning in triumph, so the streets are often filled with yellow dust, showing a particularly lively scene.</p>
<p>But, if the time is in the middle of the night, the streets change into a different world.</p>
<p>The street is like a dead snake, sleeping silently. The faint streetlights shine on the snake's back, and the cold wind blows from the darkness, weaving into a net of death. At this time, the hawking girls, like ghosts, tremble under the cold lamplight. And in the dark corners, the weak curl up, like dogs, with the whips of hunger and cold lashing their bodies mercilessly. Subdued sobs and mournful moans turn the streets into a living hell.</p>
<p>Winter has come, and the poor are panicking, but isn't the end of winter spring? The arrival of spring is probably not far away!</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of Era and Love, Part Four</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>While thinking, he tore open his sister's letter to read. He learned that his brother-in-law's job had been handed over two weeks ago. Haiquan's brother-in-law, Liu Weiying, through the introduction of his old classmates and the use of some bribes, had served as the director of the ×× Tax Bureau in Guangzhou for more than a year. When Haiquan was still in Guangzhou, he had heard people say that this ×× Tax Bureau was a very good position, but it could not be occupied for long. Now it seems that their prediction has been realized. His sister's letter also said that his brother-in-law didn't want to stay in the south anymore, and might come to Nanjing after the New Year to look for a job. Then, at that time, they might live in Shanghai, and they could see each other often. After reading his sister's letter, he slowly tore open Liu Peizhu's letter to read. He learned that his brother-in-law had been dismissed on suspicion of embezzling public funds. The content of her letter was written like this.</p>
<p>"Mr. Haiquan,!! You have written to me several times, not allowing me to address you as such, but I still address you this way. Although I am willing to do what you ask of me, at present, I simply don't have the courage!! It's not that I have forgotten the previous agreement!! I also feel very embarrassed to open my mouth to you, and even more embarrassed to write it down. I hope you won't be as suspicious as you were in Guangzhou, and constantly promote your theory of exclusive love. Our friendship only seeks mutual sincerity, and doesn't need those formal expressions, right?</p>
<p>"Have you met Sister Zhen in Shanghai? She is a formalist, and has the life and attitude of a thorough bourgeois. I hope you won't mention anything about us in front of her. Because she will definitely oppose our union. As for the reason, it's not just because she is an extreme reactionary against free love, but also because she is extremely sensitive about our!! especially your, material life, and harbors a kind of disdain. In short, love is supreme, beyond everything. However, sometimes it is helpless, and we have to be dominated by the environment,!! especially by the economy. Of course, I am not advocating that the economy will dominate our love. I only hope that Haiquan will pay attention to this point, and work harder to break the unfree environment of our love.</p>
<p>"If we can't open up this free path, a free path that is sufficient to promote the progress of our love, then even if we hastily unite, in the future, in life, we will still be extremely struggling and extremely painful, right?</p>
<p>"On my sister's side, no matter what, you should go there once a month to perfunctorily deal with them. Even if you don't like their character, and don't want to see their life. But in human society, it is impossible to seek things and people that completely fit one's own ideals, right? Because I know your aloof and cynical temperament, I dare to give you this piece of advice. If you sincerely get closer to them, then you will definitely be able to move them. Then, you can also reduce the resistance to our future union. To be fair, Sister Zhen is just a bit arrogant. As for her heart, it is still extremely pure and kind, just like my mother. Unfortunately, her temper and attitude are similar to my father.</p>
<p>"My brother's ×× Director has been dismissed, fortunately without investigation. This is entirely due to the power of Commander Huang. What I told you before has come true. My brother is a petty corrupt official. He already has a lot of money, and is happy to step down. I heard that he will go to Nanjing next spring to look for a ××× Director. I regret that I can't graduate for a while, otherwise I would immediately go to Shanghai with them to discuss the issue of schooling with you.!! I might drop this boring women's normal school in Guangzhou and immediately come to Shanghai to discuss the issue of schooling with you."</p>

<h3>Financial Turmoil Has Not Yet Subsided</h3>
<h3>Ten Taels Difference in Half a Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation was still confusing, with incessant waves. There was a difference of ten taels in half a day. In the end, it continued to fall by 2.2 taels. Fellow traders were again seeking supply in a chaotic manner. Early in the morning, 810 taels were re-emerging, due to the decline in the silver market and exchange rates, as well as the report of a drop of more than ten pounds in American cotton. Subsequently, a new high point was discovered repeatedly, reaching 814.1 taels. After that, foreign exchange initially rose and then loosened. Sellers on the table outnumbered buyers, so the price of gold fell by ten taels, with three or four taels of hidden potential in the middle. Afterwards, it was calculated to be around 804 taels.

As a result, compared to the previous day, the British pound increased by 125 and the US dollar only increased by 0.0625. This was due to the small recovery of exchange rates. Transactions in various banks were not very lively, with only tens of thousands of pounds of British pounds being traded.

Generally speaking, the morning market was more繁(fán - busy), while the afternoon market was懈(xiè - relaxed). Regarding settlements, due to it being Saturday and the banks being closed in the afternoon, many procedures could not be processed in time, so they were slightly less than usual.

<h3>Securities Will Be Auctioned Next Week; Financial Short-Term Government Bonds Continued to Fall by Two Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>The amount of the twenty-year financial short-term government bonds is 80 million. After revision, the interest rate was changed to 6%, and interest was paid once every three months. Principal will be repaid every year through lottery redemption, and will be repaid in full in ten years. Since its issuance, the creditworthiness of the bond has been very good, the current price is quite high, and there is a lot of circulation in the market. In order to facilitate the market, the Securities Exchange has agreed to start making spot and futures trading from next week. It is expected that after the auction starts, it will have a considerable position in the market. As for yesterday, the spot transactions were still sparse, and the market price fluctuated greatly. The market situation was still strong. The transactions of various bonds were as active as before, and the changes in the prices of various bonds were due to the chaotic market conditions and the uncertainty of the people, the price fluctuated suddenly according to the supply and demand situation in the market, rising and falling very sharply, but the selling atmosphere was still stronger, and the price continued to fall more sharply than before. As a result, compared with the previous day, the spot and futures for this month were reduced by two yuan and several angles, and the long-term futures and Fengshui January futures also fell by one yuan and nine angles, and the others also fell by seven or eight angles to one yuan and several angles. It is heard that the drop in market prices is also related to the tightening situation in the Northeast.

<h3>New York Stock Market Fell Again</h3>

Professional speculators sold a lot, waiting for the result of the war bond maturing on the 15th. However, most bulls did not sell, so trading was still not active. The total daily trading volume was only 700,000 shares, and gold stocks alone were strong. According to New York telegram, silver plummeted to a new low of 2.5 cents per ounce. There are currently 20 million ounces of silver in New York City, and 8 million ounces will be shipped to the Far East this month. The Jones index is listed on the left</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth Market Entered a Sluggish Phase Again</h3>
<p>丨American Cotton and Gold Prices Both Fell丨</p>
<p>丨General Psychology is Bearish丨</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has become sluggish again, because American cotton has fallen, and gold prices have fallen slightly, causing people's minds to be scattered. The actual demand in the market is sluggish, and most people are selling and viewing low. However, the bottom is already small, and rebounds are easy to cause. The future of the yarn market, with the gold rush in it, is difficult to grasp.</p>
<h3>Human Index Selling Pressure is Stronger</h3>
<p>The human index opened in the morning market. Although American cotton fell, gold prices were still high, so the market was still flat. By the close, the market atmosphere was slightly looser, with each month falling by two, three, four, and five cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that gold prices had fallen slightly, and the selling pressure was stronger, with each month falling by another two or three cents. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 13,000 bales. It was found that Yiyu sold 1,200 bales, Changfeng 650 bales, and Mingde 400 bales. Tonghe bought 700 bales, Yantai 600 bales, Rongxing 650 bales, Heshen 550 bales, and Gengfeng 450 bales. The closing prices are listed below</p>

<h3>Yarn Sales Were Still Quiet</h3>

<h3>Cotton Market Declined Slightly</h3>
<p>丨Manufacturers had no intention of buying to cover short positions丨</p>
<p>The cotton market has declined slightly, because American cotton has tended to fall, and the gold market has suddenly risen and fallen, making people's minds unsettled. However, the factory demand is still sluggish, so a certain manufacturer threw out a large amount of quota, with absolutely no intention of buying back to cover short positions. However, buyers believe that although gold prices are small, the foreign cotton converted silver price is still high, and the sources from various roads have been depleted, and there are not a few多者(duō zhě - bull).</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Suffers a Small Setback Against Qian Xu</h3>
<p>Before the market opened in Zheng Biao's sector, although foreign cotton prices had fallen, the market atmosphere was still able to maintain itself due to the instability of the gold market. By closing time, prices had fallen by one to two qian. The market atmosphere was flat in the afternoon. The total daily transaction volume was 33,700 dan. Sales included 4,400 dan of Geng Feng, 1,000 dan of Ming De, 1,300 dan of Chang Feng, 1,600 dan of Shen Ji, and 1,100 dan of Yi Yu.

<p>Total 712.200</p>
<h3>Cotton Mills Handling Light Business</h3>
<p>The raw cotton business remains sluggish. Various mills report that the yarn market is unlikely to improve, so they are purchasing less raw cotton. The sources are estimated to be 199 bales of Yao cotton and 860 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 32.00 31.25 Yong'an Mill purchased 600 pieces. Sent to the mill Ling Shi Bao Cotton 36.50 Another 87 pieces. Also Tianjin American cotton 34.00 Qing Feng Mill purchased 125 pieces. Sent to Wuxi.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Falls More Than Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to political news favoring short positions, Southern hedging, and a lack of buyers. Futures fell 9 to 16 points, and spot prices fell 15 points. British cotton futures fell 1 to 3 points, and spot prices rose 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 3 points. Indian cotton was firm due to buying by brokers and speculators. Pingguo'er rose 1.25 rupees, Aomula rose 0.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is on the left. (2nd day telegram)</p>

<h3>American Cotton Affected by Gold Pound, Lost Its Stability in the Past Week</h3>
<p>A New York telegram on the 2nd reported on the cotton market during the week. The war debt issue has not been reversed, and the gold pound has depreciated, causing the cotton market to lose its stability in the past week. The first notice quantity for December was 40,000 bales, all of which were taken by important spot traders. It is said that 10,000 bales will be shipped to Europe. The decline in the cotton market is not only due to the above reasons, but also directly related to the liquidation of large long positions. However, Southern hedging is very small. Recent private estimates are sufficient to strengthen the current public impression that the next government report will exceed 12 million bales. The textile market is unusually slack, so buyers are concerned that demand is limited and are generally waiting for developments.</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Market Weakens</h3>
<p>丨Foreign Wheat and American Wheat Both Fall Back丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, various months turned to a declining trend. The quotations for foreign wheat and American wheat fell by 2, 3, 4, and 6 jiao, respectively. The extreme highs of the previous day were inevitably impulsive at this point. Therefore, after the opening prices, the market in various months was sluggish, losing slightly more than one fen compared to the previous day's closing price. The market remained unstable in subsequent sessions. When the afternoon session opened, sentiment remained poor, falling nearly one fen compared to the morning. However, after the second session, it gradually strengthened again. Currently, there are still inquiries about the sales of spot flour. The factories have very thin inventories, and the rising gold market has somewhat affected the continued ordering of foreign wheat. Therefore, sentiment is improving, and progress is steady. However, the continued ordering of foreign flour in Tianjin will strike a blow to flour sales at the beginning of the year. As a result, the current month fell by 5 li compared to the previous day, January fell by 1 fen 2.5 li, February fell by 1 fen 5 li, March and April fell by 1 fen, and May fell by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Sellers Dominate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market in various months generally turned to a declining trend. As foreign wheat had fallen back by 2, 3, 4, and 6 jiao, the bullish atmosphere of the previous day inevitably weakened. Because traders had sold off when prices rose sharply the previous day, their holdings were slightly larger. Trading was more subdued yesterday, but sellers dominated, and prices fell at the opening. Future movements should be watched based on foreign wheat. As a result, January fell slightly by 1 fen, March fell by 4 fen, and April fell by 5 fen. There are no comparisons for the rest.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Weakens</h3>
<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm (2nd day): Chicago wheat fell by 1.125 to 1.75 cents due to profit-taking by bulls and the weak New York stock market. Daily trading volume totaled 40 million bushels. The market prices on the 2nd are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December 43.625 Decrease 1.125</p>
<p>May 47.750 Decrease 1.375</p>
<p>July 48.125 Decrease 1.750</p>
<h3>Southern Dried Goods and Lily Buds Show Slight Price Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, activity in the lily bud market has increased slightly. The opening price for spot goods has risen by several qian. Top-grade vegetables are priced at 14 liang, followed by 12 liang 7 qian to 12 liang. Transactions totaled about 200 packages. The prices in Zhenjiang are 11 liang 7 qian to 5 qian for the upper and middle grades. However, current inventories in Shanghai and Zhenjiang are still high, so they have not yet experienced price increases. Nevertheless, market prices are indeed low, so there should not be a large drop in the future market. Yesterday's market price for top-grade vegetables was sold for 14 liang 2 qian, followed by 13 liang to 12 liang 5 qian. Xuzhou vegetables were 11 liang 2 qian, and old inferior vegetables were 7 liang.</p>
<h3>Metal Pure Antimony Reaches New High Price</h3>
<p>Since pure antimony fell back, the market has plummeted. In the past two months, due to the impact of military affairs (bandit suppression) in the producing area (Hunan), arrivals have sharply decreased, causing the Shanghai standard to soar. The highest price reached 250 liang per ton. At present, the export business seems to be developing, so sentiment is even stronger. The standard has reached a new high price and is estimated to be 260 liang per ton. It is said that more than 20 tons were offered yesterday.</p>
<h3>Northern Merchants Actively Purchase British Steel Plates</h3>
<p>丨Spot Goods Are Extremely Scarce丨</p>
<p>British steel plates have been actively sought after by merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and Hankou. Due to the scarcity of spot goods, prices are rising. For example, 2.5 li is estimated at 8 liang 2 qian 5 fen, 5 li at 6 liang 5 qian, 7.5 li at 6 liang 2 qian 5 fen, 1 fen at 6 liang 1 qian 5 fen, and thick colored steel at 6 liang.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Shanghai Cost of Living Index for November of the 21st Year</h3>
<p>The National Tariff Commission recently published the Shanghai Cost of Living Index, stating that the index for November of the 21st year compiled by the commission was 108.7, which is 4.2% lower than the previous month and 13.2% lower than the same month last year. Except for February of this year, when the index showed a high peak due to the Songhu battle, the index has fallen back to around 120 since April. The decline has been particularly significant in the past two months, and this month it has fallen below 110, the lowest record since August of the 18th year. Since the Shanghai Wholesale Price Index compiled by the commission has repeatedly fallen over the years, it is natural that retail prices will also decline accordingly. In terms of major categories, compared to the previous month, food fell by 7.4%, clothing fell by 6.1%, and fuel fell by 4.4%, all of which experienced sharp declines. In terms of individual items, white sugar, green vegetables, and cotton have all suffered severe declines. Other items such as rice, soybeans, coarse cloth, fine cloth, cotton drill, firewood, and coal briquettes have also depreciated, which is the main reason for the decline in the overall index. The index of each category is compared in the table below.</p>

<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3>Blood Head</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>In Shanghai's lower and middle classes, the term "blood head" can often be heard. To explain it, it generally means "empty shell," "pretending to be foreign," putting on airs, or having a good appearance. Without "blood head," one cannot become a fashionable person. Without "blood head," one cannot start a new business. Without "blood head," there is no Shanghai society. Therefore, Shanghai society can be called a "blood head" society.</p>
<p>If a woman doesn't wear a coat and her long dress underneath doesn't show by a foot or so, she's not "blood." If a student's long gown doesn't reveal a section of Western-style trousers, he's not "blood." If you sit in a rickshaw and the front isn't covered with felt, if your hat isn't worn at a rakish angle, if you don't have an Old Gold or Green Tree brand cigarette in your mouth, you're not "blood." What are the signs plastered all over shops saying "sacrificing capital for a big sale"? It's "blood head." What is it when you hire a few cheerleaders upstairs to play "wedding" music? It's also "blood head." There are so many examples of "blood head," it's almost everywhere you look. This is called a "blood head" society.</p>
<p>Opening an exhibition and not inviting a few important Party and government officials as figureheads doesn't count as "blood head." If those few important people don't travel by plane, and aren't touring the mountains in the east and playing in the water in the west, that's also not "blood head." If you don't have airplanes and cannons running rampant everywhere, you can't be called a top-tier "blood head" powerful nation. In the tense state of an international conference, if you don't loudly proclaim withdrawal from the League of Nations and put on an act, that's not "blood head." Therefore, the use of "blood head" is very broad, and its effects are numerous. This is called a "blood head" world. Therefore, when I think of the term "blood head," I think of many "blood head" undertakings. I won't give any more examples now. In short, if a person isn't "blood," they're a wooden dummy and can't stand in society. If a store isn't "blood," it deserves to die and can't exist in the market. If a country isn't "blood," it's out of luck and can't establish itself in the world. "Blood," alas, "blood"! It's truly "blood"! If you meet a few friends who eat from the trough of ideology, they're bound to shout "Long live 'blood head'!" But when I turn my head and think, why be "blood"? What is "blood" good for? I can't answer that question. I need to ask a few "elders."</p>

<h3>Two Quatrains Inspired by Hearing of the National Government's Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>— Wang Fuding</p>
<p>Don't say the royal aura of Jinling has faded away; fixing the tripod in a peaceful place has precedents from past dynasties.</p>
<p>Looking back at arrivals and departures, my heart is greatly grieved; waves beat against the solitary city amidst the night's desolation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the general disregards his own safety; he reverses the sinking of half the country's rivers and mountains.</p>
<p>On the road to Luoyang, Yuanquan advised the emperor to return; he re-entered Jinmen, wiping away the dust in celebration.</p>
<p>Literary Work</p>
<h3>A Letter</h3>
<p>— He Wenxin</p>
<p>He climbed onto the counter to sleep, tears falling naturally onto the pillow. Past events, like a series of movies, played out in his mind:</p>
<p>"How happy I was at school! There were thirty or forty classmates my age. After class, we gathered together to do physical exercises and play hide-and-seek… Everyone was happily laughing like little birds in spring!"</p>
<p>"When I returned home, my mother picked me up, gave me a kiss, and then ran to the kitchen to cook. She was afraid of being late and missing school. She left all the good food for me to eat, willingly enduring hunger herself. No one in the world loved me more deeply than she did! Really, making me an apprentice wasn't her intention. The night before I left her, she said with tears in her eyes, 'Fu, I'm sorry, as your mother! It's not that I don't want you to advance like other children. I also know that being an apprentice is a dead-end job. But middle school costs two or three hundred dollars a year, and university costs five or six hundred dollars a year. Your father could work himself to death and still not earn that much. Rather than failing halfway through, it's better to have a trade of your own, so you can at least earn a living in the future.'"</p>
<p>"From then on, I was taken by a black-awning boat to this place far from home! That is, I fell from a warm stove into an icy snow cave…"</p>
<p>He compared the past and the present, and the more he did, the more unbearable this life became. He got up as if determined to do something. His two small cheeks were flushed with excitement!</p>
<p>From his close-fitting shirt, he pulled out two pieces of paper, an envelope, and a pencil. He gathered all the characters he had learned at the national elementary school, and by the moonlight seeping through the cracks in the shop door, he resolved to write a letter to his mother.</p>
<p>"Mom! Today the boss beat me again, and my colleagues are also bullying me. They are not as lovable as my mom and my classmates. I want to go home, but I don't know the way. Mom! It would be best if you came to take me back!</p>
<p>Your son, Fu"</p>
<p>After he finished writing, he read it aloud and felt very good about it. Then he wrote on the envelope:</p>
<p>"Please give this to my mother."</p>
<p>He folded the letter, put it in the envelope, and felt much calmer. He planned to secretly put it in the mailbox tomorrow when he went to buy cigarettes. He slept very well that night and had many sweet dreams.</p>
<p>(Inspired by reading Anton P. Chekhov's "Vanka." November 28th)</p>
<h3>Continued New Interpretation of Hidden Language</h3>
<p>— Yun Zong</p>
<p>That slippery customer, Lytton, in his "League of Nations Investigating Committee Report," on the settlement of the Manchurian question, does not respect our country's sovereignty in any way, and is almost promoting international co-governance, really is the northern barbarians talking about everyday matters (a bunch of nonsense)!</p>
<p>In this eve of capitalist collapse, the number of unemployed people in various countries is increasing day by day. The unemployed form groups, demonstrating today and petitioning tomorrow. The authorities have no satisfactory way to solve this problem. It is really like riding a horse on the bow of a boat (at a dead end)!</p>
<p>Han Liu Qixin in Shandong, uncles and nephews fighting in Sichuan, causing the people to be frightened and flee, hurrying like a homeless dog, panicking like fish escaping the net, sleeping in the open and eating in the wind, suffering from hunger and cold, truly like a mute eating coptis (an unspeakable bitterness)!</p>
<p>Liang Zuoyou boasted greatly, actually saying that he would donate 30 million to the government. The Executive Yuan initially treated him with the courtesy of a distinguished guest, but later the magic trick was exposed, and it was only then that everyone realized that he was greatly cheated! It is really like a sparrow eating chaff (empty joy)!</p>
<p>Nowadays, our country is suffering from internal and external troubles, which are coming one after another, but the whole country, up and down, is mostly living in a drunken dream. The revival of the Chinese nation, I am afraid, is like a monk marrying a wife (never going to happen)!</p>
<h3>Women in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>"Women in Shanghai!" A writer in a certain magazine said with emotion:</p>
<p>Broad roads, maple trees, a corner of a red building, the harmony of violins and singing; a luxurious car, speeding, huge window decorations, high heels tapping on stone steps, expensive Parisian perfume, handbags, banknotes; cinemas, handsome companions, passionate kisses, the scent of flesh overflowing, children not admitted! Pleasure-seekers selling their souls, women in Shanghai!</p>
<p>But, friends, please show me that you have run out of the ivory tower, taken off your tinted glasses, and stood at the crossroads!</p>
<p>Before dawn, the factory sirens roared wildly. In every nearby shack, many ghosts crawled out from tattered quilts. Each haggard face leaned close to a mirror with a missing corner. They washed their faces with cold water, filled their stomachs with leftover cold rice, prepared enough food for lunch, and hurriedly ran to the factory, fearing that they would be scolded by the foreman for being late, or, even worse, have their wages deducted. The few cents they earn with sweat and blood every day. In the factory, for example, after the wooden spindles are weighed together with the yarn, their careful work ensures that the weight is not reduced when returned. They work tremblingly every day. When they are sick, no one cares! When they die, no one pities them.</p>
<p>And there are:</p>
<p>When the lights are on, Shanghai's sleepless night begins. There are people who absolutely cannot enjoy themselves and sell their bodies to provide pleasure for others. In Shanghai, these women who live in underground tunnels seem to have broken away from the category of "people," and are merely instruments for venting lust, for people to use. White powder and red rouge cover up their original faces, raise their tempting voices, and avoid the ears and eyes of the police, giving insincere smiles to those they seek to exploit. They are not lowly women; they can also enjoy themselves. But they cannot sell their entire souls, so they sell their bodies piecemeal.</p>
<p>The examples are enough. Women in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Broad roads, maple trees, a corner of a red building, the harmony of violins and singing; a luxurious car, speeding, huge window decorations, high heels tapping on stone steps, expensive Parisian perfume, handbags, yarn tickets; cinemas, handsome companions, passionate kisses, the scent of flesh overflowing, children not admitted! Women in Shanghai!</p>
<h3>The Poison of Early Marriage</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>Auntie Liang was a widow, already over fifty years old. She only had one son, named Gengsheng, so she doted on him very much. At the age of fifteen, she got him an apprenticeship at a foreign goods store, and he was highly praised by his teachers and friends!</p>
<p>When Auntie Liang was observing widowhood, she was only in her forties. Now, seeing her son grown up, how happy and joyful her heart was. It was not in vain that she endured ten years of hardship observing her widowhood. Therefore, in her happiness, a tragedy was created, what is commonly called "extreme joy breeds sorrow"!</p>
<p>Because Chinese customs particularly value descendants, especially women, who like to hold their grandchildren and great-grandchildren around their knees, of course Auntie Liang had this mentality. Therefore, she asked relatives to be matchmakers and find a daughter-in-law, hoping to hold a grandson soon and continue the family line. Therefore, Gengsheng was married at the age of sixteen.</p>
<p>When Gengsheng got married, he was still an apprentice, without the ability to support himself. Moreover, he was at the age of development, and the fire of youth was so vigorous! He often returned home on false pretenses to enjoy his paradise of gentleness. On the side of his studies, he was more negligent than usual, fearing the reprimand of his teachers and friends. However, being in this environment, Gengsheng's behavior was no longer what it used to be. He often argued with his teachers and friends, and eventually he was fired. Of course, it is not easy for an apprentice who drops out of school halfway to find another job, so he stayed at home idle.</p>
<p>Since Gengsheng stayed at home idle, he did not think about making a living and relied on his mother for everything. Auntie Liang often ordered Gengsheng to find a job, but how could Gengsheng, who had no skills, do it? As the saying goes, "One who sits and eats will empty a mountain," so after half a year of Gengsheng's sitting and eating, the economy gradually became strained. Therefore, the mother blamed the son, and the wife blamed the husband, and the family had no peaceful day. Gengsheng, having suffered the cold irony and ridicule of his mother and wife, repeatedly became ill with anger. Moreover, Gengsheng had married early, fundamentally depleting his vitality. Water could not nourish fire, and Yin could not nourish Yang, so he was bedridden for three months and eventually passed away to the turbid world. Auntie Liang, who had sought to have descendants as soon as possible, cried so sadly! In her anger, she even blamed her daughter-in-law, saying that she was destined to be a "widow"!</p>
<p>Alas! The above family, because they wanted to have descendants as soon as possible, instead cut off their descendants. There are many such families in China. Therefore, the population of various countries is increasing day by day, while the population of our country is decreasing day by day. For the future of the nation, this is worthy of concern!</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Sympathizers (Continued - Part 3)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Meng Guobao cracked melon seeds, seemingly finding a kind of fragrant and crispy enjoyment in it, quietly chewing away. While everyone was silent, one could hear the rustling sound of Wang Lao'er's wife fanning herself. Under the silvery moonlight, although one couldn't see her appearance clearly, one could still make out her strong but not clumsy figure. She seemed to know that this gentleman from the city was glancing at her, sometimes touching her hair and sometimes tugging at her collar. Meng Guobao finally couldn't help but speak, saying, Lao'er, you've kept this threshing ground very clean! Wang Lao'er said, I share it with Zhao Xiaogouzi; I wouldn't need it all myself! Meng Guobao said, This place of yours is not bad. In this village, you don't have to mix with others. And it's only separated from the big threshing ground over there by a vegetable garden. You can hear people talking over there clearly from here, so it's not lonely. Wang Lao'er said, People who are used to living in the countryside aren't afraid of being cold and isolated. Mr. Meng, you're not used to living in the countryside, are you? The countryside isn't as fun as the city. Meng Guobao smiled and said, Do you like living in the city? Wang Lao'er, hearing this, couldn't help but be filled with envy for the city. Scratching his head, he said, Of course! I often tell her that if I become rich, I'll definitely take her to the provincial capital to see the big pagoda at Yingjiang Temple. Meng Guobao laughed, There are so many fun places in the provincial capital, not just that one pagoda! Now they've built roads along the riverbank. Wang Lao'er said, Really? I heard that roads are different from the streets in Peiping. They're paved with foreign cement and gravel. When it rains, there's no mud on the ground, and when the wind blows, there's no dust. They're as flat as a tabletop. At night, the electric lights along the road are so bright that you could pick up a needle that fell on the ground. Meng Guobao said, Isn't that so? Wang Lao'er's wife couldn't help but interject, asking, I heard that electric lights don't use oil, and no one has to light them. They turn on by themselves when it gets dark and turn off by themselves when it gets light. What's the reason for that? Isn't that a treasure? Meng Guobao wanted to laugh but, upon second thought, realized that laughing would offend her, so he tried his best to hold back. Wang Lao'er said, Do you know? It's a divine thing. The foreign teachers at their school said that the fire inside the electric light is the yin and yang fire collected from the Lightning Goddess. His wife said, Oh! That's incredible! Divine things can be used so casually. Meng Guobao felt that this was an opportunity to speak, so he said, Sister-in-law, how would you know? The ghost stories of the divine era have all become reality now. People used to say that immortals could fly through the sky on clouds and mist, but now we can fly through the sky on clouds and mist as long as we spend a few tens of dollars on an airplane. Wang Lao'er's wife hadn't yet replied when Wang Lao'er interjected, saying, Mr. Meng, why are you so polite, calling her Sister-in-law? Everyone in the village calls her Wang Ersao. You can just call her Wang Ersao. Meng Guobao laughed and said, Lao'er, I have to correct you on that. What's the difference between "Sister-in-law" and "Ersao"? Wang Lao'er said, Oh! I hadn't thought of that. It seems like "Wang Ersao" is her given name. Calling her "Sister-in-law" would be elevating her. Meng Guobao said, Calling her "Sister-in-law" is proper. You're several years older than me. Aren't we like brothers? Hearing this, Wang Lao'er felt genuinely happy from the bottom of his heart and stood up, exclaiming, "Oh!" Then, thinking that people might not see his friendly expression under the moonlight, he sat back down and slapped his thigh, saying, Mr. Meng is truly a good person! Whether Meng Guobao had heard his words or not was unknown because, at that moment, he was thinking that calling a sixteen-year-old bride "Sister-in-law" might make her uncomfortable. However, if this kind of woman hadn't married Wang Lao'er and was still a village girl at home, she would truly be a naturally beautiful wildflower. But it's a pity... As he thought this, he heard the chirping of crickets in the weeds under the bean trellis, and the evening breeze blowing from the water made the leaves and the tall grass on the ground rustle. Just then, a white cloud in the sky covered the moon, and a thin layer of shadow rose from the ground, making the threshing ground quiet down. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Amateur Weekly</p>
<h3>The Mission of This Publication</h3>
<p>After a short period of preparation, "Amateur" is now able to meet with readers as scheduled. We have already stated in our call for submissions: "The purpose of this publication is to supplement industrial and commercial education and improve amateur life." Readers can understand the nature and objectives of this publication from its name, so it may not be necessary to write this routine! mission! text.</p>
<p>However, in today's world where the life of the nation and the economy of society are in danger of perishing and collapsing at any time, how should we awaken the people of the country, and how should we establish a great organizational foundation to cope with the unprecedented transformation in world history that has already begun? How can we revitalize the national spirit that is fading day by day and save the precarious national destiny? The reporter cannot help but have a few humble opinions, which I sincerely offer to readers on the day of this inaugural issue as the ultimate goal of our joint efforts in the future.</p>
<p>We know that shop employees, workers, and apprentices are indeed the backbone of social organization. However, only a minority of these backbones have received a decent education. Looking back at the situation during the year of national crisis, most of them were wandering aimlessly, not knowing what to do. However, whether it is to transform the social environment or to save the nation from danger, it is necessary to have adequate preparation in terms of knowledge in order to shoulder the important task of "connecting the top and bottom". Therefore, the first mission of this publication is to improve the educational level of the backbone of society! shop employees, workers, and apprentices.</p>
<p>We also know that Shanghai is a prosperous place, but it can also be said to be a place of all evils. The singing, dancing, and extravagant life are most likely to erode the ambition of aspiring young people and numb the pure and flawless souls of young people. Therefore, we loudly call for the young people who are responsible for saving the country to not fall into the trap. Therefore, the second mission of this publication is to improve the amateur life of the industrial and commercial circles.</p>
<p>We recall this year's commemoration of "September 18th". The whole city was lifeless. Furthermore, the enthusiasm for resisting inferior goods is declining sharply. All of our employees must at least blame ourselves for not being united and not working hard enough. Therefore, the target of this publication is the entire society, not individuals. We hope that readers will raise research and discussion on various issues such as how to train ourselves, transform our environment, and revive the nation at any time. Therefore, the third mission of this publication is to unite the strength of the masses and jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country.</p>
<p>"Amateur" is small, but the mission is great. We hope to work together to save the dying national destiny!</p>
<p>Problem Discussion</p>
<h3>How to Treat People? Service Issues</h3>
<p>— Pan Yangyao</p>
<p>In general, a person who serves in society deals with three things: things, matters, and people. "Things" are fixed. As long as you are meticulous and careful, and use scientific methods of analysis, you should not be afraid of solving them easily. "Matters" are more difficult because they can be simple, complex, and sometimes have various changes. However, if you can be calm, quick-witted, and use scientific management methods, and have the spirit of patience and hard work, you can also solve them easily. Only the problem of people is the most difficult to deal with and is not easy to please. No matter what level of employee you are, you always feel that dealing with people is the most difficult thing. I don't know how much grievance and how much idleness I have suffered in this process. Everyone has an unspeakable difficulty. Junior employees often feel that senior employees are putting on airs and acting important. Senior employees often feel that junior employees are stubborn, disobedient, and unwilling to work hard. As for colleagues, there are certainly many who are good, but there are not many who get along well. If you don't say that he is hiding laziness, he will say that you are taking shortcuts. If you are respectful to senior employees, you will be said to be flattering. If senior employees talk to him more, you will be said to be favored. It's not right to do this, and it's not right to do that. It's really difficult to be a person. In fact, according to me, as long as people get along in the right way, it is not difficult. Most things in the world are ordinary and can be solved. As long as you eradicate the biggest root cause, you will be happy everywhere. There are three words for the root cause of people getting along:</p>
<p>One is the word "doubt". Nine out of ten misunderstandings come from the word "doubt". One is the word "pride". Nine out of ten conflicts come from the word "pride".</p>
<p>One is the word "anger". Nine out of ten scoldings come from the word "anger".</p>
<p>A person's facial expression is the most difficult to control. Sometimes it is slightly rigid. In the eyes of a suspicious person, he will think that I have some opinions with him. In fact, he is suspicious and annoyed by himself. However, because of this, I have to pay more attention to the expressions on my face. Sometimes, when I am carried away with joy, I can't help but be a little arrogant, and people will think that I am arrogant to him. Sometimes, when I am unhappy, I speak louder and have a stern face, and people will think that I am getting angry. Conversely, putting yourself in their shoes, what about yourself? Yang Jiaoshan, a gentleman of the Ming Dynasty, said: "A person who is willing to think for others when things happen is the best." That's great. Think for others in everything in advance, and it will be easy to treat people. Yesterday, a friend of mine said: "I went to solicit advertisements for the credit agency directory. When I met the manager, he was willing to tell me a few words and sometimes asked me to sit down and give me detailed instructions. Unfortunately, when I met a staff member, he was frowning while working. I was not sensible and asked him a few questions. He either ignored me or said not to bother him, and rudely rejected me. It is really 'easier to see the King of Hell than a minor devil'." He also said: "Sometimes senior employees agree, but junior employees still make things difficult in every way, treating me as if it is very important. It is really 'Bodhisattvas lower their eyebrows and Vajras glare'." After he finished speaking, I said, "You have certainly suffered grievances, but you have not put yourself in other people's shoes. The manager is certainly busy, but there are always people to handle things for him. Each person has a specific responsibility. He is only in charge of commanding and leading, so he can still talk to you. Ordinary employees are writing, calculating, typing, and working very hard. When you go to ask him questions, he will certainly show an unhappy expression. If you speak from the perspective of forgiveness, it is also understandable, so don't get angry." The friend laughed when he heard me say that. Another friend told me: "I worked in a certain company. At first, my monthly salary was twenty yuan, and I was very satisfied. Three months later, the manager suddenly added ten yuan. People congratulated me, but who knew that my pain came from then on? My colleagues gossiped, saying that my salary was high or that I was good at flattering. In fact, I only know how to do my job. I would do it the same way whether I was given a raise or not. Since the raise, whenever there is a difficult task, they all say that this matter requires you. Everything is pushed on me. I am certainly not afraid of doing more things, but how can I bear it if it goes on like this?" After hearing this, I said, "Do you have a family?" He said no. I said, "How is your life?" He said, "I still feel that I have more than enough." I said, "Then, please ask for a pay cut yourself and see what they say." This friend listened to my words and did as I said, and now he is fine. "Less pay, more work" may also be the key to getting along with people. However, I also want to talk about being a senior employee or leader. When I was recuperating in Moganshan, my old friend Qin Hancai sent me a book called "Leadership Studies". At first, I was not willing to read it because I thought that Chinese people have a desire to be leaders. The problem with people is that they like to be leaders, so there is no need to talk about leadership studies anymore. Later, when I read it carefully, every sentence came from experience and every sentence made sense. It can be seen that it is really not easy to be a person above others. Because it is not easy to do, so you have to study it. I feel that the most pertinent words in the book are that the value of a leader lies in being able to "tolerate others", being able to "harmonize colleagues", being able to "guide employees", being able to "recognize talents", and being able to "take the strengths of others and make up for one's own weaknesses". I remember that Mr. Huang Renzhi once said to the leader of a certain factory: "You should calculate accurately and check thoroughly on matters and things, but you should not do so on people. You must be honest, generous, and tolerant. Then everyone will be happy to be used by me. This is the general attitude that is necessary for dealing with people in the world." If those who are in a position above others keep these golden words in mind, then people will be at ease and wholeheartedly be used by you. They will not complain even if they are tired or refuse even if they are bitter. The difficulty of dealing with people will not be a problem.</p>

<h3>The "Four Heads" Life of an Office Worker</h3>
<p>— Hui Zun</p>
<p>It seemed as if yesterday's fatigue had not fully recovered when the alarm clock on the bedside rang at 7:30. I was suddenly awakened from my dream by it, and I felt that the time of the night had passed too quickly. I was too lazy to get up, but driven by life, I had to break away from the warm blanket, and my body felt a little cold.</p>
<p>After getting up, I went through the daily routine of bowel movements, gargling, washing my face, eating breakfast, etc., and it was already 8:15. That's terrible! I hurriedly grabbed a newspaper and hurriedly left the gate, squeezing into the third-class carriage of a tram. Because I was walking too fast, I was constantly panting.</p>
<p>At this time, it is the so-called Officehour in Shanghai. The time for buses to collect money is called "busy time". This time is really busy. Look, the third-class carriages, the trailers, and even the first-class trams and buses are full of crowds heading towards the Bund.</p>
<p>The car stopped for a while at a turning point, and my old friend Zhang also squeezed up from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang! How are you?" I sent my voice over from the shoulder of a person.</p>
<p>"Ah! Are you here too? ... What's good or bad? Still living the 'Four Heads' life." Zhang replied and squeezed in front of me.</p>
<p>"What! 'Four Heads' life! What..."</p>
<p>"Aren't you also a junior office worker in a company?" He said: "How can you not understand this 'Four Heads' life? Haha! Let me tell you!" So he started talking.</p>
<p>"Doesn't your company open at nine o'clock? Don't you have to rush there at 8:15? Aren't you squeezing in here because you're afraid of being late? Of course, you have to get to the office before nine o'clock no matter what. But if you are a manager, a supervisor, or some senior employee, then you can go slowly. It doesn't matter if you go at eleven o'clock. So, junior office workers have to arrive 'ahead' of others. This is the first 'head'."</p>
<p>"Um..."</p>
<p>"Even if you are exhausted, you can't leave until the bell rings at five o'clock in the afternoon. Sometimes, you even have to wait until 5:30 or 6:00 to have hope of getting out of the gate. However, managers, supervisors, and other senior employees disappear at three o'clock. This is called leaving 'behind' others. This is the second 'head'."</p>
<p>"On the day of paying salaries, the salary envelopes of senior employees are thick with colorful piles of banknotes, while ours are only a few thin sheets, at most, only other peoples' 'change,' this is the third 'head'. If things are done slightly less than perfect, the iron faces of senior employees will sink, and they will scold you a few times! Ouch! This is the fourth 'head'."</p>
<p>"Coming ahead, leaving behind, taking the change, eating the scolding, isn't this the 'Four Heads' life? Haha! Brother! You and I are living the same 'Four Heads' life!" Zhang shouted loudly.</p>
<p>The car happened to reach its destination, so I said goodbye to Zhang and squeezed out of the car. I rushed to the office. Ah! I'm the first one.</p>
<p>"Ah! 'Four Heads' life!" I tasted it wistfully like this.</p>

<h3>The Boredom of an Apprentice Dear Editor:</h3>
<p>I am a child who has not received sufficient education and also a child who is interested in literature and all sciences. However, the charm of economics is oppressing me, preventing me from developing my interests. And in the year before last, I stepped into a dark society and began to live a life far away from the light. How disappointing and painful this is!</p>

<h3>What is Scientific Management?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>We often hear people say that someone is very shrewd and "scientific" in their work; or that a certain organization performs well and is "scientific." But what exactly does "scientific" mean? "Scientific" means being planned, organized, working efficiently, and conforming to scientific principles. The 20th century is an era of science. Whatever we do, we should base it on scientific methods to achieve perfection. Haphazard and fatalistic approaches are completely unacceptable. Therefore, "scientific management" has been promoted by Frederick Winslow Taylor of the United States in recent decades, and subsequently adopted by the industrial circles of Britain and Germany. After the European War, Germany's Walther Rathenau, based on this method, initiated what is called "industrial rationalization," which revived the declining German industry, attracting worldwide attention. In 1927, the League of Nations held an international economic conference in Geneva and decided to adopt "industrial rationalization." As a result, "scientific management" was not only adopted by European and American countries, but also by Soviet Russia in its Five-Year Plan. At the National Industry and Commerce Conference in our country, the proposal to implement rationalization and scientific management was also included in the general assembly declaration. Mr. Wang Yunwu of the Commercial Press and Mr. Xiang Kangyuan of Kangyuan Printing and Canning Factory have also made great efforts to promote it, and their experimental results have been very good. However, what exactly is "scientific management"? "Scientific management" is not just about using scientific methods to improve management and equipment, or time and motion studies... This is just a means of "scientific management." Its true essence lies in the psychological reform of both labor and management, each recognizing their responsibility to the other, and jointly seeking the development of industry.</p>
<p>However, scientific management also has three meanings: ㈠ narrowly defined, limited to factories; ㈡ broadly defined, extending this method to all industries and businesses, not limited to factories; ㈢ most broadly defined, not limited to one factory or one company, but encompassing the entire industry or the national economy, under which definition it is also called "industrial rationalization."</p>
<p>The commonly adopted "scientific management" can be roughly divided into twelve points. Due to limited space, I cannot discuss them in detail here, but only list them in outline form as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Time study | Measuring the daily production capacity of employees.</p>
<p>(2) Motion study | Studying the basic movements of work to make them the easiest and fastest.</p>
<p>(3) Setting work standards | Certain employees should achieve certain results each day.</p>
<p>(4) Memory aids | Eliminating confusion and errors.</p>
<p>(5) Planning work sequences | Connecting work processes and saving costs.</p>
<p>(6) Conserving energy | Saving energy for more work.</p>
<p>(7) Standardization | Specifying product styles | Saving equipment, raw materials, and procedures.</p>
<p>(8) Simplification | Specifying product types | Saving equipment, raw materials, and procedures.</p>
<p>(9) Analyzing work | Personnel and remuneration (rationalizing wages) are appropriately allocated.</p>
<p>(10) Requesting equipment | Saving energy, eliminating costs, and connecting various tasks.</p>
<p>(11) Strict organization | Defining responsibilities and expediting administration.</p>
<p>(12) Adopting cost accounting | Accurate budgeting to facilitate the setting of work standards.</p>
<p>(13) Preparing budgets | Systematizing finances and standardizing receipts and disbursements.</p>
<p>(14) Conducting statistics | Comparing the gains and losses of business and providing a basis for operations.</p>
<p>If we can plan thoroughly and implement scientific management well, not only can work efficiency be increased, but the entire industry and the entire society will also have solutions. This is even more significant in China, because if we can produce enough for our own needs after increasing production, that would be remarkable. As for the epidemics of "overproduction" and "worker unemployment," we are not afraid of them. The results of implementing "scientific management" are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Improved labor-management relations | Sincere cooperation.</p>
<p>(2) Elimination of waste | Reduced costs | Low prices.</p>
<p>(3) Product improvement | Improved quality | High quality.</p>
<p>(4) Increased production | Generous shareholder dividends | Industrial development.</p>
<p>(5) Increased wages | Guaranteeing workers' livelihoods | Social stability.</p>
<p>Our country's industries are declining, production is lagging behind, and there are no large-scale factories, so there is no talk of international trade (except for a few local products). From an international perspective, we only have small-scale enterprises. Therefore, some people say: "Scientific management" is only suitable for large-scale industries. For our small factories and shops, is it "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut"? There is no need for this "fashionable foreign product" of scientific management, and we don't need to study or adopt it. Therefore, "scientific management," which has been proven effective in European and American countries, is still rarely adopted by us, which is a very regrettable thing. If we want to revitalize industry in the future, achieve low prices and high quality, and recover our rights and interests to save the country, we must fundamentally change our attitude. I hope that industrialists with aspirations in the country will use a research attitude and a scientific spirit to experiment with "scientific management" step by step.</p>
<p>However, when we implement this method, there is one point that should be particularly noted: that is, "the scientific spirit should pay attention to facts." Ordinary people often misunderstand "scientific management," thinking that implementing "scientific management" means focusing solely on "mechanical" methods and ignoring matters within the scope of "personnel." Without considering the internal situation, they force it into use, which often does not work. Even in European and American countries, this situation occurred frequently during the experimental period. The reason why this method is doubted is because it is not adopted properly. We should learn from this and not repeat the same mistakes. When implementing it, we should follow the following steps:</p>
<p>(1) Research | Methods and environment.</p>
<p>(2) Education | Promotion and understanding.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to the welfare of employees.</p>
<p>(4) Obtain the sympathy and cooperation of employees.</p>
<p>(5) Gradual progress.</p>
<p>(6) Perseverance to the end and implementation step by step.</p>
<p>In this way, we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and succeed smoothly.</p>
<p>The publication of your esteemed journal makes me feel that there may be a glimmer of hope in the gray future, because the content of your journal is all about guidance for our junior staff in their service, and it can be said to be a compass for our current struggles.</p>
<p>Now I have a few questions that I have written down below, hoping to get a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>(1) After a child enters the "door of career," what methods can be used to seek further progress in learning?</p>
<p>(2) Why should a junior staff member be ridiculed and despised by colleagues and even tea servers?</p>
<p>(3) How can one achieve the "bright path" in one's career?</p>
<p>(4) The steps for a career person to study science | The steps for a career person who is only interested in science but has no knowledge and is economically disadvantaged to study science.</p>
<p>(5) How can one fulfill the obligations of a member of the Republic of China and engage in the work of resisting Japan and saving the country?</p>
<p>Zhou Liangji</p>
<p>Editor's note: We believe that the five questions raised by Mr. Zhou Liangji are common problems felt by apprentices in the business community today and are of great value for public discussion. We will now answer the first four questions raised by Mr. Zhou as follows:</p>
<p>(1) After a young person enters the "door of career," there are two ways to seek further progress in learning:</p>
<p>(A) Be loyal to your job. Seeking progress in your job is seeking progress in learning. The most relevant learning is to fulfill your duties. Watt was only an assistant repairing instruments, but because he was unwilling to be perfunctory about the water pump that a professor gave him to repair, he eventually invented the steam engine, which changed the world. Don't underestimate your small tasks; small tasks are the starting point for great achievements. Human creation is just making a big deal out of a small matter.</p>
<p>(B) Time is life. Use your spare time from your job to pursue the learning you like to pursue. As long as you persevere, you will surely achieve great things. For example, if you are interested in science, you should mobilize all your spare time to attack science, without letting a trace of it go to gambling venues or dance halls. A person must play, and you can play scientific tricks. If you play properly, I guarantee it will be more interesting than playing cards, and you can play out first-class learning.</p>
<p>(2) Why should a junior staff member be ridiculed and despised by colleagues and even tea servers? This is because of the poison of traditional concepts. I have suggested to several gentlemen that newspapers should be run as places of learning (not traditional schools but revolutionary schools). People who serve should be treated equally, without any distinction between big and small. People like tea servers and drivers originally had excessive snobbish ideas; bullying the poor and valuing the rich, flattering the big and insulting the small, are habits they acquired in an unfortunate environment. Only revolutionary education can change them. But we individuals must also put in the effort to reflect on ourselves. Those who are willing to take a loss will never take a loss in the end. Gentle people are blessed. If you treat everyone with the attitude of an educator and a student, you probably won't make any big mistakes, right? The attitude of an educator is to recognize that people are teachable and capable of doing good, not to be fond of being a teacher. If you are fond of being a teacher, people will not accept it.</p>
<p>(3) There are two "bright paths" in one's career: one is equal opportunity for all professions, and this path requires education and social transformation to attack from both sides in order to break through; the other is creation and invention, and on this path, natural science is the only sun, now covered by the dark clouds of superstition, fantasy, recklessness, and nonsense. We must invite our brains and hands to clear away the dark clouds so that we can see the light of day again.</p>
<p>(4) The steps for a career person to study science are: first, to personally play scientific tricks; second, to personally observe natural phenomena and various man-made civilizations and pursue their reasons; third, to read science books that guide experiments, not foreign stereotypes and foreign policy essays; fourth, to ask about everything and get to the bottom of it; and fifth, to continue to work hard until old age. True learning comes from "doing." The ancients had a saying, "Without learning, there is no skill." My opinion is: "Without doing, there is no learning; without doing, there is no skill." What do you think?</p>
<p>I wish you effort Editor's reply</p>
<p>Finally, we have two points to ask readers to pay attention to:</p>
<p>(1) The above answers are only the results of discussions between a few of us and our friends and cannot be considered satisfactory answers. We still welcome readers to join the discussion in order to gather ideas and benefit from them.</p>
<p>(2) We have not answered the fifth question raised by Mr. Zhou because we feel that this question must be determined based on various objective conditions and it is difficult to give an answer casually. Therefore, we have decided to put forward this question and first ask readers to express their opinions and discuss it to a certain</p>

<h3>Happiness in Fulfilling Responsibilities</h3>
<p>— Gongping</p>
<p>The great Greek philosopher Aristotle once gave a definition of mankind, calling it: "Man is a rational animal." Since ancient times, China has also had the concept that "a man without propriety, what difference is there from beasts?" Indeed, the reason why mankind can boast of being the spirit of all things is of course because mankind is rational and knows righteousness. However, human intelligence is constantly developing forward, and in the 20th century, we have realized that what distinguishes mankind from beasts, in addition to the most precious rationality, is also a more significant feature! What is this greater feature? It is the "labor" that we are most familiar with.</p>
<p>The "labor" mentioned here is broadly defined, encompassing all areas of human activity. Beasts have nothing to do but eat and drink when hungry and thirsty. But humans have purposeful, continuous labor to prepare for a rainy day. To know the greatness and importance of labor, we only need to observe the things we humans need at any time and place, and there is no one that does not involve our labor. Anything! Whether it is clothing, food, utensils, or works of art and literature丨the more exquisite and superb, the more difficult and time-consuming its creation must be, that is, it requires more labor. Therefore, to examine the level of culture of a country and its people, we only need to look at the development of its industry, commerce, literature, and art. Europe, America, and our enemy Japan have more developed industry, commerce, literature, and art than China, so their cultural levels are higher than China. From this, we can know how precious "labor" is to us humans. Therefore, if we want our motherland to be able to compete with Europe, America, and Japan, we can only devote ourselves to our respective careers, work hard, improve day by day, and strive for perfection in order to achieve our goal!</p>
<p>Humans must labor, and only labor, can they survive indefinitely. If you don't work, you die. If an individual doesn't work, the individual dies. If a nation doesn't work, that nation will surely perish. Those who enjoy ready-made things without working are the traitors of mankind. We don't have to envy them. We should boast to them with the sweat we shed. Because labor is a responsibility that everyone must fulfill!</p>
<p>Since labor is a responsibility that everyone should fulfill, then why do we often hear people who are working complaining about life and hating labor? When we examine their living conditions, they are indeed very difficult and pitiable. On the other hand, the more people who enjoy ready-made things without working, the more fulfilling their lives are. This is because of the current bad social system. We believe that the labor of masons and carpenters, in terms of value, is equal to that of engineers sitting in design offices. The police are of course serving the people, but the cleaners who empty the toilets are also fulfilling their responsibilities in the same way. Then, what should we do about our current situation? Be disappointed? Curse? Be passive? Naturally, none of these are useful. I think we only have to work harder to find a way out.</p>
<p>We understand that paradise is not on Mount Alps, and paradise is not in the West. Heaven and paradise exist only in our hard work. We should only use our spare time to cultivate and increase our abilities. With ability, any stubborn and unreasonable system can be broken through. We can only find happiness from the creation of our own more fulfilling career, and only this kind of happiness is true happiness! Even if we are suffering and despised by the general public now, our hard work will one day be valued丨</p>
<p>Paragraph, and then we will synthesize opinions to make a considerable conclusion. Now I will write this question again below:</p>
<p>"Standing in the position of a clerk, worker, or apprentice, how can one fulfill the obligations of a member of the Republic of China and engage in the work of resisting Japan and saving the country?" Editor's note</p>
