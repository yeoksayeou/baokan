<h3 id="c1">國難會議之難產彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>國難會議前以粤方中委之倡議。繼以四届一中全會之决議。及國府之陸續多次聘請會員。久已甚囂塵上今會議且已决定於本月七日正式舉行矣。吾人於此一會議。嚮即不加重視。一月二十八日曾已爲評提出種種疑問就使會而能集集。而能議而謂其遂足以打破當前之國難。蓋亦等於痴人説夢。今請於會期迫近即將正式舉行之前。再予以嚴正之批判。</p>
<p>國難會議。旨在救國。在接納人民之公意。以定救國之根本方針。然而禦侮救災。早已爲全國人民一致之呼聲矣。澄淸政治。建設民主政治。以及種種應興應革之大政。全國人民亦早已一致明白要求矣。政府而眞誠意悔禍誠意接納人民之公意。則即應本此「民意。」與人民努力以共趨。更何必費多時之躊躇。舉行一不必有之會議。退一步言。即斯會而眞有舉行之必要。然而會員而以選聘聘。請之人。則又皆爲寛衣博袖西裝革履之所謂「名流」「聞人」或「領袖」「學者。」一次聘請之不足。繼之以再。繼之以三四。畢羅盡舉。舉凡曩日之所視爲軍閥官僚政客反動派爲無可容恕者今皆鉅細不遺。獨於佔全國人口最大多數。而又實際處於身受最大痛苦悲境之農工羣衆。竟未見徵聘一人。是則斯會而即眞能召集。亦不過爲「聞人」「名流」之會議耳。不過爲「聞人」「名流」之「公意」耳。</p>
<p>再退一步言。即會議之結果而誠足以代表人民之公意誠足以打破當前之艱難。拯救我民族於危亡。然而斯會之性質。旣非立法機關。復無拘束政府之權力。如一月間報載某中委談。「國難會不過爲討論出辦法來。供中央之參考。」則已明示决議之不必實行矣。設辦法議出。而「中央參考」之下。認爲不必採行。而長擱置於案頭。則斯會之集。不仍將徒爲兒戲毫無意義耶。</p>
<p>最近汪院長明白規定國難會議所討論之範圍爲救災禦侮綏靖。逾此即非所許。則斯會之集。徒以敷衍人民。更爲明顯。以言救災。自去年洪水驟發。政府雖亦曾有救濟水災委員會之組織。但除借美麥而外。所藉以杯水救車薪者。仍爲我人民一再捐輸之累積。所謂賑災公債三千萬。用於何處。吾人迄今未見政府之明告以言禦侮自九一八禍變突發。我人民即無日不敦促政府長期抵抗。收復失地。馬占山所部之苦戰龍江。與此次十九路軍之英勇抗暴。我人民之踴躍捐輸。熱烈愛護。助財助力。亦爲共見之事實。而政府則亘半年之久。對内高呼鎭靜。對外乞憐告哀。戰和不决。土不能守國。不能衛。則所謂「禦侮」一問題之討論。不又爲近於欺騙耶。再如綏靖。吾人認爲匪盜之作。都由於政治之黑暗。人民生計窮蹙。自不得不挺而走險。嚮使政治而長此黑暗。人民長困水火。則苛政之下。誰爲善良。誰爲匪盜。將從何而辨白。民不畏死。法將安施。年來政府籌巨欵。調大兵。剿匪之結果如何。則所謂綏靖問題之討論。彼手無寸鐵之「名流」「聞人。」又不過貢獻政府若干紙上談兵之辦法而已。</p>
<p>如止所陳。則國難會議之價値與其意義。吾人應已瞭然。一言以蔽之。不過爲敷衍人民之一種手段耳。吾人是否應重視斯會。被徵聘之諸君子是否甘爲傀儡。曷其三思。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>停戰撤兵會議，連日開會已達十次之多，因日方毫無誠意，致無結果，昨日會議，討論撤兵時期問題，我方主張，倘日方不將撤兵日期確定，决不簽字，但是會議結果，仍是一個稍有進展，難關未破，</p>
<p>此次撤兵會議，我本來認爲毫無意義，有些意義的就是撤兵的時期問題，總之欲開會議，須待日兵撤盡，日兵不撤盡，任何會議，總不能開，即開亦必無結果，倘日本確定撤兵時期，即撤退地點問題，亦可不加討論，蓋暫時的駐紥，絕不發生任何關係也，</p>
<p>今日方一面會議撤兵，一面在太倉方面，積極進攻，昨據報紙消息，連日停戰館議，正在商議撤兵問題，不料日軍在太倉方面，於昨晨乘我方未加防禦之際，進佔太倉，城内居民，逃避一空，是明明欲以砲艦政策，威懾我國，我國雖懦，城下之盟，寗甘接受，并且國聯决議案有曰，</p>
<p>（一）國聯不承認或容許中國領土完整與政治主權</p>
<p>（一）鄭重申明在武力及其他脅迫下解决目前爭執爲不合法</p>
<p>故此次撤兵會議我認爲根本上决無良好效果，并且從此次開會情形觀之，彼方出席會議，或畫畫小像，或打打鼾睡，完全表現其傲慢無禮游戲神通的國民性，如此會議，而有良好之結果，我不信也，</p>
<p>前日我聞某日人言，「中國須要原諒，此次日本在滬作戰，損失人馬金錢，不知凡幾，試問我們拿些什麽回去交代政府，」我可以答曰，「此次十九路軍在滬抵抗，人馬損失幾許，閘北江灣等處，人民之生命財產房屋，不知損失幾許，試問我們拿些什麽來交代人民，」</p>
<p>并且此次戰事，釁自彼開，受些小小損失，亦是咎由自取，我國人民何辜，何咎於日人，而遭此重大之蹂躪，試問當向什麽人去算帳，</p>

<p>— 陳級梅</p>
<p>二十一年一月最後的一個淸晨，死灰的雲幕蓋着這繁榮的滬濱，燒夷彈與重砲奏着交響的天籟，血肉與鐵片飛迸着中華的英魂。銀灰色的鐵鳥帶了戰魔的使命，爬着的鐵老虎呑噬了和平之神，幾許建築物免不了鐵蹄的蹂躪，勾魂使者顯示了最恐怖的狰獰。曾經熱閙的街現在是這麽冷靜，似是太戈璧沙漠又似是　都城，一縷縷白烟還從瓦礫中向上噴，七八個死難者的臉上顯着悲憤。微風裏聽見一陣恐怖的哀號聲，拚命地奔逃着一個中華小國民，後面追逐着幾個敵國裏的野獸，前面撞出四個侵我土地的敵人。八九歲的小小生命有甚麽本領？戰慄與哀號打不動倭奴的同情。六個野獸緊緊地將他困在垓心，一個睜着虎眼前進要搜他的身。小小的弱者并没有帶着危險品，只有一把小洋刀是這麽的精新，可是這掩不了倭奴殘忍的獸性，公理與人道早被强權进入荒墳。小洋刀深深地刺進小弱者的心，慘痛的哀號後只有微弱的呻吟，鮮紅的熱血像噴泉般突突飛迸，春申江畔又添一個可憐的幽魂。</p>

<h3 id="c127">鐵 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 徵</p>
<p>鐵的藴藏非常豐富，價値很低廉，牠的性質又優良，所以用途是極廣大，現在我請牠出來，介紹給諸位：據孟脱李斯氏（Ｍｏｎｔｅｔｉｕｓ）著的鐵器時代起始一書上面説，中國確是首先用鐵。崔豹古今注説：「黃帝與蚩尤戰於涿鹿之野蚩尤作大霧，士兵皆迷途，於是作指南車以示四方，遂擒蚩尤」造指南車必定是用磁針，製磁針則必須用鐵，可知我國在黃帝時已用鐵；推算其時，大約在西曆紀元前二七○○年；孟氏書上説埃及用鐵在紀元前一二○○年，爲西國最早用鐵了。倘若算起來，我中國用鐵，比他們早一五○○年。但是現在看看人家用鐵怎樣？自己怎樣？我們子孫不肖，祗有快些張氣。</p>
<p>講到鐵是化學元素中的一種，屬於金屬類的，符號是Ｆｅ，看上去是灰白色的。牠有極好的延長性；鐵絲的强靸及耐牽引性，在金屬中讓還牠最好了。我們要燒融牠，倒是非常吃力，因爲牠的融點是極高。牠的感磁性是很好的；所以鐵的東西，可以給磁石（俗名吸鐵石）吸引的。鐵的性質，要看牠所混含碳的量多少而分爲；熟鐵（WioughtLron），鋼（Sterl），生鐵（Cast　Lron）三種。</p>
<p>熟鐵是含量Ｏ·Ｓ％以下的鐵，牠性質與純鐵（Ｐｕｒｅ　Ｌｒｏｎ）相同。旣强韌，又富有延長性；拿牠放在火中燒紅，就能軟化，打成各種形狀極容易。牠還能夠感磁，但不易保存，做暫時電磁鐵就用牠的。</p>
<p>鋼是含碳量在１％左右的鐵，紅熱之，亦能軟化，同熟鐵一樣。融點較純鐵低，故鑄各種器具亦比較純鐵容易些。燒紅的鋼，急侵牠在冷水中，能夠增加牠的硬度。鋼非常容易感磁，又有保存的性；製各種永久磁石都用鋼的。</p>
<p>生鐵是含碳量在４％左右的鐵，融點在三種中算牠最低了；從鐵鑛中最初鍊得的鐵，就是生鐵；鍊出時急冷牠，則是含有鐵與碳的化合物，顏色白的，所以呌牠爲白生鐵（Ｗｈｉｔｅ　Ｃａｓｔ　Ｌｒｏｎ倘鍊出後，待牠漸漸冷却的，則牠會析出石墨（Ｇｒａｐｈｉｔｅ），（亦是一種碳質），變成灰色，呌灰生鐵（Ｇｒａｙ　Ｃａｓｔ　Ｌｒｏｎ）倘若鋼混合８％的錳，或１％的鉻，則牠的硬度更則利害。熟鐵含有３％的鎳，則變成强韌而有彈性。但是含有硫黃或磷的鐵，則脆弱而不適實用了。</p>
<p>鐵能夠同養氣化合，平常鐵器擱置得日子多了，便生一層黃的鐵銹；這就是因爲鐵與空氣中的養氣接觸，化合成一重氣化鐵。鐵還能與硫，氯等化合，成别種物質。</p>
<p>鐵因爲（一）强韌；（二）燒紅之能軟化；（三）從燒熱冷却的變化，能得到任意的硬度與彈性；（四）出產多而價廉，所以機械工業上都用牠。鋼可以製造鋒利的武器，綿延的鐵軌，航海巨艦，强硬的甲板，高立的橋樑，精密的機械，同其他一切建築的材料。生鐵製造鐵管，鐵柱，與各種器具。熟鐵因爲有一時的感磁性，我在上面略爲説過，可以做一種暫時的電磁鐵；電鈴，電報的機内都用着；有一種電磁起重機内的磁鐵，亦拿熟鐵做的。但是，純鐵的用途反而不靈，不過精製成的鐵粉，給貧血症的藥中用。</p>

<p>— 來澄源</p>
<p>奇怪得很，「春多幻夢的一句話，我現在已經實地嘗試了，我呢，本來是不大會做夢的·就是有不過最少數的少數罷了，可是到了今年的春天，夢的幻境，很自然地開拓和澎漲起來了，在沉沉睡着在黑甜鄉裏的我，一切的一切，夢裏眞眞維妙維肖，整個的流連了我，像那劉後主的樂不思蜀的情趣了·</p>
<p>還記得昨天的晚上，看了因時局關係的報的號外，腦印中驟然的感覺到帝國主義的顢頇和橫行同！時就連索的想到我中華人民的體格的不健全，自然是體育不普及的根本的病因啊！</p>
<p>「日有所思，」「夜有所夢，」於一刹那的過程中，我的奮發的心靈達到了沸點的當兒，我的兩條腿呢，彷彿生了飛毛一般，向目的地的Ｓ城，邁開着我的大步，如瘋般的狂奔着·不知不覺的開始了我和無數健兒的萬米長途賽跑了·沿途的觀衆，排山倒海般的站立着，他們的心目中好像充滿着羨慕着我們的剛毅與果敢，行行重行行Ｓ城在望了，於揚巾歡呼聲裏，遽然信手拈來，給我得着了冠軍的錦標·得意忘形的我，總算揚眉吐氣了·</p>
<p>無情的閙鐘，鈴鈴的聲調，終於喊回了他的主人翁的五分鐘的黃梁大夢·靜悄悄的一張四不平八不穩的無錫牀上，蓋着破碎而黃灰色的被絮，仍是睡着一個目無瞳神面帶菜色的一個東亞病夫，不久的過去的幻境，空洞洞的轉眼已成浮烟了，病夫般的我，還是一個骨瘦如柴的病夫罷！</p>
<p>但是話又説回來了，我的一個夢，不過是比較渺小又渺小的一頁罷了，誰都曉得侵略家的日常所思的是武力萬能，他所夢的亦必定是如何運用武力的，資本家的日常所思的是金錢萬能他所夢的亦必定是如何運用金錢的·其他，徵逐如浪蝶般的靑年，不用説就是高唐夢了，貪婪如蒼蠅般的官吏，自然多是邯鄲夢了，那末，夢的眞相，夢的線索，可以説；是慾望與環境中得來的了·亦可以説；足以代表世間的一切了·</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Difficult Birth of the National Crisis Conference <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The National Crisis Conference was initially proposed by the Guangdong faction's Central Committee members, followed by a resolution from the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee, and then by the National Government's successive invitations to members. The clamor surrounding it has been quite loud for some time, and now the conference is scheduled to officially begin on the 7th of this month. We have never placed much importance on this conference. On January 28th, we already published a commentary raising various questions. Even if the conference convenes and manages to reach a consensus, to think it will be sufficient to overcome the current national crisis is tantamount to a fool's dream. Now, as the conference date approaches and it is about to officially begin, we will offer another stern critique.</p>
<p>The purpose of the National Crisis Conference is to save the nation by accepting the public opinion of the people and determining a fundamental strategy for national salvation. However, resisting aggression and relieving disaster have long been the unanimous call of the people. Clarifying politics, building a democratic government, and various other major policies that should be promoted and reformed have also long been the unanimous and clear demands of the people. If the government sincerely intends to repent and genuinely accept the public opinion of the people, it should base its actions on this "popular will" and work with the people to achieve it together. Why bother to hesitate for so long and hold an unnecessary conference? Even assuming this conference is truly necessary, the members are selected and invited. Those invited are all so-called "celebrities," "famous figures," or "leaders" and "scholars" who wear loose robes and Western suits. One round of invitations is not enough, so it is followed by a second, then a third and fourth, including everyone exhaustively. Those who were previously regarded as warlords, bureaucrats, politicians, and reactionaries and considered unforgivable are now included without omission, regardless of their importance. However, the vast majority of the national population, who are actually suffering the greatest pain and misery – the peasants and workers – not a single one has been invited. Therefore, even if this conference can truly convene, it will only be a conference of "famous figures" and "celebrities." It will only represent the "public opinion" of "famous figures" and "celebrities."</p>
<p>Taking it a step further, even if the outcome of the conference can genuinely represent the public opinion of the people and truly overcome the current difficulties, saving our nation from danger and destruction, the nature of this conference is neither a legislative body nor does it have the power to bind the government. As reported in the newspapers in January, a certain Central Committee member stated, "The National Crisis Conference is merely to discuss solutions for the central government's reference," which clearly indicates that the resolutions do not necessarily need to be implemented. If solutions are discussed but, under the guise of "central government reference," it is deemed unnecessary to adopt them and they are shelved indefinitely, will the convening of this conference not be in vain, a meaningless farce?</p>
<p>Recently, Premier Wang clearly stipulated that the scope of discussion for the National Crisis Conference is limited to disaster relief, resisting aggression, and pacification, and anything beyond this is not permitted. This makes it even clearer that the convening of this conference is merely to appease the people. Regarding disaster relief, since the sudden floods last year, the government has established a Relief of Water Disaster Committee, but other than borrowing American wheat, what has been used to provide a mere drop in the bucket is still the accumulated donations from our people. Where has the so-called 30 million yuan in disaster relief bonds gone? We have yet to see a clear announcement from the government. Regarding resisting aggression, since the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident, our people have been urging the government to engage in long-term resistance and recover lost territory. Ma Zhanshan's troops fought bitterly in Longjiang, and the heroic resistance of the 19th Route Army this time, along with the enthusiastic donations and fervent support of our people, providing both financial and material assistance, are all well-known facts. However, for half a year, the government has been calling for calm internally and begging and lamenting externally. Unable to decide between war and peace, unable to defend territory and protect the nation, is the discussion of the so-called "resisting aggression" problem not close to deception? Furthermore, as for pacification, we believe that the actions of bandits are due to the darkness of politics and the poverty of the people's livelihoods. They have no choice but to take risks. If politics remains dark and the people remain trapped in suffering, under oppressive rule, who is good and who is a bandit? How can one distinguish between them? When the people do not fear death, what law can be enforced? In recent years, what has been the result of the government raising huge sums of money and dispatching large armies to suppress bandits? Therefore, the discussion of the pacification problem will merely lead to the "famous figures" and "celebrities" who have no weapons contributing some armchair strategies to the government.</p>
<p>Based on what has been stated, the value and meaning of the National Crisis Conference should already be clear to us. In a nutshell, it is merely a means of appeasing the people. Should we value this conference? Are the gentlemen who have been invited willing to be puppets? They should think carefully about this.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Last Key of the Ceasefire Conference <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Issue of the Deadline for Japanese Troop Withdrawal: Both Sides Insist, the Situation is Tense; Tomorrow Morning's General Assembly Will Determine Success or Failure. The ceasefire conference has now entered its final key stage. At the ninth general assembly yesterday morning, the second article of the draft agreement was formally passed. However, the issue of the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops remains very difficult to resolve. The Military Subcommittee continued to discuss the issue of the location of Japanese troops yesterday morning and has drafted a plan. What was previously considered the most difficult issue to resolve seems to have eased. The focus of the conference has now shifted to the issue of the withdrawal deadline. Both the general assembly and the subcommittee are adjourned today. The general assembly is scheduled to reconvene at 10:00 tomorrow morning and will make a final discussion. Therefore, tomorrow morning's general assembly is truly the crucial moment for the success or failure of the entire situation.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Conference Communique <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The ninth general assembly of the ceasefire conference yesterday afternoon issued a communique stating that the ceasefire conference continued from morning to afternoon today. The results of the discussion were quite progressive and have gradually reached the main issues. The general assembly is now adjourned until Saturday morning so that the Military Subcommittee has ample time to continue discussing everything. The Military Subcommittee's communique yesterday afternoon stated that the Military Subcommittee's meeting this morning made good progress. The fundamental issue of troop withdrawal has been tentatively agreed upon. The meeting is now adjourned so that the unresolved points can be presented to the chief representatives of both sides for consideration. Future meetings of the Military Subcommittee will be determined by the instructions of the chief representatives of both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Yesterday's Results <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The ninth ceasefire conference began at 10:00 yesterday morning and adjourned at 12:30. Present were our chief representative, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, military representative Commander of the Songhu Garrison Dai Ji, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhang Sixu, Secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Deng Zhongying and Li Tiezheng; the Japanese chief representative, Commander of the 9th Division Ueda Kenkichi, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru, Chief of the Naval Staff Shimada Shigetaro, Attaché Hayashi of the Japanese Embassy, and Japanese Consul Okazaki; representatives of the countries concerned, British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano, and French Minister's Representative Le Grand. The second article of the new draft of the ceasefire agreement was discussed and formally passed. This article stipulates that Chinese troops will temporarily be stationed on the current defense line pending future resolution. When the article was presented for discussion at yesterday's meeting, Vice Minister Guo reiterated his previous proposal to amend the phrase "pending future resolution" in the article. As a result of the discussion, a clause was added to this article stating that "This article cannot restrict the permanent authority of the Chinese government regarding the free movement of its troops." The article was then amended and passed.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Key Points of the Deadline <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>After several days of meetings, the new draft of the ceasefire agreement has formally passed the first, second, fourth, and fifth articles. Only the third article remains unresolved. This article stipulates the procedure for the withdrawal of Japanese troops and has always been the most difficult to resolve. The issue of the location in the procedure for the withdrawal of Japanese troops, namely the section adjacent to the Public Concession, has been discussed in several subcommittee meetings and a plan was drafted yesterday, awaiting final decision. However, the issue of the timing in the procedure for the withdrawal of Japanese troops remains deadlocked. This timing issue was the focus of yesterday's general assembly discussion. Both sides insisted without budging slightly. The neutral representatives also did not show any sign of compromise. Our side firmly insisted that, according to the basic principles of the ceasefire, the Japanese troops must gradually and completely withdraw to their original defenses before January 28th according to a certain procedure. The Japanese side stated that the first step for the Japanese troops to withdraw to the section adjacent to the Concession could be set for a certain period, but the second step to withdraw to their original defenses before January 28th must depend on the restoration of local conditions and cannot be set for a certain period. Our side refuted this, stating that martial law has now been lifted in the Concession, and all stores have decided to open for business on April 1st. The local conditions referred to by the Japanese side have actually been restored. Therefore, the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops must be specified. However, the Japanese side continued to evade and make excuses and could not make concessions. Both sides insisted, so yesterday's meeting was still at a loss regarding this point. The meeting has now reached the last five minutes, so it was decided to adjourn the meeting for one day today so that the Japanese side can consider it at length. The general assembly is scheduled to reconvene at 10:00 tomorrow morning to continue discussing this point. Therefore, tomorrow morning's meeting is truly the key to the success or failure of the entire situation.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Location Issue <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Military Subcommittee met at 10:00 yesterday morning in another room in the British Consulate and adjourned at 1:00 in the afternoon. Present were our representatives, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army Huang Qiang and Secretaries Guo Dehua and Yin Rugeng; the Japanese representatives, Chief of Staff of the Army Tashiro Kan'ichirō and Secretaries Kita, Abe, and Uehara; representatives of the countries concerned, Military Attaché of the British Embassy Sansom, Military Attaché of the American Embassy Trailester, Military Attaché of the French Embassy Pannavete, and Military Attaché of the Italian Embassy Faratini. The discussion on the location of the Japanese troops was continued. The opinions of both sides have largely been consistent and are awaiting final decision. The location of the Japanese troops' withdrawal has been seen in yesterday's newspaper, namely the Yinxiang area, the area around Yinxiang Port; the Jiangwan area, the area around the International Recreation Ground; and the Wusong area, the area from Wusong Town to Yunzaobang Zhang Huabang. However, the area around the Japanese Cemetery to the 63 Huayuan in Zhabei has not yet been decided. The Military Subcommittee has now announced its adjournment. The date of the next meeting will depend on the instructions of the chief representatives of both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Japanese Attitude <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st from the Japan United Press: Yesterday, Chief of Staff Tashiro telegraphed that Sino-Japanese ceasefire negotiations had stalled temporarily. The British representative presented a compromise proposal for Sino-Japanese reconciliation, scheduled to be discussed at the meeting on the 31st. After holding an important meeting, the General Staff Headquarters sent important instructions to Commander Shirakawa. The Army authorities' opinions on the British proposal are as follows: (1) Both armies cease all hostile actions to ensure a ceasefire. This item can be acknowledged because the Japanese army has already stopped military action. (2) The Chinese army will remain in place before the agreement is established. The purpose of this Japanese army action is to ensure the peace of Shanghai. This item is a natural condition. (3) The Japanese army will withdraw completely at its own discretion, and other countries are not allowed to interfere. The Chinese request to withdraw to the location before January 28th is absolutely impossible to acknowledge. The line of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong is an important location for military operations and cannot be conceded under any circumstances. With the roundtable conference making no headway, withdrawing troops to the concession-adjacent area is equivalent to the Japanese army abandoning its purpose of dispatching troops to Shanghai. The conference may break down because of this point, which cannot be helped. (4) The representatives of China, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy will form an international mixed committee to monitor the actions of the Chinese and Japanese armies. Japan acknowledges this item. (5) Regarding the issue of Japanese aircraft reconnaissance of the situation of the Chinese army, the Japanese army will prohibit reconnaissance except when necessary, but Japanese aircraft training flights cannot be stopped. (6) If the agreement can be established, the Japanese army will begin withdrawing troops one week later and must completely withdraw within a maximum of six weeks. It has been decided to acknowledge this.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Petition to the Court for Rent Reduction <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Rent Reduction Movement Committee, believing that some landlords are still engaging in forced evictions and reconstruction amidst the postwar economic hardship, yesterday dispatched representatives Zhang Yichen, Wang Manyun, and Cao Zhigong to petition the Special District Court. They were received by Chief Clerk Zhu Rongzu of the court. After the representatives presented their views, Clerk Zhu replied that in such a special social situation, the court would, within the bounds of law and reason, consider human sentiment. He suggested that the representatives send a copy of the decided rent reduction measures to the court for reference. The representatives, satisfied with the response, then departed. The petition of the committee is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, since the Shanghai Incident, all industries have stagnated, unemployment has increased, production has declined, and the social economy has experienced extreme panic. If no measures are taken to mediate, there will be many hidden dangers in the future. Therefore, the movement to reduce rent has become a major issue. Unexpectedly, during this period, landlords in this city continue to disregard the suffering of citizens, carrying out demolitions and forced evictions one after another. According to legal precedents, the exercise of rights should not infringe upon others. If the public interest is disregarded and only personal benefit is pursued, it is not only contrary to social morality, but also violates legal provisions. If unfortunately, other incidents are triggered, and the stability of the rear is jeopardized, it will also hinder the progress of resisting aggression and saving the nation. With this in mind, this committee has specially dispatched representatives Zhang Yichen, Cao Zhigong, and Wang Manyun to present their views, hoping that you will grant our request.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Shanghai Municipal Council's Method of Estimating Property Tax <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's 1931 annual report states that at the beginning of the year, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and other Chinese organizations raised objections to the Municipal Council's method of estimating property tax. In reality, the Municipal Council must use the estimated value as the basis for collecting taxes on properties for which the actual rental amount is unclear, which is permitted by Article 9 of the Land Regulations and consistent with municipal principles. This has been the practice for sixty years and was investigated and approved by the Consular Body in 1907. Generally, the Municipal Council relies on rent receipts, but difficulties sometimes arise, such as (1) properties occupied by the landlord themselves, which must be assessed by the Municipal Council; (2) properties occupied by friends or relatives of the landlord, where only nominal rent is paid, which cannot be used as a basis; (3) cases where a large key money or other conditions exist, so the rent is only nominal; (4) cases of forged rent receipts to deceive the Municipal Council, etc. To avoid misunderstandings and ensure consistent methods, the Municipal Council has appointed two valuers from the council and hired three external valuers to form a valuation committee, including one Chinese and one Japanese member. If taxpayers disagree with the valuation, they can submit an objection to the committee within 30 days. If they are still dissatisfied, they can appeal to the Council's "Finance, Taxation, and Appeals Committee" within another 30 days. The valuation becomes final after their assessment or if the taxpayer does not appeal within the deadline. It is noted that within this year, the valuation committee has reviewed the cases of 436 Zhongshe Road, 44 Henan Road, 446 Henan Road, China General Edison Company, Wing On Company, and the Catholic Church. Furthermore, Article 10 of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Regulations for the Collection of Property Tax, amended and promulgated on September 27, 1930, states: "The determination of rental value shall be based on the rent receipt or lease for the most recent two months. If there is a significant discrepancy between the house and the rental price, the department shall separately determine the rental price for the purpose of collecting property tax. For self-owned houses occupied by the owner, the Finance Bureau shall send personnel to determine the rental value.

This has drawn criticism from the outside world, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has also published an advertisement, causing many disputes.

<p>The Market Resumes Full-Day Trading Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, March 31, the gold bidding market was still stable, generally around 680 taels outside the pass. However, the movements of various brokers were drastically different. The silver market fluctuated repeatedly, with the pound rising and the dollar falling. The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar was the opposite of the previous day, with the US dollar rebounding against the pound. This caused the gold price to rise slightly. In the future, due to the confrontation between the bulls and bears, there will be ups and downs, but the people's minds are at peace. The market eventually declined. The opening price for May was slightly up by 1 liang and 8 qian, at 682 taels. Large silver rose by 16/3, and the forward price was 1/4. US silver fell by 1/4. However, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. quoted the same price for pound and dollar as before. Yuan Kangxiang &amp; Co. then dumped goods and the price immediately fell by more than 2 taels to 79 yuan and 5 qian. However, Chinese banks bought for April delivery at 8/7.75 for pound and Mitsui &amp; Co. offered 32.75 yuan for dollar. Zhejiang absorbed June delivery at 33 yuan. Various firms were also eager to buy. Hong Kang Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, etc., all made purchases, jumping by more than 5 taels, with only a few qian profit per transaction, reaching 85 taels at 9:50 AM. Later, Qian Changxiang, Yu Da, etc., took the opportunity to sell, and the price immediately fell by 4 taels. American Silver Company sold spot pound at 81.25, reaching 81 taels at 10:15 AM. Hengxing suddenly came to buy, adding 2-3 taels in a quarter of an hour, reaching 83 taels and 8 qian at 10:30 AM. Zhi Feng Yong, etc., sold, reaching 82 taels at 11:00 AM. Later, Chinese banks bought for April delivery at 32.625 yuan for dollar, and Hengxing, Futaiheng, and scattered shorts all entered, returning to over 2 taels, reaching 84 taels and a half at 11:20 AM. It was heard that Bombay had sold pound by telegram, and Huabi offered 32.875 yuan for May delivery dollar. Because recent pound for eight-part delivery at 18/125 was difficult to sell, and Deda Cheng and Wupin Set Head also sold, the price could not be sustained and fell by more than 5 taels, breaking through 80 taels, finally reaching 79 taels at 11:50 AM. At this time, buyers seemed active on the floor, pulling up slightly to close at 80 taels, a decrease of only 2 qian compared to the previous day. The maximum for the half day was 85 taels, and the minimum was 79 taels, with a fluctuation of 6 taels. The posted price was still 744 taels, with a premium of 63 or 4 taels to 59 taels. The afternoon closing price was 64 or 5 taels, the same as the previous day. Registered accounts for April delivery were 74 taels, for May delivery were 80 taels, and the water supplement was 73 taels. The raw silver was flat. The trading statistics on the floor showed that Daxie Yong, Hengxing, Hengyu Hong Kang Yong, etc., were all buying, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Tai, Yuan Heng, Futaiheng, Deda Cheng, and Heng Chang Yong were entering and exiting, and Yu Da, Yuan Kangxiang, Qian Changxiang, Kaitai, and Yifeng Yong were all selling. Today, April 1, there will be a full-day market.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Problem of Bond Market Opening May Be Resolved Within the Day <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The amount of futures trading left over from before the market suspension at the Chinese Securities Exchange is decreasing daily after two swaps. The number of transactions settled before and after is close to 2 million. As of yesterday, the remaining amount was only about 5 million, and the actual silver was only 1.5 million yuan. Therefore, future deliveries are not a problem.</p>
<p>According to news from various brokers, recent prices have been quite stable, with minimal price fluctuations compared to before the market suspension. Therefore, whether or not to open the market today is not a problem. The reason why it has not yet opened is that the Sino-Japanese peace negotiations have not yet been resolved, and the Japanese army has not yet withdrawn, so they are still waiting to see the development of the Ministry of Finance's order and the future situation. However, judging from the current circumstances, the resumption of bond trading should not be far off. The current existing amount of each bond futures transaction is listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the rice boats from various gangs in South Shanghai arrived around No. 40 in South Shanghai. The market was depressed. The opening price of North Japonica and early rice rose slightly by 1 jiao. Thin rice has been falling sharply for several days, and the arrival of boats has been sparse. The market has stabilized. Ocean long-grain rice was unremarkable. The demand for rice wine from Tongbian Yinyuan and other rice shops was still there, and the situation was hardening. The opening price for Changbang Bianyuan was 14 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen, and for top-grade Japonica was 14 yuan and a half to 14 yuan.

<p>About six or seven of the North Shanghai Rice Stores in Zhabei are trying to resume business, looking for reliable addresses and preparing to open. Recently, there has been a slight increase in the number of boats arriving from Suzhou Creek. Due to the large amount of foreign rice, the downward trend continues. Boat owners rushed to dock near the old garbage bridge, with only about 40 boats, mostly from Wuxi and Qingjiao. The opening price for Zhou Quanquan Japonica was 13 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, the price for Hua Yitai Japonica was 13 yuan and 2 jiao, the price for Xu Kunquan early rice was 13 yuan, the price for thin rice was 12 yuan and 7 jiao, the price for Ding Zhangsheng thin rice was 12 yuan and 1 jiao, and the price for Yinyuan was 13 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>

At 11:42 AM, they first arrived at the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum. All the members and accompanying staff got out of the cars and walked around, touring the scenic spots. As the spring sunshine was bright and all kinds of flowers were in full bloom, all the members showed joyful expressions. After staying for about 30 minutes, they drove to Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s Mausoleum, climbed up the steps, and gathered at the tomb gate at 12:30 PM. Film company photographers scrambled to take moving pictures. Then, led by the mausoleum staff, the members took off their hats and entered the memorial hall, successively signing their names. Then, they lined up in front of Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s statue, offered wreaths, and then filed into the tomb passage to view Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s marble statue and tomb passage. At 1:05 PM, the members descended the steps. President Wang, Minister Luo, and Representative Gu arrived and met the members of the investigation team halfway up the stone steps. They accompanied them down. According to the original schedule, they originally planned to visit the Central Stadium area, but due to the late hour, they could not go.

<h3 id="e54">Central Party Headquarters Hosts Banquet <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee of the Central Party Headquarters hosted a luncheon for the investigation team members on the 31st. Due to the members visiting scenic spots, the banquet did not begin until 1:20 PM. The attendees included the chairman of the investigation team, Lord Lytton, committee members General Claudel, General McCoy, Dr. Schnee, Count Madi, Secretary-General Haas and his wife, and accompanying secretaries. The Central Committee members present included Ye Chucang, Jiang Zuobin, Wang Jingwei, Zeng Zhongming, Chu Minyi, Zhang Daofan, Xiao Jishan, Luo Jialun, as well as Foreign Minister Luo, Representative Gu, Liu Ruiheng, and various directors and heads of departments from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, totaling more than 50 people. At the beginning of the banquet, Secretary-General Ye Chucang of the Central Party Headquarters delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Gentlemen, you have come from afar to pay your respects at the tomb of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Republic of China and the leader of our party. Our party extends our sincere gratitude to you. Dr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to the revolution, overcoming numerous hardships and dangers, finally overthrowing the autocratic regime and creating the Republic of China. He personally formulated the Outline of National Reconstruction and the Strategies for National Reconstruction, with far-reaching plans and meticulous details, serving as a model for the construction of the new China. Our party and the National Government follow these as our guidelines. However, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was not only a revolutionary and a practical statesman. The Three Principles of the People, which he personally formulated, contain great political ideals, not only to save China, but also to use the revival of the Chinese nation as a stepping stone to promote world peace, hoping to achieve a grand harmony. I still remember that when Dr. Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of the first Provisional President in the first year of the Republic of China, he first announced to the friendly nations of the world 'the true essence of the neighborliness of our people,' solemnly declaring his willingness to cooperate with all countries to advance world civilization infinitely. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen always hoped to cooperate with other countries not only in the large-scale construction of railways and other material constructions in China, but also in cultural undertakings that can integrate Eastern and Western civilizations and combine China's inherent morality with Western modern civilization to promote a new world culture. He would sincerely cooperate with all countries. In the same declaration, Dr. Sun Yat-sen also said that the Chinese nation's love of peace and law-abiding nature is rooted in instinct, and we will never lightly start wars unless forced to do so in self-defense. Although China is unfortunately in a period of serious national crisis, we still abide by this legacy and have never changed it. Before you arrived at the mausoleum, you passed a large stone archway inscribed with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's calligraphy 'Universal Love', which is also the meaning of Confucius's 'All within the four seas are brothers'. The international community is originally one family, and the relationship between countries is like brothers. In an organized family in China, if one brother acts recklessly towards other brothers, there must be family rules to punish him, so that the family can be harmonious. We also hope that the international community in our ideals is like this. This is nothing more than seeking peace, justice, and security in the international community. We admire your efforts for international peace very much, so I respectfully state Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and I also want all of you and the international community to understand that our party is a faithful follower of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. I wish you the completion of your great mission and your health." After Ye's speech, Lord Lytton delivered a reply on behalf of the delegation, saying briefly, "Mr. Secretary-General and gentlemen, thank you very much for your warm welcome today. Just now, we visited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, saw its solemn architecture, and thought of the greatness of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Unfortunately, we were unable to meet Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime, but we dare to assert that Dr. Sun Yat-sen is indeed one of the few great political creators. All politicians who read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy cannot help but admire him. The solemn and magnificent Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum was created by architects and workers, but we do not know that Mr. Sun Yat-sen is actually the creator of today's China and tomorrow's China, just like the engineers who built China, and you are the workers who built China. Today, we are pleased to hear the Secretary-General's instructions on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, which are based on peace and justice internationally." Then, he raised his glass to express his thanks. The banquet ended happily at 2:15 PM. (Central News Agency Telegram, 31st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Representatives from the press in the capital requested to meet with the investigation team. The Chinese delegation is arranging the meeting. The team is scheduled to meet at Lishi Society at 10:30 AM on the 1st to exchange views.</p>
<p>(Special Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The press in the capital and the Beijing-based reporters from national newspapers recently published a document respectfully informing the League of Nations Investigation Team, the peace envoys. The main points are as follows: The press in the capital and the Beijing-based reporters from national newspapers respectfully and warmly welcome the League of Nations Investigation Team, the peace envoys, who have graciously arrived. Since the September 18th Incident to this day, Japan has acted like a madman, not only occupying the entire three northeastern provinces by force, but also provoking the Shanghai War on January 28th. The Northeast and Southeast were trampled and ravaged by Japanese iron hooves at the same time. The loss of life and property is incalculable, and the Japanese army's massacre of the people is particularly unprecedented in human history. Japan has never severed diplomatic relations with or declared war on China. However, our land has been occupied by them, our houses have been burned down, our cultural institutions have been bombed, and our economic foundation has been shaken. Although the League of Nations and friendly nations have repeatedly advised, Japan's arson has only increased day by day, without any restraint, and will not stop until it achieves Tanaka's so-called goal of conquering the world. You have come to China with a great mission, and the world's hope for you is also very great. On the day of your arrival in Shanghai, our prosperous and wealthy Shanghai was reduced to ashes in the Japanese army's shelling and bombing. The Northeast, where the life of our nation is entrusted, is being covered up by the Japanese-made puppet state of Manchukuo, which is putting on a show to deceive the world. Having witnessed the terrifying ruins between Zhabei and Wusong, we wonder what your feelings are. One day, you will personally visit the eastern provinces that Japan has taken from us by force. We wonder what your feelings will be then. Do you also know why Japan is determined to invade the eastern provinces? The Japanese claims of overpopulation and that Manchuria is Japan's lifeline are all laughable and false propaganda. The reason why Japan must use all its strength to seize the eastern provinces is that the eastern provinces have inexhaustible food, minerals, forests, coal, and iron. With this supreme treasure, Japan can not only extend its power to northern and central China, attempting to realize its dream of a continental empire, but also use it as a base for war against the world, without worrying about military and economic blockades. Do you also know why Japan invaded Shanghai after seizing the eastern provinces? The Japanese propaganda about the beating of Japanese monks and the boycott of Japanese goods are all superficial excuses. In fact, the real reason for the Japanese army's attack on Shanghai is not here. In short, it is about four things: one is to divert the world's attention from the Northeast, two is to destroy China's cultural undertakings and economic</p>

<p>heart, three is to threaten the Chinese government to make it accept the conditions of losing power and humiliating the country, and four is to destroy the trade of various countries in the Yangtze River basin to demonstrate to the countries of the world. You must have heard all kinds of propaganda from the Japanese defaming China when you passed through Japan. Now that you have come to China and it has been two weeks, you must have a very clear understanding of the true situation of China. China has never been anti-foreign. Even in terms of economic severance of relations with Japan, the Chinese people refuse to trade with the Japanese because they cannot bear the Japanese oppression. This is a reasonable and very sad act. How can it be regarded as anti-foreign? If Japan realizes its past mistakes, withdraws its troops, returns the lost land, and compensates for all losses, China is willing to immediately restore economic relations with it. China believes that it is a peace-loving country that values credibility. China has never disregarded all legal treaty obligations. Cooperation and trade with friendly countries on the principle of equality and mutual benefit is particularly welcomed by the Chinese people. Today, in times of danger and difficulty, China is defending against Japan and preventing communism at the same time. It will overcome all difficulties, resist violent Japan, and safeguard world peace. You have sharp eyes and penetrating observations. We hope that you will not be deceived by Japanese propaganda. In short, no matter what, China will never give up an inch of land to others. The three northeastern provinces are a part of China that China will never give up and cannot separate. The responsibility for the Shenyang Incident, the Shanghai Incident, and the entire Sino-Japanese dispute lies entirely with Japan. If reason has not been extinguished and justice still exists, the League of Nations must fulfill its moral responsibilities. China trusts the League of Nations and respects covenants, but it will never beg for pity or complain to others. It also does not ask whether the world has the determination to stop the war. It only knows that China's survival depends on the struggle and efforts of our own people. If the three northeastern provinces are not recovered for one day, and if the Japanese troops in China are not withdrawn for one day, the Chinese people will not stop their actions to resist violent Japan for one day. No sacrifice will be spared. We dare to respectfully inform you of this, and we deeply hope that you will distinguish between right and wrong and judge what is fair, so that world peace will not be destroyed by Japan.

<h3 id="e121">US Advocates Restoration of Relations with Russia <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Due to Changes in the Far East Situation, It Does Not Recognize the Manchurian Puppet State The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun says that the issue of US recognition of Manchuria seems difficult to realize. Even the industrialists of that country do not want the government to recognize it for trade relations. Moreover, Secretary of State Stimson believes that it is legally impossible to recognize Manchuria as an independent country. Harvard University President Lowell recently expressed the opinion that Secretary of State Stimson's position will lead to a state of permanent unrest in international relations, which is contrary to the spirit of treaty enforcement, which seeks stability by eliminating international unrest. In terms of the current situation in East Asia, the trend is inevitably towards a US-Japan war. Walter Lippmann, editor of the New York World News, also expressed the opinion that it may not be possible to permanently fix a piece of French law that regulates the past, and that it can maintain to the end in the future. If it is unbalanced once, mankind will evolve into a major tragedy. Since the sudden change in the East Asian situation, the United States' understanding of the Far East has suddenly changed, and it is urgently seeking the necessity of establishing a country. Opinions are divided between the government and the public, but the issue of recognizing and restoring relations with Soviet Russia and promoting friendship between the two countries is especially attracting social attention. A large official, who remained anonymous, published a pro-Russian theory, saying that if Soviet Russia is strong, it can still maintain the balance of power in the Orient, and we eagerly hope to improve relations with Russia, and said that the reason why the United States does not recognize Soviet Russia is mainly due to three issues: (1) recognition of pre-revolutionary national debt, (2) security guarantee for the lives and property of Americans in Soviet Russia, and (3) prohibition of the promotion of communism. The first and second issues are no longer a problem today. As for the third point, judging from the recent situation in Soviet Russia, it is not worth worrying about. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun also said that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and the changes in the Far East situation, the theory of US recognition of Russia has gradually reached a climax. Currently, the United States is eager to restore diplomatic relations with Russia. According to unofficial observers, the first step for the United States to restore diplomatic relations with Russia is to first agree on trade and send commissioners.</p>

<p>Changsha Correspondence, Wu Qiwai, Deputy Commander of the Fourth Army, arrived in the province from Hengzhou on March 26th, and was warmly welcomed and banqueted by all parties. Those who came to the province with Wu included Xiao Maozhi, Chief of Staff, and Zhuang Wenyuan, Director of the Management Office. They stayed at the Dajixiang Hotel. Reporters from various newspapers inside and outside the province visited one after another. The following is a record of his conversation. (Question) Your army has come from afar, unafraid of difficulties and dangers, which is admirable. (Answer) Protecting the country and the people is the duty of a soldier, and we will not hesitate to go through fire and water. (Question) May I know the mission of your visit to the province this time? (Answer) This trip is to thank Commander He for his preferential treatment on the one hand, and to discuss with Commander He the future plans for suppressing bandits and resisting Japan in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi. Guangxi is also preparing to send troops into Jiangxi to suppress bandits and consolidate the rear. (Question) How was the situation along the way when your army entered Hunan from Quanzhou? (Answer) Before our army set out, we received Commander He's telegram instructing local officials along the way to take care of us, so we were warmly welcomed and sent off by local officials and people, and the passage was extremely smooth and convenient. (Question) When will your army arrive in Liling? (Answer) It can all arrive by the 28th of this month. Wu went on to say that the Japanese ambition to invade our country has been accumulated for a long time. Now that it has been launched, it will not be easily abandoned. Our country has become so weak because of the cowardice of the people. When people invade me, I do not resist. Giving in again and again will not satisfy the desire of the wolf's ambition. For the present plan, war is the only way to save the country. Long-term resistance is the only way out for China at present. It is said that the army has now been reorganized in Hunan and its designation has been changed. Wu is scheduled to go from the province to Liling on the 29th and supervise the troops to advance into Pingxiang. (March 28)</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Ganzhou County was surrounded by bandits the other day, and it was only recovered after a month. Xiong Shihui, Chairman of the Provincial Government, specially allocated 5,000 yuan yesterday to handle the post-disaster relief. The following is the text of Xiong's telegram to Xiao County Magistrate. Urgent telegram to Xiao County Magistrate of Ganzhou. The people of Ganzhou suffered greatly from the recent siege. Emergency relief and restoration of the bombed city walls should be carried out as soon as possible. The government is concerned about this and should allocate a large sum of money to handle the post-disaster relief. However, the treasury is empty and it is difficult to raise funds. Now, the Department of Finance is ordered to allocate 5,000 yuan to be used for relief and restoration of the city. Please handle it separately and report it. Xiong Shihui.</p>

<p>Songjiang, 26th: The three representatives of the League of Nations investigation team, from the US, France, and Germany, went to Hangzhou. The next day, they transferred to Beijing. During these two days, no aircraft were seen in the sky, and the people were at peace. However, after the investigators arrived in Beijing, starting on the 28th, the sound of airplane engines was heard every morning, circling the entire city. Yesterday (29th), at 9:00 AM, two Japanese aircraft flew to Hangzhou one after the other. After an hour, only one aircraft was seen flying back. It is assumed that the other returned to Shanghai via another route.</p>
<p>Correction: There are some inaccuracies in the report carried in yesterday's paper regarding the China East News Agency. There was no search of the [Temple Name] and no arrest of twelve suspected Japanese spies. It was most likely a misunderstanding involving twelve local vagrants (currently detained at the Public Security Bureau) who were previously rounded up by the military police investigation unit a few days ago. As for Li Shibin, the small workshop owner specializing in carving, he was reported to the military police investigation unit by someone accusing him of colluding with traitors and selling opium. After investigation, he was found to be innocent and will be released on bail.</p>
<p>Wuxi, 28th: At 9:30 AM, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft flew from Shanghai to Wuxi, moving very slowly and high in the clouds. It circled around the city for a long time, lasting twenty minutes, before flying northeast. Subsequently, a phone call from Jiangyin confirmed that after arriving in Cheng [Jiangyin], the same aircraft circled the along-the-Yangtze River fortresses and batteries several times, conducting reconnaissance for a long time, before flying towards Changshu.</p>
<p>Jiaxing, 29th: On the morning of the 29th, a little after 9:00 AM, four Japanese aircraft arrived. Two of them immediately flew elsewhere, while the other two circled in the airspace over Jiaxing, flying very low. The numbers and other details could be clearly identified. They circled for over forty minutes before leaving one after the other.</p>
<p>Xinfeng Town, Jiaxing: The night before last, over a dozen large men dressed in plain clothes, claiming to be water police officers, without coordinating with the local police, broke into the residence of Wu Yanqing and conducted a thorough search. Because Wu smoked opium, they arrested him and confiscated his opium paraphernalia. Other items were also taken away. Merchants throughout the town mistook this for a robbery and jointly closed their shops. The local defense corps then retrieved Wu and the opium paraphernalia, and telegraphed the Jiaxing water and land police agencies and the provincial authorities to report the robbery. The county government specially dispatched staff member Xiong Xiang, and the water police district headquarters specially dispatched special agent Xue Zhichao to conduct an on-site investigation. It was then discovered that Zhou Zhipeng, the water police guard captain, and Zhou Linchu, the water police investigator, had acted without authorization in seizing the opium, leading to the misunderstanding among the people. The two officers then mediated the situation, persuading the merchants to reopen their shops and guaranteeing that Wu and others would not be further prosecuted, thus resolving the matter.</p>
<p>Nantong: The area along the Yangtze River in the Tongzhou and Jiangbei regions has recently been heavily fortified by the [missing numbers] Route Army. However, in the coastal areas of Lusi and Juegang, over a thousand Hai Prefecture sea bandits have gathered, robbing cargo ships, kidnapping for ransom, and raiding the coast. The bandit leader, Yan Zhenling, has been exploited by the Japanese to specifically harass the coastal areas of Jiangbei. The Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner has specially dispatched Xiao Guangcan's troops to suppress them. The provincial government has also dispatched the Shen Fengshan-led Security Maritime Guerrilla Brigade and provincial and county water and land police teams to assist in the suppression, with a deadline of ten days to clear them out. The bandits in Sanjia Town have retreated into the sea, and Shen's troops are in pursuit. Maritime areas of Tongzhou, Rugao, Hai'an, and Qidong counties are under martial law, with defense corps responsible for blocking and apprehending fleeing bandits.</p>
<p>Chongming: Since last winter, due to the rampant sea bandits in Jiangbei and the importance of local defense, the province dispatched a provincial security regiment to garrison this county. The regimental commander, Cao Pang, has worked diligently on local defense. Later, Commander Cao was ordered to be transferred to Songjiang, leaving only one company of the regiment stationed in Chongming. Initially, discipline was good, but recently, the soldiers of the company, under the pretext that local gentry were colluding with bandits, selling opium, and smuggling enemy goods, have been carrying out searches, unauthorized arrests, torture, and beatings, stopping at nothing. After people intervened and donated funds to assist the military, they were released. As a result, the local gentry have fled completely. It is now reported that various organizations have jointly filed complaints with the province, requesting their transfer to reassure the local residents.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Troop Withdrawal Conference and the Guns of Taicang <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>The troop withdrawal and ceasefire conference has been held for more than ten days, but because the Japanese side lacks sincerity, there has been no result. Yesterday's conference discussed the timing of the troop withdrawal. Our side insisted that if the Japanese side does not determine the date of troop withdrawal, we will not sign the agreement. However, the result of the conference was still a slight progress, and the difficulties were not overcome.</p>
<p>I originally thought this troop withdrawal conference was meaningless. The only thing that has some meaning is the timing of the troop withdrawal. In short, to hold a conference, we must wait for the Japanese troops to withdraw completely. If the Japanese troops do not withdraw completely, any conference will not be able to be held, and even if it is held, it will not have any results. If Japan determines the timing of the troop withdrawal, even the issue of the withdrawal location can be left undiscussed, because temporary garrisoning will not cause any problems.</p>
<p>Today, while holding a troop withdrawal conference, they are actively attacking in the Taicang area. According to yesterday's newspaper reports, while the ceasefire talks are discussing the troop withdrawal issue, the Japanese army in Taicang, taking advantage of our side's lack of defense, occupied Taicang yesterday morning. The residents in the city fled completely. This is clearly an attempt to intimidate our country with gunboat diplomacy. Even if our country is weak, we would rather accept an alliance under the city [surrender]. Moreover, the resolution of the League of Nations states:</p>
<p>(1) The League of Nations does not recognize or allow the violation of China's territorial integrity and political sovereignty.</p>
<p>(2) It solemnly declares that resolving the current dispute by force and other coercion is illegal.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that this troop withdrawal conference is fundamentally ineffective. Moreover, judging from the situation of this conference, the other side's attendees either draw small portraits or snore and sleep, fully demonstrating their arrogant, rude, and playful national character. I do not believe that such a conference can have good results.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I heard a certain Japanese person say, "China needs to forgive us. This time, Japan has suffered countless losses of personnel and money in the Shanghai war. May I ask what we can take back to report to the government?" I can answer, "This time, the 19th Route Army suffered heavy losses of personnel in the Shanghai resistance. The people of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and other places have suffered countless losses of life, property, and homes. May I ask what we can take back to report to the people?"</p>
<p>Moreover, this war was initiated by them, and suffering some small losses is their own fault. What crime have the people of our country committed against the Japanese to suffer such major devastation? May I ask who we should settle accounts with?</p>

<p>— Chen Jimei</p>
<p>On the last clear morning of January in the twenty-first year, the ashen clouds covered this prosperous Shanghai shore. Incendiary bombs and heavy artillery played a symphony of nature, and flesh and iron fragments flew together with the heroic souls of China. Silver-gray iron birds carried the mission of war demons, and crawling iron tigers devoured the gods of peace. How many buildings could not escape the trampling of iron hooves? The messengers of death displayed the most terrifying ferocity. The once bustling street is now so quiet, like the Taklamakan Desert or a deserted capital. Wisps of white smoke still rise from the rubble, and the faces of seven or eight victims show grief and indignation. In the breeze, a terrifying wail is heard, and a small Chinese national is desperately fleeing, chased by several beasts from an enemy country. Four enemies who invaded our land rushed out from the front. What skills does a small life of eight or nine years have? Trembling and wailing cannot move the sympathy of the Japanese devils. Six beasts tightly trapped him in the center, and one with glaring tiger eyes advanced to search his body. The small, weak one did not carry any dangerous items, only a small penknife that was so new, but this could not hide the cruel bestiality of the Japanese devils. Justice and humanity had long been entered into desolate graves by power. The penknife was deeply plunged into the heart of the small, weak one. After a painful wail, there was only a weak groan. Fresh red blood spurted out like a fountain, adding another pitiful ghost to the banks of the Huangpu River.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Iron <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>Iron is very abundant and inexpensive, and its properties are excellent, so its uses are very extensive. Now, I would like to introduce it to you: According to "The Beginning of the Iron Age" by Montelius, China was indeed the first to use iron. Cui Bao's "Notes on Ancient and Modern Times" says: "The Yellow Emperor fought with Chi You in the wilderness of Zhuolu. Chi You made a great fog, and the soldiers were all lost. Therefore, he made a compass cart to show the four directions, and then captured Chi You." Making a compass cart must require a magnetic needle, and making a magnetic needle requires iron, so it can be known that our country already used iron during the time of the Yellow Emperor. Calculating the time, it was about 2700 BC. Montelius's book says that Egypt used iron in 1200 BC, which was the earliest use of iron in the West. If calculated, China used iron 1500 years earlier than them. But now, look at how others use iron and how we use it ourselves? Our descendants are unworthy and should quickly exert themselves.</p>
<p>Speaking of iron, it is a chemical element, belonging to the metal category, and its symbol is Fe. It looks grayish-white. It has excellent ductility; the strength and tensile resistance of iron wire are the best among metals. It is very difficult to melt it because its melting point is extremely high. Its magnetic susceptibility is very good; therefore, iron things can be attracted by magnets (commonly known as lodestones). The properties of iron are divided into wrought iron, steel, and cast iron, depending on the amount of carbon it contains.</p>
<p>Wrought iron is iron with a carbon content of less than 0.5%. Its properties are the same as pure iron. It is both strong and ductile; when placed in a fire and heated red, it softens and is very easy to forge into various shapes. It can also be magnetized, but it is not easy to preserve, so it is used to make temporary electromagnets.</p>
<p>Steel is iron with a carbon content of about 1%. When heated red, it can also soften, just like wrought iron. The melting point is lower than pure iron, so it is easier to cast various utensils than pure iron. Steel that is heated red and then rapidly quenched in cold water can increase its hardness. Steel is very easy to magnetize and also has the property of preserving magnetism; various permanent magnets are made of steel.</p>
<p>Cast iron is iron with a carbon content of about 4%. Its melting point is the lowest of the three. The iron initially smelted from iron ore is cast iron. If it is rapidly cooled during smelting, it contains a compound of iron and carbon and is white in color, so it is called white cast iron. If it is gradually cooled after smelting, it will precipitate graphite (also a type of carbon), turning gray and called gray cast iron. If steel is mixed with 8% manganese or 1% chromium, its hardness will be even greater. Wrought iron containing 3% nickel becomes strong and elastic. However, iron containing sulfur or phosphorus is brittle and unsuitable for practical use.</p>
<p>Iron can combine with oxygen. Ordinary ironware, when left for many days, will develop a layer of yellow rust; this is because iron comes into contact with oxygen in the air and combines into iron oxide. Iron can also combine with sulfur, chlorine, and other substances to form other materials.</p>
<p>Iron is used in the mechanical industry because of (1) its strength; (2) its ability to soften when heated red; (3) the ability to obtain arbitrary hardness and elasticity through changes in heating and cooling; (4) its abundant production and low price. Steel can be used to manufacture sharp weapons, long rails, giant ships, strong decks, tall bridges, precise machinery, and all other building materials. Cast iron is used to manufacture iron pipes, iron pillars, and various utensils. Wrought iron, because of its temporary magnetic properties, as I mentioned above, can be used to make a temporary electromagnet; it is used in electric bells and telegraph machines. A type of electromagnet in electromagnetic cranes is also made of wrought iron. However, pure iron is not very useful; however, refined iron powder is used in medicine for anemia.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Spring Dreams <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Lai Chengyuan</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I have now actually experienced the saying "Spring is full of dreams." I, who don't usually dream much, or if I do, it's very rare, have found that this spring, the realm of dreams has naturally expanded and surged. While deeply asleep in the land of sweet dreams, everything in the dream is vivid and lifelike, completely enchanting me, like Liu Houzhu's pleasure in forgetting his homeland.</p>
<p>I remember last night, after reading the extra edition of the newspaper due to the current situation, I suddenly felt the arrogance and tyranny of imperialism in my mind! At the same time, I immediately thought that the physical weakness of the Chinese people is naturally the root cause of the lack of popular sports!</p>
<p>"What you think about during the day, you dream about at night." In that fleeting moment, my aspiring heart reached the boiling point. My legs seemed to have grown wings and were striding towards S City, running madly. Unconsciously, I began a long-distance race with countless athletes. The spectators along the way stood like a mountain, seemingly filled with admiration for our perseverance and courage. Mile after mile, S City was in sight. Amidst the cheers, I suddenly snatched the championship trophy. I was ecstatic and finally felt that I had stood tall with pride.</p>
<p>The merciless alarm clock finally rang, calling back its owner from his five-minute dream of wealth and glory. In the quiet room, on an uneven and unsteady Wuxi bed, covered with a tattered and grayish-yellow quilt, still slept a sickly-looking Eastern man with dull eyes. The illusion of the recent past had turned into fleeting smoke in the blink of an eye. The sickly man was still a skinny and weak patient!</p>
<p>But then again, my dream is just a small and insignificant page. Everyone knows that what aggressors think about daily is the omnipotence of force, and what they dream of must be how to use force. What capitalists think about daily is the omnipotence of money, and what they dream of must be how to use money. As for the young people who chase after desires like butterflies, they undoubtedly have amorous dreams. The officials who are as greedy as flies naturally have dreams of wealth and power. So, the truth of dreams, the thread of dreams, can be said to come from desires and the environment. It can also be said that they represent everything in the world.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Invention of Anti-War Rays <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Yi Zang</p>
<p>Since the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Anti-War Treaty have been trampled upon by violent nations, peace-loving humanitarians have been eagerly trying to eliminate future wars and researching fundamental methods of resistance, especially scientists, who have been focusing on the elimination of weapons.</p>
<p>Recently, a young man in Germany named Grotte-Schemkes has invented a kind of "anti-war ray." This ray can completely nullify the effectiveness of modern scientific warfare weapons, whether gunpowder bullets or things with destructive and explosive properties. For example, sea mines laid on the seabed, land mines buried underground, and bombs on airplanes in the air will immediately explode when illuminated by this ray. Moreover, even when the location of the target is unknown, this ray can be emitted mechanically in a cone shape, universally reflecting up, down, left, and right. Therefore, gunpowder bullets hidden in warehouses and explosives carried on the body will not only fail to harm others but will harm oneself.</p>
<p>Currently, the Scientific Research Institute of the US Navy's Great Lakes region outside Chicago, USA, is testing this ray. Once the effectiveness of the test is significant, they will buy the patent rights for the mechanical invention from the young German. Then, all kinds of murderous weapons in the world will have to perish together.</p>
