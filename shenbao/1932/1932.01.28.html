<p>（日内瓦）國聯理事會今日開秘密會議、中日代表均未出席、計論可否以强有力之警告致日政府、反對日海軍繼續向上海進發、聞俟得上海方面確實消息證明可施此舉、理事會即將以此警告送致日政府、理事會星期一開會重行討論中日遼案爭端時、曾定星期三舉行公開會議、今巳展期至星期四、以待私人談判滿洲問題之結果、此間目光現咸注於上海之局勢、中代表顏惠慶博士及日代表佐藤隨時以消息報告理事會、中日爭案之秘密討論、刻在進行中、惟當局迄未有何公佈、刻仍待果京南京續來電訊、又聞理事會各代表均向其本國政府請新訓令、如理事會决議以强有力之警告致日政府、則將以何爲根據、未有消息傳出、理事會因調查委員團須在兩水之後始能行抵遠東、故目下頗受窒礙、（二十六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）昨晚國聯行政會開秘密會議時、議長彭古秘書長德魯蒙及英德意代表先接見日代表佐藤、繼接見中代表顏博士、聞彭古對於上海現有之局勢、及防止衝突擴大之必要、有警關之言論、並向日代表詢問此事之最近消息、日代表出電報數通、表示時局稍有進步、但日代表聲稱、抵制日貨之機關、以上海爲集中點、日本决計保護其國人利益但亦極願避免爭端之擴大、尤願避免干涉上海他國之利益、日兵確己登岸者、不過駐滬英兵三分之一云、彭古詢佐藤、願否在國聯行政會公開會議時發表使人寛慰之宣言、佐藤答稱、星期一日渠己在公開會議中發表遠大性質之言論、但渠在原則上不反對再發昨己發過之言論、云彭古稱、行政會不欲研究十二月十日以前之事件、因行政會前此會議己研究之也、行政會現所最注意者、厥爲上海地位也云、據昨晚佈告、今日午後四時將再開行政會秘密會議、届時中日代表皆不出席、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）路透社在負責方面探悉、外傳國聯行政會决定向日本發出關於日本擬在上海有何舉動之警告一說、並非事實、行政會現巳行者、不過議長彭古勸令雙方勿激烈行事耳、今日行政會會員分别接見中日代表後、决定此種辦法、今晨行政會辦理其他會務、未曾於公開會議時提出滿洲問題、行政會所處理者、大都爲知識合作敎育攝影借欵統一等問題、議行頗速、超過預定程序、故原定明日舉行之會議、己展至一月二十八日、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）昨夜調查委員團各國代表與日本代表佐籐談話之際、有人主張請該代表在行政院下次公開會議時發表宣言、正式承認滿洲門户開放政策、如該國答復美國照會所云、此外日本當尊種國聯會盟約所載各種原則、亦須剴切聲明、凡此各節多有爲難、宣以何種方式出之、即將賡續接洽、行政院似己同意在本届會議時、圖謀通過一種新决議案、日本人對於此項要求、雖云迭次宣言業巳給有滿意結果、此後或仍贊成上項意見、亦未可知、據某某日本人宣言、東京政府最顧慮之點、端在防止反日運動、此項運動之中心點、似在上海一隅云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）據今晨國聯中人評論理事會秘密會議、及其後理事會主席彭古與中日總代表會話之語氣觀之、中國如援引國聯會章第十六條、以處置中日爭端、則理事會將加反對、聞彭古昨與中日總代表分别會話時會稱、理事會會員大多數絶對反對援引國聯會章第十六條、因理事會必須接到調查委員團之報告後、始能進行一切也、該國在四月以前、未能開始辦公、故在五月間理事會開會以前、難望有切實行動云云、同時顏博士與佐藤均謂擬請本國政府勿作足以增重中國尤其是上海事態之任何行動、滬案爲今日此間衆目所注之焦點、故理事會現在着力和緩上海之形勢、蓋美國之態度、此間稱爲凶兆也、然聞下事會對於滬案、亦不過準備以强有力之警告、直接致中日兩國、以免形勢愈趨嚴重、彭古己被推草擬此文、經星期四日公開會議認可後、即將分致中日兩國、但在星期四日以前、幕後雖有談判、而一切將置之不問也、（二十七日國民社電）</p>

<p>紐約美國官員現正密切注視上海之發展、昨日胡佛總統與内閣會商此事、繼又與國務卿史汀生會談、史氏之政策、迄今爲和緩的、惟現聞其政策可稱爲「决計維持美國之權利」、據紐約講壇報載稱、就現象觀之、國務院現將向英國建議、以期必要時在一條陣線上取共同行動、該報又謂國務院巳有訓令致駐滬總領事、大約乃涉及國務院之態度、即日本以武力干涉公共租界、不能爲人所原諒是、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦泰晤士報華盛頓訪員今日電稱、英美兩國在上海公共租界利害相同、今是否能變爲合作行動、將拭目以覘之、繼稱就美國於一月七日致牒中日兩國而論、此種合作、可謂現尚未之有也、第滿案與滬案顯然大相逕庭、美國今巳公然建議合作、英國若加拒絶、則將令美國爲之不解其理由何在也、該訪員又謂據可靠方面消息、華盛頓願與英國取一致之外交行動、即一方面提醒中國覺悟目前可有之危險、一方面不使日本藉口行封鎖行動是、至於華盛頓重視倫敦之决議、則不言可喻云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦每日電聞報載稱、據昨日美國消息、英國因上海時局曾向日本致送照會、頃由此間官塲切實否認、英國政府對於上海時局因不能無惶慮、但目前未向日本提出交涉、據一般人意見、公共租界必爲日本所尊重、中日兩國如果衝突、日本軍隊即在華界佔據若干地點、英國亦未便提起抗議、蓋自一千九百二十七年以來、他國軍隊亦有同樣行爲故也、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦今晨彙聞報載前上海字林報主筆格林一文、題爲「上海禍、」此文印於前幅、佔四欄地位、甚爲人注意、據格林之意、日兵之在滬登岸、使世界各國皆直接注意於對中日間之爭、日本此舉將促成中政府之傾覆、激起全國之共産潮流、且或釀成美日間之戰局、上海如裝置燃物料之箱、雖外人租界中百萬華人、大半爲和平而有秩序之商人、但亦含有極强暴之份子、其人對於日本行動之氣憤、現巳達於沸點、中政府此時幾巳破産、如軍隊無餉、則危機甚鉅、因兵士勢必易爲共産黨所利用、今共産黨在中國己如躉草之勃起矣、日本不難佔據大上海之中國官署·兵工廠·飛行塲·及兵營等處、試問届時列强能袖手旁觀、無動於中乎云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦倫敦彙聞報今晨復有社論、使人注意上海時局之嚴重、謂上海爲國際城市、居民三百萬、其中有未受良好紀律訓練之中國兵士、及狂熱而無秩序之中國學生、苟外兵佔據之、恐將發生極可駭人之慘變、結果有未可逆料者、日人所謂之華盛頓恫嚇、實乃一種警告、以示如日本在中國干涉不己、或將發生何種反響耳云、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c16">召集國難會議平議（上）彬 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>何謂「國難」其戰與權如何</p>
<p>自九一八事件發生寗粤協議和平而後。「集合全國力量共赴國難」之論調即一時龐然而興汪精衞氏曾有組織國難救國會議之主張。孫科氏亦曾有召集人民代表會議之主張。四届一中全會宣言。則更明白昭示全國以决「立即召集國難會議。與國民救國會議。以定救國之根本方針。」今國難會議己正式由行政院會議决定委派專員籌備。并聘定會員。確定會期矣。處此千鈞一髮之危殆情勢下。集合全國英彥於一堂以共商救國之根本方針」舉爲必要。意則尤善。吾人於此。更復何說。</p>
<p>獨是茲事體大非等兒戲會議而爲定救國之根本方針則此會即爲我國家生命之所託。吾人詳加思慮則有若干問題。尚覺有舉以向政府當局質疑之必要。</p>
<p>會議而曰「國難」。則顧名思義。當可知此會之召集。特爲救國家之危難。</p>
<p>然而「國難」今己成爲一極普遍而又極含混之名詞。謂爲專指外患也可。謂爲專指「水災」或「匪禍」亦無不可。吾人認爲此一名詞。之意義。必有詳明之確定。而後會議始不至成爲無的放矢。換言之。即吾人必先認淸何者爲國難。而後始足以言會議「如何赴國難。」「如何打破國難。」固矣。東北論亡。外患日益緊急。誠爲我國當前之大難。然而除外患外。災黎之飢寒。災區之荒凉。獨非國難乎。敎育之停頓。財政之破産。實業之凋敝。以及整個政治之混。亂陷於無政府狀態。獨非國難乎。今日召集國難會議之目的將專爲對付外交問題乎。抑將併内政而同時討論乎吾人認爲國無内亂。必不致外侮。同時政治如淸明。政治組織如健全從政者如都能以國家與人民之利益爲前提克盡其職責則内亦必不致亂。故今日之所謂國難與其謂爲專指外患。母寗謂爲着重於内政。禦侮守土。政府負一專責。即應竭全力以赴之。無討論之餘地。亦即無召集國難會議之必要在和平會議與一中全會中。多着重於政體問題之討論。與職位之分配。而於外交問題。則極少討論。從可知政府之所謂國難不爲專指外交。實尤着重於對内諸艱問題。然乎否乎吾人莫能决此其一端也。</p>
<p>會員旣巳聘定矣。會期亦己確定矣但此會之性質究如何。其職責又如何。政府旣未明白宣示。吾人實懷疑迷惘而莫從窺測。依據一中全會宣言中有曰國難會議與國民救國會議之目的有二。其一爲集中全國專門人才之計劃使成一整個的準備。其二爲集中人民之意見。使成一整個的表現·····以復我疆土完我主權。又據國府一月十九日召開國難會議明令有云。</p>
<p>迄於今日。内憂甫息外患方長凡我國人亟應淬厲精神共同禦侮·····各本救國之誠。共謀自衛之道。一心一德。濟此艱危」。復據國府發出聘請國難會議會員聘書有云。「近因外侮憑陵。侵略日亟。·····政府凛危厦之難支。矢巨川之共濟期紓國難。浼聘邦賢」。是則召集國難會議之目的應專爲復我疆土。固我主權」。「本救國之誠。謀自衛之道」矣。换言之即國難會議之。職責」專爲「其謀自衛。」自衛　外。其他種種即非所能過問是則國難會議之「職責」。固己微乎其微矣。國政可由省數人龍斷。國民不得而過問國有外侮則推之於國民。搜諸情理。詎能謂是以今日之情勢。觀國内種種。糟成一團敎育固不當維持耶。財固不當整理耶。軍人專政與政客播弄。固不當裁制耶一切内政。固不急待整飭耶。人民困陷水火固不當急爲拯拔耶而獨限。於對外政權我應堅持而外侮則應人民抗禦。難會議之召集固僅爲是耶次之任何組織。必須有其法律之依據。必須確定其權限。今日之國難會議究爲民衆團體乎。抑爲整個政治組織中一部分乎。爲暫時之組織乎。抑爲長久之組織乎。爲僅備諮詢之會議乎。抑爲立法或執行之會議乎。其决議案有無拘朿政府之能力。則以一謎也。日前某中委談。「國難會並非立法機關亦非執行機關。不過討論出辦法來。供中央之參考。從前一黨專政。不許其他勢力參加政治工作。今國難日亟。不得不廣開言路。使黨外人才亦得一參政之機會」。誠如此談。則國難會議。直無權限可言。集數百人討論。成爲决議。貢之政府。政府認爲可採。則採之認爲不可採。則棄之。在另一方面。則又恰爲以糖果騙小孩。一若曰政府今己予人民以參政之機矣。巳廣開言路矣徒有其名而無其實。徒有形式。而毫無權力是敷衍人民并欺騙人民也。國危至此。政府而尚忍敷衍人民欺騙人民吾人誠不敢信。亦不忍信然乎否乎此又一端也</p>

<p>（南京）國聯行政院己於二十五日開會、我國代表在此會之態度、至堪注意、聞首席代表顏惠慶氏、曾於本月十一日電外交部請示方略、外交部長陳友仁氏巳於二十四日電復顏代表、其訓令包含政府在會議中所採政策之綱要、因此綱要尚未經中央政治會議正式通過、故外部尚未正式發表、茲記者曾與外部某君談話、探得内容大略如左、</p>
<p>一、我國代表將在會議中重復申述中國政府對國聯行政院上年九月三十日、十月二十四日、及十二月十日、迭次决議、均巳遵守、中國政府對於十二月十日派遣調查團來華之决議、尤表歡迎、</p>
<p>二、我國代表將鄭重申述以下四點、自十二月十日國聯行政院决議成立後、日本（甲）以武力佔據遼寗省政府最後所在地之錦州、美國政府照會中日兩國聲明最近錦州方面之軍事行動、業將九月十八日以前在南滿最後存留之中華民國政府行政權威、破壞無餘、蓋即爲日本此種戰爭行爲而發、（乙）日本不獨未曾遵照國聯行政院决議將軍隊撤退至沿南滿鐵路附屬地内、抑且以兵力逼迫中國政府軍隊退至山海關内、現日本己將東三省全境用武力佔據、（丙）日本軍隊、近更進攻熱河省境、是其對中國領土侵略、實際上己超越滿洲區域以外、（丁）日本對中國作戰與軍事行動、不僅擴展至熱河省境、並且擴展至華北華中、（例如在上海之恐嚇行爲）及中國南部、希圖（一）威迫中國承認日本併呑滿蒙、及（二）迫使中國中央與地方政府取締對日愛國行動、</p>
<p>三、在將來議事日程討論中、中國代表將提議請國聯行政院執行盟約第十六條之規定、并聲明此是遣派調查團後矯正日本破壞公約之最有力方法、</p>
<p>該訓令中並對顏代表說第三項提案之要旨、在造成一種新局勢與機會、無論爲國聯所通過與否、至少可使我國能夠根據華府九國條約、或利用非戰公約召集國際會議、以解决滿洲問題、且此提案與對日絶交、係相輔而行、絶交並非將中日間關係完全破壞以趨於戰、乃僅僅停止中日兩國外交來往、以造成國際間之新局勢、使國際會議召集、易於實現、又聞此訓令發出後、某國暗中阻止顏代表提出第三項甚力、前中國總統府法律顧問韋羅貝氏並向顏氏獻議、謂提議執行盟約第十六條、即是戰爭狀態成立、勸顏審愼、又聞某方面亦曾電顏氏囑勿提出盟約第十六條、以免輕啓戰端云云、二十五日開會時、顏代表演說日本之侵略狀態、與訓令内容大致相同、獨關於提案一層、</p>
<p>似尚未實現、顏代表演說時、有中國極願在盟約第十一條謀一解决方法、但必需援用其他條欵之機、己日迫一日等語、然則顏代表將來於討論時、究竟將依訓令提出十六條、抑將採納韋羅貝之獻議、仍依舊提十一條、現尚未接電告也、（二十七日專電）</p>

<p>國難會議之宗旨在解决國難，這是顧名思義可以推測而知的。但是職權没有公布，辦法没有明文，當事的人還不能把它弄淸楚，何况一般的人，那是更加糢糊了。可是有一個東西是用黑的白的發表出來了。這東西是行政院公布的被聘會員的名單。</p>
<p>我們試拿這名單來研究一番吧。這些會員，無論他們過去的歷史是怎樣不同，現在的政見怎樣相左，却有一個共同之點他們都是名人　有名的人，姓名在報紙上白相過，在當局的荷包裏温存過。這個國難會議的主要成分是名人，國難會議只可算是名人會議，至多止可以算是一個名人對國難之條陳會議。專家會議都說不到，因爲内中有許多位不是專門家。</p>
<p>這名單的根本錯誤不在所有而在所無　在不應無者盡無。中華民國的主人翁之絶大多數，誰也不能否認是農人與工人。我們在這名單中可能找出一個自己動手種田的農人或是一個自己種手做工的工人？國難當頭不把絶大多數的主人翁請出來親自解决，何能打破這個難關？</p>
<p>有人說被聘的會員個可以放下屠刀立地成佛，即人人可以代老百姓說話。近年來的政治就壞在這個代字。始而代老百姓說話，繼而代老百姓吃飯，終而代老百姓當國，弄得老百姓始而有話無處說，繼而有飯無法吃，終而有國無力保。代！我願中華民國明日的字典裏没有這個傷心的字！</p>

<p>『天寳遺事』張九齡少年時。家養羣鴿。每與親知書信往來。以書繫鴿足上。依所敎之處。飛往投之。目之爲飛奴。按此在唐朝時己有之。不過未及於軍用。</p>
<p>『宋史夏國傳』仁宗慶曆中。桑懌征元吴。於道旁得數銀泥盒。中有動躍聲。不敢發。總管任福至。發之。乃懸哨鴿百餘。自中起。盤旋軍上。於是夏兵四合。福力戰軍没。按此則用之軍事者。</p>

<p>又近世亦有之。洪楊之難。曾國荃圍南京城時。其兄國藩以欽差大臣駐節安慶。軍中日報。用鴿傳遞。見朱梅菴所著『客窗瑣聞』一書。據云所畜鴿。數且盈百也。</p>

<p>電影明星胡蝶女士之自述</p>
<p>在一個斜風細雨驟然交織着冬寒的一個傍晚時候，京滬車送回我們上海來。上海是仍舊怎樣熙熙攘攘，和我們未去北平前没有一些兩樣·，但我們是帶了些北方的眞實的恐怖回來的，尚彷彿有些新的隔膜了。</p>
<p>同時，我們的隔膜也正如人家的隔膜，中國本來就是一個相互隔膜的集團，相互疑猜，相互不信任，相互破壞，相互詐欺，相互做損人不利己的事。我們也算得不幸，生存在這樣的環境之中，於是即使像我這樣渺小的一個，也不免於受到更外於意想之外的種種流言的誹謗了。</p>
<p>我總是這樣想··社會爲什麽對待女子這樣刻薄呢？我是什麽待遇都遭受過，往往有許多我自己所不知道的事而人家是似乎千眞萬確的那樣傳說着了··在這種待和遇之下，可眞不容易過，要是置諸不聞不問，會得使議嘲之上又加了護嘲，要是去辨正呢，我一千個事實似乎還抵不上人家半句謠言，好像什麽不應該做的事全應該由女子做出來，就是你不曾做，硬說你做了還不由你辨正。那麽，究竟還有什麽方法可以做一個相當的保障呢？</p>
<p>說起來，自我從事於水銀燈下的生活，也很有幾個年頭。當這一個職業的開始，無非是爲了趣味和生活的縱的方面要求，像我現在的收穫，在那個時候是不曾夢想到，但像我現在的痛苦，在那個時候又何嘗夢想到呢？所以，我對於現在的予盾的我自己，除了忠誠於我的工作，求我的工作給我以撫護與信任以外，其他是不敢有所奢望了。</p>
<p>車站。由張團長即日過江。到京市籌辦外套。幸中央軍校存有退伍官兵的大衣尚多。並蒙賜予權用。禦寒問題。才稍可解决。始於三十日整師前進。</p>
<p>車到濟南時。因受命令不許下車。午膳時每人僅發給大餅各數枚。聊當飯食。有一位南方同志。很不慣吃這食品。無奈五臟廟又不爭氣。祗得勉强　下。所費時間竟三十多分鐘有奇。我在旁見他着實可憐。不禁地問他道。「同志。你吃這東西可苦了」。他說。「不。不苦。國亡了。想吃這東西也難呢。」這句話是如何的沉痛啊。</p>
<p>此行使我們不敢忘謝的。還有各處當郵差的同胞們。蒙他們埀愛。凡是本團的信件。莫不妥速投到。即封面僅寫着探「投兩字的文牘。也能勞查給與。這累他們特别費神。眞敎我們感激而惶愧哩。</p>
<p>自京至平。全個隊伍的精神仍舊十分猛活。中途也有數人加入。尤其可貴的。有一位同志他竟在蘇州趕到這裏北平來入伍。一股像巨瀾的至誠。難怪値得人們稱許。但有一位同志的人格被我們發覺了他的罪惡。經幹。議决驅除。臨時也有幾位吃不得苦的同志。懇請退回後方工作。我們也不强制。由他自去。</p>
<p>我們團部自上海初立時。本是前赴黑龍江奔馬將軍那處効力去的。惟今關外旦夕危急。半壁河山。行將燼滅。經全體議决。都贊成援急爲主。故改日内誓師出關。和錦西義軍通力合作。</p>

<p>第三回瑜亮同來竟使筵席易散尹邢相避不知鈿盒誰遺</p>
<p>你此刻家破親亡。孑然一身。往後便要自己擔負自己的責任了。想勉强維持到畢了業。經濟上己是發生了問題。說不定你那堂叔安大奎。肯不肯盡必盡力的照顧。若是再出什麽錯兒·只怕你目前就有些不好過。就是撑持到畢業了。單槍獨馬。要在這社會中尋職業·討生活。人情是這麽勢利。世態是這麽炎凉。以你這樣一個無援無助的靑年。要想獲得美滿的勝利。建立偉大的事業。期以興家復産。名利俱收。怕不是很容易的事。前路茫茫。隨時隨地都得要費一番莫大的氣力。庶幾才有一線的希望。倒眞要很難爲你呢。至於我這方面。原本比你還不如。環境的惡劣。是蔑以復加。家庭中的苦痛。也較誰爲甚。雖說家父幸還健在。照眼前說不似你那麽孤苦。然而你深知道我的事。我這父親是靠不住的。雖有亦若無的。我自小兒就没有娘。家父又那樣頑固腐舊。待我無恩。只曉得守著我那幾個尖酸刻薄的姨娘。過他們的快樂日子。絶没曾把我這苦命的女兒。放在心上。是我在家裏受不了伊們的氣。幾經要求。又托了許多親友勸說。才勉强讓我到北京來上學。一年中在外邊的用費。要像討爛賬的一般。費許多唇舌。寫無數書信。經過來來往往好幾回的討價還價。方多多少少零零碎碎隨便寄給我一些。由我苦刻扣的對付著過。新近家父還有信來說。這一向他在那縣知事的任上。事情也不大好。百姓們刁得很。什麽正項錢糧稅捐。都不肯痛快的十足繳納。省城裏的上司。偏又一封封急電來要提欵加捐。急加星火。怕這個位置將來遲早要不能保。囑咐我少向家裏寫信要錢。能省則省一些。不能省則請你自己在外面憑本事去找錢用。不能再多指望家裏了你想。他們就再爲難些。何至於缺少我這一點讀書的費用就拿不出。呌我自己另我找錢。那更是寄談。我一個未畢業的女學生。那裏有憑本事找錢的法子。本來家父根本就不贊成女孩唸書。所以肯送我上北京來。無非是爲了姨娘們要拔去我這個眼中釘。一送出了門。自角他們就不愛多管了。幸而我在此地過見了你。彼此志同道合。意見相投。謀一種互助的結合。纔使我不致於十分絶望。不想命運終還是這般的惡劣。你如今又遭了這個意外的變故。眼見得於我們那種結合。是來了個大大的打擊。雖說同病相憐。患難相顧。我這個人對你。决不會有什含糊。也不至於就分氣沮。祇是我歷苦己多。自知命薄。深恐怕這不是好兆騐。來日大難。還不知倒霉到什麽地步呢。說罷。悲從中來。竟眼淚汪汪的朝著安玉田哭起來了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刋中華民國二十一年一月二十八日星期四（不另取資）小論壇借死人出風頭（幸）靜安寺路上的某「公館」門前，大槪是因爲「老爺」或「太太」之類有個把「羽化登仙」了，所以用萬千只亮晶晶的電燈紮成一個牌樓，一到晚上，便萬燈齊明，照耀得如同白畫一樣。當然這是爲了要顯示他們貴府的闊綽，換言之，即是拉死架子，借死人裝活人的門面。聽說從前盛宣懷死後大出喪，鬨動了好幾十萬人都趕來上海看熱鬧。不久以前永安公司總經理郭標出喪，我雖没曾親眼看見，但據一般輿論批評，似乎也還「嘸啥。」中國人的一舉一動，似乎都是做給人家「看」的，從盛宣懷郭標大出喪以至靜安寺某公館門前的電燈牌樓，其用意當亦不外乎「給人家看。」「給人家看」這裏面還含有很深的哲學··第一表·示他們貴府是多麽「闊，」第二·表示他們自己對於他們的「顯考」「顯妣」是多麽「孝，」第三·表示他們底「顯考」「顯妣」是多麽生「榮」而死亦「哀。」據說有許多闊綽的公館裏死了「老爺」或「太太，」所謂孝子賢孫也者，哭不出而且也不高興哭，便僱請許多以哭爲職業的專家代哭，哭而請「代，」其理由正亦不外首給「聽」與給人「看。」實在這樣一做，死人活人，都出了風頭，而不爲者，是不智也。電燈裝門面，亦即智者之智舉也，也許，這便是中國的「國粹。」「智」與」不智，」「國粹」或「非國粹，」我們且暫擱着不提，不過我總覺得安迪生先發明電燈，並不是爲着要使我們有以顯闊綽，裝門面。萬千只的電燈用之於毫無意識的浪費，我想，安迪先生生在九泉之下，也當極口呼寃。大衆文藝做崇文做人就該做，要做自己做，不會做要學做，學會做就去做·做不熟常常做，做不好改良做，想着做就去做，應當做就去做，窮時果然要做，富時更其要做，不要因困難而不做，不要因無助而不做，由困難做到容易，由麻煩做到簡單，從頭做到底，從早做到晚，從小做到大，從大做到老，越做越有趣，愈做愈進步，做！做！做！做到閻王呌去，才不做，大衆科學鉛筆之造成陶宏鉛筆所有的鉛，並不是現在所謂之鉛。西曆一五六四年英國發現了一種比鉛軟而黑的礦物，最初呌做黑鉛。現在的鉛筆便是這種東西造的，所以呌做鉛筆。其實這種東西在中國晋朝約在公元四百年就有人拿來寫字，或是畫眉。黑鉛現在呌做石墨Ｃｒａｐｂｉｔｅ和煤似的散佈在地下，世界著名産石墨的地點有美國，坎拿大，錫南，巴維利亞Ｂａｖａｒｉａ等處·，中國則有綏遠歸化，察哈爾，河南，河北，江蘇，安徽等地出産。石墨和煤是同類，都是由炭素所構成的。牠而且還是煤的哥哥呢！因爲煤在地下埋藏的時間越久，質料就越純粹，到了差不多完全由炭素組成没有一點雜質的東西時，便成了石黑。造鉛筆所用的木頭多半是紅杉樹木，也有用紙來代替的。將這種木頭截成和平常的鉛筆一半厚，六市寸長，夠切六隻鉛筆那樣寛。用機器將他們平均的刻六條溝！溝祇石墨條的一半深淺，然後將兩塊有溝的木片膠合起來，將開採出來的石墨，黏土和水所成的膏狀混合物，灌進溝中。乾了以後，用機器將他們分爲六枝鉛筆。鉛筆有硬鉛與軟鉛二種。這是混合物中黏土放得多少的關係。黏土放得多成硬銅··極軟的黑鉛筆黏土祇放一點，或是再加點燈炱更黑。有色鉛筆是用黏土，白堊或是臘和有色物質的混合物，參到石墨裏面去。代替黏土的東西是臘和牛油的混合物，有名的ａｒｐｅｎｔｅｒ軟鉛筆便是以這種混合物加到石墨裏面去，所造成的。以上係節譯ＴｈｅＳｃｉｅｎｃｅｏｆＴｂｉｎｐｓＡｂｏｕｔｕｓＰ·１２１３石墨除去可造鉛筆外，還可製造電極和坩堝，因爲石墨最難溶解和蒸發。塗在鐵上面可以防銹，塗在器械之運轉部以减摩擦。所以石墨在工業上佔有很重要的位置『註』近來工業上製造石墨是將煤與沙放在長約四十尺的大電爐中經過高熱後，煤即變成石墨。街頭社會學路上的三種露天招待警愚在ＸＸ游戲塲的轉角上，折而向東，沿着馬路慢慢地走去，就可見到這三種所謂露天招待，只聽見鼓其如簧之舌，拚命地招徠主顧的一片聲浪。你如果是初出茅廬的雛兒，或是才到上海的客人，正在要想涉足桃源，而恨無從問津的，碰到了這種毛遂自薦的露天招待，那自然是情弗自禁，到後來也許弄得墮入岐途，執迷不反，馴至喪失人格，犧牲生命的，也所在而有。所以這種露天招待，簡直是製造罪惡的機械，擾亂社會的魔鬼。現在把它們招徠主顧時慣用的一種語調，依樣葫蘆地依次寫在下面，好使一般初出茅廬及才來海上的朋友看了，加以注意！第一種「喂！朋友！有要走，來　！奴來搭倷做個媒人。倷看格位小姐生得阿標緻？中意弗中意？怩搭塲化房間交關大·交關淸爽，招呼也交關週到。倷如果有意思，奴就搭倷做媒，攀個相好，倷看阿好？」第二種先生··阿要開個房間？呌隻寡老來白相相？該搭有幾隻寡老，生得交關漂亮，而且是人家人，我馬上喊得來，可以隨你揀，只消幾塊洋鈿，就可同你窩心。該搭房間蠻寛敝，床舖也乾凈，你跟我到裏面來，我把房間開開來，先領你看看。第三種老班··阿要抽烟？此地Ｘ家新開出來，地方極淸爽，貨色頂乖乖，「烘膏」「冷籠」都有，賣得也便宜。你去試試看，包你呌好」。上述三種的露天招待，第一種算是普通的，在其它租界的馬路上，尚屬數見不鮮。屬於二三兩種，可稱走徧滬濱，絶無僅有。至於這三種露天招待，究屬何種營業？它的活動區域，是在那條馬路？想讀者都是聰明人，總能意會得到吧！東南西北浴室中的恐怖影呆那是去年廢歷十二月裏的一個晚上吧，我到隣近的一個浴室裏面去洗浴，這個浴室，在二三年前，我是常去的，但後來却己好久不去了。不料這一天走進去，幾個堂倌，和平常的態度不同，都笑嘻嘻地來奉承我，裏面有一個，似乎面熟的，待我格外討好。平時洗浴，祇泡一壺茶，但這一天却另外添上了一黄籃橘子，一小荷包橄欖。我也知道的，一到了歲尾年頭，一般的浴室，茶館，戲館，剃頭店等等，對於熟客都要有相當的表示！打抽豐！但在我的意料之中，以爲時候還早，祇有十二月的初旬，而且我好久没有到那邊去洗浴了，根本不能認爲熟客，那知承蒙不棄，竟叨堂倌先生格外優待起來，這眞是受寵若驚呢·我看見了橄欖和橘子，便發生了一個困難的問題，就是我一向到浴室裏洗浴，是不多帶錢的。那一天身上祇帶了幾角錢，因此，恐怖的心理，便突然刺進了我的心窩。逃出去嗎，不好意思，浴嗎，没有錢給他們打抽豐，進退兩難，前後總免不了要丢一下臉子。因此使我一時竟無法解决，終於由恐怖而顫懔了。在腦海中徘徊了好久，結果，被我想着了天無絶人之路，皮夾之中，那天有位朋友給我一元藥水洋錢，託我到書局中去代用的，大槪一塊錢茶錢，六角錢擦背，六角錢小賬，總是夠了。但我回頭一看，一籃橘子，一包橄欖，買價也許要七八角錢，上海的生活程度是如何地高，這一塊錢也許不夠，給得少一些，是要遭他們白眼的，依舊使得我狐疑莫决。結果終於被我看見一個洗浴者，給他們一塊錢茶錢，橘子橄欖，依然放在榻上。我才知道這些禮物，可以留下的，如果拿了去，非給兩元不可，於是我也依樣給了一塊錢茶錢。六角擦背。六角小賬。那知這些人。眼睛白白地。連謝都不謝。我當然知道是給得太少了，我走了以後，他們或許還要駡我，但我的皮夾，却己空了。眞是要寫意反受氣。這是我初次得了一個敎訓。上海故事上海故事（一二）周容編譯·第四章修訂土地章程Ｘ咸豐四年租界章程上海租界成立之後，外人之勢力日漸擴張，淸廷官吏旣無能力過問租界以内事，租界内之外人遂乘機實行攫起警察行政以及司法等權。於是英領阿利國·美領麥菲（ＲＣＭｕｒｐｂｙ），法領亞當（Ｂ·Ｅｄａｎ），會同擬訂洋涇浜以北租界章程，此種章程擬定後始起得上海道之同意，上海道事前旣未與聞，事後不過劃諾照辦而己。Ｘ租地人會議一八五四年七月十一日，英法美三國領事遂於英領事館召集租地人會議，通過三領事所擬之洋涇浜以北租界新章程。於是解散領事所委派之碼頭街道公會，另行推選委員，組織工部局，以管理租界内之外僑一切事務，於是分立之英美法三租界，此時有一度之併合，而租界内今日之工部局之組織，即始於此，查此次所訂章程，類多沿襲道光二十五原訂章程條文，但此次所特别規定者，即土地之取得與登記，須均先向各該國領事請求，如遇該國尚未派駐滬領事時，則向其他友邦領事請求，這種條文包含有英國官吏放棄其昔日獨佔租界内一切行政之思想矣。市塲訊玲瓏圖畫雜誌來函電影爲第八藝術國人對之極感興趣「攝影畫報」及「玲瓏圖畫雜誌」有鑒及此特依歐美成例聯合舉行「中外電影明星選舉大會」實爲中國空前第一次之創舉完全公開選舉票登於報上特集合全國銀幕同志之公意自去年十一月十五日起至本月十五日止共收到選舉票九萬八千一百二十四張是可見國人對於電影狂熱之一般但此次阮玲玉與胡蝶之票數相差僅五十票依比例則相差及毫厘經開票委員再三考慮認各有擅長遂定兩人合得「電影皇后」之尊稱敬告投稿諸君籟君先生大鑒昨接馮寳羊先生來函，希示知爲荷，來書如下··「本月二十二日貴刋大衆科學欄内，載有籟君之「玻璃上刻字畫的一法」一段，内中所用之「銀石粉」與「酸粉」三藥，謂係西藥店購來，但鄙人遍向各處詢購，均答無此物品，故特函懇執事，或轉詢籟君，將詳細名詞示知，如能附註西名，則爲更妙，」</p>

<p>The League of Nations Strives to Alleviate the Shanghai Situation</p>
<p>Secret Meeting Discusses Warning the Japanese Government</p>
<p>Chairman Urges Chinese and Japanese Representatives Regarding the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>Public Meeting Postponed to Thursday</p>
<h3 id="e2">League of Nations Administrative Council Holds Secret Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council held a secret meeting today. Neither the Chinese nor Japanese representatives attended. They discussed whether to send a strong warning to the Japanese government, opposing the continued advance of the Japanese navy towards Shanghai. It is said that after receiving concrete information from Shanghai proving that this action is feasible, the Council will send this warning to the Japanese government. When the Council met on Monday to re-discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute over the Liaoning case, it was decided to hold a public meeting on Wednesday, but it has now been postponed to Thursday to await the results of private negotiations on the Manchurian issue. Public attention here is now focused on the situation in Shanghai. Chinese representative Dr. Yen Hui-ching and Japanese representative Sato are reporting news to the Council at any time. Secret discussions of the Sino-Japanese dispute are currently underway, but the authorities have not yet made any announcements. They are still awaiting further telegrams from the Guomindang government in Nanjing. It is also reported that the representatives of the Council have all requested new instructions from their respective governments. If the Council decides to send a strong warning to the Japanese government, what will be the basis for it? No news has been released. The Council is currently facing obstacles because the investigation committee will not be able to reach the Far East for two months. (National News Agency telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) During the secret meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council last night, Chairman Paul Hymans, Secretary-General Sir Eric Drummond, and the representatives of Britain, Germany, and Italy first met with Japanese representative Sato, and then with Chinese representative Dr. Yen Hui-ching. It is said that Hymans made alarming remarks regarding the current situation in Shanghai and the necessity of preventing the expansion of the conflict. He also inquired about the latest news on the matter from the Japanese representative. The Japanese representative presented several telegrams, indicating that the situation had improved slightly, but the Japanese representative claimed that the organizations boycotting Japanese goods were concentrated in Shanghai. Japan is determined to protect the interests of its citizens but is also very willing to avoid the expansion of the dispute, especially to avoid interfering with the interests of other countries in Shanghai. The number of Japanese troops who have actually landed is only one-third of the British troops stationed in Shanghai, he claimed. Hymans asked Sato whether he would be willing to issue a comforting declaration at the public meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Sato replied that he had already made far-reaching remarks at the public meeting on Monday, but he did not object in principle to repeating the remarks he had already made yesterday. Hymans stated that the Administrative Council did not want to study events prior to December 10, as the Administrative Council had already studied them in previous meetings. The Administrative Council is currently most concerned about the status of Shanghai, he said. According to last night's announcement, another secret meeting of the Administrative Council will be held at 4:00 PM today, and neither the Chinese nor Japanese representatives will attend. (Reuters telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Reuters has learned from responsible sources that the rumor that the League of Nations Administrative Council has decided to issue a warning to Japan regarding Japan's intended actions in Shanghai is not true. The Administrative Council has only had Chairman Paul Hymans advise both sides not to act rashly. This method was decided after the members of the Administrative Council met with the Chinese and Japanese representatives separately today. This morning, the Administrative Council handled other business and did not raise the Manchurian issue at the public meeting. The issues handled by the Administrative Council were mostly related to intellectual cooperation, education, photography, loan unification, etc. The meeting proceeded quickly, exceeding the planned agenda, so the meeting originally scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed to January 28. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) During the conversation between the representatives of the investigation committee and the Japanese representative Sato last night, some suggested that the representative be asked to issue a declaration at the next public meeting of the Administrative Council, officially acknowledging the open-door policy in Manchuria, as stated in the country's reply to the U.S. note. In addition, Japan should also clearly state that it will respect the various principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant. It is difficult to achieve all of these goals, and the manner in which the declaration will be issued is being continuously negotiated. The Administrative Council seems to have agreed to seek to pass a new resolution at this meeting. Although the Japanese have repeatedly declared that satisfactory results have already been given, they may still agree to the above-mentioned opinions in the future. According to a certain Japanese declaration, the point of greatest concern to the Tokyo government is to prevent the anti-Japanese movement, which seems to be centered in Shanghai. (Havas telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to comments made by League of Nations insiders this morning regarding the secret meeting of the Council and the tone of the conversation between Council Chairman Paul Hymans and the chief representatives of China and Japan, if China invokes Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to deal with the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Council will oppose it. It is said that Hymans stated during separate conversations with the chief representatives of China and Japan yesterday that the majority of Council members are absolutely opposed to invoking Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, because the Council must receive the report of the investigation committee before it can proceed with anything. The investigation committee will not be able to start work before April, so it is difficult to expect concrete action before the Council meeting in May. At the same time, Dr. Yen Hui-ching and Sato both said that they intended to ask their respective governments not to take any actions that would aggravate the situation in China, especially in Shanghai. The Shanghai incident is the focus of attention here today, so the Council is now working to alleviate the situation in Shanghai. The attitude of the United States is referred to here as an ominous sign. However, it is said that the Council is also preparing to send a strong warning directly to China and Japan to prevent the situation from becoming more serious. Hymans has been pushed to draft this document, and after it is approved at the public meeting on Thursday, it will be sent separately to China and Japan. However, before Thursday, although there will be behind-the-scenes negotiations, everything will be left unattended. (National News Agency telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Note Has Been Delivered to London</p>
<p>On One Hand, Remind China to Be Aware of the Current Danger</p>
<p>On the Other Hand, Prevent Japan from Implementing a Blockade Policy</p>
<p>London has learned from very reliable sources that yesterday the U.S. government conveyed its views on the status of Shanghai in a note to British Ambassador to Washington Sir Ronald Lindsay. The Ambassador immediately telegraphed it to London. The British cabinet is now earnestly considering it. The issue is still under study, so the government's opinion cannot be ascertained. The content of the U.S. note has not been released, so the nature of the British reply cannot be predicted either. The reply will be constrained by the very complex reasons of international policy and the interests of the British community in Shanghai. The authorities have formally denied that the government sent a note to Japan. (Reuters telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>New York American officials are closely watching developments in Shanghai. Yesterday, President Hoover and the cabinet discussed the matter, followed by a meeting with Secretary of State Stimson. Stimson's policy has so far been conciliatory, but it is now said that his policy can be described as "determined to maintain American rights." According to the New York Tribune, the State Department is now expected to suggest to Britain that they take joint action on a common front when necessary. The newspaper also said that the State Department has issued instructions to the Consul General in Shanghai, roughly involving the State Department's attitude, that Japan's armed interference in the International Settlement cannot be condoned. (Reuters telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>London The Washington correspondent of The Times reports today that Britain and the United States have the same interests in the Shanghai International Settlement. It remains to be seen whether this can be transformed into cooperative action. Regarding the U.S. note to China and Japan on January 7, this kind of cooperation can be said to be non-existent. However, the Manchurian case and the Shanghai case are clearly very different. The United States has now openly suggested cooperation, and if Britain refuses, it will leave the United States unable to understand why. The correspondent also said that according to reliable sources, Washington is willing to take consistent diplomatic action with Britain, that is, on the one hand, to remind China to be aware of the potential dangers, and on the other hand, to prevent Japan from taking the opportunity to carry out blockade actions. As for Washington's emphasis on London's decisions, it goes without saying. (Reuters telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>London The Daily Telegraph reports that, according to U.S. news yesterday, Britain had sent a note to Japan regarding the Shanghai situation, but this has been firmly denied by official circles here. The British government cannot help but be anxious about the Shanghai situation, but it has not yet raised any negotiations with Japan. According to general opinion, the International Settlement must be respected by Japan. If China and Japan clash, and Japanese troops occupy certain locations in the Chinese territory, Britain would not be in a position to protest, because since 1927, foreign troops have also engaged in similar behavior.

<p>Shanghai Is Like a Powder Keg, Ready to Explode at Any Time</p>
<p>The Situation Is Becoming More Dangerous Day by Day, and the League of Nations Cannot Shirk Its Responsibility</p>
<p>London This morning, The Evening Standard publishes an article by former North-China Daily News editor Green, entitled "The Shanghai Calamity." This article is printed on the front page, occupying four columns, and is attracting much attention. According to Green, the landing of Japanese troops in Shanghai has caused all countries in the world to pay direct attention to the conflict between China and Japan. This action by Japan will lead to the collapse of the Chinese government, arouse a communist trend throughout the country, and may even lead to a war between the United States and Japan. Shanghai is like a box loaded with flammable materials. Although most of the million Chinese in the foreign concessions are peaceful and orderly merchants, they also contain extremely violent elements. Their anger at Japan's actions has now reached the boiling point. The Chinese government is almost bankrupt at this time. If the army has no pay, the crisis will be very serious, because the soldiers will inevitably be used by the Communists. Now the Communists in China have risen like a prairie fire. It is not difficult for Japan to occupy the Chinese government offices, arsenals, airfields, and barracks in Greater Shanghai. Can the great powers sit idly by and remain indifferent at that time? (Reuters telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>London The Evening Standard also has an editorial this morning that draws attention to the seriousness of the situation in Shanghai, saying that Shanghai is an international city with a population of three million, including Chinese soldiers who are not well-disciplined and Chinese students who are fanatical and disorderly. If foreign troops occupy it, there is fear that extremely horrific tragedies will occur, and the outcome is unpredictable. What the Japanese call the Washington threat is actually a warning to show what kind of reaction will occur if Japan's interference in China does not stop. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>London The Manchester Guardian today published an editorial stating that protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents in Shanghai is a very important responsibility, and it is not known how to avoid interfering in the International Settlement. It also stated that the League of Nations Administrative Council is now holding another secret meeting, hoping to persuade Japan not to expand the current situation, and to persuade China not to take any further action, so as to await the report of the League of Nations investigation committee. It is feared that Major General Shiozawa will still take positive action, completely disregarding the situation in Geneva and the unpredictable consequences. (Reuters telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German conservative newspaper Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung is extremely worried about the emergency situation in Shanghai. The newspaper is quite concerned about the communist riots that will occur in China. The Allgemeine Zeitung said that China's internal consolidation has repeatedly been hit by external blows and cannot be established. Now Japan wants to occupy Chinese territory in Shanghai, and the internal disorder in China will become even more unmanageable. The world economy will have no hope of recovery, and it is only natural that communists will take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rise up against the current government. If Japan once implements its intimidation and occupies Zhabei and other Chinese areas, and the Chinese army rises up to resist, then the International Settlement and the French Concession will also undergo unpredictable changes, and the danger of its future is beyond the control of the countries involved. The Allgemeine Zeitung strongly criticized the League of Nations' inability to deal with the dispute between China and Japan, saying that if the Council has to wait for the report of the investigation team before it can resolve the Manchurian case, then the situation will become more dangerous day by day, and there will be no hope of resolution. The changes that are taking place in China and in Shanghai are gradually developing. This may reduce the confidence of people around the world in the international unity's ability to eliminate war. If the Japanese army once occupies Shanghai in China, and at a time when the disarmament conference is about to open, it will especially prompt the world to realize the future of disarmament.

<h3 id="e16">Summoning a National Crisis Conference for Deliberation (Part 1) by Bin <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>What Constitutes a "National Crisis" and How to Address It?</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident and the subsequent peaceful Nanking-Canton Agreement, the notion of "uniting the nation's strength to overcome the national crisis" has gained significant momentum. Wang Jingwei once proposed organizing a National Crisis and National Salvation Conference, and Sun Ke also advocated convening a People's Representative Conference. The declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee further explicitly declared to the nation the determination to "immediately convene a National Crisis Conference and a National Salvation Conference to determine the fundamental principles for national salvation." Now, the National Crisis Conference has been officially decided by the Executive Yuan, with special commissioners appointed to prepare and members hired, and the meeting schedule confirmed. In this precarious situation, gathering the nation's talents in one place to jointly discuss the fundamental principles of national salvation is deemed necessary and a good intention. What more can we say about this?</p>
<p>However, this matter is of great importance and not a trivial matter. If the conference is to determine the fundamental principles for national salvation, then this conference will be the key to our nation's survival. Upon careful consideration, we feel there are several questions that need to be raised with the government authorities.</p>
<p>The conference is called a "National Crisis" conference, so, as the name implies, it should be understood that the convocation of this meeting is specifically to save the nation from its crisis.</p>
<p>However, "national crisis" has now become an extremely common yet ambiguous term. It can be said to refer specifically to foreign aggression, or it can be said to refer specifically to "floods" or "banditry." We believe that the meaning of this term must be clearly defined before the conference can avoid becoming aimless. In other words, we must first recognize what constitutes a national crisis before we can speak of "how to cope with the national crisis" or "how to overcome the national crisis." Granted, the loss of the Northeast and the increasing urgency of foreign aggression are indeed major crises facing our country. However, apart from foreign aggression, are the hunger and cold of the disaster victims and the desolation of the disaster areas not also national crises? Are the stagnation of education, the bankruptcy of finances, the decline of industry, and the overall chaos of politics, verging on a state of anarchy, not also national crises? Will the purpose of convening the National Crisis Conference today be solely to deal with diplomatic issues, or will domestic affairs also be discussed simultaneously? We believe that without internal chaos, there would be no external aggression. At the same time, if the government is clean and politics are sound, if political organizations are healthy, and if those in power can prioritize the interests of the nation and the people and fulfill their responsibilities, then internal affairs will not be chaotic. Therefore, the so-called national crisis today should not be regarded as referring exclusively to foreign aggression but rather as emphasizing domestic affairs. Defending against aggression and protecting our territory are the exclusive responsibility of the government, which should exert all its efforts to do so. There is no room for discussion, and therefore no need to convene a National Crisis Conference. In the peace conference and the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, more emphasis was placed on discussions of political systems and the distribution of positions, while diplomatic issues were rarely discussed. From this, it can be seen that the government's so-called national crisis does not refer exclusively to diplomacy but rather emphasizes domestic difficulties. Is this the case or not? We cannot be sure. This is one point.</p>
<p>The members have already been hired, and the meeting schedule has also been confirmed, but what is the nature of this conference and what are its responsibilities? The government has not made a clear announcement, and we are indeed doubtful and perplexed, unable to guess. According to the declaration of the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the purpose of the National Crisis Conference and the National Salvation Conference is twofold: first, to concentrate the plans of national experts to form a complete preparation; and second, to concentrate the opinions of the people to form a complete expression... to recover our territory and preserve our sovereignty. Furthermore, according to the decree issued by the National Government on January 19 regarding the convening of the National Crisis Conference:</p>
<p>"To this day, domestic troubles have barely subsided while foreign aggression is growing. All our countrymen should sharpen their spirits and jointly resist aggression... each with a sincere desire to save the country, jointly seek ways of self-defense, and with one heart and one mind, overcome this difficult situation." Furthermore, according to the letter of appointment issued by the National Government to the members of the National Crisis Conference: "Recently, due to the rampant foreign aggression and the increasing urgency of invasion... the government, fearing the collapse of the dilapidated building and hoping to navigate the great river together, seeks to relieve the national crisis and invites virtuous men to assist." Thus, the purpose of convening the National Crisis Conference should be specifically to "recover our territory and preserve our sovereignty," and to "seek ways of self-defense with a sincere desire to save the country." In other words, the "responsibility" of the National Crisis Conference is specifically to "devise self-defense." Apart from self-defense, other matters are beyond its purview. In this case, the "responsibility" of the National Crisis Conference is indeed minimal. National affairs can be monopolized by a few individuals, and the people cannot interfere. When the nation faces foreign aggression, it is pushed to the people. Is it reasonable to say that in today's situation, considering the domestic situation, which is a mess, is education not worth maintaining? Is finance not worth reorganizing? Should the military dictatorship and the machinations of politicians not be curtailed? Are all domestic affairs not in urgent need of rectification? Should the people trapped in misery not be rescued immediately? And are we limited only to upholding our sovereign rights in foreign affairs and having the people resist foreign aggression? Is the convocation of the National Crisis Conference only for this? Secondly, any organization must have a legal basis and must have its authority defined. What exactly is the National Crisis Conference today? Is it a people's organization or part of an overall political organization? Is it a temporary organization or a permanent organization? Is it merely a consultative conference or a legislative or executive conference? Does its resolution have the power to bind the government? All of this is a mystery. Recently, a certain member of the Central Committee said, "The National Crisis Conference is neither a legislative body nor an executive body. It only discusses solutions for the Central Government to refer to. In the past, one party monopolized power, and other forces were not allowed to participate in political work. Now that the national crisis is urgent, we have to broaden the channels of communication so that talents outside the party can also have an opportunity to participate in politics." If this is the case, then the National Crisis Conference has no authority to speak of. Gathering hundreds of people for discussion and reaching a resolution to be submitted to the government, which will adopt it if it deems it acceptable and discard it if it deems it unacceptable. On the other hand, it is just like using candy to deceive children, as if to say that the government has now given the people an opportunity to participate in politics and has broadened the channels of communication. It has only a name without substance, only form without power. This is to perfunctorily treat and deceive the people. The nation is in such a crisis, and the government still dares to perfunctorily treat and deceive the people? We dare not and cannot believe it. Is this the case or not? This is another point.</p>

<h3 id="e20">The Content of Our Country's Proposal Drafted by Chen Youren <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Nanking) The Council of the League of Nations has already met on the 25th. The attitude of our country's representative at this meeting is highly noteworthy. It is said that the chief representative, Yan Huiqing, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 11th of this month to ask for strategies. Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Youren telegraphed Representative Yan on the 24th, and his instructions contained an outline of the government's policy at the meeting. Since this outline has not been formally approved by the Central Political Council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not formally published it. The reporter had a conversation with a certain gentleman from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and learned the general content as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Our country's representative will reiterate in the meeting that the Chinese government has complied with the resolutions of the Council of the League of Nations on September 30, October 24, and December 10 of the previous year. The Chinese government especially welcomes the resolution of December 10 to send an investigation team to China.</p>
<p>2.  Our country's representative will solemnly declare the following four points: Since the Council of the League of Nations resolved to establish the investigation team on December 10, Japan (A) forcibly occupied Jinzhou, the last location of the Liaoning Provincial Government, by force. The US government's note to China and Japan stated that the recent military action in Jinzhou had completely destroyed the administrative authority of the Republic of China in South Manchuria that remained before September 18. This was issued because of this act of war by Japan. (B) Japan not only did not comply with the resolution of the Council of the League of Nations to withdraw its troops to the area adjacent to the South Manchuria Railway, but also forced the Chinese government troops to retreat to within Shanhaiguan with military force. Now Japan has occupied the entire territory of the three northeastern provinces by force. (C) The Japanese army has recently attacked the territory of Rehe Province, and its invasion of Chinese territory has actually extended beyond the Manchurian region. (D) Japan's war and military actions against China have not only expanded to the territory of Rehe Province, but also to North China, Central China (such as the intimidation in Shanghai), and Southern China, attempting to (1) coerce China to recognize Japan's annexation of Manchuria and Mongolia, and (2) force the central and local governments of China to ban anti-Japanese patriotic actions.</p>
<p>3.  During the discussion of the agenda, the Chinese representative will propose that the Council of the League of Nations implement the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant and declare that this is the most effective way to correct Japan's breach of the Covenant after dispatching the investigation team.</p>
<p>The instructions also said to Representative Yan that the gist of the third proposal is to create a new situation and opportunity. Whether or not it is passed by the League of Nations, it can at least enable our country to convene an international conference to resolve the Manchurian issue based on the Washington Nine-Power Treaty or the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Moreover, this proposal is complementary to breaking off diplomatic relations with Japan. Breaking off diplomatic relations does not completely destroy the relationship between China and Japan to lead to war, but merely suspends diplomatic relations between the two countries to create a new international situation and make it easier to convene an international conference. It is also said that after these instructions were issued, a certain country secretly tried hard to prevent Representative Yan from submitting the third proposal. Former legal advisor to the Chinese Presidential Office, Westel W. Willoughby, also advised Yan, saying that proposing to implement Article 16 of the Covenant would mean the establishment of a state of war, and advised Yan to be cautious. It is also said that a certain party also telegraphed Yan, urging him not to submit Article 16 of the Covenant to avoid rashly starting a war. When the meeting opened on the 25th, Representative Yan's speech on Japan's state of aggression was largely the same as the content of the instructions, except for the proposal, which seems to not have been implemented. In his speech, Representative Yan stated that China is very willing to seek a solution under Article 11 of the Covenant, but the opportunity to invoke other clauses is becoming more urgent day by day. Therefore, it is still unclear whether Representative Yan will submit Article 16 according to the instructions during the discussion, or whether he will adopt Willoughby's advice and continue to submit Article 11.

<p>Devoting Himself to Pacification Affairs</p>
<p>(Nanking) Liu Zhi telegraphed He Yingqin, asking him to forward to the Central Government his request to resign from the position of Chairman of Henan Province and devote himself to pacification affairs. His stated reason was that without the separation of military and civilian affairs, there would be no progress in economic and cultural undertakings, and politics would easily overstep the bounds of normalcy. The Kuomintang called for the overthrow of warlords. If military men are constantly in charge of civil administration, it is tantamount to falling into the trap of warlords. It is said here that Liu's argument is quite enlightened, and if he can realize it in practice, he can be a model for soldiers. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The delegation of petitioners from Zhongshan University arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 27th and sent more than 40 people to see Hu to urge him to go to Nanking. Hu replied that he was unable to go due to illness. Since the Executive Yuan is in charge of government affairs, there is no need for everyone to go. Moreover, Sun is responsible for the cabinet, but he cannot implement the policies of resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists. Zhang is protected even though he lost troops and territory, and Sun has to resign. What can I do if I go to Nanking at this time? A representative said that Sun Yat-sen went north with illness in the 13th year of the Republic of China, why doesn't Mr. follow his example? Hu angrily said, "Today's government is not as good as Duan Qirui's. He did not dare to detain people, but now he actually detains them. Why do you send me into the tiger's mouth?" The representatives left without getting what they wanted. They will go north at 5:00 PM. The Jinda delegation of petitioners will leave the province and return north on the 28th.

<h3 id="e63">Former British Foreign Secretary Henderson Gracefully Goes to Geneva <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Not Giving Up Chairmanship of the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th - Former Foreign Secretary Henderson departed today for Paris, then on to Geneva, to chair the Disarmament Conference, which will open next Monday. He was accompanied by his wife and secretary, Pike. Henderson's chairmanship of the Disarmament Conference is particularly noteworthy as he is neither a government official nor a member of Parliament. When he was Foreign Secretary in the Labour government, the League of Nations invited him to chair the Disarmament Conference. Although he later resigned from the post of Foreign Secretary, he has refused to relinquish the honor of chairing the Disarmament Conference. Despite efforts to persuade him to give it up, he has declined. The issue was raised in Parliament, and both MacDonald and Simon said it was not a matter for the British government to resolve but should be decided by the League of Nations, which had invited him to chair. Naturally, the League of Nations could not withdraw its invitation, and Henderson has thus gracefully departed. It is indeed unusual for someone holding this position to chair one of the world's most important conferences in recent years. Henderson recently suffered from an illness for four months but has now fully recovered.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th - According to an official announcement, the list of the British delegation attending the Geneva Disarmament Conference on February 2nd is as follows: Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, Colonial Secretary Thomas, Secretary of State for War Hailsham, Secretary of State for Air Londonderry, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, and Deputy Representative Lady Astor. The Prime Minister plans to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament on February 2nd before traveling to Geneva.</p>

<p>National News, Paris, 27th - According to reliable sources in this morning's Petit Parisien, the meeting between the British and French Prime Ministers, which was scheduled for the end of next week, has been postponed because a common basis for their discussions could not be found. It is reported that negotiations between the British Finance Minister, Hore-Belisha, and representatives of the French Finance Ministry are continuing unabated, in the hope that a plan to reconcile their differences can be worked out before the Hoover Moratorium expires on June 30th of this year.</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 26th - France is currently making every effort to extend the reparations conference until June 30th, which is just 24 hours away from the expiration of President Hoover's moratorium on debt payments. Since this news came from Paris, German newspapers have each had in-depth discussions on it. It is said that French Prime Minister Laval, Finance Minister Flandin, and British Ambassador to France Lord Tyrrell held a meeting in Paris yesterday, at which the French side made this proposal and, based on the French side's opinion, wanted to use this method to prepare for future negotiations between the French Prime Minister and British Prime Minister MacDonald. The tone of the French newspapers is that if the method advocated by France is adopted, the future reparations conference will have to immediately extend the current moratorium period. After Germany accepts the French proposal, it can only agree to the extension of the moratorium period. However, the extension of the moratorium period is tantamount to continuing to pay the unconditional annuities, a responsibility that Germany cannot continue to shoulder. Currently, the German government has stated that Germany should demand the early opening of the reparations conference so that all issues regarding reparations can be thoroughly considered before the expiration of the Hoover plan. If the French side insists on its own views, Germany can also express its views so that the truth can be revealed to the world.</p>

<p>Havas, London, 27th - According to recent news, the location of the missing submarine M2 has been determined. Two destroyers dragged steel cables across the seabed and encountered an object that blocked the cable, which was determined to be the hull of the submarine. Several light boats have been ordered to proceed to the location with salvage equipment. Currently, the ships are anchored nearby, and a seaplane is flying over the sea for reconnaissance.

<h3 id="e70">Xi Qia Insists on Eliminating Bin County Provincial Government <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Extreme Conditions Proposed at the Harbin Conference</p>
<p>Yushu County Has Been Captured by Ma Xilin</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Jin Wuxuan, the representative sent by Xi Qia to Harbin to negotiate peace, left Harbin for Jilin at 8:00 AM yesterday. Xu Ziping, the representative of the Bin County Provincial Government, also returned to Bin on the same day. Negotiations between Jilin and Bin have thus completely broken down. Previously, Zhang Jinghui invited Cheng Yun to come to Harbin, but Cheng, being occupied, sent Xu Ziping, the Director of Finance, as his representative. Xi Qia's representative, Jin Wuxuan, expressed considerable dissatisfaction with this, believing that Xu had no full authority to resolve the matter. On the evening of the 17th, when the two sides met at the Administrative Chief's Office of the Special Zone, Jin Wuxuan proposed: (1) The Bin County Provincial Government must be abolished immediately and must not be moved elsewhere to be re-established. (2) All tax revenues from Jilin Province must be transferred to Jilin without interception en route. (3) No troops may be mobilized to take hostile actions against Jilin. (4) All military actions must be stopped immediately. (5) The safety of the families of all provincial officials must be guaranteed. Xu Ziping, considering the conditions to be too harsh and inconsistent with Zhang Jinghui's original intention of inviting them to negotiate, excused himself by saying that he needed to consult Cheng Yun and reply after receiving his instructions. The two sides stopped talks the next day. Upon hearing the report, Cheng Yun telegraphed Xu Ziping to cease negotiations and return to Bin County immediately. On the same day, Zhang Jinghui invited Jin Wuxuan alone and tried to persuade him to show some leniency and not be too demanding, but Jin refused, saying that he had received orders from Xi Qia when he came and that compromise was not possible without them. Therefore, Zhang was unable to mediate the situation and allowed the stalemate to continue. Although Jin spent several days in Harbin under the guise of meetings, he secretly contacted the two brigades of Ding Chao and Xing Zhanqing with great effort. Jin had previously served as Ding Chao's chief of staff and was particularly familiar with the middle and lower-ranking officers of Ding's troops, using both incentives and threats to considerable effect. Therefore, although the meeting was unsuccessful when he left Harbin, his activities in the army had already shown results. On the day Jin left Harbin, six generals, including Ding Chao, Li Du, Xing Zhanqing, Su Dechen, Zhang Zuozhou, and Feng Zhanhai, jointly telegraphed Xi Qia, saying that they were willing to submit to his control, but with two conditions: first, each would remain stationed in their original defenses without moving; and second, military expenses would be allocated monthly. Xi Qia has not yet replied to the telegram. These several generals are the pillars of the Bin County Provincial Government. If they are truly absorbed by Xi Qia, the Bin County Provincial Government will have no real strength and will be unable to survive. However, it is heard that Li Du and Feng Zhanhai have remained loyal to the Bin Provincial Government. Li's infantry battalion arrived in Bin County on the 20th to assist Feng's regiment in defending the provincial government. Bin County implemented martial law on the 20th, and the families of all important officials have moved to other counties. Cheng Yun has vowed to survive with the city or perish with the city. On the 19th, Cheng issued a telegram stating that regardless of how Xi Qia may press, he would never abolish the provincial government or move it elsewhere without a clear order from the central government and Zhang Auxiliary Marshal (Zuoxiang). If Xi Qia presses again, he will take appropriate self-defense measures. On the one hand, he also telegraphed Zhang Jinghui, saying that he found it difficult to accept the conditions proposed by Xi Qia's representative and had decided to lead the militia to defend the provincial government, even at the cost of sacrificing everything.</p>
<p>As for the military situation, since negotiations between the two sides broke down, the fighting became more intense. On the morning of the 18th, Ma Xilin's bandit army, along with more than 500 Japanese infantry and artillerymen who had arrived from Changchun, launched a fierce attack on Yushu County Regiment at 6:00 AM. The artillery fire was extremely intense, and the city walls were destroyed. The 25th Brigade of Zhang Zuozhou and the 26th Regiment of Song Wenjun did their best to defend the city, while the militia and police attacked Ma's left flank outside the city. However, due to the intense Japanese artillery fire, they were repulsed several times. At 9:00 AM on the 18th, three Japanese aircraft flew in from the Shulan County area, dropping bombs in the air. Various agencies in the city were destroyed, and order was disrupted. The bandits took the opportunity to loot, and merchants and residents cried and fled in despair. The 25th Brigade, unable to withstand the threat of the Japanese aircraft, was the first to collapse, withdrawing from the east gate and heading towards Wuchang. Song Wenjun's regiment was trapped in the city, with more than half of the soldiers killed or wounded. They only broke through at 10:00 AM and gathered at the Sanchahe station on the East Railway. Li Weicheng, the magistrate of Yushu County, escaped in disguise amidst the chaos, and his whereabouts are unknown. At 8:00 PM on the same day, Ma's troops safely led their forces into the city. After entering the city, the soldiers looted throughout the night until representatives from the Chamber of Commerce pleaded, and Ma Xilin finally ordered a halt. Since the evening of the 19th, Yushu has been under Xi Qia's control, and all news has been blocked. At 10:00 PM on the 19th, a branch of Ma's cavalry, numbering about 600, attacked Dehui. The area had no garrison troops, and the county magistrate ordered the militia and police to resist the bandits 15 li west of the city at Xiadianzi. They engaged in a fierce battle overnight, repelling the bandits at 2:00 AM on the morning of the 20th. However, Ma Xilin has now divided his troops into four directions: one branch harassing Sanchahe on the Dongtie-Hachang Line, another harassing Taolaizhao on the Hachang Line, and the majority moving towards Dehui. The county's forces are weak and without supplies, so it will be difficult to defend for long. After Yushu fell, Shuangcheng was only 140 li away, and Japanese aircraft flew over every day for reconnaissance. Panic reigned. On the 19th, Su Dechen, commander of the 22nd Defense Brigade, convened a meeting of local gentry, merchants, and police leaders. The majority advocated resistance. Su immediately sent Zhao's regiment under his command to deploy at Sanchahe, and also deployed his troops in conjunction with the militia around the city. On the 20th, a Japanese aircraft flew for reconnaissance and dropped many leaflets in the name of Yu Shenzheng, giving Su's brigade a deadline to surrender or retreat elsewhere, otherwise a general attack would be launched. Yesterday, it was heard that Yu's cavalry had reached the Hongqitou village south of Shuangcheng, and they will inevitably come into contact with Su's brigade today or tomorrow. Yu Shenzheng's main force, numbering about 10,000, plus several hundred Japanese cavalry and artillery, launched a general attack on Wuchang County on the evening of the 19th. The First Regiment of Xing Zhanqing's brigade stationed there, along with two battalions of Feng Zhanhai's troops and the militia, resisted the enemy together. The fighting was fierce. The Japanese army used three armored vehicles to cover Yu's army and launched several fierce attacks on the east city at 11:00 PM on the 19th, leveling the trenches. Fortunately, Feng's troops resisted with all their might and have not yet been lost. This morning, Ding Chao ordered two infantry battalions under his command to rush to reinforce, and they are expected to arrive tomorrow. Yu's army is now attacking that direction with all its forces, believing that if Wuchang falls, Acheng will be difficult to defend, and the Bin County Provincial Government will lose its shield and cannot exist. Recently, the Acting Chairman of Bin Province, Cheng Yun, has issued a proclamation to the militias of various counties to quickly form volunteer armies to protect the provincial government. Shuangcheng, Acheng, Fuyu, Zhuhe and other counties have replied that they have formed the armies and will listen to orders. (20th)</p>

<p>Harbin City KMT Headquarters Also Sealed</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: At the request of the Japanese side, Zhang Jinghui dismissed Wang Ruihua, the Director of the Special Police Management Office, on the 14th of this month and replaced him with Jin Ronggui. Jin served as the Director of the Special Police Office in the 11th and 16th years of the Republic and still has credibility with the Russian overseas community. Therefore, after he took office, the Russian overseas community ended its violent actions. However, the Japanese side requested the removal of Zang Qifang, Director of the Land Bureau, Zhou Shouyi, Director of the Education Department, and Xu Zhen, Director of the Telephone Bureau, along with Wang Ruihua. Although Zhou and Zang submitted their resignations recently, they were ordered to stay yesterday. Xu, however, was approved for dismissal. At the same time, the city KMT headquarters was ordered to close down, and its former site was occupied by the Harbin Office of the Heilongjiang Army. From now on, all institutions in Harbin will be completely monolithic. Xu Zhen's position, though nominally the Director of the Telephone Bureau, actually controls all wired and wireless long-distance telephones. Today, he held a handover with the new Director, Fan Pei. I visited Mr. Xu, who said that he had come to Harbin to take office as Director of the Telephone Bureau under the orders of the Northeast Transportation Committee, originally hoping to thoroughly reorganize the Harbin telecommunications administration. Unexpectedly, since taking office, he has been running around and has not been able to start the reorganization, as he immediately encountered a period of turmoil. It has been more than four months since the September 18th Incident. In these four months, he has continued to work hard in the original spirit, relying on communication to transmit domestic and foreign news, and therefore incurred resentment. Now, Jin Biedong, the Director of the New Northeast Telecommunications Administration, plans to unify telecommunications administration in the Northeast and has sent two consultants and counselors to Harbin to handle the issue of the Harbin telecommunications administration's affiliation. The reason why he has submitted his resignation is that Director Zhang appreciates him very much and has retained him in this position, but he must be under the command of the New Northeast Telecommunications Administration. If he agrees, there is no problem. However, as he is under the Ministry of the government, he is unable to obey, so he has decided to resign. As for the rumors in the city that Director Zhang dismissed him for administrative convenience, they are purely fictitious. In the future, he will only retire and not ask about current affairs.

<h3 id="e72">Tianjin Tram Fare Increase Uproar <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Citizens Rise Up to Express Opposition</p>
<p>All Tramcars Stop Running for the Entire Day</p>
<p>Pretext Used to Reinforce Troops in the City</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Tianjin Tram and Electric Light Enterprise was established in the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, through a contract signed by the Minister of Beiyang, Yuan Shikai, with the Belgian Consul in Tianjin, Mr. Ga De'er, the Shanghai Yanghang manager, Hai Zha, and the engineer, Sha Te. It was contracted to be managed by Belgian merchants. In November of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, our authorities, citing numerous breaches of contract by the Belgian company, such as extending routes beyond the stipulated limits and engaging in motor power operations, as well as arbitrarily deducting large sums from surplus profits to expand assets and thereby reduce the reported tax amount, lodged a serious protest through the Tianjin Electricity Supervision Office. At that time, it was even planned to take over the tram and electric light company. Subsequently, the consuls-general of Japan, France, and Italy in Tianjin stepped in to mediate, negotiating a peaceful resolution to correct the company's breaches of contract and increase the annual tax revenue to our country. The matter was then settled. Currently, the company's annual surplus profit is approximately four to five million yuan. Last year, Tianjin experienced two incidents, during which the company suspended tram service for over ten days, resulting in losses of tens of thousands of yuan. The company suddenly proposed compensating for these losses, and on January 1st of this year, without the consent of the municipal government, unilaterally increased the fare by two copper coins per ticket. Tianjin merchants and residents, citing the post-turmoil period and the economic hardship of the people, particularly the lower and middle classes who rely on tram travel, expressed strong opposition. The first to propose this opposition were the district chiefs of all eight autonomous districts in the city. Subsequently, workers from various labor unions also recognized that the tram fare increase would significantly impact workers' transportation costs. They organized "Committees Against the Tram Fare Increase" and formed a 150-member picket team. Each day, they went to various tram lines to deliver speeches, urging passengers not to buy tickets until the tram fare increase issue was resolved. Simultaneously, they requested the municipal government to severely reprimand the company and stop the fare increase to protect the people's livelihood. Acting Mayor Zhou Longguang immediately, based on public opinion, instructed the company to cancel the fare increase and await review. However, the company's attitude was extremely rigid, ignoring the instruction. They claimed that the fare increase was based on the contract and did not violate it, requesting the Chinese side to abide by the agreement (as the contract stipulated the possibility of increasing the fare to five cents). The municipal government, however, maintained that this public utility concerned the livelihood of all citizens and that, regardless of the contract's stipulations, prior consent from the local government should have been obtained. The fare increase was implemented without municipal government approval, constituting a serious procedural error and therefore being illegal. There was no room for negotiation unless the fare increase was first canceled. Subsequently, the company requested the Belgian Consul in Tianjin to repeatedly negotiate with Wang Shuchang, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, and Zhang Xueliang, Director of the Peiping Pacification Office, to approve the fare increase. For over twenty days, the matter remained unresolved due to strong public sentiment. Consequently, the picket team's dispatch led the tram company to order the trams to stop running. Once the picket team withdrew, the trams would resume service. Thus, in recent days, tram service in the Chinese district has been intermittent, causing great hardship to the citizens. The other day, a conflict arose between the picket team of the Committee Against the Fare Increase and the tram ticket seller, Liu Ruirong. The picket team severely beat Liu Ruirong and slightly injured dozens of others. The tram workers, totaling over six hundred, seeing that they could not perform their duties and that operating in the Chinese district posed a constant danger, decided to unanimously strike yesterday morning, completely halting all tram services in the city. Simultaneously, they presented five demands to the labor union, including punishing the picket team and ensuring the safety of tram workers. However, the citizens, unaware of the true situation and amidst this period of unsettled nerves, became increasingly suspicious. As for the situation in the city, due to transportation disruptions, pedestrian traffic was extremely congested. The Japanese Consul also expressed concerns about the security of the Japanese concession, repeatedly inquiring about the situation to the municipal government, stating that the tram stoppage greatly affected the Japanese district and that, if necessary, troops would be deployed at the northern end of Asahi Street to maintain order. The municipal government, realizing the gravity of the situation, dispatched Secretary Lü Jin to negotiate with the tram labor union, requesting the immediate restoration of transportation. The labor union then presented seven demands for the municipal government to fulfill. If the municipal government agreed to implement them, work would resume immediately: (1) Requesting the municipal government to promptly resolve the tram fare increase issue; (2) Immediately apprehending Liu Butong, the instigator who incited the picket team to beat the workers; (3) Dissolving the picket team, which, under the guise of opposing the tram fare increase, was actually disrupting local security, and arresting its leaders, Ding Yutian, Li Jingshan, He Xiqian, Zhang Zhongqi, and Shen Hongrun; (4) Confiscating the murderous weapons stored within the municipal party headquarters; (5) Strictly ordering the Public Security Bureau to dispatch a team to be permanently stationed at the picket team's office to monitor the picket team's regrouping; (6) Ordering Liu Butong to compensate the injured workers for medical expenses and all losses; (7) Reserving the right to prosecute Liu Butong for his criminal liability. Representative Lü expressed acceptance. At 5:30 PM, labor union directors Chen Zelin and Zhang Guangxing reported the results of the negotiations with the municipal government to the workers. The workers, considering the urgency of the external diplomatic situation, agreed to resume work first. By about 6:00 PM, all trams in the city were running, and transportation gradually returned to normal. Today, the trams are operating as usual. The labor union has dispatched representatives to the municipal government, requesting the implementation of the proposed seven conditions. Mayor Zhou Longguang personally met with them, stating that within the realm of possibility, he would implement them immediately and ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest the picket team should they regroup. It seems that this fare increase storm can be resolved within days. (January 25th)</p>

<p>Bandits Impersonate Soldiers and Detain Ship There is a ferry service operating between Dongtang Town and Kunshan in this county. In the afternoon the other day, the Jiatan E ship of the Yongli Shipping Bureau was approaching Dongtang Town when over one hundred armed soldiers suddenly arrived at the town carrying guns and claiming that they were under orders to suppress bandits and had come to detain the ship. The townspeople were not suspicious at the time. It was not until 3 PM, when the Jia'e ship arrived at the port, that the armed men went aboard the ship, drove the passengers ashore, then boarded the ship themselves and ordered the captain to sail into the lake. The incident was learned by the 14th Water Police Team stationed near Dangkou. The water police team went to investigate and learned that they were not regular soldiers. When asked, the local people did not see any unit number either. They immediately telegraphed Shen, the district chief of the 3rd Water Police District of Suzhou. Upon hearing the news, Shen immediately dispatched a team to Yangcheng Lake to launch an attack from both sides with the 14th Team in order to eliminate the bandits.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Suzhou Middle School Association Petitions the Executive Yuan for Education Funding <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Teachers' Association Resigns En Masse to the China Middle School Association</p>
<p>The Suzhou Middle School Association and the Teachers' Association sent a telegram to the Nanjing Executive Yuan addressed to President Sun and all members of the Council stating: "The dispute over Suzhou education funding and the Central University funding can only be resolved if the Ministry of Finance bears the full cost of Central University. If temporary measures are taken and compromises are made, it will inevitably lead to disturbances and eventually ruin everyone. We pledge not to recognize this. The Suzhou Middle School Association and Teachers' Association kowtow."</p>
<p>The Suzhou Middle School Association replied to the China Middle School Association's letter of resignation stating: "We have received your letter dated January 14th stating that in order to support the Provincial Government's proposal to cease the allocation of Central University funding, you intend to submit a collective resignation to our Association. We have investigated that the provisional budget regulations issued by the Central Government in the nineteenth year stipulated that national taxes should fund national schools and provincial taxes should fund provincial schools. The boundary is extremely clear. Central University occupies provincial taxes because of historical reasons. Now, it has become a habit that cannot be changed. The resolution of the third meeting of the Executive Yuan clearly contradicts the aforementioned regulations. If Suzhou Province is forever burdened with this, it will undoubtedly lead Suzhou education to its death. Your opinion is extremely admirable. In addition to having our entire Association petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and the Provincial Government for consideration, we have also issued a declaration seeking public opinion and appealing to the Executive Yuan to argue our case reasonably. We will always follow the same path as your Association in the hope of extending the fate of our province's education. In the event that things do not go as desired and the goal is not achieved, we will also be unable to take responsibility and will have the same attitude as all of you, stepping aside for more capable individuals. However, at this time of uncertainty, we still rely on joint efforts to proceed and cannot be passive. Therefore, your opinion on collective resignation should be temporarily withdrawn. We are in the same boat through thick and thin, and our friendship is crucial to mutual support. We look forward to your cooperation. This is addressed to the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Teachers' Association. Sincerely, the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Association, January 24th."</p>
<p>The Military Teachers' Association sent a letter of resignation to the China Middle School Association stating: "We are writing to inform you that at the Provincial Government meeting on January 8th, a resolution was passed to cease the allocation of Central University funding by the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, which is a fundamental solution to the Suzhou education funding problem. Upon reading the resolution of the third meeting of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, that the Suzhou Education Funding Management Office should permanently allocate 1.32 million yuan in annual funding to Central University, it is tantamount to leading Suzhou education to its death. It is clear that national taxes should fund national schools and provincial taxes should fund provincial schools. The reasons are very sufficient. The remedial measures for Suzhou education funding proposed by Director Zhou are very important. At the emergency meeting of the Provisional Representative Assembly of our Association on the afternoon of January 13th, it was decided that whether or not Suzhou Province ceases the allocation of Central University funding is related to the fate of secondary education in the entire province. Therefore, in addition to issuing a declaration to the outside world and publicly recommending representatives to petition in Beijing, in order to support the resolution of the Provincial Government, our Association will submit a collective resignation to your Association. This letter is to inform you and we hope you will take it into consideration. This is addressed to the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Association. Sincerely, the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Teachers' Association, January 14th."</p>

<p>Issuing Study Abroad Funds In recent years, Jiangxi Province has increased its educational funding, so many students have been subsidized to study abroad. However, due to financial difficulties, government fees and subsidies for students studying in various countries have been overdue for more than half a year.

He specially raised funds to issue the arrears for July of the previous year in full, which has been handed over to the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank for remittance.</p>

<p>Revising the Name of the Education Garden Chen Changsong, the director of the preparation for the Jiangxi Fallen Soldiers Cemetery Education Garden, requested the Department of Education to forward a request to the Provincial Government to quickly allocate the 15,050 yuan out of the 20,000 yuan that had not been issued due to long-term financial difficulties. The Department of Education immediately forwarded the request to the Provincial Government and attached its opinion that in view of the province's depleted treasury, the establishment of an education garden was actually beyond its means, but in order to commemorate the martyrs and protect the cemetery, it seemed appropriate to start by planting trees in the garden and proposed to change the name of the garden to the Jiangxi Martyrs Cemetery Forest Garden.</p>

<p>Gao Jianfu, a famous calligrapher from Guangdong, returned to Calcutta from the Himalayas and then went to the Lion Country (Colombo) to promote Chinese culture and study the Theravada Buddhism there. He reportedly gave a lecture on Buddhist art at the Buddhist Association of Ceylon yesterday, which was attended by many people. He later opened an art exhibition at the Young Men's Buddhist Association in Bolina for five days. People from various countries came to visit in droves. This is the first time that Chinese art has entered the territory of Ceylon, so there was such enthusiasm. The art community was stimulated by this kind of approach, and the atmosphere suddenly changed. Various associations were set up to study the art, and it was agreed that this kind of Chinese art is truly the light of our Eastern culture and needs to be developed together. After the meeting, those who heard the news and arrived late were disappointed. They earnestly requested the association to ask Gao to hold another exhibition to satisfy the audience and planned to continue it for three more days starting tomorrow. It is also reported that Gao has jointly prepared a pan-Asian art exposition with various art groups in Ceylon and India and plans to hold it in India in the fall of next year.</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association of Students of Various Universities issued a notice to all universities to suspend classes for two days to raise funds to aid the Ma. Although St. John's University still held classes as usual, it never lagged behind others in the patriotic movement. It is reported that the school, together with the Zhongxi and St. Mary's Girls' Schools, raised a total of 1,924 yuan and 49 cents, which was deposited with the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the school. At that time, due to poor remittance conditions and external rumors that all donations to aid the Ma were withheld by Zhang Jinghui, the school delayed the remittance to observe the situation for the sake of prudence. It was not until the 24th of last month that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the school handed over all the donations to the Life Weekly, entrusting it to inquire about the truth and remit it on its behalf.</p>

<p>Gold Price Too High, Funding Difficulties</p>
<p>Cannot Wait Until Next Year</p>
<p>Hopes for Establishment of New Asian Zone</p>
<p>Australia Changes to American Zone</p>
<p>Regarding the Davis Cup World Tennis Tournament, there was talk last year of establishing an Asian Zone, including countries such as China, the Philippines, Australia, India, Japan, and Malaysia. Australian Davis Cup veteran Brookes strongly advocated for this. When he went to Manila, he met with Philippine Governor Davis, the initiator of the cup, and presented the cup. Brookes argued that currently there are only European and American zones, and it is too costly in terms of time and money for Asian and Eastern countries to travel long distances to Europe and America to participate. Moreover, there are many Asian countries, so the reasoning is very sound. The Philippine Governor seemed to agree, but this year it has not been realized. According to Australian news, Australia was originally scheduled to join the Asian Zone this year, but since it has not been established, it has changed to the American Zone. During the last board meeting of the National Sports Association, there was a proposal by Lin Qiu to participate in this year's Davis Cup, so a special inquiry was made to Secretary-General Shen Siliang for his opinion. Shen said that with the current high price of gold, it is difficult for China to participate in the Davis Cup unless private individuals and the government can provide donations and assistance. If the Asian Zone is established, he will do his best to ensure China participates every year, as it will be more economical and easier to plan. Therefore, he strongly hopes it can be realized. Now that the new zone is not established for the time being, China's participation can only be postponed until next year.</p>

<p>Qingguang Defeats Zhenru...45 to 33</p>
<p>Xiqing Defeats Huadong...45 to 28</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association had a total of four matches last night. The game between Qingguang and Zhenru was the most intense. The details of each game are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e94">Qingguang Turns Defeat into Victory <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Qingguang was briefly dimmed. Huang Zhaolin scored one free throw and one regular basket for Zhenru, putting them ahead 4-0. Qingguang's Tan Daling then scored a free throw, followed by a basket after Cai Rongrui of the opposing team mistakenly passed the signal. As the score narrowed, the lead changed hands frequently. Zhenru's center Chen Jinzhi showed quick footwork, accurately shooting four baskets, relying on his strength to maintain Zhenru's momentum. At that time, Qingguang's steps were chaotic and their defense was scattered, resulting in a score of 16-19 at halftime.</p>
<p>Zhenru lost momentum after the opening, with Yu Xuanzi scoring one basket. Qingguang seized the opportunity, with Tan adding two points, turning defeat into victory. Yang Shuhui and Yin Guiren each scored three points. Qingguang's Zhang Jinlin made a long-range shot, tying the score at 22. After this change, the situation for Qingguang and Zhenru changed dramatically, one side recovering its old form, the other declining after its peak. Within five minutes, Qingguang scored ten consecutive points, and Zhenru became a spent force, unable to do anything. In the end, Qingguang won 45-33, with Shao Ji as the referee.</p>

<p>Huadong Closely Follows The absence of Xiqing's general Ou Erpirei, replaced by Bai Naitet and Shi Kuiya, naturally reduced their strength. Huadong adopted a man-to-man marking strategy, following closely, with Li Shijun being the most rigorous, causing Smith of the opposing team to lose his color and not score a single basket. Chen Qidong was not as agile as Bai Naitet, allowing Bai Naitet to move freely and score the most points. At the beginning, the score was still close, but it gradually widened. At halftime, Xiqing was 23 and Huadong was 14.</p>
<p>Xiqing Advances Vigorously Huadong showed some promise amidst the shouts of renewed battle, but soon became sluggish again. Xiqing repeatedly substituted players and launched vigorous attacks. When the score reached 31-17, Huadong also changed its formation, with Dai Linzhen entering the court to replace Chen Qidong, briefly closing the gap to 31-23. However, within five minutes, Xiqing launched another major offensive, eventually winning 45-28. Shao Ji was the referee.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Donghua Won Against Lehua Yesterday <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>2-0 Group A Match</p>
<p>Two Goals in the First Half, Draw in the Second Half</p>
<p>The Lehua football team lost 0-2 to Donghua at the baseball field yesterday afternoon. Many people still came to watch. Lehua only lost 0-2 under Donghua's fierce attack, thanks to the goalkeeper Lu Zhongen's efforts. Donghua also showed mercy, making shots but not scoring. The formations of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Team</p>
<p>Qian Jingyong</p>
<p>Chen Pu, Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Wang Changying, Tu Kaiyuan, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, Li Yichen, Chen Yutian</p>
<p>Lehua Team</p>
<p>Yang Renwei</p>
<p>Lu Jin'en, Weng Kefa, Zhao Chouchen, Chen Ruisheng, Wan Xianghua, Sun Huipei, Jiang Chao, Chen Chao, Zhou Shaowen, Li Lin</p>
<h3 id="e99">Chen Hongguang Opens the Scoring First <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Referee He Chunhui blew the silver whistle, and Donghua kicked off, immediately adopting an aggressive offensive, reaching the goal. After hovering several times, Dai Linjing turned and saved a shot beautifully and accurately, flying towards the goal. Just when everyone thought it would go in, Lu Jin'en calmly caught it. They fought evenly matched for more than ten minutes. Li Yichen dribbled the ball up to the defensive line, dodged, and passed to Qian Jingyong. Arriving again at the goal, Lu Zhongen signaled Weng Kefa to kick it out, but an airborne general came from the sky. Chen Hongguang had already run up and shot it in.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Tu Kaiyuan Scores Another One <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Having lost, Lehua also issued a counter-attack order. Wan Xianghua bravely charged to the goal, but the "mad dog" was blocking the way, not letting go. Helpless, he returned defeated. The front of Lehua's goal was in emergency again. Dai Linjing led a large army and knocked on the goal again, passing to the side, intending to prompt Li Yichen to shoot. Li wanted to attack but couldn't. Tu Kaiyuan watched coldly from the sidelines, seeing the opportunity, and kicked it in. The first half ended with a score of 2-0.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Lu Zhongen is Very Busy <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, Lehua's situation remained dull, with no hope of opening up. Heavily stacked, it was full of Donghua's army within five steps, full of enemy traces. Donghua's generals actually stepped on the ball and shot at the goal, like a cannon fire. Lu Zhongen was very busy as the goalkeeper, fortunately with quick eyes and hands, reversing the adverse situation, jumping up and down, sending them all out one by one. According to Lu, he caught no less than fifty balls in total.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Dai Linjing Shows Mercy <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Originally, they were family, why be so ruthless? Donghua originally came from Lehua, so show some affection. This is why Dai Linjing's penalty kick did not score. Finally, Sun Huipei charged at Chen Pu in the penalty area, and referee He did not show any mercy, awarding a penalty kick, which was kicked by Dai Linjing, lightly swept, and went to the side, ending it like this.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Donghua is Sure to Have a Match on Saturday <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>

<h3 id="e106">National Crisis Conference and Celebrity Conference (Part 1) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of the National Crisis Conference is to resolve the national crisis. This can be inferred from the name itself. However, the powers have not been announced, the methods have not been clarified, and the people involved cannot understand it clearly, let alone the general public, which is even more vague. But one thing has been published in black and white: the list of appointed members announced by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Let's try to study this list. Regardless of how different these members' past histories are, or how opposed their current political views are, they all have one thing in common: they are all celebrities - famous people, whose names have been displayed in newspapers and cherished in the pockets of the authorities. The main component of this National Crisis Conference is celebrities. The National Crisis Conference can only be considered a celebrity conference, at most a conference of celebrities presenting suggestions for resolving the national crisis. It can't even be called an expert conference, because many of them are not experts.</p>
<p>The fundamental mistake of this list lies not in what it includes, but in what it omits - in the complete absence of those who should be there. No one can deny that the vast majority of the owners of the Republic of China are farmers and workers. Can we find a farmer who actually tills the land himself or a worker who actually does manual labor himself in this list? When the national crisis is at hand, how can we break through this difficult situation if we don't invite the vast majority of the owners to personally resolve it?</p>
<p>Some people say that the appointed members can all lay down their butcher knives and become Buddhas on the spot, meaning everyone can speak for the common people. The politics of recent years have been ruined by this word "substitute." First, they speak for the common people, then they eat for the common people, and finally they govern for the common people, leaving the common people first with nowhere to speak, then with no way to eat, and finally with no power to protect the country. Substitute! I wish the dictionary of the Republic of China would not have this heartbreaking word tomorrow!</p>
<h3 id="e107">Military Pigeons Did Not Originate in Japan <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Leishi</p>
<p>The Daily News reported a dispatch from Tianjin. The Japanese army recently transported more than two hundred carrier pigeons from the country to test their communication effectiveness in Shenyang, Shanhaiguan, and Tianjin. Flying from Shenyang to Tianjin takes two and a half hours, and from Shanhaiguan to Tianjin takes one hour. Some say that the Japanese are clever and quick-witted, and in addition to police dogs, they also have military pigeons. Little do they know that military pigeons were not invented by the Japanese. We used to have them often in our country. They were initially used to transmit information, and then extended to military use. Now, I will briefly list one or two examples from ancient books to dispel the erroneous view of being shocked by everything foreign while destroying our own spirit.</p>
<p>"Anecdotes of the Tianbao Era" states that Zhang Jiuling raised many pigeons at home when he was young. Whenever he had correspondence with relatives and friends, he would tie the letters to the pigeons' feet and they would fly to the instructed place. They were called "flying slaves." According to this, they already existed in the Tang Dynasty, but they were not used for military purposes.</p>
<p>"History of the Song Dynasty: Biography of Xia State" states that during the Qingli period of Emperor Renzong, Sang Yi was征服(conquering) Yuan Wu. On the way, he obtained several silver mud boxes with sounds of movement inside. He did not dare to open them. The chief commander Ren Fu arrived and opened them. There were more than a hundred pigeons with whistles hanging from them. They rose from the middle and circled above the army. Thereupon, the Xia soldiers converged from all directions. Fu fought bravely and the army was destroyed. According to this, they were used for military purposes.</p>
<p>"Qidong Yeyu" states that Zhang Jun inspected Qu Duan's army and found no one there. Zhang was surprised and said he wanted to review them. Duan presented the registers of the five armies under his command. Zhang ordered him to review one of the armies, so he opened a cage in the courtyard and released a pigeon. The army being reviewed arrived immediately. Zhang was astonished. Later, he wanted to see all of them, so he released all five pigeons, and the five armies gathered in an instant, with shining armor and bright flags. According to this, it also happened during the Song Dynasty. Perhaps military pigeons originated in the Song Dynasty?</p>
<p>Moreover, they also existed in modern times. During the Hong Yang Rebellion, when Zeng Guoquan besieged Nanjing, his brother Guofan, as the imperial envoy stationed in Anqing, used pigeons to transmit daily reports in the army. This is mentioned in Zhu Mei'an's book "Trivia from a Guest Window." It is said that he raised hundreds of pigeons.</p>

<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>There is an old woman in Lotus Pond, Hangzhou. She is blind and her husband died early. She struggles to make ends meet. However, she is very intelligent and has learned to calculate the five elements. She is determined and diligent. Before a year is over, she has thoroughly mastered the two trillion four hundred and forty-five billion five elements and six lines. When she talks to people about fortune and misfortune, she is always accurate. Therefore, her door is like a market. Officials and scholars come to resolve their doubts in an endless stream. Commoners and foolish women from the streets wait outside her door every day at dawn to ask for fortunes, often numbering in the hundreds. The divination fee is two jiao, and the registration fee is twelve copper coins, in the order of the lottery tickets obtained upon entering the door. Therefore, they often fight to grab lottery tickets when the door is opened. After obtaining a lottery ticket, they are allowed to enter the divination altar. On the altar is the divination deity, and below are four long benches that can accommodate twenty to thirty people. The number of people served in the morning is limited to thirty. It is not possible to get a number in place of someone else. In the afternoon, those from afar are served, with fees ranging from five to ten yuan. She can earn a hundred gold a day and now has assets of one hundred thousand. A certain director-general heard of this and was surprised. One day, he secretly sent a clerk to greet her, asking about future fortunes and misfortunes. The old woman finished calculating the five elements and frowned, stomping her feet and saying, "This person's fate has too many earth branches and heavenly stems. There is no doubt of corruption. Although there is much wealth, it is weak. The wife has great power. This year, the earth element is more obscure, transforming the hurting officer into Máo. Although collecting wealth is satisfying, the heavenly luck is ending. He will definitely suffer a great disaster. If he does not stop his corruption, retire early, cultivate his mind, and do good, disaster will be imminent." The director-general was shocked and lost color upon hearing this, angered by her irresponsible remarks and driving her out. The old woman left in disappointment. The director-general was also uneasy. He considered that the effect was uncertain. However, for the sake of fame and profit, he remained reluctant to leave his position. Before long, his son suddenly suffered a kidnapping and had to be ransomed for five hundred thousand yuan. In less than a few months, he was also dismissed from his position and imprisoned. Only then did he believe the old woman's words, which were completely accurate. Previously, when the director-general was the director-general of a certain province, he exploited in every possible way and was unusually corrupt. His wife, a certain Ms. Soong, was by nature悍泼. Many of the officials in the government office were her relatives. Those who wanted to seek a position had to bribe the wife with a thousand gold and agree to a four-six split of the profits. There was a certain Mr. Zhang from Hubei who sought a tax position but had no connections. He spared no expense and asked people to lobby for him. Unexpectedly, the matter was leaked and detected by a certain official. The director-general was implicated and imprisoned, and his property was confiscated. He soon died of illness.</p>

<p>— A Member of the Youth Aid Horse Corps, First Regiment</p>
<p>(14) Brief Summary of Beijing-Ping</p>
<p>We set off from Jinling University in the capital on the morning of December 28th last year and arrived in Beiping on the afternoon of January 3rd this year. It took six days and nights, passing through four provinces, a total of more than 2,300 li. Along the way, we braved the wind and snow, waking up early and sleeping early, living a simple life. Although we took vehicles along the way, who would willingly endure this hardship if it were not for saving the country? Fortunately, our ambition to kill the enemy will soon be rewarded, and our full of blood will not stop boiling.</p>
<p>Just as we were about to set off from Beijing to the north, we encountered a heavy snow. At the same time, the temperature dropped sharply, and it was extremely cold. Although we don't know how many degrees below zero on the thermometer, most of the comrades have been unable to bear it. After discussions by the cadres, everyone believed that the wind and snow ahead would be even more severe and the journey would be even more difficult. It was decided to temporarily station the entire team in Pukou.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Images of a Trip to the North and Other Things (9) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>A Self-Account by Movie Star Hu Die</p>
<p>On a winter evening when slanting winds and drizzle suddenly intertwined, the Beijing-Shanghai train sent us back to Shanghai. Shanghai was still bustling and bustling, no different from before we went to Beiping. But we brought back some real terror from the north, and we still felt somewhat alienated.</p>
<p>At the same time, our alienation is just like the alienation of others. China is originally a group that is mutually alienated, mutually suspicious, mutually distrustful, mutually destructive, mutually deceptive, and mutually engaged in things that harm others and do not benefit oneself. We are also considered unfortunate to live in such an environment, so even someone as small as I am cannot escape all kinds of rumors and slander beyond imagination.</p>
<p>I always think this way: Why does society treat women so harshly? I have suffered all kinds of treatment, and there are often many things that I don't know about, but others seem to spread them as if they were absolutely true. Under this kind of treatment and encounter, it is really not easy to live. If I ignore it, it will add to the ridicule. If I try to defend myself, it seems that a thousand facts of mine cannot抵消(offset) half a sentence of someone else's rumor. It seems that everything that should not be done should be done by women. Even if you haven't done it, they insist that you have done it and don't allow you to defend yourself. So, what methods can we use to provide a reasonable security?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I have been living under the mercury lamp for quite a few years. At the beginning of this profession, it was nothing more than for the sake of interest and the vertical aspects of life. I never dreamed of the gains I have now at that time, but I also never dreamed of the pain I have now at that time. Therefore, for my contradictory self, I dare not expect anything other than being loyal to my work and seeking protection and trust from my work.</p>
<p>The station. Director Zhang immediately crossed the river to Nanjing to raise overcoats. Fortunately, the Central Military Academy had many coats of discharged officers and soldiers in stock and granted us the right to use them. The problem of keeping warm was slightly resolved. On the 30th, the whole army began to advance.</p>
<p>When the train arrived in Jinan, we were not allowed to get off according to orders. At lunchtime, each person was only given a few pancakes as a meal. One comrade from the South was not used to eating this food. Helplessly, his five internal organs did not cooperate, and he had to force it down. It took him more than thirty minutes. Seeing him so pitiful, I couldn't help but ask him, "Comrade, is it hard for you to eat this?" He said, "No, it's not hard. If the country is destroyed, it will be hard to even want to eat this." How painful these words are!</p>
<p>We will never forget to thank the postal workers everywhere for their love. All the letters of this regiment were delivered properly and quickly. Even documents with only the two words "please deliver" written on the envelope could be查給(checked and given). This made them particularly troublesome. We are really grateful and ashamed.</p>
<p>From Beijing to Ping, the spirit of the entire team remained very strong. Several people joined us along the way. Especially commendable was a comrade who even caught up with us from Suzhou to enlist here in Beiping. Such a sincerity like a huge wave deserves people's praise. But the personality of one comrade was discovered by us to be evil. After discussions by the cadres, it was decided to expel him. A few comrades who could not bear the hardship temporarily asked to return to work in the rear. We did not force them and let them go on their own.</p>
<p>When our regimental headquarters was first established in Shanghai, it was originally intended to serve under General Benma in Heilongjiang. However, now the situation outside the Guan is precarious, and half of the country is about to be destroyed. After discussions by the whole group, everyone agreed that aiding the emergency should be the priority. Therefore, we changed the date to a rally within a few days to cross the Guan and cooperate with the volunteers in Jinxi.</p>

<p>— By the Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Yu and Liang Arrive Together, Scattering the Feast; Yin and Xing Avoid Each Other, Who Knows Who Lost the Jeweled Box?</p>
<p>Right now, your family is ruined, and your relatives are gone. You are all alone. From now on, you will have to take responsibility for yourself. You want to try hard to maintain yourself until you graduate, but you're already having economic problems. I wonder if your paternal uncle, An Dakui, will be willing to take care of you as much as he can. If you make any more mistakes, I'm afraid you won't have a good time right now. Even if you manage to graduate, all alone, you want to find a job and make a living in this society. Human relationships are so snobbish, and the world is so cold. As a young man without help or support like you, it won't be easy to achieve complete victory, establish a great career, hope to revive your family's fortune, and gain both fame and wealth. The road ahead is uncertain, and you'll have to put in a lot of effort everywhere you go to have a glimmer of hope. It's really going to be difficult for you. As for me, I'm even worse off than you. The bad environment is beyond description. The suffering in the family is also worse than anyone else's. Although fortunately my father is still alive, I don't seem as lonely as you right now. But you know my situation well. I can't rely on my father. It's as if he's there but not there. I've had no mother since I was a child, and my father is so stubborn and old-fashioned. He has no kindness towards me. He only knows how to spend his happy days with my few mean and stingy aunts. He has never put his unfortunate daughter in his heart. I couldn't stand their anger at home. After many requests and the persuasion of many relatives and friends, I was barely allowed to come to Beijing to study. The expenses outside for a year are like collecting bad debts. It takes a lot of talking and writing countless letters. After several rounds of haggling back and forth, they send me some money here and there in bits and pieces. I deal with it by cutting corners. Recently, my father also wrote to say that things are not going well in his position as county magistrate. The people are very difficult. They are not willing to pay the regular taxes and levies in full. The superiors in the provincial capital are sending urgent telegrams to demand additional funds and levies. It's like adding fuel to the fire. I'm afraid this position will not be able to be maintained sooner or later. He told me to write less letters home asking for money. Save as much as you can. If you can't save, please find money to use on your own outside with your own skills. Don't expect any more from home. You think, even if they are more difficult, how can they not afford my little tuition fee? Asking me to find money myself is even more ridiculous. I am an undergraduate student. How can I find money with my own skills? Originally, my father didn't approve of girls studying at all. So the reason he sent me to Beijing was just because my aunts wanted to get rid of me, this thorn in their side. Once I was sent out, they didn't want to care much about me. Fortunately, I met you here. We share the same goals and agree with each other. We planned a mutual assistance combination, so that I wouldn't be completely desperate. Unexpectedly, fate is still so bad. Now you have encountered this unexpected misfortune again. It is clear that our combination has suffered a major blow. Although we sympathize with each other and help each other in times of trouble, I will definitely not be ambiguous towards you. Nor will I be discouraged. It's just that I've suffered a lot and know my fate is thin. I'm very afraid that this is not a good omen. I don't know how bad things will get in the future. After speaking, sorrow came from within, and she burst into tears towards An Yutian.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the British silver suddenly fell back, and the US silver suddenly moved. Sellers were agile, and the exchange rate continued to rise. The same between Britain and the United States was 3 yuan, 4 corners, 6 cents, 375. Mumbai suddenly stopped the market. As for HSBC's listings, they all saw a slight contraction. The British gold was half a file (125), which was 1 shilling and 10 pence, 1375. The US dollar was still 32 yuan and 125, which was hedging the exchange rate. Hong Kong added 125, totaling 76 taels and 25. Except for the French franc, which did not change, all others were also trending better. Most banks' internal disks are trending tighter, but they are extremely peaceful and have no market head. As a result, the British gold shrank 125 compared with the previous day, and the US exchange rate also shrank 1875. The gold market rebounded by six taels. Most of the hedging was opened at fifty-six or seventy taels, but there was no important news at home or abroad.

The US dollar was also only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, with unequal entries and exits, and banks did a little bit of matching.

<p>Market Overview Yesterday, the silver ocean situation was outwardly peaceful, and in terms of price, ocean interest rates fell slightly, while silver interest loans increased sequentially upward. Bank collections were less than the previous day, and although the simplicity of the state was not certain, any simplification during the current closing period was better than usual. The exchange rate market generally fell back yesterday because the price was raised too high, resulting in a reaction.</p>
<p>Interest Loan Prices The early market interest rate of the ocean interest rate was 7 cents, 1 point, 6 cents, 5 mils, and the noon market was 7 cents, 1 point, 6 cents, 7 mils and a half. The result was a total drop of 1 cent, 3 mils, and 7 halves of a mil compared with the noon market of the previous day. The silver interest loan was 2 cents in the early market and 1 cent and 8 cents in the noon market. The bank listed 8 cents, plus 34 cents. The market situation of the Jiangnan small ocean was 6 cents, 6 cents, and 5 mils in both the early and noon markets, and the situation was stable. The transactions made were 5,000 corners in the early market and 3,000 corners in the noon market. The early market for the Guangdong small ocean was 6 cents, 6 cents, 1 point, 2 mils and a half, and the noon market was 6 cents, 6 cents, 2 mils and 7 halves of a mil. The transactions made were 210,000 corners in the early market and 80,000 corners in the noon market. The courier of copper coins was 2,500 yuan, totaling 369,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Silver Ocean Entries and Exits "Silver Funds" Yesterday's bank collection news included 1.67 million yuan in ticket funds collected by Chinese merchants, more than 1.2 million yuan in ticket funds collected by foreign merchants, 7.23 million yuan in various remaining association exchange tax funds, 2.78 million yuan in special funds, 900,000 yuan out of the warehouse, 47.3 million yuan collected by silver public money houses, 4.3 million yuan collected by Liu tou funds, more than 700,000 yuan in various exchange funds, and 600,000 to 700,000 yuan collected in cash. The ocean fund exchange ticket fund made 2.19 million yuan in the early market and 2.105 million yuan in the noon market. Banknotes were 75,000 yuan in the early market and 40,000 yuan in the noon market. Off-market banknotes were 185,000 yuan in the early market and 125,000 yuan in the noon market.

<h3 id="e117">Future Outlook on Tight and Loose Silver Funds <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Silver-scarce households may compete to enter</p>
<p>Slightly higher market prospects are not unusual</p>
<p>According to people in the industry yesterday, in the most recent ten-day closing period, the situation of tight and loose silver funds, based on the general trend, seems unlikely to rise. It is expected that there will be no tightening of silver funds in the next few days, but I am afraid there will be no opportunities for relaxation. Currently, business affairs are ending, and the demand for silver will inevitably be weak. Since there is no use, it is difficult for silver interest loans to be激昂. As for silver-scarce households, they still exist, and they are all inevitable. There may also be competitive entries, or slightly higher prices, which are also unknown. In summary, no major issues can be asserted.</p>

Among them, the unified tax accounted for more than 2 million, the 19 customs, 20 customs, rolled salt tax, etc. each accounted for 1.45 million, the compiled remnants accounted for about 1 million each for 19 good deeds, and the others were only hundreds of thousands of yuan. In addition to the 435,000 yuan that was previously transferred in advance, due to time constraints, there was no advance delivery in practice, so the actual delivery volume was still more than 11.4 million. The delivery process continued to be smooth, it is said. The following table lists the January futures delivery and transfer amounts of each bond (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending weaker, and the decline is intensifying, probably because the current situation is getting worse and worse,</p>
<p>causing people's hearts to be weak, and scattered households are selling in unison, so the market trend is falling accordingly. As for the actual sales of customers, they have also been hit by rumors, and they have reported 清澹. However, this month is the last day, and the delivery is lacking, so it has risen by two, it is said.</p>
<p>The human standard has fallen far. The human standard opened in the Outer Exchange. Foreign cotton was flat, and rumors were flying, causing a lack of buyers in the field, and the selling atmosphere was strong. Each fell by one or two, five, six, and eight cents. In the afternoon, scattered households for this month made up for only one or two or three cents, and the rest was flat. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 40,900 bales.

<p>March 1535 1858,950 June 1533 1534,800</p>
<p>The current yarn is still selling slowly. The current yarn sales are flat. Check that the total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day was 400 bales. 10 bales entered the same industry. The market was flat. 250 bales were entered from Guangdong, 10 bales from Fujian, 45 bales from inland areas, and 60 bales from Shantou, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Cotton Market Remains Firm <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The source is not prosperous... the stock is thin.</p>
<p>The cotton market is firm because the overseas cotton market is calm, and the exchange rate has not changed much. Also, because the closing period is near, the sources from all roads are declining, so the market is very consolidated. However, some people still think it is tired, because the actual demand is not smooth. However, the holders see that the arrivals from all places are very rare, and the inventory is thin, so they are unwilling to compromise on the selling price, so the asking price is high, it is said.</p>
<p>The Han standard is recently weak, and the distant standard is firm. Transactions The Han standard opened in the early market. Foreign cotton was flat, and the yarn market was trending down, causing the popularity to be flat and tired, falling five cents to one cent. In the afternoon, each month rebounded by two cents to five cents. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 39,200 piculs. Check that Gongtai sold 1,600 piculs, Yuda 2,300 piculs, Hengde 1,900 piculs, and Dachang 1,900 piculs.

<p>More than 30 ships arrived in Hunan yesterday. There was a slight deposit in Pudong. Both urban and rural tastes are sluggish. Houxin Japonica has shortened by half a corner. There is a slight appetite for early 稌稻寧. There is slightly less turnover in this street, resulting in a small price of five cents. Although there are not many goods that are 通變陰化, the sales are not smooth, resulting in price revisions. 藘尖 arrives and competes with sales. The market continues to settle. There is a lack of 洋尖貨 on the market.</p>
<p>The foot of the Xinzha River 苏昆 white japonica is looser than before, so the customer takes this opportunity to slacken during the year-end period. Due to the influence of the top customers, the opening price of Dubu Top has been reduced by one corner. The glutinous rice cake shops of Chonggu 青角薄稻 are still needed, and the trend has turned to stability. There are ten readings of Changxi 北粳 sources, and the trading of high-quality goods is sluggish. Secondary colors are slightly moving. Jiangyin rice has seen a fatigue of one corner.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Foreign Rice Sales are Sluggish and Turning Soft <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation was that due to the unstable current situation, entries were suspended, and all rice was in a flat and soft situation. The unified market opened 200 bags of 白勝小絞, priced at 10 yuan and 1 corner. 200 bags of ordinary small twisted rice were priced at 9 yuan and 7 corners, all of which were handled by this street. 40 bags of Jiangxi 客元 were also handled by this street, priced at 13 yuan and 7 corners and a half.

<p>Yesterday's market, the morning opening, due to the small quotation of foreign wheat at 2 corners, was unstable for a while. However, because the minds of outsiders are still firm, it has also returned to a clever market. This month, it has reached 1.9 cents. Distant months have also been determined. However, due to the continuous ordering of foreign wheat by factories, they opened in the morning and afternoon and successively released their files. In the afternoon, the sale was even more active, so from February onwards, it gradually fell step by step. According to this situation, if the source of foreign wheat is endless, it seems difficult to ask for a good price, it is said. As a result, this month was 2.5 mils less than the previous day, February was 7.5 mils less, March was 2 cents less, April was 1 cent and 2.5 mils less, May was 7.5 mils less, and June was 1.5 cents less, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market generally showed ups and downs in each month after the opening in the morning and afternoon. In early February, it was still flat and tired. Then, due to the scarcity of the delivery volume in this month, foreign empty households were very eager to make up for it, so it was clever and profitable. In the distant future, the price of foreign wheat was still around 2 corners less. It was also reported that a certain factory had continued to order Australian wheat at a price of 3 taels, 7 cents and 1 point. Therefore, people's hearts were not stable, and the deal was finalized yesterday, and the hedging households released their files, causing the trend to soften again. The delivery quantity this month is estimated to be six cars of local wheat collected by Dingtai. It is said that there were more than ten cars of those who giao割 outside the house. As a result, this month was 3 cents better than the previous day, March was 3 cents down, April was immobile, May was 1 cent less, and June was 2 cents less, it is said.</p>

<p>Purchased by Hangzhou Silk Merchants as Silk Weaving Raw Materials</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign silk market in this port became more and more tired, because the overseas white factory had passed the price increasingly small. New York B-grade was only 720-30 taels. The factory side had to lose 300-400 taels per package, which made it difficult to throw away. Yesterday, only Hangzhou silk merchants entered ten packages of B-grade white factory, priced at only 680 taels. The Indian silk merchant entered ten packages of yellow coarse silk, and the price was also flat and tired. Shanghai manufacturers sold silk to inland silk merchants without adding export taxes and surcharges, which was slightly lighter than the foreign silk merchants, it is said.</p>

<p>Most of the silk cocoon scraps produced in Hangzhou, Shaoxing and other places, such as cocoon clothes, moth mouths, and long spouts, have been transported to the Shanghai stack.

<p>Yesterday's foreign tea market in this port, the special precious eyebrows of Lailu Zhuang, Tongfu Baochang and other banks, continued to search and buy yesterday, and the transactions were not lonely. However, the selling plate was slightly softer than before, because the tea merchants who came to China were eager to sell due to the serious current situation, and the market price fell by four or five taels as a result. As for other patterns, there is a lack of inventory in the market, and the supply is already in short supply, it is said.</p>

<p>Recently, the sales of Kailuan Coal No. 1 have been slightly slower, and the price has also been slightly looser, now selling for 10 taels per ton. The sales of No. 2 chips are still good, and the price is also firmer, with the market price being 9 taels and 5 cents per ton. The sales of lump coal are the best, but the arrival is rare, and the coal storage is not much, so the batch dismantling price of the same industry is mutually raised. Yesterday, the selling price of Kailuan was said to be 11 taels and 5 cents per ton.</p>

<p>Rumors arose in Shanghai yesterday, stating that from 6 PM, ships would not be allowed to sail from Wusong, and Shanghai-bound ships would have to sail earlier or cease night navigation. After investigation, it has been learned that while defenses at Wusong have indeed been strengthened, there are no restrictions on ship traffic. Therefore, ships such as the Ningbo liner sailed as scheduled yesterday without impediment.</p>

<p>Japanese Marines Landed in Pudong Yesterday, It Is Said</p>
<p>To protect the Japanese-Chinese cotton mill. After negotiations, they withdrew after two hours. The situation in Shanghai has become increasingly serious recently. Yesterday morning at around 11 AM, over twenty Japanese marines landed at Lujiazui in Pudong, claiming to be there to protect the First and Second Factories of the Japanese-Chinese cotton mill in the area. They did not withdraw until after 1 PM, after negotiations by our side. The situation is described below:</p>
<p>Chinese Police Protect the Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill in Lujiazui, Pudong</p>
<p>In addition to Chinese workers, there are many Japanese staff in the First and Second Factories of the Japanese-Chinese cotton mill. Since the burning of the Sanyou Industrial Company factory, tensions have risen sharply in Shanghai. The Japanese staff of the cotton mill immediately stated that the factory was not without danger and required strong protection. The Third District Public Security Bureau, which has jurisdiction over the area, has provided very tight protection for the factory.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Landed</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM yesterday, Japanese marines suddenly arrived by ship and landed at Lujiazui. There were over twenty marines, each carrying machine guns and rifles. After landing, they went to the front of the Japanese-Chinese cotton mill and patrolled back and forth. The nearby residents were greatly alarmed.</p>
<p>Negotiations Between Authorities and Japanese Marines Regarding the Landing</p>
<p>Zhang Mingqin, the district head of the Third District, immediately led police officers to the site to negotiate with the marines. The marines stated that the Japanese staff inside the Japanese-Chinese cotton mill were in danger, fearing that Chinese people would harm them, so they came to protect them. District Head Zhang replied that the factory was located within the Chinese territory and that the Chinese authorities had the strength to maintain local security and protect foreign nationals, so there was no need for Japanese troops to assist. The marines then withdrew.</p>
<p>Japanese Marines Withdrew After Negotiations with District Head Zhang</p>

<p>Reported to the City Government</p>
<p>After the incident, District Head Zhang immediately reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau. At this time, Japanese Vice-Consul Shirai Yasushi also visited Director Wen Yingxing and Section Chief Shen, briefly discussing the matter and hoping that the Sino-Japanese conflict would be resolved as soon as possible. Director Wen then went to the City Government at 3 PM to report on the incident.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Preparations in Shanghai Were Stepped Up; Defenses Were Tightly Arranged in Zhabei</p>
<p>Since the 24th of this month, barricades of sandbags and barbed wire have been erected at key intersections in Zhabei. However, the sandbags were piled too low, so on the day before yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched police officers to lead laborers, using a large number of sacks, to fill them with sand and mud in the open space north of the Huzhou Guild Hall, and transport them to various locations to pile up, and to raise the height of the existing barricades at intersections. Those that have been completed, such as the intersections of Zhongxing Road and Gonghe Xin Road, Yongxing Small Road, Yongxing Branch Road, and Yuyingtang Road, are all sandbags. From the Huzhou Guild Hall eastward, there are barbed wire fences. To the south, from the intersections of Yongxing Road, Xiangshan Road, and Huiwen Road and Zhongxing Road, in addition to extremely high sandbags, there are also barbed wire fences. During the day, the middle section of the barbed wire fence is removed to allow pedestrian and vehicle traffic. After 12:00 midnight, or when necessary, it is used to block traffic. Multiple barbed wire fences have also been erected at the intersections of Gongxing Road and Baotong Road. Regarding Baoshan Road, in addition to the extremely tight sandbag and barbed wire barricades erected north of the Baoshan Road Railway Station, there are also similar defenses at the Yokohama Bridge, also known as the Baoshan Bridge (at the northern end of Baoshan Road). Some defenses have also been erected about ten yards south of the Nanguang Alley intersection (in front of the Small Vegetable Market), which is a little over ten yards away from the Baoshan Bridge. Other defenses are either already in place or are being constructed. The arrangements are extremely tight. However, trains on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Nanjing lines continue to run as usual, arriving at their stations on time.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the Zhabei Security Corps</p>
<p>In view of the serious situation of the Shanghai Incident and the importance of defense, the Zhabei Security Corps held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 PM at its headquarters on Nanxing Road.

<p>Safety Issues in the Concessions: The Municipal Council Has Made Adequate Preparations</p>
<p>Mr. Feetham stated that yesterday, due to the rampant rumors, a Pacific News Agency reporter specifically visited Mr. Feetham, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council. He was received and questioned about the re-publication of the Republican Daily and the attitude towards the anti-Japanese movement. Mr. Feetham replied that the Municipal Council's purpose is solely to maintain law and order. Previously, because the Republican Daily published news about the Japanese marines, it caused disputes. The Municipal Council did not want to cause even more serious misunderstandings because of this, so it advised the newspaper to suspend publication in good faith. If the Sino-Japanese</p>
<p>Page 14</p>
<p>incident can be resolved satisfactorily, then there will be no problem with resuming publication. If the Sino-Japanese relationship unfortunately deteriorates, even to the point of conflict, then that is something that we cannot decide at the moment. The reporter also asked, "There are widespread rumors abroad, roughly saying that the Japanese side is demanding the cessation of the anti-Japanese movement; otherwise, they may prepare for direct action. What is the attitude of the Municipal Council?" He replied, "This may be purely external rumors. The Japanese side and Commander Shiozawa himself have not made a demand to the Municipal Council to disband the anti-Japanese associations, and I have not made such a suggestion either. The Municipal Council will definitely not suppress the patriotic movement of the Chinese people. The rumors mentioned above may refer to rumors of direct action by the Japanese side towards the Chinese territory. In short, regarding responsibility within the Concession, the Municipal Council will do its utmost to prevent Sino-Japanese conflict or actions that disrupt law and order." He was asked, "It is rumored that you, in your personal capacity, will act as a mediator in this Sino-Japanese incident. Is this true?" He replied, "I would be very happy to do so in my personal capacity, but it seems that there will not be more serious facts discovered at the moment. If there are any within the Concession, the Municipal Council will do its best to ensure the safety of the residents of the Concession and is even willing to do everything possible to seek an early resolution to the Sino-Japanese incident."</p>
<p>The Municipal Council is on Alert</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that after discussions last night (26th) with the commanders of the British and American forces stationed in Shanghai and the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the Municipal Council authorities decided to make practical preparations to protect life and property within the International Settlement. The first step is to build barbed wire fences at key points around the perimeter of the Concession. This plan is only for precautionary purposes. If the situation becomes tense, it will be expanded. It was also agreed that if an emergency occurs, the British army will take over the defense of the Western District, the US Marines will be responsible for patrolling the Suzhou Creek area, and the Volunteer Corps will protect the Central District. Similar protection plans will also be implemented in the Northern and Eastern Districts.</p>
<p>US Marines on Alert</p>
<p>The Greater Shanghai Evening News reported that Japanese Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Shiozawa met with officials from the Municipal Council and the commander of the Shanghai Defense Forces this morning (27th). The results were not released. It is reported that the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai has been ordered to be on alert. 50% of their passes have been revoked. The remaining 50% are allowed to leave the camp, but may not go beyond the Garden Bridge or Edinburgh Road.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi and Li Zongren Arrive in Shanghai Last Night, Sun Ke Still Makes No Statements, Chen Mingshu Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>After the resignation of President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke, the Central Government repeatedly sent senior officials to Shanghai to persuade him to stay. Kong Xiangxi, bearing the mandate of Chiang Kai-shek, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 8 AM yesterday, carrying a second personal letter from Chiang to Sun, urging Sun to go to Nanjing as soon as possible to discuss national affairs together. The letter will be delivered to Sun through his friends. Li Zongren and Ma Chaojun also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing last night. Li drove to visit Sun Ke at 3:40 PM. Sun has made no statement regarding reinstatement. Vice President of the Executive Yuan Chen Mingshu was also ordered by the Central Government to come to Shanghai and is scheduled to arrive this morning to meet with Sun and make a final attempt to persuade him.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou Discusses the Central Government Loan Issue, Shanghai Can Raise Up to 8 Million Yuan, the Issue Can Be Resolved if Someone Is in Charge at the Central Level</p>
<p>According to Finance News Agency reporters who interviewed Finance Official Lin Kanghou yesterday, the Shanghai financial community plans to raise 8 million yuan for the Central Government loan. The allocation method is as follows: the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China will provide a total of 4 million yuan, various commercial banks will provide 2 million yuan, the money industry will provide 1 million yuan, and the Stock Exchange Federation will provide 1 million yuan. The Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China are generally expected to have no major problems. The Stock Exchange Federation has requested to reduce its share to 500,000 yuan, and the money industry has requested that it be reduced to 500,000 yuan as well. Some commercial banks have also requested to reduce their numbers. In general, the amount of 8 million yuan may be able to be raised. However, after the resignations of Executive Yuan President Sun and Finance Minister Huang, no one is in charge at the Central level, causing the loan issue, which had been successfully negotiated, to come to a halt midway. The loan issue needs to be resolved after someone is in charge at the Central level. After Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin discussed loan-related matters at the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office the night before last, he has already returned to Nanjing. Today, the Bankers' Association will hold a meeting, and I (Lin, referring to himself) will attend to report on the discussions with Minister He.</p>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang to Return to Shanghai Immediately from Hong Kong</p>
<p>According to Jiji News, after resigning from the position of Minister of the Navy, National Government Committee Member Yang Shuzhuang has repeatedly and firmly declined the position of Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government. He has been suffering from a severe lung illness and frequently coughs up blood, so he specifically moved to Hong Kong to recuperate. Now, because there are private matters to be dealt with in Shanghai, he is rushing to Shanghai and is scheduled to arrive on February 12. We have already received a personal telegram from Mr. Yang stating this.</p>
<p>There Will Be British Troops Coming to Shanghai, But It Has Nothing to Do with the Situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the First Battalion of the British Wiltshire Regiment will arrive in Shanghai on Saturday and Sunday on the Lancashire transport ship from Egypt, replacing the Royal Scottish Regiment. It has nothing to do with the situation in China. The current situation in Shanghai does not justify increasing the number of British troops. In addition to the 270 men who have joined the First Battalion arriving from Egypt, the Royal Scottish Regiment will return to England on February 6 on the Lancashire transport ship. When the ship arrives in Shanghai on Saturday and Sunday, it will also carry 150 troops replacing the Tianjin garrison. After arriving in Shanghai, they will temporarily reside in the Hongkou barracks. Therefore, all the arrangements made in the Hongkou barracks these days have nothing to do with the current situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Cotton Mills to Close Down Completely Today</p>
<p>Regarding the reports about the Japanese-run cotton mills in this port preparing to suspend operations, this newspaper has reported on them repeatedly. Yesterday, the China Cotton Spinning Association held an emergency meeting and decided to completely close down the mills today (28th). It is reported that all 24 Japanese nationals at the Wusong Huafeng Cotton Mill also left the factory yesterday to return to their home country. Over a thousand workers were paid their wages yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Wusong Huafeng Cotton Mill Suspends Operations Due to Martial Law from Today; Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Mediate</p>
<p>The Wusong Yunzaobang Japanese-owned Huafeng Cotton Mill (i.e., the Eighth Factory of the Japanese-Chinese Cotton Spinning Co., Ltd.) has 25,600 cotton spindles and 11,520 yarn spindles, and employs over 2,000 Chinese workers. Since the start of the National Salvation Movement and the boycott, the stock has piled up. Now, due to the current situation and the imposition of martial law in Wusong, which is inconvenient for work, a formal notice was issued yesterday officially announcing the suspension of operations from today. Personnel have been dispatched to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request protection. Upon hearing the news, all the workers, fearing that they would be unable to make a living if operations were suspended once the end of the year arrives, have reported to the Eighth District Party Headquarters and the Eighth District Cotton Spinning Industry Union, requesting assistance. The Municipal Public Security Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau have scheduled to dispatch personnel today to jointly visit and find ways to mediate.</p>
<p>The Navy's New Aircraft, Jiangfeng, Conducts Test Flight</p>
<p>The Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Department completed the Jianghe and Jiangfeng, two new aircraft, last month. The Jianghe has already undergone a test flight and is now being modified with land wheels. The Jiangfeng also underwent a test flight yesterday afternoon at 3 PM at the Longhua Pumi Water Aerodrome. Director of the Naval Aviation Department Shen Dexie personally piloted the aircraft, circling the sky once before landing on the water surface. The results were quite good.</p>
<p>Deputy Captain of the Yuzhang Has Been Ordered to Report to Nanjing; If the Sunken Ship Is Difficult to Salvage, It Is Proposed to Be Blown Up</p>
<p>Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan came to Shanghai yesterday and stated that most of the naval vessels are currently being repaired in Shanghai and there have been no major movements. The Yuzhang torpedo boat, which sank on Qingti Reef in Tongzhou, is currently being salvaged. However, the sunken area is dozens of feet deep and cannot be seen at all. Furthermore, a telegram was received today stating that the seabed sediment in that area is rapidly shifting, which will increase the difficulty if the ship is submerged by sand. Therefore, these matters are currently being considered. If the ship cannot be salvaged, it is proposed to remove the detachable parts and then destroy the ship's hull. Otherwise, the main thoroughfare will obstruct ships. However, the loss from destroying the Yuzhang would naturally be greater than salvaging it. Feng Zhou, the deputy captain of the ship, has been ordered to report to Nanjing and is currently being interrogated by a special court organized by the Navy Department. If the point of Commander Feng's negligence is clarified after the interrogation, there will be punishment, but this is not yet known.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Issues Instructions to Strictly Practice Economy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government issued instructions yesterday to personnel in the government and affiliated bureaus, stating: "According to the Executive Yuan's instructions, in recent times, the country has suffered many misfortunes and frequent disasters, financial resources have become increasingly scarce, and the people's livelihoods have become increasingly strained. It is extremely difficult to maintain the economy. Unless the entire country, from top to bottom, strictly practices economy and eliminates extravagance, it will not be possible to cultivate vitality and avert danger. The motion to promote economy, which was passed by the Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee, has been followed by the Executive Yuan. Now that the national crisis has not yet subsided and the people's hardship has not been relieved, public and private expenditures must be tightened. All administrative agencies and their subordinate civil servants, who serve the country and take from the people, should share the burden, strictly practice economy, and strive to reduce all unnecessary expenditures. There should be no extravagance. All improper consumption and entertainment should be eliminated. By setting an example, we can eradicate the roots of corruption, change long-standing habits, and cultivate a culture of thrift. This is the key to saving the country. Apart from issuing separate orders, we hereby order you to comply and instruct all to comply.</p>
<p>The China General Edison Company Issues a Notice on Welfare Benefits for Employees</p>
<p>Regarding the employee benefits of the China General Edison Company, the company sets aside 10% of the employee's salary each year and names it the employee savings fund, which has been implemented since January 1924. As of the end of May of last year (1931), a total of more than 90,000 yuan has been saved. From June 1 of last year, the previous savings were stopped and new regulations were made. Therefore, although all employees have requested the company to return the savings to each individual, it is currently being negotiated. Suddenly, a misunderstanding occurred among the workers, who also requested the company to withdraw 60% of the employee savings and give it to the workers. After discussion by the board of directors, it was decided that the company has a worker welfare and education fund that is set aside annually. After signing the labor-capital treatment agreement in 1927, the worker welfare and education fund was transferred to the worker children's school expenses and then the savings were stopped. The current balance is also more than 9,000 yuan, with clear boundaries. Therefore, all the workers gathered at the company yesterday morning, asking the manager to accept the previous request. The Postal Workers' Union representative Zhu Xuefan and the director of the board, Du Yuesheng, sent representatives to the company to negotiate with both labor and capital. At 5 PM, everyone dispersed. The company's manager Lu Bohong issued two notices and posted them inside the company. (1) As a notice, according to the application of various employees, the company's total employee savings that have been set aside each year since January of the 13th year of the Republic of China (i.e., the Jiazi year) were terminated at the end of May of last year (1931). This savings fund should be requested from the company to be allocated and distributed immediately in order to conclude. It was submitted to the company's board of directors for a resolution. Although the above-mentioned welfare pension fund was set aside before the end of May of the 20th year, it should still be checked in accordance with the resolution of the meeting on February 23 of the 13th year. Employees can only receive it if they have served in the company for 12 years starting from March of the 13th year. Please ask the manager to notify all employees to check, etc. Therefore, it should be recorded and notified, so that everyone is aware. This is the notice. (2) Regarding the requests of all the workers in the company, the company expressed its acceptance, but it must be resolved at an emergency board of directors meeting next year. A reply will be given at noon the day after tomorrow. May all the workers work in peace and wait for a reply. This is the notice.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Anti-Japanese Association to Be Abolished <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Government Orders Public Safety and Social Affairs Bureaus to Comply</p>
<p>The Municipal Government ordered the Public Safety Bureau yesterday to abolish all anti-Japanese associations in the city. The original order is excerpted below: "Order for compliance: Since our country suffered calamity, the people of this city, deeply concerned about their country, formed various anti-Japanese national salvation associations. Unfortunately, their actions were inappropriate, leading to numerous criticisms. Furthermore, local civic groups submitted petitions to the government, requesting relief. After careful consideration, the Mayor, in his unwavering loyalty to the nation, decided to resolutely stop them. Therefore, this order instructs the Bureau to immediately comply, and in conjunction with the Social Affairs Bureau, promptly abolish the said associations and report the handling status for verification. This is a crucial order."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Remarks: The current state of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee of all circles in this city seems to be close to a standstill. The industrial and commercial sectors have recently expressed their intention to withdraw. It is rumored that the Municipal Government also issued an order for its abolition yesterday. As this matter is of great importance, reporters specially interviewed Mayor Wu yesterday to inquire about the details. He replied as follows: "Since the September 18th Incident, with the country facing increasing difficulties, the public, driven by righteous indignation, rose up to engage in patriotic movements. Peaceful struggle is commendable, and the government would never forbid the people from being patriotic. However, in the current circumstances, the people should consider the nation's difficulties, ensuring that all actions remain within the bounds of law and order. This way, the government can continue to support the public while they advocate for their cause. Unfortunately, since its establishment, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee of all circles in this city has not followed legal procedures in its organization, and its actions have often exceeded the bounds of what is acceptable. Detaining goods and arresting people has repeatedly caused controversy. Their verdicts and punishments resemble those of a court. Moreover, the registration and confiscation of goods have been delayed for too long without resolution, causing deep distress to various chambers of commerce and trade associations, who have petitioned the government for relief. Various labor unions have also declared that such organizations only invite criticism and are insufficient for national salvation. The actions of the said Committee can be imagined. As the head of this city, during this critical period of national crisis, I must uphold the central government's authority and maintain overall stability as my sole responsibility. Shanghai is the financial hub of the country, and the lifeblood of industry and commerce. The Committee's actions, which have exceeded the bounds of what is acceptable, will inevitably affect order. To preserve local stability and social order, it is the government's duty to order its abolition. I have instructed the Public Safety and Social Affairs Bureaus to comply. In these difficult times, with the situation becoming increasingly severe, it is deeply regrettable that the actions of a patriotic organization have forced me to take such decisive measures. I only hope that the people of this country will become more vigilant and genuinely patriotic. Perseverance will eventually lead to success. Rushing into things impulsively will only lead to local chaos and national ruin. Patriotic actions taken in the wrong way will ultimately harm the country. I hope the media will urge the citizens to reflect deeply."</p>
<h3 id="e136">News of Various Organizations Withdrawing from the Abolished Anti-Japanese Association <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Over One Hundred Trade Associations Submit Documents: The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Trade Association, Yarn Trade Association, Seafood and Sundries Trade Association, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Trade Association, Medicinal Materials Trade Association, Hardware Trade Association, Coal Trade Association, Sausage Trade Association, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Trade Association, Cosmetics Trade Association, Cotton Cloth Trade Association, New Medicine Trade Association, Paper Trade Association, Southern Goods Trade Association, North-South Goods Exchange Trade Association, Rubber Hardware Vehicle Parts Trade Association, Sugar Trade Association, Department Store Trade Association, Seafood Shop Trade Association, Transportation Trade Association, Electrical Appliance Trade Association, Silk Fabric Trade Association, Flying Flower Trade Association, Coal and Stone Transportation Barge Trade Association, and over one hundred other trade associations submitted documents to the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting relief due to the mismanagement of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee of all circles in this city. (Omitted above) "Since the September 18th Incident, various sectors of this city, driven by righteous indignation, jointly organized the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee to engage in economic severance with Japan, which is indeed an important undertaking. However, the handling has not been entirely appropriate, leading to the resignation of various executive committee members in charge, weakening the organization day by day. Their actions have exceeded the bounds of what is acceptable, such as mistakenly detaining goods from various industries and arbitrarily suspending account books, which have been repeatedly negotiated but not yet returned. The amount of confiscated and registered Japanese goods is quite substantial, and there is still no way to dispose of them. With the year-end settlement period approaching rapidly, failure to provide prompt relief would seriously affect commercial stability. We have previously jointly petitioned the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee of all circles, setting a deadline for handling the matter. However, many days have passed without a response. In addition to informing the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to notify all business representatives to withdraw from the association, we respectfully submit this petition to your government for review. We hope that you will consider the importance of relieving the financial panic and strive to maintain stability. At the same time, we request that the Public Safety Bureau be ordered to effectively protect the confiscated goods in the various warehouses of the association in order to safeguard commerce."

Under this unreasonable oppression, the people of our country can only rely on perseverance and seek a calm response. Impulsive actions alone cannot achieve national salvation. Various so-called anti-Japanese national salvation organizations and other similar organizations have sprung up, but in reality, the vast majority of the public have little opportunity to participate and contribute, resulting in a counterproductive outcome. We are deeply saddened. Learning from past mistakes, we will unite under the leadership of the Shanghai General Labor Union to plan for national salvation and devise fundamental solutions. Compatriots from all walks of life, let us work together."</p>
<p>Middle School Anti-Japanese Association Petitions the Municipal Government: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Middle School Students in this city held an executive committee meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday. After the meeting, all executive committee members, including Wu Yuankan from Fudan Middle School, Xie Jinbiao from Shanghai Jiangwan Middle School, Yang Xikun from Shanghai Middle School, and Xiao Sizhi from Pudong Middle School, totaling fourteen people, went to the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM to petition. Their five demands were as follows: (1) Oppose the Municipal Government accepting the Japanese consulate's protest; (2) Release the workers arrested for anti-Japanese activities; (3) Guarantee the permanent public existence of anti-Japanese organizations; (4) Oppose the Municipal Council dissolving anti-Japanese organizations; (5) Oppose the Municipal Council closing down Chinese media outlets. As Mayor Wu and Secretary-General Yu were both away on official business, Guan Gong and Xiang Risi received them in turn. The group insisted on meeting with the Mayor or Secretary-General and persisted for a long time without success. They finally dispersed at 6:15 PM.</p>
<p>Meeting Report of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association (Datong News Agency):</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this city held a continuous series of executive and standing committee meetings yesterday after the staff first held a meeting. The details are as follows: (1) Staff Meeting: The internal staff of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association convened a joint meeting yesterday morning. As a result of the discussion, Yang Haichang, Cai Liansheng (Inspection Department staff), Ju Zhengqiu, Hui Quan (Secretariat), Luo Deming, Jin Xiaodong, Wang Jinwu (Intelligence Department), Xie Hezong (Investigation Department), and Lü Zhongyuan (Propaganda Department) were appointed to go to the Postal Labor Union to find Standing Committee member Lu Jingshi and inquire about his intentions. At the same time, a notice was issued to all staff: "For notification: According to rumors, this association is facing closure. Whether this is true has not been confirmed. In order to maintain the situation and demonstrate the spirit of anti-Japanese resistance, all staff members are hereby notified to come to the association as usual and not to lightly believe rumors and cause unnecessary panic. Printed by the United Staff Association of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association." (2) Standing Committee Meeting: After the representatives dispatched by the staff met with Standing Committee member Lu Jingshi, Lu instructed all staff members to work with peace of mind and promised to take responsibility for convening a standing committee meeting. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the meeting was convened on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Compatriots Association in Shanghai. The standing committee members present included Chu Huiseng, Yu Hualong, Fang Jiaobo (substituting for Chu Huiseng), Hu Fengxiang, Li Yongxiang, and Lu Jingshi. They first discussed the unresolved cases of confiscated Japanese goods and detained traitors. Therefore, the officials Liu Xiaochen, Bo Zipei, and Yang Xiangyun, who had been detained by the association for several days, were released, and the confiscated Japanese goods were unsealed, but only on the condition that the company publish an apology to the association in the newspaper. Next, they discussed the issue of the Anti-Japanese Association itself. Due to the gravity of the matter, it was postponed to the subsequent executive committee meeting for discussion and was therefore not discussed. (3) Executive Committee Discussion: At 5:00 PM last night, the executive committee meeting was convened. The executive committee members present included Wang Hanliang, Yu Hualong, Zhang Zilian, Zhang Yichen, Hu Fengxiang, Chu Huiseng, Zhu Xuefan, Wang Zhuping, Chen Peide, Wang Changyuan, and over thirty others. Chu Huiseng presided over the meeting, with Cao Zhigong and Tong Yikang as the recorders. They immediately discussed various external rumors and unreasonable demands from the Japanese side. After discussing until about 8:00 PM, they all agreed that the Anti-Japanese Association was initiated due to the Liaoning Incident and was a consistent demand of the people nationwide. As long as the Liaoning Incident is not resolved, the Anti-Japanese Association will continue to exist. Therefore, they should continue to work hard and carry out anti-Japanese national salvation work. As for the rumors that the Municipal Government has accepted demands from the Japanese side, they will wait for an official order from the Municipal Government. Changing the name of the Anti-Japanese Association is acceptable, but its goals and purpose are deeply engraved in the minds of the people and will not change. Secretary Cao Zhigong was then instructed to draft a circular instructing all staff members to carry on their work as usual. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>Meeting Report of the Shanghai County Anti-Japanese Association: The Shanghai County Anti-Japanese Association held its fifth plenary session of the Executive and Supervisory Committees yesterday morning in Beiqiao. Twenty committee members attended, chaired by Jiang Yanchou and recorded by Chen Guoan. After the formal procedures, the following items were discussed: (1) How the association should respond to the unreasonable demands made by the Japanese to the Municipal Government. The resolution was: (A) The Japanese forcibly demanding the cessation of anti-Japanese activities should be reported to the central government for severe rejection. (B) Volunteer troops should be organized as soon as possible for self-defense. (C) The county government should be requested to order the Public Security Bureau to step up precautions. (D) The Municipal Council should be questioned about the reasons for closing the Republic Daily newspaper. (E) All anti-Japanese associations in various regions should be notified by telegram to intensify their work. (2) Zhang Zuoxiang willingly colluded with foreigners and dared to publicly telegraph Jilin Acting Chairman Chen Yun, advising him to adopt a policy of non-resistance and surrender the territory. The association should issue a serious warning to him and ask Chairman Chen to fight to the end. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned.</p>
