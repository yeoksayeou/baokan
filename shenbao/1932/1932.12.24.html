<h3>馮占海部之西退</h3>
<p>據日昨報載。東北義勇軍馮占海部。與日寇相持經年。轉戰萬里。彈盡援絕。不得已率師西退。渡江之日。將士對個人眷屬。事前未能逃回顧内者。携行旣不可能。遺棄恐被敵辱。率多手刎嬌妻愛子。揮淚西行。道經遼西荒野之區。又値十室九空之際。兼程而進。併日不得一飽。此一篇記載。誠爲一字一血。一字一淚。不堪卒讀。嗚呼。人世間悲壯慘痛之事。固尙有逾於此者耶。　　我國東北三省。自强寇突發。負責衛國守土之軍隊。全師引退而後。其。賴以支持危局。保我民族精神於埀絕者。則惟我餉械兩缺之義勇軍。以其赤手空拳。轉戰於氷天雪地。使强敵氣沮。叛逆色變世界人士。都爲之刮目相看。其忠勇壯烈。堅苦卓絕。實足以動天地而泣鬼神。然而苦戰迄今。歷時雖已逾載。我義軍終以後援不繼。敵人砲火。有增無已因此而漸呈不支之勢。若馬占山。若蘇炳文。旣已先後敗挫。通集一隅。若馮占海部。今又不免以彈盡援絕而西退。嗚呼。一隅苦鬭。舉國坐。視若越視秦。漠不關心。義軍之敗挫果爲伊誰之罪歟。　　此次三中全會閉會宣言中有曰「本黨之責任爲求中國之自由平等。以鞏固國家領土主權行政之完整。苟有侵犯及於此者。誓與國人以全力抵禦而恢復之。」此種昭示。固斬釘截鐵。爲全國人民所共仰。夫我國自東省失陷而後。迄今歷時已逾一載。吾人固始終盼望政府有收復失地之準備。百又慮此種盼望之不易見諸事實。今政府於民氣將就消沉之時。乃忽有此種昭示。誠足使我人民爲之一振。竊謂今日禦禍之急務。第一步對於東北艱苦奮鬭之義勇軍。應即予以切實之援助。使忠勇之國民。不至徒仰天澶血。致歎於救國之無從。繼起者亦因膽壯而有以自奮。即此一端。已足以伸正義於兩間。　　抑尤有令吾人深感痛心者。義軍苦戰關外。迄今經年。冰天雪地。出死入生。而國内人民則燕嬉自若。當馮部手刎嬌妻愛子揮淚西行之日。正都市豪富之公子小姐燈紅酒綠酣歌醉舞之時。國未亡而人心先死。如燕巢飛幕而不自危。在此兩兩比較之下。吾人惟有疾聲呼天而已。國人乎。今日而猶望我民族得救。我中華民國不爲敵人鐵蹄所踏遍乎。則從今日起。唯有竭我全民族之力。充分援助義軍。使東北三省。敵人不能安坐而得。吾人須知今日衛我民族之武力。實在於民衆武力之義軍。救義軍即以救民族。亦即所以自救。國人乎。其速醒。</p>

<p>國民社二十一日華盛頓電　戰債問題現已完全留歸民主黨政府辦理、今日美總統已宣稱、渠與當選總統羅斯福兩人間之合作行動、業已終止羅氏旣認爲未便同意於渠之建議、渠將尊重羅氏之意旨、又政府某大員亦聲稱、總統在餘剩任期内、將不再進行戰債事件、美政府作此聲明後、隨即發表兩總統往來電文、最初胡佛於十七日致電羅斯福、撮述其選派兩黨委員團之計劃、並詢羅氏是否願於加入選派此項委員團、抑欲將全部戰債問題、延至三月四日以後辦理、羅氏接電後、當即商諸本黨各要人、據聞民主黨要人認此計劃、乃共和黨欲騙誘民主黨接受共和黨計劃與一共和黨委員團解决戰債之計、於是羅斯福遂在十九日覆稱、竊意足下亦將認余在按照憲法完全無預聞權力之時、接受一顯似共同之責任、將爲不智之圖、翌日胡佛又電羅斯福懇其合作、並請指派楊格或好斯或其他民主黨人、會同政府官員商取可以避免延遲之法、據共和黨稱、此種提議乃欲請民主黨派一代表、非正式協同内閣、决定選派委員團與應取步驟事宜、白宮方面逆料此議當能爲民主黨所接受、故有昨日之樂觀語、詎料傍晚即接羅斯福覆稱、余若接受共同責任、勢將使債務國及其他國家解釋爲余已受有照行已定政策與途徑之任務、深恐將來談判之際、甚致在債務以外事件、債務國或者亦將企圖使新政府受有現在行政人員所建議或同意者之拘束、但仍有倘將目下預備談判之進行狀况、隨時見吿、至爲銘感、而在此期間、余亦甚樂自由貢獻意見等語、胡佛總統接電後、知戰債問題旣非在剩餘任期内所能解决、而共和黨會同民主黨製定談判方針與解决建議之計劃、又不得行、憤恚之餘、遂有無意進行之表示、蓋戰債問題之解决、與美國大銀行家大實業家之關係至鉅、故民主黨欲俟柄政後自行解决、而共和黨則又不願恝然捨棄、日前國會之定欲債務國照償十二月到期欵、表示胡佛停付計劃業已期滿終止、與最近美總統之不欲經由尋常外交途徑而謀另組委員團、及國會之竭力反對此舉、羅斯福之一再宣言宜由尋常外交途徑辦理等、均爲此故、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日紐約電　胡佛總統對於羅斯福關於戰債之文件、認爲羅氏不允合作、羅氏聞之、表示訝異、乃發表一文、謂胡佛總統今竟發表一種暗示、以爲余對於在外國問題上之合作行爲、認爲不應予以同意、此舉誠爲可惜、不僅不利於本國、且爲不利於世界問題之解决、實則余向胡佛建議、胡佛可選出其代表作初步研究、而以其進行相示、余並允於今後及三月四日以前與胡佛總統商榷一切云、</p>

<h3>三中全會閉幕後孫科伍朝樞等昨日返滬</h3>
<p>孫伍均謂全會之印象甚佳</p>
<p>孫就立法院長就職期未定</p>
<p>伍表示不願擔任駐美公使</p>
<p>并談國人應洗去依賴心理</p>
<p>三中全會業已閉幕、出席中委紛紛離京、昨晨八時、由京乘夜車返滬者、有中委孫科·伍朝樞·張惠長·陳策·陳慶雲·梁寒操·崔廣秀·李任仁·關素人·張定璠·鄧靑陽·潘雲超·李綺庵·蕭吉珊·楊虎·錢大鈞·等、本報記者、昨晨訪晤孫伍兩氏、對全會之印象、以及内政外交諸問題、均有談及、孫表示允就立法院長、伍謂對司法行政部長已堅决辭謝、亦不願就駐美公使、至外交委員會委員長、及其他各職、尙待考慮云、茲分述如下、</p>
<p>（孫談全會印象）孫氏下車後、逕返哥倫比亞路私邸、本報記者、於昨晨十時許、前往晉謁、比蒙延見、孫氏首述個人對於今次三中全會印象甚佳、各方均能實行精誠團結、通力合作之精神、故三全會之結果、第一點可表示國民黨内意見之一致、集中於對外救亡、第二點凡議决各案、均可以代表黨内整個之意見、及全體國民所熱烈要求者、甚望將來能以政府與民衆合作之力量、促其一一實現、記者旋詢以粤方如何、有無特殊意見、據謂、粤方對全會决議、亦甚表好感、</p>
<p>（蔣軍委長希望）記者叩以蔣軍事委員長之觀感如何、答稱、蔣先生今次之態度極爲誠懇、尤其對於憲政之準備問題、盡量希望促其早日實現、當時頗有一部份非議、均經蔣詳爲解釋始已、</p>
<p>（試行憲政初規）孫氏又謂、全會議决於明年内召集之國民參政會、係中央之民意機關、爲訓政時期中試行憲政之初規、然行政最高之權力、仍在於中執會、俟二十四年三月國民大會召集時、始實行制定憲法、組織民權政府、實行眞正民治、</p>
<p>（中俄商訂條約）中俄現已正式宣吿復交、至中俄不侵犯條約、及通商條約等、均須俟互派大使到任後、再行商訂、顔惠慶先生使俄已得對方同意、俟中政會通過後、即可正式發表、至蘇俄之駐華大使、聞由前駐波斯大使調任、</p>
<p>（國防確定計劃）關於國防問題、全會中亦有極詳盡之討論、軍事委員會亦有詳細計劃報吿、對於航空之擴展、均議有確定辦法、惟事關軍事、未便發表、至海軍建設問題、以需欵過鉅、且人才訓練、亦非短時期所能奏效、故祇能就海防必需上、逐漸補充、</p>
<p>（蔣將赴贛勦匪）關於剿匪問題、豫皖鄂殘匪徐向前賀龍部竄入陜境、不久當可剿滅、惟江西赤匪猖獗、聞蔣先生將親往督剿、軍事指揮統一後、當易於肅清也、</p>
<p>（變更省府制度）此次全會議决取消省政府委員制、改爲省長制、蓋實行省長制、可使省長職權集中、責任旣專、辦事較易、另一方面設立省參議會、以爲地方民意機關、參預省政之改革、與夫都督省長、以免流於個人獨裁、至省參議會亦爲訓政期中過渡性質之民意機關、而憲政期中之民意機關、則爲省民大會、全會僅議决變更省制之原則、至詳細規定辦法、統由中政會中討論决定、</p>
<p>（决就立法院長）本人决就立法院長、何日赴京就職、尙未確定、各院部長並無十分更動、記者詢汪先生最近有返國消息否、據答、汪先生仍未恢復康健、尙須繼續休養、暫無返國之訊云云、</p>
<p>（伍朝樞氏表示）本報記者、於昨晨九時、訪晤伍朝樞氏於其寓邸、歸納伍氏談話之要點、㈠今次三中全會結果極爲圓滿、各種决議案、均爲目下我國最切要之圖、㈡本人之出處問題、外間頻有種種揣測、各方希望本人擔任外交委員會日委員長、或駐美公使、或司法行政部長、余對司法行政部長已堅决辭謝、駐美公使余亦不願就、究竟擔任何項職務、尙在考慮中、㈢中俄復交、爲我國外交應循之途徑、然國人苟以依賴國聯、依賴美國之心理、依賴蘇俄、則結果仍是失敗、蓋外交之勝利、完全在於自强、甚望國人洗去依賴心理、團結一致、努力自救云云、</p>

<p>自由談	萌芽（二）  杜衡　　父親從梯子上爬下來對兒子證了一眼。「你多嘴！」　　然而這一次確實是例外，父親沒有動手打，輕輕地駡一句就完事、　　小阿毛有一副祗有父親壓服得下的脾氣，他從來不肯吃一點兒虧。而今天，「小妖精」駡了他，他却沒有回駡；他來不及，「小妖精」是，據他想，沒命地逃了。於是，一邊重新慢慢地抽風箱，一邊在對自己說：「你敢出來！你敢出來！」他想像「小妖精」是怕他，纔稍稍覺得有點滿意　　誰說别人眞怕他，她終於又出現了。　　「不要走近來！」耐不住，小阿毛又多嘴。　　那一個顯然地改變了戰略，她自己笑着，不睬他；那種笑，不用說，是不屑理會的笑法。她站得很遠，然而不走開。她有時瞧瞧他，撅撅嘴，自己咿咿唔唔地唱起來。唱什麽，小阿毛一點也不懂得，不過他覺得是在駡他。　　小阿毛底眼睛是深的，他眼睛裏冒着火，死命地釘住了「小妖精。」　　停一會，「小妖精」拿出了一個又紅又大的橘子來自己吃，吃時嘴裏照樣咿唔着，顯然在吃給他看。　　小阿毛禁不住嚥了口瀺吐；「橘子臭的！」他對自己說。　　橘子吃完一個又一個，眞多。可是這一回却不吃，拿在手裏玩，一會兒在空中抛，一會兒在地下滾。突然間，那女孩子把弄得爛熟了的橘子遞到小阿毛身邊來。　　「把了你吧！」　　這可把他怔住了；旣而又一遍對自己說，「臭的！」他不伸手。　　「眞的把了你，我自己吃不下。」　　橘子底香氣獨着了他底鼻子。他看看那女孩子，又看着父親。　　父親說：「眞把你，你就拿吧。」　　小阿毛慢呑呑地伸出手去，他覺得有點不好意思。　　那一個看見他一伸手，便出人意外地笑了起來。她用手指羞着臉。「橘子是我的，你想不！」　　銅匠阿發一聽到這話出停下了生活。而我们底小阿毛更是一秒鐘都耐不得；他漲紅了臉，從風箱邊跳起身。「小妖精，老子要吃你的臭橘子！」他駡着。不夠，把橘子搶到手裏，使勁地向地上摔，還舉起小脚來把牠踏得個粉碎　　而「小妖精」自然也有她底辦法：她很現成地哭起來。　　「他搶我底橘子！他打我！」　　那一天事情就是這樣地經過的。　　結果，銅匠阿發給呌了到裏面去；好一會，他纔出來。出來之後他一句話也不對兒子說，祇掮起了他底那副吃飯傢伙就走。　　小阿毛在後面跟着。他把剛纔發生的一切都忘記了，他害怕。從爹爹底那行動和臉色上，他是嗅到了形勢底嚴重的。他一下子竟想逃走，然而他沒有逃；他還是在後面跨三步跑兩步地跟着。　　一到家，失去一個多年的老主顧的懊喪使父親隨手拿起了一根木棍子就想打。　　兒子用深的眼光瞅住他父親。　　可是今天眞奇怪，父親一看到兒子底那一對眼睛就心軟了；他底手沒力而他底眼淚倒比木棍子先掉落到兒子底身上。　　「小阿毛！小阿毛！：：：」連聲地喊着。　　小阿毛本來是做了筋骨在等待父親底棍子的，他不打算哭；但是終於禁不住破例放聲大哭了起來。　　而從此，他便抵死也不肯再踏進有高門檻底牆門去；他不說所以然，這所以然是祗有他父親知道的。（完）說死以及自殺情死之類  郁達夫　　死是全部的生物必須經過的最後的一重門，但我們人類丨丨尤其是中國人丨丨彷彿對死這一件事情，來得特别的怕，因而在新年裏，在喜慶場等地方，大家都不敢提到這一個字，以爲不吉。其實我們人類是時時刻刻，日日年年，在那裏死下去的，今日之我，並非昨日之我，一刻前之我，當然不是現在的一刻之我了，死，怕　幹嗎？照英國裴貢（一五六一丨丨一六二六）說來，人對死的恐怖，是因見了臨終的難過，朋友的悲啼，喪葬的行列，與夫死相的難看等而增加，正如小孩的恐懼黑暗，會因聽了大人的傳說而增加一樣。偉大善良，有作用的人，是不怕死的。裴貢在他那篇論死的文章裏，并有還引了許多賽乃𠹍，該撒，在諾的話在那裏，敎人不要怕死，敎人須做好人，做事業，熱心於令名的流傳。但我想寫這一篇論文的裴貢自身，當傷了風，睡在他朋友家裏的冷床之上，到了將死的時候，一定也在那裏後悔的，後悔着不該去做那一回冰肉的試騐，致受了寒。哲人中間，話雖說得很透闢，年紀雖也活得相當的高，但對於死的恐怖，仍舊是避免不脫，到後來仍要去迷信鬼神的，很多很多。尤其年老的人，怕死更加怕得厲害，這只須讀一讀高爾基做的托爾斯泰的印象記，就可以曉得這位八十幾歲的老先生對死是如何的恐怖了。　　厭世哲學家愛杜華特，豐，哈爾脫曼，從科學的生物學的研究，而說到了人的不得不死。敎人時時刻刻記住，生是偶然，而細胞的崩潰，與肉體的死去，却是千眞萬確，沒有例外的。在這敎訓裏，當然是可以使智者見智，仁者見仁，並不是在說，人橫堅是要死的，還不如貓貓虎虎地過去一輩子就算了。反之，因感到了生也有涯，而知也無涯之故，加緊速力去用功做事業的人也不在少數，這原是死對人類的一種積極的貢獻。再退一步說，假使中國的各要人，都能想到最後是必有一個死在那裏等他的话話那從我們四萬萬窮苦同胞身上所校榨去的一百三十萬萬的公債，及不知幾千萬萬的租稅等，都不會變成私人的户頭，存到外國銀行裏去了。人是總有一死的，要昧盡天良，搜括這麽許多錢幹嗎？這豈不是死之一念，對人類的消極的貢獻？可惜中國人只在怕死，而沒有想到死的必不能避免。厭世哲學，從這一方面看來，我到覺得在中國還有大來提倡的必要。　　從厭世哲學裏，必然要演繹出來的結論，是　　自殺。善哉，叔本華之言，「自殺何罪」？人之所以比上帝厲害的地方，就在上帝要想自殺，也死不成功，（因爲神是永生的），而人却可以以他自己的意志，來解决自己的生命。旣然入世是苦，生存是空的時候，那自殺也不過是空中之空罷了，罪於何有？吃白食的宣敎師們說自殺是罪惡，全係空談，不通的立法者們，把自殺列入刑條，欲對自殺者加以重刑，尤其是滑稽得可笑。一個對死都沒有恐懼的人，對於刑律的威脅，還有一點什麽恐懼呢？　　不過自殺旣不是罪惡，而人生總不免一死的話，那直接了當，還不如大家去自殺去罷，倒可以免得許多麻煩。厭世哲學的眞義，是不　在這裏？這我想不但哈爾脫曼沒有說過，就是厭世哲學的老祖宗叔本華也不在那麽想的。否則像猴子似的這一位醜奴兒，何必要著他的「想像與觀念的世界」，何必要見英國時人貝郎而吃醋，何必要和他娘去爲爭財産而涉訟，何必要和一個同居的女裁縫師去打架呢？人之自殺　蓋出於不得已也，必定要精神上的苦痛，能勝過死的時候的肉體上的苦痛的時候，纔幹得了的事情。若同吃茶喝酒一樣，自殺是那麽便利快樂的話，那受了重重壓迫的中國民衆，早就個個都去自殺了，誰還願意去完糧納稅，爲幾個軍閥要人做牛馬呢？無相庵隨筆  施蟄存　　郁達夫擱筆已久，今年忽復努力。避成西湖經月，頗有新作，撰述之餘，又爲其夫人寫屏聯甚多。昨過其齋頭，見一條幅，寫新作一絕句云：「一路溪山曲又灣，秦亭廻望更清閒，沿途都是靈官殿，合共君來住此間。」似頗有鹿車高隱之志矣。、　　昨在北四川路，見一麗人，似曾相識者，尋思有間，始憶爲昔年同學。與余在經濟學，哲學概論及英文三科爲同班。校刋上曾刋伊新詩，有「願天下的悲哀，都歸我担受」之語，頗有救世主基督之精神。余與之相稔，則在寒假歸里時，適同車，遂有傾談之機會，妙語靈心，固頴慧人也。未終業，聞隨父母之粤，遂不復能一晤，余曾製南浦念之曰　　『柔春暮雨，渺愔愔心緒惜瓊華，銀笛聲聲初冷，吹夢走天涯，小檻似聞幽嘆，有將離苦壓鬆雲斜，算舊情應憶，麝蘭飛座，殘照駛車，此去侵簾寒月，對羅浮無計不思家，淚滴鶑花餘恨，愁眼太嬌些。料峭細風庭院，灑相思萬點付啼鴉，騰畫屏孤館，飄蕭詞鬢獨摩娑。』綺語難删，舊文人結習未除也。然而今日之足供回念者，亦幸有此一詞耳。　徐霞村曩年在上海，鬰鬰不得志，遂　　去北平，大有杜老投荒之意。劉呐鷗創第一綫書店於寳興路口，屬余主持其事，一夕，霞村來閒話，興會颷舉，時電燈未裝設，燃燭，將見䟦矣，而意未闌，余忽思飲，攫一壼自在叩老虎灶門。及返，霞村俟之門外，門設耶爾鎖，已扃矣。鑰匙在室内，無從得啓，二人俱單衣，寒甚。余遂急雇車至江灣路劉呐鷗寓，取得鑰匙，至則霞村方就壼作鯨飲，蓋寒不可勝矣。八門，燭方燼，幸免於祝融之厄。近者霞已娶於北平，想無復當年浪漫情緒，不審讀此後，亦念及海上故人否。世界最大的房屋  湜　　我們曉得世界最高的房屋在美國，但世界最大的房屋在那裏呢？也在美國。這就是美國阿克隆軍港的飛機庫。這個飛機庫，門面有二十二丈，深三十二丈，高二十二丈，中設鐵道，以便搬運飛機，裏面可以容納比齊伯林飛艇還要大的飛船二艘。電氣廣吿的構造  麗蘋　　在晚上，當我們走到上海熱鬧的地方時，我們一定要讚嘆那些華美的燈光，那些艷麗的電炬罷。　　商人們爲着要使他們的商務發達，便不得不利用新奇的廣吿術，而電氣廣吿乃應運而生。那末電氣廣吿究竟是怎樣構造的呢？現在此作一簡單的介紹。　　先將玻璃管的兩端裝置電極，内部眞空，然後灌入少量的Ｎeon瓦斯（化學符號爲Ｎe）。其分量以玻璃管的大小長短而定。在此封有Ｎeon瓦斯的玻璃管中，通以高壓電流，其電流通過之處，瓦斯乃發光而放異彩。普通多爲紅色。它不像電燈泡似的以一條紅熱的細絲發光，而是冷的Ｎeon瓦斯的獨特的發光。倘若在那裏面灌入少許的水銀蒸氣，便成靑色　再將水銀蒸氣量增加，玻璃管爲黃色便發綠色的光耀。　　普通所稱爲Ｎeonsign的，有各種式樣，如在招牌或廣吿板上將玻璃管裝成文字或花紋的形式，然後在其中通入電流。然亦有不全用Ｎeon管，而將燈泡並用的。　　Ｎeon瓦斯係三十年前英國大化學家萊姆生所發明，至二十年前乃被利用爲電氣傳導體。然其量甚少，約爲空氣的百萬分之十二，可是它的效用最大，只須消耗電泡的十分之一的電力，便能通過雲霧使遠地方的人都能見到。所以現在航空航海都利用它做標識，歐美各國的飛機塲，多半備有Ｎeon航空標識塔。談「自由談」  倚岡　　在這年頭，「自由談」在字，常會使人聯想到許多可怕的，毛骨爲之悚然的事情。　　譬如，連無聊到編「小故事」的勾當，也畢竟闖下了滔天大禍，這事情，應該大家還沒有忘記。假如再有人偶然說幾句良心上的實話，自然事情是更來得嚴重，聰明的人便立刻會從話裏嗅出「金盧布」的氣息，爲你戴上一頂玫瑰色的花冠。　　然而「人」，究竟是會適應環境的動物，「良心話」旣不可說，則南菲洲一百六十丈的大蛇，和五十磅的金鋼石，以及某前要人的第三十三位姨太太等，便天然的被檢去作爲最穩健最寳貴的題材。因爲這旣全不關什麽「良心話」之類，而蛇又可以使小姐哥兒們嚇得伸舌頭，鑽石可以使少奶奶們在晚上多做「個美麗的夢。再不然，便來一個「才子佳人」的大團圓罷，來一個「老五」「老六」的「渦」罷，來一個什麽「梅」什麽「菊」的𠼙音罷，：：：：：　　題目固不易找，說話的態度尤難！紳士派的腔調，「落」，篤人的口吻，「粗鄙」，感傷得小資産階級沒落的悲哀，激烈更會有人要你的腦袋。然而在這裏，會適應環境的「人」，他又會嘘一口輕微的氣，拖着哭笑都不是的長音，「嗚呼噫嘻，」說來了又說去，說去了又說來。　　這樣，才能「自由」，這樣才是「自由談」。　　我們這樣的「自由」這樣的「談」已不止一日了，然而「這樣」，到現在，似乎有點不同了，「老五」「老六」呀，我們更從何處尋覓「自由」的樂園呢？長篇創作時代与愛的歧路二十四  張資平　　當他們在海泉面前走過去時，他聽見曹世光這樣地對那個老先生說。世光好像忘記了海泉在這禮拜堂裏的存在了。　　風琴響了。哈巴牧師從講台右側的小門鑽出講台上來了。全堂的聽衆都立起身來唱讚美歌。　　哈巴牧師大概是看見今天的聽衆太少了，他一登台便說：　　『照本會的慣例，每次散會後略備茶點，欵待諸位。同時，諸位對於上帝的獻金，也要踴躍的捐助。前禮拜五，因爲本會裏發生了一點事故，來不及備茶點了。本會對諸位丨丨中國的兄弟們，實在是抱歉得很。今天仍然準備了茶點。不幸的是，因爲前禮拜沒有茶點，今天來會的中國兄弟便減少了。希望我們的熱誠的會友，下次要多拉些朋友來。以後定規有茶點了。决不失信的。』　　海泉聽見，幾乎要笑響聲了。他想，這是什麽話呢。原來白人眼中的中國信者是這樣的。難怪曹世光拚命拉我來，就是這個緣故。　　『廖先生，今天有多少兄弟到會的？』　　哈巴牧師望着剛才和曹世光說話的那位穿藍布棉袍的先生問。　　　　『女會友八個，男會友十七個。』　　『有新來者沒有？』　　『對了，男會友十六個，新來慕道的一個，林海泉先生。』　　海泉聽見這話後，急得滿在通紅。他恨曹世光何以就把自己的名字吿訴了他們。　　「那末，我們今天要歡迎新慕道者林先生喲。」　　哈巴牧師望着坐在下面的海泉微笑，也點了點頭。他接着又說：　　「可不可以請林先生上來把慕道的動機向我們會友報吿報吿？」　　海泉想，這不是綁票式的傳道麽？老曹太對不起人了，不得自己的同意，跑去向老番頭胡七道八。　　曹世光像接了聖旨般地飛跑到海泉面前來把嘴巴凑到他的耳朶上，海泉聞着一陣一陣的臭氣了。　　「請你上去隨便說幾句，看看我的面上。」　　「半點沒有準備，有什麽好說的？」　　「把你到敎會來的感想說一說就夠了。最好捧一捧敎會。」　　海泉躊躇了一忽，才下了决心般的站了起來。他想，在這敎會裏的會衆，大概都是沒有什麽智識的，隨便扯幾句，哄哄他們吧。</p>

<p>Page 19</p>
<p>（老婦）照我看來，人才是姓許的好，出落得風儀秀整，錦繡文才，配我們慧兒，可算得才子佳人，珠聯璧合，可惜家道清寒，總不是「門當户對」的角色，不像姓康的家財富有，可合古人說的「嫁女高三分」的一個條年，窮女婿是坍台的！所以我以爲雖則康少爺人才不及許家，但是還是他家來得相當，慧兒嫁過去，也可一世衣食無憂了。　　（老翁）不對不對！我曉得姓康的這位少爺，非但智識平平，並且聽說趾高氣揚，脾氣很歹，呼奴喝婢，完全是一個紈袴子弟的氣派，將來慧兒嫁過去，保不定要夫婦不睦！况且朋友與我說，這位少年，雖則年紀輕輕，倒已抽上了鴉片，犯了貽害自己終身，貽害妻子兒孫的大毛病，一天據說要吃四五塊錢，所以雖則他家産大，我倒不贊成招烟鬼子做女婿！還是姓許的好吧，講到貧富，雖則他和康家天錯地遠，但也并非家徒壁立，只要孩子爭氣，也窮不了一世的咧！　　（老婦）老爺，你的主意，太錯了，一個人活在世上，祗要豐衣足食就是，管怎麽智識學問，倘把慧兒嫁了姓許的窮小子，斷送她一身幸福，你想，她要怨嗎？不如嫁了姓康的，來得妥當，講到脾氣歹，我想除了窮小子，財主人家的少爺，個個是養尊處優慣的，那個不使性子，祗要慧兒有手叚，嫁過去也可尅制的。至於吃鴉片兩字，那更不在話下，俗語說的，「富家郎，吃上鴉片保家當，」他有了幾十萬家産，只憂他不吃鴉片，莫憂他消耗金錢，你想他有偌大的家産，吃三四塊錢一天，有怎麽希罕，老實說，一輩子也吃不窮了。所以我决定把慧兒嫁給姓康的做富家少奶奶。而不情願送給姓許的窮漢做黃臉婆！　　何老爺的爲人，本來也是頭腦陳舊，現在經了他夫人一番話，打動了他多金的心理，立刻交熾成一種欺貧重富的勢利觀念，而默然的應了一聲：一唔：：：：」　　（老婦）旣然你也允了，那末我等媒人來時，就請他關照男家，擇日文定好了。　　可憐何慧珠的一身幸福所繫的，命運泉源的，婚姻問題，就在她父母的陳舊的，拜金的，卑鄙思想中。傳統的，宗法觀念下，而判决了她的命運了。開會和茶點  光宜　　「開會」和「茶點」從表面上看起來，似乎是不相關的，然而倘使你能夠詳細觀察一下的話，包你立刻可以發見牠們的互相關聯，别的地方我不敢說！就拿我們學校而論，每個「集會」總和「茶點」是脫離不掉的，照例從振鈴開會直到大會閉幕，到了終結，總有：「附有精美茶點」這一套玩意兒，老實說，假使開會而沒有一項節目，也許在開會的時候，除了主席和委員以外，連半個鬼都沒有，這并非是過火之言，事實吿訴我們是如此的，　　記得那一天正是李頓報吿書發表的次日，天氣很好，太陽照得每個靑年的血管，都在那裏似乎爆裂了，國際政治研究會主席×君，他眞可憐！在這熱光的太陽下面，還要跑來跑去，喘氣似的找尋那些委員先生和會員，預備對於李頓報吿書加以深切的研究和討論，我們那位主席，他當然對於李頓報吿書是很有些研究的，我親眼看他把昨夜研究電影的餘暇，拿來研究報吿書，熄燈後點完了一枝洋燭纔睡，他眞可憐！多麽用功，　　開會的時間，是下午三點鐘，聰明的主席是研究過羣衆心理學的，曉得開會和茶點具有密切的關係，丨現在雖然是沒有茶點，但爲使開會順利起見，他在通吿單上還寫着：「附有精美咖啡茶點」這「咖啡茶點」還特别用紅字寫成，這也是研究羣衆心理學的好處呀！　　會是開了，除了委員和會員以外，非會員也都參加了，這樣的擁擠，幾乎把那××堂擠坍，自然　，有了茶點，萬事好辦，但，不幸得很，那是吹吿！一個騙人的玩意兒罷了，　　丨主席丨會是開了這些時候，肚子可有些在那兒呌了，我想最好請主席先把：：：厚嘴唇的×君立起來說道，　　丨那纔對呀！請主席最好：：：羣衆和觸似的反應着，　　丨茶點丨快些丨丨來了一陣吵鬧，可憐的主席，到了這時候，眞是上天無路，入地無門，喘氣似的說道：「諸位，對不起，今天本來是想豫備茶點的，只因人手不多，沒有買來，所以只好對不起了，下次補吃吧！：：：」　　丨怎樣？沒有茶點，騙老子丨你這×××丨丨來來，存心豫備來吃茶點的×君喊着，　　丨××丨茶點丨見鬼丨××丨丨　　於是在一頓臭駡之下，羣衆就一溜烟似的走開了，　　會場中只剩了我們那位可憐的主席，直對着報吿書在那兒發怔，到了後來，他也走了，於是這很熱鬧的大會，就此在一陣胡鬧之下壽終正寢，　　寫到這裏，我想聰明的讀者，總不會再否認「開會和茶點」是沒有關係的了，所以在此地，我忠吿一句，將來在無論什麽集會裏面，假使你要你們的會員齊到的話，再好你能夠照我上面所說的話一一去實行，包你能夠「少長咸集」，也許來個「羣賢畢　」，這確實是無可疑義的，聰明的讀者，對嗎，火燭小心？  張一萍　　天寒歲暮，每夜的西北風中已送來了「火燭小心」的口號。　　隔壁新搬進一家製造小兒炸藥的房客，弄内的人家對二房東警吿，不准這家房客搬進來。但是高貴的房價，扼住二房東的喉管，在「妥協」中這製作所終於居住下來。誰料不滿十天之内，發生了火災，二房東的嘗鐵窗風味，當然罪有應得。我們被延燒的損失，向誰去追償呢！　　是中飯時分，小孩子已跳上櫈子，歡迎那一桶香噴噴的白注飯從廚房内送出來。突然尖說的呼聲，送進了我的耳管；接着是雜亂的警笛聲。我急忙開了門，弄内的人家，都携老扶幼，拼命的向外奔去；年輕力壯的還掮上箱件雜物之内。我抬頭一看，隔壁的屋頂上，已冒起了火星，返身進内的時候，屋内大哭小喊；外邊更是警笛亂吹，忽然嘩喇喇的一聲響，似乎隔壁倒了一垜墻。屋内的人，都心慌意亂，有的拖了一條被頭；有的甚於捧着飯碗，向大門擠去。因爲我們一家，是在弄底，隔壁火勢高盛之後，再休想逃得出命去。我强自鎭靜住，咐吩家人先逃出去，自己跑上樓。不知那裏來的神力，扭斷床下的箱子上的鎖，捧了咱們家裏自以爲値錢的小箱子。跑出天井，我們的正樓上，火舌頭像幾百萬條蛇一樣，在窗隙間擇人而噬，我衝出大門，身上已着了火星，這時候救火車已到了。弄内即刻禁止行人起八，我不得已，避進前弄一家石庫門内，弄内人家差不多都是熟識的；我就跳上他們的曬臺，呌應了站在弄外露天的家人，恐怕他們以爲我葬身火窟。現在旣不能出去，靠在曬臺上就觀他們救火；但是這時風勢正盛，頃刻之間，我們的家都着了火，救火員握着皮帶管灌救；同時用利斧爬塌附近的墻壁，以防火勢蔓延。　　一點鐘之後，火勢全熄，共計延燒五家，我望着自己的家，大半倒在瓦礫塲中，所有餘存的東西，被救火員劈的劈，摔的摔，像搜尋什麽似的，到處亂翻。我靠在曬臺上，望望站在街心中，無處歸宿的男女老少，不禁悽然淚下。　　二房東爲了每月能多幾塊錢的房金，搬進了製造危險性的房客，使這五家内的人，流離失所（後來知道有兩人葬身火窟）已進捕房嘗鐵窗風味去了。但是救火人員，不應乘火打刦，把餘存的東西，儘量搜尋，要知道站在街頭的被難者，怎樣感謝着你們的灌救呢？但是你能說一句話嗎？我希望當局者體恤被難者的痛苦，對於救火人員相當的改善。如其這東西能刋出的話，更希望每天在西北風中，聽着「火燭小心」口號的時候，人人再細愣的向容易遺火種的地方檢查一下。小說寫信給友人之妻（十四續）  秦瘦鷗　　這時候，我的靈魂很愉快，我的精神也很興奮；因爲車過下關的時候，我已經用五片阿司匹靈，解决了我的寒熱病了。昨天晚上，我一個人喫了三塊牛排；不過，却不覺得是什麽滋味，像嚼了三方木塊一般。　　我這樣的努力加列餐，預計在出關之前，我儘有恢復我固有的壯健，和活潑的精神底希望了。至少限度，當我踏進義勇軍的隊伍中去的時候。我决不致連和日本獸軍拚命的力量也沒有了！　　我這一次出走的動機，在這裏已經是盡量的吿訴你了丨我是爲着要保全你的名譽，以及大經和小薔薇的幸福，而犧牲的；當然不能說是爲的愛國。但是，原因也不祇是這樣的單純：我要是眞沒有一些愛護祖國的意志，我要犧牲自已，跳黃浦還不是最容易，最乾脆的事情嗎？我何必要大兜圈子的上關外去求犧牲呢？　　唉！美麗的小猪玀！你對於我們這一個大中華民國的眞實情形，也許是狠糢糊吧？這也不能怪你。本來，大中華民國的女國民，原是天生的一具推銷洋貨的機器而已：除了考究裝飾之外，誰還注意過國家？也許現在是中華民國的第幾年，她們也不很清楚咧！　　現在，讓我吿訴你吧！小兄弟！我們這一個大中華民國實在是已經害了第三期的肺病了！如果政府依舊這樣的混沌湖塗，老百姓們也依舊這樣的驕奢淫佚，那末十年之内，要如靑天白日的國徽，還能夠在太陽光之下飛舞的話，我願意在下一世變頭烏龜給你瞧！　　單拿一二八上海之亂來講。倘若日本人這樣暴橫無理，蔑視友邦的巴戲，在别的國宾的疆土之内搬演出來的話，我敢保證在一二九的早晨，附近一帶的少年人，壯年人，必然的立即望戰地集中。不管日本獸軍的鎕砲怎樣犀利，飛機怎樣活躍，他們也必逞着勇氣，站在最前綫上；更不一定要拿到槍砲，就是一柄剌刀，一根木棍，也何嘗不可以前仆後繼的跟日本獸軍作一番殊死戰，寒寒敵人的胆氣啊！但是，當吳淞，江灣，閘北，先後在被攻擊，焚燒，屠殺，奸淫的時候，我們大中華民國的靑年人，壯年人，却紛紛齊望帝國主義翼護下的租界裏逃來；集中起來，看影戲，嫖堂子，叉麻將，打撲克，甚至還有許多更不要臉的傢伙，竟會作樂得忘記了時候，打過十一點鐘，還在馬路上逗留，給洋鬼子們大批的捉進捕房去。　　像這樣沒廉恥，無血性的民族，怎樣能在不競則滅的時代裏生存呢？</p>

<p>電影專刊海外異聞保羅博士恩自殺的索隱  凛　　金髮女郎琪恩哈羅的丈夫保羅博恩ＰaulＢern於與琪恩結婚兩月後，突然以手槍擊入自己腦中而自戕。此消息傳出後，非但好萊塢爲之震驚，全世界亦極訝異，如美聯通信社，亦爲之特發專電數次。但保羅之死，原因至今未明，據云琪恩自己，亦覺莫名其妙，或知之而諱莫如深。故世人但知保羅之自殺，而莫由探悉其自殺之故，而此疑案亦恐將隨保羅而長埋於地下矣』『近好萊塢有星象家大理歐Ｓareos者，自謂已探得保羅自殺之故。大理歐非但專長於星象的探索，並且係一位大精神學者，他說他已於保羅與琪恩未結婚之前數月即已知此事。有一天保羅來訪問這位大星象家，據云這時保羅腦中已種有自殺之根。保羅心極忠厚，腦筋靜穆而時有種種幻想，盤踞其中。保羅的思想傾向於神學方面者甚深，並極信今世能作善事，於來世必多善果』『保羅深愛琪恩，而他犧牲的精神，實無人能加以制止。他深信琪恩將來必爲偉大的女伶，但她現在還沒有得到相當的經歷，她的天才，還在睡夢之中，需有一絕大的剌激，然後可以將　的天才驚醒。但倘能留一極大的創㾗，於她的腦海之中，必定可使她將一生悲歡離合的經歷，發爲可歌可泣的著作，而琪恩之將來，或者可與杜賽及彭那德齊名矣。保羅曾將此意吿諸大理歐，並自謂在此世界的使命已經完成：云云。後保羅自殺的消息傳出，大理歐深深歎了一口氣，所以就决定了保羅的自殺，實係爲琪恩將來起見，而有此大無我的犧牲云。大理歐的精神學，係好萊塢素來信仰的，所以他的論斷，衆亦信之不疑云。　　今天晚上，從北冰洋坐了鹿車來到各國的聖誔老人。你不用到公司裏去買，這裏我先送你一箇。隨便談談電影界之作風問題  毁尊　　一個文學家，有他的作風；一個藝術家，也有作風；同樣的，一個電影演員，一顆亮晶晶地明星，也有一個明星的作風。珍妮蓋諾的嬌小玲瓏；麥克唐納的富麗堂皇；瑙瑪希拉的風騷入骨；希佛來的風流俊俏，范朋克的英雄壯士，：：：說不盡，數不清，好萊塢的明星，他們都有各個的作風。　　我們中國的明星，似乎從沒有給我們這樣一個概念。比如問：胡蝶的作風怎樣？阮玲玉的作風怎樣？金熖，鄭小秋，龔家穠，陳玉梅：：等等的作風，又是怎樣？那我們就狠難說出一個答案，因爲他們什麽角色都能扮的，鄉下姑娘，摩登小姐，學生名媛，蕩婦小星，紳士貴族，販夫走卒，英雄壯士，公子哥兒，件件能扮，色色都行。所以，他們的作風，我們就無從領略了。　　一件事情成爲專門，就易於出色；一個明星形成了一種作風，也就易於顯其所長。但要造成一種作風，就要有極精密的觀察。導演對於演員，要看出他們的天才所在，而給他們在劇本中適當的角色。演員自己呢，也擇劇本中合於自己才能的角色來充當。這樣，而明星的作風，也就可以製造了出來。楊柳靑之死  寄病　　楊女士　杭州世家女也，因情塲之失意，曾一度自殺被救，後悄然來滬投身影界。第一次入天星未成復由謝靑萍君介紹加入大中。此次隨大中赴蘇攝外景，殊料娟娟此豸，竟死於「孤軍」之役。　　大中離滬前最後一次之歡叙係在新雅，楊女士及本公司職演員共十二人觥籌交錯，談笑至歡，席未及半忽有新進女星某，翩然蒞至，將列席人數凑成十三，是時魏秀寳雖有電話，謂不久即來，然候至席散，不見駕到，於是十三之數，無法更變矣。　　其後楊柳靑自天平山受傷即由公司中人抬至更生醫院，關室診治，周世勛最先發現病房之號亦爲十三，因西俗以十三爲大不吉，默而未言，孰知此雙雙十三，竟眞爲不幸之預兆耶？一個建議加映七點鐘班  菲　　現在的一般影戲院，除了極少數的幾家之外，大概每天只映三點，五點半，九點一刻三班，我覺得對於觀衆極不便利，尤其是現在冬天。譬如說九點一刻的一班，散塲的時間要在十一點多，觀衆從暖和的劇塲裏，跑到寒冷的街上，受着冷風的吹擊，一定是很受不住的。又譬如五點半的一班，去看的人往往要牲犧了一頓晚飯，像我們學生就是如此。所以我提議請許多影戲院都能加映七點鐘班，那末我們吃罷了晚飯去看，散塲的時間又並不遲，非常便利，於影戲院的營業方面恐怕也要好一點呢！銀幕上接吻的經騐  康冰　　泥爾海密爾頓ＮeilＨamilton自從攝製影片以來，曾和六十七個女子接吻過，這意思也就是說，他已懂得六十七種接吻的方法。他非常的精於此道，據他說，曾經和他接吻過的這許多女子中，以瓊克勞馥最爲婉轉，海倫海絲最有眞實性。　　泥爾海密爾頓說，接吻並不是一件容易做到的事情，當她和瑙瑪希拉在ＳtrangersＭayＫiss一片表演的時候，他心裏很是擔心地想着，因爲瑙瑪是他主人柴爾伯ＴhalＢerg的妻子啊！所以他非常地拘束，不敢十分放肆，然而因此他卻被瑙瑪嘲笑了一回。　　他說；「和瓊克勞馥接吻，最快樂她是非常地婉轉，和她吻的時候，她更是熱烈地顫動。這似乎近於放浪，但是瓊的態度是光明磊落，無可懷疑的。」　　他又說「吻曼麗白萊ＭaryＢrian是另予人一種感覺。她是非常地率眞絲毫沒有虚僞的。」　　關於海倫海絲ＨelenＨayes他說「她是最有眞實性了，她的眞情流露，簡直使人神魂飛越。而在另一方面的琵琵妲娓兒，和她接吻卻是絕少具有眞情。她旣不能似瓊克勞馥那樣地婉轉，又缺乏海倫海絲那般的眞情。而她的接吻，完全是戲劇性的。」　　海密爾頓夫人，是一個寬客而快樂的女子她眼見着丈夫在銀幕上擁抱着豔麗的女子吻着，她一些兒也不嫉妒。　　假如您的嬸嬸，係一位大胖子，而您送了一個少女的兜胸，您可以想您嬸嬸接受那禮物的時候，神氣是怎麽樣的。聯華又受政治牽制  明　　宣傳已久之「三個登女性」因末一幕大罷工剌激力甚大，恐遭中央電檢會之不滿，於是被剪八百尺，末一幕改用暗寫重攝，以致佈景重置，而以前四百餘演員之一大叚完全犧牲，今已送京檢許，二十九日起映云，本埠珍聞一位未來的女星  靑霞　　夏佩珠，她是個活潑玲琍的姑娘；芳齡二八，容貌秀麗，酷肖胡蝶；性情温柔，爲人和藹可親，今肄業於法租界華童公學。天資聰頴，平時沈默寡言：她自進了該校，從不曾請過一次假，也不會有一回遲到，除了在不得已時之外；她對於求學，是怎樣的重視，我們已可從想象中得之了；並且很是崇尙儉約，絕無時下摩登派之習氣。她是誰？她就是夏佩珍的妹妹丨夏佩珠。　　她很有志於電影；她更企圖她夠能立刻現身銀幕；因爲她的姊姊丨夏佩珍丨每逢從外埠拍攝外景回來，總譚着那裏的風景，是怎樣的優秀動人；並且到了月底，還拿着一大捲的鈔票丨薪水丨回家：所以在她腦海的一角裏，已印着一種深刻的印象；「拍影戲是多有趣的一回事呵！」　　她嘗幾次要求家庭准她去拍戲，不過屢次均遭拒絕；心有餘力不足，未能如償宿願，這也使她感覺到萬分的懊惱和不快。　　最近，據說她已得家庭之許可，在華童公學卒業之後允准她從事電影，所以近來她喜形於色，喜歡得不了。電影專著「受寵若驚」的榮幸  陳大悲　　在攝影塲裏，每一個鏡頭，拍攝之前，導演乾必先命演員們練習一遍。經他認爲滿意之後，方纔發開機命令。不論在那一種攝影塲裏，這種程序差不多全是一律的。　　導演的性情各有不同。但是對於認爲不滿意的表情無論那一種導演斷不能夠糊裏糊塗的命攝影師開機拍攝的。導演以爲你這樣的表情不合適，而且明明白白地指出你的不合適諸點來。你那時候如果對於自己的表情始終不知道到底是甚麽樣子，最簡單，最笨拙而又最普通的方法就是你對導演聯續的變換出各種各樣的表情來，任憑他選擇一種。每一種試出的時候，導演搖搖頭，你便感到非常的恥辱。幸而試到最後一種，導演認爲滿意了。而你也感到『受寵若驚』了。但是臨到電光師配足了光綫，攝影師搖動了機輪的時候，你的臉上有一根不隨意的筋突然的跳舞起來，你的心理好像突然受到了壓迫，做出的表情竟和剛纔試給導演看過而且被認爲滿意的表情距離了一百八十碼，於是乎導演突命停機，燈光全熄，你的心裏作何感想？這是誰的錯誤？導演責備你。你去責備誰呢？</p>

<p>(Beiping) After Su Bingwen's army retreated into Russian territory, the Japanese military aggression in North Manchuria came to an end, and their sights gradually turned to Rehe. The 9th and 8th Divisions have already been transported from Heilongjiang to the Suizhong area, and a light railway is being built from Suizhong to a certain place on the Rehe border in preparation for invading Rehe. It is reported that the Japanese plan to organize Chinese traitors Cheng Guorui, Li Jichun, and Fang Yongchang into three army corps to act as special forces to disrupt Rehe. Recently, Japanese planes have frequently flown over Rehe for reconnaissance. Some time ago, when a certain military officer from our side was traveling from Rehe to Beiping by car, a Japanese plane chased after him for several hours before leaving. The situation in Rehe is becoming increasingly tense, and the people of the country should pay close attention. Tang has expressed his determination to resist Japan and has increased defenses in the Nanling area. Feng Zhanhai's troops have also recently been replenished and will support Rehe.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Westward Retreat of Feng Zhanhai's Troops</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's report, Feng Zhanhai's Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army has been fighting the Japanese invaders for years, traversing thousands of miles. Exhausted of ammunition and without reinforcements, he was forced to lead his troops westward. On the day of crossing the river, the soldiers, knowing that they could not take their families with them and fearing that they would be humiliated by the enemy, mostly slit the throats of their beloved wives and children before tearfully heading west. Passing through the desolate areas of western Liaoning, and at a time when nine out of ten houses were empty, they marched hurriedly, often going days without a full meal. This report is truly written with every word soaked in blood and tears, making it unbearable to finish reading. Alas, can there be anything more tragic and agonizing in this world?  Since the sudden invasion by the strong enemy in the three northeastern provinces of our country, and after the complete retreat of the army responsible for defending the country and protecting its territory, the only force supporting the precarious situation and preserving our national spirit from extinction has been our Volunteer Army, lacking both supplies and weapons. With their bare hands, they fought in the frozen wilderness, causing the enemy to be discouraged and the rebels to change their colors. People all over the world have been impressed. Their loyalty, courage, bravery, and extraordinary perseverance are truly enough to move heaven and earth and cause the gods to weep. However, after fighting bitterly for so long, even though more than a year has passed, our Volunteer Army has ultimately suffered due to the lack of sustained support and the relentless increase in enemy firepower. Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen have already suffered defeats one after another, retreating to corners. Now, even Feng Zhanhai's troops cannot avoid retreating westward due to the exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements. Alas, while one corner is fighting desperately, the entire nation sits idly by, watching as if it were a matter of no concern. Whose fault is it that the Volunteer Army has been defeated?  The closing declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee stated: "The responsibility of this Party is to seek freedom and equality for China, to consolidate the integrity of the nation's territory, sovereignty, and administration. If there is any infringement upon these, we vow to resist and restore them with all our strength, together with the people of the country." This kind of announcement is resolute and deeply admired by the people of the whole country. Since the loss of the eastern provinces of our country, more than a year has passed. We have always hoped that the government would prepare to recover the lost territory, but we also feared that this hope would not easily materialize. Now, at a time when the people's morale is about to decline, the government suddenly makes this kind of announcement, which is truly enough to invigorate our people. I believe that the most urgent task for defending against disaster today is, firstly, to provide practical assistance to the Volunteer Army fighting arduously in the Northeast, so that loyal and courageous citizens will not simply look up to the sky and shed blood, lamenting the impossibility of saving the country, and that those who rise up later will be emboldened and inspired to fight for themselves. This one thing alone is enough to uphold justice in the world.   What is even more heartrending is that the Volunteer Army has been fighting bitterly outside the customs for years, risking their lives in the frozen wilderness, while the people in the country enjoy themselves as usual. On the day Feng's troops slit the throats of their beloved wives and children and tearfully headed west, it was the very moment when the sons and daughters of wealthy families in the cities were reveling in wine and song in brightly lit places. Before the country has perished, the hearts of the people have already died. Like birds nesting on a hanging curtain, they are unaware of the danger. Comparing these two situations, we can only cry out to heaven in anguish. Fellow countrymen, if you still hope that our nation can be saved and that our Republic of China will not be trampled by the enemy's iron hooves, then from this day on, we must exert the strength of our entire nation to fully support the Volunteer Army, so that the enemy cannot sit securely in the three northeastern provinces. We must know that the military force that defends our nation today is actually the Volunteer Army, a military force of the people. Saving the Volunteer Army is saving the nation, and it is also saving ourselves. Fellow countrymen, awaken quickly!</p>

<h3>Zhu Jiahua Cables Shanghai Describing Advantages and Disadvantages of Separation of Postal Savings</h3>
<p>The Key to Consolidating Postal Services:</p>
<p>Lies in the Improvement of the Postal Industry Itself</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, Zhu Jiahua sent a letter through Wu Tiecheng to the members of the Postal Economic System Research Association, stating the advantages and disadvantages of the separation and merger of postal services and savings and remittances. The main point is that the key to consolidating the postal foundation is not in the separation and merger of postal services and savings and remittances, but in the improvement of the industry itself. What needs to be paid attention to is how to ensure the safety of savings, use them wisely, and seek the interests of depositors, and how to develop the savings and remittance business, so as to promote financial circulation and increase people's savings. The postal savings and remittance industry is also a national transportation undertaking. The profit and loss of savings and remittances are the profit and loss of transportation. For related undertakings that belong to the same entity, if disputes over separation and merger affect savings and credit, it is not the original intention of those who love postal services and savings and remittances.

<h3>Roosevelt Rejects Hoover's Offer to Jointly Resolve War Debts</h3>
<p>To Avoid Restrictions on Post-Inauguration Administration</p>
<p>Official Publication of Correspondence</p>
<p>French Press Praises Roosevelt's Understanding of Principles</p>
<p>Hoover to Abandon Proposal for Forming a Committee</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 21st – The war debt issue is now entirely left to the Democratic government to handle. Today, the American President has declared that cooperative action between him and President-elect Roosevelt has ended. Roosevelt believes it is inconvenient to agree to his proposal, and he will respect Roosevelt's wishes. A senior government official also stated that the President will no longer pursue the war debt issue during his remaining term. After making this statement, the US government immediately released the exchange of telegrams between the two Presidents. Initially, on the 17th, Hoover telegraphed Roosevelt, outlining his plan to select a bipartisan committee and asking if Roosevelt would like to join in selecting this committee, or if he preferred to postpone the entire war debt issue until after March 4th. Upon receiving the telegram, Roosevelt immediately consulted with key members of his party. It is reported that Democratic leaders believe this plan is a Republican attempt to trick the Democrats into accepting a Republican plan and a Republican committee to resolve the war debts. Therefore, on the 19th, Roosevelt replied, "I believe you will also recognize that it would be unwise for me to accept an apparent joint responsibility at a time when I have no constitutional authority to participate fully." The next day, Hoover again telegraphed Roosevelt, urging him to cooperate and requesting that he appoint Young, House, or other Democrats to consult with government officials to find a way to avoid delays. According to the Republicans, this proposal was intended to invite a Democratic representative to informally assist the cabinet in deciding on the selection of the committee and the steps to be taken. The White House anticipated that this proposal would be accepted by the Democrats, hence the optimistic tone yesterday. Unexpectedly, in the evening, they received Roosevelt's reply, stating, "If I accept joint responsibility, it will inevitably be interpreted by debtor and other nations as I have been tasked with carrying out predetermined policies and paths. I am deeply concerned that in future negotiations, or even in matters beyond debt, debtor nations may attempt to bind the new government to what is recommended or agreed upon by the current administration. However, I would be grateful to be kept informed of the current progress of the preparations for negotiations, and in the meantime, I am happy to freely contribute my opinions." After receiving the telegram, President Hoover knew that the war debt issue could not be resolved during his remaining term, and that the Republican plan to work with the Democrats to formulate negotiation strategies and resolutions would not succeed. Angered, he expressed his intention to not proceed. The resolution of the war debt issue is of great importance to large American bankers and industrialists. Therefore, the Democrats want to resolve it themselves after taking office, while the Republicans are unwilling to simply abandon it. The recent Congressional decision to require debtor nations to pay the installments due in December indicates that Hoover's moratorium plan has expired and terminated. The recent reluctance of the American President to seek to form another committee through normal diplomatic channels, the Congress's strong opposition to this move, and Roosevelt's repeated declarations that it should be handled through normal diplomatic channels are all for this reason.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 23rd – President Hoover, regarding Roosevelt's documents on war debts, believes that Roosevelt is unwilling to cooperate. Upon hearing this, Roosevelt expressed surprise and issued a statement saying that President Hoover is now making an implication that he believes that cooperative behavior on foreign issues should not be agreed to, which is regrettable. It is not only detrimental to our country but also to the resolution of world problems. In fact, he suggested to Hoover that Hoover could select his representatives to conduct preliminary research and show him the progress, and he also promised to discuss everything with President Hoover in the future and before March 4th.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 22nd – The correspondence between Hoover and Roosevelt has recently been released by the White House. British newspapers commented on Roosevelt's response, saying that they did not expect it to be so straightforward, but they still hope that Hoover's plan can succeed. However, it is not easy for European countries to only negotiate with Hoover's representatives. The documents between Hoover and Roosevelt did not have enough to make the French parliament change its attitude. The French press highly praised Roosevelt's understanding of matters and found it very fair.</p>

<h3>Former British Prime Minister Willing to Go to Jail for Leaking Cabinet Secrets and Spend Christmas There</h3>
<p>Lord Hailsham's Careless Remarks</p>
<p>Provoke Criticism from Lloyd George</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd – Lord Hailsham issued a serious warning in the House of Lords yesterday, saying that former cabinet members who leak secrets from former cabinet meetings should be sentenced to two years in prison. This statement has now provoked strong criticism from former Prime Minister Lloyd George. Hailsham issued this warning because several former cabinet members gave different accounts in the House of Commons on December 14th of the original situation of British-American handling of debts. George was one of the speakers on that day. Today, George stated in the House of Commons that it was unheard of for the House of Lords to threaten members of the House of Commons. George also mentioned correspondence between him and the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Horne, ten years ago, saying that if there were any problems with leaking any part of the confidential matters at that time, he, as the Prime Minister at the time, might as well announce the entire contents. If he and Horne were to go to jail together, they could spend a happy Christmas in jail. However, the current cabinet members would also have to go to jail along with them.</p>

Its contents show an expenditure of 107,596,000 yen and a revenue of only 88,651,000 yen, resulting in a deficit of 18,944,000 yen. Compared with this year's expenditures, the figures are:</p>
<p>1933　　　1932</p>
<p>(Unit: 1,000 yen)</p>
<p>Old City　　72,473　　60,344</p>
<p>New City　　35,122　　15,265</p>
<p>Total　　107,595　　75,609</p>
<p>The increase in expenditure amounts to 31,987,000 yen. This huge increase in the budget is for military urban planning purposes. The establishment of anti-aircraft guns and other weapons, the improvement of military roads, and the conversion of wooden school buildings to reinforced concrete structures account for an absolute amount. Because of the increased plan to militarize the city, the Municipal Finance Bureau cannot but implement tax increases. It is reported that ordinary lower-class citizens, salaried workers, and small business owners in Tokyo have all risen up in opposition. They have also stated that in the midst of the recession, they do not need war, but they want peace and reduced taxes.</p>
<h3>Japan's Constitutional Guardian, Yukio Ozaki, Flees to a Foreign Country</h3>
<p>Regarded as a Thorn in the Side by Fascist Party</p>
<p>Desperate to Eliminate Him</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 23rd – It is widely rumored among Japanese people here that Yukio Ozaki may not dare to return to the country. Since the first Diet, Ozaki has served as a Diet member, and he is known as the Guardian of the Constitution, alongside Inukai. He is famous throughout the country. Recently, he also made a statement criticizing the overstepping behavior of young military officers, causing the military cliques and Fascist party members to hate him as a thorn in their side. Every time they boast that if Ozaki returns to the country, they will surely make him follow Inukai's footsteps and be satisfied. Therefore, Ozaki may not dare to return to the country easily. At one time, there were rumors of unrest, and people were shaken. The Japanese military clique, fearing that things would become difficult and would affect the country's image, issued a statement today in the name of Ozaki's secretary, saying that Ozaki Yukio had recently sent a letter from London, originally scheduled to return from London on December 16th, but due to the illness of his wife, he had to postpone his return temporarily. The rumors that he would permanently reside in England and not return are untrue. However, the truth is that I have not dared to determine it, he said.</p>

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Confirms Confidence in Paul-Boncour Cabinet</h3>
<p>Havas, Paris, 22nd – The new Premier Paul-Boncour announced the new Cabinet's program to the Chamber of Deputies. The first part of his declaration was seen in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the final paragraph is supplemented as follows. Regarding the issue of disarmament, Paul-Boncour said that the previous government had strived to eliminate the hesitation and procrastination in the Disarmament Conference. This kind of procrastination almost caused the conference to fail. The efforts of the previous government had considerable success. For example, Germany's return to the Disarmament Conference was an important result. However, the principle of equality of armaments is recognized in the concrete construction of international, or at least European, security. The French government is strictly guarding against anyone using this recognition to engage in the restoration of armaments, which would run counter to the purpose of the Disarmament Conference. Regarding agricultural issues, Paul-Boncour said that the government will soon ask the parliament to pass laws to protect the wheat market and pass new measures so that all agricultural products can receive more complete protection. Regarding the issue of unemployment, Paul-Boncour said that the government intends to continue the unfinished work of the former Minister of Labor. For those who are able to support themselves through work but have suffered unwarranted disasters, they will be provided with assistance. This is the principle of national solidarity and survival. As for the nationalization of production enterprises, the government should strive to do so, but on the condition of respecting individual rights and not hindering the independence, justice, and wholeness of workers granted by law. Overseas French colonies will also be asked to cooperate in order to seek economic recovery. This is the immediate goal of the new cabinet. Paul-Boncour said at the end of the presentation, "Today, we ask your Chamber for your confidence."</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 22nd – After the new Premier Paul-Boncour issued the declaration, he immediately accepted the motion proposed by Deputy Yurin, that is, to raise the question of confidence. Yurin's motion is as follows: "The Chamber of Deputies has carefully listened to the Cabinet's declaration, believing that the government can follow the public will and continue to implement policies such as consolidating peace, reorganizing the economy and finances, maintaining social progress, and popularizing education." The case was immediately put to a vote. As a result of the vote, 379 people voted in favor and 166 people voted against, and it was passed.</p>
<h3>Philippine Independence Act</h3>
<p>Result of Negotiation Between the Two Houses</p>
<p>Compromised to Ten Years</p>
<p>Reduced Restrictions on Immigration and Trade</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 22nd – Today, the US Senate passed the Philippine Independence Act after negotiation between the two houses. There was little debate. It has now been transferred to the House of Representatives, but it may not be able to be placed on the agenda before the holidays. The case includes the following points: (1) Independence is granted after a ten-year transition period, without the need to decide through a citizens' assembly. (2) From the sixth year onwards, the Philippines should implement gradually increasing export tariffs, with the tariff rate in accordance with regular US tariff rules, starting from 5% and up to 25%. (3) Export tariff revenue is used to repay Philippine public debt. (4) The duty-free amount of Philippine sugar exported to the United States should be limited to 800,000 tons of raw sugar per year and 50,000 tons of refined sugar per year. (5) The duty-free amount of coconut oil exported to the United States should be limited to 200,000 tons per year, and the duty-free amount of rope exported to the United States should be limited to 3,000,000 pounds per year. (6) The annual immigration quota from the Philippines to the United States is set at 50 people, but this provision will only take effect after the Philippine Legislative Assembly or Constitutional Convention accepts the Independence Act. (7) The United States retains the right to preserve naval and military bases in the Philippines. (8) Please ask the US President to negotiate a neutrality treaty to protect Philippine independence. It is expected that the US President will veto this case, but independence advocates in both houses believe that both houses can still have sufficient votes to override the President's veto.</p>

<h3>Major Fire in Korean District of Tokyo</h3>
<p>More Than 20 Killed and 18 Injured</p>
<p>Ninety-Two Households Homeless</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd – At 1:00 AM today, a fire broke out on the second floor of the Daifuku Market, operated by a Korean group in the Fukagawa district. Thirty-two households were destroyed. The fire was extinguished by 2:30 AM. In the sixty rooms of the three-story market apartment, 54 Japanese and Korean families with 270 people had nowhere to escape, causing great chaos. More than twenty people were burned to death, eighteen were injured, and thirty-two were missing.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd – At 1:00 AM this morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the Korean residence in Fukagawa Ward, Fukukawa-cho. Twenty houses were completely or partially burned. Approximately 92 families were impacted. Because there was a market below it, it was extremely chaotic and extremely tragic. As of 11:00 AM, it was determined that 19 Koreans and 3 Japanese had died, including 15 children. The cause of the fire is currently under serious investigation by the authorities. One theory is that it was arson.</p>
<h3>A Record of Inspection in Yexian After the Calamity (Continued)</h3>
<p>Ruined Wells, Collapsed Walls, a Land of Tiles and Rubble</p>
<p>A Century of Flourishing Essence Destroyed in a Single Conflict</p>
<p>(Public and Private Losses Difficult to Estimate) Since the outbreak of this military event, the losses to the entire county have been truly impossible to calculate. Initially, the Chamber of Commerce advanced 50,000 silver dollars, and the military commissariat prepared supplies, spending approximately over 100,000 silver dollars. After Liu Zhennian ordered self-sufficiency in supplies, the people's money, food, livestock, clothing, antiques, calligraphy, and paintings—everything the populace possessed—were requisitioned by the military, leaving almost nothing. A once-flourishing city that had not suffered from war for centuries was left with only an empty shell. How can one estimate the value of such losses? The buildings outside the four gates of the city were all demolished. Many houses inside the city were also damaged. Within five *li* of the city walls, beans and crops were not harvested, and wheat was not sown. The land is now barren for dozens of *li*, and there is no hope of harvest until July of next year. Other population and livestock suffered heavy casualties. Carts, oxen, and horses were all requisitioned. What is the total amount of all public and private losses? It is truly difficult to obtain an accurate statistic.</p>
<p>(The Towering City Walls Are About to Collapse) The Yexian city walls were known for their sturdy construction and neat alignment. This military event nearly hollowed them out entirely. The damage is divided into three layers: ㈠ The surface: Liu's army dug trenches on top of the city walls, several feet deep. ㈡ The middle: Liu's army dug tunnels in the middle of the city walls and excavated gun emplacements outward to fire cannons. ㈢ The foundations: Liu's army dug tunnels at the base of the city walls, creating passages inside and outside, bypassing the city gates. The entire circumference of the city was hollowed out, with holes only a few paces apart. The city walls, damaged in these three layers, are now in imminent danger of collapse. Repairing them will not be easy, and if heavy rains come, they are bound to collapse.</p>
<p>(Ancient Mansions and Wealthy Houses Are Emptied) Yexian was known for its wealth, and many officials emerged during the late Ming dynasty, reaching the pinnacle of fame and success. Ancient mansions and wealthy houses were everywhere. Antiques, calligraphy, and paintings were passed down through generations, and collections were quite rich. Since September 21, when Liu Zhennian ordered the military to requisition supplies independently, soldiers have openly requisitioned. Even ordinary people and small households were not spared. One can imagine what happened to those with even a slightly renowned name. The Lu family in Xiguan, a family of high-ranking officials for generations, possessed great wealth. One day, they were moving valuables into the city, including 130 fine fur coats and countless antiques and jade objects, worth approximately one million [silver dollars]. Suddenly, they encountered soldiers who requisitioned everything and took it away. Another family had six gold bricks hidden away, and they suffered the same fate. Moreover, these requisition teams, upon arriving at a home, took everything, regardless of its value. Items inconvenient to carry were destroyed. The porcelain and ancient bricks collected by one family were deemed worthless by the requisition team and were wantonly smashed. Fragments of broken bricks still fill several large carts. Yexian has suffered a great calamity, and the collections of most ancient mansions and wealthy houses have been exhausted. It is feared that they will now be on par with ordinary people.</p>
<p>(Explosions of Abandoned Bombs Occur Daily) After Liu's army retreated, many landmines and bombs were left buried underground, and they often detonated suddenly. Explosions occurred multiple times each day. Therefore, pedestrians were cautious, and no one dared to travel on less frequented roads. When the military conflict first arose, the beans in the fields had not yet been harvested. After Liu's army retreated, many farmers went to the fields to gather the remaining beans, triggering buried bombs, injuring people. Such incidents were frequently heard of. Currently, the Public Security Bureau has recruited a soldier who deserted from Liu's army, who is very familiar with the buried landmines. He is now being sent to the buried locations with laborers to search and dig them up. If they encounter something dangerous that they dare not move, they set fire to it from a distance to detonate it, to prevent people and livestock from accidentally triggering them and getting injured. There are also unexploded mortar shells hidden in various places, and they are also being thoroughly searched for.</p>
<p>(The Ninth Middle School Is Riddled with Underground Tunnels) The Ninth Middle School on Chayuan Street has spacious grounds and a large scale. Liu's army headquarters, and Liu Zhennian himself, were stationed there. More than fifty underground tunnels of various sizes were constructed. Liu himself lived in an underground tunnel in the main auditorium, dug more than ten feet into the ground. It was covered with loose soil, also about ten feet high. The soil was covered with steel plates, making it extremely sturdy. The interior was lined with mats, and the furniture and equipment were complete. Liu lived there, rarely venturing out. Other radio and command centers were also set up in the school. The school authorities are now gradually filling in the underground tunnels, actively preparing for the resumption of classes. However, most of the school equipment has been damaged, and supplementing it will be a significant undertaking.</p>
<p>(Careless Handling of Military Supplies Leads to Civilian Disasters) When Liu's army was about to retreat, landmines and bombs collected from various locations were stored in the Black Tiger Temple inside the West Gate. Unexpectedly, due to a moment of carelessness, a thunderous explosion occurred, destroying the entire temple. Hundreds of civilian homes in the surrounding area were also affected. Half of the nearby city wall collapsed. Two giant bells inside the temple were shattered into dozens of pieces. More than ten engineers were all killed in the explosion, leaving only severed limbs and remains. It was a tragic event.</p>
<p>(Eight Thousand Starving Refugees Await Relief) After Liu's army completely withdrew, people who had fled to various places gradually returned to Yexian. Upon seeing their former homes, even those that had not been reduced to rubble were left with bare walls and nothing inside. Even formerly wealthy households had nothing to live on upon their return. Widespread misery prevailed, and people cried out for food. According to a survey by the Red Swastika Society, there are more than 2,000 refugee households, totaling more than 8,000 people, urgently awaiting relief. Fortunately, the Red Swastika Societies in Qingdao, Jinan, Yantai, Longkou, and other places have come to Yexian to provide emergency relief, establishing five porridge kitchens, distributing porridge twice a day, and distributing more than 2,000 sets of cotton clothing. They are also raising 12,000 silver dollars, intending to provide relief based on the severity of the disaster, from two to twenty dollars per household. Three thousand dollars have already been distributed on the 18th. It is reported that the Qingdao Chamber of Commerce has also donated more than 500 sets of cotton clothing and is raising funds to come to Yexian for relief in the coming days.</p>
<p>(Organizing a Relief Committee to Handle Post-Disaster Affairs) County Magistrate Zhao Hongze, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Weixiang, and others, recognizing the severity of the disaster and the fact that the people have no clothing or food, and that, although the Red Swastika Society and others have established porridge kitchens in Yexian, the Society's financial constraints make it difficult to sustain operations for long, and that the closure of the porridge kitchens would leave 8,000 refugees facing starvation, have jointly organized a relief committee with various government agencies and local figures to raise funds for relief. Zhao was publicly elected as the chairman, and the heads of various bureaus and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce were elected as members. A general meeting has been held to establish six groups: investigation, distribution, fundraising, documentation, accounting, and general affairs, to actively carry out post-disaster management.

<h3>The Guangdong Army Captures Zixi and Lichuan in Eastern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The Puppet Military Conference Decides on a New Plan</p>
<p>Zhu De and Mao Zedong Flee Southeast from the Jiangxi-Fujian Border</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang: After the collapse of the four bandit groups of Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ronghuan at Xuwan, they retreated towards the Fujian border. The puppet First and Second Army Corps retreated from Xiaoshi in Nancheng to Lichuan. The puppet Fifth Army Corps retreated to Kangdu, at the junction of Nanfeng, Lichuan, and Jianning. The puppet Fourth Army was stationed in Zixi. The puppet Twenty-second Army, led by Luo Binghui, scurried around the border areas of Zixi, Guixi, and Guangze, attempting to unite with the two bandit groups led by Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping on the Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Fujian border. However, the bandit leaders Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and Peng Dehuai, suffering significant losses in this northward invasion, convened a puppet military conference in Lichuan to salvage the remnants and reorganize. They consolidated all the remaining forces into three army corps and five military regions: (A) The puppet army corps commanders were: 1. Lin Biao, 2. Peng Dehuai, 3. Luo Binghui, and, according to one account, Dong Zhentang. (B) Ruijin and Ningdu were designated as the puppet central region, garrisoned by the puppet guard and student army. Xunwu, Anyuan, and Huichang were designated as the Jiangxi-Guangdong border region, commanded by the puppet Twentieth Army Commander Chen Yi. Chongyi, Shangyou, and Yongxin, up to Ninggang, were designated as the Jiangxi-Hunan region, commanded by the puppet Eighth Army Commander Li Tianzhu. The puppet Sixteenth Army Commander Kong Hechong was appointed as the puppet commander of the Jiangxi-Hubei-Hunan military region. The puppet Seventh and Ninth Divisions fled to eastern Hubei. The puppet Independent Division and Red Second Division hid in the mountains around Xiushui, Tongcheng, Liuyang, Wan'an, and Chongyang. The puppet Tenth Army Commander Fang Zhimin was the commander of the Jiangxi-Northeast military region. The original 82nd, 83rd, and 84th Regiments and the Red Guard Division scattered around Zhoufang, Fangdun, and Hengfeng. The puppet Twenty-second Army Commander Luo Binghui also served as the commander of the Northwest Fujian military region, with the puppet Independent 36th, 32nd, and 34th Divisions, formed by local bandits, garrisoning the border areas of Changting, Jianning, Ninghua, Guangze, and Shaowu bordering Jiangxi, and maintaining contact with the puppet Fifth Army Corps, holding on to their old nests. This is the bandits' new plan and the approximate outline of their new distribution. Earlier, the main forces of Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Lin Biao suffered almost complete losses in the battles of Yihuang, Jinxi, and Linchuan. Therefore, in Lichuan, Zixi, Guangze, and other areas, the puppet village soviets were forced to capture every able-bodied man to serve in the Red Army. The residents fled en masse. As for kidnapping for ransom, robbing livestock and property, these were considered secondary. On the Nationalist side, Chen Cheng, the commander of the front line on the Fu River, declared the first phase of the military campaign in eastern Jiangxi complete with the capture of Jinxi. He then came to the provincial capital with Sun Lianzhong to request instructions for the second phase of the campaign from the headquarters of the three provinces. The chief of staff, He Guoguang, discussed the plan to advance towards the Fujian border with Chen and Sun. After Chen returned to Fuzhou, he commanded the Fourth, Eighteenth, Twenty-seventh, and Thirty-seventh Armies of eastern Jiangxi to attack Zhu De and Mao Zedong in Lichuan and Zixi. A telegram from Nancheng reports that in this attack on Lichuan, the division of Zhou Zhirou served on the right wing, the division of Wu Qiwu in the center, and the division of Li Yunjie on the left wing, taking a three-sided encirclement of Lichuan from the area of Xiaoshi. After the general attack on the 19th, the bandits dared not engage and retreated towards Guangze, Shaowu, Jianning, and Guangchang. The Nationalist army completely recovered Zixi that afternoon, capturing many prisoners and pursuing the fleeing bandits southeastward. Furthermore, a dispatch from Jinxi reports that the Fifth Division, after the capture of Jinxi, largely returned to Guixi, with a portion remaining in the county town for post-war management. Its Independent Third Regiment was ordered to depart for Zixi, advancing along the way, encountering only minor resistance from scattered bandits. The regiment recovered Zixi County on the 15th and is currently managing the aftermath. Now that Zixi and Lichuan have been captured, only Guangchang Peak in eastern Jiangxi remains in the hands of the bandits. The Zhejiang-Fujian border area is now less empty than before, as Liu Zhennian's troops arrived in Pucheng and Chongan early, so the division of Zhao Guantao on the Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Fujian border is advancing towards Yihuang, attacking Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping. Commander Zhao has left Shangrao for the front line to supervise the troops. It is believed that Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping have lost contact with Zhu De and Mao Zedong, making it easy to defeat them in one fell swoop. (December 21)</p>
<h3>The Founding of the Tianjin Volunteer Army Support Association</h3>
<p>Wang Renwen and Others Elected as Directors</p>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin: The Northeast Volunteer Army has risen up one after another, fighting fiercely against the enemy's cannons and firearms, exhausting the Japanese army. This heroic spirit, fighting for national dignity, is both laudable and moving. However, whether the Volunteer Army can sustain its operations depends entirely on the availability of supplies. People from all walks of life in Tianjin, aware of this, have organized the Tianjin Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. The inaugural meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the 18th of this month at the Li Family Garden on No. 14 Road in the British Concession. The proceedings of the meeting were as follows: ㈠ Zhou Yufu was publicly elected as the temporary chairman and reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that since the fall of the Northeast, the Volunteer Army has been facing extreme difficulties in military supplies since the beginning of the resistance against Japan. People across the country have recognized this, and Northeast Volunteer Army Support Associations have been organized in Shanghai, Guangdong, and other places. However, it is also necessary for Tianjin, which is close to the Northeast and is an important town in North China, to organize. Therefore, we have established this association out of conscience and patriotism to continuously supply the Volunteer Army, so that it can resist for a long time, to recover the lost territory. ㈡ The declaration, organizational guidelines, regulations for the supervisory committee, custodian committee, and other matters were approved. ㈢ Thirty-three people, including Wang Renwen, Tang Xiangming, Yang Shounan, Bo Yizhong, Zhou Yufu, Wang Jiexia, Luo Longji, Tan Tinghui, Bian Baimei, Liu Bozhao, Qiu Changwei, Wang Qingguang, Wang Yanchu, Gui Binyu, Wang Yanling, and Yu Weihua, were elected as directors. Nine people, including Liu Siying, Ma Derun, Hu Zushun, Lao Yuchun, and Zhu Yisheng, were elected as supervisory committee members. Nine people, including Li Hongfu, Deng Futing, Zhang Chenghua, and Zhu Qinxuan, were elected as custodian committee members. ㈣ All ongoing matters were discussed. ㈤ Liu Dalun, Wang Jiguang, Wang Yanling, Li Diguang, and others gave speeches. The atmosphere at the meeting was very enthusiastic and tense. ㈥ After the meeting, the elected directors held a board meeting and immediately elected eleven standing directors, including Wang Renwen, Tang Xiangming, Yang Shounan, Zhou Yufu, Wang Jiexia, Luo Longji, Bian Baimei, Wang Qingguang, Wang Yanchu, Gui Binyu, and Wang Yanling. Gui Binyu was appointed as the director of the general affairs group, Wang Yanchu as the director of the public relations group, Wang Qingguang as the director of the investigation group, and Wang Yanling as the director of the propaganda group. At the same time, the board of directors also hired thirty-three people, including Zhang Fengge, Lin Kecheng, Lai Guogao, Zhu Longzhang, Yu Weihua, Chen Jingguo, Niu Xianjuan, Chen Jun, Niu Xianzheng, and Xu Tiancong, as fundraising committee members. It is also reported that the four groups have held joint meetings, making detailed plans and actively carrying out their respective tasks.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Actively Implements Winter Defense</h3>
<p>The North River Training Division Recalled to the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>Municipal Land and Water Police Intensify Security</p>
<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou: Recently, as the end of the old and new lunar years approaches, stores are busy with year-end accounts and frequent transactions of funds. As a matter of routine, the authorities conduct winter defense during this period. It is reported that the military authorities, to protect the provincial capital, have ordered the entire Training Division currently stationed in the North River to return to defend Guangzhou, stationing them at key locations in the suburbs to prevent theft by petty criminals. Within the city of Guangzhou, the Provincial Public Security Bureau began implementing winter defense on the 20th of this month. All armed security teams of the Public Security Bureau have temporarily suspended training and have been organized into armed patrol teams, patrolling the main thoroughfares near their original locations. The detective section of the Public Security Bureau has also been ordered to dispatch plainclothes detectives to various public security sub-bureaus starting on the 20th, to assist the sub-bureaus in winter defense. All off-duty police officers from the sub-bureaus will form patrol teams each day, patrolling the city day and night. During the day, detectives will go to various docks, stations, and entertainment venues to investigate criminals. At night, sub-bureau officers will lead armed police to search restaurants, hotels, inns, theaters, opium dens, and gambling houses, paying attention to the presence of petty criminals. During the period of heightened security, special attention will be paid to any changes in household registrations. Officers are not allowed to leave their posts without special cause. On the Pearl River, the Water Police Sub-Bureau will deploy additional armed water police to assist patrol ships in closely inspecting passing vessels in the main waterways. All rural ferries and foreign steamers docking must undergo inspection of disembarking passengers. As for the brothel boats and pleasure boats, which are usually mixed with the good and bad, they are confined to a fixed location and are not allowed to approach other vessels. Small boats that take in lodgers are prohibited from accommodating guests at night. (December 16)</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Library's Rich Collection</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan: Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, has spared no effort in collecting antiquities in recent years. The library already has a Han Dynasty Relief Hall and a Luo Quan Building. Now, there are plans to build a Shang Pottery Room to specially house the Qin and Han bricks and tiles of Gao Hansheng of Weixian, as well as the finest examples of Six Dynasties Buddhist statues. More than thirty stone statues have already been collected, and the gilded relief stone statues are rare treasures. Recently, another ten statues have been purchased. One is a Qingtai Second Year (Tang Dynasty) tomb epitaph made of brick by Yan Sheng. The other nine stones are all Qi Dynasty statues unearthed at the border between Guangrao and Linzi. Because there was a Thousand Buddha Temple in that area during the Six Dynasties, which was destroyed long ago, there were many statues in the temple. Several stones had already been discovered and taken away. These statues have all been transported to the library. They include: ㈠ Qingtai Second Year (Tang Dynasty) brick tomb epitaph of Yan Sheng (unearthed in Qingzhou) ㈡ Le'an Zhu Hai statue from the Tenth Year of Tianbao (Qi Dynasty) ㈢ Sun Moning statue (Qi Dynasty) ㈣ Statue from Binshan et al. from the Tiantong period (Qi Dynasty) ㈤ Li Pan brothers statue from the Second Year of Wuping (Qi Dynasty) ㈥ Shi Yingshi statue from the Fourth Year of Heqing (Qi Dynasty) ㈦ Fan Zhen statue from Yangxin from the Fourth Year of Tianbao (Qi Dynasty) ㈧ Shao Chouzhu statue from the Tenth Year of Tianbao (Qi Dynasty) ㈨ Zhang Zhan statue from Le'an from the Heqing period (Qi Dynasty) ㈩ Zhang Zuohu statue from Le'an from the Fifth Year of Tiantong (Qi Dynasty) (The above are all relics of the Thousand Buddha Temple.)</p>
<h3>Bombing Incident Occurs in Wuhu</h3>
<p>The Bombed Were One Silk Store and Two Cloth Stores</p>
<p>The Bomb Throwing Youths Identified Themselves as an Anti-Traitor Group</p>
<p>A dispatch from Wuhu: At about 5:00 PM today, the Xi Jinglun Silk Store in Changjie Doumen Lane and the Hengfengxiang and Heji cloth stores (located in the same place) near the Sansheng Archway in this port were simultaneously bombed by people identifying themselves as the "Save-the-Nation Dare-to-Die Comrades Association Anti-Traitor Group Dare-to-Die Team on the Anti-Japanese Front Anti-Traitor Group". Three youths went to the stores together, mostly dressed in Western style. They entered the stores under the pretense of visiting, then threw bombs and left immediately. Although the bomb at Xi Jinglun did not explode, all the store staff were panicked. They immediately reported to the police station, who took away the abandoned bomb. The bomb at Heji landed next to the Hengfengxiang counter, outside the goods cabinet. It exploded with a loud bang, filling the air with smoke. The daughter (16 years old) of the manager of that store, Bei Zuoqing, was coming out from inside, and the pupil of her left eye was shattered by the explosion. She was immediately sent to Zhong Shouzhi Hospital for treatment. The floor was blown into a large hole, and the glass cabinets and goods were also damaged. The neighboring stores, startled by this incident, closed their doors one after another, closing shop early. Afterwards, the military and police authorities were notified and dispatched teams to the scene, but it was impossible to catch the perpetrators. Soon after, the cloth stores all received a warning letter from the anti-traitor group, stating that they must seal up all enemy goods within a certain number of days and declare this in the newspapers, or else they would be bombed without mercy. It is reported that Xi Jinglun Silk Store had previously had a dispute with the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for selling Japanese goods. (December 21)</p>
<h3>Reasons for Jiangsu Provincial Government's Announcement of Abolishing the Industry Department</h3>
<p>After the Jiangsu Provincial Government abolished the Department of Industry, some local people opposed it. Yesterday, the Provincial Government specially issued an order to the county governments, explaining in detail the reasons for abolishing the Department of Industry, in the hope that the local people could understand. The following is an excerpt from the order: "Upon investigation, most provinces have not established an Industry Department. Even Zhejiang Province and Jiangsu Province, which are among the best defended, as well as provinces wealthier than Jiangxi and Zhejiang, still lack such departments. Although Hubei once established a Department of Agriculture and Mines, it was subsequently abolished. This shows that the financial capacity of the Chinese government, the level of development of agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining, and the state of the national economy have not yet reached the stage where a dedicated department can be established. Since the reorganization of the Agriculture and Mines Department into the Industry Department in Jiangsu Province, the various agricultural, industrial, commercial, and mining sectors have not seen significant results, while the annual expenditure of the department and its affiliated agencies has exceeded one million. At a time when the treasury is empty and all important government affairs are feeling the pinch, spending huge sums of money annually, mostly on industrial administration and promotional expenses, is not practically effective. Judging from the principles of economics, this is unwise. If we look at the provinces in the country that have not established an Industry Department, their industrial development is no less advanced than that of Jiangsu. Moreover, since Jiangsu Province had the Department of Agriculture and Mines and later changed to the Industry Department, has its industrial performance in the past few years been superior to that of other provinces? In general, there are priorities and urgencies, and in an era of financial hardship, one should naturally prioritize what is important and urgent, so as not to hinder each other and lead to stagnation. There are countless important government affairs to be handled in this province, and for the past year, many have been difficult to promote due to limited funding. This government, learning from the past, cannot but shift from gradual to urgent measures to seek a fundamental solution. After repeated discussions and careful consideration by this government's committee, it was unanimously agreed that there is no need to establish a Department of Industry given the current financial situation and the level of industrial and commercial development in this province. Moreover, according to Articles 8, Section 2 and Section 3 of the revised provincial government organization law, the committee of this government decided to temporarily abolish the Department of Industry and merge the relevant departments under its jurisdiction into the Department of Construction for concurrent management, in order to reduce expenditures. This is permissible under the law and in accordance with the facts. In the future, when the financial resources and material strength of this province and the development of industry have reached a considerable level, and there is a need to establish a dedicated management agency, it will be easy to establish. Furthermore, although the department is temporarily abolished, efforts will still be made to improve industrial undertakings and prevent them from being suspended. It is only out of a sense of the current provincial treasury's extreme shortage, the depletion of material resources, and the people's suffering under the heavy burden that the expenditures of the institutions are seen as worthless. Therefore, we must seek the most economical methods for effective improvement, considering all aspects with painstaking effort. In fact, the current industrial administration spends such huge sums of money annually, focusing on formalities and ostentation. What the people need is not an empty organizational name, but practical undertakings. This abolition of the department will not only not hinder industrial undertakings but will also fundamentally reorganize and further develop them. Therefore, this government has decided that all affiliated institutions of the department should be temporarily closed by the end of the year, and other methods of unified reorganization will be ordered separately. The original venues, funds, and public property should be taken over and managed separately by the department and the counties, without any loss, and reports should be made. The reason is that the previous state of industrial administration had too many institutions, and the expenditures were too vast, with too much being spent on administrative expenses each year and too little being used for undertakings. At the same time, there was a lack of coordination with vocational education and agricultural education, so that specialized talents could not be increased and scientific knowledge could not be advanced. Future planning must correct the previous drawbacks. Regarding expenses, we must strive to reduce them, save all administrative expenses, and transfer them to the needs of undertakings. Regarding education, we must pay attention to vocational and rural education, encouraging learning and nurturing talent, so as to connect them. Regarding undertakings, we must concentrate the province's manpower and talent to study one by one all matters related to agriculture, sericulture, cotton spinning, animal husbandry, forestry, as well as industry, commerce, and mining, in order to achieve practical results and improve them. At the same time, regarding seeds, fertilizers, pest control, disaster preparedness, and other issues related to industry, we will select those that have been proven effective in the country and order the counties to supervise the people to implement and promote them, so as to induce improvement. In short, we will seek full development with limited resources. Although the agency is abolished, the undertakings still exist. Although expenses are saved, efforts are still made to expand them in practice. We will use the most economical and effective methods to solve the practical industrial problems needed by the society and the people, and we will never allow the government's limited money to be wasted on useless things, nor will we allow the undertakings needed by the people to be stagnated. This is the determination of this government to abolish the Department of Industry, and it is the true meaning of what is called separate unified planning. Abolishing the agency is a comprehensive plan in terms of finance, and improving industry is a necessary measure in terms of politics. The two do not hinder each other and can be carried out in parallel without contradiction. If one believes that abolishing the agency means stopping the undertakings, and if malicious people make far-fetched interpretations, it may be for ulterior motives. Those with knowledge of the matter, weighing the pros and cons in light of the facts, will understand without needing to argue. In addition to ordering the Department of Construction to carefully plan and improve the measures and to submit reports separately, we hereby order the county to immediately inform, and must follow the above instructions and earnestly implement them, and not make any misinterpretations, so as to avoid causing mistakes."</p>

<h3>Silk Sales Prosperous</h3>
<p>Since the autumn silkworm season began this year, the silk market has once again trended downwards, with prices dropping to 500 taels upon entering the customs. This is primarily due to the sharp decline in overseas Japanese silk prices, leaving Chinese silk with virtually no buyers. Domestic silk factories, seeing the silk market continuously declining, have also largely adopted a wait-and-see approach, refraining from purchasing. In recent days, American and French firms, due to short-selling futures, have been actively covering their positions, causing a sudden turnaround in the silk market and a surge in prices. Currently, Zhuang's 83-point Ivenna silk can be sold for 620 taels, and 80-point silk can be sold for 570-580 taels. French firms, such as the Double Eagle brand from the Zhenyi Silk Factory in this county, can sell for 650 taels. New-style, machine-made, re-reeled 13-15 thread silk can be sold for 690 taels. Domestic general silk factories are also actively purchasing. Currently, ordinary household silk is priced at 540-550 taels, while higher-quality goods require 580-590 taels. The price of dried cocoons has now risen to over 180 yuan. Based on a silk extraction ratio of 470-480 jin, the cost of cocoons per dan of silk is over 600 taels. Recently, the sales of silk from various factories in this county have been exceptionally brisk.</p>
<h3>Major Fire Kills Two Boys</h3>
<p>The home of Lü Mei, located in Houcun, Xixixiang Village, near Meicun in the Tenth District, caught fire the night before due to a cooking fire that ignited a pile of firewood. In an instant, the fierce flames rose and were unstoppable, spreading to neighboring houses. Lü's wife, awakened from a dream, immediately grabbed her two-year-old granddaughter and escaped naked. She attempted to rush back in to rescue her two sons, but the house had already collapsed, and the flames engulfed her, causing burns all over her body. The outer layers of her head and face peeled off, and fresh blood flowed. Her two sons, aged nine and four, were buried in the inferno. By the time the fire brigade arrived, over forty houses in the entire alley had been reduced to ashes, resulting in significant losses. Furthermore, the firewood shed belonging to residents Zhu Meisheng and Zhu Shouchang in Daxu Alley, Fourth District, also caught fire the night before, spreading to the homes of Zou Ju, Zhu Xiangsheng, and Zhu Huanqing. Over twenty houses were burned down, along with four pigs and sheep. Also, the firewood shed of Guo Guansheng's family on Baxi Bridge West Street was also carelessly ignited yesterday afternoon. Fortunately, it was daytime, and fire brigades from various locations rushed to the scene to extinguish the flames, which were quickly put out. As a result, two houses were burned down.</p>

This is a re-notification, and the company should know that righteous people do not act in secret. They should deliver the money to the agreed location as soon as possible, or they will be bombed. The company received this letter for the fourth time, presented the original letter to the Public Security Bureau yesterday, and decided to ignore it. Business is still conducted as usual today.

<h3>Cake Shop Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>The strike by various dim sum shops in Huaiyin over business taxes has lasted for four days. On the 17th, the workers paraded in formation, with workers from Yangzhuang and Matou participating, making the situation serious. County Magistrate He, believing that during this time of heightened winter defense, unscrupulous individuals might take advantage of the situation, and fearing unexpected events that could affect public order, immediately sent a letter to Colonel Liu Zhongqi of the 340th Regiment of the garrison army, requesting him to order his subordinates to assist the county police in maintaining order. After receiving the letter, Liu announced a curfew at 11 PM that night, prohibiting large groups of idlers from parading in the streets. At the same time, County Magistrate He also ordered Peng Tingjie, the captain of the political police, to summon representatives of the cake shops to the county. Under the persuasion of Liu Qixin, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, they were instructed to resume business as soon as possible. After discussions until about 1 AM, the representatives finally agreed to pay 40 yuan in taxes for the autumn and winter seasons of this year, and 40 yuan per quarter in the 22nd year, totaling 160 yuan for the whole year. They agreed to resume business uniformly on the morning of the 18th, and the workers from Yangzhuang and Matou also completely left the city. The strike thus came to an end.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu and Others Return to Shanghai Yesterday After the Close of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Sun and Wu Both Say the Impression of the Plenary Session Was Very Good</p>
<p>Sun's Inauguration Date as President of the Legislative Yuan is Undetermined</p>
<p>Wu Expresses His Unwillingness to Serve as Ambassador to the United States</p>
<p>And Talks About the Chinese People Should Wash Away Their Dependence Mentality</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session has closed, and the attending Central Committee members are leaving Beijing one after another. Those who returned to Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing at 8 AM yesterday included: Central Committee members Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Zhang Huichang, Chen Ce, Chen Qingyun, Liang Hancao, Cui Guangxiu, Li Renren, Guan Suren, Zhang Dingfan, Deng Qingyang, Pan Yunchao, Li Qi'an, Xiao Jishan, Yang Hu, Qian Dajun, etc. This reporter interviewed Sun and Wu yesterday morning. They spoke about the impression of the plenary session, as well as various domestic and foreign policy issues. Sun said he agreed to become President of the Legislative Yuan. Wu said he had firmly declined the position of Minister of Judicial Administration and was also unwilling to serve as Ambassador to the United States. As for the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee and other positions, he would consider them further. The following is a detailed account:</p>
<p>(Sun Talks About the Impression of the Plenary Session) After getting off the train, Mr. Sun went directly to his private residence on Columbia Road. This reporter went to visit him around 10 AM yesterday morning and was granted an audience. Mr. Sun first said that his personal impression of this Third Plenary Session was very good. All parties were able to implement a spirit of sincere unity and cooperation. Therefore, the result of the Third Plenary Session is that the first point is that it can represent the consistency of opinions within the Kuomintang, focusing on saving the country from foreign invasion. The second point is that all resolutions can represent the overall opinion of the party and the ardent demands of the entire nation. It is hoped that in the future, the power of cooperation between the government and the people can promote their realization one by one. The reporter then asked about the situation in Guangdong and whether there were any special opinions. It was said that Guangdong also expressed great appreciation for the resolutions of the Plenary Session.</p>
<p>(Hope for Chiang's Military Commission Leadership) The reporter asked about the feelings of Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission. He replied that Mr. Chiang's attitude was extremely sincere this time, especially on the issue of constitutional preparation, hoping to promote its early realization as much as possible. At that time, there was quite a bit of criticism, but Chiang explained in detail before it ended.</p>
<p>(Preliminary Rules for Trying Constitutional Government) Mr. Sun also said that the National Political Council, which the Plenary Session decided to convene next year, is a central public opinion organ and a preliminary rule for trying constitutional government during the period of political tutelage. However, the highest administrative power still lies with the Central Executive Committee. It will not be until the National Assembly is convened in March of the 24th year that the constitution will be formally formulated, the civil rights government will be organized, and genuine democracy will be implemented.</p>
<p>(China and Russia Negotiate Treaties) China and Russia have now formally announced the resumption of diplomatic relations. As for the Sino-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty and the Treaty of Commerce, etc., they must be negotiated after the mutual dispatch of ambassadors. Mr. Yan Huiqing's appointment as envoy to Russia has been agreed to by the other party. After being approved by the Central Political Council, it can be formally announced. As for the Soviet Ambassador to China, it is said that he will be transferred from the former ambassador to Persia.</p>
<p>(National Defense Determined Plan) Regarding the issue of national defense, there was also a very detailed discussion in the plenary session. The Military Commission also had a detailed plan report. Definite measures have been discussed for the expansion of aviation. However, since it concerns military affairs, it is not convenient to publish it. As for the issue of naval construction, due to the excessive amount of money needed and the training of talents, it cannot be effective in a short period of time. Therefore, it can only be gradually supplemented based on the needs of coastal defense.</p>
<p>(Chiang Will Go to Jiangxi to Suppress Bandits) Regarding the issue of bandit suppression, the remnants of the bandits in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, led by Xu Xiangqian and He Long, have infiltrated Shaanxi, and they will be wiped out soon. However, the Red bandits in Jiangxi are rampant. It is said that Mr. Chiang will personally go to supervise the suppression. After the military command is unified, it will be easier to eliminate them.</p>
<p>(Change of Provincial Government System) The Plenary Session decided to abolish the provincial government committee system and change it to a provincial governor system. The implementation of the provincial governor system can concentrate the powers of the provincial governor, and the responsibility is specialized, making it easier to handle affairs. On the other hand, a provincial council is established as a local public opinion organ to participate in the reform of provincial administration and to supervise the provincial governor to avoid slipping into personal dictatorship. The provincial council is also a transitional public opinion organ during the period of political tutelage, and the public opinion organ during the constitutional period is the provincial people's congress. The plenary session only decided on the principle of changing the provincial system. The detailed regulations will be discussed and decided by the Central Political Council.</p>
<p>(Decision to Become President of the Legislative Yuan) I have decided to become the President of the Legislative Yuan. The date of taking office in Beijing has not yet been determined. There have been no major changes in the heads of the various courts. The reporter asked whether Mr. Wang has recently returned to China. It was said that Mr. Wang has not yet recovered his health and needs to continue to recuperate. There is no news of his return to China for the time being.</p>
<p>(Wu Chaoshu Expresses His Opinion) This reporter visited Mr. Wu Chaoshu at his residence at 9 AM yesterday morning. The main points of Wu's speech are summarized as follows: (1) The results of this Third Plenary Session are extremely satisfactory. Various resolutions are the most important plans for our country at present. (2) There have been various speculations from the outside world about my future position. All parties hope that I will serve as the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or Ambassador to the United States, or Minister of Judicial Administration. I have firmly declined the position of Minister of Judicial Administration, and I am also unwilling to serve as Ambassador to the United States. I am still considering which position to take. (3) The resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia is the path that our country's diplomacy should follow. However, if the Chinese people rely on the League of Nations, the United States, or Soviet Russia, the result will still be failure. The victory of diplomacy lies entirely in self-reliance. I hope that the Chinese people will wash away their dependence mentality, unite as one, and work hard to save themselves.</p>
<h3>General Li Du Telegraphs Requesting Urgent Handling of Jilin Military Postal Service</h3>
<p>Dispatch Young Cadres to Organize</p>
<p>And Restore Post Offices in Various Recovered Areas</p>
<p>The United Shanghai Communications Office of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies received a telegram from General Li Du, saying: Most Urgent, Director Huang of the Shanghai Postal Service Headquarters: Jimi, I have learned that the remaining post offices within our army's defense zone under your bureau have been in a passive state since the withdrawal of your Administration from Harbin. This not only affects transportation, but also is detrimental to military affairs. In order to facilitate military secrets, this Commander-in-Chief urgently wants to organize a military postal service, but there is a lack of experienced postal personnel. Therefore, I am telegraphing to request your Director to urgently dispatch two or three young cadres to take charge of organizing the military postal service, and to restore the national post offices in Yilan and other places recently recovered by our army. At the same time, it can also promote the active contact of various post offices so that mail can be transmitted quickly at home and abroad. I believe that your headquarters has withdrawn a large number of staff from the Northeast, and there will be no difficulty in selecting personnel. As far as this Commander-in-Chief knows, Mr. Jin Shiqi, a former staff member of the Harbin Postal Administration, is extremely capable and promising. When our army entered Harbin, he provided a great deal of assistance. If he can come in this selection of personnel, it is especially welcome. In addition to organizing the military postal service, this Commander-in-Chief will do his best to maintain the promotion of postal affairs in various places. Please implement it quickly, and I sincerely hope so. All matters shall be handled by the representatives of our army, Wang Ziyao and Liu Piguang, to contact your headquarters. Li Du, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Border Defense Army, Koutou.</p>
<h3>Zhenru District Cotton Crop Failure, City Government Approves Reduction of Summer Tax</h3>
<p>Municipal Committee member of Zhenru District, Hong Lanxiang, etc., reported to the Municipal Government that the autumn cotton harvest in the district was poor and requested a reduction in taxes, etc. The Municipal Government ordered the Land, Finance, and Social Bureaus to conduct a joint survey and reply. The bureaus reported, in brief, that although the cotton crops in the district had adequate branches and leaves, the flowers and bolls were sparse and the cotton fluff was not fully developed. This was due to the severe drought during the hot season and the scarcity of rainfall. After the beginning of autumn, hurricanes and rainstorms followed one another, causing the cotton bolls to fall off. The loss was estimated to be over 50% on average. Other crops, such as soybeans and vegetables, were slightly more resistant to wind and rain than cotton, and the harvest was still good, with a maximum loss of only 10%. It was further calculated that the allocation of crop cultivation in the district this year was 50% for cotton, 30% for soybeans, 15% for vegetables, and 0.5% for others. Now, by comprehensively calculating the allocation of cultivated area and the degree of damage to various crops in the district, the total percentage of loss is 30%, which is in line with Article 6 of the city's disaster reporting and compensation measures. After consultation, the bureaus decided to include it in Grade C and proposed a general reduction of 0.05 of the summer tax to provide relief. In addition, the summer tax serial registration book for this year has already been issued by the Land Bureau and cannot be exempted. According to the provisions in the second paragraph of Article 6 of the city's disaster reporting and compensation measures, it is proposed to use it to offset the summer tax in the 22nd year, etc. After receiving the report, the Municipal Government instructed the Land and other three bureaus: "The report has been reviewed. Since the joint survey confirms that the disaster is true, permission should be granted to reduce the tax payment to show sympathy. The Land Bureau should quickly prepare a clear list of the disaster-stricken fields and the amount of tax reduction, and the Finance Bureau should verify it and add a seal before submitting it for review and transfer. This is an order."</p>
<h3>Rice and Wheat Temporarily Allowed to Be Exported from the Province</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a notice yesterday: "Ordered by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it has been found that the provincial government committee has discussed matters at its 551st meeting. The first item, proposed by the chairman, is that the province's rice and grain production in moderate years is only sufficient for self-sufficiency. Therefore, it has been prohibited from leaving the country for many years to maintain the people's food supply. This year's autumn harvest across the country has been bountiful, and the price of grain has fallen sharply. Farmers rely on the autumn harvest for their livelihood. Now that the price of grain has plummeted, the economy of farmers in this province has been greatly affected. If remedial measures are not taken quickly, the countryside will face the danger of bankruptcy. In addition to ordering the counties to earnestly handle grain storage and to conduct assessments within the prescribed time limit in accordance with previous orders, in order to increase demand, it is now proposed to temporarily allow the province's food to be exported from the province in order to raise the price of grain and alleviate the people's difficulties. Whether or not it should still be publicly decided has been discussed and resolved. For the purpose of adjusting social finance and rural economic activity, the province's rice and wheat are allowed to be sold outside the province, but a passport must be submitted to the county government for verification. Passports are not charged. If anyone transports it out of the province privately without a passport, it will still be investigated, prohibited, and punished in accordance with the regulations. In addition to notification, an order is hereby issued to the county for compliance and a public notice shall be issued to inform the public. This order is hereby issued.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government Received the National Reconstruction Bond Funds, Actually Received 4.8 Million Yuan at an 80% Discount</h3>
<p>The six million yuan of war zone reconstruction bonds in this city were underwritten by Lían Foreign Firm. In addition to the four million yuan underwritten by various banks as a whole, the remaining two million yuan was issued publicly at HSBC Bank on the 21st of this month. Within two hours in the morning, all of them were sold out. The next day (22nd), Lían Foreign Firm delivered 4.8 million yuan in cash at an 80% discount to the Municipal Government in accordance with the contract. The Municipal Government also replied with a letter. The original letter said: "In reply, I have received your letter and attached a check, all of which have been received. All of your firm's payment of 4.8 million yuan for the bonds of the disaster area reconstruction bonds in this city, in accordance with the loan contract of October 25th of this year, has been received in full. A corresponding reply is hereby given.</p>
<h3>Strange! There is a so-called "Sino-Japanese Great Alliance"</h3>
<p>Send Letters to Intimidate Patriotic Groups</p>
<p>Mr. Chu Huiseng Expresses His Opinion</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency said (Various patriotic groups in this city received a letter yesterday signed by the "Sino-Japanese Great Alliance," which said: "Since the establishment of our alliance, the people of China and Japan have discussed and approved it. The resentment of the Eastern Province Incident was caused by the warlords of the two countries. There is no other reason. The intention of the people of China and Japan is to shake hands and become countries of co-prosperity and co-existence in East Asia. As a representative of the Chinese people, you must fully understand this hope. (Original text as is) In order to promote cooperation between the peoples of the two countries, all acts of hostility between the two countries must be cancelled. The organization you preside over that assists the opposing army should immediately cease its work so that our alliance can carry out mutually beneficial affairs between the two countries. We hope that you will accept this good advice, otherwise, for the benefit of the people of the two countries, we will have to take appropriate measures. Best wishes, "Sino-Japanese Great Alliance."" After receiving the letter, Mr. Chu Huiseng, the executive director of the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, expressed his opinion to the reporter, saying that the Japanese people who understand the situation believe that the Eastern Province Incident was caused by the warlords and there is no other reason. This is not false. Since the Japanese people have recognized this point, they should do their best to stop it and immediately withdraw the Japanese army that occupies the Eastern Province. We can immediately shake hands with them. If they are unable to overthrow their warlords and do not withdraw the Japanese army occupying our Eastern Province, then the people of our country will rise up to help our Northeast Volunteer Army. Moreover, the Northeast is not the Northeast of any one person in our country, and the leadership of the Relief Association is not by any one person. Gu Tinglin said, "The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of everyone. Who can refuse to go through fire and water?"</p>

<h3>Dr. Miller, President of Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital, Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dr. Miller, President of the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital and President of the China Division of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, returned to the United States in July this year for business. He returned to Shanghai yesterday on the President Coolidge. He will resume his practice in the Sassoon House clinic soon. Upon disembarking, Dr. Miller told our reporter that he attended the Autumn Council of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists in the United States and visited several hospitals affiliated with the church. He also recruited medical personnel for the newly established hospitals of the church in China. The personnel of the church who came with him this time include Dr. Nasser, who will serve at the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital, Mr. Shi Gaotuo, who will be the manager of the Signs of the Times Publishing House, and Pastor Ji Erde, who will serve at the church in Yunnan. Dr. Miller also said that although the work of his church is in the midst of a global economic panic, the progress made in the past year has been unprecedented.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits on the Shanghai-Taicang Road Results in the Shooting of a Police Officer</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 12:00 AM, a police officer protecting the cable of the Liu Hang Radio Station was shot and killed by bandits in front of a pavilion about six *li* north of the Dachang Station on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Protecting the Cable</h3>
<p>The Liu Hang Radio Station, directly under the Ministry of Communications, had its cables (i.e., steel wires) frequently stolen in the area along the Shanghai-Taicang Road. Therefore, it specially requested the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to assign three police officers and one sergeant from the fourth district of Zhabei to be stationed at the radio station. They patrolled the Shanghai-Taicang Road on bicycles at night to check for cable theft. It is said that they had captured cable thieves several times in the past and sent them to the Fourth District Police Bureau for interrogation and release. The thieves harbored resentment against the police officers and had ambushed them twice with gunfire, but the police officers repelled them.</p>
<h3>Incident Details</h3>
<p>Last night (Thursday) around 9:00 PM, Sergeant Guo Zhenqi dispatched police officers Shi Xingdong, Liu Fangqing, and Jin Changyou on patrol. When they reached the pavilion at the 56th map mark, they were ambushed with gunfire again. Since the police officers had experienced this several times before, they were not surprised. They immediately jumped off their bicycles and returned fire from the fields. The sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. The bandits, outnumbered, were also scattered by the police officers. Later, they rode to Dachang and reported the situation to the Dachang Police Bureau. At 12:00 AM, they returned to their station in Liu Hang. Unexpectedly, when passing in front of the pavilion, the bandits placed stone bars (usually used as seats) in the middle of the road. Because it was dark, the police officers did not see them. The bicycle wheels crashed into the stone bars, and the police officers fell to the ground. The bandits opened fire again. The police officers had run out of bullets in their pistols and could not fight back. Shi Xingdong was shot in the nose and died. The bandits, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled immediately. Police officers Liu and Jin, knowing that their partner had been killed, returned to the station to report the incident. They also informed the dead officer's wife, Mrs. Lu, in Gujia Town, and reported to the Fourth District Police Bureau.</p>
<p>The district chief went to investigate the scene in person around 10:00 AM yesterday and confirmed the incident. He ordered the local security chief to go to the Baoshan County Government to request an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Corpse Observation</h3>
<p>After hearing the news yesterday, the reporter took the Shanghai-Taicang bus to observe the scene. The corpse was lying face down in a pool of blood by the side of the road, head northwest and feet southeast. One hand was outstretched, and the other was clenched. There was a felt hat in front of the head. The deceased was wearing a black wool overcoat, leggings, straight-cut cloth shoes, black velvet socks, and had a shaved head. It seemed that the bullet had not passed through, as the corpse was lying face down and there was a gun hole in the back of the head. The stone bar was still placed by the side of the road.</p>
<h3>Conversation with the Corpse's Wife</h3>
<p>Later, I saw a young woman in white inside the pavilion and knew that she must be a member of the deceased's family. I had the following conversation with her. The corpse's wife, Mrs. Shi Lu, said that she was 21 years old and from Jiaxing. Her parents were still alive. She married Shi Xingdong two years ago and had a daughter who had died. She is currently five months pregnant. Her deceased husband was 32 years old and from Suqian County, Jiangsu Province. His parents, brothers, and sisters are also alive. This morning (yesterday morning), after her husband was shot dead by bandits, a police officer with the surname Jin rushed to the scene. The deceased was not yet dead but could not speak. He only raised his hand to signal. According to onlookers, they heard gunshots at the time, but it was late at night and there were no villages nearby, so they dared not go out to see what happened.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-South Public Bus Company's Exclusive Operating Rights Revoked</h3>
<h3>Due to Business Losses, Suspension of Operations, and Inability to Resume</h3>
<h3>Decision Made After Being Brought up in the Municipal Council Two or Three Times</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-South Public Bus Company suspended operations and cleared its accounts on August 30th of this year due to business losses. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities believed that the public bus business operated by the company was of great importance to public transportation and was of an exclusive nature, so it could not be allowed to be suspended for a long time. After reporting to the Municipal Government for approval, on October 3rd, the company was ordered to complete the clearing procedures and resume traffic before November 30th. If it failed to do so, the exclusive operating rights would be revoked. Subsequently, Mr. Jiang Wanping, the liquidator of the company, replied, stating that after checking the asset and liability status, the existing assets were clearly insufficient to cover the liabilities. According to the Company Law, it was necessary to apply for bankruptcy, and there was no possibility of continuing operations. He could only plead that when inviting tenders for another company to operate, the existing assets should be given a more favorable price or a special permit for reorganization and transfer should be granted to provide relief. The Bureau of Public Utilities believed that since the company had no possibility of continuing operations and the public transportation in Shanghai-South could not be allowed to be suspended for a long time, it requested the Municipal Government to issue an order revoking the company's exclusive operating rights, returning the deposit guarantee, and declaring the contract signed with the Municipal Government on September 18, 1928, and the supplementary contract signed on March 20, 1931, invalid. The Municipal Government submitted the report to the 223rd Municipal Council meeting, which decided that the exclusive operating rights of the Shanghai-South Public Bus Company should be revoked immediately, and the Bureau of Public Utilities should find a way to restore traffic in Shanghai-South. Yesterday, the order was issued to the Bureau of Public Utilities to comply.</p>
<h3>National Art Exhibition Receives Treasures from All Sides</h3>
<h3>Chen Shuren Donates Two Masterpieces</h3>
<p>The National Artist Donation Exhibition for the Northeast Volunteer Army, jointly organized by the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, the Republic of China National Salvation Organization Federation, and the Chinese Painting Society, has been receiving treasures from all sides since its establishment. They are dazzling and beautiful. It is known that Mr. Chen Shuren, a member of the Central Committee, has specially contributed two of his carefully crafted works, "Persimmons" and "Ink Bamboo." The famous scholar Wang Renwen, at the age of seventy, sent fifteen handwritten couplets from Tianjin. Niu Chuanshan also sent many Lianping. Ms. Bao Yun, the wife of the famous accountant Pan Xulun, donated four landscape hanging scrolls. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, also donated two five-foot Zhongtang paintings. Shao Yixuan of Beiping donated two hanging scrolls of flowers. Yu Shaosong, a famous artist from Hangzhou, donated two hanging scrolls of flowers. Ma Qizhou, a famous local painter, also donated two exquisitely mounted paintings of ladies and birds. Famous lawyer Wu Tieshan and famous artists Wang Kuichen, Tang Zixiang, Chen Fuhua, Zhou Zhiyuan, Fang Bu, Hong Shuan, Wang Zuanxu, Zhu Meichuan, Xu Poseng, Fu Dianru, Zhang Tianqi, Di Pingzi, Mei Jing, Xu Xiuzhi, Wang Chunren, Zhu Wenyun, Wei Ruosou, Wu Zhuzhai, Feng Xiyu, Feng Yi, Zou Mengchan, Zhu Zunyi, Huang Suan, Chen Ziheng, Ke Dakui, calligraphy and paintings, and Western paintings numbered in the hundreds.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Milk Disinfection Measures</h3>
<p>At the last meeting of the Health Committee, the Director of the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, proposed a plan to ensure the quality of milk within the concession. According to the opinions of the veterinarians in the bureau, although various measures have been implemented to regulate Grade B milk in the concession, it is still a source of disease. Although bovine tuberculosis is not common in Shanghai, typhoid fever and dysentery may be transmitted through milk. The doctor suggested that the Shanghai Municipal Council establish a new-style disinfection plant to disinfect Grade B milk. The purchase of land, construction, and equipment for this plant would cost about 250,000 taels of silver. However, if a fee of three cents of silver is charged for each pint of milk sent for disinfection, the plant could be profitable and would not need to be funded by taxes. Therefore, Dr. Zhou Deng, Director of the Health Department, requested that this proposal or other good strategies be considered, or that private individuals could be allowed to operate this business. The Acting Director of the Finance Department expressed his deep sympathy for the benefits of disinfecting Grade B milk for hygiene. However, during this time of financial constraints, all temporary expenses should be limited to those that are absolutely necessary for municipal administration. The disinfection plant did not seem absolutely necessary, so he could not support the proposal to build a plant. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Committee stated that if this plant were established, it would seem that the Shanghai Municipal Council would be in business competition with Grade A milk factories. Although the matter is beneficial, it seemed better to allow private individuals to handle it, or that the Grade B factories could jointly operate this business. The Director of the Health Department replied that it was doubtful whether the factories had the financial resources. If the current licensing regulations were tightened, requiring Grade B milk to be disinfected, the result might be to drive the milk factories out of the concession, making them even more difficult to manage. Furthermore, if each factory disinfected itself, the price of milk would increase, which would be inconvenient for poorer users. The bureau would have to send personnel to supervise everywhere, which would be too much trouble. Then a committee member said that the supply of milk in the concession was currently in short supply. He thought that drinking and cooking milk could be divided into two categories so that the disinfection proposal could be implemented. After discussion, all committee members agreed that it was necessary to disinfect milk universally and that it was a profitable business. If the public knew the bureau's intentions, private individuals would be willing to operate this plant. For detailed consideration, a small committee of three should be appointed to review the matter and report back. All committee members should also consider this issue again so that it could be discussed again at the next meeting. The Director of the Health Department should also send the committee a copy of the nationality of the owners of each Grade B factory and the production volume of each factory for reference. This case was submitted to the Board of Directors on the 21st, and the Board of Directors approved the methods adopted.</p>
<h3>Photography Experts Hold Tea Party to Discuss Submission Methods for the Chicago Exposition</h3>
<h3>On-the-Spot Recognition of Submissions: Very Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>The China Travel Service has been entrusted by the Preparatory Committee for China's Participation in the Chicago Exposition to collect photography submissions from China for display in the United States. The company believes that this matter is of great importance, so it has specially hired contemporary celebrities and photography experts to form a committee to oversee everything. The work is progressing very smoothly, and many submissions have already been collected. The company held a tea party at 4:00 PM yesterday on the eighth floor of the Hua An Building to entertain local photography experts and editors of various pictorial magazines. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The people who attended yesterday included Ye Gongchuo, Song Yunpu, Zhou Jianfu, Cao Zuguang, Wang Dafo, Teng Gu, Wang Xiaoting, Peng Wangshi, Hu Bozhou, Liu Shuofu, Li Zunyong, Huang Bodi, Chen Xiaofang, Jiang Xiaojian, Shao Yuxiang, Ma Guoliang, Zheng Wuchang, Zuo Gengsheng, Lang Jingshan, Chen Wanli (who came specially from Hangzhou), Chen Long, Huang Zhongchang, Liu Xucang, Cai Renbao, Zhu Shuren, Xu Zuyin, Daniel North, Hu Boxiang, Zhang Zhenyu, Zhang Zhenhou, Chen Chuanlin, Shao Woyun, Guo Xilin, and more than 30 other people. On behalf of the travel service, Song Chunfang, Zhang Shuiqi, Zhao Junhao, and Zhu Tongjiu welcomed the guests. It was a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Meeting Details</h3>
<p>After the meeting began, Mr. Zhang Shuiqi first reported on the progress of the preparation and collection work. Then, Mr. Ye Gongchuo, Chairman of the Committee, delivered a speech, stating that this photography submission was related to the future of the country and could not be done well by a small number of people. It was not easy to collect everything in Shanghai alone, and transportation was inconvenient and time was pressing. Therefore, he hoped that all experts would come to help devise sound methods to complete this important mission. Regarding the submissions, he should report to everyone that: (1) If the submitter cannot enlarge the photos themselves, they can submit the negatives to the travel service for free enlargement. The travel service will be responsible for returning the negatives in the future. (2) If the submitter enlarges the photos themselves, they do not need to mount or frame them. The travel service will handle everything to ensure that they are beautiful. (3) The travel service will not copy or print the submitter's negatives except to enlarge them for display in the United States. (4) If the submitter wants to sell the submissions, they can mark the Chinese currency price. After the sale, the submitter will receive the original price, minus a handling fee of one-tenth of the Chicago Exposition Preparatory Committee of the Ministry of Industry. (5) If the submitter has other questions that need to be discussed, they can write to the travel service at any time. Then, Zuo Gengsheng, Chen Wanli, Jiang Xiaojian, and others expressed their opinions and discussed the size of the submissions. After a collective decision, all submissions, whether they are famous scenic spots, historical sites, cultural relics, architecture, new construction, items for academic reference, customs, or art works, should be large in size (preferably 20x16) and not too small. It is hoped that submitters in various places will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Recognition of Submissions</h3>
<p>During the meeting, everyone recognized submissions. The maximum number of submissions recognized by one person was over 100, and the next highest was over a dozen. It was agreed that all submissions would be submitted to the travel service before January 5th. In addition, the photos taken by the National Travel Group of Liangyou will be provided as much as possible. All photos from the Times and China Pictorial magazines will also be submitted. Therefore, the results were very satisfactory. The company believes that the time for collection is extremely pressing and hopes that comrades in the photography community in various places will send their submissions to Shanghai as soon as possible to jointly participate in this grand event.</p>
<h3>Grand Occasion of the First Performance of the Chinese Military Band</h3>
<p>The Chinese Military Band, founded by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, has been established for more than four months. The instructors and students have worked very hard and have achieved formal success. They attended the New World Relief for Northeast Refugees Art Fair last night (the 22nd). The entire band consisted of more than 60 people, each with an instrument, and was personally conducted by Mr. Xu Ruhui, the band's instructor. The piece performed was one of the ancient military *naoge* (One Unifies the Mountains and Rivers). The sound was magnificent and majestic, worthy of a great power with a magnificent atmosphere, which is different from other military bands that aim at intensity. Sun Tzu said, "To conquer the whole is best; to destroy it is second best. To capture an army entire is better than to destroy it." From these two sentences, one can know the standards of Chinese military music. The audience was packed, and the applause was thunderous. At around 10:00 PM, the band marched out of the New World, passed through Nanjing Road and Henan Road, and went straight to the headquarters of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, playing all the way. Countless people followed the band to listen. This event added a lot of color to the conference.</p>
<h3>Announcement from the Great Northern and Great Eastern Telegraph Companies</h3>
<h3>Amendments to the International Telegraph Regulations</h3>
<p>The Great Northern and Great Eastern Telegraph Companies announce that, according to news received from their headquarters, representatives of various governments attending the International Telecommunications Conference in Madrid (the capital of Spain) have decided to amend certain articles of the current International Telegraph Regulations.

<p>Code Telegrams:</p>
<p>Class A code words (code words with six to ten letters) will be cancelled. Code words are not allowed to exceed five letters, but there are no restrictions on the spelling of individual words.</p>
<p>Code telegrams are charged at 60% of the ordinary telegram rate. Telegrams exchanged within European countries are charged at 70% of the ordinary telegram rate.</p>
<p>If the telegram contains a mixture of clear language words and code words, it will be charged as a code telegram.</p>
<p>Clear language words are charged at one word for every five letters.</p>
<p>Each code telegram is charged at a minimum of five words.</p>
<p>Urgent Telegrams:</p>
<p>The price of urgent telegrams will be reduced from three times the ordinary full rate to two times (whether clear language or code).</p>
<p>Deferred, Night Letter, Day Letter, and Greetings Telegrams:</p>
<p>The text of these telegrams can be written in any language commonly used for ordinary clear language telegrams.</p>
<p>Except for the newly established regulations regarding urgent and letter telegrams, which will be implemented from April 1, 1933, the remaining newly established regulations will be implemented from January 1, 1934. Once the official text of the newly established regulations is received, detailed information will be sent to you. If you wish to forward the above news to other customers who send telegrams to various countries, please provide the customer's name and address in detail, and the companies will forward it accordingly. With best wishes,</p>
<p>Peng Sen, General Manager of the Far East, Great Northern Telegraph Company, Shanghai</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Inspect School Hygiene</h3>
<p>At the last meeting of the Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Director of the Health Department proposed a plan to conduct medical examinations in various schools. According to this plan, about 40,000 taels would need to be spent next year. Because the amount was quite large and it was a time of economic difficulty, a committee member suggested that this measure could be implemented gradually. At the beginning, it could be started in the schools directly managed by the bureau, especially the elementary schools directly managed by the bureau, and then extended to the subsidized schools. The Chairman of the Committee also said that it was necessary to conduct such inspections in schools. However, if the tax revenue next year and in the future does not increase, the Shanghai Municipal Council's regular expenses will also experience difficulties. Therefore, he could not help but hesitate about this plan, which requires a lot of expense. Then, the Director of the Health Department said that this inspection was originally a matter that should be handled by the municipal health authorities. If it is implemented, the expenses should be included under the Health Department. After discussion, all the committee members believed that this plan should be implemented, especially for the elementary schools directly managed by the bureau. However, they hoped that the financial situation next year would allow this plan or a revised plan to be implemented. However, this matter still needs to be sent to the Health Committee for consideration.</p>
<h3>Shanghai News about the Paris Exposition</h3>
<p>The Paris Exposition, which will be held next year, has now been scheduled to take place from May 13, 1933, to May 29th. This year, the area occupied by the exhibition was already quite large, with a hall of 120,000 square meters and other exhibition halls of 110,000 square meters. However, it was still insufficient, so an additional 10,000 square feet of space will be added for next year's exhibition. The main entrance of the venue has been the same for the past eight years, but it will be replaced with a new design next year, and a garden will be added. The number of exhibitors has been increasing year by year, reaching 7,850 this year, and it is expected that it will increase to 8,000 next year. Therefore, even during this period of economic panic, the affairs of the conference next year will not be affected and will be able to create a new era. It is heard that France and neighboring countries, to facilitate the travel of exhibitors and tourists, will reduce train and air travel expenses by 10% to 50% around May next year to show their preferential treatment. The office of the conference is located at Rue Notre Dame des Victories, Paris. Anyone wishing to participate can write to inquire about everything.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Machine Association Condemns Zhao Jinji Factory for Falsely Claiming Membership</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association sent a letter to the Zhao Jinji Thermos Factory, stating: "We have read the advertisement published by your factory in the 'Shen Bao' on the 13th of this month, which includes the words 'Member of the Shanghai Municipal Machine Association'. After careful examination of the membership application forms, your factory joined this association as a member in January 1929 and voluntarily announced its withdrawal in October of the same year. More than three years have passed, and your membership has long been terminated. How can you publish advertisements that falsely claim membership? Not only is this frivolous, it is also close to rumor-mongering and hinders the reputation of this association, which is illegal. Your recent application to join the association was rejected by the sixth meeting of the sixth session of the Executive Committee. A corresponding letter of warning is hereby prepared. Please pay close attention to avoid any inconvenience."</p>
<h3>Wen Hongen Orders Districts to Be Responsible for Investigating Flower Gambling Dens</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, because flower gambling dens have been rampant recently in the north and south of the city, and ordinary citizens who are addicted to them have ruined their families, has, in addition to specially assigning commissioners to go to various places for secret investigations, yesterday reissued an order to all subordinate district squads and teams, instructing all squad chiefs and officers to comply. From now on, they must step up investigations. If any such flower gambling dens are still found in their respective jurisdictions by personnel dispatched and investigated by the bureau, the district squad chiefs and officers concerned will be held responsible.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Translation Team</h3>
<h3>Recruiting Volunteer Translators</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps Translation Team is a group formed by enthusiastic people from all walks of life in response to the Shanghai War this spring.

However, according to those responsible for railway credit companies, the interest on all railway debts due on January 1st of next year can be paid in full. Also, American public bonds created a new peak today due to enthusiastic buying by investors. Brokers' loans totaled 400 million yuan, an increase of 2 million yuan compared to the previous week.

<p>Yarn and Cloth Market Appears to Be Softening Again</p>
<p>|Year-End Approaches, No Hope for Customer Sales|</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending downward, and the situation appears to be softening again. As the year-end approaches, customers are also handling settlement procedures, hence there is no large-scale development in transactions, and people's hearts are scattered. However, Sichuan customers are slightly purchasing, while the South Bank customers, who have the largest sales volume, have halted due to extremely tight finances and poor market conditions there. Business is becoming increasingly depressed.</p>
<p>(Few Buyers in the Cotton Exchange Market) The cotton exchange market opened this morning. Although the gold market rose, the prices of Indian and American cotton trended downward. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and people's hearts were weak. Prices for each month fell by 5, 6, and 7 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that Sichuan customers had active transactions, and the market atmosphere slightly shook, rising by 2 and 3 qian. At the closing, it weakened and fell by 1 and 2 qian again. The total transactions for the day were统计 at 18,300 bales. It was found that Gengfeng sold 1,550 bales, Minghua sold 1,250 bales, Shenxin Chun sold 900 bales, Tonghe sold 500 bales, and Yukang sold 400 bales.

<p>Cotton Market Gradually Reveals Weakness</p>
<p>The cotton market, which had been strong for many days, gradually showed signs of softening. However, the general buying sentiment remained strong, with no intention of letting go. Only some of the long positions were slightly settled. As for the gold price rising while the Indian and American cotton prices trended downward, the two offset each other. A certain manufacturer completed 9,000 bales of coarse velvet Xihe cotton in Tianjin, priced at 24 liang (Tianjin silver). It has already been loaded onto a ship and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 27th. What the future of the cotton market holds depends on the Indian and American cotton markets and the fluctuations in exchange rates.</p>
<p>(Long Positions Emerged in the Zheng Exchange) The Zheng Exchange market opened this morning. Although the gold price discovered a new peak, the American and Indian cotton prices fell, resulting in a flat sentiment. Moreover, general retail long positions were spit out.

<p>Flour Mills Compete to Dump Near-Term Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the near and far months all fell sharply, especially the near-term ones, which were sold off in competition by Fufeng and Xinda factories, long position holders, and spot sales customers. The downward trend was very strong. The spot sales customers were mainly from Dalian and Tianjin. Dalian's sales volume has been mostly transshipped to Changchun, and the demand was originally sufficient. Recently, it has been reported that as many as 900,000 bags have been shipped out. Currently, it has attracted the attention of Japanese merchants who are competing to sell off the goods, which has been reduced on the feet. Tianjin and other northern merchants will handle the loading of japonica and indica rice, and the sales volume is also sluggish. Moreover, the ocean wheat report is down by 0.03 yuan, and Australian wheat has a huge amount of 3.485 liang with bags included for March and April, which is particularly encouraging and weakening. For these reasons, the near term is more tired than the far term. The morning close for the near term was down by 0.03 yuan, and the far term was down by 0.01 yuan. In the afternoon, the long and short positions covered their positions, and the market stabilized again. The closing prices were December down 0.02 yuan, January down 0.02 yuan, February down 0.01 yuan, March down 0.005 yuan, April down 0.0025, and May down 0.005 yuan, it was said. Northern Merchants Are Also Asking About Guest Indica Rice.</p>
<p>|Min Sales Volume Has Increased, and the Price Has Risen by 0.15 Yuan|</p>
<p>Yesterday, Guest Indica Rice showed more improvement. Three thousand bags arrived from the New Ningxing and other ships, and there are still about 30,000 bags being shipped out. The sales volume is strong. In addition to the continuing loading of goods by the Min Province Fuquan merchants, the northern merchants of Weihaiwei and Yantai purchased a batch of early machine red rice yesterday. A merchant purchased more than 200 bags of Shaobo early machine yuan rice. The Min Province merchant purchased various types of rice, including early machine yuan rice, late machine yuan rice, red machine rice, and oil machine rice. More than 2,000 bags were shipped out throughout the day, with Min merchants accounting for more than half. The intention of the guests to purchase later is still strong. Yesterday, the price of red machine rice rose by 0.15 yuan due to the small amount in stock. Other prices were better by 0.05 to nearly 0.1 yuan. It is reported that Hunan red machine rice was 1,578 bags, priced at 8.45 to 8.3 yuan. Also, 150 bags of oil machine rice were priced at 8.8 yuan. Wuhu yuan rice was 217 bags, priced at 9.75 yuan. Jiangxi Shaobo rice was 150 bags, priced at 6.5 yuan. Also, 100 bags of late machine rice were priced at 8.48 yuan.</p>
<p>According to news from the north, the purchase volume of guest indica rice seems to be gradually increasing because the digestion of white japonica rice</p>

<p>(Old Woman) In my opinion, a talent like the Xu fellow is good. He has an outstanding and refined appearance and is accomplished in literature. Matching him with our Hui'er would be a perfect pairing of a talented man and a beautiful woman, a harmonious union. It's a pity his family is poor; it's not a "suitable match." Unlike the Kang fellow, whose family is wealthy, which aligns with the ancient saying, "Marry your daughter three levels higher." A poor son-in-law is a disgrace! So, I think even though young Master Kang's talent doesn't match the Xu family's, his family is still quite suitable. If Hui'er marries him, she can live a life without worrying about food and clothing. (Old Man) No, no! I know this young Master Kang. Not only is his intelligence mediocre, but I've also heard he's arrogant and has a bad temper, ordering servants around. He's completely a spoiled young master. If Hui'er marries him, they might not have a harmonious marriage! Moreover, a friend told me that this young man, though young, is already addicted to opium. He's made a big mistake that will harm himself for life, and harm his wife and children. They say he spends four or five dollars a day on it, so even though his family has a large fortune, I don't approve of marrying a poppyhead! The Xu fellow is better. When it comes to wealth, although he's worlds apart from the Kang family, it's not like his family is completely destitute. As long as the child is ambitious, they won't be poor for life! (Old Woman) Old man, your idea is wrong. A person only needs to be well-fed and clothed in this world. Who cares about knowledge and learning? If we marry Hui'er to that poor Xu boy, we'll ruin her life. Do you think she'll resent us? It's better to marry her to the Kang fellow. When it comes to bad temper, I think other than poor boys, all the young masters from wealthy families are used to being pampered. They all throw tantrums. As long as Hui'er has skills, she can control him after marrying him. As for the opium addiction, that's even less of a concern. As the saying goes, "A rich man who smokes opium protects his family fortune." He has hundreds of thousands in assets. We should only worry about him not smoking opium, not worry about him spending money. With such a huge fortune, spending three or four dollars a day is nothing. Frankly, he won't smoke himself to poverty in his lifetime. So, I've decided to marry Hui'er to the Kang fellow to be a rich young mistress, and I don't want to send her to the poor Xu fellow to be a withered old woman! Old Master He's thinking was already outdated, and now, after his wife's words, his materialistic mindset was triggered, immediately forming a snobbish view of looking down on the poor and valuing the rich. He silently agreed with a soft, "Mmm..." (Old Woman) Since you agree too, when the matchmaker comes, we'll ask them to inform the groom's family to choose a date for the betrothal. Alas, He Huizhu's happiness, which her life depended on, the source of her fate, the marriage problem, was determined by her parents' outdated, money-worshipping, and despicable thinking, under the traditional, patriarchal values, and her fate was decided.</p>
<h3>Meetings and Refreshments by Guang Yi</h3>
<p>"Meetings" and "refreshments" may seem unrelated on the surface, but if you can observe them closely, I guarantee you'll immediately discover their interrelationship. I can't speak for other places, but in our school, every "meeting" is inseparable from "refreshments." As a rule, from the bell ringing to start the meeting until the closing remarks, there's always that "with delicious refreshments" bit. Frankly, if a meeting didn't have this item, perhaps besides the chairman and committee members, there wouldn't even be half a ghost there. This isn't an exaggeration; the facts tell us so. I remember that day was the day after the Lytton Report was published. The weather was very good, and the sun shone so brightly that every young person's veins seemed to be bursting. The chairman of the International Political Research Association, Mr. X, was really pitiful! In that hot sun, he had to run around, panting, to find the committee members and members to prepare for an in-depth study and discussion of the Lytton Report. Our chairman certainly had some research on the Lytton Report. I personally saw him take the spare time he had from studying movies last night to study the report, lighting a candle after the lights were turned off before going to sleep. He was truly pitiful! How diligent! The meeting time was 3:00 PM. The clever chairman had studied crowd psychology and knew that meetings and refreshments were closely related. Although there were no refreshments now, to ensure the smooth progress of the meeting, he wrote on the notice: "With delicious coffee and refreshments." This "coffee and refreshments" was even written in red, which is also the benefit of studying crowd psychology! The meeting was held. In addition to the committee members and members, non-members also participated. The crowd was so packed that it almost collapsed the XX Hall. Naturally, with refreshments, everything is easy to handle. But, unfortunately, it was a boast! A deceptive trick. Chairman: The meeting has been going on for a while, and I'm getting a little hungry, I think it's best to ask the chairman to speak first... Mr. X with thick lips stood up and said. That's right! Please, chairman, it's best to... The crowd echoed like a swarm of bees. Refreshments! Hurry! A burst of noise erupted. The poor chairman was really in a desperate situation, panting and saying: "Everyone, I'm sorry, I originally wanted to prepare refreshments today, but because there were not enough people, I didn't buy them, so I have to apologize. We'll have them next time!" What? No refreshments, are you kidding me? You... Mr. X, who came prepared to eat refreshments, shouted. XXX Refreshments Damn it XXX So, after a barrage of abuse, the crowd scattered in a puff of smoke. Only our poor chairman was left in the venue, staring blankly at the report. Later, he left too. So, this very lively meeting ended in a riot. Writing this, I think the intelligent reader will no longer deny that "meetings and refreshments" are unrelated. So, I would like to give a piece of advice: in any gathering in the future, if you want your members to attend, it's best if you can follow what I said above one by one. I guarantee you can get "young and old together," perhaps even "all the wise men gathered." There is certainly no doubt about this. Intelligent readers, right?</p>
<h3>Be Careful of Fire? By Zhang Yiping</h3>
<p>As the year draws to a close, the northwest wind every night carries the slogan "Be careful of fire." A family that manufactures children's fireworks moved into the house next door. The people in the alley warned the second landlord not to let this family move in. However, the high rent strangled the second landlord's throat, and in a "compromise," the workshop finally settled down. Who knew that within less than ten days, a fire broke out? The second landlord got a taste of prison life, which was deserved. To whom should we claim compensation for the losses from being burned? It was lunchtime, and the children were jumping on the benches, welcoming the fragrant bucket of plain rice being brought out of the kitchen. Suddenly, a shrill cry entered my ears, followed by the sound of chaotic police sirens. I hurriedly opened the door. The people in the alley, carrying the old and supporting the young, were desperately running out. The young and strong were also carrying boxes of miscellaneous items. I looked up and saw sparks rising from the roof of the house next door. As I turned back into the house, there was loud crying and screaming inside. Outside, the police sirens were blowing chaotically. Suddenly, there was a crashing sound, as if a wall next door had collapsed. The people in the house were all panicked. Some dragged blankets, and some even squeezed towards the gate holding bowls of rice. Because our family was at the end of the alley, after the fire next door raged, there was no way to escape with our lives. I forced myself to calm down and told my family to escape first. I ran upstairs. I don't know where the divine power came from, but I broke the lock on the box under the bed and carried the small box that our family thought was valuable. As I ran out into the courtyard, the flames from our main building were like millions of snakes, choosing people to devour through the cracks in the windows. I rushed out of the gate, and sparks were already on my body. At this time, the fire trucks had arrived. The alley was immediately closed to pedestrians. I had no choice but to take refuge in a Shikumen house in the front alley. Almost all the people in the alley were acquaintances. I jumped onto their drying platform and shouted to my family standing in the open air outside the alley, afraid that they would think I had been buried in the fire. Now that I couldn't leave, I leaned on the drying platform to watch them put out the fire. But at this time, the wind was strong, and in an instant, our house was on fire. The firefighters held the hoses and watered it down. At the same time, they used axes to tear down the nearby walls to prevent the fire from spreading. An hour later, the fire was completely extinguished. A total of five houses were burned. I looked at my own house, mostly collapsed in the rubble. All the remaining items were split and smashed by the firefighters, as if they were searching for something, rummaging everywhere. I leaned on the drying platform and looked at the men, women, old, and young standing in the middle of the street, with nowhere to go, and couldn't help but burst into tears. The second landlord, for the sake of a few more dollars in rent each month, moved in a dangerous tenant, causing the people in these five houses to be displaced (later learned that two people had been buried in the fire) and had gone to the police station to taste the taste of prison life. But the firefighters should not take advantage of the fire to rob, searching as much as possible for the remaining items. Do you know how the victims standing in the street are grateful for your firefighting? But can you say a word? I hope the authorities will consider the suffering of the victims and provide the firefighters with considerable improvements. If this thing can be published, I hope that every time I hear the slogan "Be careful of fire" in the northwest wind, everyone will carefully check the places where fire can easily be left behind.</p>
<h3>Novel: Writing a Letter to a Friend's Wife (Continuation 14) By Qin Shouou</h3>
<p>At this time, my soul is very happy, and my spirit is also very excited; because when the train passed Xiaguan, I had already used five aspirin tablets to solve my fever. Last night, I ate three steaks by myself; however, I didn't feel any taste, like chewing on three blocks of wood. I am working so hard to add to my meals, hoping that before leaving the pass, I will have fully recovered my inherent health and lively spirit. At the very least, when I step into the ranks of the Volunteer Army, I will definitely not even have the strength to fight the Japanese beast soldiers! The motive for my departure this time has been told to you as much as possible 丨 I am sacrificing myself to protect your reputation, as well as the happiness of Dajing and Xiaoqiangwei; of course, it cannot be said to be for patriotism. However, the reason is not just that simple: If I really didn't have some will to protect the motherland, wouldn't it be easiest and most straightforward to sacrifice myself by jumping into the Huangpu River? Why would I have to go to Guanwai in such a roundabout way to seek sacrifice? Alas! Beautiful little piggy! You may be very vague about the real situation of our great Republic of China, right? This can't be blamed on you either. Originally, the female citizens of the Great Republic of China were inherently a machine for selling foreign goods: besides studying decoration, who has ever paid attention to the country? Maybe they don't even know what year of the Republic of China it is! Now, let me tell you! Little brother! Our great Republic of China is really suffering from the third stage of lung disease! If the government is still so chaotic and muddled, and the common people are still so extravagant and dissolute, then within ten years, if the national emblem of the blue sky and white sun can still fly in the sunlight, I am willing to turn into a turtle in my next life for you to see! Just take the January 28th Shanghai Incident as an example. If the Japanese were so tyrannical, unreasonable, and contemptuous of friendly nations, and performed such a farce in the territory of other countries, I dare guarantee that on the morning of January 29th, the young people and adults in the surrounding area would definitely immediately gather at the battlefield. No matter how sharp the Japanese beast soldiers' cannons and how active the planes were, they would also take courage and stand on the front line; and they didn't necessarily have to get guns and cannons, even a bayonet or a wooden stick could be used to fight a desperate battle with the Japanese beast soldiers one after another, chilling the enemy's courage! However, when Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei were being attacked, burned, massacred, and raped one after another, the young people and adults of our great Republic of China fled to the concessions under the protection of imperialism; gathered together to watch movies, patronize prostitutes, play mahjong, play poker, and even many more shameless guys were having so much fun that they forgot the time, lingering on the streets past 11 o'clock, and being caught in large numbers by foreigners and taken to the police station. How can a nation so shameless and bloodless survive in an era where it will perish if it does not compete?</p>

<h3>Film Special: Strange Overseas News: The Mystery of Paul Bern's Suicide By Lin</h3>
<p>Paul Bern, the husband of blonde actress Jean Harlow, shot himself in the head with a gun just two months after marrying Jean. When this news came out, not only was Hollywood shocked, but the whole world was also very surprised. Even the Associated Press sent several special telegrams about it. However, the cause of Paul's death is still unknown. It is said that Jean herself also felt baffled, or knew but kept it a secret. Therefore, people only know that Paul committed suicide, but they cannot find out the reason for his suicide, and this mystery will probably be buried underground with Paul forever. Recently, a Hollywood astrologer, Sareos, claimed to have discovered the reason for Paul's suicide. Sareos is not only an expert in astrological exploration but is also a great mental scholar. He said that he knew about this months before Paul and Jean got married. One day Paul came to visit this great astrologer. It is said that at this time, the root of suicide had already been planted in Paul's mind. Paul was very kind and had a quiet mind, but all kinds of fantasies occupied it. Paul's thinking was very inclined to theology, and he deeply believed that doing good deeds in this life would definitely bring good results in the next life. Paul deeply loved Jean, and no one could stop his spirit of sacrifice. He firmly believed that Jean would become a great actress in the future, but she has not yet gained enough experience, and her talent is still asleep. She needs a great stimulus to awaken her talent. But if a huge scar can be left in her mind, it will definitely enable her to turn the experiences of joys and sorrows in her life into moving works, and Jean's future may be as famous as Duse and Bernhardt. Paul had told Sareos about this idea and claimed that his mission in this world had been completed, etc. After the news of Paul's suicide came out, Sareos sighed deeply, so he determined that Paul's suicide was actually for Jean's future, and he had made this great selfless sacrifice. Sareos's spiritualism has always been believed in by Hollywood, so his conclusion is also believed by the public. Tonight, Santa Claus came from the Arctic Ocean in a reindeer sleigh to various countries. You don't need to go to the company to buy it; I'll send you one first.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on the Style of the Film Industry By Huizun</h3>
<p>A writer has his style; an artist also has a style. Similarly, a movie actor, a bright star, also has a star's style. Janet Gaynor's petite and exquisite; McDonald's magnificent; Norma Shearer's charming to the bone; Seiffert's dashing and handsome; Van Fairbanks' heroic and strong: ... countless Hollywood stars, they all have their own styles. Our Chinese stars don't seem to give us such a concept. For example, if you ask: What is Hu Die's style? What is Ruan Lingyu's style? What are the styles of Jin Yan, Zheng Xiaoqiu, Gong Jianong, Chen Yumei, etc.? Then it is difficult for us to give an answer, because they can play any role, rural girl, modern young lady, student celebrity, promiscuous starlet, gentleman aristocrat, hawker, hero, playboy, everything is possible. Therefore, we have no way to appreciate their style. If something becomes specialized, it is easy to excel; if a star forms a style, it is also easy to show its strengths. But to create a style, you must have extremely precise observation. Directors need to see the talent of actors and give them appropriate roles in the script. The actors themselves also choose roles in the script that suit their talents. In this way, the style of a star can also be created.</p>
<h3>Yang Liuqing's Death By Jibing</h3>
<p>Ms. Yang was a daughter from a prominent Hangzhou family. Due to frustration in love, she once attempted suicide but was rescued. Later, she quietly came to Shanghai to join the film industry. She first entered Tianxing but was unsuccessful, and then was introduced by Mr. Xie Qingping to join Dazhong. This time, she went to Suzhou with Dazhong to shoot on location. Unexpectedly, this beautiful woman died in the "Lone Army" battle. The last happy gathering before Dazhong left Shanghai was at Xinya. Ms. Yang and twelve other actors and staff members of the company exchanged drinks and laughed happily. Before the halfway point of the banquet, a newly arrived actress suddenly arrived, bringing the number of attendees to thirteen. At that time, Wei Xiubao had a phone call saying that he would come soon, but he did not arrive until the end of the banquet. Therefore, the number thirteen could not be changed. Later, Yang Liuqing was injured at Tianping Mountain and was carried to the Gengsheng Hospital by members of the company. Guan Shi diagnosed and treated her. Zhou Shixun was the first to discover that the number of the ward was also thirteen. Because the West considers thirteen to be very unlucky, he remained silent and did not speak. Who knew that this double thirteen would really be an ominous omen?</p>
<h3>A Suggestion to Add a 7:00 PM Show By Fei</h3>
<p>Most movie theaters now, except for a very few, only show three screenings a day, roughly at 3:00, 5:30, and 9:15. I think this is extremely inconvenient for the audience, especially now in winter. For example, the 9:15 show ends at around 11:00 PM. The audience runs from the warm theater to the cold street, exposed to the cold wind, which must be unbearable. Also, for example, people who go to the 5:30 show often have to sacrifice dinner, which is the case for us students. Therefore, I propose that many movie theaters can add a 7:00 PM show. Then we can go after dinner, and the show won't end too late, which is very convenient. It will probably also be better for the business of the movie theaters!</p>
<h3>My Experience Kissing on the Silver Screen By Kang Bing</h3>
<p>Since making films, Neil Hamilton has kissed sixty-seven women, which means he has learned sixty-seven ways to kiss. He is very proficient in this way. According to him, among the many women he has kissed, Joan Crawford is the most tactful, and Helen Hayes is the most genuine. Neil Hamilton said that kissing is not an easy thing to do. When he was performing with Norma Shearer in Strangers May Kiss, he was very worried because Norma was his master Thalberg's wife! So he was very restrained and dared not be too presumptuous. However, he was ridiculed by Norma for this. He said, "Kissing Joan Crawford is the most pleasant. She is very tactful, and she trembles passionately when she kisses her. This seems close to licentiousness, but Joan's attitude is open and unquestionable." He also said, "Kissing Mary Brian gives people another kind of feeling. She is very sincere and has no hypocrisy at all." Regarding Helen Hayes, he said, "She is the most genuine. Her true feelings are simply exhilarating. On the other hand, with Bebe Daniels, there is very little true feeling when kissing her. She is neither as tactful as Joan Crawford nor does she have the true feelings of Helen Hayes. Her kissing is completely dramatic." Mrs. Hamilton is a generous and happy woman. She sees her husband embracing and kissing beautiful women on the screen, and she is not jealous at all. If your aunt is a very fat woman and you give her a girl's bodice, you can imagine how she would react when she received the gift.</p>
<h3>Lianhua Suffers Political Restraint Again By Ming</h3>
<p>The "Three Modern Women," which has been promoted for a long time, has a very strong stimulating effect in the last scene of the major strike. Fearing that it would be disapproved by the Central Film Censorship Committee, eight hundred feet were cut, and the last scene was rewritten and reshot in secret, resulting in the relocation of the set. A large section of the previous four hundred actors was completely sacrificed. It has now been sent to Beijing for inspection and approval, and it will be shown from the 29th, it is said.</p>
<h3>A Local News Item: A Future Star By Qingxia</h3>
<p>Xia Peizhu, she is a lively and clever girl; she is twenty-eight years old, has a beautiful appearance, and is very similar to Hu Die; she has a gentle temperament and is amiable. She is currently studying at the French Concession Chinese Children's Public School. She is intelligent by nature and usually silent and quiet. Since entering the school, she has never asked for a day off, nor has she ever been late, except when it was unavoidable. We can imagine how much she values her studies; and she is very frugal and has none of the habits of modern people. Who is she? She is Xia Peizhen's younger sister—Xia Peizhu. She is very interested in movies; she also hopes that she can appear on the screen immediately; because her sister Xia Peizhen, whenever she returns from shooting on location in other places, always talks about how excellent and moving the scenery there is; and at the end of the month, she also brings home a large roll of banknotes—salary—so in a corner of her mind, she has imprinted a deep impression: "Filming movies is such an interesting thing!" She has asked her family several times to allow her to make movies, but she has been repeatedly rejected; she feels very frustrated and unhappy that she cannot fulfill her long-cherished wish. Recently, it is said that she has obtained the permission of her family and will be allowed to engage in film after graduating from the Chinese Children's Public School, so she has been very happy recently and cannot stop smiling.</p>
<h3>Film Essay: The Honor of Being "Overwhelmed by Favor" By Chen DabeI</h3>
<p>In the film set, before each shot, the director must first order the actors to practice it once. After he is satisfied, he will issue the order to start the camera. Almost this procedure is the same in any film set. The director's temperaments are different. But for expressions that are considered unsatisfactory, no director can vaguely order the photographer to start shooting. The director thinks that your expression is not suitable, and clearly points out your unsuitable points. If you still don't know what your expression is like at that time, the simplest, clumsiest, and most common method is to continuously change various expressions for the director to choose one. Every time you try one, the director shakes his head, and you feel very ashamed. Fortunately, the director is satisfied with the last one. And you also feel "overwhelmed by favor." But when the lighting engineer has adjusted the lights and the photographer is cranking the camera, a muscle on your face suddenly dances involuntarily, and your mind seems to be suddenly oppressed, and the expression you make is a hundred and eighty yards away from the expression you just tried for the director and was considered satisfactory. So the director suddenly orders the camera to stop, all the lights go out. What do you think at that time? Whose fault is it? The director blames you. Who do you blame?</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Joint Meeting of the Abolish War Association</h3>
<p>Discussing How to Stop the Sichuan-Guizhou Civil War</p>
<p>Resolutions Made and Telegraphed to the Central Government</p>
<p>The General Association of the Abolish Civil War League convened a meeting yesterday in Shanghai, gathering representatives from various Sichuan and Guizhou hometown associations to discuss ways to stop the civil war. Representatives from the Sichuan and Guizhou hometown associations, as well as standing committee members of the Abolish Civil War League, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiyi, Chen Zheqing, and Yan Esheng, totaling over fifty people, attended. After the meeting began, Wang Xiaolai, the current standing committee member of the League, presided over it. First, the chairman reported the purpose of convening the meeting today.

As for stopping the civil war in Guizhou Province, we request the Central Government to transfer Wang's troops away from Guizhou and assign them to bandit suppression or recovering lost territories, and not to allow incumbent military personnel to govern the province, strictly implement military-civilian separation, and we also pray for prompt adoption and implementation, without delay, awaiting orders urgently, The General Association of the Abolish Civil War League bows respectfully.</p>
<h3>The National Lawyers Association's Telegram Regarding Opinions on the Resumption of Sino-Soviet Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Regarding the resumption of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, the National Lawyers Association specifically issued a telegram yesterday, the original text is as follows: To all newspapers and people's organizations nationwide: England and France condone Japan, the authority of the League of Nations has been completely swept away, and international treaties no longer exist. Our government, at a time when there is no justice to be found in the world, decisively resumed diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia to promote peace and prosperity in the Far East. Its intention is indeed gratifying. However, international relations only consider interests and do not speak of sentiment. Friends in the morning may be enemies in the evening, and changes are unpredictable. Therefore, those who are good at planning for the country value the way of befriending neighbors, but even more so value the way of self-strengthening. If one cannot strengthen oneself and hopes for the generosity of neighbors, this is certainly impossible. Nowadays, the people of our country take the resumption of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations as a cause for celebration. I believe that having one more allied country in the international arena is certainly a fortunate thing. However, if our country's politics remains unreformed, its economy continues to decline, and even if superiors and subordinates are estranged, and internal divisions are as severe as fire and water, then what we hope from neighboring countries today will still be what we despair of from neighboring countries in the future, and perhaps even more than just despair. I hope that all my good citizens will strive to save themselves and not rely on others in the slightest. This would be truly fortunate. Liu Liumin, Jiang Yong, Yan Yinwu, Dai Tianqiu, Liu Zhe, Standing Committee Members of the All China Lawyers Association, bows respectfully.</p>
<h3>The Paris Exposition Welcomes Chinese Products to Participate</h3>
<p>Paris, the capital of France, will hold the Paris Exposition from May 13th to May 29th of next year. The French Commercial Counselor in China specifically sent a letter to Guo, the Director of the China International Trade Association, yesterday, welcoming the Chinese industrial and commercial sectors to participate. It is said that the association's venue is about 130,000 square feet and it is expected that the number of exhibiting members will increase to 8,000. Travel expenses for attending the exhibition can also be specially reduced by a certain percentage, etc. This is indeed a good opportunity for our country to promote foreign trade and investigate and improve industry. Those who wish to participate can directly contact the association in Paris or first entrust the China International Trade Association to inquire with the French Commercial Counselor in China, who can also provide detailed information.</p>
<h3>Post Office Issues Commemorative Stamps for President Tan</h3>
<p>Starting from January 9th, 1933</p>
<p>According to the post office, the commemorative stamps for President Tan (divided into denominations of 2 cents, 5 cents, 25 cents, and 1 yuan) have been scheduled to be issued on January 9th, 1933, the day of the completion of President Tan's Memorial Hall and Mausoleum Project, by post offices and agencies, and will be available until the end of June of the same year. If, when purchasing, you wish to have the post office's date stamp applied, the post office can also do so. These stamps will have a general usage period of six months after the end of the issuance period, that is, from July 1st to December 31st, 1933. During this general usage period, they can still be affixed to postal items as postage, and can also be exchanged at post offices for ordinary stamps of the same value. If it reaches January 1st, 1934, they will no longer be applicable and will not be allowed to be exchanged, in order to show restrictions. As for these commemorative stamps issued in Xinjiang and Yunnan, they have all been separately overprinted with the words "For Use in Xinjiang Province" and "For Use in Yunnan Province." In addition to being sold in those respective regions, the Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Beiping, and Panyu postal administrations have also issued a small number for sale, for collectors to purchase nearby (all unused with postmarks). However, the postal area for which these overprinted stamps are valid is limited to what is clearly stated on the stamp surface. If you wish to purchase stamps with the Di Hua (Xinjiang) and Kunming (Yunnan) postmarks, in addition to purchasing from the Xinjiang and Yunnan postal administrations, you can also have them purchased on your behalf through the Beiping Postal Administration.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Research Association Actively Proceeding</h3>
<p>Since the success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, it has attracted worldwide attention. The cultural circles in Shanghai have also long been preparing for the establishment of a Soviet Union Research Association. Recently, due to the announcement of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, there is a greater need to intensify research on the Soviet Union in order to safeguard peace in the Far East.

It is heard that the initiators include Liu Yazi, Hu Yuzhi, Li Jianhua, Ye Shengtao, Zhang Zhirang, Mao Dun, Zhu Boying, Qian Xiaoqiu, Shen Zhiyuan, Wang Zhengxiong, Han Liuwen, etc. Those who have signed up to join include people from the education, writing, news, banking, and film industries, and the response has been extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>The Bank of China's Heihe Tax Collection Office Has Not Been Cancelled</h3>
<p>The Bank Has Telegraphed a Reply to General Ma</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that since the northeastern provinces were seized by the Japanese, our country's financial institutions have unfortunately been completely destroyed. Those that can still operate are subject to various enemy constraints. Yesterday, it was reported that the United Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies Office in Shanghai forwarded a telegram from the Bank of China's management, stating that the bank's Heihe office had been closed down. Yesterday, the reporter went to the bank to inquire about the matter. According to Mr. Jin, the bank has a tax collection office in Heihe, acting as an agent for customs tax collection. Since the Northeast was lost, the office has had no taxes to collect. At the same time, the Commissioner of Customs left Heihe, but the tax collection office has never been cancelled to this day. However, the telegraphs from the head office have not been received by that office recently, but remittances can still be sent there. We hope that all sectors pay attention to this. As for General Ma's clever telegram, the bank has already replied to it. The telegram may have had some misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>Directorate General of Posts Telegraphed the Daheihe Post Office to Act According to Circumstances</h3>
<p>Mail to That Place Has Long Been Cut Off</p>
<p>If Truly Dangerous, You Can Leave the Office Immediately</p>
<p>According to information from the Shanghai Postal Administration, although the postal branch in Daheihe is under the pressure of the invading Japanese troops, it is still striving to maintain operations. After the withdrawal of Su Bingwen's army, the situation has become even more critical. The Postal Administration specifically telegraphed the postal staff in the area yesterday, stating that if they feel truly endangered, they can leave the office at any time, because mail to that area has been completely cut off.</p>
<h3>Liu Piguang, Representative of the Northeastern Armies, Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Liu Piguang, Wang Ziyao, Wu Huanzhang, Duan Zhongfan, Liang Detang, and other representatives of the anti-Japanese generals Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, Ding Chao, and Wang Delin of the Northeastern armies, went to Beijing together on the 17th of this month. Liu specially returned to Shanghai by night train yesterday morning because the affairs of the United Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies Office in Shanghai were urgently needed to be managed. A reporter from the Nisshin News visited Mr. Liu at his residence yesterday. According to him, it was reported the other day that Xia Tengfei, representative of General Feng Zhanhai, telegraphed a statement that he would stay in Beiping due to official business and could not go south. Now, Mr. Xia has come south to Beijing. According to Mr. Xia, he never sent such a telegram. He will travel to Shanghai with other representatives within the day to jointly contact various parties.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's News from the Volunteer Army Support Association</h3>
<p>Providing Assistance to Tang Juwu and Narrating Past Events</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association's bulletin yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reply to Tang Juwu's Telegram To Commander Tang Juwu, transferred from Beiping 囗囗囗: Your telegram has been noted. This Association's 78th Standing Meeting resolved to allocate 5,000 yuan, to be remitted to Your Excellency, of which 3,000 yuan was specifically designated to assist the troops of 囗囗囗囗囗 Li Lengran and Sun Guanying, and 2,000 yuan to assist Your Excellency's troops. It was because the representative of Li's troops insisted on receiving the funds in Shanghai, and after repeated negotiations, it was delayed. Having received Your Excellency's telegram and Zhu General's telegram, we will of course send it accordingly. We are sending it by telegram to Zhu General for transfer, of which 3,000 yuan will be allocated to the troops of 囗囗囗囗囗 Li Lengran and Sun Guanying. If that unit still exists, please verify and allocate it; the other 2,000 yuan will be allocated to your army first to comply with the original plan. Also, this Association previously allocated 10,000 yuan when Your Excellency's troops attacked Shenyang, which was remitted to the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to reward Your Excellency's troops and other troops attacking Shenyang. Later, during the Japanese total attack on Liaodong, 5,000 yuan was allocated and remitted to General Zhu for distribution. The money was received by Adjutant Wang Xiangshan. We trust that Your Excellency is aware of the matter. We hereby narrate it for Your Excellency's information. May you exert your utmost efforts. Sincerely, the Standing Directors of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, Zhu Zhuancheng, Li Cishan, Yin Fu, Wu Shan, Feng Shaoshan, Yu Huancheng, Yan Zhifang, etc.</p>
<h3>Reply to Yunnan Anti-Japanese Association</h3>
<p>The Association replied yesterday to the Yunnan Kunming Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, stating: To the honorable founders, We have received your letter delivered by Bao Shaoheng, the representative of the Yunnan Volunteer Army for慰勞, and are pleased to learn all. Your association leaders in Yunnan have great patriotism and concern for the country. We have been looking forward to it from afar and are full of admiration. Mr. Bao arrived in Shanghai on December 17th and came to the Association with Mr. Qian Zizhuang on the 19th, and we had a very pleasant conversation. All the Northeast Volunteer Army organizations in Shanghai have been informed in detail. Regarding your request to forward a telegram to the generals of the Northeast Volunteer Army, we will comply with it after Mr. Bao finishes his work in Shanghai and is ready to depart. The Northeast Volunteer Army has been fighting hard for more than a year, and its achievements are remarkable. The brutal Japanese army is outwardly strong but inwardly weak and will not last long. If they can receive continuous assistance and gradually advance, it will be possible to recover the lost territories in the near future. We hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up and work hard together to overcome the difficulties. This Association will fulfill its responsibilities and work together with you all. We specially report this to you, and we hope you will take note of it.</p>
<p>###劝阻救护队 Advising Against the Rescue Team</p>
<p>This Association previously replied advising against the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team's preparation to go to Guanwai [outside the pass, i.e., Manchuria]. Yesterday, it received a letter from the Xiamen Northeast Volunteer Army Overseas Chinese Rescue Team requesting guidance to facilitate their departure to Guanwai, etc. The Association specially summarized the facts and replied in a letter, stating: To those who replied, We have received your letter of December 13th and learned that your team has contacted overseas Chinese to organize the Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team. Your enthusiasm and ambition are deeply admired. However, the weather outside the pass is cold, with ice and snow everywhere. The climate is very different, and it is definitely not suitable for southerners. Moreover, the Volunteer Army's operations are unpredictable, and rescue work is extremely difficult to start. Instead of being hindered temporarily, it is better to be careful in advance. Our Association has a more accurate understanding, so we are reporting the facts to you. We ask you to think deeply and postpone your departure for now.</p>
<h3>Hanyeping Company Held a Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Content of the Discussion Was Not Allowed to Be Disclosed</p>
<p>Various Groups Are Still Actively Opposing</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Hanyeping Mining and Iron Company sold a large amount of iron sand for manufacturing military supplies to the Japanese. Various groups in Shanghai have risen up to discuss countermeasures, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00, the company specifically held a board meeting at the company on Sichuan Road. Sheng Zecheng, Sheng Pingchen, and others attended. The meeting ended at around 7:00. As for the content of the meeting, the company is strictly maintaining secrecy.</p>
<p>The United Association of National Salvation Groups held an emergency meeting yesterday and resolved to petition the Central Government to reorganize the company, nationalize it, thoroughly rectify it, and severely punish Sheng Zecheng, the general manager of the company. The National Goods Factory United Association also telegraphed various departments of the Central Government yesterday, requesting a detailed and thorough investigation and severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Training Fleet Returns Home</h3>
<p>Japanese Residents Present Detailed Chinese Map</p>
<p>Visiting Qiyakou to Observe Our Waterways</p>
<p>After the Japanese Navy training fleet, consisting of the cruisers Yakumo and Iwate, arrived in Shanghai under the command of Commander Hyakutake, the officers and soldiers of the ships visited the war ruins in Zhabei and Jiangwan for several days and toured Nanjing Road and other places. Japanese residents in Shanghai held a meeting at the 63 Garden to welcome them. Commander Hyakutake was very busy with meetings and banquets with various parties and visited the commander of our country's First Fleet. Yesterday morning, the soldiers of the two ships freely toured and shopped in the city. At 5:00 pm, they all returned to the ships. The Shanghai Japanese residents' militia specifically presented a detailed survey map of Shanghai and a map of the upper Yangtze River to the officers and soldiers of the two ships. They are scheduled to set sail from Shanghai at 1:00 pm today and return to their home country. When sailing out of Wusong, because the Japanese army during the Shanghai war relied on the landing of the 11th Division at Qiyakou, the officers and soldiers of the team must cruise to Qiyakou and study the waterways there, and how the army landed, before returning to the East. Our country's doors are wide open, allowing foreign ships to freely sail and inspect important military passes in the interior without obstruction, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Customs Bonds for Exchange of New Bonds Extended for Another Six Months</h3>
<p>Nanjing Telegraph: The Ministry of Finance has issued short-term customs bonds for 1930 for the exchange of new bonds. The extended period for exchanging new bonds will expire by the end of this year and will be extended for another six months, until June 30, 1933.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Great Shanghai Rubber Factory Resume Work</h3>
<p>Waiting for Mediation of the Conditions</p>
<p>More than 200 male and female workers at the Great Shanghai Rubber Factory on Datupu Bridge and Xietu Road announced a strike due to their request for double pay for December not being met. They also put forward nine conditions. After persuasion from party and government organs yesterday, they all resumed work. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Petitioning the Party and Government) The striking workers sent representatives Sun Yuanqun, Chen Heshang, Wang Xianfu, and others, more than ten people in total, to the city party headquarters to petition, along with Chu Chengdong and Lu Ganhuа, the directors of the First District Rubber Workers' Union, requesting a speedy mediation. Li Weixiong of the Civil Training Section met with them and indicated that he had received the conditions put forward by the workers and agreed to mediate them, but hoped that the workers would resume work immediately. Then the representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, where they were met by Zhu Guilin of the Third Section, who also agreed to investigate and handle the matter after investigation.</p>
<p>(Persuasion to Resume Work) After receiving the workers' petition, the party and government organs sent Li Weixiong from the city party headquarters and Zhu Guilin from the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate at 3 pm, and persuaded the workers to resume work first and wait for the conditions to be mediated in accordance with the law. However, the workers refused to resume work because the factory posted a notice setting a deadline for dismissal, which they considered an intentional pressure tactic. The party and government representatives ordered the factory to automatically withdraw the notice, and all the workers then complied with the persuasion and resumed work at 4 pm.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Sanyou Factory Attacked Again</h3>
<p>Two Workers Seriously Stabbed with Knives</p>
<p>The Union Petitions the Municipal Government to Demand Investigation</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Company in Yinxiang Port, Pudong has been dragging on for a year and has not yet been resolved. The workers are still living in the factory, waiting for a judicial resolution. On the 15th of this month, workers Wu Songshou and others were attacked. At around 11:00 pm the day before yesterday, the workers in the factory were sound asleep, when a number of people broke into the factory through the back door in the dark, holding iron rulers and sharp weapons, and rushed to the workers' bedrooms, attacking anyone they encountered. All ten workers living in the factory were awakened from their sleep and fled in a panic. Worker Xu Dejing was stabbed twice in the leg, and blood flowed like a waterfall. Zhang Baozhong was stabbed three times in the right arm and leg and was seriously injured. The Fifth District Fourth Precinct and the security team stationed in the factory immediately sent armed police to hunt down the attackers, but the perpetrators had already fled upon hearing the news and could not be apprehended. The injured were taken to Yangshupu Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. The Seventh District Cotton Weaving Workers' Union convened an emergency meeting of workers at the factory yesterday morning and decided to send representatives Fan Bangyong, Wang Chuncheng, Sun Shouming, and Leng Shimо to the municipal government with a document to petition, requesting a thorough investigation and assistance with their livelihood. After the municipal government received the workers' petition, it immediately replied, "Your petition has been noted. Yang Changlin and others dared to carry weapons in the dead of night and break into the factory to kill workers, causing Xu Dejing and Zhang Baozhi to be seriously injured. This is extremely illegal. The Public Security Bureau is ordered to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrators. The district office is ordered to do its best to protect the safety of the workers. In addition to the order, the union is notified and allowed to request the local district office to send a team to protect them at any time to prevent accidents. This is the approval, Mayor Wu Tiecheng."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industries Will Investigate Zhejiang Industries</h3>
