<h3 id="c1">論日政府承認僞組織 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>元·</p>
<p>日人對於承認僞組織。自其着手準備以來。急轉直下。大有迫不及待之勢。乃臨到實行正式承認之關頭。而忽持審愼考慮之態度。樞密院於初步審議後。諮詢日皇。復特命審查員九人。作再度之審議。今日鄭重如此。其果於毅然急進之餘。尚有多少顧慮。所謂臨事而懼者乎。夫以如此重大複雜之問題。吾人遂認日政府必將一意孤行。毫不回顧者。當不其然。但以事實觀察。日於承認决心。確已早具。即其所認爲可以顧慮之點。亦已深思熟察。而早有布置。然則今日樞密院之審愼考慮亦不過再加一番周密的計議。而初非於旣定之事實。有所變更。可斷言也。</p>
<p>蓋自日本一手造成滿洲僞組織以來。蓄謀併吞。承認爲其必經之步驟。但亦自知承認必爲世界所反對。於是一方盡力掩蔽僞組織眞相之宣傳。一方以種種手段。試探美與國聯各强國之意思。如武籐特使之派遣。内田外相在國會之演說。與近日閣議决定即日承認之宣傳。皆爲其試探之表示。然而美與各强。始終默爾。絶不稍露口風。日人遂認美與各强之始終不表示。含有屈服之意。試觀其近日報紙。多載列强知難而退之樂觀語。可見其非運動已有把握。即已深知國際間之内幕。不於此九一八紀念之際。急速承認。又將等待何時。此事實上所告於吾人者也。</p>
<p>然而日人如此承認僞組織。美與列强。將如何應付。吾人姑且不問。日本如此破壞國聯會章。蔑視九國公約非戰公約及一切國際公法。將於世界發生若何重大之影響。自爲世界各國所共同承受。世界各國果重視此種影響。而認爲足以障害和平者。自必急籌所以共同有效之制裁。而初非一國之事也若我國者。關係非他國比。惟有一致誓死否認日人所將承認之僞組織。夫滿洲僞組織之釀成。孰不知爲日人一手所包辦而可諉爲滿洲之民族自决。與地方領袖分離運動之結果乎。所謂僞組織之新國家者於其新國家之形體。絲毫未備。近且徧地義軍。僞組織搖搖欲墮。此種情形。新國成立之要素何在。而可諉爲不悖乎承認之條件乎。僞組。織宣布而後。我國雖未加以討伐。然固猶是中國領土之一部。東三省固猶未脫離其母國。於此而承認之。非破壞我領土之完整乎。國際間之通例。所謂承認新國家者。即承認其爲國際團體新進之一員必各國都能承認。而後成爲國家。若僅一國悍然承認。於僞組織又奚益乎。然則日本承認之理由安在。其所託詞。爲建設中外安全之樂土。爲保障和平解决事實上之糾紛。此皆爲其對各國之門面語。而其實在之理由。則不外滿洲爲日人之生命線一語而已。然亦思滿洲獨非吾國之生命線乎。日人圖毁滅人之生命。以自保其生命。而謂吾國人。甘心抛棄自已之生命。以鞏固人之生命乎。吾國人而果自知生命之危險。則今日惟有齊心一致。以反抗日本僞組織之承認。據東京電訊。蔣公使爲日政府將承認滿洲僞組織。往訪荒木内田。交換意見。荒木謂中國對日政策。今後改善局勢之唯一途徑。在中國人忘却東三省及上海事件之前事。採行更友好之政策。内田亦謂中日之親善。應與滿洲國問題。另行考慮。滿洲國問題。係滿洲事變中别個發展。中日均應從新立脚地討論。可見陸外二相。早已置滿洲問題於不論不議之列。而陸相并希望我國人亦將滿洲問題。置於度外而忘之。嗚呼。吾國人縱無心肝。能忘却此慘。酷巨變之痛耶。日本非根本上變更其已定之方針。則日政府縱有何種極良好之政策。我政府縱有何種極遷就之好意。而欲使我國人。忘此慘酷巨變。非特今日有所不能。竊恐將永永不能忘耳。日果承認於此九一八紀念之時。則今日第一次開始九一八紀念。即增加一更可悲痛之紀念。而謂我國人能忘之耶。吾國人將僅此不忘而已耶。</p>

<p>台維斯杯之餘波　柯顯未曾赴美、今已四年、此次渡大西洋、乃與梵恩斯一决雌雄、究竟誰高誰下、法人謂當時在台維斯杯賽中之失敗、情形不同、蓋法國已三比一勝美、保持銀杯、此第五組勝負得失、已無關輕重、故梵恩斯當時之獲勝、重視者不多、今者眞實功夫已見、無所强辯矣、</p>
<p>台杯糾紛之眞相　且當時法美台維斯杯决賽、因梵恩斯之勝柯顯、益增美國隊之懊喪怨忿、决賽第一日　美全失二單打、第二日挽回雙打一分、故第三日如能全勝二單打、卽奪回銀杯最後二單打、巴羅屈拉先戰愛律生、第一第二兩盤、愛律生連以六比一、六比三勝、但巴回勝三四兩盤以六比四、六比二、打成二比二平手、第五盤决賽、愛律生以五比四局居先、且第十局、愛再勝一分、卽勝全局、巴發球、全場一萬二千人、皆爲巴氏危、第一記球觸網中、此第二記將定巴之命運、球拍起處、依愛律生之觀察、球在發球方界線外數寸、方以爲其已獲勝直趨向巴握手然回顧視線人並未呼球「出界」、裁判從之、愛律生此時雙止發呆、怨忿萬分、轉喜爲恨、觀衆大譁、愛律生恨極、以致不能管束出球、竟反以七比五失敗、美國台維斯杯之一線生機、爲此視綫員所斷送、不亦慘乎、今年之台杯、究竟法勝美勝、輿論界對之、尚成爲未决之懸案也、</p>

<p>滿鐵事業</p>
<p>溯自去年九一八事變以來、日人已由经濟文化之侵略、進而爲占領之行爲矣、然爲之先驅者、固仍以經濟文化爲先河、而操其責任者、亦即滿鐵會社、（南滿鐵路公司）吾人固亦知日人之於東三省、向有四頭機關之設置、一關東軍司令部、掌軍務、一關東廳、掌民政、一領事館、掌外交、一滿鐵、即掌經濟文化之事業者也、在九一八事變之前、假面具猶未揭破、故四機關中、軍事民事外交方面、尚留惺惺之態、獨滿鐵則以商業經營爲護符、公然進行、舉凡鐵路之外、一切附屬事業、無孔不入、國人多爲震驚、而或不能詳也、歲月居諸、事變迄今、已届一年、迥溯失地之痛、流離之慘、乃愈不能不加以研究、兹特擇要述滿鐵事業、俾國人知所懲毖焉、</p>
<p>滿鐵事業之發生、蓋源於日本之得南滿鐵路權、蓋日人於日俄戰勝以後、繼中東鐵路南滿段而得之者、且申安奉之約、並及吉長之通朝鮮·營口之築支線焉、</p>
<p>本來、南滿安奉、雖爲日人所揷足、然均當有相之年限、至袁氏稱帝之際、提出二十一條、乃改南滿安東爲九十九年、並提改訂吉會協約、二十一條雖未經我承認、日人用心之亟可知、再則民國二年、又有五鐵路須借日欵建築之提議、一、四洮、二二○哩、一、開海、一二三哩、一、由吉長之長春線洮南、一八○哩、一、吉海、一一二哩、雖長洮吉海可借外欵、然先必得日之同意、則其併吞之意、亦復昭然若揭矣、</p>
<p>因滿鐵之敷設、而後有滿鐵會社、滿鐵會社旣爲經濟文化之策源、則自肆力於經營南滿鐵路、浸至於東省其他之關係鐵路、以及於其他之附屬事業、今本文旣專述滿鐵、姑捨日本對滿蒙全部鐵路之整個計畫、而專言與滿鐵有關者、事實上、日本之全部計劃、凡已經實現者、亦可謂無不與滿鐵有關也、</p>
<p>東省各路、除與日本有關外、别有瀋海·（國營）吉海·（官民合辦）呼海·（官民合辦）齊克·（官民合辦）鶴立岡·（民營）開豐·（民營）齊昻·（官民合辦）打通·（北寗支線）錦朝·（北寗支線）北寗新瀋段·（國有）中東·（中俄合辦）穆陵·（中俄合辦）北寗·（英借欵）按之則自辦者百之二四·二、英俄關係百之三七、日本有關者百之三八·七、而即以南滿一路言之、已遠勝於其他各鐵路、蓋南滿前年運貨一千五百九十六萬噸、而其他合計、亦僅一千八百萬噸、已爲百分之八十九矣、此外、旅客、南滿爲一千零五十七萬六千人、其他十路、合計亦不過一千六百二十七萬六千人、比例相差、亦正有限、蓋等於百分之六十五矣、若再加以其他日本關係之各路併計、則其勢力之雄厚、寗可勝計乎、南滿鐵道會社、剏始於一九零六年、蓋日人自得中東路長連段之繼承權而設立者、按之原約、中東鐵路根據於光緒二十六年之借約、路歸道勝經營、故合同内有中政府五百萬兩之股本、且八十年後、全部財産、無償歸還中國、十六年後、中國得出資收回之、路線於長春至大連外附有旅順營口間支線八十六里、安東奉天間支線百六十二里、事實上不過鐵路借欵之商約、而日人得之、乃雄圖厚殖、積極進行、我政府亦迄未顧及主權、加以裁制、馴致尾大不掉、以成侵略之先鋒矣、蓋滿鐵資本、日金二萬萬元、由日政府以路産鑛産等作爲資本之半數、其餘半數、則在日本拓集商股、即由東京移至大連、於一九零七年四月一日、開始接收辦理、越十二年、又擴張股本至四萬四千金元、官股商股各半、各四百四十萬股、其所經營者、大連長春段四三七·五哩、支線周水子至旅順三一·六哩、大房身至柳樹屯三·六哩、大石橋至營口一三·四哩烟台至烟礦九·七哩、撫順線三·八哩安奉線一七零·九哩、共計六七零·五哩、而其位置聯絡尤互相犄角得握滿蒙交通之實權焉、</p>
<p>南滿路外四洮鐵路支線、達於通遼合二六四·八哩滿鐵投資三千二百萬元、正金五百萬元、難爲我國國有鐵路、而以借欵關係、一切幾盡操之日人、總務工務車務三處、亦由日人任處長、而駛用之車輛、亦多自南滿鐵路賃之、可以知滿鐵之關係矣、</p>
<p>洮昻長二二四·零哩、以其在北滿、位置衝要、故日人蓄意圖之、此路名爲由中日合辦之東亞公司所承包、實則資本即出於滿鐵之墊欵、計日金一千八百萬元、包約訂明、完工還欵、六個月不還、即改爲借欵、其後我無還欵、遂改成借約、且由滿鐵指派理事四人云、</p>
<p>吉長凡一二七里、於光緒三十三年、商訂借欵條約、允日人投資半數、在借期三十年中由滿鐵經理之、於是路權遂入於日人之手、名爲國有、實際均由滿鐵主之、行政組織中、並有所謂滿鐵代表者、與局長並行、此外運輸工務會計三處、亦均由日人任之焉、</p>
<p>吉敦鐵路、凡三六五華里、更向東展、便達朝鮮之會寗、以迄於清津港、故亦得謂爲吉會之一段、其建設契約、於民十四、亦由滿鐵承包、日金二千四百萬元、吉會爲東北國防最有關係、而爲民衆所力加反對者、然旣至敦化、則接軌便通會寗况尚有天圖路、由天寳山至圖們江上之三峯、隔江與朝鮮會寗鐵路相聯絡乎、天國路由另一公司辦理、資本日金四百萬元、吉林省府與東方拓殖公司各半、至實權則又操之日人者也、</p>
<p>穩城爲東三省輕便路之一、長十二萬四千密達、資本五十七萬、滿鐵居十之七、本溪湖煤礦居十之三、亦滿鐵勢力之所及也、外此金福鐵路、在金州半島日本租借地以内、全綫一零二公哩、幾爲日本之鐵路矣、</p>
<p>南滿事業、除鐵路外、包羅萬象、無微不至、經濟方面、有機車廠船舶港海殖産礦業鍊鐵郵電等、文化有初等中等專門各學校及圖書館、外此尚有中央事業所地質調查所、理學研究所、農事試騐所、獸醫研究所、滿蒙資源館等、其各種投資、前年已至六萬七千一百七十五萬餘元矣鑛物以撫順煤鑛爲最巨、藏量十億噸、每日産煤一萬七千噸、投資日金一億三千萬、礦區縱一里、横四里、又烟台寛城子之煤鑛、亦歸滿鐵直接經營、其間接投資者、亦尚有之、其製鐵爲鞍山鐵廠、在鞍山站、有英德式鎔鐵爐三台、日出一千二百噸、又有選鑛及燒鐵之設備、發電力二萬六千基羅華脫、外此附屬之硫酸阿靡尼亞工塲、煤焦油蒸溜工塲、木精工塲、納夫太林工塲、硫酸工場、煉瓦工場、無不具備、蓋日本所短者惟鋼鐵、故滿鐵不惜銳意經營、用爲外庫耳、</p>
<p>港海部年耗日金六千九百萬元、船舶資年耗日金四百萬元、蓋即經營開發大連灣者、築有四千一百公尺之防波堤、可容二三萬噸之巨船三十艘、遂爲東亞第一良港、此外甘井子·旅順·營口·等港、亦以地勢關係、同爲滿鐵所經營、惟航業方面、一九二二年後、即移交大連汽船會社辦理之、滿鐵直接經營之工廠、略如上述、舉凡機械、發電·製油·火藥·瓦斯·硫酸等原料製造、幾無不具備、而其間接投資於東省日人工廠者、尤難勝述、約略言之、凡玻璃毛織製糖藥材採木汽船、工程保險信托交易所等、咸有關係、不暇詳舉也、</p>
<p>文化事業、滿鐵辦有醫科大學、各滿洲敎育專門學校南滿工專各中學·各女高中·各實業學校·各補習學校·幼稚園·大連奉天之圖書館、及其他圖書館幼稚園、凡五十餘所、初小三百九十八所、中學八十六所、專門以上五所、而其研究宣傳之出版幾過萬種、</p>
<p>地方設施、亦滿鐵得有特許權者、凡大連之市街經營道路橋梁堤防公園市場屠宰醫院療養消防種羊養鷄牛乳等、亦率歸其經營、其維持費出於人民之市稅、而由滿鐵補充之者、且南滿安奉之附屬地、亦由其收買、即地方行政權、亦歸其管理、蓋充類盡義、滿鐵區不僅爲一鐵路公司、而成爲地方機關、日人在東省之經濟策源地、彰彰明矣、</p>

<p>— 景·記·</p>
<p>國聯調查團初到上海時、朱子橋將軍原準備招待他們　次·並約相老人參加。相老人囑準備一度話、請胡剛復先生届時代表宣佈。後來招待提議打消，所以準備的詞留到今天，述個大意。</p>
<p>「國聯調查團，始終維護正義，不爲日本的虚僞宣傳所欺：那麽，我中國的人民代表，很願竭誠表示歷來愛好和平的精神，並宣示今後積極自衛抵抗到底的態度。</p>
<p>中國自古，酷愛和平：不但希望生在和平中·且常準備死在和平中。諸君如嘗瀏覽中國史傳、必知六朝時的生塋風俗，許多文人學士，歌詠這在生時準備着的墓地：甚至於行住在那生塋裏面，以爲曠達，號稱解人，這種風俗，是個鐵證：可見中國人民在死裏還求和平，何况尚活着那有不求和平的理呢？此種見解實中國人民的普通心理：和傳襲的和平精神。諸君旣爲正義而來華，請便調查滬淞戰事遺跡！須知所炸燬者爲中國商店：所蹂躪者爲中國農田：更須知有無數無辜中國老幼婦孺爲日本正式軍隊所慘殺！諸君經過日本，有此現象没有？我將提議保存閘北一帶被燬戰跡，永不改建，作爲一種紀念區域，使謀世界和平的會盟如國聯軍縮等，有所借鏡！</p>
<p>感謝諸君爲正義努力！我中國人民絶不乞諸君作左右袒！我已爲和平而犧牲，將爲和平謀保障，效忠和平而自衛到底！」</p>

<p>丨青島歸客談丨</p>
<p>蒼翠的葉蓋，從浮船上能使漁者望見了重引起久别後的愉快：碧茵的舖地，偶雜着幾朶野花·蓋在沙鷗圍飛的海灘的黄沙上一般，在船上是望不見房屋，祗有這重疊的色彩。在夕陽西歸的時候，或許可見晚霞從山顚上反射下的紅光罩在上面，和孩子們在海邊嬉戲。這裏就是青山：一座面海背山的小村落·住了二三百户被丈夫的罟魚生涯所抛在家裏度孤衾生活的妻子們，和小部份的做賣買的男人們以及老殘幼弱所佔据着。在青山裏是没有思想的進步，也没有禮敎的崇拜：他們所有的是需要，因需要而工作，而度着天天同樣的生活。</p>
<p>然而需要有時有了缺陷，不能使伊們感到滿足。丈夫去捉魚了，大的或是小的船，成羣打夥的去浮海了，一去就是十天八天，甚至二月三月，把年青的婦人們抛在一邊。因此在這裏伊們爲了需要而創了一個别個村落所不敢做的事情，伊們招待和留宿不相識的男子，如果丈夫不在家的時候。</p>
<p>丨啊，嫂子！有茶給喝一杯吧？走累啦。一個性慾衝動的男人，看到這一家的門上没有貼着烟盒中的畫片，就會知道伊正在做着孤獨的夢：可以去勾搭起來，在兩三元的代價下。</p>
<p>伊們是很剛健的，奶和臀都富有曲線，雖然一雙小足。伊們的子女雖都有一個父親，然而他的血綂是無從深究的。</p>

<p>丙·丁·</p>
<p>丨人們的模範丨</p>
<p>昔人常拿　鰈去形容戀愛，其實最富變愛的，要推蟲類：蟲最能鳴，不是唱變歌麽？蟲最能飛舞，不是跳舞麽？蟲最能交尾，不是實行「同居之愛麽」？蟲最能鬭，不是爲了雌性而决鬭麽？甚至一生一世的厮守在　質海綿裏面，永不願勞燕東西，像産於地中海裏的「偕老同穴」，人們那裏及得來它們始終不變的變愛丨</p>
<p>動物學家說：昆蟲類的雄性，體内也有睪丸，輸精管，精囊，射精管：雌性也有卵巢，受精囊，輸卵管，黏液腺，陰道：構造非常完備。所以我們在夏秋裏常常瞧見蒼蠅背蒼蠅，蜻蜓咬蜻蜓一回把戲：要是它們不知變愛，第一：不會這樣親蜜：第二：外國人所說：兩隻蒼蠅過了三個月，子孫蕃殖起來，也不至於要繞地球數十周了。還有螞蟻的戀愛，是在一定的時候：到了這時候，大家生了翅膀，在空中跳舞，便舉行結婚禮了。在别的時候，倒各自安心工作，不如人們隨時要戀愛咧。</p>
<p>蝴蝶，瓢蟲的美麗，是戀愛的象徵。蟋蟀的夫唱婦隨，牢守在一處，可說是蟲類中的梁鴻孟光。壁虱，跳蚤，鎭日地在床上談戀愛，習跳舞。知了，絡緯，聒聒兒，金鈴子，日夜來唱戀歌艷曲，比現在女學生唱「妹妹我愛你」還要起勁。只有蜉蝣和蠶蛾，享受戀愛的滋味最少，可說是蟲天愛河中的不幸者丨</p>

<p>從天上航空的飛機到告地狀的乞丐，無一不以「ＸＸ救國」爲口號。爲了他們救國救得起勁，切實地去考察他們一下，我終於没有找出一個眞誠救國的人。</p>
<p>勸人救國，和自已救國，當然是國民的義務。爲什麽救國要等人來勸，這是一個問題，因救國而各結其團體，而各救其國，這是又一個問題：救國救在那裏，從那裏救起，這是較上述尤其重要的第三個問題。</p>
<p>救國的活動，在報上領敎過了：救國的人物，也曾瞻仰過了。前者爲增多頭銜，後者都是汽油的耗費者，試以「汽車救國」四字，來贈諸位勞心瘁力的救國要人，如何？</p>
<p>最近，在報紙上，與救國事業同樣地呈在我們眼前的：「實業衰落」，「國民失業」，：：：無一不在仰賴諸君的救濟，我很希望諸君分些救國力量來救濟社會罷。</p>
<p>救國不事空談，靠了幾位汽車主人奔走，不救的還是不救，社會旣不景氣，個人經濟因之發生恐慌，自救不遑，那裏能救國呢，現在的救國要人，不注意到這一點，誰還配談救國？</p>

<p>嫂子！快開門吧！兩手捧了兩個大西瓜，太陽裏眞站不住了。」門外有人在呼喚。</p>
<p>「對不起，請你站一會，我便來開門。一芬若在樓窗上答應，忙卽奔下樓來。</p>
<p>在這頃刻之間，袁團長的腦筋裏，許多思想，像電光，像飄風，像夏雲，起了無數而很迅速的變化。他不懂樓上的什麽人，門外的又是什麽人，芬若是名義上的孀婦，抑是事實上的孀婦？他可憐芬若，妬恨芬若，疼愛芬若，他不知道自已該怎樣維持他原有的中心思想，他更不知道如何應付目前的環境，迷離惝恍身不由主地不等芬若下樓而先去開了大門。</p>
<p>「呀！是你？」王先生驚異得把臂抱着的兩個大西瓜，掉在地下而破碎了。</p>
<p>「你是誰」？袁團長莫名其妙，除了這一句問話以外，再也找不出第二句話。</p>
<p>芬若已下樓，見一切的秘密，完全洩露在王先生面前，也不知怎樣是好，反而去拾取破碎的西瓜。</p>
<p>「你是袁團長？」王先生也定了一定神，從袁團長頭上到脚，仔細地看了兩遍，還不敢確定，所以再問一句。</p>
<p>「我是袁團長，你是不是賣西瓜的？」袁團長也問。</p>
<p>「快進來再說話！」芬若不再拾取碎西瓜，而把王先生拉到裏面，關上大門。</p>
<p>「現在紀念碑落成典禮的預定時間，已過了一小時：聽說縣長公安局長等剛才到城裏去迎接團長，撲了一個空，已回來了，還在那裏恭候着團長到會去舉行典禮呢。」王先生忠實地報告，他說話的時候，不時把眼光在袁團長與芬若之間閃爍地掃射，似乎獵狗一般，想偵出一些特别的意味。</p>
<p>「王先生，袁團長是伊的親戚，丨說着把嘴唇向摟上挪了一挪丨他順便來望望伊的病情，無論如何，請你不要張揚出去，這是我重託你的。」芬若幾乎哭泣至誠地懇求王先生代守秘密。</p>
<p>「嫂子有吩咐，鄙人一定照辦，我並且想定了：但是無論如何，袁團長至多再請等待半小時，務必要到會，因爲今天的典禮極隆重，還有許多來賓要演說，再遲必時間侷促了呢。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>穿穿土布長衫，原是我們有筆階級的家常便飯，西洋呢絨穿不起，綾羅綢緞，價亦昻貴，（今年稍微賤些）只好着着土布長衫，甩東甩西，本算不得一件事，若是有産階級，或有相當地位的人，假定請他着了一件土布衫，就覺出不得門，見不得朋友，在此「只重衣衫不重人」的世界，原有這樣情形，</p>
<p>昨據香港電，鄧澤如向政委會提議，禁穿洋貨服裝，以窒碍難行，未獲通過，但省府昨已通令，凡公務人員，一律須穿土布長衫，在此生活程度日高，驕奢淫逸之風日熾的時候，提倡節儉，戀愛不忘救國</p>
<p>從軍不忘救國</p>
<p>娱樂不忘救國</p>
<p>讀書不忘救國</p>
<p>運動不忘救國</p>
<p>原是當局者應有的責任，而政委會以窒碍難行，未予通過，正是令人不解，</p>
<p>凡屬公務人員，他們吃飯要緊，假定頒布此令，雷厲風行，斷不會有不肯穿土布長衫，而自願辭職之理，窒碍何在，令人可疑，惟思窒碍者，諸政委會員，大抵係有産階級及有相當地位之人，若使公務人員穿土布長衫，而自已不穿土布長衫，有些不好意思，若亦穿土布長衫，則似乎有失身分，不足以表示委員的威風，窒碍之處，大約在此，</p>
<p>其實是不要緊的，馮玉祥先生，他所穿的是老布短衣，還没有廣東布長衫的漂亮雅觀，但是他到處照樣受人家的歡迎，並不因他穿了一件老布短襖，被人當作　三先生窮措大一樣看待，可知人的身分，人的人格，决不因其衣服的漂亮與不漂亮，而有所分别，</p>
<p>反之，假定你是一個没有人格的人，即使人身上穿得十分講究，二十分道地，但是傍人决不認你爲有人格，有身分，因爲有這樣的差誤觀念·所以住居都市裏的人們，往往賺了二十元的薪水，十九元八角倒穿在身上，豈不可憐可笑，</p>
<p>我國生産如此的落後，人民生活能力，如此其薄弱，而當局者，還不肯提倡節儉，以作表率，眞是是何居心呢，即以上海言，女界穿着最漂亮的，莫過於妓女，試問妓女之人格如何，身分如何，</p>

<p>— 芮·禺·成</p>
<p>有一個蘇格蘭人班耳Bell在一七八三年首先發明了這種銅滾機器印花。過了二年，就把這事業施行於工廠中：由歷年機器的改進，科學的精進，逐步的去除出新，以致有今日的成績。雖然談不到已經登峯造極，但也可稱完美了。　　現代最新式的印花機是怎樣呢?我來簡單的把牠的構造說明如下：</p>
<p>大概是一隻中空的銅滾，上面有彫刻好了的圖案，套在鐵軸外面：銅滾上面，靠着一大鐵滾：下面靠着毛刷子，毛刷子下面托着一隻顏料盤，盤中盛着顏料：毛刷子底下一部分，就浸在顏料中：一把鋒利的刀片，斜倚在銅滾的中央，銅滾轉旋着，顏料吃在銅滾上面，經刀片刮過之後，銅滾平面的顏料，完全被刮下來：彫刻過的部分，是凹進的，碰不着刮刀，因此只有彫刻的部分裏面留着顏料：大鐵滾外面，將羊毛氈一重一重的包圍着下面緊壓着的銅滾，就得着伸縮的彈力：羊毛氈外面，再罩上一層羊毛襯氈或橡皮布，這樣可使彈力性格外增加：羊毛襯氈外面，罩上棉襯布，來保護羊毛襯氈，使得不被銅滾上的顏料碰着而弄髒：棉襯布的外面，就是安放所需印花的織品。機器開的時候，銅滾上的顏料，經刀片刮過後，留遺在彫刻過的凹處，壓上大鐵滾外邊所需印花的織品上面：靠了中間羊毛氈的彈力性：把所刻的圖案，在織品上印出同樣的花紋來了。</p>
<p>全部印花機，用馬達或水汀引動：大齒輪盤轉動時，上面鐵軸右端鑲着的小齒輪盤也隨之而動，同時鐵軸左端的齒輪盤，轉動着下面毛刷子的齒輪盤，盤中盛着的顏料，跟着毛刷子的轉動，翻上來黏在銅滾的上面，上面的大鐵軸，因受下面銅滾的壓力，也隨着轉動起來。這般源源不息的互相轉動着，就印出了各種圖案花樣的織品。眞是科學萬能啊!</p>

<h3 id="c174">戀愛痛苦與神經關係 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 一·個·讀·者</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>因爲人心的不同各如其面，所以戀愛的眞相是言人人殊。據一般有經騐的人們說：眞正戀愛的結晶品乃由於靈和肉的集合而成。戀愛的象徵，若用解剖的方法，可以分作兩段：</p>
<p>一有形的戀愛　人是屬靈性的動物，未免有了感情：旣然天賦人一種感情，所以遇着適合的異性，那麽，就很容易發生戀愛。男女間的喜悅，兩顆心的跳躍，形成依依不捨的樣子。久而久之，「頭痛」「發燒」「吐嘔」「渴睡」「抽筋」等等狀態都跟着戀愛的過程而千變萬化起來了。因爲這種病態可以診斷的，所以呌做有形的變愛（Love　Visible）</p>
<p>二無形的戀愛　換言之·戀愛實在是一種精神病。或者可以說神經受了作用而産生的結果。除了靈的傾向，還有肉的要求。因爲神經是腦部（指靈）和性部（指肉）的總樞紐有連帶密切的關係。靈魂不絶地思想，肉體不停的燒烯，愛的火由頭燒到眼，由眼而燒到全身。所以有人說愛與死是同樣的偉大丨假如没有自制的能力·失戀愛悲劇，男的便要發狂，女的便要發痴，甚至迫切而趨於自殺的途徑。神經失常神經反常神經異常是人世間多麽悲苦的事情啊！因爲思想不能集中，心病無藥醫治，所以呌做無形的變愛（Love　Invisible）</p>
<p>戀愛的痛苦和神經影響旣如上述，由此更可以推廣戀愛的魔力關係及於社會。愛的感化，可以使一個殺人放火的强盜改善而爲賢人君子：反過來講：愛的損傷，可以令一個賢人君子激怒做出殺人流血的勾當。因此這個新名詞丨戀愛丨不光是含有社會性，而且含有改造性，在現代已經成爲極嚴重的問題。歷史内，電影裏，小說中，不知道表演過多少回。最近如陶思瑾女士和黎妹妹的情殺案件就是一個例子。固然戀愛是不容第三者的揷口。他們有他們的内幕，我作者是没有權限可以干涉：但我本身是社會的一份子，不得不想些辦法來改良一下：怎樣增進人羣的幸福而减少戀愛的痛苦呢？</p>
<p>我的辦法以爲一最好努力奮鬥使有情人成爲眷屬：二信仰宗敎，使靈魂安定而不至於墮落：三用義克服慾：用理智制止感情：天下多好男子和美婦人，儘管可以另尋佳偶四思想要高超，眼光要遠大：戀愛雖然不成功還可以做别樣有益於世的工作。犧牲小我而成大我纔不愧爲一個英雄或烈女。末了讓作者抄襲法國大將福煦的訓話來勸勉一般摩登青年們：</p>
<p>「男的應該多做些工作：女的應該多做些祈禱。」安分守已，完成人格。學堂寫眞</p>

<p>流·影·</p>
<p>這天下午一至二的地理敎員請假。但揭示貼得遲了，學生們已在敎室裏等了。S君和D君立在敎室門口伸長了項頸等候去探聽消息的那個同學的回音。一會兒這個探子跳也似的帶了個喜信跑回來說請假條已貼出了。這一來全敎室像開了瓶蓋的汽水汎起的汽泡一般，歡呼聲拍手聲笑聲凳脚擊地聲一齊爆發了。接着三三五五的學生都挾了書談笑着走出敎室去了。</p>
<p>「吃冰淇淋去哇！」S君從後喚着打頭走出敎室門的D君說。D君應了一聲好，把本來右轉灣預備到宿舍去的脚尖轉了個一百八十度角跟S君去了。</p>
<p>愛靜不愛動的蜜司C，因爲次一個鐘頭也是在這個敎室上課，一則省得跑來跑去，二則看到别的同學綂綂去了，只剩下她一個人，正好靜靜的看書。她依舊坐着，翻開一本小說來看。</p>
<p>天氣很熱，敎室傍的空地上·本來常有幾個男學生在蹴小皮球的，現在也被灼熱的太陽趕走了。四圍的空氣，異常沉寂，敎室内只可聽到約每隔幾分鐘蜜司C翻書頁的聲音。但過了半個鐘頭，這書頁聲也斷絶了。蜜司C靠在桌上睡着了。</p>
<p>S君和D君從校門口一爿凉食店裏回來了。剛走到一扇臨走廊的敎室的窗門口，S君把D君的手臂一扯，二人如乎同時站住了脚。D君向S君看了一眼，又依S君尖着的嘴所指示的地點看去。</p>
<p>「蜜司C丨」D君似驚似喜。</p>
<p>「女同學的睡容！這倒難得看見的呢！」</p>
<p>「進去飽飽眼福吧！」</p>
<p>「贊成！」</p>
<p>二人進了敎室靜悄悄走近蜜司C去了。</p>
<p>D君把蜜司C的嘴凝視了好久。蜜司C的嘴唇神經的顫動了一下。D君帶着羡慕的口吻說道，「將來不知是給誰的幸福啊！」</p>
<p>「要Kiss不是很容易麽，現在正是一個機會，横豎她不會察覺的。」</p>
<p>「嚇，你若敢和她接一個吻，我請你吃十杯冰淇淋。」「眞的麽，」量你不敢。「十杯冰淇淋要算數的呢！」「算數。」</p>
<p>Ｓ君下了决心輕輕走近蜜司Ｃ身前，屈下身很小心的悄悄地在蜜司Ｃ嘴唇上吻了一吻，可是Ｓ君尚未抬起頭來，蜜司Ｃ已醒覺了，她像是反射運動似的迅速地用手帕將嘴巴揩了一揩，怒目責問Ｓ君「作甚」</p>
<p>「你的嘴唇上停着一個蒼蠅？我：：：」Ｓ君自已也覺得這話太答得發鬆，不覺失聲笑了出來，Ｄ君也忍不住大笑了。</p>
<p>被他們這一笑蜜司Ｃ更覺得Ｓ君是有意侮辱她了，她撲在桌子上大聲哭起來了。</p>
<p>Ｓ君和Ｄ君面面相覷，大家伸了伸舌頭。</p>
<p>這時正打了退課鐘，同學們一五一十地趕來看把戲，Ｓ君怕事態擴大，向撲着的蜜司Ｃ連聲說對不起，但蜜司Ｃ理也不理他，站起來一手掩着面哭出敎室去了，同學們接二連三的問Ｓ君與Ｄ君爲什麽事，但他兩人的答覆總是一句「没有什麽。」</p>
<p>事態終於擴大了，蜜司Ｃ課也不上，撲在寢室裏的牀上哭，晚飯也不肯吃，同房間的女同學去報告了舍監，舍監到女生宿舍來問，但蜜司Ｃ始終一句話也不回答。</p>
<p>全校的男同學都互相談論，揣摩這事件的原因，後來竟閙起這樣一個謠言來，說Ｓ君與Ｄ君在某號敎室對蜜司Ｃ施了暴行，致使蜜司Ｃ有啞子吃黄連說不出的苦。</p>
<p>Ｓ君見同學的推測勝過他的犯罪行爲，怕被學校當局聽見了於他更不利，他只得奮勇地到敎務處去自首了。當然添加了許多辯護自已的話，但到底把接吻的事實老老實實招了出來。</p>
<p>敎務長對於自首的一層看得非常清高，所以主張以輕刑處罰Ｓ君，但因爲級主任反對，結果折衷地貼了這樣一張簡短的條子了事。</p>
<p>Ｓ君侮辱女同學着記大過一次敎務處</p>
<p>後來有一個男同學在壁報上批評道：</p>
<p>「女同學的接吻的代價，只是一個大過，還有十杯冰淇淋可吃！值得值得。」</p>
<p>血性</p>

<p>曼·倩·</p>
<p>親愛的Ｇ妹：</p>
<p>Ｇ妹　我們的軍隊在今天的正午已開到了離Ｃ城不過三四十里的山谷中·來日朦朧時預備襲城了，光復我沉淪在鐵蹄下將近一年的Ｃ城，現在弟兄們有的也正在寫信，有的在摩拳擦掌，準備來日的惡戰，我是假着這個機會提起筆來和月餘不見的你談談，想你也一定望眼欲穿的了！</p>
<p>想到往事，眞會使我十二分的難過，但是，人生離别是總免不掉的，何况我這次是爲了愛護我的祖國，對付我的仇敵呢，Ｇ！還記得吧，我離家的前一天，在平日我總在放學後下午四點鐘的光景回家的，到了家裏也祗是有說有笑，但總不曾像這天遲至夜半十一點鐘才回家，這一層已足足使你和我那慈愛的雙親驚異。</p>
<p>再一看到我一副充滿了熱血飛紅的臉蛋，加上了一種因將離别而慘然的狀態，當你們又聽了我說「兒子已投入了義勇軍：：」這簡直是都被呆定了，你的眼我看是紅了，一瞬間已掩着面跑上樓去。</p>
<p>這時候祗賸了父親母親同我三人，最後還是父親把靜寂的空氣打破了說：　　「華兒！你得自已明瞭，軍隊裏的生活我們過不慣的啊，的確，愛國，救國，誰都有着這個責任，但是不一定救國工作就是拿起槍桿子去對付敵人啊！後方需要着我們多着呢，華兒！聽了爲父的話吧，我懇求你：：」</p>
<p>父親是上了年紀的人，不能連續着多說，剛說了幾句已是喘不過氣來了，呵！我眞感激父親，深深明瞭他一番的好意，憐愛他兒子的身體孱弱，熬不住軍營中的生活，同時母親也是哭聲的說：</p>
<p>「華兒！養育到你這般大也是不容易的，一旦别了你年老多病的父母和温存體貼的愛妻，於心何忍？你想吧，父親年老是不中用了，我呢又是這樣的老不死，三日兩頭的睡到在床上，你妻子也已經有了三個月的孕，你現在一旦捨了我們到那殺人不見血的戰塲上去，萬一的出了亂子，呌我們靠誰去？：：華兒！</p>
<p>母親是悲慘的話不成聲了，我再也忍不住哭聲響應了一堂，同時我也曾聽到樓上也似乎有一種極細微的泣聲傳佈出來，這時我内心在交戰着的，「去」？「不去」？但是最後我總深信着要找我們國家的出路唯有武力的抵抗，到前線殺敵犧牲去，所以仍是堅持着已見，毅然的回了個「不」字。</p>
<p>時候已是一點鐘敲過了好久，父親覺得再没挽回的餘地，最後說：「夜深了上樓睡去吧，我們的話是好意？惡意？你再仔細的思量一下去。」</p>
<p>我也不回答躑躅的走到房裏，看見你還没有睡，兩眼是紅腫得和胡桃一般，我眞想不出拿什麽話來安慰你才好，祗自在整理着一切應用的東西，預備清晨好準時開拔，你見我這種忙亂的形狀，想是越發的驚奇吧？否則你怎會問我：「這做什麽？難道明天就要離我們去了麽？」啊！你嗚嗚的哭了，我這時候不知怎樣才好，惟有把你緊緊的擁抱着，蜜蜜的吻着，好容易你停止了哭聲，如怨如艾的問着我所以抛家遠去的緣故，我當時就對你講着，東鄰的壓迫，國家的垂亡，做國民的責任，我的所以離家遠去是爲國家找出路，替民族求生存，誰知你倒也是個一腔熱血的女子，聽了我的話，居然一變剛才婆婆媽媽的態度，並且用話激勵着我，帮同我整理行裝。</p>
<p>Ｇ！這時我内心是何等的愉快呵，禁不住的又接了個酣蜜的長吻。</p>
<p>Ｇ妹：現在累你了，要照顧家事，要服侍年老的父母，並且還是個有了身孕的人，呵！現在没别的好酬謝你，這信的一邊一角都是經我蜜蜜吻過的，現在送給你，請你細細地體味着吧！同時我更希望在明天多殺幾個敵人來慰我的知已，再會了，親愛的妹妹，你愛的華于惡戰的前一天。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the Japanese Government's Recognition of the Puppet Regime <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Originally:</p>
<p>From the beginning of its preparations, Japan's approach to recognizing the puppet regime has been a rapid downward spiral, exhibiting great impatience. However, as it approaches the critical juncture of formal recognition, it has suddenly adopted an attitude of cautious consideration. After preliminary deliberation, the Privy Council consulted the Emperor and then specially appointed nine examiners for a second review. Japan is taking this so seriously today. Does it, after its resolute advance, still harbor some concerns? Is this a case of "approaching a task with fear"? Regarding such a significant and complex issue, we believed that the Japanese government would proceed unilaterally and without looking back, but that seems unlikely. However, based on observed facts, Japan's determination to recognize the puppet regime has clearly been long-standing. Even the points it considers worthy of concern have been deeply pondered and carefully arranged beforehand. Therefore, today's cautious consideration by the Privy Council is merely a further thorough deliberation, and not a change to the established facts. This can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>Since Japan single-handedly created the puppet regime of Manchuria, its plan to annex the region makes recognition an inevitable step. However, it is also aware that recognition will be opposed by the world. Therefore, it has on the one hand tried its best to conceal the truth about the puppet regime through propaganda, and on the other hand used various means to probe the intentions of the United States, the League of Nations, and other major powers. The dispatch of Special Envoy Mutō, Foreign Minister Uchida's speech in the Diet, and the recent propaganda about the cabinet's decision to recognize the regime immediately are all expressions of this probing. However, the United States and other major powers have remained silent, not revealing their positions. The Japanese then believe that the silence of the United States and other major powers implies acquiescence. Looking at recent Japanese newspapers, many carry optimistic remarks about the major powers retreating in the face of difficulties. This shows that Japan is either confident in its efforts or has already deeply understood the inner workings of the international community. If it does not quickly recognize the regime around this 9/18 anniversary, when else will it wait? This is what reality is telling us.</p>
<p>However, regardless of how the United States and other powers will respond to Japan's recognition of the puppet regime, we will not ask for the moment. How much of a major impact will Japan's destruction of the League of Nations charter, disregard for the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and all international public law have on the world? This is something that all countries of the world will jointly bear. If countries around the world truly value this impact and believe that it is enough to hinder peace, they will naturally urgently devise effective joint sanctions. This is not a matter for one country alone. For our country, the relationship is unlike that of other countries. We must unanimously vow to deny the puppet regime that the Japanese will recognize. Who does not know that the creation of the Manchurian puppet regime was entirely orchestrated by the Japanese and cannot be attributed to the self-determination of the Manchurian people or the separatist movement of local leaders? The so-called new country of the puppet regime has not even fully prepared its new country's form. Recently, righteous armies have sprung up everywhere, and the puppet regime is on the verge of collapse. In this situation, where are the elements for the establishment of a new country? How can it be said that it does not violate the conditions for recognition? After the puppet regime is announced, although our country has not launched a campaign against it, it is still a part of Chinese territory. The three northeastern provinces have not yet broken away from their motherland. To recognize it in this state, is this not destroying the integrity of our territory? In international practice, the so-called recognition of a new country means recognizing it as a new member of the international community. Only when all countries can recognize it does it become a country. If only one country blatantly recognizes it, what benefit is there for the puppet regime? So where does Japan's reason for recognition lie? Its excuse is to build a paradise of safety for both Chinese and foreigners, and to guarantee the peaceful resolution of de facto disputes. These are all façade words for other countries, and the real reason is nothing more than the phrase that Manchuria is Japan's lifeline. However, does Japan believe that Manchuria is not our country's lifeline? Japan plans to destroy other people's lives to protect its own. Does it think that our people will willingly abandon their own lives to solidify Japan's life? If our people truly understand the danger to their own lives, then today we must unite and resist Japan's recognition of the puppet regime. According to a Tokyo dispatch, Ambassador Chiang visited Araki and Uchida to exchange views regarding the Japanese government's impending recognition of the Manchurian puppet regime. Araki said that the only way for China to improve the situation in the future is for the Chinese to forget the past events in the three northeastern provinces and Shanghai, and adopt a more friendly policy. Uchida also said that Sino-Japanese amity should be considered separately from the Manchurian issue. The Manchurian issue is a separate development in the Manchurian Incident, and both China and Japan should discuss it from a new footing. It can be seen that the two ministers of the army and foreign affairs have long since put the Manchurian issue aside, and the Minister of the Army even hopes that our people will also put the Manchurian issue aside and forget it. Alas, even if our people have no conscience, can they forget the pain of this tragic and immense change? Unless Japan fundamentally changes its established policy, no matter how good the Japanese government's policy is, and no matter how accommodating the Chinese government's good intentions are, it will be impossible for our people to forget this tragic and immense change, not only today but perhaps forever. If Japan recognizes the regime on this 9/18 anniversary, then today, the first commemoration of the 9/18 Incident, will add an even more tragic commemoration. Can it be said that our people can forget it? Will our people only not forget this?</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Declares to Britain, the United States, and France That Japan is Seizing Our Country's Salt Tax</p>
<h3 id="e13">Salt Tax-Guaranteed Debts Difficult to Repay on Schedule <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a note to the governments of Britain, the United States, and France on the 11th, stating that after Japan occupied the Northeast by force, it destroyed the unified salt administration of our country and seized tax revenues. According to statistics from our Ministry of Finance, the salt tax in various parts of the Northeast, from April 1 to the end of August, seized by the Japanese amounted to more than 1,089,000 yuan, excluding the additional tax of three jiao per dan. The above income was used by our government to guarantee the British-French loan of 1907, the Hukwang loan of 1910, and the post-settlement loan of 1912, and has never been delayed. Its credit is well-known. However, since the Japanese occupied the Northeast and destroyed the salt administration, our country's tax revenue has been reduced and the losses have been huge. Therefore, although the principal and interest of the debts due this year are due in September, our country is afraid that it will be difficult to repay them on schedule due to the above-mentioned impact. Therefore, the governments and people of various countries should pay serious attention to the Japanese destruction of international interests and the impact on China's tax revenue guaranteeing foreign debts.

<p>Two Derailments of Chinese Eastern Railway Passenger Trains</p>
<h3 id="e14">Over 100 Killed and Injured in Train Derailment Near Xitun <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Changchun) News of a train accident 40 miles south of Harbin was received this morning. It is reported that more than 100 people were killed or injured. The train was a regular passenger train from Changchun to Harbin and departed at 5:45 p.m. Due to bandits tearing up the tracks at a location 40 miles south of Harbin, when the train arrived at that location, the locomotive and several passenger cars derailed and overturned. The bandits then rose up to rob and abducted several people, presumably to detain them for ransom. A relief train has now been dispatched to the scene of the accident. It is reported that the scale of this disaster is unprecedented in the history of the Chinese Eastern Railway. There were several foreigners on the train, but it has not yet been ascertained. However, it is known that the son of Vilat, the owner and reporter of the New York National News, was also on the train, and his safety is unknown. The telegrams received here are very brief, only mentioning that the local situation is extremely terrible. After the train overturned, there were screams of agony, some passengers calling for help, and others crying out in pain under the train. The bandits turned a deaf ear, searching the pockets and luggage of those lying on the ground, taking all valuables, boarding the train to plunder, and then abducting several passengers and disappearing with a roar. Harbin has recently been isolated from other places due to major flooding, and now it has suffered this strange disaster, and trains on the east, west, and south sides cannot pass through. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th) (Harbin) At 9:45 p.m. last night, the No. 11 passenger train from Harbin to Changchun derailed near Xitun Station, 62 kilometers south of Harbin, because the tracks were destroyed by the Righteous Army. 11 passengers were killed and 31 were injured. Because the incident occurred late at night, it was chaotic. After receiving this urgent message, Harbin immediately dispatched an ambulance. During the chaos, a Japanese reserve officer among the passengers was kidnapped and his whereabouts are unknown. (Dentsu dispatch on the 11th)</p>

It will have to wait until the Executive Yuan meets in October to discuss it, at which time Lord Lytton himself will also attend. A copy of the report to the United States will be taken by an official of the League of Nations Investigating Team, who is passing through the capital today. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>Regarding the Recognition of the Puppet Regime</p>
<p>Urges Careful Consideration</p>
<p>Uchida's Reply Lacks Sincerity</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch on the 11th: Envoy Jiang Zuobin, under instruction from the National Government, visited Foreign Minister Uchida yesterday at 4:30 PM to verbally raise concerns. The general idea was that he had heard that Japan was about to recognize "Manchukuo." This attitude of Japan would hinder Sino-Japanese relations and could lead to serious consequences. He requested careful consideration. He continued, saying that the responsibility for any situation arising from the Sino-Japanese conflict caused by Japan's recognition of Manchukuo would fall entirely on Japan. Foreign Minister Uchida replied that the recognition of "Manchukuo" was an established policy of the Japanese government and absolutely could not be changed. The friendship between China and Japan should be considered separately from the Manchukuo issue, because the Manchukuo issue was a separate development in the whirlpool of the Manchurian Incident. Both China and Japan should address this issue from a new starting point. However, it would not be in the interests of either side if this issue hindered their friendship. Maintaining friendly relations between China and Japan has always been Japan's hope. Disputes with neighboring countries are something that the Japanese government desperately wants to avoid. If China understands the meaning of the Manchukuo issue in the Far East and recognizes the necessity of coordination between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, it can naturally promote friendship between China and Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Lytton Report Investigation <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Content Seems Favorable to Japan</p>
<p>China Possesses the Empty Name of Sovereignty Over the Northeast</p>
<p>| Observations of the British Observer |</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: The Observer commented on the events of the week today, stating that there has been much speculation inside and outside the country regarding the Lytton Report in recent days, causing quite a stir. Its active nature is quite unique. The full text of the report is closely guarded, so that plagiarists and the curious alike have no way to apply their skills. The rumors from both the Chinese and Japanese sides are certainly suspect. However, we firmly believe that Lord Lytton and his colleagues have completed a difficult task with skillful talent. Those enthusiasts who have gone astray hoping that the report will severely lash out at Japan will now be disappointed by its all-round thoroughness. We are confident that the recommendations in the Lytton Report are equivalent to preventing Japan from leaving the League of Nations. The report will certainly be a masterpiece of diplomacy. The newspaper also said that, in terms of realistic ideas, the problem has now been reduced to three key points: 1. Protecting Japan's economic rights; 2. China's political rights; and 3. Integrating all relevant parties. The second point is the most difficult, because on the plaintiff's side, political rights must first have a political entity. Therefore, a smart diplomat will certainly intend to give the substance to Japan and the shadow to China. (What China possesses is only a great political shadow.) He will convene a meeting of China, Japan, and other relevant powers to seek a compromise on the entire issue. The newspaper concluded that this is, in fact, the overall purpose of the Lytton Report as we know it.</p>

<p>Neutral Countries Demand Immediate Ceasefire</p>
<p>League of Nations Warns of Respect for Treaty Obligations</p>
<p>National Press, Paraguayan Capital, 10th: The Paraguayan government announced today that Paraguayan troops have recaptured the Boquerón Fort. This fort was originally a Paraguayan stronghold and was occupied by Bolivian troops a few days ago.</p>
<p>Havas, Paraguayan Capital, 10th: Demonstrators marched through the city and then visited the President. The President declared, "Paraguay is like fragile glass. Those who dare to strike it will inevitably be cut and injured by the glass. I hope that everyone will cooperate with the military."</p>
<p>National Press, Washington, 10th: The neutral committee considering the Bolivian-Paraguayan boundary dispute today sent notes to both Paraguay and Bolivia, demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities and submitting the dispute to arbitration.</p>
<p>National Press, Geneva, 11th: The Acting Chairman of the League of Nations Executive Council, Madariaga, today sent a telegram to the governments of Bolivia and Paraguay, asking them to report to the League of Nations in the shortest possible time on the plans they have discussed to end the situation that could harm peace. He also urged them to pay close attention to their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations Charter. However, the telegram did not mention the possibility of the League of Nations implementing sanctions. Madariaga issued this because there was news that a state of war had been presented between Bolivia and Paraguay. After the Paraguayan army repelled the Bolivian troops attacking Valencia and Bocha Town, they are now conducting an offensive. The two sides used heavy artillery and aircraft to fight fiercely for 24 hours, inflicting heavy casualties on each other. The Paraguayan army has captured the Boquerón and Samaklay forts.</p>
<h3 id="e53">French Reply to German Note <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Content Contains Six Points</p>
<p>The Wording Is Extremely Strong</p>
<p>Explicitly Rejects the Demand for Military Equality</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Publishes an Article in Support of Germany</p>
<p>National Press, Paris, 10th: France's reply to Germany's request for military equality was fully approved today after a long discussion at a special cabinet meeting chaired by the President. The reply may be sent out by special envoy today and delivered to German Foreign Minister Neurath by French Ambassador to Germany Ponsot tomorrow. Although the content of the reply cannot be announced until Monday evening at the earliest, many French newspapers claim to have learned what the content is. It is said that in addition to absolutely rejecting the principle of military equality, there are other matters. It is also heard that the reasons held by the French side are roughly divided into six points. First, the French side, based on Article 164 of the Treaty of Versailles, rejects Germany's proposal to publicly exchange opinions and states that this issue should first be brought before the League of Nations Council. Second, France does not recognize Germany's interpretation of the military provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. Third, France claims that its military has already been automatically reduced and is still continuing to be reduced. Fourth, France does not allow Germany to increase its military, as this would conflict with the Treaty of Versailles and violate the spirit of disarmament. It is said that the wording of France on this point is extremely strong. Fifth, France advises Germany to respect the dignity of treaties. Sixth, France protests against the use of hostile language in the public speeches of German cabinet members. It is also reported by the French newspapers that the document also states that this is the opinion of France alone. The French newspapers are very dissatisfied with this, fearing that Britain will decide not to intervene in the Franco-German dispute, and Germany will be even more excited to pursue its military equality policy.</p>
<p>Havas, Warsaw, 10th: Foreign Minister Zaleski has recently received French Ambassador Laroche. The reason for Laroche's visit to the Polish Foreign Minister is probably to hand over the draft of France's reply to Germany's memorandum to the Polish government.</p>
<p>Havas, Capital of Yugoslavia, 10th: The Yugoslav government has received the draft of the French government's reply to the memorandum submitted by Germany from the French government.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 10th: The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung published an article by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, entitled "Germany Is Right." The article supports Germany, saying that its demand for military equality is the most important event in the current international political situation. Mussolini also praised General Schleicher, saying that he is "resolute and capable, truly the strongest figure in the current German cabinet."</p>
<h3 id="e54">German Parliament to Convene Again Today <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Papen Will Deliver an Important Speech</p>
<p>Schleicher Supports the Presidential Cabinet System</p>
<p>The Attempts of the Central Party and the Nazi Party Fall Flat</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 11th: The National Socialist Party and the Central Party previously had an agreement to cease political warfare for four years. It is now known that the two sides have not yet reached an understanding on a common economic and political program that can form a parliamentary majority. After Parliament reopens tomorrow, President Hindenburg will allow representatives from both parties to have a second audience. Judging from the existing agreement between the National Socialist Party and the Central Party, it seems to be only opposing the Papen cabinet. Germany now seems to be about to hold another general election. Various political parties are now predicting the future strength of each party, and at the same time, officials are also rushing to prepare Papen's speech to be delivered in Parliament. It is expected that it can be finalized today. Prime Minister Papen must also prepare a reply to the speech on the issue of disarmament delivered by the French Prime Minister today. It is expected that Papen will explain the government's economic procedures tomorrow, as well as its impact on the labor sector and foreign trade relations.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 11th: Schleicher is now one of the most powerful people in German domestic politics. Every word and action of his is of great importance. Tonight, Schleicher officially announced that he would never participate in a "presidential" cabinet jointly formed by the Central Party and the National Socialist Party with the support of a majority in the House of Representatives. With this statement, all the attempts of the Central Party and the National Socialist Party fell flat. Schleicher explained the reason for his refusal, saying, "What is currently advocated is a presidential cabinet. The spirit of this type of cabinet lies in being unaffected by political parties. Now, a cabinet that is actually controlled by political parties is given the name of a presidential cabinet. This is not something that I can assist. Any action that diminishes the status of the current cabinet is disloyal to the President. I cannot do it." Judging from Schleicher's statement, it can be seen that the Papen cabinet has indeed gained the President's complete trust. Currently, the key to all government combinations in Germany lies in Schleicher. Now that Schleicher's attitude has been made clear, the President's move to meet with the parliamentary leaders of the Central Party and the National Socialist Party before the Prime Minister next Tuesday is of little importance. It is expected that the Central Party and the National Socialist Party will refuse to accept the current cabinet. If this is true, then the Prime Minister has a dissolution order signed by the President, and the House of Representatives will be dissolved on Wednesday or Thursday.</p>

However, there are fears that Germany may eventually not attend the Disarmament Conference, leading to the breakdown of the conference, or even withdrawing from the League of Nations again. The French side claims that limiting the disarmament budget will greatly strike at Germany's secret military and pocket battleships.</p>

Abide by the spirit of national construction in order to rebuild international justice; 2. Establish a unified economic system in order to guarantee the lives of the masses; 3. Break the accumulated malpractices of the political world in order to thoroughly implement national politics.</p>

<p>Requesting Uchida to Explain Doubts</p>
<p>National Press, Washington, 10th: The US Embassy in Japan reported to the State Department today that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently investigating the claim in the Japanese newspaper that Citibank's Osaka branch engaged in espionage photography. The embassy said that such records are enough to harm the dignity of the bank. Now, the US State Department welcomes Foreign Minister Uchida to reiterate that the bank's photographs are not of military importance, hoping to dispel the doubts of the Japanese people. It is regrettable that there has been a tendency to generate doubts between the two countries over many trivial matters in recent times. Also, Citibank's headquarters in New York explained that the Osaka branch's move was only intended to enable the bank to obtain the latest situation of the location of its branch, in order to observe the progress of other countries. Moreover, such photographs have long been published in magazines and Japanese newspapers, and there is no reason for the Japanese to oppose them.</p>

<h3 id="e61">National Army Recovers Xinji <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Right-Wing Army Encircles and Attacks the Jinjiazhai Bandit Nest, Which Can Be Taken Down Sooner or Later</p>
<p>Chiang Authorizes Xu Yuanquan to Handle Post-War Affairs in Central Hubei with Full Authority</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xinji is located on the border between Henan and Hubei, forming a three-legged strategic position with Huang'an Qiliping and Jinjiazhai in western Anhui, becoming an important nest for the Red bandits. This time, the central route army of the National Army launched an attack from both Henan and Hubei, adopting a large encirclement strategy, attacking from the north and south. First, they destroyed the key passes along the way, and then concentrated their forces to attack Xinji. At that time, the suppression of bandits in Anhui was successful, and the bandit troops were unable to take care of themselves, so reinforcements were cut off. However, the bandits relied on solid fortifications as a last resort, and knowing that their survival was at stake, they still tried their best to hold out against the National Army as a desperate measure. On the National Army's side, in addition to the troops of Liu Zhi, Zhang Fang, etc., advancing step by step from north to south and strictly preventing them from fleeing north, the troops of Wei Lihuang, advancing from the north and south, launched a fierce attack, facing the bandits head-on. From the 7th, they fought the bandits in a bloody battle for two days and nights. On the 9th, the bandit forces were unable to hold on and retreated completely. At 8 a.m. on that day, the Xinji bandit nest was completely recovered by Wei's army. All the pseudo-headquarters, arsenals, and military hospitals were destroyed. A large number of bandits were captured and killed, and a large number of guns were seized. Two "Marx" and "Lenin" aircraft were also captured. The remnants of the bandits fled eastward in a state of extreme distress. The aircraft reconnaissance report and Wei Junzhang's victory telegram have arrived in Wuhan today (10th). What they described is the same. With the Red bandits losing their stronghold, they can be wiped out in a matter of days. At the same time, the 5th Column of the Central Route Army began to attack Yingshan. On the 9th and 10th, they completely occupied the key passes near Yingshan County, one after another. The area is already under multiple encirclements and can be taken down soon. The 1st and 2nd Columns of the Right Route Army, taking advantage of the victory, pursued from Mabou. According to a telegram on the 10th, they have been pressing close to the Jinjiazhai bandit nest. All the fortifications built by the Red bandits have been destroyed by air force bombs and army artillery fire. Even if the bandits want to hold on to their defenses, they will not be able to. The recovery of Jinjiazhai is also just around the corner. According to the above, these places are all occupied by the Kwong Jixun's troops of the 4th Front Army of the Red bandits. The losses in the battles of Huoqiu, Huang'an, and Qiliping were enormous. Therefore, the National Army is like pulling up rotten wood and destroying dry weeds wherever it goes. The speed of progress is unprecedented. If Yingshan and Jinjiazhai are captured again, the Red bandits in that area will have no place to stand, and the devastated society of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui can gradually be restored. As for the Left Route Army, its only target is the He Long bandit gang, which has recently been driven into Honghu and heavily blockaded. Within the entire lake, only two mounds are still in the hands of the bandits. The rest have been occupied by Xu Yuanquan, Zhang Zhenhan, and other troops. Both the north and south banks of the Xiang River have long been cleared. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, considering that the bandit areas in that route have been largely recovered, and in order to facilitate the handling of post-war affairs, specially ordered Xu Yuanquan to handle everything with full authority. All local party and government officials and personnel responsible for clearing the countryside in the central Hubei area are under his immediate command, guidance, and supervision, so as to achieve the effect of using one's arms and fingers.

<h3 id="e63">Bandit Atmosphere in Lu and Tong Counties of Anhui Province Gradually Subsides <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Tang Yunshan's Brigade Ordered to Advance and Suppress</p>
<p>Yingshan County Placed Under Hubei Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The bandits in Anhui Province, Zhang Da Bizi and Quan Guangyi's troops, were previously recruited by a certain army. Later, due to lack of supplies, they relapsed into their old ways and looted Jinniu Town in Lujiang County and Kongcheng Town in Tongcheng County, one after another. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, specially telegraphed the Independent 33rd Brigade of Tang Yunshan to temporarily be under the command of the provincial government and ordered Tang's brigade to send troops to suppress the bandits in the Shuhe area. Tang's brigade had just arrived in Anhui from western Anhui after suppressing bandits, so they immediately dispatched two battalions of Ni Rongxian's regiment and the entire Liu's regiment to block and suppress them. The defense of the provincial capital was also taken over by Tang's troops because the 5th Regiment of the Military Police of Zhang Benqing was ordered to go to Nanjing. Later, Tang's brigade received an order from the Military Commission that the training team of the Central Military Academy was about to concentrate on training in Wuhu. The remaining defense of Datong was originally intended to be taken over by Tang's brigade. Now Tang's brigade must take over the defense after the bandit suppression is completed. As for the bandits in Tongcheng, after being pursued and suppressed by Ni's regiment, progress has been quite rapid. However, Yu Yuying, the magistrate of Tongcheng County, was kidnapped while leading troops in hot pursuit. The bandits demanded recruitment as a condition for his release. The provincial government has now temporarily appointed Wang Weixia as a substitute to avoid a situation where no one is in charge. As for Lujiang, the city defense suddenly became strained a few days ago due to the bandits' attempt to attack the city. Tang's brigade ordered the advancing troops to suppress the bandits according to the original plan and telegraphed the neighboring county teams to block and intercept them at key points. Brigade Commander Tang also went to Luting to supervise the battle, hoping to annihilate them as soon as possible. The provincial government received a telegram from the General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui stating that Yingshan County, which belongs to Anhui Province, is adjacent to Luotian Chishui in Hubei Province. The county seat is located upstream of Chishui, which is beyond the reach of the administrative power of Anhui Province. For the convenience of clearing and suppressing bandits and handling post-war affairs, it is temporarily placed under the jurisdiction of the Third Administrative Inspectorate of Hubei Province. This has been submitted to the provincial government's regular meeting on the 9th for compliance. (September 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Jiangsu Province Sets a Deadline for Supplementary Land Prices <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>A three-month deadline from the date of the announcement</p>
<p>Failure to pay by the deadline will result in the confiscation of half of the land</p>
<p>Regarding the case of supplementary land prices for developed land in Jiangsu Province, the Department of Finance previously ordered the financial bureaus of various counties to consult with the county government, consider local conditions, and collect a large sum of money within three months to alleviate urgent needs. However, the reports and remittances from various bureaus have been scarce, and the deadline has now passed. The Department of Finance believes that the need for funds is urgent and cannot be delayed any further. Yesterday, it ordered various counties to continue to follow the previously agreed-upon method of urging payment and to announce it in conjunction with the Sand Land Bureau. The original resolution on urging payment of supplementary land prices for developed land is recorded as follows: "For old cases before May 18th of the Republic of China where land prices have not been paid, in accordance with the order of the ministry, land prices shall be collected regardless of whether the land has been enclosed and developed. Various bureaus shall issue a public notice in conjunction with the county government's land bureau, setting a strict deadline (from the date of the announcement to three months) for implementation. If households fail to pay by the deadline, the assumed disposal methods are as follows: 1. The county government's land bureau shall order the households that have failed to pay the land price to be arrested and detained as a warning; 2. The county government's land bureau shall take away the households' business licenses and issue tax certificates for half of the land. The remaining half shall be taken back by the bureau and put up for sale; 3. The county government's land bureau shall seal off and harvest the half of the land to be taken back. Violators will be severely punished; 4. The half of the land to be disposed of shall be put up for sale by the bureau. If someone claims it, the original claiming household shall be strictly prevented from obstructing. Violators will be severely punished. The original claiming household shall not demand compensation for expenses such as enclosure fees for the land from the claiming household in order to avoid disputes. The above methods shall be implemented separately by various bureaus after considering local conditions."</p>

<h3 id="e65">Inspection of Oil and Coal Mines <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 28th, the team leader Hu Chuanyuan and team members Ma Jinhong, Jing Lan, Hu Jue-wen, Gu Zhizhong, Zhu Rui-jie, Zhu Qiqing, Shen Yiqian, and others, a total of ten people, rode horses, mules, and donkeys, crossed the gurgling Luo River, and arrived at Qiao'ergou to inspect the oil mine, and at Liuwanjiagou to inspect the coal mine. Qiao'ergou is located seven li east of the county seat. We rode our horses quickly and arrived at the town in less than an hour. The so-called oil mine is located near the Catholic Church established by Spanish missionaries in the area. The mine was jointly exploited by China and the United States in February of the third year of the Republic of China. The well is about thirty zhang deep and produces about thirty catties of oil per day. Because the quantity was too small, further work was ordered to dig deeper in the hope of obtaining a large amount of oil. Unexpectedly, the result of digging deeper was only sand. The mine was unable to sustain itself and was shut down in September of that year. What we saw at that time was that the wellhead of the mine was completely covered by yellow soil, and the ground was covered with vegetables, with no trace of an oil mine. According to the locals, there was nothing to be seen when it rained, but oil appeared in times of drought, which shows that there is still a considerable amount of oil underground.</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM, Hu Boyuan, Ma Jinhong, Jing Lan, Zhu Ruijie, and I, a total of five people, continued to proceed to Liuwanjiagou. The remaining people returned to their residences in the city. Ten minutes later, it rained heavily. We rested in a small village and had some food. At 12:00, it seemed that the sky had cleared after the rain, so we continued to proceed to our destination. After a hundred or so steps, dark clouds suddenly gathered and the rain started again. We did not care and proceeded even faster. We arrived at Liuwanjiagou in a short time. The ditch is about fifteen li from the city. There are currently two operating coal mines, one of which has been abandoned and cannot be used. The other was working when we arrived. The well is in a mud-roofed stone-walled house, about twenty-three zhang deep. There were six workers next to the well winding coal upwards. There were thirteen workers underground using tools to mine coal. The tunnel is only about three chi high, so the miners underground cannot lie down inside. They must enter early and leave late, unlike other places where they can work underground for more than ten days without coming out. The coal seam is about two chi thick and is two layers connected, with no stones or sand in between. The quality of the coal is average. According to experts, the coal contains a lot of ash and is mixed with pyrite, the amount of which is about 20%. The workers work in shifts of about six or seven people. Each shift is required to produce about 134 baskets of coal, each basket weighing about forty catties. All of them are sold locally and not elsewhere. The average daily wage for workers is about 60 cents, while those who wind coal are paid about 30 cents per day, and those who go down the well are paid about 90 cents. The price of coal is about 40 cents per hundred catties. There is accumulated water in the well. About forty bags of water can be pumped out every night using a cowhide bag. There are two roads in the well, one flat and one slightly inclined, running southwest for about ten zhang. The wellhead is round, with a major diameter of six chi and a minor diameter of four chi, and cost about 1,000 yuan to dig. Charcoal is burned next to the well to send hot air to the well below for ventilation. The coal is wound from the bottom of the well to the ground, which takes about two minutes each time.</p>
<p>In addition to Qiao'ergou, oil seepage has also been found in Xijiazhuang, Dengjiagou in the western district of the county, and Long'ersi in the southern district. In addition to the aforementioned Liujiagou coal mine, there are also coal mines in Cuijiage, forty-five li northeast of the county, Baijiaya Village, thirty-five li northeast of the county, and Panlong Village, twenty-five li southeast of the county. They have already been exploited. The coal is black and smoky. The coal area is about twenty square li, with reserves of about fourteen trillion tons.</p>
<p>After the investigation was completed at 2:00 PM, it rained heavily again. The mud roads were slippery and impassable. Mr. Hong Jinglan fell and got up again and again. The situation only improved slightly after leaving the ditch, but when the horses galloped, the mud and water splashed on our clothes, which made us feel quite embarrassed.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Small Factories and Others <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>In addition to mineral products, Fushi has four small factories, which were surveyed as follows: 1. Fuxingde Felt Workshop: The felt produced is three chi wide and five chi long. Each felt requires three catties of wool and one catty of millet flour. Five pieces of felt can be made per day. The workshop has five workers. The wages are about six or seven yuan per month. Each person makes about one piece of felt per day. 2. Yongji Carpet Factory: The carpet produced is two chi wide and four chi long, with 100 stitches. One carpet requires one catty of raw materials (including miscellaneous materials), five catties of light wool, and one catty of thread. There are four looms. Each carpet requires ten man-days to make and about three yuan in wages. 3. Yufeng Sock Factory: There are four machines. Thirty pairs of socks can be produced per day. The sock thread is of two types, 42-count and 16-count, both from Shanxi. The price is 12-13 yuan per package for 42-count and 7 yuan per package for 16-count. Each package can make 4-5 dozen socks, and each dozen sells for 3.5 yuan. 4. Yishun Carpet Factory: The carpet woven is three chi wide and five chi long, with 100 stitches. Each piece costs 24 yuan. Generally, each square chi requires one catty of wool at a cost of 20 cents per catty. Each worker only weaves three or four inches per day. It takes twenty man-days to make one carpet, and the cost is about 20 yuan. The cost of dyes is about 50 cents per catty, and the dyeing fee for each 14 catties of wool (i.e., one carpet) is about 2 yuan. The factory has four workers and two looms. Each worker can weave one catty of thread per day.</p>
<p>Other information is as follows: 1. The total area of the county is 5,600 square li, and the total population is over 21,000 people. 2. There is a natural forest in the Nangou area of the southern district, covering an area of about 12 square li. 3. The mountains produce many medicinal herbs, such as Artemisia capillaris, Leonurus japonicus, Xanthium sibiricum, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, Prunus armeniaca, Lycium chinense, Tussilago farfara, Taraxacum mongolicum, Pharbitis nil, Foeniculum vulgare, Dolichos lablab, Oxalis corniculata, Ephedra sinica, Dioscorea opposita, Sophora japonica, Spiraea japonica, Euphorbia humifusa, and Cicada slough. 4. The furs include cattle, sheep, foxes, and wolves. The local livestock breeding industry is quite prosperous, and a large amount of white and black wool is produced. Special products include Russula vinosa and others. 5. In terms of historical sites, the Huayuantou area in the southern district is full of peonies, which were planted by Du Fu of the Tang Dynasty when he took refuge from the war and lived in seclusion. Ten li north of the county seat is where Di Qing of the Song Dynasty was imprisoned. The place is still called Di Qing Prison, and the remains are still there. In addition, Fan Zhongyan's large-character calligraphy in Jialing and Fan Gong's Well in Nanzhai are also very famous.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Huang Bokui Returns <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Bokui separated from us in Yijun to investigate the coal mines in the countryside alone with a donkey. It has been seven days since he left, and he has not yet returned to the team. Some team members were worried about accidents. On the afternoon of the 28th, Mr. Huang suddenly rushed back. Everyone was overjoyed to see him again. Mr. Huang's trip was very successful. His report is disclosed below.</p>
<p>I (Huang said, the same below) heard the Director of the Bureau of Construction in Yijun say that the coal mine in Yishicun, 110 li west of the county, has a coal seam that is more than three zhang thick, the coal mine in Jiaoping Town, 50 li west of the county, has a coal seam that is about seven or eight chi thick, and the coal mine in Qilitun, 90 li north of the county, has a coal seam that is about four chi thick. Therefore, on the 22nd, I separated from the team in Yijun and went to investigate. County Magistrate Zhang Doushan sent a police officer and two soldiers to protect me. I departed from Yijun at 9:00 AM and rested once after traveling 22 li west. At the 25-li point, I reached a temple. The police officer asked to rest again, and I reluctantly agreed. Unexpectedly, the police officer slept soundly in the temple for two hours. After I repeatedly urged him, he slowly proceeded. I arrived at Jiping Town at 4:00 PM. The distance from Yijun to here is 50 li. There is a battalion of defense troops stationed there. There are no more troops stationed further west. The Yijun County District Office is located here. The district chief, Yan, is illiterate. It is said that Koukou is located another five or sixty li away and appears and disappears unpredictably. Jiaozhen has been occupied three times. It is now reported that Koukou has been found in Phoenix Mountain, about 30 li from the town. I shouldn't be able to go to Yishicun, I should sleep with my clothes on tonight, and escape east as soon as I hear gunfire. The situation seems very tense. I entrusted him to introduce a miner who had worked in Yishicun to talk. The miner came to see me in the evening. I asked him about the coal mine in Yishicun, which uses a straight well to wind coal. The well is 12-13 zhang to 15-16 zhang deep. The thickness of the coal seam varies greatly. The thickest is three zhang, and the thinnest is over one zhang. There is gas in the mine that can ignite spontaneously, so more than one well has been abandoned because of this. Some also stopped due to water. The coal is sold on the mine at a price of three corners of the ocean per load (200-300 catties) and is sold in the areas of Xi'an, Sanyuan, Fuping, and Yaoxian. I asked if there were any coal mines nearby. It is said that the Cuijiagou, 20 li west of the town, is currently producing coal. The next morning (23rd), I discussed with District Chief Yan to ask him to send someone to guide me. Yan strongly advised me not to go, saying that Cuijiagou is located at the foot of Phoenix Mountain, and he could not be responsible. Moreover, the situation of the mine has already been explained in detail by the miners, and there is absolutely no difference in what I would see and hear if I went to investigate, so it is not worth going. I told him that I came specifically to investigate coal mines, and it would be a pity if I couldn't see them with my own eyes. Therefore, I decided to go. Yan then sent three militiamen to protect me, and the three soldiers sent by the county government also went with me. After traveling 10 li west to Yaoxian Village, I saw a coal kiln about one li west of the village. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>1. A straight well is four chi in diameter and twenty-five chi deep. There is accumulated water in the well. Water is currently being drawn out with wooden buckets, one bucket at a time, about 30 catties per bucket. Coal cannot be produced. The well is dug down through mud. There is no rock above the coal seam. Four or five workers are used to dig every day. It took three months to see coal. The wages are three corners of the ocean. The cost is about 100 yuan in total. There are no supports.</p>
<p>2. A sloping well is dug towards the northeast, with a slope of about 30 degrees and a slope length of 35-36 chi. There is no water. There is currently one miner digging, and the coal he digs is split equally between him and the owner.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Director Dong Xiujia of the Jiangsu Construction Department Discusses Construction Projects <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Explanation of Submitting Half of the Land Tax for Road Construction to the Province</p>
<p>Plans to Build Ten Main Roads, Requiring an Estimated Budget of Over Seven Million</p>
<p>Subsidies for Various Counties to Dredge Rivers and Repair Embankments, Approximately 700,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, while traveling to Shanghai on business, this reporter happened to share a car with Dong Xiujia, the Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department. I took the opportunity to engage in a thorough conversation and inquire about the recent issue of Jiangsu Province's counties submitting half of the land tax for road construction to the province. Director Dong provided detailed answers, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>I asked: "It is said that some counties have raised objections to the decision that all counties in Jiangsu Province should submit half of the land tax for road construction to the province, to be used as funding for national and provincial road construction. Is this true?"</p>
<p>Director Dong replied: "Recently, counties such as Wuxi, Taicang, and Baoshan have stated that submitting half of the land tax for road construction to the province is inconsistent with the original plan and suspect that provincial funds are being used for county purposes. They have sent telegrams to the province to stop this. However, this is largely due to misunderstandings. The provincial government has already issued explanations, and many enlightened individuals in the counties, after careful consideration, can readily resolve these issues."</p>
<p>I asked: "Is the land tax for road construction specifically intended for the construction of county roads? Now, half of it is being submitted to the province for the construction of national and provincial roads. Is this inconsistent with the original plan's nature?"</p>
<p>Director Dong replied: "The decision to collect land tax for road construction was made in the winter of the 17th year of the Republic (1928-1929). However, at that time, the highway plan was not yet complete, so there was no distinction between national and provincial roads. Later, due to the varying lengths of roads, the shortest roads were designated as county roads, those passing through two or more counties were designated as provincial roads, and those passing through two or more provinces were designated as national roads. In fact, both provincial and national roads pass through the boundaries of various counties and serve as county roads. The reason why it was not named 'county road land tax' but 'land tax for road construction' is precisely because of this. Moreover, in terms of the definitions of national, provincial, and county roads, they are merely indicative of main and branch lines and do not have special distinctions. Since all national and provincial road lines inevitably traverse the jurisdictions of various counties, dividing them into segments essentially makes them the main trunk lines of county roads. Without trunk lines, what benefit do branch lines have? The relationship with trunk lines is more important than any other branch lines. Therefore, using half of the land tax to fund construction is no different from each county constructing its county roads. Furthermore, recently, when constructing roads such as the Chu-Su Provincial Road and the Hu-Hang Provincial Road, counties through which the routes passed all allocated land tax to fund the projects. All counties were happy to contribute, and the records are available. No one has raised objections. This further demonstrates that the province-wide land tax for road construction is intended for the construction of roads throughout the province and is not divided based on the names of national, provincial, and county roads to be mutually exclusive. Moreover, the original plan for collecting land tax for road construction in the winter of the 17th year of the Republic was approved by the 103rd meeting of the provincial government. It stipulated that the collected funds 'should be remitted to the Construction Department monthly for special storage and not be diverted for other uses.' The intention was that highways are an integrated whole, and it is necessary to concentrate financial resources for the overall development. If the province does not have the authority to统筹 (tǒng chóu, overall planning and coordination) and allocate, why would there be such an unnecessary regulation at that time? Later, to facilitate the management of funds, the Construction Administration Conference decided that each county should manage the funds themselves, and the method of remitting funds to the province was temporarily not implemented. Now, remitting half of the land tax to the province for management and use is to promote the development of highways in the province in a way that meets the needs and is in line with the original plan for collecting land tax, without any conflict. Moreover, Zhejiang Province has precedents for collecting an additional 10% on land tax compensation from each county for highways, as well as special construction taxes, which are all remitted to the province for management and use. This is not unique to Jiangsu. Therefore, those who believe that the plan to submit half of the land tax to the province is a change to the original plan are unaware that this method was stipulated several years ago and is only being implemented now."</p>
<p>I asked: "The land tax for road construction has not been remitted to the province according to the original plan for several years. Why is it now being remitted by half?"</p>
<p>Director Dong replied: "In the past, road construction in each county was managed independently, with little coordination. Road construction mainly focused on development within their own boundaries, with fragmented and piecemeal efforts. They rarely focused on the main trunk lines connecting the counties, leading to a situation where there were only branch lines without trunk lines. Highway transportation values connection and accessibility. Now, with only branch lines and no trunk lines, the priorities have been misplaced. Therefore, over the past four or five years, millions have been spent, but the highways in various counties of the province have shown little progress. Traffic obstruction remains the same, which is due to this. It is extremely regrettable. The Shanghai Incident this spring led to frequent military transport to the rear, and military roads were built day and night, fearing it would be too late. This shows the failure of previous work. If we do not seek other ways to improve and continue with the old rules, no matter how much money each county spends, there will be no progress in transportation. The Construction Department is responsible for the construction administration of the entire province, so we have specifically sought improvement. From now on, the construction of highways in the province must be planned comprehensively, and the urgency of each project must be determined based on the needs. We must ensure that the main trunk lines are completed first to avoid the previous fragmented and obstructive practices."</p>
<p>I asked: "After the previous explanation, it is clear that the nature of the land tax for road construction has not changed. Why do counties like Wuxi still consider the portion remitted to the province as changing county funds to provincial funds?"</p>
<p>Director Dong replied: "The land tax for road construction was originally designated for road construction. Although half of it is now remitted to the province, it is not being used for administrative expenses, nor is it considered provincial funds. It is still a special fund stored specifically for road construction and cannot be diverted for other uses. Even if it were not remitted to the province, each county would still be responsible for building national and provincial roads. Now, it is simply changing the county's custody procedures to the province's custody procedures. It has not been changed to provincial funds. The original plan for remittance to the province stipulates this in detail. It seems very appropriate to use the funds for road construction in this province for road projects in this province. It would be a misunderstanding to refer to it as changing county funds to provincial funds."</p>
<p>I asked: "How will this remitted half of the land tax be used in the future?"</p>
<p>Director Dong replied: "Road construction projects require a lot of funding, and the financial resources of each county vary. In the past, each county was managed independently. County A, if it had funds, would build roads in County A. County B, if it had funds, would build roads in County B. There was little coordination. If two wealthy counties were separated by a poor county, the traffic between the three counties would never be connected. This is the most serious consequence of this approach. From now on, we will plan comprehensively and handle matters based on the needs. This year, we will use the collected funds to build trunk roads in counties A and B. Next year, we can use the collected funds to build trunk roads in counties C and D. Although there will be a sequence of implementation, there will be no preferential treatment in the allocation of funds. We expect that within three years, highway transportation throughout the province will be unhindered, and the public will not be disappointed."</p>
<p>I asked: "Which are the main roads to be built this year, and what is the estimated cost?"</p>
<p>Director Dong replied: "There are currently ten main roads to be built, requiring an estimated budget of over seven million yuan." (At this point, Director Dong showed a list of planned highways and costs.) "Relying solely on land tax is insufficient. The National Economic Commission has also agreed to lend funds from the provincial road construction fund, which is a considerable amount. However, the condition is that the province must be able to raise sufficient funds to start construction before the loan is granted. This is a rare opportunity that will greatly benefit the development of highways in the province. If we miss this opportunity, it will be difficult to raise large amounts of funds elsewhere. Therefore, the method of submitting half of the land tax for road construction to the province is the only way to develop public road projects in the province."</p>
<p>I asked: "What is the situation with the counties reporting and submitting half of the land tax for road construction recently?"</p>
<p>Director Dong replied: "Since the announcement of this plan, more than forty counties throughout the province have reported that they will comply. More than ten counties have submitted daily and monthly reports of collections. Some counties have already remitted the July collections. In general, all counties understand the overall situation, and we can be optimistic about future remittances. Although a few local groups in the counties have some misunderstandings and doubts, the provincial government has repeatedly explained the matter carefully, and we believe they will fully understand."</p>
<p>Attached is a list of planned highway construction expenditures for Jiangsu Province this year:</p>
<p>Item 	Estimated Expenditure</p>
<p>Su-Jia Road (Wujiang Section)	868,106 Yuan</p>
<p>Su-Jia Road (Wuxian Section)	150,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Jing-Hu Road (Xi-Hu Section)	1,317,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Jing-Si Road	590,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Dong-Chu Road	1,284,700 Yuan</p>
<p>Jiang-Huai Road	927,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Jiang-Ju Road	308,517 Yuan</p>
<p>Huai-Pi Road	949,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Huai-Hai Road	878,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Jiangyin-Changshu Road	715,800 Yuan</p>
<p>Total	7,986,677 Yuan</p>
<p>I asked: "Jiangsu Province is an agricultural region. Construction projects should focus on water conservancy. Why is your department planning to construct so many highways this year? Many people have doubts. Can you explain the rationale?"</p>
<p>Director Dong replied: "Agriculture and water conservancy are closely related. Therefore, this department pays special attention to water conservancy projects in various counties. Last year, when various counties in Jiangnan and Jiangbei organized work relief projects, this department approved and allocated special construction funds such as land tax for road construction to subsidize the counties in dredging rivers. We are currently formulating detailed plans, regulations, and fundraising strategies. We plan to order all county magistrates and directors of construction bureaus to fully mobilize and start work after October. If the waterways cannot be completed this year, dredging will continue next winter to ensure that the province's rivers are clear, providing the benefits of irrigation in drought years and preventing flooding in wet years. Although road construction may seem unrelated to agriculture on the surface, it is actually a way to develop agriculture. The value of agricultural products lies in their ability to be sold in various markets. If transportation is inconvenient, even if water conservancy is well-maintained and agricultural products are abundant, if they cannot be transported to various places for sale, the income of farmers will not increase. Furthermore, banditry has been rampant in various places recently. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission believes that to eliminate bandits, roads must first be built to facilitate military operations. Therefore, most of the above roads were ordered to be built urgently by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Ministry of Military Affairs. After examining the actual situation, areas with difficult transportation are often areas where bandits are rampant. Therefore, for the sake of the province's security, it is necessary to actively build roads."</p>

<p>Notorious Bandit Wu Xiaopangzi Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>The notorious Anhui gang bandit Wu Xiaopangzi, also known as Hu Zhanghe, was formerly a small leader under Wu Dajinzi, the leader of the Anhui gang. In the winter of the 17th year of the Republic (1928-1929), he opened fire on the water police in Qingpu, killing Captain Zhang Sida. In the 19th year of the Republic (1930), he committed a series of kidnapping and robbery cases in Qingpu. The Qingpu County Government offered a reward of 300 yuan for his capture. He was captured by the First District Water Police on August 30th at the Longwang Temple in Zhujing and sent to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, which sentenced him to death. The sentence has been submitted to the province for review.</p>

<p>Arrest of Gang of Robbers of Sailing Vessels</p>
<p>County Magistrate Chen recently, due to the constant occurrence of robberies on land and water in both urban and rural areas, is deeply concerned about the future of public security. He has strictly ordered his subordinates to cooperate in arresting the criminals within a limited time. Xue Furui, the captain of the Detective Squad of the County Public Security Bureau, upon receiving the order, immediately led Detectives Dai and Shen, as well as all the detectives, to investigate separately. On the 7th of this month, Captain Xue received a tip from an informant and immediately set out, first arresting Liu Desheng near the Yuchang Silk Factory outside the South Gate, and then Zhou Yongchang, another robber, in front of the Qian Shen Silk Factory. Both were taken into custody for strict interrogation and confessed to the truth about the robbery. He immediately followed the locations provided and investigated separately. Until dawn yesterday morning, he intercepted a stolen boat under the Miaogang Bridge in the East Gate, arresting Li Fuwan, a robber who participated in the robbery of Shen Jianhua's sailing vessel from Suzhou to Yuqi Town in this county on the 4th of this month, as well as two female bandits, Li Xue and Zhu Ji. A pistol, two axes, a wallet, six pawn tickets, seventeen large and small straw mats, and gray cloth military uniforms, military hats, burlap sacks, etc., totaling dozens of items, were found on the boat. Yesterday, all were taken to the Detective Squad for safekeeping. Captain Xue thoroughly interrogated the suspects, who confessed to the robbery of the Yuqi sailing vessel. In the afternoon, the five male and female bandits were presented to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Begins Tax Collection</p>
<p>The Ministry and Provincial authorities have been competing to manage the tobacco and alcohol license tax. Recently, the Executive Yuan ordered the Provincial Government to cancel the original proposal and return the collection to the Ministry of Finance. All tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus established by the provinces, branches in various districts, and collection offices in various counties were ordered by the Ministry of Finance to transfer the order to the Finance Department for immediate cancellation. It has been learned that Chen Henian, the selected commissioner of the Jiangsu Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, has been appointed as the director of the Wuxi Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Branch Bureau. The bureau's address has been found at No. 1, Changle Lane, Wanqian Road, outside Guangfu Gate, and it was officially established yesterday (the 11th). He took office and announced to tobacco and alcohol merchants the commencement of the collection of the autumn tobacco and alcohol license tax. If tobacco and alcohol merchants have already paid taxes to the bureaus established by the former Finance Department and have obtained licenses, they are allowed to use the tax amount on the face of the licenses to offset the current payment and re-obtain the autumn licenses in accordance with the levels stipulated in the regulations promulgated by the Ministry. Such flexible tax payment methods ensure that tobacco and alcohol merchants do not suffer losses. Those who have not paid taxes should promptly pay taxes and obtain licenses in accordance with the regulations to facilitate business operations.</p>

<p>Zhang Burong Killed by Bandits</p>
<p>Zhang Burong, a resident of Zhuzhuang Township, Tenth District of the county, was chatting with his neighbors in the rice field a few days ago when two men in short shirts suddenly arrived. They took out pistols and said to Zhang, "Are you Zhang Burong? Our battalion commander is waiting for you." As they spoke, they dragged Zhang away. When they reached halfway, he refused to go any further. Another bandit then drew out a sharp blade and stabbed a hole in Zhang's nose, threaded it with a rope, and dragged him along. When they reached the southern wilderness, about two li from Zhang's house, another bandit came and said to Zhang, "You're here? We're inviting you back to your hometown today." After speaking, he raised his gun and fired four shots in a row, killing Zhang. After Zhang died, they used a large knife to cut off his limbs and head. It is said that Zhang's wife has reported to the county government requesting the arrest of the murderers.</p>

The numbers in parentheses () are the numbers of normal and vocational schools attached to middle or junior high schools. The numbers in parentheses () are the numbers of schools that have not submitted reports. 3. There are only twelve high schools in the country that are set up independently. Among these twelve schools, some have attached junior high schools that are not much different from complete middle schools. Moreover, according to the middle school regulations, high schools cannot be set up independently unless there are special circumstances. Therefore, for the sake of convenient calculation and to avoid ambiguity, all these high schools are included in the middle school category. (End)</p>

The newly appointed Director of Student Affairs Wang and the Director of Academic Affairs both gave earnest speeches. Professor Xie Gongzhan also gave a speech.</p>

<p>Friendly Match with British Army Scheduled for Tomorrow</p>
<p>丨Mr. Sheng Pingchen Actively Striving for Improvement丨</p>
<p>Recently, the news of the reorganization of the Donghua Football Club has been widely spread. People who are enthusiastic about it are scrambling to inquire about the exact situation of the reorganization and the plans for the future. Various newspapers have published reports. The following is a detailed record of the Donghua reorganization process and plans:</p>
<p>The motive for organizing Donghua was entirely due to Mr. Sheng Pingchen's feeling that after the dispersal of the Yuehua team, there was a lack of a strong football team in Shanghai to show the strength of the Chinese. With the support of people from all walks of life and the consent of former Yuehua team members Zhou Xianyan, Chen Yu, and Li Qing, the team was painstakingly organized. Since its establishment, although it has only been a year, it has been able to occupy a considerable position in the Shanghai football scene and has been praised by people from all walks of life. Unfortunately, the January 28th Incident suddenly occurred, and all industries in Shanghai were affected, and football matches were invisibly suspended. Since then, the football atmosphere in Shanghai has become so cold that no one has consulted about it. The work of the Donghua Football Club has also become silent. Due to the war, some team members traveled to Southeast Asia, some retired to their hometowns, and some joined other summer football clubs for entertainment. Mr. Sheng temporarily shelved the matter due to the lack of direction. Now, as the various industries are recovering after the war, people from all walks of life have also been aroused by the enthusiasm of the summer football matches and have awakened and recalled the old events of Donghua. They inevitably speculate due to their enthusiastic hope, resulting in many misunderstandings. However, Mr. Sheng is making every effort to plan a good direction for the Donghua club affairs, so as to thoroughly reform it. Mr. Sheng, since the initial organization of Donghua, has painstakingly managed it, and at the same time felt various inconveniences. Therefore, with the consent of Mr. Zhou Xianyan, (this matter was around mid-July this year), he convened a meeting of Donghua football team members to discuss and strive for a reform plan. The team members then decided to elect Mr. Chen Jinjiang and Mr. Qiu Junong as directors to draft a thorough reform plan. In order to avoid being unable to do so, Mr. Sheng, Mr. Qiu, and Mr. Chen discussed and widely sought out numerous enthusiastic giants and people from all walks of life to jointly discuss and study the fundamental plan to consolidate the foundation. In addition to Mr. Sheng continuing to maintain the status quo, another large-scale outline and plan will be formulated, and in the future, it will be developed step by step according to the outline. It is heard that the outline will be drafted and announced soon, hoping that the society will criticize and support it. It is also heard that the club has now hired Mr. Li Silian as a football instructor. It is heard that Mr. Li has drafted concrete training methods, and the team members' skills will be further improved in the future. It is learned that in order to practice, the team has specially invited the Shanghai-based British Army football team to play a friendly match at the China Baseball Field tomorrow (Tuesday) afternoon. It is expected that the Shanghai football fans who have been separated from Donghua for a long time will once again flock to Rue Pere Robert, vying to see the skills of the Donghua athletes after the reorganization as soon as possible. The side of the China Baseball Field will also restore the enthusiastic scene of the past.</p>

<h3 id="e89">All-American Tennis Tournament Still Belongs to Vines <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Straight Sets: Cochet Completely Convinced</p>
<p>True Skill, Worthy of the King of Kings</p>
<p>New York, Forest Hills, 10th: Vines, the All-American and Wimbledon champion, proved today that he is indeed one level higher than Cochet. In today's singles championship final of the All-American Tennis Tournament, Vines defeated Cochet in straight sets to retain the championship.</p>
<p>Three Consecutive 6-4 Scores: Vines' performance was wonderful, full of confidence and determination, to defeat his strong opponent. The first set was 6-4, the second set was also 6-4, and the third set was still 6-4.</p>
<p>Cochet's Second Failure: This is Cochet's second failure to Vines. The first time was the Davis Cup final between France and the United States, where Vines won in five sets, with scores of 4-6, 0-6, 7-5, 8-6, and 6-2.</p>
<p>Allison Continues Play and is Eliminated: Allison and Cochet's replay continued this morning after each winning two sets yesterday and the game was unfinished due to darkness. As a result, Cochet won the deciding fifth set 7-5 with a score of three to two and gained the right to play in the final. The five set scores were 1-6, 12-10, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5.</p>
<p>Aftermath of the Davis Cup: Cochet has not been to the United States for four years. This time he crossed the Atlantic to compete with Vines. Who is higher and who is lower? The French said that the failure in the Davis Cup at that time was different, because France had already won the United States three to one and retained the silver cup. The gain or loss of the fifth group was no longer important. Therefore, not many people attached importance to Vines' victory at that time. Now that the true skill has been seen, there is nothing to argue about.</p>
<p>The Truth About the Davis Cup Dispute: Moreover, at that time, the Davis Cup final between France and the United States increased the frustration and resentment of the American team due to Vines' victory over Cochet. On the first day of the final, the United States lost both singles matches. On the second day, they recovered one point in doubles. Therefore, if they could win both singles matches on the third day, they would win back the silver cup. In the last two singles matches, Barrocutra first played against Allison. In the first and second sets, Allison won with scores of 6-1 and 6-3 respectively. However, Barrocutra won the third and fourth sets with scores of 6-4 and 6-2, tying the score at two to two. In the deciding fifth set, Allison was ahead with a score of 5-4. In the tenth game, Allison won another point and was about to win the game. When Barrocutra served, 12,000 people in the audience were worried for Barrocutra. The first ball touched the net. The second ball would determine Barrocutra's fate. According to Allison's observation from the moment the racket was raised, the ball was a few inches outside the serving boundary line, and he thought he had won and went straight to shake hands with Barrocutra. However, looking back, the linesman did not call the ball "out," and the referee followed suit. Allison was stunned at this time, full of resentment. The joy turned to hatred, and the audience was in an uproar. Allison was so angry that he could not control the ball and ended up failing with a score of 7-5. The American team's glimmer of hope for the Davis Cup was ruined by this linesman. Isn't that tragic? Whether France or the United States will win this year's Davis Cup is still an unresolved issue in the public opinion.</p>

<p>Last Week's Gold Market Initially Fell, then Rose</p>
<p>Over the past week, the gold market experienced slight fluctuations and a state of confusion, which was ultimately difficult to suppress. Although there were no excessively large waves, the price fluctuated by six or seven taels daily. Within the industry, bullish and bearish trends diverged. Initially, due to the recovery of overseas silver markets and frequent increases in exchange rates, the price broke through the 700-tael mark, opening at 698.8 taels. Subsequently, due to the loosening of local bills of exchange, a low price of 693.2 taels was suddenly seen on Tuesday, marking four consecutive days of decline. Afterwards, advances and retreats were sudden, hovering around 700 taels. Furthermore, although the silver market continued to rise, Shanghai bills of exchange tended to move in the opposite direction due to settlement requirements. Gradually, the gold price shifted from weak to strong, and the rising trend became more intense. The silver market began to shrink, and the Central Bank vigorously absorbed spot goods, resulting in fewer reserves in the market. Gold delivery chips became increasingly scarce, and the market price soared sharply. On Friday, the momentum was unparalleled, breaking through the 710-tael mark and reaching 717.8 taels. However, due to conflicting foreign news on that day, there were fluctuations. Afterwards, it seemed to reverse and decline slightly, resulting in 712.6 taels. Overall, compared to the previous week, it continued to rise by 11.4 taels, with a total difference of 24.6 taels between the highest and lowest points of the week. The opening and closing prices differed by a rise of 13.8 taels. As for the prices of British and American silver, they continued to fall slightly, with the Sterling exchange rate initially shrinking by one tick (0.25), and the US dollar exchange rate shrinking by only 0.0125 due to the squeeze in large exchanges. The internal market decreased by only 0.0625, while Sterling decreased by 0.125. Initially loose and then firm, the industry initially sold off and then bought back, generally hedging positions. However, the hedge price was slightly close, with the forward price widening by more than 40 taels and the near-term price within 50 taels. However, the exchange rate initially rose for several days before a slight decline due to a reversal. This week, the British pound continued to rise by 1.5 cents against the US dollar, and the US dollar also rose by 1.75 cents against the British pound. According to recent statistics, the gold transaction volume is approximately 22,000 contracts. The Dalian group still holds a slight bullish advantage, while Guang group Hengxing is still bearish, and Yifeng has turned bullish. Although Yifeng, Yonggan, Changxiang, Yuanxing, and Yong et al. are all bullish, their volume is not as large as the previous week due to successive sales. Yesterday (the 11th), a large contract returned to be long, and today's gold market is feared to be not optimistic. The high and low prices of British and American silver markets and exchange rates are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, because it was Monday and banks were not open for business, the market was quiet as usual, so there were few transactions in the market. The overnight rate was 6 qian 8 fen 1 li 8 hao 7 hu ban in the morning market and 6 qian 9 fen 1 li 7 hao ban in the afternoon market. As a result, it improved by 1 hao 2 hu ban compared to the afternoon market the day before. The interbank call loan rates in the morning and afternoon markets both opened at 3 fen, down 1 fen. The amount of exchange and remittance transactions was purely limited. Only 300,500 in the morning market and even less in the morning market, only 155,000. Only banknote transactions were made in the morning market, with off-market transactions of 30,000. There was no news of other transactions. Money shops collected and settled more than 4.3 million in silver notes, more than 22 million in silver notes, more than 300,000 in remittances from various routes, and more than 400,000 in transactions by small money shops. The early market price of auxiliary coins Jiangnan small silver was 5 qian 9 fen 8 li 7 hao ban, and the afternoon market was 5 qian 9 fen 8 li. 6,500 jiao were transacted in the morning market and 4,500 jiao in the afternoon market.

Copper coins were lengthened by 500 wen, totaling 433,000 qian wen, with 51,960 strings of wen transacted, equivalent to 12,000 taels of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Securities: Quiet Bond Market Last Week <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Total Transaction Volume Only Exceeded 10 Million</p>
<p>Prices Trended Slightly Firmer, Fluctuations Remained Sluggish</p>
<p>Over the past week, from September 5th to 10th, the conditions of the spot and futures markets for various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained sparse. Market sentiment showed little sign of recovery. Although many types of spot goods were traded, there were only sporadic transactions. The total transaction volume for the week was 92,000 yuan, of which 20% bonds accounted for 19,000 yuan, and decommissioning 19% customs salt tax and finance 20% customs averaged about 10,000 yuan each. The only difference from the previous week was that continuation 25% and rehabilitation spot, which had been absent from the market for a long time, each opened at 1,000 yuan. There were still no transactions for the October futures. Although the transaction volume for the September contract was slightly higher than the previous week, the market sentiment remained very cold. There were still few large-scale entries and exits from various parties. Looking at the daily transaction situation, Monday and Thursday each saw approximately 2 million yuan, Tuesday and the weekend each saw 1.56 million yuan, and Wednesday was the quietest, with only 1.1 million yuan. The total was 10.195 million yuan, an increase of more than 2.5 million yuan compared to the previous week. China Salt Tax and disbanding soldiers saw slightly more transactions than others, with 2.4 million yuan for salt tax and 1.91 million yuan for disbanding soldiers. The remainder was very quiet, with 865,000 yuan for 20% customs, 825,000 yuan for 20% bonds, 820,000 yuan for 19% customs, 465,000 yuan for decommissioning, 145,000 yuan for customs tax, 125,000 yuan for consolidation of 6% interest, and 5,000 yuan for finance. There was no market for 96 bonds. Regarding the price changes of various bonds, they became increasingly stable. The daily fluctuations throughout the week were extremely small, a sluggish situation unseen in recent years. It is estimated that there were only 2-3 jiao of fluctuations per day. The total fluctuation for the week was only 5-6 jiao. This was because there was little development in the domestic situation and diplomatic conditions during the week. The bond market environment can be said to have been without any changes. Therefore, market sentiment was cautious, there were no transactions from large accounts, and entries and exits from various parties were scarce. Supply and demand were extremely flat. As a result, with the environment stable and the market sporadically needing to be unquiet, prices always tended to fluctuate and become firmer. Wednesday and Saturday were slightly weak, while the remaining days generally rose slightly. Compared to the previous week, finance alone fell by 5-6 jiao, while the others rose by 2-3 jiao to 7-8 jiao. The bond market situation continues to be extremely chaotic, and it is difficult to expect an immediate turnaround in its future. It will depend on how the situation brews in various aspects to determine its trend. Also, from this week onwards, the Securities Exchange has decided to appropriately reduce the special margin deposit due to the quiet and stable market. The high, low, and fluctuation conditions of various bond prices during the past week are listed in the following table (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Last Week’s Cotton Yarn Market Declined Continuously</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Consumption Became Even Quieter</p>
<p>At the beginning of last week, the situation for cotton yarn was extremely weak. Scattered short sellers, due to sluggish real demand, dumped their holdings in unison. Therefore, the price lingered and fluctuated between 154 and 155 taels for a long time. However, the long position of Rongxing remained steadfast, and the two sides, long and short, held their ground strongly. Unexpectedly, the US cotton government's estimate, released on September 8, showed a slight increase in production, and the market plummeted. The local people were greatly shocked, and the long sellers were disappointed. The market dropped by 3 taels. However, the long position of Yongan Kang not only did not sell but instead bought in and increased its position. Scattered households mostly tended to sell short, resulting in an increasing number of open account transactions. Currently, the inventory of various factories is still low. The future situation of US cotton is still uncertain. The future changes are unpredictable. The total transaction volume of cotton yarn for the week was 171,750 bales. Prices for all months fell by 2.89 qian to 3.89 qian compared to the previous week. The spot yarn business was originally quiet. In light of the turmoil in the futures market, there was even less intention to purchase, and transactions were even fewer. The total daily transaction volume was 4,031 bales. The market price fell by about 2 taels. The purchase volume of each guild is recorded below:</p>
<p>Guild Number of Bales Guild Number of Bales Guild Number of Bales Guild Number of Bales</p>
<p>Inland 1,225 Guangdong 1,610 Zhenjiang 160 Fujian 165</p>

<p>US Cotton Production Quantity Increased</p>
<p>In the past week, the cotton market experienced a very large decline. Because of the booming output of Ningbo Jinyi Yaohua cotton, there was deep concern about low prices in the future market, so large-scale hedging sales were carried out on the exchange. On Monday, more than 40,000 dan were sold, and the market fell by more than one tael. The firm upward momentum in Shanghai was broken. Before long, because the trend of US cotton was still good and Japanese merchants had news of purchasing Chinese cotton for export, the spot cotton situation in the market was unusually brisk, and market prices recovered slightly. However, a certain manufacturer sold off whenever prices rose. It was found that the amount sold was as large as 160,000 dan, and it was finally suppressed. However, Yongan Factory absorbed it on dips, about 60,000-70,000 dan. In terms of the general trend of the cotton market, the price of Chinese cotton is relatively cheap, so there is occasional news of foreign merchants bundling and exporting it. According to a portion of the purchased futures quantity, the amount is considerable. Currently, because this year's harvest is still good in all directions, and new cotton is being listed vigorously, sellers are taking the opportunity to suppress prices. If the US cotton 8-fen mark can stand firm and the gold price is around 700 taels, the future of Chinese cotton still has good prospects. Unexpectedly, the US government's second estimate, released on August 8, showed that the production quantity not only did not decrease, but also increased slightly, resulting in New York cotton prices plummeting by more than one cent. The stable situation of cotton futures was also completely broken. It was difficult for scattered longs to support the market, and the market fell like a runaway horse down a steep slope, falling a thousand feet straight down, with a drop of more than one tael in one session. But the buyers remained unmoved. It was found that the total transaction volume of cotton futures for the week was 69,700 dan, and the price of each month fell by 1.89 qian compared to the previous week. The sales of spot cotton in the market were relatively lively. Compared to the previous week, US cotton fell by 80 pounds. The sources at the docks included 3,020 bales of Yaohua cotton and 800 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The spot cotton purchased by various manufacturers is recorded below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially weak due to good weather, but later became firm due to buying by peers and short covering. It is estimated that futures rose by 1-4 pounds. Spot prices were unchanged. British cotton futures rose by 10-12 points, and spot prices rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. Indian cotton initially rose with US cotton, but softened after long liquidation. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 2.25 rupees. Aomula rose by 2 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 3 rupees.

<p>Pujiang Rice Market Downturn Stabilized</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market in South Shanghai was overcast and rainy in the morning. The supply from various guilds was not abundant. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching and the relationship between accounts and silver, people were calm and transactions were sluggish. Ordinary goods felt more sluggish. The new japonica rice market improved in price. Thin rice and scattered goods from the Jiangsu guild also had no appeal. Rural consumers had slight transactions, and the market did not rise or fall. New and aged ocean-produced top-quality goods were scarce, and the market felt tight.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market in Xinzha was not active. Although there were many people near the market in the morning, the shops had a calm attitude, and the market situation was difficult to grasp. Changxi North Japonica and early and late rice were lower than the previous day, in fact due to the abundant bottom reserves, and people were bearish. New Japonica and new ocean-produced top-quality goods did not sell well, and transactions by customer guilds were sluggish, making it difficult for the overall market to improve.</p>

<p>Silk Market Resumed Changes Last Week</p>
<p>New York and Lyon Had Ample Silk Stocks, Factory Purchases Relaxed</p>
<p>Japanese Silk Price Suppression and Dumping Caused Sharp Falls in Silk Prices Again</p>
<p>Over the past week, the overseas raw silk market has resumed drastic changes. European and American silk weavers, in view of the low quality of Japanese silk and the gradual rise in prices, and that Japanese silk cannot be used to weave silk alone, coupled with poor global silk production, have all started to abandon purchasing Japanese silk and instead purchase Chinese silk. The Shanghai silk market has improved daily. However, Japanese silk merchants are keen to compete, and have actively transported large quantities of Japanese silk to European and American markets, so that the stocks of raw silk in New York and Lyon and other ports have suddenly become abundant, and factory purchases have relaxed. Japanese silk merchants then resumed the old trick of suppressing prices and dumping silk in the middle of last week. The price of Japanese silk fell by 170-180 yen, which severely affected Chinese silk, and the price also fell sharply, with a drop of 12 cents per pound. Shanghai silk sales suddenly became quiet and tired on the weekend, and European and American banks were all watching. In the middle of last week, a total of more than 300 packages of spot and futures silk were traded, and more than 200 packages were exported. The price of Chinese silk in the European and American markets at the end of last week is listed below (New York price per pound, unit: US dollars; Lyon price per kilo, unit: francs):</p>

<p>Public Security Bureau Strictly Guarding Against Communists</p>
<p>According to the National Society, the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a tip-off yesterday morning that the Communist Party held a meeting of representatives from various districts and departments of the Communist Party in the rooftop garden of the Sincere Company a few days ago. It was decided that representatives from each district would be responsible for separately notifying workers in various factories in the Shanghai West and East areas to unanimously assist unemployed workers throughout Shanghai. On the afternoons of the 7th, 9th and 10th, the Communist Party's false Central Committee convened a secret meeting in Shanghai of all executive committee members and executive committee representatives from various districts and departments in Jiangsu Province to promote communism, distribute reactionary leaflets, and carry out riots. Because the authorities in both the Chinese and French concessions had received reports in advance and ordered strict precautions, the meeting did not take place. Later, it was changed to 6 pm yesterday (the 11th) for a secret meeting in the Rue Mazellan area of the French Concession to convene a meeting, organize a parade and demonstration, and launch a riot, taking the opportunity to gather in the Tangjiawan area of the Chinese area and distribute leaflets on Zhonghua Road and Minguo Road, etc. After receiving the report, the bureau notified the Police Department of the French Municipal Council, closed the iron gates at Tangjiawan, Nanyang Bridge, and other intersections between the Chinese and French concessions, and ordered the police chiefs of various districts to order special precautions. The entire inspectors of the Supervision Department and the entire detectives of the Detective Team were ordered to go to various intersections to be on alert (implementing inspections in case of suspicious persons). There were also police patrols and vehicle patrols to take separate routes to prevent and curb chaos.</p>

<p>Departing on the Zhinakala Ship of the Java Company the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>Jiang Guangnai, Director of Pacification of Fujian, and Cai Tingkai, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Army, have been in Shanghai for several days. According to sources close to Jiang and Cai, Cai was originally scheduled to return to Fujian on the 14th of this month after visiting Chairman Chiang in Wuhan. However, he changed his departure date to the 18th to return to Fujian with Jiang Guangnai. Recently, Director Jiang reported to Chairman Lin in person after the latter came to Shanghai and completed his mission. He has decided to cancel his trips to Xunyang and Wuhan. The two have decided to move their departure date forward to the original date, departing on the Zhinakala (Tjinegara) of the Java Company to return to Fujian together. As for the reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government, Jiang is unwilling to take the position of chairman. Although it has been discussed, it seems that no decision has been made.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Pudong Native Place Association Requests the Restoration of the Gaoqiao Municipal Office <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Pudong Native Place Association received a letter from members Ma Baosen and others regarding the abolition of the Gaoqiao Municipal Office, requesting that it be forwarded to the government for restoration. The standing committee members of the association submitted a document to the municipal government, stating: "Submitting a report on the local panic caused by the abolition of the Gaoqiao Municipal Committee Office, requesting a review and approval for restoration." According to a letter from members Ma Baosen, Shen Zhen, Xie Bingchong, Zhou Ruiting, Li Chengfu, Yin Shijie, and Huang Shixi, Zhong Renjie, a member of the Gaoqiao Municipal Committee, suddenly resigned, and the Municipal Committee Office was immediately abolished. It is deeply feared that the autonomous administration will suddenly change to the old rules. Speculating on the future, we are extremely frightened. We implore you to submit a petition on our behalf and reinstate the office to assist the government and maintain the local area. Gaoqiao District used to belong to Baoshan and is located in the northern part of Pudong, bordering the sea to the east, the Wusong River to the west, and controlling the mouth of the Yangtze River to the north, facing Wusong. Its location is important. I have long heard that your government is strongly planning to develop Gaoqiao, because although Gaoqiao is located in Pudong, transportation is convenient, and the influence of foreign merchants is sometimes infringed upon. Therefore, if we do not plan for the development of municipal administration, it is fine. If we plan for the development of municipal administration, we should start with this district. In the past, when preparing for autonomy, Gaoqiao was designated as a district, and it was naturally considered necessary in fact. Now that Committee Member Zhong Renjie and Yang Hongjun of the Fahua District, which is connected to the concession, have resigned one after another, and the respective offices of the Municipal Committee Members have been abolished at the same time, the Committee Members Zhong and others may have resigned because of the difficulty of handling affairs and yielded to the virtuous. Your government should choose people for the area. It seems that it is impossible to give up eating for fear of choking. It is understood that Shanghai City was originally composed of nineteen cities and villages, and later divided into forty autonomous regions. The reason why the municipal committees are not set up in the South Shanghai and Zhabei areas is that there are relevant bureaus nearby. Secondly, the municipal committee in Yinxiang Township was abolished in the eighteenth year because it was designated as the city center. Now, Gaoqiao is far away from Yinxiang and north of Luhang and Gaohang in Pudong. Setting up a municipal committee to establish the pioneer of local autonomy will make a model district for our Shanghai City. This is what our association has been looking forward to day and night. If it is abolished one day, all municipal affairs will be taken over by the relevant bureaus. So that the local people must go to various bureaus for extremely trivial matters, dividing the whole into parts, which is extremely inconvenient. However, the Gaoqiao Fahua districts each abolished their offices at the time of the committee members' resignation. Outsiders will not misunderstand that the survival of the municipal office follows the advance and retreat of the individual committee members, or is it a punishment for the committee member's poor handling of affairs, and the office is abolished to satisfy the desire for quick results? The members of the association are difficult to remain silent on the sections of the letter from Ma Baosen and others. Now, only for the sake of Gaoqiao District, for the sake of municipal administration, this Gaoqiao District is far outside of Luhang and Gaohang. In other words, it can be said that it is a relatively remote place. Before there were municipal committee offices in various districts of the city, it seemed that it was not possible to make an exception to abolish them first. Please review and approve and quickly submit it to the municipal conference for reconsideration and restore the Gaoqiao Municipal Committee Office as soon as possible. As for the selection of committee members, whether to retain Zhong Renjie or to select and appoint from local people, it is up to you to decide. We dare not participate in the last discussion. We respectfully submit this report, hoping that you will review it. Sincerely submitted to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai, by Du Yong, Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Shen Menglian, and Lü Yuequan, the standing directors of the Pudong Native Place Association.</p>

<p>Central Committee members staying in Shanghai, Cheng Qian, Li Liejun, and others, telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing and Chairman Han of Shandong Province yesterday, saying, "To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing and Chairman Han in Jinan: Zhang Zongchang brought disaster to the country and harmed the people. His crimes are heinous and deserve legal sanctions to uphold national law and maintain order. Now, Zheng Jicheng and Chen Fengshan killed him, being loyal ministers to the country, filial sons at home, and righteous heroes in society, which should be rewarded for ten generations. Moreover, Zhang Zongchang was the mastermind behind the assassination of Mr. Chen Yingshi. The Premier often regretted that he was at large when he was in Japan. Now, Zheng and others are eliminating harm for the country and must not be punished by law. Moreover, at a time when powerful enemies are rampant, such loyal, filial, and righteous men should be cherished to protect the nation from danger. We should unanimously advocate a special pardon to uphold justice and preserve vitality.

<h3 id="e113">Recent Freight Situation After the Implementation of Responsible Transportation <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, since the first day of this month, the Jinpu Railway and the Huning and Ningbo-Shanghai Railways have stipulated that responsible transportation will be implemented on a trial basis at eight stations, including Shanghai North Station, Maigen Road, Coal Port, Nanjing, Shanghai South Station, Rihui Port, and Hangzhou Zhaokou. As of yesterday, responsible transportation was implemented uniformly at all stations on the two railways. The degree of reduction in freight volume in the first ten days has attracted considerable attention. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency specially investigated the actual quantities in the transportation industry. The number of train tons shipped from Maigen Road Station in October is compared with the freight situation in the ten days before the implementation of responsible transportation as follows: In the first ten days of September, a total of 78 cars of goods were shipped out, totaling 2,358 tons, of which 16 cars (393 tons) were for Nanjing Station (responsible transportation), including 13 cars of sugar (311 tons), 1 car of paper (21 tons), 1 car of matches (21 tons), and 1 car of iron (40 tons). In the last ten days of August (before the implementation of responsible transportation), a total of 115 cars of goods were shipped out, totaling 3,255 tons, of which 41 cars (1,133 tons) were for Nanjing Station. By comparison, the total freight volume decreased by 28 percent, while the freight volume under responsible transportation decreased by 65 percent. It can be seen that the freight situation is slack after responsible transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Suffering of the Grain, Bean, and Rice Industries Under Responsible Transportation <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Reply to the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grain, Oilseed Cake Industry and the Bean and Rice Industry Associations submitted a reply to the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating: "The railway's change to responsible transportation has both increased freight rates and complicated procedures. From the standpoint of merchants, our association has listed seven points of more obvious disadvantages in the general rules and sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways requesting detailed instructions and disclosing these opinions in the newspapers. Subsequently, the Ministry of Railways provided explanations, and the party committees of the two railways went to great lengths to correct them. After careful analysis, there are still some things that cannot be said. The Ministry of Railways explained, 'The ministry's resolute reforms are actually to relieve the suffering of merchants and the people.' The party committees of the two railways corrected, 'Implementing responsible transportation is precisely to facilitate the public.' The words are not unpleasant, and the intentions are not bad. However, to seek the actual implementation of responsible transportation, freight rates are increased by 10 percent, and special priority and highest priority categories are set up, with freight rates increased by 30 to 60 percent. Can the suffering of merchants and the people be relieved by this? Moreover, in the past, when goods arrived at the station, there was still a six-day storage period. Storage rent was charged only after the deadline. Now that transportation is responsible, the general rules stipulate that goods must be picked up within six office hours. The restrictions are so tight that merchants will not be able to pick up their goods on time and will often be charged the so-called storage fees and late fees. The collection is planned and certain to be obtained. Moreover, the reporting procedures are cumbersome and complicated. Is it possible to facilitate the transportation of the public in this way? Regarding the pick-up of goods, the Ministry of Railways also believes that goods arriving at the station at night are not calculated according to working hours. Because the twelve hours from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning are not working hours, the twelve-hour limit for unloading is actually equal to eighteen hours. The party committees of the two railways said that the railway bureau has now been changed to 24 hours. Tasting the two statements, the intentions are the same. Since the railway bureau considers the time from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM to be non-working hours, it should be known that our merchants are also resting during these twelve hours and cannot only do the work of unloading. Therefore, what the Ministry of Railways calls equal to eighteen hours and what the party committees of the two railways call having been changed to 24 hours are still equal to six office hours after restoration. The reason for deliberately making this statement is probably to cover people's eyes and ears. Furthermore, the Ministry of Railways said that the layers of exploitation suffered by passengers and merchants under non-responsible transportation are definitely not limited to this 10 percent. The actual expenditure of freight is 40 to 100 percent or more. The party committee said that merchants actually feel the pain of expensive freight due to the handling of the previous transportation business by intermediaries, but they did not mention it. Is this statement true? Those who handle transportation can seek clarification of the facts. However, according to the experience of our association members, apart from the Jinpu Railway, the number of forwarding companies established for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways is large, and the competition among the members is extremely fierce. The handling fees charged are extremely low. It has never been heard that it is as expensive as 40 to 100 percent or more. If the handling fees for past freight transportation really had layers of exploitation of 40 to 100 percent, then the merchants would surely applaud and rush to comply with the railway's 10 percent increase in freight rates. Why would they bother with words and rise up in opposition? It should be known that in recent times, disasters have occurred frequently, and disturbances have been frequent. Industry and commerce have declined, and this has reached its extreme. This phenomenon has long been seen in the Ministry of Railways' insight. It has taken advantage of its disadvantages to increase its burden and make the merchants sick again. It is appropriate that merchants have no choice but to abandon railway transportation and turn to water transportation. It is the railway that forces it to do so. How can merchants like to do this? Recently, in February, more than one million bags of wheat, grain, and beans were shipped to Shanghai. According to the association's investigation, the goods were completely shipped by ship. The trend of goods transportation had gradually turned to water transportation before the railway increased fees. Then, how will the impact of increasing fees by 10 percent be like? There is no need to ask the elders. Thinking that this will be used to develop the entire national railway business can only be regarded as an ideal. Applying it to reality, I am afraid it will be counterproductive. To sum up, 1. Increasing freight rates not only runs counter to the purpose of relieving the suffering of merchants, but also affects the cost of goods, hinders the progress of foreign trade, merchants change to water transport, and car transport is robbed. According to the highest principle of developing industry and increasing the railway business, it is obviously inconsistent. It should be requested to cancel the order to increase freight rates by 10 percent. 2. Since the name of responsible transportation is responsible transportation, then all procedures such as car dispatching, car delays, and custody are the responsibility of the railway. Why should they be listed as miscellaneous fees, causing the end of car staff making things difficult and demanding and covering the suspicion of layers of exploitation? Should be asked to consider removing them. 3. The purpose of priority and highest priority is to cleverly obtain superior freight rates. The result will inevitably lead to the stagnation of ordinary freight and force it to compete for priority. Therefore, the so-called car dispatching, detention, and change fees are collected. This kind of chain reaction plan is really the source of greed. It should be requested to cancel it. 4. Before the responsible transportation, the storage period after the goods arrived at the station was six days. After the implementation of responsible transportation, it was stipulated that the goods must be picked up within six office hours. In fact, merchants cannot handle it at all, and the treatment is also very unfair. It should be requested to restore the old example.</p>

<p>Preparations for the Shanghai-Guangdong air route have been underway for two years. Due to the situation, the project has been intermittent, so it has not yet been implemented. Now, the China National Aviation Corporation is determined to complete the line in the shortest possible time, so it has been making vigorous progress in recent days. The various stations along the route, such as Shantou, Xiamen, and Ningbo, are convenient to plan because they already have airport facilities.

<h3 id="e117">Recommendations from the Wenzhou-Chu Salt Affairs Improvement Association to Rectify the Ou Salt Sheds <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Wenzhou-Chu Salt Affairs Improvement Association of this city recently telegraphed the Transportation Office, advocating for the reorganization of the Ou sheds. The original text is as follows: "We have recently received a letter from our members Chen Shu and others, stating that the corruption in Wenzhou-Chu salt affairs is the worst in Zhejiang Province. The root cause lies in the malpractices of salt merchants over the past four years. Officials and merchants collude, leading to skyrocketing salt prices, causing immense distress to the people, who have nowhere to turn for redress. Fortunately, the contracting system has been abolished, and freedom has been granted. All the residual evils left over from the contracting period should be thoroughly eradicated. Upon investigation, various salt farms in Wenzhou, such as North Salt Shuangsui and Ledong Lexi of Changlin Farm, had salt sheds established before the contracting system. The factory brokerage, commission, and spring labor costs collected by each shed were submitted to the office by the farm bureau for approval and collection, consistently without any changes. Since the implementation of the contracting system in Wenzhou-Chu, although the old salt sheds nominally continued to operate, they were, in reality, controlled by the contractors everywhere, leading to the closure of sheds run by honest and weak individuals, while cunning individuals colluded with the contractors. As a result, the contractors converted the old sheds into public offices, bribed the authorities to collect salt, increased factory brokerage commissions, and arbitrarily imposed various fees such as canopy charges. Depressing purchase prices and selling at inflated prices has become a common practice among the factories, and North Salt factories even engage in selling at reduced prices. All these malpractices originated from the contracting system, and a thorough investigation would immediately reveal the truth. Recently, with the abolition of the contracting system, the salt collection offices established by the contractors have been submitting applications to change their names to salt factories, while maintaining the same old practices. This indicates that although the contractors are gone, their residual evils remain. We are specially writing to this association, requesting that you forward this to the department for review, bestow upon us the favor of reorganization, and strictly enforce prohibitions." The association convened a meeting on the solar day of this month to discuss the matter. Everyone agreed that the points raised by member Chen were indeed factual and urgently needed reform. Consequently, the following resolution was adopted and submitted to your esteemed office: "That all factory owners and brokers in Wenzhou, and all fees, be uniformly changed back to the rules that were in place before the implementation of the contracting system. Those that were already established in the past should be thoroughly reorganized, and those that are now requesting to change should be strictly prohibited. As for the various fees arbitrarily collected by Wang merchants, please follow the Ministry's telegram and implement prohibition rules to handle them separately. The bad habit of government offices in our country is often to shelve orders from superiors as the only way to solve difficult problems. Over time, various parties have treated it as the only way to handle major cases, delaying progress and turning them into pending cases, leading to the failure of laws and regulations and the unbridled behavior of evildoers. Now, fortunately, the Minister has the determination to reorganize salt affairs, and you, sir, have expressed the intention to thoroughly remove accumulated malpractices. Swift and decisive action is in your hands. Correcting past mistakes and anticipating expectations are within reach. We believe that a wise man like you will thoroughly investigate and implement laws and regulations, eliminate abuses, and promote benefits, to satisfy the longings of the people of both Wenzhou and Chu.

<h3 id="e118">The Xiang Sheng Iron Factory Dispute May Be Resolved <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Since the incident a few days ago at the British-owned Xiang Sheng Iron Factory in Pudong, where some workers assaulted the factory manager, Mr. Krektow, and four Western administrators, the factory has been unable to maintain operations and has announced a shutdown pending resolution. Two days ago, representatives from Party and government agencies were dispatched to investigate. The factory stated that it would only resume operations if two demands were met, but since these matters were important, Zhou Lianze, an official from the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Wang Gang, an official from the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, accepted the demands and took them back for review. It is now understood that the Party and government sides believe that only a few bad elements were involved in the recent riot, and that the majority of the workers should not suffer unexpected losses. Therefore, after reviewing the two proposed solutions, they will meet again today with Zhang Linhua, a representative from the Fifth District Shipbuilding Workers' Union, at the office of Mr. Bengsi (transliteration), the chief foreman of the factory, located at 150 Broadway Road, to discuss a resolution. Thus, the labor unrest may not be prolonged.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Strike Committee of the Qiu Xin Factory Will Convene a General Meeting of Members Today <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>To Discuss the Floating Dock Project</p>
<p>The Qiu Xin Factory in Nanshi recently caused a strike due to the deduction of wages from workers on outside assignments and the dismissal of twelve workers. All work in various departments was completely halted yesterday, and the workers' resolve was particularly firm. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Today: After the Qiu Xin Factory dismissed workers and a strike occurred, all work came to a standstill. However, the Public Works Bureau had commissioned the Qiu Xin Factory to build a floating dock, as this project is an important segment of the Jiang-Zhe border route and is urgently needed for completion. Therefore, yesterday, Xue Cixin, the section chief of the Third Section of the Public Works Bureau, specially consulted with the labor union. It is reported that the labor union considers the matter significant and has scheduled a general meeting of all members for 2:00 PM today to discuss it.</p>
<p>Union Committee's Statement: According to Wang Chengzong, a standing committee member of the union, speaking to a reporter from the Da Gong She, the factory oppressed workers for no reason, deducted fixed transportation fees, dismissed a large number of workers, and refused Party and government mediation. Therefore, they were forced to reluctantly go on strike. All the workers in the factory are determined to fight to the death and will continue until their goals are achieved. They vowed not to return to work until their goals are achieved. Regarding the Public Works Bureau's floating dock, which is related to road administration and is quite important, it is regrettable that it is affected by the strike. However, it would be very difficult to undermine the strike as a result. Therefore, they are not in a position to accept it at this time and will convene a general meeting of members tomorrow (i.e., today) to discuss and decide based on the collective opinion.</p>

<p>Opposing Capitalist Oppression</p>
<p>A Notice Urges Workers to Unite</p>
<p>The East Asia Jute Bag Factory on Robison Road in West Shanghai is a Japanese-owned enterprise, divided into more than ten departments, including hemp beating, fine yarn, and bobbins. It employs approximately 1,200 male and female Chinese workers. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, it suspended operations for more than two months and resumed work on April 20th. Immediately after, all worker benefits, such as bonuses, monthly awards, and maternity pay for female workers, were completely canceled. Furthermore, more than twenty workers with higher wages, such as Jiao Yanlin, Chen Zhaomei, and Wang Yunqi, were dismissed, and investigators were hired to monitor the workers' actions. Because the workers could not bear the oppression, they decided to unite. More than fifty people, including Shen Bingnan and Xu Zuoliang, jointly submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters to organize a labor union. The Municipal Party Headquarters has now approved the request and issued permit number 72, authorizing them to prepare for the union, to be named the Third District Jute Workers' Union. The union has leased space at 26 Huaxing Lane, Robison Road, to begin registration and has issued a notice to workers stating:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Relief Plan for Unemployed Workers <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Original Text of the Second Outline: Welfare for Workers</p>
<p>The issue of unemployed workers in this city has long been a concern for all sectors of society. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has drafted a draft relief plan for unemployed workers, which has been reviewed by the bureau's third consultation meeting and then submitted for further review to ensure prudence. It is understood that the plan is very detailed and divided into four main outlines. The second outline is excerpted below:</p>
<p>The Unemployment Problem: The unemployment problem has become the most serious and intractable social problem in the world today. According to the latest statistics from the International Labour Office, in April of this year, the number of unemployed workers in the United Kingdom was 2,204,740; in Germany, 6,034,100; in France, 347,446; in Italy, 1,053,016; in Japan, 485,290; and in the United States, the number of unemployed union members alone reached 184,000. Due to China's industrial backwardness and the collapse of the rural economy, the number of unemployed and jobless people cannot be estimated. Even in this city, there are no accurate statistics to rely on. According to the results of the bureau's trial unemployment statistics in 1929, the number of unemployed union members in the city accounted for 6.45% of the total number of members. In recent years, industry has become increasingly depressed, and it has been affected by the January 28th Shanghai Incident. The labor unrest is more serious than it was when the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai in 1927. The unemployment problem is a comprehensive economic problem that cannot be solved locally. From a proactive perspective, developing the national industry is a more thorough solution. However, the development of a country's industry must have sufficient conditions and cannot be achieved overnight. The central government has long formulated meticulous industrial and commercial plans for our country. Since this draft focuses on providing relief to unemployed workers in this city, it should take into account the unemployment situation of workers in this city and, within the scope of the bureau's authority, select those measures that can be implemented effectively within a reasonable period and to a reasonable extent.</p>
<p>Relief Outline: Specific plans are proposed, divided into the main points of eliminating labor-capital disputes, organizing welfare projects for workers, promoting the rural economy, and developing industries. Passive measures to treat the symptoms and proactive construction plans are listed together. Those matters that involve national affairs, such as tariffs, immigration, and reclamation, will be suggested to the National Government at any time and will not be listed separately. However, for the implementation of the plan to provide relief to unemployed workers, both financial and human resources are indispensable. When this draft was first drafted, there were no corresponding regulations for the supply of financial and human resources, so the scope of relief, although determined, lists the main points of relief and the outlines of the measures. For matters that are within the responsibilities of the responsible departments, such as the elimination of labor unrest, the guidance of labor union facilities and the labor movement, the inspection of factories, the establishment of workers' savings associations, labor schools, clubs, and consumer cooperatives in various factories, and the improvement of agricultural affairs, the encouragement of side businesses, the promotion of domestic goods, the guidance of commodity sales, and the implementation of scientific management, the responsibility lies with labor and capital, while the bureau takes a supporting and supervisory position. It is not difficult to order the responsible departments to implement them effectively in order. Those that require additional special funds to be raised will be determined by the director based on their importance and urgency, and implemented in order. Below is the original text of the second outline for organizing welfare projects for workers.</p>
<p>Welfare Projects for Workers: Organizing welfare projects for workers, such as employment agencies, small-scale craft lending offices, workers' savings associations, and raising unemployment relief funds, are all relief measures after unemployment. The purpose of the other projects is to improve workers' knowledge and skills, improve workers' living conditions, and thus coordinate labor and capital, develop industry, and prevent unemployment. The following welfare projects for workers, from the first to the ninth, are the first step of work, are important, and have the possibility of being organized, and should be organized immediately. Items ten through twenty-one are the second step of work and should be organized when sufficient funds are raised or when there is a sufficient opportunity.</p>
<p>Preliminary Work: (A) First Step of Work (To be Organized Immediately) (1) Organize an Unemployment Research Committee to study unemployment and explore relief measures and implementation. (2) Organize a Municipal Employment Agency. (Explanation) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has now promulgated temporary measures for employment agencies, and this city should comply with them to fulfill its responsibility to adjust the supply and demand of labor. (Measures) Draft the articles of association for the Municipal Employment Agency of this city in accordance with the temporary measures for employment agencies promulgated by the Ministry, and prepare a budget and submit it to the Municipal Government for approval. (3) Organize a Small-Scale Craft Lending Office (Explanation) If workers in bamboo ware, rattan ware, and other crafts can be loaned funds to purchase materials when they are unemployed, they can make them themselves. Not only will their skills not be wasted, but they can also earn a living from it. (Measures) Draft the articles of association for the Small-Scale Craft Lending Office, prepare a budget, and submit it to the Municipal Government for approval. Start with a trial in one area, and expand it after it is successful. (4) Supervise factories to establish workers' savings associations. (Explanation) The central government has now promulgated temporary measures for workers' savings, and this city should comply with them and supervise factories to establish workers' savings associations to handle workers' savings matters. This project is run by the factories themselves, and the bureau fulfills its supervisory duty. (Measures) Draft the temporary measures for workers' savings and the detailed rules for implementation in this city, and supervise factories to establish workers' savings associations. (5) Supervise factories to establish labor schools or labor classes. (Explanation) Labor education is divided into three types: literacy training, civic training, and vocational training, to increase workers' knowledge and skills and improve their work efficiency. The two departments of industrial and educational education have jointly formulated an outline of implementation measures for labor education, stipulating that factories, companies, shops, etc., should establish labor schools or labor classes. This project can be jointly handled with the Education Bureau. (Measures) Draft the outline of implementation measures for labor education with the Education Bureau and the detailed rules for implementation in this city, and supervise factories, etc., to establish labor schools or labor classes. (6) Supervise factories to establish staff clubs. (Explanation) The purpose of clubs is to promote noble entertainment and improve the lives of staff and workers. Too few factories have staff clubs, so they should be supervised to establish them universally in accordance with the general outline of the industrial and commercial staff club plan promulgated by the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce. (Measures) Draft the detailed rules for the implementation of the general outline of the industrial and commercial staff club plan in this city, and supervise factories to establish staff clubs. (7) Supervise labor unions to establish consumer cooperatives. (Explanation) The organization of consumer cooperatives is based on the spirit of equality and mutual assistance, pooling funds, and supplying the necessities of life in the most economical way in order to improve living conditions. Labor unions or factories should establish or assist in establishing them in accordance with the law. (Measures) The temporary general rules for consumer cooperatives in this city have already been promulgated, and labor unions should now be supervised to establish consumer cooperatives. (8) Supervise factories to organize other welfare projects for workers. (Explanation) For example, factories that employ female workers should set up childcare facilities, and those that usually employ more than 300 workers should set up medical rooms, etc. (Measures) Send personnel to investigate the situation in various factories and supervise or persuade them to organize within a possible scope. (9) Investigate the welfare projects for workers that have already been organized in this city. (Explanation) How many welfare projects for workers have been organized by labor unions, factories, or public offices in this city, and what is their content? It is not yet known in detail and should be investigated first before supervision and guidance can be carried out. (Measures) Send personnel to investigate and supervise the registration.</p>
<p>Second Step of Work: (B) Second Step of Work (To be Organized When the Opportunity Arises) (10) Raise funds to build labor housing (for families). (11) Raise funds to build labor dormitories (for singles). (12) Raise funds to build labor canteens. (13) Raise funds to build municipal labor clubs. (From items 10 to 13, these are welfare projects organized by the government for workers in small workshops and occupational workers, such as construction workers, dock workers, and rickshaw pullers.) (14) Raise funds to build labor childcare facilities. (15) Raise funds to build labor kindergartens. (16) Raise funds to build labor schools. (From items 14 to 16, these are welfare projects to reduce the burden on workers and educate labor children.) (17) Raise funds to build a labor insurance company. (18) Prepare to add labor hospitals. (19) Raise funds to build labor cemeteries. (20) Raise unemployment relief funds. (21) Organize other welfare projects for workers.</p>

<p>Wen Hongen, the newly appointed director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has been reviewing all case files submitted by various sections, departments, and teams since taking office a few days ago and has completed the sequential deployment. He has not yet had time to deal with the personnel rosters, uniforms, and military equipment of the various district offices under his jurisdiction. Therefore, Wen ordered Chief Inspector Gong Xicheng yesterday to dispatch personnel to inspect them. It is understood that Gong has dispatched inspectors Deng Qiying, Yu Zhi Kui, and An Xi Kai, along with sixteen others, to inspect the various district offices in Nanshi and Zhabei and has set a deadline of three days for completion and submission of a report.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Strictly Prohibit Military Personnel from Riding Trains Without Tickets <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have previously been ordered by the Ministry of Railways to open and consult the Ministry of Military Administration to instruct their subordinate troops to strictly prohibit and ban military personnel from riding trains without tickets. However, recently, military personnel have frequently been riding trains without tickets at various stations on the two railways and forcibly occupying first and second-class seats. When the military police accompanying the train reasoned with them, disputes often arose. Therefore, the Ministry specially consulted the Ministry of Military Administration to issue another order strictly prohibiting this. If military personnel need to travel by train on official business, they must be issued a Class A military travel permit by the Ministry and present it to the station to exchange for a ticket before they can board the train. In the future, if military personnel attempt to board the train without a ticket, the military police accompanying the train should detain them and hand them over to the responsible officer for severe punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Measures for Punishing Loafers at Docks <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>At the wharves in this city, there are often unemployed vagrants who disturb travelers. The Public Security, Public Utilities, and Social Affairs Bureaus specially consulted on four measures for punishment the other day, as follows: 1. Loafers arrested by the wharf management of the Public Utilities Bureau in South Shanghai will be the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau to escort to the vagrant work-study center for accommodation. 2. The expenses for the aforementioned loafers' food and clothing at the center will be the responsibility of the Public Utilities Bureau to raise. 3. The procedures for detaining and sending wharf loafers will be determined separately by the Public Security and Public Utilities Bureaus. 4. The vagrant work-study center should quickly find ways to expand its buildings and increase the number of people it can accommodate.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Impersonating the Public Works Department Inspector and Committing Fraud <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Lei Wenkui Previously Committed Crimes in the Chinese Area</p>
<p>Xie Wanfang, a Chinese detective of the Yulin Road police station, previously apprehended three individuals: Ye Fangyan from Hangzhou, Cheng Fengxiang from Tongzhou, and Li Changyou from Ningbo. They were impersonating inspectors from the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, extorting money from Liu Jinyou and others at 233 Taopeng Road by claiming that the construction of wooden sheds on the rooftop and other violations were not allowed. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, where they confessed that their leader was Lei Wenkui from Nanxiang. As a result, they were sentenced to imprisonment. Recently, Detective Xie, who handled the case, learned that the criminal Lei was hiding at No. 5 Huasheng Road in the French Concession. He and a Western detective, along with French Concession police officers, secretly went there at 1:15 PM, arrested Lei, and three accomplices, Wan Aru and Dong Bin from Ningbo. They seized one pistol, one hundred bullets, several badges, and a box of cards. A pair of handcuffs were found near Dong. Lei and Wan claimed that the pistol was bought from Wang Fuxiang, a native of Jiangbei, who lived at 999 Donghan Bili Road in the Public Concession. The detectives then arrested Wang and brought him back to the police station for detention. The next morning, they were escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, recounted the previous events, stating that Lei's card was printed with "Lei Wenbiao." He claimed that Lei had previously committed similar fraud cases in the Chinese area and had been punished, so he changed the "biao" character. The gun, bullets, and other evidence were presented for inspection. Lei Wenkui had committed numerous fraud cases in Nanshi, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau should transfer him. He claimed he had not committed any crimes in the Concession. When questioned, Lei Wenkui confessed that he had known Ye Fangyan for many years and had committed crimes with Ye and others in Nanshi. He was arrested and sentenced. He was released from prison on March 11th of this year and, unable to find a livelihood, planned to commit similar illegal acts, impersonating inspectors from the Public Security Bureau. That is why he had the badges and cards. He had now obtained a position as an inspector in the Fisheries Administration Bureau and needed a pistol for self-defense on the ship in the Huangpu River, so he asked Wang Aru to buy one from Wang Fuxiang. Wan was a friend of Ye Fangyan and stayed with him. Wan Aru confessed that Lei asked him to buy the pistol for protection while working on the ship, which was true. Wang Fuxiang confessed that Wan Aru came to him, showed Lei's card, and he bought the pistol from a man named Meng. Dong Bin also confessed that he was an inspector on the Fisheries Administration Bureau's ship and that the handcuffs were for arresting pirates. His other statements were evasive. Judge Lin reviewed the confessions and ordered all defendants to be detained and remanded for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<p>Manchurian Railway Business</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident last year, the Japanese have progressed from economic and cultural aggression to acts of occupation. However, the pioneers of this process are still economic and cultural activities, and the company responsible for them is the South Manchuria Railway Company (Mantetsu). We all know that the Japanese have established four main organs in the three northeastern provinces: the Kwantung Army Headquarters, which manages military affairs; the Kwantung Government-General, which manages civil administration; the Consulate, which manages foreign affairs; and Mantetsu, which manages economic and cultural enterprises. Before the September 18th Incident, the mask had not yet been fully removed, so the military, civil, and diplomatic aspects of the four organs still maintained a pretense of cordiality. Only Mantetsu, using commercial operations as a shield, openly proceeded, infiltrating all subsidiary enterprises outside the railway. Many Chinese people were shocked but perhaps unable to fully understand. Time has passed, and it has been a year since the incident. Looking back at the pain of lost territory and the suffering of displacement, we must study it even more carefully. Here, we selectively describe the Manchurian Railway's business to inform the Chinese people of what to be wary of.</p>
<p>The emergence of the Manchurian Railway's business originated from Japan's acquisition of the South Manchuria Railway rights. The Japanese obtained it after the Russo-Japanese War, succeeding the South Manchuria section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and also made agreements regarding the Andong-Fengtian Railway and the connecting of Jilin-Changchun Railway with Korea, and the construction of a branch line in Yingkou.</p>
<p>Originally, although the Japanese had set foot in South Manchuria and Andong, there were corresponding time limits. When Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, he proposed the Twenty-One Demands, changing the South Manchuria and Andong Railways to ninety-nine years, and proposing to revise the Jilin-Heilongjiang agreement. Although the Twenty-One Demands were not recognized by us, the urgency of Japan's intentions is evident. Furthermore, in 1913, there was a proposal to build five railways using Japanese loans: the Sipingjie-Taonan Railway (220 miles), the Kaiyuan-Hailong Railway (123 miles), the Taonan branch of the Changchun line of Jilin-Changchun Railway (180 miles), the Jilin-Hailong Railway (112 miles). Although the Chang-Tao and Ji-Hai Railways could borrow foreign funds, they first had to obtain Japan's consent, revealing their intention to annex.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Manchurian Railway led to the creation of the South Manchuria Railway Company. Since the South Manchuria Railway Company was the source of economic and cultural strategies, it devoted itself to managing the South Manchuria Railway, gradually extending to other related railways in the Northeast provinces and other subsidiary enterprises. Since this article focuses specifically on the Manchurian Railway, we will leave aside Japan's overall plan for all railways in Manchuria and Mongolia and focus on those related to the Manchurian Railway. In fact, all of Japan's overall plans that have been realized can be said to be related to the Manchurian Railway.</p>
<p>In addition to those related to Japan, other railways in the Northeast provinces include the Shenyang-Haikou Railway (state-owned), the Jilin-Hailong Railway (officially and privately operated), the Harbin-Hailun Railway (officially and privately operated), the Qiqihar-Kesha Railway (officially and privately operated), the Hulin-Gangkao Railway (privately operated), the Kaiyuan-Fengcheng Railway (privately operated), the Qiqihar-Angxi Railway (officially and privately operated), the Datong-Tongliao Railway (branch of the Beining Railway), the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Railway (branch of the Beining Railway), the Xinmin-Shenyang section of the Beining Railway (state-owned), the Chinese Eastern Railway (Sino-Russian joint venture), the Muling Railway (Sino-Russian joint venture), and the Beining Railway (British loan). Among these, 24.2% were self-operated, 37% were related to British and Russian interests, and 38.7% were related to Japan. Even the South Manchuria Railway alone far surpasses other railways. The South Manchuria Railway transported 15.96 million tons of goods last year, while all the others combined transported only 18 million tons, accounting for 89%. In addition, the South Manchuria Railway transported 10.576 million passengers, while the other ten railways combined transported only 16.276 million passengers, with a slightly smaller difference, accounting for 65%. If we add other railways related to Japan, the strength of its influence would be immeasurable. The South Manchuria Railway Company was founded in 1906, established by the Japanese after obtaining the right to inherit the Changchun-Dalian section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. According to the original agreement, the Chinese Eastern Railway was based on the loan agreement of the 26th year of the Guangxu reign, with the railway being managed by Daosheng. Therefore, the contract included 5 million taels of silver in capital from the Chinese government. After eighty years, all assets would be returned to China without compensation, and China could redeem them with investment after sixteen years. In fact, it was merely a commercial agreement for a railway loan, but the Japanese obtained it and aggressively expanded their ambitions, actively proceeding. Our government also failed to consider sovereignty and impose restrictions, allowing it to grow out of control and become the vanguard of aggression. The capital of the Manchurian Railway was 200 million Japanese yen, with the Japanese government using railway and mining assets as half of the capital, and the remaining half being raised as commercial shares in Japan. It was moved from Tokyo to Dalian and began operations on April 1, 1907. Twelve years later, the share capital was expanded to 440 million yen, with government and commercial shares each accounting for half, each with 4.4 million shares. It operated the 437.5-mile Dalian-Changchun section, the 31.6-mile branch line from Zhoushuizi to Lushun, the 3.6-mile branch line from Dafangshen to Liushutun, the 13.4-mile branch line from Dashiqiao to Yingkou, the 9.7-mile branch line from Yantai to Yantai Mine, the 3.8-mile Fushun line, and the 170.9-mile Andong line, totaling 670.5 miles. Its strategic location and connections allowed it to control the transportation of Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Outside the South Manchuria Railway, the Sipingjie-Taonan Railway branch line reached Tongliao, totaling 264.8 miles. The Manchurian Railway invested 32 million yuan, and the Zhengjin Bank invested 5 million yuan. It was difficult for it to become China's state-owned railway, and due to the loan relationship, everything was almost controlled by the Japanese. The three departments of general affairs, engineering, and transportation were also headed by Japanese directors, and the vehicles used were mostly leased from the South Manchuria Railway, demonstrating the Manchurian Railway's influence.</p>
<p>The Taonan-Angxi Railway was 224.0 miles long. Because of its important location in northern Manchuria, the Japanese intentionally planned to seize it. This railway was nominally contracted by the East Asia Company, a Sino-Japanese joint venture, but the capital actually came from the Manchurian Railway's advance payment, totaling 18 million Japanese yen. The contract stipulated that the loan should be repaid upon completion. If it was not repaid within six months, it would be converted into a loan. Later, we were unable to repay the loan, so it was converted into a loan agreement, and the Manchurian Railway appointed four directors.</p>
<p>The Jilin-Changchun Railway was 127 miles long. In the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign, a loan agreement was negotiated, allowing the Japanese to invest half of the capital. The Manchurian Railway managed it during the 30-year loan period. Thus, the railway rights fell into Japanese hands. It was nominally state-owned, but in reality, it was all controlled by the Manchurian Railway. The administrative organization even included a so-called Manchurian Railway representative, who operated alongside the director. In addition, the three departments of transportation, engineering, and accounting were all headed by Japanese personnel.</p>
<p>The Jilin-Dunhua Railway, which extended 365 Chinese miles further east, would reach Huning in Korea and eventually Qingjin Port. Therefore, it could also be considered a section of the Jilin-Korea Railway. The construction contract was also contracted by the Manchurian Railway in 1925 for 24 million Japanese yen. The Jilin-Korea Railway was most closely related to Northeast defense and was strongly opposed by the people. However, once it reached Dunhua, it could easily connect to Huning, and there was also the Tianbao Mountain-Tumen River Railway, which connected to the Korean Huning Railway at Sanfeng across the river. The Tianbao Mountain-Tumen River Railway was managed by another company with a capital of 4 million Japanese yen, half from the Jilin provincial government and half from the Oriental Colonization Company, but the actual power was again in the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The Wengcheng Railway was one of the light railways in the three northeastern provinces, 124,000 meters long, with a capital of 570,000. The Manchurian Railway held 70% of the shares, and the Benxi Lake Coal Mine held 30%, which was also within the sphere of influence of the Manchurian Railway. In addition, the Jinfu Railway, within the Japanese leased territory of the Jinzhou Peninsula, was 102 kilometers long, practically a Japanese railway.</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway's business, in addition to railways, encompassed everything in detail. In the economic sphere, it included locomotive factories, ships, harbors, marine products, mining, iron smelting, postal services, and telecommunications. In culture, it had primary, secondary, specialized schools, and libraries. Furthermore, there were central research institutes, geological survey institutes, scientific research institutes, agricultural experiment stations, veterinary research institutes, and the Manchu-Mongolian Resources Museum. Its various investments had reached over 67.175 million yuan the previous year. Among minerals, the Fushun Coal Mine was the largest, with reserves of 1 billion tons, producing 17,000 tons of coal per day, with an investment of 130 million Japanese yen. The mining area was one li long and four li wide. The Yantai Kuanchengzi Coal Mine was also directly managed by the Manchurian Railway, and there were also indirect investments. Its iron manufacturing was the Anshan Ironworks, located at Anshan Station, with three British-German-style iron-smelting furnaces, producing 1,200 tons per day. It also had ore-dressing and iron-burning equipment, generating 26,000 kilowatts of electricity. In addition, it was equipped with affiliated sulfuric acid-ammonia plants, coal tar distillation plants, wood alcohol plants, naphthalene plants, sulfuric acid plants, and brick factories. Japan was short of steel, so the Manchurian Railway spared no effort in managing it, using it as an external treasury.</p>
<p>The harbor and maritime department spent 69 million Japanese yen annually, and the shipping assets spent 4 million Japanese yen annually, mainly for managing and developing Dalian Bay. It built a 4,100-meter breakwater that could accommodate 30 large ships of 230,000 tons, making it the best harbor in East Asia. In addition, the ports of Gan Jingzi, Lushun, and Yingkou were also managed by the Manchurian Railway due to their geographical advantages. However, in terms of shipping, it was transferred to the Dalian Steamship Company after 1922. The factories directly managed by the Manchurian Railway were roughly as described above, including machinery, power generation, oil refining, gunpowder, gas, and raw material manufacturing such as sulfuric acid. It had almost everything, and its indirect investments in Japanese factories in the Northeast provinces were too numerous to mention. Roughly speaking, it was involved in glass, wool weaving, sugar making, medicine, lumbering, steamships, engineering, insurance, trust companies, and exchanges, but it is impossible to list them all in detail.</p>
<p>In terms of cultural enterprises, the Manchurian Railway ran a medical university, various Manchurian education specialized schools, South Manchurian Institute of Technology, various middle schools, various girls' high schools, various vocational schools, various supplementary schools, kindergartens, libraries in Dalian and Fengtian, and other libraries and kindergartens, totaling more than 50. There were 398 primary schools, 86 middle schools, and 5 specialized schools or higher, and its research and propaganda publications numbered nearly ten thousand.</p>
<p>Local facilities were also under the concession rights of the Manchurian Railway. The management of city streets in Dalian, roads, bridges, embankments, parks, markets, slaughterhouses, hospitals, sanatoriums, firefighting, sheep breeding, chicken farming, milk, etc., were all managed by it. The maintenance costs came from the people's city taxes, supplemented by the Manchurian Railway.

<h3 id="e128">Appeal of Russian Beggar's Death Case Scheduled for Hearing <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The case of Russian beggar Georgi Ladi Kiv, who died in the Second Special District Court detention center in the French Concession on June 19th of this year, was initiated by the police department based on a report from the deceased's brother, Simon Graiteki, who claimed that his brother was beaten to death by the detention center staff. After investigation, the case was transferred to the Second Special Court for prosecution, accusing detention center director Xu Chongwen, medical officer Yu Minggao, and staff member Zhou Zongxiang of abandonment and causing injury. The trial was conducted by Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu, who also invited renowned British and French doctors, Villiers Smith, to join the court's forensic doctor, Wei Ligong, to re-examine the body. The result determined that the death was due to illness and there were no injuries. A verdict of not guilty was issued for the three defendants, Xu, Yu, and Zhou. The police department expressed dissatisfaction with the original verdict and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The original court, upon receiving the appeal, submitted the case file to the Third Branch of the High Court for review. Details of the case and the original verdict have been disclosed in this newspaper. It is now learned that after receiving the case file and the supplementary appeal brief from the police department, the Third Branch of the High Court has assigned Judge Guo Dezhang of the Criminal Court to handle the case. Judge Guo has begun reviewing the entire case file and is reportedly scheduled to summon witnesses for a hearing on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Two Nephews Accuse Uncle of Embezzling Funds <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Amounting to No Less Than Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars</p>
<p>Xu Yuchen, a shareholder of Hengtong Qianzhuang on Beijing Road, is the second son of Xu Yongyi, a palace guard who was one of the three gentlemen executed by order of Empress Dowager Cixi during the Boxer Rebellion. Xu had three sons: the eldest, Shiming; the second, Shizhong (i.e., Yuchen); and the youngest, Shiheng. After the palace guard was martyred, his wife, Madam Cha, led the family south and resided in Shanghai. In 1905, Xu Yongfu, the brother of the palace guard, divided his brother's estate into four portions. The sons of the eldest son, Shiming, Wenrong, and the sons of the youngest son, Shiheng, Wenxin, each received one portion. Yuchen also received one portion, and the remaining portion was set aside as public property, to be managed by Yuchen since Shiming and Shiheng were deceased, and Wenrong and Wenxin were still young. This has been the case for 28 years. The annual income from pawnshops and land rentals in their hometown of Haiyan and Shanghai is considerable. Madam Cha also used public funds for social expenses. After Madam Cha's death in 1923, the annual expenses decreased. Since Yuchen has been managing the funds and has not provided an accounting, Wenrong and Wenxin have no knowledge of the amount of accumulated public funds. They have repeatedly requested that their uncle provide an accounting, but Yuchen, claiming his seniority, refuses to let his nephews inquire. Now that Wenrong and others have grown up and established the Tiancheng Yarn Company on Avenue Edward VII, they are deeply dissatisfied with their uncle's embezzlement of public property. In the summer, they hired lawyer Ersen to file a petition with the First Special District Court, requesting the preservation of evidence and ordering Xu Yuchen to submit all income and expenditure records from 1923 to 1931 for review. Although the court ruled that he should provide the accounting, Yuchen consistently refused, leading the two nephews to formally sue him. Judge Yang Peng concluded the trial, recognizing the plaintiffs' request as legitimate and ruling that the defendant should submit all accounting records and immediately declare provisional execution. The defendant initially ignored the ruling, then filed an appeal. Finally, as the court's execution became increasingly urgent and police officers were repeatedly dispatched to Hengtong Qianzhuang and his residence at 14 Singapore Road to arrest him, he was able to temporarily stall, but it was difficult to delay indefinitely. At the end of last month, after having an accountant review the accounting books, he complied with the ruling and submitted them, while also withdrawing the appeal. Wenrong and others then began auditing the accounts, and the results revealed numerous acts of embezzlement, estimated to be no less than hundreds of thousands of dollars. To maintain the common interest, they again hired lawyer Ersen to file a criminal private prosecution with the First Special District Court, requesting that the defendant Xu Yuchen be arrested and tried in accordance with Article 356 of the Criminal Law. The court has already approved the issuance of a summons for the defendant and has scheduled a hearing within days. It is reported that Xu Yuchen is over sixty years old and has been suffering from old age and illness. Upon receiving the court summons, he immediately entrusted lawyers Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaowu, and Zhang Jiahui to appear in court to defend him.</p>
<h3 id="e130">County Government Advises Merchants Not to Use "Flying Flowers" <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received a report from the County Farmers' Education Hall, stating that the local cloth of Pudong has always been famous, but in recent years, merchants have been adulterating it with "flying flowers," causing the cloth to be loose and fragile and easily damaged. If this continues, no one will buy it. Therefore, they requested a public announcement prohibiting the use of "flying flowers." The County Government considered that "flying flowers" had not been determined to be contraband and was therefore not in a position to prohibit it. Yesterday, it instructed the various Public Security Bureaus to advise merchants not to use "flying flowers" any further to maintain the reputation of local cloth.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Request for a Dance Denied, Dancer's Face Punched <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Tang Aifei Accuses Xue Juexian et al. of Assaulting and Humiliating Her in Public</p>
<p>Cantonese opera star Xue Juexian, accompanied by friends Feng Ruiting and others, went to the Xinxin Ballroom on Guizhou Road at 8:15 PM on September 3rd (Saturday) to dance. Xue suddenly had a conflict with dancer Tang Aifei at the ballroom. Feng immediately reached out and punched Tang in the left cheek, injuring her left eye. Tang then hired lawyer Qian Ying to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Xue and Feng of assault. The indictment stated that the plaintiff had been practicing dancing since childhood and had been working as a dancer at the Xinxin Ballroom for years. On the evening of September 3rd, the first and second defendants entered the ballroom to dance. It was early autumn, and there were many guests. At 8:15 PM, as the music began, the first defendant approached the plaintiff and asked her to dance, but she politely declined because she had a prior engagement with another guest. Unexpectedly, a moment later, the first defendant asked a waiter to summon the plaintiff to his table. As soon as she stood there, the second defendant stood up and said, "You have made my friend lose face. Today, my friend has ordered me to hit you." As he spoke, he punched the plaintiff's left eye, causing injury, swelling, and bruising. Witnesses on the scene included the plaintiff's sister, Tang Hongfei (also a dancer at the Xinxin Ballroom), and others. Although the plaintiff's profession is humble, her words and actions have always been extremely cautious. The first defendant, because the plaintiff refused to dance with him, harbored resentment and instigated the second defendant to assault and humiliate her in public, violating Article 293 and Article 324 of the Criminal Law. They should be severely punished, and all rights to file an ancillary civil lawsuit are reserved. Furthermore, the defendants are all residing in temporary lodgings (Room 69, Xinxin Hotel) and have no fixed address, so there is a risk of flight. In accordance with Articles 41 and 42 of the Criminal Procedure Law, they should be arrested as soon as possible. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special Court issued a summons, but the defendants did not appear. Xue Juexian hired lawyer Wu Chengyu to defend him, stating that Xue had gone to Hangzhou on business on the 8th and could not attend court. He also stated that Xue and others no longer resided at the Xinxin Hotel. Xue now lived at 92 Anle Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and Feng lived at 13 Hongfu Lane, North Henan Road. Future summons should be sent directly to their residences, and they would be able to attend court. The court then questioned Tang Aifei, who stated that she was 18 years old, from Guangdong, and a dancer at the Xinxin Ballroom. She briefly described what happened. Then, her sister, Tang Hongfei, and an English sailor, Sidaigu, who was present at the time, testified about Feng Ruiting's assault and humiliation of Tang Aifei. Since the defendants did not appear, Judge Liu ordered the case to be postponed for a week and the defendants to be summoned to court for further questioning.</p>

<p>Xie Liansheng Commits Assault and Is Sent to the Authorities</p>
<p>Shi Wenxiang, a 28-year-old Jiangsu native who is the head waiter at the Tianyi Chi bathhouse in the Ji畝地 area of the city, residing at 603 Marius Malephan, was approached several days ago by Xie Liansheng (nicknamed Xiaomai), a local gangster, who wanted to recommend a friend to Shi's bathhouse as a waiter. Shi declined, as he already had too many staff members, which made Xie Liansheng unhappy. At approximately 3:00 PM yesterday, Xie arrived with a hatchet and, seeing Shi lying on a couch, raised the hatchet and struck Shi's head twice, followed by four strikes on his body. Shi woke up in pain, bleeding profusely from deep wounds. Several colleagues rushed forward, restrained the assailant Xie Liansheng, seized the hatchet, and called the police, who detained him at the First Precinct of the Second District. The injured Shi was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Wang Guan, a 39-year-old woman from Ningbo, recently hired lawyer He Sui to file a criminal complaint with the Second Special Court against Yang Fuhai, also known as Yang Sijiu (52 years old), who resides at No. 9, Xiangyu Lane, Tianzhutang Street, and is the chief indigo officer at the Cheng Zhi Dye Store. The complaint alleges that Yang Fuhai committed acts of indecency, rape, and public indecency. The complaint states the following: "For indecent assault, rape, public indecency, and requesting lawful detention. The plaintiff came to Shanghai with her husband last year and rented a place at No. 38, Yuan'an Lane, Fangbang Bridge. Later, her husband went to Hebei to do business, and the plaintiff remained in Shanghai. Unfortunately, the Shanghai war broke out, and she faced financial difficulties. While trying to raise money, she met the defendant on the street. The plaintiff did not know him and ignored him. However, the defendant, driven by lust, used seductive tactics, falsely claiming to be acquainted with the plaintiff's husband and offering to help with her difficulties. From then on, he frequently visited. On April 16th of this year, the defendant, claiming to help raise money, invited the plaintiff to the Hubao Hotel in Baoyu Lane to meet some friends. However, when the plaintiff arrived at the hotel, the defendant opened room 11, falsely saying that his friends had not yet arrived and they had to wait. The defendant bought two catties of Shaoxing wine and forced the plaintiff to drink it. When the plaintiff refused, the defendant insisted. Unable to refuse, the plaintiff drank two cups. The wine caused her to faint and lose consciousness. After about an hour, Yang committed rape. The plaintiff, weakened by the alcohol, could not resist and was raped. There are torn pants and hotel records as evidence. Afterwards, Yang promised to provide support and said that he would marry the plaintiff soon. The plaintiff, considering what had happened, listened to him and stayed at the hotel waiting for the wedding. However, the defendant, seeing that he had achieved his aim, abandoned her, not only failing to provide daily necessities but also making the promised wedding distant. In this situation, the plaintiff could neither return to her husband's family nor stay at the hotel indefinitely, making her situation life threatening. She believes that the defendant first used deceptive tactics and violence to commit indecent assault and rape, and then abandoned her, disregarding human decency and acting like a beast. His actions violate Article 342, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, and she requests that the defendant be arrested and prosecuted according to law." The defendant was summoned the day before yesterday and arrived at the court represented by a lawyer. The defendant had not received a notice and claimed to be unaware of the plaintiff's accusations, requesting a postponement for another hearing. Judge Xiong briefly questioned the plaintiff and granted the postponement.</p>

<p>Recently, two individuals, Zhu Bingkui (also known as Gao Shun) and a Mr. Xu, who live in western Shanghai, have been posing as senior officials of various Shanghai courts, forging credentials, and swindling money.

The local court often receives inquiries from litigants about whether there are positions such as investigators. The court has no such position, and recently there was also the case of Bao Muxian and others excavating graves and defrauding three hundred yuan, which was reported. Therefore, the court has ordered the police to investigate and arrest them.</p>

After the Shanghai war, the association was not in charge of anyone, which led to a state of stagnation. The association's location has also moved from the city to the French Concession. Now the directors of the association, Lin Kecong, Wang Xiaoying, etc., believe that it is not appropriate to stop again at a time when the women's movement is surging. Therefore, they plan to reorganize it in the near future. At the same time, there are many unemployed women seeking help from the association, all of whom are asking for a way to find a job. However, there is a surplus of people now, and there is no way to settle them. Therefore, they plan to raise funds to build a women's factory after the association's affairs have developed, specifically to settle these women. On the one hand, it can increase production to meet the needs of society.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhu Gongquan, an engineer at the Wing On No. 3 Textile Factory on Maigen Road, has recently been suffering from insomnia and, following the doctor's advice, plans to take a long-term rest.

Yesterday, more than 250 representatives of the factory's employees held a meeting in the factory to bid farewell and presented him with a large silver cup and a silver bottle inscribed with "Deep Love and Respect," as well as a dissecting microscope. The factory employees also welcomed the new engineer, Mr. Li Xizhao, who had studied in the United States and had a deep understanding of academics, and had been working in the company's first factory. Both sides made very sincere speeches with a feeling of reluctance. After refreshments, they took a group photo. A warm farewell party ended with firecrackers and applause.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I read a true story in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on September 6th about the rent dispute in Xincheng Lane, which said that I was the adopted son of Shen Manyun, which is particularly surprising. I am over thirty years old and have never heard of being the adopted son of my late father. I am writing to you specifically, hoping that you will publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Sincerely, Shen Huantang. September 10th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: In the "Local News" section of your newspaper on the 11th, the report on the petition of the sauce industry workers' representatives has many discrepancies. Therefore, I am sending you a letter with the details of the petition in the hope that it will be corrected to match the facts. The conditions for protection requested by our representatives were established in the 19th year, not the 16th year. We requested that the Party Department order the capitalists to appoint representatives within a week to work with the workers to supervise the stores to fulfill the established conditions. Mr. Wang Man, the director of the Party Department's Public Training Division, thought it was reasonable and fully accepted it and promised to do his best to contact them. It was not after consideration that it was reviewed. Wishing you, the Chief Editor, well, Zhang Ru, Zhang Keqiang, Wu Taiting, Shen Jiabin, Shen Boqing, and Chu Yifeng jointly. September 12th.</p>

<h3 id="e162">A Speech Prepared for Receiving the League of Nations Investigation Team <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Recorded by Jing.</p>
<p>When the League of Nations investigation team first arrived in Shanghai, General Zhu Ziqiao originally prepared to entertain them and invited Old Man Xiang to participate. Old Man Xiang instructed them to prepare a speech and asked Mr. Hu Gangfu to announce it on his behalf at the time. Later, the proposal to entertain them was cancelled, so the prepared words remained until today. Here is a summary.</p>
<p>"The League of Nations investigation team has consistently upheld justice and has not been deceived by Japan's false propaganda. Therefore, we Chinese people's representatives are very willing to sincerely express our long-standing spirit of loving peace, and declare our future attitude of actively defending ourselves and resisting to the end.</p>
<p>China has always loved peace since ancient times. We not only hope to live in peace, but also are always prepared to die in peace. If you have ever browsed Chinese history books, you must know the custom of living cemeteries in the Six Dynasties. Many literati and scholars sang about this graveyard prepared in life. They even lived in that living cemetery, thinking it was open-minded, and calling themselves understanders. This custom is an ironclad proof that Chinese people still seek peace in death, let alone those who are still alive who would not seek peace? This view is indeed the common psychology of the Chinese people and their inherited spirit of peace. Since you have come to China for justice, please investigate the relics of the Shanghai-Songhu war! You must know that what was destroyed were Chinese shops, what was trampled on were Chinese farmlands, and more importantly, countless innocent Chinese old, young, women, and children were brutally killed by the Japanese formal army! Did you see this phenomenon when you passed through Japan? I will propose to preserve the destroyed battle traces in Zhabei and never rebuild them, as a memorial area, so that alliances for world peace, such as the League of Nations disarmament, can learn from it!</p>
<p>Thank you for your efforts for justice! We Chinese people will never beg you to take sides! I have already sacrificed for peace, and will seek guarantees for peace, and be loyal to peace and defend myself to the end!"</p>

<p>— Zhou Wu-ai</p>
<p>| Qingdao Returnee's Talk |</p>
<p>Verdant foliage forms a canopy, allowing fishermen from their floating boats to catch sight of the renewed joy after a long absence. A carpet of lush green, occasionally interspersed with a few wildflowers, covers the golden sands of the beach where seagulls circle and fly. From the boats, houses are not visible, only these layers of color. As the setting sun casts its glow, one might see the red light of the evening glow reflected from the mountaintops, bathing the scene above, as children frolic on the shore. This is Qingshan: a small village of two to three hundred households, nestled between the sea and the mountains. It is inhabited by wives left behind by their husbands' fishing lives, leading solitary existences, along with a small number of men engaged in trade and the elderly, infirm, and young. In Qingshan, there is no intellectual progress, nor is there reverence for ritual and propriety. All they possess is need. Driven by need, they work and live the same lives day after day.</p>
<p>However, sometimes needs are not fully met, leaving them unfulfilled. The husbands have gone to catch fish, in large or small boats, sailing in groups across the sea. They are gone for ten or eight days, even two or three months, leaving the young women behind. Therefore, driven by need, they have created something that other villages dare not do. They welcome and lodge unfamiliar men, if their husbands are not at home.</p>
<p>| Ah, Sister-in-law! Can I have a cup of tea? I'm so tired. A man with surging desires, seeing that there is no picture from a cigarette pack on the door of this house, will know that she is dreaming a lonely dream: he can go and flirt with her, for a price of two or three yuan.</p>
<p>They are very robust, with curvy breasts and hips, despite their bound feet. Although their children all have a father, his lineage is impossible to trace.</p>

<p>Bing Ding</p>
<p>| A Model for People |</p>
<p>In the past, people often used mandarin ducks to describe love, but in fact, the most prone to change in love are insects: insects are most able to sing, aren't they singing love songs? Insects are most able to dance, aren't they dancing? Insects are most able to mate, aren't they practicing "living together in love"? Insects are most able to fight, aren't they fighting for females? They even stay together for life in the skeleton of a sponge, never willing to part like swallows, like the "eternal companions in the same cave" produced in the Mediterranean. Where can people match their unchanging changes in love?</p>
<p>Zoologists say: Male insects also have testicles, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts in their bodies. Females also have ovaries, seminal receptacles, oviducts, mucus glands, and vaginas. The structure is very complete. So we often see flies carrying flies and dragonflies biting dragonflies in summer and autumn: if they did not know how to change love, first, they would not be so intimate; second, as foreigners say: two flies after three months, the offspring multiplied, would not have to circle the earth dozens of times. There is also the love of ants, which is at a certain time: at this time, everyone grows wings and dances in the air, then holds a wedding. At other times, they work peacefully, not like people who want to fall in love at any time.</p>
<p>The beauty of butterflies and ladybugs is a symbol of love. The male and female crickets follow each other, guarding a place, which can be said to be Liang Hong and Meng Guang among insects. Ticks and fleas spend all day talking about love and practicing dancing in bed. Cicadas, katydids, ground crickets, and bell crickets sing love songs day and night, even more enthusiastically than female students singing "Sister, I love you." Only mayflies and silkworms enjoy the least taste of love, and can be said to be the unfortunate ones in the insect world's river of love.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Who Is Qualified to Talk About Saving the Nation <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Da-ge</p>
<p>From airplanes flying in the sky to beggars filing lawsuits on the ground, everyone uses "XX to save the nation" as their slogan. To see how earnestly they are saving the nation, I decided to investigate them thoroughly, but I ultimately did not find a single person sincerely saving the nation.</p>
<p>Advising others to save the nation and saving the nation oneself are, of course, the duties of citizens. Why saving the nation requires waiting for others to advise is one question. Forming groups because of saving the nation and each saving their own nation is another question. Where to save the nation and where to start saving is the third question, which is especially important compared to the above.</p>
<p>I have learned about saving the nation's activities in the newspapers; I have also admired the figures saving the nation. The former is to increase titles, and the latter are all consumers of gasoline. How about giving you esteemed and hard-working figures saving the nation the phrase "save the nation with cars"?</p>
<p>Recently, what is presented to us in the newspapers in the same way as the cause of saving the nation: "industrial decline," "national unemployment,"... all rely on your aid. I very much hope that you can spare some of your strength to save the nation to relieve society.</p>
<p>Saving the nation is not just empty talk. Relying on a few car owners to run around will not save what is not saved. If society is not prosperous, individual economies will panic. If people cannot save themselves, how can they save the nation? If the current figures saving the nation do not pay attention to this point, who is qualified to talk about saving the nation?</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law! Open the door quickly! I'm holding two big watermelons, I really can't stand the sun." Someone was calling outside the door.</p>
<p>"Sorry, please wait a moment, I'll come open the door." Yifen Ruo replied from the window upstairs, and hurried downstairs.</p>
<p>In this moment, many thoughts in Commander Yuan's mind, like lightning, like a gust of wind, like summer clouds, arose in countless and very rapid changes. He didn't understand who was upstairs, and who was outside the door. Was Fenruo a widow in name or in fact? He pitied Fenruo, envied Fenruo, and loved Fenruo. He didn't know how to maintain his original central idea, and he didn't know how to deal with the current environment. In a daze, he couldn't help but open the door before Fenruo came downstairs.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's you?" Mr. Wang was so surprised that he dropped the two big watermelons he was holding on the ground, shattering them.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" Commander Yuan was inexplicable, and couldn't find a second sentence other than this question.</p>
<p>Fenruo had already come downstairs. Seeing that all the secrets were completely revealed in front of Mr. Wang, she didn't know what to do, but instead went to pick up the broken watermelons.</p>
<p>"Are you Commander Yuan?" Mr. Wang also calmed down a bit, looking carefully at Commander Yuan from head to toe twice, still not daring to be sure, so he asked again.</p>
<p>"I am Commander Yuan, are you the one selling watermelons?" Commander Yuan also asked.</p>
<p>"Come in quickly and talk!" Fenruo stopped picking up the broken watermelon, and pulled Mr. Wang inside, closing the door.</p>
<p>"Now the scheduled time for the completion ceremony of the monument has passed for an hour: I heard that the county magistrate and the chief of public security just went to the city to welcome the commander, but they came up empty, and they have returned, and are still waiting for the commander to attend the meeting to hold the ceremony." Mr. Wang faithfully reported, and while he spoke, he often scanned back and forth between Commander Yuan and Fenruo with his eyes, like a hunting dog, trying to detect some special meaning.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, Commander Yuan is her relative, | saying that she moved her lips upstairs | he came to see her illness by the way, in any case, please don't publicize it, this is my earnest request to you." Fenruo almost tearfully begged Mr. Wang to keep the secret.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law has instructed, I will definitely do as instructed, and I have also decided: but in any case, Commander Yuan should wait for at most half an hour, and must attend the meeting, because today's ceremony is extremely grand, and there are many guests who want to give speeches, if it is later, the time will be tight.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Wearing a Homespun Long Gown <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Wearing a homespun long gown was originally a common occurrence for us intellectuals. We cannot afford Western woolens and fine silks, and the price is also expensive (although it is slightly cheaper this year), so we have to wear a homespun long gown and sway around. It is not considered a big deal. If a person of the propertied class or someone with a considerable status were asked to wear a homespun gown, they would feel out of place and unable to see friends. In this world that "only values clothing and not people," there is such a situation.</p>
<p>According to a Hong Kong telegram yesterday, Deng Zeru proposed to the Political Committee to prohibit wearing foreign clothes, but it was not passed because it was difficult to implement. However, the provincial government issued an order yesterday that all civil servants must wear homespun long gowns. At a time when the standard of living is increasing day by day and the trend of extravagance and dissoluteness is rampant, promoting thrift and remembering to save the nation is the responsibility that the authorities should have. However, the Political Committee did not pass it because it was difficult to implement, which is puzzling.</p>
<p>All civil servants must eat. Assuming that this order is promulgated and vigorously implemented, there will never be a reason for them to refuse to wear homespun long gowns and voluntarily resign. Where is the difficulty? It is suspicious. The only ones who think it is difficult are the members of the Political Committee, who are mostly people of the propertied class and those with considerable status. If civil servants wear homespun long gowns while they themselves do not wear homespun long gowns, they would feel a little embarrassed. If they also wear homespun long gowns, it would seem to demean their status and would not be enough to show the authority of the committee members. The difficulty is probably here.</p>
<p>In fact, it doesn't matter. Mr. Feng Yuxiang wears old cloth short clothes, which are not as beautiful and elegant as Guangdong cloth long gowns, but he is still welcomed everywhere and is not treated like a poor Mr. Cai Yuanpei just because he wore an old cloth short jacket. It can be seen that a person's status and personality are by no means different because of the beauty or ugliness of their clothes.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if you are a person without personality, even if you wear very elaborate and authentic clothes, others will never recognize you as a person of personality and status, because there is such a misunderstanding of concepts. Therefore, people who live in cities often earn 20 yuan in salary and spend 19.8 yuan on clothes, which is pitiful and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Our country's production is so backward, and the people's ability to live is so weak, but the authorities are still unwilling to promote thrift as an example. What are their intentions? Taking Shanghai as an example, the most beautifully dressed women are prostitutes. I ask, what is the personality and status of prostitutes?</p>

<h3 id="e172">Construction and Use of Copper Roller Printing Machine <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Yu-cheng</p>
<p>A Scotsman named Bell first invented this copper roller printing machine in 1783. Two years later, he implemented this business in factories. Through years of machine improvements and scientific advancements, it has been gradually removed and renewed, resulting in today's achievements. Although it cannot be said that it has reached the pinnacle, it can be called perfect. So what does the latest modern printing machine look like? I will briefly explain its structure as follows:</p>
<p>It is roughly a hollow copper roller with engraved patterns on it, set on the outside of an iron shaft: a large iron roller rests on top of the copper roller: a brush rests below, and a paint tray supports the brush below. The tray contains paint: a part of the bottom of the brush is immersed in the paint: a sharp blade leans diagonally in the center of the copper roller. The copper roller rotates, and the paint is applied to the copper roller. After being scraped by the blade, the paint on the flat surface of the copper roller is completely scraped off. The engraved part is recessed and does not touch the scraper, so only the paint remains inside the engraved part: the outside of the large iron roller is surrounded by layers of wool felt, and the tightly pressed copper roller below gains elastic force: the outside of the wool felt is covered with a layer of wool lining felt or rubber cloth, so that the elastic properties are extra increased: the outside of the wool lining felt is covered with cotton lining cloth to protect the wool lining felt so that it is not touched and soiled by the paint on the copper roller: the outside of the cotton lining cloth is where the fabric to be printed is placed. When the machine is turned on, the paint on the copper roller, after being scraped by the blade, is left in the recessed area where it has been engraved, and the fabric to be printed on the outside of the large iron roller is pressed on top: relying on the elasticity of the wool felt in the middle: the carved pattern is printed on the fabric in the same pattern.</p>
<p>The entire printing machine is driven by a motor or water tank: when the large gear disc rotates, the small gear disc inlaid on the right end of the iron shaft above also moves, and at the same time, the gear disc on the left end of the iron shaft rotates the gear disc of the brush below. The paint in the disc follows the rotation of the brush, turning up and sticking to the top of the copper roller. The large iron shaft above also starts to rotate due to the pressure of the copper roller below. This endless mutual rotation prints fabrics with various patterns and designs. Science is truly omnipotent!</p>

<p>— A Reader</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Because people's hearts are different, each as unique as their faces, the truth of love is different for everyone. According to people with experience, the crystallization of true love is due to the union of spirit and flesh. The symbol of love can be divided into two sections using anatomical methods:</p>
<p>One, tangible love: People are spiritual animals, and inevitably have emotions: Since God has endowed people with a kind of emotion, then, it is easy to fall in love when encountering a suitable opposite sex. The joy between men and women, the beating of two hearts, forms a reluctant appearance. Over time, "headache," "fever," "vomiting," "sleepiness," "cramps," and other states follow the process of love and change in a thousand ways. Because this kind of morbid state can be diagnosed, it is called tangible love (Love Visible).</p>
<p>Two, intangible love: In other words, love is actually a mental illness. Or it can be said that it is the result of the nervous system being affected. In addition to the tendency of the spirit, there is also the requirement of the flesh. Because the nervous system is the hub of the brain (referring to the spirit) and the sexual organs (referring to the flesh), there is a close relationship. The soul constantly thinks, the body keeps burning, and the fire of love burns from the head to the eyes, and from the eyes to the whole body. So some people say that love and death are equally great | If there is no ability to control oneself, in the tragedy of unrequited love, the man will go crazy, and the woman will go silly, and even urgently take the path of suicide. Nervous breakdown, nervous abnormality, nervous abnormality are such painful things in the world! Because thoughts cannot be concentrated, and there is no medicine to cure mental illness, it is called intangible love (Love Invisible).</p>
<p>The pain and nerve influence of love are as described above, and from this we can further extend the magical power of love to society. The influence of love can make a robber who murders and arson improve and become a virtuous gentleman: Conversely, the damage of love can make a virtuous gentleman angry and do things that kill and bleed. Therefore, this new term 丨 love 丨 not only contains sociality, but also contains transformative, and has become an extremely serious problem in modern times. In history, in movies, in novels, I don't know how many times it has been performed. Recently, the love murder case between Ms. Tao Sijin and Sister Li is an example. Of course, love does not allow the intervention of a third party. They have their inside story, and I as the author have no right to interfere: But I myself am a part of society, and I have to think of some ways to improve it: How to increase the happiness of the crowd and reduce the pain of love?</p>
<p>I think my way is, one, to strive hard to make lovers become relatives: two, to believe in religion, to stabilize the soul and not to fall: three, to overcome desires with righteousness: to restrain emotions with reason: there are many good men and beautiful women in the world, and you can find another good couple. Four, thinking should be lofty, and vision should be broad: Although love is not successful, you can still do other work that is beneficial to the world. Sacrificing the small self to become the big self is not worthy of being a hero or heroine. Finally, let the author copy the teachings of the French General Foch to encourage general modern youths:</p>
<p>"Men should do more work: women should do more praying." Keep your own peace, complete your personality. School Portrait</p>

<p>This afternoon, the geography teacher from 1 to 2 took leave. But the notice was posted late, and the students were already waiting in the classroom. S and D stood at the classroom door, craning their necks, waiting for the echo of the classmate who went to inquire about the news. After a while, this scout jumped back with good news and said that the leave slip had been posted. At this point, the entire classroom exploded like soda bubbles rising from a bottle cap, with cheers, applause, laughter, and the sound of feet hitting the ground with stools all at once. Then groups of students, talking and laughing with books in hand, walked out of the classroom.</p>
<p>"Let's go eat ice cream!" S shouted from behind, calling out to D, who was heading out of the classroom door. D responded with a "yes," and turned the toes of his feet, which were originally turning right to go to the dormitory, 180 degrees and went with S.</p>
<p>Miss C, who loves quiet and not movement, was taking a class in this classroom in the next hour. One reason was to save running back and forth, and the other reason was that she saw other classmates all leaving, leaving only her alone. She just sat there quietly and read a book.</p>
<p>It was very hot. On the open space next to the classroom, there were usually several male students playing small leather balls, but now they were also driven away by the scorching sun. The surrounding air was unusually silent. Inside the classroom, only the sound of Miss C turning the pages of her book could be heard about every few minutes. But after half an hour, the sound of turning pages also stopped. Miss C fell asleep on the table.</p>
<p>S and D came back from a cold food store at the school gate. Just as they walked to the window of a classroom facing the corridor, S pulled D's arm, and the two stopped at the same time. D glanced at S, and then looked at the place indicated by S's pointed mouth.</p>
<p>"Miss C!" D was both surprised and happy.</p>
<p>"The sleeping face of a female student! It's rare to see!"</p>
<p>"Let's go in and have a good look!"</p>
<p>"I agree!"</p>
<p>The two entered the classroom quietly and walked close to Miss C.</p>
<p>D stared at Miss C's mouth for a long time. Miss C's lips twitched nervously. D said with an envious tone, "I don't know who will be lucky enough to get it in the future!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it easy to kiss? Now is an opportunity, anyway, she won't notice."</p>
<p>"Hmph, if you dare to kiss her, I'll treat you to ten cups of ice cream." "Really," I bet you don't dare. "Ten cups of ice cream have to count!" "Count."</p>
<p>S made up his mind, walked lightly to Miss C, bent down and carefully kissed Miss C's lips, but before S could lift his head, Miss C had woken up. She quickly wiped her mouth with a handkerchief like a reflex action, and angrily asked S, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"There was a fly on your lips? I:::" S himself felt that this answer was too weak, and couldn't help but laugh out loud. D also couldn't help but laugh loudly.</p>
<p>Miss C felt even more insulted by their laughter, and she threw herself on the table and cried loudly.</p>
<p>S and D looked at each other, everyone stuck out their tongues.</p>
<p>At this time, the end of class bell rang, and the students rushed over to see the show. S was afraid that the situation would escalate, and repeatedly said sorry to Miss C, but Miss C ignored him, stood up, covered her face with one hand, and cried out of the classroom. The classmates asked S and D one after another what was going on, but their answers were always "nothing."</p>
<p>The situation finally escalated. Miss C didn't go to class and cried on the bed in the dormitory. She refused to eat dinner. The female classmate in the same room reported it to the resident supervisor. The resident supervisor came to the girls' dormitory to ask, but Miss C didn't answer a single word.</p>
<p>All the male students in the school were discussing and speculating about the cause of the incident. Later, a rumor spread that S and D had committed violence against Miss C in a certain classroom, causing Miss C to have a bitter pill that she couldn't swallow.</p>
<p>S saw that the students' speculation exceeded his criminal behavior, and he was afraid that the school authorities would hear about it, which would be even more detrimental to him. He had to bravely go to the academic affairs office to confess. Of course, he added many words to defend himself, but he honestly confessed the fact of kissing.</p>
<p>The Dean of Academic Affairs thought very highly of the confession, so he advocated punishing S lightly, but because the class supervisor opposed it, the result was a compromise with a short notice posted.</p>
<p>S's insult to a female student will be recorded with a major demerit. Academic Affairs Office</p>
<p>Later, a male student criticized on the bulletin board:</p>
<p>"The price of a female student's kiss is only a major demerit, and there are ten cups of ice cream to eat! Worth it, worth it."</p>

<h3 id="e175">A Letter Filled with Loving Blood <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Man Qian</p>
<p>Dearest Sister G:</p>
<p>Sister G, our army at noon today has advanced to a valley only thirty or forty li away from City C. We are preparing to attack the city at dawn tomorrow, to recover my City C, which has been under the iron heel for nearly a year. Some of my brothers are writing letters, others are flexing their muscles, preparing for the fierce battle tomorrow. I am taking this opportunity to pick up my pen and talk to you, whom I haven't seen for over a month. I imagine you must be eagerly waiting for this!</p>
<p>Thinking of the past, it truly makes me extremely sad. But, separations in life are inevitable, especially since I am doing this to protect my country and fight my enemies. G! Do you remember, the day before I left home, I usually returned home around four o'clock in the afternoon after school, and at home, we would laugh and talk, but I had never been as late as eleven o'clock at night. This alone was enough to surprise you and my loving parents.</p>
<p>Then, seeing my face, full of hot blood and excitement, coupled with a sad expression due to the impending departure, when you heard me say "Your son has joined the volunteer army...", you were all simply stunned. Your eyes, I saw, were red, and in an instant, you covered your face and ran upstairs.</p>
<p>At this time, only Father, Mother, and I remained. Finally, Father broke the silence and said: "Hua'er! You must understand clearly, we are not used to life in the army. Indeed, everyone has the responsibility to love and save the country, but saving the country doesn't necessarily mean taking up a gun and fighting the enemy! The rear needs us even more, Hua'er! Listen to your father's words, I beg you..."</p>
<p>Father is an elderly man and cannot speak continuously for long. He had only said a few words and was already out of breath. Ah! I truly appreciate Father and deeply understand his good intentions, pitying his son's weak body, unable to endure the life in the military camp. At the same time, Mother was also saying through tears:</p>
<p>"Hua'er! It hasn't been easy raising you to this age. Once you leave your aging and sickly parents and your gentle and considerate wife, how can we bear it? Think about it, your father is old and useless, and I am just like this old woman, bedridden every other day. Your wife is already three months pregnant. If you leave us now to go to that bloody battlefield, what if something goes wrong? Who will we rely on?... Hua'er!"</p>
<p>Mother's words were filled with grief and she couldn't speak clearly. I couldn't help but cry in response. At the same time, I seemed to hear a very faint sobbing coming from upstairs. At this time, my heart was at war. "Go"? "Don't go"? But in the end, I firmly believed that the only way to find a way out for our country was through armed resistance, to go to the front line to kill enemies and sacrifice myself. Therefore, I still insisted on my opinion and resolutely replied with a "No."</p>
<p>It had been long past one o'clock. Father felt that there was no room for further persuasion. Finally, he said, "It's late, go upstairs and sleep. Are our words well-intentioned or malicious? Think about it carefully."</p>
<p>Without answering, I hesitated and walked into the room, seeing that you were not asleep, your eyes were red and swollen like walnuts. I really couldn't think of any words to comfort you. I just busied myself tidying up everything I needed, preparing to leave on time in the morning. Seeing me in this busy state, you must have been even more surprised, right? Otherwise, how could you ask me, "What are you doing? Are you leaving us tomorrow?" Ah! You cried softly. At this time, I didn't know what to do, except to hold you tightly, kiss you sweetly. It was only with great difficulty that you stopped crying and asked me, with a mix of resentment and sorrow, the reason for abandoning the family and going far away. I then told you about the oppression of the neighbor to the east, the decline of the country, the responsibilities of a citizen, and that my reason for leaving home was to find a way out for the country and seek survival for the nation. Who knew that you were also a woman with a heart full of passion? After hearing my words, you actually changed your overly sentimental attitude and even encouraged me with words, helping me pack my bags.</p>
<p>G! At this time, how happy I was in my heart! I couldn't help but give you another sweet and long kiss.</p>
<p>Sister G: Now, I'm making you tired, having to take care of family affairs, serve elderly parents, and being pregnant. Ah! I have nothing else to repay you with now. Every corner of this letter has been kissed by me. Now I send it to you, please savor it carefully! At the same time, I hope to kill a few more enemies tomorrow to comfort my soulmate. Goodbye, dear sister, your loving Hua on the day before the fierce battle.</p>
