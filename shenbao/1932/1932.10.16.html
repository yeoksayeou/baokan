<h3 id="c1">軍縮會議之展望·微 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>法總理赫禮歐於九月十八日在國會外交委員會中。攻擊德國之軍備平等要求。謂對於此種要求。將答以「事！永久！不可能！」三語。如法國之對總態度而果其然。則吾對於軍縮之前途。亦將答以「否！永久！不可能！」　　夫欲國際會議之有成。第一。參加國家必須捐除私見。披瀝誠意。第二。必須相互尊重平等之原則、「己所勿欲勿施於人。」若有一國而圖施展手段抱利己損人之意見則會議必難有良好之結果。此種淺顯之理論。謂各國政治家猶未了解其誰信之。</p>
<p>然而曠觀各種國際會議之經歷情形。似各國政治家。往往猶未能顧全此淺顯之理論對於己國誇大之主張。曉曉爭辯惟恐其不能貫澈對於他國平等之要求。節節堅拒。惟恐其達到目的。執如此態度以臨會議欲會議之有成誠戞乎其難矣。</p>
<p>軍縮問題。并質如何重大。對於世界和平。關係如何密切。故各國政治家。理應開誠佈公。共商圓滿解决之辦法。然而各國參加軍縮討論之代表。往往各守其固有之成見。不稍退讓。即如最近德國之軍備平等要求。異常堅决法國所取之反對態度。亦異常强硬如。此而欲使軍縮問題不陷於僵局。又　可得　　依理而論。德國對於軍備平等之要求。不能謂爲全不合理。蓋凡爾賽條約。雖規定德國陸軍僅限十萬。但各國亦負有準此裁减之義務。今和約訂結巳逾十年德國軍備巳受减削。而昔曾自約裁軍之協約國若法·若英·若意·若日。</p>
<p>非特不見减削軍備。反而有競爭軍備之趨勢。德國處此强鄰包園之中。能不惴然恐懼。其要求軍備之平等。誰曰不宜。其能得意國及其他小國之同情。亦理所當然也。</p>
<p>法國方面則亦自有其理由。以爲凡爾賽條約。任何人不能以片面的意思企圖解除。僅可以各簽字國之同意而加以修攺。蓋凡爾賽條約者。法人所視爲保障己國安全防備德國復仇之護符。在未得他種安全保障以前固决不容德國輕易變更也。</p>
<p>德國要求軍備平等之理由旣如被。法國拒絶德國要求之理由又如此德國在未得列强承認其要求以前。巳不願參加軍縮會議。而一方法國總理赫禮歐又有「否｜永久｜不可能｜」之表示。在此二極端之間。難有適當之調和方法。軍縮會議之必陷於僵局。可以斷言矣。</p>
<p>綜合二國所抱之意見而言之。各爲謀己國之安全。防他人之侵略吾人殊不能斷言誰爲合理。誰爲無理。然就另一方面言。則二國不能開誠佈公。以謀軍縮問題之解决。而促進世界之和平。其責任亦相同也。</p>
<p>此外英美各國所負之責任。亦正不亞於法德。蓋軍縮旣爲各國共同之事業。决不能抑此而助彼。利己以損人然而美國今方欲假借戰債問題。以換取法國之减削軍備。英國亦正欲利用軍縮問題以謀得有利自國之局勢。各國各爲己謀又何益於軍縮會議之進行哉。</p>
<p>最近法德間之軍備平等問題。巳由英美二國極力斡旋。初擬在倫敦召集五强會議。但現經英法會商决定仍在日内瓦召集英法德意之四國會議在國聨工作範圍内討論因德國要求軍備平等權利而引起之難題。英法意三國。均巳同意。但德國雖贊同此項集議。惟將聲明該會議應以德國平等要求爲唯一目的。不得在承認此項要求前拉　德國參加縮大會。是則德國之態度猶未攺變此項會議。恐難有良好之結果。即有結果可言。亦不出乎英法意三國聨合壓迫德國而巳。</p>
<p>總之在各國未有裁減軍備之誠意以前。而欲預言軍縮之成功惟有應之日「否｜永久｜不可能｜」。</p>

<p>第三屆上海萬國運動會、昨於中華田徑場上雄壯之軍樂聲中開幕矣、英國選手、奇鋒突出、於两項節目中、卽得二十一分、中華雖多其三分、然錦標希望頗少、短程競賽、英選手成績殊佳、中華健兒、有望塵莫及之概、百米預賽、两組成續、均爲十一秒三、爲英國選手所勝、千五百米英選手包辦前四名、時間爲四分二十一秒四、我國除于希渭偶然得有四分十五秒之非正式紀錄外、爲從來未有之成績、英國愛克爾之四百米時間五十二秒二、又英國華樂之高欄十六秒四、美國女子白乃特之跳高、一米三九、均爲我國未有之紀錄、幸而莊銘箴女士之跳遠、以四米六五開一新紀錄、此次男子成績、均有可觀、團體錦標、中英两國有劇烈競爭、預料今日决賽、雙方必出全力以爭、</p>

<p>中華健兒如不力爭恐難有望</p>
<p>此次萬國競技、事前咸料中華可穩得錦標、對於預測方面均重中美两國殊不知美國名將史璜克（上屆個人錦標）、今巳退伍、而湯史萊阿拉特輩、成績復大爲退步、今美國旣無所特長、中華保持軍似乎希望愈大、安知向來不景氣之英國、今屆奇鋒突出、氣燄萬丈、雖人數較少、但成績傑出昨日先包辦千五百米全四名、復得四百米接力第一两項得分巳達二十一、且在百米二百米四百米三項預賽中、非特成績冠軍且勢力浩大、希望實多、昨日總分中華雖多英國三分、然形勢殊爲危險此外尙有俄國選手之投擲勁軍亦爲中華之大患、故此次大會錦標、爲中英两國所必爭、卽使在單純項目中、中華之得分、或者不致少於英國然两項接力、中華希望極微、萬一英國再連勝八百米及千六百米两接力賽者則中華絶望矣、查英國選手大多爲駐滬陸軍蘭開夏、我國在世界競技塲中旣不能爭得一席地、如在上海之萬國運動會中、猶不能穩得冠軍、復何言哉、幸我中華健兒、努力奮鬥以保持我國出徑界些微之地位、實不勝企盼之至</p>

<p>跳遠一項我國人才濟濟、未比賽前、早知爲我家天下、但參加比賽者、仍謹愼小心以防演去年萬國運動會跳遠之故事、按去歲萬國運動會、跳遠一項、旣全爲我國包辦、至最後一人我國國旗四面、尙高懸於旗桿之上、一二三四、以示我國對於此項運動全勝不意最後一跳、美國史璜克竟冷門獨出、超過各人之成績、由第五一　而獲最後之勝利、原爲第一之王季淮、祇得進居第二、并若大銀杯、亦祇能目看史氏領受、眞所謂有氣說不出、故　年比賽、格外小心奕奕、不圖六次跳畢、又碰釘子、王季淮又以六米四十九之成績與美國亨弗萊並列第一眞可謂好事多磨但照田賽規則、無並列第一須再各跳一欠、視以一跳成績之優劣、以决名次之先後、王季淮目中生火、畢平生之力、一躍驚人、居然不負數千在塲觀衆之期望以六米六十九之成績、壓倒亨弗萊、并去年跳遠失敗之氣憤至今亦得一筆勾銷、四名成績如下、</p>

<p>二百米两組成績、以中華傅金城二三秒三爲最佳、但第二組霍列琪與史密斯、似未發揮威力、百米跑十一秒三之赫斯脫、爲傅壓倒、今日决賽、中華果碩僅存之傅金城、如能保持二三秒三之成績、當可獲得冠軍、</p>
<p>四百米英國發克爾以五十二秒十分二、創我國定前未有之紀錄、其姿勢步伐、均極優秀、中華選手、望塵莫及、今日决賽、中華至多祇得第三或第四耳、</p>

<p>西人會甲組聨賽之一</p>
<p>優游足球隊、昨日在棒球塲與法商會、作西人會甲組聨賽、劇戰九十分鐘、優游以四對七失敗、裁判何春輝、</p>
<p>旗開得勝優游參加甲組、本年乃第一次、隊員多宿星老將、而新進好手亦屬不少、故其表演成績、尙覺可觀、較諸法商隊、本亦難分彼此、惜乎射擊不工、良機累失、不然、當日勝負之數、安能預知、優游族開得勢、全軍入侵、毛鴻貴遙送一球、董小培施其當年約翰南洋爭雄時之身手、碰然一脚、打破龍門、乃轉顧之間、敵人反攻、利用任意球、雷及爾乘勢打進、各中一球、爲時僅五分鐘、</p>
<p>守門失責梁官濂曾一度名震申江、隱居巳久、技衛生疏、昨日損失七球之中、而咎在守者多數、一旦純熟、當可恢復前狀、十五分鐘之後、優游頗受壓迫、雖以朱　毛鴻貴陸士芳之堅拒、仍難擋住來軍、梁官濂進遇失措、連失二球、不久優游董小培又獨馬入關、上半時三對二、法商占先、</p>
<p>大喪元氣雙方勝負雖分、形勢平均、乃幸運不佳、董小培二次叫蘭、功虧一簣、而敵軍反連中三球、成二對六、從此元氣大喪、挽救乏衛、優游士氣奮發、五路並進、局勢轉見緊張、董小培沈柏貴各中一球、成四對六、最後法商又獲一球、結果七對四、法商勝、</p>

<p>原因複雜解决匪易</p>
<p>川民何辜遭茲塗炭</p>
<p>四川劉湘與劉文輝、自發生衝突後、内幕眞相、遠道傅聞、言人人殊、新聲社記者、爲使閱者瞭然於川局情形起見、爰於昨日下午、往訪川省革命前輩即前第四師師長陳戎公、陳氏與鄧田等皆有師生之雅、川中各中級軍官、多有出其門下者、故現雖退隱滬濱、耽於書畫、但於川省情形、仍時通消息、極多　瞭、茲特本其所述略誌大概如下、</p>
<p>两劉巳往歷史劉文輝之與劉湘、原係叔侄、當南京政府未成立以前、劉湘原係川軍第二師、時劉文輝尙祗旅長地位、叔侄之間、向來各樹一幟、途徑各異、惟異途同歸、仍時相衛護、故對内則各自勾心鬥角、擴張勢力、對外則各立異以轉移、以保其地位之鞏固、故如劉文輝关次之擁護閻馮、嗣後卽得劉湘之力而可不虞、反之、則劉文輝亦必出而衛護劉湘也、故川中一般人、以两劉之牽動、形同舞臺上之雙簧、恒名之爲串雙簧、其實两劉皆利用時機、以各增勢力而巳、故每次川戰發生、必在國内紛擾之際、使中央及其他方面、皆無暇注視及此、</p>
<p>此次衝突眞因以两劉過去之歷史觀之、在任何一方面、尙未有統一川省之實力時、似尙無衝突之可能而此次突有此舉、其原因不止一端、一方面由於最近劉文輝在外購買械彈、蓮川時爲劉湘扣留、劉文輝曾至重慶坐索一日、皆係劉湘委爲部下所爲、一再推托、結果、雖允查還、但仍祗空言搪塞、迄未實踐、於是劉文輝遂一氣走或都、準備以琥力對付、事爲劉湘所聞、當亦不甘示弱、但其時尙祗雙方互相示威而巳、其後因各方面見其有隙、復從而挑撥離間、一變而爲眞决裂是以此次两劉衝突、可謂爲弄假成眞另一方面、因劉湘年來對於中央方面、頗示好感、如派其師長王陸荃部至鄂西剿匪等、卽其一端、故欲乘機藉中央之力、統一四川、</p>
<p>雙方實力比較再经雙方實力而論、劉湘所轄、計五師加混成旅、約計人數在十三萬左右、械彈尙充足、惟武器稍舊耳、此外小兵艦共有四艘、亦有砲位、又供巡守之用、雙機十三架、中有轟炸機两架、偵察機三架、餘爲民用航空飛機、以之運輸簡要物品、亦至便利、而唐克車之數、亦頗不少、且劉湘部下、尙有一特色、卽有劉某一旅、號爲神兵、如各軍之軍師外、每遇用兵之際、皆先取决於此旅長、其效用若何、在外間人看之、眞所謂神妙莫測、但劉湘則絶對信任之、往者曾有一次、劉湘因演習投炸彈、事先向此旅長問休咎、當被堅稱不利、勸劉攺期、故劉雖仍往監視、但從左右之勸、遠避一傍、結果、是日飛機投彈、果因方向不準、炸彈爆發時、死傷兵士九十餘人、設劉不預先遠避、亦必禍及矣、自是以後、劉湘乃益信賴之、故川人咸稱之爲海陸空神云、至於劉湘軍隊之紀律、及訓練方面、皆遠不如劉文輝之努力、劉文輝所轄、係二師加混成旅、其編制訓練方面、一如袁世凱之馬廠練兵制、惟師長無直轄指揮之權每一師爲二旅、二旅之中、必有一旅爲其心腹統轄、人數與劉湘相等、器械皆最新式者、惟無飛機兵艦與唐克車耳、但以兵力之本身論、則劉文輝之實力、似較劉湘雄厚、且經濟方面、劉文輝之防地、因在成都一帶、極爲充裕、劉湘實遠不如之、最近且悉劉文輝因前次運械之失敗、業巳另闢途徑、另取道於雲貴桂陽等處矣、</p>
<p>川中各軍態度两劉旣起衝突、其餘各軍、依遠之間、實有左右全局之勢、此各軍之領袖、最堪注目者、當爲鄧錫候·田頌堯·劉存厚·楊森·羅澤洲·李其相等、鄧錫侯與田頌堯·因與劉文輝同爲保定軍官學校出身、以同一學系之故、常聨合一起、形如一團體、攻守同盟、關係極深、故近日報章所載鄧田助劉湘打倒劉文輝者、尙别有内幕也、蓋以劉田鄧之軍隊、皆在成都附近、平時有事、必須經三人通過、方能實現、若鄧田助劉湘而抑劉文輝、在此二人之本身利害關係、亦必不出此、故現在尙不斷然攺變常態者、不過在两劉之間、暗送秋波、從事挑撥、冀爲本身造機會而巳、因劉文輝之防地、較任何人防地爲富厚、故對劉湘方面、較爲明顯耳、設此次决裂而眞正火併時、彼等必乘機佔領、直接方面、必不爲两劉所用、至於劉存厚與楊森、以歷史及態度觀之、似皆傾向於劉湘、但現在似時機尙早耳、羅澤洲與李其相、原爲鄧錫侯之舊部、至今尙未完全脫離關係、故現在雖在劉湘一方面、將來必惟鄧之馬首是贍耳、</p>
<p>戰爭無好結果盡前上述、則雙方勢均力敵、實力可謂不分上下、更以地勢言、劉湘重心在重慶、位於長江下流、運輸必較困難、劉文輝部隊皆在上流、有居高臨下之勢、故成都方面、宜於攻、重慶因三面環江、自有天然之防禦工程、故宜於守、但以現勢觀察、劉湘因軍事設備較全、求速戰、劉文輝因尙在添購飛機等、表面雖似現在之接觸發動於彼、其實并不如此、蓋彼尙待一月後、方能實行進攻、蓋以在鄂西勦匪之王陵基部隊觀之、近來急急在宜昌一帶集中、可知劉湘備戰之亟也、但結果必仍此起彼伏、徒苦川民而巳、</p>
<p>解决川局非易現聞中央方面、</p>
<p>對於川事、整備派大員赴川調停、以上述之複雜原因觀之、恐去亦無辦法也、蓋两劉欲利用國難勦匪魯戰等之不安、從事伸張一巳之勢力、有所爲而爲之、决非片言所可解决、故欲解决川局、必待全國平靜、極力組織有力之川省政府、將各軍防地之政權經濟、交還省府、再以軍隊開駐藏康邊境、方能有相當辦法、至於川民之對两劉、因連年所受剥削、巳至極點、如各種稅、均有微之六十年以上者、亦從而可知之也、是故川省旅滬同鄉、因鑒於鄉男廿一年來、無日不在水深火熱之中、皆希望川局有一根本攺革辦法云、</p>

<p>— ·景·記</p>
<p>「崇實地，中崇虚神；以薪傅薪，誰主誰賓？」</p>
<p>這是相老人題贈劉君海粟的詞；因爲他的畫將在本市展覽一次，來函乞序町老人囑我代序，又親畫了一紙。</p>
<p>問「實地」和「虚神」怎樣解說？</p>
<p>相老人當下便有一妙喻，說了粟便是答案呢！我們相顧了片刻，相老人便帶笑容，又說了明白一些；｜</p>
<p>『把文字拆開來講；海字是虚神，因爲祇有水形每音；粟字是實地，像那本來的實物。何苦拘拘來解釋呢！我再隨便談談中西畫罷！』</p>
<p>中國畫，一筆两筆的描寫，名家便善能傅神；好像帶哲學的意味！墨井稱它呌「神逸」。其實，都是虚描，畫人面，不必耳目口鼻俱全的！　　西洋畫，有時很古怪··畫個人頭，描個魚身··像埃及的女首獅身的建築物；也要稱爲一偉大的藝術。我們看去，並不覺得有何意義！</p>
<p>現在中西互相傅習。眞所謂「以薪傅薪」；且看將來，比較競賽的結果，在畫史上誰佔優勝些！』</p>
<p>我們本想問一部，海粟君與裸體畫；繼思報載最近德政府下令禁裸體運動，說是文化衰落的現像；相老人當然也不會來說恭維話的！</p>

<p>｜希望國人加以猛省｜</p>
<p>求人不如求己·一這話，雖是老生常談，確有深意。國民根性，壤在依靠，社會上做事，先要有靠山，試問行政人員，那個沒有靠山？山不高，靠不牢，山一崩，靠就倒，所謂「蔦蘿失蔭」者是。此性不攺，一人不修，一家不齊，一國不治，天下不平；移風易俗，端賴敎育的陶鎔，有責者曷起行之｜</p>
<p>「弱國無外交，」這話，爲高調先生們所最反對，中國是弱國，無可諱言，然而果弱國乎？我以爲國之强弱，全在人爲，倘欲轉弱爲强，亦未嘗不可，所謂「非不能也，實不爲也，」中國豈長此紛亂，端賴行政首領克己進賢，努力爲國家民族謀永久之幸福。</p>
<p>國聨不可靠，中外人人言，國聨爲帝國主義集團，日本帝國，五强之一，國聨自然不能不敷衍；像我老大中國，彷彿是麻木的睡獅，誰肯來理你呢？扶弱抑强，不過是這麽一句「口頭禪」罷了。國際間只有「利害結合，」談不到「國際信誼！」</p>
<p>「求人不如求己，」我希望中央政府眞能一心一德的糾正軍人的割據，要集中政治力量；集中全國的人才和經濟，爲安内攘外的救國工作。打倒日本，就是摧毁一切帝國主義者的壁壘的開端，日帝國主義者崩崩潰了，國際才有平等的希望！</p>

<p>一般摩登男女青年們，都喜歡談戀愛，不錯，這是一種必然的心理。可是要知道愛的力是最大，它容易使你成功，幸福，也不難給你消極，頺廢　　現在有一個很好很曲折很有意義的故事，這故事大概是這樣的··有一個大學生，起先是屬於頺廢派的人物，可是，不久有了一個愛人。他興奮了，努力了，不料好事多磨，他竟誤會伊的哥哥是他的情敵，竟又消極起來，正想自殺以了一生，他的情人是救了他，明白了一切，有情人終成眷屬。</p>
<p>這故事中表明的··（一）戀愛的唯一障礙，是「疑」和「妬」。（二）戀愛的成功，是非經過一番曲折不易成功。（三）爲了戀愛，會興奮，同時也會不要命，這可見愛的力是何等的大。</p>

<p>— ·天·虚·我·生</p>
<p>我之目的，在使蠶蛹不在繭内，而無絲吐頭之消耗，每一個蠶所吐之絲，完全可作正用，且免烘繭手續，故爲此項設計，其利甚多··不用蠶簇，減省地位，一也；蠶之糞溺，不在繭内，表裏純潔，一絲不亂，二也；蛹不在内，繭之重量，卽是純絲重量，售價得高，三也；不用火烘，决無化蛾蛟出之虞，工本减少，産增多，而且成色優良，四也；每房客蠶一百五十頭，高僅三寸，長僅一尺，闊約半尺，略如一面算盤，可以疊起如砌磚牆之式，但有二尺之地，長約一丈，疊高六尺，卽容三百房，每次可收無蛹繭百斤，輕巧便利，婦　皆優爲之。茲述其制如左··</p>
<p>以二分厚之板片作四圍之牆，高一寸半，闊七寸，長十二寸，不用蓋，其底用四分厚板，鑽三分徑孔，縱十孔，横十五孔，形如火柴盒内之屜，内用紙板，分爲一百五十方格，每格見方六分，另以細紙板切如香烟片狀，闊一寸半，長二寸半，在木棒上卷成圓筒，無須粘牢，任其能卷能舒，於是將此卷筒，插入每個方格之内，使其内層成爲圓形，盒底板下，生四脚，高一寸，全體之高不過三寸而己。如是製備，每三百房，機製成本，不過三五十元，至少可用十數年，縱有損壞，不過内層紙板，每換一次，不過費洋數分而巳。（注意、板片必須蒸煮，除凈樹脂及其氣味，紙板亦須除去硫質及石灰或漂粉等有害物質。但小試不妨用普通市品，縱有損失亦甚小也。</p>
<p>凡在平時可以上山之蠶，卽移置於盒底之下，以蠶身引入孔中，而露其尾於底板之外，蠶之半身，旣巳入孔，卽在紙卷中做繭，遣漏悉在盒底之外，可襯以紙，便於疊起，不致汚及下房。蠶吐絲時，自以爲身在繭中，不見光亮，故不掉頭，漸吐漸向後褪，及至絲己吐盡，則成蛹於盒底之下，不在繭中。</p>
<p>采繭手續，于爲簡單，但將紙卷向上抽出，展開卽得，比在簇上采繭爲便，其紙卷仍人方格，以備二次之用。循環不息，一歲之中，所省工料之費，不在少數。而銷售繭子，不必火烘，可免遏抑之弊；待價而沽，决無陳腐这虞，且可壓榨打包，於運輸上亦便利多矣。</p>
<p>上述計劃，係因鑒於絲棉一項，每年産量甚多，多産一斤絲棉，卽今養蠶之家，减損一宗繭價，而絲棉所織之綢，名爲棉綢，因係咬斷之絲，接綴成線，故有纍之粒，浮出於綢面，引之卽能伸長，頗爲减損綢價之一大原因。本年雖經提倡，攺良染色，服用者多，但其價格甚低，於蠶户不生利益。爰念欲矯其弊，必使蠶蛹不在繭内，方可免除化蛾咬出之險，故爲設計如上。深願爲農村放欵事業之金融家，采用此項新式繭房，發給蠶户而收其繭，論個數而不論斤，則不攺其　償之眼光，自必樂於從事。（普通有蛹之繭平均四百五十個一斤）但收一市，己足攺革其數各年之結習，而收一勞永逸之利，銷出洋莊，亦必樂於購用此種「無蛹繭，」可以减少一切疑難，而水脚運費之所省，亦正可以减輕過半數也。</p>
<p>現屆秋蠶上簇期間，　銷小試，以定明春大舉實行之計畫，庶於置備機械，特設一廠，專工製此，尙及乘時供應，爲農村經濟之一助，不致徒爲紙上空談，竊願馨香　祝，以觀　成。</p>

<p>「你走得這樣慌忙，顯見是還業我有氣。一貞！難得一同出游的，能夠多陪我一半刻，向這公圍裏到處游賞一遭嗎？」魯伯勤很勤懇的在挽留。</p>

<p>「找個乾凈座喝點茶再走，好嗎？」</p>
<p>「人太雜了，不好。」</p>
<p>「那麽，河裏有船，我們賃一隻下河去划船玩罷。」</p>
<p>佟一貞沉吟了片晌，終於推辭著道··「我實在還有事，就要回去，攺天再來陪你划船罷。」</p>
<p>魯伯勤見伊仍是沒精打采，就也不再勉强，而順口送了個人情道··「這樣，我也不高興在這裏多玩了，同你一道出去，雇車陪你回家好了。」</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>自從萬泉公園會談之後，佟一貞對魯伯勤果像冷淡了一些，但英文夜館還是每晚必到，尙有魯伯勤隨時多加解釋或勸慰的機會，并也探問佟家一些情况。</p>
<p>高副官還是不斷的來與李司令說媒，佟一貞的叔嬸貪圖富貴，自然也是千肯萬肯的願攀這門高親。但那份五姨太太，總要佟一貞願意去做才行；在這個文明的年頭兒，總不能再施行中古時代那搶親掠婚的暴舉。於是熱心的叔嬸們，不能與姪女作公開的談判了。</p>

<p>— ·佛</p>
<p>民三我曾著「吹牛拍馬講義」一書，（該書發行未久，即爲袁氏所禁）内有一節，大致謂吹牛與拍馬，有連鎖性，有正負性的，如善吹牛者，必喜拍馬，喜拍馬者，必善吹牛，並引歷史上事實爲之證明，其實人類原是勢利動物，假定你透視一些，無論在政局或社會的那一方，總可看出，</p>
<p>昨見報載，胡佛總統乘此間大理院新厦安置基石之際，在白宮開招待會，共邀來賓四千人，來賓皆以與總統一握手爲榮，四千人中巳握手者，約及三分之二，時總統右手微破流血，殆爲約指壓而使然，後經醫士勸告，乃退休，於是餘客感爲向隅，此種希奇情形，完全爲一種虚榮心的表現，而此虚榮心，即爲吹牛和拍馬二者組合而成，</p>
<p>總統是圓顱方趾横目準鼻之一人，而平民亦圓顱方趾横目準鼻之一人，同是人類，同是一人，一握手何足爲榮，不握手何足爲辱，而一般賓客的心理，則大異其趣，於此可見外人虚榮心之豐富，較諸我國尤爲發逹也，且美爲民主國國家，總統任期旣滿，即爲平民，平民一旦獲選，卽爲總統，則總統與平民，原是相去一間，故西哲有言，總統爲人民公僕，旣爲公僕，則握手何榮，不握手何辱，</p>
<p>若以此推之，則專制時代的帝王，萬一與平民偶一握手，則其榮幸爲何如，我曾見一書，（大約是隨園詩話，業巳不能舉其辭，其事實似如此，）清世祖南巡時，某蘭若方丈，出外接駕，皇上一把其臂，嗣後該僧延接任何施主檀越。祇舉左手表示敬禮，因右手曾與皇上接觸，决不輕易舉手也，我曾笑僧界中人，最爲勢利，最善逢迎，萬一皇上一拂其鬚，則該僧將久遠不吃飯矣，　　本來我說虚榮心之發達，莫過於我國，今見美國如此情形，不免猶有望洋興嘆之感矣，但此種虚榮心之本身，是一種劣根性乎，還是善者機也，我曰是善者機，人類不可無此虚榮心，我中國因無此虚榮心，故任人糟蹋，而不一爲反抗，假令有一些虚榮心存在，何至爲外人蹂躏若此，</p>

<p>— ·沈·爾·明</p>
<p>漆的用途，人人知道，是一種重要的塗料，如鐵器塗漆後能防銹，木器塗漆後美觀耐用，而以天然漆爲著，故把牠普通的知識，寫在下面，</p>
<p>（一）採液此部手續極爲重要，若隨意劃割，則漆液損失非小，故先述之，漆　　　　　　　　　　　　　，　　者常在山，直　可　徐，生命不　十年，大樹每年採三次，中樹二次，小樹一次，大樹每株出漆二十两左右，小樹約十五两，</p>
<p>野生者於距地七寸之處，入刃劉傷樹皮，長六七寸，深二分許，出漆不旺時，可用水滋潤，漆液將盡時，可於樹頂置草灼之，齊根劃傷，餘漆即從傷口流出，</p>
<p>種植者，劃傷三道，作三角形，漆液由两邊流出，以竹筒承之，野生大樹每次可劃傷二十道以上，每隔三小時用竹筒收集一次，筒滿則移入漆桶，用麻刀紙遮蓋，初採時之漆液，含水不透明，故需提凈，法將漆液盛於淺盤，在烈日中曝晒，三小時内可清，晒時須不時拌和，助水氣昇散，迨全體呈紫色爲止，晒過後更用麻布或棉花格清，盛入瓷器儲藏，</p>
<p>（二）配製以漆一千分，與鐵屑八分，或以漆一百分，與醋酸五分，混匀爲黑漆，</p>
<p>以漆一百二十八分，加骨炭一分，熟茶油十分，得黑色光漆，</p>
<p>以漆和等量蘇子油，加水拌匀，煑去水分，和顔料，得瓷光秞，</p>
<p>以漆一百分，銀朱九十分，混匀，得朱漆</p>
<p>以漆和等量熟桐油，結膜堅固光亮，用塗木器，不掩木紋，耐潮熟，</p>
<p>（三）品質據吉田氏之研究，漆酸（Laccicacid）佔精漆之八五％其他之一五％爲膠質，釀質（即含氮體）及水等，漆遇空氣起硬化，蓋由於釀質之作用，故用熱將釀質破壞，則不起硬化，通常硬化可需時間爲十小時，加小量甘油，則僅需二小時，</p>
<p>漆之多膠者劣，多酸者佳，漆液乾燥最適宜之温度，在攝氏一○至三○度之間，乾燥時漆液體重，且能增加，增加多少隨歷日之長久而定，</p>

<p>｜怎樣處置街頭流浪的兒童｜</p>
<p>倘你是一個老於上海搭電車有點經騐的，那你就覺得有一件討厭的事情，｜就是電車站頭的乞丐。</p>
<p>昨天上午在東新橋候車，這時有一個年紀不過六七歲的小孩，赤着雙足，身上的衣服，當然是破舊不堪，手裏拿了一只香烟盒，在人叢中，擠來擠去的求乞，小小的年紀居然學會得一口的恭維話，老爺，少爺，修福，發財，的話追隨在路人的後面，當時有一個西裝少年挽着一個摩登女郎走過，那小孩不惜工本我釘去，追隨約有數十步，卒由他的毅力，得到一個銅元的布施。他歡喜跳躍的跑到對過浙江路口大餅攤上，合着匣子裏原有的二個銅元，買了一個大餅就坐在馬路旁邊吃，看他愉快的神情，雖當家兒的吃人參獲苓糕，也不足比也。我富時給他天眞爛漫的表情所感動，眞覺得啼笑不得。此等兒童，倘生在富有之家，那是正當坐了包車上學去的時代，今則流浪街上，奔走乞食，使其日與惡環境相接觸，他們對於都市的物質文明，固無福分享；獨對於都市的一切罪惡，則以耳濡目染之故，早巳心領神會，他日成　　，欲責其爲一善良的公民，以安可得？</p>
<p>像這樣不敎不養的流浪兒童，全上海大概也不少吧，他們在馬路上受敎育，在飢寒逼迫中長養起來，所過的是非人生活，要是將來有出頭之日，也不過成爲一個靠馬路吃飯的馬路大享而巳。這就形成了游民階級，所以社會上要正本清源的杜絶游民，應當從收容及敎養貧苦敎養兒童入手，敎以一藝之長，使成爲生産的一份子、這樣社會上的罪惡一定要减却不少。這不特爲兒童造福、同時也是負地方上行政之責者應負的責任。</p>
<p>在這許多流流兒童中。若加以敎育，豈無一二偉人傑士，特未加磨琢耳，我國人口雖衆，但因敎育的不普及埋沒人才，眞難算計，民爲邦本，兒童爲將來之主人翁，　　句話，誰能信行　　不　。一般人對於這一個　重的社會問題，爲什麽毫不重視，上海不少有錢的人深怕給綁票綁去，家中請了保鏢的來保護，獨對於將要做綁票的人，不肯加一些救濟，眞使人費解。</p>
<p>據我所知，上海收容游民的有淞滬敎養院與游民習勤所，但二處都不是以兒童爲本位的，對於管理及敎育方面，諸多不便，鄙意應當設立一個規模校大的貧苦兒童敎養院，收容一般貧苦人家的子女，授以普通智識｜其程度當在國民小學與平民學校之間，並加以工藝的訓練，使有一技之長，將來可藉以自謀生活。</p>
<p>敎育家，慈善家及關心社會問題的人們，請少辦一所貴族化的幼稚園，來辦這一所爲貧苦兒童造福的樂園吧！謹將此意，提付公衆討論。</p>

<h3 id="c214">金寳的厄運 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— ·洪·水</p>
<p>當樂樂糖果店不愼起火之後，金寳也淪陷在可怕的失業中，歲爲如流，怱怱一年的光陰他終日在憂慮悲痛中過去了！轉辗輾苦悶的生活壓迫得眞夠難受；他想自殺，倘如沒有了賢妻愛兒的話。現在他惟一的希望期待着小蓮早日長大，成家立業，以謀晚年泰山之靠；但事實是這樣；「愈冷愈括風，愈貧愈生病」。這話一點兒也不錯；金寳呆巴巴的硬着頭皮眼看生得玲瓏活潑天姿聰明的孩子病亡！於是妻發狂得時而到土地廟求神禱告，以冀禳災，並得哲嗣，現在吳鑑光算他們老夫妻俩不久的將來，有段老運；不是興家立業，就是聨生貴子。因此，他們無形中忘懷了平日所鍾愛的兒子小蓮！</p>
<p>暮色是濃了，金寳的希望隨着西山落日沈到渺茫中去了。</p>
<p>「金寳，明朝的米是完結的呢？！」晚飯桌上，妻沉重的緊皺着雙眉，悽慘悲哀的開始對他的丈夫說。</p>
<p>「喔！」他長啑了一聲，他那失神的眼球望着妻同樣黄皮憔悴的面孔，他怕，他低下了頭，好像有滿腹的痛苦說不出來。</p>
<p>「唉！難道你更要我難堪嗎？金寳，金寳！」</p>
<p>「親愛的，你想我如何辦呢｜在這個失業中？不是算命先生算我有段很好的老運嗎？暫且勿庸着急！總有一天時來運通，大發其財的機會呢！」</p>
<p>「嘻！」</p>
<p>「我現在想邀集幾位親朋，來做两百洋鈿的會，先進行做小生意。一旦成功的話，那末，生活諸多不成問題哩」　　「打算做什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「剛上市的天津良鄉栗子。」</p>
<p>不幾天，也許金寳的老運快要來了吧！他的計畫居然成功而實現了，他在一條繁華熱閙擠滿了人羣的馬路轉角，擺起一個栗子攤頭，公然也掛起很引誘人注目的「路中仙」一塊玻璃地鑲的金字照牌。金寳喜氣洋溢的忙着炒栗子，包栗子，並且他他曉得賣栗子必須要開唱留聲機來廣招顧客的，「覇王别姬」「狸猫換太子」「蘇州景」輪流開個不歇；他們除掉先捐給馬路照會五只洋和孝敬三三两两巡捕老爺幾包栗子外，每天平均總好賺三四元；他們心靈一動，就連想到這位算命先生的話更是歡大喜地。今晚攤頭上站滿了人，生意愈是出乎意料的興隆，金寳炒炒栗子，望望妻，大有不可一世之概！妻也點着頭自鳴得意的露出微笑的當兒，突有來勢兇兇两位者得全黑的「不速之客」擠進人叢中來，一刹那空洋箱翻了天似乎向着主人呆默出神，顯然空氣異常雜亂，一陣陣齊呼「捉捉捉，捉强盜！」金寳是暈倒在鑪鍋旁不動，只有妻　　　　的跳來跳去　　！他們的運命於是不得不陷於絶境了。</p>
<p>不可思議</p>
<h3 id="c215">奇怪現象 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— ·文·炳</p>
<p>······與一百年以前法國傅利葉監督將小麥抛棄海中事實同類······</p>
<p>其實這種現象，並不奇怪，而且平常，古人不也說過麽，「朱門酒肉臭，路有餓死骨，」只是這純然是文學的口吻，描寫世界上的人，吃的吃不了，沒吃的餓得肚皮呌，暗示着人類生活如此不平·而沒有像社會科學那樣的加以闡明罷了。</p>
<p>是大前天傍晚，我忽然想走到吳淞路去，於是果眞走去了，唯一的目的，自然因爲那是一條衣店馬路，天氣有些寒冷了，想去買一件起碼的絨綫衣着着，免得賤體冷壞了，喊娘喊爹！請不到醫生，住不起醫院，事實偏偏那麽捉弄人，衣店裏的定價，都與我的意思相差天遠，使我白走了一趟，慢慢地蹁到了天鐘路口，那兒正簇聚着一羣羣的呌化，灰黄色的電光，映射着他們的形相，有老婆婆，老頭兒，小孩子，衣裳是襤褸齷齷，露骨的皮肉，活像蘇詶河裏的爛泥，有的蹲着脚亂手忙，有的立在旁邊嚷呌，我知道那是無法衝進的陣圍，只好耐着性子站在近旁，等他們走散後，看到底是怎樣一回事。</p>
<p>這時候，我的腦海裏掀起了思索的旋廻，雖然猜不正那究竟是什麽一回事，但至少可以預定是與人類生活有關，尤其與低級的平民生活有關，他們不是在搶吃的食品，便是在搶爛衣及其他。　　正在沉思，他們畢竟嘩然一亂走散了，原來走來了两個紅頭阿三，手裏拿着哭喪棒，兇兇地在驅打，我走近前去，仔細端詳，那兒還殘賸着一大堆的腐爛了的黄瓜。</p>
<p>黄瓜，這時候多麽可口呵！</p>
<p>在温帶，那是要夏天才有的蔬果，在夏天天然是不希奇·然一到了秋天，總算是珍貴的食品了，因爲要從南方廣東運來，在一般的食品店裏，這時候是沒有的了，（霞飛路一帶的食品店中，自然陳列多着·）雖然一般人所需要的還是麵包，沒有口福去嘗試這過時佳品的滋味，但該當如何的珍視它！而今竟把它腐爛，抛棄，這是何等奇怪的務盾現象！</p>
<p>我思忖過後，與頭一望，原來就在XX蔬果行的店前，那兒的玻璃裏還陳列着各種貴重的新鮮食品，更使我憶起一百年以前法國一件同類，意義尤較重大的事實。</p>
<p>那是如此的；</p>
<p>大約離今一百年前，法國有一人名呌傅利葉，他年幼時在馬賽一個糧食店裏工作，有一天那糧食店裏要將從停泊馬賽港的船舶輸入的小麥抛棄到海裏去，他受命去做這事的監督，當時法國正遇着凶荒，缺少小麥，多數窮人，都以馬鈴，薯代麵包吃，可是那些糧食商人，却還爲着抬高小麥價錢，將輸入的小麥匿藏船裏，以致小麥腐爛，着人抛棄海中，一方面有多數要小麥而無小麥可吃的人，他方面又有特意將輸入的小麥使其腐爛而棄海裏的人·這究竟是什麽一回事呢？傅利葉看見這種奇怪的現象，就起了一個欵問·以爲現在的社會組織，一定有了什麽缺陷，從此以後，他就犧牲他一生去研究理想社會的組織。　　其實這是很平常的事實，只是於今爲烈，我們該怎樣去應付這矛盾現象呵</p>

<h3 id="e1">Prospects for the Disarmament Conference · A Slight View <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>French Premier Herriot, in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly on September 18th, attacked Germany's demand for equality in armaments, saying that to this demand he would answer with the three words "Never! Ever! Impossible!" If France's general attitude is indeed as such, then to the future of disarmament, we shall also answer with "No! Never! Impossible!" For an international conference to be successful, first, participating nations must discard their prejudices and lay bare their sincerity. Second, they must mutually respect the principle of equality: "Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you." If one nation attempts to use tricks and hold self-serving and harmful ideas, then the conference will inevitably be difficult to yield good results. This kind of simple theory, who would believe that the politicians of each country do not yet understand it?</p>
<p>However, looking at the experiences of various international conferences, it seems that politicians of various countries often fail to take into account this simple theory, exaggerating their own country's claims, arguing loudly, fearing that they cannot be thoroughly implemented, and staunchly rejecting the equal demands of other countries, fearing that they will achieve their goals. Holding such an attitude to attend a conference, to make the conference successful is truly difficult.</p>
<p>The issue of disarmament, with its crucial nature, and the closeness of its relationship to world peace, should mean that the politicians of each country should be candid and open, jointly discussing ways to achieve a satisfactory solution. However, the representatives of various countries participating in disarmament discussions often adhere to their inherent prejudices without yielding even a little. For example, the recent German demand for equality in armaments is extraordinarily firm, and the opposition attitude taken by France is also extraordinarily strong. If this continues, and one desires the disarmament issue not to fall into a stalemate, is it possible? According to reason, Germany's demand for equality in armaments cannot be said to be completely unreasonable. Although the Treaty of Versailles stipulates that the German army is limited to only 100,000 men, all countries are also responsible for reducing their forces accordingly. Now that the treaty has been signed for more than ten years, German armaments have already been reduced, but the Allied countries that once committed to disarmament, such as France, Britain, Italy, and Japan,</p>
<p>not only have not reduced their armaments, but have instead shown a tendency to compete in armaments. Germany, situated in the midst of this encirclement of powerful neighbors, cannot but feel fearful. Its demand for equality in armaments, who can say it is inappropriate? It is only natural that it can gain the sympathy of Italy and other small countries.</p>
<p>On the French side, there is also its own reason. They believe that the Treaty of Versailles cannot be unilaterally attempted to be lifted by anyone's own interpretation; it can only be modified with the consent of all signatory nations. The Treaty of Versailles is regarded by the French as a talisman to ensure their national security and prevent German revenge. Without obtaining other security guarantees, France will certainly not allow Germany to easily change it.</p>
<p>Germany's reasons for demanding equality in armaments are already as described; France's reasons for rejecting Germany's demands are also such. Before Germany has obtained the recognition of its demands from the Great Powers, it is unwilling to participate in the disarmament conference. On the other hand, French Premier Herriot has the expression of "No! Ever! Impossible!" Between these two extremes, it is difficult to find a suitable method of harmonization. It can be asserted that the disarmament conference will inevitably fall into a stalemate.</p>
<p>Combining the opinions held by the two countries, each is acting for the sake of its own national security, preventing the aggression of others. We cannot definitively say who is reasonable and who is unreasonable. However, on the other hand, the two countries cannot be candid and open to seek a solution to the disarmament issue and promote world peace. Their responsibility is also the same.</p>
<p>In addition, the responsibilities borne by Britain and the United States are no less than those of France and Germany. Since disarmament is a common undertaking of all countries, it is impossible to suppress this and help that, benefiting oneself at the expense of others. However, the United States now wants to use the issue of war debts to exchange for France's reduction of armaments. Britain also wants to use the disarmament issue to seek a situation favorable to its own country. With each country acting for its own interests, what benefit is there to the progress of the disarmament conference?</p>
<p>Recently, the arms equality issue between France and Germany has been actively mediated by Britain and the United States. Initially, it was planned to convene a five-power conference in London. However, after consultations between Britain and France, it has been decided to convene a four-nation conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in Geneva to discuss the difficulties arising from Germany's demand for equal rights in armaments within the framework of the League of Nations. Britain, France, and Italy have all agreed. However, although Germany supports this gathering, it will declare that the conference should take Germany's demand for equality as its sole purpose and should not pull Germany into a large disarmament conference before recognizing this demand. In that case, Germany's attitude has not yet changed. This conference is feared to be difficult to yield good results. Even if there are results to speak of, it will not go beyond the three countries of Britain, France, and Italy jointly suppressing Germany.</p>
<p>In short, before the countries have the sincerity to reduce armaments, if one wants to predict the success of disarmament, one can only answer with "No! Ever! Impossible!"</p>

<p>(Shanhaiguan) Zhu Jiqing personally supervised the National Salvation Army of Ma Zidan, Meng Wuyan, Li Haizhi, and others to attack the city of Yixian, engaging in fierce battle with approximately 700 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery soldiers.

It is reported that the Japanese army has increased its forces along the Jin-Chao (Jinxi-Chaoyang) line to prevent Zhu's forces, and the commander of the Suzuki Brigade stationed in Jinzhou is personally directing the operations.

Suzuki Brigade Commander of the Japanese army directed more than 1,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery to resist, and the battle was very fierce, with airplanes also providing assistance. The Salvation Army, in order to avoid sacrifices, ambushed at night and operated, having been in a stalemate for four nights, with mutual casualties. The Salvation Army dispatched several daredevil teams to infiltrate the city. On the 13th night, they launched an uprising, and the order was greatly disrupted. The Salvation Army approached the city moat, but due to weak artillery fire, they were unable to capture it. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The First Route of the Righteous Army, Wu Leiyuan's troops, have recovered Yitong, Shuangyang, Panshi, and Huadian four counties. The Japanese intend to reoccupy the four counties.

Wu was away on official business, and his subordinate, Wang Yudong, led more than 2,000 men to resist strongly and notified Shuangyang and other counties for assistance. The fierce battle is still ongoing. (15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cheng Guorui, formerly under Zhang Zongchang's command, went from Dalian to Changchun and transited through Shenyang on the 13th. Cheng claimed that the Japanese-Manchu authorities entrusted him to train six divisions of elite troops within a year. He himself will return to Dalian soon to gather his troops and begin organizing. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Commander of the Jilin National Salvation Army, Li Du, wrote to a certain source, stating that he would rather sacrifice himself for the country and would never submit to slavery. His army initially consisted of only one brigade, but now it exceeds 100,000, demonstrating the fervent spirit of the three northeastern provinces. He hopes that an order to punish the rebels will be issued soon to uphold justice. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain military officer of Feng Zhanhai's troops, stationed in Beiping, spoke of how Feng's forces, after capturing Jilin city last month and voluntarily withdrawing at the request of the people, dispatched Gong Changhai's unit to continue the attack on Jilin city in late last month. Feng himself led tens of thousands of elite troops to advance westward from Jilin, reaching the Tongliao area in northern Liaoning. They have heavily deployed forces along the line, and communication and liaison are very convenient. Feng is currently directing operations in a certain location and will launch a counterattack on Changchun after clothing and ammunition are replenished. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">National Salvation Army Occupies Nuerhe Station <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) More than 1,000 righteous soldiers attacked Chenzhuang and Nuerhe from Hongluoxian on the morning of the 13th. The Japanese Nakajima unit and puppet police responded. The righteous army attacked the Nuerhe station, burning down the station and post office. Seven or eight Japanese soldiers and police were injured. On the night of the 14th, the righteous army retreated. The puppet Fengshan (Fengtian-Shanhaiguan) railway train stopped at Dahushan and dared not advance. At the same time, the righteous army was found attacking Goubangzi, and the battle situation is unclear. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the National Salvation Army of Dong Rongji occupied Nuerhe Station, the Japanese army repeatedly bombed it with airplanes and sent puppet troops to cause disturbances from time to time. At dusk on the 13th, an armored train came from Jinzhou, along with more than 2,000 Japanese and Korean soldiers and artillery, under the cover of tanks, launching a fierce attack on the National Salvation Army. Our army, under the command of Wang Yongliang, confronted them with a broadsword team, charging and killing at night, wounding many enemies. On the 14th noon, unable to hold out, the entire army retreated towards Jinzhou. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Ma Zhanshan's Troops Capture Taianzhen <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan wired from Heihe on the 10th, stating that his troops had completed coordination with the Su and Zhang brigades. On the morning of the 7th, he issued a general attack order and personally commanded the main force in the center.

After two days and nights of fierce fighting, they finally captured Taianzhen. The remnants of the enemy fled towards Shenyang, and our army is currently pursuing them. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A person from Rehe stated that Tang Yulin strictly prohibits local officials from leaving their posts without authorization. Our army's equipment in Chaoyang County is very substantial, so although Japanese aircraft constantly fly to Chaoyang County for reconnaissance, they dare not fly low to avoid being shot down. At noon on the 12th in Lingyuan County, a Japanese plane flying from Jinzhou dropped red and green leaflets, persuading villagers and the Righteous Army to surrender. The puppet state villagers all understood the greater righteousness and were not swayed. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) This afternoon, a message from Tianjin was received here, stating that the Japanese army shelled the southern mountains of Rehe yesterday morning.

<p>Li Yue Returned to Nanjing Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Communists Discovered in Rizhao</p>
<p>Korean Army Takes Over Yantai</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Staff officer Li Yue from the Military Affairs Commission, who was dispatched to Jiaodong to inspect the Han-Liu positions, returned to Nanjing on the 15th morning, met with He Yingqin, reported on the trip to Shandong, and telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek to report on the developments. According to Li, Han and Liu have both complied with the central government's order to cease fire and are awaiting a solution. As long as the central government has a solution, the siege can be lifted immediately. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Yue stated that the solution to the Shandong issue is being carefully discussed by He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, and Jiang Bocheng in Jinan. It is expected that a decision will be made soon. (Special dispatch, 15th) (Nanjing) Liu Zhennian telegraphed his office in Nanjing at Shenshi (3-5 PM) on the 14th, stating that his troops had complied with the order to cease military action and were respectfully awaiting the central government's handling. However, after the inspectors left the front lines, Han's troops resumed their attacks on his troops' position in Yecheng on the evening of the 13th, using heavy artillery, mountain guns, and trench mortars to bombard Yecheng relentlessly, causing countless casualties and damage to the people and houses. In addition to telegraphing Minister He Chen, he hoped that the central government would take effective measures to implement a halt to the attacks. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu told reporters today about the proposed solution to the Jiaodong issue: (1) Liu's troops must leave Shandong within a specified time; (2) The administrative power must be handed over first; (3) The Three Route Army will withdraw west of the Weihai River. He would obey all orders from the central government. However, Liu demanded that he leave Shandong at the same time as the Three Route Army, and he could go anywhere. However, due to the responsibility, if Liu does not obey the order to leave Shandong, he cannot sit idly by and watch the people of Jiaodong suffer in misery while he is in Shandong. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Special commissioner Fan Yuhuang of the Military Department and Zhang Shouqian, a member of the provincial government, went to Laiyang to inspect and returned to Jinan today. Fan said that the two armies in Laiyang are about ten li apart, and the outposts are at Shuigoutou, fifty li west of the city. Liu's army's plainclothes teams often clashed with the self-defense forces, but not with the provincial army. They went to Laiyang Gu [illegible character] from Pingdu on the 13th to inspect, but did not enter the city, and returned to Pingdu that night. They went to Jiaoxian by train on the morning of the 14th to return to Jinan. They have reported the findings of the investigation to the Military Department and requested instructions on whether to return to Nanjing, and paid a visit to Jiang Bocheng to report. Zhang said that the area near Laiyang, after being plundered by Liu's army, was a scene of desolation. When they passed by, old men and women blocked the road to ask Commissioner Fan for their children, and cried bitterly, asking the central government to resolve Liu Zhennian. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) A large band of over a thousand communists was discovered in Rizhao. They first confiscated the weapons of the Wangjia [illegible character] salt police, and then confiscated the firearms of the Yujiacun and other village militias, occupying more than ten villages. The county has telegraphed the province for assistance. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

According to the commander of Han's army, there will be no incidents within the territory, and the lives and property of foreigners will be properly protected. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Lichuan, the representative of Liu Zhennian stationed in Nanjing, visited He Yingqin on the 15th, reporting on the situation of Han's army launching a fierce attack on Yexian immediately after the investigators from the Military Department left the battlefield, and requesting a prompt halt.

<p>He Yingqin Cannot Enter Sichuan Due to Pressing Military Affairs Liu Wenhui Telegraphed Nanjing That There Will Be a Fierce Battle in Shunqing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain representative of the Sichuan army stated that recently the generals in Sichuan received a telegram from the Executive Yuan ordering a halt to military actions. They have drafted a plan to resolve the Sichuan issue, with all units uniting effectively, jointly convening a Suining Conference, reorganizing the Sichuan situation, and proposing plans such as breaking the defense zone system, unifying administration and finance, and reducing the size of the army. (Nanjing) He Yingqin cannot enter Sichuan due to pressing military affairs and plans to invite Yang Jie and Zhu Peide to go. Zhu has politely declined, and Yang has not yet expressed his opinion. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain banker who recently arrived from Chongqing said that the main force in the current Sichuan war is Liu Wenhui and part of Liu Xiang's forces, and the instigator is Luo Zezhou. Luo learned that Liu Wenhui had remitted a large sum of money last winter to purchase fighter planes, explosives, new machine guns, and other war materials to increase his strength. Most of the weapons have arrived in China, and some have been secretly transported to Chengdu, attempting to occupy the entire Sichuan. (It is reported that the strange aircraft in Luoyang are one of the new weapons purchased by Liu Wenhui.) Luo and others preemptively struck when Liu Wenhui was not yet fully prepared. As Liu Wenhui did not want to fight before his military equipment arrived, he showed some calmness, but he was by no means intending peace. Recently, remittances from Chongqing to Nanjing require a surcharge of three yuan per hundred yuan, and the cost in Chengdu is even higher. Sichuan students studying abroad are complaining incessantly. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sichuan Fellow Association in Nanjing submitted a petition to the National Government, requesting: (1) Strictly order all Sichuan armies to immediately cease military actions and impose punishment accordingly; (2) Strictly prohibit all Sichuan armies from collecting extra taxes and levies under various pretexts to finance their military; (3) Stop issuing transportation permits for military supplies to the Sichuan armies, and order the governments of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces to strictly prohibit the Sichuan armies from smuggling military materials into Sichuan to curb the source of the chaos. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenhui telegraphed the central government on the 13th, stating that Li's troops, originally stationed in Yingshan, have now advanced to Jingxi, Huxi, and Shuanggui Gucheng, which belong to Shunqing. Luo's troops, originally stationed in Wusheng, have now advanced to Qingju, Yingnan, and Xikou, which belong to Shunqing. They are still pressing forward step by step. The above-mentioned areas are all no more than 20-30 li away from Shuncheng. According to Chief Chen Wanren of the Shunqing garrison, Li and Luo's troops also include units of the 21st Army, wearing Li and Luo's flags, secretly assisting in the middle. Meng Yutian's brigade of Fan Shaozeng's division has advanced to Huanglianxu, 10 li away from Shunqing. Xu Kanqing of Wang Lingji's division is also advancing towards Shunqing from Yingshan, planning to join forces and attack Shunqing. If there are more conflicts within days, the situation will be even more intense. In this situation, Li and Luo rely on external support and disregard everything. Those who manipulate the Sichuan war are still going to extremes. Although he did not fire a single arrow, I am afraid it will be difficult to appease their anger. As a local official of the central government, he disobeys the central government's orders and unilaterally increases his forces. Now that the Executive Yuan has issued an order to stop the war, he turns a deaf ear and continues to press forward. Is he enjoying the chaos and misfortune? The central government will certainly see clearly. Furthermore, Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, and other division commanders of the 21st Army have recently issued joint telegrams, usurping many names and advocating the reformation of the Sichuan situation, which is ignoring the central government. In addition to waiting for the investigation and clarification, I still hope that the central government will investigate and take into account the report submitted by Hui [Liu Wenhui] and give strict sanctions to rectify discipline and uphold justice. Awaiting instructions. (Special dispatch, 15th) (Nanjing) Chongqing telegram on the 14th: (1) Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, and others of the 21st Army recently issued a joint telegram, advocating the reformation of the Sichuan situation. According to those familiar with the inside story, this is a prelude to the use of force, and peace is feared to be hopeless.

<p>(Jinan) At 9 o'clock this morning, the local court tried Zheng Jicheng's case. The judges present were Li Hongye, Li Guixun, and Zhou Peiji; the prosecutor was Zhu Zongran; the clerk was Zhang Piji. Zheng and his lawyers Zhou Qing'en, Sun Baifu, and Li Yunsheng, as well as police chief Bi Shizhen and police officer Cao Yuke from the Public Security Bureau, were also present. The courtroom was packed with spectators. First, Zheng was asked about the details of Zhang's murder. The prosecutor stated the reasons for the indictment and the indictment itself, and then debated the key points with the lawyers: (1) Zheng did not premeditate the murder; killing Zhang was a spur-of-the-moment act. (2) Liu Huaizhou's death and Liu Qingxun's injury were due to bullets different from those of Zheng and Chen Fengshan's guns; it was random gunfire, and Zheng cannot be held responsible. (3) Even if the two Lius were shot by Chen Fengshan, it was justifiable self-defense and not a crime. (4) Our country's foundation is based on morality; those who avenge their fathers have historically been exempt from punishment. Liu Zongyuan's rebuttal and the discussion of revenge are most popular. Moreover, Zhang was a counter-revolutionary leader and deserved to die. According to the Qing law, killing a person who deserved to die was not a crime. Although it cannot be invoked now, it should be treated leniently. Please reduce the sentence by one-third according to the law of voluntary surrender, and further reduce it by one-half due to extenuating circumstances. Also, please suspend the detention first. After three hours of debate, the judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled a public trial. Zheng was returned to custody. The request to suspend detention will be decided separately.

<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Boling hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at the Dahua Hotel on the evening of the 15th, reporting on the process of mediating the Shandong war after receiving a telegram from the General Assembly of the League for Abolishing Civil War. He said briefly that Han Fuju said that Liu Zhennian was holding power in Jiaodong, intercepting tax funds, and disobeying the provincial government's orders. As the chairman of the province, I naturally have the power to deal with it, but I should first report it to the National Government before launching a campaign. I now admit that there was an error in the procedure, but it is not a civil war, so there is no need for mediation. However, on the central side, there is another reason, saying that Liu is a central army, and the central government has the right to station troops. If a certain province does not want guest troops to be stationed within its borders, where should the central army be placed? I plan to ask Duan Qirui to come forward to mediate, so that his reputation may be effective. Duan has agreed to send personnel to Shandong. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Investigation Report to be Discussed Next Month</p>
<p>All Five Committee Members to Attend for Consultation</p>
<p>Geneva, Reuters, 14th - The League of Nations Administrative Council met this afternoon and elected Turkey as one of the members of the special committee of nineteen to handle the Sino-Japanese dispute, replacing Yugoslavia. Turkey received twenty-four votes out of thirty-eight. The Japanese representative did not vote in accordance with its decision in March. Turkey is a newly admitted country to the League of Nations, and since there is no Asian country participating in the special committee of nineteen, it was elected. All members of the League of Nations Administrative Council should be members of the special committee of nineteen, so Mexico will naturally replace Peru on the committee.</p>
<p>Geneva, Reuters, 15th - The League of Nations Administrative Council has invited the investigators of the Manchurian Incident, Lord Lytton, etc., to attend the meeting to discuss the investigation report. It is believed that this move by the Administrative Council is from the wishes of Lord Lytton, etc., and can enable them to explain the various points that the public wants to inquire about. American member McCoy will attend at the time, so the United States will actively participate in the handling of the Lytton report, which is very important. The other three members from France, Germany, and Italy will also attend.</p>
<p>London, Guomin News Agency, 14th - Lord Lytton described his experiences in investigating Manchuria on the radio, saying that the members of the League of Nations investigation team unanimously agreed on the main facts, and only had slight differences of opinion on the solution. He hoped that when the League of Nations discusses the case in the future, it can also show the same spirit of unity, and the power of the spirit of the League of Nations is enough to avoid the storms in the sky.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Increased Left-Right Ideological Crimes in Japan <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Social Order Greatly Shaken</p>
<p>Judicial Authorities Resolve to Crack Down Severely</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th Dispatch from the Japan News Agency: In light of the surge in crimes stemming from both left-wing and right-wing ideologies, the judicial authorities convened a conference of prosecutors and judges from the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office and the ideological divisions of local courts nationwide. The points discussed by the attending prosecutors and judges were as follows: (1) To prevent ideological crimes, severe crackdowns will be conducted on both left-wing and right-wing elements, and violations of the Public Order Maintenance Law will be punished severely. (2) Those who sympathize with ideological criminals will be subject to the same severe penalties as the principals. Tokyo dispatch from the China News Agency: Given the prevalence of radical ideologies within the country and the increasing intensification of left-wing and right-wing movements, which have greatly shaken social order, the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office and local courts throughout Japan held a joint conference of judges and prosecutors at 9:30 AM on the 10th of this month in the conference room of the Ministry of Justice. Minister of Justice Oyama began by instructing the attendees, stating that recently there has been an increase not only in crimes stemming from left-wing ideologies but also in crimes stemming from fascist right-wing ideologies. Both of these ideologies are causing unrest among the people. Those responsible for directly cracking down on these crimes should study ideological crimes in their respective areas of expertise and take appropriate measures to eliminate them. The discussion items were divided into the following three points: (1) In light of the trend of ideological crimes, how should the administration of ideological crackdowns be improved? (2) How should the correction and rehabilitation of ideological criminals be carried out? (3) How should the judicial disposition of publication crimes be improved? The Japanese judicial authorities are paying particular attention to the crackdown on left-wing and right-wing ideologies and movements, which reflects the rapid changes in the Japanese social economy and the sharpening of class struggle. At this juncture, the judicial authorities, representing the bourgeoisie and landlords, have no choice but to plan and prepare for even more severe crackdowns on radical ideologies and movements. Among them, left-wing communism and the communist movement are receiving particular attention from the Japanese authorities. In order to prevent the development of the communist movement, the Japanese government is not only mobilizing judicial judges and prosecutors but also mobilizing bourgeois sociologists Takada Yasuma, philosopher Kihira Masami, and political scientist Rōyama Masamichi on the same day to give lectures and assist the judicial authorities in achieving the goal of cracking down on ideological crimes.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Japanese Diplomacy Towards Russia <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Avoiding Suspicion from Other Nations, Refrains from Officially Concluding a Treaty</p>
<p>Instigates Traitors to Come Forward and Negotiate with Russia Indirectly</p>
<p>Hirota Will Serve as a Foreign Affairs Advisor for the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th Dispatch from Reuters: Japanese Ambassador to Russia Hirota has returned to Japan on leave and arrived here last night, greeted by a large crowd. According to various newspapers, Xie Jieshi will arrive here from Changchun on Sunday and is expected to hold important talks with the Soviet Ambassador and officials from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reportedly to discuss Soviet recognition of "Manchukuo" and other issues.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th Dispatch from the China News Agency: Bao Guancheng, the foreign affairs representative of the puppet organization, and Ōhashi Chūichi, the puppet vice-minister of foreign affairs, have been consulting with the Japanese government, military, and the Russian embassy in Tokyo for days regarding Russo-Japanese issues. Xie Jieshi, the puppet foreign minister, is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 17th, and Feng Hanqing, the puppet minister of justice, may arrive on the 20th. Hirota, the Japanese ambassador to Russia, entered Tokyo last night. They are proceeding separately to deal with the League of Nations' strategy. In order to avoid suspicion from France, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is unwilling to directly sign a non-aggression treaty with Russia. Russia fears being deceived by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and insists that it cannot recognize the puppet organization without signing a Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty. Japan, on the other hand, has sought understanding from Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy under the guise of opposing the Reds since the Manchurian Incident. Approaching Soviet Russia now would invalidate a year's worth of propaganda. Therefore, Japan cannot easily approach Russia and is instigating the puppet organization to sign a non-aggression treaty with Russia in order to escape this predicament. However, Russia still insists that a Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty must be concluded before any other issues can be discussed. The puppet Foreign Ministry and the Japanese ambassador to Russia advocate approaching Russia in order to break out of the difficult situation. Therefore, Japanese diplomacy towards Russia may change within ten days. Two major items regarding foreign affairs between the puppet state and Japan will be resolved in Tokyo: (1) the abolition of extraterritoriality and (2) the Japan-Manchukuo economic control law, including the issue of preferential tariffs. Japan has already decided to agree to the abolition of extraterritoriality and will be able to implement it next spring after dispatching a large number of Japanese judges to take office.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th Dispatch from the Electric Communication Agency: Regarding the highest advisors for military, diplomatic, and financial affairs of the puppet state, Lieutenant General Tsukushi has already been recommended as a councilor and appointed as a military advisor. However, a diplomatic advisor is still being sought. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently consulting with Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Ōhashi, who is visiting Japan. Foreign Minister Uchida initially considered Kobata Yūkichi, the current ambassador to Germany, as the most suitable candidate and intended to recommend him. However, Ambassador Kobata currently has no intention of returning home, and the matter was put on hold. Recently, Ambassador to Russia Hirota returned home yesterday and will be recommended as a councilor in Manchukuo and appointed as a diplomatic advisor. Since the most important aspect of Manchukuo's diplomacy going forward is its relationship with Russia, Ambassador Hirota, who has been stationed in Russia for many years and is familiar with Russian affairs, is the most suitable candidate. It is said that Ambassador Hirota has not refused the offer.</p>

The resolution also advocated establishing a new industrial policy to enhance economic relations between Japan and "Manchukuo." Suzuki, the president of the Seiyūkai, addressed the representatives, asking Japan to always act based on fairness and predicting that future policies would not change. Suzuki also criticized the major errors in the Lytton Report, saying that they were caused by a hasty investigation. The report did not provide a key to fundamentally resolving the Sino-Japanese problem. Suzuki believed that the League of Nations would not discuss a solution based on the Lytton Report, saying that the peaceful League of Nations would never adopt clumsy policies and continue to cause disputes. Finally, he said that no matter what attitude the League of Nations takes, Japan's policy will never change.</p>

<p>Stalinsk, 15th Dispatch from TASS: A Mongolian delegation of twelve people, eight men and four women, is visiting the Soviet Union. They spent three days in Stalinsk, visiting the steel plant, furnaces, coking plant, and hydroelectric power plant here. Before their departure, a farewell banquet was held by the local authorities. One of the representatives, Tserendorj (transliteration), delivered a speech at the banquet, stating that the Mongolian revolution of 1921 was a counterpart to the October Revolution in the Soviet Union. At that time, there was a fierce struggle between the old and new factions within the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and the latter emerged victorious. Since 1928, Mongolia's development has progressed smoothly. Tserendorj pointed out that the workers and peasants of Mongolia are now making every effort to reform the old system, and the nomadic life of the people will be completely changed. The collectivization of agriculture has been established. Previously, there were very few literate people, but now many men and women can read and write. Women are also active in social life. He continued to say that they had benefited greatly from their visit to the Soviet Union, and that future relations between the two sides would be further strengthened.</p>

<p>Insists That No Single Country Can Occupy Two Seats Among Senior Officials</p>
<p>Geneva, 14th Dispatch from Havas: With the resignation of Sir Eric Drummond, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, it has been decided that the Deputy Secretary-General, the French national Joseph Avenol, will succeed him. Germany has raised several proposals regarding the reorganization of the Secretariat. If none of these proposals are accepted, Germany will oppose Avenol's succession. The Fourth Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly has appointed a subcommittee composed of representatives from fourteen countries to be responsible for reorganizing the Secretariat. Germany's unease has increased due to the perceived cooperation between France and Italy in the subcommittee's work. Germany initially intended to obtain one seat among the two Assistant Secretaries-General, but the General Assembly decided to grant one seat to Italy and the other to small countries (such as Norway). Disappointed, Germany believes that it has been deceived by Italy. According to the rules of the League of Nations, the Secretary-General should be elected unanimously by all members of the Administrative Council, and Germany, as one of the members, has the power to oppose Avenol's election.</p>
<p>Geneva, 14th Dispatch from Havas: The 13th General Assembly of the League of Nations is nearing its end. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, it will adjourn tomorrow, as its political role has been exhausted. However, its final meeting could not be held due to complications regarding senior personnel. Eight days ago, the Budget Committee appointed fourteen people to form a subcommittee to resolve this difficult point. Since yesterday, Germany has taken the attitude of demanding that no two heads of departments in the League of Nations Secretariat be of the same nationality. If this demand is passed by the Second Committee, the senior personnel from France and Italy in the Secretariat, who have worked diligently since the establishment of the League of Nations, will be affected. The fourteen-member subcommittee's mediation was ineffective, and it appointed three members, namely Vasconcelos of Portugal, Hambro of Norway, and Osuský of Czechoslovakia, to seek other methods of conciliation.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Attacks German Police <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Claims They Have a Military Character</p>
<p>Belgian Representative Strongly Defends Germany</p>
<p>Geneva, 14th Dispatch from the National News Agency: Today, the French representative, Mr. Massigli, launched a major attack on the German police here. Mr. Massigli distributed many propaganda materials, including photographs and newspaper clippings from various countries, describing the German police's machine gun drills and military training. Massigli claimed that this was a violation of the treaty signed between Germany and the Allied Powers in 1925, which limited the number and strength of the German police. He also said that the peacetime defense force of Germany should include at least 140,000 police officers, or perhaps even more. After Massigli made this argument, the Belgian representative and advocate of peace, Mr. de Brouckère, challenged him, arguing that police in all countries now have military training and machine gun drills, not just Germany. This is because widespread riots and unrest occur frequently in all countries, and national police must have the ability to prevent them. The Belgian representative continued to say that the only way forward is to find a way to allow Germany to join the League of Nations' Disarmament Conference and grant it equal rights, so that it can discuss matters jointly with the major powers. The Belgian representative's remarks were completely unexpected by the French representative.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Four-Power Conference to Be Held in Geneva <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Italy Agrees, Germany Sternly Refuses</p>
<p>Until the Principle of Military Equality Is Recognized</p>
<p>Germany Indicates It Will Not Participate in Any Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Herriot Returns to Paris</p>
<p>London, 14th Dispatch from Reuters: A communique was released on Downing Street today, stating that "Yesterday and today, British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Prime Minister Herriot, and British Foreign Secretary Simon jointly discussed the difficulties encountered in the Geneva Disarmament Conference and the UK proposal to convene a four-power conference to resolve them. As a result, both the British Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister agreed that this conference should be attended by the aforementioned four countries and that Geneva would be the most appropriate location for the conference to be held. The British government has already sought the consent of Germany and Italy. The conference should be formal and preparatory in nature, with the aim of seeking to promote the continuation of the League of Nations Disarmament Conference." It is reported that when the British government sought the consent of the Italian and German governments, the Italian government immediately agreed, but Germany's rejection of the proposal was disappointing. The UK's original proposal was to hold the meeting in London, but this was later changed to Geneva. However, British officials believe that the location of the conference is not important and hope that Germany will not continue to firmly oppose it. British cabinet members are very satisfied with the exchange of views with French Prime Minister Herriot, which proves that both countries have the sincerity to promote the Disarmament Conference. However, the exchange of views between the UK and France cannot replace the work of the League of Nations or the Disarmament Conference. It is only intended to resolve the current difficulties encountered by the Disarmament Conference. Today, the German cabinet has approved Germany's rejection of Geneva as the location for the four-power conference. Officials also believe that Lausanne is not a suitable location for the meeting. Currently, people generally do not expect the four-power conference to be held after all.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th Dispatch from Havas: British Foreign Secretary Simon telegraphed Rome and Berlin last night, inviting the two governments to participate in a preparatory conference. Italy accepted, while Germany refused. Germany is so determined because it does not want the UK and France to lure it back into the Disarmament Conference by roundabout means. Even if this conference is held in a place other than Geneva, Germany will only agree to participate if the issue of equality of rights can be discussed as a whole. However, whether the conference is held here or there is only a superficial difference. The fundamental issue remains the principle of equality of rights. If this principle is not recognized in advance, Germany will never attend the Disarmament Conference again. Political circles have specifically stated that if the proposed meeting is aimed at demanding a political truce from Germany, it will be completely useless. Germany will reject any arrangement that would prolong the current situation or have the nature of an "Eastern Locarno" (referring to the re-recognition of the German-Polish border).</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th Dispatch from Havas: Although Germany has refused to participate in the four-power preparatory conference proposed by the UK to be held in Geneva, Germany may accept such a conference if it is held in The Hague or Luxembourg.</p>
<p>London, 14th Dispatch from Reuters: French Prime Minister Herriot returned to Paris this afternoon. Before leaving the UK, he said that he was very satisfied with his talks with British Prime Minister MacDonald and other British cabinet members, adding that "We discussed everything in a frank spirit, and we both reached sincere conclusions. In short, I can say that the result was very satisfactory."</p>

<p>London, 14th Dispatch from Reuters: Important negotiations between the British and Irish governments were held at the Cabinet Office this morning, discussing financial matters concerning land annuities and other payments, namely, those formerly paid by Southern Ireland to the UK but now suspended. The total amount is approximately £5 million per year, of which £2.1 million is permanent land annuities. The talks were suspended briefly at lunchtime and then resumed. They will be discussed again tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Buhl, Idaho, 14th Dispatch from the National News Agency: U.S. Senator Borah spoke here tonight, urging the world to restore silver as money so that the 800 million people in the East can use silver coins again, as they have for three thousand years. The current economic malaise and morbidity worldwide is largely due to the decline in silver prices. In order to achieve a complete economic recovery, silver must first be restored to its function as money. His proposal is not intended to implement bimetallism, but only to enable the 800 million people in the East, or half of the world's population, to use silver to purchase goods from the West. He believes that the next government, whether Republican or Democratic, should immediately convene two international conferences, one to discuss disarmament and the other to discuss economic issues. The current amount of money circulating in the world is insufficient for commercial use, while too much money is being spent on armaments. Therefore, these two issues should be addressed directly with firm determination, without regard to political considerations that may cause constraints.</p>

<p>To All Newspaper Offices in Hailar: A telegram was recently sent to the League of Nations, which reads as follows: "Entrusted by representatives of the people of various localities in the Northeast and supported by the generals of various armies, I, the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, assumed office as the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast People's National Salvation Army on October 1, the 21st year of the Republic of China [1932] in Hailar. Before mobilizing troops to eliminate violence, I hereby present to all friendly nations around the world the treaty violations and atrocities committed by Japan over the years, as well as the true intentions of our 30 million people. Japan, with an aggressive ideology, forcibly occupied Northeast China, coerced and held Puyi hostage under the guise of popular opinion, and organized the puppet state of Manchukuo. More than a year has passed since then. The Chinese people have unanimously opposed it, and the entire territory is mired in endless chaos. Despite stationing heavy troops, Japan has no ability to maintain law and order, and it has intensified its regressive actions, committing arson, murder, rape, and plunder, all kinds of atrocities. In addition to adhering to reason and humanity, at least three-quarters of the residents of the Northeast can no longer make a living. This action damages the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, violating Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty. Its failure to resolve disputes by peaceful means and its unauthorized use of force to disrupt peace violate Article 2 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. It also infringes on the political independence of members of the League of Nations, disregarding advice and ignoring covenants, simultaneously violating Articles 10, 12, and 13 of the League of Nations Covenant. The international community has delayed until now and has been unable to restrain or stop Japan's atrocities. The Chinese people cannot but take urgent and effective self-defense measures. Recently, Japanese warlords have even brazenly concluded a treaty of recognition with the puppet state of Manchukuo, monopolizing the resources of the Northeast and blockading international commerce. The situation in East Asia is about to face a major crisis. The people of Northeast China can hardly endure it. Japan has forced the puppet state to promote popular self-determination, governance by benevolent rule, openness, equality, co-existence, and co-prosperity as deceptive slogans to blind the eyes and ears of the world and to cover up its forcible occupation of the Northeast, further laying the foundation for permanent secession. Our people have never recognized these coercive and despicable actions from beginning to end. As soldiers, we are obligated to save the country. Based on the wishes of our 30 million people, we are mobilizing troops to the east to overthrow Japan's barbaric militarism, determined to liberate all the people, restore the territory, eliminate the puppet state, and establish peace. All our friendly nations should know that Japanese warlords not only harm China but also threaten foreign nationals. If they are not driven out, China and foreign countries will all feel threatened. Since the Japanese aggressive army and the Chinese bandit groups it has bought over are clearly unable to maintain the security of various cities, the Northeast is, from this day forward, only under the responsible authority of our People's National Salvation Army. All Chinese and foreign residents will be protected wherever our army goes. Anyone who obstructs our army's actions or acts as a tool of Japanese aggression, regardless of nationality, will not be protected. Furthermore, the Japanese people have not benefited from the Northeast Incident, but their burdens have increased, their economy has been plunged into panic, and unemployment is increasing day by day. They are also under oppression. In this case, our army is directly seeking freedom for the Chinese nation and indirectly removing tyranny for the Japanese people, as well as seeking lasting peace for all the nations of the world, so that the true intentions of our 30 million people in the Northeast can be revealed to the world and will not be slandered by violence. We also hope to unite with all those who are aware and striving for liberation to form a united front, attacking from both the front and the rear. This is a battle for the survival of the people of East Asia, and it is hereby proclaimed to the world. Respectfully submitted, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast People's National Salvation Army Su Bingwen, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang Dianjiu, respectfully sent and sealed."</p>

<h3 id="e83">Japanese Arbitrarily Incorporate <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yanbian into Korean Territory</p>
<p>Establish Jiantao Administrative District</p>
<p>Appoint Korean as Chief</p>
<p>Dalian Dispatch: The counties of Hunchun, Yanji, and Longjingcun in Jilin Province are located on the border between China and Korea and are adjacent to each other. In recent years, the number of Koreans coming to Yanbian to cultivate land has increased. Currently, the Korean population in Yanbian and other counties exceeds 400,000, while the Chinese population is less than three-tenths of the Korean population. In March of this year, the puppet state borrowed a large sum of 20 million yuan from Japan, on the condition that Yanbian be ceded. As a result, the Japanese seized all rights in Yanbian and began to incorporate Hunchun, Yanji, and Longjingcun into Korean territory, assigning them to an administrative district under the control of the Korean Governor-General's Office. In May of this year, the Governor-General dispatched Tanaka, the chief of the foreign affairs section, to reside in Yanji to prepare for the establishment of the so-called Jiantao Special Administrative District. All investigations, organizations, and police deployments are now in place. On the 8th of this month, Tanaka returned to Korea to report on his mission. The Japanese are now planning to relocate a large number of Korean people to eastern Jilin, adopting the so-called "collective immigration policy." The Korean Governor-General's Office has decided to appoint a Korean as the administrative chief of the Jiantao Special District. The Japanese's arbitrary seizure of our territory is clearly a violation of the integrity of our country's territory, and our diplomatic authorities should promptly protest it. (October 12th)</p>

<p>Foreigners Praise Them as Very Polite</p>
<p>Japanese Telegram Also Confirms No Killings or Looting</p>
<p>Intent Solely to Resist the Puppet State of Manchukuo</p>
<p>A Harbin dispatch from the North China Daily News on October 2nd states: "Every time newspapers announce that Japanese troops have cleared out bandits in a certain area, new incidents follow, worsening the situation and even making it far worse than before. Since April 26th, the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been closed to traffic, with only occasional trains running between Harbin and a section of the border, and never directly to Vladivostok. The Chinese soldiers' strategy of dispersing and ambushing is exhausting the Japanese troops. The southern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway has also been damaged, but train services rarely stop except during floods, and the attacks by Chinese soldiers in this section are far less intense than in the eastern section. Currently, each train is accompanied by three armored cars, with half of the guards being Chinese and half being Japanese, to ensure safe passage according to the new regulations. Passenger trains only run during the day, while freight trains can still run unimpeded at night. According to train passengers, stray bullets occasionally hit the train, but there have been no incidents of tracks being destroyed. After the flood subsided, the western section of the railway reopened, much to the relief of the business community, who hoped that transportation to Europe could be restored. However, within a few days, alarms came from Manchouli and Hailar, stating that the railway protection troops had rebelled, detaining all Chinese, Japanese, and Russian personnel related to the puppet Manchukuo government. This uprising was incredibly swift and astonishing. In less than a day, the railway from Manchouli to Fularji was entirely in the hands of the anti-government army. The puppet Manchukuo flags at all stations were torn down and replaced with old flags. Telegraph and telephone lines were cut. The purpose of this new movement was initially unknown, but it was later learned that it was aimed at resisting the puppet Manchukuo state. The anti-government army apparently had no conflict with the railway authorities, as trains were still able to pass. Yesterday morning, several foreigners took the train south to this city. According to them, the soldiers treated passengers very politely, but searches were very strict to prevent personnel related to the puppet Manchukuo state from blending in. The rumors of Chinese soldiers arbitrarily killing Japanese residents have also been denied. One passenger said that he personally saw the Japanese consul in Manchouli walking down the street. Although there were some robbery cases, they were very few. Overall, everyone agreed that the riot in Manchouli was quelled within two hours. Yesterday morning, news came from Harbin that the Chinese army was currently besieging Qiqihar. The general manager of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Lutkevich, ordered the trains from Harbin to Qiqihar to be temporarily suspended pending further orders because the telegraph and telephone lines to Qiqihar were suddenly cut. As a result, the western section of the railway has now been suspended again. The Japanese military mission claimed this morning that ordinary Japanese residents in Manchouli, Hailar, and Qiqihar were not harmed. This can correct the various wild tales of Chinese soldiers wantonly killing and looting reported in the local Russian newspapers. This matter has also been confirmed by a special radio telegram from the Toho News Agency. From this, it can be seen that the purpose of the Chinese soldiers' uprising is not to harm civilians, but to have other great ambitions."</p>
<h3 id="e85">Great Awakening in Fujian Business Circles <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Iron Blood Group Punishes Treacherous Merchants</p>
<p>Inferior Goods Burned at the Sports Field</p>
<p>A Fuzhou dispatch: "Inferior goods from a certain country are extremely prevalent in Fuzhou. Recently, enthusiastic people from society have organized the National Salvation Iron Blood Group, dedicated to dealing with treacherous merchants by force. The methods are divided into three steps: first warning, second ear cutting, and third assassination. Since the establishment of the group, the ears of Zhang Kangjian, the owner of Xiexing Cloth Shop, and Liu Yin, the owner of Tianji Cloth Shop, have been cut off, and Liu Yinghui, a foreign cloth broker, has been killed. On the evening of the eighth of this month, at around 8 p.m., Zhang Qiufan, the manager of the Guangdong Coal Mine in the Hexi Street area near the Pacification Commissioner's Office, was shot dead with a pistol. His crime was written in white powder on the wall of his house, accusing him of colluding with Taiwanese people, specializing in selling inferior coal and foreign cloth and opium, and ignoring warnings. The business community was greatly shocked. On the afternoon of the ninth, an emergency meeting of various merchant guilds was convened at the Chamber of Commerce, resolving to have each guild's shop automatically carry all the inferior goods from a certain country stored by them to the public sports field for burning at 12 noon on Double Ten Day, to show their determination to never buy or sell them again. If any more goods from a certain country are found afterward, they will be considered to be undermining the patriotic front and regarded as public enemies, and society will have to deal with them with the most severe means of dealing with enemies. On this day, over a thousand dan of inferior goods from a certain country were carried from various shops to the sports field for burning, piled up like a mountain. The smoke and flames filled the sky, and tens of thousands of spectators clapped and cheered. Each shop also posted slogans at the entrance stating that the inferior goods in their shop had been thoroughly cleared out and welcoming patriotic comrades to come inside for inspection, which shows the great upsurge of popular sentiment in Fujian Province."

<p>Amended and Passed by the Legislative Yuan</p>
<h3 id="e86">Banknote Issuance Tax Law <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The amended Banknote Issuance Tax Law, after being discussed by the Legislative Yuan last week and handed over to the Finance Committee to be jointly reviewed with the Economic Committee, was immediately discussed at a joint meeting of the two committees. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance attended to explain the law, and the case was amended and passed with the following suggestions: (1) Since banks must first obtain the government's special permission to issue banknotes before paying the banknote issuance tax to the government, the government should formulate a Banknote Issuance Law to provide a basis for granting special permission to banks to issue banknotes, and then draft a Banknote Issuance Tax Law based on the Banknote Issuance Law. Otherwise, banks that have obtained special permission from the government to issue banknotes will not have precise regulations on their issuance volume and procedures, which is inconsistent with the main objective of reorganizing finance and banking. Therefore, it is suggested that this Yuan recommend that the Central Political Council instruct the Ministry of Finance to quickly draft a Banknote Issuance Law and submit it to this Yuan for review. (2) The power to concentrate banknote issuance can only be achieved with a well-organized central bank. Item 5 of the plan to improve the financial system passed by the First Plenary Session of the Fourth National Congress states: "The central bank should be detached from the direct command of the Ministry of Finance to maintain its independent financial status. The president and vice president should be appointed from those with banking knowledge and experience, and should not advance or retreat with financial personnel, nor should they be concurrently held by government personnel." This is to ensure the soundness of the central bank's organization. Therefore, it is proposed that this Yuan recommend that the Central Political Council, based on the resolution of the Fourth National Congress, decide on the principle of instructing the Ministry of Finance to quickly draft a Central Bank Law as the fundamental measure for unifying banknotes in the future. It was submitted to the 206th meeting of the Legislative Yuan today (the 15th) for discussion, and it was resolved to pass the amended draft after review. The amended draft is as follows: Amended Banknote Issuance Tax Law (Article 1) Designated banks specially permitted by the National Government to issue banknotes shall pay banknote issuance tax in accordance with this law. (Article 2) The banknote issuance tax shall be paid uniformly, regardless of silver dollar notes or subsidiary coin notes. The aforementioned subsidiary coin notes shall be calculated at ten jiao to one yuan. (Article 3) Banks issuing banknotes shall have full reserve funds, with at least 60% as cash reserves and the remainder as guarantee reserves. The cash reserve portion shall be exempt from issuance tax. (Article 4) Banks issuing banknotes shall truthfully report the amount issued and the amount of cash and guarantee reserves separately in accordance with the monthly report form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance. The aforementioned reported amounts shall be registered separately by the Ministry of Finance on a monthly basis, and after one year, they shall be calculated based on the average of twelve months. (Article 5) The banknote issuance tax rate shall be set at 1.25% based on the actual amount of guarantee reserves. (Article 6) The banknote issuance tax shall be collected once at the beginning of each fiscal year based on the average of the previous year. (Article 7) Banks that are required to pay the banknote issuance tax shall, after receiving the collection notice from the Ministry of Finance, pay the tax to the local central bank within ten days for collection by their respective head offices, obtain a receipt, and report it to the Ministry of Finance for verification. (Article 8) If a bank fails to pay the banknote issuance tax in accordance with this law, the Ministry of Finance may, with approval, revoke its special issuance right. (Article 9) If the Ministry of Finance deems that the amount reported by a bank in accordance with Article 4 is not accurate, it may send personnel to inspect the issuance accounts and reserve fund accounts. If there is indeed concealment or underreporting, in addition to being ordered to pay the issuance tax, a fine of between 500 yuan and 3,000 yuan shall also be imposed. (Article 10) Banks issuing banknotes shall also pay the taxes due for the banknotes used by other banks, but they may recover the tax from the banks using the banknotes. (Article 11) This law shall take effect from the date of promulgation."</p>

<p>The Navy Department stated that the three types of naval regulations: Maritime Capture Regulations, Capture Review Office Regulations, and Rules for the Custody of Captured Objects by Naval Offices, were all promulgated separately in 1917. However, they have been in effect for a long time, and many of the wordings are no longer applicable today. However, these regulations are all related to international justice and should not be revised directly by the ministry. Therefore, a clean copy was prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan to be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for revision and promulgation separately for implementation. The Executive Yuan forwarded it to the Military Affairs Commission for review, and the Military Affairs Commission replied, stating that since these regulations are related to international justice, the esteemed Yuan is requested to consult with the Legislative Yuan for revision and</p>

<h3 id="e88">Chen Guohui's Troops Have Been Resolved <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Remaining Troops Fleeing Towards Dehua</p>
<p>A Fuzhou dispatch: "After Chen Guohui, the brigade commander of the First Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, was detained by the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Chen's five regiments, totaling more than 7,000 men, concentrated in Xianyou County, under the command of Chen Peiyu, the regimental commander of the Second Regiment, preparing to resist. The Pacification Commissioner's Office dispatched two regiments of Tan Qixiu's Provincial Supplementary Brigade to Yongtai County for defense. Zhang Yan, the deputy division commander of the 61st Division stationed in Quanzhou, led three regiments of Zhang Li's brigade and one regiment of the 60th Division stationed in Zhangzhou to Yongchun and Hui'an counties for defense, encircling them from three sides and ordering them to surrender. Cai Tingkai also personally went to Quanzhou to command. On the third, firing began in the Shuikou Fengding area of Yongchun. Chen's troops, relying on their familiarity with the terrain, stubbornly resisted, with Peng Tang, the regimental commander of the First Regiment, supervising the battle. Zhang's brigade used artillery bombardment. On the fourth, Peng Tang was killed in action by artillery fire, and the bandits collapsed. The 19th Route Army took the opportunity to pursue, and Chen's troops suffered more than a thousand casualties and captures, with more than 2,000 rifles and more than ten machine guns seized. The remaining troops retreating into Xianyou were intercepted by the militia and more than 1,000 rifles were seized. Upon hearing the news, the rear echelon knew that the situation was over. On the morning of the fifth, they retreated from Xixiang to Xingtai Li, fleeing towards Dehua, because that area has high mountains and steep terrain, and for more than ten years, it has been the base for bandits in the four counties of Xian, Yong, and De. On the afternoon of the fifth, Zhang Yan led troops from Nanxiang to enter Xiancheng. Merchants set off firecrackers to welcome them. Zhang immediately dispatched Zhang Li's brigade to advance towards the north of Xianyou to search for bandit traces. He stayed overnight and returned to Quanzhou, handing over local security to Chen Tong's regiment of Chen Wei'yuan's Third Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army. However, the people of Xianyou and Putian counties believe that Chen Wei'yuan's troops are also composed of bandits. When they were stationed in Xianyou before, they imposed exorbitant taxes and levies, which were no less than Chen Guohui's. The recent burning and killing of DongsHa village in Putian County is one example. They specifically elected representatives to go to Fuzhou and Zhangzhou to request Jiang and Cai to punish He Xianzhu, the deputy brigade commander of the Third Brigade, and to completely resolve the troops under his command, together with Chen Guohui's troops, in order to permanently relieve the suffering of the people of Xinghua."</p>
<p>Attached is the telegram from Zhang Yan and Zhang Li to Jiang and Cai reporting the defeat of Chen's troops: "Director and Commander-in-Chief, We received the order to lead our troops to Xianyou to monitor Chen's troops. Our army arrived at Motou Creek and followed orders to avoid conflict, hoping to allow them to surrender peacefully without alarming the neighborhood. However, Chen's troops had divided wills, and the rebellious ones were plotting. When Peng Tang saw us approaching, he opened fire first. We still strongly suppressed our soldiers and repeatedly enlightened them, encouraging them to strive forward. After two fierce battles at Fengding and Shuikou, the bandits scattered like birds and beasts, abandoning their weapons and baggage. Those injured and killed filled the pits and valleys. Our army, without fear of hardship, followed and pursued urgently, and captured more than 1,000 rifles and eight machine guns. The number of captives and those killed in battle totaled more than 1,000. The bandit Peng Tang was killed on the battlefield. Another unit was intercepted by the militia and also had more than 1,000 rifles seized. The rest scattered in four directions and are now being recruited and captured. The weapons seized by the militia have been ordered to be handed over to our troops in full for rewards. This is the general situation of Chen's troops' resistance and defeat. I, Yan, will return to Quanzhou to handle the aftermath of Huian County, and I, Li, will stay in Xianyou to handle the unfinished business of suppression and pacification.

<p>Record of the Interrogation of the "Little Taibao" Murder Case: Thirteen years ago, the Zhang Dongfu family in Baojia Bridge, west of the city, suffered the brutal murder of three women by Li Ting and others, a scene that is still vivid in memory. Only one murderer, Shen Aqin, was captured in the case, and after being interrogated by the county government, was executed by firing squad. The mastermind, Li Xingtang, nicknamed "Little Taibao," fled and was wanted. This spring, the criminal sneaked back to Shanghai and committed another murder case in the French Concession's Great World, was apprehended, and sentenced to eight years in prison by the Second Special District Court. The county court of this county dispatched police to escort him back to Songjiang for investigation. Today, Prosecutor Zhu opened the court for investigation, and witnesses Zhang Ren and others were summoned to testify. Other witnesses, Lin Feng, A Mei, Zhao Qinglong, etc., could not be summoned because their addresses were unknown. The court ordered Zhang Ren to find them and bring them to court. During the interrogation of the main suspect, Li Xingtang, he confessed: "I have always known the Zhang family and visited them from time to time. Because I failed to borrow 50 yuan from Zhang Dongfu's daughter, I held a grudge. I met Shen Aqin and talked about this matter, so we agreed to go together. Shen Aqin did it with a knife, and I was the one who came up with the idea, but I didn't do it myself," and so on. The court ordered him to be detained and wait for the witnesses to be summoned for further interrogation.</p>

<p>A Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits in Dongzhu: Lake bandits in Taihu Lake appear and disappear unpredictably. They are difficult to eliminate, and suppressing one leads to the rise of another. Although the military and police authorities have repeatedly suppressed them severely, it only treats the symptoms. Addressing the root causes requires huge expenses, and for thousands of years, it has not been realized. At 8 a.m. on the 13th of this month, Wang Zhaomin, the leader of the first squad of the second squadron of the county police stationed in Fanzhouzhuang, was ordered to patrol along the lake with twelve members of the second squadron of the 14th water police team. On the way, they received a report from villagers that thirty to forty lake bandits from Pudong were sailing towards Qingpu on three large boats and one small boat. The water police immediately led the way, trying to intercept them. At about 11 a.m., they arrived at Dongzhu Village, which belongs to Wujiang County, about two li from the border between Qingpu and Kunshan. They learned that the bandit boats were docked at Dongtan, so they rushed to the squad. They first encountered a small bandit boat with only hostages on board. They said that all the bandits were having lunch in a small temple on the shore. The water police landed and launched an encircling attack. The bandits also resisted with weapons. The water police were outnumbered and retreated to the boat, allowing the bandits to rush out and board the boat. At this time, the police arrived and took the lead, temporarily mixing and dividing into three teams, surrounding and attacking from the left, right, and center. The bandits still resisted stubbornly and also divided into three routes to meet the attack, fighting and retreating repeatedly. The fierce battle lasted until 1 p.m., with two bandits killed and about five or six wounded. The bandits could not hold out and fled towards Yushan Lake with their dead and wounded. In this battle, there were no casualties on the police side. They seized a small boat numbered Qingpu He 8890 and rescued three hostages: Li Shaoyun, Zhu Ma's, and Ren Falin. On the 15th, they were escorted to the third district of the water police here by the 14th team and notified the families of those kidnapped to come to Suzhou to claim them.</p>

<p>Hopes for Resolution of the Silk Factory Strike: The general strike of silk factories in the county has lasted for eight days, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. The arrival of He Yushu, director of the Industry Bureau, Li Mingyang, director of the Provincial Security Department, and Zhang Gongren, member of the Provincial Party Committee, the serious situation seems to have hopes for development. Yesterday, the Silk Factory Industry Association decided to have the seriously injured female workers go to court to verify their injuries and request legal aid due to the police's assault on the female workers. At the same time, they submitted a report to the county government requesting an investigation into the police officers who committed the violence. At 2 p.m., the association held another representative conference, resolving: 1. The agreed-upon points of dispute must be handled according to the original agreement before they can be accepted. 2. A representative conference will be held again on the 16th after the mediation meeting on the 15th. 3. The fault for this strike lies with the capitalists, and the wages during the strike period should be paid by the capitalists. 4. All members of the association and representatives attending from various factories should not be allowed to resign or publish their resignations because they deem the handling of matters difficult. At about 4 p.m., four seriously injured female workers, Zeng Fumei, Cao Afeng, Zhu Gendi, and Fu Sanmei, went to the county court to verify their injuries. Chief Zhou opened the court, ordered the clerks to verify the injuries, and ordered them to be sent back for review. At 8:04 p.m., He Yushu, Li Mingyang, Zhang Gongren, Jiang Nanchun, Yi Tingjian, and others, a group of six people, arrived in Wuxi on the fourth special express train going south. They immediately inquired in detail from County Magistrate Chen about the strike process. According to He, the mediation steps for the Wuxi strike have been determined. The first step is to separately summon the capitalists and workers one after another on the afternoon of the 15th to hold separate talks, inquire in detail about the factory's conclusions on the strike, and the current situation of the capitalists and the demands of the workers. The second step is to formulate a mediation plan that can be accepted by both parties based on the results of the separate talks and the possibilities of the facts and environment. The third step is to convene a joint mediation meeting of labor and capital to announce the formulated mediation plan and persuade both parties to accept it. According to Li Mingyang, when he first saw the report about the Wuxi strike, he suspected that there were reactionaries and other complex backgrounds behind the scenes. After sending personnel to Wuxi for investigation, he learned that the cause of the strike was very simple and there was no complex background, so he had changed his policy and decided to resolve it through peaceful means. As for sending troops to Wuxi, it was entirely to maintain local security. According to Zhang Gongren, the strike can be divided into two parts: legal and factual. From a legal point of view, the workers' sudden strike was a big mistake, but their insistence on the old agreement was not unreasonable. However, from a factual point of view, there were as many as 50 silk factories in Wuxi in the past, and there are still 24 that are closed, which shows that the situation of the capitalists is also difficult. The provincial government's handling of the strike should replace the old agreement under the principle of taking into account the interests of both labor and capital, but work must be resumed first before negotiations can be held. The two points that the workers did not make legal demands and suddenly went on strike, and that the treatment of each factory was different and there were no standards, are regrettable to me. At about 12 p.m., five companies of the first battalion of the third regiment of the Provincial Security Force, led by Regiment Commander Li Changjiang and Battalion Commander Yang Wei, arrived in Wuxi by train and were stationed in Nan Shui Xian Temple, Zhang Yuan Temple, and Xi Shui Xian Temple. Today, they have sent teams to patrol inside and outside the city. It is also heard that there is hope for resumption of work today (the 16th). It is also reported that He Yushu, director of the Industry Department, convened a meeting of capitalists at the Railway Hotel yesterday morning to exchange opinions. In the afternoon, the Silk Factory Industry Association held a general meeting, and He Yushu attended and urged the factories to start work. In the afternoon, the Silk Factory Workers' Union held a meeting, and Li Mingyang and Zhang Gongcheng went to give instructions. The workers on the spot requested the restoration of the labor-capital agreement. Li and others instructed the workers to submit it in writing. This morning, after considering the opinions of both labor and capital, a mediation plan has been determined. A mediation meeting will be held in the afternoon, and work will officially resume tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Jingzi Port Police and Bandits Open Fire: Recently, lake bandits have become rampant again. Shen Gaozhen, the commander of the second and third water police districts, ordered each team to unite and block them. The Zhaowu security ship and the Su Er patrol ship of the second district were towing three patrol boats and patrolling in Dianshan Lake when they encountered four bandit boats. As soon as the bandit boats saw the patrol ship, they sped away towards Xiaogang. The Zhaowu ship opened its engine and gave chase, but Xiaogang was too shallow to advance, allowing them to escape. At the same time, Captain Pei Xuan of the seventh team also personally led the patrol boat and patrolled to Jingzi Port when he encountered the bandits. The bandits resisted and opened fire. Soon, the bandits were overwhelmed and fled. As a result, they intercepted a bandit boat and rescued a female hostage surnamed Pan.</p>
<p>A Bizarre Murder Case in a Desolate Grave: Wu Jiquan, a resident of the Ten-Room Workshop at 5th Guangqin Road, Zhou Shanbang, outside the North Gate, had an argument with his concubine, Ms. Feng, the day before yesterday (the 14th) over a pawn ticket. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Ms. Feng suddenly hanged herself from a tree in a nearby desolate grave. However, observing the circumstances, it did not seem like a suicide. After Wu Jiquan learned about it, he reported it to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge and instructed the map chief to report it to the county court, requesting them to send someone to investigate.</p>
<p>Notorious Escaped Bandit Li Chengguo Executed by Firing Squad: The notorious bandit Li Chengguo was arrested in January 1930 for robbing three families, including Wu Yuemao. The former County Magistrate Sun Zuji approved the report to the provincial government. On March 15th of that year, he was ordered to prepare for execution by firing squad. Unexpectedly, Li escaped from prison the day before and disappeared. The county issued a wanted notice. Last month, Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the county water patrol team, captured him in Shanghai and escorted him to Wuxi. County Magistrate Chen approved the report to the provincial government and verified his identity at 10 a.m. yesterday (the 15th) before escorting him to the South School Field for execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>Nine Counties Jointly Suppress Lake Bandits: Wujin, Wuxi, Changzhou, Wuxian, Qingpu, Kunshan, Changshu, Yixing, Songjiang, and Jinshan counties formed a joint defense zone office in Wuxian for the sake of jointly protecting public security, and the county magistrates of each county served as commanders. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the office held its fifth joint defense meeting in Wuxi. More than ten people, including the county magistrates, public security bureau chiefs, water police district chiefs, and representatives from each county, attended. Zheng Jing, chief of the Wuxian Public Security Bureau, presided over the meeting and reported on the purpose of the meeting and the recent defense situation. The situation of each county's security was reported, followed by discussions on joint defense issues. With winter approaching, the future of security is extremely important, and teams should be allocated to jointly prevent and control. The resolutions of the previous meeting must be implemented, and the counties must jointly patrol. Next, the proposals of each county were discussed. Wuxian proposed that strict precautions should be taken against refugees entering the country, fearing that they would disrupt public security, and strict measures should be taken. Other counties proposed that the water and land police teams of each county along the lake must conscientiously suppress the lake bandits. There were many cases, but they were not announced due to defense matters. The meeting adjourned at 2 p.m. It was also heard that the next meeting will be held in Wujin.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editors of your newspaper:</p>
<p>Having read your publication's record of a Reuters Guangzhou dispatch of the 10th, which briefly stated that after the arrest of Chen Guohui, commander of the First Brigade of the Guangdong Provincial Defense Army, provincial military generals He Xianzhu and Lu Xingbang, among others, had made blatant expressions of opposition to the 19th Route Army, this is completely inconsistent with the facts. This division is a centrally-administered unit, and all actions are in accordance with central orders and the direct command of Zhuang, the Pacification Commissioner of Fujian. The Guangzhou Reuters dispatch is clearly due to outsiders' lack of understanding of the situation. Such spreading of misinformation affects military affairs and is of great importance. In addition to telegraphing the Military Affairs Committee Chairman Jiang to strictly prohibit this and issuing a public statement, we are writing to your newspaper to request a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lu Xingbang, Commander of the New Compilation of the Army Second Division</p>

<p>China Scores 24 Points, England 21 Points</p>
<p>The Championship Will Be a Fierce Competition Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>｜The Meet Breaks Five Chinese Men's and Women's Track and Field Records｜</p>
<p>｜Only Zhuang Mingzhen of Our Country Sets a New Women's Long Jump Record｜</p>
<p>The Third Shanghai International Sports Meet opened yesterday at the China Athletic Field with the majestic sound of military music. British athletes, with their outstanding performances, immediately scored twenty-one points in two events. Although China scored three more points, their hopes for the championship are slim. The British athletes performed exceptionally well in the short-distance races. It seems that the Chinese athletes cannot reach them. The preliminary rounds of the 100 meters, the top times in both groups, were 11.3 seconds, won by British athletes. In the 1,500 meters, British athletes took the top four places, with a time of 4 minutes and 21.4 seconds, a result never before seen in our country, except for an informal record of 4 minutes and 15 seconds incidentally set by Yu Xiwu. The British athlete Aker's time of 52.2 seconds in the 400 meters, the British athlete Warrell's time of 16.4 seconds in the high hurdles, and the American woman Burnett's high jump of 1.39 meters are all records never before seen in our country. Fortunately, Ms. Zhuang Mingzhen's long jump of 4.65 meters set a new record. The men's results this time are all remarkable. There will be fierce competition for the team championship between China and England. It is expected that both sides will go all out in today's finals.</p>
<p>The Opening Parade:</p>
<p>The competition was originally scheduled to begin at 1:45 PM, but the team parade did not begin until 2:00 PM. All the athletes and staff lined up behind the 100-meter starting line and paraded around the venue, led by the McInnes Military Band. Following the band were all the staff, then the women athletes from England, the United States, and China, followed by the male athletes from England, Russia, Japan, the United States, and China. The band played beautiful music, and the pace was steady. The whole venue erupted in thunderous applause, creating a magnificent scene. After circling the venue, they returned to the 100-meter starting line, and the competition began. It was already 2:15 PM.</p>
<p>The Audience Was Not Enthusiastic:</p>
<p>Yesterday's audience was only a little over a thousand before 3:00 PM. After 3:00 PM, the two sides of the north end of the stands were slightly crowded, with men, women, old, young, and people of all colors. It was estimated that there were about two thousand people, but it was not very enthusiastic. It is expected that today's program will be full of finals, and the interest will be even stronger, and the audience will definitely be lively.</p>

<p>If Chinese Athletes Do Not Strive, It Will Be Difficult to Have Hope</p>
<p>Before the International Sports Meet, everyone expected that China could steadily win the championship. In terms of predictions, they emphasized China and the United States. Little did they know that the American star Swank (the individual champion of the previous tournament) has now retired, and the performance of athletes such as Thompson Slaughter and Allard have greatly declined. Now that the United States has no special strengths, China's hope of retaining the championship seems greater. Who knew that England, which has always been weak, would show extraordinary performance this year, with great arrogance? Although the number of people is small, their performance is outstanding. Yesterday, they swept the top four places in the 1,500 meters and won the first place in the 400-meter relay. Their scores have reached twenty-one. Moreover, in the preliminary rounds of the 100 meters, 200 meters, and 400 meters, not only did they get the top scores, but their strength was also great, and there was much hope. Although China's total score was three points higher than England's yesterday, the situation is very dangerous. In addition, the Russian athletes' throwing army is also a major concern for China. Therefore, the championship of this competition will be contested by China and England. Even in individual events, China's score may not be less than England's. However, China's hope for the two relay races is extremely small. If England wins the 800-meter and 1,600-meter relay races, then China will be hopeless. An investigation revealed that most of the British athletes are from the Lancashire Regiment of the Shanghai Garrison. Since our country cannot win a place in the world arena, if we cannot steadily win the championship in the Shanghai International Sports Meet, what else can we say? Fortunately, I hope that our Chinese athletes will work hard to maintain the slight position of our country's track and field.</p>

<h3 id="e106">General Review of Yesterday's Track and Field (Liao) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday there were a total of five track and field events for men and women. There were three for men, and our athletes won two first places. There were two for women, and the United States and China shared the championship. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e107">Discus Final <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Leng Peigen Lacks Experience</p>
<p>It was expected that there would be many discus throwers from the United States and Russia. Whether China could score points in the competition was considered beyond consideration. Therefore, at the time of registration, it was already calculated that Wang Jihuai, etc., would be reassigned to other events, and only Leng Peigen and Li Zier participated. Unexpectedly, the result of yesterday's competition was unexpected. The best result was only 34.89 meters, which was not as good as Leng Peigen's result in our country's preliminary round. Moreover, none of the Russian and American athletes who participated in the discus throwing had the correct throwing posture. They relied on their tall and strong physique. According to the score of 34.89 meters, it would not have been difficult for Leng Peigen to win the championship. Unfortunately, due to lack of experience, he often showed rapid breathing and panic at the time of throwing, resulting in a retreat to third place. There is one thing to offer to Mr. Leng: You have a naturally rich physique for throwing heavy objects. You should study the scientific methods of throwing heavy objects in detail. The speed of your discus throw is too fast when you start to turn, and your body is prone to lose balance. It should be modified. According to the scientific method of throwing the discus, the discus should be like a wave in a circle, starting from a downward curve and ending with an upward curve in the third wave. The discus should not be too fast on the downward curve. The speed should gradually increase on the upward curve in the second wave. If Mr. Leng can pay attention to this point, he will be able to enter the hall and enter the room in the future. I hope Mr. Leng will encourage him. The results of the four finalists are as follows:</p>
<p>First: Molotov (Russia) 34.89 meters</p>
<p>Second: Warwick (USA) 34.74 meters</p>
<p>Third: Leng Peigen (China) 33.80 meters</p>
<p>Fourth: Motovki (Russia) 33.65 meters</p>
<h3 id="e108">Long Jump Final <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jihuai Unleashes Years of Resentment</p>
<p>Our country is full of long jumpers. Before the competition, it was known that it was our home field. However, the participants were still cautious and careful to prevent the story of the long jump at the International Sports Meet last year from happening again. According to the International Sports Meet last year, the long jump was entirely taken over by our country. At the last person, the national flag of our country was still hanging high on the flagpole in all directions, one, two, three, four, to show that our country had won a complete victory in this sport. Unexpectedly, in the last jump, the American Swank unexpectedly emerged as a dark horse, surpassing the scores of each person. From fifth, he won the final victory in one fell swoop. Wang Jihuai, who was originally the first, only had to advance to second place, and even the large silver cup could only be watched by Mr. Shi. It can be said that he had no words to say. Therefore, he was particularly careful in the competition this year. Unexpectedly, after six jumps, he hit a snag again. Wang Jihuai tied with the American Humphrey for first place with a score of 6.49 meters. It can be said that good things are hard to come by. However, according to the rules of track and field, there is no tie for first place. Each person must jump again to determine the order of the rankings according to the merits of one jump. Wang Jihuai's eyes were on fire. He used his life's strength to make a surprising jump. Sure enough, he lived up to the expectations of thousands of spectators in the stadium, overpowering Humphrey with a score of 6.69 meters. The resentment of the long jump failure last year has now been written off in one stroke. The results of the four are as follows:</p>
<p>First: Wang Jihuai (China) 6.49 meters</p>
<p>Second: Humphrey (USA) 6.49 meters</p>
<p>Third: Hao Chunde (China) 6.41 meters</p>
<p>Fourth: Sun Hupei (China) 6.31 meters</p>
<p>First and second are exceptional finals. Wang once jumped 6.67 meters, so he won first place, but the result is not counted.</p>
<h3 id="e109">High Jump Final <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Ling Hongzhao Wins the Championship</p>
<p>Only nine people attended the high jump final. Among them, the postures of Ling Hongzhao, Gu Hu, Wu Jinqi of our country, and Guhe of Japan were more suitable. The rest of the postures were not suitable. Even the rolling style jumped by Li Lin of our country was not well researched, so it failed. As a result, although our country won the first, third and fourth seats, it can be called a complete victory, but Wu Jinqi was too disappointing. Not only could he not win the first place and create a new record, but he retreated to fourth place, defeated by Gu Yu and Wazi. The score was only 1.715 meters. Looking at Wu's legs, there was no strength at all. Compared to the Wu Jinqi of the past, it was like two different people. I wonder what the story is.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Women's High Jump <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Burnett Retains the Championship</p>
<p>According to the order, there were only six women who joined the women's high jump. Later, with the permission of the referee, Misses Thomson and O'Kelly of England were temporarily allowed to join. Looking at each person's skills, there was no method to speak of. Last year's champion, American Ms. Burnett, relied on her naturally exquisite figure to retain the championship. The result was 1.39 meters, an improvement of 0.01 meters compared to her own result last year. This is an unprecedented record in our country. Although the British woman Thomson won the third place, it was not that the elasticity was not developed, but that she lacked training. According to Thomson's elasticity, it can be the crown of the whole body. If she can get proper training, then Burnett is far from her opponent. Ms. Zhuang Mingzhen of our country has a natural talent for jumping, but unfortunately, she has not mastered the speed of running and the rotation of the body when crossing the bar. In addition, the two women Li Baohui and Luo Yixue also lacked suitable methods. I hope they will work harder in the future.</p>

<p>Zhuang Mingzhen Raises Eyebrows and Exhales</p>
<p>Since Shanghai has had the International Sports Meet, women have joined the competition. In the long jump event, our Chinese have never won the top championship once. According to the results of this year's women's preliminary rounds, it is disappointing again. Therefore, everyone thought that the yellow-haired girl Burnett would steadily sit in the top seat again. Unexpectedly, the result of the competition was unexpected. Ms. Zhuang Mingzhen did not disgrace her mission and ate Burnett with a score of 4.65 meters, raising her eyebrows and exhaling for our Chinese women.</p>
<p>First: Zhuang Mingzhen (China) 4.65 meters</p>
<p>Second: Burnett (USA) 4.64 meters</p>
<p>Third: M Thomson (England) 4.50 meters</p>
<p>Fourth: Qian Xingxiu (China) 4.355 meters</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Situation of the Track and Field Duel <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's track and field finals, only the 1,500 meters and the men's and women's 400-meter relay races were dominated by British athletes, and our army was far inferior.</p>
<h3 id="e113">1,500 meters <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>British Athletes Take the Top Four Places</p>
<p>A total of thirteen people participated in the 1,500-meter final. Dong Jiaxie was the only athlete in China who had hope. After the start, the Chinese athletes were eliminated. Although Zhu Shaohua tried to take the lead and ranked second, he was also eliminated after one lap. Only the British and American athletes were competing for victory. After the second lap, the British Kennatai led by about two meters. The British Bessatto followed closely behind. The American child Sutton tried to chase, and the situation was good, but the pace seemed to be softer. By the last 200 meters, the rankings were largely determined. Bessatto took the lead and ran straight to the end, winning the championship by six or seven meters. The time was only 4 minutes and 21 seconds and 5/2, which is not as good as the official record in China. The British athletes continued to reach the finish line one after another, taking the top four places, which shocked the audience.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Women's 400-meter Relay <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Women Strive to Achieve</p>
<p>Everyone thought that China would definitely fail in the women's 400-meter relay. Little did they know that as a result of the competition, the Chinese athletes took the lead all the way and ran straight to the end, winning the championship with a time of 58 seconds. The United States was second and England was third. The reason why the British and American athletes failed was that their talents were uneven and they lacked training. The order of the four Chinese athletes is as follows: (1) Qian Xingxiu, (2) Zhuang Mingzhen, (3) Chen Baoxiang, (4) Liu Jingfang.</p>
<h3 id="e115">400-meter Relay <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>England Overwhelms China</p>
<p>Although our country has short-distance running stars such as Wang Jihuai, Hao Chun, Peng Guangxin, and Fu Jincheng, they are no match for the British athletes. The British took the lead in the first leg. China was three or four meters behind. They competed with each other. The British athletes were mighty and powerful, and ran straight to the end, taking only 46.2/10 seconds. The second place was China, three or four meters behind. The third place was Russia, and the fourth place was Japan. The United States was eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Brief Description of the Preliminary Results <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>In the preliminary rounds of the 100 meters, China and England each took three places, but the first places in both groups were British athletes, and the times were also 11.3 seconds, one for Warrell and one for Hurst. The Chinese athletes were not as good. Wang Huai and Hao Chunde each took second place. It is difficult for our country to win the first and second places in today's final.</p>
<p>In the two groups of the 200 meters, Fu Jincheng of China was the best with 23.3 seconds, but Horry and Smith in the second group seemed to have not exerted their power. Hurst, who ran 11.3 seconds in the 100 meters, was overpowered by Fu. In today's final, if Fu Jincheng, the only remaining Chinese fruit, can maintain the result of 23.3 seconds, he should be able to win the championship.</p>
<p>The British Aker set a record of 52.2 seconds in the 400 meters, which has never been seen in our country. His posture and pace are excellent. The Chinese athletes cannot reach him. In today's final, China will at most only get the third or fourth place.</p>
<p>High Hurdles: This competition is considered to be China's special strength, and Chen Ling, who has a new national record, is even stronger. Little did they know that the British 100-meter runner Warrell also boasted to people with a score of 16.4 seconds, not letting Chen Ling and Li Men in front. Although Chen did not develop as much as possible yesterday, it is difficult for China to insure the championship in today's final. Xiao Dinghua kept the original time of 17 seconds, which is enough to compete with Warrell Chen Ling.</p>
<p>Intermediate Hurdles: In the preliminary rounds of this event, the three Chinese athletes Chen Ling, Tao Yingjie, and Guo Zhixin all had special performances. The American and British athletes were eliminated. Only the Russian Koguf and Brook of the open group were selected, which is not the enemy of China. The most characteristic result of the preliminary rounds was Chen Ling with 60.3 seconds. In today's final, all three Chinese athletes can be selected and can even take the top two places.</p>

<p>Dai Chieh Visits the Site to Observe: Garrison Commander of the Shanghai-Woosung Area, Mr. Dai Chieh, along with Mr. Guo Dehua, arrived at the venue even before the opening ceremony. From the commencement of the parade onwards, both gentlemen were seated in the VIP area, enjoying the competitions with great enthusiasm. Their interest was particularly keen, and they only departed as the day drew to a close, demonstrating their fervent support.</p>
<p>Military Music Uplifts Spirits: The U.S. Navy's Marines Band, renowned at sea, made a special appearance yesterday to perform. Their presence was stately, and their musical skills were superb. The resonant sounds invigorated the entire venue, sparking significant interest among the audience.</p>
<p>Zhuang Mingzhen's Jump: Ms. Zhuang Mingzhen, the female long jumper, although awarded first place with a score of 4.65 meters, had once jumped to around 4.70 meters. Regrettably, her shoe slightly extended beyond the take-off board, leading a foreign referee to declare it a fault. In reality, such a minor overlap should not have constituted a fault. Shen Kunnan argued vehemently with the foreign referee, but to no avail. Consequently, the 4.70-meter record was not realized. Alas!</p>

<p>7-1 Triumph Over Lancashire</p>
<p>With More Accurate Shots, It Could Have Been at Least a Dozen</p>
<p>| A Scene from the Group A Football Match |</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Jinan Football Team decisively defeated the British Lancashire team by a score of seven to one at the Recreation Ground football field. This marks Jinan's second consecutive major victory in the Group A league. Jinan had previously lost to Lancashire 2-3 in a friendly match, making this complete revenge, a resounding victory, particularly unexpected.</p>
<p>Perfect Coordination, Poor Shooting: Jinan's teamwork yesterday was truly flawless. The coordination of the five forwards was remarkably smooth, their incursions into the enemy's territory were exceptionally sharp. However, their shooting accuracy was lacking, with countless missed opportunities in front of the goal. Had their shooting been more precise, they could have scored over a dozen goals.</p>

<p>A Resounding Victory: Jinan Scores Five Goals in the First Half: Only Three Minutes After the Game Started, Heavy Rain Poured Down: Jinan's athletes continued to attack in the rain. Liu Zuni advanced from the left wing, and Chen Zhenxiang scored with his incoming ball, just five minutes into the game. Jinan continued to attack relentlessly. Mei Hongbao sent the ball to the center, and Liu Zukan chased after it, adding a final kick. In an instant, Jinan led 2-0. An amusing incident then occurred: Luo Haiguang shot from over 20 yards away from the goal. The right defender, Mike Tao Hui, raised his foot to deflect the ball, but unexpectedly kicked it into his own net. With the score now 3-0, Chen Zhenhe and Luo Haiguang each scored a goal, making it 5-0 at halftime.</p>
<p>A Penalty Goal Leaves Some Dignity: Jinan Still Dominates in the Second Half After Switching Sides: Chen Zhenxiang scored another goal, but it was ruled offside. Lancashire advanced to Jinan's goal, and Liang Shutang attempted to stop Jizhi, inadvertently touching the ball with his hand within the penalty area. A penalty was awarded, and Liu Qiaosheng scored one goal for Lancashire, making it 7-1 at the final whistle. Mei Hongsai and Chen Zhenxiang each scored once. The starting lineups for both teams were as follows:</p>

<p>| A 4-7 Defeat |</p>
<p>A Westerners' League Group A Match</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yoyo Football Team played against the French Businessmen's team at the Baseball Field in a Westerners' League Group A match. After a fierce 90-minute battle, Yoyo lost 4-7. The referee was He Chunhui.</p>
<p>An Auspicious Start: This year marks Yoyo's first participation in Group A. The team comprises many veteran players, as well as several promising newcomers. Therefore, their performance has been quite commendable. The match against the French Businessmen's team was closely contested. However, their shooting accuracy was lacking, and they missed numerous opportunities. Otherwise, the outcome of the match would have been unpredictable. Yoyo started strong, with the entire team attacking. Mao Honggui sent a long pass, and Dong Xiaopei, displaying the skills he used to vie for supremacy in Nanyang with John, unleashed a powerful kick, breaking through the goal. However, in the blink of an eye, the opponents counterattacked, capitalizing on a free kick. Lei Ji'er seized the opportunity and scored. With each team scoring one goal, the game was tied after just five minutes.</p>
<p>The Goalkeeper's Liability: Liang Guanlian, who once made a name for himself in Shanghai, has been in retirement for a long time, and his skills have deteriorated. Most of the seven goals conceded yesterday were due to the goalkeeper's errors. Once he regains his proficiency, he should be able to restore his former glory. After 15 minutes, Yoyo was under considerable pressure. Although Zhu Mao Honggui and Lu Shifang defended staunchly, they could not stop the opposing attacks. Liang Guanlian panicked and conceded two more goals. Soon after, Yoyo's Dong Xiaopei made another solo run, scoring a goal. At halftime, the score was 3-2 in favor of the French Businessmen.</p>
<p>A Significant Loss of Energy: Although the final score indicates a clear winner, the overall game was evenly matched. However, due to poor luck, Dong Xiaopei's two attempts were unsuccessful, while the opposing team scored three consecutive goals, making the score 6-2. From then on, Yoyo's morale plummeted, and they struggled to recover. Yoyo's players fought back valiantly, attacking from all sides, making the situation tense. Dong Xiaopei and Shen Baigui each scored a goal, making the score 6-4. In the end, the French Businessmen scored another goal, resulting in a 7-4 victory.</p>

<p>Swap Market Weak</p>
<p>Swap Prices Were Lowered: Because the Gold Exchange held the swap market one day earlier yesterday, it opened for business at 8:00 AM this morning. However, brokers had already started trading before the opening, and the swap prices were still lowered by the shorts, with the gross price estimated to be around 3.5 taels. It then rose to 3.7-8 qian. When trading started at 3.65 taels, longs were willing to swap out, gradually reducing the price, with the final price being 2.2-3 qian. Longs and shorts both had transactions. However, the situation was relatively calm, with no activity in the November contract. The opening price was 733.25 taels, and the closing price was 29.2 qian, a decrease of 3.3 taels compared to the previous day. This was due to the shift to the December contract.</p>
<p>December's Market Was Ordinary: Yesterday, the December contract went on the market, but the situation was mediocre and slightly weak, remaining below 730 taels. From morning to noon, the price difference was only a few qian, and brokerages and speculators did not engage in large transactions. The initial opening was neither good nor bad. Although silver bars fell, forward prices still rose. Foreign cotton and foreign stocks had already surged. Foreign exchange was being extended, and demand in the market was not smooth, while sellers seemed active, frequently lowering prices. However, the Central Bank widely purchased spot goods, totaling about 700 bars, priced at 28 to 28.5 taels. Dadecheng, Tongfeng, Yongtai, and Kangrun sold these to offset forward contracts. However, it was heard that delivery was limited to November and December. The market price was not particularly favorable. Due to the market being closed on Saturday and the complex conditions during the week, the price fluctuated around 30 taels. The overseas silver market had slight fluctuations from time to time, with the lowest price on Tuesday being 727 taels and the highest price on Wednesday being 736 taels. The entire week saw a fluctuation of only 9 taels. Looking back, the result was slightly higher than the previous weekend, by 1.1 qian. The situation for yesterday morning is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Market Fell Roughly Over Three Taels in Half a Day: At 8:00 AM, the December contract opened at 729.6 taels, followed by 9.8 qian. Big bars contracted by one-eighth to one-sixteenth. The official telegram for the silver price did not change, but private telegrams added one-sixteenth. It was learned that foreign prices had risen sharply, and the price immediately fell further, fluctuating around 3 taels. Yuan Mao, Yong Zhaofeng, Chang, Hong Kang, Yong Yi, Feng Yongzhi, and Feng Yong all sold off, and by 8:30 AM, the price was 26.3 taels. Then, China-Belgium Bank bought January British gold at 1.9375 and November U.S. dollars at 0.50. Dadecheng, Yongfeng, Heng Yu, Qian Chang, Xiang, Heng Xing, and Yuan Tailai raised the price by 2.0 taels, but there was still a price difference of 1. At 9:20 AM, the price was 28.5 taels. When HSBC posted that British gold was up 1.25 and U.S. dollars were up 0.25, the price was 7.9 qian. However, the domestic market remained stable. HSBC absorbed 0.50 November U.S. dollars, and the Central Bank opened spot goods, immediately setting the price at 8.3 qian. Zhaofeng Chang, Futai Heng, Heng Xing, Sen Chang, Xiang, Hong Kang, and Yong all sold off, suppressing the price by 1.9 qian. At 9:45 AM, the price was 7.3 qian. It was suddenly heard that the Central Bank was absorbing cash again, and Qian Chang Xiang, Tai Kangrun, and Dadecheng Yingfeng Heng rushed to replenish their positions. The amount of spot goods that appeared was Heng Yu. At 10:30 AM, the price was 8.3 qian. After entering, receipts and disbursements were mixed, and the market was calm, with a slight rebound of a few qian. Around 11:00 AM, zero accounts were sold off, and the price was reduced to 7.5 qian. Later, Dadecheng came in with 105 bars and sold them to the Central Bank for spot goods, pulling the price up by 5 qian. At 11:30 AM, the price was 28 taels. Afterwards, selling pressure permeated the market, and Heng Yu, Heng Chang, Yong Yuan, Kang Xiang, Yuan Mao, Yongzhi, Feng Yong, Futai, and Heng all sold off, causing the price to fall again by 1.5 taels, to only 26.5 qian. It then rose to 6.8 qian. At the close of the noon session, the price was 26.6 qian, a decrease of approximately 3 taels compared to the previous day. After the close, there was a one-tael fluctuation from around 6 qian to 7 qian due to the settlement of scattered positions. The maximum fluctuation in half a day was 29.8 taels, and the minimum was 26.3 taels, a total fluctuation of 3.5 qian. The price for naked bars was raised by 11.5 taels. The posted price for U.S. dollars was raised to 0.25, to 797 taels, a spread of about 70 taels, similar to the previous day. The account for this month was 730 taels, next month 29 taels, December 27 taels, and supplementary water 29 taels.</p>
<p>Lack of Large Transactions: The over-the-counter transactions did not progress much. According to statistics, Qian Chang Xiang, Dadecheng, Yuan Tai, Yuan Xing Yong, Tongfeng Heng, Yingfeng Heng, Yongfeng, Yifeng, and Heng Yu all bought, while Fuxiang, Hefeng Yong, Daxing Yong, Heng Xing, and Wan Xing all sold. Yifeng Yong, Futai Heng, Hong Kang Yong, Ruixing, Shunli, and HSBC Chang all sold. Yuan Da Yong and Yuan Mao Yong roughly netted out. The Dalian group sold over 200 bars and bought over 100 bars, while the Guangdong group remained inactive. The total number of bars for all firms was approximately 22,300 to 22,400 bars.</p>

<p>| Domestic Market Initially Flat, Then Declined |</p>
<p>| Swap Prices Gradually Converging |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market saw British prices fall and U.S. prices remain stable, but the trend was solid. Foreign exchange rates did not see major changes. As for the local market, it was slightly higher in reality and flat on the surface. Lihua Bank increased the posted prices by half a notch, with British gold at 1.25 and U.S. dollars at 0.25. Other than Hong Kong, which did not change, all other rates were lower. Due to the sluggish trading among banks, the price difference was not too large. The market was initially flat, then stabilized, and finally declined in the afternoon. Compared to the day before, British gold was flat, and U.S. dollars rose sharply by 0.0625. However, the gold price was still over 3 taels lower, causing the swap prices to gradually converge, with the posted price set at a spread of 70 taels. As for the gold industry, there was some selling of U.S. dollars to swap into margin gold, with a total turnover of approximately 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. China-Belgium Bank traded British-American exchange rates, buying 30,075 yuan of January British gold and selling shillings at 19.3125 to 19.375, equivalent to 3.4525 U.S. dollars, the same as the previous day. Also, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 yuan of British gold was traded, mostly done between banks. Sassoon bought. There were few receipts and disbursements in the gold industry for the February contract. Due to the market being closed on Saturday afternoons, the market was closed.</p>
<p>The British exchange domestic market fluctuated by only 0.0625 in half a day. The selling price for the near-term contract opened at 1 shilling and 9 pence 1875, and the forward contract at 375.

The posted price was 1 yuan, equivalent to 3.3195 silver taels.</p>
<h3 id="e130">No Change in Big Bars and Exchange Rates <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>

<h3 id="e131">The Weekend Saw Heavy Fluctuations in Foreign Cents <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and banks were only open for half a day as usual, closing in the afternoon. Although the market traded throughout the day, the afternoon session was naturally quiet due to the banks being closed. However, at this time, the price of foreign cents was unstable, and without bank intervention, there were inevitably irregular price movements. Yesterday morning's fall in cents was due to sluggish buying demand, while the afternoon's rise was due to customers having uses for them but being unable to obtain them from banks.</p>
<p>Foreign Cents Fell in the Morning and Rose in the Afternoon, Resulting in the Same Price: The price of "foreign cents" fell by 1.75 cents in the morning session, to 7 qian and 0.055 cents. The price rebounded in the afternoon session, returning to the same level as the previous afternoon, at 7 qian and 0.0725 cents. The result was unchanged, but the situation still seemed promising. The "silver discount" market price for both the morning and afternoon sessions remained the same as the previous day, at 0.04, and the hedging water was very good, exceeding 1 qian, estimated at 1.23 qian, reaching 1.5 qian at one point.</p>
<p>Corner Coins Fluctuated, Copper Coins Were More Flexible: The price of Jiangnan small corner coins rose by 3 cents in the morning session due to people buying 10,000 to 20,000 corners, to 6 qian and 0.025 cents. The price fell back to the original price in the afternoon, remaining at 6 qian and 0.022 cents. The transaction volume was 13,000 corners in the morning session and 4,500 corners in the afternoon session. The price of Guangdong small corner coins also fell by 2 cents in the morning session, to 5 qian and 0.096 cents, and rebounded by 1 cent in the afternoon session, to 5 qian and 0.097 cents, resulting in a slight decrease of 1 cent. The transaction volume was 125,000 corners in the morning session and 35,000 corners in the afternoon session. The price of copper coins suddenly increased by 3,500 wen, to 422,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Transactions Were Still Active, Receipts and Disbursements Were Sparse: Due to the fact that yesterday was Saturday, there were relatively few receipts and disbursements of various types. Hua Shang received over 2.3 million in receipts and disbursements of draft funds, foreign firms received 1.6 to 1.7 million in receipts and disbursements of draft funds, 1.3 million in special funds, 7.8 to 7.9 million in various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds, 800,000+ in collateral transactions, 1.1 million in warehouse entries, 35 million+ in Qianzhuang Silver Public orders, 4.4 million+ in hedging funds, 700,000+ in remittances from various routes, and 1 million+ in cash settlements. "Yiyang funds" had 1.395 million in draft exchanges in the morning session and 1.07 million in the afternoon session. The paper currency transaction was 70,000 in the morning session and 45,000 in the afternoon session. The over-the-counter paper currency transaction was 115,000 in the morning session and 110,000 in the afternoon session. The check transaction was 80,000 in the morning session, with a market premium of 0.3125, and 65,000 in the afternoon session, with a market premium of 0.25. The interbank trading was 1.2 million in the morning session and 1 million in the afternoon session. Various banks' foreign accounts had over 1.6 million in receipts and disbursements, 2.3 to 2.4 million in paper currency recovered and issued, 7.5 million+ in Qianzhuang Yang Public orders, 2.5 million+ in foreign hedging funds, 1.7 million+ in foreign interbank loans, 900,000+ in foreign collateral transactions, 800,000+ in customer account withdrawals, and 700,000+ in small Qianzhuang transactions.</p>

<p>Bond Prices Continued to Rise by Several Corners</p>
<p>| Trading Volume of 2.5 Million Yuan |</p>
<p>Yesterday (15th), various spot bonds were offered on the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, but trading remained scarce, with only 12,000 yuan traded. Futures trading increased slightly, but sentiment remained subdued, with only sporadic trading on both sides. The morning session opened with over 1.1 million yuan, and the afternoon session with over 1.3 million yuan. Although the bond market environment did not change and major players still made few large transactions, the market demand was relatively strong, and swapping and replenishing were active. As a result, all prices continued to rise, but the increases were moderate. Except for disarmament spot, which rose by 8 corners, and the November futures, which rose by 1.2 yuan, other bonds rose by 2 to 3 corners.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market on Friday (14th) saw a strong surge as bulls began to buy in again.

<p>Yarn Market Rebounds Slightly</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market was slightly firmer due to a slight rebound after several days of continuous declines. Some profit-takers also took the opportunity to cover their positions. The market rebounded, but real demand from customers remained sluggish, so most sentiment still leaned towards selling. However, major bulls were still struggling.</p>
<p>Manbiao Rebounded Well: In the opening session of Manbiao futures, due to the rebound in U.S. cotton prices, there were fewer sellers in the market, and prices rose by 6, 8 qian for each month. In the afternoon, prices rose by another 2, 3, 4 qian for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 28,000 bales. The statistics show that Yichang sold 1,050 bales, Huachang 1,300 bales, Tongyu 1,000 bales, Dafeng 850 bales, and Jifeng 900 bales. Renfeng bought 1,050 bales, Changfeng 1,050 bales, Yuanfeng 1,000 bales, and Tianlong 1,100 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market turned firm due to the continued decline over many days, prompting profiteers to cover their short positions. As a result, a sudden rebound occurred, and American cotton also slightly rose. However, most people in this port are bearish, and factories are unwilling to purchase raw cotton due to sluggish yarn sales. Furthermore, a certain manufacturer's short position is particularly large, and Wing On Mill's purchases are stagnant. The future situation is uncertain.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Up Four Fen. The opening of the Zheng Biao forward market saw an increase of 1, 2, or 3 fen due to the slight rise in American cotton and a lack of sellers in the market. In the afternoon, prices for each month further increased by 0.5 to 2.3 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 69,500 dan. Sales included 4,000 dan of Jifeng, 2,600 dan of Tianlong, and 4,600 dan of Yuanda.

<p>Government Estimate Increases and Market Falls</p>
<p>New York, October 14th dispatch, the cotton market conditions for the week are as follows: The government cotton production report estimated an increase in production, and the speculative longs were initially unprepared for this, causing great disturbance. As a result, they sold off one after another, and soon the positions were closed out. However, before the holiday on Wednesday, due to purchases by peers, and because of unfavorable weather in the South, and reports of spot cotton sales in the interior, coupled with the fact that the number of hedges was less than the shorts covering, the price rose slightly. In other respects, buying interest was limited, followed by slightly more hedging. The wheat and securities markets were both weak, the climate was favorable for cotton production, and the theory that severe frost was plaguing the Northwest and North-Central regions of the cotton belt was gradually being dismissed. As a result, cotton prices weakened again. A major cotton grower believes that there has not been much frost in the pest-infested areas, and that it has not had much impact to reduce pests for next season. Domestic fabric industry statistics show that inventories in September decreased by about 23.5%, but the cotton market did not experience any impact as a result. Weekend statistics are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>

<p>Grain and Rice Market in Shanghai Turns Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market in South Shanghai saw about 20 establishments from Xilu source. Transactions on the main street were lively. At one point, Baitaoxin rice and other goods rose by 0.2 yuan. Du Yangjian rice sales were normal, with no change in price. Bai Ge rice was scarce and without market. The total volume for the day was about 2,000 shi.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were not many goods arriving in Xinzha from inland areas, about 23 or 24 ships. There was some activity on the way to the countryside. Xi Xin rice slightly entered the warehouse, rising by one or two chi. Yixing, Danyang, and Kunshan aged goods had weak interest and prices stabilized. Yang Du Jian did not perform outstandingly and the market presented a downward trend.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Re-export of Foreign Rice Uniquely Popular <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>| Imports of Foreign Rice Not Selling Well |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice showed no sign of recovery due to the sufficient stock. Saigon short-grain rice continued to weaken by a few cents. However, the number of unreported imports of foreign rice was small because most of them were urged by the customs to report in mid-August. Although there is a lot of stock at the moment, less than half of it is circulating in the market. Among this half, the re-exported goods that have not been reported are less than half. Recently, out-of-town merchants have been inquiring, and even merchants reported that the re-export list has been running low. Yesterday, casual merchants asked about it, and the owner raised prices higher than before, so they were not able to make a deal. However, the fact that re-exported foreign rice uniquely outperformed other rice markets is recognized by the industry. As for the foreign rice that has already been reported, only the main street is active. Yesterday, after it had weakened by two or three cents, it was bought. 800 bags of Saigon No. 1 Zhong Guan rice were sold at 9.023 yuan, and 300 bags of short-grain rice were sold at 7.65 yuan. Hunan rice is not selling well, but a batch is being shipped and will arrive at the market for sale soon.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Flour Market Closing Still Weak <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market fluctuated in both the upper and lower markets. Short-term prices initially stabilized and then continued to decline, while long-term prices initially remained stable and then rose before falling back to stability. Apart from a difference of about one fen in November and December, the other months only had a few li of fluctuations. Initially, the price of foreign wheat rose. Then, the factories made an agreement to deliver foreign wheat, and the buyers covered their short positions, causing the market to fluctuate. As a result, the short-term market remained weak because of the current low demand and continuous hedging by factories. The price fell by 0.25 fen for the current month, 0.1 fen for next month, 0.05 fen for December, and 0.25 fen for January. For the long-term market, factories did not issue many chips, and customers and short-sellers were buying and covering, so the market did not follow the downward trend of the short-term market. The closing price for February was unchanged, and the price for March rose by 0.025 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Wheat Market Mixed <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was firm in the morning and slightly fluctuated in the afternoon. Recently, the spot market has been weak, and market prices and sentiment are upward. However, after the long-term market weakened slightly, the market was slightly dragged down. The long-term market was strongly shorted by traders due to the arrival of foreign wheat. As a result, the price of the months of October and November was unchanged, December increased by 0.1 fen, and January to March each decreased by 0.02 fen. The current factory sale is still active, with 1,500 bags being issued and purchased by Huafeng Shenda. 3.37 to 3.35 liang was offered for Shaoxing wheat, 3.27 liang for Ying wheat, and 3.4 liang for Suqian wheat.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Chicago Wheat Turns Firm <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Friday (October 14th), Chicago wheat rose by 1.125 to 1.375 pounds due to the rebound in the New York stock market and purchases from the East. On October 13th, the total transaction volume was 20 million bushels. The market prices for October 14th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December 49.250 up 1.125</p>

<p>Shanghai Silk Mills Process and Reel Period Silk</p>
<p>After the labor unrest in the silk mills in the Hongkou district subsided, all the silk mills are now processing and reeling the period silk that was extended for delivery last month by the various foreign firms, in order to complete the deliveries. Because European and American markets have sufficient silk stocks and silk prices are sluggish, Shanghai factories have received telegrams indicating the market is weak. Yesterday, only Xinfu purchased 10 bales of FL brand top grade 13-15 denier Shanghai white factory silk, priced at 600 taels. Lienar purchased 6 bales of Iron Machine top grade 13-15 denier Sichuan yellow factory silk, priced at 575 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Lüzhuang Fine Eyebrow Tea Trade Slightly Active <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market saw Lüzhuang fine eyebrow green tea being purchased by Yingzhuang Yihuo Tongfu Jinlong and other firms, making the trade slightly more active. A large number of telegrams were sent out by Jin Chang, Bao Chang and other firms regarding Wuyuan Beilu wax-polished goods, and the market is gradually becoming more active. However, the selling price has fallen by 20-30 taels compared to the previous month, causing huge losses to Chinese merchants. There was no major trade in Gongxiu eyebrow and other grades.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: More Than 1,000 Bags of Wan Qing Offered</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was characterized by a general weakness as the exchange rate of Dutch currency was declining. The association's price indication tended towards stability with common grade 24-numbered sugar quoted at 14.875 taels but no deal was made. Higher grade was quoted at 14.975 taels. Fine sugar was at 15 taels. The average number of 18-numbered medium sugar was small, while the price of scarce 20-numbered medium sugar was quoted at 14 taels, but there were not much sales. The price of 890-numbered Dutch red sugar was about the same as the price of the previous market. The Jianbang Maochang offered 1,100 pieces of Wan Qing immediately upon arrival from Xiamen, and the price was 2.675 Dutch dollars. Dong Wu Qing's price was quoted at 3 Dutch dollars. The Da Lai Company offered 20 boxes of Gao Tong hand-made ice sugar, and the price was 10.01 taels per box, but the market was stable.</p>
<p>Northbound Goods, Jinshan Branch Soil Price and Number of Pieces All Rise</p>
<p>Jinshan branches have recently seen a sudden shift towards firmness in the market due to brisk sales. The most rapid increase has been in the price of the flat branch number of pieces. The northern market has released over a thousand cases in recent days, with high-quality goods rising to 28 taels and common goods to 24-25 taels. The price of Yuan branches has also risen, with high-quality goods at 24 taels, medium grade at 21-22 taels, and common grade around 20 taels. As a result, land prices have also been affected. The price of flat branches has increased by 40 yuan, with 28 taels being charged. The price of Yuan branches has increased to 35 yuan, with 25 taels being charged. Therefore, the trend seems to be tightening again. However, the goods from Zhangzhou have not been improved, and the sizes of the pieces vary, which does not suit customer taste. Therefore, the sales in various places are almost entirely occupied by Jinshan branches, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Metal and White Iron Sheet Prices are High and Transactions are Scarce</p>
<p>Yesterday, metal transactions were as flat as before. Northern merchants seemed to be less enthusiastic about purchasing. Factory users and shop business were still bustling, but mostly for small-volume sales. Therefore, the surface situation appeared to be busy. And each city moved, yesterday, more slightly, but recorded its main market conditions below for reference.</p>
<p>White Iron Sheets are Currently Being Sought After. After the price of white iron sheets increased, transactions progressed for a while. However, recently, users have felt that the price is too high and have been hesitant to adopt them. The out-of-town merchants are also cautious because the price of this product is expensive and it is difficult to sell at once. Therefore, in addition to inquiries, they do not dare to purchase, so the future of transactions is very quiet. However, the market price has been able to maintain and has not fallen. British 7-foot sheets are sold at 9.6 fen, 6-foot sheets at 8.2 fen, American 48 sheets at 15.5 taels, thick-patterned 28-gauge British sheets at 11.75 taels, American sheets at 16 taels, 26-gauge British sheets at 11.5 taels, American sheets at 15 taels, and 24-gauge British sheets at 11.5 taels, American sheets at 14 taels.</p>
<p>Round Nails are Still Selling Poorly. The sales of round nails have been very sluggish recently. Although the nominal price has not fluctuated much, the substance is very weak. The biggest reason is actually the impact of the brisk sales of locally made nails. It is reported that only about 200 buckets have been sold in recent weeks.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Chen Ronggong Views the Sichuan Situation <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Reasons are Complex and the Solution is Difficult</p>
<p>What is the Sin of the Sichuan People to Suffer This Calamity?</p>
<p>Since the conflict between Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui in Sichuan occurred, the inside story has been heard from afar, and opinions vary. The reporter of the New Voice News Agency, in order to make readers understand the situation in Sichuan, visited Chen Ronggong, a revolutionary elder from Sichuan and former commander of the Fourth Division, yesterday afternoon. Chen has the grace of being a teacher and friend to Deng Tian and others, and many of the middle-ranking officers in Sichuan were his students. Therefore, although he has retired to Shanghai and is absorbed in calligraphy and painting, he still receives news from Sichuan from time to time and is very knowledgeable. The following is a summary of what he said:</p>
<p>The History of the Two Lius. Liu Wenhui and Liu Xiang were originally uncle and nephew. Before the establishment of the Nanjing government, Liu Xiang was originally the commander of the Second Division of the Sichuan Army, while Liu Wenhui was only a brigade commander. The uncle and nephew have always established their own banners and followed different paths, but they still protected each other from time to time. Therefore, internally, they schemed against each other to expand their power, and externally, they adopted different tactics to shift attention and protect their positions. For example, Liu Wenhui's previous support for Yan Feng was later secured by Liu Xiang's power, and conversely, Liu Wenhui would also come out to protect Liu Xiang. Therefore, the general public in Sichuan regarded the interaction between the two Lius as a double act on stage, and they always called it "playing a double act." In fact, both Lius were taking advantage of the opportunity to increase their power. Therefore, every time a Sichuan war broke out, it was always at a time when the country was in turmoil, so that the central government and other parties would have no time to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The Real Cause of This Conflict. Judging from the past history of the two Lius, it seems that there would be no possibility of conflict when neither party had the strength to unify Sichuan. The reasons for this sudden move are more than one. On the one hand, Liu Wenhui recently purchased arms and ammunition from abroad, which were detained by Liu Xiang when they reached Sichuan. Liu Wenhui went to Chongqing and sat there for a day to demand them, but Liu Xiang repeatedly excused himself, claiming that it was done by his subordinates. As a result, although he promised to investigate and return them, he only made empty promises and never fulfilled them. Therefore, Liu Wenhui left in anger and prepared to use force to deal with it. When Liu Xiang heard about this, he was unwilling to show weakness. However, at that time, they were only showing off their strength to each other. Later, because various parties saw that there was a gap between them, they also provoked them, and it turned into a real split. Therefore, the conflict between the two Lius can be said to have been made real by pretending. On the other hand, Liu Xiang has shown considerable goodwill towards the central government in recent years, such as sending his division commander Wang Luquan's troops to western Hubei to suppress bandits. Therefore, he wants to take the opportunity to use the power of the central government to unify Sichuan.</p>
<p>Comparison of the Strength of the Two Sides. Judging from the strength of the two sides, Liu Xiang has five divisions plus a mixed brigade, with a total of about 130,000 people. The arms and ammunition are sufficient, but the weapons are slightly old. In addition, there are four small warships, which also have artillery positions, and are used for patrol. There are also thirteen aircraft, including two bombers, three reconnaissance aircraft, and the rest are civil aviation aircraft, which are also convenient for transporting essential items. The number of tank cars is also quite a few. Furthermore, Liu Xiang's subordinates have one characteristic, that is, Liu Mou's brigade is known as the "Divine Soldiers." Like the military advisors of each army, whenever there is a military operation, the decision is first made by the commander of this brigade. As to how effective it is, outsiders see it as truly mysterious, but Liu Xiang absolutely trusts it. Once, when Liu Xiang was conducting an exercise and dropping bombs, he asked this brigade commander about the outcome in advance. He was firmly told that it was unfavorable and advised Liu to change the date. Therefore, although Liu still went to supervise, he followed the advice of those around him and stayed away. As a result, on that day, the aircraft dropped bombs, and because the direction was inaccurate, more than 90 soldiers were killed and injured when the bombs exploded. If Liu had not avoided in advance, he would have been involved. Since then, Liu Xiang has relied on him more and more. Therefore, the people of Sichuan call him the "God of the Army, Navy, and Air Force." As for the discipline and training of Liu Xiang's troops, they are far inferior to Liu Wenhui's efforts. Liu Wenhui has two divisions plus a mixed brigade. The organization and training are the same as Yuan Shikai's Machang training system. However, the division commander does not have the power to command directly. Each division has two brigades, and one brigade must be its confidant command. The number of people is equal to Liu Xiang, and the equipment is the latest model, but there are no aircraft, warships, or tank cars. However, in terms of the strength of the armed forces themselves, Liu Wenhui's strength seems to be stronger than Liu Xiang's. Furthermore, in terms of economy, Liu Wenhui's defense area, because it is in the Chengdu area, is extremely abundant. Liu Xiang is far inferior to him. Recently, it has been learned that because of the failure of the previous shipment of equipment, Liu Wenhui has already opened up another route and is taking another route through Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guiyang.</p>
<p>The Attitude of Various Armies in Sichuan. Since the two Lius have started a conflict, the rest of the armies, depending on the distance, actually have the power to influence the overall situation. The leaders of these armies who are most noteworthy are Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, Luo Zezhou, and Li Qixiang. Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao, because they and Liu Wenhui graduated from the Baoding Military Academy, often join together because of the same academic system, forming a group with deep ties, a defensive alliance. Therefore, what has been reported in the newspapers recently that Deng and Tian are helping Liu Xiang to defeat Liu Wenhui has another inside story. Because Liu, Tian, and Deng's troops are all near Chengdu, things must be approved by all three before they can be implemented. If Deng and Tian help Liu Xiang to suppress Liu Wenhui, in the interests of these two themselves, they must not do this. Therefore, the reason why they have not abruptly changed their usual state is simply to send secret messages to the two Lius, engaging in provocation, hoping to create opportunities for themselves. Because Liu Wenhui's defense area is richer than anyone else's, the position towards Liu Xiang is more obvious. If this split turns into a real war, they will take the opportunity to occupy it. From a direct perspective, they will not be used by the two Lius. As for Liu Cunhou and Yang Sen, judging from their history and attitude, they seem to tend towards Liu Xiang, but it seems that the time is still too early. Luo Zezhou and Li Qixiang were originally the old troops of Deng Xihou, and they have not completely broken away from the relationship until now. Therefore, although they are now on Liu Xiang's side, they will certainly only follow Deng's lead in the future.</p>
<p>War Has No Good Outcome. From the above, it can be seen that the two sides are evenly matched, and their strength can be said to be evenly matched. Moreover, in terms of terrain, Liu Xiang's center of gravity is in Chongqing, located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and transportation must be more difficult. Liu Wenhui's troops are all in the upper reaches, with a commanding position. Therefore, Chengdu is suitable for attacking, and Chongqing has natural defensive works because it is surrounded by rivers on three sides, so it is suitable for defending. However, judging from the current situation, Liu Xiang is seeking a quick victory because of his more complete military equipment, and Liu Wenhui is still purchasing aircraft, etc. Although the contact and initiation seem to have been initiated by him, it is not actually the case. He is still waiting for a month before he can implement the attack, because Wang Lingji's troops who were suppressing bandits in western Hubei have recently been hastily concentrated in the Yichang area. It can be seen that Liu Xiang is preparing for war. However, the result will inevitably be like this, rising and falling, only suffering the Sichuan people.</p>
<p>It is Not Easy to Resolve the Sichuan Situation. It is currently heard that the central government is preparing to send senior officials to Sichuan to mediate. Judging from the above-mentioned complex reasons, it is feared that there will be no solution even if they go. The two Lius want to take advantage of the national difficulties such as suppressing bandits and the unrest in the Lu war to engage in expanding their own power, and there is a reason for what they do. It is by no means something that can be resolved with a few words. Therefore, to resolve the Sichuan situation, we must wait for the whole country to be peaceful, try our best to organize a strong Sichuan provincial government, return the political and economic power of the defense areas of each army to the provincial government, and then send troops to the border between Tibet and Kang, so that there can be a considerable solution. As for the people of Sichuan, because they have been exploited to the extreme for many years by the two Lius, such as various taxes, some of which have been in place for more than sixty years, it can be understood. Therefore, the Sichuan fellow villagers in Shanghai, in view of the fact that their hometown men have been in dire straits for 21 years, all hope that there will be a fundamental reform in the Sichuan situation.</p>
<p>On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway</p>
<h3 id="e148">Hu Hongji Dies <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Hu Hongji, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, along with his friend Zhang Zongkang and a certain Westerner, etc., in two private cars, left Shanghai for Hangzhou yesterday afternoon. They were driving along the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway and arrived at Haiyan Station at about 5 o'clock. Zhang Zongkang and another person were in the front car, driven by a Westerner, and they were driving very fast. Hu and Zhang Shoupei and two others followed behind, driven by Hu. Because it was getting late and they were anxious to get to Hangzhou, the car overtook Haiyan Station by three miles. At that time, the road was narrow, the road was rugged, and it was not easy to pass. Hu's car overturned to the left and jumped out of a stone embankment three zhang high, crashing into the beach. The area was very desolate. Fortunately, a stack material car from the Hangzhou-Pinghu road was passing by and heard cries for help, so they stopped and rescued them. Hu and Zhang were seriously injured, and the other two were slightly injured. They were accompanied to the Haiyan Hospital by the stationmaster of Haiyan Station. Hu died due to ineffective treatment, and Zhang's life is also in danger. Hu's body was parked in the car slot of Haiyan Station. However, Zhang Zongkang and others in the front car were unaware of what had happened behind them. After arriving in Hangzhou, they received a telegram from the stationmaster of Haiyan Station, and immediately went to rescue them with Dr. Sutler of Guangji Hospital. They returned to Hangzhou after two hours. Zhang Zongkang urgently reported the situation to Hu's house by long-distance telephone.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Huang Shaoxiong and Gan Naikang's Conversation <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Huang: Diplomatic Victory Still Requires Our Own Efforts</p>
<p>Gan: Internal Affairs Conference to Be Held on December 12th</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Minister of Internal Affairs and concurrently Minister of Communications Huang Shaoxiong and Vice Minister Gan Naikang arrived in Shanghai together yesterday morning from Nanjing to discuss departmental affairs. Yesterday, reporters visited them separately. Huang and Gan are scheduled to return to Nanjing tomorrow (Monday). The following is a record of their conversations:</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong spoke to reporters at the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. When asked about the situation in the central government regarding internal affairs and communications, he stated, "I am here to discuss departmental affairs. I arrived in Shanghai this morning. It is not necessarily just about internal affairs. Matters concerning the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the International Radio Station, and the Postal Service, all of which fall under the Ministry of Communications in Shanghai, are all being discussed." He also mentioned that Mr. Zhen Ru had requested to retire from his position as Minister of Communications, and the central government had asked him to take on the role concurrently. However, due to the heavy workload, he felt unable to handle both positions and had repeatedly requested the central government to appoint a replacement. As a result, he has not been relieved of the concurrent position and is still serving in both roles. He did not visit Mr. Wang (Jingwei) because the hospital was refusing visitors. As for whether he will go abroad and whether the Political Council will make changes due to personnel issues, he had not heard anything and was not clear on the details. In summary, both the internal affairs and communications departments are currently being reorganized. Li Zongren previously sent representatives Wen Qiaosheng and Yang Zhuang to Nanjing and Wuhan to meet with various parties to discuss border defense and the military situation in Guangxi. However, this happened a month ago, and the representatives have already returned to Guangxi. The central government has ordered American wheat, and there is a special department within the government to handle food matters. However, the total wheat production in China is only between 100 and 200 million tons, which is insufficient to be supplemented by foreign grain. This year, there has been a slight bumper harvest on both sides of the Yangtze River, so some people believe that the import of American wheat will affect domestic agricultural production and have risen up in opposition. In reality, if the purchased American wheat is averaged out and combined with domestic production, it is still not enough to meet the needs of the entire country. The American wheat will naturally be distributed to provinces with a shortage of food. Due to tariff and transportation issues, it cannot reach food-deficient areas in one step. Areas with good harvests, seeing this large batch of American wheat passing through, believe that its sale will suppress domestic agricultural production and therefore oppose it. I have no comments on the report. It is currently being studied and considered by the central government. However, I personally have one thing to say: the report can be studied, or it cannot be studied. Everything depends on our own efforts. If we can find ways to reorganize the existing military and political affairs, it will be enough to overcome the difficulties." After speaking, he shook hands and bid farewell. Lin Shi, Yang Jianping, and others also visited. Huang is scheduled to return to Nanjing tomorrow (the 17th).</p>
<p>Gan Naikang spoke about the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Yesterday, when reporters visited Gan Naikang at his residence in Shanghai, they asked about the recent situation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. According to Gan, the Ministry of Internal Affairs will convene a national internal affairs conference. At that time, civil affairs directors from various provinces, directors of public security, land, and health bureaus from various cities, as well as experts, will gather together. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has now dispatched personnel in three groups for inspection. The first group is the North China group, consisting of Gan himself, Section Chiefs Liang and Luo, and a technician. They will depart soon, first going to Zouping in Shandong, then to Tianjin and Dingxian, and then return to Nanjing via Kaifeng. The second group is the Jiangsu-Zhejiang group, consisting of three people including a department director, who will inspect along the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou railway and then to Nantong. The third group is the Hunan-Hubei-Henan-Anhui group, consisting of four people including Section Chief Zheng, who will be responsible for investigating the rehabilitation issues in the bandit areas. The inspection will be completed within one month. After returning to Nanjing, the Ministry of Internal Affairs will begin drafting proposals. Four proposals have already been drafted: (1) Implement a conscription system for the militia and security forces, similar to what is currently being done in Guangxi, to deal with national crises and strengthen national defense in the future. (2) Local self-government, including organizational and industrial development. (3) Rehabilitation of bandit areas, such as land consolidation. (4) Strict reorganization of local political systems. The conference secretariat has now been established. The conference organization will be passed by the Executive Yuan at its meeting next Tuesday. The conference is scheduled to be held on December 10th in the capital. This internal affairs conference will be different from the past. We will implement the resolutions with all our energy. I will return to Nanjing tomorrow (the 17th)." After speaking, he bade farewell.</p>

<p>Requesting Substantial Assistance</p>
<p>Cao Fengchun and Zhang Zhitian, two senators representing Geng Jizhou, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route of the Liaoning-Ningyi-Tong Volunteer Army, arrived yesterday with Commander Geng's official letter No. 147 to the Shanghai Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association, requesting assistance. The letter stated: "To whom it may concern: The Japanese invaders have aroused the anger of the entire country. Geng Jizhou, mindful of his country and home, raised the banner of righteousness and fought the brutal Japanese to the death. After years of bloody battles, he has received no supplies, which has prevented him from achieving complete success. With the severe cold of the border approaching, our valiant soldiers are still wearing single layers of clothing and cannot fill their stomachs. This situation should cause compassionate people to cry out in unison. I believe that all compatriots with a patriotic heart should have sympathy. Therefore, I have specially sent Yang Yijie, the director of the liaison office of our route, to the south to request assistance from all sectors. Previously, this person repeatedly represented our route in sending letters to your association to discuss the matter of supplies, which has already been reported and filed. I have now learned that your association requires a formal official document. Therefore, I have specially sent Cao Fengchun and Zhang Zhitian, two participants in our route, to the south to assist in handling everything. I hereby send this special letter, requesting that you consider the overall situation and provide our army with substantial assistance to kill the enemy, truly fulfilling the public's wishes."</p>

<h3 id="e151">Important Statements by Representatives Ma and Li <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Ma et al. are military and political leaders appointed by the state.</p>
<p>Their names were not listed in the public announcement of the People's National Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper reported that the public announcement of the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army listed the names of Generals Ma Zhanshan and Li Du at the end. Yesterday, the reporter from the Nisshin News Agency specially visited Ma Zhanshan's representative Tian Xiuqiao and Li Du's representative Liu Piguang at their residence to inquire about the truth. According to them, on the 14th of this month (the day before yesterday), the newspapers in this city published a public announcement from the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army led by Cheng Yun, Deng Jianzhong, and Shen Zhifu, requesting assistance, listing Mr. Ma and Mr. Li as committee members. Upon investigation, Chairman Ma and Commanders Li and Ding are all officially appointed military and political leaders of Jilin and Heilongjiang by the state, in charge of the military and political affairs of Jilin and Heilongjiang. They have never joined any organization, nor have they ever been listed in any public announcement or declaration. Moreover, Mr. Ma and Mr. Li have already issued a public announcement to the outside world and sent it to us (Tian and Liu) to be responsible for its publication. The fact that the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army listed their names in the telegram this time was neither telegraphed by Mr. Ma and Mr. Li, nor did we know anything about it beforehand. Mr. Ma and Mr. Li will not be responsible for any of their actions. I hope that all sectors will not misunderstand."</p>

<h3 id="e153">Yesterday <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Four Organizations Welcomed Mrs. Muir</p>
<p>and Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan and Chen Wulie</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation United Association, the Republic of China National Salvation Organizations United Association, the Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association, and the China Aviation Construction Association, held a reception at Tan Haiqiu's residence at No. 15 Jissi Fei'er Road to welcome Mrs. Muir, Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan, and Mr. Chen Wulie. Tan's residence is a Western-style building, but its exterior is completely in the ancient Chinese style, combining magnificence with solemnity. There are rockeries and fountains in front of the house, making it a quiet and elegant place, which is the most suitable place for receiving distinguished guests. After 3:00 PM, guests arrived one after another and were greeted by Dr. Yin Zhiling. The host entertained the guests with wireless radio music. At that time, the heavens were unkind and it suddenly rained heavily, which greatly disappointed everyone. Fortunately, the rain stopped and the sun came out, and the weather became more harmonious. Mrs. Muir arrived at 3:30 PM and shook hands with the welcomers one by one. She then went into the reception room to sit and chat for a while. Mrs. Muir is about 50 years old and wears simple and unpretentious clothes. The reception table was arranged in a T-shape, with flowers placed beside it. Over a hundred people attended, including Mrs. Muir, Weng Zhaoyuan, Chen Wulie, Yin Zhiling, Wen Zongyao, Xu Jigong, Yin Zhufu, Sun Bolan, Tan Bozhi, Tan Haiqiu, Tan Zhiyong, Chen Dingyuan, Huang Hongjun, Hu Zushun, Lin Jiyong, He Yongyuan, Zhang Pei, and others. Female guests accounted for one-fifth of the attendees. When Mrs. Muir took her seat, reporters from various newspapers competed to take pictures. Mrs. Muir stood among the female guests, as if trying to avoid being photographed by the reporters. After taking their seats, Li Cishan presided over the meeting, Ling Xianchang translated, and Xu Tongye recorded. The chairman reported the purpose of the welcome, mainly stating that Mrs. Muir, because the 19th Route Army stood on the side of justice and fought for the survival of the Chinese nation in the Battle of Shanghai, Mrs. Muir, representing the German women's community, traveled thousands of miles to China to express her sympathy. Not only is the 19th Route Army grateful for Mrs. Muir's kindness, but the people of the whole country are also grateful. Brigade Commander Weng is admired by countries all over the world and has now handed over his position as brigade commander. He will soon go to Europe and the United States to study. Brigade Commander Weng made contributions in the Battle of Shanghai, and there were no defensive structures in Wusong. The entire brigade had only a few thousand soldiers, and only eight hundred soldiers on the front line were able to hold out for more than thirty days. His reputation has spread far and wide throughout the world. In the future, Brigade Commander Weng's work can give us even more sympathy. Mr. Chen Wulie is an old friend of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and once used huge sums of money to support the revolution. He spared no effort in promoting Chinese culture in Siam. Our compatriots who live overseas owe much to Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen felt the greatness of the anti-Japanese work and donated a great deal to the Northeastern Volunteer Army. We hope that when Mr. Chen returns to Siam, he will be able to convey the good intentions of his compatriots in the motherland to the overseas Chinese." Mrs. Muir answered in English, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to have this opportunity to speak with you today. However, there is one thing I must correct to you: I do not represent the German people, but the people of all cultured countries in the world. People in Europe did not know anything about the situation in China until after the anti-Japanese war. Now, people all over Europe admire the bravery of the Chinese people and admire their ability to fight for justice and humanity. Anyone in the world can see that. Chinese people, Chinese consuls, and vice consuls all interact with us. Although most of the Chinese in Europe are laborers, they are very sincere, frugal, brave, and kind. Therefore, we value them. Since I came from Germany, I have passed through Italy, Spain, Luzon, Guangzhou, and other places. Especially in Luzon, I saw that the major banks were all in the hands of the Chinese, and there were many laborers who were honest and not deceitful. These people are the easiest to admire because they are all truly capable of saving China. Today, I cannot talk about Chinese culture because China has more than 4,000 years of culture. How was Germany 4,000 years ago? No one can imagine it. And China has more than 4,000 years of culture and 4,000 years of history. How can we allow the Japanese to lose the three northeastern provinces? As for General Weng Zhaoyuan, I have met him once. Although we did not talk much, I knew at a glance that General Weng was a calm and brave man. When he defended Wusong, we admired him very much. In the literature of all countries in the world, there are works about Weng. This time, General Weng's trip abroad to study aviation is also a necessary plan for China. Because the future war of the world will focus on air combat, China must first strengthen its aviation, and General Weng is the most suitable person to engage in aviation. Today, Mr. Chen Wulie, who is also welcomed here, I have not met, but when I was in Luzon, I heard his name. Major banks and merchants all expressed their respect for Mr. Chen. I deeply know that Chinese people pay great attention to justice. Because we are in Europe, far away from the ocean, we do not know who is right and who is wrong in this Sino-Japanese war, so it is difficult to speak out. Therefore, I hope that China will engage in foreign publicity to clarify the truth." Finally, Wang Qingxun played a harmonica piece for the soldiers of the 19th Route Army, followed by representatives Weng Zhaoyuan and Chen Wulie, who delivered replies before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Farewell Banquet for Luo Jingyou by the Security Corps <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the management committee of the city's security corps and the corps leaders and deputy leaders held a farewell banquet for the former chairman of the committee, Mr. Luo Jingyou, at Yizhixiang. During the banquet, Standing Committee Member Yao Mulian delivered a speech on behalf of all the security corps members, stating that since its inception a year ago, the corps' affairs have been managed by Chairman Luo with great effort. In this difficult time for the city, he has not only been able to fulfill his duties and protect local safety and tranquility, but also made significant developments in the organization and economy of the corps. Today, Chairman Luo is being promoted, and the corps members are overcome with the sadness of parting. On behalf of the wood corps members, I wish Chairman Luo a bright future." After the speech, Mr. Luo stood up and replied, "Comrades, Jingyou has worked with you for a long time, and now that I am about to say goodbye, I cannot help but feel a deep sense of reluctance. You comrades are all keenly aware of the meaning and mission of the security corps, the local connections, and the expectations of the public, and you have been working diligently to fulfill them. There is no need for me to say more. However, I would like to mention that the Shanghai Security Corps was reorganized from the early commercial corps and established during the Qi-Lu War. After being reorganized and developed by former Mayor Zhang, the regulations were clearly defined. Over the years, it has been able to show considerable achievements in assisting the military and police, maintaining local order, and protecting the people, which is obvious to everyone. Public opinion is satisfied, and there is a sense of trust. This is all due to the joint efforts and hard work of the past officials and comrades, who have fulfilled their responsibilities. It is not accidental. This year, with the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, the military and police worked hard to resist the invaders, and the situation was very serious. The mission of the Security Corps was also unusually tense. Maintaining local safety and tranquility and maintaining social order, all that should be done was done to the best of our ability, to supplement the shortcomings of the military and police, so as to complete the work of assisting and consolidating defense. Therefore, the corps in the war zone inevitably suffered heavy losses, and even those in the non-war zone were gradually stagnating due to the tight funding. Fortunately, Committee Member Yao Mulian, Committee Member Wang Binyan, and other committee members worked hard to support it, and Mayor Wu provided practical guidance and supervision to promote progress, so that it did not fall. Jingyou has repeatedly been entrusted by former Mayor Zhang and Mayor Wu to prepare for reorganization. I am ashamed of my meager abilities and have not been able to help. I am grateful to all comrades for not abandoning me and for pushing me to be a standing committee member during this difficult time. Jingyou declined but was forced to accept the difficult task. Since taking office, I have worked hard day and night, following Mayor Wu's instructions and discussing with all comrades to believe that the local merchants and people have suffered this catastrophe and have no time to rest. The only thing to do is to first reorganize the various teams in the non-war zone, and then resume the establishment of the teams in the war zone, and unify the corps, guide training, to lay the foundation and plan for progress. We have also formulated a revival plan based on the corps' losses, and submitted it to the municipal government for transfer to the Shanghai Post-War Committee to allocate funds to purchase equipment and military supplies, so as to supplement and strengthen our strength. The people's self-defense must cultivate the people's martial power, and Shanghai should not be regarded as a slow plan under the current situation. Today, the inspection of the district teams in the city has been completed, and the war zone losses and revival plans have been successively approved by the municipal government. Although the post-war financial reduction has not yet been fully realized, following this policy, gradual progress will surely live up to the expectations of Mayor Wu and all comrades. Jingyou is not talented, and I originally wanted to follow all comrades to complete the work. However, due to the urgent call to Wuhan, I had to leave in a hurry. There are things I want to say that cannot be fully expressed in writing. I am even more grateful to the leaders of the corps for bestowing me with a farewell banquet and presenting me with a silver tripod. How grateful I am! Now, I am fortunate that Mr. Zhang Tingjun is in charge of Jingyou's affairs, and his achievements should be a hundred times greater than in the past. It is foreseeable that although Jingyou is leaving, the corps' affairs will continue to progress. I only hope that all comrades will seize the opportunity to work hard and jointly achieve great things. Jingyou is looking forward to it. I would like to attach the meaning of the farewell speech of the ancients to express my foolishness. I hope you will understand."</p>

<p>Waiting for the dispatch of Commanders Tang and Li to kill the enemy</p>
<p>According to the Hualian News Agency in this city, the Liaodong Volunteer Army has recovered eighteen counties in Liaodong and organized the Liaoning Provincial Government. There are many Koreans in Liaodong, who also have a strict organization and have elected Li Huairan to lead the Sino-Korean Allied Army, which is a powerful force. The Japanese army is very worried. In order to eliminate the reaction, it decided to mobilize all its forces to clear Liaodong first. On the 9th of this month, it began to mobilize troops and surround it on all sides. The situation of the Tang and Li armies is extremely critical. Citizens of Shanghai Wei Deming, Huang Shiqin, Li Ming, Li Bo, Wei Bo, Lin Furan, Chen Yinghua, Fu Shan, Fu Yuguang, etc., seeing that the Tang and Li armies have no support outside the Great Wall, are very worried. They have invited more than 300 passionate warriors and unemployed people in the city, and have begun to implement military and political training. They will continue to go north to wait for the dispatch of Commanders Tang and Li to kill the enemy. Yesterday, they held a meeting at the office of Ruikangli, Dongjiaxing Road, North Sichuan Road, and elected representatives Wei Deming, Lin Furan, Fu Yuguang, Chen Yinghua, and Tang Zuofu to meet with Mr. He Yongzhen, the general representative of the army, to discuss the route of departure.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee, had previously intended to return home due to his father's illness to personally attend to him with medicine. Although he received a telegram from Qiupu yesterday stating that his father, Mr. Yutang, had seen the swelling subside and his condition improve, Mr. Xu remained extremely concerned. He telegraphed the Executive Yuan yesterday to request leave and is scheduled to take a ship back to Anhui tonight. Regarding the Shanghai Fundraising for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas Temporary Relief Association and its ongoing work, he will convene a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members this afternoon to discuss the implementation plan. The original telegram is transcribed below:</p>
<p>To Premier Song of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: Shiying previously requested and was granted 20 days of leave by your office to return home and care for my ailing father. Subsequently, his condition worsened, and I was ordered to handle the relief efforts for refugees in the Northeast. Before my leave expired, I returned to Nanjing and Shanghai on the 17th of last month to raise relief funds and discuss disaster relief in the recovered counties of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces. Recently, I received a telegram stating that my father's illness had recurred, with swelling in his legs and abdomen and reduced appetite. Given his advanced age and prolonged illness, the situation is critical. I am extremely worried and intend to return home immediately to attend to him. I humbly request that Your Excellency grant me 20 days of leave so that I can attend to him with peace of mind. I await your order with utmost gratitude. Yours respectfully, Xu Shiying, cold seal.</p>
<p>Convening a Meeting: Mr. Xu sent a letter to the executive and supervisory committee members of the Shanghai Fundraising for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas Temporary Relief Association yesterday, stating: "Greetings, as the association has just been established, there is an urgent need for active organization and implementation to comfort the hopes of millions of disaster victims in the recovered areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is only with the collective wisdom and efforts of all of you that we can overcome the difficulties and save those in dire straits. I recently received a telegram stating that my father in my ancestral home of Qiupu is critically ill. Upon reading it, I was deeply alarmed. As a wandering son far from his parents' home, I plan to take a ship on the evening of the 16th to return home and care for him with medicine, hoping to fulfill my filial duty. Therefore, a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory standing committee members of this association will be held at 4:00 PM this afternoon. I respectfully request that you arrive on time to discuss and determine the implementation plan and jointly devise strategies. I eagerly await your arrival."</p>

<h3 id="e162">Construction <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Actively Proceeding in the Central Area of the City</p>
<p>Establishment of a Construction Fund Management Committee</p>
<p>The construction project in the central area of the city was halted due to the January 28th Incident. After the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works immediately resumed work according to the original plan. The construction of the new municipal government building resumed on July 1st, and the road earthwork project within the first batch of land requisition resumed on September 1st. The Municipal Government, in accordance with the principle of transparency in finances and to promote the construction of the area, established the Central Area Construction Fund Management Committee, appointing Cai Zengji, Director of the Finance Bureau, and Shen Yi, Chairman of the Central Area Construction Committee, and inviting Mr. Lin Kanghou, as well as electing Dong Chengdao and Xia Pingfang as representatives of the landowners, to serve as members of the committee, responsible for managing the construction funds of the area, demonstrating the determination to build a new urban area. The committee has also resolved to expedite the collection of land prices to meet the payment of construction costs. The project plans and progress of the area, as obtained from various sources, are detailed below: Project Plans: The construction project within the first batch of land requisition in the central area of the city is divided into roads, ditches, bridges, landscaping, and buildings, and will be carried out in three phases. The first phase involves filling the entire subgrade and 40% of the six-meter-wide asphalt road surface, 50% of the ditches, and building bridges and planting trees. The entire subgrade is expected to be completed by the end of November this year, and the road surface and ditches will be completed by September next year.</p>
<p>Progress: Since the resumption of work, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has been actively supervising the progress of the project. The completed projects include the buildings of the Central Area Construction Management Office. The projects currently underway include the new municipal government building, the police station building of the Public Security Bureau, and the subgrade and roadbed projects. Other projects such as bridge construction and ditching are also being planned, and several thousand saplings have been ordered from the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing for the layout of parks, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. However, most of the ongoing projects are currently focused on the subgrade, so they are not easily noticeable. Once the road surface, bridge, and ditch projects are implemented, there will be a new look.</p>
<p>Pickled Meat Industry Opposes the Collection of Pickled Pork Inspection Fees</p>
<h3 id="e163">Answers from Directors Cai and Hu <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Finance Bureau Director Cai Zengji and Health Bureau Director Hu Hongji sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Greetings, we have received your letter No. 149, which states that on September 30th, the Municipal Pickled Meat Industry Association stated in a letter that the Finance and Health Bureaus have recently suddenly levied pickled pork inspection fees, disregarding the difficulties of merchants. All pickled meat merchants in the city are greatly angered and unanimously oppose it, believing that at a time when internal and external troubles are pressing and the social economy is precarious, all industries are declining, and doing business is already difficult. Now, the authorities want to use inspection as a pretext to extort money, adding unnecessary burdens. The pickled meat merchants know that they are unable to bear the burden and will be forced to close down. The authorities will only alienate the people and create disputes, which is not a blessing for society or the country. Therefore, our association previously sent a letter to your chamber, asking you to understand the difficulties of merchants and urge the municipal authorities to realize their error and withdraw the proposal to collect pickled pork inspection fees. Now, the municipal authorities insist on their decision, disregarding the difficulties of merchants, not only refusing to cancel the fees but also actively collecting them, destroying business operations and disrupting the market. Those who should protect the people are harming them, and those who should benefit the country are harming it. All pickled meat merchants in the city have gathered at our association and unanimously resolved to oppose it. If the authorities disregard public opinion and act arbitrarily, they will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. We have always admired your chamber as a guarantor of the business community and believe that you will understand the difficulties of merchants and provide protection. Therefore, we reiterate the reasons in detail as follows: (1) Shandong is the main source of pickled pork, and the slaughter tax and inspection are strict there. As raw fresh pork, it has already undergone strict inspection, and inferior goods have long been eliminated. Only the best quality pork is salted and pickled to produce pickled pork for export. Therefore, in fact, pickled pork is generally of good quality and has already been inspected, so there is no need for further inspection. Moreover, the fees are exorbitant, and merchants cannot afford to bear them, so they will inevitably continue to raise prices. Foreign goods, such as salmon, are taxed very simply and cheaply. Therefore, this repeated inspection is tantamount to a disguised method of blocking domestic products and encouraging foreign goods. The hygiene is not actually improved, and the fees are collected under false pretenses. This is the first reason for opposing the inspection. (2) People only worry about the safety of fresh meat, but pickled meat has never been a source of danger. In Shanghai, pickled pork has been sold for hundreds of years, and many people eat it, but no one has ever been harmed by eating pickled pork. Pickled pork is pickled in salt in a vat and cannot produce microorganisms, so it is definitely safe and there is no doubt about it. Now, the authorities are concerned about the health of the people, but there are many things in society that harm public health, and they do not actively clean them up. Instead, they want to impose repeated inspections and fees on pickled pork, which is safe in both fact and custom, to burden our people and our merchants. How can this be? Furthermore, people who have a reduced appetite after illness often use pickled meat to stimulate their appetite because it tastes good and can increase their appetite. It is similar in effect and taste to Western butter and dried game, which further proves that pickled pork is a safe food and does not harm health. This is the second reason for opposing the inspection. (3) Pickled pork in Shanghai comes from other ports, and the pickled meat merchants in this city only sell on behalf of the guest merchants, earning a small commission. The guest merchants incur large costs in transporting pickled pork, and in recent years, the price of rice, firewood, and other goods has been high, so their expenses are large and their profits are small. Moreover, they travel across the ocean to Shanghai, where they are often threatened by pirates. The risks are many. It is already seen as a difficult journey. At a time when the situation is unstable, business operations are even more difficult. Therefore, the supply of pickled pork to this city has already decreased, and businesses are declining. If the authorities want to create inspection fees, it will be even more difficult to do business. The guest merchants have already stopped shipping goods upon hearing about the proposal to collect inspection fees. If the inspection fees are implemented, pickled pork will inevitably disappear from Shanghai. The authorities are no different from cutting off the people's food supply. Anyone with a heart would not do this. This is the third reason for opposing the inspection. (4) Since the September 18th Incident, business has declined sharply, especially for pickled meat merchants. This is because pickled meat is not a daily necessity, and the people's economic difficulties have affected it. The wounds of the January 28th Incident have further deepened the suffering of the people in Shanghai, leading to more business failures. All debts in the war zone have not been recovered, and it is difficult to recover debts even outside the war zone. The merchants are barely maintaining their businesses for the sake of the livelihoods of thousands of employees. If new taxes are levied and inspection fees are added, the merchants will not be able to bear the burden and will have to close down and seek other livelihoods. This is the fourth reason for opposing the inspection. The above reasons are all based on facts. All pickled meat merchants in the city are determined to oppose it to the end. The situation is urgent. We ask your chamber to understand the difficulties of merchants and quickly request the municipal authorities to immediately cancel the decision to collect inspection fees in order to maintain business operations and alleviate the difficulties of merchants." According to this, the two industries of pickled meat and ham have repeatedly expressed opposition since your bureau proposed the plan. Because they did not list the reasons, they were not conveyed. Now, according to what they have stated, they believe that pickled pork is transported from other ports after being pickled, and is wrapped in salt. Although it looks rough, it is definitely not rotten. It has been sold in Shanghai for a long time, and those who eat it have not had any adverse impressions. Therefore, there is no need for inspection. After the January 28th Incident, the city's business has been in a slump, and the pickled pork industry is no exception. At a time when both supply and sales are weak, it will be even more difficult to maintain business operations if inspection fees are added. Therefore, there should be no inspection. Considering the situation, there are some reasonable grounds. It is appropriate to inform your bureau of the situation and request that you consider it and submit it so that the implementation can be temporarily delayed to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. I am deeply grateful. In addition to sending separate letters, etc., it is hereby approved. After investigation, the main purpose of the Pickled Meat Industry Association in requesting the cessation of inspection of meat products entering the city is not that meat products entering the city should not be inspected, but to hope that the collection of pickled pork inspection fees can be reduced. It can be seen that the association does not know that the city's inspection of meat products entering the city is to improve public health and is an inherent function of health administration. However, there are many misunderstandings about the meaning of this case, so a detailed explanation should be given to clarify the truth and dispel doubts. The answers are as follows: 1. The original letter states that the Finance and Health Bureaus have recently suddenly levied pickled pork inspection fees, disregarding the difficulties of merchants. All pickled meat merchants in the city are greatly angered and unanimously oppose it, etc. The inspection of meat products entering the city is based on the city's Inspection of Meat Products Entering the City Regulations, which were approved and promulgated by the Municipal Government on October 18, 1930, and the Finance Bureau sent personnel to deliver the regulations to the pickled meat and ham associations for compliance in November of that year. The associations have sent letters to the Finance Bureau, all with the sole purpose of requesting exemption from inspection fees. This case has been going on for two years and is not a recent occurrence. It is also not true that the difficulties of merchants are disregarded. According to Article 4 of the Inspection of Meat Products Entering the City Regulations, the original inspection fee was one yuan per 100 catties, but in June of this year, the Municipal Government issued Instruction No. 1482, reducing it to only half a yuan per 100 catties, which is sufficient proof that the Municipal Government has indeed considered the difficulties of merchants. Moreover, in practice, the inspection fee per catty is only five li, and the burden of the pickled meat and ham merchants will ultimately be passed on to the consumers. Now, the consumers are paying the inspection fee for the sake of health, so why should the pickled meat and ham merchants be so angry? Moreover, the inspection of meat products entering the city is mainly aimed at eliminating inferior products and protecting public health, which is the duty of the municipal authorities. There is no reason to obstruct the process. Furthermore, every year, not only pickled meat and ham are inspected, but also fresh meat, frozen meat, lard, sausage, liver, etc., as well as all products from pigs, cattle, and sheep that can be used for food. How can the pickled meat association guarantee that there are no plague-infected meat products mixed in? Even just considering pickled meat, how can the association guarantee that plague-infected meat is not made into pickled meat elsewhere? If it is said that the pickled meat merchants will not approve the import of inferior goods, then how can it be guaranteed that the inferior goods will not be sold to the citizens? Based on the above, if public health is the premise, there is no reason to oppose the inspection of meat products entering the city. Pickled meat is a major category of meat products entering the city, and inspection is especially necessary to eliminate inferior goods and protect public health. Because the sales area is wide, it is easy for inferior goods to be mixed in, which can harm the health of consumers, and the crisis is the greatest. 2. The original letter states that the municipal authorities disregard public opinion and act arbitrarily, and they will not hesitate to make any sacrifices, etc. Municipal facilities are based on the principle of protecting the greatest happiness of the greatest number of citizens. The inspection of meat products entering the city is aimed at protecting the health of those who eat meat products entering the city. In this city, excluding vegetarians and those with religious reasons or poor children, there are at least 2 million people who eat meat products entering the city. Should the meat products that harm health not be removed for them? If there is no inspection, the safety of more than 2 million people who eat meat products entering the city will be sacrificed. Implementing inspection, then the pickled meat merchants will also be protected, and there is no sacrifice to be made. It is considered arbitrary to not understand the truth, disregard the public interest, and insist on one's own way, or to oppose it for no reason. Whether the city should inspect meat products entering the city in terms of reason and public interest is the key point that should be recognized. If you do not deny the principle that the city should seek the happiness of the greatest number of citizens, then why should you oppose the promotion of public health protection with the private views of a small group? And why should you use the threat of making any sacrifices to oppose the promotion of public health protection? This is not what an enlightened citizen and a legitimate organization should do. It is hoped that the association will reflect on this. 3. The original letter states that Shandong is the main source of pickled pork, and the slaughter tax and inspection are strict there. In fact, pickled pork is of good quality and has already been inspected, so there is no need for further inspection, etc. Before the competent health administrative agencies in each place of origin have formally notified this city, it cannot be said that this city does not need to inspect again, because there is no record to support it. The effectiveness of this city's laws and regulations should not be shaken. This is the normal course of the rule of law, and all administrative agencies and various organizations should follow it together. 4. The original letter states that foreign goods are taxed very simply and cheaply, so this repeated inspection is tantamount to a disguised method of blocking domestic products and encouraging foreign goods, etc. The simple and cheap taxation of foreign goods is due to the bias of unequal treaties, which is a great regret that all Chinese people feel deeply. However, the nature of donations and taxes is different from that of handling fees. The inspection fee is a type of handling fee and cannot be discussed in the same breath. Now, considering it from the perspective of commercial trade, the ham association should not forget the painful history of ham exports being squeezed out. In the past, other countries squeezed out the import of Chinese ham, and the only argument was that it had not been inspected by a qualified veterinarian and might harm health. If Chinese food strives to meet hygiene standards everywhere, it is also a way to strive for self-improvement. If foreign goods are protected by unequal treaties and the taxes are low, it should not be said that the hygiene of domestic goods that are prone to harm need not be inspected, and handling fees must be exempted. It is like choking on food and giving up eating. How can we compete in today's world where the fittest survive? The reason why inspection fees must be collected to cover office expenses is that public finances are insufficient, so we rely on the support of more than 2 million people who eat meat products entering the city to make things happen. The association is stuck in appearances and has this misunderstanding of putting the cart before the horse. Letting go of all food that is prone to harm is definitely not a good way to encourage domestic products and block foreign goods. Moreover, if domestic food is not subject to hygiene regulations, foreign merchants can use it as an excuse and promote how hygienic their foreign goods are in order to achieve their economic aggression strategy. The association can observe the food sold into our country and see if there is anyone who does not promote how hygienic their food is. It is hoped that the association will reflect on this. 5. The original letter states that pickled pork is pickled in salt in a salt vat and cannot produce microorganisms, so it is definitely safe, etc. If plague-infected meat is pickled in salt, even if the bacteria have been killed, the toxins excreted by the bacteria may not be completely eliminated, and those who eat it may still suffer from food poisoning. Therefore, it cannot be said that all pickled meat is hygienically safe, and the pickling method cannot be used as a guarantee that plague-infected meat is safe. 6. The original letter states that there are many things in society that harm public health, but they are not actively cleaned up. Instead, they want to impose repeated inspections and fees on pickled pork, which is safe in both fact and custom, etc. The pickling method is not a guarantee that plague-infected meat will not be mixed in, and it is not a guarantee that plague-infected meat can be considered safe once it is pickled. This has been explained in detail in the previous article, so it goes without saying that the previous misunderstandings and misinterpretations in fact and custom are not sufficient to be used as a reason to oppose inspection. As for saying that there are many things that harm public health, the association can list them in detail and report them for investigation and rectification. You cannot say that there are other things that harm public health, so there is no need to inspect meat products entering the city either. If everyone shirks responsibility, nothing will be accomplished. This is not a reason to demand the cessation of inspection of meat products entering the city. According to the letter, it is appropriate to reply, hoping that you will investigate, inform the association, and no longer adhere to prejudices and work together to promote public health in this city. I hope for this."</p>

<h3 id="e164">Attention from All Sides <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>League of Nations Report</p>
<p>Phenomenon That Should Exist Amidst the Severe National Crisis</p>
<p>Shen Society's Report to Be Published Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shen Society, an organization composed of prominent figures in the journalism field and professors from various universities, specializing in the study of international and diplomatic issues, has, in light of the publication of the League of Nations Investigation Commission's report, and the limited number of Chinese and English copies printed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while the demand from all sides is very high, made a special effort to rush-print a Chinese version first, and compile world opinion of more than 10,000 words, attached to the report for reference. The society's declaration and pre-order and wholesale methods are published below:</p>
<p>Shen Society Declaration: The League of Nations Investigation Commission's report is what the League of Nations will use to resolve the issue of the Three Northeastern Provinces.</p>
<p>If the League of Nations resolves it well, the Sino-Japanese dispute can be resolved, and there is a glimmer of hope for world peace. If it is not resolved well, not only will the Sino-Japanese dispute intensify, but it may also lead to a second world war. Therefore, the League of Nations Investigation Commission's report is of great and immense importance. The survival of the Three Northeastern Provinces is closely related to the fate of our nation's people, so is this investigation report not worthy of everyone's attention? Moreover, those who study this report must observe the attitudes of the Chinese and Japanese governments and people, and the opinions of various countries in the world, before they can predict what kind of effect this report will have in the future. Therefore, an appendix of opinions from all sides is added. In short, whether the national crisis can be resolved depends entirely on the outcome of this report. The people of the country should not ignore it.</p>
<p>Pre-Orders Crowd the Place: The society has printed this important book in three days with great determination and unlimited sacrifice, which is no easy task. The first edition is only 5,000 copies, and it is feared that those who buy it after publication will be eager to buy it, and those who arrive later will inevitably regret it. Therefore, from yesterday (15th), it entrusted the Shen Bao newspaper office on Sanma Road and the Xinwen Bao newspaper to start selling pre-orders, charging only four corners of the ocean for each copy. After this news was released, the doors of the two newspaper offices were crowded from morning to night yesterday, with people rushing to buy the pre-order vouchers. It is estimated that 1,954 vouchers were sold in one day, and most of the buyers were young people. From this, it can be seen that the people of the country already know the seriousness of the issue of the Three Northeastern Provinces, and the League of Nations report is really too related to our country. The two newspaper offices will continue to sell today and will stop at 12:30 noon tomorrow. At 4:00 pm, the books can be picked up at the original sales location.</p>
<p>Purchases from Other Ports: The society is also aware that there must be countless readers in other ports who are eagerly waiting to read the contents of the report as soon as possible. The society decided that after the book is published tomorrow afternoon, it must take out 1,000 copies and immediately send them to Nanjing, Hangzhou, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, entrusting major bookstores to sell them. Other ports are welcome to wholesale. The society has rushed to print the second batch, which will be published in three to five days. All wholesale orders must be paid in cash, at least 100 copies, calculated at a 30% discount, plus one yuan for postage to show preferential treatment. Those who wish to wholesale can send a letter to the distribution department of the Shen Society at Guohua Advertising Company, No. 280 Shandong Road, Shanghai. Retail readers can purchase from the Shanghai Shen Society (address as above), calculated at 95% of the postage.</p>
<p>Chinese and English Versions: The Chinese version translated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is already faithful and accurate, but there is an even greater need for Chinese and English bilingual editions to be compared with each other. Therefore, a Chinese and English bilingual edition is also being printed at the same time and is being proofread. It will also be published in the shortest possible time and will be announced later.</p>
<h3 id="e165">The Yarn and Cloth Exchange Case <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Second Instance Was Heard Yesterday</p>
<p>Both Sides Made Detailed Statements</p>
<p>Clients of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, such as Sha Weiyi, sued the exchange in the First Special District Court for illegally resolving all clients' futures trading on February 9, resulting in huge losses. Judge Yang Peng ruled that the resolution of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange on February 9 was invalid. The exchange did not accept the original judgment and appealed. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 pm, the president of the High Court, Hu Yigu, personally heard the case. Gao Shoutian of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, along with lawyers Liu Chongyou, Zhang Shizhao, Wang Fushang, Chen Zhongyin, etc., arrived in court around 1:00 pm. The defendants Sha Weiyi, Fu Zidong, Wang Junbai, Ming Jingheng, Chen Rongcai, Wang Shengchu, etc., and lawyers Shi Ying, Tao Jiachun, Yao Xichen, Zhang Zhengxue, and more than ten people who participated in the lawsuit, such as Wang Guanxian, arrived in court one after another to await the hearing. President Hu took a seat in the Second Civil Court. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the first instance was lost. On the appellant's side, it was believed that the original judgment's reasoning was insufficient, and the original judge did not fully understand the Exchange Law. Therefore, they appealed, and explained the reasons for the suspension of trading due to the war. Then, the defendant's lawyers Shi Ying, Tao Jiachun, Zhang Zhengxue, etc., denied the resolution of the previous meeting of the Exchange Council because the number of attendees did not meet the quorum, and proved that there was still trading of spot yarn at the time, but the exchange forcibly closed other people's trading. It is difficult to recognize in reason and law. Both sides made detailed statements and corrections. Until 5:30 pm, it was too late, so it was announced that the date would be changed to start the debate.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Assassination of Wu Guangzong Case <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The First Special Court Rules That Judgment Should Be Based on Existing Charges</p>
<p>The case should then be transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Henan natives Song Jiande, Wu Guigui, Zhang Shaoliang, and Huzhou native Yao Jiechen, committed robbery at the Changxing Coal Mine Bureau in Zhejiang Province last November, fatally shooting the bureau's police chief, surnamed Lu, and stealing over 5,000 silver dollars and over ten firearms. Recently, Li Nianyuan, the detective chief of the Second Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Team, along with detective Yao Bailin, and collaborating with Liu Junqing, a Chinese detective from the Old Zha station of the Public Concession, and Bao Tangyu, a detective, apprehended them at hotels such as the Juelu Hotel. Four pistols bearing the seal of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau were confiscated. They were brought to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Subsequently, Song and others confessed that the assassination of Wu Guangzong, the director of the Hydrographic Office of the Ministry of Navy, and the robbery at No. 1040 Wuzhou Road were committed by them and Zhou Mingshan. Zhou Mingshan (also known as Zhou Asi) is now serving as a detective in the Second Regiment of the Zhejiang Security Team. The police arrested Zhou, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Feng De, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the First Special Court, continued the interrogation in criminal court No. 1. First, Ru Baoyi, the police lawyer, stated that the police were only charging the defendants with robbery and violating Article 1 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Military Firearms. Regarding the assassination of Wu Guangzong, although the police suspected the defendants, they did not bring charges and would leave it to the competent authorities to handle. However, the Public Security Bureau has now detained Zhang Changlin, who is also a principal offender in the Wuzhou Road robbery case, and the cases should be tried together. He requested the court to send a document to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to bring Zhang for joint interrogation and requested another extension of the hearing. Zhan Jifeng, a legal counsel, also represented the Municipal Public Security Bureau in court and requested that the defendants be handed over. Lawyer Zhan stated that criminal cases should be prosecuted based on the severity of the crime, and the most serious crime should be prosecuted first. The case of the defendants plotting to kill Wu Guangzong is the most serious, and the law allows for the death penalty. The robbery case brought by the police can only be punished with imprisonment. Therefore, the murder case is more serious than the robbery case. Thus, the case should be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and prosecution first. Moreover, Wu Guangzong was an incumbent official, and the defendants dared to assassinate him, which is obviously a major event. If the investigation is delayed, it would greatly impede the investigation, which should be noted by the court. Lawyer Ru immediately stated that the police are willing to assist the Public Security Bureau, but since the police have already brought charges in this case, a judgment should be made first on the existing charges before the Public Security Bureau takes over the case, in accordance with legal procedure. The representative of the Zhejiang Security Team also requested that the defendants be transferred to Zhejiang. Judge Feng declared that since the police had already brought charges in this case, a judgment should be made first on the existing charges before they could be transferred. Furthermore, the assassination of Wu Guangzong occurred in Shanghai, and for the convenience of investigation, the case should be transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation. In the future, when the bureau sends the case to the local court, it must notify the Security Team whether the case can be transferred to the local court of Zhejiang Province for adjudication. Thus, the case was adjourned for another hearing, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e167">After the Murderer Chen Tugeng Escaped <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Severely Punish the Guards</p>
<p>One Fat, One Thin, Each With a Photograph</p>
<p>Such Negligence is Truly Blameworthy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court Detention Center had murderer Chen Tugeng and gambling offender Chen Tugeng enter the detention center successively. As the sentence of the gambling offender Chen Tugeng had been completed, he was released under substituted execution. The murderer Chen Tugeng was then substituted, and escaped. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that after reading the report, the President of the Local Court, Chief Prosecutor, and others immediately went to the detention center to investigate and found it to be true. They immediately handed over Bao Fuchen, the clerk in charge of receiving and dispatching, and Li Yamin, the head of the guard, to the prosecutor for investigation. When the detention center receives and dispatches prisoners, it should first inspect the defendant's photograph. The head of the guard should hand it over to the clerk for further verification, and inquire about the age, origin, and cause of the case, and compare it with the case file before releasing or receiving them. Chen Tugeng both have photographs, and the murderer Chen Tugeng is fat, while the gambling offender Chen Tugeng is thin. This kind of negligence is truly blameworthy, and the escape has been for many days. Therefore, those with specific responsibilities in the detention center are all responsible. Therefore, Bao and Li were ordered to provide reliable guarantors and were given a deadline to recapture the prisoner, otherwise, they would be punished together.</p>
<p>Alas</p>
<h3 id="e168">Two Young Men Drown Themselves <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Names and Ages Cannot Be Investigated</p>
<p>The Reasons for Suicide Are Difficult to Ascertain</p>
<p>Over the past two days, two young men have successively committed suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River from sampans. Both were not rescued and died in the river. Their names, ages, and reasons for suicide are unknown. The circumstances are described below:</p>
<p>A Loud Cry At 10:40 p.m. the night before last, a young man in a Western suit came to the wharf of the New Customs House on the Bund of Hankou Road. He looked around on the wharf and hesitated for a moment. He then hired sampan No. 68, saying that he wanted to cross to Pudong. The sampan operator, Pa Gencai, thought he was an ordinary passenger, so he did not pay attention and immediately moved the sampan away from the shore, gradually heading towards Pudong. The moon was bright, and the river was like a mirror. When the sampan reached the center of the river, the young man suddenly stood up from the cabin, shouted loudly, and jumped into the river to commit suicide. When the sampan operator, Xin Gencai, saw this, he was shocked and tried his best to rescue him with a bamboo rake. However, the angry waves were merciless, and the man was gone. Xin had no choice but to bring the empty boat to the Customs Water Police Station to report the situation and leave. The body of the deceased has not been found as of last night.</p>
<p>Emerging Twice Yesterday at 8:00 a.m., a young man wearing a light-colored long robe and speaking with a Ningbo accent also went to the New Customs House wharf and hired sampan No. 1395 to cross to the Jiangmatou in Pudong. When the sampan reached the center of the river, the man also jumped into the river to commit suicide. At this time, the sampan operator, Dai Genyou, was panicked and saw the jumper emerging twice, but did not attempt to rescue him. Instead, he turned around and tried to escape. Wang Haiquan, a detective from the Customs Water Police Station, was also sitting on the sampan in front of them. Upon learning that someone had jumped into the river, he quickly ordered the operator of his own sampan to turn back and try to rescue him. However, they were too far away from each other, and by the time they arrived at the scene, the person had already sunk and disappeared. Detective Wang believed that the sampan operator, Dai Genyou, had missed the opportunity to rescue the deceased, which was tantamount to causing death by negligence, and that he had fled in hopes of escaping punishment, which was extremely hateful. He immediately detained Dai and the boat at the police station. After questioning by the police chief, the sampan was detained at the police station, and Dai was handed over to the original detective to be sent to the Local Court for questioning.</p>
<p>Robbery Case on North Henan Road</p>
<h3 id="e169">Twelve More Robbers Apprehended <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw Driver Had Bad Intentions</p>
<p>Owner Behaved Extravagantly</p>
<p>The home of Wang Shaofu, a Ningbo native, at No. 123 Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road, was invaded by several robbers at around 8:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. They brandished guns to silence any outcry, and three robbers went upstairs to start searching. One robber stood guard at the entrance. Subsequently, a neighboring woman reported it to the Chinese police on guard nearby and telephoned the Hongkou Police Station in charge, who dispatched all Chinese and foreign detectives to surround the area. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest. As a result, two robbers were shot dead on the spot by the Chinese and foreign detectives. Two others were also severely injured and sent to the hospital for treatment. The bodies of the dead robbers were transported to the Forensic Examination Office on Philen Road for examination. This has been reported in detail. However, two foreign detectives were also injured in the incident and are now being treated at the Public Hospital. Afterwards, Shen Rongli, the Chinese detective chief in charge of the case, along with detectives Zhang Gui, Bao Shuji, and Cantonese detective Feng Qi, apprehended twelve more accomplices: Zheng Guangzong, Wang Acai, Lu Jinsheng, Zhang Aer, Kong Rongsheng, Yue Meisheng, Wu Peigen, Ding Guirong, Wei Baoquan, Chen Yinfa, Fan Jinyuan, and Zhu Amao, at the Baohe Hotel at No. 200 Guangdong Road, No. 714 Xiamen Road, Furenli on Beijing Road, and No. 18 Beiler Road in the French Concession. They were taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, recounted the events in detail and stated that the two injured robbers, one named Jiang Huixing and the other said to be Zhu Youlong, were in the hospital and could not be brought before the court. One dead robber was named Ma Zhengxiang, and the other was surnamed Mu. However, it was discovered that the mastermind behind the case was the defendant Zhang Aer. Zhang was employed as a rickshaw driver for the victim Wang Shaofu for over ten years. Recently, he noticed that his employer often carried hundreds of dollars in cash and that his wife, Wang Shenshi, had diamond rings and other valuable diamond jewelry. He informed the fourth defendant, Wang Acai, and discussed it for a month. Wang then invited the deceased Ma Zhengxiang and others to commit the robbery yesterday. Wang admitted this to the police without denial. The defendant Kong Rongsheng was implicated by the injured robber Jiang Huixing, who said that he was the one who supplied the firearms for the case. The other defendants denied the charges to the police. Therefore, he requested a postponement for investigation. He then presented two pistols for inspection. Then, the victim Wang Shenshi, the maid Cao Wangshi, and the neighboring woman Zhang Yeshi testified about the events. Wang Acai was questioned and confessed that a month ago, Zhang Aer came and said that there was something he could do and asked if he had any friends. He asked what it was, and Zhang Aer said that his employer, surnamed Wang, often had hundreds of dollars and diamond jewelry with him. He initially ignored it, but a few days ago, Zhang invited him again, and he discussed it with the deceased Ma Zhengxiang and agreed to commit the robbery. When questioned, Zhang Aer denied being the mastermind, saying that his employer treated him well, and he would never have such bad intentions. Kong Rongsheng testified that the injured robber Jiang Huixing, nicknamed Jiang Xiaoningbo, had committed a kidnapping case four years ago, and he had notified the police, who arrested him and sent him to the court for punishment. After serving his sentence, he was released. He held a grudge and falsely accused him of supplying the firearms. He hired Lawyer Jiang to defend him for a year. After Judge Shen Bingrong questioned the other defendants, he ordered them to be returned to custody for further investigation. Regarding the two dead robbers, the court appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to inspect the bodies at the site at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday. He examined the two dead unidentified men and determined that they had been shot and killed by the police on the spot while resisting arrest. The two bodies were handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial. Three recovered pistols were handed over to the police firearms department for safekeeping and verification.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association yesterday, stating: "We have received a letter from the Liangzhe Salt Revenue Audit Sub-Office dated the 14th of this month, which states that upon reading reports, the Chamber of Commerce has learned of the Association's initiative to solicit winter clothing for the Volunteer Army. The patriotic zeal is deeply admired. Because this office currently has a stockpile of over forty pieces of original color cotton coats and over three hundred sets of colored cotton military uniforms and pants that are no longer applicable due to the differing colors, it is proposed to allocate them to the Northeast Volunteer Army to help them withstand the cold. Please consult the Relief Association nearby to schedule a time for personnel to come to Hangzhou to collect and transport them, and please reply with details." Accordingly, the letter is recorded and forwarded, and we hope that the Association will examine and promptly send personnel to Hangzhou to collect the aforementioned clothing, transport it to the Northeast, and meet the needs of the Volunteer Army soldiers. Please inform us in advance who will be sent and on what date they will go to Hangzhou so that we can reply with details. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Continued Loan of American Wheat <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Sent Yang Ge to Shanghai Yesterday to Continue Negotiations</p>
<p>The Shanghai News Agency reports that the second loan of American wheat by the National Government was officially signed by the US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Ke Yinhang, and Military Affairs Committee Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at Chiang's villa in Lushan on the 4th of this month, as per the previous contract between the two parties. It is now learned that the agreement signed by the US and China in Lushan on the 4th was a draft agreement, not a formal contract. Finance Minister Song Ziwen has appointed American advisor Yang Ge to come to Shanghai yesterday to continue negotiations with the US representatives stationed in Shanghai. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process The motivation for this second loan of American wheat by the National Government came from the American Finance Rehabilitation Corporation, because this year's bumper harvest of agricultural products in various parts of the United States is more than three times higher than in previous years, resulting in a surplus of grain that cannot be sold. In August, it took the initiative to telegraph the Chinese government to negotiate a continuation of the loan. After Finance Minister Song Ziwen convened a meeting with all parties related to civil food to study the matter, it was deemed feasible. A telegram was immediately sent back to the American Finance Rehabilitation Corporation for further negotiations, and at the same time, the issue and the results of the meeting were telegraphed to Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan for final decision. Subsequently, Chiang replied by telegram, approving the request and telegraphed Finance Minister Song Ziwen to invite US Consul General Ke Yinhang stationed in Shanghai to Lushan for a face-to-face discussion of everything. The US and China then held a meeting at Chiang's villa in Lushan on October 4 to discuss the continued loan and sign a draft agreement. As for the formal contract, it still needs to be negotiated by the US advisor Yang Gen of the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai representative of the American Finance Rehabilitation Corporation before it can be signed.</p>
<p>Yang Ge Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Yang Ge, the American advisor to the Ministry of Finance, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday by order of Song to negotiate with the US representative stationed in Shanghai on the issue of continuing the loan of American wheat. According to Yang, the total amount of the National Government's second loan of American wheat is about 450,000 tons, worth 12 million US dollars (approximately 50 million Chinese dollars). Although the draft agreement has been signed, the formal contract still needs to be negotiated and signed. As for the method of shipping it to China in batches, the two parties have also agreed that the first batch is scheduled to start loading and shipping to China at the beginning of next month.</p>

Over two hundred people attended, including Mayor Wu, Ye Gongchuo, Li Jishen and his wife, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Qicai, Wu Kaisheng, Wang Jiyuan, Shu Xincheng, Xie Gongzhan, and Liu Haisu and his wife. The details are recorded separately below:</p>

<p>Mayor's Speech Mayor Wu said in his opening speech yesterday, "Today is the opening day of the Liu Haisu European Travel Works Exhibition held by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Thank you all for your presence and support. At the same time, I would like to thank Mr. Liu Haisu for bringing all his works from his European travels to be displayed here. The municipal government feels very grateful. Although it is the first time for a local government in China to hold a private works exhibition, we dare not claim the reputation of initiating it in Shanghai. The government should encourage and promote works that express the spirit of the country and the nation. However, in recent years, China has been busy reorganizing its internal affairs, relieving natural disasters, and resisting foreign insults, so it has had no time to pay attention to this. Shanghai is the center of Chinese culture, and the municipal government should take this opportunity to promote and encourage it. Mr. Liu Haisu's art does not need to be praised with the best adjectives. His works can tell us his expression of society and the country. This is the meaning of the Municipal Government holding the Liu Haisu European Travel Works Exhibition."</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Painting Studio The works exhibited by Liu Haisu are divided into three parts. The first part is the works before his European travel, which are displayed in the Lake Society Hall. The second part is the works from his European travels, which are displayed in the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall. The third part is the new works after his return from Europe, which are displayed in the upstairs hall of the Yingshi Memorial Hall, with a total of 225 pieces of various sizes. The most brilliant are a few of Liu's copies of "Dante and Virgil" and "Slaughter" in Paris. It is said that the exhibition period is 17 days.</p>

<p>Resolution to Organize Two Research Committees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery and National Goods Factories Joint Association held a joint meeting of the supervisory committee on the afternoon of the previous day (14th) at 6 PM at the Central Vegetable Society on Fourth Road. Over ten people attended, including Ji Jiannan, Zhu Wenqi, Lu Fengzhu, Dong Zhexian, Chen Xingwu, and Song Peidao. Zhu Wenqi was publicly elected as chairman. First, Ji Jiannan reported on the significance of the proposals for the meeting, stating that the association's affairs were mainly managed by the executive committee. However, the number of executive committee members was small, and each had their own expertise, which was a regrettable shortcoming in the full expression of the association's affairs. In order to promote the association's business, it seemed necessary to gather the strength of many people to operate together, cooperate fully, and benefit from collective wisdom and concerted efforts. In view of this, the association specially proposed at this meeting the organization of a National Goods Movement Committee, a Labor Dispute Research Committee, a Personnel Issues Committee, and a Special Incident Investigation Committee to promote the development of the association's affairs, and elaborated on the significance, tasks, and necessity of each committee. The chairman then submitted it for discussion. Subsequently, Lu Fengzhu, Bao Juting, Chen Xingwu, Wang Xingyao, Yang Weiyin, and others successively expressed their opinions. After the chairman summarized the opinions of the meeting, he submitted it for a vote. It was resolved to merge the National Goods Movement Committee and the Special Incident Investigation Committee into the National Goods Movement Committee, and to merge the Labor Dispute Research Committee and the Personnel Issues Committee into the Factory Affairs Research Committee. In addition to the members attending the meeting, eight non-attending members were publicly elected to form the committee together, and those with special research and interest were solicited to participate freely. Zhu Zhenhan was designated as the convener of the National Goods Movement Committee, and Ji Jiannan was designated as the convener of the Factory Affairs Research Committee. All organizational methods and business plans would be reported to the Executive and Supervisory Committees after being discussed by the conveners and all members.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Post-Accident Meeting of the Da Yun Steamer <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Since the Da Yun accident, Du Shaoru, the manager of Yongyu Company, convened an emergency meeting of the board of directors and supervisors yesterday (the 15th) to discuss the aftermath. Here is a record of the situation: Manager Du Shaoru reported that the company received a telegram yesterday, the 13th, at 2 PM, stating that the Da Yun had sunk in Baopu. He immediately dispatched the Dalian steamer to the scene of the accident to investigate the situation. After the Dalian steamer went, according to the report of the business director Du Yuzan, the accident was caused by the 700-foot-long stone dike in Baopu. At that time, the tide was rising and bursting. The dike water rushed south, and the ship was alongside the dock. The ship's cables were tightened, causing the water to rush south, and the ship tilted north. At the same time, when the passengers were on board and the ship was not yet docked, they flocked to the north side, causing a tragedy. Fortunately, the Yongzhou steamer and barges rescued more than a hundred people, and fifty or sixty people drowned. Whether the shipowner and others neglected their duties has been sent to the county for questioning by the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. On the one hand, more than twenty salvage workers were hired to salvage the corpses and prepare coffins for burial. The local administrative organs have notified the families of the victims to collect them separately and take care of the passengers' cargo. The competent authorities have also been reported separately by the company. In addition, the shipping schedule was adjusted, and the company's Dalian steamer was dispatched to replace the shift. For the salvage of the ship's hull, contact was made with the Wheelock &amp; Yison Shipyard, but the salvage cost exceeded the ship's cost and no agreement was reached. It is planned to contact other companies. If the salvage cost is appropriate, it will be reported again. Director Ji Youshi stood up and said that the cost at the time was more than 100,000 yuan. After ten years of operation, according to the current market price, what is the value of the ship? The manager replied that the shipping vessels have a depreciation of 20 years, which is considered fully depreciated. This ship has been operating for ten years and is only worth 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Whether it can be salvaged or re-ordered should be decided by the shareholders' meeting. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM. The reporter also spoke with Manager Du Shaoru as follows: (Q) What is the capital of your company? (A) 180,000 yuan. (Q) How many ships does the company have? (A) The Da Yun and the Dalian. (Q) How is the business situation usually? (A) Only official profits have been left over the years. (Q) How much is the loss this time? (A) In the range of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. (Q) Are there any compensations for the bereaved families and crew members? (A) This unfortunate incident is very regrettable. (Q) Will the steamer be salvaged? (A) The board of directors and supervisors will decide to publish a tender. (Q) Do you have any relationship with the establishment of various companies? (A) The companies founded by my brothers are all of a limited nature. For example, the Datong Yarn Factory only spent about 10,000 yuan on Huayi. The nature of other companies is separate and has no relationship.</p>

<p>Arrest of Xu Peiwen and others who plotted to set up gambling dens</p>
<p>In the area where Zhabei in Shanghai is both Chinese and foreign, some unscrupulous Chinese and Japanese people have been privately setting up gambling dens, enticing the ignorant to enter the dens, which is harmful to society. Mayor Wu strictly ordered an investigation. Some days ago, the gambling den organized by a certain Japanese person was sealed, and the offending Japanese person was handed over to the Japanese consul for minor punishment. Yesterday, it was reported again that Xu Peiwen and Yang Renkang, in the name of establishing a public association, obscured the registration and hoped to open a gambling den. A secret investigation confirmed this. Mayor Wu strictly ordered the Public Security Bureau of the Security Department to strictly arrest the principals and investigate. The following is the instruction of the municipal government: For the matter of instruction, it has been found that Xu Peiwen and Yang Renkang, under the guise of planning merchant connections, established a public association in Zhabei as an excuse to apply for registration with the Security Corps. Now it has been reported that Xu Peiwen, Yang Renkang, and others are swaggering outside, intending to set up a gambling den, which is illegal. If they are not severely punished, it will not be enough to maintain law and order and warn against evil. In addition to separate orders, the bureau (department) is hereby ordered to send personnel to conduct a strict investigation and quickly arrest Xu Peiwen and Yang Renkang by the deadline. Be sure to bring them to justice. Do not violate this order.</p>

<p>Shen Laobeizi Opens Fire and Chops with an Ax</p>
<p>Neighbor Hua Guangsheng Injured in the Face</p>
<p>Huang Xiaojianzi, a coppersmith from Jiangbei, 31 years old, lives in the back building of No. 16 Xiangshan Road, Xiangyan Bridge. He is friendly with his fellow villager Shen Laobeizi (30 years old). However, Shen is a vagrant. A month ago, Shen borrowed a wool clip gown and a single long shirt from Huang because he was short of money and paid the pawnshop. Ten days ago, Huang was in need of the wool clip gown to keep warm because the weather was getting colder. And recently, Shen has been working at a flower meeting and his finances have improved slightly. So he asked Shen to redeem the clothes. Who knew that after meeting, Shen became angry and embarrassed, and spoke rudely. An argument arose, which was resolved by friends. When leaving, Huang threatened Shen Laobeizi, saying that if he did not see the redeemed clothes, the flower meeting would have to be reported to the police. At about 4 AM yesterday, Shen gathered a few people and broke into Huang's residence, firing at Huang. Four shots were fired, one in the chest, the bullet exiting from the back, one in the left shoulder, one in the right leg, and one in the right wrist. Two ax wounds were inflicted on the right leg, and the wounds were very deep. Blood gushed out like a spring, and he became unconscious. When the bullets were flying, a stray bullet injured the face of his neighbor Hua Guangsheng, who sells fruit. Fortunately, the injury was light, slightly scraping his face. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in a swarm. The injured were immediately taken to Tongren Hospital by the co-residents for treatment. It is said that the injuries are serious and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Recent Situation of the Jiangwan Epidemic Hospital <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Epidemic Hospital has been open for several months, providing diagnosis and medicine free of charge. Although the epidemic has subsided slightly, the number of people seeking treatment for ordinary diseases is still very high, and it feels even busier. The directors of the hospital, Cai Xiangsun and others, in view of this, specially hired Mr. Wang Enguang as the chief physician to facilitate medical affairs and benefit patients. It is said that after Mr. Wang entered the hospital, he greatly refreshed the interior, and added a lot of medicines and equipment. He is also very meticulous and serious in terms of diagnosis and treatment, and does not allow any perfunctoriness. Therefore, the number of patients going to the hospital for treatment has been increasing day by day.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Business Community Asks for Lighthouse Construction <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from the Shanghai Timber Industry Association, Shu Jiliang; the Shanghai Sandboat Trade Association, Zhu Ziqian; and the Shanghai Flower Trade Association, Cheng Xifu, and others, submitted a request to Luo, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs; Tang, the Customs Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs; and Hu Chengyun, the Director of the Nanshi Branch of the Jianghai Customs, requesting the construction of a lighthouse to secure the ships because the old pole lights had collapsed and the journey was dangerous. The city of Nanhui, Nicheng, is located on the coast, and the southeast Huijiao is opposite to Yangshan. All the sailing boats going back and forth must pass through this road, and the tide is turbulent and the situation is extremely dangerous. And the local people here have always been tough. If a ship is stranded by the tide, they will definitely plunder it until the ship's goods are gone. Therefore, navigators are afraid of it. During the Qing Dynasty, Wang Yuzhou, a gentleman of the town, reported the above situation to the county magistrate, who reported it to the superiors. They allocated the army and stationed them in the Tianhou Palace for protection. And Tu Dong Sun Xiaopu and wood merchant Qiu Zhuxi discussed and proposed to build a light pole at the most important location to be the standard for ships to travel back and forth at night. It has been standing for more than ten years. However, because the pole is limited and the light does not reach far, ships sailing at night are still unable to travel safely. Therefore, the number of ships encountering danger has been heard from time to time. Traders and merchants have suffered losses. It is sincerely hoped that you will be sympathetic to the difficulties of the merchants, and there will be no minutiae. Therefore, we jointly request you to review and approve the appointment of a commissioner to build a lighthouse at the most important location so that ships traveling back and forth can see the bright stars early in the morning in foggy days and dark nights, and know how to avoid dangerous waters and dangerous shoals. Then the benefits for the shipping merchants will be infinite. Issued on October 15, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>In recent years, the use of electrical appliances has become increasingly widespread. For example, the small bulbs used in flashlights sell tens of thousands every day. The daily needs are all dependent on imported goods, and the rights and interests flow out, which is deeply regrettable. Recently, there are many enemy goods active in the market secretly, which is even more heartbreaking. Although there are domestically produced ones, they are mostly limited by price. Due to the cost, raw materials and equipment cannot be refined. Therefore, there are shortcomings that cannot be durable, losing the faith of the Chinese people to buy. In view of this, the Yapu Er Factory has added a new item of small bulbs for flashlights in addition to manufacturing electric fans, motors, and electric bulbs. The manufacturing method seeks to be exquisite, and the use seeks to be durable. It is also stated that if it is damaged due to insufficient specified hours, it can be exchanged, creating a new era in domestic small bulbs. It will be sold in major electrical material stores soon.</p>

<p>— ·Jing·Ji</p>
<p>"Respect the real ground, respect the void spirit; using firewood to pass on the fire, who is the master and who is the guest?"</p>
<p>This is a poem that Old Man Xiang presented to Liu Haisu; because his paintings will be exhibited in this city, a letter came asking Master Ding to write a preface, and he also painted a piece himself.</p>
<p>Asked, how to explain "real ground" and "void spirit"?</p>
<p>Old Man Xiang immediately had a wonderful analogy, saying that the character 'Su' (粟) is the answer! We looked at each other for a moment, and Old Man Xiang smiled and explained it more clearly:</p>
<p>"Breaking down the characters to explain; the character 'Hai' (海) is the void spirit, because it only has the shape and sound of water; the character 'Su' (粟) is the real ground, like the original object. Why bother to explain it in detail! Let me talk about Chinese and Western painting at random!"</p>
<p>Chinese painting, with a stroke or two of description, famous artists are good at conveying the spirit; it seems to have a philosophical meaning! Mo Jing called it "divine ease". In fact, it is all empty depiction. When painting a human face, it is not necessary to have all the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose! Western painting is sometimes very strange... painting a human head, depicting a fish body... like the Egyptian sphinx; it is also called a great art. When we look at it, we don't feel any meaning!</p>
<p>Now Chinese and Western painting are learning from each other. It is truly "using firewood to pass on the fire"; let's see in the future, in the comparison and competition, who will be more victorious in the history of painting!</p>
<p>We originally wanted to ask about Mr. Haisu and nude paintings; then we thought that recent reports said that the German government had ordered a ban on nude sports, saying it was a sign of cultural decline; Old Man Xiang certainly wouldn't say complimentary words either!</p>
<h3 id="e205">Seeking Help from Others is Not as Good as Seeking Help from Yourself <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— ·Guo·Wei·Ran</p>
<p>| I hope the countrymen will be keenly aware |</p>
<p>Seeking help from others is not as good as seeking help from yourself – this saying, although a commonplace, has a profound meaning. The root of the national character lies in reliance. When doing things in society, one must first have a backer. I ask, which administrative personnel does not have a backer? If the mountain is not high, the backing is not solid. Once the mountain collapses, the backing falls. This is what is meant by "the creeper loses its shade." If this nature is not changed, one person is not cultivated, one family is not regulated, one country is not governed, and the world is not at peace. Changing customs depends entirely on the refinement of education. Those who are responsible, why not start doing it!</p>
<p>"Weak countries have no diplomacy," this saying is most opposed by the high-sounding gentlemen. China is a weak country, which is undeniable. However, is it really a weak country? I believe that the strength or weakness of a country depends entirely on human effort. If you want to turn weakness into strength, it is not impossible. As the saying goes, "It is not that we cannot do it, but that we do not do it." Will China continue to be in chaos? It depends on the administrative leaders restraining themselves and recommending the worthy, and striving for the permanent happiness of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>The League of Nations is unreliable, everyone in China and abroad says. The League of Nations is a group of imperialists. Japan, an imperial power, is one of the five great powers. The League of Nations naturally cannot but perfunctorily deal with it. Like our great China, as if it were a numb sleeping lion, who would bother to care about you? Supporting the weak and suppressing the strong is just such a "platitude." Among nations, there is only "combination of interests," and there is no "international trust"!</p>
<p>"Seeking help from others is not as good as seeking help from yourself." I hope that the central government can truly wholeheartedly correct the military warlordism, concentrate political power, and concentrate the nation's talent and economy to work for national salvation by internal pacification and external resistance. Defeating Japan is the beginning of destroying the walls of all imperialists. Once Japanese imperialism collapses, there will be hope for equality in the world!</p>

<p>| In the end, you're just asking for trouble |</p>
<p>A young master chased after a modern young lady every day, went through all kinds of hardships, and obtained the permission of both families. The lovers became family members, but unexpectedly, before the honeymoon was over, he didn't return home at night. Someone asked him, and he just said... "She made me suffer before, now I make her suffer, to get revenge on her." As a result, the two sides broke up, and he had no choice but to take out a large sum of alimony. There was a Mr. Zhang who used to open a silk weaving factory in Zhabei. After Zhabei was burned down, he was extremely frustrated. Unexpectedly, he recently opened an even larger silk weaving factory than before. I really admire his ability. One day I ran into him on the road and asked him the details. He said, "I was burned into a pauper by the Japanese, but now I'm still making money off of them. Alas! The revenge of a treacherous merchant." Now I see the workers of the anti-treachery group being worried all day long.</p>
<p>The naughty student Lu made a mess in the classroom every day, and the teacher couldn't think of a way. He marked him with a major demerit, and he frantically contacted several modern young masters who used studying as a front, and made a big fuss, insisting on overthrowing the teacher before attending class. In the end, he was still expelled by the school authorities. Alas! He was really asking for trouble.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Young People in Love, Be Careful <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— ·Cheng·Da</p>
<p>| Here's a deadly story for you |</p>
<p>In general, modern young men and women like to be in love. That's right, it's a natural psychology. But you must know that the power of love is the greatest. It can easily make you successful and happy, and it can also easily make you negative and decadent. Now there is a very good, very tortuous, and very meaningful story. This story is roughly like this... There was a college student who was initially a decadent figure, but soon he had a lover. He was excited, he worked hard, but unexpectedly good things are often hard-won, and he mistakenly thought that his lover's brother was his rival in love, and he became negative again. He was thinking of committing suicide to end his life, but his lover saved him, understood everything, and the lovers finally got married.</p>
<p>This story shows... (1) The only obstacles to love are "doubt" and "jealousy." (2) The success of love is not easy without going through a twist. (3) For the sake of love, one can be excited, but also not want to live. This shows how great the power of love is.</p>
<p>It is said that the Mingxing Film Company's new film "Love and Life" has adopted such a story. Of course, our college students will definitely rush to see it, because after seeing it, at least we can know what love is all about, and how the success of this matter is like.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Design of Cocoon Room without Pupae <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— ·Tian·Xu·Wo·Sheng</p>
<p>My purpose is to make the silkworm pupae not in the cocoon, and without the consumption of silk spitting head, the silk spun by each silkworm can be completely used for normal purposes, and the cocoon baking procedure is avoided, so this design is made, which has many benefits... No silkworm nests are needed, reducing the location, first; the silkworm's feces and urine are not in the cocoon, the surface and inside are pure and clean, and the silk is not disordered, second; the pupae are not inside, the weight of the cocoon is the weight of pure silk, and the selling price is high, third; no fire baking is needed, there is no worry about moths emerging, the labor cost is reduced, the production is increased, and the quality is excellent, fourth; each room houses 150 silkworms, only three inches high, only one foot long, and about half a foot wide, slightly like an abacus, which can be stacked like a brick wall. But there is only two feet of land, about ten feet long, stacked six feet high, which can hold three hundred rooms, and each time one hundred catties of pupa-free cocoons can be collected, which is light, convenient, and suitable for women. The system is described below...</p>
<p>Use a two-tenths-thick board to make the walls around, one and a half inches high, seven inches wide, and twelve inches long, without a cover. The bottom is made of a four-tenths-thick board, drilled with three-tenths-inch diameter holes, ten holes vertically, and fifteen holes horizontally, shaped like a drawer inside a matchbox. Use cardboard inside to divide it into 150 square grids, each grid six tenths of an inch square. Cut thin cardboard like cigarette paper, one and a half inches wide and two and a half inches long, roll it into a cylinder on a wooden stick, without gluing it firmly, so that it can roll and stretch. Then insert this roll into each square grid, so that the inner layer becomes circular. Four legs are attached to the bottom of the box, one inch high, and the total height is only three inches. If this is prepared, the mechanized cost for every 300 rooms is only thirty to fifty yuan, and it can be used for at least a dozen years. Even if there is damage, it is only the inner cardboard, and each replacement costs only a few cents. (Note: The boards must be steamed and boiled to remove resin and its odor, and the cardboard must also remove harmful substances such as sulfur and lime or bleaching powder. But for small trials, it is okay to use ordinary market goods, even if there is a loss, it is very small.)</p>
<p>Any silkworms that can go up the mountain during normal times are moved under the bottom of the box, with the silkworm's body introduced into the hole, and its tail exposed outside the bottom plate. Once half of the silkworm's body has entered the hole, it makes a cocoon in the paper roll. The excrement and leakage are all outside the bottom of the box, which can be lined with paper, making it easy to stack and not stain the lower rooms. When the silkworm spins silk, it thinks it is in the cocoon and does not see the light, so it does not turn its head, and gradually spins and retreats backward, until the silk is spun, and the pupa forms under the bottom of the box, not in the cocoon.</p>
<p>The procedure for collecting cocoons is very simple. Just pull the paper roll upwards and unfold it, which is more convenient than collecting cocoons on a cocoon cluster. The paper roll is still placed in the square grid for secondary use. The cycle is endless, and the cost of labor and materials saved in a year is not a small amount. And the cocoons do not need to be baked, which can avoid the disadvantages of suppression; waiting for the price to sell, there is no worry about stale cocoons, and they can be pressed and packaged, which is also more convenient for transportation.</p>
<p>The above plan is based on the fact that the annual production of silk floss is very large. Producing one more catty of silk floss reduces the cocoon price for silkworm farmers. The silk woven from silk floss is called cotton silk, because it is made of broken silk, which is joined into threads, so there are strands of particles floating on the silk surface, which can be stretched when pulled, which greatly reduces the price of the silk. Although it has been promoted this year to improve dyeing, and there are many users, the price is very low, and it does not benefit silkworm farmers. I want to correct this problem, and must make the silkworm pupae not in the cocoon, so that the risk of moths biting out can be avoided, so the above design is made. I sincerely hope that the financiers who are engaged in the rural lending business will adopt this new type of cocoon room, distribute it to silkworm farmers and collect their cocoons, counting by the number of cocoons instead of by the catty, then they will not change their shortsightedness and will definitely be happy to do it. (An average of 450 cocoons with pupae per catty) But by receiving one city, it is enough to change the habits of several years, and receive the benefit of a permanent solution. Foreign companies will also be happy to purchase this kind of "pupa-free cocoon," which can reduce all kinds of doubts, and the saved water and transportation costs can also be reduced by more than half.</p>
<p>Now is the period for autumn silkworms to go to the cocoon cluster, so make small trials to determine the plan for a large-scale implementation next spring, so that a factory can be specially built to prepare machinery to specialize in the manufacture of this product, and it can be supplied in time to help the rural economy, so that it will not be just empty talk on paper. I sincerely wish and pray for its success.</p>

<p>Lu Boqin let out a sigh of relief, and took out a handkerchief to wipe the beads of sweat that shouldn't be hot but were flowing down his forehead. Tong Yizhen suddenly snatched the umbrella over, and said softly, "You should be relieved now, right? There doesn't seem to be any need to discuss other things at this time. I'm sorry, I have something to do, I have to go back."</p>
<p>"You're leaving in such a hurry, it's obvious that you're still angry with me. Yizhen! It's rare to go out together, can you spend half an hour more with me, and stroll around this park?" Lu Boqin was very earnest in trying to keep her.</p>
<p>"Alright! So you don't feel uneasy, I'll walk around with you again." Tong Yizhen indifferently agreed to his request, and the two turned back and strolled. When they first arrived at the lotus pond, they leaned on the railing and looked around. The lotus flowers had already bloomed, leaving only some lotus pods and lotus leaves, all in dark green, which felt very monotonous. Seeing that there was nothing interesting, they walked through the Lake Heart Pavilion to the Four Sides Hall. There were tea tables there, which seemed very clean. Lu Boqin wanted to take this opportunity to get her to say a few more words:</p>
<p>"Let's find a clean seat and have some tea before we leave, okay?"</p>
<p>"There are too many people, it's not good."</p>
<p>"Then, there are boats in the river, let's rent one and go boating."</p>
<p>Tong Yizhen pondered for a moment, and finally declined, saying... "I really have something to do, I have to go back, let's go boating another day."</p>
<p>Seeing that she was still listless, Lu Boqin didn't force her anymore, and gave her a lift: "In that case, I'm not happy to play here anymore, I'll go out with you and hire a car to take you home."</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Since the meeting at Wanquan Park, Tong Yizhen has indeed been a bit colder towards Lu Boqin, but she still goes to the English night school every night, and Lu Boqin still has the opportunity to explain or comfort her at any time, and also inquire about the situation of the Tong family.</p>
<p>Adjutant Gao kept coming to Commander Li to act as a matchmaker. Tong Yizhen's aunt and uncle coveted wealth and naturally were willing to climb this high-ranking family. But that position of fifth concubine, Tong Yizhen had to be willing to do it; in this civilized era, they could no longer carry out the violent act of snatching a bride like in the Middle Ages. So the enthusiastic aunts and uncles could not have an open discussion with their niece.</p>

<p>— ·Fo</p>
<p>In the third year of the Republic, I wrote a book called "Lectures on Boasting and Flattery" (the book was banned by Yuan Shikai not long after its publication). There is a section in it that roughly says that boasting and flattery are linked, and have positive and negative properties. For example, those who are good at boasting must like to flatter, and those who like to flatter must be good at boasting. I also cite historical facts to prove it. In fact, humans are originally materialistic animals. Assuming you see through some things, you can always see it in politics or society.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw in the newspaper that when President Hoover was laying the cornerstone for the new building of the local Supreme Court, he held a reception at the White House, inviting a total of 4,000 guests. The guests were honored to shake hands with the President. About two-thirds of the 4,000 people had already shaken hands. At that time, the President's right hand was slightly broken and bleeding, probably due to being squeezed too hard. After being advised by a doctor, he retired, so the remaining guests felt disappointed. This strange situation is completely a manifestation of vanity, and this vanity is a combination of boasting and flattery.</p>
<p>The President is one of the people with round heads, square feet, horizontal eyes, and accurate noses, and the common people are also people with round heads, square feet, horizontal eyes, and accurate noses. We are all human beings, we are all one person. Why is a handshake an honor, and why is not shaking hands a humiliation? However, the psychology of the general guests is very different. From this, it can be seen that foreigners' vanity is richer than that of our country. Moreover, the United States is a democratic country. When the President's term expires, he becomes a commoner. Once a commoner is elected, he becomes the President. Therefore, the President and the common people are only separated by a narrow gap. Therefore, Western philosophers say that the President is the servant of the people. Since he is a servant, why is shaking hands an honor, and why is not shaking hands a humiliation?</p>
<p>If we extrapolate from this, then if the emperor of the autocratic era were to shake hands with a commoner, what would be the honor? I once saw a book (it was probably Suiyuan Shihua, and I can't remember the exact words, but the facts seem like this): When Emperor Shizu of the Qing Dynasty made a southern tour, the abbot of a certain monastery went out to greet him. The Emperor grabbed his arm. Since then, the monk only raised his left hand to express respect when receiving any benefactors, because his right hand had been in contact with the Emperor and would not be raised easily. I used to laugh at people in the Buddhist community for being the most materialistic and the best at flattery. If the Emperor were to stroke his beard, the monk would not eat for a long time. Originally, I said that the development of vanity was greater than that of our country, but now seeing such a situation in the United States, I can't help but sigh with admiration. But is this kind of vanity itself a bad habit, or is it an opportunity for good? I say it is an opportunity for good. Humans cannot be without this vanity. Because China lacks this vanity, we are allowed to be trampled on by others without any resistance. If there were some vanity, we would not be trampled on by foreigners like this.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Natural Lacquer <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— ·Shen·Er·Ming</p>
<p>Everyone knows the uses of lacquer. It is an important coating material. Ironware can be protected from rust after being lacquered, and woodenware is beautiful, durable, and most notably with natural lacquer. Therefore, I have written the general knowledge of it below.</p>
<p>(1) Collecting the Liquid This part of the procedure is extremely important. If you cut and slash it at will, the loss of lacquer liquid will not be small. Therefore, I will describe it first. Lacquerers often work in the mountains and proceed slowly and deliberately. Trees less than ten years old are not used. Large trees are tapped three times a year, medium trees twice, and small trees once. Each large tree yields about twenty taels of lacquer, and small trees about fifteen taels.</p>
<p>For wild trees, make a cut on the bark seven inches from the ground, six or seven inches long and about two tenths of an inch deep. When the lacquer is not flowing well, you can use water to moisturize it. When the lacquer is about to run out, you can place grass on the top of the tree and scorch it. Cut the tree to the roots, and the remaining lacquer will flow out from the wound.</p>
<p>For planted trees, make three cuts in a triangle shape, and the lacquer liquid flows out from both sides. Use a bamboo tube to hold it. Each time, a wild large tree can be cut in more than twenty places. Collect it with a bamboo tube every three hours. When the tube is full, transfer it to a lacquer bucket and cover it with hemp paper. The lacquer liquid collected at the beginning is opaque and contains water, so it needs to be purified. The method is to put the lacquer liquid in a shallow pan and expose it to the hot sun. It can be cleaned in three hours. Stir it from time to time to help the water vapor evaporate. When the whole body turns purple, use hemp cloth or cotton to clean it and store it in porcelain.</p>
<p>(2) Preparation Mix 1,000 parts of lacquer with 8 parts of iron filings, or 100 parts of lacquer with 5 parts of acetic acid, to get black lacquer.</p>
<p>Mix 128 parts of lacquer with 1 part of bone charcoal and 10 parts of cooked tea oil to get black glossy lacquer.</p>
<p>Mix lacquer with an equal amount of perilla oil, add water and mix well, cook to remove water, and mix with pigments to get porcelain glossy enamel.</p>
<p>Mix lacquer with 90 parts of cinnabar to get vermilion lacquer.</p>
<p>Mix lacquer with an equal amount of cooked tung oil to form a firm and glossy film. It is used to coat woodenware, does not cover the wood grain, and is resistant to moisture.</p>
<p>(3) Quality According to Mr. Yoshida's research, lacquer acid (Laccicacid) accounts for 85% of refined lacquer. The other 15% is colloid, brewing substance (i.e. nitrogenous body), and water. Lacquer hardens when it meets air, which is due to the action of the brewing substance. Therefore, if the brewing substance is destroyed by heat, it will not harden. Usually, the hardening time takes ten hours. Adding a small amount of glycerin only takes two hours.</p>
<p>Lacquer with more colloid is inferior, and lacquer with more acid is better. The most suitable temperature for drying lacquer liquid is between 10 and 30 degrees Celsius. When drying, the lacquer liquid is heavy and can increase in weight. How much it increases depends on the length of time.</p>

<p>| How to deal with stray children on the streets |</p>
<p>If you are an old hand at taking streetcars in Shanghai and have a bit of experience, then you will find that there is an annoying thing: the beggars at the streetcar stops.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, I was waiting for a bus at Dongxinqiao. At this time, there was a child of only six or seven years old, barefoot, with tattered clothes, holding a cigarette case in his hand, squeezing through the crowd to beg. At a young age, he had learned a mouthful of complimentary words. He followed behind the passers-by with words like "Master, young master, cultivate good fortune, get rich." At that time, a young man in a suit was walking by with a modern girl. The child spared no effort and went to nail him, following him for about dozens of steps. Finally, due to his perseverance, he received a copper coin donation. He happily jumped to the pancake stall at the intersection of Zhejiang Road across the street, combined the two copper coins originally in the box, bought a pancake, and sat on the side of the road to eat. Seeing his happy expression, even if the head of the family was eating ginseng and poria cocos cake, it would not be enough to compare. I was moved by his innocent expression at Futai, and I really felt dumbfounded. If such children were born in wealthy families, it would be the time to sit in a chartered car to go to school, but now they are wandering on the streets, running around begging for food, so that they are in contact with the bad environment every day. They are not blessed to share the material civilization of the city; but for all the evils of the city, they have long understood and learned from what they hear and see. When they grow up, how can they be asked to be good citizens?</p>
<p>There are probably quite a few stray children like this who are not taught or raised in Shanghai. They are educated on the streets, and they grow up in hunger and cold. What they live is an inhuman life. If they have a chance to get ahead in the future, they will only become a street thug who relies on the road to eat. This forms the vagrant class, so the society must address the root causes of eliminating vagrants and should start by taking in and educating poor and educating children, teaching them a skill so that they can become a part of production. In this way, the evils of society must be reduced a lot. This is not only creating blessings for children, but also the responsibility that those who are in charge of local administration should bear.</p>
<p>Among these many stray children, if they are educated, wouldn't there be one or two great heroes, but they have not been polished? Although our country has a large population, talents are buried due to the lack of universal education, which is really difficult to calculate. The people are the foundation of the country, and children are the masters of the future. Who can believe and practice these words? Ordinary people do not care about the heavy social problem, why are they not paying attention? Many wealthy people in Shanghai are afraid of being kidnapped, and they hire bodyguards at home to protect them, but they are not willing to give some relief to those who are going to do the kidnapping. It is really puzzling.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Shanghai has the Songhu Education and Training Institute and the Vagrant Practice Institute to take in vagrants, but neither of them is based on children. There are many inconveniences in management and education. I think we should set up a poor children's education and training institute with a large scale to take in the children of ordinary poor families, teach them ordinary knowledge - the level should be between national primary schools and civil schools, and add industrial and vocational training so that they have a skill to make a living in the future.</p>
<p>Educators, philanthropists, and people who care about social issues, please run one less aristocratic kindergarten, and run this paradise to create blessings for poor children! I hereby submit this idea for public discussion.</p>

<p>— ·洪·水</p>
<p>After the Lucky Candy Store was inadvertently burned down, Jinbao also fell into terrible unemployment. Time flew by, and he spent a year in worry and sorrow! The hard-pressed life of constant distress was truly unbearable. He thought of committing suicide, if it weren't for his virtuous wife and beloved son. Now his only hope was that Xiaolian would grow up soon, start a family and career, and become a reliable support in his old age. But the reality was such: "The colder it gets, the stronger the wind blows; the poorer you are, the more likely you are to get sick." This was absolutely true; Jinbao blankly and reluctantly watched his clever and lively child, blessed with natural talent, die of illness! As a result, his wife went mad and sometimes went to the local temple to pray to the gods, hoping to ward off disaster and have a son. Now Wu Jianguang predicted that the old couple would have good luck in their old age soon; either they would build up their family business, or they would have a precious child in their old age. Therefore, they unconsciously forgot about their beloved son, Xiaolian!</p>
<p>Dusk grew heavy, and Jinbao's hope sank into obscurity along with the setting sun in the western mountains.</p>
<p>"Jinbao, will we run out of rice tomorrow?!" At the dinner table, his wife, deeply frowning, started to say to her husband in a miserable and sorrowful tone.</p>
<p>"Oh!" He sighed deeply, his distracted eyes looking at his wife's equally sallow and haggard face. He was afraid, and he lowered his head, as if he had a belly full of pain that he couldn't express.</p>
<p>"Alas! Do you want to make things even more difficult for me? Jinbao, Jinbao!"</p>
<p>"My dear, what do you want me to do? I'm unemployed! Didn't the fortune teller predict that I would have good luck in my old age? Don't worry for now! One day, my luck will turn, and I'll have a chance to make a fortune!"</p>
<p>"Heh!"</p>
<p>"I'm thinking of inviting a few relatives and friends to start a hui (rotating credit association) for two hundred silver dollars, to start a small business. Once it succeeds, then many problems in life won't be a problem." "What are you planning to do?"</p>
<p>"The freshly harvested Liangxiang chestnuts from Tianjin."</p>
<p>In a few days, perhaps Jinbao's good luck was about to arrive! His plan actually succeeded and was realized. He set up a chestnut stall at a corner of a bustling and crowded road, and he even publicly hung up a very eye-catching glass sign with gold lettering that read "Roadside Immortal." Jinbao, full of joy, was busy roasting chestnuts and packaging them, and he also knew that selling chestnuts required playing a phonograph to attract customers. "Farewell My Concubine," "The Fox Spirit Replacing the Prince," and "Suzhou Scenery" played non-stop in rotation. Besides donating five silver dollars to the road association and a few bags of chestnuts to the patrol officers, they generally made three or four yuan per day on average. They were so excited that they thought of the fortune teller's words and became even more overjoyed. Tonight, the stall was full of people, and business was unexpectedly booming. Jinbao, roasting chestnuts and looking at his wife, had an air of invincibility! His wife nodded and showed a smug smile, when suddenly two "uninvited guests" dressed in all black and looking fierce squeezed into the crowd. In an instant, the empty box flew into the sky, seemingly heading towards the owner who was standing there silently in a daze. The air was obviously chaotic, with shouts of "Catch, catch, catch the thieves!" Jinbao fainted next to the stove, motionless, while his wife jumped around! Their fate was thus inevitably pushed into a desperate situation.</p>

<p>······與一百年以前法國傅利葉監督將小麥抛棄海中事實同類······</p>
<p>······Similar to the fact that Fourier supervised the dumping of wheat into the sea in France a hundred years ago······</p>
<p>其實這種現象，並不奇怪，而且平常，古人不也說過麽，「朱門酒肉臭，路有餓死骨，」只是這純然是文學的口吻，描寫世界上的人，吃的吃不了，沒吃的餓得肚皮呌，暗示着人類生活如此不平·而沒有像社會科學那樣的加以闡明罷了。</p>
<p>In fact, this phenomenon is not strange, but common. Didn't the ancients also say, "Behind vermilion gates, meat and wine rot, while by the roadside, there are bones of those who died of hunger?" It's just that this is purely a literary tone, describing how some people in the world have more than they can eat, while others are so hungry that their stomachs are rumbling, implying that human life is so unequal, but it doesn't explain it in the way that social science does.</p>
<p>是大前天傍晚，我忽然想走到吳淞路去，於是果眞走去了，唯一的目的，自然因爲那是一條衣店馬路，天氣有些寒冷了，想去買一件起碼的絨綫衣着着，免得賤體冷壞了，喊娘喊爹！請不到醫生，住不起醫院，事實偏偏那麽捉弄人，衣店裏的定價，都與我的意思相差天遠，使我白走了一趟，慢慢地蹁到了天鐘路口，那兒正簇聚着一羣羣的呌化，灰黄色的電光，映射着他們的形相，有老婆婆，老頭兒，小孩子，衣裳是襤褸齷齷，露骨的皮肉，活像蘇詶河裏的爛泥，有的蹲着脚亂手忙，有的立在旁邊嚷呌，我知道那是無法衝進的陣圍，只好耐着性子站在近旁，等他們走散後，看到底是怎樣一回事。</p>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, I suddenly wanted to walk to Wusong Road, so I actually went. The only purpose, of course, was because it was a street with clothing stores. The weather was a bit cold, and I wanted to buy at least a woolen sweater to wear, so that my humble body wouldn't get cold and I wouldn't have to cry for my mom and dad! I couldn't afford a doctor or a hospital. The fact is, fate plays tricks on people. The prices in the clothing stores were so far from what I wanted, that I made a trip for nothing. I slowly staggered to the intersection of Tianzhong Road, where groups of beggars were gathered. The greyish-yellow electric light reflected their figures. There were old women, old men, and children. Their clothes were ragged and filthy, and their exposed flesh looked like the rotten mud in the Suzhou River. Some were squatting down, scrambling with their hands, while others were standing beside them, shouting. I knew that it was impossible to break into that encirclement, so I had to patiently stand nearby and wait for them to disperse before seeing what was going on.</p>
<p>這時候，我的腦海裏掀起了思索的旋廻，雖然猜不正那究竟是什麽一回事，但至少可以預定是與人類生活有關，尤其與低級的平民生活有關，他們不是在搶吃的食品，便是在搶爛衣及其他。　　正在沉思，他們畢竟嘩然一亂走散了，原來走來了两個紅頭阿三，手裏拿着哭喪棒，兇兇地在驅打，我走近前去，仔細端詳，那兒還殘賸着一大堆的腐爛了的黄瓜。</p>
<p>At this time, a whirlwind of thought arose in my mind. Although I couldn't guess exactly what was going on, I could at least predict that it was related to human life, especially to the lives of low-level commoners. They were either抢吃ing food or抢烂ing rotten clothes and other things. While I was pondering, they suddenly scattered in a chaotic rush. It turned out that two "Red-Heads" (Indian policemen) had come, holding mourning sticks in their hands and fiercely driving them away. I went closer and carefully examined the scene. There was still a large pile of rotten cucumbers left there.</p>
<p>黄瓜，這時候多麽可口呵！</p>
<p>Cucumbers, how delicious they are at this time!</p>
<p>在温帶，那是要夏天才有的蔬果，在夏天天然是不希奇·然一到了秋天，總算是珍貴的食品了，因爲要從南方廣東運來，在一般的食品店裏，這時候是沒有的了，（霞飛路一帶的食品店中，自然陳列多着·）雖然一般人所需要的還是麵包，沒有口福去嘗試這過時佳品的滋味，但該當如何的珍視它！而今竟把它腐爛，抛棄，這是何等奇怪的務盾現象！</p>
<p>In the temperate zone, cucumbers are vegetables and fruits that are only available in summer. In summer, they are naturally not rare. However, once autumn arrives, they are considered precious foods because they have to be transported from Guangdong in the south. In general food stores, they are not available at this time (naturally, there are many on display in food stores around Avenue Joffre). Although what ordinary people need is still bread, and they don't have the good fortune to try the taste of this out-of-season delicacy, how much should they cherish it! Yet now it is rotten and discarded. What a strange and contradictory phenomenon!</p>
<p>我思忖過後，與頭一望，原來就在XX蔬果行的店前，那兒的玻璃裏還陳列着各種貴重的新鮮食品，更使我憶起一百年以前法國一件同類，意義尤較重大的事實。</p>
<p>After thinking it over, I looked up and saw that it was right in front of the XX fruit and vegetable store. Various valuable and fresh foods were still on display in the glass window, which made me recall a similar, even more significant, event in France a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>那是如此的；</p>
<p>It was like this:</p>
<p>大約離今一百年前，法國有一人名呌傅利葉，他年幼時在馬賽一個糧食店裏工作，有一天那糧食店裏要將從停泊馬賽港的船舶輸入的小麥抛棄到海裏去，他受命去做這事的監督，當時法國正遇着凶荒，缺少小麥，多數窮人，都以馬鈴，薯代麵包吃，可是那些糧食商人，却還爲着抬高小麥價錢，將輸入的小麥匿藏船裏，以致小麥腐爛，着人抛棄海中，一方面有多數要小麥而無小麥可吃的人，他方面又有特意將輸入的小麥使其腐爛而棄海裏的人·這究竟是什麽一回事呢？傅利葉看見這種奇怪的現象，就起了一個欵問·以爲現在的社會組織，一定有了什麽缺陷，從此以後，他就犧牲他一生去研究理想社會的組織。　　其實這是很平常的事實，只是於今爲烈，我們該怎樣去應付這矛盾現象呵</p>
<p>About a hundred years ago, there was a man in France named Fourier. When he was young, he worked in a grain store in Marseille. One day, the grain store was going to dump wheat imported from ships docked in the port of Marseille into the sea. He was ordered to supervise this matter. At that time, France was experiencing a famine and was short of wheat. Most poor people ate potatoes instead of bread, but the grain merchants were still hiding the imported wheat in ships to raise the price of wheat, causing the wheat to rot and ordering people to dump it into the sea. On the one hand, there were many people who wanted wheat but had no wheat to eat, and on the other hand, there were people who deliberately caused the imported wheat to rot and dumped it into the sea. What exactly was going on? When Fourier saw this strange phenomenon, he had a question. He believed that there must be some flaws in the current social organization. From then on, he sacrificed his life to study the organization of an ideal society. In fact, this is a very common fact, but it is even more intense today. How should we deal with this contradictory phenomenon?</p>
